- [Narrator] The globe has spun around many times before the probing eye of the motion picture camera. So many times, in fact, that you may wonder if there's anything left to discover. But to the persistently curious, the world continually reveals new secrets and sights. As Shakespeare put it, there are more things in heaven and earth, and between sunset and dawn, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Therefore, Ecco, which means look, witness, observe, and behold. We show you a world beyond your most outrageous fantasies. This is the wall in Berlin, a city which is still expiating guilt as frightful as its ruins. In the wasteland of these blank, desolate walls, a heroic and useless song loses itself. A song that seems to guide us towards the secrets and contradictions of the German circle. These young men are members of a secret dueling society. They are college students of the new Germany, a Germany of pride and accomplishment, of shame and penance. A people that gave the world Goethe, Beethoven, Einstein, and Mozart. A nation that made lampshades of human skin. A law has been passed in this new Germany forbidding the practice of dueling, but these students band together in a secret society and defy that law and practice Mensur. Mensur, the strange, harsh word the German students use to designate a duel fought not to kill but to slash the opponent's face. (speaking in German) The combat has ancient rules. The face, for example, must remain absolutely immobile during the duel. This lucky lad is the happy winner of the contest, while his opponent, unmarked, must fight again. Next month, perhaps he will be the lucky holder of this stupid and unnecessary badge in courage. There is a time for violence and a time for peace. To sleep, perchance to dream. Ah, there's the rub. These Japanese babies are not allowed to sleep the sleep of the innocent. Japanese have, for some time, pioneered with hypno-pedagogy, the process of educating one's self by listening to records while sleeping. In particular, this process has been very successful in teaching languages, but now the Japanese have gone a step further and carried it into the nursery. They do not shrink from disturbing the tender dreams of babyhood with the pounding radio repetition of exultations to be good, sleep tight, don't cry, don't wet the bed. Eat all your baby food, love mummy and daddy, and do not sink other people's battleships without first declaring war. Perhaps those dreams of infancy weren't so tender after all. One of those little angels may one day grow up to be a champion of karate. Karate, the art of the empty hand, is a deadly style of fighting. As with many things, the Japanese learned it from another nation and perfected it. When their troops landed on the small Pacific island of Luchow early in the 17th century, they immediately confiscated all the inhabitants' weapons. However, they soon learned that the weapons were of no importance to the islanders as those peaceful natives were able to split a skull with a blow from each of their hands or crush a chest with their fingertips. The troops quickly made peace with these all too dangerous foes and returned to Japan with the secret of karate. There are 72 blows with the hands and feet in karate which kill instantly. The other hundreds of blows are merely designed to paralyze, maim, or disable one's opponent. Unlike Judo, this is an offensive, not defensive, weapon. The secret of these blows which seem to upset the natural scale of hardness depends on the driving rapidity with which they are delivered, and the rigidity of the joints of the arm or leg delivering the blows. These are two inch thick concrete roofing tiles. In addition, and since we're in the far east, a great spiritual concentration is essential. Only a truly extraordinary advance could cause such excitement at Great Alexandre, the most famous hairdresser in the world. These girls are debutantes preparing for the fabulous night that comes to them but once in a lifetime, and to most women never. This splendid occasion is reserved for the privileged few. Jewels valued at more than two billion francs are paraded with the grace and nonchalance seen only in the young, the rich and the proud. A fairy tale come true. These girls have gathered in Paris on New Year's Eve to make their formal entrance into an adult society of the elegant debutantes ball in the Paris Opera. Bearing the proudest names in the Almanach de Gotha, they have been selected from the major countries of Europe to make their curtsies in the classic manner, as if there were still a queen to receive them. Bowing low before the signs of the ancient noble houses for whose sons they reserve the jealously guarded gift of their name, their wealth, and their fresh purity. The same night, the same Paris, the clochard, beggars and thieves of Paris, rebels against the world, celebrate in the name of absolute freedom from their fellow men, from money, families, and from washing. Every New Year's Eve they too throw a ball and have a big night. It is a very exclusive affair to which gaining admittance is most difficult. Tourists, sightseers and our camera must be satisfied to spy on them with the crude violence of search lights. This ball has no dreams and no illusions, but it is full of hilarity, a cruel, almost provocative hilarity. This is another fairy tale come true, but peopled with witches and demons rather than princes and princesses. The circus has come to St. Gotthard, a small village in the French Alps. There are no rings, no lights, no tents. Today, as 100 years ago, the circus is represented to these remote little villages by individual families of performers traveling from town to town, performing their acts to the wonderment of the villagers. We give you then in the center ring, the (indecipherable), presently an incredible prospect, suspended dangerously on their slender wire in the snowy dusk of this little French village. 750 pounds suspended on the 1800 foot length of one inch cable with only the sky above and the cold hard ground below. Millions of years ago, the waters withdrew from this land that later became Greece, leaving mysterious giant stone fingers upon the plane pointed toward heaven. When barbarian tribes overwhelmed this land, looting its treasures, burning the beautiful cities of Rome and Constantinople, destroying the very roots of civilization, holy priests climbed these forbidding rocks to hide the great libraries there, to save for prosperity the accumulated wisdom of centuries. Later others climbed up, men to whom the presence of God could only be made manifest in places most severely isolated from the rest of the world. Thus began the first monasteries. These inaccessible rocks are called meteors, and at sunset they present a truly unearthly lunar aspect. In caves halfway between the plane and the monasteries, a few hermits live abjuring the world with the same resolute passion that drove the anchorites of early Christian times into the desert. This young priest is on his way to enter one of the monasteries. He will spend his life there in reverent contemplation, caring for the precious libraries of the past. The founders gave exalted names to these monasteries. The monastery of transfiguration. The monastery of quietude. But how does one reach transfiguration? How arrive at quietude? There are no roads and the divine fisherman receives into his net only those few who are elect of God. No priest comes down in this net. When he takes his vows, he contracts with God to remain in this place forever. Not even his bones rejoin the world below, but rest eternally in quiet communion with those who went before him. Dunsmore, a park and castle only a few miles from London. Voltaire wrote there are no more witches since we stopped burning them. He was wrong. In England today there are more than 500 registered organizations that practice black magic to subdue the forces of life and reveal their mysteries. The people gathering here are from the shops, the offices, and even the mansions of London. Clerks, carpenters and countesses with a mutual bond. They sincerely believe in the existence and the power of the supreme spirit of evil, Satan. They believe so completely and unquestioningly that they were afraid to allow our cameras inside their church. Since we were non-believers, they were convinced that we would instantly be struck down by the forces of evil which they were about to call into attendance. We can only peer through the gratings of the windows and the skylight on the roof to spy on this demoniac initiation. All this in a castle only a few miles from London. Even 30, parts of the ritual were omitted because of our presence. Since the practice of witchcraft in England is subject to government control, the modern black mass is a pale symbolic version of the original atrocious rights. The mistress of ceremonies, in black, is a licensed practitioner of witchcraft. - I summon, stir, and call thee up, ye mighty ones of the north. - [Narrator] 100 years ago in this same house, the elect would have bought the devil's favor by sacrificing a young virgin. First hallowing her with sacred oil before an inverted crucifix, they would have slashed open her throat and her breasts. As her life drained slowly away, they would have danced around her body and each male disciple in turn would perform a final abomination on her purity. Today, all of this has been stopped. The only blood comes from a beheaded chicken held dripping over the girl's body and the only form of assault permitted is to lay hands symbolically on the sacrifice. Mephistopheles is served by gesture only in the 20th centuries so highly enlightened society. The benediction of the towering Christ high up on the Corcovado seems to bless the entire fantastic bay of Rio De Janeiro. This extraordinary city lives and vibrates with a rhythm which is in the air, in the rippling colors of the pavement, in the supple movement of its inhabitants. A rhythm which accompanies the Brazilian like a steady theme from his first to his last step. A rhythm of samba which can be found even in the formidable, yet graceful dribbling of Pele, the pride of Brazil. Pele, the greatest individual soccer player in the history of the game. A player whose speed, rhythm and magic feet have been protected by law as if they were the most priceless of masterpieces. Brazil has passed a statute forbidding him to play soccer for any other nation. From the slums and the hills, singing natives descend toward Rio Grande for Copacabana. They are intoxicated with joy, free and happy, an intoxication which lasts for the four delirious days of the mardi gras in Rio. In Europe, the mardi gras began to decline after the 18th century, but the natives of Rio seem to have stopped it in its moment of glory and taken it for themselves. They dress up in wigs, faces, silks, crinolines, enraptured by the elaborate elegance of the most sophisticated century in European history. Invoking all the gods of pleasure for their four frantic days, until the somber curtain of Ash Wednesday falls across their head. All too soon, the revelry comes to an end and it is a time for holy devotion. A nightclub in Nairobi offers to American and European tourists the tribal dance of the Samburu in its native and authentic form. These are not native girls of the bush, but show girls giving their three a night performances just like those in Paris, London, and Las Vegas. Well-educated, sophisticated, big city women, they will finish their show on their high heels and braziers and sheathed dresses and girdles, and in a few moments they will be enjoying themselves in their own nightclub around the corner. Performing the tribal dances of the new Nairobi in their native and authentic form. 700 miles from Nairobi, we enter the very heart of Africa. The Africa of the great white hunter. The elephant, the lion. An Africa so fierce that only the most intrepid hunters dare to safari through this area. That is, until some enterprising business man built the Treetops Hotel. This is the home of the 20th century safari. The safari of air conditioning and very dry martinis. The idea here is to spend an evening surprising the animals at liberty, to experience without too many risks the thrill of hearing them roar a few feet beyond the veranda. The sound of gunshots has never been heard by the animals in the (speaking in foreign language) reserve, which surrounds this luxury hotel of overstuffed hunters sitting in chairs of the same style. It was here in the remote jungle that the young princess Elizabeth became queen of England. When the news came that the king, her father, had died, a Kakuyu Chieftain was the first official to invest the young woman with her regal titles. Another exhibition of nature in the raw. In Reno, Nevada, a town not altogether unknown for gambling and divorces, we find the ex-housewife's answer to burlesque. They're extremely fragile, these muscle boys. It is a well known fact that their calling is one of austerity and discipline. For example, always bending in the same way, the same arm, the same finger, hour upon hour, day after day. These castles of enormous biceps, built up through years of constant exercise, will go to pieces unless certain strict conditions are observed, a balanced diet, plenty of rest, early hours, no alcohol, no tobacco, or for that matter, anything else. ''It's hard to see'' ''I live my life without love'' ''The romance ends when the balcony bends'' ''I'm an iron girl in a velvet glove'' ''I need a man'' In a men's bar in San Francisco, we learn that brute strength and bulging biceps are not the exclusive monopoly of the male. ''I've done it again'' ''Look, no fingers'' ''Though I like to kiss and cuddle'' ''I think twice before I struggle'' ''What a dreadful situation to be in'' ''Must admit to the varying races'' '''Cause if I should slap their faces'' ''Richard or Joe, I must go slow'' ''Be cool, sophisticated'' ''Mr. Six foot three, no good to me'' ''With his shoulder dislocated'' ''When the tire goes flat on a moonlight hill'' ''He should have a spare but has he?'' ''I'm used as a jack instead of a Jill'' ''I had to lift the chassis'' ''If I am hunted for my fur'' ''Maybe I'll howl and maybe I'll purr'' ''Just an iron girl in a velvet glove'' Where Europe ends and the ocean begins, we find Portugal, a tranquil almost forgotten land. The song of Portugal is called the Fado which means fate. It is the music of Saudade, the indefinable Portuguese melancholy borne mainly from their abandon to a destiny which must be fulfilled but which may long grow void. Their destiny is generally met on the sea, dark, prodigious force, loved and feared, from which these people live and often die. It was still night when the first fishermen set out in search of whales. The only weapons, courage and handheld harpoons. This small village off the coast of Portugal is the last place in the world where whales are hunted by hand in small rowboats. No harpoon guns, or harpoons with explosive heads are used. These Portuguese hunt the whales in the rank and sometimes foolhardy manner of times past. 60 feet of length and 15 tons of blind fury, a blow from the beast's tail sufficient to destroy both boat and fishermen. The struggle with these monsters of the deep is bloody, uncertain and fierce. Almost a savage greeter of the sea, whose arena is the infinite and whose only spectator is God. Throughout the world, whale hunting is a lucrative profit making business. Each whale represents many dollars, but to these simple people, the whale is not an asset in a ledger book. but a communal way of life. The entire village will share in the catch. The blubber will make oil for the lamps, fat for the cooking, soap for bathing. The tongue, the liver and the steaks will feed the villagers for many days. The skin and bones will make furniture, boots, tools, and jewelry. In the final accounting, the only profit will be survival. Sweden, a land without the warmth of Portugal. Cold, somber, but prosperous. I You know that the rose would die I I If the summer sky were through the sun I Swedish teddy boys are called raggare. Toward evening, the main street in Stockholm is filled with automobiles blinking their lights, the accepted signal for girls looking for a pick up. ''You know that for me to live'' ''All the love you give must be mine alone'' ''For you are the sun to me'' ''And I have to be close to you'' ''You know that if we should part'' ''How my aching heart like the rose would die'' ''Don't go'' ''There can never be someone else for me'' ''If you go...'' ''I'm gonna sing my song'' ''It won't take long'' ''We're gonna do the twist and it goes like this'' ''Come on, let's twist again'' ''Like we did last summer, yeah'' ''Let's twist again'' ''Like we did last year'' ''Let's twist again'' ''Twisting time is here'' ''Around and round and up and down we go again'' ''Oh baby, make me numb, you love me so again'' ''Twist again like we did last summer'' ''Who's that flying up there'' ''Is it a bird?'' ''Twist again, like we did last summer'' ''Come on, let's twist again like we did last year'' ''Do you remember when things were really humming'' ''Come on, let's twist again'' ''Twisting time is here'' ''Around and round and up and down we go again'' Sweden, a land virtually without problems by western standards, without political conflict or organized crime, enjoying the highest living standard known to man. Why, then, does it have the highest teenage alcoholism and suicide rates in the western world? Violent without reason, reckless without enthusiasm, sensual without want. The life of the raggare has no promise. Why, in a country immersed in a prosperity that might be considered opulent, does there exist a ferment of rebellion so blind and senseless? Perhaps it sits everything in this world must be paid for. The tranquility of the greater number must be fatally compensated by the anguish of a few. There is a somber shadow of despair in the faces of these youngsters, the most frightening kind of despair, that which derides everything, even human pity. This is Osaka, Japan. A modern city in the center of one of the most powerful industrial areas in the world. We have been attracted here by an unusual night that has survived, mysterious and ancient, among the neon and smokestacks. It is February the 13th by the lunar calendar and as it has on this date every year for over five centuries, the festival of Saidachi is about to begin. Observe these views with a purpose. On this night, a dozen or more of these boys will die, crushed and trampled to death by their friends. The boys are dividing into teams with one man as the captain. For centuries these boys have had here a yearly appointment with luck. This is Saidachi. The ritual stick is thrown into the fray of naked bodies and the boy who retrieves it and returns it to the priest will be blessed with a year of good luck, and happiness which he will share with his teammates. The water is thrown to wet the bodies in order to reduce friction and enable the human snarl to move more easily. This struggle is blind and ruthless. The entanglement of bodies so unrestrained that the mass seems transformed into one huge monster with a thousand tentacles. The steam rising from the bodies actually fogs our camera lens. Oriental religions often speak their own cruel, obscure language of symbols. We must not ask to understand. Let us be content to imagine that this struggle is a mirror of life. (speaking in foreign language) This is a historical document, the final performance of the Grand Guignol theater, a famous Parisian shrine for fans of blood and horror. The farewell performance in this tiny macabre theater, built inside an old abandoned church, is dedicated to Monsieur (speaking in French). Certainly there is no performer better qualified to ring down the curtain for (speaking in French) Has been the featured actor in this theater of mutilation for the past 25 years. He has given literally thousands of performances dedicated to the realistic display of sadism and violence. Here, for more than half a century while blood spurted in cascades from decapitated heads and hacked corpses, the more sensitive members of the audience fainted right and left. The galleries were packed and the money flowed in. Then World War II rolled over Europe and showed people a bloodier truth than the Grand Guignol could produce. True fans grew rarer and rarer. We've been beaten by reality, the master told us. We just could not compete with today's violent society. Fortunately, Parisians lovingly cultivate far different interests. An association has been formed in France for the cult of rotundities, which have always exercised a particular fascination for French artists. It is the illustrious confraternity of the touch fest, touch buttocks. The grand chancellor is the songwriter Léo Campion and the membership contains many celebrated names, artists, writers, actors such as Michel Simon, Jack (indecipherable), Pierre (indecipherable). The confraternity holds its meetings at the (speaking in French), a restaurant in Montmartre. It has ambassadors all over the world, posts in the United States and Canada are presently vacant. Anyone may be admitted. The new member being initiated here must prove that he can distinguish by touch which of these two rotundities is male. Both rotundities are female, but losing will not be held against him and he will still be allowed to take the oath of membership. After all, these are friendly gatherings devoted to satire and (indecipherable)good fun, and it would be unkind and un—French to deny anyone the pleasures of touch fest which boasts typically gallic and youthful boisterous good nature and retains a healthy fundamental innocence. They eat, drink, and laugh heartily, and once a year elect their queen. Here on the other hand is the Paris that works all night. Not the laborers of love in the (speaking in French) But the workers in (speaking in French), the enormous old city market in the belly of Paris dear to (speaking in French). This huge market has existed virtually without change for centuries. The screaming harangue of the merchants never ceases. All night, every night, and into the morning they shout the praises of their wares. Buy here. Too high, not fresh, too green, too hard, too soft. Buy here. All the gastric rumblings of the gallic national stomach. Virtually every edible item consumed in the whole of France, regardless of its origin or destination passes through this one huge market. The work of feeding the French never ceases, or almost never ceases. Like his American counterpart, the French worker must have his coffee break. In the fine French tradition, this coffee break becomes the cognac break with just a little something extra. Unlike the Americans, the little something is not a donut. In Europe, women are still considered the fairer sex, to be pampered and protected, but in Los Angeles, California, at the roller derby, we view femininity in quite another light. The rules to this ladylike sport are really quite simple. Everything and anything goes. Back in Paris, a far more serious group gathers to watch a demonstration prepared specifically for the cynical press and medical society of the great city. This is Ivan Ivar, a Frenchmen who does not want to be considered a fakir or faker. (speaking in French) My name is Ivan Ivar. I declare that the psyche can completely dominate the physical body. Since I decided to transmit this message to the world, I have become the apostle of the will. The will is all powerful and I am the living proof of this. The rapier, after passing through the grand oblique muscle of the abdomen penetrates close to the liver. It is now grazing the colon and will come out after passing through the base of the dorsal muscle. The mysterious power is extended to his capillary blood vessels which he can cause to contract so that lacerations of his flesh will not bleed. Now the complete perforation of the frontal area of the throat. First, I avoid the external right jugular vein. Next, I must bypass the right carotid. Then I come to the larynx, which I must also clear because of the rigidity of its material. I have reached the second carotid, which I must absolutely avoid on pain of death. After the second carotid, which I have bypassed, thus avoiding all danger, I find the second external jugular vein. The point is about to issue beneath the maxillary muscle. Beyond the arctic circle in Lapland, the summer sun shines for weeks, night and day. It is during this long day that the reindeer are driven from the trackless wastes and crags of this frozen volcanic land and herded into the yearly round up. There as in the great cattle drives of the old American west, the reindeer will be divided among their oldest. Some will be killed and skinned. Others will be branded and castrated. As with cattle, this castration creates steers which produce the fatter, more tender cut of meat. Following an old tradition, this operation will be performed by the women. The round up is a rendezvous for nomadic tribes, a market for the rollicking festival during which young Laplanders choose their brides. All year, these young men have watched, weighed and considered, before picking their brides. And now, with the casting of a lasso, the marriage ceremony is completed. There's no more to be done. In the eyes of the elders, the knot has been tied. With the sinless serenity of the forces of nature, the vital energies of these people explode after being too long numbed by the ice of their endless winter. Paris, you city which cannot sleep at night. Paris, all your lights bore me. It is in your streets that my heart was opened to joy. Though you scorn me, revile me, torment me, I cannot leave. Paris, you have broken my heart. Regrets and melancholy, bitterness and rancor for the Seductions and cruel disillusionments of the great metropolis. This is the reproach (speaking in French) Sings to her city. These gauchos of Argentina are viewing with rapture a far more natural performance. Maria Soriano. The most popular singing star in Argentina. A dainty, almost ethereal essence of femininity. As he races through the morning without realizing it, the boy's carrying a life which will spring anonymous and unnatural from a test tube. The last act of an artificial insemination is about to be carried out. Today, there are many thousands of test tube children in the world. Exeter, England is perhaps the most famous center for this type of operation. For reasons more closely bound to the mystery which has surrounded the act of reproduction through the ages than to authentic scientific necessity, the operation is preferably performed at the first light of dawn. Although the identity of the donor is kept entirely secret, a fantastic amount of research goes into determining the proper genetic match. The woman's husband has been duplicated in the donor as completely as possible. His national background, his height, weight, coloring of eyes and hair, educational background. All known characteristics have been considered so that genetically, the scientific union will be as close to the natural union of husband and wife as medicine is able to bring it. Some women are unable to reconcile themselves to the renunciation of motherhood, but there is a sense of sadness, almost of horror connected with this operation, so that one understands the prudent decision which virtually prohibits artificial insemination in many countries. Women in Rome from whom the blessing of motherhood has been withheld turn to a very different source for help. An old Roman tradition holds that the miraculous bambino in the church of the (speaking in foreign language), a jewel encrusted statue of the child Jesus, will grant the precious gift of maternity to women who climb the steep stairway to the church on their knees. Someday, the child this woman prays to bear may ask her how am I to understand the world? Hopefully she will say to him ecco, look about you. Ecco, observe the passions of men and examine their dreams. Watch for ugliness. It exists in greater variety than you want to imagine. Witness the power of will over flesh. See all you can see of nature, grace, hope and beauty. Ecco, behold the faith that lifts some men to mountaintops, and the pride that drives others to destruction. For there are more things in heaven and earth, and between sunset and dawn, than are dreamt of in our philosophy.
