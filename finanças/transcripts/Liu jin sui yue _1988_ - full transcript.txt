Miss chu in fact works at the metropolitan what is the metropolitan? It's a night club are you saying that so so is a hostess? How do you know? Did you go to the nightclub? Did you see it with your own eyes? Your dad saw her there when socializing with his friends it's so dark there, maybe he mistook her for someone else how could it be a mistake? Miss chu lived here a long time I don't believe it so what if it is true maybe you can persuade her to quit what should I say? I can't help her mom, don't tell me what to do with so so you'd better talk to dad if there is no hostess in the night club with whom will he dance with? What are you saying? I am saying I don't care if so so is a hostess - You look so beautiful tonight - Am 1? Let's go and have something to eat I want to eat Japanese food fine, how about Sushi?

Thriftiness is a virtue - yes I couldn't find Mrs. sze-to I can buy new clothes easily just one show in the club and... I can buy up an entire boutique what should we do about this dress? It's easy, widen up the shoulders put a big diamond brooch here a big diamond broach? That means costume jewelry no way, Fanny never wears anything fake it would be so condescending Fanny, costume jewelry is all the rage in Europe no one will criticize they'll only say you're a fashion leader ok, whatever you say Nancy, I hope you can be on your own and... I'll be your first customer you have ideas Fanny, Mrs. sze-to is ready for the mahjong miss Lee, please excuse me for a minute hello what did you say to Fanny? I heard it all this is a big company your design department is only a small part of it no individualism is allowed everything for the benefit of the company, out! How about the 10 complimentary tickets? I forgot to ask her Mr. chen gets upset when you chat with the clients he is afraid you will take away his customers it's all right, he's the boss and has his own problem I really can't stand his behavior why are so many people lining up here? Buying flats under construction. It's very popular now dad, are you also in the queue? No, I'm just standing in for my friend uncle, you're so far behind your friend won't get a good deal it's not my concern dad, can I stand here with you for a while? No thanks. Tell mom I'll be home for supper all right. Goodbye that Chang is just too much. He is a fair-weather friend I asked for a favor and he said everything had to be done by the book I even have to stand in the line myself he has at least 300 flats of orient garden he wouldn't even let me buy one from him you call that a friend? Must your friends do you favors? Are you still siding with him? I should have you studied architecture instead of fashion design Nancy, so so sent you a dress and left her new phone number. I put it next to the phone don't be in such a hurry. Call her after supper I'll make the call first I told you not to associate with her. She's a bad influence you didn't feel that way when she gave you a suit if she gave me an orient garden unit I'd say she was competent so so? It is me why are you home so late? Moving again? Great environment I designed it myself. All the furniture's from Europe isn't it beautiful? Fantastic. You paid for it? It is a gift such great deal don't be silly, of cause it is not that simple boyfriend? Just a minute Oh, it is you! Of cause I am here, where else could I be? Someone is with me whom? Come and find out my classmate she wants to buy a unit in orient garden so so just forget it if you have to think somebody's coming to meet you So so Chocolate, for you so so what are you going to wear for tonight's party?

He came especially to meet you Sorry our graduates' personal data is confidential we can't fulfill your request good morning, mom good morning sit down and eat slowly I don't have time to eat. Goodbye all right, I will. Goodbye - Nancy, are you going to work? - Yes Mr. Chang never expected that I would deal with Mr. li directly Mr. li doesn't even require down payment just my signature I'll make a profit in a week really capable, I have to admit do you mean Mr. li or miss chu? Nancy, is so so a good friend of Mr. li? I used to buy you lunch-boxes now you come to have lunch with me in central I heard that your father made a lot of money in real estate he's about to become a property agent whoever wants to buy Mr. li's flats will have to go through him warn him a balloon will burst when it reaches high I will tell him that Mr. li treats you so well why don't you learn business from him? It takes too much energy and I am too lazy anyway, I have never taken a penny from him he taught me how to invest and I earned the money myself don't you have a boyfriend yet? Glad I did not compete with you compete for what? Compete who will be a virgin longer I will definitely lose how do you know I am a virgin? Don't you like men? Of course I do. Just haven't found the right one what about you?

You are so coquettish Sung ga ming I'm Nancy chiang it's you. I hardly recognized you why are you here? Why didn't you two ever call me? It's a long story. Let's talk over a drink fine! Haven't seen you for so long your mandarin has improved a lot didn't you say if I couldn't speak mandarin well you wouldn't see me again? You have a good memory how is chu so so? Is she all right? She lives in saikung... And works in finance she's an unforgettable girl I had that feeling even when I first saw her I just had lunch with her. She's gone now sometimes she has those boyish charm and sometimes she is gentle... And feminine what are you doing now? I am now a journalist it's just that I've never seen anybody like her I always think about the moment I met her and always think... How lucky I have met you wouldn't it be wonderful if the three of us could go to ocean park together again that is possible so so is leaving for Europe tonight we can meet when she is back Suddenly I hate myself why did I tell a lie? So so is in fact is in Hong Kong I could have asked her to come and spend time together why didn't I do that? I feel I took something away from so so yes, it's an opportunity but what would it matter to her in this days? Miss chiang - Mr. li - is so so home? - Yes she is by the shore I'm going down to see her miss chiang, I have something to tell you yes You are the only one so so is close to yes she is getting married congratulations to you it could never be her and myself who is she going to marry? Let her tell you herself don't you think it is ridiculous? A rich old man falling for a little girl don't talk that way I never thought of it like that I only know that you are good to so so and even to her friends she is fortunate I am like a father to her tell her I'll take care of her Mr. li miss chiang and you care of her for me miss chiang, the sino-British negotiations are about to begin tell your father to sell all his stock and property so so is waiting for you down there Philip Take a sip they are my company's secretaries, Mimi and gigi my friend Nancy, this is Philip is the picnic prepared?

I saw somebody who looked like him all of a sudden I felt something I haven't forgotten about him after so many years in fact, we didn't know each other too well do you want to see him? I don't think so, it was so long ago next week is your birthday let's spend it together I made $30,000 again this month mom, how about us going to Taiwan next month? Taiwan and not Europe? Dad, mom you dress up so beautiful tonight when you're in the fashion business, you should dress up everyday where are you going to? She's grown up now. We have no part in her birthday celebration dad, Mr. li said that you should sell your flats now? Are you sure? Is there something wrong? What could be the trouble? Property prices are rising everyday. It's an excellent situation it's only the rich who are overly cautious what did miss chu say? Mr. li told me personally nothing to do with so so I'm leaving now Time to take the medicine so soon? You know your heart problem well take the medicine now and calculate later does Nancy have an appointment with so so? No, a man has just called to ask her out for supper - is that so? - Yes she is a big girl now and must go out for a date it's almost done, be patient don't move!

I planned to have supper with her give this present to her for me thank you why don't you stay here for supper since Nancy's out, I better go goodbye - goodbye - come to see us when you have time - All right why didn't you tell her Nancy went out with her boyfriend? Nancy's a big girl it's up to her to tell others about her private life - happy birthday! - Thank you This is for you Do you still remember ocean park? This was the picture of the three of us taken that day sorry I haven't had the opportunity to give it to you we were so young back then it wasn't that long ago five years is a long time. We've all changed a lot strange enough, I've always kept this picture like I knew I would meet you two again Why do you always say "you two" because I've always felt you two were one entity I thought she would come tonight I want to be myself that's not what I meant what I meant was that... This picture has been with me so many years seeing you in the picture naturally reminds of her see if she still recognizes me see if she still has the same expression as when she knocked me down because of this picture you two have always been in my mind chu so so is getting married Chu so so is getting married you have already said that why is your reaction so calm? We have no reason to stop her from getting married Smile! I've never seen such an unhappy bride what a paradox. I don't know why I marry I have never been in love so I marry someone rich if you find our love now will you still go on this marriage? I have been through everything by now marriage is like a contract once signed there should be no regret you haven't signed it yet a promise is like a signature but life is not a trade sorry, but I feel so perplexed I've brought a friend to see you do I have other friends? Aren't you my only friend? There is one more so so I leave you alone for a while It's you All these years, I tried to imagine you in a wedding gown I never thought you'd be wearing one so soon why is your mandarin so good? Didn't Nancy tell you? I'm now working in Hong Kong so I have to speak fluent mandarin Nancy didn't tell me maybe she wanted to surprise me my wedding day is next month, will you come? I might have to go back to Japan in a little while are you free tonight? I want to take you out for supper thanks, but I'm not free perhaps we fix a date for three of us as a celebration for you don't bother. Thank you I won't have time I finally met so so again although she was no longer 17 although I didn't feel that she was happy she still retained her charms she did not say much there was a nameless sorrow in her eyes [t made me want to understand her better and protect her It's me Is madam at home? Thank you I'm sung ga ming this is a recording, I'm out now - Miss chiang - Is madam at home? She is not in - please give this to her - Alright do you remember I once said I would write a story about you two since our reunion I've written half the story. Take a look that means Nancy and I have become legends? Did you have a fitting for your wedding gown? How was it? It's been a long time since I've felt so healthy getting up early in the morning isn't it lovely? Beautiful are you very happy now? You have everything boyfriend, beautiful house, and a fiancee now if I want to see you I have to wait in line Nancy, what's wrong what's wrong? I get up every morning at 7 o'clock and hurry to work I almost work myself to death, and what do I get? You don't have to do a thing, yet you have everything it's so unfair Nancy I've never heard you say you don't like your job I like this job I'm upset that my life is not as colorful as yours Nancy, are you jealous of ka ming and me? Me jealous of you? Ridiculous! You're so happy you've gone crazy saying things like that... If I were jealous, I would not have brought him to see you I know you don't have a boyfriend not having a boyfriend means I have to like sung ga ming? If I wanted, I could have lots of boyfriends Sure, lots and lots sorry, I 'll invite you for dinner as my apology it was my fault sorry, I'm confused I know Don't tell me you want me to move here it's not my style I can't tell you yet. Let's move on Auntie it's you, so so! Auntie so so! I've looked for you for years. I miss you - I have a lot to tell you - So so you are more and more beautiful I've missed you, too so so! Ga ming, how did you find my aunt? Have you forgotten that I am a journalist? Because of a deadlock in the British-sino negotiations the stock exchange and property market have dropped severely why did it fall like that? What can drop has dropped, I am in big trouble why are you losing your temper you don't look good, it's time to take medicine stop fussing! Hello, who is it? Mr. Chang, real estate has dropped severely. What do we do? I owe the bank several million what? Hang seng index is dropping and how about my stocks? What about my other investments... Just a minute Are you awake? Do you want some soup? Doctor said you've overworked, nothing serious your dad's death certificate has been issued I have arranged everything for the funeral rest up for a day or two still a lot of minor things to take care of you are getting married and still come here? You and I are too close for that I've taken care of your father's flats and stocks when the price rises you can pay me back with interest so so what? I am so sorry silly, you didn't do anything bad I was jealous of you when you were so happy I was wrong too if I had paid more attention to you things wouldn't have happened this way I was too selfish How is ga ming? He is going back to Japan what are you thinking? Nothing just hoping you'll be happy I will I am leaving take a good rest When are you leaving? Wednesday That's my wedding day. It's better if you don't come I won't be so sad ga ming, I'm grateful to you you helped me find my aunt you helped me find what I had lost this month has been my happiest ever when I first saw you you were very happy since then I wished that I could always make you happy but I failed You never request my happiness even if I had, could you offer? But I believe I'll finish writing the story of you two Will you return here? Not for a while Shall we keep in touch? Of course it's getting late. I have to go Give it to me as a souvenir Please don't so so, I love you, I really do I wish I could say the same but... I have to go "Gone were those golden days" "how one wishes to keep the past" "to meet in that rain of golden light" "and talk about innocent days" "from a clear sun rise" "No matter whether love had its chance" "one still wanders in circles" "vanishes in dreams, and never stops longing" "gone were those golden days" "how one wishes to keep the past" "the heart still longs with a sigh" "still wishes to keep the days gone by" "only a speechless you and I" "can taste the bitter and sweet of the past" "once upon a time I saw a blurred face" "now is a face etched with sorrow" "When they were twenty-seven" young kids we are back to this beach if you had to choose one among the boys who would it be? None of them suits me sorry. Thanks have you noticed that our charm and glamour have no comparison to a volley ball time flies we're 27 and on the verge of becoming old ladies Nancy, you are not old not old? I know it even if my colleagues don't say so one day in the office I heard them talking in slang it was like hearing Russian, didn't understand it at all and the other day... I was shocked by a colleague's profanity what used to be foul language... Is now a common phrase you're making a name for yourself in the fashion world I stay at home and have lost touch with the world do you remember we used to come here to watch the boys? How come they weren't so sexy then today's younger generation is very capable they know exactly who they are and what they want there is a new boy in our company he just graduated from the states and helps me on the design he doesn't take me as his boss and keeps on sending me gifts I don't know how to handle this where are the flowers from? From me of course he's so gutsy, one time he even asked me do you know what you don't have? Nothing. I have it all there is something that you don't have what? I'm giving it to you "Education of love" take him then no, I don't like him love is complicated when you like him, he doesn't like you when he likes you, you don't like him and when two people like each other, then... You're so moody, are you unhappy? I constantly tell myself to respect the marriage but living with Phillip has made me very unhappy what could make you happy? Divorce but I am use to this kind of lifestyle how could I have the courage to get divorced? The rich have their own problems what can one do to be happy? I want to go places where? Paris, London, Tokyo Tokyo "Tokyo" Do you know where so so is? No, I don't fin her fast and tell her to file for divorce why? Hsieh's freight company is about to close down it has nothing to do with her. Let the company handle it miss chiang, you are so naive the company's guarantors will be held responsible for the debts the American bank is preparing to file a lawsuit next week is it that serious? She won't get a thing from the hsieh family tell her getting a divorce is for her own good I'll find her and tell her immediately how much do they owe? Us$824 million half of it is mine Is chu so so back? Thanks Nancy, I have a present for you why you always give me things? Today is your birthday how do you know? See if you like it thank you What's wrong? Nothing I'm just thinking of a friend So so he even wants to climb mount fuji I said the Autumn was too cold and I had to rush back to see you might as well wait till your holiday... And we can go together I've already asked the company to send me back to Hong Kong then I'll keep an eye on you two thank you very much you better find someone for Nancy she is so wasted for all the years I've known her she's never had a boyfriend wouldn't you say she's a bit up-tight? It's so hard to believe we've already known each other for 10 years Nancy, your birthday seems to be this month let's celebrate together where do you want to eat? It's ga ming's treat Nancy, so so will arrange it for you I have to call the newspaper office Are you in love? Does it show? I know what I want now I just want to be happy miss chu, don't you recognize me? I'm tseng, Mr. li's former assistant we've met many times I bought Mr. li's company here's my business card miss chiang if your father wants to buy property just give me a call. Goodbye he is mad. Don't pay any attention I want to divorce Philip. I'll agree to any conditions what's most important is to be free did you say you have something urgent? Since you're getting a divorce, then it's all right Nancy I waited for you but now have to go I've reserved you tickets for my concert - best seats in the house - Thanks! And you did a great job restyling my clothes nobody will notice they're old and I am doing the best PR for you personally don't forget to come to my concert! Bye-bye goodbye dress up a little! Restyling my foot! She shouldn't come... If she can't afford new ones I don't understand why she doesn't retire already no way an oldie like her could make a comeback nobody buys her records neither what are you talking about? She's our customer, not someone to gossip about are you doing any better? Mind your own business first Nancy - don't come in! The sample is ready put it down get out! Nancy, don't drink too much Have you fallen for me? Did you ever think you would have me? Are you afraid of me because of I am your boss Do you want me? I am sorry I should not act like this I took you for somebody else You will not remember what happened tonight? Why should 1? Nancy, give me a smile Do you know what... I wanted most when I was a child? Someone who'd care for you forever how did you know? Every child wants that when I was 17 I knew so so would care for me forever but that wasn't enough I wanted ga ming, too somebody who would love me forever the more I wanted him the bigger the pressure. I felt lonely In the end, I didn't even have a friend to share my secrets That's why I am grateful to you the things I did not dare to tell people I could tell them all to you I don't think I'll ever do this again but tonight, when I needed it most you came to comfort me really, I am truly grateful to you Chih Cheng You'll be all right hsieh's freight company... Has been affected by the worldwide shipping decline hsieh's stock price was at market bottom yesterday the company's stocks... And bonds ceased trading today this room should be big enough to be your walk-in closet I plan to put a dining table here a sofa over there, and... Ga ming remember when you took me to see auntie... What I said then? You said that you were grateful to me I said I wasn't used to living in such a place you're joking, right? I am serious you know hsieh's freight is bankrupt in a few days I'll have lost everything you still have me that's not enough... You know what kind of life I was accustomed to? I know, but I love you that's not reason enough but you once said that if only we could be together you could give up everything it's a casual talk but I know you meant it maybe I did mean it when I was wealthy but soon I'll have nothing I only know I can't give up my style of life ga ming, we are not the same I only know love can make up for everything love is not my priority my promise to you was made in the heat of the moment but now I must face a practical problem of my life style can you afford me? How much can you afford my clothes... And expenses? I suppose I could put up with you for a little while but not for my whole life. I couldn't your monthly pay isn't enough to buy me one dress I am used to luxury and you can't change me but we can start afresh don't be so naive, do you think I am still 17? Sung ga ming I really can't live here. I have to go chu so so you always come and go as you please I've never uttered even a word of complaint don't you know I also have feelings don't you know... How sad I am every time you leave you said you loved me... And I've never doubted your sincerity but I never thought your passion would cool down so fast I never thought that money was so important to you so important that even your love could be bought every time you said you loved me... And then left because of money what do you take me for? You would do anything for money, wouldn't you? What do you take yourself for? Ga ming has gone he's really gone how could it be like this? You two were so close what affect did hsieh's bankruptcy have on you two? You wouldn't understand, nor would he tell me I told him... I did not love him anymore I couldn't give up my lifestyle I don't believe it. You're not that kind of person I have lost everything over night but somebody has lost even more than I I only lost the luxuries of life but he lost his reputation and status I can start all over again but he is too old so so, forget it the hsieh family was never too nice to you. Don't be so sad I didn't mean the hsieh family it's li li chih Cheng? You know how good he was to me... And to your family he still took care of me... After I married into the hsieh family he bought half the hsieh stock... To protect my position in the family The other night I went to see him he had aged so much overnight I feel so very sad did li chih Cheng go bankrupt? Not bankrupt but he needs a large cash flow a very huge amount of capital I know tseng would be able to help him I went to beg him and he agreed but I have to be with him I said yes, but not in Hong Kong how could you say yes? Nancy we're still young, we can start all over again chih Cheng is old. This is too important to him Does ga ming know about it? He only knows love and that I don't love him but he is the only person I love in my life I know - I let him down don't say that Don't You misunderstood so so So so Nancy So so, stay here, don't go! I am very happy that you two are here please stay I've been like a bird flying here and there, never stopping then I met you. I thought I could finally settle down I never expected I'd have to leave again ga ming don't let me hesitate Nancy, I am grateful to you So so so so Nancy is waiting for you "Gone were those golden days" "how one wishes to keep the past" "to meet in that rain of golden light" "and talk about innocent days" "from a clear sun rise" "No matter whether love had its chance" "one still wanders in circles" "vanishes in dreams, and never stops longing"
