- Hi, I'm filmmaker Chip Rossetti. What you're about to see is real actual footage that we came across and we put together to tell the story. As disturbing as it may seem, this is a true story. There have been countless attempts to hide and destroy this footage, but none of them have been successful. I ask that you keep an open mind in that what you're about to see has never been seen publicly before. I also ask that you determine for yourself what happened. Because this situation is still being investigated. And I also wanna reiterate one last thing, this is not a typical Christmas movie as we know it. This is not a professionally shot, scripted Christmas movie. This was compiled and put together from hours and hours and hours of footage that one day just showed up on our doorstep. And we felt inclined to tell this story. So enjoy Discarding Santa. Thank you. - Okay, I'd like to go ahead and call this meeting to order. I need a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting dated September the 25th, 2010. - Motion to approve. - Second. - All in favor? Aye. - Any opposed? Motions carries, minutes approved. I believe Councilman Mudd has the first topic of today's agenda. - I do, thank you Mayor. Alright, the first item on the floor today is the proposed Ordinance to eliminate all references to Santa Claus and Christmas. Now, this is a city wide attempt to decommercialize the season. - You're joking right? Can't have anything associated with Santa? Can't say anything about Santa? I'm just trying to understand, what you are wanting from people. Let's just get rid of Christmas trees too, if you want too. I mean, let's just get rid of one and the other, let's get rid of all of it. - We need to stop calling it Christmas and stop referring to Santa Claus. It's a no-brainer. We tell people everyday that they can't talk about God in school. Not everybody believes in God. Folks talk about nativity scenes and, I don't know, any other Christian reference, where you gonna find them at? You're not gonna find 'em here. You're not gonna find 'em on municipal property or public property. Not everybody's Christian. The last, best shot we had of pulling that one off, Constantine was the Emperor. It's been a while. Why is it right to call it Christmas when not everyone celebrates Christmas? It's the Christmas season. - No, it's the holiday season. Holiday season. Nobody should be bothered by that, angered by that. It's almost 2011, nobody should even be surprised about that. It's the right thing to do. - No it's not. - It's the right thing to do. - No. - Mayor can we vote? - Kevin, you're talking about the parking issue right? - No, I'm afraid you probably wish I was talking about the parking issue, but I'm talking about the Ordinance of discarding Santa from the city limits of Leitchfield. - Well I just want you to know what you're talking about. - This is crazy. I'll never vote for you two again. - That's right, seriously. Seriously this is crazy, seriously. - Everyone just calm down, just a second please. Just calm. I need a motion. - I'll make the motion. Guess I'll second. All in favor of eliminating Santa Claus from all public and private property within the city limits signify by saying aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Aye. - Any opposed? - Neigh. - Motion carries. City Ordinance 10 dash 195 passes four to one, effective immediately there will no reference to Santa Claus within Leitchfield city limits for Christmas. - I hope you feel bad about this. - I mean the holiday season, 2010. - This is Cara Anderson with K105 News. Right now, I'm standing outside Leitchfield City Hall where the Council just made an unprecedented ruling. They ruled that there are to be no references to Santa Claus this Christmas season. On private, public and municipal property. - City Ordinance 10 dash 195 passes four to one effectively immediately there will be reference to Santa Claus within Leitchfield city limits for Christmas. - Just moments ago we got to speak to one of the Council members, after the controversial decision was made. As you can see there's still a lot of discussion going on about the most recent Leitchfield City Council meeting. And a lot of the people who attended are pretty upset about the decision that was made today. We're hoping to catch one of the Council members as they exit, to get a word on what went down today. So Councilman, can you please give us a word on the meeting. - Oh yeah, we're just trying to bring Leitchfield into the 21st Century. And this is good Ordinance, it's not gonna hurt anybody. If folks wanna put up their holiday decorations, feel free to do so. Lights and ornaments and, no issues. Just no Santa Claus. - And when will this become effective? - It's effective right now, before I came out here Mayor Henderson signed the Ordinance, so it's official. - Okay, and where there any members of the Council in opposition to this Ordinance? - It's nominal. It passed four to one. - Thank you for your time. - Oh my pleasure. Hey, happy holidays. - Happy holidays to you too. There you have it. I'm Cara Anderson with K105 News. Look, there's nothing we can do about it. I think it's stupid. I think it's been stupid for the past few weeks and I think it's still stupid today. Larry, we've been cruising around here, taking down Santa's for weeks now. And now of all of sudden it's bothering you? Because we're getting closer and closer to Christmas, you see. Ah, look here. Here we go. You're getting pulled over. - What? Are you serious? - What did you do? - What did you? Unit 17. Unit 17, this is Dispatch go ahead. Traffic violation, on the square. Unit 17, 10-4. Did I do something wrong officer? - No, you weren't speeding or anything ma'am. But we need you to remove the Santa out of your back window please. - My Santa? - Yes ma'am, your Santa. If you could just remove it out the back. Jason, you aren't supposed to be saying the name either. - Yeah, if you could just hand the holly, jolly, red doll back there to the officer please. Just take him down and you can be on your way? You guys have gotta be kidding? Take it. - Thank you complying, Merry Christmas. - Thank you. - Jason! I'm sorry, happy holidays. We're not allowed to say Merry Christmas either. - What are you doing? - City Ordinance 10-195. No Santa shall be displayed on private or public property. You see, the police officer right here, remind me of that. - You've gotta be kidding me? - Nope, it's a ticket-able offense, take it down or pay the fine. - Alright, gotta go. Peyton hurry up. Meet you up there! - Hey Peyton, let's see is mom will let us open up some presents. - Remember just this one, you've gotta wait until Christmas for the rest. - I know mom. Come on, hurry up, I wanna open mine. - Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. This is the one I saw at Best Buy. - I know, I wanted you to open it early so we can get some video of Christmas this year. Seriously hurry up. - It has a little bit of charge. - It's my turn, it's my turn, it's my turn. It's a game, it's a game, I love games. Hey mom, this is the best present ever. - Don't point that thing on me, I look like death eating a cracker. You look awesome mom, can I interview you? - What? Hurry, before the battery dies. - Alright. So mom, what do you think about this whole Santa thing in town? - Honey. Seriously, Miss Mudd said that people could, like, get in big trouble because of it. - I don't think it's gonna last honey. It's just another politician's attempt to make their mark on the world. But why Santa? - Because it has to be something. A couple of years ago it was manger scenes and before that it was the Ten Commandments. They won't even let us say one nation under God at the pledge at school. - Well, trying saying one nation under Santa and see what happens. Mom. - Actually on second thought, don't do that. - Thank you so much, you're watching the Christian View. Hey, we talked about Easter. And yeah, we just hit on Halloween, but what about the modern day Santa Claus? Jackie, is this just Satan's way of robbing Jesus Christ of his glory, by spreading, yet another diversion, to get if off Jesus Christ and the birth of Christ? You can't even spell Santa without spelling Satan. - Yeah. - I never saw that before. That is tricky how Satan gets in the middle of things. Amazing isn't it. - But I always say it goes back to the heart, and keeping your family and yourself, focused on the person. I know that Trudy loves to say Jesus is the reason for the season. And it sound trite when we hear it so many times but it's true. And I didn't even realize it 'til what you said. But I always looked at Santa really, as more business propaganda. That it was the Macy's Santa to get business stimulate, stimulated during Christmas. - You know, I think that when you really get to it and we think about Santa, the whole essence of it, it is a trick of Satan. Oh, they're in there already. They're waiting on you to get started. - Alright thanks, appreciate it. - You guys busy today? - No, we've had a couple of alarm calls, a couple of traffic calls, it's not been too bad. - Good, that's what we like. It's what we like. - Sorry sir, busy morning. - It's alright. - Missed your alarm clock? - Alright guys, listen in real quick so we can get of here, and second shift can get started. First thing we wanna talk about, we wanna talk about what everybody's, all the chatter and stuff around town, which is the new City Ordinance that the Council enacted and passed. You guys been doing a great job on that. In three weeks, let's see here. You guys have confiscated 300 Santa's. Yeah, you guys oughta be proud of that. But don't relax. Don't, don't, don't relax on this because with Christmas coming up, I mean the actual holiday, is just a week away. - Do you expect any problems? - No, no, I don't think so. But you know guys, stranger things have happened. Just keep doing what you're doing, and we'll be fine. - With all due respect sir, could we go over again why we're doing this? - Come on Jason, you know why. It's our job, it's our job to enforce the law. - But sir, again with all due respect, there's some of us here that just believes this is silly. - Well, we don't decide the rules, we just enforce the law. That's, that's our job. You know, someone higher up has thought that there's something wrong with Santa. And until, until that's changed we're gonna do our job, and we're gonna do what we're supposed to do. - Yes sir. - And something else guys, I don't ask this very often, but on, or off duty, if you see a Santa, I want you to take care of business and do your job. - Yes sir. Something wrong Cartwright? - Um, no sir, no, no, no. Just, you said Santa three times, and Christmas once. I just thought, you know. You might wanna-- - Oh god. - Guys we're done, let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. - Yes sir. - Hit the streets. - I bet Becky hasn't saying Santa. What would you care anyway? It's the law. - Hi. ♪ Do do do do ♪ Hey honey. I see where they installed the cameras. - Seriously Jason, do we really need this many cameras? They're everywhere, even the bathroom. - This is the best package that they had honey. And after last months break in, I ain't taking any chances. Besides, we can shut the ones off in the bathroom. - Yeah, this may be a bit much. - Bit much? _ Hmm-mm. - Look, when it comes to protecting our family, this is not near enough. - Yeah, well you may think different when you hear what happened at school today. - Oh no, what did he do? - Temporary tattoos. He put Santa tattoos all over his arms and face on the school bus. - God. - Go ahead and laugh. - I'm sorry. - They called me out of work and made me go down to the school. - What did they do? - Made him go into the bathroom and scrub them all off before he could go back to class. - Okay, okay, I'll talk to him, I'll talk to him. He's your boy. Come on get up. - I already know dad, you don't have to say anything. But it was freaking hilarious. - Come on buddy, you know you can't be doing that stuff. - I know, I really just want people to laugh at me. - What about Mr. Mudd? - Oh yeah, he was like freaking out. - Dude, he's on City Council. - This whole Santa thing is really stupid, don't you think? - It doesn't matter what I think DJ, I enforce the law. - Yeah, but like really, what do you think about it? - Well of course I think it's dumb DJ, but you gotta do what you gotta do. - To protect and serve. Yeah, something like that. And listen here mister, one more screw up like that and you are in some deep trouble, you got it? - Yes sir. - Your dad means it DJ. I don't wanna get called down to the school again. - Look mom, I really don't care. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. I know mom, I'm sorry. - I know mom, I'm sorry. - Alright, well dinner's ready. Go get your sister and let's go eat. Jason we've gotta leave in an hour for the party. - Party? What party? - The Whitman's Christmas party. - Oh, that's tonight? - Yes, and no ugly Christmas sweater. - Oh no, no no no, I'm wearing my ugly Christmas sweater. - Jason. - Come on, you make me go to that stupid party every year. I'm wearing my ugly sweater. - Fine, whatever. By the way, I gave Peyton one of her gifts earlier. - Really, which one? Oh hey baby. What you got? - A camera. - Yeah. - Thank you, thank you, thank you for the camera. It was the best Christmas present ever. - Wow, well you're more than welcome. But now, I expect you to take care of it, right? You can handle that? - Absolutely. - Okay cool. So can I ask you a favor? Can I borrow that for the Whitman's party tonight? But daddy I just got it. - I know, and you'll have lots of time to film with it. But I'm just, kind of want to use it, just for a little bit tonight. What do you think? - It's fine. - Okay, thanks. So how do you turn it on and how do you fix it? What do you? You, when you turn it on you flip it this way and then punch that button. - So, if I were to do this we would turn it off. - A small town in Kentucky is making a surprising move concerning Christmas. The City Council in Leitchfield, Kentucky recently voted to ban any and all reference to Santa within its city limits. Anyone in the town who publicly mentions Santa or included images or references to Santa in any decoration or celebration will be subject to a criminal fine. The ban took effect immediately upon passage and the Leitchfield Police Department has already begun to issue citations. Oh there it is. There she is ladies and gentleman, the most beautiful girl in town, if not the entire world. You look beautiful tonight sweetheart. - You just come on. Turn that thing off. - No no no no, I'm gonna capture every bit of this party tonight. I am gonna have a blast with this thing okay. Alright, now listen, me, and the beautiful wife, that's Becky. Okay. We're at the Whitman's 2010 Christmas, holiday get together. And I'm in my super sexy, incredible, fancy, awesome and I daresay handsome sweater and I can't wait to get this thing started. And they're going in without me, okay. - Ladies and gentleman, kids have arrived. With a camera. With a camera. Uh, yeah we thought this would make a great, you know, memory maker. You know, it was Peyton's holiday gift. - Oh that's fine with me, but I can't speak for the others around here. After they get into this eggnog that I made, they're probably not going to appeal to that camera. - Well after I get into it, I may not even be able to hold the camera. - Oh, well that sounds good. Hey, come in in and let me take your coats. - Oh yeah sure. - Yes thank you. - You're very welcome. - Can you get my sleeve sorry? - Well, I'll get his sleeve. - Thanks. Basically, basically. Alright, alright, look at this place, look at this place. Hey guys. - Hey, how are you guys? You all are looking sharp tonight. How you feeling? - It's been a while. - Doing good, doing good. - Doing good. Yeah. How's the drink? - Good to see you again. Good. - Yeah. That's right. Miss Whitman. - Hey there. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Hey good job with the party so far. Thank you. Hey, I brought my beautiful bride with me. - Oh she's gorgeous. - Isn't she? - She is, I know. - Great smile. - Yes. - Beautiful dress, I picked that out. - Uh huh. - There is the husband. - Oh I know. - There's something about him. - My dearest, my dearest. - What are you doing man, I don't know. Mr. Gregg what's up man? - Hey. Damn, how you doing man? I'm doing well, doing well. - Right good. Hey wait, are you gonna actually film this whole thing? The whole time? I'm here filming as much as possible. You know, trying to get into everything. Well what are you doing tonight young lady? - Hey, how are you? Enjoying yourself? - Gonna get in trouble? - Of course not. - Good, good. 'Cause I'm a cop you know, I'll keep an eye on you. I can see how much you're already drinking. Look at that, it's almost down to nothing. - Oh, it's just my third, fourth. Just my, sixth. Oh, so what's going on guys? You all been okay? - Good, you Jason. - Good Jason. - How are you? - Pretty good, pretty good. How do you like the food? - It's amazing. - Yeah, well you know. - It's great, it's legit. - Absolutely, absolutely. - Hey Mary-Ann and Dan sure know how to throw a party. Boy, don't they though. I tell you, this has been gorgeous around here. Definitely. Oh crap. - What, what? - He's got a Santa in the window. City Ordinance, I'm gonna have to take care of this. - Gosh. - Yeah, I know, I know. Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me. Hey Dan, can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah sure, yeah. - Look, I know this is your party and all and I know I'm off duty. But, can we take the Santa down? - Oh come on Jason, don't be ridiculous. - Look man, I can't help it. If Captain O'Reilly comes by and he sees that thing in the window, he's gonna stop in here and he's gonna enforce that Ordinance. - Are you serious? - He's been very serious. And if they guys had come by and they know that I'm here and I didn't enforce it, I could get in some serious trouble. - Come on Jason. - I'm serious. Can you just please take it down? - Alright, alright, I will take down Santa. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Oh, you're not the only one that's armed with one of those video cameras. - Oh really? - Yeah. Rudy brought his this year. - Rudy? - He's armed and dangerous. - Where's he at? Where's he at? - He was last spotted in the kitchen. - What? Oh, in the kitchen okay. - In the kitchen. - Alright. - Loading this Santa. - I am gonna do my best to find him in just a minute. Hey, where'd you get this Santa doll thing? Oh, I've had it for a long time. Really, it's a gorgeous thing. - Thanks. - Old-fashioned and what not. - There. - Alright man, thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - I really appreciate it. You throw the best parties I tell you. Thank you. - Rudy, Rudy what's up man? - Hey, what's going on Jason? Hey, you brought a camera too. - Heck yeah, this is one of Peyton's Christmas presents. I thought I'd bring it here and kind of break it in. - Man, we got two cameras tonight, we can really catch trouble at the Whitman Christmas party. - You know, I have already had to try and avoid it. I had to tell Dan to take his Santa down out of the window in there a while ago. Jason, are you always on duty man? - Look, I just don't wanna get anybody in trouble okay? Did he take it down? - Yeah, he took it down. Hey, I got it all right here on the camera. - Jason. - Yeah. Do you mean that Santa? - Dude, what? - Look man. - Oh man. Dan, man what's the deal? Come on, I told you take that thing down. - What are you talking about? I didn't put anything up. - I just asked you to take that down a while ago. What's it doing back up? - I didn't put it there. I did not put that Santa. Maybe Mary-Ann did? Maybe she thought it fell down and she put it back up? - Okay, whatever, whatever. Can you just please take it down for me? - Yeah. - Just get out the window please. - Alright, I will get rid of Santa. - Alright, thank you, thank you. So, a catastrophe averted. - Yeah. Thank you, now I know it's dumb but I've gotta do my job, okay. - I know, I know. - Alright thanks. Hey Jas, let's get something to eat man. I'm starving. - Hey, that sounds like a good plan right about now. Oh man. - This food looks good. - You are outdoing yourself this year. My goodness gracious, alright. I'll be back in here for that. You have got to be kidding me. - So, are you gonna tell me why we had to leave the party so early? - Okay. So what's the deal with Dan? Huh? Did he wanna get in trouble? Did he wanna get me in trouble? - You said the whole thing is stupid, what's the big deal? - Well the big deal is that I asked him to take Santa down. I watched him take it down, three times Becky. And then what, the minute I walk out of the room it goes right back up. - He said he didn't do it. - Well so did Mary-Ann. So how did it get back up there Becky? It didn't just put itself back up there. Look, I just don't like being lied to and I don't like being patronized. - He's not patronizing you Jason. - I'm going to bed. - Thanks Mark, and I wouldn't exactly call Leitchfield a ghost town, but it certainly is strange to walk the streets and not see a single reference to jolly old Saint Nick anywhere. Not in the windows of the stores, not on the telephone poles. It's just a strange sight. And we've spoken to some of the residents to see what they have to say. - I don't have any problem with it, if different people wanna believe and celebrate different things, and if we can't all agree then there shouldn't be any of it. - I think it's stupid. What difference does it make if someone has a Santa Claus in their yard or store? Yeah, I said it. Santa, Santa, Santa. - I'm gonna have to cite you for what you just said. - The folks of Leitchfield have to be very careful about the things that they're saying this Christmas season. The very mention of the name Santa Claus, let alone a display of him is getting people ticketed and even fined in some cases. Even this reporter isn't immune to the Ordinance. - Hey Cara, how are you? - Hello. We're doing fine, but we're broadcasting right now. - This is uh, I'm gonna have to issue you a citation. - Uh huh. - For what you just said on air. - The reference to-- - Well, the word, the word. - Okay. - You know there's a new City Ordinance and I will cite you for that at this time. - Okay. Well, I guess I'll just pay my fine, just like everybody else who has made the mistake of saying he shall not be named. - It is what it is, the city passed the Ordinance and we're required to enforce it. Some folks have taken this Ordinance to the extreme. Trying to rid their households and yards of jolly old Saint Nick. And some have even been seen taken down their inflatables by stabbing them with knives. - They say he's gotta go, he's gotta go. Nobody's above the law. - There have even been protests in favor of this Ordinance. He he, ho ho. The jolly elf has got to go. He he, ho ho. But not all the residents are in favor of getting rid of, of him. - We've been good all year and now we ain't gonna get nothing. Reporting live from Leitchfield, Kentucky I'm Cara Anderson with K105 News. - Honey? You home? Anybody? Hmm. Shane, I've been giving this a lot of thought. Alright and I know that you've been having a tough time with these cut backs, so I'm gonna make it easier on you. Look, I get it, what are you talking about? I'm resigning it's-- Called at 12 % boss. Well that explains it, 12 %. Hmm, let me rephrase that, 12 % glass. Present? I think you're right, he died in the explosion. You wanna contain the area? No harm in that. What's that now? That's not, what you guys order? Good jobs guys. And I forgot to put my jacket on. So you survive? Yeah, this time. - What the? - Hey man, I'm gonna take off. - Alright, where you going? - Oh my God. - I'm just gonna shower at home And then I've got some stuff to take care of tonight. - Alright see ya. - Hey, happy birthday buddy. - Thanks Marco. - Honey? Does he know of anything I did? - No, at least he better not. - Anyone? - I'll see you there. - Alright. - God. I'll get a towel. Yeah he really wants the blue. He's on 22,000. - What the? How did? That's not a mustery. There's a place I know ordered from manufacturing plants, the coal mine and the-- - Becky! - He actually had four-- - Becky! At one time. Not exactly the greatest clean up ever. It shows Kirk was a loves a vibrant nightlife. Slowly though, on it's way to stiff Michaels. And in a recession it'd be kind of hard to-- And the ones that didn't, they can-- - Hey, where are you? We're at the outlet off Middle Street. - So, you're not here? No, but I'll be there in two minutes is everything okay? - Uh, yeah, I'll, I'll tell you when you get here. See you in five. When the Carter's mine exploded on November 9th 1998. - Cameras, I'm glad I got those cameras. Okay, okay, come on. Come on, come on. Show me something, come on. Come on. Seriously? I'm telling you Larry. I looked at that monitor screen and everything in there was static. Then the kitchen, then the living room. And then, just before I came back in they all came right back on. - You know what I think? - What? - I think you're letting this whole Santa thing get to you just a little bit. - Oh, so now you think I'm crazy? - I didn't say that. You could use a couple of extra days off before next week. - I'm just telling you. If this was happening in your house, you'd be talking to me about it. - I'd be talking to somebody. Good morning guys. Morning Cap. - Morning. - Hey, we got a big day today, ahead of us. And on top of everything else we have scheduled I just got information that the Santa's are ringing the bells and collecting money in their little red buckets again this year in front of the businesses. So, that's probably gonna be top priority. That's what we gotta do today. - We're gonna bust the charity bell ringers. - We not gonna bust them, Murray. It's not busting, it's not busting. We're just gonna take care of business and enforce the law. - Are we seriously gonna do this? - Larry, knock it off. - What? It's ridiculous. - Hey listen, listen, enough, enough. Listen, it's the new City Ordinance, it was passed, we're gonna enforce the law. It's that simple. Just do your job. - Alright. - Alright. - Alright, here's what we'll do. We'll keep it simple and we'll be nice. What I want you to do, is I want you to approach 'em. Tell 'em that you're gonna watch your bucket for 'em, while they go change clothes. They get out of the Santa suits, they come back out in their regular street clothes. They take the bucket from you, they go on about their business. We're not gonna be nasty, we're not gonna write 'em tickets. This is gonna be nice and easy, okay. Nice and easy and professional. - What if they don't wanna do that? - Then we're gonna use whatever means necessary, within reason, within reason. - What do you mean by that? - What he means is no tazing people, Larry. - What are you looking at Larry for? - You're the one who did it last. - That was a long time ago, I was rookie. - Hey hey, listen. - This guy. - Listen. If you have to taze somebody guys, taze 'em. I'm gonna back you. Make sure you're right, because if you're not right I'm not backing you. - Okay. - If you taze them out of stupidity, I'm not backing you. Know that you're right and know that you're justified. Okay. That's simple. It's simple guys. You know, just be nice. I want you to be nice to these people, but we have to enforce it. - Alright. - Okay. - Fair enough. - Alright. Alright guys, dismissed. Hit the street. Yeah? - Captain, I just wanna make sure that it's clear. You said Santa. - Look, look enough. Out of here, come on. - Let's go Larry. - Come on get out of here, get out of here. - Would you back me is I tazed you? - Get out of here, get out of here. Here we go, call it in. Unit 17 to Dispatch, we've got a Santa on the sidewalk of Highway 54. 10-4 Unit 17. - Officers. Santa, it's Santa Claus. - Sir, we're gonna have to ask you to cease and desist. We'll watch your bucket while you go change. - Excuse me? - Ordinance 10-195. No Santa's allowed. - I'm collecting for charity. - And you'll be perfectly capable of doing so wearing normal clothing. - This is a joke right? This is a joke? - No sir, we're extremely serious. City Ordinance. - I'm Santa, collecting for charity. - Yeah, it doesn't matter to us. We're gonna have to haul you in, if you don't comply. - Alright, alright, Jason. - Yeah go ahead. - Hey no, you can't touch that man. What do you think you're doing? - Sir, sir stop. - No, ow, ow. What are you doing to Santa? - Listen, you are now under arrest for assaulting an officer. - Assaulting an officer? Anything you say or do, will be held against you in a court of law. Please stop resisting sir. No, no, no. - Ho, ho, ho. - I said no, no, no. - Can I taze him now? - No, no tazing, put that away. And please sir, stop resisting. - I'm not resisting, you're standing on my foot. Did he say he's gonna taze me? - No, there's no tazing, put that thing away. - Alright look man, you done with the cuffs? - Hold on a second, they're stuck on the Santa suit.

Marty, what's going on here? - I've got no idea boss. - Look, Ordinance 10-195 states that you can't have a Santa. - Can't have a Santa? - Yes, City Council has decided not to have Santa within the city limits this year. You're gonna have to leave. - Mommy does this mean there's not gonna be a Santa this year? Okay, I didn't say there wasn't going to be a Santa, I just said they can't be in the city limits this year, okay. Sir? - Uh uh. The North Pole. Yes I know that Santa's at the North Pole, but this year he can't be within the city limits, okay. Now look sir, either he has to leave or I'm gonna have to give you a fine. - A fine? For what? - For being Santa. I told you, article 10-195 which states that you can't have a Santa. Now sir, please don't cause a bigger scene. I have another Santa already in custody out in the car and I don't wanna have to haul another one off, okay. - What does custody mean? - Oh sweetheart, that means someone's been arrested. He arrested Santa? - I, I-- - You arrested Santa. - No, no I didn't arrest Santa. I just have one out in the car. - But you just said you had him in custody? Yes, I'm bringing him for questioning okay. - For what? - Okay, for being Santa. Sir. Listen, that's enough. Either you get rid of your Santa or I'll shut you down completely. It's your call sir. - Sorry folks, Santa has to get back to the North Pole early to get ready for Christmas. Don't forget to get a lollipop before you leave the store. - Why do they care about Santa? - I don't know. - It's crazy. - Is he serious? Daddy, what are you doing? - Hi baby, what you doing? You enjoying the festival? - Yeah. - Having a good time? - Uh huh. - Well, I'm still in the middle of work, which is really stinky, and I've got more to do. - Well I love you daddy. - I love you honey. I'll be home soon, okay. - Bye. - Hi honey. - Sweetie, what you doing? Just watching DJ. - You having a good time? Yeah, what happened though? - Oh, we'll talk about it when I get to the house. Alright. - Hopefully I'll be home in time for supper. I hope so too. - You got a little psychic with you today? Gracie with us. - That's awfully nice of her. Alright guys I've gotta go. Love you. - Love you daddy. ♪ Really hold me tight ♪ ♪ All the way home I'll be warm ♪ ♪ The fire is delighting ♪ ♪ And the deer was still-- ♪ Alright come on. - No, lower your piece Larry. You ready? What now? Do you know much this cost? - You know what? Take him down. - Come on let's go. - Annie, what's going on here? - Jason's we have Santa's all over the place. Too many to put in the holding cells, so we're just sticking them wherever we can. Every one of these got arrested? That's what it looks like. - Good lord, alright I'll be back. - Come on. - Can you stand for this? - Let me go. - Come on. - Calm down. - This means a lot. - So we brought in 45 Santa's today. Fortunately none of 'em were booked. - Don't you think that's pretty silly Jason? - Well of course I do Becky, but they sign my pay check, what am I gonna do? - Even if it's something you don't believe in. - Yeah. - Daddy. - Hi honey, what are you doing still up? Mommy said that you had a bad day. - Eh, it weren't all that great. But my day gets great when I come home. So I see you're still digging that camera ain't you? Are you kidding? I already had to clear the card four times. - Really? - She taped me dusting for an hour today. - Riveting stuff. Are you excited for Christmas? - You bet honey. - I heard from Leanne, that you arrested Santa today? - I, I didn't arrest Santa. There was just a guy in a Santa suit that I brought in, he got a little rowdy okay. - Oh. - Yeah. - You better get to bed honey. We've got a full day of cookie baking tomorrow and we're starting early. - Nice. - Mommy, I'm scared can you come with me? - I better tuck her in. - Alright, I've gotta get to bed anyway. Gotta be at the station early. - Night. - Love you. - Let's go sleep. - Night baby. Becky! Becky! - This is In The Know for Friday December 24, the 358th day of 2010. There are seven days left in the year. Good morning, MB, guiding you through In The Know at K105. Coming up today we'll look back on a meeting of the Leitchfield City Council, we've got that and whole lot more coming up today here on In The Know. She's the pride of Pumpkin Center, the heiress to the great mini burger fortune, she's Vera Lang's arch nemesis and the professional bargain hunters woman of the year, she's Misty Embry Thomas. Hey. - Hey. - Hey Misty, how are you this morning? - I'm great, how are you Mark? - I'm doing well, it's Christmas Eve, how are things coming along at the Thomas house the day before Christmas? - You know, everything's coming together nicely before the big guy comes down the chimney tonight. - Great, I'm excited. I gotta say though, some people aren't so excited about the big guy. Did you hear that the City Council has passed an Ordinance saying that there're not allowed to be any references to Santa Claus anywhere in town? - Yes I did. You know, and I heard about this a couple of weeks ago and I just thought they were being a little bit crazy. But apparently they're taking this pretty seriously. I wanna show you an amateur video that a listener sent to me of a couple of police officers arresting Santa Claus as he was collecting money for charity. Santa. - Listen, you are now under arrest for assaulting an officer? - Assaulting an officer? - I'm pretty outraged by this Misty. I did some research and here's what I found. Most American's are okay with holiday displays on government property as long as multiple symbols are represented. - Okay Mark, but what symbols? You're gonna have to break this down for me. Where does Santa Claus fit into the Pole? - 44 % say that Santa is okay by himself. But 28 % of people that Santa is only allowed so long as there's at least one other character or symbol included. - What other characters are there for Christmas? - Well like a La Bafana. - Wait a minute, what is a La Bafana? - La Bafana is kind of like Santa Claus in style but she doesn't look like Santa Claus. - Oh, so there's a girl Santa Claus? - She's a witch like character who's become a big part of Yuletide celebrations in Italy. And there are varying back stories but the most popular one is that she was a woman who was kind and gave food to the Wise Men on their way to see the baby Jesus. - Okay, I could get on board with that. - So back to the poll. 20 % of people say there should be no characters displayed on government property of any kind. 8 % were apathetic and they said they really didn't care. But 72 % of US adults said that it was okay to have holiday displays on government property at least in some cases. - 72 is a big number. - It's a big number, but so much for majority rules here in Leitchfield, Kentucky. We've gotta get to a break and then we'll be back with more here on In The Know from K105. - So you woke up in a Santa suit? - Oh shush man. - What in the world do you put in the eggnog? - You too? - What do you expect? - Alright guys. How's it going? - Good. - Alright. Alright well. With everything that happened yesterday, it seems like we've got ourselves in a little bit of hot water. - We were just doing what we were told to do Captain. - I understand that, I know, I know. But guys, videos are everywhere. People are recording us arresting Santa Claus and it's making us look terrible. We're just doing what we're supposed to be doing, I understand that. So, you know, City Hall, they have come up with this brilliant idea that we'll put cameras in every cruiser. So as of today, every cruiser will have a camera. - Did we do something wrong Captain? - Absolutely not. No, this is more for insurance than anything. Plus guys, Christmas Eve coming up, hopefully these cameras will keep anyone else from making us look bad. You know, that's, that's what I'm hoping for. That's, that's what we need. - I think arresting Santa is making us look bad enough sir. - Yeah Jason, I know. But regardless, each car's gonna have a camera. That's what City Hall says, that's what we're gonna do. - Yes sir. - Uh, and here's the thing. I expect the cameras to be on for any altercation, any traffic stop, any time you deal with someone I expect those cameras to be on. - Yes. - And be running. I mean that's just, that's just the way it is guys. We've gotta have it. We've gotta have it. As you leave, pick you up a camera and guys, be safe out there. Yeah Larry. - Sir, you both said Santa. Just wanted to float that out there. - Larry are you serious? Are you serious? - Well I just wanted to make sure. - Are you serious? - A little citation needed to be wrote up. - Really? - What? - Come on guys. Get you, get you, get you camera Larry and let's go. Come on. - Come on Captain. - You said it twice. Christmas and Santa. You want me to give you a citation? - Mom, how do you like Christmas so far momma? - Well, you know, it's a little different this year but, I think we're gonna have a good one. - Yeah. - Did you make your full list for Santa already? - Hmm-mm. - We're not supposed to say that, but don't tell daddy I said that. So, Officer Kemp how does it feel to be on camera all day? - Will you quit mucking around with that thing. It's only supposed to be on when we've got a sighting or something. - Nah. - Come on man, get that out my face. I've got a sighting. - What? - Uh. - No don't answer that. Dispatch to Unit 17, what's your location? - Unit 17 to Dispatch, we are behind Grayson County Middle School. We have another Santa sighting. Suspect is southbound towards the Wilkey Elementary. Unit 17, we are in pursuit. 10-4 Unit 17. Hey hey, look, look. You see that? Unit 17 to Dispatch. We've found suspect entering the side gym door. We've definitely got one. There. Come on. Stop! Oh crap. Stop, give it up. You cannot play Santa. Come on. Stop you. Jason! You're not being very nice. You need to stop in the name of the law. Come on. Alright. Jason? Come on Larry, lose the bike come on. Where'd he go? I don't know. Come on. What? Has anybody seen a Santa? Jason. Okay, a guy in a red suit. He went that way. - He went that way. Oh man. Where'd he go? I don't know, I know he came in here. He couldn't have got away from us, you saw him come in right? Well yeah, I mean it's hard to see from this little lens but I'm sure he came in here. How did he get away from us? I don't know. Unit 17 this is Dispatch, what's your status? - You wanna tell 'em? - Dispatch this is Unit 17, he got away. Well Officer Kemp, how are we gonna explain this-- Unit 1710-4. - I don't know. Put that thing down. What? Freeze. What are you doing? You had your Miranda rights ever read to you? - Of course I have. Come on. What did I do? Impersonating a Santa. Door is locked. - I'll run. - You're not going anywhere. Gonna eat my potato chips. Put 'em down, put 'em down, get out of the bag. Out of the bag. Get in the car. Watch your head. Is this ever gonna end? - I don't know. Come on, come on. Cartwright, go get him in position. I'm gonna go get my recorder. - Come on. - Okay, for the record state your name please. - My name's Shane, ask me again and I'll tell you the same. - So, you wanted to just take us for a run this morning? - Like I said officer, what I told you in the car coming over here. I don't know what you're talking about. - Through the building, down the alley. What, you just wanted to go out for a jog or something? - A jog? I can't jog. I got a bad leg. A war injury. - You seemed to be doing pretty good for yourself out there. - Look officers, look. I'm just walking down the street, stopping at the garbage can to see if there's any cans in there or a little bite to eat maybe. And this fella he come up to me and he offered me $50 to put this outfit here on and go over there and stand by your police car. Now who am I to turn down $50? - You're telling me, a stranger gave you money to put that suit on. - That's right. - Could you describe this guy? - Uh. My memory's not very good. - What would it take to jog it? Maybe some fruitcake? - Fruitcake? Well, it's getting worse now. - How about a sandwich? - Oh, a sandwich. Well my mind's getting a little better now I think. I might be able to if I got a sandwich. - Give it a try. - Alright, let's see. He was dressed in fur from his head to his foot. And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. He had a bag of toys slung over his back. Well he looked like me when I opened my sack. His eyes were awesome and his dimples were merry. And his cheeks were rosy and his nose red like a cherry. His little mouth was drawn up like a bow. And the beard on his chin was as white as snow. He had a black pipe stuck in his teeth and when he smoked, the smoke came out and encircled his face like wreath. - Anything else? - He had a broad face and a round little belly. And when it laughed, it shook like a bowlful of um-- - Jelly? - No, um. - Macaroni and cheese. - No, um. - Spinach dip? - No, no, no. - Cartwright, knock it off. - Jelly, like a bowlful of jelly. - Jelly. - Uh, he was uh, he was a jolly old elf. I kind of laughed when I saw him, I couldn't help myself. - Hmm. - Well that is pretty descriptive. - Oh yeah, and he had a hat. It matched his coat and his pants, and it was red, solid red. - So Mr. Shane do you think you could recount this story for our sketch artist? - Well, I might be able to if you fine gentleman could get me that sandwich that we've been talking about. - Get the man a sandwich, I wanna see the picture. - Alright, be right back. - Hey, well Kemp, what'd you find out? - Nothing, he ain't our guy. - You sure? - He can barely walk. There's no way he led us on a chase through town. - Get any information at all? - Yeah he talked. - Any good leads? - Nothing we didn't already know. Let's just him go. But let him keep the suit, it's gonna be cold tonight. - It's a good idea, good idea. - What's up guys? - What's going on? So I heard the old bearded guy gave you the slip today? - Ah, knock it off Willy. - What, I've gotta know. How does a guy that size wearing that fleece, or was it wool, out run you? - He's a lot quicker than you think. - An old fat guy gave him the slip. - You too Helvey, come on man. - No really, maybe something else was going on. - Like what? - You know, the real thing from the North Pole. Magic. I mean, you're not getting any younger. - Well at least I didn't have to jump on a bicycle in order to catch him. - That's true. Good thing we don't have bike patrol. ♪ He's on, he's on the map ♪ ♪ He's on, he's on the map ♪ Live from Southern California, it's the Chuckie Perez show. - Oh man, hey listen what else has happened, what else has? Oh, oh, I know, I know. Did you hear about this. Leitchfield, Kentucky is banning Santa and any reference to Santa on public or private property. Yep. In fact, police are going around now ticketing people that have Santa displayed anywhere, yeah. I know exactly what you're thinking. 'Cause I was actually thinking the same thing, where the heck is Leitchfield, Kentucky. Exactly, you know. But seriously though, I guess now we know who's gonna be topping the naughty list this year. I mean what's next hunting season on the Easter Bunny? Come on Leitchfield. Hey daddy. - Hi honey. Hey, where's your mom? - Ran into town to get something, said she'd be right back. Hmm-mm, and your brother? - In his room. Merry Christmas Eve daddy. - Merry Christmas Eve to you sweetheart. So what you been doing today? - Help mommy make Christmas cookies and get the rest of the house decorated. Wrapped some presents. - Really, anything for me? - Yeah, but I can't tell you what it is or it won't be a surprise. - Gotcha. So cookies huh? - Yeah we made sugar cookies and decorated them. - Hmm, no Santa cookies huh? - No Santa's. Don't know why we couldn't. All we're gonna do is eat them. - Rules and rules honey, rules are rules. Hey momma. - Hey guys. - Hey babe, what you doing? - I just picked something up from the store. Yeah. - So, I heard something a little crazy today. Good, I could stand some crazy, what you got? - Well, this may not help. But Mrs. Montgomery said she saw you and Larry running full speed chasing a Santa Claus around 8th Street? Yeah. - Then she said she saw you come out, out of breath and how'd she put, Santa-less. - Mrs. Montgomery needs to mind her own business okay. - Seriously Jason? Chasing a Santa around town. I don't remember any of this in your oath when you signed on to the force. - Look, if it isn't me protecting the law from that fleeced jolly guy, who's it gonna be? - It's wool. - What? - Santa's suit is wool. - I didn't know you were an expert on Christmas wear. Anyway, all I wanna do tonight is put on some sweats, sit around and eat some cookies until my gut busts. - Just make sure you leave some for, you know who, when he comes down the chimney tonight. - Yeah, the way things are going, I don't think he's gonna get caught anywhere near Leitchfield. - Yeah. - Well, Santa or no Santa, I've got a feeling this is gonna be a great Christmas. - Me too. You know, they can take Santa out of Christmas, but they can't take the spirit of Santa out of Christmas. You're right. You know, I've got a feeling that they're gonna look back on this and figure out just how ridiculous they actually were. Man, maybe by this time next Christmas it won't be quite so hectic on me. - What do you mean? - Well, because we're chasing the Santa stuff down so much, we're backlogged on everything else back at the Police Department. - That's ridiculous. - It'll make for a busy January, that's for sure. Hey, speaking of, let's check the news. - That's right Misty, we've received several reports of security camera being down all over town tonight. And I guess even on Christmas Eve, there's still no rest for the Leitchfield Police Department. I'm Cara Anderson with K105 News. - Well, at least there's rest for this police officer. - You got that right. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Love you. - Love you. What was that? - What the heck? I don't know. - Mom and dad, I heard a noise. - Yeah, me too honey. - Okay, it's probably just something outside. Go get your brother and get back here real quick, okay. - Okay daddy. - Thank you honey. - Jason, do you think it's a break in? - No, no honey, it's, it's nothing. I'm gonna go outside and check in a minute. I have to deal with this at the Police Station all the time. - What, what is it? - We heard a noise. I think there's somebody in the house. - I didn't hear anything. - There's nobody in the house okay. I'm gonna go out and check. - Be careful honey. - There it is again. It's on but I can't see anything. Turn on the night vision. Does it have that? Ah, just let me see it. Is it on? It is now. - Right DJ, hand your mother the flashlight. It's not working. - Let me see it. Yeah you're right, the batteries are dead. I just put new ones in there. We'll just have to use the camera. I'm going with you. - Alright but go slow. Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me check something. No, alright, come on. Can you see anything in that? A little bit, not much. Here, take the bat and let me have it. Dad, there it is again. Alright, alright, stay close. Hey, what the? What is it? All these Santa's? What? Kids stay close and watch your step. I thought the power was out. It is. Then how's the Santa lit up? I don't know Becky. Mom, what's going on? I have no idea DJ. There it is again. It's upstairs come on. What? Dad, this is dumb. - It's not. - Where did these come from? I've got no idea. Are you seeing these Santa's too? We were just up here. I think Santa's here. Hush. I think a lot of Santa's are here. This doesn't make any sense. DJ, would any of your friends be into, like a practical joke on us or something? No, no. Alright look, let's go downstairs and check the cameras okay. Now be slow, be careful, it's still. Get behind me. What the? Dad, why are there cookies? Where did these come from? What, did you bake those? We didn't bake any Santa cookies. Oh my gosh. - The tree. - Look at that. What? Alright, let's go check the cameras. Here DJ hold this. Well that's money well spent. That's upstairs Jason. - Yeah. Let's go. What? Okay, stay close. It's coming from upstairs Jason. Come on. What? - Daddy, I'm scared. - Scared? Look at all these presents. Where did this come from? - In there. - The presents came from in there? - The noise came from the kitchen, come here. What? There's more stuff. - I didn't bake those cookies. - Well then who did? Alright listen, get behind me. Okay, honey can you get the door? Yeah. - What? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Alright, here DJ, hold the camera. It says to the Kemp family. What's it say? Sometimes the things we can't see are what we should believe in the most. Merry Christmas. Who's it from? Santa. - Whoa! There's a box in the hall. It's got snowflakes on it. Now what? Alright. Okay. - Wait, just one DJ, just one. - I can't believe Peyton fell asleep through all of this - I know. - Another Santa. - Put it with the rest of 'em. - I get to open one present and it's a Santa? We should've waited for Peyton. ♪ Have yourself a merry little Christmas ♪ ♪ Let your heart be light ♪ ♪ From now on your troubles will be out of sight ♪ ♪ Have yourself a merry little Christmas ♪ ♪ Make the Yuletide gay ♪ Hey mom, how are you? I'm good, you know this whole Santa thing, it's been driving me crazy. - Come on Larry! But you know Jason's gotta do his job so. The penalty for this is death. He's really stressed and he's a little bit. - You're not leaving here. - Stop. - Next Christmas maybe. - Slow down, it's over. - I want the kids to have a good Christmas and we certainly know how to-- When we catch up to you. Actual Santa for the city. We'll knock the beard off your face, stop. Taking it as well as I guess, he can take it. - Get back. - I feel so bad. Outside the world is celebrating Christmas and we can't celebrate here in Leitchfield, and I just, I wish they could have a real Christmas, you know. Well, I got them all the gifts they asked for but, I don't know. I kind of wanna sneak a little Santa in there, just for fun. - Get back! - Jason would get mad of course. - Stop. I wish he wouldn't take this whole thing so seriously, I just, wish it were over and done with. - We're going on this. - It's so silly. Oh, more Santa's. Yeah, I guess you've been following the news too. Careful going around these steps. Well, I don't know. I think they're gonna realize soon that this never should have happened. I'm glad to hear that everything's going okay. - Do not do that Santa. - And tell dad, hello and I'll see you in a couple of days. Do not take another step. I'm calling dispatch! I got this camera on me too, I hope Jason doesn't watch this. Yeah, they're everywhere, it's ridiculous. Anyway, I'll let you go, but it's good to talk to you. Love you mom, bye.
