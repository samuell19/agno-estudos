[MUSIC PLAYING] -My lord Cariso, forgive me for being late, but the road is very steep. -Well? -News, Arcanos as you wanted, the man from Athens, I have some. I have some. He is in Syracuse. -We knew that. -But I found out about a meeting where he is to speak tonight, my lord. -Where? -That I don't know. If I question too closely-- but they're already suspicious. -Alert all patrols. We'll get him tonight. -It's not the risk, excellency. But if the suspect me too much I'm of no use to you. Keep it, my lord. Keep it. If you're not satisfied-- I am a friend, excellency. A friend needs no reward. -Kill him. -No, no, no. -He had his uses, sir. -When the slave can call his master friend, this day our world has ended. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE NEIGHS] [SCREAMS] -Look. [LAUGHING] -Come on, come on. Let's go. ARCANOS: It's dangerous for all of you. And more dangerous for some. I know, I know. This is no atmosphere to learn or teach philosophy. I'm sorry. The very fact that I'm speaking to you puts every living man in danger. And there you must think. Look at you. Back tight with elbows in each other's ribs, and one ear cocked listening for the next patrol. Bear with me, coming from the freedom of Athens, I must seem to you to talk a language out of key with the troubles of your time. Perhaps what I can tell you just because I've taught in an atmosphere of freedom may help you to envision a world you can make here in Syracuse for your children and your children's children. Keep half your mind about how dangerous it is-- [VOICE FADES] DAMON: You down there, Styrian guards, no luck tonight? I can tell you where they are meeting. -Who's that? Who called? DAMON: Someone with information to sell. Will you pay? -Yes, I will pay. Stop. All right, come down. -I can't negotiate from here. A gold piece will do. -All right. -Throw. -Where's the meeting? -Where's the reward? -You have to go to the temple of the old guard out under the city wall. -I know it. We've seen your face. You better be right. -When you're teaching your students or you guards, you fellow soldiers, remember always that our very first principle is the unity of all nature. We are all one with all life. Even your enemy is your brother. More, he is a part of you. If you kill him, you yourself die a little. -Just a moment, just a moment, information to sell, what's it worth? -Give and we'll tell you. -No, no, tell it and I'll give it. The guards, the guards know this meeting and that you're here. Get out. -How do they know, the guards? -I told them. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Our leader, our beloved Protheus has passed on. I tell you know his last wish that we waste no time in tears. Go on with our work. -Without him, that won't be easy. -Who is to take his place? -We'll see later. -Pythias, what do you say? -We need a decision now. -He's right. -Let's have it. -We will decide. Be patient. -Protheus just died. Surely, we can wait and think. -Always wait, always think. -Protheus has been dying a long time. Surely, you've given thought to his successor. -We are giving consideration to Arcanos, the missionary, a man of wisdom. -Then let's send for Arcanos, bring him back from Syracuse. -We've sent him messages before. He never received them. -All of our beliefs, our whole movement, depends on a great leader. Let us send a man of courage to find Arcanos and bring him back now. -More than a man of courage, he must have conviction. -Very well then, let us find a young man able to stand hardships. -There are many among us. -No Pythias, only one. Will you come up here. Do you fully realize the peril of this mission? -I do. -Then repeat after me, I, Pythias, of Athens-- -There no, does that make me look matronly enough, dignified, responsible? MEREKA: Dreafully. -Mother of six? MEREKA: Well, hardly, you haven had the first one yet. -Oh, Mereka, is it rather terrible? I shall be a real matron. I shall beginning to get old. Do you think it would change for Pythias? He liked me young and not too solid. He must see I'm not going to become dowdy and boring. Come, look at me. It's because he's just a serious old thing himself that he likes me. -Silly? -Well, a man as clever as Pythias with a sister as clever as you can afford silly wife. But anyhow, I'm not. I enormous hidden depths. -They don't leak out? -That's don't, idiot. Oh, Mereka, I do love him so. [PYTHIAS' VOICE IN GARDEN] Pythias. -The beloved step, that sacred voice. what do you bet it's the gardener arguing with the cook about how fresh the vegetables were yesterday. -Pythias. -What did I tell you? The gardener and the cook. -Then I'm in love with the gardener. What's wrong? -Wrong? -You're cold, really. You might as well have been the gardener. Demetrius, greetings, my brother. -Darling, I've got to tell you something. Something's happening. Let's sit down. Protheus is dead. -Poor old man, I liked him. He was kind. -He was more than that. He was a great leader. Now, there's only one man who can take his place. And that's Arcanos. And Arcanos is in Syracuse. He's working in secret because our philosophy is forbidden there. We teach the brotherhood of man. And their tyrant Dionysius, teaches war. Now-- -Sweetheart, not politics, not today. I do try to take an interest, but it was only this morning that the midwives said we could be sure about the baby, remember. No politics today, Pythias. -Darling, please, you must listen. This is very important. -Of course, it's more important than us, than me and my baby. -No. -You can't have it both ways, Pythias. Women have no minds, no capacity for your philosophy. We have no place at the feet of your teachers or in what ideas you spread in the world. All right, but then don't expect us to take intelligent interest, when you bring the important nonsense of your great schools where we live and love and bear your children. Come on, Mereka. Leave them to their philosophy. -You'll learn how it is. You'll have to put up with a lot of this in the next few months. -You've got to tell her you're going to Syracuse to find out Arcanos. You've got to. -I can't tell her. She won't understand. She'll plead with me to stay and get all upset. Demetrius, you'll have to tell her for me. -They sent him to certain danger. And you knew. You let him go. You, Demetrius, my own brother, you for your game of politics. You let them send my husband, and you didn't raise a hand to stop them. Did you? Did you? MEREKA: There was nothing he could do. -And you, are you woman at all? Did you try to stop him? Or to warn me? I pray that your husband leave you as you've taken mine from me. -All right, take you grief out on me. -Oh, heavens, he didn't even tell. That's what hurts. He didn't love me enough even to tell me. I want to die. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Pythias, you say. We haven't treaty before, have we? -No. -I have a piece here that got broken on the voyage. It's a fairly common shape. -They shouldn't have sent you. Not now, go back, go back at once. -I must get in touch with Arcanos. -Shh, for pity's sake, this is Syracuse. You can't meet him, him of all people. Go back. -Protheus is dead. I've been sent to bring Arcanos back to replace him. -He's disappeared, in hiding. -Arcanos is a man we can't lose. Now, who else would know where he is. -I can't help you. Here, to show that you have traded of this. Go back on the ship that brought you here. Go back, go back. -The arrangements were that I was to stay here. But I have no idea where even to start. -All to the good. Go. Go. -That's a lot for one man to carry, sir. May I help you? I assure it's no trouble at all. Currier. Where your manners? -Ah, thank you, no, this I can manage myself. -Well, where to, sir. -The fact is I have no idea. Is there an inn around here? -Oh, there's one but it's not a place for such a merchant as you would stay. -For the moment it will have to do. -It's not far, around the corner by the gate. -Thank you. -Have a long journey. -Yes. -From Athens? -Yes, from Athens. -Say, do you-- are you sure this is the right way? -Yes, this is the short way. Go on. -Help! Help! Guards. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Take it then. -What do you want of me now? -A way out. The guards are coming. -Well-- well, come on, they'll be here in a minute. -Check in there. -That way. -Now. There's our way. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. This workmanship isn't bad, but I've stolen better, and with less effort. Well, we thieves don't live as easy as you honest folk. Uh, huh. Pythagorean. -Who? -I can be useful to you. A stranger with the guards after him will find difficulty contacting his friends. Now, I come and go where I like in Syracuse. Pythagorean from Athens, Arcanos. -Arcanos? -Well, that's it, isn't it. You'll have difficulty contacting him. He's been in hiding for months. Now what's my help worth? -Nothing but trouble, I suspect. -Oh, I'll just keep these pieces and pen for what I've already done. -Tell you what, you can have the weight of them and any other piece in the bag. -These are the only pieces I like. -Listen, when I contact my friends, I'll have access to all the money I need. If you help me, I'll give you half the contents of that bag. -You come too suddenly and at night, you'll find yourself with a knife in your guts like anyone else. Who's that? -Pythias, merchant of Athens meet Adriana. She's mad about me. -Merchants are wriggling on their bellies like lizards along parapet nowadays? -Well, it's a sign of the times. If they come from Athens and they are Pythagoreans, they do. Oh, don't worry. Adriana has no love for Dionysius. Both her parents were killed in one of his wars. She'll be not danger to you. -With the guards after us, we're liable to be a danger to her. Knowing Damon, it's a danger I'm used to. You can stay here and I can feed you. -I have-- I should say, we have some silver. You could sell some for us. What do you say to letting Adriana hold the silver? -Adriana, take that and hide it. -What are you paying Damon for? -His help. -Why? -Because I have to. -Listen, Adriana, the pythagoreans consider that all men are brothers, so that makes you his sister. And that's all right with me. -But what help? -Find Arcanos. -No, Damon, no. Stay out of this. You don't understand, Cariso has all the guards in Syracuse after that man. You keep your silver. Damon, Damon, please, stay out of this. -Come, it's getting late. We'll take this and we'll hide it under the bed. Let's make a pillow out of this. And if the lumps bother you just remember the value of fine Athenian silverware. [GIGGLES] -Oh, come in. Make yourself comfortable. -Ah, may I? -Please. Brothers and sisters, huh? Oh, by tomorrow at dusk, I'll have collected a few friends that know a thing or two. -Pythagoreans? -No, no, friends of mine. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLES] -Damon. -It's nice to be among villains once again after the company I've been keeping. There's money in it. [LAUGHTER] Now, the risks. I want to find Arcanos. [CROWDS MURMURS] Chloe, you know something? -What do you want him for? -I just told you, money. -They're a harmless lot. -No, not to sell him to the guards. I want to get a message to him from Athens. -A man I know hit a Pythagorean after the raid on Malum, the carpenter. -Who? -Chromus, the schoolmaster. -Chromus left Syracuse yesterday. -Any other leads? [FLUTE PLAYING] -All right, interpret that. -Folks go to Libia, the silversmith, but don't buy silver. -No good. -Arrested this afternoon anyhow. -All right, start looking. Announce weight of pure silver for a lead that gets us anywhere. But leave the taverns, play in the streets. Get the children the dancing. When they ask for tunes, get them to talking. Find out who has a stranger in his home. Now, go to it, all of you. Any news, you give it to the barber on Long Street. [DRUM BEAT] -Throat dry suddenly? Guilty conscience? -You're bad for business. -Insolence. -You know Damon? -Who doesn't? -Tell him Phylemon, street of the grains. Phylemon, street of the grains. Really? Very interesting. -Keep your head down until after dark. Water? It's an oven up here by day. I want to see you alone. Please, leave Damon out of this affair. -You love him, don't you? -No, I'm such a fool. He's Impossible. But in his way he can be a friend. Well, for your own sake, he's rash. He'll get you into worse danger. He's coming. I must get back to the market. Please. -Where you going? -I must rush. I must get back to my work. -Well, I found out where some of your friends will be staying tonight. -Good, I'll leave you at dusk. I'll give you half the silver now, the other half when I find Arcanos. -Oh, no, we go together. -All I need is a lead. -You need a keeper with your views on no bloodshed and going around unarmed in this town. -You care? -Yes, for my money. Tell me something. What do you get out of this? Is Arcanos a rich man or something? -No, as a matter of fact, like most teachers he's a poor one, except in spirit. -Powerful? -Not at least in the way you mean. -Well, he's not rich or powerful, love? He's got a wife, huh? A daughter, a sister? -Neither one. In fact, I have a wife of my own. -Well, then what has he got that you want? -Importance to the cause we both serve. -Importance to the-- -All right, we'll risk accepting what you say. -I must see him myself. I must talk to him. Other messengers have come before and failed. -I feel sure of you, but yet-- -If you're from Cariso, very well, I've betrayed myself, but we cannot betray Arcanos. -If I were from Cariso, would I know the sacred teachings of Pythagoras. -What is the world in which we live? -It's a sphere. Its round like the sun and the moon. -Huh. -The tetractys, by which we swear, the progression of numbers. DAMON: I've always used them just for eating. -What music did Pythagoras compose? -Was found that a tuned string clamped at half its length will sound an octave, at three quarters, a fourth, and at 2/3, a fifth, showing that everything has its place as a number in the hole. And the hole is harmony-- -He's one of us. -All right, it's a little complicated to explain where Arcanos is. You take the road-- -Listen, just leave the finding of the way to me. There isn't a man living who knows Syracuse better than I do. Just tell me where he is. I'll find him. -Just a moment Phylemon, we don't know your friend. -You don't propose to say that you do? -How can I? You're not one of us. -All right, whisper your secrets into their shell-like ears, I'll commune with the wine. [FLUTE PLAYING] Listen, stop that racket, will you? Much problems, lots of money, huh, and we end up with a few drops of wine. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Message for you. Interested? From high up, way up. Interested? -No. -Pity. Nice profession mine, telling fortunes, selling love potions, get to know all sorts of noblemen like you, and scum like officers of the guards wanting to meet scum like you. Cariso want to meet scum like you. Funny, a funny thing. -Cariso wants to me? Cariso arrests me. -Not if he wants to meet you socially, he doesn't -In and out of troubles since you were big enough to run about the streets alone. And I offer you immunity. Living on your wits, and I offer you security. A marked man, and I offer you your freedom. Well? -You offer me how much? -20 gold pieces. -You need me, sir. Even Dionysius' first minister, when in need, needs to pay. For instance, you'll have to pay me with that. -With what? See what it is. -The best of your stable, sir. -He's yours. Now, I want Arcanos. Where is he? -Well, your excellency, this will need a little secrecy. -Agreed. -Only one man can lead you to Arcanos. -Well, his name is Pythias. -Who? -Pythias, well, he's an Athenian. He's tall. Not quite as good looking as I am. -I see. You know him. -Yes, we're friends of sorts. We were friends. -Stay his friend. It will be useful. -Well, I hear my new friend calling. So with your excellency's permission. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, I see you're still here. -I was going to leave you a message. I'm staying elsewhere. -Don't. Listen, you riled me. You know, a fellow likes to be trusted once in awhile. But I started with you on this, and I'm going to see it through. -That's all right. I was going to leave this with Adriana for you. Here, to pay for all you've done. And thanks. -Oh, no, I haven't gotten you to Arcanos yet. -I thought I heard. It's all right. He's leaving. But Damon, what's this about a horse? -What horse? -The barber told me the Pokus had seen you riding outside the gate. -Oh, well, he's not mine. A fellow let me ride him. What a horse. He's got grace and is full of fire. He gives a man dignity. I think I'll call him-- -What? -Well, he already has a name. -Pokus said it had the guard's brand on it. Since when have you had a friend in the guards? -Well, of course, it had the guards brand on it. It's the guard's horse. I-- I was at the palace last night. They picked me up. Someone recognized me. -Damon. -It didn't mean anything. I was only there a minute. Someone must have given them my name. -Where you questioned? -Now, look, they know me. A Pythagorean, me? No, many things, but not that. -And the man who knew your name and had you arrested, didn't know you? -You know the kind, always trying for promotion. The other guards just laughed at him. -And so they gave you a fine horse to ride to console you for false arrest. -I don't think you understand what I've been saying. No, not at the palace. Like Adriana said, out beyond the gate. This other guard, he was thrown. I came up-- -If I were you, I'd call that horse Cariso. -What do you mean? -I mean you sold me. You came back to get into my confidence, to lead them through me to Arcanos. -Well, that's ridiculous. -No, Pythias, no. -We don't kill. -You would have killed him, wouldn't you? -Yes, I would. -How is she? -No better, the doctor said this morning that she could get better but she doesn't want to. live. Pythias must come home. -He won't until his mission has ended. -You must go to Syracuse, Demetrius, and tell him he must. -But, Mereka-- -No buts. You go or your sister will die. And you bring back Pythias, Arcanos or no Arcanos, or you can tell him his wife will die. Nerissa, Demetrius is here and he has news for you. -I'm going to Syracuse, Nerissa. I'm going to find Pythias and bring him back. -He won't come -He loves you. He'll come. -Promise me, Nerissa, you'll do all the doctor says until I come back. -Just till then. -Hey, Damon, who's face is that you've got on? -Leave him alone. He's taking a philosophy in spoiling his liver. Huh, his Greek friend turned out not to have anything else to offer. -Here, it's money, money. That's all you think a man is worth. -I'd save some, Damon. If that came from your Greek, that's the last you'll see. He's left Syracuse. -What do you mean? -Well, he went through the gate an hour ago. What's the matter? Owed you more? Well, that's a Greek for you. -Are you hurt? -No, pack of jackals. -For what they are worth, they are the only friends you've got. -Yes, but I could have one that was really worth something, first time in my life, a man, a man you really could think something of. -He wasn't your sort. Ask me, and I don't think he's even human. -He made me angry. And I went and proved him even righter. -Forget it. He's gone now anyway. -Yes, it's too late. -Damon, Damon, be Damon again. Today's today. Remember? Today we are alive. -Well, getting your money's worth? -No, we're on the trail of your Athenian. Seems he slipped out last night. -Where's he heading. -Scouts ahead are keeping him marked. You're lathering up that horse of yours. -Yes, I better walk him. Good luck. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What do you want? -I'm looking for a stranger. A man-- -Pythias. -Arcanos, thank the gods. -In heaven's name, what are you doing here? -Looking for you. You're desperately needed. I've been sent from Athens to bring you home. -I can't go, but tell me. -Now don't you be difficult. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I hate to abandon the work that we started here. -I'll tell you one man who will be happy when you do-- Cariso. But we've got to make it for the coast as fast as we can. I've made arrangement for a fishing boat-- DAMON: Hey. -Damon. -Listen, I come as a friend. Cariso has been on you track ever since Syracuse. -That's a lie, Arcanos. -No, Pythias, it's not a trap. I cut that bridge down back there. It'll slow them down, but it won't keep them away forever. Don't you believe me? They're tightening a noose around your neck. What-- all right, look up there. -Come on. Quick. You take the cart. Shepherd, we're leaving. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm very tired. I would like to sleep. -We can't wait till morning. -We're safe enough here. Cariso will have to wait for light too. -You two sleep. I'll stand guard. -You get some sleep. Why don't you get out of here while you can? -And miss all the fun? -You don't belong in my troubles. -I enjoy troubles, especially when their someone else's. -But seriously, Damon, I want to thank you for what you did today. I feel a gratitude-- -Even though I betrayed you to Cariso? -Why did you do that? -For a horse, for a marvelous horse. That's the way I am. And that's the way I always will be. Why? Because ever since I was five years old, I had to fight for every piece of bread I ever ate. I never lived in a nice home, had a family like you. To me, every man's an enemy, that's why. -And to me, every man's a friend. Tell me, Damon, why are you helping me now? -Why do you always ask such difficult questions? I don't know. It's something I never felt before. Go to sleep. -All right, we'll will split the watch. I'll be back later. -Pythias? -Yes? -Has your son been born yet? -No, he hasn't. -Have you thought of a name for him? -Not yet. -Well, if you can't think of a better one, call the brat Damon, will you? -I will. -In your clothes. If Cariso sees me, I'll try to lead him off. Damon, you now the way Lead us to the coast. [HORSE NEIGHING] [TYMPANUM BEATING] Hurry. [MUSIC PLAYING] -They told me you were his friend. You are the only one who can help him. You must do something. -He's in the palace prison. What do you suppose anyone can do? -Can't you understand? You are a woman. Think of my sister. She'll die, I tell you. Her baby will never be born. Three lives and you aren't even interested. -Do you want it to be four lives? Stupid fellow. He thinks all you have to do is walk into the palace and ask them to let Pythias go. -It's ridiculous. Three days ago, at the war, we killed hundreds and hundreds of men with all their problems, here in peace I'm called to judge one man, one poor little man with his poor little problem. Because he a man, he's not a man he's an idea, he's protected by the law. And I am the law. You must have something pretty valuable to offer in exchange. -I have, my lord. -You must have paid in worth. -I'm not a religious man, my lord, and I doubt that you are. But your people have their superstitions. Now the gods are supposed to be prepared to accept what's called sacrifice of substitution. So I offer you a Damon for a Pythias. -Idiot, that means we've got you both. -Yes, yes, of course, it's interesting, however, as an example of this philosophy of theirs. So all men are brothers, hm? -Not mine, my lord. I like to feel I can pick and choose. I'd hate to think I came from the same litter as Cariso. -Friend? -He's my friend. -Ridiculous, no one does such a thing simply for a friend. -You don't have any friends. -But you can't really think that you are a fair exchange for an important political prisoner. -In the eyes of the gods, insofar as they have any, a man is a substitute for a man. And in the eyes of your people, and they have plenty, certainly one man from Syracuse is worth 10 from Athens. -Well, the eyes of the gods may see you both die, but the people of Syracuse will hear very little about it, my friends. DAMON: They already know, my lord. By now all Syracuse knows of the offer that I've come to make you. I have very useful friends when it comes to spreading news. CARISO: His friends are good for nothings, thieves, down and outs, like himself. -Yes, yes, women of the streets, barbers, public entertainers, people that talk to the people you better fear. -Fear the scum of Syracuse? Take him away. -No, no, Cariso. Bring up this Pythias. And-- I'll come back and look into this. [SWORDS CLASHING] -Go on. -No. -You must not lose your balance, sire. Upward, thrust upward. -Look, father, look, blood. -Well done. How much of this has resulted while I've been away? -Two hours a day, my lord, arms drill. Three hours, horsemanship. And hour's gymnastics. -That really was a thrust wasn't it, Hermione? Oh, Hermione, it really is deep. I didn't mean to. Get him seen to quickly, won't you? -Come here my boy. Leave your sword. Swords have their own places. I want you to learn something else this morning. -Now I want you to stay quietly and watch how the situation you're good to see is happening. -Pythias, the Athenian, my lord. -This man has offered himself as a sacrificial substitute for you. His life for yours in the name of the gods. -Damon, you were free. Why are you doing this? -It's what you would have done. -No, you can't force me to accept. -Yes, I can as it happens. But I have a more interesting offer to make to you both. It seems that your wife in Athens is dying. -My wife is what? -Demetrius is here. He thinks she'll die before the baby is born. -So you see your choice will be between your friend's life he offers you and your wife. But I told you I have a more interesting idea. You go free. And Damon keeps your place here. I give you two months. At the sunset, two months from today, Damon dies in your stead unless on that day you're back. -I'll be back. I'm anxious to test the power of this philosophy of brotherhood of yours. The whole of Syracuse will be told of the gamble that has been taken. Do you fully understand? -Yes, I understand. And I'll be worthy of such a friend. -Put him aboard a ship for Greece. And take him away. In Heaven's name, my lord, do you want turn the whole of your country over to their mad philosophy. -You see, my son, their philosophy is dangerous, particularly dangerous because it makes slaves brothers to their masters and soldiers brothers to their enemies. But Pythias won't come back. And Damon will die publicly and their philosophy will be utterly discredited. -But he will come back. He will. -You don't know their mad fanaticism, my lord. He'll come back. -I doubt it. I doubt it, but if by any chance he does, he will be stopped. You see? You have a lot to learn. -Damon, you're not going to be a thieve. You're going to be a perfect man like your father, a great man. -Well, make the most of your time with him. At 6:00, we'll start him in the Pythagorean schools. Shall we make an astronomer of him, Pythias? Look how he stares at the heavens. Let him cry for the moon at night, Nerissa. You can't start his interests too young. -You're not going to make any sort of philosopher out of him. I'm going to bring him up to be a perfect fool like me. -Treason, at least we don't need to watch the process. -How does she seem to you? -Magically strong and well, but-- -I must leave her soon. -Leave it as long as you can. -As long as I dare. -Pythias, this time you'll tell her. -Yes, this time I must. -What are you thinking lying there? -What it would be like if I lying on the ceiling staring at the floor. It would make a difference, wouldn't it? You know, you might tell Cariso that I know Dionysius wants to keep me fattened up for the big day, but not with garbage like this. -You think he'll come back, don't you? -Well, don't they in Syracuse. -Funny thing, quite a lot of them do? -Well, confidentially, what do you believe? Trust Pythias. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Tell me. -Hm? I will but not tonight. Tomorrow. -Not one more hour, always tomorrow you'll tell me what's troubling you. And every day I can see it troubles you worse. Dear heart, can't you see how it troubles me too now? Once before you didn't trust me, remember? And that hurt me almost to death. I'm stronger than you think, Pythias, so long as I'm secure in your love. -Darling, it's-- well, it-- it's Damon. -Damon, yes? Something about him haunts you. What is it? You have a message from him? -No, it's-- it's not a message. -There's some feeling of guilt. Something you did that you are ashamed of. Oh, my darling, nothing you could have done could make me think less of you. -It's not something I've done. It's something I must do. -Oh, I see. You must go back? Is that it? -Yes, yes, I must. -How great is the danger, Pythias? The danger-- the danger is great. -Last time you didn't dare tell me in case I should dissuade you. Well, I mustn't. Then I mustn't. I won't. I promise you. Only tell me why. You got Arcanos out. Why can you possible need to go back again. -For Damon. -He's in danger? But you said he lived and thrived by it. -He's in danger of death, Nerissa. -You said you had no message from him. You mean he was in danger when you left? Then that's your guilt. But, dearest, it's his country. -It's because of me. -Because you involved him in your mission? Oh, I see. He's caught. He's in prison. -Yes, if I go back, he will be released. You see, it was I who was caught. He offered himself for me, my substitute before the gods, so that I could go free. -Oh, Pythias. -You were ill, perhaps dying they said. So I accepted. But if I don't go back on the appointed day, he'll die. -Damon, Damon, I'm glad we called the boy Damon. Yes. You must go back. -You-- you see that I must? -Of course, you must. He staked his life and your word. But my darling, for how long? How long will they keep you in prison? Well they let me see you sometimes? I'll send Syracuse and bring the baby, of course. But every day I don't see you if so long, so long. How long, Pythias? Don't you know how long? No. No. No. Are you mad? -You said yourself that I must. To prison, yes, that's enough. But to die, deliberately to go back to die? To be killed? Free and safe and happy to go back in cold blood to be butchered like and animal. -Or let Damon die and my honor with him. -I don't care about your honor. He shouldn't have done it. It's too much to ask of any man. -If he hadn't have done it, I would have died already. Would you have lived, my darling? -I would have rather have died than live through this. It's his own fault. He's playing the hero, thinking he's safe. Let him be a hero. Let him die. -Darling, I've said that to myself. Not only for your sake, but for mine, to my shame. You know I must go. You know it. -Your wife. -My wife-- -You seem surprised. -I am. I expected her last week. And you call yourself a good wife. I'll forgive you this time. -I'm so frightened for you. -What for? -You haven't changed even in these shadows. Damon, what if he doesn't come back? -He will. In time though? -Now did you come to talk of Pythias or to see me? -How can you-- -Adriana, I think of you more than ever now. It's one of the few luxuries they allow me in a place like this. -Have you thought what will happen to you, if-- -There's no need to. He will come back. Now enough of Pythias. -No. -Well, what kind of wife are you? -I'm not your wife. -Why not? [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] -Your pass. -I haven't one. I just arrived from Athens. My name is Pythias. -All right, you can go through. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, which way to city? -Straight ahead past the orange tree and to the right. [MUSIC PLAYING] -And we didn't see him come to the surface. -You then descended. Did you search the rocks? The beach? -We saw no need. From the height, he must've been killed. -He must have been killed? Stupid! We can't be sure unless we have his body. Search! And bring in the body of this Pythias. [FLUTE PLAYING] -How long have you been here? PYTHIAS: I don't know. I've been so many places. -Are you all right, now? PYTHIAS: Yes. -When the sun goes down, Damon will be executed. PYTHIAS: He won't be executed. -A man has been drowned, you know anything about it? -Drowned man? No. -And you. Get up. -Nothing. -Come on. -Is there anything you need? -Yes, water. FLUTE PLAYER: This afternoon, as agreed. -As agreed, this afternoon. [TRUMPETS BLARING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Where are the cheers of our loyal populace for its beloved leader? -My lord, Dionysius, the fact is that we haven't got a loyal populace. And the one we've got doesn't love us much. -They make it strikingly clear. [TRUMPETS BLARING] [DRUM BEATS] -Too many of your subjects admire him. -They've even cried his death. But tomorrow they'll say he was a fool. [FLUTE PLAYING] -Hey, you? Where you going? -Citizens of Syracuse, you see before you the pathetic dupe of a false philosophy from which in my fatherly concern I will protect you. It's almost that appointed hour. The sun sinks. But where is the follow Pythagoras? His saving grace and leaves his friend to die in his place, so much for the brotherhood of men. -If Pythias is not there, it's because he's been stopped, stopped by this father of his people. So if I die, I still have faith in my friend. [CROWD MURMURS] -Friendship, such a simple emotion, yet the king who cannot rise above it, can be destroyed. -What happened? -Pythias is alive and on his way here. -This is your responsibility. Finish the matter and return immediately. [DRUM BEAT] [MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSES GALLOPING] [TYMPANUM BEATING] -Stop! Halt! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey. [MUSIC PLAYING] -No, no, don't. [SNARE DRUM] -Kneel. Alas, Damon, now you regret your bargain, do you not? -No, I do not. SOLDIER: Ready. -The law is the law, my son, for him as well as for us. [DRUM ROLL] [CROWD ROARING] -You killed Cariso. -No, we killed him. -Take him down. Put him up. -Father, please, let them both live. CROWD: Show mercy, great Dionysius. Show greatness. Be wise. Away with tyranny. Let him live. Let him live. [CROWD ROARING] -My people, I'm but your servant. As you wish, let them both live. [CROWD CHEERS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
