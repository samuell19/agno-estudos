I bid you enter of your own free will. - Okay. Really, you live here. - I told you I was staying here. - Alone? - You ask a lot of questions. - I just wanna know who all the players are. - Are we playing? - You know we are. - Would you like to clean up? - Sure. - What size are you? - Excuse me? - Shirt size, pant size? The owner left some clothes, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind if we used them. - Large shirt, 38 waist. Just like high school. - I believe we can accommodate. (foreboding music) - Sorry. Why did you pick me up anyway? - Seemed like the thing to do. - When I'm standing there, I just watch the cars go by. There's nothing much else to do but that or think, and I don't like to think. Then your car passed by. A few minutes later you came back and picked me up. Why? - I liked the way you looked. - So you picked me up to fuck me. - [Theodora] I picked you up to bring you here. Whatever happens after that... - Doesn't happen a lot, but it happens. - [Theodora] Does it? - Some chick drives by, sees the package, starts to ask herself what it'd be like. What it'd be like to pick me up, take me home, have her way with me. Oh yeah, it happens. - Now you're hurting my feelings, I thought I was going to be your first. - You're too late to be my first. I'm not yours either. - My what, my first hitchhiker? - Sure, am I? What are you? - What am I? - Nationality, Italian? What is this stuff? - It's wine. - [Hitchhiker] Where's the bedroom? (unsettling music) (serene piano music) (ominous music) (gun fires) (woman yelps) (screeches) (screams) (crickets chirp) (wolf howls) (gasps) - Somebody's out there! - What the fuck? What? I don't see anything. - [Sky] Where are you going? - [Morrissey] I'm gonna go look about. - Be careful. - I'll be all right, stay here. (door opens) There's nothing. What did you see out there? - A hand, a bloody hand hitting the window. - [Morrissey] There's nothing. - I definitely saw something. - [Morrissey] Were you dreaming? - Don't start. - I'm not starting, I'm just asking. So you saw a hand hit the window. - [Sky] Yes. - Man's hand, woman's? - I don't know, what does it matter? - [Morrissey] You said it was bloody. - Yes, that I know. - Well, there's no blood on the window. There's nothing on the window except for some bird crap. Just a big damn bird. - You think I was dreaming? - Bird crap. (Morrissey sighs) - I dreamed that two women were making love. - I could use a dream like that. Sorry. - I shot them. - [Morrissey] Well, it's a good thing I don't subscribe to Freud. - Then I woke up, I heard a sound, I looked out the window, and a hand hit the glass. - Is that kinda like the shit hitting the fan? - You are so not funny. - Come on. Come on, Sky, I'm sorry. - No. - I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. I was just trying to lighten the mood. Hm? You want to... - You are impossible, no. Early to bed, early to get started, remember? (phone rings) - Saved by the bell, great. - [Sky] Hold onto that for me, won't you? - Oh, well, it's always there if you need it. (sighs) So you're just gonna leave me just like that, huh? - [Sky] You can always take things into hand. - Nice. Thanks. So you wanna fuck or what? Cause I think that's a yes. Cause I'm feeling yes. Yeah, no? Oh. I see. (foreboding music) - It is just memory. (cries) It is just time. Taste the past. - No. It was Bulgaria. How they would burn, kill, violate women and children. And nail the prisoners' ears to fences where they would hang them in the morning. - Don't do this to yourself. - I can see the bodies hanging from the trees. I can hear the rope scratching the bark. - They're humans. They're animals. - Imagine a baby in the arms of a trembling mother, surrounding by men who have just entered her home. They're having great fun. They fondle the baby and they try to make it laugh, and they are successful, yet lax. That moment a man pulls out a pistol, points it inches from the baby's face. The baby stretches out its fingers to touch the pistol, and it laughs. And suddenly, the man pulls the trigger, and blows the baby's brains out! (gasps) Artistic, isn't it? - Time to sleep. - Just look at this. Whoa. There's gotta be 30, 40 years of history here. It's just the top layer. - [Morrissey] Will you be all right here for a while? - [Sky] Yeah. - [Morrissey] Sky, come here! - What is it? Well that would put an end to the festivities. What do you think it means? - I saw this in Bosnia. This is what was written on the wall where I found my grandfather's body. It's the Jan Kantas, the symbol for the castrating mother, the all-consuming female. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. That was a long time ago. - Hey, sorry. - What? - [Sky] What's this? - What? - This. - This looks like cuneiform. It's a little bit different, what the hell is this doing here? - [Sky] Shouldn't be here. Didn't really want too many to be here, a collector? - I don't know. I'll take it to the lab. - [Sky] There can't be any more. - This just might be graffiti, but... (camera shutter clicks) God damn it! - [Sky] Are you all right? - [Morrissey] Not really. - Let me see. I said let me see it. - Ow. - You may need stitches. - [Morrissey] Come on. - Or at least a good cleaning. What did you do? - Uh, I cut it. - No shit, Sherlock. Let's get you back to camp. Here, go. - [Morrissey] It hurts. - [Sky] Deserve it. (rumbling) (tense synth music) (serene humming) - This is fantastic. You live here? Is there someone else here? - Only you and I.

(train horn blares) - You know, I'm not sure. - Hey, how you doing? - All right. I'm Dietrich. - [Morrissey] Morrissey. - Nice to meet you. - Sky. - Nice to meet you, Sky. - Don't ask. - [Dietrich] So this is, so what are you guys doing here? This is a strange place to be camping. - Yeah, well, we're starting a new fad, you know? Urban camping, maybe you heard of it. - Really? - No, no, not really. - Ignore him, the thinks he's funny. We're from the university, Department of Urban Archeology. - [Dietrich] What are you guys doing on the terminal? - Unfortunately we're not. We're not allowed in. - Private owner, refuses all requests, won't return phone calls. Just lets it sit there rotting. We were hoping you were him. - Sorry. - Hey, hey, is there any coffee? - I was just gonna make some fresh. Would you like a cup? - Please, thank you. So what do urban archeologists do? - We preserve future history. - Future history? - Mm-hm. It's a term my grandfather used to use. He'd say that most people think that history is something that happened a long time ago. But actually, history's an ongoing process. Every second history's being formed, even right now as we speak. And all this, all these buildings, they are history. One day they won't be here, but the records of them will be. Or at least we hope they'll be. - Thank you. - Just grab that, so yeah... The warehouse, it predates the terminal by what, 30 years? - [Sky] More than that. Terminal was built in 1930, warehouse was built around the turn of the century. - That's the turn of the 20th century. - [Sky] Warehouse was built for cattle. - Cattle? - Beef cattle. - Yeah, this whole area used to host a huge slaughter industry in the 1800s. It was only second to Chicago. Tens of thousands of cows were slaughtered here and shipped all across the east coast. - Yeah. (sighs) In 1918 it was turned into a hospital ward. - [Dietrich] Hospital ward? - The great influenza pandemic of 1918. More Americans died during that than the whole of World War I. Literally thousands of patients were isolated here. - They ended up burying most. - 90 something plus mortality rate. - [Dietrich] Man. - You're sitting in a graveyard. - [Morrissey] They moved most of the bodies to Forest Lawn in 1930. - [Dietrich] Most of the bodies? - [Morrissey] Most. - And in 1930 they built the terminal. And it ran till what, the early 70s? - 72, the time in between, the terminal and the warehouse used to house psych patients. - Most violent in the warehouse. - Whoa, I didn't know that. - It's another interesting story. - What? - Well, supposedly, when the warehouse was used to store psych patients, there was a separate ward for deformed children. I'm talking serious deforms, like kids, by no rules of nature should have survived childbirth. For whatever reason they did. There's no proof of that, though, however. - Wow, someone just walked over my grave. - [Morrissey] Yeah, well... I gotta get back to work. (sighs) - I should join you. - [Morrissey] Mm-hm. - Um, the private owner. - What about her? - [Sky] Are you gonna see her later? - I think so. - [Sky] Could you ask if we can visit, just to look around? - Assuming I see her again. - [Sky] Thanks. - No problem. - [Morrissey] All right, take it easy. (serene piano music) - You monsters, you bring me back my child! (chatting) - Mysterious. - Yeah, I guess so. - I'm so glad you're still here. - You have my backpack and the door is locked. - I'm so sorry. I had to leave early, forgive me. You were sleeping so soundly. This is Elenora, my old friend. And her friend... - Griffin, how are you? - Dietrich, hi. - Charmed. - The door was locked. - Well, the door might have swollen. You know, changes in the temperature and all that. It's a natural fucking phenomenon. Come on. - This is pure wine. - Thank you, sweetheart. - You'll love it. Cheers. - Cheers. So Dietrich, yeah? - Right. - So what do you do? - I'm in-between doing, I guess you could say. - (chuckles) I hear you. Yeah, I've been there. - What do you do? - Oh, me? I'm a writer. - Really? What have you written? - A little bit of everything. Copy, blogs, screenplays. You name it, I done it. - [Dietrich] Anything I might have seen or read about? - Oh, you? You, no. I doubt that, probably not. My publisher says my work tends to lean towards the esoteric. But, you know, it pays the bills. (chatting) - Elenora. - Yes. - [Dietrich] How do you know Theodora? - Where do I begin? (laughs) - Elenora and I have known each other for a long time. (ominous electro song) - Oh, I love that song. (giggles) - Yes. Did you find anything? - Find anything? - I assume you did some exploring this morning? - A bit. I was tired. Hey, did I break a glass last night? - There's tons of broken glass in this building. Why do you ask? - Cause I cut my arm, I think. - Show me. - [Dietrich] Well, it was so much worse this morning. - Every time you look at it, you will think of us. - Imagine so. (foreboding music) (chuckling) - So... What's all this about then? - Vanity. - Sorry, that wine must have gone straight to my head. - It will do that. Come. (chuckles) - So is this leading to where I think it's leading? - And where do you think this is leading to? - Me. And you. (laughs) Naked. Fucking. - Well. Let's find out, shall we?

What are you doing in here? - There's two women down there sleeping, well, I think they're sleeping. But they're in some sort of placenta membrane sac. - Did they invite you in? - What? - Did they invite you in? - What does that have to do with anything? They're down there... - I don't give a shit, Sky! This is their property, it ain't yours! - There's something wrong with them. - I don't give a flying fuck in a tree, what's wrong with them isn't the issue! What's wrong with you is. - How dare you talk to me like that. - How dare you break in. - Yeah, and what are you doing here? - I'm looking for your stupid ass. I got back early, I went to the warehouse, I called your cell phone, I called your name. I was gonna call the cops! Jesus Christ, I... I said to myself, she wouldn't go in there, she wouldn't go in there. But you know what, I knew that you would. And look, here you are. - Right, good deal, you found me. (man whimpers) - What an amazing place. - The phone is over here. - Phone's over there. Phone's over here, phone's over here. Rotary, what the frick? Come on! What the... Aw, come on! There's no dial tone! - This is an old building, sometimes the lines can be funny. - [Moby] (groans) Damn it! - Would you like a drink? - You and me, yeah, sure. Oh, why not? Oh yeah. - Take the edge off a little bit. Perhaps you can try again later and the lines will work. - Oh, this is good. - I'm glad you like it. - Yes. Yes, I do. Tell me. Do you really live here? - We're staying here, just for a little while. - [Moby] Oh, who's we? - Myself and my friend. - Oh really, yes. - Am I interrupting? - Not at all, Mr. Moby here was telling me. - Oh, please, please! Mr. Moby, Mr. Moby's like my dad. - Moby? - [Theodora] Found him on the side of the road, his car broke down. His cell phone doesn't work, and apparently our lines are down too. - That's too bad. If you call again after a while... - Oh, they might be up, yes, yes, I know. Damn it! That is so nice. - Have some more. - Where were you going? - To a party. - What's the old saying? The party's where you at. - Something like that. - My sentiments exactly. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 1940. - Pardon me? - This vintage. - Oh. Much, much older. - (gasps) What was that? (suspenseful music) - What's wrong? - I had the tablet translated today. - Really? Why didn't you tell me? What did it say? - It translated to, "With silver" and "At the eater of flesh".

I better go up there and check. - [Sky] You can't leave me here. - [Morrissey] They might have a phone up there, I have to go check at least. - Please! - Fuck.

You made that sign on my forehead. You said it would protect me. - Not against us. There are options. Shall I turn you, make you one of us? A sister in darkness? A sister of sorrows. We've long sought a third to complete our triumvirate. Or you could come back here in 1,000 years and discover this place all over again! Wouldn't you like that, huh?
