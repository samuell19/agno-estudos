Hey! Who are you? Get the hell out of here! Get him! Stop! You bastard! You poked his eye out! We’ll rip your head off! RHINO Batyr! Good boy! Where were you? Show me. Come inside. What happened? - I fell. Yeah, right. Show me! He got into a fight again. Huh, Vova? Yeah, I can see... Punch! What are you, a wimp? Punch! Harder! Harder! Damn it! You morons! Sveta! Sveta! - What? Is there any bread left? Ma! - Go to the store. I am almost done. Okay, I’m going. What a dork. Let's dance! - No! But Vova! - No! Get going. - Whatever! What are you standing there for? All right, here we go. Come on! Hey Halya! Here I am! Come on, Lyoha, pour us some more! My precious, my sweetheart! I read all your letters! Thanks. Halya, I feel so bad. I am so sorry. I'll never do that again. Stay with me, sweetheart! Give me a fork please. Listen. Five years and not a single care package. So what, does drinking start at 2 now? Did you hear, he chopped down all the vineyards? And how is he better than Brezhnev, this Gorby guy? Bottoms up! - Bottoms up! I’ll be right back. Kolya, stop! You get over here, bitch! Let go! Let me go! Let me go, hear me? Sign here. What’s in there? - Nothing of interest. Don’t be a smartass! All right, let’s go. Out! Daddy! My baby. Congratulations! I can see that! What else is new! Lyosha, your mom. Do you hear me? Your mom is here! Where’s mom? - There! Get my purse and sweater! Go, go, go! Hello. Hello. Lyosha! What was that? Easy! Is he really going to Afghanistan? - Yes. It’s gonna be all right. Ah, the paratroopers are here. I knew it! Where’s your uncle? What’s going on there? Hey mommy, time to feed Dimka! You're busy! You didn’t skim the foam off the meat. Nice! Mom! Lyosha, son! My God! Vova, come, look who’s here! Son! Aunt Klava has the same kind, she says they can’t figure it out. Mom, here, take this. Where are you going? - Work stuff. Lyosha, where? Can you figure it out? - How? It’s all in Japanese! I can’t understand anything. Mom, I’m off! What’s up, Batyr? What took you so long? Smudged you a bit. Good evening, Liudmylo Ivanivno! Look at him! Hello! What was it like in your home? Normal. Were you happy? Children are always happy. You just see the world differently. It seems honest and just. You think adults know everything. They understand everything. They always know what’s the right thing. You also think only kids can be cruel. And then you grow up and see that adults are worse than kids. And then you don’t even notice when you become an adult. And that you become bad yourself. As they say, there are no bad people, only bad actions. I’ve never seen my dad since that day. Probably got killed. Want some? You don’t drink and drive anymore? I’m different when I’m drunk. Dressed up like a slut! Hey! Five hundred. Per person! Where are you going? Maryna, Vova is getting wasted! It’s all good, guys. I tell you, take twenty at the minimum. Go take a walk. I asked you. What the heck? - I asked you too. Right. But I’m fine after this. I’m fine, too. - Yeah, I can see that. You said, you didn't care anymore? - I don’t give a damn. Vova, hi! What's up, bro! - Where are you going? I couldn’t tell if it’s you. Look, who's here. Why punch your own guys? - Stop! Let’s go! Back inside! Let’s go, I’m telling you. What happened? What the fuck? What's going on? - Step away from the window. Please, and wait for the officer. You file a report, you’re done. Got it? What did he say? - Gotta wait for the officer. Pick up the phone. Is this all of them? No others? - Yes. Don’t spit, you’re not at home. Will you file a report? - Nah. How old? - Underage. Oh, there you are again! Hello. - Howdy, howdy. What are you doing here? - I’m resting. Sober? Drunk? Sober. Ok, sit here, we’ll deal with you in a minute. Give me the keys! Okay, kids, get up and go home, back to mom and dad, and wash your mug. What about him? - You’re free too, only one road ahead. I’ll see you again soon. And you stay here, sit down. Did you snatch the bike? Put it down. - It’s not him! Yeah right, not him! Bro, can you help us lift something over there? Right here? - Yeah. Let’s go. - Thanks. Where are you from? - Dzerzhynka. My grandma lives there! Grandma? - Yes, I thought you look familiar. Hi! - Hi. What’s up? - All good. All good? - Yeah. Can you lend us money? - I don’t have any. What do you mean? Let's look! - Honestly, I don’t have any. Why did you come to the market? - To hang out. Hang out? And what’s this? It's my mom’s. - Mom’s? At least leave some to get home. - Here, say hi to mom. Thanks for your help. Bon appétit! Sucker. Mommy’s money. And here’s for you to get home. - Cool. Tucha is wondering, have you decided? As I said, I don’t want to be below anyone. Why aren’t you going? - They won’t take me without you. What are you, a filler? You kidding, bro? We’re together! Hey, Karas, watch me! Guys, please! Young and stupid... The gym is closed. - I don’t think so. Are you dumb or something? - What? Get the fuck out! Where? - The fuck out! Are you fucked in the head? Or do you think you’re immortal? Stasik, come over here! Do you know this idiot? This is Vova. - Where does he live? Here, on Factory Street. Used to... Listen here, Vova. You owe us money now. Tomorrow you bring 500 bucks to Beriozka. Do you know where that is? You’ll find out, fucker. If there’s no money, Stasik will show us where you live, and we’ll burn down your house. And you will burn with it. That’s it, get the fuck out of here. What a dumb fucker. What the fuck, asshole! Have you lost it? You'll bring a thousand tomorrow. Or you'll fucking burn with your house for sure. Take him the fuck out of here. And his crap, throw it the fuck out. What’s this? - I fell. You used to fall on your hands, now your head? Maybe you’ll get wiser? Here. Mom, how much money do you have? I don’t have any. I spent everything, and the next payment isn't soon. How much do you need? We can borrow from Aunt Klava. I’m not gonna need it tomorrow. What happened? Mumbled something and left... Are you up? Get up, I need to have a word with Tucha. Right the fuck now? - Yes, now. Can it wait till tomorrow? - Tomorrow I can’t. Head to Babylon. Where? - Babylon, on the Avenue... Ah yes, I know. That’s it. - All right, bye. So? - All good. All right, you’re with us now. I’ll tell you later, what your job will be. Don’t sweat it. And enough of your chickenshit. What about the bald guy? That’s Skull. We’ll go and have a talk about you tomorrow. And you don’t get involved. Guys are not just fists and guns, you also... You gotta know how to talk. Tolyasha, take all your guys tomorrow. The twins, too. Have them bring the tools. Who the fuck knows what Skull is up to. He’s mental. All right, you can go now. Rhino! Hey, enough. Get lost! Skull, the boy doesn’t owe you anything. He’s with me now. Tucha, don’t bullshit me. He didn’t claim he was with you. Skull, it’s done. The boy is with me. That’s not how we do things around here. You know that. Let it go, Skull. Go to Beriozka, have some tea. It’s done. Tucha, I will make him pay. We’ll see. Son of a bitch! We got them off for you. He still has beef with you. So be it! Up to you. Do we burn this stuff? - Why the fuck not? Plus, go get some gas! But the canister... Out of the tank, do I have to teach you? Move, man, or you will burn too. Smartass! Do you know whose land you're crawling on? If you have set out on a trip with a friend, The journey is more cheerful. Without friends, there is just a little bit of me, But with friends, there’s a whole lot of me. What is snow, or heat, or pouring rain to me, when my friends are here with me. Where it is difficult to do things alone, I will figure it out with you, Where I can’t understand something, I will figure it out with friends! What is snow, or heat or pouring rain to me, when my friends are here with me. Have you decided? No fucking need to, everything remains how it is. You sure? - No changes. Your call, I gave you time. Vova, you alive? The fuck is this? Must be Karas, the fucker. Why are you still moving? - Karas, you fuck, come here! Time to sleep! Come here, you cross-eyed fish! Wow! - Seeing it the first time, huh? At last! Where were you? Work stuff. Here’s something for you. I told you not to have this stuff in the house. Stop that. Was there no terracotta? - What? Terracotta. Come here, my terracotta. What do we have here? I don’t know. But I feel it will be a girl. Don’t you dare! Easy, easy, easy, you know we can’t now. You know, your mom called. And? - She's feeling ill again. She’s bored, not ill. That’s why she calls. I wish she didn't have that phone. - Vova! I’ll stop by her place tomorrow. - Better. Better get me some grub! - You only want to eat! Found yourself a cook... Missed me! Feet first. Fucking hold it straight. Are you okay? Yeah. Here, take this. Are you not gonna stay for the memorial? I have to work. And Maryna? In the hospital. Pregnancy complications. All right, I gotta run. Kisses! Kisses! Let me say something. I wanted to say that you're doing everything right, man. And everyone here supports you and will always help you. Brother, you are an example for us! We love you, Vova and Maryna! Respect, greetings, happiness, love, and prosperity! Hello. I’m sitting here, waiting. I think they have it. - It's ok. We're waiting. Ok, I’ll call. And then? - Then? The place got too small for Tucha and me. I wanted to work for myself. And he didn’t want to let me go. I can never get to fixing it. And then they blew him up. Someone did. Someone. The guys started to tear his land apart. We chopped off a piece for ourselves. Of course we contributed to the coffers. And now you're thirty... - Thirty-two. Still young. - I don’t know. Now when I think back. Everyone is either dead, or locked up. The sly ones became politicians. Just yesterday they burned people alive, and now they are all over the TV. The cops took over our business. All of my guys are gone. And me... It's like someone is protecting me. Someone must need you. Who the fuck needs me? I have done so much... crappy stuff. I’ve been doing these things for far too long. Many of us do things we shouldn’t be doing. Perhaps. But it’s important to understand why you exist in this world. Then maybe you have enough time to do as much good as possible, to cover all the stuff. And have you done any good? Rhino, maybe the ears? Yeah, maybe the ears. Maybe that will open him up. Come on, Meat! Where’s the money? Don’t be so prude! - How is it going? She clenched her teeth and is fighting back. I’m gonna look in another place. That’s enough, bro. You can’t hide much down there. So, where's the dough? I'm gonna gut him. So? I fucking give up. Where the fuck are they hiding it? The baby’s room? - Just the kid there, nothing else. I think he just pissed himself. Or what? He's done. Fucker. Is there a hallmark? Is it real or not? Don’t touch my baby, you bastard! Don’t touch the child... It's in the mattress! In the crib mattress! There. We don’t touch children. They are innocent. Let’s get going, guys. Are you nuts? Where the fuck are you going? Shit, cops! What do you want? The sheep. What? - The shepherd, herd, what’s not clear? Careful, God won’t forgive you this. - We’ll see if I forgive him. What should you forgive him? Everything he’s done to me. - And that is? What kind of life is this? It's a fine life. What's so bad? Did he do something to you? Well, you can go in there, just leave the keys, ok? Are you fucking nuts? - Come on, man. Wanna eat something? Hey, fancy hat! Gimme your cap! But please no burgers! - I like burgers. Mind if I sit here? Fuck! Is there no space? Look at all the benches. Sit down, are you kidding? Calm down, have a seat. Thanks. - You’re welcome. I'm having a good day today. - Why's that? I met some really wonderful people. And I want to tell you something. Go ahead. One word, ten bucks. Why're you laughing? - He is funny. Fucking funny. I'm not afraid. I spent seven years in prison. What for? Paragraph 93. Fraud. A grafter? Now I’m a businessman. Civilian? - But prison didn't break me. Were you a bitch in there? I’m not a fag if that’s what you're asking. I'm straight. I learned some important things there. I left as a new person. Now I understand that money isn't the most important thing. What is important? - What is important? Not to waste your life in vain. And life, life itself. I love, I’m in love. I love, I’m in love. Hallelujah, my friend, hallelujah! He who looks through my eyes is the same as the one who looks through your eyes. And I also travel. I have visited over 50 countries. I want to visit all of them. And I want to sail around the world. On your own yacht? - Yeah. Then into outer space! - Yes. Why not, they're now starting commercial flights. Now I'll have my lunch. - Take care, astronaut! You too, bandits! May I sit here? - Of course. I'm having a good day today. I've met some wonderful people. I saw Pashka yesterday. He says the cops have gathered ten books of crap on each of us. The locals won’t mess with us. They are all on a retainer. But they've sent in a prosecutor from Kyiv. He's moving all cases forward. Why the fuck are you so calm? Why fuss about it? - Fuss? They are starting to bug Noose and his guys. Everyone says it’s time to lay low. - Who? All the guys. - Well, let them lay low. No big deal. It’s not funny, Vova. They’ll lock us up if we don’t take it easy. All right, get out, take a walk. At least give me a ride home. I'm busy, here’s your stop. Go. Hi there, Plus! - Hi. Why so jumpy? - Get in. You cold? - A little. Okay, I’ll warm you up. How do you like my little fishy? You didn’t say anything. - What can I say? Don’t you know? Just say it’s pretty. Some weird shit. Why weird? It’s nice. Okay, enough - Why enough? Chill! - Why chill? Enough for today. Are you out of gas or what? Are you saving some for your wife? - None of your business. And what is my business? Sit around and wait for your call? Okay, come on! We both came on already, didn’t we? Why is she still up? - Let’s go to the bathroom. Let me hold her. What happened? At least shower after your whores! Next time I will. Wait, I’ll get the towel. What is this? - I don’t know. Who brought this? - Let me go, it hurts! I don’t know. It was stuck in the door. What do you want? It’s all good and clean. Why the fuck are we here? - They’ll lock us up! Let’s get lost instead. - Really, bro! There's still time to run. I gotta find out what they have on me. Alright, stick around. - Ok, we’ll be close by. Where do I go with this? Wait here. Vasyl Petrovych! Have a seat. Where the fuck are you going? Come in. Have you summoned me? Have a seat. It’s so sunny here. You know, in the capital, it's just sleet and slush. I can at least warm up a bit down here. Do you know why we asked you to come in? No. - No? Here’s your case. We’ve worked on your case for two years. All I have to do is to sign a warrant. Are you scared? A bit. That’s good. What an interesting thing is the calendar! If you look carefully, you can tell someone’s fortune. I can even tell yours. Look, here's how old you are now. And this is how many years will pass before you get out of here. These are sad numbers, really sad. But there is an option. There is always an option with more cheerful numbers. For example, like this. And then your life would change. Well, in fact, it would not change at all, it would remain the same. And it would not become what I can make it, with the sad numbers. And how about we make this number more cheerful and divide it by two? We are not at school. And we have nothing to divide. We have the calendar, and it is impartial. Just like me. Understood. That’s good. Here’s your contact. Don’t get out of line. I don’t like that. - Can I go? Have a nice day. Have a nice day. So, bro, what’s the deal? Not good. Hey, bro. How are you guys? Do you have any hogs to slaughter? - Fat ones? Yes. - Why? I need to take care of something. We’re crunching the numbers. Do you need cash? Let's split it in half? - Yes. I have this mule. Will he do? Alright. - 8 Lazarev St. Where? - 8 Lazarev St., door 1. Yes, we’ll drop by. Okay, turn around. - Off the bridge? Listen, Meat, the varnished one washes off better. Fucking hair! Fucking great! Plus, I’m Mowgli! No, Red, you’re no Mowgli. You’re an idiot. Andrii Borysovych? - Hello! I'm listening. It's Vova. I have the documents. Do you know where the head office is? - Yes. Come over. - All right, I’ll drop by shortly. What’s up? - Let’s go. Red, let’s go! I’m flying! - To Camelot or straight to the sauna? We drop off the dough first. - Why not screw them over or do them in? Are you stupid? Are you missing the big house? Got it. What the fuck? Stop! Hello! Stop! Rhino, phone! Fuck, it’s your Maryna. - Tell her I’m at work. Come here. Go ahead, get in. Did you gather it all? I think I did. And where’s the angle grinder? What happened? Keep going. - Any stiffs? You can’t go there. - Stop. Everything’s okay. Bro, give me a gun. Easy bro! Fuck, someone is fucking guilty! Bro, it’s just an accident. Fuck, no. It’s not. And that’s when you quit? No, it only got worse. Why? After Maryna it was a complete meltdown. I started seeing things. She started coming and talking to me, but I couldn’t understand. I started thinking about things. Am I doing the right thing? What should I be doing? You know, I think that when a person is born, there is a flower inside. That’s the soul. And the soul is pure and full of light. Then life starts trying to break it, trample it, cover it in dirt. The person must be strong, must protect it. And I started growing an armor. I grew a horn. And I stopped feeling like a human. I was like... a rhino. And now I’m afraid to look inside. Why? I think there is nothing left. All the I’s are dotted, everything’s in its place. Tomorrow’s day is like a two-word phrase, And you can amuse yourself with rhetorical questions. But at twilight a Grey shadow Inevitably crawls out from corners and cracks, Tormenting my soul with a cold verdict. Yes, I am a sated pig; yes, I am a sated pig! I am a sated pig, simply a sated pig. I lie in a dirty puddle, but don’t you touch me, This puddle is mine! Maryna! - Vova, what's wrong? What the fuck? Sit the fuck down! I also splash in the water like this on Epiphany. No way! Do you want your cock not to work? So, one more question. Skull’s raising it. There's a guy fucking with our people. Who is he? A nutcase. A fucking animal. They call him Rhino. You heard of him? Have you, Murchik? - He’s a piece of shit with no breaks. What should we do? - We should get a message out. We’re gonna make him listen. I’ve fucking had it with him. There’s no one to talk to. They lost it. Dad, I would bring twice as much from their land. This shit is nuts. Your word. We’ll act accordingly. Chicha, you’ll go with him. Let’s pour one more. We needed to swing by and pick him up. Right, at his place. Yes, yes. Oh fuck! Are you okay? Rhino? Fuck, Skull, you are a real sadist. So, hands or feet? Feet. - Your fucking call. Hold him. Yes, speaking. Fine, we’ll be there soon. What’s that? - Dad is calling. We need to go. Are you coming? - No. Your choice. We are done. The rest is your business. Let’s go. What you fucking fag, is that enough? You believed in yourself, huh? Who do you fucking think you are? Remember, fucker, Skull doesn’t forgive those who go against him. And Dad is done with you. I get to do whatever I want. What can I get from you? Piss on you and that’s fucking it. Both his arms are dislocated. A few ribs are broken, massive internal bruising. His septum is damaged and the right kidney, too. Please stay in your room. Sorry. Will he survive? - He has survived. But I would not call him healthy. You know, if he came here on his own... Good afternoon! Then... Is he conscious? - Usually yes. Any visitors? - No. Does he speak? - I don’t know. Not with me. He’ll talk to us. Please not today. He just got a sedative. Yes, fine. Are you at all planning to protect him? Why? Someone wanted to kill him so badly, they may want to finish him off. Doctor, there is no need to protect him. We need to protect others from him. You should go, don’t worry. We’ll figure it out. Are there window bars? No. Let's figure it out. I can see everything. - I have doctor's permission. Why? Why did you need this? I already lost one brother! Calm down, I’m not here for long. Come in. What happened to the door? - Your buddies were looking for you. Hi, Dima! - Hi! Take your brother for a walk. - Let’s go! I don’t want to! It’s my car! How about some food? Hello. - Hello. Can I speak to Red? This is Vova. - Be damned you!! I wish they killed you, scum, not my Yurko! Old man, is the fish taking today? - No fucking luck! Same here. But I know where they do. - Really? Carp? Worse. Your beer’s ready! Thanks. Meat, Red. They finished them all. And what about Plus? Don’t know. He disappeared. Maybe they got him. I don’t know. So tell me about those fuckers. What can I tell you... Rhino, not now. This fat guy, Chicha, is he under Dad? Everyone’s here under Dad. Rhino, what do you have on your mind? Did you do Skull in? I’ll need a gun, a thousand bucks, and a spare cartridge. Just lay low somewhere. Why don’t you get out of here? Do you think I forgave them Maryna and my daughter? It was just an accident, right? Do you think I forgot? Rhino, don’t be crazy A thousand bucks, a gun, and a spare cartridge. Tomorrow. Alright. Fine. How are you? Alive? What friend? - Your friend. This one! All is well? - Yeah... Bro, that’s a whole lot of waste paper. You read all this? - Yeah, syllable by syllable. Just as I thought. Did Dad send you here for books? Where are your buddies? Not really. I’m here by myself, don’t fret. And Dad... He got blown up last year. They've stopped looking for you. And what about you? I got shot! Listen, I have a job for you. I don’t do those jobs anymore. And what do you do? Shitters? And why not? Have you lost something? I was wondering if they had some booze. Fancied a drink. Why do you have to break it? I just want to open it. Can't you just ask? I’m asking now. - There you go. Grandpa’s stash? Want some? Plus, do you know what you live for? No, why the fuck would I. Do you? - I don’t know either. But I would like to know. I hate cognac. So... are you coming with us? Who is us? There are two guys in a car waiting. What was I supposed to drive down here alone? What if I say no? Are you gonna make me? Why would you say that? I’m just messing with you. I just need to swing by one place. Where? - Not far from here. In a forest. I gotta dig something up. A stash? Do you have a spade? We’ll just have to find an excavator! I’ll get one from grandpa. Are you gonna pack your stuff? - Just a jacket. What are you hiding for? How about that job for me? Is it not urgent anymore? Your buddies are all cold already. Don’t be scared, I won’t touch you. Forgive me, bro, I ratted you out. They forced me, bro. I didn’t have a choice. There’s always a choice. - What choice? To jump into the grave? You can jump now. - Vova, bro, don’t kill me. Please! You know why we came. You started it all yourself. I know. Hold it. Tell Dad you finished me off. Dad is dying. At the hospital. Cancer. Good. That’s it, you can go. And you? I'm already dead. I had to help my friends. We needed to dig up some potatoes. It was urgent. Good. I’ll be going soon. Please return your linens. Passengers, we are entering the city in five minutes. The toilets will be closed and remain closed until Alexandria. Right in the morning. Every day. Lord! - Quiet, granny. I do what I want. Right, baby? What are you doing there? What are you drawing? - Let the child be! She’s my child, understand? What are you doing there? Maryna! Careful! - Sorry. So, I came back. Not to my city, of course, although no one was looking for me there either. But over there, abroad, no one needs us. And here? Here we are home. You can make something of yourself. Like this, chasing after debtors? They owe money to good people. I simply help. For a fee? Why not? You know, in that shed, in that sheep pen, I was just reborn. I recognized that I don't want to live like that. I have a dream. I want to build a place where anyone would be welcome. Where I can teach people to be strong. Where they will find their true calling. You don’t believe me? You’ll see. I just need some time. What if the time ran out? - How so? Listen, those people you killed, do you see them? Those were bad people. Just like you? - Worse. And children? - What children? Children. Little humans that didn’t have the time to grow up. Enough already! Don’t you remember? In the car, she had braids. Get out! I told you, get out! I can go. But how are you going to live? I will. I’ve managed so far. Alright. Just tell me, what was it all for? Money? Where is it? Friends? Is anyone left? Maybe the family? For whose sake? Tell me, what should I do? Repent. So what, I say I repent, and everything is forgiven? I light a candle and just go on with my life? And what if I don’t want to go? Anything can be forgiven. But not everything can be forgotten. Look! Are you waiting for these two? Step aside. Don’t mess with us. You’ve got a knife. Go ahead. Hit. For Dad’s daughter. For mine. This is for Maryna. And now, bastard, for my Mom... For Red, for Meat, for Karas, for Skull, for everyone. Go ahead! Hit, don’t be a wuss. And now for me. Thanks.
