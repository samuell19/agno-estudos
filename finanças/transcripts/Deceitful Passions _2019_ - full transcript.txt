I came to have a certain hate for women like that. They were weak. I'll be back. - Hey, baby. - Camille. - I thought I... - Yeah. I thought I told you to call before you come up here.

You gave me a job when I got out, so I have your back. Plus, I don't wanna see you get hurt. And how would I get hurt? I've learned a few things about people from being locked up. Them niggas, they don't move in the same direction as you. You a good person, they not. Look, Seth is a good man, trust me, I know him. And Vito, Vito just a useless ho.

Vito is trying to act like he love his wife and they baby more than me and mine. That's because she got her arm wrapped around that nigga's neck, won't let his ass breathe. You gotta tell her that you're having his baby. Do she even know about you? She got to. Can't nobody be that stupid. Please, bitches be out dumb as fuck, believing every dumb lie. I think you should post a picture of you and Vito, tag her ass in it, and let the shit fall. You know what, she would die. Her corny ass don't post shit but plates of food and pictures of her baby. She gotta be ugly as fuck cause I ain't never seen her face. She ugly, she fat, and she got a fucked up lake spread, wonder why that nigga don't ever take her nowhere. You know what, I got a picture of V grabbing my ass on my birthday that will fuck her up. If you gonna do something, do it right. What you mean? You got better shit than pictures. You got video? As a matter of fact, I recorded him giving me head on my phone because he said she be going through his. I dare you. Fuck her! She not gonna do shit. Is your face in it?

Come on, little baby. What's up, baby? Let's go to sleep. I know you see this shit, bitch. Oh my God. What? Girl, what's this, I ain't fixing to watch porn with you. - That's nasty. - It's Vito. No it's not. What is this? Baby, this some old shit. Who is she? Nobody! It's just some bitch that me and Seth met at the strip club a few years ago. 2011. You don't look that young in that video, though. Shut up. Don't bring Seth into this. Seth would never do nothing like this. Seth is who I should've married. What the fuck you just say to me?

Nah, man. You fucking Seth? - What, no! - Is that what the fuck this is about? I'm gonna kill this nigga. No, I have not done anything with Seth. Are you kidding? I was just mad. Look, I am sorry. You really falling for this right now? Angie, what the fuck is you doing here anyway? Trying to break up my family? No, I'm here because your wife called me and help pack her stuff up. Trust me, I'd rather be at home in my bed comfortable. Look, if you wanna leave, you can go. Leave with Angie. I don't wanna leave. I want my family. Bye, Angie. Bye, dog. Don't call me next time he get loose. What? When God blesses you with a family as beautiful as mine, you don't let nothing ratchet and wicked destroy it. Hashtag, he married me. Hashtag, go back to the strip club? Hashtag, wife versus trash? Hello? Why the fuck you post that old ass video? Oh, that was like a month ago. Man, whatever, that shit didn't work. Well, she can't pretend she don't know what's up. She know what I tell her. You ain't shit, Vito. Just look, I been thinking. You know, we need to finish that conversation from the other day, and I wanna see you. Ooh, can't it be after my hair appointment? I mean, oh, and can we go to my favorite spot? You know, that one spot. Wherever you wanna go. Oh, but look, it gotta be today. Okay. All right, I'll see you in a minute. Yeah, all right, my baby, later. Why you keep playing, Vito?

Damn, bae, calm down. I'll be fine. I'm not trying to stress you out. You want some more eggs, baby? Nah, nah, nah, look, look, I'm sorry for snapping on you like that, all right?

So the last thing I need is another bitch. My bad, I'm sorry. It's just the last thing I need right now. Sorry, Tony, I won't bring it up again. Look, my money gonna be good real soon, okay? In fact, I gotta call my mans. I gotta go. You gotta go to work? You sure you don't wanna finish these eggs, bae? Look at your greedy ass. I mean, I am eating for two, and we couldn't wait for you, babe. Camille, Camille, Camille. You know, you a piece of work, woman. You got more than enough time to have a baby. You so young. Ain't no need to rush. Don't you want a family of your own, a husband, you know, somebody that's gonna love you like I love Brittany. Love like Brittany? That's not love. Why would I want that? Okay, so, are you coming home with me after... Get the fuck outta here, man! I'm not about to play these games with you. It's over. I don't give a fuck what you do with that baby. V, chill. No, fuck that. You out here running and screaming saying you love me, but if you loved me, you wouldn't be trying to fuck up my life, so guess what, I don't give a fuck no more. It's over. Is this about your wife? I mean, the video was old. Is she okay? Like you give a fuck about her feelings. Whether you like it or not, Brittany is my wife, and we already got a kid. So if you're smart, you'll get rid of that baby cause I'm not getting rid of my wife. No man ever loved like I love Brittany. There go $500. I don't give a fuck what you do with this money, but you dead to me, so you make sure you stay the fuck out of my life. Bitch. What's up, baby? You need some help or something? No, I got it, it's just a couple bags anyway. Oh, okay. Where you been all day? Oh, just out and about. You know, I called you a few times and you ain't picked up. Yeah, I broke my phone. How you manage to do that? You know, I dropped it again. Let me guess, it's mango, huh? Actually, no. I was in the mood for something else. So you just gonna walk away from me when I'm talking to you? So you just gonna walk away from me when I'm talking to you? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were still talking. You gonna watch TV? Yep. You know, this is what I do every night. You ain't gotta stay, though. I mean, I know you wanna go be with your boys. Nah, I wanna chill at the crib with my wife, order up some pizza, and watch a movie. What? Yeah. So you staying? I'm staying. Like, all night? All night. Okay, well, I'm not watching Street Dog Wars. Housewives? No. All right, how about Wait? Okay. How about we get some pineapples on that pizza? All right, only on your half, though. Get the fuck out! So, you mean to tell me that you just let the motherfucker just leave the restaurant? He got you fucked up. That couldn't have been me. Bitch, you stupid. I would've clowned his ass right then and there. He threw the money? He might as well have spit in your face. I don't know what to do. Girl, sitting here crying ain't gonna get you nowhere. And I don't know why you messing with a married man anyway. You know they never leave their wives. Shut up, Karmisha, and stop acting like you ain't never did it. As I recall, you had to scrape up your own abortion money. Shit, don't you still owe me from that? Oh my God, come on, y'all like, help me, shit, what am I gonna do? Well, Karmisha was part right. They never leave their wives, but their wives do leave them. She saw the sex tape and she still stayed. She dumb as fuck. Who said we was done with her? Y'all dumb hos wanna hold on to niggas that don't want you. Now you crying in the street, looking stupid. Do you need a ride to work, boo boo, cause that car ain't going nowhere. Nowhere. Girl, okay, come on, let's go before he catch us out here. You going back home? Oh, no, that is the first place that he is going to look and find me. I'm gonna just go to my friend house. Other friend? Yeah, Vito ain't the only nigga I got. I just know Vito is gonna tell Tony. Whatever you do, I wasn't here. That nigga will kill me if he find out I tried some shit like this on him. All right. What's up, baby? Ready? You got bitches fucking up my car now? - What? - That's how you feel, nigga? I'm sick of your shit. I'm going to get my baby from your mama. She better not say shit to me about leaving your ass. Well I don't know how the fuck you're gonna get there. You ain't taking my car. I don't need your fucking car, nigga. I'll take an Uber. Move! Brittany! Brittany! Man! What the fuck is she doing? This dumb bitch, man. Yeah, I'm staying over there tonight. Yeah, I just came to grab a few stuff. Girl, don't tell Karmisha shit. She should've been with us. Mm hmm, no, you should've seen the look on that bitch face when she see her car, though! And it got like 5,000 views. Niggas love drama. All right, okay, all right, girl. I'm just, yeah, I'm good, I'm just about to grab some stuff and I'll be on, my friend waiting on me. All right, bye. Wake up, bitch. Fuck you, Vito. So you wanna keep playing these weak-ass games with me, huh? No, it was Sasha, I didn't do it! She had my phone last night! And she did it, I promise, I didn't have anything. Oh, no. I didn't do it, I'm... Bitch, shut the fuck up! All you do is lie. Vito, I promise. Fuck that weak-ass shit. You didn't wanna go get an abortion yourself, so I'm gonna give you one for free. I'm gonna kill you and that motherfucking baby. Vito, no, you'll go to jail if you kill me. Please, I'm not worth it! You wanna beg? You wanna beg? I begged your ass to get an abortion! - Please... - No! It's time to go, shut the fuck up! I told you, you dumb bitch! I told you, I told you! Dumb bitch! Baby, what happened? I called Vito over to tell him that I was leaving him. Take your time. And he lost it. I've never seen him act like that before. He was crazy. He attacked me. What? So what about the baby? I told him that it was yours, and that I wanted to be with you. Then you killed our baby, Seth. And now, the doctors are saying I may not be able to have kids. He killed our baby. Okay, all right, listen. Okay. I'm gonna fill your whole room up with flowers, all right? Then when it's time for you to get outta here, I'm gonna take you back to my house, and I'm gonna take care of you. And Vito, I'm gonna make sure that he don't never, I'll make sure he don't ever hurt you again, okay? So what this scandalous bitch up to now? She lost her baby. What, how? Vito beat her up real bad. She lost the baby. That nigga know she was knocked up? Mm hmm, sure did. This nigga put his hands on your family? What you gonna do, dog? I'm gonna kill him. You in? I ain't going to jail for you, man. So you better have a good-ass plan. I do. That's good. What, Vito? Nigga, I don't know. Okay, did you check with your mom? Well, I guess that explains why she not over there. Did you try your cousin Philip? She likes him. No, she's not. I mean, she was for a couple of days, but she left when I was at work, so I don't know where she is. Brittany has A-1 credit, okay? She could've got a move-in special somewhere. No, she didn't. Look, she just needed some time to cool off. She not about to let her child starve. You know her better than that. Look, I got you, Vito, all right? You know I care about your family. Look, just give her some time to calm down, and she'll come around, all right? And if I hear anything, I'll let you know, all right? It's cool. All right. Girl, you lucky little Vince didn't wake up, all right? He would've messed my cover up for real. I don't know. Ut seemed like he was so concerned. I should probably call him. - Just so he can know we okay. - Girl, no. Girl, let that nigga sweat. He ain't gonna die! Look, I miss our house, I miss him, I miss us. Look, I can't even listen to his messages without crying. Okay, why is it that every good female is always crying over a weak-ass nigga? I mean, I could see if he was good and treating you right, but this nigga made a sex tape! - It was old. - No, it wasn't! Girl, you need to wake up. Whenever you wanna reminisce and dream about all the good old times, you need to remember this ho shit instead. Well that's easier said than done. What you need to do is move on. Like date? Yes. Girl, it's been three weeks. Okay, and how much time do you need? Girl, I bet he out there dating. No, I can't, that's not right. Listen, the best way to get over one nigga is to get up under another, okay? Girl, in fact, Angie got the perfect dude for you right now. He sweet, he got a good-ass paying job. Girl, the perfect rebound. Rebound? Yes, rebound. I mean, look, I'm not telling you to fall in love with him or nothing, but you can fall in lust. Girl, it has remarkable healing powers. Look, I'm just saying, you might end up with Vito later on, who knows, but, in the meantime, while you're getting your life together and figuring that out, you need something to do, and by something, I mean someone. I don't know, girl. Just call him. Talk, if you feeling him, go out. If you're not, then hang up. Okay. So you gonna call him? Yes, I'm gonna call him. Good. Girl, it's about time you had a good man in your life. Shut up. Oh, hey, you must be Brittany. And you must be Tony. You can tell by the outfit? Yeah, that was it. Um, you seem nervous. You date a lot? Actually, this is my first date since my marriage ended. Damn. You gonna need a drink. Definitely. So, um, tell me more about yourself. I mean, what can I say? The business just didn't work out. And the vultures smelled blood in the water and, before you know it, my business in foreclosure, and I was back to making my living on the street. Well, you seem to be handling it well. You want a cheese stick? Nah, I'm good. I mean, I really ain't got no choice. I mean, I got two kids looking at me to make good. It's been a rough-ass year, but I think I made enough money to get from all this debt. Hold on, you say you got two kids? Let me see pictures, I love kids. Should be in here somewhere. There they go. Oh my God, they're so cute. They look just like you. I get that a lot. I only have one, but I'd like to have 10 more if I could. 10? Yeah. I would just focus on this one you got. Let me see a picture. Let me see. I gotta get some new pictures. He look like such a baby in all these pictures. Ain't nothing wrong with that. Oh, here we go. Oh, his weak-ass daddy is in this one, though. Hey, come on now, don't be baby daddy bashing. What? Um, nothing, nothing, just little man looks so much like you. You think so? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's so crazy because everybody says he looks like Vito. Who? Oh, just my ex, nobody. Oh. Okay, so, what do you like to do for fun? You know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Shit, nigga, you bullshitting. You mean to tell me this nigga going crazy looking for his wife and you damn near fucking her? Man, that's some funny shit. Shit, I guess we got a way in now. He ain't even gonna see it coming. Shit, nigga, I ain't trying to stand in your way of getting that shit unless you gonna give me a turn. Yeah, nigga, whatever, real funny, ha ha. Look, man, I'm at the crib, man. I'm about to go in and kick it, all right. I'll holler at you later, though. All right, peace. Nigga wild, boy, I tell you. Hey. What's wrong? I was lonely. You left me alone for hours. I know, I know, I'm sorry, but I'm here now, I mean, unless you want me to run back out and get you something. I mean, did you eat? Yeah, I'm fine, it's just that... It's just that what? Listen, man, I know you're tired of being cooped up in the house, I get it. I don't really think Vito need to know where you at just yet. All right, but I'm gonna take you shopping soon, get you out of the house, let you get some air. I'm just tired of feeling like nothing is ever going to happen to Vito after everything he did to me and our baby. I'm just feeling like I'm not ever gonna get justice. Now why you gonna say something like that, man? Anyway, I got some real important intel about that too, by the way. Intel, what? If you scared to do something, just say so. We can pay somebody to fuck him up. There you go with that scared shit again. Ain't nobody scared of that nigga but your ass. You act like that nigga don't bleed just like everybody else. I'm trying to lay low and let this shit die down and let your ass lay low, too. At the end of the day, we got to be cerebral about this shit. I'm telling you, man, you better learn some shit about real beef, little girl. What, why are you so mad? I ain't really mad. I don't give a fuck. But you talking crazy. Fine, okay.

Vito! - What? - Sit down! You pacing back and forthing is making me nervous. Where the fuck can she be? You and I had a deal. I know, all right. When me and you were together, it's no talking about my husband and damn sure no talking about your wife, neither. I know! You're right. - It's just... - And it's just what? She ain't never been gone this damn long. She may dip out to her cousin house a few times, but she been gone a whole month! She finally sick of your ass, huh? Yo, this shit ain't funny, Glo. Yes the fuck it is. Now, you been pacing back and forth in this house for the last two weeks feeling sorry for yourself. You done had this girl mind for years, and her heart. What, she got your mind now, and you can't handle the control? I'm glad you think my pain is funny. Boy, bye. You deserve every bit of what's happening to you. I'm laughing at you, and I hope somebody else in this world is laughing at my dumb-ass husband, too, cause he can't handle it, neither, the control. So you think Brittany fucking another nigga? Well, when me and Tony broke up for that month, you have to think about how much sex you and I were having before he even left. Baby, y'all gonna be all right. She gonna take you back, but look, dummy, you just make sure you don't fuck it up this time. Yeah, you right. She gonna take a nigga back for sure. Vito, you a mess, but I gotta go, and, look, the boys about to get home from school. If you leave, please put the alarm on. Nobody has time for them coming up in here, shooting us all. What? Ain't nobody think about no weak-ass Tony. Do what I asked you to do, okay? - All right. - All right. I'll see you later, baby. You know, I know it's only been a few weeks, but this is going really well. I know, I'm gonna have to start listening to my cousin. Yeah, Angie knows best. She said I needed a rebound, but I don't know, you might be more. Oh really? Like what? Like a friend. That's cool for now, but once your divorce is final, and my bread back up, I might propose to you. Really? You propose? I'm sorry. The fuck? What's wrong? Angie, she was supposed to watch Vince for me tomorrow but she says she can't now. Damn, can't you just leave out early or something? No, I only just went back to work after my leave, and I just asked for a transfer. Like, I gotta chill for a minute. Yeah, that's real. Look, how about this? How about I watch the little fella? We stay here til you come back. You would do that? Of course. We friends, ain't we? I don't know. I mean, yeah, it might be too soon to be asking them kind of favors. I am still married, and if Vito knew you had his son, he would die. You know, I can understand that. I'd be the same way if my wife had some nigga around my kids. See? But, at the same time, you gotta do what you gotta do, and quite frankly, I'm here for you. Where he at? There ain't no dissing baby daddies, remember? You're right, you're right. But you right, and I appreciate that. You can thank me tomorrow. You know exactly what I like. Nigga, I do not know. Damn, I ain't even know what I like. Let me go get you a piece. Girl, bye. Well, hello, I wasn't expecting to see you here, eating, again. Girl, let me call you right back, okay? All right, bye. Hi, cousin. Hey. I know you happy to see me, right? I'm always happy to see you, except why are you here instead of at school studying? I promise you I'm not going to waste you or my daddy's money, okay? I just came here to eat and to use your free Internet. Look to me like you was just talking on the phone. Yeah, that was my girl Camille. She is straight wilding on these dudes, okay, playing them like spades, running Bostons. Who is crazy Camille running like Bostons. This nigga named Seth. He got a whole lotta money, and she is running him like a chump. He cannot be that stupid. Okay, start from the top. Well, I mean, she met him when she was still stripping. Hey, baby. Damn, girl, what happened to you? I just saw you a couple days ago. You was straight. Still straight, just tripped trying to chase the mailman. It's just a sprain, though. Nah, that got to be serious cause you ain't up in the salon getting no money, cause I ain't never known a little pain to stop you from getting it. Nah, the shop is good. I got Shanika and Charles holding it down for me. Okay. Shanika will take care of my clients and Charles will lock up tonight, fix whatever need to be fixing. Okay. But, shit, if I'd have knew this was what it was gonna take to get you over here, I'd have took this fall a long time ago. You better stop playing with me. Now you know I love you and all, plus can't nobody cook like you. I made you a plate in there. I'm gonna just go ahead and have a seat. All right, cool, I'm gonna go grab it. Hey, you know what? I been meaning to get by here, but I just been really busy. You know how that go. Busy, with what, Camille? Man, goddamn, I swear your ass be knowing everything. I do run a beauty shop, remember? Nah, nah, nah, go on and tell your girl how much in love you is. Now come on, bro, it ain't anything like that, man. Kitty know me better than anybody, man. She know I just be trying to look out for people. But what does she need looking out for? All right, look, man, I got her pregnant, all right? And when V did what he did, he made her lose the baby. Vito, why was Vito with your girl? Now, see, I can answer that one. Man, I can talk for myself, man, damn! Look, man, me and V met her at the same time. She was dancing up in the club. So, initially, we both was fucking her. She started liking me a little more than him, he didn't like it, shit went left, here we are. That don't even sound right. Vito is not the type of nigga to get attached to a girl. Yeah, well he got attached to her. You do know I know this chick, right? How? She be with my cousin sometimes. So what that mean? You know her better than I do? Nah, but I definitely know her type, and that ho, that ho ain't right. Shit, that baby probably wasn't even yours. Probably told Vito the same shit, and that's probably why he was tripping. I mean, that nigga got a wife. Think about that shit. He got a lot to lose. Nah, mm mm, Vito ain't shit, but y'all been friends a long time. Would he really fall out with you behind some pussy? Now you got one thing right, that nigga ain't shit. And regardless of what him and Camille had going on, that ain't his wife, so he ain't had no business putting his hands on her. Right, cause if it was his wife, then it would've been all right. You know, you really need to stop listening to everything you hear at the beauty shop, little mama. I'm just saying, Seth has let that nigga know, it ain't cool to come between a man and what's his. Wait a minute, we talking about him or we talking about you? What you think? Look, man, we gotta shoot some moves, we gotta get up outta here. Listen, I'm gonna take a rain check on the dinner, but I'm gonna go grab that plate out the kitchen. All right, baby, well you know you welcome anytime, handsome. Think about what I said, though. Watch yourself. All right, thanks. Damn, man, you got this bitch laying live like a motherfucker. Where the fuck is you going, nigga? The door right here. Nigga, I'm going to get my fucking plate, man. ♪ Ring around the rosy ♪ ♪ Pocket full of poesy ♪ ♪ Ashes, ashes ♪ ♪ We all ♪ ♪ Fall ♪ ♪ Dead ♪ What the hell is this? Who the fuck is you talking to?

I'm gonna put it to you like this, bro. I knew you was going be on some bullshit, so I took her baby. You took her baby? You took her baby where? Chill, man. He at my little jump off house. Like a kidnap? You wild as hell, Tony. Dog, I know she ain't let you just take the baby. You put your hands on her? Man, no. Now look, she gave me a spare key. I went in last night while she was sleeping. Ain't nobody gonna do nothing to that little nigga, dog. Man, look, I'm a father, you think I just hurt kids? And besides, man, now we got leverage. Leverage? What the fuck we need leverage for? Money! Why not? We plotting, right? We may as well get some bread. Dog, he ain't got no money, not no ransom money. What you want from him, like $500, some yays? Want you want, his car? That's what he got. I mean, he used to break me off. Why you think I was the one paying all your bills and not him? Man, y'all dumb as fuck, man. Hey, man, I ain't doing shit for free. For free? 15 racks, remember? I told you, I got you. And when the fuck this become a ransom anyway? We was just supposed to catch him and just fuck him up, man. We just gonna break his legs or some shit like that? Yeah! Man, no the fuck you didn't, man! Stop lying to yourself. You knew what the fuck this was from jump. Now you just too damn scared to pull the trigger. Seth, you getting soft. This man killed our baby and put me in the hospital. You said you loved me, right? Then stop acting scared and do something about it. See there you go with that scared shit again. Ain't nobody scared. What y'all seem to forget, this is my best friend. Like, I grew up with him. I know his mama. How I supposed to look her in the face we done kidnapped her grandson? Come on, dog. Well, your best friend didn't care when he stuck that hanger inside of me. Man, whatever, man, what's the plan, man? Well if you sure we can't get no money out of him, why don't we just use the baby to lure him in? Yeah, whatever, long as my nephew safe, I don't care. That little nigga will be all right. Goodness, man, this thing outta hand. Do you have any idea of who would've done this? No, no! And he is such a sweet baby. And I don't have him around anybody, just my cousin and Vito's mother. Who would do this? Look, we're gonna do everything we can to get him back. Officers are here right now, dusting to see if the perp left prints. It's a long shot. This seemed planned. What? But maybe somebody made a mistake. - Oh my God. - Okay? We'll keep in touch. Sarge. Oh my God. Here, sweetie, I made you some tea. I put a little something in it to help you relax, okay? Thanks, Ma. All right, baby, you need anything? No, Ma, I'm all right, thank you. Okay. Vito. Yes, baby? Do you know who did this? Of course not, Britt. Did that girl do this? Nobody even knew where you were. It's just some crazy shit. I don't get it. I don't bother anybody. I know, baby, I know. I don't do anything to anybody. - But you... - Baby, come on, Britt. Come on now, we can't be at each other like that, not right now. Look, I gotta be strong for you just like you gotta be strong for me. Baby, we're gonna get our son back. On my life. Come on, you need to go lay down. Hello. Baby, are you okay? What's going on? Man, it's all bad. Somebody done came in and took my little man. Walked right in? I don't know, you think it could be Camille? You know, she was fucked up the last time I broke up with her dumb ass. Do you think she crazy like that? Hand That Rocks The Cradle crazy? I don't even know what to think. I ain't beefing with nobody. Who coulda did this shit? Maybe it's just some random unstable person. Look, I'm gonna call you back. Phillip just walked up on me. - Man, what's up, man? - What's up, dog? What the fuck happened? I don't know, man, I think it's Camille. Want some payback shit. Camille, man? - Yeah. - I didn't think she had this shit in her, bro. Wait, where Seth at?

Seth is my mans, and he wouldn't do a damn thing to hurt me or Brittany. He like family. Family? Nigga, your family right here. Phillip, you got something to say? Then spit that shit out. Dog, I already told you, my man say he seen Seth and Camille last week, twice. Man, if that nigga wanted that broad, all he had to do was open up his mouth. I don't give a fuck about these hos. Plus I asked this nigga and that bitch, and they both told me it wasn't true. So wait, you got a lying-ass bitch and a lying-ass nigga, and you just gonna believe them both, huh? Listen to me, man, you go fucking with her baby and then yours come up missing? And now this nigga not even here? Come on, man, you gotta see this shit.

Girl, ain't nobody about to do this with you. You are literally crying over a lame. All right, that's petty as fuck. I don't cry over niggas. The last one I had wanted to fuck me up because I left him, and Seth, shit, he kidnapping niggas over this pussy. Hello, Karmisha? Did you hear what I said?

Nigga, hurt your family? Nah, nah, V, this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna continue to fuck your wife. Fuck you. Then I'm gonna be a father to that boy. You know, kinda how you did mines?

Nigga not gonna remember none of this shit! You got that bag? - Where the fuck is you going? - Let go of me, man! I'm taking him back home to his mama. You must wanna go to jail. I don't give a fuck about that! Nigga, I do! Now run that bag, unless you wanna die, too. Now get the fuck up outta here. I'm gonna make sure that little nigga get home safe. Besides, you trust me, right? Man, you fucking tripping. You fucking tripping! Brittany. Brittany. Brittany, wake up. Tony, what are you doing here? Where's Vito? Man, I don't know. I ain't heard from you, I came to check on you. Your door's wide open so I came in. Oh my God, somebody took my baby. What? But he in there. What? Yeah, he in there. In where? Look, look, that's what I was trying to tell you. I ain't heard from you in so long. I came to check on you. Your door was wide open so I came in. But I noticed there's blood on the baby's face, but it's not his, I already checked. He ain't hurt. What is happening? Where is Vito? Man, why was he even here anyway? I thought you said you was done with dude. Is that why I ain't been hearing from you? Look, somebody took my baby, okay? He was kidnapped. When I went to sleep, Vito, he was here with me. Now today baby Vince is here and Vito is gone. Wait, wait, wait, kidnapped? Oh my God, man, who would do such a thing? Look, I'm sorry you had to go through this. I mean, we should clean him up. No, no, look, I work at the hospital. I know the police, they're gonna want samples of this blood. You already got the police involved. Good. You don't think that's Vito's blood, do you? What, no, do not say that. Wait a minute. No, I know this chain. This is Seth's chain. Wait, wait, Seth, who is Seth? Vito's best friend. Why, why would baby Vince have his chain? Do you think this is his blood? You don't think Seth hurt Vito, do you? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what to think! Calm down. Now call the detective, and let the police do they job. But when they get here, I can't be here. What, no, where are you going? Don't leave me, don't leave me. No, listen, listen, listen, you know I'm a street nigga. I can't be fucking with no cops. I understand. Look, I don't want you to get in no trouble, but what if they wanna talk to you about the door or about anything? Look, if you want me to stay, I'll stay, but I'm your boyfriend, in your apartment, with blood on my shirt that's either your husband's or his best friend's. I don't see how me getting caught up in this is going to help anything. I came over here because I care about you, but the police, they may not look at it that way. Yeah, you should probably get rid of that shirt, too. Thanks for understanding. I really hope you find Vito and everything is all right. I truly do. I'll call you. Okay. You been taking this? Don't have to. It's a little early for that, don't you think? After what happened, it's the right time. Look, man, yesterday was hard on me and you. The best thing we can do right now is to move on, act like nothing happened. Be normal. - Normal? - Yeah. I mean, his number ain't been on your records in forever. I mean, he called me a few times yesterday, but shit, I run three businesses, so I didn't have a chance to give him a call back, so I don't know what the fuck going on. But he's gone, Seth? Like, how do we pretend, like, that he's not? So tell us right now about the feelings you obviously still got for him. But just understand one thing, Camille, Vito dead right now cause you wanted it. Don't do nothing stupid today, man. It got to be business as usual. I'm gonna go to work, you go sit at home and watch TV. And if you need absolutely anything whatsoever, do not fucking text my phone. You call me, all right? Get yourself together, man. I'll see you later. I can't be playing with you today, little girl. I got stuff to do. Come on, me and Sasha about to go to lunch, and I'm about to call Camille and see if she wanna come, too. She got all the details. I really don't even feel like being bothered with you and your little friends today. Y'all be doing too much. Stop being old. Hello. I thought you was gonna call me back yesterday. What's up, you wanna go to lunch with us? Huh? You okay, girl? What blood, what are you talking about? Are you talking about Vito? What are you gonna do? Okay, well, I'm about to come over. Okay, just don't do nothing crazy. Hello? She just hung up on me, what the fuck? Stay out of this, Karmisha. I don't want you to get hurt. It's gonna be more than one before it's all said and done. It'll be two or three more. Look, I been living in this city my whole life. Just promise me you'll stay out of it. Promise me! I promise. Take me home. I gotta go to work. And keep your mouth shut. Yo, Seth! Where you at, nigga? Seth! Hey, who that? It's me, nigga. What's popping, man? Shit busy as hell around this bitch since we down a man now. You funny as a motherfucker today, huh? It's all good, though. I ain't want shit. I just came by to make sure your soft-ass is all right. Man. Yo, what's up, Kitty, let me call you back. Hold on, wait, what? Nah, you all right? Okay, all right, look, look, listen, calm down, I'm gonna be there in a minute, all right? Just sit tight. Yeah, all right. Fuck, man! Man, it's good, nigga, we straight? I sure hope so. Listen, man, I don't know how much more of this shit I can take, man. I gotta go. All right, come on, I'm coming too, nigga, come on. Nigga, come the fuck on! You just crying and shit. Right. - Hi. - Hey, what's going on? You should've came by yourself. This is serious. By hisself? I'm family. Nah, you ain't my family. Look, Seth, I need to talk to you, alone. Man, hold the fuck up. What the fuck is your problem? Why the fuck you hate me so much? I ain't never did shit to you. You barely even fucking know me. Nah, but I know your type, and it's trouble. Hey, yo, you got something to eat? Cause I'm hungry. Nah, I ain't got nothing to eat! I didn't call you over here to kick it! Okay, I get it. You just wanted some emergency dick, huh? Yo, why you ain't tell me, dog? Go ahead, smash her, I can wait in the car. Would you shut your stupid ass up? Kitty, what's the big emergency? Why you call me over here like that? Is it true? Is Vito dead? Why you asking me that? Man, I told you that girl wasn't worth it. Now she about to get you locked up. Man, that crazy bitch is lying. Ain't nobody even seen that nigga. Man, Seth, this not like you. But you keeping really bad company, and if somebody did do something to Vito, they need to turn theyself in. Look, man, I'm gonna holler at her and see what the fuck she talking about, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. Man, you know Camille love a lot of attention, man. I just pray my man all right cause I know Brittany going crazy. Yeah, me too. But if Vito is dead, then his wife deserves to bury him properly. Listen, like I said, man, Vito a wild boy. You know how he do. He probably just laid up with a bitch or something. Listen, man, I gotta get back to work, all right? I'll see you around. You know, next he come through, you should have some food. That's the only reason he come through. You ain't got shit else. Would you get the fuck out? Man, I told you from jump, nigga, I ain't going to jail. Nigga, I done already told you, man, Camille just as deep in this shit as we is. And Kitty, that's my girl, nigga. She ain't gonna say shit to nobody. Yeah, I hope so, cause if she go to the cops, she ain't safe, your businesses ain't safe. Oh yeah, Vito got a wife that's still breathing. She ain't safe. And that crazy bitch you fucking, oh yeah, she for sure ain't safe. You know, you might as well just move out of state cause, nigga, you ain't safe. Nigga, is that a fucking threat? No, it's the fucking truth. You think this shit is a game. Ain't nobody playing but you. Look, I done already told you, bro, ain't nobody going to the fucking police. You over-thinking this shit, man. Yeah, we'll see about that. Bitch. The driver's license has him identified as a Mr. Vincent Tate. Is this the guy? Yep, that's him. So what do you think the odds are that this is the same blood that was on that baby? Good question. But what I can't understand is his small footprints around the body and a lot of fluid. We have to test that fluid to see if it match the boy. Okay, good, so now we gotta figure out how that baby got here and how Vito knew to come. Right. We got four different footprints from adult men. We got one form the vagrant who found the body, one from Mr. Tate himself, and two unknown. Well, that's interesting because the wife did mention a friend. Let's go find out what size shoe he wears. What the fuck? Do you like to do shit to piss me off? Or are you just that dumb? What are you talking about? You drunk? Is that what happened, you dumb bitch? What the fuck is wrong with you? You done told Karmisha everything! The one thing I told you not to do. No, I didn't. - Maybe Tony told Sasha. - Fat Tony ain't told nobody shit! Okay, okay. And as a matter of fact, that nigga told me if I don't fix this shit, we all dead! Oh, jail looking real good right now, though, ain't it? I didn't do anything, I promise, I didn't. You know what, when I get back, - I want you gone. - What? I don't care where you go. I don't have many oney. Understand this, you better take some of that motherfucking shit back that I bought you, stop at the pawn shop on the way out of town, and when I get back, if I see your face again, I'll kill your ass myself. Seth Matthews? Yeah. Does this belong to you? Yeah, how'd y'all get it? It was evidence from a crime scene. Do you know a Mr. Vincent Tate? Vito dead? Yeah, he is. But I believe that you already knew that. Are those the shoes you wore yesterday? Yeah. Good, we need 'em. - What? - Come on, book him. Sir, you under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. This is some fucking bullshit, man. Anything you say. Oh my God. That bitch Karmisha! You dumb ass ho! What? Bitch, when I fucking see you, it's on sight, flat! What? Mrs. Tate? We found your husband. - I regret... - No, no! - No, no, no, no! - I'm so sorry for your loss. Why, why, why? I knew this bitch was lying. Wake up, bitch. The fuck? Yeah, you want it, right? No, fuck, didn't I tell you to leave it? Bitch! Oh God, oh God, oh God, no, no, no! Oh God! I told you. Get off of me! I told you to keep your fucking mouth shut. Get off me! I told you to keep your mouth shut! Let go, let go. Well, well, well. Look what we have here. Guess you like him, after all. Hey. How are you? I'm good. Appreciate it. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - It's good. What's going on? Seth, what can we say? It is what it is. How are you? I mean, I'm good. They believe me about that bitch, so. We know you were locked up, so we took up a collection to pay for the funeral. Yeah. Oh, that's what's up. V family gonna really appreciate that. V? Kitty. - What you mean Kitty? - We just glad you got out in time to make it to the funeral. You mean Kitty gone? We thought you knew. No, I didn't know, man, come on, man, don't tell me that. Come on. Fuck! I'm so sorry. Don't tell me that, man. - God! - I'm sorry. He didn't know. He taking it pretty hard. Kitty was in love with him and he knew it. He used her to run his business and feed him. I don't feel sorry for his ho ass. Damn, Charles! He might not have been in love with her but he did care about her. And we all feel bad about what happened to her. But not everybody feel guilty. You know something. Oh, shit! Bitch, man! I hope your ass left town cause when I see you, I'm gonna finish what Vito started. Fuck! What's good, my nigga? What up, dog? Shit, chilling, man. You heard they let your boy out? They let that nigga out? You know what I mean. What you gonna do? Man, don't worry about all that shit, man. You got my money? I ain't shorted you yet. You need to let me go on ahead and handle that.

It's just I can't eat, I can't sleep. The pills, they help me. I been going to counseling at the church. Phillip's been taking me. They also have counseling for substance abuse.

You know, Seth, it's times like these we really need to come together, and we really gotta support each other. I feel you, man, it's just, she was just such a good girl, you know what I'm saying? And whatever that bullshit was that she was caught up in, I know it didn't have nothing to do with her. I think Charles saw something. Our Charles? - Yeah. - What you think he saw? I don't know, he adored Kitty. And when he got out of jail, she looked out for him. He used to ride past her house to make sure she was good. Really? And I know this because Kitty told me. She thought it was so cute that he was trying to protect her. I just feel like he saw something. You know, wait, I'm gonna holler at him. He should be pulling up in a minute. Coming to you live from Detroit's west side. 32-year-old male Seth Matthews was gunned down this afternoon outside of a local business. Police are still speaking with witnesses as the investigation continues for any possible suspects. This story will update tonight at 10. Good morning, saints. Good morning, Pastor. This morning, I want to touch you on the term deceitful, guilty, or involving deceit, misleading or being deceitful, untrustworthy, two-faced, and dishonest. Now I know, people out there in my congregation, it's probably there were individuals that's been deceitful or misleading. I know before I became a pastor, I was the one being deceitful. I was the one misleading and running amuck. But, Lord, Lord delivered me. He turned my life around. He changed me to the guy I am today. But understand this, before you turn your life around, you have to give yourself to God, you have to be willing to turn your life around. If you don't, they'll be burying you six feet deep, or you might get someone else killed for misleading them to an unknown past. But, you know, last night, as I'm contemplating what I want to talk about today to my beautiful people out there, I ran across a scripture, Psalms 43:1. It says, vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation, rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked. Now, everybody, you look at your person next to you right now. Grab they hand. You feel that warm hand? That body, that body of God. Right now, before I let you guys go, I want you all to bow your heads. Looks like you could use a friend. What's wrong? Everything okay? I don't belong here. What's going on? I've done too much. I feel like God hates me. Listen, God loves us. He loves us so much more than we could love ourselves, more than we could love one another. Come on, let's go back upstairs. It's gonna be okay, come on. Look, I came here at my lowest. My husband had just died. I didn't feel like God loved me, either. But I been going to counseling here, and the pastor, he is so nice. I been doing a lot better. You just gotta take it one day at a time. Okay. Okay, come on. Tony. Why are my kids not here? Every time I come to see them, you got them hiding. I'm not hiding them. They just staying with my mother for a while. Why? Look, after you killed Vito, I knew it was only a matter of time before you come for me. Gloria, you're my wife. I'd rather be your widow. You know you'd have to kill me, right? You came to kill me. I came to make this right. Nah, you came to silence me. You done got yourself in way too deep, and now you trying to get yourself out. First, it was just scamming and some money, but I know you would do whatever it takes to get out. Remember how we met? Yeah, I remember. I was 16, and I was sneaking out the house to go see a Dru Hill concert, and when I got off the bus, you was beating up a little boy for his shoes and for some tickets. I really wanted to go to that concert. Yeah, and everybody know when you really want something, you take it. You liked me. No, I just thought you was exciting. I ain't changed. I have. Gloria, you know what's about to happen, right? Yeah, I do. You violating your restraining orders, and it's within my rights to protect myself. ♪ I couldn't seem to follow ♪ Hey. Look, today, you need a friend, huh? Look, whatever it is, whatever you're going through, we can get through it together, okay? I'm not gonna leave you. Look, the pastor said it would be good days and it would be bad days, so today is a bad day, but tomorrow will be better. One day at a time, right? Do you stay far or close? Like, my car is right here. I will take you home. I just stay round the street. Okay, come on. The first day I came to church was the worst day of my life. I wasn't sure that I even wanted to live. My whole life, I had been searching for something. I don't know, maybe love. If you hadn't have stopped and talked to me that day, I don't think I would've made it. You just seemed like a really nice person, and you understood me. I was sleeping with two men, and I got pregnant, and I told them they were both the father, when, truth is, I had no idea. And you were just so nice to me when I know I brought you pain. So you know who I am. Yep, I knew it the first time I saw you, and then you shared your Bible with me, and you talked me into counseling with the pastor. You were just so nice to me, like you cared about me and my salvation. I've never had a friend like that, someone that cared. It's right up here. Oh, okay. Look, thanks for bringing me home. I was kind of crazy back there. I just can't stop seeing my husband's face. But you should come in, we should talk. You can just make yourself comfortable. Okay. I'm gonna go get something from the back. Okay. So do you know what happened to my husband? I don't know. Did Seth have anything to do with it? He didn't seem like the type, but, I mean, then again, who does? I was so selfish then. I just, I never stopped to think about what kind of men they were or what I was becoming. I am so sorry, Brittany, that I slept with your husband, and all of the pain that I've brought you. I wanna be better. I wanna be, I wanna be forgiven for all that I have done. I'm trying to do like you said and just take it one day at a time. I am so sorry, Brittany. Me, too. Hey, Ma. Yeah, I'm fine. I just got home from church. I was thinking we could take Vince to the park. Okay, see you in a sec. You know, I wonder how many glasses of wine you shared with my husband. I'm gonna make a phone call real quick. I hope you don't mind. Police, how can I help you? Hi, yeah, I just shot and killed someone. I'm sorry? What address are you at? 8506 Fielding. It's apartment 302. Okay. Look at my boo looking all good on her birthday. Girl, this party is lit. I know, except the fact that Camille isn't here yet. If she know what best for her, she won't show up. Stop tripping. Y'all had y'all little fight, now let it go. It's my birthday. That bitch can die for all I care. But you're right, it's your birthday. Let me go get your cake, okay? Camille, I know you got my message. You better be on your way. When can we cut into this? Not yet. Go get my baby. What is going on with him anyway? Why is he limping around? Girl, he had went to give his kids some presents, and his crazy wife shot him. Ain't that some shit? Is she in jail? Nope, she lied and said he hit her, so she had got a PBO, so technically, you know, when he got to the house, she could call it self-defense. Some bitches really know how to work the system. Man, what y'all doing back here? Didn't I tell you not to life a finger? I'm doing everything for my baby tonight. Aw, thank you, baby. Now, look, get your sexy ass back out there. I'm gonna get this cake. You sure you don't need no help? Cause you barely walking. Now, look, I got this, go ahead. All right. Let me get this ice cream, too. Shit. This for Kitty, nigga. Baby, you can't carry this cake. Tony? Tony! Tony, wake up, honey! Tony! Tony! Now the district attorney, she'll be in in a minute, but I'm gonna go over a few things with you. We've been investigating and I kind of learned a few things. Such as? Well, we know that the blood that was found on your son was your husband's blood. That means he was at the scene of the crime. We think Vito know who took your baby. That's what got him killed.
