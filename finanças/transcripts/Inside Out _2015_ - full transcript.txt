♪Subtitles corrected by♪ XQ2☻♥ Do you ever look at someone and wonder, what is going on inside their head? Well, I know. Hey, well, I know Riley's head. Hm? And there she was. Hello. - Riley| - Woh, look at you! Aren't you a little bundle of joy! Aren't you a little bundle of joy! Woh! It was amazing! Just Riley and me... forever. Or for... 33 seconds. I'm Sadness. Oh, hello, I'm Joy. So...☻ Can I just, if you could... I just wanna me fix that. Thanks. And that was just the beginning. Headquarters only got more crowded from there. Very nice. OK, looks like you got this. Very good. Oh, sharp turn! No, look Out! That's Fear. He's really good at keeping Riley safe. Easy, easy... Fall back! Oh, we're good. We're good! - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Oo, good job! - And we're back! Woh. Here we go. Alright, open. - Hm, this looks new. - Think it's safe? - What is it? OK, caution! There is a dangerous smell people. Hold on. What is that? This is Disgust. She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned, physically and socially. That is not brightly colored, or shaped like a dinosaur. Hold on guys... It's broccoli! Yuck! Well. I just saved our lives... Yeah, you're welcome. Riley, if you don't eat your dinner, you're not going to get any dessert. Wait, did he just say we couldn't have dessert? That's Anger, he cares very deeply about things being fair. So, that's how you want to play it, old man? No dessert? Oh, sure, we'll eat our dinner. Right after you eat this! Arh! Aaahh! Riley, Riley. Here comes an airplane. Aaahh... Oh, airplane! We got an airplane, everybody. - Ooh! - Ooh! And you've met Sadness. She... Well, she... Waah! Waah! Waah-haah! I'm not actually sure what she does. And I've checked, there's no place for her to go, so... She's good. We're good. It's all great. Anyway, these are Riley's memories. And they're mostly happy, you'll notice. Not to brag. But the really important ones are over here. I don't want to get too technical but these are called core memories. Each one came from a super important time in Riley's life. Like when she first scored a goal. It was so amazing! Hey, would you look at that! Very nice! - Woo-hoo! - Yayy! And each core memory powers a different aspect of Riley's personality. Like, Hockey Island. Goofball Island is my personal favorite. Come back here, you little monkey! Yup, Goofball is the best! Friendship Island is pretty good too. Oh, I love Honesty Island. And that's the truth. And of course, Family Island is amazing. - I have your present. - Oh... The point is, the islands of personality are what make Riley, Riley. Look out, Blue fish! Lava! Hoo! ♪ Who's your friend that likes to play? Bing Bong. Bing Bong. Hey, very nice! - Agh. - Brain freeze! - Agh! - Aah! Aahh! - Yeah! - Yayy! - Good night, kiddo. - Good night, Dad. And... We're out. That's what I'm talking about. Woo! Another perfect day. Nice job everybody. Let's get those memories down to long term. Alright! We did not die today! I call that an unqualified success. And, that's it. We love our girl! And she's got great friends and a great house. Things couldn't be better. After all, Riley's 11 now. What could happen? - What? - Aahh! - Huh! - Aahh! OK, not what I had in mind. Aahh! Hey, look, the Golden Gate Bridge! Isn't that great? It's not made up of solid gold like we thought, which is kind of disappointing, but still... I sure am glad you told me earthquakes are a myth, Joy. Otherwise I'd be terrified right now. Ah... yeah. These are my kind of people. Alright, just a few more blocks. - We're almost to our new house. - Step on it, Daddy. Why don't we just live in the smelly car? We're already been in it forever! Which... actually was really lucky, because that gave us plenty of time to think about what our new house is going to look like. What? Let's review the top 5 daydreams. - Woo, that looks safe! - That looks nice. Ooh, this'll be great for Riley. Oh, no, no... this one! Joy for the last time, she cannot live in a cookie. That's the one, it comes with a dragon. We're getting close, I can feel it. Here it is. Here's our new house. And... Maybe, it's nice on the inside. - We're suppose to live here? - Do we have to? I'm telling you, it smells like something died in here. - Can you die from moving? - Guys, you're overreacting. - Nobody is dying. - A dead mouse! - Great! - I'm gonna be sick. - It's a house of the dead, what're we gonna do? We're gonna get rabies! - Get offa me! - Waahh! Hey, hey, all through the drive, Dad talked about how cool our new room is. - Let's go check it out. - It's gonna be great! Yes, yes, yes! - No, no, no... - I'm starting to envy the dead mouse. Get out the rubber ball. We're in solitary confinement. - Riley can't live here. - She's right, it's really bad. - It's absolutely the worst. - This house stinks. It's the worst place I've been in my entire life. - Oh, yeah. Hey, it's nothing our butterfly curtains couldn't fix. I read somewhere that an empty room is an opportunity. - Where 'd you read that? - It doesn't matter. I read it and it's great. We'll put the bed there. And the desk over there. The hockey lamp goes there. - Put the chair there. - Oh, the trophy collections. Stars! - I like that. - Now, we're talking! Let's go get our stuff from the moving van. Alright. Goodbye. Well, guess what? The moving van won't be here until Thursday. You're kidding. - Our van is lost? - It's the worst day ever. - You said it would be here yesterday. - I know that's what I said. - That's what they told me. - Mom and Dad are stressed out. They're stressed out. What're we gonna do? - What is their problem? - I've got a great idea! Did you even read the contract? Anderson makes her move. She's closing in. Hey! Oh no, you're not. - She's lining up her shot. - Coming behind you, watch out. And she scores! Yeah! - Woo-hoo! - Yo-ho! Come on, Grandmother! Grandma?! Oh-oh, she put her hair up. We're in for it. Heyyy, put me down! Ah... Sorry, hold on. - Hello. - Wait, wha...? You're kidding me! Alright, stall for me, I'll be right there. The investor's supposed to show up on Thursday, not today. - I gotta go. - It's OK, we get it. You're the best, thanks, hon. See you, sweetie. Dad just left us. Oh, he doesn't love us anymore. That's sad. I should drive, right? Joy, what are you doing? Ah, just give me one second. You know what I've realised? Riley hasn't had lunch. Remember? Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street, maybe we can try that. -Pizza sounds delicious. - Pizza? Yeah, let's go for pizza. Great, let's get it. - What the heck is that? - Who puts broccoli on pizza? That's it, I'm done. Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined pizza! First the Hawaiians and now you! What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza? Must be a San Francisco thing. Still, it's not as bad as the soup at that diner in Nebraska. Oh, yeah. The spoon stood up in the soup by itself. We're good. Family's running. The drive out was pretty fun, huh? What was your favorite part? Spitting out of the car window. - Definitely not when Dad was singing. - Wearing the seat belt. Oh, what about the time with the dinosaur? - Oh, that's the one! - For sure. - Say cheese. - Dad. - Honey. Dad, Dad, Dad, look at the car. Just look behind you. No-no-no... Ohh! Nice one, Joy. I like that time with the dinosaur. That was pretty funny. Wait, what. What happened? She did something to the memory. - What did you do? - I, I just touched it. - That shouldn't make it change. - Oh, change it back, Joy. - I'm trying. - You can't change it back? - No, I guess I can't. - Good going, Sadness! Now when Riley thinks of that moment with Dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo! I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know... I thought maybe if you, if you, I mean... Joy, we got a stairway coming up. Just don't touch any other memories until we figured out what's going on. - OK. - Alright. Get ready. This is a monster railing and we are riding it all the way down. Wait, what... What happened? - A core memory! - Oh no! - Sadness, what're you doing? - It looked like one was crooked, so I opened it and then it fell out! Woo-hoo! It's just that, I wanted to, maybe, hold one. - Woah! Joy! - Woah, Woah, Woah! Sadness, you nearly touched a core memory! And when you touch them, we can't change them back. I know. I'm sorry. Something's wrong with me. It's like I'm having a break down. You're not having a break down. It's stress. I keep making mistakes like that. I'm awful. - No, you're not! - And annoying. The... well... You know what? You can't focus on what's going wrong. There's always a way to turn things around To find the fun. Yeah, find the fun. I don't know how to do that. OK, well... Try to think of something funny. Oh. Remember the funny movie where the dog dies? Oh, yeah... That's not... What about that time, with Meg? When Riley laughed so hard, milk came out of her nose. Come on! Yeah, that hurt, it felt like fire. It was... OK, OK. Don't think of that. Let's try something else. - What are your favorite things to do? - My favorite? Well, I like it when we're outside. That's good! Like, there's the beach and sunshine. Oh, like the time we buried Dad in the sand up to his neck. I was thinking more like rain. Rain Rain is my favorite too! We can stomp around the puddles You know, there's cool umbrellas, lightning storms. More like when the rain runs down our back, and makes our shoes soggy. And we get all cold, shivery and everything starts feeling droopy. Oh, hey, hey! Easy. Why are you crying? Th-this is really the opposite of what we're going for, here. Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems. You know what? Let's think about something else. How about we read some mind manuals. Huh? Sounds fun! I've read most of them. Have you read this one. This seem interesting. Long term memory retrieval. Volume 47. - No. - Ooh, a real page turner! Long term memory data selection via channel subgroup B. See? Fun already! Oh, you lucky dog. You're reading these cool things; I gotta go work. Life is so unfair. Ugh! What can we do? We only got capital to last a month maybe two. If we can't find investors by then, we're gonna have to lay people off. Mom, Dad, come kiss me good night! -I know. We got to land this, OK - Be right there! Did you hear Dad? He sounded really upset. What was that? Was it a bear? It's a bear! There are no bears in San Francisco. I saw a really hairy guy. He looked like a bear. Oh. I'm so jumpy, my nerves are shot! Ew, I don't wanna hear about your nerves! I'll tell you what it is. This move has been a bust. That's what I've been telling you guys. There're at least 37 things for Riley to be scared of right now. This smell alone is enough to make her gag. I can't believe Mom and Dad moved us here. Look, I get it. You guys have concerns. But we've been through worse. Tell you what. Let's make a list of all the things Riley should be happy about. Fine. Let's see, this house stinks, our room stinks. - Pizza is weird here. - Our friends are back home. And all our stuff is in the missing van. Oh, come on, it could be worse. Yeah, Joy. We could be lying on the dirty floor, in a bag. OK, I admit it. We had a rough start. - But think of all the good things... - No, Joy. There is absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now. Let us handle this. I say we skip school tomorrow and lock ourselves in the bedroom. We have no clean clothes no one should see us. And we could cry until we can't breathe. We should lock the doors and scream the curse word we know. - It's a good one. - Now, hold on! Look, we all have our off days, you know... Hi honey. The Mom-bad-news train is pulling in. Toot-toot! Still no moving van, huh! Now they're saying it won't be here till Tuesday. Can you believe it? Toot-toot-toot! - Where's Dad? - On the phone. This new venture is keeping him pretty busy. I rest my case! Your dad's a little stressed about getting his new company up and running... Now, for a few well placed withering scowls. I guess all I really want to say is... - Thank you. - Huh? You know, through all this confusion, you've stayed... Well, you've stayed our happy girl. Your Dad's under a lot of pressure. But, if you and I can keep smiling, it would be a big help. We can do that for him, right? Woh! Well. Yeah. Sure. What did we do to deserve you! - Sweet dreams. - Good night. Well, you can't argue with Mom. - Happy it is! - Can't argue, that's true. - Team Happy. Sounds great. - Totally behind you, Joy. Looks like we're going into R.E.M. I got dream duty so I'll take care of sending these to long term. Great day today, guys. All is well, team Happy. Alright, what's on tonight, dream production? Well, this is it. The new place. Come live with me, Riley... Eurk! - Somebody ordered a broccoli pizza. - Eat me, I'm organic. Oh no! Who is in charge of programming down there? I know I'm not supposed to do this, but... We are not going to end the day like this. Don't you worry. I'm going to make sure that tomorrow is another great day. I promise. - Hello, did I wake you? - Do you have to play that? Well, I have to practice. And I don't think of it as playing so much as hugging. OK, first day of school. Very, very exciting. I was up late last night figuring out a new plan. - Here it is: Fear! - Huh? I need a list of all the possible negative outcomes on the first day at a new school. Way ahead of you there. Does anyone know how to spell meteor? Disgust, make sure Riley stands out today. But, also blends in. When I'm through, Riley will look so good, the other kids will look at their own outfits and fart. Joy! Yes, Joy. You'll be in charge of the console. Keeping Riley happy all day long. And may I add, I love your dress, it's adorable. Oh, this old thing. Thank you so much. I love the way it twirls. Train of Thought, right on schedule. Anger, unload the daydreams. I ordered extra, in case things get slow in class. Might come in handy. If this new school is full of boring, useless classes. Which it probably will be. Oh, Sadness. I have a super important job just for you. - Really. - M-hm, follow me. - What are you doing? - And there. Perfect. This is the circle of sadness. Your job is to make sure that all the sadness stays inside of it. So, you want me just to stand here? Hey, it's not my place to tell you how to do your job. Just make sure that all... the sadness stays in the circle. See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun? - No. - Atta girl. Alright everyone, fresh start. We're going to have a good day which will turn into a good week, which will turn into a good year, which turns into a good life! So, big day. New school. New friends. I know. I'm kind of nervous but I'm mostly excited. - How do I look? Do you like my tote? - Very cute! You gonna be OK. You want us to walk with you? Mom and Dad, with us in public?! No, thank you. Yup, I'm on it. Nope, I'm fine. Bye Mom. Bye Dad. Have a good day in school, monkey. - Oo-oo... - Woo-oo!... - Oo... woo... Have a great day, sweetheart. - Are you sure we want to do this? - In we go! OK, going in. Yes! OK. We've got a group of cool girls at 2 o'clock. - How do you know? - Double ears pierced, infinity scarf. - Woh! Is she wearing eye shadow? - Yeah, we want to be friends with them. - Let's go talk to them. - Are you kidding?! We're not talking to them! We want them to like us. Oh, yeah! Wait... What? Almost finished with the potential disasters. Worst scenario is either quicksand, spontaneous combustion, or getting called on by the teacher. As long as none of this happens... OK, everybody, we have a new student in class today. Are you kidding me?! Out of the gate! This is not happening! Riley, would you like to tell us something about yourself? Noooo! Pretend we can't speak English. Don't worry, I got this. OK. My name is Riley Anderson. I'm from Minnesota and now I live here. And how about Minnesota? Can you tell us something about it? Well you certainly get a lot more snow than we do. Ha-ha-ha! She's hilarious. Yeah, it get's pretty cold. The lake freezes over and that’s when we play hockey. I'm on a great team. We're called the Prairie Dogs. My friend, Meg, plays forward and my dad's the coach. Pretty much everyone in my family skates. It's kind of a family tradition. We go out on the lake almost every weekend. Or, we did, till... I moved away. - Hey. What gives? - What? Hey, Sadness. You touched a memory? - We talked about this! - Hm yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Get back in your circle. Ah! What's going on? - Get it out of there, Joy! - Eject. We used to play tag and stuff. Cool kids whispering at 3 o'clock. Did you see that look? They're judging us! Somebody help grab that thing. Everybody put in... But, everything's different now. Since we moved. Oh no, we're crying at school! What?! Sadness, what are you doing? Oh, I'm sorry, oh! - It's a core memory. - But, it's blue. No, wait! Stop it! No! No! Joy, no. - That's a core memory. - Hey! - Stop it! Let go. - Don't. Wait. The core memories! Ah! No-no-no! - Aah! - Aah! Thank you, Riley. I know it can be tough moving to a new place. But we're happy to have you here. Alright everyone, get out you history books, and turn to chapter 7. Can I say that curse word now? - Aah! - Aah! Aaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaaah! Oh no! 1, 2, 3, OK. I got'em. Wha...? Where are we? Long term memory?! What... Goofball Island? Riley's Islands of personality. They'e all down! Ohh, this is bad! We... we can fix this. We just have to get back to headquarters, plug the core memories in, and Riley will be back to normal. Oh, Riley has no core memories, no personality Islands and no... - What? What is it? - You. You're not in headquarters. Without you Riley can't be happy. We gotta get you back up there. I'm coming, Riley. So, as it turns out, the green trash can is not recycling. It's for greens, like compost and eggshells. And the blue one is recycling, and the black... Riley's acting so weird! Why is she acting so weird? What do you expect? All the Islands are down! Joy would know what to do. That's it! Until she gets back, we just do what Joy would do. Good idea! Anger, Fear, Disgust... How are we supposed to be happy? Hey, Riley, I got good news. I found a Junior Hockey League, right here in San Francisco. And get this! Tryouts are tomorrow after school. What luck, right? - Hockey? - Oh-oh what do we do? Guys, th-this... You pretend to be Joy. Wouldn't it be great to be back out on the ice? Oh, yeah, that sounds fantastic. What was that? That wasn't anything like Joy! - Ah, because I'm NOT Joy! - Yeah, no kidding! Did you guus pick up on that? - Yeah, something's wrong. - Should we ask her? Let's probe. But keep it subtle so she doesn't notice. So, how was the first day of school? She's probing us. I'm done. You pretend to be Joy. What? OK... It was fine, I guess, I dunno. Oh, very smooth. That was just like Joy! Something is definitely going on! She's never acted like this, before. What should we do? We're gonna find out what's happening. But we'll need support. Signal the husband. Ahem! With a nice pass, over to Reed, coming across center-ice. Ahem! Uh-oh! She's looking at us. - What did she say? - What? Oh, sorry sir, no one was listening. Is it garbage night? We left the toilet seat up? What? What is it, woman? What? - He's making that stupid face again. - I could strangle him right now! Signal him again. Ah! So... Riley, how was school? - Aw, Seriously? - You gotta be kidding me! For this, we gave up that Brazilian helicopter pilot?! Move! I'll be joy. School was great, alright! Riley? Is everything OK? Argh... Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us. What is her deal? Alright, make a show of force. I don't wanna have to put the foot down. No, not the foot! Riley, I do not like this new attitude. Oh, I'll show you attitude, old man! No, no-no, stay happy. What is your problem? Just leave me alone! Sir, reporting high level of sass. Take it to DefCon 2. Your heard that gentlemen. DefCon 2! Listen, young lady, I don't know where this disrespectful attitude came from. You wanna piece of this, pops? Come and get it! Yeah? Well, well... Here it comes. Prepare the foot! Keys, to Safety Position! Ready to launch on your command, sir. Aaargh! Just, shut up! Fire! That's it. Go to your room! Now! Hah! Gah! Foot is down. The foot is down! Good job, gentlemen. That could've been a disaster. Well, that was a disaster. Come, fly with me, gatinha. (kitten) - Ah! - Ahh! We're gonna walk out there, on that? It's the quickest way back. But it's right over the Memory Dump. If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever. We have to do this for Riley. Just follow my footsteps. It's not that high. It's totally, .. Woa-ah. Hey. So... Things got a little out of hand downstairs. Do you wanna talk about it? Come on. Where's my happy girl? Monkey. Ooo-oo. Oh! He's trying to start up Goofball. Come on. Ooo-oo-a-a-aa! Aah! Go back! Turn around! What the...? I get it. You need some alone time. We'll talk later. - We have a major problem. - Oh, Joy, where are you? We lost Goofball Island. That means she can lose Friendship, and Hockey and Honesty and Family. You can fix this, right, Joy? - I-I don't know. - Ohhh! But we have to try. OK, come on. - Riley's gone to sleep. - Ohhh! Which is a good thing... When you think about it, because nothing else bad can happen while she's asleep. We'll be back to Headquarters before she wakes up. We'll just go across Friendship Island. - Oh, we'll never make it! - No-no-no... Don't obsess over the weight of life's problems. Remember the funny movie where the dog dies. Oh Sadness, we don't have time for this. We'll just have to go around. Take the scenic route. Wait, Joy, you can get lost in there. - Think positive. - OK. I'm positive you will get lost in there. That's long term memory. An endless warren of corridors and shelves. I read about it in the manuals. The manuals? The manuals! - You read the manuals. - Yeah. So you know the way back to headquarters. - I guess. - Woo-Hnn-nn! You are my map. Let's go! Lead on, my map. Show me where we're going. OK, only... I'm too sad to walk. Just give me a few... hours. - Which way, left? - Right. No, I mean go left. I said left was right, like, correct. OK. This actually feels kinda nice. OK, here we go. We'll be back to Headquarters before morning. We can do it. This'll be easy! This is working! This is not working. - Are we getting close? - Yeah, just another right. And a left and then another left. Are you sure you know where we're going? 'Cause we seem to be walking away from Headquarters. Oh, Riley's awake. Oh! Oh, uh! Don't. Don't touch, remember? If you touch them, they stay sad. Oh, sorry, I- I won't. - Starting now. - I can't take much more of this. Forget'em! - Mind workers. - But, Joy, we're almost oh. Phone numbers. We don't need all these. They're in her phone. - Just forget all that. - Excuse me. Hi! Forget it! I need to find Friendship Island. 4 years of piano lessons! - Yeah, looks pretty faded. - You know what? Save Chopsticks and Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest. - Are you?... - US presidents, what do you think? Just keep Washington, Lincoln and the fat one. - Forget'em! - Hey! You can't throw those away. Those are perfectly good memories. The names of every Cutiepie princess doll? Yes, that is critical information. - Glitter storm, Honey pants... - Forget'em! - Hey, bring those back! - They're in the Dump. - Nothing comes back from the Dump. - Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, OK? When Riley doesn't care about a memory, it fades. - Fades? - Happens to the best of'em. Except for this bad boy. This one will never fade. ♪ Tripledent gum will make you... The song from the gum commercial? You know, sometimes we send that one up to Headquarters for no reason. Just plays in Rileys head over and over again like a million times. Let's watch it again. Yeah, I know. We all know the song. OK, real catchy. - Hey, what do you think, should we do it? - Yeah. OK. Here we go! Ha-ha-ha. ♪ Tripledent gum... What the?... This again? Oh, Great! Wait, do you know how to get to Friendship Island? Do you like it there? Did you feel any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool? Yeah, it's good. What happened with the playoffs? We won the first game. Coach says we might actually go to the finals this year. Oh, and we got this new girl on the team. She's so cool! - Ah, she did not just say that! - A new girl? Meg has a new friend already? - Grr! - Hey-hey! Stay happy. We do not wanna lose any more islands here, guys. We can pass the puck to each other without even looking. It's like mind reading. You like to read minds, Meg? I got something for you to read right here! W-wait, let's just be calm for 1 sec... Aaargh! - I gotta go. - What? I gotta go! Wait, could you just please tell me which way is... Oh no! Friendship Island! What? Not Friendship! Oh, Riley loved that one. And now it's gone. Goodbye, Friendship. Hello, Loneliness. Grrr! We'll just have to go the long way. Yeah, the long long long, way. I'm ready. There's gotta be a better way. - Oo,well look at you! - Huh? I will take you, but not you. Oh, who am I kidding? I can't leave you! Hello! - Aah! - Wait. Hey, wait! No, wait. Stop. - Excuse me. - Aah! Oh, I was, I was looking for.... - diversion! - What? Ha ha, so long, sucker! Ow, I hurt all over! Wait, I know you. No, you don't. I get that a lot. - I look like a lot of people. - No no! I do. Bing Bong! Riley's imaginary friend. - You really do know me? - Of course! Riley loved playing with you. You two were best friends. Oh, you would know! - We're trying to get back to Headquarters. - Headquarters? - You guys are from Headquarters? - Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness. - You're Joy, the Joy? - M-hm! What the heck are you doing out here? That's a good question. Wanna answer that, Sadness? Without you, I won't ever be happy. We can't have that, we gotta get you back! I'll tell you what, follow me. Thank you. It is so great to see you again. I gotta tell you, I am such a huge fan of your work. Do you remember when you and Riley were in a band? Ha-ha! I went to all of your concerts. Yeah, I blow a mean nose. - Watching you play tag was such a treat. - 2 time world champ! Oh, and remember your rocket? Of course, it runs on song power! That's right, your theme song. ♪ - Who's your friend who likes to play? - Bing Bong, Bing Bong. ♪ - His rocket makes you yell Hooray! - Bing Bong, Bing Bong. What exactly are you supposed to be? You know it's unclear. I'm mostly cotton candy, but, shape-wise, I'm part cat, part elephant, part dolphin. Dolphin? [Ki-ki-ki-ki...!] You gotta remember, when Riley was 3, animals were all the rage. The cow goes, moo, the horse goes, neigh. It's all people talked about back then. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's true. What are you doing out here? Well, there's not much call for imaginary friends, lately. So, I, you know... Hey, hey, don't be sad. Tell you what, when I get back up to Headquarters, I'll make sure Riley remembers you. - You will? - Of course! She'd love that. Ha-haa! This is the greatest day of my life! Hot-cha-cha... Ow ow ow... - Are you OK? - Hey, what's going on? I cry candy. - Try the caramel, it's delicious. - Oo! Woah! - Oo! Here use this. - Thanks. Oh, hold on. Wait a second. It always get stuck at the bottom. Here. Wha...? It's imaginary! Thanks! This will make it a lot easier to walk back to Headquarters. Walk?! We're not walking. We're taking the Train of Thought. The Train, of course! That is so much faster. But how do we catch it? Well, it kinda goes all over the place but there is a station in Imagination Land. I know a shortcut. Come on, this way. Oh, I'm so glad we ran into you. The station is right in here. After you. - Joy. - What? I read about this place in the manual We shouldn't go in there. Bing Bong says it's the quickest way to Headquarters. No, but Joy, this is abstract thought. What are you talking about? I go in here all the time. It's a shortcut, you see? D-A-N-G-E-R: Shortcut! I'll prove it to you. Look at me. I'm closer to the station. 'Cause I'm taking the shortcut. Let's go around. This way. Almost there, now! If you wanna walk the long way, go for it. But Riley needs to be happy. I'm not missing that Train. Bing Bong knows what he is doing. He's part dolphin, they're very smart. Well, I guess. OK, what abstract concept are we trying to comprehend today? Ahm, loneliness. Hm, looks like there's something in there. I'm gonna turn it on for a minute and burn out the gunk. What did I tell ya? You'll be in Headquarters in no time! Hey, will you look at that? - Woah! What's happening? - Oh no, they turned it on! Huh? Never seen this before. Whaaat?! Aahh! My face! My beautiful face! No! - What is going on? - We're abstracting. There are 4 stages. This is the first. Non-objective fragmentation. Alright, do not panic! What is important is that we all stay together. - Oh! - Ah! We're in the second stage, we’re deconstructing! Run! Ah, I can't feel my legs! Oh, there they are. Come here, me! We gotta get outta here, before we're not even shape and color! We'll get stuck here forever! Bong, why did we come in here? I told you, it's a shortcut. The Train! Oh no, we're 2 dimensional! That's stage 3. We're getting nowhere. - Depth! I'm lacking depth. - Come on! We can't fit. Oh no, we're not figurative! This is the last stage. We're not gonna make it. Ohh! Wait, we're 2 dimensional. Fall on your face. Stop. Stop! Oh, no! You said that was a shortcut. I did. But wow, we should not have gone in there! That was dangerous. They, really, should put up a sign. - How long till the next Train? - Who knows? But don’t worry. There's another station. That way. The Train always stops there, right before it goes to Headquarters. If we hurry, we can catch it. This isn't another one of your shortcuts, is it? Ha-ha-ha! Yeah! Is there really another station? Uh-huh. Through there. Welcome to Imagination Land! Imagination Land? Sure, I come here all the time. I'm practically the mayor. Hey, you guys hungry? There's French Fry Forest. No way?! Ha-ha-ha! Check it out. Trophy Town. Medals, ribbons... everyone's a winner. I won first place! Me too! Oh, participation award! Wait, is that?... Is that a?... Look. It's Cloud Town. That's my favorite, hoo-hoo-hoo! - Oh, it's so soft. - O-ho, let me try. Hey, what's the big idea? You'd better fix that wall or else you're in big trouble. - Oh no, lava! - Woo. Woah! Imagination Land is the best. Oh, is it all gonna be so interactive? Hey look, the House of Cards! Oh, wait! Hang on just a minute. Ah, your rocket! Yeah, I stashed it in there for safekeeping. And now I'm all set to take Riley to the moon! - Oh, I'm sorry. - Great! -Oh, I love Imagination Land! - Isn't it great? And there's always something new like... - Who the heck is that? - Imaginary boyfriend. - I would die for Riley. - Oh, blekh! - I've never seen him before. - I live in Canada. Anyway. This way, through Preschool World. We're nearly to the train. Riley, here we come. Woo-hoo! Ha-ha-ha! This should be fun. New team, new friends... There kids look pretty good. Considering they're from San Francisco. Heheh! - Gotta go. - OK. Good luck, sweetie! Luck isn't going to help us now. If she tries to use Hockey Island, it's going down. Which is why, I've recalled every hockey memory I can think of. One of these has gotta work in place of the core memory. - She's about to play. - Hurry. Ha ha! We did it gang. It's working! Oh! Line change! Change it up! Haha! No-no. Aahh! It's like we don't learn anything. - That's it! - No no, breathe... find your happy place. Aaarggh! - Riley, what's wrong? - Let's go. - You're not going to finish tryouts? - What's the point? Hey, it'll be alright. Let's just... Stop saying everything will be alright! Nice hustling, ladies! Hockey?! Oh no no, she loves hockey, she can't give up hockey! Bing Bong, we have to get to that station. Sure thing. This way, just past Graham Cracker Castle. Hey, that's weird! Graham Cracker Castle used to be right here, I wonder why they moved it. I would've sworn, Sparkle Pony Mountain was right here. - Hey, what's going on? - Y-yeah, I dunno, - we'll have to come back. - Princess Dreamworld! Oh, the Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame! My rocket? Wait, Riley and I we're still using that rocket. It still has some song power left. ♪ Who's your friend who likes to play? - ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ No! No no. You can't take my rocket to the Dump. Riley and I are going to the moon! Riley can't be done with me? Hey, it's gonna be OK! We can fix this! We just need to get back to Headquarters. Which way to the Train station? I had a whole trip planned for us. Hey, who's ticklish? Here comes the tickle monster! Hey, Bing Bong, look at this. Blgoyoyngg! Oh, here's a fun game. You point to the Train station and we all go there. Won't that be fun? Come on, let's go to the Train station! I'm sorry they took your rocket. They took something that you loved. It's gone, forever. - Sadness, don't make him feel worse. - Sorry. It's all I had left of Riley. I bet you and Riley had great adventures. Oh, they were wonderful. Once, we flew back in time. We had breakfast twice that day. Sadness. It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it. Oh, she did. We were best friends. Yeah. It's sad. Wha...? I'm OK now. Come on. The Train station is this way. - How did you do that? - Oh, I don't know. I feel he's sad, so, I listen to what... Hey! ... There's the Train. Oh, we made it, we're finally gonna get home! Oh no, these facts and opinions look so similar. Ah, don't worry about it. Happens all the time. On a scale of 1 to 10. I give this day an 'F'. Well, why don't we quit standing around and do something. Like what, genius? Like quitting. That's what I'm doing. Sure, it's the coward's way out. But this coward's gonna survive! Emotions can't quit, genius. Ugh! I thought we're supposed to be keeping Riley happy. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Aha! Ho ho ho... - What is it? - Oh nothing. - Just the best idea ever. - What? All the good core memories were made in Minnesota. Ergo, we go back to Minnesota and make more. Ta-dah! Wait wait wait. You're saying, we run away? Well, I wouldn't call it that. I'd call it the Happy Core Memory Development Program. - You can't be serious. - Hey, our life was perfect. Until Mon and Dad decided to move to San Fran-stinko. But, I mean, it's just so drastic. Need I remind you of how great things were there? Our room. Our backyard. Our friends. ♪ Tripledent gum will make you smile Did I ask for the gum commercial? Anyway, it was better. That's my point. - Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota. - Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we just sleep on this or something? Fine, let's sleep on it. Because, hey, I'm sure jolly fun-filled times are just around the corner. Huh? Hey hey, why aren't we moving? Riley's gone to sleep. We're all on break. You mean we're stuck here until morning? Yeah, the Train of Thought doesn't run while she's asleep. - Oh, we can't wait that long. - How about we wake her up. Sadness, that's ridiculous. How can we possibly... - How about we wake her up. - Great idea Joy. Thanks, come on! Woh, this place is huge! It looks so much smaller than I expected. Wow, 'I Can Fly'! I love that one! Rainbow Unicorn. She's right there. My friend says you're famous. - She wants your autograph. - No no, Sadness. Don't bother Miss Unicorn, OK? Sorry she's from out of town. It's so embarrassing, right? I loved you in Fairy Dream Adventure part 7. OK bye. I love you. Hah! Wonder what that means? Oh well, let's go in. Set up the classroom set. Today's memories are in. We've got a lot to work with here. Riley dumped her best friend, had a miserable day at school and quit hockey. The writers have put together a killer script. Just because Joy and Sadness are gone, I have to do stupid dream duty. OK, how are we gonna wake her up? Well, she wakes up sometimes when she has a scary dream. - We could scare her. - Scare her? - No no. She's been through enough already. - But, Joy. Sadness, you may know your way around down here. But I know Riley. We're gonna make her so happy, she'll wake up with exhilaration We'll excite her awake. That's never happen before. Oo, Riley loves dogs. Put this on. I don't think that'll work. - Bing Bong. - Yeah. Don't let anything happen to these. Got it. M-hm! Add the reality distortion filter. Love it. Remember, play to the camera everyone. Riley is the camera. Make-up get outta there. We are on in 5 4 3... Hello class! Before we begin today’s pop quiz... Man, she is one bad actress! ...final grade, I want to introduce our new student. Riley, would you like to stand up and introduce yourself? Camera. And, cue Riley. My name is Riley Anderson. I'm from Minnesota and now I live here. Ew! Look, her teeth are falling out. That's gross! Teeth falling out. Pfft! Yeah, I'm used to that one. Lemme guess, we have no pants on. Hey, look, she came to school with no pants on! Called it! - Ready? - I don't think this happy thing is going to work. - But if we scare her. - Just follow my lead. Here we go. - Aahh, oo! - Bark-bark-bark! - Who is that? - Uhm.. what's going on? Psst, you're on, go! Wooh, let's party! Let's dance. Wooh! Hey, a party! Bark-bark-bark! Joy, this isn't working. No. Huh? ... Sadness, what are you doing? Come back here. It's just a dream. It's just a dream. It's just a dream. They're trying to wake her up! Call security! - Hi Riley, it's me! - Bing Bong?! ♪ ...friend who likes to play? Bing Bong, Bing Bong Sadness, you are ruining this dream. - You're scaring her. - But look, it's working. Woh! They're not part of this dream. Get them. Stop right there! Pan away. Pan away! Boo! Pick a plot line! Ow, careful! You can't do this! I know people in Headquarters. No-no-no... There go the core memories! Come on. - What is this place? - The subconscious. It's where they take all the troublemakers. My hat feels loose. How do we get in? Have you got my hat, or is that your hat? Yeah, it's my hat. You sure? I dunno, look on the label. Yeah, it says my hat. - Wait, it says "my hat"? - "My hat", it says. - That's what I wrote in my hat. - What are you talking about? - Ah, you got my hat on. - OK, it's my hat. - Hey you! - Oh, you caught us. Get back in there! No escaping. Oh! I don't like it here. It's where they keep Riley's darkest fears. It's broccoli. The stairs to the basement. Grandma's vacuum cleaner, aah! OK, come on. - Would you walk quieter. - I'm trying. What is going... Candy wrappers? - Bing Bong! - Joy? - There you are! - Shh! Uhh! It's Jangles! Who's the birthday girl? Birthday girl? - Do you have the core memories? - Yeah. All he cared about was the candy. Shh! We're outta here. Let's get to that Train. Wait, the Train's not running. We still have to wake up Riley. But how? Oh no! Hey Sadness, did you hear about the p-party they were having? Yeah, yeah Joy. Isn't it a b-b-birthday party? Did you say birthday? - And there's going to be cake and presents. - And games and balloons. A Birthday? OK, follow us. Nothing like a good scare to wake you up, right? OK, but it's my handwriting. No, it isn't. It's my hat, I wrote that. No, but this one's my ha... Who's the birthday girl? Aah! - Woo-hoo! - Come on, let's go! - Ha ha, we made it! - Ha ha! Guess who's on their way to Headquarters? We are! - What is going on? - He did it again. We were at school and we were naked, and there was a dog... The back half was... was chasing it... - It was Bing Bong. - You idiot, it was a dream! This is ridiculous! We can't even get a good night sleep anymore. Time to take action. Stupid Mon and Dad, if they hadn't moved us none of this would have happened. Who's with me? Yeah, let's do it. She took it. There's no turning back. So, how are we going to get to Minnesota from here? Well, why don't we go down to the elephant lot and rent an elephant? Hey, that sounds nice! We're taking the bus, nitwit! There's a bus leaving tomorrow. Perfect! A ticket costs money. How do we get money? - Mom's purse. - Oh, you wouldn't! Oh, but I would. Where was it we saw it last? ♪ Tripledent gum... - NOOO!! - Aah! It's downstairs somewhere. Mom and Dad got us into this mess, they can pay to get us out. How about this, huh? Is this nice? You can see everything from up here. Look, there's Inductive Reasoning. There's Deja Vu. There's Language Processing. There's Deja Vu. There's Critical Thinking. There's Deja Vu. And look at this, guys. Memories! Hey, that was a good idea, about scaring Riley awake. - You're not so bad. - Really? Nice work. Ah, I can't wait to get the old Riley back. As soon as we get there, I'm gonna fix this whole mess. Wow, is this Riley? She's so big now, she won't fit in my rocket. How are we gonna get to the moon? Oh, it's that time in the Twistee Tree, remember? The hockey team showed up and Mon and Dad were there cheering. Look at her, having fun and laughing. - Ah, I love this one. - Hm, I love that one too. - Atta girl! Now you're getting it. - Yeah. It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful, she wanted to quit. Sorry, I went sad again, didn't I? I'll tell you what, we can keep working on that when we get back, OK? OK. I just don't understand. Why did our moving van even go to Texas? Multiple customers? Well, we were promised delivery on the 5th. Uh-huh. Excuse me, isn't there any way that you can rush it? Honesty Island? Look out! Aaahh! Come on! Hold on! - Hurry up. - Jump over here! - Go-go-go. - I got it. - Pull! - Pull! That was our way home. We lost another island. What is happening? Haven't you heard? Riley's running away. What? Wait wait! Hang on, guys. Are we really doing this? This is serious. Look, we have no core memories. You want Riley to be happy? Let's get back to Minnesota and make more. Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her. Family Island. Let's go! Joy! Joy, it's too dangerous, we won't make it in time. But, that's our only way back. A recall tube. We can get recall. Have a great day, sweetheart. - See you after school, monkey. - We love you. Go, run run! Go! Whoa-whoa, Sadness! Sadness, stop! - You're hurting Riley. - No no no, I did it again! If you get in here, these core memories will get sad. I'm sorry. - Riley needs to be happy. - Joy? Aaah! Joy! Aaah! Joy! Joy? Joy! Joy, Joy, what are you doing? Will you stop it, please. Don't you get it, Joy? We're stuck down here! We're forgotten. (We used to play tag, and stuff.) (But, everything's different now.) (Since we moved.) Do you remember, how she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring? I could listen to her stories all day. I just wanted Riley to be happy. It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit. Sadness. Mom and Dad, the team; they came to help because of sadness. We have to get back up there. Joy, we're stuck down here. We might as well be on another planet.
