One more. Hon, we'll be late. -You wait! -No. -Hon, wait! -Don't answer it! Give me that! Hon, it must be work. Place it on my table. I'm on my way. Hon, sit up straight. -Is this it, ma'am? -That'll do. -Is Jeff's gift in the car already? -Yes, it is. Please tell Hazel that I'm sorry, I won't be able to attend the party. -Erica! I packed food in the kitchen. -Ma'am? It's for my husband. -Put it in his car. -OK. -Thank you. -What is it? I made you a tuna sandwich. You eat too much fast food. I also packed fruits and fresh juice. You should drink less soft drinks. It's just once a week. -Vitamins. -How's the promotion? Think you'll get it? I hope so. Of course. You'll get it for sure. Do you want me to? I'd like to stay here at home. I could be your sexy wife by day and your dirty mistress by night. Mistress only by night? Why can't it be the whole day? MALACANANG OF THE NORTH -Botchok, Uncle Tristan is here. -Botchok! Botchok, take your vitamins. -Pass the ball! -Come on… Uncle! He hasn't taken his vitamins yet. -Take this first. -Take it now… There you go! -Wow! -I am strong now! Are you stronger? -Take the rest so you can be stronger! -You smell sweaty. There you go! -Come on, let's go outside. -OK. Botchok… -I have to leave now. -OK. Be a good boy. -I promise. -You promise? -Don't forget your medicine. -OK. Grace… Do what you have to do. Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? There's no need. Aren't you going to La Union tomorrow? I don't have to. I can come with you to Manila. Don't bother. I can do this. Give me a call as soon as you get there. You want me to call you when I get there? Yes. And before I sleep? Yes. When I wake up in the morning? Of course. Before I eat? Sure. Before I take a bath? I'd like that! Why are you still here? Aren't you in a hurry? Where's my wife? She went back in. I thought you already left. I'm tired of trying. The pediatrician is right, Grace. The blood bank will run out of supplies if you just rely on blood transfusions! What your child needs is a bone marrow transplant. That is the solution to severe aplastic anemia. All of you were tested, but no one was a match! You're hoping for a donor? You have a better chance of winning the lottery. What can we do? Look for Botchok's father. Jacq… Thank you for approving my emergency loan. Now my husband can have his surgery. Thank you so much. It was nothing. Keep me posted, OK? -Give him my regards. -Thank you. Don't cry. I need to do this for my husband. But are you sure that this is what you really want? Especially now that you're up for another promotion. This is also difficult for me. But I have to do this. You know why. I'm at the office. -Did you confirm our booking? -Not yet, sir. -Yes, sir. -Yeah. Please sign this. Grace? How are you? You? How are you? I'm fine. No. But I have a boyfriend. And... I have a son. He's sick. He needs the help of his father. Botchok… And… it's important for me to help him. Right? they will harvest my bone marrow and transfer it to him. It's important for me to do it here in Manila. We can help him better here. But... why did you only tell my husband now? Why didn't you ask for help before? I don't know. I was too proud. It's my fault. I should have done this sooner. Please don't think I'm here to bother you. I just need your help very badly. I don't mean to cause trouble. No. You won't cause any trouble… if you only take what you need. How did you get here? I came with my driver. What are you doing here? How was your trip? It was OK, but there was heavy traffic. The tissue typing will take five days, so I decided to come home. I hope Edward's a match so that this will all be over. I will go with you to Manila. That's a good idea. I missed you. I missed you more. How's the mestizo? Wealthy. And handsome, too. Is he? But not as handsome as you are. I know. And he's married. His wife's beautiful. More beautiful than you? No. Sexier than you? I'm sexier. They had to catch the Adarna bird so the king would get well. The king's sons went to a mountain far away, but they all fell asleep. How is the king going to get well now, Mama? The king has another son. His name is Prince Juan. He is the only hope for the king. So, tonight, pray that the king will get well, all right? The king will get well, Mama. That's why you need to pray before you sleep. Edward, Jacq, this is Tristan, my boyfriend. Where's Botchok? He's in Baguio with his grandmother. We just checked in at a hotel. Where is Dr. Diesta's clinic? But don't lose hope. If Botchok were to have a sibling, we could harvest bone marrow from them. We will take Edward's sperm cells and Grace's egg cells. What if the in vitro fails? Sex. It has a higher success rate. it also seems more complicated. No, I don't have a family. That the child needs a donor. But it's not that simple. The donor will be the sibling of the son your husband had with that woman, that barrio lady! Can I say no to them? The child could die if we refuse to help! And the child could die even if you help! I don't know what to do. And to my husband at that, who has wanted a child for so long that I've failed to give him? And this is your compromise? You trust that woman? who almost ruined your life back then. The child you are trying to save may be the same child who will destroy your family! Obstetricians are experts on the uterus, not the heart. What is Tristan to you right now? I love him. When this is all over, I will marry him. But why did you not run after Edward back then? He wasn't married back then. You could have had him. For what? I got through it, didn't I? If it weren't for my son, I wouldn't have contacted them. That's what I mean by the natural way. It's easy to pretend you are righteous. What is immoral and unethical no longer matters. What matters is the life of my godchild! Yes, I'm ready. Just make sure you don't have unfinished business with Edward. it's not just the sperms and eggs meeting, but also your heart, mind, body, soul, and everything in-between. So, this is the real deal. Everything is on the line here. Can you handle it? I can. Are you sure you can? Yes, I can. I would do anything for my son. Then it's done! Grace, you go girl. You're crazy. You'll see your son soon. I'm afraid that… We'll help him with everything. We won't refuse him that. And please remember, you're not alone in this. You have me. Here it is. Please sign it. Finally, we're here! -Get down. I'll just get your bag. -I'll be with you in a while. Son, your towel! -I don't want to eat it. -Come on… Finish this so you can take your medicine. Grace, Jacq's here. Jacq. It's huge and everything is nice. But isn't this too much? No. Edward just wants to make it up to his son. Actually, he's on his way here. Jacq, this is Botchok. I'm your Aunt Jacq. -Be careful! -Not too fast! Grace, I'll be over there. See you at home. Botchok, come here, I'll tell you something. How are you feeling? Do you feel OK? -Yes. -Botchok… Do you remember what you always ask me about? About your father? He's here. -Do you want to meet him? -Yes. Botchok… he's your papa, Edward. Go to him, Botchok. Botchok… -Mama, hurry! -Wait a second, son. Be careful! You might trip! -It's beautiful here, Papa! -Let's go! Don't go far. Mama's just here. Bro, are you OK? Whoo, it feels good. Don't tell me you pushed through with it? The boy just wants to swim. And besides, this is a good opportunity for Edward to bond with his son. You give them what they want, and the next thing you know, you've given away your husband without even realizing it! We're just having fun. OK? We both brought adobo. So it seems. It's all right. Thank you, Jacq. Botchok is very happy. I'm sorry you had to skip work today. Edward is lucky to have you. Papa, the score is one-zero. -Catch up, Papa! -Of course! I will. What is my favorite color? Papa is correct! Wow! OK! Isn't red your favorite color? Blue is my new favorite. Oh, so you changed it. Who's my favorite superhero? It's Thor, right? You know who. -Thor! -Uncle Tristan is correct! You silly boy! -Are we coming back here? -Botchok? -Yes, we are. -Put your jacket on first. -Wear your jacket. -We agreed you'd wear it. Have you and Grace been together long? Yes. Why haven't you two gotten married yet? When the child gets well, we will. Are you really this nice? I love Grace. I love Botchok as well. What about you? Why are you agreeing to this? Agreeing is different from tolerating. And tolerating is different from suffering in silence. I can suffer in silence for the one I love. That's easy to say at first. But for how long? I don't know. Because if I knew… then that wouldn't be love anymore. -How are you feeling? -Jacq, he's dizzy! Come here. Jacq, he's dizzy. -What? -Botchok? -Tristan… -Does he have a fever? His medicine is here! -Yes, Botchok? -When are we going home? Don't you like it here? I miss Grandma and my friends. Come here. You know why we're here, don't you? I do. I'm sick. When… When I'm well, we'll go home. We'll go home! Yes, we will! Of course, dear. We will. -We have to pray harder. -Yes! Let's pray to Jesus that you will get well soon. Jesus… -Please make me well… -Please… So I can go home and be with Grandma and my friends. It's your call. My opinion is… It'll take five-to-ten minutes. After you get off, it's done. I don't understand your obsession I don't know about you, but I am offended by the idea and by you! Why do I feel like we are at their beck and call? We do what they want! Tissue typing, in vitro, sure! I have been supportive of you! But why do I feel like I'm the villain here? -What options? -We have the final say. -You call those options? -What are they, then? There should be many choices! We are decent. Educated. We have money. -We can take the boy to the US! -Can we do that right now? -There's no time! -You speak as if we don't have a choice! Why do I feel like the reason you aren't opposing this is because you actually want to do it? What did you just say? Stop it. We may never run out of money, but I'm running out of patience. Hey… What time is it? Stop. Stop! Stop it. Stop! Stop it! I forgot. I shouldn't be the one to get you pregnant. You should be resting! I will finish what I started. Marga, you know that my baby is important to me, and I'm doing this for him. I don't want him to go through what I experienced. I don't want him to have a difficult life. I don't want him to… I don't want him to have to beg and just swallow what's handed to him. What kind of mother am I if I give up this easily? I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know who can help me. I could never forgive myself if anything bad happened to my son. Grace… Don't lose hope. God will not abandon us. Let us just do what is right. I'm close to losing sight of what's right. What do I need to do? I almost want to sell myself just to save my son. You're right, Grace. Every mother would do anything for their child. But, dear… Don't you forget that some women would kill to protect their husbands. And remember, no trespassing. Learn to knock before you enter. Don't just barge in. Ma'am, Ms. Grace is here. Looks like they'll be late. Have some snacks. I'll just finish this up. This'll be quick. Jacq… we're running out of time. I need Edward. Botchok needs him. Even just for a moment… Even just for a night… lend me your husband. No. I won't. I will get down on my knees. I will do anything you want. Don't bother. I don't have to explain myself. I'm not denying your son his right to a father. But as a wife, I have every right to deny you my husband. I know what happened with Grace in the past was a mistake, but… two wrongs don't make a right. Bro, I'm just worried… She's stuck it out with you since college. But… But my conscience can't take it. I don't know. Or maybe… Maybe I do know, but I don't want to admit it. I will not let my son die. Let's play here. -May I see the big, brown one? -This one? Boom! Hey! Nanny! Nanny, a child fell down! -Hey, your kid! -Nanny! -Nanny! -That's Botchok! -Hey, kid! Wake up! -Sir! Sir, it's Botchok! He's inside! -Where is he? -He's unconscious! -Botchok! -Botchok! Wake up! Botchok! Botchok! -What happened here? -He just collapsed. Move! -Oh dear! Botchok! -Botchok! What happened to the boy? He collapsed. -I don't know why. -We'll take a look. Where's Botchok? I'm the mother. How is he? He's still unconscious. Excuse us. He has severe aplastic anemia. All right. -What happened? -He fell unconscious. Please adjust the oxygen mask and the IV. Botchok? What do you mean, you approve but on your terms? Jacq, don't make this harder than it already is. Come on! Where are they? They left a while ago. They asked me to hand you these keys. Let's take the batteries. Boom! So, it's negative. Singapore isn't far. We can bring the boy there. We can actually stay there while Botchok is being treated. Wait… Botchok and I don't have visas yet. No. Botchok is not up for adoption. We're running out of options. I am saving my child, not giving him away. Where are you going? Are you going with Jacq to Singapore? Prince Juan took his knife, cut himself, then poured lime juice over it to keep himself awake. That's painful, Mom. I couldn't do that. Sure you could. The king… has to get well, doesn't he? No matter how painful it is, Prince Juan will have to bear it. Right, son? Thank you, Mom. What for? Because I'm well now. Of course, my son. You're very strong now. How many times do I have to tell you that you're just wasting money on the transfusion? He needs the operation. You know what? Why did you let the wife arrange it? You definitely can't do well in that situation. And you know what she is. Hashtag overprotective. Hashtag paranoid wife. Hashtag buzzkill. What were you--? Grace. Doc. What's our… One more try? How many more tries? If you want to make a scene, spare my friend. You were talking about having sex with my husband, and now you're ashamed? I didn't know you'd subscribed to unlimited sex with my husband and now want to make the most of it. Don't push me too far. Wait a minute. I came to you. I told you my problem. It's your husband's son who is ill here, not just anybody! Did you think I liked it? That I enjoyed that night? You treated me like a dog you gave a scrap of bone to after you'd had your share. To you, it may have seemed like I gave you a scrap of bone, but the leftovers I gave you, even if they were scraps, were mine. You almost stole my husband from me. Did you think I've forgotten that? I didn't know he had you back then! And when I did know, did I bother you? Didn't I just keep quiet? Which you should have just done now! I am a mother, Jacq! Oh, well… Why should I expect you to understand? You've never had a child to take care of. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know what I've gone through. You borrowed my husband. And I agreed. You asked for one night, and now you want to keep him? Who are you? Are you a god who can control your son's life? If he'll live, he will. If he'll die, then he'll die. Just accept it! Just try… Just try to take my husband away from me! Why did you do that, Jacq? Did it help? Edward, I know and understand. That's why I agreed to everything, right? But it's not my fault if she has a faulty reproductive system. Jacq, who-- Who are you to talk that way? It's my fault? I'm the one at fault here? It's my fault that I can't give you a son? Before you tell me that, I hope you remember that you had that child because you cheated on me! So, you wanted to get even? Is that it? Was that why you had our baby aborted? It was not an abortion. -What was it? -A miscarriage! A miscarriage? The doctors told you it was a delicate pregnancy. But what did you do? You didn't listen to me. I asked you, begged you, to quit working. But you didn't. What did you do? You chose your career. You chose your job. That freaking career of yours! I chose to work so I could give our baby a better life! What life? What is there now? We almost had it, and what is there now? Nothing! What life are you talking about? There is none! You don't know what you're saying because you didn't go through what I went through! You don't know how hard it is to be treated like trash as an orphan. When I learned I was pregnant, and we were not ready, I couldn't quit my job. Was I wrong? Was it wrong to want a better life for my child? Who would want to lose a child? And me… As your wife, did I fail you? Can you give me that? Ma'am, everything you need is here, OK? I'm leaving for Singapore. But if you want me to stay, just say it. You should go or you'll be late. Go on. Sir, Ma'am Jacq has been calling. She's been asking for you. OK. Botchok's birthday is coming up soon. Like, maybe… Anywhere is fine with me. It can be in Baguio. Or anywhere. You're OK with going back to Baguio? Of course. Of course. Everything's fine here. Actually, you should come. This weekend? It's the boy's birthday. Let me know when… you have free time. I can make arrangements. I can file for leave. OK. Bye. We're not on good terms yet. Everything's a mess, bro. I love Jacq. And that's not going to change. I'm just very confused. Have you decided on the party theme? Is it necessary? Of course. -Like superheroes and stuff? -Yes. What does Botchok like? I will have to ask him. We can also set up some fireworks. -Can you really manage? -Right at this spot… -Can we place two here? -Yes. It'll be attractive with more lights. Yes, and we can add more. Isn't this too grand for Botchok's party? Isn't this place too expensive? OK. It's not a problem because it's my first time throwing a party for Botchok, so it's my treat. Botchok is fine with Grandma Medy's cooking. He likes that. But now… This is for the child. Of course. Anything for Botchok. The people from here are kind-- No. There is something about this place… The unique smell, or… -Is it the pine trees? -Pine trees. Are you OK? Do you feel cold? Do you want your jacket back? No. Just keep it for now. Do you want to go inside? Have some coffee? I… I'll go now. -Are you sure? -Yeah. All right. Wait… There. It's cold. You might need it. All right. I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes, she's sure. OK. Be careful. Not all of us here are kind. What's wrong with you? You're drunk again. Go home! What? Didn't you have enough? Is it why you're dressed like that? Why you look like that? Enough! Our guests are asleep! I don't give a damn! -Let's just pick up where you left off. -Stop it. -Like this, don't you? -You're hurting me! -Let's just finish it! -Enough! Why don't you want me? Is he a better lover? Before, you were just begging for his help. "Help me. Help my son. My son is sick." Now you're flirting! What is your real plan? Stealing him from his wife? Dump me, he dumps Jacq? Just like that? Are you a whore? Are you? Did you really love me? Or did you just use me and you're using your sick son to flirt with him! Don't you dare bring my son into this because you don't have any right to do so! Do you know what hurts? Jacq, Edward… Everybody else can call me a whore, a slut, or a mistress. It's fine! But you? Yes, I love you. But I love my son more. We're done. Thanks for everything. -Wow! -Son, look at your cake. Isn't it beautiful? That's for you. Dance! Hey, it's Mom's turn. Eat first, Botchok. -Dad, Mom… -Mom, the towel. Yes, son? This was really fun. -It was the first time Dad's been here. -Really? It would have been even more fun if Aunt Jacq and Uncle Tristan had been here. What's important on this day is you. If you're happy, we are happy. Right? -You smile now. -Give me a kiss. That's sweet. How about me? -Oh, there! -Beautiful! Wow! Look, son! There! It's beautiful! OK, Monnet. Thank you. Are you the same daughter I raised? I don't need you judging me right now. I know what I'm doing. I hope so. I do hope so. Did you see the looks on our guests' faces? Did you see how happy Botchok was? You were a bit busy, so you might've not seen it. It was amazing! Especially when he saw his guests and the decorations. It was awesome. He was in my arms, right? I felt his excitement, I felt his heart beating like it was going to burst out of his chest… Aren't you a prick? You went to Baguio, did all you wanted, everything that could make you happy, that could make you feel complete! And then what? What then? That's it! You leave me to handle all the problems. Because that's what you're good at. Making empty promises. My son… I don't know until when I'll be with my son. I don't know how long he'll live. The son buries his mother. The mother shouldn't have to bury her son! You want to make up for it? -Do you? Answer me! -Grace, that's enough. -Save my son's life. -Grace, that's enough. -Save him! -Grace… -That's enough. -Save my son! That's enough. That's enough. -That's enough, Grace. -Save my son, please. That's enough. All right. -Please. Save my son. -That's enough. OK. Marga, I'm tired. Please. I'm so excited to go to Hong Kong. Wait. I hope we've patched things up. Finally, the problem's solved! Botchok is going to get well! This wouldn't have happened if not for you. Grace is finally pregnant. Isn't that great? We can all finally live in peace. Really? Yes. -I just had a checkup. -Wow. I'm fine and it looks like the baby's healthy. The heartbeat is strong. Thank you and to Jacq for all your help. No problem. I have to go now, it's getting late. -Baguio is a long way from here. -All right. -Thank you. -I'll see you out. -I'm on my way out as well. -You are? I'll go ahead. Thank you. Archie, where's Edward? -He is with Grace, isn't he? -He just saw her out. -You bitch! -Jacq. I warned you! Didn't I? -Face me, I'm talking to you! -Hey! That hurts. How many times did you do it with my husband? Again and again? Once, twice? Was it good? Was it? Let go of me! You're scum! -Stop it! -You're shameless! Ouch. -Bitch! -Stop it! I will kill you! I will kill you, you bitch! -Let go of me! -I'll kill you, you bitch! I'll kill you! -You're worthless! -Get away from me! Stop it! Vampire! -That's enough. -I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Damn you! You have no pity! You have no pity! My baby! -Grace? -My baby! Help! Hurry! What happened? Oh, God. What happened? Jacq? How's my baby? Everything's OK now. The baby is safe. Mom. I'm sorry. You just did… everything you had to. Will you still accept me? You're the one who lost your way. I was just waiting for you to come back. And I still am. Waiting for you. Why do you think it happened? What's the reason? There may be a reason. There may be none. But then again, there's a reason for everything. That's why we get hurt. Because we don't get what we ask for. Because there are dreams that remain dreams. That's why sometimes, you no longer know what's right and what's wrong. But it's not wrong to make a mistake as long as you learn from it. And second chances… you can choose to take them. You can choose to give them. We won't let that chance pass us by. If God doesn't give it to us, we'll accept it. What matters is us. I can't wake up in the morning without you beside me. When we grow old, I don't… I don't want to go here without you. Of course. Because… You know what? I want us to take care of each other no matter how old we are. What if I can't carry you around? -That's why! -Maybe we can combine them! No, we have a good theme. But which one do you prefer? Ma'am, you have a guest. I came here to apologize for everything I did to the both of you. I'll understand if you can't forgive me. I just want you to understand why I did what I did. Thank you for everything. I will forever be grateful to the two of you for saving my son. I made a really big mistake. I'm not sure I'd ever have forgiven myself if anything had happened to the baby. Take care of our baby, won't you? Uncle Tristan! Can I open the gift for Baby Vernon? Later, when the guests arrive. -Why did you show them the gifts already? -He was excited. Do we have enough utensils there? My baby. Did you feed him? You're sweaty! Wait a second. Vernon! Hello! Aunt Jacq! Merry Christmas! Oh, you've gotten bigger. -Your tummy's bigger! -It is. -Merry Christmas. -For good luck. -We brought some food. -Yes, we have food in the back of the car. -Thank you! -How are you? Come on. Come here! There's more there. -It is already big. -It'll come out soon. Can I kiss you? -Here's your grandchild. -So cute. Come on. -Look at it, it's beautiful. -Are you hungry? Wow, it's very big. Look, I'm engaged. -Nice, huh? -Isn't it beautiful? -Come on, let's eat. -There's a lot of food. -Tristan. -Grandma Medy. She said come on. -Oh, come here. -At last, we can eat. Thank you for the food and for all of us being together. Papa and Mama, Uncle Tristan, and Aunt Jacq. Lord, bless me and everyone here, especially Baby Vernon and Aunt Jacq's baby.
