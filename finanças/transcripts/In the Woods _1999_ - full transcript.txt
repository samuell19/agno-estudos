[suspenseful instrumental music] [thrilling instrumental music] [door smashing] - Go, go! - [Firefighter] I need a ladder over here! - [Alex] I got one, somebody give me some help! [men shouting] [voice muttering on radio] - [Firefighter] I need some help! [siren blares] - I found her! I found her! [panting] [coughing] - Alex, you okay? - Yeah. - [Firefighter] Ladder on this side. - This is what you don't learn in the classroom. - I know, how's the baby, Al? - I don't think she'll make it. - Damn! - Hey, calm down, look, you did everything you're supposed to. - We got our asses kicked in there! - Look, this house was a deathtrap before we even got here! If we would've gotten the call even a second sooner this whole thing wouldn't have happened. - That's bullshit! Look, we got the equipment! Where's their lifeline? - Sit down! - If we can't save 'em, who can? - Look, you're right, but gee, sometimes things like this happen. [Al sighs] For crying out loud. [suspenseful music] - Alex, you need a hand? Yoo-hoo, Alex? I said, do you need a hand? - No, I got it. - Hey, you better treat your equipment a little better than that. You're gonna piss Wayne off. - Oh, yeah, well, he'll live. - Yeah. [chuckles] But you might not. [Al sighs] Say, you going tonight? - Where? - Double-Vision. [Alex chuckles] - Last time I went there I got my ass chewed out. - [chuckles] Like you hated that. - [Alex] Carefully now. - Hey, you were the one buying the shots, remember? - Yeah, you got me there. - Well, besides, it's therapeutic. - Therapeutic? - Yeah, therapeutic. The whole gang will be there. - Well, Helen does have to work late at the store tonight. She had a problem with hamsters. Nevermind. I can probably use a few after this morning. - Good. [Alex groans] [people chattering loudly] - Ugh, my gut is gonna explode. - So what's this I hear about hamsters? - Hamsters? You and Helen splitting and can't find anyone better? - Have another, alright? - Okay. Hey, how about another round here for my fine, feathered friends, huh? - Alright, what about the hamsters? - Alright, you really wanna know? It's not such a big deal. The other day at the pet store, Helen got in a shipment of the little furry creatures, right, just a few hours after they were in a cage together they ate one another. [firefighter groans] - Cannibals? - I think they're called gerbils. - Shut the hell up! - Anyways, you know, she hasn't had anything like this happen before and it kinda freaked her out. - Didn't they feed 'em before they delivered 'em? - They don't ship hamsters in the first class section. - No shit, they could still give 'em some hamster food. - Hey, maybe hamsters are gerbil food. - Ahhh! - Yeah? - Yeah, you guys are brilliant. - Hey, what's the difference between a hamster and a gerbil? - Ah. You see, it's right in the curva-- - Alright, enough! Help, please. - You work with him, I don't. - Yeah, thanks for reminding me. - Thanks. - You trying to get me divorced? - Actually, we heard about this morning. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Not as sorry as I am. - I guess you just got the call too late, right? I want you guys to know that these drinks are on us tonight. - Well. - You really don't have to do that. - Just shut up and drink. - Mmm. What time is it? - [Firefighter] Quarter to 10. - Oh, man, I gotta get outta here before Helen gets home. - Just tell Helen it was your turn to get the groceries for the guys. - Yeah, she's not gonna buy that I'll tell ya. - Hey, turn it up. - Police are on the scene collecting evidence at what appears to be still another killing by this wild man who's been on a spree for the last several weeks. What has been found here is a severed finger in the front seat of this car. Police won't say if the finger belongs to the owner of this vehicle, but no matter who's it is, the fact remains another person has disappeared. Police are continuing their investigation. They have cleared the area, they are talking to witnesses. We'll have further details as they become available. This is Dick Jansen, WLDO News. - Looks like the car Pete bought his daughter a couple months back. - Oh my God. - Shit. - Where's Pete at? - He's at the station. - [Reporter] ...belongs to the owner of this vehicle, but no matter's who's it is the fact remains another person has disappeared. Police are continuing their investigation. They have cleared the area, they are talking to witnesses. We'll have further details as they become available. This is Dick Jansen, WLDO News. [Wayne sighs] - What's going on? - Get up, Pete, we need to talk. - Talk about what? - It's about your daughter. - What about my daughter? [suspenseful music] - Just come on. [crickets chirping] [knocking] - Hi, sweetie. What are you working on? You get everything worked out? - What? - You know, the gerbils. [Helen sighs] - Hamsters. I swear, someday you're gonna learn the difference. And yes, I did get it worked out. They're gonna replace them all. - Great. You know, I'd hate to think that you sold some poor little girl a devil gerbil! - God, hamsters! I swear, if you call them gerbils one more time. I'm gonna throw one in your underwear. - Ooooh! - Figures you'd like that. - Well, it's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt. - Yeah, and then it's just hilarious. You son of a bitch! You went out drinking again? God, I give up! - Helen, I just stopped in for a moment. I was just waiting for Wayne. - Who's that, your new drinking buddy? - Helen, I stopped in there to have a drink, yes! I admit it! And I don't care, we had a really shitty day. We lost someone! - Who? - A woman and her baby. - Oh, God. Alex, I'm sorry. But why didn't you call me? - I don't know. - [Helen] What do you mean you don't know? - Well, the guy's wanted-- - I don't care about the guys! Listen, is this the way it's gonna be? You limping off to the waterhole simply because you had a bad day? I know. Okay, maybe I don't know what it's like for you, but at least I'm here for you. If you'd rather kiss a Corona than me then just go for it! I can spend all night at the store talking to a lizard! - Goddammit, running into a burning building and feeding a fucking fish! How can you even compare the two? - Listen, you shithead, I can't take this. I can't take you like this. I didn't choose to marry a drunk, you put this on me. Now fix it, or I'm gone. You know, I don't feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for those people who got hurt. - Helen, those people did not get hurt. They're fucking dead! [hand slamming] Have you ever seen a baby die before? Or worse yet, cooked! - [Helen] You son of a bitch. - Well, I have and it's not very pretty. - Don't talk down on me, Alex, don't do it. - What are you doing? - What am I doing? I think it's more like what are you doing, Alex? - Come on, Helen, that's not funny. Put it back on. Come on, I'm sorry. It'll never happen again, alright? Alright, I'll quit the damn job. - I don't what you to quit. [Helen sighs] God, I do want you to quit. Quit drinking your pressures and feelings away. Don't you understand that when you wash away the pain you're also washing away me? What do you have when it's over? Nothing, Alex. [solemn instrumental music] [lips smack softly] - What now? - Are you committed to me? - Yes, I promise, I'll never go there again. And I'll stop to help you feed those fish anytime. - [sighs] Oh, God, I still don't trust those twins whatever the hell-- - Come on, Helen, let's not do that alright. - Alex, Alex, I'm sorry. You're not out of this that easy, okay? Tonight it's the couch for you. - I don't think we're both gonna fit. - No, you're right, we won't. When you sober up, I may unlock the door. [heels clack] - [Announcer] 101.5 FM on your Monday morning commute. Keep in mind, roads are backed up on I-37 again, and another hot, steamy day coming up, fourth in a row and the thermometer should hit the lower 90s later this afternoon with high humidity levels and the peak humidity could actually be over 100 today with sunny skies. It's already 74 degrees this morning at 101.5 FM. - What the hell was that? - What? - How did I get coffee all over me? - I tried to wake you, but you wouldn't budge. How else was I supposed to? - Christ, there had to be an easier way. - Ah, did I hurt your precious nose? - No. - Wayne called for you. - Did he say what he wanted? - No, just to call in before 10. [Helen sighs] [pop music on radio] Remember last night? - [Alex] Yeah, I sure do. - [Helen] I'll be home early. ♪ Eyes that look right through me ♪ ♪ While she's standing by his side ♪ ♪ Can she feel the hunger that's eating me alive ♪ ♪ Lord have mercy, take pity on this man ♪ ♪ If I fall down on my knees, if I reach out my hand ♪ ♪ Take away this craving, drain hellfire from above ♪ ♪ Release me from these fiery chains ♪ ♪ Good Lord, I've had enough, have mercy ♪ [birds chirping] - Can't you extend the cab on this thing? - [Al] Heads up. - So who owns all this land? Oh, Jesus! You crazy? [rifle cocks] - Not really, except when I have gun. [chuckles] I'm just kidding. This land, been handed down from generation to generation. The owners never let anybody hunt on it. Hell, they never let anybody walk on it. - Yeah, so what'd you do? - Hell, it wasn't anything I did. Here, kid sister married one of 'em. Easy as pie. - Oh, so they just gave you the keys to the forest, huh? - Damn straight. Nobody messes with a Higley, especially a Higley with a gun. - They don't know we're out here, do they? - Nope. - Oh, man. I'm gonna die in these woods, I know it. - Not today, Alex. Where we're going. [rifle firing] [bird screeching] - Wayne Higley, the mighty hunter. - I don't see you trying to hit anything. - Oh yeah? Watch me hit that beehive right there. - No, no, no, don't. [Alex laughs] - Got ya. - Dick. [birds warbling] - What the hell you doing? - So we don't get too lost. - That makes me feel much better. Maybe I shoulda brought some bread crumbs. So why did you bring me out here anyways? - Well, I understand that you and your wife are having some difficulty with the job. - Well, things aren't that bad. - Don't bullshit me, Alex. I didn't become fire chief overnight. I mean, I climbed up the pole, I slid down it, and I climbed back up again. I know what the job can do to some people. You've got a wonderful woman. She may not know every detail about the job, but she sure as hell ain't dumb. Try to be open with her. You don't have to go out to the bars with those other fools. I mean, listen. You come in, give me a great performance and pretty soon you'll be up there too. - Yeah, I know. Helen and I talked about it the other day. I think everything's gonna be okay. Good. Let's go shoot something. - Shouldn't we be heading back? - Nah. Hey, look. Looks like a clearing over there. Let's check that out, then we'll head back. [somber instrumental music] - What is this, Wayne? Wayne, where are we? - I don't know. - What are you doing? - I'm digging it up. - No, Wayne! - What's the matter with you? - [Alex] What's the matter with you? Come on, let's just get outta here. - Alex, you know what this is? - Yeah, it's a grave. - And what do people put in graves? - [Alex] Listen, I'm not digging up a grave. - You realize how many people are missing from this town? You want more to disappear? - Jesus Christ, Wayne, it's probably someone's house pet. A horse' or a cat or a gerbil. - What if it's not? What if there's some clue or evidence under here for the cops? Maybe the remains of somebody who is missing. We could put some family at ease knowing their loved one's not out being tortured somewhere. - Come on, we can call someone. - You know what I had to do last night? I had to wake up Pete and tell him his daughter was missing. Yeah, me. If you coulda seen the look on his face. If you're going, get outta here, I'll dig this up myself. [shovel striking] - God, I can't believe I'm doing this. - Just dig. [dramatic music] [cross crashes] [shovel striking] - Are these human? This sure as hell doesn't look human. - I don't know. - Doesn't smell too good either, whatever it is. - No, no, it doesn't. Let's do the back. - Here, let me do it. [dramatic music] - Alex. Alex. Alex! - What? - You hear that? - Hear what? - That's my point. There's nothing to hear. [creature growls] - Can we go now? - I'll follow you. [dramatic music] [fumes hiss] [dramatic rock music] - Wayne, where's the truck at? - Just keep running! [rifle firing] [rifle cocking] [eerie music] - Go, go, go, go, go! [engines revving] - Hey, what's up? - Alex, is here. - Oh, how long has he been here? - I don't know, maybe an hour and a half. He's drunk. - Must have been a bad day. - He didn't even wave to me. - I'm going to talk to him. Hi, Alex. Hi, Wayne. - We can't... We can't tell anybody about this. And nobody would believe this. - My lips are sealed. I'm too drunk to even want to talk about this right now. - I don't want people to think I'm crazy. - Give me your keys. [birds chirping] [somber instrumental music] - You fucker! [Alex groans] You drunk fucker! Barf it up, Alex! Goddammit! Adios, Alex. - Helen, wait. [door slamming] Yeah, hello. Mrs. Subner. Yeah, is Helen there? Yeah, can I speak to her please? You don't, you don't understand, um. Hello? Hello? Yeah, bye. [solemn instrumental music] [plate rattles] [engine revving] [garage door clatters] [dramatic humming] [dramatic music] [gags] [vomits] [liquid splashing] - [Larry] There you go. - Thanks. - Well, what'd you find? - Don't just shrug your shoulders, do you have anything? - Yeah, I'll tell you what we got, shit is what we've got. No, wait, we got blood and we got some ribs. All we need now is some corn and we got a barbecue. - Go out there and find something. I don't care if it's with tweezers or a vacuum. - You know, we're not just looking for shoe tracks here. - Do you know whose it is? - [Connor] Not yet. - Well, we still gotta do an autopsy. [lighter striking] - I'd appreciate you not smoking in here. It pisses my wife off. - Where is your wife, Mr. Kerwood? - She's staying at her mother's house for a couple days. - We're trying to get this resolved as fast as possible, Mr. Kerwood. If you hear anything funny or remember anything else, call us. Immediately, alright? We'll see ourselves out. [somber music] - Okay, now. I want you to take a card, but-- - Uh, tea. - I just learned this trick a couple days ago so be easy on me. - Uh, eggs. - Okay, now look at your card, you got it? - Um, is it Titanic? - [Firefighter] Hey, Alex. - Hey, Alex, how are ya? - Well, I'm tired, I have a damn headache. - [Firefighter] Want some pills? - Yeah, sure. - Don't think I'm prying, but how's Helen? - [Alex] Oh, she's fine, I'm the dumbass. - Ah, she's just pissed off because you've been hanging out at the bar again, huh? [chuckles] - Yup. - Well, she'll get over it. - I know. - This headache wouldn't have any correlation with Wayne's day off, would it? - Actually, it would. We stopped at the watering hole as Helen likes to call it after we went hunting the other day. - [Firefighter] And from what I understand, you two drank the place dry. [firefighter laughs] - What can I say, we were thirsty. Wayne catch a cab? - No, I stopped by later and gave him a ride. Good thing you had his truck. He couldn't even stand up. - You cheating bitch! - Ze dinner is served! - [Al] Ahhh. Hey, good cooking. - [Firefighter] Thanks. - So, Alex, what happened today? [Alex coughs] - [Al] That was subtle. - No, it's alright. I knew you guys wanted to ask me about it. They found a human body part at my garage. - [Al] Are you serious? - Yeah, they don't know who it is or how it got there. - Holy shit! [dispatched muttering on the radio] - How's Helen, does she know? - She's staying at her mother's. She doesn't even know about it. She won't even talk to me. - [Al] Damn. Hey, is it safe at your place? - Yeah, they're patrolling heavily and searching around the woods and everything so. Hey, listen, I'm gonna go home, alright? - Alex, if there's anything you want or need you just call us. - I will. Thanks. [dramatic music] [low growling] [creature growling] [suspenseful music] [boxes crashing] [creature growling] [boxes breaking] [man screams] - Well, where we at? - Well, we had 'em search through the neighboring woods, but they didn't find anything. All the way back to Bell's line. I'll tell you what, this guy is good. There's not a damn thing to work on. - Yeah, tell me about it. You know, it's hard to believe that some guy just waltzes in, drops a limb, and there's no clue. I mean, what is that? - We dusted, sprayed, dipped, fumed. - [Larry] Shit, what else? - We did get the canine unit. It'll be here soon. If there's anything, the dogs should get it. - Yeah, if they don't, I'll shoot them in the ass. [chuckles] - We need to talk. [phone rings] - What is it? - Not here, in the lab. - Okay, I'll follow. - I thought it best to bring this up to you personally. And privately. I know I'm a rookie and I could be wrong or simply overlooked some trivial detail, but there's something definitely not right here. - Listen, at this point I'll take anything you got. Let's see. This it? - Yup. - Oh! [Larry coughs] Ain't much to look at, is it? - My report won't be a long one, that's for sure. - Oh, that's good, that outta help. - Listen, you don't have to worry about me. Speed and carelessness will not have an effect on my protocol. I'm doing my best to help find a solution for you. - Well, look I gotta job to do, okay? I'm looking for some answers. I'd even go for some leads right now. Concrete, papier mâché, I could give a shit. It's been seven months, I've got 11 missing persons and I ain't got diddly, okay! I'm stretched to the limit. We haven't gotten any answers since this thing started so if you've got something, I'm all ears. - I'm sorry. I'm just a bit stressed out. I don't want anyone else disappearing. Just as I wouldn't want my daughter to, but I know you guys don't have any direction at this time. - Oh, is that your professional opinion, doc? - I call it as I see it. And now... I'm about to throw a big wrench into the engine. - [Larry] What is that? - To put it simply, this person was chewed to death. - What's that supposed to mean? - Oh, this for instance. This was not broken, crushed, cut or sawed. It's been basically gnawed apart. There are also punctures in the bone. I've been trying to get a match from the groove marks, but no luck. - What do you think it is? - I've been running these jaw patterns around with every known carnivore. There is nothing that matches up. Nothing. - Shit. [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] [distant clattering] [crickets chirping] [creature growling] [gate creaking] [creature growling] [Alex coughs] [objects crash] - Yes, I need to speak to Larry Gorham. [Alex panting] Yeah, tell him it's Alex Kerwood, alright? Just get him, alright, just get him! [camera clicking] - I'm gonna to make the report out, but there's nothing much. - [Connor] Have you got guys checking the front yard? - [Larry] Yeah, they just started. - [Connor] How about the neighbors, you talk to them? - Someone want to tell me what the hell's going on here? - We're working on it. - Yeah, like hell you are! This is the second time in as many days that somebody's body part's just popped up around my house! Who wants to tell me what the hell's going on? - Take it easy, Mr. Kerwood. - Oh, bullshit! Are they showing up anywhere else? - Like I said, we are working-- - Are they showing up anywhere else? - No, just here. He might as well know. And another thing. - What? - We advise you not to stay here. - I'm not leaving my house. - You can stay with my wife and I for a while. Just until this thing's over. - Only a couple days. - That's fine, sure. - I gotta call Helen. - Look I'll have my wife go by and see her at the pet store, okay? Why don't you go on in the house and grab your clothes. [Connor sighs] - Let's get outta here, it stinks. [animals squeaking] - Here's 18, 19, and 20. - Thanks. - Can I help you? - Yes, I'm looking for Helen Kerwood. I believe she's the manager here. - Yes, she is, wait a second, I'll go find her for you. - Thank you. - They don't smell too good, but wait till you taste one. They're yummy. [laughs] - Are you Helen? - Can I help you? - I was wondering if we could talk privately. - Sure, this way. - I'm Elizabeth Gorham and-- - Don't tell me, you bought a hamster from us the other day. - No. - God, I'm so embarrassed, I'm sorry. It's just that we got this shipment of hamsters in They turned out to be mean hamsters and I kinda sold a couple of 'em. - I'm here about your husband. - Don't tell me I have to bail him out. - No, nothing like that. - You two having an affair? - Oh, heaven's no! No. - Okay, I give up, what is it? - Actually, my husband's a detective. - Oh, God, I knew it. - Mrs. Kerwood, please listen to me. This is quite involved. - Well, let's have it. - For the last few days there's been even more body parts showing up around town. - I didn't hear about it on the news. - They're trying to keep a lid on it. They don't want everybody to start freaking out over this. - It's not like they aren't already with the murders. - I know it, but, oh, this would be much worse. - So what does this have to do with my husband? - The body parts have been showing up at your house. - What? - That's why you can't stay there until this whole thing is over. Alex found the remains. - How is he? - He's at our house. Why don't you come over and see for yourself? - [Larry] So, how do you like her? - [Alex] Well, the place is just beautiful especially without all the body parts lying around. - Oh, that's funny. - Sorry. So how can you afford a place like this? - I can't, my wife thinks we can. She wants to make a little bed and breakfast out of it. That's why all this scaffolding. A lot more optimistic than I am. Looks like you'd be more suited for like a murder mystery place or a haunted house or something. - Yeah. Yeah, well, it's got that Hitchcocky feel to it. I mean, it's an old place. - Kinda creepy. - Yeah, yeah, it is to me too. Listen, they're inside right now. They've been talking for a little while and I wish you guys weren't fighting. You know, I guess there've been some problems. You can't have these petty arguments, you understand? Listen, I've been trying to talk with her. She's the one who doesn't wanna talk with me. - Yeah, you have, I heard you came in the other night drunk. That's not acceptable. It's unacceptable, you listening to me? - Yeah, you don't understand though, right? - I don't care, you don't go to the bottle. - Can you just spare me the lectures and can we please go in? - Yeah, you got your shit together? - Yes, I have my shit together. - Let's go, watch your step there. All this stuff is broken up. These guys leave a mess every time they come. - This house is absolutely fantastic. - Thank you. When Larry and I first saw it, we fell in love, and all the things came with it too. We just thought we're gonna turn it into a bed and breakfast. - Oh, it's gonna be fantastic. You know, I really like some of the furniture that you got I'd really like to know where on earth you found some of this stuff. - We just-- - Hi, honey. - Hi. - How ya doing? [lips smack] - Larry, I'd like you to meet Helen Kerwood. - It's very nice to meet you. Elizabeth's told me quite a bit about you. - Anything she could tell you about me is probably true. Elizabeth, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine who just happens to be married to Helen. What a coincidence, huh? - You fool. It's definitely a pleasure. Helen's told me a lot about you. - Nice to meet ya. - Listen, we're gonna cook some grub up in the kitchen. Why don't you guys just take it easy and we'll be back in a minute. Go on, relax. - This is a really incredible house. - Yeah. - Elizabeth is really nice. - Yeah, Larry's a great guy, you know. I think he's gonna be a good influence. - On what? - On me. [Helen sighs] [dramatic music] - Boy, I'm confused by this thing, baby. I think there's more than one thing going on. I can't figure it out. - Do you want the filet mignon? - But, of course. - They're in the garage freezer. - Okay, yes, Ma'am, I'll get 'em. - I'll get them, I want to grab a pint of ice cream. - Oh, for later on when the big bad wolf comes calling. [laughing] - For dessert. - That's what I'm talking about. - I need the keys. - Oh, yeah. There you go, I'll get this done. [suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [creature growling] [Elizabeth gasps] [flesh crunching] [creature gnawing] You alright? - Ooh, yeah, we're fine. - Yeah, I see you are. - Thanks. - For what? - Oh, for having Helen and I here. - Oh, geez, it's nothing. About time you two got together. [distant flapping] Oh, God, I bet she needs help. I'm gonna go give her a hand. - Do you want me to help? - [Larry] No, no, stay right there. - He'll be fine. It's good to have you back. [Larry grunts] [thrilling music] Larry, what the hell's goin' on? [creature growls] [Helen screams] [pistol fires] [vase shatters] [pistol firing] [creature growls] [Larry screams] Helen, get the hell outta here, go! [Helen screams] Helen!

Stay tuned to this station for any news. [Alex groans] [water splashing] Wall Street continues to tumble... More news and weather at the top of the hour. [suspenseful music] [upbeat rock music] - Alex! Where the hell have you been? - [Alex] Just let me pass, alright? - You realize the cops are looking all over for you? - How's Helen? - We heard on the scanner, she's critical! - Fuck! - Calm down, what is going on? Who did that to Helen? - A big fucking devil dog! - What? - I don't know! It had something to do with the woods and that clearing and that grave we dug up! - Christ! What it look like? - I don't know, it's like a big dog or a wolf or something. All I know is it keeps dropping off body parts and bringing 'em to me! - What do you mean, like a cat brings a mouse home? - You can't even compare it like that! It attacked Helen at the detective's house so I'm going to the training grounds to try to--. - [Wayne] Let's go kill the son of a bitch! - That's what I'm trying to do so just let me go! - Get back, leave him alone! - Hey, go call the cops. - Don't move! - What is going on here, chief? - Let him go! - No way. - Who's side are you on, chief, huh? - He knows something about this shit. - Keep your mouth shut! - He's not going anywhere. - Get out of here, Alex! [Chief groans] [dramatic music] [cameras clicking] - Shit. - This is where Helen Kerwood was. The medics said she had a tourniquet on her arm. - What? - Another thing, there's animal tracks all over the place. - We followed 'em about halfway up the yard. - What about the dogs? - That I don't get. Every time we put 'em on the scent of the prints they yelp and freaking run away like they're scared or something. - Fuck, the press! - Get them assholes outta here. I don't want any pictures, articles, or interviews. If this doesn't go away, I'm holding you responsible. - Okay, I got it, Chief. I got it. - Nasty mess. - Yeah, the newspapers are gonna roast me over the hot coals for this one. - I was talking about Larry and his wife and that Kerwood woman. - What have you found? Tell me you got something that'll help me put this psycho away. I want Kerwood's hide nailed to the wall! - Kerwood? - Isn't it obvious what's happened here? Larry went to bat for this creep. Looks like he struck out. - No, Larry was trying to save that guy's life from whatever killed these two people and left body parts at his home! From what I can tell, that thing caught up with him here. - Thing, what the hell you talking about? - Like I told Larry. The killings weren't done by a man. They were done by an animal of incredible strength. - God, you're telling me that we have some killer Cujo running around gnawing the neighborhood? - Oh, yeah, I'll go right out and tell the press that our head pathologist says this was done by a killer house pet that's not satisfied with table scraps anymore. - I'm not talking about some little pet! - Oh, I'm sorry, some thing. Look, get back to your lab and find me something that I can use against Kerwood. He's the bad guy here not some fantasy robo-beast with vice grip jaws. Geez, watch a little less late night television, please. - Like it or not some big animal killed these people. And until you tell people what you're looking for a lot more are gonna die. - [laughs] Oh, God. - Oh, laugh at me if you want. I cared for Larry. I intend to see that whatever ripped him apart is caught and destroyed! - Maybe you didn't hear me the first, no press. You can't go inside. I'm sorry. - Hey, hey, put an APB out on Alex Kerwood. Consider him armed and dangerous. - Asshole! - Does he have something to do with the serial murders? [suspenseful music] - Come on. I'm waiting for you. [knocking] - Chief, the bureau is here. - Hello. - Hello. - So, Chief, why weren't we notified of these human remains sooner? - I've been busy. - We would appreciate cooperation, Mr. Pellman. - Fine, but I've still been busy. - Look, why don't you guys go out and have a seat? We'll take you out to the house in a few minutes. - We'll go now. - Have you contacted Alex yet? - No. But there was a disturbance down at the fire station earlier. - Wait. What kind of a disturbance? - They all got in a brawl. Now I've got one of them downstairs wanting to talk to you. He's got a bloody nose. - Yeah, alright, come on. [crickets chirping] [suspenseful music] [creature grunts] [lighter striking] [wick sparking] [thrilling music] [creature growling] [building explodes] [glass shattering] [Al whistles] - Hey, Al, how you doing today? - Pretty good, Marcus. How about yourself? - Alright, what are you looking for today? - Baits, I'm gonna go on a big fishing trip. - Well, I guess I won't give you the golden tour then. - Much obliged. - What can I help you with today? - Let me see this small knife. - Alright. - How about the big one? - The black one? Those are both 49.99 so with tax it would be 52.99. - I'll take the big one. - Alright, put it in a box for you. - Just a second, I need to grab another bill. - Alright. [dramatic music] Alright, I'll get some change for you. Be right back. - How you doing? - Fine. - What's in the bag? - None of your business! - I think it is! [men grunting] Give me the bag! - Stop! Stop right there! Right now! - Give me the bag! [gun fires] - Goddammit, I said stop! - Marcus, he's the killer! I just saw some fingers fall out of his bag! - [Marcus] Open the bag, Al! Don't you fucking move, man! [dramatic music] - God. You son of a bitch! [birds chirping] [somber instrumental music] [voices chattering distantly] [phone ringing] - Police. Stay there! - So where'd you put 'em? - Wouldn't you like to know? - As a matter of fact, I would! - There's really nothing left for you. I make it a point to make 'em unrecognizable. - Except one. - Who? Who was it? Which pretty young thing? Was she special? Your daughter? - You're a sick puppy! - You're all expendable. - We're talking about the mess you just left for us, a couple in their home, ring any bells? - I don't know anything about that! - Listen, you've been very forthcoming with us so far so why don't you just tell us about the Gorhams and tell us about Alex Kerwood, all right? - No, who? Who? - Your accomplice, that's who! Come on, who do you think we're talking about here! I've got evidence here that we've found at his house that puts him at the crime scene. - I, I. - Quit lying! - I don't know no Alex Kerwood! Nobody helped me! I did it, I did it all! I picked 'em! I killed 'em! - We know about Alex Kerwood! - I did it, I picked 'em, I killed 'em! - Well, thank you very much. Good, good, that's all we wanted to know. - Alex is at his house. - What? - He just called us. He wants us to go down there, sir. - [Murderer] Nobody helped me, piggy! - Shut up, man, you're fucked, alright? You're fucked! We're gonna go down there. Why don't you stay here and watch this fucking thing here! - Let's go! - Don't move. Don't even breathe. - Can I have some Wheaties? [birds chirping] - And blew it up? - Yeah, I blew it up. - So I send somebody over there, they're gonna find animal parts all over the place, right? - What I just tell him? I told you, I blew the whole place up! - You know, it seems a little funny to me. You leave Larry's place, leave your wife laying there almost dead in a pool of blood. - Someone had to stop that thing! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Those people all died because of that big fuckin' dog. - Yeah, right, killer Cujo, yeah. - Hey, listen, I know you don't believe me and you know what? I personally don't give a shit. - Listen, Kerwood, we're gonna get to the bottom of this one way or the other. - Oh, yeah, and the sooner the better for me because the sooner you find out that I didn't kill these people. What does it look like? You think I just went in there, chewed off my wife's arm? Just tore these people apart? I mean, get real with this whole thing! I know it sounds a little farfetched, but it happened! Well, you don't have anything to worry about, Chief, because I took care of your problem for ya. How's Helen? - She's stable, not awake though. - She started to come around so I had them give her something to sleep. We thought it'd be better if you were there when she came to. We thought it'd be easier on her. - Let me get some coffee, alright? - Yeah. - So what do you think of this clown's story? - I'm gonna send some guys out to check it out, but it stinks. - I'll say so, killer dogs? [dog barking] He claims this creature attacks these people and then he lures [dog whelping] it out to the fireman's training ground and blew it up? - [Connor] That's what he says. - [FBI Agent] This guy's certifiable. I mean-- [glass breaking] [horrific screaming] [agent screaming] - Move. - Get it outta here, man! Shoot! [gun firing] [creature growling] - [Connor] Son of a bitch! [agent groans] Shit! [gun firing] [creature growls] [swords clanging] [creature growls] [knocking] - Just a second. [knocking] I'm coming! Jesus, what the hell? - It's still alive, Wayne. - What? I thought you were gonna blow it up? - I did blow it up, but the thing... I don't know, it's still alive though. - Shit! - We've got another problem. - What? - There's another monster. I mean, it is huge this thing. It walks on two legs. It must have been what chased us out of the woods. - You got to be fucking kidding me. - [Alex] No it killed Connor. - Connor? - And two FBI agents at my house! I mean it broke through the window, it just tore 'em all up! - How'd you get away? - I don't know, it didn't kill me. It lifted me up in the air and it showed me how these things were created in my mind. - What the hell are you talking about? - What I'm walking about, Wayne, is that hundreds of years ago these creature things, these killing machines, they were created by sorcery and used in some sort of battle between two roaring kingdoms. [dramatic music] [swords clanging] [men grunting] [swords clanging] [man grunts] Anyway, the tall creature killed that dog and buried it out in those woods. But then we dig up that grave, Wayne. Now that dog thinks that I'm it's master! But the big tall creature thing wants to kill the dog again! - Slow down, Alex. - No, you're the one who took us out to those woods. - Wait a minute! - I told you I didn't wanna dig that thing up, but you-- - You helped! - You said that-- - You helped. - Well, now you're gonna help me! - Help you how? - Well, it showed me the empty grave so now all we have to do is we lure the dog out to the woods and then we lure it back to the gravesite. - And that's your plan? - Yeah. - We're gonna ambush a monster? - We have to destroy this thing, Wayne, and you helped. We were out there together. It was you and me, and I said I didn't want to do it, but you have to help me with this problem. Come on, Wayne! - Alright! People are dead! - Alright! [suspenseful music] [Wayne sighs] We've been here for hours and nothing. Maybe you did kill it. - I didn't kill it, I just pissed it off. Like I said, it will come here. - Well, I'm tired. I'm gonna make some coffee. [creature growls] [objects crashing] [rifle blasts] Alex, take the bike! Take it to the woods! [Wayne groans] [dramatic rock music] [water splashes] [suspenseful music] [fire crackling] [creature growls] [flesh crunching] [Alex screams] [fabric ripping] [creature screeches] [Alex groans] [dramatic music] [Alex groans] [creature screeches] [Alex groans] [creature howls] [Alex groans] - Alex, where is it? - It's dead. Where the hell were you? [Alex groans] - Are you alright? - Where the hell were you, Wayne? - The cops showed up right after you left. They asked me a million questions about you. - Yeah, what'd you tell 'em? - I didn't tell 'em anything. - I gotta splint this. God, you're freezing! [Alex coughs] You put your shirt in my truck? - [Alex] Yeah. - Well, that'd been great if the cops had seen this! Put it on! - [Alex] I don't wanna put it on. - Put it on, you'll freeze to death. How do you know that it's dead? - I told you before, I can feel the thing. I've got a connection with it. I don't feel it anymore. It's dead, Wayne! - There you go with that feeling stuff! I don't understand how you can say that you can feel when it's not alive? - I'll just explain it to you later, Wayne, alright? Can we just go now? I really would like to get the hell outta these woods. [Alex groans] See Helen. - Come on, get up. Stand up. - I can do it! - Come on. - Yeah, we just injected her so let's try to hold off dinner for about two hours if we could. - [Alex] I wanna see my wife! - Hey, what are you doin' in here? - It's his wife, it's okay. [monitor beeping] - I battled my demons, Helen. I beat 'em. You gave me the strength to do it. I'm never gonna leave you, never. I'm gonna take a leave from the fire station and I can come help you at the pet store. And you can show me the difference between the gerbils and hamsters. [Helen groans] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - I know. - I love you.
