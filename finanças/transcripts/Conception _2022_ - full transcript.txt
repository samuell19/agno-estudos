[pleasant instrumental playing] [Vic] All right. Hit me with it. Is being a consultant, what you plan to do long term? Yes. Next question. No. Elaborate. - Please. - Oh, you want the high school essay version? Yes, 1000 words or less, please. I'd like to start my own agency. Right now, we make the big companies richer, and small companies just can't afford us. So, I'd like to change that. That's a great answer. I love that. I think you should definitely do that. But if we're going to play this little game, I want to make it a little more interesting. Every question you ask me, I think it's only fair that you answer the question yourself. That's fair. I want to be the first woman at my firm to be partner. They say that women are only good at interior design and the basic stuff. Well, I'm going to show them. Wow. Kick ass and take names. I like that. I see no problems with that. Although, I think it's really funny that you never let me ask you the question. I mean, you just went right into it. That's how excited you are. I am excited. I have had a lot of guys waste my time, and I guess I'm just over it. [Vic] That bad, huh? You couldn't imagine. Hmm. I'm in a phase in my life where I just want a glass of wine and a great conversation when I get home. Well, lucky you. I'm an expert conversationalist, so I will never bore you. Never? Sounds committal. Hey, look, I play this game to win it. But I actually don't like how you're doing it, though. You know, if you're going to hit someone with the 21 questions, you got to do with a little more flair. Panache. What do you mean? All right. [clearing throat] Oh. Are you about to do your whole consultant thing on me right now? Give me a second. [laughs] Oh, this is going to be fun. Hi. Hi. God, I can't take my eyes off of you. I mean, all of that is... Is beautiful, but... I'm really talking about your eyes. [Vic] There's just so much there. Like what? I look in your eyes and I see someone who is profoundly intelligent. Most men don't see that. They see how beautiful you are, and I bet they can't get past that. Which is why, if I had to guess... your relationships don't last. Interesting. You're funny, but not overly funny, like Kevin Hart. Like low-key funny that goes under the radar. But I notice it. I dig it. Do you? [Vic] Oh, I think you're hilarious. [laughter] I'm going to go out on a limb and say... only child. And what makes you think that? The way you walk and talk. The way you carry yourself. You seem like someone who's... really self-sufficient. Like you don't need anyone else. Well, that's wrong. I could need you. I think you want me. I don't think you need me. I like this game. Well, that's it. All right. How much of that was right? Surprisingly, a lot. But I do want to take one thing back, though. I do think you need someone. I see a void, but... I can't quite put my finger on it, though. Well, I guess that void, as you call it, which is very, very perceptive, by the way, is because I am an only child. You're right. As for what I'm looking for in someone is... [Vic] Love? Not quite. I want all the love. I want the love that comes with the big family. I never had that. So, I guess I... You covet what you don't have. Yeah. Pretty much. Well, that explains a lot about you. And nothing about you. Me? Nah, I'm easy. What you see is what you get. I thought you would have figured that out by now. I don't know about that. There's a lot more to you than what meets the eye. You want to know more about me? I do. Hmm. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. We're not doing that here. [alarm beeping] [clattering] Hmm. Hmm, get up. You get up. [hangers clattering] What? Nothing, I just never get tired of seeing you naked, so. Will you stop? We're going to be late. [drink bubbling] Oh, thank you. See you tonight. - Hey. - Yeah? You're beautiful. I want you to know that. Where's this coming from? Nowhere, I just... I know sometimes I forget to say it, so, you know. Is this from earlier, when you were peeping at me? Peeping... Don't say peeping. My God. No, I just... Look, you see your wife half naked in the morning and you know, things start to happen and you know. Know what? I mean, come on. You know. What are you thinking? Okay, so what I was thinking is that maybe tonight we could, I don't know, try some stuff. What stuff? Stuff. You know, stuff. So... so I saw it in a magazine and... No, I read it. I read it in the magazine. - What magazine? - No, it was... It was one of... Like, one of the big ones. You know, they have, like, so many of them. Thank God you're so easy on the eyes, because sometimes, I just don't know about you. [door shutting] [city noises] [man] People are going to get tickets. It's a fact of life. What I want is to be the first call they make when they get a ticket. We got to get ourselves out there. We believe in what we're doing. Now, it's about increasing awareness. We have the talent and we're already helping thousands of people. But we could do better. So we hired an outside consulting firm, and they're here to help us. So, make them feel at home. [keyboard clattering] Since when are we doing small companies? The heart of this country runs on small businesses. If we don't help them out, then who will? Whatever you say, boss. - What? - Hand me that pack real quick. - Seriously? - Stop it. Again? You know this isn't healthy, right? No, no, I swear I quit. Just a deep breather once in a while and... And I'm good. [woman] You got issues. Just use the patch or something. No, no, no. See. Right now, I'm on cruise control. I'm loose. Relaxed. Hey, Vic. Can I talk to you? Yes. Yes, you can. See how that works? What? No. Just call them and let them know. Okay. Hey, we got a problem. [papers flapping down] Apparently, this wall is load bearing. No, no, no. That ruins everything. I wanted to open that whole space up. What do you want from me? Nothing. Just give me some time and I'll figure it out. ♪ [knocking] You're still here? I don't want to be, but I'm having trouble with this one. Oh, my God. I haven't seen him since he was, like, half that size. - Say hi, bud. - Hi. All right, head to the elevator, man, I'll be right there. He's big now. It's big enough to get into fights at school. And that's a whole thing I'm dealing with. What do you got going on here? [grunts] The electrical and the aesthetic. They left it open for me to do. Contemporary chic, yada, yada, yada. You know, you're really good at figuring everything out from here. Don't worry about it. You'll get it. I just feel like everything I've come up with is just boring. It's contrived. Not the least bit inspired. Ah, so inspiration is what you're seeking? Yes and... And no. I don't know. I'm exhausted, it's late. You look tired. Go home. - Please. - Fine. - Hey, can I ask you a question? - Yeah. [Ami] You don't want another one? Hmm. I did. I did. And then, you get divorced. And then well, that's that. Yeah. Sorry, I didn't... [man] No, no, no. You're good. What about you and the husband, right? Kids have to be coming soon? They are. We just planned to finish some more of our goals, and then we'll get to it. [man] Ooh, I've heard that one before. - I'm serious. - Hmm. A word of advice. Do the family thing sooner rather than later. All right? Just trust me on this one. All this will still be here, whether you focus on you or not, okay? Hey. Where are you going? I need your words of advice and wisdom. I can't leave that kid alone for too long. He's a troublemaker. All right? You know when they're little, hmm, they're the best, all right? But when they get bigger, they turn into little shits. You'll see. You'll be fine. Good night. Good night. [sighs] [door sliding open] [rummaging] ♪ You're looking at baby pictures? Yeah. I haven't seen them in a while. Yeah, I was a really cute baby, wasn't I? Not looking at yours. I'm looking at my pictures. [Vic] Rude. Ready to go? Yeah. [lively music] - [bartender] Here you are sir. - [Vic] Thanks, man. Appreciate it. All right. Thank you. - I'm really glad we did this. - I know. I'm glad you got off work for once. It's just this project, I swear. [Vic] I know. But, hey, I wanted to ask you something. Yeah, what's up? Have you ever thought about when you want to have kids? Um, not really. I mean, honestly, I thought you'd bring it up when you were ready. I guess I was always waiting for you. We don't need to hurry or anything, but, you know, it is something I want to get to. I mean, I guess last time we talked about it, we were dating and... Yeah, I guess these last few years have really flown by. Yeah, we never really sat down and talked about it, huh? [Ami] Do you want to have that conversation now? Yeah, of course. Or what do you think? I mean, is now the right time to do the whole baby thing? It's been on my mind lately, but I kept telling myself, "No, just wait a little more. Get this done. Get that done." But, honestly, right now is the perfect time. I can wrap up the project at work, free up some time and we can figure out this new phase in our life. If you're ready. We're gonna have to make a lot of changes to our life. Are you sure you're okay with that? Well, what kind of changes are we talking about, Ami? I'm kidding. Babe, I'm kidding. You know I love you. I know I make a lot of jokes, but at the end of the day, that's all they are. They're jokes. If you want to start a family, we'll start a family. Let's start a family. I am excited to take the kids to Disney World, though. I mean, it gives me a reason to go to Disney World. [Ami] You're too much. Hey, hey, what's the name of that... That tall dog with the long ears? Snoopy! [city din] [Vic] Who said anything about being practical? You asked about what I desired most in life. That word, desire, I mean, it's a strong damn word. So an extraordinary love to you means making love around the world. All right, when you... When you say it like that, yeah, of course it sounds stupid. [laughs] But we're not just talking about ordinary love. We're talking about true love. And not just the physical stuff. All right, you know what, I can see it in your face. No, we're done talking about me. [laughs] You mentioned that love to you is having more love than you had growing up. Tell me about that. Growing up, it was just me and my parents. They were always working and I found myself wishing I had siblings. As I grew older, I knew I wanted a big family. They always look like so much fun, you know? I remember a lot of lonely and quiet nights and... just don't want that ever again. Which is why I was going to ask you, but didn't get to it. What are your thoughts on kids? Do you want them? You know, I have lots of nieces and nephews. And... and I adore the hell out of them. I'll do anything for them. I just want a life of... no regrets and all love. And if kids fit into that, then... yeah, I'm all for it. That's a good answer. No regrets and all love, huh? I like that. I can be with that. [Vic] God the 'burbs are so far. [Ami] It's not that bad. God, look at all the space. Who needs all this? Uh, everyone? You don't feel cramped in our apartment? - No. - I do. We can't keep living like that. We've got to move out at some point. Yeah, I know, I know. But look, you've got to understand, men, we don't need a lot of space. I mean, I'll be fine in a small, 600 square foot apartment. In fact, I can cram my entire life into one, tiny, little carry-on. Men are weird. No, we're efficient. [laughter] - This neighborhood is gorgeous. - Yeah. When it's time, I want to move out to a place like this. Yes, whatever you want, babe. Plus, we both know you're the boss here. I'm just the chauffeur. Shut up. Hey. I know we're going to see their baby and we had that talk last night, but there's no pressure or rush, you know. Let's just talk to Adam and Vanessa and get a feel for how everything's going for them. And then we can see if it's right for us. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good plan. I'm on board with that. But you got to tell yourself that, though. - Oh, come on. - No, no, no, no. I've seen the look in your eyes. When you see babies... What? No. [gentle music] - Hey. - Shh! Yeah, yeah. That's a really cute baby. Hey, on a scale of one to ten, how cute do you think our baby would be? Don't say that. [Vic] Like a seven? I mean, come on, look at me. Look at you, we'd have an adorable baby. Maybe like a 9.4. I mean, it wouldn't be a ten. Ten's a unicorn baby, those don't exist, so. Will you stop? [laughter] Let's have a baby. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive. ♪ Although... it is a bit of a dick move to say no pressure. And then show me a really cute baby. I mean, that's not really fair. Don't say dick near a baby. You just said dick in front of the baby. [whispering] Aw, shit. Ami, stop cussing in front of the baby. Just shh. Is it weird that we're just staring at the baby, though. Yeah. We should probably go. Yeah. Are you watching them on the baby monitor? They're having a moment. Leave them alone. You know how we were when we wanted to have kids? - Are they still there? - No. Oh, wait, here they come, shh. Did you just shush me? [Vanessa] What did you guys think? She's adorable. No, seriously, guys. I mean, congrats on the baby. The house, the huge yard. I mean, all of it. [Adam] We needed it, the kids run all over this place. Trust me, you need to give them their space, otherwise, they start destroying walls. Destroy walls? [Adam] Well, drawing on them and the occasional hole here and there. [Vic] Oh, Jesus. You know, I think you're right. I can get used to this. [Vanessa] Honestly, I was hesitant about moving out here, but... honestly, I love it. [giggling] [Vic] Oh, don't go putting that in her head. Look, we don't need that kind of negativity in our lives, all right? Do you honestly hate all this? I mean, just listen. It's so quiet out here. No, no. Give me the sound of highway traffic any day. And I love that it smells like homeless people outside of our building. It's got a bit of a charm to it. - [Vanessa] Ew. - Don't mind him. He's being dramatic. Where's the older one? He's across the street at a sleepover. That's the only reason why we had time to ourselves today. You're okay with random people watching your kid? It's a community. Whenever they want a few hours to themselves, they drop their kids off over here. It's a good system. Guys, this is all great. - You have the perfect setup. - You have to. We're not as mobile as we used to be, so you have to create your own little slice of heaven. But you guys don't miss the action, as you know, being in the city? Yeah, you just get used to it. I mean, we miss the pop-up restaurants, the hazy nights. - We miss it all. - Yeah, but mowing lawns, taking out garbage cans, turning out sprinklers, I mean, - this... this is your jam now? - Would you stop? Do you see why I didn't want to bring him out here? Oh, it's all right. He's just not in his natural habitat. He's being defensive. Like a turtle going back into his shell. Yeah. I'm right here, guys. [laughs] Nah, we're just joking. Come on, guys. Let's cheers to this moment. We're glad you guys came out. And next time, we'll come out to your neck of the woods. - Salut. - [all] Salut. It's great. [smooching] - I love you. - I love you. [hopeful music] ♪ ♪ I got organized. Excuse you? I have a plan on how we're going to do this baby thing. Do you now? I thought that making a baby is pretty easy, you just get naked, and anything that happens after that is pretty much up to you. And I guess you can get creative with it if you want. You know what? We'll just have this conversation when you can take it serious. Okay, okay, I'm being serious now. Are you sure? Because I can go find someone else to have this baby with. Yes, 100%. Please continue. So I downloaded this pregnancy app that tells me what days will give us the best chance of getting pregnant. - Oh, that's pretty cool. - Mm-hmm. I finished my period a few days ago, so that means the best window is the next week. Like the whole week. - Like... like every day? - Mm-hmm. Oh, man. I knew I was going to love this whole baby making thing. Okay, hey, show me the app and the schedule. Yeah. So it tells me what days I'm ovulating. Mhmm. [smooching] And at that point, that gives us a six day period that gives us the best chance, what... Are you listening? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, we for sure have to do it on these two days, but then, after that... Where are your hands going? I don't know. Where are they going? Well, today is one of those days. I know, I saw the schedule.

Oh, oh! - [smooching] - [giggling] [smooching] - [Ami] With the socks on? - With the socks on. - [Ami] What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing? [door creaking open] - Hi. - Is it my birthday? All right? So, it's like the same thing with, like, soup, right? If you're hungry, people usually have soup. But did that satisfy their hunger? - I mean, that depends. - Or did that satisfy their thirst? Well, what's in the soup? Because I think... - I mean. Yeah. - If it's just soup, you know, it's going to satisfy my... Tomato basil. Well, I need some substance in it! That's substance, it's tomato. But that's the thing, right? Are you no longer hungry or are you no longer thirsty? I mean, I think that I'm going to be hungry if there's not, like, - actual stuff in it, you know? - I know, I know. [sighs] You better enjoy this babe. You know, once those kids come, we're not going to have these spontaneous dates anymore. I know. I'm loving every minute of it. Question is, are you okay with this? Ames. You forget I'm a man of rather simple tastes. - [Ami] Oh, ho, ho, ho really? - [chuckling] Look, honestly, I don't need much. I need you, some travel. That's pretty much it. Good. Because life is going to be very, very different. As long as we're on the same page, we'll make it work. See? There you go. [Ami] When do you want to tell the parents? Maybe we don't say anything until you're actually pregnant, you know? Yeah, you're right. They're just going to overreact. And the last thing I want is my mom nagging me about every little thing. "You should be doing this to get pregnant or this or rub this herbal concoction all over your body," it's too much. You know I can't handle that. Your mom's little jabs are like nails on a chalkboard for me. Ugh. Maybe we won't say anything until we actually have something to tell them. Yeah, I like it. Did you do something different with your hair? No. Why? I don't know, it just looks different. Thought maybe you changed something. Uh-uh. Maybe it's the way the light's hitting it but...

No, like a proper one. - Proper one? - Okay, fine. Not a proper, but, like, a more manly beard. A more manly beard? Did you just say more manly to me? Oh, my. Would you look at that? We got to go.

Where are we going? ♪ [music fades] - Hey. - Hi. - What do ya got there? - The test. - The test? - Yes. - What's wrong with you? - No, nothing. I just... I didn't know we were going to do this today. I would have... I would've kind of prepared myself, so. I haven't gotten my period yet, but, you know, just to make sure. I was going to test it in the morning. Why not right now? They say that you should test it in the morning. It's the most accurate then. Does it make that big of a difference, though? Or we can find out right now if we're having a baby. Would you like for me to test it right now? Well, I mean, if it's not too much trouble. Yes, please. You are way too excited about this. - Yeah. Why aren't you? - Fine. What are you...

Let's shoot powder out everywhere. - Gross [laughing] - I'm just being honest. You know, in the beginning, it was fun, but... But now it's just weird to do when you're not in the mood, so. You're telling me? Of course it is. You could try to set the mood, you know, instead of just going right at it. Yeah. All right. Point taken. [sighs] So we slow it down a bit. Switch it up and, uh... try to bring the romance back. That sounds perfect. Yeah. [water streaming] Is there anything else I can get my beautiful wife? You know, I was thinking. We can't raise a kid here. There's no space. I think we should really look into buying a home. Financially, we're at the right place, and maybe it's the right time. I mean, I prefer to stay in the city. Mm hmm. Don't you think we should at least wait until you get pregnant first? No, I don't want to do the whole move while I'm pregnant. It'd be easier if we did it all before the baby came. I can have it organized. [sighing] I don't know, babe. I think we should wait. Come on. You know, this is my area. I want to design and decorate the whole place. I can have it all done in a week. You know that. Yeah, no, I know. And good. Because I don't like to do any of that. I know it's a lot to ask, but...

Is the big, strong man afraid to do some work? - Psh, I can move boxes babe. - Uh-huh. And I'm actually a little insulted that you would think otherwise. On second thought, I'm going to take a nap. No, no, no, no, no, no. - No. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. I've already seen the proposal, so it should be okay. As soon as they see it they got to take it, 100%.

You got cold feet. Refused to jump out of the plane. The pilot had to give you fruit snacks, to get you to calm down. I remember that. Trust me. I'm fine. Okay. Let me get dressed and we can go. - Okay. - All right. Good. [lips smacking] [Vanessa] So are you doing anything for Halloween? Ugh, I don't even know. What are you doing?

This is the stuff I really love about being a mom, it's like, you tolerate the bad mealtimes and the sleep issues because this stuff is so much fun. [laughing] Oh, God, I want that. Ugh, I just want that already. You know, like... [sighing] How's it going? Oh, we've been trying for a while now, and it just hasn't happened yet. Doctor says it's normal in the first year, though, so. How long have you been on the pill? Ugh, I don't even know. Like, since high school, maybe. Yeah. Same as me. It took me a while to get pregnant. It takes the body a few months to reset itself. Yeah, that's what she told me. So, don't let it weigh you down. It'll happen. Just... trust the process. I am. I'm not worried. I know I'll get pregnant. It has to be in the cards. You know, like, it wouldn't make sense if the universe says I'm not meant to have a baby. I just... I can't accept that. You know? There's plenty of options later down the road. You're going to have a baby one way or another. I'll make sure of it. And that's why we're friends. We don't take no for an answer. Hell, no, we don't. Why are we still drinking coffee? Girl, I don't have the kids for the day. Let's go get a real drink. It's two in the afternoon. What's your point?

That's what I've been telling you. Me, a razor and your neck is where we should draw the line. Yeah, 100%. That was an assassination attempt. - [both laughing] - [water rippling] I think we should go see a fertility doctor. Uh, let me guess. You already made the appointment. Yeah. I figured. You always do everything without talking to me first. You know, I don't mean anything by it. First few times you do it, yeah. But when you start to do things, and don't even talk to me first. It starts to feel like we're not even in this together. And that it's just you. It's just that we've done everything we can. I think it's time we let the doctors do what they do. We've been trying for almost a year now, and it just hasn't happened yet. And I agree. Let's do it. But, just talk to me first, all right? Tell me what's going on with you. We're supposed to be a team. I'm sorry. I just... I get so focused. Babe, you are not in this alone. It's us together. It's okay to forget about everything else. Just... don't forget about me. I know. I know things have sucked lately. Clearly. We've got a basket full of negative tests over there. And I've got this monstrosity on my face that you made me grow. We're not working well as a unit right now. The beard is sexy. Trust me. Hey, if you say it plays, then all right. It does. Now if you're not going to shave, let's wipe you off.

What does that even mean? [laughter] I'm really glad you guys invited us out tonight. We haven't seen you guys in a while. It's not their fault, we don't get into the city much.

Now I'm with you on that one. Uh, hey, excuse me. Can we get one more bottle, please? Yes, sir. One of us still has to drive. That's why I have my husband. He'll drive us home. My wife, ladies and gentlemen. I'm just trying to enjoy myself. These moments are rare. You guys will see it for yourself. I hope so. Silence is precious these days. There's always screaming and crying. Especially now that there's two of them. Oh, you guys are doing such a good job selling parenthood to us. You can't have the good without some bad. Trust me, it's worth it. How's Dr. Barry been? We've heard nothing but good things about him. He's been really great through this process. We actually go see him tomorrow. Did you guys do that thing? - IUI? - Yes. Yeah, we did. We find out tomorrow if it worked or not. Did you know Samantha and EJ did that same thing? Oh, really? Then you guys have nothing to worry about. It worked for them. Oh, hey, that's great news, right? Yeah, it is. [Vanessa] Aw, look how cute they are, Hon, worst case scenario, you can have one of my kids. Oh, my God. I might have to take you up on that. I mean, to be honest, I'm just kind of ready for it to happen. You know, it's... Baby sex just isn't the same. - It isn't the same. - [Ami] It can't be. You're on a schedule. They don't understand that. I mean, don't get me wrong, you know. In the beginning, it's fun. But, you know, after a while it just feels... - Feels like a chore. - Excuse you? Like you're going through the motions. Oh, my God. Yes. I wish it were any different, but that's just how it is. I'm just glad we're done with that phase. At a certain point, you just can't, you know? It's like I'm shooting powder out, man. - Jesus! - Don't get him started on that. Can we get the check, please? No, babe, they got to hear this. No, they don't. Thanks for tonight. [Vic] I'm just glad you agreed. I know things haven't been great lately, but, you know, you... You've really been on it, taking your meds and doing everything the doctors asked to do. You know, I just... I wanted you to have one night, you know, away from it all, you know, and... No, it was... it was perfect. I was completely in the moment tonight. Regardless of what happens tomorrow. Don't. Let's not focus on tomorrow. Let's focus on tonight. Yeah?

No, your results are not in yet, but we will have them for you as soon as we get them. And I'll call you back. Yes. Thank you. Have a great day. Hi, Dr. Barry. How was lunch? It was good. How does my afternoon look? Yes. You have Ami and Vic Shaw in your office right now. And I will have Susan uh, come and give you your schedule afterwards. Great. Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. - Hi. - Hi, doctor. So we've been having trouble getting pregnant. We began balancing out your levels of estrogen and progesterone, and the two of you tried to conceive with no success. We then adjusted your dosages and you tried again with no success. At that point, I recommended we progress to IUI, intrauterine insemination. Which is what we did. And it was unsuccessful. What do you mean, it didn't work? Why? We don't understand exactly why, but that is common in this space. How is that common? I mean, you guys have labs and tools and... this is all science here, isn't it? Well, pregnancy is not an exact science. The best way I can explain it is it's like trying to hit a moving target. It's actually quite difficult. Now, IUI, with the help of fertility drugs, which is what we did, generally has a success rate of 8 to 17%. 17%? That's like nothing. Why did we even do it then? It's cheaper than IVF. Doc, can you just explain in layman's terms why this didn't work? Essentially, her eggs rejected your sperm. Her eggs rejected my sperm. I'm sorry. I didn't know her eggs had the option to... to swipe left on me. I'm sorry, Doctor. What are our options moving forward? Well, you just mentioned it, and I think that's the next logical step. Invitro fertilization. - Okay. Invitro? - Absolutely. Just tell us what we need to do and when we can start. This isn't something to rush into. IVF is very expensive and it's mentally and emotionally taxing on a couple. So please take your time and do your research before you decide to move forward. [somber music playing] [sighing] [music fades] Look, I'm really sorry. I don't understand. Okay. But what if we meet our deductible? Well, that's ridiculous. Yeah. No, uh, thank you for not helping. At all. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. No, uh, not really. So IVF is considered an elective procedure, so the insurance isn't going to cover it. It's going to be all out of pocket. Same with the medications. Okay. You know, babe, this is going to be very expensive, and it's going to eat a large chunk of our savings. What are you trying to say? Well, I think we should at least... We should what? Uh... Nothing. It's fine. I'm just thinking out loud here. The doctor said to keep our spirits and body healthy. I took my vitamins and I'm going for a run. You should do something productive. Didn't you say you wanted to put planks in the attic? I did say that, didn't I? Hmm. Oh, and we should do a juice cleanse this week and detox ourselves. Yeah. No, it sounds great. Okay. [door slams shut] Juice cleanse. ♪ [water streaming] [breathing heavily] [Vic] Hey. Guess who got tomorrow off? Figured we could spend the day together and, I don't know, do something we haven't done in a while. I've got to get some stuff done in the morning and get a workout in, but after that, I am all yours. How was your run? Babe? Ames? Yeah. [Vic] How was your run? Oh, it was fine. Are you sure? You don't look okay. Yeah. I think I just pushed myself too hard on the run. I don't feel okay. [Vic] Want me to get you something? No, it's not that. I just... I don't feel okay up here. You think it's the meds, maybe? I do notice you space out a lot lately. No, I don't. [Vic] Well, I mean, a little bit you do. I know my body. I'm fine. We go see Dr. Barry in a few weeks. So, I'll just ask about it then. Okay. Yeah. Let's change the topic. I'm going to get some dinner, do you want some takeout? I'm not hungry. You sure? Yes. I think I'm just going to lie down for a bit. [blankets rumpling] What are you doing? I don't know. What are you doing? I figured I'd just lay down with you for a bit. Well, everything looks fine down there. Are you sure? Anatomically, everything is fine. Your eggs are perfectly healthy and viable. His sperm count and quality is high. So, it's not you and it's not him. Then, why isn't it happening? I apologize. We just don't know. Now, it may not make sense, but it is common for two healthy people to be unable to conceive. All we can do is adjust our approach. This is so frustrating. So, what do we do now? Well, your labs came back and you're a little under your hormone levels, so I'm going to increase your medication, and I want to start you on progesterone injections. I know you prefer taking the capsules, but I need you on the injections. Okay? I understand. And I'll do it. Don't be intimidated. The needle is wider because the oil is thick and it's longer because it needs to get deep into your muscle. That's a good thing it's not a suppository, huh, Doc? Stop it. Not right now. Please continue. There are two ways to inject this. Two-person system involves him injecting you in the meat of your glute. The other has you injecting it into the middle of your thigh. He won't be able to handle this. I'll do it myself. Also, I had a question about the medications. From time to time, my brain starts to feel, I don't know if it's the right word, but foggy? Is that normal? Unfortunately, yes. As we keep adjusting your hormones, you may start to feel not quite yourself or not comfortable in your own skin. If it gets to be too much for you, you let me know and we can make some changes. Is there anything I can take to counteract all that? I'm sorry. No. Now, moving forward, you really need to pay attention to your body. Mood swings, night sweats, weight fluctuation. You could experience all of it or none of it. Now, if it gets to be too much emotionally. The clinic works with a therapist who specializes in this area, and I highly encourage you to talk to her if you need to, okay? Now, I'll step out and let you get dressed. What the hell is wrong with you? I know. I'm sorry. Is everything just a joke to you? Take this seriously. You're right. Just trying to lighten the mood, and it was bad timing. He's trying to help us. And all you can do is make dumb comments. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm going to let you get dressed now, okay? [sighing] Sorry for the wait. Got you ready. Yeah. No worry about it. I haven't seen you in a while. You don't come out any more. Well, when you've got two kids, it's hard to get out of the house. Don't get me wrong, we love it. But I haven't seen the inside of a bar in, like, eight months. I guess that makes sense. How's the baby doing? She's learned to walk. Correction. She's learned to run. Holy shit. A running baby. Exactly. She won't sit still. She's like a magician. She'll disappear like that. She'll pop up on the other side of the house. That shit is crazy. Like a little Houdini. Okay. [laughing] I bet it's so much fun, though. Trust me. You guys aren't far behind. You'll see for yourself. Yeah, I hope so. Real quick, does she know how to use the meds? Yeah, I think they went over everything at the doctor's office. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all this medical stuff. That's kind of Ami's territory. It's okay. The stuff is confusing. Oh, what's the damage? Take a look yourself. - Jesus Christ, Marie. - I know, I know. These medications are just that expensive. I mean, tell me there's like a friends and family discount. Come on, we go way back. Not that far back. Did you at least put a fidget spinner in there? Court side seats or something. I mean, I got to get my money's worth somehow. I have lollipops that I give to the kids. Do you want one? Come on. Yeah. I'll take one. [Marie] Take all you want. This is good. Thanks. I don't know. In all honesty, my card might decline here. No, it's okay. Ami already called ahead and paid for it. She did? Nah, this card has too much on it. Aw, shit, she probably opened up another credit card. Are you all right? Yeah. Um, hey. Thanks for everything. - See ya. - I better. Where are my keys? I swear, you're always touching my keys. How many times do I have to tell you to hang them up? What's going on? Where are my keys? I don't know, I was out there drinking coffee. I've told you time after time to hang up my keys and you don't. What if I needed to be somewhere and I couldn't find them? Have you ever thought about that? It would be so much easier if you just did what I told you to do. Instead, you always wanna question everything. It's so annoying. Babe. Your keys are in the sink. [sighing] [keys clattering] You know, it's taxing, to say the least. No one said this would be easy. This is incredibly difficult for a couple to go through. You need to make sure you're being 100% transparent with what you're feeling. Are you? When we started this, she was happy and optimistic, but... And then the medications really just started to take a toll on her body and... really affecting her mood. I mean, lately, it feels like silence says more than the words can. [therapist] That's understandable. If it's this hard on you, just imagine how hard it is for her. Men and women process these obstacles differently. Yeah, and you're right about that. You know, on these meds, I mean, her mood swings are just... And they're intense. It'll only get worse as the therapy continues. You know, I wish she would just consider alternatives to IVF. [therapist] What does she have against it? I don't know. But I feel like I can't even bring it up to her. I'm honestly a little afraid to even go there with her. Perhaps is not the right time to bring it up to her. In fact, don't worry about that conversation until you get there. If this cycle of IVF works, you're pregnant and you guys are done with that phase. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Now, what she needs from you right now is to be supportive of her. And I want you to hyper focus on that. I want you to wake up in the morning, look at yourself in the mirror and say, "Be supportive." That's it. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really understand. I want you to have the mindset that you're going to be supportive of her in every way. Channel that into every interaction with her. No matter how big or small. Okay. Just, you know, be supportive. I can do that. You know, but, I mean, what if... What if that's not enough? ♪ [clicking] [wincing] [wincing] [wincing] [knocking] Oh, sorry. [Ami] No, it's fine. I'm finished.

And on the good days, I'm hopeful I'll get pregnant and it'll happen for me. And on the bad days. I can't help but think, "Why me? Why can't I get pregnant? What's wrong with me?" [therapist] Don't do that. An unsuccessful IVF is very common. It's also common to feel this way afterwards. You cannot let yourself spiral downward like that. I'm fine. I promise. My mother taught me to be resilient. I'm going to take a month or so and get my mind and my body right. And we're going to try again. [therapist] You don't owe anything to anyone. Society would say different. A woman who can bear a child is considered damaged, right? I don't care what people say. This is what I want. I've always wanted kids. And I'm not getting any younger. The older I get, the higher the chance that IVF will fail. My birthday is in a few months and I'm going to try again before then. This is just as much mental as it is physical. If you stress yourself out, it will manifest physically. I see it all the time. Women take it so hard on themselves that each and every attempt at IVF then fails. I'm strong enough to do this. I'm going to keep a positive attitude and it will happen for me. You remind me of a patient I had. She was so positive and determined. She wanted kids so bad. Her and her husband failed twice, but it didn't matter to her. She remained positive. I mean, she did fertility massages, acupuncture, whatever she can do to create a positive outcome. Did she? On her fourth try, She did. She now has a lovely baby girl. That's it. That's what I want. I want that strength. It's more than just that. I mean, she sacrificed a lot. She quit her job. She...
