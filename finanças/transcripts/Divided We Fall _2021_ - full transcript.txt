What I gotta do, I have to finish this. And this is one of the reasons why we're having this conversation instead of a different one. What would be the different one?

I look up at the fucking camera, my nigga. Yo, these bitches is in my crib, hammers out, my nigga, creeping, my nigga, so you know me. I grab the fucking full barrel. You know what I mean? Go to open the door, this bitch is like this. Nah, son. When did this shit happen? Slams the door, my nigga. Starts banging in the fucking crib. I'm banging, doom, doom, doom, doom. Yo, that shit's crazy, son. Throws that shit to the ground, my nigga. Grabs the motherfucking mat, I'm like, yo, this shit too small. Throw that shit on the floor. Grab the fucking chopper, my nigga. Yo, boy, my crib turned into fucking Iraq, my nigga. Yo, it's funny you should say that about these bitches, son. You know, a couple of months ago, man, in the barbershop here, I'm cutting hair, this chick roll up on me asking me something about the gambling spot. You know what we do in the back. Yo son, let me tell you, that night, I'm back there rolling dice, man. Lose all my money, go to the back and said fuck it. It is what it is. All of a sudden, I'm hearing gunshots in the back. In the shop? - In the shop, son. - Wow. So I cracked the hammer. You know I keep that thing on me, right? All right, all right. I see some bitches running out. I caught that last bitch. You know, I laid her ass out. As you should, my nigga. You steamed the shit out that ho. Now listen, I'ma tell you what it is, man. Some bitch named Keisha and she rolling with a fucking bunch of dyke bitches. Like, this is what them bitches do, my nigga. But it's kinda my fault. I created this monster, you know what I mean? But yo son, I'm here if you need me. Yo, keep your head to the ground, my nigga. All right? Stay up. That's what's up. Look, the feds, they want any and all information on those girls linked to these homicides. Mainly, they're interested in a robbery that took place in the full day and an undetermined amount of cash taken from that jewelry store. They wanna see you in an hour. Damn, so it's an undetermined amount of cash. From a jewelry store? No tape, no jewelry taken? They didn't take nothing. Yeah, that's the feds. I knew that was them. Man, you already know. Anderson! Pleasure to meet you, Howard. I've heard nothing but good things about you. Same to you, sir. All right, all right. Enough introductions. Look, I need you guys to go out there, get these bad guys, or rather girls. Look, be safe. I'll see you guys later. How are you doing? I'm looking for Agent Smith. How's it going? I'm Agent Smith. How you doing? I'm Detective Howard. This is my partner, Detective Anderson. Boss man gave us orders to come down here and help you with whatever you need. All right, nice to have you aboard. This is my squad over here. How you doing? Agent Lewis. Turner. Agent Cruise. KB. Yeah, so I mean, hopefully this a two way street and we'll get to put an end to all this. What we got so far. Our prime suspect is CoCo. Hm? Nah, uh-uh. Angel of Death. Everywhere she go, death follows. Really? Interesting. What about the rest of them? You guys know any of them? I mean, I might have seen them, but Keisha right here, she attached to at least three homicides I'm investigating. Baby, what's up? Of course. Listen. I'm in a meeting right now. Let me get back to you. Yeah, I got you. All right, listen. I'ma send you the address. Yeah, I'ma cook us something special tonight, all right? I'll see you later. Well our primary suspect is CoCo, and we're certain that she is the leader of the pack. I saw all four of those girls together while I was undercover at a pool party, but I don't have any names for the other girls. So you guys been onto the group? Not the group, just the individual. So our plan is to be part of your team, infiltrate the whole organization and find out exactly who they work for. Who they work for? Yeah, from all the intel that we've been getting, we're finding out that this girl, Coco, had to have somebody much bigger in the picture. Couldn't have done it by herself. Any leads to her whereabouts? KB has the leads. It ain't much longer before he find out everything we need to know. We're gonna help you any way we can and we expect the same in return. That's what I like to hear. So I suggest we go ahead and pick up the homicide suspect and start putting the squeeze game in play. That's what we do. Put a little fear factor on these dudes, you'll start getting all the information you want. All right. Sounds like a plan. All right, bet, let's get these bitches. - Let's get it. - All right. Stop. Everything good? So where we going? You're not even talking? I don't know where I'm going? I guess I'm just rolling the dice, huh? Either gonna be a head cracker or an ace. Let's roll, baby. He's with me. Yeah? Yeah, he good. Hold up, hold up, hold up. Yo Po, you know this guy? Yeah. What's up, mami? What's up? Sha, this Po. What's up, my nigga? What's going on with you, man? How you doing? Welcome to Miami, man. You good? Yeah, I'm great. That's what's up. This is my city, man. Those Haitians, you know what I'm saying? Everything good with you? Everything great. That's what's up, man. You know, my girl Carmen, man, she been sending me a lot of great things about you, man. That was a good job, Carmen. It's kind of funny because this is the first I've ever heard of you. Yeah, well you know what time it is though, you know what I'm saying? A nigga like me, man, you gotta keep a low pro, you know what I'm saying? Like super low profile, you know what I'm saying? But yo, it's all good bro. You're here now. You're here with me, so I'm gonna make it happen, man. It was hard getting here. I got searched about five times. Thought I was coming to see the Pope. Yo, like I said, man, low profile is the key, brother. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah, so, I'm sure she filled you in already, so let's get to the business. This is how I'm gonna do this. You buy 10 pieces, I send you 30. I buy 10, you send me 30? - Yeah. - What's the catch? Catch is, it's every two weeks. Consistent. What you think about that? At the number I'm getting, 30 pieces every two weeks. Every two weeks. I mean, that's a little challenging, that's hard. I mean, I'm sure it's not the 30 pieces, my dude. That shit sells itself. Is it the price? At the end of the day, I think you're a pretty smart dude. You ain't talk to him? I'ma leave that to you, Papa. Aight, man. I think it's the price. This is what I'm about to do. I'll take $5,000 off these bird. What you think about that now? If you can take five grand off each bird. - Each bird. - We're in business. That's what's up, brother. Only problem now, you have some problems I've been hearing about. I mean, it ain't nothing for me and my niggas to take care of, you know what I'm saying? I got that taken care of. You supply the food. I got that. I like that. I like that. So we waiting on you then, man. Sha, my man. Let's go. Can I go now? I mean, you could go now. Okay. Benny, I'm leaving. All right, well, have a good night. Who do you know? Who do you know? I'm going to start doing whatever I want. When I am satisfied, I'm going to ask a question. If I get the remote inclination you are lying to me, I'm going to make what I was doing before look like fucking hand holding. So, she talk? Nyet. Vika! Don't kill her yet. Go get my chair. Okay, easy. All I want to know is who did you tell about duffel bag? I don't know. Okay, enough. Enough of this. If I have to get up from my chair, I am going to cut your fingers off one at a time. Just tell me what I need to know. I don't know. Just tell me what I need to know and you can go home. Okay, okay, I'll tell you. It's Talib. You see? See how easy that was? Now, I want you to tell me everything that I need to know about this Talib. Okay. Very good, my dear. You see? I didn't want to cut your fingers off anyway. No, please! Use the hammer. No, no! Yes, it's me. Look him up. So some little monkey Talib hired some little monkey whores to the- yes, to the bus. Yes, I know, but look. Listen. It took me less than 24 hours to figure all this out without the help of your little bitch. You need to let me stay for good. So I will find this Talib and I will find these whores and I'll be back before Sunday. Fine. Fine. Yes. Yo, snap out of it. See, this is my grimy ass cousin, Muffy.

No, you don't understand. I'ma keep it 100 with you. What the fuck was you expecting? The picket fence? The motherfucking house on the prairie? This life you living wasn't given to you. Your mom's a G, your daddy ain't never coming home. You're bugging. Like what the fuck was you expecting? You don't understand, this man showing me a whole different lifestyle. Something I never seen before, like I ain't ever have to resort back to the streets ever again due to this man. Yo, shit happens for a reason, and in every worse situation, you gotta take the best elements out of it and concentrate on that. What the fuck are you saying? Fuck it. Let me speak in your language, all right? Speak English. You gotta take the good with the bad, Keisha. You know that. At this point right now, I'm going through a lot. I got niggas after me, bitches after me. I don't even know which way to go at this point.

Your Honor, it appears that my witnesses are dead. We believe Mr. Coleman arranged all of this. Objection, Your Honor. Mr. Coleman has been locked up for the last two weeks. What is he, a magician? Your Honor, Mr. Coleman is the head of a murderous drug gang. Your Honor, even if all of that is true, I think that the prosecutor should have arrested him on all that. Need I remind the prosecutor that we're here for a grand jury proceeding, not an arraignment. Listen, he's right. We're not here for hearsay about Mr. Coleman. We're here to see if the prosecution can show forth evidence why Mr. Coleman should be indicted. - But Your Honor- - But Your Honor, we do have evidence to show. Order! Miss Robison, if you have no one to come forward, I'm bound by law to dismiss this case because of lack of evidence. We just need time to find more witnesses. Your Honor, as pertaining to Clyde versus the State of New York, subtitle B, paragraph 34. You have to dismiss this case. Your Honor, we do have evidence that has shown everything in our favor. In addition, our witnesses just magically disappeared without actual evidence. I have no further choice in this matter. Your Honor, we request a non-release waiver. I suggest if you have so much information about the defendant, you make your next case a stronger one. Case dismissed. Holding is full. Take him to the pin. Hey, Coleman. To the gate. That's me, that's me. What up? Where my motherfucking lawyer at? Step back. This way. Yo, what up with shorty? How'd that turn out? Oh, had a ball. Oh my god. Yo, yo, yo. My boy. Bugowt, what up?
