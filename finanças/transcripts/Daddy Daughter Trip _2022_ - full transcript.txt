(knocking on door) - Hi. - Hi, did you order some sushi? - Oh, thank you- Hey, what happened to my sushi? Did you run over it something? - Oh, no, I didn't run over it. I slammed on the brakes and it slammed into the dashboard. But that's a good thing because this way you're able to see all the ingredients in the sushi. A lot of times these sushi restaurants try to rip you off by leaving out that little chunk of avocado right there. And now this way, you know you have it. - Dude, you just stuck your finger in my sushi! - Yes, that was a mistake. And if I could do it all over again, I'd use a chopstick. - I'm not paying for that, moron. (door slams) (soft upbeat music continues) - [Employee] Chicken, chicken, chicken. What combo you pickin'? - One box combo, please. - [Employee] One box combo. See you around the corner. - [Larry] Okay. - This isn't my house. What are you doing? - Yeah, you were on your phone. I didn't think you'd mind. Just trying to make a living here, pal. What are you, what, what are you doing? - Giving you one star. - I'll just pick up the food. (Larry sighs) (tires squeal) (passenger grunts) - How's it going, Ed? - [Ed] Hey, Larry. - Thanks a lot. Two more stops and I'll get your home, pal. - [Passenger] What? (school bell rings) (soft upbeat music) (children chattering) (soft upbeat music continues) Ooh, time to pick up Meara. (car sputtering) (dramatic music) (soft upbeat music) (car honks) Sorry. Sorry. I just gotta- (car honks) A little help. A little push! - Meara. Let's go inside and call your mom. - Okay. (car honks) - There he is. - Daddy! (Larry grunting) Daddy! - Hi, honey. How was school today? (Larry panting) - It was great. I made you another drawing! - I love it. It's, it's amazerrific. (Larry grunting) - Did you come up with a new invention? - Oh, not yet, but I got a new idea. It's, it's kind of a car seat where the kid steers and the daddy pushe Okay? let's try it. All right. (Larry grunting) Make a left at the next right. (teacher sighs) (teacher mumbles indistinctly) (soft upbeat music) Hi, mom. - Hey guys. - [Meara] Hi, mom. - Hi, babe. - Mom, I made you this drawing. - This is so good, Meara. I love it. Thank you. - Ooh-hoo-hoo, what smells good over her - [Megan] Chicken pot pie. - Ooh. We can eat it with my new invention. - [Megan] Oh, good. - Where is it, where is it? Oh. (soft quirky music) - Cool. - Honey, this is your math homework. Weren't you supposed to turn this in today? - Yeah, but I don't like math. I like drawing. I'm gonna be a cartoonist, not a math person. - And I think you're gonna be the greatest cartoonist in the world, but you're gonna need math to count all that money you're gonna make. That's why you need to do all your math work. - Hey, that's nice. - Dad didn't have to learn math to be an inventor. - Yes, he did. You need geometry and engineering to make it all fit. That's math. I can't wait to hang it up on the fridge after you turn it in. Why don't you go start your homework and I'll let you know when dinner's read - Okay, mom. - We got a really talented kid there. - I know. She's gotta do all her schoolwork, thoug All she wants to do is draw. - Yeah, but if you don't follow your dreams, babe, that's like a stomachache for your whole life. - I'm not saying not to go after your dreams, but Meara's eight. By the way... What did you do to Meara's hula hoop? (mechanical whirring) - Hm? (mechanical whirring) (mug shatters) (mechanical whirring) This cools the soup so you don't have to - Your dad's a genius. A spoon with a fan attached. - Yeah. All right. Put on the fan, honey, so you don't burn yourself. (fan whirring) (soup splashing) (Megan gasps) - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. - No, obviously I need to make some adjustments. It's just a prototype. (Larry clears throat) Here, let me adjust your fan for you, honey. I'm gonna reverse it here. Hang on. (mechanical whirring) (soup splashes) - Oh. - Sorry. Let me get you, sorry. Sorry. (chuckles) - Dad, I'm just gonna blow on it. - Don't support my competitor. (Meara blows air) (soft quirky music) - So, are we gonna get to go somewhere f for spring break this year? - It's just... I'm sorry, honey. Mom and dad are trying as hard as we can I just don't think we can afford it this year. - But you promised last year we could go - I know we did. - Look... Last year, I flat out lied to your face. I'm sorry about that. But hey, champion, next year we're gonna go somewhere great. I promise. Definitely. - One of dad's inventions will take off by then, for sure. - Mm-hm. - I'm not hungry. Can I be excused? - Sure, sweetie. (soft melancholy music) Did you see the look on her face? We have to do something special for that girl. - I know. You're right. And we will. I'm just one invention away. I feel it. - And I know you're going to do it, but until then, I think you should apply at the grocery store. They're hiring baggers. We could use the extra cash, for Meara, especially. - I don't wanna work at a grocery store. That's like telling the universe I give up. - Hey, I work at a grocery store, you big jerk. - Look, you're a cashier. That's a highly respected position in society. Everybody knows that. I'm talking about the guy five feet away from you, who puts the groceries in the bag. You know, the guy that really gave up. (fan whirring) (soup splashing) Okay, I deserved that. - We have $602 in the bank, Larry. That's only enough for half the rent this month. - All right. I'll go down there, but I don't wanna get the jobs just 'cause you work there. I wanna get it on my own. - Of course, and you will. You're a Buble. - You're right. We're Bubles. We're winners. - [Megan] You got this. - Megan basically already got you the jo - She did? - Yeah. - Here. I just need your signature. - Well, just so you know, I'm only looking for part-time work because I'm an inventor. - And I'm a ninja. My star throwing competition is next wee - Well, I'm gonna get back to my inventions. It's what I do. Invent. - Frank, I can't thank you enough. We'll give you 500 bucks. - No, no, it's not necessary. I mean, I'm just doing it for a friend. - What? Take it. Please. - No, it's, no. That's not why I do it. I just like to help people make money, then I feel good. - I know, but look at this. Look at all this. Here, take a few hundred dollars. For me so I don't feel bad. - Okay, I don't feel comfortable, but thanks. Okay. - Eh, I just have so much money, I don't even know what to do with it. (soft upbeat music) - Um excuse, excuse me! Excuse me, sir. What is it that you do? - Oh, well, not much, I'm afraid. I'm independently wealthy, but if you have money, it's nice to be able to help people. Well, I mustn't stay here chattering. I got people to help. - Well, what, how do, how do I get to be one of those people? - Oh, well I can make you rich like I made the other guy rich, but the problem is you have to have an incredible startup idea. - No, I do have an idea. It's for camping. A hoop for privacy, when you have to go. - It's called the Hula Poop. - I like it already. - Let me show you. - Sure, let's look. (upbeat music) So, this is the Hula Poop. I love it. Brilliant. This is gonna make you billions. Now, the only thing you need is a patent - How do I get a patent? - Well, from the Washington Patent Office, you see. Now, if we had some money, we could set this ball rolling now. Hey, there's an ATM machine right behind you. (soft upbeat music) (machine beeping) Thank you. - Can't wait to tell my wife. What? (tense music) (Frank laughing) - [Frank] What an idiot. (both laughing) - Hey, wait! Where are you, hey! (tense music) Darn it. (soft music) (soft music continues) (students chattering) - Count down to spring break. This is exciting, guys. I wanna hear all about your plans. Um, Liam? - My family and I are going canoeing. - Nice. How about Emily? - Me and my family are going ziplining. - Awesome. And you, Valerie? - Me and my family are going to Bearizona Wild Animal Park and we're going to Butterfly Wonderland. - Great. Meara? Tell us your plans for spring break. Do you have plans, sweetie? (soft music) Meara? (soft music continues) - Uh, me and my family are going ziplining. - Uh, Santiago? - We're going canoeing. Um, Butterfly Wonderland. And we're also going to Bearizona. - That's, that's great, Meara. (children laughing) Kids. Be nice. (children laughing) - Meara said she's going ziplining and to Bearizona. What a liar. - You don't have the money to go canoein Your dad delivered food to my house. - Maybe her dad works the zipline. (children laughing) - Listen up, poop faces. (dramatic music) Meara's going to all those places. And yes, I deliver food to your parents because your dad's clinically depressed and can't leave the house. Okay, bye. (upbeat quirky music) Come on. Don't worry about those kids. They're meanie kids. (insects buzzing) - We can't thank you enough for letting us stay here, Karen. - Oh, it is my pleasure. It is a delight to have the two of you stay with me. - Well, the three of us really appreciate it. - So, this was your grandmother's house? - Yes. It's been in my family for a hundred years. - Whoa. - You can tell. New homes don't have that old lady smell You gotta earn that. (insects buzzing) - Mom, Dad? I'm scared. I don't wanna sleep all by myself. - Oh, honey, I'll come sleep with you. - You got a real good mom there. Okay, get some sleep. See you in the morning. Love you. - Move over! (Larry grunts) I just got kicked off my couch. I gotta warn you, I fart in my sleep. - I can sleep through anything. - A lot. (Karen farts) (Karen farting) (Karen continues farting) (Karen continues farting) (insects buzzing) (Karen continues farting) (Larry sneezes) (Larry sneezing) (insects buzzing) (dog farting) Oh, come on! Ugh. (dog continues farting) (insects buzzing) (quirky music) (Larry grunts) (Larry farts) (soft music) (Larry yawns) - [Megan] Good morning, sweetheart. - Morning. (phone ringing) Hey, dad. - Hi, honey. How's my little girl doing? - Good, I'm drawing. Can you tell me one of your stories? - Um, let me think of one. Once upon a time, there was a cookie that loved to complain. (Meara laughs) - I like it. - When the mommy was baking him in the oven, the cookie complained. - It's too hot in here. Take me out. - [Larry] So the mommy took the cookie out, but the cookie complained again. - I'm not done yet. I'm still soft in the middle. Put me back in. - [Larry] So the mommy put the cookie back in. - It's too hot again. - [Larry] The cookie complained. When the cookie was done baking... (timer ringing) The mommy took him out. - Now I'm too cold. - [Larry] The cookie complained. So the mommy put him in a cookie jar with the other cookies and the cookie complained again. - Get me out of here! I can't breathe. I got all these cookies on top of me! - [Larry] So the mommy put the cookie on a plate on the counter and the cookie complained even more. - How come you guys get to watch the TV? I'm just stuck on a plate. - [Larry] So the mommy moved the plate so the cookie could see the TV. Still the cookie complained. - How come you guys get to sit on the comfortable couch? (Meara laughs) - [Larry] So the mommy put the cookie on the couch. - [Cookie] How come the dog is closer to the TV than me? (Meara laughs) - [Larry] So the mommy put the cookie right in front of the dog and the cookie complained again. - Now I'm too close to the TV. - [Larry] And then the cookie complained one last time. - I don't like the way that dog is looking at me. - [Larry] Then the dog ate the cookie. (Meara laughs) (upbeat music) - That was so funny, dad. - I can't wait to see your drawing of it - Dad? Can I ask you something? - Sure, honey. - When are we moving back into our own house? - Hopefully soon. - Did you mean what you said at school? - What's that? - Are you really taking me on spring break? - Of course. We're gonna go zip lining, canoeing, Butterfly Wonderland. We're gonna go to Bearizona. (electrical buzzing) (Larry yelling) - What's happening? (Larry yelling) (Larry coughing) Are you okay, dad? (Larry coughing) - [Larry] I'm fine. - [Officer] I'm giving you a ticket. - Hm? - I'm so excited! - I'm so excited. - I'm gonna go pack. - Bye. (windshield wiper pings) - Uh, I'll tell you what. How about I don't give you the ticket and you don't make me pay for this? Have a nice day, sir. (electrical whirring) (hand slapping) - Hey! Ah! (Larry yells) (Larry choking) Officer!

You hopefully are starting in a week. - I am? - You do realize we're living at my friend's house, who hates your guts? - I wanna do something special for Meara And why does Karen hate my guts? - That's not important. What's important is how are we gonna pay for it? - Look, I did pretty good today. Check the tip jar. (Larry mimicking mechanical whirring) - Honey, you have seven dimes in your bucket. - Two of those sounded like quarters. (sighs) (Larry mimicking mechanical whirring) (Megan sighs) - Larry, please, just don't break our daughter's heart. (soft music) - I won't. I promise. - I'll see you back at the house. At my friend's house. (soft upbeat music) - [Receptionist] Boo-bel? Bubble? - It's Buble. It's got a little thing over the E. - It's called an accent. - Oh, I don't have an accent. I'm from here. Anyway, I'm here to donate blood. - Mm-hm, okay, second door on the left.

He's a Canadian. That's probably why his music hasn't reached here yet. - Right. - Okay, round two. Let's go. - Mr. Buble, you can only give blood onc or you'll start to feel weak. Someone at the front will give you your $40. - Are you sure? 'Cause we're ready to go - I'm positive. - Sure? - I'm calling security. - All righty, it's a shame 'cause it's ready to go, this one. - Yeah. - A faucet, this one. (Larry whistles) - Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

That looks like an airplane. - It's an airplane? No, behind the airplane. - That's another airplane. - Behind those two airplanes, there's a star, and I love you all the way to that star. - That looks like a UFO. - It does look like a UFO. - Thank you. I love you all the way to the end of the universe. And it has no end, so you just have to keep going, until you get to the farthest part of the universe and back. - That's pretty far. I love you all the way to the end of this universe and then to the next one and then the next one and then back, a thousand times. Infinity. (Meara chuckles) - I love you all the way to the hood of the car, to the windshield and halfway back. - That doesn't seem like as far as what I was just saying. (Meara laughs) (Larry laughs) I love you all the way from my nose to the hair on my ear... - Ew. - And then back to the third booger in my right nostril. (Larry laughs) - Excuse me.

They were strong. - We'll still have fun, okay? - I don't think that's the name of the drinks, but you are right, I should drive. - Stay right here okay? I'll right back. Excuse me. - [Bird] Hello. - How do I put it in gear? - You just press the button under the steering wheel. (car starts up) - Oh, there you go. - Hey, you dropped your- (dramatic music) (Larry thuds) (Larry thuds) (Larry grunts) (Fernanda gasps) - We have to call an ambulance. - [Santiago] No. - Why not? - Maybe he's okay. - We just run over him! - We? You. - Shh! (bird squawking) - [Bird] Hit by a car. Hello, hello, run over. Hello. (quirky dramatic music) (bird vocalizing) Hello. Run over. (dramatic quirky music) (dramatic quirky music continues) - [Employee] You can't go that fast! (dramatic quirky music continues) - Shh. (dramatic quirky music continues) - Oh, you guys came back early. - Thank you, Jeanine. What a great recommendation. - Wow. You guys ate fast. - Yes, we just had the appetizers, which were marvelous. - Oh, let me clean up. - No, no, no, don't worry. We like it dirty. - My phone. - Oh, stay away from your phone. - Well, let know if you need anything, please. - We don't, thank you. (Jeanine yells) (Fernanda panting) (Fernanda screams) - Shh! (Fernanda yells in foreign language) This is bad. We're gonna get sued. That's where Americans do, they sue each other. - Maybe he won't. - Do you know in America, if someone breaks into your house and drowns in your pool, they can sue yo - That doesn't make any sense. How's the person gonna sue you if they're dead? - I don't know all the details. But listen, if he gets a judgment against us, we could lose our work visas. We won't be allowed back in the country, most of our followers are here so we could lose everything. We can't let that happen! - No! (banging on door) (Fernanda gasps) (Santiago yells in foreign language) - Shh. Shh. (tense music) - Is my dad in there? (Santiago laughs) (Fernanda grunts) - Hi, honey. - Hey, dad. Are you okay? - Oh, completely. 100%. - Um... (Fernanda speaks in foreign language) Can I offer you something to drink? (Santiago speaks in foreign language) Not you. - Ah? = What kind of tea would you like? - Oh, I'm a big fan of all teas. The afternoon, midday, sleepy time, deto And if I don't have any plans, I might even go for a smooth move. (Santiago sighs) (Fernanda exhales sharply) Let me come over there and get it. (Larry thuds) (soft music) (birds chirping) (soft music continues) - Are these your drawings? - Yeah. (soft music continues) - What's this story about? - This is a story about a boy who had too many birthdays. - What happens? - Once there was a boy who wished that every day would be his birthday. - [Theo] Every day? - [Meara] Yeah. The first day all of his friends came to his birthday party and they all brought him presents. He got everything he wanted. He even got to eat three pieces of cake. The next day when he woke up, it was his birthday again, only this time, only half of the friends came to his birthday party and only a few of them brought presents. There was cake, but he only felt like eating one piece this time. The next day he woke up, it was his birthday again. But this time none of his friends came to his birthday party and the thought of eating any cake made his stomach hurt. By the time two weeks had passed, he didn't even wanna go to his own birthday party anymore. When he went sleep that night, he made another wish that it would not be his birthday every day. He woke up the day and he got his wish. But unfortunately for him, because it had been 14 days of birthdays he was 20 years old, and now had to go out and get a job... (toilet flushes) As a school janitor. (Theo chuckles) - My daughter's really having fun with your son. - It's so nice to see him playing. He hasn't been himself for a while. - Yeah? - He's our nephew. Both his parents died in a terrible mountain climbing accident in the Himalayas. - Himalayas? - Mm. - I heard a lot of good things about the Himalayas. Until now, of course. (clock ticking) How did I get in here? - You hit our car with your face. But it was an accident, so we completely understand. - Don't worry, we're not going to sue yo We don't do that kind of thing. You don't do that kind of thing, do you? Suing? - Why would I sue you? - Exactly, why would you? (chuckles) - Then again, you guys do seem kinda ric (Larry laughs) (Santiago and Fernanda laugh) (Larry groans) - I can see how it looks that way. - I'm just kidding. But seriously, how much you think I can get if I did sue you? (Larry laughs) (Santiago and Fernanda chuckle) - We don't have a lot of money. We're just travel bloggers. We write reviews for hotels. That's why they put us up in the nicest room. - The company we work for pays for all of this. - Yeah. - Maybe I should sue the company that you work for. (Larry laughs) Your faces are priceless and the eyes are... (Larry laughs) You got... (Larry laughs) (Larry sighs) (soft music) Bearizona? Butterfly Wonderland? Ziplining? These are all the places Meara wanted to go on spring break. - We are taking our nephew to all these places to write about them. - Oh, lucky guy. - Now I know what we can do for you. - Yeah? - What if we go to all these places... - Uh huh? - And after- - Yeah? - We'll let you know what a great time we had. - Oh. - [Santiago] And you can see the pictures on our blog. (Fernanda speaking in foreign language) (quirky music) (slap thuds) - Or maybe you can join us. - Come with us. - That would be amazerrific. Let me go tell Meara. Meara! Meara! - Amazerrific?

Party for five. - Ooh, yeah. (soft orchestral music) (people chattering) - Fancy. - This is very fancy. - After dinner, we get in the car and drive away. - Santiago, no, no, no, no. We can't just leave them here. - Well of course we can. We are not responsible for their entire vacation. - Santiago. - He jumped out of a tree today so he can't sue us now. He's obviously 100% recovered. I have the video on my phone. (Fernanda scoffs) - Hey. - [Santiago] Do you want wine? - Oh uh, psh. Yeah. - You choose the kind. - No, no, no.

What? (water splashing) (diner gags) - Thank you. Sorry. Ladies. (diner gasps) - Wha... (quirky upbeat music) - Take that. Dad? Do you wanna play? - I'd love to, but they just sewed my thumb back on 30 minutes ago. Thumbs are important. What separates us from the apes. - Yes. Dad, apes have thumbs. - Well, let's agree to disagree. All right, let me in there. (Fernanda sighs) - [Meara] Yes. - Come here. - Which one am I? - You're the one losing. (Fernanda exhales) - What were you thinking? He's gonna take everything we have now. (Fernanda scoffs) - Me? You were the one who ordered the champagne. - Seriously? - Think about this. You don't have to worry because we are friends and friends don't sue friends. (Santiago sighs) - Friends don't cut off other friend's fingers. (Fernanda whimpers) Come here. (soft music) (soft music continues) (soft music continues) - [Meara] What is that? - This was my mom's scarf. It doesn't smell like her anymore. - I'm sorry, Theo. I made you another drawing. - [Theo] What is it? (soft music continues) - It's a monarch butterfly. Have you heard of them? - No. - The monarch butterfly lays her egg under a leaf. The mom only lives for two or three week but her dream is for her baby to fly even farther than she did and to have fun. - But, but why would she leave? - 'Cause she knows that one day all the butterflies will be together again in paradise. - Why do you draw? - It's like the opposite of math. I love it. What do you love? - I don't know. I never really thought about it. - Did you have fun today? - Yeah, I did. - Good, 'cause if you said you didn't, I would've hit you with this. (Theo and Meara laughing) (pillows thudding) - Hey. What's going on here? Time out! Give me that. All right. Time out over! (Meara and Theo laughing) (Larry grunting) Watch the thumb. - Time out!

(Fernanda chuckles) (soft ethereal music) - Look at the beautiful mountains! (soft ethereal music continues) - [Larry] Okay, Theo, say somethin'. - What do I say? - Anything. - Can you hear me now? - Nope. (mic tapping) - Can I see those? - These? (soft music) - These are excellent. So do you come up with all these? - Well, my dad tells the stories, then I draw them. We're a storytelling team. - Oh. Oh my god, I think other children would absolutely love your stories and drawings. - I hope so. I'm gonna be a cartoonist when I grow up. - Well, Meara, I can't promise anything, but the woman we work for runs a book publishing company. We're meeting her tomorrow on her plane and I think that she might like this. Who knows what could happen. - Really? That was be amazerrific. (Fernanda laughs) - I love that word. (upbeat Spanish music) (Santiago speaks in foreign language) - This is my favorite song. (singing in foreign language) (upbeat Spanish music) - Hey, baby. (singing in foreign language) (Theo and Meara laughing) Yeah. (singing in foreign language) (Theo and Meara laughing) Hey, baby. Oh, we had a terrific time. - Oh, I can't wait to see you guys. I'm glad Meara had a good time. - Yeah. - You made it happen for her. Thank you. - Ah, I just got lucky. Hey, Megan, when I get back, I'm gonna take that job as a a bagger at the store. - Are you serious? - Yeah, my inventing days are behind me. - All right, we can talk about it when you get back, okay? - I love you. - Tell Meara I love her and I love you. (soft music) (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (hit thuds) (Larry grunts) - Oh my god. Oh, no. Are you okay? (Theo and Meara laughing) (upbeat music) (Larry yelling) (upbeat music) (Larry yells) - I want to thank both of you for giving Meara the best spring break of her life. - Oh, are you kidding? Thank you. Santiago and I had a blast and Theo is laughing again. Having you and Meara with us was amazerrific. - So nice of you. The truth is... I'm just an unsuccessful inventor who was trying to show his daughter a good time on spring break. And I was failing miserably at it until you ran over me. - Oh. (hit thuds) (Larry yells) - Sorry. It was my pleasure. - Now I feel terrible. - Why? - Why? - I'm sorry, but I have to give you this - What? - You are suing us. See, I knew it. I knew it. - I can't believe you'd do this to us. - Listen. "I, Larry Buble, like Michael Buble..." (laughs) (Santiago sighs) "Promise never to sue my dear friends Santiago and Fernanda Arechavaleta." - La-la-la... (Larry mumbles gibberish) Friends don't sue friends. - [Fernanda] Oh. - Te como la cara! (kiss smacks) Ah! (Larry yells) No! - Oh, I'm sorry! (Larry yells) (upbeat music) - Thank you. I got her. - Okay. - All right. - We got you the same room we had at The Villa. - Here is the key. - Oh. Thank you. - See you tomorrow at the airport. - Thank you for everything. (soft music) (birds chirping) - Dad? Do you think the publisher lady is gonna like my drawings? - Oh, she's gonna love them. - Dad? - Yeah? - Did you mean what you said last night? - What was that? - That you're gonna take that job as a bagger. - That's a good job, baby. - But it's not your dream. Inventing is your dream. - Sometimes when you have a dream, you wake up. Besides, you and your mom are the best dream I could ever have, anyway. Now come on. Let's do this. Let's go. Come on. - [Bird] Good bye. - Bye! - Bye. (upbeat music) Best spring break ever. - I had an awesome time. (upbeat music) - We're doing it. (Larry laughs) - I can't wait to see Theo. - Woo! - This little girl is so talented. I promise, you won't be disappointed. (soft upbeat music) - You ready? - Yeah. (Larry laughs) - We are doin' it. We're doin' it. (car sputtering) What? No, no, no. No. No, no, no, no, no. - What's the matter?

I'm eight! - You can steer, like you did before. - Santiago, are your friends coming or not? I have a meeting in New York I can't mis - Let's straighten it out, honey. You're doin' great, we're gonna make it! We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it. Just keep going straight. You're doin' good, I love you.

Once upon a time, there was a princess who didn't appreciate Jack Squat. - Jack who? - Jack Squat, the frog. You see Jack Squat was a frog who worked for a princess that never said thank you. - [Meara] Not even once? - [Larry] Not even once. Jack Squat did everything for the young princess. He cut up her food, he put it in her mouth. Jack Squat brushed her hair and her teet with the same brush, of course. - Ew, gross, why didn't he use a toothbrush? - That's a question for Jack Squat. One day after Jack helped the princess chew her food and blink her eyeballs, Jack waited for a thank you, but it never came. So Jack said to himself, "This princess doesn't appreciate Jack Squat." So Jack Squat went back to his pond. One day, he found a pink hair ribbon that belonged to a beautiful princess. When Jack returned the ribbon, the princess kissed Jack on the cheek to say thank you. And with that kiss, Jack turned into a handsome young prince and the two were married. At the wedding, the princess who never said thank you came by, but she wasn't able to eat any of the wedding cake because she didn't have anybody to help her chew it. - [Meara] Did the princess realize that the handsome prince was Jack? - Nope. The princess didn't recognize the handsome prince because she didn't appreciate Jack Squat (upbeat orchestral music) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music swells) - [Jack] Brilliant!
