We call this the High Lonesome Country, because, neighbor, it is high and it is lonesome. See that speck out there in the middle? That's the Horace Davis ranch headquarters where we live. It took us years of work and war and trouble to get this cow range whipped. And we thought we had it done. Then one night a strange thing happened that we didn't know how to explain. We saw no harm in it then. But a long time afterward, we knew the greatest danger of our lives came on us as the sun went down. Nothing come this way or them quail would have flown before now. Must be lower down. Give me my rifle. What's the matter? Something's spooking the horses. Oh, that ain't nothing but that cooncat fixing to raid my cook shack again. All right, we'll get us a cooncat. Awful lot of prowling around out there, seems to me. Yeah, that Boatwhistle's trying to get that cooncat. You'll hear the old fool's shotgun in a minute. A cooncat wouldn't set foot in that kitchen. Coon cats are too clean. [SHOT GUN BLAST] There he goes. [SHOT GUN BLAST.] He's got a 45. Oh, now honestly. What a bunch of knotheads. We get worse around here everyday. Better let the boys handle it, Abby. Who, them? What was your theory, shooting out that window? What was your theory shooting that shadow. Thought I seen something. Me too. Hey, that durn cooncat's learned how to light a lamp. You better get your hands up. Oh, I'm gonna. What you got, Dixie? Come on in. Watch out whose head you're shooting off, too. A fine cooncat. Who are you, Billy the Kidd? Nobody you ever heard of. On your way to California, huh? I been working at Marfa. Who for, sonny? Sawmill. No sawmill in Marfa. [POTS CLANGING] - Dandy, huh? - I ought to. Hold it, Frank. What do we seem to have caught? We call it a cooncat. Leave off will you fellas? Better come with me, coon cat. See how things look from the house. Bring the lamp closer, Meagan. This is healing all right. Is it bad? It's been bad. No wonder. Popping out of the ground that way. Must have come under a rock. He can look where he's popping. Smart, ain't you? What's the matter with him? You know what I think? This boy's killed somebody. We'll find out who in the morning. I won't be around. Meagan, Cut one more hunk of that poor excuse for bread. Put them in the table drawer, Abby. Might need something from it. I think you're right. Give him the bread, Meagan. Now go over by the door. Give a good paw on that bell roll. Sit down. [BELL CLANGING] You can't hold me here. We can sure try. Draw back a bit, son. Abby don't want to hurt you. Not on her clean floor. What's the matter? Where's those little handcuffs from the time I was deputy? Well, I saw them the other day around here somewhere. Well, dig them up. Lock this critter to a bunk. Tomorrow's Sunday but I'll back trail them right after Bibles. We'll hang on to him. Come on, you. Come on the man said. I heard him. Abby? Is that coffee still hot? Should be, Pa. Well, I've got them so they'll go on. I don't know if they'll ever come off or not. That's all right. They'll look good on him. Hey, watch out for that lamp. Put them on him. Put them on him. Settle down boy. And why take ye thought of raiment. Consider the lilies of the fields. (YELLING) Hey, Abby. Where are you? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. (YELLING) Hey. Consider how that fathead bellers. Well, it's only Pat Farrell. That's what I say. (YELLING) Abigail. Hey, Abby. I brought you... Where's the body? You know, Pa always reads the Bible on Sunday. Sunday? It is? OK. I can't stop now. See you, Abby. I'll be back for dinner. Come back here. Say, I had a horse thief the other night. Run him off before I got anything. Is that your horse thief? Him? Nah. A great big Indian, I think. Then shut up and sit down. So dark I couldn't even see my gun sights. Shut up. Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin, Yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is... Don't you try it. Oh, no you don't. [CRASHING SOUNDS] Sure you don't know him, Pat? Why do you think your horse thief was an Indian if it was so dark? Hey. If he stood there, he might look like a tall Indian. I was never near your ponies. Oh, you weren't? That's my lariat he's got there. What'd you take that for? I had to get me a horse the same way everything's taken from me. That's what I took it for. If he's so desperate to steal a horse it's because he done something worse. Boatwhistle, fetch my team. Back trailing's going to be rough if he's been through them rocks. I got a better idea. Hold this. I ain't going to wait on you hand and foot. Did you ever see anything so dead set to go free? Just one steady basic series of wild jumps. He'll try just once more. Hey, there goes your once. Sure, why did you think I gave him the rope for? Hey Dixie. Yeah. Things will probably get kind of rough with that kid. Well, we'll see about it. You better not lose any time. You ready to talk? I ain't ready for nothing. Kid, you need to give up. How's that? Think it'll do you? No. I'll kill you if I have to. Well, come on, wake up. Let's get on with it. [MOANING] Sure, I know you're ready for more. There's no end to it. No. I give in. Well, it's about time. So, this is your better idea, huh? Yes, and it worked. So, shut up and listen. You'll find it out, no matter what I do. Find what? There's a corpse at wagon road I killed Jim Shell. Where's the body? (TEARILY) On the floor of the trading post. There you are. [GUN SHOTS] This the place? Yes, sir. It's funny how haunted and deathly that thing can look you know what's inside. Where'd you bed down? Over there. Beside them old busted walls. Planned the robbery there, huh? It was my own money. Yeah, what was Jim Shell doing with it? Well this road. Has a bad name. Said he better keep it for me until morning. Good idea. No, sir. After a while them two strangers moved in on me and ate up my grub. So I thought I better make a night march and get rid of them. But this trader, this Jim Shell, he, he wouldn't give me my money back. He said, well, he never heard of no money. Two strangers come stood in the door and heard it all. So you shot the trader. Not right then. I come back out to my fire there on the ruin. Those strangers followed me. That foreign talking one, he kept pawing through my stuff. And the other one, the one that kept smiling. He come and stood over me. Why don't you stuck a gun in his belly? You got a right to your own. I got no gun. We'll loan you a gun. I wouldn't want to shoot him. Who said shoot him? You just going in, you hold a gun on him. Say, I want my money. We'll back you up. Sure we'll be there. Get that gun out of the pack, Roper. You know the one I mean. Hey, wait a minute. You want your money, don't you? It sounded like an order. So I took the gun they gave me and went back inside the trading post. Jim Shell was over by the fireplace, fixing a pack sack. You, again, huh? You got it, you know you got it. Them two foragers give you that? I've got to have my money. Not men enough to try it themselves. Just sent a boy ahead, huh? I gotta have it. Are you sure that gun's loaded? Stay back or you'll find out. [GUN SHOT] I didn't know where I was at first when I come to. I thought I was blind. But pretty soon I could see. Then I remembered. And I knew I'd killed a man. I didn't know where them two strangers wanted to do about it. Couldn't think. All I knew was I better run. It's a good thing I did run. I thought you said the kid was dead. Get the horses. I left but they tracked me a long way. That's where I got so hungry. I wonder why'd they do that? They'd be blamed, wouldn't they? Unless they could show I done it. Those two strangers are as guilty as the boy. They planned the robbery. Used the boy because he was handy. They got to be tracked down. I'll string a net across this range a flea couldn't get through. I'll rouse up every rancher for ninety miles around. They're probably a long ways further off than 90 miles. That's what we got to make sure of. Take a look at the ruin, Frank. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, come here, boy. You see him? Dead? Look for yourself. Dust. Inches deep. Everywhere. But there has... Maybe there was a dust storm. Hasn't been any. Why the place has been deserted for months. I'll tell you something else. Hasn't been any fire inside of that ruin. No ashes. No tracks. Nobody's been near it. I can even show you the place where the fireplace was, where I leaned and had to move. You know something, I think the boy believes it. Don't you know why? Why, this kid's crazy. He's no more in his right mind than a hydrophic skunk. Yeah. Makes it tough to know what to do with him. Do you believe I'm out of my mind? I don't know. I could throw him off on the sheriff at Marfa. No. Not until I know what he's done. All right. Look I'll give him a horse, some kind of a horse. We'll, we'll give him a head start and run the heck out of him. I not going to do that either. Why? Because we need him to finally get to the bottom of this thing. You can't just keep him around. Who can't? You can't. With the girls there. I've got something to say about that. I don't think you have. Why you. You cantankerous old mosshorn. You can't tell what a kid like this is liable to do. Hey, did you find it? Find what? That there dead feller that was killed. Ain't any. Trading posts been locked up for months. Why would the boy say he killed somebody if he... Well, how should I know? You'll have a chance to find out though. Your old man's taking him in to live with you. Oh, he must be fooling. Well, he ain't. I hollered against it, but he sunk his teeth into me. We went round and round. Oh, Pat, have you been fighting with Pa again, I... Well, did you find out anything? Did you talk to anyone? We didn't find out nothing about nothing. I'm the only one to take care you. Look at your menfolks. Two old cripples and a couple of tramps. We still got guns. [CHUCKLING] Who to shoot them? See that nail holding that dishpan? [GUN SHOT] Maybe that answers your question. Why you... Well. Oh, I can't hit you, honey. Oh, I can hit you. That's the trouble. No time to leave go. All right. I'll leave go if you will. Pa said all along you were nothing but a loud yell with hands. Hey, you want me to call off the barn, woman? You want your barn warm, don't you? I didn't put on a new roof just to set and admire it by myself. Oh, I'm going through with it, and so are you. Now ask me who we've got to handle a shot gun. Come on, honey. I want to show you something. Bread and butter. Bread and butter. Well, I see we're still going to the party. See Big Jim here. There's been a Big Jim in our family for a long time. My grandpappy rode from Kentucky on the first Big Jim. Yes you told me 20 times. This horse here's the only living stud of the Big Jim line. If he should stumble I'd go lame. Hasn't been hit on the head lately, has he? Pat, you're leaving your horse. That ain't my horse. What? I know it sounds ridiculous. After we're married it won't matter who's he be. I just wanted you to have the one finest thing in the world. That there's the finest, I guess every man thinks his horse is the best. It's probably right. But that's the best horse right there. Did you write your mother? Sure did. Well, I'm going to keep him here for awhile. Boy. You're going to do odd jobs around the place on foot. Keep off the ponies. I'll let you have the run of the place for now. He's been dragged. Yes, and he'll be dragged again every time he breaks. You go help your sister. I never heard such a lie. This creepy kid... You don't know half how creepy he is. Boatwhistle, I want you to hear something. Boy, tell him what those two men looked like you saw at the wagon road. Give him the smiling man. Well, he was sort of black looking. And guarded. And he had a cast in his eyes so you couldn't tell which eye was pointing where. And a smile on his face like he was seeing you dead. Sort of a slight smile. Great land of fury. Now give him the other, the one the smiling man called Roper. Roper? Well, he was sort of short and thick set, foreign way of talking. Well, sir, in all my life I ain't never heard nothing like that. You recognize them? Why, how could he be mistook? Sniding smile. He's got them both perfect. Now we're getting somewhere. Nah, he never saw them at the wagon loan or any other place on this earth. Well, why didn't he see them? Tell them, Boatwhistle. Because both them men are dead. They died fighting Horse and me at the fence more than 15 years ago. I keep thinking I see something. Abby, Why don't you and Pat live here after you're married. Don't you feel kind of funny going over to the old Jessup place? It isn't the Jessup place any more. It's Pat's and my place. Why should I feel funny? Oh, that's what makes you so jumpy maybe. Everything over there belongs to the Jessups who are dead. Graveyard's right in back of the house. Everybody in it died at the Fence War fighting us. And hating us. [HORSES WHINNYING] Well, I admit I... Listen there is something wrong. Hey, get a gun, will you? Come on. What's the matter? There are two strangers up there watching the house. Where? See them from over by the storage tank. Come on, I'll show you. [MOANING] They're right over there. Well, they was there. Big Jim saw them. He whinnied. Yeah, we saw them. Two riders without no heads. They was awful, wasn't they, Frank? I was sure scared. Won't you never believe nothing I say? No, sir. And I'm getting sick and tired of this spook business. So you get that bucket of water and bring it on in the house. Well, forget about it. Let's think about the barn warming. And there'll be my wedding. It's the strangest thing. It's gone now. For a minute there I never felt more danger in my life. I'll blow out the lamp and come to bed. (SINGING) Get low, get low, low lordy. Take the train, the wagon road train gotta a pretty little gal in Carson and I'm twenty miles from Carson in the rain. Stand still, will you. You want to look pretty for the barn warming, don't you? Oh, I ain't needed there. Well, no one's aiming to stay here with you that for sure. Turn around. Hey, son. Where'd you get these boots? Rancher give them to me. Ah, hah. Boatwhistle. Huh? Where'd Pa go? Just wasting horseflesh. Tracking down them spooks. Old fool ain't going to catch nothing. He's blinder than a bat in a barrel. What spooks? Cooncat seen them. Sitting out there in the dead of night without any heads. Was you said no heads. Abby. There's something hanging on this kid's shirttail like grim death to a tax lien. And do you think he'll switch from his one same lie. They ain't after me. They would have rode out long ago. Those fellows want to hurt you people here. What fellows? I don't know who your enemies be, Mister. But boy, you got them. Why don't they drop a bullet through one of these windows and be done with it. Oh, they'd never get out of this basin if so much as Meagan got away. Every rancher within 90 miles would be on them. Horse Davis said so himself. All right. Take that off. Come on, Boatwhistle. Show me the tracks. All right. If you got to. But any answer to this is standing right here on this breezeway. Now, honey, if you haven't seen a back before... Who did that to you? You wouldn't believe nothing I said anyway. Your old man, huh? Well, he kept piling it on me until I run off. What was he beating you about? Well, he was full of liquor, mostly. I suppose you robbed him, seeing as you was leaving. Sure. Took seven dollars for the seven years I worked there. What in heaven's name did he hit you with? Trace chain. Nobody uses a trace chain here. Only a drag rope, huh? Not anymore. I can promise you that. Meagan, give him a hat. Hold these. Wait a minute. Let's see which... Here, try that blue one on him. No, no. That ain't much good. Here, Let me see now. Wait, now. There's one. That ought to look pretty good on him. No. That makes him look too dudish. You're going to have to cut that ribbon off. That's no good. Here. We'll get rid of that. Here. Try it. Now, that ought to be all right. Try this one. But that's... Hush. Listen, this isn't a girl's hat. It's my hat. I have another. Let's go, Boatwhistle. Hey, sonny. Hat's for town. [MOOING] Bringing in some wood. Bringing it in from our room, huh? No, ma'am. It's outside. I was just beginning to hope. Rush of tallow to the head, I guess. I was only trying... You were in our room. Don't lie to me. Have it your own way. You ever set foot in this house again without being told, I'll have you horsewhipped. Now get out. Meagan. Yeah. For heaven's sakes. Come in here. What's the matter? Cooncat? Oh, honestly. What a dead fall. Why? Well, I just gave him both barrels for being in here. Everybody's always giving both barrels around here. Well... Trouble is our home. We've been beat over the head with gun wars and dry outs and burn outs and blizzards and every other ding dang thing that wasn't useful. Are we going to let a dopey kid throw us? Well, it's not that I'm thrown. It's... Saturday night at the barn warming. After that party and two more, I will have been to three. I don't want to hear another ding dang thing about cooncat trouble or any other kind. I'm going to a party. Yes, ma'am. Oh, I'll be right along behind you. You all getting in shape? You two sprouts get in this wagon. We're going to take off to that party on the high low. Hurry up. Now, come on. Get in here. Help me up, cooncat. Come on. Get in there. You ready? Yes. Boatwhistle, you didn't shave. I did so shave. Feel your face. I won't do it. I shaved. [LAUGHTER] Oh, great land of fury. Get up out of here. You see them old stone logs over there? Listen, sonny. I been on this ranch for twenty years. And if there's something afouling that, I'd have knowed it. Then you know it. Those are the walls of our first house. The one that was burned during the fence war. There should be a row of hollyhocks along here. Why, I see them little specks of dust. That ain't nothing but range horses. Sure. Range horses. Running loose with people on them. I got something I want to show you up the road apiece. You'll be interested. Get on now. Get. This here's the line of the famous death fence. Like you know all about. I know what I heard from you. And a whole lot more. In a minute I'm going to prove that you do. But maybe there's one thing that you don't know. You see all them bones here? Yes, sir. That's what's left of a great herd. Horse Davis's herd. You know how them cattle died? No. Well, every few years, we get a blizzard from the north that drives our cattle before it. They always took shelter up in them canyons up ahead until our feud with the Jessup family begun. Nobody knows how it started. Oh, some little thing. But one thing led to another. And Miles Jessup built this fence here. That year, the blizzard come. And our cattle piled up on this fence a hundred, deep as far as the eye could see. Them that didn't die, well you see them now, had their hoofs froze off. Walked around on the stumps until they fell down. I've heard this story a hundred times. So, now you know what your Miles Jessup done that we have to fight him. And the fight was never finished while there was a Jessup left. Then Miles Jessup hung dying on his own fence. Right over there by that post. Hey, look up there. Well, look, will you? No, I won't look. I'm getting sick and tired of you hollering, look. Boatwhistle, you've got to. They're there. Huh. You, too, now, huh? [CHUCKLING] Yeah. It's funny. But it's a mean kind of funny if you're in my place. Anyway cooncat. I saw them. Now do you see what I'm up against? Yes. I do see. Hm, hm. You're trying to change the subject, ain't you? Caught you knowing a little bit too much, didn't I? You kind of give the whole thing away. Give what away? Miles Jessup that died right here. You described him to me to the last hair when you spoke of the smiling man. The smiling man and Miles Jessup are one and the same. I only told you who I saw. And the Roper. That was a nickname of a Cajun fellow. Thick set foreign talking man, just like you said. Boatwhistle shot him in the throat. Pa said he bled like a flash flood. His brother came over and grabbed him up arms, trying to close his throat with his hands until he died. Right over there by that mesquite. And them's the men you say you remember? Sonny, they was dead when you were two years old. I said I saw them because I did. Am I supposed to think that dead men walk? No, dead men don't walk. You were speaking of men you heard tell of so much that you even knew their faces and the way they talked. Now, what I want to know is, who filled that in to you? Nobody did. Great land of fury. I give up. Come on. Get in the buckboard. We're going to the party. [CROWD PARY NOISE] You know something, Horse? What's that, Boatwhistle? There's people here tonight from all over the world and part of Arkansas. [CROWD NOISE] [KNOCK, KNOCK] Hey, Abby. Yes? You all right? [KNOCK] Abby, come on. I'm coming. Where's Abby? Did she go to sleep in the... Well, who's this? Why, you've seen me in a skirt before. Well, I guess I can get used to it. Oh, Pat. I get so tired of trying to be a man. That's all over with. From now on, you're going to wear dresses every day. And I'll love it. Pat, where are your father and mother? I haven't seen them. Well, they ain't here yet. Then you didn't send them word. Oh, sure I did. You gave them the wrong day. I even sent a boy this morning to fetch them. Don't forget it's a half day's ride by the wagon road. Seems awfully funny. Oh, come on. They'll be here. Let's have some fun. [CROWD NOICE] Hey, come on everybody. You've eaten the barbecue. Let's dance. [SQUARE DANCE MUSIC] All join in. Circle of eight. Break a trail along that line and get behind.

Bow to your partner. Your corner call. Wave to the pretty girl across the hall. Now two. Couples Wasn't there one Jessup left alive? A young one? Bob Jessup? He was thirteen. I knew it.

[SQUARE DANCE MUSIC] The old cow kicked and the fellow called. Swing the opposite across the hall. Same two gents forward and back. Cooncat. I want to tell you something. I love your flowers. That's the nicest thing anyone ever did. I don't know what you mean. All right. But I'll tell you something else. Those were the first flowers we ever got in all our lives. [SQUARE DANCE MUSIC] Turn your back and spit on the wall and swing the opposite across the hall. Forward and back. Forward and back. Forward again and circle toward. Two little ladies dosey doe. Little bit of heel and a little bit of toe. Now take your honey and home you go. That's going to be the last, boys. Ain't going to be no more because that is all. [APPLAUSE] Come Boatwhistle. Play 20 Miles of Darkness. [APPLAUSE] It just so happens that I got my guitar right back here. [CLAPPING] I wrote this myself. What key we going to do it, Larry? (SINGING)So, get along, get along Old Baldy. Take the trail the wagon road train. Gotta a pretty little gal in Carson and I'm 20 miles from Carson in the rain. Now Jack don't go back to Carson. I'm afraid you've lost your play. 20 cowboys. Isn't it nice just to meet people? I never knew no people like you before. Well, you You know us now. (SINGING) So get along get along Old Baldy. Turn around there. Take me over the funeral range. Because a poor cowpoke's heart is breaking 20 miles from Carson in the rain. Now Jack don't go back to Carson. That gal'll never keep that date. There's a million men in all passed through Carson since the fall. I'd say you got back too late. So get along, get along old Baldy. Turn around. Where's your Pa? In the house, I guess. Wait here. Cooncat, where you going? Stay in the light no matter what. [CRASH, GLASS BREAKING] Cooncat. Meagan, go back. (WHISPERING) The girl will scream her head off. Not for long. Wait a minute. Right over there. Look past my shoulder by that farm wagon. You see them now? No. Those spooks really get around don't they? I was looking for your Pa to tell him they was here. Oh, Cooncat. What are we going to do with you? With me? Why you people can't even take care of yourselves. Those fellows aren't after me, I'm only in their way. Then why are you running? I can help you people because you won't believe me. And I ain't staying around to get blamed. You leave that be. You're not fit to go running around loose. You'll get yourself hurt feeling this way. That's my business. And I'm making it mine. Now get yourself inside unless you want 20 Ropers on your heels. Come on, I said. [PARTY CROWD NOISE] What happened to Art? I don't know, Rudolph. He come riding in here a while ago, just as fast as he could. [INTERPOSING CONCERNED VOICES] Uh, huh. Somebody found out something. What's that to us? I'll find out. Wait at the horses. [INTERPOSING CONCERNED VOICES] Where was my mom? Found her in the kitchen. Like she had just used that stove when it come. Your father was out in the corral. Looked like he got it as he rode in. How long the been dead? Maybe a week. [KNOCK, KNOCK] Pat, dear, I'm so sorry. So now we know what it was the boy done. Those sweet old people. [KNOCK, KNOCK] You want Meagan? Let her come in. When was you over on the War Paint River? I was never on the War Paint River. The dry creek near the wagon road. Don't you remember a shack and a few sheds? Just a half a day's travel to the east? I must have passed a dozen places like that. That's enough. The boy has the right to speak. All right. Why don't you tell the people to go home. All right. Pass the word as quietly as you can. I want you girls to go home, too. I think you better take them. What are you going to do? I'm going to hang him. I can't let you do it, Pat. What? First, I need to know how this boy can describe two men he never saw. But they was here. Tonight. We was face to face. You can tell them. You saw them. You had to see them. He told me he saw them. My Pa took a bullet through his lung standing by you. Have you forgotten that? He was the only man outside of your hired hands who stood with you at the death fence. Yeah, that's true. But the fact still stands that we know nothing whatever about this boy. He was so afraid to show his face, he risked your guns rather than ask for grub. Frantic for a horse. Frantic to get out of the country. I know that. Remember what you said. There's been a crime. A bad one. We got to find out what was. I said that. You caught him a week ago tonight. It was a week ago my folks was killed. About a half days ride away. We found out everything you've been asking and you know it. I don't even know the boy was there. You never will if you hold out for an eyewitness. Two people saw him. And they're dead. Horse. Cooncat was there. I never thought for a minute that that boy done one thing that was wrong. But it was me that fixed his boots. Where'd you get those boots? A rancher give them to me. Pull them off. Brad F. My Pa's brand. Then it was him give them to me. Sonny. What'd you pull the stitches out for? Oh, I knew people'd say I stole them. I been wearing castoffs... [GRUNT] Are you satisfied? I am not. And I won't be until I know a lot more than I know now. All I've got to know is who killed my ma and pa. And I know. Well, I don't. Mr. Davis, I swear to you, he'll never leave this place. He will if I do. Pat, he's right. Are you standing with him or with me? I'm standing with myself. If you leave with that insane killer not one of you or any critter of your brand will ever set foot on this place again. Oh, Pat, I don't believe you. And you can have the fence back Right where it was. And quick. Walk out that door. Abby. Get in the buggy. We'll lead your horse. I have no horse. [DOOR SLAMS] -Get that wagon up here. Get that in here. Keep an eye out. Pat, Pat. I never believed he'd do it. I believed it. It's going to be the same terrible thing all over again. No. You know why? That gully over there is where Tommy died. 11 years old. Told him to stay home, of course, but he fell there with his kilt pony. I know. We won our fight. It didn't matter anymore. I'll never go to the guns again. Well, I can be in Marfa by midnight. I'll telegraph from there and get the fire from Wichita. And they'll work from Kansas City. They've got to meet my drive in Dodge. Meet what in Dodge? Every cow we got that can walk them. Fill out the cattle. Oh, you old fool. You ain't going to get through in the teeth of winter. I'll loose every critter I got if I hold them here. And you'll get to Dodge all right with about one cow left and she'll be a skull on a stick. If the rest of the herd's as good as this one, we'll get through. Oh, Pa, you're away everything we got in the world for a wretched boy who doesn't even want it. I'm not doing it for the boy. Either a thing is right or it's wrong. There's no half way. Pa, why don't take Meagan into Marfa with you? Be ready in seven seconds? I sure can. All right. I'll send down 12, 14 trail hands fast as I can find them and you can start them rounding up. Oh, this is going to be the end of this brand. You know that, don't you? I want every critter I own bunched and ready to start when I get back. If only Tommy was alive. That's when they broke this outfit's back. When they killed that little kid. Pa didn't say we were beat. No, he did't say it. But I know as well I know anything in the world that fence would have come out whistling if your brother was alive today. Well, he ain't. Now get going. Get up out of here. Hyah. [MOOING] I don't know. Mr. Davis sent them to Marfa. Put your stuff in the bunkhouse and grab a sack. You know what your pappy would say to this? He'd say, it's too bad she's here instead of Tommy. Now, lead out the wagons. You know something? I ain't about to. I'll go if you'll let me. I can cook all right. Then stay here with this loony kid. Take that carbon off my saddle. You think I'm Calamity Jane? Well, now it seems like that you think that you are. Abby, Pat Farrell has brought on just as many cowboys as we got here. Only his is Russ and Romo and they ain't like these cowpokes. You're on the chuckwagon, Dixie. Don't you do it Dixie. You ought to know whose ramrodding this outfit by now. He knows. Eh. Pull out the team, Dixie. Abby. Abby, honey, why don't you just listen to me? Come on boys, let's go. Abby, you don't know what you're doing. We're going to tear down that fence. Hup. Get up. Great land of fury. Hah. Get on up. Burn them all boys. I don't want a post left standing. We'll do it, Abby. Sure don't like this smoke we're making. It's bound to be seen. Afraid it has been seen. Right above that knot. Yes, I see them. Holy cow. We're going down there. Don't shoot until they do. We'll have to pull out. We can't do any more here. [WHISTLE] They can't hear that. Well, fire a shot, quick. Ain't you afraid they'll think that... Give me that. [GUN SHOTS] Oh, those fools. Take this. Abby. Hold your fire. It's Abby. Abby, Abby. Abby. [HORSE SCREAMING] I hate empty saddles. It's the old fence war all over again. Hey, look. That's Abby's pony. Ain't no blood no place. Yeah, here's some. I can't stay here no more. Get the buckboard out and fetch me out that box of cartridges. We're going out there. Let him go. What did you let him go for? I learned one great thing at that barn party. That kid's my lucky charm. I'm not so sure. They blame him for everything. They don't even believe their own eyes when he tells them what they see. I'll be sorry when they hang him. I don't like it. He'll bring Boatwhistle now. Go to the horses. Have them ready when you hear my gun. Where's them cartridges? Go get them cartridges. Go on. Just tell me one thing. Couldn't Miles Jessup be alive? How could he be alive? Maybe you only wounded him. He was buried by our own boys. Maybe you buried the wrong one. Or maybe he come to and busted himself out of the ground. Oh great land of fury. I'll go get them cartridges myself. (SCREAMING) I am begging you. Please don't go in there. Please, Boatwhistle. Please don't go in there. Oh, sonny, no one is going to say you're crazy. Hello, Boatwhistle. Miles. Haven't forgotten, I see. Miles Jessup. What's the matter Boatwhistle? Didn't you never expect to see a Jessup again? Not this side of the grave. I remember what fun you had putting us there. No, Miles, it was always... [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOTS] More? Not now. Pat tried to stop the fire when he saw you. He was coming to you when his horse was killed. The stud horse? Yeah. You could hear the horse scream for a mile. Pat had to put a bullet in his head. Oh, Jim. I want all hands saddled at half past four. Can you throw them breakfast at quarter of? I don't know nothing about bread, Mr. Davis. Give them hard tack. By daylight, I want the wagon road closed both ways. And the way into Marfa. And all trails stopped off. That way I'll have a chance to head off that boy. Yes, sir. Swelling? Beats quite a bit. This is all my fault. Boatwhistle lies dead out there because I couldn't see what was plain and clear. What's plain and clear? That boy's a Jessup. There's no doubt in the world. I don't believe it. Who was killed first? The Farrells. Then Boatwhistle. Both with me all through the trouble. But that doesn't explain... That boy has even memorized the faces of the men that were killed. Tries to make us think we were haunted. There's your giveaway. Cooncat wasn't even armed. Where's the house gun? Now go to your room. I have all the contention I can stomach without a lot of sass spread on it. Someone had to go to Pat Farrell. He's got to be told I was wrong. Afraid to tell him yourself? This break between you and Pat was all my fault. The fence fight and all. I'll stand by what I did. Abby. There's no more reason for fighting now. Men don't fight about a reason. They fight about they got in a fight. Pat won't. Thanks, Pa. Please be quiet. Come here. It was the smiling man killed Boatwhistle. Right before my eyes. Cooncat, I believe you but nobody else will. If only you hadn't come back here. Oh, it's never any different. But I had to tell you. If only you hadn't told that whopper about the wagon road. Oh, I wished a million times I'd never spoke. Even took Pa out there and swore he'd find a body. Yeah, I don't know now why it wasn't there. You still claim there was one? Course there was. I know what happened to it. What could have happened... That's what I came back to tell you. There's no other hope of waking you people up. Talking to somebody in there, Meagan? I'm making a star count. 792, 793, Well, count by fifties, like cattle. Get to bed. All right. Quick. Tell me. Them strangers. The smiling man and the Roper. They hid the body. They shoveled dust in there and brushed out their tracks. Why would they do that if you killed him? Oh, I've never done it, Meagan. I know that now. They fired across me after I was knocked out. That's why they covered it up. They wouldn't bother. They'd just ride on in a hurry. They bothered because they weren't ready to ride on. They came here to do something. They covered it up so they could stay and get it done. Oh, if we could only prove it. A corpse will prove it. Even if everything's like you say, we couldn't find the body. They could've buried him anyplace in about hundred miles. Or they could've buried him right there. Maybe he's been there all this time. I gotta go there and bust in. I figure only got until morning. A much better bet for you is just to ride until your horse drops. Well, if I don't find anything, then I will go on. I've got to stop and try this one more thing. I'm coming with you. Oh, no you're not. I only told you so you'd know what to expect. Cooncat. You've got to go back. Your father will follow. He'll follow me anyway. I left a message telling where we went. Great guns, Meagan. What did you do that for? I'll never have time to find anything now. Course you will if we get started. Ain't there no way to get rid of you? No. Can't you see you'll need me when he gets here. I'll help you all I can. Come on. No, sir. You ain't going. Oh, yes, I am. Oh, no you ain't. You want to bet? Yeah, anything. You're not going and that's final. Show me the end of your rope. Here. Keep your eyes peeled now. Think he'll pull? Course he will. All right take it away. Cooncat? Are you all right? What are you doing? On the way up. All this dust. How would they get it spread all over? How do I know? Maybe they threw it in with a shovel. Does look kinda funny. There's rocks in it. See that dark stain? That's his blood. Then it is all true. Course it's true. Got to find him. I've got to. If I could tear down this whole place. Cooncat. Hush a minute. I thought I heard horses. But I guess I didn't though. It's awful quiet. [HOWLING] It's almost morning. I can see a little streak of mustard in the east. That's what those brush wolves are singing at. Oh, there's no use going on, there's nothing here. But won't the bloodstain prove... Oh, they'd say he spilled something. Well, what are we going to do? I guess I gotta run. I was hoping too hard, I guess. I was sure it was here but it ain't. No, it ain't here. It's in the canyon under a ton of cave downed dirt. Someday a flash flood will wash up a skull about 20 miles downstream. But not soon. Go, Meagan. [GUN SHOT] Stick close to me. They'll be right on us. They got into the brush. Get after them. You hurt? Ah. Smiling man's got our horses. Where are they now? Looking inside the ruins. We'll go in there as soon as he's gone. Why? It's the only safe place. He's looked in there already. Start now. I wish Pa would come. They're sure to find us. No, they won't. (TEARFULLY) We're going to be here forever? Maybe quite a while. We'll just figure we live here I guess. That wouldn't be so bad. What wouldn't? Living here. I could fix it up real pretty. If it had walls. Floor. I could fix that. I could do it with my own hands. Could I have new windows? Sure, I know how to do things like that. I know how to cook and hook rugs and everything. Well, I don't want to think about it now. Why? Nothing good can happen. I'm a murderer everybody thinks. I don't. I know. I, I just keep thinking if only things were different. But they are different. They stood right there and said he did it. He killed Jim Shell and you're in the clear. Oh, if Pa had only come. He's got to come. He's never let anybody down in his whole life. [BANGING] They're back. Smiling man anyway. I thought I heard wheels. Don't hear them now. There's Roper. Where you going? Look inside. Keep back. I was in there. Come on. Horse Davis come all right. He's only a little way out. Alone? Two men with him. Pat Farrell's coming up. Take the horses around behind. Everything's going to be all right. Yeah, everything's going to be all right. There they are. Come here. Hold your fire. Let them come, you fool. Easy shot. I've waited for this many years. If you shoot before I tell you, I'll kill you in the same half second. Hey. Hey. I got your word. I sent no word for you to come here. Abby thought you might need me. Well, I don't. And they'll hold their fire until nobody can miss. Gotta let him know. That's no good. Pa'd think you were signalling. Not if I put it close enough to his ear. [GUN SHOT] That's that kid from the ruins. Nah, the echo fooled you. It's from the ridge. When he's tired of that, he'll come on again. Dixie, Frank, do a couple of shots down there to hold his interest. I'm going around the long way by the canyon. [GUN SHOTS] Ah, they just lie up there and plug bullets into them old adobe walls. Do you think they sent... Meagan, look. [GUN SHOT] He thinks I'm in there. Only this one gun. Maybe even thinks I won't kill him. No. I've got to warn him. He'll answer and they'll kill him. It'll happen any second. [GUN SHOT] I've gotta go out there. At least make him know. Cooncat. Stay back. That's Cooncat. He ain't inside. There's another gunman in there. Keep shooting. That's all we can do. It ain't all I can do. You can't get to him. I can't lay here and see the old man get dry gulched. [GUN SHOTS] Kill the man that turns. Drop your guns. Now get up. Slow. Face the wall. Now go easy to the door. Don't go out. He's setting us up for the guns on the ridge. Yeah. I thought you'd remember me. [GUN SHOT] They told me Bob Jessup was in the pen. That's right. Or I'd have been here long ago. Him I recognize. I saw his brother die in his arms. Defense. But you. You must have been about 13 then. You remember me. I knew your father. This is like as if Miles Jessup walked from the grave. Yeah, exactly. [GUN SHOT] Help the boy. I'm helping him. Handle him easy. Yeah. He can have anything I got in the world. You better pray he can use it. You came here to kill him. And he gave you your life on a plate. From now on, he'll never be without friends. Or without a home.
