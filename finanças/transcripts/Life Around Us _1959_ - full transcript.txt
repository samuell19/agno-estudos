They are a public menace. A danger for society. The full weight of the law must fall onto those who intend to mock it. We must defend our society from those criminals and thieves that intend to destroy it. I therefore ask for the defendant for the offence of theft a sentence of four years, two months and one day imprisonment. The defence has the floor to state his conclusions. May it please the Court. Public menace. A danger to society this unfortunate young man, who tried to seize a plastic purse containing 214 pesetas and 35 cents. And I ask: Up to what extent is society not responsible that these outlaws exist? Poor education is usually the cause of these facts. These unfortunates deserve our forgiveness. You've been wonderful, Antonio, I'm surprised. He was a petty thief, I felt sorry for him. Another lawsuit won. 500 pesetas are always good. - What a sum, 500 pesetas! - You will get more lawsuits. - Yes, one every year. - And you can leave that office. - My handbag, Antonio! - Get him! Get him! Come here! You thief! Scoundrel! Don't run away! - Rascal! Criminal! - Leave him. Leave him? This criminal? This slacker? They are all a bunch of lazybones, mischievous, a public menace! A danger to society! Police! Police! Police! The day of tomorrow will also have a night LIFE AROUND US as well as ups and downs The day of tomorrow will have the same ticktack on all clocks Life and love, life around us Life is short but slow. Life is hard but fragile. Life is short but wide. Life is... one. The day of tomorrow will also have poor and rich people. The day of tomorrow will also have someone who cries and sings this song. Life and love, life around us. Life is short but slow. Life is hard but fragile. Life is short but wide. Life is... one. - Poor guy. - Poor Antonio. - A good one is coming down on him. - Another mouth. - In these times. - With 1900 a month. - With discounts. And he barely has coupons. - It's natural he talks with himself. - I would sing zarzuelas. And the Common Market will not solve anything, sure. Oh, you're there... Snooping around my things, eh? Very easy, of course. You save a little from meat, a little more from children's school, and once a week, to the movies to pry into other people's lives! But I don't hold a grudge, you don't meddle, after all. You watch, smile, cry, get bored, who knows, but don't get involved. Today I'm just in a bad mood and I wasn't nice with you. We are having a tough time at home, like everybody, but our future is much worse. One day Josefina felt sick... But you feel sick, Josefina? You're really ill? - Of course honey, don't you see? - And you know what it is? - You are a doctor, you should know. - Of course, we all know. - I don't. Back teeth? - You don't understand? The boy. - "The boy"? For sure? - Of course. News like any other, isn't it? Plainly said like that seemed harmless. I know that children are never born with a silver spoon in their mouth but I wasn't too frightened. Also, Josefina was kind to tell me the first day of the month. We have to add a column: "Boy clothes". Take something from Tobacco. - We need more in Debts. - Take something from Tobacco. There's too little in Transport. - Should I take something from Tobacco? - Look, we have 51 pesetas for Fun. We'll have to tickle ourselves. That month started brilliantly. Here you are, Redondo. Even the end man earns more than me. In that moment the happiness and hope were over Antonio! Can I get my 7 duros back? - Thanks. - Antonio. - You owe me 122. - That's 43. Well, thanks. - You owe me 183, Federico. - 50, 60... - In your case 50 pesetas. - Yes, wait. - Gonz?lez, you owe me... - 37, I think. Don Antonio, you owe me 6 from Bisonte. Beginning of the month, the bell rings, it's not a mystery. The gas bill. Department store. San Rafael Asylum. The day of tomorrow will also have a night... We have to start again. Start again. Start what? Everything. Studying, working, fighting. I will prepare for public examinations and will work in the afternoons. What kind of work? - Selling cars, drawing, in the cinema... - That's too much, Antonio. The office is only 10-13. I can do that in the afternoon. Maybe work in some cabaret at night. You can be an altar boy in the mornings. - Really, Josefina. - You have to help me. - I always do, Antonio. I have to get a status so that when this boy grows up doesn't see his father as a defenceless puppet. Pi = 3.14... - What's that? - This? You don't know? - The logarithm of pi. - And what do you care? - Not for me, it's for the boy. - The boy!? - Of course! We have to put these things in his head. - So early? I'm two months behind because of the doubts. - You think? - Antonio, don't be old-fashioned. After he's 5 years old, whatever you do to form his character is wasted time. - Is it? - Sure. From 5 years old, immediate reality takes our mental space and doesn't leave room for anything. You have to shape the people earlier! If you wait until they are born, it's too late. - Is it possible? - Of course, Antonio, now. Now the kid as all his brain cells free of stupid problems. Then he's born and starts with baby's bottles, diaper rashes, visits... Doesn't have time to learn or build a character. But... you really mean it? - You have a fever? - Antonio, this is common knowledge. All psychotechnicians agree. So you think the kid will learn the logarithm of pi tonight? Not consciously, but stays hidden in his subsconscious. In a few years, in class, "Lesson 25", and the kid, pa, pa, pa... quotes it from memory. - They should have done that to me! This is to stimulate the instinct of harmony. The mother has to sleep watching beautiful things. - That's why you turn your back on me. - Don't joke about it. - What are you listening? - The 9th Symphony. - Aren't you going to bed? - I do, but maybe he's awake. - And he can hear it? - Of course. And it's better if I sleep, so my consciousness doesn't opress him. And he can get lessons through the headphones. - Lessons? - Maths one day, Philosophy another, Political Economy the next... We must have a talented kid so he can thrive in life. That's true. We have to give him a good occupation, a practical career: architect, engineer, physicist. I'd like him to be French. French? In Spain the struggle is very difficult. If we go to work in France, the kid would be French. Everybody says that live there is more open, it's a wider country. But there will be room for the kid here, won't it? We must find the best for our child, Antonio. There are more opportunities there. If he studies Law like you did... maybe he will be a Minister one day. Maybe you are right. In France it's easy to be a Minister for 1 or 2 days. Those distressing days, full of fear and illusion, arrived. We didn't know if the event would be on the 14th, some days before 14th, or Josefina was wrong and it would be much later than 14th. - They called, you have to go. - Oh! - But to your inlaw's. - What?! - You have to go to your inlaw's. - My inlaw's!? - Yes, Josefina was there. - Oh my! - Josefina! Josefina! Where are you? - Easy, kid, she's here. - What happened to her? - Nothing, nothing. - False alarm. - False alarm? Yes, but the obstetrician said to take me home immediately and to be prepared, because anytime... - Josefina... poor girl. - Mr. Redondo, you got a call. - Thank you, thank you. Josefina! Josefina! Hi, Antonio. Calm down. What are you looking for? - The... No? Nothing. A false alarm. But we must be prepared, eh? What's up, doctor? You know what I say? - I don't know, tell me. - Well I say... there's a mistake here. - A mistake? - It's not what we expected? - Sure it is. It's not a cold. but there's a mistake in the calculation. - Aha, so? You have 7 days of peace at least. There is nothing to do for 7 days at least, there was a mistake. In 3 days she goes to the hospital and we wait. - But they say it would be good for her, she's a little weak. - For you. Hello? Hello?! - I can't hear anything! - But they said... Hello. Hello! I hear some crying. Crying?! - A crying boy. - Your child is calling you. Hello? - I don't understand. - Maybe he's asking for money. My son! He was born. You know what it means when your son is born? Ones don't know and others forgot. The birth of a child means invasion! Everybody came to see the boy. My colleagues from work, the friends of my wife, my mother, of course, my father, sure, Josefina's parents obviously, my parents' and her parents' maids, to help. grandma, he's her first great-grandson, of course, and the little brother, so he wouldn't stay at home breaking the furniture... Ah, the neighbour upstairs. I will explain when it's less crowded. The doormen, to sweet-talk. Ah, and Mr. Pi?eiro, an important colleague. Very good of him. - And this gentleman... - Sorry, my mistake. - I was going to another meeting. - It's nothing. I got the floor wrong. I'm going. Good-bye. I rather like this meeting. - Have you seen the boy? - I haven't seen it yet. - That's why I ask. - No. - I just saw him. I go to see the boy now. - My son Antonio has always gone to Dr... - Dr Frias is much better, you can't argue that. - Sure, because you say so it's the best! - He's very competent, that's for sure. - The number 1. - Sure, he would be better... - ...if she was specialised in children. In psychiatry, mother. I can't take on everything, can I? - But what is he sick of? - Nothing! - Nothing? - Now the children have doctors even when they are not sick. I don't understand. Of course you don't understand, even if you have someone to rely on... It's getting late. If I can get to the door, I go. - Excuse me. - Ok. Let's go see the boy. I think we should go. We haven't seen the boy yet. For Antonio the birth of the boy was stimulating. Between us, he's not very talented but he never lacked willpower. Lucky for him, he wasn't home too much in that time. Clerk in the morning, candidate in his free time, and job searcher more than ever. He went through his old jobs, and some new. A lawyer is welcomed everywhere, he's assumed to have a way with words. Or to have people skills, and some culture that allows him to relate with everybody, even socialise with dignity in distinguished circles. You have to admit that Antonio, though not being the brightest, adapts easily in the most diverse jobs. But nevertheless, what really helped us in our family budget was his duties in cinema studios. You... - Take that viscount dress out and dress as an Andalusian. - Andalusian? - Yes. Surprised? - No. No, no. The boy grew and ate incessantly. He soon learned to walk in his baby walker but suddenly, due to some strange whim of nature, started walking backwards. Here, here, Tonini. Here. Here. Here, here, here. - Isn't that strange? - Not so strange. Progresses in life just like his father. The more he grew, the more he spent, he broke, he ate... He ate everything! Tonini, my son! But Tonini, what are you doing? Dirty, baby, dirty. Dirty. Dirty, baby, dirty. Give me. The spoon is not food. I'm afraid what this kid will do when he's older. - Why? - He will even eat the food. - That would be the least of our worries. - I mean our food. Hey sir! - This carnation. - Eh? - For your ear. - For my ear? - Yes. I will wear it, ma'am! I will wear it! - Like this!? - Yes, I think... - The kid eats a lot! I have to study, work, study, work! At the end of they day, a good rest at home! Hello, Redondo. Yes, here you are. Good afternoon, don Antonio. Congratulations. - Antonio, we were waiting for you. - I'm coming. - Why don't you call mom? - Come on, blow out the candles. - Blow, blow. - He's healthy, what does he eat? - Blow, blow. - You saw that? - Very good, very good. - He's lovely. Tell me, what do you feed him? Grated carrot and ground biscuits? - No, ma'am. The boy eats everything. - Everything? - Everything! - That's why he looks like that! - Take him mom, take him. Kiss your granny, kiss your granny. Poor boy... Who wanted cake? Who wanted cake, please? - Too much people, isn't it. - Yes, maybe. If you keep going like this, this flat will not be enough. After four years married we only had one son. But at 20 visits per son... - Maybe you could use my flat. - Your flat? Excuse me, who are you? Ah, you didn't notice me? Yes, of course I noticed, that's why I ask. I noticed you in the lift, on the stairs, but... - I live just upstairs. - I didn't know that. I have a house now and will leave the flat. If you do well, you could join the two. - Sure, sure. It's a good idea. - With some stairs... Redondo. Redondo! Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Thanks. Well, I didn't came just to see how the boy is getting fat and to have a nice quiet chat with a friend. I have a a business proposition. - I accept! - Well.. Yes, yes, I accept. - Without knowing? - What is it? A job? I can do everything. If it's a business I can't lose anything, so... It's not really a business. I'm thinking of quitting all criminal cases. - You don't mean that... - If you want, you can take them. - If I want? Josefina! - You know there are no profits... but you'll get known. I can't take more time from my other matters. - You really mean it? Josefina! - Really, don't be so happy. You know there isn't much work in crime. - Yes, it's a pity. - The criminals have learnt a lot. And everybody turns to business law. But anyway, with many small cases there's something to win. - I can't thank you enough! And if this works, we could make your way to better things. Thank you again, Mr. Pi?eiro. Josefina will be very happy. - Jose! Jose! - Anselmo, it's getting late. You're there chatting and forgetting that we have dinner with the delegates. - Bye. - Bye, gentlemen. ...tilographics, historical and racial. Brotherhood between human beings must not distinguish between nations and races, only then peace will rule the world and only then we will be a big family, people of all countries, all religions, all colours. Well, that's enough international politics for today. Now the multiplication table. 7 times 8? Antonio! Antonio! - What's the matter? - Him, ask him. - He knows the multiplication table. - That's not possible. It is. Ask him, ask him any number. Tonini, baby... What is 7 times 9? 63, you hear that? That's settled, I will give classes of culture for babies. All future mothers will want to have a son like ours. - But Josefina, darling... - Don't doubt, Antonio. "Guarantee of gifted sons". A comfortable and elegant speciality... Go get the door, Clotilde. Where is she now! Clotilde? Very good morning. Mr Lawyer? Ah... yes. Wait, wait, wait. - How hideous, Antonio! There's a horrible man. - What? A sinister man, dressed like a homeless, dishevelled, menacing eyes and a big scar crossing his cheek. - Yes? Yes!? Really, Josefina!? - Yes, Antonio, I think he's a thief! - A thief? I'm coming! Come. Come on in, gentleman. - Good morning, Mr. Lawyer. - Very good morning. - My name is Demetrio Su?rez, aka "El Asunci?n". - Asunci?n? It was my mother's name, no other reason. - Oh, I see. How can I help. - It's about a client from Mr. Pi?eiro. - Yes, he told me. - He wants you to meet him tomorrow at 4 in this place. - He couldn't come? - He's too well-known in this neighbourhood. He worked a lot here last summer. - Pleased to meet you Mr. Lawyer. - Pleased to meet you. Please. - Clotilde! - Silly... Come on, come on. Oh! - Sorry. - I startled her. - Fool! - Sorry, sorry. These girls... - Sorry. Goodbye. Antonio, Antonio! Now you're thinking of getting a new psychotechnical machine. No, but tomorrow we'll buy a folding chair for the kid. Come on, honey. My clients are waiting. If more thieves keep coming I will buy that chequered dress. They will come, you'll see. Mr. Pi?eiro had a lot of clients like them. But I'm not sure, this criminal field, with your lack of character... - I lack character? - You realize that now? What bothers me about this occupation is the house. - The house? Yes, I have a lot to read, to study, to see people. And at home we always have arguing visits, a maid that throws pots and pans, A crying baby... You can avoid those typical noises from a home, Antonio. Everybody knows that family... - Eyes front, Antonio. - Nice shoes. Did you see? The thing is that our home is too small. I never had headaches and now... - Some hypnosis and you'll feel like new. - I'd take an aspirin. - If we could connect the flat upstairs... - Uff, what a fortune! - Yes, but with those thieves... - They are poor, Josefina. We won't earn money until we don't defend crimes by honest people. Jesus, everybody's looking at me! I know they do, but you can't tell me! I have to pretend I don't see it, and you have to pretend that I didn't see it, and that you haven't seen it either. What are you saying Antonio? What? You want me to beat them? Should I knock them around? Then a trial, and I lose as a client what I will earn as a lawyer. No way! Besides, if you didn't dress like that... - What about it? - I don't know, you dress too flashy. Please Josefina, the thieves are waiting for me. - That's enough! You look them all! - I was getting bored. If you get bored look at a policeman! A policeman, why should I look at a policeman? Sleep, Adelaida, sleep! I command you! - Josefina! - Now sirs... - His a trickster! - I know. We'll begin the experiment. Watch Adelaida's clairvoyance in her deep hypnotic sleep. Adelaida, what's in my hand? Five fingers. And the other one? A fist. He really economises in equipment. Now sirs, I will force the subject to tell the truth. The most intimate truth of what she's thinking right now. That truth that we never dare to speak up because that could result in a feud, or hate from our loved ones, persecution, exile. Adelaida, the truth. I command you to tell the truth. What do you want to know? Do you want to know what she thinks of you right now? You're scared, frightened, terrified! If things get bad we could make a living doing that. - You could hypnotise me and I... - Don't be absurd. I do scientific hypnotism, this is a trick. What do you think of this people? The truth. I can't believe they got nothing better to do, what a country. No, don't tell the truth anymore, we'll be left alone! Let's see, Adelaida, focus. What colour is this lady's dress? Mrs. See? It's red and white. - She sleeps and he passes it on. - Come one, it's a math trick. A math trick? Anyone of you wants to feel the effects of hypnotic sleep? - Hah, hypnotic sleep! - Also a trick? - Of course, he's got a partner. - I wouldn't do it just in case. - Pighead! Anyone? I do! But Josefina! Sleep! You! Dad! Dad! Dad! We were getting impatient. - You won't believe how difficult was to find the place. - I can guess. Let's have something to drink first. - If you will work with us you want to know the place. - Yes, of course. This is my cousin, Ignacio Fern?ndez L?pez, known as "Fern?ndez L?pez". It's about our uncle Ceferino L?pez, known as "The Stiff". He's quitting. In our family we can't explain why, isn't it? He's the cleanest there is in his job. - Well, he's quitting. They got him. - Hey man, two moonshines. Do you know the details of this matter? No sir. And usually when he was planning something he always told us. - To start training, you know? But he had side jobs sometimes. His wife keeps an eye on his earnings, and needs to get something for his card game. This thing was a blunder, so we didn't know anything. Ah, so I'll need to speak with him. You'll see this will be a useful visit. - For me? - Yes, you're just starting, no? - Yes, well, I'm starting with crime, the other thing... But you need to learn about this, chat with people in the know, and the truth is, you will not find anyone more up-to-speed in the Code than our uncle "The Stiff". - I don't doubt that, but if you had told me yesterday that you didn't know anything, I could be talking to with him right now. We've brought here because Fern?ndez L?pez and I wanted to ask you about a personal enquiry. We always work by the book, you see. - Yes. - Modern school. - With this system you get ahead. In the past, people passed time in the pen, and it wasn't too bad, but what about family? How can they live by? But the problem right now is that we cannot manage. - My uncle "The Stiff" is not here. - I see. If we start working in some house by day, the sentence is lower than if we do it by night. we know that. - Nocturnality is an aggravating circumstance. - Yes, exactly. - The thing is, we'll pull a job next week, God willing, and we need to clear up some information. If you don't mind, we'll take a look together. - Honestly, I don't know if I should. - How will we do it then? Our uncle will not come out in months, assuming that you do good at the trial. If "El Asunci?n" and I do it, maybe we don't get caught, but if we don't do it you won't... I mean, no way you will get your... - Fees. - Yes, exactly. It's some information that you would give to anyone here. - Maybe, I don't deny it but... - What I'm saying is that if we don't... - Yes, I understood. - Alright. If we enter by day and don't break anything, it's a lesser felony, yes? - Yes, because there is no "breaking". - And if I go alone the sentence would be less because it's not a gang. - Exactly, yes. And if I use the window instead of the door, the sentence would be reduced more, yes? - Yes because you don't break the lock. - And if I don't carry guns? Well I think you just want to get an award I think! By day, through the door... Only if you don't flirt with the maid. - No, breach of trust. - A serious aggravating circumstance. - Hey, you!! Put your things away. Don't be so bold, guys. So. You want to come with us and take a look at the house? - Well... - If we don't... For our family. For society. Watch out! Shake off the dust, the dogs will bark if you are sloppy. Yes, yes. Ok, ok. And only reports from a legal point of view. - You're not in the business. - Ok, ok. - Good morning. - Hello. Whistle if you need anything. Antonio, my dear Antonio! He's been caught! - Carmen! - What are you doing here? - I was on an errand. - You didn't know I live here? No, I didn't. I just got a special whisky. Why don't you try it? - No, thanks. Whisky and I... - What about a coffee then? - I am with some friends, I can't stay. - I didn't see them. Tell them to come. To come? No, no, they can't. - They can't? - They are thieves. - What did you say!? - Thieves. You know my occupation. - Oh, of course, I forgot. - A cigarette? - Yes, please. Did you call? - Milk? - Really, I don't have time. Call your friends, thieves are normal people after all. I had a thief friend, when I was very young. - It would be awkward for them. - Alright then, two coffees. Let them wait. After all in they work they have to wait. Are they important or just common thieves? I just met them, they are new clients, but they rather look unfortunate. Look, you can see them there. Uf, poor boys. They look like little pilferers. Yes, of course, I'm just starting. I hope to have more important thieves. - Why don't we give them something? - What? - Yes, a few things they could take. - But... We would spare them a few days of work. It's not a nice job, you know. Call them. - Call them? - Yes, of course. But, it's... You are so shy! - You heard? - Of course I heard! It was her. - What we do? - We shouldn't. It's odd. - We better stay. - Right. He's coming out. - Oh my god! - What a guy! What time do you think it is to arrive home? - It's... - And look at you! What a mess! - I walked a lot. Dinner's ready? - You're hungry? - And tired. Dog-tired. - A homeless you just had left to be. - Who knows where you've been. - I've been working, you know. Oh, guess who I ran into. Carmen, our neighbour. Remember her? She has a nice house. - I guess you met her by chance. - Yes, by pure chance. - And she invited me for coffee. - I see, what a friendly neighbour. She reminded me about the flat. She's willing to make it easy for me. - I'm sure. So you spent the afternoon with her. - What are you talking about? I spent the day with that gentleman and his pal. - I wasn't even 5 minutes with Carmen. - Oh, Carmen! - Such familiarity. - Don't be absurd, Josefina. - We always called her Carmen. - No, you called her "bullfighter". Aha! - You are jealous! - Of course I am! Anybody would be! Really? I'm a Don Juan now? No, but everybody does what they want with you. Please Josefina, leave it now and let's eat. I have to start right now with this case. Don't change the subject and tell me what you really did! - Nothing. Work, have a coffee, I told you. - And coming at 11! Don't tell me a story, Antonio. You know that you have to tell me the truth if I just want it. - Really? I didn't know. - Of course. Remember the trickster. - But I don't believe you'd dare... - Don't make me. I don't believe that in marriage it's fair to... Why are you looking at me like this Josefina? Did you... Tell me the truth. The truth! I command you to tell the truth. - Love! - Oh! - Come here, you're gorgeous! - Antonio, please. What a deal I made when I married you. Who has such a tall wife with such a low budget. - Leave me, Antonio. Please. - Come here showgirl! You move better than a swing. - Quiet, Antonio! Sit down! I command you. You make me drool! - No, don't come! - You said something? - No, nothing. You can serve dinner. You're getting stupid, Clotilde. We think that you are the less stealing groundhog of the neighbourhood. Lately you steal in such a small quantity that you won't go very far. If you don't get better we'll have to fire you. Wake up. Wake up! Eh? What's the matter? Oh, the soup! What happened? Something happened? No, nothing. You dozed off. I think I will hypnotise you again, Antonio. The circumstances of premeditation and highway robbery pointed by the prosecutor are not applicable to the defendant as no one could testify that "The Stiff" was seen in that place on the day of the facts. Therefore I expect his sentence to be reduced, as clearly the justice wants in this case, to six months of imprisonment. That's all, your honour. Will the defendant please rise. Has the defendant anything to add to his defence? May it please the Court. I'd like to support an opposed view from those from the prosecutor and the defence, since neither ammend 21 from article 332 nor 4 from 102, nor Supreme Court ruling from Oct 15th 1935 have been considered. I request to be stated for a possible appeal. Moreover, article 551 from Penal Code, quoted by the defence, and decree-law from Oct 14th 1947 named by the prosecution cannot be considered as they clearly contradict with rulings from Supreme Court dated Jun 12th 1948 and Sep 14th 1949. - He's a genius! - Has the gift of the gab! So I suggest, with all due respect, that unless my memory errs with dates and numbers said, the appropriate sentence is just 15 days of imprisonment. Having to declare the cost of litigation. - A glass to celebrate. - Congratulations. - You've been marvelous. - Thank you. - Better than the lawyer. - No, that lawyer know what he's doing. - Congratulations, Ceferino. - What a lawyer you've... - Thanks for your speech. - No... - I suggested less days, but what could I do, put yourself in my place. Listen, don't take it the wrong way, but I've been thinking lately. I decided to turn straight. I'll come to see you someday. This decision honours you. But uncle, how will we live by? Our trade requires more work and study than what it seems. We have to run, stay up all night, dress up, climbing up pipings... It's a hard work, man! And when you're free, you have to swot up the on code. - But uncle, you are better than ever. Isn't it? - Sure, uncle. No, no. I'm not a spring chicken anymore. I regret to lose a client, but I don't have any other choice than to encourage you to follow the path of good. Think about Encarnaci?n and the girl. They will be skint for your madcap idea. I do it for them too. There are almost no profits from this, the middlemen take almost all. You can do what you want, but I go over to commerce. - But uncle... The trial, after all, was a success for me and things started to get better. We made the flat bigger and to avoid separation and jealousy we set up our businesses there. See a short documentary about our home in that prosperous time. The hall, that also served as waiting room. There waited Josefina's students and also my clients. Months later the works were still going on and you could see workers anywhere. This one's trying to prevent the tiles to make a melodic noise, that was like background music of our home, but I couldn't get used to it. Break time: I read. Josefina sews. The boy plays. The worker works. But we had almost everything: a washing machine, a vacuum cleaner, stairs, some clothes for me, some more clothes for the kid, and Antonio's wardrobe. _ Liquor for fun, soda Gran Via. _ - Sales "The Crocodile". - The most assorted cloths... Josefina, aren't you coming to bed? - Did you check if there's any worker? - Yes, there isn't any. - ... "Frontier Law". - "The Crocodile". You'll find the most assorted cloths in "The Crocodile". Cloths that aren't cloths, "The Crocodile Sales". Are you sleepy? Not really. But we have to rest. Are you tired? A little. - And you? - Also a little. - Marisa, where are you running to? - To "The Crocodile Sales". - "The Crocodile Sales". - Modern draper's shop. A thrilling movie, "Frontier Law". "The Crocodile Sales" Life is hard but fragile. Life is short but wide. Life is... one. - Antonio. - Yes? - Don't you think that Tonini is making us old? - No honey, why? - He grows so much. - Bah, like all kids. - Don't you think he's too lonely? - Oh, no. - The house is always full. - I don't mean that. I mean... I don't know. Time goes on... but of course, maybe one day we will have a girl. - A girl? - We will not live forever. - What if you are widowed? - What an idea, honey! We have to think about it. If someday you are left without me... just an idea. You will miss to have a girl, and Tonini too. Yes, I agree. It would be nice to have a boy and a girl. But that would mean more expenses. You see Tonini, we have to get new clothes every time. Girl's clothes are cheaper. We can even use my own clothes. And shoes. He uses 3 pairs in the same time I use just one. And they are the same price as mine. He grows and grows. School will cost a fortune. And when they stop taking "Pelardon" they have to eat more solids. - Girls spend less than boys. - But spend anyway. And when they are older they bring more worries. What quality would we give her? It should be a career. We should prepare her to fight through life. They say that two can eat as cheaply as one. - A girl... - But since Tonini was born we spend as we were 6. But things are going much better. Kids bring luck, Antonio. When we earn more money. Uncle, some men are looking for you. Tell them to come. - Good morning. - Are you Ceferino L?pez "The Stiff"? - Yes, sir. How can I help you? - Please come with us. But what! Listen, this must be a mistake. You are under arrest for flight of capital, fraud, non-fulfillment of tax law and falsification of public documents. But what, hey, I'm innocent. I've been innocent for a long time! - You'll talk later. - Let's go. I don't get involved in anything! You are wrong, my uncle is retired. - Make way. - How do you want me to tell you. I give you my word. Have you seen what an injustice? We have the licence applications in order, because our compensations are handled by a gentleman in Barcelona, he processes the petitions to request the permit to submit the final petitions. Well, what's the specific accusation? I dunno, something like flight of documents, public fraud, non-fullfilment of falsification. - Eh? A nice case. My way to civil law. - He's innocent, I swear. - You don't need to convince me but appearances and his record, specially his record, are against him. - Now that he turned honest... - Good morning, Mr Antonio. - Very good morning. Let's examine the facts with serenity. - What happened? - Su?rez got too nervous and... An insignificant mistake, I'm sure. Just inform Mr. Pi?eiro... - Better Mr. Llobet, don't you think? - Yes, you are right. Just give a call to Mr. Llobet... - Who is Mr. Llobet? - You don't know Llobet from "Associated"? - No, I don't. - He's the one that manages all this since the merging with "Agrios Ltd", through "Substitutes Castilla" they took over the consortium. - When Mr Llobet clears everything up, don Ceferino will have dinner at home. In that case we'll call Mr. Llobet. Now that he turned honest... Don't worry my friend, he will come out soon. Mr. Llobet? Ah... He's in Switzerland already. "C. LOPEZ" CASE GENERAL FOOD PRODUCTS Now that I chose the right track... Let's go to the facts, Ceferino, the facts. Facts are very clear, Mr. Antonio. You know very well about "General Food Products", talk with my associate, get all the paperwork. Yes, that's absolutely necessary. And if you see something you don't understand, ask Mr. Llobet. - We can't get Mr. Llobet. - How could I know if he was introduced by Mr. Pi?eiro! He fooled me, don Antonio, and I know nothing about commercial law. Easy, Ceferino, easy. - I'm sorry for Encarna and the girl. - Calm down, calm down. - We'll make up something. - The truth, counselor, the truth. The truth will be useless in this matter. We have to prove that you were not involved in the deceit, and that you had no malicious intent. - How would I have, we verbally agreed to exchange the products! Verbally, verbally... Who's going to testify? - They will not believe you. - Mr. Llobet. - Get Mr. Llobet! - We can't count on Mr. Llobet. We have to find someone else and another version of the facts. I didn't get involved in anything dirty, I have a general ledger and an accountant. Yes, I know, but it's not enough to be honest, we have to prove it. You know better than anybody. I was sick of that hustle. I only wanted my girl to become a lady so she can get married to an engineer and I would die in peace. I would like to get my obituary printed in the ABC paper. You see, trifles. Also, you sold products five days after it was forbidden to sell them. What would I know, I only read the Sunday magazine since I retired. ILLEGAL EXCHANGE OF FOOD PRODUCTS SHOPKEEPER IN JAIL THE STIFF GOES BACK TO JAIL It's on all the papers, Antonio. Of course, it's a matter of 7 or 8 millions. Then it's what we were waiting for! - Come on in. - Good evening, Mr. Pi?eiro. This is our man. What do you think? Has good appearance. That's important in a witness. - Of course. - Any experience? - Yes, he has worked a lot. But only in the north. - I'm just starting here. - You see? Another advantage. He arrived here recently, so he has not been used too much yet. Is he in the loop? Does he know the facts? - No, he always works by gesture. - By gesture? Yes. If you open your arms, he says "yes." If you point him with your finger, he says "no". Try it. Isn't it true that you were present when Mr. Llobet in the name of "Associated," verbally commited to take care of the marginal expenses in the exchange between "Food Products" and "Substitutes"? Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Was it arranged that the defendant had to pay at the expense of "Food Products" the difference between cash and credit? - No, no. No, no... - Eh! - The master can't see you now. - It's urgent. Tell him we're here. To go to his office we have to cross the room. - They are working, you see. - We have to deliver this documents. Alright, alright. Wait here, wait, ok? Some clients of the master. _ All right, now ecstasy. Concentrate for a moment. Close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. This is for you. Beauty and purity have to be on your head. Since life begins, they have to be on your head. You see. In this house, everybody makes noise except for the kid. It's not Josefina's fault, I know, she can't cancel her classes if we earn so little. Workers have to work, our maid has to sing, but I'm right to be angry. And I think I can't be condemned to find a comfortable place to study and prepare my lawsuits specially when they are as important as this one. A journalist, sir. - Let her in. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Antonio Redondo? - Yes, miss. I come for an interview about the matter of the "Associated." - What paper? - For "Informations". I write the interviews for "The Man of the Day" since four years ago. I used to write the column "Science and Woman", but I prefer this because, with exceptions, I don't believe in feminism. So you started very young in journalism. I started when I was 16 in "The New Spain" in Oviedo, but I quitted because I worked too little. - You like to work? Yes, but not any job. I like literature because it's also an escape for the spirit. Ah, you have a real calling for journalism. Don't believe that. My real calling is to write drama, but it's hard to release. The established authors stand in the way of the innovators. Ok Mr. Redondo, I think I have enough. A pleasure, miss. Yes, you are right, Costa Brava is very good. But anyway this year we're thinking of going to San Sebasti?n because if we get the car in those days we can always go to take a walk in Biarritz, San Juan de Luz... And maybe we have a girl next year. CEFERINO L?PEZ, "THE STIFF" ON TRIAL And if the master wins the lawsuit I will ask him for a raise. With this kind of lawsuits I have more work after all. ...Granada in 1492. The Catholic Monarchs conquered Granada in 1492. What do I know! The Catholic Monarchs conquered Granada in 1492. The Catholic Monarchs conquered Granada in 1492. Leasing. - With no commitment to pay with... - Tonini! ...had been contracted on date... Tonini, dear, kids don't play with the code! Stick with chess and your things. Come on! "C. LOPEZ" CASE GENERAL FOOD PRODUCTS ...ups and downs... The day of tomorrow will have the same ticktack on all clocks - How is it going? - The lawsuit goes good, my head worse and worse. Clotilde, shut up! The master can't work! Don't you shout either, Josefina. Both of you are driving me crazy. - Alright, excuse me! - Such an easy lawsuit, practically won. If I keep going like this, tomorrow I will make a fool of myself. I will talk about the noise, your patients, the workers. It's empty! - Poor Antonio. - Yes, I've had enough. The voices, the noise, oh. Eh? Think. Pain doesn't exist. Nothing hurts. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. There is no fatigue. There is no noise. Silence. Silence. There is no pain. No noise. There are calm places. Silence. Carmen, bring me some coffee and silence. Yes, Carmen. Carmen. Love. Tranquility. Peace. Peace. Peace. Tell me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. What women do you like? Come on, start. Carmen? Carmen... Elena, Mar?a, - Josefina... - Who is this Josefina? - You. And you name me last, like an old rag! The last one! - You didn't let me finish. - There are more? You're a monster, a... you see? You see, you lack character. You like all: tall, short, skinny, fat. Carmen is a little on the plump side, but not fat... and she's tall. She's the only one that gives me coffee, the others are from the office. They are cute, but I have nothing with them, really. We are finished! You hear, Antonio? It's bad enough you are worthless, but I thought you loved me at least. And you're... despicable! Despicable! - Please, don't shout. I'll have to go with Carmen to that calm place. Don't push my buttons, Antonio! You are a wimp, Antonio. You still are! And that's because you lack character! Everybody does what they want with you. Bye. Could that be true that I lack character? You all have, haven't you? You're brave, kind-hearted, greedy, hot-headed, cowards, you're something. Wha about me? I don't have any quality? Maybe, I don't feel anything anyway. Is it the same with you? He's hot-headed! Has always been, and that's his problem. We're finished! We're finished forever. It's not Antonio's fault, I'm sure. It would be excusable if he was passionate. But he's nothing, he's simple. - You're exaggerating. If he was simple, nothing would have happened. I think you shouldn't do that, specially the day before the trial. - But he will lose it! He will! - You can't make a decision like this. You have to understand that Antonio has always been liked by the ladies. He's an attractive man, it's not his fault. Not his fault? Then tell me, who's fault is it? - You, as always, Josefina. - Outrageous! Believe me. He's always been hot-headed. Hot-headed! I can't explain it! And tomorrow at the trial, who knows what he will do. That's the reason of all his misfortunes. He's not calm, doesn't think, gives in to fantasy... When he fell in love with his wife he didn't let us give our opinion. He throw her to us, happy, excited, overjoyed. We looked at him terrified. The girl was fine, but really, nothing to be so excited. He rised her up with his strong arms and started to shout: "Mine, mine forever, forever!". A gangster, that's what he is! He married our Josefina to exploit her. He and his buddies looked like a gang. - Should we, boss? - Won't be a waste of time? There's good material. Antonio, how happy I am that you came. Come, Manolo, come. Mom, this is my mother. - Pleased to meet you, Antonio. - Likewise. - You have pastries? - What? - Where are the pastries! - There. Tell me, what do you think? - I don't have a good feeling. - But you just met him. - You don't have reasons to suspect him. - I don't know... He didn't go to a good school, that's for sure. I still think he's an ordinary kid. Kid! This noise is getting disturbing. To the point, gentlemen. I think you'll have grandsons. Don't pay attention to my wife. I've always thought that Antonio is a good kid. When he graduated and got his lawyer licence the man stayed in his robes even in bed. The thing about my son is that he's too handsome. When he was a student all the neighbours were crazy for him, it's not his fault. Good morning Mom. Come, your breakfast is ready. Beaten egg yolks, orange juice, fruit, honey, a slice of ham, butter toasts, a big cup of chocolate. You have to eat. - Hello Antonio. Did you sleep a lot? - I dreamed, father. They just called you: Purita, Elena, Ruth, Chon, Berta and Angelines. - Watch yourself, Anto?ito. - That's the basketball team, mom. I'm in the sports department in the faculty. - Don't speak, eat. Eat! Anita! Oh, please excuse me, madam! When the master looks at me... - I'm sure she's a neighbour. - What a nuisance. A real nuisance! Since daybreak, all the girls in the neighbourhood got into our house with some excuse. - May I have some parsley? - Sure, girl. Antonio! I came to ask Antonio for some notes. Please, can you tell me the time? _ He's a fool! Nothing more than a fool. When he went to the office, his colleagues took advantge of him. With that personality he intends to win such an important lawsuit? He's gonna need a miracle. He can't even wear the robes! He can't get the respect from anybody. Tomorrow at the trial, he will be easily tricked by the prosecutor. He will forget everything and will only see the women. And if the prosecutor comes up with a female witness, there's nothing to do. Tell me the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Good morning, sir. - Hello dad. - My son, I'm going to say the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. You're not as ugly as your father because you're still a child. You're not as poor as your father because you're still a child. And you are not as tall as your father because you're still a child. But you will grow up, you will shave, you will get married... you will work, work, and work, and one day you will be as ugly, poor and tall as your father. - Are you finished? - One second. - You're very nervous. - The most important lawsuit of my life. How could I write all this? Come here. You are very indifferent with me today. Two sugars. Or three so you'll be sweeter? But the judge won't fall for all this! I had a friend who as a judge. Take this. - You could give me some cognac. - Why not? Just tell me. That's the people you find in finances. You are not fine, Antonio. There's something in your look. I've never been better, I even feel lighter. - It's not hot. - Oh my God, how demanding! You are different, Antonio. What's the matter with you? Your eyes are more round. Tell me the truth. The truth. You want to know how many women are there in my life too. - Me too? - Yes, like her. - Her, who? - "Her" is always Josefina, my wife. - Antonio, don't be so vulgar. Josefina is my wife, my lover, my partner, my friend, my boss. - So what am I, a bartender? - You are a very calm place. Antonio! Antonio! Don't you love me anymore? - Well... I never loved you. - Antonio! I've always thought you were a little snooty. What are you saying? Have you gone crazy, sugar? Don't you remember you spend your idle time here with me? - You must like something from me. - Your sofa. Antonio! Silence... your liquors... your coffee... your music... your velvet curtains, so soft, so soft. Nothing else? Nothing else? What were you thinking about? - So you didn't come for me? - For you? No, come on. I came for this tranquility, for your old and silent maid... - Maid! Maid! - Come! He's crazy, he's crazy! - And all this empty place. Empty! No one, no workers. To walk, to move around as you want. And for this silent, silent slippers. Silent! - Good morning, don Antonio. - Good morning, my friend. What a harsh face you have today. Well, it's always a little green, but today you look truly disgusting. I just got a nice deal with your company. I bought half of the tomatoes shipment. - The one that came yesterday? Too bad my friend, almost all of them are bad. "General Food Products" got them almost for free, Mr. Giner told me. How's it going, don Antonio. A cigar? I just made a deal and we were celebrating. I made a contract with don Heliodoro for Alzira oranges for the whole season. I congratulate you, my friend, you really tricked him. Because Mr. Escribano told me that Nules oranges are getting cheaper. And if you didn't find a sucker like your friend Gregorio, you would get stuck with them. - Hey, you tricked me. - Hey you, I don't trick no one. - Hey, I will not tolerate...! - I'm a gentleman! We have to break up the deal! I'm not interested! - How come!? A deal is a deal! - We didn't sign it! What's going on out there? There comes Mr. Redondo. You have the papers ready for Mr. Antonio? - Yes, here they are. - Give me. - Good morning. - Here you are. I just got authorized to go to the hearing. Let's see how you behave yourself. - You really are short. - Listen, Giner. All deals are being cancelled. We should lower the price of the leaf vegetables in less than 15 minutes or we'll be stuck with them. If you're going to buy leafy vegetables, you should wait 15 minutes. They will be cheaper. It's in their best interest. - Come here, we have to clear this up! - There's nothing to clear up! - Mr. Redondo told us. - What the...!? - He said tomatoes were bad! - How could he say that? - That leafy vegetables are falling! - And told us not to buy...! - Mr. Redondo said it? - What's wrong with him? - Did you saw that strange look? - I noticed something strange like he was talking nonsense. - And today is the trial! Oh my! We have to call Mr. Pi?eiro! Like talking nonsense? It is strange. I will call his home. He looked like sleepwalking to me. They quarreled last night and the missus stood him up... To her parents! She even asked to send her clothes there. You know, her things. Imagine, I hypnotised him to cure his headhache and started talking about an affair he has. Completely sure. Just in case I put him in a trance to speak the truth and started to let some truths out that would shock any Sergeant. And you left him like that? What should I do, stay there listening? It was not a good time! Will it last long? Bah, it will be over tonight. He will be the liar he always was. Tonight? The trial will begin in a few minutes! How will he go to the hearing like this? We have to do something. If the trial has began, we are done for. Will the defendant please rise. What is your name? Ceferino L?pez Gallego. - Age. - 54. Occupation? Industrial. Do you consider yourself author of the offences of falsification and misappropriation charged by the public prosecutor and do you agree with the requested sentence? - Well I don't, sir. - Public hearing. - Public hearing. You can come in. To the Courthouse. Hurry! May the witness prepare to answer the questions from the defence. The defence may question the witness. How do you find Madrid? Do you like it? - What is he saying? - He's a little strange. - Like he is visiting. Restrict yourself to the questions regarding this case. But he has just arrived in Madrid. - He usually works as a witness in Bilbao, isn't it? - Yes, yes, yes. And he doesn't know a word about this matter, isn't that true? No, no, no. No. - Oh my god! - And you missed the best part. He's been talking about clothing with a witness for the prosecution. We have to do something. We have to do something! ...really soon to Bilbao, don't you think? - Yes, yes, yes. Yes. So I believe we have to let him go. As your honour has seen, he has no idea of this matter. Alright, see you next time. Please understand, ma'am, he is not himself and doesn't know what he's saying. He will say the truth, he's saying it since last night. How awful! Poor son! Will he stay like this forever? I have nothing to do with him. I don't know him! He's not my husband! - He's the father of your son. - I'm his only parent. Sons are of the mothers. - Josefina, don't talk nonsense. - Have you called another psychoanalyst? - I checked and it's not possible. - She must do it herself. Herself! - That's basic. Do you realize the importance of this matter, madam? He can only speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth! - How awful! - That's not possible. - Please reconsider. Reconsider! Fourth time offender, and we must believe his word, his intentions. It may be sad to say it, but despite our good heart, in a man with such a criminal record so clear and persistent as the defendant's it is very difficult to put our trust. We know he committed larceny, robbery, fraud and maybe other crimes, that he managed to get away thanks to his reasoning skills that no one calls into question. It's impossible for Ceferino L?pez not to be "The Stiff". Not having attacked a bakery in 1945, not having swindled an old woman in 1952 with the gramophone trick, and not having burglarized the house of marquises of C?scar in 1956. And only by erasing all these facts from his life, would the defendant gain our trust. That we believed his word. It's impossible, but then the defendant would be saved. Of course! Of course, of course. For the record, my intervention is strictly professional. First of all is to win the lawsuit. Then you can sort out your problems. Come in, come in. To the Courthouse, hurry! Go as fast as you can. I must warn you, from a distance is very difficult. I don't know if I can. Why beat about the bush. We either believe his word or we don't! Because about the facts... I believe him, uh? I have sympathy for him. I like him! And he comes to visit. Gives presents to my kid and he invites us every Thursday for tea. I'm certain he is innocent. Having said that, I must warn your honour that the fact that I believe in his innocence means nothing, because the truth is that I'm rather simple and everybody fools me. The fact is that "The Stiff" has signed documents that could get anyone into jail. That he carried out an exchange... - Go, go. having only a temporary permit which no one can certify. - I have to get closer. That he put into market on the 22nd although a regulation forbidding any sales was published on the 2nd. And what a life this so called "Stiff" has had, isn't that right? Why should be fool ourselves. So, I think this lawsuit is impossible to win. - Outrageous! - A disaster! - Your girl! It's your girl's fault. - Shut up, your son is so dumb... If she fulfilled her obligations... The wife can't leave the husband. - Come on girl, do it. Did you see, ma'am? - From bad to worse. - Shut up! I can't direct him well. - ...I don't think will convince no one, because, whether we want it or not, his records matter. If the records of a honest man matter, why shouldn't matter the records of a felon? And "The Stiff" was one. You were, my friend, you were. I know you are a good man now, but I can't prove it. "Stiff", I see you in the Oca?a prison. But you will not be alone. I think the place is crowded. - Accept it. - How's it going? - I don't know mom. - 6 years and a day... No reaction yet. - ...is the lest you will get. Don't put that face, I am sorrier than you are. But others will be sorry too. the people that you less expect will suffer the consequences. For example, there you have... Clotilde, our maid. She was hoping a raise, but if we lose the lawsuit, no way. And not only Clotilde, important people too. For example... "Carvajal Tailor Shop. A cap and gown, 3425 pesetas. "340 to pay as deposit." Our guy Carvajal will have to wait, don't you think? - How is it going? - So, "Hogarsa Estate Agent's". - I have the contract here... - How is it going? - I must warn the defence... - No reaction. - No reaction. - Yes, yes, I know but... - He's not responding. - ... the other documentation... I think it will turn out much worse for his defence... No! There's no time to lose, we have to do something. We have to do something! Call Revenga. Impossible! How did you allow him to talk that much? Call Elizalde. He's telling the truth? What is the police doing? IBERIA Spanish Airlines Just look how things got complicated. Such a small world. If it weren't for your odd jobs, your robberies, we would all be alright. And so, you see, the cat got out of the bag and the big fishes are at the edge of their seat. For example, the partners of "Associated". They must be suffering. Because, here between us, would you tell me why they merged with the consortium? And there's something musty about that "Substitutes" thing... If you didn't do all that you did in the past, we would win the case and everybody would happy. Imagine, if I could win this... "Case won, cases increase." We would have many clients. Don't you think? "The Stiff" would invite us every Thursday for tea, and we could do the same. Doesn't the defence think that his report is keeping us from this dispute? Excuse me your honour, if the prosecutor has mentioned the records why shouldn't I talk about the consequences? And the consequences are that Stiff's girl will have to marry someone in the trade. No obituary on the ABC newspaper. And Josefina, if she comes back, and I think she will... will have to keep on teaching her classes. And we will keep on spending the summer in Manzanares river, going by subway, and the Amusements column at 32.50. Ah... and Tonini will never be an engineer or an architect because after the girl's birth... When the girl comes we will struggle for all four of us. However if your lessons are useful, maybe they come out less dumb than their father and can help, because for now, we don't have any choice but to adjourn they day of tomorrow. But what can we do. The public prosecutor is right. Completely right! I think "The Stiff" is a nice guy. I love him a lot, and personally, I think he would not hurt anyone. But we are not supporting personal judgement here we are defending society! And to society in general, an individual with the personal circumstances of "The Stiff" must seem a real public menace! That's what any normal person would say, any man on the street. That's how the masses would think. But are we or are we not jurists? Why did we study so much? Why did we write so many laws, so many ammends, so many clarifications? Why did we add so many thousands of articles in the codes from Justinian to the present days? To talk? To think as any son...? CIVIL CODE Josefina! - Antonio... - Josefina! - I thought I would never find you. - You were looking for me? Josefina, when you get upset and leave, stop in all shop windows. And you, when you go to look for me, look at all the women even if you don't think that's me, you know? I will forgive you. Sir, you are on the papers! The defender, in the dock? Mr. Antonio Redondo, charged of slander. 14 lawsuits filed against him. Life. THE END
