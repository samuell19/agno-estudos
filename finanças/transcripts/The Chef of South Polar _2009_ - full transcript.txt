I don't want your half-drunk beer. - I'll get a fresh one. - Not now, later. Oh, wait. What now? - Can I pick it up? - My mistake. Hey, wake up! Here you go. Why give up now?

It's located at a mountain top,... 1,000 km inland from the Showa Station on the coast line. Average temperature is -54째C. It's a higher elevation than Mt.Fuji, with an altitude of 3,800m above sea level,... one of coldest spots on earth. No penguins, seals and even viruses can survive here. Air pressure is low, 60% less than that of Japan. One gets out of breath easily. Yasushi Kawamura, called 'Nee-yan'. A supporting member of deep-ice core project. Masahiko Hirabayashi, Hira-san. An Atmospheric scientist from the National Institute of Polar Research. Ryo Nishihira, Bon,... from a News Agency, the communication staff.

Mr. Nishimura, do we have soy beans? No, we don't, but we have peanuts. He is good at utilizing peanuts. Thank you. Peanuts, that will do. Who plays a devil? Speaking of devil... Let's eat first.

Close the door! Hey, close it please! One-year food consumption for a person is about one ton. No supermarket to run to when we run out of food. Our foods are all frozen, dried, canned stuff. We don't have foods that can not be frozen. The water boiling point is 85째C because of low pressure. So dried noodles won't cook well. I brought various seeds to grow vegetables,... but have had success only with radishes and bean sprouts. What is your weight? What? It's lunch time. We've prepared rice balls for lunch with steaming pork and vegetable soup. Tasty rice balls with salmon, beef, salted cod roe. Today's special, salted salmon roe from Hokkaido. Please come to the dining table. Where's the Chief? Which one is cod roe? Where's the Chief? Oh, it's hot! Can't find salted cod roe. - No? - No. I want to go home. Mr. Nishimura, would you run away with me? Where? We'll die if we do. Of all places, Antarctica... It's a terrible demotion, a demotion of the worst kind. I'm just a car mechanic. I want to go home and go to the pachinko parlor. Chief, it's still February. Mr. Nishimura, close the door please. You are killing me! It's 1:30 pm. It's water making time. Water is very important for us. We can't survive without it. Let's make water. I'll take it. Here at the Dome, water is the most precious thing. There is no water pool, so we defrost snow to make water. Fortunately, we have limitless snow. - Mr. Nishimura. - Yes? Great news. What? Have the Hiroshima Carp won? I just talked to Showa station. They told me that we have lobsters. Lobsters? The former crew forgot about them. Lobsters? Did I hear lobsters? We have lobsters here. Tonight, we will have fried lobsters. You mean Lobsters, right? They are too big for a deep fry. What about lobsters? We have lobsters here. Then tonight's menu is fried lobsters. Sashimi is better. It's too good to fry. - Did I hear lobsters? - We have huge lobsters here. Then we know what we have for dinner tonight. We can cook them different ways. Like boiling them or mashing them. Mr. Nishimura. Yes. We're all in the mood for fried lobsters tonight. We want fried lobsters. We want fried lobsters! Fried lobsters. Fried lobsters. It was just one year ago. Mr. Nishimura, what is a pixel? I think that it gives a clear picture. There are 400,000 pixels. Really. That will be more than enough to use in Antarctica? I would say 400,000 would be enough. I see. Ouch! Ko-kun. Ko-kun. Ahn... Open your mouth. How did you cook these fried chickens? Like I always do. Why they aren't crispy? - I don't know. - Can you make it crispy? Don't eat them, then. Did you double fry? You need to fry twice with 180 degree heat. You flied at too low temperature. It gives me indigestion. Then make your stomach strong. What's the matter, Ko? Hey, sit properly. You hurt me. - Stop talking and eat. - Eat. As you may know,... Mr. Suzuki will join as a cook for the 38th Antarctic Observation crew. Give him a big round of applause. Would you like to say a few words? Since I was small, I have placed these photos on the ceiling. I looked at it every night praying to go to Antarctica. My dream of twenty years has finally come true. Thank you, everyone! Mr. Nishimura. Congratulations, Sir. Take care of the cooking here. Yes, Sir. I will be heading to Antarctica. Let's toss him up in the air. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. That's how it is now. Mr. Nishimura, congratulations. Congratulations. - Let me talk with my family first, Sir. - Congratulations. - Sir, let me talk to my family. - Have good time at Antarctica. Let me discuss this with my family first, Sir. The lobster brains are in the tartar sauce. It looks weird. Anyway, let's eat. - Sashimi was a better choice. - Yes, I agree. FROZEN SOLID NEWSLETTER Come in. You've got a fax. Thank you. My dear honey. How are you? Our home has been very peaceful as usual. Today is Setsubun Day. Throwing beans can be very messy. I ask Yuka not to get carried away, but she will make a mess anyway.

I was walking with her during our lunch time... - Mr. Nishimura. - Yes. When I go home, I'm going to try triathlon. Triathlon? Exercise at low air pressure will train me well. You've got so much time on your hand. I feel free here. Nobody tells me what to do. Free room and board. My son won't ask me for money. I can stay here for a few more years. Oh, I see. What are you doing? Mr. Nishimura, it's hard in the core. 'Core'? In the core of the noodles. Cooking dried noodles is tough here. Is there a better way? Mr. Nishimura, it's still hard in the core. Bounce your torso, then spring up your arm and stretch out. Stretch out your arms. Red leotard today. Yes, it's red. Red is nice. Yes, I like red. It's nice. - Isn't it, Mr. Nishimura? - Oh yeah!

Swing your arms in a large motion. 351 DAYS TO HOME What day is it? Don't you remember? Is it the 4th? No, it's the 7th. It's his birthday. He should remember it. Mr. Motoyama doesn't remember his birthday and usually miss it. So, we should give him a surprise party. I'll let everyone know. You make a nice birthday meal for him. All right. - How do you feel? - It's hurt. - Does it hurt? - Ouch! Hurt? It's painful. Of course, you feel pain. Why are you smiling? A light frostbite. It takes one week to heal. One week. Are you joking? I'm serious. You'd better get a second opinion. Anyway, I'll put on some ointment. It's my fault. It's not. I'll find someone to help you. Who? I'm sorry. Forget it. Don't worry. Can I help you? Try it. It's coming up. Hold the end. Don't pull too hard. I'm pushing it out. The Ice bar drilled from 2,500 meters is called an ice core. The ice core is made of frozen snow from some 300,000 years ago. It contains a lot of information on the climate at that time. It's like time capsule. Don't touch it. If you drop it, you must pay for it. How much is it? About $100,000. One hundred thousand? - Place it at the marking of 20. - You mean 20cm? Never mind. Just put it down gently. Moto-san, would you like some snacks? No, no thanks. - By the way... - What? What would you like to have for dinner today? Anything will do. Oh, I see. Then, beef. What? Beef. How do you like it? How about a thick steak? How thick? You decide. What was that alarm? Would you like something other than steak? - Mr. Nishimura. - Yes. You know, I haven't come here just to eat. Mr. Nishimura, you can't cook with it. We don't have enough fire power. Mr. Nishimura, is this a good way to cook? Maybe. 'Maybe?' I will light it. - It's hot. - Hold it up! - It's too hot! - Bring the beef up. - What shall I do? - What do you mean? It's fun. Be careful. It's dangerous. Stay away from me. Help! Get away from me! Please! Hey, hey! What's going on? I'm sorry I've been reading a comic book. HAPPY BIRTHDAY Dad, happy birthday. Thank you. Can I speak to your mom? Yes, she is right here. Mom doesn't want to talk to you. - I see. - Why not? Wakana, how is your school? I'm going to accompany my chorus group on the piano. Wow, that's exciting! Listen to my piano playing when you come home. I'll listen to your piano all day. Shall we start? It looks so juicy and tender. Mr. Nishimura, this is Antarctica, isn't it? Let's eat. Moto-san. You look great in glasses. Moto-san. Okusan. Your wife does not want to talk to you, Moto-san. Where are my glasses? Moto-san, happy 45th birthday. Mr. Nishimura, do you have children? - What? - Children? A kernel of rice? No, it's a tooth, my daughter's tooth. Just before I came here, her tooth fell out. You are supposed to toss it away. Is it an upper or lower one? It's a lower tooth. Then, you toss it up to the roof. It's just one tooth. What about your wife? Did she consent to your coming here? My wife is totally against it each time I leave home. She threatened me with divorce if I leave home too many times. I like what I do,... which requires me to be here. I wish I could commute home from here. Moto-san. This is Antarctic, Antarctic. Hail to Aurora. Captain, yeah! Bon. Taste good? Let's play ball! I'll hit it out of here. The pitcher is intimidated. Hey, hey, hey. The pitcher is nervous. Hey, hey, hey. Hell, no! I dare you to hit it out. It's a big hit. - Be quick. - I'm trying, but I can't. CONGRATS! -70째C Don't forget camera. Two weeks later,... the Sun has gone down into the horizon of snow. The Sun disappears in June in Antarctica. It's called polar night. The station is covered in darkness all day. The Mid Winter Festival is held at all observation stations worldwide... on winter solstice day at Antarctic. THE MID WINTER FESTIVAL It's Perigord foie gras terrine with fig puree. What? Fig puree. - What's foie gras? - Goose fatty liver. - Goose what? - It's done. Please serve them. Fatty liver... - This. - Yes. Kochi sea bass poelee with balsamic sauce. Sit properly. - Bring me the mustard. - Coming up. 235 DAYS TO HOME I'm still sleepy. Let's go to sleep. OK. What time shall I call you? I don't know. I'll go to Hakone with Ayako the day after tomorrow. What? You didn't tell me that. Why? I didn't. No, you didn't, but... It'll be an expensive call for you. OK. I'll talk to you soon. Oh, no! No more ramen noodles? Many went for the noodles at night,... so we've run out of them. It's still August. No wonder, we have crabs for breakfast. Crabs, we have a lot of crabs. Can you make ramen noodles? Don't we have flour and eggs? We don't have kansui. What's 'kansui'? Are you all right? Umm... I feel dizzy. We have a lot of crabs to eat. Chief, I brought you crabs. My body aches. I feel chill. I must have caught a cold. Chief, no virus here, so you don't catch a cold. Then, it must be the flu like illness. - Shall I get some medicine? - Never mind. I'm staying in bed. I leave the crabs for you here. Yes!! You are a genius. The Chief must be playing hooky. Take it easy. If he stays like that, we all have to chip in. The drilling has been stopped. Here's a martini. He can't help being sick. I spent three years to prepare for this job. So did you, Moto-san? Each person is different. But everyone has to work. It's not fair. Yes!! You still have one left. - Yes!! - How about this? Come in. Mr. Nishimura, I can't sleep. What? I have trouble falling asleep. You'd better check with the doctor. I'm fatally in love with ramen soup. Actually it's my blood and flesh. Yes. What do I have to look forward to when I can't have my ramen soup? I just want noodles and soup. I don't need anything else in it. Just noodles and soup, you know. Hira-san. Don't touch me! Hey Chief! You must be in. If you don't come out, I'll kill you, you mophead! A life of a lonely heart I sigh out my sad life but, I must keep on living... in this lonely town. Hurting others, I shut my eyes. My tender loving words can only bring pain to people. And I... Hira-san. What are you doing? Nothing. I have craving for... butter lately. You'll become diabetic. Wait! Mr. Nishimura, the butter. Mr. Nishimura, don't take the butter from me. Help! Mr. Nishimura, the butter... What were you doing? Umm... Nothing special. How was Hakone? Just so so. What do you mean? I won a mahjong game last time. I can calculate points now. Are you listening to me? Oh, yes. What did you eat today? Umm... Tororo. I like tororo, too. It's delicious, isn't it? Why they call it tororo? You know... Um-hum. I'm seeing someone else. I'm seeing someone else. I want to go home. I want to go home. Haah... I want to hang out Shibuya. I've had enough. I'm going to die here. I'm pushing it out. What do you want to do when you return to Japan? Let me think. I know what I'll do. What'll you do? To play Beach Volleyball. Do you? It's fun playing under the glittering sun. Let's all of us get together and play it. Here comes the core. Shake the end. - Help me. - What's going on? - Are you crazy? - What the hell you are doing? - He isn't sick. - Not sick at all? You'd better explain! I'm sorry. Stay away from me! Mr. Nishimura, get him. Give me the penguin pin, penguin. Ouch! Ouch! - Be careful. - Why is he naked? Noooooo! Hey! Yukaaa! Daaaad. Supposed to toss up. Mr. Nishimura, they are really sorry. Mr. Nishimura, I'm very sorry. Very sorry. I don't see it. Maybe at the top. Wait. It's not the North Pole, is it? - Not here. - It's the opposite direction. - The opposite direction... - Go down more, down. - This way? - All the way to the bottom. At the very bottom? Is this it? - It's far away. - It's all white. Dad, can you bring me back a penguin? No penguins there. Then, a seal? No seals either. Then what lives there? Nothing live there. Yuka, when I leave home, you'll miss me, right? Not really. What are you doing? It's off. My tooth came out. My tooth... - Put it from this side. - I'm trying. Is it ready? I don't know. Ready? I guess so. You scared me. Dip it gently. Finish it up. - Doctor, can I cut it? - What? Come on in. Mr. Nishimura, we're all hungry. Let's eat. How do you like it, Mr. Nishimura? It gives me indigestion. It's not something to cry about. Hello, everyone. Hello. Members of the Dome Fuji, hello. Hello, everyone. Can you introduce yourself? My name is Keita Matsumoto, a 3rd grader. Hello everyone. Hello, Keita. My question is 'Do penguins live there?' Well, no penguins live here. We're far away from the Showa station... where the penguins live. It's the Dome Fuji. It's so cold that even penguins will freeze. Then do seals live there? No seals here either. Then what live there? Well,... we are the only living beings here. What about cute animals? Do they live there? Something wrong? No more questions. Members of the Dome, I'll switch to the next child. Yes, please. Hello, everyone. Hello. What do you eat there? - You answer. - What, me? Penguin. I'm in charge of cooking here. It's the same kind of food people eat in Japan. I heard you prepare meals for 8 people every day. Isn't it tough to do that? In the beginning, yes, but now I'm used to it. Do you feel lonely with only 8 people living there? Sometimes, but we all share the same loneliness. What's your name? Yuka. Oh, I see. I have a daughter with the same name. Really. What is your favorite food? Umm... Various kinds. Who cooks for you, your mom? Yes, but she doesn't feel well because Dad is away from us. I'm sorry to hear that. Then, can you prepare some meals for your mom? Why? You know, delicious meals make people happy. I see. I'll do that. Thank you. I'll switch to the next child. Is there anyone else for questions? Hello. What would you like? Everyone is at the bar. Give me a beer. - Stay at your room. - Shut up. Go back to your room. Here is the beer. This is a high class beer. This is an aerosonde cocktail. Forget about her. Look for someone else. Someone else? He has someone else. - Is she cute? - I only know her voice. Just her voice? - Mr. Nishimura. - Yes. I checked to see what's kansui made of. In plain language, it's an alkaline mineral water. Really? Mr. Nishimura, what is baking powder? It causes dough to expand. - It's also called sodium carbonate. - I' m sorry but I don't get it. Mix baking power with water. It releases carbon dioxide gas. When you add salt, it becomes an additive similar to kansui. It has similar chemical compounds. OK. My turn. - Yes! - Net. Where is Hira-san? In the middle of observation. Go fetch him quickly. I'll go again. Mr. Nishimura, I can't wait. Noodles will get soft. Then, let's start. Mr. Nishimura,... This is a real ramen. Roasted pork in it, too. I saw a beautiful aurora outside. I've never seen such a gorgeous one. Captain, aren't you doing the observation? - Aurora? - Aurora. Who cares. Noodles get too soft. It will get soft. Get soft. What the hell. Hello, KDD inmarsat Shimizu speaking. This is the Dome Fuji. Where are you placing a call? Well... To you. Excuse me? I want to talk with you. I miss your voice. - Good bye. - Would you marry me? - KDD inmarsat operator. - I'd like to speak to Ms. Shimizu. - Where are you placing the call? - Ms. Shimizu, please. I'd like to speak to Ms. Shimizu. She works there. Yes? Well,... I've just called and spoke to Ms. Shimizu... Good morning. Were you late last night? Yes, till late at night with the Doc. You aren't young any more. Leave me alone. Good morning. - What's going on? - He's got a stiff neck. I can't turn my neck. It's not a laughing matter. What's happened? He can't face front. I want to die. - Can you eat breakfast? - I don't know. Mr. Nishimura, I asked you to wake me up at 7:00 am. - I did. - But I wasn't up. - You went back to sleep. - You didn't do what I asked for. Just sit down. Mr. Nishimura, that's my jersey. That's my jersey. Good morning. A big shit like this came out. It can't be that big. Sit down. Good morning. Good morning. Hey, I said good morning. Take it easy. Here comes miso soup. Morning, I said. Easy. Let's eat everyone. I'm glad I can eat. What's the matter? Something wrong with his neck. - What's wrong with you? - I got a stiff neck. It's gross. You are such a simpleton. Moto-san, just let it go. Don't show that. Soy sauce, please. Don't eat while eating. - It's upside down. - I can't see. 'Don't eat while eating?' I meant 'Don't read while eating'. What's wrong with you? I even speak funny. I'm Shimizu of KDD inmarsat operator. When I have my hair cut and a clean shave, what I saw in the mirror was an ordinary man. A big change from strict water conservation and no place to go. I'm so confused. What? Nothing. Ouch! Can I change the channel? Yes, you can. The trailing pack is still going strong. They can catch up with the lead pack. Masashi Fukuda, No.1192 has broken away from the lead pack. Mr. Takigawa, this is his first try. Indeed, he is a rookie. Can he maintain this pace to the finish line? He is distancing himself from the runner up. I wonder if I had really gone to Antarctica. This is a beef teriyaki burger. This is so sticky. Don't get it on your hand. This is for Yuka. - This is for you, Ko. - Thank you. Yuka's birthday is coming up next week. She wants to hold the party at home. Her friends will join the party. - So let's make it a home party. - That's fine. Let's prepare several hors d'oeuvres. Like some chips, a few snacks, and some coke. - Yes. - Yes. Dad, can you cook for us? What? That's a great idea. You will be the cook for her party. Is it OK? Go ahead and eat. OK. Taste good!
