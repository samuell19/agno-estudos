I told you I need more hours. You only got me on the schedule three days this week. Joelle has five. What the hell, man? Joelle smiles when she comes in the door. Yeah, bet that's not all she does. Jeez. Hello? Mrs. Gilbert, pick up your daughter. - She's suspended till Thursday. - What do you mean suspended? There was an incident in the bathroom. - Did she hurt anybody? - We'll explain when you come here. - You take your medicine? - No. I don't like that stuff. It makes me sleepy. It also keeps you from lighting paper towels on fire in the girls' bathroom. What the hell were you thinking? We're gonna talk about this later. There are gonna be consequences. Not bad. ...player gets a top salary, the next player negotiates for even higher. They have to go one direction or another. You can't be half-pregnant. You've got a salary cap that you enforce, or you can just go wild. That's true. Well... - Hey, Mom. - Hey, Shannan. - Hey. - Oh, glad I finally got you. Was thinking about you. - How's it going? - You know, just another day in paradise. - What do you mean? - My boss is a total asshole. - Gave one of my shifts to the new girl. - What a dick. - Yeah. - I can find some cash if you need it. Well, that's really nice of you to offer. - I'll pay you back. - I know you will. You know, just as soon as I get on the other side of this shit. - Okay. - It's been a couple weeks. - Can I come up tomorrow night? - Yes! - Yes, you can come home tomorrow! - Awesome. - Oh, the girls will be so excited. - Me, too. Can't wait. We'll see you tomorrow, baby. - Bye. - Great. ♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪ ♪ Wake unto me ♪ ♪ Starlight and dewdrops ♪ ♪ Are waiting for thee ♪ ♪ Sounds of the rude world... ♪ - Hey. - Hey, Sherre. Shannan's coming for dinner. If you say so. ♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪ ♪ Queen of my song ♪ ♪ List' while I woo thee... ♪ Mom, did you ask her to come - or was it her idea? - No one has to ask. This is still her home. I'm still her mom and we're still her family. I'm thinking maybe we'll watch that talent show video after dinner. I think she'd get a kick out of that. What? Nothing. Why can't you be happy for once? Maybe she had to work. She worked last night. This is Shannan. I can't answer my phone now because I'm doing something way more fun. Hey, Diva. Look, I know you didn't mean it, but I think Mom's really hurt. Even though she'll never admit it. You should call her and apologize. Also, your boyfriend called. Anyway... I miss you, Diva. - Sorry about last night. - For what? Well, I know you were looking forward to Shannan coming home. It's fine. - Gonna get your butt in the shower today? - Leave me alone. - Are you sure you're okay? - For Christ's sakes! The world's not gonna end 'cause Shannan had a schedule conflict. Hello. Who? Goddamn it. Who is this? Uh, how did you get this number? Well, I don't know why you're asking me. She hasn't lived here since she's 12. So, if she owes you money, you're barking up the wrong flagpole. - Who is it? - Some doctor. What time is it? Oh, shit, I'm late. He wanted to know if I'd seen Shannan. Shannan's boyfriend called me last night, asking if I knew where she was. I thought they were just in a fight. I've tried her five times, and each time it's gone straight to voicemail. Mom. He's never called me before. I'm sure it's fine. Give it a day. She'll call. What happened to your hand? - What happened to your hand? - I burned it. It's been 48 hours. When will you start looking? For my daughter. Hello? Hello? - They hung up. - They're not even looking for her? They can't find her in the system. What about that doctor? - His number should be on the caller ID. - It came up "unknown." He said he was in Long Island. Maybe we should start calling the hospitals. There are hundreds of hospitals on Long Island. Did something happen to Shannan? A doctor on Long Island called me. I'll put her in the system, ma'am. Come on, girls. I'm sorry, but unless she's physically here with you, I can't give you any information. Nobody knows where she is, and the police haven't done a thing. Now, one way or another, I am leaving with those phone records. If you're you're not going to help me, go get me someone who will. - She has five. - Five what? Five cellphones. Mom, why would Shannan need five phones? Do you know where this boyfriend lives? Okay, so when did you last see her? So, she went to work in Long Island and never came back. Wanna know more? Ask her driver. Okay? He was the one that was supposed to bring her back. What was Shannan doing in Long Island? Selling Girl Scout cookies. What you think? Why don't you save time and tell us what you did to her? I would never hurt her. Then why'd you hit her so hard she had to have a titanium plate grafted into her jaw? You don't know shit about me, little girl. And you sure as shit don't know about Shannan. You take the money and the gifts that she buys you, and you don't think to ask where it all comes from? And when she comes home, who do you think she's coming home to? Hmm? I was always there for her. Were you? Where can I find this driver? You two wait here. Mom, I'm not letting you go in there alone. Lock the doors. We'll only be a minute. I have my phone. I'm looking for Shannan Gilbert. I'm her mother. You're Michael Pak, right? Her driver. You need to relax, lady. Where is she? We went out to Oak Beach. She went in to see a guy. Next thing, she's freaking out, okay? What happened? I'm just a driver. I don't go in. I wait in my car and then I drive her home. That's all I do. - That's all you do? - Yeah. Yeah, well, you didn't take her home. Your daughter was hysterical that night. She ran down the road, banging on the door of any house with a light on. She wasn't making any sense, she was shouting all kinds of gibberish. I tried to help her. But she wouldn't let me, so I said fuck it. Oh, fuck. Oak Beach? Way down Ocean Parkway, past Jones Beach. It's a gated community. Miles from anything. This is the last contact we had. If you live in Ellenville and your daughter lives in Jersey City, what the hell are you guys doing here in Suffolk County, hmm? Well, her phone records are full of calls from a 631 area code. Have you filed a Missing Persons report? Just phoned Jersey City, they don't have a record of it. - Mom, I don't feel so good. - Just a second. Just because she didn't come home, it doesn't mean it's a five-alarm fire now. Right? Okay. Then why was her last contact with anyone a 23-minute phone call to 911? - Hello? - Shannan, get in the car! Come on, what are you doing? Miss, I can't help if you don't tell me where you are. What's wrong? I'm having a hard time getting a read on your location. Come on, Shannan! Come back! Help me! Help! All right, um... The report says the unit arrived at 5:40. Officers interviewed several residents who said they... saw your daughter leave on her own with no sign of, um... suspicious activity. This is her jacket. Yeah, well, as far as the 911 call goes, the residents say that she was on drugs. My daughter doesn't do drugs. You got a close relationship with her, Ms. Gilbert? Excuse me? What was she doing in a gated community, 100 miles away from home in the middle of the night? Can I be frank here with you just for a minute, please? When girls like this go missing, it's a high-risk environment. You know, I mean, maybe she ran away, maybe she'll turn up. Hey. Do you think you could stop that for one second, please, sweetheart? Just one. My daughter isn't on drugs. She didn't run away. She's missing. Now, I have been hung up on, dismissed, and ignored, but one thing I won't be is silenced. Now, you say she's not missing. Fine. That's your position, but here's mine. She called for help at 4:51, and you arrived at 5:40. How in the fuck does it take an hour to respond to a call like that? Jesus. Crack a window. Ocean Parkway is shut down between Gilgo Beach and Oak Beach. Police aren't saying much, but what we do know is that a police dog picked up a scent and a canine officer, knowing there was a Missing Persons report, brought in a search team. We expect to learn more tonight when Suffolk County Police Commissioner, Richard Dormer, holds a press conference. Commissioner Dormer made news earlier this year after narrowly surviving a vote of dismissal for staffing level issues that may have contributed to the deaths of three voters. - Hey. - Hey. There's four in all. They're skeletal. They're wrapped in burlap. And they're, uh... They're spaced evenly apart. There's... one down there, here, here, and over there. If the press starts to say we got a serial killer on our hands, this will blow up. Keep this under control, Richard, or your retirement could come sooner than you planned. You got it? - Okay, sir. - All right, go handle it. Thank you. Jesus fucking Christ. Commissioner Dormer, sir, they're ready for you. - Commissioner! - Sir, over here, please. Thanks. - Sir, over here. - While searching for a missing prostitute, one of our officers has located... four bodies in an area along Ocean Parkway. Were the bodies all left there by the same person? I can't say that. This is an anomaly. There's... There's no need for panic. - That's all I have to say. Thank you. - Sir, we have one more... Ellenville Diner. Hey. I need you to cover for me tonight. - Why? What happened? - I gotta go back. Where? Long Island, for Shannan? Yeah, the police station, they found bodies. Oh, God. Do the girls know? Yeah, I'm about to tell them now. Of course. Don't worry about it. I got you. Good luck. - Okay, thanks. I owe you. - Bye. - Hey. - We gotta go back to Suffolk County. Mom, what's going on? Mom? They don't tell you that over the phone. When the units rolled up, she's a ghost. Residents seemed pretty calm about it. Everything seemed to be kosher. They figured that it was a domestic disturbance which resolved itself. - What do you know about Oak Beach? - I... I know the guys like to go to parties out there once in a while. - Why? - What kind of parties? Oh, come on, Richard, you know. Birthdays, bar mitzvahs, quinceañeras, come on. You know, come on. - You think this is some kind of joke? - No. I don't. Look... she's not in my fucking trunk. Your real problem is that one out there. She's feisty. Okay. Let me handle it. Okay, ladies, come with me, please. This way. Come on. Let's go. Mrs. Gilbert. Thank you for coming so quickly. I'm... I'm Commissioner Dormer. - I know it was a long drive... - Are any of them her? It appears not. But we are working a grid as we speak. Tomorrow morning we begin the aerial searches, first thing. That's assuming she's... You're searching everywhere, right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I wanted to ask you some questions about Shannan, if that's okay. Is there anything that you can tell me about the men in Shannan's life? She has a boyfriend, Alex Diaz. Anybody else we should be looking at? A driver. Pak. Michael Pak. What about the doctor? What doctor? He called me the morning after she went missing. He said he saw her and he helped her. He runs a home for wayward girls. What about her jacket? We have the jacket and it's being tested. Can you recall this doctor's name? Fuck. Oh. Harper? Haskell? - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - I don't remember. Mrs. Gilbert, there's a lot we don't know at the moment. Which is why it's really important that you don't talk to the media. Let us handle that. One wrong word, and they'll make a meal out of it. It's in your best interest. Sharon's, too. It's "Shannan." The beautiful beaches of Long Island, New York have become the latest backdrop in a murder mystery. The victims were engaged in a high-risk business, and these homicides appear to us to be directly related to that business. The Medical Examiner determined the cause of death for the four women to be strangulation. Each body meticulously placed in bur... 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert, a prostitute from Jersey... I wish they wouldn't call her a prostitute. Well, what do you expect them to call her, a lawyer? I always told you, girls, the choices you make eventually catch up with you. You've never said that. It sounds like you're blaming her. Maybe I should blame you for not telling me she's in an abusive relationship. Like you not telling me she was a prostitute? Why didn't you do anything? What else aren't you telling me? I was waiting in the car like usual. Uh, playing Words with Friends. And that's when the john... this fat fuck comes up to the window and he says... You gotta get her out of my house. Fucking kidding me? So, I went inside and... Shannan was behind the couch on her hands and knees, shaking. - And she called 911. - Help me! - She started screaming. - Help me! - What are you doing? Shannan! Stop! - Help! Somebody! Shannan! So then I said, "I'm trying to help you." Finally, I said "Fuck it," you know, and just drove to Oak Beach to knock on doors myself. I talked to the john. Um... Oh, I met this guy with a limp who was actually willing to help. What was the name of the john? Brewer. He must've done something to spook her. Suffolk County Police are questioning an Oak Beach resident in connection with the disappearance of Shannan Gilbert and have identified the four skeletons along Ocean Parkway as Maureen Bainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Costello, and Megan Waterman. All sex workers advertising on Craigslist who have been missing since as far back as 2007 and as recently as three months ago. Commissioner... Why are we learning about this on the goddamned Today show? What do you think? - All the other girls have one. - All the other girls are dead. Their families invited us to a vigil. - You've been talking to them? - Online. Oh, we're not going to any vigil. - Why not? - Because Shannan's not dead. - Suffolk County Police. - I'd like to speak to Commissioner Dormer. Okay, you tell him this is Mari Gilbert calling, and if I don't hear back within the hour, I'm gonna drive my car into his front fucking lawn. Okay, I'll see you at dinner. Oak Beach resident, Joseph Brewer, who hired Shannan Gilbert, has been cleared by Suffolk County Police after taking a polygraph, leaving two questions still unanswered: who is killing sex workers on Long Island, and where is Shannan Gilbert? Police have identified the remains - of the four women... - Yes, hello. It's the 20th goddamned time I've called! What are they doing to find her, and why did they let that fuck go? He hire... ...a prostitute who went missing after apparently meeting a client on Craigslist. Are dozens more murdered women dumped like trash on the same strip of beach, waiting to be uncovered? We are live at the beach-turned-burial-ground. The girls are very available. They're very vulnerable. They have no family, and there's nobody out there looking for them. What's going on, Mrs. Gilbert? Either your phone's broke or your secretary's a moron because I must have left 50 messages for you. This is my daughter, Shannan Maria Gilbert. There's one here for every day that she's missing. and I'm gonna continue posting these until you either find her or die of paper cuts. - Do not ignore me. - Nobody is ignoring you, Mrs. Gilbert. I have a talent for holding grudges and unless you help me, I'm gonna raise more hell than you can handle. And don't you ever fucking call my daughter a prostitute again! Okay, tell them we'll do the vigil, but we want to meet them first. - And make sure everybody comes. - What are you wearing? It's a long way to Oak Beach. - What were you guys talking about? - I don't know. I... work. The weather... Her and her boyfriend sneaking Taco Bell in the new Freddy movie over at the Hudson Mall. Did she say anything about going to visit her mom? Wait. Are you serious? Do you know anything about her mom? Oh, my God. These women are so pathetic. The less we say, the better. We don't need them knowing our personal business. What's that for? My notebook. I'm gonna take notes. Maybe we should go around? I'm Missy. I drove in from Connecticut for my sister, Maureen. It's so good to finally meet all of you in person. Mom. Say something. Uh, Lorraine. My daughter's Megan. I sold my TV to be here from Maine, so I have the cash to stay here until the vigil. I'm Lynn. My daughter is Melissa. This is my other daughter, Amanda. We came here from Buffalo. Oh. Kim is here. Sorry, I'm late, y'all. We were just going around introducing ourselves. Where we're from, who we've lost. Okay. Kim... North Carolina. Um... I like Rocky Road ice cream and long walks on the beach, and my sister was Amber. Did I miss anything? Wait. Are you serious? Do you know anything about her mom? 'Cause she's a real piece of work. Yeah, abandoned her own daughter when she was just a kid. Shannan was in and out of foster homes her whole life. All her mom is good for is taking her money. Doesn't even care how Shannan made it. Just as long as she shared the wealth. My daughter had three cellphones. My daughter had three cellphones. She was working on the... Craigslist. Yes, so did Maureen. So did Melissa. They all did. That's why they're all so the same, because online, you can practically go shopping. Sooner or later, they're gonna get this guy. There's gotta be some... computer trace they can do. . Mm-mm. They don't get you on email. You post a number, then they call. Which is untraceable because the girls work on burner phones. Look at you, knowing your shit. They think they're all drug addicts. - Melissa wasn't even into drugs. - Neither was Maureen. She drank. Drinking's better than drugs because it's legal. But coke is the best way to keep a call going. Make some real bank. Your girls knew that, whether you want to believe it or not. They told me Megan was where she wants to be. That, uh... That she didn't love me. As sad as it is, I feel some kind of relief. At least they're finally paying attention. Are you shitting me? If you think they give one goddamn about these girls, you're delusional. They weren't searching for them. A cop stopped along the side of the road to let his dog take a shit. He accidentally found them. What I meant was... at least it's on the news and people are aware of it. Have you watched the news? It's all, "He's a cop," "He's a clammer," he's this, he's that. It's all "him," "him," "him." What about our girls? Who's talking about them? And when they do, it's "prostitute," "hooker," "sex worker," "escort." Never "friend," "sister," "mother," "daughter." They don't care. They blame them. And it's our job, as mothers, and sisters, to make sure these girls are not forgotten. So, should we wait on the vigil? No, we're doing the vigil. We're going to Oak Beach, to their front fucking yard. Who tipped them off? This is a private community! I'll call the police! Go ahead. It'll take them an hour to get here. Speaking of which, can I borrow your phone? Sure. Why? They already know my number. There's a crazy lady about to tear through Oak Beach. Come quick. Who lives here? The son of a bitch who hired her. Mom? Mom. Twelve minutes. Now we both you know you can show up on time and your secretary's not a retard. Can we just go back to my office and talk about this? We'll talk right here. This is a... This is a private community. Well, then why don't you arrest me? Listen, I came here to do you a favor. I don't want to see you hauled away in handcuffs. Don't you understand that when the uniforms get here, - they're gonna cite you for trespassing. - Okay, let me get this straight. My daughter calls for help but it takes you an hour to get here, but the Stepford Wives call you and you show up in less time than it takes to make a sandwich! Whatever it is that you're looking for, Mrs. Gilbert, it is not here. Okay, then why did my 14-year-old just find her sister's earring outside the home of the man that you just set free? Shannan went screaming through here at 4:51 in the morning, and no one helped her. Where is the outrage? Where's the concern? Four dead bodies show up in my neighborhood, I'd be shouting from the rooftops to get to the bottom of it. What are they hiding? What are you hiding, Mrs. Gilbert? You never told me that Shannan grew up in foster care. You never told me you nearly got shit-canned for mismanaging your department. Keep up the good work, Commissioner. Fuck's sake. I wrote down every house number and license plate I saw. We need to talk to these people and these people. They might've seen her. No one's gonna talk 'cause they want us out. These guys are looking out for each other. They all have friends in Suffolk PD. The police said everybody passed lie detector tests. Yeah, but anybody can pass a lie detector test if all they ask you is "What's your name, and your favorite color?" It sounds like Shannan's running from her driver. You can hear him in the 911 call. That makes no sense. I don't care how fucked up I am, my ass is going to that driver because he's my way out. He's my safety. That's what you pay him for. Well, maybe he was mad she didn't pay him. Why would she all of a sudden not pay her driver? Maybe because she was bringing money home. Okay, do you don't know she didn't pay him. You're just guessing. Well, I'm assuming. She's probably forced to get stoned, drunk, high... - Not forced. - Okay, whatever. I'm just saying, I've lived it. Well, I'm just saying, you're not Shannan. Mari, I feel for you... more than I feel for myself or any of the other ladies here, because Shannan's still missing. And knowing is better than not knowing. But you don't really think that... I'm just saying it might be good to accept that there's another ending to all this. What's that ending, if you know so goddamned much? Hello? Is this Mari Gilbert? Yes. My name's Joe Scalise. I have some information you're gonna want to hear. I'm a neighbor of Joe Brewer, the john. I got your number from one of those fliers you posted. Suffolk PD don't return my calls no more. You're gonna learn that the good people of Oak Beach, if they live by one thing, it's this: be wary of those who would... who would ruin a very good thing. You are, madam, the wayfarer they've been dreading. I didn't know Shannan was a prostitute. I didn't know she was bringing home money. She doesn't let anyone help her. I thought we were doing this together. So fucking annoying. Sorry. We weren't following you. We kind of were. What are you two talking about? Families. Yeah. Tell me something nice about Shannan. She graduated high school two years early. She was smart. And she was the first one in our family to go to college. I called her "Diva." Because she's such a little diva. Amber stood 4'11" and weighed 100 pounds soaking wet. Her legs looked like little chicken drumsticks. I spoke to her the day she went missing. We were in a fight. You're walking through what used to be the killer's dumping ground. He only moved the bodies to the road because this whole area is set to be drained as part of the mosquito project. That means people poking around, seeing things they shouldn't. Here. Look. This is where he keeps his supplies. But... where? Go, go, go. - Shit like that happens. - What's up? Oh, God. Easy. Just... Joe Brewer didn't kill Shannan. He may be a sociopath, but he's not the psychopath. That honor goes to Peter Hackett. Dr. Hackett? Look, I know you and your buddies don't give a shit. Don't worry. You're not gonna have to put up with me much longer. But for the moment, this is my case. Okay? - I want a suspect. I want a name. - Okay. Peter Hackett. Dr. Peter Hackett. He lives in Oak Beach. It's nice to see you again, Ms. Gilbert. I saw spools of burlap in a shed by his house. Come on. What are you talking about? Every clammer, contractor, landscaper - has got burlap by his house. Come on. - But a doctor? I tell you what, why don't you let the policemen do the police work, honey? - Why don't you suck my dick? - Classy. This is the guy who called me the morning after she disappeared. He said that he helped her. Come on. Aren't you gonna write it down? Are you fucking kidding me? Hmm? Write it down. What? I said write it down. I googled Sarra's medication. So I know it's a mood stabilizer. She told me you took her to a psychiatrist. Why didn't you tell me? There's nothing to tell. It takes six weeks for the medication to have any effect, so we'll know more then. Hello. Can I help you? Peter Hackett's the best neighbor you can have. Ever there's a problem, he's always the first one to call. Do you remember anything from that night? Yeah, that girl was pretty well drugged up. - What? - She couldn't hardly stand. - Excuse me? - She almost fell down twice - when I was talking to her. - Wait, you saw her? - Why didn't you call the police? - I did. - What was she saying? - It wasn't making sense. "Help me. Help me. They're going to kill me." So I sat her down on the porch, and I said, "Relax." I told her that I called the police and they were on their way. As soon as I said that, she ran. Anyhow... - What? - ...she fell down the stairs and... she ran that way. Wait, do those security cameras work? Is this where they keep the security footage? Are you from the news? We, unfortunately, don't have it from that night. It gets taped over automatically. It runs on a loop. I'm sorry. But the police got a copy, right? We found it odd they never asked. I'm sorry, who are you? Why didn't you give it to them? Why don't I get my husband? He oversees all that. I just came by to drop off his lunch. How can I help you? Dr. Peter Hackett. My wife tells me you're a reporter. I've lived here for 30 years. There's not a thing I don't know about Oak Beach. We're like a miniature government here, and I pound the gavel. Barbara, why don't you put on some coffee? It's on, dear. Then why don't you refresh it? I, uh... recognize you from the news. I'm so sorry. What happened? Well, that's the $64,000 question. But you called me. I beg your pardon? Unit report to mile marker 10.46, Ocean Parkway for possible remains sighting. Just arriving. Going to check it out. Stand by. We got a 10-54 on Ocean Parkway near Cedar Beach. Fuck. Last place Shannan was seen was in clear view of a video camera, and Hackett's in charge of the footage! Okay. I'll look into it. He erased it. What? Did you find something? Mrs. Gilbert, you really shouldn't be here. - Can you take her to the road? - What did you find? Let go of me. What's in the bag? This one's not like the other four. Those were in the bramble a mile away. There's no burlap on this one, either, or hyoid bones. Any indication of a jaw plate? No, sir. Right. Let's go. Two dozen police recruits expanded the search for bodies today from the thicket to the beach. Suffolk County Police also expanded the total search area. This platoon of recruits conducted a grid-pattern search on Cedar Beach. It's between Gilgo and Oak Beach, where the previous bodies were found. Since last year, the search has been hampered by the harsh conditions in the thicket. Hard, wiry brush called Virginia Weepers and Bittersweet so thick, you cannot see a person or dog just ten feet away. Dr. Peter Hackett. Kim's working again. "Carolina" is her street name. She posted this an hour ago. Oh, Kim. What is she thinking? I'm a busy guy. I make and take a lot of calls. But how would I call a woman I don't even know? I'm a doctor... not a magician. She said that... that you told her that you helped her daughter. I hope she doesn't blame herself for the life her daughter led. But... apples don't fall far from the tree. Am I right? So, what do you remember from that night? I think that's when Barbara and I were in Florida. - Oh. - You ever been marlin fishing? But you were here. Because when the daughter's boyfriend came the next morning to look for her, didn't you offer to help search for her? Florida might have been... - the week before. - Oh, okay. That's right. I saw this kid tooling around, and he told me his story and I couldn't turn him away. That's what we do around here, we help people. With all due respect, Dr. Hackett, you're living in a gated community with a sign that says: "Be nice or leave." I don't know that that sends that particular message. Look... the police came. They said everything was kosher. Right. But... why didn't you show them the security footage? Why didn't they ask for it? This is not my investigation, kemosabe. You're the head honcho. Maybe you ought to teach your cops better. A girl goes missing and you have a tape. Are you telling me that you didn't at least watch it? That would be tampering with evidence. Am I right? Peter Hackett is a self-important blowhard. The very fact that he's not leading the charge in this is all the evidence you need to point a finger. Okay, if that's true, why wasn't Shannan found with the other girls? 'Cause the attack on her didn't go as planned. She'd gone off running. People had seen her. The police came. It just became too risky. He tells people that he runs a home for wayward girls. That he rehabs them. That he saves them. What he really means is he buries them. He's got an examination table in his living room. And his "home for wayward girls" is really just code for "graveyard." Then where is Shannan? In his backyard. The marsh. It's the one place they haven't searched. We found another one. Pieces, dismembered. Forensics says it matches a pair of severed legs found in a plastic bag in '96. - '96? - Yeah, '96. Are you telling me that somebody's been dumping bodies in Ocean Parkway for 15 fucking years? Well... it looks like it. Hey, what is this? Shannan Gilbert's medical records? Come on, seriously? You really think you're gonna find any answers in these medical records? Look, if she was still around, we would have found her by now. I mean, honestly, who spends this much time looking for a missing hooker? If you're here to give me some big speech, save it. I already heard it from the others. Kim, I know you're strong, and you think you can handle whatever comes your way, but... this is just plain stupid. Everyone has their destiny. Maybe Amber's was Amber's, and maybe this is mine. You don't really believe that. You're only doing this because deep down, you think that's all you're worth, but that's not true. You tell that to Shannan? I got Amber into this, you know? You tried, Mari. - Here. - Thank you. Lynn's boyfriend knew a guy. We're all wearing them to the vigil. - Turn on the TV. - Why? ...there's also no evidence to suggest that it's the work of a single killer. Although Shannan GIlbert coincidentally went missing at the same time in the same place, she doesn't fit the victim profile. She was the only one who didn't come to Oak Beach alone because she had a driver. Oh, God. We will continue to look for her, but... until we find evidence of foul play, Miss Gilbert will no longer be considered a part of this larger case. Commissioner... - That's all for the moment. - Fuck! Yeah, this is Mari Gilbert... Hey, you okay? They stopped looking for Shannan. They're not looking for her anymore. - It's okay. - What are we gonna do? - Hey. - Why did they... That's why we're here. Okay? Yeah, right. You're okay. I'll just be a minute. How can you say Shannan's not connected? She was last seen three miles from the other girls. She was in her 20s, just like them. She was small, just like them. She was on Craigslist, just like them. None of those other girls would've been found if it wasn't for her. It doesn't mean that we're gonna stop looking for her. - Mom! Mom! - What about Hackett? Even if he did call you, it... it's not evidence of guilt. Lying about it is. I understand that you're angry, Mrs. Gilbert, but... a policeman deals in evidence, not anger. Ha, ha! What fortune cookie did you read that in? Mom, hurry. They're waiting. Give me a minute! You have no idea, you know, no clue what worry really is. We have Shannan's medical records. Yeah? What do they say? I'll tell you what they don't say. They don't say how she used to shove her fingers down her throat and puke until her mouth bled. They don't say how she ran out into the snow one night with no clothes on and nearly froze half to death while I was out working graveyards and doubles just to keep the lights on. Yeah. Look, Mari, I know that you gave her away to foster care, and I know you think it's your responsibility to bring her home again. But this isn't on you. I'm her mother. It's all on me. You gave her away? Oh, for fuck's sake, Sherre, can we not do this right now? You lied to me. I didn't lie. You told me the state took her. What was I supposed to say? "Mommy gave your sister away because she couldn't get her the help she needed." Do you think I wanted that for Shannan? Do you think I didn't try to do everything in my power to get her the help she needed? Shannan was bipolar. She was a mess. I took her to doctors I couldn't afford who gave her drugs that she wouldn't take that had side-effects that I couldn't stand to watch. I was just a kid. What she needed was love. It was the only thing she ever wanted her whole... fucking life. Okay, but how do you know what she felt? Because I feel it too, Mom. Shannan may be gone but I'm still here. I'm still here. Oh, my God. These fucking women, they've brainwashed you. You wanna know why they're so dead set on this vigil? It's their way of denying what god-awful mothers and sisters they were. They've convinced you that we are like them, but we are not, honey. We are nothing like them. You're right. No, we're not like them at all. They're a family. I wish they were my family. Okay. Well, maybe your new family will pay for your college because I sure as shit can't afford it. Are you gonna give away Sarra next?

But you're an asshole people listen to. And if they don't, you make 'em. I don't got what you got. Neither does she, or her, or any of us.

From Oak Beach. Dr. Hackett put his house up for sale. Well, great. Call Robin Leach. His car is already packed. He's gonna disappear. If you ever want to talk to him, this could be your last chance. You wanna talk? Talk. You've already upended my life. You're implying I chased after this girl. I can't catch up to myself walking backwards. - Yes, but... - When I was young, I was... stranded on a skiff... in the water... in the dark. I was all alone and scared I was... gonna die. Then I saw this boat. It was far away, but... I sent up a flare, and they came to save me. The next day, I enrolled in emergency medicine. Ever since, my specialty has been... saving lives. If she's out there, we gotta find her. You're the real hero. A mother who would go to any lengths for her daughter. That is true heroism. Oh. Mrs. Gilbert. Nice to see you again. Don't worry. I left my staple gun at home. So how did you get in my office? It's not your office anymore. True. True. Yeah, they're putting me out to pasture, as they say. What do you think you'll be most remembered for? What can I help you with? Why haven't you searched the marsh? It's the only place in Oak Beach you haven't searched. Because a grown man can't get through there, never mind a 100-pound girl. Yeah, but it borders Anchor Way where Shannan was last seen, and Larboard Court where Peter Hackett lives. Ah, so this is about Hackett. We've already cleared him. What... You gotta talk to Joe Scalise. Joe Scalise is a paranoid conspiracy freak. He and Hackett hate each other. Some dispute they had years ago over land. He wants to bury Hackett. Maybe he's giving you the shovel. What about her jacket? If Hackett had contact with Shannan, her jacket would prove it. It would have skin cells or fibers on it or something. We don't have the jacket. When they first picked it up, Shannan wasn't officially missing and it got lost. What is this, some kind of cover-up or just incompetence? Search the marsh or I'm going on the news. A year ago, the police first discovered the remains of three bodies dumped along the side of the road off Ocean Park... - What's happening? - They're draining the marsh, looking for that hooker. Mari! Lorraine. - What are you doing here? - I came for the anniversary vigil. The others are on their way. Hey, don't worry. We're not gonna let you go through this alone. All right? Heavy equipment, including a backhoe, were brought in to dig through the thick brush and marsh. The commissioner says the area was too tough for the searchers to get through on foot. Here in Oak Beach, missing sex worker, Shannan Gilbert, was last seen alive leaving a client's house. During the search for Shannan Gilbert last year, four other bodies were discovered. There are now ten sets of remains, half of whom are still unidentified. According to the police, Shannan Gilbert's disappearance is unrelated to those. We believe that Shannan Gilbert ran into that area the night she disappeared. She's in there someplace, and we're going to do everything we can to find her. Thanks, Missy. Yeah, I owe you. Okay, see you soon. Missy's gonna pick up the girls on her way. Your hands are shaking. They say not knowing is worse than knowing, but I'm not so sure. And if they find her, I know she's gone, but I'll still be angry. And if they don't find her, I have hope. Yeah, but you're still angry. How do I get rid of the anger? Well, you stop blaming yourself. It's not your fault. Yeah? - I think we got something! - What do you got down there? - Get a camera down here! - Rope this off right now! - Over there. - We gonna need a cradle? What did they find? - I'll call you back. - Show me! No... - Let her through. - Get the fuck out of my way! - What did they find? - Let her through. What's over there? What's over there? What is it? Tell me right now, goddamn it! What did you find? Please! Officer. Hey... I'm sorry. I'm gonna take you home. As much as today is about Shannan, it's not just about Shannan. It's about all of us... every one of us and our friends and family that were affected by this. The police failed us. They failed every one of our girls. They failed to keep them safe when they were at risk. They failed to take their disappearances seriously, and they failed to go after the people who took advantage of our girls. Some of them may even be those people. And they ignored me, just like they ignored Shannan the night she called for help and waited an hour for them to arrive. Why are our girls to blame at the exclusion of everybody else? It's time for accountability, and I'm starting with myself. Let's go home. This is why we're here. This is my daughter, Shannan. And she won't be forgotten. She never will be forgotten. And we are gonna continue to fight as long as we need to... until... justice is done for our daughter. ♪ Morning calls with whispers in my ears ♪ ♪ I believe the spirit is near ♪ ♪ Days go quiet and disappear ♪ ♪ Darkness knows the truth, I fear ♪ ♪ God knows I've tried to stay strong ♪ ♪ I swear to God, I swear in vain ♪ ♪ Been raging and angry for so long ♪ ♪ Alone with all my pain ♪ ♪ Only to give you a sweet beginning ♪ ♪ But no matter how hard I try ♪ ♪ I find myself on the losing end ♪ ♪ Of all the trouble I'd in life ♪ ♪ You are missing, I am haunted ♪ ♪ You're broken, but I am fearless ♪ ♪ Are you listening?
