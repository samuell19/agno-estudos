Besides, it's not a real girls' night out, Unless one of us drunk-stumbles home into a bush. - Finally. (chuckles) Come on. - New plan.

You, you, you keep looking for something you love doing, And if you do that, you'll never work a day in your life. But, you know, they do leave out the part Where you accumulate massive amount of debt And zero health insurance along the way.

(chuckles) are you kidding me? - [Naomi] but I get thirsty. - Ridiculous. - What happens when you wake up thirsty? (Willa grunts) (creaking) - What was that? - Big house, makes lots of noise. I'm used to it. Will you stay until I fall asleep? - Only 'cause I like you. (Naomi chuckles) - I like you, too. Promise me you'll keep looking. - Looking for what? - For the thing that makes you sublimely happy. - I'm not sure that exists. You'll find it. I found mine, once. - What happened? - Same thing that always happens. There's something I need to tell you. (car alarm wails) - (sighs) oh, god. I'm sorry, I think that's mine.

Willa. - The back door was open. - What? - When I came inside, the back door was open. - We'll look into it. Why don't you go home and get some sleep? We'll be in touch if we have any more questions. - Thank you. Let's go home. Come on. - So what do you think? (knocks) - Hey. - Hey. How's she doing? - She hasn't moved in a half an hour. Come in. (eerie music) (door closes) (dramatic music from tv) - [anchor] we come to you with an exclusive this morning As news breaks that a two-year-old girl was abducted From her home in cobra county last night. Investigators say the young girl was- - Brought you the good kind. Not the crappy rub-your-nose-till-its-raw kind. Made that mistake last night. - Have you heard from Trent? - His plane landed this morning. He's been at the police station ever since. - Is that normal? - Nothing about this is normal. - The body of popular youtuber Briana Diaz, Who achieved viral success with her "get organized" videos Remains to be found. Authorities are asking for anyone in the community With any information on this case to please come forward. Kpil news. Back to you. - I guess suicide isn't as sexy as murder. - "go home for the holidays," they said. "it'll be fun," they said. - Just like doesn't feel real. You know, that she's gone. - It will. - Willa. Hey, Willa! (ominous music) I didn't do it. (Willa breathes heavily) (brooding music) (car door slams) (door opens) - Hey. (Willa gasps) Don't do that. - What do you say we get outta here And go see a movie or something? Sorry, honey. Are you okay? (suspenseful music) (trunk door slams) - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just Not really in a movie mood right now, if that's all right. - There's a new museum that I thought that we could, uh- - I'm good. - There's a showing later on today. (chuckles) okay. I can cancel. No big deal. - Where are you moving? - With Darcy. She has a condo on cradle lake. Three bedrooms. It's big. It's nice. She's nice. I really think you'd like her. - Is that why you never mentioned her? - I tried. But you barely answered my calls in the last two years. - We text all the time, like... I mean, here and there. - I really don't think that's the kind of thing To text about. - Just feels like a weird thing to hide. - Well, there's pictures of us all over social media. Nobody's hiding but you. I'll be downstairs, if you need anything. (door closes) - What're you up to, Trent Adler? (birds tweet) (lock clicks) (door closes) (keys clink) He didn't see you. (sighs) god. There's no way you saw you. (doorbell rings) (gasps) (suspenseful music) - Whoa. Didn't mean to scare you. Uh, you must be Willa. I'm Trent, Naomi's husband. Sure wish we were meeting under different circumstances. - Me, too. - I'm really sorry you had to see all that. Crime scene photos are a big part Of being a defense attorney, But I'm sure it's not a sight you'll be able to forget for- - Ever. - Right. Did she say anything before it happened? - Not really. - Nothing about her or- - Or who? Or you? - I knew she was unhappy. I just... You never imagine the person you love Is capable of something like that. - What if she wasn't? - Wasn't what? - Capable. What if somebody else was in the house with us that night? - Someone, besides you? - We heard a noise. - What kind of noise? - In the attic, creaking. Like the floorboards or something. - Did you go to the police? - Not yet, but the back door was open, When I came inside the house, somebody could've came in. - Oh, it does that. The door. Sometimes it's not fully shut. The air pressure from the front door Causes the back to open, it happens. - Okay, well that doesn't explain the creaking. - I'm sure it was just the house settling. - What if she really didn't do it? - Then she wouldn't really be dead. - She just didn't seem like the suicidal type. - People aren't always what they seem. - Okay, well, I'll let you know if I remember anything else. - Before you go, you wouldn't happen to know Where Naomi's cell phone is, would you? - It's missing. - Wouldn't be the first time She lost it after a night of drinking. I just thought I'd ask. (phone vibrates) Oh, I should take this. It was nice meeting you. (door slams) (brooding music) (seatbelt clicks) (car starts) (Willa sighs) - That explains that. Never having kids. (muffled music) What kind of husband comes home After his wife just kills herself And he starts browsing the mail? - One that's not eager to go back inside. - You know who he reminds me of? Like a yuppie psycho from one of those movies. Cold, materialistic, conceited. Secretly kills people. - Seriously? - What? - I mean, don't get me wrong. He can be rude sometimes. And he's definitely lost a sensitivity chip, but a murderer? Come on. - People aren't always what they seem. Dude said so himself. - Didn't the cops say that he had an airtight alibi, though? - Yeah, but it doesn't mean he couldn't have hired somebody. - True. Did he ask you if you'd seen her phone? - Yeah, he did. - That's weird, right? - No, I just think that he was trying to figure out What type of head space she was in. - Yeah, maybe. Or maybe there's something incriminating on it. - Are you trying to start a podcast or something? (chuckles) - I need to think about these things! 'cause if I don't think about these things, Then I think about my things and I'm actually Really trying to avoid spiraling at the moment. - Well, I think that's a requirement Of coming home for the holidays, but- - Distraction, my friend, is the key to happiness. - I don't necessarily agree with that. I think happiness is when you let go Of the things that are holding you back. - You know, isn't this the same shopping center That your dad used to have that restaurant in? - Same shopping center, same storefront. - I'm guessing that wasn't a coincidence. - Yeah, well, when the bank seized this place, I knew I wanted it someday. Less pad Thai this time around, but, Same last name on the lease. - He must be really proud. - I'm gonna make you a goodie bag. - Oh no, no, you don't need to do that. - Oh, your skin's gonna thank me later. - Emmett! Willa? Hello? (keys clink) Hm. (suspenseful music) - Here it is! (chuckles) - oh. - How's your dad holding up? - What do you mean? - Him and Naomi were close. - They were? Like, close how? - Like he would go over there often, When Trent was out of town. He'd help Naomi with household things. You know, she always used to say that your father Was more of a husband to her then Trent ever was, And that would drive Trent crazy. (chuckles) He never mentioned that to you? (suspenseful music) - God! (laughs) oh, god! You scared me to death. - What you doing? - Nothing, I just, I didn't know if you were in there or- - I've just finished. - Oh, well, great. Perfect timing. (chuckles) - guess what? - What? - I made dinner reservations at Henry's. - Oh, aren't you fancy-schmancy? - I'm a fancy-schmancy kinda guy. - Let's go. - Okay. So how was your day? - It was good. - Yeah? - It was busy... (peaceful guitar music) - [Willa] oh, thank you. - Willa? Hey. - Milo. - Hey. Oh, my god. Wow. Holy moly, it's been a long time. And I can't believe I just said "holy moly". - No judgment, I promise. - So how long have you in town? - Just until after the holidays. - Oh, that's great. You know, I did some it stuff for your dad over the summer And he said that you were starting To get your real estate license. I love houses. You know, real estate porn, yes, please. Sign me up for, you know, all the homes. (chuckles) - Yeah, I mean, I was doing it, But I kind of changed my mind last second. - Oh, yeah. Oh, that's that's cool. I get that. One time, I stood in line For 12 and a half hours to get a video game I realized I didn't actually give a crap about Until like the minute it was time for me to buy it. And I was like, is this really worth a bladder infection? (chuckles) and it, uh, well, it wasn't. So, I just walked away. (Willa laughs) yeah. Oh, but I'm fine now. I mean, my bladder's fine. Infection free. - [Willa] that's good. Yeah. - Can you tell I only talk to the children? 'cause I can. Oh, I'm a teacher now. I teach kids. That's what I meant when I said... This was significantly awkward. - No, no, it was, um- - Painful? - A little bit. But it was also kinda nice. - Yeah, it was, wasn't it? - Yeah, I um, I gotta go. I think you're up, though. - Yeah, ah- - It's good seeing you. - You too, yeah. - Let's catch up some time. - Definitely. I could give you my... I could give you my, uh... (car door closes) (car starts) and that tracks. I promise I'm not a virgin. (brooding music) (Willa sighs) (car door slams) (suspenseful music) (window scrapes) (bauble cracks) (ominous tones) (suspenseful music) (door opens) (ladders creak) - God! I'd buy that. He's home. - I don't care what his attorney thinks of me. This is not a popularity contest. No, I was paid to do a job and to the best of my abilities. That's what I'm doing. (suspenseful music) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I know, I know. Do we have an understanding? Good. Yeah. Yeah, fine. Okay. I'm gonna call you back. (bauble clacks) (ladders squeak) (suspenseful music) (door closes) (tense percussive music) - (gasps) the hell is that? (Trent breathes heavily) (door slams) - [Darcy] did you also get my favorite dessert? - Oh, you know I did. (Willa pants) - [Darcy] hi. - We brought home some cheese ravioli with meat sauce. You still eat meat sauce, right? - I told him, text and ask first, but he didn't. - I got it on the side, just in case. - Why didn't you tell me you were close with Naomi? - I wouldn't say we're close. - Well, Tia says that Naomi used to joke That you were like a second husband. - (chuckles) second husband? Second dad, maybe, but husband? (scoffs) I used to do work around the house When Trent was away. He asked me to. That's how this all started. - Well, why didn't you say anything? - I didn't think it was relevant. (Willa sighs) - Well, you're friends with him, too? - Barely know the guy. - Did she ever talk about him? - Wait. What's going on here? (Willa sighs) - I don't think that Naomi killed herself. - What? - I think that somebody broke into her house And saw that I was there and took a baseball And threw it up my car so that my alarm would go off. - Why would you think that? - Because my back window was broken And I found a baseball on the floor and it's the same Exact kind that Trent has in their attic. Somebody saw that I was in the house and needed me out So that they could kill her. - How do you know what's in their attic? - Well, why does that even matter? - You broke in, didn't you? - Do not make this about something that it's not, dad. - Willa! - He's hiding something. I know it. - You're not a kid anymore. You can't just break into people's houses. - This is nothing like before, dad! Somebody killed my friend, and I know it! - Willa, she wasn't a happy person. - Yeah. Well, who is? (footsteps recede) (Emmett scoffs) (eerie music) - Dead girl sandwich. So who are we avoiding today, the ghost of Christmas past, Or the ghost of Christmas present? - You're not real. - Oh, yeah. No kidding. Dad's mad. - He'll get over it. - Why didn't you ever tell me you broke into houses? - It was just a couple times after my mom died. Turns out rebellious teen wasn't really my vibe. - That and commitment. I didn't kill myself. - I know. - Then what are you waiting for? - [Tia] looks like he's headed upstairs. - [Willa] I'm crossing the street now. - I know. I'm literally like watching you do it. And remind me again why I have to be the lookout? - [Willa] gotta protect our generation's Next great girl boss, remember? (Tia chuckles) - [Tia] oh, he's in his bedroom. - [Willa] okay. Oh, gosh. Okay. I'm going in. - (chuckles) godspeed. - Okay. - [Tia] what exactly are you trying to find? - I don't know. But if Trent or whoever killed Naomi came under here After the cops arrived, then maybe left something behind? - Only to find that they've been overtaken By a giant family of brown recluses. - You know, why don't you see the stand-up routine For when I'm not fighting off a panic attack? - [Tia] forgive me for trying to have a little fun. - Wait. I think I found something. - What? (distorted chatter) A soul patch? - No, a soft patch. Like loose dirt? I think there's something buried under here. - I didn't hear what you're saying. I think you're breaking up. - [Willa] you're breaking up, you're breaking up. Tia! - Can you hear me? - [Willa] Tia, can you hear me? - Willa? How about now?

(Tia screams) Shh! - It's fine. I don't think he heard us. He's upstairs. He's upstairs. It's fine. We're fine. - It's an earring. - So you think it's Naomi's? - Something tells me she didn't spend A whole lot of time down here. - Yeah. (muffled clunks) (Willa and Tia gasp) - Is he coming out here? Is he coming? Okay, we have to go. - Go, go, go, go. - [Tia] oh, my god. (pants) - What? What, what, what, what? It's Naomi's phone. - That doesn't make any sense. - It's dead.

He has a gun. - Who has a gun? - That would be me, officer. I'm the one that called you. These can broke into my house And I was lawfully defending my property and my life. - Ask him what's buried under his house. - What? - He killed his wife and he hid something, Maybe evidence under there, go take a look. - I have no idea what she's talking about, officer. - He's lying. There is a cardboard box buried under there. - It's true. We saw it. - You mind if we take a look? - Be my guest. (brooding music) - Stop worrying. It's gonna be fine. - You don't know that. (door opens) (door closes) - You don't remember me, do you? Well, you're in luck. Mr. Adler has agreed not to press charges. - What about the box? - Dog bones. Probably from the previous owners. I suggest you two Leave the police work to the professionals. - She didn't kill herself. I know that. - Stay in your lane, beck. - Hey. Hey. Are you really gonna let some old rivalry Stop you from solving a homicide? - Takes two to have a rivalry. - Oh, right! So I'm guessing all those tears after I kicked your butt at The state championship were because you were happy for me? - You were better than me. I can admit that. But look at you now. Not doing so hot, are you? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - There is hotel surveillance footage of Trent Adler, Two states away, 20 minutes before she died. Whatever you think happened in that house, he didn't do it. - He could've hired someone. - You need to let this go. - That's not gonna happen. - You don't get it, do you? You're the last person on earth who wants this To turn into a murder investigation. - And why is that? - Because the only other person inside that house The night she died, Was you. (dark music) - It's okay. - [Willa] I can't. (door closes) (katz sighs) - Let's keep a patrol unit out front for the night. Make sure she doesn't try anything else. - You got it. (katz sighs) (suspenseful music) - Gotta get that phone. - Got room for one more? - It's your house. (Emmett sighs) Remember when we used to come out here And watch for shooting stars? - Yeah. - I miss it. I missed you. I guess the elf gig at the restaurant didn't work out. - No, I got fired for crying too much. - Well, you always get extra emotional this time of year. - It was her favorite. - It was yours, too. For a while. I know Trent's not acting the way you think he should be. Grief affects people differently. I chose anger, at the world. At your mother. Society tells us that we shouldn't be grieving. So you feel that you can't talk about it. You feel alone. Afraid. So you withdraw and you put up walls And every day, those walls get a little higher. - It's not your fault that I made the choices I did. Dad? Will you just make sure to keep climbing those walls? - Oh, you better believe it. Hah! Shooting star. - You're a liar. (Emmett laughs) (phone alarm rings) (phone alarm rings) (sighs and groans) (phone alarm rings) (tense music) (gasps) - Sorry, sorry. (chuckles) I didn't mean to scare you, again. - What are you doing here? - Can I just come in for a minute? - You know, now is actually really not a good time. - I'm sorry about overreacting the other night, and look, I get it, you don't like me. I'm sort of used to it. Comes with the job. People see a nice suit and a flashy car and they think- - Was there something that you needed? - You're not the only person having a hard time Wrapping their head around all this. I don't blame you for wanting what happened to be untrue. I wish it was. But right now, I need to trust What the professionals are telling me, Or else how the hell am I supposed to ever heal? - You're right. I'm sorry. - Don't be. Like I said, I get it. (sighs) It's nice to know she had such good friends. Guess I'd better get back to it. - Sounds good. - See you around. Uh... You were headed out? - Yeah, yeah. Right, um, I was just... It's mail. I was just getting the mail, so... - Take care. - Mm-hm, you too. (suspenseful music) Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. (sighs) Passcode. (sighs) Obviously. Tia, come on, just think about it. You guys are practically sisters. You don't remember her passcode? - What part of "leave the police work to us" Did you not understand? - Uh, the part that I didn't agree with? - If anyone figured out what we did last night, I would be hemorrhaging customers. - Tia. Nobody is going to find out. There's no way he's gonna talk! It'll just make him look guilty. - I believe that you believe that, And I really want to believe what you believe, Like with every fiber in my being, But I need to focus on these orders. I'm trying to mourn my best friend. This place is all that I have! This place is all that my family has And you just need to let me focus. Just let me focus, please. - Yeah, no. Um... Of course. - Thank you. (somber music) - Absolutely loving this new concealer from montage beauty. My skin feels fantastic. I'm such a fan.

Let me go! (screams) (grunting) (gasps) (brooding music) (Willa sighs) (knocks) - Enter! (door creaks) - I thought I might find you here. - Hey, Willa. - Hi. I'm sorry. I know this is like totally weird of me. - It's okay. I like weird. You know, like, like good-weird, Not like living-in-your-mom's-basement weird. Like the right amount of weird, you know? Quirky, really. Anyways, you were saying? - Is there any way that you can hack into a phone? - Whose phone is it? - Naomi Adler's. But it's for a good reason, I think. I hope. - Yeah, um, okay. Sure. - Really? - On one condition. - I can't believe they're allowed to still serve this. - (chuckles) hey, come on. It's a rite of passage. Straight to clogged arteries and possibly diabetes. - You know, I used to eat lunch in here, Whenever musical theater would rehearse. Watch Naomi boss people around. - It's great that you guys got to stay so close, After all these years. - We didn't really, actually. I mean, not for lack of trying on her part, But when I left, I didn't really take a rear view mirror. - I mean, I get that. When I left for Palo Alto, I couldn't say goodbye fast enough. - Can I ask a personal question? - Boxers or briefs? - Oh, obviously. Briefs, with prints. - Oh! - Yeah. (Willa giggles) (brooding music) - Hi. Everything okay? - Do you have a moment to talk? - Yeah, of course. Why? What's wrong? - We're not releasing this information to the public yet, But Naomi's death is no longer being considered a suicide. The medical examiner found evidence Conclusive to a homicide. - Oh, my god. - Why did you come back? Why Edgewater? Why here? (scoffs) - You ever feel like your brain is stuck In the wrong place, in the wrong time? Like, no matter how far you run, Or how many new people you surround yourself with, You're always still living in the shadow of your past. - Yeah, I mean, I thought that's how all brains work. - Like I thought I wanted a big city and a big life, But it turns out all I was doing was searching For the exact opposite of what I had here, Which turns out, ironically, is pretty great. I get this surge of happiness every time I help a kid Overcome the same challenges I faced when I was their age. It's healing. It makes me stronger. - (chuckles) well, you're definitely stronger than I am. - Okay. You won the state taekwondo championship, Three years in a row for Edgewater in high school. You are definitely the stronger one in this, uh... This, whatever this is. - Cheers. (suspenseful music) (both chuckle) - We don't have any suspects yet, but we're looking. So if anything, or any one comes to mind, Even if it doesn't seem relevant, I want you to give me a call, okay? In my experience, there's always someone who knows More than they're letting on. - I'm probably gonna regret this. (sighs) I don't know if you'd consider this to be relevant. - I'm gonna need you to send me these right away. (keyboard clacks) (gentle piano music) - Don't you need to like plug her phone in or something? - No. Remote hacking is very real and very scary thing. You just have to, uh, know what you're doing. Well... Okay, there you go. Text, photos, emails. You want me to send you the link? - You're the best. I'm sorry. (giggles) - It's good, uh... Cool. - Hey, guys! I'm so excited for you to meet my new best friend! - Hey, guys! - Briana Diaz! What are you here to do for me today? - Today, I'm going to organize Naomi's pantry. - She's about to change my life, And she's kind of a big deal. I don't know if you know much about her, But she's kinda famous. (knocks) - Hey. Your dad said you used to be quite the athlete. - Yeah. I used to be a lot of things. - My nephew is taking a karate course at his high school And apparently, they're looking for a new coach, So, if you want it, I could put in a good word for you. - I don't. But thanks. - Well, you must really miss it though, right? - I miss my mother more. (door closes) (sighs) (somber music) - I'm sorry, I... (sighs) (door closes) (sighs) - [Naomi] seriously, my pantry... I just want to stand here for hours and look at it. Like, look at all my animal crackers. My snacks, my pasta! - There's gotta be something here. - [Naomi] Briana, take a bow. (Briana laughs) Look at you. Ladies and gentlemen, the woman of the hour. (knocks) (door opens) - Hey. Dinner's ready kiddo. - I'll be right there. - Okay. (door closes) - I do not know where I put the keys, honey. I don't know. - Well, you'd forget your hands, if they weren't attached. - I resemble that remark. (Emmett chuckles) - Speaking of missing things, that missing girl Briana Diaz. Did either of you know her? - No, I didn't. But it's so sad. I mean, they still haven't found her body. - Yeah. No, it's really awful. What about you? - Did I? - Know her? - The missing girl? No. No idea. Can't imagine what her parents are going through, though. - Yeah, no, just I know that Naomi did like organizing work For her so I just wasn't sure if maybe your paths crossed. - Nope. (Willa chuckles) (water splashes) (muffled electric saw whines) (suspenseful music) (muffled hammering thuds) (muffled electric saw whines) (Willa sighs) - Well, your guess is as good as mine. I have no idea what he's doing in there. I'm still trying to figure him out. (chuckles) - Me too. - So I don't know if your dad told you or not, but, I was married before, to a not-so-great guy. I mean, I thought he was great, but, My mom said I was never really a good judge of character. "you always see what you want to see." (chuckles) That's what she said. Anyway, it took me a really long time To learn to trust again, and it's been two years And I still get butterflies when I'm around him. Your dad, not my ex. Sorry. (chuckles) (muffled electric saw whines) Is that silly? - Uh, no. Whatever, whatever makes you happy, I guess. - Um, maybe we could be friends. I mean, it's probably gonna take a really long time, But maybe... Maybe someday. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'd like that. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - I need to finish the dishes. - Oh, yeah, yeah, go! Go, go do the dishes. Thank you for doing the dishes. (suspenseful music) (door opens) (door closes) (keys clink) (lock clicks) (door closes) (switch clicks) (suspenseful music) (keys clink) (muffled footsteps) (Willa gasps) (keys clink) - Got ya! (Willa gasps) (intense music) (Willa screams) (groans) (Willa gasps) (Willa pants) (door slams) (Willa pants) Willa! Hey, what's going on? - You lied about knowing her! - Knowing who? - Briana! I saw you in a video with her and Naomi. - Look, I can explain that. (Willa gasps) - Did you kill them? - What? What are you talking about? Of course not. Willa. (knocks) open the door, right now! - You're lying! - Look, I am your father! I would never lie to you. Willa, open the door! (muffled sirens wail) Willa! Open the door. Willa! - Hey, look, you- - are you listening to me? You're making a huge mistake! You realize I'm an attorney, don't you? You think I'm gonna let this slide? No, sir. (Willa gasps) (car door slams) (Willa breathes heavily) - Dad? (door opens) (door closes) - Good evening. Sorry for the disturbance. Willa around? (door opens) (door closes) It looks like I owe you an apology. I don't know if you've seen these. (Willa gasps) (dark music) - [Willa] that's Trent and Briana. - We've got him. (Willa gasps) - Dad, I'm so sorry. - The arrest of the suspect, Trent Adler, Who we learned earlier today was having an affair With missing persons Briana Diaz. We believe Adler killed Diaz late in the hours On December 2nd and later staged his wife's suicide When she became suspicious. Our search for Diaz's remains continues, But we have found what we believe to be the murder weapon, Hidden inside the suspect's attic. - I hired Briana to help me design this, Before she went missing. Darcy's always wanted a closet and, uh, I wanted to finish this before Christmas. If I said I knew her, Darcy would've asked me how. Would've ruined the surprise and... Clearly it's not done, but do you think she's gonna like it? - I think she's gonna love it, dad. - (sighs) thank you. - I love you. - I love you. It's so good to have you home. (water splashes) - I think they found the murder weapon. - Well, um... - [reporter] hidden a chest discovered by police, Tucked inside the attic was a nutcracker With the victim's dna, but so far, No dna from potential suspects. - I guess you're right about the whole psycho thing. - It was planted. - What? - Somebody put that there. I searched that entire box the day after she died. I think I would've noticed the bloody nutcracker. - He probably moved it around like a million times. Can you imagine how paranoid he must've been? - Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. - [Tia] I'm always right. (Willa sighs) (ominous music) (thud) (eerie music) - Tia. (Tia chuckles) Tia. What is this? - I have a present for you. It's in front of you. (giggles) no, he's not dead. Yet. - Tia, what's happening? - What's happening is your deranged boyfriend over there Is going to take your life, and his own. Motive? Unrequited love. (chuckles) I mean, it happens all the time. Everybody knows he's been obsessed with you since, like, I don't know, before you were born? Sick creep. - What are you talking about? - Senior year, wasn't he voted most likely To murder someone before his 30th birthday? (giggles) it was bound to happen at some point. - Tia. Why are you doing this? You are being insane. - Yeah, I'm not really in a reflective Type of mood right now. Believe it or not, I'm not necessarily happy With how everything unfolded. So let's just skip the part where I tell you my master plan Long enough for someone to come and save you And let's just chalk it up to a really bad domino effect? (chuckles) yeah. - You were sleeping with Trent, weren't you? - You really want the story, don't you? Fine. (sighs) here's the Cliff notes. Naomi knew Trent was cheating. Okay, the only question was who. So, we followed Trent to Brianna's house, and bam, (chuckles) they're doing you-know-what, all over the place. But Naomi ran back to the car crying. I took pictures because, a, brilliant, B, blackmail. - Blackmail for Trent? - Blackmail for Briana! God, you're obsessed with him! You know what? And you're annoying. You've always been annoying. Anyways, cut to a week later, Homegirl here has a marketing stroke of genius, Because I'm brilliant, And I asked Brianna if she would review montage bar beauty. And she said yes, and then for a totally unrelated reason, She like broke out and got like a rash or whatever. - My skin feels like sandpaper, like- - God dang, dude! You're so annoying! Like, actually, when you speak, it hurts. - Don't talk to me that way! I literally have like pimples everywhere And it's literally because of your product. - Which had absolutely nothing to do with my makeup. Like, like zero. (chuckles) And then like, she's like, she calls me on the phone. She's like, "my followers deserve my truth." And I'm like, "okay, so then tell them the truth." "this is my truth!" (chuckles) I mean, honestly. I told her, "we are both businesswomen here, okay? Can you just wait until after Christmas? Because I already have over 100 orders." Okay? That's totally reasonable, right? Yeah, it's reasonable. Yes, yes, I agree. And she refused. She refused, so I visited her And I whipped out the photo and I said, "I don't know how your predominantly-housewife suburban demo Would feel about you being a home-wrecker." (chuckles) She did not take that well. So she yelled at me, I yelled at her, and then... She pushed me first, and then I pushed her, And let's just say the nutcracker thing was a self-defense. - She attacked you? - She attacked my business, okay? That's not only attacking me, It's attacking my entire family. - I don't really think that's how self-defense works, Tia. - You're getting caught up in the details. - [Willa] what is that? - Your ultimate demise? (chuckles) (muffled scraping) (suspenseful music) (Willa breathes heavily) To be continued. Don't make a sound. (keys clink) Hi! (chuckles) hey, hey. Sorry. - [Willa] god. (breathes heavily) (suspenseful music) (grunts) - What's your name again? Nevermind. Okay, listen. I know we're not supposed to be here, but um, It's our anniversary and we actually met here At Edgewater high, can you believe that? So I just, I had this amazing night planned out for us, But, um, find it in your heart to let us stay... Yeah, I mean, it just feels like yesterday, right? Huh? You have not aged at all. (chuckles) (Willa pants) - Milo. Milo, come on, wake up. - Okay, I know you don't remember me, But I remember you and I want you to know that I always Thought that you never got the credit that you deserved. Okay? And it's... Okay. (giggles) Well, um, you just have a good rest of your day, okay? (ominous tones) (door closes) (suspenseful music) Willa! (chuckles) Willa, where are you going? I'm not gonna hurt ya. Willa! Oh, Willa! (chuckles) seriously? You practically begged me to confess my long list of crimes And now you're just gonna walk out halfway through? I mean, how rude are you? (chuckles) (gun fires) (chuckles) You know there's only one way out of here, right? Okay, where was I? Uh, yes. If everybody just wasn't so obsessed About what happened to her, Then I wouldn't have had to blame Naomi. And if you weren't in the house at the time, then I would've Had time to write that stupid suicide letter. Maybe I would've written something like, "hey, Briana, I'm sorry. (grunts and yelps) (thud) (gun fires) (laughs) Looks like someone got their fight back, huh? And if you wouldn't have run up the stairs, Like a speedy gazelle, forcing me out of the window, Spending half of the night underneath the house... Thank you, by the way. (thuds) (groans) (pants) (chuckles) (pants) And after I figured out That the cops ruled Naomi's death a homicide, I knew I had to go back to my original plan, Which was framing someone! And me, being the amazing friend I am, I decided to pick Trent! (chuckles) (tense music) - Locker rooms. Man down. Gutierrez, check him out. Hammonds, you're with me. - [Tia] any questions? (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (thud) - [Willa] don't get up. (Tia pants) (grunting) (thud) (body clunks) (Tia pants) (pants) (keys clink) (somber music) - Police! You okay? Looks like you handled this. Get her cuffed. (brooding music) - Hey. The last truck just pulled out. - You know... I spent last two years searching for something That made me feel half the joy that I felt When I was training with mom. All this time I was so scared to do it, to fight, because, I was just so terrified that I would see her face again And hear her voice. Just feel that pain. The irony being that when I was forced to fight, This time for my life, I... (sighs) I did see her face. And I heard her voice. But it wasn't pain I felt at all, it was... It was love. But it was mom. In a way that I thought I lost forever. (chuckles) - She was just waiting for you to come home. - Yeah. (upbeat electronic music) - Hey, coach! Usual spot? - Oh, thank you. - Yeah? All right. (somber electronic music)
