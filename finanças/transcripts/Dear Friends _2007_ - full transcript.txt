But Rina's still in hospital. What's wrong with her? I don't know. It's been a while. Get me a drink. Are you OK? You're not high, are you? Just get me a drink. OK. Emi... Rina! Are you OK? Any cool guys here? Uh, tonight, well... Well, if it isn't Rina! Boy, you've changed! Changed? Me? Looked in a mirror lately? You look like an old lady. Here you go. What's that for?! Rina! What?! You don't look too good. Maybe you should go home. Let's do it. You wanted to. What's going on? Tonight you can. Rina! Rina! Talk to me! Are you OK? Rina, wake up! Someone! Help! Someone! You haven't eaten? You've got to eat, you know. Rina? If this is what happens... ...I don't want to be cured. Kanae! Hi, Maki. Would you mind? Excuse us... Excuse us... Matron... Did Kanae get out of the Bio-Clean Ward? Yes. Good! Rina'll be happy. Are you all right? You're in Rina's room every day. I'm fine. But Rina's refusing treatment. You're more worried about her than about yourself. Well... Rina's my friend. Matron... ...what can I do? Is there anything? It all depends on the person. Sometimes a little girl like Kanae will fight it like anything... Look, I can walk, I said! It's all right. Where are we going? It's all right. Kanae? I brought a friend. Hi, Rina. You... Sis... ...I might not get better. You'll die? I think so. But... I've fought and fought... ...but I don't think it's working. Don't die, OK? You and me, we're more than friends. We're comrades. Sis! If you die, I'll get scared. So... Yeah. OK. I'll keep fighting. All done? You've eaten everything! You want to get better now... Aw, shuddup. Some things don't change. Hello, Kanae! Hello. Hi, Rina! Rina, you know what? Kanae's getting out. Yeah? You're better? Uh, yeah. They'll do the rest at another hospital. Another hospital? Look! I drew it how Mom said. Nice, clean air, and a beautiful view of the sea. That's what Mom said. Rina, come and visit when you get better. Uh, sure. You come too, Maki. That sounds like fun! We'll play in the water. Yay! But first we'll have a colored ice! An ice? An ice! And then... Rina, let's all have an ice. Yeah, for sure. Then we'll look for seashells... ...and build a sand-castle. Thanks for everything. See you, Maki. Take care of Rina. Bye-bye. Tell me... ...why are you always coming here and doing stuff like that? Because we're friends. That again? Since when are we friends? You don't remember? Not at all. You heard the music box? Music box? That? I forgot all about it. That was yours, you know. You might not remember. We were in the same class in primary school. And once you had a birthday party... Happy birthday, Rina! I was really happy... ...that I was able to be there. But my family didn't have any money... ...so I couldn't buy you a present. You came... What are you hiding? Uh... a present. Give it here. Come on... What's that? She found it! Yuck! How's that? That's so cute! That's great, Rina! I thought that was so nice... Here you go! Here's the cake! Bye-bye. Come again! Thanks! Aren't you going, too? Yes. This music box sounds really nice. Music box? See? We still have that? It sounds nice. It makes you brave. You take it, then. Why? 'Why'? We're friends. 'We're friends.' When you said that... ...I was really happy. What you said then has always kept me going. So when I got down... ...I'd always listen to it. So that's why... ...you come and see me. That's right. When I heard you were sick, I figured it was my turn. But... that was years ago. I've forgotten all about it. You can quit coming. But I want to. Come in. Thank you. She seems to be more positive about this now. I've got you to thank for that. Sit down... Her friend Maki's been a tower of strength, too. Oh yes, Maki! We're lucky she's around. I'm glad a girl like my daughter has a friend. Excuse me. I've asked you here to talk about your daughter's condition. Yes. The swelling's gone down... I'm told she's improving... The swelling is down... ...but there's another problem. Look there. Can you see that white shadow? Hello. Can I get by? Excuse me. This looks good! Who gave us that? Remember that girl Kanae? Her mother sent it to say thank you. Oh, that girl... No luck with her, huh? The bone-marrow transplant didn't work. They knew that when she left. And that girl of yours, Rina! Boy, does she have an attitude! Not even a thank you! How do you stand her? Well, considering what's going on with her... What happened? The breast? Keep your voice down! All of it? Probably. Serves her right! Don't talk like that. Ms Takahashi! Sorry! Ms Takahashi! Matron! Ms Takahashi just overheard us about her breast! Where is she? She ran off somewhere! Go find her mother! Yes. Rina! What are you doing? Maki... Don't be stupid! It's all over. Rina! Stay back! I don't know what you heard, but you can be cured! Don't lie! Kanae died, didn't she. The doctor'll operate, and you'll be fine! Yeah, without a breast. What's the point? Stay back. Rina... ...don't die! Please! If you die... I... ...I can't live! What, 'because we're friends'? You don't know how it feels! Did you ever lose a breast?! OK. I'll... feel the same pain as you. Maki! Maki! Maki! Don't die, Rina! I don't want... ...to lose a friend! Maki! I... I... I'm the kind of person who always got picked on. Time and time again I've wanted to die... But then I'd think of you... ...and want to live. Kanae was the same. She said you made her brave. I never did anything... Yeah, but... I don't think I'll be coming back. So you help Rina, OK? OK. Promise? I promise. I promised Kanae. Why did you two do that? What did I ever do for you? Why? Because we're friends. So... ...go for it, Rina. Rina Takahashi, 17. She's in your hands. She's in your hands. Rina, good luck. They're starting... She'll be fine, won't she. Sure she will. She wants to fight now. Because of you. I didn't do anything. Maki, it's good to be concerned about a friend... ...but you've got to think of yourself, too. I've talked to the doctor. You can't go much longer as an out-patient. Has it gone that far? I'm afraid so. All right. I'll go with what you decide. I'll get started on the paperwork, then. Matron... Don't breathe a word to Rina about my illness. One, two, three! Thank you. It'd gone further than I thought. I had to take the entire breast. But it doesn't seem to have spread anywhere else. At this rate, she should be out in a few weeks. Thank you very much. All the best. Rina? Rina? 'At first I thought you were just one of lots of girls. 'But for some reason you're really on my mind. 'When I get back to Japan... '... I'm going to hit on you... ' 'Hit on you'! 'So try and make yourself more worth it by then. 'Yousuke.' What is this?! Yousuke left it with Keigo. I said I'd visit Rina, so Keigo gave it to me. But this is a love letter! Rina's so amazing! Hey... ...where's that girl gone? 'That girl'? Maki. They said she's not healed up yet, so she can't come around. Oh. I'd better get off to work. Oh, and your father... He's out of town a lot these days, and working late... He's sorry he hasn't visited you. Who cares about him? 'll see you next time. Hi, Rina! How are you? What are you doing here? Well, Hiroko... ...wanted to see how the old club queen was doing. A get-well gift. Hospitals are so awful! Dark, and smelly. That suits you now, though. Go away. Is that how you talk to friends who've come to visit you? We're not friends now. So what are friends? Once you told me that friends... ...are people you can use. And you're not much use to anyone right now. Go away, I said. Don't worry, I'm going. There's just one thing... I did it with Yousuke. A threesome with Emi. It was great. Wasn't it? Huh? Uh, yeah... Great. He said he hated stuck-up chicks like you. Bye. Let's go. Did you see her face? She is so over! You're going home. Thank you for everything. Rina... ...I know it's hard now, but time heals all wounds. Maki had to do something, so she can't be here. She asked me to tell you to stay well. Thank you. Thank you. I'll put your things here. About your room... I was afraid you might be angry, but it needed cleaning... ...so I tidied up. That's OK. Hey! Where's Maki? She hasn't been here in ages. Why not? I don't know. Sorry. I'll be late for class. Rina! Welcome back! Rina! You're back! I'm sorry about coming and saying all those things. But Hiroko insisted! How's she doing? She's gotten into drugs... You're the real queen of this club anyway. Here From me, to celebrate the return of the queen. Thanks. Hey, that's Yousuke! He got back yesterday. Where was he? Didn't you get his letter? I gave it to Hiroko. Didn't I, Emi. Uh, I'm just going to the washroom... Hiroko didn't give it to you. What letter? To make a long story short, Yousuke's in love with you. Yo! Come and dance. I don't feel like it. After I played this song for you... You've changed somehow. Yeah? Well, I was in hospital a while... It's not that. I don't know... you seem more laid-back somehow. I want to be with you. Not just for sex. To be my girlfriend. No way, huh? Why? Why do you want me to be your girlfriend? My face? My body? No answer, huh? I guess I'm right. Stupid! I'm just surprised to hear you talk like a girl. Let's say my face got all messed up... in a car accident. What would you do? Would you leave me? I'd stay with you, of course. What if I lost my legs in an accident? I'd carry you. You would? Yep. Can I believe that? Thank you. No! Again? I don't mean that. I'll take my own clothes off. OK. Yousuke... You know I was sick... You saw me, all thin, with my hair falling out... Yeah. But that's over, isn't it? Yeah, but... ...I lost one of my breasts. What? I made up my mind I'd never sleep with a guy again. But then you said that stuff just now... So... So... Sorry. How... ...am I supposed to... ...live like this? With a body like this? Never making love... Never being loved... How do I live with this body?! Maki! Maki! Maki! Where are you, Maki?! I can't go on! Rina! I thought you'd be here. Your mother phoned. She was worried. Rina, even if life gets hard, you don't throw it away. The day's sure to come when you'll be glad you didn't. No one needs me. There's no point. That's not true! Your mother needs you, and your friend Maki... Maki? Maki... She just pitied me. Don't be silly! She worries about you all the time! That's a lie. No, it isn't! She thought about you before anything else. Then why? Why doesn't she come see me? Maki? Maki! I'm sorry. She insisted she had to talk to Rina. Rina... Maki? What's wrong? Maki has a disease... ...that starts with the fingers and hands... ...and then gradually paralyzes the whole body. That's why she's always been coming here. Rina... ...listen. Maki! No. Maki! Maki! It's... It's hard... living with... a body... ...that's not right. I know how you'd want to die. That's why... ...I kept... slashing my wrists. But... ...I want... to live. It's only... ...because... ...I'm alive... It's because I'm alive... ...that I made a friend... like you. Isn't that so? Isn't it?! Maki! Maki! That's a nice breeze. About what I was telling you the other day... The Matron got a nursing school to send me an application. It looks pretty hard... ...but I guess I'll manage, huh? What's that look for? I know. You don't think I can! I'll be fine. Don't you worry. I'm going to be your nurse someday. So you have to stay well till I qualify as one. Promise. Thank... you. Don't say that! After all... ...we're friends. Rina... ...being a friend... ...having a friend... ...is fantastic. Maki's diary ends here. I've continued it since then. The pump? Hold on a second. Maki can no longer walk or speak. But I understand her. By watching her eyes... ...I know exactly what she wants. You want to go out... Takashi, come back here! You have to take your medicine! No! I was sick once, too. I told you about my scar... You old bitch! You little brat! These kids now have no manners at all! 'Old bitch', he called me! You're laughing, aren't you. You're awful! Yeah, I'm a few years older... 'Grown up', I prefer to call it. There Let's change those sheets, too. Hang on. Is it true? Do I really understand what she's thinking? Does Maki really want to go on living the way she is now? Maki? Maki! She's fibrillating. Ablation. Come on, Maki! Maki! But then I always remember... what she said. 'Because I'm alive I made a friend like you.' The words she said to me. Three months later... ...Maki's strength gave out and she left this life. Subtitles by LeapinLar
