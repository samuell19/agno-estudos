"Going through my scrapbook the other night .." "I suddenly realized it's been nearly 15 years since Prohibition took a powder." "Those were the days of Steve Maddux." "A guy you probably don't even remember." "He was like a lot of other big-time operators." "Trying to cash in on the quick money and the bright lights .." "Of what they now refer to as the good old days." "Yeah, the night Prohibition ended was sure the biggest night of Steve's life." "I remember like yesterday .." "When his girl Georgia King and I drove back to the newspaper office." "There was a story to write." "And for a lot of reasons." "I wanted to be the guy to write it." We have Broadway and Madhouse in the first edition. Orderly people don't make news. It's the disorderly ones. Do you want me to give you their names? Here you are, sir. Here is your top line for the midnight. Briggs. Get me a full column of background material, plenty of color. Let it run. Get out everything on Steve Maddux and Georgia King. There's a lot on both. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And I want every scrap there is. Well, what are waiting for? We just had a bulletin that Steve Maddux .. Yeah, I know. Hiya Rod, Mrs Flannery. Glad you came. - Nice to be here. Nice to see you, Frankie. - You too. Anything you folks don't see, just holler for it. Tonight is New Year's Eve and we got to celebrate right. Carl. Everything alright? - Everything is great, Joe. Has that brother of mine come in yet? No, what's the matter? Is Georgia still nervous because he isn't around? Like a cat in a dog pound. That's no way for her to act. This is a big night. You don't argue with emotions. You're right, she's wrong. That's the way she feels. You wanted me around when you opened your first place, didn't you. You said it brought you luck. - Yes. And it did. Well, she wants Steve around for the same reason. She happens to love the guy. Like you used to love me. Remember? Only I'm so busy I forget sometimes, huh? Hello Bernie? Is my brother Steve there? He ain't been here, Mrs Marino. Try Hooper's Building Academy. Number: State 4-1-4-3. Big Richard from Boston. - Yeah. That's a tough one, Maddux. - Not for me. Okay, gentlemen. Here they come right back at you. Read them and weep. The hard way too. - That does it. Shoot the 200. All or any part of it. Well gentlemen, I guess that winds things up. Wait a minute, chum. You're faded. Yeah? Show color. You got good connections. A half hour ago you were clean. Never mind that. How you want it? Straight roll or high dice? Straight roll. Your marbles. You tired of rolling? No. The boys need a little change of scenery. Feel like doubling your bet? Make it easy on yourself. Fifty more? You got a lot of confidence in those dice. Don't you? Be seven. Seven! Just a minute, sucker. When you switch dice, you lose. Meaning what? This. Two dice to many. Hey, I'm getting that dope back, see. You cleaned me once tonight .. You're lucky I don't kick your teeth in. Here is a message from Garcia. Stay lucky. Hey Steve. It's for you. Want it? - From who? - Your sister. Okay. Look. The gentleman is conversing with his sister. Don't interrupt. Bad manners. Who are you? - His governess. Since when? Since now. Kiss her for me and tell her I love her. No, wait. Tell her I'll come right over and do the kissing myself. You waiting for somebody? Okay, you two got me road-blocked for now. Now what you need is a lawyer. Yeah. Maybe that's not a bad idea. Goodnight, gentlemen. Thanks for everything. I never bought you any drinks. Why did you step in and take that hand for me? You like to play winners. I like to play winners. Something tells me you're a winner. I got instincts. I thought you worked for Big Mac. - I did. Until tonight. He's a big-shot. I'm just small time. You'll grow. I told you. I got instincts, Mr Maddux. The name is Steve. It's Mr Maddux to me. It was nice, wasn't it. Well, that was only the end of pasta before the main dish. And here she is again. Your favorite and mine. Georgia King. "Give me something to remember you by." "When you are far away from me." "Some little something meaning love cannot die." "No matter where you chance to be." "I will pray for you." "Night and day for you." "It will see me through." "Like a charm." "Until your return." "So give me something to remember you by." "When you are far away from me." "You are leaving me and I will try to face the world .. alone." "What will be will be, but time cannot erase the love." "We've known." "Let me but have a token .." "Through which your love is spoken." "You are leaving me but it will say .." "You are my own." "Oh, give me something to remember .." "You by .." "When you are far away .." "From me dear." "Some little something." "Meaning love cannot die." "No matter where you chance to be." "Though I'll pray for you." "Night and day for you." "It will see me through." "Like a charm." "Until your returning." "So." "Give me something to .." "Remember you by." "When you are .." "Far away." "From me." Yours? Naturally. "Oh I'll miss you." "So .. give me something." "To remember you by." "When you are so .." "Far away." "From." "Me." Like her? She'll look nice in mink, Mr Maddux. A friend of yours? He's a guy with instincts. He thinks I'm lucky. Tell him to go away. I want to talk to you. I can take a hint. Did you find a job yet? A fellah can't get any place by working. But he can by gambling, I suppose? Cut it out, Ruby. Are you my mother or my sister? Well somebody has got to bend your ears back once in a while. Why? I know what you've been doing nights. Joe told me. Joe talks too much. He thinks you're a smart guy. So do I. But I don't think you're smart enough to keep out of trouble. Is the lecture over? If it is, I have a date with Georgia. You had one about four hours ago which you didn't keep. I had to get rich quick first. What's the hurry? I want my hunk of the 20th century right now. I'm tired of standing on the outside looking in .. While the heels of the world gorge themselves. I can do anything they can, and better. Alright. Mr young-man-in-a-hurry. Look, Ruby. I love you. You're my loveliest, my best. My only sister. Who doesn't believe a word you're saying. Thanks for the waltz. Hello, girls. [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] Hello Steve. Get lost? No. Ruby decided to read me lecture number 48. What have you go to say to me? Whoa. Watch what you are doing. Alright. I will. That's not what I meant. I prefer it to what you meant. You know, a girl can get into a lot of trouble kissing like that. I'll take the chance. Where have you been all evening? - Making expenses. That's not bad, huh? Good stuff. Take a look at this. There it is. My chance to get in a New York show. When did all this happen? Well, you know some people turn up even if you don't. He caught the first show tonight. Come here. Look at me. I'm kissing a star. Like it? - Yep. You know. I doubt I'll go to New York after all. - Because it means you're leaving me? I wish you'd quit reading my mind. If you'd read mine, you'd know I'm going with you. I've got to get out of town. - You're in a jam? You mean this? No, this is nice, clean dice money. That kind never lasts long. Oh it does if you figure the law of averages better than the next fellow. I still don't like it. Okay, baby. Send me an autographed picture from Broadway. Oh wait, Steve. - For what? Lecture number 49? When I was walking around with holes in my shoes did anyone ask me what or when? No. I was a sweet guy. Now, as I'm able to rub a nickel against a dime to grab a start on something .. I get it from the only people I care anything about. First it's Ruby and now it's you. What do you mean a "start on something"? Something new. Something different from all this. You working around in a honky-tonk and me banging my head against a wall. This is no kind of life for us. But Steve, what can we ..? - We can go big-time. This is our lucky night. You have clicked and so have I. From now on, we'll do all the things we really wanted to do. You mean, marriage included? Why not? I'm a gambler. You're on in three minutes. And off in five. Look, I'll hop up to Joe's office and make train reservations for two, right. Steve .. who do you think loves you? I'd never guess. Hello, hello. Try to hurry that Florida call will you, operator. Put down the phone. I must make a call. Sit down and relax. I'm trying to call Mama. I always do it on New Year's eve. Yeah? Yeah, I gave you the number. You're a fat sentimentalist, Joe. A little friendliness don't hurt in this world. She's lonely down there. Okay? Leave that phone clear. I just wanted to call the railroad station. After I speak to Mama. I'm taking your prima-donna to New York, Joe. New York, huh? I heard you made a killing tonight. How about paying up some of the little IOUs you've got accumulated here? Don't shove me, Joe. I'm going to need every penny. It's okay. I've carried Ruby's brother so long I might as well carry him a little longer. I also heard that you got tangled up with Bender. Look out for him. He's a bad .. Hello, Bender. Bring your lawyer with you? - Yeah, yeah. Pretty good mouthpiece too. Makes nice speeches. Short. To the point. Look fellahs, let's not have trouble. - There ain't going to be no trouble. Turn around. Mug. That's a nice little bill collector you got. Never mind the fancy talk. Hand over that cash you copped. It's all this desk. I paid back some debts I owed to Joe. Yeah, but you just said .. - That's alright, Joe. This is a more urgent debt. I pay you back later. Never mind that. I'll get it myself. Sure. It's right in the top drawer. [ Telephone ] Answer your phone. The trouble is over. - Well, get him out of here. Hello? Hello, Mama. How are you? Yeah, this is Joey. Steve, look out! Yeah. Happy New Year. Sure. I'm still here, Mama. It's just a lot of fun-makers popping balloons. We're all having a lot of fun. A lot of fun. Don't look, honey. Come over and sit down. Who is here? Everyone is here. Steve and Georgia. And a Mr Bender. Well baby, I guess that spoils our honeymoon for a little while. Is this the "fresh start" you promised me? Look. You drive a car and a guy throws himself in front of you. What do you do? - I don't know. It was self-defence. He drew on me first. Happy new year to you, Mama. Goodbye. Go on to New York. I'll join you when all this blows over. And the police? It's the only way, Georgia. Believe me. You'll be alright, won't you, Steve? It's about time you asked me that. You'd better go on. You've got a lot of packing to do. Happy New Year. Suicide? Come on in, "delayed action". You're late but you got the job anyway. Get rid of the garbage. That's my line, Mr Maddux. Remember, Ruby don't need to know about this. Nobody needs to know about this, Joe. Place your bets, please. Place your bets. All your bets. Thirteen. Odd. Black. You did alright tonight, Mr Maddux. - I do alright every night. Hit me. Again. Nineteen. - Pay me. Nice seeing your sister again, Mr Maddux. Nice to see anyone when you're in the chips. Here you are, Mr Maddux. Your design turned into a beautiful bracelet. Mighty pretty. Airmail it special delivery to Miss Georgia King .. Biltmore Theater, right off Broadway in New York. It's beautiful. Yes, it is nice isn't it. That guy can pick my jewellery any day of the week. There's a thing about a diamond bracelet that makes a man very attractive. Ready, Miss King? In a minute. Just got to fix one hook. - Well, hurry it up. Hiya, Mr Corwin. Hi Willy, how are the kids? - Fine, thanks. Thanks for the plug in the column this morning, Don. My please, Tommy. - You're a sweetheart. Sweetheart. Awfully good to her mother. - Hello, Don. Well if it isn't my favorite producer. - How's my favorite columnist? I'll ask him. Grab a seat out front. We're having a run-through. Thanks. I want you to meet Bill Fellows, detective first class. How do you do. - How do you do. Bill's switched to the Broadway detail. Better be good to him. In show business, you must please everyone. The press, the police, the cast, the stage-hands. Even your backers. Say. This isn't a pinch, is it? - Not unless we see something pretty. And I think we do. Well, I'd better have a look at those new lyrics. - Okay. Is something or is something? And wait until you hear her sing. Come on, let's get started. Exactly my idea. - Easy, Don. Play hard to get for a change. Can I help it if I'm a pushover for class? Ah .. he said her name was ..? - He didn't say. But it's "Georgia King". How did you know? A friend of hers involved in a little case of sudden death. Which might turn out to be murder. Stop talking like a cop. Where does she come in? A guy named Bender was knocked off. We think. By a guy named Maddux. We think. In the club where she was singing. We know. That's the trouble with cops. You think too much and know too little. Don't move too fast, Don. That dame could be dynamite. You're telling me. She's already spoken for, to put it quaintly. Yeah? By whom? The guy with that handy gun. I wouldn't mess around with his girl. I can't think of a nicer way to die. Thanks a lot, Eddie. - Sure. Miss King. Your producer was going to introduce us. I'm Don Corwin of The Star. The columnist? She reads me. - Do you mind? Not if you're impressed enough to have dinner with me after rehearsal. Uhuh. I've been warned. - What, about dinner? About strange men. Now, if you excuse me .. - But .. You didn't say where you'd like to go. Look. I have to be back here by eight tonight. We've got another rehearsal. By eight tonight, you'll be the toast of the town. That's moving fast. - It's an old habit of mine. Well, I'd be the last one to change your habits. Who knows? You might be the first. Why good evening, Mr Fellows. You're looking right smart. I wish I could say the same for you. Oh Miss King! "The girl with stars in her eyes, Georgia King .. " "Will start some fires on Broadway when Bob Fordham unveils his new musical." That's my baby. Always well out in front of the pack. I hear nobody had sash weights tied to you since you came down here. I made out. Why so bashful about running 4Gs up to 55? Who told you that? Oh words gets around. Candy gave me the exact figures. Hey! What's got into you? That will stitch up your mouth. The next time you open it for anything but candy I'll slap the taste out. Now beat it. Did I hear somebody get slapped? You had no call to slug the kid. If you don't mind I'll handle this my own way. He only told Joe because he was proud of you. Well this will fix it so he'll stay proud. Some guys are like women. Slap 'em down and they love you more. Do you mean your purposely did that? - Oh, forget it. Want to sit in on a poker game tonight, Joe? And lose my money? Why don't you get educated? Lesson number in the first reader is all gamblers die broke. The important thing is not how you die but how you live. Look Steve, I'm dickering for a new place up in Saratoga. Lots of ground, a casino, a floor-show. I'm going to need a man to handle the game room. It's yours. Thanks just the same, Joe. What's the matter? Isn't a quarter interest enough? Twenty-five percent of anything is just a toe-hold. The way my luck has been running lately .. Anything you made at Saratoga would be just chickenfeed. Sometimes I think a little slap in the face wouldn't hurt him, either. Tens and fours. No good. Jacks and deuces. Nothing holds up. - Just like a poker game, ain't it. Funny man. I love a cheerful loser. - You love a loser. I need a drink. Deal you in? - Yeah. Make mine straight ginger ale. It's .. It's none of my business Mr Maddux but .. Shouldn't you quit before you drop the whole load? You're right. It is none of your business. It's your bet, Maddux. - Check. I'll open for 300. These look pretty good. Play. Up 250. A thousand more. Don't you like 500, Maddux? I can count. George. That makes an even ten stack, Steve. 50 Gs. I said I could count. I know I may be making a fool of myself but .. I'll make it an even five grand. El foldo. - Makes me a ribbon clerk. I'll go along. This creek is too deep for me. - Cards? Two. Fletcher? One. Just one. - One. It's your bet, Fletcher. How much you got there, sonny? Bet. Let's say .. Forty-five hundred? Let's. And a thousand more. Okay. From her on sucker, I'll make it painless. Full house. Aces over Kings. Just a minute. Sucker. Mind settling now? And don't forget your cab fare. [ Laughter ] [ Laughter ] There is only one kind of a job that a busted ex-gambler can get. Go ahead, kill me. - Elevator operator. Up, down. Up, down. That's very funny. So I kicked myself in the ash-can. Too bad. If you had that fifty grand now you could still buy in on Saratoga. If I had wheels, I'd be a bicycle. That's it, Mr Marino. Brad, if you're through with Joe, I wish you'd give me a going-over. Sock me where it will do the most good. You'll have to wait in line, Mr Maddux. I've got to beat some sense into a lot of other customers first. What gives with you next? Go back to matching pennies I guess or start looking for that elevator job. I may have a thing for you if you change your mind about working for in-laws. Stop rubbing it in. I've learned my lesson. - Have you? Don't worry about that. Okay chump, come here. I want to show you something. What's the gag? - No gag. I don't get it. - But I did. There is your money. All the fifty grand. Except the thousand I had to pay for last night's work. You mean you had that game rigged? How'd you guess? Of all the dirty low-down .. Never lose your temper. It isn't smart. I did you a favor. - A favor? - Yeah. Figured you needed a lesson. You made a sap out of me in front of the guys .. So what? You'd have thrown that dough away on the nags anyhow. There is always one guy that's smarter than you. Remember that. I'll try. Feel better? - Yeah. I knew I couldn't lose. In an honest game. [ Singing from LP record ] You mind if I play a record of my own? - Your own? The one about a columnist who met a girl and couldn't keep her out of his column. Or his mind. It's a wonderful night isn't it, Don. Said she, turning the record over. Look. I know it is illegal to get serious on Broadway so .. Shall we dance? Are you sure you mean dance? Of course. It's my only chance to hold you. Like this. Better not. Suppose I got to like it? I spend roughly half my time hoping that you will. And the other half? Worrying why you won't. As if I didn't know it. I'm sorry, Don. No, you're not really but it's .. It's nice to hear you say so. He must be quite a guy. I'm afraid he is to me. From a reporter's angle just what is his charm? Maybe it's just that .. [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] Just give me one guess who that is. Steve. - That's me. When did you get in? - Just a couple of hours ago. Oh, you're Don Corwin. My name is Maddux. I've heard of you. Don's been good enough to .. - I know. I read his column. No, Georgia is wrong. I haven't been good enough. Who do I send my check to? For what? Georgia's publicity and escort service. Steve, that isn't .. - It's alright, honey. From now on, you've got a new escort. Mind if I have a drink before we start? Start? For where? Saratoga. I think I left a hat around here somewhere. Please wait, Don. What's this all about, Steve? Joe is opening a new place at Saratoga. You're the star attraction of the Supper Club. Well, when does all this happen? - In a couple of days. In a couple of days Georgia opens in Fordham's show. I wouldn't worry about that. Well Steve, I can't just walk out on a contract. A contract? Oh you mean the one I bought today from Fordham? Fordham sold Georgia's contract? To you? That doesn't add up. It does on my adding machine. Don't you think you might have discussed this with me first? Well I wanted to surprise you, honey. I knew you'd like to work again for Joe. Sure I would, Steve. But .. Fordham's show is the break I've been waiting for and .. I can't just throw it out the window for Joe. Okay. Do you mind? Not at all. Thanks anyway, Georgia. Well I guess that calls off my deal. Your deal? - It doesn't matter. It's just that Joe promised to cut me in as partner if I could deliver you. I guess I didn't realize how much Fordham's show meant to you. I guess you didn't. It looks like Mr Broadway here has kind of taken over your life. That's not true, Steve. - No? Your name in his column practically every day. The deal to make records. The big build-up. Now you know, it's funny. I had an idea that maybe Saratoga was the big break for both of us. The way we'd always planned it. It's still the way we'd always planned it, Steve. You bought my contract from Fordham and .. It looks like I'll have to go to Saratoga. You don't have to do anything you don't want to, Georgia. The man is right, honey. I guess I ought to get us all drinks so we can all cool off. I'll be right back. Very corny, that performance. Was it? You're asking an awful lot of that girl. - No more than she'll get. So you ran up a bankroll overnight. So what? Is that any reason to yank Georgia off Broadway before she .. She doesn't need Fordham for that. Not as long as she's got me. I could make her a star too. Quicker and bigger. Say goodnight to Georgia for me. A pleasure. Like the new girl? I'm crazy about her. - I don't like the way you said that. I don't like the way you sold Georgia's contract. I thought you were turning handsprings over her. - She's okay. You didn't have to sell her contract. - Didn't I? For a bright guy Don, you certainly get lapses. Don't you see the pretty little picture? - What pretty little picture? The one where Steve Maddux and that shadow of his walked in on our friend. Oh? High-pressured you? I don't want any tough guys moving in on my shows. And I don't want any part of a tough guy's girl. Funny. Two and two still make four. Where are you going? Saratoga. Going to see a man about a girl. That's my selection. You want to have my bet? - Sure, but I hope it works this time. That's a great system you've got there only it never wins. While you of course get the dope from the horses personally? Three out of three isn't exactly bad. - You're not home yet. Mr Maddux? How long for you to collect? The ladies got some hot bets they want to get down. Right away. First, I got news. Hey look Ruby, our money is on a beautiful horse. My pet, the way a horse looks can only interest another horse. You sure you don't want me to handle the .. Visitors? That won't be necessary yet. Trouble, Steve? - Not unless he asks for it. Who? Or do we just keep on guessing? Why didn't you tell me Don was here? I've got to see him. - Why? I never had a chance to explain things. - Oh, he understands things. Relax. Let go, Steve. I'll be right back. Oh, honey. You might mention to him that he's wandered a long way from home. You will never learn, will you. No editorials. What's the matter? No bet for you? Two-year-old sprints are too tough to figure. Got a match, mister? Sure. Thanks, Don. Georgia! Remember me? After a fashion. - Am I welcome? They don't make them more welcome. Sit down. You know Bill Fellows? - Oh, yes. He's the man who doesn't approve of me. Not you, Miss King. Your playmates. What's wrong with Steve? Why, nothing that I can prove. It was self-defence with Bender, wasn't it? Who is Bender? When did you get to Saratoga? Just before the first race. - You staying long? That depends on you. I don't like to butt into a closed game but we ought to have a little talk. I think you're right. But not here. Why not come to the club after the race? - Won't Mr Chips be there? There is no reason why you two can't be friendly. There is one reason. You. Please. That did it. I'll be there and be nice to Mr whatshisname, even if he kills me. Well, you're doing better. This time you were fifth. We were saying .. Nothing we can't take up a little later. Don't forget. The club after the races. Right. It won't work. Don't be too sure. That's very pretty music you're playing. Hiya, Lucky. How'd you do? On the horses alright. What about this end? Horse room $28,500. Track betting commission. $14,800. Game room. $29,600. Total: $72,900 plus the supper club. Not bad for a quiet week, eh? That makes my share 18,225 bucks. That's alright. Say, you don't need this gadget, do you. That's for kids. My own share I can always figure by myself. By the way, I'd like it fine if you'd remember that's just what you got. A share. Firing dealers without my okay is out. Also, your last expense account was a little steep. Also, you need not buy champagne for all your friends and charge it to the house. Anything else? Any time you feel that this place is a little too small for the both of us .. Yes? I'm ready to buy you out and struggle along by myself. There was a time when you didn't feel that way. Time passes by as the poets say. Hey, just a minute. I'm going downstairs for a little workout. You wouldn't like to put on the gloves, huh? Don't tempt me. Look who I've found. He wants to see Miss King. - That's understandable. Hello Corwin. Meet my partner, Joe Marino. And friend of Steve's is a friend of mine. He's looking for a sparring partner. Don't let his muscles scare you. I don't scare easy. Or is it "easily"? That you may get a chance to prove. See you around. You are .. Friend here picked a very funny place to carry a fountain pen. He writes a lot. He won't have to take any notes on this conversation. Boo! It's alright, Candy. I won't be far, Mr Maddux. I .. I'm not keeping you from anything am I? Like I'm keeping you from Georgia, for instance? That's the general idea. I'd love to sit here and chew the fat with you, Corwin. But right now I am due downstairs .. to punch the bag. Strong back. Weak mind, eh? You wouldn't like to join me would you? Just until Georgia shows up? I might. You know. Just for laughs. Yeah, I know. Just for laughs. No timekeepers, no seconds, no bells, huh? You don't need any of that. You're among friends. But if you keep sticking your nose in other people's affairs. You're liable to get it knocked off. That's not bad for a newspaper man. I've met your style before. It's very tricky. But how do you like it when the going gets tough? Someday, Georgia is going to get wise to you. Keep her name out of this. A little surprised, eh? From now on life is going to be full of surprises for you. You're the one that's messing up Georgia's name. And get this .. You're not going to do it much longer. You may be smart. But you still need a little polishing off. Georgia is not for you. There is a little package for you. Let me fix him for you, Mr Maddux. Let me cool him off. Don't hang around me. Beat it. Okay, Mr Maddux. Isn't Don here yet? That's five times you've asked me in the last hour. Well it isn't like Don to stand people up. And I'm worried. Another half hour and I'll start worrying myself. What about? Or am I intruding? Would it make any difference? Frankly, no. Steve, what happened to you? Nothing important. Bumped into a fellow in the dark. Are you sure it was in the dark? - I'm sure. Is it any of your business? - Might be. Maybe I'd better look around for an old friend. He might have hurt his hand on that eye of yours. Steve. Did you and Don ..? - Why don't you ask Don? I will. If I can find him. Don't go away. Oh, Jack. Yes, sir? - Where is Candy? I haven't seen him all evening, Mr Maddux. Don, you're a sucker. Wouldn't you just love to have a piece of rubber hose in your hand right now. You let Maddux get away with everything short of murder. And the next pass he makes at you might be just that. I call that compounding a felony. No. Just call it contributory negligence. It's a private affair that I reserve the right to handle in my own private way. If the time comes and I find I'm working against gravity, I'll send for you. But right now, Bill. Hippety hop. Hippety hop. Thanks a lot. Well, at least the hospital says he's going to live. I tried my best. Who asked you to step in? Didn't you want his wagon fixed? - Did I say so? Well, not exactly. You won't understand but this was a private fight. The guy beat your brains in. - So what? It was a lucky punch. The next time I throw the lucky ones. You mean, after what he did to you, you didn't want anything to happen to him? That's exactly what I mean. I don't understand you, Mr Maddux. Then maybe you can understand this. Now beat it. Did you get your bonus? - Yeah. Just now. What bonus? Put a nice little job on Don. That was done without my knowing it. Nothing ever happens around here Steve without you knowing it. In advance. This time something did. Don Just .. Just walked into a door? Or maybe a pile of bricks just fell on him? For once, I'm in the clear Georgia. Believe me. Like I did when you told me Joe wouldn't take you in as a partner without me? I did that because I wanted you with me. Do you believe that? Look me up in New York sometime, Steve. Maybe I'll know the answer by then. Okay. If that's the way you want it. You dance pretty well for a man who's just been out of hospital a few weeks. The doctors say I'm as good as new. That's good enough. It might be. You never can tell. Well, in that case. Did I say something to encourage you? I'm still a little delirious you know. I thought your arm was hurt, too. Yes, but it needs to be exercised. You see the doctor said for me to press it occasionally .. Against some soft, yielding object. Hold it. Love to. Thanks. That's still no excuse for Steve not showing up three times this week. Georgia's taking a powder hit him pretty hard. It doesn't look like it hit Georgia very hard. Who is that for? Mr Maddux. He just came in with some friends. Wait a minute. Give Mr Maddux that for his dessert. Yes, sir. Thanks, Charlie. Make with the champagne, Candy. Ned some help? - That won't be necessary. Champagne bottles and women should always be handled the same way. You take them firmly by the waist. - What's wrong with my waist? Not a thing, baby. Mr Maddux? - Yeah? This may hand you a laugh. Don't move a muscle. "Georgia King, the frill with the thrill .." "Has been constantly with Don Corwin, Broadway's most eligible columnist." "Can that be the reason they're polishing what bells in what church?" Come on, Candy. Where are we going, Mr Maddux? To polish the bells in what church. Hey, what about us? This new, Mr Maddux. Never saw you chasing a dame before. You still haven't. There is an angle, huh? - Yeah. A reverse angle. [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] How did you get in? An elevator boy can always use an extra five bucks. Still buying your way in everywhere you want to go, aren't you Steve. Almost anywhere. What do you want? I'm getting dressed to go out. I just came by to lay my heart at your feet. A career can always use an extra one to walk around on. Your heart is like a banana peel, Steve. Anyone who tries to walk on it skids. Okay. I'm leaving. I .. just want to watch you pick up the chips. The chips? - Yeah. You won. They're yours. Alright. I've picked them up. Goodbye. "Goodbye", just like that? - No, Steve. We started out like this. Can't we end it the same way? Will you go then? - Yeah. You promise? - Yeah. Alright, go. For that? The guy who'd say goodbye to you for a bellhop's tip has insulted you. Now get out of here. No. Now we call Don. So you were lying again? That's right. The first time I see you crying, it's for somebody else. Maybe it's because you haven't seen me enough lately. Maybe it's because each time I have seen you lately, it's been the wrong time. Oh, let's forget about it. I'm going in to fix my face, and you can mix some drinks while I'm gone. Wait a minute. Maybe I'm not any good? It's rather late for that now, isn't it? I should have thought of that six years ago. If it will help any, I .. I wasn't lying to you then and I've just found out I'm not lying to you now. When you finish your face, put on your hat and coat. My hat? You can wear a hat long enough to be married, can't you? Why, I thought this building was vermin-proof. Anybody send for you, mister ..? Oh, you remember me. The guy you massaged up in Saratoga. Oh. Oh, the one who didn't have sense enough to stop messing with my boss's girl. That's right. You wouldn't care for a little massage yourself now, would you? Well, if it isn't the press. Why didn't you announce the gentlemen, Candy? What are you peddling Georgia now? The last thing I had in stock. A set of wedding bells. I don't believe you. You'd better if you don't want to be scooped on this item. It will be a simple little affair at the civic chapel. Where is Georgia? In there. We tried to catch you on the phone tonight to ask you to be best man. Is this marriage stuff .. on the level? Look in your paper tomorrow morning and see. Okay. I will. No parting words for me? Just this. I owe you plenty. And I'm a guy who likes to pay his debts. This isn't the time or the place. But when it is! Why thank me for the free publicity? My column just naturally look better with you name in it. How was the honeymoon? - "Wonderful." "Aren't you going to congratulate the bride?" Congratulations. When does the new club open? A couple of weeks now. That's why we hurried back. Steve wanted to check the final details personally. Will you save me the best table on opening night? "Why, naturally." Tell Steve I wish him the best of luck. And I'm glad you're back. I'm glad too. She brought along a fellow who once had a pal of mine beat up. Leave him alone. She loves him and that's enough for me. Oh, we're in our noble mood today, huh? No, but the thing is done. And that's that. Maybe you're right. But as usual, I doubt it. Help yourself. You are talking like a cop again. What's up? Remember you once asked me: who's Bender? That's right and you never did tell me. Who is Bender? - You mean, who was he? Okay, tight-lips. There is a citizen outside, looks like a tipster. Send him down to the city desk. See you later. He wants to see you special. Name of Fitzroy. He said he used to be a waiter out west in Joe Marino's club. Bring him straight in. Come in, Mr Fitzroy. Sit down. What have you got to tell me? - It will cost you fifty dollars. I don't pay in advance for information. This is not an account in a bank, Mr Corwin. Fifty dollars is cheap. I'll pay you what it's worth after I hear it. Alright. You told the boy you were a waiter in Joe Marino's club? Not a regular waiter. I was working extra that night. New year's eve. Very interesting, but hardly worth fifty dollars. Now just a minute, Mr Corwin. I saw Mr Bender that night. Remember Felix Bender? Bender? Of course. Isn't he the .. fellow who .. Yes, the man the police thought was murdered. And me? Well .. I feel kind of responsible. How's that? Bender asked me how to get up to Mr Marino's office and I showed him. Did you see him leave? - Yes, I saw that too. "This must have been about 3am." "Everybody was gone." "I was busy sweeping up some broken glass from under the stairs." "I heard footsteps above me and when I looked up." "Mr Maddux and another fellow he called Candy were helping Bender out." "And believe me, he needed plenty of help the shape he was in." "Well I figured at the time the guy was drunk or something." "But the next day when I read the papers." "I realized Bender wasn't drunk. He was dead." Go on. Well that's all. Isn't that enough? Yeah, that's enough. Do you think my story is worth fifty dollars, Mr Corwin? Your story is worth a hundred dollars on one condition. Yes, sir? That you don't tell this to anybody else. Understand? Nobody. - Oh, sure. Thanks. Thanks again. Mr Fitzroy. Yeah? You got a story for me too? A story? - Yeah. A story. Thank you, Mr Fitzroy. Have somebody drive him home. How's about picking Maddux up now? Uhuh. I don't get this. For months you've been trying to dig up evidence. Now it walks right into your mitts and you don't use it? Maddux don't know we want him. So I thought maybe we might settle a lot of old scores all at once. Like when? Like when he opens his new club. We can clean him up clean that night. Every penny he got out of selling his Saratoga place is sunk in this place. It won't be so easy. He's selling gold membership keys to the steel door of his gambling room. At a hundred bucks a throw. - I know. We're all going to members on opening night. Huh? This one is gold. And cost a hundred bucks. These cost two bits apiece. [ Singing: ] "I can't believe it. It's hard to conceive it." "That you would turn away." "Romance." "Are you pretending?" "It looks like the ending." "Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear .." "My life a wreck, you're making." "You know I'm yours." "Just for the taking." "I'd gladly surrender .." "Myself to you." "Body .." "And soul." It looks like you hit the jackpot. Yeah, three plums can't miss. Georgia, the Supper Club and the little room in back. Hmm? My insurance against breaking even in front. Come on now, I'll show you around. Steve. A nice club you've got here. - Thanks. Tell your friends. I will. Maddux. Congratulations. On which? Georgia or the club? Both, I hope. I hope you get your hope. He's become quite a figure around town hasn't he. Yeah. A regular meteor. Is that another name for a flash in the pan? A neat little can-opener, huh? It's all according to what you've got in there. Sardines or gold fish. Well, we're packing them in like sardines, but they are really goldfish. Mrs Marino, Mr Marino. Hello, Mr Maddux. - How are the games running? Smooth as silk. Take a good look around, but don't lose too much. I don't want anything on my conscience tonight. Hello, Bill. What are you doing here? Oh, I thought I might catch some of New York's night-life. You always bring the rest of the squad along when you do? I thought they might enjoy a little fireworks themselves. Look Bill, if you're thinking to start something, I wish you'd call it off. Like you did to that story that Mr Fitzroy gave you? It was a phony yarn. The kind we toss in the waste basket a hundred times a day. Maybe you did. But not me. Why don't you stop acting like one of the Rover boys. There must be some other numbers in your address book. I'm not going by the book. When I met Georgia, I tossed it away. Then tossed her right into Maddux's arms. There can be a return trip. And you'd take her marked down at any price, huh? Whatever you want to call it. Sorry, Don. You're making my job a little harder but you're not stopping me. Let me in. I've got to see Steve. - Oh, sure. Sure. You want to go on a picnic with him, wouldn't you. Quit horsing around. This is urgent. - Oh, urgent? Well why don't you send him a postcard for an appointment. Listen you clown, tell him they're going to pull a raid tonight. That's a new way to crash the gate. And since when would you be doing him a favor? Loosening up? - Plenty. Listen Mr Maddux. This will land you the laugh of the week. - Yeah? Your pal Corwin just tried to crash the gate. Did you throw him out on his neck? - You bet. He tried to get in by pulling a corny line about somebody staging a raid. A what? - A raid. Get him up here, stupid. I don't like the guy but I trust him. Go on. Quick. Place your bets. Okay. Number 7, red. 7 red. Everybody up against the wall. Say, you can't pull this .. - Get your hands up and get over there. Will there be serious trouble, Joe? Not if Steve behaves himself. Up here everybody. If this is a stick-up it won't work. I can cover everybody with this. It's no stick-up. We're the police. The next time anybody steps in front of that table I aim higher. You know me, don't you? That one is for you, Fellows. I should have told you the glass was bullet-roof. I'll give you two minutes to come down from there. And I'll give you one minute to clear out of this place. Isn't there any way we can get in there? Not without a gold key. Say, Fellows. There is a way to stop this. I can talk him down. If you can, go ahead. His time is running out. Don't move, Joe. I just want to talk to you. Since when do you play with coppers? You got the wrong idea, Steve. Well, somebody framed this raid. - Don't lose your head. Get back, Joe! - Look. There goes Maddux. Get him! I saw what happened, Mr Maddux. I got to the car as fast as I could. Good boy. Attention. Eight State alarm. Code 12CJ. Steven C Maddux, aged 28. "Height: 5 feet 11. Complexion: dark." "No record of convictions, no fingerprints." Is Joe Marino here? Hello, Joe. We haven't seen you around any of your restaurants lately. I've been kind of busy. Looking for somebody who might know where a certain somebody is holed up? Don't mix in this, Corwin. Another gunfight isn't going to settle anything, Joe. Think of Georgia. She's his wife. Ruby was mine. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Don. Did you find Joe? I found him alright. The only thing that's keeping him alive is his hope of seeing Steve dead. He wouldn't listen. He wouldn't. Where were you going? - For a walk. With a cop watching this building from every corner? This is no time to play games. You know where Steve is, don't you? How would I know? I'll answer that too. But remember this. Every step you take towards Steve brings him a step closer to the electric chair. Now do you still want to see him? What do you think? Look baby, your phone is tapped. They've got more cops downstairs than you'll find at a policeman's ball. Why do you think you can get to him before they can? I didn't say I was going to see Steve. Okay. Keep on lying to me. And to yourself. Listen junior, if anything happens to Mrs Maddux I'm holding you responsible. Don't know how you got in without being spotted. I'm smart that way. - Then stay smart. Go out the same way. - Yes, sir. But if a police car gets on your tail, lose it before you take her to Steve .. Or don't take her. Yes, sir. I'm sorry I lied to you, Don. So what. You're in love. Good luck to both of you. Can I see him alone, Candy? Sure, Mrs Maddux. [ Whistling ] Hello, Steve. You shouldn't have come here. Candy shouldn't have brought you. I insisted, Steve. - Why? So you could see me like this? Not much left of the big-shot you married, is there. I never cared whether you were or weren't a big-shot. Thanks. Doesn't a husband kiss a wife when he hasn't seen her for a while? Sure he does. Well? Oh Steve, we've got to get you out of here. It's all set. I'm leaving tonight. Candy is lining things up. I won't worry about clothes. I can buy anything I need wherever we're going. You aren't going with me. I've done enough to you already. Afraid to have me with you? What is there left for me to be afraid of? Me? Steve Maddux, the lam-ster. Hiding out like a sewer-rat. Afraid of the light and making faces at my soul in the dark. Think of me. I am. Joe. Just before everything goes black, Ruby. I've got to mean nothing more to you, Georgia. Corwin won't help you pick up the pieces I left for your life. You're still better off. When do you pick me up, and where? You never know when you're well off, do you. I never have. Never will. I'll call the apartment and let you know where and .. When. Well, she's home okay, Mr Maddux. Was that one of your brilliant ideas? Bringing Georgia to this rat-hole? She begged me. It didn't do any harm. In two minutes she took me back over the last ten years. I can still here that corny band playing the night I told her she was my girl. "I know it", she said. Just like that. "I know it". That was when I made up my mind to be a big-shot, but quick. And now you had to bring her here and let her see me like this. All the rest of her life she'll remember me in this creep joint. A weasel on the lam. I'm sorry, Mr Maddux. Especially for you. You're what? I said I was sorry for you. You shouldn't have done that, Mr Maddux. So, I shouldn't have. Now go on and get things set. I want to get out of here. Yes, sir. Oh, just a minute. You'd better leave your gun here in case something happens while you're gone. Hello? Joe? Yeah, he's right here. For you, Joe. It's Candy. "Yeah, Candy?" - Stop at the foot of Garrick Street. Turn your lights off. And flash them on three times with about a second between. Now watch yourself, Joe. He's got a rod. Mid-town Squad. Hartley speaking. Fellows? No, not in. Wait. He did leave a number. Skylar 9-3-8-3-5. If one of my men hadn't lost you and Candy at Lewis Street we'd have had him. Which way did you turn from there? You can only help Steve by talking. With the law he has one chance in ten. But if Joe gets to him first it's one in a thousand. Steve is a gambler. He always liked the short end of a bet. Wait a minute. I'll answer it. Hello? I'm going to say this just once, copper. So listen good. Steve Maddux was killed tonight at the Garrick Street pier. At ten o'clock. Ten o'clock? But it's only nine thirty-five .. Get your coat. Go ahead of us to the Garrick Street pier. Call for two more cars on your radio. [ Radio: ] "From one end of the country to the other the adult citizens of the land .." "Greeted the repeal of prohibition with mingled feelings and even .." Candy? Right here, Mr Maddux. Well, show a light. That's enough. Cut it off. Now go round the corner and wait for me. Somebody else is waiting for you, Steve. Who is that? - Ruby. Ruby is waiting for you. Do you know who this is, Mr Maddux? Candy. Mister Candy to you. Wait a minute. He's mine. What do you want? I fingered him for you, didn't I? I didn't mean that thing up in Saratoga. I didn't want to hurt you bad. Please Mr Corwin. Please don't! Don't, don't, don't. No. He's yours. Hello Corwin. How am I doing? Not so good. Who gave it to you, Maddux? Did I have it coming to me? - You did. Then what's the d?fference? "Yeah, that's the story of Steve Maddux." "A guy with a lot of wrong ideas." * steve d *
