¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ No, wait, wait. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ What do you want in a neighborhood? What do you want in a home? At Harrison Homes, we build beautiful award-winning homes and develop dynamic new communities. With numerous awards and over thirty years of experience, Harrison Homes has become a household name.

That's why we've built a company that builds so much more than quality homes. ¶ At Harrison Homes we don't just build homes, we build community. Bullshit. They forgot to mention the depressing unfinished lots. Morning Kiddo. Coffee ready? We're out of the ergo chuck, but we still have some instant. Gross. Right, I almost forgot you inherited your father's coffee snobbery. Maddie up yet? I dunno. ¶ You should ask me something. Like what? I don't know. Isn't there something new you want to learn about me? Or, I don't know. No, I think I've got you pretty much figured out. Damn. Here I was thinking I was all was all dark and mysterious and shit. OK. Favorite movie? Reanimator, that was easy. Favorite non-horror movie? Oh, that's a good one. Ahhh, I wanna say, Weekend at Bernie's. No, Weekend at Bernie's part 2. That one's sick. Is that the one with the dancing dead dude on vacation? Yeah, it's awesome. You've never seen it? Sorry old man but you're the only one who knows it exists. Ah, Maddie. Alright, double feature next weekend. And what are you going to do for me? I'll introduce you to two comedy classics? - And? - Pizza? Deal. Awesome. Now, you ask me something. This is actually kind of fun. Alright. Favorite band? Sabbath. You already know that. Something harder. OK. If you could kill anyone and get away with it, who would it be and how would you do it? Likely everyone's first choice, Hitler. No. It's gotta be someone real. Hitler wasn't real? No. Like someone you know. A family member or someone from school. I'll go with no one then, you creep. Why, who would you kill? Still can't believe I'm letting her date an older boy. I should probably check to see if it's even legal. I Googled it. It's totally legal. Still super gross though. I guess she is nineteen. She can pretty much date whoever she pleases. I mean, I'd let her have this one. She's got enough drama with the move and everything. Interfering now would likely cause some kind of Romeo and Juliet situation. I know. I don't like moving any more than you kids, but I think we can make this place cool, right? It's a thousand times better than the townhouse. You did good, Mom. When did you get so mature? Aw! I take it back! You little pig. It is a pretty nice place though, isn't it? Nicest place I've ever lived. Yeah, but we're not exactly surrounded by the coolest of people. There's some cool people. Alice is cool. She's cute too. Don't be gross. Morning, Maddie! You trying to get rid of me? I feel so used. OK, seriously, my Mom's gonna hear you. OK, just one more. OK. OK, I'm gone. Hurry! I've gotta pee! Nice view. You pervert! Hey, I'll see you later. ¶ Looks like Grandpa Sandy without his dentures. Be nice! Messaging Lucifer? Luther! And it's none of your business. I just think it's cute you found someone as emo as you. Don't you have to school today? No, I got Fridays off, remember? Don't you have work? What does it look like? Considering we all have the day off, would you kids like to do something together? Like what? There's not really much to do around here. We could go to the zoo. No thanks. Didn't you read about the eight dead penguins last week? It was just a suggestion, Maddie. She's just worried the reptile exhibit will remind her of her ex-boyfriends. At least I have an ex. Kids, it's early! Put a pin in it for a sec. Is everything OK, Maddie? You seem a little on edge. I didn't sleep very well last night. I'm sorry to hear, but can you at least try to be nice. Sorry, Mom. ¶ Is it too early to play? Nope! ¶ What? I just love you, is all. I made you from scratch. Mom! Go a little easy on me, hey? Whatever, you kicked my ass last time. Oh! We both just died I think. ¶ ¶ ¶ Weird. ¶ Nope. Too serious. Way too young! Why would this child even set his range as high as mine? How do I get this stupid thing off my phone? Hey guys, there's some dude running around barefoot out there! The young ones are just on a 'cougar hunt' and the men my age are looking for girls half my age. Be patient, Mom. It's a numbers game. That's very nice Maddie, but I'm not going to rush into anything. Especially not with Russell here. His profile picture is a pizza! If you guys are done, you should just quit so I can play. Don't interrupt, Nerd. OK, well whoever dies first, I'm next, OK? No, I'm gonna take my time, I'll try dating the old fashioned way. Who knows, may Lewis knows some people. Not likely! Lewis? That guy sucks. Remember how mad he got at your fortieth when you let me and Tim have a beer? He called you so many names. Immature, rebellious, irresponsible! Can't those jerks go one morning without construction? I told you this neighborhood will never be finished. I think he even called you a dirty hippie at one point. He was very drunk that night. He apologized. Yeah, like months later. Even just last week, he got so angry when we left those cardboard boxes on the lawn overnight. Dude is so anal. Did you know that term comes from when babies won't poo as an act of control over their parents? Ew. I don't even want to know how you know that. I read. You should try it sometime. I do read, you turd! Kids, sometimes you have to be nice to people that you don't like in order to stay friends with the people that you do like. Lewis may be difficult but Alice is worth it. I'll say. God, you're gross. No package from your dad today? No. ¶ It's early still. ¶ I bet it shows up later. I don't know why you don't just stream it. Do they even make DVDs anymore? A, it's a Blu-ray and 2, special features. Speaking of your father, can you guys have him pick up that box of random crap when he comes to grab you next weekend? ¶ Why don't you just tell him yourself? What was that Maddie? Nothing. ¶ What are those? I don't know. You didn't even look. Those red envelopes, what are they? I'm guessing some junk telling us how to become millionaires in three simple steps. You are no help. ¶ ¶ Weird, it's addressed to me. The others are for you two. Wedding invitations? Maybe. Pretty creepy choice for a wedding invitation. Creepy? Wait, are you and Lucifer getting married? What? Shut up, loser! Oh my God, I can picture it now, black candles, a Nine Inch Nails cover band playing 'Hurt' as you walk down the aisle, hands bound together in black leather and Dad standing there, shaking his head in disappointment. I said shut the fuck up! Did you just throw a banana at me? You need to relax, I was only joking. Jokes are supposed to be funny, Asshole. Stop it you two! What are those, wedding invitations? Very funny. Here, there's one for each of us. ¶ So, what is it? Hang on. ¶ Hang on. ¶ Is this some kind of joke? ¶ What? What does it say? ¶ Who would send such a thing? Mom? Tim, Honey? Does that letter tell you to. Kill someone? Sure does. What? Red Letter Day. How much do you trust the world outside the comfort of your manicured reality? How well do you know your friends and neighbors outside of the safe bubble of your online persona? Welcome to Red Letter Day. Your instructions are as follows: kill this person before they kill you. The person in this photo has been selected using data from your online activity. You have been matched with someone with conflicting beliefs within five kilometers of your residence. They too have been sent this same letter with your image and address. Happy hunting and good luck. Then there is an address below Alice's photo. Mine says the exact same thing except for it's just a picture of some random bald dude. Maddie, what does yours say? I'm not opening that. Knowing my luck, you probably got me. Don't you dare! Chill out, Maddie. It's just some dumb prank. Chill out? We received letters telling us to kill people! I'm sorry, if I'm finding it kinda difficult to take this seriously. I mean look at this dude! The only thing he's murdering is a full series of Firefly in one sitting. This isn't funny, Tim! OK, just calm down, OK, calm down. For all we know, we're the only people who received these. OK, let's just open your letter then I'll call the police. No! I want no part of this! If you guys want to play this stupid game, then that's on you. Me? I want nothing to do with this shit. Maddie, come- ¶ How about we just give her a minute to calm down, hey? Yeah. You're probably right. It's likely just some dumb prank, but I should call the police. Give me a minute. ¶ 911, what's your emergency? I think my family has been threatened. We received letters telling us to kill somebody before they kill us. Who the hell is this dude? Is there anybody in your home threatening you presently? No, not presently. Thank you. Connecting you with the Lakeview police department. ¶ Hello, I'd like to report a threat on my life. Is there someone threatening you in person right now, Miss? No, not presently. I received a strange letter. A letter? Yeah, this letter tells me to kill one of my neighbors before they kill me. It says that they received the same letter. Have you tried discussing this with your neighbor? No. I literally just received this, and thought that I should notify you first in case any other letters had been reported. ¶ It's likely just a prank. Do you have children? Yes, I have children. Look, I really don't need to be patronized right now. What would you like us to do? Your job maybe? You could, I don't know, look into this or something! ¶ I am cooperating, just please. I'll give you any information that you need. OK, we can send an officer out to look into this tonight at six. What? That's... That's nine hours from now! ¶ Your life isn't in any immediate danger? Well, yes. I'm not in any immediate danger. Well, if that status changes, contact us again and someone will be there in moments. ¶ Well, that was horrible. What did they say? They're sending a cop at six. Christ. Are you gonna see if Alice got the same thing? Yeah. I'll give her a call in a bit. First, let me see your letter. Joe Dennis? Are you sure you don't know this man? Never seen him before in my life. Wait, is this the guy that walks his cat? You know, the weird balding one? You know, I remember the cat but not the dude. I think this is pretty close. Well, I did just unpack my telescope. I'll be there in a second. Honey, we're going to spy on the neighbors, want to join? No! ¶ OK, let's take a look here. ¶ Tim? What? ¶ Holy shit! That's totally a fluke Mom! We bought you this to look at the stars. Not to be a creep. Honestly, I haven't used that thing since I unpacked it. I swear on my life. Do we need to have another discussion about consent? Mom! ¶ Alright. I believe you. Come on, Creep. Let's get creeping. ¶ Looks like Professor X hasn't checked his mail yet. Just kinda looks like another boring morning in Aspen Ridge, doesn't it? Yeah. Hang on a sec. I think this is him. Let me see! ¶ That's totally him! Oh good, it looks like he's leaving for the day. One less thing to worry about. ¶ Does he have a letter in his mailbox? Can't tell. It's one of those old school ones on a post. ¶ You know, this is actually kind of fun. Aside from the creepy letters and everything. ¶ What's sporty Kevin Smith is up to over here? ¶ Damn, looks like he also got a letter. Let me see. ¶ Christ. ¶ You know, now would probably be a good time to give Alice a call. Yeah. ¶ Mel! Hey Ali. Hang on a sec. I'm guessing you received one of those stupid letters too? Yeah, pretty messed up, hey? Oh God! Looks like I'm dealing with a bit of a Poo-naumi over here. You have my sympathy. Lewis, a little help over here? Sorry about this, Mel. Look, do you mind just swinging by for a cup of tea or something? Visit me and this stinky baby? Yeah. Sure, I can come by in a little bit. OK, chat soon. You made a big mess. Yes, you did. ¶ Mom, please. You don't need to do this. She's just a few houses down. I'll be ten minutes, fifteen tops. But what if- Maddie, come on. This is Alice we're talking about here. At least, take this. For protection. Tim, put that back right now! I think we should just call Dad. OK, come on, look, whoever sent these letters is trying to get us to behave irrationally for their own sick pleasure or whatever. I think we should just call Dad. He would know what to do. I can assure you that your father would not keep his cool in this situation. He would likely just barricade all the windows. Maybe that's not such a bad idea. It's better than what you've got! ¶ Look, just stay here. I'll be back soon. We good? I love you. I love you too, Tim, but let's not act like it's the end of the world, OK? Take care, Maddie. Oh, and lock the door behind me, OK? ¶ ¶ ¶ Hey, you're probably still in the air but I just wanted to let you know there's some really weird shit going on. I'm sure once you land, you'll hear all about it, but we just didn't want you to worry. We're safe for now, even if Mom did leave us home alone. ¶ Call back when you get this. I think you're being a little too hard on Mom. She's trying her best. Whatever. What kind of parent leaves her children alone during a time like this? Give me a break, Maddie. I mean, she's literally ten houses down in Aspen Ridge. Maybe the lamest neighborhood in the city. You might be taking these letters a little too seriously. I don't think you're taking them seriously enough. ¶ Damn, people are sure going nuts over this. Holy shit. Daria just posted a video of her Dad fighting. Really? Let's see. ¶ You try to act like you're innocent! Guess what? ISIS don't mean shit to me, Motherfucker! Listen, just get out of here before I call the cops! ISIS don't mean shit to me! You try to scare me? ISIS don't mean shit to me motherfucker. ISIS? What are you even talking about? I was born in this country! My parents were born in this country. I'll bet it was you ISIS fucks that even sent those letters, huh? You wanna kill me? You wanna fucking kill me? Come on, take your best shot! You're a loser. You're not even worth my time. What the fuck did you just say to me? What the fuck did you? Jesus Christ. What the fuck is wrong with people? I knew this was the type of shit that was hidden underneath the surface. I just figured most of it was in the U.S. Rednecks like that are just always looking for an excuse. People are shit. Try not to get too cynical, Maddie. I mean, there's plenty of good people. We're good people. Whatever you say. I just hope Daria is okay. Looks like there's a group taking credit for the letters. The Unknown? There's a video. ¶ Welcome to the inaugural Red Letter Day presented by your friends at The Unknown. Each of you has been assigned one person to kill before they kill you. What you do next is up to you. For too long have we been categorized and separated in the name of profit and control. Today, we engage. Will kindness and manners prevail, or will the true self-serving nature of humankind rear its ugly head? Stay tuned and happy hunting. What the fuck was that? Maybe we shouldn't have let Mom go to Alice's. ¶ Play it again. ¶ It's just Mel, ya big scaredy cat! Boo! Come in, come in. ¶ Damn! Somehow your house has become even more beautiful than the last time I saw it. Oh Mel, you're sweet. I don't think that much has changed. Melanie. Lewis. Hello Lucy. How's my favorite little lady doing? Looks like someone missed their Auntie. Green or black tea? Green would be lovely. Here, let me get that for you. OK. ¶ Has he been getting enough sleep lately? I'm sorry, he's been like this all morning. Lewis! Make yourself useful and put a kettle on for us. I hear you made a little mess this morning! The little stinker. How is it only nine AM and you've already managed to roast a chicken? I've been up since four with Lucy. We're trying to cut out deli meat. I read about another Listeria outbreak on Facebook. One more reason to become vegetarian, I guess. I would try, Lewis is more of a red meat kind of guy. ¶ Residents of the Calgary neighborhood of... Crazy start to the day, huh? Yeah, this is so messed up. Has anyone, you know? Not yet, as far as I know. They say to just to sit tight until the police figure it out. If the dickhead I spoke with this morning is on the case, I have no hope of it being resolved. Have a little compassion. Imagine putting your life on the line everyday only to be treated like an A-hole. Didn't you date a cop once? Ssshhhhh. Thanks, Louie. Uh huh. An anarchist group calling themselves the Unknown are taking responsibility. ¶ God, the news is so depressing these days. Mixed with all of these dystopian TV shows, you'd think the world is ending. We're not evening getting cable in the new place. Pinching pennies are we? The kids don't even watch it anymore and I'd rather read a novel or do something outside. To each their own. That's the picture these Weirdos decided to use? You look good! Thanks. So, which picture did they use for me? You were doing Yoga. Tim said you looked cute. Well, that's flattering. Crazy to think they can just gather all our information on the internet. It feels like such an invasion of privacy. I know. It's a strange new world. All your most intimate details up to the highest bidder. It makes you want to move to the mountains. I'd last about two week. Yeah, I guess we need to adapt. I mean, can you even remember what you used to in a line-up, or the waiting room or in the bathroom before you had a phone? Magazines. Newspapers. Archie! Oh yeah. I guess it's the same thing, just digital. And now you can voice all your thoughts without an opinions column. I try to stay away from all that garbage, but sometimes you just get sucked in. I just learned what a cuck was last week. I don't even want to know! So, who did Lewis get in his letter? I mean, you don't have to if it's uncomfortable. Mrs. Miller. I don't know if you've met her yet, but she is the cutest. Goes around every Christmas with a tin of cookies for everyone in the community. Strange he'd be paired with such a sweet old woman. I know, I mean I can't believe their data or whatever paired you and I together. I mean you do vote Conservative but. When are you going to stop grilling me about that? Last time, I promise. So who did the kids get? If you don't mind me asking of course. Classic Maddie. She just ripped hers up and stormed off to her room. Tim got this weird balding man. You might have seen him walking his cat. That guy? Oh he's so weird. That cat barely moves. I swear, I see him carrying it more than I see it walking. So, is Maddie still seeing that older boy? Yeah but I can't blame her. I mean, I went through a bad boy phase myself. More than once. Hell, I married one! I shouldn't stay long. I just wanted to say that I'm not taking this letter seriously. Like, at all. I appreciate it. I was going to call you right away, but I had to calm Lewis down first. You know how he gets. Yeah, the kids are freaking out too. I tried telling them this was likely just some dumb prank. Here's hoping. I should get back to the kids. So how are they adjusting to the move and everything? Tim is taking it like a champ but Maddie. I think she still really misses Kris. It's hard enough being 19. Just give it time. You got this. Thanks Ali. Here's hoping they finish that new complex soon. It would be great to have a cinema nearby. Oh gees, I cannot remember the last time we went to a movie. Not since Lucie was born anyway. Lewis, what was the last show we saw in the theatres? Lewis? Melanie, can you please explain why you brought a large knife into my home? ¶ ¶ Lucifer still hasn't responded? Nope. I wouldn't worry about it. His coffin likely hasn't let in the morning light yet. Dick. Oh fuck, looks like they're reporting a murder in town! What? "A custodian was attacked by a masked man using a hatchet at the Bass Pro Shop at Crossiron Mills this morning. Police Services suspect that this is the first known murder to occur in what is being referred to as Red Letter Day. Police remind citizens to stay inside and to keep all doors locked until more information is known. Follow updates online using the hashtag more breaking news as it happens." Bass Pro? Chances are this murder isn't even related to the letters. It's wild. Just wild. Oh fuck! Holy Fuck! Holy Fuck! Who is that Tim? Oh my God! Maddie, I need you go upstairs and call the police, OK? Go upstairs, lock the bathroom door and call the police! Who is that man, Tim? Why is he here? It's the man from my letter, Maddie! What the fuck, why is he outside? Quickly Maddie! Please go upstairs and call the police! What are you going to do? Come with me, please! I'm going to lock the doors and close the blinds, OK? I'll be right behind you. Why is this happening? Please Maddie, now! ¶ I'll be right behind you, OK, just go! ¶ Please just hurry. He's in my house right now! I understand, please stay where you are. An officer will the there in fifteen minutes. What the fuck am I supposed to do until then? He's here now! My brother is still downstairs! Please stay where you are ma'am. They will be there as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there is an extremely high demand for officers right now. I wish we could do something sooner, but it is simply not possible! ¶ ¶ Please. Hello? Hello Madison are you still with me? Madison? Please just come help us! ¶ Alice please! I can explain. Tim tried to give me that knife before I left the house, just in case something happened and he must have slipped it into my purse without me noticing. Right, and you just didn't happen to notice a gigantic carving knife in your purse? Well, I'm so fucking sorry Lewis, but as you may have noticed there's a lot of really weird shit going on today. Stop it! Stop it you two! Mel, why would Tim put the knife in there if he knew you were coming to my house? He's just a dumb kid. I'm sure he thought he was doing the right thing. I'm trying to believe you but does Tim think we're bad people? Do you think we're bad people? That's rich coming from the Edwards family. Excuse me, Lewis? What is that supposed to mean? What do you think it means? Lewis, can we please just discuss this upstairs? Do you have something against my family? Oh, where to start? You let your teenage daughter date a grown man. You leave trash all over your lawn and you're enabling your son to become an alcoholic just like his father. And you're one to talk! Don't think I don't know how much you spend on webcam models. What was it last month, Alice? Four thousand dollars? Five hundred dollars for just a pair of used panties. You told her about that? That was a secret, Melanie! I told you that in confidence! Well I guess it's all out in the open, now! And to think, me and my low-class family spent Christmas with you last year. How ashamed you must have been. What you must think of me to believe for one second that I was planning to use that knife on you! Look Alice, this is stupid. How long have we known each other? Ten years? Do not touch her! All we know is that we received a letter saying you would try to kill Alice and then you show up at our home with a ten inch blade! You will not lay another hand on me, Lewis. You got that? Then you will keep your distance from my wife. This has been a crazy day and clearly coming here was a bad idea. So I'm just going to get my things and go. You're not going anywhere. You are gonna stay right here until the authorities arrive. Alice, are you really going to let him behave this way? Are you going to let him treat me this way? Look Mel, just do what Lewis says. Alice, stop her, she's going for the knife! Alice, please. Are you fucking kidding me right now? My children are calling me. They need me, Tim needs me! I just want to answer my phone. I'm sorry. ¶ This is fucking crazy! Lewis, I'm sure we can work this out, just put down the knife! The only solution I can think of is to lock you in the basement until the police arrive. My children need me! That doesn't concern me, Melanie. What matters to me is the safety of my family. Shhhh. It's OK. So, the choice is yours. You go down by your own free will, or by force. But let's get one thing straight, you are not leaving this house until the police arrive. Lewis, I know that you are just trying to protect your family right now, but I am telling you one thing, in all seriousness right now, if you don't put down that fucking knife and let me get to my phone, we are going to have a problem here. Just try me, bitch. ¶ God. ¶ Alice. Take the baby upstairs, now! ¶ You shouldn't have done that. ¶ Mother, what the? I'm so sorry, Alice. I'm so sorry. Oh God, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry. You killed my husband! What have you done? You killed my husband! I'm sorry, Alice. He was just trying to protect me! ¶ Tim, Honey are you there? It's OK, Honey! It's OK, OK? I'll be there soon! Is your sister with you? OK good, that's good Tim, that was smart. OK, now I need you to go upstairs and hide with your sister. Can you do that for me, Tim? Can you hide with Maddie? OK. Gerry! You want some? Come and get it you faggot! ¶ I don't know what that sound is, Tim, but I need to hang up now, OK? I'll be there soon. You fucks. No one fucks with me. I'll be there soon. No one fucks with me! ¶ You fucks. No one fucks with me. No one fucks with me! ¶ Why would you try something like that, bitch? I knew you were the one that really wanted me dead! That letter was just a fucking excuse. I can't be the only one who wants to see you dead. Fuck you! What the fuck was that? ¶ ¶ ¶ You better run, Boy. ¶ Where are you running to? Like a little girl. Please, you don't need to do this! You don't have to do this! Please! Please, I don't want to fucking die! Please! Didn't anyone teach you millennials how to fight? Please, you don't have to do this! No, I don't have to. But I want to. Please! Please! Please, I don't want to die! Please, please. Mom? Mom, Mom, Mom. ¶ Mom, Mom. Please stop! Stop, please stop! Come on, please. Please, don't kill her, please stop! ¶ Please, please stop. ¶ You. Fucking. Cunt. Please stop. ¶ Honey, are you OK? You shouldn't have left us, Mom. I know, I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Are you OK? Oh, my God! Oh, God, we need to get you to a hospital! Mom, you're covered in blood! What happened at Alice's? I'm fine, it's OK. We need to get out of here. Where is your sister? She's upstairs, In the bathroom. OK good. Good, you did good, Tim. You did so so good. Is he dead? Yes. OK. I need you to stay here. I'm gonna go get Maddie and I'll be right back, OK? It's OK. I'll be right back. ¶ Maddie! Maddie, it's time to go! It's safe now! We need to get your brother to the hospital! Maddie? Are you in there? Open up! It's time to go! Maddie? ¶ Maddie? Maddie? Where are you, Maddie? Fuck. Oh, my God. Oh, God. ¶ What the fuck are you gonna do? ¶ Oh, you stupid girl. Maddie? Maddie! ¶ Madison! You call me back as soon as you get this, OK? Maddie, I hope you're OK. ¶ Where's Maddie? Let's see your hand. Where's Maddie? I don't know. I think she's at Luther's. Why would she leave the house? I don't know. I just, I don't know Tim, but we need to get out of here, OK? Here, I need you to take these. What are they? They're leftover T3s. They'll take your pain away, OK? You'll start to feel better soon, OK? What about my leg? I don't think I should touch that. I think I'll just make it worse. OK. Now, this is going to hurt for a second. It's going to hurt real bad, OK? And then as soon as we get your sister, then we're gonna get you right to the hospital. ¶ You are very brave, do you know that? ¶ OK, let's do this. Come on. ¶ OK, get your foot under you. We're going to count to three, ready? 1. 2. 3! Good, good, good, OK, you got this. I've got you. You're OK. ¶ You're OK. You're OK, I've got you. We're almost there. Almost there. I got you. ¶ Let's go. ¶ We hope you have all been enjoying today's festivities. One thing has become apparent during this revolution of ours. Only the strong will survive. With this in mind, your friends at The Unknown have arranged a game of death for your entertainment. Enjoy. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ Thank you for calling Emergency Services. We are currently experiencing a higher than normal call volume and have put you in a queue. You are currently sixteenth in line. Your estimated wait time is eleven minutes. Fuck! You should just try again. ¶ Mom, try again, I mean maybe it was just down for a moment. Quiet Tim! I just need a second to think, OK? ¶ People of Aspen Ridge. We at the Lakeview Lutheran Church are taking a group of injured people to the hospital. If you need help, come quickly. Just wait here, OK? We will be back to offer more aid later this afternoon. Please. Can we help you? Please, I need your help! My son, he needs to go to the hospital and I need to find my daughter! We can help. We have room for two more souls. Thank you! Thank you so much. You're good people. Where will you take him? Holy Cross and we'll have your son call as soon as we deliver him. And we can have someone help you get him out of the car in just a moment. Thank you. We're not very religious people, we're more spiritual but if we could donate to your church or maybe volunteer at an event you're having. Aiding people in a time of need is its own reward. If you want to just wait with your son a moment while we make room for this gentleman. ¶ You could have killed him! You almost killed him! What is she talking about Ma'am? Ma'am? She did it! She stabbed Lewis! What is she talking about Ma'am? Ma'am? You almost killed him! Somebody do something! Ma'am, get back here right now! She did it! She stabbed Lewis! Somebody do something! Stop Mom, who are these people? Mom, stop, that's Alice! No! ¶ License plate EWR-032. Echo. Whiskey. Romeo. She assaulted this poor man! ¶ You shouldn't have put that knife in my purse, Tim. You shouldn't have done that. Why is this happening? We have to deal with all of that later, OK? We just need to get Maddie. I think Luther's house is just around the corner. I can't believe this. I can't believe any of this. We'll get through this, OK? We just need to push on. ¶ This is it. This is Lucifer. Luther's place. ¶ I think I'm pretty high from these pills. Yeah. Sorry about that. Two likely would have done the trick. Are you still in pain, though? No. I feel like one big puffy cloud. ¶ What's this for? In case you need to defend yourself while I'm in there. Not sure what I'd do with this considering I couldn't find a use for a meat tenderizer. I think you did pretty good. ¶ Did I kill him? No Honey, no, I did. You just, you saved my life. Mom, what if you don't come back? Well, then you call your Auntie Heather, OK? She'll take care of you. But what if you die in there? No, Tim! We can't think like that, OK? - But- - No, OK? ¶ Do you remember that road trip we took to Grandma Nancy's when you were young? You were little. You were just five. Maddie would have been seven. It was our first time ever going through the mountains with you kids. You kept making us stop everywhere so you could pick rocks. Do you remember that? You guys must have had ten pounds of rocks back there with you. Do you remember what happened next? No. Not really. We were just in the middle of nowhere. It started to rain and it was dark. So dark. That kind of dark you only get when you're miles away from anything. ¶ We rounded this corner and we saw all these flashing lights. So, we pulled over to see what was going on and as we rolled down the windows you could hear this horrible moaning and this woman crying. And then you saw it first but we realized there was this deer that had crashed through the windshield and was pinning the woman to her seat. You jumped out of the car and Maddie followed and I just had to console you two while your dad helped the woman out. And we stayed with her as she waited for help and the whole time that deer was just making the most horrible noise. This moan, it just echoed. And you kids were just begging us, begging us to do something, and there was just nothing that we could do, you know? Your Dad and I were just trying to tell you that it was the deer's time to pass and then the deer, it got like a second wind it just started like kicking madly. It kicked so hard and it like lifted itself up, right out of the windshield and then just bounded off into the woods. We were all watching it run away when Maddie- Maddie said something I'll never forget. She said- "Good creatures don't die so easy." ¶ So, you're the good creature? I hope so, Tim. I hope so. ¶ OK. ¶ Wish me luck. Good luck. ¶ Shhhhh! I am not here to hurt you, OK? I'm not here to hurt you. Then why, why are you here? My daughter Maddie. Madison Edwards, is she here? Madison, she's in the basement. Did he do this to you? Yes he did! ¶ Has he hurt Maddie? Has he hurt my daughter? I don't know. I heard screaming. He just made a mistake. He's young. Please, please don't hurt my son. ¶ ¶ ¶ OK, OK, OK, OK. ¶ ¶ ¶ OK. ¶ Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the inaugural Red Letter Day presented to you by your friends at The Unknown. I have a very special treat for you lucky viewers. I'm your host with the most, Kyrpto, and for those of you who haven't heard my name believe me, after today you will, because you are about to bear witness to the first ever live-streamed Red Letter Day death. Lucky, lucky. The fuck? ¶ OK, OK, down, down. It's gone, Luther, it's gone. Just put the gun down, Luther, please. Doesn't this makes things a little more interesting. It's going to be OK, just stay calm. How do you feel about me killing someone who was inside you? Luther, please, you don't need to do this, just put the gun down. Shut the fuck up! I know. Let's ask the people. This is a democracy after all. Right babe? What do you say, cyberspace? Should I kill both of these lovely ladies? Holy fuck, look at those numbers. I guess that settles it. Shut the fuck up! Looks like we've got ourselves a double whammy! Why are you doing this, why? I'm not doing this, we all are. Look at you, I see the fucking blood on you. This is a fucking revolution lady, and we all know revolution can't happen without people's hands getting a little fucking dirty. I've got a feeling this scene, this fucking scene is gonna be quite popular. Now, stop! I don't have another pair of handcuffs so if you don't mind, I'm gonna kill you right now. Please, no, please! ¶ No, no, no! ¶ Oh fuck, this is so easy. I don't know, I can't shoot both of you, that seems kind of fucking cheap, what do you think? ¶ I know, let's ask the viewers to help us pick something a little more interesting. Hey babe? ¶ Help us folks. We've got death by blade, ahhhhh, death by fucking strangulation, no, fuck that, that's stupid. ¶ I know, let's have a, a mother/daughter game of Russian Roulette. Fuck, that's good. ¶ Ahhhhh! Holy fuck, I need a doctor. You were gonna kill my child. Live on the internet? Well, no, I wasn't. ¶ It's OK baby, it's OK. This will all be over soon. Mom. Ahhhhhh. Oh shit. How many people are watching this? ¶ Two million. Two million people were gonna watch you kill my daughter? You were gonna watch him slaughter my child? Why? Why would you wanna see this? Mom, I just wanna go home. Please just take me home. Soon, Baby. She was gonna call the cops! She was gonna tell them everything! You were going to kill my baby! Put the gun down Mom. What were you thinking? Mom, please! Why were you doing this? You filled people with paranoia. You caused them to kill. You caused good people to murder! We just sent the letters, you did the rest. ¶ Please don't, no. Now, get up. Give me the key to her handcuffs. You're not going to kill me? And give those sickos the satisfaction? ¶ You are not lucky enough to die today. ¶ Asshole. ¶ Pick yourself up. ¶ You tell me everything you know about this shit. I can't. ¶ I can't, the Unknown will kill me. Do I look like I give a fuck about The Unknown? Now start talking. ¶ ¶ ¶ What's the ice scraper for? To punish older sisters who try and sneak out of the house. ¶ Are you OK? Yeah, other than a fucked up leg and a lifetime of nightmares, I'm fine. Oh my God! It's pretty gross, hey? Does that hurt? No. I'm pretty messed up on pills. Are you OK? Yeah, I think so. ¶ I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for leaving you, Tim. I know you are, Maddie. It's OK. What a fucking day. Alright, buckle up. ¶ ¶ We may have done some bad things today, but we're not bad people. Remember that, OK? ¶ We just did what we had to do to survive, and we came out alive, not everyone was so lucky. ¶ So, what do we do now? I don't know, but whatever it is, we do it together, OK? You got it? Got it. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶
