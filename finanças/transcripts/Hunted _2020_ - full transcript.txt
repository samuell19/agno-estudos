Do you hear that, Jeremy? Hear what? The song of the forest? Hey, I can hear it now. That's the Wolf Girl who sings. This story begins a long, a long time ago. A priest named Nicodemus decided to raise an army of paupers in order to liberate the Holy Land of Jerusalem. Nicodemus managed to convince a large number of peasants and other hopeless souls to follow him to Christ's tomb. He soon had 100 followers. From whence they made their way across the country towards Jerusalem. But soon, food became scarce. Then winter set in, harsh and punishing. They starved to death one by one. Only a handful entered the forest. This very forest in fact. Back then, giant wolves ran wild. But Nicodemus was unconcerned. He proclaimed an angel visited him in a dream and told him this was the shortest route to do God's bidding. "Onwards!" Starved and desperate, Nicodemus saw a young girl, flesh that would serve a sustenance for his hungry followers. She begged him to let her go. Silence, woman."Silence woman. You will fulfill the will of God. Now pray for salvation." The young girl's beautiful and pure song had awoken the forest, and it wished to protect her. The forest was a defender of the innocent, that is, when it sends its emissaries. Aah! Seeing the girl on the back of a huge wolf, Nicodemus shouted, "Witch, you're a witch! You're safe because you've mated with Beelzebub." The girl responded, "The company of wolves is better than that of man." - You're going to die witch. - "You're going to die witch." She disappeared forever in the forest. Are there still wolves, mummy? Wolves? No. No, there aren't. As for man? Yes, there are. We have deadlines for a reason, Eve. You can't let these motherfuckers get away with this. I know, and I told them, but they have a problem with the delivery. What can I do? You need to put your foot down, you need to put pressure on these guys. But that's what I'm doing, and I think they're reliable. You need to be tougher, otherwise this is all going to blow up in our faces, we'll all be fucked. If you want, I can put Martin on this. He's right here. Hey. Hi. He can be there tomorrow if you want. No. Thank you, but I'll handle it myself tomorrow. Make sure you do. I don't like to be disappointed. Bye. Bye. Hello? No, I couldn't call you back. I had a shitty day. Stop it with the apartment. I don't know, I don't know. Let's talk about it when I get back, okay? Yeah. Bye. No-one ever dared give an order in my presence. Well, it's only the first time. You have a strange power over me. Whether it's love or not, I don't know. And you know what I want, is just to be with you. That's the way I like it, don't you? What can I get you? Uh, can I have a mojito? Here you are. Thank you. Welcome. Are you my date? No. I'm kidding. A-ha. May I offer you a drink? I think I'm fine, thank you. Let me guess, you're Russian? No. Polish? French. Ah. Aren't you that French actress or something? No. You look sad. How about we get back to my place? Look, that's enough. Okay, okay. Just talking, right? Who do you think you are? Miss Universe? Aah. Hey, it's time to give up. You're bothering her. Uh, no, I'm not. Thank you very much. Two more, for me and my girl. You okay? Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. What a asshole. Yeah, obviously, that's... Two mojitos. May I offer you a drink? Why not, yeah. It's from the asshole. Right. Thanks. What did you say to him? I told him to change his deodorant. Yeah, right. Mm-hmm. What are you doing in this fantastic place? Um, I came to supervise a construction project in the area, and tonight I needed to get some fresh air, have a drink, so I ended up here. And you? Oh, well, I, uh... You're here to dance? I saw you. You're a natural. Oh, you haven't seen anything yet. Really? Yeah, I can do the splits. No, I'm here to see my brother. He's not in a great place right now. His girlfriend just died... cancer. Oh, I'm sorry. That's life. I'll buy the next round if you want. You've got killer moves. Oh, come on. No, really. That was some serious dancing. Uh... Come. Are you okay? Did I do something wrong? Uh, what are you guys doing? What took you so long? Oh, oh, oh. W-What's happening here? We had to get out of there, right? That place sucked. I know a much better place. But we never said that. W-Where are we going? Calm down. Don't get all worked up, man. Hey, I'm not worked up. Just take me back, okay? Jesus. Make up your mind already. Look, it was fun, but you have to take me back because I have work tomorrow. I work tomorrow, too, alright? We can have one last drink back home, and then we'll have a little fun all together, you know? What do you mean all together? You know, the three of us. What? What? With your brother? I'm not his brother. Okay, what the fuck is this? Stop the car! Let me out! Child lock, sorry. Stop the car! Aah! You fucking stop the car now! Yeah, we'll let you out. We're not crazy. Stop it! Yeah, we'll stop. Alright, stop the car, stop the car. The lady gets off here. Bye. Hi. Can I make a phone call? I forgot my phone, and I would like to call a taxi. A taxi? You're not going to get a taxi now at this hour. Fuck. If you'd like, I close up here in about 20 minutes, I could drop you off back in town? Yeah, that would be awesome. Thank you. In the meantime, feel free to check out our wide range of products for young and old alike, everything made in that great empire of China. They're going to be our next masters of the world, you know? Yeah, I know. And when that happens, I'll be ready. Hello, little girl. I am very sweet, and I love little sluts like you. Leave me alone. Stop it, Andy. I told you to be polite. I'm so sorry. Could you shut up, little bitch, please? No, I told you not to talk like that to the lady, Andy! I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. I need to teach him manners, but he's not listening. Is there a problem, Miss? Is this guy bothering you? Oh, man, we're together. Tell him, honey. Oh, come on, you can't leave me like this. You're breaking my heart. Listen, man, this probably isn't the best place to resolve this kind of issue. I love her. No really, I do. Uh... you're right. I'm being an idiot. No, don't be so hard on yourself, man. Look, look, uh, Confucius once said, "Our greatest glory is not to fall but to know how to rise each time we fall." Think about that. I mean, you know, just take some time off, reflect on that. - Thank you, sir. - Hey. You're very kind. I'll... I'll stop calling you. I'll give you some space. You can call me when you feel like it. May I use your restroom? Maybe you should try talking to him. You know, he looks like he really is suffering. We need to go. What the hell? All good? Sorry. Did I take too long? Do you want to keep little Andy? No? Are you hungry? Ooh, I love these! Lots of cash. Look at that. Vodka. Let's go. The night is young. No. No? Y-you don't want to? Move it. What are you going to do with me? Nothing. Get in. Please, let me go, please, please. Please? Grab her hands. Alright, what's wrong? You look sad. What, she's not hot enough for you? You want us to find another girl? Come on, you know you can tell me anything, spit it out. I don't think I can do this. I don't feel very well. I think you can do this. I know you can. And I'm counting on you. We're a team, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. I think it's wrong. It's all right. Everybody gets cold feet. I have exactly what you need in case you feel a little shy. Viagra. Even porn stars use this. Really? Of course. What do you think? Imagine, you're on set, the whole crew's ready to shoot, right? This bitch is lying there with her legs spread open, then this guy appears, and he goes, "Hey, everyone, uh, I'm sorry, I don't think I can get it up today. Must be something I ate." Pbht! Imagine that? Cinema is a huge business. It's efficiency at all costs. There's no place for amateurs. We have to stay focused. Say it. Focus, focus. Again. Focus, focus, focus. Repeat it. Focus, focus, focus. That's it, louder. Focus, focus, focus. - Yes! - Focus! Focus! Focus! - Hello? - Mm! Mm! What are you doing? Do you like that music, b... I don't have AIDS, you know? What's your problem? Do I disgust you? Does my mouth disgust you? No, not at all. Then why did you wipe the bottle before drinking? Just, just habit. I... So I don't disgust you? - No, not at all. - Uh-huh. You love me? What? Do you fucking love me? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, kiss me then. What? Kiss me, now! Fuck! My stomach. Something's stuck in my stomach. How many times have I told you to put your seatbelt on? Get out of the car. I'm stuck. I need your help to get out. What are you doing? Covering our tracks. Wait a minute! Let's go. Right this way. Move it! Come on! Come on, move it! Aah! Oh, come on. We were just fucking with you. You know you're gonna catch a cold like this? Fuck. Listen! Right there, right there! Come on! Faster! Get her! Aah! You fucking moron! Fuck! Ah! - Yeah, the camera loves you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. Show me your biggest, most beautiful smile. - Alright, now show me fear. - Like... Oh! I don't know, I get a... I don't know. Oh! Man, I want to go. Let me go, man! Let me go! Don't move, don't move. Ah, now she's crying. Oh, for fuck's sake. Andy, come get the camera. Fucking whining all the time. I did everything you told me to. Fuck, you spread them. Spread your fucking legs! Come on! You're slowing us down. We'll never find her in here. We need to get as far away as possible. I need stitches. Did she see our faces? Yes. Well, haven't you ever watched TV? In the foster home, that's all I ever did. All right. So, in order to catch her, we have to get inside her head, to think like her. So, I'm a little bitch lost in the woods, and I know I'm going to die soon. What do I do? I don't know. No? I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do 'cause I'm scared shitless! Let me have a look. Ah! Does that hurt? Yes! Alright, sit down. Alright. Okay, hold it here. Hold it. Alright. All fixed up. Aah. Feeling better? Yes. Thank you very much. You see? No need for a hospital. Come on. Let's go. Ooh! Oh! It's freezing. You should try it. It's good for circulation. Want one? No. Hey. Hey. Grab her. Fucking grab her. Go! Fuck! Grab her, you moron! Please. Just stop. Aah! Oh! - Get up! - Aah! Fucking bitch. Aaah! Fuck! Fuck! Are you crying? Shut up, Andy. First you make me crash the car, then you let her get away. You're a useless piece of shit. I shouldn't have talked to you like that. I'm sorry. I'll never call you Andy again. It's just, I'm a little tense with everything that's going on. I take care of you, right? I take care of you. Come on. Alright, breathe. Let me have a look at your face. It... it's just a broken nose. Okay? Yes, yes, it's... All right, we'll get you to a hospital, but right now we have to strap the nose. Okay. And that way, you don't end up looking like a freak. Girls don't like freaks, you know? It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine. Sit down. Did I tell you I used to be a first responder? Yeah. You wouldn't believe the wounds I've seen. This is nothing. Just a scratch. Yeah. You'll look sexier in the end. Yeah. I'm not joking. Women, they love men who look like they've been through shit, you know? Alright. Okay, this is gonna sting, but you're brave, alright? - Yeah. - Okay, hold it right here. Okay. I'm going to strap the nose. Aah! I know. I know. I know. Alright, we got to strap it tight. That way, it doesn't get infected, okay? Alright? I'll make a hole over the mouth afterwards, but there's a lot of dangerous bacteria in this forest, right? And if you get an infection, oh, boy. You could get tetanus. Do you want to know why you ended up with duct tape on your face, Andy? Lack of motivation. You're lazy, incompetent, and you complain about everything. It's all right. I forgive you. Boy? Hey. I need help. Hey. Oh, my God. Finally another human being. I was hiking with some friends. No, that's shit. I've been lost for two days. I was walking my dog Andy, and he ran off to chase rabbits and so I ran after him. He ran off... so I had to run after him. Hi! I've been lost for a while. I was, uh, walking with my dog Andy. Always alert. That's my son Jeremy. - Hi. - You can use his phone. Huh? You need to call someone, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I... I should call my wife. She must be worried sick. Hey, honey, it's me. Yeah no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. I... I swear, I'm fine. Please, listen. Andy ran off, so I chased him. But I got lost in the woods, so... No, I couldn't find him. I'm sorry, baby. I-I met some very nice people, and... and they're going to help me. What time are you heading back? Nightfall. Alright, I'll... I'll be with you tonight. I'm sorry for Andy, baby. Yeah. I love you. I-I should hang up now. See you tonight. Thanks. No problem. Women. Never get married. Can I help with anything? No. What are you doing? Watching porn, huh? No, no. I'm playing video games. Hey, it's fine by me. So what? You're watching porn. There's no shame in that. Look, I totally understand. There's so many sluts around. I'm just playing video games, that's all. You gay? No, I like girls. I got some great movies I can show you if you want. When those girls scream, they're not acting. All right. Our little secret, yeah? This is very good. Thanks. What breed is your dog? Huh? Your dog. The one that's lost in the wood. What breed is it? Oh. I... I don't know actually. It's a bastard, I guess. His name was Andy. He was a little dumb, but I liked him a lot. Yeah. You might find him again. I doubt it. What are you doing out here, camping? We're preparing for the end of the world. We're training to survive in a hostile environment. Yeah, basically we sleep badly and eat uncooked meat. You'll see. One day all of this will be of use. Yeah, can't wait. Do you live in the area? No. No, um... My wife and I, we're just, you know, tourists visiting Europe. A tourist with a dog? Yeah. It's not forbidden, is it? No. I got to take a leak. And what is it you do? Besides walking your dog in the wilderness? I make movies. Documentaries mostly. Aaah! How's that for a hostile environment? - Paranoid bitch. - Aah! Do you want to be my friend? Mm-hmm. Cool. I need help. Wakey, wakey. - Come back! - Aah! Where are you going? Come on, I have a movie to shoot, and I don't have fucking day! Come on! You're sending some very bad vibes into my mood, you understand that? This entire forest is filling up with negative energy, and it's seriously getting on my fucking nerves! Let me introduce Andy, your partner for the scene today. Alright, here you go. Put the mask on. But I... I did everything you told me to. Put the fucking mask on. Now. Do you see what I have to deal with? Complaining all the time. So, here's the pitch. You're a rebel fighting for the occupation. That's gonna be good, right? The war's been going on for months, and you haven't touched a woman since. You're walking in this forest, you're lost. And you're thinking, "Man, what I wouldn't give for a nice little piece of pussy." When suddenly, you stumble upon this... this camp site. And you find this CIA spy in hiding. She... she's a spy. You caught her, you tied her to the tree. And you know she has some crucial information you have to get out of her. Oh, man. Oh, that's a great story. They just pop into my head. I don't have to do anything. They come to me just like that. So, you walk up to her, and you start feeling her up a little bit, but she's all uptight. You know, one of those, "I don't go all the way on a first date." You know what I mean? And then when you're good and hard, you grab her by the hair, and you stick it in her mouth. You ready? Alright. Wait! I didn't say "action." Don't move until I say "action." Alright. Action. Holy shit! Aah! Fuck! What the fuck?! No, no! Aah! Get it off me! Fuck, fuck! What the fuck?! Do something for fuck's sake! Oh, fuck off! Aah! Fuck, my camera! My baby! Ah! Fuck! No, don't be... You're fucking dead. Leave her alone! Fuck off! Aah! Jesus! Jesus Christ! Mum? Mum? Mum. Aah! I'm gonna fuck you now. Not sure you can. What did you say? Aah. Little dick. Aah! I'm the best fuck you'll ever have. Aah! Aaah! No, no, no. Aah! Oh, yeah. Yeah! You hear me bitch?! I'm going to find you, and I'm going to kill you! What? Aaah! Fuck! Fucking forest! Fuck this forest. Andy? Not my friend anymore. I'm not afraid, you fucking bitch! Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shut up! Oh, fuck, it stings. She's not there. Aah! Fucking hurts. Aah! Move it up. Move it up. Move it up here. Move it up. Move it up. Aah! Oh, fuck. Hey! You shouldn't be here! Hey, stop! Aaah! Fuck! God! Listen, dude. I'm trained. I'm going to have to ask you to leave, okay? Can't you see I'm wounded? I need help. Right behind you! Behind you. Hey, what's going on? She's trying to kill me! Do something. Put the club down. Put the club down! Hey! On the floor, now! Do something! Stop! Aaaah! Bitch! Yeah! - Yeah! Way to go man! - On your knees, cowboy! - Alright. - Hey! Come back here, you! Aah! My nose! Fuck. My nose is fucked! Let's have a look at the kitchen, shall we? So what do you think? I'm really not sure. - I think I love it. - Really? Okay, guys, you have to imagine this for yourself. Just dream with me for a sec. It's a wonderful morning. You're having your breakfast. And suddenly, your kid is having his first steps. Yeah. I think I like that. Um, I'm telling you, this is the place to raise a child. - Yeah, I think it is. - Really? Just perfect. What do you reckon? I like it. Oh, my baby! My baby! Do something! Visits are over. You have to apply online, ma'am. What the...? Aah! Aaah! Aah! Wait, wait, let me help you up. Fucking choke you to death. Fucking whore. Aah! Oh, fuck. Aah! Aah! Fuck! Son of a bitch, boy. You can have it. I'm gonna fuck those assholes. Come here, Lobo. Come here, Lobo! Lobo! No, let go! Let go! Aaah! Please! Please, I'm sorry! I'm really sorry. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. I know I caused you a lot of pain. But I sincerely regret it. Alright? Wait. I can change. I'll get some help. Look, I swear. Look, I'll get my demons. Please. Give me another chance. I'm really... Aah! I said I was sorry! I said I was sorry. Aah! I said I was sorry. I said I was sorry. I love you.
