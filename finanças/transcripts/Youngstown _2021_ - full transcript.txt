They accelerate a little bit faster. They're a little bit more dependable. Canfield Fair, what's that? -Obviously you're not from Youngstown. -And why is that? -Everyone from Youngstown knows about the Canfield Fair. -Okay. Sure, Canfield Fair, Ferris wheel, funnel cake, lots of fun, I know the Canfield fair.

I'm trying to get better at lying. The only thing I got down so far is I'm not from Youngstown. -So you are from Youngstown. -No. -Okay, you definitely need to get better at lying. The first thing you need to do is you need to not tell anybody else that you're in the witness protection program, okay? - Right. - Second thing you need to do is you need to change this whole look. You're gonna need to go to the salon. You're gonna need to get your hair done. You're gonna need to get this whole thing completely unrecognizable. Do you think you can do that? -Yeah, that's some good advice there. I like the way you think. -Thank you. -[Sarah] Oh, this is my favorite street. Belmont Avenue in my favorite street. I'm so happy to be back here. -[Grifter] What is Monteen's? -[Sarah] Monteen's is the kind of place you go when it's Friday night, and you're maybe gonna have a nice dinner. Oh, Classic Optical, I got my first pair of glasses there. -[Grifter] You wear glasses? -[Sarah] Not anymore. Goodyear, you can get some tires there. -[Grifter] I know. -[Sarah] That's Arby's, that actually originated here in Youngstown. - Did it? -[Sarah] It was two brothers. They're R and a B, and then it was Arby's. Taco Bell, I got my foot run over in that parking lot. -[Grifter] Wow. -[Sarah] They demolished all that over there. Wow. That used to be BJ's. -[Grifter] Tim Horton's used to be BJ's. -[Sarah] Great rib spot. Yeah, I'm gonna pretend that Tim Horton's doesn't exist. -[Grifter] Hmm. -[Sarah] This is a graveyard on the right. -[Grifter] Wow, look at all those headstones. -[Sarah] I know a lot of people in that graveyard, a lot of family in there. Oh, Plaza Donuts, donuts and coffee, they've got both of them there. -[Grifter] Wow, both. -[Sarah] Blue Ribbon dry cleaners if you need somethin' clean. Do you need anything cleaned? -[Grifter] No. -[Sarah] Golden Hunan, that is my favorite place for Chinese food. Not the original location, that's a second location right there. -[Grifter] Looks good. -[Sarah] Jimmy's, classic Italian food. If you need some Italian food, you go to Jimmy's. -[Grifter] Good to know. -[Sarah] Rally's is new. That did not used to exist. -[Grifter] Oh, some new things poppin' up. -[Sarah] If you need a jersey, you just go over to Wharmby Sports. You need a jersey? - No. -[Sarah] Kravitz Deli, best corned beef you'll ever have. -[Grifter] Kravitz. -[Sarah] That's where the original Hunan was, right where that AutoZone is. -[Grifter] Hmm. -[Sarah] Jim Rohan Floor Covering, they will cover your floors like you would not believe. -[Grifter] Nice. -[Sarah] Touch of Class, if you need to look nice, you go there. -[Grifter] Very nice. -[Sarah] Uptown Pizza, great place for pizza. -[Grifter] Okay. -[Sarah] You like pizza? -[Grifter] It's fine. -[Sarah] Well, you would love their pizza. -[Grifter] So you really know this town. -Yep, and I'm not from Youngstown.

Meet me at Plaza Donuts in two hours. -Okay. -Okay, yeah, right here. Thanks. -Hello. -Hello. -Welcome to New Dawn Salon and Day Spa. How are you today? -Mm. -All right. What can I do for you? -I need to look a little different. -A little different? And what were you thinkin' about doing today? -What if we dye my hair blonde? -Blonde? Mm, that would look pretty. Can I see your hair? Blonde would look nice. So to go blonde all over, we would have to bleach and tone your hair. -Mm-hmm. -All-over bleach and tone for your length of hair would be about $200. -What if we just do the bangs? - Just the bangs? - Mm. -And you wanna do them blonde? Um, I would say that we could bleach and tone your bangs for 50. -Let's do just the bangs. -Okay, we do have someone available that could do that for you today. -Yeah. -All right, I'll grab her for you. We have a waiting area over there that you could go ahead and have a seat, and she'll be right with you. Sounds good? [faint upbeat music] -Hi. How are you? -I'm good. -Good, so what are we doin' today? -We are dying my bangs blonde. -Your bangs? -Yeah. -Okay. [gentle music] My name's Kelly, by the way. What's yours? -My name's Sarah Jayne. -Sarah Jayne? Well, nice to meet you, Sarah Jayne. [curious lighthearted music] Come on over here. [laughs] I'll be back for you in 20 minutes. [moves to suspenseful music] We're gettin' you pretty blonde, girl. Just be a few more minutes. [soft music] [moves to peculiar music] [curious lighthearted music] All right, I think we're ready. Come on over, we'll shampoo you. [moves to suspenseful music] [Kelly speaking faintly] [birds cawing] [distant traffic rushing] [horn blaring] [tires screeching] What do you think? -I love it. -Looks good. -Thank you. -Thank you. Have a good day. - Hey girl. - Hey. -How'd that go? -I mean, it was interesting. -I can tell. I'm a little concerned about her and her, "Just do my bangs." -[Kelly] Yeah, it's definitely a different look, so. -[Receptionist] Yeah, I hope she's gonna be okay. -[Kelly] Yeah. [Sarah humming] [bell dinging] [bell dinging] -Excellent, unrecognizable. -Great. I like your outfit too. -Just got it. -You want one? -No, I'm okay. -I love Plaza Donuts. I haven't been back here since high school. -Mm-hmm. -I miss that place. The smell of library books, lockers, hallways. -Okay. Okay, we can work with that. Here, come with me. [bell jingling] Come on. Okay, ever seen these before? -Yeah. -Uh, you just might need these now. -But I can walk just fine. -No, you can't. Okay? Now, this is what's known as a visual lie, okay. There are two types of lies. There are verbal lies, and there are visual lies, okay? Now, what travels faster than the sound of a lie entering your ear hole is gonna be the look of a lie entering your eyeballs, okay? You're gonna be walking around on these crutches. - Okay. - Okay? People are gonna see you comin' in so red-hot clankety-clank crutching that even the sound of the crutching is, they know that you're crutching long before they could even possibly even hear it, okay? This is basic walking. It looks like it hurts, doesn't it? -Yeah. -That's a great visual lie. Okay? - Okay. - Now, once you get good enough at these, you're gonna wanna use these like a new appendage. You're gonna be at the grocery store. You're gonna be saying to yourself, uh, I would love for somebody to reach up and grab me those sweet cookie bars. Now, you're gonna reach up, and you're gonna point and say, "Oh, please, somebody, do that for me. Somebody, please bring that down. I would be so grateful." Guess what? They're not just gonna hand you the cookies. They're gonna buy the cookies for you. They're gonna take you home, and they're gonna give you a glass of milk to put the cookies in, okay? - Wow. - Now, that, if you can tell a visual lie good enough, then the verbal lies start pouring out right after that. - Okay. - Okay? -So who are we lying to? -[Grifter] Now, what you've gotta do is you've got to go to a place where people recognize you. - Okay. - Because if your lies can convince them, then you can convince anybody. -[Sarah] Okay, I got. -[Grifter] So this is your high school? -[Sarah] Yeah, look at that. Isn't it beautiful? -[Grifter] It's pretty good. -[Sarah] It's the same color outside, you know, that didn't change. -All right, here are these beautiful crutches. This is for you. You know what to do. -I mean, yeah. It's easy. -Remember, what you're doin' in there is visual. -Okay. Oh man, it feels great to be back here. Gosh. This way. Love these lockers. They repainted 'em. They still look really good. Oh, the clock's the same. I love it here. It just feels so good. You know, I feel like I can really breathe again. You know, we gotta check out the library. That's where we're gonna go next. -What happened to you? -Oh, she, uh, busted her ankle playin' basketball. -Oh, that sucks. I hope you get better. -Thanks. -Basketball. It's that easy. When we get to the library, you do the next one, okay? -Okay. [Sarah humming] -Hi. Can I help you? -Yeah. I was just walkin' down the street, and I saw a squirrel. So I stopped, and then I looked over, and there was a banana peel. I slipped right on it. -Wow, sorry to hear that. -Yeah, it's okay though. It's healing. -Okay, well, let me know if there's anything I can do for ya. -Okay. I love this library. -Well, thank you. -Yeah. [Sarah humming] Mm. [Sarah inhales deeply] [bell dings] Lie, a false statement or action, especially one made with intent to deceive, anything that gives or is meant to give a false impression. -Oh, green book, blue book. Black book, brown book. Okay, books, books. So many books. [Sarah humming] -Did you find what you were looking for? -I did, right here. My yearbook, class of '05. That's me. - Wow. -[Grifter] Pretty good. -[Librarian] Yeah, got your haircut. -[Grifter] I sure did. - That's great. - That's it. -So what brings ya back here? -[Grifter] I, uh, I'm actually just passing through. -[Librarian] Oh wow, where do you live now? -[Grifter] I live in Mission Falls, Wisconsin. -[Librarian] Huh, I don't think I've heard of that. - Well-- - What do you do there? -Uh, I actually just opened up a bowling alley. It's booming. I have a beautiful three-year-old son. He's great. His name is Thomas. He's bouncing around like a little baby. You know what I mean? - Oh, that's great. -[Grifter] This kid just finally got out of diapers. He's completely potty trained. - Great. -[Grifter] So when I saw this kid gettin' potty trained, I'm thinkin' to myself, this kid just took the first step towards complete independence. - Yeah. -[Grifter] And now I'm sendin' him off to the bowling alley. This kid cleans the balls. This kid's washin' the dirty rags that the bowlers use when they're wipin' off their hands after greasing 'em up to stick 'em in the three holes of the bowling balls. - Oh. - Okay. And these guys come in with these custom balls, and my kid loves these custom balls. Some of 'em have smiley faces on 'em. Some of 'em have, I don't know, like a bunch of swirly designs on 'em. - Wow. - Some of the swirly designs, I'm talkin' about beautiful things here. They look like dang tie-dyed T-shirts, okay. - Is that right? - That's right. -Well, that's fantastic. Well, I'm glad you stopped in. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. -Thank you very much. - All right, have a good day. - Buh-bye. -[Librarian] Bye. -Man, he's good. [lighthearted music] They totally believed me. -[Grifter] Congratulations, no more crutches. You've graduated. -[Sarah] Great. -[Grifter] But you know, with great lies comes great responsibility. -[Sarah] Yeah. Did I tell you these ribs are to die for? -You did. [lighthearted music continues] A full rack in 10 minutes, that's pretty good for me. -I told you, to die for. -Look at this construction site over here. That's a 20-man crew. That's a big operation. They're puttin' somethin' big up in here. This is gonna be a new hotspot. I can feel it. -I've always loved this area. -Somethin' big is comin' up. -Yeah? -Yeah, you like this area. People like this area. It's cyclical. Now we're fed, there anything else to do around here? -Oh yeah, there's a million things to do in Youngstown. It's really action-packed place. This neighborhood is amazing. Look at these houses. Beautiful, I'd love to have one of these houses. -Yeah, these houses are pretty good. - Man, look at that garden. -Beautiful flowers, beautiful color, like a dirty green. -Yeah, dirty green. -Hey, what do you see right here? -[Sarah] That one's for sale. -[Grifter] By owner, okay. Not by professionals. - Okay. -Now, these homeowners, they don't know how to sell houses. - Right. -They have no idea what they're doing. A professional would get in there, make a million phone calls, sell that house 25% over market value, make this homeowner a ton of money. Now, I look at this house, and I see a ton of potential. - Yeah. - But this homeowner's gonna sell this house, no way. [scoffs] This guy put his phone number out here. He doesn't know what he's doing. You gotta make calls, not receive calls. I mean, come on, look at that big, beautiful brown house. Now, I don't make the rules. - Yeah. - But from the moment that for sale sign went onto that lawn, there is a grace period where anybody can go in. -Mm. -Hmm? -What are you talkin' about? -[exhales] Okay, come on. I'm talking about getting in there, setting up shop, helping these good people out by selling their house. These people need help, okay, and we can do that. -So do you think they left a key for us or something or- -Maybe. Well, that's locked, no key. - Okay. - Great shrubs. Great mulch. Nice garage for a nice white truck. [door creaking] Okay. - Oh wow. - Okay, okay. -[Sarah] So they just left it unlocked for us. -[Grifter] Well, they left it unlocked because of the grace period. -[Sarah] Oh. Okay. - You know, these people know what they're doin'. -Whoa. I mean, that is such a great thing. -I know. -[Sarah] Youngstown really knows how to treat a person, huh? -[Grifter] Love that. -Wow, I'm finally home. -Okay, don't forget, we gotta sell this thing. Oh my god, you gotta see this upstairs. It's like a tiny little room, but it's great. -[Sarah] Ooh, let me check that out. -[Grifter] Okay, choose your room. -[Sarah] Oh, yeah, this one's my room, the one downstairs. That's my bedroom. -[Grifter] Okay, I got this upstairs. This is where I'm gonna be sleeping, and you're probably not allowed up here. [gentle music] -I love Youngstown. These are the kind of mornings I'm talking about. It's pleasant. The sun is shining. I finally feel like myself. -Blue skies. - Yeah. - Oh, look at that barbell cloud. -[Sarah] Whoa. -[Grifter] I would love to see, like, a giant pump that. -[Sarah] Yeah, that would be, that would be amazing. -[Grifter] That would be cool. See him start to sweat 'cause he's pumping it so hard, and then it rains. [Sarah humming] -Yeah, it's a great day. Wow. -[Grifter] Beautiful day. -[Sarah] I love it here. -This is a great neighborhood. -It's a great neighborhood. The air here is better. -Pretty good. -It's excellent. -Yeah. This is a great kid. -That's a great kid. - I love his look. - Yeah. -[Grifter] He's got this classic kid look. - Yeah. - You know? -[Sarah] He's probably really friendly. -[Grifter] Right. -[Sarah] This kid knows how to ride a bicycle. -[Grifter] You got that right. -[Sarah] This is the kind of neighborhood I'm talkin' about. - Yeah, kids on bikes. - Yeah. -[Grifter] This is truly a great kid. -Yeah, this kid's great. I mean, we have to say hello. Howdy, neighbor! It's pretty, pretty outside, huh? -Did you just move in here? -Yes, and we love this house. Yeah. -My best friend used to live here. -[Grifter] Well, what if we're your new best friend? -You're too old to be my best friend. -Well, this is Youngstown, baby. Ain't nobody too old around here. -Okay. -[Grifter] Do you think we could really be his best friend? -[Sarah] We could be anybody's best friend. -To be honest, knowing that that kid is in this neighborhood makes me feel really good. -Yeah. [bee buzzing] Wow! [laughs] It's just a bee. -Hmm. [wind chimes tinkling] [dog barking] [rooster crows] -We got a potential buyer. -Hi, I was just in the neighborhood here and... Um, oh. -Hi, howdy, how are ya? [clears throat] Would you like a tour of this house? It's beautiful inside. - One second. - I would love to give you a tour. -One second. Yeah, uh, somebody just came out of the house here offering to give me a tour. And who, who are you, honey? -We are the professionals selling this house. -She said that they were the professionals, and they're sellin' the house. I'm not understandin'. I see. -There are things about this house that you really can't see until you go right on in there, so if you get in there- -Okay, honey, he just told me that you weren't supposed to be here, so what, what kind of operation is this? - There's a grace period where the house is open, and you can live there. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, she said that there's a grace period. - So that's what we did. And we're selling this- -Grace period's over! - What, what, hold on. - What do you mean? -Um, um, you know what- -Time to go! -Okay, um, enjoy the house. It was lovely meeting you. - Get in this truck. - Is the house still for sale? -Wait, what do you mean the grace period's over? -[Grifter] It just ended. -I loved talking to you! - I see. - Congratulations. You just sold your first house. -Tell me more about this, uh, grace period. They mentioned something about a grace period. -[Sarah] So she's gonna buy that house, you think? -[Grifter] Oh, I know a buyer when I see a buyer. She's already probably signing the paperwork as we speak. -[Sarah] Oh, okay. I really love that house. -[Grifter] So what else do you like to do in this town? -[Sarah] Oh, well, there's my best friend's house. -[Grifter] Okay, what's your best friend like? -[Sarah] She's nice, smart, and funny. She's a friend of the family. -[Grifter] Hmm, nice, smart, and funny. Well, I would love to meet her. -[Sarah] Okay. Isn't Lala's house great? -[Grifter] You said her name is Lala? -[Sarah] Yeah, Lala. -[Grifter] Well, how do you and this Lala know each other? -[Sarah] Oh, her parents died in a car bomb. -[Grifter] Car bomb? -[Sarah] Yeah, so my great-grandmother took her in. She was like a sister to my mother. She's been my best friend my entire life. -[Grifter] Car bomb? Ooh-la-la. -[Sarah] Come on, you're gonna love her. -[Grifter] I believe that. [doorbell chiming] [Lala speaking in foreign language] [Sarah sighs] [Lala speaking in foreign language] [Sarah speaking in foreign language] [Lala speaking in foreign language] [Sarah speaking in foreign language] [Lala speaking in foreign language] [Sarah speaking in foreign language] [Lala speaking in foreign language] [Sarah speaking in foreign language] -What are you guys talkin' about? -She asked if you were my boyfriend. -She did? -Now, I want you to tell her that you're not my type. -Mm-hmm. -But that she definitely is my type. And whatever language it is you guys are talkin' in, I want you to say that with the utmost sincerity. -I speak English, and thanks for the compliment, but I like men a little more mature. Let's go have a drink. Come on. Anybody wants coffee and Kahlua? So what are you doing in Youngstown? -Went to the salon, sold a house, been walkin' on crutches. -Crutches? You're not hurt, are you? -No. I've been practicing lying. -Well, good, because you are a terrible liar. - Yeah. -You're not going to Canfield Fair, are you? -No. I'm thinkin' about movin' back here though. -[Lala] I would like to see you more, but what would you do in Youngstown? -Mm, Bob offered me a job. -Really? -[Sarah] Yeah. -Bob? -Yeah. -[Lala] Really? -Yeah. -Well, just be safe. -Okay. -And cheers to Mama. -To Mama. -To Mama. [cups clinking] - To Mama. [gentle music] Oh, we got it.

[Sarah speaks foreign language] Bye, honey. -Such a pleasure. -Bye. -Okay. Can I kiss you right now? -Well, the real man isn't gonna ask. -You're the best. -Bye. [soft curious music] -This place is really fun. I grew up here. -You grew up here? -[Sarah] Yeah, just playin' around in the scraps. -[Grifter] You played around in scraps growin' up? -[Sarah] Yeah, it's a scrapyard. These machines, they're huge. - Yeah. -There's so many different things to look at. -[Grifter] Huh, that's a big, beautiful crane. -[Sarah] Mm-hmm. -[Grifter] Oh, check that out. They're goin' up a huge conveyor belt. -[Sarah] Sorting metals. They got these claws, you see. -[Grifter] The purpose of a claw is to grab the metal, crunch the metal, toss the metal onto the huge heap? -[Sarah] Yeah. -[Grifter] And you make a ton of money like that? -[Sarah] Yeah. -[Grifter] Okay, now we're talkin'. So what was that cheers to Mama. Who's Mama? -[Sarah] She's my great-grandmother. She's my favorite person in the whole entire world. -Wow, big compliment, and who... What is all this stuff about Bob? Who's Bob? -[Sarah] He's a friend of the family. -[Grifter] This is his scrapyard? -[Sarah] Yeah, this is Bob's place. -[Grifter] And we're here to see Bob 'cause Bob offered you a job? -[Sarah] Yeah, Bob offered me a job. -[Grifter] You think Bob would offer me a job? -[Sarah] Probably, Bob is really nice. -[Grifter] I don't want a real job, just somethin' I could do for like a week. -[Sarah] That'd be cool. -[Grifter] I don't really like to stick around any jobs too long. But I'm lookin' around here like, okay, there's a lot of possibilities here. I mean, look at that big old pile of metal. [chuckles] -[Sarah] Mm-hmm. -[Grifter] I'd love to collect that, melt that down, and put it into a giant sword. -[Sarah] Yeah. -[Grifter] You know, you get the fires really boilin', see that turn into liquid hot magma. -Oh yeah, Bob's gonna love you. This guy is great. He's wonderful. Hey Bob. -I can't believe you showed up here! -You offered me a job. -That was a lifetime ago. You just being here is jeopardizing my whole business. -But Bob. -But Bob, what? After what you did, there is no way I would hire little Innocent Isabella. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. You are Innocent Isabella Domenico, the legendary rat? -Yeah. -Your father is the Icebox Killer? -Mm-hmm. -Your mother is the Red Widow, Fat Ethyl? -Yeah, yeah. -Your uncle is Flat Top? -Mm-hmm. -Your brother is Jackie Tonsils? -Yeah. -And you're telling me that your cousin is Kissable John? -[Isabella] Yeah. -And you're telling me that your other cousin is Moving Company Mary? -Yeah. -Your aunt is Lazy Susan? -Yeah. - Your uncle, Jackie Red Lips. - Mm-hmm. -The creator of the most legendary red sauce. -Yes. -Your grandfather is Childish Steven. -Yeah. -So that means that your great-great-great-grandfather is Turkey Back Jimmy. -Yeah. -You're telling me right now that [sighs] your frickin' adopted brother is Tickle Me Thomas? - Yes. -[Grifter] Your cousin is Crinkle Cut Jack? -Yes. -[Grifter] And your brother-in-law is Good Guy Ravioli. -Yeah. -Are you telling me right now that your frickin' brother is Tiny Timmy Tincture, otherwise known as Tinc? -Uh-huh. -You, a member of the Domenico family, the legendary crime family? -Yeah. -So that means that your great-grandmother is Double DD Domenico. -[Isabella] Yeah. -That's Mama? -Yes. -You put your whole family in jail. Everybody I just mentioned is in prison 'cause of you. And that's why you're in witness protection, 'cause you named names. Okay, I, this is too much, I gotta go. -I just wanna be here, Bob. -Do you have any idea what Mama went through to keep you safe? You have a lot of nerve to come back here. [door slams] -Okay. [soft curious music] I can't believe you showed up here. [Isabella grumbling] -[Narrator] On July 15th, 1990, in Spencerport, New York- [switch clicks] [people moaning] [switch clicks] [soft music] -[Man] And what we feel happened was the, uh- [switch clicks] [people moaning] -[Man] The wall behind the- [horn honks] [faint upbeat music] [chair squeaking] -What you drinkin'? -It's a lager. -Yum, I love those. -[Lager Drinker] Uh-huh. -Now, there's like red lagers and dark lagers and amber lagers and pale lagers. Do you know what the difference between any of those are? -Uh, no. -Well, I do. It's about density. It's about purity. It's about alcohol content. It's about what's really gonna, I don't know, hit the taste buds in just the right way. That's what the difference between all those lagers are, not just coloration, but flavor, and I don't know. I just, every time I taste a new lager, I'm always thinking to myself, like, how does that compare to the other lagers I've had in the past? How does that compare to the lagers that have really knocked me on my butt in the taste buds? You know what I mean? That's kind of the thing I'm always looking for in a place like this. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love this place, but their lager selection seems a little bit lacking. You know what I mean? -Maybe you should find another place then. -No, I mean, I love this place, especially some of these vodkas over here. One thing that could really help this place out is, they just don't have the kind of vodka system that would really work in a place like this, where they could take some of these bottom-shelf vodkas. They can put them through a Brita filter about three or four times. They're going to taste exactly like top-shelf vodka. The only difference between a top-shelf vodka and a bottom-shelf vodka is filtration, purity, what's gonna give you a hangover the next day. That's kind of the thing that most people don't know about vodkas are, is, if you just work 'em, tweak 'em a little bit, you have something that actually is, uh, really even double, triple, quadruple your money. And, um, I don't know. I just kind of like stuff like that. Do you mind if I, uh... Could I try your lager? -Yeah, I mind. [chair squeaking] -All right. [faint lonesome country music] [patrons chattering] [latch clicks] [people moaning] [rooster crows] [timer ticking] [bell dings] [tense music] -Do I look like a Domenico to you? Do I look like a Domenico to you? 'Cause I'm a Domenico. Is that too much for you? [fair-goers shouting] [tense music swells] Hey, outta my way. [heels clicking] Domenico comin' through. Is this too much for you? -[Ticket Seller] Hello. -You got some tickets? -[Ticket Seller] Sure do. How many would you like? -How many you got? -[Ticket Seller] Oh, I got a lot. -[Isabella] Good, 'cause I need a lot of tickets. -[Ticket Seller] Okay, so it's a dollar a ticket. -[Isabella] Is there a problem here? -[Ticket Seller] What? No. Just tell me how many tickets you want. -[Isabella] Fine, if you're gonna make such a big stinkin' deal out of these tickets- - What? - You can keep 'em. -[Ticket Seller] Wait. -[Isabella] I don't need your stinkin' tickets. -[Ticket Seller] Ma'am. -[Ride Operator] All right, hold on tight. It's time to freak out. [ride whirring] [riders shouting] [phone ringing] - What? - Hey Mom. -[Mom] Son, what's wrong? Are you in trouble? - No, I'm not in trouble. -[Mom] What? Do you need money? [Mom speaking indistinctly] - No. No, no, I don't any money. -[Mom] What is it then? Where are you? Are you in jail? - I'm not in jail. - Are you-- - I'm fine. I'm in Alabama. -[Mom] In Alabama? What are- [Mom speaking indistinctly] -Yeah, Birmingham. [Mom speaking indistinctly] -Actually, I do know somebody. She's extremely well-connected. She's been showing me around. [Mom speaking indistinctly] - Yeah. -[Mom] Wait, wait, what's her [indistinct]? -Yeah, and I've been teachin' her some stuff too. -[Mom] Stuff? What stuff? -I told her your crutches bit, actually. -[Mom] Really? -Yeah, she took to it like a fish to water. -[Mom] Oh, this makes me so happy, [indistinct] so happy. - Yeah. I might, I might have screwed up yesterday though. -[Mom] What [indistinct]? -Yeah, I said some stuff, and I just took off. [Mom shouting indistinctly] Yeah. [Mom speaking indistinctly] What do you think I should do, Mom? [Mom speaking indistinctly] I should stop thinking about it, and it'll come to me.

[bright upbeat music] -[Announcer] Hope you're enjoying a fantastic first evening of the 2019 Canfield Fair. We had a beautiful afternoon today. Temperatures ended up in the mid-70s, and now it's cooling off quickly [indistinct]. Eventually, tonight will end up in the mid-50s, a cool, crisp start to Thursday. What a beautiful day we have coming up on Thursday, sunshine most of the day, temperatures a few degrees below average in the mid-70s, a dry day on Thursday. We do have a small risk for a passing shower in our forecast for Friday. -Isabella? [Isabella shouts] Hey. Hey, where you goin'? Isabella, come on. Come on, stop Isabella, stop! -[Isabella] Stay back! -[Grifter] I shouldn't have left you. -[Isabella] No. Stay away! -Okay, I'm sorry about yesterday. -[Isabella] I'm too much! -[Grifter] Come on, I came here to find you. Isabella, come on! -[Isabella] I'm dangerous. -[Grifter] Come on, I'm sorry. Come on. -[Isabella] I'm dangerous! -Don't leave the fair. You love the fair! -[Isabella] I'm too much! -[Grifter] Come on, I came to the fair to find you. -[Isabella] No! -Isabella! Come on, I shouldn't have- - No! - Called you a rat. -Yeah, because I'm not a rat. -Now, I shouldn't have called you a rat. Technically, you are a rat. -I'm not a rat. Mama asked me to go to the feds. -Double DD asked you to go to the feds? Why? -The family was breakin' all her rules and doin' really bad stuff. -Well, that's what you guys do. You're the Domenicos. You guys do bad stuff. -[Isabella] Even crime families got rules. -[Grifter] And what are these rules? -No killin' family, no killin' civilians. No killin' pets, no killin' family pets. No drugs, no robbing nursing homes, no drinkin' milk after 3:00 am. I mean, Mama had a lot of rules, and they were breakin' all of 'em. -Well, why doesn't anybody know about this? -[Isabella] Nobody can know, but it's the truth. -Well, if this is a lie, this is a very convincing lie. -[Isabella] I'm a terrible liar. -That is true. But I will tell you, this outfit, pretty good visual lie. -[Isabella] Thank you. -[Grifter] Come on, let's go back in the fair. You love the fear. You're not tryin' to leave now. -Don't you think I'm dangerous to be around? -And I'm not dangerous to be around? I'm Mr. In Bed By Nine O'clock? I don't think so. Come on, let's get somethin' to eat. There's gotta be something you like in there. -The cavatelli is excellent. -There we go, cavatelli. Come on. -[Isabella] You do need to try this cavatelli. -I don't know what that is, but- -[Isabella] It's pasta. -[Grifter] Like spaghetti? -[Isabella] No, it's like cavatelli. -Cavatelli and meatball, cavatelli bread bowl, cavatelli dinner. Okay, two cavatellis. I actually don't have any cash. -I have some cash. I got it. - Okay, all right. Yesterday, forget about that. That was so not me. The one thing I know not to do is ditch a Domenico. I love that you're a Domenico. I love that you're Innocent Isabella. -[Isabella] Yeah? -[Grifter] That's a treat for me. That's exciting. -[Isabella] Really? -[Grifter] Yes. -[Isabella] I'm a liability. -[Grifter] I don't care about liability. I'm a walking liability. What's the first word in liability? Lie. That's all I do. That's what I teach you how to do. You know, I just was a little overwhelmed to hear that you were a real life Domenico. -[Isabella] Hmm. Okay, I'm ready. -[Grifter] I'm so ready. - I'm hot. - I'm red hot. -[Carny] On your marks, get set, and go! [game whirring] [lighthearted music] And we're off to the races, folks. Look at 'em go, look at 'em go, look at 'em go! Number 11, number 11's the lucky winner. -[Isabella] I want a corn dog. I think we should get a corn dog. -[Grifter] I want a corn dog. Can we get a corn dog? Oh yeah. - You make these fresh yourself? -[Grifter] Cotton candy. - Hi. - Hi there. -[Isabella] Could I get a bag of cotton candy, please? -[Grifter] You know, I got a lot of respect for you coming here. I know there's a lot of heat on you. -[Isabella] Oh, I'd never miss the Canfield Fair, food, rides, prizes. -Hey, speaking of prizes, I was actually hoping there'd be a few more adult prizes, like a free car or something. It's just stuffed animals. -Mama took me here every year. -Well, Innocent Isabella and Double DD Domenico at the Canfield Fair, I love that. -You know, everyone called me innocent as an insult, but Mama called me innocent 'cause that's what she loved about me. -Cheers to Mama. -To Mama. [light dreamy music] I'm very tired. [yawns] -[Grifter] I haven't felt this bushed... You know how, like, when you, after you've eaten, you don't know what hungry feels like. -[Isabella] Mm-hmm. -It's like, when you're this bushed, how can you ever not be so bushed. -Yeah. -You know, these white trucks are designed to be slept in. This truck is extremely sleepable. It's extremely sleepable. I sleep in here. They make 'em so you can sleep in 'em. Seat, seat goes back. This is a great place to sleep. [rooster crows] Well, that was really fun. -[Isabella] Yeah, the fair's always fun. -You know, I spend most of my time alone. And, um, you were the first person I met in a long time where I feel like I don't need to lie to you. -What's your name? -My name? My name is Gary Briggs. -Gary Briggs. That's a nice name. -[Gary] Thank you. -What are you gonna do today, Gary Briggs? -You know, I think I'm ready to try that legendary corned beef from Kravitz Deli. What about you? -I think I'm ready too. -To try the corned beef? -No. I'm ready to go to 125 Churchill Hubbard Road. There's someone I gotta see. -[Gary] Okay. [lighthearted music] -[Isabella] Thanks for the ride. -[Gary] Yeah, of course. [door beeps] - Hi. - Hi. -[Receptionist] How can I help you? -[Isabella] I'm here to see Joe. -[Receptionist] Okay, I'll let him know. You can just take a seat. Hi, Joe, there's someone here to see ya. I don't think so. I think it's a walk-in. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Joe will be right out. [door creaks] -[Joe] Hi, I'm Joe. - Hi. - Nice to meet ya. Come on down. All right, come on in and grab a seat. All right, how can I help you out today? -Do you know who I am? -Not yet. -I'm Isabella Domenico, and I'm here to get the money Mama left me. -Mama? -Mama. -Mama. -Mama. -Okay, I'll get that money transferred over from the family's off-shore bank account right now. [gentle music] -Corned beef. You said it, Jack. [patrons chattering faintly] [baby crying] [machine rattling] [machine shrieking] [baby crying] [patrons chattering faintly] [baby crying] -[Isabella] Hi Gary. -[Gary] Well, if it isn't Innocent Isabella. -I'm thinkin' about leaving Youngstown. -That's amazing. I just had the exact same thought. -Hmm. What's the MSRP on this white truck? -Extremely good. -I thought so. You know, Mama always said, it's good to keep a liar around you can trust. -Well, full disclosure, I'm still on a test drive with this truck. It's not technically mine. -That's not a problem. [Isabella humming] -[Gary] So what did you mean when you said it's not a problem? -[Isabella] I mean it's not a problem. -[Gary] So you're saying it's taken care of? -[Isabella] I didn't say it's taken care of. I said it's not a problem. -[Gary] So you are telling me that it's not a problem. -[Isabella] I'm telling you it's not a problem. -[Gary] Well, then I guess it's not a problem. -[Salesman] Hi, ma'am. How can I help ya? -[Isabella] You see that white truck out there? -[Salesman] Yeah, the PRO-4X. That's a beautiful truck. -[Isabella] How much do you want for it? -[Salesman] Well, I'd have to check the MSRP. -[Isabella] I'm ready to buy it right now, cash. Let's leave out the paperwork. -[Salesman] Beautiful. ♪ I'll be livin' till the day I die ♪ ♪ I'll be on the horizon proppin' up the sky ♪ ♪ And I'll wait and I'll wait ♪ ♪ And I'll wait and I'll wait for that bit of mail ♪ ♪ One sweet little letter ♪ ♪ With a sting in its tail ♪ ♪ It's a confidence thing ♪ ♪ Yeah, it's a confidence thing ♪ ♪ It's a confidence thing ♪ ♪ Yeah, it's a confidence thing ♪
