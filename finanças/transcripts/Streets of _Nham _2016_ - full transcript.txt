I've always believed in law, you know? You've got good guys and you've got bad guys. Everything seemed so black and white. What's changed? I don't know, it seems a bit grey. Well sometimes Richard, people don't have a choice on what we become. I ought to go. You didn't come to see me? I'm sorry. Stay. I got to take care of something. Why don't you get yourself to bed now? Off you go. I'm all right, pet. I'm fine. It's fucked. Thank you. That won't make you cry. It's all right, yeah. Fucking hell. We're gonna get him back.

Is this it? This is it Kim, yeah. Fucking, I think it's not a good idea. What? Well, I don't know, she doesn't, she thinks I'm a bad mum or something, I don't want to be done for neglect or something. Kim, what have you done wrong? You've done nothing wrong. Just go in there and talk to her. All right. You come with me? Of course. Hi, Miss Smith, I'm really sorry to bother you. Kim? Yeah. What you doing here? I just wanted to ask you some questions. How did you get my address? I went down the school. Well, they shouldn't have given you my address. I'm really sorry. Look, I'm just going to be real with you. I haven't seen Mark in 24 hours, right. I know you saw him last and I wanted to ask you, talk to you about it, if that's possible. Kim, look, I told you all I know. I offered him a lift, but he didn't want one. He's your responsibility, Kim. If he doesn't show up that's your fault. Look, my son is missing, why you so fucking harsh with me? I don't know why you've got it in for me always. I'm just trying to explain to you to what's going on. Okay. Was he on his own on Shafter Road? Miss Smith, can we come talk about this in private, please? I'm actually in the middle of something. This is important. Come in. Just go through here. I'm sorry, I'm moving. Look I'm really sorry. I don't mean to bother you. Just, Mark really likes you and... He's a good boy. Yeah, he is. Look, I'm not a bad mum. He's been missing for 24 hours and I just thought you saw him on Shafter Road you said. I thought you might. I'm sorry Kim. If I knew anything, I'd tell you both. Miss Smith has he said... Kim. Hi, Denise? Yeah look, I'm not one for talking to Old Bill, but there's a kid involved. What did you see? The kid was talking to Paul, and some woman pulled up in a car. I think I recognise her from the school. A parent? No, no, like a teacher or something like that. What colour car? Silver, small, maybe a Fiesta or a Micro, maybe. And who's Paul? Oh no, he's harmless, he lives over there. He's a bit psycho. What number? 43 I think. Thank you. Yeah, whatever. I need you to check which female member of staff drives a silver car at Saint Thomas's School. Run me a check on an address. 43 Shafter Road. This is your fault. You're always clumsy, making mistakes. I'm sorry. I try to give you what you want, what you crave and look what you've done with it. You ruin it. Now who's going to clean up this mess? Me again? I didn't mean to take him. So I have to listen to you drone on about Calum for the rest of our lives, do I? He was my son. Was. He's dead you babbling imbecile. That poor mother was right, you are weak. Can't you see I was trying to help you? I didn't need your help. Sit. Sit down whilst I try and work out how to get us out of this fucking mess. Please. Please Paul, let them go. They haven't done anything. You can't hurt her. I won't let you. I want this to stop. Please, please, Paul. Please, you're not well. Please. Yes Jane? It's the teacher's house. Come on mate. Wake up mate. Fuck. Billy, give him to me. This piece of shit took my son. He killed my brother. I'll make him pay for both of us. Be smart here. Come here darling, come here. You all right darling? Mum? Mark. Mummy? Go look for Mark, go get Mark. Mark? Mark? Mark? Mark? Mum? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. You all right? Yeah. You okay? Okay, we're gonna go. All right, where's your stuff? You all right? Don't look at anything. Close your eyes. We're just going down the stairs. Yo, this is G to the I to the B to the B to the O, Gibbo's phone. Please leave a message after the tone, all right? I keep running through these events in my mind, but something just isn't adding up. Richard you sound like a broken record son. Listen, you might be a fool living round here, but you ain't fooling me. Off the record, Vinnie didn't kill his sister, did he? I know he didn't, it was Serji. But I'm running round here on a wild fucking goose chase, I can't touch him. All I know is that they operate out that warehouse. Yeah, it's not registered. I can't afford to have another dead body on my hands. There will be repercussions especially if it could have been prevented. So the question is, if he's taken Paul, where's he taken him? You guarantee it'd be some place special. Why do you say that? It was his brother he nutted off. I'm out of here. You know, I always wondered. Me I do it because of the money, to have a better life. You? Why? Why not? Why not? You killed my brother for why not? My blood. Wake up, wake up. This is for my brother. This for the why not. Where have you been? Go inside. I came as quick as I could. Have there been any developments? What's going on? You knew they were Albanians. What are you talking about? It was a guess, I told you. Don't bullshit me. I know as much as you do. Yeah? What's going on, I don't understand. Find a boy, find a killer. That's great detective work that. Shame you're a Judas fucking pig. I'm gonna prove it. Shit. Where's my cup, gorgeous. You want one? What's going on? Bought you a present. Yeah, what did you get me? What's this? You serious. It's our ticket out, mate. Oh my gosh. Mum? Oh my gosh. Mum? Go see what she wants then. Mum. Hello, man. How you doing? Gibbo. Bill. You all right. Not too bad. All right Gibbs, how's that arm going? It's fine. Thanks for that. No problem. I need your help.
