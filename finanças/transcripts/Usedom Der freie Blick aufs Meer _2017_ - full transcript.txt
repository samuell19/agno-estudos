The Isle of Usedom is an island in the Baltic Sea. The Eastern part belongs to Poland. The Western part belongs to Germany. Since 1945. Another hot and sunny day - up to 30 degrees Celsius, 24 degrees at the seaside - tomorrow will be sunny again. The other day someone asked me: How long have you been here? You've got a beautiful suntan. I said: Since November '52. He thought I was kidding. What else can I say? I was born here. I'll never leave this island. This is paradise. No reason to complain. The weather is wonderful.. Business is going well? You're from here? I grew up here. I don't want to leave. I'm sure it's a good idea to sell ice cream and drinks on the beach. With a summer like this and a good summer next year - we'll get by. Winter is a little bit hard, but we can make do. What about the future? I'm trained as a cook. Maybe I'll get a new job, but I'm forty-something and not very optimistic about that. With a little luck this beach business will boom - selling ice cream and drinks, some snacks.. Now I'm retired. I had a great time on the beach. 16 long years. Making some money and being happy all the time. People on this island have no reason to complain, if they do so, they did something wrong. Back in the '90's I was running around like a maniac. Look at me now. Relaxed. Cool. I don't buy my beer from the vendor. I bring two bottles from home.. I had to cut down my budget - but I got eight years without stress. Money can't buy that. I'm 66 and fit as a fiddle. That's important - not the dough. Life couldn't be better! I can't have more than four warm meals a day. If someone's sitting in front of us, we politely protest. We want to have a clear view of the sea. When I was a child I listened to the stories about my hometown Heringsdorf like they were fairy tales. In spring 1863, the brothers Hugo and Adelbert Delbruck, bankers from Berlin, were walking in a dense forest when through the trees they saw the Baltic Sea and proclaimed: "Here we shall stay!" They had found their own private paradise: a countryside untouched, a clear view of the vastness of the sea, all that was balm for their souls. However, they were bankers from Berlin, so they recognized the opportunities in a business model consisting of summer, sun, beach and sea. In those days there was only one church in Heringsdorf, there were 54 houses, 165 inhabitants, 5 horses and 9 cows. There was only one house between the shore and the village of Bansin. 50 years later the Imperial Spas announced 30,000 overnight stays. When I looked at these old picture postcards at the fashionable ladies and gentlemen I often wondered: where are all the people who worked for them so they could spend a carefree time at the seaside? I wanted to know who they were.. where did they come from, how did they live? Welcome to the Hotel Ahlbecker Hof. I'm Izabela Jarych. We have double rooms with a view of the sea and also junior suites with a view.. Just a moment. When do you wish to check in? We have a special offer.. 315 Euros.. You're welcome. After our studies we spent five years in the United States. Before that - after high school - before I met my husband I was in Germany. Munich and Cologne. My husband and I, we lived in Szczeczin, but as he was born in Swinemunde we always wanted to come back here. So he said one day: Why don't we pass around your resum and see what happens? So we came here for a weekend. took a ride across the island, and passed around my CV. The calls came in. Everything happened so fast. Just one month. We sold our flat in Szczeczin, moved here and I started to work. Most of the time I'm on the early shift because I have a little girl. My husband is a sailor. He's away most of the time so I don't have too much choice and I work the early shifts most of the time. But I try to be as flexible as possible.. The old school Grand Hotels belong to a dying species. It's a shame. I love them. I really do. I love the teatime in the afternoon like in the old days.. I like this old school service. If you are trained for a profession like that and if you come to like it then you just love all those things. Otherwise I could work in a french fry joint. I have worked in fourteen countries. I feel very close to the Arab world, the old countries. I have also worked in the Gulf States. They're not my cup of tea. They're Bedouins who came across oil one day. I love the old countries - Egypt, Iraq and so on. They fascinate me again and again. I'm a specialist for hotel openings and reconstructions. I have done that in Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Northern Africa Europe, the Caribbean, in the United States. Usedom.. I'm sure that's my place to be. I live in Heringsdorf and I love it. People are friendly, helpful, nice. I feel very much at home here. It's an advantage for this island to be half German and half Polish: The German Imperial Spas: an amazing spa architecture, but low population. On the other hand, Swinemunde has a population of 40,000. That's a very big advantage for us. These are the numbers of your bikes. You'll find them outside. Hello! Hello! It's your turn. Two buns with fried herring, one with smoked herring, one Bismarck.. You got out of bed? We went fishing.. - You? Fishing? I caught some canned fish. My favorite guests? From Saxony! They're always a gas. Fresh fish from the Baltic Sea soon at Harder's it will be. The fishermen lived here long before the hotels were built. The hotel owners who came here after the fall of the Berlin wall dislike the fishermen. They say our smoke chambers are a big nuisance to their guests. That's not the whole truth. Many tourists don't have the money to eat at their restaurants. They just have a fish bun for lunch here. Fried cod, fried plaice.. one big plate of salad, please.. The fish comes out of the water. It's as simple as that. Once a state secretary asked me: Where do you get your fish from? My answer was: out of the water. We are a long established family of fishermen. My grandmother's maiden name was Gamrath a very well known family of fishermen from Ahlbeck. My grandma helped to clean the fish on the beach. My great uncles were fishermen: Karl and Richard Gamrath. The love for the fish - we were born with it. I wanted him to be an electrician, but he said: I want to be a cook. I said: If you want to be a cook, we have to start our own wholesale business. We won't put the cart before the horse - we will be our own suppliers. That's where the money is. That's the way we did it. My grandma was a very, very kind woman - and she was an extraordinary cook. I was a little kid when we cooked together. She's the reason for my passions: produce and cooking. He got a very good apprenticeship - not at a high-quality hotel where they teach you to move the lettuce from one side of the plate to the other - but at the last German restaurant before Moscow - in Ahlbeck near the border. These wood chips are made from old whiskey barrels - we order them in Britain - no cheating. Whiskey was stored in them for more than a hundred years. It's an old Indian dish from Canada. That's the way we smoke our prawns. This aroma.. delicious. Prawns in their shells. It's amazing. We have Polish staff, we have German staff. We pay them well. That's it. Good wages, good staff. From the very beginning the Seaside Resorts were famous for their cosmopolitanism and tolerance. In 1922 an unexpected guest arrived. The official bulletin said that he came because of health reasons. These rooms are still in their original state. Here, Maxim Gorki worked on his novel "My Universities," volume three.. here at this desk on the right.. Maxi Gorki came here for two reasons: He had criticized Lenin for the red terror the famine, the executions, the gulags. That's why he had to leave Russia in October 1921. First he travelled to Norway. The owner of this house invited Maxim Gorki to stay here. He was a lawyer from Berlin: Dr. Friedrich Becher Gorki stayed here from May to September 1922 - he was hopeful to go back to Russia from here. That was impossible. After Lenin died in 1924, he could return to Russia. I cut this long story short because our musicians are waiting.. Thank you. Good evening, dear friends. We bring you warmest regards from Russia, from Moscow. I grew up in Slubice - I also went to school there. It's a border town about 100 kilometers east of Berlin. I grew up on the border. I've known the German-Polish border since my early days. Those days were quite different. As life goes, there are moments in life when you have no influence on the way things happen. With me it was a few days before my 18th birthday when my parents died in a car accident. After my parents' death I reflected on my life very deeply. This experience did something to me. Our lifetime may pass so quickly and we may have no chance to influence it.. tomorrow may be your last day on earth. The whole thing started in 2009: with me, the three Imperial Spas and the city of Swinemunde. Ahlbeck, Heringsdorf, Bansin have a unique selling feature: this seaside architecture. That's great for the tourists. Swinoujscie - then Swinemunde - was bombed in March '45. We must not forget. It was called the "Dresden of the North" More than 20,000 died in one day. We must not forget: Who was living in Swinoujscie after the war? Displaced people from the East of Poland - that's very important to remember. We are an island of displaced persons. Our history was redefined after 1945 - that's why it is important that we start projects together to improve life on our island. And again, we must not forget: Swinoujscie, Swinemunde was the capital of the island. Swinemunde was the port where the Imperial Fleet with Wilhelm II aboard his flagship Hohenzollern arrived first. We must always remember our common history before 1945 as well as after - especially after 1992.. when the last Soviet soldier left Swinoujscie by ship. Only after 1992 could Polish Swinoujscie develop in a free way. The river Swina divides the city of Swinemunde into two parts. The Eastern part set on the Isle of Wollin and the Western part set on the Isle of Usedom. The river is an arm of the Baltic Sea - connecting it with the Stettin Lagoon. At the end of the war Swinemunde had a German population of 10,000. After the town became Polish in October 1945, Poles and Ukrainians were transferred to Swinemunde from those parts of Eastern Poland which had become part of the Soviet Union. Ernest Bruno's grandparents came to Swinemunde this way in the early 1950s. My mother, Silwia, and my cousin Krzysztof. My younger cousin Simon - he's also my godchild. My grandma, my mother's mom - my uncle - sorry - my grandpa, my mom's father. I came here with my parents when I was four years old that was shortly after the war. Half of the town was destroyed. It wasn't a nice time. I loved to dance, all kinds of dances. Jive, Rock'n'Roll.. He was a guitar player in a dancing cafe He was playing all the time - and looking at me. He was playing, I was dancing.. we looked at each other again and again. It was love at first sight. He went to a store where they sell old equipment.. Junkyard!! junkyard.. that is, very old equipment.. He paid 5 Zloty for it. It's the engine from a baking oven. When winter comes, he puts on his specs and tries to find out what he can make of it. My mom moved to Germany when I was six or seven years old. Two, maybe three years later, she took me to Germany. Now I've been living in Bedburg near Cologne for about ten years. My mom even longer.. I really wanted to go back to Poland to see the situation here with my own eyes: how difficult it is to live here. My mom left Poland because it was hard to find a job and because of the situation in general. I always wanted to go back to Poland - when I was a little older. What's the biggest difference for you between Poland and Germany? The biggest difference? The people? In Germany there is more tolerance towards foreigners. Where do you feel more at home? When I'm here I feel very much at home. When I'm back in Germany I feel at home there. Maybe I'll stay another twenty years in Germany. But I want to go home when I'm old. My grandma wouldn't allow me to live off her money. Are they proud of you? Very proud, they tell me. Very proud. Your hot chocolate.. A few days ago I read a review by one of our guests on HolidayCheck or TripAdvisor - his grandpa had been here a long time ago - his father had been here.. now he had been here himself. It was such a touching story - I had to send him a message. He doesn't live in Germany. He was born near Danzig. After the war his family was among the displaced Germans. As his wife isn't German, he wanted to show her Usedom - the places where his grandpa and his dad had spent their vacations. His grandpa had been a surgeon at the Charité in Berlin. With a hotel like the Ahlbecker Hof built in 1890 you come across such stories again and again. We meet interesting people. I do believe people want to know where their parents, their grandparents spent their holidays. So they come here to see all the places. They want to know: How did they live here? What did they see? That man wrote that his wife had always believed that Germany was a country without a seaside. He wanted to show her: We do have a seashore. In 1872, the Delbruck Brothers founded the Corporation Seebad Heringsdorf, Inc. Their business boomed also thanks to Kaiser Wilhelm. From on 1882 he visited the seaside resorts of Bansin, Heringsdorf, Ahlbeck and Swinemunde - every first weekend in August. Soon these resorts were called the Imperial Spas. We will create a new infrastructure along the coastline. New hotels, many new hotels.. the demand is tremendous. The town is popular with tourists - there are more of them every year - both on the German side and on the Polish side. The geographic position of Swinemunde has many advantages. The western part of Swinemunde, on the Isle of Usedom, is characterized by tourism. In the middle we have the River Swina. The part of the town on the other side of the river will experience more industrial development. There we have the new gas terminal - and the port is being extended. Swinoujscie has two pillars: tourism on the Isle of Usedom, industry on the Isle of Wollin. We try to combine the two. I think it's a wise decision. If tourism doesn't work, the industrial zone will. It's a good idea to try to walk on two legs. The Radisson Blu is one of the biggest investments in the Baltic area. It's a very big project: 353 double-bed rooms. Five-star hotels are important for the infrastructure of the island. Each and every morning, a little earlier most days. Isn't it a fantastic piece of earth? It's the most beautiful beach area of the island to me with its cliffs and its peace. Here I can relax, here I calm down. There are so many problems spinning around my head. Four years as a mayor - it's madness. All the things I had to think about.. it's impossible for someone from outside to imagine. When I go for a walk in the morning sometimes I see a beautiful picture and because I want other people to see it I post it. I get a lot of likes. People enjoy these photos. Yesterday I posted a beautiful cloud - for me it looked like a dog.. for others like two praying hands. Swinemunde used to be the center of the island. More or less. Why shouldn't it be again? Because it's on the Polish side? People go shopping there, people visit the restaurants. There are flats available for people who work on the island. Only together can we succeed. However, there are some sensitive issues. They're starting projects without consulting us. Look at that terminal. We're talking about security. I don't know about the risks. I do hope this terminal is safe. What about terrorist acts? What would happen, if. .? Think of giant gas tankers. We have very different opinions - you have to think of the worst case, but there were no meetings, no opinion-forming process. To put it very clearly: I don't begrudge them all that. I'd like to have their tax revenues myself for better development opportunities. Stagnation is not an option - that's why you need the money. In 1672 for the first time it was mentioned that peasants were living on the Isle of Gormitz. The nam Gormitz originated from the Slavic expression for summer seed. Sea eagle.. We have long-tailed tits.. not at the moment because they are on their way down south. Robins, of course, nightingales.. I'm trying to learn about the beautiful birds we have here. This is a private hunting ground. That's why I bought it. It's like a childhood dream: an island for boys, a playground for good friends - and for me.. We're engaged in substantial bird protection. We killed thirty wild sows. We cut the reeds down. Last winter we had no wild sows here. Huntable wild animals.. we have the sea eagle - but it's protected throughout the year. We have three does with their fawns. We don't mow anymore, but do some mulching.. very carefully, because the animals were often cut by mowers. We had to demolish about ten houses - only five are left. I'd like to run a small and nice organic farm here, some sustainable tourism. Maybe we'll have plum cake parties on Fridays. I was born in Rostock in 1965. I grew up there on a small farm just outside of town. I went to school in Rostock. As a kid I had a couple of horses and some sheep. I grew up in East Germany. I studied agriculture. I was a sheep shearer until the fall of the wall in 1989. I lived in Hamburg for one year. I worked for a messenger service, but somehow it felt wrong. So I went back home and started to breed galloways. We started to restore a natural reserve to its original state - in collaboration with the town of Rostock. We restored intensively-used pastures with the help of galloways. Now we have a farm around Rostock.. about 1,000 hectares of land, 1,200 head of livestock - mother cows, heifers, breeding, bulls - the full monty. It's all organic meat and I believe we have a good chance to do the same here. It's amazing how you can work with them. When we brought them here they were absolutely shy. They'll all be mother cows. We want to do the breeding on this island. We're sure to produce top beef here for esoteric reasons: plenty of sunlight, fresh herbs, fresh air. All the animals are healthy. Let's go. This area is classified as forest. That will change sooner or later. You see the question: Interested? Of course people are interested in buying such property.. or buying a condominium. Here we have another empty site.. a subject of dispute for years about what's to be built here. I heard through the grapevine the problem will be solved soon.. so this ugly site will disappear. Here we have an object of speculation - the Old Trade School with the Hotel Frithjof. That building has been empty for 25 years. It's a top location - close to the seaside promenade. 12,000 square meters. It's my job to be very pushy. I have to acquire these old properties to have something to sell. We're talking about the luxury segment. It's my job to find a new investor. The investor, the architect and myself - we have to find out: What is it that the market wants? That's the product I sell: Lifestyle. Usedom is sexy, Usedom is cool. Nice to meet you. I'm Mathias Hasbargen. Kuhlmann.. Mrs. Kuhlmann, what can I do for you? I'm looking for an apartment.. It's my great pleasure to show you the house. Here we have an apartment with two bathrooms, two bedrooms and a balcony. All apartments have the same equipment. At this time of the year the sun will shine on your balcony. at about 3 p. m., maybe 3.30 - trust me.. Very nice.. so you can sit here with a glass of wine and a good cigar and let the world pass you by. Over there you see the port and the lighthouse of Swinemunde. When winter comes - believe me - you even can see the Heringsdorf Pier - and a little bit of the Ahlbeck Pier, but it's right at the beach front. It's high noon - and it's midsummer. At this time you're sitting in the shade here. I used to say: red wine at the back hot wine punch at the front. Mathias Hasbargen seemed to me like a soul mate of my grandfather - who had been an architect in the spas - throughout his life he had a dream: that his seaside resorts might become as fashionable as Monaco. He dreamed of Heringsdorf as the Nice of the North. One of his dreams came true: he built his Villa Carmen right at the Bansin Promenade. "Carmen" had been his wife's favorite opera. My grandma. Here he welcomed Lilian Harvey and Willy Fritsch when they still were the most glamorous couple of the German movies. Before World War I the Usedom Spas had become Berlin's bathtub There were vaudeville shows. "Original Shrammeln," from Vienna, Wild West bands and singers from Tyrol. In 1910 the famous critic Alfred Kerr wrote: "In Heringsdorf you meet those people you wanted to leave behind in Berlin." Architects from Berlin built these stately homes for wealthy bankers, industrialists, artists and scholars. Many Jewish families found a home here before they were banned from swimming in the Baltic Sea - July 27th, 1935. That's the villa of Benoit Oppenheim, a Jewish banker who was born in Koenigsberg now Kaliningrad. That was his home. He and his brother-in-law, a certain Mr. Warschauer, founded a bank in Berlin and acquired a moderate fortune. He made good use of his fortune. He knew the right people and he became a rich banker in Berlin, so he could spend his money on this home - it was one of the first houses here. He wanted to express his feelings: "Look here, I've made it!" Here he spent the summer with his American friends. They played chess or cards and they did business here. Gerson Bleichroder, Bismarck's banker, lived next door. Adelbert Delbruck, co-founder of the Deutsche Bank, lived over there. They were in a calling distance to exchange financial news they got from Berlin by carrier pigeons. This house is in its original state. It's a marvelous example of a Grunderzeit Villa built by someone who had made it: Benoit Oppenheim. After the villa was confiscated by the Nazis the owners changed again and again. The Villa became the local office of the Nazi Party, it was a sanatorium for high-ranking officers of the Red Army and guesthouse of the Ministry for State Security of the GDR. The experts of the socialist planned economy ignored the business model of the Berlin bankers for forty years. The anachronistic side effect was that they preserved examples of bourgeois culture - a culture they wanted to overcome. The change came with the fall of the Berlin wall. 100 years after the Brothers Delbruck had invented their business model it came to life once again. A new generation of investors came on the island - respectable entrepreneurs, soldiers of fortune, speculators. Many of them went bankrupt - despite of all their honorable intentions. My wife and I - we wanted to seize the opportunities of the German reunification. We bought two hotels here - we want to establish a commercial center, with hotels, restaurants, shops. We want to liven things up here, in this beautiful seaside resort that always attracted us. The two hotels we bought were in a terrible state - like Potemkin villages. But we're making progress. We opened a restaurant on the ground floor and a bistro. We were taken by surprise how much the people of Heringsdorf enjoyed it and how they accept us. Of course there are some conflicts - we are "Wessie" - we took away the houses. It's not always easy, but we coexist - with some goodwill on both sides. Here we have a dear friend we all know. We found him in a dark and stuffy storeroom. We'll take good care of him and maybe find a place of honor for him. The spirit will change. James Dean's already waiting over there. Just like Marilyn Monroe. This room used to be a dining hall - it was also a place of entertainment - of course according to the ruling political practice. As I said: we'll have a new spirit here - Karl Marx will be taken away, Marilyn Monroe will enter the hall. Life will be more fun here - at least a little bit. When we shot this sequence in 1991 - dancers in front of the old ballroom of the hotel Meeresstrand in Bansin - which only had a few days left - I hoped with all my heart that my island wouldn't have the same fate of so many holiday paradises which paid the price for their beauty with concrete. The Hotel Meeresstrand became the Hotel Kaiserstrand. I came to this island in 1989. I had been invited to a personal interview with an "Institute for Professional Development and Retraining" - it doesn't exist anymore. I've been a lecturer there for about three years. In my earlier life I had sold locomotives to India - I worked for an international logistic company in Denmark - for ten years I built Danish furniture for the German market - my professional life was of the diversified kind. Why did I move to Bansin? It's quite simple. My marriage ended April 1st, 1990 - in Flensburg. I wanted to move as far away from my divorced wife as I could - and ended up on this island. The first thing I did was to get on my bike - I took a video camera I had got for the job application training I was supposed to do. I recorded all the beautiful old mansions I knew nothing would stay the way it was. We're now in Bansin right at the beginning of Berg Street. It is the largest ensemble of seaside architecture we have on the Isle of Usedom. The whole ensemble was built from 1895 to 1913. Two beautiful houses formed the entrance to this quarter. They were called Emma and Aegir. Both houses had become very dear to me. When they were demolished - I shed some of my heart's blood. Both houses survived World War I and II - and forty years of East German life then they were sold to a lawyer from Hamburg. 15 years later he sold them - with some profit - to a ship owner from Sylt who wasn't interested in reconstructing these houses. In a dubious way the preservation order for both houses was cancelled. For the first time in history and maybe the last the people of Bansin organized a protest rally. The houses were demolished - against the will of the people - against the will of the local administration. I have nothing against modern architecture but two historic buildings had to die. Here in this place was a beautiful old hotel. . it was called the Reichskanzler. In front of the Reichskanzler you would see the Aegir - it had a flat roof - so from the Reichskanzler you would have a clear view at the Baltic sea. In those days people tried to work together and not one against the other, like nowadays. The years following 1990 were called the second grunderzeit - empty sites between buildings were filled in, historic structures disappeared. Quantity was more important than quality. The local councils didn't draw up long-term building plans. They still suffer from this mistake. I always wanted to protect our seaside architecture. That's why I became a local councillor and head of the construction committee. I had to watch massive uncontrolled construction activities. Traditional sites were messed up by buildings without any aesthetic value. Once we had a beautiful Maxim-Gorki-Street - there wasn't another street like that in all of Europe. This street was lined with large properties and historic houses. I remember an old guidebook from the 1930's: "Stroll along Maxim-Gorki-Street and you shall see a unique seaside architecture." After the fall of the Berlin Wall local politicians made mistakes. They had no political experience. We had no development planning to regulate the construction of new buildings. Every time I walk down Maxi-Gorki-Street it's a pain in my heart. Most of the new buildings have nothing to do with architecture. The development plan is an instrument you need in order to keep control. Mistakes were made in the 1990's - not just due to inexperience. The mayors of Ahlbeck, Bansin and Heringsdorf were imported from West Germany. They were experienced local government officers. The sad truth is communities are not in control of the procedures. We can only give a communal agreement. It's true we've made mistakes. We went to court very often - and lost every single case. I wonder: I'm a local councillor, I'm the head of the local construction committee - am I a toothless tiger? If we should decide this project doesn't match with our seaside architecture by the promenade - and it is a majority decision - then what? Five or six weeks later this project has been approved by the district authorities. I remember a project when I invited the woman in charge of historical preservation to a local council meeting. I asked her: How does it make you feel when you give permission to build such a thing directly by the promenade? The answer was quite simple: Every era creates a new style. All I could say was: I feel deeply ashamed - for such architecture. That's why I resigned my office as head of the construction committee, because there was no use in fighting anymore. Whenever we tried to prevent some damage the district authorities would come along and say: We authorize this project. Dear guests, dear visitors - this is your baywatch. Isabell Miller - six years old - is looking for her parents. She's now here at lifeguard tower number one. Isabell Miller, a six year old girl is looking for their parents. She's waiting at lifeguard tower number one. Thank you very much. I'd like to have a little more space - open-minded people. open-minded people, but we have no choice. A little more space would be fine - there's so much beach.. 100 meters more to the left, 100 meters more to the right - life would be easier - for instance, people without dogs.. people without dogs come here - they occupy our beach - they get angry if a dog comes close to them. It's a dog beach, so dogs can run free. People who hate dogs - why don't they go there - or there - they want to be here. We want our old Emperor Wilhelm back We want our old Emperor Wilhelm back The one with the beard The one with the beard With the long, long beard. Everybody! When August comes to life - followers of the Emperor get ecstatic because, year after year the imperial couple comes to Usedom - strolling along the promenade.. This year I made four sailing tours. I've been sailing to Bornholm, Ystad, Malm, Copenhagen.. triangular courses, smaller regatta courses.. or sailing around Bornholm - that's really fun. Or Kristiansoe, a prison island just above Bornholm. That's a nice place to head for. I love the Baltic Sea for the steady winds.. out on the open sea you find good winds almost everyday. This sea is never bad-tempered, always good-natured. That's the difference between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Sometimes there are heavy waves - but never really dangerous. I'm just moving.. the wind is turning.. just a moment. Very good.. The fisherman from Freest.. It's always been a nice place. When I was a kid we'd go camping here. When I was a young man I came here with my motorbike and my tent. Sailing's always been my first passion and right from the start I wanted to sail around the world - so I bought this boat. Everything I learned about sailing in heavy seas - was here off Peenemunde. Peenemunde was unspoiled. It was the most beautiful port of the island. When the army had left, it still felt like the old East. The animals had conquered the whole area - each night the foxes took a look at my boat. It was a way of life you didn't find at any other port. We had barbecues - we'd light driftwood fires. It's close to the Baltic Sea. It's a perfect place to start a sailing trip around the word. Wherever I went, Canary Islands, Portugal, nobody had ever heard about the Isle of Usedom. The Baltic Sea.. that was a little bit better - even better was to say "Peenemunde" Peenemunde? Baltic Sea? Wernher von Braun! That was on the radar. Nobody knew that Peenemunde is a place on the Isle of Usedom, but they knew the word "Peenemunde" - the history of rocket engineering. Experiences like that give you the courage to just let go.. It's exciting to be on your own for weeks. Are you on good terms with yourself? The romantic days of Peenemunde-Northern Port are history. No more foxes anymore. No more driftwood fires. 25 years ago I met an investor who dreamed of prospering landscapes in the inland that was called "outback" in those days. Here we have about 100 hectares of land. We're at the right place at the right time. Over there you see the old pig farm - a former cooperative. There we'll build an artificial lake with an artificial island, restaurants and a congress center. Here we'll provide accommodation for the congress participants. One-story buildings, hexagonal, wood, glass, organic thatched roofs, no concrete, in complete harmony with this environment 13 restaurants all over the place - we'll have to feed 1,500 people. Sports fields, to play tennis or to go jogging.. This is our congress center for 1,500 participants. A ferry connects the villages of East and West Klune - a place between the Stettin Lagon and the Lake Usedom. The ferry is called "Karla" - the name of the ferryman's mother. We're boaters. We like to come here. This place is rustic and cozy. That's important isn't it, Norbert? And it'll stay like that. The tipsy boater goes aboard and takes a nap. True? And when he's fine again he gets another beer. I didn't talk about beer. I'm retired. It's OK. Norbert, aren't you too.. Only recently.. I've been working in the stables for 30 years. Cattle. It's over. It doesn't make sense anymore. Most people here are retired. Some villagers are still working - at the seaside. There's one farmer left, but his main job is with a sanitary installation company - he's more a hobby farmer. There are some small traders. Some of the younger men are construction workers or caretakers. Most of the people here are retired. Even the newcomers are older people. There's no job market here in the inland. My daughter worked for a hotel - my son-in-law is an old people's nurse. They moved to Hamburg - there were no career prospects here. They have found themselves a nice flat and they got good jobs. My daughter has been retrained as a preschool teacher - with two little kids in school she couldn't work in a hotel anymore. It's a regular job. They are happy. I don't think that one of my kids will come back. Would be great, however.. Gabi, Gabi, we brought him back.. That's game goulash with potatoes, paprika, red beans.. about 25, 30 liters. I hope I can feed all the hungry.. Belly bacon, cattle bone to round off the taste.. cucumbers, red beans. Dinner can be served. The small place of Kamminke - right on the border with Poland - is one of the oldest fishing villages on the island. Nowadays most of the ships in the harbor are pleasure or motor boats. I take this ferry once or twice a week - on my way to buy fresh fish. We have contacts in Stettin, in Kolberg, in Danzig - with all kinds of smokehouses. I love to be in Poland. Poland is a very beautiful country - not only because of the women. The countryside is beautiful too Things really get rocking here. The Amber Baltic - most of the cars are German. Most investments are Polish - they don't need us anymore. I have to test that upstairs - if we can hear the music. tune in "sexy" on the web radio - and all the rooms get the music. Is it allowed what I'm doing here? Probably not. Maybe even illegal. The work the girls do is legal. My job isn't - to provide certain things. I've been here for more than 20 years, the authorities know me - I'm under their control. I don't want to cause no trouble, I try to take care of things in a way that makes everybody happy. I've been in this business for such a long time. They know that I'm not playing tricks on them. There are neither drugs nor forced prostitution here.. though some people may think so. We have an excessive bureaucracy. The girls must get visas. They get contracts. I make my payments to the social insurance - that's a good thing, in case.. we shouldn't discuss the legal situation here. My impression was that in Poland most of the girls were being exploited. I came to Swinemunde.. I ran out of money and I was kind of a castaway. I had a girlfriend who worked in front of a nightclub - we talked a lot about this business. Italians, Greeks, Turks, clubowners, pretty rarely a Polish captain or businessman.. it's a melting pot. Germans less and less - perhaps 50 per cent. We have many Polish guests.. from here or from England - who come back and try their luck here - and spend their money. It's not very expensive here - on the contrary. Then there is the port. We're very international - as I knew it in Hamburg. It's very low water.. On your mark, ready? Start running! It's your island. Last week we had very high water. 60 per cent of the island was under water and we could see only the high spots. It was one meter above normal - it was time to take our animals home - a few days earlier as we had planned. We brought them here end of April so we have to take them home at the end of October. Ten transports to get all the cattle on the mainland. They're in good shape. We're absolutely happy. They weighed 280 kilos when we brought them here.. now they weigh about 400 - in really good shape. you get them on the truck and the rest can wait. You think it will work? Why shouldn't it? Just let them jump. There's one group that comes into the corral from.. We'll move the fence - so it gets narrow.. and we get them in smooth and easy. Right-o.. Now.. go.. hop.. Freedom on this island. I'm not a townie. I grew up on a cattle farm in South Africa. The town was just too narrow for me. Germany is a little bit narrow But this is a beautiful place to work.. Freedom.. I really feel at home here.. working conditions are very good. It's really important to have someone who likes this place. I had some employees who said it's like a prison island - that's why they wanted to spend their nights on the mainland. We're completely different. I'd be here all the time if I only could. The day will come. Not right now, but some day.. Some day.. Last year we had fourteen nationalities. This year we have twelve. Poland, Thailand, Croatia, Yugoslavia.. wherever people come from to work here, to live here. Our community has 9,000 inhabitants. We've got a baby boomer generation and we have a very large region - with Korswandt, Kamminke, Reetzow. We wanted to give our kids a good school - the trip to school shouldn't be too far. That's why we'd never reject a child if parents prefer to send their child to this school. They're probably working in a restaurant or in a hotel. Do you like your school? Yes! Are you missing anything? It starts too early. It starts too early? I can't change that.. a playing field.. We'll build that next year. I hope for my daughter that she learns a lot about the world. My husband and I - we'll do everything to make that come true. It's more important than school.. However, I do hope she'll attend a good school.. and finish it. She's learning English at school - next year German, too. She has a private teacher to learn German. My husband and I - we can't stay long in one place. We always must try something new - we always need a new adventure. When you get to know something and really learn a lot about it - and have the feeling your progress stops - then we move on to the next thing. Swinemunde is not our private retreat. We don't want to stay here forever. You've got to love your work - money will come in somehow. Of course it's great to have both at the same time. This is the part of our Europa Promenade right on the border. We stand with one leg in Poland, with the other in Germany. With both legs in both countries. This could describe my work. There was a time in my life when I thought a lot about the relationship between the Germans and the Poles. You see, I come from a German-Polish family - comes a time to build bridges between Germans and Poles. That's why I do what I do. The Seaside Promenade from Swinioujscie to Bansin is 12 kilometers long. It's the longest in Europe. After World War II the checkpoint near Ahlbeck was closed down. It remained closed until 1972. Then the crossing was opened - for eight years. When the workers of the Gdansk shipyards went on strike it was blocked hermetically. The big change came after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For a short moment, autumn is a time of peace and reflection. It's also a time of heavy storms - in some years, they meet the shore with tremendous force. One century ago heavy storms destroyed the piers of Heringsdorf and Ahlbeck. This autumn, once more the sea washes away parts of the beach. Bansin. Seaside Promenade. End of November. Mr. and Mrs. Krause open their snack stand for the last time this year. They couldn't tell me if I'd meet them again next spring. It's our last day. Last night we went home at 6 p. m. Work till you drop.. - No, not me. I'd go on strike. My husband is 79 years old and I'm 75. What's up? Closing time? Have a nice evening.. In the course of the years the business model of the founding fathers changed. It's not only about summer, sun, beach and sea anymore. It's the turn of the year. Tourists flood the island. It's the same every season. For those who won't come Mayor Petersen is posting his photos.. I hope this oyster is for me, because it looks the best.. Say it: it's the most beautiful.. - By far.. Very kind, thanks. Villa Westend is making progress - people will move in at the end of February. We started the second phase.. business is good.. the apartments are wonderful. We sold all the top-price penthouses.. penthouse enthusiasts do exist. I'm busy all the time always in a hurry.. I've got to go right now. I'll meet potential buyers. I'm always ready.. Alex, cheers, it was a successful 2016. We'll meet again here next year with oysters and champagne. We hold a reception at 6 p. m. to welcome our guests. Then we'll move to the restaurant - we like our guests to have dinner together. It's not easy to organize an evening with a 6-course menu. Between the courses there will be short breaks - little breathers - or smoking breaks - time for a drink or a little fresh air or a dance at the open fireplace. The fireworks starts at midnight - and after the fireworks some our guests come back some go to the party tent that's more disco. Most of them like to come back here - a New Year's Eve Party at the Ahlbecker Hof goes till early morning. You got the menu? Let's have a look at the details.. Full house. I could do with another 100 rooms. You really got me. Our restaurants are crammed. Heringsdorf, Bansin, Ahlbeck. The hotel we opened last night. Crammed. Holiday? No idea. If there is time.. not in January - Green Week Berlin. Maybe in February or March. Then it's full speed again. Maybe in winter, beginning of December. We're on holiday when we don't have any guests. There are three islands in Germany: Sylt is the most expensive. Rugen is the biggest. Usedom is the most beautiful. Every New Year's Eve when I see thousands of tourists looking up into the sky and into the fireworks I want to believe that they think about the chances this island has just as the islanders should do - and sometimes they should consider the risks. In 1913 the Imperial Seaside Resorts registered 30,000 overnight stays. In our time there are more than four million a year.
