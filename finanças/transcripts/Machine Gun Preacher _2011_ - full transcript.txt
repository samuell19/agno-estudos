He sees our shadow and He says "Let there be light." The point of receiving God's word is life. Life upon life, and to accept the blood of Jesus, that is life upon life upon life. Praise be to God. (CONGREGATION APPLAUDS) Praise be to God. In Mark it talks about John the Baptist, how he went about baptizing the water. But John says there's coming one after me who's mightier than I. I'm unworthy to even unlace the thong of his sandal. I baptize the water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. So let us now proclaim His saving Grace. If there are sinners here today, looking for God, I want you to raise your hands. Come on, raise them up high to heaven. Raise your hands and stand up. Come on, now. Stand up. Receive Jesus Christ as your light and your savior. Stand up! Brother, I see it. I see that look of doubt in your eye. I know you're thinking, I m just too dirty a sinner. He can't forgive me." Yes, He can. Yes, He can. You just knock and be received. Come on now, stand up. Come on home to Jesus. Yes, sir. Stand up. All right. All right. Hallelujah.

(GIRL CONTINUES SINGING) MAN: Upon your confession of faith and your obedience to the word of God regarding His death, burial and resurrection, I do indeed baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins.

(CONGREGATION APPLAUDS) Thank you, Pastor Krause, and thank you, brothers and sisters, for inviting me into this house of the Lord. I'm here today to talk to you about your Christian brothers and sisters, families just like yours half a world away that desperately need your help. Though they might appear to be strangers, living a life very different from our own, in God's eyes, every man is a brother. And every soul is deserving of your Christian charity. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS) Don't move. Be cool. What the fuck, man? What are you doing here? I'm here for that boy right there. You gonna get in the way of that? (DONNIE MOANING) Sammy, I can't do it. I can't. I can't. God don't make trash, boy. He ain't giving up on you, so don't you give up on Him, you hear me? What was wrong with her anyway? Well, I don't know. They called it thrombosis. And she couldn't walk, she couldn't drive anymore. But I think that prayer circle made all the difference in the world. - LYNN: Now she can get her hair done. - That's right. Babe, why don't you go grab some more beans, will you? You know, I was thinking about that fella Sunday. - What fella? - That... Pastor Relling. - WOMAN: Mm. - The missionary fella. WOMAN: That's a nice-looking man. Oh, yeah, he talked funny. Yeah, he's just from a difference place than us, baby, that's all. SAM: I like what they're doing down there. - It's a good cause. - Sure is. I was thinking maybe I could go over there. You know? See what they got going on. - Africa? - Yeah. You mean like to help them? SAM: Yeah, why not? Reckon they can do with all the help they can get. Especially in construction. WOMAN: Oh, yeah. Well, that's a good idea. Thought I'd go and do that. LYNN: What about the business? What about that job you got going over in Boswell? Job's gonna be finished in five days. I'll only be gone for a few weeks, though. I'll be back before you know it. WOMAN: That's not so long, we'll be fine. - Mm-hm. - It's not so long. - Yeah? Yeah? - It's a nice idea, Sam. (PEOPLE SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) What are you? Ugandan army or something? SPLA. Sudanese People's Liberation Army. Yeah, I don't know that. What's that? We are freedom fighters. Well, hello, freedom fighters. I'm Sam. My name is Deng. Deng? Nice to meet you, Deng. Sam. - Marco. - Hey, Marco. So, you boys busy or... ...maybe you can give me a hand with the rubble. No. I didn't think so. All right. Good. Well, I'll let you guys get back to what you were doing. But I'll be seeing you around. (GRUNTS) Childers. Some of us are going into Kampala tomorrow night. Try to find a little fun this weekend. You wanna come along? Actually, I was thinking of going up north. You crazy? There's a civil war going on up there. I know. Suit yourself. - Hey, Deng, want a Coke? - Yes. - Here you go. - Thank you. You got a cool breeze blowing through the shade here. - It's very hot today. - Yeah. I got a question for you. I want to go into Sudan this weekend. Need someone to show me around. You interested? - The others are going to Kampala. - I know. That ain't my speed no more. I wanna see some country. You want to see? SAM: This thing go any faster? DENG: I wish it could. Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find us on the open road, it would be very bad. So where you from? From a little village called Aweil. Many hours from here. And you? - Are you from New York City? - No. I ain't no city boy. I'm a hillbilly from Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania. That's it. Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania. Is Aweil where your family is? Not anymore. My family was killed by the LRA. The Muslim north has been killing the Christians in the south for over 30 years. Two million of my people lost their lives. These people have been driven from their villages. But as you can see, these camps are not much better. Cholera and malaria are everywhere. Even here they are afraid the LRA will attack at night. (BOTH SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Sony, I will be right back. Of course. Do what you gotta do. Excuse me, you. Black shin. Come over here. Please help me. I need to transfer this woman to the bed. Grab her by her shoulders. One, two... What do we have here? Trauma to the lips. Can I have some gauze please, for direct pressure. (WOMAN WHIMPERING) What happened? Trauma to her lips. What happened to her face? She argued with the rebels so they cutoff her lips. These are Kony's orders. Who's Kony? Who are you with? I'm with Deng over there. Which organization? I'm with the Christian group down in the south. Just up here taking a look around. This isn't a tourist destination. This is a war zone. If you stay here, you're going to get killed. - Thank you for your help. - Get the VT. DENG: Some people say Kony's a wizard. A shape-shifter. He calls himself a Christian, but I say he's Satan who devours his own people. So, Kony is the... he's the leader of the LRA? Yes, he's the one we've been fighting for years. But there's very little we can do. Our weapons are old, our boots full of holes. We've been forgotten by the whole world. What are you doing here? Excuse me? What are you looking for in this place? I ain't looking for nothing. So... you get your picture taken? Go back to your life and all this will be stories you will tell your friends. (SCOFFS) Yeah, maybe. Hey, can I take a look at that gun? - You say she's jamming on you? - Mm-hm. Yeah. Yeah, that's 'cause she's full of dirt Dirt and grit. You gotta strip her down once a day. Keep her well oiled. No wonder she's jamming on you. - Are you military? - Hell no. I just like my guns. (PEOPLE SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) DENG: The night commuters. They come from deep in the bush. Their parents send them out because it's safer to sleep here than in their own homes. Why? Because death comes at night into villages. These are the lucky ones so far. The ones the rebels haven't found yet. Sam. Come on! Get up, let's go. Come on, get up. Let's go. Get up. Hey, get up. Let's go. Get a move on. Get up. Hey, come on. Get up. What are you doing? Let's go. Get up. They ain't sleeping out here. Tell them they're coming inside. Come on, you all get up. - Sam. - Let's go. Sam. There are too many. You can't help them all. Well, I can take these ones here. Yeah. Come on inside. - (CHATTERING) - Come on. Hurry up. I'm coming. Go on. Take a bed. (DENG SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Sam. Sam. The LRA attacked a village last night. You said you wanted to see. (CHATTERING) (HORN HONKING) (CHILDREN SOBBING) (DOG BARKING) (SOBBING) You see any tigers over there? No, I didn't see no tigers. Do they even have tigers over there? (SCOFFS) I don't think so. (TURNS ON WATER) Did you go on a safari? No. I ain't go on no safari. Come on. Let's go to bed. OK... There we go. I'm thinking of a plane. No, no, come on. You gotta get to sleep. Come on, Dad, plane. I'm thinking of a plane. (SIGI-ls) You said plane, I'm thinking of a train. You said train, I'm thinking of a brain. You said brain, I'm thinking of a... - Gotcha. - OK, you got me. OK. You could have said "drain" or "mane," like a horse's hair. Sweet dreams, bug. Good night, Dad. Good night. PAIGE: I'm glad you're home. Coming to bed? Yeah, in a bit. Baby. Baby. What you doing? Making plans. - You been to bed yet? - No. I had a vision last night, Lynn. I know it sounds crazy, but God spoke to me. Here. Take a look at this. Come on, take a look. I'm going to build a church. A church? Yeah. Right across the street. But not a church like Faith United or Calvary Fellowship, you know. A place that ain't gonna turn you away if you're a prostitute or a drug addict or something. A place for sinners just like me, but who want to hear the word of God. How you gonna pay for a church? Well, we got money in the bank, business is good, besides, I own a construction company, so I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal - on the build. - You're crazy. A little bit. Now, here, take a look at this. - (CLEARS THROAT) - What is that? That's the orphanage that I'm gonna build. In Sudan. Frank, make sure that siding's plumb. FRANK: All right, Sam. (UP-TEMPO MUSIC) J' I witness J' I see the cross up on Mount Calvary J' His fight stiff shines in you J' His fight stiff shines in me J' I witness Sam. - Yep. - It's five till and he ain't here. - Call him? - Yeah, I called him. Well, then call him again. J' You found me in darkness and gave me sight J' Your love and Your glory are endless J' Oh, yes, You're here with me J' Guiding me with Your true fight J' Build my heart and make it right J' Your love and Your glory are endless J' Your love and Your glory are endless J' Oh, Lord You're here with me J' (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS, CHEERS) Thank you. Now, you folks are sounding pretty good up here. L gotta say (\IVH|SPERS) Sam. (CLEARS THROAT) Sony. There we go. - How's that? Good? - Good. Well, I'd like to thank you all for coming out today for the first day of worship here at Shekinah Fellowship Church. Thank you. Never really been too keen on talking in front of people. But the guest speaker that we had today, well, he didn't show up, so I thought I would get up and say a few words. OK, well, lot of youse knows me pretty good. Knows I ain't exactly the best seed in the bunch. Maybe you was wondering what made me want to build this here church. I gotta tell you that standing up here right now, I ain't so sure myself. (SAM CLEARS THROAT) But God don't only call the good. I reckon every now and again he calls us sinners, too, and I was about as bad as they come. Bunch of years ago I was in the woods. I was running from some pretty bad fellas. Woods over there by Clean/. And those old boys, they was coming after me pretty hard. Well, I reached in my bag. I was looking for my old shotgun. Well, it was gone. And my mama had took it out when I wasn't looking, and shoved this here bible in there instead. Yes, she did. Well, I figured I was pretty much done for, so I sat down under an oak tree with this useless book in my hand and I just waited. And then the strangest thing happened. Those boys, they just... they ran right on past me. They didn't even see me sitting there. Now, the way I figure it, things would have turned out pretty different if I pulled out that shotgun instead of this here bible. But, you know, it got me thinking. God is looking out for each and every one of you, too. And all you gotta do is just open the door and let him right on in. ALL: Amen! SAM: It's OK, sweetie. I'll be back before you know it. You're gonna miss my play. Mama can videotape it for me. I gotta get. You watch out for them while I'm gone, buddy, OK? That's done, man. (CHATTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You came all the way here to bring us some new boots? OK, OK, OK. OK, right here. Stop the car. Stop the car. DENG: Sam. Sam, wait. It's not safe here. This is it. MAN: This is not a good idea. I think it's a heck of a good idea. It would be better a little further south, towards Kampala. If I wanted to be closer to Kampala, I'd be closer to Kampala. But I want to be right here. (MUTTERS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) What are you saying? What's he saying? Said the north is very dangerous. Villages in this area are very remote, Mr. Childers. There's nothing there. Then I would think that them people would need help the most. This is a war zone, Mr. Childers. The LRA will kill you. Look, I don't think you understand what I'm saying, so let me make it real clear to you. I'm buying this land. This is what can unite us. Arabism cannot unite us. Africanism that is opposed to Orba cannot unite us. Islam cannot unite us. But Sudanism... Sudanism can unite us because it is a common factor. (WOMAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I told you. Stay out of there. You'll get all dirty. You sure you don't want to play someplace else? - No. - No. Come on. - Sam. - Yeah. This is Betty. She's from Kotido. Hey, Betty. How are ya? I'm fine, how are you? I'm OK. DENG: She knows you need someone to run the orphanage. Yeah. I said stay out of there. I'm looking for somebody to help me keep the place in order. Look after things while I'm away. She can do this. And now, what about the children? Can she feed the children? Fix them up when they're sick? Can she do that? (SPEAKS FOREIGN WORD) She's hired.

You can't come with me, buddy. Come on. (IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) William. SA M: In your actions, you give service to the Lord. He's not interested in your good intentions, your good thoughts. No, He wants your backs. Your hands. Your sweat. Your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up His kingdom! - ALL: Amen! - Amen! What do you think? I think it's great. We started daycare last month. Monday through Friday from eight to two. Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it. I'm thinking maybe we could set up a playground. Some swings, some things that kids can climb on. No, we can't build anymore. Not for a while. You said Sundays has been full. Yeah, it's been full, but that doesn't mean people are giving money like today. You know, economy's slow, construction business is slow. Times is tight. Be good for them kids, Lynn. Yeah, well, they got the playground over at Cairnbrook, and they can play at the school on the weekends if they want. No, no. No, I'm talking about Africa. MAN: What I heard, you built yourself one hell of a church over there in Central City. SAM: Yeah, we set it up pretty good, but we still got a ways to go. Anyways, Bill, the reason I called you, the reason I'm here is because I wanted to talk to you a little bit more about our outreach program. You know, the thing we're doing over there in Africa. Of course, I know about what you're doing over there. I mean, hell of a thing, Sam, helping out those kids. God bless you. Thank you, Bill. I appreciate that. I do. But I gotta be straight with you. We are hunting for money. Now, if we had the support of good people like yourselves, sure would help things go a lot smoother over there. Sam. Everybody around here is feeling the pinch. I hear that, Bill. I do. But if you once could see what it is we're doing down there... It's about more than the money. And I ain't asking for a lot. How much are you looking for? Five thousand dollars is all. Jesus Christ, Sam. - Five thousand dollars? - Come on, Bill. That ain't hardly gonna put you out there on the street now, is it? Well, that's not the point. And that's gonna keep them doors open for another six months. Look around here. People are losing their jobs left and right. It's tough to go asking for five thousand dollars for a bunch of African children halfway around the world. Bill, I understand that we got problems right here, but this is a different kind of problem. - Different, how? - That orphanage is the last hope these kids got. Now, with that kind of money, we can feed them kids, house them kids, buy me a new generator, which is sorely needed. I gotta tell you, Bill, you would be saving a hell of a lot of lives. All right. Here's what I'll do. I'll see what I can come up with. - OK. - All right. - OK, Bill. - OK. Hey, why don't you bring the family over next Sunday. We're having a little bit of a barbecue. (UP-TEMPO MUSIC) Well, come on in. You all must be the Childers, welcome. I am Shannon, Bill's ball and chain. I'm Lynn. This here is Paige. Good to meet you. (LAUGHS) There he is. Hey, Sam, glad you all could make it. Oh, who's this lovely young lady? This is Paige. I'll tell you what. You come on in here and you meet some people. This is the gentleman I was telling you about. (MEN SINGING IN SPANISH) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (INAUDIBLE) Sam. There you are. A little something for the kids up there. What we were talking about earlier. - Thank you, Bill. - Yeah, don't mention it. Why are we leaving so soon? Get in the car. - Is everything all right? - Thank you. What is wrong? Son of a bitch is crying poor-mouth to me, and he's living in a damn Taj Mahal. I asked him for $5,000 to feed a bunch of motherless babies, and you know what he gave me? One hundred and fifty bucks. He spent more than that on salsa for his party. We are locked in a fight with the devil. Now, I can't do this on my own. I can't take the pressure and the pain and the loneliness. I need each one of you to back me up. And I need you all to bring your game. - And the Lord will raise you up! - ALL: Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! - ALL: Hallelujah! If we have to cut back, then the devil has won. And we don't want the devil to win, do we? ALL: No! I'm sorry, but $2,500 is the best I can do for those guns. Tell you what. Throw in the car for five. SA M: Almost there. - (BETTY IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) - Hands over eyes. Micrah, no cheating. No cheating. Just a little bit more. OK, stop. Open your eyes. - (CHILDREN SCREAM IN DELIGHT) - SAM: Yeah! Come on. (ALL LAUGHING, SQUEALING) BOY: Thank you. SAM: It's all right. (CHANTING) It's good to see the kids laugh. Amen to that. Listen, I would like to add a few more guards to you during the day. Why? Because Kony's offering money for your heads. - Offering money for my head? - Yes. I must be doing something right. Don't worry about it. I can take care of myself. He said anything yet? All we know is that him and his brother were taken by the rebels. SAM: Where's his brother? DENG: We don't know. You don't want to go play with the other kids? You know, sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside. (CHUCKLES) (EXHALES DEEPLY) I've done a lot of things that I ain't proud of. Hun a lot of people. Truth is helping you kids is about the only good thing I've ever done in this life. But I'm scared that one day I'll... ...close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem. You got no idea what I'm saying, do you? Who's that? (SHOUTING) It's our leader. (EXCITED SHOUTS AND WHISTLES) John Garang? MAN: So they call you the white preacher. Is this what I should call you? You can call me Sam. I hear what you are doing for the children of Sudan and I'm grateful. I just wanted to see myself. Well, this is it. We've got a couple hundred with us here. Feed another thousand a day, nearby villages. And you do this, and yet these are not your people. The struggle is not your own. Yeah, well, I've kinda made it my struggle. Till someone else starts fighting the fight for these children, then I'm the one that's gonna do it. - You're just stubborn, aren't you? - As a mule. I wish I had more men like you. There are peace talks scheduled for the end of August in Naivasha. I would like you to come as my guest. You know, talking about peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time if you ask me. You gotta go out and make it. You speak what is on your mind. I heard this about you. Really? What else did you hear? Well, I heard that you don't suffer fools. And that you like a good fight. I heard you were taller. (JOHN LAUGHS) So, you see, we're not so dissimilar, Sam. You made the fight for these children your struggle, and I made the freedom of Southern Sudan my struggle. But pan of my struggle happens in these rooms. I hear you. So you so think maybe we could convince you to come to peace talks one day? Maybe. Should be coming up soon. Anybody see anything? Marco! See something? MARCO: Nothing. Nothing. I don't know. Should be around here. You should pull over. DENG: The intel was very clear. SAM: I don't see nothing. This is it. No, wait, wait. There. I got two. Right there. (\IVH|STLES) Come on. Come on, it's OK. Come on. OK, they ain't moving. A.J., Nineteen, go get those kids. Deng.

But what I want to ask everyone out there, everyone that has a child, everyone that has a brother or a sister, if your child or your family member was abducted today, if a madman came in, a terrorist came in, abducted your family member or your child, and if I said to you, I can bring your child home... does it matter how I bring 'em home? © © © P © P@ © P@r © P@rM © P@rM! © P@rM!N © P@rM!Nd © P@rM!Nde © P@rM!NdeR © P@rM!NdeR © P@rM!NdeR M © P@rM!NdeR M@ © P@rM!NdeR M@n © P@rM!NdeR M@nk © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖ © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖÖ © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖÖ © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖÖ ™
