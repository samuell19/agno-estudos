Everything left exactly as it was? All except the body. We took that away. - Where is it? It's a fortnight since Lee was killed. It's very, very hot in India. - I see. Did it make a nice fire? - As a matter of fact, Inspector .. There was more warmth in that cremation than there ever was in Lee's heart. He must have been a nice chap. - He was rotten. I should like to have seen the body. - Nothing you could learn by it. A knife wound in the back through the heart. As I told you, we have not found the knife. That is the room where Lee was killed. No. That door is locked. The entrance is over here. Alright. Open the door. I've kept the place locked and under guard ever since the murder. What was that? - What? I thought I heard something. [ Female scream sounds ] I had forgotten that idiot bird. You'd better switch on the lights before we frighten ourselves to death. This outline. Is this where you found him? - Yes. Lying on his face. A tea service for two. Apparently they didn't drink any. Probably Lee was about to serve tea when .. When he was stabbed. In the back, you said. Yes. On the left side. Near the heart. Rather comfortable quarters these. Was Lee well-to-do? Moderately. Lived here for five years. Seemed to know everybody. Who were his close friends? - Well. I have only been able to find one. John Wales. John Wales, eh? Wales? That's the man you say annoyed you so? - Annoyed me? The man is a fanatic. He comes to my office every day. 'Why can't I do this'? 'Why can't I do that'? It does seem strange to me that .. I've been unable to get hold of anything. The dozen people most seen with Lee are close to the governor. With no proof to go on, I can't put pressure on people of that sort. I see. So that's why I am here. Well, Inspector. - That's alright. That's alright. Tell me more about this man Wales. - I can't make him out. Of course, he might be putting on a show in order to .. To cover himself. You are wrong, Grimshaw. Mr Wales. I asked you not to interfere. Grimshaw. Wait just a moment. So you're John Wales. I understood this house was locked. It is. - I have a key. You must have been very near to Lee to be trusted with a key. I was. It was you who saw a veiled woman leave this house on the night of the murder. Yes. But you didn't recognise her. - Not quite. What are you doing here tonight? - Tonight? I've been here night after night. Hoping to find something. Hoping that woman would come back. Hoping I'd find the murderer. That is my job too. Inspector Marney has come out here from Scotland Yard. We'll find the murderer. You kind of investigation won't do the slightest good. You have a better idea? - Yes. My plan, might sound somewhat fantastic to you. You'll find sometimes the police are quite reasonable people. You might be. - Thank you. Living in town is a very remarkable woman. Madam La Grange. A medium. - A medium? She's the most extraordinary medium I've ever seen. I want her to hold a seance. - You what? That's the way to catch the murderer. Mr Wales. You can't go into court and say so-and-so is a murderer .. Because Madam La Grange says he is. Have you ever been to a seance? - Yes. You know what it's like. You know the tension. The mystery and the fear. I see. A sort-of psychological trap. Well, it might work. - Then call up Sir Roscoe. Ask to have it in the residency. - Sir Roscoe? The Governor? If the governor invites the people I want, they will come. Very well. Grimshaw, call him at once. - I can't call at this time of night. I did not realize it was so late. - That is alright. I can wait until the morning. But don't you think this is a bit irregular, Grimshaw? Yes. Yes. I appreciate your point of view. Certainly, I am interested in solving the crime. No. It's quite alright. You may tell Wales I will at least listen to him. Not at all. Fifteen two. Four and two pairs makes eight. There, I make the turn. What did Mr Grimshaw want, Roscoe? The Leonard Lee case. Has Wales' veiled woman been identified? - No. I don't think so. I am glad. I hope she never is. Everyone would be happier if she were never identified. I agree with you absolutely. Dad, that fellow was an out-and-out rotter. Lionel, I wish you wouldn't call father 'Dad'. What else can a man call his wife's father? I won't run around calling him 'Your Excellency'. 'Dad' is alright. I like it. My son calls me worse things than that. No. I asked you a simple question and I want a simple answer. The simple answer is 'No'. Better make it 'Yes'. Will you marry me? No. Will you marry me? Dick. Dick, please don't. Darling, you meant yes, didn't you? It's so hard to say now. - It's ridiculous. Dick. There's so many things I want to tell you. That you love me? Then what? You see. - I know. Where can my mother get a new secretary? - That's it. There's something in that. Come on. Give me just one good reason. I don't like you very much. Whoever heard of a reason like that? Darling. Why? You don't know anything about me. I would not quite say that. You're such a fool. - That's the general idea. About you. Take it off. Take it easy. We'll have it off in a minute, old boy. A very excellent trick. - Professor, you are terrific. It is nothing, Miss Eastwood. Just a trick I learned in Thug country. Nothing? It's marvelous. That act would be a sensation on any London stage. I had an excellent target. Dr. Mason has a delightfully long neck. I assure you it isn't delightful, Miss Eastwood. I just spent two years in the jungle. And the length of my neck made me somewhat self-conscious. You have overwhelmed your audience, professor. Look. My sister is very nervous. She is very easily upset. There, there. Come along now. I am very sorry. The reason I gave you this little demonstration. Was to how you the way a native Thug kills his enemy. He never spills blood. Oh? So you don't think it was a native who polished off Lee? I think, Mr Stanby, it was neither a native nor a man. I am so sorry. John, it is both my duty and my desire to help. But when you want to call in a fortune-teller to solve a murder. Not a fortune teller. A medium. Is any medium going to uncover the killer of that bounder? That bounder. Was my best friend. I am sorry. So am I. I'm going to find out who killed him. John, if I didn't know you so well I'd say you were crazy. And knowing me so well? I think Lee's death has become a mania with you. It has. It's so impolitic for English officials to be connected with such mumbo-jumbo. My servants will talk. It will get all over the district. It's all over the district now. It is whispered that the British Raj has decided to hush up this crime. For reasons of its own. Have one? No thanks. I'll let you invite these people. But I simply can't reconcile myself to the idea. Why did you select them? For instance, I invited Stanby and his sister and the Hindu professor. Because I saw all three of them at the Colony Club at the time Lee was killed. Well? Not wanting the murderer to know why we're all here tonight. We have at least three people who are beyond suspicion. Governor. Dick, what's on your mind? - I have got something I .. Hello Mr Wales. - Good evening, Dick. Father. - Father? This must be serious. Would you like me to .. - It's alright. You'll hear it anyway. I know she's too good for me and she's not really given me an answer yet. But the Crosbys refuse to take 'no' for an answer. That's it. I've asked Nell to marry me. I see. If Nell says 'Yes'. I shall say 'splendid'. Governor, you are swell. - Hmm. Very American. But rather gratifying. I'll announce the engagement tonight. - You'd better tell your mother. She will be delighted. - I am on my way. Dick. - Yes? Will you do something for me? - Say the word. I'm in the mood. Don't announce your engagement tonight. - Don't announce my ..? Why? - I say, John. I know it sounds ridiculous and presumptuous. But I ask you to put it off until tomorrow. I've accorded you tremendous liberties, John. But even friendship has its limitations. - I do this because of our friendship. I don't know about all this but you've anything to say about Nell .. Dick. I have excellent reasons for what I say. 24 hours can't make so much difference. - Mr Wales, it's not the 24 hours. I know you think you have a reason for what you're doing but .. David. Wait. Sir Roscoe. I'm afraid that Mr Wales is right. Nell. - Nonsense. No, Sir Roscoe. Darling, I asked you to wait. But Nell, what is it? Why? Well, I'd rather not talk about it just now. Wales, this is a ridiculous situation. You must explain. - I can't until tomorrow. Trust me. I'm the one that should be explained to. Dick. I'd give anything not to do this. I can say nothing until tomorrow. Look here, Wales. - Dick, please wait. Thank you, Miss O'Neill. Yes. That's what she is, so I've heard. A well-known local medium. A medium? That sounds fun. She comes here, mother? - I believe so. Splendid. I shall have a few words with my great aunt Martha. That will be fun. - How terribly exciting. Too terribly. - Lionel, behave yourself. Major Trent, don't tell me you haven't any faith. That depends on what you mean by 'faith'. I think that having faith is believing in something that you know to be untrue. Stanby, that is very good. Perhaps I shouldn't have said it. What is the medium's name, Lady Crosby? I don't know. Mr Wales arranged it. The name is Rosalie La Grange. What a ridiculous name. - I think it's very pretty. I think we should decide what we're going to ask her. I'd like to speak to Cleopatra. I've always wanted to say a few kind words to Josephine. Why not ask something we'd really like to know? Why not? Let's ask her to put us through to Leonard Lee. What would you ask Leonard Lee .. If the medium did find him? I should ask him who put the knife in his back. So would everyone else. Except me. I would ask him why it wasn't put in sooner. I am sorry, Stanby. But I don't think that's very funny. Mem-Sahib La Grange is here. Ask her to come in. Would you come in please? Good evening to you, Mr Wales. - Good evening. How do you do, Madam La Grange? Fair to middling, thank you, ma'am. A touch of stiffness in my left shoulder. Arthritis. - I am sorry. Very painful. Madam La Grange, have you some wonderful tricks to play on us tonight? I don't play tricks, ma'am. That is, not more than any woman does. Oh come. We know all about how you get the effect of spirits rapping. Do you now? You have to be near a table or something like that. Any piece of furniture that you can rap your knuckles against. There in the dark. - Of course. In the dark. And you get one rap for 'yes'. Two for 'no'. The same old stuff. May I get the lady a whisky and soda? Don't laugh please. Are the spirits near me now? [ One rap. ] But how did you do that? - Please be quiet. Is it you, Laughing- Eyes? [ One rap. ] You can't talk to me in the light? [ One rap. ] Are you happy, Laughing-Eyes? [ Two raps. ] Is there someone here you don't like? [ One rap. ] A gentleman? [ Two raps. ] Oh dear. It must be a lady. Is that the woman? [ One rap. ] Laughing-Eyes don't like you, ma'am. It's not a trick. She just stood there. I watched her hands every minute. You watched the wrong end of me, mister. I have a wooden sole in my shoe. You do it with your foot. Like this. [ One rap. ] I told you the whole thing was nothing but tricks. Madam La Grange, don't you think it's rather a mean thing to do? To trick poor ignorant people like us? I don't often use tricks, ma'am. Except to show it is done. Like now. But sometimes. I give advice. Oh, you do? Yes. I do. And if I was you, ma'am, I would go back to my husband. But Madam La Grange, Mary isn't married. Her husband waits for her in England. And he loves her still. And if I was you I would go back to him. Why not tell her she is wrong? How did you know? You left your handbag in the hall. While I waited I read the letter in it. Sorry if I frightened you. Very clever of you, Madam La Grange. Sorry if I hurt the young lady's feelings. Is that what it is? All trickery? - Yes, ma'am. It is. I tell you most of the time it is tricks but .. There have been times in my life when .. Those times it wasn't tricks. Things powerful. Wonderful. Messages from them that have passed before. The devil of it is, ma'am. It's not a thing you can talk of clear. I think I understand. You know, ma'am. I thought you might. Madam La Grange. Do you think the power will come to you tonight? She proved the whole thing is nothing but tricks. I vouch for Madam La Grange. Thank you, sir. I assure you, whatever madam La Grange does tonight, it will be quite honest. Then, if we get any messages .. If you get any messages. They'll be true messages. I admit that most of the time it is a fake. Even with me. But tonight there will be no faking. Madam La Grange, some years ago .. I saw Paladino lift a table just by putting her hands on it. Take those things away, will you? I know this trick. You put your hands on the table and your thumbs under the edge. Sometimes you do it that way. Sometimes. Like this. I say. I say. Now you know. When I go into a trance it will be a real trance. And no fake. My spirit controls a little girl. Her name is 'Laughing-Eyes'. Wait. Wait. Something is coming to me. Don't anyone speak. It's no use. Laughing-Eyes won't come through. It is the unbelievers here. Most of you don't believe in it. It's hard to get messages through that way. Maybe it will be easier when we get in the dark. Of course, Madam La Grange. We all know it is easier in the dark. There's lots of things some people do in the dark they wouldn't do in daylight. Shall we go ahead with it? Just a minute. Do you mind if the doors and windows in this room are locked? Why not, sir? I suggest we search Madam La Grange. That is, of course, if she is willing. I am willing. There are no holes in my stockings. You know, I do not understand you. I just showed you how my tricks are done. Would I do that if I'd wanted to fool you? Of course not. Why can't you give me credit for being honest? It's not that any of us doubt your honesty. But some of us are a little sceptical. - Thank you, ma'am. Well, now let's get on with the search. I don't think that is necessary. - I do, ma'am. I think I'd like all the ladies to come. I don't want to leave a doubt in anyone's mind. Come, children. I believe that woman has a power of some sort. Do you really I should be able to talk to Josephine? I should imagine so. And Josephine will talk to you. No. - Yes. Really. I've seen it happen. No. Not really, talk to me? Yes, of course. Why not? Josephine was my pet cat. The girls are so disappointed, Madam La Grange .. Not to find something concealed on you. I knew they would search me, ma'am. So I left my ghosts at home. And took the trap door from my sleeve. May I help you? - Thank you, Miss. Ask the gentlemen to place the chairs in a circle, ma'am. I'll be down directly. I'm awfully anxious to see what will happen. So am I. I have no time to talk now. But whatever happens. Remember not to say one word. Why didn't you .. - I wouldn't have come for the world. Nothing would have dragged me. But if they have to have a medium, better be me than anyone else. I will tell them. - No. Whatever happens, I do not want one word from you. Understand? You don't think .. - Listen. There is hate in this house. I can feel it in my blood. Something is going to happen. Ready, Nell? - We just finished. Did I leave my compact somewhere? Is that it, Miss? Yes. Thank you. I'll go with you. - Good. Wales, you're not really going to try to speak to Lee, are you? You object? The thing is about done. Why bring it all up again? You're not interested in justice? The man had it coming to him. He'd asked for it. - To be murdered? Sir Roscoe. I hope you don't think it rude of me if I leave before the ladies return. Why? I have an almost superstitious distaste for things of this sort. I am sorry, Professor. But I would consider it rude. I am very sorry. Making yourself beautiful to attract Leonard's ghost? Perhaps his ghost has better taste than Leonard had when he was alive. Chotee. Take care of this backdoor key. And lock this door from the outside. Is the door locked? - Yes, sahib. Now I think we're all ready. The circle satisfactory? Yes. Now, if you will all sit down. Will you sit here, Madam La Grange? Certainly. I suppose you and your son are going to sit each side of me. If you do not mind. I don't mind. He is a very good-looking young man. Will you sit here, Miss O'Neill? I was going to sit .. - Please sit here. Don't we hold hands or something equally jolly? That will be when the lights are off. Miss Stanby. Will you hold my hand? Wait, Mr Wales. Don't sit down. There are thirteen of us here. Thirteen is a lucky number, ma'am. To them who has done no evil. Now. Are we alright? Will you all join hands. And then when we are in the dark, just ease your minds. Don't try to think of anything. Put the lights out now? - Yes please, sir. Dick. Dick. When I say the word put out that light. Right, sir. - And when we're in the dark. Don't be frightened if I cry out or moan. Or even if I scream. I don't even know I do it. The trance takes me that way sometimes. How shall we know when ..? Don't worry, ma'am. You'll know it when she's here. And when she begins to talk you can ask her anything you want. I think that is alright. All be quiet now. And turn out the lights, sir. Dick, I think you'd better close that blind. Yes. I think it would be better, sir. I've been to seances before. It was always considered good taste. To have the medium tied to the chair. Certainly not, Mary. Don't be ridiculous. If you don't mind, ma'am. I would rather have it that way. You're sure you don't mind? If you please, sir. I don't want those who don't believe to think I'm tricking. What about handkerchiefs? - Yes. That's fine I think. May we have two more? - Here is one. I hope you don't mind, Madam La Grange. You do everything you're asked, don't you? Such gentlemen would not ask me to do anything I shouldn't do. That's very good. Now. If you switch out that light, sir. You will have to reach over to take my hands. That is fine. Now, will everybody take their neighbours' hands. No break in the circle. All keep quite quiet please. And keep your minds free. That is all you've got to do. Then. I think. I think. Laughing-Eyes. Laughing-Eyes is very sad. So far away. So far. He is unhappy. Leonard. Leonard. Oh, my .. Leonard. Leonard wants to talk to .. To talk. To .. - Who? Who does he want? He wants to tell .. About the letters. And the pain. Like a burning fire in the back. What is in the back? Ask him. What was in the back? He wants. John. What do you want? The swimming pool. Long ago. Don't forget. When we were boys? The time I almost drowned? John. Promised. - What did I promise? John was drowning. Leonard. I remember. You saved my life. I promised to do anything in the world you wanted. Leonard. What do you want of me? The letters. - What letters? Someone came. In the back. - Leonard, who came? Ask. Ask. - Who came? Leonard. Tell me who killed you. Do you know who killed him? John. He wants John. Do you know who killed you? Ask. Ask. Leonard. Tell me who killed you. Tell me the name. Leonard. Tell me who killed you. Ask. Ask. - Leonard. Tell me who killed you. Wales. Wales? Wales. Ask him. Ask him again. Wales. John. What is it? What's the matter? Father, I am frightened. - Dick. The lights. Wales. - Look at him. Wales, what's the matter? What is it, doctor? The man is dead. Grimshaw. - Evening, Sir Roscoe. This is Inspector Marney. - How do you do. That is the body? That is an exact duplicate of the knife wound we found in Leonard Lee's back. I say, Inspector. - Yes? Shouldn't you take our names and let us go? It was my idea to keep everyone here until I find out who killed this man. See here, sir. We've been waiting a long time for you in this room. With that. I got here just as soon as I could. What I mean is this. I'm not going to stay here any longer. It won't be necessary to keep anyone waiting. If you will just tell me who did this. Perhaps you do not realise that my brother is Lord Kelton. You mean, you refuse to remain any longer? I absolutely refuse to. Very well, Mr Stanby. Brother of Lord Kelton. You are arrested as a material witness in this case. Grimshaw. Take this gentleman into custody. I don't like to do this, Mr Stanby. - Just a moment. I beg your pardon, Inspector. I feel I made rather a fool of myself. Quite alright, Mr Stanby. Quite alright. But after all, this is a murder case, you know. Well. What is this? - She won't let us untie her. Madam La Grange. How did you know? Wales told me. We'll untie you now. - Thank you. I'm comfortable as I am. But surely .. - No. No. Let things remain as they are for the present. The status quo, Inspector. That is Latin. I say. Yes? Well. Quite an abundance of handkerchiefs. I believe that is mine. Will you .. Sorry. What is your name? Dr. Mason, Inspector. Will you return the handkerchief to the young lady, Dr. Mason. Thank you. Sir Roscoe. How did this happen? Wales was asking questions during the seance. Suddenly, he did not speak anymore. When my son turned on the lights. Wales toppled over to the floor. That's all I know. Isn't it customary during a seance to hold hands? Yes. And when the lights came on they were still holding hands? Yes. We were. The circle was unbroken. You told me your son switched on the lights. Yes. Look here, Inspector. - That's exactly what I am doing. I am looking everywhere. I want to find the murderer. I'm sorry, but .. When my father called for lights I got up and switched them on. I assure you I didn't have time to go and kill Wales and get back to the lamp. No. Possibly not. That door was bolted when I came here. Yes. We've all been locked in this room since the beginning of the seance. And the windows? - Fastened. If Wales was right someone in this room killed Leonard Lee. But whether he was right or wrong .. Someone in this room. Killed Wales. Of course, it would make much simpler if the murderer would confess. Well, I really didn't expect it. I would like to take a look at the knife. Well? There was no knife. The room was locked. There must be a knife. Someone in this room has a knife. You may as well give it up now. We'll find it in the end. Very well. Grimshaw. Have the matron come up here and search everybody. Send two men up here to search the room. Was it your idea to be tied up like that? No, sir. It was not. That young lady was kind enough to suggest it. That is right, Inspector. It is a lucky thing for you. Even though she could get out of those things she couldn't get back into them. The world is improving. Just imagine. A policeman with brains. Get me loose, Inspector dear. My foot is asleep. Inspector. - Yes? Must we stay here .. With that? - I'm afraid we must. Someone in this room has a knife. You're going to be searched. In the meantime. Take your places as you were during the seance. Must we? Take your places. Please. No, Miss. You were there. And you were there. It seems rather strange. I was next to Major Trent. - Yes. That is right. No, no. I was not next to that chair. You were sitting here. Of course. How stupid of me. Yes. You were sitting there and I was here. Did you suggest where they were to sit? No, sir. I did not. - I vouch for that, Inspector. Sorry I made that mistake about the young ladies. I think we are all a bit jittery. Anyone might make a mistake. - That is alright. If they couldn't remember where they sat I can't say who can be blamed for that. Sir Roscoe. You told me that Wales was asking questions during the seance. What questions? He was asking for the name of the murderer of Leonard Lee. Did you have reason to believe that name would be forthcoming? Yes. I did. There's somebody in this room who did not want that name spoken. Dr. Mason. You were a friend of Wales, weren't you? Yes I was. - But you hated Leonard Lee. What difference does that make? - That makes a lot of difference. The same person that killed Wales. Killed Lee also. You hated Lee. I hardly knew the man, Inspector. You came out of the jungle the day before Lee was killed. Yes. I suppose I did. But why should I want to kill Lee? I can tell you why. You were a reasonably happy and prosperous physician in England. Until Lee met your wife. Inspector. You're in line for a knighthood on the next honours day. But your wife couldn't wait. She brought divorce suit against you. You contested it. The subsequent scandal drove you out of your profession. It drove you out of England. Alright, Inspector. I did hate Lee. I loathed him and I would have killed him if I'd had the chance. Someone got there before me. - Who? I don't know. I can't have killed Wales as my hands were held until the lights went on. These ladies can confirm that. - Yes, Inspector. Sit down, Doctor. Sit down. You two ladies were sitting .. Next to the dead man. You knew Leonard Lee, didn't you? Before. Several years ago. You were about to say, before you were married? Inspector. I think that is just about enough of that. Yes. Yes. Perhaps. For the present. Madam La Grange. You will come with me please. Sir Roscoe said that during the seance, Wales was asking you for a name. Why didn't you give it to him? - I don't know, sir. I was in a trance. - But you heard the question. How could I? - I didn't ask that. Why not give him the name as planned? - Planned? The entire seance was rehearsed. Wales told me. He thought he knew who the veiled woman was. During the seance you would repeat her name. To force a confession from her. Why didn't you complete your part of it? I don't know what you mean. Wales told you the name you were to speak. What was that name? - I know nothing about it. He must have forgot to tell it to me. - What was that name? There was no name. He did not give me any name. Alright. Come on back. Lady Crosby, what is your first name please? Alicia. And yours? - Mary. And what is your name? Oh dear. My sister's name is Grace. Mrs Trent? - Helen. And yours? - Nell. That is short for 'Helen'? Yes. - I see. There are two Helens here. Sir Roscoe. When Madam La Grange first came here tonight. Did she display any reaction at the sight of any particular person here? I can't help you there. I was in the library with Miss O'Neill and my son. I see. Then Miss O'Neill was not here. I want you to all try and remember. Did Madam La Grange and Miss O'Neill give signs of recognition .. When they first saw each other? Inspector. I saw a kind of recognition between the young lady and the medium. What do you mean by that? - The young lady seemed startled. And the medium suddenly raised her hands said: 'Don't anyone speak'. Thank you. What is this girl to you? What do you mean? - Why try to fool me? You didn't want me to know Miss O'Neill sat next to Wales. Why shield her? Who is she? - I don't know. Grimshaw. Put this woman under arrest. - Right. What for? General complicity. I want her record looked up. Leave her alone. Leave her alone I tell you. You can't do this to her. - Darling, don't lose your head. The woman must give her evidence like everyone else. The woman will give her evidence like everyone else. And not under arrest. 'The woman', as you call her is .. Is my mother. Nell. You shouldn't have told them. You didn't ought to have told them. Nell, was that your secret? You are silly, darling. I wanted to tell you. But she would not let me. I didn't want to shame her. You should have told us. You don't mind the kind of old mother the poor dear has? Mind? My dear. You have a grand fellow, Nellie darling. This is very charming. In case you forgotten it, we still have a corpse on our hands. Now, Miss O'Neill. Inspector. You're not accusing my little girl of murder? Miss O'Neill was sat next to Wales. All she had to do was free one hand, strike, and then take his hand again. She had to do something else before she could ever do that. What? She had to have murder in her heart. Miss O'Neill, did you know Leonard Lee? No. Wales told me that Lee had a habit of .. Saving letters written to him by ladies. Did you ever write any letters to Leonard Lee? How could I if I didn't know him? [ Door knocks ] Alright, Grimshaw. Sahib and Mem Sahib of the police ask to see Inspector Marney. Very well. We'll postpone this conversation until after the search. One at a time please. Miss O'Neill. You would be first. Grimshaw, you take charge of the men. See that this room is thoroughly searched. The whole thing is totally outrageous. They've searched us already. Why do they keep me here? And you? Never mind, Grace. Never mind. It's your move, Grace. I can't. Gracie, don't take it so seriously. A prisoner in your own house. - Hold on to yourself, Lionel. You might take a little of your own advice, my darling. Lionel. There's something I simply have to tell you and I don't know how. I don't think you need to tell me. Then you .. I have known it for a long time. Did you ..? - Listen to me. Take hold of yourself. No matter what happens, don't say anything. Do you understand? That's ridiculous, Grimshaw. - We searched everyone to the skin. Turned the room inside out. I tell you there's no knife. Young Crosby is the logical one. The O'Neill girl could have asked him to get rid of the knife for her. I think you're wrong about that girl. She seems to me to be a very nice young person. Very comforting to hear you say that. One of the nicest girls I ever knew sliced up four husbands. Let's have Miss Eastwood in here. - Alright. Stop where you are please. It is worth twenty pounds to me if the inspector never hears about this. My orders are to report anybody leaving the house. Go and get back. Back where you came from. Go on. Get ahead. I must tell you that ten letters written by you were found in Lee's effects. He told me he'd burned them. - Then you were in love with him? Not at the end. You killed him for the letters. - I did not. I swear I didn't. He was alive when I left him. And you had a little tete-a-tete. A tea for two. We didn't have tea. I only asked him for the letters and he said he had burned them. Then. Then I left. But. But what? I saw somebody else come in. - Who? She was veiled. And? It looked like. Miss O'Neill. Are you sure? I think so. [ Door knocks ] This gentleman was trying to get away. Come in. Come in, professor. That is all for the moment. The gentleman was trying to get away you say? Yes. I found him leaving the garden. - Thank you. That is all. You may return to your post. A nice record. I have nothing to say. - Well, I have. When Lee died there was a cheque in his safe for ?500 signed by you, professor. Yes. A gambling debt. Lee was blackmailing you. Yes. What did he have on you? Out with it. We'll find it out anyway. I was in Dartmoor prison for six years. Forgery. I see. So you do have a nice record. That is why I didn't want people to be digging up my past. You did not like Lee very much. I didn't kill him, Inspector. I was at the Colony Club at the time he was killed. You were a friend of Wales, weren't you? Yes. Wales had a fine mind. Did Wales ever tell you whom he suspected? Yes. Who? - Miss O'Neill. That's why he made her sit next to him at the seance. What's the matter, darling? Dick. I am so scared. - You mustn't worry. They're bound to find out the truth. Yes. Nell. There's something else, isn't there? You have to tell me. I can't. Darling, do you not understand? I want to help you. You can't, Dick. Darling. You know I love you. I know. Tomorrow morning. Will you marry me? There is nothing in the world I want more. But we have to wait. Waiting is alright for the old. But it's no good for the young. My advice to you, young woman. Is to grab that boy while you can get him. Very sound advice too. Listen to me. There is something I want you to do for me. I know I've not been much of a mother to you. You have been the best mother in the world. That is not what I'm talking about. There is something on your mind. There is something you're holding back. You should tell it to your young man and your mother. What is it, Choti? The Inspector says he would like Miss O'Neill to come to see him. I want to speak to Miss O'Neill alone. Sit down. Sit down please. You realize, I suppose, that you are under very grave suspicion? If you are innocent the best thing for you to do is to be very frank with me. I told you. There is nothing more I can say. Better tell me everything you know. Inspector. - You keep out of this, Crosby. You did know Leonard Lee, didn't you? And you were at his house that night. No. He served you some tea. You were the last one to see him alive. No. Yes. And you saw him dead also. When he turned to pour himself a cup of tea, you killed him. You don't have to answer, deary. - You weren't asked to come in. I'm the young lady's mother. You don't have to say anything, deary. I know the law if the inspector doesn't. You have a right to refuse to answer questions. And you have a right to see a lawyer. If she is innocent, she will tell me everything she knows. Here they are, Inspector. Do they compare? - Yes. I'm afraid they do. Miss O'Neill, I arrest you for the murder of Leonard Lee. You can't do it. She never killed him. There is the teacup found in Lee's room. Her fingerprints are on it. I never touched the cup. Thank you. You put those prints on it to trap her. - There are no fingerprints on the cup. But we did trap her. Don't be frightened, deary. Tell me. Why was you there? You were there, weren't you? Yes. What if she was? She went for some good reason. Why did you go there, deary? I can't tell you. She was there when Lee died. She sat next to Wales when he was killed. That is enough. It's not enough, Inspector. She'll tell you. Make her tell you. Nell, darling. You know that we trust you. And we know you have nothing to be ashamed of. May I speak to them alone? No. Why can't you tell us now? I know. Nellie. You're shielding someone. No, no. - You have to tell us. I can't. I promised. If you're shielding someone let me say that no-one risks hanging for a promise. She does not have to tell. Because I know. Oh. It is blind I've been. And you are a fine detective, Inspector. It was you who found out about the two Helens. You should know as plain as your face it's the other Helen she's shielding. I think it is time for you to speak, Miss O'Neill. Listen, darling. If it's my sister you are protecting, the truth has got to come out. You simply have to talk, Nell. Did you go there for Helen? You can speak now, deary. It's out already. What did she send you for? Some letters. Why didn't she not go herself? She was afraid. - And what were those letters? Well. While Lionel was away last year. Helen became involved with Leonard Lee. She wrote some silly letters. He wouldn't return them to her. He wanted her to come for them. She would not go to his house so .. So I went. What happened then, Miss O'Neill? Well, Mr Lee was very angry. I told him if he didn't give them to me I would tell Sir Roscoe. Finally, he went to a cabinet, got the letters and threw them at me. I picked them up from the floor. And came home. You mean to tell me that a man like Lee would .. Give those letters to the first stranger that asked for them? No jury would ever believe that. - Jury? You are not ..? You've got no proof. - I have proof enough. If she were innocent, why did she wait until now .. To tell me this beautiful story? She was protecting the young man's sister. She was protecting herself. She wrote those letters. He was blackmailing her. When he wouldn't return the letters she killed him. As for Wales. She was afraid he would find out about her having killed Lee. She was sat next to Wales. All she had to do was free one hand and strike him. Then take his hand again. - So what did she do with the knife? That's what I was about to ask. If we find that out we'll clear up the whole case. Where are you going? - To get my sister. You will wait. Grimshaw. You bring Mrs Trent. I'd like to question her myself. It's going to be alright, dear. Dick. I can't face Helen. Now darling. I feel so horrible. You shouldn't. She has been so kind to me. Ever since I was a little girl. I know. Helen. Helen has been like my own sister. - Of course, dear. As soon as she found out you needed her testimony she would have come forward. Helen, I tried. I wanted Mrs Trent. What did you want to see her about? - Lionel. Please leave Helen here alone. I think we can allow the major to remain. Mrs Trent. Did you ask this girl to go to Mr Lee's house to get the letters you'd sent him? Inspector, what the devil are you talking about? Did you, Mrs Trent? - Of Course not. Helen. Sid down, Miss O'Neill. Sit down. Did you ever write any letters to Leonard Lee? Inspector, you can't make insinuations of this kind. Never mind, Lionel. I don't know what you're talking about. I never wrote Leonard Lee any letters. Thank you, Mrs Trent. That is all. Wait. She knew Leonard Lee. Nell did not. Apparently that is not so. Helen, you're lying to save yourself. You must tell the truth. Dick. That's alright, Mrs Trent. Thank you again. Well. That settles it. She can't do it, Inspector. - Grimshaw. Take Miss O'Neill along. - It's too bad, Miss. She never did it, I tell you. I'm sorry but the evidence is against her. Inspector, don't you see? Don't you see? You're making a fool of yourself. I think we've had enough of this. I didn't mean it that way. I don't know what I am saying but .. Inspector. I can find out something. I swear I can. Just give me a few minutes. There's nothing you can do. It's a waste of time. Then give me a few minutes waste of time. Why not, Inspector? We can't get out of here. Just a few minutes. Please, Inspector. Well. Alright. Thank you. Would you leave me alone? And put out the light. Laughing-Eyes. Laughing-Eyes, if you could only help me. We've been tricking people and deceiving people all our lives. We've been fakes from beginning to end. And now. Now, when I want to do the real thing. When my child's life depends on it. You're no good to me at all. If only those who've passed before .. Could come back and bring me a real message for once in my life. Laughing-Eyes. Are we going to let ourselves be beaten by a scheming, cold-hearted murderer? [ Two raps. ] I didn't do that. I didn't do it. It has come. After all these years. It's come. A real. Message. Laughing-Eyes. You wasn't fooling me, was you? [ Two raps. ] Glory be. It is real. I knocked twice but you didn't hear me. I heard you. But it was a message just the same. A message? What do you mean? Look. Now all you have to do, Inspector. Is to find the fingerprints on the knife. And let my girl go free. Grimshaw. It's alright. It's alright. We found the knife. Laughing-Eyes and me. Who did it? - I don't know. They are looking for the fingerprints. That's right, my darling. Cry. It will do you good. - Madam La Grange. The Inspector wants to see you. Well, Inspector. Who did it? There are no fingerprints on it. It's as clean as a mirror. You can't use a knife without holding it. Yes. It might have been held in a handkerchief. Then all you have to do is find the one who owns the handkerchief. When I first came in the room tonight. Miss O'Neill's handkerchief was lying on the floor. Is that the one? Yes. - May I? A drop of blood. That is all. Thank you, Madam La Grange. Grimshaw. Look after Miss O'Neill. Wait, wait. Inspector. Inspector, wait. Wait. Please say you will do it. Give me this one more chance. I cannot be doing that all night. - But it .. It's a mother begging for her daughter's life. I admire your spirit but .. What you want is impossible. It was me that found the knife that condemned her. You must understand that what you want me to do is inhuman. Horrible. There is a murderer loose in this house and you're holding an innocent girl. I give you a chance to find the real murderer. I'm sorry but that is not so. - It is so. What about Mason? You said yourself that Lee drove him out of England and ruined him. He admitted that he hated the man. And Major Trent. His wife did have something to do with Lee. You can see he's crazy about her. So what about him? What about her? You know she is hiding something. What about all the rest of them? Any one of them had more reason to kill Lee than my poor girl had. Very well. But don't take your oath in court that no stone was left unturned. Well. I hope it works. You will let me do it? If you can prove that someone else killed Wales .. You're a better man than I am. Are you ready? Yes. Alright, Grimshaw. You may come in now please. Will you all sit in a circle please and join hands. Inspector, I see absolutely no necessity for this sort of thing. It's ridiculous. Sir Roscoe, must we? I am sorry. Inspector Marney is in charge. Please, all take your places. All take the same places please. Inspector, this is outrageous. Take that body out of here. It's awful. This is not investigation. This is sheer brutality. The innocent should have no fear of the dead. Take your places, please. Father. Marney, is it necessary that my daughter sits there? I don't think it makes any difference. Thank you. Suppose you change places with your brother? I see no reason for this. - There is a reason, sir. I feel it in my soul. That his spirit is going to come to us. There is one thing more. I want you all to remember. Each one of you. The feel of your neighbour's hand. If it seems to grip too tightly or too loosely. If it seems too nervous or stiff. Because the action .. Of the hand may give the murderer away. Ready Madam La Grange? Yes. Inspector. I don't mind you being out of the circle, but .. Will you stand by the table when you put the light out? Don't move again until it is over. - Very well. Mother. Will I have to take .. his hand? Yes. You will. It's alright, dear. See. Now. The lights please, Inspector. Now. Will you all hold each other's hands. Is everybody holding his neighbour's hand? Be quiet please. It is ghastly. - Quiet. Trying. To reach. Far. He must. Wales. John Wales. He is trying to show. To show you. Stop it. Stop this. - Be quiet please. He is trying so hard. Mother. He is moving. He will show you. Mother. There. It didn't work. I thought the murderer would speak. Everyone stay where they are please. Dr. Mason. Let me see your hands. There is nothing wrong with my hands. They are clean. Mr Crosby. Show him your hand. Lady Crosby. If you please. Mr Crosby managed to cover his hand with the lamplight before the seance began. You kept out of the circle, Mason. They were holding hands across your body. Well. I was frightened. Naturally. You said the hands would give you away. - They did that. That's the second time tonight you remained out of the circle. That is true. I thought at the first seance .. Dr. Mason's hand was amazingly soft. Helen sat next to .. I was holding her hand. - Thank you. Mason, you are under arrest. But you can't. There is no proof. There are no fingerprints on the knife. - How do you know that? You stole Miss O'Neill's handkerchief before the seance began tonight. You wrapped the handle of the knife to avoid fingerprints. You stabbed Wales. Threw the knife in the ceiling, left the handkerchief on the floor. And very quietly got back into your own chair again. And you killed Leonard Lee also. Alright. Yes. Yes. I killed him. Then you killed Wales in order to .. - I had to. I had to kill him. He would have found out that I killed Lee. It is ironic. Wales never thought for a moment that you were the murderer. Nell. I lied, Nell. I was afraid Lionel had done it. Oh dear. Oh. Inspector. You are the better man. Maybe so. But you are a grand woman, Mrs O'Neill. It's a funny thing, Inspector. With all your modern inventions and scientific fiddle-faddle. You still find the old-fashioned reasons at the bottom of a murder. Nothing has ever really changed. Love has been just the same since Adam and Eve. And hate since .. Since Cain. Who killed Cain, Inspector? Abel killed Cain. No. I thought Cain killed Abel. ..s-d..
