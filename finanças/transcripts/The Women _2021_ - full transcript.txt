I came back again. You made me jump. What is this thing? -What? -This. A storehouse. -It's so dirty. -It's really dirty. Don't say that. Whose land is this? Whose land? Land? Building? Building? Well, I'm using it now. Does it belong to a relative? I don't have any relatives. Only my little sister. Where does she live? It's a secret. A secret? You were singing, weren't you? I heard you. -I wasn't singing. -You were! I heard you. I can't say that I'm not sad Your dad listened to that a lot. Those days were the happiest time of my life. Why do you keep bees? Huh? Who knows? What about you? Don't you have any dreams? Dreams? I gave them up ages ago. Well... Can you look after the bees when I can't get here? Why did you say that? Just felt like it. THE WOMEN Morning. Once again today, the show will focus on news about COVID-19. As the virus spreads like wildfire around the world, a supplementary budget was approved on April 30th. A handout of 100,000 yen per resident was confirmed. Good morning! Good morning! How's it going? Well... Naoki, can you remake breakfast for me? The cloth masks have been labeled ''Abenomasks''. Sure. Your mail. Thank you. These cloth masks can be washed and reused. Finished? Thank you very much. No problem. I'll get your towel. Thank you. There we go. Yes? How's my mom? She ate it all after I took out the carrots. Sorry. What for? Don't apologize. Misaki... Can I see you later? We don't usually meet at night. Well... We didn't finish, did we? See you later. Have a nice day. Are you finished? No, not yet. Let me help you. What about the childcare center? It's OK. Thanks. -Here. -Got it. Kaori. Can I talk about something serious? What is it? Well, you know... Since you left... I've been lying the whole time. When my dad overdosed and committed suicide, I said some terrible things. But... I've been blaming my mom. I'm lying to myself, and I'm lying to others too. It's a mess. Maybe I'm going crazy. You're all right. Really? Well, you're all right too, then. Right? You're all right. Thanks. We're all right. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, can you... do the window? All right. That's done. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. Are you settling in OK? Yes. Jun has a bit of a fever, so he's not coming in today. Oh, really? Yes. You two, please put masks on. Already? Some parents have complained. We'll do it when they come. Do it now. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Throw that away. Why? How come no one uses them? Why would they? You can wash and reuse it. If you say so. Here. What's this? Money for your new business. I can't accept this. Why not? Just take it. No, it wouldn't be right. I want to support your dream. For real? For real. No way. It's really all right. I want to be together! Seriously? Really? We can do it. I'm off. Misaki. Thanks. See you. Misaki! Toilet. Wait. Did you disinfect your hands properly? Yes. Some COVID-19 patients do not develop symptoms. Today, we will explain about asymptomatic infections. You're doing it on purpose, aren't you? What? Putting the salt where I can't reach it. I didn't do it on purpose. Good morning. I'm Maryam Tanaka, a home helper from Happiness Care. But our helper is always Naoki Kumagai. Mr. Kumagai transferred. Excuse me. Good morning. Who are you? I'm Maryam Tanaka, your home helper. Where's Naoki? He transferred. I understand that, but no one told me anything. Hey, Misaki! Could you check that for me? What's going on, Misaki? ''Pick up the phone.'' Could you tell me where Naoki transferred to? What are they thinking sending that foreigner? Where the hell is she even from? Did you really not know about this? I kept telling them, but they wouldn't accept it. Yes. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Please don't tell anyone I told you. OK. I've written my number. Please call me if you need to. All right. Take care. Hello? Hi, Misaki. It's raining over here. Shall we drink inside today? I'm not sure if I can meet today. How about after you're done at home? Actually, I'm not feeling too good. I see. Sorry. Let's meet some other time. This is so messy. How do they get so dirty? Don't you normally get new ones? I'd think so. Not that I'm not grateful. Right. They'd get dirty anyway. They're so small, aren't they? Is this for winter? Maybe. It looks warm. Oh, this is cute! It looks good. It's nice, isn't it? Be careful. -Look. -It's tiny. All right. Wait a minute. Huh? What's up? It's the police. Yes? This is the police. We received a report that a burglar was seen entering your house. Could I check inside? I'll let you in. Thank you. Hello. My name is Ueshima. Do you mind if I check around the rear entrance? -Go ahead. -Come in. Excuse me. -Just now? -A little earlier. -Is it just the two of you? -Yes. But we've been here all day. I see. Did you hear any noises? No, I didn't. -Did you hear anything? -Nothing. What are you doing? I'm Naoki's fiancée. Huh? No, no, no... Fiancée? No, she isn't! What are you saying? We're engaged! We'll listen to your side. Let's go outside first. Wait... Listen... I'm engaged to him. We understand. Let's go outside. Please hold on a minute. We planned to get married after he starts his business. I gave him money. I have messages and photos on my phone. Hold on. ''Kaori: Sorry. You have your own life. I'm battling like a bee...'' Let's talk at the station. Listen to me! He said we were going to get married! Please calm down. Listen to me. He said it. I understand. What is this? -What's happening? -What's going on? I'm asking you. I have no idea who she is. Really? I don't know her! Hello. It's Maryam. Yes. Misaki hasn't come home yet. Should I keep on looking after her mother? All right. I'll do that. OK. Bye. The other party isn't going to file a complaint. Hello, is that Maryam? This is Misaki. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Yes, I'm on my way home. Bye. Huh? What's going on? Hold on. Please stop the car. Sorry. Excuse me. This area is off-limits. My friend is here. You still can't come in here. -Excuse me. -Stop it. -Hey, let go of me. -Listen... Excuse me. It's off-limits. Hold on. Wait a minute. It's off-limits. Let go! Hey, you! Stop right there. Stop. Hey, stop. ''Prescription'' You left me alone with that foreign woman until now. What if she stole something? What's up? Kaori died. Huh? Why? You must be jinxed. Naoki's gone too. Everyone's unhappy because of you. ''Kaori Sato unsent a message'' -Good morning. -Good morning. Sorry it's so early. It's all right. I'm sorry about the other day. Don't worry about it. She'll tell you to add more seasoning, but please keep it light. All right. No alcohol or cigarettes. She'll end up collapsing again. I understand. She can be a pain, but thank you for coming. It's all right. My pleasure. Excuse me... Hello. What are you doing? I'm putting the honeycomb into an extractor to... No, I mean... Who are you? Oh, sorry, I'm Rin Sato. Kaori's sister? Yes. Oh, are you Misaki? Yes. We met each other a lot when you were a baby. My sister told me all about you. What about the funeral? The funeral? I was her only family. I'm afraid I held the funeral on my own. I see. Please wait a minute. Hey... Can I help? Huh? I don't have a driver's license, so I wasn't sure how to deliver them. I don't know this area well either. But why did you offer to help me? You must be busy with other work and stuff. I made a promise. At least break the fish into smaller bits before you serve it. What's that foreigner called? Maryam? Even she can do that. You really are no good. ''Prescription'' Kaori? What's wrong? I don't know. Are you eating properly? If you don't talk to me, I can't help you. Please talk to me. ''Misaki, congratulations on your 9th birthday'' ''Kaori Sato, Class 2, 1st Grade'' ''Happy Birthday, Misaki From Naoki'' Kaori. He wanted to meet you. Sorry for the intrusion. I'm Naoki Kumagai. Kaori Sato. Is it OK if he joins us? Sorry. I'll help. I'll do it. When did you two meet? We went to the same elementary school and childcare center, but Kaori moved away. Then she came back as an adult to do beekeeping. Wow, beekeeping. That's amazing. It is, isn't it? I'll do it. I'm sorry! I'll do it. No! Kaori? Huh? Kaori? Are you OK? Your husband had a kind smile. He was too kind. Hold on a minute. Here we go. It's hot today, isn't it? It's been really hot and humid. All right. Are you OK? Yes. I'll take your walking stick. -It's so hot. -Yeah. I'll put your tea here. Thank you. Excuse me. Why don't you take off your mask? You must be hot. It's a rule. You don't have coronavirus. Just take it off. You'll end up with heat stroke. All right. Thank you. The last time I spoke to my sister on the phone, I was in the middle of an argument with my boyfriend. He never sticks with a job for long. I don't think we can stay together any longer. Are you going to end it? What do you think I should do? I guess... My sister was always reluctant to talk about this kind of thing. She didn't like it? I wasn't able to talk about relationships either. Good morning. Good morning. Nice to meet you. This is Mariko. I'm Mariko. I'm Misaki. It's nice to meet you. She was on maternity leave. In the end, we asked her to come back again. I look forward to working with you. Shall we clean up, then? All right. It's so reassuring to have a veteran like Mariko around. It's a huge help. Thank you so much. -Misaki. -Yes? Can I have a moment? To be frank with you, this is the manager's idea... Mariko has come back to work, and you have to look after your mom. It was supposed to be a temporary position. I'm really sorry. It was decided that perhaps you should leave. -But... -Sorry... I protested that we need you, but apparently we're barely scraping by. I see. -I'm so sorry. -It's all right. I was actually thinking of starting beekeeping fulltime, so this is good timing. Oh, really? That's great. It was short, but thank you. No, thank you. Oh... I'll visit your apiary sometime. Sure. Miss Amamiya, the kids are going home. Miss Amamiya? It's home time. Sorry. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. See you again. Thanks. Wait a minute. Misaki Amamiya? I knew it. Don't you remember me? It's Yasui from your class in junior high. This takes me back. Did you get married? Are you married? Oh, really? You're single? I see. Hey, Jun, come here. This is my son, Jun. Remember Noriko Ueda? We had a shotgun wedding. What a surprise. It's been so long. Let's go for a drink. Do you know that place, Torihachi? Get away! There's a bee. What is it? A bee? Hey, what are you doing? -Are you OK, Jun? -What's up? Miss Amamiya pushed Jun over. Jun? -Is he OK? -Seems like he hurt his finger. I'm very sorry about this. I'm so sorry. Where's Jun? His father's taken him to the examination room. It's been a while. Why did you push my child? Well, a honeybee flew into the room, and to stop Jun from spraying it, I pushed him over without thinking. Honeybees aren't pests. Huh? Honeybees aren't pests. What are you talking about? You're supposed to protect the children, aren't you? Yes. -Thank you. -Take care. -Are you OK? -Yeah, I'm fine. -It's just a jammed finger. Don't worry. -Oh, that's good. It isn't good. Sorry. I didn't mean that. Let's not argue here. What? What do you mean? Why? Well, let's drop it, all right? Shall we go home? Thank you. Excuse me. -Excuse me. -I'm so sorry about this. I'm so sorry. Do you know them? We went to the same junior high. The amount of work gradually decreased. Then, on about April 3rd, there wasn't any more work, so from the next week... Isn't today... I have something I'd like to give to your mother. Is it OK if I come in? Sure. Thank you. Please try it. It looks delicious. But this is... Your mother said that she doesn't like carrots, so I made a Persian carrot stew called khoresh havij. I hope you like it. Maryam, you're wearing a mask again. You can take it off when you come here. It's a rule, though. You must be hot. Take it off. You don't need to worry about the rules. Well... Go ahead. Thank you. Oh, it's lovely! Really? It's delicious. That's great. Oh... I heard that the apiary is moving. Who told you that? Another customer. It hasn't been decided yet. Really? So you'll keep making honey there? I don't know yet. Did you know Kaori? I bought her honey sometimes. Kaori... she was a good girl. Yes... I was saved by Kaori's honey at a difficult time. When I eat that honey, I feel so happy. It would be really sad if the apiary moved. ''Staff wanted'' Excuse me... Hey... I want to get a basket. You're in the way. Sorry. What? What is it? What? He just laughed. No, I didn't. You did. That'll be 251 yen. Hello. Hello. -Excuse me. My name is Maryam. -It's nice to meet you. Why have you been coming home so early recently? What about the childcare center? They asked me to not go in. So you can't work? Good grief. Have you seen Naoki? I bet you broke up again. I sent you to university, but you can't work as a teacher. You got a job in a childcare center, but you can't stick to it. You can't find a husband. You can't have children. You've just been relying on your mother. I have no idea how you ended up like this. Do you know how much money I've spent on you? I've had enough. You're just like your father. I wish I never gave birth to you. Maryam is better at cooking. This is disgusting. You can't even cook. Ow! Shut up! Can't you even wash the dishes? Damn it! That's so cute. What is it for? I came up with this when I saw my sister drawing a picture of a bee. I'm making a picture card show. What for? I'm thinking of asking if I can show it at the childcare center. That sounds great. I'd like to help. -Would you? -Yeah. -Thank you. -Do you mind? Of course not. Hold on a minute. You can keep on doing that if you like. Hello again. Who was it? Hello. Excuse me... It's nice to meet you. I'm Maryam Tanaka. Tetsuya Suyama. Tetsuya... Good morning, Misaki. Mitsuko. -Good morning. -Good morning. Here's your mail. ''Misaki Amamiya, die.'' What's this? Do you have any idea who sent it? Probably Noriko Yasui. Again? Why? Her son goes to the childcare center. I accidentally hurt him. I think it's her revenge. What the hell!? You're an adult. Sort it out yourself. Stop hurting me. Don't drag me into it. Let's call the... Maryam, can I talk to you? Yes... You don't need to come here anymore. I'll look after my mother now. Misaki, what brought this on? I'll cancel with the company, so you can go home for today. The state of emergency was in April and May, but it's summer now. People are at risk of dying from heat stroke. The government began sending out masks last month. But there are reports that some masks were moldy and contained bugs. This is just one example of the government's slipshod handling. I'm worried about whether Japan can cope with the second and third waves. My family has 50,000 members. Most of them are girls. I wake up early in the morning to get pollen from the flowers. I receive pollen from many flowers, including ones on vegetable plants. This helps lots of food to grow. I can explain. What's going on? Everyone's food is... We're outdoors and practicing social distancing. Hello. We're just doing a picture card show about honeybees. About honeybees? My Jun was injured by Miss Amamiya because of a bee. You're right. I'm sorry. That's why you harassed her? What do you mean? Didn't you write it? The letter harassing Misaki. No, I didn't. You wrote ''Misaki Amamiya, die.'' I didn't do that. Misaki! Misaki! Misaki! Misaki! ''Misaki Amamiya, you're garbage.'' What were you doing? Come quickly when I call you. You can walk on your own, can't you? I'm... sick to the back teeth of looking after you! Huh? You're always looking down on me. You blame me for everything. My life is like this because of you! Kill me, then! Kill me, like you did your father! Why? It was you! I said that to him instead of you because you told me to say it. Don't blame me. This whole time... you've been... regretting it... haven't you? I... reg... regret it too. No... Don't. Mitsuko! Mitsuko! Are you OK? Mitsuko... What happened? Where's Misaki? I wanted... Misaki to be happy. But... after her father committed suicide... she was bullied by everyone. Maybe I raised her wrong. Well, you're all right too, then. Right? You're all right. Thanks. We're all right. You needed... to tell those lies. Right? Thanks. -It's all right. -Thanks. Kaori is dead. Why did she die? Hello? Rin? Rin? Did you get my message? Don't say that. Well, it doesn't matter. Huh? It doesn't matter. Listen, Rin. When are you coming? Don't say that. Just come. I... Listen, Rin. I... I've been battling through life. Battling every day. I've lived like a honeybee. I wanted... to tell you that. Listen, Rin. Take care of your health, and battle... Take care of your health. I can't say that I'm not sad But now a quiet happiness subtly passes Through our clasped fingers Mitsuko... Look... This is honey that Misaki made. Try some. Her honey is delicious, isn't it? Misaki... Welcome home. Hello. Misaki... Your honey... It's lovely. Thank you... for everything. What have I done? It's really nice. Thank you. Rin, why don't you come in? Come on in. Excuse me. I'm hungry. Right? Well then, let's make dinner. Come on, Rin. What are you doing there? Thank you. I didn't know. I didn't know. We don't know anything. Right. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you.
