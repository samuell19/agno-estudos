The day that I met her was very sudden. Holy crap! My breath...and my heartbeat.... I could watch him kiss 100 times over! Let's see it again! Look! Look! You're as diligent as ever! Ruu-chan! You don't have an interest in Ayase Kaede? Who was that again? I can't believe you! He's a former member of the idol group Funny Bone. And he's become a big success as an actor since his departure 2 years ago! He's number one for commercial features! And he's been ranked the number one celebrity you want as a boyfriend for 3 consecutive years! He's a super star that you'll see everyday without fail! Are you listening? Hinana doesn't have an interest in Prince-like celebrities. That's right! Aachan is right! You're such a diligent character! You're wasting your life! Everyday for me... Is very systematic. I get up at 5. At 5:10 I water the plants. Then I do my radio exercises. Hinana! We're going now! We'll leave it to you! Yes! See you later! We're off! And at 6 I make breakfast on behalf of my parents who are busy with their restaurant. Banzai! At 6:30 I help my little sister Suzu change her clothes. Here! Then I leave at 7. Hurry up! Okay! Ready? Clap! Okay! Thanks for waiting! Thanks for waiting! I come to get Suzu at 18:00. Welcome home! I'm home! Then we come home at 18:30. I'm home! Okay! We're home! The shoe fit her feet perfectly. Cinderella was kneeling in front of the Prince. I've finally found you. Please marry me! My mundane days keep on repeating. But... It's a Prince! I can't tell anyone. I really want to fall in love with a Prince-like person. An extra? Yeah! It seems like Ayase Kaede is filming a movie.... The next film location is our school! And so they need a certain amount of high school extras... And our school was picked for it! But it might be difficult for you huh? You have your studies.... I'll do it! You're doing it!? I can't reject a job offer. The Ayase Kaede is going to be right here! You two in the front! Please come! You're going to be at this table. And you're going to be over here. Sorry! A real-life Prince? Man, that was something else! I can't believe someone like that exists in our world! It's crazy! Y-You think so? I didn't really see him. Let's try to during our next shoot! 87. 85. 86. No way! Ayase Kaede? I can't get enough of high school girl's asses! I heard him wrong! Yeah, that's right.... Ouch... 86! That was a weird dream.... Wait, that wasn't a dream! That was a different person... That's right! Who was a different person? No, i-it's nothing! More importantly...can I go out today Mom? I'll be back by the evening. You don't have to ask me that. See you later. Thanks! I wonder if I came too early today... Aren't you glad to be here? Yeah! Is that... Just like I thought... It was the one that Suzu wanted. Alright! This is my last chance! Please! From here? Or over here? More to the right. Just do it! Okay! The right! Yep. Alright! Right there! Okay! I did it! Thank you! We meet again number 86. Ayase-san!? No way! Is that Kaede? No way! Ayase-san! Use this to hide your face! What should we do? Let's go! We should be okay now. U-Umm.... Sorry! Why were you there? I have some filming later on today so I wanted to get a figure. This form is the best! The volume, curves, and softness! Everything is perfect! You have quite a unique hobby huh? I'm sorry! I'm going to go see a movie right now! Pardon me! Are you okay? I'm okay! I'm okay! I won't say anything about your butt fetish! My butt fetish? Please don't worry! Such a weird girl. What should I do? I can't wash this hand anymore.... How nice. This is a great place! Why? You like romance films? N-N-No way! It's just a coincidence! A coincidence! I have an interest in any kind of story. It's starting! Is meeting you another big miracle? This is fate. I like them after all! Romance films! I'm sorry! I lied earlier. I...haven't been in love before. I really admire it! I want to fall in love like a fairy tale... I-I know! That it's impossible.... But... An earnest person shouldn't lie. What's wrong? Take it off. Ah, take off your shoes. Excuse me? Just do it. Use these. They're a little big but it's better than broken ones. No, but then what about you? My car is close by. But like, it's my fault anyways. Later! I'm going home. I think you should be able to have a good romance. Even if you get a job, don't let your guard down because you're only second years. Consult with your parents. And submit it later this week. Okay.... What should I do with these? You're going to the national university huh? You don't want to do anything else but study? I don't! What about piano? Is it okay for you not to play the piano anymore? Even if I put money into it, I won't become a pro. Studying won't betray me. At least be like a normal high school girl and fall in love once or twice. Right? Yeah... Love will just interfere with my studies. He's different now isn't he? No way! Why? What's going on? Who knows... Found you! I just came to drop something off. Don't make a ruckus. Give me your feet. Huh? That was just like a fairy tale huh? A Prince is right in front of me! Something unbelievable happened.... Please wait! Thanks for the shoes! You didn't have to come all this way. I'm sorry! I just wanted to freshen them up a little bit! I don't mean that they stink! Tell me your name next time. This number can't be reached right now. What did you want? You heard about the next job right? The one where you're going to play my lover? I don't suit you? I respect you as an actress. It's reassuring. I feel relieved when I hear that. Best regards! I need to wash it off! He was just messing with me! I called the right number though! Does something seem sketchy about her? No way! Did something happen with Ayase Kaede? There's no way! Right? He is a superstar after all. Good morning! Good morning! Ayase is here! Good morning! They sure scream for you huh? Geez! I'd just get pure silence! That's true. Yep! I'm suffocating! You have a lot of stalkers. You need to watch out. Okay, okay. Okay, Okay? Are you even listening? It's a fact that you are lacking in some aspects as an actor. Being popular and real is the same. In order to not become irrelevant you need to do this. I'm going to go out real quick. Did you even hear me? I'll be back soon! Huh? Did you just become 85 centimeters? Ayase-san? I'm indeed Ayase-san. I was waiting for your phone call! I called you over and over! But it kept on sending me to your voicemail. I have proof! That's my old number. Sorry! Sorry! I'll give you the right one! That's enough! Please stop teasing me! From that time... I was interested in you. But I've stopped expecting things now. Pardon me! It's okay to have expectations. What did you just do? I remember everything from the other day. I've always wanted to know your name. What is your name? Hanazawa Hinana. Hanazawa Hinana-san. Can you go on a date with me next time? Am I in elementary school? Am I a baby? These are my Dad's! Wait...why am I choosing? I just want to wear some good panties! Aachan is here! I just came from the store.... I didn't see it! I didn't see anything okay? Thanks for waiting Hinana. T-thanks for coming out of your way to.... Hinana? You just said my first name.... Alright! Get on! P-Pardon me! Umm...where are we going today? My room. It's huge! It's way too huge! I'm going to get something to drink so sit back and relax. Sit back and relax? You sure like plays huh? You don't have to worry about anyone seeing us here. And you can do anything you want. A-anything? You just imagined something sexual. W-w-what are you saying? This is a nice picture. It...it looks like you're having a lot of fun! Right? What do you normally do? I study! What are your hobbies? Studying! S-sorry! I don't really do anything... Thanks for the food. You do! Let's go see a movie! Any movie that you want. Pick anything you want! Is that okay? N-No way! This is awkward.... Ayase-san.... My heart isn't ready yet... Oh.... Why did you invite me? I tricked you. You have nice eyelashes. What are you doing? Oh, it's you Shige-chan. You're early! Shige-chan? He's my manager. He sometimes comes over when I get lonely. Who are you? But get away from each other! I'll introduce you. This is my girlfriend. Girlfriend? Is that no good? Then it's decided! How old are you? 16 years old... What the hell are you thinking? She's in high school! A 16 year old high school girl! That's unbelievable man! This is a scandal! For crying out loud! How were you going to take responsibility for this? You'll be finished and lose your popularity alongside everything else! This is the most crucial time for your dramas and movies too... I understand. If you understand then why are you doing this? She's like an air purifier. What? Don't interfere okay? Oh crap! Kaede is in new movie! It's a love story! I'm envious of the girl playing his girlfriend! Girlfriend? This isn't a dream right? You have a new message from Ayase-san Sorry Hinana. I'll be filming the new movie so I won't be able to see you for a while. Her anxiety has to be because of a boy! A boy? If you keep on sitting back then she'll get stolen from you! It has nothing to do with me! That hurt! What are you doing? The pain of a broken heart hurts even more! Sorry for having you help me! More importantly...is Auntie okay? She just has a stiff waist. She'll get better over time. Is that right? I'm glad! I'll take those flowers. Thanks! Akira-kun and Hinana-chan... You guys look like a young couple. That's not true! Ah, but Aachan's future wife will be happy! In that case, it would be good if you got married to me. That suprised me! It's rare for you to make jokes like that. Hello, this is Lucy gray. To the film shoot? Right now? Pardon me! She brought the flowers for us! Okay! Hello! Thank you! Ready....start! Is this really the end? Hey, say something! Cut! Okay! Good work! Why? People are going to come so let's talk over there. I'm sorry! I wasn't planning on watching... I was helping out my childhood friend at the flower shop... And I came to deliver some flowers. No, the same goes for me. You probably saw something unwanted. No, no! It was so beautiful.... And I was really moved... Your acting was super super wonderful! It made my heart beat right out of my chest! Then why did you run away? Well... I would feel bad if I interfered with your work. What the? Is that it? But... It would be nice if you were my first. This is my workplace. No, not right now.... The kiss reservation is completed. So other men won't touch you. Today? Yep! I suddenly got a day off. Let's go on a date! Hinana? Did something happen? Sorry! I have plans today... You have plans? Yes, my family isn't back from my Grandma's house. I'm going to have my childhood friend's birthday party at my house. That flower shop one? Yes! Their name is Aachan. We celebrate each other's birthday every year. They're a precious friend! I wish I could reschedule it but.... Listen up! I'm going to have a stomachache and fade out halfway through. I'll leave you and Hinana alone! Hanabe Akira! Today is the day you become a man! Go ahead. Pardon the intrusion! Good afternoon! Yep... H-h-hold on! What's the meaning of this? Happy birthday Aachan! That's not right Ayase-san! Aachan isn't her... I'm right here~ A boy? Kaede-sama was Hinana's boyfriend? I'm supporting your guy's love with all of my heart! You traitor. Thanks! Have you three always been close? Yes! Since elementary school! But Hinana and Aachan have known each other for longer. Well...since we were little kids. You still have some left! Eat all of it! Shut up! Despite the way he looks now, he used to be a weak crybaby! Right? You used to drink a ton of milk because you were frustrated with your growth! Who had the upset tummy all the time? Hey! Don't say unnecessary stuff! You wet your bed for the longest time! Hey you! They're always like this. The food is ready! I'll help out! Are you serious? About Hinana. Why did a person like you choose her? She's never been in a romance or anything. She's naive! If you're not serious... Then please don't get close to her. Wait...you like Hinana? I'm sorry but... I don't want to hear that from someone who hasn't made a move. What about you? You don't know anything about Hinana! This is a long-term battle! Anyways, I'm not giving up! Happy birthday Aachan! Are you okay? If we get spotted then.... You're a precious friend right? In that case I can make a good excuse. Ayase-san... But more importantly..is it okay if you're not there? At your Grandma's house. I umm.... I'm busy with my studies! But I make sure to give you time since you are even more busy! In that case, I want to see you alone next time. But like...you were super friendly with a boy like that? Even if I have someone like you as my partner? Are you.... There's no way! I can't afford to lose you. It's open! Okay! Pardon the intrusion! Welcome! You're actually pretty wild! N-No way! Hurry up and put on some clothes! You'll catch a cold! In that case... How's that? It seems like a lover thing to do. The movie that Aki made has a piano composition in it. I'm practicing it but it's pretty difficult. It's okay! The things you couldn't do yesterday, you'll be able to do today. If you practice the piano then you can become good at it. Furthermore, no matter what key you press you'll always hear a nice clean sound. I'm looking forward to what kind of tones you play. Did you play piano before? I used to back in the day. But piano takes a lot of money... I couldn't become a pro and I didn't want to burden my parents... I'm the oldest child. But, I get along with my parents now. You don't have any regrets? Nope! There you go! It's dry! Thanks! Here! If you get lonely then come over whenever. Thank you! Thanks for waiting Suzu! You're late Oneechan! Sorry about that! It seems like you've been having fun recently. Did you get a boyfriend? N-No way! Come on! Let's go Suzu! It's fine! It's fine! Thanks! Alright, do your best at the store! Thanks! Be careful on your way home! I wonder if she can't talk about it? Practice makes perfect! Whenever I want? When is that? Let's go somewhere! No, I'm going to be pretty busy. With your practice? Hinana! Is something wrong? No! Not really! Did you see that drama yesterday? I saw it! I saw it! It was so good! It was something else! Shu was great in it! But like, it seems like they used to date each other! They're definitely going to get back together! They're both studs after all! Oh crap! For real? You knew? I've been following Kaede-san for 5 years now! You didn't know so I didn't tell you. They dated 2 years ago. But they were both so busy with work that they broke up it seems. Aren't me and Uchida Shu-san totally different? I don't have any chance against her do I? You don't! Run-chan! It's Ayase Kaede! His former girlfriend has no competition! You need to stop thinking about that! But you know what? What does it feel like to kiss your ex? I see...I see. You haven't kissed yet? Can I be called a girlfriend? You can't! Uchida Shu definitely has the upper hand! Run-chan.. It's a joke! The thing that you are lacking is sexiness! Sexiness! Rouge that makes men go crazy. I can't see anything around my eyes. I can only feel it. It feels like I'm about to burst my heart. That's good! Here I go! Taking it! Take it! Take it! Alright say cheese! I want to steal those lips. We're definitely going to make it a success! Kissing you! Why didn't you consult with us? Hey... Did you think you were doing it for him? I ended up coming.... Rouge that will make men go crazy... Alright! Who is that? It seems like they got the wrong address. Huh? Is he not home? At times like these.... It's your turn Mr. Key! What did you want to talk about? Pardon me. Hinana? Hold on! Hinana! Hold on! Of course it's like that! Shu-san is 100 times more pretty than me. She's sexy too! And she's an adult... Of course you'll be attracted to her. Hinana... Why me? I have no love experience and I eat a lot! I'm totally plain... I don't understand you. We live in two different worlds! Can you go home? It's like a drama scene. It's real bad. What's so good about that high school girl? You've always regretted it! During your lowest time in Funny Bone... And the project that you chose. At that time I didn't have the confidence to support you. But no matter how much I focus on my work... I could never get you out of my head. But I realized it when we spent time together this summer. Even now.... I still like you Kaede-kun! Hey! Can we start over again? I'll be able to understand you better than anyone! Thanks for coming! No problem! How's Hinana? It seems like she still doesn't have an appetite. She's holed up in her room. No matter how many times I ask her, she never tells me she's okay. Tell them I'm not home right now. I'm not here! What happened? Everyone's worried about you. You always look depressed at school too. Something happened right? With Ayase-san. Just give up! On that guy. It looks like you're suffering a lot. If it was me...I would never make you feel that way! Aachan... I've always liked you! I know that you don't have any feelings for me. But... I don't want to see you suffering! I want you to smile! I'm sorry for being so sudden. I had to. For crying out loud.... What am I doing? Aachan... Likes me? Sorry! Sorry! It's going to be Fall soon huh? Yes! The beautiful tan Fall sky! Did you know that this place is where men and women spend time with each other? No! I want to start over again with Kaede-kun. That's why I don't want you to see him anymore. I wanted you to make that promise with me today. Did you hear me? You sure are beautiful after all! I can't believe that you're from this earth! Your face looks just like a doll! You're in a totally different realm than a plain little girl like me! Plain little girl? I've been thinking about things since then! And how I could win against you. But I coudn't think of a single thing! I have never been kissed. And I even bought Rouge that makes men go crazy! It was useless! But... This is the first time for me. Experiencing these feelings. I'm just happy that I'm acknowledged! Ayase-san's smiling face... And even his troubled face! And even his slightly tense face. I want to see them all! He might just be doing this on a whim but... I like Ayase-san after all! I like him to the point where I can't get him out of my head! You're such a fool! You're a real dummy! Of course we're not getting back together again! Kaede-kun rejected me. And so I wanted to bully you a little bit. I thought that it would be over for you. What's up with you? You're such a fool that it went over your head. You're naive! Furthermore... You're not going to leave him even after a kiss? Aachan... I've never realized your feelings at all. I'm really sorry! Hinana... It made me happy. To hear you say that you like me. It made me super happy! But... The person who I like is... Ayase-san! I'm sorry if saying this will hurt you. But... I don't want to lie to you when you told me your serious feelings! That's just like you! Don't make that kind of face. Thanks. Oneechan! The Prince has come! I'm really sorry about the other day! Nothing happened with Shuu! I've been thinking about things. Thinking about what you said. What about me? I can't be normal like you! I can't go outside on dates with you. And I can't hold your hand! But... Since the first time I met you... I couldn't take my eyes off you! When you found out about my hobby you smiled at me and accepted it. When I ate with you... You ate the fish so beautifully! All of that charmed me! Everytime I met you, I started to fall for you more and more! The person who I like... Is you Hinana! I want to be by your side! Ayase-san... That's pretty lame huh? The same goes for me! I'm sorry! I didn't listen to you. And I just ran away. I like you too. I want to be by your side. Is he okay coming to my house? We're closed today. We look forward to seeing you again soon. Closed Closed No way! Welcome Hinana! Umm... What in the world is going on? I rented it out. Just for today! We weren't able to have a normal date last summer break right? Just for today! Let's have some fun today! Yes! Alright! Let's go! Ayase-san? Actually...this is my first time on a roller-coaster at a park... Are you okay Ayase-san? I'm okay! You had something you weren't good with huh? No, no, no! It was just my first time! Then do you want to ride it again? No! I'm okay! You were looking at the horse's butts weren't you? It's a bad habit! Want to ride it again? It's yummy! Hey... Let's go! One more time! What am I doing? Sorry, can you take care of Suzu? I have to go back to the store. Mom Hinana! What's wrong? Sorry! I have to go back home soon. Is that right? Today was like a dream! Being alone with you in a place like this... Me too! I'm glad I had my first experience with you Hinana. F-First experience? No way! Umm.... Can you listen to one of my selfish requests? What? I want you to hold my hand! We're already doing that! No, that's not what I meant. I meant like when you make a prayer! You meant that? I admire it! When lovers hold hands, it's different than male and female companions... It's more like a real lover type of... You know what? It's fine for you to be a little more selfish. No, no! If I do anymore than I won't be able to go home... My heart isn't ready... You still want to do it right? Piano. When you quit the things you want to do... It's painful isn't it? Whatever you choose to do... I will support you all the way. Ayase-san... Hey... Close your eyes. Just do it. You can open them. This is... I'm your boyfriend after all. You're going a birthday date this Sunday? And your partner is that person! You're going to become an adult! Hey, knock it off Run-chan! Here you go! It's a little early but it's a present! It's to make your skin nice and beautiful for the men! I'm going to sleep at 8 today! Yes? What is it? Where are you? I'm going to get you right now so get ready! Ayase-san. Morning! Morning! That's all for the weather today. Next, we have a big scoop! The popular Ayase Kaede-san has been spotted with a girl. No way... It seems like his new girlfriend is a high school girl and so in order to not be spotted.... New girlfriend is a high school girl!? 24 year old Kaede Ayase's He did that with a high school girl? She's the same age as you huh? Hinana? He's here! How do you know her? Tell us about the girl! Is she a high school girl? They say that your partner is a high school girl. Is that true? Hey! Turn on the TV! Hurry up! What the hell? For real? What's that guy doing? Betrayed by Kaede His partner is a high school girl What am I going to do? It's my fault... Hinana! Hinana! Are you okay? It's my fault that Ayase-san... Don't look at it anymore! What am I going to do? I said don't look at it! I need to apologize! What are you saying? I mean, it's my fault! On that day, I went to his apartment.... Hinana! Stop right there! Let go! Let go of me! Hinana! Calm down! Calm down! Look at your mother's eyes! If you go there, then there's no going back. Isn't that right? What should I do? I didn't want this to happen. It shouldn't have happened! There's a ton of lies online! Ayase-san... Has treasured me! He hasn't done anything bad to me! Hinana... I just wanted to be with the person I love. Why? That's right... It's frustrating isn't it? Your mother understands. I understand okay? This is the same high school. Die. Disappear. I'm sorry for causing trouble for you Shige-chan.... Here! This is for the media. To everyone involved in the media. Ayase Kaede's love scandal. Kaede Ayase was reported to have an affair but there is no romance between the girl. They are just close friends. You can't reveal the truth to them. You can't rely on your own strength for this. If the truth gets out then you will have betrayed everyone who has supported you. I knew about all of that. But... I couldn't stop myself. I couldn't even believe myself! This is the first time! For me to have these feelings. Just being next to her.... Makes me feel super happy! No matter how tired I am... If I can see her for even a second... I want to be by her side! She's precious to me! I just didn't want to hurt her... Hello? You knew what would happen if you dated him right? I'm really sorry! Because of me... No, umm.... You're not the only one responsible for it. All it needed was one little slip up. I know that your heart is in the right place. But... Can you not see Kaede anymore? He has to be successful as an actor otherwise it will all be for nothing. What do you mean? You know that he used to be in a group called Funny Bone right? Yes! There were a lot of rumors saying that he was betraying the group in order to become an actor. But that wasn't the case. He quit the group because he couldn't sing anymore. 2 years ago.... It was Funny Bone's dream to play a nationwide tour. Don't rush me, take my heart. Jirasanaide take my heart 2 years ago. I know that you want it. I feel a rush throughout my entire body. Karada juu ni hashiru rush From baby just one kiss Kissing you! Just that alone makes my world spin around. Sore dake de boku no sekai ga mawaru. Wishing you! Kaede had really bad inflammation in his throat. And he hid the pain. But the other five were always watching him. And he finally couldn't hide it anymore. No way! Since forever? Name: Kaede Ayase. Due to the inflammation he will need surgery. And because he hid the pain... It got worse and worse. Because of that... Why did you stay quiet about this for so long? There's no way I could say it! I wanted to live up to everyone's expectations. There's no way we could quit the Nationwide tour because of me. Stop screwing with me! There's no point if you can't sing anymore! Why didn't you consult with me? Why do you think I'm here!? Sorry. I won't see you guys anymore. After that.... He found a new dream of being an actor. And he gained a new goal. He wished the best for his teammates with all of his heart. If it's him... Then I'm going to support his dream. Screening Kakiri Joei today. Ayase-san... I'm sorry. That it came to this. It's my fault after all! That's not right! It's all due to my carelessness. In the end... I've only hurt you a lot. If it's about me then I'm okay. I've already gotten used to all the craziness. The day after I met you... Everyday for me... Was filled with shocking new experiences. You suddenly appeared at my school. And a lot of strange things happened. I stopped doing things at my own pace. And I started moving forward earnestly! My heart has been pounding nonstop. It's way better than any movie I've ever seen. My first love was you Ayase-san. I'm glad it was you. Let's...end this fairy tale already. Thanks for everything that you've done for me. I'm so pathetic that I can't even cry. It was her birthday today.... But I couldn't see Happy birthday... There's no helping it. Let's go home. Go home! Knock it off! Go home! Go home! For real? I can't believe it... Me neither.... This is bad! Kaede said he's going to hold a press conference now! A press conference? I heard it's a press conference... This is bad! Is he going to apologize? I'm deeply sorry for causing a great disturbance. I had a relationship with the girl but... It's a fact that I had a one-sided attraction to her. Your partner was a high school girl... You didn't think that it would be a problem? I think that it's something I shouldn't have done. But... I don't think that it will ever happen again. Falling in love with someone this much. But... In the end, I took careless actions without considering my position... And I ended up hurting her and my fans... Everything is due to my selfishness and naivety. I won't see her anymore. From now on, I'm prepared to start over as an actor... And I want to work hard. In the end... Reality that is like a fairy tale doesn't go well huh? Cry. As much as you want. Don't hold it in. I want to see him. I want to see him... I saw the press conference. In a time like this, you're still going to keep things to yourself? Why do you always carry everything on your own shoulders? You need to understand already! When it's painful then say it's painful! Rely more on me! I'm your comrade after all. If you slip up in a spot like this... I won't know. 3 years later Congratulations. Barcelona International Film Festival Thank you. You've done a very good job. Thank you so much. The actor Ayase Kaede won an award in the Barcelona film festival. He's one of the few Japanese actors who have won it. This is another breakthrough for Japanese actors. Don't you have a meeting today? I'm going! Don't be late to your event! Okay, okay! Shige-chan! I have to tell you something important about the party. Thanks for waiting Hinana. No problem! Did you take time off work? I wanted to see you today no matter what. Happy birthday. This is... I have work in the night so let's go together afterwards okay? Thanks Aachan! Thank you for coming to this party today. I have received the award that I was always aiming for... It's a great pleasure! A lot has happened along the way. But right now... I'm glad that I took this path. I can say that proudly. To everyone who has supported me.... Whether it be my staff... My fans... Or my comrades. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much! Sorry! I couldn't get off work. So I can't go. Congratulations Kaede-kun! Thanks for coming Shu! You've become a nice man huh? Wanna get back together with me? I just want a future full of nice asses. That's fine for me. What the hell? Sorry Kaede! I got this. Was meeting you a miracle? It was fate. Excuse me! Excuse me! I'm glad! I'm super glad! You were wonderful! You were so cool! Everyone! Umm...Thanks for coming! Umm...I have a song made from my gratitude. This song is called Wakamono! The path that you walk is a long path! To Ayase Kaede-sama... Forgive me for this sudden letter. We're going to pick up Hinana soon for her 18th birthday. I want her to tell you something very important. Ever since she broke up with you, she's been watching you on TV. She can't escape from you. I mean, you're everywhere Ayase-san. Hinana is always looking at your compositions... You gave her courage. It's frustrating but.... She needs you. It has to be you. And lastly...here is a present for her birthday. Hinana! Why? 3 years ago. When I broke up with you here. I made my decision. Once I become a man who nobody can complain about... I'll definitely come and get you! I've always wanted to see you. I need you after all! Ayase-san... Happy birthday. Will you walk together with me in a new future? Yes!
