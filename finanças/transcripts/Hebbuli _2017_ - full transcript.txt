There are so may stars in the sky Have you ever tried to count it? If you will start counting today then it will take 6000 years to finish counting stars in only our galaxy and there a lot of such galaxies Scientist says that perhaps 2 billons more. So isn't it possible that out of so many galaxies there is one planet out there people like us exist. Just like we are traveling to moon and mars in order to reach them There could be a possibilty They are also trying to reach us in order to spot our existence.

I knew where my father was going. Since childhood we saw face of tapasvi guru ji face more than our parents. from school bag to bather wall he was present everywhere. he wouldn't even go to dentist without taking a auspicious advise from guruji. tapasvi ji presented my dad a box in which there was a favorable god for each and every task. when he was doing share trading he used to show laxmi godess sculpture to the computer screen. and when he was on treadmill there was a hanuman ji sculpture. Internet prayer, auspicious sight, prasad via courier. it was all tapasvi ji's idea. jaggu touch his feet and take his blessings why jagat janani? why you want to do suicide? grab a pen and a paper and write.

Will you marry me? but what happend? just yes or no? yes but.. tomorrow. tomorrow? tomorrow we will get married. Tapasvi ji's prediction is false. I'll prove it. Congratulation. It was sarfaraz's letter. he wrote that marriage happend between two families. Our country, people and religion everything is different. We can not be happy by making our family unhappy. don't try to contact me. sorry. I was in my city, but my didn't let me stay in the house. I joined a news channel. Boss caught a depressed a dog for breaking news. sometimes we used to get news, sometimes create news. Missing. If found contact PK. I found a story, you reach office I will be there soon. come quickly. Excuse me? Why are you distributing these brochures? One of my case is pending with God. Neither he resolved nor be found. its been a mess. don't where he disappeared. Have you seen him somewhere? No. [Religious song playing on a radio]. Why are you wearing this helmet? I learned from taxi, even in heavy traffic it can be spotted from long distance because of flashy yellow color. so? So it will be easy for the God also to spot me in heavy crowd. They say that animals don't suicide. Its a dog named nikku of sweeti singh who lives in ramesh nagar in delhi. it did three suicide attempts in past one month. It tried jumping from the terrace, licking a sleeping pills and jumping on a gas burner. Why did nikku do this? Is nikku suffering from a mental disorder? [dog whining] what happened jaggu? We'll continue talking to famous industrialist Mr ratan atarival after a short break.. you want coffee? someone get gentleman a coffee. oh no What do you think it has depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? What ever it has why would i care? exactly. Why would anyone care? then why are we showing such stupid news on our channel? so what do you want to show? Can you hold it for a sec? Look at this I met a man today who is distributing pamphlets. seaching God. Did he found? No..but.. Seaching God is religion, Finding God is news. When he found the God bring him here i will put him on air. but you know the company policy. No news on religion and no news on god.Finish. What happened to you? where did your fighting spirit go? you want to see fighter? here it is. should I show you the marks on my bum? Its not birth marks. The follower of your dad's dearest friend tapasvi guru did this with trishul weapon. ..when i broadcasted the news against him. That day i decided if i want to stay in this country i should avoid messing up with religion. That's it. boss didn't let me follow up that story. ..but after 2 weeks i found that story once again on the way. Robber! Robber! Somebody catch him, He is stealing money from the donation box. hey where you going? wait! catch him. Get away. fool! you putting hands in God's pocket? pandit ji, he is not a thief. I was putting money in donation box but my purse fell in it. He was just helping me to take it out. its true. you can check it. purse has around 5000 rupees. you can check. pundit ji. that's mine. It was. once donated can't be returned. Let them go. hey but what was you doing exactly? I was taking back my refund. He took the payment but didn't do my job. hang on a sec. I saw first you took out some money and then put it back? In this office department (temple) i only deposited 200 rupees. Rest i put it back. you had lots of holy amulets and talisman in your neck? I rejected. Won't wear no more. then why you have god stickers on you? Self-defense. Just like they put god picture on wall so that nobody urinate on it. I put it here so that nobody hit me. meetu. where are you? Can you pick me up? i don't have money to go home. i am in mudrika opposite the big temple. come quickly thanks bye. here, take this. why? for taxi. I don't feel good when somebody unable to return home. listen.. don't have more. that was it. no no. i cant take this. why? you must need this to get back home yourself. Money can't help me. Why? where do you live? Although i stay in Agrasen's Baoli, However as its raining often now-a-days so i check in sometimes in lock up. Lock up as in police lock up? yeah in delhi they have 122. I keep going in rotation. ..and they let you check in like a hotel? come, i will explain. -Urinating here is prohibited- you stay here. hey thulley(cop), Look! wait, i'll show you. jaggu. sit back, we need to follow that car. but who is in the car? Story! quickly.. give me some money. thanks bye. I need to go inside. why? I want to meet that man. Its not a college canteen where you can go in and have a refreshment. its a lock up. Only people who do crime can go in. understand? madam, bribery is a crime. its a crime that's why i am. i can put you in. please do. only one hour. hi, i want to know your story. will you tell me? why? i am a TV reporter. It's my job. Ask what you want to. So what is your name? I don't have a name. but not sure why everyone call me PK. what do you do? I am astronomer. astronaut? people who go to moon? I have been there once. its absolutely dull place. ok, so what's your favorite planet? Our own one. thats for sure but apart from earth? Earth is banged up. i said my own planet. when its night its visible up there. ..we had a huge fuzz that day when we found there is similar planet like ours exist. where people like us live. they sent me here to do research, but shockingly somebody stole my spaceship's remote control. Without it i can't send signal home. and if i won't send signal nobody will come here to take me back. They'll think its a dangerous planet and i died here. listen, open the gate i want to go home. leave that up to us. i am not a thief. yes, all thief say the same thing. where is pandey ji. call him. he's not here. pandey ji. pandey ji! hey girl, keep quiet or else.. you think my story is nonsense? yes, your planet language can't be bhojpuri. our ball doesn't even.. our ball doesn't even have any language. we talk with mind. no room for confusion. here they say something and mean something else. one statement has four meanings. shake your head like this and say its good..very good. means all is well. make the eyes bigger and say "accha" it means someone is in shock. "your mother had an accident". "accha"? - Shock when one gets angry, voice becomes loud. "accha"? "you are teaching me"? and once someone thinks. there is a long "accha." "acchaaa" With words you need to learn the expressions as well. it was so damn confusing. took me 6 hours to learn bhojpuri. you mean in 6 hours you learned complete bhojpuri? Nobody was letting me hold their hand. but then i found a lady who co-operated with me. I hold her hand and transffered the whole language to me. hey you just can't stop blabbering. put some limit to your lie. Is your hand a USB cable that you can transfer file like one computer to another? huh? and what about your cloths? People in your planet also wear branded jeans? No No..in our ball nobody wears cloths. At first when i came here i thought people here have different skin. some have shining skin, some have black. some colorful and some absolutely white. some skin were tacky, some loose. then one day i found a car..dancing car. That day i realized people here have similar skin like us. They just put some objects known as fashion around their body. Now i could also meet with people from your planet ball. but not sure why everyone was laughing at me. took a little time to understand that male and female had separate fashion. Morning and night fashion was different. Playing sports and having toast fashion was different. With cloths i also found a picture. I slowly realized that this photo is very important in order to survive on this ball. In exchange to this photo, food to eat can be earned. hence i started collecting photos of this famous personality. what? why you giving me this? why you giving junk in my shop? aha, give me that. there you go, carrots. then i got this feeling that the value of this photo is only on one kind of paper. on other papers the value is zero. then gradually i managed to get cloths from dancing car. once i found such a wonderful attire that i didn't even need the paper with photo to get food. food came flying to me irresistibly. Now inorder to get my remote back i needed to learn this ball's language. without language nothing was possible here. for example telling this gentleman that i think his fashion may have some defect. I felt i messed up his fashion. that's why i recorrected. I found him on road, some jerk hit and ran. seems alright but he doesn't response. perhaps he's gone deaf? hey deaf! he does hear but not answering. i think he had a shock, and now memory loss. do you remember who hit you? do you remember the vehicle's number or anything at all? come with me. you are my guest until your memory comes back. keep banging your head, if a hit can take memory away it can return the same way too. I saw it in films. In order to understand what he was saying i needed to grab his hand and transfer the language. woah! Memory lost and you forgot the difference between male and female? one second, have a look at my license. sex - male, man, mister, jerk, bastard.. inorder to go back home, holding someone's hand was a priority now. here comes our jaunty guest. who doesn't differentiate male or female. licentious boy visited us as a guest. i can understand your pain, but don't hold anyone's hand here in public. I know sometimes luck can favor, but your life could get in danger. don't be sad, ok come with me. here you can hold anybody's hand or leg, nobody is going to assault you. This place was a paradise, everyone was very beautiful and friendly.. everybody wanted to hold my hand and take me to their home. then i met a very gentle and calm minded lady named phuljhariya. phuljhariya, take him to the honeymoon suite. she showed tremendous patience, and I till 6 hours kept transffering the language. 1, 2, 3, XYZ everything inside her i pulled everything. first time? your bulb fused before even started. eh? yea.. where do you live? I came from far away miss. you might not have even heard about my village. your language is just like mine though. i learned from you sister that's why. hey.. sister? mind your language. get lost! brother! wake up brother! you started talking! I need your help brother. what magic phuljhariya did on you? come with me quickly Apparently there is a direct connection between memory and sex. We have to tell this to the doctor. The most delighted operation of pleasure. There is a very important thing.. please come with me. hurry up. stop..stop! brother, that culprit snatched my necklace chain right at this spot. I need that chain brother. Is it expensive? Very expensive. its highly possible that thief is from our village. but as anyone can get caught easily here he must have tried to sell it in delhi So i have to go brother. where? Delhi. Mister. yes? My remote control has been stolen. Are you PK (drunk)? Police have no other work to do then finding people's tv remote? It wasn't tv remote. then? that i can't tell. but it was a very expensive necklace. Where it was stolen? in mandava. Rajasthan. Idiot ! It was stolen in mandava and you are finding it in delhi? yes but that theif came to delhi. so? he'll be found here. chucklehead! the population of this city is 1.5 crore. Police is also human not God. Now only God can help you. Praise the God only he can show you the right way. Only God knows where to find it. Only God would know..Now get lost. Have faith in God son. Who is this God who can help me. everyone is blabbering its name. What is saw blew my mind. The people of this ball knew who manufactured there planet. Infact he(God) was living with them only. In every street he had his house. Million of people go to his house with small fee and he takes away all their trouble. Such magic and miracle is not in my planet. I couldn't believe. I thought of giving it a try. Could you give me a god? Which one? 20 one? 50 one? 100 one or 500 rupee one? what is the difference in 20 one and 500 rupee one? Only size difference. rest is same. So the 20 rupee one works just fine as well. right? here, give 15 rupees. just take and go. God i am starving. Let me get something to eat. I went totally nut. this God seemed to be working. Now i could go back my home. God my remote control is stolen. Could you get that to me. i want to go home. This God's battery went down or what? It worked for a while and then choked. What do you mean? I mean put in a new battery. Hey it doesn't work with battery. Then why it doesn't work. it's a Manufacturing defect? We don't make defecting piece. you made this god? Yes. With my own hands. you made God or God made you? God has made us all. We have just made their sculpture. Why do you make their sculpture? So that we can pray and could talk to them about troubles. Does it have some sort of transmitter. How the messages reach to him? God doesn't need a transmitter. He hear us all directly. If he hear directly then what is the need of these sculptures? Oh man what to do with him? you want to close my shop? What is your problem anyway? My remote control is stolen i am asking God but he is not telling me anything. dude. you (PK) drunk? what you mean? hey how much overload you'll give to this little god? How he is going to run and chase the theif with such little feet? Get inside the temple there is a bigger God. He'll run faster and do your job quickly. Give this coconut and some money and he'll do the job. now give me 200 rupees. Everyone was waiting with a coconut and money inorder to get their work done. After 2 hours my turn came. God..God please get me my remote. where is it? come on. Move. but i didn't get what i wanted. Hey mister. He is not doing my work, I even deposited the fee. Will be done. When? How can i tell you that. It will be done. have patience. Give me the way. Move. But when will i get my thing? Don't block the line. Move futher. But what if God will give my stuff to someone else? you pk (drunk)? madam, just hang on. what are you doing? but where will i get my stuff? In mental hospital. How is that possible. I gave the cash here and delivery in mental hospital? Get him out of here. Atleast give me the receipt. give me the receipt. If someone will ask at Mental hospital what will i show as a proof? Get off. -but my remote? I can't find my chappal (mule) Someone might have taken it. you take someone else's. In temples such rotation is common. They took the payment but didn't do my job. his name? Bhagwan (God) Full name? i don't know the full name. where does he live? In the near by temple. you gave money in his hands? No. I put in his box. Did he say he is going to do your job? That's the problem. He doesn't talk. why? is he dumb? Maybe he is. Tell me his appearance. exactly like this. Only bigger in size. come here. Are you PK (drunk)? Yes. but how does everyone know? Are we all stupid? I am working 20 years as a police. takes me a second to know whoever is drunk. Kripal singh. Search him. See what's in it. -Dr. Demello. Doctor, Why do you drink so much that you even forget your religion? Instead of church you went inside temple? do you want a riot? you should go to your church, to your own God. church? but my stuff? because of your sin, the god is being crucified, and you... crucified when? 2000 years ago. for your sins. but what did i do? I just came here. you PK (drunk)? yes. God is watching your behavior. Where..where is the god? What is in that vessel? wine. Wine. Now i understood God became bored with coconut water, now he started enjoying wine and it was expensive. so i started gathering money. Some money i got from that dancing car. ..and some from that generous man standing on the bridge so that people can take as much as they want. bhaaisaab, Is there around a house of God somewhere? yes its right in front. wait. what's in it? Wine. For god. Where is he? One madam seemed very sad. inorder to know the reason i held her hand. Jerk! Trying on a widow? how do you know she is widow? you don't see white saree? So sad that your husband died. what when? how am i supposed to know. you are the one wearing white. In marriage everyone wears white. no white is when someone dies. black dress is when someone dies. Stupid. Get lost. what a co-incidence. All your 3 husbands died at the same time? hey i am still alive. After lots of punches and kicks i realized that there isn't a single God in this planet but instead many. Any every God has its own rules. Every God has opened their own company. People were calling it religion. There was a different manager for each religion. Every man in this planet was attached to one religion/company. and that person was strictly following that one manager of the company only. Now which company's member am i? which God should i pray? In order to get my remote knowing this was very important. What are you doing? Where is the hallmark seal? Which hallmark seal? The religious seal? Which company this child belong to.. How would one find that? Where does god put his stamp? finding my religion was turing out to be impossible. Now there was only one way.. to start praying Gods of all the religion. One of them must be my God. Who'd listen to me. There is a big confusion god. I am making some mistake for sure that you can't hear me. ask my trouble Atleast guide me. please Should i hold my hands or should i bow my head on your feet? Should i ring a bell or use a loudspeaker to wake you up? Should i follow geeta, kuran or bible? Every one of your manager says something different Some asks to fast on monday and some tuesday. some says to eat before sunrise, some after sunset. some says to pray cow, some says to sacrfice it. Some says to wear boots in your house, some says don't. I can't understand who to follow. it has become frustrating, God. I just want to go home. I'll do whatever you say. Just let me go home. please. Say something somebody amongst you, answer me please. please. please. hey why you locking? i won't let you go today. open the door, i have an entry. Shiv, who is the sin destroyer. not afraid of anything. gone. who are you? didn't recognise me? I am PK. Security. anybody there? -Drunk person is here. Shall i do skit in the toilet? Open the door..now first get me my remote. which remote? Spaceship's. spaceship? Forgotton? I told you so many times. I am not from this planet, came from far away. Just get me my remote and i'll go home. brother let me go, I have small children. i know it very well. Ganesh and kartik. They aren't little and can survive alone. you get me my remote and then go to your family. Oh god save me. there is a God above you? Om namah shivaya where is he? Save me! Somebody help! I was in the himalaya..meditating ..then suddenly i see light, from this small object on the ground. I closed my eyes thought about God, and i got enlighted. this object was so hot even in a very cold weather. God confirmed its the broken piece of lord shiva's pellet drum. embrace it. take it and put it in a temple. its auspicious sight will take people's trouble away. would you like to see it? praise the lord shiva. Lord shiva, miracle! stop. Let him come, he's excited. Lord Shiva, Greetings not there, here Say what you want to say here. Shiva is great. -Shiva is great. Lord where are you hiding? come upfront, accept my gratitude. He's right here. found him in the toilet. when i asked for my property, he ran. I thought he escaped but he brought me here to my property. praise the lord! Its not shiva's. its mine. Might have been a cross delivery. yours must be lost. Ask the lord. he is here. come in front lord. Its ok i will take my property. Since when you feel you don't belong here? you should meet a psychiatrist. Madam time to go. the punishment worth 500 rupees is over. one moment. here's my card. I could get you meet a psychiatrist. call me. you think my story is fake? so go on telecast nikku dog story on tv. you aren't lucky enough. pandey ji. I want to meet him once more. Instead give me 500 rupee more and take the whole man. i don't remember telling you about suicidal dog. because you didn't. how did you know? I read your mind when you held my hand. you thought my story is bogus, you have to manage with nikku dog now. don't lie. i must have told you. people in my planet touch hands and read minds. here people use false words. here let me show you. No way. Help me son. My wife is sick in the hospital. they need 10000 rupees. I am short with 500 rupees. If you will give 500 rupees.. -I'll give. There you go. -Write me your address i will return. its impossible to send money where i live. you keep it. Thank you son. Uncle! keep 100 rupee more for the tip. long live son. its proved now that you were lying. he made you fool. there is no hospital nearby. I know. he brought his wife for treat to a 5 star hotel. Today his wife's 75th birthday. She's never been to 5 star hotel. gradually he was collecting money from his pension. wife ordred an extra ice cream. he went out of money. he gave bathroom as an excuse and came here. what a crap. in our ball nobody lies. believe it or not. Its your birthday after all. Enjoy. Told you nobody lies in my planet. did you tell anybody? you didn't tell anyone that you are alien. right? No No. if i had they would caged me in a laboratory for experiment. then why trusted me? Since the day i came here, everybody took money from me. you were the first one put money for me in the donation box. I got a feeling that you are gentleman. can be trusted. I'll get you your remote. how? how i don't know. but you will go back home for sure. i promise. what for you gazing? aliens don't visit me often after all. Do everyone in your planet has such weird ear? yes and everyone stay naked? don't you find weird? that crow is sitting naked. looks weird to you? it be weird if will wear a tie. PK i kept thinking whole night how to get back your remote from tapasvi. -hello! -hello, connect me to balbir singh room no. 4. wrong number. -its not fortis hospital? -I have been telling you since yesterday its a wrong number. -how could it be wrong number. I myself saved it in the mobile phone. so what did you think? hello connect to balbir singh, room no. 4 you called so late, he died this morning. what? but how could someone die in haemorrhoids operation? yeah that's strange. but ok we will write in death certificate it was heart attack. family reputation should not be spoiled. -come take the body. -yes yes..umm on my... -BYE. why you said that? spreading happiness. He will have a good surprise once he'll see his friend alive. I fed up with his wrong numbers. so just duped him. duped? PK i was just kidding. I understood now the whole case. Someone is duping. whoever dials God's number for trouble via tapasvi never reaches God cuz he is duping everyone. Tapasvi ji is a fraud here. who dials wrong number. and someone sitting above is duping people. who is not a God. otherwise why would God call my remote their property? I feel.. ..the communication system between God and people in this planet is completely wrenched. that's why all managers ( gurus) call is going to a wrong number. meaning? that's why god was giving me illogical solutions to my problems. Sometimes he say come to my house rolling on the road then i will do your work. now tell me aren't we god's children? so normal parents would never tell their kids to do such horrible things. your father ever told you if you need a new dress you should roll on the floor? sometimes says shower me with cow's milk everyday. how illogical. Pk..if these cals would have reached the right number.. ..then what would he say? he would have said give milk and food to the poor people. ..why on earth you showering me with milk? I am sure someone is duping people like you did on phone. Pk thought tapasvi was honest. but i didn't say a word. i had an idea.. an idea that would get PK's remote. who is this PK? his identity is unknown. but he has a unique imagination. mean? - it means that.. if he'll spot you smoking he'll call police saying you are doing suicide. because packet states "smoking kills" what is the point? War. I want to collide tapasvi ji with PK on tv. it will be a one on one debate. jaggu.. i already have marks on my right butt. do you want it to be balanced out on the left butt too? No. the highlight of this debate will be that PK will not fight with tapasvi. Pk will just explain nicely that their prayers are going to a wrong number. tapasvi will have no idea how to answer him. cherry..cherry.. he is here. just meet him once. I challenge you, even you can't take away his confusions. trust me. please. it fell from your pocket. its not mine. kamasutra, strawberry flavor. I hate strawberries man. ask someone else. its not mine. what a weirdo. is it yours? -How dare you? - check your purse maybe something i missing. - dickhead. - uncle is it yours? - No not mine. Pk. that's his. whatever you want to ask, ask him. come. what's this? its condom. what's it use? it controls world population. how? by putting it on. ..while having sex. how is it controlled if you'd put it? Not if i put it on. millions of people wear it. do you give this everyone? everyone got it. I have a question. please go ahead PK. When money is dropped, everyone claims its mine. ..but when condom drops, everyone denies. why so? buddy sex is a very private subject. why? nobody announces the world that today i am having sex. then why in marriages..everyone announces the whole town with firecrackers & loud speakers.. that today i will have sex. what happened? I dont have a reply to that. ..but i do have a job for you. lets leave before he changes his mind. you better hide your butt now tapasvi, because my trishul (weapon) has launched. Pk..tapasvi ji meets everyday with their follower here. and pass their messages to God. we'll go in and listen to their phone calls. the moment you feel the calls are reaching wrong number, you start explaining tapasvi ji. then he'll return my remote? the day he'll understand someone is duping, and that object is not god's. he should return it. ok i will explain. to make someone's house is virtue. and to make god's house is the greatest virtue. donate in abundance. and get rid of all your troubles. say it devotee. what bothers you? tapasvi ji..my wife is paralysed since 6 months.. doctors can't help her.. i want that you.. God, show him the right path. direction.. as you say god. have you heard of rathong glacier? no Its in himalaya, catch the train and go to siliguri. ..from there in bus to gangtok.. from there.. by foot. it would take 8 days. In kanchenjunga mountain there is a huge god's temple. go there. your job will be done. its a wrong number. what it is? wrong number. tapasvi ji. the technology you are using to reach god is fused. all calls are reaching to wrong number. ..and there is a duplicate god sitting there who is duping you. what..what are you trying to say? i'll explain. we all are god's child right? yes. so? ..so if your child comes to you with his problem. what would you do? solve his problem. yes? or would you say.. 2000 km. away i have one more house. visit me there and explain me the same problem once again. then i will resolve. how illogical. if call would have reached the right god, he must have said take care of her. why left her and chasing me? once you will die, we will meet. atleast now spend time with her. right? i can prove. someone is duping here. call the god again. do you give guarantee that aunty will be fine? uncle, get written confirmation first. don't leave aunty without it. call now. everything will be clarified. its time for tapasvi ji's silence meditation. that duplicate god told you that my thing is yours. its not god, but fraud. its fraud. till now nobody has seen or heard about god. what god wants, his managers tell us. Pk raised an important question today. what? Do god really hear his managers. no the solutions is created by god or any fraud. coming from wrong number. so pk what should public do? till the telephone problem fixed. talk to each other and resolve problems. help each other. pk has a point. we should boycott these managers. instead support each other. just like... pk says this temple should not be build because that object is his. what's in your pocket? you smoke? yes and alcohol too.right? occasionally. you drink and smoke after knowing that it kills. government gives permit. factory makes this poison. its sold opening in shops. ..yet nobody objects. when in this holy ground we want to construct a temple then why objections? if you want to ask question, ask PK. is he muslim? or some anti hindu religion? you must ask PK these questions. and about his religion. mehmood gajni came many years ago. ..to destroy temples. today once again somebody came. can you call your god? he wants to know my religion right? first ask him what religion do their these kids have. is it a joke? call me and ask. its easy even i can answer. he's christian, he's sikh, he's jain and she's from your cast. could you reveal now? hello, i am sikh. i am muslim. i am jain. i am christian. and i am jagat janani. sikh. confused? i changed their cloths randomly. religion connection is with fashion. let me show you. beard and moustache means sikh. take out turban so hindu. if exclude moustache then muslim. This difference is made by wrong numbered god. had it been real god. he would have put his stamp on your body. do you have any? mine? what are you gazing? take off your cloths and check. why shy? come on all for tapasvi ji.. take off cloths and check your body for stamp. why shy? ok i do first. watch. do you see any religious stamp? do you see? wait let me take off... security. what are you doing? let me prove. that's not god's object. jaggu. finish this. you were 40 days old when tapasvi gave you your name. keep in mind he can give name, then ruin your name too. papa, he gave me the most ruined name. jagat janani. you. how much money you want? -papa -you're harassing tapasvi ji for money? no. you will burn in hell. have some fear from god. thank you..papa. thank you. i had incomplete knowledge. Now i know everything. this whole game is about fear. wrong number god is not just duping but taking advantage of our fear. whatever you know. could you explain papa? ofcourse. come. i don't have time for this non-sense. papa. deal. if it'll turn out to be non-sense. i will shut the show. papa, this college has exams. all students are terrified. now we'll start here business from fear. - come i will show. here's the machine in factory. some investment. here's the inauguration. now watch. in 15 minutes investment is double. there you go. this is how it begins. tea.. hot tea. look in tea business there is more investment. bicycle, cup, sugar, tea-pot, gas etc. and here..a stone and red color. tea..tea..hot tea. there you need to call customers. and here you have to blow them away. move, give others chance too. there you need to bow to customers. here customers bow to you. look, if someone is really scared he'll lay down completely wrong number god is doing business. business of fear. he knows, the one who scares goes to temple. you are also very coward. take this all off. don't stand against religion. its about faith. if god wanted that we don't raise questions then he wouldn't give us common sense. these religious businessmen when can't answer, gets violent. scares us and surpress us. but now we won't be quiet. now more pk will arise. friends, if you see anyone dialing wrong number, make their video and send us. we'll broadcast it on tv. ask questions, spread awareness one question, if you can emerge gold out of no where, when why don't you help poor? when you can emerge gold by yourself, then why ask donation from us? its a wrong number. - jaggu come with me. - wait - just come with me right now. you guys are on fire. whole world is sending wrong number videos. they said feed cow and you'll get job. is this cow will upload my resume on job websites? its a wrong number. more he said become christan otherwise god will send you to hell. if god wanted he would have made me born in christain family. now why making me change religion. wrong number. they all want to go to school. now there is a fatwa, if girls go to school, kill them. god can't be so mean that he has problem with their future. its wrong number. whatever is in our destiny, will happen. god has made only one masterplan for whole universe. you must accept that. outside temple your followers are selling your holy books in very cheap price. here if you read this 4 lines, you will have a new born son. it means get a 10 rupee book, read 4 lines and screw up the whole nature cycle. pk, your show is hit. whole word is texting. here, one more. what happend? dad sent message, he is ashamed of me. i was very little when i wrote my first poem for dad. i look like mother, says everyone. its true. but i am the daughter of my daddy. i narrated this poem in annual day. every parents in the crowd, applaud. amongst those clapping, my dad was whistling nonstop. clapping stopped, but whistling didn't. he was so proud of me. and today he wrote he is ashamed of me. he has some kind of illusion. the day he'll have clean mindset, he'll whistle non stop yet again. that day will never come. knock it off, come. i will show you what one does when in sorrow in my planet. here follow me. just copy me to get your battery recharged. ..and what are you doing exactly? close your eyes. -then how will i copy you? point. let it open then. gazing you, bearing you, i forgotton everything and just follow you. this is such a waste of time, love is a waste of time. then also i decided atleast once in this life, i will waste my time. love is a waste of time. many time i see mirror and do my hair. may time i changed my cloths and put deodrant. weird and unexplained feeling in my heart. not sure how to describe. I smile without reason, not sure what is going on. feel like flying and shouting. donation box has more questions than money guru. all your products have stopped selling. facebook and twitter is full of negative comments. only five? these are positive. rest bulk is with profanity. do something, we can't stay hidden long time. call him. now its our turn to ask questions. tapasvi wants to come to our show. -what? make pk ready. don't forget to watch, one more question at 6 pm. my friend has become star. he stays naked in public. i made him star. jackass is sitting in tv. and me here in this filthy place, in a smutty bar, drinking disgusting alcohol with a dumbass like you. made him star. bullshit! pk bhairosingh called, asking for you. brother. licentious boy. you have become a star. brother, where are you? Now i am mandava, but i am coming tomorrow along with a gift for you. The theif who stole your thing is in my abduction. he sold your stuff for 40000 rupees. ask to who. -to who -to tapasvi ji. god said its a broken piece of lord shiva's drum. god said take it and situate it in a grand new holy temple because its presence.. hello, what happened? the thief who stole my remote is caught. brother said, theif sold it to tapasvi ji. then tapasvi is in trouble. lets take thief to tapasvi ji, and ask him to return remote otherwise we will reveal the truth by theif on television. tapasvi ji didn't find my remote in himalaya. that means he is lying. that means wrong number is spread by tapasvi ji not duplicate god did you know about that? pk, remember the first time you talked about wrong number? whoever is trying to reach god, tapasvi ji is dialing wrong number for them. i knew in a second that you were not doing it right. but i didn't clear your confusion. because if you call tapasvi ji fraud his follower would've beaten you. people needed an creative solution. hold on. that's wrong number. and your examples with wrong number really pulled mass attention. today they are all supporting you. - its a wrong number. Pk my plan worked. we almost got your remote. you will leave tomorrow. i'll never see you again. will miss you. i will really really miss you. should i stay? don't joke. i am serious.

[train approaching] hey brother. [song playing on radio] one terrorist group was resposible for this attack ..they said it was only an example. nobody can mess up with our religion. ..we may save our religious belief till we are alive. where are you going? to the show its not important..leave it its very important now welcome to the show "one last question" lets welcome pk and.. - one moment. give me .. what is this? what is this, god says this is his. but he says it's his property. God says contruct temple, but he obstructs. now who shall we follow? GOD or him? he was wearing yellow helmet and distributing this.. have a look first he stated God is missing, later called him fraud. tomorrow he might say god is dead. son, what are you upto? ..a world where god doesn't exist? Do you have a clue about common people's pain. ..there is no food to eat no house to live. no friends to talk.. many commit suicide everyday cut their wrist, hang themselves on ceiling. ..because they don't have hope. if worshing god.. ..following customs and praying gives them hope then who are you to take their hope away? and if.. ..you really want to detach people from god, then tell us what would you give us in return? enough of these "wrong number" allegations. instead tell us today what exactly is the right number. you are right once even i didn't have food to eat.. no place to live i used to cry a lot ..as i didn't have any friends either. that time i only had one support ..God. every morning felt like tomorrow will be less worse, god will do something. i agree.. that believing in god gives hope. ..gets strength to cope with pain. but i have a question. which god to trust? you say god is one. i say wrong.. there are two gods. one who created us ..and second whom you created. i don't know anything about the one who created us. but the one you created.. is exactly like you. small, liar, corrupted, makes false promises. he meets rich quickly, and makes poor wait in queue. gets happy when appreciated. frighten people over small things. I have a simple point. trust god who created us. and strike out the fake god you created. and you think we'll stay quiet? Son, we know how to protect our god. you will protect god? ..you? this planet very small million bigger planets are out there in space. and you are sitting in that small planet, in small city, in small room, talks about protecting god? the one who created this whole life? he doesn't need your protection. he can protect himself real good. today somebody tried to protect their god and my friend died. only this shoe is left. stop protecting the god, or else in this planet only shoes will be left, no humans. one muslim blows a bomb and one hindu guru is listening your lecture. nice. where is the stamp to prove that you are hindu and i am muslim? this difference is created by mankind. and that itself is the most dangerous wrong number of this planet. due to this people die. the same wrong number you struck in jaggu's brain and separated her from sarfaraz. what wrong number? that sarfaraz is dishonest. you told that muslims are dishonest. so he cheated. where's the lie? one second. -no hang on. what is going on? hang on one moment. so you are telling me that my prediction was wrong? duh, ofcourse. then prove it. prove it that my prediction was wrong. and if you couldn't.. you would lay on my feet and beg for forgiveness. or if i prove it then? pk don't. then this is yours. challenge accepted. could we point the cameras at jagat janani? we hope you would co-operate with us and tell the truth. you fell in love in belgium with a pakistani man. yes or no? why are you discussing my personal life in public? on friday 3:21 pm i predicted that.. he'd deceive you. and next day.. you went to marriage registrar office, but this man didn't come. yes or no? yes he didn't come. now can you please stop this? now..would you bring yourself to my feet, or shall i bring my feel there? sarfaraz didn't cheat. pk let it go, please no please tell everyone what exactly happened. pk please. just once, for my sake. I was waiting and a letter arrived. did sarfaraz himself delivered? no he sent through a kid. did it have any name on it? noooo. then how did you know it was sarfarz's letter? it could've been for some other woman. place didn't have another woman? there was one with a cat. and she gave you cat to carry. kid who delieved letter, did he know you? No did you know him? no then how would he know that he should give letter to you. perhaps he's been told to deliver letter to woman with cat. he gave you letter. you read.. and didn't even call sarfaraz later? did you call him? no. because tapasvi ji struck wrong number in your brain. that muslims are dishonest. sarfaraz didn't cheat you jaggu. what's going on here? dog, cat.. you will keep inventing stories and we'll stay quiet? one moment. the truth will be revealed now. call sarfaraz. the number does not exist. any other number friend, college, something? come on jaggu.. Belgium university. pakistan residence number. don't have. - think jaggu darling. I do part-time job in pakistan embassy. he was working part-time in pakistan embassy. call pakistan embassy and put on speaker. Greetings, pakistan embassy. hello..umm did you ever had sarfaraz yousuf from lahore working for you? Is your name jaggu? hello is your name jaggu? yes but how did you know? everybody..she called from india. jaggu called from india. come here. Miss, sarfaraz yousuf calls us every morning at 9:00 am. and gracefully asks only one thing.. that someone from india named jaggu called today? we say no and he disconnects. made us completely mad. hold on, we'll connect you to him. [phone rings] hello - mr. sarfarz yousuf? - yes, greetings. where are you calling from? umm from lahore, why? where are you right now? i am at my home. why? do you have any chair or bench around you? if yes please sit down, because you may fall after shock. pardon me, i didn't get you. there is a call for you from delhi. there you go, have a word. - hello - sarfaraz! jaggu jaggu is everything ok? did you come to the marriage registrar office? - yes i did. but you left. why did you never call? how could i ? I found your letter stating never contact me. I knew you had a huge pressure from your family. but not sure why i always felt you'd try to contact me someday. you are terribly late. what i could've done? I had wrong number. just got a right number from a friend. Thank you son. hold this for a sec. PK, you taking batteries with you? - yes i don't get it there. but what would you do with so many batteries? i'll listen to the voices recorded in cassettes. what kind of voices? voices of your earth's birds, crows and traffic. you'd listen to traffic noise? I would do that when i'll miss your planet. wait up, i have one more trunk to unload. pk let it go. how could i let it go? there are more batteries. do you hear me? driver, do you hear? in your planet everyone has such weird ears? everyone stays naked? what are you looking at? is there any dirt on my face? you know i was in 10th when i wrote my first poem? for my dad. i look like mother everybody says, everybody says, they say truth.. poetry means less words, deep meaning. by the way you are really cute. one more toast for a friend, who... [jaggu singing] there wasn't any bird, crow or traffic.. every tape had only my voice. [tape scrambling] got it. prick made me run a lot. what did you record in it, pk? told you so, bird, crow and traffic. when ever your earth would rotate, i will play this tape. I will wave hand vigorously. you also wave hand.. ..if get time. it doesn't have my voice right? your voice... it is. one of your poetry is there. only one poetry? ofcourse, why would i waste my time completely on you? after all i don't love you. he didn't look back even once. perhaps he was hiding his tears. he learned some and taught some. he learned to lie. and taught the true meaning of love. love me enough, to let me go. he also came here without cloths.. just like a newborn child. He also used to ask millions questions just like a child. and then oneday he was gone. around 4000 million k.m away. at the end he gave me two beautiful gifts. sarfaraz and my father. i will gaze at his star till i am alive. and wave. i am sure he'll do the same. i miss him. one year later.. brothers in an hour we'll land on earth. don't forget what i taught you. only four major points. 1. its prohibited to walk naked there. this kissing stuff and naked tasks are being performed unseen, behind four walls. thing which is allowed in public are fight, war and cussing etc. 2. biggest confusion here is language. if you hear in market that i'd like chicken/fish. that doesn't mean they love animals. it means they'll eat them for lunch today. we will research why there is a difference in what they speak and think. 3. we'll steal cloths from the dancing car right after landing. then please insert your remote in your underwear. ..really really deep inside. don't want anyone to steal. and 4. most importantly if you meet someone who says he can help you contacting God. ..then to hell with research. just take a U-turn and run for your life in full speed. come bro, don't be scared. come. what for you gazing? eh? I have a question. what? last time how many times you got beaten up? what's that for? self defense. aha, safety! let's go -yes let's go. not that direction. this direction... subtitle created by -Arpan Bhatia-
