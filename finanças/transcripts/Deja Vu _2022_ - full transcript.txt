Boss. My boss! ‪My boss! Daddy! - How are you? - I'm fine. My ice cream? See... Daddy is tired, and daddy needs to rest. So you go play with your sister. Don't play rough, okay? But Daddy, Daddy! Mommy, what's wrong with dad? There is noting wrong with him. Your dad has been working all day and he is tired. Mummy I was upstairs, I saw your reaction. You guys were happy this morning. - You saw my reaction? - Yeah. From where? - Upstairs. My room. - Hey! Omotayo! You were watching? You know I've warned you several times about the things you do and the words you say. Hm. They are above your age. But... Okay. Dad is fine. Ah, leave it! Your ice cream is in the car. Share with your sibling. Em... - Duni. - Ma! I'll be with you in a moment. - You are welcome ma! - How are you? Hope you're fine. What's the matter? Don't be offended. I was busy with some chores in the kitchen, so I decided to round off before coming to you. Don't be offended. Alright. Help get the children's ice cream from the car. - The car key is on the table. - Okay ma'am. Tolu, how are you? Please! I don't know how it came about. I don't understand. I don't understand. Why can't you be patient with me? May you be begged in a bad manner! You didn't know how it came about because it is natural not to know how things come about when you get involved in nonsense. What nonsense talk... What nonsense are you saying? Bimpe, do you know what you are saying? Okay, the DNA test... ‪The result is fake! Is it fake? Look at the way she is nodding her head. If I give you slap... You are lying and at the same time nodding stupidly. Ah ah! Do you want to hear the truth? Take those bastards to their father. Take those bastards to their biological father. It means I've been taking care of another man's children all the while. Johnson! Women are mad oh! So I've been taking care of bastards?! They are not bastards but our children. Are you alright?! If I elbow you... Take the bastards to their biological father! Can you hear the nonsense she's telling me?! Johnson... our children are not bastards. I'm sure the result is fake. - It is fake. Because I don't understand. - Keep quiet! - What nonsense are you talking about? - It's a mix-up. Please shut up. Stop explaining rubbish. - It is a mix up that you are promiscuous. - Ah! It is a mix up that you are an adulteress. You are not a good woman. - You brought bastards to me. - Me? Ah! This woman has really gone mad oh. -Johnson -The more I see you, the more upset I get. If you don't want me to misbehave, kindly take those bastards to their biological father and leave my presence. Like, right now! My love, please. If you touch... Are you mad? Who is your love? - I am not an adulteress. - Who is your stupid love? I will elbow you and you'll drop dead. Are you mad or something? - My love, please. - Who is your love? ‪Oh... You are mad. - Take them to their biological father. - Johson please. Not only Johnson but Adewale Ayuba. ‪Oh. ‪Oh. Johnson, don't tell me you're not the biological father of those two children? The way it surprises you, is the way it surprises me. Like, I still can't... I still can't unravel... - I still can't unravel it. - Johnson... It seems like... It's just as if my heart has been struck with a dagger. I understand. The truth is... that I wouldn't have known. It's only because the DNA result - is part of the travel requirements. - I know, right? Bimpe hid all that from me. Women are mad! I understand... I have instructed her to return the children to their biological father. Take it easy, Johson. What did Bimpe say after you both saw the results? What would she say? Is she not a woman? Women are heirs of deceit. All she kept saying was they were not bastards. Am I stupid? Would the DNA results lie? Whoa! - This is difficult to take. - Oh! I am surprised myself. I've told her the truth. I'm just giving her only a week to get those children out of my house, and if not... - Ah! - No, Johnson, take it easy. Johnson look here... You may not be their biological father, but it is you they know. There is nobody without a source. At least, she has got parents that gave her to you in marriage. Let's get her family members informed. So we don't seem bad to them. Whether the family knows or not, let her take the bastards to their biological father. I'm just shocked because I have never caught her in any promiscuous act since we got married. - Exactly. - So... The way she's... I am going crazy. Argh! - Honestly, I'm amazed. - Ahh, a woman's heart is heinous. Yes, I know. - A bungalow can be built in there. - This is well known. - Are you just getting to know? - So secretive! There is nothing new under the sun. The next thing is to look for the way forward now. The way forward should be our concern now. Please, don't kill yourself with anxiety. - Adebimpe, my dear. - Yes ma? I know you will be surprised why we have come to the head of the family. The reason I brought you to the head of the family is because you are such a darling girl, and you are a girl I love. So, if there's anything not clear ‪we must be able to talk amicably about it. Our people say, "A corpse will not hide from the one that will bathe it." ‪Yes. Our people also say, "Three generations don't suffer. If a mother does not make it, her child will. And if the child doesn't, the grandchild will surely do." - Yes. - Talk less of God's goodness to us. But what about these shortcomings? Ah! It scares me and I'm not at rest. -Adebimpe -Mom. It's concerning your children's paternity. ‪The case of bringing bastard children, let your mind be at rest. If you look back, it's me that you'll see. If truly there was a mistake... nobody is above mistake. Like the westerners would say, "Nobody is above mistake." ‪Yes. So, what is it that you can't expose? Just tell us and we'll know how to go about it. Johnson is my son and has got no other mother beside me. Whatever I say I want, he must oblige. - Just as the family head obliges. - You are correct. You'll also have peace of mind as you continue to live happily together. Just confess to me. How did you come about the children? Mother, -truly, you are my mother-in-law -You're right. but you have taken me as your daughter and I have taken you as my mother. I can't lie to you. - I have told you everything. - Are you sure? Yes I am. But the DNA says he is not the children's biological father. That's what I don't understand. - Because... - Er, Look, Adebimpe... Sir. What I want to say is this. - See us as your biological parents. - Yes sir. Do you understand me? You'll notice that since you joined this family, we have treated you like our daughter. She is a woman and that's why she is given to much talking. I don't talk much. If you're sure of what you're saying, there's no problem, - then come swear in the Motherhood Shrine. - Huh? Why not? That's where she will swear. She will have to go to the shrine, I don't have time for nonsense. You will swear at the Motherhood Shrine. Mom, what's motherhood shrine? Motherhood Shrine! Hey! - Adebimpe! Hmm! - Mother. I didn't know this matter would be this escalated. You see Motherhood shrine... Hey! ‪When a hero's head is called for, ‪the cutlass must be sharpened. Motherhood Shrine... Motherhood Shrine. It is a shrine where you must not lie. - Its judgment is instantaneous. - Instantaneous. One doesn't get home before its judgment strikes. The person will just die. It will be good if it's only the culprit that becomes a victim, but his generations unborn will also suffer the consequence. - Motherhood Shrine! - Mm. It's okay. If it is to swear at the Motherhood Shrine to affirm the paternity of my children, - then I'm ready. - Ha! I am ready to go because I've got nothing to hide. My husband, Johnson, is the biological father of our children. Adebimpe... Mom. It is often said that a corpse won't hide from the person who will bathe it. Just tell me whatever is behind this matter. Once you explain to me, I'll know how to apply wisdom. Eh, listen, I don't consent to going to the shrine because whatever involves traditional approach or witchdoctor will always boomerang. -Mom, -My darling, - don't put me to public disgrace. - Mm! Mommy, what are you also talking about? I'm not happy with your words. Don't you trust me anymore? How won't I know the paternity of my children? I, Adebimpe, promiscuous! You should trust your daughter. You should know I can never have an extramarital affair. I can't change my children's paternity, Mom. I haven't known any man since I got married to my husband. - Hehe! - I'm not that kind of a woman. I also don't understand what is happening, Mother. Meanwhile, if everybody won't believe me, then you should. - Don't you trust me? - Not that I don't... I trust you very much. Am I not your mother? A child won't mistake her mother's identity for another. I'll persuade you because you are my daughter. Yes, the matter is truly unbelievable. It's because you are my biological child and I believe that no, you can't act in that manner. That is why I am pleading with you. The matter is confusing. I didn't have an extramarital affair. Mom, I'm confused about the whole matter. We have gone to two different places to carry out the test and the results are the same. I'm being made to understand that my husband is not the biological father of my children. - Ha! - I don't understand. I know I didn't have an extramarital affair. So I'm ready to go anywhere they want to take me. I didn't have an affair. My husband is the biological father of our children. Mom, you need to be praying for me because I don't understand what is going on. It is confusing. ‪As for me... Mine is that God has never hidden anything from me. God will surely deliver us from this - because I've never heard such in my life. - Mom... Woman, what are you searching for in my phone that you are pressing it like a typewriter? Can't I check your phone? If there is nothing therein that you are hiding, why will you be asking what I am doing with your phone? ‪But you have checked it now ‪and didn't see anything incriminating. Salako, you're deceiving me. You will one day be exposed. You still behave like a kid. Kindly return the phone when you're done searching through. Have you heard? I will one day crash your confidence. - Happy pressing oh. - I will press it. You can help download good games on it. Investigator. What God showed me about Sister Bimpe was powerful and it is a mystery. Real mystery. Er, this is what we'll do... You and Sister Bimpe will go on seven days of fasting. Then I'll join you in the spirit on the seventh day. Fasting?! Seven days?! It's okay, we shall start immediately. Let's start immediately. This is going to be Sister Bimpe's prayer point. "Oh Lord, shine your light on the darkness in my life." You will also talk with God in your prayers by saying, "Lord please, shine your light over the darkness in my daughter's life." Yes, that will be your prayer point. Let's now wait and see what God will do after the seven days. I believe that God will shine His light on everything that is covered by darkness in Sister Bimpe's life. God will as well expose all the secrets in the dark. It's alright. I've heard you, sir. Thanks so much sir. May God continue to renew your strength! Bye sir. Hello dear, how are you? I want to see you. Right now Okay. Thanks. I've heard you. I'll be expecting you. My dear, Pastor and I have discussed. He said so much, but the most important thing in all that he said is that we will have to fast and pray. Fasting? Yes. I know you don't like to fast, but you've got to fast over this matter. At least, you know that whatever Pastor says is true. Without much ado, you will fast and we shall do it together. I've got no choice than to fast. But, when do we start? And how many days will it take us? We'll start immediately. He says he will join us on the seventh day and round it off with prayers for us. ‪Oh God! Oh God, have mercy on me and deliver me from all these troubles. ‪Mercy. Now, I'm supposed to start tomorrow but I won't be able to start. Yes. Because of the shrine my husband's family is taking me to tomorrow. They want me to enter this night and I must. Ah! I must go because my husband's people are not joking. It is a must for me to go and if I don't, hmm... I pray I don't encounter trouble. It is compulsory. You see this their deity, I don't consent to that. Because I can't imagine people still visiting the shrines in this modern age. Above all, you'll still have to go. What can we do? We have to go with them. So they won't start thinking you are adulterous. Hope you understand? - Just be at rest. Nothing will happen. - I've heard. So, we'll start our fast after visiting the shrine? That's how we'll do it. There's no other alternative. Adebimpe, listen to this. Don't quarrel with your husband. Don't quarrel with your husband, especially at this time. Avoid it. Just take things easy with him until the solution to all these problems comes. Also, don't let the children know that something is wrong, because such issues dishearten children. Hope you understand. Mother, trust your daughter. I'm not a troublesome person. I won't quarell with him. All that I ask for is your prayer so that there will be a solution. - I am tired. - It will soon be over. - Oh God, have mercy on me. - Just be patient. Drey, he just exited the house. You will soon see him drive by. Kindly trail him for me. He said he was going to the airport. Hope you know his white Venza. That's what he took. Kindly trail him. I want to know all his movements. I want to know all that he does. Okay ma'am. That's my job. I will trail your husband. I will trail him everywhere he goes, and inform you about his movements. I also want to appreciate you for the money sent to me. I got the alert. You are welcome. Get on it fast. Go quickly. Okay ma'am. No worries ma'am. This man keeps following after ladies with slim feet. Am I not pretty enough. Eh? Is Salako fed up with me? Oh, my God! Any day I catch Salako red handed... ah, he will admit God is boss! There is a number he frequently calls recently. It must be the number of an unfortunate girl. What's that number? And I tried to memorize it. 0873... Ah, I can't remember very well. I can't remember. 087... Do you know I've been telling you that if you are charitable, don't use my shop for charity. Why will you give people goods on credit? People buy goods and not pay and yet you still want to collect salary at the end of the month. Look, this is the last warning I'm giving you. Anything you sell on credit, no matter how little, will be deducted from your salary. That's it. Mother, don't be offended. I had to pity the person who came to buy goods on credit. Can you hear yourself? Are you doing charity with my shop? Where you collect salary! Showing pity... I've told you that you could do charity when you become independent, As for my shop, it's like placing the god of iron on the ground, which ruins people's lives. I'm being honest with you. Don't sell my goods on credit. If you do, I will calculate the cost of whatever you sell on credit and place the money equivalent of such on the god of iron. That's it. Go and bring in the goods. Mm, here she is. - Mommy, good afternoon ma. - You are welcome. I've not got much to say. Someone lied against you, which I rebuffed. But now I want to confirm from you if it was a lie. I learnt you said you couldn't visit the Motherhood Shrine, because your religion does not permit it. What religion is that? Mommy, I never said that. - So what did you say? - It's all a lie. I never said that. I only said we should look for other ways to sort things out. What other ways? -I was told you brought bastards home, -I didn't... and here you are suggesting other ways. Are you a Christian, a Muslim or just being syncretic? Mommy, I didn't bring bastards home. You know I have been trying to talk to you in a gentle manner. I haven't called the crowd on you. If I had wanted to do it properly, I would call the entire community to tell them what happened. Honestly. As well-dressed as you are! Mom, please don't be annoyed. Please beg yourself! - Baby. - Hmm? ‪Honey please! Baby. I'm tired. The anti-malarial drugs I took affected all my body systems. Let's postpone it till tomorrow morning. ‪Let's meet in the morning please. - Salako, you'll make it up? - Hmm, ‪-Definitely. ‪-Okay. Is this your attitude proper? If you don't have headache, you will have liver pains. Something is always wrong everyday. You would have expended all your strength on those licentious young girls and afterwards become useless in the night and not able to perform. I am also human. This is not fair. Why are you treating me like this? You need to hear me out sometimes. You saw me take drugs. What was it that I was distributing? - Is my body rituals? - It's okay. It's okay. - Er, I... - Eh, shh, it's alright. Don't bother. Tomorrow. Leave me alone! Good night. Good night. ‪What is this? What kind of nightmare is this? A calabash is suspicious, it breaks. ‪A ceramic is suspicious, it tears. ‪Arigini‪ does not trouble nor endanger. ‪Your name does not endanger. ‪If a young man ‪or old man wishes you dead, ‪even if they rush at you in the market, ‪you will conquer them all. Tayo, it's time to go to bed. Your dad will rebuke me if he finds that you are still up by now. I am not sleeping. I want to see my mom. Ah, mommy's pet. Mommy is coming. Eh? Go and sleep. I don't want to have issues with your dad. Please go to bed. Go to bed... You're welcome sir. ‪-How are you? ‪-Fine sir. How are you? Why is she still awake? That's what I've been telling her. She has just been asking after her mommy. Meanwhile, I told her she'll soon be back. - Her sibling is already asleep upstairs. - Eh? ‪-Mommy! ‪-Sit down. - What is it? - I want to see my mom. Want to see your mom? See, she travelled. She has called me. She will be back tomorrow. - Are you sure? - Yes, I am sure. So you need to go sleep now, alright? ‪Go on. C'mon. Go to bed. Thank you. Bye sir. ‪-Good night sir. ‪-Sleep well. ‪-Yes sir. ‪-Dad, good night Goodnight dearie. What kind of trouble is this? I have just been taking care of someone else's children. Won't they call me a mad man if I suddenly begin to vent anger on the innocent children? And I love these kids. Baba, I don't understand this matter anymore. I have gone to repeat the DNA test and the result still shows that both kids are not mine. - So what are you saying? - Oh, wow! You are here asking us to congratulate Bimpe. Congratulate her for what? Didn't the motherhood idol see Bimpe's secret? Because I don't understand. - I don't understand. - Take it easy. Calm down, young man. You'll have to be patient, because something else is hidden in this matter. Meanwhile, word is a mystery. If it is not explained, it is not understood. How do you mean? We need to critically examine it. What do we do now? If the lady was adulterous, she would have died immediately she stepped into the shrine and her children would have run mad. Is anything wrong with her children? They are all fine. Can you see?! Something inexplicable happened which forced me... to enter the shrine. On the third day this lady entered the shrine, the gods showed me some revelations which I don't really understand. I don't really understand it because I didn't see beyond that. So I went into the shrine. Meanwhile, some things happened that had never happened. Thunder struck and tempest raged and nothing happened to Bimpe. God, your highness. What could be the cause? What's happening? So I inquired from the deities and they made me to understand that it requires patience. We'll need to ‪appease the gods. We shall get to know the cause within the next seven days. Arogunmasa, may you always experience success in all your endeavors. So shall it be. - The deities will not leave you. - Amen. I know you have never failed at any attempt. So, what shall be the elements of the sacrifice and appeasement? So what you're insinuating is that I'm going to wait for another one week. I will have to wait for a week again. Is that not what you're trying to say? My dear, this matter requires patience. At least, you heard what the witchdoctor said. Please take it easy. Look here! I don't want you to argue over this matter. Take your wife and go home. Do you understand? I will give you a call to inform you about any possible outcome. I don't want you to cause any trouble on this matter when you get home. - Hope you heard me. Yes. - Thank you sir. Take care, son. I trailed him to the hotel and monitored him till he went in. It was a man he went there to meet. Yes, I'm sure it was a man. In fact, he didn't stay long and thereafter he headed straight for the office. And you are so sure he went to the office. Eh? Ma'am, trust me. He went straight to the office. In fact, I'm right beside his office. I will still continue to trail him. You have given me a job and I will do it very well. I will let you know once I discover anything wrong. Call me as soon as anything changes. Okay? Okay ma'am. No problems ma'am. Aunty Mosun! - Aunty Mosun! - What? You have not stopped all this nonsense, monitoring your husband. Is that not the guy you hired to be monitoring your husband? I pity you. You better not develop high blood pressure. Huh! What is the matter? Why are you talking to me like that? Leave me alone. What have I said that is beyond me? Tell me. What have I said that is beyond me? I can't be your younger sister and not tell you the truth. Do you understand? I really want to ask, what else do you want this man to do for you that he hasn't done? No! Uncle has satisfied you with everything. Yet you still monitor him around as if he is a child. You are not content with where God has placed you, and peace of mind He has given you. You now monitor your husband. You'd better not become anxious unnecessarily. Eh... okay. ‪Wait a minute... Let me ask you a question. If Uncle gets to know that you monitor him to the point that you hired somebody to be trailing him, then he will know that you don't trust him. What will you do? How will he get to know? Will you be the one to tell him? Tell me! Gossipmonger! Will you be the one to tell him? Leave me alone. I love my husband so much. But you see those ladies out there... they're terrible. They all have doctorate degree and can remove one's heart and replace it with an artificial heart. So let me watch over him. My auntie, just take things easy. Just take things easy. Everyone has got his problems to manage. Yours can't become mine. I have told you. Listen, leave that alone. Nothing will go bad. It's those that want to cause problems that I want to deal with. Let's leave that. Now I remember there's a wrist watch I saw on your status. I like it so much. It's very nice. So you want to divert attention away from the more important thing I am discussing with you. No problems. What's the colour? It looks like gold. Though I don't know if it's imitation but I like it. Lord, Holy Spirit, shine your light upon my darkness. You say in your Word that you'll do whatever I ask. Keep shut and stop disturbing me. - What's this nonsense all about? - Lord, I commit Johnson into your hands. Kindly lay your hands on him and change his mind. - Hand shall be laid on you. - Oh Lord! You're the one who really need a change of heart. ‪Oh, Lord! Oh Lord... Lord, please change his mind. You better get serious about your matter. Oh Lord, I'm not adulterous. I have never been promiscuous. ‪Oh Lord in the name of Jesus. ‪Lord I'm not adulterous, I'm not wayward. Lord, don't let my home scatter. Good evening ma'am. Good evening ma'am. It is you I'm greeting. Madam! Madam! ‪Lasisi. - Duni. - Good morning. Is the matter you want to discuss that urgent? - It's worse than that... - You didn't even allow the day to break. It's not been long my boss stepped out. Please, don't be offended. There was something I heard and I need to inform you about it. Okay, let's go and discuss it. What's really the matter? I went to buy something in the estate, so I saw Jasper, one of the guards. As we were both discussing about the chaos at home... Anyways... he said he saw madam come out of a house in the night I wondered what madam could be looking for at midnight. I'm like... - This is strange. - Which madam? Our Madam, Brother Lasisi. In fact, he said he had seen her twice. Though he said she was sleep walking. He said she entered the house and came out but I wonder what she was looking for. - Which madam? - Our madam. Brother Lasisi, for me to be sure, Jasper took me to that house. Brother Lasisi, I have come to tell you because I know you are close to madam - so she can quickly do something about it. - Hmm... Truly, our boss's mother treats me like a son and she narrated, to an extent, what happened, - but... - There's no but, Brother Lasisi, no but, look, I will ask you to tell her, - so she can quickly find a solution. - It's alright. - Thanks for your concern. - Thank you. We shall look at what needs to be done. I know your interest is to get things resolved but I know our boss's wife is not promiscuous. I know. She's not a... But what is the sleep walk all about? Ah! It's alright. No problem, You can go. Let her do something about it. Let me go do some chores. Bye. Those unfortunate girls with tiny legs. - Hello, Ayomide, the husband snatcher. - Hello? What stupid hello are you saying? You're not even scared. You've got the guts to respond when I called! Anyway, I called to warn you to leave my husband alone. Because if you don't leave him alone, you'll face the music. So leave him alone. Your life shall be ruined for that which you just said. A housewife who can't keep her husband. Will your husband be snatched if you know how to take good care of him? Can you hear this shameless brat? Are you even a human being? So your parents will think they've got a daughter. You that should have been aborted. Anyway... I just called to inform you that if you don't leave my husband, if I turn and land on you, you'll die, you'll just die! In fact, your corpse won't be found. It seems you are mad. It shall not be well with you. Housewife, go and look for a job and stop cursing little children early in the morning. Look here, I'm not Ayomide. I am Aduke, so you've called a wrong number. I'll curse you any day you call my number. - Get off my line, unfortunate woman. Ah! - Ha! Ooh! Ha! I actually called a wrong number. How did I make such a silly mistake? How did I copy a wrong number from Salako's phone? And the guy has changed his password! How do I get this Ayomide's number? Am I not the one? I'll get it. I'll get that girl's number. It seems this girl has something mysterious on her body. Why should I continue to make mistakes?! I greet you all. - We will have a breakthrough today. - Thank you. The oracle says you should all take it easy. ‪The witness to all that happens... ‪Moku the racer, father of Otun. ‪Gbolajoko, child of Okiki ‪who makes elephants to trumpet. ‪Osadesan. The hippopotamus of Owo town. That your matter will soon turn to joy. So shall it be. There is much to talk about but I will make it brief. I have made the sacrifices the oracle instructed me to make and that before seven days, light will shine. ‪Because egret is not a night bird, ‪the knowing ones ‪should not act like night birds. ‪A night bird should not abide with us ‪because a diviner's house is bright. For this girl that sleep walks, who knows any other house she enters among those sitting here? ‪-Truthfully! ‪-Baba, I do! I know the house she exits because I am the estate security. So I know the house she enters. Good job. Baba, I don't understand. How will someone see me in the midnight? Mother. I don't think so. There is a mix up somewhere. I'm sure it's not me. You are not sure. Get out. You are not sure. What mix up?! You are still denying what you did. Is there something wrong with you? Take it easy. I remember something. My dear, what is it you remember? I know some of those times Bimpe had sleep walked. -Babe, -Mm? Where are you going? I'll be back in a moment. What you mean you'll be back? - Where are you going to? - I'll be back. The way you sleep walk these days is terrible. This is getting out of hand. It's better I don't sleep so she does not get up again. ‪You were actually used. We thank you because you have answered. In Jesus' name our Lord. - Amen in Jesus' name. - Amen in Jesus' name. Hmm, joy is here. How was your night? It was fine. I thought about something all through the night and I feel we need to talk about it. What's that? It's about your sleep walking. It's becoming more often. It's getting me scared. So I don't know. I think we should go seek medical attention this weekend. Medical attention? Is it medically related? Yes, it is. Sleep walking is a type of disorder also known as parasomnia. It originates while asleep resulting to complex behaviors. That's what the Yorubas call sleep walking. Yeah. Anyone suffering from parasomnia, could wake from sleep and start misbehaving. It is more common among children than adults. That's serious. What's the solution to that? Is it spiritual? Spiritual? No, not at all. It's not spiritual! Well, according to sleep experts, 41% of children sleep walks if one of the parent has a history of it. Then 69% will sleep walk if both parents has a history of the disorder. It can also be stress induced. It can be caused by drunkenness, insomnia, drug overdose. A lot factors can be responsible for it. There's also, what is known as Obstructive Sleep Apnea and restless leg syndrome. They're also sleep disorders that cause sleep interruptions. Yeah. Doctor, what do we do? What do we do? What's the way out? Well, it's not something too serious but we must first carry out tests to diagnose the cause. Just as I said, many things could cause it. The stress you go through everyday can also be responsible. We can only proffer solution upon diagnosing the cause. So, after carrying the test, we'll know what we're dealing with? Of course. Once we see the results, then we'll know what to do. - Thank you so much doctor. - You're welcome. Hold on! What do you young people want to turn this world into? When did sleep walking become a sickness that you would have to go to the hospital for complaints? Is there treatment for sleep walking? Someone help me! Hey! - Take it easy. - Hmm. Let's apply wisdom. ‪So that one won't be blamed, there is no lie in what the young man said. ‪-Really? ‪-There's no lie here. If you can recollect, on the first day you came, in my revelation and investigations, I said somebody was sleep walking and was entering a particular house. That was how far I was able to see. Thereafter, I consulted the oracle and the oracle made it clear. What is precisely the solution? - Right? - Yeah, correct. What do we do? We must act fast. I want to get to that house she enters to have a dialogue. How would the one sleep walking know the house she enters? - Mommy, I know the house she enters. - That's great. Kudos. - I know the house you enter. - Are you sure? This whole issue is getting complicated and I'm no longer finding it funny. I'm getting fed up, Baba. Damn it! Don't say that anymore. The matter is getting resolved and here you are raising dust. We must act fast. Baba, I hope we'll get solutions upon getting to that house. And my daughter will be free to live her life? Don't take us back anymore. There shall be solutions once we get there. Salako! Is this not female's perfume? Yet he insists he doesn't cheat. Is this not female's perfume? Ah-ah! -Salako, -Mm? - What have I done to you? - What happened? That you treat me anyhow! I always try to get you in the mood, "Let's make out, baby come." Yet you keep complaining of tiredness. Meanwhile, you keep giving yourself to young girls out there. That's not nice. What are you insinuating this morning, for God's sake? But you know I was tired yesterday and I'm treating malaria. You are treating malaria and your cloth smells of a female perfume! My creator will judge you! ‪-That's not nice! ‪-May your creator judge me if I cheat on you. Okay? You better give yourself peace of mind. "A woman's perfume. A woman's powder. This, that." ‪Calm down. Don't think about it. Okay? What I thought you would mind, you don't mind. Give yourself peace of mind. That's how you do. You always pacify me. You keep using your magical voice on me. Look here, everything you do in secret shall be exposed. ‪-Amen! ‪-Everything evil will come to light. Amen. That's if I've got a secret. Madam, we're traveling. Let's get ready. Mm? If I get angry, I'll not travel with you. ‪Mama the mama! ‪Amotekun‪ general! Just get ready for the journey. Ay! Female's perfume. ‪This man! You'll just be bamboozling me. - It's here. Yes, here. - Here? He says it's here. Who is it? Google, it's me. Open. - How are you? - Good day. Is she okay now? Shut your mouth! Don't you have sense?! Is your boss at home? - He is not at home. He has travelled. - Ah! When will he return? - That should be next week. - Ah! - Next week? - Yes. It's very important that we see your boss. I've brought my people to see him. Didn't you hear what I said? I said he had travelled. He's not at home. - Are you sure? - Mm-mm. I'm not sure but doing guesswork. - Ah. - Take it easy. Are you sure your boss will be back by weekend? Yes. Are you sure? Yes sir. You can leave. Do you understand? My people, let's go. We shall sort things out when we get home. Hope you understand. Dad, your car key is with me. You will still be the one to take us back. But you asked me to leave. C'mon let's go. Are you mad? Hello Johnson! Hello? Johnson, where are you? I have been sitting here for a long time. Johnson, take it easy. You don't react to a situation the way it appears. You can't kill yourself over this matter. But wait, how many barrels are you on now? Johnson, I've told you to take things easy. You have to resolve issues step by step. There is a problem and there is nothing you can do about it. Let it be a step at a time. Ah-ah! Don't kill yourself. Just tell me where you are so I can join you. God, please have mercy on me. A happy home has now turned to a sorrowful home. They said they saw me outside at midnight. Me?! Bimpe! I don't understand. I don't stay up till 10:00 p.m. outside. I'm indoors anytime after 10:00 p.m. What is going on? God, if I am suffering the consequence of my sin, why don't you forgive me? Forgive me and have mercy on me. The DNA tests also reveal that my husband is not the biological father of my children. Our children! How? Oh Lord, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me. Deliver me from all these troubles. - At least, I spoke to you in the office. - Ha! I'm not worried. I just wanted to wait for you, so we could keep each other company. Babe, I can see it in your face. You're not okay. How can I be okay? Huh? I can't be okay with all that's going on. I'm always afraid to go home these days because I don't know the attitude Johnson will put up. I'm so scared. I don't know. I don't know what to expect. At least, it's only towards you that he changed his attitude. He has not changed towards the children. He's still relating with them as he had been doing. But, if things continue like this, how will the children not know? How will he not change towards the children? I don't know, I am just confused. Hope you have done all that the pastor asked you to do, ‪because everything will be okay. - I've done everything. I pray. - It'll be fine. But, I don't understand what you are saying. You said somebody entered our compound sleep walking. Ah-ah! I don't think that's possible. Because nobody can just enter my compound anyhow. Besides, I have a security guard. So, that is an impossibility. Honey, have you ever seen anybody enter the compound at midnight? How would I know if somebody enters the compound at midnight? This may not be the correct address you're looking for. Because this is confusing. I don't understand. Man, it's with you I've got words. Can you recognize this lady? - Huh! - I don't know her. But there's something vaguely familiar about her. - Does she live around here? - Young man, take it easy. There is a question I want to ask you. Has your wife given birth? We're still trusting God. ‪You're still trusting God. The oracle will cause you to have your own baby. - Amen. - You shall also carry your baby. ‪Many children will surround you. A banana ‪tree at a riverside must bear fruits. - You will carry your baby. - Amen! My people, it's time to go home. I have got the information I need. Though we'll still need to come back. - Let's go. - Ah-ah! This is very confusing. You came here to say somebody enters this compound, which we are yet to verify and you said you wanted to leave. What is really going on, please? Leave that. It's not time for that now. When it's time, we all shall get to know about the matter. - Let's go. - C'mon. Excuse me, where are you going? Do you want to follow them? Do you know where they're going? Do you want to play pranks on me? Honey, I don't understand. Why would they ask you if you recognized that lady? Did you know her before now? We both saw them as they got here. The way it caught you unawares was the way it caught me unawares. When they got here, I introduced you as my wife. And then what?! Does introducing me mean anything? Look here, don't play pranks on me. I know what you are doing. I may pretend as if I know nothing but I do. Of all houses, why was it our apartment that they came? You said she looked vaguely familiar. Is she your business partner? Or does she play golf with you? ‪All the golf items are inside the house. So you are leaving?! Honey? Ha! Look here, all secrets shall be exposed and I'll get to know. I will show you. I knew it. I knew you can't just be. This is what I've been searching for. Honey! So, you are leaving me. Google! Where is this idiot? Google! Ma'am! You heard me but refused to answer. Are you okay? Look here, it seems your eyes don't see well. It seems your glasses need an upgrade. Eh? Did you see the visitors that came here this morning? - Yes ma'am. - You see, next time I must not see them in this house. If peradventure they trespass, then you will face the music. If they call you in Nigeria, you'll respond in Afghanistan. You better let me know if you're the one to harbor evil for me. Not me oh. If they give you shawarma, you'll be saying rubbish. You always give me pizza. So I don't care about shawarma. - You'd better not. - Yes ma'am. - I must not see them here. - Yes ma'am. Idiot! He behaves irrationally. ‪If you have control, ‪will they have entered at all?! Such a narrowminded idiot! ‪I want you to take me ‪on a journey to know what is behind this. ‪Alayida oh! Alapada! Ogodo! Alayida ‪the father of Ano! Alapada, father of Oga! ‪Ogodo the father of Ogu, ‪don't deny me the vision of what happened. What sort of thing is this? This is a covenant. Thank you. I really appreciate for shedding light on this matter. ‪Gods in every land, I thank you. ‪Gods at the T junction of ‪Agbansaala, ‪Thank you. I give thanks! ‪Thank you for saving me. On your matter, when I looked intently, I saw that you undid yourself... This man and this woman were lovers in their first world. But you both were not able to make a decision of your heart desires till you left that world. You loved each other so much. Hence you made a covenant. You forgot this covenant you made when you come to the world this time. So you married someone else. She married someone else too. That's why there is no child between you and your wife. - And between you and your husband. - Hmm. Because you promised never to leave each other ever! But what happened is that I truly have a dream, ‪and this dream is frequent. I dream that a lady and I often have sex ‪and, such that I will be satisfied. After that I will find it very difficult to touch my wife. - This is serious! - You are correct. There's no lie in what you said. The dream you said you had often is not a mere dream. - It's a vision. Yes. - Mm-hmm? Her spirit at that time of the dream and his spirit will be having intercourse, such that either party will find it hard to enjoy his or her partner sexually. The children that this man thinks he got from this woman are not his. They are for this man. Baba, please don't say that. What is this rubbish you are saying? I sat down here looking at you saying all those superstitions you have been talking about and the blatant lies you have been telling and mixing with folklore and folktales told to children... What exactly are you saying? Baba, don't just tell me that! Don't let me disrespect you! As I sat here like a gentle lady, ‪look, it's not what you think! Don't try me! ‪I'm in trouble! The calabash may be small but the oracle is big. Let me clarify the issue. It cannot be possible. It's not scientifically possible. ‪There's nothing impossible. Someone I don't know from Adam... that I'm the biological father of her children. It's sleepwalking. Mr. Salako, let's be patient about this matter so we can get to the root of it. I as a person didn't believe until I heard about it. And I asked myself what sort of thing is this? How can this kind of thing happen? But when it was explained, I thought about it back and forth it began to make sense. We needed to travel because we wanted to relocate. We ran a series of tests as part of the requirements to travel and a DNA test was conducted. So at the hospital, the tests revealed that the children she had for me, who call me Daddy for years, who make me happy when I'm sad... They are not mine. ‪Ajani. ‪Something that... I want to suggest that you run a paternity test too. To see if indeed the children are yours or not. If not, we'll get to the root of this matter. I don't know. Can pregnancy be passed through the air waves like the Radio Frequency? Or can it be texted to someone? What kind of thing is this? ‪Honey don't you even... You better keep your mouth shut! Salako, don't let me disregard you! You know I have been telling you... You know I have always told you that you are way too gentle! It's as if you want to swindle me. So you have children out of wedlock. So you want to stylishly bring them home... through the window, right? Look, It's impossible! Let me tell you, that paternity test you were asked to do, you will do it! And let me tell you, Let me just tell you, see, if the DNA results are positive, ‪and those children ‪are confirmed yours, ah... Salako... you will conduct a funeral. Honestly, you will conduct a funeral. Because I will kill myself in your name. I'm telling you the honest truth. - Do you now see? - Yes, I do. That paternity test, you will do it! Ah! Don't try me oh! It's as if you don't know what you're doing at all. You don't know me at all. Madam, please take it easy. See, you ought to be really angry But if we are to mete out appropriate punishment, we'll over do it. So, please take it easy. ‪My dear, take it easy. ‪In the Name of God, take it easy please. About your issue, when I checked, you're responsible for what is happening to you. ‪-I'm responsible? How? ‪-Yes. Can you remember you came here sometime ago and I told you to be patient? Were you patient? When you got home, you started over reacting and got really mad at her. As you were angry with her, her creator was angry with you. If you can remember very well, the very day you laid your hands on her and beat her, things went bad for you in every way. It's not what you think sir. I was dead drunk. I was high that night. I was drunk and angry. I didn't know what I was doing. It's not like I just wanted to do that. ‪Can you hear yourself? Or can you see that? Look, let me tell you right away, you had better right your wrong. That is why I brought you here to Baba. Because as you get contract awards and lose it, things may get worse that's why I brought you here quickly. So you had better go quickly and beg her, prostrating, rolling on the floor, quickly apologize to her so that things can come back to normal. I don't like problems oh. And I warned him! - Can you see this man now? - Leave him. ‪-I pity you. ‪-Argh. You better act fast and get her to forgive you wholeheartedly The oracle says, ‪Ifa thought he could give life, ‪Ogun also thought he could. ‪Sango is more powerful than Ogun. ‪There was an inquiry ‪on who is the most powerful. ‪Sango expects that he's the most powerful. ‪But he's not. It's the woman who is ‪most powerful because she gives life. You'd better plead with the woman because a woman gave birth to you. If you do so and she forgives you wholeheartedly, everything will return to normal. - Hope you heard that? - I've heard you. - Hope you heard that? Good. - I've heard you. ‪So how about the medical test? ‪We have done it. ‪We're going for the results tomorrow. ‪Good! Let me know the outcome. ‪We'll know the next step to take. - Thanks for being there always. - You're welcome. God will keep helping you. You will do things with ease. Already settled matters are what will be brought to you to settle. ‪-Amen! ‪-Thanks so much. C'mon, let's go home. Bimpe please forgive me, I know I have hurt you but it's not my wish to hurt you. But no one will hear of such and not be angry and be full of sorrow. I am so sorry. I know I have wronged you. ‪Please forgive me. Forgive me. I'm sorry. Okay? Get up. No, I'm okay this way. Get up and sit down. I said come and sit down. Johnson, you really hurt me. ‪I'm sorry. You really hurt me. Because... what happened... is quite serious... and incredible. It's beyond human understanding... It seemed like a mystery to me. What hurt me most was that you slapped me in front of our maid. It really pained me. It really pained me to the marrow. I'm sorry. ‪It pained me. I know I misbehaved by doing that. I could not control my anger then. I'm sorry. I greet you all. Welcome. Since the tests have shown that the children borne by Adebimpe are for Salako, ‪Listen to me. We enquired from Ifa and Ifa goes further to explain what we will do to separate you both and free you from the covenant you made in your first world, that evil may leave you both. That you may live a life of peace. - That's the explanation I have to make. - Eh! I heard you sir. Er, the matter is getting clearer now. But the children are closer to their family than mine. So I don't have anything to contest about on that matter. But please let the oracle give us our own children too. Yes, you'll bear your own children. When you have broken the covenant between you, you will have your own children. When you have intercourse with your wife she will get pregnant. When he too sleeps with his wife, she will get pregnant. ‪Many children will surround you. A banana tree at a riverside must bear fruits. - Amen! - Thank you. Thanks Baba. Well-done. I have taken fate. What will be will be. ‪-What has been ordained must come to pass. ‪-That's true. You have said when you have done what ought to be done, the children will come. So how do we go about it quickly so that the covenant is broken? ‪When the time is ripe, ‪there's no more delay. Tomorrow evening, let Johnson and his wife come as well as Salako and his wife. And I assure you that the two families will carry their own children. The oracle has said it. ‪It's only happiness ‪that we expect from Orunmila. ‪The day that Orunmila met happiness, ‪and asked, "What about us?" ‪Joy will not cease in your home. ‪Children will not cease in your home. Congratulations! Enter into joy, prosperity and fruitfulness. - Thank you sir. - Thank you sir. Salako, don't tell me that oh. I won't take it at all. ‪What exactly are you saying? You want me to follow you there. I should follow you to where? So you can brainwash me. Right? And bring in the children through the backdoor. It won't happen. Because I will not allow it. It is not going to happen. ‪Please let go. This is a small matter. Don't escalate it. Whatever happened, happened in the spiritual. - I don't have anything to do with her. - Mm. Meanwhile, which children do I want to pick? They who have plans to go to Canada. So I will start carrying children about. No it won't work. See, let me tell you something... The most important thing is for us to go for the rites this evening. So at the end of day we can have our baby. Or don't you want us have our own child? How can you say that?! How can you say that?! You know all I have done for us to have a child. - Don't say that. - It's true. ‪I even... - In fact... - I'm sorry. Let's just go there and do what we need to do. I didn't say I'm not going with you. I didn't say that but, - I have a condition. - Okay. What? You will sign an undertaking... that you are not bringing any child into this house. I don't want it. That's fine. Will you go and get a lawyer? No need. I have prepared my documents already. - Documents? - I know you very well. You mean it. You have prepared the documents? - Yes, I have. - Oh, wow! ‪Okay. ‪Here we go. Women! Mm. ‪Okay. It is done. Let me double check to be sure that it's your real signature. - Yes, it is. - I have crosschecked. I will go and keep it safe where you will not go and change it later. -Please don't follow me -Okay. so you won't know where I will keep it. So get up, both of you. This is the last stage. So get up, both of you. ‪I've pleaded with the masquerades ‪and the gods of the market. ‪I've pleaded with the invincible chiefs. - Both of you will have children with ease. - Amen! ‪Your joy will be full. ‪When you eat, you will not vomit, ‪When you swallow, it won't choke you. ‪The most powerful ‪-will not let calamity fall upon you. ‪-Amen! ‪So now, when you get home, get intimate with your wife and you with your husband, - you will surely conceive. - Amen! ‪I am very sure that you'll have children. ‪-Baba, thank you. ‪-Well done. I don't like bragging, but I want to assure you that I will surprise you. Because this childlessness has really given us a lot of problems. - But, I'll surprise you. - Well done. I am sure that you will come back with thanks. ‪You will thank the diviner. ‪The diviner will thank the oracle. ‪The oracle will thank ‪Orunmila. ‪Orunmila will thank ‪Eledumare‪ for you. We shall not be put to shame. Well done, You will bear your own children. You'll have a baby. ‪Alayida oh! Alapada! Ogodo! Alayida ‪the father of Ano! Alapada, father of Oga! ‪Ogodo the father of Ogu, ‪don't let them lack children! ‪Subtitle Translation by: Regina Njoku
