The three-fold law. Boomerang effect. Karma. What we put out into the world will be returned to us. And when everything is balanced,... ...all things will be as they were. Then what's left of us? But you're never around. When was the last time you're home? You never even told me where you are. I was working, Isma. I was working! You think I was just playing around in the States? So everything is my fault then? Taking care of our son and doing housework... ...it's not easy, especially with my illness. Enough! Your condition has nothing to do with this. Hey, Deon! Deon, wait! Deon! Deon? Deon! Two years later. I went to London, Amsterdam, as usual. Nothing special. -Deon. I can't find the potion. How do I find it? Where? Bali? Jogja? There's a lot of options. Deon, Deon! What? Watch me, I'm going take on the boss. Die, die. Dad, need monthly allowance, asap. Hey, there are two paths. Go right, maybe? Deon: When are you coming home? Dad: Why don't you stay with your mother this week? She missed you. They are swarming in. Oh no, they broke the window. I died. Deon. Deon! I'm dead now. I have to start from the check point again. Your game is outdated. -You're all talk. But Deon seems cool. Deon? I'm obviously better than him. You only judge from his looks. Deon is messed up inside. Is it the rumour about his parents? Exactly. His father was never around,... ...and his mother is always sick. So she couldn't do much for him. Just ignore him. Then, his mother had an affair. -Deon. After the divorce, his father was..... Here, look. Deon, just ignore him. Deon! -His father was never..... Chill out, bro. Wow, you're crazy. Tika! Hey, Tika! Tika! Hey, Tika! Tika, go get the teacher! It's the second time this week you and Gani have a fight. Last month you had a fight with Jaka. The month before that you hit Fauzan. Do you want to get expelled from school? I don't get you. You have never caused any trouble before. If you have any issue,... ...there's a lot of people here that you can talk to. When's your father coming home? Have your guardian sign this. But remember, this is your last warning. You must apologize to Gani now. Before you head back to class. -What? I'm not going to do it. You dare talking back at me? This is not a choice. Let's go. I'll take you there. I want to hear your apology to Gani. Come. Nurse, how is he? It seems there are only scratches. But the cut may be a bit deep. Gani, this is Miss Eva and Deon. Deon wants to apologize to you. Deon, go ahead. Gan, she told me to apologize. Say it properly. Gani, Gani, what's wrong? Gani! Gani! Gani, stop! Deon, get out now! Gani, stop! Deon, now! Gani! Stop it! Stop it! Sir. I saw Gani in the infirmary, he..... He bit the nurse's neck. Enough, enough. Sir, I'm not joking. I really saw Gani bite her neck. Sit down. -Sir, I'm telling the truth. Sit down! Go ahead. -Come on, sit. Sit down. How was it? I'd like to have your attention. The school management received some news from the government. They informed us that all institution... ...must be closed for the remaining day. Including all workers and employees. Rumour is, there was an increase of infectious disease... ...caused by contaminated floodwater. It could be fatal to your health. And be sure to head back home right away. Understood? -Yes, sir. Have a good day. What's up with you? Are you still afraid of Miss Eva? Let's leave now. Hold on. Where are you heading back? You're going to be alone at home... ...and your mother will be alone in her apartment, too. What are you trying to say? You want to hitch a ride? Why did you bring my mother up? I mean... ...I just feel bad that your mother... ...being left alone and she is sick. Don't you think you should stay with her? That way we'll go in the same direction. So I can get a ride, and you can drop me off at..... From now on, you go home by yourself. I'm not going to give you a lift anymore. Come on, don't be like this. I didn't mean it like that. Go ahead, leave. Where are you? Niko, stay there. Me? -Stay right there. What? -Niko, stay right there. Oh, I can hitch a ride? For real? -No, stay there. What are you doing here? Everyone's already out. I want to get my mom. Are you sure she is still inside? Sorry, I can't help you. But you can take this with you. Hey! Aim for the head! Wait, wait. I also need that gun. And can't you wait for me? It will only take five minutes. Three minutes. And no guns for you. Come on. Go, go, go! Mom, open the door! Mom! Mom, open the door! Deon? -Mom! Mom! Mom, open it! Mom! Open the door! Yes, I'm coming. Are you alright, Deon? Why were you running? Your shirt..... Behind me, you can see a crowded street,... ...full of civilians running in panic... ...leaving their vehicles behind... ...and rushing into the military trucks. It was said that the suburbs in Jakarta... ...have been swarmed with the infected. For the time being, all survivors in other areas... ...are advised to quarantine... ...those who were bitten by the undead... ...and to lock the doors until the rescue team arrive. We were informed that the government... ...has been trying to contact other countries... ...for military support. Naegleria roszeta. This water protozoa have evolved in order... ...to survive the harsh environment. And once it enters the bloodstream... ...it will transform from cyst to trophozoite stage. And will grow thousand times bigger from its original size. In its adult stage, this parasite... ...can manipulate and control the brain. It breed by spreading the nucleus through the host's saliva. Dr. Ross. I see two different parasites. What do you know about these two? It comes from the same amoeba, Colonel. But this one... ...failed to reach its adult stage. That's because, on its journey to the brain... ...it failed to eat more than fifty of its own kind. Generals. Luckily... ...we've exchanged information with a guerilla group. It seems that we have to... ...meet them so we can discuss the best strategy. But Colonel... ...for the serum. I think the first serum has failed. The side effects were too harmful. As for the second serum,... ...I haven't tested it. However small the chance is,... ...we'll take that risk. Where is this serum located? Swarmed with the infected. We were informed that the government has been trying... ...to contact other countries for military support. Why did you turn on the TV? The noise can attract those things outside. Sorry, Deon. I was going to turn it off. I tried pressing the button but it won't turn off. Of course you can't. The on off button is... ...the red one, not that button. Why are there two remotes? Mom, that one is for DVD, this one is for TV. I did turn it on with this one. I forgot. Here. -What, mom? Enough, mom. Don't watch the TV anymore. Mom! Did you go out? Yes. It's in my schedule to take out the trash... ...every evening, Deon. Mom, what if the undead saw you? I'm sorry, Deon. I've checked the corridor and it was empty. Enough, mom. Just don't go out anymore, get it? Yes, alright. Help! We're still alive! When will the rescue team arrive? The light's back. It's not here. I'm sure I took it out from your bag. Did I? I'm sure I did. Deon, I'm sorry. What now, mom? I mistakenly threw away the bread you bought. Seriously? -Yes. But we should still have some food. Mom! Even with the bread, we still don't have enough food. Maybe..... Maybe my nurse have some... ...more food for us. Your nurse? Yes. Nurse Ida. She's always come to check for my needs in the morning. She lives on the third floor. On that hallway..... Deon, what are you doing? Deon, you..... I need your pins. Oh, okay. Don't kill him! Don't kill him! He will not attack you. I saw someone put a sign on the seventh floor. Are you coming? You're the one putting up the sign? Yes. Listen up. We will make a stop to discuss the best strategy. But our main mission is to get the Zeta serum... ...in an apartment, south from here. We will not stop to help any civilians. Including children, women, or wounded citizens. We will go straight until we reach our destination. Understood? -Yes! Colonel. -Yes? If I may speak, I think it's faster if we go by helicopter. We don't have enough helicopter in this base. All units were dispatched to transport government officials. But this is a good chance for us to see the damage in the city. But is your team trained to fight monsters like Zeta? They are trained to die, Dr. Ross. That's what matters. I'm Deon. This is my mother. Call me Bu Isma. I'm Reza. Where's that water from? Oh, from the dispenser. Don't worry, I was a nurse once. Sorry, it's going to hurt a little. That radio, is it working? For what? -To contact the military team. It's going to hurt a little. Sorry. No, it can't. It's only for contacting Reyhan. My brother. He lives in tower two. I was..... -It may hurt a bit, Reza. Just for a bit. The door to the stairs and basement were full of Alpha Zeta,... ...so I had to run here. Alpha Zeta? The undead with bright red eyes. Remember the three undead standing still on the corridor? Their eyes are normal coloured. They are called Omega Zeta. If you look closely... ...Alpha Zeta always attack first. Omega Zeta follows. Finished, ma'am? -Done. Thank you, ma'am. I'm sorry for troubling you. Don't mention it. We have to help each other. Drink up. Thank you. -You're welcome. What's your plan now? Well, I still have to go to Reyhan's. He said his friends are coming to pick us tonight. Then why were you outside? I don't live with him. I rent my own place. How come there's a drink already? Who put the drink here, Deon? You did, mom. It's fine, we had one already. It's fine, thank you, mom. It's okay, you can put it back. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Your mother..... -Alzheimer. Can't remember the things she just did. She often forget how to do basic things. I think it would be safer if... ...all of us gather in Reyhan's place. He has a radio that can contact the rescue team. Sure, there's no use in waiting here anyway. But... ...my brother... ...is a bit stubborn. It's fine. I've gathered everything... ...that can be used as a weapon. Okay. I will tell Reyhan now. How's Nurse Ida doing? Is her family okay? The world is in chaos. No one will survive. Don't say that. We are fine, right? Nurse Ida is a good person. When you and dad left me... ...Nurse Ida was the only one supporting me. Left you? Whose fault was it? -I'm sorry, Deon. Think first before you speak. Don't upset anyone. -Yes, yes. Sorry, Deon, I'm sorry. I'll just go clean up. It's back on. Her family are all dead. What? Nurse Ida's family were all dead. But Nurse Ida wasn't there. Maybe she got out safely. You ready? Once I open this door,... ...you run straight to the elevator. I'm going to open the door now. Are you ready? Hey, are you ready? Yes. Come on. Mom. Deon! Deon! Deon! Deon, what was that? Mom, come on. Mom. Mom, quickly. Mom, come here. Reza, where are you? Deon? Deon. Deon. Call your mother now. Mom, come here. Mom, what did you do? Why weren't they attacking? I don't know. -Come, we have to hurry. His apartment is on the fifth floor. This is the asset you mentioned? Hey, they're here to borrow the radio. We can make deals with them..... -What are you going to do to her? Deon! Mom! Mom! Deon! Deon! Deon, open the door! Deon! Deon! Deon! Deon! Open the door, Deon! Deon! Deon. Are you okay? You were too harsh. -I don't care. I need those stuff. Blue River will still pick us up without those stuff. What do you think those are? It's not easy to gather that many. We don't need to use violence for..... You talk too much! You're not the one working for it. I am! You scum! How dare you lie to me. You brat. Sit down. Sit! Reza didn't lie to you. He's right. I have the radio. It's inside the closet. Here's the key. You are welcome to use it. But on one condition. What do you want now? I want your mother... ...to get some stuff in my car, outside the lobby. Why don't you use all these weapons yourself? Do you really want to use my radio? Am I going alone? Mom. Unless you want your son to turn into Zeta, he may go. I don't get what you're thinking, but my mom is..... I hate small talks. Bravo, contact. Left side, two zombies. Shoot! Alpha, contact. Two zombies, left and right. Shoot! The head. Aim for the head. Bravo, watch out. Zombie, in the car. Zombie! On the left and right. Contact. Hold. Delta One, secure the area. Roger, on it. Delta Two, go, go, go. Go! The Blue River group. These people believed that one day the undead will rise. They have been trained for this day. In a normal world,... ...they are labelled as society's garbage. Maya. Colonel. Meet Dr. Richard Ross. After you. The scientist who discovered the Zeta serum in Indonesia. Dr. Ross. You may not remember,... ...but we have met before in Talas village. When the River Detoxification project was executed. So you have been preparing yourself since then? That's right, Colonel. After college, I formed the Blue River group right away. Yes, I have to admit, we don't have a lot of members. And to tell you the truth,... ...we've been wanting to kick out one rebellious member. So we are thankful... ...for the ammunition support that you gave us. Because the person we are going to expel... ...is our usual source of ammunition supply. We called the undead with red eyes as Alpha Zeta. And the one with normal coloured eyes as Omega Zeta. Yes, I'm aware of their life cycle. But I have never seen one alive. Alpha Zeta. It has three more tentacles. Two penetrates deeply on occipital lobe. Which most likely changed the host's eye colour. But what does the one on the prefrontal cortex do? Decision making. I think it alters their decision making. That's the reason why Alpha Zeta... ...act like the leader of Omega Zeta. From our analysis... ...Alpha Zeta are more aggressive. And can jump when attacking the target. They will not attack people who are sick? We are unsure about that one. But earlier today, Ario was not attacked at all. So we think Zeta will not attack those who has brain damage. Yes. They are able to see human who has a healthy brain. Colonel. -Yes. We also wrote down some strategies that we have tried. Misdirection using sound. Okay. Thank you. Give one radio to her. You stay on the stairs. Hold this button if you want to speak. I will keep you safe from here. Kill all the Alpha Zeta in the lobby. For what? Just do it! I want to test something out. There's a black van outside the lobby. The van is not locked. You will find two bags inside. Bring the bags and pass it to Reza. Tell her to go back. Get the other bag. Nurse. All Alpha Zeta in the lobby are clear. Face-eating thief arrested. Cannibal incident in Talas Village. I have to try some frequency to reach the military. I'm going to get my mother. What did you say? I'm going to get my mother. I don't think your mother is still..... I am going to get my mother! I saw her running to the side of the building. She is probably in the basement now. Take this. I will guide you from here. Mom! Mom! Mom? Wake up, mom. Mom, wake up. Mom. Mom, wake up. Mom. Mom, this is Deon. This is Deon, mom. Deon? Yeah. I'm sorry, dear. No, mom. It's alright. I'm going to leave you again. No, mom. Don't leave me. I'm sorry, dear. I always give you what you don't like. Here. I'm happy when you were wearing it. I made it when you were born. Mom. Happy birthday, dear. Mom, I'm sorry. It's all my fault, mom. It's my fault. Mom? Mom, wake up. Mom, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, don't leave me. Deon, I've reached the military team. How is your mother's condition? Reza, ask them. How long until my mother's turned? The longest is ten minutes. Sorry, Deon. Don't leave me, mom. I'm sorry. I love you, mom. Mom? Mom. Mom. Mom? Mom? Reza? Reza, ask them again. My mom didn't change. Her eyes..... Military base five, come in. Military base five, standby. With whom am I speaking to? Over. It's Reza again. I need more information. My friend who was infected earlier,... ...still hasn't turned into undead. Even though it has been half an hour... ...and her eyes have turned red. Could she be saved? Over. Pardon me, but where is your location? Over. My location? I'm in Teratai Asri Apartment. Sir, I need this information to help my friend. Over. If I may ask, did she ever consume some medications? Over. I'm not sure. What kind of medications you speak of? Military base five, come in. Military base five, come in. Pardon me, but is she familiar... ...with the name Dr. Richard Ross? Over. It's best for us to maintain contact until all this is over. Certainly, Colonel. A report, Colonel. There's news from military base five. There was a call from a victim on our target location. The victim confirmed that they are related to Dr. Richard Ross. Deon? This is a good chance for us. If he is Deon Ross... ...tell him to get the document of the Zeta serum. And tell him that a rescue team will pick him up. Roger. Mom. Mom. Where is father's document? Father's document. His old files. Father's document. Mom. Father's document. It's in..... Mom. Mom. Father's document. In my..... In my room. Inside the drawer. In your room, in the drawer. Wait for me here. Okay? Ario is not coming. I have contacted the military team. Sorry. I had to side with Deon. You were out of line. What? Deon went after her mother. Once they are back... ...the military will pick us up. You are coming with us. This is the best for everyone, Rey. For you as well. What did you say? Deon? Where is he? If not for me, you'd be dead at the orphanage. You scum! I'll kill him. River Detoxification program..... My wife agreed to be the test subject. April 2001, our son was born. Deon, where are you? Reyhan is coming after your mother. You have to go now. Open the door! Open it! Brat, come out. Where are you? You brat. Stop hiding! Deon? What do you want from her? Let her go! -Deon. You two are unique. Show yourself. Show yourself now! Show yourself now... ...or I'll shoot your mother's head. Hands up. Throw away your weapon. Throw it far from you, you scum! I did what you wanted. Now let her go. Before you speak... ...use your brain. All this... ...is happening because of you. Before you came... ...I was free from all these Zeta. On top of that... ...you could not get all of my stuff. If you could behave earlier... ...you both would still be okay now, right? Answer me! Can't you speak? Mom! Now you die in my hands. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Delta One, clear. Chief, move. No, no, no. No, no. No, Deon! Secure the target. You, get down on your knees. Don't get up right away, you will get dizzy. How are you feeling? Where is this? This is military base five. You've been here for three days. Wait here, I'll go get your friend. Dr. Ross will make a serum from his blood. Deon. Yes? His name is Deon. With all due respect, sir,... ...I don't know him that well. But I disagree if we have to keep drawing his blood. I understand your concern. Like I said earlier... ...all of us, including you... ...have to watch his health. Since the serum can only be made using his blood. Deon. Hey. I'm so sorry, Deon. I wasn't there for you. I..... I could not save your mother. I'm sorry. You had to go through it alone. I came as soon as I heard about... ...the Zeta outbreak in this country. But I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I couldn't come sooner. I love you, Deon. I love you. I won't leave you again. I promise.
