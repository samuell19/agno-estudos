Hungry Hill Subtitles by Seglora And how do you like the place for your new mine,Mr Brodrick? Who told you anything about a new mine? The sharers might have been it,Mr Brodrick There's no harm in anyone knowing of it now I'm going to sink a copper mine in Hungry Hill,these are the plans You've been having no great advantages from it That'll we shall found out I'm not talking about the fortune you'll make,the copper will do that for you I'm thinking of the trouble and sorrow it will bring to you and yours That shall we also find out You should have asked permission of the heir itself Ah,you can laugh,Mr Brodrick,you and your Trinity College Education and your big pushing ways but I tell you now when your mine will I ruined and your house destroyed Hungry Hill will still be standing there to confront you I've no time for arguing with you,Morty Donovan If you and your son would care to do an honest day's work for change I will be glad to employ you I've never worked for any Master,nor have my sons and never will while I live Doesn't this land belongs to us by rights? These ancient quarrels are best forgotten All right young Tim,they paid him out Morty Donovan Yes,the land belongs to us by rights and the copper in it too if we remind you'll take it Be careful my child,you'll nearly pushed me over Barbara Hello Father Any luck today,Henry Just a grouse,will you kind of sell us the news ,Father Later,you might hand me those papers will you ,dear? Is this your secret? I'll carry them Now you'd better give them to me Everything in good time Young Tim Now then young Tim,do you know anything? What devil of things has changed? -Sure no? -It's the holy truth,Miss Jane But I'll tell you,there's trouble again with them Donovans The secret father,you promised to tell us Yes all in good time,my child I had hoped we'd might all be together but it appears that John has no more manners than a country lad and no thought in his head but for dogs and horses However I won't keep you waiting any longer because of him Today you would be pleased to know that I I'm sorry to be so late father You'd better ring for Timothy I've already seen him father Father you were telling us Before you came in,John, I was about to tell them of my new project The copper mine on Hungry Hill? Who told you about a mine? I heard it in the village -A mine? On Hungry Hill? -You will become very rich What about the labour and machinery? One at the time,one at the time Machinery is on the way over,Henry and I arranged to bring over Cornish miners to begin with I expect resentment from the people here,they resent any form of progress But when they see fat wages you pay to the Cornish men there they'll come running to you for employment I wonder You wonder what John? I don't quite know,Sir they may come to you for employment but they will be very bitter about it You care to sympathize with them? At least I think I understand them You see they look upon us as interlopers People who'd made money out of them and hope make much more Fair and honestly by working harder than others I know,Sir, but they still look on us as outsiders Nonsense,there have been Brodricks here for 200 years And Donovan's owned Clonmere and Hungry Hill itself for centuries until they were dispossessed, they feel it is still theirs by right that's why they distrust us while they work at the mine if they must but do everything they can to make it fail Since you so much about these people perhaps you can tell me why they lack initiative? And the sense of responsibility that could make this country both great and rich Perhaps,Sir,they have no desire to see their country great or rich Then what do they want? Speaking for myself,Sir,I'd say they desire nothing so much to be left alone Henry,will you come with me to the library? Yes,father There's disagreement again There's the poor Master John again Poor Master John indeed,I heard him disputing away with his own father He hadn't enough beatings when he was younger Remind you to as many silver I won from his greyhounds And money you won you lost That was more ad-lib,the dear gentle soul There would be less trouble in this house and in the village too No if it gives Mr Brodrick any pleasure to be having a copper mine now that he's grown old and locked up in himself well then no one should deny him And is a mine he wants now? Sure it was copper we were meant to be having wouldn't be poured now with the Hill and Great Gordon stream down to our very door But Mother there were cheering to Mr John in the village today when "Lifewood" won -He is very well liked you know -Good Have you the boilers attended yet? No,no but it was just getting into my mind to do it This very minute I suppose I have to be doing it myself No,no,no with two men in the house never let it be said that you Listen,go on attend to the boiler at once will you? You can argue as much as you like,John But it's all your fault now if father is ill humoured for days -You would at least start complaining about -But I am You know how father dislikes any argument or talk about the Donovans Why does he do it? It isn't if we needed the money But I do But I know what you mean What are you looking at? The hill,you can't see it tonight though, moon hasn't risen high enough Of course you've never seen a mine John,darling,what is it you want for yourself? I wish I knew Not that Not chimneys,wheels,shafts and smoke and the end of everything green and beautiful -Well,Nicholson,it's getting better -Yes Sir,and it'll get better every day I'll have this analysed,father Copper John,look at him with his pack of foreigners,ripping up the whole countryside Before the winter is out,you'll find most of the villagers will be working up here I hope so,father I really do hope so It's a pick-nick we are preparing not a siege Miss Barbara The officers are all here,quickly,Barbara You mean Lieutenant Fox is here You look lovely my dear,you really do Timothy will you take us out the carriage horse I'll attend to it myself this very minute,Miss Barbara Oh boys oh boys,you here,young Tim Listen here is something for you throwing your strength on That should be Miss Fanny Rosa If I am any judge of commotion Well,your "Manners",you rule again Right John,I do declare you saved my life I thought I was saving the horses I thought you only handled greyhounds, horses are so wild My father always said that the man who could break a horse could win a woman But you wouldn't know about that I must ask your brother Henry Hello,how are you Henry Fanny Rosa how beautiful you look I saddled Ladybird for you,Mr John Thank you,Tim -Hello Fanny Rosa -Hello Don't go into the carriage,ride with me All right,Henry Don't fight Mr John there is a lot more fun in coursing greyhounds Mind your own business Aren't you coming in the carriage with us Fanny Rosa? No,I'm riding over with Henry Oh John since you are so good at racing greyhounds,let's see how you race horses If that Miss Fanny Rosa was a daughter of mine I'll put her across me knee and I'd mark her for life Did I disturb you,John? Yes,Fanny Rosa you did disturb me Then you always do Of course you could go on reading -And then I go on talking -I know Now you are angry with me Oh Rosa how can anyone be angry with you? We wanted to do that for moment time haven't you? For months I've thought of nothing else Why have you been so sorrow all day? -Nothing -Fanny Rosa! -John,where are you? -Listen I can hear Henry calling Do you like Henry very much? He is light hearted and gay Not solemn at all But you do like him? I like you both Come on Here it is then 40 pounds Sign your proper name this time now Not Guy Fawkes I didn't know the old man was back from England yet With the right look on him too And you wonder -(?) I'm thinking -And fairly soon I wish you sent word to me sooner,Nicholson However I think I know the source of the trouble and how to stop it,all right Tim Best vintage I have in the house we may be poor,Mr Brodrick,but we are not wanting in hospitality You may excuse me for not rising but my leg I didn't come here to drink your health,Donovan,or my own I came to tell you I'm fully aware of all mischief you're causing on Hungry Hill amongst the miners and I intend to stop it I don't understand such talk,Mr Brodrick I haven't been near Hungry Hill these three weeks with this poor leg of mine Whilst I've been away there has been a system of plunder going on at the mine and you know it Coppers been taken out each night in spite of a watch been placed on every shed and tram wagon Plunder? Why not ask your Cornish workmen,what they do with the stuff then? The Cornish men are innocent, you know that well enough and the Doom Haven men would have worked honestly enough but for the poison you spread behind my back Poison is it? Is it poison to call upon the saints to forgive you for working and sweating young children to make you your fortune? Or rather has my speech been filled with pity for you I want none of your pity but I've given you a fair warning and that's all I came for you can tell your friends in the future that they won't find it so easy to steal from me Good Day to you Mrs Donovan,Donovan I mean the men of Doom Haven do sell your copper on their own dear then it is yourself Copper John Brodrick that must bear the blame for putting the poor creatures in the way of temptation Save yourselves the trouble of asking your father why I came here I'd like to warn you as I warned your father keep your hands of my copper and yourselves of Hungry Hill,Good Afternoon All right you can go I still think father doesn't take these affairs seriously enough He's just out to catch a few men who are stealing copper But I think it all goes much deeper than that The people hate the mine I wouldn't trouble your pretty head about that things have been very quiet here for the last few weeks and John do come and sit down They are sure to be back soon Perhaps one of the horses went lame or something Perhaps There they are now I'm glad you're back we were getting anxious We lost our way that's all You seem to lose it rather often But never twice with the same man,John Come upstairs and change you mustn't catch a cold after a ride and you're going abroad tomorrow Henry -Come here at once -What's happened,father? The mine One of Nicholson's men shoot Terence Delaney while he was trying to get away with the copper Killed him? No,Dr Armstrong is with him now doing what he can Morty Donovan has called out the rest of the village and if they say their man dies they wreck the miner's houses I say,look! It started already those are the Cornish men's huts they set on fire Henry,you John and half the men go by the other road,come up the mine from the far side and the rest of us will set across the fields and see to the fires but hurry Here is Brian now father How is your poor father now Brian? He is dead Mr John Do you hear that boys,Terence Delaney is dead,they killed him,the mines it is You get up to the Counting House,we'll give the warning if they come this way Henry come over here will you Tim,you watch here Of course the cave we used to play there when we were children -I thought it had followed in -It had They must have cleared it away and got into the mine This is were the stolen copper has been taken out Mr Henry,Mr John where are you,Mr Henry Come on Well if it isn't Barney Recour -Why did you come in you fool you were -There are thousand men coming up the hill -Thousands? -Well,a hundred anyway You'd better go and warn Father No I go you stay here and stop anybody of getting in to the mine this way I go up by the shaft All right we'll try There,there Barney you'll be all right in the morning Remember Terence Delaney -There must be hundreds of them -And only thirty of us Down with the Brodricks Guard the forges and the Counting House we can't save the rest Fair enough,didn't I tell you Mr Brodrick that your mines would bring nothing but ruin and despair You'll get a little packet(?) for this night's work,Donovan,I promise you I know the men behind you A curse on you John Brodrick For all the wrongs you've done Nicholson the gunpowder stock get all men away make them lie down quickly Henry Lie down,Henry,lie down Lie down Henry You're Brodricks son,I curse you now,as I cursed your father Henry Henry I think all is quiet now,Sir Yes Is there anything at all I can do for you? No,there's nothing you can do for me Everything is quiet now Nevertheless Nicholson I'm convinced that these new machinery will give us at least a 30 % increase on our yields I hope so,Mr Brodrick -You are too conservative,Nicholson -Always have been Anyway the men are working well now no trouble at all and over 300 of them are back Mr Henry would have been pleased with these new methods I am sad he is not here to see them It is so And it is a pity that Mr John hasn't his interest in the mines Have you had any news of him lately,Mr Brodrick? Some of the men have been asking about him John is still in London learning to become a lawyer An uncommonly slow business it seems That young lad up there who looks like one of the Donovans who might he be? It is a Donovan.Michael Donovan It's a strange thing,Nicholson,I can get a Donovan to work at my mine,not a Brodrick Come in -Jane -Darling I'm so pleased to see you Darling Jane,now let me have a good look at you Yes,not bad,not bad at all -Almost pretty -Beast I'm belle at the County Cork Does it take long to become a lawyer? Oh,a very long time But what on earth are you doing here? Is that St Paul's? Yes,yes it is Anything else you'd like to know young lady? Yes What will you do with yourself when you are not becoming a lawyer? Watch other people race greyhounds But tell me what are you doing here? I said I could persuade you to come back and live at Clonmere and without another word father gave me fifty pounds to spend in London Fifty pounds I wish he'd give me five He misses you,John Though he never say so We all do Will you come back with me? No,Jane dear,I don't think so Why stay in London,father wants you at home Does he? I think you're mistaken, I think it is Henry he wants not me You're wrong,John And something more Fanny Rosa is back in Ireland Is she? And I suppose now that Henry is dead,she's prepared to have me back She managed to make a fool of me in the past She probably would have gained if she had the chance Oh no with Fanny Rosa in Ireland I stay here Hello Father Barbara Hello John Welcome home You'll need some good fresh air to get your colour back again -Come along inside -And he has lost weight I do declare Well,you could do a little more yourself,darling Brute -Ah,Bridget -God Bless you Master John -Welcome home,Master John -Thank you,Timothy I'd like the Footy William and Brian Baroue but he should been a pup still He's a great class of a dog with a powerful appetite and mind a fine courser Young Tim train them under my own watchful eye of course Get away (?) you never looked at the dog until today -Oh I missed you all -And we missed you too Sure why wouldn't he miss his Ireland he alone in England with that pack of foreigners Yes,he's all right Not a hard man at all I didn't think he'd stick so long down here at the mine Too soon to talk yet,he's only been working a couple of months Is "Lighter" up for the night,Sir? Yes,I think he'll win Your dog has doubled my wages for many a week,Sir Good Hello,Fanny Rosa -What brings you here? -You Aren't you pleased to see me after all these years? One year I thought you'd might like to take me coursing this afternoon No I've no time for that these days Well in that case I shall have to go over to the island There are some very charming officers there And I think it will be more pleasant than watching your old dogs I doubt that the officers are more charming than dogs and they are certainly not so pleasant to watch Tell me John do you go sailing any more on Sundays? I do not My father gave me a little boat for my birthday I was wishing someone would show me how to handle her she is painted blue she lies in the harbour at Andru She must enjoy that immensely If you hear of an accident on Sunday it would be me and my little boat being drowned together Fanny Rosa there are some twenty of your charming officers on Douan Island, you might get them to help you One at the time though because I doubt that there will be room for more in a boat of once The only one I fancy has gone away They say his wife sent him in a hurry Wasn't that more fun than that dreary old mine? Certainly more dangerous If I'd heard of an accident on Sunday it would be you drowning after all You're glad you came -Well -Sure you're glad It's been a very enjoyable afternoon Indeed you are too kind,Mr Brodrick What was it you wanted me to say? Only the truth nothing more,nothing less John,do you remember the day of the pick-nick? -I do -We were happy then,weren't we? Yes,and so was Henry Well I suppose I better put my boots on I love you (?) self Will you be giving me another sailing lesson? I'd rather you married me first Then I have the legal right to drown you I don't want to be married Wear a cap in the house like mother and talk about servants -You needn't of any of those things -And I want to travel Married people are allowed to travel Then I will be Mrs Brodrick and none of the men on the Continent will not take any notice of me I'm afraid they would When shall I see you again? I don't know I might not like you tomorrow You really shouldn't you know You simply raided(?) the cellar already Confounded can't I have a drink without everyone treating me like a confirmed drunkard Just because Fanny Rosa drives you to drink there is no need to take it out on me I often wished I could drink -You do? -Yes I do That young man Fox really deserves It's a pity you weren't at the mine today,John I had a very satisfactory talk with Nicholson I was out riding We are sinking a new shaft 180 fathoms east of the present one we know the copper is there and it's certainly worth the extra expenses for trying for it Don't you agree John? Oh,absolutely,Sir,splendid idea, I'm sorry,Sir,what was you saying It's very fortunate for you,John the (?) chance ,you heir to such considerable wealth for which you never make a slightest exertion yourself and apparently never will I refrain from saying anything hoping you come to realize your responsibilities But since this Fanny Rosa flower has returned your interest in the mine has become even less You are right,Sir, I am extremely fortunate to be your heir even through ill chance but I'm also grateful for all you done for me and grateful to Henry too and to Morty Donovan whose death through gunpowder made everything so much easier for us That you are drunk is obvious But it no excuses your unpardonable behaviour Pity we must always quarrel to you in dinner,the food gets cold It wasn't very funny was it? No I think you ought to go and apologize I'll go and see father has something to eat Don't trouble,dear, I'll go Jane,what's become of me these days I don't know ,my darling,you are not a very pleasant person Why couldn't it be me instead of Henry, father wouldn't have minded at all That's not true Yes it is,every day I can hear him thinking what a hopeless person he is compared with Henry I know he's right I always hated the mines Now I am beginning to hate even Clonmere itself It should have been Henry's by right I'm sure it is only about Clonmere that I felt like this There are times I could murder Fanny Rosa There are times when I could too Let us go and speak to Father Father I'm afraid I spoke rather hastily I very much regret if I said anything that offended you No,John,I'm not offended,I'm just disappointed somehow After Henry died I'd hoped that you and I might grow closer together But we haven't Although I don't think the fault lies entirely with me Perhaps you are right,Sir And I feel I must tell you that I hate intensely doing anything which I have no ability John, I can see no point in prolonging this conversation I'm glad you came in to apologize Good night to you Good night,Sir John How was it with Father? Oh,he was very forgiving That's wonderful No we are further apart than ever We only half understand each other Trouble is that neither of us will admit it That's not the trouble The trouble is you don't understand Fanny Rosa Go on,Jane As the mouse Come on Fanny Rosa will marry you the day she wants to And she won't want to until they day she thinks she can't One until the day you something to do to make her marry you Good Night Do I look pretty,Bridget? You do the courier(?) to make it There,you're just like your mother,she was pretty too Who is it? Fanny Rosa,open up quickly Why Fanny Rosa,you're always late I had a terrible day of it My mother set fire to her new gown and the dogs ate up the birthday present I had for John Oh Fanny Rosa it's wonderful Do you like it? -Yes -John didn't That's a sure sign every woman will Get on now all of you the music is starting already come on Miss Fanny Rosa,come on Jane I just been talking to mother(?) Dick what's she saying? We seemed to be in a rather hurry I don't suppose it was a very good time but I think everything is going to be all right Good I'm so happy let's go dance But you don't think I have nice shoulders and Miss Fanny Rosa! Say anything like that Hurry now Master John will be despaired waiting all this time,will you Would that be a good thing, tell me Bridget,you ought to know There was never a man yet that wasn't helped to be waiting But remind you,not too long I'll get you dressed Were you waiting for me,John? I was Well,am I worth waiting for? You are What else are you thinking? That you shall only come to life at night by candle light And then with music playing somewhere far away And what else? I was thinking if that candle should go out I might kiss you in the darkness And then After I kissed you I might want to kiss you once again and then perhaps again But we haven't time So let's go down and dance instead John when you are Master of Clonmere, you must put your footmen into livery When you are Mistress of Clonmere you can do as you please with the footmen Here,here Tim,here,you'll have room for this on your tray You wouldn't like to sit on the tray yourself I'd none of your cheek you go and attend to your work Oh yes I have to do all the work but they can go on enjoying themselves Well,isn't it a good to see a little bit of fun and jollity in the place again Are there the refreshments ready for the musicians? Yes,of course you like to hard rather than (?) Now ladies and gentlemen while the musicians have a rest Cousin Eliza accompanied by Michael Sullivan our village fiddler will play a waltz for us Saints of all,that's make you sort of endear with all the quality(?) So it is have to go into the quarter Slower Micky,slower Slower Micky can't you hear? I can't help myself,Mum,the devil in the fiddle wants to dance a gig It's wonderful like wild things from beyond the mountains I'm absolutely exhausted I must have a drink And I must change in your home,it's late and it's a long ride back to Andru Yes,yes it is If you won't persuade me to stay at least you might find me my shoes Wake up Michael Wake up Maybe only a coincidence but there is a powerful smell of whisky about here Of course he is drunk now he won't be able to ride home with me Well must I insist you come with me? Or will you send a groom? All right I'll ride with you,if you insist I'll be home before you're even in the saddle It's a wonder that you didn't break your neck riding in that devil's pace Sure the devil always will looks after his own John Look,the moon Let's ride over the hill John Why have you been so strange? So different? Have I Fanny Rosa? Yes Tell me why Because Fanny Rosa you're like a wild bird and because no one should ever put you in a cage But then no one could ever catch you,could they? I could be caught if I wished Did you ever kiss Henry like this? Henry is dead and you're alive, what has he to do with us? But do you love me,Fanny Rosa? You want me to say yes Or even one day you will love me I want to love you now What day is it today? That day we go racing with Fitzgerald But what would be the date? January or February That's all I wanted to know The Fitzes are very early Perhaps we are a bit late Holy Saints and Heaven Welcome home You might have sent a carriage for us The boat must have come in early we were just coming to meet you How we missed you these last six months Jane,darling How pretty you look It was quite wicked the way you do it You think it was a conquest? Complete the way you talk politics with father at dinner was past belief That's how my mother fascinated father she always said that if you can talk politics with a man,you keep him happy Certainly father happy all right when you started discussing the mines as though you were Nicholson you had him eating out of your hand Not quite You wait until I make him a grandfather Yes,darling,I'm going to have a baby Don't look so frightened other people do And anyway I'm going to have lots and lots of babies Perhaps we all better have a little rest Come along children we'll have tea Why,it's tiring work this being painted -Fanny behave yourself -Better say the other way round He's pulling Megan's()hair Johnny be a good boy Now Johnnie be a good boy and I'll take you to see Aunt Jane before she goes Where is she going? To India with her husband's regiment India? That means she'll come back with lots of black babies Not necessarily Now you run and tell Tim to get the trap lady for me Excuse me,Sir John,I think one of the men wants you Good Day to you Corcoran Your father is after sending me for you Mr John there's terrible troubles at the mines I shall have to take your trap Fanny Rosa Good Bye,darling Come on Corcoran Not a sound,they must be finished by now They are still alive It's not much time -Who is it you have there? -Michael Donovan,he's finished Father did you hear who that was? We can clear away the blockage in time,the water will come this way the men might be saved They might and the rest of the mine will be plugged Yes They are not even sure of saving the men But father we must try it Of course,there must be some quicker way John,that cave you found when they were stealing the copper,where was it? I think it was on the 95 fathom level,that must be it If we break up the new chamber(?) the water will be released down the mountain -How to became broken up? -Gunpowder Everyone on top Everyone on top Everybody on top Michael Michael The killed him,the blood drips of (?) More gunpowder We are not through yet They've gone away They've left us He's done it the water is all down That's right,go on,you know he saved his mine but he's killed another Donovan I've come to express my sympathy,Mrs Donovan Michael was a fine man,God Blessed Him We will not soon see his like again It's the truth she's telling you ,Mr Brodrick my brother was the finest man in this parish there is his widow now left to starve I think you'll find my father not ungenerous I wouldn't touch a penny of his filthy money Kate put some more turf on that fire I still have this shivering on me His stomach is all upset I'm sorry to hear that Denny About the things to the water Even the very water we have to drink is poisoned by your cursed mine Will you take a drop of whisky,Mr Brodrick Take it to your uncle I'm particular who I drink with I was wondering Mary since you won't accept help from my father whether you'll let me help Have you come to buy us,Mr Brodrick or it's to pay us off for the loss of my brother's life I told you as I told your Michael many a time He should never have worked for any man Least of all a Brodrick He's gone now,may the Lord be good to him But there is one thing I make sure of anywhere that Michael's son doesn't do the same thing I could get on well with the Donovan family if it weren't for some of the Donovans themselves Hello Doctor Anything that matters? Henry burnt his finger You mean Johnnie burnt it for him,nothing serious though Aren't you staying to dinner? I'd like to but there is a case of typhoid,it's very urgent -Anyone we know? -Denny Donovan You're sure it's Denny Donovan and it is typhoid? Yes Why? I was with him this afternoon In his own house If you brought that infection back to my Johnnie I'll never ever forgive you There is nothing more we can do now, Fanny Rosa,but you must get some sleep Is he any better now? And if you are not careful we'll have Fanny Rosa collapsing on your hands She hasn't been to bed for six nights now and what's more this is a highly infectious disease Fanny Rosa Always here when I wake up And care for me Of course I'm always here What's happened to that wild bird? You never let me catch you You caught her long ago,my darling You're the only one that matters It's strange I never really knew it until now I'm glad I went to the Donovans Why my darling did you have to do such a stupid thing You're worse than all the children put together I had an idea to have made peace with them -I know it was an unexpected thing -It was that Only unexpected hope to work in this country Such a terrible worry to all(?)of them You made me cry It's all your fault You cried seriously I'm not worthy of actual tears I'll remind you of that when you are better Your hopeless (neff?) I know I'm the most worthless of all the Brodricks But at least I've been the very happiest Johnny Johnny Johnny Johnny Johnny come here at once Johnny Why did you pour ink over my desk? Ink? I haven't been into the library today I didn't do it -Tell the truth,Johnny -I am telling the truth And I tell you I didn't do it -You are lying -I'm not lying,you old fool Mama he's beating me Stop it leave him alone How dare you hit my son? Your son told me a deliberate lie I consider it is my duty to punish him It's not for you to punish Johnnie It is (?) who will deal with him You Fanny Rosa Have never laid hands on Johnnie since the day he was born If that boy grows into a man without friends or future utterly wild,unmannered and beyond control it will be your fault and yours alone I shouldn't think you've so much proud of the way you brought up your sons No Fanny Rosa I always regretted that I never understood John better It is because of that I spoke For it will be sad if both John and his son should suffer from parents who realize their mistakes too late You know,Timothy,sometimes I think I've spoiled Johnny a little He is so impulsive He is that Mrs John and he is a wild boy And his grandfather is too hard on him He doesn't understand him at all I'm sure his father,Mr John, God Rest the Soul surely was always in trouble with the Master too but then he was plain and he was gentle and master Johnny well he has a quick temper all right I tell you,Johnny,so far as I am Master of Clonmere I will not tolerate such behaviour -What about-To be seen riding through the village with that Kate Donovan Have you no sense of decency? I'll be seeing with whoever I like and I think it is about time I was allowed to live as I like Unfortunately,Johnny your mother has allowed you to do so since the day you were born And from what I hear not even the army can teach you to behave like a gentleman If I have to stay here much longer I'd shoot the old fool Johnny He is threatened to cut my allowance now what there is of it -You seem to like whisky -Is there anything wrong in that? No dear so long as you don't drink too much But I don't Why doesn't he die and leave us alone You mustn't talk like that Then we'll have the place to ourselves, just you and I,wouldn't we,mother? Sir Thank you Timothy You know,Sir,you shouldn't be upsetting yourself Master Johnny he is young and surely be leaving soon anyway You know you should be taken a rest,you are wearing yourself out What with the trouble in the house and the work at the mine Nonsense I can still do two men's work Of course I know you can but where is the sense in it? With Master Harry doing so well up at the mines You know at your age,Sir,you Have my carriage sent round at once I'm going up to the mines immediately But Oh yes,Sir My age Hello darling Forgive me if I kept you waiting London suits you,you look wonderful And you are still as lovely as ever Thank you Johnny How is everything at home? -Grandfather well? -Yes -I've never any luck -Johnny Excuse me a moment while I change What's all the excitement about tonight? Who are these people I'm taking out to dinner? We are having a celebration Henry has been made High Sheriff of the County Brother Harry a Sheriff? Well,if that's what he wants I suppose we should celebrate Who else? Loving little fiddlesticks Who else did you say? Oh,Molly and Fanny and her husband Bill Are you a grandmother yet? Not quite And Bill's sister Katherine Earl a charming girl Who is Doody? One of the many And don't read all my letters Some of them might shock you Don't you believe it At least John was a secret drinker -I only be a minute,darling -All right,Mother -You must be Johnnie Brodrick -Yes I am You must forgive but I can't quite you know All right you needn't be gallant, you've never seen me before I've seen you though,several times You are very like your portraits Oh you evidently been to Clonmere Mother had me painted regularly John,Katherine my dear You never told me you knew Catherine I never knew that I did Hello Harry how are you?

Yes,Sam Donovan I must say that's funny A Brodrick saving a Donovan Give everybody a drink,landlord Sam I've been almost losing my mind, they said you were killed No I wasn't killed at all, I'm alive and doing well My sister Kate There is no need to run away I think you didn't want to recognize me What did you think that? Come and have a drink Sir,I never touch it so All right at least come and sit down Look at that lads,a Brodrick and Donovan drinking together Enough to make Morty Donovan turn over in his coffin And Copper John too It might had been better if I had been killed Why what's the troubles,Sam? Our house is burnt down me and my sister are homeless and living on the neighbours these days past But Johnnie,they are Donovans they can't live in our lodge house,you can't be serious I'm serious,all right Nobody has anything to do with them, you must get rid of them immediately I shall do nothing of the sort You really don't expect me to live here with that sly little Kate Donovan peering at me every time I drive passed Besides I've given the lodge to Mrs O'Brien It doesn't happen to be yours to give Oh I see Mother I think it's time we had an understanding For years I pictured this all we do together but now it doesn't work,it's a failure Yes,it's a failure What you really mean is It would be better for both of us if I lived somewhere else Yes Well I'm glad you told me Mothers are so blind I wonder what would have happened if your father had lived Mother Don't let's make a tragedy of this,Johnnie But it is a tragedy No, I should be all right There's the London house I shall give parties and be very gay Good night Light is out now,Master Johnny anything more you want tonight No thank you,Timothy Dear Cpt Johnny some more of your favourites pies for supper What will I do without you Kate I shall need someone to look after you,Cpt Come and sit down and make yourself comfortable Tell me doesn't Sam gone over to Monday for the night? He has indeed And what on earth have you got to go home for? Yes,Harry has his schedule I own my Kate(?) Yes but why do you want to go? -Well,Master Johnny,I.. -Oh,speak up man! well we're Bridget and myself we are getting old and everything is different now that Mrs John has left I see Of course it's not easy for us to be leaving Clonmere while we've been nearly all our lives Look why don't you say what you are thinking -Isn't it because I.. -Master Johnny You're living in the way that you think best You must allow us to do the same It's no use,Harry if the mines aren't making money we have to close them down But Johnnie we ought to try them keep them going if only for the men's sake and their families Why the devil should we? I'm not running these mines for charity But Johnnie shall we think it over? What is there to think over you know the figures better than I do The mines close down at the end of the month You can tell the men whenever you like Oh Johnnie I've been tiding up I hope you don't mind No,of course not I'm so pleased to see you I was on my way back for spending the day with the Bennett I got a sudden wild notion to come and see you It's months since you've been to see us I find I'm always rather occupied You are still unhappy aren't you? Like you were when I first met you What gives you that impression? Yes,you are unhappy I revel in misery -May I offer you something to drink? -Thank you no,Johnnie But do have something yourself Remarkable everybody else I know tries to stop me drinking I should too if I thought you drink too much Yes that spoilt it I underrated your cleverness Not my cleverness,my sympathy What is it Johnny?What's gone wrong? Have you come here to save me? No To help you if you let me Nobody can help me I could I'm sure Well as a matter of fact,Katherine, I'm in terrible trouble up here No I can't tell you anymore than that I'll be ashamed to You've been unhappy Unhappy people often do foolish things I'm sure it is not worse than that Katherine if you knew for how long I wanted to see you again How I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry Cpt I didn't know that you wanted to be alone Get out Donovan Get out I understand Cpt I understand I think you ought to go Katherine,now I'm not upset what Donovan may think I tell you you ought to go do you mind? I don't want you here Of course Johnny you're probably right You're a much nicer person than you'll ever know I though I told you to get out of here I have something important to see you about Mr Brodrick Sorry I am,that I interrupted your bit of fun -Get out you smile,get out -You're tired Mr Brodrick So I'll be back in the morning I'm telling you to get out of this place To get out of Clonmere There is something for me to say first My sister Kate wouldn't it be too bad if she had to suffer now The Brodrick destroyed the Donovans again wasn't enough for you maybe So now your brother's wife as well Perhaps now you get out and take your sister with you But let me tell you one thing If ever you set foot anywhere on my estates again I warn you I kill you Sam Donovan yes I kill you And great pity it ever happened But it's all settled you say The girl made no trouble at all I think it might be a good idea if you went to London -For holiday -I'm not running away Of course you're not but there is another reason for going,mother Why? What's happened to her? I'm not quite sure Unless you know she's been spending a lots of money recently much more than she needs Last month she spent 900 pounds and now I hear she's sold the house You ought to go you might find out what's happening I wish you would ,Johnnie It's a fraud,I tell you a fraud the whole place is run by trickery, that man is cheating The whole of London should hear about this How dare you touch me,leave me alone I shall have this place closed down Please madam,don't make a scene it's just a matter of luck tonight you lost tomorrow you'll make a fortune Nonsense now look what you've done Thank you very much,young man That's very kind of you Johnnie Hello mother You've changed darling Last Thursday I think it was I won over 400 pounds and the next day another two I'd thought I'd found a perfect system But tonight they must have changed the one of the wheel or something because of course all this people are dreadfully dishonest But I'll beat them I'll have another run But mother you must realize that you can't find a perfect Mother I haven't been sleeping very well lately Johnnie and I found Johnnie Johnnie Well you had your whiskey why shouldn't I have Oh Johnnie Why did you come? I'm much better left alone Why on earth did you come? I've told you mother I've told you already I've come to take you home Home? -To Ireland? -To Clonmere It's too late,Johnnie It's too late But listen,mother We both helped each other to become what we are today And we are both to blame The only thing left for us now is to help each other again but if we can to become something different But it is time for you, Johnnie, you're young Not for me You don't understand I'm thinking about myself and what might happen if I go back alone Like when I was a little boy and I I couldn't stay in the dark by myself Now It's just the same again Please Please Johnnie,you are sure aren't you that it is not too late Quite sure Timothy Bridget It's nice that you are back again Mrs John This is home again indeed -And you too Master John -Thanks ,Timothy And it is good that you are both back here too Bridget You know he called me Mrs John not Mrs Brodrick that was always a good sign in the old days How I wonder,Timothy where is Mr Henry? Sure of course I knew there was something I forgot to tell you Master Harry said he'd be back later There is troubles at the mine with them closing down Of course I've forgotten I'd better go and see if I can help No darling leave it to Henry he knows all there is to know about the mine besides it's getting late No,no I must go,you see it's my fault really I think perhaps we ought to keep the men on just for a while at any rate And you get back to your extraordinary housekeeping I will be very hungry when I come home You'd better keep the mine working otherwise it will be worse for you Why can't we go on working When my grandfather started these mines copper sold at 90 £ a ton Now with cheap ore being shipped into England from abroad we are lucky if we can get 20 £ a ton And that's why my brother has ordered the mines to be closed Then why isn't your brother here to say so Listen to me,listen to me,listen to me I ordered the closing of the mines because they'd be run at a loss But now I think we should try and find some way to carry on That's nothing but promises they talk There's been too much of that already So it's you again Donovan The mine is no affair of yours And I haven't come here to quarrel with you Sam Donovan It these men and their work I'm thinking about now It's all lies I tell you all Brodrick lies My Johnnie was murdered But every man of them deny ever pushing him down the shaft I tell you he was murdered And my other son likely so badly as he hurt And you accept me to agree that nobody is to blame is that it? Not that Mrs Brodrick,all I say there is strong doubt in the case Could be passed off as a common brawl But if you insist that we charge them with murder and riot I do insist Then it'll mean that Donovan and the ring leaders are liable to hung for murder and the others to penal servitude for riot I'm glad Good Day Mr Hennessey Mrs Brodrick I want to speak to you Mrs Brodrick Well what is it? I was thinking of myself what a pity it is that your husband,Mr John,God Rest Him isn't with us now and what he might have done What do you mean? Mr John had an understanding of these people because he had a love for them and of others had listened to them when he was alive should this many of troubles would never had happened My son was murdered they must suffer for it Mr John was never the man for believing in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,he knew that if hatreds are ever to be stopped well then Brodricks must be forgetting that they are Brodricks and no Donovan remembering that it is a Donovan was it not because of that he went to their house and got his death from the cruel fever? And I know that if Mr John was here that he'd not be for having Sam Donovan hung And he'll be right I'm thinking what this would mean to the children there would be Brodricks and Donovan Catherine you? There will be a hard thing for them to grow up with the Donovan curse on them "I know of (?) feeling but later only the unexpected could have ever helped to work this country" Timothy You may go and tell Mr Hennessey that I changed my mind, I'm withdrawing the charge You can tell him it's because Only the unexpected Can ever hope to work in Ireland I'm so glad,I'm so happy And I know you'll be happier too I go and tell Harry Mrs John I can tell you now That neither you nor any Brodrick to come will ever have want for friends in these parts as long Timothy you talk too much I know,like a terrible tongue But a very wise one And I think I've learned a little wisdom too God Bless You I hope that after now after all the misery Hungry Hill would be at peace again Once more green and beautiful And that the Brodricks and the Donovans will live quietly together at last Subtitles by Seglora
