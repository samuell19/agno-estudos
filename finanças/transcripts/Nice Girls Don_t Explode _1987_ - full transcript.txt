(soft whimsical music) (camera shutter clicking) (bright music) (hand knocking) Honey, he's waiting. - [April] Mom. I have nothing to wear. - That's a lovely outfit, April. - Mom. - Oh, April, you can still back out. - I've been practicing and I think I've got it under control. - Oh, April, your last date was just a year ago. You really think it'll be any different this time? - I've got my pulse rate down to 58. - 58? Oh. That's very encouraging. I'm sure everything will be just fine. April. - What? - Did you pack some protection? - Mom. - April. - I won't need it. - I trust you. I don't trust him. (upbeat jazz music) - Good evening, sir. - Watch your hands, will ya? April. This is your night. Oh, be careful. Here, take my hand. I told you. Whoa. Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you. Yourself? - Oh, I'm fine.

(radio chattering) (fire crackling) (metal clanking) - Call me. I totaled his Corvette. - Well. You're moving up in the world. Last time it was only a Honda. - Mom. - I'm sorry. You're a very brave, young lady. - You know, Mom. When my hormones first acted up and started fires, you said it was just a phase I was going through like pimples or chapped lips or something. - Chapped lips? - You know what I mean. I go out on dates and the only men who see me more than once are firemen. What am I supposed to do? Spend my whole life at home with you? - Give me your other foot, dear. - I'll get better. - [Mrs. Flowers] Yes. - I just need a little more experience. - Sweetheart, if you get much more experience, you're liable to burn up the whole town. - Mom. - I'm sorry, April.

Helen would be an absurd name for a guy. - Goodbye, Helen. - That's Ellen. - Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Oh, you really should take better care of yourself. - Oh, my therapist says that if you wanna make friends, you've got to take chances. - Thank you, Helen. - That's Ellen. - I'm sorry, Ellen.

What are you doing here? - Silly me. I over baked. - Oh. That's very thoughtful of you. I'll just go on and put these in the kitchen. - Sure. - You know, these are the same oatmeal raisin cookies you used to give me and April when we were little. I need my pants. - Sit down, Andy. - Yeah. I need my pants. - Sit. Thought we might have a little chat. - Can I just have my pants? - No. - Why not? - So how does it feel? - What do you mean how does it feel? - How does it feel to sit in front of someone's mom in your underwear? - I don't believe this is happening to me. - How does it feel? - What do you mean how does it feel? How would you like to sit in front of me in your underwear? - Don't get fresh with me, young man. - Huh. - Do you feel vulnerable? - Yeah. - Do you feel like any moment something bad could happen? That you're not really in control of anything? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about how April feels every time she's with you. Scared, vulnerable, out of control. Always in danger. - Because she's a fire girl? - [Mrs. Flowers] That's right, Andy. - Mrs. Flowers? - Yes. - I don't think April's a fire girl. - You don't? - No. I think someone's secretly starting those fires on purpose to make April dump me. - Oh. Oh, oh. - Yeah. - Oh. I knew you'd figure it out sooner or later. - You mean I'm right? - I'm afraid so, Andy. Oh, our poor, little April. April. April. Our little April has a split personality. - Excuse me. - April has a personality split. I thought you knew. - No. - Yes. The poor girl has two people inside of her. The good April is the April that likes you and the other April, the bad one, hates men and secretly starts fires to keep them away from the good April and of course the good April knows nothing about this. - April's a lunatic? And you expect me to believe that? - You don't really believe she starts fires with her hormones, do you (laughs)? (bright music) - I've been to doctors before and they just look at me like I'm crazy. - That's what we're here to find out. - [Operator] Dr. Gordon, 247. - You really think I have split personality? - April, April. - What? What? That's not funny. - I'm sorry. I don't think you have a split personality, but I have another theory. I just wanna make sure. - What theory? - [Andy] I can't tell you without proof. - You know, Rudy, I finally figured it out, man. - What's that, Nicky? - What's wrong with our lives. We don't have fun anymore, man. - Well, do you think we should go back to hacking up sides of beef? - Hey man, you know we had pretty good times in that slaughterhouse. - Yeah, we sure did, didn't we, man? - You know what I told that supervisor he could do with those polish sausage? - [Mrs. Flowers] Psst. Psst. (upbeat music) - [Nick] Yeah, right, man. - No, no, see man, you not listening. - I'm listening, all right. - No, no, can you believe him? - Now you see, you don't understand, man. Ping pong is more than a game. It's an art form. - No. - Yeah. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah, yeah, man. Listen to me now. - I don't believe it, man. - [Rudy] Yes, you do, man. You gotta believe it. - April. Wait here. I'll be right back. Hey, hey, hey. Wait up, wait up. (upbeat music) Hi. - When you get mad and start those fires, it's just your way of saying that you're lonely and need a friend. - I know, I know, I know. - And if you want to make friends, you've got to take chances. - You've got to take chances. I know, I know. Hey. Maybe sometime me and you could get together and have a barbecue. You know, like buddies. - Goodbye, Helen. - That's Ellen. (soft dramatic music) Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I didn't catch your name. - I'm April. - I'm Ellen. - Ellen? That's. That's a beautiful name. - Really? You like it? - Well yes. It's very lyrical. - It was my father's name. - Huh. (upbeat music) (men laughing) - Just calm down. Take it like a man. - Yeah, like a man. Don't forget the message. - Oh yeah, oh yeah, the message. This is April's way of saying I love you. (upbeat music) - Hey, look, let's get this over with. Rudy, get the blade. (soft dramatic music) - Come on. Come on, come on. Tell me your problem. - No, really. I just can't. - All right. I'll tell you mine first. I start fires. - You too? - What? (men laughing) (upbeat music) - [Nick] There, there. That wasn't so bad, was it? - The first one's always a little scary. Now we gon' leave the left one the way it is. - Now that's for contrast. - [Rudy] Yeah, contrast. - [Nick] Oh, you like that one? - [Rudy] Yeah, I like it. - Maybe sometime we could go out and start fires together. - Well, that's sweet, but I'm trying to quit. - Me too. - [Doctor] April. - Well, see you around. - Really? (phone ringing) April. (soft dramatic music) April. (soft dramatic music) - April Flowers, please report to room eight. (soft dramatic music) - Oh my god. (soft dramatic music) Andy. ("Fever") But why would I shave your legs? - I don't know. Same reason you start fires to scare me away. - Oh, you really believe that? Boy, you are so gullible. - What, you think maybe I'm crazy? I shaved myself. - Andy, Andy. - What? What? That's not funny. - I'm sorry. What are you doing? - No matches. No lighter fluid. No hormones. (man screaming) - I'll get a comb. (bright music) - What are you doing in my bathroom? - Silly me. I over baked again. - Could you please hand me a towel? - I'm not here to talk about towels, Andy. - Jesus, I don't believe this. - Andy, I know how badly you wanna play ping pong in China. - Why won't you hand me my towel? - It cost a lot of money to go to China. Probably more than you have. - Uh huh. - April's grandmother left us a small nest egg. - Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? - I'm prepared to write you a check for $5,000 to help your career. Of course, you'll have to forget about April. - Just one question. - Do we have this understanding? - May I ask you a question, please? - Of course, Andy. What is it? - Did you set me up in the hospital to have my leg shaved? - Yes, I did. I paid those gentlemen to remove the hair from your legs. - Oh. That's. That's. That's despicable. - I apologize, Andy. - [Andy] April doesn't have a split personality. - Correct. - [Andy] You made up the story about April being a lunatic. - Right again. - [Andy] And you're the one who's been starting all those fires. - Don't be ridiculous. - But you just said. - I said I wanted to scared you away from April. I didn't wanna see either of you get hurt. I figure it would be easier for you to accept April's fire problem if you thought it was psychological. - You didn't start all those fires? - Dear boy, I'm trying to stop them. (phone ringing) (man laughing) Andy. (man laughing) I wouldn't do that if I were you, Andy. - Yeah, right. Ha. (soft whimsical music) April. No. It's the wrong number. - What about China? - I think I'll just wait for my ping pong scholarship to come through. - I'm proud of you, Andy. - Huh? - It was just my way of testing your feelings for April. You're a fine, young man. - What? - A good man, Andy. Andy, where did you get this shaving cream? - I just bought it. - Oh. Do you know what depilatory means? - It's shaving cream for legs. - Andy, can you say depilatory? - Depilatory. - Very good. ("Fever") - Depilatory. Any device or substance used to remove hair. Shaving cream. ("Fever") (man screaming) Oh my god. - That's right. Two cruise tickets. Tomorrow the fourth of July. Huh? No. The Virgin Islands. Just one way. Oh okay, bye bye. Oh. Andy. - I'm here. - You poor boy. I am sorry about that. - I really don't wanna talk about it. - Oh. Oh. Control. Control. Control. Control. Oh. - You should put some lotion on it, so you don't get a rash. Cookies? - No cookies. - Can I get you something cold? - Hi, Andy. - Oh. - You're like ice. - Took an ice bath. Andy. Kiss me. - Oh geez, you big goof. - Please. - Come on, honey. Let's get you into a hot tub. We'll talk about this later. - Please. - April. - April, no. Not in the house, April. Not in the house, April. - Ha. - Ah. (bright music) - It worked. It worked. I froze it away. Mom. - In a second. - Mom. I did it. Mom, I did it. There's no fires. Mom. - What? - Come on. (bright music) - Oh. You kids are excellent. Do you smell that? - [Andy] Smell what? - [Mrs. Flowers] That. - Smoke. - It smells like hair. Like burning hair. - Ah. - Like burning cat hair. Fluffy. - Fluffy. - Fluffy? - My baby. (soft dramatic music) Don't worry. Only his neck. - His neck? - His neck. - I'm gonna take Fluffy to the vet. You two stay here and frolic. - Oh. April, this is nuts. What's wrong? (soft dramatic music) What are you doing? (soft dramatic music) I'm sorry, Fluffy. I'm sorry you got your neck burnt. I'm real sorry the vet made you wear this stupid collar. And I'm real sorry I'll never see you again. I know you don't owe me any favors but. Would you give this to April, huh? Would you give this to her? Wow, you sure heal fast. (soft whimsical music) Whoa. (soft whimsical music) - Andy, what are you doing here? - Silly me. I over baked. - Give me my robe. - I'm not here to talk about robes. Here, let me help you with that. - Andy. - Oh my. Oh. - You really should put some lotion on that. - Henry, I think we should call the police. - All right, dear. - Sit. I thought we might have a little chat. - Cookie? - Thank you. - Hm, still playing with your food, are you? - You've got to tell her the truth. I saw Fluffy. He's not burned. Are you gonna tell her the truth? Or do you want April to hear it from me first? - Andy, you don't understand. April must never know I started those fires. She would hate me for the rest of my life. - Are you gonna tell her or does she hear it from me first? - All right. I'll tell her. It's all right. (soft dramatic music) ("Fever") (hand knocking) Thank God you're here. He's up there. - Freeze. (man screaming) - Don't move. (woman screaming) - This isn't what it looks like. - It sure looks like it to me. - I can explain. - Shut up, butt face. - Andy. - [Andy] April. - What are you doing here? - [Andy] I'm here to see your mother. - Oh, you and mom. What are you saying? - Me and mom? - Please, everyone. It's all right. I can explain. All right, Andy, the truth. April, dear. Please, come sit down. - Mom, what is it? - Please, ma'am, tell us what happened in your own words. - I'm not sure exactly why he did it. - Did what? - Did what? - Did what? - It was just after my shower. I came into the bedroom to get my robe and I saw him standing there. And then he threw all my clothes out the window. And watched me. - Andy. - I wasn't watching her. I just didn't want her to put her clothes on. - And then he pulled down his pants and he took my skin lotion and put it all over his, below his waist. - You mean on his? Ooh. - And then while he watched me, he. He took that razor and shaved all the hair off of his hoo hoo. - Oh, Andy, how could you? - I did it with Nair. Forget I said that. - All right, come on. Let's examine the evidence. - Smooth as ping pong balls. - Come on, little shaver. Let's go. - No. Hold it. April, I didn't have to be the one to tell you this, but your mother's been lying to you about the fires. I can prove it. Fluffy's not burned. This is fake just like everything else. It's shoe polish or something. - Give me my cat. What did he do to the cat? - I like cats. - You like sheep? - Not in the same way. - [April] I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't know he was a pervert. - April, your mother admitted the whole thing. I've got her confession on tape. Listen. - Andy, shut up. (bright music) - No, no, wait. (bright music) No. No, no. (bright music) Touch me again and I'll break it off. - You're beautiful when you're angry. - Open. Quit clowning around. Lock up. - Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I didn't catch your name. - I'm Andy. - I'm Ellen. - Don't turn your back on him. - [Man] Hey, Helen, come over here. - Excuse me. That's Ellen. - [Man] Helen? - Ellen. (fire crackling) I get really stressed out sometimes. (upbeat music) - Well. That's it. We're all set for our big adventure. - Forgot one thing. - What's that, honey? - I've forgotten about Andy. (upbeat music) - I was trying to get a girl's address from my therapist. - You got arrested for that? - I set his couch on fire. - Oh. Must be some girl. - Women. - Can't live with 'em. - Can't burn them. (upbeat music) - She's leaving tonight. I'll never see her again and she thinks I'm a pervert. - That's terrible. - If only there was some way I could get out of here. Make her understand. - You really love this girl, don't you? - I guess so. - I know exactly how you feel. That's for me. I've got a great lawyer. - Good luck with your girl. - Hey, good luck with your girl. - Thanks. Take care, buddy. - Buddy? (soft music) - Open. All right, Ellen, you're out of here. Don't tell me. Let me guess. You must be Ellen. - That's right. This is my good buddy Ellen. Go get her, buddy. (soft music) - Lock up. (soft music) (upbeat music) - [Andy] Whoa. (tires screeching) - Your old flame is back. - Come here, come on. I wanna prove something to you once and for all. (soft dramatic music) - Andy. Don't do it. Fluffy forgives you. - Come on, I got it all figured out. - Andy, what is the matter with you? - You'll be safe here. - Safe from what, Andy? - April, get down from there this instant. - Stay. - April, I'm not going to tell you again. - I love you. - Come on, honey, we've got a boat to catch. - Mom. - There's a fire girl in your family but it's not you. - April, if Andy wants to go up in flames, you don't have to help him. You don't want that on your conscious. - There won't be any fire unless you start it. (dramatic music) Kiss me. - [Mrs. Flowers] April. - I don't think your mom would fry me. (soft dramatic music) ("Fever") - No. - April. - Oh, April. (dramatic music) Andy. (dramatic music) - You saved my life. - Any mom would've done the same. - Are you all right? - Nothing a little salt air wouldn't cure. - Oh, thank you. Thank you for saving. Thanks for being my mom. - Thank you. What have you got there, dear? - Looks like a thing for the TV. - Give me this. May I see it? - That's it. - April. April. Honey, come on, your hormones are acting up. (explosion booming) - Yes. Yes. (upbeat music) (explosion booming) (crowd applauding) - Show's over. - April. (somber music) - Mrs. Flowers, April and I have had a long talk and we've decided considering the situation that April should move away with me. - Move? - It would be best. - April. (somber music) I understand. - My ping pong scholarship came through. I'll be playing in China and also living there for awhile with April. - China? My baby's moving to China. - You can keep Fluffy here. They eat cats in China. (cat groaning) (somber music) - Oh, all right, April. I guess it's time you learned the truth. - What truth? - The truth. Cookie. Truth, truth. The truth. Honey, you remember reading about that horrible person who went to supermarkets and put poison in aspirin bottles? - Uh huh. - Well, that's not a new crime. It happened 13 years ago in a little grocery store just a few blocks from here. Only that time the poison wasn't put in aspirin. It was put in vanilla extract. - What kind of poison? - Oh, a very, very, very rare, rare substance called mini flam. - Mini flam? - Mm hm. It's a small, more condensed version of nitroglycerin. - Mini flam? - They caught the guy who did it. Then recalled all the vanilla extract except for one bottle purchased by a young mother, who used it in a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies. - That's my favorite. - And only one person ate those. Those explosive mini flam cookies. Beautiful little five year old girl. - Don't listen to her. - Sh. - April. - Sh. - A few days later, the young mother read about the poisoned vanilla extract and rushed her daughter to the hospital to have her stomach pumped but it was too late. The explosive mini flam compound had already metabolized into the little girl's body. - Wow. - Give me a break. - The doctor said the little girl could lead an active, almost normal life until she grew up. - What happens when she grows up? - April. - Well, April, that's hard to explain without a lot of medical mumbo jumbo. - You're talking about me, aren't you? - Here we go. - But because of the way girls are built and the explosive nature of mini flam, if the little girl with the special problem ever gets together with a boy, the resulting friction and heat could create a critical temperature imbalance in the girl. - No. Don't tell me. Let me guess. - If I ever make love, I'll explode. - And that's why I pulled this fire caper to keep you away from boys so that I wouldn't lose you. - Oh. - I hope you'll forgive me, April. - Mini flam. - Andy, please, don't rub it in. - You know she's lying. She knows you're lying. April, April. There's only one way to prove your mother wrong. - April. We have to talk. April. (thunder rumbling) - Are you sure about this? - What's the matter? You don't really think I'll explode, do you? - No. No, of course not. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - April. April, I know you're in there. April. (rain pattering) April. April. April. April. April. We have to talk. Okay. I'll talk, you listen. Honey, there's only one thing tougher than being a mom. And that's not being a mom. Now just stop for one second and take a look at your belly button. That's the spot where your umbilical cord used to be for we were physically connected. Everything I ate, drank, and breathed went through that cord and nourished you. You're a part of me. I was part of you. We were a real team. I wanted us to keep on being a team and not let our relationship shrivel up like a belly button. Let me rephrase that. - Do you think Mom will be fooled? - Sure. She'll think we're still in the hammock. - April. You think that I made 3,289 peanut butter sandwiches, 8,600 glasses of Ovaltine, and over 30,000 cookies just so some ping pong player to come and take you away. No siree Bob. I mean, what do you expect? I know it was terrible thing I did, but it's because I never learned the hardest part. I never learned to let go. (cat screeching) Fluffy?
