STUDIO 1 PRESENTS AGNUS DEI To save us from our sad plight Hiya ho ho Florian Geyer leads our fight Hiya ho ho Peasants go ahead, attack The tyrant's house burn and wreck Hiya ho ho Where did you learn this? What is this song? - A song from the German Peasants' War. - Sing it again. Defeat has come upon our kin Hiya ho ho But my grandson will live to win Hiya ho ho Do not sing this verse again. Understood? - Take him away! - Come on! Let's go! "Woe to the sinful nation, a people whose guilt is great "a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! "They have forsaken the Lord." Tell them to leave us alone. - What should I tell them? - Not to make things hard for us. If we lay a hand on a priest, we can't go back, the women will kill us. "Woe to the world for temptations to sin! "For it is necessary that temptations come, "but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes! "You carry out plans that are not mine, "forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, "heaping sin upon sin. "But if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken." Stand up. - Get up! - You idiot! What are you doing, you beast? Stop! Come back! You'll kill him, you fool. Come on. You can join them. Sea of light of the Eternal Light You are my golden treasure When my tired hands cannot fight anymore Raise your flag Whores! Killing a priest? You wretch. "Then the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth "and said to me, "'Listen, my people, I have put my words in your mouth. See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.'" Those who are with me will not be disappointed in you, Lord. Those who hold my hand, are holding your hand, God of armies." Here's your cassock, go. "Those who are with me will not be disappointed in you. "Those who hold my hand, are holding your hand, God of armies." The waves are tossing my little ship around I rest my head on your fatherly bosom Don't leave me, my God I rest my head on your fatherly bosom Don't leave me... Go away. "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve." Forget your old-world drills. I don't mean to offend you, but how did you become a commander? You're not being wise. You let him go, and bring me to trial in handcuffs. You're not smart enough. Yours is a funny organization, Father. There are all sorts of people amongst you, and you tolerate all sorts of things. It may have taken you 2000 years, but to tell you the truth, I couldn't wait that long. Not even if I belonged to the triumphant church. Put this away, then take them. We're ready to go. Giddy up. What happened? What's with her? She needs water. Stop! Stop there! Give me water. Quick. "I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness "in forsaking me, "in burning incense to other gods "and in worshiping what their hands have made." Firing at a priest, sonny? Load your rifle first. "The axe is already at the root of the trees, "and every tree that does not produce good fruit "will be cut down and thrown into the fire." Keep your bread. And don't bless it, not with bloody hands. You know what the Scriptures say, Reverend, "The Lord spits the lukewarm out." The Reverend may not deserve this cassock. Take it off! Take it off! "God, Lord of armies, "you who examine the righteous "and probe the heart and mind, "let me see your vengeance on them, "for the land is full of adulterers, "because of the curse the land lies parched, "the pastures are withered, "the prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly. "They burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways, "made them walk on roads not built up. "And the Lord abandoned his unfaithful servant." The Hungarian ruling class is facing a difficult task once more. Those who attack us, attack the eternal law. Let me introduce my comrades. The two bravest. The only ones who remain. Here are the prisoners. Bring them up here! What do you wish for, sinful man With a soul so sorrowful What are you bemoaning wistfully With tearful eyes As if divine providence Was not watching over you As if He was not watching your suffering From the heavens "Why then have these people turned away? "They cling to deceit; they refuse to return. "I have listened, but they do not say what is right. "None of them repent of their wickedness, saying, 'What have I done?' "Therefore I will give their wives to other men "and their fields to new owners for there is no peace. "Are they ashamed? No, they have no shame at all; "they do not even know how to blush. "'I will take away their harvest', declareth the Lord." Here. Take it. For a thousand years on end This has been the Magyars' land Now the foe wants to destroy them But the Almighty will defend them Take her. Here. A hundred pieces must be cut out from the body in such a way that the prisoner remain conscious. To attain this, it is essential to leave intact the brain that registers pain and the heart that supplies oxygen to the brain. The prisoners must to be washed and tied to the stake fully naked so that every part of their bodies is in full view. The stake must be just high enough for their heads to lean against it. In this way, the neck in its erect position will let more blood pass through to the head, which is bound to the stake. The binding must be done with strong ropes and nodes tied fast, but such that these will not constrain the blood flow. After carefully selecting the tools with which the sentence shall be executed, we must thoroughly disinfect them. Saws, axes, knives, pliers, pincers, chisels come into consideration. Excisions must not be done in haste. The body will gradually adapt to pain without fainting. The process is best begun at the limbs, that is, the hands and the feet. Fingers should be nipped off one by one, preferably using pliers. Limiting or stopping bleeding is a simple procedure. A thick solution made of masterwort is poured onto the open wound, the active ingredient in the plant will cause the blood vessels to contract, thus, the loss of blood will be insignificant. A skilled executioner will complete the excision of the 100 pieces in an hour, and death will only occur in the 80th to 85th minute. After cutting off the limbs and stopping the bleeding, there shall be a break, and the condemned shall be made to talk. He must be asked whether he feels pain in his legs or arms. They always say they feel no pain. Talking is important, that is why the tongue must not be torn out. Talking gives endurance and helps to maintain mutual contact. After the break comes the trunk, with the excision of the left side of the chest. then come the protruding parts of the head: the ears and the nose. They eyes are put out last. By the end of the 60th minute, 87 out of 206 bones are left in the condemned's body and after his eyes have been put out, he'll live on for some 20 to 25 minutes. Up until now, the most successful order has been the following: knuckles of the left hand, metacarpal bones of the left hand, metacarpal bones of the right hand, wrist joint, cubit bone, radius and humerus of the left arm. Tibia, fibula and femur. Please get her here, sir. Bring her here. Please, sir, would you mind... They are not married. - Wed them. - All right. Bring them here. At least the child should have a lawful name. Stop here. Run! Go. Run. "I am the Lord, your God. "You shall have no other gods before me. "You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above "or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. "You shall not bow down to them or worship them; "for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, "punishing the children for the sin of the parents "to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, "but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me "and keep my commandments." "Praise be to the Lord, because he has come to his people and redeemed them. "And you, my child, you will go on before the Lord "to prepare the way for him "to give his people the knowledge of salvation." I confess to God Almighty... I have fornicated... I am truly repentant... I beg for absolution... I think you know, Reverend, that we will execute your man. Would you let him administer the last rites? Go ahead. We ought to examine what you have done here. But we have no time. We must go. It would be easiest to gun you all down. It's not ethics that is stopping me, nor your old Scriptures. All who draw the sword will die by the sword. No, I couldn't stomach it, I think. We'll be back. If not today, tomorrow. I don't want people to call us murderers. - May I speak? - Go ahead. You're being sentimental, comrade Kerekes. They ought to be shot. The revolution has failed. These people will kill for sure. But you'll let them loose, I know. For the time being, you're the commander. If we were to vote, you would convince everyone you were right. You'll quote Rosa, "Proletarian revolution is a form of fight where victory is reached through defeats." You ought to be brought to trial for being an opportunist. Violence must be met by violence. Well, we must go. Every man is needed in defeat. Whose daughter are you? I know you. Remember something if you're so devout. Remember for yourself and your child. "The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory with his angels, "and then he will reward each person according to what they have done." He will. Reverend, with the help of God, we won. Miklós Horthy of Nagybánya is our leader. Hurray! Here. Get up. Take her. Get off the cart. Everybody, get off. Stop. Our father, Árpád.

On your feet. Fall in. Strip to the waist. Attention. Right face. Three paces forward. Right turn. Double up. One, two... Now play. For a thousand years on end This has been the Magyars' land Now the foe wants to destroy them But the Almighty will defend them Hey ho, Gone are all the sorrows and the pain Hey ho We are making merry once again Greetings. The frail viola's Stem broke My chagrin knows no... Laudetur. "You prepare a meal for me in the presence of my enemies. "My cup overflows." The wind howls "As I walk through valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, "for you are with me. You prepare a meal for me "in the presence of my enemies. My cup overflows. "Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life." The wind howls Over Késmárk My dear country Farewell Follow me, soldiers! Follow me, Hungarians! Soldiers! Hungarians! Forward! The great Miklós Bercsényi Is weeping by himself He has No soldiers left I swear by the Holy Crown of Hungary that I will pass judgment in good faith with a clear heart, uninfluenced by passion, in sober consideration of the law. I swear. So help me God, I shall have no mercy for the enemies of our kind. - So I swear. - We swear. Bring him to me. "Who is it you want? "I told you that I am he. "I have spoken openly to the world, I said nothing in secret. "You did not lay a hand on me then. "But this is your hour, when darkness reigns. "The reason I came into the world is to testify to the truth. "Everyone on the side of truth listens to me." I accuse you of betraying our 1000-year-old Holy Country. Do you understand? Quod est veritas? "For false messiahs will appear and perform great signs and wonders "to deceive, if possible, even the elect. "Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather." "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. "There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. "Then you will be put to death, "and you will be hated by all nations. "But they shall proceed no further: "for their folly shall be manifest unto all men. "There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, "or hidden that will not be made known. "I tell you, he will see that they get justice." "Because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law. They set up kings without my consent, they choose princes without my approval. The days of reckoning are at hand. Because your sins are so many and your hostility so great, the prophet is considered a fool, the inspired person a maniac. The rebels are knee-deep in slaughter. I will discipline all of them. Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field." "My joy is now complete. "The one who comes from above is above all; "Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful." "This is what the Lord Almighty says: I appointed you ruler over my people. "I have been with you wherever you have gone, "and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. "Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth. "I will also subdue all your enemies. "I declare to you that the Lord will build a house for you."
