Smile. Okay, eat. What? It's Yulduz. Answer it. Hello? Yulduz? Shower? "Menimcha"? "Dubcig"? Did... Did she fall? She did? Is she okay now? Yulduz! Okay, bye. She's been in Turkey for eight years! What the hell is "menimcha"? Good job, buddy. Good job. This will calm him down. - Huh... It's Yulduz. - Yulduz? What is it, Yulduz? What? I don't understand. Is my grandmother okay, Yulduz? Okay, I'm on my way. Please stop talking now, Yulduz. What are you doing, sir? I'm sorry, ma'am, but some things are more important than work. Are you crazy? My dog is waiting for you. I will report you to Mr. Levent. Do you hear me? Coming! Gökçe? Okay, calm down. Did you talk to Neziş? Who did you talk to? Okay, I'm on my way. I'll get the car. Gökçe, did you let Fatty know? Excuse me. Will I get my coffee at some point? Of course, ma'am. It normally doesn't take 20 minutes to get a coffee. But we have increased demand right now. Hello? Efsun, how are you? What's up? Yes. Okay, I understand. Okay. All right. No, I'm fine. I dropped the tray. Did you talk to Neziş? Is she okay? Who talked to her? Are you okay? Okay, I'm on my way. We will stay there, right? - Okay, much love, babe. - Are you sure you are okay? I'm great, ma'am. Did you take your shoes off again? Sit back. I'll drive. Hurry! We are going to Aunt Nezihe's place, okay? Yes. You will love Aunt Nezihe! Growing up, we used to stay with Neziş all summer. She cooked for us, played with us. My sweet Neziş! Emrah, I'll seriously beat you up. Come down right now. I'm telling you, Neziş is in bad shape. Then take your computer with you! Pack everything. Emrah! Come down. Right now! I'll be there in five. Stupid. DOG FOOD SERVICE I think it's over there. Or is it closed or something? Darling, maybe we should get her a dessert. Wait a second, darling. It says the flower shop is right here. It does say that, but... You didn't unload the dog food? How? I was in a hurry. - Hello? We are on our way. - Hello? We are on our way, sis. Okay, sweetie. We're going there directly. - Kisses, then! - Kisses. And... Is Emre coming? - I don't know. I didn't talk to Emre. - Is Emre coming, too? Beril, sweetie, is that you? Yes. Hi, Dolunay. You are so sweet! Hi! Do you know Emre? - I've heard so much but... - Bye, sis. What's going on? - What is it, baby? - Why did you hang up? Weren't you done? Were we? My God! Emrah, get up. Look at the sign! Look at the sign, you dingus! Ugh! You slept like a bear all day! EMRE'S HILL Get up, Emrah. We're here. Emrah, get up. We are here! Get the hell up! We are here! What an animal. Get the hell up. Yulduz. Neziş! Neziş! Yulduz? Neziş! Neziş! - Got you! - Neziş, you! Are you crazy? How long did you stay like that? I didn't. I'm not crazy, you know. I was shelling some beans, heard you come in and did it. You are an incredible woman. We were scared shitless. It's nothing, sweetie. Everybody is calling each other. Yulduz said some things. - No, I just fell down. I'm okay. - How did you fall? I don't know... I was cooking... I lost my balance and fell. I'm healthy as an ox. I can even tumble. Just don't come tumbling down. Tell me, what is it? It's nothing. I'm just... I guess it's something, but I don't know what. It's not much, though. What a clear way to put it! Bravo, Neziş! Ask Yulduz, she explains it better. Yes, I bet she does! Aunt Nezihe... I called you "aunt," putting a great distance between us, - so take me seriously. - Don't, sweetie. Don't call me aunt. Ask away. - What's going on? - I have a bad heart. I was cooking and fainted. Yulduz called the doctor and then called you guys as well. It's not the first time anyway. Where is Yulduz? She's driving the doctor to town and getting my meds. I'm fine! Why won't anybody listen? Okay, then, all right. The show is over. But they will all come soon. - I will cook, don't worry. - You? Someone will. Maybe Yulduz. You are definitely not the one to do it. Hello, Auntie Nezihe. Emrah! Come in. Oh, wow! I must be in critical condition if even he came. I didn't want to miss the chance to face the fact of death. That's it! That's the spirit of youth! Dolunay and her husband are here. Granny! My pumpkin! You look good! I'm so glad! Crazy Yulduz called you all. I'm glad she did. What's up? - You are so cute. - How are you? - Hi. - How are you? - I'm fine. You? - I'm fine as well. You got a call, too? What gives? "What gives?" I just wouldn't want to bother you. No, I'm not bothered. Okay. Gökçe and Beril are coming, they are on their way. Okay, great. We are all together. Awesome. All together! Let's go in! - Are you working out, Emrah? So handsome! - You grew so fast! - We have tzatziki. - Efsun is here! Efsun! Hey! I missed you so much! I missed you so much, too! - I missed you! - You, too! - How are you? - I'm great. How are you? - I'm fine. I haven't seen Baby. - Come. Oh, my, what is this beauty! - What are you, an angel? - He is something, isn't he? A small being. A minimal life form! They are all inside. How can I help? - You get the bags. - Okay. I will get Baby. We are here, Baby. Where is Candaş? He has dinner with Meltem tonight. - He's going to be late. - Which Meltem? You know, the actress. They used to work together. - His ex-girlfriend? - Oh, right, you know her. I mean, they dated two years. Yes. How is Neziş? You look so great! So beautiful! Neziş! Efsun! - How are you, girl? - I get to see the baby! Look at his smile! So cheerful! - He is so cute! - Incredible. I get to see this handsome baby at last! I'm so sorry, Neziş. We didn't get the chance to bring him. I understand, sweetie. I know how it is to raise a kid. I'm still sorry. - Nonsense. And what's his name? - We call him Baby. - You don't know? - Know what? It's nothing. His official name is Mehmet. But he will get to decide when he grows up. - Decide what? - His name. Oh, you are so wild! I love you guys! Look at his charm! You look so manly! Yes, you. - We don't say that, though. - Say what? Compliments regarding gender. We don't think he deserves praise just for being male. Okay. Is Candaş coming? Candaş has dinner with Meltem tonight. He will come later. Meltem? Yes, you know, Meltem. The ex Meltem? - Yes. - Oh, my! - What do you mean? - I mean, what gives? It's just dinner. Okay. You look great! You look stunning! Where is this doctor already, Yulduz? She says he's coming. The doctor should be more attentive. I mean, doctors prioritize the patients who have a higher chance to live. - Probably why Neziş is not a priority. - He's right. Emrah, I think some things are not to be joked about. I disagree. I'm with Emrah here. Welcome! Hi! - Neziş! - How are you, Gökçe? My dear! Come here, Gökçe! - I missed you so much. - Me, too. Are you okay? I'm great. This is just a cry for attention. I wouldn't be surprised! Granny, look, Beril brought such beautiful flowers. Oh, you shouldn't have. But I love yellow flowers! I'm so glad you liked it. Hello. Welcome, please, sit. I couldn't reach Mom and Dad. Where are they? They are on a cruise, so we didn't call them. - Right, on a cruise. - Yes. How are you? Fine, and how are you? It's so great to see you. Beril, have you met Efsun? I've heard a great deal, but no. Hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. - You, too. Is this all of us, sis? No, Mesut is out on the yard with the baby. Candaş is coming tonight. Emrah is behind you. No way, Emrah! You have grown so much! He looks even older than me! Only three people are left. Shut up! He's not with us, he's too busy massacring. Hi. Hi, Fatty, how are you? How... I'm fine, how are you? I'm doing well. How are you? I'm fine. We are here for Neziş, all together. - Did you two meet? - No, we haven't. Hello, I'm Emre. Oh? Hi, Emre. I'm Beril. Nice to meet you, Beril. Darling, you know Emre, my best friend. I talk about her all the time. Yes, you have talked about her a lot. It's so nice to meet you. I have never seen this pool this clean. It's been years, yes. I got sick of it, it looked depressing. I had it cleaned. Great thinking, Neziş. Is there a spare swimsuit? I see swimsuits everywhere in the house. They must belong to you all. Who else's, right? Mesut! - Don't drop the baby! - Don't worry, he's fine. Let's swim. No, I'm too old. Neziş! Don't say that! Exactly. Oh, you guys! Sorry that you had to drive all the way here. Yulduz called everyone, causing chaos. But look at me, I'm healthy as an ox. We see that you are healthy. But it's nice to be all together. It's great. My Harry Potter! Beril, my dear, she and Dolunay were wrestling again one day and she hit her head on the radiator really badly. Hence the scar. She was basically hot pressed to the radiator. We thought the idiot was dead. How would you know? If I remember correctly, once you saw the blood... you passed out! You all stayed here? Their parents used to drop them off at the start of the summer, and we would spend three months together. But after puberty, they refused to leave Istanbul. And I was forgotten! - No! - Come on! Okay, fine, just a joke. Are you from around here, Aunt Nezihe? Practically. What? How should I explain? I was born and raised in Istanbul. This lot was my mother's. Once the kids went off to college, Semih and I decided to just go away. We were suffocating in Istanbul. We came here and built this beautiful house. It's really beautiful. Thank you. I studied architecture, after all. But I had Haluk at a very young age, so I never got to work. It's so great that we have something in common. What? I'm an architect. Oh, right! Why didn't you say that sooner? - Is she? - Yes. That's so great! But I didn't get to work as an architect. The only thing I built was my own house. Kismet. But this one is already your masterpiece. Thank you. Click, click! Taking photos without notifying us! She really should give a heads-up. We all look weird in the photos now. Wait a second. Let's do... Let's all gather around Neziş. Gather around her. Yes. - Go on. - Stand next to her. - Come. - Emrah, don't make me repeat myself. Just come here. Why do I have to say it ten times and scold you? My precious. - Are you ready? I'm setting it. - Ready. - Done. - Come on, quick! All together. Deathbed! Deathbed! - This is so nice, kids. - Yes, it is. Do you still get together each year? Yeah, do you get together each year? Because I haven't been invited... these past five years or so. Why not? - What happened? - Everything went blurry for a second. - What happened? - Are you okay? - Can someone... - Let's get her to bed. - Come here. - Is she okay? - Why did that happen? - Mesut! It's pretty good. - Now, please try to rest. - Okay. - Thank you very much. - Of course. What? "Sleep will heal her," she says. I'm fine. Right... You know, she's had two prior heart attacks. It's dangerous. But Nezihe has never been good at resting. She always moves around. Restlessly. Let's keep her under observation for a few days. But wouldn't it be better for her to be in a hospital? Actually... a hospital is not much better than this. And frankly, there is no room at the hospital for such a patient. What do you mean, "for such a patient"? Be clear. Spend some time with her. I don't want to say that these are her last days. But she is tired. Really tired. You all know her, right? She will do everything she can to hide all this. But her behavior doesn't reflect reality. I suggest that you stay for a few days. And we will see what happens, okay? Is she dead? What a brat! Idiot. - Gökçe. - Yes? - You get the room at the back. - Okay. Get the queen size bed sheet - that's on top of the cupboard. Okay? - Okay. - Emre. - Yes? Yulduz prepared a shakedown for you and Emrah in the small room. The small room? You know, the small room. The one where they put water jugs and pickle jars? I didn't see any pickles but I did see jugs, yes. The storage room. The one on the left right after the entrance, the little room. What little room? Can you put the bed sheet on, baby? - Please! - Come on, Gökçe. Okay. - Do you want the pillow? - Sure. What is that? I have no idea. Glass shards, I think. Where did it come from? I don't know. - Dolunay must have... - Where have you been? - What? - What have you been doing? What have I been... I mean... I turned in on myself a bit. Writing and stuff. You've been writing? What? I'm writing a book, and I'm... - running a café. - You run a café? - Wow, that's great. - Yeah. Don't act surprised. You watch my stories, Gökçe, I see your name, you know. I watch them, but I didn't know you were running it. Yes, it's going well. Great. How long has it been? What? With Berna. Emre! It's Beril. Oh, sorry. I'm joking. How long has it been... A few months. Almost a year. - And it's going well? - Yes. And she is so cute. Yes, incredibly cute. Yes, very. I like her very much. - What a civil, progressive event! - Idiot. - What are you talking about? - I congratulate you two. This is civility. Ex-girlfriend praising the new girlfriend. - Oh, fuck off! - You dumbass! We never dated! I would have to have dated him to be his ex, you know? - We didn't date. - When did we? We didn't. I'm so very convinced right now. Okay. - Dumbass. - Idiot. He's stupid. He will never amount to anything. - No, he will not. Idiot. - He is an idiot. Careful, Yulduz. Thank you. Gökçe was supposed to get these, but you know Gökçe! You all are old friends, it's so nice! Yes, Efsun and I were deskmates, for example. From primary school to high school. And Emre... No, Emre was Gökçe's... deskmate. Our parents used to send us here for the whole summer. We all grew up together. Emre and Gökçe were very... close friends. I'll go give these to Mesut. Okay. What kind of room is this? Are we going to get waterboarded? Get up. Let's put these sheets on. Why? I don't know why. Storage room for you, and for your ex... honeymoon suite. My what? Okay, okay. Hey, Emrah, look at me! - He is my childhood friend. - Okay. They have been going out for months! Shut up. All right, fine. Don't you dare humiliate me! You don't need me to be humiliated. You can do it all on your own, girl! - Get up. I'll sleep there. - No way! - I'll take it! - I'm already here. I'm your big sister! I'll take that spot. - Sleep there, big sister. Go on. - Get up! Good night. Sleep tight, big sister. Don't touch me! Idiot. Good night. Is that all? What? Aren't we going to talk at all? About what? I don't know... Like, what exactly is your deal with Emre? My deal with Emre? We are best friends, that's all. Gökçe, don't treat me like I'm stupid. - Whoa! - "Whoa" what? Your best friend Emre turned out to be a woman. And? I'm not even talking about your weird attitude. What weird attitude, baby? Have I said anything like this before? No. Why are you treating me like I'm jealous? Okay, I'm not. You never introduced me to Emre. I never introduce you to my friends. No, that's not what I meant. But even with Dolunay, we had dinner, like, what, a year ago? So what? What exactly are you saying? You are acting like I purposely hid the fact that Emre is a girl. Should I have said, "Emre is a girl"? You talk about Şule. - I never asked you if Şule is a man. - I mean... You saw a lot of her photos! Also, I doubt that there is a man named Şule. - I bet there aren't many women named Emre. - I know! So? What... Can you tell me what it is? Neziş told the story. We grew up here together. And nothing else? And we dated for a very short time. Back in high school, though. We just held hands. You know, high school. Why do you call her "Fatty"? She was a fatty. You are telling me the truth, right? Of course I am. I love you so much. I love you, too. Good night. Good night. Whoa, Yulduz, how are you carrying all that? Yulduz, let Mesut carry them for you. Is Baby asleep, Yulduz? Okay, thanks. - What did she say? - He's asleep. Bring some to Neziş, she says. And a glass of tea, Emrah. - Whoa! - Come again? And bring her an orange. - Efsun, can you pass the bread? - Here you go. Aunt Nezihe? What? You're the one serving me? I was chosen, for some reason. Good, do something on your own. Don't rely on being served. It's no problem. Just get better. You look well. Let's go swimming. - Swimming? - Let's swim in the pool. Are you crazy? I'm having breakfast. No death jokes? No. Enjoy your meal. Nezihe! Come to me! Come to the light! You are crazy! Where is Candaş? He hasn't come yet? No, he had a... They drank too much so he slept at Meltem's. But he is on his way. Candaş? My husband. Ask about Meltem now. Meltem is Candaş's friend. His ex-girlfriend. - How is that relevant? - What? - That she is his ex-girlfriend? - Seriously, so irrelevant. Can you all drop this civility act? I'm sure you also find it weird that he is spending the night with his ex. No one else is as shocked as you, that's for sure. Candaş is my husband. Meltem is his ex-girlfriend. They went out to dinner and drank too much. Candaş did not want to drink and drive, so spent the night at her place. Mesut, don't you ever stay with friends? No, he doesn't. Are you not allowed? Exactly. Is this how you make sure you don't get cheated on? What I think is... I think it makes more sense than letting my husband sleep with his ex-girlfriend. I don't think you understand men very well. Is Gökçe still asleep? No, he likes to sleep in. I know. We know. It's known. Go on, take a walk. Do something. No way, Grandma! We are all here for you. My pumpkin! I'm fine. Uh... Aunt Nezihe... - Ms. Nezihe... - Just call me Neziş, sweetie. Neziş, we are so happy with you here. Right, guys? So sweet. Thank you very much, Beril. I'm so bored. Like a funeral home! What? It's true! Everybody is so calm and silent. Oh, right, you can go to the beach. Let Baby get some fresh air. He's all cooped up in the house. Get some iodine... Oh, for God's sake, take a hike! Please, for the love of God! Can I help with the baby? Sure. Put Baby in his seat. And buckle him up. - Back seat or trunk? - Trunk. Okay, thanks, Yulduz. Should we take our car? No need. We can all fit in mine. Come on. Come on, Dolunay. - Are we taking your car? - Yes. - Coming. - And close the trunk. I'll close it, okay. You cutie pie! We are going! We are going to the beach. - What about us? - How will we go? We will get Emrah and follow you there. - Okay. - Don't be absurd! - Why would that be absurd? - To the beach, right? Should we take my car? Let's go with 24/7 Dog Food Service. And stop fooling people, claiming to be a veterinarian. Still with this nonsense? I am a veterinarian. Emrah! We're going! I'm not going! Okay. Stop it. Are you playing with keys? Are you going to be a realtor when you grow up? How cute you are! You are so... So, Beril, my dear, how is it going with you guys? How is what going? You and Gökçe, I mean. It's been a while. Yes. Our second anniversary is next week. Wow, two years? Any plans to get married? What is it to you, Dolunay? That's their private life. I'm just asking! Gökçe is so secretive! Gökçe is not secretive, he is a normal guy. What is it, Efsun? Why are you trying to insult me again? Nothing. I'm not insulting you at all. I just don't like violations of privacy. And since you do it all the time, you think I'm insulting you. No, it's more than okay. Actually, yes. We have been thinking about getting married this year. I closed my doors and windows Locked all of them up To overcome my love for you I tried all with which I could come up But to no avail My heart doesn't listen to anything I tell Love has overtaken me I need to escape this spell Stop being stubborn Get close to me We are as deep in love As anybody could be This is what love is Such a strong emotion Whoever believes in it Ends up in this commotion - Stop being... - Where have you been? The same question again? - You just haven't been around. - I haven't been around? Gökçe, I'm here. Look, Gökçe, you want to stay away and I respect it. I'm doing what you said. We see each other whenever you want. Why would I stay away from you? You say, "I get confused." That's why. Oh, boy! No way! - That was a century ago! - Okay. - Fine, all right. - Why would I be confused? We're friends. We can see each other all the time if you can keep it together. - No problem at all. - What nonsense is this? Okay, I'm not saying anything. You must have liked it so much, still talking about it! Yes, I liked it a lot, Gökçe! Being alienated by my closest friends for five years has been a great experience, Gökçe! Perfect! You attribute too much meaning to yourself. Please. Don't say anything stupid to Beril. I don't want her to get the wrong idea. - I won't, don't worry. - Yeah, sure! "I was alienated, not invited!" Right! Enough! Isn't it true, for God's sake? Did you invite me? No. Please relax. I see that you are afraid. Don't be. I won't say a word. - I'm not afraid. - You are. I see it. I love Beril very much, that's what I'm telling you. Stop the car. What? We are alone, this is our only chance. Pull over. - What? - Will you stop it or not? - Sure? I will pull over. - Do it. Idiot! You took the bait! - No, I didn't. You... - That's what I meant - when I said keep it together. - You came on to me. Oh, come on now! "I love Beril..." I know you so well. I would never fall for it. Sure, buddy, okay! He pulled over immediately! What an idiot! So eager! Whatever you do... never fall in love with your best friend. - Of course. - Yes. Exactly. Oh, by the way... I don't want to meddle in your familial affairs, but... Nonsense! You are a part of the family. Thanks. I went into Neziş's room to turn off the lights yesterday. And? And I found some photos. Let me see. Look at that sea! We're here, Baby. Come. - I'll change my slippers. - Baby, come. - Come on, Baby. - Go to Mommy. Oh, my! This is perfect! And this tree... Do you hear the waves crashing? It's so beautiful. Is this your first time in the sea, Baby? - I got it! - Great, Dolunay, thanks. Come on, Baby. Beril, let me see that photo again. It's a curious thing. I'm looking closely but I just don't know him. Let me see. He's quite handsome. He doesn't even resemble anyone I know. They are here. - Ask Gökçe. - Sure, maybe he knows. Come on. Where is Emrah? He didn't want to come. - Gökçe? - Yes, sis? Take a look. Who is this? So, apparently... Beril found this in Neziş's drawer. So, my question to you is, what if Neziş has an obsession that we don't know about? Why do you think she is obsessed with him? I went in to turn off the lights. Her drawer was ajar and full of pictures of her with him. Photos of Neziş and the man, photos of him only... - Weird. - Who is this? I have no idea. I don't know him, either. Weird. Maybe that's why we are here. - What? - To bring Neziş and this man together. Maybe not, though. Listen. As far as I know... I mean, I haven't seen Neziş with anyone else after Grandpa died. No way. Me, neither. I don't want to upset you, but I think he predates your grandpa. Really? He must be someone special. She kept all his photos, as far as I can tell. She is your grandma. She may not want to share that with you. She shares everything with us, always. Can we find him? Maybe he is on social media, who knows? If he's still alive. How will we find his name? I think it's unlikely. - We could give it a try. - You think so? I think so, too. Let's investigate this. What do you say? - Let's unpack then. - He is so cute! Let's get the stuff from the trunk. - Order some food. - Okay. I don't think the dog can talk, honey. Mom, Dad, we miss you so much! Hi there, kids! You are all there together? - So nice. - How are you, Mom? I'm fine, my little bird. Why are you all together? We are all visiting Neziş. Why, though? We just missed her. Do we need a reason? I just hope everything is okay. We are in Italy, can't do much from here. He didn't say anything was wrong. Everything is fine. We are great. We just missed each other. Dad, I have a question. What is it? - Emre, is that you? - Hello! Hey, what are you guys doing there? Mom, I need to ask something to Dad. Just let me. - Sure, son. - Hi, Aunt Selma! Who the heck is that? - It's Beril, Mom. - So sorry, Beril. I didn't recognize you. - What did you do to your hair? - I just... I'm wearing it up. Dad, do you know him? Let me see. No. Who is he? We are asking you, Dad. I don't recognize him. Ask your grandma. - Okay, we will deal with it. - Ask her. She probably knows. Is that Efsun's Baby? Yes, it's Efsun's Baby. He's so big. How are you, kids? Efsun? Oh, how you have flourished in your own way! Oh, you... Gökçe... You are too lazy to grow up, son. It's not as scary as it seems, don't worry. What? Old age. - What is it? - It's okay. It's nothing. Just some lower back pain. Sure, it doesn't seem scary at all! I... I just don't know. That's what they say. I don't even know how old I am. In my mind, I'm the same age as you. I feel like I can do anything. I can jump, run... and get back on my feet if I fall down. But the reality is very different. My wrists are too weak to open a door. And the weirdest part is my face in the mirror. Sure, it's Nezihe's face. But the face of my grandmother Nezihe! If I have to be honest... as far as I can tell from the photos, your grandma is a tad bit more beautiful. No way! So, yeah... You have 20 more years to have fun with these jokes. Enjoy. Because one doesn't know their age until someone points it out. Am I among them? Among who? Sure, as if you don't understand! I'll be going now. You rest. People say dying in your sleep is the way to go. Sit down. We are talking. Okay. Do you know which one you are? That one. That dirty adolescent. It's going to take shape, grow and become so beautiful. Just like you. My dear! What happened to you? You are all grown up! Which car should I take? The same one? I'll pick up Candaş at the airport. Okay. I'll put this in the trunk. We need to go shopping, too. Yulduz can't cook for all of us. - All right, I can cook. - Okay, let's cook together. And I can help. Guys, can anybody hear me? There is no need. Beril and I will take care of it. Did you guys know that Emre is running a café? - What? - Miss Dolunay, people can change, just give them a chance. Okay, then. You prepare dinner tonight. Okay, I'll do it. Sure, Emre and I can prepare dinner. Sure, something... Okay, you go grocery shopping and we will pick up Candaş. Okay. And buy something to drink. We are celebrating Gökçe and Beril's decision to marry. Great. You just can't help it, can you? Congratulations. - Thank you so much! - Great news! I'm so glad you said it. And in such a short time... And such a huge decision... It must be love at first sight. I mean, is two years that short? Gökçe told me it was less than a year, but... - Really? - Nonsense. I told you, two years. What? A year and a few months, I said. I got it. Whatever, it's great news. - That's what's important. - Thank you so much. I must have heard the "a few months" part only. That's probably why. Great job, man! Bravo! Seriously! I never expected this of him. It's so shocking. So nice. We have something to celebrate now. No way! Emre is preparing dinner! Candaş and his bad jokes! Why are you so surprised? - What's going on? - Your big sister is cooking. Why? Are we a mass suicide cult? I mean, she's running a café, she can handle it. Café? Yes, she is. I am... running a café. Dolunay, Meltem says hi to you. - So funny! - Why? I can tell when people joke about me, Candaş. I'm not that stupid, you know? What joke? Meltem loves you. Oh, so sweet. I love her, too! Why did even I say all that? Say hi to her and kiss her for me. I was just zoned out. Have you heard this? It's a rad rap song. Emrah! You connected everything in the house, whatever we press, the TV starts playing sounds. Candaş, let me ask you, what is that horse thing? I'll do the creamy chicken. Let me do it as well. How? That's not how it works? Then I should... I'll make the soup. Okay, great. Right. Great. I'll make the soup. Emre, I know everything. I mean, Gökçe told me all about your history. And I don't want it to be a problem between us. I'm not narrow-minded, after all. I don't care about the past. Oh, great! Seriously. I'm relieved now. I'm so glad. Neziş is what's important now. - Exactly. Right on. - Yes. And you can remain friends after we get married. Thanks, you are so sweet. I mean, it's not like it was a big deal anyway. - Yes, it was so short. - I know. And then he cheated on me. It's nothing. We were kids. He cheated? I mean, what happened was... I had to go on a vacation with my dad for three weeks. I didn't have a choice. And when I got back... my best friend and Gökçe were... You know. But... we were kids back then. It's not... Did I hear that correctly? What did you hear? Did I cheat on you? Didn't you? You idiot. We had just started dating and you wanted to take a break and left. I had to because I was 16 years old. I didn't have a say. I had to go on a vacation with my dad. And then you... You know, with Melis... It's fine. You said you wanted a break! He was nagging me so much. So I must have just come up with something. Why would I want a break? It had been only a few weeks. Whatever. That's what I am saying. We were not together at the time. So I went out with Melis to spite you. - Okay, just let it go. - Let what go? Let's ask Efsun, she knows! Okay. Let's ask. Come on. - Ask. - I will. I'll be back, darling. Just a second. Efsun, do you remember why I went out with Melis? Who? Melis. Melis from senior year. This idiot took a break from me, so I dated Melis to spite her. Right? Senior year? I told you, remember? Why would I want a break? Maybe someone was waiting for you there. - Whoa there! - What? Disgusting! Let's ask Dolunay. She was older then. - She knows that I went with my dad. - Sure. - Come on, you idiot. - I'm in. Stupid. Dolunay! Dolunay! Dolunay, I went on a vacation with my dad for three weeks in senior year, right? What? This idiot says that I went to be with someone, so he went out with Melis! Are you two crazy? It's all in the past. Right. But... Where are you going? - I'm calling Kubilay. - Who? Kubi. You will see now. You are calling Kubilay? Why? Hello? How are you, Kubi? It's Gökçe from high school. This is crazy. Thanks. I have a question. In senior year, why did I go out with Melis? To spite Emre, right? Exactly. Thank you so much. I'll talk to you later. Say hi to Aslı for me. Really? My condolences, brother. Thank you again. See? He said the same! - He just remembers what you told him. - Shut up! - This has gone on long enough! - What? Here's the gist, I had to go on a vacation and you, being a jackass, cheated on me. - No fucking way! - Fuck off! You fucking... - I'm calling Gülçin! - Do it! - I'm calling her. You are so... - Fine, do it. - I am calling her! - Kids! When will we eat dinner? Come on. I'm so sorry. You have every right to be upset, but it's not what you think. What do I think? What is it, then? You think I'm confused by Emre. No. What do you think? That it's me that you are confused by. Because you seem very clear about her. It's really not like that. We were being childish, got carried away. Both of us just wanted to be proven right. It was childish. I'm sorry. I'm completely clear. You make me feel so worthless sometimes. I know. I know. Water, anyone? - Me. - Give me your glass. MELTEM ARE YOU WITH EFSUN? YES, SHE'S RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I'M SENDING A PHOTO. DON'T LET HER SEE. SEND IT. - Candaş! - What? Put down your phone, man. Oh, here's soup. Here's the soup. All right. Enjoy, everyone. Here you go. Is this all? Oh, I forgot yours. - Bon appétit. - Thank you. What the hell is this? It's soup. Emre, I seriously don't know what you serve your customers in your café, but... Oh, Dolunay! Efsun, I'm seriously on the verge of vomiting right now. Well, let me save you, Dolunay. Let me take it back. Don't touch anything, we will take care of it. Okay. Is everybody okay? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Calm down... I'm calm, sis. Yeah, right! Oh, it's cold. Gökçe, listen. Emre is your friend. I don't know how many more of your relationships you will ruin. But if you are going to ruin it, do it right now. Go and tell Beril, "I love Emre, not you." I feel so bad for her. She looks at you with loving eyes. You know I like Emre, too. But this has gone far enough. It's a weird situation. She knows that you are obsessed and she's trying to confuse you. And when will you give up all this stupidity? I don't understand. - Sis! - Real love doesn't exist. No. Seriously. Just our obsessions. Listen to what I'm saying. Just marry Beril. Why are you blabbering about marriage? I don't look at marriage that way. "I should just marry whomever!" That's not me! Do you want me to end up in a shitty marriage like yours? Can you pass the olives? Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Where is Beril? She took off on foot with her luggage. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Stop. It was a joke. Come on. Very funny, you idiot! I found it funny! She's jogging. If I may ask, what is Candaş doing there? He's chopping wood. At this time of the year? It still looks sexy, just let him be. Where is Grandma, sis? She's resting in her room. Is she okay? Let Efsun answer that. She was better yesterday. Oh, also, Dad called. - The man in the photo is Tunç Çelikkol. - Who? Grandma and Grandpa's closest friend. We'd know him if they were so close. They were estranged. - No fucking way! - What? Their closest friend? "Never fall in love with your best friend." What is that? We thought these two would marry each other when they grew up. - Everybody thought that. - And? Neziş told us off like never before. What do you mean? Your stupid sister... You fell off the bike, right? Her knee was bleeding, I was kissing her. Gross story so far. Then Neziş scolded us, saying, "Never fall in love with your best friend." Could this be true? Is her true love Tunç Çelikkol? But then she would have said the opposite, right? But she didn't get to be with her true love and she lost her best friend. She's blaming herself. - Poor thing. - Yeah. Some shit is happening but I don't understand it. What if... Can we find this Tunç Çelikkol guy? Wow. I can't believe it! This really is our reason to be here. I can't believe it either, darling. He isn't on Instagram or Twitter. Emrah, you should check Facebook, not Instagram. So this is her real love? That's our best guess, yes. It really seems like it. - Aha! - What is it? He's dead. We lost him? How could this be? Is it really surprising, Dolunay? He's 100. Old people die, they're not born. - Should we tell Neziş? - No! I mean, why would we tell her? I agree with Beril. Let's not ruin the thought of her love. Gah! You aren't going to stay here forever, right? Are you bored of us already? I mean... Hey! Are you really bored? No, but... Go out, get some fresh air. It would be a nice chance. Where would we go here? It's late. Oh, come on. This isn't the middle of nowhere! There are lots of places and pubs. Go out, recharge. And don't you all have jobs to go back to? We can think of all that after you are all better. I can stay. I'm also free. My God! My sweet kids, I've lived here without you for years. And... I'm grateful, you are so sweet, but... I'm not dead, after all. I don't like these jokes, Neziş. Okay, fine! Just go out and have some fun, okay? Have fun like the old days, show everybody how it's done! She's still taking photos! And he's lying here like a whale! I don't feel well! Okay, Yulduz. I'm glad she fell asleep. Thanks. Good night! This place looks so nice and fancy! Don't anybody dare sing karaoke. Let's leave this stupid place after ten minutes. Take this money and stop complaining. And then says to him "Wow, sir, you are also..." Listen. A bunch of dill and a pair of leather pants are in the same bag. And they say, "How come we are here together?" I'm confused, I'm panicking I'm dreaming Don't even ask Like lovers in novels Can one really love so much? Is what we have Only a temporary fling? Or will it last forever? Is it really short-lived Like hay on fire? Is love really that expendable? No novels or history There is nothing That remains standing To be as courageous As all lovers Is love really that expendable? Let's go back to our table. Let's go! Is love really that... One black coffee and a water, please. - You're flushed, right? - Yes, it's so hot in here. Oh, no. Even if you are not by my side Even if you are not with me Even though I try to fight it I live with your image Even if you are not by my side Even if you are not with me Even though I try to fight it I live with your image I find you on the roads I steal you from calendars I dance with your image And so I live with your image Moss is hidden in the sea The sea, in the color blue In your blue eyes It's impossible to forget you Rain is hidden in the clouds The cloud, in the color white In your white skin It's impossible to forget you Wheat... Wheat is hidden in its ear Wheat, in the color yellow In your blonde hair It's impossible to forget you - I'm nauseous. - Car. Bill. Let's go. Let's go now. Can you get our car? What the hell, Gökçe? Do you realize the position that you put me in? Am I competing with Emre over who gets to have you? - Why would you say that, baby? - "Why?" - Who was that song for? - For you, of course. Who else? Let's see, then... My hair does not look like wheat. My skin is not the color of clouds. And my eyes are not blue! It's just a love song. It can't match every person. I was just being cute. I can't believe this! I need fresh air. I'm going outside. Get out of my way. What are you doing? What am I doing, Gökçe? Was that song for me? Yeah, sure! Everything is about you, right? I should be the one asking that question. I don't want this anymore. Then you can leave. Just fuck off, the door is there. You... What? Why don't we give it a try? What are we scared of? I don't get it. "Never fall in love with your best friend" has become our motto, and we are living aimlessly. But we don't even know what it means. I want to try. Let's see what happens. If we fuck it up, we fuck it up. But we will have given it a try. Let's not lie to ourselves anymore. Idiot! You imbecile! This is my revenge for what you did in the car! - How does it feel? - Idiot! Fuck off! Idiot. Beril... Gökçe and I, we are... We are still kids. I just want you to know this: there is absolutely nothing between us. And there never will be. Emre, just fuck off. What's going on? What's going on? Let's go. I don't know. Emre's Hill was clear. Calm down. - Where is her car, then? - It's fine. She'll come right back. Emre! - Maybe she is upstairs. - She is not home. What are you doing? - I'll go check. - Where? - She's drunk driving! - Oh, poor thing! What, Beril, what are you saying? What is all this fuss? Something called "Emre's Hill" and such. What is this? - Hello? Where are you? - My God! What do you mean Emre's Hill? We were just there. Are you okay? Okay, I'm on my way. Make a decision, Gökçe. - What decision? - What do you want from me? Beril, she had an accident! Is this the time? Yes, it is! What don't you like about me? What did I do? - Where did that come from? - Where, you ask? Your best friend Emre turned out to be a girl! - So? - On top of it, she's your ex-girlfriend. On top of all that, she's the love of your life, obviously! I treat your grandma well and get treated like a suck-up! I lost my father three months ago, yet I'm here for you. Do you think it's easy? But I'm "boring" or something... I'm always something! Are you going to compare me to Emre? Okay! Maybe I'm not as crazy as her. I'm not as beautiful. I don't know! Finish your comparison! I'm tired of it, Gökçe! If you love Emre, just let me go. Do you want to make sure? Do you not want to take a risk? Then go ask Emre. If she's also in love, then congratulations. But if she isn't, come back and let's move on. Really? Fuck off! Idiot! - Beril, dear... - Beril. - Please hold on. - Calm down, Beril. Just stop. - "Calm down"? - Come, sit. How can I calm down? What am I? Right now, all we know is that you are right. Beril, dear, please calm down. They are both kids. I shouldn't stand in their way, then. But that's impossible. Think of it as some stupid shenanigan, remnant of their childhood. They couldn't even be sweethearts and succeed at it. Gah! I... She tried to talk to me and I told her to fuck off, and she got into an accident. - Are you blaming yourself? Nonsense! - But I mean... - What if she's not okay? - I'm sure she is. She drove off the road at Emre's Hill. What is this Emre's Hill? Why is everything a code with you? Emre's Hill is a hill named after Emre. - And? So? - So... It all started back when Emre was eight or ten years old. And since Emre isn't one to learn from her own mistakes, the second incident followed a year later. And it continued. And Neziş had to intervene. EMRE'S HILL Emre! Emre! Emre! Emre! Emre! - Emre, are you okay? - Gökçe. - Are you okay? - My shoe fell off. - I was so scared. - But I'm fine. - I love you so much. - I love you, too. - For real? - Of course for real, are you stupid? I swear this one isn't a joke. I love you so much. I love you, too. - My shoe and my gummy bears. - I'll get them. - Are you in pain? - I'm... Just a little. What now? Turn towards me. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - Should we go to a hospital? - Hospital? Why? What for? "Why?" she says! Stop! God has sent you! - Stop. Okay, I found it. - What is it? - Do you have neutered? - What? Food for neutered dogs. I'll call you back. Are you kidding me? I thought it was an emergency. It is an emergency. I'm asking for neutered dog food. We've had an accident! - I'm sorry. - Thanks. Isn't this a 24/7 dog food service? It says so right here. I would sell it to you if I had a receipt, but I don't. Boy, just give me some dog food. How hard is that? Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What happened to you? What happened? Nothing. - Hey! - Where should I put her? - Candaş, may I? - What happened, Gökçe? - Are you crazy? You brought her here? - She wasn't like this. - Emre? What happened to her head? - How many fingers am I holding? Emre? what happened? Candaş, Baby is alone upstairs, go. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Gökçe, the doctor is upstairs. Get him. - Doctor! - Do you understand us? She's sleeping. I came to check on her, but you being here is also very helpful. And it... What the fuck happened? Move! Stand back. Emre? - Doctor. - Are you okay? I'm doing well. Follow my finger now. Slowly. Good. Let's start with Emre. I had to put in three staples. She's not in critical condition but she is in shock. Or just drunk. I can't tell the difference. But I don't think it's serious. And it was a mistake to bring her here in this condition. She was well when I found her. I'm a man of medicine as well. Right, sis? Okay. She's fine, anyway. About Nezihe... She is still in the same condition. Some days she is well, and some days bad. It hasn't worsened like I predicted, but it hasn't improved either. I feel like I'm talking to my uncle right now. Isn't there a medical term, something more technical? Huh, Doctor? - Emrah... - What? It's okay. It's fine. I'll be going now. Emre, are you okay? I'm all better now. That's good. But don't sleep tonight. Don't let her fall sleep tonight. Okay? Okay, we won't. Slowly. - Do you want a pillow? - Yes, my head is not... - Give me the pillow, Gökçe. - Here. - My head is not comfortable. - Okay. Thank you. - Tell me if you feel any pain, okay? - Okay, thanks. Feels like an endless day. It really does. What happens to the car? Scrap. Is it in the same place? Yes. Nobody can find it there. We should get a tow truck in the morning. I can take care of it. - No need. Mesut will. - Sure. Dolunay... - Why are you talking on behalf of Mesut? - Efsun... I just want you to rest and be comfortable. - Mesut will take care of it. - I am comfortable, Dolunay. If you want to do it yourself, say so. Don't talk on his behalf. This is between me and him. Don't meddle in our affairs. That's what we keep telling you. Is Emre okay? - Emre? - Get up. - Get up! We are here for you! - What the hell! She's alive. What the hell? Are you okay? Give me a second. Emre, you need to stay awake. Sure you don't want coffee? Yes. I don't. Thanks. Some bad things lead to good things after all. Like what? I mean the accident. What's good about it? Don't you remember? Remember what? I was there... I don't remember that stuff very well. What happened exactly? Are you fucking with me? What now? Can we leave in the morning? I really should get back. I will lose my job... otherwise. What do you mean lose your job? Don't you own the place? I told you that you didn't need me. I'm a waitress, okay? I earn my living waiting tables. Okay? I'm a waitress. Okay. So... Are we leaving tomorrow? I understand that nobody wants to be the first one to say yes. But I also know that you want to leave. And Neziş is fine, despite our efforts! She's not dying. We can go. - Oh, Emrah! - What? I just want to go home, okay? Should we hold a pillow over her face? Should I feed her glass shards to make her die slowly? What? What the hell are you talking about, Emrah? Dolunay, please stop the yelling. I'm trying to hold on to life here. "Hold on to life!" What a showman you are! Stop exaggerating, Emre! You have put her through hell already! What does that have to do with me? Don't you get it? Tell her, Beril, tell her everything. I told you off and then you had an accident... I just felt guilty, you know, like I was in the wrong. This is how good she is. She is good! - What do you mean? - I mean she is a good person! Then what is she doing here? She should go to heaven. - What the hell? - What's with all this yelling? Can everybody please calm down? Be quiet. Neziş is sleeping upstairs. Why do you hate me so much? - Hate? What? - God! I hold my tongue and don't react to your bullshit just to make Neziş happy. I want to go. Nobody is listening to me. - Let me go! - Darling, calm down. Stop with this "darling" bullshit! Can someone please give me a ride to the airport or the terminal? - I just want to go. - Beril, don't go! Beril. Don't go. I'm sorry. I understand my mistake. I know what I want. I don't need any confirmation from anyone. Don't go. Gökçe, stop your bullshit already! I'm sick of this! So, are we going? Emrah, for the love of God, please just get on your computer. Okay, Mom! What did you just call me? - So what? - Dolunay, what's going on? - Too loud! - Why did you call me "Mom"? - He didn't insult you. - Okay, Candaş. Come, Dolunay. - Don't... - Then she shouldn't act like my mom. - Then don't call me that! - Dolunay, calm down. Sis, give us some peace! Are you all crazy? Why are you all against me? We are not, Dolunay. But we are all adults here. You should calm down. Take it easy. I don't see it that way, Efsun. How do you see it? - You are all children! - We are what? Children! Saying, "We are crazy! We are free! Oh, yeah!" - "Oh, yeah"? - "Oh, yeah," yes. - Candaş, stop it. Dolunay... - Hold on a second. Do I have to agree with you on everything? Treating me like I'm narrow-minded! I have my own opinions. Maybe I'm not as liberal as you are. I don't want your husband to sleep in another woman's apartment. - Still talking about that! - Yes, I am! So what? Maybe I respect traditional family values more than you do. - Since when? - What do you mean, Efsun? Since when do you respect traditional family values? You weren't like this before you panicked about not finding a husband. Forgetting your past doesn't erase it, my dear Dolita. We should ask the boys at our high school about how traditional you are. Okay? I'm sorry. Okay? And if you want to act like a mom, dear Dolunay, then have a baby. Right? Right, guys? I mean, come on... Where are you going? Don't. You should stay. Let's have a wedding right here. - Dolunay... - What happened, huh? Weren't we telling everything about everything? What happened, Gökçe? Let's go upstairs. Let's all dress up and put make-up on. Okay? You are lucky this time. Emre is at least here. This time you don't have to drive to Istanbul in your tuxedo. When the fuck was that? July, 2014. Take great care of yourselves, okay? Don't hurt each other's feelings. You are childhood friends. Troubles, difficulties, or life itself may get in the way. - Don't say that. - Everything is possible. We are all mortals. You are such a young girl, don't say such things. Stop making fun of me, Emrah! All right, then. Go, beat the traffic. Come here. All of you. Come on. My children! I love you all so much! Okay, have a good trip. Bye. You have kissed me a thousand times already. That's enough. Just go. Bye. Go on. And if Yulduz calls you again, don't pick up the phone! She's mental! She says, "Goodbye." This is a farewell in her culture. Enough! Okay. I wanted you to come. I told Yulduz to call you. I wanted to see you and I had the pool cleaned. I wanted to see you together one last time. But apparently, you cannot stay together. You jumped on each other after a few days. All right, go now. Goodbye. Have a good trip. I'm not angry! I'm not. I love you so much! - I don't believe this! - Neziş! That's enough, just go! Go, or I will... Come here. You had to talk, didn't you? Now your other hand. Take off your shirt. Candaş, can you get the phone? Okay. More serious. Look at me. What is it, Yulduz? I'm going to be honest. We have talked about this, IVF is a lengthy process. And in your case, our chances are low. But if you keep your hopes up, I think we will eventually succeed. Yulduz. Answer it. Yulduz? This will calm him down. But be careful, he gets on the offensive when he sees a needle. You wouldn't believe what we deal with. Come here. Yulduz is calling. I need to answer. "Yulduz," you said? Yulduz? I've been waiting for my cortado. It's coming right up, ma'am. Just after I get these... I'm fine. I'm okay. Yulduz? Oh, Yulduz! Yulduz was a shooting star, Mesut. Mesut! Beril, my dear. My condolences. Thank you. I'll kiss you and be on my way now. Nonsense. You have to come. I just wanted to see you, really. Let's have dinner one last time. Please don't say that! I'm the exact right age to be playing the sympathy card. I'm all alone now. Yulduz is gone. I'm so sorry, Neziş. I told her many times! I told her to slow down. She was working as if in a circus! I'm really sorry. You should stay tonight. Neziş was hit hard by Yulduz's death. I wish we could bring her Tunç Çelikkol. Now is not the time to talk about Tunç Çelikkol, Emrah. Maybe that would have made her happy. But he's dead. Nothing we can do. But Neziş doesn't know that. - So? - So what? We can do something. Like what? Remember the karaoke bar? Some guy kept talking to me. He added me on Instagram and such. Apparently, he was an actor in the municipal theater. Grandma? Grandma? Look who's here. Who? Mr. Tunç is here. Tunç? Is that you? Yes, Grandma. Tunç Çelikkol. Beril helped us track him down. We'll leave you alone now. You have a lot to talk about. Tunç? Nezihe? You call me "Nezihe" now? Since when? My Nezo! I've waited for you for years. I've looked at your pictures every day. I've been waiting for this, too. I've also looked at your pictures. But I knew you would come. I prepared myself for this day. I know exactly what to say. Go on, my Nezo. God damn you to hell. What kind of a person are you? Huh? Are you here to do the same thing? Are you here to make me fall in love with you again? Huh? Are you going to make me fall in love, impregnate me, and then leave? Oh, Miss... My Nezo... Don't call me "my Nezo" again! My son still thinks that another man was his father. He never knew his real father. You suddenly disappeared after a magical night. I had to convince my husband by saying, "You were drunk, that's why you don't remember." - It took me years to convince him. - Shut it! And after all these years, what do you want from me? A second baby? No, Miss... my Nezo... Of course not. Please... I'm in. If you are in, then I'm in. Tunç... Çelikkol. - Grandma! - What! I got you all! I'm so sorry, sir. Please forgive me. - What's going on, Grandma? - Oh... Yulduz told me that you were looking for Tunç Çelikkol. I never thought you would resort to such nonsense. But what exactly is going on? Thank you very much for everything, Beril. However... The man in the photo isn't Tunç. Who is it? I have no idea. What do you mean? I just don't know. That's why I kept those photos separately. I was trying to remember who he was. But no, I have no clue. Tunç Çelikkol? He's dead. It's been so long. He had heart disease, and was quite the womanizer. I suspect he went happy. What about "Never fall in love with your best friend"? What? What kind of a joke is this, Grandma? We went mad! Yours was even worse! I mean... What did you think? "Let her be happy one last time"? Oh, come on! Well, this was my joke. Are you okay? Get me the ginger thing. Gökçe, you stay. Sir... Please forgive me. What did you say, Grandma? I told you two to stay. Us? You, too, Emre. Come. I'm fine. I said, "Never fall in love with your best friend," huh? You can't find the answer, so you ask me for it, huh? You are all grown up. You are not children anymore. I don't have those answers. I'm sorry. You will decide for yourselves based on your own instincts. Okay, my sweet pumpkins? - Okay. - Well, then... Go now. Let's not run the rumor mill for nothing. Go. My sweet girl. It's not like I could figure it out. What? I said thank you. He looked nothing like him. But at least you tried. Stop it, Grandma. Stop joking. Kids, I'm old, not stupid. Why would I keep all his photos just because I don't recognize him? You really bought that? I expected more from you. So it was all true, right? Let me tell you a secret. But don't tell anyone. I don't want to mess with everybody's head on my way out. Nothing happened anyway. I was madly in love with him. And I think he was, too. But we never told each other. We kept it to ourselves. Then I married your grandfather. We loved each other very much and we were very happy. Tunç remained in my mind... only as a thought. "What if?" I wasn't going to tell this to anyone. But Beril figured it out, clever girl. She really is quite clever. I'm so tired. Go now. And don't forget... I love you very much. - We love you, too. - We love you. Oh, my Yulduz! My sweet Yulduz! I called Mom and Dad. I told them she's not well. Good thinking. Is she tired because of us? She's happy about it. Had a lot of fun. Don't worry. - Efsun, can I lie down? - Sure. Dolunay. Where is the doctor? I called him. He's on his way. It's not a medical issue. She's sad about Yulduz. - Very much so. - Yes. But that's Yulduz for you! She liked life the way she lived it. Something was bound to happen. Oh, how crazy are you? I'm still not dead, kids! - No way! - Grandma! Neziş is seriously my idol! She is literally insane! Look at us! - Can you take this to Neziş, Emrah? - Sure. And I can never tell when she is joking and when she isn't. I called Mom and Dad to tell them she's not well, and she jumped in the pool! - Tell them she was just joking. - I told them already. See, Beril? We were raised by an insane woman! We were all raised by her. That's the way we are. A bit crazy. Seriously, her will to live is unmatched! She loves life a lot. With all its ups and downs. What is it? Emrah? This is not a joke, right? ONE YEAR LATER We miss you so much, Neziş. She loved pink and purple flowers. - Oh, hey. - Hi. - Hi, Emre. How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? - Hi. I'm Kaan. - Hi, I'm Dolunay. Nice to meet you. - How are you? - What's up? Dolunay... I'm fine, you? - I'm fine, too. - Hello. - I'm Kaan. - Nice to meet you. How are you, Emrah? Oh, and I'm Gökçe. You are Gökçe? Sorry, I thought you were a girl. - I told you before. - Maybe I just forgot. That must be it. - Where is Beril? - I haven't seen her since the funeral. - I never called her. - Sorry to hear that. Then see you later, Neziş. Candaş and others should be done cooking. - At Neziş's? - Yes. Should we see this famous Emre's Hill before heading to Neziş's? Let's do it! Great idea! I never went back there after that fateful night. You mean the accident? Of course I mean the accident. What else could I mean? All right. Subtitle translation by
