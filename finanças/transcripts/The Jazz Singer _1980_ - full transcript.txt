He said you wouldn't pick us up. You called in the middle of the night, remember? The same phone that woke me woke him? Anyway... I'm glad it's out in the open. I never liked you sneaking around behind his back. Look, I better get back. What are you going to say to him? I'll explain. I'll tell Tillie. You go. Ok. Let's try one more time and... Pop, I want to explain to you about last night. So, explain. When I talk to the sergeant of police this morning, he said there was no Jesse Rabinovitch, only a Jess Robin. Why Robin? It's a name, pop. It's a professional name. I use it whenever I... you know, I... - Whenever you what? - I don't know. Pop, look, I have to be honest with you. I have been sneaking around and doing these kind of shows now for--for a long time. We need the extra money. What is so terrible? If it's not so terrible, why all the sneaking around? Because you do think it's terrible. And it is. You're a cantor. Assistant cantor, pop. For five generations, a cantor Rabinovitch has been singing in the synagogue. I sing in the synagogue, pop, for what?! For God. God doesn't pay so good, pop. Huh? This is a poor synagogue. They pay what they can, but I can't live on that. God doesn't pay so good? Rivka and I want our own place, we want to have babies. How can I afford that, pop? What do you want from god? You can never repay. Never! Never! All right, ok. Easy. Pop, just take it easy. I'm sorry I said it. I didn't mean it. please. You think it's an accident that you can sing? God gave you your voice for his use, not yours! All right, pop. I'm sorry. Just sit down, ok? Let me get you some schnapps. The rabbi told me he has complaints about you. You want to change this, you want to change that. Put more prayers into English. All right, pop. Come on, not now. Yes, now! There are some things is more important not to change! Our people were killed for saying a prayer a certain way. We owe it to them to keep on singing it... their way. You can't change what has always been! That's how you know where you stand... Who you are and where you come from. And if you don't know where you come from, how do you know where you're going? Ok, pop. I know who I am. I know what I have to do. Assistant cantor. Right now I'm going to go and shave. I'm going to change the music for shavuos. I'm going to make everybody happy. In your own words, Yussel, what's so terrible? Haven't seen you in a while. What's happening? Not much. I guess your old man's watching you like a hawk, huh? Right. What's happening with you? Oh, man. We got us a gig in L.A. Ooh, terrific. Tell me. Our crazy agent finally got up off his ass, man, and did something for us. Got us some back-up work. You know, Jess, you ought to come out there with us and take your shot. No, not this time, brother. This time I got to walk the straight and the narrow. Straight and the narrow? It's a pretty tough gig, man. Yeah, it's tough. Well, brother, I'm going to be out in L.A. Enjoying the sunshine. Getting your tan together? Yeah, right. Whoo! Ha ha ha ha! Good night! Good night, pop, good night. Bubba's going to California. Good. Well, I'll miss him. You know, you've got too much talent to waste on a music that doesn't mean anything. Rivey, it means something to me. Hey. I think pop is asleep. Honey? Hmm? Let's take a rain check, ok? Oh. Are things ok, Jess? Sure. Go to sleep. You've got it. You see the difference? Yeah. You're cool. Why do I have to sing this at my bar Mitzvah anyway? Why? Now, that's one of my favorite questions, too. Why don't you just... do it for your parents this time, ok? Sometimes you do it for your parents. I thought that was the whole idea of being bar mitzvahed. You're a man. You don't have to listen to your parents anymore. You've got a lot to learn, kiddo. All right, look, you have it. You know the words, you know the music. Just put yourself into it, ok? Yeah. I'll let you go home early today. Go out and play with your friends. Thanks, Jess. All right. I'll see you later. Bye. Good-bye. Hello, Rabbi. How are you? It's very exciting today. Yes, it is, it is. You singing at your father's party. 25 years he has been the cantor of our shul.

Rivey, do you know what it means to have a hit song and a hit album like that? I got to go. Honey, I want you to come with me. How can I go and... I have so much to do here. How can you go? Aren't you curious about what goes on out there? Why should I be? I have what I want. It's all here. Oh, Rivey, honey, it's two weeks. Why? You've been doing so beautifully. I'm so proud of you, Jess. Please? I've never seen your father so happy. Don't spoil it for him. Don't do that to him, please. If you're not going to think of me, think of him. Think of your father, Jess. Listen, I love my father. I'll never do anything to hurt him, but I'm going to L.A. with you or without you. I am going to L.A. Ha ha ha. Ahh! Leo and I have been remembering all sort of things. Harry Truman was a wonderful man. Without him, we would have all been nowhere. Leo, why don't you go ask Tillie to dance? I'm resting. Just go ask her to dance, please, Leo? There's no the music. Leo, please! Go ask Tillie to dance. I'm dancing. Oh, how I'd love to dance with your mother. Oh, she was so full of life. Ah.

You can get mugged in a recording studio. And, uh, the name's Rabinovitch. What is it? Love on the rocks by Jess Robin. The sound man gave it to me as a going away present. Nobody should sing your songs but you, Jess. So far, nobody has. Well, look, it's a tough business. Lennox is singing your song all wrong, but he is singing it. You'll make it. I knew it the moment I heard you in that recording studio. It might take a little while, but you'll make it. Well, I don't have a little while. I got fired today. I'm gonna go home. Jess, you were going to stay two weeks. Why don't you at least give yourself the two weeks? What can you do in two weeks? Yeah, you're right. It takes three weeks to become a superstar. To become a legend, at least a month. Well, I guess I'm out of luck then. Jess, why don't you stay? What have you got going for you back in New York? A job, for one thing. I really am a cantor. Come from a family of cantors. Five generations. Cantor Rabinovitch. So, now all of a sudden there's a Jess Robin. There's always been a Jess Robin... Ever since I was a kid. You know, the songs... that go through your head. I don't know. I guess I came out here To see if they were any good. See if I'm any good. I just don't want to go through life thinking... I could've been. My father did that. He wanted to be a concert pianist when he was young. Nobody listened to him. Nobody tried to help. So, after a while, he just played it safe, became a sound engineer. He was really good, too. I guess he died thinking, maybe I could've been. Well, supposing I was going to stay out here for a couple of weeks... you seem to know the ropes. I should. I've been knocked through them enough times. Well, what would I do? Well, the first thing you got to do is find somebody to handle you. You have to get somebody tough and smart, somebody who really cares about your talent. And they, whoever, they have to find out who's doing what and where and try to get you there ahead of everybody else. Well, I'm--I'm going to need a place to stay. I have an extra room. You can stay here with me. I'd have to let pop know, call Rivka. Rivka? My wife. Right. you can't stay here with me. Um, maybe you could stay with Bubba. And, like you said, I have to find someone who can handle me, someone who's tough and smart and... and someone who cares. Now, where am I going to find someone like that? Oh, well, I guess I've been out of work long enough. That's him. Eddie Gibbs. Books all the variety acts. Which one? The fat one. Look, he just lost the opening act For Zany Gray's one-nighter. Well, go get him. Well, thanks, Peg. I owe ya! Pretend you don't know me. I don't. Take my wallet. Just leave me my credit cards. Ok, you can have the credit cards. Turn on the radio.

He settled for a pizza. ♪ Hey, Ma Cherie ♪ ♪ If I take you home ♪ ♪ will you make me plead? ♪ ♪ My sweet amour ♪ ♪ If I come too close ♪ ♪ will you close the door? ♪ ♪ Oh, my Louise ♪ ♪ Do you know my name? ♪ ♪ I remember yours and I know what you need ♪ ♪ what you need, my Louise ♪ ♪ do it now! ♪ ♪ Yes! ♪ ♪ Hey, Ma Cherie ♪ ♪ If I take you home ♪ ♪ will you make me plead? ♪ ♪ Oh, Mon amour ♪ ♪ If I come too close ♪ ♪ will you close the door? ♪ ♪ Oh, my Louise ♪ ♪ Do you know my name? ♪ ♪ I remember yours... ♪ how can he leave all this?

I know very little about where he comes from, about you or the hold you all seem to have on him, but I know where he's going. Listen to him.

Why didn't you let me know? Aren't we going to say hello first? Come on, let's talk. - You were wonderful. - Thanks. Did you hear them? Was that audience great tonight? I couldn't believe it. I'm so happy you were here to see it. All night, you were wonderful. - Thanks, babe. - Really wonderful. Thanks. And that's some shirt you have on? Huh? Huh? You know, this is just one night, but we are on our way now. I wish pop were here to see this, huh? You don't need papa. You don't need anybody. You know what this means for us? Everything you ever wanted. Honey, everything we've ever wanted. I have everything now, Jess. You know I learned something out there. Those people love the music and I love doing it for them. I can't go back now. I'm just beginning. Not after tonight anyway, Rivey. I'm not asking you to. I wouldn't. - Hi. Hi. Hi! - Great show! - How are you? - Ok. Hang on just for a second. What do you mean? What are you saying? I guess that I always liked being married to a cantor. Rivey, did you ever think that there might be something in life that's just as thrilling? Like what? Like following a husband around from city to city, saying wow? I don't believe it. This is the biggest night of my life and you want to drag me back to Elridge Street. It's where we belong. It's what we are. I mean, maybe you can break away from it, but I don't want to. I should've taken you out of that apartment years ago. You sound like my father. I've always been like him. You're the one that's changed. You're damn right I've changed. I finally found out where I belong. It's not back there. It's here. But it's not where I belong. It's not what I want. Rivey, we've known each other most of our lives. Are you telling me that if I don't come back with you now, that's it, we're finished? Only if you can come home without any regrets. Can you do that, Jess? Rivey, home is you and me. Right now it's here. Come on, say hello to my friends. Hey, here he is, folks! The sweetest Robin. He's with all the records. Barney Callahan, I tell you, you were-- He wants to talk a record deal. Rivey! - He thinks you're mad. - What's going on here? Is something wrong? What can we do for you? You need anything? We got it all. We can do anything you want. You want a drink? You're a hard girl to get in touch with, you know that? What are you doing here? Eddie told me you were signing a big record deal this morning. I've been calling you for three days. All I get is an answering machine. Well, Tommy asked me if I wanted to go to Acapulco with him, so we were just getting the boat ready. Acapulco? Yeah, look, Jess, if there's some problem with the deal, you can just talk to Eddie. He's a great agent. There's no problem with the deal. The deal is fine. I just--I just wanted to talk to you. Well, so, talk. Well, I just wanted to tell you that, uh... Look, why don't we go out and get some lunch and... No, Jess, I don't think so. You're on your way now. I just thought I'd take a little vacation. Tommy, this is Jess. Jess, this is Tommy. Glad to meet you, Jess. Come on aboard. Have a beer? No, thank you. He seems like a nice fella. Yeah, he is. Terrific. Well, I guess, uh... I guess so. Thanks for everything... and have a good time in Acapulco. I will. Ok. Molly, hold it. Before you say anything, just let me finish what I have to say, ok? Rivey went to New York after the show. She went back home and, um, we finally figured out we didn't want the same things anymore and maybe we never did, but it's over. I'm sorry, Jess. I really am. Well, it's ok. I don't really want any sympathy. I just wanted to tell you that... while we were working together, I got to feel... that... well... I got to feel... Shit. Jess, what are you trying to say? Molly, what I've want to say to you is that... I don't want you going to Acapulco with him. I see. Tommy, would you be too disappointed if I didn't go to Acapulco with you? Acapulco? We're going to Catalina for the day. Oh, no. Hee hee hee. No, now, Jess! Jess, don't do that. You don't even know how to turn it on! Oh, no! No! Jess!

What a surprise. Why didn't you call me? I would have picked you up. I'm here. Why call? Aren't you going to invite me in? Oh, right. Come in, come in. It's a--no palazzos, no gondolas? They call this Venice? Yeah, it's California, pop. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Come on in. How about some tea? I've got the water boiling. Oh, yeah, some tea would be nice. Take your coat off. Ohh, what a nice place you got here, Yussel. Ohh, ooh, ohh. Ah, real nice. ♪ My name is Yussel ♪ Ho ho, good. I see you haven't forgotten everything. You look good, Yussel, for one who has changed so much. Pop, you used to tell me seasons change. People don't change. Maybe you the exception, huh? No, not me. Then come home with me now. Pop, I can't come home. I just cut my first album. Sure, I know. You know they want me to perform on national television? Pop, look, I know it's hard for you to understand, but this is a whole new career for me. You're a cantor. Pop, the world can do without another cantor. You're wrong, Yussel. Ask yourself, why in the war, when so many died, god spared us, a family of cantors. There must be a reason. It's got to make sense. Come on, pop. To sing in shul. There's the reason. To serve him, Yussel. You must come home with me now before you forget everything you were ever born to be. Yussel! Come on! Stop! Please for once in your life would you listen to me? I know what you believe. I tried to live up to it, pop. I swear I tried to live up to it, but I can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. Pop, I have things inside of me. I have to express them. I have my music. I have my life, my feelings. Maybe they come from god, too. I don't know. I do know I have to do it my own way. Does finding your own way, include leaving your wife? What did she say to you? She didn't have to say anything. You here, she there, 3 months. Man and wife, that's no good. Pop, we're getting a divorce. A divorce? She wants it, too. It happens to people everyday, pop. People yes, but not a boy and girl who grew up together. Why, Yussel? Why? I got another couple of bags in the car. Do you think you could... Pop, this is Molly. Molly, say hello to my father. How do you do? Cantor Rabinovitch. No! No! I have... no son. Pop. Pop, why are you doing this? Pop! Pop! Why are you doing this? Your only son, pop!

What happened to the groove? I got to do this on Zany's show tomorrow night, first TV shot and you guys are going to make me look like an idiot. Ahh. This arrangement stinks as well. Take 5. So, what did the doctor say? Another rabbit bit the dust. Congratulations. You're going to be a mother, huh? I wouldn't tell him now, though. He's liable to punch you out. Yeah. I heard. You know, I really don't know how much longer we can take it, Molly. All right. Come on. Let's do it. Don't lose your sense of humor. Hey, you know, I'm going to try. There, we know the charts. Yeah, ok. Where's Bubba? We know the charts. Bubba, come on. Hey, come on, will ya? I don't have all day for this. We don't have all day. Hey, man. I'm moving my black ass as fast as I can, you know?

Are you trying to make me look bad? Come on, Jess, be cool. Hey, don't tell me to cool it, man. You listen to that playback. Play it. Play it. It'll be a minute, Mr. Robin. Jesse, stop it, huh? Hey, I'm the guy out front there. Remember that? Look, you're not mad at them. You're just mad at yourself. Look, I don't want to know about it. You've been like this ever since your father left. Don't talk to me about my father. That's what it's all about. Don't lay it all out on them just because you can't handle it. Don't tell me I can't handle it. I don't need him. I don't need you. I don't need any of this. I've had it. What's wrong with him? I'm going to go talk with him. No, Bubba. Just let him work it out for himself.

Ok, Charlie. Pretend you don't know me. Oh, don't tell me, Mr. Wonderful is back. And just in time for Zany's autumn special from New York. Are you kidding? He walked out on Zany last year. The answer's no. One song, Eddie, that's all I'm asking. - No. - You owe him! He took a hike. Who remembers him? His album went gold. A year ago. I'll bet your commission paid for this car. Where can I drop ya? New York. Forget it! Damn it! You owe him! I hate him! I love him! All right. One number, scale. One song, two and a half minutes. - Three. - Two and a half! Oh, all right, two and a half. All right, three. Aw, thanks, Eddie. You win, three and a half. Oh! Thank you, Eddie! Come on, enough already. Come on! Enough! Whoo! What do you think? Huh? I love the piano. Yeah, are you gonna work the piano? Hmm? Do we have time to try for some more piano? I'm sorry, Jess, you're going to have to wait until Thursday rehearsals. What's wrong with tomorrow? Jewish holiday, Eddie, Yom Kippur. Any members of the band that are Jewish may leave now or if you know any Jewish people, you may leave. Take it easy, Jess. See you later. Night, fellas. See you, kids. Ok. And happy Yom Kippur. Night. Good night, Eddie. Leo, what's the matter? Did you get your tickets? It's not the tickets. - Yussel, I got the tickets. - Jess. Yussel... What is it, pop? Your father, it's high blood pressure. It's not serious, but the doctors wouldn't let him sing tonight. Leo, please. You realize what this means. It's the first time in five generations that a Rabinovitch wouldn't be singing on Yom Kippur. Did he ask you to come here and tell me that? No. I thought that tonight, if you would sing in his place, what better way to bring the two of you together again. Leo, look... I know you mean well, but it's too late for something like that. You're just as stubborn as he is. Honey, please! Stay out of it, ok? Jess, I may be a shiksa, but I know what Yom Kippur means. A day of atonement. Isn't it time? Look... we're together again. We have a beautiful new baby. You're going to be a smash in this show. It's perfect. Almost. Honey, forget it. I'm not going to go crawling back to my father. Jess, I'm not asking you-- Molly, please, forget it. I can't forget it, Jess. Honey, you still don't understand. He won't take my calls. He won't answer my letters. As far as he's concerned, I'm dead. You understand? I'm dead to him! I just can't forget that it was me who opened the door that day. It's me your father was looking at when he tore his clothes. Don't you see? If you don't at least try, this is always going to be something between us. Pop. We have to talk. It's been over a year, pop. Isn't that long enough? This Yom Kippur. Day of forgiveness. Please. Please, listen to me. You used to tell me you got to know where you come from to know where you're going. Well, I know where I come from. I know where I'm going now. I got my own congregation now and they love my music. It makes them feel things, it makes them happy. What is so terrible? You have a grandson, pop. Hyem Rabinovitch. 6th generation. Pop, it's no sin to marry someone you love. Look, look. He's even got mama's smile. I understand. You have no son, so you have no grandson. Well, you're wrong. You're wrong. And I'm sorry for you, for both of us. Yussel! Not only... mama's smile... your eyes.
