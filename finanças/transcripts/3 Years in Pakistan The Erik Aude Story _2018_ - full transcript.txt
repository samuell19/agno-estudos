Turn. Fuck! Wait... wait... Please. She does a grab, on the ground, stay on the ground. Sorry guys, excuse me. Slower is actually better than faster. I want you to keep the fight in this area. In this area. I'm gonna have the pads down on the ground for you guys the whole time, OK? Hard work doesn't bother him, ya know? You never hear him complaining. He's uh... collaborative. and that's what you look for in any artist you work with. What are you doing in acting for 2013? I got a lot of stuff going on, just acting, auditioning, living life, playing poker and enjoying every minute of it. He just has a positive attitude, he just has a positive outlook, he just laughs things off. And I think it's his way of, like always fighting to like hold on to his joy. So we're here at "Vice is Nice", every year it's my favorite charity by far, It's for animal rescue and I love that 100% of all profits go toward the animals. I, myself, have a rescue, and it's by far one of the best parts of my life. He's been through a lot and... You know, to still carry the smile on his face and be the cheerful guy that you know today is just a blessing. He has a hard shell and this sounds like super clich√©, but he's super loving. This is like my godmother in the poker world, but she's one of my best friends. I love this woman, love her sense of humor. The only woman to final table at the main event ever, still to this day. Poker is great-I love poker. I see people get mad and I just laugh, I go: "Why are you getting mad? just shake it off." It could always be worse, no matter how bad it gets, it could absolutely always be worse. I think he's honest to a fault. And I think he loves life no matter what took place, and I think he doesn't hold grudges. He's got a pair of Jack's. Gimme your fucking money. When I met him I feel like I'm home, ya know what I'm saying? I feel like somebody... You just get used to him so quickly for some reason, I don't know why. he's been through a lot, ya know. Life definitely hasn't been easy for him. I'm getting emotional. I feel like he puts up a front or tells his jokes or tries to be the tough guy, but... He's a sweetheart. It's something that happened to me so long ago. Are you fine with it all coming back up again? Because you... I don't know... because I did the show Locked up Abroad, it's constantly thrown back in my face again. And I'm constantly having to justify what uh, in people's words, I "claim" happened. I think it would be really good closure to tell your story in your own words, and then it's almost like... you get the last word because you got to tell the truth, and I think that's important. At least this way everyone can kinda see how I am and why I am the way that I am. I'm the youngest of six boys... no sisters. Peter's my only full brother. Um... When my mom met my dad she had Peter and myself but uh my dad and her just couldn't get along and ya know, she painted a really bad picture of my dad So I really didn't have a great relationship with my dad. Jeff and Michael are my mom's first two kids. They... they had it kind of bad. - There we go. - Hey, how are ya? I'm good, we finally meet! I feel like I know you. Can you tell me your full name and your relationship to Erik? My name is Jeffrey Farneski and I'm Erik's birth brother. I'm under Michael and above Peter and then Erik's the youngest. I know you guys were spread out, but if you can tell us what your relationship was like when you were kids. We actually didn't have one. Out of the children that Sherry, our mother, had, I was the only one placed up for adoption. So I actually found out about Erik when I was 18. My mom was... you know she was young, but she also wasn't... She wasn't the best idea of a mother, I guess you could say. Hello? Hi, Sherry? Who's calling for her, please? This is Jamielyn Lippman. I'm a friend of your son Erik's and I'm also a filmmaker. Your name again, please. Jamielyn. - Hi, Jamie. - Hi, how are you? I'm doing very well, thank you. Well I wanted to call you because I'm making a documentary about Erik and I wanted to see about coming out there to interview you. Does Erik know about this? He does. Has he given you permission to speak with me? Yes. OK, fine. I'll only say this: Erik is totally innocent. I will tell you that now. He is totally innocent. I'll put my hand on a bible and stand before God about that. I'll do anything for him. Sherry was involved in her own aspirations and Erik kinda went and did his thing. And I was usually out in the garage. Right before seventh grade, I was twelve years old. and Lethal Weapon had come... Lethal Weapon 3 was being filmed up in Lancaster at this old housing track. So Merle brought me there and he says: "Erik come back in twenty minutes." I stayed there for a couple hours that night. I knew I was gonna get in trouble. We saw the aftermath and saw the whole movie set and how things are laid out and how things are done, and I guess that put the hook in him. Growing up I liked to watch Jean-Claude van Damme movies, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, and I wanted to be those guys growing up. I wanted to be a stuntman my whole life. Tunnel vision, ya know if that's what he wants to do, then that's what he's gonna do. He's got his own set of principles. I was the kind of kid that you kept your kids away from. I was an asshole, I was a brat, I was a smartass, and it's my mouth that got me into a lot of fights. I was not athletic sports-wise. I was terrible. I tried basketball, I sat the bench... I didn't play football until I got into high school but the only reason I wanted to play football... The only reason I wanted to play football was because I liked to hit. As a football coach I'm gonna get a lot of different personalities, and I'm gonna have the opportunity to work with a lot of different guys. but Erik was always somebody I think that respected me enough to listen to my advice. And I think that really helped us become close. And to this day we're close friends. To this day I hold a California record. It's stood since 1996. Even though I played for a very small school, my record of "the most tackles by a defensive end" stands. I had 147 tackles. I wanted to play football but I wanted to act and do stunts even more. And I was doing little shows when I was still in high school. But the second I turned 18, I moved out of the house and I tried to get down to Hollywood. During this time I was still auditioning, I was booking some shows here. I booked a big WB show. I was doing Nickelodeon shows. I was always doing co-stars and small reoccuring... He got so much work it was crazy. I mean Erik was very aggressive, and he knew what he wanted and he would go for it. He would not give up. And he had friends that were directors. He would call them and get parts. And he just loved to be in front of a camera. I met Erik on an episode of Cousin Skeeter. It was a tv show I was doing for Nickelodeon and he came on as a guest star, and I remember thinking "This guy's crazy". He was just super awesome, full of energy, willing to try and do anything and we just got really close. Even though yes, I was starting to become a working actor, I still needed a side job to make ends meet because working as an actor maybe once every month or every other month just doesn't pay the bills. So I always had jobs. I was a security guard and I got asked to be the night time manager at a local gym called World Gym in Burbank. He's always talking, he loves to talk. Sometimes I tell him "Erik, you don't know these people". He's like: "Hey, you gonna practice this and that you have to know everybody." It's good because you never know who you're talking to. So when you're on the front, it's like easy access or easy victim for people to get to you. Because you work in the front desk, anybody can come and talk to you, you know what I'm saying? That's how that incident started. Yeah. Wait, Erik let me ask you: When's the last time that you came here? 2005 I got asked to come here and show somebody the place. so it's now a new gym, correct? Like it's not the same it was before but do the people that had worked there and the owners did they know everything that happened? I haven't talked or spoken to any of them since. When you came here in 2005, what was it like? Did it bring back... How did you feel emotionally? Did it bring back memories? Was it hard? Did you go inside? Yeah, I went inside, went downstairs, and saw them working out. I'm not the kinda guy who's gonna be like "oh no this is not where I want to be and bad memories". I mean my entire life has not been a cake walk So I've been used to this kind of crap. If something bad happens, I laugh it off. OK, let's go... let's see if we can go in. I became a personal trainer for a lot of the people that came in. I would work out with them and teach them how to use the equipment the right way. Guy named Rai Ghazarian was an Armenian in his mid-thirties. He was always paying me to work out and we were working out four days a week together. I was training him probably nine months. We became very good friends. when you're friends, you're guys, you talk about everything. You talk about girls. You talk about the hot girls in the gym. You talk about stupid shit, movies, sports. And something that he had started to trying to get me into, which several other people at the gym had been doing themselves. He would have young people in their late teens, early twenties, travel around the world importing expensive leather goods and then paying them for it. And it sounded like a dream job. I'd never been out of the country. I'd only been to a couple different states. But it's all changed. This wasn't here. It was... all the ellipticals were right here and Rai would usually be right here watching the TV's. It wasn't him who told me about it first, though, It was Arra. It was another guy that was making these trips. Another young guy making these trips told me about it. I knew him for a long time before I finally went on a trip. I had a lot of questions, I asked a lot of questions. But I saw him as a friend long before I ever decided to work with him. hopefully he will say yes. The person you have called is unavailable right now. Please try again later. His phone's off. Or a new number... Is unavailable usually disconnected or is that... Can be both. Or he didn't pay his bill. They haven't paid their bill, it might just be a go phone. Let me just call back to make sure I did that right. It sounded too good to be true. "Is that all you guys are bringing?" I said: "Why don't you just mail the stuff back?" He says: "If I have it mailed back I have to pay 55% import tax for them." By sending someone over I save anywhere between 13,000 to 14,000 dollars. "What happens if they catch you with the leather goods, will you go to jail for that?" He's like: "No, it's just a fine." I wasn't convinced, though. So my mom put me in touch with one of her friends who worked for the FBI and my question to him was: "Will I go to jail if I get caught doing this?" He goes: "No, you won't go to jail, but it's frowned upon. They'll confiscate it and give you a fine." "So I won't go to jail?" "No, it's like a jaywalking ticket." That's how he explained it to me. And that made my decision. He came over to my mom's house and he was getting ready to go to Turkey and he was super excited because he's an adventurous person. And he was like: "Dude, I got this job, I can totally... I'm importing leathers and I get to travel and everything is paid for and it's just awesome." And ya know we were kids So we didn't think anything. We just thought like wow this is amazing! And he's like: "Do you want to come?" And I'm like: "Hell yeah, I want to come!" At the time I was working So I couldn't go, But I remember just being really excited for him that he had found this other job besides working at the gym. He was my last child and the day that I had him I never had one contraction. Not one. he let me know he was coming and 45 minutes later he was born. He's always been pretty inquisitive, but between school, football, movie industry, cars, helping other people. I think I over-protected him. I wished I'd let him go out and learn the world, but I didn't want him to get hurt. So he was ripe picking for wolf in sheep's clothing. You never think something like this could ever happen to anyone. It only happens in movies. It doesn't happen to people in real life. But uh... I learned the hard way that... I learned the hard way that uh this stuff does happen and it would... cost me more than I could ever imagine. I would go to jail for a crime I didn't commit and I would come out a murderer. There's so much to see in Turkey. Turkey's a beautiful country. Istanbul is just amazing. I was there for a few days. I felt big, I didn't feel small anymore because I was experiencing life. Traveling is amazing and I love it. when I landed in Stockholm, they had a drug sniffing dog sniffing everyone's bags. The dog pulled me out, but it wasn't just pulling me out it was pulling people out at random. Ny imagination was like uh I got screwed. This is Brokedown Palace, Midnight Express... They went through everything, all the jackets, found nothing. Everything was fine and they were like: "Alright you're good to go." And I was: "Okay!" So now I was like: "Alright this is the most legit job ever!" Rai was there waiting for me. He picked me up from the airport. The whole way to my house he was telling me "See! Did you have a great time?" "I had a great time". He's like: "What did you do?" And I was telling him about my trip. When we got to my apartment we brought the leather cases in and I showed him everything. It all seemed copacetic. He was happy with everything and he paid me eight-hundred dollars right there. And I thought: "Wow, this is the best job ever". He asked me "When can I go again?" He wanted me to go literally in like the next month. I started filming the movie The Scorpion King, and I was working on that movie as a as a stuntman. So I said: "I can't I'm working on a movie." And I was getting a lot of acting jobs at this time but I wanted to keep this opportunity open. I didn't want to lose it. I wanted to go on more trips in the future. So what I started to do was to encourage this job to everyone, to my friends, my family... Hell, I even encouraged it to my mother. Yeah, he told all of us about it. I knew about it, my girlfriend at the time knew about it, our brother Michael knew about it, his wife. Everybody knew. This was a guy that was at his gym. He used to train him. Rai was a buddy of his. We all heard about him. September 11th happens... And it was a big wake-up call for America. And no one wanted to go on any trips understandably. No one wanted to go on any trips anymore. My brother Peter, when I told him about these trips, he actually reached out to me. He wanted to go on one of these trips. He said: "Yeah, I could absolutely use 800 dollars, that would be awesome." So I set him up with Rai. I get a call from Rai. He tells me: "Peter says: he's not going, and I put a lot of money into this, it's putting me in a really bad spot, you need to talk to him." I said: "Alright I'll call him." Because this is making me look bad. I vouched for Peter and he's backing out and I didn't understand why. So I called Peter and he just matter-of-factly goes: "Yeah, Erik I'm not going." and he wasn't explaining why he wasn't going. I'm like: "Why? Peter you're making me look like a dick." He's like: "I'm not going over there, it's not gonna happen." I go: "Why?" "Because it's dangerous." I say: "You have nothing to worry about. Turkey's a great country." He says: "It's not to Turkey, it's to Pakistan." I said: "What are you talking about?" "Cause yeah, Rai's saying it's to Pakistan, I'm not going to Pakistan." And now I agreed with Peter. I agreed with Peter. I said: "No you're not going to Pakistan." I can vouch for Turkey because I've been there twice now, but I've never been to Pakistan So I can't vouch for Pakistan. So I call Rai "What the hell is going on? Peter's saying it's to Pakistan." Yeah, I've got a really good deal over there." "Whoa no! You didn't tell me it was to Pakistan. Peter doesn't want to go." He says: "Look I've already set everything up. I've spent a lot of money on this. If your brother backs out now, I will lose a lot of money." Rai started making me feel really bad, and Peter wasn't gonna go. He didn't want to go. He had his mind set up. And I didn't want to let my friend Rai down. So even though I had no time, I took the trip. I took the trip. And I'm glad I did. I'm glad what was about to happen to me would happen to me rather than someone else because of me. I walk out of the airport to where all the visitors are and there's a guy there with a napkin that has my name written on it. He says to me right then and there: "Hey man, Rai messed up." I go: "What do you mean he messed up?" He goes: "You were supposed to come to Karachi." I go: "Okay, where's that?" Karachi's eight hour drive south of Islamabad. I'm in Islamabad and Karachi is a couple hour flight from Islamabad. So I said: "What does that mean?" "We got to go down there." I go: "Am I coming with you?" "No, we will put you up in a hotel here." And....first off, they're telling me: "By the way you don't want to leave the hotel." I'm like: "Why?" "Because they don't like Westerner's here." I'm like: "What?" First off don't tell me that because I'm not staying in a room for a week. That's not at all an option. And I decided to do what I do. I put on my jogging shorts, my backpack, and my tank top and I went jogging through the streets of Islamabad. I got so many evil faces so many angry stares, but I would just smile and wave and just keep going because you don't want to "mad dog" people back. I don't want them to think I'm dangerous or anything. I want them to know I'm friendly and hopefully they'll be friendly towards me. But I don't talk to anyone and I find an Internet cafe just to see who's emailed me. There's one email that jumps out and it's an email from Missy. It wasn't to me, it was a group email telling me that her mother had died from cancer. What happened at that time? I remember sending out the email. He wrote back. I believe he said something like: "I'm so sorry. I love you. I'll be home soon." And when he had sent you that email was there... I think on his end the hope of him coming back and maybe restarting that again or seeing where this could go? That was definitely something that was on the table. Missy was my motivation in life, for so many different things. She was the reason I worked out hard, the reason I studied longer, the reason I wanted to be very successful as an actor just so I could be on her radar. That night I go back to the hotel. I can't wait to get on the flight. I have an early morning flight it's around 6 a.m. I get a call from downstairs that one of the guys are here to pick me up and they want me to come downstairs. That's not how it's ever worked in Turkey, though. They always come upstairs, let me go through everything. I have to grade it. Guy brings up one suitcase, only one suitcase. So I call Rai immediately from the hotel and I say: "Hey Rai... is this right?" I tell him it's one suitcase, it's seven pieces. He goes, "Yeah, that's right. It's just a first trip we want to see how it goes." Instead of being concerned, I'm actually kind of happy. Cool, I don't have to carry all this luggage anymore. I'm not going to have to pay money at the airport because it's not that heavy." So I'm kind of relieved. Alright, cool. It's just one suitcase, at least that's nice. I take my suitcase, I take my bag. I get up to the line for international departures and I'm probably six inches taller than the next person. Pakistani people are very tiny. And this is a long line. As soon as I get around the corner there's Customs up there. A Customs Officer sees me and waves me to the front. I'm like: "Yes! Alright it pays to be a foreigner." I go and I skip this long line and go up to the front and I'm about to go through the metal detectors when someone grabs my arm. I turn around and another guy comes up and says: "You carrying narcotics?" I said: "Check it again." He takes the suitcase, only my suitcase. Not my backpack, not my bag, opens it up and throws all the leather jackets and clothes onto the floor. Now I'm pissed I'm like: "Whoa! That's what I'm here for. What the fuck?" He takes the suitcase goes to another room. Goes someplace else. I start folding up all the clothes and everything. And a guard takes me, asks me to follow him. I follow him while folding up all the stuff. He comes back into the room followed by a guard who's in uniform holding two thin sealed patches and he says: "What is this?" I said: "He's holding it." Meaning like he is the one who's holding it, so he should know what it is. He goes: "This is opium." I said: "Why are you showing me this?" He says: "It came out of your luggage." I got a phone call from the American embassy and Islamabad Pakistan saying that my son Erik has been arrested for drug smuggling and he was facing death by hanging. And I'm going: "No! no!" You know we Americans are so innocent, so na√Øve. So protected. I'm going: "No! No! Here I got this number it's Frank Azaria and he hired him." You know. I just... I let myself in, called up, say: "Hey, Sherry I'm here." I go in and I see all these maps of Pakistan and Afghanistan. And she comes down says: "What do you think of that?" I say, "What do I think? What do you have these on your table for?" She goes: "Erik's in prison." And it's just like someone comes up and goes boom right in the chest. I sit down and I get back up and I'm like: "What?" She goes: "Erik's in prison for drug smuggling." And I think I just looked at her for awhile you got puppy-dog-cookie-head like: "Where are the cameras and when is the joke gonna be over?" I got hit in the head by a rifle and I got dragged off to a customs lock-up. I know I'm innocent. A lot of people know I'm innocent. So I'm thinking this will blow over once they know I'm innocent. I'm going to be out of here maybe in a couple days. There's no way they're going to keep me here. So I'm taking photos, and I'm posing for these photos because this is it's a fucking joke in my eyes. There's no way they're going to keep me here because innocent people don't fucking stay in bad situations like that, they just don't. That's what I believed. The embassy consulate, this girl named Christy Agor tells me they're going to put me in front of a lower court magistrate who's going to decide how many days of physical remand I get. And I go: "What does that even mean?" She goes, "Well here in Pakistan they have something called physical remand. It's where they think that by beating you you're going to tell them the truth." The customs police came and got me and took me in a vehicle to another part of town maybe only twenty or thirty minutes away. Christy comes forward and talks to the judge in Urdu. As we're walking away, she's telling me what happened. "What happened?" She goes: "The judge wanted ten days. I got you three." What's going on is we're preparing for flashback scenes for this documentary. Jamie wants to... Jamie wants to recreate as much as possible. We've got a talented actor to play me. I don't play twenty-one anymore and even if I could, I wouldn't want to do this again. Just gonna be a fun two days of awesome memories. Salam alaikum. What's your name? Erik Aud√©. And how old are you, Mr. Aud√©? 21. Where are you from? America. You do know that I've been asked these questions already, right? And what is it that you do in... America? I'm an actor. Actor. Hollywood. Who give you the drugs Mr. Actor? I didn't get any drugs. Again, who gave you the drugs? Nobody. I didn't get any drugs. Wait... I'm telling you... I'm innocent. I'm telling you the truth. I'm telling you the truth. I'm innocent. I'm telling you everything I know. I'm telling you... I'm innocent. Everyone starts out saying that. So Mr. Aud√©, where did you buy the drugs from? I didn't get any drugs. I'm telling you the truth. You don't have to do that. I'll tell you everything I know. I've told you everything, there's nothing else to say. - I'm telling you the truth. - The truth. Please, I'm telling you the truth. Please. Please. Please! Fuck! Please, please. I'm telling you the truth. I don't know anything else! Fuck! I need you to listen to me. This guy sent me here to pick up some leather goods for him and bring them back that's all I know. I don't... I don't know anything about any drugs. I swear to you. I swear to God. You know, I've never tortured a Hollywood movie star before. I'm going to enjoy this. Please. Who gave you the drugs? Fuck. I'm telling you the fucking truth. Rai, Rai Ghazarian! Gay Gazar... Where does he live? I don't know, okay? Los Angeles. I need a name in Pakistan! An address! A phone number! I don't have any. At the hotel... How did he look like? Was he tall? Short? - He looked fucking Pakistani! - Pakistani? - Yes! - Give me a phone number I don't... No! Because I'm innocent, I had no right answers for them. So... So nothing I say is going to make them stop. That sick son of a bitch upstairs who some of us call God, it's like he's been preparing me my whole life for this situation. Just months before the show Fear Factor had come out and the first episode I ever watched the person who won 50,000 dollars, won because he could hold his breath for a minute and 13 seconds. After I saw that episode I said: "You know, I'm going to go and get myself on Fear Factor ." I would practice at night to hold my breath. I would hold my breath when I got in the shower. When I was at a stoplight. Before I went to bed. And I got it to where I could hold my breath for almost three minutes. Now here I am being dunked by these guys and they're keeping me under at least a minute to a minute and a half. I didn't want them to know how easy it was for me. But I'm thinking to myself had I not seen that damn show. I would be in a lot of trouble right now. Do you have anything you wish to tell me? You are torturing an innocent man. Hollywood. Just tell me the drugs are yours, this will be over. No. Erik had the physique. He had the discipline, he had the pain tolerance. Because of Erik's bus accident he learned to deal with pain. Because Erik lives in pain every day. I was run over by a school bus. I was eight years old and the two back rear tires ran over my pelvis. It shattered my pelvis like a glass jar. I wouldn't be able to walk again for a couple years. When I got home from the hospital I had these... the worst kidney pains. I started feeling bad for being a nuisance to everyone when I screamed because they couldn't do anything for me. So I would start to... I would start to force myself to scream in silence. He got the beatings on the hand where his hands are like permanently broken. I know he said he got beatings on the feet. He has scars all over his feet. I would not have lasted. I know that. I don't know. I mean I just remember feeling... Just feeling really empty, you know and saying how the hell? What do you do? I remember thinking like that can't be possible. Like my understanding of other countries at that time it was like textbook or what you see in the news. You don't see it happening to someone that you know. It's just unbelievable what goes on. You don't think this shit really happens. You watch a movie.... But this shit really happens. And it happened to me. I was getting tortured. I got tortured. And you know it's... It's painful, but it's more emotionally painful than physically. It is. And I hate thinking about it. I... I... When I finally got brought to... I got brought back to the customs lock up and Christy came again. They let me use a cell phone to call my mom to let her know how I was doing and everything. I didn't tell her anything. I just said everything was fine. Everything is fine, what's going on on your end? She's trying to get lawyers. She contacted the police to try to find out where I was. "We can't find him." That's what's confusing me. I don't understand why you can't find Rai. It should be very easy, you had cell phones. You shouldn't be too hard to find. Everyone knew him. Rai Ghazarian, that's all I know. Rai Ghazarian. Well one of the reporters that was there, I forget which newspaper he worked for, but later on that day somebody from the office called me and he says: "I think you've got the wrong person." I said: "What do you mean?" 'Cause I also gave out the phone numbers that I had. Well, the cellphone was, of course you know, dead, no longer good. and of course, the office phone was disconnected but it still can be traced So they did a reverse directory on that number. So I called and I said: "Can I speak to Rai Ghazarian?" And he said: "Speaking". and I said: "Are you Rai Ghazarian Jr. because you're not the Rai Ghazarian I want to talk to." And he said: "What's going on?" Are you guys trying to sell me newspapers or what?" And I said: "What do you mean?" And he said: "The first guy called asking for me, doesn't he work for some newspaper? Now what, you want me to buy a subscription or what?" I said: "No sir, I don't. Let me tell you a story." And I told him what he had done to my son. He says: "I know who set your son up." And I said: "Rai Ghazarian." He said: "No. His name isn't Rai Ghazarian. His name is Razmik Minasian." M-I-N-A-S-I-A-N. Razmik Minasian. Let's see what comes up here. Oh my god. That's him yeah. That's him. Now I gotta send him a message, okay. Maybe we should go to... If he has a Linkedin. Linkedin. The next day I'm driven to Rawalpindi. Rawalpindi was home to the biggest prison in all of Pakistan. It was called Central Jail Adyala. They have these prisoners inside the prison who police the prisoners they're called numberdards and they're giving me a welcoming wagon. Now they're horse-shoed around the door. I would say it was like ten or twelve of them. But the reason they're horse-shoed around the door so they can corral you and everything. And the guards think it's funny. They take bets. They think it's funny, who's going to do what to who. This is just part of the way it is in Pakistan. So when the guards starts looking at me like this: "Hey, get ready. You're going to fight." And it's like if you're not... One of the biggest messages from any prison movie or show you ever watch is: If you go in weak you're going to be somebody's bitch. So I got in that game frame. This is opening kick-off. I'm Erik "all day" Aud√©, the meanest motherfucker up in this motherfucker. Let's dance. I'm dropping them. I'm bodyslamming these guys. No one at all came close to fucking me up that day when I first got in there. This little guy who works... who's a mishakti. Mishakti is a prison worker, not a numberdard, he let's me know he wants me to follow him and we go off into the prison. I get up to lay down where a bunch of blankets are. I just want to sleep but someone says to me: "American?" I'm like: "Nope. Pakistan born and raised right down the road here. Been here my whole life." Guy's like, "No. You're the American." Shows me the front page of a newspaper article and sure enough there's my dickhead ass. And I was smiling for the cameras. So now I'm in another fight and this time I'm getting ass handed to me. I'm losing this fight. There's just too many. And this guy was on my back just scratching me off. I threw him off the balcony onto a crowd below. I threw him onto a crowd. And then the guards ran up to the stairs and started baton charging and hitting me with their batons. I got dragged to a place in prison called kasoari. I would spend the first five days in jail in kasoari. Kasoari is... it's not a prison sized room, it's like a closet. Once a day everyday I would have the bottom of my feet beat. I would spend a total of 132 days of the three years that I would remain in this prison in that room. The longest I spend in kasoari in a row was eight weeks. The things that you think about when you're in kasoari are... You start to remember things you thought you forgot. How you took shortcuts home from school when you were a kid... I made up songs... I relived scenarios of my life. I watched movies in my head. I thought about the days I would get out and get my hands around Rai's neck. I thought about Missy a lot. You know you just... You just think. That's all you can do. In the beginning there was a lot of high hopes for him coming home and us being able to have a relationship and a lot of different things happening. and you just... We could not have anticipated things happening the way that they did. I don't think anyone can. And were you aware of what was happening to him while he was in the prison and the torture and... Erik didn't tell me a lot. I think he just didn't want to worry me. and he'd tell his mom not to tell me things, but Sherry would tell me some stuff anyways. So I was aware to a point. I don't think I ever had the full picture of it at that time, but Erik always tried to paint a happier picture for me. I did not know the extent of what he was experiencing when he first got there and I think that was a conscious choice for him not to share it with me because me being upset or crying on the phone was not going to help him needing to hear positivity and hope and someone to have a positive outlook and tell him like: "Dude, you're coming back. We all know it. we're all believing it. I'll see you soon." I couldn't be in general population because some asshole put a 5,000 rupee bounty on my head. And whenever someone asks me, "Hey what's your life worth?" I know exactly what my life is worth: My life is worth 87 dollars. So my job was to keep his spirits up, keep him fed, keep him alive, keep the news media on him. Because as long as I could keep his name out there, Pakistan was not about to do anything to him because the world was watching. She was a wreck. She was, she wanted to go over there and get him out but of course she can't. but she would just call the senator and people who she thought could help him get out. We would do walks to try to get him out. She had yard sales to collect money to send him money because he needed money and food you know, to buy. And I know that she would just do anything to get her son out of that prison. A superintendent came to the prison and said: "Hey, the safest place for us to put this guy is on death row." I got put in my own cell on death row which is a luxury, having your own cell is a luxury, and there's are no beds, you sleep on the floor. You have one squat toilet. You wipe your ass with your hand and then wash your hand off. There's no toilet paper. That's just how it is. And these rooms are covered cockroaches, covered with mosquitos, with spiders. The elements are there for the wind to come in sideways and dust going in. When it rains the cells fill up and the rats will start to swim around. The first few months were really terrible because I was hungry. I was starving. I'm literally twice the size of everyone around me and I was getting the same amount of food as all of them. So I was always hungry. If you want to eat more, you have to have money and buy from one of the outside cantinas or bribe the guards to go out and get it for you. But I have no way to communicate other than... Literally the first few weeks I started realizing I need to understand these people because no one is able to understand me. What I would do is I would tear pieces of paper into sections, fold em up and I would start writing the words in Urdu, and the way they're written, the way it sound, and I was learning 20 to 40 words a day. Because he was somebody that could just pick up book and teach himself, I think that helped him too. Other people started to respect him more when he learned their language. In the room just next to me was a man named Mourad. Mourad could speak a little bit of English. He was very friendly to me, offered me lunch, breakfast. He was the only one that spoke any English, so him and I would become very good friends. We would become best friends in prison. He was on death row for killing 11 of his wife's family members. And it sounds awful and it is. In Pakistan you're told who you're going to marry. And Mourad and his wife fell in love on their own and they had to run away to be together. And they ran away and got married. Well, while they ran away both their families were feuding and fighting. They were killing each other. They were accusing one another of hiding the couple. Well what brought him out of hiding was his wife's family members kidnapped his mother and his sister and they gang raped them and murdered them by having their breasts cut off and letting them bleed to death. So Mourad ambushed his wife's family members killing 11 of them. But in jail he wasn't... You know he was very kind to me. And he introduced me to the game of Texas Hold 'em poker. The first time I ever picked up a hand at poker was on death row in Pakistan. when you play all the time you start to learn how to read people. It doesn't matter what language they speak or anything, but when people are scared it shows the same regardless of what nationality they are. Hardly any of the politicians wanted to get involved. I was pretty much on my own. I was spending like I said, I slept maybe an hour a day. because I felt like I was in a maze, you know, because so many doors were being closed, but I had to keep going. You know when you have this deep... like deep inside you: "He's coming back." And sometimes the other mind told you, "Wake up, this is a cold case in Pakistan, it's not going to happen." and you're like going back and forth with your head like a crazy man, it's the same thing. And on the other side you're like, all these people sending letters, people calling, there is a hope that somebody will do something so that's the only thing that's making me have a huge hope he's coming back. On the other hand I look at the case... Until the guy got arrested. Roughly six months after I was in jail a DEA agent comes and he shows me two photos and asked me do I recognize anyone in these photos. I immediately picked out Rai. I was like: "That's Rai." And he goes, "Well his name is Razmik Minasian." And this is where I would find out that he had been using an alias the whole time. And I'm like: "Cool, well how did you guys get him?" What had happened was a Swedish woman was traveling in from JFK airport, doing the same thing I was doing, but she lost her luggage at JFK. So she continued on her itinerary to LAX. They found the drugs in the wall of her suitcase, built professionally into the suitcase, and they arrested both her and the man that I had known as Rai Ghazarian. Except he posted bail under the name Razmik Minasian. My mom's private investigator hears about this, brings it to the attention of the DEA and hey this sounds a lot like that guy who set up Erik. So they rearrest him, deny him bail... They let the Swedish girl go back to her country without being charged in less than two weeks simply because her story matched mine and several others. So when I heard about this I felt great. I'm like: "Great, someone's not in jail because of me." That's awesome. I felt good about that. So now here I got the DEA guy telling me this story and I'm asking what happens now? "What are you guys doing to get me out of here?" And I could tell by his expression that he felt bad. And I'm like: "What's going on?" He goes: "I've never seen this before." I go: "What do you mean?" He said: "I've never actually met someone who's innocent." They let her go home and arrested him. But nobody would do anything to help me get Erik home. He goes: "If this had been done in America you'd be going home tonight. Because since it's done here in Pakistan, you still have to go through the legal system here. It sucked being in jail for something I didn't do and no one believing me, but believe it or not it sucks a lot worse when people actually believe you, and the people you assumed could... And the people that you know that could do something about it believe you, but choose not to do anything about it. Yeah, no that's great. OK, so I need to ask you, so what was the involvement with your friend that was the PI? Can we call him and see? Yeah, let's just see. so and then my question is... So I really want to interview Rai but I'm having a really hard time tracking him down. I have a phone number that's disconnected. I found an address on the Internet that could be his... I found a bunch of businesses that he used to have that seemed to all dissolve and all those numbers are disconnected. I sent him a message, I found him on Facebook but we're not connected so he hasn't seen the message yet. But we're kind of at the end and I really didn't find... How I could go about finding an address, an email, a phone number. If you have either his full name and middle initial or his social security number or a former address I can find out where he is now. - Okay. - A former address? A former address? what if it was an old... an old business address or one that he used for a business? Would that work? Yeah, that would work. And it probably would take about an hour to get the complete background on him. Some of the superintendents started liking me, one in particular was a man named Hijuub. He's the one who would introduce me to the Palestinian hijackers. The hijacking of Pan Am flight 73 is over but the cost has been very high. Many passengers who were on board are in shock. many have been wounded in the final orgy of violence, and some passengers plus two of the hijackers have been killed. these guys were happy that their plan had failed because their mission was to kill themselves and kill everyone on board that plane. what did happen, was their actions led to 23 people being killed. The first person I meet was Fahaad. Fahaad was the youngest and by this time he's in his thirties. He's a big man and he's wearing a big muumuu. The hijackers are celebrities in here. I'm a celebrity in here. The future prime minister of Pakistan is up in "A class". His name is Yousaf Gilani he's a celebrity in there. And then you've got political officials but there's really only a few of us who everyone knows of. So I somehow become friends with these guys. They order... They make food for us, we sit around, we drink Pepsi and some sweet dish they just happen to have, and their rooms are really nice actually there's a carpet on the floor. They prayed, they ate food, and tried to get through each day as easily as possible. When I got moved nine and a half months later from death row to two cell I was able to socialize with these guys more. Go have breakfast and lunch with them and swap books over the wall. But one thing that the hijackers had, which was a big deal, was they had connections with the guard. The guards wouldn't search the room. The hijackers were left alone and they had a lot of clout. They had something that I definitely needed. How did you get a camera inside prison? I got a camera into the prison because of one of the hijackers, Fahaad got it in for me. I wanted to take some photos and he got it in. Like what would happen if they found... Like people don't have cameras in prison, do they? People aren't supposed to have a lot of things in prison, but we have them. if you get caught with them you get in trouble. Simple. Getting in trouble is getting beat, punished, thrown into kasoari. Privileges taken away. But how do you get them? You actually just pay people on the outside? Yeah! People... Guards smuggle things in, religious teachers smuggle things in, prisoners smuggle things in, the canteen smuggles things in. Guys throw things over the wall. Hell fuck, if we had drones back in the day you'd see drones dropping things left and right. Wow, that's amazing. I'm glad I got some photos. I had the camera for I think two, maybe three days. And that's what I was able to get in those two or three days. It started with food. Well then it got to things bigger. "Hey, I'll give you 1,000 rupees for a cell phone." Guy brings me a cell phone. I'm able to find a signal in a corner of my room and at night I'm able to communicate with my family and my friends. The first time I go to talk to Erik... First of all I was blown 'cause I was like: "How the hell did you get a cell phone?" And then at the same token I was like: "Of course, it's you, it's Erik." You know. And we talked about how he had made friends with some people in there. We talked about how initially it was super, super, super hard kinda being the American so to speak. We talked about how he learned different languages. How he cultivated relationships. How he was able to get some DVD's and movies that I had done that he had watched. And it just was good, you know, And we still just believed that eventually he would come home. During this whole time I'm still learning the language. I'm still learning Urdu. And I'm also trying to work on my case. I'd finally gotten a lawyer who was just a piece of shit lawyer to agree to take my case for 2,000 dollars which is still five times more than anyone else would have paid but it's a lot less than a lot of lawyers are asking me for. and I would go back and forth to court so many times and nothing would happen. either the judge wouldn't show up, the prosecutor wouldn't show up, my own lawyer wouldn't show up. What we needed for the courts, was Razmik Menasian to sign a statement stating that he'd never told Erik about the drugs and that might, might you know, do some good. I had found out where he lived and I found out he had two kids and I'm not a vindictive woman, but I was fighting for my son. I wrote him a letter and I told him how Erik couldn't believe that his friend Rai would do this to him. I mean Rai was his friend, he was just in shock. And I wrote in there how Erik was being starved, and tortured, and beaten. You know I said he can't believe you would do this to him. And then I went on and I said: "How maybe if he would confess that maybe the courts would look at that and grant Erik clemency." And then I went one step further, and I'm ashamed of it but I had to do it. I said: "I know you're surprised that we found you, because we know you as Rai Ghazarian. But now that I know you're Razmik Minasian, what would you do if someone was going to hurt your son or daughter? Think about it." He signed an affidavit stating that I was absolutely unknowing. So I go to court January third and the lady says to me: "Erik, this is what's going to happen: The judge is going to give you a two year prison sentence, we're going to pay him 1,000 dollars through your account, it's already in your account, and with good behavior you'll probably be going home in a couple months." I said: "This is great, this is great news, that's awesome." They go: "Okay. All you have to do though is plead guilty." At that moment I didn't know... I didn't know what I was going to do. What solidified my choice was what Absaal the interpreter from the embassy said. He stands next to me and he goes: "Erik, what is worth more to you, your pride or your freedom?" And I remember looking at him and I was like: "You little bastard." Because that made me ask myself that question: What is worth more to me? My pride or my freedom? And there was no hesitation. My pride is worth a hell of a lot more to me than my freedom. At the end of the day I have to look at myself in the mirror and if I get out of prison I'm going to end up killing myself 100 percent from just shame of going around pleading guilty for some shit I didn't fucking do. Yeah, it's Pakistan, but yes my pride is worth a hell of a lot more to me than my freedom. When I got presented back in that room that day the judge asked me if I wished to change my plea and I told him "No, not guilty." I went into Erik's room and I opened his closet and I wanted to smell my son. And I held all his clothes and there wasn't any smell. And I didn't know I had collapsed to the floor. And I heard this animal howling and you could tell the animal was in pain I mean absolute pain... And I realized it was me. Hello? Hi, can I please speak with Razmik? He's not here, may I ask who's calling? My name is Jamielyn Lippman and I'm a documentary filmmaker and I wanted to talk to him about being part of a project that I'm making. Ok, he's not here. Can I... Is there a better time that I could call back to reach him or does he have a cell phone number? Maybe around six o'clock? Call him about six o'clock? Okay. Should I leave my information with you or should I try him back? I can take your phone number, sure. Yeah, that would be great, thank you. Hold on one moment. The very next morning I went and called my mom and I said: "Mom look, I already know what I'm going to do for the high court." And I tried to tell her my plan for the high court and she had already cut me off. She said that she already had a lawyer lined up for me, that this guy was one of the best that he came highly recommended. She was so confident over the phone I said... I gave her my blessing. go ahead, go with this guy. Originally my mother told me that he took the case pro bono. a couple months go by and I finally ask my mom, I go: "Mom what's going on with my case?" The hijackers say: "We have a lawyer that we'd like to recommend. The same lawyer that represented us for our case." Seven months after I'd been sentenced we threw ourselves at the mercy of the court to hopefully show leniency. They did. They gave me a second chance at the high court. But what should have been done seven months previous was being done seven months later. Well because of the amount of cases that were going to be shown at high court it wouldn't be for another year and four months before my case would finally get heard. Before that would happen, though I would take one of the worst beatings I've ever taken in my life. We had a guard he was... He was nicknamed Goldleaf, and Goldleaf is the name of a cigarette brand in Pakistan. It was rumored that he was responsible for the death of hundreds of prisoners since that prison had opened up in 1986 who either couldn't afford to buy him Goldleaf cigarettes or just flat out refused to. I had been dealing with these severe ear aches ever since monsoon season had happened my first year there. The cockroaches would come out of their hiding places in masses and crawl all over you. You'd get mosquitos biting every open inch of you. And you would sleep in the water. I would literally think suicide all the time because of my ears. Not because of being in this situation or being alone or being sad or feeling sorry for myself, but because I was in so much pain that I thought: "Hey, if I kill myself it wouldn't be... It would be humane." Well Goldleaf he calls America a bunch of... he calls America a bunch of female dogs and then he says to me, "Give me 500 rupees." But I'm in so much damn pain, I just don't want to be fucked with by this guy. So I tell him in his own language: "Hey, we may all be dogs, but you're a little bitch." And he just... He didn't like that at all. He didn't like that at all, so he fumbles with his keys and goes to open the cell door. And when he came in... I mean this guy's like five foot three, he goes in and hit me with his cane. And I grabbed him and I started punching him with his own hand and then I just lost it. I was in so much pain I just wanted to die. At least this way it wasn't going to be suicide but I was gonna make these guys earn it. So that day I absolutely planned on dying. I had a couple of my ribs broken, my left shoulder was collapsed, my left eye was closed up. They held out my hand and broke each one of my fingers one by one, and when they started on my left hand, they got one of my fingers, and when they were about to move on to my other finger, the Superintendent finally showed up and asked what the hell was going on. And I heard... I heard Goldleaf say that they found drugs on me that I attacked them. And I understood all this and I told them in their own language: "Goldleaf's lying." I said: "They are stealing money from me. I'm starving, I'm gonna die." And he comes over and he sees me and I'm on the ground and he says: "You understand Urdu?" I said: "Yes sir." And he says: "What happened?" So I get up. I'm holding my hand because my fingers are all fucking jacked. I tell him that Goldleaf wanted 500 rupees from me and I told him to go to hell. And then I told him about some of the beatings I'd taken for money and how they stole it from me and he believed me. He believed me and he fired Goldleaf right there on the spot. - Hello? - Hi, is this Razmik? - Yes. - Oh hi, my name is Jamielyn How are you? - Very good, thank you. - Good. I'm a documentary filmmaker and I'm making a documentary about Erik Aud√©. - Who's Erik? - Erik Aud√©. - No, I don't know him. - Does that... That name is not familiar to you? No. No. You know what? There is a Razmik with the same last name as mine and we did have a few problems. We went to court for that. He was involved with the drug... you know... smuggling people and lots of other things. Many, many collection agencies. Even like I said. I've been subpoenaed from the court, you know, for that and had to go to court and show them I'm not the person, yeah. Okay. Okay so... His name is same as mine, his last name is same as mine. Yeah. Well, I'm so sorry because you probably have to... You've been dealing with this mix up for years. So I appreciate you taking my call and calling me back. We... Good luck. Thank you So much, have a great night. - Alright, you too. Bye. - Bye. I started cleaning up the place you know, because I figured hey if I'm gonna be here then I might as well make it look nice. So I started fixing this ugly yard up. And it was one afternoon that I was working just behind our cells and there's this long path with all these weeds and a couple trees that had been growing and just random flowers along a border that I made. I see this guy I'd never seen before hop the wall and he comes walking right up to me... Not really walking at first, but he gets up and starts... He does a little jog. I don't understand what's going on but as he's running towards me I can see it in his eyes there's something wrong here. So I stand up and I get ready. And sure enough he's got a knife in his hand. He tries to stab me so I hit him with a rock... And I try to grab the knife out of his hand while we were wrestling for it. But he had it out and I didn't want him to like... I couldn't get it because I was on other side of him... I didn't want him to stab me in the leg was the first thing I thought because he was swinging around it everywhere. I was using his body to block me from his own swinging arm. And uh I only meant to throw him on the ground but I ended up uh.... I sn... I snapped his neck and uh.... And I uh.... He went limp, and I got him off of me. And uh... I uh... I just killed a man in jail. I didn't... I didn't... I never thought I'd have to do something like that, but uh I just... I got away from him and I was crying. I couldn't control my crying because uh... I wasn't crying because of... I just... You know you go to jail for shit. For one thing and now this is way worse. When that year came to an end and I just celebrated being in jail two years one of my jobs in jail was I was a teacher. But because I was a teacher I could also get back over to death row to go see my friend Mourad. I get a call over to death row. I get there and Mourad had this whole meal planned out for us. There was chicken there, there was sweet dishes, There were all these little side dishes and I thought alright cool what's the occasion because, you know, whenever there's a holiday there's always food festivities and everything or a birthday. No occasion. Just wanted to have a meal with me, and this was a great meal. I always say outside jail this is a normal meal but inside Pakistan this is a five star meal. This is the kind of meal you'd have to bribe a lot of guards to make happen. Nothing was spicy. I hated spicy food. Mourad knew that and nothing was spicy. And we ate all the food, we shot the shit, we played poker, we played chess, we talked about life. I hung out that day, I hung out a long time that day. I hung out forever. When I got called back to my cell later on that day I told Mourad: "Hey, I'll see you next week." He says Inshallah. Inshallah means "God willing". It's a normal saying in Pakistan or in Urdu. It's "Hey, you'll get out of here soon, Inshallah." Or "Hopefully the judge will go easy on you soon, Inshallah." "I'll see you next week, Inshallah." And the next morning he was hung. He'd... shared his last meal with me. He had it prepared so that I'd enjoy it not him. And... And he didn't tell me. One day, Joey Paul Jensen knocks on my office and she said: "You know Sherry I have this gentlemen his name is Scott, I forget his last name, but I have this gentleman who went to school with the son of the president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf's son." Mr. Musharraf says to me: "So what is it you would like me to do?" And I said: "I have here a letter that I would ask that you present to your brother." You know, president Pervez Musharraf. "Ask him for clemency for my son." She was using every resource she had just personally, socially, and financially and that wasn't an endless pipeline. And so it was fortuitous that I knew this person that somehow was connected in ways that I couldn't even describe. Because I don't even know if he could even say what all of those connections actually are. My foundation, the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, specializes in trying to secure the release of prisoners of conscience, prisoners of war from foreign countries, from dictatorships. We've been doing this for close to 20 years throughout my career. And I felt that somehow somebody had to speak up for this young man. The government was trying to help but we have a lot of interests with Pakistan. We're allies, we have military interests, intelligence interests at the time. We wanted Pakistan's help in defeating the Taliban. So there was a lot of security interests and sometimes the U.S. government doesn't want to get those interests in jeopardy by pressing on the release of a young man like Erik. And I felt that I still had relationships in Pakistan, I'd been there many times, I knew high level people. They had actually helped me when I was U.N. ambassador have a dialogue with the Taliban that resulted in a short-term ceasefire and some advancements. And so I knew enough of the leaders there that I got involved. I get a visit from my lawyer and I tell him okay we're going to go to the courts and we're going to see what we can do. As we were coming out of two-cell and up the path one of the deputy superintendents and all his numberdards started praying for me. And literally as I was walking up to the front of the prison all the guards and different prisoners were in unison just giving me a nice little blessing. And I thought to myself wow this changed. When I came in here, I came in swinging. And here I was with potentially good news about to be given to me. I might be leaving soon. And here's everyone whose attitudes have all changed towards me. It felt... It felt good. I appreciated that. But also I didn't want to get my hopes up. I kept telling myself: "Erik if it's bad news and you to end up being here for seven years you can do it. Everything's going to be fine. You've made a good life for yourself here." I always reminded myself it could always be worse. I just didn't want to get my hopes up. And as I went into the front office and down the hallway I started questioning myself, what if, though? What if? What if? And I go around the corner towards the Superintendent's office and it was the prison doctor that came around the corner and was crying, he says: "Erik, you're going home." And I was like: "Thank you." Sherry, what's going through your head right now? Oh I'm... I'm just trying to hold myself together. I can't believe it's really happening. You alright? Erik, how does it feel to be home? It's uh, it's new, it's wonderful, The best Christmas gift I could ever ask for. In that moment when I saw him, it was emotional. Usually I don't cry. I'm a military guy I don't... But it was rough. So good when I saw him, I just cried. I was overcome, you know. We were just completely... Our breath was taken away. To be able to see him in person. But I understand that Rai Ghazarian is out there still. If Rai was sitting here right now... Honestly I... I don't even know what I would say. I'd be absolutely disgusted. I think he's a horrible person that was never punished for what he did to Erik. I think he's heartless and I think it's really sad that he got away with what he got away with. He hurt a lot of people. I hope that God puts him straight into the Hades. I was so mad. I told his mom: "Oh my God, I don't want to see this guy." I just don't want to see him. Have you ever seen him since? Oh my God, never, ever. I saw him from the gym before the incident and after that never. If I saw that guy I wouldn't let him go with one choke. I'll be honest with you. Until they take me into jail. Because he was sneaky and he was an asshole. From the beginning he was planning to take that person to prison. Lorna and I, we found... The private investigator found the information and so we called him and we spoke to... What was it, Lorna, his girlfriend or something? His wife? She said she would take the number and call back. So then I missed an 8-1-8 number. And so then I call him back and everything he said, I have it all recorded, was to me legitimized that this definitely isn't him and that the P.I. like this is who they found before... And so I'm like another failed lead like a dead end of course. And then remember how we found the Linkedin page? - Yeah - So I go to Linkedin and I wrote him, let me see... "I'm making a documentary about Erik Aud√© and I'd like to interview you. I would like to give you a chance to tell your side of the story. I can be reached at... I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your time." So then, shortly after I keep checking the message because you can see when it's seen. And I see that it's seen. And now his profile is not available and he's completely deleted himself from Linkedin. So he clearly read my message and he does not want to be found and he doesn't want to be part of this. And the reason he doesn't want to be part of this is because the judgement, the civil suit that Erik had against him... He owes him money so he wants to stay hidden. And then what happened moving forward into present day, did you guys maintain a friendship or try to have a relationship? We tried shortly, you know. We tried when he got home. It was hard. I don't think I fully could be the person that he needed me to be at that point. We had these ideas in our head of who the other person was and I felt like I could never live up to the pedestal that he kind of put me on. And so after he got home we just ended up fighting. 'Cause I didn't feel like I could be... I didn't feel like I was giving him what he needed and I didn't feel like I was getting what I needed. My first couple days back I wanted to get my life back together. My high school football coach he let me use his car. I asked him... I told him I'd get it back to him that night. He goes: "Just get your life back." So he let me borrow his car that week. And Simo took me out for lunch, paid for it. I had no money in my pocket, nothing. And when I was getting back in my car Simo took a hundred bucks out and he tried to give it to me and I wouldn't... I didn't want to take it and I wouldn't have taken it either. But he's such a massive man, he was able to put it in my pocket and force me into my car and close the door. And I needed that hundred dollars. He knew I needed it. But I saw a sign off the freeway that said Hollywood Park Casino. So I thought, you know what, I'll kill some time, just until traffic winds down, and I'll see what I can do with fifty dollars. I stay all night and I leave with 2,600 dollars in my pocket. Poker just happened to be my life raft to get my back together. He bounced back really quickly because he made that a determination for himself. It was a traumatic experience while he was there but now he's making the best of a bad situation. I'm just like really inspired by him. That someone can go through that and still come back the way that he has. to see him come back and pick up where he left off, like it was nothing, well that's admirable. And I have the utmost respect for him and love for him. Erik usually puts on a stunt happy hour every Thursday night out here. This guy has the heart of a diamond and gold combined. Extremely friendly. Extremely kind. Introduced me to everybody. And the kind of stunt work I do, Normally I don't interact with guys that look like him. So I was a little nervous coming in and he's just a really friendly guy and I've come to these things ever since. And built up a real good friendship with the guy. He's awesome. You would never know something that traumatic happened to him. And he's definitely not a bitter guy. Quite the opposite. Outgoing, non-filtered. And just... He's awesome. Yeah, you couldn't see that history off of him at all. So... I don't know how he does that. That makes him a superman in my opinion. When he told me this story I was thinking: There's no way, that can't be real and you're normal? When you go through that kind of devastation in your life, mental torture and physical torture. The combination of the two, that's hard to put behind you. And he's definitely put it behind him for sure. I definitely would say Erik is a lot stronger having gone through what he's been through. I do know that Erik gets a lot of people that say negative things as well. A lot of people will just randomly send him messages on Facebook or Twitter and say horrible things, that they don't believe him, that he's a liar, which I find horrific. I don't know how you could just say that to somebody you don't know. For the people out there, and they would say: "Oh, come on maybe he knows about it, he's not stupid." Trust me. A zillion percent he doesn't know. You know here's the reality of it. If he knew what he was doing he would just say it at this point. He's back here, there's nothing he can lose, you know. And Erik's that guy where he just... He may be a lot of things but he's not a liar. Remember this is a man of conscience. He showed while he was in prison that he wasn't going to plead guilty even though it meant spending more years in prison. Here's a man of conscience who believed he didn't do anything wrong. He was duped and that happens, so lay off, be compassionate. He doesn't let the negative in his life deter him from his dreams or his goals. This is just chapter two or three of like a 12 chapter book with Erik. There's going to be some monumental things that'll happen with him in the future. And I think they're all going to be good. When bad things happen to me, if anything I just kind of compare it to what happened to me in Pakistan. Everything from this point on in my life is nowhere near going to be where Pakistan was. Pakistan has made everything else in life much more tolerable. I think I've changed a lot actually since I've been with Erik. For the good. I think I've learned to relax a little bit more. I think I've learned to laugh a little bit more. I definitely learned that you can get through anything. I think you're with the person you're supposed to be with when you're a better person. And I think he's done that for me for sure. If you could use five adjectives to describe him what would they be? Oh, my gosh... Crazy. But in a good way, loyal... - Very straight forward. - Honest. Driven, all cap. - Resourceful. - Hysterical. - He loves to laugh. - He swears like a sailor. He's always been a class act to me. He is an amazing guy. Very smart person too. He treats everybody the same. He has a huge heart. Definitely warm hearted. He's just... He cares about other people. That he's a caring person for sure. He is truly a man of integrity. Unforgettable. Unforgettable. You know, before I went to jail I was selfish. I was selfish. I didn't appreciate anything. I always wanted something that was just outside of my reach. I never acknowledged what I had. If I got a co-star I'd be like I want a guest star. If I get a guest star, I wish I had a reoccurring. Nothing was ever good enough in my eyes. But when I got out of prison, I had nothing on me except the clothes on my back. And I felt richer than anything. I felt... I felt... I mean God it was amazing. That drive back to the city was just awesome. The views, the music on the radio... When I got home the things that really stood out to me were... Well, English is great, People that speak your language, that's awesome. Ice water. Ice water is gold. I love ice water. You know, a standing shower. A toilet. I mean this stuff's awesome, pillows, blankets, a real bed. Being able to run out into a cold night and run back into a warm room. Friends. Picking up the phone and talking to someone you haven't spoken to in years and just catching up like no time passed. A friendly smile. A song that reminds you of someone. That, you know, you never could forget about. Jokes. Food. Lots of food. Everything... Everything in our world is amazing in its own way. It's something that I would never have acknowledged had I not gone to jail. This year I've opened up my eighth restaurant. I did stuns on Dunkirk with Chris Nolan and got to work with Bill Paxton on training day and did my third episode of Scorpion. So I have a pretty good life. I don't have too many complaints nowadays. I take care of me. I don't let people take advantage of me. I play poker, and I act and do stunts. And I travel the world with my girlfriend. And I do pretty well. I'm pretty thankful for what I do have. And I just want to get through this life as simply as possible and be as happy as I can.
