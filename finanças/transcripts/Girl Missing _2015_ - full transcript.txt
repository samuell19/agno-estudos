Hi there. My name is Gwen. I'm here to help you. Do you remember being brought here to the hospital? Could you tell me your name? Or where your mommy and daddy might be? Here, do you recognize this? You had this with you. This was all you had with you. Sh-h-h-h! It's okay. Don't worry. Go back to sleep. Everything's gonna be okay. Hey... Hey... Hello? How did it go at the gallery? Well, I'm guessing that they loved your work and they're offering you a year-long one-woman show? Something like that minus everything you just said. They don't know anything. Your work is brilliant. Thanks. Well, I gotta get back to work. Any mail for me? Junk box. Great. What the hell, Jane? I just found a letter from Social Services in the trash. - Well? - Like you didn't read it. Why the hell was it in the trash, Finch? I didn't want you getting your hopes up. You know how these things go. One time... One time in 15 years, there was a maybe, and yeah, I freaked out when it ended badly, wouldn't you? It gives you no right. I'm sorry... really. What does it say? It's a letter from Gwen Marsh. She wants me to meet her in her office tomorrow at 1. Yeah, I know. I was holding onto it, debating whether to show you. And you clearly decided not to... To throw it away... You decided. I said that I was sorry. So drop it. Just don't get your hopes up, Jane. I don't feel like watching another meltdown. Good talk. I'm sure you're anxious to know why I wanted you to come in. I need to ask... Has anything come back? Any memories from before? Why? Please, indulge me. No, nothing. My first memory was waking up in that hospital bed. Why are we talking about this? Jane, we've made contact with a woman who says she knows you from before. Who? She says she's your mother. Hey, it's me. I know you're there. Sorry. Finch likes to steal my phone and make his own ring tone. Do you want to just get it? No, no. Please, go ahead. Here, let me show you something. This is a picture of you at age 9 from the foster home. My God, look at Finch. Yeah, you two always were thick as thieves. He's the annoying little brother I never had. This is from the woman who thinks she may be your mother. Now we want to run DNA tests, but we've done our due diligence and Social Services believes she really is your mother. That being said, you're an adult and you have decisions here. You have a new identity, a job, friends, you've built a life. What are you saying? What I'm saying is the choice is yours... Whether you want to meet this woman or not is up to you and you alone. If you decide you don't want to meet her, we won't release any information about you... Who you are, where you work, where you live, You can remain Jane. I just have to ask, why now? As you know, because of your amnesia, let's just say your missing persons case is an unusual one. Also, for some reason, the missing girl was listed as deceased, so she wasn't in the database. That's why we never got a match. Jane, I know this is scary for you, but I would not bring this to you unless I was very, very sure. Why don't you think about it? Call me tomorrow. We can discuss it further. There's no timeline on this. The ball is in your court. No. I don't need to think about it. I want to meet her. - Are you sure? - Yes. I've waited my whole life for this. All right then. I'll make the arrangements. Is tomorrow too soon? What will I say? Just be yourself. I'm not sure I know who that is. Jane, this is Sylvia. My God! My. Come here. You are so beautiful. You're so beautiful, Savannah. Savannah was the name of Sylvia's daughter. I can't believe it. You're like a dream. Sylvia had made a proposal before you got here. It took me a bit by surprise. She would like you to visit her home. Your home. I'd like you to come and visit your home. It'll be several days before the DNA results are in. My advice would be to wait. I'd love to. Let's take a moment. This is extremely premature. It's not. You want to come visit. You should probably be 100% sure first. You said they're almost certain. Almost... Yup, I said almost. Savannah, Savannah. I can't believe it! - I can't either! - I don't think I can breathe. I can believe it. Excuse me. Could you let me out? I'd like to walk from here, if that's okay. Yes, ma'am. - Hello, miss. - Hi. I'm Jane. I'm Theresa. The estate manager. This is incredible. Please. I'll get the bags. So what exactly does an estate manager do? I flush a lot of toilets that never get used. There she is! Theresa, can you believe it? No, ma'am. So, what do you think of your childhood home... Not too shabby? It's unbelievable! Gwen never told me that... What? That I was filthy rich? Yeah, guilty as charged. Do you recognize anything? That's all right. Come on, I'll take you to your room. This used to be your own private balance beam. My God, you scared me to death. Even Theresa couldn't keep you off of it! - So I knew Theresa? - My God, yes. She's been with us for 30 years. She runs everything... The staff, the maintenance. She's family, really. Is my father...? Robert passed away, sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, we're all sorry. Look, there's a lot of stuff that I need to tell you that you have to know about your childhood, all the years that you've been missing, and I will. Well, this is you. Double set of doors. Yeah, your father had them installed in all the upstairs bedrooms. If he heard the first door open, he'd have time to grab a shotgun before anybody came through the second one. Did he have enemies? All billionaires have enemies, darling. I'd hate to be the help. Well, what do you think? I love it! It's wonderful! That makes me so happy. Well, you must be really tired after your drive, so why don't you freshen up and I asked Theresa to put a little something in your closet just in case. There she is. Carlo, this is my daughter Savannah. My God, you told me she was pretty, but you are gorgeous! My God! So nice to meet you, Savannah. It's nice to meet you, too. Are you a friend of Sylvia's? You could have mentioned me. The little thing has so much on her mind already, I didn't want to throw you into the mix, too. Yeah, I'm just a boy toy. This is my husband Carlo. I guess there's no reason he can't be both. Should I bring dinner? Yes, Theresa. Thank you. That would be great. Let me finish the story! So I'm looking up at this huge yacht, right? Who do I see? Who do I see? Sylvia and Robert looking down at me, drinks in their hands, and I'm not joking here, I swear to God, Robert looks at me and he yells, "Do you need any help?" What did you say? I cup my hands around my mouth and I yelled as hard as I can, "No, I'm fine. I'm just looking for the number of a good plumber... Kind of sinking here." Man. Yeah, years later after Robert passed away, you know, me and Sylvia stayed pretty close, and, um, well, the rest is history. - I love you. - Aw! It's time for dessert. Happy birthday, Savannah. And many more. I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed, but I've never really celebrated my birthday before. I don't know when it is. I do. Tell her. It's today. Today is your birthday. Today is the day that my little Savannah was born, and I just thought that we had, I don't know, a lot of making up to do. Happy birthday! Thank you. Happy birthday, honey. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. You just make a wish. Make a wish for something you really, really want. Okay. Are you two gonna weep all night, or are we going to have some cake and champagne? - We're going to have some cake. - Blow them out. Come on! Blow, blow blow! I'll help you. No signal. Sorry, Finch. Hey, sweetheart. It's not a birthday, not officially, until you get a birthday present. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It was my mother's and her mother's before that, and you used to love this. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm really sorry because I think there's one missing. I know. Excuse me? I love it! Thank you. I think that you should really consider staying with us a little longer. I mean, we're just getting to know each other. Yeah, that sounds great. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Give me a hug. You sleep well. A consortium of Republican senators proposed a ban stating that it was time to reign-in spending and focus on a balanced budget. And now to a local girl who's search for her long-lost mother is paying big dividends. Has more on the story. A young woman abducted from her home and presumed dead just may have found her biological mother after 15 years. Sylvia Knowles, the widow of deceased publishing mogul and billionaire Robert Knowles, has been reunited with the young woman whose name has been withheld at this sprawling estate on Lake Superior. Mrs. Knowles could not be reached for comment. - Hey, Jane. - The young woman reportedly has no memory... It's me. Of her time before the abduction. Look, I know things are a little sour between us right now, but I want to talk to you. You are on the news. It's crazy. Call me, okay? But she might just be Minnesota's newest billionaire. Let's all hope this fairy tale comes complete with a happy ending. Good-bye, Finch. In other news, the city council has determined the construction... I probably should have warned you about that. You always loved this spot. I just buried your favorite dress, a lock of your hair, some ballet slippers. It's all that I had. This must feel really creepy for you. Yeah. Come on, you don't even have a coat. Let's go. This way. Does anyone else live here besides Theresa? Um, we have some people come in a few times a week to help out, but no one else lives on the grounds. Why? I saw this little girl, and I was just wondering if she was the daughter of someone who worked here. No. You must be mistaken. That's weird. Yeah, she was... Just standing around by herself. No, nobody. I mean, we are somewhat of a tourist attraction. Maybe some kid just jumped the fence, but I don't think I'll call the police. Yeah. - Is that Carlo? - Yes. Look at him. Theresa, could we possibly have tea in the drawing room? - Of course. - Thank you. I'm terrible! Finally, after the third time I asked her, she agrees to go out with me. Yeah, your mom plays really hard to get, I gotta tell you. You have to understand that it was long after your father passed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. I keep forgetting the timeline for you must be quite difficult. Yeah, Robert died, and... a few months after, you disappeared. It was all very tragic. I don't even know how I would have gotten through losing your father and then you so shortly after without this guy. He's been such a great friend to me, but more than anything, more than all that, he's like a monkey. He's so funny. - You are, darling. - I am a funny monkey. How did Robert die? I'm sorry to tell you this, Savannah, but... Robert killed himself, sweetheart... in this house. Where? Robert had always been a little paranoid. Kept a loaded revolver in his desk for protection. Ironic, isn't it? He was still alive when I found him. Couldn't speak, of course. There was so much blood. By the time help arrived... he was already gone. I can't imagine what that must have been like for you. It doesn't matter. You know why? Because I've got you back. My little girl is back. You're my miracle. Were we close... Robert and I? My God, yes! He fawned over you. Well, you know, he travelled quite a bit, he was... gone sometimes for months on end. And you and I? I know it's a strange question to as, but, were we close? Of course we were. Don't get me wrong, my darling, you were quite the handful. I could barely get you to stand still. I hear you're quite the artist. Aspiring. Well, this room gets the best light ever. I know your father would be thrilled to know that you're working here, and you know what, so would I. If you decide to stay, you'd never have to worry about money again. All this would be yours... You'd never have to work another day in your life. Well, I like my work. Of course you do, because you have pride, and you have talent, and I respect that. And so would your father. - Thank you. - For what? For finding me. Good morning, gorgeous. Hey, sweetheart. How did you sleep? Not that well. No. I'm sorry. You don't look so hot. Are you okay? Yeah, fine. Actually I just wanted to make a phone call. My cell doesn't seem to have any reception, and I should check in with my roommate. Yeah, it's the house out here. We're too far out to get really good cell, but feel free to use any of the house phones. - Thank you. - We have a few. Hey, Carlo and I are going into town later. Do you need anything? No, I'm just gonna make that phone call. No? Okay. Do you want your breakfast? No, thanks. Take your coffee. See you later, honey. Yeah, hello? Hey, Finch. Jane, I've been trying to get a hold of you! Sorry, it's been a crazy couple days. I bet. Did you get my messages? No, I haven't had any cell phone service. What? What about WiFi? I have access to the internet in the study. The study? Yeah, things are pretty medieval. I gotta say it sounds like you hit the motherlode there, Jane. Yeah, I think it's a little too early to be thinking about my inheritance. There's something off about this place. What do you mean? Well, for starters, my father apparently killed himself in the house. And there's something else... Okay. You're going to think I'm nuts, but I've been seeing things. Seeing things? Seeing... Seeing what? A little girl. I feel like I know her. So what? A little girl lives there. No, that's just it. I seem to be the only person who sees her, and whenever I try and talk to her, she just disappears. You know how this sounds, right? That's not all. I'm having dreams about her. Pull it back, Jane. Exactly what is going on there? I don't know. What if this girl is the real Savannah Knowles? I mean, the grave, the dream... What if she's trying to tell me something? You're seriously not making any sense right now, and it's starting to freak me out. I'm sorry. It's just a lot, you know? This house and hearing about my Dad and Sylvia and there's a new husband involved. Husband? Carlo. He seems like a nice-enough guy. Yeah, Carlo Fracassi. Yeah, he's actually the guy I wanted to talk to you about. Since you left, I've been digging through the Knowles' family history. Sure. All right, check it out... Sylvia isn't the first rich widow Carlo's been married to. Are you sure? Yeah yeah. He was married in his 20s to a woman in her 60s. She died suspiciously. He got nothing. There were lawsuits and blah, blah, blah. You've got to be kidding me. Look, I know how badly you want this to work out, but just be careful. Jane? I have to go. Um, I'll call you later. Bye. Hey. I thought you were going to town. No, we postponed. We want to wait until we can all go, you know? I don't know why, but this room gives me the creeps. I guess it's all those guns. Your father was quite a hunter. I'm a pacifist myself. I wouldn't know what to do with one of these, not even if you paid me. Do you like to hunt, Savannah? Um, no. Isn't this strange? What is? This. This is your house, you grew up here, and one day it's all gonna be yours, even the crappy phone service. Man. That must be a lot to take in? Your head must be spinning. I mean, think about it... People all over the world killing each other for money, and all you had to do was just show up. It's kind of like winning the lottery, no? I think I will go get some breakfast. Of course. Find me! Can I help you? Theresa. I was just... Um, taking a self-guided tour. With a knife? Have you been down there lately? No, actually I haven't. Um, I need to go into town. Do you think you could have a car come get me in 30 minutes? Of course. He'll be waiting outside. Thank you. I'm so sick of Mother and Father fighting all the time. I wish our family was more happy. I don't want Daddy to leave again. Something's wrong with Daddy. I think he's sick. He won't play. He doesn't laugh anymore. I hate Carlo. I call him Mean Carlo. 'Cause that's what he is... Mean, mean, mean! My heart is broken. My Daddy is gone. I can't believe how sad I am. All I do is cry. I hate it here now. I hate them all. They're here. Your car is ready, Miss. Thanks, Theresa. I'll be right down. Yes, ma'am. Savannah, can I talk to you for a moment before you go? It's important. Of course. I wanted to talk to you about your Dad and the estate. Okay. This is really hard for me. It's all right. When your Dad passed, there was some speculation about the manner in which he died. The police thought that maybe foul play was involved. The police questioned you? Yes, they did. Wouldn't even let a woman grieve in peace. And Carlo? They questioned him, too. He was so upset about it, he doesn't even talk about it. Why? Nothing really. It's none of my business. Yes, it is your business, that's why we're talking. When your father died, he left the entire estate in a trust for you... Only you. Assuming I'm Savannah. Of course you're Savannah. It's very obvious. I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. Why would he make a trust or whatever it's called and leave it all to me... You're his wife. Remember that part of him being very fond of you? I don't know. Weren't you upset? I didn't even know. He did it without me knowing. That's the way Robert was, always full of little tricks. But you know what, I don't want you to concern yourself with all that. It's in the past. I just don't want you to be overly worried about anything. Why would I worry? It's just that when you disappeared, there was a dispute about the trust and now that you're back, the only thing that would prohibit you taking control of the estate again... Would be if something were to happen to me... again. Don't say that! Once you've settled, you might want to consider just reviewing the documents. I mean, it's a heavy weight to bear. I just... I don't get what you're asking. Our lawyer thinks that now that you're so happily returned... that possibly we should remove the trust and put the estate back into the family. The family being you? No. Family being us. I just wanted you to have all the information, and then you can do with it what you want. Can we talk about this another time? I really have to get into town. Absolutely! Thanks. Call me so I know you got there safely. There she is. I thought Theresa called me a car. No. I sent it away! Come on. At your service, my lady. Come on. Seriously. It's really cold. It looks like a storm is coming. Those are some bad clouds. Were you seeing Sylvia while Robert was still alive? I'm not really sure what you mean. I mean, were you having an affair with Sylvia while Robert was still alive... before I was taken? Savannah, where are you getting all this? Just trying to get my timeline straight. Look, after Robert died, yes, me and your mom, we grew pretty close, but then after you were kidnapped, that was a little bit too much to handle for her on her own. But it was years before, you know, we became more than friends. That's the truth. Look, I'm a very lucky man to have your mom. I love your mom, so I'm not going to apologize for being there for... No! I'm so sorry. Yeah, this bridge goes out from time to time, but there is a ferry that leaves from Kingston every few hours, and the last one just left. Try again tomorrow? Fine. All right. Where have you two been? I tried to give Savannah a ride into town, but the bridge is out again. Well, it's nice you had a little quality time. More like a third-degree. - Jane. - Hey. I'm reading the articles you sent me. This is not good. I'm telling you, something's going on in this house. Jane, there's something I need to tell you. I need to tell you something first. I found a room in the basement. Okay. What about it? Like a cell. Someone was kept prisoner there. Someone very young. Mysterious little girl, right, right. What if she was killed? Okay, okay. And who do you think killed her? Carlo. We both know he's bad news, but Sylvia can't see it or doesn't want to see it. She's just so crazy in love with him, and I don't know how to get through to her. Jane, get the hell out of there. I can't. I'm stuck here until at least tomorrow. I need to know who that little girl is. She's trying to tell me something. There's no little girl! I know what I saw! You're not hearing me! Damn it! Finch, are you drunk? You can't see what's happening. I mean, you can't see what's happening right in front of you. What are you talking about? That little girl, that house, your mother... What? You can't remember. I'm aware I can't remember. That's what I'm saying! You see... You... you are remembering, but it's like your brain can't process it, you know? Really, Finch? You're projecting your childhood. - You're the expert now? - Well, it's something. I mean, that's why you're seeing things, Jane. - Look, Finch... I've got to go. - I'm telling you, you're totally losing it. Like a full-on mental breakdown. Excuse me? You're just a lost little girl trying to find her mama. We're done here. But it's too dangerous. It's too dangerous. Good-bye, Finch. Jane, Jane, wait. No. Jane, Jane, listen. What? Do you want me to come home, to run back to you? Do you want to go back to the way things were when it was just you and me, like nothing else matters? - I can't do that! - You don't mean that. I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. You don't mean that. I want my childhood back. I want my family. Listen, I... I have to tell you something, Jane, just listen. Who are you? Enough. Sylvia, I need to speak with you. Sylvia? Theresa? Help! Help! Help! Somebody help! Somebody help! Help! No! Help! Savannah. Sounds like you're awake in there. What do you want from me? Nothing. I mean, I do need you to sign those documents... in triplicate. You'll see that there are multiple copies. What is this? It essentially releases any hold you have on the estate and puts everything in Sylvia's name... which happens to be my name also. Where's Sylvia? Forget Sylvia. I want to talk to Sylvia! This is between you and me, Savannah. Now sign the damn document! And then what's going to happen? You're going to let me go? Of course I will let you go. Why wouldn't I? You'll still have to get rid of me. Of course not! But your sweet little mother, well, she will die if you don't sign it, or if you ever even consider going to the police about this. You got that? I'm pretty confident we're gonna find an agreement, Savannah. I can't even imagine how horrible it will be to... to lose your mother all over again. Anyway, take your time. No rush. You can stay in there until you're ready to be sensible. Just like old times. And if nature calls, there's a bucket in the corner. What are we gonna do now? Come on, let's go! Well, come on, girl, hurry! What the hell is going on here? I've always been suspicious of those two, but who are you? They say I'm Savannah. I don't remember. I don't know who I am. How do I know you're not just another gold digger out for Mr. Knowles' money? I guess you don't! Come on. Savannah! Mrs. Knowles. What's going on? Carlo said that you left? Carlo locked me in the cellar. Didn't you know? Savannah, you're breaking my heart. Stop calling me that! I'm not your Savannah! Who the hell is buried in that grave, Sylvia? Everything I've ever told you is true. I swear. The only thing I never told you is that Carlo, he's not well. I'm scared of him. You should be, too. - Where is he? - He's upstairs sleeping. Are you sure? Yes. Get me out of here. Sweetheart, I will. I'm your mother. I would never hurt you. I got this. I need the keys. Stay here and be quiet. I'm calling the police. Damn it! I'll try the one in the living room. Hurry. Come back! I love you, Daddy. Isn't she getting big, Syl? Carlo. What? Brat. While your father is away, it's all me. You got it? Come here, hun. No! Stop it. Don't fight it! Stop. Just go to sleep, honey. Go to sleep! I have the keys. It was you! You tried to have me killed. What are you talking about? Your own daughter. What? It was Sylvia. I remember! Mrs. Knowles! Theresa! We have been together for so many years. This is what you think? I honestly don't know what to think anymore. I hate you! Do you have any idea the things that I have had to do to protect what's mine? And you just thought that you would flounce in here... With your three bags of hair, pretending to be my daughter after all these years and just ruin my life? Do you think I'm going to let that happen? H? Because that would never happen! I did not take Savannah's life. She took mine! Come back, boo. Mommy wants to talk. You should have stayed down there. It would have been much easier. Don't fight it. Don't fight it. Don't fight it! I don't want to hurt you, but I have to. I don't want to... Just don't fight it. Don't fight it. Just go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. No! I buried you too shallow last time. Carlo. Hey, it's me. I know you're there. Is this a bad time? Really? All right then. Go ahead. - Who's there? - I'm used to it. I'll just hang here and wait. No big deal. You do what you got to do while I wait. Who's there? Hey, it's me. I know you're there. Is this a bad time? Really? All right then. Go ahead. I'm used to it. I'll just hang here and wait. No big deal. You do what you got to do while I wait. Go ahead. All right then, go ahead, ignore me. - I'm used to it. - No one's gonna find you this time. I'll just hang here and wait. No big deal. You do what you got to do while I wait. No one is going to find you! Hey, it's me. I know you're there. Is this a bad time? That's it? You hit like a girl! The police will be here any minute. Okay. Okay. We'll make tea! Theresa! We'll make some tea! Who are you? I'm Savannah. Hi. Hi. I'm really... sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that... Any of that mean stuff, I really didn't. I'm glad that you're here because we can talk about it. Come here! Come here! You're so big! You are such a brave girl. You're mama's little girl. My little tiny baby girl. Who's my wonder mate? Who's my joy? It's okay. You're okay. You're so big. You're a big girl. I'm sorry to interrupt. Theresa... You're supposed to be taking it easy. This package came for you. You need to be resting. Does it still hurt? Only when I breathe. And you? I'm getting there. Give it time. Theresa... Thank you.
