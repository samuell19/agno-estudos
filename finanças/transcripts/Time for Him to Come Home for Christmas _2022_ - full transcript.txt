There you are. I wanted to introduce Tom Burress, our new COO. Oh, uh... hello. Your mother tells me you're at USC. Uh, yes, I graduate in the Spring. With honors. Will you be joining your mother's team at Etonnante? Elizabeth is in the graduate journalism program. She just published a story about predatory loans that is making quite the waves. You've chosen a field with very little financial security. Well, and the ability to effect real, meaningful change, and give a voice to the voiceless. Nothing would make me happier than having Elizabeth by my side, but she has her own path. I am really grateful that my mom is just so support... Excuse me, Ms. Athens? You have a message at the front desk. It was nice meeting you. You too. Oh, here's the Clarks. Hello! Lovely to see you. Hi, uh, I'm Elizabeth Athens. Hi, Ms. Athens? What can I do for you today? Oh, sorry, I was told I have a message. Unfortunately, I don't have a message for you. I've come to rescue you. Josh. From a Christmas party? That is not a Christmas party. That is a bunch of old men in suits discussing their investment portfolios. - That's not true. - No? They're also comparing their golf games. Come on, if we leave now, we can make the Swapping Santa. My mother has been asking about you. She made gingerbread cookies. The ones with the little frosting bowties? You'd have to come to find out. Don't worry, I'll get you back before you turn into a pumpkin. Let's go, come on, come on. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ Oh, I feel slightly over-dressed. Let's see? ♪ Troll the ancient yuletide carol... ♪ - ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la... ♪ - Beautiful. ♪ ...La-la-la-la ♪ Elizabeth! I am so glad you made it! I promised her cookies, Ma. They're in the dining room, and I put a few extra aside for you, so... Oh, thank you. - Josh told us the good news. - Oh... We are just so proud of you two. Betty! Is that your famous figgy pudding I see? Hold it, I got a surprise for you. I think it's in the kitchen. In addition to the cookies? Yes, you're gonna get so many cookies. Just hold on. Okay. Andy? You're home? Come here! Oh, my gosh! I thought you were in Atlanta for the holidays. Change of plans. You did not tell me. That wouldn't make it a very good surprise, would it? - Here you go. - Thank you. Cheers. - What? - Yes. Aw... Wait for it. Oh? Well, that's the best surprise. I'm so glad you're home. Come here. All right, come here. - Come on, - Group hug, group hug. There's room for all three of us here. So Lizzie's camped out in front of the Dean's office for hours... Well, it's the worst story. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. Trying desperately to wait him out to get a quote for our story. Okay, in a battle of wills, I'm taking Lizzie every time. Yes, except for this time, because the Dean had already gone home, and she was in a standoff with an empty chair. Not the whole truth. No, no, no, no, someone had tipped him off! So, did you get your quote? No. He's still dodging us. Well, who wouldn't, with Woodward and Bernstein on your tail? Wait, did you tell him? Tell me what? We got an offer to work for the New York Times. - What? - Yeah. Amazing. Yeah, we start after graduation. Yeah, I can't believe it. It's everything I... Well, we have ever wanted. We have an actual chance to make a difference now. Oh, hey, there's a good one. - Yes. - Oh... we are a little old for Christmas wishes. It's tradition. It's tradition. Come on, let's go, - everybody up. - Yup. Close your eyes. What did you wish for? This. Another Christmas with my two best friends. Selfie time! - Selfie time. - Merry Christmas, guys. - Cheers. - Cheers! I know, sorry. It's just holiday traffic. Yup, no, I'm heading in right now. Hi. Sweetheart... I have a very important question for you. - For the Christmas gala. - Oh, um... I like the black. Really? Or the green. That's what I thought, too. Monica called and asked if we should include a plus one on your invitation. Uh, no, not this year. You know, I think Rosalie's son's in town. You two really hit it off at the Spring mixer. Elizabeth, when is the last time you had a date? Uh... I date. Honey, you don't date. You have networking lunches and business meetings. I should really get this. You know, it'd be good for you. Meet new people, put yourself out there. You don't need to worry about me. Honey, there's a whole world outside. Things that you're gonna miss out on hiding in here. It's 10:00 a.m. on a Monday, I'm not hiding. I should really get this. Honey... Hey, Madelyn. It's me. It's been a minute, huh? I got your new number, and I wanted to call you, I hope that's okay. I'm sure you're surprised to hear from me, but I've been thinking about you... about us a lot. I got in this morning, and I even stopped at Sweeteats. They still have those caramel turtles you like so much. I miss you, Maddy. I know I've made a lot of mistakes, but I'm trying to make things right. I know you're probably busy with the holidays, but if there is any chance that you feel the same, I'll be at our spot, Christmas Eve, 9:00. I hope to see you there, but if I don't, I understand. Hello, Guildcrest Hotel. Hi, um... I received a call at this number. Name? Uh, my name is Elizabeth Athens. No, the name of the person you're trying to reach. Oh, I don't know. He didn't leave his name, actually. I just, I was hoping you could tell me. It could be any of the guests making an outgoing call from their room. They all route through the front desk. Oh. Well, thank you. Have a very merry Christmas. You, too. Housekeeping! Just a moment. He probably realized his mistake the moment he hung up the phone. But what if he didn't? Oh, well, I wouldn't worry about it. A couple days of no response, and, you know, he'll put it together. It just doesn't feel right to erase the message. He poured his heart out. To someone else. You were never meant to hear that message. I just keep picturing him sitting there on Christmas Eve, and he's waiting for her to walk through the door, and he's thinking she just stood him up. Well, there's nothing you can do about it now. You don't know anything about him. He is one of your guests. We have 1,500 rooms. Fully booked for the holidays. That's over 3,000 guests. There's got be some way to find out which one of them made the phone call. As I explained before, - if you don't have a name... - I understand. I would not be here if this was not very, very important that I get this message to him. Look, I even wrote it down, word for word. That's everything on my voicemail. Ma'am, I can't... But can you just put it in the hotel lobby, or go door to door. Please do something, it's Christmas. I am asking you just to try. Have you never had a regret that was just so big, that you would do anything for a second chance to make it right? I wish I could help, I do... but my hands are tied. Welcome to the Guildcrest Hotel. Checking in? You're back. Sir? Hart. Josh Hart. Please review here and sign, and we'll get you checked in. Excuse me Yeah, right... I'll go this way. Here, just, um, please... do the right thing. All right, here's your key. Room 314. Just right to the right. Thanks. Welcome to the Guildcrest hotel. Checking in? Elizabeth! The clerk tossed it as soon as you left. Oh. So much for Goodwill Towards Men. Who's Madelyn? I don't know. It was a wrong number, and I was just delivering the message. It's in their hands now. Actually, it's in mine. It... Christmas Eve is in three days. I know. So, what are you going to do? Nothing. It's not my problem. I did my part. The hotel isn't going to help. What am I supposed to do? There's thousands of guests. I don't have a single lead. That's never stopped you before. Yeah, well, things change. People change. You'd know that if you stuck around. Hi, Ma. There's my boy. All right, all right. Where are your bags? I got a room - at the Guildcrest. - What? You got a full house here, Charlotte, Keith, the baby... Nonsense, we can make space. I had your father bring down the rollout. Well, as luxurious as that sounds, I think for the sake of my back, - I'm gonna stick to the hotel. - No, I... It's all right, come on, what do you need? You got a lot of bags here. Yeah. I stopped at Halliday's Christmas market, I picked up a few things. Wow, thank you. You got it? - Got it. - Okay, good. No peeking. Yeah, no, I can't see anything here, Ma. It might be nice to reconnect with some old friends while you're back... Does she know you're here for Christmas? Trying to get rid of me already? I am so happy to have you home. It's been too long. I know. If there is any chance that you feel the same, I'll be at our spot Christmas Eve. -00. I hope to see you there, but if I don't, I understand. I'm in the city for a few days. I got in this morning, and I thought of you. I even stopped at Sweeteats. ♪ Peace, peace, peace ♪ ♪ And joy, joy, joy ♪ ♪ And love, love, love ♪ ♪ Let's fill the world with ♪ ♪ Peace, peace, peace ♪ ♪ And joy, joy, joy ♪ ♪ And love, love, love ♪ ♪ Let's fill the world with ♪ ♪ Love ♪ Wait, so what are your plans after graduation?

That's enough swiping. I got a job there, Ma, and I got friends. Yeah, it's home. Okay, hungry? I know. Looking this cute is such hard work. I got him. Oh... His bottles are in the kitchen. Hey. Hi. Yeah. Thank you kindly. Are you all right? You've been a bit quiet. I ran into Elizabeth. How is she? I don't know, only talked for a minute, maybe not even that. Are you going to get together while you're in town? Nah, she kind of gave me the brush-off. Fair warning, everyone, Charlotte is ruthless. Okay, what's the point of playing if you don't play to win? You coming? I don't have a gift. I got you one. You save me every time. Come on. Wanna trade? No, game's over. Ugh, please? I really wanted a gift basket. What am I going to do with two tickets to a ballet? Well, you could always take, uh, Elizabeth. Not a bad first date. A date? I know you like her. Yeah, of course, I like her. She's my best friend. And you wish she was more. It's obvious. It's obvious... Is it obvious? Think it's obvious to her? Well, you could always take her to a matinee of "The Nutcracker" and find out. Can you take a chance? I'll take these. Thank you. All of them. - Hi. - Hi! Can I help you with something? - I am looking for a man. - Aren't we all? He's a customer of yours. He was here yesterday, sometime before noon. We get a lot of customers over the holidays. What did he look like? I don't know. Um... yeah. He bought a box of your turtles. Well, that's our most popular item. We sell dozens a day. Would you like to try one? Oh, no, thank you. Best of Seattle six years running. Okay. Six years running, huh? Mm! - Very good. - Right? Would you happen to have sales receipts I could look at? Just the ones of the credit card customers yesterday. I'm sorry, I can't disclose customer information. Oh, I understand. - Thank you for your help. - Merry Christmas. One entry with every purchase. Winner gets six boxes of our famous chocolate truffles. Hmm. The sign-in sheet is just right there. On second thought, I actually will take a box of those turtles. Great. Thank you so much. Here we go again. You went to Sweeteats. You asked about your mystery caller, didn't you? I just wanted chocolates. Did you? The owner didn't remember him. Did you ask for... - Receipts? - Yeah. They're under lock and key. Okay. Oh, sorry. Hi! Ah, thank you for returning my call. I'm looking for someone who left a voicemail yesterday. He was trying to reach a Madelyn? No? All right, well, thank you for your time. Merry Christmas. There was a sign-up sheet for the holiday raffle, and customers can leave their name and number to win a prize. They just let you have it? I took photos of the sheets while they were gift-wrapping my purchase. There you go. Looks like a lot of numbers... There's six down. 63 to go. People aren't really thrilled about unsolicited calls three days before Christmas. I should... get back to it. Yeah, of course, I'm sorry. - I'll leave you to it. - Mm-hmm. You need, uh, help? You want to help? 63 numbers to go. Faster with two of us. Carter? Pete. Whoa... Come on in. Here you go. Thanks. Sorry, I should have called ahead. I'm meeting Nancy and the boys at her parents' in Asheville. Nice. How are they doing? They're really good. I wish you would have told me you were coming. It was a last-minute decision. It's really good to see you. You too. Been worried about you. We all have. I'm sorry, I... I should have reached out sooner. So how have you been? Where are you living now? I'm working out of Tucson, building furniture. Is that so? Yeah. I like it. I get to work with my hands. It's... It's been really good for me. How long are you in Seattle? Just through Christmas. I'm hoping to see Madelyn. Madelyn? You're back in touch? No, not yet... but she's in the city, and I'm here for her. I made a lot of mistakes, I know that, Pete, but one of the biggest ones was... letting her go. It's been a long time. Are you sure she feels the same? That's what I'm here to find out. In the flesh. I missed you, brother. Well, you have a merry Christmas. Thank you very much. Okay, that is a no on, "Keith Porter". You can cross off "David Kline". His mother's pretty sure he didn't make the call. David is 12. You know, a wrong number is the reason why we have the Santa tracker? - Hmm? - Newspaper printed a typo, and all the kids trying to reach Santa that year called NORAD. Well, too bad our mystery guy didn't. They'd have better luck tracking him down. Yeah. Okay, 15 left. It's gotta be in there. Who can resist a raffle? So you just, uh, home for Christmas? Yeah. Yeah, Charlotte had her baby, so I couldn't miss this one. Aw, tell her congratulations. I will. Are you still in Michigan? Yeah, I got a job with a publishing company. Mm. I was surprised to hear that you went to work with your mother. I can't believe the New York Times would rescind their offer. They didn't. Why didn't you take it? After Andrew's death, I just, um... Well, everything got really confusing, so... It just helps to be around family. The Times was your dream, though. Well, sometimes, things just don't work out the way you planned. Have you seen Elizabeth? No. I know it's a lot to take in. Well, say something. How long have you felt this way? It's been a while. It just snuck up on me. I haven't said anything because I know it's going to change things between us, but I don't know how much longer I can just go on being friends when I do want more. Excuse me. I tried calling you. I know. I shouldn't have ignored you. So why did you? I thought it would be easier, to get away from the city. Away from me? You? Andy would have never been on that road that night if it weren't for me. It wasn't your fault. The other driver hit a patch of ice. You had nothing to do with it. I was the reason he left. If I would have just stayed at the party like Andy had asked me to, it would have... Hello? Hi. Uh, no, thank you for returning my call. Yeah, I was looking for someone that left a voicemail... He was trying to reach a Madelyn? Where are you going? I'm going to go out for some air. That's it. That's the last name. I'm sorry. It was a good idea. It was my only idea. I should just delete it. I just can't bring myself to do it. It wasn't even the sadness in his voice, it was the hope. Can I hear the message? Yeah, you read it. You know what it says. Indulge me? Hey, Madelyn. It's me. I got your new number, and I wanted to call you. I hope that's okay. I'm sure you're surprised to hear from me, but I've been thinking about you, about us, a lot. I got in this morning, and I even stopped at Sweeteats. They still have those caramel turtles you like so much. I miss you, Maddy. I know I've made a lot of mistakes... but I'm trying to make things right. I can see why it made an impression. Mm-hmm. I know you're probably busy with the holidays, but if there is any chance that you feel the same... Wait, stop it. What was that? - What? - In the background. Play it again? If there is any chance... There. that you feel the same- There's a song playing. I'll be at our spot... Probably the television... No, it's too close to the receiver. It starts mid-message. Christmas Eve, 9:00... You think it's important? I don't know. Recognize the song? Mm-mm. Yeah, I know, it's not much of a lead, but... Hey, this is better than anything we've got. I think I know somebody who can help us. It hasn't changed. No, it hasn't... Lizzie? Oh, it is you. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes! Hi, Sharon! Oh, Merry Christmas. Oh, we've missed you around these parts. Josh, you didn't tell me he was bringing you by. We bumped into each other, Mom. Well, what luck. Is Charlotte here? Yeah, she's in the kitchen, she's helping me with the gingerbread men! The ones with the frosted bow ties? The ones with the frosted bow ties. I'll be at our spot... Christmas Eve, 9:00. I don't recognize the song, but it sounds like it's coming from a music box. How can you tell? The tone is very distinctive. It comes from plucking a steel comb. - Hmm. - You said the guy made the phone call from a hotel room, right? Who travels with a music box? Maybe he bought it as a gift? Yeah. We know he stopped at the candy shop, right? Maybe he made another purchase? Which means we might have another place that someone can ID him. Right. What if we looked up all the stores that have music boxes available for sale? Then we could narrow the search to the local vendors. Okay. Just one small problem. That mechanism isn't unique to music boxes. So it could be a toy, a musical ornament. - Right. - Great. Then we find the song. If we find the song, then we can narrow the search that way? You need to talk to Slide Cunningham. - Who? - Who? He owns the record store off of Fifth. Plays poker with your father on Friday nights. He knows every song under the sun. Of course, he does. Oh! They're done. Josh, go get a couple of aprons. You two are just in time to help decorate. No, no, no, Mom, we're in a hurry. We have... some time, yeah? For every five we decorate, we do get to eat one. - Okay. - Uh-huh. Don't judge. Keep comments to yourselves, please. - Here's some more googly eyes. - Oh, thank you. Sharon, this is my fourth cookie. Looking good. One more! So have you finished your Christmas shopping? Nah. I was gonna get tickets to that big Christmas concert, but they sold out in minutes. - Oh! - So... mm-hmm. What about you? Oh, wait, sorry. Were you done in... October? - No. - Mm. No, September. Oh! September. The sales start in November. You like to pay full price, huh? I like to get it done early. It's how I roll. Thank you, by the way, for indulging my mom. I appreciate that. Oh, no, your family is always so warm and big and... just lively at Christmas. Yeah, they're all right. Yeah, it was just me and my mom for so long... You know that. I always looked forward to spending time here. Question. Mm-hmm? What is that? Oh, my goodness! What is that? Suspenders! It doesn't have pants. I'm getting there. Well, I quite like your... gingerbread... frog. That is not a frog. That is no frog, that is an elf. Elf? Okay. It maybe looks like a frog. Truce? Disgusting. Wonder what happened with our mystery man and Madelyn. Have you thought about it? I like to think that she's the one who got away, because he sounds like he really loves her. Think she'll give him a second chance? I hope so. I like to think, when you're truly meant for someone, it's never too late to get it right. You know what I think happened? Mm-mm. I think she insulted his gingerbread elf. Or she could've complimented his gingerbread frog. That's true. I appreciate that. Pants! I don't know if you can claim that, but it's close. They're on sale. In November. Great. I'll pick 'em up. - Hey! - Hi. Oh! Those look delicious. Caramel turtles. Want to go in? No. Just looking. Shall we? Hello. Sorry. Hey! What can I do for you? We're actually just looking for a song. My mother said you might be able to help us identify it. Do you know a Sharon Hart? Oh! You're Gary's boy? - Yeah. - Yeah, we were... told you're the expert with these kinds of things. You know how many people walk through the door every day, humming some bridge off-tune, asking me to name it? A lot. And you know how many times I can name it? Every time. Let's hear it. Yeah. If there is any chance... that you feel the same... I'll be at our spot... Christmas Eve, 9:00. I got nothing. Well, that took a turn. ♪ It must be Christmas again ♪ ♪ I look around and see Those old signs the same ♪ ♪ But lights and laughter They fill the air ♪ Ahem! Ah. So, there's the Festival of Trees, ice skating at Seattle Center Winterfest, and Holiday High Tea at the Fairmont. Mm! I heard that's very popular. I did some research on the plane. You know, this is my first time in Seattle. What's your favorite place to visit in the city? Oh, it's been a while. Actually... there's something I want to talk to you about. The last few months, they've been really wonderful. - I hope you feel the same. - I do. My brother is hosting a New Year's party. My family will all be there. I'd love for you to come and meet them. Meet your family? Yeah, they've heard so much about you. It's the next step. "The next step." Ahem. Just think about it? Why don't we check out that tea party? Great. I really think you're going to enjoy it. - They serve tiny sandwiches. - Okay. Hello? Well, I think it's safe to say that our song is not "Baby, It's Cold Outside". WZRX has played it four times in the last two hours. Well, they've played it five times on OKQ. So how's it going? Any luck on your end? I was able to clip the portion of the voicemail and post it to a few Christmas- enthusiast message boards. I like that. How many are there? More than you would think! The consensus is it's some old, obscure British song named "Holly and the Ivy". And what do you think? I am sending you the file now. Great. Well done. All set. It's too... Yeah. - Not quite. - Nope. I'm glad we're on the same page. So... what are you doing tonight? Uh... this. Yeah? Yeah, I think I've hit a brick wall. I've gone through a pot of coffee. Uh, hey, Josh? Um, someone's here, so I got to go. Oh, yeah? Okay. I'll see you tomorrow? Tomorrow. I gotta get back. I've been here too long. I gotta go. Hey, where's Josh? He left. - He left? - Yeah. He said he needed some air. When was that? Five, ten minutes ago? Okay. Hey, Josh left. Can you give you a ride? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Don't you think you should talk to Josh first? Ah, it'll have to wait. Oh! It's locked. I think you should tell him. Tonight. He's not here. I know you're nervous, but if you don't say something now, I think you'll regret it. I'll tell him. I promise. Tomorrow. It's open, Mom. Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you are here. - Oh! - I want you to listen to something for me. What's all this? Music boxes? Oh, I didn't ruin my Christmas gift, did I? There's a song in the background of the voicemail, and I can't identify it. Can you just tell me if you recognize it? If there is any chance... that you feel the same... I know it's not much to go on. You're still trying to find that caller? Well, the hotel clearly isn't going to help me. We're his last hope! Ah, you've always been so tenacious. Running around this city, just tracking every lead for your paper... Wait. You said "We're". "We're his last hope." Josh is been helping me. Josh Hart? Oh, I haven't heard that name in a while. Yeah, he's back for Christmas, so. Do you think that's a good idea? He left. He moved halfway around the country, couldn't pick up the phone. Honey, I just don't want to see you get hurt again. I'm fine! I promise. I spoke to Tom Burress today. He's accepted an offer with another firm. He gave his notice. He's gonna be tough to replace. Mm. Do you have anyone else in mind? You. You're ready. And I would like to make the official announcement at the party. I don't know what to say. Think about it. Bye! Hello? Elizabeth? This is Slide Cunningham. Slide!

Aren't you... aren't you Tenille Townes? Slide told me a bit about your dilemma. You must think I'm crazy... Running around the city looking for a stranger. No! I mean, there's no such thing as a stranger at Christmas. I think what you're doing is very kind. We need more of that in this world. Here it is. Blue Notes' Christmas album. 1986. First pressing! "The Blue Notes"? Jazz trio. Now, the Christmas album is mostly holiday standards, but... the last song is an original.

So I did some research, and McCammon's department store puts out a signature snow globe every Christmas. Oh, yes. My mother got one last year. It had a little dog on a sled, and every time you turned the key, it played Jimmy Wakely's "Christmas Polka". Well, this year's globe plays "Time for Me to Come Home" by the Blue Notes. Wow. I can be at McCammon's in 15 minutes. Perfect. Yeah, I'll just meet you there. All right. Okay, so I'm a snow globe. Where would I live? Housewares? Maybe? No, no. Toys. Toys. Something tells me it's behind... these two handsome gentlemen. Well, to summarize, we're looking for a man who purchased your amazing snow globe on Monday. Sometime before 11 a.m. And he might've had from "Sweeteats Candy" bag and might have been shopping for a woman named Madelyn. I'm sorry, I know this is a long shot. Did you say "Madelyn"? There was one customer. He was about your height. Had a beard. Mentioned shopping for a Madelyn. Really? I suggested a snow globe. Very popular. And wouldn't you know, he said they had their first date in that gazebo? Did he tell you anything else? Just that she was in the city for work and he was hoping to connect. He didn't want to show up empty-handed. Okay, did he happen to say his name? No. Did he pay by credit card? Cash. How did you say you knew him again? He left something with us. - Mm-hmm. - Uh, we're trying to return it. Well, if you leave your number, I can let you know if he comes back in. Yeah. Thank you. Have a good one. Bye. All right, you ready? Moment of truth. One shake for good luck. Yeah. I think this is it. I knew it. Yeah, I think that's it. I think that's it. Honey, you found your song! Ms. Athens. Mom! It's so good to see you. I'm so sorry it's been so long. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. We got a lucky break. Oh, I don't think it would be a lucky break. Um, a music shop owner recognized the song from an old out-of-print LP, and Elizabeth managed to trace it to this particular snow globe in this particular store. So now what's next? Well, we know he was here Monday morning. Uh, we have to see if anyone remembers him. Oh, you know what, if they left a paper trail? Yeah. Okay. Well, best of luck. Don't need luck. Got Lizzie. Ah! He might go back. We shouldn't rule it out. I know, I can't just wait and do nothing, though. It is odd. What is? In his message... He said that Madelyn was gonna be busy at the holidays, and that's usually friends and family. But he never mentioned work. True. I just... I think there's some angle we're missing. What? Nothing. Tell me. It just feels a little like old times. You and me, on some wild-goose chase. I always thought you blamed me... for the accident. You? How? I talked the both of you into going to that party that night. I wasn't there when I promised that I'd get you home. Where did you go that night? Did something happen or...? Lizzie... Look. The voicemail said, "I know you're probably busy with the holidays." What if he didn't say "holidays"? "Halliday's." He meant the Christmas Market? Yeah, maybe she worked at one of the booths? How long is it open? Till tomorrow night... Christmas Eve. Come on. Or Santa's photo booth. Well, photo booth... West or east? 'Cause there's one at each exit. - Really? - Yeah. How big is this market? Step right up! Test your skill! You, with the blue coat. - That's you. - Oh, uh... N-No, thank you. Three rings to win. Come on! Win a prize for your girlfriend. - Oh, no... - Oh! Please, no! No. I would be more likely to win one for him. Oh! Say that a little bit louder. Don't think they heard you in the back. Come on. You're not the most coordinated person. Tell me how you really feel. That a challenge? No, a challenge would be if I spotted you two rings. You're on. We're on! I like your spirit. There you go. - Thank you. - Please... Ladies first. Oh? Oh! Yes! One. Looked pretty easy. Here we go. Not bad. One - one. It's a, uh, wrist-elbow action. Don't injure yourself. Thank you. No pressure. Thanks. Looks like we're all tied up. Nervous? Should we bet? What's the bet? I win, you have to buy me a hot chocolate. What if I win? Name your prize. You got to come to my parents' Christmas party. Tonight. You're on. Please, allow me. Thank you. Thank you. Ahem. Okay. What time? There you go. Thank you. Here. Oh! No, sir. That is your prize. I was hoping you'd say that. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Hi. Do you know a Madelyn? No, I'm afraid not. Oh. Or a, like, Maddy, even? Sorry, I don't know her. Madelyn? Sure. She works here. She's off today, but if you come back tomorrow, she'll be around. Okay. Thank you. We will. - Did we find her? - Maybe. We don't know for sure. No, no, no, we got a good feeling about this. I do, too! Oh, thank you. For everything. Seriously, I would not be here without you. Josh! What are you two doing here? Oh, we're just catching up. Did he tell you about his new house? You bought a house? But... in Michigan? I'm about to, yeah. Ah. We're taking the little guy for his first photo with Santa. You guys should come. We're going to sneak in a few. Just like you did when you were little, remember? No, no, Ma. I think we're... we're okay. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. Yeah. We're bringing the bear. Let's go. - Let's go! Santa. - It's a celebration. Family photo time! Josh! Josh. Any word yet? No, not yet. But, uh, I didn't tell her to call me or text me. I said "Let's meet at our usual spot, Christmas Eve." Madelyn came to see me. After you left? Said you'd stopped answering her phone calls. Hoped you might've picked up mine. I... I'm sorry. I couldn't let anyone... see me. I felt so ashamed. Nothing wrong with asking for a little help. I know that now. And I'm, um, seeing someone... a counselor. Been doing the work. And I gotta tell you, Pete, for the first time in a long time, it feels like my head is above water. This is great to hear. However, you should prepare yourself for the possibility that she's moved on. I've tried to leave her in the past. But no matter how much time goes by... my thoughts always go back to her. She's the love of my life, Pete. And I gotta try to make this right. It's been three years. You can't expect her to wait. I know. Hey. Come to Asheville with me. Spend Christmas with family. Can't. I've already talked to Nancy. There's plenty of room. We'd all love to have you. That's very kind, but... I know you're hoping things work out. What if it doesn't? Don't stick around this city just to get your heart broken. I'm okay. Really? Yep. I've been to all our old spots. I got her this snow globe with a gazebo and a cupola in it. The gazebo? Like, the gazebo. I just... just gotta see her. Gotta talk to her. Is that everything? It should be. Where's Troy? He's meeting us at the site. Think we have time for lunch? Oh, we can get something there. Do you believe in fate? Fate? That certain things are meant to be? Wh... Where is this coming from? I feel like I've been getting these signs from the universe. It got me thinking. If some things that happen were always meant to happen... then the things that don't work out were never meant to. Right? I don't believe in signs. I think we notice things because they're important to us, because they're on our mind. So, what's been on your mind? Well... Okay, so she works at Halliday's? - Yeah, possibly. - Yeah, we're going back tomorrow to play her the message at the Christmas Market. I wonder what happened to drive them apart? Maybe he chose the wrong woman and always regretted it? I wouldn't take him back. We don't know what happened for sure. I think it's romantic... One last grand gesture to the one who got away. Mm-hmm! And the voicemail ended up with you? Like a message in a bottle. But why your number? I guess Madelyn's and I's must be similar, and he probably got a digit off. Well, they got the right wrong number. Most people would have simply deleted it. I just can't believe you found her, with so little to go on in a 20-second voicemail. - I can. - I can, too. These two were quite the team back in the day. Thank you, Mom. There you are. You all right? Yeah. I was just thinking about the last time we were out here. Andy made us make that Christmas wish. Yeah. I think about that Christmas a lot. Just... there's a lot of things I wish I would've really done differently. Things I wish I'd told him. He would've loved our voicemail mystery. Yeah, he would've guessed that song on the first listen. And he would've rubbed it in our faces, too. Oh, we would've never heard the end of it. Never. I miss him. I miss him, too. Sometimes, I think that, um... I just had this whole other life, just waiting for me, and just that one night just... just pushed it off-course. This is for you. I thought you might like a copy. - Oh. - All right. I'm gonna take Elizabeth home. I'll be back in a bit. - You bet. - Okay. You ready to go? Oh, no. It's all right. No. I called a cab. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Goodnight. I had a really wonderful time. So... So... you and Elizabeth have been spending a lot of time together. Yeah, she needed my help. Oh. Okay. That's all this was? A favor. I feel like you're gonna tell me what you think this is. You miss her. Tell her, Josh. This could be your second chance. So... you think she'll give him a second chance? Yeah, why wouldn't she? People move on. Don't want to reopen old wounds. Even if it means losing the love of your life? No, I hope she at least hears him out. I would want to know exactly where I stand with someone. Even if it changed the way you felt about them? You can't have a relationship without honesty, even if it's hard to hear. Lizzie? I haven't been honest with you. What do you mean? I heard you and Andy that night... at the party. Heard us...? Talking. In the den. Oh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, uh... eavesdrop... I was looking for you. How much did you hear? All of it. Is that why you left? I just didn't know what to say to you. I just needed time to think. Oh, no! I thought the market ran until five. Oh, uh, I think there's maybe a storm coming. Maybe they're shutting down early. - Is everyone gone? - I don't know. Come on. Let's go. - Yeah. Let's go, let's go. - Hey. Hey! Oh, I'm sorry, we've put all our merchandise away. No, no! We're just looking for Madelyn. I-Is she here? She just left. Well, how long ago? Just a minute. Let me see if I can catch her. - Please. Thank you. - Thank you. Madelyn? Madelyn! Someone's here to see you! I'll be at our spot... on Christmas Eve, 9:00. I hope to see you there, but if... if I don't, I understand. I don't think I'm the person you're looking for. But... really? Are you sure? That message isn't for me. I'm sorry. It's Christmas Eve! That was our best shot. Maybe there's something we missed. Josh, it's too late! There's nothing... I'm sorry about earlier. I shouldn't have said anything. I just didn't want you to find out that way. Do you still feel the same? I do. These past few days made me realize it, so, yeah. - You can't help who you love. - No, you can't! Yeah. I want to tell you, that, uh... the last few days... have been great for me. I'm very happy to have my friend back. When I go back to Michigan, I hope we stay in touch, please. Right... Yeah, okay... Oh. You are going back, so... yeah. It's finally starting to feel like home. I'm happy for you. Okay, better, uh... I guess I should get going. I'm supposed to meet Charlotte soon, so... Yup. If I don't see you... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

We're Madelyn Hawn and the Holidays. We'll be opening for the Christmas concert tonight. Be sure to get your tickets, and have a very Merry Christmas. Thanks. Hey. Hey, you were wonderful. Thanks. I'm sorry, I need to, um... Are you okay? I thought I saw someone I knew. Um, I was going to get you flowers, but I remembered how you looked at these in the window. Caramel turtles? Oh! I thought it was the peppermint truffles. Thank you. Seems like your head's been somewhere else the last couple days. It's not going to work, is it? I'm sorry. Is there someone else? A memory. Those can be real hard to let go of. They are. It's silly, really. It's been years. He probably doesn't even think of me... You deserve to be happy, Madelyn, you really do. Hey, Pete. Listen, I've been looking into flights. I think I'm gonna take you up on that offer and join you and the family for Christmas. What happened? I saw her. I'm sorry, Carter. I'm not. She looked... really happy. I'll see you soon, brother. Yeah, you bet. ♪ Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ Driver's seat ♪ ♪ Praying the lights will lead me home ♪ ♪ The city sleeps ♪ ♪ The empty streets ♪ ♪ Hoping my welcome is still warm... ♪ So, you're just going to let her walk out of your life, again? What am I supposed to do? Say something. I did. Or I tried to. For a moment there, I really thought that maybe she felt the same, but I gotta stop. I gotta stop and just... be her friend, like I should have a long time ago. I think it's time I let this dream die. I'm sorry, Josh. Yeah. Me too. Well... I'm going to get another beverage. You good? I will have a, uh... a water. Hey. Oh! Wow. You were right. The green's a better choice. Mm. So, I've been meaning to ask you. What happened with your mystery caller? Just turned out to be a fool's errand. Ah, I see. Look, I know you were expecting a decision from me tonight. Um... I just need a little more time. I'm just... You know, when you came to me to tell me that you had decided to join me at the company, I knew that it was what you needed at the time, just a soft place to land, for a little while. It was so nice to have you here, beside me, and I guess I was a little selfish just... just wanting to hold onto that. These last few days, I've seen a side of you I haven't seen in years. Why are you telling me this? Because... you have a message at the front desk. Go. Go. What are you doing here? You look beautiful. I found her. What? How? She's in a band. Madelyn Hawn and the Holidays. Are you sure it's her? Yes. It all adds up. In the city for work. The Holidays. She's the opening act for the big Christmas concert. That's tonight. I know. I got a cab waiting. Come on. Yeah, they won't let us in without a ticket. Well, there's got to be another way. - We sneaking in? - Yup. Yup. But how are we going to find her? I don't know. Act more natural. Excuse me, we're looking for Madelyn. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate that. Very natural. I'm trying... Hey, she could be in one of these rooms. Yeah, I think you're right... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are your passes? Oh, we had... So, they were here a minute ago That's so weird. Where did they go? You know what, I bet they're back here. Let's go, let's go grab 'em. I need you both to come with me. We need to talk to, um, Madelyn Hawn. We have something that belongs to her. Please, it's very important we deliver this. She's down the hall. Last door. They don't have passes. Well then you better show 'em the way. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Yeah. What she said. Thank you. Finally. - Ms. Hawn? - Come in! You have visitors. Madelyn? Hi, um... My name is Elizabeth. I'm Josh. You don't know us, but we have spent the last three days running around this city trying to find you. Why? We have a message for you. Oh. Hey, Madelyn, it's me. Been a minute, huh? I-I got your new number, and I wanted to call you, I hope that's okay. I'm sure you're surprised to hear from me, but I've been thinking about you. About us, a lot. I got in this morning, and I even stopped at Sweeteats. They still have those caramel turtles you like so much. I miss you, Maddy. I know I've made a lot of mistakes... but I'm trying to make things right. I know you're probably busy with the Holidays, but... if there is any chance that you feel the same... I'll be at our spot, Christmas Eve, 9:00. I hope to see you there, but if I don't, I understand. Is this for you? Yeah. Do you know the place he's referencing? It's the Starlight Diner, where we first met. He'll be waiting for you there. He tried to reach me... I don't know what happened between you two, I just... I just think you should really hear him out. Because otherwise, you're just always gonna wonder. You said your name was Elizabeth? Mm-hmm. I think I have something of yours. Mine? Hi, Elizabeth, this is Carter. Carter Bishop. I was hoping for a chance to speak with you. I'd be very grateful for the time. I'm staying at the Guildcrest Hotel. You can reach me here. Merry Christmas. Carter Bishop? How do you know Carter? Three years ago, uh... I was in a car accident, um... and we lost our best friend. ♪ ...'cause it's Christmas in the city, baby... ♪ Look out! Lizzie! That was you? That accident changed our lives. Carter never got over the guilt. He pushed me away. He pushed everyone away. I tried so hard to be there for him, but... He wouldn't listen. No. He wanted to be alone, so I deleted his number, tried my best to move on. This whole time I was looking for him... he was looking for me. Are you going to go see him? No, I can't do that. No, seeing him would take me right back to that night. Mm-mm. Lizzie, I don't think we ever left that night. After Andy died, I... I ran away. Maybe in some way, you did, too. I can't do this. You don't have to do it alone. Mr. Bishop? I'm, um... Miss Athens. You didn't return my call. I, uh, didn't get it until now. I don't understand. You didn't leave your message on my voicemail. I didn't? You left it on Madelyn's. She got my message, and... I got hers. Is-is she here? No. No, sorry. Please sit. Mm-hmm. I'll be right here. So... why did you call me? I think about that night all the time. What I could have done differently. If only I had turned into the skid, or... left my house a minute later... I punished myself for a long time. I mean, what right did I have to be happy when I stole someone else's? In the past year, I've started putting the pieces of my life back together... Hmm. And I knew there were two calls I had to make. I wanted a chance to see you face to face... and ask for your forgiveness. I didn't blame you. I blamed myself. No... It seems we've been carrying this guilt around too long. Is it okay if we set it down? Thanks. Hi. Hi. Think she'll give him a second chance? I hope so. I'm sorry. I should have been there for you, even if you didn't feel the same. What do you mean feel the same? When you told Andy you had feelings for him, I was hurt, I was confused. I don't know. Told Andy I had feelings for him? Josh... I was talking about you. What? I was so nervous to say anything to you that... I was just asking Andy for advice. Wait... So you were... In love with you? I never stopped. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Tenille Townes! How you doing tonight? Merry Christmas!
