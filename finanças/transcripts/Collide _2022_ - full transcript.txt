Good work, everybody. Keep it up, keep it up! Hello. Hi. Okay. Normally when you call someone, you have something to say. Sorry. Uh... I was just wondering when you're coming home.

It's not my habit, Peter, to, uh... inquire into the motivations or... the personal reasons for my clients' requests. But let me say this. The tapes are... conclusive. The tapes and that other thing... they don't go together. It's not the solution. The asset transfer into Angelica's name, well, uh, aside from the craziness of it being your money... Angie. What? Angelica prefers to go by "Angie" now. Okay. Well... Angie owns everything. Now, if you want my help, you know, in, uh, trying to deal with this further, I can. But this other way, it's not an option, it's a mistake. You got my number. - Hello. - Hi. Welcome to Collide. I'm looking for a Tamira... It was a booking. Tamira, yeah.

Nah, I'm just waiting for somebody. Okay. Um... So, look, the council is gonna sign off on this this week.

Oh, I'm focused. Mm-hmm. Hey... it's your money. Manzanillas and Kalamatas, as per your preference. Oh, you're so attentive. Thanks. I just fired him. - So... - Are you from around... Sorry, go ahead. No, I was just wondering if you're from here. It seems like a place to... South Africa. Look, maybe we should just, you know, end this and not waste each other's time anymore. I don't feel like we're... Hey, you guys ready to order? You know... I'll give you a few minutes. A few minutes. Stay. I think we just... got off on the wrong foot. Stay. I'd better be going. Don't get up. Yeah, I think I'm done here. Um... I think you should put your hand underneath your chair. - Put...? - Put your hand... under your chair. That is weight-sensitive explosive. I need that calamari! Go, go, go! - You wanted to talk? - Yeah. - Meet me outside. - Okay. Hey. Hey. What did you want to tell me? Uh... Lily, what? Come here. Come here. Uh... I... It's very... So, I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. Baby. Yeah? Lily. This is perfect. This is... this is the start of our new life. A new beginning. I don't know... The drugs and everything, it just kind of... - No, no, no. - There's just something about it that doesn't feel right. - No, I don't think... - You don't understand. ...that we should be doing this. Baby, you don't understand what this is. This coke, I mean, finding all this coke just floating out there, that's destiny. Destiny? This is our chance for a better life. Are you sure? This is our time. Hey, Zee. Your shit's piling up in there. Look. When this is over, we're getting in that car and we're not looking back, okay? Just you, me, and the baby, and $1 million. Zee. At seven o'clock, a car's gonna be waiting outside. You're gonna bring the stuff in a bag. You're gonna leave the bag in the back seat. We'll take it from there. All right, just... make sure you bring the money. Excuse me? What did you say to me? Uh... the-the money. Just-just... it's part of the deal. Yeah, I know the fuckin' deal, all right? No, I just... Just shut the fuck up, be on time. Do I pay you to chat on your phone with your boyfriend while you're at work? I'm sorry, Mr. Roberts, I was just making a quick call. You steal a box of Simonsberg Sauvignon Blanc? Steal a... No, I haven't stolen anything, I swear. I'm watchin' ya. Get back to work. Okay, what's going on? If you get off that chair, it detonates. If you call for help, I will take the disarm code to my grave. All right, did you have a chance to look at the menu? I'll have another bottle of red wine. Okay? Same? Same one? Did you want anything? Just the wine. - Thank you. - Okay. All right. I have money. Yeah. You have money. And where did you get your money, Hunter? My parents, I inherited it when they passed. And where did they get their money? - What does it matter? I have money... - Listen, listen. You answer my questions. Do you hear me? You answer my fucking questions. Where did your parents get their money? My father, he worked for the government. How much do you want? I don't want your fucking money. Then what do you want? You don't get to question me. Do you understand? It doesn't work that way anymore. You're gonna do what I say, that's what the fuck you're gonna do now. This isn't real. It's bullshit. This thing isn't real. If I get off this chair, nothing's gonna happen. You know why it's bullshit? Because if I die, you die too, and if not, you go to jail for murder. You've never really suffered. Have you? You don't seem to understand that the idea of me dying here today doesn't scare me. It fills me with relief. You're bluffing. What's up, Mama? Travis! Oh, my God. I'm so happy to see you. - When did you get out? - Got out a couple days ago. Yeah. You look really good. Yeah, look at you. You're looking good too. This tie, you're lookin' all professional and shit. Thank you so much, it is a clip-on. - Yeah. - Yeah. Where's, uh... Where is Zee at? Oh, he's in the back, you know. I can try to go get him. No, no, no. How y'all doing? - We're good. - Yeah? Yeah, yeah, we're good. Actually, um... So, it's kind of looking like we might leave L.A. - Oh, what? - Yeah. Okay. What's up with that? Oh, I... it's kind of... It just feels like the right time. You got something else going on or what? Um... I don't think I should... Hey, we family. No, I know, but... I just... I mean, okay, you can't say anything to anyone, for real. Um... okay. Oh, excuse me. Uh, so... And believe me, I know how this sounds coming out of my mouth, but, um... basically Zee just... he just like found a bunch of coke. Oh, what? It's like, uh, this weird gift from the universe, you know, to help us get out of here. So we're going. That's a hell of a gift. You know how I feel about all of that stuff, but we're just gonna go with it and... We're getting rid of all of it at once. - Hey, I'm happy for y'all. - Thanks. - Yeah. - So, uh, do me a favor, go holler at Zee for me, huh? Yeah, I will. I'm sure he's gonna be so happy to see you. It's good to see you. Shit, shit, shit, shit! Fuck. February 1st, 2022. 9:17 p.m. Wright residence. Tape 1. Barely knows how to make himself a cup of coffee, and here you are whipping up risotto from what's left. Mm, Klein Constantia Sauvignon Blanc. By kind donation of the Collide cellar. Wow, that place is gonna have nothing left by the time you're finished pilfering from it. Hey, I've given them ten years and I've... I feel like a young girl. That ass moves like one, too. Whoa, careful... Yeah, baby. Oh, God. Oh, fuck! Don't stop. Don't stop, baby, come on. Come on. Don't stop! Don't stop! What does he want? Well, uh, did you see him? He's... Lily, what the fuck does he want? I... I don't know, I mean, he's... he's your brother so I think he just wants to say hi, and he just got out. - Say hi, Lily? - Yeah. He never just wants to say hi, all right? In 20 minutes, I got a deal for six kilos of cocaine... Medium-rare! Not bleeding off the fuckin' plate! All right, everybody, come here. Gather around, children. Get your shit together. We got Janice fucking Schoonfeld coming in like a secret diner. I got staff waltzing in late. I got food that looks like a fuckin' retard cooked it. Get your shit together, or get the fuck out of my restaurant. Oh, hey, yeah, one more thing. We got stock-take today and tomorrow. We're missing items. Boxes of wine, crates of oysters and more. And it can only be one of you. Walk-in freezer and fridge first, dry goods tomorrow. Stay out of their way. They're gonna look at the freezers. I know, I know. If you're so sure that I'm bluffing... get up. Get up. Shit. Are you okay? I'm gonna take this and then I'll go get you a Band-Aid, okay? Be right back. Here you go. Thank you. Please, I can get you anything you want. This is me. The young girl. Those are some vineyards. I'm not sure where. Tokai, maybe. We worked from 6 a.m. until sunset. That "madam" is giving me my midday drink. Do you know what it is? It's the wine not fit to sell from the barrels that overferment. I remember how terrible it tasted, but... it was so hot out there. I was about 11 years old. I worked on those farms for three years, until my father was released from prison and came to get me. Of course it was too late. By then I was a full-blown alcoholic. My parents did what they could, but... there were no decent rehab facilities that would take black girls in those days. They were good people... my mom and my dad. Somehow or another, they got me out of the country and they got me clean. And they got me an education. And... then they were killed. And the doctor prescribed me tranquilizers to help with the grief. You know how that is. Once an addict, always an addict. You know, today's the first time that I've had a glass of wine since those days as a little girl. But you're more of a beer guy, though, right? What's up, playboy? Huh? Long time no see, man. Look, come to the back. We can't talk here. Oh, what? Did you just tell them that you're catching up with your big bro, or what? Look, my boss sees you, I'm in the shit, so just... just give me your number and I'll call you after work. Oh, you for real right now, huh? I been locked up 18 months, boy. Remember all them times that I put food on your plate, huh? Hustled them pills to keep our family straight, and now you ain't got but a minute for me? I'm supposed to be at work here. What do you want me to fuckin' do? Stand up for yourself, motherfucker. Don't do this right now, all right? Don't do this right now? Do it when? When you wanna talk? Huh? Slave to the rhythm, huh? Boys, let me get a grilled asparagus, table nine, please. I want that linguine and clams in five minutes. Five minutes, please. Thank you. It's nothing like the poets say. There's nothing romantic about it. Shakespeare, bullshit. Love is hard, dude. Love is work, the coal mine, daily, relentless work, and it's not cheap, it's rare and beautiful and the only thing worth fighting for, but it's not cheap. If you want cheap, go sign up for "The Bachelor," get married in a week and divorced the next. This is "Love Hurts." Let's go to the line and take some calls. Line 1, this is Rick. Talk to me. Yeah, hi, this is Stu, and... - Spit it out, Stu. - It's my girl. She wants to get married. She's hassling me for the ring, for a commitment. She's not the one, huh? I don't know. I mean, I love her. She's not the one, Stu. If she was the one, you wouldn't hesitate. Next caller, you're on. Go ahead. It's my boss. He... We've been seeing each other for a few months now, and... He's married? - Yes. - Kids? No, that's the answer to your as-yet unasked question. He is never going to leave them for you. You are a piece on the side... Hey, buddy. I'm really hungry. Do you, uh... can you give me some change? Ooh, I'll take the fifty. I'll take the fifty. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What's with the face? I got syphilis! I sleep on the street! Huh? You don't like it? Then do something about it! And you! Hey! Hey! I will shit on your head if I ever see you again! Huh? - Do something about it! - Hey! Come on, man. It's your life, Samantha. You're not defined by him. You change. Forget about him, work on yourself. Call me, people, 515-6363, and we can work this shit out. DJ Rick's half-hour. He's an asshole, but he'll solve your problems. Call in now, folks. 515-6363. Okay, who have we got here? Hello? Yeah, you're on. Talk to me. I... What is it? Hey, what's wrong? What did you tell him? - What? - Travis. What did you tell him about us tonight? I... I just... I just asked him if he could take care of Aunt Gale while we're gone, you know, make sure she... Listen, Travis, he cannot take care of himself, let alone take care of my aunt. If he knows what's going on, he's gonna ruin everything. And we cannot tell anyone about this. No one. All right? These are not people to mess with. So you cannot say anything, okay? What did you tell him? I'm sorry, I just... I... I just told him about the deal. You told him about the deal? I just... He's your brother. My brother went to jail... Did you tell him where it is? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. All right, all right, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Okay. I'm gonna make this work. I'm gonna make this work. - Okay. - I'm sorry. Don't worry, don't worry. I will make this work. Only one left. It's all I need. There will be no more days after this. I see you're finally catching up. They dropped the charges that... They pardoned him. Pardoned? Do you think you can just kill a husband and a wife? A mother and a father to their young daughter? Do you think you can just blow up their car... in broad daylight, their blood splattering across their child's new school dress? It's going to now mean nothing because a group of old racist white men in a room say so? I had no idea. You had no idea your father worked for the security forces in the Apartheid government? I think, maybe... Yeah, what do you think he did for them? I-I was a kid, it was a long time ago. He was tasked with silencing black disruptors. I didn't know that. What, you were like 14 years old. Old enough to tell your 48-year-old garden boy to go and fetch your rugby ball? You knew. I never wanted to be like him. No? I'm not like him. Really? I've never hurt anyone. What about Junior Mafekeng? Th-th-they-they... They don't know... We don't know who did that. Th-th-that pickup, that was a farm truck. Anybody could have been driving it. He was six years old, dragged behind that car until he died. We don't know what happened! You can't blame me for that, please. It was... It was dark out there. It never stops. Blood begets blood. Hearts harden. Until we don't even feel anymore. Yeah, I remember... slapping my little niece so hard, her nose bled. I was so angry she spilled food on her shirt. It was the shirt we put her in because we were going into the city. God forbid we look like poor blacks. You know, to be treated like an animal for so long, till you start to believe you are one. Everybody heard about it, man. It was big news around the cell blocks. "Coke floats," they called it. $10 million coke floats. I remember thinking I had this tripped-out thought. I thought, "Man, that motherfucker Zee, he wake up early as hell. He out on the beach, fishing for them crayfish. What if he finds it?" Imagine finding all that coke thrown overboard. Then what do you know? That is exactly what happened. That is unfuckin' believable. Where is it, Zee? I'm getting rid of it. Oh, you're getting rid of it? Yeah. That shit belongs to someone, homie. Some crazy motherfucker who'll slit your throat to get it back. You thought, what, you'd just pawn that shit off on the first motherfucker who walked by with a little money in his pocket and then you'd just walk away? It don't work like that, man. There's some big weight we talkin' here, and you don't know what the fuck you're doing. You and Miss Lily, y'all will end up hell a dead. It's all good, man, I'll help you out. I'll hook you up with somebody that'll get you a good price. Why don't you help with Aunt Gale? I'm offering to help you out with this. So, what the fuck is the problem? - Look, I gotta get back to work. - Hey! You always thought you were superior to me, huh? Mr. Big Man. Mr. "I'm gonna take care of shit on my own." Yeah, right. Thought you were better than me, better than Mom, better than our friends. But now you think you're a superior drug dealer. Careful, homie. Uh, Peter, this is the part where you tell me your problems? I... I don't think I want to live anymore. Whoa! Easy there, Pete. You don't think you're being a little dramatic? Uh... I've lost everything. My wife took it all... to start a business with the man she's having an affair with. The only thing I'm living for is... an envelope from the Philharmonic. I play violin and I'm... I'm afraid to open it 'cause if I... if I don't get in... if I don't get in... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Sad story there, Peter. Wow, dude, looks like life's done a real number on ya. I'm sorry. No! Jeez, man, what the hell are you apologizing for? Well, I... I-I didn't mean to, I'm sorry. I-I-I just... sorry. Jeez, Pete, what the hell happened to you? When did you lose your fight? Well, this is riveting radio. Look, dude, we gotta take an ad break. Hang on and maybe we can work this out. Back in a minute, people. I ran with the bulls. Broke bread with the rebels. Made art from driftwood. I am the New Man. I'm Rage Cologne. DJ Rick's half-hour. He's an asshole, but he'll solve your problems. Call in now, folks. 515-63... He's going into the freezer so cover for me. Okay. - Gazpacho on table 4 and table 7! - Yes, sir! Excuse me, excuse me. What time are the evening rump end sirloin deliveries? I cannot do the meat stock properly until those have arrived. They are late. They will be here shortly. I will let you know when they come. Fine. I'll start with the fish freezer. Oh, shit! Shit! Uh, hey. Sorry to bother you. Um... Uh, my apron keeps coming loose. - Oh. - I can never get a good knot on it. - Uh... - Do you mind? No. Um... Just... Okay. Oh, here, I can hold that. - Oh. Thank you. - Yeah. - Uh... - Get this... Okay. Um... just go ahead and... - Thank you. - ...tie this. Trick is to get a good knot. Yes. I actually, um... I haven't met you before. Are you new? Oh, uh... my name's Mr. Smith. Janice Schoonfeld called us in, wanted an independent stock-take. - So... - Oh. I think they suspect the manager has got his fingers in the till. What? The manager. It normally always is, so... - It normally always is? - Yeah. That's good to know. Um, I do need my... I need this back. Oh! Yeah, this does belong to you. - Thank you so much. - No worries. And, uh, I need to get into the seafood freezer. - The seafood freezer? - The... Oh. Yeah. There it is. Oh, the seafood freezer. Yeah. Now, I'm gonna just... Oh, of course, excuse me. - So nice to meet you. - Wonderful to meet you too. All right. Did you really think... that you could get away with it? All you whites? You could just... run away? Pretend like it never happened? That it isn't still happening? Every day. Here in America. South Africa. Did you think that I would never find you? I see you all... laughing around your barbecues. Your unaffected kids playing around in your twinkling pools while your maids clean your toilets and wash your fancy cars. This is the new Apartheid. Hiding in plain sight. And every day, with every breath, this hate inside of me grows, like a tumor. I wish there was a part of me that could forgive. An enlightened part. You know? It's not there. This... what you're doing here... is only gonna make things worse. Hmm. No. I don't think so. This is pro tea. This... You know they grow all over the Overberg. Do you know why? Wildfires sweep through there in the summer, wiping everything out. And from the ashes... rebirth. You see, the seeds need the intense heat. You know, sometimes... you do have to burn it all the way down... to start again. You're talking about human life. My life. The principle remains. Hmm. Hey, Johnny. Hey, what's up? I was wondering if you could do me a favor? Sure. You know Smith, the audit guy? - Yeah. - Could you call him for me? Why would I call him? What's going on? I just, um, I just have to ask him something, and it would just be super helpful if you could call him for me just to say that you need to talk about, like, the, um, the stock. And stuff. - You're a weirdo. - I know, I'm such a weirdo. Um, but anyway, it would be amazing if you could do that for me, so can you do it for me? - All right. - Oh... I'll owe you one. Coffee sometime? Yeah, I'd love that. Deal? Deal. Okay. You're gonna call him, right? Oh, yeah, yep. Okay, thank you. I'm gonna be right back. You call him now, okay? - I'll call him right now. - Okay. - Watch the sauce, watch the sauce. - Yes, sir. Yello. Sorry, who is this? Yeah, but I'm right in the middle of the stock-take. Fine. I'm coming. I'm coming. Hello. It is not what you think. What are you doing there? - I... - What's in the bag? I was just getting something that I left here last week. - Just let it go. - So, you're the guy stealing the stock. - I'm not... Please believe me. - You're stealing the stock. - Then what is in the bag? - Nothing is in the bag. Okay, you know what? Come out of there. Step out of there. - I think that Janice Schoonfeld is gonna wanna know... - No, don't tell her. She is gonna wanna have a little chat with you about what is in that bag. - Let's go. - No. No, no, no! Call your sister. Say goodbye. You enjoying this? You happy now? Humility never did sit well with you lot. I was wondering when you were going to turn cocky. No, really, is this how you get your kicks? Watching me beg? You're sick, you know that? And you know what? Apartheid was 20 years ago. It's over, it's done. There's no reason why you couldn't have gone on to live a normal life, but you didn't wanna move on, did you? You have no idea what you are talking about. Bullshit. I call bullshit on your whole sorry tale. Do you actually know anything about what happened to me? Your parents died. It's tragic, and you deserve compassion. But you have a choice whether you let that define your whole life or not. Some wounds just stay with you. Because you feed them. Because you don't want them to fade away. Because you like being the victim. Because without the comfort of that identity, you have to live in the real world, like we all do. You have to deal with setbacks like we all do, not have every goddamn difficulty cushioned by the long line of liberals waiting to alleviate their guilt by helping out the poor blacks... You think a grant to study political science fixes me? Fixes what? What is wrong with you? Look at you. You're intelligent. You're beautiful. Do you know how many people would wanna live your life? You see, I have to disagree with you, that anyone is gonna want my life. I know it would have been so much more convenient if I was just some hysterical woman, wouldn't it? You have blood on your hands. And it rubs off on everything you touch. - I had no idea. - No? Well... The collateral damage of a child's foot blown off during a political hit is not something the security police felt compelled to report. Hmm? Oh, God. Look at me. It was me. I was driving the pickup. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Wake up, wake up. Please, please, wake up. Wake up! Oh, my God, oh, my God. Oh, my God, wake up. Wake up! - Oh! Oh, my God. - Wake up! Wake up! Lily, I fucking killed him. I killed him. Uh... uh... I panicked. - He said he was gonna talk to Janice and then... - What happened? - I-I hit him over the head. - What the fuck, Zee! I hit him over the head. I think I killed him for real. Oh, my God, my God. - Oh, my God! - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - No, no, he's alive. - He's alive? He's breathing? He's breathing? Oh, my God. All right, um... uh... Wait, put the... put the last packets of the coke in the bag. In the bag, in the bag. Go, go, go. What? - And you need to sweep the coke off the floor. - I can't, Zee, I can't. They're looking for me and they're looking for you, and I have to go. Fine, fine, go. Just go, just go. - I got 'em, I got 'em. - You got it? - Yeah, look, I got it. I got it. - Okay. ...the bourbon, okay? Oh! Hi. What were you doing in there? Um... The oysters. I was... I was checking on the oysters for the cold kitchen. Really? You and your little boyfriend got something going on here? - Just checking on the oysters? - Mikey. Mrs. Schoonfeld's here. She's looking for you. - I'll be back. - Mm-hmm. Come on, let's go. - She's here. - Who? Uh... Janice Schoonfeld? The owner? So? Okay, look, um... It's not such a good idea if she sees you here, or really us together. Come on, what are you talking about? - It's a free world, and I'm a customer. - Angie. They are already suspicious as is, and when we open up a restaurant across the street, they're gonna know... Mikey, please don't be a pushover. I've had my fill of those for a lifetime. - This is not the moment. - Michael. Hi, Janice. Hi. Oh, I am so sorry. This is, uh, Angie... uh, my friend. It's nice to meet you. Um, could we talk for a sec? Uh... sure. Like in the office. Oh, yeah, uh... Uh, yeah, I'll be along in a minute. Okay. Great. Your friend? What did you want me to say, "my mistress"? Oh, is that what I am to you? No. Just... What the hell, Angie. You didn't tell me how young she was. I... Really? That's gonna be a thing now? I killed him. I was driving the pickup. You killed Junior Mafekeng? You tied him to the back of your pickup and you dragged him for over five miles. No. It was dark. I didn't see him. I heard a noise. I thought it was a sand hill. I just kept driving. It was only the next morning when I saw the pickup... ...the blood... So, did you turn yourself in? No. Then you must have heard about the boy's death. - Yes. - Yeah. And you did nothing. So... police just filed it under another "black dead kid" docket. I killed him. I didn't turn myself in. My father was a racist. Your parents' death were some of the many he was probably involved in. My life, my privileged life, was built on the suffering of others. And now you've come here... to kill me. And yourself in the process. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Look at me! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Ah... shit. Damn. Shit. I hit the damn accelerator instead of the damn brake, but it's not a big deal. Insurance is gonna cover this anyway, so let's just exchange information and let's get outta here 'cause I'm already late. So... I can't believe that happened. Need to see your license. Hey. Oh, uh... I-I forgot my wallet at home. What? Well, we'll just exchange information. I'll contact you tomorrow. Sure, yeah, I'll just let you contact me. Just call me when you feel like it, just make... No, I need to see your license. B-But I don't have it. Where do you live? Uh, Elgin Estates. Okay. You know what? I'm gonna follow you home. - What...? - Yep. It's gonna work fine. I'll follow you home, it's not a big deal. - Well... - Hey, look, this is happening. This is bad for both of us, okay? It's not a big deal, so just get in your car, drive home, I will follow you. Don't lose me. I think I made a mistake. It clicks off. The bomb. Clicks off at 7:30. I needed... I needed you to see me. To see the damage and pay. Then I thought, what if... what if something happened? What if something changed? So... it clicks off. I killed that boy. - I know. - My father killed your... I know, I know. I can't do it anymore. I was so tired. The anger. It's exhausting. You should go on... Live your life. So, the bomb just... clicks off? In 11 minutes. Half-past 7:00. This isn't exactly an easy thing for me to talk to you about, but, um... we did hire somebody to come in, and this is what they came up with. So, it's not something that we want to pursue legally, but... and this is not a threat, it's just so you understand how seriously we're taking this issue, um... If you do want to dispute this, then we will litigate and we will get the police involved. There's a clear pattern of money missing correlating with shifts when you cashed up. If you go the legal route, then they're going to subpoena your bank statements and... Look, I just suggest that you move on, be grateful that we're letting you off the hook so easily. We haven't even started on the missing wine and dry goods yet. When do you want me to go? Now will be fine. I think Brian and I can run things for a few weeks until we find somebody else. Right now? Yeah, that would be best. Just go. God. Don't make this worse. Thank you. Fuck you. - The same? - The same. Let me know if you need anything, okay? I'm over here. We gotta go, we gotta go. Come on. Hey, listen a minute. I'm gonna, uh, bring my car out back. I'll need you to bring the four bottles of the Bollinger champagne and the two boxes of vintage Merlot, do you understand? - Grab your stuff. - So just listen to me. Can you do that? Do you understand? Hey! - No. - Why are you grabbing your shit? - No. - What do you mean you said no? What the fuck are you doing? I said no, I'm not doing it. Listen, I will fucking put you on your ass. - I will leave you with no fucking job. - Hey, fuck you. You know what, take this shit job and stick it up your ass. Let's go. This is it. Hey, he's a fuckin' loser. - Peter. - Hello? It's Rick Murphy from "Hard Truths Half-Hour"? You called into the show a few minutes ago. Oh... sorry. I... I-I-I wasn't sure if I wanted to... No, Peter, you gotta stop apologizing for shit. Just so you know, this isn't live. You're not on the air. It's you and me. I-I wanted to talk to you. Look, humility is a wonderful underrated quality. Almost everybody I know could do with a healthy dose of it. In fact, it's because of our lack of it that the human race is in the shit it's in right now. But not you, Peter. Not you. You need to fight. You need to stop eating shit all the time. I know you, I know the kind of person you are. Sometimes you have to say, "I'm fighting back." You gotta fight, dude. You hear me? Peter? Yeah. You hearing me? I hear you. Okay, okay, all right, good. I gotta get back on the air. I just wanted to say some shit. Thank you. We going or what? What's happening? Dude? What's the deal? Thank you. We gonna go? Dude! What the fuck?! Are you... You fucking kidding me? Hey, whoa, whoa! No, no, no, no! Dude! Dude! Hey, fucker! They're here. What's the matter? It doesn't feel right. I can't be here. We can't be here for this. I'm sorry, but... Come on, Lily. I'm gonna wait for you out front, okay? So meet me out front. Say you're gonna meet me out front, please. I'll meet you out front, I'll meet you out front. - All right. - All right? Okay. Okay. Fuck. You're late. I... I know, I'm sorry. My boss was causing me issues. I don't like late people. I'm sorry, I just... I know, I just had to quit my job, so... You have it all? One of the bags, it split in half, but I have everything but that half bag. You're like a problem child. Is that what you are, a problem child? Hey, Derrie. Yeah, take 25K out and bring the briefcase to me. As agreed, minus the lost product. And the late fee. - Yo, what's up, Zee? - Fuck. - Who is this? Who is this? - Looks like I'm right on time. Hey. I'm just gonna finish up. So, why don't you, um... go to my place? I'll meet you there. What's going on? Nothing. Don't bullshit me, Michael. Please don't make this into a thing. Okay. Well, I'm gonna stay right here, then. Aren't you fuckin' tired, Angie? No. I'm not tired. I'm tired. Okay. I'll see you later. I'm going to sit here and wait with you. Then when it clicks off, you can get up. Call the police. No. Yeah. Call them. There has to be consequence. We live with ourselves. Isn't that consequence enough? Peter! What the hell?! Having an affair, that's easy. The love you're looking for... takes work. It's not so cheap, Angie. Still... I forgive you. Peter. You brought some of your friends with you. Brought a few of my friends, too, huh? - We having a party now. - Just hand over the bag. Hand over the bag now, come on. No, no, no, no, no, man. Why don't you bring that bag to me, Zee? I'm, uh... I'm gonna take over this deal, starting now? Put the bag inside right now. Eh, Zee, don't you fuckin' move. Bring me the bag. Put the bag in the fucking car! I'll blow your fucking brains out, pal! - Fuck you! - And you, you son of a bitch. - Back the fuck up! - Put it in the car! - Back off! - Put the bag in the back seat! - Zee, don't you dare put that money in the car! - Do what I tell ya! Bring it, man! - Yo! - Dude, what the fuck?! What the fuck?! Peter! Okay, okay! I don't wanna die! Shit. - Get down, you motherfucker! - Okay! Fuck you! - Okay, okay. - Get down! - Don't fuckin' move! - Okay! Okay! Hunter! Hunter! No! Oh, God. I'm sorry. Zee? Zee? Hey. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on, we gotta go. You gotta get up, we gotta go. It's okay. I'll be forever and ever... Guess love is hard to find... A true love like yours... yes, darling... ...no, no, I never, never knew.
