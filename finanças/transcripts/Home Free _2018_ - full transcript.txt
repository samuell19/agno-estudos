[slow piano solo] Hey sweetie. You're back late. What have you been up to? I just had to finish up some homework. Took a look at our finances too. We gonna make this month? Barely. Well, I have more good news for you. George is raising the rent. Shit. How much? $100. Fucking prick! Sorry. No, it's fine. He is a fucking prick. Be happy you don't have to call him dad. Hey, it's the first of the month. We know. Well, I didn't see the envelope in my room. Sorry, I just had to drop by the bank after class. I wanted to pay in cash. I have it right here. That's all right. Just make sure it's under the door by the end of the day. [solemn music] You Kent? Yeah. Where you headed? It's in the thing. What's wrong? It's all bullshit. What is? Chemistry. I'm not gonna become a scientist. We're paying to study for shit we'll never need to know. Ever. College debt makes the world go round. I think Jake wants to marry me. I'm pretty sure. Really? Well, did you find a ring? No. He can't even afford one right now. Let alone a child. But, I don't know. I know a way that we can put this book to use. [slow paced music] You sure this is strong enough? Yeah, I mean, it says so right here. Okay, it was fun to talk about this with you, but that's it. I don't want to take this any further. Look. You want to get married. I have a mountain of debt on top of me right now. Now I know the insurance policy will cover at least a million, which I will of course split with you. You said he's depressed though. Won't it look like a suicide? Insurance won't cover it. As far as anyone knows, he's just taking his medication as prescribed. Autopsy is gonna take care of the rest. The pharmacy's gonna get sued. But, that's about it. My dad gets home in about an hour. Are you gonna help me or not? I'm telling you man, baby smartphones. That's what's in the future in the next 10 years. Maybe less. Look, you've got your preteens handling all the regular smartphones now right? Plus the five to 10 year old demographic too. What about the five and under? Toys R Us just filed for chapter 11 and these babies, they gotta be entertained. So what's your idea again? It's an interface that preschoolers can handle. Nothing crazy, no words. Just enough to keep them entertained for their parents to take a nap. I just need investors, and a business man. I'm just the developer. [slow piano solo] Hey George, is Jan home yet? I haven't seen her yet. Oh. Hey did you get the money? I put it underneath your door just like you asked. Got it, thanks. Hey, when are you gonna marry that girl? Excuse me? You're what, 30? I had my first wife when I was 18. Different times. Everything's a struggle these days. Especially in this city. Why don't you have a seat. How's school? I don't know. I could be making more money spending time in the car. Actually, I had a business opportunity come up today. Tell me. Ah, it's kind of stupid. It's a young entrepreneur. He's looking for business partner. Somebody keeping track of the books, talk to investors. We're talking about making a phone application with an interface for babies. I know what you're gonna say, kids already spend enough time on their phones. They should be playing outside more like the good old days. Hey, fuck that. I broke my arm three times playing outside when I was a kid. I just wanted to ask you how I can invest. What? You know, I don't have that much time left. And I have more money than I know what to do with. And I don't want to leave it with my daughter. She would just piss it away on crap. She's always managed to fuck up a good thing. But I see in you, a bright, young, capable man. Somebody that I would feel comfortable working with. I don't know what to say. How much start-up cash do you need? I haven't really thought it through that far. It all just kinda came up today. Just give me a number. 100,000. Done! And I'll invest one million dollars in three months after you show me that you could make a prototype. Are you serious? Yeah, like I said, what the hell I'm gonna do with all this money? I don't travel. My daughter's shitty. You know, I just want to go out on a high note. You would just be helping me just the same. You know, I never told anyone but my second wife had three miscarriages. Way before for Martha. And I've always felt, you know, responsible for that. I don't know why. That's why I've been taking those fucking pills for all these years. You know, guilt's a hell of a thing to carry. Hey George, thank you so much. I won't disappoint you. I know you won't. Just see that you get your business partner to come over tomorrow and we'll go through all the details. First thing in the morning. Great, great. I have some great news. So do I. Really? Okay, same time on three. Ready? One, two, three. We're getting married! [slow paced music] [rain tapping] Nice fucking day for a picnic huh? [slow paced music] You wanna come back and join us at the picnic? It's so stupid. It's not stupid. It's a celebration. You know, we all care about you. Nobody cares about me. They should have just let me die at that damn hospital. You're going to be fine, okay. You just need to be taking your pills. Get those damn pills away from me! You know, as soon as we get home, I'm gonna call my lawyer and we're gonna sue that pharmaceutical company. Okay, just don't do anything drastic until you've given it some time. Drastic? My heart stopped for five minutes. Melanie, you know I'm not overreacting. Someone's gonna have to be held responsible for this. Now the hospital said it was the prescription. Why would they lie about that? Hey, what's the matter? I know the weather's shitty, but we're supposed to be celebrating here for George. Oh, I'm sorry guys, I lost my appetite. You can stay if you want. But we drove here together. What did I say? She'll be fine. I'll go talk to her. What the hell are you doing? No one suspects a thing, so don't give them a reason to. Okay, but he could have died Jan. He could have actually died. But he didn't. And this whole thing was your idea in the first place. Excuse me, but I wasn't thinking clearly. I mean, do you see how messed up this whole thing is? I think I need to confess. Don't even think about it. I have too okay. It's eating me up inside. Look, there is no evidence here without a confession. You mention one word and we're both in jail and you break your fathers heart. Is that what you want? No. Jake's app is gonna take off once he gets the investment from George. So don't worry about the money anymore. There'll be plenty to go around. So, let's just sweep this whole thing under the rug and pretend like nothing ever happened. Okay? Okay. All right. Now let's get back to the group and have some fun. Right? Yeah. I think we can improve the color scheme on the menu. Yeah, it needs to be brighter. Babies love bright. I agree, but then we'd have to hire a designer, a programmer, somebody to handle the... Yeah, so? So, we don't have the money for it. Wait, I thought you said that George was going to invest a million after the prototype? We have the prototype right here, what's the problem? I know he said that, but I don't know anymore. He hasn't brought it up ever since the incident. And I don't feel comfortable asking him about it right now. Okay, so what are we supposed to do? Just wait here? Just sit here with our thumbs up our asses? Look man, I got bills to pay. It's not that simple. Actually it is. All right, he laid the groundwork for this deal. We delivered and now it's his turn to do his part. You can't be sensitive when something this big is riding on the line. It's bad business. All right I'll ask him. Shit. Where's he going? Your man's about to get paid. [thunder cracking] Hey guys. Melanie, could I have a quick word with George in private? Sure. Thanks, I'll see you back at the picnic in a few minutes. Take your time. So, how are you feeling? Still having some chest pain? It comes and goes. I see. Look, I know this isn't the greatest time to be asking you, but I was wondering about your investment in our application. We delivered the prototype on time just like you wanted and now it's time to turn it into something bigger. And that takes, well it takes money. What did you guys do with the initial $100,000 I gave you? Look, we're grateful for that but we used it all to make the prototype and we need the investment now to grow. There's nothing I can do anymore. What? The last month has been very unexpected. I'm up to my elbow with medical bills. And my daughter is a mess. I'm gonna have to take it easy with everything and be more cautious with my money now. Are you serious? Harry and I have been working on that app non-stop for the last month. And it has the potential to be something really great. We put everything into it on the assumption that you would follow through on your word! I'm sorry. I just don't know what to tell you. Fucking unbelievable! Everything okay? Just peaches. Pack your shit Jan, we're leaving. What? Let's get out of here. Sorry guys, you're gonna have to find a lift or something. Seriously, babe, what's the matter? George isn't giving us the investment. What? His money's all tied up in hospital bills and other shit. And he just lost interest. We'll see about that. [thunder cracking] He can't do this. Didn't he sign a contract? Nope. He just gave me his word which apparently isn't worth shit now. That damn app has you further in debt. What are we supposed to do now? Cancel the wedding? What do you want me to do Jan? Put a gun to his head? Rob him? It's over. Martha showed me his will. What? She found it. The other day in his office. Yeah, so what? He included you in it. Right after his wife and daughter. No. No way. And something would have to happen to Martha and Melanie for it to even be worth it. Out of the question. I have something to tell you. [everyone coughing and sneezing] It's still hot so let it cool down for a minute. I don't like it hot. Put some ice cubes in it. George, be nice. This damn cold is gonna be the end of me. You heard the doctor what could happen to me if I get sick. It's a common cold. You're gonna be fine. I can't even breathe through my nose at all. How come you're not sick? Just lucky I guess. Oh my god Jan, get me out of this house. I'm gonna kill someone. I'd rather be in class. Ugh. I'm literally gonna kill someone. Ooh yes! Does that even make you feel any better? Can't sleep without it. Why are you such an asshole to Jan? She knows I'm not gonna change. If she doesn't like it she could just leave. Besides, I don't trust her. What do you mean you don't trust her? Just a hunch. I have a sneaky suspicion. Have you ever seen her eyes? The eyes don't lie. She's up to something. And you wonder why you don't have any friends. I don't care. You know, sometimes I feel guilty. Sometimes I remember that there are second chances. Like right now. Do you believe in second chances Jan? Sure. So do I. And you know, right now, I know what to do. So man, when's the wedding? Still waiting on my invite. I don't know. It's on hold at the moment. My business kinda hit a roadblock recently. Really? Wow, that sucks. Man, Harry was all fired up about it too. Sounded like a sure thing. Yeah man it was, but my asshole investor decided to pull out at the last moment. Contracts man. You gotta get your shit together. Lesson learned. Anyway, what have you been up to? Plumbing. Plumbing. Yeah. Seriously? Dude, it's the best. Like short hours, different location every day, minus working with human feces part. But it can get hairy sometimes too. My cousin was working on some lady's sink the other day accidentally severed one of the gas lines. The place went up in flames that night. Are you serious? I shit you not! I don't know, luckily no one was home. But, you know, he's talking with some lawyers now and stuff. I don't know what's gonna happen next. I don't know man. Dangerous shit. Exciting, but dangerous shit. I thought they'd never fall asleep. If I have to warm up one more hot chocolate... What's the matter? I was hanging out with Lou during lunch today and he told me an interesting story. It's perfect. They're still sick and will be in the house tomorrow. They're all stuffed up so they won't smell the gas at all. How's it gonna ignite? We can't be anywhere near here. Martha's a pothead. She'll light up right after lunch as usual. It's a sure thing. Just cut the line after I leave and before you go to work. Got it? So, I was thinking. So if we get the interface to work on the current operating system, we can make an iOS version that will cut the budget in half. Hello? Space cadet. What the hell are you doing? I've had a lot on my mind lately. Yeah, no shit. Me too. But I need you here with me now, okay? Yeah, yeah I'm sorry. What were you saying? Nothing. Look, we're fucked without George's money anyway. I know. You know, that actually really pisses me off. I mean who does that? We spent all that time working on the prototype. I didn't see my girlfriend for months. I lost probably 15 pounds. I've got bills coming out of my ass. And the agreement was already made! I know it was Harry. Okay just calm down. You're making a scene. I don't give a shit Jake! Do you think you could keep it down? You're scaring our customers away. I apologize ma'am. We'll be leaving here shortly. No we won't. We leave when I say it's time. Sir, if I could politely ask you to leave. No you may not miss. Because I'm done taking orders from people. So get the hell out of my face! I'm going to call security! Are you happy now Harry? Hey, where are you going? To George's house. Just to talk. If he doesn't have to play nice, I don't have to either. I don't think you wanna burn that bridge. So why don't you just sit down and think this through for a second. That bridge has been burned a long time ago. All right? There are plenty of other investors out there, I don't have to kiss his ass. Harry, don't go over there, okay. Why? Just because you're too much of a pussy to talk to him doesn't mean I am. Harry don't go over there. Harry, don't go over there! Harry! Oh shit. Fuck! Come on! Shit. [door slamming] Where are you George? I've got a bone to pick with you! [fire crackling] [sirens blaring] Fuck! Shit! Did you do it? Harry's dead. He was in the house. What? Are you sure? I'm pretty sure. I mean, I don't know. I got out of there so quick. They were all in the house, right? All of them? I don't know. I don't know. I didn't get a chance to look or ask anything. Well, that's it then. What do we do now? We wait. [phone buzzing] What is it? Who is it Jan! Was it George? Did it seem like George? I don't know. The number was unlisted. Give me your phone. What are you doing? Taking out your sim card. If George goes the police, we're fucked. We can't risk being tracked. What the hell are we supposed to do now? My Uber app is worthless without it. How are we supposed to make any money? That's the least of our worries. How much cash do you have on you right now? I don't know, like 40 bucks maybe. Me too. Might be enough for one night. Hand it over. What are we supposed to do now? Hole up in this flea bag motel room like a couple of common thugs? Harry's probably dead, and who knows if George... You need to keep it together. Nothing's gonna be the same anymore. You thought our lives sucked before? Harry didn't deserve to die. Nobody did. You can thank your fucking sugar daddy for having second thoughts. We'll stick around here until we come up with a plan. We'll make it work. We're still getting married. As of now there are two confirmed casualties. Harry Miller and Martha Strong with a third, Melanie suffering third degree burns. The owner of the house, George, was not at home at the time. The blaze was contained before spreading to other houses. You said they were all supposed to be home! You said it was a sure thing. It was. He's always home on Tuesdays. I even checked his calendar. No appointments, nothing. What are we supposed to do now? We make our move. George. I am so sorry. I got here as soon as I could. Have you talked to the police yet? Why don't we go to the car. I'm not gonna call the police. Well do you expect some foul play was involved? I know so. You know, I'm gonna go see Melanie in the hospital this evening. I'm surprised you're not there right now. You know what, I'm gonna meet up with her after we're done. Listen George, your message is a little cryptic. What was the urgency that you needed to see me so soon? You know I'm here to help you any way I can. I caught this little cocksucker pulling the gas lines in my house. Jesus George. Who is that? He and his fiance were renting a room at my house. I helped him with a business venture but I suddenly had pull out for personal reasons. Wow, do you think this could be some bitter revenge of some sort? Possibly. I warmed up to him. And I put him and his girlfriend on my will a few weeks ago. But there's no way they could have known about that. Anyway, I removed them from my will this morning. Oh god, I'm so sorry George. Just, it breaks my heart to, you know. Melanie and Martha just don't deserve this. Are you gonna be okay? You still talk to Robert? Occasionally. Yeah, why? 'Cause his son got recently arrested right? What was his name? Carl? Carlos. And he was arrested for murder if you can believe that. And then released on a technicality. Is he still in town? I think so. Why? What does this have to do with anything? Nothing, nothing. Would you happen to have his phone number? Yeah, I might. I do actually. Here, I'll send it to ya. Got it. It was nice seeing you Sid. You too George. This is so fucked. I'm not calling him Jan. It's that simple. Well we can't go to the police. And George has the upper hand right now. Who's to say that George hasn't already told the cops yet? We have to assume he has and hope he hasn't. At any rate, we need him wiped out immediately. This is ridiculous! Have you not learned your lesson? You were all gung ho about killing his entire fucking family a few hours ago! Why the sudden change of heart? Harry's dead now. This changes everything. We have our backs against the wall. And if we don't make a move, we're done. I've got two dollars to my name and it takes too long to hitchhike to Mexico! Unless you have a connection for passports. Are you listening? We need to finish what we started. As long as George is out there running his mouth, we're done. Call your friend Jake, he killed that... All right, all right! I'll call him. Jesus Christ! I don't even know if he can help us. Well, do you know of any other suspected killers we can contact to make a hit for us? 'Cause I just checked my Rolodex and it came up empty! Just shut your mouth for one minute. Fuck. Hello. Martin? How's it going buddy? Yeah, yeah, I'm doing great, thanks. I just got engaged last month. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, we'll be sending out wedding invites shortly. Hey look, I was wondering if you were still in town. My fiance and I are kinda in between places and we're just looking for a place for a couple nights with four walls, a ceiling. Does your brother still have that place? Oh yeah, great, great, thanks. And there's something else I want to talk to you about as well. Thanks for seeing me. What's your name? You don't need to know my name. I was good friends with your father Robert in the Army. I saved this life twice in combat. If it wasn't for me you wouldn't even be here! So show me some fucking respect! And tell me your name. [male chuckles] Carlos. I'm George. Okay George. Make this quick. I got shit to do. I have a job that needs to be done. And I got money. Lift up your shirt homeboy. Make sure you ain't wired. I'm already on thin ice with the DA. I'm completely on the level. Did you hear the house that burned down today, a few miles away? Yeah. And? Well, that was my family. And it was no accident. And I know who did it. Who and where? Jake Tanner and Jan Ivory. This is all the legal information I have on them. They were staying at my place. You know, more likely they're on the run now, but they can't be that far. How much this job pay? Whatever you think is fair. I'm not gonna nickel and dime you. I just want justice to be served. Tell you what George, I'm gonna step out and I'm gonna make a quick phone call to my pops. Hopefully, he's got some good things to say about you. Pops says you're cool. So here's the deal George, the price is 30K. Half now, other half when the jobs done. If that's cool with you, I'll give you an account number. Once that first transfer goes through, I start. Long time buddy. Long time. Good to see ya. You look like shit though. Yeah, I didn't want to say too much over the phone. Is there somewhere private that we can talk? Hello. I'm sorry, this is my fiance Jan. Well yeah. Come on. Your hands are shaking man. I'm in some bad shit right now. And I'm kind of desperate. And I was hoping that you could help me, but most importantly if you could be completely honest with me. Yeah, of course. Do you remember a few years ago when our old classmate Henry Anderson went missing and they found his body by the lake? Are the rumors true? Jesus Jake. I'm serious. I know the two of you had your differences and they never found the murderer. Look, I'm not here to judge you. You're still my friend. I just need an honest answer. Henry and I did have our differences, didn't we? Look, I got a big favor to ask. And it's not really a favor, it's more like self-defense. This favor, is it life and death? Let me show you guys the house. It's been neglected for, well, I don't know how long. But nobody's gonna come snooping around here. All right. Try to contain your excitement. [Jake and Jan coughing] Jesus, is it even safe to breathe the air in here? It's never hurt me. I used to play cards every weekend in this house. Right over here. All the way up until my brother died. That's the chair he died in. But I just got a clean bill of health myself last week, so I'm good. Well, isn't that encouraging. Just cool it Jan. Is he gonna do it or not? He'll do it. The plan is to stay here tonight and come up with a real plan in the morning. We still gotta find out where George is. That might take some time. You can thank me later miss. Come on. All right, you guys can sleep in this one right here. I'm just gonna be in the next one over. Great. [phone buzzing] Damn! Making it rain George! Ain't no fucking around with you. We're gonna make beautiful music together. Hey Murphy. Hey it's your boy. I need you to run a number for me. 0909. Uh huh. So the phone's dead but the last ping came from a motel off First and Higgins? When was that? All right cool. Hey man, I need you to do something else for me. I need you to get me the records for today from the motel. [Jan coughing] Jake. I can't even breathe anymore. I'm seriously doing damage to my lungs. You're fine. Just try to get some rest. There's black mold on the fucking shower curtains. What do you want to do? We still have that motel room fully paid for tonight. Why aren't we staying there? You wanna walk a mile into downtown in the freezing cold right now? I'd rather die of frostbite than cancer. All right, let me go tell Martin. Martin. Martin. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Shit. Every time I go to rest my eyes for two seconds I'm on saw and logs in no time. Is that thing loaded? No good if it ain't. Here, try it on. No thanks. I'd rather not. You ever fire a gun before? Never even held one. Well shit, all that's about to change. You're a man on the run now. All of life's conveniences are no more. Here, hold it. Get a feel. It's heavy. Yeah, we'll get you to a range when we got a minute. You need to learn how to use this. Say look, Jan is having a really hard time sleeping right now, so I just wanted to tell you that we're gonna hop on over to the nearby motel and sleep in an actual bed. It's already fully paid for so it'd be stupid not to use it. All right, you guys gonna be okay? You were shitting bricks earlier. Yeah, yeah. We'll be back first thing in the morning to figure out what the next step is. Are you gonna stick around? Yeah I'll be here. Okay. Hey, thanks for everything. Yeah, no problem. Look, you get some sleep buddy. This is all gonna work out. Just look at me. I'm living proof you can get away with murder. Jake? Is that you? Is that you? [guns firing] [guns firing] I don't know how your friend can stand this place. He's trying to help us. Can you not be so bitchy around him? Sorry! It's not like our lives are on the line or anything. Besides, how is he really gonna help us? Sit on the porch with a shotgun? I can do that. Look, I alluded to the possibility of him taking out George. But I gotta come up with a better approach. We don't have anything to pay him and our friendship is not that rock solid to begin with. We're lucky he didn't run for the hills when I told him what happened. Martin. You here? Jesus Christ! Who is that? Jake, do you know who that is? I have no idea. We should get the guns. We don't even know how to use them. It's time we learned. Come on, pick them up. Don't look so worried. They can't hang us twice. [slow paced music] You couldn't even have bothered to pick me up inside? I didn't wanna draw any attention. How bad is it? [engine turns] Do you think you could spare a little? What's your deal? Lose your job? Yeah. And I've got a one year old to take care of. Well where is it? A friend of mine is looking after him today. Do you think you could spare some? Well I don't have any money on me right now, but I go to open shop in about 10 minutes. Why don't you follow me there and I could give you some money once we're there. It's right around the block here. [slow paced music] So what kind of shop do you run again? Oh it's a pizza place. Family business. [ominous music] You scream bitch, and it's over. Lay down on the ground. Lay down on the ground. A one year old, at a friend's place? Do I look like I was born yesterday? [Jan breathing heavily] [gun firing] [man grunting] Hey. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Get anything to eat? No. I mean yeah. I ate it already. So, how much did you pull today? I don't know, like a couple bucks maybe. Oh. Well I pulled about 50 give or take. So maybe by tomorrow we can afford a room or maybe a rental car. Oh yeah. So I guess we should get back to it then huh? Yeah. Right, I'll see you for dinner. [slow paced music] Why are we at your ex-wife's house? She's all broken up over Martha. Besides, she could use the company. She did say we could stay here until we find another place. Wonderful. [door knocking] [sirens blaring] Hi Hailey. Hi George. Have you made arrangements for the funeral yet? Yes. They're for next Saturday. Are you okay? I don't know. It just hasn't hit me yet. Melanie, sweetie, is there anything that I can get for you? No. I'm just gonna go to the other room. I am so sorry. Hailey, sweetie. Why don't you go get dinner ready. Just like her half sister. You know, I could smell the booze on your breath earlier today. I had one sip. Sure you did. And what about you? What the hell were you up to all day and how did you score so much more than me? They're called boobs Jake. Yeah. Everyone loves the whore. Excuse me? If I find out you're turning tricks... You fucking asshole! Fuck off! Oh shit! Come on Jan! Where are you goin? It's the middle of the fucking night. God damn it! I can't sleep. I've been trying to find a better time to tell you this. But I might as well tell you right now. I'm moving in with Paula and Hailey. I've been thinking about this for a while. And I've never stopped loving her. I have to be completely honest with you. I can't have a wife who's disfigured. I've been trying to convince myself of all the reasons why I should, but I would only be fooling myself. Aren't you gonna say anything? How did you know to leave the house before it burned down? You never leave the house on Tuesdays. I caught Jake messing with the gas lines. What I didn't know, was how he found out about the will. Unless you told him. And you just let your daughter and I burn? I was thinking about getting back with Paula for a while. And this seemed like the perfect opportunity. Martha's been a mess. But I could start fresh with Hailey. [Melanie sobbing] I reserved a hotel room for you, and I can arrange for someone to take you there. [Jake coughing] Really Jake? I need something to help me get through the day Jan. I can't take this shit! Hey, what are you doing? Spent $20 on that shit! I need you sober right now. I have enough shit to deal with at the moment without you blitzed out of your mind. 500 bucks. I was at the library earlier today and I found somebody on Craigslist to sell us a clunker. Where did you get that money? Don't worry about it. Where's your ring? In my pocket. Let me see it. I pawned it so we can get a car. You did what? It's just a ring. We're still getting married. God. I can't believe you did that shit. Yeah, well, desperate times call for desperate measures. Now we need to be in Hayward by noon so we can look at the car and then we can head straight for the Border. I'm not going. Seriously Jake, I'm not in the mood for your shit right now. I said I'm not going! [ring clanking] Okay, now you're just being childish. I can get my ring back later, but we need to fucking car right now! I'm done Jan. Knock it off. Goodbye. Jake! Come back! Jake! Motherfucker! Industry or not, the city of San Francisco... [door knocking] May I help you? Hello, are you Paula Weaver? Yes I am. Yes, I'm looking for George Meadowwood. Is he here? May I ask what this is about? Yes, we got an anonymous tip earlier today that he burnt down his house in order to collect on insurance money. We're just following up on it. Usually we would disregard such calls, but coincidentally, we found his name scribbled on a note which was found on a murder victim along with another suspect. Oh my god. I just have a few questions to ask him, that's all. You know, George might not be the friendliest person in the world, but he would never be involved in something like this. And I'm sure this is all just a big misunderstanding, but we have to cover our bases. Is he here? Yes he is. You're welcome to come in if you'd like. George. There's someone here to see you. Let me go check in the back. Okay. [solemn music] [Jan sobbing] Hello Jan. Melanie! Do you have anything to say for yourself? Oh my God, your face. Is that all? I, I... How did you find me here? You always loved this park. I figured it'd be the first place to look. I'm so sorry. I called the cops earlier today. I told them that you and Jake participated in a premeditated murder. I also had a strong heart to heart with George last night. He's planning on having you both killed as soon as he finds you. Why are you telling me all this? Maybe it's because the three people that I cared the most about, tried to kill me. Maybe it's because I'm going to look like a monster for the rest of my life. Maybe I'm just crazy. Melanie, there is not a minute that goes by that I don't regret what I did to you. This is for you, Jake, and George. Melanie, what are you doing? Melanie stop! [gun firing] [solemn music] [gun firing] [ominous music] Come on! Jan Ivory! Put your hands up! What? Yeah, that's right. Put your hands back here. Don't you move. Stay right there up against there. Don't you move. Don't you move. Shit! Don't move, don't move. Okay. Let's see what you got here. There's nothing in there. Oh yeah? Oh yeah, nothing huh? Okay. Why don't we just take this little nothing downtown. Let's go. Look, I don't know what you're talking about. How many times do I have to say it? Okay look, we have it from a very reliable source that you and your boyfriend were responsible for the fire. And low and behold, our source ends up dead. She was nuts. There were witnesses at the park. I didn't do it. Now look, I'm not saying that you killed her. But I am curious as to why you have this gun in your purse. I carry it for protection. Got a permit for it? Protection from what? Look, what do you want from me? I can't help you. Do you know who Ajmal Batal is? No. Well we found him earlier with his pants around his ankles. Yeah. And the caliber of slugs that we pulled out of him match your gun. Surveillance footage from the parking lot next door clearly identifies you. Now if I were you, I'd start talking. Because if you don't, you're just gonna dig a deeper hole for yourself. He was raping me so I shot him. And so when were you gonna report this? I was traumatized. I wasn't thinking clearly. I was planning on making a call later today. Oh, so self-defense right? Of course it was. Sure. Well you know, why don't we just do a little play by play here. Shall we? Oh yeah, that's right. Oh yeah. See that? That's Ajmal Batal forcing himself on you, right? And then all of a sudden, bam! You shot him. He goes down. Now this gives you an awesome opportunity to get away and perhaps call the police, right? He's now incapacitated and no longer a threat for you. Oh, what's that? You shoot him again. Put a bullet in him killing him. But now you're robbing him. Oh that's murder. No way around it and all day long. You are serious. I get assaulted and now I'm in trouble. Hey, tape don't lie. Now we already know that you're responsible for that fire. So you're looking at consecutive life sentences and possibly the death penalty. What are my options? Confess to the fire, turn in your partner. I'm sure the jury's gonna go easy on you. And I'll see if I can get you a reduced sentence. You know it's the right thing to do. [slow paced music] Hey sweetie. I thought I'd find you here. I was thinking about going to the pawn shop and getting my ring back. You wanna come with me? The whole car thing fell through so I still have the cash to buy it back. I figured we could put them back on at the same time. All right. What's your deal? What do you mean? This whole ring thing. You're acting weird. What is it Jan? Tell me. There's cops waiting for you in the pawn shop. What? Melanie told the police everything, and then she shot herself right in front of me. Jesus Christ. Are you kidding me? I cut a deal if I turned you in. I'm so sorry. I can't do it. Just, Jake just take off. I'll think of something to tell them. What about you? I'm going to jail either way. So this is it then. Be careful. They have some men watching us right now. Goodbye. I love you. I love you too. Where is he going? I told him to run. You're making a big mistake. Keep on him, don't let him get away. Turn around. [baskets clanking] [horn honking] Hi ma'am, I'm gonna need your coat. What? I need your coat. No. Just give me your god damn coat! Oh my god! [door knocking] They killed Carlos. Come in George. [slow paced music] Have you talked to Robert? Does he know that his son is dead? Yeah, he mentioned it to me. Police told him that you're their main suspect. You know I didn't do it. Oh I know that George. It didn't cross my mind for a minute. Well, we gotta keep moving. You said they're on the run right? Do you have any idea where we can find them? I was still hoping you had your contacts with the department. Melanie said she was gonna talk to the police. And maybe they have some leads by now. I'll make a few calls. There's a gun to your back right now. Just give me your keys and don't turn around. Walk away. I'm sorry sir. I don't like having to do this. Just walk away. Shit. [engine turning] I just got off the phone why my buddy in the department. He told me that a call just came in from a guy reporting his car being hijacked. From the description, he said it sounded a lot like Jake. Which way was he headed? Oh, I have no idea. Your guess is as good as mine. He's probably just running scared. What about Jan? Well Jan Ivory is in custody. She's waiting to be transferred to a new location this evening. And as luck would have it, my guy is doing the transporting. He said that we can have five minutes with her, but not much more. If she arrives late they start asking questions. [somber music] Well that's gotta be them. George stay cool. My buddy is really sticking his neck out for me on this one. I just want to talk to her. Maybe she knows where Jake is. He's the one that I want. All right, I'll wait in the car. Wave if you need something. You George? All right, you got five minutes. No more no less. Got it? Are you strapped? Let's have it. You'll get it back. She's in the backseat. Where's Jake? How much of this was your idea to kill me? You were Martha's only friend. Doesn't that mean anything to you? I just wanna let you know I plan on killing you and Jake. Maybe not now, but soon. If you tell me where he is, I'll go easy on you. If not, I'm gonna draw this out as long as I can. I trusted Jake and you. I thought that Jake really liked me. Nobody likes you George. Nobody. Not Martha, not Melanie, not Jake, and especially not me. Did you know Martha and I tried to kill you before the fire? Even before the initial investment. It wasn't a pharmaceutical mix-up. We put chemicals in your fucking prescription. That's how much we hate you. No. No, I don't believe that. Martha, she would never do that to me. Pharmaceutical mix-up. Is that what you keep telling yourself? Are you really stupid enough to believe that? You're better off dead for everyone. Did you know Melanie killed herself? She'd rather be dead than have to deal with you. And Jake? It didn't take much convincing to get him to cut that gas line. No one likes you and you're gonna die alone, a sick old man with nothing but a pile of money that isn't worth Jack shit! [heavy breathing] [Jan gasping] Christ. Jesus! Get over here! Get out! Get out! Get out of the car! Hands on the car. What the fuck is the matter with you huh? What is your problem! [Jan gasping] Mel, get off. Sidney you gave me your word. I'm sorry Mel. What the fuck man. Get your friend and get the hell out of here. 'Cause I swear to God, if this comes back on me, if they say anything about the marks on her neck, I'm not taking the fall for this. I'll give you up in a heartbeat. Understood. I can't tell you enough how sorry I am. Just go. Come on George. Jesus Christ. I told you not to lose your head. The one thing I asked of you. Sorry, sorry. Just take me home. Come on. Fuck. Say George, what do you say we just call this whole thing off? We don't have any leads on Jake and Jan is just gonna spend the rest of her life rotting away in a cell somewhere. We'll find Jake. All right. Sid. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, what is it? Do you hate me? What kind of a question is that George? I'm risking my life here to help you. I'm gonna go to bed. Hello. Can I get Hayward PD please? Thank you. Hayward PD. Yeah, when are your visiting hours? Excuse me? I was just wondering when your visiting hours were. I just wanted to speak to someone there. How does that all work? Do I need to make an appointment or something? Who are you trying to reach? I'll check. Janet. Janet Ivory. Just a moment. She passed away this morning. There must be some sort of mistake. She was transferred last night. She was found hanging in her cell early this morning. Suicide. Hello. [Jake sobbing] Good morning George. Good morning. I just got off the phone with my guy from last night. It's been quite a change of events. All things considering, I'm surprised he's still speaking with me. But apparently Jan killed herself last night. They found her this morning hanging from her bed sheets. There was no note, nothing. He also went on to say that a call came in this morning from a guy asking to speak to her. They suspected it was Jake. So they traced the call. Came from Monte Sereno over here. A little small town next to Los Gatos. That was about 15 minutes ago. I was thinking if we left right now he might still be there. Got you now, fucker. Donations are much appreciated. Thank you. Afternoon. Hi. Donations are much appreciated. Sorry, I don't have much on me. You wouldn't happen to be hiring by any chance would you? I'm looking for work. What kind of work are you looking for mister? I'll do anything. Well, why don't you come back tomorrow, my boss will be here. I'm sure he can find you something. And you can pay for those when you come back tomorrow. Thanks. Afternoon gentlemen, what can I do you for? Good afternoon. You didn't see a young man come through here? In his 30's, Asian. Yeah. We don't get too many of those around these parts. Today must be your lucky day. When was he last here? Just a few minutes ago. You just missed him. Helped himself to some fruit and then he took off on foot. I think I saw him go behind the house to eat. He's probably still back there by the garage. If you see him, I want you to hold him where he's at. And call for me. I want the pleasure for myself. Of course George. Say, is he armed? I don't think so. Well let's assume he is. You can never be too careful. I'll take this side and you take the other end. I'm sorry Jan. I'm sorry Harry, Martha, Melanie. Please forgive me. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... [Jake sobbing] Just do it. Come on pussy. Fucking do it. [gun firing] Sid! Sidney! Sidney. [gun firing] [slow paced music] [door clanking] George! Where the hell have you been? The police have been calling me all day! They think that you killed Robert Sulling! What is that for? God damn it George! I need you to stop and listen to me! You won't answer your phone! I just called the police back less than 10 minutes ago! They're gonna be here any minute! George, you're scaring me. I need you to stop what you're doing! Please! God damn it George! [sirens blaring] George please. [George sobbing] This is the Walnut Police Department. Come out the front door [door banging] Don't come in! He has a gun and my daughter's inside! Mom, what the fuck is going on! There's a bunch of cops in the driveway! It's okay. Jut go back to your room. Everything will be okay. Just go back to your room. Please. George, I beg of you, please don't do this! No. No, no, no, no! [phone ringing] I hope you find what it is you're looking for. But you won't find it with us. And you won't find it where you're going either. Never. Some people are just meant to be lonely. George no! [gun firing] No! No! How could you! [gun firing] This is the Walnut Police Department! Come out the front door with your hands up! [slow paced music] I usually don't pick up hitchhikers, you know. But I'm feeling generous today. What's your name? I am Mandy. Hey, don't look so glum mister. Life's beautiful. I'm headed down to Santa Cruz, Is that where you're going? Santa Cruz is fine. Alrighty then. Santa Cruz it is. You ever been to the Boardwalk? All right. The strong silent type huh? Okay, I'll make a deal with you. If you don't want me to talk, I won't say anything else unless you say something first. Deal? [Jake chuckling] What's so funny? I never stopped to think about it until now. What's that? That my entire life is over because my landlord decide to raise my rent by $100. $100. That's what's turned my life into this miserable shitty existence. 100 fucking dollars. Hey, life's not so bad. You're just going through a rough patch. Things will get better. I mean, they always do. No offense miss, but you have no fucking idea what I've been through. Sorry. I guess it's not really my place to say. No, no. It's all right, I'm sorry. You know, you go through life thinking that you know people. But you really don't. Then you think you know yourself but even that ends up being a surprise. That's what life is. A big fucking surprise party. For people who hate surprises. Yeah, it's a crazy world out there. That's for sure. Hey, do you mind if I pull over real quick? I just need to make a quick phone call and I'm finally getting reception. Just don't wanna lose it. It's your car. I appreciate the ride. [slow paced music] One move and I'll slit your fucking throat. Get out of the car. Slowly. [Mandy laughing] Did you actually think we were going down to Santa Cruz asshole? Fucking idiot. You deserve to get robbed. Take your wallet out, slowly. I don't have any cash on me. We take plastic as well. I have nothing! Well then buddy boy, you're gonna die here today. I'm sure this silicon valley nerd has American Express. Stay away from me! I told you, I don't have anything! Bullshit! Everyone has something. Nothing! Damn it! Well what now? Just dig a hole and take care of him. I'm not doing the digging again! Jesus, just make him do it! Jesus Christ! Put the fucking knife down! Put the fucking knife down, put the shovel down! Drop the knife. Now give me your keys. Stop right there and throw the keys to me! I said stop and throw them to me! [gun firing] [Jake breathing heavily] [gun clicking] [Jake grunting] [metal clanking] [male yelling] [metal clanking] [engine turning] [slow gentle music]
