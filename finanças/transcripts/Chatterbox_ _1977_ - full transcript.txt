[Ted] What? I didn't say anything, Ted. I never had any complaints, Penny. [Virginia] We're not interested in your references. [Penny] I think I'm gonna be sick. Well, you don't have to take it out on me, Penny. [grunts] [clinking] [Ted exhales sharply] I must be out of my mind. I don't know what's come over me! [giggling] [Virginia] I'm under you not over you! [giggling]That's right, it's me, your own little chatterbox! Listen, Penny, I'm fed up taking it on the chin. Oh my God! [knocking on door] What are you doing, Penny? What's gotten into you? [Virginia] That's what I'd like to know, I'm not your fallout shelter. I've never heard you talk this way before! [clatter] It's not me, Ted. You have to believe me! [Virginia] She's right, Ted, it's me. Can you handle a little wisecrack? [muffled]I mean, what the fuck... It's that how you feel, I'm leaving. Ted? Wait, Ted! [Virginia] I'm a little chatterbox! [muffled mumbling] I don't know what's wrong with you, Penny. But I'll be damned if you're gonna make me feel inadequate! [Virginia] Inadequate! I'm just trying to help you boogie you turkey! [Ted] We're through, Penny. [door slams] Ted! [Mr. Jo singing] [woman] Good morning, Mr. Jo! I was hoping you could comb me out. [chuckles]I just had my nails done. [indistinct chattering] But Ted, please... I'll never understand how you could said that to me last night. I know men have feelings too. I'm sorry, Penny, but a man with my endowments doesn't have to put up with that kind of abuse. I have a Master's Degree in Business Administration. I play tennis. I earn 25,000 dollars a year, not to mention the fact that I've never had any criticism in the sack. [Virginia scoffs] [Virginia] Let me talk to him. I'll tell him what a loser he is. -What? -[voice chuckles] So far, Thursday, two-thirty is still open. I can give you Lind Ann. OK. All right, I'll be really nice. Why is Mrs. Walker waiting? Penny is running late. [stutters] Penny... again... I... As far as I'm concerned, Penny, there's nothing to explain. [sighs] I think you said it all. [hangs up] What are you doing young lady? For goodness! You want definitive permanent wave? I was just talking to somebody on the phone. -A little upset. -A little upset... So is Mrs. Walker, you kept her waiting 15 minutes downstairs. -Get, get, get. -I'm sorry Mr. Jo. Don't forget Mrs. Hosenfeld coming in at closing time. No, I won't forget. Well you won't forget, you won't forget. I know dammed well she'll forget, the Barracuda! You can't trust any of 'em. I don't know what men see in them any way! -Where's Mrs. Walker? -I don't know, I guess she left. Ruined my day! I don't wanna sound cold-hearted, Penny, but maybe you are better off without Ted. It's not Ted, Linda Ann. It's me. I... I... Oh, Linda Ann! The water is running up my nose. I can't talk here. Well, then let's go some place where it's more private. Just let it dry naturally. I'll be right back! [indistinct chattering] Linda Ann! Rub it down with the towel, dear, it's gonna look terrific. Good. Now, what is it, Penny? [sighs] If you can't tell your best friend, who can you tell? I don't know I f I can ever tell anyone ever! Is it that bad? Then you gotta tell me. I know I gotta tell somebody. I know. I do. What would you say if I told you that my... ...vagina... ...could talk? Your vagina? It says the most horrible things like last night with Ted and just a little while ago when I was on the telephone. It's not saying anything now, is it? Of course not! What do you think, I'm crazy? Penelope, you are the sanest most down to Earth girl that I know. Well at least I used to be, until last night. Maybe it's a split personality. You know, like Joanne Woodward. [sighs] You want me to look? I don't know. What I... Hello? Hello? [knocking on door] -Are you in there, Linda Ann? -[giggling] Old two-ton! Be right out! What are you doing in there? I gotta go. I was doing some research Mrs... Bugatowsky. You are just gonna love what I came up with for you. I am? [indistinct chattering] I don't know what I'm gonna come up with you, Penelope but I will think of something. [clock ticking] [grunt] [doorbell rattles] Oh, hi Mrs. Hosenfeld, Penny is waiting for you upstairs. Goodnight. Hello, Penny? Hello Mrs. Hosenfeld! I'll be right down. [Virginia] Hey, did you see the way she looked at me? Oh my God, is back! [Virginia] I never left. And I think Mrs. House-on-fire is burning for more than just getting her hair done. [mocking laugh] Anything wrong? Oh no, not really. Well I broke up with my boyfriend today, so... If I seem a little upset... I wouldn't waste too much time worrying about your boyfriend, Penelope. A girl like you, won't ever be lonely. I'm not really worried about being lonely. [Virginia] Not with a sweet pussy like you around. -Excuse me, dear? -[stuttering] I've just... said that I won't be lonely, because I have my pussycat around. Oh, well I suppose a pet could be very nice but it can hardly fill the void left by a lover. [Virginia] Hey, can you fill the void? Penelope? I meant to say how would you suggest I feel the void? [Virginia] I'm wide open for suggestions! Penelope! I've never dreamed... Wait, you don't understand, what I meant to say -was... -[Virginia] Come down and meet me for lunch at the Y, chickity! And you didn't even move your lips. I don't think I feel too well, Mrs. Hosenfeld. You are shaking! Don't be afraid. I think I'm gonna be sick. Don't worry, you are tense. It's all this social indoctrination boys with girls, girls with boys. If you want to try a new combination, you feel guilty. I don't think I want to try new combinations. Nonsense! Of course you do. I don't think you'd ever said before. You spoke straight from the heart. [Virginia whoops] Seems better. Yes, but... Oh, no, let's stay with the "yes". Forget the "but". [Virginia] Are you crazy? Oh my God! What a feast! Mrs. Hosenfeld! [Virginia] Hey! Hey! Hey! [Mr. Jo singing] [Penelope screeching] [Mrs. Hosenfeld] Oh dear, don't fight it. Don't strain yourself you'll love it. I'm sorry, it's a private office. I beg your pardon. Wait a minute, it's my private office, what are you doing? I couldn't! No one would blitz! How dare you do something like that in a place where decent people come, and have their hair done? I can't explain this, it's just embarrassing. [mumbling] I don't know what I'm gonna do. You go, get, get, get! I'm gonna tell your mother. Same time next week, dear. I will never understand women. Never! [meditative music] Doctor Pearl? Yes, Ms. Pittman? [sighs] I don't know what to say, doctor so, I'm just gonna come out, and tell you my problem. I have a vagina that can talk. At least I think I do. You've come to the right place, to talk about it. [Virginia] Forget the talk. Let's hit the couch and wrestle with the problem. "Never with a patient" It's against my ethics. There it goes again, that foul mouthed little beast! Ms. Pittman, what are you doing? I'm gonna show, doctor, it's driving me crazy! But Ms. Pittman! [Virginia] What's up, doc? [giggling] I would never have believed it! It's against all the laws of... of medical science! -Then it is true. -You are a wonder! Ms. Pittman... [Virginia] Now let's keep things straight around here, doc. I'm the wonder, she's just tits and ass. Doctor, can you please help me? I've never been so miserable in my whole life. You have no idea the aggravation that this is putting me through.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! We've got a terrific show for you tonight! This evening represents a milestone in the annals of the history of the Hollywood Open House. Everybody says what the... What's the Hollywood Open House? I was gonna speak to you tonight on perversion for beginners. But I see we have an advanced class here. Doctor Pearl, I'm a nervous wreck! I've never thought I would be ever doing anything like this in my entire life! Well you gotta take it moment by moment. But I've never thought it would be getting up in front of the whole country and exposing myself. Well that's show business. You gotta expose yourself I am gonna have a question period. But please for the sake of brevity when you ask a question, please no names or where are you from. We don't care where you are from. [laughs] Now are there any questions? [indistinct chattering] Mean you know it all? We've got a question from the young lady. Do you think there should be sex before a wedding? No, if it delays the ceremony. [laughter] Any other stupid questions? What do you think of the Indianapolis five hundred? They are all innocent! [laughter] Any other stupid questions? Now we have these few hours left. [man] Can you explain Einstein's -theory of relativity? -Yes. [laughter] That was an easy one. Any other question? [laughs] I'm sure you're interested in some of the important points of this thesis. Well, Einstein, proved conclusively that heating causes expansion. And cooling causes contraction. That's why in the summer the days are longer. Because it's harder. Isn't that true, sir, when you get hot doesn't it get bigger? [laughter] [applause] Now this evening we have a very interesting show. Look, Penny, I know how difficult it is to live out with the responsibility of a special talent like yours. [Virginia harmonizing her voice] But you've got to. I'll try, doctor. [Virginia] Come on, come on! Walk faster, my next act in number 3 is starting to melt! Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick. You are not gonna be sick. What do you do? Spend the rest of your life in a beauty parlor with a comb in your hand? When you could be a star? No, I guess not. Of course not. [host]But now the conversation has descend to this level. I think it's a good time to introduce our next guest. Oh, she has a phenomenal talent! A performer who was recently made her debut before de AMA convention. [Dr. Pearl] Look there's no stopping you now. All you have to do is going out there and I guarantee you that that audience is gonna be eating right out of the palm of your hand. You may have come in here feeling like a frightened little girl, but when you leave here everyone in America will know that you are a total woman. [Virginia] Thanks, doc she really needed that.

And I certainly wouldn't go on television and embarrass my mother. I was hoping you wouldn't see me. Wouldn't see you? With all this publicity? You'd think they were sending Henry Kissinger to the moon. [Virginia] I don't know what makes that such a big deal. Oh! -Was that...? -[Virginia] Yeah. And you didn't even kiss me hello. You see, Mrs. Pittman, Virginia has a mind of her own. -Yes, mother, and Dr. Pearl... -Dr. Pearl? You're a doctor? Yes, not just a doctor, a doctor/agent. A doctor/agent? I've never heard such a thing. Yes, well, you see Mrs. Pittman, when Penelope first came to see me, she was in a state of mental shock. [Dr. Pearl] Soon and with my help, however, she was able to adjust to this medical phenomenon which puts me into a very unique position. Not only can I help her as her psychiatrist to adjust and to grow, but I also manage her career. [talking slowly] A multimillion dollar career. A multimillion dollar career? You went to the right doctor/agent. But... Mother, you mean you approve? [Virginia] She's not such a pain in my ass after all. I knew you where a sensible woman from the moment I first saw you. [laughing] Yeah, well... I guess I was just being a little old fashioned, dear. Well... I'm so glad that you are in harmony with me, Mrs. Pittman. Eleanor. -Eleanor? -Mhm. Well, Eleanor, there is something that you can do to cooperate. -Me? -Yes. -What? -The photographers asked if you would pose with Penelope for a family style picture. I wouldn't have to be naked, would I? Only if you want to. Oh! [laughs] I, myself, am not into this new moral revolution, [laughing] No, no! Very nice. [loud chatter] [speaking in foreign language] [Mrs. Pittman laughs] Yes, I am delighted with my daughter's success, gentlemen, yeah. And I am very proud of her. Open your coat dear.

His pants fit like a glove, get it? [Virginia laughs] [indistinct chatter] Isn't this nice, dear? Yes, it's lovely. [Virginia] You know, ma, you've got a lot of style. I like to think so. -Hey, aren't you...? -Yes, yes. Are you ladies ready? [Virginia] You serve a box lunch? [laughing out loud] Yes, I'll have a small filet, rare, and a glass of white wine. And what would you like? I'll have a tuna salad and an ice tea. [Virginia] I'll have a tongue sandwich very lean if you don't mind. [laughing] Little devil. Can't you just cool it. Oh, my God! I just can't tell you how much I admire you, Virginia. I think you put Gloria Steinem to shame! [Virginia] Thanks, I put them all to shame. You sure do. I'm their mother. Oh! Oh, what a pleasure!

Oh, yes, of course, and their mother, Mrs. Pittman. Tell us, Virginia, is there any truth to the rumor that Betty Fergan has challenged you to a debate? The artist, the artist seized by the wanton ways of this poor possessed child! Let the evil be driven from her, cast out this wantonness or spend the days of your life in shame! Oh, repent! [Virginia]Hey, a little respect there folks! [screaming] Repent! Yes, sir, ladies and gentleman, that's Virginia for you, always the center of attention. Can I have your autograph, Virginia? -[Virginia] Woo, woo! -[Penelope] She can't write, I have the hands! The way I see it, Penelope and Virginia are just going through a little sibling rivalry. [tranquil music] Hello, Ted? This is Penny. [birds chirping] Are you sure you wouldn't rather sit by the water, Ted? There's not enough grass. We'd get dirty. I made your favorite, cream cheese and jelly. Thank you for remembering. Well you mean a lot to me, Ted. Thank you, Penny. What I really want to know is... How does Virginia feel about me. She's doing alright so far, isn't she? Yes, but... How does she feel about me? Oh, go ahead, Virginia, tell Ted how you feel about him. [Virginia] I think you are the greatest guy that ever lived. She doesn't sound to good, Penny. Oh, it's laryngitis. She strained her vocal cords. -[birds chirping] -[water flowing] Ted, the reason she said those things... Well she... She felt hostile and she wasn't being understood. I suppose having a career makes her feel more secure. Oh, Ted, I love you! I love you too, Penny! And I'm gonna give you the greatest loving of your life. [Penelope moans] [Virginia] Hold it, hold it! -Virginia! -I'm stranded down here, I'm singing in the rain, what is this? I thought it was a little too coincidental that she changed her mind about me so quickly! [Virginia] I'm willing to give you a chance, -butterfingers. -Butterfingers? I'm not a tight ass, I know what's there. [Ted] Look, Penelope? I don't have to stay here being insulted by that bitch! Ted, look, what am I supposed to do? I didn't tell her to say any of those things at all. I don't even care what kind of lover you are. Great! You don't even care what kind of lover I am! I'm that good, am I? -[Penny grunts] -[tense music] [Ted slams door] [Penelope cries] [Virginia] Shit, is he sensitive. He happens to be a human being, Virginia, and that's how they act. You... You can't even keep a bargain! Penny, look, if that guy would give me half a chance, we could make beautiful music together. [phone rings] Hello, Ted? Yes, Dr. Pearl, I'm listening. [sniveling] And I've got you set for six television appearances. Starting tonight. [sighs] No, no, no, of course... Of course I'm excited. It's just my personal life I'm worried about. [theme music] Oh, thank you, thank you very much. Good evening, ladies and gentleman. We've a very special show for you tonight to mark the premiere television frankest most adult new program, "The Mating Game", where our bachelors and bachelorettes pull no punches in speaking what is on their minds and yours. Our mystery guests are waiting in the wrings. So without further ado, let's meet our three hopeful bachelors. [theme music] [host] Bachelor number one: Dick Taylor! [applause] Number two: Brute Serigliano! [applause] And Virgil Walton! And here is our lovely guest star, America's sweetheart, Penelope Pittman! [applause] And your favorite and mine, Virginia! [applause] Oh, isn't she lovely, folks? And you'll begin the questioning with... Bachelor number one. [audience laughs] Bachelor number one, what would you say is more important to you about a woman? Her body or her mind? Her mind. Definitively her mind, she's... got to be into the kinds of things that I'm into. [Virginia] My hobby number one is men all sizes, all shapes, you get my drift? Oh, well, yes. If you wanna be graphic about it. Bachelor number three, would you say you are well educated? Well, I'm a straight A student, yes. [Virginia] Well I choose bachelor number three and we'll go to Bermuda or my room, whichever's closer. Bachelor number two, would you call yourself a gentleman? I'd call myself a hot property. [Virginia] If he's big enough to back that up, I'll take him sight unseen. -You're big enough to find out? -[Virginia] Woo! I choose number two. The number two is so cooperative, isn't he? Bachelor number one, would you consider yourself romantic? Yes, and.. Very old fashioned. [Virginia] Boy, I'm one-one, I'll break him down. I don't know which one I choose. [trumpets] I'm sorry, time's up. So, Penelope, if you and Virginia would like to compare notes to see which young man rates best with America's special... [Virginia] I'll take the announcer. Penelope will probably go for bachelor number one and Virginia will go for number two. -You think so? -Sure. Bachelor number one. [Virginia] And two and three. [big band music] [laughing] Oh! They agreed! They finally agreed, isn't that wonderful? My therapy is finally working. Aren't they a cute couple? [Virginia] A cute trio. Lovely, lovely, and now all that's left is for you to have a really exciting night at the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel compliments of The Mating Game. [disco music] [background chatter] Penny? [crowd whispering] It's Virginia! I love this place. I come here a lot. It sort of helps me unwind. What'll you have? Ah... Something light. Two double gin martinis straight up with an olive. [Linda] Yoo-hoo, Penelope, yoo-hoo! Oh, excuse me. Hi! They're playing your song! I just love it. I saw you on television, you were fabulous. Thank you! Did things ever work out with Ted? No, but I have a new man in my life over there. [Linda] He's a dream! Is it true you're gonna be doing a movie? Yeah, that's what they want, no? [laughing] Boy, that would really finish off Mr. Jo! I'm gonna go over and... -See you? -Okay, Ba-bye! That's Penelope Pittman. I knew her when. You're having a good time? I think so. Oh, sure you are. Come on, loosen up a little. We're just beginning.

I'm sorry, Dick, but in spite of all this fame, Virginia feels she's been disappointed a lot lately. Well... -Here's a little something... -[bottle pops] ...to chase the blues away. [romantic music] Just for you. How romantic. To love. [clink] Oh, Dick, I'm so glad I ended up with you. -Me too. -[Virginia] Me three. [Virginia] Oh, boy, this is like watching a B movie.

I'll be waiting for you in my bedroom. [music ends] [Virginia] Geez, would you look at this! I bet this guy owns real state on fantasy land. [Virginia] Oh! I hope this guy makes love better than he can spell. That is really tacky. My, isn't Dick romantic? [Virginia] Sure he's romantic. Let's just hope he lives up to his advertising. [romantic music] [Virginia] Come on, come on, what are you going so slow for? This is it, I'm finally gonna get it. [Virginia] Uh! I feel like we're gonna be sacrificed. [Virginia] Mmm! Feels good to be lying down, I've been on your feet all day. [trumpets sound] [Dick] Tonight, I am your prince. Valiant! [Virginia laughing]Oh, Christ! I hope you brought a can opener! Penelope... Penelope... No one has ever loved you as I will, Penelope. [Virginia laughing] No offense, Dick, but this is like making it with a Buick! [kissing] ♪ I've never ♪ felt anything quite like... ♪ ♪ This. [door opens] [heroic music] For the lady. -Dick, you shouldn't have. -Oh, yes I should. No, wait. Why? Goodbye? [Dick] I told you not to read it now. Goodbye? Why does my fortune cookie say goodbye? Because I can't see you again. That's why. But you were my knight in shining armor! All my fortune cookies say goodbye. That's the way it is with me. [Virginia] How about Tuesdays and Thursdays? No. I don't understand. I saw, I conquered... -and I came. -[Virginia] You sure did. You can never be my princess again. [knocking on door] Excuse me, but do you have one of this that fits? Not now, wait outside! Oh, well, I see what you mean. [Virginia] Believe me, Dick. It was worth it anyway. Virginia, you don't understand anything. -[door closes] -How was it? Great if you don't mind being queen for a day. [lively music] [gong] [indistinct chatter] Virginia! Sign here! Can I have your autograph? [yelling] No pictures, no pictures, just autographs. [overlapping yelling] Oh, children, look, I'm their mother. Okay, that's it, that's it. We have to be on stage, please, come honey, let's go. Uh, thanks very much, thank you. [Mrs. Pittman] You want my autograph? I feel they're making a statement with this film. What kind of a statement, John? Well, it's... J-O-N. I wanna say something about the alienation. About how nobody gets any satisfaction anymore. Is that why you gave up hairdressing? [snickers] Yeah, that's why. There are a lot of ex-hairdressers connected with this picture, aren't there? -I heard that Penelope Pittman, -Hold it, hold it, miss. What Penelope Pittman was, that's not important. Is what she's gonna become after I make this film. [snaps fingers] Understand? That's the only thing that's important. What she's gonna become-- [rattling] Hold it, hold it, my hair! God dammit! [knocks on door] Ready to go out, Penelope? How does my little girl feel? I'm fine, mom. And how are you down there? [Virginia] I'm horny, ma, what the hell do you think? Two minutes, Ms. Pittman, Two minutes, Virginia. Oh, darling, do you know what Dr. Pearl has done for you? No, what? He has just accepted your contract for 5 pictures! -[Virginia]Five pictures? -[Dr. Pearl] All firm! -Five pictures? -Yes! What do you think of that? Oh, they are so impressed with my girls. They're ready to sign you for life! [Virginia] It sounds great but I'd also like to direct. Well, Penelope, I'll see you on the set. And Virginia... Break a leg! [Virginia] Thanks, doc, break your ass. Oh, isn't he a wonderful man? Oh, darling. I want you to know that I fully approve of your new career. I feel as long as you're in Dr. Pearl's hands, everything will be alright. [Virginia] Thanks, ma. Incidentally, Dr. Pearl thinks that I might be responsible for you feeling guilt about sex. I hope you won't hold it against me, dear. I brought you up the only way I knew. Mother, don't worry about it. Right. Oh, look, darling, a little later Dr. Pearl and I have some very important news for you. I think you'll be very happy about it. Now, hurry up and get dressed. We'll be out there rooting for you. Won't we, Chrissie? Come on, Ba-bye! [Virginia] Gee, isn't it great how mom adjusted to show biz? I want people to know that this is more than just a first film to star a real cunt. Oh, people will know that. I'm sure they will. This is a social document. [inaudible] Alright, stand by! Stand by, stand by! Are we lit for sound? Yes, sir. Oh, good.

[Virginia] You let me out of this car, you are ruining my career. [overlapping yelling] [waves crashing] I think I'm gonna jump. [Virginia]Jump? You've got to be kidding. I'm sorry, Virginia, I just can't stand it anymore. I know you've done your best. Look, Virginia, I want you to know, it's not your fault. I know you're only a part of me. [Virginia] Oh, look, maybe it was my fault, I... I guess I should've been more understanding. Do me a favor, will you, kid? When you jump, keep your legs crossed.
