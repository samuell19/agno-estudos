‪There's a strange noise, no?‬ ‪No, no, look ahead! Look ahead!‬ &lrm;The story begins like this. ‪Think of a positive image.‬ &lrm;Thousands of meters in the air... &lrm;over Greenland. ‪The pilot...‬ &lrm;This is Thomas, my best friend. ‪...looks a bit like Magnum.‬ &lrm;Without him I'd still be in Paris, &lrm;having a quiet life... ‪Yeah, kind of.‬ &lrm;...entangled in my stories, &lrm;ensconced in my sad existence &lrm;between Place Gambetta &lrm;and Boulevard de Ménilmontant. ‪Thomas, the landscape is amazing.‬ &lrm;My name is also Thomas, &lrm;and at this moment, I must admit &lrm;I'm wondering what I'm doing here. ‪THE JOURNEY TO GREENLAND‬ &lrm;In truth, I know very well why I'm here. &lrm;I'm here partly because of this guy. &lrm;This guy is my father, &lrm;and for years he's been &lrm;inviting me to Kullorsuaq, &lrm;a village at the end of the world &lrm;I've heard about since childhood, &lrm;and where he chose to live 20 years ago. ‪You remember Thomas?‬ ‪-I didn't recognize you.‬ ‪-Hello.‬ ‪So...‬ ‪-This is my son, Thomas.‬ ‪-Hello.‬ ‪And his friend, Thomas too.‬ &lrm;And that's Ole and Adam. &lrm;Two years ago, &lrm;Ole and Adam stayed with us in Paris. &lrm;It was the first time &lrm;they'd left their village. &lrm;My father had a hunting accident &lrm;and couldn't accompany them. ‪Know any French singers?‬ &lrm;So we ended up entertaining his friends. ‪You know Edith Piaf?‬ &lrm;It was quite difficult at first. &lrm;We took them to a forest. &lrm;Then the sea, where they had &lrm;their first-ever swim. ‪Goodbye.‬ ‪Goodbye, Ole!‬ &lrm;At the end of their stay, &lrm;we promised to come to Kullorsuaq... &lrm;not really believing we would. ‪Welcome to my home!‬ ‪So, that's the kitchen.‬ ‪That's the living room.‬ ‪Well, I'll let you settle in.‬ ‪See you later.‬ ‪-Which one do you want?‬ ‪-I don't know. This one.‬ ‪Your father's really nice.‬ ‪But you seem very remote.‬ ‪Well, it's just that I'm a little...‬ ‪What?‬ ‪A little upset.‬ ‪He's aged, it was a shock.‬ ‪-When did you last meet?‬ ‪-Three and a half years ago.‬ ‪I mean, we Skype for birthdays but...‬ ‪on Skype, he looked the same.‬ ‪Maybe he thinks you've changed, too.‬ ‪I haven't changed that much‬ ‪in three and a half years!‬ ‪Yeah.‬ ‪"Yeah" what?‬ ‪You don't take care of yourself.‬ ‪-Why do you say that?‬ ‪-You never do sports!‬ ‪Well, do you?‬ ‪Know what? Maybe here‬ ‪I can get back in shape.‬ ‪Yes?‬ ‪Everything OK? I forgot to tell you,‬ ‪tonight there's a party in your honour‬ ‪at the local hall. There'll be nibbles.‬ ‪See you soon.‬ ‪She smiled at me.‬ ‪Beautiful, isn't she?‬ ‪-Not bad.‬ ‪-Not bad? She's Miss Kullorsuaq!‬ ‪Right...‬ ‪Or even Miss Greenland!‬ ‪No, she's really beautiful!‬ ‪Iva! And me?‬ ‪-Thomas.‬ ‪-Thomas. And him?‬ ‪I'm getting hungry. Thomas!‬ ‪Thomas! And Thomas!‬ ‪-Iva!‬ ‪-Iva!‬ ‪-What is it?‬ ‪-Seal liver.‬ ‪Oh, I see.‬ ‪Here's a knife.‬ ‪With some fat.‬ ‪-A tiny bit.‬ ‪-A little bit, yeah.‬ ‪-Whoa, it's all flabby!‬ ‪-I think that's the fat.‬ ‪It's good!‬ ‪It's OK. Not so bad, actually.‬ ‪-And you?‬ ‪-Me?‬ ‪No, I'm fine.‬ ‪I'll let you eat.‬ ‪-Thank you.‬ ‪-Enjoy.‬ ‪Isn't it weird that we don't have a drink?‬ ‪-Here's my father.‬ ‪-Nathan!‬ ‪Is there anything to drink‬ ‪to wash down the seal?‬ ‪-There's no alcohol in the village.‬ ‪-What?‬ ‪They banned it. The locals decided‬ ‪it was causing too much trouble.‬ ‪The food's good, isn't it? Enjoy!‬ ‪We'll never hold out‬ ‪without alcohol. It's impossible.‬ ‪What did he say?‬ ‪He said he had a still‬ ‪hidden at home. He's smart.‬ ‪I guessed as much.‬ ‪I'm relieved,‬ ‪I was having an anxiety attack.‬ ‪-Have some, it'll do you good.‬ ‪-No, thanks.‬ ‪It's very good.‬ &lrm;We're told that's how life is &lrm;And that we can't change it ‪Thomas...‬ ‪Come on!‬ ‪What do I have to do?‬ ‪-He pulls.‬ ‪-He pulls?‬ ‪It's quite a basic game.‬ ‪Go, Thomas!‬ ‪-I'll kill you! You'll see.‬ ‪-No, I'm a Greenlander!‬ ‪Windsurfing!‬ ‪It's like windsurfing.‬ &lrm;Last year will not return &lrm;Let's all join hands &lrm;And give thanks ‪I'm not sure he chose the right guy.‬ ‪-Use your strength, OK?‬ ‪-Yes, I'll pull.‬ ‪You're dead!‬ ‪-Hi, Dad.‬ ‪-Sleep well?‬ ‪Not bad.‬ ‪It's really quiet.‬ ‪I made coffee.‬ ‪The cups are there, behind you.‬ ‪Is your friend still asleep?‬ ‪Thomas can easily‬ ‪sleep round the clock.‬ ‪Will you help me‬ ‪fill the containers?‬ ‪Fill the containers?‬ ‪You see, we have no choice.‬ ‪There's no running water‬ ‪or mains drainage.‬ ‪You saw the toilet.‬ ‪Oh, yes, by the way,‬ ‪how do you...‬ ‪Mr Aku comes to each house‬ ‪once a week to empty the waste.‬ ‪He's also known as Mr Crap.‬ ‪Strange job, eh?‬ ‪I'm glad you came...‬ ‪so you can see what it's like here.‬ ‪I'm glad I came, too.‬ ‪-And how is your mother?‬ ‪-Oh, same as usual.‬ ‪She doesn't change. Same as ever.‬ ‪-Is she still with her psychiatrist?‬ ‪-Yes, she is.‬ ‪As soon as he opens his mouth,‬ ‪you just want to leave.‬ ‪He's the type‬ ‪who has an opinion on everything‬ ‪and can't stand‬ ‪anyone disagreeing.‬ ‪Whenever I go home, he asks me‬ ‪to help him move furniture‬ ‪or repair something.‬ ‪And he makes you feel lazy,‬ ‪but without actually saying it.‬ ‪I shouldn't criticize.‬ ‪They seem to get along, so...‬ ‪Your mother was always good‬ ‪at attracting strange guys!‬ ‪Are you and Thomas together?‬ ‪Together?‬ ‪-Oh, no, not at all!‬ ‪-Only I thought...‬ ‪Got a girlfriend? Or a boyfriend?‬ ‪Yes, I have a girlfriend.‬ ‪Well, more or less.‬ ‪At the moment we're apart, but...‬ ‪we may get back together, it depends.‬ ‪We already broke up‬ ‪and made up again, so it's...‬ ‪That sounds complicated.‬ ‪Yeah, it's not simple.‬ ‪Hello, Nathan, hello, Thomas!‬ ‪Hello, Adam!‬ ‪Your son's grown up, hasn't he?‬ ‪Yes, time flies.‬ ‪Thomas is the same age as me, right?‬ ‪Yes,‬ ‪but you have three children.‬ ‪-He can take one if he wants!‬ ‪-What's he saying?‬ ‪He'll give you one of his children,‬ ‪so I can finally be a grandfather!‬ ‪No, it's fine!‬ ‪Nathan would be a great grandfather!‬ ‪He can take that one!‬ ‪It was a good idea to go jogging, eh?‬ ‪Yeah.‬ ‪It's a change from Buttes Chaumont park.‬ ‪I never really ran there.‬ ‪Too middle-class bohemian.‬ ‪You would say that.‬ ‪If someone told me that one day‬ ‪I'd be running on an ice floe...‬ ‪What would you have said?‬ ‪I wouldn't have believed it.‬ ‪It's more likely for you,‬ ‪your father lives here.‬ ‪My father never took me beyond Dieppe.‬ ‪You had a horrible childhood.‬ ‪Yeah, I wasn't a happy child.‬ ‪Are you serious when you say that?‬ ‪I never joke about childhood, Thomas.‬ ‪I've known you for ten years,‬ ‪and I never know‬ ‪whether you're serious or joking.‬ ‪You've never said‬ ‪what made your father settle here.‬ ‪It started with a trip‬ ‪with Robert,‬ ‪a guy I liked a lot‬ ‪who lived near us in Montreuil.‬ ‪He was an explorer,‬ ‪a bit like Jean Rouch,‬ ‪but funnier, you know?‬ ‪-Wasn't Jean Rouch funny?‬ ‪-I don't know.‬ ‪I'm just surmising.‬ ‪Maybe he was.‬ ‪Anyway, he made a living‬ ‪reporting for TV around the world,‬ ‪and that fascinated my father.‬ ‪-Did Robert die?‬ ‪-Yeah.‬ ‪In a bloody stupid way.‬ ‪He fell from a ladder‬ ‪changing a light bulb.‬ ‪Never mention light bulbs to my father.‬ ‪This was when my parents were fighting.‬ ‪My father decided to go with him‬ ‪for a change of air.‬ ‪Robert had never been here,‬ ‪they were clueless.‬ ‪They ran out of food.‬ ‪Luckily they met Ole,‬ ‪who was hunting in the area,‬ ‪and he brought them to the village.‬ ‪That's how they discovered it.‬ ‪Then my father came back once, twice.‬ ‪Then when he split with my mother‬ ‪and lost his job a year later,‬ ‪he decided to move here.‬ ‪I think there was a chick too,‬ ‪but I never really knew.‬ ‪And you never asked?‬ ‪No. Shall we go?‬ ‪-Aappalaat.‬ ‪-Thomas.‬ ‪-Nuka Peter.‬ ‪-Thomas.‬ ‪-Thomas.‬ ‪-Aappalaat.‬ ‪-Thomas.‬ ‪-Nuka Peter.‬ ‪Want to dance?‬ ‪No, no, thank you.‬ ‪And you? You want to?‬ ‪Go ahead!‬ ‪Beatbox.‬ &lrm;Thomas and I met in a drama class. &lrm;We were both trying to become actors. &lrm;But we lacked the right contacts &lrm;and guidance. ‪You, what's your name again?‬ ‪-Thomas.‬ ‪-Thomas, stand up‬ ‪and come over here.‬ ‪And...‬ ‪you? Hey, you!‬ ‪-What's your name?‬ ‪-Me?‬ ‪My name's Thomas.‬ ‪Well, Thomas and Thomas. Come up.‬ ‪OK, today you're going to improvise.‬ ‪You're brothers, and you're both‬ ‪in love with the same girl.‬ ‪You saw them kissing‬ ‪at school this afternoon.‬ ‪-We're at high school?‬ ‪-Yes, you're in 12th grade.‬ ‪Er... Both of us?‬ ‪Yeah.‬ ‪So one of us repeated a year?‬ ‪Yes, if you want. Let's say it's you.‬ ‪-Can you go out, Thomas?‬ ‪-Me?‬ ‪Yes, you!‬ ‪Go out and come back in,‬ ‪as if back from school.‬ ‪-Your brother's in the kitchen.‬ ‪-What am I doing?‬ ‪I don't know. Eating Nutella!‬ ‪-OK, great.‬ ‪-OK? Off we go!‬ ‪-Hey, hi, Thomas!‬ ‪-Hi.‬ ‪Sorry, but can I change my name?‬ ‪Only two brothers with the same name...‬ ‪Yes, it's true, our parents‬ ‪wouldn't have called us both...‬ ‪-Or are we half-brothers?‬ ‪-Whatever. Call yourself Patrick.‬ ‪-And I keep Thomas?‬ ‪-Yes.‬ ‪-OK.‬ ‪-Here we go!‬ ‪Hey, Patrick! Hi, Patrick! You OK?‬ ‪Uh... hi.‬ ‪-You look weird.‬ ‪-Had a good day?‬ ‪Yeah, not bad. Why do you ask?‬ ‪No reason.‬ ‪You OK? Want some Nutella?‬ ‪No, I'm not hungry.‬ ‪How was your day?‬ ‪Normal.‬ ‪-That's good.‬ ‪-Get a move on!‬ ‪Tell him you saw him‬ ‪kissing the girl you like.‬ ‪Yes, but it's not easy to say.‬ ‪It's intimate stuff,‬ ‪you don't just blurt it out.‬ ‪-Especially to your brother!‬ ‪-Exactly.‬ ‪Do you have brothers and sisters?‬ ‪None of your business.‬ ‪I'm sure you're an only child.‬ ‪-Why do you say that?‬ ‪-Because if you had siblings,‬ ‪you'd understand the situation‬ ‪and what we feel right now.‬ ‪It's true that if I had a brother,‬ ‪I'd never talk to him‬ ‪about affairs of the heart.‬ ‪You must keep things private,‬ ‪especially within your family.‬ ‪-Exactly!‬ ‪-OK, look.‬ ‪If that's how you feel,‬ ‪forget trying to become actors!‬ ‪Go back to your places.‬ ‪What do you mean?‬ ‪-We're not improvising?‬ ‪-No, you're not. Go and sit down.‬ ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪We're leaving.‬ ‪We'll keep our feelings‬ ‪to ourselves elsewhere.‬ ‪Right, who's next?‬ ‪A CLUB IS MORE THAN JUST SPORTS‬ ‪I wanted to ask you,‬ ‪the pretty girl who was there‬ ‪with her friends at the party,‬ ‪the brunette‬ ‪with a nice smile, what's her name?‬ ‪You mean Nukannguaq.‬ ‪Nur... Nur-kan-guap.‬ ‪Yeah...‬ ‪-Is she with someone?‬ ‪-Why, you interested?‬ ‪No, Thomas is.‬ ‪It's just that I'm in a period‬ ‪that's very conducive to falling in love.‬ ‪It's very powerful.‬ ‪So if there are opportunities...‬ ‪I'm not sure she's‬ ‪in a situation as conducive as yours.‬ ‪She's had a difficult time lately.‬ ‪What happened?‬ ‪Her little brother died...‬ &lrm;My father told us &lrm;Nukannguaq's little brother &lrm;had committed suicide a few months before, &lrm;and that it was in no way &lrm;an isolated case. ‪It's the first generation‬ ‪to use the Internet, Facebook.‬ ‪They see all these things‬ ‪they'll never experience.‬ ‪It's as if for the first time‬ ‪they were told‬ ‪that in their village, life is limited.‬ ‪Here,‬ ‪you go to school until you're 15, then‬ ‪either you leave for the capital,‬ ‪which is a hard decision,‬ ‪or you become a hunter,‬ ‪and do what your parents did.‬ ‪Most resign themselves,‬ ‪but her little brother‬ ‪took a more radical decision.‬ &lrm;Aided by the alcohol, &lrm;the tone of the evening changed. &lrm;We left the melancholic lands &lrm;where our talk of Nukannguaq's &lrm;little brother had led us &lrm;for more familiar territory. &lrm;Thomas gave us, for the umpteenth time &lrm;since I've known him, &lrm;an imitation of Daniel Auteuil in the part &lrm;of Ugolin. ‪The girl from the spring,‬ ‪I love her, the carnation girl.‬ ‪I'll give you anything.‬ ‪I... I saw you naked,‬ ‪I saw you naked in the river.‬ ‪You were magnificent.‬ ‪The scene I love is the one‬ ‪with Anconina, you know,‬ ‪-where he's very surprised.‬ ‪-Which one?‬ ‪-He's like that.‬ ‪-What's that?‬ ‪It's in &lrm;Itinerary of a Spoiled Child&lrm;.‬ ‪And what is it, what does he do?‬ ‪Belmondo says, "You often seem surprised."‬ ‪"You often seem surprised," he says.‬ ‪And Anconina says, "Really?"‬ ‪-My parents pushed me into acting.‬ ‪-Really?‬ ‪Oh, yeah.‬ ‪-They didn't really push you...‬ ‪-They did.‬ ‪They didn't push you.‬ ‪They were happy you were doing something.‬ ‪I had a classmate‬ ‪whose parents were actors,‬ ‪and they forced him to act.‬ ‪What interested him was insurance.‬ ‪-Really?‬ ‪-It was awful.‬ ‪He had to form a group‬ ‪of amateur insurers in a garage‬ ‪to satisfy his passion,‬ ‪because everyone wanted him to act,‬ ‪and he couldn't stand it.‬ ‪It wasn't his thing.‬ ‪No, don't get that, it looks disgusting!‬ ‪What do you want?‬ ‪You want to get this thing?‬ ‪-I don't even know what it is.‬ ‪-Get some and we'll see!‬ ‪Hello.‬ ‪-You OK?‬ ‪-Yes, and you?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪There's music at the Klubi later.‬ ‪You want to come?‬ ‪We'd love to, thank you!‬ ‪Great!‬ ‪-Goodbye!‬ ‪-Goodbye!‬ ‪Goodbye!‬ ‪You speak Inuit?‬ ‪I learned a few words‬ ‪from a book, that's all.‬ ‪What did he say?‬ ‪He invited us to a place‬ ‪where they make music.‬ ‪Crowded, isn't it?‬ ‪It's really crowded. No? It's really...‬ ‪What did you buy?‬ ‪What, uh...‬ ‪What did you buy?‬ ‪It's nice, I like your haircut,‬ ‪it's funny.‬ ‪Good day.‬ ‪I was ridiculous.‬ ‪No.‬ ‪She's pretty, huh?‬ ‪Pretty girls who've suffered‬ ‪are what upset me most.‬ ‪I need to learn Inuit, and fast.‬ &lrm;I need you to know &lrm;That I want to love you &lrm;That doesn't mean &lrm;I want to possess you &lrm;I'm still in love with you &lrm;And I want to always be &lrm;At your side &lrm;Maybe you already forgot me &lrm;And you met someone else &lrm;My dear love &lrm;Maybe I already lost you &lrm;My land, when I look at you &lrm;I am amazed &lrm;By your beauty &lrm;Sometimes &lrm;Alone on the mountain &lrm;I find myself dreaming &lrm;I want to find someone &lrm;To share this land &lrm;For future days ‪Yeah!‬ ‪-I want to try something.‬ ‪-Go ahead!‬ ‪What is it?‬ &lrm;Welcome to the workforce &lrm;The world of sharks &lrm;The state is worse &lrm;Than a gang of robbers &lrm;There's nothing you can do &lrm;Accept it or go to war &lrm;My misspent youth &lrm;Showed me the way &lrm;Now I see we're being screwed &lrm;I take the rough with the smooth &lrm;But never give in &lrm;The consumer society &lrm;Is boys' education &lrm;Assassin Production &lrm;Rises up and says no &lrm;I point the finger at the government &lrm;I will never be a slave &lrm;To your society! ‪You want to see my father?‬ ‪See Nathan?‬ ‪He must have gone to get water.‬ ‪Fill the containers.‬ ‪Get some water!‬ ‪-Who's he?‬ ‪-No idea.‬ ‪-Where's your father?‬ ‪-At the stand pipe, I think.‬ ‪-Sit down, I'll make some coffee.‬ ‪-Really?‬ ‪Hunting.‬ ‪He's been a long time.‬ ‪It's quite an embarrassing moment.‬ ‪He doesn't look very embarrassed.‬ ‪Oh, Martika! When did you get back?‬ ‪I came back yesterday. I killed a bear.‬ ‪I left at dawn.‬ ‪-You must come with me next time.‬ ‪-That's incredible!‬ ‪Martika is the village's best hunter.‬ ‪He came back last night‬ ‪with his seventh bear‬ ‪since the start of the year.‬ ‪He wants me to go with him next time.‬ ‪I will come.‬ ‪Champion!‬ ‪Seven...‬ ‪Why are they in such a hurry?‬ ‪The French are weird sometimes.‬ ‪I'll make a hole here.‬ ‪We were lucky with the weather!‬ ‪-A fish.‬ ‪-Fish?‬ ‪-Fish?‬ ‪-Fish!‬ ‪-Yeah!‬ ‪-Wow, great!‬ ‪Another one! Good things come in threes!‬ ‪-Looks like a sardine.‬ ‪-You look like his son.‬ ‪You're his favourite!‬ ‪-Fisherman.‬ ‪-Fisherman.‬ ‪Fisherman.‬ ‪-Eh, Tommy?‬ ‪-Thomas is gifted.‬ ‪It's funny, we caught two at once‬ ‪and then nothing.‬ ‪Thomas the great fisherman‬ ‪and Thomas the little fisherman.‬ ‪-They must be sleeping.‬ ‪-They're sleeping!‬ ‪Too bad for us.‬ ‪I was born in Qaarusulik.‬ ‪While I was still a little boy,‬ ‪my mother died.‬ ‪I was very small,‬ ‪and this couple adopted me and raised me.‬ ‪In 1956, we moved to Kullorsuaq.‬ ‪-Can you record it?‬ ‪-I started school early.‬ ‪-Our house looked like this.‬ ‪-Yes.‬ ‪-A Greenlandic home.‬ ‪-OK.‬ ‪Here inside, an old stove and some wood.‬ ‪These are the houses of my childhood.‬ ‪At the time, there were only 20 houses.‬ ‪-He built the house with his hands.‬ ‪-I think so.‬ ‪These are photos of me as a child‬ ‪when I was at school.‬ ‪And this...‬ ‪is my youngest son.‬ ‪My son.‬ ‪And who's that?‬ ‪-The woman with the pipe?‬ ‪-Yes, that's her pipe.‬ ‪-Auntie?‬ ‪-At the time, older women smoked.‬ ‪-There's a family resemblance.‬ ‪-This is me,‬ ‪at my daughter's confirmation.‬ ‪This is my wife,‬ ‪and there, my grandchildren.‬ ‪I think he wants to tell us‬ ‪the entire history of the village.‬ ‪At the time, there were no motor boats,‬ ‪only kayaks.‬ ‪There was no shop in Qaarusulik,‬ ‪only Kullorsuaq, so people‬ ‪went kayaking to do their shopping.‬ ‪-OK.‬ ‪-They row.‬ ‪And this is Kullorsuaq.‬ ‪It's beautiful.‬ ‪Sometimes,‬ ‪there are narwhal here.‬ ‪And that's a walrus we caught.‬ ‪-It's young, it's not big.‬ ‪-Oh, yeah, it's a bear!‬ ‪It's a bear that was pregnant,‬ ‪and gave birth to a female cub.‬ ‪-It's a bear...‬ ‪-No, that's a whale.‬ ‪Bear?‬ ‪-Walrus.‬ ‪-Ah, yes.‬ ‪It's not over yet.‬ ‪I think he's got all his photos out.‬ ‪-It's nice of him, though.‬ ‪-Yeah, it's very nice.‬ &lrm;The sky above the roof &lrm;So blue, so calm &lrm;A tree over the roof rocks its palm &lrm;My God, my God, &lrm;Life is simple and quiet &lrm;This quiet rumour here &lrm;Comes from the city &lrm;What did you do, &lrm;O thou who art here &lrm;To cry so incessantly? &lrm;Say, what did you do &lrm;Thou who art here &lrm;With your youth? ‪-Ole, that's for your 50th birthday.‬ ‪-A little laborious, but...‬ ‪My turn now.‬ &lrm;Despite the wide eyes &lrm;Of nothingness &lrm;The better to eat you, child &lrm;And the silence and the noise &lrm;We must live &lrm;And though blind &lrm;On a black background &lrm;Between the infinite chasms &lrm;Billions of stars laughing &lrm;We must live &lrm;Though we may not be beautiful &lrm;And are no longer 16 years old &lrm;And hope is a blank check &lrm;We must live &lrm;Despite the heart &lrm;That loses its way &lrm;The wind of love still blows &lrm;And which sometimes &lrm;Still intoxicates us &lrm;We must live &lrm;Even though &lrm;In the heaven of our love... ‪I've lost it. I'm too old.‬ ‪Well done!‬ ‪In France, we do this to stay fit!‬ ‪-Are you OK?‬ ‪-Must we go on?‬ ‪I'm already tired,‬ ‪and these boots are too heavy.‬ ‪Yes, I know.‬ ‪We could say we have work to do.‬ ‪They seem to be loving it.‬ ‪Go in defence, play defence!‬ ‪I'm attacking.‬ ‪Go! Come on!‬ ‪Come on! Get stuck in!‬ ‪-Thomas, go in defence!‬ ‪-I am!‬ &lrm;Each day that passed in Kullorsuaq &lrm;distanced us from our lives in Paris. ‪I'll run with you‬ ‪and we'll do a one-two. No?‬ &lrm;From what had led us to leave the city... &lrm;to flee. &lrm;One must call a spade a spade, &lrm;and an escape... &lrm;uh... an escape. ‪Go, Daniel!‬ ‪Mélanie!‬ ‪Start it, quick!‬ ‪Daniel!‬ ‪Quick!‬ ‪Cut!‬ ‪Shit!‬ ‪I don't believe it, Thomas!‬ ‪You can't even start the fucking car!‬ ‪-It's not my fault, it stalls.‬ ‪-It stalls?‬ ‪You left it in first again.‬ ‪Back to your places, everyone.‬ ‪Yeah, I left it in first.‬ ‪I'm sorry.‬ ‪Yeah, right.‬ ‪You would behold with regret‬ ‪walking in your wake‬ ‪an unworthy emperor‬ ‪without empire, without court,‬ ‪vile spectacle of human love's weaknesses.‬ ‪Lord, it is time to leave.‬ ‪Lord, it is time to leave.‬ ‪There is nothing of which I am incapable.‬ ‪You are now responsible for my life.‬ ‪Think well upon it, madam.‬ ‪It was magical tonight.‬ ‪Wasn't it?‬ &lrm;Memories weren't the only things fading. &lrm;In Kullorsuaq, the nights &lrm;were all but forgotten. ‪-This is Greenland.‬ ‪-What's that?‬ ‪The Earth.‬ ‪It's like that, I think.‬ ‪-And...‬ ‪-What's your finger?‬ ‪-It's the Moon... The Sun.‬ ‪-Ah the Sun, yeah.‬ ‪How does it work?‬ ‪The Sun orbits the Earth.‬ ‪No...‬ ‪The Earth orbits the Sun...‬ ‪What is it?‬ ‪The Earth orbits the Sun in 24 hours.‬ ‪I don't know how long...‬ ‪No, it's the Earth‬ ‪-that turns on itself in 24 hours.‬ ‪-Oh, yes, that's right.‬ ‪The Sun doesn't move.‬ ‪How does it work?‬ ‪There's the Sun that follows the line.‬ ‪I don't understand‬ ‪why it rises so suddenly.‬ ‪It's really hard to understand.‬ ‪-What time is it now?‬ ‪-3:30 am.‬ ‪It's daylight all the time.‬ ‪It's an endless day.‬ ‪What else can I say?‬ ‪Why don't they have shutters?‬ ‪-It's crazy.‬ ‪-It's weird.‬ ‪It's daylight all the time‬ ‪and not a shutter in sight.‬ ‪-Why not tell your father?‬ ‪-What?‬ ‪-Why not tell your father?‬ ‪-To install shutters?‬ ‪Yeah.‬ ‪Well, none of the houses have shutters,‬ ‪so it may be that, you know,‬ ‪as he's an expat...‬ ‪it would mark him out.‬ ‪I guess he's trying to adapt.‬ ‪OK, but you can install shutters‬ ‪without people stoning you.‬ ‪But your father's really...‬ ‪I don't get it.‬ ‪What? He loves it all.‬ ‪For him, there's no problem.‬ ‪It's as though things pass over him.‬ ‪-Glide!‬ ‪-Yes, "glide". It's weird.‬ ‪-Wasn't he like that before?‬ ‪-Yes, then, too.‬ ‪-But now it's even more visible.‬ ‪-That's crazy.‬ ‪No, it's good that he's changed.‬ ‪My father hasn't.‬ ‪-I said he hasn't changed much.‬ ‪-No, my father.‬ ‪-He's changed?‬ ‪-No.‬ ‪Him neither?‬ ‪-But your father has changed.‬ ‪-No, not much.‬ ‪You never ask me questions.‬ ‪-You're not very curious.‬ ‪-About you?‬ ‪Yeah.‬ ‪Well, that's because‬ ‪I know everything already.‬ ‪That's terrible.‬ ‪You know everything about me?‬ ‪I'm a mysterious person, though.‬ ‪Yeah, that's true.‬ ‪But I never want to know you, actually.‬ ‪You show them, Nathan!‬ ‪Give it all you've got!‬ ‪-Go, Dad!‬ ‪-Go, Nathan!‬ ‪Nathan!‬ ‪He took off fast.‬ ‪He made a good start.‬ ‪The others, too.‬ ‪He has good dogs.‬ ‪-What shall we do now?‬ ‪-We have an hour.‬ ‪-Go home?‬ ‪-Yeah, I'm hungry.‬ ‪-Utter garbage.‬ ‪-What?‬ ‪Nothing.‬ ‪It requires flexibility.‬ ‪Have you never done yoga?‬ &lrm;-Nikilinkingahinga. &lrm;-Nikilinelga. ‪No. &lrm;Nikilinkingahinga.‬ ‪Shit! They must have arrived!‬ ‪You scared me.‬ ‪Yeah!‬ ‪Dad!‬ ‪-Dad, are you OK?‬ ‪-Yes.‬ ‪-Are you OK?‬ ‪-Yes, I'm fine.‬ ‪Are you sure?‬ ‪-Are you feeling OK?‬ ‪-Yes, everything's fine.‬ ‪Will you be OK?‬ ‪-You want to lie down?‬ ‪-No, I'm OK.‬ ‪You'll have to rest, Nathan.‬ ‪Are you taking your medicine?‬ ‪Yes. I feel perfectly fine.‬ ‪What did she say?‬ ‪I had a funny turn.‬ ‪Something I ate. I'm fine.‬ ‪Let's go!‬ ‪Thank you.‬ ‪-Thank you.‬ ‪-Thank you.‬ &lrm;That evening we were invited &lrm;to dinner at Adam's place. &lrm;My father spent the day &lrm;shaking off what had happened. ‪Oops!‬ ‪Go, go!‬ ‪Oh, look at Thomas!‬ ‪Sure you'd rather not postpone tomorrow?‬ ‪What for?‬ ‪-Maybe you'd like to rest.‬ ‪-Rest? I'm in great shape.‬ &lrm;The next day was our introduction &lrm;to seal hunting. &lrm;We left to spend two days &lrm;away from the village with Ole, &lrm;Adam and my father. ‪That's so it isn't thirsty‬ ‪on the way to Paradise.‬ ‪Now we'll cut it up before it freezes.‬ ‪Is that the liver?‬ ‪You must swallow it,‬ ‪and you'll inherit‬ ‪its strength and vision.‬ ‪I have excellent vision,‬ ‪20/20 in both eyes.‬ ‪No, thanks.‬ ‪Go on, swallow it!‬ ‪You'll taste the lens,‬ ‪you'll see it's very good.‬ &lrm;Hi, Lise. &lrm;I'm recording all this, &lrm;I'll show you when I get back. &lrm;I'd like to send it from here, &lrm;but the connection isn't great. &lrm;I hope everything's OK in Paris. &lrm;I'm OK here. &lrm;I'm holding out, even if life is hard. &lrm;We're just pitching our tents, see? &lrm;We've had a day of hunting &lrm;that has wrung us all out. &lrm;Oh, I killed a seal. &lrm;That's good because they're relying on us &lrm;in the village for food. &lrm;Oh, yes, and I ate an eye. &lrm;It's an ancient tradition. &lrm;It's supposed to make you stronger. ‪Anyway, I miss you.‬ ‪Kisses.‬ ‪Last year, there were rumours‬ ‪about a spirit, the Qivittoq, nearby.‬ ‪That worried me.‬ ‪I raised my seal nets near here.‬ ‪I had a head torch.‬ ‪It was pitch black.‬ ‪The torch didn't illuminate very far.‬ ‪I saw I had caught a seal‬ ‪and suddenly, I felt something‬ ‪trying to grab my legs.‬ ‪I was afraid,‬ ‪I turned round quickly to see,‬ ‪and then I remembered‬ ‪I had removed the sleeves of my ski suit.‬ ‪I realized that was what was moving‬ ‪when I leaned over.‬ ‪I really thought I was going to be taken.‬ ‪I really thought that the spirit Qivittoq‬ ‪was going to take me!‬ ‪He was really scared!‬ ‪Thomas?‬ ‪What's the date?‬ ‪I don't know... The 14th.‬ ‪Oh, fuck!‬ ‪What?‬ ‪-Did you do your return?‬ ‪-My what?‬ ‪Your social-security return?‬ ‪Shit! I completely forgot!‬ ‪It's the first time I've forgotten!‬ ‪It's OK.‬ ‪The deadline is in two days,‬ ‪but we mustn't forget or we're dead.‬ ‪Good job you thought of it.‬ ‪You're telling me.‬ ‪Have you digested the seal-eye?‬ ‪Yes, I'd completely forgotten it.‬ ‪-Well, good night.‬ ‪-Good night.‬ ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪The helicopter's coming,‬ ‪we have to go!‬ ‪But I'm staying, Thomas.‬ ‪What do you mean?‬ ‪My place is here now.‬ ‪With this third eye,‬ ‪I have a huge responsibility.‬ ‪I have the power to help them, you see?‬ ‪And I have Nukaka... Nukan...‬ ‪I have Nukankan...‬ ‪And I have Nukannguaq.‬ ‪-You don't feel like petting them.‬ ‪-They're not very endearing.‬ ‪There's a seal on the ice, it's yours!‬ ‪What did he say?‬ ‪Now it's your turn to shoot.‬ ‪You're lucky!‬ ‪He got it!‬ &lrm;Now we'll cut it up before it freezes. ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪Looking at the hunting video.‬ ‪It's gory, isn't it?‬ ‪I didn't think so.‬ ‪It takes a form of insensitivity‬ ‪to say that.‬ ‪It's funny,‬ ‪I'm always the insensitive one.‬ ‪-Don't get upset, I didn't say that.‬ ‪-I'm not, but you did.‬ ‪Well, admit it,‬ ‪you're never moved by anything.‬ ‪You never like the movies you go to see,‬ ‪or the books you read. Is that one good?‬ ‪No, it sucks.‬ ‪You see?‬ ‪Do you like everything?‬ ‪-No, I don't.‬ ‪-Well, then!‬ ‪We're no longer allowed‬ ‪to say a book or a movie sucks.‬ ‪But that's not the point.‬ ‪With you it's systematic!‬ ‪It's called critical thinking.‬ ‪Obviously you don't have it.‬ ‪-Wait, I have no critical thinking?‬ ‪-Not really, no.‬ ‪Forget it, you're a drag.‬ ‪Great line of defence.‬ ‪I don't have to justify‬ ‪liking stuff you don't.‬ ‪We just have to laugh‬ ‪when you mimic Ugolin, that's all!‬ ‪-I don't see the link.‬ ‪-There isn't one.‬ ‪Are you making fun of my Marseille accent?‬ ‪Of course I'm not making fun‬ ‪of your Marseille accent.‬ ‪You're really paranoid.‬ ‪You're paranoid and insensitive.‬ ‪OK, I'm going to sleep,‬ ‪you've made me too angry.‬ ‪Yeah, better stop there. Good night.‬ ‪Yeah, right.‬ ‪Critical mind...‬ ‪-What are you doing?‬ ‪-Going out, I'm not sleepy.‬ ‪Do you mind?‬ ‪Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.‬ ‪I didn't mean what I said.‬ ‪It's not true that‬ ‪you have no critical thought.‬ ‪Don't overdo it.‬ ‪You weren't entirely wrong.‬ ‪I struggle to judge things, people.‬ ‪You're a generous guy, Thomas.‬ ‪Sensitive, eh?‬ ‪I shouldn't have said‬ ‪you were insensitive.‬ ‪And you're right. You should say‬ ‪if you don't like something.‬ ‪Don't forgot,‬ ‪we have to do our returns today.‬ ‪Your father has no Internet.‬ ‪-No, we have to go to the Klubi.‬ ‪-Where is your father, anyway?‬ ‪He went bear hunting with Martika‬ ‪and his son who returned‬ ‪from Upernavik yesterday.‬ ‪They spotted one near the village.‬ ‪Did you work much this month?‬ ‪I've eight fees to declare.‬ ‪Really?‬ ‪I did the trilogy in Bobigny again,‬ ‪you know?‬ ‪And you?‬ ‪I did my three days‬ ‪on a stupid sitcom with that tart.‬ ‪That's it.‬ ‪Mind you, it saved my life this month.‬ ‪Wait for me!‬ &lrm;social security ‪Wow!‬ ‪"&lrm;Fejl&lrm;"?‬ ‪What's that?‬ ‪Ole!‬ ‪Can you come over here, please?‬ ‪What's "&lrm;fejl&lrm;"? It doesn't work.‬ ‪It's not working today. We can do nothing.‬ ‪Try again tomorrow.‬ ‪What's he saying?‬ ‪No idea.‬ ‪Is the Internet not working today?‬ ‪Tomorrow.‬ ‪Thomas?‬ ‪Tomorrow.‬ ‪Tomorrow?‬ ‪No, it's not possible tomorrow, Ole.‬ ‪We have to...‬ ‪The Social Security...‬ ‪-We're both actors.‬ ‪-Part-time.‬ ‪It's entertainment,‬ ‪a special regime.‬ ‪You have to do 507 hours‬ ‪every year.‬ ‪If you don't, you get no money.‬ ‪Understand?‬ ‪Every month, we have to say‬ ‪how many hours we did‬ ‪to make up the 507 hours,‬ ‪because if you...‬ ‪You're... you're a she...‬ ‪you're a sheel... seal hunter.‬ ‪You kill seals, you see?‬ ‪You'd have to kill 507 seals a year.‬ ‪In ten months.‬ ‪In ten months, you have to kill 507 seals.‬ ‪Then you tell the Mayor,‬ ‪"I killed 507 seals",‬ ‪and then you no longer‬ ‪need to hunt for a while.‬ ‪You can stop hunting.‬ ‪At a given point, you're...‬ ‪Come with me.‬ ‪Come.‬ ‪He wants us to follow him.‬ ‪It might come back.‬ ‪Frankly, I doubt it.‬ ‪We'll lose our rights.‬ ‪We'll have to fill in forms,‬ ‪cry in front of a clerk‬ ‪who will lecture us.‬ ‪We'll be missing documents.‬ ‪It'll take months.‬ ‪Meanwhile,‬ ‪we'll have to survive like losers.‬ ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪I'm coming!‬ &lrm;I... &lrm;lou... &lrm;louamik. &lrm;Ilouamik. ‪Come.‬ ‪The connection is restored.‬ ‪Come! Let's go!‬ ‪Slow, isn't it?‬ ‪Yeah!
