I'll come. So swear by the vengeance of the dead. Frederik and I need to be alone. - Well, see you later. - Bye, bye... Why don't you listen in my classes? What? I'm asking: Why do you not listen in my classes? What? Are you naughty? Stand up. It's Krause Frederik! Now comes the big nasty Krause to eat you! I have plenty of time, Mr. Stefan Andersen. It's now 2 o'clock and I'm free until 8 pm. Then we can really get to know each other. Frederik, my boy! Hi, Priest! What are you doing up there? I tried to get closer to God, but then the ladder fell over. Have you messed up again? Yes, I know. I'm a terrible priest. You are the world's best priest! You may think so, but I don't. I mocked God, and now accidents keep happening to me. Fate knows no justice! What's Fate? Fate? It's lukewarm shit... laying in the toilet until someone takes pity and flushes it. If you raise the ladder, I'll give you a gift. Come on! Good! - Come! - It weighs more than my Dad! Come! Frederik? Come here! You're crazy! Are you blind? What the hell are you doing up there? Nothing. I was just about to jump when Frederik arrived. Well, don't mind me. Sweet Marie. Marie, dammit. - We're off. - Marie! Marie! I've told you not to vist that priest. Why not? That's how it is. Fate is lukewarm shit. Who says? No one. He's not timid, huh? He really is. I don't want to hear any more about that priest. Why not? What did I say? Yep, Yep. And stop all the yepping. - Hi, Krause! - Hi. I just stopped by to hand you these. Thank you! You could have given them to Frederik. Well yes, but I was already out driving. See you the next week! Yes, but... I've got a terrible pain in the back, so... Schoolmaster. Does that pay well? No,... Not really It's a minimum subsistence. But I think the old headmaster will retire soon. Headmaster... That must be more interesting. When are we finally going to eat? Would you zip me up? It's a big day for your Dad. Can't we just start? I'm hungry. No, we'll wait. He's just a little late. There would've been a reception. Can I go over to Henriette's after dinner... ... to practice spelling? Since when do you practice spelling with Henriette? Can't I, Mom? Here he comes. Oh, it smells good! Ouch! How did it go? I got twelve cups. - They're beautiful! - Yeah. What about the job? Well... Mogensen got it. You got twelve cups? And twelve teaspoons. Exactly! And Mogensen got the job. Yes. Please wash your hands. aaaahhh... What about you Frederik, are you afraid of a little blood? No. Did you hear what I said, Otto? Just because you work with animals... you don't need to act like one. Now shut the fuck up, you... Or what? My birthday's in two days! Yeah. Yeah, that's true. So I have decided... you'll visit my workplace... on your birthday. - And see the cows? - Yes. - Yep, yep, yep! - Come give your old Dad a hug. He's not going anywhere. - Can't I go, Mom? - No, I said. The men make the decisions in this house. Right, Frederik? Did you do your homework, Frederik? So you won't end up working in a dirty slaughterhouse. Dad? Yes? Have you seen the seahorse? Dad? Yeah? Who makes the decisions in this house? I do! Mommy says I can't go over to Henriette's. Oh. Does she now? You all know the rules. The HumanBeast must find my Dad. The HumanBeast must find your Dad. I have between one and seven teeth in my hand. The one who guesses the number, shall drink from the sacred cauldron... and be reborn as The HumanBeast. Swear by the vengeance of the dead. I swear by the vengeance of the dead! Sacred cauldron. Here's a seagull. Twelve ladybugs. Here's four flies. Two beetles. Here's a mouse. A sparrow. A seahorse. I say Seven. Then I say three. Five. Two. Six. Four. Stop. It's Frederik. You let Frederik go? It's done now. I'm tired of your zoo. I am. How do you think it's been.... 10 years with a man who comes home from work.... smelling of dead cow? How do you think it is... afraid of getting a pelvic infection... because you never wash your hands? Well? Do you think your dead animals excite me? They do, Otto. They do. Just the sight of dead animals, it excites me like crazy! They do! I'm coming! Are you sitting there jerking off? The sacred cauldron has spoken... soon you will be reborn as The HumanBeast. With your HumanBeast's eyes, you'll be able to see what nobody else can see. You'll be able to see into another world. - We salute you. - We salute you. I am The HumanBeast. Don't be afraid, Jesus. You can talk to me. I can hear that which nobody else can. Hey, Jesus. How come... Henriette doesn't have a Dad? Hi, Mogensen. Hi, Mogensen! Hi. This is the balloon hall. Isn't it great? - They're beautiful. - Yes, yes. - They smell. - Yeah, they stink. You could fart and no one would know. Where will they be buried? They won't be buried, they're made into sausages. Stay right here. Mogensen can see you in the camera up there. But he can't hear what you say. Hi, Mogensen! He's doesn't know shit about technology. Incompetent idiot! Look here, Frederik! This is why it's called the balloon hall. That's disgusting. Then close your eyes. Or look away. Now I'll take of it's coat. That's for sausages and the best skin is for... Frederik! Alright. Come here. Come here, come, come here. There's nothing so tender as a teacher's back. But, Mrs. Andersen... Call me Marie. As I said at the parent's conference... Frederik could do a lot better, if he was a bit more... positive towards the teaching. He's always had so much nonsense in his head. With such a Mom he must be very stimulated at home. Now, please turn over. I think my body has had enough for today. Now turn over. You don't get away until I'm finished with you. Well, sorry, it... No need to apologize, I'm used to it. Men can't always control everything. Feel better now? Not really. It gets better when you get hair under your arms. - No. - Let's see. It's coming in soon. No. The girls like it. And I think you're about to get a beard Then you just need big biceps like Dad. Come... You look like a ape. Now it is... exactly a quarter past four. Exactly 10 years since you were born. Close your eyes. No, no, don't cheat. Congratulations. Alligator! It's from Miami. It's called... "Alice Steppe Andersen" They live in some of the world's largest marshlands. - Dad? - Hmm. What is it? Is it true that Henriette doesn't have a Dad? All children have a Dad. - But why doesn't she have one? - She does have. It's just you don't always know where they live. He might be in a swamp in Miami. Heh, yeah. Congratulations, my boy. There's nothing wrong with your back, but... but... if it hurts, you must come again.. Yes, thank you. Thank you. You too. See you. Yes, we will. - Hello, Krause. - Hi. Hi, Frederik. - That's a beautiful machine. - Thank you. Frederik Happy Birthday It's just you, Priest! I bought a little gift for you. How is it? It's very cool. Come here. Look into this one. Yep, yep. What is it? Yep, yep. It's a church measurement tool. - Not true! - It's true. Take a look. Ok, keep looking! Does it look crazy? Look again, keep looking! Keep looking! Now look! Aarrg... Frederik! Frede, Frede! Stop! Do you have much hair under your arms? Hair under the arm? Priests don't have that. It's God's will. The girls like it. My Dad says. Hair has never really been my strong side. So that's why you're not married! I don't think so. Nowadays, decent girls just don't want a a priest. Those who do are so boring that I don't want them. Ole and Henriette, they're married. Love can be cruel and capricious. Can't they divorce? You're just like me, Frederik... We have the longing in the blood, a large hole in the stomach. Can't we just pray to God, Priest? The only thing is that... God isn't really what he... used to be. What is he then? Well, maybe he's a little red-haired girl... Perhaps he's a tree, a gas... I think the whole thing becomes more and more diffuse. What's "diffuse"? It's when... things slip through the fingers. It's only cowards who becomes priests. Once you become a priest, God puts an eye on each finger. Can I see? I'll never be The HumanBeast! Japanese tourists were at the church this morning. They wanted to buy it. They thought I owned it. Wanted to turn it into a recording studio. Should I sell the church? Then I could start over. In Mexico. You must not! I forbid it. You can ride along in the trunk No, I won't. They have guns in Mexico. I'd rather be with my Dad and Mom. Well, I'd better run home. Mom says you'll give her a nervous breakdown. Yep! Yep, yep! Well, better get going. Well? What about Otto? - What about him? - Did he get the job at the factory? It's not settled yet. Well, interesting. So when will it be decided? I don't know. That hasn't been decided either. He's not career-minded. Never has been. Not everybody cares about that. Otto has other interests. Stuffing animals. Otto is quite zoologically gifted. Zoological perhaps. If you ask me... the priest has far more personality. Of course, everyone's free to choose Yes. They are. And he and Frederik get on well. It's a real pity that you're barren... You who know children so well. Hello, my darling. What kind of a fine crocodile is that? It isn't a crocodile. It's an alligator. If godmother says crocodile, then it's a crocodile. Speak properly to her. He ​​does! I can't help that I was born with a longing in my blood... like the priest. Well,... I think your customer has arrived. He looks like a biker... Why does he have to come here? You said that bikers were disgusting. Had enough coffee? It does looks like it. Frederik? Frederik, is that you? Frederik? Frederik? Hi, HumanBeast I am The HumanBeast? I can see... into another world Show of hands. Henriette? Hissing Beast 10 deciliter... equals 100 centiliters... equals 1000 milliliters... I am The HumanBeast! I can see into another world! I am The HumanBeast! I can see into another world! The HumanBeast! What's making that noise? That's just Frederik from my class. Frederik? Why is he yelling like that? Because he has a new bike. Mom? What's it, darling? Frederik's Mom says you were once in the loony bin. Now, now. How's that? You still married to Ole? No, we separated two days ago. Now you're my little HumanBeast. What are you doing? Styling your hair. Would you like your hair shorter, Sir? No, I actually want it a little longer. Henriette. I've told you not to play in the salon. Come here! Customers come here! It's not a toy store! Frederik is maladjusted! Do you understand? I'm not allowed around you because you're maladjusted. What's that? Frederik? Please go home to your Mom, who apparently has no inhibitions, when it comes to men. whether teachers or priests, they're all the same to her. You said yourself that Krause was sexy. Frederik? Your Mom is a bitch... and you're probably a bastard. Can you really see what no one else can see? Then, HumanBeast, who's my Dad? I'll marry Henriette when I get hair under my arms. You can't, Frederik. Why not? Because it's me who's married to Henriette. The HumanBeast can do anything. And you don't have underarm hair either. I'm not wrong. The HumanBeast! Hi. Bikers should not come here anymore. No, Frederik. Swear by the vengeance of the dead. Both Hands. Yep... It's okay. In this house... remember it's The HumanBeast who decides. Why do you have cotton in the keyhole? Frederik peeks in. Why aren't you honest, baby sister? You're still crazy about that priest. What? I think he still loves you. I think so. Hey, stop! What are you doing? Hey, stop. What? Dad? Yes? Was Mom the priest's girlfriend? Was she? Your Mom knew other men, before she met me. I don't think a priest was among them. You sure? Yes! Absolutely sure? Yes. Now get up to Mogensen. Yep. Dad? Yes? The HumanBeast knows about Mom... ...things you don't know. We'll talk about it during break. Now, go. Hi, Dad! My Dad says you don't understand technical stuff. Well, does he? You know who's the boss here? My Dad is more important than you. Your Dad is the lowest paid here. What the devil? My Dad's more important than you. You can't figure out technical stuff. Shut up. Look Mogensen, the cows are swinging. Fuck, man! Damn it to hell! Dad! Dad! Ages shall come to be, Ages shall pass away, Kindred shall follow the path of kin. A never-to-be-silenced, tone from the heavens, in the joyful soul's pilgrim song. Merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ Otto Steppe... From dust you came... to dust you return. From dust shall you rise again. Marie. Sacred cauldron. My Dad is all too dead. We can't keep all of them here? Hey, listen. I've been thinking that we could make it really nice up here. Then you can have it as your room. Frederik. Wouldn't you prefer this room instead? Hmm? Afraid of a bit of blood? Are you? Mom! Mom! There was a live bird. It flew out. Who is it? Niels. Hi. Hi. Frederik? You're my best friend. The others are all fools. Don't understand a damned thing. Their heart's in their ass. Frederik, my boy. Let's play darts? Come on, baby. Was it fun? No. Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Do you know who'll be your new headmaster? No. Who? I... I've invited him here for a glass of champagne. Who is it, Mom? It's... It's Krause. Frank Krause. You promised that the bikers wouldn't come here anymore. Stop it, Frederik. It's only a glass of champagne. I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dying! Stop it, Frederik. Help! Now get up and eat your food. I'm dying! Enough with that dying-shit! Do you hear? I'll go crazy! Thanks, Thanks. First of all, I want to thank the teachers and parents, and those... who supported my appointment as headmaster. I will do my utmost to live up to the trust you have shown me. Are you sad, Frederik? No. It's a shame that your Dad is dead. It's really a shame for you. My Dad isn't really dead. What's he then? He's no more dead than so many others. That's a lie. Frederik's Dad is dead. My Dad isn't really dead, Ole. He's as dead as that. I'll smash you. You think I'm afraid just because your Dad is dead? What's going on? Ow, ow! Hi, Frederik. Come congratulate your new Headmaster. Stop it. Ow! It doesn't matter. You must never kick people. Marie, let him just be. Stop it right now! You're a Bitch! Who says so? The priest? Bitch! Bitch! You stop it! No I won't! I can very, very quickly create a scandal! Stop it! You'll fuck Marie, but you won't fuck me! Keep your mouth shut! You'll fuck Marie, but you won't fuck me! I live across from you, you can see me every day! I'm living there with your daughter! Your daughter! Your daughter! - That's a lie. - It's true! - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. He's not my Dad. You're so crazy, Frederik. I heard it myself. My Dad is dead, just like yours. My Dad isn't really dead. Frederik, you are becoming more and more maladjusted. Potato Art. It's really amazing. You cook a primo potato. Thank you, Frank. Stop it. You'll end up in the loony bin, just like Henriette's Mom. Frederik. Look what I've bought for you. Now you just watch, honey. Gross! Get away! Your hair has biker scabies. A motorcycle-car model deluxe 2. What do you say to that? Isn't it cool? Lets go for a trip? Krause is Henriette's Dad. Stop that nonsense, Darling. Stop it! - You nasty boy. - It's HumanBeast spit. It will never come off. I'll take care of this. What the hell is going on with you? You can't treat your Mom like that. Did you hear what I said! Do you know what you are? You are just a silly little boy. The dead will take vengeance on you. What did you say? The dead will take vengeance on you, and your disgusting, filthy body. You don't hit my little boy! Is that clear? Yes. If you ever hit him, I'll never see you again. I'll leave now. Frank? Ali... If one day you come alive... then you must eat him. Krause is Henriette's Dad! Krause is Henriette's Dad! Krause is Henriette's Dad! Stop that yelling! Krause is Henriette's Dad! Krause is Henriette's Dad! Who's shouting? It's not true, is it Mom? What's not true? Nothing, Mom. I will do everything for you and Frederik. He's become so strange. He doesn't look me in the eyes anymore. He stares at me as if I'm a stranger. I've got a little surprise for you. Wedding Invitations? Fucking great, Frank Krause! Let's just get married right away. I'm so impressed with your situational awareness. I am! Biker thugs! Biker thugs! I'll take care of it. Biker thugs! Frederik? You mustn't do that, little boy. Frederik? What's the rush? You haven't seen me, okay? - Good evening, Mr. Krause. - Good evening. What brings you here? God, or... racing? Frederik Steppe Andersen, have you seen him? No. Hardly anyone comes to church, so I'd have noticed. I can't get over it. Who Fate can bring together... You must never marry them. Right, Priest? Your Mother, and that biker thug? Do you promise? Yep, yep. Hi, Marie. You don't want to? Yes. Yes, that's how you should see it. Then you'll never see Frederik again. I'll see Frederik just as much as it suits me. Just relax. Marie! When I got home, you'd already given birth to Frederik. And had married Otto. You know... he could just as easily be mine. No. Yes, you do. How should I know? I fucked Otto in the evening... And made love to you in the day. I really don't know. Marie! I expect it to be the finest church wedding in the city's history. No more will I be Frederik Steppe Andersen. Now I'll only be The HumanBeast. Will you marry Henriette Beast-Hansen? Yep. And will you marry Frederik Beast-Andersen? Yep. Then swear by the vengeance of the dead. We swear by the vengeance of the dead. Now you are married, in all realms, forever. Amen. Frederik. Marie! Marie! You can't be serious! You can't marry that fool! Marie! What about Frederik? Listen, I think you should go home and care of your own family. Can't you see you're destroying Frederik? because you can't restrain yourself. Slut. - You're can't call me a slut. - You're a slut! A horny slut. Marie requests we start with hymn number 738. How lovely it is to journey together for two, who would be joined to each other for their joys increase to be shared by two, and their griefs divided to halve their burdens. Yes, it is merry, no need to tarry, on wings aloft, that will, us carry upheld in love upheld in love. Now I ask you, Frank Krause, do you take Marie Andersen, who stands by your side, as your wife? Yes. Will you love and honor her... in prosperity and adversity... in what fortune God Almighty, will send you... as a husband should live with his wife... until death do you part? Yes. Likewise I ask you, Marie Andersen, Do you take Frank Krause, who stands by your side, as your husband? If you're involved in this, I'll kill you. Frederik! Don't jump! Sweet little Frederik!
