(mellow moving music) (tense music) (people chattering) - [Man] Ooh, hey, what you gonna do with that? Hey, John, John! (somber music) (thudding) (guitar cracking) (mellow music) (lighthearted music) - You got it? - Okay, everybody, come on, hurry up. He's gonna be here any minute. Oh, Dede it looks great. - Thanks. You look really pretty, Mom. - Oh, well, thanks. What do you think about the colors of this shirt? - Honey, you look great. Now, you should try to relax. Remember to breathe every once in a while. - Yeah, I know, breathe. Well, you know, two years, three months, 11 days, 18 hours. (chuckles) Who's counting? (melancholic music) I just want this to be a really nice home. Okay, everybody, come on, come on now. Bobby, your brother's home! Come on, here he comes! Ah, welcome home, Kenny! Oh, Kenny! - Wow, geez. - Oh darling, welcome home, Kenny Carlson. Oh! - This is so sweet of you, Mom, you didn't have to do this. - We wanted to make this a really special homecoming for you, baby. - It is. (chuckles) Oh, my god. Look at you. Oh, wow. - I missed you. - Look at you! Your growing up so fast. The boys must be slitting their wrists, huh? - Oh really, come on. - Ian Matthews. Welcome home. - It's good to meet you. Thank you for the job interview. - Work hard and make her happy. That's all the thanks I need. - Yeah, I will. - Oh, baby. - Yeah. (video game beeping) What's up, Termite? - My name's Bobby. - Bobby. - I know your name, lil' brother. That's all right. - I don't know what's the matter with Bobby. He's been looking forward to this for so long. - Oh, don't worry about it, Mom. I know he has. He's just nervous. His big brother just came home from prison. (laughs) Wow! What a feeling. You have no idea how good it feels just to be able to open up a refrigerator and take whatever you want. Wow. Ian, how about a beer? - Wait a minute. Hold, I've got cake and ice cream over here. - Oh, right, Mom. (laughs) Top of the world, Ma. (crickets chirping) How long you been standing there? - Couple of seconds. Like lookin' at you. Haven't been able to do that in a couple of years. - Anybody been driving the truck? - [Sharon] You kiddin', that bag of bolts? Hadn't moved two inches in two years. - It's a '54 Chevy five-window pickup. I know guys who'd kill for that. How 'bout I fix it? - I want you to do whatever makes you happy. I want you to start your new life. (grunts) (Sharon sighs) - So tell me about the duke, huh? - The duke? - John Wayne? (scoffs) The cowboy. - Kenny, come on. - What? - Well, Ian's back at the ranch. He sleeps there most of the time. - And why's that? He looks like a good guy. What are you two waitin' for, huh? - Well, because we're dating. - Old-fashioned. I like that. (laughing) - Oh, boy. I can't believe this is true. (mellow music) Feel like I'm dreamin' and I'm gonna wake up. - It's not a dream. More like the end of a nightmare. - Yeah. - Long nightmare. Two years of my life. - It's over. - Is it? I don't know. They say coming out of prison, it's rough. - You're gonna make it. I believe in you. - I love you. - I love you. - And I'm sorry for all the things that I've done. - Oh, now. (hushing) - The things that I should've done and I didn't do and the things that... What a mess. Here, I should've been making you proud instead- (hushing) - You're home now and everything's gonna be just like it was. No more troubles. (knocking) - Yeah? - Termite. What you readin'? - Usual crap, you know, brain-rotting stuff. You want somethin'? - [Kenny] Well, how do you feel about me taking this top bunk tonight? - In here with me? - If you don't like it, that's cool. - No, man, that'd be great. Sure. - All right. (Kenny chuckles) Oh, man, these sheets feel good. - Night, Kenny. - [Kenny] Goodnight, buddy. - Kenny? - Yeah, buddy? Just wondering. Are you okay? I mean, you know, I saw this prison movie on cable where they took this guy in the laundry room. - Wait a minute. Is that what you've been so quiet about since I got home? Listen, buddy, nothing happened. I'm fine. - Really? - Nothing happened. (melancholic music) - [Bobby] Kenny? - [Kenny] Yeah. - I'm glad you're okay 'cause in the movie, they hurt the guy real bad. (birds chirping) - Whoa! - You wouldn't guess where I learned how to fix engines. - This is great! I can't believe you did this. - Well, all it needed was a couple of new plugs, clean out the carbs a little. What do you say we let Dede take Bobby to school in the sedan? You and I can take the truck. - Absolutely. - Right this way, milady. - Thank you. - There you go. Yeah, this looks like the place. - [Sharon] All right. - Now, you remember how to drive this thing? - Oh, come on! I taught you, didn't I? You nervous? - Yeah, little bit. - You're a good mechanic. You remember that. Well, I don't know anybody else who could've fixed this thing. I love you. - [Kenny] I love you too. - Bye. - [Kenny] Let me. - Watch out. - All right. - Comin' through. - Can I help you, son? - Yeah, I'm Kenny Carlson. Ian Matthews spoke to you about me. - Oh, right, right. I clean forgot. How long you been home? - [Kenny] Since last night. - So, you know anything about boats? - Some. Plus I worked the motor pool while I was, while I was away. - So what were you in for? Figure I got a right to know if you're gonna be working here. - Yeah, armed robbery. Me and a couple of buddies were out drinking one night and they jacked a convenience store. I was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. Listen, no excuses, I was there. I could've split but I didn't. I understand if you don't wanna take a chance. A lot of people feel that way. - I got no problem. You work hard, keep your nose clean, that's all I ask. It's eight bucks an hour. You might as well get started if you want it. Tools are in the truck. Number 26 needs an oil change. Need to varnish those rails. And stow the rest of this gear in the box. (lighthearted music) - Yes, sir. (people chattering) - Chili de Mackie. Changed the recipe. All right, what do you think? What do you think? - Oh whoa, I can feed myself. - All right, go to it. Give it to me straight, doc. - Hold on, it's hot. - It's supposed to be hot. It's chili for cryin' out loud. - You're a genius. - I know that, but how does the chili taste? - You know, if I take some home to Kenny, bet he'll love it too. - Excuse me, genius. Table four is still waitin' on their veal chops. - Hey! They want it now or do they want it cooked? It's ready when it's ready. - Mackie, I was wondering if I could leave a little early today. - Why don't you invite table four into the kitchen? They can cook it themselves. Sharon, that's the fifth time in two weeks. - Well, yeah, I know but kinda like to be there when Kenny gets home. You know, he's been working so hard and- - Yeah but look, the crowd's just barely starting to come in. - Bet Claire could cover for me, couldn't you? - Oh, of course, Claire could cover, why not? - Good, okay. - Hey, thanks, Mack. - Nelson Mandela didn't get this much attention when he got out. - Look, I'd like to see one of your kids walk a mile in Kenny's shoes. See how far he'd get. - Kenny's shoes. Probably stole 'em. - [Sharon] Kenny? (tense music) Kenny is that you? Kenny? - Is that how you greeted Kenny when he came back? - He didn't tell me you were out. - He doesn't know yet. I just got here. - How'd you get in? - Key, behind the bushes under the stone. Just where Kenny said it'd be. Learn a lot about a guy after two years in prison together. Mm-mm-mm, home cookin'. Ah, the things I missed in prison. You'd be surprised what you learn to live without. Why don't you just say it? - Why don't I just say what? - That you don't want me around. - Look, you and Kenny were friends in prison. I don't want to take away from that. But he's got a real chance to start fresh now. He's got a real chance. - Thanks for having me. (bird squawking) On your knees and wiping up somebody else's grease. (chuckles) You don't mind my saying so, it's not how I pictured you on the outside. - When'd you get out? - Couple of days ago. - Yeah, well, you scared my mom. She called here all upset. Don't do that again. - She doesn't want me to be around. (chuckles) She figures I'm a bad influence on you. - Where you gonna stay? - With you. You don't mind, do you? - Listen, Warren, things are gonna be different now. Meet me at that restaurant, top of the road, in 30 minutes. We'll talk about it. - You know, Ian invited us to his place this weekend. Kids can't go. You know, they got plans with their friends. So I was thinking though, maybe you'd go with me. - Is it all right if Warren comes? - You know you never even told me Warren was coming here. - Mom, I didn't know. Listen, he's not gonna stay very long. - He makes me nervous. - [Kenny] Warren? - Yeah. - [Kenny] He's nothin' but mouth. - You know, I wish you'd really try to find yourself some new friends. - Come on, it's only been a couple of weeks. People aren't exactly lining up to be friends with an ex-con. But I'm gonna try, I promise. But in the meantime, you know I didn't have much choice of friends up there. Should cut Warren some slack. - Okay. Why don't you go out there and get him? Tell him dinner's ready. (mellow music) - Warren, it's beautiful, isn't it? And we're not even at peak color yet. - After gray, any color seems like a lot. (chuckles) I like it, all the trees and stuff. - Warren where'd you grow up? - Tulsa, mostly. I like it here, though. - [Kenny] I thought he lived up here in Clayton Ridge. Why are you turning here? - Well, it's my own private shortcut. Found it about the third time I came up here. Ah, it takes a little longer to get there but it sure is pretty. - It takes longer. That's some shortcut for you. That's my mom. (chuckles) - So, Warren, what are your plans? - Oh, he's gonna go to work with me. - Oh. - Warren, you know anything about boats and engines? - What he doesn't know, I'll teach him. I'm not gonna be polishing rails forever either, no. Old Pritchard's old-fashioned. One of these days, I'm gonna be running the whole place the way it should be run. - W.K. Charters. - K.W. Charters, letters overlaid in maritime logo. - Sweet. How about a beer? - No, thanks, I'm driving. - Maybe next time. Mama, you know what? One of these days I'm gonna buy you one of these places up here. Big ol' view. - Oh, yeah? - You can charge a toll to all them rich drivers going by on your shortcut. - Oh, stop it! Don't tickle me while I'm driving! Kenny, I told you stop it. Stop it. - [Kenny] Oops! - [Sharon] Tickling mode! (Kenny laughing) (mellow music) - How you doin', Ian? Good to see you again. - Good to see you. - [Sharon] Hi, honey. - This is Warren Stubbs. - Welcome. - Hey. Nice wheels. Must've set you back 30 grand, at least, huh. - Thereabouts. Hey. - Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry. That's Kenny's friend from prison, you know, I told you about. I hope you don't mind. I couldn't say no. - No problem. As long as you're here. Come on. - Okay. (horse neighing) - [Ian] There you go. - All right. Look at you. You teach her how to ride like that? - [Ian] Oh, she's a natural. - Yeah. Hey, Warren. Is it okay? - Sure. You know how to ride Warren? - I grew up in friggin' Oklahoma, man. (Kenny laughing) (horse neighing) - Are you all right? - I'm from friggin' Oklahoma, man. - Shut up! - Oh, I'm sorry. You're a regular Lakota tribesman. You know what, take off that saddle. These Native Americans like to ride bareback. - Just shut up, Kenny! I ain't no friggin' Indian. - Oh, could've fooled me, Tonto. - Yeah, well, you don't know what you're talking about, man. I grew up with 'em. Ain't nothing but a bunch of filthy drunks. Oughta be sent back where they come from. - I think this is where they come from. - Kenny, come on. Bring the horse, come on. - Now, it isn't my business who you hate or why. You're a friend of Kenny's so I won't kick your racist butt into next week. - Go ahead, I'll be right back. - But if I hear you talk like that again, you're outta here. - That's my mother's boyfriend. He got me my job. Don't screw this up for me. Gettin' ready to pop the question, I imagine. - [Sharon] Oh, geez. - [Kenny] Well, I know about these things. - [Warren] How touching. (belches) - [Sharon] Oh damn. - [Kenny] What's wrong? - We ran out of gas. I thought we'd make it. I should've filled it up. - Oh, great. We had to take your scenic shortcut, geez! - Well, Warren I'm really sorry. - Warren. - Well, there ain't gonna be another damn car on this road for hours. - All right, Warren, shut up. All right, get out. - Out? - Get out. - There's snakes outta here. - Don't worry about it. We'll take care of everything. - Kenny where you goin'? - Mom, don't worry. Stay here. I'll take care of it. Warren and I will cut up through the woods to the main highway and get us some help. - You just be careful. - I will, don't worry. Let's go. - There's poison oak in there. - [Kenny] Warren, let's go. - [Warren] Ow, ow! Snakes! Ow! - [Kenny] Watch your step, there's... There's the road. (Warren muttering) - Man, nobody in their right mind's gonna stop here. We'll be stuck out here all night. - No, there's somebody coming right now. - Hey, what's the problem, guys? - Hey, we're stuck down on this little side road down here, ran out of gas. My mother is with me. - Is she okay? - Yeah, she's fine but she's a little bit embarrassed 'cause she forgot to get gas. - Well, I tell you what. I'll drive your friend here to the gas station. Why don't you stay here with your mother? You don't want her out here alone in the woods. - Oh, yeah, that'd be great. What's your name? - Mark, Mark Willis. - Hey, I'm Kenny Carlson. This is Warren Stubbs. - It's nice to meet you, Kenny. Hop on in, Warren. - I appreciate it. - [Mark] Sure thing. - Kenny? - Yeah, Ma. - [Sharon] Oh, oh, baby. - We got some help. - Oh, good. - Nothing to worry about. Warren will be back here pretty soon with some gas. - All right, oh, good. Ooh. - I told you not to worry about him. - Yeah, well. He's a good guy. - Ooh. Oh, yeah. - That better? - Oh, yeah. I'd forgotten how you're the only one who can get that creak out of my neck. - That's right. You missed me, huh? - What do you think? You know, when I was a little girl, I used to go to sleep at night looking at the stars and making wishes. - Did any of those wishes come true? - Yeah, you did. - Well, Mom, if I was what you were wishing for, you must've pissed God off real bad. - That's not true. You're the most precious gift I ever got. You know what? I made another wish tonight. For you to have a brand new start. And that one's gonna come true too. - Yeah. - [Sharon] Oh, Warren. (tense music) - [Kenny] Ma? - Yeah? - Look at this, three gallons of gas. - Oh, good. - Plenty to get us home, huh? - Yeah. - Hey, Mom, I'm gonna run up and give something to this man that helped us out, okay? He was real good. Probably nobody else around here would've done that. - I'll meet you at the junction. - Okay. (tense music) Where the hell'd you find that? - The guy, he had this under his seat. Yeah, but he never saw me take it. - Yeah, well, damn, she might have seen it! How come he didn't come down here and bring us the gas himself? - I guess he didn't feel like coming down here. I guess he felt like sitting in his fancy SUV. I guess I have no idea why he didn't. (animal hooting) (somber music) - Kenny? Kenny, you still here? Oh, great guys. Leave me out here in the middle of nowhere to drive home alone. (tense music) (phone beeps) - [Mark] Hi, honey. Sorry I'm late getting back but I see you aren't home from Millie's yet either. Reason I'm late, I stopped to help a couple of young guys and their mom near Clayton Ridge. Well, I'll see you later. Save me a piece of that cobbler. I love you, bye. (phone beeps) - It's only been a few hours. - Please, look for him. It's not like him to just disappear like this. He's always stopping to help people. - Nice guy, huh? Well, I can't officially do anything for 48 hours. Why don't I do this? Why don't I do this? Why don't I go up to the ridge and I'll ask some folks if anybody saw anything, okay? - Thank you. - We'll find him. He'll turn up, okay? - Oh, hi, honey. Heard from Kenny? - Yeah, he's in the kitchen. - Oh, where has he been? - [Dede] I don't know. - By the way, where you goin'? - Over to Skip's to study for the trig test. - Ah, Skip, Skip, Skip who? Do I know Skip? - His family just moved here from LA. - Oh, yeah, yeah, the big house near Stanton's. I'm impressed. - Well, don't start buying any baby clothes. (chuckles) - Oh-oh-oh. (sighs) Okay, Kenny. Don't hide from me. - [Kenny] I ain't hiding from you. I'm trying to fix this sink. When's the last time somebody looked at these pipes? - Well, probably since before you left home. Kenny, how could you do that? - Do what? Oh hey, did you see the check I left for you? Figured I'd keep one of 'em out of the month, give the rest to you. - Yeah, I got it. It'll really help. Thanks a lot. Let's get back to the subject. You left me alone in the middle of the night. - What're you talkin' about? What, leaving you alone on your very own shortcut which I'm sure you've been on alone before. You had gas which Warren went to go get for you. What's the problem? Eh? Just like new. This family really missed me. - Well, don't make me guess. Tell me what happened. - Well, that guy Willis was cool. We bought him a beer to say thank you. Hung out for a little while and by the time I got home, it was time to get dressed and go to work. That's it. Case closed. - Sure wish I'd known. - Mom, I'll tell you what, I'm sorry. But if I got to ask your permission every time I wanna go get a drink, I may as well be back in jail. Maybe I should just move out. - Yeah, that's what I want you to do. I want you to move out, I haven't missed you. Oh, come on, Kenny, I was just worried. You want me to make you a sandwich, huh? huh? - No, thank you, hey. - You're lookin' thin, Lookin' thin. - I'm going to bed. Good night. - Good night. Thank you, sweetie. - [Kenny] You're welcome. (sighs) (chuckles) (people chattering) - [Man] You know what, a friend of mine had a burger. - Eat from your own plate. - Excuse me, it was just sitting there. - Yeah, well, maybe I was gonna eat it. - Hey, you guys stop fighting. My mom works here. You want more, she'll bring us more. - [Skip] Your mom's a hottie. - If my mother worked in a place like this, I'd never set foot in the joint. She'd be all over me. Don't pick at your food. Where's your manners? - She's pretty cool. Never really gets on my case. - I could use that in my life. My folks want every detail of every day like they give a damn. - No, no, no, just some coffee, just some coffee. Thanks. And how about a dozen donuts? I'm kidding. (people chattering) Sharon Carlson? - Yeah, that's right. - That Matthews fella told me that I could find you here. - Who, Ian? - Yeah, yeah, I spent the morning interviewing everyone up on Clayton Ridge. He said that you and your sons needed a little help with your car the other night. - Son. Singular. The other kid's a friend of his. And yes, a man did help us. We ran out of gas. Stupid me. It was a nice thing for him to do. Why, somethin' wrong? - What's with the cop? - They're probably here about her brother follow up or something. - [Skip] Her brother? - Two years for stealing, just got out on parole. - Sweet. Let's go. - Thanks a lot. It's nobody's business where my brother's been. - Excuse me, it's not like he was in a resort for two years. - Wish I could tell you more but I never saw him to say thank you. - Maybe I should talk to your boy Kenny. Ms. Carlson, the wife of this missing man, she's just worried sick that something terrible has happened to him. I think anything we could do to help ease her mind would be a help. - He'll be home around seven. - Seven o'clock tonight. - Yeah. - Thank you. (tense music) So, Kenny, your mother tells me that you and your friend and Mr. Willis went out for a drink after he helped you. Which bar did you go to? - No, sorry about that. My mother is wrong. We went and drank. He had a bottle in his car. - Sorry. - It's all right. We went up to Gopher Pass up off by 115. - Yeah, right, okay. - We sat there and we drank for a while and we talked and then when we were through, he took us back to the Jack Frost Diner and he was saying how his wife was gonna be all pissed off at him and that was it. Me and Warren had some breakfast and we went to work. - What's Warren's last name? - Stubbs. - Mm-hm. And do you know where he is right now? - I don't know about that. - All right. Is there anything else you can think of, either of you? - No, not me. - You know, I hope he's all right. I didn't know how to thank him. He was... Not very many people who would've helped us out in that kind of a situation. - Okay. All right, well, here's my card. You can call me if you think of anything else, either of you, and Kenny thanks for having me. - Sure. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you, good night. - [Kenny] Take care. - [Harley] Okay. - Huh. - How could you do that? You're my mother. You're supposed to protect me. - Kenny, what are you talking about? I just told him what you told me. You didn't take that man's car. - Mom, I've been in jail. All right, the police are automatically gonna figure that I'm responsible for every crime that happens in this county. - Did you take his car? - Yes, all right? We did. Mom, because he was talking about how much money he had and the big giant ski chalet and that he and his wife were gonna go off and go to Europe for the spring. - Honey, what else did you do? - Mom, we didn't do, we didn't hurt him, I promise. If somebody else hurt that guy, they did it after we were there. - Warren. See, I knew it was Warren. I knew if you hung around with Warren that something would happen. Did you even think about your parole? Did you even have any idea what could happen? - Yes, of course, I did. And it's gonna be the same thing that always happens to me. I end up doing hard time for something that doesn't deserve a slap on the wrist. (tense music) (people chattering) - [Police Officer] Hey, Tom, right down here. (camera clicks) (tense music) (people chattering) Three more over here. Careful with that. Hey, Tom. (camera clicks) - So, how do I already know this is gonna be Mark Willis? - Well, the clothes match but it's hard to tell. Look what somebody's done to this poor bastard. (police dispatch speaking faintly) - And the body, found in a deserted area off State Highway 115, has been identified as that of Mark Willis, a Gold Ridge man who had been missing for the past three days. - Flip it back. - Why? - Just flip it back, I wanna hear it. - [Reporter] Mr. Willis was 45 years old, married with- - No, Kenny, wait a minute, wait, wait. Have you seen this? - What? - In other news, gun fire rang through the streets of Los Angeles again today. - No, no, wait, not this. There was another story about Mr. Willis. He was murdered. - Mr. Willis? - The man who helped us on the road, they found his body. - [Reporter] Recent gang shooting- - My god, that's awful. What did they say? - Kenny, did you have anything to do with this? - Mom, I know what you must be thinking, no! Listen to me, I told you, we had nothing else to do with that, nothing. (TV reporter speaking faintly) Mom, come on, I know I've made some stupid mistakes in my life but do you really think I could do something like this, huh? - [Reporter] At the airport after- - No. Somebody else killed that poor man. We just happened to see him before it happened, that's all. Okay? All right. - Go get washed up. - [Reporter] That reported the drugs in South America- (people chattering) - Hi, can I show you to a table? Is that you? - Yeah. Hi, Sharon. - Donna Basely? - Well, it's Mulroney now. I finally took the plunge. - Ah, well, good for you. - You look great, really. How do you do it? - Well, so do you. - Thanks. - And as I recall, you worked for the DA's office. - Yeah. - So you didn't just happen in here. You came in here to talk to me about Kenny. - Yeah. - It's okay. We can talk. I'll take a break. Talk outside, huh? - Great. - Be back in 10 minutes. - I'm a mother too, Sharon. I have three kids. I think maybe I understand. - Well, then you understand I'm gonna be awfully careful what I say to you. - Look, all I want is to find whoever killed Mark Willis. - Kenny swears he didn't do it. - And I'm not saying he did. Things aren't always what they seem. If he had nothing to do with it, then he has nothing to worry about. - He is on parole. - I won't bust his parole if he's not involved with the murder. - You can't promise that. - I might be able to. It all depends on what he knows and what he's connected to. - You know, I used to really envy you in school. - What? That's a laugh. I would've given anything to attract the boys the way you did. - Oh, right, yeah. Look where it got me. - Sharon, if something happened you can't make it unhappen. - I will protect my son. Bye. Bye bye. Bobby, could you get in here and eat dinner with the rest of us, huh? - [Bobby] I'm watching TV. I'll eat in here. - Oh, sorry, Mom. I'll grab something later. - All right. Did you clean the house? - Yup, everything except Kenny's stuff. He didn't want me to touch it. - Okay, don't be too late. - [Dede] I won't. - Hey. What we got here? Oh, so glad I could come home for all this home cooking. - Well, you're running off too, huh? - Yeah, I told Warren I'd meet him up at Wes's. - You know, a woman came to see me at the diner today. Girl I went to high school with. - Is that right? - Yeah. - She still look as pretty as you do? - Smooth-talker. Actually, she worked for the DA's office. (tense music) - What did you tell her? - Nothing. But I'm worried, sweetheart. They found Warren's prints all over Mr. Willis's truck. - Well, of course, they did, Mom. We took his truck. - Would you talk to her? - I don't know. Come on, Mom, it's been almost a week. I don't know what happened to that guy. I'm sorry that he's dead but I don't wanna go back to prison for something that I didn't do. - [Sharon] Uh-huh. - Hey, I'm going into town. You wanna take a ride with me? - No, thanks. Better finish up some things here. - If it makes you feel better, I'll talk to her, okay? - Thanks. - But only if she promises me that they're not gonna pull my parole for jacking that guy's truck. - All right. - I mean, you know what's gonna happen there. I'm gonna help 'em solve their murder and they're gonna send me back to prison. That's not fair. - No. - I love you. - Love you. Have fun. (sighs) (friends chattering) - [Girl] You know, all of us together. ♪ You always seem to be upset ♪ ♪ Then I go, where I've been ♪ - [Woman] You look thirsty. - Thanks. - You're new around here, aren't you? ♪ Questioning of what I do ♪ - Actually, I've just been away for a while. I grew up here, though. - Really?

What's your name? (mellow music) (somber music) Little bit early for a boat ride, Ma. - Spoke to Donna from the DA's office this morning about your parole. She said she couldn't promise anything but she would have some influence with the judge if it comes to that. - You think that's good enough? - I think it would be better if we tell them everything we know so they could find the real killer and leave you alone. - What are you talking about? I told you, we got drunk, we roughed him up a little bit and we took his truck. We were all three drunk. - Mr. Willis was a diabetic. There wasn't a drop of alcohol in his system, Kenny. Tell me the truth. - The truth. What do you know about the truth? You wanna help me, believe me. - Oh, my Kenny, you are lying to me. - I am not lying to you. - You're lying. - No, stop it. Stop it. - How do you explain this? (somber music) - Where did you get that? - Didn't do a very good job of getting rid of it, did you? - Trying to protect you. I'm trying to protect you. - To protect me? From what? - From Warren. He killed that man who helped us. He started going crazy. He was talking crazy and he was... And then all of a sudden, before I knew it, he had pulled that guy out of the truck. I was so afraid to look. I could hear him, I could hear that man begging, "Warren, please." And Warren just kept screaming, and he kept hitting him, and hitting him. And I was so afraid, I couldn't even get out of the truck and I just sat there, scrunched down in the front of the truck. But I could hear him. And Warren came back to the truck and he grabbed me by the shirt. And that's where I got all of that blood all over me. I'm afraid of him. I've always been so afraid of him. He's made me do terrible things. He told me that if I said anything, he was gonna kill me. And if I told you and you told anybody, he was gonna kill you and Dede and Bobby. And that's why I threw the shirt away. - Oh, sweetheart. - That's why I've been lying to you. - Oh, my baby. (somber music) (sobbing) Oh, baby. (horse neighing) - Throw me one of those rags. Earth to Sharon. Rag? - Oh, yeah. Sorry, just thinking. - I noticed. - There you go. - Thanks. - If you stole a loaf of bread 'cause our kids were starving, think that would still be considered stealing? - Well, that's high school philosophy. Stealing is stealing. You can't redefine it for every new set of circumstances. - You don't understand Kenny's life. See, just because he's made a few mistakes, he's always the first one they suspect. - I understand. I'll do anything to help, you know that. But if Kenny's really innocent, he doesn't need our help, does he? - DA asked me to go into her office, give her some information. - You should cooperate with her. - Oh. Oh, yeah, help her build a case against Kenny. - Get Kenny to tell you what really happened. Then we can figure out what to do. - Kenny's already told me what really happened. Warren did it. - Sharon, a man was murdered. - Warren committed a crime and now, Kenny's getting blamed for it. - And you really believe that? That Kenny was just there, that he couldn't do anything to stop it? - Yes, I believe it. Of course, I believe it, I have to believe it. If I don't believe it, who will? When Danny left me, all he left us was a crummy old house and a stack full of unpaid bills. I sold the house, paid the bills, moved us up a notch. Hasn't been easy, though. - Sharon, why'd you call me? - What, do I have to have a reason? Thought we liked each other? - We do. We do. I just thought maybe it had something to do with the case. - I just, show you some pictures of Kenny. (laughing) Look at that, look at that. Oh, gosh, that wasn't easy, especially for Kenny. - He was on the wrestling team? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, for a while. You know the coach said he was particularly tough for a kid his size. - You bragging about me again, Ma? - Hi, sweetie. Donna Mulroney, this is my son Kenny. Kenny, this is Donna Mulroney. - Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you too. Ma, I wanted to talk to you for a couple seconds before I take off again. - You know what, I have to go anyway, really. So, thanks for the tea, Sharon and we still on for dinner tonight? - Sure, yeah, absolutely, my treat. - [Donna] Great. - [Sharon] Bye bye. - Nice meeting you. I risked my life to protect you from Warren and you're having a class reunion with the district attorney? - I didn't say anything. Let me tell you something, I appreciate you protecting me, but I'll spend time with whoever I please. - Stay away from her. (breathing deeply) - Bill and I always talk about buying a place away from the city in a setting like this. You know, getting away from the rat race. - So why don't you? - Oh, I don't know. But it is certainly beautiful here. - Things aren't always the way they seem. Donna, please leave Kenny alone. - You know I can't do that, Sharon. I'm gonna have to talk to him sooner or later. - But it was Warren. - How do you know that? - What difference does it make? It's true. - Well, then Kenny's an accessory and I can only protect him so far. On the basis of this alone, I'm gonna have to take action. - But it's not fair if he has to be punished for something Warren did. - But he was there. Don't bury your head in the sand. He's an accessory to murder. It's gonna go hard on him. Look, I'll do what I can but there's no guarantee. - You see, this is just what I was talking about. Warren forced Kenny into this and then he threatened to kill him and then he threatened to kill all of us. Kenny was only trying to protect us. - Well, if that's the truth, then we need to find it out if you wanna help Kenny. Do you know where Warren Stubbs is? - No. - Donna, you can't use any of this. If you do, Kenny will know I told you. - I'm sorry, I have to. I don't have to tell anyone what you said here, not yet. But I have every right to pick Stubbs up. As well as Kenny. (lively music) (people chattering) - Well, well, well, if it isn't Warren Stubbs and his boy Kenny. So when'd they let you all out? - Don't tell me that was you playing. - Yeah, I got a new guitar. What do you think? See, somebody busted up my guitar in prison. Used it for firewood. - Nigger music, I never did much care for it. Say did they ever find out who started that fire? - You know damn well who started that fire, Warren. Spent eight months making that guitar. Kenny, you're out of jail now. You don't have to hang around with this Neanderthal anymore. - Look, don't start any trouble that you don't wanna finish. - And I'm real sorry to have to do this to you, Kenny. But I gotta admit, it's real nice to do it to you. Hey, Gordon. (punches thudding) Get those white Joes off my bar and don't be nice about it! (people murmuring) Told you I'd take care of 'em. Come on. Tired of dealing with all that, okay? Just me and you, baby, 'cause I love you. Hey! (thuds) (grunts) Run away. (thudding) (grunting) (clattering) (thudding) (grunting) (tense music) (Tony coughing) - That's enough. - We're not finished yet. - Leave him, Kenny. - I said we're not finished yet. (coughing) You see, Tony here has the wrong idea about some things. You see, he blames you for those fires that wrecked his guitar. It's not fair to blame you for something that you didn't do. Is it, Warren? - Oh geez, leave him alone, man. - You know what's under here, Warren? Tendons. - Come on, let's don't do this, please, man. His girlfriend's probably getting the cops. - Like little rubber bands. You see everybody forgets about the tendons. They always talk about the muscles. But muscles can be fixed. When you cut the tendons, you may as well cut the whole hand off. It will never play the guitar again. - Oh god, no! - [Warren] Kenny, come on. (bottle shatters) - No, no, no. (screaming) - Now, that's music. (Tony crying) - Kenny, that is stupid, man. I mean, aren't we in enough trouble already? I mean come on, I busted his nose, I think that's enough. - You think? You don't have enough brains to think. I've been thinking for the both of us since we met. - You're crazy, man. - We're finished. I'm through with you. - What're you talking about, Kenny? What am I supposed to do? - What am I supposed to do? (siren wailing) - Oh, come on, Kenny. - Don't call me. Don't think about me. Don't say my name. - Wait a minute, man. - [Kenny] Termite. - All right, let's see what you got. Let's see if you're rusty. (Kenny grunts) - [Kenny] Aw! - [Bobby] Ah, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat! - Oh! - Oh, that is bad! That is bad. - Look. (whistling) - Ouch! - Ooh! - Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! - Oh, can you steal it from me? Oh, no, oh, little brother. Back, back, back. (people chattering) - [Mark] Hi, honey. Sorry I'm late getting back but I see you aren't home from Millie's yet either. Reason I'm late, I stopped to help a couple of young guys and their mom near Clayton Ridge. Well, I'll see you later. - It wasn't me, it was Kenny! - [Mark] Bye. (recorder beeps) - I mean everyone's always blaming me but hey, he's crazy. - I wanna know what happened to Mark Willis. - I wanted to rob him. I pulled his own gun on him, okay? I wanted that truck. Hell, I admit that. Yeah, I was gonna let him go. But Kenny, no, he had to go berserk, you know, he shoots him and then bashes his head in. You don't believe me. (laughing) And then he leaves the truck. He didn't even want it. I tell you, the guy's psycho! Ask Tony Charin, he'll tell you. He knows the truth about Kenny now. He'll tell. I hit him but it was Kenny that cut his hand. I mean you ask him, he'll tell you. - You waiting for an engraved invitation? - I don't feel like going to school. I think I'll skip today. Maybe I can go down to the boats with you and help you. We could hang out. - Get your ass on that bus, now. What are you looking at me like that for? - I'm looking at you any way. - Hey, well, I'm sorry if I scared the hell out of him but one of me in this family's enough. - I didn't say anything. Anyway, I think that you're right. Do you want some breakfast or something? - You scared of me? - No. - Dede, I'm like a dog. I can smell fear. - I told you, I'm not afraid of you. (tense music) - I know that having a brother like me has not been easy. That's all different now, okay? Now, I only get on his case because he's a kid and he still has a chance not to make the same mistakes that I made. I'm doing it 'cause I love him. Just like I love you, hm? - I know. - Hey, Kenny. Can I talk to you a second? (tense music) Ken, oh! (tires screeching) (siren wailing) (grunts) (thudding) (thudding) - I didn't do anything! - [Harley] You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You also have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one, one will be provided for you. (somber music) - So, you believe he's guilty, don't you? - It's not up to me. - Could you just answer my question? Don't try to protect me or help me. - Kenny may not have pulled the trigger and he may not have hit Willis with that tire iron but he was there. God knows what they were like in prison. - Kenny and Warren were nothing alike. I mean Kenny tried to stop Warren. - Sharon, take the blinders off. Stop seeing him as your son and see him for what he is. Your son was involved in a murder. - Maybe. We don't know that for sure. At least I'm not absolutely sure enough that I can turn my back on him and walk away. He's my firstborn child. - Sharon- - [Sharon] What, don't you even understand? - It's what you wanna believe. - What if it's all true? What if Kenny's telling the truth and we send him back to prison, not because we don't have a reasonable doubt, but because we're not absolutely sure? - No, Sharon, you're not sure. - And you're all playing judge and jury. - I wanna be on your side but being on your side doesn't mean helping you hide from the truth. - Wait, wait, Ian, where are you going? - [Ian] I think it'd be better for both of us if I went home. - Better for both of us? Who's hiding from the truth now? - I want to stand with you. But I can't make everything disappear just 'cause you want me to. There are some things we can't change. I love you, Sharon. I wanna be with you. I wanna help. - If you're gonna leave, you better go on. - Nothing's changed, Skip. I don't understand. - There's way too much heat on you and your family right now. - It's my brother, it has nothing to do with me. - Sorry, Dede, it's nothing personal. My parents, you understand? See you later. - [Donna] Hi. - Hi. - Do you feel like taking a ride? - No. I don't wanna go. - I think you should. This is where it happened. And those are from the crime scene. I want you to look at them. You're gonna hear it all in court, Sharon. I'm just trying to help you. (tense music) - You're trying to use me to put my son on death row. - If you really believe that, I'll take you home right now. Warren must've found Willis's gun. .38 Special. Kept under the seat for protection. After they left you, they drove around, eventually, ending up here as the morning sun was coming up. Can't really say when the beatings began but we know he was worked over pretty good before arriving here. There was a lot of blood in the car. (tense music) He was chased down like an animal before he was shot in the leg- (gunshot bangs) just to bring him down, so the game could continue. Then somebody hit him with a tire iron. Not just once. Over and over and over. It's almost as if the fear and the pain kept him alive. The coroner said it took him almost 10 minutes to die. - Think his wife would see me? I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. - I don't know. I can ask her. I'll take you. - I need to go alone. Would you get me out of here? - If you don't like the coffee cake, we have lots of cookies. I've been baking a lot lately. I don't know why. Everyone that comes over brings something. Guess I just like the smell of baking in the house. Do you bake? - Not much. - You're staring at me. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - That's okay, I know why. That woman from the DA's office was shocked I agreed to this meeting. - Mrs. Willis, I'd like to tell you that I'm really very grateful that you did agree to meet with me. - Mark used to sit here for hours listening to his CDs. He loved music. It's funny, it's what I can't get used to, the quiet. It's all we ever wanted, peace and quiet. We came up here for quiet. Now, I can't stand it. - You know, all I wanted to do was come up here and tell you how sorry I am. (somber music) Well, now I'm here and I can't find the words to express. Kenny- - Please, don't talk about him. I'm glad that you came and I can see that Mark's death has hurt you too. But please don't mention your son. I don't think I could stand that. (phone ringing) Excuse me. Hello? Oh, hi, Stan. Yes, yes, I know. Thank you so much for calling. No, I'm holding up. You know how much he enjoyed those fishing trips together with you. He was always bragging about those big trout. (phone ringing) - Yeah? - Sorry to bother you. I had no idea you'd be working so late. I guess we both know what's keeping you so busy. - What's the matter, Sharon? - He's going to prison for the rest of his life, isn't he? Feel like my whole world's falling apart. - Stay right there, I'll be right over. - No, no. You don't have to do that. - No, I want to, okay? Just stay put, all right? Oh, and could you put on a pot of coffee? Thanks. You want a cup? - Yeah, might as well. Gonna be up all night anyway. God, I must be a lousy mother. - That's crap. You loved your kids, you did the best you knew how. - Hey, look, don't patronize me, okay? This is the second time my son's been in prison. What does that say about me? What does it say about me as a mom? What didn't I give him as a mother? - Let me tell you something. I see a lot of parents with troubled kids in my work. It isn't always the parents' fault. - Well, if that's true about Kenny, I wanna know where the hell I was all those years! - Go talk to him, Sharon. And look at him when he talks to you. Really look. You'll know if you want to know whether or not he's telling the truth. (sighs) - What did you think was gonna happen to me? I'm in prison again. What did you think was gonna happen to me? - [Sharon] Kenny. - I don't wanna talk about it. And don't tell Bobby. He's already freaking out about it. - Have you talked to your lawyer? Do you like him? - Her, since we couldn't cough up enough cash, I get the best public defender money couldn't buy. - I'll borrow money then. I'll get a better lawyer. Ian will help. - He hasn't left you yet since he found out you have such a rotten kid? - [Sharon] Kenny. - Hey, don't worry. You know what a good job the public defender did for me the last time. I mean, heck, this broad passed her bar exam on the fourth try. What do I got to worry about? - All right, Kenny, Kenny, come here. Kenny, come here, come here. You have to tell me everything that happened. Maybe we can prove that Warren did it all. You had nothing to do with it. You were just there. - You expect people to believe me? - I expect them to believe me. - Good luck. - [Sharon] Please. - No. - Kenny, this is the last time I'm gonna ask you. (tense music) - Willis had a gun in his truck. Warren saw it and he took it. Then he went off to get gas, I took a walk up there just to say thank you and good night. And Warren was holding that gun on him. I got in there just to try to calm Warren down. Sometimes, I can do that, but not this time. He was mad. He was real mad. He was mad at your boyfriend for treating him like dirt. You didn't know about that, did you? Yeah, he did, it's true, I saw him. Anyway, Warren was going on about how much money this guy had and I figured we were just gonna take his truck, make him walk home. But as he started to walk away, Warren shot at him. And he just kept on running and Warren kept shooting at him. But he couldn't kill him. So Warren starts to play with him. There was this little trickle of blood coming down from his nose, and he was saying, "no," and "why?" And Warren just keeps beating him. (melancholic music) And then he pulls over and he gets the tire iron. Well, you could see it in his eyes. He knew what was coming. His eyes were so wide open with fear. Mumbling, babbling some pathetic... And Warren smashes his head. And you could feel his skull crack again, and again. You gotta get me out of here. All right, you listen to me. You gotta get me out of this. This is your fault. It was your fault that I was set up in the first place. Mom! Where you? Where the hell are you going? Mom! (somber music) (sighs) Hey, Mom. Are you back so soon? What, you want me to tell you the story all over again? How many times you gotta hear it? When are you just gonna believe me? You're my mother. You're supposed to believe me. What the hell? (gunshot bangs) (breathing deeply) - [Dede] Mom? What are you doing? Did you sleep out here all night? - Yeah, I guess I must've dosed off. What time is it? - Like seven. - Hey, Dede, Dede, wait, wait, wait, wait! Where you going? - To study. - You think maybe you could stay around here, you know, have your friends come over here to study? - I don't have friends anymore. (somber music) - What're you talking about? - You think you're the only one that's having a hard time? Did you ever think that maybe I might be having a hard time too? Oh, don't worry about Dede just so long as Bobby's fed and the laundry's done. - Dede, sweetie, I'm sorry, I didn't. - I'm all grown up now and I don't ever remember being a kid, you know? Do you ever think about that? I didn't think so. - Dede, I'm sorry. - You came to see me? - No, I was just passing by and I stopped to sit down for a minute. - Sharon, I've been watching you from my window. You came to see me. Why? - It was nothing. - You didn't come all the way down here for nothing. - I made a mistake, I gotta go. - Hey, hey, I know you saw Kenny yesterday. You know something. - I can't talk to you about this. - He did it, didn't he? Kenny killed Mark Willis. - No. - Sharon, I've never lied to you and you've never lied to me. Don't start now. He murdered that man. Kenny, not Warren. - No. - He made Connie Willis a widow, he destroyed those lives. It was him, wasn't it? - No! Oh, god. I brought a monster into the world. - Sharon, people like Kenny don't just happen. He's beyond what a mother can do. - I could've done something. - No. - Donna, what do I do now? - You have to testify. - No, I can't. No matter what he's done. I have to protect him, I'm his mother. - You know where to find me. (somber music) (sobbing) - God, no. No! No! - [Donna] Your Honor, the state calls Sharon Carlson. - [Bailiff] Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - Your Honor, I'd like permission to treat this witness as a hostile witness. Ms. Carlson, I will spare you the difficulty of repeating the events of the night in question. It's already been established that your son and Warren Stubbs were present at the time of death. I'm only gonna ask you one question. Do you know which one killed Mark Willis? - Ms. Carlson. - I remind you of a conversation you and I had three days ago in the courtyard of this building. Do you recall that conversation? - Yes. - Look at your son, Ms. Carlson. - I can't. - Why not? Is it because you know he killed Mark Willis? Is it because you know he shot Mark Willis and when that wasn't enough, took a tire iron and beat him to death? Ms. Carlson, under oath, do you know whether or not your son killed Mark Willis? - Yes. - And how do you know that? - Because I found a shirt. It was a plaid shirt he had it on that night. And it was covered with blood. He told me he was nowhere near the murder. He told me he was frightened and he hid so that Warren couldn't hear him. And that the blood got on his shirt from Warren's hands. I knew that couldn't have been true because, well, I guess I just waited too long to believe it. I waited too long to listen. - Is that why you can't look at him? - I can't look at him because when I do, I don't see my son. (somber music) - Your Honor, at this time, the prosecution requests a recess so that we can obtain the evidence in question and have it fully examined. - Thank you. (melancholic music) Hey, Dede. Well, you try some. Dede, you want? (knocking on door) - Is there enough for one more? - If it's you. - No, no. I'll get it. (melancholic music) (lively fanfare music)
