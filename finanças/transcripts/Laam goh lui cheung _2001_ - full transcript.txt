I don't have that much, take half! Alright. You bastard! You didn't keep your word aftertaking my money! You gave me half the price, and I told only half the story. Am I professional enough? As for another half of your story... King Wong's speaking. Hold on a second... Everyone, my moment is about to come. You may speak. Mr. Wong, We're calling from The King of Karaoke Contest, you've broken ourtable ten glasses..., ...and ourtiles. When you were interviewed last time. And the total is... Oh, you've also taken half dozen of beers. The total is $3,700. Money is not the issue here. I wanna know when is the final competition because I need to arrange my schedule. Ourfinal competition is on September 2. But it's none of your business because you aren't in. Do you expect me to pay if I'm not in? What kind of service is that? This is The good is paid back for their good deeds. An innocent young man almost falls into the trap. 2 glasses and... ...some beers have tested out their integrity. This world is fair. Go, go to Macau. Alright, 7 p.m. 7p.m.? Now is much cheaper. Let's go! Is that cheaper now? Yes, let's go! Don't you have to work? Go! What kind of leisure have you got, going out in your working hours? Alright, I'll follow the procedures and apply for a half-day leave. And I invite you to come along. Permission is not granted! Unreasonable suppression! I'm on a strike! If you step out this door, you are fired! I'm on fire! Bye-bye! I'm serious! Have you gone to Macau? I wanna ask you something. Say it, quick! I really bought the tickets! I'm in! That's proves how dishonest the entertainment industry is! Do you know why I got in? Of course, I was there too. Those judges must be either deaf or blind. I'm not discriminating the disables but the judges are real retards! Do you recall one of the judges, the woman with a big mouth? I knew her. We get along well. I knew that your song was a copy. I'm dedicating this song forthe birthday of boy Tim. Wait... Is that Waiting for you? I don't care, I'm telling you... What's up? Wait... Yourfriend... Sing! Go home! Do you sing? Go home! Alright! This is the real kind of singing. She lets me in because she wants... ...to embarrass me forthe second time! But I don't want to be embarrassed anymore! Right, this is the right kind of attitude! You cannot lose your dignity. Withdraw your application, then! Wouldn't that turns out to be a bigger joke? It's okay. You've guts. You can do whatever you want. Why don't you train me? Make me a confident individual who can perform in front of others. We're all adults and civilized, right? We are not in any kind of relationships. And surely, that won't happen, right? If you want my help, that's gonna cost you. How much? $300 or $3000? Debts from 3 credit cards. 3 credit cards? Too expensive? Give me a reason. Why do I have to help you? I'm fragile... I don't have friends. Everyone in the company makes me an invisible. I feel like I'm all alone and useless. Bye-bye! If you don't teach me, I'll learn by myself! Start! I don't feel well today. That's it. You can't learn everything by yourself! Debts from 3 credit cards is the tuition fee. Not everyone can give you such kind of lesson... Stephen! What are you coming back for? Work, I'm prompt today. You were fired yesterday. Your suit is as good as the one you wore yesterday! 22-inches waist. No more kidding. You were fired yesterday! I know what I should do. Do you remember Auntie? The one who makes you ginseng chicken soup! The one who asks you to take care of his son! I now beg you in the name of your Auntie. I beg you not to beg me. I'm fired too. No more kidding! I'm fired, just like you. We love the company and the company loves us. Look how much you all care about me! This is not the silent tribute but silent support. Is Mr. King Wong here? Even outsiders are giving me the silent support. Who are you looking for? Mr. Wong. We've an invoice for him. I want to check it with him. What's this all about? They're after my debts. They don't look like it. They look pretty civilized. If they're civilized when they're in suit, all girls must be pretty if they work in beauty salons! Give me some money! Give it to you? Hush down, would you? Can you borrow me then? Give me a reason. Why do I have to help you? Please don't play tricks on me! What? Alright, can we help each other out? I guarantee you after my training, you'll be able to sing in front of 20,000 people in the stadium. Really? Really. How much? $8000. You owe them $8000? You can borrow it from the colleagues. I know but I owe them all now. Owing only a couple of thousands... If I don't have the new card, how can I pay off the old cards' debt? Who on earth don't have debts? I never owe anyone or anything. You're not from the earth. But I've faith in you. If you join the contest, you will surely win. After you won, we'll split the prize. Why? I'm now a socialite. A socialite is teaching you! Who doesn't know me, King Wong? Miss, do you know who I am? King Wong. I didn't cheat you, did I? And so? 30%. I hate bargaining with women. 35%. Deal! When does the training start? When we perform... especially the beginners, they've to stand in front of the crowd. 5 reactions from the crowd: Yell, cheer down, degrade, tease, critilize. But we should remain devoted, like listening to ourfavorite songs. Go overthat side... and tell me what they're singing. What's it? What do they say? It's too vulgar. I can't say it. Don't say the exact words but tell me the content. What's new? Going or not? That's very vulgar. That's it! Big improvement. It's alright so far. Look at me. What're you doing? Staring? When we perform, the audience love this... Having some guts. You look right into them when you're up the stage. They'll think that you've guts. And even if you sing sucks, they'll assume that you're good. Even if you look terrible, they'll think that you're awesome. And in this case, you're of course... Iovely at all times. Ice tea. You ordered iced tea, sir. Sir, did you order ice tea? Anything else, sir? Sorry sir, I took a look at your girlfriend. I'll buy you the iced tea. Sorry. If I'm in good shape, I could stare in return of a free dinner. Look at me and stare. Concentrate! Right, use up your energy even there's none. Think about coffee, tea, and curry beef. Look at that side. Now, walk over. Stare until you get the toast forfree. Toast is hard; can I go forthe glass of water instead? I only have the coke in return. Don't worry, you've bet on all horses. Miss, I don't know you. No, be more concentrate! Energy! Energy! Let go the stock! All of them! Right, Round 4, No.7! Miss, are your eyes alright? I can introduce you a doctor! Am I good enough? I can even get a doctor in return! Don't loosen up! Face the crowd and be more concentrate! This... Damn it! Can't you cede the old ones? You bitch! I get in the wrong way. You're so brutal! Good, don't be proud, look at that side! Thanks. Take the umbrella then! Thanks. I live in the west of Tin Shui Wai. And it's raining again tonight. I think it's betterto take a cab. As an respectful apprentice, You'll have to help. Money again? Look at me and say it out loud! You want money again? Good! I've put in some effort... ...in strengthening you after all. It'll be deducted next time. $200? Take the bus! What's up? Shit, all your energy is gone! You need more overtime! At night, most people are more fragile than usual. If you can conquerthe night, we're closerto our goal. Alright, forthe sake of ourtraining, moving around is nothing. That's it. My landlord knows that I've to train you at night and he dissents. That's why I didn't pay my rent. And consequently, he kicks me out. Basically, I gave up the house for you. But I didn't care less. Forthe sake of training... rest more. Didn't you say we've to do the overtime training? Yeah and you did strengthen your guts tonight since you let me in in the middle of the night. You've some guts and that's a big improvement. Take a rest... 1 ' 2 ' 1 My landlord knows that I've to train you in the tuition fee too? No, that'll be deducted when you get the prize. Here is hot! I'm almost burned; you can eat me now! If you don't have money forthe air-condition, why bother renting a house? I didn't rent it; I bought it. I think it's cool here and that's why I bought it. I feel it. I'm going to work. Don't touch anything. Go on, go to work! I don't touch others' stuff. So much letters, are these love letters? No way, how could that be? What is this? A suck will give you a longer life span? Do you think it works? What can you do? What are you doing? Seducing me? English novels, wanna-be intellect! Nothing interesting. What is it in there? Denny Chan. Denny Chan and... Pile of trash! What good stuff does it have? Favorite Greatest Hits? Show time! Leaving your love one with a kiss. Louder, baby! A wrong decision only gives me a life-long sadness. Why do you do this? If you knew it's heart-breaking? Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Are you alright? Did we do anything upset you? So sorry. Sorry... Nothing, get back to work! You whole life fills with tragedies. King Wong's speaking, you don't have to suspect. I'm not in your room. Suspecting won't help; it only wears me out. Success! They no longertreat me as the invisible! They're now respectful, no... They respect me yet scared of me. Of course, it's all due to my training. Talk to me when you're back. You tape it over? You're doomed. You recorded over my tape? You're surely dead. Good, scary eyes. You win... Your air-condition and electricity will be deduced in the tuition fee. You're too much. Yes, deduct it from the prize. What're we training today? Oh please, go and practice! Playing such way will get you no wife! I'm asking you what is ourtraining today? It's finished... We'll start it now! Look at these No.7. Use the most vulgar language to enlighten them. The most vulgar language? Bastard! Yelling takes a lot of curses and poison. Use the worst kind of poison. Stupid pancake! Is that too mean? Good enough? You graduated. Already? Get some rest, go! You go home for your wife! You hear me or not? Getting married will not get you anywhere. Shitty players! What's wrong again? Go! Where? Go to Karaoke and practice! Karaoke? You think I'm some idiots or what? If I go there, I'll probably end up paying your bills. Don't waste my time! I'm not cheating you. Alright, let's do it here! Do you have any music? Any instruments? Just give me anything and I'll play the melody. Anything! Any instrument, right? Lute? With strings, what's so difficult about it? Prince is in the shower... What're you up to now? Wrong key... This string is no good. God knows how long you've kept it. It's... It's all yourfault. You trap me here all night. Going to Karaoke with you is the worst case. It's all yourfault. Chicken is a fault. I've told you. It's all yourfault. Saving is a fault. Don't you say you know me at all. How would my reputation... got ruined in your hands. If you're not confident in singing, don't blame me fortaking your advantages. My motto goes, If you want it, do it. It has never been too much. If you aren't good looking and hot, please don't come to me at all. In fact, you aren't that chicken, going there all alone. You can too. Me? Good morning. Take a break. No training today. It's okay.

No. After she was rejected, she was very calm. That's good. That's good. She was calm. No wonder your name is idiot! When those desperate women fail, they usually commit suicide. They all look calm before they commit suicide. Psychologically, this is a kind a mental reflex. And the exact term is mental reflex syndrome. Have you heard of it? I know, the mental reflex syndrome. Don't look at me in this way! I'm not your... I help her because she is preparing for the contest. She got in and that's why I help her. If she wins, I'll have my cash prize. I didn't ask you.
