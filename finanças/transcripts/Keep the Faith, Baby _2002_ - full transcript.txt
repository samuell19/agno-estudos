Captioning sponsored by PARAMOUNT PICTURES ( women sobbing ) REPORTER: Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Harlem's controversial preacher politician, was laid to rest today after a well-attended ceremony at his own Abyssinian Baptist Church. As chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Congressman Powell, a charismatic, self-styled activist, became the most powerful black elected official in United States history. He was 63 years old. ( church bell tolls ) SCHILLER: I never finished the story while Powell was alive because it was too easy to get wrong. The man was complex. Now that he was dead, I sure as hell didn't want to mess it up. His enemies would love it. Mr. Speaker. SPEAKER McCORMACK: For what purpose does the gentleman from California rise? Mr. Speaker, it is upon my responsibility as a Member Elect of the 90th Congress that I make a motion that the gentleman from New York, Mr. Powell, not be sworn in at this time as a member of this Congress. Does the gentleman demand that the gentleman from New York step aside? Yes, Mr. Speaker, and I further move that a special bipartisan committee be appointed to determine ultimately how Mr. Powell should be dealt with. This committee should report its findings back within five weeks in order that we, at that time, can, uh, find a more permanent solution to the Powell matter. SCHILLER: Adam, Adam, Adam. We both know a measly little newspaper article-- even if it is the front page-- doesn't come close, man. Impossible, but I had to try. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., of New York, is excluded from his seat in this house... ( light applause ) ...until such time as the bipartisan subcommittee delivers its report. ( gavel pounding ) The sons of bitches. They really did it. Congress threw away the Constitution to railroad Adam Clayton Powell today. I had too much power for a Negro. ( reporters clamoring ) First they stole away the Education and Labor Committee Chairmanship I worked fair and hard to get, and gave it to Carl Perkins of Kentucky. Then, to underline their contempt for me and the people who voted me into Congress, they kicked me out of Congress itself. With this whole thing, we're going to say it just like it is. Any Congressman with a conscience won't be sleeping well tonight. ( congregation laughs ) They say it's a question of character and ethics. They say your congressman, your pastor, lacks in both. MAN: That's not true! That's what my distinguished colleagues say about me. They say it's my absenteeism, relatives on the payroll and the way that I flaunt the use of public funds to travel first-class, some of it for pleasure. Of course I have pleasure when I travel. And of course I travel first class, baby. They do. My esteemed colleagues say I gall the American people. Do I gall y'all? MAN: No. That I gall the people. That's like the sheet calling the pillowcase white. Amen! The people, not Congress, decides who represents them. Nowhere in the Constitution that I read does it stipulate that the House of Representatives has the right to dictate who represents the people of Harlem. Why, if it was up to those hypocrites I never would have been elected in the first place. Well, they would have excluded me long ago when I first introduced the Powell Amendment. They would have excluded me for holding their feet to the fire to provide the type of leadership and representation provided for us in the great document the Constitution of the United States of America. What sort of leadership do we have in this country when there are people who have fought and died for this country that there are still places that we can't go and sit down and order a cup of coffee in a cheap little lunch counter?! If these men, our leaders, can't lead us to a better nation, can't themselves provide the type of democracy that they are preaching, then all of them, each and every one, should just sit down and shut up! WOMAN: Congressman, you can't just go... I want my seat back, baby. MCCORMACK: Adam, we-we were just discussing you. Please join us. MAN: Congressman. MCCORMICK: Uh, Manny Cellar here is chairman of the committee to evaluate the charges against you. John Conyers, a friend. He'll be on it. I was elected by the people of Harlem to be their representative in Congress. I fit all the criteria in the Constitution to be their congressman. My colleagues can't just kick me out because they don't like the truth I speak or the way I speak it. You're not being kicked out, Adam. You're being temporarily excluded, pending the findings of the investigation. Don't patronize me, Mr. McCormack. I want my seat back. I'm right. And in the end, I'll be proven right, I guarantee it. Good to see another black face in the Congress Mr. Conyers. Keep the faith, baby. SCHILLER: It was, uh, June 8, 1969, when I landed in Bimini. Adam went down there so often they called it Adam's Island. I had done all my research, and as a result of which, I had absolutely no idea what manner of man I was going to encounter. Everybody had a different story. The only consistent thing was that Adam Clayton Powell was smart, slick and liked the finer things in life. Damn. Congressman Watson from South Carolina said Adam Powell lived down here in paradise with a drink in one hand and a woman in the other. I don't know what they consider paradise in South Carolina, but where I come from, this is a raggedy-ass shack. And maybe I took the wrong road. Mr. Powell? Adam Clayton Powell? Congressman Powell? Hello? ( typing ) Door wide open. Scotch laid out on the table with three glasses. I figured Powell knew I was coming and he wanted me to feel comfortable... make myself at home. So I did. But I learned, like so many others, never assume anything with Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Mister, what are you doing in my house? Drinking my liquor? Reading my books? I'm a reporter, Congressman Powell. For The Defender. Joe Schiller? We exchanged letters. Did I tell you you could take over my house? Having a drink after working my way through your jungle trying to find this place hardly constitutes taking over your house. But if I offended you I apologize. You sound pretty damn proper. An educated Negro. Relax, man. What did you say your name was? Schiller. Joe Schiller. I hear you're... working on a book about your colleagues in Congress. You mean the textbook I'm working on? General information. I hear it's information about who's done what and to whom. Sounds like a get-even book to me. I'd have to go backward to get even. My intentions are merely to provide insight to the population on how their representatives do the business of government. Want to help me clean these fish, Mr. Schiller? Not really. Then you don't get to eat. You sure you've never done this before? Positive. Would've never known. If I wasn't starving from trying to find this place I wouldn't be doing it now. What kind of story are you after, Mr. Schiller? I just want to know what's true and what isn't. You know... who you are. A lot of that depends on who you are wouldn't you say? Do you mind if we go back to your formative years when you were an activist? I still am. Well, I know that as a young man, you... Well, young is relative, Mr. Schiller. A state of mind. Well, when you were younger in years, you organized protests and boycotts in New York to get black folks jobs. That was more as a religious leader, right? There's no separation of church and state in the black community, Mr. Schiller. You should know that, brother. Well, then, what caused you to leave the pulpit and go into politics? I never left. I'm still a pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church. ♪ Drop me off in Harlem ♪ ♪ Anyplace in Harlem ♪ ♪ There's someone waiting there ♪ ♪ Who makes it seem like heaven... ♪ ♪ Up in Harlem... ♪ No rent, no room! All right, that's it! Break it down! I want him out! I want him out! Ease up, baby. No need to go breaking down people's doors, now. I'm Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Jr. I'd like a word in private with Mr. O'Malley. Mr. O'Malley? Unless you got my money, Powell we got nothing to talk about. I got eviction papers here. I do have your bread, daddy. I think you want to talk to me. Give me the money first. Uh-uh, baby. Talk. You've been making out like a fat rat in a cheese factory, my man. We need to discuss that. Just give me my money, Powell. I don't want to talk. Oh, that's no way to negotiate, daddy-o. Be cool or all rent will stop. That means no money. Zero. You can't do that. I've done it all over Harlem. And your colleagues have discovered that it's good business to do business with me. Here's the deal: you get half the rent until you've delivered on the list of repairs that need to be done in this building. Meanwhile, we'll negotiate fair rents across the board. It's your best bet, Big O. And God will look kindly on you, too. Let's go. Mr. O'Malley, one more thing: The first thing on your list... fix Shackelford's door. O'MALLEY: Let's get out of here! ( crowd murmuring ) MAN: God bless you, Reverend Powell. Thank you, Reverend. WOMAN: Thank you, Reverend Powell! WOMAN 2: I'll see you Sunday, Reverend! MAN 2: Amen! I saved your hide, Shack. I expect to see you in church this Sunday so we can work on your soul. Yes, sir, Reverend Powell. I'll be in church Sunday. Definitely. And bring the family. Yes, sir. The rest of y'all colored folks in this building y'all come too, now. The Lord is our Shepherd, y'all.

Marvelous. Really marvelous. WOMAN: Amen! Good morning to you, members of Abyssinian. CONGREGATION: Good morning. I said "Good morning!" CONGREGATION: Good morning! Ah... ( laughing ) Good people of Abyssinian, every time I look around this beautiful church and see the beautiful people, I am compelled to have to bring to the attention of people who are newcomers, the chief reason that we are here in this beautiful structure, and that is primarily through the efforts of my father Adam Clayton Powell Sr... ( applause ) ...the loving devotion of his wife, my mother, Mattie Powell. ( applause ) And, of course, my lovely wife, as well-- Isabel. Please stand up. ( applause ) And, of course, through the efforts of all of you. Brothers and sisters, we have with us today very distinguished guests, members of New York City's political hierarchy. Powerful men who make things happen. We have our fine mayor, and former Congressman, Fiorello La Guardia the "Little Flower." Please stand, Mr. Mayor. No, I said, "Please stand, Mr. Mayor." All of his political associates-- these distinguished gentlemen who have come down. ( applause continues ) Brothers and sisters, today we're going to have a... "Sunday, come to meeting." It is Sunday, and you have come to meeting. ( chuckling ) My father always taught me, he always taught me to preach with all your heart, your mind and your soul the old-time simple gospel. That's right. That's right. Given the fact that we have the powerful men who do make things happen in this city... we're going to use as our text Matthew 23, verse 21. ( congregation agreeing ) It says, "Render therefore to Caesar "the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's." Brothers and sisters, our message today: "Sharing the Wealth." LA GUARDIA: Reverend Powell, I think the root of our problem is that you don't understand how government works. Well, perhaps if I came up there and joined the City Council, Mr. Mayor, I could learn. ( laughing ) No, no, no, no, no. Your place is right here in the community, in front of your people... on Sunday mornings... attending their spiritual needs. POLITICO: Besides... even if you got all the votes in Harlem, you still wouldn't have enough to make City Council. You'll need some white votes to win citywide. You deliver us the Negro votes that we need and we may find a little extra something... just for you. I appreciate this donation to my congregation but I, uh... I had something a little more equitable in mind. Arnold... Arnold, give this to Hattie, over at the church. Tell her it's a municipal contribution. ARNOLD: I'll do it now. Now, gentlemen, let's get down to the brass tacks. When I spoke of sharing the wealth, I meant in terms of jobs, opportunity, opening up the city to all the people. Frankie... Mm-hmm? Another round. I always find that scotch warms a conversation, don't you? To sharing the wealth. ( laughing ) So these three yachts I read about were actually a dinghy, a small motorboat and an old fishing boat that belonged to your father? You know how the press exaggerates. You're one of them. Basically, you're telling me it's all smoke and no fire. Now, brother, I didn't say all that. I go first-class every chance I get, just like my colleagues, only I refuse to be a sneak and a liar like them. So you don't mind admitting that you took money off the record, under the table, so to speak? Who'd you say you work for again, J. Edgar Hoover? No... Black Reporter. Black newspaper. Ultimately, I serve the same people you represented when you weren't down here fishing. POWELL: I've been serving the people since before you were born, Mr. Schiller. Sit down. Would you like an Irish whiskey? If you're joining me. Certainly. A lot of your people ride the city buses that my transport workers union is striking against. Mr. Quill... your union has a total workforce of 3,202 members. Only 14 are Negroes and all of them are low-end porters. I want drivers and mechanics. That'll take time. There's a seniority system that must be honored. I can't take that back uptown with me. Negro passengers pay the fares and all they see are white people in the drivers' seats? If that's all they're going to see after helping you attain your goals why the hell bother? I'm prepared to offer you apprentice situations as a start. When the older workers retire then the younger people will be capable of moving into their positions. Not good enough. If we help you get what you want we need to see Negroes in some of those drivers' seats. Let me think about it. I'll see what I can come up with. The bus company will meet your demands in no time if we can come to an agreement. I guarantee empty buses rolling through Harlem. I wish I had you working for me in my union, Mr. Powell. If I were in your union, Mr. Quill, you'd be working for me. ( laughing ) Well, then a fine battle we'd have on our hands, my friend. We'll have to be keeping an eye on that one. Weren't you the one who told me that any church that was inactive in the community was worthless? Will you quit using my words to fit your purposes? I said "active" not hooked up with a bunch of radical hoodlums attacking everything in sight. My radical hoodlums have gotten jobs for Negroes all over New York. Department stores, the electric company or phone company. Even those Negroes who've been talking behind my back. Will you two lower your voices? It took me years to build up my congregation. I did it by not leaving anyone behind. Negroes are basically conservative, son. At least the ones you can count on. You can't leave your base support behind and be running all up and down the streets acting wild and crazy. Our "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" campaign has gotten Negroes hired where their money was taken for granted. When the board agreed to let you take my place they trusted that you would continue things the way they were, and I thought you would, too. Well, it's a new age, Father P. Maybe it calls for new strategies. Hush, now, Adam. Listen to your father. FATHER: Son... I don't think it's a good idea for you to get all involved in white people's union problems. To be most effective, a Negro leader must be independent. I'll always stay independent, Father P. But in order to put out fires you got to deal with the people who own the water. And until I can get up in there that's white unions, white government, and white people. You can lead this church, or you can get involved in politics. But if you fight too many battles on too many fronts, you just may lose the war. POWELL: Let those hypocrites downtown know that we here at home... ( people shouting ) PEOPLE ( chanting ): Don't ride the buses! ( horn honking ) Miss Scott, I should have taken another route. Troublemakers. Oh, on the contrary, they're heroes. It's just too bad they don't know how to get out of the way so we won't be late this afternoon. Are we going to ride that lousy stinking, nasty bus?! PEOPLE ( chanting ): Don't ride the buses! Don't ride the buses! Don't ride the buses! Don't ride the buses! ( horn honking ) ( chanting continues ) Don't ride the buses! You see that, uh, well-dressed, nosy one? Obviously, Mr. Powell himself. Excuse me, uh... can we get through? You're Hazel Scott. It's a pleasure to meet you. And who are you? You don't know who I am? I'm the big bad wolf. Oh. Well, nice to meet you, Mr. Big Bad Wolf. Now, can you clear a path for us? Maybe I should detain you for a while. Make you picket with us proletariat for a minute or two. It'd be great for morale. Now, Mr. Wolf, you are not that big and bad. ( sighs ) Open up a path here! Open! Miss Hazel Scott is coming through. I have no problem picketing with my people, Mr. Big Bad Wolf. I just have to be somewhere this afternoon. The name's Adam Clayton Powell, Junior. I'll pretend like I believe you've never heard of me. Either way, I promise you'll be more aware of me in the future. ( all chanting ): Don't ride the buses! Open up! Open up a path! ( chanting continues ) Hold up, cats. Got to make sure you get my best side. ...beating the forces of New York City that did not want you to have control of your own lives and your own unions! ( crowd talking ) What? Let me hear you! Let them hear you downtown! Let them hear you uptown! Let them hear you all over this town! Powell for City Council! All right, y'all. Right there, baby. ( all chanting ): Powell for City Council! One more time. Amen, baby, amen. Do you remember when there were no Negro workers in those stores? I do solemnly swear to abide by the charter of the city of New York so help me God. It was so boring. Actually I couldn't believe that I was raised there. Could you? ( classical music playing ) ( applause ) ( starts playing classical music ) ( stops playing ) ( starts playing jazz ) ( audience murmurs in appreciation ) ( applause ) You know who I am yet? Hmm... ( chuckles ) New York's first Negro city councilman. Congratulations. I get your drink right? Shouldn't you be out kissing babies or at home with your wife? Something suitable for a city councilman. I belong to the people. Not being naughty now, are we? I'm trying to be nice. Who knows? Maybe I could, uh, win your vote. May I? Suit yourself. You know, we have a lot in common. Do we? We're both very interested in getting to know each other. You are a hoot and a scoundrel. Glad I made a good impression. ( chuckles ) Garçon, more champagne. MAN: Right away, Mr. Councilman. There really ought to be a warning label on men who belong to the people first. Some manage. A lot less than people care to admit. Your father did. My father wanted to be a congressman but he never got on the political boat like I did. He did his work through the church. So, you went beyond the church and the family and into politics because you felt the need to accomplish more than your father? And I did this because I was in competition with my father for the love of my mother. Make good copy. Domino. ( groans ) Thank you, my friend. You know how to play dominoes? Uh, no. Well, sit down, let me baptize you a little bit. Ferdinand, why don't you... you and Mike go over to the bar, belly up. My friend Joe's going to buy you a drink. In fact, Joe's buying drinks for everybody in the bar! Another round. ( cheers ) Look, um, you know, I don't work for the Times. Not yet, my friend, not yet. So, uh, when exactly did you decide you were going to go for the new congressional seat for Harlem? The minute I heard there might be a new congressional district created for Harlem. White people had been representing Harlem for too long. Or should I say they'd been taking Harlem for granted long enough. I couldn't think of a better man for the job. Most people figured A. Philip Randolph deserved it, and, uh, some say you stole it. If I remember correctly, I was voted into Congress by the people of Harlem. But you did know there was a big movement to draft A. Philip Randolph. I can think of no other man I respect more for his efforts in the same struggle as I as the man we honor tonight, Mr. A. Philip Randolph, founder and president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters! ( cheering and applause ) Find Reverend Powell and tell him. Have you got that? ( people talking in background ) The order's been changed. Ray Jones doesn't trust Powell to go first So, we got to find Powell before he goes on stage. Reverend Powell... Reverend Powell, sir. Is there a problem? There's been a slight change of plans. Instead of introducing Mr. Randolph we would like you to close the prayer. That means we'll throw away the speech I've been working on for the past two weeks. Whose bad idea is this anyway? Unless Mr. Randolph tells me personally that he wants things to go differently, I'm on next. But, sir... Ray Jones. Hello, Adam. Sure looks like they're ready for A. Philip tonight. Yes, it does. Better go warm up the stage for him, shall I? Wait a minute, Adam, I think there's been a change in the order. No, no, not at all. You know, we should work together sometime you and me. I like the way you think. And I have a feeling that history-- political history-- will be changed by some of the things that may be put in motion here tonight. ( cheering ) Well, wish me luck. ( band playing march ) ( talking in background ) ( cheering and applause ) A. Philip Randolph! ( cheering and whistling ) A. Philip Randolph, we welcome you. My City of New York. My kingdom of Harlem! ( cheering and stomping ) We have important business... to discuss tonight-- important business-- and I, your humble little parish priest will make sure that that business is done correctly. I shall try to keep my remarks down... but nonetheless, I shall try to make them like a woman's skirt-- long enough to be respectable, but short enough to be interesting. ( laughing ) Many people may wonder why from time to time we must come together as a Negro people at events such as these to protest the unfair treatment that is being heaped upon Negroes throughout this country and throughout the world... ( cheering ) ...but I say the protest has a purpose. I say there are measurable gains to be made when a person says, "Get off of my neck." I say it's because we protested that we Negro people in New York have the first Negro councilman in City Hall. ( crowd roaring ) It is because we protested that we desegregated all the stores on 125th Street in Harlem... but it is now time for the first Negro congressman from New York. ( cheering and whistling ) Therefore... I must... in spite of time, energy and prior commitments... I must run for the Congress of the United States of America... ( cheering and stomping ) ( cheering and stomping continue ) ...so that we, Harlem, may have a national voice speaking from your national capital! ( cheering ) "Why the Negro?" many of you will ask. I, Adam Powell, am in a position to answer that because I, Adam Powell, may belong to a group of people that some others may think are inferior but I belong to a group of people that God-- omniscient, omnipresent God, God of all power-- says, "You're my children, and you're the same as anyone else," and with that kind of faith in me and courage in me I know I can be as good, if not better than anyone who walks the halls of Congress. ( roaring ) Doesn't matter what ticket or what party-- my people demand a forthright, militant, anti-Uncle Tom congressman! ( crowd roaring ) My cry today and until the day I die is, "Let my people go, now!" ( cheering and whistling ) ( piano playing ) What do you want, Mr. Powell? A better world for all. And where, may I ask, do you think I fit in? I don't know yet. ( piano notes clunk ) ( chuckles ) Your wife must have the commitment of Job. She knows who I am. Does she? Really? Some people know me, Miss Scott. Would you like to? Depends on what kind of student you are. A very good student, Miss Scott. How good of a teacher are you? I'm a very good teacher. Prove it to me. Well, let's start with, uh, some "Chopsticks." "Chopsticks"? That's advanced. It's still early. I always go to bed early. My father insisted if I didn't get enough rest, I'd end up with bags like Duke Ellington. Um... my, uh, my bag's at your place. Well, send somebody by and bring it to you. You're not going to invite me to spend the night? My dear, new, best friend I have absolutely no interest in you spending the night. You're the wrong gender. That's cold, man. You realize you spent a good deal of my money on drinks for your friends, who seem to be everybody? Thank you very much. Very generous of you. See you tomorrow, I'm sure. Good night, Mr. Schiller. Bon soir, Freddy. Bye. Nice party. Good night. You realize we're causing a scandal. Tongues are beginning to wag. I hadn't notice anything... except you. You notice. You notice everything. Are you willing to hurt anyone to get what you want? I'm willing to be honest. Are you? I'm always honest. Then, tell me honestly what you want. What I have... and a family. Are you proposing to me? ( laughing ) You are a politician... an already very-married politician, lest we forget. And for you, sir. When it comes to women, you are definitely not to be trusted. Oh, I can be trusted once I'm understood. I will admit, uh, being Mrs. Adam Clayton Powell isn't always easy. I wouldn't think being Mrs. Adam Clayton Powell would be any harder than being Mr. Hazel Scott, actually. Touche. ( chuckling ) Touche. ( laughing ) Fishing is like women. Once you develop the touch, the fish find you. ( chuckles ) Of course, you don't want every fish to find you. So, when you broke up with Isabel you were free to see Hazel openly. Well, actually, it was Isabel who was let free. That's one way of looking at it without feeling guilty. No, I feel guilty about it. She was given a raw deal. This is the end, bunny girl. I'm sorry. Why? Because once upon a time, you were ahead of me. Then I caught you, then I passed you. I can't sustain the distance. ( crying ) But she hated politics. I was moving into the big time. ( horn honking ) ( chanting ): Powell! Powell! Powell! Powell! ( chanting continuing ) Who do we want in Congress? Powell! Now, I want all of you to take every one of those signs and walk throughout the entire City of New York. Are we willing to work together? Yeah! To fight together? Yeah! To worship together? Yeah! To win together? Yeah! To vote together? Yeah! Walk together, children. Don't you get weary. POWELL: While the talk of New York City was the spectacular wedding reception we had at cafe society Hazel and I chose to have our actual wedding be a small, private affair out of town. The king had his queen and was ready to roll. MAN ( over newsreel ): The preacher from Harlem arrives in Washington! POWELL: I was elected to Congress by Harlem but I was the representative in government for every black person in America. Thank you. All these love letters. And there's more in your office, in Odell's office in Waldo and Maxine's office and in the downstairs post office. I want information on every congressman... every congressman's staff. I want to know every bill that's been passed the last ten years and how those bills got passed. I want to know who's who, what who wants and how they think. Yes, Adam. Gossip, skeletons... weaknesses, strengths, dirt-- we need every advantage we can get. I want to move so fast we make half the Congress dizzy, the other half pass out from exhaustion. Everybody knows there's a bad Negro in Congress now. I want you all to be known as my bad Negro staff. WOMAN: Yes, sir. ( phone ringing ) ( chuckles ) ( speaking indistinctly ) Hey, boy... you seen that new Negro Congressman Powell yet? No, sir, not that I know of. Oh, you'll know him-- Colored man with a big mouth. Thinks he's going to come down here and raise hell. That boy's got some big surprises in store for him. Congressman Rankin from Mississippi. Senator Bilbo. I recognize you boys, too. I think it's a damn disgrace you got elected, Powell. Now, don't you sit anywhere near me, hear? You better watch yourself. This ain't New York. ( elevator bell dings ) Southern rules govern this city. ( elevator bell dings ) My, my, Grandma... what a red neck you have. A lot of folks think I'm the first and only Negro up in here. Now, now, Adam, that's not fair to Congressman Dawson from Chicago. Now, he may not be as... Cool. My, you do wonders for a size four. Parisian? Actually, confrontational was what I had in mind. But I hear he makes progress... quietly. Nonsense. Keep walking, Hattie. Progress is a bloody guerrilla war. You have to keep pushing, plotting, scratching, fighting. Never let them rest. Keep them squirming. Be a burr in their saddle. Otherwise, they control and define your progress-- you crawl after scraps. Well, I don't think I'll be able to eat with all these people staring at me. Think of it this way, Hattie, you're not just eating to eat. You're eating to help the whole human race. You're eating to help these poor souls evolve. Adam, I'm eating 'cause you're dragging me. That, too. ...lobster bisque for miles away. My father cooked it almost every... ( room grows quiet ) MAN: Good afternoon. I'm sorry, there's absolutely no seats anywhere, sir. Oh, no, no, not at all. We'll just take those chairs there. Please, sir. Please. Congressman Rankin how nice of you to stand. Yes, I know that Congressman Dawson and other Negroes aren't allowed to eat here, but... things will be changing. Bye, y'all. Ah, my good friend. Yes, sir? Listen, brother, I know with all these good old boys around there's got to be some fried chicken and collard greens around. We need to fatten her up... I'm kidding. Whatever's the chef's special and two house salads. Yes, sir. Make sure they don't spit in it. Lunch smells good. ( knocking ) Come in. It's not locked. Compliments of Miss Hazel Scott. Thank you, Walter. Since I was in the neighborhood I thought I'd drop by and give you dinner... and a show. Since you did forget our dinner date tonight. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sure you are. Why don't you come here, brown sugar. No, no, no. You just keep on working. Just tell me what I can do. ( chuckles ) You know, I do believe in accomplishment. Even though I loathe DC politics. It's horse manure. What did I do right? You're a dream. I know. Don't wake me. What's the matter with me forgetting dinner with a beautiful creature like you. I don't know. But... Don't let it happen again. Or what? Or I'll have to punish you. Is that a promise? Yeah. You know, I actually think Hazel hated the game of politics more than Isabelle. She was a natural activist. Smartest woman I ever met... and the least tolerant. Of what? Hazel's West Indian. Like Ray Jones. Proud as hell, sensitive to slights. They come from a place where being black is the rule not the exception. Add to that the complexity of the British influence-- aloof and slightly superior-- I think there were damn few white Americans Hazel met she didn't feel superior to. So, did Hazel's superior attitude ever give you any problems as an American black? Are you crazy? I loved her for it. She was as bold as I was. Well, almost. ( piano playing ) ( dramatic piano music ) Bravo. Magnificent. What, baby? What did I do now? Nothing, Adam. Absolutely nothing. First time I ever got in trouble for that. Lady, you're polishing silverware. You don't do chores. I may as well start. Get on my knees, scrub the floor walk around with my head down, don't look at anybody in the eye. Sure as hell doesn't mean anything to be a Congressman's wife around here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. What's going on? Is this about Constitution Hall? How did you know that, Adam? Did you know those witches were going to look at me in the face and say I was not allowed? No. They did that to Marion Anderson five years ago. I thought for sure they would let you... It's a policy that has to be addressed. You used me. You set this up knowing that I was going to be turned away. You couldn't be a pawn on your worst day. Oh, don't touch me. Hazel, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Those nothings had the nerve to tell me, Hazel Scott who has performed for crowned heads of Europe that I was not welcome to perform at Constitution Hall. It was humiliating. You have every right to perform at that hall. Don't you ever do that to me again. ( door slams ) The President will see you now. Thank you. Congressman Powell. Mr. President. Thank you for granting me an unofficial visit. You have been busy. Thank you, sir. It was not a compliment. This, uh, Powell Amendment I hear you intend to attach to bills in Congress will mean nothing but trouble. The Powell Amendment expresses my belief that any money collected from the public at large should not be redistributed to support in any way any group that would discriminate. Such a system is unacceptable to any thinking person. To expect compliance is stupid, really. It's like expecting someone to pay for a house that they can't set foot in. Are you talking about the concert your wife was prevented from doing at Constitution Hall? The Daughters of the American Revolution had no right to deny my wife the right to perform there because of her color. Not to mention the fact that Crispus Attucks, a Negro was one of the first... the first to die in the very American Revolution they base their name on. I know how you feel about that. I've read it in every damn newspaper that would listen to you. We pay taxes like everyone else. Those taxes help support that hall and taxation without representation is tyranny, sir. Well, even though you called my wife-- what was it-- "the last lady of the land" and anointed Eleanor Roosevelt as the "first..." Excuse me, sir. Please let me clarify. I made that distinction because, as you know when the great singer Marion Anderson was denied the right to perform at Constitution Hall Mrs. Roosevelt resigned her position in the DAR. Whereas, with all due respect, sir your wife attended one of their tea parties. You, sir, are playing politics. You knew the policy. You set this whole thing up to cause trouble. I want to make one thing clear-- my wife Bess bears no ill will toward your wife or Negro people with her membership in the DAR. You well know that neither of us have any control over management or policy of private enterprise. Forgive me, sir but that's precisely the point. It is not private enterprise when public money is used to support the very institutions that insult us. You're as stubborn as I've heard. I prefer to think of it as... proper determination. Well... Thank you for the visit, Congressman Powell. Thank you, Mr. President. The pleasure was all mine. Tell him that this is precisely the same problem... HAZEL: Did you get an apology? Hattie, will you excuse us? An invitation to perform that I can turn down? No. No, the best I could get was, uh was to get him to say that his wife didn't bear any ill will toward you. No ill will... Ill will. Adam, you could've lied to me and told me the man said he was sorry. Does anyone in Washington have sense? That includes you, Adam. I wonder how you can hear your fellow congressmen use the word "nigger" on the Congress floor, and then you shake their hands and you smack them on the back as if they're friends. Doesn't it drive you crazy? No. What drives me crazy is when there's anybody who thinks that they have the right to tell us no. Who thinks that they can tell us-- who helped build this country-- that there's any place that we can't go. So they can call me nigger, they can call me anything they want to on the floors of that Congress, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let them treat the future Hazel Scotts of this world the way that they treated you. And I don't like it, baby. I don't like the rules any more than you do. I'm going to shove those goddamned rules down their throats until they change them. That's just what I'm going to do. I'm going to die trying. Well, you can't die yet. I still need you. What do you need me for? You make more money than I do. Well, I, uh, might have to take some time off pretty soon. For what? Don't you notice anything about me different? A little, uh, weight gain? An aura? Glow maybe? Are you sure? ( chuckles ) Positive. Oh, baby, that-that's wonderful. That's wonderful news. Now I'm going to need a lot more of your time, Mr. Powell, a lot more. Every second I can spare. ( up-tempo jazz music plays ) ( scatting ) ( laughing ) REPORTER: Protests continue to come in from around the world, as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, convicted for giving atom bomb secrets to the Russians, were the first U.S. civilians to be executed for espionage.

( slow jazz horn plays ) ( whistle blowing ) ( whistle blows ) What made you change your mind and invite me to stay? Well, you behaved yourself, relatively speaking. And you act like a man that's running out of money. Sensitivity? No. Pity. It's the most useless emotion in the universe. That medallion... that was a gift from Haile Selassie, right? Yes. The great emperor gave me this medallion when he came to visit me at Abyssinia. It's the oldest dynasty in the world started by King Solomon, Makeda, Queen of Sheba. He also gave me a solid gold cross that hangs in Abyssinia. What was your greatest accomplishment in life? Ah, it's no question... my two sons. My oldest son my first born, Adam III. You already know about him. He's a fine man his own man. This one... Adam IV... Had him with my third wife Yvette. Think he's going to follow in my footsteps. Look at those eyes. See that fire. Who is she? That's my sister Blanche... the light of my formative years. She died when I was 17. I'm sorry. Obviously, she meant a lot to you. Yes, she did. Good-looking family. But I meant in your work. What is your greatest accomplishment in your career? My career? It's not over yet, my friend. Well, you are at the age where most folks retire. And you do seem somewhat retired down here. Well, my accomplishments are like my children. I can't pick one over the other. Every successful rent strike, every job I was able to pry loose for a black person, every appointment I enabled myself to make, every bill I got passed, every employer I forced to give his workers a minimum wage, every cracker I pissed off because I out-slicked his ass... I'll let the history books decide. Nights are bringing a little bit more chill of late. My greatest accomplishment may be that I survived for so damn long. Mr. Speaker, I'm sure you'll fully appreciate the irony of my having to come to the halls of Congress to sue for the right for Negro criminals to have a fair shot at crime in their own communities. The fact of the matter is, that corruption involving organized crime, the Mob, and the New York Police Department is unacceptable. The white Mob takes money from the hardworking Negroes of Harlem and put nothing back. Meanwhile, the white New York Police Department busts only the Negro numbers men in attempt to help their white Mafia friends keep their competition down. Now, it's a damn shame when the law discriminates in corruption, don't you think? I'm as comfortable with that as I am with the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan working with Southern Democrats to pass Negro civil rights legislation. ( murmuring ) Although I'm sure that my esteemed colleagues from the great South would never participate with such a hateful, hurtful band of cowardly thugs. ( telephone ringing ) ( ringing continues ) Hello. MAN: Hazel... tell your husband to do himself and his family a favor and keep his nose the hell out of Harlem's numbers business. Who is this? I don't know what you're talking about and I don't want you to call here anymore. ( telephone rings ) ( ringing continues ) Thank God you're home. Baby, what's wrong? The phone's been ringing all night. Someone's threatening us. I think it has to do with that numbers thing. ( phone ringing ) Can't we just go away, me, you and Skipper? This really scared me. Can't go fishing on this one, baby. What exactly did they say? What does the Mob always say? If it's not one crisis, it's another and another and another and if there isn't one, you create one. Can't... can't you just let this one go, please? This has nothing to do with you getting ahead in Congress. It has everything to do with my doing anything. I can't stand by and watch my people get fleeced by New York cops working with New York mobsters. Do you remember what your father said about trying to fight too many battles on too many fronts? Don't quote my father to me. I know what my father said and I know what I got to do to get where I'm going. I was elected to serve the people. Baby, I got to serve the people. Maybe you should've married the people. I did, baby. Way before I met you. I told you that. I thought I made it very clear. It is very clear. I care for the people, too, but I put my family first. ( telephone rings ) ( telephone thuds ) I'm Lester Wolff of Between the Lines, and we have with us the controversial outspoken Congressman from Harlem, Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. We will speak with Congressman Powell about corruption between the Mob and the New York Police Department the alleged politically- motivated tax fraud charges Congressman Powell faces and death threats from a misguided mobster. Welcome, Congressman Powell. You said on the floor of Congress that there is an alleged bagwoman. No, she's very real. A woman who delivers money payoffs from the Mob to the police named Esther James. Is that correct? Yes, and everyone in Harlem knows it. Adam Clayton Powell said in a statement today that he refuses to pay the civil judgment in the defamation lawsuit brought against him, bringing the very real possibility of his arrest. This is a victory not just for Adam Clayton Powell. The victory bell that you hear ringing is a victory for the people of Harlem, for the people of my district, for all throughout the Congress of the United States of America. There will be no railroading of Adam Clayton Powell in this instance. I think it is not just a victory for me, it is a victory for you. And please print what I say, baby. I am saying exactly what I mean and I mean what I say. MINISTER: When the Lord said, "Turn the other cheek" he didn't mean stick your face out there and get knocked down. Nothing wrong with rolling with the punch. The Lord wasn't a fool. Anything you want is yours. No, it isn't. Why Paris? What the hell is in Paris? Why not here in New York? Because that's where I want to go and that's what I want to do. You go where you want to go and you do what you want to do. I'm not usually at a loss for words, but I... Thank you, Hazel, for everything. "Thank you"? "Thank you," Adam? I'm not one of your colleagues. This is not some pleasant political disagreement. I am your wife and I'm angry. Will you...? I'm going to miss you, lady. I'm going to miss you bad. Well, I hope you get your chairmanship or your speakership or whatever the hell it is you want before they get you. I'm not so easy to get. Skipper. You got to be a man now. Got to take care of your mom and yourself. You hear? I'll see you in a little bit. Yes, sir. Remember, head up, shoulders back palms out. You're a Powell man. Go on. I got some chores to do around here. Want to earn your keep? Well, if you're willing to keep answering questions. What are you smiling about? Talk is cheap. You're a bargain. Let's get to work. Hold on. Let me ask you a question. So, after Eisenhower, you supported Kennedy? Didn't want to particularly, right off. Nixon had the boy Kennedy on my committee. He supported the southern Dixiecrats on most issues. But, yeah, I worked with him after the better man at the time, Johnson, didn't get the nomination. Now, Adam, I don't care what presidential candidate Symington and Kennedy come around selling. Lyndon here is going to be the man to beat. You just tell Speaker Sam what you want for your backing. He'll let you know if it's possible. My seniority protected from the Dixiecrats and the Republicans. Done. And I want the chairmanship of the Education and Labor Committee. You should rightfully have what is rightfully yours, according to seniority. I will support that fully. Mr. Jones? The best way to go about this is quietly. I will deliver on behalf of Congressman Powell and myself at least half the delegate votes that Senator Johnson will get on the first ballot. If he wins the presidential nomination we will throw our full support behind him. If not, we must be free to do what's best for the party. Your reputation is well earned, Mr. Jones. No matter who ends up being the Democratic nominee, Congressman Powell will get full Democratic support for the Education and Labor chairmanship which he rightfully deserves. ( chuckles ) Deal. POWELL: Through all the politicking and backroom dealing, it ended up JFK against Nixon, but as I promised my father, I had to remain independent. Are you ready? I was born ready, Ray. Bobby... Ray. the Congressman will see you. Bobby, baby. Offer you a cigar? Thanks. Ray smoked half my stash. I'm going to give it to him anyway. I think it's brilliant what you boys are doing with Jack's campaign. Any chance of getting Sinatra and Sammy up here to help me campaign in Harlem? I'll see what I can do. Well, Bobby, as we discussed earlier-- and Adam agrees with me-- the only way we're going to get an Irish Catholic into the White House is if the base of the Democratic party comes together. That's right, but just one question, Congressman. Why did you ask the other Negro delegates not to support Jack at the convention? Jack accepted the support of the segregationist Governor John Patterson from Alabama. He refused to vote to censure Joe McCarthy, he's got a lousy record on civil rights. Now you boys beat Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic nomination, but there's no way you're going to beat Nixon for the presidency if I don't help, I guarantee it. JONES: So if we can work something out, maybe Jack can become president after all. Well, that depends on what you want, Congressman. First topic is the Education and Labor Committee chairmanship. When I'm chair, I don't want any interference with my authority or my seniority. I want Jack to back me. And second, you and your brother are going to have to change your ways on civil rights and the Negro. JONES: Well, Bobby? What about it? I don't know. I'll have to take that back to Jack. But I'll tell you one thing-- Jack Kennedy will be a lot better for the Negro people than Nixon. Well, he's got to get elected first. REPORTER: Martin Luther King says that neither Republicans nor Democrats address the needs of the Negro, and that his people must do something to address this in the upcoming election. Who is this Southern Negro minister? Thank you, darling. Who gives Martin Luther King the right to speak for all Negroes? This cat's trying to take my job. I just found out that he and A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin plan to protest both the Democratic and Republican parties. What? No, I made a deal with Bobby Kennedy there weren't going to be any demonstrations during the campaign. I traded for power that's going to benefit all Negroes, and now these bush leaguers are going to mess it up? You tell those amateurs Adam Clayton Powell says, "Call it off." Already put out that feeler. "No." No? You tell Martin Luther King that if he doesn't call it off I'm going to spread the word that his chief aide Rustin is a homosexual. Rustin's a homo, yeah? Yes. He doesn't deny it. You tell King if he doesn't call it off I'm going to tell the world that he and his friend, Bayard Rustin, are having a homosexual affair. You can't do that, Adam. It isn't true. Neither is most of the stuff out there about me but I have to carry the weight. I negotiated for power that's going to benefit all Negroes and I'm not going to have that jeopardized by Martin Loser King or anybody else. What is this? Demonstrations and marches? I did that 20 years ago. So you were shooting for as high up as you could go in government? No. I was shooting for as much power as I could gain in government because that's how changes are made in Washington. Marching and protesting eventually get on people's nerves; get very little done. Get an education, learn a profession, go into business, politics. Go after the real power, baby. Gentlemen, I've been waiting for the last 15 minutes for all of you to arrive. My expectations are simple: we don't come late. We work as long and as hard as we have to get bills drafted and passed, quickly. Now let's get to work. It is now 15 minutes after the hour. The meeting will officially come to order. I doubled everything of my predecessor, Graham Barden, and his staff. Give me that hammer, young blood. Graham Barden believed the earth am flat and the sun do move. I doubled the meetings, budget requests and more than quadrupled his results. Come on, baby, keep moving. Time's a-wasting. In one 14-month period, I was responsible for the passage of 14 bills. Now, that is a record that no chairman in the history of the United States Congress has before or since achieved. In the six years I was committee chairman, I never lost one bill once it reached the House floor. That's why it was important I keep getting reelected. Congress operates by seniority, relationships, experience. It takes years to acquire all three. So the woman says "I thought you were a man of the cloth." I said, "I am, baby. Silk." I'll see you fellas later. Thanks. I appreciate the vote. Over time I was able to maneuver even my worst enemies. I was most proud of taking Congress to the streets of Harlem. ♪ ...release your hold and I will set you free ♪ ♪ The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye ♪ ♪ And said, "Your story's so touching, sounds like a lie." ♪ All cameras will have to stop. The meeting will officially come to order. What got me was how, over time, eventually my most reluctant colleagues learned to like it. This is America for whom we serve! REPORTER: Over half a million people were in attendance in this historic march on Washington. Martin Luther King stirred the passions of the crowd, if not the nation, with a rousing speech about his dreams of what America can be. It is generally agreed that King's words made this a day that will long be remembered. And now we go to a live report from the Washington Monument. Martin Luther King may have just made the speech of the century. Anybody can have a dream. The question is whether or not you can turn that dream into a reality. Maybe we should have stayed in the stands. To do what, Ray? Be part of the crowd? Part of King's audience? Man, that ought to be my show. My speech would have been "I have a plan." I can't believe my good friend Martin would have an event like this in my town and not invite me to speak. You didn't exactly endear yourself with that homosexual ploy between him and Bayard. It's politics, Ray. Besides, he's a pacifist. He turns the other cheek. Let's white folks slap him around. He's supposed to be above all that. This is history, baby! I ought to be right in the center of it! Would you invite you to speak if you were him? Are you kidding? No way. Besides, everybody knows Powell would probably steal the whole goddamn show. Early '60s, in spite of the schemes of all my enemies things were looking pretty good for me to get things done. Jack Kennedy and I became pretty close. Ain't nothing jumpin' but the peas in the pot and they wouldn't be jumpin' if the water wasn't hot. Ow! ( laughing ) Finally won one, young blood. That's right. Changing of the guard. New blood on the block. ( clears throat ) Um... you were saying about Jack Kennedy...? I was saying Jack Kennedy and I became very close. He kept his word. I had full access to the White House. I had his complete support. About a year later, it finally hit me. I think I cried for the better part of a night. A lot of things have been said about Jack Kennedy. I wasn't always a fan, but... The man I came to know had the milk of human kindness in his veins. In my opinion, Kennedy's assassination was the result of a conspiracy. Oswald was a patsy. I know there were unseen hands planning the death of King, Malcolm and Bobby, burning cities, riots and chaos, but, through it all, I had to stay focused on what I was fighting against: Inequality, injustice... the trampling of basic human civil rights. Now, these are not the goals set down by the Founding Fathers reaching for the best of what was inside of them. Lyndon Johnson was a skilled ally. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Dear Adam... the fifth anniversary of your chairmanship of the House Education and Labor Committee reflects a brilliant record of accomplishment. It represents the successful reporting to Congress on 49 pieces of bedrock legislation and the passage of every one of these bills attests to your ability to get things done. The poverty program is rapidly paving new pathways to progress for those whom the economic vitality of this land had previously bypassed. There's a glass; there you are. The education measures are being translated into fuller opportunities for all our citizens to develop their God-given talents to their fullest potential. Minimum wage-- long a guarantee of a fair return for an honest day's work-- has been increased and greatly extended, and the problems of juvenile delinquency are being met and curtailed by positive and determined action. Only with progressive leadership could so much have been accomplished by one committee in so short a time. I speak for millions of Americans who benefit from these laws when I say I am truly grateful. Sincerely yours, Lyndon B. Johnson. Even though you were such a good chairman they still went after you? Think, young blood. It was precisely because I was an active and successful chairman that the enemies of civil rights and progressive government came after me. If I'd done nothing and spoke softly, they would've left me alone. CONGRESSMAN: He considers himself above the law and above the House of Representatives. And I guess he was down in Bimini, as I stated, he was down there with a glass in one hand and a woman in the other hand, and I don't think it's incumbent upon us as responsible members of the House to belabor ourself with a man with an attitude such as that. He has demonstrated over and over again, in my judgment, that he is not a suitable person to participate in enacting laws to govern the people of this country. Adam Powell is a symbol that all black people can organize around! ( cheering and applause ) There is no black man in America bigger than Adam Clayton Powell. ( cheering ) ( chanting ): We want Powell! Now! Back in the chair! Right now! We want Powell! Back in the chair! POWELL: The Celler Committee during their so-called investigation of me even dragged my third wife Yvette in front of them. I know this committee wants to be fair and I hope its report will be favorable to my husband. Miss Scott, you recently got back from a concert tour of Europe and the Middle East. How long have you been back now? Yes, uh, altogether, just about six months. Six months-- so you've obviously been back long enough to have heard about the difficulties that your ex-husband, Congressman Powell has been going through. How do you feel about that? Well, I think it's eminently unfair what's happening to him, I really do the fact that he's been charged for something that other congressmen consider everyday occurrences. As a matter of fact, in a Life magazine article which I read last week where this Congressman Hays was a chairman of a special subcommittee to investigate Federal printing and paperwork, and between May and June of 1958, Congressman Hays took 52 trips that cost over $1,000 each out of funds allocated by Congress for NATO. I gather you're quite angry about that. I have to ask you this: what is your evaluation of him as a Congressman? I'm just a private citizen, so my evaluation doesn't matter. But let's ask Lyndon Johnson for his evaluation of him; late President Kennedy what his evaluation of his... uh, Speaker John McCormack-- they said that he was the best chairman on the Hill and that's good enough for me. You know, I can't help noticing you speak about Congressman Powell, your ex-husband with such affection and loyalty. I have to ask this: is there any chance that you two might get back together again? Oh, no. No, no. We are friends; we remain friends and we have a son together who we're very proud of, but no, not at all. Mr. Speaker. You know, the number of congressmen who want to deny Adam Clayton Powell his seat in Congress is no longer a few good ol' boys in backroom card games. It's becoming a crusade. Mm-hmm. And I been thinking: if we were to strip him of his chairmanship in Education and Labor-- which essentially reduces him to nothing-- this might satisfy the Republicans the Southern Democrats and the others that want to run him out of Congress. I'm not sure that'll be enough, John. Well, for heaven's sakes, if you strip a man of all his power, what else could they possibly want? Well, there is one thing he could give his colleagues that might help-- something that none of us have ever seen before. What could that be? Humility. ( chuckles ) ( bells tolling outside ) Adam... J. Raymond Jones. What can I do for you? I need to talk to you. Please sit down. I'm not here for me, Adam. King, Randolph, Farmer, every black leader, every black newspaper, every black person, is doing everything they can to help you, but you have to help yourself. When have you known me not to? All who see this are agreed that you've written a great speech. The tone is right. Contrite? Diplomatic. There's a lot more at stake than your pride, Adam. You owe the people who put you here. I'll be the judge of who I owe and what. I've made it my point to study those men out there, my fellow congressmen, who now sit in judgment of me, and if all the lying, shameless hypocrites were to leave, there wouldn't be enough men left in that room to vote. You still have to give the speech. I don't have to do a damn thing except for stay black and die. Adam, please. Sit down. You're one of the most powerful black men of this century maybe the most ever and I know you like the distinction but if you don't do this, 100 years from now most people are not going to know who you are. But I will. Save that for the lecture circuit, Adam. I know better. You can't have it all this time! And I don't care how many congressional hypocrites you can point to who have done the same or worse you bet your career on righteous indignation and you're going to lose. McCORMACK: The Speaker at this time would like to acknowledge the Representative from New York, Emmanuel Celler who has been chairing the bipartisan committee which was investigating the allegations against Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. and they, at this time, are ready to make their recommendations to the House. Mr. Celler. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Except for three instances of treason, and that was during the Civil War, resolutions of expulsion either failed to receive the necessary two-thirds vote or lost, and a resolution of censure was substituted and approved. Mr. Powell's wrongdoing does not rise to the heights of malevolence such as treason. This bipartisan committee recommends: First, that the duly elected Mr. Powell be administered the oath of office. ( murmurs of approval ) Second, that Adam Clayton Powell be publicly censured by the Speaker in the name of the House. Third, that Adam Clayton Powell pay the Clerk of the House $40,000 to offset his civil liabilities. Thank you. ( clamoring ) ( gavel pounding ) The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Gross. Mr. Speaker, I have a reasonably strong stomach but it will revolt at the aroma that will arise in this chamber if today, Adam Clayton Powell is offered a seat in this chamber! Hear! Hear! Mr. Speaker! ( gavel pounding ) The Speaker recognizes from Ohio the gentleman, Mr. Devine. Censure is sufficient humiliation? Who are we kidding? Humility does not appear to be one of the gentleman's virtues. ( congressional members murmuring ) ( gavel pounding ) The Speaker recognizes Mr. Hall, the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. Speaker, Powell is uncensurable unembarrassable and irresponsible. Thank you. MAN: Yes! Yes! Mr. Speaker! The Speaker acknowledges from West Virginia the gentleman, Mr. Moore. My fellow Congressmen, if we reject the recommendation that the committee you appointed has so carefully delivered we will all be on a collision course with the courts of this land. Hear! Hear! ( gavel pounding ) ( scattered applause ) The Speaker at this time would like to acknowledge the presence of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. of New York in the House, and I call him forward to speak to the House. ( congressional members murmuring ) ( scattered applause ) Mr. Speaker... my esteemed colleagues... everyone here in Congress knows that there are many among us who have done far, far worse than that which I am accused of. Some of the truly guilty have spoken out against me. There is no one here who does not have skeletons in his closet and I know who owns what skeletons. ( congressional members murmuring ) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. MAN: Mr. Speaker! ( gavel pounding ) Mr. Speaker! The Speaker acknowledges the gentleman from California, Mr. Van Deerlin. Mr. Speaker, the unbelievable arrogance that has just been demonstrated by Mr. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. without a single regret expressed, no apologies, calls for a motion on this floor that this gentleman be expelled from this House and a special election called for his replacement. MAN: Absolutely. Mr. Speaker I gladly second that motion. SPEAKER: The results of the resolution to exclude Adam Clayton Powell from this House are yeas: 248 nays: 176 zero abstentions. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. of New York is excluded from this, the 90th Congress. ( gavel pounding ) What are you going to do, Adam? Kunstler, Reid, Reeves, Kinoy, Carter, Delaney Covington, the two Williamses, Henry and Bennet they're all on the way over. I think I've got enough lawyers. I'm going to take this miscarriage of justice to the Supreme Court. But in the meantime? Well, they're going to hold a special election in Harlem to replace me. I'm going to win it by a landslide while I'm fishing down in Bimini. The irony of it is, is that Wayne Hays, of the Hays Committee who led the charge I misused funds-- one of the two main charges they booted me out of Congress for-- was himself the center of a White House scandal because he took a House headwaiter on a junket to Paris. Adam, you were guilty. I mean, you did do the things they accused you of. You did use travel vouchers improperly. You did have relatives on the payroll and you did not settle the libel suit brought against you by Esther James for calling her a "bagwoman" in public. Well, she was, damn it! You can't count that as a reason to boot me out. That only shows how desperate they were to get me. And it's not illegal or improper for congressmen to have relatives on the payroll if they're working. And on the "misuse of funds charge" now, when I was asked to appear before the Hays Committee I stipulated I would only do so if I were allowed to cross-examine witnesses including congressmen-- the basic right of the American judicial system-- but my fellow congressmen... they knew if I were allowed to question them we could easily wind up drawing lots to see who was the guilty congressman who ought to be punished. Everybody had some so-called "questionable" travel items. I know I was far from the worst. Hell, I could ask Hays himself who it was that paid for the almost 50 trips between Washington and his home in Ohio. But, still, man, you took yourself out of the game. Leaders have to conduct themselves in a way in which they don't get busted. Leaders have to live, too, young blood. Leaders have to make mistakes. And when you're more mature, you will know that's one of the most important parts about being honest about who you are. Naw, man. You have to hold yourself to a higher standard, 'cause when you mess up, you mess up everybody who was counting on you. I found this laying around the house. You might get some mileage out of it. Thank you. You know, if you were a better fisherman we might have had some fun. It's getting a little late. Aren't you concerned about those Duke Ellington eyes? No. Not as much as I used to be. You'd better get off this island, Adam. Catch up with the times. You're wrong again, kid. It's the times that need to catch up to me. What time's your plane tomorrow? My plane leaves at noon. Well, I'll see you in the morning. Sweet dreams, kid. ( knocking ) Hey, wake up. What? We're here to see Congressmen Powell. Who are you? We're newspaper reporters. So? We're here to get Congressman Powell's reaction to the Supreme Court ruling. What did they rule? He won. That's right. He won. He won. ( whistles ) Mr. Powell! Sir... Hey, there he is! Mr. Powell... Adam... Do you have a quote for the press, sir? Adam! Could we get a statement, please, sir? Right. Sir, what's your reaction to the Supreme Court's decision? Two things happened today: One, I was vindicated, but more importantly, this decision proves that there is still justice in the United States. REPORTER: What about your salary and fines? That came to how much, sir? $80,000 or thereabouts. Well, if they wrongly took away my seat I think it only stands to reason they wrongly took away my salary, wouldn't you say? What about your seat and seniority? I think they should give that back, too. Believe me, my lawyers will be making every effort to see that these issues are resolved. REPORTER: Do you harbor any ill feelings? No. No, dear boy, of course not. Life is too short for that. I pray each and every night for those shameless hypocrites who took away my seat. SCHILLER: That was the last I saw of Adam Clayton Powell. Someone told me that if you look closely, you can see death on a man's face. I went down to Bimini and saw a great man dying and didn't know it. I think of all those nights I was there and all the questions I should have asked but didn't. Now I never can. And just like he said he would Adam was reelected by the people of Harlem while he was in Bimini. He served again in Congress and even though he was vindicated by the Supreme Court he never got back his seniority, his money nor his chairmanship. Someone ransacked his home the night after he died. The textbook he was working on, along with his journals writings and the gold medallion bestowed upon him by Haile Selassie disappeared. I finished the story. Did I get it right? I don't know. All I can think is what Adam would have said. Keep the faith, baby. Captioning sponsored by PARAMOUNT PICTURES
