[INHALES] Daddy, I saw life leaving my sister. [OLAJIDE] Hmm. You're the last and only hope I have please. I'm going to stop you right there. Because as you began to speak, the Spirit of God started to direct me. I started opening the scripture. - [MARY] Hallelujah. - I didn't even know where I was going to. - Hallelujah. - I want to give it to you to read it out.

[ELDER 1] You see the expenditure column, [IN IGBO] right? Do you see it? Yeah [CLEARS THROAT] I see it's um... One point five billion. [EXCLAIMS] One point five billion, in two weeks? [IN YORUBA] What is it?! Are you rebuilding the Garden of Eden? I apologize, but um, I...[INHALES] If we take time to look at the same column, you'd realize that... in the last two weeks, we raked in about three billion. Shut up there! Who asked him? Shut up! Shut that your maggot-infested mouth. That was because we took money from other sources, so that we could, you know, clean up and launder her money. I apologize, Chief. But then again, the money was put to wise use. Used wisely? Olajide, [IN HAUSA] are you a fool? [IN ENGLISH] Okay. Now, tell me, what's your own definition of wisdom, Olajide? Because of me, I mean, buying of Range Rovers, Rolls Royce and beach house... [STUTTERS] Wait a minute. You bought a beach house! Beach?! [IN HAUSA] What! [ELDER 1] Stupid man! I understand that this sum looks outrageous but please, hear me out. I didn't buy it out of vanity or frivolities, I bought it because it's an investment. So, bottom-line, I'm investing.[INHALES] You see, when I take a picture in the Range Rover or the Rolls Royce, or in the beach house, [INHALES] and I post on social media, I know you're not on social media but how it works is, I post such nice pictures and then, the comments come in, in the hundreds, the likes, the follows. And all these things are the things that people want to see that make them go to the churches. I mean, they go to all the branches because of what they see. It's how this business is run. [INHALES] Now, I promise, [SCOFFS] it wasn't anything vanity and God sees my heart. [WOMAN 4] God? [SCOFFS] - Who is your God, Olajide? - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES TO PLAY] Let me help you. The boy from a no-name street in Abeokuta. Drenched in seven generations of poverty. Reeking with it. When you prayed to your divine being in the sky, did it change your fortunes? Olajide, I changed your fortunes. I put you on a pedestal to shine. So I ask you one more time, Who is your God? Answer! [ECHOING] You. You are my God. You've been weighed, measured, judged, and found wanting. You'll move to Ajangbadi branch and the Pastor there will take over your branch. [OLAJIDE] Madam, please! Please, don't move me from the church. This project is my brainchild. Please, [STUTTERS] I can't... [YELLS] Quiet! Bow before your God! [ECHOING] Think I wanna have time for this stupidity? You took an oath! I'll let this go.

All of this is getting too much. Ah, Asabi! When you were born, I took a look at your future. The outcome was that you are destined to have just one child. Now, am I supposed to allow the enemy to throw the only hot coal I have away? Don't you think my Ifá priesthood and my herbal expertise would be questioned? That is why I keep on fortifying you. [SUCKS TEETH] [LAUGHING] - [LAUGHING] - [IN YORUBA] What is it? It's as loose as a wrapper. [LAUGHING] - Wale! - It's not your fault. Wale!

Let me put a call through to him, ma. [OLAJIDE TUTS] Now, three thousand people already RSVPed to be there. And all these are not church members. So from email correspondence and statistics taken, we're expecting about seven thousand people to show up. And on a side note, four out of the seven governors we invited, have sent their apologies that they will not make it. But they are sending representatives. Which I think is still very good for the books. - Yes. [LAUGHING] - [IN HAUSA] That is okay. It's very good for the books. Very good. Because they will atone for their absence. In doing that they are going to double the donations that they are supposed to make. [ELDER3] [IN IGBO] As it should be. - [IN IGBO] Guy, you've grown. - [ALL LAUGH] - This boy is grown. - Yes.

Are you seeking solutions for problems in your life? Come before me at this very hour. Listen, if you want to break free... Evangelist, pray for me! - Are you ready? - I am ready. - You want to break free? - I am ready sir! God Almighty! - Now, let me pray for you. Covenant God. - Amen. We pray for this young man. - Be liberated! - Amen. - You are freed! - Amen. So shall it be. What is it? Look at that man. Is his cloth better than mine? Yet, he is making money. Maybe I should do what he's doing. Preaching the gospel and getting money. This woman has come before you. You are free! Amen! - Take it out! - Amen! - Take it out! - Amen! - Take it out! - Amen! Wait, put it back! Don't remove it anymore. There's a reason for that. - Please pray for me. - Ah! All challenges clinging to this lady, drop off her body! - Amen! Amen! - Are you under siege or something? Do you want to be unfortunate? Stop bothering me! My brother. My sister. I bring the gospel to you. - Give your life to Jesus. - No! You won't be like those reverends. You'll be like the Lagos pastors that their choristers sing like Americans. [CLEAR THROAT] [IN ENGLISH] Are you feeling down and under, my brother? Do you need solutions and safety my sister? Let me introduce to you, the life saving, life-changing, destiny-resetting God. He will polish you. He will cloak you in his grace and his greatness. Men will see you and ask, "Who is your God?" Can I get an amen? Wait! [IN YORUBA] Where did you learn all this? From Pastor Paul David's sermons. Brother Bayo plays the sermon on his radio regularly. I learnt it from there. [LAUGHS] You memorized it so well! - [IN ENGLISH] And you delivered perfectly. - Mm-hmm. Joblessness gave me the time to listen to radio regularly [LAUGHS] - I said, be liberated in Jesus name. - Amen, in Jesus name. - Say Amen! - Amen in Jesus name! - Your Amen is weak, are you crazy? - Amen in Jesus name! - Be liberated! - [WHISTLING] [GOATS BLEATING] ♪ Give Him praises Give honor to King Jesus ♪ - Be free!

It's a solid car. What are you doing? It will not be well with your people. Amen! [IN ENGLISH] This is where I have a problem with you Yoruba people. This is Nigeria. It's not everybody that understands Yoruba. [IN YORUBA] You are mentally unsound. Make eye contact with me and talk. Listen to me. I am Chief Ifeanyi. - I am a chief, a titled man. - [IN YORUBA] I am not the leader. If that's how you want to play... What do you want? [IN IGBO] what do you want? [IN YORUBA] Look, calm down! You can't unnerve us. - We're in our locality. - Exactly. You don't speak Yoruba! We also don't understand English. - No, we don't! - My name is Kayinsoro. What do you people want? You are stubborn and we'll let you know. - Your payment is a hundred thousand naira. - He doesn't change. [PASTOR] Come. - You claim to seek liberation. - Yes, I want to be free. If you receive liberation, call me a bastard. Bring everything. It seems you're mad. - [COMMOTION FROM THE MEN] - [IFEANYI] Hey! - C'mon, go on! - [IFEANYI] I am a chief! - I like it. Mm-hmm. - Hmm? Let me continue. [CLEARS THROAT] In the beginning, the Lord made the heavens and the earth. [LAUGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [IN YORUBA] What's going on here? Who wants to know what's happening? How has he wronged you? Do you want to beat him? [KAYINSORO] Do you want your life destroyed? - Look closely, my friend. - I'm a chief oh. - What's the problem? - Doesn't he know it's Kayinsoro? Look closely, my friend. What did he do to you? What's going on? Look closely, my friend. That's the drum. [KAYINSORO] Legba, come! Why don't you wait? [KAYINSORO] There's trouble, follow me! That girl, she is the daughter of the man with the drum. They made me beat their drum all over the place. - Thief! - It's okay sir. - [KAYINSORO] She has supernatural powers. - It's okay sir. [LEGBE] We are yet to collect the money. [LEGBA] I said, don't ask for money. - [KAYINSORO] The drum... - She is the herbalist's daughter. - They'll order you to drum round. - Thank you. - I hope they didn't hurt you? - No, I'm okay. Thank you. Do you know those people? That's how they behave in this area sir. - That's how they behave? Ah! - Sorry, sir. Hey! This palm-oil-soup people! - [IN ENGLISH] I hope you are okay sir. - I hope they didn't hurt you. - No, I'm fine. - Sorry sir. I'm a chief. I'm a titled man in my village. But thank you. How can I repay you for saving my life. Uh, sir, if you have money, cash would be good sir. - Money? - Yes sir. No, I don't have money. I am a business man. [STUTTERS] And I don't carry money around. No sir. We do not want your money. My boyfriend needs a job. - Okay, this is your boyfriend. - Yes sir. - And he needs a job. - Yes sir. You should have said you needed a job. I'm sorry sir. Please, sir, I need a job, sir. - Yes sir. - Okay, that's fine. You see, I'm on my way to Lagos. Because I live in Lagos. My office is in Lagos. I'm into real estate. - My name is Chief Ifeanyi Okoro. - Okay sir. My address is there. So you come to Lagos and see me. - In Lagos? - Yes. [INTSENSE SOUND] No skills, no talent. You don't have any experience. So what do I do with you? Okay, all hope is not lost. But it depends on how desperate you are to work. Sir, I've never been this desperate in my life. He can do anything sir. - Hmm? - I swear on my life, sir. - Your life? Ah! - Yes sir. - Okay. - [INTENSE BEATS CONTINUE] Hmm. Can you do organ harvesting? Can you harvest human organs? - Ah! Sir! - Ah! Ma! You see In life, people need human organs to live to survive. Kidneys, human hearts, even intestines. [IN IGBO] Intestines. There's a big market for it. And I, Chief Ifeanyi, I'm one of the biggest suppliers. Those organs, I suppose people have to die for you to take them. Well, you have to think about the people you want to save before you take them. But do one have to die so another can live? Um, I don't have an answer to that question. But it's your people that say, "Something bad must happen to somebody before something good can happen to another person." [EXHALES] I'm sorry, Chief Ifeanyi. Another thing. He can't do that. Asabi wait. You know I need this job. Another thing sir. Okay. I'm sorry, I don't have another thing. But I have money. [DRAWER CLOSES] - Thank you sir. - Thank you too. - Thank you very much sir. - [CHIEF] Thank you too. He can preach. Jide can preach. - Asabi, that's not what he's saying. - Show him. - You can preach? - Please. [IN YORUBA] Sir, don't you understand? There is no better goldmine than opening a church. Daddy, as the crowd increases, I'd have a lot of money. Then, I'll take good care of you. We'll also look after our future wife. - Yes, we'll take good care of Asabi. - Yes sir. - Okay. I get it now. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER OUTSIDE] [EXHALES] Take. What's that in your hand? An ordinary bead. Are you sure? It's a charm. It's a charm sir. When Olukoso opens his mouth, it will catch fire. Ouch! [PANTING] It's burning my palm! It must not fall off. - Ouch! - That's your power. - It's possessing you. - Give it to me. -Ah! Yes -You can feel it, right? - It has entered your body. - I can feel it. [LAUGHS] This is just a little test. See how you're acting. If folks like you are given great power, you will definitely abuse it. If people like you receive great charm, you will use them wrongly. - Asabi, I must not upend that which I got. - Yes father. As for you, it's your stomach that called you not God Almighty. Hence, your quest for charms here and there. You want to impress the Almighty. Asabi, I have no crowd-pulling charm that I can give to your visitors. Jide, Jide. - Jide! Jide! Be patient. - Leave me alone, Wale. - Calm down. - What is it? There might still be a solution. My Love. I will explain to him that you do not want to decieve the people. When the crowd comes, you'll be a good shepherd to them. How are we going to get the crown without the Baba's charm. - We'll find someone else. - There's no one else! [DRUMBEAT] Asabi, your father is the most powerful. There's only one moon. It is unrivaled. Indeed, the moon is unrivaled but there are many stars, all of them with their unique features. There are still powerful people. One of Daddy's friends is in Ilé ife. [IN ENGLISH] But you'll be the one who will go. He mustn't know I'm involved. This will work. This is your moment. I know it. You and I will make it work. When things get terrible, no one will be by your side. Who is that? When things get terrible, no one will be by your side. - [IN ENGLISH] A sabi! What's that? - [SIGHS] Don't mind me. Baba is just playing his tune. I will come when he has slept. - It's time. - Good bye. I've always told you to be patient. Flies approach honey in droves. Ants approach sugar in droves The forest and the wilderness produce cotton from the thorns. The housefly embraces a total stranger. A child approaches birds with excitement. Everyone coddles and cossets the child. Ajé is always a witness wherever he is. Every good person clears the pathway. The elephant's footprints become of water for other animals. Wherever you locate your business, the whole world will come there. The forest and the wilderness will produce cotton from the thorns. Everyone coddles and cossets the child. Take. Eat it. Eat it. It is all good reports about the pepper. Goodness is Edolo's song. Eat. Wherever the fig tree displays is where the whole world will come to. When you finish eating, my son, I will give you something to take. You will bury it. It's made from a boneless pig. [CROWD] Shout hallelujah! Hallelujah! Shout hallelujah! Hallelujah! [UPBEAT GOSPEL MUSIC PLAYING] What character is he playing? Blind man. Oh, he's the blind man. Release! Loose! And your sight will be restored, - Mm! - You'd then shout, "Jesus is Lord!" Pastor Jide has done it. Lord Jesus! Yes. [IN ENGLISH] The lord just spoke to me now. He said to tell you, "Somebody here is destined for greatness." - [OLAJIDE] Yes! - [CROWD CHEERING] - [MALE VOICE] Glory be to the Lord! - [CROWD CHANTING] Thank you, Lord! Olajide. How is it? I have a good news for you. What is it? I am two weeks pregnant. You are going to become a father. What's wrong? Are you not happy? [SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING] Asabi, I just received a terrible news. [IN YORUBA] What happened? [BREATHES SOFTLY] Baba is dying. [SOLEMN MUSIC CONTINUES TO PLAY] - It's okay. - [CRYING] - It's okay. It's okay. - [SOBBING] - Wow! - Eh?! Thank you so much sir. I really appreciate. - Thank you so much sir. - [IFEANYI] Hmm. - You like them? [LAUGHS] - Yes. You see, you're now my boy. So as my boy, I need to take care of you. [LAUGHS] You see, you don't have to thank me now. You and I, we have a long way to go. So you would thank me in the future. [LAUGHS] Jide, one more thing. You have to bring your wife over. Because we also need to package her the way we have packaged you. It's going to look funny if you look good and she looks ugly. - You understand me. - Yes sir. I understand you sir. But I don't think it's necessary for me to bring her. Let's just leave her, forget her one side and focus on me. - Hmm? - Yes sir. - I should focus on you? - I can handle it. You can handle it. Okay. I'll think about it. Thank you sir. Give me a second. I need to take care of something. Wait for me. - [CHUCKLES] - Thank you sir. - Why did you say there's no need of Asabi? - Wale! Look at my new life. Where does she fit? I hope you realize that she made you what you are? - It doesn't matter. - But you know? She doesn't have to be a part of what is going on for me right now. She can make it happen for herself. - See the tribal marks. - What?! Look at me very well. Interesting. "She has tribal marks". You didn't know that before now? You just realized that now. Okay. Before you judge a man, make sure to look back into where he's coming from. So [CLEARS THROAT] Aunty, I'm just making use of the opportunity. I'm just like you. I'm using what I have to get what I need. And no one should be judged for that. Too much talk. [GIGGLES] [GROANS] So I want a drink. You want some? Yeah. Water, please. Okay. Alright. [TUTS] - Ah Sharon! - [SHARON LAUGHS] Your butt is succulent. When you stood up, I was like, "Is this Sharon's butt?" - My darling. - Hmm. First off, I don't understand Yoruba. [IN YORUBA] You understand all I'm saying. All I'm saying is that you are sweet in the middle. Ahh, Sharon. But everybody needs water. I will drink water. [IN ENGLISH] I don't like the fact that you say you can't speak Yoruba because I know you understand me. Drink up. Be Good. Wait a minute. You see that right there? Asiwaju herbs. I need to take that first. You know why? This is what I took, that made me fuck you, your eyelashes flew away. - I have finished you with Asiwaju. - [SHARON LAUGHS] - [GIGGLES] - [OLAJIDE] Ah! - You know what this does? - [CLEARS THROAT] What? - Long lasting, duration, greater me. - [SHARON LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] - You see that beast inside there? - I see that beast, Daddy. - Ask your eyelashes. - [SHARON LAUGHS] - Ooh! - [OLAJIDE] Hmm.

You wiped out my lineage! You are a prodigal child. You are of no benefit to me. [SNIFFS] Okay father. I agree with all you have said. But you left with all your super powers. Why didn't you give me your power? I am ready to fight! I'm ready to revenge! Transfer your powers to me. Asabi, there is power in you. You just did not use it correctly. As you are ready for vengeance, If you summon one herb, two hundred herbs would respond. If you pluck herbs with your right, success is yours. Amen If you pull roots with your left, success shall be yours. Amen. [IN ENGLISH] Jide took the most important part of my life. He keeps taking and taking and taking from everyone.
