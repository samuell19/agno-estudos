DADDY'S GONE A-HUNTING Directed by Frank Borzage Six Acts of Marital Life... Robert! Edith! To see you after such a long time! When I was the age of that young man, I never hesitated before kissing a girl...! I left my parents' home... You know, my only passion is Art... I want to be a painter! All I strive for is a little happiness... and I don't stay long in any place. ...but now that I've met you again, Edith... I notice how I need you. You're mine... I'll never let you go away again. Setting to work was hard until now... But from now on, I'll know of no obstacles! -And some years later...- - Tired? - Yes, tired of the eternal routine... Tired of this bourgeois life... Of these bleak walls... This is what I've been working on for seven years! Yes, the pictures are good... But I'm capable of big things! How I envy those artists who travel abroad... ...looking for new ideas for their creation! But... you could travel abroad for a while? You are right. I'll set off for Paris today... I'll find new vital energies there! (Illegible. Edith's letter?) Oscar, a lively tramp, epitome of the Parisian Bohemia. How long are you intending to work without a break? A man has to consider his physical well-being too. Mrs. Lester You're so patient and obliging... that I really love coming here! Tell me... ?how's your child? Walter Lester Mrs. Fields, this is my son Walter. This is the charming lady I've talked you so much about. It's almost closing time, shall we accompany you home? The negligent and charming Bohemian scene that Robert... thought would be a source of inspiration... Olga... Arousal for men. Scandal for women. In a few months, Robert comes back home with new experience... ...while his wife looks forward to seeing him back. SCHOOL REPORT: Reading "Very Good", Writing "Good", etc. Daddy is coming home! I've come to invite you to spend the next weekend with us in the country. But I'd hate if this humble invitation of ours... disturbed you in such happy hours...! Mommy! It's Daddy! He's coming! Dunno... I guess it's Daddy... Hello... ?Nobody home? Ah, the ghastly wallpaper! My wife, Edith... My friend Oscar. That damn voyage left me crippled! His wife? Really? Poor thing...! He isn't worth much, really... But he's got talent... Mommy, may I go playing downstairs? I'm not hungry... Who are these people, Robert? They're friends of mine. I'll set for two more at table then... Good heaven! You mean eating? At this hour? And now for some music. Where's the piano? We have no piano. You live WITHOUT A PIANO? How come? NO piano!? This place is a grave... And you're eating!? If I'm hungry, no need for music. OK... Having a bite won't hurt us... *(Illegible. A note by Walter Lester?)* What's wrong with you, Robert? I'm back but the love you expected is not, Edith... I prefer to speak frankly. You love another woman...? Good heavens, no! Have you been... faithful to me...? No. I once thought love was the most powerful force in the world... But now I'm not sure anymore... All I can say is I have changed... But I rather don't speak further... Lest I hurt you. Where are you going? No idea. I don't mean you any harm. I rather take a walk. I'll be back later. Sing me a nice song, Mommy... Why did you stop? It's Daddy you're thinking of? When does he come back? Only God knows! "Dear Mrs. Lester... " (illegible) Look how he treats his wife! This man lacks character! -Next afternoon...- How do you do, Edith? Hasn't he changed? He's out and hasn't come back yet. Which one of these you think my mother would like most? Would you mind my keeping it...? Until he comes back...? Perhaps it'd make him think another man is courting me... And so he would reconsider... Can I ask you a huge favor? Would you please kiss me... as soon as he opens the door? Like in the theater...! Water isn't much warm today... Where is Mommy going? Only God knows, darling. "Dear Robert... I'm at the Lesters'. Walter Lester will fetch Janet... "...to bring her here. (Illegible) Edith" Will you come too, Daddy? You already know why I'm here, I suppose? I love your wife and I'll take her from you as soon as I can. If she agrees... my only hope is you make her happy, Lester. Happiness is the thoughest thing. Everybody strives after his own. Disappointment. A wonderful painting... Even if it is so sad! I'll call it "Disappointment". I've always said you have talent! Today you should be the happiest man on Earth! The only person I wanted to see here hasn't come. Just to think I had to kill love to find myself... You're too good to me... But we cannot stay here forever. We won't hear of letting you go! You and your daughter belong here. I've given up my great love, so if you accept... my sincere affection, I'll be your wife. I feel confident she'll get better if no complications set in. Hopefully we can take her back home in a couple of days! Mommy... Where? Where... is Daddy? When... is Daddy... back? I feel so happy! Our fears were unfounded! Not even the pass of time could bring consolation... I cannot stay with you. I must go back to him. I must! For God's sake! Don't pity me... I don't deserve it! Robert! Now we are both alone in the world. We need each other.
