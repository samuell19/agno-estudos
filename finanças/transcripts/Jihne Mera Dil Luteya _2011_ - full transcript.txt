Thank you, Mrs. Randhawa. Thank you so much. In spite of being so busy your husband... ...spares some time for the schooI function. It's quite commendabIe. Not a probIem, sir. It's our pIeasure. TeII me, does Ekam troubIe you a Iot in schooI? Oh, no, no, no. He's such a sweet chiId. He doesn't troubIe us at aII. He has become a favourite of aII teachers. What is it, Mrs. Randhawa? Is there anything speciaI today? You have come earIy to pick up Ekam. Sir, the speciaI thing is that today is my wedding anniversary. Okay. So I thought I shouId take Ekam home earIy today. Oh, it's great. Congrats. Thank you, sir. First we go shopping. Then, we'II go home and make cake. ChocoIate cake. Right? ChocoIate's your favourite, isn't it? Mummy, I want to ask you something. - Yes, Ekam. What is it? How much do you Iove papa? I and your papa Iove each other a Iot. Where did you meet papa? How did you get married? It's a very Iong story. How do I teII you? No, I want to hear the story now. Okay. I'II teII you the story on the way back home. Okay? Yes. TeII me. - ShaII we go now? Let's go. 'The story begins at the viIIage SiaIkot.' 'Two gentIemen of that pIace were very famous.' 'PritpaI Randhawa and Shamsher Randhawa.' 'Once upon a time both the Randhawas were very good friends.' 'But now their friendship had turned into enmity.' 'And aII the viIIagers were fed up of their enmity.' 'One had to aIways do the opposite of what the other said.' 'They aIways kept on fighting.' HeIIo. - HeIIo. HeIIo. - HeIIo. TeII me. - Look, PritpaI and Shamsher are here. Decision wiII be made on what they agree. Decision has been made. Water wiII pass through Kartare's fieIds. How can the water pass through his fieIds? Headman, the decision has been made. Water wiII pass through Kartare's fieIds. I'II see how that happens. 'Both the Randhawas wouIdn't Iet go of any opportunity... ' '... to Iook down upon each other.' 'And both of them had a son.' 'Yuvraj and Gurnur.' Look at this. He scored 28 out of 100 in Punjabi. Your son faiIed. Why do you worry? So what if he faiIed? He scored one mark more than his son. WeII done, son. You have made me happy. It makes no difference to me whether you pass or faiI. But, son, aIways remember one thing. You have to aIways be a step ahead of PritpaI's son. They started incuIcating their enmity in their chiIdren as weII. And they taught them that he shouId never accept defeat... ...from the other one's son. ShaII we go now? But why are you teIIing me the story of these two gentIemen? I don't want to hear this story. I don't want to hear this story, teII me your story. Oh, no. HoId on. I am teIIing you. After some years, they grew up. They became coIIege's dashing, handsome rock stars. We don't pick up a fight without a reason. We bestow our Iives if anyone asks for it with Iove. With Iove. With Iove. We don't pick up a fight without a reason. We bestow our Iives if anyone asks for it with Iove. We enjoy eating and drinking. The worId knows how decent we are. We might Iook simpIe and native. We might Iook simpIe and native. But we are crooked in many ways. Come on. Our enemies Iook down in our presence. Our enemies Iook down in our presence. Nothing is greater than friendship. We don't befriend smokers. We don't. Nothing is greater than friendship. We don't befriend peopIe who show off. We don't endure anyone's taunts. We are ready to do anything for the ones we Iove. We know how to teach a Iesson... We know how to teach a Iesson... ...to the one who tries to act smart. Come on. Our enemies Iook down in our presence. Our enemies Iook down in our presence. So, Yuvraj, how do we deaI with them? One on one or aII in one go? Ask the ones who are about to get thrashed. So, how do we deaI this? ShouId we beat each one of you or aII of you together? How do you want to do it? They are going to get kicked for sure. Whether they get kicked one by one or in a group. Say we'II go one on one. Come one by one. We wiII tear you apart. Betia. - Yes, brother? You go first. Dent their faces. Dent them. Manna Singh. Age wise you shouId go first. Go for it. Oh no. Here comes my tiger. WeII done, buddy. You paid the price for the tattoo on your bicep. Come on, Jaggi. You shouId kick on his chest. Karma, roar. I don't have a Iot of expectations. But I wiII have to send him. Sheera, just go for it. BodybuiIder, he is aII set to touch his feet. WeII done. He's done for. UseIess. Come on. It's your turn now. - It's aII set. Come on, bodybuiIder. It's your turn now. I say I am hot tempered. I fear I might kiII someone. Hey, when wiII you make use of your body? Strip. Fine. Use your triceps. Get this straight. If you don't score, don't come back. Go back to your viIIage. Don't spare him. Fine. Oh, it's not straight. Have courage, dear. Have courage. Your beIoved wiII handIe each one of them. Dinosaur. Did you have to come at my turn? Just a minute. Just a minute. What's the hurry in getting beaten? Let me remove my gIares. They are worth Rs. 2200. Who wiII pay for it if it breaks? I get very angry when I see a weak person Iike you. There's a point. Who bothers about bystanders in a fair? The fight is between the two of them. If you stiII wish to fight with me... ...then ask you Ieader once again. Here you go. I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess... What? You didn't Iike it? ScoundreI, I didn't have any hopes from you. Damn the fearIess. They sometimes use deceit and sometimes touch the feet. Why don't they just give up? Anyway, onIy the two of us are brave in this group. You and me. I have had my turn. Now it's your turn. Go. Go and get even. Now he wants to get kicked. BodybuiIder, he is oIder than me. He won't Iook nice, getting thrashed. Karma, I wiII have to hit him as weII? Looks Iike a bud has been pIucked. Hit him, Gurnur. Hit him. Don't spare him. Hit him, Gurnur. - Don't spare him, Gurnur. - Go for it. Gurnur, hit him. - Uproot him. Break his knees. - Come on. Don't spare him. Hit him. Hit him. We have got hoId of him with great difficuIty. Hit him. Don't Iet him go. - Hit him. Break his knees. - Hit him, Gurnur. Hit him there. - Teach him a Iesson. Don't spare him. - Don't spare him. Break his bones. - Hit him. Hit him. - Break his bones. - Hit him. Hit him. Force him down to the ground. - Hit him. Oh no. Why did the security have to come now? They don't Iet us fight in peace. Move aside, you... I wiII... - Oh no. Wait. Let go of me. Whiskey, my son, such a big car in our viIIage? And P. K. PaIta doesn't know about it? I wiII find out about it right away. Right away. - Let it be, father. Your wretched scooter is nothing in comparison to the Iimousine. You won't be abIe to match up to it. This is not a scooter, it is a jet. It has foIIowed rockets, this Iimousine is nothing. We wiII foIIow it. Watch me. Speed up, father. Let's go, dear. - Speed up, father. Race it, father. Race it. - Go for it. Hurry up. Get to it. Whiskey, I'II go and bait. Father, bait won't heIp here. This fish is very big. Your father, P. K. PaIta can trap the biggest fish. HeIIo. Yes? Have you bought this mansion? Yes. TeII me. MyseIf P. K. PaIta. Property deaIer. PeopIe usuaIIy say that drivers, cops... ...and property deaIers are Iike dogs. But I disagree, sir. Not everyone is the same. God have bIessed me with everything. I make fair deaIs. It's as white as an egg. I tried hard to seII this mansion. Sir, nobody was ready to give Rs. 3 crores for it. I toId the owners that I wiII crack a deaI for Rs. 2.5 crores. Did you buy it for three? I bought it in Rs. 4 crores. Rs. 4 crores? Desires don't have price tags, mister... - What did you say your name was? - PaIta. P. K. Mr. PaIta, my daughter Iiked it and hence I bought it. You said that you are a property deaIer. - Yes. I am Iooking for a piece of Iand for my fertiIizer pIant. Do you have anything in mind? A Iand worth Rs. 1-2 crores is ready, sir. But I want to invest 9 miIIion pounds on this fertiIizer pIant. Let me know if you have something in mind. Yes, Mr. Bajwa. Send those papers to my office. Nine miIIion pounds. I wonder how much it is in rupees. Nine miIIion pounds. Yes, it's a big amount. Why? The empty mansion... In the uphiII area... - Yes. It has been soId. An NRI has come from EngIand. Loaded. He bought it. For Rs. 4 crores. Rs. 4 crores? Nobody was ready to pay Rs. 2.5 crores for it. There's more. He wants to spend 9 miIIion pounds on a fertiIizer pIant. 9 miIIion pounds? There's more. He has a daughter. She's beautifuI. She's as oId as Gurnur. I say if they get married... We wiII be a notch above your neighbour. This is what I pray for to God. Oh, Goddess, get them married. I wiII offer an umbreIIa, made of goId. I'II make him give it. PaIta, your scheme is good. But keep one thing in mind. He shouIdn't know about this. Sir, what are you saying? P. K. PaIta never backed off from his words even when he is drunk. I won't when I am sober. I wiII never go there. WiII you have some tea? Forget the tea, sir. I'm in a hurry. The schooI is after me. I have to get my younger son enroIIed in the schooI. They are asking for Rs. 25,000. I wiII pay it. Mr. PaIta, why are you hesitating? Sir, I hesitate because I stiII owe you some money. Pay it Iater, together. I'II go get it. Here you go, Mr. PaIta. Here's Rs. 25,000. Get your son enroIIed. Fine. My job is done. But keep one thing in mind. My neighbours shouIdn't even get a hint about this NRI scheme. Mr. Randhawa, you shouIdn't have said that. P. K. PaIta never backed off from his words even when he is drunk. I won't when I am sober. I wiII never go to their house. Hey, dad, what's up? Come, dear. Sit down. 'Samosas' (Indian snacks). Dad, so many caIories? Oh, God. Dear, I Ieft the fear of caIories back in EngIand. Now, in Punjab, I want to start my Iife afresh. 'Samosas', 'JaIebis' (Indian sweet), cottage cheese fritters. No, dad. PIease. No thanks. Have them, ma'am. They are way better than your pizzas and burgers. ReaIIy? Thank you. Dear, I have brought you to Punjab... ...but I aIways worry whether you wiII Iike this pIace or not. WeII, dad, you and mom are not going to stay together. So... Whether it's EngIand or Punjab, what difference does it make? I wiII have to get used to it. Right? Forget it. TeII me, how was Noor's first day in coIIege? Not bad. Did you make any new friends? Friends? No, dad. Not as yet. But, I think I wiII soon befriend someone. Friendship? That too with a girI? Dad, you forgot, you are my dad. You shouId stop boys from doing such things. You shouIdn't encourage them. You are strange. What's strange in that, father? This is a Iimit. TeII me if you want someone's bones broken. You are asking me to fIirt with a girI? It's not an easy thing. I know it is not easy. But tiII when wiII you keep fighting smaII battIes? It's time to fight a big battIe. A big one. Son, get this done for me. Daddy, why are you saying such dirty things? I wiII teII mummy about it. Mummy. - No. You know how difficuIt it is to romance with a girI? You know what tantrums they have? I cannot do this. But I can do it on one condition. What's the condition? It wiII cost you Rs. 25,000 a month. Rs. 25,000? Now you wiII charge me for this as weII? Have some shame. Listen, give me a father's discount. Times have changed, father. You must have cajoIed mother with bangIes from the fair. She is an NRI. NRI. One has to feed pizzas and pastas, father. Pizzas and pastas. It wiII cost you. You can have the money. Son, keep one thing in mind. That girI shouId marry you. Hear that. An obedient chiId shouId aIways Iisten to his parents. You have pIeased me. Dad, if it is so, then consider the job done. Print the invites. Noor weds Gurnur. Noor weds Gurnur. It sounds good. WeII done. Okay, father. Learn to taIk in EngIish. You wiII get an NRI daughter-in-Iaw. Even if I have to bring her by force. Excuse me? New admission? Yes. I'm Noor. Hi, I'm Nisha. - Nice to meet you. True. Sister-in-Iaw is very beautifuI. Just Iike Tom Cruise, the one who acts in EngIish movies. Tom Cruise? - Yes. ScoundreI, he is man. The woman. In EngIish movies. She is very beautifuI. Hot. AngeIina JoIie? - Yes. AngeIina DoIIy. You are right, Karma. This is the first time father has put me on a good job. BIess you, father. Gurnur, if you cannot get her then I can try. Anyway, the guy who gets such a beautifuI girI... ...gets a Iot of Iove. And if a monkey Iike you irritates her... ...then she gifts him her sandaIs as weII. Hit him. - Sorry, brother. She is your sister-in-Iaw. A sister-in-Iaw is Iike a mother. Sir is here. Sir is here. - Get your act together. He is here. He is here. - Come on. Keep quiet. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Your sister-in-Iaw is standing, do your knees hurt? Get up. - I am. Come on. - I wish the same. Good morning. Good morning, sir. Brother, first Noor stood up. Then they stood up. Now what do we do? She is standing for no reason. He thinks she is standing for him. I didn't get you, brother. You are there to support me. That's the reason I feeI so brave. Be brave, but don't act Iike human. Come on. Good morning. - Good morning, sir. What is wrong with them? Everyone is standing up? They never stood up for the nationaI anthem. Why did they get up to weIcome me? Sit down. Yes. Who knows about Shakespeare? Now who is he? Is he your uncIe? Is he your uncIe? I knew it. Every one is Iooking down as if they are guiIty of a crime. Shakespeare... - Excuse me, sir. Yes, pIease. WiIIiam Shakespeare was an EngIish poet and pIaywright. He is regarded as one of the greatest writers of the EngIish Ianguage. He's often caIIed the EngIand's nationaI poet... ...and the Bard of Avon. WiIIiam Shakespeare died, ApriI 23rd 1616. Heard your sister-in-Iaw speak in EngIish? Great. Learn something from the girI. She speaks such good EngIish. Get this straight. From tomorrow, in my EngIish Iectures... ...no kid wiII speak in Punjabi. Even if you want to taIk to each other... ...you wiII taIk in EngIish. Then it wouId be better if we don't taIk at aII. Anyway, if I wish to Iearn EngIish... ...how Iong wiII it take for me to Iearn it? If you want to Iearn EngIish? - Yes. To teach someone Iike you EngIish... ...is same Iike tying down a wiId buffaIo. Sir, why don't you use an EngIish idiom for it? In EngIish? - Forget it if you don't know it, sir. No, it's not so. According to me in EngIish it means... ...To make an EngIishman from a Desi... ...is equaI to make siIk sari from jute. Yuvraj, sister-in-Iaw speaks fIuent EngIish. Now what wiII you do? It's a good thing. I was worried. - About what? Who wiII teach our chiIdren? I don't know EngIish. I think your sister-in-Iaw wiII stay at home and teach them. I say, you shouId go right away, hoId her hand... ...and say it in EngIish, Iike I am saying it. - What? I cannot Iive without you. Get Iost. ControI your emotions. As if this is sister-in-Iaw's hand. - Sister-in-Iaw's pet. Then teII her in EngIish. First teII me what I have to say. We... I don't... We... We... ScoundreIs, why don't you say something to him in EngIish? Why shouId I aIone be doing this? It's a different thing that I am better in EngIish than you are. You know more than us for sure. You spend four years in each cIass. We have spent onIy one year. - There is bound to be a difference. - Buddies, agree to it. None of us know EngIish. Yuvraj, you'II have to Iearn EngIish if you wish to have the girI. I'II have to Iearn EngIish. But I am wondering who wiII teach me. Oh, my DoIIy. I Iike meat and you are a vegetarian. As Iong as there is a vesseI on the stove... ...I wiII keep you happy. Temper the chicken. I Iike the taste of bones. Temper the chicken. Mr. BhaIIa, I just tempered spinach, not chicken. Oh, my God. Today again we are having spinach? We had spinach yesterday and the day before that... We have been eating spinach since the Iast six days. When wiII you stop? When my naveI turns green? You don't vaIue spinach's importance. Spinach is the secret to Iawyer Singhara. Beware if you take Singhara's name in front of me again. He's a bad omen. He has been after you since coIIege. Because of him our marriage was pushed back for six years. Otherwise, we wouId have chiIdren... ...screaming and shouting in our house Iong back. You are just too much. - Oh my. The girI is feeIing shy. What shouId I do? DoIIy darIing, I mean to say... DoIIy? Where is she? You? What was your hurry? CouIdn't you come after five minutes? You broke my dream. Good evening, sir. Why take so much troubIe when you don't know EngIish? CouIdn't you just say heIIo? HeIIo. - HeIIo. What brings you here? Sir, I want to Iearn EngIish. You want to Iearn EngIish? - Yes. First Iearn your mother tongue weII. You can tackIe with the other Ianguages Iater. What? I'm not attempting to moIest someone's daughter or sister. I am just saying that I want to Iearn EngIish. Sir, it is very important for me to Iearn EngIish. I know that you are doing this for someone's sister or daughter. It's a different issue that you are doing it through EngIish. No. It's not so. ActuaIIy, I was saying, why don't we taIk about EngIish... ...whiIe drinking EngIish Iiquor, sir? Your case seems simiIar to mine. Singhara and I were behind the same girI in coIIege. Her name was DoIIy. DoIIy. She couIdn't decide which one she shouId choose. Then? Then we brought in the third option. Third option? Who? - Pinky. Pinky? Who Pinky? From Moga. - From Moga? What is that? Pinky from Moga is a girI... ...who has never disappointed anyone. ReaIIy? She seems very generous. We got Singhara drunk and sent him to her. The second day Singhara got dressed... ...and went to propose Pinky. Did Pinky accept it? No. She made a face and said... - What did she say? Brother, I'II think about it and Iet you know tomorrow. Singhara said if you too wiII have to think then... ...it wouId be better that I rather die. Oh no. Great. - Enough of jokes. Today, I make a promise to you. If I don't get you married to Noor then don't caII me Love Guru. But you, too, wiII have to make me a promise. You wiII have to memorise the EngIish I teach you. I'II do that. But teII me, how Iong wiII it take for... ...things to work out between Noor and me. It's not a cot that I can make in an hour. AIways remember... ...it takes time to acquire girIs and mansions. - Okay. If your friendship is your weakest point... ...then you are the strongest person in the worId. In the worId. What say? You didn't Iike it? You think this EngIish wiII be enough for sister-in-Iaw? Yes. This is what the professor said. This is what the professor said. This Iooks Iike a person of Uttar Pradesh speaking in Punjabi. Get Iost. You cannot find a difference between me and them? There is a difference, but on your face and not your tone. I am your professor for the day. Mind your manners in front of me. Karma, I sometimes feeI that the professor... ...drank Iiquor worth Rs. 450 but... ...he is not as great as he cIaims he is. He gave me just a Iine to memorise. I was wondering the same. A person who is singIe at this age... ...how can he teach you how to romanc You are right. We wiII taIk about it Iater. It is 11 o'cIock. Your sister-in-Iaw isn't here as yet. I fear I might forget the Iine. It took me a Iot of time to memorise it. She is here. - Sister-in-Iaw is here. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Give me the book. Move. Oh God, heIp me with the girI. Kids, what I am going to teach you today... Do you know who has said this? I swear I don't know who has said this. I wiII teII you. It's Abraham LincoIn. He says... If your friendship is your weakest point... ...then you are the strongest person in the worId. In the... - WorId. Yes. Got it? - Yes. Yes, what? - Yes, sir. Yes. Now go home and work hard. Make preparations Iike me. Look, I Iearnt EngIish. You wiII Iearn it as weII. Okay? Memorise this and come tomorrow. We wiII meet Iater. Okay? Take care. God has sent Yuvraj Iike an angeI for EngIish for us. We wouIdn't know EngIish if not for him. He spokes such fIuent EngIish... I say, a person Iike us wiII be tongue tied. That's true. Long Iive... - Professor Yuvraj. Long Iive... - Professor Yuvraj. Long Iive... - Professor Yuvraj. I don't understand Yuvraj and I studied together. Pass it to me. Pass it to me. - He cannot speak in EngIish. When did he Iearn EngIish? No probIem. - Get it. Get it. Get it. What does he think? He wiII get cIoser to the girI if he speaks in EngIish? Pass it. Pass it. - I think we, too, wiII have to stop our rounds. We, too, wiII have to Iearn EngIish. Kiddo, we aren't made for Iearning EngIish. We have been trying to Iearn EngIish since the Iast 15 years. We have wrecked our brains over it. Did you get it? - Get the baII. -Then how wiII we get it in 15 days? We manage with Punjabi. This is bad. I cannot understand one thing. Yuvraj and EngIish... What is this aII about? There is a catch, brother. Prof. BhaIIa is giving Yuvraj tuitions in EngIish. Prof. BhaIIa. - Yes. The Sikh has become a traitor. We aIready had onIy a few in hand, now we Iost him as weII. It wiII be difficuIt. - Yes. I have an idea. BodybuiIder, you too get ideas? I have a neighbour, a Iawyer caIIed Singhara. He can heIp us. We haven't kiIIed a person that we need a Iawyer. Stupid, this is a matter of the heart. A matter of heart. BhaIIa and Singhara were in the same coIIege. And they were after the same girI. The girI's name was DoIIy. She went to UK. Now both of them hate each other. BhaIIa and Singhara. And in between them is DoIIy. BodybuiIder, teII me something. - What? Why do girIs make boys fight? - True. Singhara. Now you are aII we have. WonderfuI. WonderfuI. WonderfuI. What are you Iooking at, Mr. Singhara? Ms. DoIIy, I feeI God made you at Ieisure. Otherwise, how can anyone be so beautifuI? Mr. Singhara, you are too much. You keep praising me for no reason. My Iove, I kept Ioitering in coIIege for four years for you. I tried to teII you something. I couIdn't teII you. I didn't have the courage. Then muster courage and teII me today. DoIIy, if I couIdn't teII you in four years... ...how do I say it right away? Oh no, Mr. Singhara. Does anyone take this Iong to express his feeIings? Say it today. Idea. I wiII cIose my eyes. You say, one, two, three. And then I wiII say, DoIIy, I Iove you. Start now. One. Two. Three. - I Iove you, my Iife. DoIIy, I Iove you. I Iove you, my Iife. DoIIy, I Iove you. I Iove you too. So? You were romancing DoIIy? Who are you? - Sir, I am Gurnur. What's your case? - I Iike a girI. And her parents don't approve of you? No, I wiII handIe her parents. - So, your parents disapprove? - My father is aIso ready. In fact, my father has made me go after the girI. The girI doesn't agree. I am not into the business of convincing girI. I am not running a marriage bureau. Get going. Look, sir, I had come here with a Iot of hopes. Son, I am not at aII concerned with your hopes. I wouId have heIped you if you wouId've brought me a case. Get going. WeII, Gurnur Singh, if Yuvraj has Prof. BhaIIa's support... ...then you have God's support. Okay. Bye. Just a minute, son. Just a minute. TeII me, what does it have to do with Prof. BhaIIa. Prof. BhaIIa. - Yes. ActuaIIy a roguish boy studies in our coIIege. - Okay. Yuvraj. - Okay. - He is eIder than me. He is after the girI. And Prof. BhaIIa is heIping him. Both of them are trying to trap the girI. I Iove her. Poor girI. Prof. BhaIIa is a very dangerous man. I know him since he used to run around in knickers. He did something simiIar with me. - ReaIIy? He aIways interferes in a Iove story. - Okay. Don't worry, son. You have come to the right pIace. If he has Prof. BhaIIa... - Yes. Then you have Advocate Singhara with you. Sir, now you are my onIy support. Such a reIief that the job got done today. - True. You know peopIe here are so heIpfuI. WiII the idea work? Don't ask too many questions. Get to work. Come on. Get going. Okay, brother. - Your sister-in-Iaw is here. Be carefuI. Go. Go. You must be feeIing very odd in Punjab. Punjab is not the same as UK. No, I Iike this pIace. ActuaIIy, I shouId be thankfuI to dad as he brought me here. Oh, my God. That reminds me I have to hurry back home. He wanted to introduce me to someone. I have to go. See you tomorrow. Okay? - Okay, bye. - Bye. Oh, my God. How did it get punctured? I am aIready Iate. What do I do now? Madam, pIease move aside. Oh, no. Oh, God. Watch out, madam. So, you kept the books? - Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, brother. - Fine. Go. BIess you. Brother, you are aII we have. - I am bIessed. Come on. Come on. Get going. - Bye, brother. - Bye. He is an angeI. SickIes Iost their sharpness. Adversities turned back. Not even a drop of water... Not even a drop of water went in... Oh, God. Oh, God. Got a fIat tyre? Hear that. This is the probIem with expensive things. They deceive you at the wrong time. Excuse me? The tyre got punctured? Hear that. The coIIege is aIso over. You won't find a mechanic to fix it. If you want, I can drop you somewhere. No, it's okay. I'II manage. How wiII you manage? I think you didn't recognise me. We are in the same cIass. I sit two benches behind you. Where do you want to go? TeII me. No, it's okay. I don't want to bother you. It wiII not at aII bother me. Come with me. I'II drop you. Where do you want to go?

Everyone in the coIIege knows about it. It's a match made in heaven. It is a very good pair. - Good? WeII done, Gurnur. You did a great job with the tuition scheme. Yuvraj wiII be stunned. And we wiII win the game. Yuvraj and everyone eIse is my pupiI. Now how do I praise myseIf? You are right, brother. I mean it's an epic pair. What does that mean? Like Heer and Ranjha. - Understood. - Got it? Heer and Ranjha. Proper, right? There's Ranjha of Pinky from Moga. Come. Noor, Gurnur. Oh, God. Oh, God. Marriages are made in heaven.

Right. - Pinky from Moga. Pinky from Moga? - Yes. Pinky from Moga. So what? I toId her. Noor is my future wife. I mean it's a famiIy matter.

Who is Pinky? Now what do we say, brother? Is Pinky your sister-in-Iaw? Who is Pinky? Brother, sorry. - Who is Pinky? How is that possibIe? My tricks have never faiIed. You teII me in detaiI. What detaiIs do I teII you, sir? I just got ruined. He got me engaged to Pinky. Pinky. Pinky. From Moga? - From Moga. Who is Pinky from Moga, sir? I wiII teII you when the time is right. By the way, BhaIIa has made a nice move. Pinky. From Moga. TeII me something. - Yes? How wiII you feeI if you get a chance to give Noor a tight huge? Sir, it wiII be Iike the cat getting a mouse... ...uncIe meeting aunt, Ranjha getting Heer... ...and a starved person getting 'Kheer'(Indian sweet). It wiII be great. Then do one thing. - Yes? Don't go to coIIege tomorrow. Don't' go to coIIege. First you taIk about hugging her then you say don't go to coIIege. Go to coIIege day after tomorrow... ...and give Noor a tight hug. She is a smart girI. I wiII get thrashed. You won't get thrashed. You wiII get a hug. A hug. Sure? - Yes. I won't get thrashed. - No. Sure? - Yes. - BIess you, sir. - He is very famous. It's hard to be separated from brother ChamkiIa. You shouIdn't betray your friends. Why don't I see the anti-party in coIIege today? Have we reaIIy swashed them out? You have naiIed it. I say, we wiII have a Iot of fun then. I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess. - Sit down. He acts Iike SaIman Khan. He puts now gIasses in front and one at the back. He ruined my pose. I was confident that today I wouId sureIy get some this coIIege. - She is coming. She is coming. - Where is she? Your cIasses started? - I think your sister-in-Iaw is aIso with her. I am taIking about your sister-in-Iaw. Shut up. Stop taIking about sisters-in-Iaw. Get out. Bye. Take care. - Pick up the spares, driver. Bye. See you Iater. - You might Iose one of them. Go for it. - Go from there. Go from that side. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? What is it? Why are you aIone today? Where are your students? Students? I am just coming after teaching them. I was thinking if I find a friend I wiII go for a cup of coffee. - Friend? - Yes. - Where is Gurnur? You know him. He must have gone to have coffee with his Pinky. Oh, so sad. WeII, Yuvraj, I cannot take Gurnur's pIace in your Iife. Fine. If Gurnur is not here then make do with Noor today. Make do? What are you saying? There is no comparison. Open the door and get in, dear. Okay. - And yes... - Yes? Dust your shoes before you get in, dear. This car is Ioved by its owner. Keep it here, Chotu. Keep it here, Chotu. Yes. Just a minute. I think we shouId forget the coffee and have tea. Chotu, get two cups of tea. Why? What happened? Why tea? ActuaIIy, I have had coffee with 2-3 girIs. - Yes? As soon as the coffee got over they proposed me. ReaIIy? They had to propose you. It's not easy to find an educated boy Iike you. Educated? There are a Iot of educated boys around. This is the onIy quaIity you found in me? No. I mean educated... Yes, kind-hearted. Kind-hearted. Even BhoIa in the canteen is kind-hearted. TeII me more. Okay. Educated, kind-hearted, good Iooking, handsome, smart... ...inteIIigent and better than everybody eIse. Okay? I cannot praise you more than that. Okay? It's okay. Just a second. Sorry. HeIIo. I Iost it. I Iost my heart. I was Ieft with nothing. I Iost it. I Iost my heart. I was Ieft with nothing. Her eyes kiIIed me. Her eyes kiIIed me. Now there is no way I am going to survive. The one with cat eyes, your eyes are creating havoc. Your eyes are creating havoc. The one with cat eyes, your eyes are creating havoc. Your eyes are creating havoc. My innocent heart got trapped. It got trapped. It deceived me and started beIonging to you. It started beIonging to you. My innocent heart got trapped. It deceived me and started beIonging to you.

The one with cat eyes, your eyes are creating havoc. Your eyes are creating havoc. The one with cat eyes, your eyes are creating havoc. Your eyes are creating havoc. But, sir, I didn't understand one thing. - What? Why do you wish to Ieave Birmingham, London and Iive here? ActuaIIy, Mr. PaIta, I never Iiked that pIace. That's why eIders rightIy say that there is no pIace such as home. Chotu, see who's at the door. I'II go and check, sir. I'II go and check. It's just Iike my own house. HeIIo, sir. Yes, teII me, who do you wish to meet? Oh no. You... HeIIo, sir. PaIta, what are you doing here? I have set the bait for you. - ReaIIy? The fish is about to get trapped. Come in, sir. Come in. Okay. - Come in. This way. This way. He is Mr. Randhawa. Our neighbour. HeIIo. - HeIIo. Come, have a seat. I thought an NRI has come in my neighbourhood. I have a duty to serve him. You might need something. Thanks. My bungaIow is right there. Look, Mr. Bajwa, Iook at fate. We are neighbours and our chiIdren study together. Oh, so your son too studies in Noor's coIIege? Yes. - In the same cIass. I'II go and check. Now it is my house. Hey... PaIta, you, over here? You were setting things right for me. Stuck between the deviI and the deep bIue sea. Now onIy you can heIp me, God. Has the fish taken the bait? Now the fish wiII get confused as to which bait it shouId take. Confuse? I mean the fish is a IittIe heavy. It wiII take some time to take the bait. Mr. PaIta, who is at the door? Let's go. He is caIIing us. Let's go. Come in. - HeIIo. I am PritpaI. Your neighbour. You are new here. You are an NRI. It is my duty to enquire your weIIbeing. You can approach me without hesitation if you need anything. Come, have a seat. What a coincidence. Mr. Randhawa just came here. It's great. Today, both my neighbours have come here at the same time. I am sure you both know each other. Very weII. They used to pIay together. Saw, Mr. PaIta, you were asking me... ...why I Ieft EngIand and came to Punjab. This is our Punjab. Look, here neighbours Iive Iike reIatives. They are Iike bread and butter. Noor, I wish I, too, had a girI Iike Pinky in my Iife. Who Pinky? Pinky from Moga. Oh, God. Pinky from Moga. - Yes. WeII, you know what, there is someone made for everyone. And I am sure, Yuvraj, you too wiII find a nice girI. Nice girI? Right. I mean someone Iike you... Like I... I mean we... - Gurnur. Hi. Okay. - He is here. I cannot taIk to her now. What happened? You don't have a Iecture? Show off ruined everything. - HeIIo. Why is he making faces? Hey, Gurnur. Gurnur, what happened? Gurnur, why are you so sad? I think he is pretending. I think he wiII start crying. - Gurnur... There he goes. - Gurnur, wiII you teII me what's wrong? He is going for the kiII. Oh damn! What's wrong? What happened? - Let go. Why are you hugging her? What happened? TeII us what happened. - Gurnur... BIoody Ieech. You keep on hugging her. TeII us what happened. She Ieft me, my friend. Who? Pinky. - Oh, my God. - Pinky? - Who Pinky? From Moga. From Moga? But she is... I don't know what girIs want. The same thing that is happening... ...with every boy in Punjab happened to me as weII. Pinky got a marriage proposaI from London and she Ieft me. But didn't you try to stop her? I toId her... - What? Live a Iong and a happy Iife. May God bIess you with a son. Oh, God. But I wonder what girIs want. Is money and being an NRI everything? Doesn't true Iove have any vaIue? No, Gurnur. Don't worry, okay? You don't need to cry over such a girI. Now you cheer up. Today we won't attend any Iectures. We wiII go out together and have Iunch. Okay? Now smiIe. Both of us? - Yes. Okay. - No. We. By we she means we. Come on. Let's go. - We have to take him with us? - Let's go. - I am aIso taking you with me, you idiot. You wiII ruin the scenario. - Stop it now, guys. Don't fight. Brother, Iook over there. Those juniors are going away with your girI. Okay. They are trying to steaI my girI? Not a probIem, kiddo. Don't worry. She wiII be coming to me in the end. Why do you guys Iook serious. It's good news. I just Iove ItaIian food. It's my favourite. Pasta, pizza. Me too. - Same here. ReaIIy? - Same here. - Hear that. That's great. We three have simiIar tastes. Very simiIar. - You know what? I thought peopIe of Punjab onIy Iike stuffed fIatbreads. Stuffed fIatbreads? What are you saying? My mother serves me pasta with my morning tea. I eat pizza and garIic bread everyday. I eat pizza and garIic bread everyday. This is what I eat. - Thank God. Yes. - Your mood changed. I got scared, you know that? Noor, you know what I feeI? I feeI I wasn't destined to have Pinky's Iove. I see. I feeI God has sent Noor... I mean God has sent someone eIse for me. Hey, are you out of your mind? What are you saying? You suffered from heartbreak just yesterday. You shouIdn't think about another girI for another 2-2? years. Listen to Davinder Kohinoor's songs. Think about Pinky's memories aII the time. Forget it. - Yuvraj, Iet bygones be bygones. Why is the use of thinking about it? Davinder Kohinoor. Guys, at Ieast have the pizza. WiII I be abIe to swaIIow it now? And pIease, teII me something. Why does one get married? How do I teII why a person gets married? Fun. - FroIic. Pizza. Pizza. I mean one gets married so that... ...the new reIation brings happiness? - Yes, of course. But if the same reIation beings probIems and tensions in Iife... ...then what is the use of getting married? I don't understand. Eat the pizza. - You have it. My mom and dad have been married for 23 years. But sIowIy they started getting away from each other. SIowIy they got so far away from each other... ...that mom stayed back in UK... ...and dad came to Punjab with me. Now if 23 years cannot keep a reIationship together... ...then what is the use of forming such a reIationship? But, Noor, everyone has to get married someday. No. It's not necessary. You mean you wiII never get married? - No. We are unnecessariIy trying to tear each other apart. She is saying that she doesn't want to get married. You know something? I have a Iot of exampIes of successfuI marriages. Yes. - Amitabh Bachchan. - The taII guy. Shah Rukh Khan. - Right. And Sachin TenduIkar. Dharmendra. - Yes. He has married twice. He is having fun. - Yes. He is not facing any probIem. He is handIing two women. TeII me about a common man... There are many. who is happy after getting married. Common man. That... No one. Right. That's why I have decided that I won't get married. Oh. Guys, I am getting Iate. Enjoy the pizza. See you Iater. Bye. What is this mess? Forget it. Get stuffed potato fIatbreads. Have the coId drink. - Yes. You paid for it? Why? Why shouId I pay for it? I am heartbroken, buddy. If you are heartbroken then why are you having a coId drink? Pinky from Moga. Cheers. DoIIy. Don't stop me from drinking today. Because I want to teII you something very big today. What? Look, DoIIy, there were onIy two ways... ...in which I couId Iive my Iife with you. What are those? You didn't know one way and I didn't know the other. But we are stiII Iiving our Iives... ...and having fun. It was fun Iiving Iife with you. I aIways pray to God that I shouId get DoIIy in every Iifetime. I shouId get onIy DoIIy. Ms. DoIIy, I don't understand how can peopIe... ...Iive their Iives in iIIusion. I stiII remember the day when we were about... ...to have our coIIege vacation. AII the students were going home. You caIIed me in the Iibrary. I was feeIing a IittIe shy. Before Ieaving you Iooked into my eyes and said... ...My darIing, may God be with you. Let it be. - Right then the fatso Singhara aIso came there. He said, Ms. DoIIy, say something about me as weII. And you said, My darIing, may you prosper. May I never Iie, DoIIy. If BhaIIa wouIdn't have come in the way... ...then I swear our eIdest chiId wouId have been as oId as Gurnur. And our chiId wouId have been Iike Yuvraj. Like Gurnur. Like Yuvraj. I said, Iike Gurnur. I said, Iike Yuvraj. Like Gurnur. - Like Yuvraj. Lawyer, what court are you attending here so Iate in the night? Professor, what are you Iecturing on over here? I was with DoIIy... Mr. Singhara, tiII when wiII we make DoIIy come in our dreams? Mr. BhaIIa, I have decided... - Decided? I wouIdn't Iet the injustice that happened with me... ...in Iife happen with Gurnur. I wiII get him married to Noor. But, Mr. Singhara, don't forget... ...it takes time to acquire girIs and mansions. Gurnur wiII marry Noor onIy if Noor agrees to get married. She hates marriages. Do one thing. You taIk to Yuvraj and I wiII taIk to Gurnur. That both of them together shouId taIk to Noor... ...and convince her that marriage is not such a bad thing. I think I wiII have to taIk about it. Otherwise, they two wiII keep fighting over Noor... ...and someone eIse wiII whisk Noor away. Son... If you want to progress in Iife then... ...you shouId focus on three things in Iife. FirstIy focus on Bajwa's daughter Noor. You have to trap her and get married to her. SecondIy focus on Bajwa's Iand and property. And the third point... Papa, if you don't mind, doesn't everybody have onIy two eyes? Papa. You took it seriousIy. Fatso didn't come. If he finds a girI, I think he wiII take her somewhere. This is how he is. - Yes. He is here. - They are here. Here you go, friends. He is Surinder. And she is KamaI. They are students of theatre department in the university. They wiII do as you say. Sir, have you ever got married? - No. Why if we get you married for a day? With her? No, with this fatso. WiII he do? Do you Iike him? ScoundreI, we wiII get you married to a girI. Fine. - If you get caught I wiII get you divorced... ...even before you get married. There is no chance of getting caught, brother. I say, I wiII disguise them in such a way... ...that no one wiII recognise them. - ShaII we make the preparations? - Let's go. Come. Sir, you have act. WiII you be abIe to do it? Okay. - Do you think they wiII be abIe to do it? The guy Iooks smart. And the girI? - GirIs are aIways naughty. ScoundreI. Don't goof up. Everything shouId go weII. Best of Iuck. She is here. - Don't worry, brother. We wiII do our best. Hey, guys. What's up? - Good. Good. Have a seat. Have a seat. I am fine. Okay. So teII me, why did you caII me here? TeII her. Meet them. They are our friends Surinder and KamaI. Say heIIo. - HeIIo. - HeIIo. HeIIo. - Look, brother has been married since the Iast three years. I mean three years. They never fight. They aIways Iive Iike brother and sister. They never fight. They Iove each other a Iot. What eIse do I teII you? They have been married for three years? And they have never fought? I mean I find that kind of strange. It's very simpIe. Whatever I say... - She agrees to it. And whatever I say... - Our brother accepts it. There is no reason to fight. TeII me. Okay. What if you both Iike different things? I Iove you. - What? I Iove you. They Iove each other a Iot. They are our best coupIe. - Okay. Okay. That's great, guys. Yes, it's great. It seems Iike just yesterday... ...when we danced at their wedding. TeII her. - We drank a Iot. Remember how much we vomited? Right? - What? I mean the coId drink. We drank coke. What say? Now do you agree that... ...even a common man can get married and be happy? Great. - Yes. Okay, guys. Both of you won, I Iost. Okay? Excuse me. I think it worked out. - Our job is done. HeIIo. Noor, it's Karanveer. Hi. - I have caIIed to inform you that the husband and wife... ...which Gurnur and Yuvraj have brought before you... ...are rented artists. They are fakes. To fooI you. This is what they do. The rest depends on you. Whether you wish to trust them or not. This is what they do with every girI. I am teIIing you about this because our famiIies are reIated. I think now she wiII take it seriousIy. - Everything okay? - Now do you feeI that marriage is a bad thing? A dream pair. - Now what's wrong with her? - Noor? At Ieast teII me what's wrong. - Oh God, pIease. What happened? - What happened? WiII both of you get out of my way, pIease? What happened? Now shouId I teII you what happened? What do you want to prove by getting rented actors... ...to pose at husband and wife? God. I thought of you to be a good friend. But you... But, Noor, we did aII this to change your mind. And just because your parents don't stay together... ...no one shouId get married? And I... - Don't you dare. You have no right to say anything about my parents. Okay? It must be a smaII thing for you. But it's not so for me. I have been seeing them fighting since I was a chiId. I saw them separating. I saw a marriage getting over. And this wasn't a joke for me.
