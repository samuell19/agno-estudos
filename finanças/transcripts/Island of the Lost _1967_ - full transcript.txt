Come on, Drip, move! Come, Drip. Yes. It's only a little wet. Oh, no! All of this was supposed to be off the record until we sailed! We'll just have to shift our moorings right now. I'll warm her up, stand by to cast off. But Dad, why? That story will have every crackpot, every would-be-adventurer descending on us wanting to sign on. Ahoy, The Quest! See what I mean? Permission to come aboard? Sorry, no. You are Dr. Josh MacRae, aren't you? Yes, I am. But I'm afraid you misunderstood that newspaper account. Our crew is complete. Now that I'm here, I suppose it is. Maybe you'd better read this. It's from Dr. Duncan. He's been taken ill. That's right, so he asked me to come and take his place. You? Oh, now I know where I've seen you before. You're that football player who's doing graduate work with Dr. Duncan. La, La, La... Larsen! Gabe Larsen, and let's say that I'm a graduate student who plays a little football. A little? Dad, he's the number one draft choice. I mean, he just signed one of the biggest pro football contracts there ever was. Oh, that's what we need. Now hold on a minute, Dr. MacRae. I'm a trained anthropologist, the only reason I signed that contract was to pay for the rest of my education. And if Dr. Duncan didn't believe in my qualifications, he wouldn't have sent me. Duncan may know what you can do, Larsen, but I don't. Well there's only one way to find out, isn't there? Shall I come aboard? Come aboard, Mr. Larsen. Stu, show Mr. Larsen where he can stow his gear. Sure, Dad. This way, Mr. Larsen. Hey, call me Gabe, huh? Really? Okay, Gabe. Hey gang, this is Gabe Larsen. This is Judy. Hi. - Hi. - And that's my sister Sharon. Well, hi. Hello. And this is Liz. - Hello. - Hi! Hey if you're an anthropologist too, hungy! Hungy? Oh, a traditional greeting of the south sea. And that's Drip! Dad, isn't he wonderful? Well I mean, I think he'll work out just fine, don't you? Well, no. But then I'm not exactly a pretty young girl. Sharon, one thing has to be clear. Especially now that Dr. Duncan has sent us this young muscle man in his place. The Quest is going on a scientific expedition. A serious one, and you know how much this means to me. I know. Then you have to keep that in mind, Sharon. I want to make sure that young Mr. Larsen doesn't regard this trip as a pleasure cruise between football games. All right, below there, hit the deck! We're movin' out! We're now 26 days out of Honolulu. Course, south, south-east. I recently proposed the scientific theory that has aroused only skepticism. I believe there's a chain of undiscovered islands in the. South Pacific in an area below the Tuamotu Archipelago. I think there's no other explanation for certain migration of the early Polynesians, except that such islands exist and were used by them as stepping stones to the mainland. I risk reputation and every cent I have in this expedition. I mean to locate these lost islands, not only to confound my critics, but because I suspect that we may find links with the past that would astonish the scientific world. Drippy, Drippy! Drip! Hi, what do you got? Take a look. Hm, looks like plankton. Is it? Yeah. It certainly does. You know something? What? You're a lot prettier than plankton. Am I? What's wrong? Gabe, this whole expedition, well, it's a very serious thing. My dad's risking a lot, and I just don't wanna see anything stand in its way. Aw relax, Sharon, nothing's going to. We're just gonna have a nice pleasant cruise and go back to Hawaii. Oh, well then um, you don't believe in my dad's theories either then, hm? No, I guess I don't. Sharon, he has nothing to back them up. Nothing but a lot of ideas, a lot of guess-work. A real scientific theory needs a lot more than that. That's right, Mr. Larsen. That's why we're on this voyage, isn't it? To take out the guess-work. There's only one difference. I know I'm right. I'll be needing you both on deck. Well, I guess I fumbled that one. You could say that Dad scored the first down. And whose side are you on? Both. Well as long as I'm still in the ball game. Now don't go too far, Sharon, the wind's beginning to pick up. Okay, Dad, I won't. And watch out for anything strange. If my calculations are right we're nearing the unknown area. Here, Sharon. Dr. MacRae says his family is half-fish. I suppose your family is half-fish too. I suppose they would be if I had a family. I'm an orphan, I don't really know who I am. You're Judy Hawllani. Hawllani comes from the family who took me in, and I got the Judy because the name was vacant in an orphan school. Vacant? There was nobody there by that name, so I took it. Maybe that's why I want to be an anthropologist, because anthropology tells us who we are. Well I bet you find out you're a Hawaiian princess. Dad. Have you ever seen a shark with nine gills? No. I don't know anyone else who's ever seen one either. Well I just did. No, honey, you couldn't have. There's no such thing. Oh there might have been thousands of years ago, but uh, there's no shark like that alive today. Dad, I was close to them, I counted them. Those sharks had nine gills! You could have counted wrong. Come on now, let's see if we can get this boat moving. Nine gills. Hey, Gabe, look at this. It jumps around and then points east. I checked it with the sun and it doesn't seem right. Now I don't know how to read it. What's happening? I don't know. Doctor? There's some kind of a magnetic disturbance in this area. I suppose that's the reason everyone steered clear of it all this time. Look at that compass. What would happen if we stayed in the magnetic disturbance and didn't try to go around it? Where would it lead us? I'll take it, Stu. What are you gonna do? We're gonna home in on it. That needle is gonna lead us right to our destination. Land-ho! An island! Take it, Gabe. Look at the chart, any island there? No, there's nothing for 800 miles. But there it is. We'll get there before dark, gives us a chance to sound our way in and find some place to drop the hook for the night. We'll go ashore first thing in the morning. While the crew celebrates, my mind is on the morning. This island has been isolated from civilization perhaps for centuries. Will we find a new species of plant and animal life, or traces of an ancient Polynesian culture? Now Stu, you and Judy... What's that? Some kind of volcanic action. This whole island must have built up over a submerged volcano. What a fantastic thing. The island could be riddled with pockets of this stuff. Look, you girls go back to the beach and, don't go wandering about. Well, Mr. Larsen, you come with Stu and me and we'll take a look around. It's not gonna blow up, is it? I don't think so, but watch your step, all of you. Well, there's your proof, Dad. Man did live on this island. That's no ancient skeleton. You're right, that fellow was alive not very long ago. Dad, there's another one over there. It's another young male. He must have crawled into those roots for some reason. For protection from, something? Yeah. What? Judy, I'm going out a little way. Remember what your dad said. I'll be careful. You look sick! I'll be right back! Judy, Judy! Come quick! There's a man, he's hurt! A man? Who? I don't know! Come on! Can you help? I don't know. Bad. Looks like something poisonous hit him. I've never seen anything like it. Or like him. What's he saying? It's a very ancient dialect, almost like Tahitian. He's asking for help. Tahini sister. - What does he want? - He thinks I'm his sister. Bringing him medicine from the berries. Berries aren't medicine. No. But we'll try it. Wait 'til Dad sees this. Dad, look! They look like some kind of an ostrich. Yeah, the kind no one's ever seen before. They're an unknown species. A whole separate line of evolution. They're eating their kill. Dad, over there. The smell of blood, that's what's bringing them. Up that tree, quick. Look. Gosh! I didn't think berries could do that. They must contain some natural antibiotic. What's he saying? Something about being some kind of king. He says it's taboo that we, Liz, we'd better go. Come on. Your belts, take off your belts! Hey, look over there! What kind of hyenas are those? They're more like saber-toothed wolves. There are things on this island we all thought were completely extinct. Let's get back to the beach. There it is, now I don't think I've left anything out. It's fantastic. You know, this island is the greatest archaeological discovery since the tomb of King Tut. Dad, what does it mean? It's a story, Liz, about a test of endurance. See, they bring the young man to the island, then they leave him alone to survive. And on this island that's not too easy. And then after he's passed the test, they take him back again. Then the man I helped, he must be the one they're testing. Judy, what did the young man call himself? Oh it was in the old language but I think he said king. Well that's it, Stu. This is the way these people select their kings. But he said he was taboo. Don't you worry, honey. Sharon, it's a wonderful job you did. Now off you go to bed, honey. Night. Night. I didn't wanna frighten Liz, but there's something important we should all be aware of. - What's that, Dad? - The taboo. Judy and Liz broke it. That can mean many things, dangerous things. So from now on, I want you to be even more careful. Okay? Goodnight. Goodnight, Dad. Tomorrow we'll search the island, I wanna find that young man and give him whatever help we can. Hey! Oughtn't you to be in bed? What's the matter, Liz? I don't know, I couldn't sleep. I'm worried, I guess. I know, honey. Dad, I was wondering. If those animals you saw today are so strange and so mean, well, couldn't there be other animals we don't even know about? I mean, more horrible ones. And maybe other people, even more weird than the animals. Now wait a minute, what are you trying to do, scare yourself out of a good night's sleep? Dad, there could a lot of other islands, with all sorts of strange people and animals we never even thought about. Well, one island is plenty for me this evening. Now, give me a kiss. Now off you go to bed. Goodnight. I guess Tupuna's medicine must have worked. Yeah, there's no sign of him. Gabe! They look like head hunters. They must have seen our ship. - We'd better get back onboard. - Wait a minute. You just stay hidden, I'll decoy them. It'll give you time to warn the others. Ah-ha! Quiet, Drip! Come on. But Stu, there's no tank for you. I'll buddy-breathe, let's just hope there's enough air. - Where are the girls? - They're underwater. Stu got them overboard in their scuba gear. There's only one place they've tried one, it's the grotto. Come on. Oh. Typhoon. That thing looks far away, but it'll be here in minutes. Well then anyone who's in the grotto will be killed. They should be here by now. Well are you sure they're coming here? Maybe they saw you on the beach. I know you all want to rest, but we have to get out of here, there's a typhoon heading for the island. Why don't we just stay here? It's safe and it's dry. Because that storm will have huge waves running in front of it, almost tidal waves. The only safe place is in-land. Let's head for the palm grove, come on. This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse! Gabe, bring up the rear with Stu! I'll take the lead with Liz. Stick together and don't get lost! I'm gonna try and find the others! I'll be back soon, honey! Pull yourself to a tree! Use vines, anything! Is she badly hurt? No, I don't think so. - Where's Judy? - I thought she was with you! Let me find her! You can't find her in all this! And when I came to, I was in a cave, alone and safe. It must have been Tupuna. Dad! - Dad, the boat! - It's gone! It disappeared. She must have sunk. Gone? We're gonna die, aren't we, Daddy? With the ship gone, we haven't got anything. No. No, we're not gonna die. No matter what we've lost. No matter what dangers are on this island, we're not going to die. Sure. Came here to study anthropology. Instead we're gonna live it. We have as much to start with as my first ancestors. We'll make a life here. We'll find food first, then fire, shelter, tools, weapons. We'll survive, honey. Come on, don't just stand there, we've got work to do! The ship's nowhere. Right now we need food, shelter. The first thing is protection, that's why I want to have fire and fast. Dad, look. Liz, you stay right here. But, Dad! Keep it going, Judy! If the spears won't keep them off, fire might. Good girl, now light those torches! Quickly! Okay. Now, we need shelter for the night. Somewhere those beasts can rush us in the dark. Judy, that cave you found. Tupuna's cave? He'll never share it with us. Come on, let's go. The sun's going down fast. The cave's just over there, I'm sure. - Is Tupuna in there? - No, he's not. Okay quickly, gather up that wood. First job for everyone is to keep a fire going close to the cave, but nobody does anything alone, we work in pairs. Gabe, could you rig up some kind of an alarm system. A druid strung on vines, anything that'll make a noise. Right. Judy! Where are you going? To find Tupuna. Let me try to tell him that we mean him no harm. You stay right here. Dad, what do we do if Tupuna comes back? Try to make peace with him. If we can't, we'll fight. We feast tonight, wild roast duck stuffed with shellfish. We owe ourselves a celebration. Did you say celebration? Wait right here, man. This is our house-warming. We've solved all out immediate problems. Now we start to think about the next step. A boat. A boat, big enough to carry all of us back home. And everything we've collected, all our specimens? Sure! The world has to know about what we've discovered here. It's of tremendous importance. New plants, new animals, even new people. And what's more, Dad, we got a whole new sound. You ready? Okay. Come on, girls! Here, Judy, let me help you. Judy. Tupuna's out there, somewhere, isn't he, right now. Watching us. You feel it too. We're secure here now. It's time to see if we can make peace with him. I will prepare for an invited one. Stu. Dad! Wow, he scared me. Dad, what does it mean? Very old meaning. Yes, that it is. We hit something immovable. We go down. We rise toward the heaven. The death sign. The rope, what does the rope mean? The rope is a primitive calendar. You untie a knot for each day that passes. When the last knot is untied, time's run out. We might as well all know where we stand. Sharon, remember that day's relief. That rope calendar was there too. That's right. Then, we've broken a taboo by saving Tupuna. Maybe even by being on this island. He was trying to tell us that when his people come back, they'll kill us. All of us. What about Tupuna? They won't spare him. The taboo works both ways. In their eyes, he's just as guilty as we are, because he should have killed us. That rope didn't look like it had many knots in it. No. But we're not just gonna sit around here waiting for the last knot to come untied. I figure that a sea going out rigger designed like this would be big enough to carry all of us 1,000 miles if necessary, anywhere away from this island. Do you realize the size of this job? What makes you think you can possibly have this thing ready by the time the visiting team shows up? Because if we don't, then the visiting team is going to uh, mop us up. Well we haven't got much time, you know. Exactly, Mr. Larsen. So I suggest you put some of those muscles to work. Professor, you would have made a great coach. Look out! It's Tupuna! Run. He could have killed Liz or Judy. He could have but he didn't, he probably... Well we can't go on wondering when he'll attack next. We'll have to go out to him. Okay, Gabe, let's load up. Stu, you stay here and guard the girls. Dr. MacRae, please. Judy, we'll try to catch him without hurting him. But if he gives us no other choice than to kill him, we'll have to do it. This is where Stu and the girls were. Tupuna must have been up there. There he is! Those things were too darn close. We've gotta find Tupuna. Yeah, well that's gonna be a lot harder than you thought. We can't just have him running around loose on the island. It's some kind of tarantula. Did he get you? He got me, but good. That thing really packs a wallop. Let me see. Drain the poison out. Gotta drain the poison out. Well let's get you somewhere safe away from those ostriches first, come on. Dad, you've got to drink this berry juice. Go on, doctor. Oh, Daddy. Is he gonna be all right? Well if he is, we'll have Tupuna to thank for it. Where is he? I don't know, he was here a minute ago. His pulse is picking up. I think he's gonna make it. Gabe. All I wanna say is, thanks. Okay. Do you think we'll all be able to save ourselves? Well the boat's almost finished, huh? If we had a little more time, and... If only we could let Tupuna's people know that we didn't come here to cause any trouble. Judy? Gabe, get up! Sharks! Dad, Dad! How do you feel? A little weak, baby, but fine otherwise. Aw, thank goodness. That medicine of Tupuna's really works. Dad. Gabe and Judy are gone. - Where? - We don't know. They were gone when we woke up this morning. Stu and Tupuna are out looking for them. What sort of shape is the boat in? Stu says that it, well it needs just a little bit more work. Well we can't afford to waste any time. As soon as they show up, you send Gabe and the boys right down to me. This current's so strong, we can hardly make any headway! But I still think we should try and find Tupuna's people! Judy, no. We'll be leaving the island soon. Besides, you couldn't make peace, they'd kill you. Where are Gabe and Judy? I don't know. We searched the whole beach. I can't figure it out. Gabe! Look! It's a war canoe! Too late! They've come to kill us. Not if we can get back in time to warn the others! The current's going to be stronger against them than it was for us! We have a few hours before they can reach the island! What are you doing? I'm gonna tie a tow. They must be on the island. I can't believe that Gabe would try to go out to sea and through that current. Well then, where are they? They just couldn't vanish. Oh, I see. Our football player has become more than just a college crush, eh? Don't you worry, honey, we'll find them. Now you take Liz back to the house. Stu, we'll have to organize a search pattern. Well Tupuna, I wish I knew how to say thank you. Gabe, what's happened? I'll tell you later, there's a war canoe. We only have a few hours. All right, Sharon, you and Liz help Judy. Start loading supplies into the boat. Stu, you do everything you can to get that boat ready. Gabe. You and I have a job to do. Our lives will depend on it. We'll be ready in time, if we can get this boat to sea. Once we're out there, we have no way of navigating. If we do get past that war canoe, we can still die. We might never sight land again. Right, we must have a compass. Gabe, I'm making a calculated guess. I believe that when the storm hit, The Quest was swept across those reefs and out to sea. It would have ripped her bottom out. Or, rolled her so that she spilled whatever was loose on deck. Well then we've always searched on the - wrong side of the reef! - Right! I think we might find what we want on the other side. There's not much air left in these tanks. Are you willing to try? Let's go. Earthquake! Hold on! What about Tupuna, Judy, will he come with us? I've tried to tell him how much I, we wanted him. I think he knows, but I'm... All right, stand by! Watch out for the out rigger! Dad. The war canoe. Pray for wind. If we can just make it around that head run, the sails should do it for us. Come on, baby, come on! We're going, we're going! Hurry, Gabe. Come on! Hey, Gabe! Come on, hurry! Come on, Gabe. We're going! We're going! But Daddy, where's Drip? Hello, Drip. We'll pick up some more coconuts at the next stop.
