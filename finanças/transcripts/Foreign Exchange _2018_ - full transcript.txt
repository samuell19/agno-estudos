There you go! Be right back. Thank you, sir. - Oh! Oh! - Damn, I'm sorry. Uh, it's okay. Honestly, it's, it's fine. I can do it. Your accent, you sound like you're from... - Scotland. - Scotland. That's what I was gonna say. - Foreign-exchange student? - Yeah. I'm Kevin. - Ana. - Nice to meet you, Ana. Nice to meet you, too. Do you wanna come have a drink with me and my friends? - Uh... - Come on. No, thanks, I'm studying. Yeah. - Studying in a bar. - Mm-hmm. I like your style, Ana. - I like yours, too, Kevin. - Thanks. Oh, yeah! That's right. Almost hit it. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, you shattered my eardrum. I'm sorry, really. There's some guy following me. Oh, yeah? Hey! Creeper! Well, look at this winner. Come closer so we could see your face! Don't worry. We outnumber him. Yeah, that's right! Run home to Mommy! - My name is Monica. - Ana. Come on. - I'll walk you home, Ana. - Okay. Oh, God! God, I'm freezing. What about you? It's balls-ass cold. - "Balls-ass?" - Like, really freaking cold. Actually, no. It gets far colder than this where I'm from. I wouldn't be able to handle it. You miss your family? It's complicated, huh? My family is complicated, too. - Where are you from? - Fallbrook. Middle of nowhere. You'd love it. What the hell is that? That is the reason why I study in bars. My roommate. - No. - Mm-hmm. She plays the tuba in the marching band. Oh! You poor thing! Yeah. Thanks for walking me home. Should we get each other's numbers? Uh, to clear the air, I wasn't checking you out at the bar. You just... reminded me of someone. I didn't think you were checking me out. You suck at lying. I like that. Very un-American. Here. Be careful. You be careful. That sounds dangerous. This is twisted. Has anything else weird happened? Not really. "Not really?" Sometimes I just feel like someone's watching me. I don't know. I could just be paranoid. What do you think I should do? You should stay with me. Seriously. This guy knows where you live. - You hate your roommate. - I don't hate Karen. And I've got a huge place all to myself. My place is covered by the exchange program. - I can't afford to-- - I'm not asking you for money, Ana. But... I can't just move in somewhere and not pay anything. Yes, you can. My parents pay the rent. - Oh, and they wouldn't mind? - They would love you. You're sweet, wholesome-- Yeah, I wouldn't call myself wholesome. You don't drink, you go to church, you volunteer at a children's hospital, and, best of all, you're saving yourself for marriage. - That's what I would tell them. - Are you being serious? You'd actually have to tell them all that? Say yes, say yes, say yes! - Okay, yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes. Okay. - Welcome home. - Thank you. - Here, let me take this. - Okay. - Just make yourself at home. - Okay. Um, do you want to grab the frying pan? - Yes. In here? - In there. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Thank you. You just look so bored there, you know, so... What? Okay. I love that you know how to play chess. It was my sister's favorite game. Did you have a roommate before me? No. Then why the twin beds? My sister and I had these since we were kids. I can never get rid of them. Is she... Dead. Car accident. I'm sorry. Her name was Camilla. You're the first person I've ever let sleep in her bed. Really? Thank you. You look like her, you know? A lot like her. - I'll take that as a compliment. - It is. You have any brothers or sisters? Just my mum and I. We lived in the country with my grandparents when I was little. You know, it was nice. Then... my mum got mad at my grandma and moved us to the city. Then things got pretty bad. Bad how? You don't have to talk about it. My mum's an addict. Drugs, alcohol, sex. - She's abused it all. - Wow. How did you end up so normal? I'm not that boring. Who said anything about boring? My friends back home, for one. It's hard to get excited about partying when you find your mum covered in vomit one too many times. Does this mean we can't party? I've loosened up... a bit. Goodnight. Night. - Ana? - Oh. Kevin. - Everything okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. You going to class? - No, I was just leaving. - Same. Do you mind if I walk with you? Sure. Have you had a chance to check out the city or any of the museums or... Not yet. I'd like to. I've just been too wrapped up in school. Ah, me, too. I can barely find my way around. - You're not from here? - No, I'm a small-town boy. Cities are a bit overwhelming to me. Maybe we could do some exploring together sometime. Maybe. Could I get your number? We'll see each other around, I'm sure. Well, I am this way. You don't want me to know where you live. You know, I almost asked Monica for your number, but I didn't want to scare you off. Oh, that's right. You know Monica. Little bit. Yeah, we're from the same hometown. She's been really nice to me. Good. You deserve it. Well, Ana, until we see each other around... adieu. Is this blood? - I think so. - Oh, this is too much. We should go to the police. - Can they do anything? - Unfortunately, probably not. But we have to do something. I just moved in here and he knows it. He must be following me all the time. You don't think it could be your friend Kevin, do you? Kevin? I ran into him today right after I got more creepy texts. No way. Kevin is way too boring. Really? He doesn't seem that boring to me. Okay, now I'm confused. Are you scared of him or do you like him? I don't know. I just feel like I can't trust anybody. This is so messed up. Let's get out of here. And go where? My hometown. Fallbrook. What about school? Spring break's coming up, so we head out early. We can study at my parents' house. I mean, there's nothing else to do there. And by the time we get back, hopefully, this stalker has gone back to watching porn and playing video games. And if not... then we call the police. And your parents wouldn't mind? Are you kidding me? They're not gonna want you to leave. Okay. Whoa! Oh. My parents are, uh, pretty conservative. I know I should just be myself around them, but... I think you look great. Not too Amish? Mm... Kind of naughty Amish. - I like it. - Oh. I do. Welcome to Fallbrook. There's a small downtown, but it's half an hour away. The families here take care of each other. You know, one family gives us fresh eggs. We give them vegetables in return. That seems really nice. Kind of a hippie vibe, I guess, without all the drugs and sex and other fun stuff. We have arrived! - Yeah! - Home. Home! - Cool. - Monica-Bear! - Daddy! - Ha-ha! Oh! - You're still my good girl? - Always. This is my friend, Ana. She's from Scotland. I'm sure you'll love her just as much as I do. Welcome to our little slice of heaven, Ana. - I'm Peter. - So nice to meet you, Peter. - Oh... - Oh! - Scotland, is it? - Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful country. Traditional, family-oriented. We could stand to learn a thing or two from your culture. Oh, my goodness. You, you really do look like her. Our daughter, Camilla. - Monica told me. - I-I... - Hello, Ana. I-I'm sorry. - Hello. I'm having a little bit of a silly moment. That's... - I'm Olivia. - Nice to meet you. Oh! Oh, my goodness. - We're huggers. - Okay. - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, sweet girl! Oh, my goodness. - How are you? - Good. Come inside. I've got pies and cookies. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, our bags! No, no, no, that's what the big lug is for. - How was the trip? - Great! - Yeah, it wasn't bad at all. - Yeah. What kind of cookies did you make? Well, I wasn't sure what kind Ana likes, so I made chocolate-chip, peanut-butter and oatmeal. - I hope that's all right. - Oh! I hope you don't expect us to eat them all. Well, of course I do. Look at the two of you. You're wasting away. Are they feeding you up there? My goodness! Ooh! So to what do we owe this, uh, this unexpected visit? I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining. But I just about danced for joy when you told me you were coming. She did. I think it was the Polka. - Oh, stop. - We just needed a little break from the city. I recommend a permanent break from the city. - It's not that bad. - Mm. Cities bring out the worst in people. It's every man for himself. No sense of community. Without community, what are we? Animals. I like animals. Sorry, Daddy. I was just joking. Peter and I were hesitant to allow Monica to go to school in the city. Um, I tried to convince her to, to stay put and take courses on the computer, the... Kind of hard to take online classes when your house doesn't have Internet. They're both computer illiterate. And proud of it. Monica is our youngest. And as you can see, Ana, we tend to indulge her. What about you? Are you from the country or the city? I was raised in the country. Ah, I knew it. But then my mother took us to the city. Hm. Which do you prefer? Um, I think the country. It reminds me of my childhood. I've missed that. Good girl. - Hello! - Hi. - In case you get chilly. - Thank you. You're welcome. My Camilla. She's still with me, you know? Hm. Like an angel. Who's this? Oh, that's Greta, her best friend. Everything in here is the same as it was the day that... I don't mind, um, sleeping in Monica's room. - Would that be better? - No, no. That's fine. This room was meant to be lived in. I'm so glad you're here. So am I. Peter thinks you're something special, you know? He thinks people in this country have forgotten how to raise children properly. Now he can point to you as Exhibit A. Mm. You're welcome here as long as you would like. - Thank you, Olivia. - Mm. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Wake up, Sleeping Beauty! Hm? It's me. Under the pillow. Monica? Camilla and I used to have these when we were kids. I can't believe they still work. - Did I wake you up? - No. I was just lying here. Thinking. Happy thoughts? Yes. Thanks for being so cool. I know my parents are a little weird. I don't think they're weird. Are you lying? Hard for me to tell when I can't see your face. No! I like them. I like it here. Thanks for bringing me, Monica. You there? Thanks for coming. Goodnight. Sleep tight. Over and out. ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh aah ♪ ♪ Ooh-aah ♪ ♪ Oo-oo-ooh ♪ What are you... You're trespassing. This is private property. I'm sorry. I was just hiking. I'm a friend of the Jansens. Please leave here. Now. Of course. Sorry. - Oh, good morning! - Morning. I thought I was a morning person. I didn't even hear you get out! You really are a country girl. - Help yourself to some coffee. - Mm, thank you. I went for a hike. The forest is amazing. Mm. Oh, you be careful. You get easily lost out there. Sometimes even Peter gets turned around. I came across a woman. I guess I was on her property. She wasn't very happy about it. Yes, that would be, that would be Zelda. You should steer clear of her. She's a, she's... She's a very sad woman. Why is she sad? Don't you worry about that. Country breakfast. Eggs, bacon sausages and some freshly-made biscuits. Mm! Yes, please! - Good. - It's amazing. - Where is Monica? - Um... Still in bed. Fresh air makes her lazy. Zelda is Greta's mother. Greta was Camilla's best friend, right? They were in the accident together. - Camilla burned to death. - Oh, my God. - They never found Greta. - Really? They think she must have gotten hurt and wandered into the woods. It was winter, so she must have frozen to death. That's so horrible. Zelda hasn't been the same since. I think she blames our family for it. You know, Greta was all she had. But my mom's probably right. Best if you stay away from her. Of course. Mm... Oh! Bad move. Bad move! What is it? Oh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry for sneaking up on you. It's not your fault. I... I thought I saw someone outside and I... I just got a little bit scared. Someone outside? - Where? - Down by the forest. I didn't see anyone. May have been poachers. It's not deer season yet, but some people hunt at night, which is stupid and dangerous. Well, uh... goodnight. Goodnight. You know... I think you're a good influence on Monica. Sometimes I worry about her. Especially in that city, all those... temptations. Monica's helped me out a lot. She's a good person. I don't think you have anything to worry about. I hope you'll stay here for a good, long time, Ana. Haven't seen Olivia this happy since... since we lost Camilla. Losing a child... it almost broke her. Almost broke us both. But in a way, it's what happens to every parent. They may rebel or go astray or they just grow up and don't need you anymore. But Camilla was a good girl. You remind us so much of her. It's almost like... she's back with us. "You can run, but you can't hide." Okay, he knows you left, but he doesn't know where you are. I mean, even if he did, do you know what my dad would do if anybody tried to mess with you? I don't wanna know. Trust me, it would not be pretty. - You're safe here. - I know. You wanna go check out the town today? We could pick up groceries for my mom. Sure. Sounds good. Here we are. - Here you go. - Thank you. You know, you really remind me of someone. - Camilla? - Camilla? That's right. Camilla Jansen. Poor girl. She died in that horrible car accident. Are you part of the family? I'm just a friend. Something wrong? They were too strict on that girl. How so? People say she was trying to run away when the accident happened. Oh. It's a rumor. Every small town has its share of those. Enjoy. Must've driven all through the night to get here. - It was a great drive, though. - Oh. Well... Wow! Uh... You, you really do look like her. I'm sorry, you must be sick of hearing that, but, uh... Uh, Camilla was like a daughter to me, so, um... Ana, this is Sheriff Eden. My dad's best friend. - They're practically brothers. - Well... Well, Peter and I go all the way back to Sunday school. I was best man at his wedding and then he returned the favor when Maribell finally gave up and decided to marry me. You're from the UK, is that right? - Scotland. - Oh. Well, welcome to Fallbrook. Thank you. It's very nice here. - It is. Isn't it? - Mm-hmm. Well, it's Tuesday, which means the girls and I will be around for dinner, so I will see you two girls later. You, um... You have a lovely afternoon. Bye, Sheriff Eden. You see that? We even got the cops on our side. No one can mess with you in Fallbrook. Oh. Oops. - Let's go shopping today? - Yeah. Hey, Monica. Here. Let me give you a hand. - Ana? - Kevin? Wow! This is a pleasant surprise. Uh, just a little help over here? Sorry. Ah. Huh. Oh. Oh. - There you go. - Thanks. It's good to see you. - What are you doing here? - Visiting my mom. What about you guys? We just needed a little getaway. Well, cool. We should hang out. Or not. We'll see. Uh, we're kind of busy. All right. I gotta get some stuff for my mom. - It's good to see you, Ana. - You, too. That was awkward. You don't think it's weird he just shows up here? This is his hometown, Ana. But spring break hasn't started yet. We left early, remember? I guess he did, too. But why? Well... I don't really know if he wants everybody to know this, but... his mom's been pretty sick the last couple of years. I don't think she has much time left, so... Oh, my God, are you serious? Unfortunately. I am such a jerk. I was so rude to him. - No, you weren't. - Yeah, I was. Should I go talk to him? I should go talk to him. Relax. I can give you his number if you want. Hey. This is why stalking is so evil. That jerk has gotten into your head. You don't know who to trust anymore. But you have to remember... you are the victim. None of this is your fault. Can I ask you something? Okay. The woman at the cafe mentioned Camilla. Well, you do look like her. She, uh, she said that Camilla was running away when she... This town is a hotbed of gossip, Ana. You shouldn't believe everything you hear. - Especially about us. - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned anything. Hey, you mind if I take off for a little bit? No, of course not. Where are you going? To see a guy I used to hang out with. But I don't want my dad to know. What's the big deal? - You've seen what he's like. - Mm. If he asks, just, uh, tell him I went to go see a friend. - Okay. - No. Uh, tell him I've been thinking about Camilla and I just needed some time to clear my head. Okay. Thanks. - Oh, hey, Monica. - Yeah? You think I can get Kevin's number? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Hello. - Hi, Kevin. It's Ana. - You know, from-- - Ana! - Hey, great to hear from you. - Hi, uh... So it was really nice seeing you today. Uh, just wanted to apologize to you. Um... I was really rude to... And-and nothing to do with you. You weren't rude. Yeah, I was, and I'm sorry. Well, if being rude results in you calling me, then by all means, continue to be rude. - Ana. - Oh, hi. Just I'm on the phone. Sorry, Kevin, can I give you a call back? Yeah, sure thing. Thanks. Bye. - Is everything okay? - Where is Monica? She just went for a drive. - With who? - No one. She, she's been thinking about Camilla, and I think she just needed to be alone for a bit. You are a good girl, aren't you? Yeah. I guess. It's so much harder for girls in this world. You always have to be careful. Especially with boys. We have close friends joining us for dinner. I'm sure Olivia would appreciate your help in the kitchen. Sure. Of course. Would you like some help, Olivia? Camilla. No. You've come back. I was so worried. Where have you been? Why would you worry your mother like that? I, um... These pills that Peter give me, they... Oh, I get so confused. - I'm sorry. Uh... - Maybe you should lay down-- No, no, no, no. I'm okay. There's dinner. - We're-we're having guests. - It's okay. - I'll take care of it. - Oh. Oh, we-- The girl is right, dear. - Come on now. - Uh, well, the... The meat is in the refrigerator. I was going to make a-a nice pot roast. All right. I like to cook, so... But you're sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Okay. You are a good girl. - She's-she's a good girl. - Okay. Hm. Hm. Hey, Kevin. Sorry about that. No problem. Do you know Monica's parents? No, the family's always kept to themselves. Well, I never really talked to Monica until we ran into each other at college. - Hm. - You still there? - Yeah. - Everything okay? - Things are just a little... bit weird. - Weird? Sometimes, it's like her mum and dad think I am Camilla. Well, um, you're practically her twin. It's gotta be weird for them, too. - That's true. - But... If things get too weird, you-you can always come stay with me. Like, in your own room, I meant. I-I wasn't asking you to-- Thanks, Kevin. Listen, can I talk to you later? I need to make some dinner. - Yeah, sure thing. - Okay. Thanks. Bye. John, Maribell, come on in. Hello. You look lovely. Is this dress new? I bet you made it yourself. - Indeed, she did. - Thank you. Hello, Lucille. I smell Olivia's famous roast. Olivia has a new assistant tonight. She wasn't feeling well and had to lie down. Oh, no. Maribell, maybe you could check on her. Hello, I'm Ana. Lucille's a shy girl. Honey, you can say hello. Mm, hello. Uh, where's Monica? She needed a little time to herself. - Have you heard from her? - No. I'm sure she'll be back soon. Come on in. Pour me some wine please, someone. Might be best to skip the wine, dear. Your medicine. Pour me some wine. Someone, please. Ana, dear, would you pour me some wine? Excuse me. Thank you, love. That's a good pour. You pour well in Scotland. - The roast is excellent. - Mm, absolutely delicious. - You can really cook, Ana. - Olivia had it all ready. I just, just finished the job. Modest, too. Lucille, take note. Ana, would you hand me the bottle, please? Olivia, you've had enough. Ana, you're a long way from home. Um, you miss your family? - A little bit. - Um, well, a little bit? Yeah, I don't see my mother very often even when I am home. Ana never knew her father. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Um... Is, uh, is he deceased? Um... I don't know. You know, I never really knew my father, either. Peter's dad took me under his wing and took up the slack, I guess you could say. I'll forever be indebted to this family. But, uh, for a man to abandon his responsibilities like that is something I can never understand. There is a lot about this world I will never understand. Mm-hmm. Well, here's to you, Ana. You seem to be doing fine by yourself. But always be careful, though. It just takes one misstep to end up on that naughty list. Not, Ana. She's a good girl. - Oh. Oh, dear. - Oh. John? Oh. All right, all right. All right, okay. Oh. - I can't. - Maribell, can you? All right, here we go. Here. Whoa! All right... Thank you. Thank you. Leave. What? Leave. Hey! Sorry, I'm late. My car broke down. - Really? - Yeah. Sucks. I got it towed to our mechanic, but I won't find out what's wrong until tomorrow. Wow, this looks amazing! I'm starving. Hey, Lucille, what's up? Sorry I left you alone for so long. Can't believe you had to do all the cooking by yourself. I don't mind. I like helping out. You are a rock star. Lucille was acting sort of... strange. Oh, yeah? How so? She told me to leave. She's, um... I, uh, don't know the, uh, the politically correct way to say it is, but, uh, Lucille's always been, uh, a little slow. Oh. Okay, now I feel bad. Don't-don't feel bad. Did you call Kevin yet? Look at you! You really like him, don't you? - I hardly know him. - So get to know him. Monica. Hello? Ana. You made it. - Thanks to your pin. - Yeah. Yeah, I-I don't know what people did before GPS. - Nice to see you. - Yeah. It's so beautiful here. Yeah. This reminds me of being a kid and, and sneaking out at night. What would you do? I-I don't know. Just walk around. I was a pretty boring kid, I guess. What about you? You ever sneak out? Didn't have to. My mum didn't care what I did. Kind of takes the fun out of doing something bad. Yeah. Growing up, I was always jealous of the kids who lived over here. How come? It just seems so perfect. All this space. My neighborhood is a little different. We're literally on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. Maybe the more perfect a place seems, the more secrets it's hiding. Interesting. Is this theory based on your experiences in Fallbrook? Maybe. I feel like you have some juicy gossip, but you're too much of a good girl to share it. Ugh! What? What did I say? Uh, "Good girl." I'm tired of hearing that. Point taken. There's something I'd like to tell you. The, um... The reason that Monica and I came here is because someone was, sort of, stalking me back at school. Stalking you? Oh, that's, that's horrible. - I'm sorry, Ana. - It's made me paranoid. I'm tryin' to get over it, but it's not easy. Who's out there? - Hello? - Shh! You are on private property. And I have a gun. Well, that added some excitement to the evening. Thanks for coming out. Why did you sneak out? I... I didn't sneak out. What were you doing out there? - Walking. - With who? Please leave me alone. I'd like to be alone right now. You're making me uncomfortable. While you're under my roof, you will abide by my rules. Is that clear? I'm sorry I startled you. I'm just... trying to look out for you. I still think you're a good girl. Ana? Mm. - Yeah. I'm here. - I'm sorry. He had no right to say whatever the hell he just said to you. God, I hope it wasn't too nuts. You must think we're all crazy. I didn't call anyone crazy. Let's talk tomorrow, okay? Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. So what do you think? How are you feeling about everything? I want to leave. I was afraid you were gonna say that. What if I talk to my dad? I'm sure I can get him to apologize. My parents have never recovered from losing Camilla. They blame themselves. And my dad means well. He's just being overprotective. Not that that excuses his behavior. I'm sorry, Monica, I'm just not comfortable here anymore. Besides, I can't hide from this stalker forever. I appreciate you bringing me here. I really do. It's time for me to go back. Okay. But I still have to get my car fixed first. Well, you shouldn't have to drive me if you're not ready to leave. Just... Well, I'll get an Uber or something. Even if you could get a driver to come all the way out here, which is highly doubtful, do you know how expensive that would be? Geez, Ana. He's not some monster. - I didn't say that. - Whatever. Okay. Hold on a sec. Okay. My dad's going to take me over to the mechanic's now. They're buddies, and my dad says he'll work faster if we pressure him. Well, okay, you don't have to do that. I don't mind waiting. Clearly you do. Monica. I'm sorry. It's okay, Ana. I'm just embarrassed... and disappointed. Monica told me what happened. The night Camilla died... she snuck out to go for a ride with Greta and, uh... Hm. Well, you know how men are. And they just wanna fix everything. And I think that with you looking so much like Camilla and going out at night time like you did, I-I think that perhaps it was just a little too much for Peter to deal with properly. Yes? And, um... I owe you an apology as well. No, you don't. Ana, I, uh, I know that I scared you yesterday, and for that I'm sorry. I am, uh, I'm trying different medications. Hm. As if a pill would bring back Camilla. A-anyway, they, um, they make me a little bit loopy. Olivia, it's okay, really, um... You guys have been so nice to me. I've just been... I've just been dealing with my own problems. That's, that's all. Of course you are, dear. Well, I do hope that you would, uh, perhaps reconsider staying here a bit longer. No pressure, of course. I think I'm gonna do some studying. Okay. You could do it out here if you would like. I'll move my stuff. And I could use the company. Okay. Olivia, do you have another pen that I could use? Uh, why don't you try Monica's room? Okay. Should I start some lunch? Sure, sounds good. All right. Monica, I'm leaving tonight with Greta and I'm not coming back. I can't take it anymore. There's something not right about Dad and it's only getting worse. He changed the lock on my door so I can't get out. It's-it's like I'm a prisoner. He's telling me how I need to be a good girl again. I'm not gonna end up like Lucille. I can't trust anyone but you and Greta. Just lay low and try to act like a good girl so Mom and Dad leave you alone for now. I'll contact you when I can. I love you so much. Love, Camilla. Lunch time! Oh, my goodness. I scared you again, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. Did you find one? What? - A pen? - Yeah. Good. Our tuna sandwiches are ready. White bread, no crusts. Just how you like it. Hm. Aren't you eating? Yummy. Don't forget your milk. It's good for strong bones. Oh, how I used to worry that you weren't getting enough milk when you were little. Go on. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'll, I will get a towel. I'm so sorry. I don't feel so good. I'm gonna lie down for a nap. Camilla ran away because her parents were gonna lock her up in her room. They didn't want her to grow up, Kevin. Okay. You don't believe me. You're joking, right? I mean, that sounds-- Crazy. I know. They're trying to trap me in here, Kevin. - Why? - To replace Camilla. Monica's mum thinks I am Camilla right now. And there was no stalker. It was Monica. She did it to get me out here. They did it. They planned altogether. If that's true, you should call the police, Ana. I can't. Sheriff Eden's in on it, too. - Sheriff Eden? - Yeah. Look, whether or not you believe it, I just need, I need your help. Can you meet me in the meadow? - Yeah, okay. I'll leave now. - Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Bad girl. What did I say about sneaking out? What are you doing? Where are they going? - Let go of me. - Wait. I can help you. - Kevin. Oh! - Hey. Thank you for coming. I know how crazy I must sound. Ah, you don't feel safe. That's all that matters. - Monica's dad tried to stop me. - What? Are you serious? We need to hurry. Come on, let's get out of here. I passed Sheriff Eden on my way here. He's looking for me. It's hard for me to believe he'd be involved in this, but he did bust me for drinking beer when I was 15, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Hey, don't worry. We're gonna get out of here. - I can't let the sheriff see me. - You should get in the back. You can keep down until we get to town. - Uh-oh. - What? Sheriff Eden is heading toward us. Just stay down. Okay. We passed him. He did seem like he was looking for someone. Starting to believe me? I never said I didn't believe you. True. Sorry. This is all sort of new for me. Me, too. Kind of exciting. I said no peeking. - I thought you were a good girl. - You, too? Who do you think was following you the night you met Monica? - You planned this together. - Camilla was my girlfriend. We were meant to be together. But she stopped being a good girl. Monica never was a good girl. She's a lost cause. But it doesn't matter because I just want you. No, no, no, don't get the wrong idea. Peter and Olivia will take care of you. I just want the chance to get to know you. You know, without all the distractions of the city, it'll be completely innocent. The way things are supposed to be. No. No. - Well done, Kevin. - Thanks, Dad. - Stay away from me. - Calm down. - Please, Camilla. - Ah, don't call me that! Why are you doing this? You're supposed to help people. I'm trying to help you. Wait, wait. Listen, listen. Peter's father taught us that the most important job a man has is to protect his family and women, most of all. There is no safer place than right here. He's right, Camilla. It's a sick world out there. One day you will understand. No. No... - It's okay, I'm a doctor. - No, no, no... Please, please... Kevin... Don't worry. You're gonna be my sweetheart again, Camilla. Don't frighten the poor girl. Kevin will visit. But it will be up to you whether or not you want to spend time with him. Under my supervision, of course. It's all right, I've raised Kevin to be very respectful of women. It's okay, sweetheart. We're doing this all for you because we all love you so much, Camilla. - Oh, good, you're up. - How are you feeling? You must be hungry. I made your favorite. - I hate tuna fish. - Don't say that, Camilla. I'm not Camilla. Listen to my voice. Do I sound like Camilla to you? You will not talk to your mother like that. - She's not! - Silence! Do not speak. Listen! Understand? For now you will be confined to your room. You will have everything you need. You will think about escaping, of course, but I warn you not to try. It won't work. And the punishment will be very severe. Once you've re-earned our trust, you'll be able to use the rest of the house again. And if that goes well, maybe even outside. Let me go. - You can't do this. - We are doing this. It's for your own good, Camilla. - Stay away from me. - Do not make me restrain you. Take this, honey. It will calm you down. It's the pill or the needle again. Your choice. Open up. Open your mouth. Olivia. Rise and shine, sweetheart! Oh, sleepyhead. Brought you some breakfast. All right. Camilla, you didn't finish your tuna sandwich, young lady. Don't make me bring your father in here. Come. Listen... Camilla! Camilla, don't... Open the door, Camilla. All this will do is make your father very angry. You can't get away from here, sweetheart. We'll find you. Peter! Peter, help! She got out! Peter, help! Help! Help! Help! She got out, Peter! Yes, I need help. Yes, this is an emergency. Okay, Camilla, that's enough. ...right away. They locked me up. - Calm down. Calm down. - No! - No! - Silly girl. Even if you'd gotten away, I'd just send Sheriff Eden after you. You're never getting away. You need to accept that, Camilla. She's not Camilla. - Zelda? - She's not Camilla. You need to accept that, Peter. Hands up. - Listen to me. - Hands up! Get in the truck. Get out of here. I won't let him send anyone after you. I didn't know what they were planning, any of them. And I don't know you, but I know you don't deserve this. No one does. You come any closer, you will make a murderer out of me, Peter Jansen. I swear on the soul of my dear Greta. Go on! Thank you. I thought you were my friend. Family comes first. You were just gonna let them lock me up. How can you do that... to anyone? I have my reasons. Have you called the cops? I bet your story will be a little hard for them to swallow. I want my life back. You're too late, Ana. I'm right on time. Camilla? It was Greta who died in the crash. Wasn't it? Zelda found me. She made it look like I was the one who died. She lost Greta, but she saved me. Monica got an idea. She made a deal with your dad, didn't she? If he let her go to the city, she would find a replacement for you. I was always their favorite. They didn't even try to hide it. So if Monica could find someone who looked like me, they could have their perfect good girl back. We never thought she would find someone who looks so much like me. And when she found you, it seemed like it was meant to be. At least that's what we told ourselves. Everybody wins, right? - Everybody except me. - I know it's no excuse. But we had a pretty messed-up childhood. You're right. It's not an excuse. And you're not the only ones who had a rough childhood. None of us wanted to end up like our mothers, huh? Well, she was just trying to help me. She's always tried to help me. You didn't deserve any of this. So what was the final part of the plan? Monica would... escape to the city and you would, what? Steal my identity and ride off into the sunset? To Scotland. My passport. I have a ticket on a plane that leaves in three hours. I was gonna just... start over. Maybe it is possible. What if you took that flight? I'll report my passport missing, eventually. But I'll leave you enough time to get over there and get settled. Why? Why would you do that? Let's just say I know what it's like to need to start over. Scotland's a lovely country. I think you'll like it. I'm gonna stick around here for a little while. - Really? - Yeah. I don't scare so easily. Besides, I need to file a report with social services about Lucille. I'm not going anywhere until she's free. So what do you say? It'll be a true foreign exchange. I... I don't know what to say. Then don't say anything. You have a plane to catch. She'll be fine. Bye, Monica. I love you. Here. Take it. Camilla's gone. She says that she loves you. You need to start packing. Well, I'm taking your apartment. Your family will keep paying the bills, though. It's the least you guys can do, right? You must be hungry. How would you like your eggs? Scrambled. Perfect. Me, too.
