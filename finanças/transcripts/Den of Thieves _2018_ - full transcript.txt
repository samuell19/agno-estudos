What the fuck was that? Did you see him go for his gun? DONNIE: I don't know. I just saw Bosco lit him up. Take the second left into the tunnel. Hug the airport. Take the tunnel. Go right on Doty. Right on Doty. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Make sure you take care of those weapons. I don't want any accidental discharges. - What are you looking at him for? - Ray. I'm not talking to him. I'm talking to you. What the fuck was that? What else did you fuck up, huh? (GRUNTS) You sure you were clean all the way home? Catch any tails? Where did Marcus take those rounds? Femoral artery. He's done. Well, we knew the risks. Shit popped off. We handled it. That's it. Hey, B. Get back over there. See who responded. It was probably LASD. They'll supersede Gardena, but if it's Major Crimes, we've got a problem. All clear? No GPS? It's one of the old models, man. We good. We've got to get this patched up. We need this clean. (MERRIMEN SIGHS) You good? We're cop killers now. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Come on. Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me, babe. Can't do that. What are you doing right now? You erasing your recent calls? My phone? What do you mean? I don't know how to work this fucking thing. You know that. "I don't know how to work this fucking thing. You know that." Come on. (SIGHS) Babe, we really have to go through this right now? Where you been? It's 6:00 a.m. Where have you been? Been at work? Surveillance? Robbing drug dealers? Because you smell like a stripper. Of course, I was at work. It's funny 'cause I got this text. What was so hot, then? Is that a work text? Huh? You fucked up. You text me instead. (CHUCKLES) Who does that? It's street theater, babe. It's not what it looks like. I'm sorry. Me, too. Fuck. DEBBIE: We're going to go to Auntie's house because Daddy's got to do a little work on the house. And we have something else to do. - Come on. - What the fuck? Hey, yo. It's gonna be too loud for you guys, okay? - Hey. Deb? Deb? - Will you put this on? - Can you help me with that? - What are you doing, Deb? What the fuck are you doing? - It will be too loud for you guys. - Wifey, wifey. Seriously, what are you doing? McKENNA: Is Daddy coming with us? No, Daddy does not have enough time for us right now. - Seriously... That's nice. That's nice. - Can you put this on here? Hey, honey. Mommy didn't mean that, okay? Hey, sweetie, come here. Mommy didn't mean that, okay? She didn't mean that, okay? Sweetie, you okay? Yeah, great. Great. Hey. Come here, honey.

Okay, put your bags in there. You wanna put your sister in the seat? Where's the pink bag? Have you lost your fucking mind? Oh, great language right in front of my daughter. Great fathering! Nice. Nice. Dropping F-bombs in front of my daughters. - "My kids"? "My kids"? - Great fathering! Gonna find a guy whose cock actually gets hard for me. Deb, Deb, Deb. Stop! Please don't do this. Please. This is a little hard. You're just scared right now, okay? You're confused. Okay... Out of the way, Nick. Get out of the way, Nick. Get the fuck out of here, you fucker! You motherfucker!

You've got to be fucking kidding me. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Well, that looks like it hurt. No? Good morning, fellow officers. - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah? I take it he's a bad guy. You mean the guy with the black body armor, shotgun, and gas mask? That's very funny. We know who he is yet? Rough night? Yes. Next subject? You're not looking so hot there, bubba. I think he looks amazing. I've got enough toxins in me to turn the Gaza Strip into a Gay Pride parade. You better start downing the POM juice, big man. We've got a piss test Friday. Thursday. What, like you Mormons have been drinking wheatgrass all fucking month? Please. You got another one of those? I'm fucking starving. BORRACHO: Yeah, there's a couple that don't have blood. I think it's one of the pinkies with the sprinkles. GUS: That's some real donut. Those are horrendous, dude. Hey. You guys push back the perimeter. Need to extend the crime scene, okay? Too goddamn small. - OFFICER: You got it. - NICK: What's the tally? We've got four dead, six on the way to the hospital. - But they'll be all right. - Fuck. Ambushed them as they were coming to get breakfast. Surrounded the truck. This poor fool right here was trying to do what he gets paid to do. AP rounds blasted through the windshield took him out. They took the truck, Gardena police lost them under Hawthorne Municipal. They knew the route. Picked it because it was next to Municipal Airport, knew the restricted air space meant no ghetto bird air support. We're dealing with a different animal here, boys. Talk to the armored car company? What was the haul? They were en route to a bank pickup for a Fed drop. But there was nothing in the truck. Nothing in the truck? They stole a fucking empty armored truck? Yup. (SIRENS WAILING) Why the fireworks? One of the vics said the messenger went for his gun. That's when it popped off. Genius. Okay, the SUV, what have we got? That's a cold car. VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen. No prints on it. They bleach-bombed it. Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker. Swab it. Detail it. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) (CAR DOOR SHUTS) (NICK GROANS) Fuck. I can't deal with this retard factory this early. One of you guys handle it? It's all you, bro. Thank you. All right, witnesses, donut shop guy? He saw them, and they looked right at him, but, for some reason, they left him alone. Okay, pull all video surveillance and plate readers. Do a Palantir run. Talk to DOT, okay? Pull it all together, and meet me at the office. And find me that fucking truck. Big Nick, original gangsta cop in the flesh. Lobbin' Bob. Huh? How's that mean tennis game? (EXCLAIMS) (CHUCKLES) Look at you, man. Where'd you pick that up? Nice suit. Well, not where you're shopping. I can't afford it. I mean, how does a county sheriff pay for such a beautiful piece of men's fashion? You kidding me? This piece of shit? Nah, this is garbage. Look at you. This thing's tits! You must pull all kinds of ass sporting that, no? Nick, you know what? I can't. I can't. It's too early in the morning for your fucking circus. You just threw a donut in the hot zone. - No. I did not. - Yeah, you did. I did? That was fucking wrong. It was. I don't like you, Nick, or how you handle police business... (EXCLAIMS) What's up with that? I like you. Aside from the fact that you're a vegetarian. Vegan! I'm a vegan. - Vegetarians, they eat milk... - Yeah, sorry to hear that. What are you doing here anyway, huh? No legal tender was stolen. It isn't Federal. Yet. You're pausing for dramatic effect? (LAUGHS) You're such a big, bad lieutenant. - I know. I know. - Yeah. Can I go now, Dad? I'm kind of hungry. BOSCO: So Gardena showed up, and they secured the scene, and then these clowns took over. Who are they, LASD? Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be. Look at this clown right here. He seemed to be in charge. You recognize him? He played football at South. Remember Endo? Filipino dude the cops killed? Yeah. MERRIMEN: That's the cop who blasted him. Runs Major Crimes. Get to know your enemy, boys. Who's running this crew? TONY Z: Probably two, three guys that can pull this off, max. Why steal an armored truck with nothing in it? Bad tip, they probably botched it. Why didn't they dump it, then? - I'll take the salvage yards. - NICK: All of them. And how'd they know about a transfer from the casino to the Fed, especially one that wasn't scheduled through the regular carrier? How? It was an inside job, bro. It had to be. Oh, fuck. Give me the Pepto. Okay, inside job, but where? Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where? What about Merrimen? When did he parole again? - Eight months ago. - Eight months ago? We need to find that fucking truck. Have we still got a tail on that Wilson kid? - Yeah. - NICK: The one who was hanging out with Merrimen? What bar did he work in? - Hofbrau. - Ziggy's Hofbrau. Let's pay him a visit. (MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) (LAUGHTER) ...some Wi-Fi? No? We better check his videos. - Thanks. - All right. Wolfgang, talk to me. - Donnie, I'm tapped out. - No problem. Put it on my tab, all right? - Of course, man, I got you. - Thank you. Have a good night. (DONNIE SIGHS) Are we doing this? Yeah, man. All right, man. To money and women. That we don't have. How do you remember everybody's order like that? I can't remember the last four of my social. Lots of reps, man. I'm in complete control of my environment. People don't even know. (ZIGGY WHISTLES) - DONNIE: Hey, man, time to go. - Okay. Wrap it up. - Just a little bit. - DONNIE: Yeah, yeah. - Ziggy's going to kill me. - Shit, not going to finish. A gift. How about a tip? BAS: We got you last time. Oh, yeah, you got me last... That's not how it works. Okay, really? Zoo animals. Need change? That's for you, Fraulein. Thanks. Are there always so many cops in here? Last place I'd think they'd be. Yeah, this their spot. You know, cheap liquor. Right. Yeah, there also is a lot of shady cats in here, huh? Yeah, it's kind of neutral grounds, you know? Rick's in Casablanca type shit. You must've heard some stories in this place. You know, give them a couple of drinks, steak on his plate, some nice women around him, he'll tell you his darkest secrets. - (CHUCKLING) - Loose lips sink ships. Ain't that the truth. Mmm, what about you? Pull a lot of pussy in here? Yeah? Come on. - I do well for myself. - Yeah. I'd fuck you. Kidding. (CHUCKLES) All right. I'm out. See you later, man. Yeah. Look forward to it. (NICK WHISTLING) (CLOSES CASH DRAWER) (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) (ENGINE STARTS) - Fraulein. - Dude, what the fuck are you... (GROANS) (GROANS SOFTLY) (GRUNTING) Fraulein, you're up. Yeah. (SOFTLY) What the fuck? (MUFFLED MUSIC AND INDISTINCT CHATTER) What's up, gangster? MURPH: Oh, Peaches. Sit down. You sit right there. What you walking so slow for, nigga? I want you to sit right there. That's you right there. - Look here. There's cigarettes. - Yeah. TONY Z: (WHISTLES) Borracho! I think y'all got me confused with somebody. Hey, Sporto. You want a blow job? Why my pants wet? (LAUGHTER) Come on, man, if you and your Uncle Tom over here are into some homo shit, I'm good. Y'all just kill me now. You pissed yourself, bubba. It happens. I had one of the girls here clean you up, so you're good. But y'all got the wrong dude. You got me confused with someone. But I'm going to let you know now, I ain't the one. What'd you say? Dude something? No, we're not mistaking you for anybody. Don't be a fucking smartass. Arrested at 17 for GTA. Tried and convicted as an adult. We know exactly who you are. Did a stint at county for attempted manslaughter. Fastest speeding ticket in California history. BORRACHO: That's nice. Fucking genius, man. How fast were you going? 178. (ALL LAUGHING) Speed demon! What did you say to the cop who pulled you over? What reason did you give him? Told him they'd just paved the road. - I like him. - Ballsy. Me gusta. You may have a little pecker for a black dude. You may be a bed-wetter, but you've got some fucking style, buddy. All right, girls, time to go. Grab your shoes. Grab your shit. Let's go. Time to go home to your babies. - All right, thanks for stopping by. - Excuse me. You check this out, hot rod. You're a two-striker. You need to fucking look at me when I'm talking to you. You're one mistake away from getting sex in the ass every time you shower. Some of them niggas got gas pumps. (SNICKERS) Now, personally, that shit don't sound like a lot of fun to me. What you think? How you feel about that? Look, the dude in that picture is not even a regular at my bar. Like, I've seen him a few times, but, you know, I don't associate myself... (YAWNS LOUDLY) Do you know what this means? It means I am a member of a clique. It's kind of like being in a gang. Sort of like a gang, only we have badges, which means you are done. He ain't lying. Let me ask you this. Okay, do we look like the types who will arrest you? Put you in handcuffs, drag you down to the station? Hmm? I'm asking you a fucking question. No. Not at all. Right, exactly. We just shoot you. It's less paperwork. So tell me, what the fuck are you doing hanging out in that crew? Hmm? You're a pussy. Those dudes are bad dudes. Great thieves but straight convicts. What's Merrimen doing drinking beers with the likes of you for? Talk shop? You gonna hit the fucking Hofbrau? Take the place down, score, like, what, two grand in ones and fives? Is that what's afoot? I'll answer that for you. No, it fucking isn't. I don't know what crew you're speaking about, man. This dude just comes to my bar where I work... Stop. Shut up. Come on, man. This is some weird shit. Just... You listen to me, fuckface. We don't give a shit about you. (GASPING) You in Merrimen's crew? Hmm? Huh? You hit the stadium? (GASPS) You talky-talky now? (STRAINING) Yes, please. (COUGHING) DONNIE: Fuck! (CONTINUES COUGHING) I'm just the driver! I'm just the driver! They don't give me no gun. I don't do no gangster shit. They asked me to drive, so that's what I do. That's it. Fuck! Why did Merrimen hijack an empty armored car? I don't know, all right? They keep me in the dark for shit like this. If the cops come down on me, I can't tell them shit if I don't know shit. Now y'all can hook me up to a lie detector, a fucking polygraph, whatever y'all got. I'm telling you what I know, and that's all you'll get. Please, just let me the fuck go. Fuck y'all, man. Let me go. Well, I thought that was relatively convincing. Good stuff. All right, when did you meet him? What do I get out of this? What do you get out of this? Well, your freedom for one. Two, you're not the bad guys. We are. Couple months ago, they came through the bar, and I served them a few drinks. We started talking. Hey, Donnie, come here, man. This is my boy, Bosco. My brother for life. We deployed together. Hey, the kid can drive. Okay. Donnie, tell him about the Trans Am Series. Drove Trans Am Series, like he said, for about a season. What were their names? Hawaiian dude, he had a homie, Bosco, white boy. He was in the military, and he worked for DWP. I told him I needed some extra money, so he gave me a job. Who's that? Merrimen? Merrimen. Ray Merrimen. (LATIN HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (PANTING) So what's up with this dude? It's Marcus' boy. Worked with him over at the Hofbrau. Say he did some time with him at Wayside. He was a Marine for a minute. Say the nigga can drive. He be cool. All right, let's check him out. DONNIE: Real smart dude. He had just got out of prison from what I could tell. You ready to roll, Ray? 514! (DOOR BUZZING) Come on, let's cuff them up. You want any of your shit? No. Let's go. (DOOR BUZZING) See you soon, Ray. No, you won't. (CHUCKLES) You look great, baby. All right. Come on. (CHUCKLES) For real. Bring any sunglasses for me? Baby, I'm sorry. I forgot. Here, take mine. Take mine. (SCOFFS) Come on. They're good. They are. They look great on you. Look at that. Where'd you meet him? DONNIE: It was in Carson, at the Hawaiian dude's house. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Through your body. - What up? What up? What up? - Fucking nice. Yeah. Fool's in back. You're mine! (REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING) - Donnie, what's good, man? - What's up? - Come on, man. Follow me. - Yeah, yeah. Hey. Oh, shit. What's up? - Donnie, beer? - Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So you spent some time at Wayside? Yeah, a little bit. What do they serve for breakfast on Fridays? Silver dollar pancakes. Three of them. Where you from? Hawthorne. So you can drive, huh? Oh, I can drive. (ENGINE STARTS AND REVS) Drive. You might want to put that seat belt on. (SEAT BELT CLICKS) (TIRES SCREECHING) Whoa, whoa, whoa. (ALARM BEEPING) He liked how I drove, so, a week later, I did my first gig. We hit this rave at a stadium. (SPEAKING POLYNESIAN) Got one. Minus the dye pack, is the count all good? The count is on. That's a lot of money right there, bro. Why don't we just call it a day? Really? You want three in hot bills, you looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life, or would you rather have 30 clean? I'm just saying. Let's just call it quits while we're ahead. Put it away. We're trading up. All right. Fuck it. Let's do it. What happened to the cash? I don't know. They don't tell me. They don't talk much. Yeah, people with things to hide never have much to say. So am I under arrest, or can I leave? Nah, you just keep doing your thing. We'll be in touch. (COUGHING) (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Yeah? MERRIMEN: Horsepower, be at 1st and Central at 0800. Don't be late. DEBBIE: You always pick the same one. Just go for it. I'm here. Do whatever you want. Woo-hoo! Ran the prints on CAL-ID. Got a hit on our dead guy from Angel City. - Check your e-mail. - All right. Name's Marcus Rhodes, from Oakland. ATF was looking for him for gun charges. And more to the point that you were making before, he was stationed at 29 Palms the same time Merrimen was there. NICK: This is good. Give me the book on Merrimen. Look to your right. You know what that is? It's the bank for banks. Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve. It's the only bank that's never been robbed. All the surrounding streets are wired for sound and image. Stand across the street and stare at the building for two minutes, you'll have security on your ass asking you politely to leave. If they see your face again, every Secret Service agent in the country is going to be looking for you. The place is case-proof. There have been 53 break-in attempts. Not one has got past the lobby. That's why we're going to rob it. Okay, here we go. Laguna Niguel was in '06. Got caught for that, get sent up to USP Victorville SHU until June of '16. Now give me the unsolved book. MERRIMEN: As soon s you enter the lobby, computers run you through every law enforcement database in the country. If you've got outstanding parking tickets, they're going to know about it before you get through the first level of security. All the employees wear security swipe cards that grant them access through the first set of man-traps. Access is severely restricted. Two stories below street level is the vault floor. By the way, uh, his crimey... - Levoux? - Levoux. He serve with Merrimen? Not only that, but they played football in high school at Long Beach Poly. - You've got to be shitting me. - No. MERRIMEN: Central Security, it's the nerve center for the Fed. This is where the armored cars come in, drop off the money tubs. Money tubs are handed off to the Fed employees. At any one time, there's anywhere between 500 and 800 billion dollars in there, every millimeter of it covered by cameras, sensors, and motion detectors. Yeah. What did they specialize in? I got this from the HR desk at 29 Palms. Close Quarter Battle Unit. Both saw combat in the Middle East. Levoux specializes in explosives, where Merrimen specializes in soldiering, both MARSOC fast Marines. But there's a hitch. The serial number of every bill is recorded in the Fed's database. So, if a note goes missing, they're going to know exactly which one it is. They're going to flag it. If that bill comes up again, whoever recirculates that cash, no matter where they are in the world, that person can be tracked. Okay. Bosco, the Peckerwood? He's a Huntington Beach kid, also MARSOC Marines. He did comms with them. He had a solid career. But he didn't serve together with the other guys. He was the Wood Rep at Victorville when Merrimen was there. That's where they linked up. GUS: Donnie was a Marine for a year and a half, then discharge. So, the way I see it, that's the way all these niggas ended up working together. There's only two passports on the streets, sports and military. Every time the Fed receives a deposit from a bank, first thing they do is send that money up to the count rooms. They run the notes through the counting machines. They're accomplishing two things here. First, they're double-checking the accuracy of the bank's deposit. If the bank is off at all, they're going to credit or debit the account accordingly. Two, they're separating newer, fit currency from old unfit bills. But most importantly, they're erasing the serial numbers of the old bills from the Fed system. Once those numbers are erased, to the Fed, to the rest of the world, that money has ceased to exist. Wait, let's look at the unsolved cases. In '04, you have the Boller National Bank Hollywood job, okay? They tunneled through the sewer system. Sophisticated, skill set, someone with access, unsolved. Okay, in '05, you have the Fuerte armored car depot job. Blew the depot vault with shaped charges. In the $100 count room alone, an average of $30 million is designated as unfit every day. Between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., all the cash gets shot out to the shredder. It's all destroyed. $30 million turned to dust in seconds. It's then picked up by the Fed's waste management company and brought out to the dump. If we can get to those unfit bills before they go to the shredders and get out clean... You got $30 million nobody is looking for. MERRIMEN: Bingo. In '06, you have Laguna Niguel. Same thing, only this time, Merrimen gets unlucky with the tail-light. Goes to prison till 2016. Now, in that time, while he was in prison, how many highly sophisticated, well-executed heists do we have? None, but you're on a roll. Keep going. The counter guy at the donut shop? Witness to the whole thing. They left him. Why? Because they shoot uniforms, not unarmed civilians. Exactly what they were trained to do. Gangbangers, these are not. Okay, these are our guys. We nail these guys, we solve all these cases. This is the crew. You still haven't told us how you can get past that security. We're not going in this way. We're going in that way. What's going on with Fraulein? We can move on him anytime we want. - I pay minimum wage. - Okay. Plus $3 for delivery. And you split the tip with me. You start Wednesday, 11:00. Thank you. GUS: I don't really like the food there, but I'm down to go, - but you've got to pay this time. - NICK: I'm not paying it. TONY Z: What? - I pay every fucking time. - MURPH: What? Get off your wallet, buddy. No, I forgot my wallet today, boys. I'm sorry. - Again? - Yeah, again. Got an alligator arm. I sat down at blackjack with $5, and I made $160. MAN: Nicholas O'Brien? Yeah? I suggest you take these. You're being served. You kidding me? I'm afraid not. BORRACHO: What's going on? MURPH: You all right, bro? Yeah, I guess I'm getting divorced. TONY Z: He say "divorced"? Yo. Welcome to the fucking club. Now, go handle your business, big man. Gas the jet. Fuck. There's a closer view. There was a rolling blackout in this quadrant four days ago. Yeah, they've been happening a lot over the last few months. Okay. They say they have full backup power, but actually they don't. - They go into brown-out. - Yeah, prioritize the grid. Priority, of course, is the vault. So everything in there stays intact. But anything that is peripheral, like cameras in the hallway, shredders in the count rooms, everything else cuts out. To time it during another rolling blackout is going to be fucking impossible. - So you want to simulate it? - MERRIMEN: Can we? Break in, have them go brown for about two minutes. I'd say yes, but I'd like to have data to be sure. Great. Once we breach the count room, only thing left is the cameras. They run on their own power supply, so they're unaffected by the brown-out. The solve here is we run an EMP burst. Should take out the cameras and motion for about 30 feet. Where you get all this information from? You don't have to worry about that. Just trust me when I say it's solid. How we doing with the Telecal hook? Couple days. Shouldn't be a problem. WOMAN: (ON RADIO) How many handlers do you need? MAN: (ON RADIO) Uh, gate B right now. Strolling right into the Federal Reserve. MAN 2: (ON RADIO) Force leaving loading dock B. (BEEPING) (CLEARS THROAT) ID? Sign in, please. Keep this on you at all times. Second bay of elevators. Cafeteria's level 2. Buzz him in. He's good. Smells good. He's good. Let him in. (DOOR BUZZING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) - Sharon? - Mmm-hmm. That's me. - How you all doing? - Good. How you are doing today? - He's fine. - (CHUCKLES) Thank you. She ain't getting none. Shut up. Really? Y'all have a good day. I'm gonna stay out of it. - We will now. - You have a wonderful day. Lunch. Desert. Lunch. Desert. Bye, sunshine. There he goes. GUS: Fed's got 82. Maybe it's part of his regular route. Delivering Chinese to the Fed, my left nut. No. They're casing the joint from the inside. Okay, go back. Other than cash, what else do they take from the casino in the stadium? Fed deposit slips. - But those were probably in with the cash. - Or not. Listen, what if they were taking the cash to disguise the fact that they were really there for something else? And then they take down an armored car that's empty. Come on, guys. Look, remember what Donnie said. It's trading up. They're going big. Hey, Nick, you can't take down the Fed, man. I'm sorry, Merrimen's no dummy. It's impossible. The Fed is the Olympics, and Merrimen is Carl fucking Lewis. I'm telling you, Fraulein's holding out on us. (GASPS) My gosh. - (CHUCKLES) - Aw! - Oh, he's here. - Okay. (DOORBELL CHIMING) Damn, girl looking fine. Thank you. You look amazing. How are you? - ROLANDO: Looking good. - MALOA: Thank you. - This is my mom. This is Rolando. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Rolando. - Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you. - I see where you get your looks from. - Thank you. (LAUGHTER) Thank you. - Can I take that? - Oh, yeah, sure. Um, Rolando, this is my dad. What's up, Mr. Levoux? Nice to meet you. Let me holler at him for a second. Let me talk to you, bruh. Honey, don't worry about it. Okay? They're just gonna talk. So here's what's up. For the past 16 years, my daughter's safety and protection has been my responsibility and my responsibility only. Now, for the first time in her life, I see I've got to hand you that responsibility.

I know you already triggered the silent alarms. So I need you to pick up the phone, dial 911 dispatch, and explain the following. Go ahead and write this down. There's a 211 in progress, and we have hostages. Within one hour, they need to deliver $10 million in unmarked small denomination bills to this bank inside a department helicopter loaded with fuel. Tell them we plan on killing one hostage every hour until our demands are met. No cops are to approach the bank. And if a negotiator even tries to contact us, we will automatically kill another hostage. Is that clear? You got it all? Go ahead and pick up the phone. DISPATCHER: Any available units, we have a bank 211 in progress... Shit. ...at the Pico Rivera Savings in Montebello at 2891 Wilcox and Atlantic. - Suspects are armed... - What the fuck? ...and have taken hostages and are refusing a negotiator. What the fuck is going on? That's not their MO. Call in, tell them we're on scene, have suspects under surveillance, and to back the fuck off. This is LASD, we have surveillance on the bank. Stand down. I repeat, have all units stand down. It's bullshit. I can hear them already. (SIRENS WAILING) BORRACHO: What the fuck are they doing? Stop! Get out!

This is the branch manager. I'm speaking on the man in charge's behalf. Do you have a name, branch manager? (TREMBLING) Listen. They've already killed one of the hostages. A woman. They will not speak to you again. If you call back again before their demands are met, they'll kill another. Just send what they want. The money and the chopper are en route, but it's going to take a little bit of time. You need to give me at least 90 minutes. Is this doable? Okay. Don't call back.
