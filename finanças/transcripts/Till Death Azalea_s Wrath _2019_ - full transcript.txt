Let me go. Let me go. HELP! LET ME GO! I'm okay. I'm okay, I'm okay. Help my baby. Help my baby, please? We are nearly there. Hang in there. Hang in there. We'll go in now. Azman. Mr. Azman, your wife is stable. But I'm sorry that we couldn't save the baby. Your wife may never be pregnant again. But please don't give up, Mr. Azman. - Mm-hm. - There are other alternatives. - All right. - You can go in and see her now. Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Be patient. Please be patient, honey. HOUSE FOR SALE It's a good place. Not many people live here. Yes, it's quiet. I love the design of the house with the pool area and all. I think we can turn this area into a family area or main hall. Wow. This is good enough. The space is wide, and it has a backyard. - Yes. - Oh. - We can do a lot of things. - Exactly. Yeah. And you know what? There's even extra space to put tables for your guests. And I can give you a discount voucher for a barbeque set. - Sounds cool. - Yeah! Right, this is a good area. I love the area. Uh, Su. Honey. So, how? The house? Yeah, I think she needs more time to think. - Yeah, sure. - But I love the place. We'll go with the flow, all right? - Yes, sure. - Let's go. We've seen three houses. I don't think I can look at another one. You have to help me, okay? Hm? I'm fine with anywhere. Just choose any. I can't do that. This has to come from you. This is all for you, okay? Okay, for us. You heard me. The doctor suggested a change of environment. We have to start fresh, especially you. You think so? I don't see how any different it would be. We still can't turn back time. It's still the same. I just need more time. So choose whatever you see fit and let's just move out. I'm also tired to look at another one. Just pick. - Hello? - Hello. - Greetings, Mr. Azman. - Greetings. I'm Izwan from the orphanage. - Ah, how are you? - I'm good. Do you have any news? I'm wondering if you and your wife... - Mm-hm. - ...could come to the office today? Yes, I can do that. Okay then, we'll meet at the office. Sure. Thanks. Hey. What's wrong, honey? Huh? SRI CEMPAKA ORPHANAGE Su? Let's go. Uh... Go ahead. I'll wait here. Come on. Let's do this together. What if the news isn't so good? Honey. If it's not meant to be, there's nothing we can change. Hm? I'm sure something awaits us. Let's go. I don't think I can do this. It's okay. You go ahead. I'll wait in the car. HARD WORK IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS Kid? Kid? Huh! Give us our ball. Huh? - Have they had their lunch? - Lunch? - Yes, they have. - Okay. Are you having a good time, kids? Yes, we are. My name is Suraya binti Manaf. Next to me is Azman. Amar Affendi. Amar, you can call me "Suraya." "Auntie." If you want to, you can also call me "Mom." Or "Mama." And it's the same for Uncle Azman. You can call him "Papa" if you want. But I think he prefers "Daddy." Honey, please turn back. - Honey, turn back. - Now? BANK AUCTION This must have been his house. Okay. Okay. Are you serious? Why not? Hi, Dan. Check this out, Dan. This can be done quickly. Within two hours. He has a safe in the master bedroom. In the cupboard. It's a PIN-based safe. I've got the PIN. Where did you get it? Where else? Kong gave it to me. But his share is 40 percent. There's at least RM250,000 in the safe. We're going to be rich. 40 percent? What a freeloader. This is all from him. We just need to do the job. At least he's not asking for 50 percent. Or you'd rather it be 70 percent? What would we get if he wants 70 percent? Imagine if it's 80... Even worse if he asks 80 percent. You get it, right? Have you checked if the house is vacant? I have. Guaranteed, 100 percent. You said the same thing last time. "Guaranteed." Look what happened. Last time, Kong wasn't the intel. It was Kudin, a useless pimp. Besides, it wasn't meant to be. What could I do? We'll see. I'm being watched. Come on, Dan. Just this once. You can call it quits after that. Kong gave me a deadline. Don't you want to be rich like you once were? I'll keep an eye on the house. I'll be in touch. Dan! Wait. Hold on. - Can I ask you something? - What? I'm just checking on you. Is everything okay at home? What did you say? No, I mean, since our last job, have you been hearing voices or something like that? I think you're just stoned, man. Take it easy. Reverse. More. Stop! Oh, okay. Put the rest here. - Here, sir? - Just put them down here. Then we'll decide where they will go or the types of stuff we should bring to the kitchen. Huh? What time are they coming? Uh, I think around 7, 7:30. I told them to be here after sundown. I told you I won't be able to cook. We haven't finished unpacking. It's all right. They know we just moved in and that we're settling in. Besides, I ordered some takeouts. This place has been empty for long, so it'll be good to have people over. Okay, fine. I've heard enough. All right. - Did you see Amar? - No. Amar. Let me show you your room. Amar. Mama. He called me "Mama." I'm going to continue unpacking. Call me if you need me. Amar, here's your ball. Dan. Greetings, sir. I didn't even greet you. What are you up to? Nothing. I'm heading out for lunch. What's your friend's name? Samad, right? Are you meeting him? I'm already late, sir. Come on, Dan. It has been a while. Can't we just have a little chat? I have to go. Let's chat for a bit. I'm trying to be friendly here. How about I meet you at the restaurant? The three of us. What do you say? Hey, am I under arrest? What? Why would I arrest you? You didn't do anything wrong. Listen. Order takeout for me. Send it to the station, okay? Damn it! Take that, Bakri! Steady. Dan. You said 20 minutes. And I was sweating like crazy. I told you, I'm being watched. What do you mean? That Bakri is always tailing me. Bakri... Inspector Bakri? Why is he following you? That thing happened a long time ago. You tell me. I don't think I can do the job. Don't say that. This is the last one, Dan. There's no more after this. Please, Dan. I really need this. Can't you go solo? No way. We're in this together. We need each other. Please, Dan. I need to move out of this place. It's haunted. You're always high, aren't you? Chill, man. I haven't been high for the past three days. If I start getting high in this haunted place, I might end up jumping out the window. It's haunted, really. Haunted, haunted, haunted. What are you talking about? Your brain is demented. Anyway, we'll do it my way. Otherwise, you'll end up in jail, too. All right, Dan. Go. Dan, can I stay over at your place? Are you serious? Go back to your house! Fine. Hello. - Hi. - Hello. Hello. - Azman. - Mm. - Please come in. - How are you? Ah, this is for you. You shouldn't have. - Wow! - Hi. - Sorry. - Okay. - Was it easy to find the place? - Wow. - It's gorgeous! - It was not that difficult. - It's nothing special. - Azman. - How many rooms? - Nice house. - Three rooms. There's the storeroom. - We happened to see it while on the road. - You want a tour? Come. - Yeah, of course. It's a really nice place, actually. It's got a good view. This house has three rooms. We got a storage room, too. Oh. - This is a unique place. - We got some privacy. - I'll take you for a tour. - All right, Azman. - Sure, I'd love to. - Let's go. All right. I hope this is enough. - It's more than enough. - This is a lot. I made half and bought the other half. That's okay. You just moved in. Um, before we start, I'd like to introduce our new family member. This is Amar. Amar, where are you going? Su, just let him be, Huh? I think he's shy because of our guests. So don't force him, all right? Okay. Yeah, he's still very shy. He hasn't even warmed up to Azman yet. - Yup. - Ahh. It's fine. Take it slow, okay? I'm getting hungry now. Hey, don't say that. This isn't our house. It's okay. Let's start. Sorry. It is gray in color. - It hasn't been painted. - I see. Still the same color. With the color of the road. Uh, I'm going to go check on Amar. You carry on. Excuse me. All right. It's gray like the road, so you wouldn't notice... Amar. I'm coming in. Amar? Why is the door locked? Amar. - See you again. - Thanks for coming. Don't forget. It's our place again next time. All right. - He's going to treat you guys. - Let's go. - All right, see you, guys. - Yes. - Yeah. - Okay, bye. All right, bye. Azman? - Azman. - Mm. Azman, wake up. Mm-hm. There's a power outage. Go and check. Let it be. What can I do about it? Someone will fix it soon. Just open the window. I'm going back to sleep. Jeez. The lights outside seem fine. It's just our house. Azman. Amar? Amar? Amar. Where did you go? Amar? What's wrong, dear? Su. Su! Su? Hey! What's wrong, Su? Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? Eat up. Amar. Why did you do that? If you don't like it, tell me what you want to eat. Amar? What happened? Is that mine? Have you been taking your medication? - Um, about that... - Uh-huh. Well, I've actually stopped taking them the day we got Amar. Oh. And of course, I didn't think I needed it since Amar's presence heals me. Okay then. I heard the news from Azman. Congratulations. Thank you. It's a remarkable progress, but I think I really need your help. You do? Um, what is it? Okay. You have to continue with the medication. You can't just stop abruptly. Otherwise, you might suffer from side effects. And they can be severe. I didn't know about that. I know I have to finish them, but I didn't know the side effects can be so terrible. But I'm okay now, doc. I don't want it to affect my relationship with Amar. You know it when I'm medicated. I can get too drowsy. I'm starting to be a mother now, you know. Okay. I'll tell you what. I'll change your medication. Lower dosage that won't make you drowsy. It won't affect anything. But promise me that you'll finish the course, okay? Well, I guess so, yeah. - All right. - Thank you. Thank you. Uh... By the way, where's Amar? Oh, he's outside. Shall I get him? No, no, it's okay. I'll see him next visit. - Okay. - All right. All right. - Bye. - Thank you. Take care. Amar, go inside. I need to talk to Azman. Okay? What's wrong? What's wrong? Don't pretend like there's nothing going on. I'm okay. I'm good. From the day we took Amar in, you haven't even tried to talk to him. I haven't seen the two of you spending time together. Oh, no. I... Why is that? Uh, I, uh... I'm new at this. I'm just not used to it yet. This was your idea from the beginning. But now, you're ignoring him. At least talk to him about what happened during breakfast. Why are you doing this? Do it for me. How are we going to be a family? Su, I... You're not the only one affected by what has happened to us, okay? I felt the blow, too. I was also heartbroken. It was my child at the hospital, too. How am I supposed to know it can be this devastating? We suddenly have a child that's already grown up. What? Su! Su, listen to me. Su. Okay. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I, uh... I don't know what I was thinking. It's just that there are times when I can't think straight. Okay? I'm not perfect. But I will try my best. And I will talk to him, all right? Su? Sorry. Okay. Okay. But please don't get angry at him. Just ask nicely. All right. All right. No worries. I'm cool. Okay? POLICE STATION Sir. Bakri. What's the update on the recent jewelry shop robbery case? Uh, all the suspects are in custody. We're questioning them to find their leader. But they're still tight-lipped, though. What information do we have on the leader so far? Um, not much for now. We're positive that the mastermind behind this case is related to the case in Selayang last month. Are you focusing on your job, Bakri? Sir. I'm getting the pressure from the superiors over this case. We can't take too long to settle this. I want you to do your best to resolve this case by this month. Yes, sir. Close the Nur Azalea case. You don't have to go around stalking the suspects. A different branch is now handling the case. You must now focus on the current case. Yes, sir. Close the door. Call me if you need anything. Good night. Honey. According to this book, here are the best ways to communicate with a child who misbehaves. We should talk nicely and hug him. Say positive things. Hello? Hello, Su, I'm on my way home. Do you want anything from the store? Where are you? I'm in the car, of course. Do you want anything? There's someone in our house. Someone's trespassing! I heard him come in through the front door. - Call the police now! I'm almost-- - Okay, okay. Hello? Azman? Hello? Hello, 911. There's someone in my house. Uh, number 5, Taman Seri Cempaka 1. No! Jalan Seri Cempaka 1, Taman Seri Cempaka. Come quick! Here's my card. - You can call me. - Uh-huh. But for tonight, make sure all the doors are locked. Just call me if there's anything. Sure. Thanks. You just moved in, right? Yes. How do you know? I saw unpacked boxes. Yeah. You're right. Well, we should get going. Okay. - Thank you, Mr. Azman. - Thanks, sir. Ma'am. Are you sure someone came in? I know what I saw, Azman. All right, whatever it is, they've checked the house and found nothing. If there's anything, we can just call him. All right? There's something I need to tell you. But I need you to trust me. Okay. What's going on? After you called me, I heard a noise from the backroom. So, I went to check. I saw water and blood on the floor. What? What are you talking about, honey? Water? Blood? I don't know! Then I saw a woman outside. Then I heard your car, so I turned my back to look. When I looked back again, she was already standing right at the window. Su, I'm exhausted. You think I'm crazy? Hey, Samad. What's wrong? LET GO - Hey. - What if she comes to your house? What the hell is wrong with you, huh? - Let go. - Let go of whom? - She found me. - Hey, you... Damn it! What are you high on now? HELP Let her go. Damn it. This stuff again? No wonder you're getting worse! Come here! Get in! Get in there! - Sit down! - We have to let her go. We have to let her go. What are you talking about? Hm? Let go of what? How many times have I told you to stop sniffing that stuff? See what happened? You've gone insane now. Are you going to wait until you're dead? Please listen to what I have to say. What else do you have to say, huh? You were so high that you've started seeing all this. Just listen to what I have to say! Just because you think I'm high doesn't mean my stories aren't true! I'm not crazy even if I am high! Let's drop it. I don't want to hear your story. Huh? Listen, I'm telling you this one more time. You'd better stop smelling that thing. Otherwise, I'll stop helping you out. You're on your own. Dan. Dan. Hey. One more thing. Let's put our plan on hold. Dan... If you're still the same, it's canceled. Dan, Dan. Dan! What were you doing at that house, huh? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Hey, stop lying to me. - Sir. - Get in the car. That's an order! Hey. What the hell were you doing there? What else is unfinished? Any other evidence you're trying to cover, huh? As long as I'm alive, I am going to find Azalea. I'll make sure you receive a death penalty! Go and find it! Don't you understand? I had nothing to do with that case! There's no proof, right? You have no proof! Don't make me report your abuse of power! Until you have solid evidence, don't show your face again! Hey! You think I'm kidding? Amar. Pass the ball to me. Come on. Hurry up, come. Some time ago, I was not well. Dad took me to the hospital. At that time, I had a baby in my tummy. The baby lived in my tummy for a long time. At the hospital... The doctor said we couldn't bring the baby home. The baby was unwell. The baby had a better place to go to. I was devastated. But after adopting you, I'm not sad anymore. I'm very happy. I hope... you'll be patient with me. I'm okay. Go and play. Amar? Amar. Amar! Amar. Amar. Su. Su! Su, what happened? What the hell happened to you? Amar. - Amar? - No, no, no. Get up. - Where's Amar? - What's going on, Su? Goodness. Okay, sit down. - It's all right. - Where's Amar? Is he okay? He's fine. Su. Hey, tell me what happened. Su. Why were you on the floor? I don't know where to start. Okay, start with why you were on the floor. At least I know what's going on, huh. You slip? Did you bump into something? Why? Remember, last night, I told you about seeing a woman? Okay. That's why I said I don't know where to start. Okay, okay. Carry on. What happened next? I saw her again just now. While I was playing with Amar outside. The woman... I don't know if she's a woman. She looks like one, but... I'm not sure. But I did see her. Then when I looked back, she was gone. Then I looked in front of me, Amar was gone. I got up and searched for him... You still think I'm crazy. Su. Su, just listen to yourself. Huh? What do you expect? You want me to just accept what you're telling me? Is that it? I thought you'd be happier and better when we moved here. But it seems like your condition is getting worse! Bakri, come and see me. What is wrong with you? Didn't I tell you to drop the Nur Azalea case? - No, sir-- - A guy has to spend the night in jail! Please listen to what I have to say, sir. I received a report that a house was broken into. It was Nur Azalea's house but with a different tenant. So what about it? He's my suspect. A case like this suddenly resurfaced, so I went to question him. If he's not guilty, why must he be aggressive? You don't have any evidence. They're all circumstantial. You're basing it on a chain that he wore, that's all! Not even a fingerprint. Sir, I've been tailing the suspect for some time. I am not guessing, sir. You know how I work, sir. I wouldn't have proceeded without any solid proof. Bakri. You're one of our best, and I do trust you. But we have to act according to the law. The law requires solid evidence before you can put anyone as a suspect. If it were up to me, I'd like you to trail him to the end. But I am also bound by law. Here's the thing, sir. - I'm asking-- - I've approved your leave. What? Effective tomorrow, you're on paid leave for two weeks. Sir. Would you like a month? Or maybe six months straight? What about my cases? You don't have to think about them. I've got them covered. Hi, Mr. Azman. Grab a chair for him. How are you? Please have a seat. What can I help you with? Um... How are things at home? Everything's fine. But it's just... I don't know how to say this. To me, it may sound a little weird. Go ahead. Tell me. Okay. Lately, I've been really busy in the office. I'm not home most of the time. So, my wife has been alone at home. She told me she's been seeing a woman lurking around outside our house. Maybe it was this woman who broke in. Is this her? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF NUR AZALEA I have not seen her myself. Only my wife has. Why, sir? The lady in the photo is Nur Azalea binti Mazlan. She was reported missing six months ago, on October 2. We believe she was kidnapped. And she was a daughter of a millionaire, Datuk Mazlan, the CEO of Marintech. He left Azalea a sum of RM5,000,000 in inheritance, two months before her disappearance. I believe that she may have been blackmailed and murdered. Okay. But what does this have anything to do with me and my wife? The house you are living in... is the last place Nur Azalea was reportedly seen. In fact, the house is actually hers. Mr. Azman, can I see your wife? I want to confirm the identity of the woman. Sure. MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF NUR AZALEA DAUGHTER OF MARINTECH CEO BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED FOR INHERITING FAMILY'S WEALTH NUR AZALEA'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE SPARKS QUESTIONS ESTIMATED FIVE MILLION LEFT BY LATE FATHER How about this? We'll come back tomorrow night, around 8:00 p.m. I'll stay around a bit longer and observe thoroughly. We'll see if there's anything alarming. - I understand. - Mm. - I'm leaving now. - Sure. - Thank you. - You got it. - I'm sorry if I was a bit dull. - Don't sweat it, Mr. Azman. Okay. See you tomorrow? Uh, but what about me? - What about it? - Do you think we can sleep here tonight? Um, why can't you sleep here? It's your house. Just sleep here. This is your house, not otherwise. - Su, take him to his room. - Okay. Amar, go up to your room. I'll join you later. Azman. Huh? Is it really okay? So far, it's okay. There hasn't been anything. What about last night? For now, he said it's okay. He'll be back tomorrow. You can ask him yourself. Can we trust him? Yes. Hurry up, I'm scared. Su? Yeah? What is he up to? Azman, what's wrong? Just do as he says. Keep walking. Hey, where are you going? Over there. You see that? See that barrel? Go there. Open it. What? Open the barrel. My goodness. Azalea. You killed her? Shut up. You don't know anything, okay? I didn't kill her. Then how do you know she's here? You talk too much. Huh! Hurry, get her out! I can't. Her body is in pieces. That's why I brought the bag. Pick up the pieces and put them in the bag! Then bring her there and bury her. Hurry up! Su. Su. Su. Honey, are you okay? Honey! Yeah. Hurry. - Hello. - Hello. Uh, Inspector Bakri? - Who is this? - I'm Azman. We recently met at the police station. Mr. Azman, I'm a bit busy now. Can I call you back later? No. Sorry for bothering you, but a guy just who broke into my house. The guy asked me to tie my wife up, then forced me to bury Nur Azalea's body that I found in a tank at my house. Are you still busy, sir? I'm on my way now. - Nik! - Sir. What? What tank? What body? Whose body? - Tell me what's going on. - Okay, okay. Listen. Now go to the nearest police station. And then stay there till I come, all right? Inspector Bakri is on his way. And I'll wait for him, okay? No, wait. Just leave him, and we'll go out together. No, it's not as simple as you think, all right? Then tell me, what is it that's not so simple? We don't have time, honey. Just tell me. Shit. Okay. Okay. Before we moved in, a woman, Nur Azalea, used to live in this house. She lived here with her son. Okay? Five or six months ago, she disappeared without a trace. I just found her in the tank at the back of our house. That guy ordered me to bury her body around the tank. You got it now? I don't know why! Okay? So, now, please... Go to the nearest police station. And stay there. Do not ask me anything else, all right? Okay, I'll go and get Amar. No! No, Su. You're not listening to me. Remember I told you she had a son? Her son's name is Amar Affendi. The lady in the photo is Nur Azalea binti Mazlan. She was reported missing six months ago, on October 2. After Azalea's disappearance, Amar was taken to the orphanage. He died there. Doctor, you know that we went to the orphanage for adoption, but we didn't manage to adopt. But we weren't allowed to adopt a kid. Your application has been rejected. One of the criteria for adoptive parents is that they must have good mental health. I hope you can understand. Doctor, she acted like a child came home with us. She opened the car door and talked as if there were a kid in the backseat. But there was no one there. The backseat was empty. Honey, we don't have a son. What are you saying? We have a son. How can you say that? No! Don't say it. Su, look. Look at the boy. Are you seeing the same boy? If you want to, you can also call me "Mom." And it's the same for Uncle Azman. You can call him "Papa" if you want. But I think he prefers "Daddy." I'd like to introduce our new family member. This is Amar. Amar, where are you going? Why did you do that? If you don't like it, tell me what you want to eat. I didn't see anything! But I can't say a word to her, although she might notice. You can't just stop abruptly. Otherwise, you might suffer from side effects. And they can be severe. I didn't know about that. Are you seeing the same boy? - No! No, no! - Don't be obsessed. Su! Amar. Mama. Amar... This is your room. It's big, right? You can do your drawing here. I got you a table. Pass the ball to me. Come on. Hurry up, come! I'm okay. Su! Call your wife! Call her! Hurry up! Or I'll shoot! Woman! Come out now, or I'll shoot your husband! Come out! Come out! - Hey! - Su. Su. Come out here! Su? Honey. Honey. Honey. Honey. The plan is all in my head. It's not that complicated. We just wait until they leave, then we break in. Then we hide. Huh. When they return, you grab the girl and lock her up. And I'll grab the kid. Then we'll ask them for money. Once we get the money, we'll let them go. What are you doing? I'm hungry. Have some. - It hurts! - Shut up! Help! Son of a bitch! - Why were you thinking? - She was trying to escape! We're screwed! What are you going to do now, huh? What's your plan? Subtitle translation by Norazah Abdul Aziz
