Well let's get these people from street. This is not a circus. I will provide. All right, everyone is going home! Go home now. There is nothing to see. - See you later. - In the bedroom. Give me the bottle, Wally. Please, not on the street. "Are you, Brutus?" Attention, ladies and gentlemen. It is just an introduction to the massacre ... which you can witness. For these are difficult times and Cesar will make an offering to the gods. Adults, 25 cents and soft drinks. Get up. Come on, get up! Move yourself! Well, what can I do? Do it for you guys? Show us how fast you can ride your horse and get out of town. I'm leaving soon after the trial. of Mr Holland. There is no need for a trial. - The District Judge will be here soon. The Judge may continue his itinerary, because we will not need it. "Well, we have a deal, Reggie. "A bargain with a bastard is not worth anything. Secretly, he can run away with the money, before facing Holland. What are you going to do? What do you plan? Kill it? "He's going to kill the girl and kill him." - Shut up!

" "But at the moment when looked smiling on my face, ... " "the breast would remove him from the toothless mouth ... " and the head would break, if so had sworn it. " "Just as you in relation to this. " "May I be damned!" - Macbeth too. Oh, my God, Bess! I've never seen anything like it. You're the only one. Tell me, what does that mean? It means that when proposing to do something, do it. Was Starret right? Like me, Did you need a platform? He was drunk. Harry, be honest with yourself, and this will follow day and night. Do not lie and do not fight it. Holland! What the hell do you want now? Let me arrest you and you'll be safe. until the Judge judges it. Sam, you know I will not have chance with a Judge of this city. "A Judge will come from Union Wells." "A week's trip?" You're arriving tomorrow morning by train. You will have a fair trial. I promise you that. I'll think about it. "I heard that Harry Holland is here." "That's right. "Is he in prison?" "Not yet, but it will be soon." Good. Merritt, I'm Wally Blodgett, the Delegate ...

He raped, robbed, plundered and killed. The indulgence of you means betraying the aspirations of this great country. May God judge you. Harry Holland, I condemn you to be hanging by the neck, until death. Those are fine words, but I think Mr Holland has heard them before. He will not give up his freedom, to be judged by the Lord. "Does he know I'm here?" - Yes. So how are we gonna take it? of that Hotel? Let's have a duel. If he wins, he will be free. If he loses, he will be justified. I'll face it tomorrow morning.
