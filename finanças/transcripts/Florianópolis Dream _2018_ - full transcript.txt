Ask for one for four people. Do you have one available for four people? I only have double rooms. Rooms for two people. - Two rooms for two people. - It's more comfortable. Yeah, but it's better if it's only one room, so... It's only for one night and we'll save some money. No, do you have one for four? One room for four people? We want to sleep together. The four of us. We're a family. We're a family and we all want to sleep together. What I can offer is to put two mattresses in a double room. And it will be charged as a double room? I should charge you more since there are four people in one room. - Yes. - But I won't. - Okay. - I don't get it. - No. - Yes, thank you so much. - Where shall I leave this? - The key. Oh, the key, grab the key. Every cloud has a silver lining. It's horrible, but it's cheap, guys. And all the same I've brought here... What have you brought? [sprays repellent] Spraying this, we'll be safe. Are you guys sleeping here? You and mom sleep here. And we'll sleep over here, on the floor, I don't know. Why? Bugs don't bite you if you're a man? Cut it off! It's just for one night. Yeah, but it's disgusting! Okay, I'll sleep on the floor, you can sleep over there. - It's only for tonight. - I'll spray more. No, it's enough. - It's so humid. - Let's go outside. Yeah, you guys go outside, go outside. Get out of here guys since it's all... This place stinks. You can hardly breathe in here. From Argentina? Yes, from Argentina. Brazilian? - Yes,from Biguaçu - Biguaçu, nice to meet you. What happened? You got lost? - Sorry? - Did you get lost on your way? No, we ran out of gas. You're probably going to Florianopolis. Yes, exactly. Why is it that all Argentineans are coming to Brazil? Aren't there any beaches there? No, they're prettier here. - Help me. - The woman's going to see us. I don't give a fuck. Don't laugh. [background radio] We're almost there. ♪ ["Castelhana" by Elton Saldanha] ♪ [all chanting] Brazil, Brazil, Brazil...

Let me just talk with my husband for a second. Oh, you're here. I don't think so, right? Well... Aren't you going to have a look? Aren't you going to take a look? Thank you, we'll think about it. Maybe some other time. Thank you so much. - Thank you so much, - Be careful with your head. Hello, Marco? Hello? How... How are you? It's Lucrecia, the Argentineans you saved on the road. Do you want me to talk? Right! Yeah! We just arrived. In... At the square that's on the way to the beach? Which is opposite a church. Morro do Muquem, Morro do Carregador, Morro... There are millions of them. It's Morroland. - Yes, that's him. - Him? Let me... - Hi! - Hello! Let's not take anything else. We can go. We have to walk there. We'll come back later. - Are we going to make two trips? - Yes. - Is it very far? Then when you need your stuff, you can come back for it, and then go back to the house. You're going to find the place to be marvelous. - It's gorgeous. - No, that's mine. - How many blocks to the beach? - It's only a few blocks. - Look, the cassettes. - Come on guys, get a move on. - Did you lock your car? - Those cassettes are mine.

Yes, because we're going to take that road. - See it? - Take your shoes off. - We're going across the river? Yes, it's on that trail. This is pure nature! Clean beach, clear water, white sand! The moon is marvellous! We also have a karaoke bar here. It's very good. - Karaoke? - Yes, and I sing. You want me to sing? I want you to go there and I'll sing for you. - Be careful! - There's no danger here. - Be careful... - Ouch! Here! Follow me. We're going to go up here and take that path over there. - Marco? - Yeah? Can we get to Bombas and Bombinhas from here? Yes. You can get there, yeah. Can we get to the island from here? Yes, by boat or kayak. - Thank you! - Tante grazie. [Pedro] It's so hot! [Flor] Look where we took you to celebrate your birthday! What the eyes don't see the heart doesn't feel. - Do you like Brazil? - Yes, we like it a lot. We took advantage of the good exchange rate to come. You speak Portuguese well. Where did you learn it? I'm a huge fan of Brazil. Huge fan. We were lucky that our teenage kids accepted to come with us. Hey Anderson! How's it going? It's been so long, buddy! How's it going? You haven't been around in while, why? - I got a job on the beach. - Oh yeah? Great. You can keep going. We're almost there. Oh, thank God. No, no, no, that's not it. It's not here. This way. Not here. We have to keep walking down this path. - Come on. - Where? I live in the white house but I'll stay in the pink house so you can use the white one. Wait a minute, I don't understand. We're staying here? No. I'm staying in the pink house, and you're staying in the white one. It's bigger, better equipped. - It's where I live. - That one, that one's ours. - And he's staying in this one. - But there's no need. - We can stay there too. - No. I'm used to it. This is what I live on, renting houses. I'm very happy to see you again. Because yesterday on the road, I was very sad, truly sad. Because my best friend passed away. Me too, a very close friend of mine passed away very recently. Friends are like brothers, right? - Can we leave our things here? - Yes. I hadn't realized you were so young. What? No, no, no. I'm not that young, but... Genes help. - Great genes. - Thank you. - Not to the kids, right? - Yes, a little for the toast. - Cheers, to love. - Cheers. To Maradona. Maradona? Who's that? Let's keep going... - To Maradona. - Who's that? - Garrincha, yeah? - Isn't it Pele? Pele too, but Garrincha is our pride and joy. This is it. Back here you have umbrellas. Excuse the mess here. Over there is the kitchen. And on this bed here, I was conceived. Who? I was conceived on that bed, can you believe that? - You? - Yes. You and I are going to sleep here, okay? Here's the bathroom. Let's see. - There's a couch over there. - Oh, I'm sorry. Carol. - Hi, how're you? - Hi. - She's Carol, a friend. I'm sorry. No don't worry! I'm the one who's sorry, I'm dying my hair. But here we're used to tourism. - We are. - Thank you. That's the kitchen, and over there is the bunk bed. Two beds. - Then we'll have bunk beds. - Yeah, it's okay, right? You guys can go to the beach for a while. We're staying here. I'll take a few things out and take them to the other house. - Enjoy and then come back. - But shall we settle in first? No, no, not now. Now you guys go to the beach, enjoy. Come back in two hours. In the meantime, I'll organize things here. I'll take things to the pink house where I'm staying. No, I'd rather settle in first and then go to the beach. No, no, no, now. Go to the beach, have fun there. Splash around for a while and then come back. I'm not asking, it's an order. See you. [Flor] No, no, no, no, no! No! No! No! There was an insane guy chasing me with a fish this big. - There was one who was... - It was this big! I don't know, I don't like it there. Why don't you... We can put it between the disks, mom. Or inside one of them. Or two. Choose two disks... What about these? "Angelica" and "Modernisimo". Yes, perfect. Put this in "Modernisimo." - Okay. - This one in "Angelica". - Great. - The pillow case. Thank you. - Sleep well. - You too. Bye. [acoustic guitar playing] [acoustic guitar playing] [Julian and Flor] Dad didn't fill the tank And he eats shrimps... And there's a horrible house Hey, it's pretty good, dude. Let's go again. Dad didn't fill the tank And he eats shrimps Dad didn't fill the tank And we were stuck In the middle of the road Dad didn't fill the tank... Wait. Here, Dad didn't fill the tank... And he eats shrimps Want to go have some ice cream? All right. Or cake? Either, I don't care. I think I feel like having cake. Or ice cream. I don't know. What do you want? Cake? Ice cream? Coffee? - Ice cream. - What do you feel like? What flavor does my girl want? - Whatever they have. - Zabaione? - I'll go and grab an umbrella. - Okay. [screaming] What's wrong? - Hit it. - Don't scare it. - It's a rat. - Get it out of here. - It looks like a rat. - Careful! Careful! Get it out of here! - Where is it? - It's here! It's down here. Bastard! You're going to hit my head, dad! It's not a rat, it's an opossum! It's because there's food in the house! Yes it's an opossum. We need to be quiet because if you hit him he'll pee and the whole house will smell like opossum. Okay, silence, he said. - It's open. - It's not coming out. Make sure it gets out. I didn't see it. - It left, it left. - It has left. - It left? - It's gone away. It's gone. Gone. Close the door. Close it so that it won't come back in. - Don't let it back in. - Oh no, but is it gone? - It's gone, it's gone. - Are you sure? What was it? A rat? - No, it was an opossum. - What? Opossum. What do you call it in Spanish? Us men slept on the top and bottom beds, and the women in the master bedroom. - Top and bottom. - Beliche. - Bunk beds. Oh, you call them "beliches" in Portuguese? We call them bunk beds. Well, we sleep there and the women sleep in the master bedroom. - So you don't sleep together? - No. No, we're going through a particular time. At this particular moment we're not living together as a couple in Buenos Aires. We live apart. How does that work? I have a bed in the office where I work and I sleep there. But we eat together almost every day. - Every day? - Basically, yeah. So... Are you together or separated? Good question, Marco. Technically, we're separated. - Technically. - Separated. And did you meet as kids? No, we met as adults. They had me when they were really old, so from my class, from all my friends, they're the oldest parents. - Don't say we're old. - Mature. It's not a bad thing. They're the oldest parents at school. Ah, yes, okay. Marco, they're like us when we separated. You guys look like us in the future. In the future? Like, they're you guys in the future. - Exactly. - What? I don't understand. - Oh, you guys are separated now? - Yes. Oh, but it's not the same situation, because we're still thinking things through. We're thinking things through, evaluating the situation, seeing what happens. Right? Something like that. Do you have any beer here? - Yes, we bought some. - Could we have one? - Of course! - I'll go get some. Only one, Marco. I have to get up early. - You have to work. - Yes. I can't stand hangovers. How do call it in Argentina when you drink a lot and wake up... - Resaca, the same as here. - Oh, resaca? - It's also resaca? - Yes, resaca. - You also like it? - Yes, and you? Hey friends! How are you? How was the trip? How was the excursion? - So, so... - Did you like it? Yes. And tomorrow morning we have a water adventure. Something really big happened to me with Cesar just now. What happened? - Who's Cesar? - Marco's son. I felt like... We just couldn't take our eyes off of each other. I don't know if he felt it too. You'll figure it out... You didn't notice... that I was into him? No... - I'm going to get it, I will. - It's very good! Let's go, Samba! [samba music] Very good! The excursion... - It's unforgettable! - I'll get the hang of it. Unforgettable! You'll never forget it. It's nice, right? - Let's go! - Beautiful. - Thank you. - Careful! Careful! - Hello, hello, hello! - Hello, how was it? Let's go! [chanting] Come on! - Hello! - Let's go, Flor. I have this friend who has some new music. He wants to show me his new song. Maybe we can go and learn to play it like did the other day. We can go play it like we did yesterday. - Now? - Yes, do you want to? [samba music] [samba music] Slow down! [samba music] [samba music] [samba music] [muffled laughter] - Did you like it? - Yes, but... But that's the fun part. If I tell you beforehand... If you had told us before that you were going to throw us into the water... If I tell you beforehand there's no surprise, and that's the fun part. You'll laugh about it tomorrow! - Lucrecia, did you like it? - Yes, but... Well, there you go! Lucrecia liked it! Adventure, understand? - My wife was scared. No, were you scared? A little bit, a little bit. - You should have told us. - You'll laugh about it tomorrow. Isn't there a phone here? No sweetie, you know, it seems there's no phone here. I'd like to call Lauti, what should I do? Well... a call shop, right? Look for a call shop. I thought a house was supposed to have a phone. But there isn't, there is no phone. - Shall I help you with that? - No, thanks. It's done. Go ahead. Ready? - Ready. - Wait, there's a little left. Done. - Are you okay? - Huh? - Are you okay? - Yes. Can we talk for a minute? - Yes. - Outside? - Yes. - Let's go. Good luck. We should go out on a ride one of these days, go on a day trip, take advantage of the fact that we're here, right? Let's meet up here for a while after the kids are asleep. Pedro... We can go to the island, alone. Tomorrow, or the day after. Well, I don't know if I'll feel like it then, we'll see. All right, we'll see. What? Did you get upset because I said I didn't feel like it? Why would I get upset if you don't want to go to the island? Pedro, this is another Florianopolis, completely different from the previous one. You don't even have to say it, Lucrecia. That's what I meant. - Bye, mom. - Bye, sweetheart. Bye. - Bye, honey. - Bye. Bye! - Mom is right, guys. - What? We are carrying too much stuff, let's leave it here. - This one. - No, where will we sit? - Leave that board, go, leave it. - No, I have to take it. - Okay. - Come on, let's go. Let's go, come on. I'm taking the rubber dinghy. What else do you want? [background radio] [Marco] We'll talk later, okay? [bossa nova music] Bye, bye. I'll wait for you, okay? Lucrecia! We're all friends here! Oh... Yes, I can see that. Why didn't you guys go to the karaoke bar? What? You guys didn't go to the karaoke last night, why? Oh, right. Before heading back to Buenos Aires we'll go to hear you sing. - Promise? - Yes, promise. Do you want a cold beer? No, no, thank you, no, no. All right, if you want some cold beer I have some here. Just ask me, okay? Bye. Are you sure? - No, thank you! - They're very cold. I'm resting. All right. What do you call people who drink beer all day? What? What do you call people who drink beer all day? Brazilian! Okay... - I'm going to rest for a while. - Okay. If you change your mind the beer is here, ready for you, okay? You should rest too. Me? No... The last thing I want in life is rest. I want to enjoy time, I want to enjoy life. I'm at a very good point in my life, Lucrecia. Everything in my life is going well. My son, my parents, they're alive. My parents! I might later regret the things I didn't do. Because everything can change... You know? I only understood half of that, but I might accept a beer. I'll go get one then. - Now? - Yes, I'll get one for you. Come, come here, come. - I'll be right there. - Freezing cold, come on! - I'll be right there. - Okay. Hey. - Wait a minute. - All right. Here. - Cheers. - Cheers. I want to invite you to go for a walk to a place you won't regret. I didn't get that, what? I want to invite you to go for a walk. Yes, I understood for a walk. And after that? An unforgettable place. - Should we go? - Let's go. - Not the karaoke bar, right? - No, karaoke night is on Friday. - Friday? - Yes, Friday. Is there any other way to go than walking by the beach? Yes, we can go that way. That way is shorter. - Would you prefer that? - Yes. Ok. Yes, it's better... [Lucrecia] Incredible. The color of the water, everything is beautiful. I don't usually go to... the lookout points to see the view, instead I like to... enjoy the view as I go. But well, lately... I'm... I'm really appreciating being able to... - Just stop, you know? - Stop? - Just stopping, in every sense. - Oh, yeah. Sometimes I think about my son, Cesar. He doesn't know what he wants to do in life. And it's difficult to be out in the world if you don't have a profession. Can you talk more slowly for me to understand you better? Yes, I'm sorry. I'm saying... I'm saying I wanted him to decide on a profession. Understand? I don't know, sometimes I think it's... That when you're young, you know... you think you won't be so traditional when you have kids, and you won't... expect them to follow all the steps. Yes, for kids to tick off all the boxes. Got it. High school, university, postgraduate degree... Did you study anything, Lucrecia? Yes, yes. I studied Psychology. I'm a psychoanalyst. - And so is Pedro. - Pedro too? Both of us. Maybe it's generational, right? This is beautiful. What a place! I like you. Thank you. I'm trying to think of something to say. You don't have to say anything. Well, I have to get going, because... I'm going to walk back along the beach so I can... buy some camera rolls. Since the exchange rate is in my favor. Of course. Let me help you. [bossa nova music] [bossa nova music] Water! Pedro! You smell like beer. You're drinking like a Viking! That's what holidays are for. Otitis! Flor, Flor, otitis! [samba music] [screaming] [Marco] Hey, my friends! [screaming] [samba music] Yesterday I fell asleep on the beach. Perfect. And now my entire body is sunburned. All of it. Look. Do you have any lotion? Pain relieving lotion. "You snooze, you lose." I have some, I'll go get it. Thank you so much. - It's true. - The lotion was at home. If you'd come to the beach this wouldn't have happened. Towels, how many towels are we taking? I'm going to do my thing too. Oh! Look where the acetone was... - Separate vacations? - Cut it out! Yeah, stop it because it's not convenient for you. - You really bore me. - So do you. This discussion we have about who's nicer, who does more things for the relationship. A couple that is not a couple... [man yelling] - The Benitez! - Who? Facundo and Karina. My patient and your former patient! - Where? - They're here! Duck! They're right there! Duck! Don't let them see us! Damn it! How come whenever we're on vacation a patient shows up to ruin it? [Facundo] You wanted to come to Brazil, You are in Brazil! And I'm the one who does not let you live? [Pedro] They're gone. They're gone, you can get up. Weren't the kids going to come help us? They slept in. All they do is sleep. - Are you going to be okay? - Yes, I'll be fine. Want me to grab one of the bags? No, no thank you. Damn it. - Give me a bag. - No, take my flip-flops. Can you manage? Wait. Let's go. So, did you guys have a nice little trip today? - Yes. - Where have you been? Around. The lotion will kick in, dad, don't make that face. It hurts me as well but I don't... What face am I making? My face is the usual one. I'm fine, don't worry guys, I'm fine. Come on, I'm clearing the table. Smile a little. No one's worried. What do you mean? - Pineapple or peach? - Peach, pineapple. - No, peach. - Pineapple or peach? Whichever, it's the same. And you? Pineapple. Why don't we do something? Shall we go to the karaoke bar tomorrow? I can perfectly go to the karaoke bar tomorrow. I don't understand why Julian and dad have to sleep in separate beds and we have to sleep in the double bed. Because they don't rent houses filled with single beds. Well, I guess there's a reason for that. Flor, come on! Help us a bit! Vacations aren't meant to help. - No? - No. Okay, great. Then from now on I'm not going to help either. It's over, I won't help anymore. From now on you cook your own meals, you do the shopping, you carry the containers. - It is not comparable, mom. - Shut up and go to sleep! It doesn't matter where you are going to sleep. There are other things that matter. That we can enjoy, feel what surrounds us, nature, the air, oxygen, the sea, the sand! That's what's really worth it! Hey, I'm feeling a bit down. I want to go to Bombas and Bombinhas. Julian, stop talking about it, and just go. The one who was there is Benitez. He told me he was going there with his wife and in laws. - Who's Benitez? - And now I find him here. - But who is he? - A patient, honey. Yeah, but wait a minute, a patient? Not any patient, a patient... Quite a crazy man your dad helped out of a rough spot. The one who used to eat match heads? No, that's another one. His wife was also quite neurotic. You did a great job with her. What, you knew him? Both of them. Poor guys... Poor both of them. Wait, I don't get it. You treated his wife and dad treated him? - Right. - Isn't that illegal? - No, it's not illegal. - Sorry to bother you. I wanted you to meet my friend, Fernando. A close friend of mine. I'm going to go say hi. Everything okay, Pedro? I get that we're in Brazil, with the tropical climate, the heat, but this guy's wearing Sunga briefs all day long. - Hi, how are you? - Everything's fine. - Nice to meet you, I'm Fernando. - Thank you, everything's good. If you need anything you can talk to him. Fernando and I have the same job. He takes care of everything around here, including me. If you need anything just let me know. Marco told me you're a psychologist. - Yes, yes. - Oh, interesting. Oh, you told them. Yes. - Okay, okay, all right. - Anything you need, let me know. - Have a nice time. - Thank you, thank you. Pedro, kids! Bye. Bye, see you later. The guy who wanted the other house, he's a psychologist too? No, he's a psychiatrist. - It's not the same thing, right? - No, he gives you medications. No! Let's get wet! The water's lovely, kids. Get in. Look at that wave! Where did you put the money? - In the disk. - But in which one? In a disk called "Modernisimo." -"Modernisimo?" - Yes. It's over there. One that has people on the cover. What a lovely night! Look at this! If Sunga invites us to sit at his table we say no thank you and sit at our own. Pedro! We can't tell him that. Everything's alright. Relax. We rented Sunga's house not Sunga himself. Hey, family! How are you guys? - I'm glad you came. - I hadn't seen you. Hey, Pedro! How's it going? Have a sit. We finally came, I told you we would. Sit down, please. - How are you? - Fine and you? I'm glad you came. Yes, we wanted to. [samba music] [samba music] Beer? [samba music] [Lucrecia] Some people say you should even wash them with a bit of bleach. - Bleach? - Bleach. What is bleach? How can I explain? Bleach... - Like a disinfectant. - Oh, yes. But that scares me, I'm afraid I'll put on too much... - And harm someone, yeah. - Yes. Do you remember that you read the other day that it could take up to thirty years to eradicate it completely? No, I wasn't listening, I don't know what you're talking about. About cholera. Marco was telling me that he read, yesterday, that in Salta there have been over thirty cases? No, one hundred cases. One hundred cases! Of Cholera. In Salta. In Argentina! Unbelievable. Those are diseases related to poverty. It has to do with that. A country full of misery, right? - Yes. -"Miserability?" - How do you say it? - No, misery. - Misery, yeah. - Miserability is something else. I'm going to go get a caipirinha. Thank you. - Hello, Pedro. - All good? All good. - All good. - Yes. - Pretty night. - Yes, it's nice. - Very nice. - Very. [cheering] People! I was doing really well at home, but I'm doing even better here! [laughter] To end the night with a bang, I invite Marco to sing... "A Castelhana." Marco, please, leave everything up there! Let it go! ♪ ["Castelhana" by Elton Saldanha] ♪ Today I'm off to the border Because I'll see my baby Whether I like it or not I've been waiting for The whole week To see my Castelhana My dearest flower It's so cold in the city Too cold for my liking I must say South of my heart I want to have a good time Only you can provide South of my heart I want to have a good time Only you can provide Leave it all behind And come with me Let's see danger in the face Leave it all behind And come with me Let's see danger in the face Castelhana, if you do love me Do love me Just say so Castelhana, if you do love me Do love me We can be happy together [cheering] [guttural screaming] - It's a theater group. - They dance. They do this type of dance. They're very funny, cheerful. Yes. - It's very nice. - Your smile is very nice. Your smile. - Fernando. - Lucrecia, Marina, Angelica. - We've been talking. - Your faces are very similar. He says you're very similar. - Yes, I understood. - I don't think so. You're more beautiful. Did you understand that? Marco, you sang today... I couldn't hear the feedback very well. But you sing better than that. I was a bit nervous. You were good, but you've been better. Yeah, Fernando. - Fernando is a good friend. - I didn't understand. A great friend. I didn't understand, what did he say? He said that... It's nothing, don't worry about it. There's a lot of stuff in here because people leave more and more things behind now. - It looks like a warehouse. - Yes. The other way around too. More and more people are taking things. Argentineans, for example, take things as souvenirs. To take as a reminder. No, but... No, because us Argentineans like taking mementos from the houses, towels... Soaps... - Right. - Spoons... They even took the toilet seat. - Can you believe that? - Really? And... do you steal too? - What? - Do you steal too? Do you steal? - No. - No? Only when I'm hungry. When I'm hungry, I do. This way. Ouch! Hold on. [background radio] [background radio] Good morning... Hi. Everything alright? I'm going home. I have to swing by later to get some papers. - What? - I have to get some papers. Yeah... "My house is your house." [funk music] - Bye. - Bye. [funk music] I'm sorry... I was putting a little color on it. For my hair. - Do you like it? - It looks good. Bye. Excuse me. I want you to know that it's nothing personal. It's not about anything in particular that has happened. You know that I've always liked traveling with you guys and being together, but... I prefer being over there. And you insisted on a family trip for your birthday and all... Let's see, Julian. Go, Julian. The truth is you've always been very clear with us, you've told us what you wanted, even before leaving Argentina you were saying... that you were thinking about Bombas and Bombinhas... And we were the ones who didn't listen to you. I'm very happy to hear you say that because honestly it felt like you didn't want to hear what I had to tell you. - How could I not listen to you? - That's what it seemed. - You guys are idealists. - Not at all. You're always trying to live up to what you imagine... It's not like that. Let me tell you something. I have the theory that that's idealism. Listen, that theory is wrong. - You are the idealist... - Me? Not at all. Thinking that we have a plan set in stone... - It's not like that. - It's not exactly like that. - Yes it is like that, Flor. - No, I'm having more fun now. I mean, maybe you go to Bombas and Bombinhas and it won't be that fun. - You're having fun with Cesar. - What? What's wrong with you, jerk? Since we're having this family chat... The truth is, I'm a bit worried. - Worried about what? - I'm worried about you. Basically all you do is go after boys. - Oh, stop it. Stop it! - You don't do anything else. Cesar, Lautaro... - Flor... Flor... - What? What your dad is trying to say, as brutally honest as he was, is that we're worried about how dependent on men you are. - You give men all the power. - Yeah. When it's not with Lauti it's with this kid... This kid is called Cesar, first of all. Well, with Cesar, whatever his name is, it's like that. It's like that. What are you trying to say, mom? Are you kidding me? - Wait, Flor, tell me about it. - I'm trying to talk to you. - You're not talking nicely. - Please, tell me about it. What's this relationship with the Brazilian kid about? Because you don't try to hide it. It's noticeable. So did you break up with Lautaro? Do I have to explain myself to you? Wait, listen to me, the only thing we want is for you to study, develop as individuals... What are you trying to say? That what I'm doing is wrong? Is that it? No, honey, what you're doing is not wrong... Flor! [Pedro] I'm so stupid. Yes, you are stupid. And the worst part is that you have double standards to treat him or her. - That's what you do! - With whom? And you only do it with the kids because you don't apply it to yourself! - What are you talking about? - You heard me! Since I also want to be autonomous and independent, like you said... I'm going to go to Bombas and Bombinhas autonomously and independently. But I don't want you to take offense or anything. It's not because of you, it's because... I want to leave. I want to be over there. I'm sorry I'm not going to be here for your birthday. Bye. [guitar playing live] From all of us. The good thing about having two birthday parties is that I can make lots of wishes. - That's right. - You wish so many things? Wasn't it bad luck to celebrate your birthday in advance? Well, then on the 25th there will be another cake and more wishes. And do you wish anything for me? Yes, that you do great in Bombas and Bombinhas. Thank you. Can I take the camera with me? Bye, mom. Happy birthday. - Bye, Flor, see you later. - Bye, dude. - Bye, dad. - Did you pack enough clothes? I've got two shirts and a swimsuit. - A coat? - It's not cold. - The weather's nice over there. - All right... Bye, have a good trip, bye. - Good afternoon. - Hello... - How are you? - Did Juli leave? - Yeah, he just left. - How are you? - Good. - How are you, good? - Good. - Is everything okay with you? I closed on two houses today. Some people arrive, some people leave. Some people come, others leave... - Okay... - Flor, want to go to the beach? I'm going to the beach. All right, go. - Good afternoon. - Bye. - Bye. When is he coming back? When is Juli coming back? We can go by the beach or take the trail. That way we'll go past the house. - But the house is right there. - Wait until you see the place. Okay. - Well? - Good. It's nice. [Karina] Leave me! [Facundo] But where are you going, Karina? I want to go and live. I want to live! I can't live like this! You won't let me talk, You won't let me live! I'm the one who's not letting you live? Now I'm the problem? What are the Benitez doing here? I've told you a thousand times that I want to have a good time, but it's impossible! - What's the problem? - It's impossible! - Come here! - I told you I didn't want to! I told you I wanted to go over there, you said no, that you didn't get the message, that you... Poor them... [Pedro laughs] Hey, I'm going to stay around here for a while, okay? Alone. I'll see you at home later. [Larissa] ÷}Are you better now? - Is it better? - Yes. [Flor] I feel weird, you know? But I'm okay. If you need anything you should go to a doctor. - Hi! - Hello! - Hi! - How are you? - All good? - All good. I'm arriving uninvited, am I interrupting anything? No, welcome. Sit down, please. Were you chatting? - Yes. - Yes. I was telling Flor, that when Cesar was born Marco and I had been separated for about a year. And... Because Cesar is the son of a woman Marco had a short relationship with, after we separated. - Oh, Cesar is not your son? - No. At first it was very difficult for me, because I really wanted to have a child with Marco. But... Now he's here. Beautiful. I love him! Life does whatever it wants with us, right? So... Everything is alright. Would you like a caipirinha? Here you go, thank you. - There you go. - Thank you. - All right, all right, bye! - Bye! See you soon. - Lucrecia. - Yes? Do you like oysters? Yes. If you want some, let me know because I have a friend who has the best oyster restaurant in town. And you can set something up with him. - Oh, okay, okay. - Yeah? - I'm going home because... - Yeah, yeah. It's cold, right? I want to be at home. All right, bye! - And where's Pedro? - He went on a walk alone. He wanted to be by himself. Oh, yeah, a solitary afternoon. - Yeah! - Bye! - Goodnight. - Bye. [guitar playing live] [indistinct dialogue] - Bye, kids, I'm leaving. - Mom? Do you know anything about Juli? Absolutely nothing. He's with his friends, who don't have a phone. - I'm absolutely disconnected. - All right. Okay. Um... I might... We might leave as well. To one of his friends'house on the continent for a day. One of my friends... To one of my friends'house. Okay, let us know. - I'm letting you know now. - Okay. Bye. Bye. Again. [singing in Portuguese] [tumbling] [door slamming] Hello? [Pedro] Good night... Ouch, jeez! No... No, no, no. No? No? No, no, no? - Stop it. Stop it! - Don't throw water at me. Oh, look! Stop it! Are you going out? Oh, yeah. Do you know anything about Flor? No, she's been with Cesar all day. - Where are you going? - To a restaurant. To eat oysters. No, it's reserved because you're staying here for fifteen days. [man] They're going to Rio and I want to go too. And what do I have to do with that? And what do I have to do with you leaving to Rio? Pay the fifteen days and you can go to Rio or wherever you want. And if I suddenly wanted to go to New York, and I went to New York, I'd close the door and leave. And I'd leave you in the middle of the street. How's that? - We'd understand. - How would you understand? You confirmed fifteen days! Hi, Lucrecia. - Everything good? - Yes. - Corn? - No, no, thank you. We're going to wait. Marco is pretty nervous. We're going to wait for him to calm down. - Can you do me a favor? - Yes. I brought some money because I need to change reals. I don't have any money left at all. - I want to see Rio. - Why should I care? What do I have to do with you wanting to go to Rio? You have to be more flexible, Marco. Flexible? I have a contract with the owner of the house. We agreed on fifteen days. - No, no I can't. - Listen, Marco, I'm not going to pay for something I'm not going to use. But you have to pay! The city is full of tourists. Two hundred. I'll give you ten more later. Yes, yes, okay. Thank you. Lucrecia! I just saw two turtles swimming together. The water is cold... But it's delicious. - Aren't you cold? - No. - I'll see you later. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. [whistling] Let's go out for dinner tonight. A Toca da Garoupa. Remember? That restaurant we went to last time. Oh, the one with the boats? The boats, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah? [bossa nova music] Thank you. I am completely set on... starting swimming lessons once we get back. I know it's going to be hard with winter and everything, but I want to get it done. I need to feel I know how to swim. I... wanted to tell you... That will help me. Even if it is only for the sake of that, it will be useful. That... I feel attracted to... Larissa. Um... We went out for dinner. Then we made love. Later tonight, I'll probably stop by her house... when her shift at the bar is over. I have to take this opportunity now because she's only staying for a week. Then she goes to Saão Paulo to see her mom and when she gets back we'll be... - It's fine. - It's now or never. I thought that... It's fine, It doesn't matter, it's fine. You have every right to. Larissa is... I was not going to share this with you. She's a great swimmer. Actually... When you started your fling with Sunga, you didn't say a word about it. Not a single word. No explanation. And I thought that was fine. But I'd rather do it like this. I'd rather tell you things like this. - To your face. - Thank you. I don't want you to have to find out through others. Good evening. - Good evening. - May I offer you a song? Go ahead, thank you. ♪ ["Castelhana" by Elton Saldanha] ♪ Today I'm off to the border Because I'll see my baby Whether I like it or not I've been waiting for The whole week To see my Castelhana My dearest flower South of my heart I want to have a good time Only you can provide South of my heart I want to have a good time Only you can provide Leave it all behind And come with me Let's see danger in the face Leave it all behind And come with me Let's see danger in the face Castelhana, if you do love me Do love me Just say so Castelhana, if you do love me We can be happy together [samba music] I'd stay here.

At first it was us three. Then two more boys showed up and two more girls. We were more. It was fun. We went to... - Tell me. - It was cool. We were in a kind of apartment, where... It was Cesar's friends place, but it wasn't his place, it was... like his grandma's but he was house sitting. And it was really cool because we slept on the floor, you could walk in full of sand because the house was made out of sand. Mom! Mom... Mom, can we talk? What's wrong? You scared me! It's just that my back is killing me from the bunk bed. I'm sorry. What time is it? It's almost nine. In three hours it's your birthday. Larissa and I broke up.
