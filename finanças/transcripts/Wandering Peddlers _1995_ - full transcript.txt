A Sony Corporation Production Worldwide Presentation by Shibata Organization Inc. A Film by Mitsuo Yanagimachi - Ever been to a big hotel, Mother? - Never. - If we ever get to Taipei... - The Grand's the best! - Taipei will be fun. - The Grand? I've been there. - I haven't. - At Donggang, it's karaoke. - I've been there. - I haven't. Let's go to Donggang next. - You've been there? - Yes, of course. - I've been there. - Well, I haven't. - Yes, you have! - You have, A-Hong! New Prestige Company In Taiwan, I met a group of people with an amazing vitality. Called Pao-Jiang-Hu, they were medicine peddlers. Wherever I went in Taiwan, I saw their energetic presence. Pao-Jiang-Hu, incidentally, means 'a moving society'.

When I was little - I was nine years old then, I was beset by misfortune. I was nine when... my mother passed away. I was performing the Eight Generals dance, when the gods invited me and I became a shaman. A shaman's job is to serve the gods... and to cure the sick. I've devoted my life to the salvation of mankind. You practice like this first. And after that, you use two. Like this. What's important is hand movements. When, after a lot of practice, you get skillful/good, then, you use three. You start out by doing it slowly. When you've mastered that, you move on to using all three. One, two... one, two... Attention, folks! Now it's time to enjoy... the beautiful matron's song! QIU Tu-ban, YE's wife I met my husband Ye... when I was in the singing and dancing troupe. I'd run away from home, and was working to make ends meet. I drifted from place to place, and ended up joining... the singing and dancing troupe. My real parents gave me away to strangers when I was five. I went back to my real parents at 16. By 17 I was working in a factory, and at 19 I had a boyfriend. I was married when I was 20, and had a child. Living with my husband's parents, both my father-in-law and mother-in-law... treated me very badly. I couldn't stay there anymore, so I ran away. That's when I met Ye. He had two children with him. One was three and one was two years old. "Where's their mother?" I asked him. "She ran away." That was the answer. As I looked after them, I became attracted to Ye. At that time, he was working as a musician. Midheaven is a place... ruled by Emperor Yuhuang. He administers for the deities... who reside in Midheaven. For example, Wufu, Chiansui, Xuantian Shangdi, and Tianshang Shengmu all reside in Midheaven. Beside them, is Jinmu Niangniang, who is the Emperor's mother. Not the real mother. She got the title of Mother. My stepmother was a singer in a cabaret before she got married. She could have married someone rich. My dad's poor, and short. A-HONG, YE's son My dad's poor, and short. A-HONG, YE's son A-HONG, YE's son He also had us kids, but she married him anyway. He also had us kids, but she married him anyway. I feel grateful for that. Whenever my father was performing, my sister and I were kept backstage, a rope tied around our waists, attached to a pillar like that. We'd piss and shit as we were. Appalled, our step-mother... took us under her care. Look at her white, shining skin! Have a good look! She's young! And she's sexy! Show them! Well? What do you want to eat? A-HONG and his girlfriend A-LIAN You shit! Don't make me swear. How long have you been living together here now? Six months and four days... No, six months and seven days. Since the day we moved in together? Six months and seven days. - Six months and five days. - You've been keeping track? - Please show me that. - What is that? Today's the tenth... I mark the dates. - So I can keep track. - Of your menstruation! - Keep your mouth shut! - But you do! Stop lying, or I'll cut your dick off! When did you start calling Mr Ye your step-father? Three days after I picked her up and brought her here. He's lying. His father wanted me to call him that. I don't mind, anyway. We might get married, after all. And I don't mind if we don't, either. We can't tell the future. No one can. He was fine when he was little, but he's become distant lately. I can't tell what he's thinking. I wonder what's going on inside his head. A-Hong quit school when he was in third grade. There were various reasons for that, but, ultimately, he didn't like studying. There were other reasons, too... but I can't explain them to you in a few words. I'd like A-Hong and my son A-Fa to take over our business. They don't have much of an education, and although it's a small business, they can be their own bosses. It's better than working for someone. Tomorrow's weather? - Not bad. - Wu seems to be opposed to... President Li's re-election. - What do you think of that? - Who told you? I read it in the papers. - Who do you prefer? - Neither. If I'm lying, may I get run over by a car and die! I only sell this medicine. This cures everything. Let me make enough to buy my girls some soft drinks. For six people only! It's only 300 yuan! I'm the only one in Taiwan selling this! It'll stay fresh for 8-10 years. From a baby to a 100-year-old. Eczema, keratose, psoriasis, pityriasis... it'll cure all skin diseases. If there's anyone else selling this in Taiwan, bring him to me. I'll give you 100,000 yuan! Selling 3,000 yuan's worth doesn't give us a profit. Food, gasoline, pocket money... and there's nothing left. Your sales yesterday? 3,600 yuan. How is it divided up? 500 yuan each to A-Hong and A-Lian. 500 to our help, and 300 went on gasoline. Not much left. This is all we have left! Take one each, all of you! It's only 200 yuan. It feels great on your skin! It's a steal! Only 200 yuan! Same for the small ones. Which one do you want? We paid 180 yuan for four box lunches today. 300 yuan for gasoline. And we bought drinks. All basic necessities. Subtract the 300 yuan we paid for the space, and that leaves us with 1500 yuan. That's all. Looks like it's going to rain. My father taught me tricks like walking on glass, and swallowing a light bulb. Or swallowing a chain... with decorations tied to it, and then pulling it out. He didn't teach me the fire-blowing trick, though. I quit when I was four. I quit because I disappointed my father. When all we had were two wrinkled 10-yuan bills, I happened to... I stole one of them. My father was enraged, and made me quit performing. I haven't seen Dad for a year. I can't go back now. My grandparents say it's okay, but I haven't the courage to. My father's really scary, I was terrified of him since I was little. I'm an adult now, but the feeling hasn't changed. He still scares me. What's his occupation? He's a cop. Please try it. It's good for 8, 10 years. When I was in sixth grade, Granny brought me lunch to school. She made dumplings, and put them in my lunch box. She walked all the way to school. It was about a 10-minute walk from home to school. She walked up to me... and I burst into tears the moment I saw her. "Where's my mother?" I cried. My mother wasn't my real mother. Your love for me will never grow cold I don't want you to be all alone I want to stay close to you But I'm faraway now, thinking of you Whenever I see the moon I miss you How did your real mother die? Suicide. Suicide? I don't want to talk about it. If you drink too much tea, you'll get sick. WU Tian-luo, 65 If you drink too much tea, you'll get sick. If you drink too much tea, you'll get sick. If you get into the habit... of drinking too much every day, you'll start getting jittery without it. Have a sip. The aroma's gone, but it's good tea. There's a comic routine between a young master... - and his servant. - How does it go? They both love to fight, so they go into town, looking for it. "What's going on over there?" "There's someone under the car! The car moves and he's dead!" "I got him out of there, and he slapped me! "Look at this, master! "There's a black hand print on my face!" "I don't blame him. He was fixing his car." "Fixing his car. I had no idea! "I'm not very smart, am I? "I've certainly learnt a lesson. I'm a lot smarter now! "So what would you like me to do next, buster?" "Buster?" "No! I said master. You must be hearing things!" They're Japanese. They heard about me somewhere, and have come to interview me. At 33, I formed my troupe. We traveled around for a while, but we disbanded in the end. I realised I liked performing alone better. In the old days, at a certain time, people used to gather in front of stores... to watch a TV program broadcast in Taiwanese. I'd be nearby, waiting with my lights off. When the program ended and people got up to go, I'd put on my lights and start singing, playing my moon guitar. When people came over to listen, that was the time to sell my medicine! Do you still play your moon guitar? Yes, I do. Would you like to hear it? I'll go get it. Since my husband died I eke out a living by needlework I live alone with my only son Another day has passed without much incident Grow up strong, my boy There isn't a grain of rice left We haven't eaten anything since last night I light my incense day and night and pray to my ancestors "Please look after us and bring in customers" We haven't eaten anything since last night They're making rice cake next door Sleep well, my son I'll find some potatoes and boil them for you Where did the Pao-Jiang-hu perform... in the old days? In rural areas. In front of tea houses, and places where people gathered. First, I'd have the customers listen to my song. If they started asking for encores, then I'd start selling! Did you go on tours? No, I was alone, moving around on my bicycle, so I'd only go to nearby villages. I didn't have to go far. I could make a living just in the neighbourhood. A performance each in the village entrance and exit, in the center of the village, and, if there was a factory, at its front gate. Four places in just one village. Listen to the tale of Old Taiwan It's not fiction, it's a true tale This medicine works wonders on anemia. It gives you vitality. It contains synthesized hormones, vitamins B1 and B2, cures muscle pains, weak constitutions, and fatigue, and it's great for people with weak hearts. When my father died, my mother was 28, with four children. Two boys, two girls, and I was the oldest at 10. We were poor, and we often due up potatoes to eat. But I was a good singer ever since I was little, and people would give me pocket money to hear me sing. I've always said this to people, that the ability to sing is a great gift. There wasn't much entertainment back in those days. I'd make one cent, two cents, and I was thrilled. People who were generous would give me 10 cents. Being poor, earning pocket money was like a dream. This... is the box I used to take on my rounds in the old days, stuffed with intestinal worm remedy. They came in a packet three centimetres thick, and four centimetres long. I'd put 100 packets in here, and would sell them all in a day. I'd put the box in front of me, and start singing when people gathered around. February in the old calendar is the time to sow By March, the rice will grow tall It's time to go out to the fields to reap what we sowed Come summer, the days grow longer It gets so busy we'll be running around the fields Rise early, have breakfast and off to work we go When it's June it gets boiling hot but we can't goof off and blame the heat No work, no pay June's the hardest month of all Now you're teaching classical performing arts, what's your life like now? Not bad. How do you feel when you look back at the past? Life was hard then. I hit the road, traveled from place to place, faced inconveniences, feared for my safety, and encountered many difficulties. But people too often look back... and moan about the past. It's over. I'm old now, but I'm teaching performance to a theatrical group. The group's doing well, and I'm content. There's an old saying: "The moon begins to wane after the full moon, "but a man's heart gets bigger after middle age." The past should be forgiven and forgotten. My future is to teach my art to the young. Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and made America lose its temper America returned the favour by dropping the atomic bomb The power of this atomic bomb is something else! And they dropped two powerful ones on Japan I'd like a boy first, then a girl. What're you doing?! - Let's go home and screw. - No! HUANG Zong-bin, master of ceremonies Please gather around quickly! It's a great show! Come quickly! Look! Doesn't she look fresh... and delicious? Can A-Hong make it as a master of ceremonies? To answer you frankly, no. He's got a long way to go. Why? Frankly, he doesn't have what it takes. He just doesn't fulfill the necessary requirements. Firstly, he's short. Secondly, he's a lousy dresser. Thirdly, he's too young. For him to become a proper master of ceremonies, it will take him another three to five years. When do you think you can become independent? Can he? I think pretty soon. By the end of the month. - That's two weeks from now. - But Mr Huang... Forget about other people. This is your life! Okay, okay. Don't be spoiled. Listen, don't "okay" me! - Don't "okay" me! - Drop it! What do you mean, "drop dead"? A-Hong can do it. He's memorized all the lines, so it's up to him. The line broke. I intend to hand the troupe over to him one day. He's not good for anything else, anyway. Sometimes a woman leaves her man while he's in the army, but that can't be helped. If two people really love each other, they won't split up so easily. What will you do when A-Hong goes into the army? I want to go to Taipei to study. But I can't tell him that. He's feeling insecure. I'm also very concerned about his family's well-being. So I need to think about a lot of things. But if it's possible, I'd like to study design... or technical art. If I go into the army, A-Lian will wait for me. She's not the kind of girl who would run away. When A-Hong returns from service, their relationship will change. Love is not a simple matter. They both have complex family backgrounds. No one can tell the future, but I don't think they'll last after he goes into the army. He's so wishy-washy. I don't know what he's up to. You cut your hair? - Do I look cool? - Yeah, very cool. - Sarcasm? - Don't start! You're always so hostile. So let's drop it. Or maybe not. - Do you want to fight? - No. You look cool. - Yeah? - Very cool. - Right. - A real ladies' man. - Exactly. Do you remember what you told me yesterday? You forgot? What did I say? "I adore you... "You're the most wonderful girl in the whole world, my love!" He really said that. He'll be all right. If my father ever catches me smoking, he'll hit the ceiling for sure. It's a dance show, folks! Look at her! What a body! Go on, dance! Get into it! What I have here, folks, is a magical towel! If you spill a drink... on your carpet accidentally, or if you ladies forget to close the window, and rainwater gets in, try wiping it dry with tissue paper. You'll use up a whole box! The still-wet carpet will get moldy... and eventually rot. So try this towel. You just leave it like this, or you can press it like this. You just use your hands or feet. "Spilt water can't be gathered"? Let's see how much water it's gathered. Squeeze it and you'll see. Worth one glass exactly. This one towel will absorb all the spilt water. And one more thing: When you wash your hair, wrap the towel around like this. You just need to press it lightly. What takes a dryer 30 minutes, this towel will do in seconds. A little rub here and a little rub there. Tea spilled by a lady, a baby wetting the bed... - Garlic? - Crush all of it. Chop everything else up. Ginger, too. Business is bad lately. I'm not enjoying it. - This? - Chop it up. The best thing to do in this business, is not to think too deeply. Relate to people kindly, and be liked by everyone. Look after our children properly... and not have people talk badly of us. It hurts when people speak badly of our children. - A-Fa talks back to me. - It's our fault. - The others aren't like that. - It's our fault. A-Hong's an adult now. He'll join the army soon. A-Fa's a big boy too. Don't expect our kids to do anything for us. Take it as it comes, I suppose. Mr and Mrs Ye have a big fight every five days, and they quarrel every three days. It's the wife's fault. She's always looking for Mr Ye's shortcomings. And that makes Mr Ye get on the booze. And then that affects his work. All of that... can't be good for A-Hong. The chain is heated red-hot. Red hot! If this doesn't give you a burn, we don't need hospitals. You'll burn yourself! I'll do it. Give me a hand. There are many medicine peddlers here in Taiwan. We have to tell people... that our medicine is unique. We also have to change... our products constantly. You try a product out, you can tell if it'll sell or not. But Mr Ye, he only thinks about lowering the price. Some things don't sell, no matter how cheap they are. But he's so stubborn, he never listens to my advice. To hell with him! Can you tell us why... Mr Huang left the team? I'd rather not. He left for various reasons. It's a private matter. His quitting doesn't affect us. Life is perseverance. My daughter was maltreated, and she fell ill. It was too late by the time I found out. She died in the hospital. All I can do is sigh. It's so sad... to see people with their daughters, and to know that mine's dead. All I do is sigh. It's been two years now. What can I do... but sigh... Fishing develops one's patience. We have to persevere. As we do in our line of work. It's important to be patient. When my step-daughter was 12 or 13, we sent her... to the proprietress of a theatre troupe. One day, my step-daughter called me up... but I didn't go to the phone. She must have wanted to tell me something, but I let her know that... I didn't want to talk to her. Some time later, perhaps a year later, we heard rumors that she'd had a child. She didn't get along with my wife, and fell for the wrong guy. They told me she fell off the stage and became ill. Who'd believe that? When she died, her mouth was badly swollen. They made her drink hydrochloric acid so she wouldn't talk. The inside of her mouth... was badly torn and swollen. Swollen to a pulp! How could they... She told me this... before she died... she told the proprietress about her pregnancy, but the latter wanted the matter concealed. My daughter had the baby. The child must be three or four by now. What happened was... I'm sure about this... the proprietress was in love with the same guy. That's why she maltreated my daughter. She was jealous. That's how it was. Do you know who the man was? I've an idea. He was a member of the troupe, the proprietress' husband. No wonder she was jealous. She abused my daughter to death. Let me introduce Master Zhanh, the world's snake king! Please welcome him with a big round of applause! ZHANH Cai-Ming, nickname: A-Ming Professor Zeng here is my teacher and my benefactor. People in developed nations fancy snakes. Take Japan, which is 30 years ahead of Taiwan. The Japanese come to Taiwan and eat poisonous snakes. "Taiwan's snakes give us a hard-on," they say. They know the snake's powers. This one's venomous. It's a king cobra, or rice spoon snake. Don't you mistake it for a rice scoop, though! Stand back. Let me bow again. It spat at me! I shall bow again! Hold its tail, my man. Watch this! Professor Zeng's house In China, the Pao-Jiang-Hu has a long history. The first Emperor of Sung, Zhao Kuangyin, was a great doctor. He, however, treated the sick but didn't sell medicine. His skills were passed down through various dynasties, until Hong Xiuquan of the Qing dynasty... formed the Heaven and Earth Society. Its goal was to rebel against the Qing.. and to restore the Ming dynasty. Even Sun Wen used the power of the Society. He used its propaganda machine to rebel against the Qing. He traveled to Taiwan and met Zhang Chiniu, who, with the collaboration of Wu Datiao, spread the Pao-Jiang-Hu in Taiwan. It was passed on from people to people, all members of the Shaolin Temple, 'kung-fu' fighters. They peddled medicine and cured the sick. They wouldn't accept payment from the poor. They didn't have microphones or musical instruments back then. They studied Chinese martial art from an early age, demonstrated their skills, and sold medicine. They didn't use music back then. They used gongs to attract people. Like this one. I've been using this one since I was 17. That's how we'd attract people in the good old days... "You went without a bath yesterday? "Then I'll pick your fleas," said the angel We're all together, always together When we're together, we're very happy You're full of smiles, and I'm full of smiles When we're together, we're very happy Two tigers, two tigers running very fast One tiger's ear is bitten and one tiger's tail is bitten - A man's underpants! - They're new! Put them on. They're new. Here's another pair. Who's next? A pair per person. Stop it! A toothbrush. A razor. The Americans told us, "Don't kill snakes!" They threatened economic sanctions if we did. That's why we protect snakes here. But the Chinese are far superior to the Americans. If your skin doesn't take well to expensive foreign cosmetics, just have some snake soup. Snakes make your skin beautiful. They give you men vitality, too! Look how much venom came out, even without biting! Look at the curved fangs! Have a good look, folks! My hand will turn black with the venom. Have a good look. The venom's lethal! It's swelling. It's black already. Look, it's swollen! Have a good look! So much venom's coming out! Look at it! This one's a cobra. This one's a king cobra. His poison's deadly. King cobras live in the mountains. Cobras live in the plains. They're venomous. I've been playing with snakes ever since I was a child. This is the venom. He's full of venom. It's extraordinary. This one's ferocious as well. Tell us about the history of snake charmers. Hold on. I'll put them away first, just to be safe. They're very dangerous. Let me tie the end of the bags. Western medicine uses serum injection, right? I've been injured so often, I had to have my finger cut off. I have the finger soaked in alcohol, but it's rotten now. I have so much toxin inside me now, my wounds don't fester anymore. This area is dark as a result of training. I can't straighten or stretch this finger. The tendon inside has hardened. My forefinger is useless now. Look, the color’s different. The poisonous one bit me here. I was bitten by another kind of snake here. All around here, too. It bit me here, too. A rattlesnake got inside my clothes and bit me three times. When you get bitten, the venom rushes through your body. You start aching everywhere. Here, there, and in the back. The venom gets in the blood and rushes through your body. Is your hand rotten? Most of my fingers are. It's so hot, I'm sweating. Summer's very tiring. But in winter, we just can't win. The cold keeps customers away. I'll retire when I'm 60. Medicine peddlers need to raise their voices. That taxes the energy. In the old days, people used to say: "Medicine peddling is hard." A quick mind, power of observation, guts. You need all three. The words Jiang-Hu... Jiang means eyes... and Hu means That's Jiang-Hu. Eyes and guts. For just 100 yuan, you can cure diabetes! A great American snake expert once said this: "Snake venom is precious, "more precious than gold or diamonds, "because if you drink it you'll never get cancer." Impure blood, numb fingers, numb feet, high cholesterol? Drink snake venom tonight, and you'll be cured tomorrow! It eliminates excess fat from the blood. Look inside its mouth! What long fangs! Look, it's beginning to swell. It's swelling! Without the snakes? What would've happened to A-Ming without his precious snakes? Let's see... He'd have gone mad. Or he might have become a monk. He loves snakes. - Adores them. - He'd be a monk. A snake is a cold-blooded animal. Cold-blooded animals... only think about survival. They eat, and they grow... that's all they do. They don't think. But they know where to find their prey. A snake has his territory. If he sees another snake... hunting in his territory, he'll attack the intruder. If he loses, he'll give up his territory. He'll always stay a bachelor. He just lives from day to day. No desires, no possessions. He only lives for the day. He's a monk, after all! A hermit. Your change. - How are the sleeves? - Too long. A perfect fit! A bit expensive. It's good quality, sir. Stop it! We've tried out just about everywhere. Gone back to the same place within a week sometimes. Imagine the same people buying our medicine each week. They can open up their own medicine shop! That's why our sales have gone down lately. We're planning to go to Gaoxiong next. We haven't been there for a year. Our customers there... should be running out of the medicine by now. The weather's good there. Here in Jiayi, it gets cold in October. How have your sales been? Not good at all. We used to sell... 30 to 40 thousand yuan's worth regularly. In one week. - In one month! - No, in a week. Now it's less than 5,000 a week. Sometimes a few hundred. Some days we don't sell anything. We're going to Gaoxiong for our livelihood. You'll leave the house as it is? We'll just close the shutters. So we can come back if anything happens. We don't know when we'll return, but if it rains for days, or a typhoon comes, we'll come back. A-Lian's family home is near Gaoxiong, isn't it? Well? I'd like to go back. There are many places to have fun there. - Good for our business. - Have barbecues! Catch fish and shrimp in the river and eat them by the riverbed. The shrimps are small there, but they're transparent, and you can eat them raw. Your parents must be worried about the business now. We're all worried. I pray for your continued success, ladies and gentlemen. We'll have gambling on Tuesday and Thursday. A chance for you to bet and make a lot of money! What are you doing? Memorize your lines! We're going to Gaoxiong, because our sales are down. I hope we'll do well there. "Our second stage is starting now!" The singing and the dancing start... "The show that's starting now..." I say "starting now" twice? - An insect stung me. - A mosquito? - No, a centipede! - Impossible! It's true! It doesn't matter. Continue practicing. We'll spend a year going around Taiwan. Taipei, Jilong, Gaoxiong, Taizhong, Hualian, and so on. Will this be a first trip for you, A-Lian? - Isn't it? - I've traveled before. You've traveled with guys before? Yes. - It's the truth. - Go to hell. You don't have to sulk. Been to Taipei and Taizhong? Mine doesn't have bean sprouts in it. Shall we go to Chishan? We could, but it's in the mountains. We can't go there! My father's there! He's in Jioxian, isn't he? Which is very close to Chishan. I don't want to go there! I'll be in the room. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for spending your precious time... in coming to see us, The New Prestige Company. We are a troupe... that's come all the way from Jiayi. I hope you'll enjoy our show tonight, and have a wonderful time. As a representative of the troupe, I pray for your prosperity, ladies and gentlemen. We'll have gambling on Tuesday and Thursday. We hope that you'll join us then, too. Without further ado, let me introduce our star: A super-beauty at the tender age of 17, possessing the most wonderful proportions, and the sweetest smile, here's Miss Candy. She'll sing The Moon Reminds Me of My Love. Please greet her with a big round of applause! Those who aren't seated yet, please hurry! The show's just about to start! I love you more than anything in the world Your love for me will never grow cold I don't want you to be all alone I want to stay close to you But I'm faraway now, thinking of you Whenever I see the moon I miss you Those of you who are passing by, please come on over! Don't miss it! It's the most wonderful show! The show's just started! I don't mean to make you wait But there's a reason why I can't go and see you I convey my feelings to the moon and think of you Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed the song. We'll now entertain you with her dancing. Come on over, folks! The dance is about to start! There you go! I can almost see her undies! I'm enjoying my work. I feel high. I'd like to continue doing it. I'd like to decide what to sell. I can get the stock myself. I have the knack for it. You do? Are you sure? What's the sales like since you've been in Gaoxiong? - Good. 78,000 yuan. - It's not good. It's not bad, either. But the food's expensive here. Are you buying one, sir? You're buying one, aren't you? It's better than winning a lottery! 500 a piece, limited to 12 people! Works wonders on scratches, cuts and burns! One for you, sir! Better hurry up, or it'll be sold out! One for that person over there! How do you feel, being here? Not happy. I'm not happy. I'm not! - Why not? - I'm scared. Of what? Of what? There you go! Because it's close to home. Let's have a dozen kids. That many? You'll have to look after them, you know. What if they're all girls? When there are 10 of them, they'll join our troupe. When they grow up, I'll marry them off to nice guys. Marriage is best for girls. If it's a boy, I'll make him take over the business. If he doesn't like the business and prefers studying, I'll send him to school. I'll respect his decision. You're being a sexist! Are you saying you won't respect a girl's decision? You said you believed in sexual equality! What a laugh!
