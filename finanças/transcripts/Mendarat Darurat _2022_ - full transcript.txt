Your lives are in our hands! Your honor is in our hands! Understood? Answer me! Why don't you answer me, geez! Answer me! Idiots! Pasteur, Citeureup, Purbaleunyi! Miss! How much? Initiation Bandung Institute of Technology Did you think you're higher than us? Higher than your honor? I found an idiot! I found another idiot! You're all at our mercy. What's with the toilet paper? - I have a cold. - What? - Cold. - Gold? - Cold! - Oh, cold. Who gave you the roll? - A senior gave me. - What? A senior gave me! A senior gave you? How did you get it? I'm still adjusting to Bandung's climate. - What? - I'm still adjusting to Bandung's climate. You're still adjusting to Bandung's climate? Are you from Jakarta? Yes. What's your name? - Glenn. - Gladd? It's Glenn! Ok, Glenn. I'm Maya, by the way. Found one idiot here! I'll have one soto mie. No spring onion, please. - Whatever she ordered, put it on my bill. - Everything? - You shouldn't have. - It's okay. It's my birthday today. Your birthday? Everybody, lunch is on Glenn! Goodness! - It needs to be enforced. - How about you? No, I'm good. What time is the usual? I asked you what time, and your answer is "the usual". Do you want to talk or not? I do want to talk. It's just a matter of... When somebody asks you "what time", you answer with the time. Are you angry at me? I'm not angry at all. - Everything's cool. - Then why did you answer me with that? Are you having an affair? Don't lie to me. Nobody's having an affair. Okay, it was my bad. I'll do my best to be home at 9-ish. What do you mean? What if I got stuck in a traffic... ...and I couldn't be home at 9PM sharp. - You'd be mad at me again. - Again? Yes, Mom. How are you? Didn't you call me first? I was in the shower. I'm calling you to ask why did you call me. Is your wife giving you hell again? No problem, Mom. Everything's fine! She's sitting next to me, by the way. She can hear you too. You're on speaker. Say hi to her. Hi, Mom. Hi, Maya. Are you on the way to work? This is our routine every morning on weekdays. What else? I see. Take care. - Okay. Bye, Mom. - Bye... - By the way... - Yes, Mom? Take it easy on Glenn, ok, Maya? Bye, kids! Bye, Mom. How many times should I tell you to keep our problems between us. Why did you tell your mother? I talk with her everyday. Sometimes when I run out of things to talk about... ...I end up telling her about us. You're an adult, Glenn. You really don't have to share every detail of our lives with your mother. - What date's today? - Why? Do you keep my menstrual cycle? Do you think I'm mad at you because I'm having PMS? It not always from PMS, Glenn. Babe, if you're having PMS everyday of the month... ...when is the period? Give us some out of the box ideas. I want to win the contract on the day we do the presentation. My idea is the best out of the box idea that you've ever had. Heck, we're gonna smash the box if we had to. We don't have the budget, though. Then we smash the budget. You know our client's budget range, Yahya. If we keep pushing this idea, they're gonna scream. Then we smash the client. If we've covered that subject, I have some revisions... Sir, you can't put a price on brilliant ideas. If you want to pay less, then let's just steal our competitor's idea... - ...and make a little change here and there. - Then we smash the competitor. It's 6PM. Can we talk about revisions? The idea is okay, but we need to ephasize on the application. We have no choice. You gave us a short deadline. Then smash the time. Why am I in the meeting with these people? How about we pitch this idea to the client first? They might like it. We just need to be on the same page. We're colleagues, we should support each other, instead of smashing each other. Revision... - Well, Kania? - I like the idea. It's just... Well, let me try probing the possibility, I'll keep you posted. Great. Meeting's over. Thanks, guys. Why are you in our meeting? Aren't you suppose to make some revision before you go home? - I'm doing it, but you were... - No excuses. - I'm not giving you any excuses. It's just... - Are you talking back to me? - Of course not. I'm just explaining... - See? Everytime we gave them a good idea, we always stuck with the budget. - Why didn't you say something at the meeting? - I did. Just a few words. I don't like getting involved in a heated debate... ...and go back home to the same situation. Is Maya mad at you again? Then we smash Maya! Don't laugh. Why she's mad at you? Or maybe she got PMS? I asked her about that too. Hold this for me. She talked about date, so I asked her... ..."what date today?" She said, "Why are you asking about date?" "Do you think everytime I'm angry at you it's because I have PMS?" "PMS is not everyday." - Well... - She's correct. But when I come home late that doesn't mean I'm having an affair either. She always thinks I'm cheating on her. It's just your luck. Why are we taking a selfie? Glenn, Yahya. Come with me to my office. - Why? - Don't ask. It's urgent. How urgent can it be? Still in the meeting with Samsudin. - Here you go, Miss. - Thank you. Glenn is like a security guard. He's reporting on hourly basis. I see no problem in that. If you want your marriage to last forever... ...you should care about your husband's activities. I'm not talking about snooping, I'm talking about caring. But if you give your husband too much freedom, you'll end up like Josie. Some bitch stole her husband. Please, Narissa, stop talking about your ex husband. - It's not good for your health. - Not good for my ears either. That's one more reason for you to get married soon. You'd understand. No, thanks. Marriage is sacred. It's so sacred your husband is taking a second wife. Polygamy is better than keeping a mistress. I'd rather have a monogamous marriage, thank you very much. Are you sure you're gonna let your husband marry another woman? No. But our religion allows it. Does being single forever forbidden in our religion? I don't think so. How do you expect feminism to work if we can't be on the same page about polygamy. Let's start by agreeing that all men are jerks. Calm down, not all men are jerks. I know. Some of them are straight sons of bitches. Honey, I'm gonna have a business dinner with some clients tonight with these boys. I think I'm gonna be home late tonight. Can't you let them handle it? They're your senior staff, right? - Honey, without me... - Is the meeting real? ...they'd be lost. - Fine, I'm gonna leave you alone. - Alright. So no supper at home? Just making sure I don't need to serve you supper. No, I'm gonna eat dinner with the clients and these boys. - We'll leave any minute now. - Alright. - Okay. Bye, honey. - Take care, honey. Mr. Samsudin, I've got your dinner! Glenn, Yahya... ...I thought I told you that we'll have dinner in the restaurant. Why did you order food? See? They're lost without me. - Whatever. Bye, honey. Bye everybody. - Bye, Ma'am. - Did you order dinner? - No. Stop talking. I have a date with Linda. Which Linda? We have two Lindas. One in Accounting Department, and the other one is an intern. It's the one with tattoo on her waist. How should we know? You won't. Glenn... I heard what you said about your wife is accusing you of having an affair. But I know you're faithful to her. Let me tell you something. It doesn't matter if you are cheating or not. She'd still think you're cheating on her. In that case, you'd better have a real affair. At least you'd get to have fun. Right? Mr. Samsudin, we're still on for tonight? Of course. Can you hold on a minute? I need to brief them about a project before we go. Okay? That's Linda. But that's Lia. That's not Linda. Thank God you corrected me. I bought you martabak. It's on the dining table. Did you see it? Yes, I'll eat it after I wash myself and change my clothes. - How was the presentation? - Go change your clothes first. They're dirty, you're gonna make the bed dirty too. - I just want to say hi to... - I already showered. Go wash yourself and change your clothes. You've been outside all day. Never thought it would be this hard to have an intimate moment with your own wife. What did you say? Being intimate with you is so hard now. What do you mean? Are you threatening me with cheating? I didn't say that. You do realize... ...it's all in your head, right? I'm not having an affair. Ask everybody in the office. You know Yahya. Go ask him. I know you told him to cover for you. Like your pervert boss, Mr. Samsudin, told you to cover for him. I don't buy it. And I have cramps. First day of my period. You're crazy. What did you say? You're crazy! And deaf too. You kept saying "What did you say? What did you say?" I want to sleep alone tonight. Get out. Out! And you're late! You promised you'd be home by 8PM... ...and where did you go? Don't lie! Where did you go? - Hello, Sir. - If my wife call's... ...tell her the meeting finished at 1AM. By the way, I was wrong. Lia's tattoo is not on her waist. It's on her shoulder. Then who's got a tattoo on her waist? It doesn't matter if you are cheating or not. She'd still think you're cheating on her. In that case, you'd better have a real affair. At least you'd get to have fun. Right? Can you at least come to work on time? You know I should drop Maya at her office first. If that's your routine, leave home early. But how about the traffic? Your excuses are getting old. Traffic is unavoidable in Jakarta... You both look so energized this morning. How about I make you coffee? I'll tell Maya to be ready earlier, okay? I don't have time for this shit. I knew it, you don't have time. Even for brewing coffee. How about I make you a cup of coffee? You take your coffee black, right? Do you want... Great! If everybody's busy, I want to be in the game. - I want hot water. - That's it? - Yes. No, thanks. - How about cappuccino? - Who do you want to punch today? - You. You look like you're ready to punch someone. Did you hear what Kania said to me? What a bitch. Never changed. She's pretty but she can be so bitchy. No wonder nobody wants to date her. I'm single and I'm not a bitch. But you're not pretty either. - But I don't stutter. - You're an idiot. And you talk just fine when you're cursing. I think you're lucky to be single. Being single is fun. You don't have anybody yelling at you when you come home early or late. - How about if you don't come home at all? - Especially that. She's crazy, man. I've never cheated on her... ...but she thinks I am. So why shouldn't I make her wish come true? I thought I heard Samsudin say that. Don't take advise from him about relationship. Listen, I'm the only reason our marriage is still intact. I could just go and leave everything behind. But I stay. But I don't know how long I can take it. I need some intimacy. I can help you with that. - Moron. - See, no stutter. You still have time to chit-chat after you come late to the office? Where's the deck plan? We're discussing that. See? We're discussing work. Did you see that? Pretty and bitchy. - You like her, don't you? - No, I don't. You said she's pretty two times in just under 15 minutes. She's beautiful... ...but she's also a bitch. Glenn, you know people talk like you when they have a crush with someone. Just like boys in elementary school. Did you go to elementary school at all? Or you got your stutter from skipping elementary school? I can't turn on my Mac. What are you doing here? Making coffee. Well, that's new. I thought you always have Dani to make your coffee. No. I sometimes come here... ...to make myself a cup of coffee. - What are you doing? - I'm looking for... ...the mug. Actually, I'm not looking for this mug. It's not mine. But nevermind. This will do. I think Dani misplaced my mug. You have a personal mug? Of course. Dani. Yes, Miss Kania? Where did you put Glenn's mug? He doesn't have a personal mug. I always serve his coffee in an office mug. I know every personal items in this pantry belong to whom. I have a mug. You just forget. - Why don't you check your notes. - No, I never forget. Check again. I know it's in there somewhere. I know he forgets about my mug. He's forgetful. It's hot. Back to work. I found my mug. But that's my mug. Let's eat. I warmed up last night's martabak. How long have we been married? I never eat at this hour. Especially not martabak. I come home tired, and you pick a fight over some petty stuff. Stupid. Looking for something? A mug. Thanks. What, no more acting like you did yesterday? I wasn't acting at all. Are you sure? Where do you live? Rawamangun. Why are you asking? No reason. I just thought I've never seen a man pick you up after work. I know you don't drive a car to work. Do you have any boyfriend? Why do you want to know? Can I have some water? Sure. Thank you. Stop. I mean... ...no personal reason. But I think you're a pretty girl. I don't understand if you don't have any boyfriend. Why are you laughing? You're acting like a high school boy. I like someone. But he's already taken. Hey, Kania. What's your friend's name? - Which one? - The one with the fair skin. I have many friends with fair skin. She looks like the actress from Ayat-Ayat Cinta. - The first movie or the sequel? - Which one has Raisa in it? Is Raisa in the movie? Do you know from which movie? We're not discussing about movies! But I don't know who's the person you're talking about. Come with me. Her body is... Glenn, can you take it easy with Kania? People in the office are starting to notice. If you want to have an affair with her, find a secluded place... ...so you won't feed them with gossip. But where? If we're dating in public... ...and people saw us together... ...and if one of them knew us, we'd be fucked up too. That's not my problem. You could get a room or anything. I'll see you tomorrow. Wait! When you say I should get a room, do you mean for chatting or... In Padang Restaurant with the boys, near the office. Share-loc, please. My staff are weird. If you see me, or him, or him busy working, but I've never even seen you... ...open your mouth in any meeting. - Do you know who helped him all this time? - Who? I work alone. So bad. Come to the pantry. I'm there already. There's no use. How old are you? Heck, I'm young... Kania, we should be careful about flirting at work. People are starting to notice. - How old are you?- What's your idea? Let's find a secluded place far away from everybody. - Why archaeologist? - Why not? Where? We can't risk people find out about us in public. - Me? Looking for fossils? - You'll fit in. And you're looking for trouble. Looking for trouble? But I'm doing okay with you. How about we book a room? It's safe there. That's why you have to be born handsome, just like me. Everything's easy. How about we book a room? It's safe there. Check in to a hotel? Are you sure? We're just gonna chat, right? Where? We can't risk people find out about us in public. How about we book a room? It's safe there. We're just gonna chat, right? Okay... Thank God! I mean, thank God... ...we can hang out and eat with friends. Life is about being grateful. Right? You're right. He's right. Thank God! Let's say it loud and pound the table! Thank God! Being grateful is the correct practice. I agree with you. Yahya... Sorry, it's not that I'm not grateful. But that Panji Asmoro Bangun mask artist is so old... ...when I e-mailed the requirements, he asked me to explain it by phone. Even after I explained it by phone, he didn't seem to get it either. I think his son run his e-mails. If you have problem making it clear to him, then why don't you fly to Malang and meet him in person? Malang? I don't think so. You are paid to do that. Where's your passion? Take it as licking Samsudin's boots. Can you pick someone else? I have plans too. - Do you have any idea who? - Me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. This is like a paid vacation to me. It's a chance to get out of the house. Especially when you're constantly yelled at. - Okay. But you're 100 percent sure? - Yeah. Okay, then it's fixed, he's going. You're saved by the bell this time. You should thank God. - Thank God! - Not that loud, idiot! People are watching. Where did you say you're going? I know you told me yesterday, but I forgot. Malang. I'm meeting with a wooden mask sculptor in Pakisaji. We need to find Panji Asmoro Bangun mask... ...for our client's new campaign. It's a half day meeting though. I'll be home around 8PM. I mean I'll be home at 8PM sharp. Glenn. Don't forget to send me the picture of your boarding pass. That's my boarding pass. I'll be on Pusaka Air. Flight PP 1806. Everything's good then. But I have another meeting today, so I think we can't meet in person. I hope that's okay with you. Okay, thank you. I'm on the plane, I have to turn off my phone. Hi. Come in, Kania. I... What? What did you want to say? Can I use the toilet? - Sure. - Okay. Glenn? - Yeah? - Are you talking to me? No. I'm talking to myself. Good afternoon. Back again with me Stany Agustaf... ...on your busy day bringing you the latest news. We quoted Kapolri General Idris Suryadi that in January to August... ...there have been 29.615 drug cases from all over the country. Explaining it to Commission 2, Idris said they have secured evidence... ...such as meth, cannabis, ecstacy, heroin and cocaine. There was mass hysteria reported in one of vocational school in Jakarta. It started when one of 11th grader had to stay in school late at night. Breaking news today is an obituary. An airplane just crashed. A local commercial airline company with flight number PP1806... ...from Jakarta to Malang, just crashed. There's a concern that there are no survivors from that crash. Our field reporter already got... ...the flight manifest of the plane. We need at least two days to match... ...the list with the victims. We'll be back with more news after the break. Turn on your phone. Tell her that you were not on that plane... ...and say you didn't go because you had bad feeling about it. I can't. My last message for her was that I was on the plane... ...and I had to turn off my phone. I can't tell her another story in which I disembarked the plane, that's too ridiculous. I can't just ask the pilot to turn back the plane mid-air because of my bad feeling. - Then tell her the truth. - Are you nuts? Tell her that you lied to her about boarding the plane. Tell her that you're sick and tired of being yelled at all the time... ...you went to stay at Yahya's. I don't need to lie about it. At least tell her something. Or maybe you were in a massage parlour. At least something. I can't tell her I was in a massage parlour! She'd eat me alive! Well... I have an idea. I'm gonna confess to her. I can't. I can't. I can't confess that I lied to her. She'd be furious. I can't do that. I'm literally a prisoner without even lying to her. She also keeps warning me about lying. I never thought I could speak that fast. I don't know what am I gonna do. But we can't stay in this hotel room forever. We need to get out of here. But it's not safe outside. People will know that you're still alive. But how about my mom? Glenn. I have to go to Bandung. Yes! You can tell her by phone. Since nowadays cell phones can keep your contacs numbers, do you still memorize the numbers too? Just go to the lobby, I'll be right behind you. Go straight home. My head is pounding. Okay. I'll see you later? Okay. We're in front of Pusaka Air office building... ...to investigate more about the crash of the flight PP1806. We're waiting for any family member of the victim to come out from the building for an interview. I think we found one. Narissa? Excuse me. Do you have any family member on the ill-fated plane? No, I came here to support my best friend. Her husband was one of the passenger. How about your husband? Was he on the plane too? He is my ex, and no, unfortunately he wasn't on that plane. Apparently her husband is still alive and wasn't one of the passengers. We will wait again until someone else dies in there. Here she is. Her name is Maya. Come here. Excuse me, Miss Maya? Do you have any comment about the crash? - That's Maya, not me. - You're not Miss Maya? She looks more sad. Miss Maya, how do you feel when you found out... ...about your husband's tragic death? What a stupid question. What a stupid question! How would you feel if you find out that your wife was dead? I'm still single. Did you have a bad feeling? Was he behaving strange? - No! No! - Photo fell down from where it hanged? - Nightmares maybe? - No! How about you? Can you tell us about her late husband? His name was Glenn, they had been together since college. Glenn kinda had an innocent look. But apparently his vintage style was his identity. Goodness gracious! Glenn was a unique person. He was creative, a funny guy. He often gave us unusual gifts. On my wedding day, he gave me a pillow with "tonight" printed on one side... ...and the other side "not tonight." Have you ever peeked inside his bag? He puts stuff in there. Unusual stuff. I once opened his bag and found a pack of salt... ...Jakarta map, and fan from a wedding souvenir. He also always carried wet tissue I think. Toilet paper. He was a funny guy. Full of ideas in his head. He always tried to solve his problems. He was kind, too kind. He always lets me win in quarrels. Miss Maya, if he's watching you right now, what would you say to him? What a stupid question! Do you think they want to watch your show in heaven? Are you crazy? I'm a mourning widow, and you ask me one stupid question after another! Enough, Sir. What a moron. Please return to your room, Sir. I just want to take a nap. Why won't you let me? I paid you to sleep in this hotel. We know, but I already told you... ...you can't sleep on this sofa. This is public area. I always slept on the commuter train, they didn't bat an eye. And it was a moving train. And here I am, not going anywhere! But this sofa is for our guests to sit. Do you want people sitting in your room? You should ask them, not me! I just want to have a quick nap. But my wife locked me out from our room. If you want to talk to my wife, be my guest. What the hell! You just can't wait to make another scene, do you? Please take your husband upstairs, Ma'am. Shut up! We're tired from being detained for 22 hours by airport security... ...because this moron joked about bomb on our plane. Moron! - Yes, you're a moron. - Hey! Who are you calling a moron? You have loose lips. I was just joking. I wouldn't have a bomb on me. What? There's a bomb? Get down! Drive! Now! Hey, moron couple! You did that. - I just want to sleep peacefully! - I just want to work peacefully! Where to, Sir? - Bandung. - Bandung? Don't worry. I can pay. It's not that, Sir. But why don't you take a train or hire a travel agent? But at least can you take the road to Bandung? - But not to Bandung city. - To Bandung city. I can't, Sir. - No, just take the road to the city. - Which road? - The road to Bandung! - I can't! I took the night shift, and this is my last round... ...before I go back to the garage. I can't go to Bandung. Can you just take the free way? Okay, which one? If you say Bandung one more time, I swear to God, you'll walk from here. Cawang. - That I can. - We can drive to Bandung from Cawang, right? Yes, but not to the city. Okay, just take the free way. Alright. Glenn, you should sleep. I know this is a stressful situation. Why don't you close your eyes and take a deep breath. Alright? Okay... I have a feeling we're gonna be okay. So... - We're gonna be okay. - Yes. We're gonna be okay. Why don't you change it with your spare tire? This is my spare tire. I had a flat tire too last night, and I put on this spare tire. Then why did you park in a hotel? You should go back to your garage. This is inconvenient for us, stranded on a free way. It's scorching hot too. Say that again. Stay away from us. Don't move closer. Glenn... ...are you hungry? That's it for me. I'll have egg balado, fried chicken, and the fish too. I want vegetables stir fry, fried tofu and tempeh, with lots of sambal on the side. I'm hungry. I'm lucky we found this food stand instead. Imagine if we went to a restaurant. How can we pay for the food? With money, of course. You should go out with me more often, and you'd know I eat a lot. I would, if you weren't so bitchy to me. I apologize. That's the only way to cover my true... To cover your true what? - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. To cover your true what? Can I ask you something? Tell me about your marriage with Maya. I just want to be clear about our relationship. I want to know my place. What do you think of me. Am I just a get away for you or you just want to play around? Play around? No! Not at all. Let me put it this way. When we were together in the hotel room... ...what you had in mind? Elly! Yes, honey! Is that Dani? I can't pick you up later after work. Somebody from my office passed away. His name was Glenn, he was kind to me. I have to go to his funeral. You gave me the same excuse last week. And now again? Last week, he was not a very good person. But this man was a very good person. I have to go to the funeral with everybody from the office. I can't believe this. You always use dead people for your excuses. Your grandpa, your grandma, your mother. You're surrounded by dead people. How many of your family members would be around on our wedding day? - We don't know how long we live. - I do, I've been living for 20 years. I know you're cheating on me. You have another woman. You should see yourself in the mirror while you're ranting. One girlfriend is too much headache, can you imagine keeping two of them? I'm warning you. If you lie to me, you'll be the one in the coffin. And nobody's gonna come to your funeral. Your funeral would be like rich people's neighborhood, abandoned and empty. Why do you insist on going to his funeral? Do you know his wife? As a matter of fact, I do. Her name is Miss Maya. Stop ranting and listen to me. Mr. Glenn once asked me to send flowers to Miss Maya's office. She cried when she received the flowers. Their relationship was so sweet, just like ours. She didn't cry. She yelled at me non-stop. She said, "Why did you send them to my office? Just take them back. You could've brought them home instead." But I think bringing them home would be inconvenient for me. She also once asked me to bring Mr. Glenn's files that he left in the car... ...and just put them on his desk without telling him what happened. I was curious and asked her why. She said, "I want to surprise him. He'd thank me later at home." See, they were perfect couple. I want our marriage to be as perfect as theirs. We don't need to show it off to people. You really don't want to go home? It's not too late. She'd be angry at you, but in the end, she'd be happy that you're alive. I think I know that voice. What is it? Are you hungry? But you said you're going to a funeral. Don't they serve snacks in a funeral? They even give out lunch. I think I know that voice. What happen? - What's wrong? - It's just a cat. Sit down. I'm still hungry, I didn't get a chance to eat the food. Sorry... ...that I made you run like hell. I like hanging with you. You asked. That's my answer. I like hanging with you. Because I think it's so easy talking with you... ...and you don't respond it with snapping and yapping. That's it. You can do that with Yahya too. But he's not easy on the eyes. You're a bad person. You're dissing your own friend. Are we holding hands? Why don't you treat your girlfriend? That's the guy. - Go down that ladder. - I can't. Yes, you can. Are you sure it's them? Yes or no? - It's them! Get them! - Torch them! Sir, excuse me. We don't have money. You won't get anything if you mug us. We're pennyless. If you don't have any money, then why did you eat in my sister's stall? - The food stall we were just in! - That stall! We're so sorry, Sir. We didn't mean to dine and dash. But we were in a urgent situation that forced us to leave the site immediately. - What urgent situation? - It's a long story. But I have money. I can pay you. But I thought you said you don't have any money. I do! See? So you lied to me? No, we didn't lie to you. We didn't lie. But if you were muggers, we don't have this money. But since you said you are not muggers, the money returns! So are you saying just because I look ugly and dirty, then I must be a mugger? That's not what I said. But you were surrounding us. So I automatically thought you were muggers. So are you saying we were all muggers? You're too sensitive. Are you a Pisces? I'm not only here to get my money, but to also teach you a lesson. I want you to learn to not treat people like us like dirt. - Let's just get them. - Torch them! Shut up! I don't need anybody helping me. I will beat him up myself. Let's split. Sir, I'm not looking for trouble... We're just... Come on. Fight back, Glenn! Sir, why did you... He's getting up again. He's asking for more. Finish him! Don't touch her! Stop! Why do you keep asking for more? My mother said... ..."as long as you can still hit back... ...you should fight back". - Beat him up! - Torch him! Shut up! He said he's sorry. He paid his debt. Even if you think you're in the right... ...that doesn't mean you can do anything you want to your opponent. You're so wise. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm a Libra, by the way. So you're not a Pisces? Today, our field reporter managed to gather the list of passengers who died on the plane crash. Who is it? Don't freak out. He's not a ghost. It's Glenn. He's still alive. - He's not a ghost, calm down. - But you died on that plane. I wasn't on that plane. - He was with me when the plane crashed. - In a hotel. We checked-in. - What did you do to his face? - I didn't do anything to him. It's a long story, okay? Now, can I sit down? And do you have first aid kit? - Do you want tea? - Yes, please. So you came here to borrow my car... ...so you can go to Bandung... ...and meet your mother to tell her that you're still alive. Do you want your mom to have a heart attack just like I almost had? I really thought you were a ghost. I wanted to say prayer, but I only memorized these verses. I really need my mom's advice. I need guidence from her. Because I'm blank, I don't know what to do. You're nuts. You should tell the world that you're still alive! How long do you want to fake your death? Do you want to run away to another country... ...and alter your face with plastic surgery? Who do you think you are? Eddy Tansil? Who is he? And you said you're into vintage stuff. He's from Juventus team. Look, how long do you want to fake your death? Forever? You can't do that. But... - You have feelings for Kania? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Glenn, after you were gone, I just realized how much I love you. Forgive me, Glenn. I yelled at you a lot. It's been too long we kept this secret I don't think I can keep it any longer I just can't keep my eyes And my feelings from you Love began unintentionally Has grown to become such a beautiful story I wish... You were on my side for the rest of time I wish there were only the two of us I want to stop the hands of time If only for a while You have to be strong and let him go. But I won't see my only son ever again. Just let him go... ...or his soul won't rest in peace. You don't know that. People don't just die and go to heaven. Then where do they go? Haunting us? Sorry. It's just Vera always talking nonsense. In Islam, people don't go straight to heaven after they die. We have to wait until the end of time to be lifted to the sky. What are the doing in the sky? - Walking in orderly manner. - Why? To wait in a line. - For what? - Are you dumb or what? They still don't know if they would go to heaven or hell. There will be countless of dead spirits waiting for their fate to be decided. Some of them even died before Christ. Some of them died during occupation, from Padri War, and so on. - Where can we find them? - At the place they died. If they died in Cilacap, then they'd have to wait there. Same rule if they died in Tolo-toli, or in Bau-bau. What are you two talking about? Sorry, I'm just trying to explain to her. But she won't stop talking. - Sorry. - It's okay. Are you sure you don't want me take you to the nearest hotel where you can get rest? I'm fine. I can wait in the car. Just in case you need my help. Sorry. Thank you. Why don't you call him? - Call him and tell him how you feel about him. - Call who? Call Glenn's spirit. Call him and he will come to you. Just try it. Who knows, right? Yes, try calling him, we never know. You said there are things left unsaid. Think of it like you are confiding in him. Why are you talking nonsense? I'm mourning my only son. I need to sleep. I'm tired. It's okay. You need to rest. - Don't forget to call him. - Because who knows. How about we call him instead? You do that. I didn't know him that well. Me neither. When he was still alive, we didn't know him very well. And especially after he's dead. He's staring at you. How should we call him? Glenn... I want to see you again for the last time, Glenn. I want to hug you. - The skin on the back of my neck is crawling. - Not again. I think he's here. Are you saying he is haunting us? Or maybe he's haunting his favorite part of this house. His room. - Let's go to his room. - This place is dead quiet. I know. Don't worry. It's clear. Do you need to make that sound? We're looking for Glenn's spirit and he wasn't born as a poultry. Let's split. Glenn... ...it's Aunt Vera. Come to us. It's Aunt Mari, Glenn. How are you? I know as years went by, we drifted apart. Mom? Mom, forgive me, Mom. Forgive me, Mom. Show yourself! Now! Touch me, gently. I'm still alive. See? Hairy ghost. - I saw Glenn's ghost! - Are you sure? - A hundred percent! - Really? I saw Glenn's ghost behind that window when you said... I'm really still alive. I lied to Maya that I was on that plane. But actually I was in a hotel room, cheating with another woman. But, why did you need to make the plane crash? Why did I... I have nothing to do with the crash. But it really happened. But Maya said you were on the crashed plane. I lied to her. Forgive me, Mom. Glenn, are you outside? It's cold outside. Why don't you come in? I don't want you to catch cold. My life is a mess. I never thought it could be this mess up. And the worst thing is I don't know how to make it right. And I hate how Maya has been treating me. Then I met a woman who understands me so well... Why did you hit my head? I fainted multiple times, I couldn't stop crying. That's why I apologize to you for breaking your heart. I do. Let go of my book. Glenn, I thought you were dead. Oh, my God. You said you've been looking for the answer... ...but you don't seem to find it. Or maybe you've been asking the wrong question. Maybe the question is... ...not whether you should keep faking your death or not. But what are you going to do about your marriage? Glenn... If you still can't answer the question... ...with whoever you have a relationship... ...then you will always have that doubt whenever they put you in the same spot. Do you want to fake your death again? Thank you, Mom. Now go. Scram. Aunt Vera. Aunt Mari. Aunt Vera, wake up. - Aunt Vera... - Nyai Belorong!! Mari. Sorry, can you leave my room for a while? No problem. This is your room, anyway. - Thank you. - Sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Deliver us from evil! What's that? Do you remember that thing? "Yes, Ma'am." What's wrong? "I have a cold." Why? "Bandung is too cold for me." Aunt Vera, is my mom still in her room? I think so. Mom. That's more like it. Clean and handsome. I know what I'm going to do. Thank you, Mom. Bye, Aunt Vera. His ghost can drive a car? The car is a phantom car. Error. Goodness. Hey... Hey. Are you hungry? I stopped by a minimart and bought you water and a bread. Are you saying you went to a minimart in the middle of the day? Of course. How did it go with your mom? When she saw me she thought I was a ghost. Did she give you advise you've been looking for? Can you tell me about it? The big question is not about whether or not I should go on with faking my death... ...or come clean to her that I'm still alive. My mom said there's a bigger question... ...I should ask myself. It's about what am I going to do with our marriage. - Are we gonna return the car? - Yes. Can't hold it any longer. Come on in. Nobody's home anyway. How was the trip? He spoke with his mother. And what is he gonna do? I don't know. He hasn't told me anything about it. Kania, are you... For the longest time. But I kept it to myself. What if, this is hypothetical. What if he decided... ...to save his marriage? I'll support that decision. I will support whatever his decision. - Who is it? - It's Maya. What is she doing here? I don't know. Hang on. I'm not decently dressed. Glenn, quick! What? What are you doing? Just go upstairs! - What are we doing here? - Shut it. Maya's outside. Maya's outside? Can you be quiet? Maya's outside? Can you just shut up? Hi. What took you so long? Am I interrupting your lunch? Sorry. Finish your food. I'm not that hungry. You said you were not decently dressed. Did you eat your lunch bare naked? What do you expect when you're alone in your house? I can eat buck naked if I want to. Are these my things? Yup, I found them in my house. Whenever I look at them, they remind me of him. Why are you standing? Did I pick the wrong time to come here? No, not at all. It's just I've been sitting all day. You could have mailed them to me to save you from coming here in person. You can rest and spend your time at home. Doing nothing at home only makes me think about Glenn all the time. Glenn... Is she really crying for me? Do you want to go home? I can drive you home if you're too tired. And I can take taxi to go back here. I regret... ...the way I treated him by yelling at him all the time. I don't want to yell at him everyday. Can we talk about it on our way to your house? I know I didn't trust him. I kept asking him, where he's at whom is he with, asking to share location... ...and photos to prove he wasn't lying. I regret treating him like that. I know he didn't like it. I could tell by looking at him. Sometimes I asked myself why we were growing apart? But today I realized... ...that I was the one who pushed him away. And now he's gone. Don't you want to go downstairs, Glenn? This is the moment. It's all my fault. It's not your fault, Maya. No, it's not my fault. It's our fault. - If we didn't... - Stop, stop, stop. Can we talk about that in the car? If we didn't have an affair, I wouldn't keep him on a short leash. I knew from the start that the affair would bring bad luck. Although we ended the affair, but I still feel guilty. The guilt kept me in suspicion mode. Afraid he was gonna cheat on me. Karma. Glenn was so kind to me. He was so kind. I regret our affair. He trusted me. He never snooped on my phone, and he didn't deserve to be treated like that. And now he's gone... ...and the last memory he had about me was... ...that I didn't trust him. That's all I want to say. What we did is wrong. Glenn. Oh, shit. You. Glenn. It was you all along. - Listen to me, Glenn. - No. Listen to me, listen to me. Everyday! Everyday I felt like I'm a prisoner. I kept wondering what did I do wrong with my marriage. Every single fucking day! And it was all because of you. My own best friend. Why did it have to be you? There are billions of people in this world but it had to be you! - I know what I did was wrong. - Isn't that obvious? What did you do to her? - We didn't do anything, Glenn. - Liar! I bet you took her to a hotel. That's why you gave me the idea to take Kania to a hotel. And now my life is ruined... ...by your stupid idea! To check in to a hotel and fuck Kania! What did you say? No, I didn't mean... Look... I really didn't mean what I said. I'm really sorry. Glenn, you need to know that when I'm in love with somebody... ...in my mind he's perfect. I'd do anything for him. I adore him so much. I even supressed my ego and told him to save his marriage. Do you know why I did such things? Because I love him with every breath of my heart. I'd do anything just to see him happy. I was so in love with him... ...today I almost shout in happiness. I finally spent some time with him. We talked, we joked, and we even held hands. It crossed my stupid mind... ...that maybe he's feeling the same about me. Could it be? But it turns out he just want to... - Where are you going, Kania? - Home. I'm tired. Are you gonna walk home? I can give you a ride. I'm heartbroken, but I'm not a moron. Glenn! We ended our affair because of that thing. Everytime she saw that thing, her mood changed. I know what I did to you is wrong. There's nothing I do can make it right. But you should know that in her heart... ...there's only you. Why? Why she cheated on me? Forgive me, Glenn. If there's anything I can do. Anything at all. - Let's eat. - Yes, Mom. Here you go. Kania... I came here to return this. And also to apologize. What I said about you was wrong. That wasn't the reason why I invited you to a hotel room. I don't even know why I invited you. And I honestly don't know why did you accept my invitation. All I know I just wanted to be alone with you. I like hanging with you. It's been a while since the last time I've ever felt that way with any woman. We didn't just click, but it felt so right. I enjoyed every minute of our escapade. We were good as a team. We matched. But I'm deeply sorry. I have to save our marriage. Forgive me. It was all my fault. I shouldn't let myself fall in love with you. I should've just admired you from afar. I shouldn't want to keep the man that I adore for myself. You know, girls love to live in their fairy tales world. But there's just one thing that keeps on bothering my mind. Since you're going to save your marriage... ...that means you're gonna rekindle your relationship. And maybe grow old together. And I became a stumbling block that you keep in the back of your mind. But to me... ...when you came into my life, I opened my door for you. But then you break everything inside and now you're leaving me. Can you see the finished painting you've been working on all this time? You will embrace your future together. And here I am, all alone. But what bothers me the most is... ...I still don't know if you ever loved me or not. Even only for a moment. I can answer that. - I... - Glenn... - My feelings for you... - Glenn... What are you gonna say to me? That you loved me? Then what? How can I face the reality that I can never have you. Or do you want to say that you've never loved me? Either way, my heart is still broken. Knowing that you don't feel the same way. Please hold me. Hold me, Glenn. I'm so sorry. How about this one? Don't get your hope too high, Narissa. - But I want this. - This is cute. Look. Maya, you might be in shock to read this message. I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm alive. I wasn't on that plane. I was with Kania. I was cheating on you. Forgive me. I'll tell you everything. Because I want to hear everything from you too. About you and Yahya. I know about your affair. Let's talk at home. Sorry I made you sad. I'm coming home. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Can we start all over again? Yes, we can. Yes... Are you sure this is the place? Yes. They say this is the place where restless spirits are often seen. But don't you feel it's odd, the restless spirit should've been of the victim. But this time the burglar has become the restless spirit. It sounds like the title of a soap operaThe Mixed Up Roles. You're old. Today's trending soap opera is Azab. By the way, maybe the burglar got hit by a car and he died. And now he's become a restless spirit. Why? Because he didn't get the chance to break into a house. Why don't we hunt the ghost from our car? I can't stand the mosquitoes and I don't even know if they're alive mosquitoes... ...or the restless spirits of them. Why? Can you imagine, they didn't even get the chance to feed on us, and BAM! It's dead. You're insufferable.
