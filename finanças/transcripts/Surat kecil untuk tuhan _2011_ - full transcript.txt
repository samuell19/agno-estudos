Plato said that, "Poetry is closer to the truth than the history." I love poems, but for the honor to him. I love history, too. History has introduced me with many great people that time. Aristoteles, the philosophy, the greatest scholar to western, Platos student and the teacher of Alexander The Great. Then, there is Einstein. No one doesn't know him. A genius physician. Do you ever heard E=mc2? But not many people know if he had Asperger Syndrome and found spelling difficulties when he was young. And then, the two Google guys. Yup, Larry Page and Sergey Brin I representing the world to thanks to them. Just imagine if we had no search engine like Google. They are all my favorite. Young, idealis and genius. I believe in one hundred years later, their story will remind as the greatest in the world. Like Leonardo Da Vinci and his Monalisa. And one that most unforgettable Our prophet Muhammad Alaihi Salam The blessing for the universe. History also teach us about future What will I do today will be my provision But what makes me curious is how I will be remembered? How will my best friends will remember me? How will my siblings will remember me? How will my parents will remember me? Will my Mom remember me? How I will be remembered by my best friend which as my guardian, too? I dont know.

Keke really likes roses. She likes chocolate sticks. And then, she can't sleep without her star pillow. Oh yeah, she's a Japanese comic mania. So, don't be surprised if for example Keke likes to follow the comic style. Starting from her hair, clothes, just everything. Ndi, I want to talk for a minute. Yes, Ke. Ndi ... You go first. I want us to break up. It's better for us to be friends, Ndi. I want to focus on my illness first and I won't have time for us. But I ... Don't worry, we are still good friends.

There is something I want to talk with you You are the eldest. Already a grown up. If something happens with me, you have to replace it. I hope you care more about your family, especially your siblings. Papa wants you to stop all your bad habits out there. We should live with more concerned. What do you mean? Our family situation has changed, Chika. All my money is for medical expenses for Keke. Forget your wasteful racing hobby. I know I am the eldest in this family, Pa. I know, but that doesn't mean I have to be responsible of the troubles and messes that Mama and Papa have made. Since when did I not feel at home, when did I'm playing in the wild race? Since when, Pah? You couldn't answered right? Because all you see is that every night I just having fun, wasting money and racing But you never thought about my feelings! Everything's already messed up. Our family is a mess! Keke is sick. I always got headache just to think about it. Chika Brother.. I'm sorry I don't want to make you to be worried. Ok. Yes, good. Now, that's enough today. -Let's get our meal -Ok -I want yo eat meatball -Me too Wait me! Eh, Keke, is it hurt? No, it's okay. -Are you sure? -Really, it's okay I will go first. Yes. What's wrong? Nothing. That was just Fahda's towel hit my eye. -Is it really okay? -Yes Let's go. Ok. Wait a minute. Pa, my eye aren't good, Pa. This one Its reddish, Ke. We'll go to Professor, okay? Hai Why you hiding? I was told to take medicine You take it to get it fast recovery. Its bitter. Oh ya. I have this. Here, I'll open it Here. Papa once said What happens to us is God's will. Is the cancer grow again? My dear, Keke I'm sorry. Maybe I had sins in the past. Maybe I ever did wrong to others. I'm sorry, Dear Its should be Papa who is sick. It has to be me who bear all this, not Keke. No.. Forgive me, Dear. Bukan pa This is a trial This is a trial for our family. Dear God You're the most gracious one I am thankful for the deed that you have given me so that I can still gather with those whom I love my family, my friends Dear God Please, bestow your blessings of love among our family so that there are no more places to hate in our hearts. Dear God This man is so kind to me, also my family. Dear God Only to You I offer my love and life and I'm grateful in my short life you've shown me to feel the blessing of someone who sincerely loves me. Thank you, Dear God. I love you. Haven't sleep yet? I'm not sleepy yet. The sky is clear, Ke. Many stars become visible. Do you know? That one is called Sirius. Sometimes when other stars are covered by clouds, only that which can be seen. I want to be like Sirius. No matter how bad the weather is, it still shines brightly. Mr. Yodi, what I feared the most is finally happened. Keke's body responded negatively. What should I do, Prof? Can we talk for a second? the only way, we have to do a small operation by implanting a pipe that directs the medicine directly to the heart Ok, Prof. Please, do what you think is best. So that the pipeline does not clog, we'll inject the drug daily. -Ma -Yes? My pillow, please. This, Dear. Have a sleep, Keke. In the bottom, middle cupboard. Sorry, it's too simple, there's nothing. Stop mocking me. I'm here just for Keke. Why? Are you afraid to regret cause you've been wasting her? Do you think that staying a night can make amends forever? You know, you always think that the most right. Hei, Jodi. Even angels never punish others for feeling the most right. Keke, you woke up? Keke wants a vacation to the flower garden. Yes, dear. We'll go there on vacation, okay? You already know about Keke? I am confused. She is nice girl, but has a bad situation. Maybe I brought a bad luck. What do you mean? Do you remember, Keke was sick when we started dating. When we broke up, she recovered. After we returned, she is sick again. Yes, I do, but what I know is whether it with you or not, she will experience things like this. With your presence, Keke became stronger. Don't you remember? Only you can make her want to eat Because you are still stay, even though her face is already swollen. Maybe it's better if we didn't get back when she has recovered yesterday Why did it turn out this way? Nature, processes the body and protects the body against disease. What connects something to other to make a decision. You understand, right? My hair is about to run out. Here. Take this, Keke Here. Take it. Ke, take it. This, Ke. Take it. Thank you.. Thank you so much. You are my best friends. Hi, where have you been? What are you doing? Get down! I said get down!! I'd really like to race with you once in a lifetime. Take a strong grip. I really believe on you, Brother. Everything has changed. Our beautiful childhood is only a memory. There's nothing left, Ke. Maybe our family is not complete. I just want us to live like in the past. I used to rode my bicycle with you. I want you to care me when I'm hurt. I don't want to make you worried. I just want us to gather again. I stopped racing. Maybe the car can be sold to add to Keke's medical expenses. Forgive me, Cika. We can get through this problem together. I won't blame you anymore. Two. Ugh, brother! Keke? Sweetie, sorry I'm late. Come here, Mom. To carry out a patient operation, you need to provide a deposit up front, Ma'am. May I pay it half first, Miss? I'll pay it off later. Please wait a minute, Ma'am. I'll ask the manager. Mom, let's go. Wait a minute, Son. Hurry up. Hello. She cannot pay off yet. How is it? Oh, ok. I'm sorry, Ma'am. I can't help it. It's already our rules, Ma'am. Where do you want to go? It will be our turn soon. It has been two years, but I am amazed by Gita's pretension to get recovery. It turns out that this cancer is stronger than you. I have put all my abilities to defeated this cancer. And this is the limit. There is nothing I can do. But, Prof.. You are a doctor, a cancer expert. You can't give up easily! Thank you, Doc. I know how you did the best you could. Thank you, Doc. Please, be patient. Pa, do you bring money? Yes. Want to buy flowers? How many, Pa? What for? For that woman below. She wants to pay for his son's surgery, Pa. But ... I pity them, Pa. Her child is cute. I met him when he was still healthy. Now, his head is bald like me. Please. Eh, that's mine! My clothes. No Let's go. Da, please zip this up. What's wrong? I can't stop crying, Din. Keke Let's watch the performance of Akama Middle School! Oke, ready? Ready. Looking for Andi? No. Okay, this is the main event we've been waiting for, Rythm and Dance! Let me speak on behalf of my friends. For a long time we practiced together. All members of the arts club, including our best friend, Gita Sesa Wanda Cantika or Keke. It seems like we would never have been perfect tonight without her. However, it seems that God has other plans We present our performance tonight For you, our best friend. Yes. Keke insisted on taking the exam. Yes, Final Exam. Yes, let her do what she wants. Pah ... Yes Yes, Ke? Let's go. You said you want to take the exam? Yeah, but I can't move my legs. Looks like its paralyzed, Pa. -How could? -I do not know. Since when did this can't be moved? A moment ago after from the bathroom. Be careful. Ok, let see. Feel nothing, Ke? Let's go to Professor. I want to do the exam first, okay? We'll see the doctor later when I finish the exam. -Be careful -Ke ... Keke .... What happen? -Are you okay, ke? -Her legs ... her legs can't be moved. Yes, slowly, be careful. Come here. -Why are you still go to school, Ke? -I'll bring your bag. -Slowly, Ke. -Are you ok? Be careful, Din. Students, please entering the class. For those who still in front of the class. Give me the bag, Din. Yes, Sir. Fahda Are you okay, Ke? Mr. Yus Yes, Mon -My legs are okay. I can move them -Yes, Mon. Be careful, Ke. -Look -Slowly.. It's ok, right? Iya, Mon -Ya Allah! -Keke! I once said that I wanted to be Sirius The brightest star. But the scientist said The brightest star emits enormous energy as well, thus shortening its life. Right now I feel my light is almost dim. Come in. Assalamu’alaikum, Mr. Jodi Wa’alaikumussalam You called me, Sir? Ma'am, I know my daughter is very ill. Maybe her life won't be long anymore. Do not just because she is my daughter, the chairman here, then you biased her. I'm sorry, what you mean by that I biased her? Keke rarely attended school, because she need medical treatment. How could she possibly be the first in class? Mr Jodi, Keke is a smart kid. She deserves to be a class champion because of her own efforts This is the Keke's report that you asked for. Keke is sick and I know that, Sir, but she is still my smartest student. Let's pray Maghrib. This is Andi, Ke I'm sorry. I just coming now. I confused, Ke. I afraid of making Keke sick again. I'm sorry, Ke. But now I realized, Ke ... Indeed this is happening. Whether or not I near Keke, you'll still like this. I'm sorry, Ke. God, if you really want to take her, we accepted it sincerely. Yes, dear. Chika, Kiki. Just write it, dear. Yes, dear. We will get along, I promise. If you want to go Papa, brothers, we are all sincere. Forgive, Papa. Everytime we count stars in the sky But only despair is right about it. Like me, counting the sighs with your name. Only fatigue is able to know the amount. When eyes are closed… I can still see you. -Forgive us.. -No, Maybe when I closed my eyes I could see you. I want to be like the Sirius. Shine brightly in your heart. Mr. Jodi Gita is gone. Ya Allah... I will always be there for you, Ke. Now I've reached at the end of my journey, like a rain. I wonder how I will be remembered later. I leave everything to you.
