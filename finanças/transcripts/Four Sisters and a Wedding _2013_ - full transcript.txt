There's no one here. Just keep on watching. Someone might see us. - Alex, light! - OK. Here. Hurry up! My neck is getting sore. Please, help. I know what I'm doing, sis! - Bobbie. - Alex. - You want to fight, huh! - Stop it! - Stop it! - Can I join in? - Bobbie! - You still won't stop, huh! What? You're acting like kids. - It would be better if we parted ways. - You want our family to... Hurry, before it's too late! - Hurry up! - OK. This is delicious! We want Mom and Dad to make up. Please, keep them together so that us four can also stay together. - Thank you! - Thank you! - Oh! - What is it? Baby Jesus, can you give us a baby brother? - Good idea! - Good idea! Manang, stop that. Dust might get on the food. - Where's CJ? - I already called him. CJ! Mom, I need to take money from your retirement fund for the van repairs. Teddie didn't send her full share this month since she needs money for her new apartment. She's finally listening to me. I told her Mexicans make for bad roommates. Cubans, Mom. She said she can cover Teddie's share and send it next week. She's just a bit busy right now. Gabbie, have you sent off your MA application yet? - Manang, where is Toti Marie? - She's still out. So slow. Gabriella. Why do you keep delaying? - Teddie easily got a job abroad... - CJ! ...because of her MA. Mom. Who will take care of you and CJ if I leave? You're late. I have some things to do with my girlfriend. I mean, fianc√©e. Big sis... Mom. What? SPAIN Getting married? How I wish it were Nicole. But, no. The new one. Princess. The one he met on that cruise? - Can you call in the stand-in? - Sure. But she looks ridiculous! Huh? Who is this Princess, anyway? Hello, Teddie... Haven't you been reading my e-mails or my Facebook updates? I haven't checked my e-mail or Facebook for quite some time. I've been busy with training, seminars, you know. So, who is she again? The delusional, wannabe Broadway singer, who's short on both talent and looks. And words. When Rebreb introduced her to me, she barely talked and just clung to him like a leech. I haven't seen this girl yet and I already dislike her. Maybe she cast some witch's spell on our baby brother? CJ barely knows the girl. When did they meet? On the cruise, remember? Ah, yes, Rebreb went on a cruise to move on from Nicole. Thanks. Wait. So this is all your fault! Why me? It was Alex who came up with that idea. Excuse me, girl! You agreed with the plan! - Leo, where's Penny? - Back there. Besides, was I the one who bought the ticket? Had I known that that sister of yours was behind all this, She's pregnant? - Shotgun wedding? - No. Then what's the rush? He thinks it's true love, so why wait? Huh? Cheesy. Absurd. Nonsense. Yes! Totally lame... I knocked over my friend's drink. Apologies... Anyway, whatever our opinion may be, you all need to come home for the big event. What? Go home? Even me? Yup. It's Rebreb's wish and Mom's orders. - We all need to be there. - All of us? Even Teddie? Wait a minute. I'm not sure I can do that. I need to check my schedule. I've got so much to do. Lots of teacher seminars, you know. Hectic schedule. - Teddie! - I need to check... Here he is! My friends are here. - I'm going to unwind. I need to go! - Get cleaning now! I should fire you! OK, I'll call you. Bye. My apologies, sir! Going back to work, sir! - Don't you want to keep your job? - Yes. I do, sir. Sorry. Yes. What about Bobbie? - I'll also check my schedule. - Alex! Wait. The director is calling me. Penny! My savior. Come here. So? I'm sorry, Alex. It's the last day of shooting. I can't hand over the petty cash. I've got no money to lend you. Sorry. It's fine. No worries. - Alex! - Yes, sir! Do you want me to do your job, and you can direct instead? You escaped from your daughter early tonight. I give up. Just eat the biscuits Gabbie sent from home. Here. Your daughter's favorite. Such a beautiful hand. This would be a perfect fit. Are you sure you want to marry me? Trixie won't be happy. Just to remove all the gum she stuck to my hair. See? Just give this to her, and tell her it's from me. - CJ first. - What? Taho! Looks like your girlfriend got kicked out of her apartment again! Good morning, ma'am! I'm sorry for the mess. You forgot your phone again? I forgot to charge it. Went out drinking with the band after the gig. So, where are you going to stay this time? At home. All my sisters are coming home anyway. Rebreb is getting married. Oh? All of them are coming home. Even...? Excited? To go to sleep? Yes. You're walking out on me again? Text me when you're not acting crazy anymore. Hoo! The best! Come on. I really need your help. Hey! Please. - I'm waiting! - Yes. Right. Here. - What an idiot! - Frodo. Hey! Come on! Just this once! Lend me some money so we can go home together to Manila. - Please? - I can't, Teddie. I can't afford to spend a single penny right now. I'm saving all my money for something important. More important than me? Oh, don't do that to me. I really need you right now. Please. Why don't you just tell your family the truth? Admit that you've been laid off from your teaching post. They might send you some money. They might even pay for your ticket home. No way. Forget it. You don't know my family. No fair. You're being cute again. Fine. All right. Let's go home together. - Frodo! You're so kind, as always! - Aw, it hurts! I knew you wouldn't let me down, Frodo! You're the best! You're the nicest! Thank you. Because of that, I'll do anything you ask. - Anything? - Yes, anything! Just tell me. OK. Let me go with you to your brother's wedding. No. They might think you're my boyfriend. Introduce me to your family as your boyfriend. My love! Hey! Don't leave me behind! - You don't love me. - Correction. You don't love me. But I love you. Trixie, go with Auntie Bobbie. - Come on. - Trixie, go. CJ, you're still doing that? You need to set up the barbecue grill. Toti Marie! The ingredients? Done! Spices. Meat. Vegetables. Wash these, please. CJ, heat up the grill! Gabbie, are the rooms ready? Manang is cleaning them right now. You should be the one doing that. OK. - Let's review. - OK. Your mom was a high school principal. Your late father was a district superintendent. Alex is an assistant director. Gabbie's a teacher. Bobbie works in New York as a communications manager, and Gabbie stole Bobbie's boyfriend. - Correct? - Wrong. Alex did that. Alex. OK. Where are you? I'm still in my apartment, but I'm ready to leave. - What's the rush? - Bye, ma'am! They're at the airport already. They might even get here before you do. Manang, those are Alex's. Bring them to my room. I'm hurrying. About to start my car now. Toti, Teddie's goes back there. I'll sit here. - How about Bobbie's? - Manang, that's Teddie's. Wait a minute. Bobbie brought along two more. We need another chair. Why? There's a spot here. Teddie brought her boyfriend. Since when does Teddie have a boyfriend? - So we've been together for two years. - Two weeks. OK. You're not a waitress. You're not a maid at someone else's house. You are an English tutor and your top student is the cousin of the king's godson. The godson of the king's cousin. I'll get it. - No, I'll get it! - I'll get it! - No, I'll get it! - No, I'll get it! - No, you won't! - Ouch! Your big sister Teddie really has great taste. - Mom, that's Bobbie's boyfriend. - Huh? What? I'm Tristan. By the way, why do you need scissors? Bobbie! Bobbie! What happened? - What happened to your hair? - Who did this to you? Wait, calm down. It's messed up. - Give them to me! Here! - Come on. Don't move. - Sis, don't move. - Don't ruin it, please. Here. - Teddie! - Teddie! - I missed you! - My daughter! CJ! I missed you! - You're so beautiful, Teddie! - Good afternoon! Gabbie said you brought your boyfriend. Where is he? Mother! Finally, we meet each other. I am your daughter's one true love. I'm CJ. Frodo. Hey congrats, brother! - Mother! - I'm Teddie's boyfriend. I missed you so much. - It's OK. - Sorry. - Oh! Bobbie! - Manang! - Bobbie! - How are you? I've missed you! How are you? - Are you OK? - I'm fine, Mom. - Bobbie! - Big sis! - Thanks for coming. - Anything for you. Hey. What happened to your hair? What's this? - Frodo. I'm Teddie's boyfriend. - Hi! - Big sis! - Is she the one - you said... - Shut up. - Hey! - Big sis! Finally! The ones from abroad got here before you did! - Stuck in traffic, sorry. - It's fine, we're all here now. - Mom! - It's good you're here. - He asked. - Come on. - Hi. - She just arrived too. You look sophisticated. You look good! - How are you? - How have things been? - Teddie's boyfriend. - What? - It's true. - Seriously? Really? Wow. - Let's... all go inside! - Let's go! Where should I put these? - This goes to her room. - Me too, my love! Where's your room? Teddie, Bobbie, you're going to share a room. - Huh? - Huh? Well, you can stay with me in our old room just like before. - With Gabbie. - No. Wow, love! You never told me your family ran a gold mine. That's not even the half of it! Teddie's master's degree diploma is still not there. Do you have it? I'm sorry, Mom. I left it in Spain. It slipped my mind. I will just mail it. Where's your master's degree from Columbia? You finished already? - Mother just forgot. - Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I remember now. You already told me. Send it to me so I can have it framed. Let's go. Teddie, mail your diploma too. It should be displayed. We ran out of gold. Got it? Why did you have to bring her along? Tristan said it would be a good chance for me to bond with Trixie. I'm a gardener. - Oh, you! Don't be so humble! - Yes. - Mom, he's really a landscape architect. - Landscape architect. - Ah, landscape. - He's just too humble to admit it. I'm just a glorified gardener, a landscape architect. ...into the swimming pool! Teddie, is there an opening in your school? Maybe you can put in a good word for Gabbie. Mom, I'm doing just fine here. Looks like she is, Mom. She seems happy here. Let her be. Me again? My films are getting recognized. One even got into a film fest last year. Sorsogon Film and Arts Fest of 2012. What was that movie called again? And who was that actress? Something... Someday... Someday. Someday, Sisa Will Be A Star! - Starring Susan Suarez. - Who? - Someday, Sisa Will Be A Star! - Again? Someday, Sisa Will Be A Slut! Next Time in Sisa's... Watch the language! It's like you're all kids again. If not for the wedding, none of you might have come home. That's right, Manang. Good thing I'm getting married! Hey. Are you sure about that girl? Of course. Why? Is there a problem? Well, Alex said she's chararat. - Hmm? - Chararat? Why? What's chararat? Chararat... Chararat... Sugarcoating it. Ugly! Uhm, my love... I'm ugly too and you fell for me. He has a point. You're too young. Do you know what you're getting into? What about Mom? She was my age when she and Dad got married. That was a different time, Son. And they loved each other. We do love each other. Love? The length of our relationship is not important. There are couples who've been together for years and still break up. Her grandfather doesn't have long to live. He wants to see his great grandchild before he dies. What? What if she's infertile? Do you really think so little of me? That I'd marry her just for sex? She could be marrying you for sex. What if they really do love each other? Rebreb is a big boy. Let him be. Excuse me? The other day you were just as against the marriage as we were. That was the other day. He seems sure. Let's not ruin it for him. So what's the point of him having a parent and older sisters if we won't help him? It's our job to make sure he makes the right decisions... Why are you all so convinced he is making a wrong decision? He said he was sure, that he'd made the right decision to propose to Nicole. That was Nicole. This is Princess. They're different. Let them have their happily ever after. So, we'll just let him jump into this without thinking about it or planning it? That's it? Not everything needs to be thought about and planned. When you're lucky enough to find love... It's OK to disregard your family? Is that it? Yes. If that love gives you genuine happiness. Even if that happiness hurts other people? Really? Wait. Are we still talking about CJ? Yes. Maybe. You all have good points. But the one who needs to hear them has already walked out. Fix this. Let me do it. We're sorry. We're your sisters. We're overprotective of you because you're our baby brother. Sorry, but I really don't like her for you. But I will try to get to know her so that I can see what you saw in her. I was the only one defending you back there. - You called Princess chararat. - Oh. Are you still mad? Stop. Sisters. Can you please try to behave when we meet her family tomorrow? Tomorrow we have to behave. You're just like Mom. You think I'll screw up all the time. What? I was talking about us. We should all behave. All of us. No need to remind me. I have no issue with CJ getting married to Princess. It's you three. Especially that other one. Kept making sarcastic comments. You could be mistaken... There you go again. You keep siding with her. Siding with her? And what do you mean by, "again"? When did I ever side with her? When you... that time... then. None of you took my side, remember? That I took hers. You're both my sisters. OK. Fine. You win. Babe, you did well tonight. The whole family almost got into a fight. I don't want to talk about it. My babe is in a bad mood. Because it looks like we have something to talk about. Do you really need to get reassigned abroad? Babe, this means I'm getting a promotion. Sleep here with me. Your daughter is right there. Lock the door next time, OK? Come on. Don't hide your face. But I'm shy. Plus, I want you to really miss me before tomorrow. Teddie, you're still up. I'm just so proud of our achievements. - Really? - Love? Love, wait. Wait. I just want to say good night. Wait a minute. Can I get a good night kiss? Tristan got a good night kiss from Bobbie, right? Oh, you! Ouch. Good night, love! Get some sleep. My love, I'm scared for tomorrow. You think they will like me? Of course. They haven't met you yet and they already like you. Great! This house is huge. CJ, you never mentioned your girlfriend lives in a mall. Big house. Not big-headed, I hope. What? - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - "Sir?" Your sisters are so beautiful. But where is your mom? Is she coming? You must be joking. Welcome, Grace! Call me Boy. Dad, let me introduce you to my big sisters. This is Gabbie. This is Teddie. She is an English tutor of the King's son. Right? I meant she lives in Spain. - Bobbie. - By the way, I'm... Roberta. Wow, I'm getting a nosebleed from all that English. That accent will give me a nosebleed, too. That is Manang and that's Toti. Hi, ma'am. No! Not Janet. Jeanette. Get it right. Jeanette. Ma'am, where is Princess? Princess Antoinette... May Bayag. Oh, you should see the church. - That's the theme? - No. For the entourage dresses, the theme is "Under the Sea". It symbolizes CJ's and Princess' first meeting at sea. Hold on. You're kidding, right? Are you serious? Do I look like I'm kidding? And because the theme is Under the Sea... while the entourage and bridesmaids will be the sea creatures from the ocean. - Huh? - What? Hurry! Here. Sea horse and octopus. Isn't it? Do not fret, my dear. Pedring is already taking care of the dresses. Just one look at the photos CJ sent him and he already knew all of your measurements. So, the gowns are done, huh? And you're taking care of all the expenses? So what is our contribution? We are taking care of everything. So you think it's an issue for us? I never said that, my dear. Is that what you think? Well, you can think that now. Love, sorry. I had no idea. You know that what you earn in a month, I can earn in an hour. You might not be able to support the lifestyle Princess is used to. - I am just protecting my... - Um, excuse me. What do you think my brother is going to do to your daughter? Use her for money? It's not like that at all. This is just a precaution. I do not want my daughter on the losing end. Losing what? They're not even married yet and my brother's already lost. Sisters. Ma. My intentions are pure. They better be. Gramps! Hello. - Hello. - CJ, remember what I told you? Take care of my granddaughter or else I will haunt you after my death. - Sir. - Gramps? - Gramps. - Sir. Gramps, are you OK? - Water. Give him some water. Sir? - Grandfather! Are you OK? - Are you OK? - Oh, my God. - Water! - Give him room! Call an ambulance. Go. Sir? Hurry! You got us there! I hate them! Such snobs. Just because they're rich? And what was the prenup for? Do they think we are going to steal their filthy money? I bet their money is dirty. They're shady. And Princess, "shining, shimmering, splendid..." She is a good girl. And her parents are good too. Even if they're condescending? - Arrogant? - And ill-mannered? Their manners are different from ours. But regardless of how they are, you shouldn't have behaved that way. Especially you, Bobbie. Mom, Bobbie was just trying to defend us. And you, too. That was still the family of CJ's fianc√©e. CJ wants to be a part of that family. Show some respect. Are you OK? Nothing. Wait! Let's meet in the kitchen in five minutes. I will just change. So what are we going to do? Hey! Are you with us? I have a Skype call with my boss in a few minutes. OK, then. Think. Come on. I'm sure the Bayags are dirty. Teddie. Bah... Yag. Whatever! Those Bayags reek of dirt. Teddie. Obviously, they did not start out rich. And you don't get rich that fast. If those Bayags are clean... Teddie! Sheesh! Think! Come on! But, in all seriousness, what business are the Bayags in? So she is listening. Let me see! "Papa's Spa. Endless joy. We give happy endings"? I knew it. Those Bayags are dirty. You have no evidence. - She has a point. - I know. Superstition. If one of us gets married first, they will be scared to get married in the same year. I'm out. Frodo and I only just got together. You're ruled out too, old maid. - You do it then. - Why me? You're the one with the longest relationship. Why not Bobbie? Are you willing? I'll ask Chad. Chad? Yeah, right. Bring back the past! Bring back the past, and you shake up the present. Who's the present? Princess. Who's the past? Nicole. Bobbie, find Nicole on Facebook. She will help us stop this wedding! When the priest says, "Any objections?" She will say, "I object!" Number one, Nicole is not here. And two, why would CJ leave Princess for a girl who hurt him and actually became the reason he met Princess? Back to square one. What are we going to do, Bobbie? What? CJ's what? I think that's it. Isn't that it? Why didn't she just say so? Why did your family leave in such a hurry? - Did they not like me? - Of course not, my love. I think they were surprised. They've never met someone with a unique sense of fashion like you. So what do we do, my love? What do I have to do to make them like me? You don't need to do anything. Are you sure? I love you, so they will learn to love you too. Gabbie! Alex! Gabbie! Faster! Alex! Faster! You two! - Oh, my goodness! - Teddie! Gabbie, call Toti Marie. Hurry! Hurry! Now! Remember what Bobbie said last night? - Get up and listen to my plan. - Quiet! Remember what she said? CJ fell for Princess only because he lacked options. Well then, let's give him options! And show him what he will be missing if he marries Princess. I'll talk to Chad. He can give us a list of the best bars to meet women. Sis. A decent bar, OK? Yes! We only want decent girls for CJ. College graduates, prim and proper, smart, sweet, sophisticated. And one who doesn't wear a disco ball to meet the family. Girls with unparalleled beauty. Perfect! Just like Nicole. And don't tell CJ we put you up to this, OK? We had nothing to do with it. OK? If you tell him we're involved, we will deny everything. - Have what? - The budget! You expect me to shoulder the whole thing? - Huh? - Boys night out. You're late. You pay. This is wrong! CJ, I prepared all this for you! You said it would be decent. Hey! These are decent girls! They all came here in school uniforms. CJ, just sit and relax. Come here! Sit! CJ, all grooms need a bachelor's party. Just look. - Any luck contacting CJ? - No. And Tristan? No luck either. Where the heck did they go? - Toti Marie didn't say. - What time does Mom wake up? She's usually up for breakfast by seven. - Come on! Wait for our call, OK? - Huh? Let's file a missing person's report with the cops. I think you're overreacting, Teddie. So where do we look? There are a zillion bars around here. But what if they get here ahead of you? Fine. I'll call you when they get here. - What? - What the...? - CJ! Wake up! - They really bonded! Tristan, your daughter might see you. Where have you been? And what did you do in the motel? What? Window shopping? Toti! How do you even window shop in a motel? - I did what you said... - What? You told me to give him a good time. Show him what he will be missing if he marries Princess. - Introduce him to other girls. - Window shopping. To give him options! Options! Shopping! Surprise! - Hey! - Aw! I said "decent bar"! Is a motel decent to you? You're so stupid. - Come on. - Open the gate. Come on! Get out! - Let's go before mom sees you like this. - Come on. Hey! This was not my idea. You're the one who said the only reason CJ fell for Princess was because he lacked options, so I let him have options. CJ! Hey, I didn't tell Toti to hire prostitutes for the party! That was her stupid idea. Then next time, just shut up so you don't get misinterpreted. If you don't want my opinion, then stop asking me for it. And you, Gabbie. You actually agreed to this? Because she had the same interpretation of what you said. Why? What did you think? Maybe CJ was right. You do think little of him. Hey! That's below the belt. Why? When I tell you the truth, it's a low blow, but when you tell a hurtful joke, it's nothing personal? They're jokes. They shouldn't hurt. You just have an answer for everything! What happened to CJ? Drunk after a boys' night out. So that's why. I woke up feeling like I had to bring hot chocolate for breakfast. It will get rid of his hangover. Manang! CJ, we're so meant to be. I know what you need even before you tell me. My CJ is so cute. Oh, no! All of you look exhausted too. But don't worry. I will cook breakfast for all of you. What do we do with the breakfast you cooked? We'll still serve it. Wow, Gabbie! Those look delicious. They are delicious. Mom, your meds. Come on! Let's eat. Is this what Princess cooked? No, Mom. Are you OK? Eat up. What brand is this mix? Oh, no. That's my own recipe, Mom. Teddie, taste it. - No, I'll just stick to Filipino food. - Bobbie, taste it. Bobbie. Have a taste. Gabbie, you should try it. It's good. I don't like anything sweet. The gig ended late. Is that Chad? - Mom. - Good morning. My love! He's Chad Quinto! He's my idol! Oh my! He's so handsome! Why didn't you tell me that you knew him, my love? Do you know I've had a crush on you since I was in high school? Oh, my love. Please, don't get jealous over this. I've been your biggest fan since high school! Your songs are the soundtrack of my life! I dreamed about marrying you. But you're too late now. I already found my love. Is it OK if you sing me my favorite song later? Trixie, take a shower... Why did you have to bring him here? Why? Hasn't she moved on? Everyone's boyfriends are with them. Why can't I have mine? I'll just place it here. Oh! The kid can spell better than her. She doesn't know. You really think I would tell her what happened between him and Bobbie? Looks like that song brought back some memories, huh? Wow. You really felt it. Did I choose the song? I didn't say you did. You were giving her the gaze. Like a lovestruck boy. With piercing eyes... Really killer looks. Who asked me to come here? Who invited me? Who insisted? You should have just put blinkers on me, like a horse, to prevent me from looking. I should not have come here. Hey! I was just kidding! Hon! I knew it! I told her she shouldn't have invited him over. I feel sorry for Tristan. This could cause a rift between him and Bobbie. Let her be. She's Miss Smarty-Pants. She'll know how to fix their rift. She knows everything. Teddie... Isn't that why she keeps blaming us? Because she knows everything. I don't think she meant to offend you. Well, she should learn to shut up if she doesn't want to offend people. She talks to us like we're her employees. I'm still the eldest here. Look, are we really going to fight over this? We all want the same thing. To stop CJ from marrying Princess. What do we do now? What about... that spa? I'll look into it. I have a gut feeling there's something there. But Bobbie said that will never work unless we have evidence. Oh! Bobbie again! Right. Fine. I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it. If I make a mistake, it will be all my fault. Bobbie won't need to say, "I told you so." I'll take the blame. Why did you bring Chad here? How long will it take for you to welcome him to the family, Mom? I will welcome him once you've made up with Bobbie. But, Mom... You know I've apologized to her a million times. Ever since she got back... I've been trying to talk to her and make up. Just like you wanted, right? But she always snubs me. It's not fair that I'm always the one trying to make it up to her. It's high time she forgave me. Will you always think I'm wrong? It's your timing that's wrong. Don't forget to pack your passport. Want us to take you to the airport tomorrow? I'd forgotten all about it. I know. Cheesy. I only heard it once... Aunt Bobbie loves you. I think it's hopeless between me and her. When I get back, this should be on your finger. Is this an ultimatum? Kid has a point. How long will you make him wait? You could just end it, you know. He looks like a good guy. He looks like he's in love with you. You look like you love him. Right? Why don't you marry him? You've been together a while. I could say the same for you and Chad. You love him. He loves you. Why don't you marry him, then? You know nothing about how I feel. - Is everything OK? - This is what I don't... Hi. Where's Chad? Fix it. This is... Come here. You're at it again! You don't need to be jealous of her, OK? Marry me. I'm kidding. Just thinking about how to stop Rebreb's wedding. I got you. Well, you looked serious. Best actress here. I'm really sorry. I'll send money as soon as I can. I've got a lot on my plate right now. My love needed my help. Of course. I'll visit soon. There. - Papa's Spa. - See? Wow! This is exciting. I knew it. There's something fishy about these Bayags. Sir, our happy ending package is the best seller. Happy ending for one. Yes! Sure. Remember, call me before the happy ending happens. Yes, love. You're here to expose them, not for fun. Call me when you get your happy ending. - Don't forget, OK? - Yes. I won't. - This way, sir. - OK. Don't forget! The pride and future of my brother is at stake here. I know. Oh, never mind. Remember, the pride and future of your brother is at stake here. I know. Ouch! See you later, love. Let's go. Is that you I'm hearing? - Sir, are you ready for your happy ending? - Huh? Happy ending? I'll call Alex's contact now, OK? Don't enjoy it too much! Are you ready? Are you ready, sir? No peeking, or else the happy ending won't be as pleasurable. Sir! Thank you for coming at such short notice! - The happy ending is here. - Where? - Through here. - Hey, that's the men's area. Shut up. Chief, it's time we expose the illegal activities of these Bayags. Think about what would make you happy right now. What is it, sir? For Teddie to tell me she loves me back. - Restroom. - What? Oh, yes. - Are you feeling happy, Sir? - Yes. Oh, yes. Sir... it's here. It's here. Open the door! Teddie? Sir, is she your happy ending? Wait! I thought... this... Where is the happy ending? It's done. He had his happy ending. Actually, you were his happy ending. Huh? Chief... it's... it said in the... So, you're his happy ending. Case closed. Your mind is too dirty... That means happy thoughts, ma'am. I'm so sorry. I made a mistake. Next time, don't advertise a "happy ending" in your spa. The happy ending package is what made our spa famous in the first place. Our happy ending So, you're trying to find dirt on the Bayag family. I wonder if I should do the same to the Salazars. Huh? My family is clean. Love... - Love, calm down. - What do you mean "calm down"? Didn't you hear what that Jeanette said? She's going to investigate me. Do you think she already knows the truth? About me? About us? You think she already had me investigated? - I guess. - You guess? - Maybe. - Maybe? - Why don't you just come clean? - About what? The truth, that I'm not an architect, and you're not a teacher. Say that when Spain's economy crashed I was one of the teachers who got fired? Because the principal thought I wasn't that good anyway? Because he thought I wasn't that smart? Huh? They're your family. They will understand. Especially your mom. My mom will understand that her favorite daughter is a failure? Not to mention, a fake and a liar? Is that it? Huh? It was just a suggestion. Then next time, make sure your suggestion is worth my time! Don't just say whatever thoughts come into your stupid mind! Right! I am stupid because I keep following you around. - I'm sorry. - No! Why, Teddie? Princess and her family did not deserve this! That's the business of the family I'm marrying into. The one you'll be related to! The one who'll have my children! What happened? - I'm really sorry. CJ, I'm sorry. - She pushed through with the spa. I just assumed there was something wrong when I saw they were offering a happy ending. Well, you assumed wrong! Do you know that Uncle Boy wanted to sue you? I had to get on my knees and beg him not to go through with it! If it were me, I would have had you arrested! She was wrong. She admitted it. She apologized. I want to know why she did it! We don't want you marrying someone with a questionable background. Why didn't you stop Teddie? Are you part of this? - Are you, Gabbie? - We all are. - We just don't want you to... - All of you? Bobbie, you agreed with this? I did not agree to any plan we talked about... So you made plans? All of you? What were you trying to do? We wanted you to realize that Princess is not the girl for you. Didn't you promise to behave before you met them? Yes! And we did, just like you asked. Even when your future in-laws were being insensitive and judgmental. Just because they wanted a prenup, they're judgmental? Aren't they? Hello? They insulted you. They insulted us! - Are you letting that slide? - Oh. Hold on. - You talk as if you're a saint! - What? I'm still offended that you called Princess chararat! Am I not entitled to my own opinion about your ugly girlfriend? How would you feel if I called Chad an asshole? Huh? Well, he is an asshole! Because he banged both you and Bobbie! - But it's true! - Shut up! That's enough! You shut up! - You're intruding in my life! - We're doing it because we love you! Think about that before you raise your voice at all of us. CJ, I was just trying to protect you. We prayed to God for you. I know you did. I'm no longer a baby! Unlike all of you! Learn to accept the fact that I'm marrying Princess whether you like it or not! What made you go through with this stupid plan? Bobbie... - No wonder he's so mad! - Hey... What were you thinking? Were you even thinking at all? My God! I get it, I messed up. Stop shoving it in my face! Instead of making him leave Princess, it made him do the opposite. How stupid! I was wrong, but I'm not stupid! - What? Did I say you're stupid? - You just did, didn't you? You're misinterpreting me again. - I said the idea was stupid. - No, you did. - You just said it. - Please, stop it. If only you would let me finish speaking! This is why you always misinterpret what I say. - Stop making excuses, Bobbie! - What? You think being a New Yorker makes you better than us! It's always about you and how good you are! Hey! You've done nothing but fight ever since you... Is there a problem? No, Mom. We're just playing... Charades, Mom. - Charades. - That's right. Your turn. Worrying is bad for you, remember? You wouldn't want to get stressed. You might get sick again. I'm just sad, Manang. I had hoped that when all my children came back home... they would all get along again, just like when they were kids. If only they could remain as kids, huh? Always having fun. They'd fight, then make up in an instant. They'll get around to that, even though they're all grown up. Of course, it's harder to do it now... having their own beliefs, opinions, and principles to uphold. But, if you think they will drift apart because of it, well, that's never going to happen because their lives are intertwined. It's intertwined because of the love of their mother. Stop worrying! Stop stressing out! Oh. What now? Here! You ready? - Thank you, sir. - Thank you! Let's go! Frodo, where are you? ORPHANAGE ADDRESS Trixie, careful! You might fall! Just let me know when you'll be back, OK? Are you going out today? Where did Teddie go? Where's Alex? Why the roll call? Wherever you're going, make sure you get home by 5 p.m. The Bayags are coming over. Mom, I have work today. A small sacrifice for your baby brother. Damn it! I can't get a break in this house! Alex. Can we talk? Maybe later. I saw Chad with another girl last night. So what? He's cheating on you. Just because he's with another girl, he's cheating? Can't he have other female friends? They were flirting while buying condoms. Friends? Why are you telling me this? To let you know that Chad is playing you. Wow! Concerned, huh! Didn't you say, Did I get it right? I've said my piece. I've done my part as your sister. What? Didn't hear that for five years! So, I'm your sister? Don't feel like one, since you've been avoiding me for the past five years after your ex-boyfriend and I got together. After everything you've done to me, you expected me to keep talking to you? You'd already broken up before I came into the picture. You coming into the picture is why we broke up. You broke up because you left him. You left him for a job in the US. Future my ass! You just wanted to get ahead! All you cared about was your career, right? - Chad almost lost it when you left him! - So you replaced me? How many times did I tell you to take him back? And less than six months later you became a couple! Hey! I asked for your blessing! I told you Chad was hitting on me! I asked you if it was OK for us to get together. You gave your blessing! Of course! It came from your mouth! - I didn't do anything wrong! - Yes, you did! - Don't go all English on me! - English or not, Admit it. You've liked Chad for a very long time. But he courted me. Fine! You win! You're right! I am wrong again! I stole him from you! I'm the stupid one! I'm a big mistake! The only things I ask of you, Alex, are responsibility and respect as sisters. I see. So I'm a bad sister. Frodo didn't say you were coming. He doesn't know. How wonderful. He finally gets his first visitor. It's a shame. Frodo was such a good kid. But nobody wanted to adopt him for some reason. He spent his whole life here. And after he got a job in Spain, he stayed here whenever he came home. He's like family now. - And you? - Frodo, where's my dress? - Your dress? - Where is my dress? - And my rubber shoes? - Wait. Hold up. Sorry, I did not have the budget for them. Your big brother Frodo had to help a friend in need. I felt bad for her. But I promise to send them next time. Rubber shoes. Dress. All of it. Is that OK? - Bro, give me that! - This is delicious! Walk in line. Don't cut in ahead. Bye, brother. I'm sorry. I even deprived the kids. It's OK. Don't worry about it. Actually, it's not OK. Because while we continue this act, a lot of people are getting hurt. I know. It's just so hard because... all my life... what they know... it's so hard to tell them that I'm just a maid. Your family will understand. They will still love you. If they don't love you, so what? I'll still love you. Even if you're annoying sometimes. Your house is so shiny, Grace. Full of gold. We may not have much money, but we'll always be rich with gold. But that's not true! Those are fake! That is what they are. What do you mean? Those are gold-plated. Look! Would you actually put real gold on display? Teddie's here, and my larger-than-life wedding gown... There you go! She's here in the Philippines. Wow! There they are! Let me hold them instead! Chararat? French word for? Different. Don't sugarcoat it. They're hideous, Mrs. Bayag. Just plain awful. We can't possibly wear those to the wedding. But you have to wear these! Mother, let's not force the issue. But these gowns cost a lot of money! We'll just pay for them. How much are they anyway? Lend me money. On second thought, the gowns are just fine. Let's just wear them. I knew it! You can't afford these gowns! I don't need your help. I worked hard on these for Princess. They didn't help us in any way. And there's no time. We will fix this. I believe that compromise is needed. Since we did not consult you about the gowns, I understand why you don't want to wear them. Thank you, Boy. But I also don't want my wife's efforts to go to waste. If you win, wear whatever you want, even your underwear. I don't care. But, if we win, Honey Girl, I have made my decision. What game? - Everybody. - All of us? I know! - Jesus Christ Superstar! - Three syllables, English. Then, Jesus Christ. That's three syllables. - Be serious! - Trying to be a smart ass... - Titanic! - All right! - Yes! - My daughter is so bright! You're so good! They're good. How can that mean song? "She Bangs!" - What food? - That's Tagalog. - Bitter gourd? - Bitter gourd juice? How does that sound like Bobbie? Alex! Peanut bitter! Bitter Ocampo! - Alex, what? - What? Alex, what are you saying? - You're too talkative! - Stern! Unforgiving! Cold-hearted bitch! - None! - What the heck? Barbecue. How does that sound like Bobbie? - Matador! - A song. It's OK. Let's just catch up with them. Go, love! It's your turn now. Go. Oh. I thought you meant a snake. When Harry Met Slutty? Oh, sorry. I meant Sally. My God, Bobbie! Filipino? What is it? Sisa Will Soon Be A Star. The movie she worked on! Looks like they have an inside joke. All maids! Maid in Manhattan! I knew it! Come on, Mom. Let's continue playing. Something's off. They've been making fun of Teddie all night. Why are you making fun of my daughter? - Grace, we bear you no ill will. - No. You're making my kid the butt of your jokes. Why are you subjecting my daughter to such ridicule? Because she is so ridiculous! My daughter is ridiculous? You're the ridiculous one! Grace! You are in my house. You have no right to insult or make fun of any of my children! Get out! The exit is that way. It would be my pleasure! But before I go, I just want to make one thing clear. These are perfectly real and not fake! Unlike your daughter! - My daughter is not fake! - Mom. Who are you to investigate her? Take the gowns with you! Princess! Let's go! - We don't belong in this house! - They didn't even acknowledge our efforts! Theodora... Is there something I should know? What? Teddie, tell her. You know what this is about? We've known since last year. Last year? When Bobbie was supposed to go to Madrid for her birthday vacation. You didn't want me to go, remember? You said you had a teacher's conference in Paris? I still went to Madrid. I saw you in a bar. But I stayed away because... I knew you'd be ashamed. I didn't want to tell anyone else if you weren't ready to do so. What? - What do you know that I don't? - Alex, just be quiet. Quiet? Teddie is my sister too. It's my sister you're pressuring right now. - Alexandra! - We're not pressuring her. So what is it? Teddie... Why me, Mom? Mom, it would be better if it came from her. Teddie, we're your family. If anyone should know who you really are, the true you, it should be us. How long are you going to keep up the lie? Do you think this is easy for me, Bobbie? Then tell us, so you can breathe easier. Fine! I'll admit it! Mom... When the recession hit Spain... I was one of the teachers who got laid off because they said I wasn't good enough. And I also didn't get a master's degree because I wasn't given a scholarship grant. Ever since I was fired from the school... I took on multiple jobs to earn money so that I could send you some. I served as a waitress in the bar Bobbie mentioned. I also took a job as a maid. That's where I met Frodo. The truth is... I borrowed money from him to pay for the trip home. I wouldn't understand? It's not like that, Mom. I know that whatever happens, you'll still love me. But I'm the one with the problem. I'm the one who couldn't accept my fate. I haven't achieved anything you wanted for me, Mom. I'm the least successful out of everyone. Sis. And whatever I do, I can never be as good as Bobbie. - Me? - Yes, Bobbie! You! Whatever you put your mind to, you're always the best at it! But no matter how hard I try, I can never get to your level. You were always better than us, weren't you? You were the smartest one. The prettiest one. It was always you! You're my sister, Bobbie, and I love you, but... I've always been jealous of you. I can't help it, Bobbie. Why do you sound mad? Did I do something wrong? I'm actually the odd one out feeling jealous of all of you... because you all have something I don't. I wish I had your maternal instinct. I wish I was as adventurous as Alex. I wish I had your sense of humor because I think you're so funny. Mother does too. I guess that's why she gives you so much attention. That's not true. Mom, remember when I was in grade school, and I graduated as the Valedictorian and got so many medals? And then Teddie got one? You chose to praise her. And do you remember... when I went home real hungry? You got mad at me for eating the food you'd saved just for Teddie. And, one time you bought a pair of pants from the mall... and you said I should wait for Teddie to pick hers out first. She was the eldest, so she got to pick first. It's OK. I understand. I've accepted it... that Teddie and CJ get special treatment from you. They are your favorites. And Papa's favorites were Alex and Gabbie. Because the fact that you raised me was enough. You fed me. You gave me an education and dressed me. You loved me. You and Papa. Because growing up... Alex was there. I was her favorite. Before. But... now, ever since I came home... all I've heard from everyone is that I'm a smartass, that I'm a bad person. That I'm such a bitch for being too harsh with my words. I'm sorry if you feel that way. I'm cold... Bobbie, that's not true. Maybe that's what I really am. Because I chose to be that way. I had to be. Especially when I went to New York. Alex, maybe you're right. I prioritized my career. I left everything behind to succeed. But believe me, I did not do that for myself. Because we were deep in debt from Papa's illness. Then Mother had an operation. Then CJ had to go to college. Gabbie wasn't earning enough. Teddie needed money to go to Spain. And you were still looking for a job. And I didn't want you to stop pursuing a film career because you said you found joy in it. That was your forte. You wanted to succeed for Mom. So despite my strong desire to go home, because I was so lonely... I chose not to for you. Even though I missed you. I held myself back. I steeled myself. I made sacrifices because I needed to. But just because I'm cold doesn't mean I can't get hurt. That I have no feelings. I'm hurting right now. I'm sorry, Bobbie. Mom, I'm not judging you, OK? I focused on Teddie and CJ because they were weak. They were sickly, remember? They always needed attention. But you three... You were strong. Brave. Bobbie, I'm sorry. OK? I'm sorry. And you, Teddie. I'm thankful for you too. You made sacrifices in Spain, as well. No matter what. You're smart too. OK? I'm sorry if I had any shortcomings, OK? Mom, I'm the one who should be apologizing. I've never helped you in any way. I always rebelled against you. Even though I gave you a hard time... I just wanted to prove to you that I could make it - so that you'd be proud of me. - I know, Alex. I know. I love you, Mother. Teddie's crazy. She thinks she's the least among us. But it's obvious who the petty one really is. Don't say that. - No one is petty in this family. - Right. We're just different. Don't sugarcoat it. It's OK. I've accepted it. Maybe that's why I dated Chad, too. Bobbie, when you and Chad broke up, and he tried hitting on me... I tried to control my feelings. Really. I tried. Because I wanted you two to get back together again. But... It eventually became... difficult... because... it felt so good to be appreciated by someone. When you left... I lost my best friend who understood me, and who accepted me... for who I am. That's why I got so hurt when you got mad at me. I felt... that I had no right to be happy. I had no right to be loved because he was my sister's ex. Because I wanted to be loved so badly, I hurt you. I'm sorry, too. I was so hurt... that I couldn't see that you've been hurting, too. - So, are we best friends again? - Best friends. - I'll make it up to you. - Me too. But... But I think there's someone that we need to see first. Hurry! Come on! Wait, Alex! Where are you going? We'll go with you. Who knows what that bastard will do? Relax. We're just going to talk. He's not like that. No! Bring Bobbie with you! - Sis. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Go! If you need back-up, we'll be right here. I chose you over my family. I hurt my sister because of you. But they're right. You're just playing me. I wasted my life for you. That's for me. That's for Bobbie. You asshole! - Hon. - Just leave that desperate bitch! That's what I'm saying... - What did you say? - Alex... Come here! Alex! - What the hell? - Chad! - Alex! - Come here! Come on! Faster! - Alex! - Alex, what are you doing? - Come here! - Don't interfere. What happened? She called me a desperate bitch! How dare you? What are we going to do with her? Hit her! - Look at what you've done. - Ah! - Get ready, bitch. - They want me to hit you! - Hit her! - Knock her out! One! Two! Three! Run! Hey! That's enough! - Hey, that's enough! - CJ. Let's go! Hey! Let's go now. That was awesome! What? Where is she? - Hurry up! She isn't here yet. - OK, It's harder to memorize now! I have my shield! They're very playful. They like to smear each other like that. You, too! And me, too! Ah, you want to fight, huh! Now, the kids are playing! - Attack! - Sis, I don't want to! Sis, don't! Remove her hands! Wait! I might trip! She's coming! What's happening? What's going on? - One step down. - Oh. Why do you girls look like that? What are you doing? Mom, we made something for you. You are our favorite Mom! Well, you don't have a choice! I'm your only mother. - Oh, that's not true! - Oh, our drama queen! My favorite of all. Stop it! You look like... For looking after Mother. And for taking care of us. Thank you, dear. Thank you, too, Mom. Thank you, sisters. What's this? You'll finish your MA in New York, OK? You'll stay at my place. So that you and mom won't fight anymore. What about mom? What's the point of me being a maid? I'll be the one to look after Mom. And I know that Bobbie will give me a fat paycheck. Really? OK. I'll double your salary. Yes, please. I need money for shopping. That's why! That's for Rebreb. He was named after those. That's why he's sweet! Yes? The wedding's not happening? Why? Dear. Thank you. Thank you for your sympathy. Thank you, sisters. My condolences. My condolences. My condolences. Thank you so much. Thank you. I think, it's better this way. He no longer feels pain. I'm sorry for everything that has happened, Mrs. Bayag. It's OK, Teddie. We were a little hurt by what happened because you thought poorly of us. But, like what I've said, What really saddens me... - is CJ and Princess' wedding. - That's OK, mom. But I've already paid the church. The reception. The gowns. Even though they're ugly. It won't go to waste. There will be a wedding tomorrow. Isn't that bad luck? Let's go, man! They're all waiting for you! - Why? - Come on! Bobbie told me the wedding was cancelled? Come on! Let's go! There's cologne there! Go put some on! Fix yourself! Let's go! That way! Quick! Let's go. - He's here! - Hey. Ah, Teddie... I thought the wedding was cancelled because of the curse. You were right. This fits my finger perfectly. Just like you. You're the right one for me. They're just like us, love. Love? You love me, too? We're not the ones getting married. Save it for next year. Hey! You can't get married next year! We're getting married. I wonder when we'll get married. Yes, they've already kissed! So cheap! What did I do? So cheap! How do I open this! Ouch! My hair got stuck! Wait. I can't move. Can you... Can you remove this? - It's OK! - Sorry. - I'm acting it. - It's blocking my way! Didn't you tell me... - What did you tell me again? - What? Didn't you tell me... Wait. What is it? Give me this. Director! You cut there! Wait a second. Why do I keep on saying "finally!" Grandfather! - It's so weird. - No, it's cute! Can I... - Buy... - What? - Buy? - Buy? Buy a baby brother! She's going to dig up information about me! What is he doing? What's happening? Why isn't your master's degree certificate from... Why isn't your master's degree certificate from... Oh, Mom! - That's crazy! - That's for bloopers! - Ouch! - What's that! This is crazy! Chad? Maid in Italy! Oh, sorry! Sorry, director! I can't take it! You're so good! Oh, my God! - Connie, are you OK? - I'm already laughing!
