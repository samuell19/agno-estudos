Dzhamanov Directed by L. Shepitko Hey, Sadabek! Come out! Dzhumash is here! - Hi, Aldey! - Hello. Getting anywhere with your work? Ah, getting nowhere, we're stuck with thorns. - Welcome, aksakal! - Good day. Now everything will go swimmingly. - I've brought you an assistant. - Oh. Salaam, Abakir. Here are the cigarettes. Finally! Thank you for the help. So where's the assistant? Where? He's running after me. Sadabek! Look, he looks like our Asan! - He's almost a child. - Good morning! That's a hell of an assistant. I didn't want to take him at all. But he's got an assignment from Komsomol. They told me to take him or there would be trouble. What could I do? And so here we are. So, Kemel, have you opened your eyes? Meet your foreman. Unload your stuff. Dzhumash, what about mail? Have you brought us a letter from our son? Aldey, nowadays only parents write frequently. And for letters from children one can wait forever. Here, this is for you. And this is for Abakir. It must be a mistake. I never receive letters. I know. But this one is for you. It says: to Abakir Dzuraev. To Abakir Dzuraev? That surname rings a bell. Is he an actor? Is the report ready? Are you sure it's not rigged? Other units are failing to fulfil the plan. Why don't you rest a bit, Dzhumash? I can't. My young wife is waiting for me. Dzhumash, let's have a drink! Is he my substitute? Is he replacing me? Not yet Be patient, Sheishen We don't have enough people He'll keep you company. Take care! - Good bye! - Are you kidding? You've promised! I am not a saint! I want to leave, not to have fun with this one here. This isn't fair! I'll run away! You'll see, I'll run away! Do you hear me? We hear you. Put on your pants first. A runner... Be patient! - They only feed us with promises... - Shut up, I'm sick of you. To Abakir Dzuraev from Merkul Dzuraev. This is from your Father, right? I remember now. You've left your rattle-toy at home? He's not an arrist. Dzuraev is a famous tractor driver. He set some kind of record. It's him alright. It's only they haven't thought of putting his picture in the local paper. No, I mean it. I read about him somewhere. I really did. Maybe in 'Crocodile', satyrical paper Well, yes, of course, in the paper! Dzuraev was the first in Kyrgyzstan to plough at high speed. On pre-war tractors, really? ??? Big numbers, little substance. - Where is he now? - Who knows. Maybe, he's gone to the city. To work at the factory. I don't know. Exactly. I once also knew a combine operator. She received a certificate of merit and moved to the city. And now she's a manager in a restaurant. Aldey, more tea! I see then. You want to become a manager. Thank you. A photovoltaic cell. What? A solar cell. On sattelites they transform sunrays into electricity. - They look like this drinking bowl. - Savant! Let's go, Kalipa. Go with them, Kemel. You'll work for Abakir. I need him like a hole in the head. Sadabek, take him instead of me. And I'll leave. I won't let you go before the tillage is over. Have him drive a water carrier. Well, you'll have to drive a water carrier. - What do you mean a water carrier? - Don't be stubborn. And you, put this on. But I've been sent here to work on a trailer. There's no other work in the unit. Leave if you like. Abakir! That tractor driver Kemel was talking about... could he be your relative? No. Saluting leading workers! Don't get upset. I had to bring water and to cook... And this is our little Eagle. - Do you know how to harness a horse? - Peace of cake. Will you show me? But of course I will! And our spring is over there, behind that hiil. Foreman! Here comes the water! What's wrong with you? There was a bucket here. You lost it. You scatterbrain. You're in trouble now. You'll go to court for idle time. Don't just stand there! Scoop water with your hands! Just a moment! Hey, boy! I'll fetch a bucket! Stop! You did this? Me? No. Now go to Abakir! Who's going to pay for idle time? We've been waiting for water for an hour. Oh, please don't! Abakir, this was less than an hour. Shut up. - Can I fill it? - Go ahead. What about flushing out hot water first? I forgot. I'm sorry. It's somewhere around here. We studied this at school. Not there. It's in the back. Here? Try and find it, savant. - Here? - Try harder. You studied this at school, huh? - Maybe here? - An you don't know how to flush an engine. Is this your idea of a joke? Where are you going? It's a tractor, not a water storage! Come back in about 2 hours! What should I do now? Sunbathe! Kemel! You're to treat us to some alcohol. Such are the rules. It didn't occur to me. It did to me though. You'll pay back from your salary. - Maybe, you shouldn't? Serve the table, Kalipa. Have a seat, savant. You have to treat the unit. That's how it works. To Anrakhai! Drink. You've worked a lot today, haven't you? Anrakhai is a hard nut to crack. A very hard one. Too hard for your baby teeth. It requires steel teeth. Don't worry, aksakal. I can crack it even with babyteeth. Steel teeth are just a denture. Just look at the savant one! Don't intimidate him, Abakir. - Our unit is a leading one. - You'll like it here. You just need to get used to it, and you'll start liking it. A leading one! You should know it, Kemel. Don't let us down! As a Komsomol member, you have to keep up. My old man has so many certificates of merit, we don't know where to put them! And I got some crepe de Chine as an award. It's with a flower pattern. Enough already! Have you seen our radio? Abakir got it for high performance. He received it on the stage. And then he handed it over to the unit, for everyone to use. Oh yes, exactly! The radio! It's top notch! What a wonderful radio that is! It's simply suberb! Here! Have a look! It's smooth! It's brand new! It's polished! The only thing is - it doesn't work. They forgot to install the electricity in Anrakhai. But it's battery-powered. All you need to do is check the contacts. So it might even work one day? Yeah, Abakir, you messed up Abakir, give me your singlets! To Dzuraev, the best tractor driver. Abakir... You wanted the rags. Hey you! Leave the rags! Stop weeping! Get to work! And don't meddle in other people's business next time! Know your place, squaw! You offended Kalipa. Very much! Listen, why are you blinking? I mean it! Well, since you mean it, then we'll talk. Follow me! What have you come here for? What? Why are you here? Because of money or because it's your call? - You already know it. - Say it again. I'm here to work. To work then? Do you know what is down there? Baikonur. The road to the space. They launch rockets there. Why don't you go there to work! One doesn't work in Anrakhai. In Anrakhai one slaves away and doesn't stick one's nose into other people's business. Got it? No. We're people, not cattle. If we slave away, as you say, then we do it for a purpose. For what purpose? To make life on earth better. What fine words! "People and not cattle." You really believe in this crap? Here's my advice. Trust only your own hands and eyes. Take a look around. Look at this dead land. Do you know why we're ploughing this dust? To prove to our posterity that in this place cannot grow even lucerne. You just don't understand. Tractor's idle again. I'm really sorry. I'm a bit late. Late? You were with a missy! - Abakir! - What? Why are you like this? Why can't you treat people properly? That was good. Everyone respects you for your work. You are brilliant at work. But you treat people like landlords used to! And now fill it. No. - I won't do it. - What did you say? I won't fill it for you! You will. I'll do it, Ab... - Pick up the bucket and fill it! - Abakir! - I will... - You won't do me anything. Kalipa... You're not asleep? Me neither. Do you hear this? The wind is howling. Those are wolves. It's scary. How nice it is that you called me. Always call me, my darling. You're handsome. You're so strong. so confident. The moon is so big today. Autumn is coming. Abakir. Do you love me? I love you so much. Do you understand? I ... respect you. Enough already... Everyone respects you: Sadabek, Dzhumash and even Kemel. He's a nice boy, don't hurt him. Dzhumash... I used to have a whole unit of men like him. I gave them a start in life. And then, imagine, I fell out of favour. They said I got on my high horse. They wanted educated people. - Off with Abakir! - Everything'll be as before. You'll see. Kalipa... What was before, will never happen again. Everything will be all right. And in winter, we'll go to the city, okay? Don't take offence at Kemel. Let's all be friends. He'll apologize, you'll see. And you can teach him to drive a tractor. He doesn't understand a damn thing, an oaf. Go to sleep. Yes, cry. It's all your fault. You indulge him. It's Sadabek's fault too. Indulges him by an old habit. I'd make him knuckle under, I'd take him down a peg or two. And look what you're doing, Kalipa! He'll leave you as he left his previous family. No. He loves me, don't you understand? And we'll get married. Get married? And you believe him? Do you think that's what he wants? Leave me alone! I want to know why I can't work at high speed. Because I hate deception! - There would be a lot of hectares. - So what? The depth of ploughing is too low. You're ploughing nothing but thorns. So the depth is too low then? Do you think otherwise wheat would grow in this dust? - It would. - Really? It won't now. But it will as soon as there's water here. I don't see any water here! It's all bullcrap! Try and get it. - There's nothing but sand and stones around. - Your way of thinking is erroneous. So you're a lover of truth now? Why don't you try ploughing instead of arguing? You were the first one to praise me when I set records at high speed. Don't you dare reproach me for that, Abakir. Yes, I did praise you. That's because I believed in you. They told me, "Be proud, Sadabek, you're following Abakir Dzuraev himself." So I followed you, and I saw nothing but your back. But now that you've been pushed aside, I see a thing or two. What do you see - steppe, weeds, thorns? Yes, steppe. But as far as the eye can see. As far as the eye can see? Have you got those fine words from that milksop? Why don't you start composing songs? When will you understand, our land is not just Anrakhai. There will be no harvest here anyway. But we can at least set the record. Then others will follow our example. They will emulate us. People are like sheep. A billy goat stands - the flock stand. It runs - they run. And so will you! Sheep follow a billy goat even to the slaughterhouse. Try leading Kemel. Will he follow? Sadabek! Help me to remove the cauldron from the fire. This Kemel again... Well? - Have nothing to say? - Enough, two of you! What idiot puts stuff in the way? It looks like our milksop has run away. - And left all his stuff. - Just wait. Alright then. - Turn off the light. - I'm reading. Turn it off. Here, take some bread. And we thought you got lost. We were going to start looking for you. Stop messing around. It's time to go to bed. Did you hear what I said? Abakir. Turn off the light. Are you deaf? I see, you're gving some light for the savant. His Majesty couldn't undress without light. - Abakir. - Shut up! I have the right to rest after a hard day's work! - I'm reading, by the way. - What did you say? I don't give a damn about your reading. Why are you standing there? No need to turn it off. I'll dim it. Don't. Then get undressed like this brat! Get undressed by the light. Don't pay attention. He's just joking. Am I? I said it's night. It means there will be night by the light. Get undressed! Do you hear me? Abakir, don't. - You shouldn't do it. - You'll be sorry! But I can't. Oh, you'll learn. You should be ashamed, Abakir! Don't! Let the savants read. And we, non-savants, will sleep. Get undressed. I'm waiting. Abakir, please... - Please, don't. - I said it's night! And it will be night! Abakir, I can't! I can't for the life of me! I can't! Please, don't... Going against me? I'll show you. Don't even come to me. Kemel! Kemel! Kemel! Where are you from? From agricultural hydraulics company. Hey, jerboa! How did you get here? Petka, congraturations on your foundling! So it's a boy! I thought it was a girl. What are you doing here? We're just going to and fro, dozens of times. Then there will be a sea here. - A sea? - Yes. A water reservoir. We're making underground waters rise. Give up at once. This guy will persuade anyone. He's already persuaded me. Are you serious about that? We need people very much here. Let's go then? We're not going there yet. On the way back. We're in transit. Understand? Old fart! Floor it! Otherwise, Kosymov will get to Marusya before you! - What's wrong? - It's the highway. Anrakhai ends here. Sheyshen! Fetch the flat cakes! Hello there! Just in time for the supper. Come on, help me. - Here you are. - Take it. Careful. Well? You know, they are making underground waters rise already. Soon, there will be water in Anrakhai. That's great. That means we won't need a water carrier then. I won't work on a water carrier any more. Give me a trailer. Like it says in my documents. Sadabek, let him replace me. - And I will leave. - I won't let you go. What about Kalipa? I'll work on a water carrier. What do you say, Abakir? Me, I don't care who'll be trailing behind. Here comes a pike Riding a bike. Followed by a cat - all black - On a scooter front-to-back. Next, five mosquitoes come into sight, Flying along on a yellow kite. Then arrives Mousie Mollie On a limping, smiling collie. And a strork astride a mare, And a bear in a wheel-chair. A frog does a funny trick... Who's that coming round that hill? A fierce and dreadful Roach! "Don't you dare to approach!" He roars, he rages. "I'll lock you in cages And swallow you all Like one tiny meatball!" Look! Abakir has gone mad. What is it, Abakir? Tired? What did you say? Fool. There was a turtle. I thought you were tired. Can I ask you a little question, comrade Dzuraev? Your records, have you set them with the same shortcomings? With such thorns, no one would do better. There used to be a special unit to burn weeds for me. - And then I came at high speed. - Why aren't they here now? No one cares about it. Kalipa. It's late. And the food got cold. And where is Kemel? I'm not his babysitter. Why are you like this, Abakir? You've become like a devil yourself, and you want to drive the kid to the grave. One couldn't drive someone like him to the grave. You're here. Listen, Abakir, what was that race you organized? Am I fulfilling the plan? Of course. It's almost a record. Then congratulate me and bug off. Why are you harass the boy? No matter how I bend over backwards, I never get a kind word from you. Are you tired? I've grown old. Abakir, look - there's a glow! The milksop's burning the weeds. How beautiful! Kemel! Kemel! Kemel! You've burnt all the cut thorns. Just look at the lines! That's alright. That means we'll plough over the ashes today. That's great, isn't it? You and Abakir will get on better. He's kind. All you need to do is listen to what he's saying. And don't argue. Listen, why don't we try going over the ashes? But he will kill me. You don't know Abakir! Get up! Do you want me to teach you? I know how to do it. Whatever will be, will be! Look. Who is it? Kemel. Floor it! Abakir, don't get angry. It's me who let him. Good-for-nothing! Abakir! Abakir! Kemel! It's Moscow! ... In the struggle you have lost... It started working. ... the worst thing is the inertia of style... Battery-powered! It's a habit, but it seems like feelings. It's a finished work, but there's no relief. Superb. It's great. It's a changed you... - Our Asan writes poetry too. - Listen, Aldey. You strive for truth, but you lie like a fraud. I'm sick of this noise. It's not wings any more - it's nothing but feathers. Turn it off. It gives me headache. ... you're afraid of unbelief. Style is courage to admit truth to yourself! Turn it off! Lose everything, but not fall into illusions. Why? ... feel oneself to be oneself only... Even if your life has turned out to be empty... Kalipa, turn off the radio. Recognition of the end is also a possibility of the beginning. He who admits a defeat is not beaten. The worst thing is the inertia of style. Enough. Now, here is what, foreman - as long as he's here, I won't work. It's time to rush with the plan, But I will... not work. It's your decision. What's gotten into you? But this is... - What if... - Sadabek! I'll be working on a trailer with Abakir, and you and Kemel will somehow... - What do you say? - No, foreman. It's not a solution. It's either me or him. Do you understand the situation? Do you fully understand it? What will happen if I leave? Why aren't you saying anything? Make your decision, foreman. It's you who'll stay with them. Sadabek, I won't - go anywhere from here. - And I'm not letting you go. Winter is coming, we have plenty of work to do, and you two... Enough, foreman. I got it. Kalipa, give me my backpack. Well? I'll do it myself. It's your fault. You hear me? It's all your fault! What are you staring at? Do you realize what you have done with your constant arguing? Go away! Get out of here! Where is Abakir? Bring Abakir back to me! Do you hear me? Go and bring him back! I can't live without him, don't you understand? He has to be here! Here! Here! The End
