The Salvation Army performed today at the Carabingy shopping complex, much to the delight of the shoppers present. Our cameras were there and this report was filed by Ferdinand Boland. - Oh, yuck! Hannibal. Mongrel. - [Ferdinand] 85-year-old band leader Richard Flemings will lead the band in the first lap around the car park. - Morning, platypus. What's all the yelling? - Dad, do you really have to feed your dog in the kitchen? - Oh, come on, hon. What am I supposed to do? You know he won't eat it if I put it outside. - He will, if he gets hungry enough. - You just have to watch where you're walking. - Oh, yeah, sure. - I hope that's not breakfast. - It's healthy. Fruit and nut. - Scramble yourself some eggs, or something decent. - Haven't got time. I'll get something on the way to school. (upbeat rock music) (Alex claps) Dad, do you have to do that? - What? - [Gail] Act as though you like that music. - Oh, I do. Why, don't you? - [Gail] That's not the point.

(Gail giggles) - Now, before we get up too much speed, I told Tracy we'd give her a lift to school. If we can fit her in.

Can I borrow your history assignment? - What for? - Oh, I was gonna get up early and do mine, but I was too whacked. I won't copy it word for word. I just need a few ideas. - Sure. For what it's worth, mine was a bit of a rush job, too. - Thank you. - So what else is new? - Do you have to drive like we're in the Indianapolis 500? I'm trying to write here, Matt. - Sorry, Trace. (Gail chuckles) (men hum melodically) (background chatter) - Everyone's assignments in? Okay, settle down. Let's get on with it. (hushed chatter) - And then when he turned around, he was just this awful skull face. - I thought today we might take a look at the social and economic conditions in Europe which led to the creation of the first penal colony in Australia. - It pushed this crystal into my hand and then I woke up. - No wonder you didn't get much sleep. - [Tracy] No, it wasn't that. When I woke up, this was on my pillow. Exactly like in the dream. - That's crazy. - I know it's crazy, but it's there! - [Millhouse] Tracy, I think one person addressing the class at a time, don't you? And as I'm the teacher, it should probably be me. - Sorry, Mrs. Millhouse. - What've you got here anyway? - Nothing. It's just a crystal. (ominous music) - Where'd you get this? - I sort of found it. - May I ask where? - It just kind of turned up. - That crystal is a Kadaicha stone. - And what's that? - In many aboriginal tribes, it was the equivalent of pointing the bone. The Kadaicha man was a tribal magician. If he gave you one of these, it meant you'd broken tribal law and were condemned to die. - Die? - Yes, but I wouldn't worry. It's only if it were handed to you by the Kadaicha man himself. - [Tony] Ah, looks like you better watch yourself, Trace. - You think it's funny? You have it. (Tony moans dramatically) - The American War of Independence. - [Deb] Hey, come on. It's just some dumb stone. - Yeah, probably one of your brothers put it on your pillow as a joke. - But what about the dream? - Well, maybe you half woke and saw it and that started you dreaming about it. - [Deb] Right, I bet that's it. - Maybe. - [Millhouse] So there was fear of French colonization... (upbeat rock music) (muffled pants and moans) - [Tracy] Oh, my god! Look at the time! Mom's gonna kill me! - She won't! - She will. - Oh, well. At least you'll die happy.

(ominous tones) (crickets chirp) I heard a scream. I thought it was my daughter. - [Officer] Which one's your daughter? - That's her over there. Anyway, she said it came from over here in the park. - Maybe we should go back to the house. - Police will want to ask us questions. - Well, we can't tell them anything. - [Officer Over Radio] Copy that. Stand by. - Hey. Don't touch anything. You could be disturbing evidence. What is that, anyway? - A Kadaicha stone. - A what? - It's just something she found. She had it at school today. - Well, leave it here. Collect it with her things later. (Gail sobs) (dark didgeridoo music) (switch clicks) (switch clicks) - [Radio Host] Six AM, news time. (brooding electronic jingle) Police investigations continue this morning into last night's savage slaying of a teenage schoolgirl. The girl's mutilated body was found early last night in an area of parkland in the northern beach-side suburb of Kangaloola. Gordon Trim takes up the story. - [Gordon] Police are at this stage giving out little information as to the cause of death. Witnesses say the girl appeared to have been attacked by some large animal. (Hannibal barks) (Gail sighs) - Hannibal! God sake, do you have to scare me to death? - [Gordon] While the suburb where the attack occurred is adjacent to large tracks of bushland, it is unlikely that dingoes or other wild dogs would be inhabiting the area. A spokesman said the ferocity of the attack was far beyond anything that might be expected from an animal of this kind. Circuses and zoos are being contacted to establish if any large animals may have gone missing during the night. (distant birds tweet) - I told her she shouldn't go through the park on her own. If she'd waited a few minutes, Dad would've given her a lift home! - Cops say it was some sort of animal. Was there any who'd do that? - That dream she told us about, remember? And that stone. - You're not saying someone put a hex on her? - Hey, come on, mate. - That's crazy. - Yeah, I know, but it just seems like an awful coincidence. - What was that about a stone? - Oh, it's just this thing that Tracy found in her bed yesterday morning. Mrs. Millhouse said it was aboriginal. - Oh. Well, um... Was it anything like this? (ominous tones) - Where did you get that? (bell rings) (knocks) - Oh, come in. Gail, Felicity. Look, I'm really sorry about what happened to Tracy. I know she was a friend of yours. - We were wondering if you could tell us anything more about that crystal that she had in class yesterday. - You said it was a Kadaicha stone or something. - Whatever terrible thing happened to Tracy was certainly nothing to do with that. - But it's really weird how it just sort of turned up out of nowhere and now Franky Boland's got one. He had a nightmare last night, too, but he can't remember what it was about. - Look, the stones aren't such a mystery. Not when you consider where you live. - [Gail] How do you mean? - Well, your street is the site of an old aboriginal burial ground. There was quite a protest about it a couple of years ago when the area was being developed. I was involved in it myself, actually. I'm surprised you didn't know, because your father's company was the developer. - No, he's never mentioned it. - Anyway, that's the reason why aboriginal relics turn up from time to time. There's really no mystery about it at all. - Look, are you sure it was a wild animal? It could have been some maniac who deliberately made it look that way. Christ, there's not a wild dog within 100 miles of here. - [Man On Phone] Oh, fuck it, Alex. Forensic confirmed traces of wild dog saliva in the throat wound. Up until last night, I would've agreed with you. Seems like we'd both be wrong. - Oh, shit. I'm about to launch a promotion for the second stage of the area development. All I need now is a wild dog scare. Look, will you let me know what's happening as soon as possible? - We're doing out best. - Yes, mate. Yeah, thanks a lot. I'll talk to you later, bye. (phone clacks) - [Shelly] Mr. Sorenson, your daughter is here to see you. - Okay. Hi, hon. How was your day? - Okay. Everyone's pretty down about Tracy. - Yeah. You holding up all right? - Yes. - Good. - [Shelly] Mr. Sorenson, sorry to interrupt you... (ominous music) Is there any more news we can give them? - No, not at the moment, Shelly. Thank you. - [Gail] You never told me we were living on an old aboriginal burial ground. - You never told me you were interested. - Mrs. Hillhouse, at school, she said a lot of people protested about it, when you built the neighborhood. - Oh, we had the standard hassles with a few land riders and greenies. Nothing serious. - But our street is on burial ground? - I doubt it. If you take notice of that crowd, every piece of dirt in the whole country's a sacred site of some kind. Why are you asking? (Matt mumbles melodically) - So, how did it go? - He dodged the question. Which means it's probably true. - So, where to now? - Let's go home for a while. (somber electronic music) - [Tracy] Friday night after the dance, we'll go somewhere. I promise. - [Tony] I can't wait that long. I could be dead by then. - [Tracy] Well, so could I, if we don't get home quick. Come on. - I'm serious. (upbeat rock music) (Gail laughs) - Oh, I'm sorry! Am I keeping you from something? - No. (laughs) When's your father getting home? - Late! He's off somewhere with his newest bit of jail bait. (both laugh) Oh, she's all right, actually. Except, she's not much older than me. (chuckles) (Matt mumbles) It's all right for you! It's not your father off making a fool of himself. - Well, how about I give you a shoulder job? (Gail grunts) (grunts) (Gail giggles) (phone rings) - Oh, go away! We don't want any! (phone rings) (both laugh) Hello. - Gail, it's Fizz. - Hi, what's up? - I've been looking through old newspapers in the school library and I think you should come and see what I found. - What, now? - Yeah! It's about what Mrs. Millhouse was saying today. (muffled chatter from phone) - Okay, on our way. (phone clacks) - What? (phone clacks) (footsteps clack) (suspenseful music) (footsteps clack) (dark didgeridoo music) (birds tweet and chirp) (Fizz gasps) (clocks chime) - Place is like a tomb. - Yes. (suspenseful music) Fizz? - These must be the articles she was talking about. - "A conservationist spokesman today described as 'mindless desecration', the siting of an exclusive new residential area upon land claimed by local aborigines to be sacred." - Hey, check this. "Future residents of the exclusive Kangaloola development area will live under the shadow of an ancient curse according to full-blood aborigine Billinudgel. - [Fizz] What do you think? - [Matt] Sneak up on us, why don't you? - [Gail] I was worried about you. - What do you think? - Most of it's what Mrs. Millhouse has already told us. - She didn't tell us there's supposed to be some curse on the neighborhood. - Well, you don't take all that stuff seriously, do you? - Well, no. What if someone wants us to? - How do you mean? - Well, I don't know. Maybe somebody wants to make it look like there really is a curse. - I don't see why they should. - Well, couldn't your father have some business enemies? What about that old aborigine? What if he's some sort of nutcase? Sneaked into Tracy's house, left that crystal, and then killed her the next night? - It all sounds a bit way out, really. Maybe we should just wait and see what the police come up with. - Hi, guys. I thought I'd have the place to myself. - [Matt] Oh, no problem. We're outta here. - Going to be long? They'll be locking up anytime. - No, no. It's okay, I got a key from Mr. Hollace. I'm doing some research for my history project. I'll be here for hours. - Well, goodnight. - Bye. - The, uh, rude magazines are on the top shelf at the back. - What? - Don't leave any stains on the centerfolds. (Franky chuckles) - (clears throat) Do my best. - Okay. See you later, mate. (footsteps recede) (crickets chirp) (dark electronic music) - I'll tell you one thing. If I was Franky and I'd found one of those crystals on my pillow this morning, no way I'd be staying back in that empty school by myself at night. - Yeah, I know. (engine revs) (ominous didgeridoo music) I'll see you in the morning. - Thanks for the ride. - Pleasure. (car door slams) Don't lie awake all night worrying about curses, eh? - Goodnight. - Night. (engine roars) - This thing has got you really freaked, hasn't it? - Well, I don't know how you can be so cool about it. You even saw the body. - I'm not cool, Fizz. It's just there's no sense in getting into a wild panic about it. - Well, I hope you're right. I'll see you tomorrow. (footsteps clack) (Hannibal barks) - Bye. Hannibal! (Hannibal barks) Quiet! It's only me. (Hannibal barks) Hannibal, settle down! What's the matter? (Hannibal growls) - Your father home, missy? I talk to him. The street you live in, very bad place. You leave, everybody leave. If you stay, more young white fella die. - You were the one in that photo in the old newspaper. - Tell your father what Billinudgel say. I tell him before, but he say I'm silly ol' black fella. But now, maybe he'll listen! (Hannibal growls) - Wait! (Hannibal barks) (suspenseful didgeridoo music) (eerie dissonant music) (Franky groans) (dramatic music) (clattering) (Franky coughs) (Franky moans) (Franky grunts) - Mr. Hollace!

I had this real composer's block, you know? I thought we were gonna have to get up and play at the dance with no new material and then suddenly I come up with three- - I don't have time. You can play them for me tonight. Hey, Fizzy, what's happened? (somber electronic music) - What's going on? - Gail, Felicity? Can I speak to you for a moment, in here? (door closes) - [Gail] Mrs. Millhouse, what's happened? - They can't be sure what it was until after a post-mortem, but he was bitten by something. The police doctor thinks it was a funnel-web spider. - Franky? - A post-mortem? - I'm afraid so. I'm sorry. Look, I wanted to speak to you, because of what you said yesterday about the Kadaicha stone. I think you said Franky found one. - He did. So did Tracy. - People are going to get very upset about what's happened, understandably, they'll be looking for an explanation. As I told you yesterday, when this area was being developed, there was a lot of protests, quite a few aborigines were involved and there was a lot of ill-feeling at the time. - Mrs. Millhouse, it's no coincidence. There's something going on and those crystals are part of it. There was an old black man who came to our house last night. He said more people were going to die. - Billinudgel? He wouldn't have meant that as a threat. The aborigines believe this land has some sort of a curse on it. They're trying to do the right thing and warn us of what they think is a danger, but I know them. They wouldn't hurt anyone. - Mrs. Millhouse! - Now, listen. Early last century, a group of young black people, they'd have been about your age, were attacked by a gang of bush rangers. They were all killed. The girls were raped first. When the tribe found the bodies, they had no way of knowing who was responsible, so they buried them on sacred ground, where your street is now, and then in understandable anger, they attacked a nearby white settlement. The next day, whites from all over the country banded together in an armed hunting party, probably including the bush rangers who'd started the trouble in the first place. They hunted the tribe down and shot dead every last man, woman and child. Now, if people were to get the idea that aborigines were responsible for what happened to Franky and Tracy, then we'd have history repeating itself. That's why I want you to be careful what you say. - Someone has to find out what's going on. Because I don't want to be the next. - Where'd you get that? - On my pillow, last night. Just like the others. I had that same dream, too. - What do you think of all that? - (chuckles) I was hoping you weren't going to ask. - I suppose, hypothetically, it's possible someone could train a wild dog to kill. But a funnel-web? (distant waves crash) (birds squawk) - I see your guardian angels are still with us. - Every time I came out of class today, they were in the corridor, waiting. I feel like a real dork. That's it. - What? - The tunnel. The one I dreamed about. (waves crash) - Fizz, it's just a storm water drain! I know. My father's company built all this. It's a tunnel. Fizz! (eerie music) - Now where the fuck do they think they're going? - [Fizz] I thought I could see figures moving, but then when I really looked, there was never anything there. - [Shane] Uh, let's get outta here. - [Gail] There's a T junction up ahead. - We've come to the end. (eerie music) (water trickles and drips) - I came up to this wall. And then somehow I was in a cave with a fire and aboriginal paintings. (waves crash) - Listen, I vote we get our minds off all this. Let's go down the river for a swim. - Sounds good to me. - All right but we have to go home first and get some gear. - Why? Are you getting shy in your old age? - No, I just don't want to get arrested. We've got an escort, remember? - Oh, yeah. (suspenseful music) (muffled police radio chatter) (upbeat acoustic music) - Woo! - Think that's one of 'em getting killed or what? (both chuckle) ♪ When we wake up, wake up in the mornin' ♪ - Yeah! ♪ We know another great day has begun ♪ ♪ The sun is shining, happiness is calling ♪ ♪ Look out, world, we're gonna have some fun ♪ (girls cheer and giggle) - [Gail] Are you going to do them tomorrow night? - Yeah, if we get it together in time. - [Gail] Let's go in. - We come out for a swim. So let's go. - I think I'll give it a miss. (water splashes) (Gail yelps) - Come on. A swim will be great. - No, Shane, I don't want to. - It will, come on. - [Fizz] No! (water splashes) - [Gail] Oh, it's gorgeous! (Fizz giggles) - Come on. (Fuzz giggles) Let's go. Swimming.

I shall put a stop to his little game. I'm coming down after you, red beast! (Fizz screams) - Oh, Shane! Stop it! (giggles) - Hi, guys! - Aww! (giggling) - Somebody call?

(water splashes) (ominous music) What the hell happened? - I don't know. Something took her. - What kind of something? - I don't know! I couldn't see! - [Officer] Just tell me what you saw. - [Matt] I told you, I couldn't see a thing! - [Officer] Listen, Elvis, can we get a grip on this? - [Matt] Don't insult me, you useless pig! She's fucking gone! Don't just stand there, do something about it! - [Officer] Just tell me what you saw, fuck-wit! - [Matt] Why don't you go and do something bloody constructive? - [Officer] I'll reconstruct your face in a minute, if you don't shut up! (water splashes) - You said something took her. What kind of something? - All I could see was something black and... Looked like a snake or an octopus or something. (suspenseful music) - Snake or octopus? Is that what it looked like to you? - It could've been anything, the water was so cloudy. - [Rose] If the water was cloudy, how can you tell if there was anything there? She could've got into difficulties, been caught in the current. - She was a good swimmer! Something dragged her under, against the current. - Gail! Are you all right? (suspenseful music) - [Officer] Found her! - Shit. - Think I'm gonna throw up. (water swashes) - What was that? - What? - Don't you see it? - Well, what then? - It's either the Loch Ness Monster, or the biggest fucking eel I've ever seen in my life. (ominous music) - A dog savage enough to kill a teenage girl, and a spider with the fastest-acting venom in history, and now a giant eel that thinks it's a boa constrictor. What the hell is going on? (somber string music) (door closes) (distant laughter) (water trickles) (water trickles) (eerie music) - No! (mirror cracks) (phone keypad bleeps) (eerie music) (hammering thuds) - [Matt] Are you sure about this? - No. That's why we're doing it. This is it. Exactly what I dreamed. The thing was here, dancing and chanting something. - [Matt] This is weird. - Oh! - Is that what you saw? - Sort of, except it was alive. Well, we know one thing. It was no ordinary dream. Let's get out of here. - You've got my vote. (eerie music) (Gail screams) - Right. Just what do you two think you're doing here? - What on earth did you think you were doing? - Proving to myself I'm not going mad. That cave, it's the one we've all been dreaming about. It's got something to do with the killings. - Come on, hon. Listen to yourself. I know you're upset about your friends. It's only natural. - I'm more than upset, Dad. I'm terrified. Everyone who had that dream and got one of those crystals has been killed and I'm next! - Come on, hon, now take it easy. No one's going to hurt you. It's just been some horrible series of freak accidents. - Like hell it is! Whatever killed them is tied up somehow with what's in that cave! - That's rubbish. It's got nothing to do with the cave! - We think it has, Mr. Sorenson. - Look, you've done enough tonight, dragging Gail out on this senseless escapade. - He didn't! It was my idea. We want to know about the cave. - There's nothing to know. - No one even knows it's there, do they? - [Alex] What are you talking about? - There is no way the authorities would've let you build a supermarket over something like that! - Well it just goes to show what you know, son, doesn't it? The whole thing had full departmental approval. - Well, we can find out easily enough tomorrow. I'll phone the Heritage Commission and ask! - (clears throat) I better get back to my rounds. - Yeah, sorry. Thanks for calling me. Night. - Night. - Well? Do we do that? Phone the Heritage Commission? Or are you going to tell us the truth? - A work crew found the cave when they were excavating the foundations. If it had got out, it would've been ruinous. We were already having enough problems with protestors. It would've meant canceling the whole shopping complex, and that would've meant redesigning the entire subdivision. So, we kept quiet and built around it. Well, what purpose is it going to serve now, going public on it? I mean, they're hardly gonna rip down a complex of that size, are they? - I wanna talk to that old man who came to the house last night. The aborigine. I want to talk to him. Where does he live? - How should I know? - You can find out. - Gail, you're being stupid. Just forget it, huh? - I want to talk to him, or I'll tell him about the cave. - Gail, I'm your father. How dare you. - Dad, I don't want to, but I don't want to be killed, either! That old man is the only one who can maybe tell us what's happening. - Gail, he's nothing but a crazy old man. And he's put enough wild ideas inside your head already. He's not at the address we had on file. The police went looking for him today and he's gone. - [Gail] Maybe they didn't look hard enough. They don't have my motivation, do they? I want that address, Dad. (ominous music) (Tracy screams) (Fizz screams) (muffled lively chatter) - Ah, Mr. Fitzgerald, I heard you've made a decision about the dance tonight. I think most of us assumed it would be canceled. - I've given it a lot of thought, and I've spoken to a number of staff and students. The feeling is that we pay tribute at morning assembly to the three young people we've lost so tragically and, uh, just go ahead with the dance as a sort of an affirmation that life goes on. - And that's the final decision, is it? - Yes. - Have the police found anything yet? A connection between those crystals and the deaths? - I don't imagine for a minute they will. All this stuff about death stones and curses... It's the beginning of mass hysteria. Which is why I believe it's all the more important we go ahead with the dance as scheduled, just... Give them something else to think about. Excuse me. - [Man On Phone] Apart from the fucking stones, we've found nothing at all to connect the three deaths, and they're hardly what you'd call concrete evidence, are they? - Wish you'd tell my daughter that. She's got onto some story about an aboriginal death curse and she's worried she's his next victim. - [Man On Phone] Oh, come on, Alex. Why should she think that? - Something about a dream and finding one of those crystals in her room. - [Man On Phone] Oh, yeah? Where is she now? - Well, she and her boyfriend went looking for that old fool bloke, Billinudgel. She thinks he might know something. Why? (eerie music) (birds tweet) (brakes squeak) (knocks) - We're looking for an old man named Billinudgel. Does he live here? Please. It means a lot. - Do you think like the police? That me grandfather's been killing all those white kids? - No, I don't think that, but I do think that he knows something about it. - Please, you must have some idea where he is. - Sorry, I can't help ya. - Okay. (eerie music) - Look, if you like, come back tomorrow! He might be back then. - By tomorrow, somebody else might be dead. - Well, wait a minute! (eerie music) (birds chirp and squawk) It's not the cops. It's just a couple of kids. I reckon they're pretty scared. Wouldn't hurt you to talk to them. - [Gail] What can I do? - Kadaicha man dead. Been dead for 100 years. But he got strong power. Once you've got the stone, it's too late. Wherever you go, Kadaicha spirit follow you. The Kadaicha make themself animals. Spider, fish, anything you like! Story says when Kadaicha alive, very bad man. Even his own tribe! - But why kill just us teenagers? We're not the ones who built the houses round here. - I think I know. Those aborigines the bush rangers killed. They were round our age. It's their graveyard we're living on. Someone's idea of an eye for an eye. - Jungy. Help them. (suspenseful music) - [Billinudgel] Maybe this help you. - [Gail] What is it? - Spirit stone. Take away strength! Maybe send away. But Kadaicha never dead. - What if it doesn't work? (ominous music) (car door slams) - Miss Sorenson, everything all right? - Yes. - You talk to the old man? - No, he's not here. - I told you yesterday, don't know when he'll be back. - Uh-huh. (car doors slam) (car starts) (engine roars) (suspenseful music) - You know, that was cops outside. Wanted to know if you were here. Well, she told them no. (birds tweet and chirp) - Hey, come on. Everything's gonna be okay. I know it. You know, I still reckon the best thing to do is just to get into my car and drive. Stay right away from here until it's all sorted out. - You heard what he said. It'll just come after me. - Hi, hon. Matt. The police told me you were here. You okay? - Dad, the fact that you've built part of this neighborhood on an aboriginal burial ground doesn't worry you, does it? - Not again, Gail. - There's a death curse and I'm on the hit list. (birds tweet and chirp) - [Billinudgel] You gonna sulk all day? - I'm not sulking. None of my business if you wanna let that kid get herself killed.

(somber electronic music) - [Radio Host] The exclusive beach-side suburb of Kangaloola lakes, still reeling from a series of tragedies which has claimed the lives of three local teenagers, is this morning coming to terms with more bad news. The residents of an entire street may need to be relocated following the discovery of severe stress fractures in the underlying sandstone. A spokesman for Sorenson Developments said the fracturing had not been detected at the time of construction. The condition, he said, was strictly localized, and other streets in the area should not be affected. (radio buzzes) - Hey, did you hear something? - Come on, mate. It's bloody cold in here.
