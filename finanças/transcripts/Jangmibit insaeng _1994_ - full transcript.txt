LA VIE EN ROSE 413-5949 Yellow Submarine On April 13th, an accident happened with the organization Hide and wait 413-5949 Yellow Submarine for further instructions. 413-5949 Yellow Submarine President Chun said he would hand over the reigns next year concluding that the revision of the constitution is impossible for the moment. This special statement has been taken place out of consideration for a peaceful transfer before the coming of the Seoul Olympics. Looks like we'll have some street demonstrations again. It's got nothing to do with laborers like us. We won't have much work if the nation is not peaceful. But they still need us to build the houses they live in. Be quiet please. We're watching TV. Time for midnight charge. Can I stay overnight? Yes, you can... Only if you pay the fee. Gee, can't we skip one night? No joking. It's not funny. You look pretty nowadays. You found a lover? Haven't you get a grip yet? I don't like that kind of jokes. Hey, don't forget to pay. You dirty little rat! Go to the rest room for that. You are grating on my nerves. What? You need some tissue? He thinks he's in a hotel. Hey, mister. Get up. It's time to get out. Time to get out? You paid midnight charge and it's till 7 AM. Look around, you're the only one left. It's OK now. Is your brother doing well at school? Well, yes. He's always felt timid in your presence. He shouldn??t do any better than you. That's not true. You're going home tonight? Home? You know that tomorrow is father's memorial day. Oh, I forgot! Haven't you been home lately? I have no family of my own there, but you do. You're the loving son of your mother. I've been busy with my graduation exams. I couldn??t pay attention to others. Even though I'm not an educated woman I can see what's going on. I know what you're engaged in. - I'm doing nothing. - Don't disappoint us. Don't forget your mother's only hope is in you. Can I ask you a favor? What do you need that much money for? I need it for my family. Don't worry if it's too difficult. No, it's not! It should be ready by the end of the month. Thank you so much. You've always been helpful. Don't start again. By the way, are you interested in the man I mentioned to you before? Well... I'm not sure if I deserve such a chance. Let's just go for it. You can't waste your youth surrounded by those scamps. He's a nice guy. He owns two shops in Seoul. Why would such a man want a woman like me? Because you're a nice woman. You're still beautiful and capable. I would be attracted myself if I weren't married. Frankly speaking, he has a son from his first marriage. But he is divorced now and his son is a good boy. Since he's been married once he probably can't forget his first wife. Ms. Oh, three hero teas to Yang's shop. All right. Are you still mopping? No promotion yet? Dong-pal! How are you? People say you killed Double Axe? Is it true? I don't even know who he is. Panko said he wanted to fix someone and asked me to accompany him. And it's him who killed the guy. I didn't know you were so naive! The gangsters think you killed him. Panko intentionally framed you. He even has back-up supporters unlike you! Mee-young! Hi, Dong-pal! How have you been? Do you have some time? Long time no see! Sorry, I have another show. It's OK. I'll take a rain check. You heard from your brother? He rang me a few days ago. He asked me to tell you that he was in Yeoui-dong. He must have known you're coming to me. I got to go now. Come to Carnegie Club later. It's my last show there. - I'll buy you a drink. - Good bye. Bye. Mee-young! Yes? I enjoyed your show. You're too harsh on me. We are gambling now. That's what it's like. Now I know what you're like. What? What am I like? You should know what you're like. Are you gonna make me upset? In the army, you must have your strong point. But what do you have now? Except that hair on your chest! Come and take firing instructions at my shooting gallery. I made your friends ace shooters and they were all given bonus holidays. Go on! - Where did you get so drunk? - Sorry, Madam. We had a welcoming party. Let's have one here, too! - Oh! - Sing for your guests. - Why a welcoming party here? - Why not! Look at her, can't even stand. - Must have drunk a lot. - I said sing a song for us. Why don't you floor us with a song? Go ahead and sing. They're our guest after all. Alright! There she goes. Hello, I'm Lee. I'll start off with "A Lady from Soyang River". When the sun goes down on the Soyang River at a lonely field of reeds a cuckoo is weeping. Oh my innocent and sweet love! Let me come and feel you I miss you darling. I miss you. I'm a lady from Soyang River. - Encore! - Great! Let's go to work. You look too close. I'm getting jealous. - I like you better. - Come here then. Ms. Oh! Got any mineral drink? More? No more for you today. I need the energy to clean the mess. I'll be back soon. What're you writing all the time? Nothing. - Two hero teas, please - Yes. - It's your treat. - Really? How much is it? Not that expensive. Don't worry. Are you a fortune teller? No, I'm not. A writer then? No. Then what do you write about? It's just like a diary. She's a rose moss. A shiny rose moss decorating the flower garden. It glows with sad smile, and is humbly looking above. She delivers teas. Ms. Oh's pale body delivers hero teas... Dong-pal! Where's Panko? Well, that's... I know he's here. Where are you? Panko! Panko! Come out! Dong-pal! You killed our family member. You saucy scamp! Don't expect to walk out alive. Wait a moment! There must be some misunderstanding. I don't need your excuses. Shit! Calm down! Who's there? I want to pick up my bag. The shop is not open yet. I'm in a hurry. Let me take it. Wait a moment. Get your bag and leave. No, get away! Get out! Wait! Excuse me. Can I stay overnight? I have no money but I can work. Children are not allowed. I'll leave early in the morning. It's not a boarding house for runaway kids. Come over here, kid. You have no place to go? Madam, let the kid stay. I'll pay for him. Can you get me a bottle of alcohol? I got you, you little rat! You run away from home to come here? - Come with me! Now! - Forgive me, father. Stupid! Come here. Now! I'm sorry, father. Listen to me. Don't ever try to rip the runaway kids off. Shut up and learn to take care of your own kid properly! What? I'll report you to the police for having an illegal business. Listen, she's not to blame. I allowed him to stay. Who do you think you are, old man? You'd better watch your mouth. - What? - Sorry, sir. I admit we were careless. So you're the shop owner? - Let's go to the police. - I apologize, sir. He looked too miserable. We couldn??t refuse the poor boy. I was going to send him back tomorrow morning. Now that you admit I'll just tell you to be careful next time. Yes, I will. This is your taxi fare. It's late at night. - Take care. - Let's go, kid. Good bye. I should quit this god forsaken business. I was thinking of... What I did yesterday. Hey, Mr. Gangster. Let me make it clear. Nothing happened between us yesterday. You got it? Then leave me alone. Are you always like this? It was nothing unusual, huh? That's right. It meant nothing to you. I know your kind of people well. I know you thoroughly. You ignorant, dirty and mean bastard! Get lost! I won't charge you with rape. Damn it, you mean you've been screwing so many. Ms. Oh! I'm ready for you! What's wrong with her? Thank you for the clothes. It's my farewell present. I feel at home here. I don't want to leave. Do I look happy? I'm having enough problems with people who are like trash. Why are you talking like that? They are trying hard to survive. You don't know them. They'll never get any better than now. It's not their fault. That's why you came here? Because only you can fix the problem? I'm not asking you to go back to law school. But find a different way to live before it's too late. I don't want you to become like me. Korean-American relations will be as problematic as now. The two governments should try to build up more consolidated trust. Private companies should realize the potential importance of American market. They are talking rubbish! Hey, we were watching it. So what? You turn it on if you want. What? You're scared to pass by me? Think as you like. You arrogant snob! Why are you trying to provoke a fight? Because I don't like you. You bastard! Why do you hit him? Shit! Why are you cutting in? Is he your pimp or something? It's none of your business. Why don't you hit me now? Shit! Stick together and you'll live well! Have you seen Panko? Is he all right? He hasn't rung me recently. He's the only family I got. He didn't say much about recent situation. I didn't even get his number. Maybe he's got something brewing. He'll reach you sometime though. If you find out where he is, tell me, please. Then give me your phone number. Well, I'm not staying at one place. But I'll ring you every few days. Show time, Mee-young! Coming! Wait here. It'll just take 15 minutes. I'll buy you a drink tonight. Hey, Dong-pal! Did you know you were my first love? You despise me because I'm a showgirl? But you 're nothing but a penniless bum. Here we are. I live here. It's my home. Quite nice, huh? You have to stay with me tonight. Dong-pal! Are you running away? Dong-pal? Bastard! Dong-pal! - Good-bye. - Bye. Are you here to see if he and I live well? - You look fantastic! - Shut up! I don't understand why you're harassing me! Hey, Mr. Gangster! Don't you think we're too old for this? I just want to talk. I'm very busy today. Just stop following me. Don't you dare to come in! You're as beautiful as he said. You are attracted to her already. Say something, Madam Shin. Well... I heard you owned a business. Yes, a small comic book rental shop. I love comics. I used to spend all day at the comic book shop when I was a kid. I see. In such a shop, you deal with cash and no complicated problems. I usually get checks and after the cashing fee the profit isn't much. I don't know much about handling business. Terrific view out there! I feel so great. How was it? Are you going to follow me all day? Let me do my work. I won't interrupt you. You are, already. So, please go and do whatever you like. Hello. Madam Shin. You're dressed up beautifully today. - How are you? - I'm not fine. Every man around here is lovesick after you. You haven't been here for a while. I've been busy. You got any new comics? Hundreds of them every day! and quite a few of the popular cartoonists such as Lee Hyun-sai, Heo Young-man, Ko Hang-suk, Park Bong-sun and some pure Love story as well. Is he your husband? - You need a porter? - No, thank you. I can carry them. Recite the four promises you swore to keep. First, apologize to Kee-young for hitting him. Second, never scare people at the shop. Third, don't interfere with Madam's private life. Fourth... Fourth... Don't give me bedroom eyes. Today the meeting between USA and USSR begins at Moscow. Reporter Oh from Washington. The meeting will continue for three days from today covering the issues of construction, regional conflict and undercover agents at US Embassy. The two countries basically agree on European possession of the missiles but USA proclaims the quantitative reduction of nuclear missiles is needed. I'm sorry about yesterday. Are you happy now? Wait. - You look underage. - Why? Show me your ID Cards. Where can I buy it? Are you joking me? Shit! Madam. Aren't you tired of working alone? I think I can help you. I don't need any wages. Let me just stay here for free. I'll work hard. Hi, everybody! I'm Yu-jin, the new manager of Um-ji Comic Book Shop. Thank you for coming here. Tonight I'll present the new video programs. The first movie is Snake Fist starring Jackie Chan. This is an original Hong Kong movie with Jackie Chan's comic action. The second is DeIta Force starring Chuck Norris. It's a war movie. Norris learned martial arts during his army service in Korea. But he hasn't sent a thank you note to us yet. Just show us the movies! The third is the movie you've been looking forward most to seeing. The Frantic Madam Horse Part III. - That's great. - Right. It's the first time screening an erotic movie of Pink Production. A beautiful rich widow meets a young man at a desert inland and they have a fantastic, wild and very impressive love affair. Enjoy the movies! Thank you. - Great! - Wonderful! Nice presentation! And nice look as well. You should try to be an actor yourself. Mee-young, it's me. - Hello, Dong-pal. - Hi. Any news from Panko? Not yet. - Mee-young? - Yes? No, it's nothing. - Dong-pal. - Yes. You didn't look very well the other day. Take care of yourself wherever you are. All right. Good bye. I'll ring you again. OK. Bye! This is good for beginners. Story line is good and there's also lots of basic information about such novels. It's an introduction to martial art novels. If you look for brutality I'll recommend you another one. Also here is an erotic tale. What is your preference? I'll take this. - The introduction one? - Right. - Enjoy your reading. - Thank you. Get some sleep, Yu-jin. I'll take care for a while. Thanks. - Isn't the noodle ready yet? - Coming! - Shit! - I'm so sorry. You clumsy asshole! Where did you leave your eyes? - Careless idiot! - I'm so sorry, sir. - Shit! Clean it quick! - Here, this part. That's enough. He didn't do it on purpose. Who's this guy? Just shut up and don't make a fuss. There are other guests in here. Is that clear? Hey, stop it. - Are you all right? - Yes. Let's go play billiards. The demonstration of today has the possibility of stimulating the participation of pro-communists. The fugitives from last demonstration should also be watched for. The Headquarters of National Police proclaims a rigid measure of settlement. They will put this new measure in action to prevent student-activists from rioting again and for peaceful transfer of political power and successful Seoul Olympics. Thank you for last night. You're welcome. There's got to be some kind of rules for everybody. Let me introduce myself. I'm Yu-jin Choi, the manager of Um-ji Comic Book Shop I'm Dong-pal Hwang. Come join us, please! - I'm Yu-jin Choi. - Kee-young Kim. I think we've already met. Looks like an Um-ji board meeting. Hey! You want to play foot-volleyball with us? Dick! Do you want to die? Who ordered coffee? I did. Please sit down. - Sugar? - Two spoonfuls. - Cream? - Yes, please. Have some, Ms. Oh. - What I wrote was... - It's OK. What brings you here? We are here for an errand. Mom asked me to return the books. - These, too. - Good, girls. Here, good job. - Thank you. - Thank you. Bye. - Sorry for being delayed. - It's all right. - Have some coffee. - Come here. You don't seem the type to be working at a comic shop. There must be some reasons. I'm so bored. You're off tomorrow, Ms. Oh. - How nice! - Money for the gas bill please. Come back on Monday. Here's the money. Thanks a lot. Then leave soon. And never come back to this town. Ring me around Full Moon's Day. Let's go to father's grave. Father was looking for me desperately when I ran away from home. People always hurt each other. It's called living. I'm not angry with my father or your mother. But... But if... If you do anything stupid, Like getting yourself hurt or going to jail, I'll never forgive you. Understand? - It's beautiful day! - Indeed. It reminds me of my younger days. I sometimes used to get scared when I awoke alone in broad daylight... Did you have any similar experiences? Well... Where's your home? Sangdo-dong. It's not far from here. Why do you stay at the shop? Well, that's because I want to be a writer. I need lots of experiences to write good novels So you have to sleep in such a dirty place? Sure, I need to experience different kinds of people because a novel is about real lives. Some writers even go to the mine or sail on a ship for experience. This is nothing compared to what they do. But something less special can also be novelized. - For example... - Like what? For example, common emotions such as love, separation and longing... Haven't you experienced such things? I slept with Ms. Oh. Come on, tell me all about it. She first refused to do it. but once I began she enjoyed it very much! She said no, no at first, and then oh yes, yes! Yes! What a sly girl! Totality different from what she looks like. You can never trust a woman. Can you give me a chance with her? No way! Any girl I've had you can never get. Why not? - Can you please be quiet? - What? It's none of your business! You be quiet! Go away and do your own job. - Go! - Go away! Are you deaf? Want to learn a lesson? Enough! Stay out of this. He has started this time. I said "Enough"! Yes. I see. Thank you. Police patrol! Everyone, get out! Quick! You got any cigarettes? Let's go to have some fun. Don't worry. It's on me tonight. Cute, isn't it? Does it have a meaning? I tattooed it when I was expelled from high school. I thought one day it might bring me a rosy life. That might be the meaning... You still think so? Think what? That you might have a rosy life? You never know. How is business, Madam? Looks like it goes well! So-so. How's your family, officer? They're all right. Why don't we have a drink sometime? - Let's finish patrolling. - Yes, sir. Who's that guy? A new worker? He's a drunken guest. Really? - Hey! - Yes. Right. Don't touch me! This is my home! Let go of me! I said let go! Where's the dirty looking guy? What's up? What's the fuss! Where's the asshole who hit my boys? How would I know? Don't protect him. Is he your paid lover? Shut up! You hit me? Stop! It's my shop! Shit! - Start! - Stop it! Don't do this! This is my shop! Get out, you all! Stop it! Are you... In some kind of trouble? You always stay at the shop. The company I worked for laid me off. I'll go back to work when things get better. Maybe I'll get a new job. We've got go find out what happened first! Calm down for a minute. Let me go, you coward! I don't ask you to join me! That was too much. You didn't have to smash the whole store. They deserved it for sure. Stop there! Release them! We can make a new shop with this money. I don't need these anymore! I loathe them! I'm gonna close the shop! Leave if you want to. We're gonna stay. Oh, are you? It's my shop. I can close it if I want to. Don't behave like a child! We won't snatch the shop from you. Do whatever you like with your shop after we fix it. I learned this skill from my old man. You can warm up the floor with an electric blanket. Who ordered the noodles? Order what? Put it down here. I was writing martial art stories as a part time job. I wanted to write something unusual. So I wrote a story satirizing our political situation. I thought college students would love it. It was sold a lot and the publisher made money. They even gave me a bonus. But the book was listed as an anti-government publication. I'm not interested in terms like democracy or dictatorship. I never thought it had anything to do with my life. But suddenly I became a wanted-criminal Like radical students. Now I can't go home nor can read books, nor meet friends. I can't even write freely. Mr. Dong-pal Hwang! Mr. Dong-pal Hwang! You know Dal-shik Chung? Dal-shik Chung? Panko? He said you're on the run because you killed a man. Bastard! It was he who killed the man. I was only a lookout. You're in trouble, anyway. You could be charged of murder and spend 10 years in jail. Let me be honest with you. You know a guy called Kee-young staying at the shop? He's a very dangerous man. In other words, he's a communist to the core. There are a few things we want to know about him. If you help me about that I'll take care of you. Is this the same shop as before? Hey, come on in! Looks wonderful! You must've spent a fortune. Good evening. You've done a great job. He s going to buy you a drink. What for? I'm joining the army tomorrow so I want to say good bye and... Briefly speaking, he wants to apologize, and also congratulate you on the re-opening. Got it? Come on! Be real men! Have drink and shake hands. Madam, come with us. I should prepare for the opening ceremony. Have fun, you guys. OK. let's go. Come on. Let's go and have fun! - Mr. Rifle. - Yes? I'll give you a real treat if I'm out on a bonus holiday. Sounds great! Come back as a real man. Right! Bottoms up! - Hey, Mr. Manager. - Yes? You know Ms. Oh from the coffee shop. She has gone. Without leaving a word. Understand? She's got a sick husband. After she was found out to be a married woman she disappeared. Such a sleazy girl. You slept with her? I know you did. Jee-ho Min. I didn't expect to see you here. You met the wrong person. You were the labor activist, weren't you? I was your boss. Remember? Which factory are you planning to overthrow now? I should have put him in jail. Get up! Get up now! What sort of guy are you? Why are you hitting me? Jee-ho Min? Who's Jee-ho Min? None of your business. I don't like snobbish intellectuals like you. You're garbage! Why did you come to the shop? What about you? Just answer me! Why did you come here? It's my sister's place. What did you say? Madam is my sister. How come I ended up in this mess? I hate you all! Bastards! You're leaving with Jee-ho? Look over there. The shabby houses and those who barely live. I hated this town so much that I wanted to leave all the time. Now I'm left alone and everyone is going. But I won't leave. I'll stay here with the poor workers showing them x-rated videos and drinking with them. Now I've realized that I'm one of them. Leave if you want to. I'll forget everything. I won't be wondering if you are all right. Whether you're beaten by someone, whether you meet a nice girl to live with and think of me sometimes, I won't be wondering. I'll come back. I'll come back to this shop. I don't care. I don't need you. I can manage by myself. Today is May 10th of 1987. Madam Shin of Um-ji Comic Shop opened a little place for the poor and the homeless in a town in Seoul. God of lands, god of kitchen, god of sageness, god of videos, god of martial art stories god of comics, and god of noodles! All come for the ceremony and fulfill our wishes. Let the poor and homeless come here to take to a good rest. Let the violent and low grade comics go away. Let the best comics with good stories come in to make everybody happy.

Everybody, stay where you are! Hey! Where's Jee-ho Min? Search him! There's a little passage here! - Where's the guy? - That way, sir. Can't you see him? Such a slippery bastard! Where the hell is the guy? Jee-ho Min! Jee-ho Min! This is No. 3. I got the aim. Answer me, please. Yes. He's on the rooftop. There are other people as well. Got it. He's behind it. Jee-ho Min! Come out here! Come on! Come out! Be quick! We don't want to make a fuss. It's over now. Don't try anything useless. What are you hesitating for? You want a real punishment? You're forcing us. Don't make other people get hurt. Come out here! Come on! This is your last chance. Give in! Don't move! Are you crazy? Yes, I am. If you move, this woman is dead. I'll kill her. Mr. Hwang!

You thought I would act as a spy for you? Dong-pal, don't do this. - I'll surrender myself. - Dong-pal Hwang. Just shut up! - What do you want? - Run now! - Don't come any closer! - What's the reason? You want to end up like this? Just run away! Let her go free. Run! Run away. - Do you know - Right now. what you're doing now? Stop it before it gets worse. Don't move a step forward. That's enough! - We won't stand it anymore! - Dong-pal, please. Release her. It's the last warning! Go! Stay there! I'll kill her. Dong-pal! Dong-pal! Dong-pal! Dong-pal! It's daylight savings time for Seoul Olympics starting today.
