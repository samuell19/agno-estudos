April. Babe. Yeah? You're chewing your nails. You told me to tell you when you're chewing your nails. All right, thank you. Are you nervous? No, I'm good. Oh my. God. Has your sister always done that? You have no idea. It's like a hibernating bear. Your sister's getting less hot by the second. Wake her up. What's going on? Oh, nothing. Did you sleep well? I wasn't sleeping, I was just resting my eyes. Oh my God. Do you still do that? What? Sleep denial. She's always done that. Shut up. I do not. I wasn't sleeping. Susie, I hate to break it to you, but you snore, too. I do not. Like a bear. Shut up. You sound like a chainsaw. Like a vintage Harley. Screw you guys. Here we go, Gibbons. This is it. What are you thinking? That you're crazy. You maybe right. But I might just be the lunatic you're looking for. Really? You're quoting Billy Joel songs these days? It's a good song. I wish I could go back in time and tell 21-year-old Scott that. One day, he's going to listen to Billy Joel and love it. What's wrong with Billy Joel? I love him. It's her fault. Hey! Wait. But- Wait, he sang Rocket Man, right? No. That was Elton John. Close though. I love Elton, too. I'm sure you do. What about you Scott? Do you love Elton? He's got some good songs. Fuck. OK, why don't you go open the gate and we go see this house that you bought us before I strangle your friend. All right. Hey, you're chewing your nails again. Oh, yeah. She's always done that. You're getting that, right? This is awesome. Oh my God. What do you think? Well, it doesn't really look like the picture. Well. Yeah, it's an old picture, but I mean hell, we bought it for the land right? House is just a bonus. I think it's fucking awesome. As soon as I go pee in them woods over there, we got to check it out. That's what I'm talking about. Yes. Anybody want to come join me? Ha ha ha ha ha. It's not that bad, right? No, it's not that bad. We have a lot of work, but it's not that bad. Wah! Fuck. Woah, tiger. Calm down. Thought I heard something out there. You mean, like, there's animals in the woods? That's crazy. Fuck off, I'm serious. Come on, tiger. Let's go check out the rest of the house. Don't call me tiger. Dude, wait till you see in there, man. It's full of stuff. Oh, yeah? Yeah. It's not that bad of shape either. I'm going to go get a flashlight. I'll meet you all in there. It smells in here. April? In here. Calm down, tiger. Are you kidding me? Duh, light switch. Hey, what do you got there? Woah, Gibbons. Creepy. Guy looks like a dick. It feels like an estate sale. Dead people stuff. Hey, what do you say we go and look at the rest of the house? It's a good size. Yeah, definitely. Oh, yeah. You know that means it's small, right? I was not snoring. I was not snoring! Do you think they deliver pizza out here? Pretty sure they deliver out here. Scott, no running water. Yeah. Well boo hoo. That's the , right? Oh, who knows. OK this room freaks me out a little. The children's room. Oh God, don't say it like that. Seriously, man. This might not be the best time to ask, but do we know what happened to the-- What's their name? Gibbons. No. No, nothing. Jamie, your hairdryer is heavy. To the left. Hold on. Stop. Oh, god. Right here. Why exactly are we the ones doing this? All right, hold it tight. Oh come on, don't fuck up and karate chop me in the face. Six years of martial arts training. When you were fucking kid. Now hurry up, come on. Don't worry about it. Just stop getting in my face. All right, on three. One, two-- Fucking shit. What did I tell you? Man. Double brown belt. I'm kind of a bad ass. Yeah, I'd say so. That was fucking-- I'm impressed dude. You got to show Susie that. I'm serious. You can work that. No woman's ever been able to resist it. I can't believe how cold it is in here. So now that I've got you alone, is there something you want to tell me? Whatever do you mean? Well how about you start with why you showed up on my doorstep in the middle of the night? Drunk. Don't forget that. Yes, very drunk. And how long has it been since you've last seen me? OK, we don't have to talk about this. I'm sorry. It's OK. Look, I'm just really glad to see you. I'm so glad you decided to come with us this weekend. Hey man, I really appreciate you coming out here. Of course, man. No man, I mean it. It means a lot. It's been kind of a rough year. What's going on? April had a miscarriage last January. Fuck, man. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, she was almost full term. There were complications and she had to have a hysterectomy. They go in they take your ovaries and her uterus, and-- I know what a hysterectomy is. Sorry, yeah, right. No, but, she took it really hard, man. I guess what I'm saying is, buying this house and all this land. I just felt like we needed a distraction. An adventure together, you know? I get it. I think it's a great idea. Yeah? No. Really, you're the only way I could make this happen. Seriously. Buying this place let me-- It means a lot that you came out here and you're going to help me fix the place up. Listen, man. We're going to make this place great. These guys I got coming out here tomorrow, they're good dudes. You're going to like them. Great at what they do. A little rough around the edges, but-- Of course. House needs a little bit of work, but ain't nothing we can't handle, right? Well? Right. You doing all right? Thanks man. Whoa, hey. All right. All right. Yep. There we go. Yeah. You want any more of this? Well No. You high? I'm high. Dude, I'm fucking blasted. Man, that's why I'm running off at the mouth. You know. That's fine, man. But we should probably gather this shit up. Yeah. Get back inside. Get the wood. I made the mistake of telling Susie I had a bottle of scotch, so-- Oh. The men have returned from scouring the forest. Check it out. Are the men thirsty? Thanks, you're too kind. Wait. What is that? Is that pot? Maybe. Do you have more? Maybe. I want to smoke some weed. Really? Yeah. Where is it? Yeah. All right, let's party, then. We got a bottle of good scotch, some good weed. Woo! All we need is some good music. We do have good music, right? Music. Wait. Shut up. Wait, Scott. You were in a punk band? Are you kidding me? This guy was so fucking punk rock, you wouldn't believe it. It's true. When we met, he used to wear a spiked dog collar. That is awesome, man. Is it bad that I have so much more respect for you? Because I do. Yeah, it's pretty awful that you didn't have any respect for me. I have to admit, you were a really cute punk rock boy. Yeah? OK, but were they any good? Yes. Are you serious? We were fucking awesome. What were you called? Cracked fetus. What? That is the best band name ever. It was his idea. OK, so did you release an album? Please, God say yes. Yeah, we had one album. Small vinyl pressing. Do you have a copy? I do. Oh my God, I have to hear it. You should come over sometime. I still have a turntable, you know. Definitely. Man, I think I'm going to to call it a night. I'm not tired, so do you want to get out of here and let them get some sleep? Yeah. Yeah, OK. Night, bro. Night. Goodnight you guys. Y'all be careful. Love you, sis. Love you, too. Hey, just make sure you're in the back in here it's really cold everywhere else. OK, you got it. So, ready to go to bed? Ready to call it a night? I'm not really that tired. Are you? No. Not at all. That was amazing. I love you. I love you, too. So much. Sorry it's been so long. You don't need to say that. You don't need to do that. I know, but I just feel like things are going to be different from now on. I'm done with being sad all the time. Why do you feel better? I think I love this house. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There was a man at the window. What? Yes, I saw him. Where? I don't know, he was just there. What's going on? April said she saw somebody out the window. No, I did. There was a man. He was out there. He was peeking in at me. Did he have long hair, big bushy beard? Yeah, I think so. That would be Bobby. He's one of my guys. See, I told you. Hey, I'm sorry. Hank. You scared the shit out of me. I scared you? Hell. Where's Bugs? He's out here sniffing around somewhere. He'll show up. Well, come on in. Hey, Hank. Scott. Hey Scott. It's good to meet you. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you son. Yeah, likewise. Well hello, ladies. Hank. Hank Strong. Hi, I'm April. This is. Susie Oh, Susie. Let me guess. You girls must be sisters. You guessed it. Yeah, OK. Where is Bugs? Bugs! Where have you been? Checking the place out. Man, it is awesome. Hey, I'm Scott. Come on in, man. It's not much warmer, but-- Yeah, I love your place, man. It's magical. Oh, thank you, both of you, for coming out. Hey, yeah no problem. It's like coming on vacation for us. Hey, I'm Bugs. Oh, this is my wife, April, and her sister Susie. Hi, I think we met back in the kitchen. Oh yeah, sorry about that. Hank and Bugs here are my two best guys. Hank is an electrician and a master carpenter, and Bugs, believe it or not, something of a jack of all trades when it comes to construction. It's a gift. It runs in my family. You don't say. No, I do. Well, I was just about to make some coffee. Are you guys hungry? We've got energy bars, health muffins. Oh, muffins. What about this insulation? I don't really want to try to use that. You can't use that. OK, good. Because it's-- Bugs. Bugs. Bugs. Hey, yo, what's up? What are you doing over there? Nothing. You don't want to be checking out the boss's wife's ass now, would you? What? Oh, heck no. Oh, boys. Found it. So, what I was saying is, we should fix the roof first because it could start raining any day now. Sounds like a plan. Are there any more leaks in the house? Yeah, this is the worst of it though. It's a big f-ing home, man. No shit, Sherlock. That's what we're talking about while you're over there in ass land. So how all did y'all meet again? We'll just be right outside, OK? OK. What are you all going to be up to in here? Probably setting up beds for everyone. Yeah, well there's the two mattresses in the back. So you just bring those to the living room. No, I don't like that room. It's creepy. All right, I'll do it when I get back. OK, we'll see. Be careful. OK. Don't freeze out there. I won't. Last night was great. Yeah. I love you. Love you. All right, now go, so we can close this door. OK. What's up? What's up? What? Man, I haven't gotten high this early in, I don't know how long. Get used to it. It's how we do it. Where's the beer? Duh, where do you think? I don't know. Scott, you want a beer? Man, it's like like what, 10:30 i? The morning. So? I'll take one. Yeah, you would. Give me one too. All right, shit. Guess I'll have one, too. A toast, to my friend Scott. This land, may treat us kindly. Hear, hear. Cheers. What are you doing? Wake and bake. You want some? Isn't it kind of early to be getting stoned? To get drunk maybe, not high. OK, not like that. Don't actually touch your lips, just suck. Yeah, there you go. You're going to get so high. Great. Must be bugs up there. Well-- You know one's my wife, right? Hell, yeah. So hey Scott, Drew tells me you bought this place off the internet? Yeah, online auction. Oh man, I never heard of no one buying a house online before. It needs a little work. I don't know if you noticed, but the brick facade is kind of coming off a little bit. Yeah, I guess it's pretty bad. It could be worse. How long was it empty? About 15 years. Wow. Yeah. Did you get a good deal? Not really your business, Bugs. No, that's OK. Yeah, I got a good deal. Tell me this, though. You did come out and look at it before you bought it, right? Not at all. I just looked at a picture online, you know? And it turned out to be 20 years old, but hey. What? My friend, you have some big balls. Why was it empty for so long? Guys, come on. Man, it's all right. Believe me, I've had this conversation more than once. And I haven't told anybody this, not even April. Uh oh. I know what that means. What? It's a murder house. Yeah, so the previous owners, policeman and his wife. Did you know when you bought it? Well, they had to tell me before I signed the papers, so yeah. Did they tell you what happened? No. But I looked it up. Yeah. The husband had his head bashed in. And his penis, his cut off. Let him finish. And the wife, she had her throat cut and her tongue cut out. Did they find the penis? Yeah. In the wife's mouth. That's fucking insane. What about the tongue? I don't know. It wasn't anywhere I read, so-- Hey. Did they find out who did it? No. Wait. What about the kids? There's pictures of these people inside-- Right. And there's kids in it. Yeah. Twins. The kids, the twins. Yeah, apparently they went missing or ran off a few years before. And you haven't told April about any of it? No. And y'all don't tell her anything either. Don't. I mean, I'm going to tell her, OK? Just, eventually. Not now. I knew there was something off about this house. It's got a weird energy. Oh God, here we go. Y'all know what, man, I'm very positive about this. There's something strange. Yeah we know. Runs in the family. Oh you guys are a regular Abbot and Costello. Fuck. Let him go, man. He'll be back. Bugs, come back. Hey, there's a pond over here. God, I look ancient. No you don't you look great. Are you kidding me? I've got bags under my eyes. Yeah, well that's from drinking and partying too much. It's not from being old. Well, maybe I should try playing grown up like you. What's that supposed to mean? You know what I mean. I'm just too old to still be in school. No, I don't think so. I know a lot of people who are your age that are getting their doctorate or their masters or something. Exactly. That's the thing. I changed my major three times. I still have a year before I got a degree in anything. So, what is it now? RTBF. What's RTBF? It's radio, television, video, and film. So which One is it? Huh? Radio, television, film, which one? Film, I guess. I don't know. Film? What are you going to do with a film degree? Make movies, I guess. I don't know. Can we change the subject? It's depressing me. Oh my god. Come here. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I was never going to leave you. Got to give me just a little more space. I need just a little more pressure. Free this mind to freely function. I take in all the oxygen mindless thoughts in carefree times. Just a little more complicated. No reflex needs more confession. I've been away. for awhile. Man, I'd totally turn this property to a deer lease. What is that, a damn time saver? Shit, we done lost an hour of sleep. This is so cool, man. I've always wanted to go skinny dipping with you guys. I tell you, we bring the sisters down here, I'll be dipping. Man, I got rights. I told you, that's my wife. Shit. Man, I knew there was a pond on the property, but I was not expecting this. Man, I wonder if there are any fish. Hey, we brought our gear. Well hell yeah, there's fish in there. I bet there's some big mothers swimming around the bottom just waiting to get snatched up. Yeah, I'm going to go get the gear. Bugs? We're still on the clock, man. Hey, no. It's OK. They can go fishing. I don't mind. No, let's finish our work first. Once we finish, we can come back. Fishing better in the evening, anyway. Always has been. You look so beautiful. I'm sorry I wasn't there to see you when you were-- It was the happiest I've ever been. It just felt so right being pregnant, you know? I'm so sorry, April. So when I lost the baby-- It's so fucking unfair. I am sorry I wasn't there for you. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to be around you. It's OK. No, it's not. I am a bad sister. Please, stop saying that. Are you OK? It's been really hard, but I feel better seeing you again. And Scott buying this house, as crazy as that sounds, it's made a huge difference. I feel good again. Just happy. Good, I'm glad. And I'm done with being a selfish bitch, OK? So you're going to see a lot more of me. OK. I'm not going to sleep with you. Thank you baby, I appreciate you not doing that. Bugs, though. Oh man guys, you know what? We got about a couple of hours of daylight left, so when y'all are done eating, just, y'all go fishing man. Yeah, I'm going to stick around here and get things ready for tonight. Maybe look at that hot water heater. I'll stick around and help. No, man. Go fishing. You deserve it. Hey let me stay up here and help you with the hot water heater. No Hank, you don't need to do that, man. Yeah, well. These two amateurs? Fish will still be there when we get finished. You OK? Man, what's the deal with you and Susie? Are you and her, you know, intimate? Intimate? Oh, fuck. I swear there's an old man trapped inside of you. Well, are you? Yeah we kind of hooked up last night. Yeah, that's what I figured. Man, what does she see in a geezer like you, anyway? Are you jealous? No. Hey, should we grab some of these beers? Bugs. You're in luck, my friend electric hot water heater. All right. That's a good thing. Well seeing that the tank outside probably doesn't have any gas in it, I'd say so. All right, so we'll get this thing fixed, then. Well, I didn't say that, but I'm sure as hell going to try. My grandma always told me it was good luck to spit on your bait. Apparently, it wasn't good luck. Yeah. Come on. She's a pretty little thing. Yeah, thanks. You guys got any kids? Oh we've tried, but no. You're lucky. I have two. Oh yeah? Yeah. Live up in Oklahoma with their mama. I don't ever get to see them anymore. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, I am too. That's life, though. Yeah. You think we're going to get any action today? I think you've had enough action, man. Welp! You got something? I think I got something, man. Look at that. That's not too bad, Bugs. Today's your lucky day. Now give me the devil horns. Oh yeah, right? There you go Oh, that's great. Now stick out your tongue. Yeah, you're a warrior. You're a Viking warrior. Yeah. There you go. Somebody's missing a boot, man. All right, you see the boot? Shove it up your ass. I'm going to go pee. What the fuck? Sam! Sam, help me. Sam! Sam! Bugs? God damn it. Fuck. I'll get you, you mother fucker. Help! Bugs? You better not be fucking with me. Bugs? Bugs? Drew? Bugs? Come on guys. Where are you at? Bugs, you better not be fucking around. I don't get it, where could they be? Look. That's Drew's phone. That's today. Why don't you try calling Bugs again? Drew! Bugs! Drew! Nothing. Well, maybe we passed them coming out here. Yeah, we were too noisy. We would have heard them. They would have heard us. Bugs? Drew! Well, what did they leave? Full bottle of beer. I don't like this. Something's not right. Oh my God, Scott. There you are. Have you seen Drew or Bugs? No, I thought they were with you guys. No, we went down by the pond looking for them. All their stuff was there. We found this. Drew's phone? Yeah. Well have you tried calling Bugs? Yeah, we called him down at the pond, but he didn't answer. Oh, man. Well, try calling him again. See if he'll pick up. Service out here sucks. Hey, it's ringing. Shh. Did y'all hear that? Over here. Drew! Bugs? Drew? Bugs! Drew! Bugs! Wait. Wait. Call him again. Bugs! Drew? Drew! Drew! Listen, listen. Over here. Bugs! Bugs! Drew? Bugs! Look for a light switch. Bugs, where are you, brother? Right there. There's a door back here. You and that god damn lie. Somebody's been living in here. No! What is it? They're fucking dead. Their goddamn heads are gone. Go! Get in the house. Go! No, please. Lock the doors. Please. Please help me. No. You can't go back out there. You can't. We have to call the police. I'm not leaving him out there to die. You lock the door, OK? Wait, where are you going? Shh. It might be Scott. OK. Wait. What if it's not Scott? What if it's that man? No! Shh. Oh god, it's locked. Did you turn that on? Shit. Oh, God. Push. Come on, just push. God, you fucking bitch, push. Look, it's a baby. I delivered a baby. Isn't she beautiful? What? What's wrong? It's not right. Something's wrong with it. Don't say that. Don't say that about my baby. April, it's not your baby. Hey. Where's Scott? He's going to meet her. He's going to be so happy. April, Scott's dead. April, everyone's dead. April, we need to go. I've got to get you to the hospital. Hey. April. Don't fucking touch me or my baby. We've got to go. I'm not going anywhere. This is my home. Hi. April, I'm going to go. I'm leaving. OK. I'll send you back some help. Just hang on. Hi. How does it feel? This blood spilling all in out for years. You stand in time to me. But in the morning you will be. How does it feel? This blood's been pumping for years. You are looking right through me. But in the morning you will be.
