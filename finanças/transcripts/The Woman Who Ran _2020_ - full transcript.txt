THE WOMAN WHO RAN Kim Minhee Seo Younghwa Song Seonmi Kim Saebyuk Lee Eunmi Kwon Haehyo Shin Seokho Ha Seongguk Written & Directed by Hong Sangsoo Cinematography - Kim Sumin Recording - Seo Jihoon Technical Manager - Lee Jeahan - Hello. - Are you going out? Lucida Grande My face is puffy, right? A bit. You drank last night? It's a bit puffy. - I did go drinking. - With who? My friends. Really? I have a job interview today. - So that's why you're dressed up. - Yes. You look nice. But my face is so puffy. No, it's fine. It's not puffy. You look fine. But I'm so nervous. Really? Do your best. You'll do well. I'll try, but I'm not optimistic. Really? It's good to see you. Bye. See you later. Gamhee! Gamhee! Youngsoon! You really came. It's been so long. How did you know I arrived? - There's a CCTV at home. - Really? - Was it hard getting here? - No, it was easy. Though I drove past the entrance. - Really? - But it didn't take long. That's a relief. - It's pretty here. - You cut your hair? Just a few days ago. How does it look? Odd? It's much shorter than before. Your hair was really long. I got tired of it, so I cut it. - I did it myself. - What? - You cut it? - In the bathroom. Then I went to a hair salon and had it done right. I see. You look like a flighty high school student. Really? It's cute. You look young. I look flighty? No, it's cute. You look so young. I brought some meat. They said it's good. Right, you wanted meat. Good job. - I got makgeolli, too. - You brought alcohol? I can't drink. Anyway, good job. Do you like meeting up with people? That's what everyone does. It's needed. I used to meet people often. It does make you tired. I don't want to see anyone. When I do, I say things I don't need to say, and do things I don't need to do, I'm sick of it. You've changed. I guess so. When is your roommate coming? We need to grill the meat. A bit late, in about an hour. You're hungry? A bit, and I'm craving meat. She grills really well, like a pro. - Really? - It'll be tasty. - Great. - She's really good. But how did you end up here? Did you buy or rent it? I bought it. With the money from the divorce, and a loan. It's so nice here. With that gorgeous mountain, and the birdsong. It's great. I want a place like this. It's so remote, it's hard to get around. I only go out when I have to. So, what is he doing, your ex? Are you in touch? No, why stay in touch? - Splitting up was so hard. - Is he still working? Sure. More than before, I think. Still writing plays, and directing. He deserves to fail, doesn't he? It may yet happen. How are things with your husband? We're always together. We've never been apart. - Really? - Yes, this is the first time. It's just a short trip, so I didn't join him. The first time in 5 years. You've never been apart in 5 years? Not once. Not for a single day. That's what he wants. He says people in love should always stick to each other. You two are amazing. I guess we're very compatible. We manage to have good moments every day. Is that so? But I don't know... I really need time to myself. It was hard seeing someone every day. For me, spending all day with someone is unbearable. My husband thinks you're a really good person. That's why I came. Really? There aren't many people around me he likes. Of course I really like you, but that's good too. When I tell him I saw you, he'll be so happy. You really love meat. I didn't used to, but these days I like it. It's another thing that changed with age. You don't like meat? I like it. - But you're not eating much. - I'm eating. Youngji, come eat. I feel bad that we're eating alone. Yes, I will. You bought really nice meat. It's delicious. - Isn't it? - Yes, it's high quality. She loves meat. If you let her, she'd eat everything here. Living with me, she can't eat meat, since I don't eat it. Yes, I'm so happy today! You grill it so well, this is delicious. No, it's just really high quality meat. I wanted to become vegetarian. I still do. Really? Me, too. Really? Yes, seeing cows makes me so sad. Yes, you're right. Aren't their eyes beautiful? Once I went to the country, and I saw some calves running in a field. There was a newborn, it didn't even know what it was, and it was so beautiful, those eyes, all black, were just beautiful. The most beautiful eyes in the world, among animals. More beautiful than humans, too. - They're beautiful animals. - Right. Our minds and bodies are totally separate. I mean, our consciousness can easily interact with cows. But our bodies don't care in the least. They're just ruled by instinct. - That's what makes things hard. - Right. I think I can give up meat now. Just eat it. If your body craves it, go ahead. It feels good to have this consciousness, but I'm not sure if cows can feel that. Let's eat! Sorry. I'm slow by nature. Not at all, thank you. - Is the coffee okay? - Yes, it's good. I worried it might be too weak. She doesn't like strong coffee. - This is perfect for me. - Really? All right, then. Enjoy. Thank you. Thank you. It's great. That's good. Thanks to you, we had so much meat, and so much alcohol. - That's good. - Is it good? Your face isn't as flushed as it was before. My face gets so red, I don't usually drink. I must have been happy to see you. You've been close for a long time? Yes, we've been close. Have we? But I guess you haven't drank together. I don't think we have. Back then, we didn't really drink together. Right. Next time, we'll treat you. If you tell me what you want to eat, we'll prepare it ahead for you. No, this was delicious. You went to so much trouble. We're so far away, it's not easy getting here. Still, it's great. It's like the countryside. The air is nice and I can hear the chickens. - You hear the chickens? - I heard them before. So you heard them. The two of you raise chickens? No. It's not us, it's our neighbor. Our plot borders on theirs. The coop is above their plot. It's not our land. I see. But they must crow every morning. You wouldn't believe it. He's so loud. But those chickens... it's a bit horrible. Really? There's a rooster there. But he's so mean. Why? Every day he climbs up on the backs of the hens. Then he pecks at the back of their necks. If you look closely, the hens have no feathers there. He must be trying to mate. It's not that, he's just doing it for show. He does it on purpose to prove he's the strongest. He's so mean. Wow. He really is mean. So if you go up close, they have no feathers there at all. Really. It's horrible. Just a minute. - Hello? - Hello. - I moved in next door. - I see. - I have a favor to ask. - What is it? It's my first time seeing you, right? Yes, I think so. Are you feeding those cats? They're strays, robber cats? Well... I'm not sure if they're robber cats, but we feed them. They call them robber cats for a reason, right? Right. Because you feed them, the cats keep coming here. Yes... So actually it makes us very uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable? I'm sorry. But I'm not sure what we can do. It's an important matter. - My wife is very sensitive. - Is she? She's very scared of cats. So, she's scared to come out in the yard. I see. It's absurd not being able to come outside. Sure. It's a real shame she's scared of cats. Still, these cats have to survive. It's an important matter. That's true, but people come first. We shouldn't encourage these robber cats to come in, right? Yes, people are important. But it's very important for these cats to eat. So that's why I feed them. I'm sorry. But they're not people. Neighbors are more important, right? Right, neighbors are important. They're important, and it's just as important for cats to eat. I'm sorry. What to do? Well, can't you do anything? You call them robber cats, but actually to us, they're like children. That's why we feed them. But they're not kids. But we think of them that way. You call them robber cats, but you've never seen them steal anything, have you? We think of them as children, so we feed them every day. I'm sorry. Is something wrong? They've just moved in. They're scared of cats, so they're asking us not to feed them. - Hello. - Hello. Do you have to feed them? Yes, we intend to. Why? Really? As long as it's not against the law. There must be a residents' council here? Very well then. Have a nice day. Go in, it's cold. Wait a minute. We'll get you some food. Can't sleep? Use this. It's cold at night. What is it? Who is that? She's so scary. She's a neighbor's daughter. Really? What's she doing late at night? Sometimes she smokes here. Her father's a bit scary, so she comes here. Sneaking around late at night, it's creepy. Her mom ran off. So it's hard for her. Her mom ran off and left her? How did she run off? She just left at night, and didn't come back. She's missing? Out of contact? Right. She lives with her father, but he's not coping with it well. How old is she? Twenty-six? You know her age. Sometimes we smoke together and talk. She had a job interview today. I better go see her. Go to sleep. Okay. Sleep some more. Why are you awake? What are you doing? I went to the bathroom. Really? As I get older, I go more often. What's the secret of the 3rd floor? What? The secret of the 3rd floor. What secret? Then why is the 3rd floor blocked off? Because it's so dirty. I don't think so. You don't trust me? Of course I trust you. Then why is the 3rd floor blocked off? Sorry, it's just too dirty. Don't get any wrong ideas. All right, then. Go back to sleep. I bought this for me, but I think it will fit you. It's oversized. It'll look good on you. This is my favorite brand. It was great when Grenier was still there. - Now their designs have changed. - You're right. - This is his design? - Yeah, it's his. How does it look? - It's nice. - Is it? It fits well. It's perfect for me. - It doesn't suit you? - It looks better on you. And the color goes well with your face. Thanks. Want more coffee? No, that's enough. Too much coffee makes me tired. Right, I remember. The mountain here is incredible. Which mountain is it? Mt. Inwang. - Impressive, right? - Yeah. The first time I came here, that mountain in the window was like an old painting. You know the painting I mean. What was his name? The person who painted "Mt. Inwang After the Rain". What was his name? Why can't I remember names? He's really famous. - Jeong Seon! - Yes, that's right. It's so frustrating. These days I can't remember anyone's name. You too? I just can't remember anything. You know fish oil? Try that. They say it helps with memory. I'm already taking it. But it's not helping. It's really serious. We need to take care of ourselves. The design of this place is great. Like a proper architect designed it. I think so. I saw the upstairs, too. It's really nice. I was so lucky. The Jeonse deposit is $500,000. But I got a $100,000 discount. Really? Who heard of a $100,000 discount? So at first I thought the landlord was scamming me. But no. Really? Why'd he do it? The landlord lives upstairs, and I think he likes artists. So he rents to artistic people. Then how'd you get in? I still produce dance performances. You didn't know? No, I didn't. You're still doing that? Not often. Once every two or three years... You were really fortunate. Saving $100,000? Different from your last place. It's so nice. I want to live in a place like this. It's nice. Actually it's smarter to buy an apartment. The prices on these type of homes don't go up. But I like this neighborhood. So I'm happy. I lived with my mom so long. It was a long time. You did well. You did well. It's great, the mountain. With such a discount, I had to take it. Then are you still teaching Pilates? Sure, that's my income. Do a lot of people sign up? Not bad. More than before, actually. Then you're all set. Things are good. I'm saving, too. I'm going to save $1 million. Seriously? You're amazing. I've been teaching a long time. Now I can buy whatever I want. Good for you, saving so much money. That includes the Jeonse deposit? Of course. Really, you're amazing. I want to have fun. I've always held myself back. That's why I moved here. You did well. Your home is nice. The area's fun, too. It's a fun neighborhood. Lots of nice houses and good restaurants. Right. I found an interesting bar, too. It's really nice. - A bar? - Yeah. I'm thinking of going more often. Lots of regulars there, most of them artists. Film directors, writers, novelists, and architects... people like that. Every day they get together and sing or whatever, it looks fun. I see. Is it far? It's close. 15 minutes? I'm thinking of becoming a regular there. Sounds good. Is something burning? Oh no! Oh my god. Is it okay? Is it okay? Yeah, it's fine! You're eating a lot. It's delicious. I'm told it's no good. - Says who? - Someone I know. I'm a bad cook, like my mom. She can only make things salty or spicy. Really? Who says it's no good? I wish I could cook. It's tasty. No it's not. Just eat. I ate it all. It was good. Thank you, for enjoying it. And I really love the clothes, too. It really suits you. - Really? - Yes. Will your husband be gone long? Just a few days. We've never been apart until now. Surprised? Why not? In 5 years we've never once been apart. - Amazing, right? - How can that be? It's what he wants. He says people in love should stick to each other. - It's natural, he says. - That's nice. Some people are like that. Do you really love your husband? Me? I don't know. It's not something you can prove. But if I feel some love each day, I think it's enough. - You think so? - Yes, I do. I feel it each day. Wow, it's love. This is what it's like to be loved. You're really fortunate. I think so. But there are so few decent guys. And Koreans... my god. It's pretty bad. So hard to find. Everyone has a match somewhere. I met a man recently. - At that bar. - The place you mentioned? Not long ago, I stopped by and met him then. On my first visit to the bar. Really? Who is he? He's gentle-looking, an architect. He looks gentle, and he's really thoughtful. Really? You know what's funny? He lives on the second floor here. - Isn't it funny? - Really? Yeah. You didn't know it, when you met him? No, I'd never seen him. I haven't lived here long. Anyway, we left the bar, started walking, and kept going in the same direction. All the way here. It was so funny, both of us in front of the house. - He's just upstairs. - That's so funny. How could that be? But he's married. Well, separated but still married. It's okay, they're almost divorced. Did he design this house? I don't know, I doubt it. He just rents the place. Did he get the $100,000 discount? I didn't ask. - I doubt it. - Really? He's separated? Yes. He lives alone. These days I'm producing a dance performance. He volunteered to do the stage art, so I said yes. He'll do well, he's talented. Very intelligent. Must be fun doing that. Without it, I get burned out. I need something. That must be exciting. I want something like that. I've too many interests. It's hard to settle on one. But you have a flower shop, right? It's boring. Hardly any customers. It's a quiet area, but a clothes shop next to me does well. In the flower shop, there's no work. I like flowers, but... Well, it's not like you need to support yourself. Why do you keep coming here? It's not normal. I was just out for a walk, and thought I'd stop by. You're not answering your phone? Guess I missed the call. Are you a stalker? What do you mean, stalker? Stalker, stalker. Don't you understand? I'm just... Can we talk inside for a minute? You really don't get it, do you? Why should you come into my home? You're really out of line. Can't we talk inside? It'll just take a minute. Why? Are you cold? A warm room and a warm body would be so nice now, right? But guess what? It's not going to happen. Can you stop humiliating me? Treat me like a human being? I'm a human, too. I need some more time, even if we break up. If you just push me away, what am I supposed to do? I keep thinking of you. I can't control my feelings, so what should I do? You should at least take some responsibility. Aren't you willing to help? Are you really that cruel? You're insane. You think we're dating? Why should you mean anything to me? Get a grip, you fucking... Keep going. I'll take it, like last time. Scream your heart out, get furious, treat me like dirt. Humiliate me, go ahead! I humiliated you? When? You humiliated me! I humiliated you? But, what did I do wrong? Just go away. Go! Don't show up here like a creep. You humiliated me! This young poet keeps coming. He's crazy. Really? He's young, but so rigid. I see. He's young, but so inflexible. Young? Really young. Only twenty-six. He's a baby! It's no laughing matter. Sorry. But what happened between you two? I ended up sleeping with him once. I was drunk. You slept with him? He came here late at night, calling me. I was really drunk, and annoyed. I thought about it, then just did it. It was a big mistake. Right. But I met him at that bar. That's the problem. It could be. He goes to that bar often, but if he ends up talking to the guy who lives upstairs, it could be bad, so I'm worried. I can see why. Why did I sleep with him? I must be crazy. It's okay. No, he's a mental case. He's a poet, but he talks so much, especially when he's drunk. Crazy fool, why did he come that night? Still, you seem to be living a fun life. No fun at all, it's exhausting! It looks fun. It's no good living this way at my age. I'm going to wash my face. Oh, me too. Do it after me. Suyoung, you'll be fine. I'm going crazy! You'll be fine! Thanks for believing in me. I do! You'll get through this. Okay. - Goodbye! - Bye! - Sorry for my cooking. - Go on in. - I'll see you. - Bye! Woojin. This is from yesterday. Why give it to me? You keep it. - Me? - Yeah. Okay. Are people arriving already? Yeah, a bit. Tomorrow should be full. I think so. - Did you go downstairs? - I did. Mr. Jung seems really popular these days. Are you happy? Why should I be happy? Still, he's your husband, you must be happy. I have no wish for him to be famous. He should just focus on what he's good at. He published a lot of books. He did. Too many. I don't know. Do I have an inferiority complex? Ah... I'm tired. Do your best today. Thanks, but Mr. Jung's so smart, I'm intimidated. Don't worry, you don't have to do much. Just remember the list of questions. Yes. Is it cold in the basement? It's warmed up, it's fine. Okay. Then I'll go down and get ready. No need to rush. Okay! Hi. Have you been well? Yeah. It's you. Strange meeting you here. Yeah, really. I work here. You came for a movie? Yes, I came to see a movie. - You work here? - Yes. I didn't know. I've worked here two years. I didn't know you were here. You look the same, still skinny. Yeah? I have something to say to you, okay? Sure. You came alone? Yes. Are you married? Yes. And you? Of course. Oh, right. I knew that. I heard it before. Who did you marry? You're curious? A guy, just some guy you don't know. I see. I thought of you sometimes. Really? I never run into you. Other people I run into every so often. But not you. Seoul is so big. Right. If you stay in your own area, you never see people. Right. It's been so long. - Here's your coffee. - Thanks. It's good to talk to you like this. How are you doing? Me? I'm fine. What about you? Not bad. Life's a bit boring. You wanted to say something to me? Yes. There is. How should I say it? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Don't say sorry. It's nothing. There's no need for that. Don't think about it. Really? Thank you. It's in the past, but I really wanted to say sorry. No, I hardly even remember it. So don't worry, it's fine. Forget it. - You really feel that way? - I really do. I never think about the two of you. Okay. That's good, then. I'm really sorry. I felt really bad. It's okay. Okay. All right, then. Oh my. It's so nice here. It is. Woojin. - Is the movie over? - Yeah. - Can I come in? - Sure. I'm no good at this. It's okay. Have some. Thanks, but I ate a lot already. Really? I ate bread in the theater. Really? You're not supposed to eat in the theater. Sorry. - Did you like the film? - Yes, it was peaceful. It was nice, thanks. Why thank me? For showing a good movie. I thought you came to see Seonggu. - Really? I didn't. - I know. Is he doing something here? A book concert. In the basement theater. He does those? It got scheduled here. It's annoying. I don't know book concerts, never been to one. What is it? Just a meeting with an author. Then they add things in the middle. Show videos, invite a singer... - You prepare all that? - No, the staff here does it. I don't even go down. Why not? Honestly, I don't like that he's so popular. It's not good. - Really? - Yeah. For him, either. Are you two doing well? Not bad. We each have our own work, so we keep busy. It's fine, we've been together a long time. Do you talk a lot? Well... Sometimes when we drink at home. But after so long, we don't talk much. I saw him on TV. Did you? How did you feel? He talks so much. Made me wonder if I ever really knew him. He's changed, it seems to me. He loves to talk. Whatever the subject, he blurts out everything he knows. I'm sick of it! Really? You didn't date him very long. And back then, he wasn't so talkative. He was more serious. Sharper. Right. But now he's styled himself as an orator. Yeah. What I hate about the TV is, he keeps saying the same thing. It's absurd how he repeats himself. My own husband, rattling off the same comments over and over in front of people... - It's hard to take. - Sure. He says the same thing? If he just repeats himself, how can that be sincere? Right. That means it's all from memory, but how can that be sincere? And with that serious face. Right. It seems ridiculous. What is that? It's stupid. Why does he do it? Why does he? He'll regret it later. Or he might go around boasting of it. Will he? Have an apple. Looks good. What does your husband do? Translating, from English. He teaches, too. Wow, what does he translate? Mostly he does history books, or sometimes novels. That sounds fun, translating. He's home every day. He wakes up at dawn and translates until noon, then he teaches 2-3 days per week. - That's how we live. - Really? Why come alone today? He's on a business trip. It's our first time apart in ages. Really? We're hardly ever apart. In the 5 years since we married, we haven't spent a day apart. Really? How is that possible? He says, people in love should always stick together. That it's natural. Wow, Seonggu is the total opposite. But I think it's good. You think so? Yeah, I'm envious. I think people are more envious of you. Tell them not to be. What do they know? You're right. It's tasty. - Tasty? - Yeah, it's good. Wow, tasty! Good, right? - It's sweet. - It's tasty. You can smoke here. Thank you. - Do you need anything else? - No. Then I'll wait inside. - I'll be right down. - Okay. I heard you came. You've been well? You were here? Hello. I've got a thing downstairs. How've you been? I was talking with Woojin upstairs. I see. You met her again upstairs? I heard many people came. I guess so. I don't know. Now that I'm older, seeing you is awkward. Really? I feel comfortable. You're uncomfortable? It's just awkward. You still smoke. They say you have to die to quit smoking. The stress from quitting is worse than the cigarettes. That's what a doctor said. How could you come here? Don't smoke too much. Did you call me once? Yeah. It's been a long time. You think I came because of you? I didn't. You didn't? Never mind, then. How have you been? Yes, I have a good life. Do you? That's great. I saw you on TV. You did? It's funny, right? You talk a lot. You talked so much, later I doubted if you were sincere. If you keep talking so much, you'll lose it completely. You really should just stop talking. That's what you felt? Not that it concerns me. Then why'd you come? What? I'd better go this way. Goodbye. Oh, okay. See you!
