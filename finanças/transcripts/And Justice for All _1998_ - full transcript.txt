I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to the republic, for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Take your wig off. Take your wig off. Turn and face the wall. Turn and face the wall. Face the wall. All right, that's it. - Are you a natural blonde? - Chicken Delight. He delivers. Don't put that in here. She ain't my type. That's my wife you're talking about. She's here for our conjugal visit. Come, let daddy show you what he's got in his pants for you. She's got the same thing under her skirt that you've got in your pants. Come on, you guys, we've got a lady here. Have you got any concealed weapons they didn't find up front? You've got something concealed... But it ain't no weapon. Let's see you strip just to make sure. A star is born. Kirkland, watch your hands. Come on, Kirkland. Let's go. Can you make a phone call for me? Where the hell is he? What do you mean, he's in jail? My lawyer's in jail? Contempt of court? He's too goddamn emotional. Get him. I've had a car accident. I haven't left the scene of the accident, I'm in it. Can't you hear the confusion? Do you hear this noise? They're trying to get me out of the car. I'm trapped because some prick... Could you move back, so we can get you out? Can't you see I'm on the phone? Keep it down. I'm trying... Goddammit. Tell Arthur to get over here. I'm on Eager Street. Where are we? Eager Street... Just tell him to get over here. You can't miss it. I understand you took a swing at Judge Fleming. Is that true? Kiley, why not do something about that kid? Put him some place else. They're just having some fun with him, that's all. - Fun? - Sometimes the boys get bored. For you, it's still new and exciting. Sign here. Why don't you ease up on the judge? He's your kind of guy, huh? Yeah, Fleming's a tough man. Hates scum almost as much as we do. Good morning, Mr Kirkland. Carl. Come on. Here. Are you all right? Sue the son of a bitch who did this for every cent he's got. Every nickel. - Carl, are you all right? - Disappear. Miss, why don't you... She's not hurt. Nothing to report. Wait in the car. There's no need for the wife to know. After all I was your first client, Arthur. You broke cherry on me. Not the time to go down memory lane. Let's just get you to the hospital. You're the best, Arthur. Get every nickel and put him away. I'll see he gets the death penalty. Death is okay too. You stink. Did somebody piss on you? Get him out of here. Let nobody use my car phone. I'm in the hospital and some jerk calls Rome. You son of a bitch. You lunatic. Carl, you're gonna have a stroke. You'll have to deal with my lawyer. You'll die for this. He's the best. It's not even my car. Be calm, Carl. Be calm. I have a terrible headache. You'll be all right. I'll call you. - What about this guy here? - He says he's all right. It's a friend's car. I just borrowed it for the night. - How am I gonna tell him? - You should go to the hospital. - I'm okay, but the car... - Let me take you to the hospital. My horoscope said it would be a great day and look what happened. Shit. It's not going to be that way this time. We should request a postponement. That would put us into January. Look at me when I'm talking to you. The DA is willing to go two years. That's a lot of fucking time, man. - I ain't kissing nobody's ass. - I'm not asking you to. Just give it a little pat. Arthur. Arthur. Excuse me. Hold it, Wenke. - Where are you going? - The bathroom. Go home and change. You look like shit. What would you say if I walked into court looking like that? What would you say? I don't wanna keep harping on this, but the Ethics Committee is checking up on everyone. You've gotta watch it. Last week two lawyers were disbarred on minor charges. You get thrown in jail on contempt of court. Fleming got me crazy. Push him on that McCullaugh thing and there will be big trouble. McCullaugh's innocent and Fleming won't look at the evidence. - What do you want me to do? - You don't threaten a judge. Will you do me a personal favour? Put this on. I got Fleming first thing this morning. Give him my love. The tie, I like it. It's Fleming's favourite colour. All rise. Criminal Court of Baltimore City is now in session. The Honourable Henry T. Fleming presiding. Be seated. If Your Honour please, for the first matter the State would call case number 57746898, State versus Robert Wenke. Mr Wenke, may I ask you to step forward, please. How many times have you been before the bench, Mr Wenke? Three times, Your Honour. Once for assault, once for arson, once for grand larceny. And now indecent exposure. What's the matter? Can't you decide what you wanna be when you grow up? Anything to say? Yes, Your Honour. I'm a loyal Colts fan. You are also a revolting, despicable scum of the earth who should be squashed like a cockroach. I object. My client has not been found guilty yet. You're absolutely right, Counsellor. It's now 9:40. At 9:41 he will be guilty. I find the defendant guilty. Sentence to be imposed later. I would like Mr Wenke's bail to be continued. - Bail is revoked. - Thank you. The State will now call number 57746899. That was very good work. Very nice. Colts fan. I need Colts? Terrific, Wenke. Then you do know? The big white house? With the fat columns out in front on Greenway Avenue? Guess how much that house is worth. - I don't know. - Take a guess. Seven million. 243,000 dollars. Now that's some nut I've got, huh? I just need some more accident cases. I ought to throw banana peels around. Recess is almost over, and I only have this lottery case... Did you know there's a guy eating something off your table? The guy you're prosecuting. He's eating the lottery tickets. Holy shit. Gibson, get the hell away. Don't swallow, you son of a bitch. That's my client. Don't swallow. Gentlemen, need I remind you you are in a court of law? Now let's proceed in an orderly fashion. What the hell are you doing? Does the defence have anything to add? Your Honour... I guess I should request a recess so my client could get something to eat. He's obviously very hungry. My client, McCullaugh. Could I see him for a minute? Sure, Mr Kirkland. Stick your hand out. Mr Kirkland, what happened? I just want to reaffirm what I said yesterday. We'll get you out. I know you're trying, but this is crazy, you know? I know it. You said you had evidence that proves I'm innocent. - Yes, you're innocent. - And Judge Fleming agrees, right? If everyone agrees I'm innocent, why am I going back to jail? There's enough proof, but the court won't accept it. - Why not? - Well, there's a law... It says that evidence must be submitted within a certain time period. And ours came in three days late. What difference does that make? Even if it came in three years late. They've got the proof they need. They should let me go. The judge sends me to jail and he knows I'm innocent. What's going on? It's gonna take more time. Any other judge would let you out. But Fleming goes by the letter of the law. Jeff, I promise I'll get you out. I promise. He promises to get you out. Don't worry. Judge Fleming. I want to apologise for my behaviour in the courtroom the other day. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything. That's understandable, sir. But I thought maybe we could discuss this McCullaugh case. You and I, man to man. Off the record. If you try to make a deal with me, you might wind up back in jail. A deal? No, sir. I'm not trying to make a deal. I understand your strict enforcement of the statute. But my client's constitutional rights are being denied. My client is innocent. I don't give a shit about your client. Hi, Sherry. - Hi, Mr Kirkland. - Mrs Tate, how are you? He'll be right with you. - Boy, do you look tired. - Coffee, please. Mrs Tate wants to talk. Her son broke his leg again. Neighbour's driveway. And Bricker wants to know if your client will settle for 60,000 dollars. Coffee, please. You have three new clients today. One's a whiplash, one's divorce. And the third has to do with amnesia. I don't know what it is. What are you doing? - No foam. - That's because it's deodorant. Don't forget to visit your grandfather today. - And be in court at two fifteen. - Coffee, please. Do you want some coffee? Sherry, stay with me today, dear. I need you today. Arthur. Arthur, come here. Hi, Judge. Are we gonna get together this weekend? I don't know. You're the only one I've been dating these days. You promised you'd go flying with me. I gotta tell you... I'm not too fond of anything that takes place off the ground. I don't know. I've got a thing about heights. - This is flying. It's different. - How high up do you go? How high do you wanna go? Come on, it'll be good for you. Besides, it gets lonesome up there. Why don't you take your wife? The last thing we did together was get married. Come on, Arthur. You promised me. - All right. What time? - Sunday morning. Ten o'clock. Do you always carry that thing with you? There's law and there's order. And that's order. Do you like egg rolls? - Yeah. - Good. Come on, let's get out of here. Easy, easy, easy. You got it. You son of a gun. So, it's another week already? Another week. I don't know where time goes. No problems, Grandpa? Everything all right? See this one? Wonderful woman. I went to her husband's funeral. Fine man. Gitel? Hello, Sam. How are you? This is my grandson, Arthur. - I'm pleased to meet you. - Good to meet you. - He goes to law school. - I'm a lawyer. Take my advice. Don't be in a hurry. He's a nice-looking boy. - My grandson. - Yes... - Good to meet you. - Pleased to have met you too. So, it's been a week. Yeah, it's been a week. Last week we went for a ride in the car. Remember? That's a good machine. Always give signals when you turn. Right. Left. So... Are you a good lawyer? Are you honest? Well, I don't know. Being honest doesn't have much to do with being a lawyer, Grandpa. If you're not honest, you've got nothing. Your parents should see you now. To hell with them. They never cared before. Why should they care now? - They're still your parents. - No. You raised me. You're the one who put me through law school. You're a wonderful man, Grandpa. But your son, he's a shit. He was born with colic. Sam, I love you. Look at you. Filled out, like a man. Soon you'll look like a lawyer and you'll be a lawyer. I am a lawyer, Sam. I've been a lawyer for twelve years. So, it's another week already. - Do you know Jules Stouffer? - Yes, I do. - He was a client of yours, right? - Yes. Wasn't he originally represented by Alvin Burton? Yes, that is correct. Why did he change representation? I handled him on an assault charge. That's my area, not Burton's. Did Stouffer express dissatisfaction with Mr Burton? Not at all. Burton's an excellent lawyer. Are you going after him? - We're not going after anyone. - Do you know David Crebbs? We're reviewing certain accusations to determine if they're true and to clean our own house. So please do not over dramatise this. It's not the McCarthy hearings. Oh, that's a relief. So you're not gonna ask me: "Are you now or have you ever been a lawyer?" That wasn't amusing, Mr Kirkland. Do you know David Crebbs? No, it wasn't, Miss...? Packer. This isn't amusing. It is ridiculous. Yes, I know David Crebbs. Have you ever seen... Is this mike working? - Do you know David Crebbs? - Why are we using microphones? Why don't we just talk to each other? This is a hearing, Mr Kirkland. Yes. It's a hearing. - Do you know Jules Stouffer? - We've already asked that. Are we through with Stouffer? How about Alvin Burton? - Do you know David Crebbs? - I've already asked that. - What did he say? - He said yes. Have you ever seen him intoxicated in court? David Crebbs has a speech impediment. Check your records. It's in there. As answer to your question: No, he doesn't drink. Not at all. At this point I would just like to say that what this committee is doing in theory is highly commendable. However, in practise it sucks. And I am not going to answer any more questions. What do you think we're trying to do in there? - Want a drink? - No. Whatever you may think, we're not conducting some kind of witch hunt. What are you doing then? You might not be aware of this, but there's a lot of corruption that nobody's doing anything about. Do you think you're doing something? Yes, I do. That committee is a very dangerous farce. Whoa, Mr Kirkland. I spend fourteen hours a day on that committee. I don't do it to get a few good laughs. You could spend the rest of your life. You'll wind up a cop. Maybe ruining the careers of a few guys who wiped their ass the wrong way. Other than that, nothing. So what do you think? About what? About me. What do you think? Think I'm kind of interesting? Somebody you'd like to have a drink with? I think that you're crazy. What about Daniel's? Say, around seven thirty? I don't think so. Eight? Eight thirty. All right. I'm Arthur Kirkland. You wanted to see me? Yeah. My man, Bambi, he recommended you real highly. He said, Arthur Kirkland was the man to see. Okay, Ralph, tell me what happened. It says here you were involved in a robbery. No, sir. What happened is, it was time to come down on a nigger. It's like smoking. They've got to have a nigger every twenty minutes. What happened is... I was in an alley, petting my dog, when they came down on me. It states here the dog was attacking you when you were seen in the alley. Well, my dog, he gets like that. It also states that the dog belonged to a Mrs B. Jackson. He sure looked like my dog. He had that little... It also states that when asked what you were doing you replied: "I don't know nothing about that taxi cab." That's true. I don't. - How did you know there was one? - Mr Kirkland, there's always one. Ralph, tell me the truth or get another lawyer. I don't need the bullshit. Okay. I was in that cab, but I didn't rob it. It was my cousin's idea. I didn't know nothing. He's crazy. - What's your cousin's name? - I don't know. I mean... He lives over on Hillsdale. You don't know your cousin's name? Who do you think you're talking to? Do you think I'm an idiot? I read a report, I can tell if somebody's bullshitting me. Give me straight answers or get another lawyer. I don't have time to listen to some jive-ass put-me-on. Okay. It was
