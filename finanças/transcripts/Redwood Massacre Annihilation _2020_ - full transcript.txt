No, please, please, no, no, no! Honey, I'm home. Where are you? There you are. You had me worried for a moment. I'm afraid it's not good news for you. In fact, it hasn't been a good week for you, Pamela. Has it? Hmm. What am I to do with you? Just isn't working out, is it? It's a shame when you started off so well. We really thought we were going to be a good team. Now, of course I blame myself. I'm too compassionate, too kind. Maybe more of an aggressive approach is what is needed. Maybe I've been going about this the wrong way, huh? I'm starting to believe that I might've been too easy on you. oh, Pammy, Pamela, Pamela, oh come on. Oh, oh. It's okay. It's okay. You're a mess. Maybe we should start over. What do you say, huh? Fresh start. You know, I really admire what he's done. I really do. It's quite a beautiful thing if you think about it. I have to admit, I'm jealous. There, I've said it. I really just have to meet him sometime. Now, why don't we try this again, Pamela. Now, we both know what's gonna happen if you can't be honest with me. You know, this partnership, isn't gonna work if you're gonna hold back. 46 square miles of land is a lot to cover. So you gotta be a little bit more specific this time. Hey, hey. If I wouldn't know any better, I would say you're just stalling for time. So, I've got this all wrong, have I? If I knew where he was, I would've told you. Huh? If I knew where he was- I'm so sorry, I apologize. My, my manners. There you go. Okay, take your time. Shhh. Remember why you're here. Yeah? What did I tell you about begging? Sorry. Now where's the house he took you and your friends to? I've already told you everything. Pamela, this isn't fair. This is supposed to be a fresh start. It's not far from where you found his mask, I promise. So you keep saying, and yet here we are, again. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. You feel this? You're dying, Pamela. I don't know how much more of this you can take. Please. Please. I'm telling you the truth. I know you, but it's just so much fun. Good morning. And thank you all for coming. My name, as I'm sure you're all aware, is Tom Dempsey. So 10 years ago, my daughter, Sarah went on a camping trip with her friends and she never came home. This book documents my investigation into the murders and the years that I spent searching for her. Over 76 people have gone missing in this area in less than 30 years and for a town with a population of some 6,000, that's a pretty terrifying statistic. Only one person survived to tell the story. So is she telling the truth or was she responsible for the disappearance of her friends? We've all heard the Redwood Massacre horror story. So how come the local authorities refuse to investigate? What is it they're not telling us? What is it they're hiding? Interesting fact number three and probably the most salient point of this subject, none of these missing persons have ever turned up. No bodies, no explanations, no answers, nothing. I'm a big fan of your work. I'm very glad to hear it. Who should I make it out to? If you could make out to Max, please. Thanks. I caught your last lecture. I found it most interesting. Most people do. It's just a pity the people who matter tend to ignore my findings. I'm not like most people. Well, Max, like the saying goes, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. 1920, Edmund Burke. Pretty appropriate, right? Yeah, it's a rather amusing quote. Well, there you go. I have something I want you to see. Well, to be honest, Max, I'm a little pushed for time right now, so maybe you could catch me at my next signing. Judging by your last a turnout, I don't think that's possible. I'll take my chances now. Well, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed. I know you want to find them as much as I do. Okay, Max. what is it that you have for me that's so important? Redemption, vindication, and the ending to your next bestselling book. And how are you going to achieve that? Well, by finding the man who's responsible for these terrible murders. I mean, look at it this way. Tom Dempsey, the man who proved the existence of the infamous Redwood killer. We know what the local community thinks about your theories. You're a joke to them. I can change all that. So is this gonna take long? I'm supposed to be meeting friends for dinner, so... Not long. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Come on Max. Max. I'm in here. So, who's the couple in the photos? It's my sister's house. She's visiting friends with her husband. I'm taking care of the place. Huh. Interesting house. It's quiet. Just the way I like it. So Max, is this gonna take much longer? I really do have to get back. Jesus! Christ, you scared the shit out of me. What is this? Some kind of joke? Is that what I think it is? I thought you'd never ask. She's impressive. She should be. She's my daughter. Okay, so just let me do all the talking. Okay? We really don't want to piss her off. Laura, we need to talk. There's something I need to show you. Not interested. Look, I just need five minutes of your time. Will you at least hear me out? Please? Now what? Stay here. Please? Now can we talk? And I thought I was obsessed. Where did he say he found it? Oh, here near the old abandoned junk yard. We searched that area multiple times. If it was there, we would have found it. Well, you obviously didn't look hard enough. Why is he even here? Because he found the mask. Maybe he can help us find the killer. It's that simple, is it? Some asshole that you don't even know shows up with this piece of shit and you automatically think that it's real? Have you lost your fucking mind? Oh, it's real. Oh, and you just found it lying about. How convenient. It matches the description. So what, what difference does it make? Sarah's dead. Dad, I'm sorry, but it's time to move on. Well, I can't. Okay? I'm surprised that you can. You know what? That's not fair. Your right. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. It's just we've come so far. We've covered so much ground over the years and we're close. I can feel it. The mask was found here. Not only corroborates what Pamela said happened to her and her friends, but it also means we're dealing with a real person, a serial killer. Okay, let's just, let's just say for argument's sake that I believe all of this bullshit. Do you think he's just going to be sitting there waiting for us to find him? I mean, whoever did this as long gone by now. What if he's not? Hmmm? Don't you think we owe it to your sister to at least try. I have to agree with your dad on that. You know, if I wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it. Just keep out of this. What if they've just all been looking in the wrong places? What if, what if this thing was just branching out from one specific location? Something that we missed. This is ridiculous. You're not going back out there. What's the one place that we've never been allowed to search? Oh, no. Not gonna happen. It's the only thing that makes any sense. What's he talking about? He's talking about an old abandoned RAF base at the far end of the forest that our hero here got himself locked up for two weeks the last time that he pulled this stunt on trespass charges. Let me try again. It's a two day trek. You'll never make it. Not alone he won't. Oh no. Don't even think about it. No way. He found that with the mask. I can assure you, it's quite real. What more proof do you need? I'm not going back out there. I'm sorry. I just need you to trust me one more time. Regardless of whether you believe he exists or not, because I can't do this without you. Max, it's Tom. Good news, she's in. Meet us at the Redwood trail, tomorrow six a.m. Max, make sure you come prepared. Looks like I'm going to have to leave you. Can't thank you and your wife enough for your first-class hospitality. Truly has been a pleasure. Hey, look at me. I said look at me. I'm doing this to honor her. So I took the Liberty of repacking your bag. Are you sure you've done this before? Can't say that I was impressed. You went through my stuff? Like I said, I don't know you and I certainly don't trust you, but on this trip you listen to me because I'm in charge. Whatever you say. Great. Are you looking for this? Like I said, I don't trust you. It's for protection. Don't worry. We've got that covered. So you all set? What did she mean by that? You really didn't think we'd come out here alone, did you? Don't worry, Max. You're gonna love him. We lost already. Problem? No, no problem. Just a shortcut. I suggest you change your footwear. Why? How you doing, Max? Did tell you to come prepared. Well, if I would've known we'd be crossing streams. I would've brought something. Ah, come on, a little cold water is not gonna hurt a tough guy, like you. Ha ha ha. Should've been here by now. Hey. I see you took the scenic route. You know me. Just trying to keep it interesting. Probably took a shortcut. Hey, don't blame me. She's the boss. I just do as I'm told. I see you're still fucking with the new guys. Good to see you. Jen it's been too long. Thank you so much for doing this. You know me, Tom, I'll never stop looking. Besides sounds like this trip is gonna be a little different. We hope so. So that's the mysterious Max. You never told me how hot he was. Hi, I'm Jennifer. Welcome to the team. You guys do know that even if we don't find anything else, that mask is enough to get the police involved again. I promise you we'll go straight to the police as soon as we get back. Can I see it? So it fits the description perfectly. I mean, we're pretty certain, it's the real deal. Or so my father believes so. I'm not so certain. Jesus, this is fucked up. What is it? Stay here. Almost had you, Laura. You're getting sloppy, girl. You're getting loud. Oh, I think you broke my fucking nose. Good. Better than your fucking neck. You little Badger. Get over here and give big Gus a hug. Back together again, just like old times. That's what I'm afraid of. You know, I'm not as stealthy as I used to be. Yeah, I can smell that bad cologne like a mile away. Look who I found loitering in the forest. There he is. Late as always. Hey, if I started turning up early, you'd get suspicious. Who the hell is this guy? That's our protection. Jennie, baby. You are a sight for sore eyes, girl. You got that right. You feel good? You been working out? I have, thank you. And I know what you're thinking. Don't, ain't gonna happen. I understand, I understand. You're afraid you're gonna fall in love with me. It's understandable. Tom, how you doing, man? I like the hair. It's good to see you, Gus. Hey, where's the rest of the group? We're all that's left. You know, it kind of feels like no one cares anymore. Well, shit, man. I'm glad I brought a few of my good friends with me to even out the odds. Shit. Please tell me you didn't. You better believe it, baby. Big Bubba wasn't staying home for this party. Jesus Christ, Gus. You are one crazy son of a bitch. You get caught with that thing, you are on your own. He's the one that said come prepared. It's getting a little out of hand. It's Gus. What do you expect? You must be Max. I don't know, Tom. Looks a little shady if you ask me. It's funny. Tom never mentioned you at all. Play nice, Gus. He's one of the team. Are you, pretty boy? Are you one of the team? Oooh, got a tough guy here, huh? You trust him, Tom? He is the reason we're all here I said do you trust him? Yeah. I trust him. Well then it's all right by me, huh? Make no mistake about it, pretty boy. I'm gonna be watching you. All right, enough of the macho bullshit. Come on. We gotta get going. Just fucking with him. Jeez, when did you get so serious? You're such an asshole. Hey, I've got something even bigger than this if you're interested. Yeah, right. Come on, talk to me. Gus. Let me show you my etchings. Man. You're so disgusting, Gus. Party time. Gus, glad to see your tradition of not bringing a tent is still going strong. Bag of guns, box of condoms. All I need for this trip. And before you ask, yes, I plan on using them. Remind me again why we keep inviting this guy? We'll camp here for the night. Let's try and get some rest. We leave at sunrise. Why does it always have to be so early? You okay? Sure. We just need to make up for lost time tomorrow. We should hit the base by midday if we can pick up the pace. Where's Gus? I don't know. He was right here a second ago. Campers. Don't worry about the Durham ravine. I've never seen 'em in this far before. Seems like we're not the only ones who want to meet the boogeyman. Interesting choice for a gun. She may be old, but Mary Lee, she goes everywhere I go. It's sort of a tradition now. Mary Lee. Yeah, she's cold. She's precise. You get in her way, she'll blow your fucking head off. I named her after my ex-wife. But don't you worry. I got ma and pa for backup just in case. On that note, I'm going to bed. You keep the bed warm. I'll be in in a minute. I love a woman who plays hard to get. Makes me horny. So what's your story. Read your dad's book and found the story intriguing. Just, you know. Cut the bullshit. My dad may have bought your crap, but I don't buy it for a second. Why are you really here, Max. My brother went missing out here. Went into this forest about two years ago and never came back. I heard about this group of family members that never gave up the search. Read your dad's book, made the connection. Thought I oughta help. Here I am. I'm just like you. Just want answers. Why didn't you say anything? You never asked. You sure you know what you're getting yourself involved with? Are you? Sleep tight. I thought this was supposed to be a military base. She's right, Tom. We must have made a wrong turn back there. What do you think? I'm thinking this shouldn't be here. We still have four miles to go. Max, don't. This is it. Stay here. I'll check it out. There's nobody here. This place is empty. He's right. This place has been abandoned for years. It doesn't make any sense. This can't be the base. It's not. Then where the hell is it? We're standing on it? Whoo! Jackpot, baby. What the hell am I looking at? It's the way in. Way into what? Base is underground. This shit just got real. Somebody left the back door open. She'll be fine. She's not the one I'm worried about. Laura, everything okay? I'm fine. Just stay up there. Hey, guys! Hey, I'm locked in here. Oh, shit. Boogey boogey. Jesus Christ, Gus. You scared the shit out of me. No way you're gonna have all the fun down here by yourself, baby? I'm coming with you. No, no, no. It automatically locks. That was close. What the hell is this place? I don't know, but I heard something from down there. Just hearing things. This is a bad idea. We should just go. I'm not coming all the way out here and leaving empty handed. Goddamn it, Gus. I thought you said this place was abandoned. It is. Then how come the lights are on? Good question. I knew I should've brought Big Bubba. What do you think? I think we should go back and get the others first. Come on, I got this. Ladies first. What the hell is this? What the hell? You gotta come see this. That's a human eyeball. What is this? That's a human dick. I think it's time to go. It might be the others. What if it's not? Stay here. It's okay, it's all clear. Just an old door. You think that's what you heard last time? I don't know. I think so. I hope so. All right, we've got something here. What the hell is this? What the fuck is all this? There's blood on this. I've seen this guy. He's been missing for years. Whoa man. Check out the background. What do you think? You got ma and pa? Yeah. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. It's us. I thought I told you to stay outside. We can't find Max. What do you mean you can't find him? He followed you down. We couldn't stop him. Laura, he was acting really strange. What is all this? You were right, Tom. You were right about everything. Protection. What the hell am I going to do with this? Have you lost your mind? You're right. What was I thinking? You happy? Just point and shoot. You understand? What the hell's going on? You just stay close to me. You'll be fine, I promise you. Wait. What was it that you guys saw in the other room? You don't want to know? Why would Max do that? If it wasn't him, somebody else closed that door. We have to keep moving forward. There's gotta be another exit. You've seen what's back there. I don't think we have a choice. I have something for you. A gift. Now you can be complete again. I'm looking forward to meeting you in person. No, no, please, please. No, no, please. Please don't. No, please. No. No, please. No, please, no! Shit. This is no military bunker. This is some kind of underground prison. Yeah, but for who? Jesus. This place is huge. What are you thinking, Laura? I'm thinking we need to make sure we're alone before we go any further. What the fuck? Holy shit. Why would they build this underground? Who knows? Whatever they were doing here, they didn't want anyone to know. My thoughts exactly. Where are you? All right, we got something. We got something. We something going on. All right. It's a fucking graveyard up here. This isn't a prison. We got bodies everywhere. You're not gonna believe what I found in this folder. What the fuck is that? These guys didn't stand a chance. Fuck. What a way to go. That's him. Isn't it? Well? I don't understand it. What am I even looking? It looks like they were experimenting on these things. What the fuck is that? This whole place is it's some kind of experimental hospital. What are you saying? I'm saying, I think we may have found our killers. Government's been doing shit like this for years. They all have military IDs too. Look, read it. It's all in the documents. What about all these bodies? What happened to all the patients? You okay. What do you think? I know this is messed up, but we're gonna get out of this. I promise you. No one knows we're down here, Gus. Hey, I'll shoot my way out of here if I have to. You know me, Gus, I need your help. Just give me a second. Sit tight, get your shit together. I'm gonna get us out. Jennifer. Jennifer. Max? Max? Jennifer. Max? All right, go ahead and try it. Most of the breakers are shot. If this place goes dark, we're in trouble. Backup power is the best we're gonna do. Hey, we need to find a communication's room. There's gotta be a hard line to the outside world. How much longer before we lose light completely? It's hard to tell. That hunk of junk up there's a diesel engine. Somebody been keeping it going. Hey! Okay, that's messed up. She couldn't have gone far. Forget about her. We got her own problems. She might know the way out. Yeah. She also might be responsible for that guy hanging on that chain. Fuck her and fuck Max. Max, what the fuck is going on? Max, what the fuck are you doing to me? Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. Fuck. You should feel honored. I wanted you to be the first. What the fuck are you talking about? I wonder what he'll do to you. So many wonderful possibilities. No, please. Please, please. I'm not the one you have to worry about. Don't worry. I'll be watching. No, Max, please. Please help me. Max, please, come back. Please. Please, come back. Don't leave me here, please. Max, come back. Please help me. Please, I won't say anything. I promise. Oh, no. Oh God. No, God. What's your name? Donna. Donna Ingram. Donna, I'm Laura. And this is Gus. Please, you gotta get me out of this place. Okay, you're safe now. Just take a deep breath. Just try and relax. How'd you find this place? We were just camping. He killed my husband. Who did? You really have no idea, do you? You're going to die down here. What do you think? You believe that bullshit? I don't know, I don't know what to believe anymore. We can't trust that crazy lady. She's lying. Maybe she's just scared. You tell me. Who's camping with high heels on? Oh shit. Why would she lie? There's always one way to find out. I knew we should've brought more guns. Max. Where the hell have you been? You seen the others? You okay. Max, talk to me. Max. Laura? Come on, Gus, you big beautiful crazy fuck, what have you got for me? Fuck. Jen. Fuck. Get it together, Tom, get it together. You sure you can get that thing to work? It might take a while. This thing's old. I should be able to get this thing up and running if the power holds. I'm gonna go back and get the others. Okay? Dad? Please be advised, unauthorized use of this terminal is a federal offense. Please be advised. Hello. Is there... Fuck. Shit. Fuck! I want you to see something. I booked the best seats in the house just for you. This is gonna be glorious. Incredible, isn't he? Stay with me. It's an inspiring choice of weapon. You oughta be taking notes. Come on. Keep watching, keep watching. Don't want to miss a thing. That's all the details. Wow. What a beautiful death. You ought to be proud of that. So what now, you sick fuck? Honestly, I haven't decided yet. Why should he have all the fun, right? I mean, after all, I have still have your moron of a friend to offer to him. I'm gonna enjoy watching that fool die. Mind you? Not as much as watching Jennifer being gutted like the pig she was. Ah, you didn't know about that, did you? Whoops. Spoiler alert. She kept begging me to let her go. Quite pathetic. That slut got what she deserved. Your dad, on the other hand, I felt bad for him. Imagine having a daughter that doesn't believe you. It's quite pathetic. Fuck you. You caused him much more pain than I ever could. Guess we're not that different after all. Ah, ah. Careful, Laura. I don't want to shoot you, but I will. I just feel like your death should be a little bit more memorable. I mean a bullet, that's freaking impersonally. I really want you to enjoy it. Now, an ax. I think that would be great for both of us. Think I'm gonna start with your legs. You won't need them anyway, right? I feel sorry for you, Max. I didn't know you cared. I mean, by all means. Let me know why, I'm all ears. I've been on to you from the very beginning. You almost had me with that bullshit story about your missing brother. You didn't think that I actually believe that crap, did you? You don't know me. What I'm capable of. But you will. You're just another fucking fanboy wannabe with mommy and daddy issues. You're a joke. You know, I think I changed my mind. This gun will just do fine. I'm glad I amuse you. It's funny. What's so funny? That you think that gun's actually loaded. Take care. Max. Remember, try and enjoy it. It's all in the details. What a mess. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. You showed such promise. Who are you? Now, Max. I've been following your career for years. Even thought about you for the program. Bit you just haven't quite met my expectations and you know, your time is up. What a waste? He's all yours. Beautiful. Laura? Shit. Gus? Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? This is a secure line. How did you access this terminal? 'Cause I'm trapped in your fucking underground prison. Pleas, we need help. My friends are dying down here. That would be the property of the US Defense Department. Trespassing is a criminal offense. Fuck your trespass. If you want to arrest me, come down here and fucking get me. Please stand by. Miss, what is your name? My name is Laura Dempsey. Laura, I want you to listen to me very carefully. I want you in any of your colleagues to exit the building immediately. Do you understand? We are locked in here. Do you not speak fucking English? We need help please. Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Shit. Hello? Oh shit. Who are you? Jen? Jen? Kill me, kill me! I'm standing here. I'm here, standing. Show yourself, motherfucker! You fucking piece of pigshit. I got nothing left. I'm hunting you, motherfucker. Big Bubba wants to say hi. Where the hell are you? Laura. Gus! Fuck. You wanna get close and make this personal, motherfucker? You wanna go man on man? Or man against whatever the fuck you are. Bring it. Stay right there. Hey! Try coming back from that, motherfucker. You know, you're one crazy bitch. I had the whole thing under control. Had him right where I wanted him. So now what? Now we go home. Laura Dempsey? I'm the one you spoke to. Where are the others? They're dead. They're all dead. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. What a mess. Secure the asset and get this place cleaned down. We're moving the entire program to the Nevada compound. Hear that, baby, we're going to Vegas. Mama needs a new pair of shoes.
