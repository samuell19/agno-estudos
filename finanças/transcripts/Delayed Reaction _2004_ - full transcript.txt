Good day, Shisho. - Hi, Menny. Took you quite a while. Did you go daisy-picking on the way? I don't remember having a greenhouse. A lot of people. Sure the moment they hear a war's coming, they all come here. Good luck, bro. Tear the place up. Welcome to the end of the world - beginning of the war party. Do you know the one about the gambler whose mother used to wake him up every morning? She'd say: "Danny, Get up. It's 10." So he'd answer: "Your 10 and my 50..." Marcelle, you're the prettiest of them all... I didn't believe these Americans would start the war. I'm telling you. Nothing will happen here. These Americans with their weapons... If one missile falls here, everything'll change. Don't worry. Nothing will fall here. I love your self-confidence. Can we get back to the game? - Speak. Cards? I'm opening with 1000. - Menny. - 60,000. Here you go, Menny... That's all right, Menny. - You win. Have you got a pen? - I'm your man. You're always welcome here, you know, Menny. - Enjoy, guys. You surprised me. - I made a promise, didn't I? Everyone's leaving the country. How come you're coming back? They said we'd have chemicals, so I came. It's good to see you. We don't have any plastic sheeting. Forget that. That's unnecessary. That's unnecessary. Forget that. Did you see my hands shaking? Menny? Menny! - Come on up, Shisho. Stop screaming. Come on up. Good morning. Are you awake yet? Got yourself together? Want some coffee? I can't even move a finger, Shisho. Didn't sleep, eh? - Yep. No one showed up to clean the club this morning. - I'm not surprised. What do we do, Menny? Take a day off. Spend it in bed, Shisho. Alright, you're the boss. You do not think I am going to clean the place myself... Take a look at me, will you Shisho? I haven't slept a wink all night. You're breaking my heart. Go on, get up. - I'm getting up. Get up. Get up. - Let me sleep... - Get up! We have work to do! You're so fucked up... I don't give a shit about the club. I'm going home to rest. Go on. Clean up the club. - You clean up the club. The Commander-in-Chief of the French army says, that Iraq is incapable of launching a significant chemical attack against Coalition forces, beacuse the launching sites for the weapons were initially among the primary targets of the attack... Karin? What are you doing? - Making breakfast. Come here, will you? Good morning. - Good morning. How are you? Good. I thought you'd disappeared. - I didn't. Will you let me get up and make breakfast? I don't know what I would've done without you last night. Who's thinking about last night? I'm thinking about how we'll make it tonight. You've sealed off a serious anti-chemical room, haven't you? I've brought you some good sedatives. Thanks. Say, isn't it a shame, spending all that money on recordings, now that the club's closed anyway? Shisho, soon everyone will crawl out of their holes and come dancing. No one's coming out of their hole. Home Front Command issued an order that no mass events are to be held. No one's coming out of their hole, Menny. You just take care of our gigs, Shisho, and I'll take care of Home Front Command, all right? And what about the money you owe me? What's up with you? - Nothing. I want the money you owe me. I'll get you the money I owe you on the first. - Scout's honor? Scout's honor. Scout's honor. - Scout's honor? - Yes. - OK. You should be ashamed of yourself. Cast your mind back. Go to age 12. Open every page, every chapter. Tell me: Have I ever let you down? Hello. - Hello Shisho. Shaul? What's up, bro? Working at the bank today? - Of course we're working. Nice. What about the missiles? Missiles or not, the work's got to be done. Gambling? - What are all these cheques for? Menny takes care of those matters. Here you go. It's Shaul from the bank Hey, Shaul, what's up? Alright. Menny, tell me about these cheques. Look, I'm running a business here. I have expenses. What do you want? A hundred thousand shekels is supposed to be an expence? It's a down payment for my new kitchen. I you don't deposit a hundred thousand by this afternoon, I'm bouncing the cheques. - Listen... Menny, deposit before noon, or I'll bounce the cheques. All right, Shaul, I'll make a deposit. I'm counting on you Menny, do it before noon. All right. Say Shaul, what happened to you guys? You used to be this country's oxygen, and now you're suffocating us. Bastard. I'm going to take care of some business at the bank, Shisho. I'll be back later, all right? What's up, Simon. It's Menny. All right. Thanks. Say, can I come over and see you for a minute? I need a little something. Really little. You sure? All right. I'm coming over. Bye. Something. Hello. - Daddy, this is Tessie. - Tessie darling, what's up? I got lost on the daytrip to Auschwitz. Let me have the emergency number of the tour guide. - Where in Auschwitz? At the crematorium... no, by the shoes. All right, but are you by the crematories or by the shoes? At the public phone by the shoes. All right, all right, sweetie. Stay there. Don't move. Relax. I'm taking care of things. Stay on the line with me. - I'll hold. - All right. Hello, this is Simon, Tessie's father. Your daughter got lost. - Right. - We don't know where she is. She's by the shoes. - By the shoes? - Yes. - I can see her. - So go see her. Alright, I'm coming up to her. Can you see her? - Yes, yes, I can see her by the shoes. Calm her down. - I can see her, I'll calm her down. - All right. Mr. Ben-Bassat, don't worry, I will calm her down. - All right. All right. Tessie, darling. Can you see them? - Yes, thank you. Great. Great, sweetie. I love you. - I love you too. Dad, say hi to everybody. - I'll say hello. Kisses. - Great, darling. Have a nice time. - Yes Dad, I will enjoy myself. Kisses. Bye. - Bye. I'll give you 7000 dollars for the watch. Why 7000 dollars? It's a real antique watch. 7000 dollars. Whatever. Tell me about London. A lot of good-Iooking guys there. More pasta? - Yeah. It's good. - Eat a lot. It'll make you strong. Since when do you know how to make pasta? I learned how to make it in London, but don't get used to it, sweety. Pasta. In London. - Yes. - Cheers. To pasta. - To me. Yes. To pasta. And Londoners. - To what's coming after the pasta. What's coming after the pasta? Did you know that marathon runners take... Have pasta before they run marathons? - Why? They need their energy, don't they? Carbohydrates. So eat up, darling, we're having a marathon later. Will that be a long one or a short one? Missiles incoming! Missiles incoming! 7 casualties, all lightly wounded by the missiles that hit at night... Shhh... Everything's all right. - Call a doctor. Darling, it'll be all right. Relax. - I want an ambulance. Call a doctor. Try to relax. Take a pill... Take a pill. What do you feel? - I don't know. What are you thinking about? What are you thinking about? About some missile falling on us and killing us. Menny! What's up with you? I don't know. Haven't got the faintest. It's as if my body's sensing something and I don't know what it is. The pill will help you in a moment. - Should I take another? Soon. You have to wait a little. There. You look better already. Come, come, darling. Shhh... I haven't seen you eat anything for a week now. I had some cake today. Honey, why don't you see a doctor? What? A doctor? What's up with you? You really wear me out. You're so jumpy. I can't see you this way. Just go see a general practitioner. He'll refer you. I'll go see a doctor after the war, all right? All right. So I'll take my stuff and move to my parents for the meantime. What happened? - I don't want to see you breaking down. What do you mean, "breaking down"? Me, break down? You think I'll break down? I'm a tiger. That's what I am. What are you afraid of? What am I afraid of? We've been there already. I know what I'm afraid of. Before we broke up, when we were still together, and you did that gig up north, and that crashed down, and you lost all your money, and we waited here at home, shivering with fear, not knowing if friends or creditors were knocking on our door. - Stop it. I won't go back there. You became a different person. You wouldn't let me help you. Do you know how frustrating that is? I'll see a doctor, all right? You can't play games with your health, you know. I think I'll be going home, Shisho. No way. We promised a gig. Get up there and do it. I'm not going to play for 20 people. What's up with you? Take a valium and relax. - What do you mean? I don't take pills. You wanted this gig. You shouldn't disrespect 20 people. 20 people showed up. Get up there and do it. I'm not disrespecting 20 people, Shisho. I just don't feel like playing. We sold tickets. Get up there and do it. Do you want me to play, Shisho? - I want you to perform. You want me to play, Shisho. - I want you to play. Come on, let's do it. Come on, let's do it. Koby! I can't eat. You've got to eat, Menny. That's what the doctor said. I can't. Someone's calling me. Hold on, Menny. Where are you going? Menny? Who's calling you? - Someone's calling me. Relax, Menny. Come, Menny. You're dreaming. No one's calling you. Come, darling. Take off... your shirt. Come on, help me, Menny. Come on. You've got to sleep. You've got to rest. Come on, darling. Get in bed. Everything's all right. I'm here. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'd like some coffee, please. Everything all right, man? Are you all right? Come on, have some water. Have some water. Hey, hey... Wake up, wake up... Drink some water. Drink. Drink. Great. Are you all right? I'm not getting any air. I'm not getting any air. Come on. Let's step outside. Breathe some air. You all right? Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. No. Everything's all right. Everything's all right. Come on. Don't give up. Don't give up. They're coming for us. Don't give up. No, no, no. You're dreaming, man. It's in your head. It's in your head. He lost his eyes. He lost his eyes completely. Geez, relax. Enough. Relax. Relax. I'm all right, I'm all right. - You're all right. This is what I've got. Hello. - Shisho? Karin. - What's up Karin? - Where's Menny? Menny? He hasn't been home yet today? - No. He hasn't come home yet. You don't say! He's not home yet? - I don't know where he is. Alright, but I'm sure you know where he hangs out. He's probably out gambling somewhere. Gambling. - Why are you so surprised? Yes, he's gambling. You're really helping me out. Alright, Karin, he'll probably come around here later. All right, Shisho, call me up the moment he gets there, understand? Yes, alright. Bye bye. - Bye. Who's available on King George? Number 47, go to 50 Rashi street... 13 to 1. How about if I go straight to the airport? Turn off the radio. - I can't. It's my job. Turn off the radio. The enemy's listening. Turn off the radio. I turned it off. Money, money, money, money. I want money, Simon. A lot of money. Got money? You can have my apartment if you want it. Give me... Money, money, money, money. I want money, Simon. A lot of money. You can have my apartment if you want it, just give me the money. Give me. Give me money. Come on... Give me. Give me money. Come on... I want money, Simon. Money. Everything all right, Menny? - Give me money, Simon. Money. Money... Money... You... you and you, come with me. Let's go. You reach the objective, deploy in a star-pattern ambush, and if nothing's happening, you get back up. Good luck, good luck... Good luck Koby. I'm with you. Get me out of here. Let me go. You want money, don't you? Let me make one phone call. One phone call to take care of everything. The goal was empty. Empty was the goal. He kicks the ball over the ambulance. He kicks back. It removed its star of David. You call that a player? Look here, nowadays, bad luck simply doesn't exist. Soccer means tactics... Bastards. You're all bastards... Sometimes people get stressed out. We're only human, after all. You're all bastards. You bastards. You... I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this! Let me out of this place... What time is it? - Around five. It's morning. Guess I'll be going. I left Shiri at home. Go on. I'll let you know if anything develops. - Yes. You can see Doctor Ofer now. Yes? Hello. I'm Karin, Menny's girlfriend. His ex-wife. - Have a seat please. What's... What's going on with him? How's he feeling? - Look, Karin. He arrived with a very acute seizure. He's sleeping now. When he gets up, we'll see what we can do. Can I just go in and see him? No, no, no. It's not customary for relatives to see their acquaintances in rooms. But when he wakes up, we'll see. If seeing him is a possibility, we'll let you know. Shall I wait then? - I... don't think there's any use in waiting. It won't take a day. It may take a day or two, a week... Possibly a month. He'll be all right, won't he? Menny's a strong young man. Seems to be a strong young man. I'll be back tomorrow morning, thank you. Just don't let it fall on me... Just don't let it fall on me... All right. I think you should take him to the room. Medications! Batsheva, Batsheva. Bandits! - Saleem, Saleem. Good morning! Bandits! Ruthie... - Good morning. Didi, Menash... Didi. - I took some too. Good morning. To your health. Medications! Didi, Menash... Sherman, Ricky, Aviyah... How are you feeling, Menny? I wanna go home. Well. We'll be seeing each other during the week. Hello? He's tall. Really tall. You're a pilot. I know you. You're a pilot. My father was a pilot. You're a basketball player, aren't you? Do you know me? You're a pilot. - Got some cigarettes? - No, no. He shouldn't smoke... - No, he's... You're an El-AI pilot. He's a pilot. Aren't you? You're a pilot, aren't you? Hello? Are you a basketball player? - Are you a pilot? Why aren't you answering? - Do I know you? Faster, faster. Walk faster. Faster. Walk faster here... - Do I know you? He knows me... - Why is he walking so slowly? He's walking slowly... - Are you Jewish? You Jewish? I'm from room number 8. - He's a socialist. "...and the truth just comes out". Mordechai, do you remember Greta Garbo? And Mordechai, do you remember Ingrid Bergman? I remember. I remember everything. Good morning! - Shraga, - Parasites! Shraga, stop it. Shraga, listen... - Communists! - Shraga... Hi. What's up? We don't know. He's resting for now. Do you want to give him the package? I'll see to it that he gets it. - Great. I've decided to shut down the club. What happened? - I can't take this pressure anymore. What pressure? - What pressure? What pressure? Paying rent, mortgage, municipal taxes, salaries, paying providers... You have to pay this, you have to pay that, pay, pay, pay... Where from? Don't they understand that something happened? Couldn't you wait for Menny to get better? I couldn't wait a minute, Karin. Couldn't wait a minute. I'm breaking down. I'm breaking down. What about all the money Menny invested in the club? I sold all the gear. I paid the workers. All the money he owed. I also took what he owed me. There's some money left. Here you go. Give it to him, when he'll feel better. That's what's left. It was easy for you, making a decision about Menny's money. It's not a matter of money, Karin. It's a matter of responsibility. Responsibility. - I thought you guys were friends. What did you think? Nothing. I'm going to Amsterdam with Shiri. We have tickets. Amsterdam. I'll move on. Shiri's in the car. Make sure he gets the package, all right? Do me a favor, Karin. Tell him I love him, will you? Tell him I think about him. I really think about him. I think about him a lot. You tell him that. Bye. I won't cry, I won't cry. Give me a cigarette. Don't have one. Give me a cigarette. He gave me a cigarette. He gave me a cigarette. He gave me a cigarette. He gave me a cigarette. He gave me a cigarette. He gave me a cigarette. What's up, Ruthie? Everything fine? Menny, you've got visitors. Look at the new one. Look at the new one. Look at the new one. Come on. Just look. He looks like a real bastard, that new guy. You know, I'm the messiah, and I ain't gonna heal him... I brought you some things from home. Get me out of here. I don't want to be here. They have a great team of doctors here. I'm sure they'll let you go soon. Didn't you hear what I said? Call the High Court of Appeals, the Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister and tell them what they're doing to me. Look at my hands shaking. They're killing me with these pills. Menny, it's going to take a while. Get me out of here. It's enough. I've been here for a week. No, Menny. You've been here nearly a month. Liar. You're a liar. A liar, that's what you are! Are you collaborating with them? - You know I'm not. Don't you dare touch me. Don't you dare touch me. Whore! You whore! Go away and don't ever come near me again. Go and don't come back! Liar, whore! Whore. She just clung to me. Liar... Everything's going to be all right. You have nothing to worry about. He's going to be all right. Could you give him this, please? - Yes. Sure. - Thanks. They have shitty food here! - Why are you screaming? You're lucky they had to restrain me for like 2 weeks, 'cause I'm the violent type. So you'd better watch out, nigger. Allah Akbar! - Arab nigger! He gave me a cigarette. He gave me a cigarette. It's going to be tasty now... Now, it's going to be tasty. Check out the shell-shocked guy... He can't drink water. It's the pills. Try to sweat them out. That's what I do. Good morning! - Come with me. Come with me. Hello? Got a light? Hello? I don't have to take any more pills. I knew they'd realize it. I'm telling you, they put me in here by mistake. I'll never commit suicide. Never, ever commit suicide. I have everything. Everything I want. Everything. Anyway, I'm sure they'll let me go soon. I have everything I want. Everything. Anything I want. I'll never commit suicide. I'm going for a smoke. Menny? Menny! That's it for today. One more and I'm done. Verdi. 4 letters. Shraga, a Verdi opera. 4 letters. - Aida. Aida. - That's right. I just love Nachman Shai. I was a little boy in the ghetto. It was at the end of the war and then they started bombing us. They bombed us endlessly. Day and night. Day and night. A week or two. I don't remember. I was a kid. I was with my mother all the time. We sat there in the shelter. I think we didn't even leave it to pee. There was nothing to eat. I don't remember what we ate. And we just sat there. And the city was shaken violently. The bombing was so intense. We thought the house would collapse any minute and we didn't believe we'd come out alive. When it was finally over, we went out to the street. I asked my mother: "Mommy, where are we?" Because I didn't recognize anything. Anything. Menny. Menny. I'm coming to take you for a CT tomorrow morning. Menny! Menny... Sons of bitches! - Menny, it's dangerous. Come down. - Sons of bitches. Don't scream. Everyone will come here now. Come down, Menny. It's dangerous, Menny. - I don't care. Come down, Menny. Menny. Come down. You think you're the only one who's suffering, Menny? You think I didn't want to commit suicide? I did. But did I get anything from that? Nothing. Only more suffering. Believe me, Menny. Menny, if they find out you ran away from me, they'll fire me. Menny. Stop it! Move it, will you? I'll show you... Don't you dare touch me anymore! - Come, come! Why'd you use the cold water? - You won't hurt anyone anymore. Why'd you use the cold water? Why'd you use the cold water? Why'd you use the cold water? I have this paper and pencil here. I'd like you to write me something. Write. Anything you like. Anything that comes into your head. Tell me about your childhood, your school, um... about your parents, your friends, your wife. Ex-wife... Whatever you want, actually. Just write. Here, have a go. - My hands are shaking. - You'll get over it. There you go. I'll try. Horse. Pretty horse. Butterfly. - Little butterfly. Didi, why don't you hang the pictures on the wall? Give me a cigarette. I gave you everything I had. I ran out. I don't have any more to give out. Sit down, Ricky. Sit down. You don't have to give everyone everything. You have to leave some for yourself as well. I'm depressed. Hug me. This is a treat. I love homemade food. Remember what a great cook my mother was? - Of course. My father was so happy when I'd come over for dinner Friday nights. I miss them a lot. Eat. They lowered my medication dosage. Look, my hands aren't shaking as bad. 10:30 AM. I'd like to repeat this morning's cheering item. You may leave the sealed rooms. A discussion took place this morning in the chief of staff's bureau, following the suspension of fighting in the Gulf... - Good morning! Therefore, Israeli army spokesperson announced that citizens should pack... Got a cigarette? That's it. I've come to say goodbye. I think they're going to let me go home in the beginning of the week. I'm happy for you. I hope you'll see the light too, as soon as possible. Do you think my parents will accept me? Of course they'll accept you. They're your parents. But they're so religious. Don't worry. Batsheva? You have an amazing voice. Thanks. What are you doing?! You're still alive? You're an Arab! You're an Arab too. I'd throw you both in an oven. You'd come out as baked Arab bread. No... No... No injections. No injections! No injections... Shraga. - Faggots! - Will you listen to me? Bandits! Stand up, stand up. I told you! Didn't I tell you? I told you not to step. Not to step, and you... I told you! Hello, doctor. - Hello. Have a seat. And what about me, doctor? How come I'm still here in the closed ward? I feel just fine. - You feel fine now, but when you came here, your condition was very grave. I know, doctor. I've spent a long time here. And don't you want to know what happened to you? What's going on with you? What's going on with you now? I feel completely healthy. Are you healthy? - Almost healthy. Well, then. That's it for today. What do you mean? That's it. That's it. That's it. - Why? I can't help you, understand? I can't help you. Do you want to help me? - I always want to help you. But I need you to talk in order to help and you're not talking. You're keeping everything to yourself. Stir it and lower the fire, Stir again and the soup is ready. If you'll have any problems, call me. What's up? - It's Batsheva. She's not taking her pills. "If you'd just let me get a little closer, "be by your side, be on my own. "I shut my eyes. I see you. "...and the truth just comes out "Like you always say... "Look at me. Be with me... I think you can take Batsheva back to her room. That's against regulations. I make the rules. If you put it that way... Camilla, call an ambulance. Batsheva committed suicide. Hello. I need an ambulance. You can go to sleep now. Please go to your rooms. What happened? What happened? We can go to sleep now. We can go to sleep now. I asked you to go to your rooms, didn't I? Go to your rooms. Go to your rooms, everybody. Everything's all right. You can go to sleep. Sleep. Go back to sleep, please. Go to your room. Go on. Go back to your room. Saleem, go to your room. Go to your room, please. "As long as I still have hope, love". "As long as I still have joy, I have hope..." Let's talk, doctor. It happened just before we finished our army service. A team went out to set up this area where a terrorist squad was supposed to try and infiltrate. Our mission was to set up explosives in Wadi Muzlem. It's a valley where terrorist squads pass through all the time. Our team went out there and I was the team's commander. We reached the spot, laid down the explosives and the moment we turned around, there was this huge explosion. And huge bursts of fire were fired at us. I remember the smell of charred meat from that place. The screaming of the wounded. All the body parts scattered over the place. I remember Koby lying there on the ground, screaming: "Mother, mother. Save me." I couldn't do a thing! There was no one there but me! I grabbed the radio and yelled for an evacuation chopper. No one came. And I was alone there. They were shooting at us all the time. I couldn't even pick my head up! We were under constant fire. And everyone was screaming... And those little children were... screaming. I ran to Koby. His face was all bloody. I didn't even recognize him. I didn't... It took them an hour to evacuate us. There was nothing to evacuate, because everyone was dead, except me. I hate myself for staying alive, while they didn't, doctor. What about Koby? Koby's blind. Is he alive? He's alive. I couldn't help him. I couldn't do a thing. Eight soldiers, doctor. Eight soldiers. It's the first time I'm talking about this. I've never talked to anyone about this. Koby, Koby. Haven't spoken to him in 10 years. Get your arm up. Go get Mordechay. We're going off to the city of Dervichen To buy a turkey. Carful coachman, the basket torn, the turkey will fly away. Hey, Menny, you'll come to my exhibition, won't you? Of course I will. Feel good. You're going. You're going. The Traveler's Prayer. The Traveler's Prayer. The Traveler's Prayer. Come on. Come on. "May it be Your will, Hashem, our God and the God of our ancestors, "that You lead us toward peace, guide our footsteps toward peace, "and make us reach our desired destination "for life, gladness, and peace. "May you rescue us from the hand of every foe..." Menny. All the best. - Thank you for everything. "...May You send blessing in our handiwork, and grant us grace, "kindness, and mercy in Your eyes... "...You are God Who hears prayer requests". Say amen. Menny. Let the people out there know that I'm here. - Feel good. The Traveler's Prayer. The Traveler's Prayer. Say goodbye to the righteous one. Goodbye, may God watch over you. Take care of yourself. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. The Traveler's Prayer. Feel good. I'm not pretty. - You're the prettiest woman in the world. You're Ricky. There's no one like you and there will never be. There's no one like me. There's no one like me. There's no one like me. There's no one like me. There's no one like me. Hug me. Give me a cigarette. There's no one like me. They went to the market. Who did they find? Me. Hug me. Give me a cigarette. There's no one like me They went to the market. Who did they find? Me. Ricky. Hug me. Give me a cigarette. There's no one like me. They went to the market. Who did they find? Me. Thank you. Illness summary form. Take this to the building across the way from this one. 2nd floor. Get it stamped and you'll get your release form. This is my referral form to the army's combat reaction department. Yoram will be waiting for you there on Monday. - OK. And that's it. All the best. Thank you, Dr Ofer. It's all on us. - Thank you for everything. Goodbye. Is it morning already? I'm thin, aren't I? You're a nerd. A nerd? - A nerd. Am I a nerd? - You're a nerd. Big time nerd. You're such a nerd. - I'll show you what a nerd I am. Why don't you show me what a nerd you are. Go on. Forget it. Forget it. It's all right. Forget it. I'll take care of it later. We'll have it with no sugar. Thanks. You hear everything, don't you? You learn to hear. It's nice here. - Yes. Did you see the entrance gate? Nice, isn't it? It's a very special gate. An antique gate. It's like 100 years old. It took me so long to get it and bring it over. Turns out to be 4 inches short of the ground. Whatever. We'll handle that too. So how are you, Menny? All right? As much as I can be. - Hard times? Times were hard. I'm better now. - Great. A good day. A smile replaces the pain. I can go on, free on a very narrow path, when the entire world's there forme. A good day. Devoid of dreams, or opinions about the issue that exhausts at the end of the day. The path is very narrow. The entire world's there for me... A good day. A smile replaces the pain. I can go on, free on a very narrow path, when the entire world's there for me. A good day. Devoid of dreams, or opinions about the issue that exhausts at the end of the day. The path is very narrow. The entire world's there for me... A good day. A smile replaces the pain. I can go on, free on a very narrow path, when the entire world's there forme. A good day.
