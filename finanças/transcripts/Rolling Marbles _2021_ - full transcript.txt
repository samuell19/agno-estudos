Wake up, breakfast's nearly ready. Mizuho? I said breakfast's nearly ready! - Mizuho! - Alright! Get up. Where are my glasses? - The usual place? - No, not there. They're in the bathroom, Mizuho. Thanks. Sort your rubbish out, you're in charge. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. Phew! Okay, let's eat! Bon app騁it! - This is good! - Delicious. Listen, guys. Last night in my dream, this place sang during dinner. This room? Yeah! It was a great tune so I'll make it into a song. You'll be in my video, you'll write a review. It might become a mega hit and I might perform at festivals! That's a rip-off. Well, I live here, don't I? What was it like? Something like... Nice. - You think? - Sweet. Okay, it'll be my new song. And my first music video. And the royalties will cover the rent. I'm glad I talked about my dream before I forgot it. It's a bit salty. - Yeah, a bit. - Right? She's not listening. - Have you tried this? - No. So good. With Shibuya being redeveloped, the apartment we're living in will be demolished, hence the cheap rent. This is the story of us during this limited time. Rolling Marbles Hi, guys. - Hello! - How's it going? All good! - 40 minutes. - Sure. Shiori! Here. You done? We'll be finished in 10 minutes.

Let the balloons take us home. You're too heavy for that. Excuse me? - Too many people. - Loads around. Oh no. Oh shit, oh shit... Are you gonna drink more? There's no damn way I'm stopping now! It's bad for your health. It's a form of self-harm, I know that. What about you, Ai? Some oolong tea for me. Listen Ai, you shouldn't be like that. - I mean... - Alright, alright. You're hammered.

Why me? What if a monster comes out? - It won't. - Who knows? A marble. It's chipped. Oh I put it in my pocket. You were the culprit then, Mizuho. Wow, it's beautiful. Hey, Mizuho, can I keep this? Can we meet up on Tuesday eve? Mizuho? What? Can I keep this? Sure, but it's chipped. I know, it's fine. I like it. Lucky you, I want one, too. You'll lose it, anyway. I won't! I love the smell. What? I love your scent. Stinky. Not to me, I love it. Detergent? No, it's not detergent. It's your scent. I also love your hands. Lovely hands. Yeah. Let me wrap my arms. That's what girls ask boys to do, normally. Because you make me totally relaxed. Do you say that to everyone? Never. Only you can make me relaxed, Mizuho. See? I'm relaxed. - Hello. - Hello. Use this if you like. Thank you. I'm Karen, 23 years old. I'll do my best, thank you. Okay, thank you. - Next, please. - Yes. I'm Ai, twenty years old. I'll do my very best. Thank you very much.

Okay, for smoking rooms, we have either with a reclining seat or a flat seat available. Can't you speak clearer? Oh excuse me, sir. We have either with a reclining seat or a flat seat available.

Okay. - Excuse me. - Sorry. Coming! Yes? - A delivery for you. - Thanks. Phew. What did we say to each other On the last day?

I'm home. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. Cr鑪e caramel again? Coz it's good. It's pretty late, overtime? Yeah. You must be tired. Wasn't today hot as hell? I heard it was the hottest day ever. They say that every year. Hey, how did your audition go, Ai? It went all right. Sounds good. I'm home. Welcome back. It's nearly ready. Sorry, can I skip breakfast? Why? You should eat something. I wanna lose weight for my next audition. Okay. No worries. I'm sorry. Listen, in my dream, this place was filled with earthworms. - Urgh, how disgusting. - I know! I asked you two to help me get rid of them, but you two went out to rent a DVD. I tried to pick them but they split in half and multiplied! Detergent's running low. - Are you listening? - Uh-huh. I could see there were adult worms and child worms. Seriously, there were earthworms everywhere in this entire room! Ai! The room full of earthworms! Yikes! - Mizuho! - Yes. Have you done the pick up? Oh... - The shooting's tonight. - C'mon. I'm sorry, I'll go now. - Move! - Go, go, go, go! It's about tomorrow's shift. I'm afraid I've got an audition. Yes, I can make it if the audition finishes early. I'm so sorry. Yes, thank you. Good bye. Yes. Um, I'm Ai, twenty years old. I'm not in agency right now. Uh... I'll do my very best. Thank you very much. - Okay then, take a seat. - Thank you. I'm going to ask you some questions, okay? What is your strength? Huh? Strength, things you can do better than anyone. My strength... Thank you for your time. - Have you finished? - Yes. Um... we met the other day, right? Yes. I was thinking the same, actually. How can they judge us so quickly? I'm not sure. I haven't passed any audition yet. What do I need to pass? I've never passed, either. - This way? - Yes. May I ask... what was your strength? - What? - In the audition. Didn't they ask you? They might have but what was my answer? I can't remember. Sorry, I'm going this way. Oh, see you then. Hope to see you in a studio. Expired long ago, my dear. - Too strong? - Yeah, a bit. Is it that strong? - For me. - I'm fine. I put some ginger in. That looks so weak. The color looks the same. Geez, go ahead. Coz I'm nice. You go. - You go. - After you. When did you start smoking? Huh? I can't remember. Did your ex smoke? I see. I'm jealous. Yeah, yeah. Don't leave your stubs. Don't leave any clues. Yes, Sir. A red bench I'm sitting on the bench Just sitting, doing nothing I'm getting hungry I feel great like any other days When I cleaned my glasses The world looked Ever so beautiful When a spring wind blows Will I be a little kinder I wonder? I want to change But I cannot change yet As for now, I'm wishing I could one day Thank you so much. - Just this, please. - Sure, welcome. One item, $1.40. Hey, Erika! Ai! You're back, too! What, a watermelon? Yep, it was cheap. Let's eat it later. I'm home. Welcome back. Welcome back. What're you playing? I'm working on the tune I dreamed? Yeah! Let's hear it. Well, it needs more work on both - tune and lyrics. - It's fine. Whoa! What's happening? What's going on? Oh my god! I'm scared! Hasn't anyone got a phone? Hold on, not now! Play it later. There must be my phone nearby. - Where? - Somewhere. - Wha, what's this? - Jesus! That's cute. What the heck is this? There we go. Find the breaker box! Hey, don't leave me alone! Just a sec, wait for me! - You go, Mizuho. - Where is it? - I'm afraid it's not here. - Oh come on! I need to make more effort! - Where's your tea? - Oh yeah. I'll top it up then. One oolong tea, please? - Thank you. - Who are you after today? Who did you come to see? Give me a sec. Who am I after? Yo! I'll take care of him. Can I have a beer? What's your name? - Pardon? - What's your name? - Mizuho. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh, eh? I'm Tamura. You look like a Tamura, that's huge! How come am I here even though I find clubbing so tiring? Cuz it's a form of self-harm? Huh? What's that? I'm being Mizuho. What's that reaction? Did you read my face? - Your hair color's mad. - You can talk! I'm in a good mood. Wow, Tete. She's totally in demand. Yeah, she is. What? - Firecrackers? - Interested? - We have them. - Why? We bought them. - 2 years ago? - Yep. That was ages ago. - Oh well. - Leave it! Wow! 36cm long pads?

From the real estate. - We've paid the rent, right? - Yeah. "Please empty the premise within 3 months due to demolition." Oh well, the time has come. Three. Two. One. Tell me who do I look like? - Who was it? - Oh come on. - It's almost there! - Say it! - Hiya. - Hello. Wait, here's a souvenir from my trip, take one. I'm fine, thank you. Go on, don't be shy. He took loads. - Well, I... - We all had it. I'm on a diet, right now. - I'm sorry. - But you're skinny. Not really. That's what models do, huh? What? Are you a model, Ai? Huh? Didn't you two know? She's off sometimes to take auditions. - Wow! - Oh my god! I'm not surprised! Well, I'm unknown, really. She knows Tete, too. - Really? - You know Tete? It's more like I've met her before. You told me you've worked with her. Yes, I used to. But not anymore. Meeting models can only happen in Tokyo. I'm not sure if I can call myself a model. Sounds amazing though! Where are you from, Moeko? From Kagoshima. But not from the city, the countryside. - How about you? - Yokohama. It's not Tokyo but pretty close. Oh yeah? Yokohama sounds nice. You think? I should do more than just living in Tokyo. Okay. I got it. All good for the shooting. Yes, see you later. - Long time no see. - Hi. Two beers, please? I told you I won't. Oh come on, it's been so long. Alright, just one. - Two beers. - Sure thing. Oh before I forget... Here. Your pictures that I took. That's all. Thanks. You caught me by surprise, what's up? I wanted to make a portfolio. I see, good for you. - Women are psychic. - What? My girlfriend's asking if I'm with someone. You've got girlfriend? Yeah, didn't I tell you? If was short after we broke up. Oh okay. - Here are your beers. - Thank you. Let's have a toast. Yeah. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, what's this about? Can you... take my picture again? Hmm... Let me think. Is that a no? Hmm...you know what? If I see you like this I find you charming even when you're stressed. But when you're on camera you try too hard, you know? I find that boring. What? Don't take it too serious. Hey. Do you do this often? I mean, one night stands. Nope. You're lying. You didn't hesitate at all. Huh? Were you serious? Dunno. I get it. No comment, huh? Doesn't bother me. Where do you live again? What? You going? We can stay. Hey. Connecting to voice mail... Connecting to... I'm home. Welcome back! Mizuho. I've kept your dinner. Sorry. You must be tired. Never mind. I'm dirty. You know... I'm a despicable person. I always go with the flow regardless, but later I get upset. What an idiot. Me and anyone who sleeps with me are shit. When you're in a bad mood the whole place tenses up. What? You bring all your problems back here. I'm off to bed. I saw you earlier in town. I don't know why but I worried about you. Why should you? I'm off to bed but I want you to stay up. What do you mean? I cut my finger today with the kitchen knife. Also... I was lonely eating dinner my myself. Good night. I'm home. Welcome back. I was with my friend, it's been a while. I see. Erika! - It's been ages! - It has! Since the graduation? - Yeah. - Oh wow. - You look well! - You, too! - I'm good! - Great! Ah! Are you still playing guitar? - Yeah. - Brings back memories. I wonder what's they're up to. What? You don't know? What? They'll play at Summer Festival! Isn't that amazing? - They're big now. - Oh wow. Oh yeah! Hey, why don't you call them? You might get an invitation. So you go to university? No, I didn't go. You didn't? Oh this is my stop. - Let's meet up. - Yep. See you then. Bye! May my wish come true Free tissues. Call us if you're interested. Earn big money in a short time! $450 for 3 hours! But your dinner's waiting at home. Sounds good. But sharing a room isn't for me. Cuz you've too many secrets. Secrets, huh? Everyone has secrets. But when I go home, somehow I get lonely. Despite living with people. I don't know why. The roommates spend a lot of time at home, whereas I'm rarely home. That makes me feel like I'm a stranger, like I'm a guest visiting my own home. But you often say "I wanna go home." Yeah. See? Which 'home,' I wonder? Hmm... - Huh? - What? This looks strange. Who cares? Hey. Yeah? Nothing, never mind. Spit it out. - The other day, - Yeah? I slept with someone else. You sleep with your girlfriend. I do. But I'm upset. Shall we get going? - No. - Yes. What the hell? I hate you. But I love you. That's why I'm angry. Let's get going. I hate you so much. I mean it, I hate you. But I love you. That's not enough. You hear? Not enough at all. I know. Ow! Ow! Ow! That hurts. What's up? You're hurting me more! You'll dump me one day. No, I won't. - If you'll dump me, do it now. - I won't. Then I want you to go home, see that bite mark, and desperately miss me! What's wrong? I don't get it. Come here. Come. Who's making me behave like this? Sorry. Sorry. Oof! - What's up? - Ai! Mizuho! Let's crack a watermelon! - One, two, - You're turning me too fast. - Three, four. - Enough! Okay? - Go ahead. - C'mon! Which way? Guys? Where are you? Go right, right! - There! - One, two... Oh my god, I'm scared! Seriously, I am! - One, two, three. - I don't like it! That's good! - Bit more right. - Bingo! - Here? - Yep! One, two... - Go! - Yeah! I hit it, didn't I? It's cracked, that was easy. Stop, stop! That's enough, I'm good! A bit more right. - That's good! - Am I there? One, two... Wow, it's good! That's pretty wild. Gigantic! Hey. Um, this is my friend Mizuho. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I live nearby, wanna come? It's okay, thank you. Okay, see you around. Bye now. I'm so sorry, I'll sort it out right away. - All good. - I'm doing the booking now. Revise the proposal, send it digitally! - I'm on it! - Hello. Mizuho! Why didn't you answer? - Huh? - The makeup for tomorrow, you booked the wrong one so the client's pulled out. I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Do your work properly. If you can't, we don't need you here. - Please... - Mizuho. Saya will take over your position for now. So you can go home. - Call the manager. - Right away! - He's pretty tough. - Got it! Camera rolling. All set! Ready, action! Cut! Hey, you! You, the green one. Me? Don't look at the camera, will you? No need. - I'm sorry. - Sorry, Tete! Okay then, second take. - Get ready. - I'm sorry. All set? Let's go. I'm glad to hear. You're getting better. Thanks. I know you love me, don't you? Are you kidding? Be honest, I don't mind. Actually, - since I first... - You! You know what? Miss 'wanna be' model. What? You 'wanna be' a model, and you'll stay a 'wanna be' forever. Understand? No, I don't. I'm risking my life here. If you can't be serious, quit already. When I cleaned my glasses The world looked Ever so beautiful When a spring wind blows Will I be a little kinder I wonder? I want to change But I cannot change yet As for now I'm wishing I could one day Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Excuse me. Do you sing here every day? Not every day, I won't come if it's raining. I see. Have you changed by doing this? I can't tell by myself. I suppose. Having said that, I thought this place's always the same. But I see different people each day. I've also noticed that the city keeps changing. I feel like I've been left behind from the world. I bet I'll stop having dreams. Dreams? Yes. Since I was young, I thought I never dreamed in my sleep. But since I started sharing a room with 2 girls, I begun to have dreams. That means I just couldn't remember my dreams before. Because I had no one to tell about my dreams when I woke up. Though my dreams make no sense. When I move out, I'll have no one to talk to. Dreams only exist if remembered. I guess...maybe? After you've moved, will you still be here? I guess so. Okay. I'll come again. Thank you. See you. Ai? What's wrong? I'm already dead. What? I've already said to myself 500 times "Pass this audition, or die." I can't even answer what my strength is. I had hundreds of chances to give up, but I couldn't. So I have no talent in 'giving up', neither in modeling. Modeling isn't my only choice, I can live just as a part-timer. But... I don't know... what to do with myself. It's okay. Ai. You're brave enough to face yourself. I wish I was like you, Erika. You know... I can't discipline myself like you. I'm home. Mizuho. A group hug? - Ai. - Yeah? You're very warm. I've got a mild fever. - Are you okay? - Yeah. We'd better start packing up soon. Yeah. Look! Shall we go on strike? I'm in! And me! Hey. Let's have fun and set off firecrackers? Oh yeah! Let's do it! Where are they? Ta-dah! Shall we? - Aren't they damp? - Nope. Let's light one. In here? Will it light? Nice one! - Can I do it? - Me, too! This is fantastic! - Stop it, you're making me cry. - How come? Why are you crying? Oh my god, so beautiful! All gone. I love you, guys. Me, too. Keisuke. Yeah? I can't see you anymore. I see. Can I convince you? No. Here. All dry. Thanks. No. I'm sorry. Wait... Chipped marbles Here you are thank you please come again. - These please. - Sure, welcome. What's with all these tapes? - Erika bought them. - Yep, I did. - Don't throw them away! - Okay. We've got far too much stuff, haven't we? Miss. Mizuho. - One question. - Be my guest. Aren't you in charge of the cleaning? Yeah, I am. The cooking for me, the laundry for Ai. And the cleaning. And you, Mizuho, you were in charge of making a mess. Excuse me? Phew! Writings everywhere. Listen guys, my song's finished. All right! What's it called? "Rolling Marbles." May my wish come true I kept going Never stopped dreaming I am a Superstar But something's not right I wonder why I see a sign from god While looking at each other This is a chance not to miss Let's start from scratch The marbles are chipped Yet they keep rolling Where are they going? Who knows? The marbles keep rolling Twinkling and rolling Maybe nobody is watching But they're still here What do you think? Absolutely fantastic. Really? - It was amazing. - Really? I'm glad.
