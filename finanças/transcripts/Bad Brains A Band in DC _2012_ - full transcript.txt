Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! No, I'm not the son of God. I'm not Lucifer, I'm not a demon, I'm not the devil. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You don't wanna do it? It's no good. I can't believe it. All these years. Finally get away from this shit. So, good luck with your life, man. Don't be calling my house and shit. talking about this and that and that and this, 'cause I see you coming to sabotage shit. You're a sell-out, I'm telling you that. Now, I hope I never have to see your ass again. We're at the famous secret studio of the Brains. My friends ask me if I be into exotic dancing or film-making, well, I'm a little shy about that. But I love all people. I think the time has come for black and white to truly unite. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, let's try it again. If I'm an expert at anything, it's lining up those songs. For many concerts, many years, I've done that. And in many records. I've just had an idea about... I know how that shit should drop, man. Should drop that shit like this... Right now, it's a little sporadic, you know. Well, we're getting ready to build a new empire, baby. We're gonna take those sweet, young children, teach them a better way. Starting right now. I'm standing in front of the White House. Where every president, since George Washington, has lived and worked. I played the bass originally in a band called Stress. We used to do funk covers basically. Earth, Wind and Fire. Parliament-Funkadelic. Me and Gary went to junior high school together and I introduced Gary to my brother. I remember meeting Gary at a concert. He asked me, could he play my guitar? I said, well, sure. Ad he starts playing all these cool jazz riffs and classical rhythm-and-blues lines. You know, H said, "Yo, man, I'm gonna play music with you. "I'll be in a band with you." He kinda wanted more of a challenge. So I said, let me pick up the guitar. H started playing the bass. We used to sit down and practice and practice. HR and I sit down there fingers be bleeding. But now, Darryl was younger than all of us. I was in this band called The Young Explorers. We used to play covers of like Earth, Wind and Fire and all that kind of stuff. We then assured Darryl that he wasn't breaking the law. It wasn't illegal to be a musician. And Darryl started playing bass. HR started to sing. Tried to play like what we were listening to, you know. Return to Forever, all this jazz fusion stuff. Chick Corea. Stanley Clarke. George Duke and all those cats. I actually wrote Stanley Clarke letters and shit. Like fan-club shit. My biggest influence was Lenny White. I'd seen him live before and he just tripped me out, man. Looked like it was a motion picture in action. I saw a PBS special and they were highlighting the New Wave out of London. I think the first band I saw was the Sex Pistols and The Damned. That was the shit. That was the new thing for me. I went and bought all their albums. And I took 'em to Darryl with the same enthusiasm, "Man, you got to hear this stuff, man. "You know, It's gonna drive you crazy, man, "but you're gonna love it." Sid hipped us to this band called the Dead Boys. We heard the Dead Boys, I was like, yeah, that's what we wanna try and start doing, you know. We were called Mind Power. And then I found this Ramones song. Bad Brains was like Mind Power, it was the same thing. But Bad Brains reminded me of like your brain being up in the refrigerator, like rotting and some shit. So, to switch over from punk Mind Power to Bad Brain, and go to... That's what I thought was cool. It was the summer of 1979, word was that there was and all-black, punk-rock band in Washington, D.C. Never seen one of those before and they're local, we gotta check that out. We were walking down to the Bayou to see the band. And here comes this opening band, the Bad Brains. We all went up to the front and had our minds completely blown. We walked out of there going, "Damned, great. "But the Bad Brains..." D.C. had a "punk-rock scene." That was a very, very small group of people. But they congregated around this one club in Adams Morgan, section of D.C., called Madam's Organ. At Madam's Organ, I remember standing in front of Bad Brains one night with HR so close, I could smell his breath. And I said, "I sure hope that guy doesn't land on me." Wham, I'm on my back, with HR pinning me to the ground singing on me. I was like... "Whoa!" And that was kind of, uh, the, uh, kind of, the start of my life. Oh, we going by R Street, hold up. This where I used to live when the Bad Brains started. Right there, that's where the Bad Brains started. - This is R Street. - What day was it? R Street. Where punk rock started. We was gonna play faster and more technical than the Ramones and be more chaotic than The Damned. You go up Addison Road, you see the notorious Al Tolson... And this where the rehearsals started. This is where the music started formulating. The glue that hooked us all up was our friend, Alvarez. We could go over there on Tuesdays and Thursdays, in the evening, for three or four hours, and jam. Because his mother would go and play bingo. We used to own some Fred Sanford up in this motherfucker. I'm sorry to see the spot like this, man. I know, man, gosh. Look. What the fuck? The fire department ripped the whole house. Looks like the whole place has been torn apart. Ripped. Two-alarm fire... Came and kicked everything. Look, I have nothing. My clothes, everything is gone. We all used to jam down in this basement right here. Yeah, this is where we used to do it at, right here. This was the beginning. Darryl used to play his drums right here. Bass, drums. Right in here. You wanna see your tape recorder? Yeah. This the tape recorder when we used to record all the Bad Brains music on. - That's it? - Mmm-hmm. - Yeah, that's pretty. - I've never seen that. With all that, like, all that shit written on it. Yeah, so I've had that for years. That's what I'm saying, that was over ten years, probably. You wouldn't mind signing that, would you? Not at all. What's up, kid? Come in here and tell them how we used to do back in the day. Do you like the store? You like the way the store looks? This store is beautiful. Did you meet everybody? I met all these nice guys. We were talking about punk-rock days. This band is insane. This band is insane. No, the band's not insane. The lead singer is insane. ♪ Not as much but with such intensity ♪ I'd like to be what they would not want me to be ♪ I like to cram their chivalry inside of their guts ♪ I'd like to leave it all behind ♪ With the rest of the nuts ♪ One of the most incredible things about Bad Brains, which I'd never seen before, was the fact that, from the first measure, of the first song, HR's in the audience. HR is singing to people. HR is pulling people on stage. The audience became as much a part of the show as the band. As far as what a frontman should do, and how a frontman should be, physically, as far as blowing your mind and making you wanna buy the T-shirt. Or, like, if that guy led a charge, you'd go invade Gaul. HR and Iggy Pop, to me, are the two most charismatic, "I-wanna-be-that-dude" frontmen I've ever seen. Yeah, I was a very shy child. It took everything in their power to get me to come on, on that stage. But then, once I did, I'd do my best to vocalize. I can remember being just a little bit jealous because everybody was like, "Oh, my God, you have to see this frontman." "He's the greatest thing you've ever seen," you know. "He's the wildest guy in the world." "He does backflips off the stage." I got into a conversation with my dad one day and he said, "You know what, I think I'm gonna share something with you. "Why don't you go read a book," and he gives me this book, and I see it and it says, Think and Grow Rich. And it made sense, you know, to stay positive, not to worry. It would show how people who refrain from living violently would get a good response. Bad Brains were running this PMA thing, and their whole thing was that music should mean something, but it should also have a message to the audience, which pushes the audience as part of the thing. And that had an enormous effect on us. Have a positive mental attitude, go out there and do what you have to do and make it work. And if you do it, it will work. The punk music in England was informative but it was more like, you know, fuck this, fuck that. We wanted to try to give an alternative and unify the people and, yes, we can make a change if we're unified, as opposed to just saying, you know, "This is screwed up and that's screwed up. "And that's just the way it is." I think that was the difference, initially, in our message, and you know, just being positive, as opposed to destructing. Everywhere else, punk rock was like connected to nihilism, like, set to destruction. And actually, we heard PMA sort of saying like, like, "We're making something, we're building something." We just gonna burn out our batteries doing this shit. Getting all ready. Cameras. Okay, that's enough there, man. Come on, man. What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? Yes. Buffy Sainte-Marie. Buffy Sainte-Marie. Countey, he's like a hippy almost. He still has a sweet, hippy type of approach to this. Hi there, everybody. This is HR, Human Rights for Brains. We're here now in the beautiful city of Portland. Been waiting to see them since I was this big. Wow. My first hardcore album. ♪ So I'm sailing, oh, I'm sailing on ♪ I'm moving, I'm moving on ♪ Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on ♪ Sailing on ♪ I'm moving on ♪ I'm moving on ♪ Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on ♪ ♪ Redbone in the city ♪ By August 1979, the band had recorded the demo session that became the Black Dots album. For us, it was just this cassette. That cassette was our first recording. In the guy's house. One of the bedrooms was where all the equipment was. I think Earl did the drums in the basement. Put my amplifier in the bathroom and Darryl's amplifier in the other bedroom. Then you heard me say, "Can you hold it for a second?" "Can you hold it for a second?" 'Cause I was doing an overdub in the basement. So, I had to yell upstairs, "Hold up, I'm not ready, I've gotta tune." ♪ Redbone in the city ♪ Redbone in the city ♪ HR did the vocals outside. He had some kind of shrubbery or something. That's why you're hearing the crickets, 'cause he was singing by the shrubbery. ♪ Redbone in the city ♪ The record was never a record in those days, it was just a cassette. Had the Bad Brains pressed up a thousand LP of that tape, that single album would have been a determinant record in what's known as American hardcore music and American independent music. And it wouldn't have taken until the new century for a documentary on that band to come out. Now, you started out in D.C. And you were there for several years before you made the move to New York. And what made you move? D.C.'s for politicians and restaurant owners. Really. Um... We played enough there, you know. We played a lot in Washington. We had a hard time playing down there. We mostly played like basement parties and stuff like that. They actually banned us. Yeah. There was only three clubs at the time and each club owner knew each other and we played in one club and it's like, "Oh, you guys entice riots and you make people jump up..." And those days, it was pogoing, instead of slamming, creepy crawling, whatever. One calls the next one and it's like, "Sorry guys, you can't play anymore." So, we said, "All right, we'll go to New York." I remember seeing the Bad Brains not having a clue what they were doing. I mean, there was jumping around. So, we're watching it, we were digging it. But we just had never seen anything like it. They were light-years ahead of anybody playing on the local scene. They were skilled, they were original, they were monster musicians. Anybody who would see them would obviously say, "Well, this band is better than any other band "we've ever seen." In those early shows, you know, it'd be like a club the size of this room with like ten people in the audience. Not even. Not even the size of this room. It was like a couple of shows you started to realize how incredible they were. We had to go play the great CBGB's. I remember getting off the Holland Tunnel and coming up Canal Street and turning on the Bowery and, oh, there it is. We kept coming back and playing CB's. So, we'd come once a month. He said, "Okay, I'm gonna give you guys Friday night." So, Friday night at CB's. It don't get no bigger than that. They went over to England to play with The Damned. The Damned said, "Come on over, we'll take you on tour." They got their offer within months of their first couple shows in New York. You know, so, things were happening quick. So, we sold all our equipment, except for our guitars, and got the money to get the tickets to go to London. Little did we know there was a small, minor detail called working papers. Captain says we'll stand there with a couple thousand, you know, pounds and saying, "They don't have any money? Fine. "Here's money. They're coming on tour with us. "Here's the money. They have money. "They can come into the country. "As soon as you let them in the country, "they have money, that's not an issue. "They're not vagrants they can come in here." They got all these spray-painted suits and they're trying to pass themselves off as tourists. The local constabulary at the time didn't like the way they looked. We were all sitting in some room in the airport waiting for the next flight out. They took our passports. We caught the flight to England, caught the next flight back. Come to find out, our guitars had gotten stolen in JFK. They never even got on the plane. So, we had literally nothing. We got back to New York, we actually had to panhandle to get the money to catch a train to get back. Back in New York, they had no money, lived on corn chips and beer, and played on borrowed equipment. No fun. But bass player, Darryl, just became more determined than ever. It got hard. It got hard for me. You know, I didn't... You know, after all that. But I had to still be strong and say, "Well, this is what I'm all about. "'Cause this is what I wanna do. "And that's what I'm gonna do, no matter what." We all lived off five dollars a day for, I don't know, six months, and we had to use the old brain there, 'cause we were hanging out in Washington Square Park and that was the days when they used to sell loose joints for a buck. We just like, "Hmm... "We'd better get us five dollars here and go buy us a bag "and let's roll up some joints." Then we would take that, turn that into $15. Because we lived on the East Side, we started selling the joints in Tompkins Square Park. Had to get $15 out of that $5, since we had to go buy the next bag and then we had to have $5 to buy food. It was cool going up to New York and struggling, you know. It became quite an adventure. It wasn't easy at all. But we set forth to do that and that's what we did, you know. And then we actually went back to Washington and lived for a while. I was a restaurant owner that had a lot of celebrity patrons. I had a waiter named Pierre, who was a communist, self-confessed communist, that said that he was doing a film with he and his buddies, would I be interested in helping finance it? And I watched it, it was this awful film. I was, you know, getting a headache, but they had filmed the Bad Brains at Max's Kansas City. ♪ Don't need no ivory liquid ♪ Don't want no afro sheen ♪ Don't need the latest fashions ♪ Don't want my hair to smell bad ♪ I've got my automotion ♪ I've got that superpotion ♪ And if you think I'm going crazy ♪ Then pretty baby it might be true babe ♪ The hair on the back of my neck sort of went... 'Cause they were so electrifying. He invited us to dinner, you know. We had no money in those times. It was like, wow, here we are, punk rocked out in this five-star restaurant. And he said, "Hey, I'd like to help you guys out." HR called me Mr. Sussman. Polite, very short hair, no dreads. I was a, you know, Frank Sinatra kinda guy, but I dug what they were doing. I didn't know anything about being the manager of a band. They had basically nothing, no van. They had no equipment. So, a friend of mine owned a music store. He took us up to Chuck Levin's. All the salesmen came out, you know. The guitar guy, the drum guy. But HR, they wanted to get him a mike. He was a little disappointed at the time. He didn't get shit, yeah. So, he went back, way back in the back, of Chuck Levin's and got this red, hollow-body, B.B. King-looking guitar. I got them all new equipment. Got them a brand new van. I obligated myself to $25,000 which I spent relatively quickly. Maybe the second or third time we played CB's, my equipment got stolen. 'Cause we're a bunch of idiots and left the equipment in the van, sitting on 12th Street. One night when it was really cold, Bad Brains played a show and flopped at Nick's house, like they always did. And I felt sorry for the roadie guy who was trying to sleep in the van, 'cause it was probably like, 10 degrees out. And I said, "Oh, okay, come on and sleep "at Nick's house, it's all right." Four, five hours later when the sun's up everybody looks out Nick's window and there's this big empty parking space where the van used to be. Brand new van, brand new equipment, sitting on 12th Street at Avenue B. I had insurance, so I got them another van, and I got them new equipment. God bless you. We find your peace life improvable. God bless you for coming to the show tonight. God bless your days. Coming in and your going out. God bless your mama and your papa, your uncles and your aunts. God bless your granny and your grandpas. God bless your mother and your father and your brothers and sisters. God bless your soul. And God bless your children's soul. And God bless I and I soul. ♪ The youth are getting restless ♪ The youth are getting restless ♪ The youth are getting restless ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ A 16-year-old girl don't drop out of school ♪ I said She's tired of being a fool ♪ A 19-year-old man...

See, I remember when I used to drive y'all around in my station wagon. The green station wagon? The green station wagon. Yeah. To go play, somebody to go practice, load everything up, get in the car here I go, and I'm still driving people around. How are you, sweetie? I'm doing okay. Are you? How are you?

I see. ♪ The youth are getting restless ♪ The youth are getting restless ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ 1980 is when we saw Bob Marley. We had known of Bob a little but we didn't really know. I remember walking into the arena and just hearing the bass, that's like a 10,000-seat place, you know. It's amazing, and that was it. In the whole influence of Rasta and Africanism and who we were as men, started to want to take over as opposed to, being like lost youths from D.C., kinda on some rock and roll shit. And once we came across Marley and Rasta and the whole vibe and the message that went with that, that's when things started to change seriously for us. But not so much our music, but the message of our music went from a PMA to a Rasta, which was the same thing. Rastas used to be like how they see like the Taliban and Muslims are nowadays, terrorists. Like, I think that The New York Times even had an article out back in the early '80s about these new terrorists, and this Rasta and how lethal the foot like to kicking soccer and lethal will kick your ass with a lethal foot up the ass or something, you know. So, it was in the years before you started seeing dreadlocks in a Gap add or some shit like that. It used to be a real underground thing. A friend of mine who was in the restaurant business owned this really groovy house in the backwoods of Virginia. So, I got the Bad Brains to live there. So we would just sit out there and just play music all the time. Twenty-four hours a day. And it sits back of the woods, no other houses around... It's perfect, you know. We could just play, we literally played music all the time, loud, and never had any complaints, 'cause there were no neighbors. We are all the same. You are all together. It was a great experience for me. If it wasn't for that house on Dranesville Road, I don't think I'd be sitting here in America today playing music, 'cause I learned a lot about drum, bass and guitar, and some keyboards from the original Dr. Know himself. We had classes, we had a blackboard and we would go through stuff, you know what I mean? Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do scales and augmented and diminished and sharps and flats, and all that type of stuff we did. And we cooked a lot of beans and rice. And smoked a lot of weed and played from 6:00 in the evening till 6:00 in the morning. And there was a haze of marijuana in the house at all times. The farmhouse was perfect. They could grow their marijuana, they could smoke their marijuana, they could play, they wouldn't bother anybody. The neighbors weren't appreciative of having four black punkers living on their land. And I never put that together until it was too late. The old local cops there got wind of a bunch of black brothers back here back in the woods over here. We were coming home from the music store, pull up in the driveway, all excited, taking out the gear, you know, going in the house, setting it up... All of a sudden, Babylon just come in on us, you know. Kicked the door in, "On the floor!" Just so happened that particular day, we had the new equipment, so they think that we got some kind of fencing thing going, we all stole the equipment, and it's like, "Where's the guns?" you know. Rasta gotta have guns and pounds and pounds of weed. They ain't finding no guns, they ain't finding all these pounds of weed, and all that. None of that bullshit, you know? When it became obvious that it really was a black-white thing, that they wanted to get rid of 'em. Then it all went away, nobody got charged, nobody went to jail. ♪ I luv, I luv I Jah ♪ And I luv, I luv I Jah ♪ That magic summer, they went away and they reappeared... I remember they came out and they were all wearing like button-up shirts, and they had nice pants on and they had new equipment, Gary had a wood grain kind of natural guitar. And we're like, "What's going on?" In come the Bad Brains, and all these new people with them. Here's Julian, very scary Rasta guy. Here's these Rasta women with them. Ian and myself and the rest of the normal gang addressed them as we always did, "Hey, HR." "Yes, Henry man." "Excuse me?" "All is irie." Irie? "Who are you?" ♪ They try to make I feel ashamed ♪ But I ♪ Luv, I Jah ♪ Just like Henry and Ian can look at you and say, "All of a sudden they came back and it was Jamaican," someone in their family can say, all of a sudden they came home from high school and they was Sid Vicious. Before, when he left, he was Jimmy Page. So yeah, it kept changing for me, from when I was a teenager. Ah, Darryl, he's a white boy, lookit, he wear leather pants and you know... How do you think a dude in Southeast feels when he see me and I'm walking down the street in some leather pants, and ripped-up shirt? "That nigga's a white boy." Right? So now, when I go, and the white boy sees me, and he say, "Oh, these black dudes is cool. "They're the Bad Brains." Then the Bad Brains go off and see Bob Marley, then they came back, "Yes I-ah." "Oh, man, shit, wonder what happened to them dudes, man, "they used to be punks and now they're like Rastas." There's a line of spirituality running through your music and your lyrics. How important is Rastafarianism to you? It's our life, so it is of the utmost importance. It turned a lot of people off but I think it also gave some people... It empowered other people. HR started getting me to grow dreads and shit. We had the UFF. The United Freedom Fighters, and it was this organization that HR started and like, we had meetings and we were gonna change the world and the planet and all that shit. And after like three or four spliffs, everybody was like, "What were we talking about now?" Everyone started talking like Rastas all of a sudden. When we were stoned and sittin' on a stoop, going, "Yes boss, scooch, yeah, yeah man, "my shit up, yeah..." But to me, I loved it When they played dub, like it actually balanced out the whole show, 'cause to just go and listen to most hardcore bands, after about like seven songs, you're kinda like... Burnt. Well, yeah, like, you're kinda like your ears get burned out. But the way that they were able to play like three hardcore songs and then like settle into like a dub track kinda like soothed the audience just long enough, until they'd hit them again with more hardcore... That's one of the main things that separated the Bad Brains and made them all that much more kind of awe-inspiring, was that, they actually had a genuine pacing to their show because they had this whole reggae and dub element. When they pressed up their first single, it was pressed in New York and they needed a car to go pick up the eight boxes of the 7-inch, and I went, "Here's my keys." For 99 cents, I got this flimsy little, you know, Xeroxed thing, and I put this thing on. I thought, it must be a 33 rpm single, and I've gone and got it on 45, there's something wrong. Stopped it, put it on 33... And then I was like, "Okay, this sounds a little more right," but then the vocal came and it was totally wrong. And I probably played it conservatively 16 to 20 times that afternoon. I just couldn't believe it. It was... It flew in the face of everything I ever learned about being a rock musician, and in a good way. Thing about the Brains that's so phenomenal, is that we were recorded in 1983 as being the fastest band on the planet Earth. And shortly after that we got on the Guinness Book of World Records. It was unlike anything I'd ever heard before. And it was faster, it was more raw, it was more powerful than anything I'd ever listened to before. Those guys were such amazing musicians, Mo Sussman wanted them to sell out and play pop music. That's why when the first single came out, it was Pay to Cum! and Stay Close to Me on the other side. ♪ Stay close to me ♪ Mo Sussman wanted to push them as a pop group. That's how talented they were. For people to think, this is all they could've done, that's not the truth. They could have sold out and played pop music and sold millions of records. Their heart was in punk, and that's why they chose the punk route. Because if you look at that single, it's like there's two paths they could have taken. If they had taken it one more step, they could have been much more important than they are now. Unless, of course, they're important because they did the opposite. Maybe if they sold out, which everyone was accusing me of trying to do with the Bad Brains, maybe they wouldn't have become important. Banned in D.C. had nothing to do with me. Banned in D.C. had to do with the fact that club owners wouldn't let them play because of HR's 50-to 100-person guest list. We relocated to New York and began promoting our own events. And we were just gutted. We couldn't believe they were gonna move to New York. Because they were such a Washington band, I was like, that was our world. If we would've stayed here, what would have happened? Signed to Dischord and sold a million records? You never know. Everyone knew there was something going on, but nobody knew what to do. And I had tried to do something with what was going on, but I was not successful. To me they embody like the best parts of music, like... A philosophy, you know, ideals, roots music, you know, and place to put your aggression. Hardcore was kind of rising up out of the ashes of the old punk movement, that was sort of fizzling out. The Bad Brains coming up from D.C. was just a focal point for all these kind of like-minded misfits. They talked the talk and they walked the walk. They're were the most benevolent scene leaders I've ever seen. Their entire thing was again to be one with the audience, and then they even immediately became one with all the bands they played with. We used to borrow their equipment all the time. Twice they handed us their instruments, when their own gig was finished. I never heard of this before or since. They would do a gig. At the very end, HR and Dr. Know would say like, "Hey, you guys, Even Worse, "come up, come up!" "What, what?" "You guys play now." They were one of the biggest musical influences on me. Period. Growing up around them, I had a very special connection to them, especially because I was like, nine, ten years old. I learned how to play a bass from watching Darryl. You know, I... Obviously, I developed my own style but he was one of the key ingredients. We played one of our first shows, I think it was about, like, our third show and HR is all of a sudden like in the middle of the crowd, and HR starts slamming into all the kids and like moving and all of a sudden like the room lit up and the whole energy in the room like he definitely set it off. It was just like, "Wow, like HR's in the audience at our show!" It was crazy, and he said, "You know we got this gig coming up, "at Max's in a couple of weeks "if you guys wanna open up for us." I first saw the Bad Brains in 1981. I got a vibe coming off the stage that I'd only felt when I'd seen Jimi Hendrix or the Rolling Stones. The band and the audience got into a highly refined state of mind, almost like a religious experience. I'd set up a rehearsal space, address was 171 Avenue A between 10th and 11th Street, an old glass shop. 171 consisted of one long room. We set up the stage on one end and back near the entrance, we had an elevated sound booth, so that we could do recordings. We used to charge $10 an hour for recording, you know. Just the most economical recording you could find in town at that time. It was like more, like off, off, off, off, off Broadway-type theater. You know, something like maybe a world that Adam was more, uh, familiar with, as a thespian. You mean the Yiddish theater? Yeah, exactly. The funny thing about 171-A, too, was it was a bunch of couches that they had dragged in off the street. So there was like 10 like real dirty, nasty couches around there. And I'm sure it was illegal, I'm sure they didn't have any kind of license to do it, like it was Avenue A and back then, like, you know... Avenue A was kind of off the map, you know. Well, yeah, I mean, look, most of what happened on Avenue A at that time was illegal. The Bad Brains played the night of May 2nd, 1981, and I recorded it. We kind of fell in love with each other, you know, they appreciated the sound I got. At that time no major label would touch that kind of music and by the beginning of '82 ROIR had issued the tape. Since they came from the capital, they chose a cover design that featured the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. I played like my first cassette, I probably just wore that thing out that meant so much to me. Yeah, that ROIR cassette, I remember I had a Walkman, like the early... Like the first Walkman, and I would just sit in school just like sit in the hallway on the floor and just like listen to that like over and over and over again. You know, I think that that record just captures the way that they sounded live. The amplifiers were all distorting, and the PA was distorting. Everything was kinda like combining together in a certain way. And I think that, that really got captured in the four-track. Ladies and gentlemen, here we are. This is the mighty defender of the truth and he's up against, you know who? The one and only Doom. What are you gonna do that for, how dare you? - I'm just a Doom. - I'll get you. No, you won't. As you know, you've got to feed the people, for along with good music, and good wine and good beer and good water and good Pepsi, one must have food. So, we're going to feed the masses, make sure that their stomachs have something in it because when we start shredding... There's no holding us back. On Monday, March 1st, 1982, the Bad Brains, with their associated roadies, loaded into a van that we had rented from the band called Joey Miserable and The Worms and set off for California and a number of gigs on the West Coast. We used to call it the Slave Ship, and we were just all in there with the equipment. It was four, five, six, seven of us. We had to travel straight across the country to our first gig in San Francisco. Every place we played, we had a huge response. We drove across New Mexico into Texas to Austin and ended up staying at the house of The Big Boys, I believe. The singer in Big Boys thought HR was absolutely wonderful. And HR at that point was beginning to... You know, I mean, he read the Bible a lot. The Big Boys had showed great kindness to the Bad Brains, putting them up in their house. One of the Big Boys had procured a bag of herb, saying, you know, "After you receive your pay for the gig, "you can pay us back." And in fact I stood beside Doc as he put the money in an envelope, and left it on our host dresser in his room. I found out later that somebody had gone into the room and had taken that envelope of money and replaced it with a note saying, uh, something to the effect of "Fire burn all faggots," you know. And, you can draw your own conclusions as who could've done that. We got the bad rap on that and that was a racial rap. This story's been told that we came through like some renegade Rastas like, on some homophobic shit. If it's Led Zeppelin, "Man, these fucking guys are assholes, they rot." When Bad Brains comes in your house, burns the carpet with spliff tails or whatever, spills Ital stew and HR calls you a batty boy and takes your weed, then there's like a whole big... It's deeper somehow... That's what I say. I say it's complicated. I'm not gonna say... Homophobia, that's just homophobia. Yeah, but... I'm just... That's the way I look at it. But people still bitch at us about the homophobia. I'm just saying, that's just... Still today. Right. I know, I know, but... Like you said it's like a scab, it's real. That shit stuck with my shit, it turned... It turned all the beautiful things that you hear them saying about us being how HR will literally put his fucking coat down for you to walk over a puddle, he was that kind of guy. It was at a point in time where a band... Like, it was like when the Misfits, when they went to San Francisco, they beat somebody up at the show, they were like vilified for it. It was in the era where anybody, if you misstepped, you just got hell. And the Bad Brains thing, it just, unfortunately, not only did something bad go down, that was this youthful indiscretion, - let's say it's that. - Yeah. But nonetheless, the problem is you had the amplifiers, you had people who just picked up on it and ran with it. Any cat in rock that goes, "Fuck those faggots" or something like that, they're not gonna get what the fuck we got for going, "Batty boy," they're not getting that, they just getting, "You guys..." For some reason with us is like a living legacy, I had to go on the Internet and tell them, "Look, I love all people, "we have learned to love all people, "we were young too, we grew." You know, no one's out to get anybody, you know, but then, granted, HR did get off into some weird shit after a while, you know. HR is in Baltimore still. He's still in Baltimore. Waiting for a flight, he's got a flight at 8:30, I booked it last night at 2:00 in the morning. HR talked about taking a car. So he's gonna hire a limo. Kind of a distance. Three days in a limo. Come on. US Air, yeah. That's what I'm saying. US Air. What he's saying now? He went to the wrong airline. They were saying, "No that flight left early today." Hey, HR, how are you? It's Anthony. So, I'm in Buffalo and Darryl's here and Doc is here and Earl is here, and everybody else is on their way. So I'm just checking in with you. Call me back when you get this and... Just want to make sure everything's fine for the flight that you're getting on, which is in about an hour and a half, so you're probably on your way to the airport. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye. I'm not sure. He left early this morning for where? So he's... Apparently he got up this morning and left. Grant has no idea how he left. But he left. Probably in a car. So he's probably just doing that. I mean, I don't know... It's like, I'm gonna have to eat the flights. That sucks. Greetings, brothers and sisters. We're here live in Toronto, Canada, with the Brains. And showtime will be momentarily. And thank you very much for your cooperation and your patience. I'm HR, aka EHD. Love I. Rastafari. Ric Ocasek said he had our ROIR cassette on his tour bus. It would fire him up to go on stage. So he got a hold of us when we played in Boston. I thought it was really cool. I thought it was strange too, because I didn't really like his band that much. And I was a punker kid like I hated The Cars. You know, it was cool to hate The Cars if you were into punk. You know, at that time I was kind of like a... I was always looking for things like that. A lot of bands that came through Boston I would try to get them to come to the studio and, you know, do tracks. You know, like Suicide, and Romeo Void, whatever was far away from kind of like what I was doing. He was a really nice guy to us and really brought us to his studio, recorded our album and he was sort of like the rock star coming to bring us into the rock star world, you know, give us good guitars and shit and takes us to places, give us a per diem and all that. Ric was just a sweetheart, you know, very supportive and he gave me a guitar. That was our first time going into a real proper studio. And we went in there for three days, and recorded the whole album in three days. You don't have to dis my man Ric Ocasek because The Cars are great in their own right, but I remember feeling a little disappointed when they like had Ric Ocasek producing a Bad Brains record and I was thinking like, "Why are they having Ric Ocasek produce a Bad Brains record? "Like, they just made "the most incredible sounding thing "at 171-A, "like why would they want to go into this like fancy studio "and make this other thing?" There weren't too many kids in the hardcore scene that... Then, that weren't influenced by Rock for Light. You had to have that record. You had to know that record. If you didn't know that record your other punk rock friends might be a little suspicious. You know, like... I know every drum lick off of that record and I have since I was 14. I knew every single one of their songs front to back. And from listening to Earl. Earl didn't flail around like a lot of the spazzy, fucking white punk rock drummers like me. Earl was like Bernard Purdie or something, you know. He just had this thing, right. He just seemed like it was nothing. Like whatever. He was just killing it. Who gives a shit? I still use a lot of the tricks that I learned from Earl, still to this day. I listen to Nevermind and there's little fills here and there that I took from Earl. Listen to How Low Can A Punk Get from that Rat Music for Rat People compilation. And listen to the intro of Smells Like Teen Spirit. They're not exactly the same but it's close. And that's where I learned how to do it. So they're a huge influence on the whole band. London, England. This is one of the most famous clubs in the world where we'll be performing tonight. I mean, we're talking about a place where brothers and sisters came to see... James Brown, Deep Funk, and Madonna. A'ight, a'ight, a'ight. Respect. Good to see you all. What's going on, Don? Bad Brains tonight. That's about it for me. That's enough from me. Bad Brains, man. There's no one else that you can really hold up and say, "Yes, "this is an example of the punk thing "having an effect on some brothers." You know, people that weren't prepared to be defined by their color. Bad Brains are the Sex Pistols of America. I mean what the Pistols did for the UK scene, Bad Brains undoubtedly did for the American scene. Ask the Chili Peppers. Ask the Beastie Boys. Ask Black Flag. Ask Fugazi, man, and countless others. It's undeniable. I mean, a really incredible band. And really individual. The best is yet to come. I haven't had anything to smoke since yesterday. I guess I better get another key. I have no idea how to get ahold of the bus driver. You know how to get back to the hotel? Do you have anything written down? So the bus driver's not at the bus. I don't have the bus driver's number. I guess it's probably in my itinerary. I know, but he also locked... There's also a physical lock. Key lock that he actually set. 'Cause the door won't open. Hi, boys and girls. Hi, everybody. Oh, thank you so much for your patience and cooperation. We'll have the show starting as soon as possible here now in the Netherlands. This guy's a joke, all right? This guy's a joke, okay? I'm telling you now. I'm not you. You can't come to me doing that shit. Fuck that, man. They throwing shit on the stage. They suck. We got hooked up with this cat Ron Saint Germain, supposed to be, like, work with Hendrix. Very technical dude in the studio. He really just wanted to capture the band as the band. Ron had the idea of going to Long View. It's a great magical situation to come away from the city and go to Springfield, Massachusetts, in the middle of real cow country. Doc and Darryl, and Earl, for that matter, were so inspired, they were always shooting what I call shooting from the hip, you know. Not unlike Hendrix who also played from the heart and from the hip. So we'd do five or six takes. I couldn't run HR through that. Because vocally, it's such a demanding album that there would have been no voice whatsoever. And he tells me Sunday afternoon, he says, "Well, Ron, I kinda gotta go "in a couple of hours," and I said, "What do you mean?" He says, "Yeah, I gotta go to D.C." I said, "What for?" And he says, "Well, "I gotta go to jail." Right before we went to record this, HR got busted in D.C. with a bunch of pot. He ended up getting some time, like six months or something like that. So we were kind of pinched. We had enough time, we had two hours so... I basically just said, "Run down, "give me two takes on each song." I finished the recording with HR and then he had to go serve three or four months. And I had the one song which wasn't finished, Sacred Love. They just didn't have the vocal on that particular song. And Ron was just like, I saw he was like brainstorming. It's like, "What we gonna do? How we gonna do this?" You know, he was like, "Well, you know Johnny Cash did a record in jail." Took almost two months to arrange for HR to get to a payphone in the D.C. jail. He'd gotten to be one of the guys who gets to sweep up and he got to be near the payphone when nobody else was around. Ron had him unscrew the mouthpiece and hold it up like a microphone and hold the headset part so he wouldn't get feedback. Early on in the session I can hear he's kind of messing around with something. And I said, "HR, what are you doing, man?" He says, "I'm getting high." The story is, he used to always carry his Bible with him. He used to always open his Bible and then he'd clean his herb on the title page. So over the years this title page is black with resin. He ripped that page out, rolled it up and sparked it. So he's smoking the Bible. ♪ Sacred love ♪ Sacred love ♪ Sacred love ♪ Sacred love ♪ And he did a couple, two, three takes and that was it. It was tremendous. All the guys down one of the tiers could hear him singing, so it was pretty amazing he was able to get away with it. ♪ I'm in here, you're out there ♪ We know what's right ♪ No crying, no lying ♪ Our hearts declared ♪ We're basically on the west side of New York. First punk show I've ever seen on a boat. Seeing one of the legends of American hardcore, the Bad Brains. Really looking forward to it. These guys are our guys, man. I didn't ever listen to punk rock music until I went to my dad's show. And I was like, "Oh, my God, this is amazing." And then I got really into it. And I was like, this is the best band ever. It's like a whole experience, like, going there. I explain it to some of my friends, like, "Dude, you see the Bad Brains perform, "and you're just like blown away." It's so special, I get look and hear all the people like, "Amazing," around me and I just have that little gem inside like, "That's my dad." Proud feeling. It's good. Now, I did talk with, um, his friend. The other president. What's his name? Charlton Heston. Remember Charlton Heston? You know, the one who did the movie Ben Hur, you know, the Bible, and those other movies. Anyway, his daughter assured me that Paris and the others, remember Paris Hilton, they're gonna keep up the good work, okay? So I'll see you later, all right. All right, God bless you. Thank you for coming to the show. Rastafari. What just happened? I honestly hope that HR consistently finds inner peace, you know. You know, he's touched with that thing, he's touched with that extraordinary... "Genius" is an overused word, but he is really one of a kind. I mean, he is of a kind like Thelonious Monk, even though people will holler and scream but something so implacably original that he is that thing. HR wanted to start a new band called the Zion Train. This was a band that was gonna do pure reggae. And have a dancing chorus of girls. Horn section. It might have worked. There was the whole Zion Train phase. We'd go see the shows, and appreciate what they're doing but was not what we particularly wanted to see. We went to CB's when they came out, we were all psyched to see them and they just played a whole set of reggae. It was just like... What did I smoke this joint for? Nothing. When HR came to say we was going to be called Zion Train, I wasn't really feeling that. And I was thinking 'cause I loved my Bad Brains in the unit that we had and I wasn't really into it. We're all brothers, you know. We all grew up and went to junior high school and high school together and all that, you know. It's a family, so you know you get tired of your brothers. So you gotta take a little break. You know? The band broke up soon after that. Human Rights are HR's band. He did that immediately when he left. And the band got back together in '85, '86 and broke up again sometime in '87. HR needed a drummer. If Bad Brains wasn't going to happen, Earl was gonna go with HR and play drums there. I was a fan of the band so... And I wanted to be in the band, to be in my favorite band, but to be in the band with someone other than HR didn't seem right, but kids were... They were into it, anyway. The Brains is not one person. The Brains is the works of a father. "Darryl," I said, "Let's try out some "other singers, 'cause we gotta do what we gotta do, you know." Chuck Mosley from Faith No More sang for maybe a year or something, you know. We did some short tours. We ended up getting this guy, Taj and they ended up calling it the Bad Brains and using Taj and playing a couple of those tunes and we did some short tours with him singing. Quickness was recorded with... When the band was kind of broken up. Taj was supposed to sing on it. And it just never came together. And right at that point it always would happen. I mean HR would probably hear on the... Grapevine, that we were recording a record. So he checked in, like, "I hear that you're working on a new record." And Darryl brought him a cassette, the tracks that we'd recorded that had no vocals. HR sat in this hotel room for two days and after two days, he was like, "Okay, I'm ready." He'd written all the lyrics that became Quickness. They got the band back together and they toured again and I think he lasted maybe a month again before he decided to go off and he didn't tour the band again. It's gotten to be a habit. So now he's quit the band three times, it's gotten to be a pattern with HR. This chick was at our audition and said, "I know "the dude that's supposed to sing for y'all." I was at about 21 at this time. I get a phone call and it's Darryl. "No, you can't be serious." He said, "Yeah, this is Darryl Jenifer. "What's going on, man? So I heard you sing, you know. "I'd like you to come on up to Woodstock and jam with us." Turns out he knew a lot of our songs the first day. Soon as we hit off to play any of our covers he knew them right away. And when we heard him we were really excited. He was perfect. In the beginning, there was so much excitement for the whole thing. We went out on the road for like three years. And we spread Rastafari message all over the Earth. Israel's so easy to work with. So easy to be with and travel with. Everything about him was just, it was just magic that way. He was not HR, but he did a credible job. But, you know, it's like, who can replace Mick Jagger? Who can replace John Lennon? By March '94, I got a call from Yauch, saying that we should get back together. He was in LA, saw HR. You know, he's being like a friend. "Come on, man, "you guys, what's you guys' problems?" I'm saying HR's getting on my nerves. He saying, "I'll deal with the fussy problems." I said "Yo, if you see HR, and he wanna do it, "a lot of things go down like that. It's cool, tell him to call me." So next thing you know, my phone rings, he's like, "Oh, hi Darryl, this is HR, "everything's smooth out here, I'm okay. "I met this guy at a show "that want to make a record with us. "His name is Guy Oseary, you should call him." Turns out it's Maverick, it's Madonna, and they want to sign us, they want to sign us fast. It feel like something... Like they'd better get it poppin', quick. And the deal was a great deal. It was so in the band's interest. I mean, they'd really come around on almost every single point. I mean, they went into motion like a... Like a, like a President, like a White House or something, shit was like, contracts, lawyers... Everything just appeared like... You know what I mean, it was just like an operating table. We signed the deal and we got a little money and we got put up in Beverly Hills and we made the record. One of my favorite records at that time was the debut Weezer album which Ric Ocasek produced. And of course he produced my favorite Bad Brains album, which was Rock for Life. And I thought, you know, just let me call this guy and maybe see if he'll produce it. HR never came to a rehearsal. I was taking him to his first rehearsal after they already rehearsed for a week and when we got to the rehearsal area there was a graveyard across the street from it. He wouldn't even go near the rehearsal hall. I had to take him all the way back home. He wouldn't even like set foot in it because it was across the street from a graveyard. He said, "I don't wanna, I don't wanna rehearse, "you know, by the dead." But when he came in the studio to do the stuff, he nailed it every time. He was doing like seven-part harmonies. You know like, right on top of each other. Perfect every time. When we gave them their advance for the album, I got a phone call from a car dealership and the guy wanted to talk to me. He's with HR at a car dealership. So I pick up and I said, "Hi," and he goes, "Oh, I just want to verify, this guy really is "a musician and he really is, you know, has the money." "Yeah, we just paid him an advance, he's got some, "some money, he's on this record label." And he said, "Okay cool, thank you." And I said, "Whoa! Wait." I go... "Out of curiosity, what's he buying?" And he said, I think it was a 1980 limo. A limousine? So um, I said, "Can you put him on the phone?" He puts HR on the phone, I go, "HR! You're buying a 1980 limo?" And he said, "Yeah." I said, "Really?" He goes, "It's beautiful." And I said "Really? Who's gonna drive you?" He said, "Scotty." Scotty is a guy who works at my company who drove him to the car dealership. The guy who works for us, with us, who's not even... Just did me the favor to take him to the dealership. Now he thinks he's gonna drive him in a limo everywhere. HR's behavior started to become increasingly bizarre. And all these things that went down and the particulars involved in this particular advent of our careers is very entertaining. There's no way I can get into the different particulars but it's some of the most entertaining particulars that you will ever hear about a rock band. Bad Brains going to LA on Maverick Records. I remember, one day he walked in with a dead fish in a bra. And cooked the fish in the Maverick kitchen and left it there, after he cooked it. And then just left. When we were at Maverick, we actually got him a... He got him one meeting with a, you know, a doctor to the stars. But you know, he's... He's not cooperative. No one had ever warned me about anything. No one ever warned me that HR had probably schizophrenia, I mean, I don't know that if it's medical or, I mean, I'm not sure, but to me it's... No one had warned be that there is this other character there somewhere. We were lucky enough that the Beastie Boys put the Bad Brains on their tour. Opening night, the tour, I was there with a colleague and we were waiting for them to go on and we were basically high-fiving each other. Like, how amazing is this? We're on the Beastie Boys tour. This is going to be you know, incredible, and we really felt blessed to be part of this. And five minutes of waiting turns into 10 minutes of waiting. Turns into 30 minutes of waiting and then we knew something was wrong. HR would not come off the bus. Well, he said that the authorities and the general didn't address him in the correct fashion and the order of... I'm not even sure what he was talking about. As I was walking him off the bus, he basically started attacking people on the bus. He attacked his brother and Anthony. And I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything like that. They just kinda taped me up. Yeah, yeah, it was, yeah, it was pretty intense, it was a brilliant attack. He was like punching and I couldn't really punch him because I didn't want to hurt him. Because I wanted him to go on stage. So, I can't... I'm not gonna bloody his nose. He's gotta go on the stage. Well, it was... You know, it's hard to even describe it, it happened so fast, like, we were really excited, being huge Bad Brains fans, to have them on our shows, all of a sudden and next thing we hear is like Bad Brains aren't gonna make the next state. "Oh, why not?" "Oh, HR had some problems." Basically, they said, "You can't come back to Toronto," he was expelled 'cause they found some weed on him. That's what got him in the most trouble, not even the fight. And I saw him in a plane, he looked just happy-go-lucky. And it was so funny, man, 'cause... People is... They didn't know, was I losing my mind? I wasn't talking to them, then who was I talking to, the man in the mirror? But see they crawl inside the walls and then hide in the cracks. The snakes and spiders, you know, and iguanas, and I hear 'em in there, moving around and getting, you know, information and... Like I said, I'm grateful those days are over with. Hi, everybody. West Side. East Side... All right. Rastafari. CBGB's was shutting down and everybody in the band knew it was happening and they knew that we really had to play. And we had to go and play shows at CB's, I mean, it was necessary. Bad Brains'll fill the place so easily and we'd done that before many times, three nights in row. I was actually in it for myself, a real honor to be asked to play there three nights. This advent of our career is, it's still like a little stressful, a little, uh... Unpredictable. He had a helmet, which kind of upset me and I thought it like, "What the fuck is this guy on?" We had seen the helmet at rehearsal, so it's like you know, you wanna wear it, that's cool. But just don't wear it the whole night. 'Cause the wireless mike in the helmet was messing up the sound and it was feedback and... There was feedback so that we couldn't even hear the amps and stuff. At CB's when he put the motorcycle helmet on and he had the fucking headset underneath and then the thing, and he's singing from the inside the fucking motorcycle helmet, I mean, we were fuckin' dying, man. The band was still the band, you know, those are my great friends since I'm a little boy and then, there's this guy on stage that's not who he used to be... Sometimes, it's scary HR might be acting a certain way, like HR has got a lot of ways he can be. There are times when what HR does seems irrational to everybody. But it has to do with something that's going on, some kind of dynamic that's going on within his psyche and his psyche is very important to his creativity, and to this band's... Amazing strength. I know I'm not the son of God. I'm not Lucifer, I'm not a demon, I'm not the devil, I don't hate you. Our objective, what we would like to do is entertain, we're live here now in a... On planet Earth. Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Bad Brains! Oh, I think he was sabotaging shit a lot. And that's what a lot of people seem to think too. I mean, I've seen him like almost laughing at the crowd like... And if you don't wanna do it, then don't do it. Don't charge the fans 20 bucks to get in to come to your show. Stay the fuck home. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, you wanna hear some more music? Yes! That's good. Oh, I'm boring now. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm a sissy and a faggot, okay. Anything else you want to remind us about before we play the next song? Well, okay, thank you. I felt like he was disrespecting the audience. In Chicago, I thought he was kind of slacking it or half-assing it, or being a prick to the fans. All right. Aren't we having a divine time? You don't wanna do it? It's no good. Point the cameras in there, this is it, this is it, I can't believe it, all these years. Finally get away from this shit. Gave it my all, man. You're a saboteur, kid. I can't believe... You a sell-out, too, you a sell-out-ass nigga. I been wanting to tell you this forever. You a sell-out, man, I'm telling you. Judas. I got song for you called Black Judas, that's you. So good luck with your life, man. Don't be calling my house and shit, talking about this and that and that and this 'cause I've see you coming to sabotage shit. Play with you amateur-ass niggas, and leave the pros alone, all right. 'Cause the pros will have... Don't give a fuck about you, the pros hold that shit down. I don't care about your little runaway crackhead smiles and shit, man. You're a sell-out, I'm telling you that. Now, I hope I never have to see your ass again. After tonight, you're done. You don't have to make the people feel bad, you don't have to make the youth then feel bad, no more. He's a sell-out, man. Come on, man. Fuck man, he's a sell-out. He even sell you out. He's a sell-out, man. Fucking Judas, man. Bye, Judas. Trying to sabotage much work. We put in and nigga can't even act like he don't want to play and this... Gonna sabotage shit? That's what I told him. I can see if you say, "You don't wanna play? Don't play." Shouldn't come on stage like no pussy. People there spending money and wanna see some energy and have a good time. Trying to fuckin' overcompensate by shaking people's hands and shit like, "Oh, I'm into it, yeah." Shit is no joke, man, when it comes to this shit. I take this shit serious, 30 years, my whole life. You know what I'm sayin'? My whole life. You looking at a motherfucker 47 years old. I've been doing this shit since I was fucking 17, 18, I couldn't even sign a fucking contract to play in a fucking band. I don't want him puttin' me or none of the others through this shit. No, of course not. Fuck that shit, we gonna make good music. We gonna get Israel to come back and blow shit up. All them motherfuckers be leaving here, tripped the fuck out. Judas. Sunfrost. There's several. You want potting soil. There's a lot of different varieties. They range from 2.99 to 5.99. $43.09. I used to always shop here. 'Cause this is the place to be. As you can see. When did I start working here? Um, I'm guessing around 1990 or even... Even '89. There's Gary and I right there. Dos amigos. Gary is in the absolute center of that picture next to me. Right, I saw that. Gary's been instrumental in bringing the forefront of the food consciousness because of his own knowledge and awareness. Gary is such an important part of our life, that... He's the only person that we can trust with our business and when we go away, he's the man. Since he's been gone, back on tour, we haven't had a vacation, 'cause we don't have that trust with anyone but Gary. No pun intended, but people that are in the know are beside themselves, when they find out or figure out or learn that he's here and or who he is. Cool thing about golf, it teach you about a lot of things. Teach you about yourself. No, bad swing. Goin' in the pond. See, I... Look where I hit it, almost out of bounds. A guy the other day, like I was at another golf course, and his niece and them were there and they were like, "Oh, that's Darryl from the Bad Brains." And uh, they didn't want to ask me, you know... They think out here on a golf course, that you don't want to be bothered. It's no big deal, you know, this is kind of confusing, I'm confusing to begin with to be the dread out here. Then when you finally realize, I'm on some rock shit, they just probably say, "Man, that Darryl Jenifer is all over the fucking place." So look like I've missed this one behind the green. What I'm gonna do is, try to use my short game skills. See, if I can chip it in down there. Me and Doc would try to like bring other people into the picture, but Bad Brains chemistry is the original members. The music that we made with other cats is good, too. You know, it's not that that shit sucks, it's that's it's... It's not Bad Brains, it should have been called other things. Bad Brains is a group of dudes from D.C., Maryland, that were blessed with the notion to try to be different and be inventive with their music and actually went as far as to put positive message into the style of music and also went on to cleave and understand other musics that was positive like reggae and also bring that to the same stage at the same time, at the same night. And the Bad Brains is like what Bob Marley was being prophetic about. In one of his songs, he said the Punky Reggae Party. It's a punky reggae party and that's what the Bad Brains is. Oh, yes, we're excited about all our developments. But as always, what we like to encourage people to remember, is it's not what a person can do in violence but it's what they can do in love. Next question, please, sir?
