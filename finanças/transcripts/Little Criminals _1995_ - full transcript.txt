Come on man, your little sister?s gotta watch it too. What sister? - Just keep looking, Cory, will ya? - I looked! Just get what you want... that?s what you?re gonna do anyway. Cory, come on. Hey!

Hey, no hard feelings, OK? Alright? Alright, look. I got a bonus. Mind candy... Have a nice flight. - That guy?s a rip off! - Like you?d know. What you get? Lick ?em ups, want some? Yeah, gimme some. He wouldn?t rip you like that if Stack was standing there. Chet gets what I give him. That stuff could be rat poison. So? I hate junk mail. Times 3 equals 33. Alright, now you look and see where to put the parenthesis. I'm officer Clarke, I'm terribly sorry... We have a problem. Des...! What did he do this time? Last night was quite the party, Des. You gotta wise up, bud. - What? - Last night. - I was doing homework. - Right. Ditto for your pal Stacker. Only he neglected to remember turning 12 last month. That?s why he?s gonna score 6 months in the slammer for the job. You just keep laughing, Des boy. Come your 12th birthday I know 10 cops who'll be at your door with a cake. My buds and me jump you... Pour gas on you, burn your skin off. You only got 6 shots in that gun. We found the dink under the portable, Des. I found him! Shut up! I saw the dink first! Yeah? I got the sticks. Hey baby... What did mommy give you for me today, huh? That?s it? Is that it? Is that it?! Hey, looky looky what I found. You want it? Huh? Maybe it?s got AIDS! What do you think, huh? You want it? 5 bucks tomorrow, right? Don't be a stranger! What's that for? Victory. Hi Mom. Hey... Des. How ya doin? honey? Mom, turn that damn thing down! Brought you somethin?. Hey, that?s sweet of you, Des. Supper's in the kitchen. Why don?t you get yourself something to eat? People are always making up lies about me. Blaming everything on me, shoving me around, it?s not fair. They put that guy in the parking lot, I wasn?t even there. I was home helping my mom, you can ask her if you don?t believe me. You fight good and that?s why you got kicked out of your last school. What?s it to ya? Ever do anything else? So, what are you, man? King Shit? That?s right, hop on. Is this yours? It is now. Ride to school? Screw school, I thought you wanted in. Shouldn?t you boys be at school today? No missus, it?s a professional development day. I could use one of those, so how do you like ?em? Too heavy, maybe the smaller set. Which ones are you after? No, not those ones. Maybe the other ones. Yeah, the ones next to them. What are you doing?! 19... 22... 42... 62... 72... 72. Your share. How come you get all that? You don?t see me wasting time lifting baby toys. What are you gonna do with this crap? Hey, I got something to show you. Like what? Check this. What about ?em? This one says I?m 10, this one 9. It really messes the cops. - They can?t touch me. - For real? Wake up, man. They can?t bust you ?til you?re 12. They can pick you up, but they gotta let you go. Like that?s the law. - How d'you get ?em? - I got ?em. There's this thing going on tonight. You should come. You'll like it. Don't think so. I gotta be somewhere. No fun for you. Piece of crap.

Those are the months. Cory, eat something. I hate rabbit food. Well, it?s good for ya. No, it?s good for him. Why should we go on a diet just cause he does? Come on Cory, this food makes sense. Oh, yeah right. Just finish your meal so we can get to the meeting. OK? And Vince, either take the baby or start clearing up. - Here. - Hey, why should I have to go to the meeting? He?s the drunk. Cory, cut it. That?s old news. Look, if he doesn?t want to go, he should just stay home. We go as a family. Look, there?s no point in forcin? him. Look, stay here if you want, Cory. What do ya say? I hate lettuce. And the pitbull ate her hand right off, and my brother, he like went to my bull pen, and he took out a baseball bat and he started like nailing the dog, and there was like guts all over and this big puddle of blood, and when the cops came after, they, they like thanked him cause they said they were gonna kill him anyway. What are we waiting for? 'til I say so. Check this. Woah, I?m in love. Love sucks, man. You just gotta pop ?em and drop ?em. Well Jamal'd piss himself if he really had to do somethin?. He wouldn?t know where to start. Piss on you. Hey. Des has done it, man. Straight leg, 69, the works. Did he really? But Jamal here, he just gets the pictures, cause he ain?t got the hardware. Eat me. - Say it again. - You heard me. Hey Cory, man. Just in time. Who said he could come? Who says he can?t? Like I said, you ain?t got the hardware. Nick. 31 Frazer. Hey, Mouse. Thanks, just what I needed. How much we gettin?? Enough. - Nick! - You sure? Nick! Make a wish. - Yes! - Woah-ho! - Holy cow! Get out of here! Des, let?s move! Oh, wicked. Des, your arm! Put it out! I got it, I got it. C'mon, back door! Open it! Oh shit! Get out of the way, I?ll do it. Come on, hurry up! Did you get it? There?s more where that came from. Look at ?em! Babies! Sure. I got somethin? for ya. You got me a pager? Not hooked up yet, but it will be. Does this mean I?m in? Good back up. Des, what's this do? Des...! What'd you do that for? Somebody?s gotta do it. Beat the brat to it. Engage! Hey boys... We?re gonna take Bobby to the doctor now. Keep an eye on your sister. Alright, Cory? She?s not my sister. Let?s not argue, just pull your weight, Cory. It?s no problem, we can bring her with us. No! He?s big enough to take some responsibility. We?re gonna be late. Bye. Look... It?s the baby?s first booster shot. Your mom?s kinda nervous about it. So? So, we appreciate you doing this. We? Feed your friend something if he wants it. They?re outta here. Found some food, huh? Play with me, play with me. Play with me. Know what happens if you lose your monkey in the jungle? Sitting there all alone in the dark... Tiger lunch. So, if you want no dead monkey, hang onto it. Hey, Des... Let's start. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy?s gone. Shut up! Hey, I know somethin? we can do. Like what? Fun. Everything went to shit when Vince moved in. Stupid goof. How long has he been around? Ever since he knocked up my mom. At least you?re not stuck in a foster home. Are you? No way, you?d never get me in one of those stinkin? piss holes. Hey, what?s your Dad like? He?s like, dead. Tell me what?s in this picture. The big dog?s coming for dinner. Does the big dog live here? Sometimes. And what?s for dinner? The little dog. It?s taking too long, let?s split. No man, relax, it?s cool. Come on, come on. Let?s just get out of here. She?s in. Come on, over here. C'mon here, the lock. Over here, stupid. Come on, stop, you little spaz, just open the door! Hey Nonny! How?s the monkey doin?? OK. Do you want me to make sure it?s OK? - OK, then you gotta let me in. - OK. OK. Come on, hurry up. OK, come here then. OK, put your hand on the doorknob. OK, see that little twisty thing beneath your hand? Yeah, give that a turn. OK, now open the door. Good job. That?s all of them, let?s go. - Smile. - Hey, turn that thing off! Why not? Seriously, man. You shoot it then. What are you doin?? Thinking. About what? You're nuts, man! Hey, pick it up! That?s worth somethin?! Screw you, asshole. Did I scare ya? Check-out time. - Good haul. - Are we clear? - You know it. - Let?s boot. My monkey! We?re goin? now. I need my monkey! Listen, we gotta go. I need my monkey! Shut up, we gotta roll.

We were getting his sister's toy monkey, you saw it. And how did the monkey get in there? She dropped it. Well, would you look who?s here. Smile! Welcome to the wall of shame, you little nobs. Where are you takin? us? Nowhere, they can?t keep us here. That?s right, smart ass. What are you doing here anyway, hanging with this loser? What happened to my sister? You hear that? He cares about his sister. She's with a social worker upstairs. Man, you really blew this one. Let us go, you can?t keep us here. Not yet, dizzy boy, but when the clock strikes 12, you?re mine. Believe me pal, if you don?t slow down, you?re gonna be dead before you?re 20. Promise? Why do you waste your time with that little shitrat? You ever see where he comes from? It?s like friggin? Beirut. Oh, cry me a river, man. Look, lots of us scrambled out of way worse holes than that little scumbag. Your scumbag is 11. Save it, man. All I want to do is lock the little mutant up. Oh, great! Bust him in kindergarten. Might as well be waiting with a warrant in the delivery room. Can you do that? C'mon breathe it or somethin?, man.** What are they gonna do to us? Nothin?. They got no choice but to let us go. Then what are we still doin? here? They?re just lettin? us stew. Why did you go back, man? We were home free. You?ve never been here before. Yeah, so what about it? My first time here... I pissed my pants. Bullshit, really? Yeah, you could see the puddle and everything. Gross! Yeah, I was like 6. No way. Now, we found the pillowcase of CDs. All we want to know is what you did with the rest of the stuff. We didn?t take nothin?. Oh, you didn?t take nothing, huh? Well, we?ll find out soon enough.

The kid?s already out of control, and it?s just gettin? worse. OK, so what do you want me to do? Tie him up and drag him to work with me? If you can?t handle the kid, then give him up.

You want to wreck the stuff, you?re out of here. See you tomorrow. We just need to take that bandage off and make sure everything's healing nicely. I can?t do it unless you take your shirt off, Des. What happened to your arm there, Des? Nothin?. It looks like you?ve got an infection. It must really hurt. Can I have a look? Is it alright now? I don?t know. We?ll have to wait and see how it heals. Will you let me clean it up? It?s probably wrecked. Would you believe my brother was a card sharp? I guess it's just not in my genes. How did you learn how to do that? Just did. Could you teach me?

Anything you want. Come on, Des. I know you can do better than that. What is that? What do you care? I?m sorry I was in your room, Des. I had no right. - It doesn?t matter. - No, it does matter. Oh yeah? I wish we had more time, Des. Sure. Because your stay here with us will be finished soon. I don?t mind staying. Yeah, but... this isn?t a residence, Des, it's just an evaluation centre. So?
