THE HONOURED SOCIETY This film is a document and an accusation Salvatore Raddusa. To death. Salvatore Muscar?. Burn the grain of admonition. We've already burnt it. Then to death. Salvatore Mazzar?. To death. Salvatore Tropea. To death. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Friends... We've arrived at 7 convictions and are tired. - Tonight's assembly of the Honoured Society is closed. - A moment. With the permission of the head, if for you the sitting is closed, for me no. Do you agree? I have two daughters. And after the daughters of those present, you'd never find better brought up in all of Sicily. Since the age of ten they've never left the house. When they were sick, blind doctors have visited them. And even on Sunday they heard Mass on television. But suddenly there was a fire in the countryside. And without my permission or their mother's, firemen broke through the front door. The girls took advantage of the smoke and fled to Palermo. And two thugs took advantage of them and escaped to the continent! - I want revenge! - Friends... Here is a lesson which must be given. If we continue like this, these hoodlums will come here and seduce our daughters on the very windowsills of our houses! Because, as the proverb says, When the picciotto doesn't give a toss, you can't even save the boss. What does the town hall call these two bastards? - Saruzzo Messina and Rosalino Trapani. - Turiddu! - At your command! - Saruzzo Messina and Rosalino Trapani have fled to the continent. - Seize them dead or alive! - At your command! Salvatore! Saruzzo Messina and Rosalino Trapani escaped to the continent. - Seize them dead or alive! - At your command! They left five black horses Five faces without mercy They wrote above the guns "The honoured society". They left armed to the teeth With a heart full of omert? And were brought to the continent The honoured society Mafia, laws of blood Mafia, laws of honour Laws that break the heart without virtue, without pity. Are you Sicilians? - How did you know? - Looking at this lady, you've cast your eyes too far out! Trezza Salvatore, from Acireale. I saw many statues discovered in Sicily, not to boast, but fulminating like this I never saw. Other companions work around here and I've never been able to determine which is best. And they are clean women! One morning for 500 lire the municipal fountain-keeper had them washed by me! And upon my word, they were never cleaned like that morning! Rosalino! Rosalino! Don't stare for so long! It's not good for you. He's sick! If he concentrates too much on a woman, he faints. Who are you speaking to? Each morning I'm always here. We're such friends that I gave each one a name. This is called Ilde, in honour of the German wet nurse of Baron Salvatore Castroreale of Patern?. This female drives me crazy! Come on, come on! Come on! This one I call Eleonora, a perpetual memory of Princess Baccara of Francavilla Sicula, best known among her fellow citizens with the nickname "frozen meat". Once it's said her swimsuit on the cliff of Lipari could take it no more and split! Get out of here, old hag! Let's go. - One moment, where do you live? - We arrived this morning. Suitcases at the station. - We're pilgrims. - You want to sleep under cover at night? - Preferably. - We'll get your cases. I'll handle it! Let's go! - It's a family hotel and also cheap. - Oh, yes? It has only one defect: you pay. But for two weeks they'll keep you, after that they throw you out. I won't accompany you as my two weeks are already up. See you in an hour. I know some hot tables where you eat like princes. - We eat! Goodbye. Off you go. Little Sicily Anyone in? I've waited two weeks, that's enough! I didn't want to call this "Little Sicily". "Excelsior" I wanted to call it. My husband, this bastard, said there was already an Excelsior in Rome and that, taking advantage of the same name, they'd have taken all of our customers! - Madam, it's not right. - What's not right? Treating him like that. That bastard there. He's a poor dead man. Dead, that one? Who knows! After two weeks of marriage he fled to Marseilles with a chambermaid. - And then he died. - No! He opened a confectioners and is bursting with health! But for me he died and I put him there, for contempt and revenge! So what do you want? First of all, peace and good will. And then a room. But we want to know the price. Two beds, 3,000 lire, all in. - Private bath and linen. - 3,000 lire? - The life of a man... - Life of a man, meaning what? I mean that sometimes, in order to appropriate 3,000 lire, - a thief kills a man. - Sometimes for 2,000. Even 1,000! 1,000 lire only! Listen, robbers' tariffs don't interest me. - Really we're looking for a small room. - Or dark, maybe. There's the next one. 2,500, bathroom and linen extra. Bathroom and linen don't bother us. It's always the price of the room that's the life of a man... So? This room? - We'll take it! - The hotel is worth it. - It's airy! No, the room is on this side. And how long are you staying? Now, let's see... We also have many commitments elsewhere, so... Two weeks. Hotlegs... I've been waiting for you... And you exist. Are you one metre 90 or am I not feeling well? - Yes, I'm one metre 90. - Hotlegs, I've been looking for you. In my country, women are one metre, one metre 10. - You sheltered here because it's raining, right? - Indeed. We too. Many people, when it rains, shelter. - When do we see you again? - But really... Every time I embrace a woman I always had to make sure she didn't fall off the stool. Instead you up to here, with your feet on the ground like me. It's true. I've never met a man as tall as me either. Well now, believe me. I've looked for you since I started growing. But you don't speak Italian like me. Where are you from? - I'm from Turin. - Ah, from Turin! My uncle has a car that was made in Turin. Destiny was already preparing us for this meeting. And you want to resist love? Deluded fool! - Maria, let's go, it's stopped raining. - Wait a moment. - Who are those two women, one on the other? - My sister. Well, goodbye. Tomorrow night at 9:00. I heard "Tomorrow night at 9:00." Did it come from inside? - No, from her. And you know where? - No. At their house. At their house? At their house! And who sleeps tonight? Mamma mia, these women will be the death of me! But what do they want from us? At their house! - Nothing, they're French, that's enough. - They're from Turin. And what is Turin? Isn't it half French? Rosalino, Did you smell how perfumed they were? Good! You know what? For Italian prestige tomorrow we'll have to wash at any cost! At their house it won't be us arriving. But they'll get get... two flowers! How beautiful is cleaning Said the Catanese You'll have to wait a few minutes, it's busy. Two poor wretches have been here for an hour! What are they up to? What are they doing in there? What are they washing? You like being under hot water, eh? You're here at 10:30 and it's noon! "How beautiful is cleaning," said the Catanese. Thank goodness for what he said! Rosalino, I've told you before: Don't dwell on the socks! Socks can be dried on your feet with human warmth! It's the shirts that show up when they get wet! By the way... Listen... Given that some important documents have been creased in our suitcase, could you lend me an iron? I don't know nothing, I saw no one pass by. Give me the fan. Saruzzo, have you thought about what we must bring for tonight's festivities? You're right. They are free women, but we must always stun them first. I'll bring Marsala all'uovo, so the Marsala stuns them - and the egg is good to us. - No! Marsala is slow and is drinkable. We need something that takes effect quickly. Anisette... Anisette is fast-paced! Internal 17. It's here. I told you the shirt collars needed more fanning. Now who knows when they'll dry! Now we have to take off our shirts. Good evening. - Good evening. - Finally! - You're right on time. What a delightful home! Hotlegs, all day today I've missed you. - When do we come back next time? - But you've only just arrived! Yes, yes, that's true! We've only just arrived! Don't shout. - Come into the lounge. - Let's go to the lounge. What a delightful lounge! My father. My mother. My grandfather. My grandmother. My aunt. My Uncle Salvatore. My brother Salvatore. My cousin Salvatore. My cousin Antonietta. Make yourself at home! You're Sicilians? And you... how do you come to be French? Well, we were born in Turin, before transferring to Rome. Make yourself at home! What do you earn? - When do we earn? No, What do you earn! With a T! Eh... we don't know. - We... we never count. - We never count anything. - You are Saruzzo and you Rosalino. - You already know our names? Now you have to buy 10 candles right away and go light them in front of the statue of Santa Rita. I'm sorry, but we can't please you. You ask for something impossible. We, in our country, are devoted to Santa Rosalia even when we blaspheme. All right. Go and light them at the statue of Santa Rosalia. But why do we have to light them? Because you've had the fortune to happen upon our family and the two golden daughters you take! But you too must be good young men for right away - you have presented yourself at home. - Right away... - Naively... - When are you getting married? - What? When! With an N! Who knows... Destiny is in God's hands. No! You have to get married right away because the females in our house are like a pan of stew. They boil over at the slightest opportunity. But you must also think of the side dish. Fortunately for you there are no money worries. - Do you know who you're talking to? - Who? You talk to Tarocco Zappal?! The only tarocco wrapped in cellophane paper! My company has in hand all the Sicilian oranges eaten in England! If one morning I say, "Enough" the next day no one in England eats any more oranges. - But you don't say, "Enough." - It's not worth my time! As I said, it enough for me that you love them. And I know you love them! For the rest, I'll take care of it. House with panoramic view, trousseau of 24 place settings. First class wedding with reception at the Grand Hotel. Honeymoon in England where we have a branch office. A car made in Turin, I specify it because they make them well there. A share in the profits of Tarocco Zappal?, a bonus of 2 million for each male child and 700,000 for each female. He said 500, but I dragged him to 700. And then, after all, marriage isn't a death sentence, it's a life sentence! And you can always escape. And then for me... Rosetta... Isn't too bad. And I also think we made a good impression. - Those two wretches, bastards, dead beats in my house! - Calm down. In my house! You understand? In my house! You're right, calm down! It's late and next door the baron always complains. You think only of the baron and not about saving my face? You don't think about my dishonour? - I do think about it! - You don't! - Is it my fault? - No, is it mine? So it's my fault? Who first invited them into this house, the De Mandrillis brothers? And what did I know? They looked like two nice boys. The blame is on these two hussies, who couldn't save their honour. - Don't shout, think of the baby... - It's my fault, huh? Yes, because 20 years ago you could have saved my honour! No woman wants to save her honour! They look for the opportunity and you give it them! And now that Romulus and Remo De Mandrillis have vanished in Switzerland, you put salt on their tails! Salt on their tails! Alright! Now Santa Rita has sent us the other two. Understand, they may not be princes, but fall guys they are. Fall guys they are and I have to respect and entertain them, 'cos two months after we arrived and with our backs to the wall! Leave me! Leave me! Who is it? Who is it? Who could be so lousy as to make you cry? We haven't got a penny and we don't know anyone here. The landlady has kicked us out saying that one day of us is worth two weeks of one single customer. I don't understand a thing, but you don't want to cry for so little? Let them pass. Sorry if the stairs are occupied, but lady... Continue! Trust me, lady! The hotelier has not too kindly thrown me out and my poor girls! And why did the hotelier do this? Because our agent has run off with the lead dancer. - They both ran away... - How could I imagine that our agent would run off with the lead dancer? But is this a reason to end up on the stairs? Yes! Because we were left without a single lire and without knowing anyone. The hotelier says that only one day here without paying is worth two weeks of one other customer. So she said that? Now I'll think about it. Allow me. Call your mistress. I don't know nothing, I saw no one pass by. Call your mistress, or I'll eat you up! What is it? What's this all about? We found them on the stairs! Well? They're from good families and you treat them like this? And who knows their families? I knew their agent, who ran off with the lead dancer! And now who'll have them dance? No one! I'll be dancing next week, when they haven't paid me! Reopen the rooms right away. - The ladies... belong to me. - All? - All! - I'll answer for them! - But how? I'll call them by name and you'll answer? But do you know Tarocco Zappal?? - Zappal?, with the oranges? - Yes, oranges! Tarocchi are the oranges that go to England. Zappal? is my father-in-law. And if he says one morning, "Enough" the British are done with oranges! Done with them! They can do what they want, change government, call the Queen, nothing, done with them! We won't even send them one! Not a single one! And what do I care? - Pipe down! What have oranges got to do with them? - Them? Because when I say, "I answer," it's not me, it's Zappal?. Let's not discuss it further. In fact, call... Call 322296. Zappal? is awful. He sees with our eyes. Sometimes he wants us to call to make sure we're fine. Hello? Zappal?? One moment. Hi, dad? Who is it? Saruzzo! I'm calling from the Excelsior. I do it to spite that bastard there. I'm fine. Rosalino too. Take care of yourself. Good night and sweet dreams! Take care of yourself! Well, haven't you opened the rooms yet? Open them. Girls, these darlings have fixed it up. They're opening our rooms, we can stay after all. - How sweet! - Thank you! Thanks a lot! Divest yourselves. See you later! Make yourselves comfortable. Divest yourselves! But what did I do? What did I do to deserve all this plenty? Rosalino, what did we do to be rewarded so? I respected my parents, helped old ladies across the street! Me and the animals? Like brother and sisters we were! Now I understand why I had all this blessing! My chubby cheeks! From Palermo they send the mail across the mountains, cities and sea They arrive as far as the capital The honoured society. Inside churches, palaces, monuments with the usual calm and seriousness Preparing the final appointment The honoured society Mafia is laws of blood Mafia is laws of honour Laws that break the heart without virtue, without pity What is it? Next door, they're arguing. - They're newly weds. - Newly weds? Why didn't you wake me before? Rosaria, I told you: This bridal dress has too long a train. Too long! But why is it my fault, if after we took the portrait my foot got tangled in your train? I fell on the steps of the church and broke my damn leg. Is my fault if I broke my damn leg? You're right, I agree. But it upsets me too much. Tonight, I must ask you to go sleep somewhere else. Rosaria, what's that? Is this what one asks on the first night of marriage? Is this what one asks? No! I'm sorry, but I can't do what you ask! I married you! And you know that in our country two elope and then marry! - I married you without eloping! - You're right. But that white leg makes me uneasy. - Why? What is it, my uncle, the canon? - Yes! It's as if we were me, you and your uncle the canon! If it had happened before, the marriage would have been postponed. It could be the voice of God saying, "I'm breaking your leg so as not to marry Rosaria." Then the voice of God would have broken them both! Instead it happened after, the train tickets were already bought! Second class! With the coffee flask and macaroni omelet in the suitcase! There's no going back. No going back. One broken leg... What's a broken leg with all the trouble in the world? You will see that you'll gradually get used to it. Maybe even grow to like it. And when I take the cast off, you'll be sorry. Like when your cousin Rosalia left for Australia. You're right... but tonight go sleep somewhere else. - You'll see, tomorrow it'll be all over. - But what tomorrow? If they find out in Sicily I was kicked out on my wedding night, when we return, there'll only be two places I can hide: in the Scylla and Charybdis waste depot or the public lavatory in Piazza dell'Unit? d'Italia. Hear me, Rosaria, hear me! Let's get this barricade out of the way and do as if we were in your barn at home. Do you remember... Remember how you loved me in your barn? You're right, but in the barn I felt at home. Here on the continent in the capital, and with that thing between us. Salvatore, have pity. - I'm away from my parents. - And me? Aren't I far away from mine? You don't pity me, huh? What a love story... How moving. Hotlegs... Salvatore, make me happy, let me get through the shock of tonight. Tomorrow I'll be brave and sleep with you. Go, or I can't take it and I'll throw myself out of the window. And then I'll be dead! Okay, I'm leaving. I'm leaving! And where will I go at this hour, with a broken leg and a shoe that's too tight? I'll sit on the bog. On the bog! - But this isn't the toilet. - No, it's our room. Lucky you noticed in time. Sorry, but tonight I can't think straight. - We know. - Make yourself at home! Smoke? - It's no bother. - No, thank you. He told me: This dress has too long a train. "Too long". Pride has ruined me! All to make the train longer than the dress of Marquis Lopez's daughter! If I'd made my train as long than that of the daughter of Don Salvatore the butcher, after we'd taken the portrait, his foot wouldn't have got entangled and we wouldn't have set off with that strange leg along! Tomorrow she'll get over it and apologize to me. Meanwhile my first wedding night... is... going up in smoke. And to think that with my old schoolmates, we were imagining it in all its details since we were 12 years old! And who'd have thought I'd be spending it with who? With you. The problem is not this. Have you thought about your friends hearing of this? Have I thought of it? Of course! And I've just told Rosaria. If word gets out in Sicily that I was driven out the first night, when we return, there are only two places I can hide: in the Scylla and Charybdis waste depot or the public lavatory in Piazza dell'Unit? d'Italia. Indeed, there would be the sewers beneath Aragonese castle. Yeah, that's true! The sewers beneath Aragonese castle, right! Isn't a nice place to go hide your face the dirty water channel behind the prison laundry? Fantastic! Fan-tast-ic! But I say, has a legitimate bride the right to kick out her husband the first night of the wedding, even with a broken leg? - What does the law say? - Oh, I don't know. I've always dealt with embezzlement, false pretences, impersonation, forging official documents. Such romances are not my affair. For me she can't kick you out, unless... Unless you disgust her. Do you disgust her? What do I know? I don't know. In her stable we wanted each other! It can be a sudden disgust. How long will it last? There's permanent disgust and one that passes. But this must be a disgust... that passes. - And how do you realise that? - I'm not mistaken. Come with me. Come. Here we are! What do you want to drink? - Poison. - Poison's finished. This stuff was sent by our father-in-law Zappal?. - Drink it. - Yes, but what does it solve? You need it because now you have to go back to the barricade. Drink! Now, say after me: Man, be a man! - Man, be a man! - Drink! - It's too much. - How do you feel? - A little better. - So drink it. Now, say after me: White, red and green, victor or has-been! White, red and green, victor or has-been! 1, 2 and 3, my wife belongs to me! 1, 2 and 3, my wife belongs to me! A, B, C, you are my wife, come to me!! A, B, C, you are my wife, come to me! March, April, May and June, my courage is coming soon! March, April, May and June, my courage is coming soon! Tricolor is flying high, now or never, do or die! - Man, be a man! - Man, be a man! Charge! - Salvatore, what's this? - A man! 1, 2 and 3, my wife belongs to me! Salvatore, wait! A, B, C, you are my wife, come to me! Salvatore, be reasonable! I don't want to go to the Aragonese castle sewers! - Salvatore, have mercy, go away - No. If this thing gets out, I'm left with Scylla and Charybdis or the Unit? d'Italia! Rosaria, come here. Don't make me angry. My leg! - Rosaria, my leg! - What is it? Did I hurt you? - Yes. - Where? - Here. Let me go! Come on. Come on... Hello! They were so sweet and juicy we ate them all! What a wonderful tie? Did you buy it in Italy? The colour goes with your eyes and your hair... You look wonderful! Silky and so refined too... In short, did you like the Zappal? tarocchi? Zappal? tarocchi? - What's that? I don't argue the high nutritional content of your oranges, but I'm very... But what are you, chubby cheeks? What are you? - Very concerned. - And why? Today we've been here for two weeks and my girls haven't yet danced. And what do we do each night? Don't we let them dance? But just for you! If we can't familiarise ourselves first, how can we get you signed up. But it's been two weeks familiarising yourselves. The hotelier doesn't understand a thing and wants to be paid. And we will pay! If we paid the others, we'll pay her too! Anyway, I invited some great Milanese impresarios to Rome. They must be arriving any moment now. Rosalino, did you inquire this morning at the desk if there were impresarios for us? - Not yet. - Alright then. We'll find out. But, darling, you don't have to worry, if not you'll waste away. And you'll no longer be my chubby cheeks! We're leaving and I advise: Don't let me slip on any orange peel. No dragging yourselves around by your hair and no scratching each others faces. - So, no worries? - Bye-bye! - What do you want, rooms? - Two rooms... Mortuaries. I understand, you want to save. We've a room without light, without air and without heating. Well, let's go, it seems our many commitments... are waiting. Excuse me. Enough! Who is it? Honoured Society. You wanted to get away with it? But they've condemned you to death. To death? Picciotto, there's a misunderstanding! We're two Zappal?s. No, you are Saruzzo Messina and Rosalino Trapani. The daughters of Don Salvatore Verit? were seduced by you. And you hid on the continent. But we found you and a price on your head. Price? We're not paying anything. There was a misunderstanding We are two authentic Zappal?. No, it's true! This is Saruzzo Messina and this is Rosalino Trapani! Two weeks ago they came and in their seduced girlfriends' room I heard them talking! You understand? It's now you must say "I don't know nothing, I saw no one pass by." On our behalf you've said more than the town hall clerk! - Mercy... Mercy... - Mercy... This, the board must decide. To Sicily we must bring you back, Alive or dead! No, no, alive, alive! Let's go. Allow us to take our garments? Garments? What's that? Continental word. It means "clothes". - Are there other doors here? - No! All right, but hurry. So... excuse me. Excuse me. Darling, come here. They're back, what do they want? You explain that the Milan ballet impresarios have arrived. Go to welcome them. Girls! five ballet impresarios have just arrived from Milan! Go and make them welcome! Hurry! Move! - Wonderful men! - Our heroes! But... - Wretches, what are you doing in my room? - Quiet. What did you do last night in our room? Here is my wife in bed! You're not married. Cover yourself. And what does that mean? Because one's not married, he has no right to spend the night in peace? - Why are you leaving? - Mind your own business! Go, be a man! Be a man. 3, 1, 2, your wife belongs to you! You've helped them escape and put yourself against the Honoured Society. - Now, your death awaits. - Young man, what are you saying? Do you think I'd put myself against the Society? Rosaria, cover up. And who knows those two? - The sheets are theirs! Mine are here! - Death awaits. How can I go to my death with a broken leg and can hardly move. Rosaria, cover up! With the Honoured Society one does not joke. If we find them, you're saved, if not, you're dead. Half a portion of spaghetti, half bollito and potatoes, minestrone, pasta and beans, gnocchi, large potato, pasta squares, angel hair in broth, fettuccine! - I was waiting for you. - How did you know we were coming? - Today gnocchi! - You have to help us. We must hide. - Why? - The Honoured Society are looking for us. In the capital? You're exaggerating! No, this morning five have come to the hotel. Santa Rosalia made us escape. Now we can't go back. There's the house of Salvatore Gioia. Tonight there's an empty room: His brother-in-law has gone elsewhere. - Somewhere better? - Didn't you know. He's dead. But if he knows who's is looking for us, won't he be afraid? We'll tell him it's the cops, so it's his duty to hide you. Why are we here on this Earth? Why? Courage, ma'am. Sooner or later we all have to die. - Let's get out of here. - But where? Don't you see, that alley's as blind as us? Salvatore... Salvatore... No answer. The pain you've given me is not inconsiderable. No, it's not inconsiderable. What did you lack? Did you lack something? He doesn't answer. Because he lacked nothing. He wanted meat? And I gave him meat. He wanted the eggs? And I gave him eggs. He digested stones! He once told me: "I want to taste a couple of mushrooms". He liked then fried. Garlic, oil and parsley. I made three kilos, and while he ate them, the farmer came from the village in a police car. They were poisonous mushrooms. Not even a hiccup! This angel had eaten every last one. And not even a hiccup! Now I'm wondering, how could you die without saying a word to your family? What does it matter if one dies? The important thing is one's health. - Hotlegs, let's kiss. - Stop, Antonietta can see us! - Hotlegs, I'm thirsty. - We have the beer in the fridge. But don't you understand? I'm thirsty for you. And only your kiss can calm me as your mouth refreshes like lemonade. Marry you, yes, but... not tomorrow. Why not? - First we must compare characters! - Compare them? And what do you want? What side do you eat on, on the left or on the right? On the left. And with salad do you like lemon or vinegar? - With vinegar! - We are the same! Hotlegs, don't refuse. Get off, it's Antonietta! - What do you want? - Did you hear it? It sounded good. So much so that I'm sorry you finished. Now I have to do my homework. Did you solve the problem? - I looked, but I don't know. - But how? If a trader has bought 150 meters of cloth... - I don't know a thing! Last week there was the calculation to know how many tiles are needed for 15 bathrooms of all sizes. Now the trader. Today you want to know this, tomorrow that. If he's a serious trader, get an accountant, don't bother me? - I told you, it's division! - I don't know how to do it! When I was elementary school, we came to multiplication. Then the teacher cracked her head and didn't go any further. - Didn't the substitute come? - Yes, but I cracked her head too and they dragged me off to juvenile prison! - And I hope to hear the same of you. - It doesn't matter to me, school, 'cos when I grow up I'll be a pianist. And when you grow up? - An executioner. - And do you have to study? I'm studying. Let's leave it a few more weeks. - You can't. Our days are numbered! - What do you mean? Do you want to know? So be it! I'm excited. This is the most beautiful moment for a bridegroom. - Expecting... a child. - And how do you know? It's not true. I said so to convince you to get married right away, to hurry our honeymoon in England. Rather... it's true. I'm expecting a child. Expecting a child... who comes from outside, - perhaps Antonietta's companion. - No, I'm expecting a baby... Coming from inside. - A child of mine? - Who else's? - And how was that? - What do I know? I'm very delicate. It would be... a lingering look perhaps. Did you hear? Did you hear? Yes, we heard. Antonietta, shut yourself in your room. It's an hour we've been here, you've left it late. Well then... so it's like this. You two have abused the trust I had in you, to bring dishonour to my family! What's this? I don't understand. Dad, things happen when goodness is too strong. Right now Rosetta told me she's very delicate and that it may have been a lingering look. And I, knowing myself well, I think this was the reason. - And you, how did it happen? - But what? - They too looked at each other intensely? - Explain it to me. Do you want to be a jerk, for not marrying her? No, if one thing's certain it's this: We have to marry urgently. No, you must marry right now! No, right now, no. We have to marry im-me-dia-te-ly! With the sun and the north wind And hearts filled with omert? Returning once more to Sicily The Honoured Society With the return of five black horses Five faces without pity They're gathered ready to condemn The Honoured Society Mafia, laws of blood Mafia, laws of honour Laws that break the heart Without virtue, without pity Yes, the gasoline consumed this year was too much, but after all, you understand: Revenge is revenge. We can't burn down houses with cold water. Betrayal! Saruzzo Messina and Rosalino Trapani. On the continent we found them. Dead or alive we've brought them! Here they are! Don Salvatore, don't, please. Let's sit down. Yes, let's sit down. Finally. We still have our feet, but can't feel them any more. Show a little patience, you'll soon be at rest. If possible, a long rest. Eternal. Don't you think you're exaggerating? Don Salvatore, now I come to you. There have been two offences here: One to you and another through your esteemed person to the Honoured Society. And since two offences were done, two satisfactions must be given: One to you and the other to the Honoured Society. - To you redress is with a wedding. - It's too little! - It's too much! - Let me finish by requesting. For us... redress is with death. - It's too much! - It's too little! Long live, long live the couple that on this day have said yes. And long live, long live the couple, - A hundred of these days and heartfelt sympathies! - Thank you. Sincerest wishes and may God welcome you into the ranks of the angels. You too and all your esteemed family. On this happy day I join in your sorrow. Extendable also to your relatives. - Thank you. The same and worse also to your loved ones. Happy wishes. And, as is said in the moment of misfortune - hatred is set aside. Rest in peace. - Rest in pace. Thank you for the extreme honour you do me. I will pray for you. And I hope to have you close by as soon as possible. There's no light! Consiglia, Adalgisa! We've just lost the light that our friends need. Go get the four biggest candlesticks and light them where our friends are. Don Salvatore, under your favour I would like to say a couple of words. May I? - Speak, you are at home. - I would like to remind those present that this is a marriage, not a mortuary. Understood? Then dance. The first dance is in honour of the bride and groom. Maestro, cheerful! Cheerful! Hotlegs, dancing this tango I remember and I'm sorry. Rosalino, what are you saying? You know I can't hear you down here. Nothing. I said you are finally my better half. Help yourself! Rosalino, you see that wedding cake? That wedding cake... is us. Now that the light is back on, one must laugh. Maestro, on with the comics. I said the comics. Time for a laugh. But we didn't bring any comics. A wedding celebration without comics? Saruzzo and Rosalino know some ridiculous songs! - At the feast of Santa Rosalia I saw them! - Oh, very good! This time the comics... are the spouses in person. Get on stage and make us laugh! - But really... - For now... with our private business we're not so willing. I said make us laugh! - Do you really want to laugh? - Yes. We want to laugh right now. Right now. Kindly request, "Can I come up". Passing through Cassaru, Oh, what a sight I saw A lady, very likeable I set out on her trail. In the via dei giudici Through an entrance I slipped by. I followed her like a fool, I even go in and push. Oh, signora, don't be alarmed. She asks me: "Can I come up". No! Where are you going? - Nowhere. We were doing the theatrical exit. - Exiting the stage. Too soon. Tomorrow morning, you'll exit the stage! Definitively. - Don't hurt us. - Don't shoot us. We'll aim well, you won't feel a thing. It's not possible, it's well known: When they shoot someone, they always feel pain. - Mercy! - Do it for my widowed mother! Do it for my old father! - Saruzzo is right! - Papa! Shooting hurts! The only son I have left. - I lost a son in Africa! - In which battle? - What does he say? - In which battle? - I don't understand. - In which battle? Pneumonia. No way! They offended the Honoured Society And so death. Bastards, we're ready! What is your final wish? Before the final journey... a little wedding honeymoon. No. - Mourners, get outta there! - No! Stay with us! Give us courage when the bullets fly! - But will they really shoot! - What is it? You are our wives! We must stay together! Wives, get outta there! Aim! Fire! Bastards, you did it to frighten the horses! Dismount! Dismount! Aim! Fire! - Halt! - Who's there? Salvatore Zappal?! For Don Salvatore Zappal?, remove your caps. To what do we owe this honour? I need Saruzzo Messina and Rosalino Trapani. My two daughters, they came to dishonour. And escaped from the altar. And dead, under the same altar must return! Saruzzo Messina and Rosalino Trapani are already reserved. Reserved? Are they train seats? They've insulted The Honoured Society. - And we must wash clean the offence. - They've insulted me too. - And, washing my offence, I modestly wash yours too. - He's right! Don Salvatore, I don't like talking to you. This washing of yours won't do. Don Salvatore, I must remind you that big shot though you are, modestly, such a big shot am I. Our wine, when taken far away, loses its taste and flavour. It's one thing being a big shot here and another being a big shot there. - But where? - On the continent! When things are so, I must tell you, with all due respect for you and for The Honoured Society present, that if you don't give me these two bastards right away, The young men here behind me know their duty and will begin to shoot. The Palermo hospital was built for this. Allow me five minutes to get rid of these innocent souls. Take your time. OK! Get outta here! Rosalino, I told you once: Marriage is not is a death sentence, it's a life sentence! And from that, as you can see, one can always escape! - We're here! - Who's there? The Verit? sisters!
