This film was shot at original locations of X-jam Croatia on Lanterna Peninsula School is over! Each year thousands of young adults meet to celebrate for an entire week. A party they will never forget. PARTY HARD, DIE YOUNG GROUP BEST CLASS EVER Cheesy, no one wants to know where your room is. Nice hat, class rep. Down it, or you won't get laid. Ha, you can't handle it! Dude, you guys are so gay! Shut up, Barbie! Look what a nerd I am. Uhh, our own bloggers. #victim #lowbrow #instavictim Indulgence! How am I supposed to survive this week? Is someone hung over? Look, drink something! -Yuk, Julia! Hey, I have to tell you something. You reek! Could you please brush your teeth? Mom again... Come on, give it to me! Hello, Renate. This is Julia. Jessy's in the shower. Of course it's just the two of us in a room. We'll be careful with the alcohol. Don't worry. Sure, I'll watch out for her. Ok, bye! She sends her love. Thank you! I'll be so relieved to finally be back in Vienna with you. I've got something for us. Taadaa! -What is it? I stole it from my mom's medicine cabinet. Whoa! -It's for tonight! You know, I'm moving to Vienna, too, in the fall. In case you need another flatmate. I can help you shower every day. Samy? -No, thanks. Why are you even here if you don't drink? I have my reasons. -Oh, Samy has secrets. Not everyone's here just for the drinking and banging. Really? You know, fat-camp is somewhere else. Get that thing out of my face. Are you deaf or what? Give me back my phone, stupid cow! Are you class 8B from Keimgasse high school? Looks like you feel right at home already. My name's Felix, this is Leo. We just have a brief update for you: The big beach party starts at 8 pm down here. The parties at the arena start at midnight. After that, the beach is closed, for everyone. What? Why? -We can't change it. We have 8 wristbands for the first secret party tomorrow night. But we're more than 8. -There's 11 of us. No worries, we'll have more wristbands for the other parties. Any questions? Is it true that you team members aren't allowed to hook up with the graduates? First of all, that's true. Secondly, we're a gang, not a team. And you are? -First of all, I'm Alexia Schober. Secondly, friends and gang members call me Lexi. Friends call her "Licksy". Have a great week, and if you have questions, come by the info point, ok? Have fun! -Bye! They're so hot! Who gets a wristband? Each girl gets one. -Great idea. You gentlemen can fight for the rest. -No way! I would suggest that every girl who blows me gets one! How about it, Andi? -Stop! You really have to tell her. -What? Come on, everyone knows you're going to Munich and not to Vienna. I know... It won't get any easier. 8B, 8B, 8B! And here are the best 'Pics of the Day'! Somebody was feeling hot. He dumped his wife. Here is some involuntary body painting, proving that there really is only one thing on your mind. Hey, that's me! I dare you to fall asleep near me. -That's not going to happen soon. Cool, now you're the most popular dick around here! Want a drink? -Yes. This "genital" artwork is the perfect transition to a message that is really important to me and your parents. You can't stress it enough with you young people: Please, always use sunscreen with SPF 50. That guarantees that this will be a week you will never forget. And how does it go? -X-Jam! X-Jam! X-Jam! Cheers! -Cheers! The next round's on me! I'd rather you invite me to Oktoberfest when you've moved to Munich. Why? Didn't you and Jessica want to move to Vienna? Munich? I passed the entry exams! Great! Thanks, Bogi. Jessy, I'm really sorry. How long have you known? -For a week or so. You've told Bogi, but not me? I really wanted to tell you, but you would've been mad the entire week. So now it's my fault? -No, but if it's so important to you... ... then I just won't tell her and let her die stupid? Jessy, come on. This is just about a stupid apartment. Fuck the apartment! That's not what this is about. I thought we trusted each other. Calm down! What was I supposed to do? I told you from the beginning that I'd try to get in. Just because you want to share a stupid flat, I can't... I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Sure you did. In the end you always do what benefits you most. You know what? Fuck "best friends"! Jessy, come on. Jessy, stop it! That's really stupid. Why? Are you worried you'll have to take care of me? Give that to me! Great! Well done! -Shit, I'm sorry. Here, take it. Have fun! Is she still mad? I'm sorry. It just slipped out. Who cares? I can't plan my whole life around her. What is that? Julia, be careful with that stuff! Leave me alone, Bogi! Are you feeling good? Yes. I can see that. I feel fantastic! Want to go outside and drink something? Water? Yeah? Come on! You all right? Are you sure? Shit! Please, leave me alone! Morning. Did you sleep here? Yeah, Lexi brought a guy back to our room. Should I have joined them? And what about Jessy? She wasn't here. She was standing over there. And that's where the guy came from. Shouldn't we call the police? -The police? Why? To report it. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but do you even know how you got home last night? You were lying over there and you didn't look like you knew what was going on. -You took me home? Felix for Nadja, please. Sorry. Felix, here. Hi, this is Jessica. Leave a message after the beep. Hey, you faggot, get up! Dude, you're the gay one! Fag! Morning! I hear you have a sick sunburn? -Yes, I do. Thanks! Cheesy, scoot over. -Sit down! I need to get Leo's number. Who? -That guy is so hot! Look, 177 likes. Awesome! You guys went on the roof? Are we allowed up there? No, Leo almost sent us home. Luckily, Lexi had some strong arguments to convince him. What did you do, give him a blowjob? Well... -Blowjob? I've come just in time. You'll never come with any of us, Cheesy. Not for real, anyway. Cheesy, are you done anytime soon? Yeah, wait. I'm almost done showering. Morning! Hey, did you guys see Jessica? Hey, has anybody seen Jessica? Guys, have you seen Jessica? -Did you check her bed? Seriously? She's disappeared and isn't answering. I've looked everywhere. And I saw her in the forest last night. Something was off. She was with some guy who attacked her. What kind of guy? -He had a weird face. Calm down and listen. She just sent me a text. "I'm in Rovinj with ..., don't worry about me. As long as we don't run out of condoms ;)" Fucking! Jessica would never write that. Are you jealous because she texted me and not you? What if she's still mad about the fight yesterday, and that's why she didn't text? Can I read that again? Seriously? Look! That fat cow is wearing the same bikini as I am. I'm going to make her pay. It suits her better than you. -Really? It really suits her. -Then go fuck her. It really does. Sorry, but what's wrong with Jessica wanting to have some fun for once? Jessica is still a virgin. Do you really think she would just take off with some random guy? To Rovinj? And who is "dot, dot, dot"? Well, it wouldn't be the first time Jessica has run away. Hey, that virgin thing stays between us, ok? We have a winner! It's Stefan, our 'King of X-Jam'! A round of applause for Stefan! And the tension is rising for the girls. These girls signed up to become the 'Queen of X-Jam'. Laura and Sophie! Third is Belli. Then there is Angi. Angi! And last but not least: Carmen! Where's Carmen? Carmen Hipfl, please. -There she is! Carmen, you don't have to go up there. Ok, if she's not coming, no problem. -Hold this! There she is! Give it up for Carmen! Give it up for Carmen! Give it up! Hi Jessy, uh... ... please call me back. I'm so sorry. I wanted... I don't know. I... well... So if you're in Rovinj then... ... please call me back. I get that you don't want to be with me right now, but... But please call me, ok? I'm worried about you. Hey guys, what's up? I'm at the X-Jam Secret Party and it's really... Should I ask him to film us? Maybe we'll become YouTube stars. Just leave him alone. I didn't think Carmen had it in her. Amazing! Hey Denise, come up to the roof! Surprise ;) Kisses, Jessy I have to go somewhere. -And where is "somewhere"? Denise? Stop fucking around, Jessica. I can hear your phone. Come on, quit it. Julia is really worried about you. It's not funny anymore. Seriously? New video received What the fuck? Julia! Julia, help! Help! Cheers! It's Denise! There's not much I can tell you. The police think this was an accident. That's all we know for now. I understand if some of you want to go home. We will take care of the cost, of course. If you have any questions, Felix and Leo are here for you. My condolences. How can someone just fall down from there? Or how she even got up there. -She's been up there before. Do you think she committed... I mean... -No, why would she? There's no use in speculating. As class rep, I would say... ... everyone who wants to leave says so now. I'm not going home before Jessy comes back. Maybe something happened to her, too. Come on... Well, I don't want to stay. I'm going home. Do you think Denise would have wanted everyone to go home? Do you want to party like nothing happened? I definitely don't. Great! Even now she manages to screw up everything. What a terrible thing to say. You think now that you're 'Queen' you can do whatever you want? Sorry, it just kind of slipped out. And it's kind of true. I'd say that the people who want to go home come to the info desk in two hours, and we'll book tickets for the evening ferry. Jessy, please call me back. Something terrible has happened, and I'm worried about you, ok? Call me back. Kisses. Hello, this is the mailbox of Denise Petrovic. I'm not available right now, but please leave a message after the... Felix? Julia, how are you? I wanted to ask if you know whether they found Denise's phone on her? As far as I know, they didn't. Why? Could you do me a favor? If anyone finds out that I let you up here, I'll be in big trouble. She got a text and was really secretive about it. And I just got a picture from her. You got a picture from her? Let's go, before anyone sees us. Come on, please! Is it Denise's? No idea. Julia, let's go, please! Come on. Hey. -Hey, Samy. Are you coming to our memorial service? -Of course. Shit. Can you say something for once? Honestly! I mean... Julia, calm down. Sorry. To you, Denise! To you, Denise. -To you, Denise. What are you still doing here? Didn't you want to go home? There was no more room on the ferry. I'll take the one in the morning. Why are you this late? -I went to the police. The police? -Yes. I didn't imagine the thing with Jessica in the forest. I got pictures on Snapchat of Jessica and Denise with their faces scratched out. What? Let's see. -They're deleted. Didn't you take a screenshot? -No, but I also found Jessica's room key. Why should someone send you pictures like that? Because they were killed. -Here she goes again. You really need attention, don't you? -Not at all! Why are you attacking me right now? I'm... First you're late, then you start with this shit again? I'm late because I was with the police! -We're here for Denise, ok? The police said the thing with Denise was an accident. And Jessica is still in Rovinj. -And what if she's not? What if it was meant to look like an accident? Do you think someone is running around who "Knows What You Did Last Summer"? Maybe we're all dead and this is all an illusion or whatever. What's wrong with you guys? Don't you care that we don't know where Jessy is? Of course we care. -Why are you attacking us now? I'm done with this shit. -Can we stop? Anyone want to join me at the bar? -Sure! How can you think about partying and act like nothing happened? What else are we supposed to do? Stay in our rooms and cry? Then go get drunk, if you need it. -Come on, let's not fight, ok? No, thanks. Fine. Whatever. This is Luki, hello? Yes? Really? Ok, I'll hurry. Hey, there's a space on tonight's ferry after all, so I'll be leaving now. Are you sure you want to leave? -Yes, all of this is a bit too much for me. Sure... -I have to hurry. Tell the others bye from me. Bye! -Bye, Luki Bye! Hey, your performance was so cool. We made a crown for you. Thanks! Can we take a selfie with you? -Sure. Awesome, thanks! -No problem. Hey, Carmen! Do you have fans now? Can I have a selfie with you, too? -Yes. With the Queen. Is that ok? -Sure. Show us what you've got. Don't you want to put on the crown? And show some cleavage. Yes. Beautiful. Now you'll get a kiss. Andi, come on. Another kiss. Yes, that's it! Knock it off! -Don't be like that now. First you show off your tits, now you're the good housewife? What's up with you? Do you think you're the shit now, because of that 'Queen' bullshit? Andi, come on. -You can be glad I'm touching you at all. Calm down, Andi! You're so crazy when you're drunk. -Calm down! Sleep off your hangover. Hello? Who are you? What do you want from me? Truth or dare? Dare! Finally, here we go! Anna? Let me go! I didn't do anything! Please! Please! Please, let me go! Finally, here we go! Are you ready? -Yes. I was so looking forward to this week. I wanted to have a good time with everyone before going to Munich. And now everything is so fucked up. I'm sorry I told her. I should've just told Jessica myself. Come on... ... I have an idea. Come on! Shall we go for a swim? No. No. Come on... Come on! -Bogi. Put your clothes back on, please. Julia. -I want to leave. Shit... Shit! Are you insane? -Sorry, I didn't want... Just shut up! -Julia... ... shit! Julia! Fuck... My mom has called twice already. I don't know what to tell her. I'm so sorry. If I hadn't been so drunk that night I could've helped Jessy. Then she might still be alive... Are you ok? -Yes. The police have some more questions. Is that all right? Yes, that's fine. All right, there's a lot going on right now, I'm sorry. The event is cancelled for now, and the police would like to talk to each of you, ok? Right, one of you wanted to catch the ferry today, but that won't be possible. The police have shut down the ferry service for now. But Luki left last night already. No, there was no room left yesterday. -What? We agreed that we would take him to the morning ferry. But he left yesterday. -I saw him leaving. What if something happened to Luki as well? Hi, Mom. Everything is fantastic here. It's very hot. Really hot. I've got a tan already. How are things back home? Yes, the parties are massive, there are loads of people. I've never been out with so many people. The beach is beautiful, too. The water is super clear. Other than that we're having a lot of fun. I'm getting along with everyone. No problems to speak of. It's really nice here. And... Everything's cool, but I'm looking forward to coming home. Call me back when you get this. Kisses! Hey, everything all right with you? What's wrong? -This is no longer a coincidence. I've gotten these pictures of everyone who's dead or who disappeared. The thing with Denise was definitely no accident. Do you think someone's targeting our class? No idea, but we have to leave. What's going on? -We're on a fucking island. Do you want to swim? We have to show this to the police. The police aren't taking me seriously. And the other pictures got deleted. Listen, it's super easy to retrieve old Snapchat photos. There are apps for that. Have a seat. You sure you don't have any nudes on here? -Cheesy. Look. Thanks, you're the best. I could imagine that Luki sent the picture himself. and is now having a nice time without us somewhere. Why would he do that? Well, he doesn't know that Jessica... Well, that she... I'll be right back. Make yourself at home. Luki? Fuck! Welcome to happy hour! Let me see what we have to mix this with. Here you go! Cheers. -Cheers. Don't worry. I won't do anything. I wanted to leave anyway. Hey, sorry. Come on, sit back down. No, Cheesy, I wanted to... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Sit down and... Shit, shit, shit, shit! Run! Run! Run! Run! Did you do the same to Jessy and Denise, you psycho? Did you kill them because they didn't put out? Are you ok? Julia, please! Tell them I have nothing to do with this. What have I done? That's Luki's, that's Denise's and that's Jessy's. Good news. The ferries are back in service, and the events will continue as planned. Great news... Excuse me? -Nothing. Obviously you think this is impious, but what am I supposed to do, now that the matter has been solved? "The matter"... Girl, what's up with you? I have 5000 young adults on this island! Should I just send them all home? Am I supposed to go broke because of you? I've never had a class like yours! A bunch of lunatics! Can't you guys kill each other at home? Of course we will cover the costs and arrange your trip home. No question there. Tomorrow morning you'll be on the ferry home, so you can tell your parents not to worry. That's the main thing. I'm not doing well with all of this either. So please show some understanding. We have to stick together in this, ok? Hey, wait! Where are you guys going? To my room to pack my things. And Jessy's stuff, too. Do you want to stay with us? -Would that be ok? Something doesn't seem right. What do you mean? Like what? Denise and Jessica probably didn't put out and he freaked out. Ok, maybe, but what about Luki? It doesn't fit. Fuck! What? -Cheesy couldn't have done it. I'm wondering why he decided to send you these pictures. What do you mean? -Well, Denise is still wearing braces. That was at sport camp two years ago, right? You're right. Jessy, Denise, and Luki. The pictures I got on Snapchat were all taken from this photograph. Did you guys keep in touch with Anna after she left school? No. Wait, I'll check on Facebook. That's from the Secret Party, right before Denise fell. Fuck! You're right! And what about the phones under his bed? Somebody could have planted them there. -Like who? No idea. Someone who has a key to his room. Maybe someone from the gang or the hotel. Or his roommate. Samy? Fuck, that's possible. Did you guys see his latest blog entry? Anna deleted me as friend. Check your profiles! I don't have Facebook. You are still friends. But Anna hasn't posted anything in ages. At least a few months. "You will live in our hearts forever." "So nice to have shared part of your journey. Theresia." "Infinite sadness. Thinking of Anna." Shit... "Why, dearest Anna? How could it come to this?" Did she kill herself? Yes, and I will keep you guys up to date with videos and pictures from the trip. There'll be a little surprise at the end of the week. And everything will be different. Look, there's another one. Watch! Get that thing out of my face! Shit! Fuck, maybe all of this is connected? Come on! Calm down. Maybe she died naturally. What's wrong? Anna was acting so strange after that night at sport camp. She was always a little strange. But not like that. She didn't talk at all, until she was just gone one day. What did you guys do to her? -Nothing. We played spin the bottle. Don't look at me. I wasn't even there. -And I was very drunk. What about her? No idea. I wasn't her babysitter. Guys, Samy is still friends with her. He even posted something back then. "Anna, you shall not be forgotten" Julia, it wasn't Cheesy. It's Samy! Julia, can you hear me? Where are you? I'm in my room with Lexi and Carmen. Lock the door and don't let anyone in. -We have to go! Guys! -I'll call right back. Everything all right? We're just looking for Samy. He's got something of ours. I think I saw him at the sauna party. Julia! It's me, Samy. I have to talk to you. It's about Anna. The light! I can hear you. Open the door! Julia, open the fucking door! Bogi, we should go to the sauna party and hear what Samy's got to say. I'd like to know that too. -I thought we're going to the girls? Ok, you go to the girls. We'll look for Samy. Dude! Come on, Carmen! Got it? -Yeah, I'm fine. We made it! Fuck! Damn it, Julia! Stop! You can't get in. We're full. We're just looking for a friend. He's in there somewhere. Calm down! Looking for trouble? Our friend isn't feeling well. We'll only be in there for a second. Hey, there's Leo! Leo! Cheesy is innocent, it was Samy! You have to shut down the party! Hey Julia, where's Lexi? Where did she go? It's important that you stay calm, ok? Everyone has to go back to their rooms, so we know what's going on. -I can't go back to my room. Samy can find me there. Come with me. Are you ok? -I went to your room to look for you. Samy is after us. We climbed down the balcony. Let's go to the police and tell them. -Bogi, we don't have any proof. And by the time they get here... -Guys, let's look for the others at least! Jakob and Andi are at the sauna party. Let's go find them! I'll be back as soon as I tell the police about Samy. Don't leave my room and don't open the door for anyone, ok? Look, it's Samy! "I think they are slowly starting to accept me. Jakob even smiled at me today. That night I finally felt like I was part of the group. I was pretty nervous. Truth or dare... I didn't dare to pick truth... The t-shirt smelled strange... They would've asked me who I have a crush on... I didn't even want to be there... I couldn't see, couldn't breathe... ... but Julia said 'Fuck it!' I didn't want to spoil the fun... It felt great at first... I really hoped it was Jakob... I can't look them in the eye anymore... Then he laughed... It wasn't Jakob... I wanted to leave, but they didn't let me... I could see the streetlamp through a gap in the curtains. The others didn't give a fuck about me... They didn't notice. How could I have told them? For them it was all just fun and games. I can't get his words out of my head: 'Get over it, now it's already inside!' Lexi... just wait! Where did Carmen go? -I don't know! What's she doing? Shit, Bogi... it was Lexi! Keep moving! -All that blood... Faster! Where are you guys going? -He wants to kill all of us. I heard that somebody died. Do you know who? It was Lexi. Everything was full of blood. We have to go, Leo. He'll kill everyone. Where? -No idea... just away from here. Ok, wait. I have a pickup truck. I can take you to the ferry port. This way. Come on. Come on! -We have to find the others first. Do you really want to wait for the whole class right now? Come on, please! Julia, come on! Come! Get in the front seat. Julia, come on. Julia, wait! Bogi! Fuck! I should've watched out for Lexi. What could you have done? Drink something. No, thanks. And you really don't know who's after you? Bogi found videos from Samy, and Samy wanted to get into our room. We climbed out the balcony to get away, because Samy was trying to get in. That was very strange, because Lexi, Carmen and I... What's wrong, Julia? What's going on, Leo? -It will be fine. Where are we going? Where are we going... Leo... Leo, what's going on? Go to sleep, Bogi. Lie down, come on. I'm sorry about Lexi, ok? She shouldn't have gone through my stuff. It's a pity we can't do this with the original cast. We'll just have to improvise. Tell us what you want, wanker! Truth or dare? Dare. Finally, here we go! Ok, go to the storage room, blindfolded, and someone will follow you, and you have to guess who it is. Oh, God. Are you ready? Yes. Careful. -Wow, that looks cool. Is it ok? Wait a second. Pay attention. Walk straight ahead. Have fun, Anna! Go in there! -No, come on! Fine... Are you coming, too? -Me? Of course you. -Have fun! Shut the door! Who are you? Leo Thalhammer. You're Anna's brother! -Yes, Julia. I am. Ok, you know the rules. We'll play a round. Truth or dare? Truth. Are you in love with Julia? -What? Well, are you in love with her? Just say yes or no! No. A pity. There's only one problem. You're not allowed to lie in this game. Stop it! Don't do it! Stop! Hold this until she stops moving, or I'll kill you. No! No! Fucking hell, hold it tight! -I can't. Tighten it! -No! No, no, no. Leave him alone! I thought you aren't in love with her? Shit, shit! Don't touch me! Stay there! I'm sorry for what I did. Just shut your mouth. We're far from done here. It's your turn. Julia. Truth or dare? Bogi! Say something! -Calm down, Julia. Come now. What did you do to him? It's your turn. Truth or dare? Fine... we'll finish this round of truth. Did you ever think about Anna after she left your school? What happened to her, maybe? Did you know that it was the first time in her life that she felt comfortable in a class? She would have been happy to come with you on this trip. Have an amazing time with all of you one more time, right? The best party of your life! Andi, time for a dare. Come on! Get up. How much did you drink before you raped my little sister? It was Jakob's idea! -That's not true! You started kissing her. I was just holding the camera. It's not your turn! You wanker told me to bang her. It was your fucking idea! Little wanker. -No, no, no. Come on, show us your pretty ass. No, please leave me alone. Stop it! Andi, come on. -No, I'm sorry. Just take the bottle. No! -Yes! Andi, don't do it! -Yes, do it. Come on. You saw what happened to Bogi. Get over it, now it's already inside. Now it's your turn, buddy. Come on. The bottle, come on. Put it in there. Harder! Stay in there! Very good. Dare, Julia. Now you can make up for what you did to Anna. Wait, I'll help you. I'll help you. Stop it. Let me go! Let me go! I didn't do anything to her! Stop it! -I didn't do anything to her! You guys killed my little sister! She went to our school for three months. I never even talked to her. How should I have known that... ... that they would rape her? Say it! Of course you knew what was going on. You were in the next room. Don't bullshit me! You just ignored it. You didn't give a fuck about her. What are you guys doing? Where did you guys leave Anna? -I think she's sleeping. Let's take a selfie! Come on, Anna! Quiet, or he'll wake up. Wait, something's missing... The party was more important to you guys. But now it's your dare, Julia. What? Bury these two and I'll let you go. Come on, Julia. You can do it. You can do it! What? I have to do everything myself. Can you imagine what it's like to find your own sister with her wrists slit open? I didn't get it for a long time, until I found her diary. Bogi. can you hear me? What are you doing with Bogi? Shit. -Careful, Julia. He's a psycho, too! What's going on with you and Leo? Nothing! Bullshit! He's lying, Julia! He's lying. He just asked me not to tell you about Anna's death, ok? He wanted to know things about the class. Give me your hand. I'll pull you up. We have to get Bogi out of here. Come on! Come on! I got you. Julia, please help us get out of here. Please, Julia! Get out of there yourselves, you pigs! We have to help him! Careful. X-Jam, X-Jam, X-Jam! I met some crazy dudes. I'm telling you, a night in jail changes you forever. Poor you! Can we take a selfie? Hey Bogi! -Hi guys! Careful with his shoulder. How are you feeling? -I'm fine. Are you in pain? -I'm alright. Careful with his shoulder. He's still recovering. I'm sorry. We're still looking for Luki, but... Well... Have a good trip home. -Thanks! Bye! What happened to those guys? This is going to be the biggest party ever. A week from now we'll look the same. Well, here we are. And I thought this would be my week. -Why? I was planning to come out. Sorry, but everyone knew. What? -Everyone. We've known each other long enough. That doesn't say much. You're right. Let's go, guys.
