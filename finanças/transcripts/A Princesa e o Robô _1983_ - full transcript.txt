From: Mauricio de Sousa Monica's Gang in The Princess and the Robot In the confines of the universe, were recently discovered, mysterious pulsating stars. Baptized by astronomers to pulsar, they do not shine like other stars, they pulsate as a great heart of light, beating without stopping. Legend has it that, sometimes, a ray of torn light of a distant pulsar star, can hit someone, and this someone, it will never be the same again. One, two. Left, right! Hit the pace! Let's go! You there! in queue! Fast! There's no more recruits as before. [SERGEANT] Squad! Ordinary! March!
