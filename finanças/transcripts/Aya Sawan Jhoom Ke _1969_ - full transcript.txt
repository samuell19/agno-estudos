Do not eat before you marry Rocky to your brother, daughter. - I'm hungry, Mom. - Tie Rocky and give him sweets, and then you eat. - Why is that? - Because Jayashankar is four years older than you. - Greet me. - If a monkey is older than you, would you greet him?

Or I get angry. - Now tie a rack in his hand. - I'm not doing that. - Don't be angry with your brother. - Okay, Mom. - Tie Rocky here. - Give me the money first. - Rajesh is not here yet? - Is he ashamed to say he's your brother-in-law? He did not arrive on time. - There he comes. - Welcome! You came from abroad. Why do you still carry on with old customs? A gentleman does not forget the customs of his homeland. But you must not forget that you always have to go with the times. That rule only applies to ordinary people like you... ... not to experts like me. Rajesh, he came to our family so we really prospered. Our factories grew a lot higher. Dad, my friends are waiting for me. Should I go now? - Brother, my fee? - Ah... here it is. Living is love, and rest loses everything. Except for the love of life, everything is in vain. - Saduram Sud, where are you? - Why is that? The house is full. I'm afraid people will break chairs if it's too late. The chairs were broken last Tuesday. They will break our arm today too. You're getting ready to joke, Aarti is upset there. I am also waiting for Jaidev to come. Please come in. - Who are you? - I'm fine. People are anxiously waiting. Come on, sir! Where are you taking me? My seat is on this side. Your seat is in the hearts of all song lovers, Jaidev. - My name is Jayashankar, not Jaidev. - it's OK. I will introduce them to you, she is Ina, Meena, Deeka... He's the one you've been waiting for so long. Take him to the stage, Aarti is waiting for him. Let's go sir, time is running out. - Let's go. What do you think? - Nothing. Our Chief Guest! The heartbeat of the public. Amazing! I have never seen such a perfect goal in my life. You know him and you probably know her. Thank you so much for this welcome. I have heard a lot about you Jaidev. Nice to meet you But this should not be our last meeting. I really have a great interest in music. For both girls and music... ... has rhythm, melody and charm. - Your words have a great appeal. - Only in my words? Where are you going without permission? Did you think this was a temple? No one can enter. - You may not know, I am musician Jaidev. - what? Are you going to sell something? I'm a cigar. - Is Singer a sewing machine agent? Then go to a tailor. Don't get me wrong here. Is it a mistake to come here because of your letter? Which article? - What is it? - A letter. - give me. No, thank you, I care about my throat. Where did you learn music? Rafi and Kishore are both my teachers. - Rafi and Kishore? Are you talking about background singers? No, these are people with the same name. - Are you Mr. Jaidev Kanpuri? - yes I'm... So who is he? Who are you sir I am a teacher. I want to talk. I want to talk to you. Come here! - Where are you going? - Then, I'm going. Can't go now. Because your reception was not completed. I still could not welcome you. Disciple of the classical singer Rafi and Kishore. The program starts very soon today. Please be patient until then. - Please let me go? - You can go after your singing. I can not sing Miss Aarthi. None of my families are singers. - If you ask so much, I will cry in front of them. - Do that or that. Everyone should cry in front. Mina, raise the screen. In the name of God. Do not do it. Sorry ladies and gentlemen, make a small change to the program. This person misled us by introducing us as singer Jaidev Kanpuri. Now when it is revealed he tells us he can't sing. He can only cry. Let him fulfill that desire, shall we? Then in the future he will never cheat anyone. Everyone be quiet, I'll sing again, but... - Sister, do you mind if I say something? - Yes. - You sing so beautifully, - Shall I say something now? - Yes. - It's time for you to go to school. - Then get me ready. I bathed you. Helped you get dressed. You were given breakfast. - What's left to do now? - This thing... money! He may forget to eat. But he never forgets money. Here is your money 25 paisa and series, here is your 50 paisa. I get 25 paise and she gets 50 paise. Why is that? Because you're a schoolboy. I study in a college. I am older than you. What if you are older? Dad is the eldest of them all. But I have never seen him spend alone. Dad came. Dad, very wet. I had to work in the office. Dad, I need an umbrella. Come, drink hot tea, you can catch a cold. You work so hard in the office all day. - You've become a machine. - I'm not the only one. - There are thousands of people who work like me. - Your tea. Although tired of working for their children... ... their fatigue is relieved when they meet children. - I'm tired of seeing this silver coin. - You're spinning. - You're in middle school, aren't you? - You are not wrong. - I study there too. - Maybe. Say it! - Can you beautify my car? - You mean? - May I give you a lift? - I'm not used to them. - Then can I go with you? - Yes. I'm not a cheater. Go for a walk with a decent girl in my college. Are you in my car? Or should I walk with you? ...Come on. - Not in the back. Come forward. - Why is that? I mean there is a difference, if you want... ... show me your driver, go and sit in the back. If you have no objection, can I know your name? - Why do I object? - What do you call yourself? The name is also beautiful, I am Deepak. Are you coming home for dinner? I'm waiting for you. The conference takes time. I will eat here. OK. Drive carefully. Are you here But alcohol can not give your taste. If only I had your love for the rest of my life. - Do you have any doubts? - No. no way. But sometimes I doubt my luck for sure. You may not know it, but true love can change even fate. I just love you not getting a girl like you. But there are thousands of people like me. What is our association, am I an idiot? A woman falls in love only once in her lifetime. A bud blooms all at once. It catches the eye at once. - Love only happens once. - How beautiful? I can kiss you. It is very hot. Open my zip? Such a beautiful neck empty. You know the small income of a dancer. It fills up after our wedding. I will cover you with gold from head to toe. For now, take this. - I forgot. Tell me, who am I? - Crazy, stupid, naughty. I got other names instead of my own. Why are you following me? Why bother a decent girl? If I try to come here again I will never go back alive. I'm been dead for years and now all I have to do is cremate. Let me go. Don't hit me. Stop. what the hell? I am a gentleman. Hit me politely. Cheeks, kicks, whatever you like, but hit one by one. - Stop it. Why are you hitting this? - He stole my watch. I gave it back to you, now do you need a clock tower? - Let him go. He is a decent man. We are all wrong. - I apologize for him. - Are you in business now? - And I'm at a loss. If I steal something worth 10 rupees, I have to spend 20 rupees to get it back. - Then why are you stealing? - I can't even imagine that. Not even my brother. I do not know how this habit came about. Sometimes when I lose a pocket to take, I take my own. I understand your problem. But anxiety is not the solution. - Is that a girl? - Please sit down. This "kleptomania" disappears when a girl is born. So you gave me a solution. But where do I get it? Where to get it...? There are millions, don't you get one? I meet girls every day, but how do I fall in love? When a girl passes by, your heart starts to beat. If you hear a bell ringing, you are going to fall in love. Doctor, help me. I can hear the bell ringing. - This is my wife. - Oh... Hello, my friend's wife! Wish I could hear the bell, Doctor. - My box of cigarettes... - How did it get into my pocket? Was on my desk. Dad... Hello Aunty. father... - Give me ten rupees. - Why is that? - I'm going to see a movie. I do not want you to go to the movies often. - Do you know what a movie is? - What is it? - "The Great Warrior" You too belong to a high family. Watch movies like that. Dad... money. Here, daughter. I can hear the bells ringing. My heart is pounding. - Did you tell me? - Yes. - What is it? - May I ask you something? -Yes. - I like you. what is your name? - the name...? Then I will tell you the secret. My mother is behind me. Great, I understand now. But there was never a blow like this. A bell rang. You are lucky. Your luck is better than mine. You at least ring that bell and move around. - There you go. - I'm not. That thief. He stole my wallet. - Is this it? - Yes... - But how did you get it? - I will even get your heart. You are very good. This has my ring with a gemstone. - Are you happy? - Yes. What should I do for you because I was given my wallet? - Really? - Yes. Put that gem in my heart. For an hour now I can hear the bells ringing. - Can't you hear them? - Bells? - Yes, but a little. - My name is Sadhu Ram Sood. - I'm music. Music Sood! Amazing, joy in our hearts! Come and embrace us. - My friends are coming. - When will you meet me? - Tomorrow. - Where is it? - Here. - Listen to this. Should I go now? Give me a souvenir before you go. Are you blind? - Let me go. - I will never let you go. Why do you do this to a girl? Say, who are you? - love me. - You go, Mr. I will go. But, I like your style. All the girls here love you. How are your policies? Face like a hero, popular fashion, and shape like a wrestler. Do not touch me. Don't want to touch you? I want to hug you. - You're weird. - what ever. Make me your disciple. You are the master of masters. I just want a girl. Teach me that magic spell. With that I grabbed that beautiful girl and was happy. - Make him happy. - Tell him the mantra. Why not definitely? Let's go there. You come too. Now close your eyes and listen. Eyes closed. The ears hear. A shameless man like you should drown. - He really drowned. - What are you doing now? No, it can't be. Why are you waiting? For God's sake, do something. Save him. - We'll drain his stomach. - just wait. - He's done. - Then I'm done too. Aarti, breathe into his mouth. He can regain consciousness. Why are you waiting? Hurry Up. - Hurry Up. I can heal - he's fine. A rogue man. A liar, a fraud. Master. Do not make your follower helpless. God gathered us twice and did His duty. It is not appropriate to ignore him now. - We must move forward with our goal. - What goal? Young hearts have only one purpose. I'm waiting for you at the beach this Sunday at 5pm, right '? - I'm not coming. - But I'm leaving it to him. Gave me life. He will also give me a wife. I'm sure. You all go backwards. Hurry Up. Happy Birth Day! - thank you! - You give alms to the poor on your birthday every year. May you have a long life. Where is your father - She is not well. - is it? Where are those things? Here. - Come on. - Continue, I'll be right back. Prepare the material. Get some water... - I'll take care of all this. - Now go and pray for yourself. - Where was this dish? - In the car. Brother. Take some of these flowers. - your choice. - Hurry up now. - If I hurry... - Go now. These flowers are useless now. Fell at the feet of man. You cannot sacrifice to God. But... all right. But you also deserve to be worshiped as an elder. Why are you crying mom? Why are you sad? Tell me your plight? What do you do when you hear my sad story? Forget it. Today is my birthday. Everyone eats. You come too. Today I will not be able to swallow any food. Why is that? Many years ago in a temple like this on this day... ... fate separated my son from me. I searched everywhere but did not find him. I hope to meet him before I die. Do not worry. You will find your son. - My mind tells me so. - really? Because of the years that have passed since I separated from you... ... How do you know him? Separator Addition... ... find some way to do so. Son, you gave me hope. - God give you longevity, - Eat something. No, you go. bless you. Go now Brother, feed them yourself. Help, the old lady here has fallen. How did she fall? She has a head injury. We will take her to a doctor immediately. Please come. - Whose house is this? - Come to my house. This is our manager. Says bitter words, but a beautiful heart. Sir, he has no one in this world. She has a son, who is missing. If she can stay here... Can I disobey you, sir? Not sir, son. He is our father. Bring some tea for all of us. please sit down. Sit down, imagine this is home. - How can I thank you? - Don't thank me. Bless, Aunt! - Aunt? - Yes, I will call you Auntie. I want to have your own son and hear the word mother. It's all the same. Aunt is like a mother, yes. Sit down now, come on. Aunt, are you working? What are you doing here? Not only did she distribute food, she cooked on her own. I brought you here to treat you. Not to work from you. We have a staff. Why are you worried? This is not a problem. You call me Aunt, don't you? To work with such a person is not to serve. You sit down now. Take food. Very tasty. The best meal I ever ate after my mom's death. I've been a rascal. But this is a payment of time.... ... just 5 seconds past the said time. And I still can't hear the bell. When he came I... ... I teach her a lesson that makes her cry for hours. - I think I'll have to cry my whole life now - Why? Our enemies are now making fun of us. My dad is trying to get me married to someone else. If your dad does that, I have limbs too. I have to break that stupid dad's hand. - Are you trying to harass my father? - You say so. If not, am I tempted to use bullets? - Who is he thinking of marrying you to? - To Suraj Bansi. He says he will marry me to someone of Suraj Bansi dynasty. So, "Suraj" is my grandfather's name. "Bunsey" is my father's name, it fits my generation. Go and tell Dad to prepare for the wedding. I'll come with trumpet music. Tell him, for our honeymoon... ... to arrange two air tickets with the dowry. The city of Darjeeling is more appropriate. I'll go and get the flowers. Today Fife will be playing, to welcome my dear wife. I will be your father's nephew for the rest of my life. father! Oh, my God! My darling, where did you go? Hello Doctor... - How are you? - I'm just... Your remedy healed me. I got the bell I like. - Where is she? - She was here now. Where is she - Why are you hiding here? Why are you afraid to love? - Who are you talking to? - She's embarrassed. Why is she hiding from you? We decided to get married. But a madman comes between us like a wall. He wants to marry this poor girl to a fool. He needs to be vaccinated. - The response was that our marriage should take place. - Let's do that. But first tell me the name and address of that idiot. Tell the doctor your father's name and address. - Music...? - Do you know her? she...? I know her father, mother, and that whole family. Bless us both before we meet that old man. father! Father-in-law...? We'm going home, you stay. Please Dad! I have seen it all. But, there has never been such an attack. - Salam. Am I Jazz Driver? - Driver? - Am I wrong... Your name is Aarthi. - Yes. - Ma'am, my master is very ill. - What happened to him? Dizziness, his eyes getting wet, his heart burning, his stomach hurting... Enough... I understand. Where is he I want to meet him. Do not meet him, you will never recognize him. - He got a beard overnight. - A beard...? Does a man have a beard or a child? It's no use loving the master now, that's why he sent me. I really love you. Give me a chance. It's good that the monkey did not come. Face like an ape, brain of a donkey. Young you are good compared to him. This beard goes well with your face. If you let me... -... Can I embrace it? - If you like. Aren't you ashamed to provoke a girl like this. Aarthi .. listen Aarthi. Aarti, we have been dating for over six months now. Why can't this be done by promises? Well, the shortcut you chose. What world are you in, gentlemen? To make promises... ... have to go to the girl's house several times. Meet my dad first. - Then talk to him about us. - Come there as a groom. - When will I see your father? - It's important to come when he's happy. When is your father in a good mood? He is very friendly. This week... My results will be released. If I pass... Do not be afraid, the one I love will definitely succeed. I'm going to take advantage of Dad's mood the day your results come out. What are you trying to take advantage of now? Remember I am an Indian girl. You can take advantage of this after our wedding. Daughter, you got a high pass. Congratulations, sister. My daughter! - You made my dream come true. - Dad, it's because of your blessing. But I think it's all because of your mother's blessing. If she were alive today she would be over. Now that you have completed your master's degree, prepare for the MA exam. I will never learn again. I have a job. - Doing a job...? - Yes. You work so hard for us. Now you rest, I will work. Your results came on a lucky day. I get paid today. - Want to get a gift. - You will receive the request. - Then get a nice umbrella. - Yes, Dad. - I say the same thing. - I do not need an umbrella. - I'll get you a nice watch. - What do I have? - Large clay pot. All right then. It's getting late. I'm leaving. Don't forget the umbrella, I'm not forgetting the clock, daughter. I'm so glad to meet a gentleman like you. If that is the case... Aarti and I agree. You probably know what I mean. Why don't you say anything? I know why you are silent. You will approve me. Like a daughter, so does a father. - You agree with this proposal, don't you? - Yes, I agree. - you are great. - Bless me now. - Aunt I... - I heard it all. Tell me, who is this girl? - Not about a girl, Aunt. - So? I mean... she's a goddess of wealth, a miracle of wisdom... -... She's a treasure trove - and lucky. Give me your blessing through love. - I bless you with all my heart. - I have to leave soon. Wear this coat. watch out. You will be injured. We present this umbrella to Dad. But he says, son, I do not need this umbrella. That we could have bought clothes with this money. Your reading is endless. Now Dad is coming home. Here he comes. Long live him! Why this? father. Please Dad...! How fast could he drive the car? Oh my God... why is this? Mother too suffered and died. Now seeing her children unhappy. Sister, we picked up the umbrella because Dad was soaking wet. According to eyewitnesses and investigators, it was a car accident, it is clear. The car report also proves that you are not guilty. Sign this bail warrant, sir. If you need a son in your inquiries, let me know. Probably not. But we have to go to court. - Why are you so upset, son? - I'm not worried about the case. But I remember that man. What will happen to his family? No one can prevent the inevitable, come now. I'm sorry I could not come to see your father that day. Now you can never meet him. God knows what cruel man put him in the car. I wanted to treat him. All my dreams were shattered. The shock of your father's death... ... even I will never forget it. I am for you too. If you need something or you are in trouble, let me know. Then bring that car driver here somehow. We need to kill the father who snatched us from us. My son is not guilty. To save him from danger, the son has made every effort. - It's your dad's fault. - what? Maybe he was soon. Our people do not know how to walk on the road like that. So he succumbed to it. I'm so sorry about that. I came here not just to talk to you. Cash...? Did you come to pay for Dad's life? I should have been comforted by your story. But you showed your wealth and made fun of our poverty. Take these back. If your son's reputation has been tarnished by my father's blood. Polish with this money. Get out of here now. - Are you at this time? - I'm carrying a burden on my mind. - I need to get rid of it. - What's the matter? How long have you been crying like this? Instead of applying balm to a wound, people are salting... ... what else to do but make the poor cry? - Why, what happened? - The rich son who killed my father... ... Dad came here today. - Her father? - Yes. Take back the son's fame. Wipe our tears with his money. Perhaps he thinks that the grief of death can be lessened by his treasure. I hate his ruthless son more than him. The son who never came to our house to mourn. - He must be helpless. - What helplessness do you mean? The car he killed in my dad... ... can't he come here in it? You, seeing the hatred he has... - I think he's dying of a heart attack. - Our hatred will never go away. The shock of your father's death has made you very sensitive. Try to control it. - I'll be right back. - Listen... What weight in your heart do you want to lighten up? Seeing your grief... ... so I have a burden on my mind. The court came to this decision after hearing your statement. You can be happy. Can you not hear Why not speak, O beloved hero! After seeing your situation I remembered my dream last night. Do you know what that hero looks like? From different parts of our country. I will tell you about those events. Devdas, ask me what you are doing. I will show you the way in Calcutta. - what did you say? - What are you doing here? Death awaits. Now I met someone in Gujarat. Ask me that again. - why? - What are you doing here? - Want to live. You're very naughty, sister. Now I finally met a Punjabi. Ask me that again. - Devdas... - Why? - What are you doing here? Are you my uncle to ask me that question? Very beautiful when you smile. Like the moon peeking out of the clouds. Aarti also wants this pleasure. Laugh and make them laugh too. I'm so happy today, about the marriage of the music daughter of our generation. - Have guests prepared snacks and drinks? - Yes. Now only the bridegroom is to come. What kind of person is he? I have not seen him. But he has to be handsome. Fools give a good name to a good person. - Sir, he came. - He came...? Go and come with my daughter, you take care of other things. - This is Prince Chandraraku. - We're glad you're here. Please come. Sit down sir. - Minister! Who is this man? - This is the doctor, sir. - This girl's father. - father...? What can I do with him? - I would like to talk to your daughter. - Sit down, daughter of music! - Music... - Yes, Dad? - This is my daughter. - Welcome! - Welcome! - Sit down! - Nice to see you, sir? - I'm very happy too... -... when I saw her. - Sir, he's funny. Do not count. Take these. - How many daughters do you have? - With one. - Then it won't work. - You mean? Minister, tell him about it. His father's first wife died the day after the wedding. He later married her younger sister. - If she dies that way. - It's not going to happen. According to her horoscope. - Then it's okay, - I looked for a date. - It's the 20th of this month... - That day is too far. Today, it has to happen now. This marriage will never happen. Who are you A handsome son, a talented father. - Who can bear to see these sins? - Sin? Yes, a great sin. What a beautiful girl! Would you give this cute girl to a monkey? The monkey...? Are you saying that to my girlfriend? I call you the monkey. A pedigree ape. But still royal. My son has a good generation on both sides. The father is Surajwanshi and the mother is Chandravanshi. That's why this delicate bud... ... fits our family. Leave my girlfriend. Otherwise there will be bleeding. An ocean of blood will flow here. I am also the son of a brave man... ... not an ordinary person. Stop. I know you two have warlike blood. But for God's sake do not turn my house into a battlefield. - It doesn't decide like this - So how? We need to conduct a test for courage. I want to let my daughter choose her husband. - I agree. - I agree. Two young men prepare for battle for three rounds. My daughter garlands this winner as her husband. Shut up! I will now introduce you to the two young men. The first is Prince Shatru Singh in the blue corner. The second is Prince Chandrarukhi in the Red Corner. I ask the referee to start the match now. Mr. Bimsinghe. Come on, Master. Come too. Shake hands now. Stop. I have to put a condition. I'm not responsible if he goes to heaven. I also have a condition. If this monkey loses... ... he will be born again and play with our children. But not going more than three rounds. Now, shake hands. First round! - Do you still want to marry her? - No. Father-in-law, send four men to pick him up. - Hello, Auditor General! - Auditor General...? I am Sadhu Ram Sood, Work Inspector! - Hello sir! - Well, yes... You are a very handsome man. All the workers sing praises to you. They say... ... that there was no one like you before, not even in the future. I have seen many people too. but... I know all that too. Do you want a promotion? - No, - Then go. Never come to butter me again. Go now. Sir, there is a black spot on your jacket. - Whose children are these? - Did they do something wrong, sir? They are not, you are wrong. Why don't they send me to school? - Enroll them in a school. - But sir... I'm a poor man. How are your salaries? - How much do you get paid? - Sixty rupees, sir. - He has to pay ninety rupees in the future. - Really, sir? Sixty rupees for you, thirty rupees for your children. Ten rupees for a child. There is another son. Then sir one hundred rupees please. Okay, but don't make 110 rupees next year. - What is this? - We have a festival. - If we get a holiday for it... - You come too, we're so happy. Holidays that are full of complexity are neither fun nor comfortable. I'll come too, it's going to be a really big party. - I want to see Mr. Jay. - Get in. - Sit down, I'll tell him. - Keep in mind what I said. You...? Aunty, she is... I understand, you have nothing to say about it. - If your dad saw him... - I think he's gone now. - Did you see him? - No, he was backing down. Sit down, both of you. I'll bring tea. I can not imagine how to welcome you for the first time. I want to say something. Let me touch your feet. - Why is this? - Because of the fulfillment of the desire of my soul. - Because of you, I got a job. - thank you! I want to thank you. You did this help. Our sinking boat... ... saved you. This will never be forgotten. - Thanks to my whole family. - Why is this? You cry again. Promise me. Laugh... Laugh. A smile took the form of tears. I am very happy today. I need your greetings. Start a job tomorrow and start a new life. You get my congratulations on the day you start living with me. Aunty! I have to go now. Why the emergency? Drink tea. I'll put you back. I'll go and get the key. You look at this album. It has my photos from infancy to old age. - Do you like that young man? - Should I take his childhood? It's not that good. Give it back Aarti. - Auntie, take this souvenir of mine, - That's my photo. Please give it. - No, I can't. - She didn't, did she? That's my son... my son. But this can be a mistake. My son... are you in this rich house, how is that ?. Lord... show me... I do not know what to do. - Maya...? - I want to talk about something. Why, this emergency? I could not sleep at all last night. I'm had a heart attack since last evening. Ask yourself, I have a question in my mind... This morning, what is it? Don't be angry sir. I want to know... Jay, is that your own son? - Was he born into this family? - Are you crazy? - How do you ask me that? - Punish me in any way you like. Get rid of me, kill me. But I ask you... Please answer me truthfully, you are now in the prayer room. Make God a witness and tell me that young man, Jay... ... a child born from a temple 24 years ago, right? Sir, why aren't you talking? For God's sake, free me from this uncertainty. you are right. Jay, that's a kid I met. Is he...? God, thank you so much. But why do you care about that child? I'm Jay's mother. - Mother? - Yes. Shortly after Jay was born, I became a widow. To preserve my chastity during that time... ... I killed a person. That was in an attempt to preserve my chastity. I was sentenced to many years in prison. But before that I had my baby... ... at the feet of God. So he was not branded as a murderous son. You took that child by the grace of God. This is also a blessing from God after years of searching. A mother has finally found her lost son. Now, have mercy on me and give my son back to me How to get him back? To put him off a bad name... ... you sacrificed your mother's love. What do you want now? - Is he suffering now? - Say whatever you want. But I can not stand it anymore, I'm going to die next to him. I understand your feelings. You are a good person. But people do not stop gossiping. If they find out that Jay is the son of a murderous woman... ... will society allow him to live like this? Today everyone treats him. He is known as the only son of a wealthy, well-known family. He gets marriage proposals from the richest and most prestigious families. Just think. What will be the consequences if this secret is leaked? Is your son not falling down? - Aren't people insulting him? - you are right. - I'm selfish because of my love for him. - Listen to me. Keep this secret in your heart. You leave without revealing this. What... should I go? OK. If that is your wish, I will go out in the dark of night. Aunty, you fed me too much, these clothes are stuck. The food is so delicious, I can not resist it. But from tomorrow... Light breakfast and light lunch. Look... haste is an accident. - why? - He cut his finger like a baby. I want to be a baby with all of you for the rest of my life. This reminds me of my mother. I cut my finger when I was little. Mom tore her sari and tied it the same way you did. - Get some salt, please. - This is Dad. I mean pepper. There is a meeting today - We don't have time. Eat fast. - Okay, I'm done drinking tea. Sit down. I'll look into it. Aunty, you're very quiet, really. I'm sure something is hiding from me. - Tell me, what's wrong? - Nothing. - Nothing. - How can I believe it? Today you have the same depressing look you had in the temple then. Tell me why you are crying. Yes, you go now. Call me "Mom" once. Only once. Jay! Yes, Dad? - They'm waiting for you. - Dad, Auntie's very sad today. - Maybe she remembers her son. - Make up her mind. - I didn't say anything. - If I had not intervened... If he called you "Mom" then you would tell him everything. For God's sake, please... ... you get out of here before he comes back. - Dad, do you know that Auntie is gone? - Yes. - Where is it? - She got a message that she had met her son. That's very good. But why did she not meet me? - You were asleep then. - He's coming back, right? I'm so sorry she went that way. But I'm glad he found his son. She longed to meet her son. Do you drink some tea? What a beautiful diamond ring. Even the Kohinoor will fade to your beautiful charm. I feel so embarrassed. Today's our engagement. - Stop the boat. - Why is that? Listen and stop. - What is it for? - We drink coconut. Go and get it. Bring your husband for things like this. She always gives orders. That factory is like his second wife. He often goes to meetings and is busy. OK, turn down your volume. I'll go and get them. Look, sister. Don't be something like me after marriage. So from now on, make love to your brother. Listen to this Darling! I don't really know. I can not stay away from you now. So why don't we join? We are on both sides. I will own you forever. - How is that? - I decided to divorce my wife. - My whole body hurts today. - May I have a massage? Every day you dance, the whole room is full of flowers. - Look, how beautiful! - So what? Only flowers. But this unimportant one... ... brought gifts with flowers, please accept. - your name? - You made a name for yourself. - You won the heart of our prince. - Prince...? - Yes, Prince Palamgad. - Where does he stay? You better ask him what he hopes for. He is in the group of diamond rooms in this hotel. Meet him once. It will be a great help to him. Then tell him. That I would meet him tomorrow morning. - Let's have dinner, sister. - You eat, I'm not well. Why this, you have changed in a few days. - Should I take you to a doctor? - No need. - I'm not going to the doctor. - Why not? Nothing special... Tell me the truth. Why are you silent? answer me. I played with fire. Deepak, ruined my life. I'm done. Hit me, sister, I'm wrong. It is a question of life and death not only for my sister but for all of us. - You do not cry. - Have mercy on us. I could not bear to see a poor man cry. Tell me, what can I do? You can save a young girl from a worse fate than death. Accept my sister as your niece. She was mistaken. But she comes from a good family. I am sure she will protect the dignity of your family. - If she's a girl who can not maintain her self - esteem... - Sir. Even so, I feel sorry for you. You will not be sent back disappointed. Take this money. Yes, what can money do? Go and wash your sister's sins. Is this the value of the poor man's honor? If you want more, come and get it. My door is always open for the poor. How the rich heart feels about the poor people. The son of a rich man kills a poor man under his car. His father pays him five hundred rupees to cover the crime. A rich boy orphans a poor girl. His father pays for the crime. - They all have to go to hell. - Shut up. When God decides to be silent when He sees your sins... Poor hearts always cry. What! He... can't be. Do not shout. If you do not believe, go to Hotel Plaza now. In room 302... See how it destroys your love and loyalty. You can see your girlfriend in the arms of a rich young man. - But who are you? - A resident of "Samaritan". For better or worse, I'll be there soon enough. pardon me... - I want to meet Jay. - He went out, his father is there. - who is? - A girl came to see Mr. Jay. You... Why did you come here? If this is Jay's father, did Jay kill my father? - Where did Mr. Jay go? - I put him in Diamond Plaza. Don't be ignorant. Does a thirsty person refuse water? - What's so cruel about that? - The sufferer... - How does he hurt others? - Pretty missed. Why do you say that when I've been there? - Someone came. - Probably a waiter. - who is she? - I do not know her. - Who are you and what do you want? - Nothing. Nothing. Arrived at this time. - Why are you upset? - I'm not, everything is going to go wrong. Let's go. Yes inside. After many years of merit I got you. - Never leave me. - Maybe you don't know. A decent woman only has sex with a man once. And never leave him. A bud blooms, eyes meet, only once. - Love only happens once. - Say it again. Eyes meet 100 times, love happens 100 times. I really loved you for thinking you were a decent person. But you betrayed my trust. I played with my love and money. You too are not a man but a devil. Thanks to that friend who opened my eyes before it was too late! Aren't you ashamed? Did you really believe what he said? I swear. That's all a lie. - He did it to humiliate me in front of you. - Not him, I did this. Save my sister. He is my brother-in-law. Recover yourself from this ambiguity. A woman builds a house but does not break it. You are also a witness to the sinking of my lifeboat. You...? Now get out what you want. At least listen to what I have to say. I need to explain those things. What you saw at the hotel was not real but a drama. Wealthy people are very fond of dramas. You killed Dad... ... made it look like a play too. You lied to me. Played with my emotions. That too is a joke. Are you playing any more? Listen to this! Get out of here. I do not want to see your face. Aarthi is dead. Died of the cruelty of life. God knows what else must happen in this unfortunate soul. - Let me go. - What is this? - I want to die. - Mala, why is this? - Why are you doing this? - I don't deserve to live. what happened? tell me. How can I tell you? Before the elder sister was ashamed of the society... ... I want to die. Stupid girl. Suppose you have an older brother too. No one can hurt you as long as I am alive. Let's go now. No, I'm not going there. - Sister can't face it. - Then come to our house. For me, my family name cannot be tarnished. - A down-to-earth woman can't be my son's wife. - She did not fall. She was deceived. Ask your conscience and answer me. If this was your daughter, if this tragedy happened to you... ... if you have to kneel and beg to protect your family's honor... ... What are you doing? You're talking emotionally, young man. If I do not marry my son to a suitable person... ... where do I get a lot of dowry money? Deepak is the son of a wealthy steel merchant. He was not a steel merchant but a son merchant. - Shut up and get out of here. - Okay, I'll go. But if you miss this opportunity, your whole life will be ruined. Do not miss your chance. Make your son, a groom and a good man. - What did you decide? - It's already told you. So now listen to what I decided. All the newspapers in town tomorrow morning... ... and wall posters Your story and your son's story... ... will be indicated in bold black letters. The control of the steel factory that turned your heart into steel... ... and factory keys will get into these hands. Does that mean you are the son of Jugalkishore? Yes, with all your business... ... this beautiful bungalow is mortgaged. I'm sorry I had to say things I shouldn't have said. God bless you guys! God will protect you both. Congratulations, congratulations on your marriage life! Go and get blessings from your sister. Listen... Do not tell Aarti anything about me. I am preparing a party to celebrate this joy. - You should all come. - Indeed. - Don't forget. - Absolutely. Sister, God bless you! I'm so happy... I'm so happy, Mala. May God always keep you happy! - My troubles are over today. - I'm sorry I hurt you. But you took away all our troubles and brought us joy. Forget the stupidity I did in this happy moment. I also apologize. You are like a father to me. I will never forget what he did. It was as if a stranded boat had been brought ashore. We can't take credit for that. Tell your sister about the party. Yes, a friend is planning a party for us tomorrow. - You should come, sister. - I'll definitely come. Won't you ask me to come? You did not even introduce me to him. I will do that. I am your brother-in-law. Sister, is he a legal eagle? - Come on sister! - Where did you bring me with this? - To a party. - why? Mala, congratulations on your wedding! Come on in, everyone is waiting for you. - Yes, Dad? - Your sister, her husband did not come. Look at that. Mala, I feel like I'm out of breath here. I want to go home. Bio, try to understand. - You do not understand. - You blame him for Dad's death. But he is not the enemy of the father. Okay, let's just say Dad's death was imminent. But how can I forget what I saw? He is not unjust. He is a very good man. What you saw may not be true. He came to see you but you did not listen to him. - Don't remind me of that. - To me, he told me not to... ... there is something. But I have to say that. Sister... I tried to commit suicide. But Jay saved me. I became a bride because of him. - Is it all because of him? - Yes. That is the truth... Congratulations, Mala! Why are you so sad? Come on. Come on! You're angry, aren't you? Okay, I do not need to say, I know all that. I think you are dreaming about your wedding. Do not worry. Still quiet, right? But your turn also comes. Brother...! I don't think she's right. Sing a song and make up her mind. If my song can make up her mind... ... I'll be singing my whole life. Then this party will become her life. Then go... Ladies and gentlemen! To please your heart... ... my brother will now be singing a moving song. Sister... are you still angry with Jay? Go and meet him. Talk to him. All problems will disappear. Is that what you think? Go, sister. please. pardon me! I came to this party with a complaint instead of a greeting. - Who are you? - A discarded woman A helpless woman who came here to seek justice. This is a party, not a court. Who allowed you to enter here? Do you know who she is? Ask me who I am. The one who promised me marriage and played with my feelings. Now I miss him because he is the mother of his child. Don't talk to her, Dad she's lying. Are you and I lying? God knows that. There are people here who know about it. People who have seen you talk beautiful stories with me. Well, ma'am... am I lying? Didn't you see he was with me at the Plaza Hotel? You still say you know nothing. I met you at the Plaza Hotel. - But it's all a sham. - This baby has your blood. Is that a lie? Is this blank check that you signed a lie? Are these jewelry you gave me a lie? Jay! What is this doing? Check, this jewelry, this baby... Jay why this? I am... What can I say and how can I say it? Trust me, I'm innocent. I have done nothing wrong. Shut up! Everything proves your fault. I never dreamed. That you will become such a lowly person. Are you not sure about your own blood? It's my luck, it's... You are not my blood. - Dad... - You, don't call me Dad. The boy who was brought from the temple. Me and my late wife. The one who raised us as an heir to our property... ... that one day we will have a scar. That he would insult us at a party. Go out... go. Get out! My head is shaking with shame. Can't stay here from today. Awesome! Congratulations on your acting ability. - Here's the charge. - Do not embarrass me. I don't think we're two. But you do not trust me. So you got me to sign those documents. They were at that time. I do not use them now. - Now all I want is your love. - Really? - Then give it back. - return...? Are you scared? No, not really. I tore them up. Awesome! Will you lie to me too? Do not try to do that. Give me that. or... What are you doing here? Let me go. I was just kidding. I made a joke too. Hurry up and get them now. Talk now. Do you need those documents or your life? - What the hell are you doing? - Don't come forward. Fraudster! The hand that saved me money... ... tried to squeeze my neck. You wanted to show me this and run away. If I want I can kill you with this revolver. If you want to live, give me those documents. Where... give! Rita, you can not escape this way wherever you are. Come out now. What did you do here? Why did you kill this girl? My sister's life was miserable. Tell me why you did all this? Go. For God's sake, go. Don't bother my sister anymore. Support the father as a son in his old age. Go now. Go. - Someone is coming to see you. - See me...? Must be Aarti. But I... - How do I face her now? - Come on. Aunty! Handcuffed, what happened? I'm so glad you came to see me. But... none of my loved ones came. Don't cry Auntie, I can't even wipe your tears. I heard you found your son. How is he? What can I say? He has made me cry a lot. When he was a baby... ... I put him at the feet of God and spent years in prison. When we finally meet him, for his own good... ... I had to suppress my emotions. Then I walked away from him crying because of my misfortune. And today that son is handcuffed in front of me. And make me cry again mom. Mother... I have been longing for my whole life to hear you say this. But today I cry when I hear what you say. Did you really kill that girl? Mother... Why did the story stop? answer me. My mind tells me that my son will never do such a thing. Tell her you didn't kill her. You can never do that. How can I say that, Mom? How can I say that? Whatever I do is wrong, right? I ask you, why did you do that... why? You can't hit him. This is a police station. Not your home. Do not stop her. For the first time in her life... ... a mother loves her son. I bothered you so much Mom, I'm sorry. - Suppose the son is dead. - No, don't say that. Your time is up. - Constable, take him inside. - Don't take him. God knows why these obstacles. They often recur between mother and son. - Where are you going? - I want to meet the gentleman. He went out. - That's very important. - Stay aside, the car is coming. Sir, save my life for God's sake. I do not want to hear that. Get away. Would you like us to help a murderer and ruin our reputation? - Jay killed someone. He should be punished. - No. Do not say that he is always a brother to you. She had been dating 'Rocky' for years. Save your brother now. It is a tragedy that I have been tied to such a man for years. Now I'm ashamed to call him brother. Disgusting to see him now. - What are you doing here? - It's not worth keeping them here now. Throw it out. "Don't hurt my sister anymore. Be like a son to a father now." Is that what you think? Rajesh I came here frustrated from all sides. I beg you to save my life. I'll go a long way with him. Because this, did not see in the newspaper today? Take this. Read about his actions. What should I read? I know everything. Then why did you keep the photo of that murderer here? - He's not a murderer. - You mean? Is my son innocent, is he really like that? Yes, if he was guilty of something... ... because he is an ideal brother and a very great man. Father, son did not understand. The sister also refused to accept him. He was insulted but... ... he risked his life for his sister's happiness. Mother... Who created such a gem? You must be my mother too. You should be proud... - He's your brother. - Then how did all this happen? - Who killed that girl? - I was killed. - No. Yes, I killed her. - This hand shot her. - That's a lie. - No. That is the truth. I'm the cause of Jay's trouble and helplessness. I betrayed you. Your father betrayed his trust in me. - I tricked myself too - Where are you going? Where I should go first. Why release me, who pleaded guilty? - I am! - What did you do? - I did my duty. - Your duty now is to treat Dad. Take care of your wife. Sir, he loves me so much. That is why he blames himself. You do not know how valuable your life is. I am a marginalized man. I know you are a godly person in life. But I have a chance to be a man and you want to snatch it up? My statement is absolutely true. - No, sir. He is lying. - The statement can be true or false. Okay, your love is unquestionable. No doubt here too. Neither you nor he killed her. According to the investigation report, the bullet that killed the girl had come out... ... not from this gun but the police have no clue right now. Who killed her? My wife's second boyfriend is also here. I'm already sent her to hell I'll send you both there to tell me, who was the first? tell me. Who are you I am the husband of that girl. She was a faithful wife... - A faithful wife...? - Yes. From top to bottom... ... Money was her husband and she loved it to the end. A faithful wife. - Mother! - My son! I feel that you have shed countless tears for me. Why am I sad? Now I got you. - My life is successful now - Mom My life... ... will be complete by serving you, I have no one else in this world. Let's go a long way from here. Let's build us a small house. I'll do a job, you rest, everything will be fine. do not Cry. Why are you crying, Silly? You should be happy. God has given your husband back. Be happy and at peace. Forgive his guilt. Brother I... Won't you forgive my sister? - Jay I... - Aarthi... You still have a place in my heart. It always exists. Why are you crying now sir? All is well. Those who have gone astray are on the right path again, those who are separated are united. Let me go now. I'll take my mother and get out of here. This means that you have not yet forgiven me. That day I insulted you in front of everyone. Today, I beg you all. - What are you doing here? - Son, I beg you... ... and from this wonderful woman... Not to snatch away my rights that have existed for years. - Tell Jay, my "son"... - Don't talk like that. I gave birth to him and left him. But you exalted him and made him a man. Jay, your son. - father! - My son! This is a popular Hindi movie released in 1969. Sinhala Subtitle Editing: - Vithanage Priyantha Dayakeerthi.
