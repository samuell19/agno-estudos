You Tube - Video Running Time 02:31:15 You Tube search name - Paying Guest (1957) | Dev Anand I Nutan (Full Movie with Subtitles) Captions Provided by Cinephile Media I return from your doorstep after being insulted. You were kicked out, weren't you? Don't crack jokes. I'm in a bad mood. - What's the matter, advocate? - I had to pay the rent for six months. And the landlord got a wrestler to bother me. And you were kicked out? I want to commit suicide, Jagat. Don't try to stop me. I won't stop you. Because I don't have any money to lend you. - You can at least give me alms. - Sure. I've 2 annas. Fake ones. Take it. I wouldn't have a dime to buy poison, had you not been here. - See you, friend. - See you. - Listen... - Yes? Do keep on offering flowers on my grave. Don't worry, advocate. The family members of all the... accused whom you have put behind the bars will offer flowers... and lit candles, too, on your grave. You swine! Listen, Jagat. I'm going in search of a house. This are my belonging. If I happen to find shelter... I'll ring you. You can bring my belongings there. Bye. - You look to be from a decent family. - Yes. But still I would like a reference from your old landlord. - Reference? - He'll give me your character certificate. Character certificate? Don't you know what a certificate is? I see. For that I'll have to travel a long way - Why? - He was hale and hearty. Just a single sneeze and he died that very moment. - His name was Totaram. - My God! You must have a certificate from the previous landlord. - I went to get it. - Then what happened? That Moslem guy was praying. He bowed down and never rose back up. Poor guy, he died while praying. Goodness! Are you an advocate or an angel of death? For heaven's sake go away. I don't wish to die. - By God's grace I've four wives. - Good God, you've four wives? God knows when you'll land in trouble. I'm an advocate. I'll be useful to you and your children. There's a point in what you say. Alright, I'll let you stay. - Thank you. - Jumman Khan. - Coming, master. - Show the advocate the room. - The one below Mr. Digambar's. - Thank you, Mr. Nawab. Listen, the room above yours belongs to Mr. Digambar Nath. He shouldn't face any inconvenience. Not at all. I'm quite a loving person. That's the trouble. Mr. Digambar hates lovers. You don't understand. I'm a peace loving man. What are you saying? The one before you also liked Shanti (peace). Mr. Digambar smashed his head. Don't you dare look at Shanti. - Not at all. - Understand now? - Thank you, Mr. Nawab. - What's this? Jumman, show me the room. For example... For example... Take this impudent girl. She must surely be a dark, ugly, fat girl dancing over my head. Just wait. I'll return after completing the legal formalities. - Rascal! Rogue! Swine! - What? None of them are here. Someone must've misguided you. Go ahead. Hey mister, decent people stay here. The consequences won't be good if you act tough. Got it? What will you do? - You'll be kicked out. - Who would do that? - I. - Good Lord! Go ahead, push me. I'll recite a new sonnet about this situation. - Impudent fellow! - Sister, take this stick. Great! The whole family is here to attack. Brooms, sticks, they have everything. Anyway, forget all this Ms. Shanti. I'm Ramesh Kumar, B.A. LLB. An advocate. Please be seated. No thanks. I'm here to ask you the reason for this mischief. This bamboo! Ms. Shanti, while you were dancing upstairs... the dust was streaming down. I tried to see if the ceiling... was strong enough and... She gets angry over love, and I love when she gets angry. What are you doing? You'll be charged under section 313. You will be imprisoned for six months. I don't care. I'll teach you a lesson... Hey, wait! What's happening? What's the matter? Father, God knows from where the Nawab has got this ruffian here. I was dancing upstairs and he thrust the bamboo underneath. He talked rubbish when I came to ask him. - Mister, what's all this? - Greetings! You look tired. Please be seated. No thanks. I'm fine. What indecency is this? You can see for yourself. Why ask me? I see. You commit an offense and threaten me too! No sir. I've only committed an offense. - You are a tough ruffian! - No. I'm a very tough lawyer. My success is the talk of the town. - Here's an example of that. - Yes. Dear, let this bamboo remain here. I'll call the police. - I'll see that he's behind bars. - Don't trouble yourself. - The police won't do anything. - Why not? - What will you tell the police? - That you thrust the bamboo... - from the ceiling of your room. - I'll tell them that you... - pushed it from your room above. - My God! I did? What a lie! - I'll say that. You've no proof. - Really? You ruffian, swine... Father, don't get angry. You might have a high B.P. Let's go. No use talking to this ruffian. I'll deal with him. - That would be good. - Shut up! But Mr. Digambar what's the matter? He's a decent man. Decent? Just remember, Mr. Nawab, as long as that rogue stays there... - no decent man can come here. - Why do you leave the place? - I'll kick him out. - No thanks. I've arranged to stay elsewhere. Here are your keys. I'll leave. - Jumman Khan... - Yes, master? Saw what that advocate did? He compelled... my tenant to leave. He's been here for 20 years. Just go and see. Thank you, my lord. My friend, Mr. Dayal, says that... my client, Prem Kumar, abducted Sukhdevi. This is baseless. Jury, just have a look at Prem Kumar. Can a person be a criminal who has such an innocent face? Never. Sukhdevi went with Prem Kumar of her own free will. The defense lawyer is forgetting that Sukhdevi is a minor. The reports from the doctors prove that. And taking a minor without the consent of her parents... is a dangerous offense. Does the defense lawyer wish to say anything? The question of minor and major is worth considering. - Take for example... - What do you wish to say? Just this, that at a certain age when the girls... of our country mature, the girls of other countries... are still quite iimmature. The court should think before deciding... the law is not the same in all countries. If the law is the same, the lovers of many countries... would be ruined. People will stop falling in love. I don't wish to say anything. The decision lies in your hands. If you wish, you can destroy the love. Come on, shake hands! We've won the case. - But it is yet to be decided. - You and your lover will unite. Can't you see. The judge smiles. After hearing the defense lawyer and the public prosecutor the... court decides that Sukhdevi should be handed to her parents. And Prem Kumar, alias Ram Kumar, should be imprisoned... rigorously for 2 years for kidnapping her. You said I'd be united with my lover. God knows where these advocates come from! You tried your best. But the case was complicated. It is my destiny. I get a complicated case. A rude landlord, and a girl I came across was rude, too. You're quite interesting. Okay, Mr... Excuse me, I can't rent my house to any of you. - Why? - You're bothering me now. I can't rent my house to any of you. - We'll pay you the full amount. - So what? I've decided... I'll rent my house only to an old man. Not to youngsters. You may all leave. - Accept my greetings. - Who are you? I am Vajahat Mirza. I am a resident of this city. My destiny and situations forced me to go a foreign land. And what do I see when I return? The whole city has changed. Neither do I find any friends, nor a house where I can stay. My friend gave me your address. I've come here to test my destiny. - Please help me. - No problem. Come inside. Thank you. - Be seated, Mr. Mirza. - Thanks. - Will you have some cardamons? - What? - Cardamons? - No thanks. He is Mr. Mirza. He needs a house to rent. - She is my daughter, Shanti. - Greetings. May you live long! - What do you think, dear? - I think he's the right choice. Great! I thought she might say that. May you live long! To tell you the truth, we needed an elderly person like you. - Very good. Great! - But you should stay as... - a paying guest with us. - Paying guest? What is that? It means the room and furniture will be ours. - And you'll have breakfast and meals with us. - Marvelous! What else do I need? In fact I was in search of people like you. - The rent would be Rs 100 p.m. - Only that much? - This is nothing. - So do you agree? Agree? You are strange! Mr. Digambar, have some cardamons. My belongings are in the tonga. I'll get them. Don't worry. Put his belongings in the room and listen. Now you have to look after that room. Watching your hospitality, I feel that... I have come to my wife's place. - You are quite humorous. - You haven't seen anything yet. - You are strange. - Want cardamons? I'm happy that you've chosen the stage setting as that of... a court for the annual college debate. Where two lawyers argue while standing before each other. And your topic is, what is needed for a successful marriage. Wealth or love? The participants can proceed with the debate. Friends and respected principal, marriage is the biggest... problem of the life. And every problem is solved by the mind. The mind knows that happiness lies in wealth. Wealth is prestige. Wealth is power. Wealth is faith. Wealth is God. And if the mind is right, one doesn't need love... but needs wealth to marry. Friends and respected principal, a lover has said... When in love one finds everything beautiful Life is worthless, if there's no love I would like to question my friend. Is it right to compare the lovely relationship of... marriage with wealth? Marriage means two people stay together for a lifetime. The unison of two souls. It's not a business... to think of profit or loss. So you want to say lovers don't need wealth? No, just this thing... Love doesn't desires wealth. It's an exchange of two hearts. And not a business. Great! It means I have a chance. Shanti forgets, an empty stomach can't make love or recite a sonnet. I'll say that it's better to marry an old wealthy person... in order to make the marriage a success, rather than an idle... young man who can only dream, but not satisfy hunger. The youth is ruined when one enters into a relationship... with an old man. All the comforts prick like thorns. I feel, for love one can live an entire life in poverty. But one can hardly live after losing one's love by substituting wealth. The love that my friend is so proud of is sheer madness. - Useless people do such things. - If it's true... then why did Savitri forsake wealth? Why did Sita go into exile? Why did Padmini plunge into fire? Why did Meera consume poison? There must be happiness in it. Else the lovers wouldn't say lying on their death bed... Oh vulture, eat away my body. You can have all the flesh. Just spare my eyes. For I hope to see my beloved. Meera has also said, had I known, love would give... me so much grief, I would tell everyone not to fall in love. My friend has forgotten the demands of the present time. The biggest question of life is not love... but wealth, bread and clothing. A poet has truly said, when coins clink in one's pocket. When one's stomach is full. Even a stone appears as a diamond. And dew-drops appear like pearls. What do I say to you all? Love is the greatest wealth. The woes of a lover's heart are diamonds. And the tears are the pearls. When we came back to our senses... we forgot all about love. We think only of satisfying our hunger. We've forgotten what love is. We are in love. We've forgotten the world. Now don't talk about being in our senses. We are already out of our senses. Great! I'll announce the judges's decision about the competition. The first prize goes to... Ms. Shanti. The second prize goes to... Ms. Chanchal. I'm sorry, you finished second. Personally, I feel that your... - thinking is correct. - If you think that... I'll think I've finished first. - What are you watching, Chanchal? - He's so rich... and yet he's unmarried. That girl would be so lucky... - who marries him. - He's as old as your father. - So what? - You're so fond of wealth... - that you don't consider his age? - Foolish girls think of age. - You'll repent some day. - Think about yourself. If you're so fond of true love, then go on, marry a beggar. - Don't preach to anyone. - I don't care. Go on, marry a dying old man. Bravo! One from me too! A hard one! - Hey! Get down. - Wait. It's quite fun. - I say, get down. - Constable... - Constable, how are you? - I'm fine. Let's go. - Where? - Police station. - Why? - You'll know soon enough. But constable, someone was murdered inside. - She's dead. Climb up and see. - Really? Hurry up. The situation is quite delicate. Greetings! What a match it was! You were great! - I've no words to praise you. - I don't want to hear. Get lost! - Where? - Wherever you wish. I'm going to the same place you are. Come, I'll drop you. What are you doing? Your feet will ache. - It's quite far off. - Goodness! Stop following me. Alright. Go on. I know you didn't call me... but is my company so intolerable? I just came along but you ignore me God, you're something else! I like to serve the beauties I welcome the beauties Don't get angry. Forget it Here I am in your service Whatever state my heart is in It now belongs to you Look here, give me a glance Don't you play with my heart God be praised, you agreed with me And my world is alright again I made you laugh, taught you to love Won't you at least say 'thank you'? I know you didn't call me... but is my company so intolerable? I just came along but you ignore me God, you're something else! You are incomparable. - When will we meet again? - Father! - Father, come now! - He harassed me all the way. I just gave her a lift. Now... My respects! - At last Shanti has trapped you. - Jagat, don't speak of her that way. I want to marry her. - Marry? - It's no joke. I'm serious. Really? This is some news! When you go to give milk to Mr. Mirza, ask about the rent. I've to send money to your sister. If the money doesn't... reach on time, her drunkard husband will come here. I need the rent tomorrow. Good! Girl, tell your father not to worry about the rent. I'll get the money from the bank tomorrow and pay him. - Thank you. - Girl, you're leaving? Sit awhile. What's the hurry? Today I was about to beat a ruffian. - Who was he? What did he want? - I don't know. He met me on the way and followed me to the house. - He must be a true lover. - What are you saying? - I hate the sight of him. - Hatred! Girl, hatred is... - the first sign of love. - Must be. I only wish... he'd stop following me. Can't you do anything? Why not? Call me whenever he comes. I'll teach him a lesson he'll remember all his life. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'll leave. - Okay. - Thief! - Not a thief! It's me. - Why have you come? Go away. - You get angry for no reason. I've come a long way. I just wish to talk to you. I don't wish to talk to you. You should leave. I'm sorry to say, you're so beautiful yet so ill mannered. Just think... Just... just think of how strange this meeting is. The solitude of the night, this loneliness... and a stranger comes to meet a beautiful girl. - Will you leave or not? - Like the hero and heroine of a love story. Facing each other. Their hearts beat. Desires are restless. But the lips are sealed. Eyes meet each other. But the secrets aren't revealed. - Please go away. - First give me a smile - No. - Give me a smile. Come on. - No. - Then, I won't go. - You won't? - I'll not go. - Fine. - Alright. Oh God! Who is it now? Mr. Mirza... Mr. Mirza, open the door. I can't even sleep properly in this house. Mr. Mirza... - Girl, what is it? - He's here again. - Who? - That ruffian. We left the... old house due to him. I can't disturb father. He suffers an attack when he gets angry. Don't worry. I can deal with him all alone - Take me. - Come on. Girl, wait here. I'll make a mincemeat of him. Stupid! Rascal! Why the hell have you come here? I've come to meet Ms. Shanti. I love her. Love? She doesn't love you. Why are you forcing her? This is the question of my life. If she refuses, I'll die. You're going to die anyway. Get out! Get lost! Else I'll break your head. Get lost! You devil! - No, never! - Never, really? You won't go? You'll lie in a pool of blood. - You'll do it again? - Just you wait Mirza! Now I'll not consider your old age. My God! - Mr. Mirza? - You pushed me? Rascal! I'll skin you alive. I'm no less. Girl, just wait here. Kill me. Skin me alive! I won't stop loving her. I'll lay down my life for Ms. Shanti. You're still alive? I'll teach you a lesson! Oh God! This Mirza has killed me! Mr. Mirza, that's enough. - Mr. Mirza? - Lord is the ultimate truth! - What are you saying? - In our community when... anyone dies, we recite this psalm. - You killed him? - He's not dead yet. But one day by the grace of Lord, he will die. - But where is he? - I pushed him from the window. Goodness! - Dear, you're crying? - I didn't tell you to beat him so badly. He didn't sin. He just loved me. You're a butcher! Girl, are you angry with me? No, Mr. Mirza. Forgive me. I was rude to you last night. No problem. I regret that I did such a thing yesterday. - Poor chap! He's serious. - Did you meet him? - Yes. - Where is he? He's at the art gallery on the corner of the road. I think he has no one. Who will perform his death rites? - Old man, can't you see? - As if you are quite young? Forgive me, madam. Today I won't sell any artworks. My friend is dying. How can I do business? Never! I've not come to buy anything. I've come to meet with him. - What's your name? - Shanti. So you're the one who had my friend beaten by Mirza. - What do you want now? - Don't get angry. - I'm here to seek forgiveness. - Whom will you ask to forgive? He's been unconscious since yesterday. Let me at least see him. Please? This way. Seen it? Now are you satisfied? No use crying. If you really care for him... sit beside him and serve him. He's all alone. Sit besides him. I'll get the doctor. Alright. I'll sit here. Where am I? You're at the art gallery. - Who are you? - I'm Shanti. Shanti? Why can't I see you? - Oh God! Why can't I see? - Please lie down. - You aren't well. - I want to see my Shanti. - I want to meet my Shanti. - Mr. Ramesh, she is with you. - Then why are you worried? - With me? Shanti is with me? Oh Lord! What do I hear? Did you answer my prayers? I don't believe it. Shanti, come close to me. - He has revived! - Now I'll fall unconscious. I'll leave. I'll return. Rascal! Wait! I'll beat you to pulp. Father! Father fell unconscious. - How are you father? - Quite fine. I feel as though I was in a deep slumber. - Indeed! Two days and two nights. - Two days and nights? Yes. You kept on sleeping and my medicines cured you. And your son served you day and night. - My son? - Yes. What's his name? - Mr. Ramesh. - Is that rascal still here? He's not my son. He's a dangerous man! If not for him you wouldn't have been saved, Mr. Digambar. He might not be your son but the way he has served you... even your own son wouldn't do it. - Yes, father. - Mr. Ramesh gave this letter. Dear, read it aloud. Mr. Digambar, I regret for what I have done. I did it out of my helplessness. If only I could tell you how helpless I am. But now it's not necessary. I'm leaving your house. Forgive my innocence. Your slave, Ramesh. Rascal! He wants to run away without paying my rent? Go on child, bring him here. Until he pays the rent... he can't vacate this house. Go on dear. He mustn't have gone far off. Bring him back. Where is Ramesh? My dear friend Jagat, when you receive this letter... I will have drowned myself. My life is a burden. I can't live like this any more. I'm going to embrace death. I'll drown myself in the lake near Shanti's house. Seek forgiveness from Shanti on my behalf. Your friend, Ramesh. You sit here relaxed. You didn't even go to see him. What's the use? He must have already died. - What did you ask God? - You tell me first. I seek your love. - That's all. - Now that I have you... I have everything. I seek nothing more from Him. I know it's quite difficult to have you as my wife. But it's a human tendency. He tries to possess the thing... which is out of his reach. It's difficult to have God. But still a human sacrifices everything in order to have Him. Will God listen to my prayers? Close your eyes and think of Him. You'll find the answer. Release my shawl. What will the world say? The world, too, is crazy over these gestures What will this crazy world say? I'm leaving. Continue with your love-story There's mischief in the air. And you're crazy, too Beloved, listen to me Just think, how will this pleasant atmosphere feel? Don't stare. Passionate desires may flood my mind I fear, you might hurt me and leave me lonely These are the days to enjoy I'm not in my senses. Who cares what others say? The spring, the drizzling rain and these showers I'm shivering all over. Hold my hand, beloved Come, dwell in my heart We are one now. Who cares what the world says? Release my shawl. What will the world say? The world, too, is crazy over these gestures What will this crazy world say? - What will the world say? - What will this crazy world say? That son-of-a-gun, Ramesh hasn't returned yet? What, son-of-a-gun! Father, he's still a bachelor! I know. I mean, Ramesh. What is he practicing? He leaves before I wake up and returns after I sleep. Dear, I'll go and sleep. Here are his room keys. If he pays his rent, let him in. Otherwise kick him out. Got it? Alright. Let him come. You? I thought it was your father. Put out the lights or your father will beat me. - What is it? - The rent? How unromantic are you? This is father's money. Pay the rent. The house expenses? Father returns this money to me. I handle the expenses. Great, Shanti! This idea can work every month. - What are you writing? - My dear, I've penned a song... on your exotic beauty. You'll be stunned when you hear it. - Want to hear it? - Alright. It goes like this. Your dark tresses... Nonsense! Where's the rent? Yes, rent! Hey mister, how did you enter? How did you? Actually, your rent. Good that you came. Very good! I was worried about you. - Right, dear? - Yes. You were worried. Give him something to eat. I'll send this to your sister. Father, are you sending a money-order to sister? Yes. Her husband has wired me. If he doesn't get the money... he'll send her here. You know, I hate that drunkard. I'll send it over. You might forget. Alright. Send it today. If you send the money, what about the household expenses? I can hold the money order for a couple of days. But you'll have to arrange money for those days. - Saw this? - What? Barrister Dayal and your friend Chanchal got married. - What! It's impossible. - See this. When and how did this happen? I don't believe this. - This news is false. - Is it? Look there. Darling, you don't know how happy I am today. My friends will be envious reading this news. Everyone will only talk about us. I'll go crazy. I'm happy to know you're so happy marrying me. - I never thought... - That I would love you? I'll change your life. I will prove it... How will you prove it? The public prosecutor says Mrs. Lal is the murderer. But I'll prove that woman is innocent. Sir, this is your house, not your court. And don't forget I'm your wife. Chanchal, there's a complicated case going on in the court. And I keep thinking about it. You were talking about shopping. I've deposited 50,000 in your account. I can't come with you. Go along with the manager and buy whatever you wish. I should leave for court. I... 50,000! I'll can buy anything. Madam, where are you going all dressed up? I want to make Shanti jealous. I want to show her what I possess. Wealth, respect, all the comforts of this world. This night is so beautiful. - It has become beautiful. - How? You smiled, hid your face, and the night became beautiful. Who taught you all this? Shanti taught me. - Welcome. - Excuse me. I came upstairs without telling you. I thought you'd be alone. No problem. Ramesh, she is... I know him. - He's not that ugly. - I've a good heart, too. - That I must test. - Someone has already seen it. Really? Then what are you waiting for? The musicians aren't available. You look happy. Tell me, what have you got? - Didn't you see? - No. Not your fault. No one can see this wealth. - Then it must be an illusion. - You're right. Those who search for wealth find every joy an illusion... every smile a deception and every laughter a sham. And those who don't have wealth suffer their entire life. Happiness turns into grief. Laughter turns into pleas. Those people are misled. Ask them to come here and see. People here smile even in extreme poverty. Right, Shanti? - Let's see for how long? - Till the last breath. - Your love is so strong. Right, Shanti? What are you discussing? Forget about it. - How is life after marriage? - Can't you tell. - Of course we can see your riches. - Ramesh! Why didn't you bring Mr. Dayal along? I forgot. Mr. Dayal must be waiting for me. Mischievous fellow. Why did you insult her? - What will she think? - She must be jealous. Mr. Dayal has had it today. Keep on working! If you always work, why did you marry me? I'm preparing a case. It's a question of one's life. You worry about the world. Don't you worry about me? - What's wrong with you? - You ask me that? It's a month since we married. You spend the whole day in court. The days with the judge and the nights with these files. If you had to live this way why did you marry me? Why I married you? Don't look in the books. I'll answer you. The way you got things to decorate your home... for the same reason you acquired me. You don't need a wife but a doll, a show piece. I know I can't spare time due to my busy schedule. But that doesn't mean I don't care about you. You might be caring for me in your dreams. I'll surely try to spend some time with you too. What's this? Such a beautiful moonlit night. Had lovers not been in this world... God wouldn't have created this beautiful night. Let's go to the terrace. Go ahead. I'll get the cigarettes. Oh, the one with beautiful eyes... look how pleasant the atmosphere is You've wounded my heart. Now have some mercy on me Watching these intoxicating eyes... why wouldn't anyone go crazy? The fire burns and passes the signals What will the fire-fly do? Don't save yourself from me Come into my arms lovingly Even the moon and stars are envious... listening to our love-story Let the lights be turned off Don't stop swaying Let passionate desires flood your mind It's the time for love Oh the one with beautiful eyes... look how pleasant the atmosphere is You've wounded my heart. Now have some mercy on me - Sister? How are you? - Fine. We haven't met in a long time. Brother-in-law, what did you get for me? Why are you looking? I emptied the bottle on the way. Good that you're here. Now I'm satisfied, I saw you. - Don't talk like that. - Greetings, father. What's the matter? My enemy seems to be unwell. - I mean, how are you? - The same old ailment. Then there's no danger. This ailment is routine. - Shanti, did you call the doctor? - Yes. - Gave the medicine? - Yes. There's a tonga standing outside. Pay him. Dear, freshen up and eat something. You must be hungry. Instead I'm thirsty. My whole body aches. - Uma, let father rest. - Go on. Father, look after yourself. We've no one besides you. That's what worries me. Remove my shoes. The atmosphere of your house appears ominous. You're sick. Your father, too, is unwell. You've turned the house into a hospital. Arrange for some whisky. My mind will be freshened. Father is unwell and you say such things? Goodness! You're such a fool. My dear wife... I want to drink to his health. The motive behind this is... as soon as I gulp down a couple of pegs, your father will get up... and start doing work outs like a wrestler. - Don't say such nonsense. - Your father doesn't drink. Get money from your sister. I'll arrange for my drink. Didn't you hear? The shops will bclose soon. I won't ask money from my poor sister for your booze. I see. You show your true colors as soon as you came here. Forget not. One tight slap and you'll come to your senses. Kill me if you wish. But I'll not ask for the money. Never! You won't? You really won't? Brother-in-law, what are you doing? We belong to the old times. This is our style of romance. Stop fighting. There'll be a problem if father comes here. Really? Then give me some money for my booze. - Shanti, don't give him money. - I don't have any. Won't you? Father is here. - Leave Uma's hand! - Father. Why should I? Isn't she my wife anymore? Or have I turned coward after coming to my in-law's place. - I'll do as I please. - I didn't know... I'd married my daughter to a lowly and brutal man like you. Now you know it. Everyone berates me... - but no one lends me money. - I say, leave her. - Else I'll break your head. - You can't even stand... - yet you're flying high. - You rascal! - Father! - What happened, Shanti? Father fell unconscious. - Father... - Father... Doctor, father will recover, won't he? Dear, go to your father. He needs you all now. Now my medicines won't work. We can only pray. Father! Father! Sister, don't worry. Your husband will get the medicines. Give me water. - Sister's fever doesn't recede. - How can it? We have neither the money for her treatment nor the medicines. First, we sold the furniture, then the jewelry. And now we're left with nothing. - My bangles, too, were sold. - What do you mean? I gave the bangles to brother-in-law to buy medicine. In spite of knowing he loves his booze more than your sister? I couldn't help it. You weren't here. How could I leave her alone? But I believe today he won't do such a thing. - He will... - Get the medicines. Believe me, I wanted to get it. With great difficulty I sold the bangles. I reached the dispensary after a lot of trouble. But the dispensary was closed. I couldn't get the medicine. - So I couldn't think of anything. - What happened later? - Where's the money? - Can't you see his state? You're right. Indeed, I was in a bad state. I was tired, your illness, my problems... I felt dizzy. There was intoxication in my eyes. And I went on to have booze. Your wife lies ill, Shanti gave you bangles, and you squandered them. You ought to be ashamed! What did you say? I ought to be ashamed? It's women who feel shy. Shanti is my sister-in-law. Never mind her jewelry. I would even sell her for my booze. But I ask you, why have you been staying here for free for a month? If you act smart, I'll kick you out of here. Ramesh, don't argue with him. Let's go. - You're drunk. - He ran away. My Shanti is inside. Who are you looking for? - Shanti is my friend. - Who are you? - My name is Chanchal (erratic). - That is obvious. - Are you a jewelers's daughter? - What? Yes. You're adorned with gold and diamonds. You look like a traveling jewelry store. Don't go there. Ramesh and Shanti are inside. - I want to meet them. - Of course. But you didn't get me? The condition is worse. Shanti's sister is ill. I mean, my wife. We don't have money even for the medicine. What if you go inside and they ask you money? - So what? - What! How much do you have? - I have some. - Give me. I'll get her the medicine. You may go in. I'll just drink the medicine. I mean, I'll get the medicine. Bye. It's been two days. The doctor hasn't even examined sister. Nor has she taken any medicine. How long will she stay like this? Don't worry, Shanti. I gave money to your brother-in-law to buy the medicine. He'll be here. Brother-in-law? - What's wrong? - Why hide from you, Chanchal? We're suffering because of my brother-in-law. Liquor has ruined him. We don't have money to buy medicine. He even sold my bangles for his booze. - Really? I didn't know that. - What can I say? After father's death, we're in deep trouble. We could have managed had Ramesh practiced well. Why don't you do something? There's no harm in working. - Job? Where will I find one? - Somewhere, at least. The owner of a theater promised me a good job. - Then? - Ramesh doesn't want me to work on stage. It isn't a question of like or dislike. You have to survive. You have an ailing sister. A young sister and a brother who have yet to complete their education. What do you want? Their happiness or false esteem? Think over it Shanti. I agree. But I can't let down Ramesh. You can at least make him understand. You'll stop working when he starts earning. I'll speak to him. But now I'm worried about sister. She's in deep pain and we don't have money for the medicine. What a disaster! The lawyer is washing dishes. What times have come? Someone has rightly said, I washed many dishes for your sake. Don't get annoyed. If you happen to break a plate... it'll be deducted from your salary. I'll leave. Secretly, slowly, we both saw each other And a magic worked The first meeting left a blush on my face I'll still remember that beautiful night It was a moonlit night. There was a music in the air The eyes met each other and I couldn't say a word I felt shy You stood silently, holding my hands Aren't you aware of the fire raging within you? - The fire is put out. - No, instead it rages beneath the ashes. Let's go. Have a seat. - Why have you come here? - To meet you. - Me? - Yes. We both have the same problem. Every evening your Shanti is at the theater and my husband is in his office. I don't know how to pass the evening. What were you doing in the kitchen? Want to know the truth? I was washing dishes. - What? Washing dishes? - Yes. - But why were you washing them? - To pass the time. What are you saying? ls there no work left for you in the world? Are you worthless? Why would you think that? - Not me, the world thinks so. - If you join hands with the wrong person... how can the world to be blamed? I feel sorry to see you like this. Why didn't you tell me before? I'm not in the habit of sharing my problems with anyone. You take me to be a stranger. But I don't. You're my neighbor. I've the right to share your joys and sorrows. I can't see you in this state. I respect your feelings. But how can you help me? You want to know? Come with me. Come. If you work for me, I would be relieved of the burden. She cares for me so much. She solved my problem quickly. Mine, too. I'll work whole heartedly. A person is respected for his work. Chanchal will decide how I'll gain from making you my assistant. After all, she recommended you. I don't believe Mrs. Dayal will ever get a chance to complain. If you're sensible enough, there's no need to complain. - You can start work tomorrow morning. - Thank you. - Today you've done my work. - My servant shirks his work. I see. Then listen carefully. Your servant won't do any work because he found a job. - You got a job? - Yes. Your friend Chanchal made me Mr. Dayal's assistant. - My salary will be 500 per month. - Really? - Yes. - Then we will enjoy. - No more of the theater. - What about the contract? It's just for 3 months. No more work after that. Then I'll enjoy living off your salary. You know what I see in your eyes today? - What? - The glitter for which I searched. The intoxication, the pleasure, the coquetry... which makes a man feel proud when he's in love. Today I can hold your hands and ask... - Ask what? - Will you be mine? - Did you write down the points? - Yes. Just read it. I'll read it later. I've to go to meet the collector. - You're leaving again? - If I don't go today... I'll miss the chance of becoming a judge. What about my evenings? With whom should I go shopping? You can go with Ramesh. Ramesh, please go with her. I thought of updating the points. - You can do it tomorrow. - Alright. I'll be back. - What happened? - A pain. - Sometimes I get this pain. - Consult a doctor. - Who'll take me to the doctor? - Mr. Dayal. Had he cared for me, why would I be in pain? My body aches. I have a fever, too. See for yourself. I think I, too, have a fever. You remember, you have to go shopping. It's getting late. A dozen silk shirts, 3 suits, 1 dress suit... - You've spent a lot on me. - Don't worry. I know how to make up for my expenses. - How? - You're quite innocent. - Do I have to explain? - Please, tell me. I've been signaling to you for a while now. You don't even see me. - I didn't see you. - Why should you? - After all, he's with you. - What's the matter? Don't ask my well-being. I haven't received money yet. Remember, I'll return every penny of yours. - I'm not here for money. - Excuse me. I don't seek alms. How much do I owe you? 50, right? Then do one thing... - What? - Lend me 50. It'll make 100. - It'll be easy to remember. Oh! You're so sensible - One small request. - Even a big one will do. - Don't tell Shanti that... - You were with Ramesh? Is this a thing to say? Why are you staring? A double. I was held up somewhere. Excuse me, darling. Let me see. Those earrings are good. Where'd you buy them? You were supposed to come early since it's a holiday. And you've come now. It's 10 PM. I was held up. Didn't you go? - How could I go alone? - That's why you got angry. Oh God! You're a great poet. There it was Chanchal and in here you're with Shanti! Aren't you ashamed to malign anyone? I might lie. At least ask the lawyer... in which court he was working at these late hours. I don't need to ask him. I trust him completely. I, too, trust him. But it's not right to roam around with... Mr. Dayal's young wife at this late hour. They were sitting in the Pride of Asia bar. It's a restaurant cum bar, you see. - Today it was tea but tomorrow... - I don't believe you. You don't? Shanti, I took Chanchal out shopping. Then we had tea. That's why I was late. Heard that? It was an ordinary thing. Ramesh, these girls have a jealous nature. Good God! - What's the matter? - I'm here to congratulate you. Congratulations! Your love and my efforts have yielded fruit. Listen, I told Shanti about what I saw yesterday. Since then, Ramesh and Shanti aren't speaking to each other. - I didn't say so. - Really? My darling... don't hide from me. It's simple. You need Ramesh, his love. - This is wrong. - Wrong? Let me hear. Your heart says something else. I've no fondness for you, dear. - Frankly speaking, I hate you. - Hate me? Because you want to break my innocent Shanti's heart. You've all the riches but Shanti only has Ramesh. You'll have to pay for snatching Shanti's love. - Pay whom? - Me. - You? - It was my doing to separate... Shanti and Ramesh and get Ramesh close to you. - The price is only 5000. - 5000? The price you'll pay to enjoy for your entire life. But Shanti and Ramesh... How is this possible? I'll make it possible. Prakash can do anything for booze. He can die and he can also kill someone. If you say, should I kill Mr. Dayal? Got scared? For how long will you love on the sly? There's a New Year program at the Pride of Asia club tonight. Shanti, too, will come there from her theater company. You'll have to get Ramesh there. I'll manage the rest. - What will happen there? - The old bonds will sever... and new bonds will be forged. Didn't you understand? Oh God! - You called for me? - Yes. - Aren't you ready yet? - I'm not feeling well. - I'm not going anywhere. - What are you saying? The commissioner has invited us for dinner on the New Year. I'm tired of these old men. I would be delighted to take you along with me. People envy my fate when they look at you. - Please come. - I've a headache. I think I have a fever, too. Let me stay at home. Okay. I'll go alone. Call the doctor. Pride of Asia bar. I'm Mrs. Dayal speaking. Book two seats for me for dinner and dance. Yes. The corner ones. Make Ramesh eat this chocolate when he comes here. Else he'll take Shanti out. If he has this chocolate... he'll become intoxicated. Take this. Pour in some more whisky. What are you doing? The whisky is quite strong. - He'll fall unconscious - I know that. Give this glass to Madam. And this one to the man... sitting with that madam. Go! Let the fire burn Let the night pass by I will not leave... this colorful party Good Lord! These eyes... can make anyone feel intoxicated I... I have forgotten my way The night is pleasant with beauties all around My heart is swaying Please don't call me today Someone stops me... whose arms are like the bottle of wine There is intoxication in the air It will be great if I become unsteady, too The mind should become intoxicated These gestures, this style... arms which are like the bottle of wine I can't remember... I can't remember, whether my love is here... or is she somewhere else? Look, I'm not in my senses Good Lord, these eyes These arms are like the bottle of wine Good Lord! These eyes... can make anyone feel intoxicated I... I have forgotten my way Can make anyone feel intoxicated I... I have forgotten my way Good Lord, these eyes... can make anyone feel intoxicated I... I have forgotten my way Shanti, forgive me. I couldn't come to take you. You see, Chanchal! She didn't let me go. I requested her so much. At last I stopped. Frankly speaking, I had lots of fun. Why are you staring? You think I've consumed liquor. Not at all. I've not had liquor. I had... lemon. Lemonade! I had lemon. Were you so ashamed of yourself you wouldn't come here? Go away. Get out of my sight! Where are you going? Come inside. Leave me. I've never been so insulted. You, too, can't insult me. Ever since you started working in the theater you've been rude to me. You think I'll stay here after listening to your threats? Do you think you've bought me? Ramesh, come inside. You're not in your senses. I'm in my senses. I've come to know your changing moods. Now I don't care for you or your money. I won't be dependent on you. I'll work for my living. - Ramesh, I'll not let you go. - Leave me. Ramesh is not dependent on anyone. He can do as he wants. Hush! Mr. Dayal might wake up. - I'll take you to your room. - You're a very nice girl. I'll reward you. I'm in my senses while making this will. Beause I don't want my wife to squander my hard earned money... for her ill vices... that's why I request the court... that after my death all my wealth... all my property should not fall into the hands of my wife, Chanchal. - When did you come? - A long time ago. Why didn't you inform me? You were unwell. I thought your health might worsen were I to wake you. What's the matter? You look troubled. Come on. - Would you benefit if I sleep? - Maybe. I'll have to suffer if you fall sick. - Tomorrow, you will come with me. - Where to? Far away, by the river side. Where, we will be all alone. - We can talk peacefully. - What have we to talk about? I'll tell you tomorrow. Now go to sleep. I have important work. You haven't married me, but my wealth. I won't give you a penny. This is my will. I've disinherited you! Please forgive me. I promise, this won't be repeated. - We'll fire Ramesh. - You'll sack Ramesh? What's the point? If lust overpowers your mind, there will be many more Ramesh's. I'll not leave the house. You can test me. Give me a chance. I don't have time for you. I can drop you in the city. Then you can go anywhere, to Ramesh or someone else. What's this? Both tires are flat. There are no taxis around. We can find transport across the river. Let's go. Help! Save me! We had been to the beach for a picnic. We were all alone. While returning, we discovered our car's tires were flat. And we could find transport only across the river. That's why we decided to row across. I stood on the river bank holding the oar. Beause there was no boatman. I said, let's row across. And he agreed. I wish I hadn't suggested it. If only he hadn't listened to me. It's destiny. How could you know the boat would capsize in the strong current? My God! I swear, you look beautiful in this black outfit. May God keep you as a widow your entire life. - Why did you come here? - Why ask such a thing? The deceased one has left you much wealth. If you don't use it properly, his soul will feel sad. I'll inform the police you killed Mr. Dayal. You're no fool. Until I've seen Mr. Dayal's will... you can take no action against me. Give me the money quickly. My throat is dry. - You're quite sensible. - Tell me if you need more. Thank you. - How many days have passed? - About 15 to 20 days. You haven't seen Shanti since then? Why meet her? If she cared for me, she would've come to me. Would she come to convince you? It's your fault. Why would she come? - I'm at fault? - Naturally. - I didn't drink purposely. And she didn't even think what I went through that night. Good that Chanchal saw me and took me home. Else I would've spent the night on the streets. I suppose every night of yours is quite pleasant. Along with Chanchal in her house. - I'm a master in all this. - What nonsense? I speak sense. You forgot Shanti and got involved with Chanchal. But Shanti didn't forget you. She will never forget you. You know she's stopped acting in the theater. She doesn't even meet anyone. I have observed many times. She comes towards your room in the night. She wanders on the terrace like an insane person, waiting for you. The moon is up again But you didn't arrive My heart burns again Oh! What do I do? This night reveals to me... gone are those days of mine My heart knows. You are no longer mine Still my eyes long to see you Oh! What do I do? I remember you My heart burns in agony Please do come, for I feel stifled now The spring season has left me suffering Oh! What do I do? I remember you The moon is up again But you didn't arrive My heart burns again Oh! What do I do? Shanti, angry with me? I knew you would never leave me alone. You would surely return. Because you, too, love me. Good Lord! I was saying this from the first day. Get out of here! Right now! Good! Why vent your anger on me? Let him go to hell. I was aware Ramesh wouldn't be trapped. - But you were crazy in love. - Don't talk nonsense. - Get lost from here. - Don't get so angry. Else your youth will turn into a fireball. Let it be. Why be sad over it? - I'm here for you. - Won't you leave? Fine. I'll leave. But the thing is... I'm in a bad state since yesterday. I haven't a dime. No booze. If you can arrange for something... Fine. Hand over the will to me. Come on. Here. Drop the toy else I'll shoot you. Remember, Prakash is not a drunkard and a nincompoop. If I could kill Dayal, I can strangle you, too. Brother-in-law, you? Now you're doomed. Everyone will come to know... - who murdered Mr. Dayal. - But the door was closed. - How could she hear? - What if she has heard? Shanti, no use hiding. You've learned all my secrets. I won't spare you alive. Come out! Shanti, come out. Beware! One step forward and I'll shoot you! You won't kill me. After all, I'm your brother-in-law. Your sister's husband. You can't shoot me. Stop! Drop the gun! I say, drop the gun! You fired? Come with me. Come on. Listen... Mrs. Dayal, a murder has taken place in your compound. - What! - I've arrested the criminal. It's a lie. Shanti could never kill anyone. She has confessed her crime. I've to call the police station. - Did you hear? - Please come. I'm lnspector Khanna. A murder has taken place at Mr. Dayal's bungalow. Yes. I've arrested the criminal. Come over quickly. Hurry up. Where's the body? In your statement you said that at midnight... while taking a stroll on your terrace... you saw two shadows in Mrs. Dayal's bedroom. It looked to you like a man was strangling a woman. After seeing this you went over to Dayal's house. Can you tell me why? It's a person's duty to help someone in trouble. You're right. On reaching there you saw Mr. Prakash strangling Mrs. Dayal. After seeing this you still turned back? Yes. Point to be noted. The convict was fulfilling her duty. And when she saw that Mrs Dayal was being strangled... she returned, forgetting her duty towards humanity. Ms. Shanti, after that Mr. Prakash started following you. Why? He thought I knew some of his secrets. - But you didn't know any? - No. - Did you tell him? - I didn't get the chance. - Or you felt it wasn't necessary. - What? Because the victim was before you and you had the revolver. Because in a moment you would get rid of all your problems. That's wrong. I didn't kill him on purpose. Every criminal standing here says the same thing. "I'm innocent. I didn't kill anyone." But the law has exposed each and every crime. Isn't it true that you killed Mr. Prakash? Yes. Maybe I killed him. You're not sure? Because I don't remember firing on him. When one gets furious, he doesn't remember anything. My Lord and the members of the jury... the convict's statement given to the police is false. The convict wants to prove she fired in her own defense. Had this been true, then Mr. Prakash's dead body wouldn't have disappeared. This proves that she had an accomplice. If so, then this murder was pre-planned. And if so, then the question of defending herself doesn't arise. The convict murdered Mr. Prakash to avenge her father's death. Mr. Digambar had fought with Mr. Prakash prior to his death. That very night he passed away. And that very moment the convict thought of murdering Prakash. Sir, this was not an accident. It was pre-planned. Look at her face. She has confessed her crime. But she doesn't repent. She killed her sister's husband. But she's not ashamed at all. Such a murderer, sinner... and a criminal should be sentenced to death. Does the defense lawyer wish to interrogate? - No my Lord. - The court is adjourned. - Why didn't you interrogate? - No use Mr. Ramesh. The case has become weak after Ms. Shanti's confession. - You mean, you won't do anything? - We can plead for mercy. - Before the judgment? - Ramesh, you're a lawyer. The world will wait for judgment. But we know what that judgement will be. - What? - Death. I'll pay you whatever you demand. Just save Shanti. It's not in my hands to save her. It's a lost case. She has confessed her crime. I regret, to what extent will you deceive the law? The most renowned of lawyers can't save your Shanti. You're the most renowned lawyer of the city. If you wish... you can prove the allegations of the police baseless. No lawyer can save Shanti from being hanged. I'll earn a bad name if I accept this case. - Will I be hanged? - No! You are innocent. The Lord never punishes the innocent, Shanti. Don't have so much trust on my life. You will only find despair. - You'll go mad with grief. - What are you saying? I thought I lost you. You're no longer mine. - If only it were possible. - What are you saying? It would have been easier to die without you. But not now. Don't cry. No... I'm not crying for myself. I feel sad for you. How will you bear to hear me being executed? How will you be distanced from me? Don't talk like that. No one can separate us. I'll save you. I'll fight the law for you till the last moment. Until my dying breath I'll pray for you. But still, if I'm unable to save you, you won't die alone. You'll find me with you. Ramu in your statement you said that on the night of the murder... you saw a woman following a man in the garden. Can you identify them? I couldn't see the man. But yes, forgive me dear. I swear by the holy book, I won't lie even for my daughter. You were chasing that man with a gun. Your witness please. Where were you employed earlier? - In Benaras. - And you were arrested for a murder there. You were imprisoned for five years. - Is it true? - Yes. Mr. Khanna, how were you so sure that Mr. Prakash was dead? He wasn't breathing and had no pulse. You aren't a doctor. How can you prove... the ability to examine a person? - I don't have any. - If not, then isn't it possible... you might make a mistake while examining? - It's possible. - If that's true... then can it be possible that Mr. Prakash isn't dead? Now when we assume him to be dead, he might be alive. Just like you and me. Isn't it possible? Quite possible. Mrs. Dayal, when did you come to know of the murder? Around midnight. I was thirsty. I came downstairs to get water. The door opened all of a sudden. And lnsp. Khanna entered holding Shanti's hand. I saw... One minute. Was the door of your house opened at midnight? Yes. Probably my servant, Ramu, forgot to lock it. - Was it Ramu or someone else? - What do you mean? You might have gone out and forgot to lock the door. Since my husband's death I've never stepped outside. - At least not at night. - Anyway, what happened later? Insp. Khanna told me everything. My servant Ramu, too, came there when he heard this. Insp. Khanna wanted to call the police station. - That's why we went upstairs. - Excuse me, who went upstairs? - I, Mr. Khanna, Shanti and Ramu. - Ramu, too? - Yes. - But Khanna's report states... that only he, you and Shanti went upstairs. There was no one else. When you all came down... Ramu was not to be seen. He didn't even go along with... you all to the room from where Mr. Prakash had disappeared. Possible. I was scared. And I forgot whether Ramu... - was there with me all the while. - But Mr. Khanna didn't forget. He fulfilled his duty. His report states Ramu wasn't with you. The reason being, he was finishing your incomplete work. Because you killed Mr. Prakash! If your accusations turn out to be false, you'll be responsible. - Certainly. - The proof, please. Alright. Ms. Chanchal, when Mr. Khanna saw the dead body and Ms. Shanti... it's clear the round should've been fired at Prakash's chest. But the reports say the round was found below the chest. Can you tell me why? The witness can't answer this question. When the murder took place, the door was closed. There was no one else inside besides Prakash and Shanti. That's what I want to say. There was no one else in the room. But there was someone outside. The doors were closed. But the door needn't be open to fire at someone. It should be noted the glass of the right window was broken. The police report states the round was... found on the right side below the chest. If this is true, then Ms Shanti didn't fire at him but... someone else who stood on the right side near the window. And the one who stood near the window ran inside the house... and forgot to lock the door. When the lnsp. was making the call... her servant carried the dead body and was trying... hard to save his mistress from the clutches of the law. Tell me, why would Ms. Chanchal murder him? What would she gain by killing Mr. Prakash? I would like to have permission to question her. Permission granted. Mrs. Dayal, are you positive you never loved anyone except Mr. Dayal? I will repeat. The defense lawyer shouldn't concern himself with the witness's personal life. It's against the law. I believe you know the conclusions arising from such questions. An innocent's life depends on these questions. I'll request the court to permit me to ask the questions. You may proceed. Are you sure you haven't loved anyone besides Mr. Dayal? I swear by the holy book, my deceased husband was my lord. I didn't ask about the Lord. Anyway, did Mr. Dayal have an affair with another woman? That's a lie! I won't hear anything against my husband. - Don't defame him. - You want to say... - Mr. Dayal only loved you. - Certainly! - He trusted you, your love. - Yes! - He didn't doubt you? - Not at all! Then why did he disown you in his will? Why did he accuse you of being a wanton woman? Why did he prove you to be untrustworthy and a cheat? That's a lie, a blatant lie! But Mr. Dayal's statement can't be false. This is Mr. Dayal's will. In this he has accused... his wife of being unchaste. And he disowned her. Can the defense lawyer tell us how he got Mr. Dayal's will? Before revealing this secret I'd like to request the... court to permit me to ask Ms. Chanchal some more questions. You may proceed. Just answer in yes or no. - Did you know about this will? - No - Did Mr. Prakash know? - I don't know. You both were on a picnic when the mishap occurred. - Yes - There was nobody else. - No. - Then who punctured the car's tires with a knife? - Answer me! - I don't know. Since the tires were flat, you both wished to go in the boat. - Yes. - The boat was ready but the boatman wasn't around? - That's right. - Do you know how to swim? - Yes. - Mr. Dayal didn't know? - No. But the person that punctured the tires knew it. He arranged for the boat and the oars. He pushed Mr. Dayal into the water with your help. - While he was drowning... - That's a lie! - I was all alone there. - You said that before, too. And everyone believed you. But today they won't. Mr. Prakash was there with you. This boatman is the proof. - He's the boatman. - This is deception. Mr. Ramesh has bribed the boatman to speak against me. As long as God protects the innocent, I need not bribe anyone. You can hide your crimes... but the blood of the innocent one reveals the murderer. Today is the test between truth and falsehood. And the law says Mr. Prakash killed Mr. Dayal. And you in turn killed Mr. Prakash. Mr. Dayal was murdered because of the will he made. And Mr. Prakash was killed because he had this will. And because he was blackmailing you for money. You didn't kill Mr. Dayal, but he was killed with your help. And at your behest. I would like to remind the court this case is related to... Mr. Prakash's murder and not with Mr. Dayal's death. The defense lawyer with his wild imagination and... statements has invented a strange story. But he hasn't presented any proof. Whatever he said about Mr. Dayal's death might be true to some extent. But how can we ignore the fact that Ms. Shanti murdered Prakash? It's true that the glass of the right window was broken... and he was fired on the right side. But this is a coincidence. This can create a doubt, but can't hide the reality. The convict has confessed her crime. Only the two of them were present in the room. There's no proof of Ms. Chanchal being outside the room. My friend, the defense lawyer's statements... and his dramatic representations can't save the criminal. It has been proved that Ms. Shanti is the criminal. Has the defense lawyer anything more to say? It's been said that Mr. Prakash came to seek refuge in your compound. Can you tell me why he came to your place and nowhere else? Mr. Prakash could give you the answer were he still alive. Were he still alive? - You, too, are sure he's dead? - Everyone believes it but you. Maybe I'm wrong. Last night while strolling outside your place I saw something strange. You know there's a old stable in your compound? I saw someone coming out of the stable. He jumped in the garden and escaped. He was wearing a black outfit. He was limping and used a cane. - Just like Mr. Prakash. - That's a lie. Nonsense! No! This is the fact. Else I wouldn't get this will. The law can do injustice, hang an innocent person. But you know who fired on Prakash. But the one you thought to be dead is still alive! Along with it, lives the law and justice! Don't trust me? Look there! He's here to give a statement for the sin you committed. The power of justice has exposed every lie. Every criminal who tried to hoodwink the law... has been hanged to death. The law is the ultimate proof... that a criminal cannot overcome the law. And today the law and justice will not spare you. Look at him. He's the one on whom you fired. You said, he was dead. He was your accomplice. No one can lie by the holy book. If one does his life becomes a living hell. Speak, who's the murderer? Or Prakash will reveal all your secrets. Who is the murderer, speak up! Or Prakash will expose you. Who's the murderer, speak up? - Or Prakash's murderer... - Yes, I fired on him! I tried to kill you because you killed my husband. You can't harm me. Stop! You're right Ms. Chanchal. Mr. Prakash is dead. His body lies at the same place where you hid it. My Lord, Ms. Chanchal has confessed her crime. That's all. Since Ms Chanchal has confessed, the court orders the police... to take her into custody immediately. And Ms. Shanti, you are free to go. God be praised, you agreed with me And my world is alright again I made you laugh, taught you to love Won't you at least say 'thank you'? I know you didn't call me... but is my company so intolerable? I just came along but you ignore me God, you're something else!
