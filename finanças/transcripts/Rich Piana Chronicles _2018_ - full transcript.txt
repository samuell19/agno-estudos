[gloomy music] [Rich] A lot of people don't really comprehend exactly what 5% means. And it's-- it's-- it's not only about the physique, you know, it's about everything. I think what I'm doing is just so different than what-- what everyone else is doing. And really important is you have to-- you have to find your niche, you know, and everyone has a different niche. And it has to be something that people are not going to get tired of. What I stand for is I educate people and I motivate people. And I think those are things that you really could never get tired of. You know, I'm not trying to be a certain character and so I think that's important. I think that just me telling the truth is very important. And I bring things out that a lot of people won't talk about and educate and motivate. And I think that's where my success is, is because of that. [radio tuning in] [rock music] [Rich] Good fucking morning! [birds chirping] [alarm rings] All Day You May, goddammit. Good motherfucking morning! Normally I would get up and take a shot of growth, but I'm out of growth hormone and it's been harder and harder to get the actual real growth hormone American-- from American pharmacy. And you can go to longevity doctors but it's a fortune, which I can afford but I just still just can't see paying that much money. So-- so right now I'm not taking growth currently and I actually just take a very small dosage. It's-- a longevity dose would be two IUs a day. And it's really more just, you know, to feel good, hair, skin, you know, longevity reasons. It's not really for the bodybuilding reasons I did back in the day. But this drink I can drink because it has no sugar or carbs but it has BCAAs. So when I do take the growth in the morning, I can-- I can feed my muscles and not interrupt the function of the growth hormone. So-- so it's a beautiful thing. But it's still a habit. When you wake up in the morning, you've been fasting all night, you know, you haven't eaten anything and the best thing you do is, you know, get those BCAAs right to your muscles. So that's the first thing I do is I still have that obsessive, you know, keep those muscles growing and healing. So it's 7:00 a.m. and I don't really have a set schedule. I get up at all different times depending on what's going on in my life. And, you know, 7:00 a.m. is the time to get up today. I went to bed at, you know, 3:00 a.m. last night, so I was up late editing and so forth. So I try to get at least four hours of sleep and, you know, I shoot for eight but that rarely happens. So I got to get up, get this motherfucking day started. And the beanie cap, the beanie cap is basically I wake up and my hair is combed. So I don't have to comb my fucking hair in the morning. So basically for me to get ready, I don't really have to do shit. I fucking brush my teeth and put some deodorant on, I take a shower. But normally I like to take a shower at night before I go to bed. And then I put the beanie cap on we hit the sack. I wake up and I'm clean, fresh and ready to roll, you know, because I get a busy day and I don't have time to dick around the house. I obsessively brush my teeth, probably five, six times a day. And as you guys can see, I'm obsessive with everything. My teeth are white now as fuck. And that's the way I like to keep them. And as far as lotions, I'm a big lotion guy. I put lotion on my fucking face about three times a day and I keep it moist and oily so I don't get wrinkles. I try to look as good as I can in every way possible. It's not just about my body or having muscles, it's-- it's everything, you know. It's just, it makes you feel better about yourself. If we're going to be there, why not be the best we can be in every way possible? So when it comes to everything, you know, I just try to be best I can be in everything. And, all right Now I'm going to pick out a fucking shirt. Got a shirt to wear for the day. I basically got every color you can imagine. You know, what I wear. I just wear my own-- my own clothes, Love It Kill It. So it's pretty easy. I probably wear a tank top about four or five times before I throw it out and get another one. So I'm pretty spoiled. You know, I have my own clothing line. I have my own food prep. You know, I have my own supplements. So the advantage of that is-- is incredible and I take full advantage of it. All right. All right. Got my All Day You May, go downstairs, make some breakfast. I do have to say I'm quite spoiled, quite the easy life. [he laughs] -[woman] Mark. -[man] I have no idea. [woman] All right, we're good. [man] So I think we should start with an introduction, maybe just say your full name -and where you're from originally. -Okay. -Whenever you're ready. -And I'm looking at you the whole time, right? -The whole time, yeah. -Okay. I was born and raised in California and I was raised in South Sac with my mom and also in Los Angeles with my dad. They divorced at an early age, two years old. So I was back and forth, you know, my whole life. And actually for me it was very enjoyable childhood because I had, you know, just all kinds of, you know, diversity and different kinds of kids growing up and I had a great time. You know, I had a great childhood. You know, we were-- we were poor, you know, we lived in low-income housing, you know, food stamps. But, you know what? I got to say that I had a great upbringing and-- I wouldn't have changed anything. My-- my mom was a competitive bodybuilder and so I was kind of raised in Gold's Gym. So at the age of six, you know, I was in Gold's Gym playing with my little toys, my little GI Joes, and so forth and, you know, not really paying attention to where I was, just kind of doing my own thing. And I went every single day to Gold's Gym, you know, at the age of six. And, you know, I don't know if you guys remember that there was old dolls called He-Man dolls and those came out and they were just, you know, these guys with these huge muscles and I was super intrigued, you know. So I look at those dolls and just be intrigued with the muscles. And, you know, basically I was either going to be a bodybuilder or be gay, one or the other. So, luckily I ended up a bodybuilder. But I remember one day playing with the dolls and having them fight each other and whatever and, you know, I looked up and I actually saw like real guys that looked like these dolls. It's the first time I really noticed like where I was and what was going on around me and I was just-- now-- I mean, now there's the real fucking superhero right here live in person, you know. So I was just intrigued and so I just started watching these guys and see what they do and watching them work out. And, you know, and before I knew it, you know, I was trying to go on the gym floor and copying them, you know, and do the same thing. And, you know, they-- they-- the Gold's Gym, you know, I was six years old, they're like, yeah, you need to keep your kid over here, you know. So, you know, I started training at, you know, like nine, ten and by eleven I was like training regularly. You know, like every time I went. And I started competing at fifteen. So I was on stage at fifteen years old, you know, which is, you know, pretty remarkable. And, you know, I just loved it. So, supplement time, goddammit. So, Mentality-- Mentality is-- is my version of Adderall. I'm not supposed to say that but, you know, what, fuck it, I'm going to say it. So it's my version of Adderall. You know, I was taking Adderall maybe three or four times a week and as you guys know or maybe not know, it is an amphetamine, so it's probably not the safest thing to be taking, you know, as part is of this two-hundred and, you know, what am I now, maybe seventy pound bodybuilder. You know, blood pressure might be a little bit off. The reason I took Adderall is it just does amazing things with my brain. I could have a phone conversation and the things that come out of my mouth are words I've never even used in my life. They just come out of nowhere. So-- so it's an incredible drug. I come up with, you know, different concepts, different ideas. And business-wise, Adderall helped me tremendously. So I wanted something made that was equivalent but legal and safer. So that's the Mentality. So I take the Mentality every morning, which I don't suggest because your body will get used to it and will not work as good. Liver & Organ, all right. Now, looking at me you guys know I take steroids, correct? It's pretty fucking obvious. So, needless to say, you know, it does its damage and I'm aware of that. I'm willing to take-- I'm willing to, you know, take my chances but I'm going to do it as safe as possible. So this supplement was probably the best supplement I ever came up with is it's created specifically for bodybuilders that are abusing their bodies with drugs, with steroids and growth hormones and so forth. So it's a-- you know, it was made, you know, to help the kidney-- the kidneys, the liver, you know, the heart, the prostate, skin, everything associated with, you know, steroid abuse. The biggest question I get constantly is how do I get bigger. And everyone knows the answer but they continue to ask the question. And the obvious answer is you fucking eat more, right? It's kind of like overweight women that ask the question, I-- how do I lose weight? I just can't seem to. I don't know, you really don't know how to lose weight? You really honestly are asking me that question and you really don't know the answer or are you just wasting my fucking time? The answer obviously is you eat less, right? You eat less and you up your activity. Everyone knows the answer but people act like they don't. So, eat more motherfucking food. That's what I'm trying to say. And the more you eat, the bigger you're going to get. The more activity you do, the more calories and more your body turns into a machine and the faster you're going to grow. I can distinctively remember looking at a Flex magazine and I even remember who was on the cover. It was Tom Platz. And he was on the cover of Flex magazine and I believe it was a Lamborghini or a Ferrari and he was standing next to the Lamborghini or Ferrari, he had a brunette and a blonde, you know, that were gorgeous and he's got this incredible body. And obviously at an early age I'm like that's what I want to be. So-- so that's-- that's when I was like, you know, I really want to become a professional, I want to turn this into a career. And the thing is, is at that early of an age, you know, I believed, you know, that a top bodybuilder is, you know, making as much money as a top basketball player or, you know, a top football player. And I was under the illusion that, you know, that they just had everything, you know. So that was-- that was my goal. Thing is, is I-- in my life I have nothing I have to do. I don't have to do shit today. I can go upstairs and go back to bed. I can sit here and watch TV all day. I can go on Facebook and scroll to the newsfeed for two hours, you know. I-- I-- there's-- I don't have to do anything. I-- as far as money, I'm fine, I'm fully taken care of for the rest of my life. There's nothing I have to do. But that is probably the most difficult situation you could ever be in and it's funny because people will say, man, you know, I can't wait till I retire. I can't wait till this and that. You know, the thing people don't understand is that's the most difficult way to live is to not have to do anything because it's so easy to just not do anything. And, you know, when you're not being productive, you know, it's not a good feeling. And that's why a lot of people, movie stars, you know, music stars, you know, get hooked on drugs, they commit suicide because they're not happy with their lives because they-- they've got to a point where they don't have to do anything, you know, and they don't. And so it's really, really important to, you know, continue pushing forward and doing everything you can in life. And I'm constantly, constantly setting goals, you know, new goals, business goals, you know, to keep myself going. But I'm telling you, this situation, believe it or not, is a difficult situation. What-- what we did is we ate a half a can of Chef Boyardee Raviolis and four whole eggs and I ate that four to five times a day every single day. And I did this for a year and our meals cost us about seventy cents each. So I was spending seventy cents each on a meal, you know, and so we struggled and I was- we struggled so much that I-- I would-- when I-- when I went number one in the bathroom, I would only flush the toilet so many times, like I would-- I would pee three times before I flushed it because I was trying to save on the water. I wouldn't turn the air conditioning on. I wouldn't turn the heat on. And for a year, we went without and we struggled. I won three shows in a row, I won the overalls, and then I entered the California State bodybuilding championships. And back then that was a very, you know, big show. Me winning the California wasn't supposed to happen. There was a favorite, you know, and he was incredibly large, incredibly massive, he had everything going for him, he had the publicity, and I really wasn't anticipating winning, you know. I wanted to, I was giving it my all but it was pretty obvious that he was going to win that show. And I won. I was anticipating, you know, a huge sponsorship, you know, from a company and I thought that this is it, like, I-- I- I made it, you know. And, you know, the phone never really rang, you know. And it was an incredible experience and that night was probably the-- you know, the most memorable night of my life. And after that, it just kind of like, you know, everyone forgot about it. And that's when I started kind of like what's going on here? So, I have Chanel coming over. And Chanel is my ex-girlfriend before I recently got married. And as you guys know, I'm in the process of a separation. So, wow, a lot of shit going on here. So, the thing is, is that when I was with Chanel, she's my videographer, and she was really, really, really good, you know, with the videos and editing and filming and, you know. So, you know, when we broke up, it was like, "Fuck, now what am I going to do?" And now that I'm not with my wife, I figure, you know, maybe give Chanel a call and see if she's interested in working for me. You know, why not? Because, you know, she-- she knows what she's doing, you know, she's-- she's good at what she does. So-- so she's on her way over. And she has not seen the house. And the house isn't finished yet, you know. It's-- -it's-- you know, it's nice, it's big... -[cell phone rings] but it definitely needs some work. So she's going to help me continue decorating the house and getting it finished. And this is her right now, goddammit. And I didn't answer it in the time. Hopefully she calls back. Yeah, so this should be interesting. And I'm going to walk her through the house. She'll give me her-- her ideas and-- -[doorbell rings] -There she is, goddammit. Hello! -How have you been? Good. -What's up? How are you doing? -Long time no see. -Really long time. -.How have you been? -Good, good, good. I don't-- I don't-- I mean I need something over here, I think. -Don't you think like something? -Yeah. And then I thought about maybe putting a little, -you know-- -Like a dining room-- -Little dining room table maybe. -Like a small dining room table. -Or bar stools, I don't know. -I like the idea of bar stools personally. I don't see you sitting in a dining room table. I think that that would just be wasting the money. And I kind of like the open-- the openness, you know. That's why I really like this house. And you know-- you know, the houses I like, I like to be open. -Yes, Ben and Jerry's every night. -[Chanel laughs] -Look at that. Yeah. -Why am I not surprised? Some things never change. And people out there, when I talk about Ben and Jerry's-- it's not-- -I'm not telling you that's what you need to do-- -[cell phone alert] --to develop a great physique. That's just what I do because I enjoy Ben and Jerry's. It's not a good thing, it's a bad thing but it tastes good. You guys ever seen a-- look at this, twenty-four karat gold fucking knife. -Oh, wow, that's heavy. -I only got it because it was gold. And then my wedding ring. But I'm a very smart person. So this ring has five diamonds. So being it has five diamonds, it's basically five percent. So I just take the ring and I put it on the other finger and it wasn't a waste of money. Now I have a sick-ass five percent ring. Boom, five carats. See, I think. -You always think. You never stop. -I think. Usually a lot of times back then the guy that won that California is the favorite, you know, because California is the Mecca, you know. So the guy that wins the California more than likely is going to, you know, be the top state winner to win the USA. So I had a-- a lot of hype going into it, people were talking about me and it seemed like it was going to be a win, you know. So I gave everything I had for a full year and I did nothing else but bodybuilding. I would not go to the movies. I mean, it sounds ludicrous but that's how driven I was. Giving everything I had for that year and not winning, you know, was just-- it just killed me. I think that was-- that was pretty much, you know, what destroyed my desire. And I continued to compete because I was addicted. I was addicted to the sport and I still love the whole aspect. But as far as giving it everything I got, I was pretty much not willing because the reward, I got nothing back. I tell people my slogan is, you know, you got to do-- be willing to do whatever it takes. You know, whatever it takes, you got to be willing to do it. Well, yeah, but you're getting rewarded for giving it everything it takes. You know, in business, in school, in whatever you're doing in life, you're giving everything it takes, you're being the best but you're getting rewarded back for, you know, giving everything you got. You know, if you do everything you can and you give your heart, your soul, your fucking everything and you get nothing back, -it's like what's the fucking drive to, you know. -[man] True. And I think that's-- that slowly is just what, you know, what killed me is-- is I'm willing to do whatever it takes but I'm not getting anything back. Problem-- my problem is why do I keep getting big houses. There's no point. -Go big or go home, right? -Yes. And you're just that guy who has a big home. So this is-- this is where all the magic happens. -So this will be where I will be editing all of your new videos? -Yes. This is where all the magic happens. So I have two computers and two people can be in here editing at the same time. And I got my boy Mike here. Mike's one of my top sales guys -and he's here visiting for, what-- you are here for a week? -Hi. For a week, yes. So he's-- he-- he's just fucking getting all my shit in all the stores here. And he's doing a good job. So-- so it's cool. And he just stays here, no reason to get a hotel, I got so many rooms. We're just going to together like just fucking roll around the stores, you know, and just get the-- get this shit fucking-- get the shit going. Ronnie Coleman went in an RV fucking all around like for like eight months. [Mike] He did a tour of America. -Yeah, and it's like, fuck, that's a good idea. -[Mike] Yes. You know, if I can just get an RV and just fucking tear it up. Yeah, being face to face with people and it's better morale -and you're like right there in front of them. -Yeah. Yeah, it's good shit. So, yeah, this is where I spend most of my time is in this fucking office editing. And as you guys can see-- This is-- this is an example right here. Look at this shit. And I was completely done with bodybuilding. I had no interest, you know, in the sport. I loved training, I loved eating, I loved going through the motions of being a bodybuilder. Just as far as being on stage, you know, and being involved in the industry, I was pretty much done and over it. And, you know, a supplement company got a hold of me and they said they wanted to sponsor me. And it was like, where the fuck were you ten years ago when I needed a goddamn sponsor? You know, they-- they hit me up and they wanted to sponsor me. And I said I'm not a bodybuilder, I'm not going to compete, I don't think I'm what you guys want, you know. And they're like, no, no we want what you have, we like your look and we like your philosophy and what you're doing and you're doing it for the love of the sport, you're doing it because you enjoy it, you know, you're not doing it for anyone else, you know. And at this point in my life I was-- I was pretty financially well-off and I had a lot of good things happen in my life and I didn't need the money, you know, I didn't need the supplements. I really didn't need it. It wasn't going to really help me that much. But talking to them and being able to do the things I wasn't able to do when I was in the sport, you know, being at a booth and greeting fans and taking pictures and, you know, making really cool videos was something I never, you know, did. So I was like, wow, this sounds like it might be fun, you know. So, if anything, I'll do it for fun. -[Chanel] Is that Brion? -[Rich] That's Brion. [Chanel] Wow. [Rich] It truly is unbelievable what these guys do and what they put themselves through and how much work goes into, you know, competition. And I have to say that I definitely do not miss competing. It is fucking hell, torture. And the sad thing is, is there really isn't much payoff, you know, and it's kind of the same with MMA fighters, you know. They-- they do so much, they go through so much, they work so hard and they put so much at risk and they really get nothing in return. I mean, you just have to really truly love what you're doing and, you know, doing it for yourself, not-- you know, not for any kind of compensation because there really is no compensation. And it really sucks. And that's why I've always wanted to promote my own shows just so I could give back to the athletes and give them what they deserve. You know, it's like they-- they spend so much money, they put so much time and they get a five-dollar trophy, you know, and it's just really sad. And I would-- I don't see why the promoters can't take the money they get from the entry fees that is giving from the athletes and give it back to the athletes. So you're not-- you're still making money, you know, there's no reason to be greedy and have to make every fucking dime you can. You know, give back to the athletes. And some of the contests out there, you know, they-- they'll get three hundred thousand dollars in entry fees, you know. And if they could give that back to the competitors, which they could easily, the competitors deserve it. And it really sucks that they get nothing, you know. And the problem is, is that they keep doing it. You know, they keep doing it. So, you know, it's never going to change because the promoters don't have to give anything. They let me, you know, put in my two cents and, you know, do what I wanted to do and-- and it was great. And I was having a great time, you know, flying around. Starting to have a following and be able to do motivational videos and motivate people and have people constantly, oh, my God, you saved my life and you helped me, and I was this and that and I was depressed and, you know, I was-- I was hooked on drugs and, you know, you-- I was-- you know, and just all the time people tell me these incredible stories. It was-- it was just amazing, you know, what all of a sudden I'm doing out of nowhere. The sad thing is people don't give a fuck about training, you know. They don't care about watching these bodybuilders -that kill themselves getting conditioning. - Yeah. They're training really hard, they have great physiques. They'd rather watch me eat a double cheeseburger from In-N-Out. True. And it was crazy as these videos are the hardest to edit. -They take so much time and energy to shoot-- -Mhm. -to get it everything angle right, get the muscles everything, the lighting right, that filters right and everything perfect and then they don't do that good. And then you do a fucking video of going and eating pancakes at IHOP and -get four-- four times as many views-- -I know. -and there's no editing involved, there's no-- don't give a fuck about lighting-- -You just like throw it up and they are done. -Yeah. So that's crazy. My best video got a million in four days. -What was it? -It was the-- it was crazy. It's-- it's the thumbnail, look, right here. Six-eleven-- -Six-foot-eleven, three-hundred-eighty-pound Monster Big Joe Motherfucking Arm Day-- -Like in four-- -Monsters Do Exist. -In four weeks, it has-- -It's got over two millions. --two million. -So, it's really-- -You have a knack for finding the most interesting people. Hell yeah. Everyone-- they don't want to see the same shit, you know, because bodybuilders, they all look the same, right? People ask like how much money do you make on YouTube, you know, how do you get started on YouTube, you know, how- and, you know, it's-- it's an incredible thing because, you know, back ten years ago you had to pay for marketing, and marketing is the most important thing when it comes to the business, you know, is marketing the product. It doesn't matter how good a product is, product can be amazing but if no one knows about the product, you're not going to sell any, you know. And it's not going to be successful and there's plenty of products out there that are shit but they do so good at marketing the product that, you know, they make millions. And, you know, so YouTube is an outlet where I can market myself and market my products and I get-- actually get paid. So I'm getting paid to market my products and that's just an unbelievable thing. It's so much easier than it was ten or fifteen years ago and, you know, it's-- it's-- I-- I constantly do videos and talk to people and explain that, you know, it's a lot easier to be successful nowadays and, you know, all it takes is work, determination and, you know, just keep on pushing forward. You know, indirect marketing, you don't-- you don't need to shove something down someone's throat, you know, to get them-- all they need to do is be aware of your product and they can make-- they can make up their mind whether they want to try the product or not. Yeah. You know, there's-- you don't-- you're not trying to shove it down their throat. And I think that's where companies make the mistake. Yeah. YouTube is just always changing their shit, it's hard to keep up. There's a sixty-five-year-old couple that'll come and say we watch all your videos and they-- they've never even stepped foot in a gym, you know. They just-- they're entertained to a certain degree. And what people like the most is, you know, I'll do a video and I'll talk about, let's say, day trading. You know, and people get really intrigued because the way I explain it is, you know, you fully understand what I'm saying. You-- you watch-- you go to a seminar about day trading, you're fucking lost. And I think me talking about it, it makes you realize like, wow, this shit really isn't that complicated, it's pretty easy. So a lot of the motivation I give is, is advice on that. And people seem to enjoy that more than the training because you-- you know, you can find the training advice everywhere. Food time. Are you going to eat, brother? [Mike] Yeah, man, I'm going to grab one of those meatloaf cauliflower mash, freaking bomb. -It's crazy, right? -Yeah. How can they make cauliflower taste like mashed potatoes? I-- I mean I thought it was mashed potatoes the first time I ate it until I read it. Dude, have you tried the cauliflower fucking macaroni and cheese? -No, I haven't had that one. -Oh, my God. -Yeah. -It tastes just like macaroni and cheese and there's no carbs. -It's crazy shit. -Yeah. -You see how we fucking-- we Saran-- we Saran wrap these-- -Right. Airtight, you know, why? I remember I was with that company-- I can't remember the name of it, but I was getting sponsored. Right, yes. So one time I was carrying a bunch of their food and shit -and I went like this and-- -Busted. -It was all over the fucking floor-- -Right. -Like six meals. So-- -Yeah. -Look. -Nothing. -Fucking can't spill. It's spill-free. -Didn't even-- nothing-- So, chicken and broccoli. Chicken and broccoli. -So what time does your plane leave? -10:30. No one's really said anything or done anything against me, you know, as far as what I've done. I wanted to-- I want to let people know about everything to do with the industry. You know, all I'm doing is I'm trying to help people. I'm trying to let them realize what they're getting into. Gold's, Hollywood or Venice, either one. -No, not Hollywood, North Hollywood. -North Hollywood, yeah. -Hollywood's gay. -Yeah. You're right, you're right. I've been-- I've been in that one. It's all good. But it's always too packed. What I noticed, it's too packed there. -Yeah, it's crazy. -And I could-- I can never even get a bench in front of the dumbbell rack -the times I've been there to work out, so. -Yeah, it's crazy. It's fucking-- Yeah. That gym makes so much fucking money. [rock music] [Rich] I believe that if you see a guy like Tony Robbins in a suit, your first thought is, you know, this guy had rich parents, he went to Harvard, he got a degree and now he's trying to tell me how to be successful. I would never relate with Tony Robbins and listen to him and believe that I can follow his footsteps, you know, because his foots that-- he's coming from a totally different place than me. But I think people knowing my story and knowing that I came from low-income housing and, you know, I had no money growing up, I think they can relate to me. So when I start motivating and talking about, you know, what you need to do and how you need to go about doing it, I think they-- they-- they can use that information and feel like that I'm similar to them, you know. And so hearing it from me is different than hearing it from other people and they can relate. Big squeeze, big squeeze, hold that squeeze. There it is. There it is. Yeah. -Come on. -Yup, yup. Come on, goddammit, get it up, get it up, up, up, up, up, up, up. Yeah. Never give up. -Whatever the fuck it takes. -Yeah. Shoot. -Big, brother big. -Hey. Yep. Big. Vascular as fuck. Right on. Give me a sec. Perfect. -So, you just turned pro? -Yeah. You've been trying to turn pro for how long? Long motherfucking time. -Almost ten years. -Yeah. -It's a long, long, long fucking road but congratulations. -Thank you. Fucking hung in there. And I know we're talking about sponsorship. And I want you to shop around and I want you to, you know, get a feel for what's out there and get a feel for what companies could do for you before you make that decision because it's an important decision. And most companies, what they're going to do is they're going to lock you in. So they're going to lock you in for like a two-year contract. And what that means is, you know, you can't go somewhere else. So if someone else comes and offers you five thousand dollars a month and you're only getting whatever, you're stuck, you know. And the bodybuilding career is short, you know, it's-- it's not the longest career. So it's-- I personally never liked being locked into a contract. And so when I started my company, I made the contract open. So you can leave at any time and we can let you go at any time. Another thing is the marketing. You know, a lot of athletes don't realize the importance of the marketing aspect. And honestly, I don't think you realize the importance of the marketing aspect, you know. But look at someone like me who's not pro, never turned pro but, you know, look how well I'm doing in the industry as far as making money and being successful without being a pro, you know. So it's very important to market yourself, so... A lot of people don't really comprehend exactly what 5% means. And it's-- it's-- it's not only about the physique, you know, it's about everything. And if I meet someone who's very motivating and they have a great story and they've accomplished a lot in their life, to me they're-- they're a perfect example of a five percenter, you know. And that doesn't mean they have to be three-hundred-pound bodybuilder with abs, you know, and tattoos and whatever else. You know, that has nothing to do with being a five percenter. But a lot of people out there, that's what they think that it's all about how big you are, you know, how much you lift, you know, how tough you are, you know. And it's really not. It's really-- it's really more about the mentality than the physicality, you know. It's that-- this is just outer shell. What's inside is more important. So, you know, the way I choose the five percenters is, you know, obviously there is the outer shell, you know, that is a part of it but it's also how motivating this person is, you know, talking to them, how smart they are, and, you know, the story they have to tell. And some of these people have done amazing things in their life that it's like, wow, you know, you have accomplished a lot. So that's-- that's what we have to offer that's better than any company out there is our marketing, you know, is phenomenal as far as, you know, getting people known, getting their face out there and building a following. So it's-- it's a-- you know, it's a-- it's a hard fucking business, you know. You got to-- you got to truly love the sport to be in this sport. You know, you can't be doing it for any other reason other than you fucking truly love it. And earlier when we're talking about videos when you said you don't have time for videos and this and that, like you got to make time. And it's not-- it's not for me, it's for you because you have-- the amount-- what you get from a video if it gets a million hits, it's something you cannot get through bodybuilding. You know, you-- no matter what you do, you can't get, you know, that kind of value. As far as business-wise, you know, as a business, we-- we really need people with a following, you know, an Instagram following because we are going to market you and help you become a superstar, help you become popular, but you have to be able to market us and help us sell our products and market our products and let people know about our products. So it's a mutual, you know, working situation and we're both benefiting from it. -What's up, brother? How are you doing, man? -Good. Good to see you, man. Good to see you. -Can I get a picture with you? -Yeah, for sure, brother. All right, brother. Good to see you, man. Why you're all covered up? Why are you hiding? -Why are you hiding-- hiding all your muscles, man? What's up? -I've been telling him that. -That's how it is. -You don't feel like you're ready or what? I did a photo shoot yesterday actually. -Ooh, you did? -Yeah. Then you look at your best. What are you doing? What's your-- what's your Instagram? -You have a lot of followers or what? -Not really. -Come on, man. -I just follow you. What's up with that? You don't have a lot of followers, you're covering up all your fucking work. -We're going to have a talk. -What's that? -Got to get you on-- -This guy's shoulders are like crazy too. I know and you're hiding it. What the fuck, dude? -This one? -No, that one. Oh, shit. -This one? -Yeah. And then look at your fucking cover picture. -[woman laughs] -What the fuck? And-- and you're private! Oh, my God. You're like-- you're basically-- Like, the best advice I can give you is whatever you're doing, do the opposite. Whatever you're doing right now, do the opposite and you'll be a huge success. Hey, what's up brother? What up? Goddammit. You ready to fucking kill it? -Why not? I just fucking ate. I'm fueled up. I'm ready. Look at you with the fucking the Cripps and shit, Cripp blood. -Hey, look-- -What's up? Where are you from, homie? -Where the fuck are you from? -I'm from nowhere. Listen, Jesus Christ-- I-- I honestly I do-- I do feel pressure to look a certain way, you know. And before I got back in to the industry, I didn't have any pressure to look a certain way. But I always look the best I could and I always look the way I wanted to look. Like it all seems logical like you're going in the right direction, everything seems right. Yeah, and then it just winds up and fuck you up. And then all of a sudden you're like where the fuck am I? Every time I do it, I get-- I get lost. Oh, here's Venice right here. Right? And the cool part about it, you're not going to remember which way we just took. -[Rich laughs] -Just to beat the traffic. I don't-- This ain't Venice. All right, this isn't Venice. -That's what it's saying. -What the fuck? You know, it was enjoyable for me but I do feel a little bit of pressure to look a certain way. And, you know, that's-- that's-- that's hard because I shouldn't feel that way but I do. It's-- I feel like I do need to look a certain way for my fans. You know, if I'm sitting here and I'm-- I'm telling you this and telling you that, well, I better be following that shit, too, you know. I can't show up, you know, saying you got to do this, you got to do that and then I look like shit, you know, what is that? Hey, what's up, brother? How are you doing, brother? Long time no see. -Everything good? -Good, brother. Yeah? [man] Ready? Go. Just to kill some time-- You know, it is after a while it's just like fuck what am I doing, you know. So it was like I'd really like to do something that I believe. It was like if I had my own company, I can only create the products that I believe in. I mean, my success I think is just being honest and my marketing, I don't cramp things down people's throat, you know, it's all indirect. If you watch my YouTube channel, you don't really see me talking too much about my products, you know, it's just like they're there, you see the kind of person I am, you kind of see what kind of knowledge I have, you know, put two and two together and what do you come up with. [man] Two more. One, two. One more. One, two. Yep. [Rich] I would say I wouldn't use the word famous. I mean, I-- I-- I'm starting to become popular and I'm starting, you know, to when I go places, people knew who I am, they want to take pictures with me. And-- and, you know, I always-- I always say that, you know, I want to be Rock famous, you know, like the Rock, you know, where anywhere he goes, you know, they're like, oh, whatever you want, you know. And so I'm definitely not there yet. [heavy rock music] Got to-- we got to-- we got to make that shit hurt, right? You got to make it hurt. -Yeah. - People come in here and they just go to the motion, they don't feel nothing. You got to concentrate, slow, squeeze and that's where people fail. They don't understand that you have to make the arms work hard, you got to make the pain come. No pain no gain. I've always been into martial arts, always. Like, I love martial arts and one of the things I always wanted to do was to actually step in a ring and fight, like, that's something I've always wanted to do. So-- so I've always been involved my whole life but not that much. And then just recently with this whole guy challenging me to a fight and this and that I'm going to get in the ring with him, and, you know, I thought for sure this was going to happen. You know, I-- I am not trained, you know, to go fight rounds in a ring, you know, I'm not. My wind-- you know, the amount of muscle I have, you know, it's-- it's definitely something that I would not excel at. So I figured, you know, I need to start fucking training, you know, and be ready for this. -How are you doing, brother? -Another one in the books. -All good? Oh, you won. -Yeah. I didn't even know man. Sorry. No, I know you're busy. Yeah, yeah, that's awesome. You won a class or overall or what? I won the class 35 Masters back to back. Okay. Then I got second in the open again, so. Okay, awesome, brother. -How old are you? -Nationals. I'm thirty-eight. Wow, man. You're an old man like me. I'm-- Damn, look at this shit. This motherfucker blows up. -Yeah. -Well, this is how it goes now, so. Yeah. -So-- -Yeah, okay. Yeah, I mean like, you know, like we talked about you-- you got everything, you got the look, you know, you got the attitude, you got the mentality. Yeah, no, you look awesome, brother. You just got it-- we just got to get the social media following, you know, going. And also my suggestion would be-- go back to your main page-- my suggestion would be to put more photos of yourself-- Okay. --and better quality photos and get some-- some training photos. Like, those are all posing photos, you know. Like, get some hardcore training shit of you training, you know, and make your Instagram just like hardcore, you know, Instagram about you and about what you do. [Rich] I remember I knew nothing about social media, honestly, I knew nothing because it's not what I did. I was buying real estate, I was day trading, I had other means to make money. I wasn't involved in the supplement industry, so I knew nothing. And I started doing videos, you know, and I-- my first videos, you know, I spent a lot of money in the production value and a lot of time, a lot of energy. You know, I went out of my way to make the best fucking videos possible. I'm constantly aware of and trying, you know, like, okay, I got to be better in this company, you know. And I'm always making little goals and contests, you know, daily, you know, to accomplish certain things. And it feels so good when you accomplish it. You got it, come on. Short up. Come on. Give me that body hook. Good, yes. All right, Rich. First, your balance, okay? You lose your balance and you got to work on that, okay. Your back legs always come up a little bit, okay? Jab is very good, just need to snap a little more. Right cross, again, when you throw, you bring your body with the punch, very strong and hard, very strong punch but, you know, you lift up the back leg-- -Aa-ha. -And lean a little bit, kind of-- kind of reach too much. -So you kind of see it coming. -Yes. -And I'm off balance. -And you're off balance. -Okay. -Got you. So, sit and just turn, pivot the back leg, stretch. -Yeah. -And snap. -And stay on the heel. -Stay on the heel. -Don't go on the toe. -Exactly. -Because that's why I'm off balance. -Yeah. Body shot, you open-- -Yeah, yeah. -Too much-- too much your body. Again, you know, you got to-- everything's closed. -Right. -Stab. What else we-- I just got to-- I got to work on the hip snap. -Yeah. -Because I feel like I don't have the power -without bringing it back. -Yeah. -And again for-- -So once I get that-- that snap fully done, -you know, I won't have to bring it back. -Exactly. I'll feel confident with just boom. And again, so much muscle, your speed for all that is very good. You know. So, you get tired a little faster but everything else-- -Yeah. -heavy, heavy hand. -Yeah, my-- -Every single punch. -My wind is improving a lot too. -Yes. I feel good, you know, I can go-- I can keep going, keep going, keep going-- --you know, without getting out of breath. And like you said, it's true, the minute you-- the minute you think about you're getting out of breath, it's over. It's over. As long as you stay focused and you just keep doing what you're doing-- No matter how good you are or how strong or-- I feel like I could keep going and going and going and going, -you know, and I don't get winded. -Exactly. That one time when we were in the ring and we did two rounds-- we did two minutes, rested a minute and then two-- did two minutes. Yep. I thought I was going to die. -And you guys made me finish that two minutes strong. -Yeah. And I never-- I mean I felt like that but not in probably fifteen years of where you literally feel like you're going to die, -you know, that feeling of just helplessness. -Yep. -And then you start-- -Complete helplessness. -And then you started giving the survival punches-- -Right. --with nothing. Right. And I think it's important-- -it's important to-- to make people feel that-- -Yeah. -for people to know what that's like because that will motivate you more than anything to not ever let that happen again. -Because the-- the feeling of that, you know, the-- -You're feeling helpless. -Yeah, you're just completely helpless. -Yeah. And that's the worst feeling in the world. Both my knees have no cartilage. -Fuck you. -Yeah. Like I'm in pain twenty-four hours a day. Yeah, they're-- my knees are fucked. Can't train them, I can't do shit. You know, I can throw kicks. I tore my patella in this leg and I ended up going to LA County, which is just, you know, suicide. Right. So that wasn't necessarily done right. They were supposed to put a cadaver tendon in and they said we have the cadaver, we're ready to go and the doctor told me right as he was putting me under that the cadaver is this and that and da, da, da, I got out of surgery. Then another doctor came in. I'm like, you guys are for the cadaver, right? He's like no, no, cadaver. He goes, we don't do that here. -I'm like, motherfucker. -What the fuck. And see what I found out by the MRI is my tendon is like a piece of dental floss. It's just like all stride and it's shredded and it's like skinny and he said it's like-- it's worse than a nine-year-old girl's, you know, tendon. And so I really needed that cadaver, you know, and they didn't do it. So I did stem cells. I had stem cells pulled out of my hip, you know, and put in my leg. That cost me eleven grand. No, insurance doesn't cover. And it didn't-- it didn't even-- it didn't even do anything, yeah. So, I mean I've tried everything. The only thing left is-- is knee replacement. But they said that you'll go through that and in six months you'll destroy it by how you are and your activity and stuff and they said you're just too young for that. So I'm like fuck it, I'll just suffer. I'm just suffering through. ♪♪♪ -Yeah, that's good. -Yeah, it's good shit. I mean right now my main focus is business, you know, success and I'm very-- financial freedom to me is incredibly important, you know. And there's so many people out there that are successful and they-- they-- they might own a couple businesses but, you know, that-- what that money, that business you own, it's on paper. It's-- it's not for sure one hundred percent. So for me, you know, financial freedom of-- of having what I need to never have to worry about money is the most important thing for me right now, you know. And, you know, having a-- having a million dollar company, it's on paper. Something can happen and the company could just, you know, go down, you know, in days. So, you know, it's not a hundred percent. -So when's the fight? The fight is August-- -[instructor] August 26th. August 26th. -So I've got maybe three weeks left now. -Right. And this is it, this is-- this is the Bellator. This is on Spike TV. -Yeah. -This is-- This is the big fucking moment. It's-- it's-- it's something that just came off the blue which I like when that happens. Just came up, they called me, hey, you want to fight. I'm like I can't turn this down. And I said it's going to be a good way for me to like release some stuff -I've been going through-- -Right. -And-- and get another chance to shine, you know. -Right. But this is the opportunity. This is like the opportunity, like this is the fight, you have to win this fight. I have to win this fight. And it's a tough-- it's a dangerous fight. -It's not a question of-- -No. It's a question of you're going to win this fight. I'm going to win this fight-- And this is-- this is the big stepping stone to where you want to be. -This puts me further on the map. -Right. You know, when you can take out a guy who is making a wave and making a name for himself, -you do that-- and you said it's on the big stage. -Right. -Bellator is-- -On TV. -A big name. A big name to fight for. -On TV. And this guy-- this guy's known for being a stand-up-- -Yeah, he's a-- Yeah. -Stand-up fighter. But you're going to take his ass down. Oh, I'm looking to take him down. You know, I've got to say I might take down-- I have other business ideas. I have a lot of business ideas that I have yet to even begin that I really, really, really, you know, want to-- to bring out. That's my problem is that I'll have something going and it's going great and then all of a sudden I want to start this. You know, and it's like one thing at a time, Rich, you know, you need to keep working on this, you know, and get this one hundred percent. And I just want to go to this and then to this and then start this and then, you know, and have ten different things going, which obviously is-- is, you know, a recipe for disaster. You know, it's not going to work. You know, you need to focus on that and all your focus has to be on that and, you know, keep going. And so that's something I really have to be careful about. The thing is that I noticed a lot of fighters is they have a certain amount of pride and a certain amount of-- and so they figure this guy's a stand-up guy and everyone's telling him, you know, you can't stand up with him. You got to take him to the ground. You're not going to be able to win standing up with him. You got to take him down. And so in their head they're like, fuck this motherfucker, I don't-- I can win either way. And then they get a little cocky and they end up trying to stand up with them-- -Yeah. -And they end up losing because they didn't stick to their game plan which would have been to take his ass down. You got to kind of like-- like put that pride in the back seat, you know, and you got to do whatever it takes to win. [Rich] I-- I really enjoy marketing. And it's funny because I've had a couple companies ask me if I could help them and I have helped a couple companies, you know, discreetly and like done wonders, you know. And I think that's something that I-- I just have a certain knack for. I think everyone, you know, has a certain talent and, you know, that's something that just comes natural. And it's something that I would probably once I'm done, you know, with what I'm doing I might get into actually helping other businesses, you know, market and excel, you know, and take a company, you know, and within six months, you know, just, you know, you know, turn them around. And, you know, I did that recently with a company and it's pretty remarkable what I accomplished. And for me, it's very-- it doesn't even-- it's me even saying to myself is like that doesn't-- that's not me, you know, that doesn't fit. And it's something I just recently realized the ability I have, you know. And so it feels good. Time for Ben and Jerry's, goddammit. Ben and Jerry's diet right before I go to bed. So what do I got here? Phish Food, Half-Baked, Coffee Heath bar, cookies Empower Mint. Where the fuck did that come from? I didn't buy that shit. All right. Tonight's an easy choice. I'm going to go with the Strawberry fucking Cheesecake. That's what I'm doing. The Strawberry Cheesecake. And tonight I'm fucking doing it up. I'm going to Jacuzzi to eat my ice cream. So it's definitely the best place to eat Ben and Jerry's is in the Jacuzzi when it's a hundred and four. Second best place is in bed when you have a beautiful lady to lay next to you while you eat your ice cream. Whoo! This is fucking hot as fuck. Hundred and four degrees, goddammit. Strawberry Cheesecake. What a combination, Strawberry Cheesecake and a hundred and four degrees. My God. It feels so fucking good. Jesus Christ. Fuck yeah. I try my best to, you know, to keep everyone positive and explain to everyone that we-- we are all in this together, like we're all accomplishing the same goals, you know. We need to motivate each other and I need motivation, you know. We all need motivation. And, you know, when I help someone and they tell me I helped them, that motivates me. That keeps me, you know, pushed in the right direction. And knowing that these people are-- are looking up to me, they're counting on me, so I need to keep, you know, pushing forward and, you know, being the best I can be in every way. Whatever you do to get ready for a show, if you can take that and apply it towards anything else in life, it's unbelievable the things you can accomplish, you know. An example I use is, you know, let's say you got ready for this show. Imagine what you did for those six months getting ready for that show, you know, it's a twenty-four hour a day job. If you can apply that to something like opening a business, just imagine, you know, you'd have a successful business, you know, multi-million dollar business probably if you can apply what you learned through bodybuilding. And the problem is most people can't, you know. And that was me as a bodybuilder. I-- I did everything perfect as a bodybuilder but the rest of my life completely fell apart because I was putting all my eggs in one basket. See, the trick is you got to get a little spoon to make you feel like you're eating more. I get a big spoon, I'm done in like fucking ten bites. I feel like I got ripped off. So, with a little tiny plastic spoon so it takes like thirty bites makes it last longer. Good fucking shit. What I try to do is try to explain to people that, you know, you need to take this and use it in all aspects of your life. You know, how's your family relationship, how do you-- how are you with your parents, your brothers, your sisters, you know, how is your relationship, you know. You know, these are all things that-- that you need to work on improving. We all need to work on improving, you know. And when you're involved in the sport of bodybuilding, I believe that you put everything else over here and you just concentrate on the physique. -What's up? -What's up? What's up is a fucking-- You already started without me, what the fuck? Dude, you can't wait for me? When I give you a time, you need to be here on the time I say, brother. I'm sorry man, I'm always fucking late. -I take this shit seriously. -Goddammit. -You need to take it more seriously. -All right, goddammit. I'm ready. I'm ready. -It feels so good. -I love it. The truth be told is that I think that hate is going to affect anyone eventually. Some people right off the bat they can't handle it, you know. It's just like you see people and they are just like back and forth arguing and, you know, going back and forth with these-- you know, these people on Instagram. And the sheer fact of-- of who you are, what you've achieved, how you look, just fucking angers them, you know. There are guys out there that say I've been taking steroids for twenty years. They've been working out hard, they've been eating right, they've been doing everything they can, they just don't look like you. And it's just so fucking frustrating like, fuck, I do everything I can and I fucking can't look like this guy, you know, and it pisses them off. Knowing that anyone that takes the time to actually comment and fucking hate, you know, is-- is someone that-- that really is drawn to you and they're really-- they're going to take time out of their day to actually comment, you know. It's a compliment, you know. And if I-- if I go and I have a thousand comments, you know, and a hundred of them are-- are negative comments, it's still a thousand comments of people who took time out of their day to actually sit and say something about a simple picture. You know, so I feel like if my picture has that much power over someone where they're going to stop and look and they're going to get angered and they're going to fucking write a comment. It's like wow, that's some powerful shit right there, you know. I have the capability of fucking pissing someone off with a picture. You know what's crazy is everyone out there, you know, they think taking steroids is an advantage when it comes to MMA fighting. And they don't realize it's not. You know, it's like when I'm on a cycle and I'm doing rounds, my shoulders start burning, you know, they burn out, I can't hold my hands up because it's too much pain, I get pumped everywhere. -Exactly. -When I'm off the cycle, I can go all day. My shoulders don't burn, my shoulders don't hurt. So for me, I'm a million times better off the cycle. I mean, I'm probably not as aggressive but aggressive necessarily isn't a good thing in a fight. You don't want to-- you want to be relaxed, right? You want to be relaxed, you want to be happy. As soon as you get mad, you're like, ugh. Then you-- you-- right, you kind of-- it's not good, right? So, it's funny how, you know, fucking, you know, we learn shit. -But for me, man, off the cycle I think is better. -True. So people out there are like, motherfucker, you've never been off the cycle, what are you talking about? [Rich] It's-- it's a great feeling. You know, if you're-- if I'm walking through the mall and I see a guy and a girl walking towards me, you know, happens all the time, the guy will whisper something in his girlfriend's ear and what it is, is he's like, oh, fuck, look at this fucking guy. So he's going to whisper in her ear something like, you know, steroids. Look at all the steroids that guy takes or-- or this guy has a small dick, you know, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, well, don't tell her that because then she's going to go and look at my dick and see that it's not small and now you're really fucked because not only are you fucking skinny and you have no muscles, you know, what I'm saying? It's to have that-- that power of just walking through the mall and just like fucking destroying someone emotionally, you know, and causing that much, you know, from a person just looking up and seeing you that they have to go say something to their girlfriend and, you know, and, you know, make themselves feel better. And it's like wow, you know, I'm just walking through the mall. A lot of people don't understand that, you know, I could disable the comments on my YouTube, you know. I hit one button and people can't comment, so I don't have to have any hate comments on my YouTube channel. But those hate comments, they help my YouTube channel. If I have eight-thousand hate comments on my YouTube channel, those comments all make my video go viral. And what it shows is the interest that people have in my video. So, comments are even more important than views because people are not only watching it, they fucking have to talk about this shit. So that's-- that's huge. So when YouTube sees that, when their computers see that, they put the video out more to make it go more viral. So they're helping the video go viral. So the haters are helping you, you know, make a video viral. You know, so the comments help extremely. So I fucking-- I love the haters. I welcome the haters. Keep hating and keep commenting. It's making me money. So you're on your way to get big, right? You're on your way to get big. I'm on my way to get small. -I'm going to-- -You're fucking-- you're going to be big and yoked that I'm going to be fucking skinny and a fucking fighter. I want to get my shoulders. So we're basically going to switch-- switch places. I'm going to get my shoulder surgery done here pretty soon. -Shoulder surgery? -Once I get that done, then I'll lay low for a minute, rehab it. My body is-- obviously my body wants to be big, so I'm trying to bring that shit down to like two-forty. So we're going to basically switch places. You'd be the bodybuilder, I'll be the fucking fighter. It'll be fucked up. What's up? -What's up? All right. -What's up, brother? How are you doing? -Yeah, I'm good man. I'm good. -I'm good. So what'd you bring for us today? A shitload of fucking ammo. Goddamn. Are we going to war? I was unaware. [man] You know what, you might-- you never know. You got a gun range, you never know what might happen. [Rich] Jesus Christ. I've never seen so much fucking ammo. This is crazy. -Yeah, well, you got to be prepared. -Right. With the zombies coming. So did you bring that-- that assault rifle we were talking about? -Yeah, actually this is it right here. -Oh, oh. I shot it a little bit, you know, I've shot that a couple times but, you know, I'm not just let loose with it. So, yeah, I did bring it. -Fuck, yeah. -I don't know if that's your favorite. Fuck yeah. And then I brought two other ones for you just in case you might want to have a little bit of change, you can-- And you brought the other rifle we shot last time? -Yeah, actually-- -Because last time we were shooting-- -The compact one? -I think so. That's the one. This is-- -Yeah, this is the one from-- -Perfect. -From before so-- -Okay, cool. See, the only difference is that one is wood stock and that one has a scope on it-- -Yeah. -And this is a lot shorter, so. Right. -And lighter, right? -Way lighter. Yeah. Sick. I've accomplished a lot of things in all different areas and it's important-- for me, it's important for people to know that I did it all on my own, you know, everything I did. You know, when I started the supplement line, it was my money that I invested that started. There was no silent partner. There's no-- there's no one else involved. It's a hundred percent me. And a lot of people, you know, don't know that. And when it came to everything, when I started buying my first real estate properties, it was me, you know. I mean I saved up the money, you know, for the down payment. I-- you know, it was-- I'm the one that did the research, I'm the one that, you know, read the books and got the knowledge of, you know, rental incomes and, you know, everything I've done. When I was day trading stocks, you know, I-- I learned how to do it on my own and I created my own system for day trading and followed it, you know. And it was all me and my-- on my own, you know. And so it's definitely-- is-- for me it means a lot to know that I did this stuff on my own. What's up? What's going on? What's happening? -What's up, brother? How you doing? -Good. -What's up my man? How are you doing? -I'm good. -Brought everyone, huh. -Yeah. What's up, little boy? What's up, my man? -Say high-five. High-five. -How are you doing buddy? -Ha! At least I got a smile. -Yes. -Say high-five. -That's even better than a high-five. -Say high-five. High-five. -Right on, brother. -All right. -Yeah. -He's just pushing the hand away. -Yeah. Nice kind of high-five. -What's up big boy? -How are you doing? How are you doing, man? Good. -Hey, how are you doing? Congratulations on everything. -Thank you. Look, we're going to load the cart up with the guns. So maybe if you-- I mean, if you want to park like here, here; so we just put the cart here and we just fucking load it up and then we roll. -What do you think? -So you are going to take everything right off? No, just the pistols. Oh, you got them all? Oh, fuck. Okay. Then never mind. Never mind. -I stuck them all on that-- -[Rich laughs] I guess-- I guess there's not that much to carry when it's the pistols. And so let's grab your shit, I guess. -It's in that. -Oh, it's all there? -I put in the back. -Well, fuck. -[man] You're the one that's running behind. -Goddamn. -[man] We are totally prepared. -I guess so. It's like we're going to war on this shit. Look at this. You got to-- you got to go up there in the front. Balance, counter-balance. Let's go and do wheel stand-- [Rich] Yeah, you're the-- you're the heaviest one here now. I'm the fucking lightweight. -How much you weigh now? -I'm like a-- I'm a little lightweight. I'm two-- two-seventy even. I actually dipped to two-sixty-nine. Damn. All right, let's do this. Let's get the fuck out of here. You guys good? [man] Here's a whole lot of meat in this cart. -Okay guys, tell me when-- -[Rich] I'm ready to roll. -Yeah. -All right. -[Rich] Are they barbecuing or what? What's the smoke? -[man] Yeah, they cook. -[Rich] Oh, they cook food? Right on! -[man] Yeah. I come all the time but I never come on weekends for this reason. So I've never seen it this busy. Yeah. -I feel like anywhere in LA it's busy weekends. -Yeah. So-- So what are you looking forward to shooting today? -What? -What are you looking forward to shooting today? I've shot everything that we have. -Oh, really? -Yeah. That's cool. -All good? -All good, brother. -Yep, thank you so much. -No problem at all. So, I guess we just buy our day passes and-- Oh, so let me see, how many people do we got all together? We got one-- who's all-- who's all shooting? One, two, three-- wait, one, two, three, four, five. You're shooting, right? Six. I don't need to shoot; doesn't matter. Five. You're shooting? Yeah, so six. -I'm sorry. -No, you guys are good. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Three, four, five, six. Okay, so seven people shooting. -Okay, so I have to shoot if all the other girls are shooting. -So then eight people shooting. [shots fired] Ready? Goddamn. First motherfucking shot of the day. Blew that fucking bottle. How much you want to fucking sell this gun for? -[man] I told you you'd like that. -Goddamn. That felt good. Jesus. Okay. I'm just going to go home. I-- I'm done for the day. [rock music] -[man] You must be Rich. -[Rich] Hey, what's up? How are you doing buddy? [man] Welcome to the center. Good to meet you. You guys took all my goddamn blood. I'm feeling a little weak. Yeah, that's-- that's the best way to get things started, you know-- -Yeah. -As, you know. -So you got referred here for-- for hormones and-- -Yes. --and goals of just IGF-1. IGF-1. So, you're in here. -I wasn't misled, was I? -No, no. We-- we do utilize IGF-1, which is great. And so I can kind of explain to you how-- [Rich] The thing is, is I can't really say I'm for steroids, but I'm not really against steroids, you know. It's a personal choice. And steroids are now being used a lot in longevity. You know, they are a lot more common now and doctors are prescribing them now. So people are realizing that they are very beneficial. I was recently up to three-fifteen. Now I'm on my way down just kind of trying to stay healthy but, you know, I still always going to be a bodybuilder at heart. I always want to have the muscle. I always want to have the mass. But I feel like I need to find a little bit healthier, you know, and I've heard-- I've actually tried IGF-1, you know, back maybe ten, twelve years ago. And, you know, I-- I thought it was incredible. That's what I thought. And so I've never been able to find it. Everything's fake, every single peptide company out there. You know, when I was told about you guys, I was like, you know, -fake, you know, just because it doesn't exist. -Right. And-- and so if it does exist, you know, it's something I've always wanted to try again. And I feel like I could take-- I feel like it could help me in many ways and also I have to lower my anabolic use. I think they're becoming more, you know, known and more acceptable and, you know, people are starting to understand what they really are, you know. And, you know, testosterone is something we have naturally in our body. So, you know, we're putting more of what we already naturally have. You know, it's not like, you know, if-- if someone is, you know, doing a recreational drug, that's something your body is-- is-- doesn't have, not used to. You know, testosterone is something our body-- we're born with testosterone. It's something that we need, you know. So we're putting more of something we already have in our body, you know. So just knowing that information makes it a little more-- you know, make a little bit more sense that it's not as bad as, you know, people wanted to-- want to believe. So it's a-- and you know, an IGF-1 has been something great because we do not-- we do not prescribe growth hormone and-- at all and so we use IGF-1, which is-- it is a-- it's legal and it's created by a company that we are all happy to-- to get into our clinics because the doctors that are prescribing it are-- are-- are getting the same results that back when you used it that you had. And it works tremendous for helping with building muscle, but it also helps with reducing inflammation and balancing your insulin response, sense of well-being. So, you know, we use it for everything from age managements to-- to performance. [Rich] In my opinion, if you do choose to go down that road, you need to wait as long as you possibly can. Get as much as you can naturally. There are physiques out there that are built on drugs and there's physiques that aren't built on drugs. And an example is, you know, you see a huge bodybuilder that's three-hundred pounds and he gets off the steroids and he shrinks back down to one-eighty. I don't believe he ever built a true foundation naturally, you know. He started taking steroids when he was one eighty and, you know, so from one eighty to three-hundred, it was all steroids. My opinion is he should have went from one eighty to maybe two-thirty, two-forty naturally and when he got to a point where he plateaued and he just could not get any bigger, now add the steroids in. All right, so what's my next step? Next step is as soon as the lab's in, we'll get back together and, yeah, and I think that-- I think that you're going to find that we can put a pretty complementary program where you can just start achieving what you want, which is-- so, you know, basically realizing that as you age, you just have to change and treat the body a little bit differently. But, you know, we'll-- we're going to keep you humming. Yeah, that's awesome. You know, and it's like the day they start the gym is the day they start the steroids. And it's almost like they go hand in hand and it really is out of control. And, you know, the biggest problem is people don't understand that your body gets used to whatever you're doing. You know, if you drink four cups of coffee every day, your body will get used to that four cups after a while and it will no longer give you what you're looking for. And it's the same with steroids. So if you take-- you know, if you're taking steroids and you continue to take them becomes a point where they no longer work and you're just taking them. And all you're doing is destroying your body and causing damage and you're not getting any benefits. -Hundred percent. -Hundred percent legit. Yeah. That's right. -I'll know when I do that first set. -That's right. So yeah, so let's plan on getting together here in a few days and we'll go from there. -Okay, awesome. -All right. -Thank you, sir. Right on. -Yeah, nice meeting you. You know, the crazy thing is my marketing is YouTube and Instagram. Well, so I'm getting paid to market, you know. The most important aspect of a company is the marketing. So this is the break room. And I figured I'd come in here and take a fucking break because I'm exhausted. So, I got my All Day You May Sweet Tea. I already had lunch, but I probably should eat again. But pretty fucking big break room. Now we're entering into the warehouse. And as you can see, it's pretty fucking huge. I believe all together it's about eighty-thousand square feet, the entire building. Basically products, shitload of products. And as you can see, we have plenty of room to have more products. Kill It Fruit Punch, Blue Raspberry, more Blue Raspberry, more Blue Raspberry, more Blue Raspberry. Full as F-ck Wildberry and the Real Food sweet potatoes. This is what I need delivered to my house. I'm on my last fucking bucket of it. And the shit was out of stock for a while. But as you can see, let me see how many pallets do we have of this shit. Obviously we have at least-- at least twenty-- at least twenty or thirty pallets of Real Food. So I think we're good. We won't be running out of it any time soon and the Rice will be coming out soon. Any fucking day now, the fucking chocolate rice, unbelievable. That shit is so good. And over here we have our shipping and receiving and of course, you know, we got to have a fucking basketball fucking hoop, right. -What's up, brother? -Hey, brother. -How are you doing? -I'm good, man. -What we got here? -Shipping some pallets for sport-- Right on. Yes, sir. Knocking them out today. Right on. [Rich] And marketing is the most important aspect of a company failing or, you know, doing good or not doing good. And, you know, having the followers and the subscribers I have and the views I get, you know, my company is doing incredible and I'm actually getting paid, you know. So that-- that just blows me away when I think about that that I'm getting paid to advertise my product, you know. And then I see other companies that are not taking advantage of this. You know, they have no YouTube channel, they have no videos. And then I see that they're-- they're placing ads in magazines, you know, for forty-thousand dollars, and that ad, you know, they're-- they're reaching-- they're reaching like thirty to fifty thousand people in that ad and they're paying thirty-thousand dollars for three months. And I can put one video up and-- and it reach millions of people and they're paying me ten thousand dollars to fucking put the ad up, you know. And the whole reason I started YouTube was marketing, it wasn't about money, you know. I wasn't doing YouTube-- I never did YouTube to make money, that was never my plan. It was all about I need to start a YouTube channel to market my products, you know, and that's-- it's a great way to market. And that's what it was. And then when the money started coming, I'm like, Jesus Christ. Up fucking stairs. I don't ever come up here, so, shit I think I've been up here twice in my life. What's up, brother? Here you go. My color clothes. What's up, my man? -How is it going? -How you doing brother? -Doing all right. -Awesome. -All right, I got to grab one each of these. -They are all yours. Let me get-- let me just get-- let me get this, that-- that one you have in your hand, this one, this one and this one. [Rich] I got to be honest with you, I get fucking lost in this motherfucker and I'm still getting lost. But as you can see, we got a shitload of product. I'm not going to be running out of product. That was the problem in the beginning, we couldn't keep up with the demand. You know, we had more people wanting the shit than we could fucking make, which I would say I guess it's a problem but it's not a big problem, it's a good problem, right? [man] You good? I'm skinny right now. So much weight I lost. I lost fifty pounds. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Serious? -Yeah. -Good morning. -What's up, buddy? How are you doing? I'm just going to come here more often. [Rich] I am not a pro. I'm not competing. Yet, I have a bigger fan base and I have more, you know, followers, more-- you know, more people wanting to take a picture with me. So I thought it was going to be a huge problem and it actually hasn't been. It's been really great. Everyone's treating me, you know, wonderful and, you know, the top guys came up to me and they're like, hey, you know, it's great to meet you, you know, I watch your videos and this and that. I was just like, wow, you know. And, you know, it was even-- it was funny because there was this one situation where one of the top guys in the Olympia, top guys in Olympia, was waiting for an elevator. So I walk up and he says, hey, Rich. Hey man, I'm a fan of yours. I watch your videos. You know, it's great to meet you and blah, blah, blah. And I say to him, I say-- I said, oh, you know, thank you, great to meet you. I said, you know, what's your name? Okay, it was a top fucking bodybuilder, you know, and here I'm asking him what his name is. -[woman] Hi. -[woman] Hi. How are you doing? How are you guys doing? Right on, brother. Right on. What's up, brother? How are you guys doing? Hi. -Coming to booths? -Yeah. Right on, man. All right ,guys. Right on. Right on. What's up? What's up? What's up? -How are you doing, brother? -Good. The young C. T. Fletcher over here. Cheers, brother. [Rich] You know, I-- I sit and I make sure that I shake everybody's hand, I take a picture with everyone. I don't leave early. I don't take breaks. You know, I will stay till the end. You know, if the expo ends at five and there's a line, I will stay until that line is done, you know. If it's at eight o'clock, I'll still be there, you know, I won't just, you know, walk off and leave my fans hanging, you know. And so a lot of people that I have met me or know me, you know, they realize it. There really is no way you could fucking hate me as a person. [laughing] I mean, if you get to know me, it's an impossibility, you know. Visually, you know, it's a jealous thing and-- -Hey how are you doing? I haven't seen you in forever. -I know. Good to see you guys. [Rich] It's crazy because a lot of times when I take pictures with people, you know, like you see other people taking pictures with celebrities and you can tell by the picture that it's-- it's a celebrity taken picture. Like, hey, can I get a picture with you, and they take a picture, you know. But I-- I think that having a picture that's more of, you know, a real picture, it looks like, you know, we're just hanging out together, we're shooting the shit, we're-- you know, it's not necessarily we just met and we're getting a picture, like, we could be friends. You know, I think that is a much better picture. And I don't take breaks. So if-- if I'm at an expo from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., I don't take a half an hour break and go eat, you know. I sit there the entire-- or stand there the entire time and I eat while I'm greeting the fans. And it's just the work ethic I have. And every single athlete at those booths, you know, are-- are doing what I'm doing and they're so like my competition. And I-- I always want to be better than everyone else and I want to be the best I can be. So, you know, I will stand there the entire time, I will stay there after the expo closes and I'll be the only one in the building still taking pictures with people, you know, and I'll be the only one that doesn't take a break. And I feel like this is what's going to put me above everyone, you know, is-- is-- is working harder, you know, and being better. And so that's what I pride myself on. And, you know, anything I do, that's what I try to, you know, just be better than everyone else. What I feel now is I've helped a lot of people. People come to me all the time and tell me how much I've helped them, how I changed their life. And for me, it's truly amazing that the videos I put out, people can say I changed their life. You know, there's people that told me that they were in a hotel, they gave up on life and they were just there doing drugs and they turned on my video, they started watching my videos and it ended up turning their life around. And to me that's just amazing because I don't do the videos with that in mind, you know. I'm not trying to turn people's lives around. I'm just trying to give little bits of information to help people, you know, and educate people and motivate people. So to hear that kind of stuff is crazy, you know. So I guess, you know, continue doing what I'm doing and possibly, you know, on-- on a larger scale, you know, continuing to help people, change people's lives and so, yeah. Right on! [man] Rich. Rich. Just a photo. That's marked in already. [photographer] Okay, what do we do-- One more, hold on. -It's great. Thank you so much. -All right! Martin, it's not your turn yet! I'm still the highlight. So you're taking all my-- whatever I have. [photographer] Same here, same here. -Thank you. -All right, I got to get out of here. Martin's making me look bad in his-- in his incredible suit. -And I'm in a t-shirt. -[Rich] And look at this! Kai now is really making me look bad. [photographer] Wait a minute, wait a minute. Grab some right-- Is everybody in the building feeling great today? You had a good time at the show? [crowd cheering] Yeah! You're just really quiet coming here. Weren't you a bit noisy? I was pretty noisy coming here, I think. I got the crowd riled up a little bit. I tried. -I think Brian did that before you open up? -Yeah. She-- she outdid me, I admit it. I think I would like to see this movie really hit the general public and get the general public involved and know a little bit more about bodybuilding and our lifestyles and what we go through and how hard it really is what a lot of us do. I no longer compete. I'm not-- I don't consider myself an athlete any longer. But a lot of people up here are incredible athletes sitting right here next to me. And I think letting the general public know, you know, exactly more about what we do and getting more involved and possibly, you know, I think bodybuilding is something we've always wanted to be a main sport like basketball, football and it never has. It's always been kind of a cult. And I think this movie possibly could get, you know, make the sport grow, you know, get more people involved and interested and a bigger fan base, you know, for the sport itself and possibly help the sport grow. Nothing has ever been able to do that. Generation Iron, the first one, you know, the hopes were that possibly that could happen and it didn't really hit right. But I think this film can do that and that's what I'd like to see happening.
