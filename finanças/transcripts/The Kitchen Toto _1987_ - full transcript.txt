[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BELL RINGING] [DOG BARKING] [DOG BARKING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Eh? KAMAU: Open. Who is it? It is Kamau. MZEE: What is it, Kamau? I want to talk to you. [ANIMAL SCREECHING] If you must speak at this time, then you come in. No. There are no private matters between me and my family. Mzee Moses, we are asking you to help us. Just a small thing. We want you to speak in your church. The Europeans have our best land and we still scratch about in the dust. [KAMAU SPEAKING KIKUYU] [MZEE INTERRUPTS IN KIKUYU] Your methods are all wrong. And you're crazy coming here. If you think I'm going to tell my congregation to take your Thenge Oath... MAN: Today is not like the old days. Get out. But think about it, old man. [DOOR CLOSING] [COW MOOING] [ROOSTER CROWING] [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] MZEE: Sometimes I think what would happen if Jesus was born again. Just a little Kikuyu baby. Would we recognize him? What would baby Jesus think of the world we live in? But still we carry on telling ourselves there is nothing wrong. We think that so long as we come here on Sunday, and Christmas Day, wickedness will go away. Well, I tell you it won't. We must stand up together and speak out against wickedness. Yes, because it is right here in our midst. Yes, some of you know that I'm talking about the Thenge Oath. My feelings, I hope, are clear. Christ has shown us the only path! I beg that if anyone of you has taken one of these oaths to step forward and renounce it in the name of Jesus. [MAN SPEAKING KIKUYU] [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR SLAMMING] Very well. Let us pray. Almighty God, father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, who desireth not the death of a sinner. [DOG BARKING] [CHATTERING IN SWAHILI] What is it?

Take him away. [BABY CRYING] Effendi! She is not dead. Better stop that bleeding, then. John. Sir. Take them to the Mission Hospital. [STEPHEN SPEAKING KIKUYU] Should've brought the tracker dogs. Shall I fetch them, Effendi? No, it'll be too late by then. They'll be across half a dozen rivers. Who would do this, Stephen? They are superstitious people, Effendi. Superstitious? Very superstitious. I think there's more to this than walking under ladders. Effendi? It doesn't matter. Could be Mzee Moses wanted to stop their practices. Their Thenge is very strong with them. Effendi! There are other totos in the forest. Okay, take an askari, go find them. You think it's the Thenge Oath? I am like yourself, BwanaJohn. We are not Kikuyu, so we can't know how strong it is with them. JOHN: What's your name? Mwangi Moses Kariuki. [BUGLE SOUNDING] You do speak English, Mwangi? I want you to tell me everything that happened. All that you can remember. Tell him. Tell him everything. What time was it when they came to the hut? Still dark? Did you recognize them? STEPHEN: Did you see them? JOHN: Do you know their names? We're here to help, you know. Did you recognize any of the men or know their names? All right, Mwangi. You've done well. Okay. [BABIES CRYING] SISTER: Dear, dear. [IRISH ACCENT] Mwangi, Mary, Peter and Paul. Am I right? Your mum is going to be just fine. JOHN: Is that you, sister? MAMA: May I come in? [DOGS BARKING] May I come in? EDWARD: Bad dog! Come here! EDWARD: [IN SWAHILI] What do you want? MAMA: I want Mr. John. Well, he's at the police station. Go and wait behind the kitchen. Thank you, small John. Remove this dog from here. Mutusgo around the back! Okay, you white child. MAMA: [IN KIKUYU] Please, try hard for us to get a job for Mwangi. I do understand, I'll try his trifle. He's coming now. Please, try hard for us to get a job for this boy I do understand. And I am going to try very hard to get a job for Mwangi. [CAR APPROACHING] [CAR DOOR CLOSING] Mrs. Kariuki, you shouldn't. No, please take it. Take it. Well, it's very kind of you. The memsahib will be delighted. Thank you. Thank you too much. Mugo. Look what Mrs. Kariuki's brought. [SPEAKING APPRECIATIVELY IN KIKUYU] First class. Thank you too much. Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Kariuki. Bwana? One thing, please, to help with. Yes? Bwana,you know it's not easy at the farm without Mzee. So many small totos to feed. Bwana,is it possible you will find employment for my first born? Mrs. Kariuki, he's rather young. Shouldn't he be at school? Oh, he's already completed his schooling. He is of good age now. But I don't know what work he would do. He can do anything! Even... He is circumcised, he's a bright fellow. Mugo, haven't we got all the staff we need? Well, he could make a good kitchen toto. Oh, that is what I was thinking all the time. He would make an expert kitchen toto. Isn't that what I was saying, Mwangi? I'll be your best kitchen toto. You can't refuse, he is number one. [CHUCKLES] Mrs. Kariuki, you should run an employment agency. Mugo, take Mwangi into the kitchen. Oh, thank you, Bwana. No, no, please. Look, I can't promise anything. I'll have to talk it over with the memsahib. But leave him here for the moment and we'll see how things work out. Oh, thank you. May God keep you in a good corner. Mugo, will you look after him and make sure he works well? MUGO: Yes, I understand. Understand? Yes, I understand. Mwangi, do your work properly and don't cry. Do you understand? Yes. [MWANGI SNIFFLING] [WARIMU SINGING IN KIKUYU] [EXCLAIMS IN SWAHILI] Buck up! I remember you mix everything all the time. Korogathis more! It needs more salt. One of yours, Mugo? Mine, Memsahib?No. He is a kitchen boy. JANET: Kitchen toto? For you, special, Memsahib. Jolly generous, but I don't think so. Mr. John knows. I've just been informed by Mugo that we have a new kitchen toto. Yes, he seemed to think it would be a good idea. So Mugo runs the house? All right, I thought it would be a good idea. We don't need anybody. You might not, but he does. Damn it, he'll only be getting 12 bob a month. It would be nice to have a little say before one's landed with servants. Come off it, Janet, he's Mzee's boy. What do you mean, "Come off it"? [SCOFFS] I'm not running an orphanage. [PARROT WHISTLING] I think the atmosphere around here would be a lot better if you got rid of that parrot for a start. Now those. But, Memsahib, they are not bad after washing. Mugo! Here, use this. Now all over. Yes, Memsahib. There you are. That's from the last little disaster. It'll need taking up at the bottom. Yes, Memsahib. And no shoes in the house. Yes, Memsahib. Come along, Edward. What are you gawping at? [DOGS BARKING] [LAUGHING] Even your mother won't recognize you. You are their kitchen totonow. What does it matter? You know who you are.
