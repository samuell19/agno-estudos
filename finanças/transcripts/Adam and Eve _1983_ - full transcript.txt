Adamo ed Eva Enough. Eve. Why not taste the loveliest fruit in Paradise? It's an apple.. Try it.. No! Don't touch it. - Why not? - It's forbidden. Here. This is more beautiful. Don't listen to him. But I'm hungry. You can't eat the fruit of this tree. Eat this. The apple is better. That's why it is forbidden. Don't listen to him. - Come on. - Don't go. The apple is red, sweet. Tasty. Eve. Follow me. Come and eat the apple. Adam, I can't see you. What are you waiting for? Taste the forbidden fruit. Take it. You'll like it. Make up your mind The forbidden fruit. Who by? How do you know? If it's forbidden why do you keep telling me to eat it? Leave me alone. I was only looking. Can't I even look at the forbidden fruit? Answer me. Is it forbidden to look at it? Answer me. - No. - Then I'll look. If you eat it... your life will change. Enough is enough. Let's go. Where to? To take another bath? To look at another sunset? - And after? - After what? I don't understand. I don't know what to say. All the days are the same here. Nothing ever happens. - What should happen? - I don't know... But... Something different, more exciting. - Don't you agree? - Why, I'm fine as I am. Well I'm not. Eve. Don't eat it. It's only an apple. No, don't eat it. Try it, it's sweet. If you eat it... your life will change. What's happening? I don't know. Help! I'm coming. Help. Give me your hand. Nearly. That's it. Don't stop. What is it? Quick Come on! Run! Jump! Are you alright? Where d'you think we are? How will we get out? Answer me! Follow me! Wait! Don't look at me. I said don't look at me. There's nothing left. Nothing. I'm tired. When can we stop? I don't know. Let's stop. I'm cold. - Why doesn't the sun warm us? - We're lost. It's your fault we don't feel its heat any more. Without the sun there'll be no more trees, food. We'll find no more fruit. It would be better for you if we found no more fruit. Come on now. We must find a shelter for the night, or we'll die. Why? Aren't we already dead? This is not death. - This a punishment. - Punishment? Then it will finish, and we can return back there. I swear I'll be good and obedient as you want. Don't go. Stop! Wait for me. Wait for me! Stop being so angry. Wait for me! Look here. Look what I've found. Look out! Come and eat. We can't. The animals do. What is it? - There's someone there. - Where There, behind the rocks. - It's probably an animal. - It wasn't an animal. - What do you want it to be? - It was a man. - What are you saying? - I tell you it wasn't an animal. There's only us here. Let's go. So it was only us. Where did they come from? I told you there was someone. - Try to escape. - Where too? There's so many. Try to, anyway. Go! What are you looking at? They're coming closer. What do you want? They don't understand us. Do something. I don't want them touching me. Leave me alone. Don't touch me. - How are you? - Can't you see? I told you to escape. All you do is criticize. That's really charming. I love you. Finally, but does this seem the right time? I'm ready to forgive everything. To die for you, or live with you forever. How? Together? For ever? And who gives the orders? Who do you want? Me naturally. I think they want to eat us? Perhaps it's not as bad as we imagine. Stop touching me. Take your hand off me! They want to kill me. They only want to see how you are made. No. Now they are afraid of us. Let's go. I want to stop. - We need to reach the sea. - Why the sea? Because life begins in the sea and we have to start afresh. Perhaps the sea's not here. Perhaps it only exists up there. Did you hear what I said Aren't you listening? - No, what did you say? - You haven't heard a word... I said there's no sea here. - It doesn't exist. - It must exist. Look. Look. The birds will take us to the sea.. - How do you know? - I just know. Like there's no more sun, the uninhabited earth. So where do you want to go? Somewhere nice. And tranquil. Not too hot, nor too cold. Where there are trees. And fruit to eat. And the animals are good. - We were there, but because of you... - Again? - You said you'd forgiven me. - I have forgiven you. But I've never forgiven myself for allowing myself to follow you. I was wrong. Now it's you who must follow me. As for me, I'm not going. Look, more birds going in the same direction. Towards the forest, towards the desert. Maybe but beyond that... We will find the sea. There are trees that way. And we must shelter from the sun. This is the way we must take. The sea is there. You're stubborn as usual. Go if you want. I'm staying here. Where are you going? Come back! I want to see if I can discover something from here. Where are you? Come down this instant. You'll hurt yourself. Follow your birds. I'm not budging. If you don't come down immediately, I'm leaving. - I can manage without you. - We'll see. I'm going. Let me go. Who are you? What do you want with me? Put me down. Don't touch me. No! Help me. Green man. At last. Water. Now I get rid of this horrible green stuff. Why don't you wash too? Look, the water washes it off. Do like me. And after you'll be more handsome. Come on. Splash yourself. That's it. Let me go! Don't touch her. I said, don't touch her. No! Let me go. You're tired. You're angry. I'm happy. So happy. Because now I know you love me. You came back for me. You fought for me. You've been wonderful. And what have you been doing, all this time? Doing? I realize that I love you. Who made you understand? This other? He means nothing. Nothing at all. Is it for me, that club? Perhaps. I have to learn to use it. You saw how he killed the bear? I want to be with you, - but also with others. - The others? I saw them together. They help and defend each other. When I saw you with the other I felt bad. - How bad? - I don't know. Bad inside. - Jealous? - Yes. I wanted you to die.. Then instead, I came to your rescue. What's the matter? It's nothing. I'll be alright. Do you want to go? What are you doing? - I'm preparing a club. - Another? Yes, I lost it. This one's even better. What are you doing? - I'm making a cub. - A cub? - Like the animals? - Yes, like the animals. It's not possible. Why won't you believe me? Come on woman, it's getting late. Too bad for you if you don't believe me. Goodbye! Oh no, not again. Where do you think you're going? Come back. I refuse to go with you again. unless you stop treating me like your club. What did you say? Come back here. Just for once I want to prove that I can do something alone. - I can't understand what you want. - It's pointless us being together. Be careful where you walk. You might fall. I can look where I'm doing. I told you. It's all your fault. I'm cold and I'm tired, and I'm having a cub. - What kind of cub? - A cub that looks like you. - Like me? - Or me. Really? A cub like me? Wake up. Come. But where? Come. - I've found a passage. - What passage? We should emerge on the other side of the mountain. Perhaps this time we'll find the sea. Where are we? - What shall we do? - I don't know Go away. It's over. Calm down, it's over. Is this your sea? I can't go on any more. I can't take any more. You have to get up. We must build a shelter. Come on. I didn't find anything. But I'm hungry. You don't understand how hungry? We must have faith. We can't give up now, after all that's happened. But what faith? It's finished. You mustn't give up. You were right. We mustn't stop. We must go on. Come, get up. Come. - We must stop here. - Why? I can't say why. I feel that our journey is over. - And the sea? - The sea is here. Below us. We just need to wait. The cold will end, and the ice will melt. - But how will we survive? - I don't know. But something will happen. We must have faith. Do you feel bad? - Yes. - Unfortunately you have to suffer. But why? - Because you must. - But I don't want to. - We need to reach the sea. - Why the sea? Because life begins in the sea and we have to start afresh. Subtitles: by rarelust
