What happened? Did you get dirty? -No, that's the color of my hands. It1l rub off soon. You have to scrub it with laundry soap. Do you have a bar of laundry soap at home? There.

That's what you asked? And what did he say? -He said: Sure. Why not? And you meant it? Are you really going to go out with him? -Why not? You said he looks like a geek. That he dresses like a boy scout. Wow. Look at that dress. Letsgoinatryiton. He really does dress like a boy scout. -You must be deranged. Totally off your rocker. First, you spend two years with a guy who knows the difference between Beaujolais and Saumignon. Sauvignon, not Saumignon. He'd put you in jail for a mistake like that. Besides, the bastard is getting married. “What? This, for example, is a dress that would look good on Hagit Degani. Hagit who? -Hagit Degani, daughter of the famous Baruch Degani. After the wedding, she'll probably call herself Degani--Strassburg. That disgusting yuppie. She can wear anything she wants. You know why? She’s 22. Her entire body is young and supple. After | put up with him for two years he goes and marries her. 2 yards for 10 shekels. Go for it! 2 yards for 10 shekels. Believe me. You get a thick one for the price of a thin one. Go for it.

He says it's because of the ultimatum or the uncertainty. | can't remember which. He covered the whole house in nylon wrap. Do you know how many cans of food we have at home? Do you know how hard it is to drag all those cans home from the market? Believe me. My back is killing me. He gave us a lecture on nerve gas. Mustard gas. Believe me. He's worse than Mom. -How long has he known her? Two days? Why's he marrying her? When he was with me, he didn't want to get married so quickly. Take this, darling. “Don't cry, girl. Don't cry.

Hi. “Well, you gave me your phone number. Right. -So | thought maybe we could get together. -We could. It's just that | have reserves duty starting tomorrow. Really? Are you going to bomb Iraq? No, I'm going to the equipment base. -Oh. Any chance you like schnitzel? -Yes. -Are you hungry? -Hungry? Yes. Do you know where Mazkeret Batya is? -Of course. Makeret Batya, damn it! Where is Mazkeret Batya?! Mazkeret Batya! Mazkeret Batya! Mazkeret Batya! What a sweet sign. Down to the end and left... Right after the orchard... Third house on the left... | heard the car. -1 brought us beers. Do you want me to take your coat? Aren't you cold like that? -Cold? Of course it's cold, but it's sexy. It's not sexy? -“You have lipstick on your teeth. " What? You have lipstick on your teeth. -Where, here? -Yes. There. -Here too? There, too. -Shut up, idiot. My schnitzel is burning. My mother first dips them in bread crumbs and then in egg. I've never heard of anyone who does it that way. Tell her you met a food engineer and he told you it's not right. As if that would help. My mother also says that on January 15, Sadaam is going to attack us with an atomic bomb. And what do you think about that? -About what? About the war? I don't think about it. Can you imagine missiles on Tel Aviv? I'll have parking by my house before missiles fall around here. It's pretty ridiculous. Wow, it's been years since |'ve eaten Jello! I wanted to make something else, but I didn't have time. And you just happened to have Jello in the house? You're unbelievable. It's idiotic, but it tastes good. When you were little, did mix your Jello? No, just ice-cream. -Me, too. Did you used to lick chocolate? You're strange. What kind of questions are you asking? Excellent questions. What do you want me to ask? About school? The army? | only ask questions that interest me. Have you ever been married? -No. Stop it. “No. Stop it.” Answer already. Have you ever been married? No. | told you. -Do you have kids? -No. If you had kids, what would you name them? Noah. Why did they call you Noah? -1 don't know. | never asked. That was pretty nice. You're pretty okay for a food engineer. It's not like I've ever been with a food engineer before you, but I don't think I ever thought it would be nice to try it with a food engineer, for a change. | thought a food engineer would be like an account, only with a apron. Do you work with an apron? -Sometimes. Are you married? -I said no. I'm just checking. Do you have any unrequited loves? Any broken heart that won't mend? Any legendary ex-girlfriend? Do you? How long is your reserves duty? -One week. -Will you call me from there? Do you want me to call? -Yes. Will you call? -Of course. If you want. | do. So call. -1l call. 1l call. Get in the house.

Where’s Marco? Havent you heard? He went to an advertiser's conference in Amsterdam. Of course. An advertiser's conference in Amsterdam. He's scared stiff.

Are you going to have lunch with him on Saturday? You know | am. So maybe you can find out what really happened? Mom, I'm not going to spy on Dad. It's not considered spying. It's just showing interest. Mom said that Hanna went abroad. -That's true. Her daughter is worried so she sent her a ticket. -She also said that you and Hanna broke up. | don't have control over that. What about you? Got a guy? Actually, | do. He's even nice. Would you believe it? -No kidding. Are you treating him well? I treat him super-well. Grandpa. -God help him. -Grandpa. -Hi. | think that Amos is upset. Amos, why are you upset? Maybe we should postpone this discussion. -Why? It's a great topic. It's not even a discussion. -Alona... Is something wrong? -Does something seem wrong to you? Come on. Tell me. -What happened? Amos cheated on me. -What? Do you remember that patient he had on New Year's Eve? There was no patient and no analysis. It was her, a second year psychology student. She was 22. Can you imagine?

The United States, along with the coalition, has begun "Operation Desert Storm,” battling in the Gulf.

Too bad | can't join you, but there are some issues with the conference. Ill try and call back later. - Are you crazy? I've been looking for you. Where have you been? | tried that Nahum of yours and he said you're on your way to Petah-Tikva. Well, you should have gotten here a long time ago. Call Dad the minute you hear this. We're here. Don't you know what time it is? If your mother is allowed to call me at this hour, then | can come here, too. My mother called you? -Are you going to let me in? Why did my mother call you? Your mother thinks that I'm a great guy. So tell me about life out in the wild? - Why not? You're not usually shy. You can tell me about Hagit Degani. Okay. Hagit Degani is in London and I don't think she's coming back. Missile-phobia? -Marrying Ofer phobia. She told me that living with me is like living in a cemetery and after being with me for a few minutes, she has to go warm up in the freezer. For some reason, my girlfriends become quite poetic when they dump me. Why dont | feel that you're heartbroken? Why don't you tell me something about that noble savage? We're jealous. -You talk to me about being jealous? When [ told you that I'm not getting married, your sigh of relief could be heard in Mazkeret Batya. Why arent you in Mazkeret Batya, anyway? "In times of tension, problems could arise between couples. “If a problem arises, don't make a big deal of it. Just say: "Let’s calm down first. Let's see.

Just shut up and come sit down next to Alona. She doesn't want to shut up. Everyone’s shutting up here. She wants to talk. -1t wouldnt hurt for you to watch your mouth, too. Does anyone want coffee? -Yes. -Pretending to be Mother Theresa as if she's not here to ruin Dad’s wedding. Alona, don't meddle with our lives and we won't meddle with yours. Okay? -Okay. -| suggest that everyone just calm down. This argument has no purpose. Excuse me. This is not a psychoanalysis clinic. We didn't come here for you to vomit Freud on all of us. Talila, cant you control yourself? You have no idea who Freud is. Stop using him a some sort of curse. Actually, you should just quiet down. - Don't talk to me about quiet. You're the one who said that quiet bothers you in life so you be quiet yourself. -Really? Decide. Should | be quiet or noisy? The children. The children. Great, Amos. Look what you've done. Is that how you act with your patients as well? Why don't you ask him how he acts with his patients? Do you really think this is a subject for a family discussion? Do you have to tell everyone everything? Is there anything else that your family doesn't know about me? Maybe you should bring someone else. Maybe put an ad in the newspaper. Amos, that's enough. Drop it. "This is the combined broadcast of the Voice of Israel and IDF radio.” With all the yelling, | forgot to tell you. Tomorrow, we're going to Jerusalem. To the Hilton. - The Hilton? Isn't that expensive? Yes, but another day with Mom and Dad, and I'll want to kill them, too. Will you come and visit? -Jerusalem? I'd rather get hit by a chemical bomb. What's that?

And the day after tomorrow, no. -20 shekels, please. Wow. -Please. Anat? -Today, yes. Tomorrow, yes. Two days from now, chemical. -No way. Such optimism. -Talila, you're alive. Where've you been? In Petah-Tikva, by my father. | read in the paper that this war is making people crazy, but Petah-Tikva? I don't get what's so funny. We could get killed at any moment and you're here betting on when the next rocket will fall? What's so funny about that? Has anyone noticed that the window isn't sealed properly. He's become such a worrywart. Excuse me? Excuse me? Excuse me! Do you have a rubber band? We're all patriots, you know. Thanks. -You're welcome. So are you on your way to Jerusalem? -No. -l am. My parents are at the Hilton. They're old and scared of the missiles. Great. So are you going to the airport? -Mazkeret Batya. Near Rehovot. Really? That's a nice place. Bye. Hello? Hello? Noah? Why are you sitting in the dark? | was waiting for you and it got dark. Sorry I'm late. | have to talk to you. That girl, Donna, the one who went to Boston to study, the one | told you about, she came to Israel to be with her parents. | met her today. -You met her? Why did you meet her? She came to the factory. She also said she talked to you on the phone. You forgot to tell me. -1 don't want to hear anymore. Give me 5 minutes and I'm out of here. What are you doing? -I'm leaving. -Leaving? Where are you going? You can't go now. Will you just stop for a minute and let me explain? No. I don't want you to explain anything. | know that I'm a fantastic girl, and that it's not my fault, and no one’s to blame, and I'm not the type of girl that guys marry... I've heard all that enough. I don't have to hear it from you. | just want you to let me pack and get out of here. At least sleep here tonight. - Don't touch me, please. I'm not planning on giving you a farewell fuck. "Rain, when it falls on time, "Brings so much sadness along. "Everything’s stopped, comes to a standstill. "Just the rain comes on time. It doesn't care "That the nights over there are very cold, "And that it's hard to cry in the sand dunes...” Stop it. That's enough. Stop it. Can you get me the Baor family, please? Hello? -Alona, it's me. I'm in the lobby. “What happened? I left Noah. - Come up. -Il can't face Amos and the kids right now. Okay. Il come down. Did you say yes? -Yes. -Was that a yes? -Yes. -I've been waiting... Hello. -What? -Hello. Remember me? Can | sit next to you? -Sit... My sister's supposed to join me. My sister's here and my parents, too. What floor is she on? -16. | think. -Mine are on the 11th. -What would you like, Miss? Mineral water, please. You know, it's really funny that | met you here. -Funny? -Yes. Because when | met you on the highway, you said you were going to Mazkeret Batya, and | have an ex-boyfriend in Mazkeret Batya, so after you said you were going there, | said: Well, maybe | should see what's happening with Noah. His name is Noah. | actually called him yesterday, but some girl answered the phone and she sounded like such a monster, so | said, "Well, | have nothing to lose.” | went to his factory. It was a short and strange meeting but now, | called him and suddenly, it seems that the girl left him, so | decided to go over there for the weekend to see what's what. Isnt that funny? -Hilarious. Talila? Talilo. -Your name is Talila? My name is Donna. Nice to meet you. We have to go. That's Donna, don't you understand? That's Noah's legendary ex. That boring mouse with her parents on the eleventh floor, with Sting playing in her ear straight into her heart. Who is that? -That bitch told me that she's going to Mazkeret Batya tomorrow to check out their relationship. Over my dead body. -Talila? Come on, Talila. This is insane, roaming around the parking lot now. You don't have a heart... Besides, it's illegal. It's a crime. I don't need to sit in jail now. Kids, look for a blue car. Which blue car? What are you talking about? Oh, Talila. -Yoavi, do you know what an Ibezia looks like? -Yes. You and Daffi go over there. If you see a blue Ibezia, let me know. Okay? You're with me. Give me a break, Talila. You want me to sit in jail with my kids now? Talila! | found it. Talila, are you crazy? You're going to cut the wheels in front of the children? That's not educational. It's also not educational to lose Noah to that vixen. Yoav, Daffi, go wait over there till Mom and Talila come. | don't want to. -Yoavit -Can you run fast? What are you doing? You're out of your mind. Look, kids. Look at the pretty bird! Talila, stop it. They'll arrest us. What are you doing? Talila, what are you doing? That's it. We're done. Are you going to faint? -Fair enough, Talila. You're amazing. It's important to protect yourselves. It's important be vigilant, and most important of all, try and go about your lives as usual in Israel. There are a few who have left us. | ask all of them to return so that they don't become defectors. Defectors or not, Tel Aviv residents contemplate the question: The sealed room or a bomb shelter? In a recent survey, it seems that 46% of the population does not have faith in the sealed room and prefer the bomb shelter. 54% still feel safe in a sealed room and continue to enter the room during a missile attack. Hilton, hello. -Hello. Alona Baor, please. The Baor family has gone out. Would you like to leave a message? Yes. That Talila called. -Thank you. Hello? -Yoni, hi. How are you? -Oh, I'm on my way out. Are you at home? --Yes. -So I'll call. - Yes, of course. Call later on. Bye. -Bye. Bye. "Hello. This is the Katz family. We can't answer the phone right now. "But please leave a message.” -Hello. This is your daughter. Do you go on a trip? Are you busy? Did a missile fall on you? Did you forget I'm alive? I'm at home. Hello? -Let me talk to Noah. -Who's calling? Open up! Let me in! Too bad there’s no mirror here. | heard you came back to Tel Aviv. What happened? The air in Mazkeret Batya was too clean for you? Can you walk or should | bring a crane? Do you know what we're going to do now? First of all, we're going to give you a bath in bleach, and then we'll go out on the town. "Viper!” (codeword for missile attack) "Viper!” All you chickens down to the bomb shelters! And now, all you chickens come out of the bomb shelters! Down to the shelters! Out of the shelters! Down! Out! "You can have everything. Today is tomorrow, just like yesterday. "We need a holiday. "You can have everything, but I'm not allowed to "Ask why? -But you can...” | have headache. -Okay. Where are you taking me? -To the couch. -I hate this couch. I'm going to replace it. -Any more complaints? | hate this war. -This war is not your problem. Your problem is that you don't live like you should. You think a new couch will make your life all right? Why not? My life is crap. At least, | should be able to sit comfortably. You should marry me. | suit you. | know it'll make you mad to hear, but it's the truth. We're a match. -1 don't want you to suit me. You're a magazine. I don't want to live with a magazine. I want to marry for love. Like that guy from Mazkeret Batya for example? -Yes. How long were you with him, 3 weeks, a month? We were together two years. We lived together. Isn't that worth something? Something? Something? That certainly counts for something. We lived together for 2 years, and all you did for those two years was to tell me what to wear and how to look and where to cut my hair, and how | talk and how much | curse, and what movies | should see, and what food | should like and that the music I listen to is stupid, and why it's vulgar to make noises when having sex and why people who drink instant coffee should be shunned, and |, like an idiot, took all those things seriously and two months after we break up, you already make plans to marry a 22-year-old, which reminds me that not now or during the 2 years we were together two whole years, you never told me that you love me. But it's obvious, isn't it? I'm sleeping. -Good morning, ma‘am. | brought the couch. That's it. I've had enough. I'm getting out of the house. Ever since you cut that hussy’s tires, | can't stop thinking how I'm such a wimp. | can't look at him. | can't talk to him. | can't even fight with him in front of the children. Oh, a little closer to the curtain. What's this supposed to be? It doesn't matter. Are you listening? Every evening, he comes home with stories of evacuees here and there, and what a trauma they've had and how he’s so lucky to have a home and how he’s so lucky to be alive at all and how he understands that his days are numbered and getting shorter. Let them get shorter. I'm sick of it. He keeps telling me that he understands me. That psychopath. Bastard. I'm going to Kfar Bloom. -To Michal and Benny? Are you nuts? You hate them. -Not as much as Amos. Heard anything from the country boy? -Nothing. Maybe you should visit him? You know, like: "Oh, | was just passing by.” Never. Well, Noah. | got a marriage proposal, but | decided that Il marry you, Noah, and we'll have 3 kids and wel'll call them Pullet, Chickadee, and Orchid. You heard the car. -What are you doing here? | wanted to see you, okay? | came to grovel, okay? I'm not sure that’s such a good idea. -It's actually an excellent idea. Talila, what are you doing here? | came to bring Noah some clothes. Noah? Why should you bring Noah clothes? What's this? ~-Maybe Talila will explain. I'm going to make coffee. How are you? Did you family leave the Hilton? -No. Why didn't you tell me you knew Noah? | didn't know you were talking about him. Are you going back to Boston? Don't you study there? How do you know all these things? How do you know Noah? Why did you buy him clothes? -1 should have bought you some, too. Isnt it nice that the 3 of us can sit here together and talk. Talila, stop it. -Stop what? I'm trying to be nice. -No you're not and you know it -At least I'm trying. So Noah didn't tell you anything about me? | actually feel like | know you. For once in your life, cant you just behave properly? Why did you come here? To fight? -No. | came to give you these clothes. What are those clothes for? Can someone please explain? Noah, is this the girl that was here before me? So you'e the one | spoke to on the phone? "Viper... Viper... Viper” Talila, | dont want to fight with you, but there’s a siren and | think you should go inside. With the two of you into the sealed room? Thanks, but no thanks. -Do you have to be so dramatic? Can't you just cut the melodrama for a minute? No. And you can' stop the... It doesn't matter. Get in the house. You'll catch a cold. Ms. Katz, where were you? -Ms. Katz, my foot. Leave me alone. I'm tired. -Why don't you come sleep with me. Just put all your feuding aside and come and sleep with me. For what? -For this. What am | doing? It's still arranged alphabetically. What are you looking for? "The High Windows.” “You haven't gotten over that stage yet? So | dont like Polish jazz. Are you going to shoot me for that? Have you thought about what | said to you? -What, that you want to marry me? What, are you serious? -Totally. It's not because of the missiles? -1 don't care about the missiles. But you care about me? If I'd have proposed six months ago, what would you have said? I'd have said: Yes. -Then why can't you say yes now? You know what? Maybe. Is maybe a yes? Maybe. What | cant understand is why Ofer proposed to me. Why now? Maybe he realizes that he made a mistake and he’s trying to fix it? Maybe he’s trying to make up for all the crap he fed you? And maybe he doesn't have anything better to do? Talila, you know what? You tend to go overboard. In my opinion, you have to consider it. Sometimes, a person has to know when to give a second chance, to forgive, especially if he asks your forgiveness so many times and tells you how much he loves you. He promises to make it up to you. Alona, what are you talking about? You took Amos back? What did you call him, a bastard, a maniac, a Freudian psychopath? -Shhhh... Don't shout, Talila. Be happy for me. Dont be mean. Besides, he coming over soon. Want some coffee? -1 don't know what | want. Do you really think | should get married to Ofer? Well, if I don't get married to Ofer, do you think that someone else will want to marry me, or that Il remain alone with my couch? Does that seem logical to you? Be nice to him. Hello. -It's Amos. -Come on up, bastard. | wont do anything to you. Neta, Neta, come quick! Come watch American soldiers. Hurry. Donny, come and dance! Let's dance. "Last will and testament” What's with Yaron? -He’s nuts. He's writing a will. Has he lost his mind? Hi, everyone. I'm back. -Hi. -Hello, Ronen. -Hi, Ronen. Hi. Welcome back. Hello, Talila. Hello, Talila. Hi. What about Tivol? Tivol's on hold. Everyone’s on hold. You're kidding at me. Haven't you submitted anything yet? | dont know about Amsterdam, but there’s a war going on over here. So maybe you should go over there with whatever you've managed to do just to seen what they think. This war won't go on forever. -You know what? That's an excellent idea. -Great, Talila. What's great? -Donny, come on. This is our dining hall. We redesigned it. We are very, very proud of it. Come in. Here's the administration. They say the hotdogs are amazing. A great success. Oh, hello! -You know Talila. Dino... -Donny. -Donny. Have a seat. Would you like to eat something? -Shechter, our CEO. Okay. Noah, this is the new corn burger, right? -Great. -Excellent. Will you come later on to see what this nice young man and woman prepared for us? -1 don't think Il have time. He's very busy lately. -He has a new girlfriend. Cant believe what a heartbreaker he is. Look how he dresses with his shoelaces untied. Like a bum. Hey, you're from Tel Aviv. Would a girl from Tel Aviv give someone like him a second glance? Would you go out with him? | can't really answer that. I'm getting married soon. Really? Congratulations! -Congratulations. Wait, let's fill our glasses. Haim, Daniela, Noah. Cheers! Congratulations! Are you nuts? What's all this about a wedding? I didn't even know you had a boyfriend. “What? You said you were getting married, didn't you? Would you stop butting into other people’s business? What? So? You're alive. Where have you been? If you're going to curse out Dad, then | dont want to hear about it. Hanna’s coming back on Sunday. -If you're going to make a scene then you should know I'm really not in the mood. I've already heard all your complaints about Dad. I don't want to hear any more If he's marrying Hanna. Let him marry Hanna. | don't want to be stuck in the middle. And I don't want you to tell me what a bastard he is and | don't want to spy on him. | want you to stop discussing it. You know what? It's not so bad. | thought it would be horrible, but it's not. | lived with him for so many years, let someone else live with him now. What about you? Are you all right? Ofer, that wonderful guy, proposed, and | accepted. So why are you crying? Don' you want to marry Ofer? Aren't you happy? | don't know. At least someone proposed to me... So why don't you stop crying? Ofer is a nice guy. Really nice... | like this one. Great. Barbeques and waiters. -You chose the invitations, you chose the place, and you chose the catering. Do you think | can chose the dress by myself? -Of course. Tell me when you're going. Il come with you. Have you already decided which position we'll use on the honeymoon? You need to get a haircut. Smile, everyone! “In general, we can say that "Sadaam seems to be somewhat hazy, “but in general, as you tend to say, "he is fairing well and joking around with his doctors. "Yes. Let's move on to another subject..” -Dad, change the channel. Dad, change to Amos. -"Milk, calf's foot jelly, grilled chicken, "hummus with pine nuts, tahini and olive oil "all on a plate with a pita...” -Yes..” Okay, can we begin? -Daffi, turn down the volume please. Grandpa wants to begin. -Mom: Tell him! Amos, the children. -Sit next to me. -Come here. -No! No! Don't you have any more wine glasses? - only have 4. Let's put it on the gift list. -Okay. We have gathered here tonight to make a toast in honor of two weddings. Are you sure it's okay that we're drinking in honor of Dad’s wedding? It's okay. Amos has a match for Mom. Really? What does he do? -He's a psychologist. Everyone says that this will all be over in a few days, and | must say that personally, | am glad, and I'm also happy to know that finally, someone is taking my little daughter. Yes, it's not easy. God knows, she’s not easy but I'm sure that the guy who gets her will not regret it, and that they'll have a lot of wonderful kids. Yes, of course, we can't overlook the fact that Ofer is so wealthy that | won't have to put up money for an apartment. That's good, too. I'm also wealthy. -Well, that's not important now. ~Amos is rich, too. Stop it. Stop it. I'd like to propose a toast to Ofer and Talila. Cheers! Daffi, Yoavi, get your masks. Mom! Amos, take care of it... Why did you switch the planters? -We wanted to switch to geraniums. Did you lock the door? -Yes. -Turn off the lights? -Yes, yes. It's a common phenomenon. There are marriages that thrive under pressure. Living with him was true hell. Amos, are you marking time? -At my age, is getting a divorce okay? We're on to weddings now. -Congratulations. Show her the invitation. Hurry, Daffi. Yoavi. Quickly, now. Come on, Yoavi... I just want to pull it tighter. Come here. I'll fix it for you. It's too small for me. I'm not getting married. What did you say? -I'm really sorry. | can't marry you. Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you all looking at me? | don't want to marry him, okay? He's not a bad guy. He doesn't murder children, and he doesn't torture cats. Does that means that | have to marry him? Ofer, Ofer... What did you come for? There’s no audience here. | came to apologize. Please, let me apologize. For what? For canceling our wedding 3 minutes after we toasted it, and in front of your entire family, In front of people | don't even know? For that, too. Also because | agreed in the first place. We can't live together. It's not right. So what is right? Your food engineer? And if he's so right, where is he? I don't know. -So what do you know? You date me, fuck me, agree to marry me, and let me choose the invitations. How long did you plan to drag this out? Maybe I should thank you that you didn't ditch me at the ceremony. Ofer, you'e not an idiot. You have to know that I'm right. See, that Noah. | don't know what's going on with him at all. He doesnt call me. Maybe he’s getting married to his girlfriend. | have no idea, but | can't get married just to get married. | thought | could. | thought | could do it with you. But it isn't right. "It is a time of pride. Pride in our nation, "with people whose strength and resolve made victory quick... "This morning, Israeli citizens received, with relief, "the good news that the state of emergency has been cancelled. "Residents from the center of the country were most joyful, "as tension and fear had kept them in their homes for a long time. "Minutes after the official announcement "you could barely see the streets...” | have no character. What should | do? Who feels like chasing him? There are a thousand others like him. I'll slash her tires to bits... Yes, and who are you? -Donna went back to Boston. No kidding? -I don't think that I love her anymore. No way. -It's true. So you're probably really broken hearted. Not really. You probably really miss her. No. You probably want me to let you in. Yes. Tie your shoelaces, you bum! "The sun is about to set "On the world. "See? It's already drowning “Into the sea. "Down into the sea "The seagulls dive. "The water leaves its shells "To you. "So come home already, "Little girl. "Dew falls like silver "From the moon.
