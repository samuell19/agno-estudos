Shit. Come on. Please, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Hello? Wah. Wah, wah, wah, wah. Wah. Here, boy. Come on, boy. Better not be taking my food. It's like it never even happened. Something wrong? - He's right here. - Edwards. - Where you goin'? - I'll be back. Stay strong, sweetie. You can't fight this forever. - I wonder what happened. - Him and his best friend... Your mother's been worried about you. It's time to go home. I mean, my son has never been in trouble before. I understand. I mean, he didn't do anything wrong. Your mom's a sweet lady. You mind if I come in? Mr. Edwards, I know you've been going through a rough time and I'm not here to add to that. I just need to, uh, find out what happened so we can find him. Okay? How long have you known Mr. McDonald? Long time. Long... Time. So good pals, huh? - Mack's my best friend. - Ah. Best friends. Wow. Well I guess if anyone knows where he's at, it would be you. You wouldn't have any idea where he might be, do you? Did Mr. McDonald ever say anything about running away or anything like that? - No, he... I mean, actually, yeah, he said stuff like that. He... He just doesn't wanna get stuck in this town his whole life. Hm. When was the, uh, last time you saw Mr. McDonald? I don't know, exactly. Any communication, text messages, phone call? Not recently. He say anything about what he was gonna be doing? Where he might be going? Anything? No. Where were you the night he went missing? I was with my girlfriend. I was at her place. With... Girlfriend. What's her name? What difference does that make? It's just a simple question I'm asking you. An irrelevant one. Look, I'm just trying to gather all the information I can regarding the case. That's my job. Uncovering the truth. That's why I'm asking the questions. Yeah well these don't sound like questions about the case. They sound like questions about me. This is supposed to be about Mack. I'm sorry, but I already told you. I don't know anything about where he went. You should stop wasting your time here and start looking for him. I don't remember it, uh, raining recently, Mr. Edwards. Are you listening? I feel like I was just saying how happy I am to have you back and I feel like you haven't even returned yet. I don't think I have, either. Sorry. I'm worried about him too. But Mack's smart, he's not gonna get himself into anything he can't get himself out of. Right. I just don't understand why he didn't tell us. I mean, he could've got hurt out there. I'm sure he has his reasons. They better be good. Can I get you anything? - I'm fine, thank you. - Fine. When did you get your truck? I grabbed it this morning. Were you out there the entire time looking for him? Yeah. I mean, as long as I could. Before I got lost. I'm sorry, baby. That's a long time to be alone. Oh, by the way, the detective? He thinks I was with you the night he went missing. Why? That's what I told him. So you lied to him? Yeah. I don't like him and I can tell he doesn't like me. If he knows that I was the last person to see Mack, he'd somehow use it against me. I feel like that's what he's trying to do. It's hard to explain. That's stupid, I mean, what if he talked to me first and I'd given him a different story? - Did he? - Well, no, but he could've. You know what? It's gonna be fine and Mack's gonna come back. This has all just been blown way out of proportion. Yeah. Hey, you should get back to the farm, before old Joe detassels you. Son of a bitch! Look who's back from vacation. Sorry, boss. You're one day away from being replaced, Edwards. Looks like you're short-handed. What? No, no. See, quality, not quantity. Those kids can teach you a couple of things. Hey, Maxwell, what the hell are you doin'? Don't! Just drop it, okay? Put it down. Just don't do it! You gotta be kiddin' me. All right, just take the row next to Ellison and Grant and make up for lost time. Right. You got it. Hey! Hey, Edwards! You seen McDonald? Him and his best friend disappeared and they can't find his friend. I wonder what happened to him. Summer's so long. I don't even remember being in school. It's like it never even happened. I want this to last forever and ever. Enjoying yourselves? As a matter of fact, I am. See, this is what summer break looks like, Mack. Oh, right. Your reward for being a good little student. Yeah, absolute freedom. Well, until next year. It's like a false sense of freedom. Just enough to keep you obedient. Well, apparently it didn't work with you. That's right. The system can't control Mack. Except from 8 to 12, Monday through Friday. Yeah. Yeah, I guess, but only for one more week. - Then I'm outta here. - Yay. All right, well, promise me you actually show up for that last week, pass the exam, and then maybe next weekend we go up to the lake. Do a little celebrating? Uh, yeah, I'm not sure about all that obedience shit, but definitely down for the celebrating. - All right. - Am I invited? Sorry, James, guys trip. Come on, you hate camping anyway. You'd be miserable. And then maybe next weekend we go up to the lake. Do a little celebrating? Here you go, love. Thanks, Mom. Have you heard from Mack at all? No, Mom. I'm just so worried about him. I mean, I know he's been in trouble before. This isn't the first time. We know Mack. But it's not like him to just run off and not tell anybody. And for him to not even say anything to you, I just think it's the strangest thing. I can't believe that he hasn't called or messaged you. No, I just hope that all is well. And he'll be back soon and that'll be that. All will be well. I'm just glad you're home safe and sound, Thomas. I can't imagine if anything were to happen, I just, not even gonna entertain that thought. Anyway, you just give me 15 minutes on these cookies, and then I'll pour you a nice glass of milk to wash it down with. Continuing tonight, the investigation of the missing teen from Eden and the mystery surrounding his disappearance. Law enforcement officials say they have found no trace of the boy and his whereabouts remain uncertain as the search continues. If you have any information, please contact the Eden County Police Department. The police are advising residents within a 20-mile radius to stay in their homes, board up their windows... Wow. That bad, huh? What? No, I... I'm just... You're distracted. Yeah, I'm distracted. Babe, I wanted to see a movie so it could take your mind off things. You know how you always say that you watch movies to escape reality? To get lost in a fantasy? Yeah. No, you're right. This was a good idea. Liar. What? No, it definitely helped me. Whatever. Come on. You ready to go home? What? Take me home already? It's 12:30. Yeah, but... I mean, you could, uh, give me another chance to distract you. Afternoon. Hope, uh, my stopping by isn't a problem. I was in the area and I thought, uh, now might be a good time to come back to some of those questions. Is that all right? Great. Can you tell me the last time you saw your friend? No. I don't remember. Did he tell you, uh, what he was gonna be doing that night he went missing, where he might be going? No. What were, uh... What were you doing that night? You've already asked me all these questions. Yeah, you said you were with your girlfriend? Yeah. "Jamie." I found out. You said you were hanging out at her place. Yeah, I talked with Jamie. She said... Oh, what was it? She said that she was with you that night. At her place. I asked her what you guys did that night. Now, I'm gonna ask you the same thing. I don't know, we ate food. Watched a movie. I don't know, we just hung out. What movie? Close Encounters. Yeah, she, uh... She couldn't remember, so, uh, I was just curious. That's, uh, that's a classic though. Yeah. My mom has dinner, so... Okay. Talk to you soon, Mr. Edwards. He just shouldn't be bothering you. I think it's incredibly insensitive. And for him to just show up at the house, unscheduled? I mean, I understand the first time it's protocol. That's fine. But really, it's rude to just keep showing up uninvited. If he wants to talk to you, he should at least call in advance. That would be the proper thing to do, but, I mean, honestly, I think he's wasting his time talking to you when he should be out looking for Mack. Oh, his poor mother must be heartbroken. Maybe you should call her. I bet she'd really appreciate that. On second thought, maybe not. Maybe give her some space. Anything out of the ordinary just might make her anxious. Tom? Yeah? We're out of milk. I already told you everything I know. Just leave me alone. What? You don't want me to help you find this kid? You mean Mack? Yeah, well he's not here, so go find him. You know what? You seem like a very troubled young man. A lot of built up anger. It's not uncommon for a kid your age, lettin' the emotions get the best of you, lashing out. Maybe doing something you might regret. When was the last time you and Mack got into a serious argument? So be it. I'll swing by Jamie's place. Maybe she'll be more helpful. No, you won't. Don't talk to her. Oh, no? Okay. Fine. She's probably dealing with a lot right now anyways. What do you mean? Well, you of all people should already know. Know what? The pregnancy. I swear to god. You better watch what comes out of your mouth. Hey, you shouldn't talk to me like that. Oh, one other thing. Hey, no, I'm done with all your stupid riddles, all right? That's it. Stay away from Jamie. Wanna know something funny? What? You know I hate fish, like won't eat it, unless it's like a really good salmon or something? Right. Well, lipstick has fish scales in it, so it's kinda like I'm rubbing a dead fish all over my mouth. My hair still needs work. You're awfully quiet. I know. I'm just tired. I haven't been sleeping much lately. That's okay, um... I've been having a hard time sleeping, too. Why? Mack. Yeah. He's gonna be okay, though. Don't you think? Has that detective still been questioning you? Um, occasionally. Just basic stuff. If I've heard from Mack, if I know where he's at. Just stuff like that. Obviously I have nothing new to tell him. Does he bother you a lot? Not as much as he bothers you. So you haven't told him anything? No, there's nothing to tell. Does he talk to you about other stuff? Like stuff about you? Um... Yeah, but just as it pertains to Mack. Are you gonna be ready by the time I'm finished? Does he ask you questions about us? What? Like do you talk about our relationship? Things about you and me? What? No. No. Tom, what're you getting at? I'm just wondering what you talk to him about. I already told you what I told him. You didn't tell me the specifics. Specifics? So what, now I'm being interrogated by you too? Just tell me what you talked about! I did. You didn't tell me everything! We didn't talk about anything. Why are you... Why are you freaking out? - I'm not freaking out! Really? Look at yourself. I just think I deserve to know what you told him. That's all. I told you everything! What? What, did he say something to you? I don't know. What do you think? What do you think he might've told me? Huh? Tom, stop. I don't understand why you're doing this. You're starting to scare me. I would never lie to you. I'm not hiding anything from you. I don't understand why- Are you pregnant? What the hell, Jamie? Tom. How long have you known? I, I just found out. I was gonna tell you. Oh, you were gonna tell me? When? After you tell everyone else? - I didn't tell anyone else. - Don't lie! Don't fucking lie! What? You didn't think he'd share your little secret? - I didn't tell him. - Bullshit! I didn't. Tom, please don't leave. Don't go. Please. Let's talk about it. It's too late for that. Come on! Come on! Come on! God damn it. Hey, man, let's go. Light me up. You're gonna have to come over here, unless you wanna lose this lighter. Come on, come on. No, don't throw it. Don't throw it. Thank you. What? I'm out of beer. Preparation, my friend. - Yo, where you goin'? - To get more beer. You're gonna go all the way back to the shore for that shit? Are you gonna share? Hell no. I didn't think so. I'll be back. Bring me that tequila, then. Tom! Tom! Fucking Tom, come back! Tom! Tom! No! Tom! Mack! Mack! Come on, man. Don't joke like this. Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack! Mack! Oh, honey, do you want something to drink? There's milk in the fridge. The milk's sour. Greetings, my friends. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember, my friends, future events such as these will affect you in the future. You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable. That is why you are here, and now for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened on that fateful day. We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal. The incidents, the places... My friends, can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space? Hey. Hey. Look, Jamie. I'm so sorry. You wanna come in? I'm an asshole. You didn't deserve any of that. It's just this detective... Tom, I didn't say anything. I promise. No, I know. I believe you. It's just in the moment and... I don't know how he knew. I forgive you. It's okay. I love you. I need you. I really need you. And this, I mean... It's unexpected. But... I'm okay with it. I think I might even be happy about it. I'll trade you. A baby for a ring. Oh, ah... I might have to get back to you on that one. You may have to give up corn detasseling and get a real job. Yeah. Boy or girl? How am I supposed to know? It's like, uh, like intuition or something, right? No, it's way too early for that anyway. Come on. Maybe we can ask your detective friend if he knows. He apparently seems to know about everything else. Except for where Mack is, obviously. What's wrong? Is everything okay? Come in, Tar Two. Come in, Tar Two. We've lost contact, sir. Baker Two, sir. All control plants in test area. This is a mayday. Repeat, this is a mayday. Proceed to statement baker one-seven. Search for Tar Two. Control from Tar Seven. Wreckage site at southwest corner, Solid at Flats. The ship appears completely demolished. No sign of survivors. Over. Roger, Tar Seven. Circle wreckage at one-zero-zero-zero-three until arrival of helicopter rescue unit. Hey, are you okay, man? Yeah, I'm fine. Just a broken ankle. Hey, love birds! The tassels are on the top. Let's get back to work, gentlemen. Never seen it so clean. How'd you know Jamie is pregnant? I'm a detective? I'm intuitive. I put things together. - She didn't tell you shit. - Yeah, she didn't have to. Have you told your mom yet? I'm sure she's gonna be really excited. You think you're ready to be a father? That's a big commitment. What the hell is your problem? Seriously! Just get out of my life! I don't think we're on the same page here. No, we're not! I'm on your side. Can't you see? I mean, sure, maybe I probe you with one too many questions at times, but I want the truth, Mr. Edwards. Like anybody else. And I wanna help you too, you know? Especially now that you're gonna be a father. And Jamie, I mean... You know, depending on how this whole case turns out it's possible she could be raising the child all by herself. You know, so I just wanna make sure that... Fuck you! All right. Thomas? I brought you a little snack. Thanks. Somethin' wrong? What? You look stressed out. I didn't know if something was bothering you. Anything you wanna talk about? - No. Am I a good mother? Yeah? I just, I hate seeing you this way. It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. I don't if I'm asking the right questions, or if I'm asking too many questions. Just makes me feel like I'm failing as a mom. Your mother's supposed to be able to comfort you and fix your problems, you know, that's what moms do. But I realize I can't. I can't make everything okay anymore. I can't make it all right. You've outgrown me, Thomas. Your issues are too big for me to solve, you know? You have issues only you can solve. Stay strong, sweetie. The man soaked in red is still bothering you. Excuse me? Your uninvited guest? How do you know about that? This isn't as big as you think it is. You got a good girl there. You hang onto her. You'd be hard-pressed to find another woman that loves you, as much as she does. The only other woman that loves you that much is your mother. That woman is a saint. I do worry about your friend, though. You know he'd have your back no matter what. You gotta do somethin', Tom. You have what most people would consider the perfect life, but this intruder, he's getting into your mind. You want to stay in this town, you gotta ignore him. You gotta forget about him. Don't let him invade your thoughts. He's got no power over you, unless you give it to him. That's about all the advice you're gonna get from this old set of bones. Uh, one more thing. Remember, nothing good lasts forever. Sometimes in life, there's things you can't cover up, or ignore. Sometimes you gotta face reality. Everything was perfect. Chaos knocks on the door of perfection. It always gets in. I thought I told you to keep an eye on that girl? Come on, kid, she's getting away. Hey, do the teachers usually hang out at the courts? I've never really noticed. Why? 'Cause I swear one of them was sitting next to me in the bleachers. At least, I know I've been in his class before. And he knew everything about me. Like, everything. What do you mean, "everything?" About my mom and you. And the detective. And he said if I wanna stay here, I need to avoid him at all costs. Like he was warning me. What? No, you're not going anywhere. You did nothing wrong. You're not going to jail. I don't think that's what he meant. Mack. Where are we? This way. What? What's the matter? Oh, my god. It's okay. Mack! Okay, go! Go, go, go! Three. Two. One. Where the hell have you been for the last five days? I had some things come up. Yeah, well, tassels are all down. Season's over. Already? What part of "seasonal" don't you understand? Time to find another job. Sorry, kid. Time doesn't stand still for anybody. World keeps spinning. Hey, kid! Fuck. Mr. Edwards! Pleasant night, isn't it? How is it? It's good. Yours? Pretty good. How are you? Tom, what's happening? I don't know anymore. We're gonna get through this. Nothing good lasts forever. Nothing lasts forever. Well, you guys look cute together. Tom, I wanna talk with you. One more thing! Tom! I know you were there that night. I know you were at the lake. It all adds up, Mr. Edwards. I know he's dead. Why'd you lie to me, Tom? You wanna stay in this town, you gotta ignore him. I just want to know, why did you kill him? Huh? I just need a motive. Hm. Jamie? What about you? You're pretty close to Mack. Did he do anything to you that, uh, might've pushed Tom here over the edge? And by the way, how far along are you? It's not possible that maybe Mack... He's lying, he's lying. He's lying, he's lying. And now you don't even know if it's yours or if it's his. Man, my, my money's on Mack. Sorry to say it. But that's the truth, isn't it? That's why you killed him. And don't let him invade your thoughts. I finally figured it out! You killed Mack because he screwed Jamie, and now your whole world is completely... Tom! Tom! Stop! Tom, stop! Stop! Stop! The man soaked in red is still bothering you. Your uninvited guest? Sometimes in life, there's things you can't cover up. Tom, you're freaking me out. Everything was perfect. Chaos knocks on the door of perfection. It always gets in. This town isn't as big as you think it is. Sometimes you gotta face reality. Time doesn't stand still for anybody. World keeps spinning. You watch movies to escape reality. Get lost in a fantasy. I can't make everything okay anymore. Stay strong, sweetie. I'll trade you. A baby for a ring. Tom? Is everything okay? Everything's fine.
