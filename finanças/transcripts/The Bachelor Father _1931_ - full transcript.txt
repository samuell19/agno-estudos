Is Sir Basil still at dinner, Bolton? - Yes, sir. Thanks. Are you feeling better? - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. That's good. I'll wait in here. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry about the strawberries, sir. I will speak to the gardener. Larkin. What is the matter with Sir Basil now? - It's his foot again, Dr MacDonald. It's has been paining him a great deal lately. I suppose he's been eating too much. - He won't listen to me, sir. Hello Mack. I didn't know you were here. You know Mrs Webb. - I haven't the pleasure. Mrs Webb, this is Dr MacDonald. You know John. - Hello, doctor. I'm afraid I had better be going home. With a doctor and a lawyer. Yes, I know. You want to go before the undertaker comes. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mrs Webb. Exactly who is Mrs Webb? She is a widow. Grass or otherwise? - Grass. She has been the principal in two divorces already. I had to see her go on her away. A nice girl, Mack. Can't you drink it, John? - Thank you, sir. Hey, what are you doing? - I'm sorry. You'll have a liqueur, Mack? - No thank you. And you shouldn't. No. You are right. Sticky stuff. I want a brandy and soda. Basil, Basil. Don't stop me, Mack. I need it. This old hoof of mine is paining me like .. If you understood your trade you'd give me something to cure it. If you eat less and drink less. I'm not going to consider that every time I sit at a table. Don't be such a fool, Basil. Being a fool is my favourite dissipation, Frank. Only one of them if I know anything about you. You don't. Ask Larkin. Larkin? What would you say was your master's favourite dissipation? Well, sir. From twenty to fifty-five. It was ladies. - You flatter me, Larkin. A stout fellow, eh John? But Larkin. What would you say was your master's favourite dissipation now? Nothing more or less than having his own way. That will do, Larkin. Get me a brandy and soda. Yes, sir. - He knows you, Basil. You're the most self-indulgent man I ever knew. I devote my life to pleasing myself. And why shouldn't I? I have no family. No relatives, thank heaven. You might have settled down and had children. Children? I've had them. Plenty of them. What, you? - Why not? No great feat. Anybody can do it. Even you have two sons. I like that. Basil. Where are your children? Dotted about at various points of the compass. I must say you're very casual about it. - They're nothing to me. I've never seen them. Why don't you send for your children? Make a home for them. What? Fill this place with a lot of noisy, ill-bred brats? You have a great sense of humour, Frank. - My dear Basil. You are missing the best part of life. You'll never know anything about those lasting affections. That bring love and warmth to old age. And another thing, sir. What about your money? You can't take it to heaven with you when you go. I shouldn't worry about that. Maybe I shan't go to heaven. Well, thank goodness I've got a family waiting for me. And you are afraid to keep them waiting. Perhaps it is best at that. You could never manage a family. What with your gout and your temper and your liquor and your self-indulgence. The children would never be able to stand you. Well. Goodnight to you. Wouldn't stand me? What next? I'll show him. John. Just where are my children? They are .. I'll look them up. Self-indulgent. Ha. Bad tempered. A good thing I brought the ledger, sir. There are no children against the first entry. 'Joan Pemberton'. Yes. I remember. A stout thing in a sweet shop. I remember in those days I liked them plump. Who succeeded her? - 'Trent. Katherine'. Yes. You have a son by her. So I heard. Go on. Then Credaro. Bianca. Bianca? 22 years since I heard her sing at La Scala. A luscious creature. She's in Florence now with her daughter. - Daughter? Yes. One of yours, Sir Basil. Yes. Of course. Then there is 'Christiansen'. 'Regina'. Before that? What about my last visit to the United States? In New York. A little red-headed thing. Remember her name? - Nancy. Nancy Flagg. John, that was the only girl I ever really loved. She was a dancer in a music hall. We have no record of her. - You wouldn't have. No such thing as paying her off. Any issue? - Yes. But a very small one apparently and entirely her affair. An independent filly. Then after her, Regina Christensen. - Yes. The slim Swede. She used to commit suicide every Friday. There is no issue there. That's all. Plenty, isn't it? Three children I think you said. Yes. That's right. - Now listen carefully. You're going to be my deputy. You're to go to the various corners of the earth. Collect my stray offspring and bring them to their father. Right, sir. - No. You have the address of Kate Trent's club. And the Italian girl. You can write to them. You'll have to go to New York to find Nancy's child. A girl or a boy? - A girl with a funny name. Tony. - Tony? I'll cable New York to look her up. I'll leave Wednesday for the States. - A stout fellow. Right, sir. There's just one thing. Supposing after I've gone to the trouble to get your children together .. You simply can't stand the sight of them? In that case, I treat them like puppies and drown the whole confounded litter. Hey, Tony. Alright. I was going to stop anyway. A guy downstairs says he came all the way from England to see you. Oh yeah? Well, if I give him a look, will he go straight back to England? Can the comedy. The guy is waiting. Well, you see. I was Nancy Flagg's dresser. Her dresser? - Dresser. All the time she was on the stage. When she died I took her child Tony to raise. I see. She'll be right down, mum. Richard, I was forgetting to introduce you to the gentleman. Mr Ashley, this is my son Richard. How do you do, sir. - How do you do. Tony and Richard are just like brother and sister. Fighting all the time. What part of England are you from? - From London. I got a letter recently from London. - Yes. Tell the gentleman what it said. It says, will I come over to England and fly the Atlantis plane back to New York. An aviator? Yes. He's a pilot. For Gotham Transport. And a good one. He once held the endurance record. Indeed? For two days. - Oh. Tony, darling. There is a gentleman here to see you. Mr Ashley. Mr Ashley? Pleased to meet you, Mr Ashley. Delighted, Miss Flagg. We'll be leaving you now so you can have a nice, quiet talk together. Come along, Richard. Why did you want to see me? Now, Miss Flagg. To begin with, I have been commissioned by your father, Sir Basil Winterton. To find you and invite you to England. He wants you to make your home with him at Roxford Hall in Surrey. Aunt Molly. Aunt Molly. Better stick around. This guy is cuckoo. What was it you were saying, sir? Well, I'm afraid I must have expressed myself rather awkwardly. I am a lawyer. In the employ of her father, Sir Basil Winterton. Sir Basil Winterton? Yes. Is this a gag or are you on the level? Do you mean to stay that my father is a duke or something? Your father is Sir Basil Winterton. D.C. K.C.B. K.C.M.G. Baronet. Of course you knew you had a father? I kind-of suspected it. But nobody even mentioned his name. I thought he'd been hung or something. - Oh no. Come here. Don't leave. Well. Where do we go from here? If I had my way we'll go to England. Let me get this straight. You mean to say I'm to chuck my job in the show here and .. And go and live with him? - Yes. Dick, wait a minute. Get a load of this. It turns out that I am the daughter of an English duke. And the old guy wants me to come over and live with him. Oh yeah? I'm the son of an Irish king myself. Horses. But you ain't going, are you Tony? Why not? After all, Sir Basil is her father. Well, it's taken him a long time to wake up to it. I don't know. Maybe I wouldn't like going over there and living with him. I am sure you would. Sir Basil is a very charming as well as a very distinguished person. Oh yeah? My mother was distinguished too. She was a headliner. She was that. And be sure it is me that should know. Didn't I dress her and strip her from one end of the country to the other? Well, Miss Flagg. What is your decision? I will go. Splendid. Now, will you please accept this? For your immediate expenditures. Thanks. And tomorrow afternoon I will call and leave a draft. If I may. - You sure may. Thank you. Here is your hat. Have you got everything? - I'll say he has. Goodbye. Bye now. Good afternoon. Toodle-oo. Good afternoon, sir. More power to your elbow. Now what might you be thinking of that? I say, old dear. Take this for your immediate expenditures. Here. Come here, you. - What's the matter? To be sure, I'll not touch a penny of it. Yes you will. Come on. - I will not. Sure. You will. Whisper now. A long while ago when I was a wee waif. Did you not take me into your family? It would be a fine thing if I can't buy you a silk dress every once in a while. So you're not mistook for the begging lady at the corner of the avenue. Here. Take it before I change my mind. To be sure, I might have known it. Last night I dreamed of a blond woman with a tail like a fish. It was a sure sign of someone going across water. I'd cross water myself to see that. A blond woman with a tail like a fish. Dear oh dear. It is a queer world. If Nancy Flagg could come back, what would she think of it, I don't know. Nancy darling. You asked me to look after the girl and I did the best I know how for her. Mum, you're going into a trance again. Snap out of it. Well. Well. Maybe I did what was right which is all for the best. Maybe I'm just a sinful old woman. What do you mean, a sinful old woman? Whisper, lad. Tony is no more Basil Winterton's daughter than you are. What? Are you deaf as well as dumb? I said, Tony was not Basil Winterton's child. The guy that was just here a while ago, mum. He said .. You must be mistaken. - Mistaken? The back of my hand to you for being an ignoramus. Wasn't I right there when it happened? You mean that Nancy Flagg wasn't Tony's mother? I mean Nancy Flagg was Tony's mother. But her father was a fly-by-night actor by the name of Tony Watson. Gee, what a mess. Hey, Mom. Tony ought to know about this. I'm going to tell her. - Shush. You stay right where you are. Tony's a good girl. Now she has a chance to make something of herself I'll not have you spoil it. Look, Mom. We got to do something about this. For instance. Tony goes over to England thinking everything is fine. Then for instance, along comes the other girl. You know, the real McCoy. You need have no fear of that. Basil Winterton's daughter died twenty years ago. No. She did that. [ French language ] Hortense, don't let them forget any of my grips. Tony, welcome to your father's house. House? Holy mackerel. This looks like Madison Square Garden. Wait a minute. Don't go away. You are not afraid of Sir Basil? Sure I am. Say, what do I call him? Your Grace? Your Highness? Your Honour or what? Just call him 'father'. And don't be afraid to be affectionate. Father! What's the matter? - No. Larkin isn't your father. Not my father? - No. Never mind, dear. It was a very natural mistake. A very pleasant mistake if I may say so. Larkin. Horses. Dumb crack number 1. The other two children have arrived, sir. They're in the morning room. - Splendid. I'll go and see them. Bolton will show you to your room, Miss. I'll have the rest of your luggage sent up as soon as it arrives. After you get settled, come down and I'll introduce your brother and sister. Well. Come on, Hortense. Let's go up. No? Wrong again. I guess we won't go up. Well, I guess I'll go and see the family. Hortense. Follow the guy with the grips. - Oui, mademoiselle. I guess I pulled another one. You didn't hurt yourself? - No. I hurt the rug I think. - Never mind the rug. Come and meet your relations. Maria. Here is your sister, Tony. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Your brother, Geoffrey. Hello brother. - An unexpected pleasure. You got nothing on me. Well, we're all here now. Unless you pull another rabbit out of the hat. No. I promise I won't do that. - I think three is enough. When that old guy sees us .. He will just .. Where's the big-shot? It's too bad that he's not here to welcome you, but .. You go ahead and make yourselves at home. Sure. That's what we're here for. Wait a minute. You're coming back, ain't you? Don't worry. I won't be long. That's the boyfriend. Rather a jolly kennel this. It should be very pleasant for us. All here together with our father. Do you know him? No. But my mother says he is a wonderful man. My mater says he has a good deal of appeal. Then one of them could not have been so well acquainted with him. If the old man is not up to scratch nothing could induce me to stop here. Right? Right. We will just be very sweet to him. When I see him. I shall salute him. Yeah. But how are you going to know him? I saluted the butler with a kiss. - You did? And called him 'father'. I could never make such a mistake. When he comes, there is something here. Inside that will tell me it is my father. I hope so. Well, well. Father, father. Hold on. Hold on. Let go. You do me too much honour. I'm not your father. - You are not? No. You see, my name is MacDonald. I am Sir Basil's doctor. Doctor? Sir Basil. He is sick? Well, he's not as fit as he might be. Where is Ashley? - He was in that room there. If you'll excuse me I have something very important to say to him. I'll see you all later. Well, it's a wise child that knows its own father. Yes. I made a big mistake. Yes. That something 'inside of you' sure gave you a punk steer. Well. Let's do something before we make another social error. Let's make ourselves at home. Yeah. Let's have a little .. Some music. Come on, Maria. - Come on. Pipe. Sorry, old-timer. But we can't use any fish today. No fish? - No. Call round next Friday. Hello, Mr Basil. You're back. You have met the children? Met? No? Children. Your father. Father? Uhoh. What time does the ship sail? Wait. That one with the hat. Mistook me for a fishmonger. Am I a mind reader? You bust in here with a basket and a string of fish. How was I to know you was my pop? I've never heard such gross impertinence in my life. Larkin. Take these fish to the kitchen. And these. After all. You must take into account this is the first time your daughter has seen you. Rubbish. Listen, mister. Don't get sore. We didn't mean to hurt your feelings. If we'd known you was coming .. We'd have lined up to give you three rounds of cheers. Perhaps I was a little hasty. I have had a hard day. I have a bad foot you know. - Yeah? What's the matter with it? Arthritis. - Arthur who? Arthur ..? Arthritis. Sit down. Ever try soaking it in hot water and mustard? No. Larkin. Larkin. Take that confounded rug from that girl before she kills somebody. Whatever is the matter? They are all the matter. So this is your brood? So John says. Well, I must say they do you credit. I like the boy best. She would. My dear child. Whatever have you got on your head? What do you suppose? What you got on your own head. A perfectly good hat. Yeah. A good hat for a horse. If he got tired wearing it he could eat it. My dear Basil. The girl is impossible. Don't you think, sir. It would be rather a good idea if they were to go out into the garden? Then we can talk things over. I don't care a hang what they do. My dear Geoffrey. The man is impossible. Well, Basil. I never saw this room so untidy. Such disorder. The swine. They ought to be in a pigsty. Geoffrey, your mother was right. That old guy is certainly a big pill. He is all of that. If we're to get anywhere with him we must gang up on him. Gang up? Yes. Organise. Sort-of form a union. - That's an idea. A sort-of protective union. - That's it. We'll call it: 'The Sons and Daughters of Sir Basil'. Huh? The Sons and Daughters of Sir Basil. That's fine. The S and D of SB. And hot or cold, win or lose, we'll all stick together. And if that old guy tries to pull any rough stuff on us. The SDs will call a strike and walk out SB. Basil. Have a look. What's up now? Those young beasts are abusing your flowerbeds. A pack of vandals ravishing my garden? John. Go out and stop them. I wouldn't do that if I were you, sir. - Why not? I think it's best to begin by making a good impression. I'll make a good impression. I'll see them now. Have them in. Come on. Very well, sir. Children? Hooligans. - Here they are, sir. Don't stand there like stuffed dolls. Come down. Come down. Come down. John. Is the boy deaf? No, sir. After all. Perhaps I had better introduce them. No need for that. I can find out who they are. They know who I am now though. They did mistake me for a fishmonger. You at the end there. Come on down here. She's a shy young piece, eh? Is she putting this on for my benefit? No, sir. No indeed. It's quite natural. You must remember that though you're her father, you are still a stranger. Yes. I know all about that. Well. Which one are you? I am Maria Credaro, sir. You took your mother's name? - Si, Senor. Do you talk English? Obviously. Yes, of course. Look what you're doing, my girl. Don't do that. Why don't you hold them tight? Well, how is your mother? She is very well, thank you. She sends her love to you. - Did she? Very much obliged, I'm sure. That will do. Sit down. Sit down. No. Mind my hat. You young fellow, I take it are .. Kate Trent's lad, eh? - Yes, sir. Come down here. And how is your mother? Rather under the weather lately, sir. - Too bad. She didn't send me her love I suppose? - No, sir. No. I gather she's given you what you might call a rather .. Rough sketch of me, eh? No. She never even mentions you. Is that so? Well, have you got any .. talents? Yes. Music. - Music? Well, do you play or write it? Both. Is that necessary? If you can't play the stuff you write it is .. I get your point. Yes. I am musical myself. In fact, if I'd studied I would .. You surprise me. - What? Surprise? Sit down, my boy. Sit down. Why surprised? Why should I surprise you? So that's the American, eh? - Antoinette Flagg. Antoinette, eh? Tony. Tony, stop it. My dear, what's the matter? Are you bow-legged? See for yourself. Why the .. gymnastics? Nothing. Just warming up for the first round. You think I'm as fearsome as all that? No. Just hard boiled. - Oh. You don't seem so negative yourself. That's the way I came. Oh. You mean it's your inheritance, eh? Well. Maybe I take after you. Basil. Is she the one whose mother's an acrobat or mountebank or something of that kind? Say, what do you mean, mountain bank? - Now, Tony. Mrs Webb was just asking if your mother was on the stage. Yeah? You can tell Mrs Webb that my mother was on the stage. And that she was a headliner. You can also tell Mrs Webb that if she makes any more cracks about my mother .. I'll start something that will take the snap out of her garters. Look here, young lady. That will do. Remember, you are in a different social circle now. I don't give a hoot about your socal shirkles. I mean shocal sirkles. Shocal shirkle. I'm getting out of here. Come on, gang. - Tony. No. The place don't suit. - You'll be alright. Let her go. Let them all go. Young hottentots. We didn't pick you for our father. If we had you wouldn't have been such a flop. If you talk to me like that. I'll put you across my knee and give you a darned good spanking. Pull that on me and I'll have you pinched. Clear out. It's nothing to me. You don't mean that. I don't care whether he does or not. I've earned my own living ever since my mother died. And I can go on doing it. - What's that? Is your mother dead? Is Nancy dead? Yes, sir. She died some years ago. Dear, dear. I'm sorry. I did not know. Your mother was a real good sort. An extraordinary sporting spirit. All that. - I'll say so. She wrote it. Words and music. I hope you forgive an old man's bad temper. It's my confounded foot, you know. Won't you .. Shake hands? I am sorry. I think you're going to be here for a long time. But we have to go into a huddle to decide that. What is a 'huddle'? A sort-of conference. Please don't worry, sir. I think everything will be .. Don't commit yourself. Excuse us. We'll leave it to you, Tony. Whatever you say goes. Okay. Fair enough. Now, we don't mean to be snooty or anything but .. There are certain things about you that we do not quite like. Indeed? - Yes. And then on the other hand. There are certain things about you that are okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. So, we have decided to give you a fair trial. To take you on probation. On probation? We'll stick around for a month and see how we like you. How you like me? I never heard such .. - Shush. Alright. Alright. Come on, John. Before I trample on their hypersensitive feelings anymore. Just a moment, sir. Just a moment. There's something else to be settled. How are we to address you? Yeah. What are we going to call you? We feel 'Sir Basil' is a little too distant. Quite so. Of course, at the moment, father is utterly out of the question. I have it. Why not 'Chief'? That's it. Chief. We're all out of the same fire house. That will do for tonight, Larkin. - Yes, sir. Stop fussing about now. - Yes, sir. Get my slippers. Where are the children? - They are upstairs, sir. Are they quite comfortable? - Quite, sir. They're in Miss Tony's room. She's instructing them in the game of craps. Craps? - Yes, sir. It is an American game and played with dice. Each player in turn. Shuffles the dice. Saying. 'The baby needs a new pair of shoes'. The dice are then .. Thrown to the floor. The player snapping his fingers exclaims .. 'Hot dog'. And enters a dance somewhat in this manner, sir. That will do, Larkin. - Yes, sir. I say, old bean. Where is Sir Basil? He is in the library, Miss. - Very good, sir. Hey, stop it. Stop it. Who is it anyway? It's that young Tony Flagg up to some more of her foolishness. You mustn't go prancing around the house in your pyjamas you know. I thought we could fight for an hour or so before we went to bed. I never fight. No? - Unless provoked. I have a very even temper. An even temper. You are sore all the time. - What, what? Well. Nice weather, isn't it? Speaking about the weather and the crops and one thing and another. How long have you known John Ashley? All his life. He was born here in the village of Roxford. His father is a very old friend of mine. Really? Has he .. Has he ever been married? Married? I should hope so. He has two children. - Two children? Yes. John and his young sister, Muriel. I mean has John ever been married? - Oh, John. He will never marry. He is all business. He is not the marrying kind. I don't care whether he is or not. He will fall. When the right girl comes along. No girl is going to get John. Yeah? Those that live the longest. Will see the most. Move over. Come on, don't be stingy. Move over. Hey. Stop it, will you. I bet if we got to know each other we could have lots of fun together. You think so, do you? About Mrs Webb? What about Mrs Webb? Is she the girlfriend? What do you mean? She is your sweetie? - Sweetie? Nonsense. Mrs Webb's a very charming woman. She has gone out of her way to be kind to me. That might be alright with you. But I think she has different ideas. That dame's a man-eater. A man-eater? Where do you get these vulgar expressions? Man-eater. Here we go. Round and round again. Why do we have to fight all the time? When I'll only be here a few weeks. My dear, you don't have to go away. Unless you want to. I'm not sticking around here if you're going to be grouchy all the time. What do you want me to do? I want you to act like a regular father. Geoffrey and Maria go to bed. And you don't even take the trouble to say goodnight to them. You think they want me to say goodnight? - Sure they do. Larkin, thank you. Larkin. Go upstairs and tell Miss Maria. And Mr Geoffrey. That I wish them goodnight. Wait a minute, Larkin. You can also tell Maria and Geoffrey. That their father is too busy to make a personal appearance. Young woman, I have not been up those stairs for three years. My confounded foot. You could lean on me. We can make it together. As long as you make a point of it. Alright, Larkin. Attaboy, Chief. I say, old dear. You've been eating too much lately. Too many steak and kidney pies. Too many brandy and sodas. And too much roast beef of old Dingland. Don't call it 'Dingland'. Alright. 'England'. Who is that? What in the name of .. Why are you barging around here at this time of night? I am putting out your riding togs, sir. Ridding togs? You know I haven't ridden for ten years. Are you going barmy? Miss Tony's orders, sir. Doctor MacDonald told her that you needed more exercise. And Miss Tony thought .. - Tommy rot. Get out of here. - Yes, sir. I beg your pardon, sir. But Miss Tony said .. That if you didn't get up when you were called .. She would come and pull you out of bed. Pull me out of bed? - Yes, sir. And she'd do it. - Yes, sir. Geoffrey, what is it? It's flying awfully low. If he's not careful he's going to knock the chimney pots off. I think he's going to land on the lawn. Larkin. Larkin. Come here. Shoo that fellow away. Look at him. He's coming down. Look here. You mustn't do that. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. Hello, Mr Ashley. - How are you, Berney? Glad to see you. When did you get in? A couple of days ago on the Mauretania. Just flew down from the airport to see Tony. Splendid. She's out riding but she'll be back directly. Come inside. She'll be glad to see you. - I'll be glad to see her too. Come along. Come along. There we are. Well, well. Aren't you going to dismount? It's going to take a major operation to get me off this horse. Perhaps next time you won't be in such a hurry to get me out in the morning. Come on. Lean on me. How are you? Gee. He looks nice and smooth. But he's got more corners than a rail fence. Come on. Yes. We read in the paper of your arrival at Southampton. I had a rough crossing. Not seasick I hope? - Not all the time. Oh. The weather on that Atlantic was something fierce. I'll have to talk to the horse about that one. Why. Why, Dick. Tony. I didn't know you with your pants on. You're like a breath of fresh air for me. Good to see you, Tony. What a surprise. - Gee, you look good. Gosh. Oh. I want you to meet Pop. Chief, this is Dick Berney. You know, the aviator. How do you do, Mr Baronet. - My daughter told me all about you. When do you make the hop? - We take off Wednesday June 2nd. Weather permitting. I wish you good luck. - Thank you. You'll take breakfast with us? - Sure. Sure. I don't mind if I do. - Come and make your pick. He's a swell guy, ain't he? - Yeah. I guess he is. How you making out, kid? I've been in England only three weeks. Already, I've learned to talk the English language. Yeah? Let me hear you do it sometime. - Sure. Say. I've gone a hundred percent British. Notice any difference? - Yeah. You walk different. Horses. The morning air has given me a fine appetite. Maria and Geoffrey look. What's wrong? What is wrong? - Everything is wrong. Doctor MacDonald tells us .. You eat so much it makes your foot swell up. Yes. And from now on you're going to be on a strict diet. Tommy-rot. I have got to eat. - Yeah? There is your breakfast. - What? Prunes and milk? No. I will not touch that futile mess. But you've got to. Look at your figure. Alright. I'll eat this stuff if it kills me. But I'll not eat this in public. Larkin. Bring that mess to my study. Come along, Maria. We'll see that he doesn't gyp. Hey, kid. Would you like to take a little ride? Horses? No. An aeroplane. The old taxi is just outside the door. Gee, I'd love it. - Alright. Get on a coat. I won't be a jiffy. - Tony, what about your breakfast? Give mine to the horse. He earned it. Say, Ashley. I want to ask you a question. - Go ahead. How is Tony getting along here? Splendidly. Sir Basil is growing very fond of her. Then she's sitting pretty for the rest of her life, huh? Well. I doubt if she does much sitting, pretty or otherwise, for a few days to come. I get what you mean. Then she's made good? - Rather. Come on, Dick. Let's go. Okay. All set, Tony? - Sure. I'll warm up the old buggy. If I don't see you again, so long. And if I don't see you again. Hello. John. Yes? - Tony is about? No, no. - Good. Where is she? She went for a ride with the American chap, Berney. A ride? I supposed she'd had enough riding for one day. She is a game one. She's a Winterton. It isn't her horse this time. It's an aeroplane. Aeroplane? You mean to say he's going to take that child up in one of those fool things? He has. Confound it, man. Why didn't you stop her? Let her kill herself? I never knew the equal of it. I leave the girl safe and sound, eating her breakfast. I come back and find her rocketing through the air in danger of her life. This family is going to the dogs. I'll put a stop to it. I'll show them I'm not to be trifled with. I will show them I am master in my own house. Oh, alright. Alright. I tell you again the girl Tony is Sir Basil's daughter. And all the king's horses wouldn't make me say anything else. If that is so, Mrs Berney. Who is this child? 'Antoinette Flagg Winterton'. Who died May 1st 1908. I know nothing about it at all. At all. Is that your last word? - It is, sir. Very well, Miss Berney. If you should hear anything more concerning this girl Tony Flagg. I would advise you to let us know about it. It may save you and the girl a lot of trouble. Sure, Mr Creswell. You wouldn't be talking about trouble. To a poor old woman with her husband in a grave. And her son in England. Well. Good morning, Mrs Berney. Good morning, Mr Creswell. May your shadow never grow less. And may the cross of Cromwell light on you .. For a sly, heathen, blaggard of a liar. So funny. Yes please, Larkin. - Yes. Wait a minute, Chief. John. Tell him. - Alright. Sir Basil. You'll remember that tonight is the last of the month's probation. The children, however, feel that they would like one final huddle. Before they acquaint you with their decision. Well. I trust the decision will be in my favour. And that I shall not be found wanting. Larkin. - Yes, Miss? Do your stuff. - Yes, Miss. He's coming, Miss. Colonel Sir Basil Algernon Winterton. D.C. Knight Commander of the Bar. Knight Commander of St Michael and St George. And all points west after Pennsylvania. Welcome to the fold, Chief. You have been nominated. Congratulations. Let's go, John. - Alright. Attention everybody. 'From the S and D of SB to SB'. Greetings. - From what? From the Sons and Daughters of Sir Basil to Sir Basil. 'Greetings'. 'Know by all present that Sir Basil Winterton, Baronet, VC, KC, KCMG'. 'Has passed the examination for the position of father with honour'. 'And is now entitled to all the love and respect that goes with it'. 'Furthermore, the undersigned agree that Sir Basil Winterton ..' And so forth and so forth and so forth. 'Is a good scout and a hot sport'. 'And if anyone denies this he will take a sock on the nose'. Bravo. Bravo. Sit down. Chief. Ladies and .. Gentlemen. I. I think a speech is in order. From his Supreme Excellency, Sir Basil Winterton. KCB and .. XYZ and .. BVC. Speech. - Speech. Hear, hear. - What? Bravo. - Don't interrupt. Ladies and gentlemen. Shut up. I wish to thank you. This is a great honour. I am the first man who has ever become a father .. By a majority vote. I believe I am the first Englishman. Who has ever received the great American title of .. Of .. - BVC. BVC. That's a great finish. Alright. Now it's my turn. Larkin. Tony. Just to make sure you are on time when you .. Drop out of the clouds. Another present. Let me at him. Hey, don't choke me. I could bite your ear off. Look at the ice. Tony, that's lovely. - John. You put it on. Maria. I thought of a way of keeping the frog out of your throat. Oh. Wear that, my girl. Papa mia. I forgot you. Well, here is a fiver for you. Go and buy yourself a pipe. - Thank you, sir. And that old fool MacDonald said they'd never be able to stand me. Coffee is served, sir. - Thank you, Larkin. They're a fine lot of children, John. They are, sir. I only hope that when I have children of my own that .. Optimist? Don't be rude, my child. Don't be rude. - Be yourself, Chief. When I was young, girls never said these things. They never even thought of it. - That's why they never said them. I'm going to put a stop to all this. You wouldn't do that? - Yes I would. I have done nothing but spoil you. Why shouldn't you? Aren't I your favorite little accident? What? How dare you. What do you mean? These children are young savages, John. They believe in nothing. I wouldn't say that, Chief. We believe you're our father. Tony, will you be quiet. You are, aren't you? - Don't talk about that. Excuse me. I am sorry. I've said I was sorry. Alright. But in future you mind your speech. Yes, sir. Want your watch back? - Yes. No you don't. Alright. If you don't want me to love you. I'll love John. Tony. She's trying to make a Jack out of you because she can't make one of me. I know, sir. I know. Don't think she cares a rat for you. I'm goofy about him. Here, here. Come out of that man's arms. No. I like his arms. Will you stop it? Shameless. Most embarrassing. - Alright. If it upsets you, I'll wait until you're out of the room. Horses. Why, Papa. Gee, I'm nuts about him. Is that the same as being goofy? The same. Only to me 'goofy' is a little bit more .. Passionate. If you know what I mean. Come here. Don't go away. John. You know, the first time I saw you in New York. I knew you were a square shooter. Thanks very much. And if the chief had sent anybody but you to New York .. I never would have come here. Tony. Nice of you to say it, just the same. I guess I'll have to go still further. John. As far as I am concerned. You can write your own ticket. Tony. What do you want? What do you want? - I beg your pardon, Miss Tony. But Mr Berney is here. And wants to know if he can speak to you privately. I can't see him now. Just tell him to wait in the other room. Business before pleasure. I am sorry, Miss Tony. But he says it's most important. He can only remain here a few moments. Well, can't you tell him that .. I guess you'd better tell him to wait. Very well, Miss Tony. Oh gosh. John. I have to go. I'll be right back. I'll get my coat and I'll meet you in the garden. By the sundial? - Yes. Then we'll pick up where we left off. Yes, John. Hello Dick. Hello kid. I was just thinking a guy could get a lot of wear out of a suit like this. Yes. And it wouldn't need much pressing. - No. It wouldn't. Come in and see the family. Wait a minute, Tony. I want to talk to you. Sit down. This will be about our last chance to have a talk together. You know, we make the hop on Wednesday. That's right. I forgot. I got a letter from Mom. Yes? Say, Tony. Are you going to stay here? Or not? Sure I am. Why shouldn't I? I'm awfully happy here. If you're going to go through with it you've a right to know how you stand. So you can protect yourself. What do you mean? Here's a note for you. Mum sent it in my letter. Some lawyers have been pumping her. Go ahead and read it now and get it over with. Dick. But Dick. This isn't true. It couldn't be true. I guess it's true alright, Tony. Why didn't she tell me? Why did she make me think I was Sir Basil's daughter? Why did she let me come over there without even saying a word to stop me? And now she .. She. It's a rotten trick. - Wait a minute, Tony. Don't be too hard on the old lady. She thought she was fixing it up good for you. Why does she tell me now? Now that I've come to like everything here and Sir Basil. Why couldn't she have let it ride? She thought that if she didn't put you right .. Somebody else might tip him off. Then what happens? They might put you in the hoosegow for impersonating a lady. They're strict about that over here. Yes. I know, but .. Oh, Dick. What am I going to do? Where am I going to go? Stay right where you are. You claim this Sir Basil loves you. Alright. Don't tell him nothing. I couldn't do that, Dick. He's got to know. But why? I've got to tell him. I can't go on here pretending to be something I am not. Stealing the love that belongs to somebody else. What do you mean, 'stealing'? The other party is dead, ain't she? Well? No. No, Dick. I've got to tell him. Now. But remember, Tony. No matter how it breaks. Me and Mum are standing by. Thanks, Dick. I'm awfully sorry. To say what I did about aunt Molly. When are you going to make the hop? If anything happened to you .. I don't know what I would do. Cut it out, kid. There ain't nothing going to happen. I'll make that hop like a frightened frog. Come on. Brace up now. I got to go. Goodbye, Dick. Goodbye, Tony. Well. If I don't see you again .. Hello. Goodbye, Dick. Happy .. Happy landings. For me? - Yes. Oh look. It's from the opera grand maestro in Florence. 'Engaged'? 'Member of opera company'. My girl. - Yes. I have received a grand offer. Of course it is not a big part. But such an honour. It says I must go right away too. - What? This fellow expects you to dash off to Florence immediately? Of course he does. No, no, no. Someone else will get the part. But Maria. Aren't you happy here, dear? - Of course I am. But my career. Yes. But why should you be an opera singer? No, no. I'd rather you didn't go at all, my girl. But You must understand. My big chance. She has come. And the big chance. Is the one thing that counts. Well, I suppose I have to let you go. I am going? I am going, Papa mia. Geoffrey. I am going. I am going. Well, Geoffrey. You and Tony will have to make up for Maria's absence. That is all. I am sorry, Chief. What? I meant to tell you before. But Maria's going seems to have made it worse somehow. What are you mumbling about? Hold up your head, boy. I'm sorry, Chief. But I have to go too. Go? Yes. Mater is ill. Not seriously, of course. But .. I have a letter here from her doctor and he wants me to come home immediately. Dear, dear. Well. Your first duty is to your mother. Of course. When do you want to go? If Maria goes tomorrow, I could go with her and see her off in London. It's my own fault. To let the twigs grow into trees before transplanting them. I've grown fond of you children. I'll miss you both. It won't be so bad, Chief. You still have Tony. - Yes. I'll still have Tony. And when you have Tony you have your hands full, eh? Chief. Tony. I just got a letter. I wanted to ask your advice about it. Of course, Tony. Of course. But. Tell me. Have you heard? Maria and Geoffrey are leaving tomorrow. Why? It seems they're a bit homesick. They like me and they're sorry to leave. They never got to look upon this place as home. Now with you, it is different. You have no mother. No. My mother is .. Dead. This is the only home you have got. And it will be yours as long as I live. And when I am gone .. Well, it will still be yours. Listen, Chief. You are sure you won't change your mind? No matter what happens? Reasonably sure. And Tony. Don't you think we could drop .. 'Chief'? I would like to hear you call me .. Father. Alright. Father. Goodbye, Tony. Say. If anybody tries to get gay with you, you just kick them on the shin. Goodbye. They've gone. Gee, Chief. You talk as though they were dead. I shall miss them. Cheer up. I can annoy you enough for the whole bunch. Sir Basil is at home? - I will see, sir. Will you kindly wait in the study? Good morning. - Hello John. Morning, John. - Morning, sir. They get off alright? What is it, Larkin? This gentleman is waiting in the study, sir. Yes. I remember. He phoned this morning. I'll see him. - Yes, sir. Are you stopping for luncheon, John? - Of course. John always stays for luncheon. Tony, I came down this morning on a very particular mission. Yes? Sit down and I'll tell you all about it. - Alright. Mr Creswell? Yes. From New York. - Won't you sit down? You don't mean to say you came all the way from New York to see me? Hardly, sir Basil. I come to London every summer. - Yes, yes. You may remember you instructed us to try and trace your daughter. Antoinette, Winterton. - I did. Yes. I regret having to inform you, Sir Basil. That your daughter is dead. Huh? I can't leave father now. I know, darling. I understand that I'll have to wait. But I want to be sure of you. Here is something to .. Bind our bargain. Holy mackerel. John. Gee. It's a peach. It must have set you back plenty. Plenty. Let me put it on for you. You know, I don't believe in long engagements. But a long engagement is better than no engagement at all. The original papers are in New York. This is the marriage certificate. 'Basil Winterton and Nancy Flagg'. Your second marriage I believe. Third. I mean fourth. I'm very sorry I was forced to bring you unpleasant news. But it's my duty to warn you against this imposter. I'm so sorry. Am I interrupting, Basil? No, Julia. This gentleman is just going. Good day, Mr Creswell. Goodbye, Sir Basil. Larkin will show you to the door. What is the trouble? Basil, you look positively ill. Nothing of importance. I started out to make the last jest of my life. And I find the joke is against me. What do you mean? Only that I have just learned. That Tony is not my daughter. So she's been living here all this time. Under false pretences. Isn't it possible that she didn't know herself? Can't we give her the benefit of the doubt? I am not so gullible. Of course she knew. How could she help knowing? [ Door knocks ] I beg your pardon, sir. I thought you were alone. Come in. John has something to tell you, father. But it's strictly private. Alright. Go and say it anyway, John. Well. I want to marry your daughter, sir. Which daughter? Tony, of course. Tony is not my daughter. If you still think the girl knows nothing. Look at her face. That's absurd. Of course she knows nothing about it. Ask her. I don't have to ask her. You didn't know anything about this. Did you? Yes. But not right from the start. Why didn't you tell me? I was going to tell you, John. And I was going to tell the chief too but .. I was afraid. Afraid of what? Afraid that .. Oh John. Can't you see why I didn't dare tell you? Well, if you feel that way about it. I guess we're through. Tony. You said you didn't believe in long engagements. Anyway. Tony, I don't understand why .. If you don't mind, John. I'd like to talk to the Chief. Alone. Very well. I said I would like to talk to my .. To Sir Basil. I have no objections. Listen, Belle. I said I would like to talk to Sir Basil alone. Now, there are two ways to go out of this room. Take your choice. Vertical or horizontal. Very well. Basil. I will wait in the garden. Until after she's gone. It looks pretty bad for me, doesn't it Chief? I don't suppose there's any use in me trying to tell you why I did it. Believe it or not, it was because .. We were getting along pretty good and .. I was afraid if I told you that .. That it would bust up everything. It isn't as bad as you think. I was going to tell you sometime. I suppose I should have told you right away. Anybody is liable to make a mistake. You said you loved me. But so did John. But as soon as I do something wrong. I am out. That isn't the way I love. When I love somebody. No matter what the other party does. I go on loving him just the same. That's the way I am. Why in heck don't you say something? There isn't anything to say. A weird way of showing you love me. Let me go around to MacDonald and the rest boasting about my clever daughter. I tell you I didn't know until after .. - Why didn't you tell me then? You never said a world. Even this morning, you let me go on telling them you're a regular Winterton. Laughing up your sleeve I suppose. Conning the old man, eh? - I was not. I felt ashamed. I didn't know which way to look. I'd give anything to .. - I won't listen. You're just like your mother. She could charm birds out of a tree. No matter what she did, she could always explain. You leave my mother out of this. This argument is between you and me. And you don't have to listen anymore. Because I am all washed up. I am finished and I'm going away. That's the whole thing in a nut-hole. I mean .. nut shell. I mean .. 'Nut-hole' is what you're trying to say. No it isn't. 'Nutshell' is what I am trying to say. Do you think you'll make it alright, Mr Berney? I beg your pardon, sir. There is a lady here. - Tony. They found out about everything. - No? When? Just a little while ago. I have to leave England right away. You have to take me with you. - Quit your kidding. I'm not kidding, Dick. I want you to take me. I can't do that, Tony. What do you think this is, a plumber's picnic? But I've got to leave here right away. Please, Dick. Alright, Tony. But you got to know what you're up against. It's a fifty/fifty chance we don't make New York. I don't ask anything better than an even break. Alright. We'll go. But I've got to see the big-shot first. Come along and change your clothes. Be back in a minute, Harry. - Righto, Guv. I don't think she'll make it with an extra passenger, Harry. Blimey. Neither do I. Berney told me last night she was taking up every ounce she could carry. Well, he's doing it. He ought to know. Well. They are all gone now. Every last one of them. Good riddance. I'm not too sure about that, sir. It is pleasant to have young people around the house. They seem to cast a sort-of .. Warm glow. You sentimental old fool. Yes, sir. Children are a confounded nuisance anyway. When they are around there's nothing but trouble and .. and .. And hooey. Yes, sir. Hooey. Sir Basil, I've been thinking this whole thing over. I am a fool. You consider that to be in the nature of .. news? Well, Tony is not to blame. She told me in New York she didn't know anything about her father. We dragged her here. When she found the truth she didn't say anything because of her love for you. Possibly for both of us. Tony is alright. Only we were too stupid to see it. Speak for yourself. Alright. I will. I am going to see her and ask her to forgive me. You have to find her first. Isn't she here? - No. Where is she? - I don't know. Hello, hello, hello? Yes. Winterton speaking. A statement about what? What is all this nonsense? My daughter is not going on any transatlantic .. What? John. That crazy child Tony is going to her death. No, no. - A newspaper chap said .. She's about to fly to America with that chap Berney. No. - Hello, hello? Cut off. Why didn't you stop her? Why did you let her go? I didn't expect anything like this. I couldn't have. If I'd been here I'd have stopped her. You should have stopped her anyway. Good heavens, why didn't you? Look, if anything happens to Tony, I'll never forgive you as long as I live. Don't stand there browbeating me. Stop talking. Do something. Get your car and drive over to the flying field. Yes. Alright. Hello. Hello. Is that the Morton flying field? What? Shop works? The wrong number! What's going on in here? - Everything's going wrong, Frank. I heard your daughter is going to make this crazy flight to America. Is it true? - Yes. It's true alright. 'Morton 1020'. That's what I told the fool. Basil, I have a mind to have you examined by an insanity board. The idea of allowing this girl to make a dangerous .. Stand aside, Frank. I can't waste time talking. Give it to me. Hello. Hello? Oh, blow it. Larkin. Tell Roberts to bring up the light car. Yes, sir. How can you be such a fool, Basil? You can never make it. Besides, John can do what you can do. I can't sit here twiddling my thumbs. - They're broadcasting it on the radio. Tune in the station. A stout fellow. A good idea. I hope John gets there in time. What station is it? Try 2-1-0. Come and try it. I am too .. shaky. All aflutter. Has the girl gone, Basil? - Shush. You shouldn't have let her go. - I know I shouldn't. You should have had her charged by the police to save others being swindled. I regret what I did. To say that about a child of mine .. - She isn't your child. Yes. But I love her more than my own children. Julia, you never liked Tony. If it hadn't been for you I should never have .. I only did what I thought was my duty. Julia, for the love of .. Have you no sense of decency? Perhaps at this moment my child goes to her death. You babble about 'duty'. - Her death? Tony is about to fly to America. The child will be killed. You shouldn't have let her go, Basil. Will you shut up? I'm sorry, Mrs Webb. [ Radio: ] "The identity of the young lady who's to be the third passenger .." "On this transatlantic flight has now been revealed." "She's the Honourable Tony, daughter of Sir Basil Winterton." "There's an authenticated rumour to the effect .." "That Sir Basil paid out ten thousand pounds to allow her to make this trip." "They are getting into the plane." Frank, this is awful. Where's John? He must be there by now. Why doesn't he do something? "The young lady is the first to enter." "She turns and waves a farewell to the crowd." "They are off!" "The heavy load of gasoline makes it very difficult for them to rise." They're off alright. "They are off the ground now." Blimey, they'll never make it. "They may not clear the trees at the end of the field." "The plane crashes into the trees." "A wreck." Steady, old man. "Intense excitement among the crowd on the field." "The mob rushes towards the scene of the accident." Can you go .. And see if you .. I will, Basil. - You might. I am alright. But where's Tony? Tony. Tony. Tony. Tony. Here, help me. A telegram, sir. If I might say so, sir. Worrying is no good. It won't bring her back. It's my fault. Something ought to have told me. How to save her. Should. Should. What can you do? If you don't give them their own way, they take it. And this happens. Shall I read it, sir? 'Sir Basil Winterton'. 'Roxford Manor. Surrey'. 'Dear father'. 'I am sending this before hitting the air'. 'Just to say'. 'You're a great old scout'. 'And you are not to worry'. 'Love and kisses'. 'Tony'. She thought of me the last thing. Yes, sir. She called me 'father'. Tony. Put her in that chair, John. Larkin. Cushions here. Quick. Tony. The doctor, Larkin. The doctor. Tony. Are you alright? Tony. Tony. I'm alright. But for a crack on the bean. Well. I hope this is going to be a lesson to you. In future, you will remain where you belong. Here. But I don't belong here. - Yes you do. I am going to adopt you. You attend to that, John. That's unnecessary, sir. You see, we're to be married. Married. What? Married? I tell you that no young jackanapes .. - Sir. Sir? What do you mean by saying 'sir' to me? Please men. Please don't fight. I can settle the whole thing in a jiffy if you'll just listen. I'll be your daughter in the daytime, father. And I'll be John's wife in the .. Evenings. I'll tell you .. Oh, alright. ..w-g..
