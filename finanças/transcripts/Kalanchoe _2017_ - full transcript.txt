Monday, July 4. I know this is going to look good on you. It's too red isn't it? Not at all. Reminds me of Kalanchoe, my favorite flower. It's going to be super cute. Huh. Did you know it? Nope. Do you want to take it off? No I'll keep it on. Really? I'm glad. Don't forget your lunch. OK. Written & Directed by Shun Nakagawa. Kalanchoe. Sana. Let's go together. - It's so hot today. - Yeah. Was something wrong last Friday? Didn't you leave early? Yeah, just felt a bit sick. Are you alright? Yes. I rested at the infirmary and felt better right away. - Oh good. - Thanks. They are fighting in that kind of world. Awesome. Like a rap. Let's go to practice. You got me fired up. That's a hot phrase. Yo, I'm on fire... - Tsuki, morning. - Morning. - Thanks for your notes. - How was it? - Your notes are great. - Thanks. You know, you spell "English" with an L, not R. You're right! Oh no. How embarrassing! Oh, no! And I worked so hard on it. A red scrunchy? How unusual. Mom bought it for me yesterday, but... Really? - Does it look weird? - No it looks really good. Did you see our physics teacher? Not really. He's dangerously cute. Nobody is that beautiful these days. Amazing. Are you into the cute guys too? Yup. Dangerous. Seriously. Watch out. He is not cute. - Really? - Really. He is not cute. You always insult the guys I like. Everyone, be seated. Hey, Hana? Is that you? Sit down Mr. Saeki! What's up, Hana? Wow you are hot. You are hot today! All rise. Bow. Thank you. Be seated. Due to your teacher's absence today please use your English lesson period to study. I would like to speak with you all today about something. Class, have you heard of the word LGBT? The abbreviation LGBT stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. Lesbians are women who like women. Gay implies men who like men. Bisexuals are attracted to men and women. Transgender means people whose gender identity differs from their sex. Currently in Japan, it is estimated that... Hey, what's up Hana? Huh? 7.6 % of the population are LGBT. LGBT is not a disease. LGBT is not abnormal either. However people are prejudiced and discriminate against them. Perhaps some of you in this class may have difficulty accepting it. If so, that really is a shame. Liking someone. Falling in love is a matter of the heart. Love does not happen by thinking it. Whether heterosexual or homosexual, once you fall in love, that's it. The person's sex makes no difference when you are in love. I'm home. - You're back. What a hot day! - Too hot. - Take a bath to freshen up. - I will. Delicious. Thanks. Mr. Yamano was ill today, wasn't he? How did you know? He's the son of the grocery shop. Yes. I went there today and his father said so. Scary how connected you are. Mothers know everything. Can't hide anything from you. Behave. Well, since Mr. Yamano was absent from school today, we had health education instead. Do you know anything about LGBT? Isn't it about gays and homosexuals? That's right. Do you know anyone like that, Mom? Yes, I do. Yes. About those people, how are you with them? What do you mean? Are you afraid, or uncomfortable at all? I couldn't say. I have never directly interacted with them. Humm. This needs more soy sauce. But that is really great. They now teach you that at school. Humm. - Then say they're all wrong. - Wrong? Yes, to what I say. With feeling really think about it and say "you are wrong." You want me to say it is all wrong? What're you getting at? What's Yuya up to? Don't you know? When Kato tells a lie, he always does this! Keep watching, I'm telling you. Okay then. The answer is this. For the last question. No, it's wrong. Is this the answer? No, it's wrong. Is this it? No, it's wrong! The answer is the Jinshin War! Correct. If you knew the answer, say it from the start. For God's sake. - Let's go, Tsuki. - Wait a second. Hey, hey, Yota. - I just realized something. - What? About Hana's class yesterday on gays. I asked other classes, and Hana only talked to us. Yeah? Isn't it strange? Hana spoke only to our class. So I thought... Maybe... There's one in our class. Seriously? In our class? Why just us then? No, no. That's far-fetched. Girls, the basic rule. Check his ring. Should we? I made some cookies. You want some? Yay, I do. I do! Thanks. Thanks. At 26, that's a rare quality. Too young? No, it's perfect. Plus, he's a physics teacher. Maths aren't enough? No! Maths teacher can be sarcastic. Really? Wow, delicious! I'm so glad. Oh my God! Super tasty! Hot and crispy! Yummy! Thanks, I'm glad. I loved those chocolate ones you made. You mean brownies? Brownies. I forget the name. I practice it. That would be biceps. What about them? You have to have muscle here to have big ones. - That's a vein. - I said muscle! What's up, girls? Maybe too close, very close. Let me guess, you girls are lesbians? How immature! I got it, yeah? Come on, tell the truth. Come on girls! Hey. Do you think... Hana has a boyfriend? - Definitely. - Really? Are you sure? I don't know. But the way she is, yes. Ouch! I'm heartbroken. You are a dork. All right. How about you? About what? I mean, recently... - is there anyone? - No way! - Wait. - What? Oh, there's someone! No, there's no one. Come on, tell me. Seriously, there's no one! Recently... you know? No way! Look, she's here. You boys again, don't get too comfortable here. Can I ask you a question, Hana? What is it? Do you have a boyfriend? That's personal. Actually, Yota wanted to know. I'll never trust you again. - I've got another question. - What is it? Is there someone gay in our class? Or a lesbian or other creeps. You only talked to us about it. Other classes had self-study during English. Who in our class? Then why just our class? I didn't have time. Sounds a bit fishy, doesn't it? We'll investigate this. It's a new game. That's enough. Why don't you go home? - Stop it. - We'll find out. It takes a good judge to see it. Show us then. - I'm still mastering it. - All right. - I practice three times a day... - We know! Here I go. For the viewers of Pon." "Good morning. This is Suzu Hirose." Humm... Ouch! That bad huh? You are almost there. That was good. I'm improving. I can also do Tao Tsuchiya. Want to see it? No, thank you. Really, we're fine. Be kinder and say you will. Wednesday, July 6. Please start. All rise. Bow. Thank you. Be seated. Before we begin, I'd just like to say one thing. The other day, there was a class on LGBT given by Ms. Kojima. I heard a rumor is being spread that there are LGBT people in this class. That is extremely sad. Let me be clear about it. The lesson on LGBT was not given for an LGBT person in this class. We want you to have awareness of such differences- Unbelievable. In society of adults. - So they exist? - Yes. Are you kidding? That's bad. Shimizu must be. I totally agree. What are you doing? What? Nothing. You're taking it too seriously. Cause you keep going on and on. What do you mean? People have feelings. Hey, maybe you are so serious. Because you are gay. Knock it off! Cut it out! What's it to you Yuya? Why are you making such a big deal out of this? Then let me ask. You want to pretend that no one is in this class? Like an elephant in the room? Isn't that a discrimination? - It's not. - Then what is it? Don't make it a big deal. That's enough. Where're you off to? Why am I the bad guy? Sana? You okay? Yes, I'm fine. Not feeling well? I'm OK. What happened? Sana? I don't know what to do any more. I... I know who it is. The person everyone is talking about. Last Friday, I went to the infirmary. I heard the person talking with Hana. They are in pain. I really wanted to help somehow, but I didn't know what to do. Who... is it? Sakura. Tsuki. Going home? Yes. You, too, Sakura? Let's go home together. Yes. What's wrong? What? Are you feeling down? No, I'm fine. I see. That scrunchy does look good on you. You think so? Yes. It really suits you. Thanks. What? Nothing. Is it really ok for you to get off here? Yes. I have to stop by somewhere. I see. You know... I didn't want to tell you like this. Because I wanted you to understand, Tsuki. What's wrong? Something happened? No. Never mind. See you again. Thursday, July 7. You'll be late for school. Yeah. You don't have to wear it. - What? - The scrunchy. Oh this. I don't mind wearing it. Oh? Then think of it as a charm. Why a charm? In the language of flowers Kalanchoe means protection. That's why it's a charm. "Sakura Komaki is a lesbian." Where is Sakura? Her bag's here, but... Oh my, what have we here? Is this true? So it's actually happening. Hey. It's not true. Not Sakura. Sakura isn't a lesbian! Sakura! Sakura! Sakura is a lesbian? How gross! Don't you care about her feelings? What are you saying? - Look. - What? Under these circumstances, you can't be sure, can you? What're you saying? I thought you were saying... Just shut up! - Shut it, damn it! - Well, damn you! Sakura! - Wait! - Just ignore it! It doesn't mean a thing! Why are you taking my side? I'm sorry. So sorry. It was me. I wrote it on the blackboard. I'm sorry. Friday, July 8. - Omiya. - Yes. - Oda. - Yes. - Kato. - Yes. - Kawashima. - Yes. - Kawahara. - Yes. Komaki. - Sano. - Yes. - Sawamoto. - Yes. - Suzuki. - Yes. - Soma. - Yes. - Soga. - Yes. - Takayanagi. - Yes. - Takayama. - Yes. - Tsutsumi. - Yes. - Tsumori. - Yes. - Terada. - Yes. - Nakamura. - Yes. - Nagata. - Yes. - Nojima. - Yes. Friday, July 1. There is someone... I really like. Yes. That person is... a girl. I see. The girl is... always smiling like sunshine. She has the biggest smile that makes everyone smile. When I'm with her, she makes me smile, too. When we go home together, I feel my heart beating. It's the happiest time for me. - Good times. - Yes. I like to bake cookies, so I bring some to school. She really enjoys eating them. Her smile is so healing. She's cute huh? So I'll make more cookies for her. And... sometimes, she can be spacey at times. Really? She can't tell the difference between R and L. What? Definitely spacey. But that is her charm. - But... - Yes? I think I have to tell her about my feelings for her. But she's a girl. So... When I think about her reaction, I became very nervous. So I still cannot confess to her. I see. I hope she enjoys your cookies. I really hope so. Can't wait. Written, Directed & Edited by Shun Nakagawa. I can't wait to see her smile. May I come in? Hey, are you all right? I think it's my anemia. Do you feel dizzy? You better lie down. Sana, are you all right? Yes, thanks. - I'm going, Ms. Kojima. - Sorry. Sorry, Sakura. No, no, have a good rest. Ms. Kojima? Can I come to talk to you again? Of course, at any time. I will.
