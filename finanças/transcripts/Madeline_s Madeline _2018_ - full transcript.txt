[purring] [liquid sloshing] [soft yowling] There you go. Nurse Kelly, can you bring the gloves? What you are experiencing is just a metaphor. The emotions you are having are not your own. They are someone else's. [yowling intensifies, muffled] You are not the cat. You are inside the cat. Now lie back. - [yowling, purring continue] - Oh. [shuffling] [groans] Are you... [imitating meowing] [gagging] [imitating soft yowling] Are you okay? - [imitating meowing] - Hey there. Yes. Yes, my sweet kitty. Yes. [purring] - [rattling] - [gasps] [sniffs] Oh! [laughs] Oh. Do you want a little scratching, kitty? - [purring] - Does that feel nice? [laughs] Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh, kitty. Yeah.

[woman laughing] [breathing] [woman laughing] [crunching] Madeline, what are you doing? I was a sea turtle. You were a sea turtle, and then you were a woman playing a sea turtle. - Look at your hands. - [actors barking, growling] Hands. Whose hands are those? Are they yours, or are they the turtle's? [actors groaning, snorting, howling] - [roaring loudly] - [woman] Yes, that's it. You're there! You're there! [roaring continues] You're there. We can all feel it. [woman] Good entrance. I like that entrance. [laughing] - [woman speaking, faint] - [woman 2] Yeah. We don't really have, like, a professor. [grunting] [woman] That's great. Feel that beat. [loud gasp] [sharp exhaling sounds] [whispering] I think you should come with me right now. - Okay. - Come with me, honey. - What is it? You're in my... - [yelping, howling sounds] - [clattering] - Shh! - [snickers] - What is going on? [chattering] [all] One, two, three. [screaming] [screaming, laughing] [laughing] Duck down! Duck down! Drive! Drive! - Okay. - Duck, duck, duck! Duck down! Duck! Drive! Drive, drive! - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - Go, Mom! I'm going, I'm going. - [tires screech] - I can't duck and drive. Just go! Just go! [gasping] I'm going! Are you okay? Yes! [laughing] Oh, my God. We just mooned Evangeline. [laughing continues] - You did? - Yes. Let's go! [whimpering] I thought you... I thought something had happened. [sniffs] Are you really okay? - Mom. What... Why... We-We-We just ran away. - Were they mean to you, or...? No, no. They're really fun. They're nice. - But they're always, like, making fun of you, or... - No, that's at school. - [sighs] - Can we go now? [whimpering] But you were running from them. [sighing] [rhythmic exhaling] - [purring] - [rhythmic vocalizing] [hissing] [purring] Great. Great paws. It's so... It's so... The cat has its own personality. I mean, when you invest like you did, it's not just an idea of a cat, it's... great. Okay, moving on. [inhaling, exhaling] [Evangeline] Uh, Jamal is a friend of mine, and he's come and offered to share specifically some of his experience, uh, being incarcerated. And thank you so much for coming. Well, thank you for having me here. We really appreciate it. Um, how do you... How does it... Do you want to just talk, or do you want us to ask you some questions? - What's good for you? - Uh, whatever works for you guys. Just go around, ask a few questions. Did you get out because your sentence was over? Did you get out early? You know, how long have you been out? I spent two years and three months in a cell by myself. Your brain... Your mind is always working. And it's like, you know, you have to stimulate it to keep it going. I would read the back of my toothpaste. Like, the fluoride and, you know, like, chloride or whatever. Whatever the percentage. If you could change one thing about the past, what would it be? Um... my association with people. Does anyone else have an experience or a moment of violence that's happened to them that they might want to share? [indistinct chattering] ...to give you a hug. Would you mind? - [laughing] - You're so tall! Come down here. Okay, let's do, um... Let's do an improv based on the theme of "no way out." - Okay, we're basing this on Jamal's stories, right? - [Evangeline] Yes. - His prison experiences, right? - An open canvas on the theme ofno way out. [Evangeline] In a simple, single gesture, crossing the stage. [actors breathing rhythmically] [Evangeline] You want to jump in, Madeline? [rhythmic breathing continues] [rhythmic breathing stops] Are we gonna... Are we gonna use his story? Is it Jamal's? Is Jamal gonna be the character? Is he one of the pigs? Why is prison relevant to this? Hey, Evangeline, can we ask you something? Is this a metaphor? Are we using prison as a metaphor? So what are we making? [Evangeline] This is just a metaphor. But, so... I mean, I just really wanted to stay after rehearsal. - I'm just bummed I'm not staying after rehearsal. - Well, do you want to walk home? No. I wanted to tell Evangeline something. And we're always late so I never get to talk to her. - It's a five-mile walk back. - No, I... - Shit. Fuck it. - What? - Go to rehearsal, go to rehearsal, go to rehearsal. - What? Okay. What? What? - You just... You wanna... You wanna go? Okay. - Mom... - I thought we were ordering takeout. - Mom! I said we can go home. You wanna go, so go. Get out! - No! Mom, we can go home. - Get out! - Out, out, out, out! I will be waiting here! - No. No. No. We can go home. Mom, what would you be if you were someone else? Do you mean, like, a famous person? No, he means, um, if you could cut out someone's face and wear it as your own, who would it be? - You been smoking? - No. Oh. Oh. - You mean... - What's your answer? Spring rolls. - The sky. - Sky, as in the YouTuber? The motherfucking sky. - [mother] Okay. Yeah. - The sky. You don't have to use that word. - Yeah, Madge. - W-Well... Don't call me Madge. [boy] Okay, Madge. You know what? Call me Madge one more time, and I'll cut your face out and wear it. [boy] Well, I would be Chris Paul. - You're not gonna eat anything? - You'd be cutting off Chris Paul's face. Do you want some peanut butter toast? [boy] Yeah, do you want some toast? Put some little peanut butter, Madge? - [makes chomping noise] - Asshole. - I'm gonna cut your face out. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No scissors. - This is my face. - You can have my face! - [mother] I mean, I don't... - [chattering] Ijust wish that I knew she was safe. You know? Or that I was safe. She threw an ashtray at her brother's forehead. He had to get stitches. [mother continues, muffled] If we move away from the prison concept we need more rehearsal time. We can't afford this space here anymore. - So, it's a... - Hey. - No, I... - Um, can I... - Can I talk to you about something? - Sure. Sure. [actors chattering] I had this dream that I wanted to tell you about, but, you know... I know. You know what they say about dreaming. You just have to trust yourself. Jung says that... [exhales] in all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order, that the pendulum of the mind swings between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong. Dreams are awesome. I dreamt I slammed my mother's hand with an iron. I couldn't breathe. It felt like I was underwater, watching her. Anything like that, you can always share it with me. I dreamt you were my daughter. Do you feel safe around your mom? [chattering, laughing] Ladies, let's go. Let's get in here. Gotta celebrate. [no audible dialogue] - Harsh. - Shut up. I just have to watch out for the, um... - For the cracks? - Yeah. The, um... All right. I mean... Stop. We could race. Life has a lot of pain in it. - [snickering] - No, I'm serious. - Uh-huh. - But, um... - Like, Socrates said that or something? - [laughs] - No. - Uh-huh. Socrates didn't say it. Aristotle did. [laughing] [both sigh] You're kind of making a new dance up. It's called, like, the roller blade stutter step. [both grunting] [laughs] Oh, man. [sighs] You're really quiet. Oh. No. - No? - No! You're like, my hair's just blowing in the wind. [both laughing] [kisses] Oh, sh... Where are you going? - Good night! - You're going home? - I mean, can I get a kiss without the hair in it? - [laughs] [panting, gasping] [squealing] [laughing] [laughter echoing] [man] She is lovely. [man 2] How far is she gonna go up your ass though? You know what I mean? [chattering] - No, that's Adrianna. Chill. - [chuckling] Adrianna, what's up? [chattering continues] - Going to the park? - [Adrianna] Yeah. You going to the park? Hey, Madeline. What's up? - [cat meows] - What's in your basement? Yo, me and the guys over there, we took bets, and we think there's five dead bodies in there. Five, for every finger on your hand. I killed 'em with my fingernails! - [cat meows] - [chuckles] You're weird. I feel like this is the start of an M. Night Shyamalan movie. [laughs] - [Madeline] Okay, what do you guys think? - [groaning] Yo, check out the titties everywhere. - Oh, God. Henry. Henry. - Your dad likes white women. - Yeah, he does. - He sure does, dude. My mom's white, so... Ooh! Jungle fever. - [Madeline] What? - Check it out. MILFs. - [Madeline] You guys want to watch it? - No. - Why? You've seen it before? - Yep. [Madeline] What, are you guys, like, porn freaks or something? I wouldn't say "porn freaks." More like porn scholars. - Right? - Yeah. [Madeline] Okay, Henry, move. I'm gonna find something. How about Dr. French and the Llama? [Henry] Oh. Dr. French? [TV: woman] Do you want me to hold her down, Dr. French? - You like this, Madeline? - Not really. - [moaning] - [Madeline] Oh, she's eating her ass. I think I'm gonna need some help here, Dr. English. [Henry] Your dad sure is into that good stuff. [TV: woman] Bring me the whip. Show me where it hurts. - You come down here and make out? - [TV: woman] Yeah. - [Henry] I've never been in here a day in my life. - No! [laughs] Oh, God. If you keep saying that, I'm gonna have to throw you out. - You got Steamboat Willie? - [Madeline laughs] Yeah. What's... Oh. - Oh. Hey. - [TV: woman] Don't hurt me. Ouch. Ouch. - [mother] Madeline? - Ouch! Ouch! [whispering] Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Fuck. - [TV: moaning continues] - [muttered chattering] [TV: moaning intensifies] [TV: woman] Is that right? Okay! Ah! Yeah. [Madeline] I was just showing them the basement. [TV: moaning continues] Mm-hmm. Why don't you sit down. Let's watch this! Okay. Right? Sit down, Madeline. This what you were doing? - This what I interrupted? - [Henry] We were just... Yeah? Well, just do it. Go ahead. Do it. Whip it out. [TV: woman] You're putting it in her asshole! This is a good idea? You want her in a psych ward for another six weeks? With her condition? - [boy] Are you crazy or something? - No. I'm not. I'm not. Mom. Mom! [woman] We're not in your office. It's just a metaphor. Get out! Get out! [TV: moaning continues] Madeline the slut. The slut Madeline arranges a special treat for me. That is... [chuckles] Okay. All right. Okay. We're done. Done. Done. [TV: moaning continues] [sniffles, gasps] [groans] No. No. No! - [hair rips] - [gasps, screams] - Would you like some help with that? - Uh-huh. [moaning continues] [mother gasping] [Madeline screaming] Lay down. Lay down! - [moaning] - Put your head down! Lie back. Lie back! - Hey. - Hi. [people whispering] [all shouting] Surprise! - [chattering, laughing] - We thought you were Evangeline! She's pregnant! She's pregnant. [laughing] We're so excited! Oh, cool. Um... - Well, I want to say congratulations too. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. [chattering continues] - Okay. - Shh-shh-shh. [Evangeline] Hello! - [whispers] Okay. - Where is everybody? What the hell? Max? - [all] Surprise! - [laughing, chattering] - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - [Evangeline] For what? - For being pregnant! Yeah, I told... [laughing, chattering continue] - For the next generation! - Oh! [Evangeline] Just for today, we're gonna... Madeline and Santos are gonna be doing that workshopping, so let's... Okay, let's party for a little bit. - [cheering, chattering] - Hi! Thank you! - Take a piece. - Why you picking at your hands? Wh-What? Why are you so jittery? Relax. I'm not. Why are you looking at my hands? - This is for you. - Oh. - Madeline? - Hey. - You okay? - Hey, you know... Come talk to me. I've been thinking about how fun it's been to work with you. - The group's been struggling. - Yeah. And you get my work like no one else. This process is so intimate, and I'm really glad you're here. Me too. So I-I was thinking that, um... I want to deepen the work that we're doing with the character that you're gonna play. Do you want to name her? Oh, I... I thought of a name. - What? - Zia. - Zia? - Yeah. That is... It's really powerful. You know, one of the ways that we could maybe... sort of make Zia more concrete would be... I was thinking we could explore the dream that you were telling me about and maybe act it out. - Dream? - The one that you... With the iron, and you slam your mom's hand. It's so just potent. - And I-I can't stop thinking about those images. - [Evangeline's voice overlapping] You know, dream work can be this really... Uh, anyway... - [chattering] - we should... try acting it out. - How do you feel about that? - [chattering continues] I, uh... - I guess, yeah. - Okay. - [boisterous chattering continues] - How did it go again? [Madeline] The day started out, we were in the car. She thought my friends hated me. - Are they bullying you? - She thought my friends were being mean to me. Are they being mean to you? Be silent. Great. You're hurting your mother. That's fine. One day you'll live to regret it. [imitates car engine racing] Well, look at me. You're looking at me like I'm crazy. Go play with your kittens. [imitates car engine racing] [whispering] [Evangeline whispers] At the beginning, between the mother. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Madeline, was that... Is that about how it felt? What? [whispering] I think we need to, um, emphasize the fractured, um, disjointed relationship with the mother at the beginning. - Okay. At the beginning. - Mm-hmm. [whispers] Hey. Come here. Yeah. Come here. - [sighs] - Try it. Just really look at its face. Look at its face. Really look. 'Cause you're gonna become that. [Madeline exhales] [laughs, gasps] Can you see? [Evangeline] Try to focus. That's right. Good. Great. Madeline! Stay in the center. [Madeline inhales, exhales] Madeline, where are you go... You're in the middle for this! [Madeline shudders, gasping] [breathing] [sharp breathing, gasping] [pig snorting] Madeline. Are you done, or should...? Is she done, or...? [panting, gasping] [exhales] [muttering] [stuttered vocalizing] Hello! [muttering continues] CK is one block south. Have you seen my daughter? No. I'm sorry, no. [Madeline, gruff voice] Oodles of noodles. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, brah, brah, brah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Let me get some noodles. Let me get some noodles. Go, go! Go, go! Go, go! Go, go! Go, go! Oh! Oh! Hi. How are you? How are you? I could really, really like that. - Hi. How are you? How are you? - [mutters, indistinct] [grunting, snorting] G-Go, go! Go, go! [grunting] Go, go! Go, go! [Madeline gasping] [mother] Yes, it's an emergency. Her prescription ran out a week ago. Mm-hmm. Y... Because she didn't tell me. I'm sorry. She's a teenager, so... She just doesn't tell me everything in her life. Honey. Honey, I have food. And a little present for you. - Okay, well, here it is. - [utensil clatters on plate] I'm leaving it here. Okay? There's... Maddie, maybe no rehearsal for a while. Right? 'Cause... [exasperated sigh] All right. Get it, or the cat'll get it. - [Madeline breathing] - You're gonna want to be on varsity. But you don't have to, you know. JV is for the younger guys too. You know? It's not, like, an embarrassing thing. That's what it's there for. Come on, honey. - [Madeline] And that lady over there? - [mother] Yes. - She's got cobwebs in her vagina. - Oh! Never say that about an older woman, because that'll be you. [laughing] It will be. It will be. - [Madeline] It already is! - [laughs] - Okay, look at... - Oh! See the middle one? Do you know what I'm gonna say? Yeah... Well, no. She's a lesbian. Well, she's actually not. I've seen her with a different man in this park, like, just walking. Not doing anything, but a different man, like, maybe six or seven times. [laughs] Just saying. Seriously. Oh, she gets with it? Yeah. I don't know what that is. I mean, you really... Let's look at her. Look at her. - Hey! - [gasps] Oh, my God. - [sputtering] - [laughs] Oh, God. Don't. Don't. Really sorry. Did I hurt you, hon? [breathing] [Madeline] Mom? Oh, God. I-I kissed thatguy. [laughs] - [horn honks] - [mother] Gosh. Uh, maybe we should have... Maybe we shouldn't have, like, rushed into something where there was quite so much responsibility. He could have herpes. He probably does. He knows a lot about porn. [chuckles] And that's a sign. All just, like, around your mouth, little pustules. Stop using that hand stuff. That just dries your skin out. - That only makes the whole thing worse. - I have allergies. No, you don't have allergies. You have hypochondria. Are you looking at Tinder? Is that what that is? Have you been snooping on my phone? - I-I-I... - Never trust anybody. Okay? - Can I get out now? - No, wait, I... - Make sure to choose the right... Okay. Excuse me. - [horn honks] Hi. Yeah. Okay. All right. Jesus. Have a good day! Good-bye! He's just doing his job, you know, and you just... [mother] You want to use protection. You want to be tested beforehand. Why would I get tested before? Okay, right. After. Um... and... Oh, honey, wait, wait, wait. Uh... [stammers] You know, I just... I want... I want you to be careful. You know? Because... you're not... - I'm not what? - Um... You know. You're not like the other people. - Because I'm black? - No. Madeline. [mocking] Regina. I just feel like you're maybe not ready, you know. - Your situation, which is different... - What are you saying? It's different from the other people in the... Everyone else is... is stable, and, um... You know, if you had an episode, which you probably will, what would happen? What, Evangeline is gonna... - Fuck! - You suck! [whispers] Just stop it. [chattering] - Hi. - Hi! You're here! Hi! - Sorry we're late. - No, no, it's good. It's good. No, you're here. Come on. Let's go. - How are you? - [Regina] She's so glad to have worked with you. Oh, we love her so much. We're so glad she's here. Can you get in your wardrobe right away? 'Cause KK's only got 30 minutes. [KK] Yeah, I have another set to be on. [Evangeline] Another set with Robert De Niro. Madeline. Are you all right, Mad? [man] Because if we did... You could use your fingernails on my back. That might be real, real good. It's like a nail file. KK, you could come too, baby. I could maybe get in there and squeeze your ass cheeks. - You ready for that? - [all chattering] Mom, you can come too, if you want to. [Evangeline] Let's start getting it together over here. [muffled] We'll put the... Hey. Hey. I was thinking about investing in a water bed. I heard it really makes the rock. KK, you look so great! Everyone's gonna love these posters. [chattering continues] [Evangeline] She... As soon as she's done, get her over here. That's, um, long-haired. Yeah. We can't... Can you... - Come on, sweetheart. - [cat screeching] Geez! Madeline, can you just, uh, please come over here with the animal? - I want to... - Yeah. Come on. We gotta get going here. - Thank you. - Okay. Great. [Evangeline] Just step right up here on this mark, honey. That's the best pig head ever. [Evangeline] Good. Okay, you guys look amazing. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. - Uh... - Oh, Mommy. Bad news. Um, do you know what? It might be great if you could just step out just for a minute. 'Cause I think it will just allow her to relax a little bit. Okay. I mean, I know it's, like, sometimes a thing with parents. This is her snack. She probably won't take it, but give it a try. - Okay, thank you. Thank you. - Yeah. [Evangeline] Uh, do you want this coconut thing? - [shutters clicking] - Okay. Great. Um... - [clears throat] - [Regina murmurs] Thank you. Oh, my God. - Okay. - [shutters clicking] Okay. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. My God. I feel like I haven't even got to talk to you yet. Are you okay? - I'm good. - Yeah? How's things with your mom? [sighs] On the way here, she tried to give me the sex talk. - [laughs] - I'm 16. I know everything. Are you kidding? Oh, my God. That is so... She just got the sex talk in the car. That's so weird, because we were just... [man] That's crazy. Hunter, you don't get to be a part of this conversation. That's so weird, because Laura was just telling us, and then we did that pi... It's so funny. Okay, let's shoot this. - Can you get me that stool? I wanna sit over here. - [woman] Okay. Sure. [Evangeline] Can you guys change positions, like... Yeah, yeah. Good, good. - [Hunter] You're on your game today, babe. - [Evangeline] Oh, yeah. Here. Hold on. This is just... You know what? It's weird, that sort of falling down. Can you just... Can we get the costume... - Do you know what? Fuck. Do you know what? - What is it? I-I love these costumes, and I know it's exactly what we talked about, but now that I'm seeing it all together, I'm just starting to feel like it's not... These costumes are from the prison theme. And I think now we're moving on to this whole mother-and-daughter theme... - I think I was wrong. Can we change? - What are you talking about? We've got two hot black chicks in space suits with big hats and a white cat. Fuck off. Fuck off. 'Cause I just need to get this... - [woman] What do you want to change? - Can you, uh... Let's just put them back into the clothes they came in. [Hunter] Oh, my God. Well, it's... Yeah. Can we try that? Do you know what? [whispering] Could you go and ask her mom if we could borrow her sweater for the shoot? - Yeah. - Thank you. - [shutter clicking] - [Evangeline] Okay, good. Um... [whispering] Madeline. Madeline. [clicking tongue] Just... You know what? Try... You know how you're really good at getting, like, emotional on cue? Just try one this time with, like, a lot of emotion. Any emotion? Yeah, like, um... I mean, just like... Think about how you felt when your mom gave you the sex talk. Try that. [shouts] [Hunter] That's really fucking good. - [shouting continues] - More! Yes! Yes! Now just less. I mean, just like a little... That, but subtle. More subtle. Uh... Okay, wait. Hold on. Hold on. I don't know. Maybe, just, I didn't understand what you were... Okay, do you know, uh... What if it made you feel kind of sad? Like just thinking about what it means for her, and it was, like, a lot more... Depressed? Yeah. Let's try that. Let's try that. Just... Just... Just for the photograph. Okay? [shutter clicking] Is that... That's depressed? A little bit more. More, more, more. Oh, good. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Good, good, good, good! That's so good. [shutter clicking] Okay, great. Can you turn and say something to KK? [Hunter] Yeah, KK. Perfect. [whispering] [shutter clicks] [laughs] Oh. [shutter continues clicking] [beeps] Regina, could you come in here for a second? I have an idea, and I was thinking... [clears throat] Um... I would love it if you would just pose with Madeline for a minute and then... 'Cause you're not... You won't be on camera. - The two of you together... - Oh, my... We won't see you. You won't be on camera. You'll be off. - Can you give her her sweater back? - Yeah, sure. - Just give her her sweater. - This sounds like a great idea. Okay, good. Good, good, good. - Just... Um... - Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, great. And then, um, I'm just thinking, like, we'll just get you and your mom and something like a little less powerful, a little kind of more just... I don't know, but, uh, do you know... Actually, you know what? Let's have you sit right here. So you're just looking at each other. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh! [chuckles] [Hunter] Don't worry about what I said about the water bed. I know, I know. It's been... [man] We've been workshopping for months. I'm not sure this is turning into a play. [Evangeline] It is a play. It's not a play play. It's just not about making sense all the time. I don't know if you really need me. - You know, it's the story... - A lot of us are barely in this anymore. Right. You know, actually... You're mostly using Madeline and KK. We all are in... You're part of this collective. But if you... If you go now, what's that going to say to everybody else? So let's get ready for doctors and nurses. Um, why don't you just stay for today? Now, who's, um, gonna play the patient? Ooh, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll do it. Madeline, you want to do it? I'm okay. Mm-hmm. [chattering, laughing] [woman] I'm ready and waiting to go. - Come on! - [chattering continues] Doctor? Doctor. Yeah, I'd like to do the improv with the same characters and maybe try to generate text and this time in a psychiatric ward, okay? Okay. What seems to be the problem? I'm sick. Yeah? What do you have? I'm de... Pregnant. Oh. With, uh... [Evangeline] Hey, Madeline. It's a psychiatric ward, not a pregnancy ward. My mom wants me to have an abortion, but, um, I'm gonna keep the baby. Wh... I mean, do you... Do you think you're... you're ready? I think I'm ready. I... I want to take care of someone. Like she will. But I'm afraid that the birth will be horrible. How will it be horrible? Bloody and hard. What if the baby doesn't wanna come out? What if it's, like... [screaming in pain] [gasps] [gasps] And it dies inside of me. Let's take five minutes, and then we'll, uh, regroup and try some more. Okay. - [man singing, faint] - [chattering] [woman] Do I have a weird time? Yeah. [chuckles] Hey. It's just me. I was just saying hi. Oh, are you okay? Just ready to give birth, I guess. [Evangeline] Yeah. Look, if you want to be there with all the family, fine. I'll... That's fine. No, I said it's fine. Hey. - Hello? - [siren wailing] Hello! Can I just talk about next week's rehearsal? Hey, guys. Where are you going? Where are they all going? - [man] See ya. Have a good one. - See ya. - Um... - Guys! Where... - I let everybody go. - What? Hey, guys! Guys! We're not done rehearsing. No, no, we are! We'll catch you next time! Madeline! Regina. Hi. Yeah. It's Evangeline. We, um... We finished rehearsal early, and so we were calling to see if it would be all right with you if, um, Madeline came to my house for dinner tonight. And then you wouldn't have to come back and pick her up, and I could... I could drop her off at, like, 9:30 or 10:00 or... - [sirens wailing] - Yeah, I hope that's okay. Everyone's leaving now. So I think I will just take her home and... Do you want to say something to her? On the message. [subway train passing] [chattering, faint] [chattering] Aw! - M... Madeline. That's my husband George. - Hi. You know what? - [chattering] - Everybody? Madeline's a really great actress. Yeah. She's applied to a whole bunch of really fantastic colleges like Juilliard and NYU. - [cheering, applauding] - [woman] Yay, Madeline. Yeah. I-I really don't know if I'll get in though. She's amazing. She could get into any college that she wants. If Evangeline says it, it's true. [George] Look what I've got for you guys! Here we come, here we come, here we come. - Better be good. - Come on. Who said that? Who said that? You know I'm the one who said it. One for you, girl? Okay, good? Mama, I do that for you. What about you, sweetheart? I'm a vegan. Vegan. All right. All right, vegan. I'm-a put this down here. I'm-a take you out bread. - Do you want some bread? - No, thank you. Okay, I'm-a leave you alone. Listen, guys. I'm-a be right back in a minute. [woman] Madeline was telling us your show is about prison? Uh, no. No, it's not. It's... It's a metaphor. - Metaphor? - No, it's not a metaphor. It's-It's, um... It's about mental illness. - And-And... - Wow. Madeline is the lead. I'm really interested in people who are out of control of their circumstances. Yeah. [wind blowing] - [excited chattering] - Oh, my God. Come here. [laughing] [women chattering] Welcome to the nut show! - [man] Oh, no. Don't! - [applauding] - [screeching] - What? Nut is a peanut because they pee a lot. Jason, no! - Okay. - [shouts] A nut... [shouting]...can kill you! - Em... - [cheering] [Evangeline] You can't do that. You're making a huge mess here, and you really can't stand on the couch, all right? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. - [man] Give me a smile. [woman] Probably just a little tired. That's okay. It's all for you, sweetie. Where's Solomon? - [chattering] - [man] Come here. [woman] Don't worry about it. [woman] Really? That's it? [Madeline] Hey. Are you Evangeline's daughter? Blessings for the one that's on the way... [partygoers] Aw! and hopefully will grow into an incredible host like Mom and Dad. [woman] Yes. This is for Evangeline and George. - Yes. - Yes. - To future baby. - Beautiful baby. [man] Go ahead. Next we're gonna... - [partygoers] Aw! - The future of enjoying family and friends. [Evangeline] To the right. Are you sure you're okay to... To go to the bathroom by myself? Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. Smile. Hi, Onur. [woman] You guys need help with cleaning up? - What? - It was like pig face. - Pig face? - Yeah, like pig face. You know, like... [laughing] I'm gonna get me some more vino. My, what soft skin you have. I won't tell Evangeline. [woman] It's showtime. Showtime. Showtime. [cheering] Whoo! [woman] I don't know. [man laughing] Okay. Oh. Oh. Oh! - Ooh! - [laughs] [meowing, purring] [woman laughing] Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.

She's not that old. Mama, Mama. Mama. [laughing, shouting] - [door closes] - [liquid pouring] - [George] Hey. - Hi. - Hey. Mad... Made... - Madeline. Madeline. Right. Right. - George. - Yes. [laughing] - How are you? - I'm okay. How are you? Doing great. - You're really talented, you know? - Oh. - Thanks. - Yeah, you're welcome. - [hisses, laughs] - [water sloshing] - You need anything? - So... Oh, no. - You good? - I'm okay. You need anything? [laughs] No, I got it. I got it. - They always leave it for me to clean up. - Hmm. Uh-huh. So, um, how long have you and Evangeline been together? Oh. We've been together five years. Five beautiful years. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. That's funny, because she has never mentioned you. She hasn't? - Nope. - [laughing] That's my wife. [laughing] That's my wife. Um... I am so happy I came to this party. - I'm glad you came too. - Yeah. Had a good time? So great. [laughs] Mmm. We enjoyed having you. - You sure you don't need anything? - Yeah. Okay. There's more juice in the fridge. - I could grab you some juice or something. - I don't need any juice. Okay. So, um, it's my birthday this weekend. Are you serious? Well, happy birthday. You're turning... - Seventeen. - Seventeen. And do you know what I am doing for my birthday? Mm-mmm. I'm going to lose my virginity. [chuckles] [nervous chuckle] That's... That's great. That's great. Who's... Who's the... [laughs] Um, who's the lucky guy? - I haven't decided yet. - Okay. You know, if you have any recommendations for, like, a position or anything, for... 'Cause I'm a beginner, you know. I was thinking that I could bend over, and he could squeeze my ass cheeks. - [giggling] - [door opens] Whoa. Hey. Were you drinking at my house, Madeline? Because you're not acting like yourself. You don't know myself. I am being myself. I do know you. I know you! Are you insecure? - What? - Are you... insecure? I don't know! No. I mean no. I'm so... I'm not insecure. I'm trying to do something that's really hard. And I am, you know, holding down the fort on the whole project, and I'm spearheading this very collaborative vision that is fucking just... kind of fucked. So, yes. I mean yes, I'm insecure, because I don't know if the project's gonna work. I don't even know if my fucking marriage is gonna work. And I don't... - Good. - What? What's good? That you admitted it. I'm insecure too. It's why I want you to like me so much. I don't think... I don't think I should be in your project anymore. What? Okay. I feel like, you know, we're... I think you might be right, Madeline. I think maybe you shouldn't be in the project. And actually, it feels like a huge relief. I mean, I... Of course, I want you to be in it, but... [sighs] this doesn't feel like it's good for either of us. - [gasps] - [tires screech] What was that? What... Was it a cat? I don't know. Maybe it was nothing. Should... Should we check on it? - No, it's dead. - Oh. [car horn honking] [children shouting] [wings flapping] [chattering] [chuckles] [phone line ringing] [ringing continues] [Evangeline on phone] Hey, Madeline. We didn't see you at rehearsal today. We hope you're okay. - Mmm. - [meows] [kissing] Mmm. Mmm. [Regina] Madeline? Are you coming downstairs? Someone's here to see us. [Evangeline] Madeline, is that you? My God. Last time, um, they left out the mint lemon. I don't know why. As if I couldn't do it. Just put a tent up. What did I do? Nothing. But it's usually a lot more than just putting a tent up. Right. Our board member Christa, that's her favorite, first of all. So are the... Are they... Oh. Oh. Madeline. Look who's here. - Hi, Evangeline. - She came to ask about you. - Hi. - We've just been talking about, um... - Your mother's been telling me about her... - The tent. - The tent. The event tent. - Which you get because it's... Yes. It's, like, um, you know all about that. You know, just... Yeah, I mean I guess it's kind of the same. She said that you said you were pregnant? - And I told her... - Well, just in the improv. absolutely, of course not. You're a virgin. You've never even kissed a boy. We've really missed her. I mean, she is amazing. You're an amazing actress. And just the capacity to go, you know... She has a lot of depth, and I'm sure it runs in the family. Yeah? I think so too. I mean, it might even be great to just sort of have you... Do you act? - Do you want to try something? - [laughs] Just, like, as a part of the workshop, we could... Oh, my goodness. Um... [laughs] [Regina] I wonder what the plan is. Do you think... Is it that she saw something about me? You know, because we were talking for a long time there, and... She is really freckly, which is something she'll want to watch out for, you know? I hope she gets every one of those things checked, because it only takes one. I wonder if she's on top of that. - Hi. - Hi, Regina. Everybody remember Regina? I invited her to join us today. - Hi! - Hi. [chattering] [Evangeline] Great, okay. So, let's, um... Let's rotate, and let's have a new leader. Regina, you want to step up front and be the leader? Come on. It's fun. Okay. - I don't know what to do. - [chuckling] [laughing] Just kind of what... [Evangeline] Just make any kind of ordinary, normal gesture that feels natural to you. - Pretend nobody else is here. - Just... - [laughs] - [all laughing] - Can I touch my purse? - Sure. - Okay. - [all] Okay. - [chuckles] - [all chuckling] [Evangeline] Great. See how relaxed that was, everyone? Just that relaxed gesture. [chuckling] - Nice. - [chuckles] But what kind of, like...? - Because I did that. - Yes. Okay. Uh... - That does always come... [laughing] - [laughing] [Evangeline] That was so great. Thank you. That was fantastic. [chattering] [woman] Hey, we're gonna clown your mom, so just copy her walk and gestures and stuff. - You can sit down if you want. - Okay. Just go one at a time. Do you want to go next? [laughing] [chuckling] You really shouldn't use hand sanitizer like that. It dries out your skin. Oh, what sweater should I wear? The one with floral or the one with floral? [laughing] The mood swings. They can be so bad sometimes. High, low. You never know where you're gonna go. [chuckles] Throwing things, hitting me. But I love you no matter what because you're my daughter. Were you smoking? I can smell it on you! Go take a shower, for Christ's sakes. Do you want some pancakes? Pancakes! I know you hate butter. Yes. Will you eat anything? Anything? See, Damon eats. Damon fucking eats. And he keeps it in. You're not going to rehearsal on Friday if you don't eat these pancakes. When you were a... just a little baby, I stroked your head so soft. I-I... I said to myself... I said, "This baby, she's so perfect. She's gonna be so strong." And look at you now. You are sick. You are so sick that you... No, Madeline. Madeline, no. Madeline, you're scaring me. [sobbing] Damon, tell her to... Put it down! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! My hand! My hand! [screaming] [crying] [sniffles] [Evangeline] Wow. [sniffles] [Evangeline exhales slowly] Wow. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That was so great. That was so amazing. - Oh, my God. Are you okay? - Yes. You're so good. That was amazing. Did you guys see that? Oh, my God. That was amazing. Wow. Oh! Wow. I, uh... This... This is the play. This is immersive theater. [gasps] Wow. Okay. Okay. [laughing] I was thinking we were gonna do something else, but I think that, in light of this powerful new work, we should, uh... Let's everybody pick a piece, just a section of the improv that Madeline just did, and then we will make a dance. Make a dance of it and, um... When you talk about this being the play, is this about Madeline? Well, no, no. I mean, it's about a character that we've been work... you know, creating together called Zia. - It's about a character. - And it's Madeline's story. No, Zia. - Her name is Zia. - Zia. And she's comfortable with that. You're comfortable with that? - [phone buzzing] - With us telling your story? - [buzzing continues] - I mean... So you're going to tell the story of the inside of her brain. [buzzing continues] Yes. Okay. What? You know, I'm just saying. I mean, you, right? And her. - I mean, just, like, think about the optics of... - I... Yes. It's her story. It's also my story. It's everyone in this room's story. [phone buzzing] We could keep talking, but I think we could put it in the work. Okay? - So, I think we have about 20 minutes. - [sneezes] - Bless you. - I'm so sorry. - Excuse me. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - We have about 20 minutes? Twenty minutes? - Yeah, we have 20 minutes. - About 20 minutes. Get together in groups of three, and, uh... and we'll reconvene. - [phone buzzing] - Okay? This is... Sorry, I have to take this. Okay. Yeah, so we should, um... [Evangeline] Yeah, no, I just wanted to tell you... - Um... - Sorry. I know I'm supposed to meet you there, but I-I'm still here. I just... Yeah, uh... Does anyone want to join our group? How you doing? [Evangeline chatters, faint] [woman exhales] - [woman] Hmm. - [man] Hmm. [various members] Hmm. - [man exhales] - [woman] Hmm. [members humming tone] [humming continues] I know you feel it's urgent. It's not urgent. [humming continues] [gasping] [humming grows louder] [chuckles] [chanting, whooping] [Evangeline] I'll callyou back, okay? Bye. [doorknob rattling] Guys! Guys! Open the door! [chanting, clapping] Guys! Open the door. Just... Wait. Oh, God. [groaning] Okay. Okay. Ugh. Fuckers. - Max, what the fuck? - Hey, sorry. - Come down here and open the door. - I can't. - I can't let you in just yet. - What do you mean, you can't? You're my assistant. - I know, but we need to talk, okay? - What are you wearing? - You take that. - You want a sweater? And take that. - Wear the mask. - Okay. Wear the mask. Yes. Give me the line, but two weeks ago. - What about the whiskers? - What? - Whiskers! - No whiskers. Aaah! [metallic groaning] She's coming. She's coming. She's coming. - You ready? - Ready. - Right there. - Okay. - Somebody get the lights. - I'll get 'em. - Okay. - [clattering] [Regina's voice] It's a long road getting to here, to you, and, um... I made pancakes! Pancakes! Honestly, I think what she's taking isn't working at all. Maybe we could make a plan. I think what she's taking isn't working at all. - [voices overlapping] - Have you been smoking? [purring] [voices overlapping] Madeline! It'sjust me! Hello! [metallic groaning] - [chattering loudly] - [shouting] D... Madeline! - Stop it! - Good! [gasps] - [screams] - [screams] Jesus. Give me that. Give me that! - Give it to me. - [screaming] [crying] [woman wailing] Madeline! - [laughing] - Stop it! - Stop! - [laughing] Get off me! Madeline? [grunting] Madeline. Madeline. Great job. You know, you're obviously taking a lot of risks, and I... - [hissing] - think you're so talented, you know? But if we're gonna collaborate, I think we should talk about a process that's a little more... - [purring] - Listen. This is done. I think this is done now. Okay. Everybody? Everybody, I think this is done now! So thank you very much, everybody! Great job. Hey! [gasps, panting] Just stop! Stop! No! [panting] [screaming] [panting] - [voices overlapping] - It's a miracle. [Evangeline shouts] [wind blowing] [woman whispers] Mother. [Madeline exhales] [car horn honking] [subway train passing] [brakes squeaking] [birds chirping]
