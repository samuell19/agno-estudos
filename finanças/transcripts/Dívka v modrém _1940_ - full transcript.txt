FILMEXPORT HOME VIDEO Presents Lida Baar Oldrich Novy in a comedy GIRL IN BLUE Story by Screenplay by Directed by Starring with Director of Photography Production Designer / Music by Sound by / Edited by Assistant Director Film Studios / Sound System Production Manager Surprisingly many are interested. Auction should be easy. No wonder, Pstross family was always wealthy, these are all rare items. But a mere fraction of them is for sale. All the rest was taken over by the new owner, Earl Landa. I'm only surprised he wants to live in such an old castle. Gentlemen, I feel creepy around here. - Why do you feel creepy? - It's all so mysterious here. - Come on, don't start again. - Really, Pacovsky, just last evening I read that... - Enough! - How are you, Castellan? - Ah well. Are you frowning just at me, or at everything in general? At you, Notary, as well as in general. But dear Castellan, you haven't the slightest reason. You wouldn't be frowning at me simply for auctioning Earl's estate? - You'll keep your job. - But I have to part with all that I love the most. I took such care of this. Such a beautiful painting. Just a painting. It's nothing comparing eternity. Ah well. Who drew the curtain again? One still has to guard it. Good day, sir. My regards, madam. Excuse me, sir! My regards, madam. It seems that not only antiquities are being auctioned today. Look, Sally, what a coincidence. - Yes, mother. - You should greet him. - Good day. - Good day, Miss. - Mrs. Sad. - Don't call me that, I beg you. You know that I got divorced because of that name. I don't want to be Sad. Call me Mrs. Rosie. Or just Rosie, when we'll be alone. As you wish, madam. Rosie. - Sad. - God, I'd give anything to change my name and be Sad no more. But of course Mr. Karas will like it. Sally is shy to show her new dress to you. The poor girl is worried that you may not like it. - So, show how much they suit you. - Very nice. You see and you were so shy in front of Mr. Karas, you, you, you. His wealth is really irresistible. We have to keep an eye on him. But that's Wanda! Really, Wanda herself. Look at the resemblance, it's incredible. Castellan, who painted it? Some unknown painter about three hundred years ago. - Are you interested in Girl in Blue? - I like her, I'd buy it. Oh, a very rare artwork. Look at the color. The composition. A masterpiece. And there's more to it! - That painting is also cursed. - Cursed? - But it's only a rumor. - Yes, a rumor. Yes. And the fact that our old Earl died among merry girls after drinking too much wine is also a rumor only. But the truth is that I found him collapsed underneath this painting. On the same spot as his father, grandfather and great grandfather. And all had vampire teeth marks on their necks! - Nonsense. - Come on, who would believe such things. - In our time. - Gentlemen, do not speak so. It is scientifically proven that unknown, unearthly powers exist. - I just read yesterday... - Starting again?! The efforts to materialize the soul are well documented. - Just to spook the kids. - I do believe. It's a matter of taste. But then... That painting is surly cursed. Four thousand and five hundred,... sold for 4,500. Number 560. - Girl in Blue. - Twenty thousand. Twenty thousand. No-one? Take it back. Tough luck, Notary. The painting was not sold, so you have to take it for safekeeping until the young Earl arrives. I don't even know whether it will fit through my door. These life-size paintings. And excuse me, Castellan, you said a..., a vampire? Yes. - From that painting? - Of course. I think you should not remain alone in the room with that painting for long. You know, these secret powers are unpredictable. - Science makes mistakes. - That's a matter of opinion. I just wanted to warn you, have a safe trip. And were you afraid when the painting was here? Afraid? There you go. Thesis on vampires - Anybody there? - Pacovsky here. Are you scared of your vampire yet? No. Why should I be scared? He's not roaming around yet. At least I haven't noticed. In the evening? You bet I'll come. I'm looking forward to it. Come in madam, Mr. Karas is in the study. Mr. Houzvicka, please do not tell Otylia that I'm here. She doesn't like me. As if it was my fault that he fell in love with me. You know he is so shy and afraid to tell me. And when Mrs. Smrcinska comes with Sally and I'm so lucky that she surely will, then you have to help me. - Good day, madam. - Good evening, Mrs. Otylia. - Is Mr. Karas home? - In the study. - We're lucky then. Don't tell Mr. Houzvicka that we're here, he doesn't like us. Don't mind him, madam, he lives just for his office. Please, I beg you, do it for me. I didn't unveil the picture yet. Ah, Mr. Karas. And Mrs. Sad. - Of course. - What a pleasant visit. You know, Mr. Karas, Sally has been telling me tales about the painting. She's so sensitive. She begged me to come and have a look at it. I told her we shouldn't bother you and waste your time. But I see you're wasting it already. He needs some distraction from all his problems. That's not even nice how much he's been distracted. Since he has that huge painting in the study, he's been playing cards every night, he should get married. I must admit, my dear ladies. I cannot keep myself at home in the evening. It seems I'm scared to be alone with that painting. I'd be scared with you, if you'd let me. What a coincidence, Sally loves being scared. She's been like that since childhood. That comes in handy. Sally, you may remain scared with Mr. Karas for a while here. I'll be back in half an hour. - Yes mother. - Mr. Karas, I entrust you with my child. I know I can be calm when she's in your hands. - Good bye. - My regards. - Are you also going Mrs. Sad? On the contrary. I'm looking forward to take a seat. Well, hello then. - What should I be scared of? - A vampire. I've never seen a vampire. - How does he look? - Ladies... Ladies, you shouldn't joke about such things. Just yesterday I read that... Enter. I thought someone was knocking. I heard it too. See, no-one again. What happened, my dear? Come to the kitchen, I'm baking some pastries. What are you doing here, Houzvicka? I wanted to ask you whether you'll still need me today? - You may go. - Thank you, good night. He could scare me silly. If I could get scared. - Alone at last. - Excuse me? I was just thinking, we've known each other for quite long. And this is the first time I'm alone with you in your apartment. - Dear lady, forgive me. - I'd forgive you anything. But please, show me that Girl in Blue. Then we won't be alone anymore. Well then, if the lady wishes, I shall do it. - But if something happens! - I won't abandon you. You know, only here one gets to understand you. That mysterious painting! And those books. - Books everywhere. - Beautiful! Well, some say so about me. What are you reading? May I have a look? A romance. Are you interested in love? I like reading about it. - God, what a beauty. - I'd say so. You know what? Come here. Sit down, listen and I'll be reading to you. Dear lady, I have to warn you that I fall asleep at every lecture. - Not with me. - We'll have a nice, dark hour. - But I'll fall asleep, madam. - Again "madam"? - Well, Rosie. - I'll certainly fall asleep. - I'm not worried about that. - Where did you stop reading? - Just a moment. Here. - Oh, how much I love you. - Excuse me? - I'm reading. - Ah. Oh, how much I love you, I cannot live without you. Do you know? Sometimes I feel such passion that it causes me pain. But pain of love does not hurt much. I'm your lover and I'd like to be your servant. You're my master, you're my dream come true. You're kind, you're beautiful, you're wise and strong. What happened? Vampire! That was a vampire! - Hello! Give me Dr. Pacovsky, but quick! - What's the rush? - Why are you here when I'm phoning you? - Why are you phoning me when I'm here? Excuse me, but I'm so upset that I don't know what I'm doing. - One can see that. - Calm down now and tell me what happened. It's horrible and strange, but I was just bitten by a vampire! - Who? - A vampire has just bitten me. - The one hanging in my study. - I think you have a fever. - See? Vampire teeth marks. - Where? - Oh dear, oh dear. - You see. What do you say? What should I do?! You have to somehow rid yourself of the vampire's grip. We'll help you, don't worry. Have a nice evening, gentlemen. Good evening, don't let me disturb you, I'm coming to pick up Sally. - Was she a hassle? - Not at all, she's been eating pastries the whole time. She was so scared, my dear. Good bye. Good night. The vampire has left. We're safe for now. - Were you scared? - Yes, mother. - Of whom? Why? - A spooky vampire. - A spooky vampire. - Isn't she cute? - You think it wasn't a vampire? No. It was the young lady. Well. Well then... Blanka cannot be a vampire. It's all plain rumor. Friends, I must admit that I fell in love. - With whom? Countess Blanka of Blankenberg. That is the real name of a Girl in Blue. Quiet, you stupid, three hundred year old painting is no competition for you! Be it a vampire or not, I like her. - Good night, gentlemen. - Mr. Houzvicka, do you like your master? - A lot. If you really like him, then prevent Mrs. Sad from coming here too often. I know you favor her and I don't ask why. - She's so pretty. - There are prettier. And Mrs. Sad has no good intentions with your master. - She does want to marry him. - You see, she doesn't mean well. And you have to help us. To your Girl in Blue. Tough luck for you today. That signifies deep love. Platonic perhaps. - Or is Mrs. Sad involved? - No! I haven't seen her for about fourteen days. I can't free myself from my Girl in Blue. I'd never believe that a painting may have such a suggestive influence. God, if it was possible to breath life into a body that lived hundreds of years ago. You'd shy to approach her anyway. Hello, Dr. Pacovsky. Who? Good evening. Yes, yes, I'm coming right away. Excuse me, dear friends, I have to attend a patient. There's a flu epidemic raging these days. - Let me not disturb you, I'll be back. - Not a chance, I'm going home. - I can hardly keep my eyes open. - Me too. I'll go with you. Good night and my regards to Countess Blanka. And don't forget to give her a good night kiss! I'll never tell you anything again. And if I wasn't so dizzy, I'd also think up a story about you, but now... - Good night. - Cheers. Mr. Houzvicka, what are you doing here so late? Weren't you working? I just wanted to catch up on my outstanding duties. - No time for them during the day. - So, you've got your duties settled? What will you do without your duties? - New will be coming up. - That's more like it, Houzvicka. - Have a good sleep. - Good night. Always someone walking around here. Blanka, my beautiful Girl in Blue. If you only knew, how much I love you. I know that you can't hear me and thus I dare to say this. I love you with all my heart. I promise I won't disappoint you and you can't disappoint me. You're just a picture, a mere dream. You have no caprice or faults of a living woman. You're not a dressy girl, you do not slander or squabble. And you don't cry for a trifle. And even if you besot some youngster, you cannot be unfaithful to me, when I'm in the office. You'll never be grumpy when I'll be up to mischief. And your kind smile won't disappear in five hundred years, once you'll be flaking already. You see how wise my words are. You're an ideal, life-long lover. Thank you for the kiss that has brought me back to life. Excuse me. Who may you be? I'm Countess Blanka of Blankenberg. I had no peace in my grave. Who is my savior? I shouldn't drink. I really shouldn't drink. I'm not sleeping in my bed. Then I'm surely awake. But I'm seeing ghosts. That's not funny! That's not funny, Karas! The best thing is to sleep on it. Or maybe have a drink on it. Do not leave me. I'm scared to be alone at night. Come closer, my lord. What is your name? - Doctor Jan Karas. - Doctor? - You're not of a noble family line? - No. Actually, when I was searching for my ancestors, I found a nobleman in my family tree, the Knight from Boritov, but that was about it. Then we are tied in blood. My uncle, Maximilian of Blankenberg has devote his life to Elenor Boritov. - Really? I guess that would fit. During a feast Albert of Wallenstein, the Duke of Frydland, lead me to dances. You, Miss, danced with Albert of Wallenstein? Do you realize that three hundred years had passed since? Why are you crying, Miss? Is it something I said? I'll do anything, just please don't cry. I hate seeing that. I thus reached the age of three hundred and eighteen. Three hundred and eighteen is a lot. Oh, how ancient I have become. Ancient? That's really good. If you only knew how great you're looking. You're just saying that. No girl is a match for you, my dear Girl in Blue. You've been a busy student of sweet talk. Your words I trust not. Present me with a looking-glass. A looking-glass... Ah, a mirror. Here. The light here is very dim. - Light a candle. - Excuse me, I forgot. Oh, what magics you master! - I feel panic creeping upon me. - It's electricity and no magic. - E...? - ... lectricity. - What is that? - Well, electricity. That's when you... It's a power of... It's like, a hundred candles. Thou can light one hundred candles in one blink? You're a warlock. And that is why you had the power to set me free. Master Jan, I beg thee kindly, do not turn me into a picture again. I shall serve thee for ever. For ever? Well, I think that won't be necessary. - I couldn't ask that of you. - No! You've set me free. Do with me as you please. Here I am. Well, Miss, just to set things straight. I have nothing personal against you. But you cannot stay here. I'm a Notary. A respected citizen of Lucin. And a bachelor among other things. - That is interesting. - I couldn't have a girl in my apartment, that all of a sudden came out of a painting. Ancient people were more hospitable. Well, they were ancient after all. Countess, I beg you, return to your frame. Just imagine, such a young girl. Three hundred and eighteen years old young girl cannot live with me. What would the people say? What would the preservationists say! Shall you not invite me to sit with you? - My feet hurt from standing in the frame. - Forgive me, here. So simple is your residence. Where are the rich decorations? Are you that poor? It will be difficult to exchange the riches of my castle for this. And that's what I don't want. Come, let me show you the way to the frame and I promise to remember you for ever. - What foul things you speak. - You will always... What do you mean? I'm the only one here. Where's the rest? Forgive me, I dared not, we know each other for a while only. - Just think, think of my clients... - All in vain. I shall live with you in your house, since I'm your property now. - That's not true. You're a part of an inheritance inventory and no-one was willing to pay the price for you! Now you know it. So many fair lads are longing for me. They were, three hundred years ago. One should behave with respect to a lady. - Whom do I belong to then? - To the new castle owner. - Earl Landa. - How? And how dare you kiss what's not yours? It's because you're my, my grand..., grand..., grand-aunt. You see? And how could you throw your relative out onto the street at night? Not out, I meant the frame, you're used to it. - Enough talking. - Take me to your bed. - My bed? What a beginning. You can sleep here. - Is this supposed to be a bed? - Why not? It's quite comfortable. What do you know about comfort. What poor people you are, to spend a third of your life in such unfitting and unsightly bed. Old Bohemian bed, what a wonderful dwelling. You approach it by stairs. On carved pillars a damask canopy, with decorative fringes. Three quilts on the bottom and four laid on top. And a heap of pillows. - That wouldn't fit here. - A plain bed indeed. Where is my honorable place by your side? You don't think that you and I, together... As your guest I have the right to sleep by your side. You won't get out of this. - Acting surprised at common habits? - Well lookie here, common habits. Maybe ages ago, but not anymore. We are more virtuous these days. We're shy. No need being shy when ill intention is not present. But I understand your disconcertment. Since you have such uncomfortable bed. Where's your maid or a squire? I can't wake Otylia that late and Houzvicka does not live here. - Then you shall help undressing me. - But how... I? That won't do. I cannot get undressed alone. Cannot you handle a ladies dress? Hurry, how long shall I wait? You're not very accommodating. Where will I put it? Where will I put it? Fashion Salon - Good day. - Good morning. - May I help you? - I need clothes. Clothes? I'm sorry, but we do not sell men's fashion. - But I want a ladies dress. - Ah, that's different then. - This way please. - Thank you. Have your pick. We have many beautiful dresses. - It should be for an older lady, right? - No, a younger one. - Young. How old approximately? - About three hundred and eighteen. - I beg your pardon? - Er. Twenty two. Twenty two. We'll pick something very elegant. - An evening dress or casual? - No, not casual. Something for morning as well as for the afternoon. - I get it, something practical. - And very discreet. Here, this would do. Avery elegant dress. - I guarantee the lady will like it. - She's a relative of mine. - A relative? On a visit? - Very sudden visit. I want to surprise her. Where's the zip? Here. I just need to know the size. - How tall is the lady? - Up to here about. - Up to your neck? - No, here. Then this one will do. And this little hat would go with it. Lovely, right? Well, it's not bad. - Good morning, Mrs. Otylia. - Good morning. - Is this the time to come to the office? - I'm just a little late. I see that. You're lucky, Mr. Karas is still sleeping. - Still sleeping, is he ill? - No, he's been partying again. I said he should get married. Good morning. The young sir overslept a little. Oh my! What a noise you cause in my chamber. Shrew. - What are you doing here so early? - Early? Too late, I think! All hell is breaking lose here. I'd never think that I will find in your room... ... a nude girl. Where's your decency, sir, what if the people get to know, what would they say? - Now, hold it! The people will get to know sooner or later. I don't understand why you make such a fuss. I slept on the sofa in my study. And if the girl slept on my bed naked, as you say, she was apparently hot and it's purely her business and none of yours. And I insist that you behave to that lady with a fitting respect! Because my niece Blanka is a Countess! Gee, I'm glad to hear that. All will be jolly around here. It surely will. And where did the niece come from? Well, she just came from... From Hellianda. Ah, from Hellianda. Who would have thought, such a decent gentleman. Jumping to conclusions again? It's his niece and she came during the night. - During the night, surprising. - Don't speak so much. One of us has to believe it. Good morning, Blanka. Slept well? The keyholder brought me some foul infusion. - It's coffee. - Co-ffee? I don't know that. Must be some magic potion. - I don't need it, I'm not ill. - That's breakfast. - This is supposed to be a breakfast? - Of course. Try it. The coffee is excellent, the butter is fresh. I was waiting three hundred years for this plain breakfast. You want to starve me to get rid of me. Only a relative can do that. But Blanka, I don't intend to hurt you anyhow. Today our lifestyle is different than three hundred years ago. If your entire life is like your bed and this breakfast, then I pity you. You're my dear guest and I want you to feel at home around here. - And I'll do all in my power for that. - What's your wish, sir? You'll prepare breakfast according to young lady's wish. Place your order. I wish nothing else than a simple, Old-Bohemian cuisine. I'd like a bit of soup, bacon and eggs, loaf of ham, bread, fruit and wine, red if possible. - You can bring more of that. - Miss eats that much for lunch? - No, for breakfast. - Finally a sensible mind. We want to look good for our men. Thin women are whiny, quarrelsome and jealous. A woman well fed is mercy and amiability alone. But I'm hungry now. Go and prepare the breakfast and bring it to the bath. Breakfast in a bath? I won't stay in this household! Do as the Countess ordered! Please, Otylia. - My bathrobe suits you. - I couldn't find anything else. - What have you done to my dress? - I brought you a new one. Look. This is how women dress these days. You want to dress me, Countess of Blankenberg, into such rags? From bad material. Where's the golden lining? Such a small and indecent dress. The skirt hardly covers knees. A harlot would not wear this. You cannot go out in that costume of yours. Are you reproaching me? Look at yourself! What a poor attire. How can one wear such pants? Are you hiding some leg disfigurement in those strange tubes? Tubes, well excuse me, this is the latest fashion. Excuse me. - Doctor Karas. - You don't have to repeat that to me. - Good morning. - You wished me that already. - Yes, I am at home. - I can see that. - The whole afternoon. - Because of me, how kind of you. - No, I didn't sleep well tonight. - Me likewise. No wonder on such bed. - No, no, don't come over here. - Why not? - I have important work to do. - Excuses, you're not doing anything. Hm, new fashion? This only fits for a masquerade. - I'll explain everything later. - Why later, tell me now. - And why you turn your back to me? - What do you think about me? Nothing good, actually. And why do you have that strange ladle on your ear when speaking to me? - Blanka, that's a telephone! Witchery again, are you summoning the devil?! - Hold on, I didn't finish. - I shall finish first! - The devil may wait! - But... Hello, Karas! Hello. What's going on over there? The line's not dead. Hello, Karas! Is the bath ready? Sure. Come, I'll take you there. It'll do you good. - I think not! - I just spoke to him over the phone. You suspect him and the poor fellow is working already. Good day, friends, what did you bring me? I'm so busy today. - Perhaps we should go downstairs. - But why? It's better here. - Someone's having a bath... - Who? Old lady Otylia. You might not believe me, but she always does that. So the old lady Otylia is having a bath. She always does that. I won't stay in this household! - Friends, I assure you... - Out with it! - Who's there? - Is this your love for the painting? - You debauchee! - I'll explain everything. - Jan! A second. - What do you want, Blanka? - My dress. Yes, at once. Here. I want my dress! - Who's that girl? - A relative of mine. - Where is she from? - From Hellianda. They wear it there. - Where from? - Hellianda. It's not here. You must be mistaken. Look, my ears hear things that are not for hearing sometimes. But you just don't know geography, that's all. Excuse me, I'm a studied man. - But how. - Yeah. Excuse me? Otylia, what would I do without you. - Otylia, if you only knew. - What happened? - The Countess... - What is it? - Nothing, but... Someone has to dress her. She said that you're very kind. - And the breakfast. - Did she like it? - But of course. - Let's go. May I help you? - What Hellianda? Where's that? - You don't know? They taught us in school. Allow me, Blanka, to introduce my best friends. Regional physician, Doctor Pacovsky. Forrest Engineer, Pavel Cadek. This is Countess Blanka from Boritov, my friends. You are Jan's physician? And where are your leeches? We do not need them anymore, we have medicaments these days. You're a quack then. And here's your simpler. - I'm a forest engineer. - A forest what? Engineer, Countess. You don't have forest engineers in Hellianda? What rude subjects you have. Without manners. They dare questioning nobility. You may leave. We do not need your service today. I'll call you in time. Oh, I've seen your servants already. When will you introduce me to your knights? Knights. How jolly. And I promise we will do our best that the Earl is content with our services. Thank you, Castellan. I promise you that I'll be righteous at all times, in order for you to serve me gladly, like during the time of the late Earl. Dear Castellan, please take care that all are properly invited to today's evening event. And mainly invite young ladies, so we do not die of boredom. I'm not sure whether you'll be satisfied in this respect. The only beauty in Lucin is three hundred years old. And she's in notarial custody, because nobody wants to buy her. You mean that cursed painting? I dare say that I described it as cursed, in order to prevent its sale. I adore that painting. - Earl could personally... - Next time. I'd like some living pictures in the mean time. Is the Notary's relative pretty? Nobody's seen her yet, I asked. - Do you know how old she is? - The Notary said that twenty two. That's why no-one has seen him lately. What an idea from that girl to come here. If she only knew how hard it is to find a husband in Lucin. Twenty two is dangerously young for some. - We don't mind, right, Sally? - No, mother. Friends, don't be angry with me. It's not my fault that she was like that. Be sensible. All right, I'll confess. But promise me you'll keep quiet. You know how, I see. Listen. Countess Blanka did not come from Hellianda. And neither is she my relative. She's Countess Blanka of Blankenberg, yes, the Girl in Blue. My kiss brought her back to life. She came out of the frame and out of thankfulness she stayed with me. It's the effect of unknown forces. - Materialization of an apparition. That's clear. - Absolutely clear. Nope, he has no fever. You're over worked, you need more sleep. I knew you won't believe. That's why I made up that Hellianda. Make of it whatever you want. But such things have to be proven somehow. From my point of view, a three hundred year old organism would have to experience some kind of changes. You're a modern man. Use science. Pulse is quite normal. Wait, this is a serious matter. Look at me. Eyes large. And clear. Eyebrows genuine. Hair grown, quite nice. Smile at me a bit. Teeth seem healthy. Surprising, surprising. - Stepping on your tongue? - Just a moment! The organism seems unchanged. Over the centuries. Where are you buried? - Let me rest in peace. - Ok, but tell me where you're buried, maybe we could find out more. - Leave at once! - Earl Landa sends his regards. - The New Earl? Show me. - Good day, Miss. - Countess. - Countess. - Good day. That's an invitation to an introductory dinner. You don't have to read it. I did it on the way here. Ladies are welcome, so Miss here... You're too talkative, Houzvicka, you may leave. Countess. Earl Landa. Finally a friend worth my social level. - How old is his family line? - I don't know, two hundred years. Only? What to do. - When shall we go? - There's enough time before evening. Good, I'll fix my hair a little. - I'll go and get you an evening dress. - What do you mean? You cannot go to Earl's party in this ancient dress. - Is it not rich enough? - I'm not saying that, but think about the company there. The Earl is very elegant. If Albert of Wallenstein wasn't ashamed, then Earl Landa and his two hundred year family line shouldn't too. Blanka, be sensible! Ladies will be wearing modern dresses, so you cannot go there dressed like a masque. You allow no joy for me and now you start being rude? I don't have to be here. I will leave. - Blanka, where do you want to go? - Home. Into the painting. Jesus, Blanka! Blanka, please do not go into that frame! - Stay with me! - Let go! I want to! - You'll never see me again! - Blanka! Don't go there. It's more secure here. As a painting you might become cursed again and you might have to spook. So be it! I want to! Farewell. Wait a while, Blanka. How could you do that to me? - Why do you want to leave? - Because... Because nobody likes me here. What are you thinking, Blanka? Don't you know how much I love you? You don't have to cry over that. Forgive me, I didn't want to hurt you. Blanka, I'll do anything you like. You'll go to the Earl as you are. It will blow over somehow. And now we will kiss and make up. Watch it, my collar will wrinkle. - Everything harnessed? - All is ready and waiting, my lady. How many horses? Two or four shall pull the coach? - Not four, but sixty. - Sixty? Please enter our coach. Do you like it? The coach is nice, but I see neither coachmen nor horses. Horses are inside and the coach drives on its own. On its own? I shall not entrust my life into your wicked hands. Find a different coach. With horses. Real horses. Well, that will be difficult. - Need a cab? - This way, Mr. Karas. This way, what a nice masque. Wake up, old man. You'll take us to the Earl. You see, Jimmy, I told you we'd ride again. Castellan, tell me something about that Girl in Blue. - Did you ever see the vampire? - Well then, my dear lady, it seems that the vampire is used to castle surroundings only. But it is certain that during important events the ghost of the Girl in Blue always appea... - Who's that? - Vampire! Vampire! Aren't you ashamed being drunk so early in the evening? Vamoose! She's beautiful. And she has a sense of humor. She dressed up to entertain us a little. I didn't know this was costume party. Please try to understand that this is how people dress nowadays. Welcome, Countess. Good evening, Mr. Karas, it is a pleasure to meet you. - It seems you're not local. - She is my relative from Hellianda. - She came for a visit yesterday. - How cute. Your quack and simpler have access to the ballroom? Quack and simpler? That was a good one, Countess. Your toothpick is on fire. - Charming woman. - Where is she from? - From Hellianda. - From Hellianda? - Hellianda? Where's that? But my dear, you don't know where Hellianda is? - Do you know the place, madam? - Not personally. But if my late husband was here, he'd know. He used to travel a lot. Are you saying that your husband visited Hellianda? Of course he did. He sent me postcard from there before he died. - Poor fellow. - But why that costume? We are not at a masquerade. That seems to be the latest model from Hellianda. Very nice. I'd like to try the collar. And what do you think about Hellianda, Professor? It's a well known, yet not fully explored country. People live and dress up there like hundreds of years ago. Live and dress? Poor Countess, she must feel so alone among us. Not a single soul to understand her. None of her kind. You're saying she's a Countess? That would interest me. I envy the poets in Hellianda that they have such beautiful women for inspiration. I wonder how many youths will duel over me tonight. What an idea. Should I inflame their passion? You could show your bravery. Please, just not that! Many people are astonished by you. - Are you enjoying yourself, Mrs. Sad? - Always when you're around. You have a beautiful evening dress. Where's it from? - From Hellianda. - From Hellianda? - I don't know that salon. - Go talk to Mr. Karas a bit, Sally. Yes, mother. Look how Smrcinska is forcing that tadpole of hers to the Notary. As a good relative, you should do something about that. There are others here that could make him happy. Keep calm, I shall protect him from them. Oh, we're being familiar? That's cute. I'll come to visit you. Good company seldom meets around here. I'm sorry. Jan and I prefer to be alone at home. Forgive me, I didn't know. Forgiveness granted. I don't like that Countess story. - Where did I see her? - Are you that interested? All men are wild about her and you too. - You're not paying attention to me. - That's also partly your fault, madam. - You like to aim high. - The higher, the better. To us remaining single for long. You have plenty of time. Confidentially speaking, I'll never get married. - Marriage is a sport for me. - If your mother heard you. Please don't tell her. She's very old fashioned. You're lucky, Reverend, that you didn't hear that child speaking about the seventh sacrament. - She maybe has a bad example at home. But since we're talking, Reverend, could you advise me? - Gladly. - Do you want to start a family? - I'd like to, but... I don't know, you have some experience from registries. Couldn't you tell me how it usually ends, when there is difference in age between spouses? - It depends on people. Who's older? - She is. By how much? It sometimes happens that even nine years do not matter. - And what about three hundred? - Three hundred?! Excuse me, but is that a joke? Sad truth, unfortunately. Excuse me. Countess, grant your humble subjects the permission to present the deepest bow to your beauty. Your robe is gaining much attention. Doctor Karas revealed to us that you're not from Hellianda, Countess Blanka of Blankenberg. But indeed you are the cursed Girl in Blue. Turn around a little, gentlemen. So that he doesn't see me. So, you want to make fun of me. It's enough. Uncle, take me away from here now! - I'm not playing that game more. - Not that loud. You wouldn't want to leave our friend to all those ladies. Let him do as he pleases. But I cannot lie to him anymore. I'm so ashamed when I see how much he believes me. The bubble will burst one day. And then he'll think that I was just trying to pinch him from the others. - Listen, aren't you jealous? - Don't laugh! - I'm being serious! - Wendy, we're still around! We will confirm that we've convinced you in order to help him. It's not your fault that you resemble the Girl in Blue. - Karas will understand. He's a joker. - It's not a joke anymore. Yes, he fell in love with me. Really. And what am I to do? And it leaves you indifferent? Admit it. Leave me alone. You're very nasty. How is it going, Doctor? Would you introduce me to the Countess? - Am I not disturbing? - Excuse me. - Not at all, Earl. The Countess was just telling us about the female ability to deceive men. Would you like to repeat that for me too, Countess? Sure. Gladly, if you wish. Excellent, we're being familiar. Why wait too long. Look, the Earl has fallen for your relative right away. - She should be careful. - You wouldn't want to ruin her luck. - She is as pretty as a picture. - You are right. A beautiful castle indeed. Reminds me of my father's place. Countess, your presence increases its beauty even more. You are fortunate that your uncle devised it on you. He never liked me and this was his last act of wickedness. How strange you speak, why wickedness? Do you know what it means to maintain fifty five rooms? I'll spend everything I have. This castle will ruin me. - And now he'll propose to her. - Wait till he finds out her age. Some twenty five, twenty six most. - And add a couple of hundred. - You're exaggerating. But do you know that she looks like that girl in the painting? - What painting? - That Girl in Blue. Resembles? Allow me to laugh. Want to bet? I'll come over and have a look. Great. Good bye. She's being unfaithful to me. Excuse me, Earl. Blanka, let's go. I knew not that you can dance. Thank you for your courtesy. - The next dance belongs to you. - Thank you, Countess. - Blanka, we're going home at once! - We shall dance first. I haven't danced for three hundred years. - Countess, may I? - I'm sorry, but I'm engaged. - Right, Jan? - Yes. - Could I invite you to dance? - The Countess is engaged. Give me your arm, Jan. Look at the way the Countess from Hellianda is dancing. From Hellianda? What nonsense is that! The Notary's relative from Hellianda, that unexplored country. Hellianda doesn't exist. You're lucky I didn't have you for geo! Forgive me, I didn't know you're dancing for the first time. I know how to dance, but this clumsy dress of yours. Don't worry, I'II lead you. What a disgrace. An undying disgrace. I'm a ruined man. I've lost my reputation. Respect, honor and clients are gone. I can't show myself out on the street without people pointing at me. I'm so unhappy. One that has not what he wishes for is unhappy. But one that has everything tends to be even unhappier. The only thing I can do is to pack up and leave for some Hellianda. My honorable and successful office will have to close down, because no decent person will ever... Go on and announce me. Did you hear? Someone's coming. What more do they want from me? Blanka, go to the bedroom for a while, please, so no-one sees you in that dress. I repeat, young sir, that the Notary does not wish to rent out a room, - I should know about that. - We know each other since last night. As you wish. Just hold on a second. - Excuse me, madam. - What is it? - You've got the wrong door. - I was actually looking for this one. - For you. - What? - I don't know you. - But I know you, Countess. I couldn't sleep the whole night. In the morning I found out I love you. I'm a son of the local pharmacist. I'll drown you in luxury. - We have to see each other often. - But sir! Stay calm, I'll organize everything. And not a word to your uncle, that would ruin everything. I'm sorry, sir, but I do not intend to rent out any room in this house. - Thank you, I'll ask another time again. - Your effort will be futile. - Perhaps you'll change your mind. - Not a chance! One never knows. - I'm going to visit the Notary in respect of... - Too late, sir. - The room is reserved. - We're not renting anything. We understand each other. But don't despair, you will be lucky next time perhaps. Good bye, madam. - I'm here because of the last will. - Come in, Mr. Kubelka. I'll get the Notary, he's in his study upstairs. Good day. And you are? I'm landowner Kubelka, we met at Earl's party yesterday. Aha, right, excuse me. - I remember clearly now. - Excellent. Come in, please. - There. - Thank you. - Have a seat. - Just a moment. Just a second. - Here. - You shouldn't have. Just take them, they're not for you anyway. No? And for whom then? It's a little present for Countess Blanka. You were saying something about the last will. First I have to find someone to leave my belongings to. And who should that be? - The Countess. - I see. - Is it clear to you? - Not at all. Let's speak like men. I'm coming to ask you for the hand of the Countess. I've fallen for her last night. I'm not bothered by her strange costume. Her beauty is striking. And her noble origin is the last thing I'm missing among all my riches. - Do you get it now? - Fully. Do you agree? Excuse me, this is so sudden. Countess Blanka, my dear friend. Say that you are pleasantly surprised by my presence. And that will be enough to repay me for all the troubles I experienced. I'm confused. - Your arrival is unusual. - By the balcony? What a fitting way to visit a lady. How romantic. Do you remember that hot evening? - Where? - At the ball. That's where I saw you for the last time. The next day I was looking for you in vain. Where? - All over Hellianda. - Aha, all over Hellianda. Now I get it. Yes, our native Hellianda. - Courteous as always. - And faithful as well. You have a lute, play me my favorite song. - Which one is that? - You don't know? I do. Is it this one? No. You forgot so quickly. I was singing it the other time. - Where? - In our native Hellianda. During hot evenings. And this one? You know nothing. But I know what to think about you. I'll return my song back into your head. Give it! I'II let her know. But you have to give her time to think it over. Certainly, any large business deal has to be thought through. The one who knows love, is like a dove, this song's about. Love is a starry night, in the voice of a lute. Luring us by its sweet voice. I want to dream on silk. Day and night to follow my dreams. The scent of roses dizziness causes. I know that love hurts. As roses are afraid of a hot day. Love is a precious stone, love melts diamonds, the beauty of a rose, is dying in my hot embrace of love. And she shall be yours. - Doctor Karas. - This is my old friend from Hellianda. From Hellianda? Knight from Argnan. We've been friends with the Countess since childhood. - Pleased to meet you. - Would you like a seat? - Thank you. - Make yourself at home. Don't I know you from yesterday evening? I can't remember. And you are from Hellianda? - Of course. - And what about the shoes? - Excuse me? - What about the shoes?! I couldn't get the shoes. What doesn't one do for love and a poet for inspiration. Farewell, Countess. Good bye, Notary. Excuse me. Help! Musketeer, you forgot something! Careful, it's not mine. - A monster! - In your head, right? - I saw it! - Damn! The devil! I see the devil! You wouldn't do that. You don't want me to dress up like a musketeer? I do not ask of you that much. These angelic flowers will suffice, are they for me? - These are... - From you? How kind. And now let's kiss and make up. I'd wrinkle your collar. I swear I wasn't drunk last night. Believe me. I swear I wasn't drunk last night. Believe me. I'd own up if it was the truth. I'd say that it was over the joy from your arrival. - You would believe me. - Sure. - You see. But I really thought that it was the vampire. Countess Blanka looks very much like the Girl in Blue. Incredible resemblance. I know the picture in detail. You mean that your favorite cursed painting? Yes, sir. You can look for yourself if you do not believe me. It's in Karas' notarial custody. - In Countess' home? - Yes. That's not a bad idea. We could compare the two. Forgive me that I cannot treat you to anything special, - I didn't expect your visit. - This is no visit, Mr. Karas. We were just passing by and I wished to look at the Girl in Blue, which is in your safekeeping. The Castellan says that she looks much like your niece, Countess Blanka. That would be quite a comparison. Is the Countess home? - Just a small gift for her. - Thank you. Otylia, be so kind. Countess is upstairs. I'll call her. And I'll show you the way... To the painting of the Girl in Blue, if you'd be so kind. - I'll have look at it. Is it upstairs? - Yes. Actually no. - And where is it? - I don't know. You must know where you had put it? - Into the study. - And did you move it again? - No. - Then it has to be there. Earl, I beg you, don't want to see it. You have to allow me to look at my painting. I'm warning you. Don't you know that the painting is cursed? Those are mere fairytales. I warned you. That's it. All will be revealed. My precious. I won't leave you again. A beautiful painting. And the resemblance is striking. Is it possible? Notary, you didn't announce me to the Countess. Could you ask her to come here for a while? - I'd like to see her next to the picture. - Yes, I'll call her. Blanka, where are you? Say something! Blanka! - Otylia! - What is it? - Didn't you see Countess Blanka? - She's in the bedroom. - She's not there. Did she go out? I'd see her. Look upstairs again. - She couldn't have disappeared. - She probably did. Forgive me, Earl, I'm not myself today. I forgot to tell you that Countess Blanka left today. So suddenly? And where to? To Hellianda. Some pressing matter. I'm sorry to hear that. Really. I'd so much like to see her again. Excuse us for disturbing. - The painting surly takes much space. - No! Not at all. Thank you for your kindness, I'll take it to the castle. - Castellan will organize it. - Yes, sir. She will at least remind me of your beautiful relative. As you wish, Earl. Good bye. Blanka, why did you go back into the painting? How could you have done this to me? You knew how much I loved you. And you do not anymore? But of course I do. And I always will. But I prefer you alive. You taught me to love a woman with all her caprice and moods. Which one has to pay attention to. I loved your laughter and your tears changing like April weather. It's quite nice to have a real woman. One never knows what's coming next. And now it's over. You changed a lot, Jan. Congratulations. But I was lucky too. I fell in love with you, Jan. What is it? - I'm hallucinating. - Stop acting surprised. You know very well. I wanted to play a game with you, but I lost. No joking about it. Well, now I'm in love and there's no hope for me. Blanka, darling, I thing I'm going crazy! It's worth it. I love you with all my heart. Although I know it's futile. I love you, because you lack the faults of other men. You don't fight or get upset over nothing. You're not selfish or conceited. You always wear a smile. And if I really do something, you can't be angry for long. You see, I'm being sensible, you're an ideal lover for life. Pity it's all over. But it's all of my doing. That's why I won't see you ever again. Good bye, Jan. And forgive me. Blanka! - What is it? - I'm not Blanka. - I'm Wanda. - You're not from the painting? - No, I'm from Prague. - You're not a Countess? - I'm a philosopher. - And what about the historic stuff? It's my hobby. I like it. I hope you can explain what was all that comedy about. You should have been watching any move in your master's house. And not to bring my niece here without your knowledge. - Into the office? - No, into the painting. - Even worse! - And don't damage anything! You, gentlemen, convinced me alone! You should have talked us out of it! Such a decent person. - Suddenly! - I'm surprised! But she's so pretty. Wait, don't take the painting away. Where's the Countess? You're late, madam. The Countess is not here. But I have to compare them! Let me in. Something's not right! Gentlemen, what are you talking about? Mrs. Otylia, Blanka and my niece Wanda, is the same person! And this very person loves your master. - That's all right then. - It is not! Doctor Karas should have his say and I think... - I think you have to go out, lady. - Horrible manners! - Gentlemen! - Dear friend, we are... - I know everything. What a fool I was! - Right, you were. - But no more. Come with me. Quick! - Where to? - To the witnesses. - Witnesses? Against whom? I see. God, I'm so glad that I'm the first one to congratulate you. I'm overjoyed. - Good luck, Countess. - Thank you, madam. I'd be glad if you could call me simply Mrs. Karas. Madam, no need being sad. Really? The End
