[The Star of Solitude...] [is one of the two Menaces told in legends.] [Those destined to suffer a fate of loneliness...] [will not suffer directly from the fate,] [but can instead spread the curse to those around them.] [People will avoid being in contact on sight.] [On rare occasion, help might prove to be a blessing,] [yet that doesn't stop one from being cursed with disaster and agony.] [The help received causes immense guilt for others have suffered instead.] [Cursed by the Star of Solitude, life will be a journey of perils and woes.] Welcome, gentlemen. I am grateful for your visit. [Magnanimity and Great Capacity] I am grateful for your visit. You are here too? Who let you in? I should have his head for this. Grandma Chang, please. I am here to send Miss Yu Ruo my blessing. I made a purse for her as a gift. Huh. Bah! You are nothing but a jinx. All those in your life will get nothing but bad luck! We don't want your gift! Get out of here! But I... Just go! Go now! Leave! Leave! It's not me! It's not me! It's not me! It's not me! Miss Yu Ruo! [Detective Dee Solitary Skies Killer] Yao Huan. Ever since the battle at the Martyrs' Shrine, you've been in coma for over a hundred days. I promised you, I will search the whole world if I must... to have you cured. I am right here waiting for you... so we could admire the scenery and travel across the land together. Back then, the yard was full of guests. A fragile girl like herself... managed to kill four people... without alerting anyone at the scene? The servant was the closest to the entrance. She was killed as soon as she entered. Lord Chang and his wife died in front of the table. They might have died at the same time. Young Master Chang died on his own bed. He was the last to die. You are a jinx! Leave this place! [Chang's Residence] Don't ever come here again! [Chang's Residence] [Chang's Residence] Who let you in anyway? [Chang's Residence] Who let you in anyway? Stop! What is the fuss about? Sir. This is the woman, the whole family is dead because of her! Please arrest her at once. Execute her. You said the family was killed because of her. What evidence do you have? Sir! She brings nothing but bad luck. Whoever comes close, as long as she is there, nothing ever ends well! My young madam took pity on her, and now she is killed. The whole Chang family is dead because of her! [Chang's Residence] Stop crying! [Chang's Residence] [Chang's Residence] Get out of here! Don't ever come here again! You are beating an unarmed girl, do you have no respect for the law? Sir, I plea guilty. It was me who killed Lord Chang and his family. It's not Du Yu Ruo's doing. Please arrest me. Nonsense! This is as far as you should. I am a jinx. No one wants to be near my home. I am in charge of... investigating the murder. Since you admit you were the murderer, I must get to the bottom of it. As for the bad luck, I... never believe in superstitious tales. Even if they are real, I have a clear conscience, I have nothing to fear. Master Dee. Thank you. This is Hei. Inky? This is your snake? It could be a good companion for Bai. This is the only friend I have. I never got to know who my parents were. And then, I wandered to this place. My foster parents took me in. But a blight landed here, it took both of them from me. Who is Jiang He Sheng? [In Memory of Jiang He Sheng] Who is Jiang He Sheng? Who is Jiang He Sheng? He was a doctor. I met him on the market two years ago. Then, despite objection from his family, he insisted on marrying me. But in the end, when he was gathering herbs at the mountainside, he fell off a cliff. Sir. Now you know I was telling the truth. I bring nothing but disaster. Miss Yu Ruo was killed because of me. On the wedding, every guest saw it happen. Du Yu Ruo killed herself with a blade. But Miss Yu Ruo had a heart of gold. She loved Master Chang deeply. Why would she kill her lover? It was my fault. Because she took pity on me... and took care of me, that's why... she died such a tragic death. Master Dee. Take me to the Court of Judicature. I am willing to be held responsible. I don't want Miss Yu Ruo... to be branded as killer even after her death. Please, stand up. If you really do care about Yu Ruo, stop thinking of yourself as a jinx. Truth will prevail. If she really was innocent, I will give her justice. Her name will be cleared. Thank you. The wound matches the blade. There are no other sign of fighting on the deceased. There is no sign of poisoning either. Bai. Did you find anything? It's rhododendron molle. What is that? Rhododendron molle. It's mainly used to treat rheumatic diseases. But when extracting the essence and drink along with wine, it will cause one to lose their senses. So it was a neuroleptic. Indeed. This should explain why... Du Yu Ruo was able to kill four people. She drugged them before committing the crime. Are you sure... Du Yu Ruo was the murderer? The four of them... died by the same blade. Du Yu Ruo killed herself with that very blade. And the fatal wound... was not stabbed in one strike. The wound was caused by multiple stabbings. So... it could mean the killer wasn't strong enough to kill. Wasn't strong enough? Other than these five people at the scene, there was no sign of another person. Which means... the most suspicious of all... was none other than Du Yu Ruo who was likely the murderer. Yes. But, why? She and Master Chang was in love with each other. The Du and Chang families are not in a hostile relationship. It was the wedding she longed for. According to Luo Zi Sang, the last words uttered by Du Yu Ruo before she died... was "It's not me." What does that mean? How should I know? I am merely a coroner. I inspect the corpses. As for investigation, that is your job. Before I forgot... I've prepared a medication with the Sage's Herb... you brought back from the North. Let Miss Xie try it out. It could prove to be effective. The weather has turned cold. I changed your blanket with a thicker one. But I am not sure... if it was cosy enough for you. This is... the new formula Bai prepared. He told me this would make you better. If you don't wake up after this, I'll tear down his workshop. Arh! The mortal wound is at the throat. It was cut in one strike. There are over a dozens of stabbings on the body. All of them are deep wounds. Master Dee. Was it my doing? Did I kill Wu Da Qing? It must be me. It must be my doing. How is this happening? You are in shock, my lady. Come. This will calm the nerve. Take it. The marks on the bamboos are caused by silk threads, similar to those found on Master Chang's window. Could it be... the two murders were done by the same person? I doubt Miss Luo was the killer. Who could it be? You mean... [Silence And Order] You mean... [Silence And Order] you killed Wu Da Qing in your dream? [Silence And Order] [Silence And Order] I am not sure if it was a dream. I have no idea at all! Master Dee. You should just lock me up. I don't want anyone else... to die because of me. Miss Luo. Whether these deaths... were connected to your or not, we don't know for sure. It must be me. You have no idea how it felt... when it happened, it was so vivid and real. Miss Luo, what's wrong? Bai? She suffers from palpitation. So? She is chronically ill. Perhaps she was born to this illness. It must have been rough... for her to live this long. It was my fault. I gave her a pill to see ... if she knows any martial art. But I never thought... it would give her an attack. So it seems like... it was impossible for her to kill Wu Da Qing. Wu Da Qing wasn't drugged. He was killed while awake. He was the guard of Chang family. He was a strong man. Even if Luo Zi Sang wasn't ill, she was no match for him. All of the wounds are deep. With Luo Zi Sang's illness, it's almost impossible. Who are you? What do you want? Sir! Sir. Someone is trespassing the court. Keep watch on her, I'll have a look. You are awake. Stop it! Scoundrel! How dare you touch my whip! Father. You are no match for him. He is sparing you the embarrassment. I am Huo Bu Er. May I know who you are? So, you are the greatest swordsman, Chief Huo. It's my honour. I am supervisor of the Court, Dee Ren Jie. So you are Master Dee. What's the big deal? Hand over the killer who murdered Uncle Chang and his family! Qing. Master Dee. Chang Yuan Shan was my sworn-brother. I heard about the tragedy. I came here today... to ask a favour of you. I hope you could hand over the murderer. I must avenge my brother... with her blood. The investigation is till ongoing. We don't know the truth yet. Don't lie to us! Grandma Chang told me everything. That jinx of a woman... kill my uncle and his family. I want you to hand her over now. As I just told you, we don't know the truth yet. Not to mention punishment for the murderer... is to be decided by the Court of Judicature. It seems like Master Dee... refuse to accept my request. Fine. I'll see just how long... you can keep that jinx safe. Let's go. Dee Ren Jie the detective... never let the evil go unpunished. Neither would he wrong any innocent. He will be able to... answer your doubt for you. Don't worry. Father. We are leaving just like that? It's just the Court of Judicature. Are you afraid of him? This is the city of the Emperor. This is not the Huo's Manor. Qing. Pay the Chang family a visit. Find out what happened... the day Uncle Chang died. Remember, pay attention to every detail. Do as I said. Yes. Master Dee. Are you not afraid at all? Why should I? As long as your conscience is clear, don't be bothered by the rumours. Zi Sang. Master. Master. Judging by Master Ye's age, you are about the same age as Miss Luo. What? Do you need to be old to be a master? That is not what I meant. May I ask, Master Ye, how did you meet Miss Luo? None of your concerns. I don't care why you approach Zi Sang, but leave while you still can. Are you saying... Miss Luo will bring disaster to me? Any who comes close to her... will end up dead or suffering, right? Superstition won't work on me. You don't believe it? Do you? Then why are you staying with her? Ten years ago, I found Zi Sang starving on the mountainside. Back then, I read her fortune. Of course she is not the bringer of disaster. But she carries the fate of Star of Solitude. It's her fate to be without friends or family. All those close to her... will eventually be gone. Aren't you afraid? I carry the Fate of Plough with me, her fate and mine cancel each other out. That should be enough to keep dangers at bay. So I took her in as my apprentice. That sounds too good to be a coincidence. The life of a person... has been destined all along. It doesn't matter if you don't believe it. It's not like I care about your life. I just don't want Zi Sang to be sad again. Zi Sang is naive. When someone shows her kindness, she will never forget it. Every time someone leaves her, she was left with pain. Master. Master Dee. What noodles do you prefer? Master Dee... has other work to tend to. Yes, Master Dee? It seems like... I won't get to try your cooking today. Goodbye. [Nimbus Inn] My lady. Have a break. Yes. Father. I got answers. How is it? I unblocked her meridian points with silver needles. And with your Sages' Herb, I believe she will soon be awake. You've been staring at it the whole night. Did you even find anything? I am still not sure... what this thing really is. However, I am certain that... marks from both of the crime scenes... must be related to this. I have an idea. We'll ask around the Ghost Market tomorrow. We might be able to find a lead. Ghost Market? When we fought, you didn't show me mercy. He didn't mean ill, he simply cares too much about someone. So you knew who that was? Qing. They witnessed... Du Yu Ruo go berserk and kill the others? They didn't see that. But who else could it be? Not to mention... if she was innocent, why would she take her own life? Right, Father. I was also told... that Du Yu Ruo had always been gentle. She must have killed the other... because of that jinx! Where did Master go? Why isn't he back yet? Hei. So, why would there... be someone as righteous as Dee Ren Jie? He is not afraid of me. He meant it when he told me. He even said... I shouldn't be bothered by the rumours. He even defended me in front of the others. [This is the Ghost Market?] [There is not a living soul here.] [The Ghost Market...] [is a place outside the city of Chang An...] [where illicit dealings are made...] [and the outlaws...] [exchange information.] Because it's an underbelly, it won't be so easily found. He is with me. Pay me back later. Try not to speak later. If they found out you are from the Court, you are on your own. You sounded like you are not working with me. Are you here for the weapons? That is the Strang Armoury of Shandong. They can forge hidden weapons... beyond your wildest imagination. There is quite the crowd here. There are more to know about Chang An that you don't know. They are the Desert Nemesis. As long as you pay well, they can kill anyone for you. Let's go. Fortune-telling. What is he selling? Stinky tofu? Who is this brat over here? How dare you say my exquisite cuisine... is stinky! Let him have a taste of this. Exquisite? Herb Master. Herb Master? Herb Master, you've been staring at it all day, do you know what it is or not? Hah. What if I know? What if I don't know? Life is at stake here. Please enlighten us. It's not my life, why should I even care? Sir. You are a healer yourself. Healer has a virtuous heart. Hold on. I may be a doctor, but I never heal the living. I only study... how to make dying happy and enjoyable. Thirty years ago, your enemies were hunting you, we gave your shelter. It's time for you... to return the favour. Who are you? That is none of your concerns. If you help us today, the Cang clan will consider... your debt paid. This thing... is called the Mount Yin Silk. it can only be weaved from the silk of frost silkworm. And the frost silkworm... is indigenous to Mount Yin. It can't be found in Chang An. Is there a way... to track down whoever made this? Have a look at this thread instead. Within this silk thread, there is a cross. It's hard to weave this thread. Of the whole Chang An, only Nine-finger Elder has the skill. The cross is his own personal trademark. Where does he live? He lives in the Ghost Market. Enough. I've said enough. Find him yourself. The Nine-finger Elder... only has nine fingers, yet he put a cross that means "ten". Humans do that. The more we lack something, the more we care about. Nine-finger Elder. Hey! Is this your work? He... He killed someone. Hey! Hey! Stop right there! It seems like... the Nine-finger Elder used the silk from this... to weave the thread. But why did he say... the silkworm killed? He meant... Someone used the silk from frost silkworm... to commit murder. But sadly... he did get to tell us who that is. Right. Where is the killer? Could it be the same person... to sneaked into the Court? I didn't get to fight the person, but... judging by the figure, they are not the same person. And strangely, I chased him all the way to the Court, then he vanished. So whoever that was... knows the city's layout very well. If my guess is right, the man who sneaked in that night... could likely be Ye Leng. He just wanted to know if he could trust me, he doesn't want me to hurt Zi Sang. But... the person we met just now... We just arrived in the Ghost Market, and that person killed the Nine-finger Elder. This couldn't be mere coincidence. Well, we need to find out... what kind of person... Ye Leng really is. Who is there? Master Dee. Miss Luo. I was passing the Yongning Street. I was just dropping by. I appreciate this, Master Dee. I am fine. That should put your heart at ease. Miss Luo. Is there some misunderstanding between us? I've been living here by myself. If you come here too frequently, people could misunderstand. Unless it's important, you should avoid coming here. Miss Luo. Don't take this wrongly. I am here... to have a word with Master Ye. Please wait here for a moment. I'll prepare some tea. Very well. Master Dee. This is a peculiar tree. Mulberry tree, I've never seen this before. My master planted this tree. It used to grow on Mount Yin. It shouldn't have survived the climate of Chang An. But I managed to keep it from dying. Because of this, my master even gave me compliment. I am sorry, Miss Luo. Something came into my mind just now. I must leave now. The man in black suit came looking for a dead body. But why? Bai Hui acupoint, Dan Zhong acupoint, and Ming Men acupoint. There was some bleeding. Bai. I found it. I found it as well. We know where the silk came from. We know the mysteries to Du Yu Ruo's body. But... how are they related? And don't forget, the person who trespassed that night, the person who killed Nine-finger Elder, and the one who was trying to steal Du Yu Ruo's body, were those three different people, or were there only two people? Or perhaps one person only? Well, we don't can't be sure about the first two, we could start... with this lead. You have a plan in mind? Concerns make one distracted. The only one who can make that person distracted... is none other than her. Miss Luo. Miss Luo. You and Master Dee... are a match made in heaven, a couple destined to be together! Please open the door. We can discuss about this. Miss Luo. You are already of age for marriage. Master Dee is being true to his feelings for you. Should you have any request, feel free to let us know. They are trying to kill me! Dee Ren Jie. What are you up to now? Miss Luo. I really do wish to marry you. I know. You don't want me to be harmed. But as I said, I am not afraid. Even if you are the bringer of disaster, I, Dee Ren Jie, am strong enough... to overcome it. Perhaps... we were meant to be married to each other. Silence! I don't care if you are her master. You can't stop me. Luo Zi Sang. I will marry you. You are asking for this! Master. Master. Miss Luo. I mean what I said just now. Star of Solitude? Bringer of disaster? I don't care. Silence! Master Dee, you should leave. Miss Luo. I will never agree to this. I will never give up. I will be back again. It wasn't Ye Leng? Yao Huan? Yao Huan, it's me! Yao Huan. Yao Huan! Same symptoms as Du Yu Ruo? Yes. But her pulses are stable. She has recovered from her past injury. But as for why she is still in a coma, I don't know either. What kind of sorcery is this? What have you done to Yao Huan? I thought you would ask... why I killed the Chang family. So you only care about your lover. Tell me. Now that I am in your hand, I don't plan to get out of here alive. But this is well worth it. I have Xie Yao Huan on my journey to death. You... What must I do... so you would save Yao Huan? Let me leave. After I brought Zi Sang to safety, Xie Yao Huan... will be safe. All those bloodsheds... were because Luo Zi Sang? Do not use her like a bargaining chip. I am not you. I could say the same! I won't resort to using lowly plot. What have you done... to take control of Du Yu Ruo? What made her kill her family? She was controlled just like Yao Huan. If you let me leave, whatever you wish to know, I shall gladly tell you. Not a chance. Then you should be prepared... for Xie Yao Huan's funeral. I assure you, I will find the answers. Master Dee. Miss Luo. I just visited Miss Xie. I am sorry. I don't know why master would try to hurt her. This is not your fault. Do not blame yourself. So Miss Xie... Master Meng told me... you two were... I am in love with her. Miss Luo. I did what I did... to provoke Ye Leng. If my action offended you, I am willing to apologize. Not at all, Master Dee. I... I don't mind at all. Besides, no one would love a jinx like me. Miss Luo. I am fine. I mean it. I wish to see my master. [Miss Luo.] [There is something...] [that you should know.] [It's about Du Yu Ruo's death.] What now? [Has Master Dee changed his mind?] Master. Why are you here? Master. Was it you... who got Miss Yu Ruo killed? Was it you... who made her kill her whole family? Dee Ren Jie told you everything? I can't believe it. I can never believe this. I want to hear it from you. Was it true? Why? Why did you kill her? Because she wanted you to get married. She was even helped you find a husband. It's been ten years. Zi Sang. Why don't you understand? You and I are meant for each other. Only I can be with you. Other than me, you don't need anyone else. Whoever it is, if they want to take you away from me, they must all die. Master. Stop calling me that! I don't want to be your master. If my guess is right, Du Yu Ruo, the Chang family, and Wu Da Qing, and even Jiang He Sheng who died two years ago, they all died by your hands. Correct? He should have known better. Just like you. Zi Sang. You are the bringer of disaster. Why didn't they fear you? What are you talking about? It was me who told everyone... that you carry the curse. It was me who made your life lonely... and away from people. I just want a peaceful life with you by my side. They shouldn't have bothered us! Insanity! You are insane! What about Miss Xie? Why did you hurt her? All because of him. He was clearly madly in love with Miss Xie. Yet he still tried to approach you. I was eavesdropping by the window. You were going to the Ghost Market. I returned to the room, only to find your lover... was already awake. So I use that chance to take control of her. I made her kill the Nine-finger Elder for me. The killer you saw that day, that was Yao Huan. Surprised? You've been waiting for her to wake up. Yet she is not my puppet. Master. I beg of you. Let Miss Xie go. You've done enough. Zi Sang. I am doing all of this for you. Master. If any harm comes to Miss Xie, I will never forgive you for the rest of my life! You are really in love with him. For him, you would even save the woman he loves? Master! Leave me be! I will never tell you anything. Fine. Since they all died because of me, then I shall make amend by taking my own life. Miss Luo! Zi Sang. Master! I'll ask you one last time. Will you please let Miss Xie go? It's Silk Acupuncture. An art passed down in my family. With three silk threads... each inside the acupoints of Bai Hui, Dan Zhong and Ming Men, I can block the victims' acupoints. It will make them lose their senses... and I controlled them like puppets with silk threads. Such a vile technique. How do we undo it? It cannot be undone. It can't be undone? Explain yourself! I can't undo it. I only learn how to use it, and before I could learn how to undo it, my father passed on. If I died, Xie Yao Huan... will never open her eyes again. [I must go to the Herb Master.] [He might have a cure.] [Stay here.] [Take care of Yao Huan.] [Stay cautious.] Silk Acupuncture? I did hear about it. It's a technique used by Mount Qi Sect. Should the silk thread blocked your acupoints, your mind is awake, but you would lose control of your body. Just like when the bride killed that family. She was awake the whole time. But she couldn't control her actions. That was dreadful. Such a tragedy! My exquisite soup is the best to have in this world. It's the best way for one to die. Is there a way to undo it? Sure, of course. What is it? I do not know. I told you, didn't I? It's a technique from Mount Qi Sect. Why would they teach an outsider like me? But I assure you, I can give you a bowl of my exquisite soup for free. Let your dear lover have this, let her die a happy end. Take it or leave it. This conversation is over. Where is the Mount Qi Sect? Mount Qingyao. Are you going to them? You should just give up on the thought. The Mount Qi Sect... is mysterious and a bunch of oddities. You can try, but you might not find them. Even if you found them, they might not want to help. Don't waste your life away! I am not done yet! Fortune telling? Gosh. All because of love. What is love? Life is risked for the sake of it. Why are you here? Master Dee. I wish to aid you in saving Miss Xie. Miss Luo. I know I may not be of much help. But it all started because of me. I must do something. Promise me, do as I say. What's the matter? I am fine. Come. Have some rest. Miss Luo. Does it remind you of something? For some reason, I've never been to this place, yet I could feel the sorrow in my heart. At least a hundred lives were lost here. It will be disturbing to anyone. If... these are the people from Mount Qi Sect, does it mean... Judging by the look, they've been dead for over a decade. We came here for nothing. Look there. I think I saw something. Miss Luo, there is a cave. Let's go. Miss Luo. If you are afraid, wait here. I'll go with you. Very well. Get down! Let's go. What is this? It's over here too. So, this is where... Mount Qi Sect archived their martial arts. This must be about the Silk Acupuncture. If there is a record about it, there should be a way to undo it. Miss Luo. What's wrong? I am fine. What are these? If my guess is right, These are the steps to undo the Silk Acupuncture. But to keep them a secret, they are encrypted with codes of Mount Qi Sect. What do we do now? The Mount Qi Sect has perished. Let's keep looking. June 9th, Third Year of Tian Shou Era. Enemies came into our land, they killed every last one of our people. Before Chief Xuan Qing Zi was executed, she cast a curse. [The Mount Qi Sect...] [shall have revenge for this...] [even if there is but one man left!] [The Mount Qi Sect shall have revenge for this...] [even if there is but one man left.] I was fortunate enough... to have escaped the massacre. I must avenge my people... or I shall never rest in peace. By your son, Chen. Miss Luo. Are you not feeling well? I don't know either. I... Miss Luo. Listen. Let me get you out of this cave. Come. Let's go. [If my guess is right,] [Ye Leng is the only survivor of Mount Qi Sect.] [Maybe he could decipher the codes.] [We must hurry back to the Capital.] Go to Bai at once. I'll cover you. Run! Run! Who are you? Who sent you? Why do you want me dead? Talk! Halt! Miss Luo. Miss Luo. Miss Luo? Miss Luo. What happened? Go to the woods in the west. Save Dee Ren Jie. Dee Ren Jie. Master Dee? What's wrong with her? She had an episode of palpitation. But she is fine now. I am fine. I am glad you are. Where are you going? Get Ye Leng and save Yao Huan. Ye Leng. I am sorry to disappoint you. I found a way to undo your technique. Open the door. Yes. Who was it? Why would they kill Ye Leng? Who could it be? Who did this? Dee Ren Jie. Calm down. I finally managed to cure Yao Huan of her injury. But Ye Leng cast her into coma again. I finally found a way to undo the acupuncture. But with Ye Leng dead, the last survivor of Mount Qi Sect is dead! With Ye Leng gone, Yao Huan... might never open her eyes again. How am I supposed to calm down? I can't close this case. I must find Ye Leng's murderer. I don't care who they are, I don't care why they did it, I must find them! [Master.] [Even after everything you had done,] [you are my benefactor nonetheless.] [I shall see you off from this world.] [I hope you could let go of your obsessions...] [Here Lies My Master Ye Leng] [I hope you could let go of your obsessions...] [Here Lies My Master Ye Leng] [be reborn into a better life.] [Here Lies My Master Ye Leng] [Here Lies My Master Ye Leng] This flute... was by your side all the time. But you had never played it. Today, it will keep you company for me. Ye Leng was killed with his whole meridian system crushed. The murderer has powerful inner strength. We might not be a match for them. Who would want Ye Leng dead so badly? Could it be the same people who ambushed you? It could be possible. Judging by the writings I found... on Mount Qi that were written in blood, Ye Leng could very likely be... Chen the last survivor of Mount Qi Sect. The people who wiped out the whole Mount Qi Sect... without alerting the others... are a force to be reckoned with. You are suspecting whoever killed Ye Leng... were the same people who wiped out the Sect? But why would they want to kill me? Do you remember that night... when I ran into the intruder? We fought for a while. That person was a mighty warrior. If that was the same person who killed Ye Leng, I think the dots are connecting. You are right. The killer conducted a raid that wiped out Mount Qi Sect. And years later, someone was found using Silk Acupuncture. Which is why... the killer sneaked in... to check on Du Yu Ruo's body. After we arrested Ye Leng, the killer confirmed he was the last survivor of Mount Qi Sect. So they killed Ye Leng. As for me, maybe it's because I found the Mount Qi Sect... and uncovered the massacre that happened ten years ago. So... they don't just want me dead... They will kill Zi Sang! Miss Luo! Miss Luo! Search the outside. Hei? Third of August, I await your arrival at the Nimbus Inn. Chief Huo. You rarely come to Chang An. Why the hurry to leave? He is right. I came here... to investigate... [Magnanimity and Great Capacity] to investigate... [Magnanimity and Great Capacity] the death of my brother Chang Yuan Shan. [Magnanimity and Great Capacity] [Magnanimity and Great Capacity] Now, the Court of Judicature is undermining my work. So today, I shall bid everyone here farewell. Come. Cheers! Today, I am glad to have... everyone here. Allow my daughter to showcase her swordplay... and lift the spirit for everyone. Qing, are you out of your mind? Could it be... Silk Acupuncture! Everyone, stop. Don't hurt my daughter. Do you think only you have children? When you killed others' children, did you not feel... the pain of their parents? Who is it? Enough of your tricks. Come out! Miss Luo. Huo Bu Er. In order to be the greatest family of the martial art world, you signed a treaty with Mount Qi Clan. My people... used our Silk Acupuncture... to eliminate countless enemies for you in secrecy. Do you even remember that? Afterwards, in order to bury the scandal for good, your brought your whole army... and wiped out the whole Mount Qi Sect! Today, it's time for you... to pay for your sin! Lies! Who sent you here to slander me? Speak! You are leaving me with no choice. This... is the treaty you signed with my mother years ago. Do you think wiping out the Sect... was enough to cover up your sin? Truth will always prevail! So you are the daughter... of that cursed Xuan Qing Zi. I thought Ye Leng was her child. You killed Ye Leng? It was you who ambushed us. It's too late... for you to realize it. Guards. My brethren, heed my command. Leave no one alive! He wants to kill us all. Huo Bu Er! Are you trying to kill us as well? What is the meaning of this? Now that you know the secret, I can't allow you to live. Kill them! Kill him! Let my daughter go! Come at if you want! Fine. I will give you a chance. If you take your own life, I'll let her go. Not a chance! Daughter! Miss Luo. I am fine. Let my daughter go. Didn't my mother tell you? Once the silk entered her body, only those from the Sect can undo the binding. Do you really think... cutting off the thread was enough to save her? Let my daughter go. Do it or you will pay dearly for this! If you want her to wake up, feel free to kill me. Miss Luo. Everything that happened was my doing. Leave my daughter out of this. Kill me if you must. Let her go. Do you think your life... is worth all the lost souls of Mount Qi Sect? Miss Luo. It was his sin to begin with, it has nothing to do with Miss Huo. I beg of you. Dee Ren Jie. You must be our witness. I shall pay the price of my sin with this life. After I died, you must save my daughter. Huo Bu Er! You once told me... you would bring all the evils... to justice of the law. Today, I am leaving the massacre of Mount Qi Sect... to your judgement. This is... the way to undo the Silk Acupuncture. Master Dee. May you and Miss Xie... be together until the end. Miss Luo! Miss Luo! Miss Luo! Miss Luo! Stay away from me! I regret it. If I could learn my past sooner, thing would be better. [Ye Leng's true identity...] [was my cousin.] [Huo Bu Er led a raid on Mount Qi Sect.] [My mother knew it wouldn't end well,] [so she passed all of her power...] [to the three years old girl I was.] [She ordered Ye Leng...] [to take me to the woods.] [That's how we got away.] [But my mother's power took a toll on my body.] [It almost got me killed.] [Ye Leng...] [used needle to seal away the power inside of me.] [With that, I lost the memories about my past.] I thought... when I grow up, we could avenge my mother together. But Ye Leng couldn't see me in pain. He chose to take revenge by himself. He's been waiting for an opening for years. But Huo Bu Er had been discrete. So he figured... killing Chang Yuan Shan... would lure Huo Bu Er to Chang An. But in the end... Ye Leng didn't want you to be part of this plan, so why burden yourself with it? So many people died because of me! How could I possibly live with the guilt? Miss Luo. You are a kind person. None of this... was ever your fault. Thank you, Master Dee. Miss Luo! Zi Sang! Zi Sang! Zi Sang! Why must do you this? Huo Bu Er. In order to secure your power, you ordered numerous assassinations, and in order to cover your crime, you massacred the over a hundred people of Mount Qi Sect. According to the law, you must be executed. Father! You can't kill my father! Father! Qing. My sins are unforgivable. I deserve the worst punishment. But as long as you are alive, even in death... I shall find peace. No! Father! No! Father! Father! [Miss Luo.] [Huo Bu Er has been brought to justice.] [The Mount Qi Sect is avenged.] [I hope...] [you can now find peace.] [I will take care of Hei.] [It will be a great companion for Bai.] [Don't you worry.] I am afraid... I'll never set foot into this place again.
