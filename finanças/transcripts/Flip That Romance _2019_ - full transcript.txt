Jules. Hey, Terry, I'm almost done with your arrangement. I'm just adding some tulips for effect. Perfect. Well, you know your bouquets are my good luck charm. Every open house. Well, I predict you'll have multiple offers by 5:00pm. I hope so. Mmmhmm. So are you ready for today? As I'll ever be. If I get this duplex it will be my biggest undertaking yet. Oh, it's in an up and coming neighbourhood. I sold a house there that went for way over asking. Maybe you can finally branch out on your own and flip houses full time. I heard that, Terry. And while I'll miss having her around here I am all for her being a full-time designer. See? Now that's a good boss. Well, it helps when she also raised you. Well, you've come a long way since that first flip you did- Oh, Alice, we don't talk about the first flip. Oh. Ok, well you've learned a lot since the flip we do not mention. And I'm proud of you. Thank you, mom. And don't worry, I'm still gonna help you at the Home and Garden show. It's too bad you can't buy both sides of the duplex because then I could sell two. I can't afford both sides, and only one is up for auction. The other one sold six weeks ago. Here you go. Speaking of, I need to get to the bank and then I'm meeting Kenny, my contractor. I've gotta get to my open house but call me when you're done! You got this! It's rough, Jules. Come on, what do I always say? An empty house is a story waiting to happen. But you see the potential, right? Well, it's my job. What's your renovation budget? Well, it's hard to know exactly without inspection. It's going up as is. No inspections allowed. So we won't know what we've got until we've got it? Wouldn't be the first time. You know who owns the other side? Nothing in the public record yet, and it was empty when I went to check it out. So we're flying blind here? Come on, Kenny. We love a good challenge. Yeah, yeah, of course. Ok, and what's your bid? $127,000 max. If I go over I'll be dipping into renovation funds. Or my personal savings. Now, don't overextend yourself, ok? There's always unforeseen expenses. Ok. I put in an extra shot of espresso. So what time is the auction? We're heading there right now. Ok, fingers crossed. Thanks, Kat. Thank you. Welcome. I have a feeling about this one. You said that the last four times. And I was right the last four times so we're all good. Hey, isn't that- No. No, no, no, he lives in Portland now. That must be his dad. They both have Waddell trucks. Well, good. 'Cause I don't need any more competition in this town. Alright, how's my game face? Ooh, you're ready. Let's do this. Okay, so $127,000. And remember, never go over your max. I know, I know. Like the last flip pay for your next flip. Yes, exactly. Yes. Oh, I'm-I'm so- Hi, Jules. Lance. I am gonna go sign you in. Lance. Kenny. I guess that wasn't his dad's truck, right? Yeah. Got that. What're you- what're you doing here? I thought you were in Portland doing the contractor thing. I was but then my dad asked me to come back and help him with the business here in Bedford. So you are. So I am. Still flipping houses I hear, with Kenny no less. And who'd you hear that from? Well you know, people talk. Small real estate community. Ok, my dad told me. Says you're getting pretty good at it, too. You say that like you're surprised. No, not surprised at all. You're organized, good follow through, completely... determined. Well, I guess I don't believe in the fly by the seat of my pants method of business, tends to be costly. Well, you never know what you're gonna get until you open up the walls. You gotta be willing to bend. I'm always willing to bend. Except when you're not. Oh, I bend. When a bendable situation arises. But you can't always act on impulse, it's irresponsible. There's a difference between impulse and instinct. Veering from the plan is always a recipe for disaster. Well, I guess that's where you and I disagree. Oh, that's where? As opposed to everywhere else? Ok, you got me on that. I guess we probably didn't make the best... team. You look good, Jules. Hey, Jules? Your lot's coming up next. My lot's coming up next. So I hear. Good luck. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, that wasn't awkward at all. Not in the slightest. Little bit awkward for me, but that's alright. What're you doing? Bidding on the Holland Avenue duplex. I'm bidding on the Holland Avenue duplex. Well, I guess that would explain both of our attendance here today. So it's on then. I guess it's on, yeah. Next property up for bid, lot 127. A two-bedroom, two bath 1800 square foot duplex, left side unit only, located at 1218 Holland Avenue. I'll start the bidding at $70,000. $70,000, thank you. Do I hear $75,000? $75,000 on the floor. Thank you. So, what's your max bid? Oh, come on, Lance, you don't ask a lady that number. Just wanna know what I'm dealing with here. Come on, how deep are those pockets? Deep enough. You just worry about your own pockets. How about $90,000 for this property here? 1800 square feet. Do I hear $90,000? $90,000 down in front. Thank you. Interesting technique. Driving the price up, kinda bidding against yourself that way, but- I've done this before, I know what I'm doing. Alright. Besides, you're not even bidding. Well, I like to sit back and wait. See who's been priced out, then I pounce. Well, you better hurry up because I'm about to wrap this thing up. We'll see about that. $95,000 for this property. Thank you again, sir. $95,000. $100,000. Do I hear $110,000? $110,000. You call that a pounce? $120,000. $125,000. Thank you. $127,000. And we have a high bid of $127,000. Going once, going twice... $132,000. $135,000. It seems we have a bidding war here. $140,000. That is way over your max. Just cut your losses. There are other properties. Too rich for my blood. $140,000 going once... going twice... $143,000. Going once, going twice... Well, I guess I'm the one who's out now. Sold for $143,000 to paddle number 11. Our next property up for bid, lot 128. Congratulations. Mmm. Two bedroom, one bathroom, 910 square-foot house. It's-it's ok. It'll be fine, we'll just have to economize. We don't even know what we're dealing with yet. So we'll economize and pray. So what was that back there? That was Lance being Lance. Jules, that was like two years ago. How is he still able to get under your skin? He's not. Oh, he is. Kenny, he's not. But he's always so sure of himself, acting like I don't know what I'm doing. Ok, alright, I stand corrected. I mean, it was the first time for both of us flipping that house, not just me. He had never done it without his dad. Well, you learned a lot. Mostly never to work together again. Because he blamed me when things went wrong even though he made a big decision without consulting me. Everything was different between us after that. Well, things didn't go wrong, you broke even. It happens. Breaking even is a loss when you consider time spent. I lost a lot more than money on that project. But I imagine he won't be here long. When things go wrong he leaves. Well, hopefully you won't have to run into each other again. Besides, we have way bigger issues to deal with, like that $16,000 deficit in your budget. Yeah. There is no need to worry, Jules. I'm a miracle worker, you know that. I'm counting on that. This is great, having you back in the shop again. Get used to it, pop. It's home now. Good because all of this is gonna be yours soon. I like this piece. Yeah, it's not bad. It helps me clear my head. I ran into an old friend today. Jules. Well, that was bound to happen eventually. I guess. How was it? Well, it's safe to say she's still upset with me for leaving. Well, maybe over time she'll be just as happy as I am to have you back here. I wouldn't count on that, pop. You know Lance, I've been thinking... all this stuff is just gathering dust. I told you when you sold the place, pop, that I'm keeping those. I made them for mom. I know that, son. It's been three years and all she ever really wanted for you was to share your abilities with the world. And I do. Waddell Contracting and Renovations. Speaking of which, if we're gonna get you to retire we better get back to the real work. Hey, morning. Morning. Oh, thanks. So, what do you think? Well, it's not terrible. Good bones, did a loop around the exterior, no sizeable cracks. Went underneath, foundation looks good. Wow, you're fast. Yeah, well, you're not my only client. Hmm. Yes, but I'm the only one you've known since you were nine so I'm your favourite one. Yeah, true. Very fair. Whew. You know, I really hope this is worth the price of admission. You read my mind. Come on. Let's go in and see what we're dealing with. Looks like the roof needs work. Stairs need to be replaced, the railings are loose and we're gonna have to patch that stucco before we paint. Ok. Moment of truth. Please let the truth be kind. It's not so bad. It's not so good, either. Yeah, but I've done a lot with much worse. We got this. Yeah. We've got this. We're definitely gonna need to replace the electrical wiring. The whole system needs an upgrade. I'll put it on the list, along with a nice hardwood in place of this, whatever this is. Hello! Hey Terry, we're in here! Oh wow, this is... charming. Yeah. A sea foam green. Just wanted to come check out what I'll be selling. Well, it's rough but we're getting there. Sounds like the neighbours got a head start on renovations. Yeah, they must have just gotten here. I should go talk to them about the exterior. If you can hear them. Well, we'll be paying them back soon enough with our demo. Yeah, which will be soon, so I'm gonna start working on my quote and I'll call you later to discuss. Perfect. Ok. Hey, be gentle! Oh, oh, oh, oh!!! That wasn't supposed to happen. Hi Terry. Hi Jules. Lance? What're you doing? Looks like I slipped. No. No, no, no. No, I mean what-what- what are you doing here on the other side of my wall? I'm demoing my wall. Wait, you own that side? Yeah. Made sense to try to buy both but uh, you win some, you lose some, right? No, no. Why-why didn't you say something at the auction? Look, I'm gonna get this thing fixed today. I take responsibility for my mistakes. Oh, oh, do you now? Yeah? Really? Because that really wasn't ever your thing. You know, now, walking away? That. That you're good at. Ok, I guess we're doing that now. Yeah, no, no, no. We're not-we're not doing that, we're um... we're gonna go get coffee. We're gonna... make some plans. Right. Ok. - Ok. Bye Lance. - Bye Terry. Nice to see you. Yeah. Always. Oh, I take mine with cream, no sugar. Cream. No sugar. Wow, thanks. The wall's all patched. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. So to what do I owe this gesture? Apology? Gesture. We need to talk about the exterior. Come on in. Thank you. I'm sure there's more things to discuss than just the exterior. No there's not. There's no need to rehash anything, it's all good. Are you sure? I tried calling you a few times. Oh, well you said it all back then, Lance. You made your choice and I learned to live with it. It's fine. You seem kind of behind considering your side sold way before mine. I'm knocking down a load-bearing wall so I had to get an architect to draw up some plans. Which wall? Oh I'll never tell. Oh. Still being secretive about knocking down walls I see. It was a closet. And it was not a secret. I came back to find the master closet gone. The master closet. There was still a linen closet. Closet space is precious. You knocked $10,000 off the selling price. That was an expensive decision without even consulting me. Well I'm glad we're not rehashing the past. No, we're definitely not. You're knocking down the wall between the dining room and the kitchen because that's the only one that makes sense. Unless, of course, you're still in the habit of knocking down walls that don't make sense. It made the bedroom bigger! With less closet space! Hold on. You're not knocking down the wall between the kitchen and the dining room too, are you? I'll never tell. I'm gonna find out eventually. Our open houses are probably going to occur around the same time. Not if I finish first. Well I plan on being done in... eight weeks. What a coincidence. So do I. Do I sense a little wager brewing? We go head to head. Eight weeks. May the best flip win. Who's the judge of the best? We go by final sale price. What's the winner get? More money. And the satisfaction of beating me if you can do it. Oh, I can, and I am in. Ooh. Well, may the best woman, or man, win. Bring it. It's been brought. Ok. Oh, thank you for the coffee by the way, that was very sweet. Hey. Sorry I'm late. I was finishing an arrangement for my mom and after this I'm meeting Kenny at the duplex. You are quite the multi hyphenate these days. Oh, triple-hyphenate. There's also the Home and Garden show, my mom's shop always has a booth. Oh, everyone has a booth. I have a booth. It's a great way to get your name out there. You should have a booth. Oh, I don't know, I have the duplex to worry about, and my mom's greenhouse. Oh come on, Jules, you are so good at this. People just need to know you're out there. Hey. Everyone is talking about the excitement the other day. Wait, what did you hear? The auction. You and your ex going toe to toe. Had a lot of tongues wagging around here. And yet no one could bother to tell me he was back. It hasn't been that long. Yes, and already he's making my life difficult, using my favourite tile guy so he's unavailable for me. Do you think Lance is doing that on purpose? Did this little wager just go next level to sabotage? No. I don't think. No, the tile guy's really that good. Is that Jules? What is he doing? Lance, I need this spot. That spot is mine. Oh, you are not getting this spot. Lance, you have to stop. You have to stop right now. Ooof! Oh, so typical of him. Just... Hey! Sorry, I couldn't see you. Yeah, I can't imagine why. It's alright, we just touched bumpers. Well, you should be careful. It's dangerous having your view so obstructed. It's just time management. I had to get it all in one trip. Well, it's called scheduling. Maybe you've heard of it? And there's the visual aids. Same old Jules. Don't need 'em. Are you sure about that? Wouldn't want anything to get missed. Sure you would. It'd give you an advantage, right? If I'm my usual careless self as you'd like to think of me- I never used the word "careless". I just recall many additional hardware store trips as you refused to make lists. I got it all up here. Ok, if you insist. Just trying to be a good neighbour. That's touching, thank you. I'm ok. However, if you need anything- I don't. Ok. - Great. - Great. Lance, are you in here? Richard! Whew. So, are you gonna have this place ready for me to put on the market for you in three months? Two, actually. I may have blurted out an eight-week turnaround to Jules. Oh. That seems totally manageable. What can I say? Always up for a little friendly competition. You certainly are. Friendly competition is fine but I have two other jobs right now. You couldn't have given me more time? I know, I'm sorry. It-look, if it's too much I don't- No, no, no. This is just as much a competition for me as it is for you. Waddell Contracting has made themselves a nice so I am gonna sell this side for way more money. We need to sell this side for way more money. We can't be the side that sells for less. And she's good. You know, I took a couple clients to her last property. Hey. I was trained by the great Ed Waddell, alright? I know exactly what to do with this place. You know exactly what to do with this place. This is it, Jules. This is the one that gets you where you're going and I am expecting a lot of work from you when your empire takes off. Wow. I'm gonna have an empire? Huh. Hi. Uh, this is Jules Briggs and I was wondering if it's not too late to sign up for a booth at the Home and Garden show? Oh, no, no, not- not for the nursery, this would actually be for me. For Jules Briggs Designs. Yes, I'll take it. Thank you. How did your mom take it, you leaving the shop? Well, I'm not leaving yet, I'm setting the stage so to speak. I have no idea how long I'm going to be faking it 'til I'm making it. Oh, not long at all. Don't worry about that. You're already making great headway. Is this it? Mmmhmm. I love it. You know what? None of this would even be happening if it weren't for Lance being back. Lance? What're you talking about? This has nothing to do with Lance. I know you two are like night and day but he challenges you. He always has. Well, I guess I felt that if he had to be right that meant that I was wrong and I don't like being told I'm wrong. Oh honey, don't I know it? These are for Eleanor Greene, she'll be here soon. I'll put them with the others. It wasn't only the flip. It seemed that we were always on opposite side of things, you know? Where to eat, what movies to see... Yeah, but that opens you up to a whole new world. Well, not in this case. It doesn't matter. He's got his side and I've got mine. I always thought Lance was good for you. Like a motivating force. Burning the midnight oil? Yeah, no rest for the weary, not when there's seven weeks to go. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I figure there's some demoing I could do at off hours. You were always good with a sledgehammer. Or maybe I was just getting all my aggression out. Yeah. So, the landscaping? Yeah, I was thinking something drought resistant, maybe drip irrigation. Wait, I-I'm-I'm sorry, are you joking? I would never joke about something as precious to you as plants. Drought resistant? We live in the Pacific Northwest. I'm well aware of where we live, Jules. It rains every 45 minutes. Why would you ever wanna go drought resistant? Why not try something different? Because it needs to make sense. See? Ok, that's so you, thinking big changes are the answers instead of looking around to see what you already have. Look, I have a lot at stake here. So do I. Yes, but your company is already established. My dad is, not me. I'm not trying to sully the Waddell name right before I take it over. You're taking over? In Bedford? Yeah, eventually. Dad wants to retire. That's why I have a lot to lose here, too, if I don't get this right. Ok, why don't we just put a pin in the landscaping conversation for now. Just give it some thought and regroup. Sounds good to me. Great. Now, if you'll excuse me I need to go destroy some kitchen cabinets. Always a favourite pastime after a conversation with me. Thanks for helping me carry these. Only six weeks left. I'm gonna be buying these guys a lot of coffee. No problem. I needed the walk this morning. And we have both been so busy I feel like I haven't seen you in a week. I know. But we're still having dinner tomorrow night. I'm making lasagne, my grandmother's recipe. Great. Kat and I are so looking forward to a girl's night. I know, me too. Good morning. Morning. Heard some pounding coming from your side last night. Get some aggression out? Always. Thanks for the inspiration. Any time. Did you feel that? Feel what? The tension. It's shifting. Oh, stop it. Nothing's shifting. I feel the shift. Hi folks. Nothing is happening. Oh, it's happening. Whoa! Oh, wow. Nice progress. Yeah, you too. I came in to find the upstairs wallpaper gone. Yeah, well I figured I have to give it some elbow grease, too. I have Alan in the master bathroom pulling up the linoleum. Oh, good riddance to that. The 70's called, even they don't miss it. Hey, I need to update you on some of the finishes I'm thinking about. Yeah, sounds good but it's gonna have to wait. I have to run down to City Hall and submit the additional permit application for the kitchen expansion. Hey, I'm going by there right now to meet a client. I can drop that off for you. Oh. Yeah, that would actually be really helpful. Thanks, Terry. No problem. And I will see you tomorrow night. Yes. With lasagne. Yes. What's next? You said 10:30. Ok, ok. I'll just drop this permit application by City Hall and I will be there as soon as I can. Well, well, well, if it isn't my favourite realtor. Oh, besides yourself? I'm flattered. You didn't call me back the other day. There's a reason for that. Which is? I don't wanna talk to you. Ok, how about this? I'll take your application to City Hall. I'm going right by there and it sounds like you are in a rush. I do have a fire to put out. Let me help. Thank you. Hey, I got an idea. Whoever gets the highest bid on these duplexes gets treated to dinner. Deal. I know this great little steak house downtown, I just hope you can afford it. Can't wait. Lance, I'm here! Let's make some money! I want these for the drawers and these for the kitchen cupboards. Classic. Timeless. I looked at every conceivable window covering from drapes to shades to blinds and I found myself always returning to white wood slats. Simple and elegant. So I was debating between a simple white subway tile or the stacked glass to add some sparkle but in the end I decided on tumbled marble for warmth and texture. I don't know, Jules. No, just kidding. It's perfect. Hey, Hal I've got a permit application to drop off on a rush. Ok, uh, just leave it with me and I'll hand it to the inspector. Thanks, pal. Have a good one. Hey. Uh, yes. Knock, knock. Hey. This work site is off limits. No scoping out the competition. As if I need to at this stage of the game, Jules. Well, it's not unlike you to come in here, look around and get a bunch of ideas. This package is for you. It was delivered to my side. I'm guessing... Cabinet hardware. Handles, maybe knobs. Mmm. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried. Why do you look it? I look worried? That's strange, 'cause I'm not. Really? Neither am I. Good. Great. I see you knocked down the wall. Wonder where you got that idea from. Ok, don't flatter yourself, Lance. Open kitchen and dining room spaces are everywhere right now. And it's trend, I'm not copying you. Oh, so you're just copying trend. No, no. I'm not copying anything. I'm just trying to sell a house. Ok, alright. Not copying anyone. If you say so. Just gonna keep my door locked, just in case. Bye, Jules. Bye. This is the one. It's a beautiful floor. Well, at $5.99 a square foot seems kinda steep for manufactured hardwood. Well, no, that's quality. Plus, it comes with a 30-year guarantee, so for $5.99 that's quite the bargain. I could buy it online for $4.00 a square foot. Well, then you should probably do that. Are you running any specials? Not this month but uh, check back in the winter time. That's our slow season. Oh. Is your manager around? You're looking at him, as of six weeks ago. Oh, well my name is Jules. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'm Lance Waddell, Waddell Contracting and Renovation. Oh, sure. Yeah, we all know your dad around here. That's right. So she and I are together. No. We're not. Uh, give me one second. Jules, will you go with me on this? No, I'm not some damsel in distress. I know that but I know how these guys feel about my dad. I'm gonna get us a discount. Yeah. That's exactly what I was about to do. Ok, well- Sorry about that. No worries. So look, we're flipping this house over on Holland Avenue, together, and we just wanted to get some flooring from our favourite guys. Oh, we appreciate the vote of confidence from you and your dad. Of course. Are you guys still offering that 10 percent contractor's discount? That expired a few months back but uh, I think I can give it to you. Right. It's because of his repeat business. Well, no, she also- I may not be a contractor but I do have my own design company, Jules Briggs Designs, I don't know if you've heard of it, and not only have I bought flooring here before for my last two properties, I also referred my cousin, my neighbour, and my optometrist here. I'm sure it's all noted if you check your computer. Now, I don't know about you but I think that qualifies as repeat business so I will happily accept that 10 percent discount as well. Uh, sure. Um, I think I can get you approved as well. Plus, we can save on delivery charges since it's all going to the same address, correct? I'll put you on one invoice so there's a single delivery fee. Perfect. Well, I think that grown man is legitimately frightened of you. Well done. See? I've done a few of these since you and I- well, I know how to take care of myself. I never said you didn't, Jules. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go pick some flooring. You don't know which one you're getting yet? I'm gonna wander the aisles and see which one speaks to me as a person, you know? Half an hour would be great. Yeah, I just got held up at the flooring store and some other errands. Uh huh, yeah, yeah, I'm taking my grandmother's lasagne out of the oven as we speak. Price-check on register 3. I gotta go. See you at 7:00 Grandmother's lasagne, huh? Are you following me? No, I ran out of coffee. Unacceptable with my crew, and this is the nearest grocery store. Is your grandmother, Betty Homemaker? I had every intention of actually cooking a lasagne for tonight. But burning the candle at both ends made that problematic. I'm on like my third candle of the day. Want some advice? If I said no would you still give it? Yep. Go with that one. It's cheesier. The tomato sauce is better. What? I'm a bachelor now. One of those things will last me a while. I bought five of them when they were on sale. I'm good 'til summer. Oh, so you're gonna be here until summer? Why would you ask that? I don't know, I guess it's because you've left before. I know. I'm thinking of setting down some roots. My opportunity seems to be here. Things weren't so great in Portland, I tried. I wasn't the one-man show that I thought I'd be. Just ended up working on a crew there. A lot of competition for contractors. I'm sorry, I-I didn't realize that. I don't advertise it. Just like you don't advertise serving frozen lasagne. Ha. Well, speaking of, I do need to go put that in the oven like, now. You never saw me. My lips are sealed. I love it out here. It's so relaxing. Yeah, isn't it? This is so good. But it reminds me of something. I know. What does it taste like? I can't quite put my finger on it but it tastes like... Ok, ok, it tastes like store bought because it is store bought! I'm so sorry that I tried to pass it off as my grandmother's. It's just-I'm so tapped out, you guys. Ok, first of all, we're not mad. Are you mad? No, not at all. And second of all, there's no such thing as bad lasagne. I'm sure your grandma's recipe is amazing, but we can take a rain cheque until the flip and the Home and Garden show are all over with. Thank you. I know, and I have to start getting things ready for the booth. We set up next week. Yeah, I'll have my booth there, too, so I can help you. And I have plenty of staff at the cafe so I can cover at the booth while you're at the job site. I really appreciate it, you guys. And Terry's right. There's no such thing as bad lasagne. Lance said this was the best one. Lance? Oh, Lance said that? - Huh. - Interesting. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It wasn't like that. We just ran into each other at the grocery store. Huh. Very nice. You know, he was talking about settling down roots in Bedford. With you? No, not with me. Listen, I've heard this before from him. I thought it was forever between us but, you know, he had a different idea. I doubt he's changed that much. But you hope so? No. I don't know. What I do know is that this flip could give me the means to establish myself as a full-time designer and that's where my focus should be right now. Well, cheers to that, sister. Wow! This is even bigger than last year. Yeah. Are you in the South Pavilion with me? West Pavilion with my mom. Ok. Looks like we're going that way. This convention is really gonna help your career, trust me. After last year my business has never been better. Oh, I hope so. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello ladies. Richard. Three weeks to go, Terry. I'm feeling optimistic. I wouldn't hold your breath. See you soon. So this is me. Great. Forever my neighbour. Can't get away from me if you tried. Excuse me? Excuse me, could I talk to the two of you? Some people over there were talking about your duelling duplex so I just had to come see this for myself. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm Elsie Baxter. Hi. Features editor of Innovative Designs magazine. We put on this event. Oh, I read your magazine all the time. Oh. Yeah, we actually advertise in it. Not bad for a regional magazine, right? No, this event is great for local businesses. My mom's nursery has been involved for years. Are you familiar with our feature 'This Month's Flip'? It's the best. I love it. So what if we really made this a competition with a vote on the last day of the show. Attendees get to choose their favourite side of the duplex and the winner gets to be This Month's Flip for next month? Ok, well that sounds incredible but that would only give us another eight days to finish. We were counting on about twice that. Right. I can do it. Well then, so can I. Wonderful. I'm going to talk to my team and make arrangements. Ok, bye. Huh. Look at you bending. This is crazy, you know? We're crazy. Speak for yourself. I think we can do it. It's the same job, just accelerated. How did a simple little wager between us become a potential magazine spread? Don't forget the online exposure. Right, how could I? Come on, get your head in the game. My dad and I spent a lot on advertising and this kind of publicity is priceless. Yeah, but breaking the news to Kenny's gonna cost me a ton. Yeah, I don't envy you on that one. Eight days isn't a lot but I'm choosing to focus on the benefits, you know? For when I win. Yeah, me too. For when I win. Eight days, Jules? You know I really needed every single day. I know, but I spoke to my mother and she's gonna have some of her friends help her at the shop. I am on this flip 24/7. That'll help out some and I can get a rush on the cabinets but it's gonna cost you. I know. I'll dip into savings. This could really get our names out there. Well, eight days. Let's get to work. Yeah. So look, I'm repurposing this old door and turning it into a bookshelf. Kinda like I did with this crib swing. What do you think? Oh yeah, your mom used to sit and read in this for hours. Hey, you should put this in the back yard of the duplex. It might help with the sale. Nah. Then they'll expect it to come with the house. So... only eight more days. I'm afraid so, but I'm gonna get it done. After all, this is Waddell Contracting and Renovations we're talking about here. Aha! That's how I know I'm leaving this business in capable hands. Let's not over shoot, pop. I'm not done yet. But if I do get this right I think this duplex will put me on the map. We're already on the map. No, you're on the map. Once this business is just me I wanna make sure people are ok with that. I did everything I could to try to find contracting work in Portland but guys like me are a dime a dozen out there. You wanna hear about my first solo jobs? Because it's not pretty. Pop, can I just grow up to be half as good as you? What're you talking about? You're better. Of course you may wanna get in good with the town if you want them to vote your way and Jules is very well-liked around here. You've been gone a couple years. I guess it is kind of a popularity contest, huh? It can be. And you're the face of this project. You need to show your face. Yeah. Hey, Lance. Hi Kat, how are you? Good. What can I get for you? Iced tea to go, please. Alright. Just out and about seeing the people. On a break from the duplex, which is going great, by the way. Hi, ladies. Wow. Very subtle. Oh, hi Jules, didn't see you there. Just be yourself. Interesting advice seeing as you're not such a big fan of myself. Nah, you're ok, when you listen to what I have to say. Hey Lance, you collect old wood, right? Do you want the picnic tables out back? Oh, you're getting rid of those? Yeah, they're so old and every time people sit on them they just get splinters. Well hey, anything can get restored. Why don't I sand them for ya? Throw a stain on them? Really? You-you would do that? Yeah, happy to. That way you can keep them out there. Yeah, I mean, that would be great if you don't mind. I mean, of course I wouldn't expect you to do it 'til after the show. I'll get on it as soon as I'm done. Great. Thank you, Lance. I like him. Better? Exponentially. Good. Goodbye, ladies. What? Hey, Jules? We still need a permit for the kitchen expansion. Have you heard anything? No, but I'll call and check on the status. Ok. Hey, yeah. No, it should be on its way soon. Lance, It's so good to see you. Naomi, what are you doing here? Don't worry, I'm here to help. Uh-huh. Honestly though, Lance, you should listen to me now. Right. I could do a lot with this yard? Come on now, Lance, admit it. You need me. Great! Alan, here you are. I uh, I was standing here waiting for you and, well, there you are. Well done. Oh, hi. Um, I was just here waiting for Alan. Ok. Jules, this is uh, Naomi. She's a- His ex. Landscape architect. Also my ex. We dated for a bit in Portland. Until she broke up with me. I would say a year is a little more than a bit, Lance. Right. Ok. We met on a job site, you know, the old fairy tale. Landscaping is not his strong suit. So, when I heard about the competition on the Innovative Design website, I had to come to his rescue. Well, it's good to meet you. Right. Oh, I'm sorry, I was painting. You can use my shirt. Thanks. So we should definitely talk about the yard. Well, Jules is experienced in landscaping, as well. Oh. Both of you are both very good at landscaping. Well, I love it. I love doing it. I love doing it, too. Ok, I think that uh... Yeah, I think I'm gonna go back to painting. And uh-Oh, um, it's so good to meet you. So great. Great. Alan?! Ok. Ok, thank you. Please let me know as soon as you find out. I'm just running out of time here. Ok, thanks. What was that? They can't find our permit application. This has never happened to me before. I- I'm sure it's down there. You know how disorganized they can be. Yeah, but still. Well, we're gonna need that permit before an inspector shows up. I know. And we can't afford any more problems. I'm just digging up the old, I'm not replacing anything. I wouldn't wanna make any decisions without Naomi weighing in. I didn't ask her to come here. And yet she still did. Look, we don't need a second opinion. I've got this. I know. Anyway, I told her that. So that's that? Yeah, that's that. Hey, Jimmy, are we rolling? Ok. Don't mind us, we just wanna get a little footage to put on the Innovative Designs website. We're expanding our website with video features now. Oh, we won't give anything away before the big reveal but it'll get people to come to the show. Make sure you get the front of both sides separately, yeah? I would love to get an interview with you as well, just something short and sweet if you don't mind. Well I'm kind of a mess, I- Oh, even better. You're in the trenches digging in the dirt, getting it done. But you look good doing it. And welcome to the special Innovative Designs feature that we're calling "Two Sides, One Coin". This challenge pits contractor Lance Waddell against local florist slash house designer, Jules Briggs. Each is in the process of renovating one side of this duplex and you get to vote online to choose your favourite. The lucky winner will be featured as This Month's Flip next issue. Jules, tell us about your vision. Well, I'm going for a modern farmhouse design with a contemporary cozy aesthetic. Warm and light and soft, and because I personally love flowers there will be floral touches throughout, as well. Oh, charming. And what about you, Lance? Well, I like approachable industrial design that celebrates natural materials, earthy colours, and the elimination of unnecessary detail. Well, we've always had very different takes on aesthetics. So you've done this sort of competition thing before? No. Well, once we flipped a house together but we're not together anymore. But you were once together, like, together together? A very long time ago, yeah? So this is a little more than just a professional rivalry. No. No, no, no. This is strictly professional. Definitely. It's professional. And the plot thickens. And there you have it, folks. Personal or professional? On the last day of Innovative Designs Home and Garden show we will be revealing the finished product and you will get to decide who the big winner is. Will it be Jules Briggs? Uh, yes. I'm going to beat him. Or Lance Waddell? You can bet on it. And cut. You guys were great. When we start it, Mike, it'll be over in like five minutes. Thanks, buddy. Hey. I uh, was wondering if you can take a look at something? Come on in. What is it? It's plans for the front. I'm guessing now that you told Naomi to get lost you trust me when it comes to the landscaping. Let me take a look before I commit. So what's the deal with that Naomi, anyway? What do you mean? I just... I don't know, I don't see you with her. Well, that's probably why I'm not with her. I thought you said she broke up with you. Well, look who's paying attention. So, the plans, what do you think? I don't wanna make any decisions without you. Well, let me run it by Naomi. She might have some thoughts, you know. She is a professional- Jules, it's a joke. No, yeah, I know. You are not funny. I'm a little bit funny. Are you, though? What're you doing? You can't paint in the rain. Just sampling some colours. I wanted to get your thoughts. Don't say anything until you've taken a look. What is that? Does that colour even have a name? This is the colour blue. It's interesting. Is it, though? I mean, take a good long look at it. I mean-maybe rethink it. Ok, would you consider a sophisticated grey? Let's see. Boring, dull, uninspired grey. What would that look like? Fine. A grey-ish blue. It's a combination of both. We could split the difference. Grey says harmony, balance and growth. You're kidding, right? What? Colours have meaning. The flooring is here. Nice. Hi. I've got a delivery for Jules Briggs. Yes, that's me. Is that for both orders? It's one invoice, but the boxes are clearly marked. Great. Well, you can place them inside. Unit A is on the left, B is on the right. Ok. I just need your signature. Of course. Thanks. And that's for you. Great, thank you. Look. See, see, this family is soft and inviting. And this is cool and welcoming. What's your point? Well, my point is we want it to say something. And what exactly do we want it to say, Jules? I'm so hungry. Strange thing to say. No, like I-I literally haven't had a bite to eat all day. You just gotta keep up better. I'm trying. You're a little all over the place. Maybe a little hangry, too? Remember our rule? No decisions on an empty stomach Exactly. No more colour talk until your blood sugar level stabilizes, alright? Come on, I gotta go back to the shop anyway to get some stuff. We'll get food on the way. Alright, let me tell Kenny to start installing the floors. Alright. You were right. I needed this. I am no longer hangry. I am full-tent. What is that? Full and content? Uh... No? Doesn't work? I don't think that's gonna stick. Hmm. This is relaxing. Meditative. In fact, I think this might be the first time I've relaxed in a month. We'll all get some sleep when this is over. Just a couple more days. You know, winning is the furthest thing away from my mind right now? I just want it to be good. And done. It's gonna be great, Jules. You really do have a knack for this. Hmph. Yeah, I think that's the only thing I ever wanted to hear from you back then. That I was good at this. I never said it? Mmm-mmm. No. I thought it. I thought it a lot. I thought-well, I think the same thing about you. And this swing you made for your mom? It's incredible. You turned this crib into this. You know, you could sell this. No, I'm not gonna sell this. This was hers. I understand. You know, I kept that barrel you turned into a wine rack. You kept that? - Mmmhmm. - Really? - Mmmhmm. - After everything? Well, I contemplated selling it because I was mad at you, but I needed somewhere to put my wine. Right. What you do is art. I'm a contractor, Jules. I'm not an artist. Why can't you be both? 'Cause it's not what we do at Waddell. We buy properties, we renovate 'em. We. But what about when it's just you? I mean, this distinguishes you. What you build puts you on the map. You just-you have to put it out there. I think people have a certain expectation of our work. Well, you're gonna have to be willing to bend, Lance. I bend. I bend, ok? I bend more than anyone bends. That's debatable. Ok. All I'm saying is try to incorporate what you do into your flips. Then there's no one who wouldn't come to Lance Waddell. I don't know, it's risky. You took a risk once. Going to Portland, going out on your own. That wasn't a risk, Jules. I was running. My mom had been gone a year, my dad was selling the house and honestly I thought that we were gonna hit it out of the park with that flip. But I let you down. I hated disappointing you. I know I didn't communicate that very well but... I thought you blamed me. All you said is it's not working out and you need a fresh start. I know. I'm sorry. It wasn't you I was running from. I might be ok with a blue-ish grey paint if it says all the things we want it to. What do we want it to say, again? Make me an offer? Right. Over the asking price. Mmmhmm. So blue-ish grey it is? Blue-ish grey it is. Ok, so I was thinking about the front doors and I think they should be the same. How do you feel about wooden doors with stained glass? Well... Ok, we'll talk about it. Alright. Uh... Lance, why is half your floor installed on my side? They mixed up our orders! Urgh! But Jack, we have the correct numbers on the original invoice. I understand that, but you signed this form upon delivery that you inspected the materials and that everything was correct. Yes, but this is your mistake. And then it was yours when you didn't verify the delivery. However, we can get an order to you in two days if you let me know exactly how many square feet you need to replace. With the 10 percent contractor's discount again? Of course. Let me go write it up. This is for unit A? B! Yep, still terrified. This is my fault. I know to check boxes. And I'm paying to replace your floors. I'm not gonna let you do that. Well, I pay for my mistakes, Lance. I could have just as easily been the one to sign that form without checking, believe me. It doesn't matter. The fact is it was me. And if I spend less time arguing with you and more time on my attention to detail we wouldn't be in this mess. It's just... you bring that side out in me, you always have. Oh, di-di-di-n-n-n-n- I'm paying for your replacement floors. There you go. Here you are. How's it going, ladies? Opening day is always the busiest. Oh yeah, we've gotten some great responses so far. This is so exciting. - Here we go, pop. - Yep. - Got it. - One, two... Jules, do you have something prepared for the floral presentation tonight? Uh, no, but I think I'll just come up with something once I'm up there. What? It's a litmus test to see who responds to my... art. Mmm. Hi, everyone. I'm Alice from Alice's Florals and tonight my daughter, Jules, is gonna do a little demonstration on floral arranging for spring. Thank you. Thanks, mom. So I practically grew up in a flower shop so plants are second nature to me. However, flower arranging can sometimes be intimidating. Now, I'm gonna need a volunteer. - That's you. - No. Oh, you, sir. Why don't you come up? Come on, Lance. Get up there. Nothing to be afraid of, all you have to do is just follow some simple instructions that I give you. Follow instructions from you... absolutely. I'm really gonna enjoy this. I bet you are. When designing an arrangement, we follow specific steps. Proportion. We make sure our pairing fits well together. Then balance and harmony. Harmony is always good. When things belong together it's evident. Next is colour. As long as it's not shockingly blue. Your colour should represent exactly how you're feeling. They're doing the dance. Oh, please. They've been doing the dance for weeks. Lastly, texture. Always make sure it feels right. The perfect bloom to top it off. Well done. You got it. No, wait, keep them. It's your handiwork. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Lance Waddell and Jules Briggs of the Duplex Challenge. Check out their booths and in six days they'll reveal their work and you can vote for the best flip. Now that swing is something else. Gerard. Evening, Ed. Hey. How come you never told me you make pieces like this? Oh, because I don't. It's all him. Gerard Banks, Banks Furniture, meet my son, Lance. Nice to meet you, I drive by your store all the time. Next time come in. If you've got any more pieces like this bring them in. I could sell a piece like that in a heartbeat. We don't um... that was just a sample that I did. Well, you got any extra samples, send them my way. Good to see you, Ed. Good to see you. Thanks, Gerard. It's not here. I have permits for electrical, plumbing, sewer line, but there's no record of a permit being pulled for a kitchen expansion. I know how it looks. Yeah. So do I. But I don't cut corners. Everything's up to code and the application was submitted. I have no record of an application and you have no permit. That means everybody here goes home. Work stops until I see a permit. Ethan, that's gonna take like 48 hours. We don't have that kind of time. All work stops. Got a couple more invoices. What's wrong? It's gonna take 48 hours to get us a new permit. Complete work stoppage until it clears. You got tagged? Yes. You wanna tell me why my permit application was never filed? It was. I dropped it off with Hal. Did you? Of course, he did. You did, right? Yeah. Ok, look. I don't know what happened but we'll get it fixed. We'll get you a retroactive permit on the rush. Yes, Kenny is down there trying to do that. So how did this happen? I don't know, Jules. I am so sorry. I'm gonna find out right now, ok? Please tell me this isn't what it looks like. It's not. There's nothing nefarious going on here. I wouldn't do that to you just to win, or to anyone for that matter. I would hope not. Look, it's only 48 hours, right? Yes, but it's four days until voting. You can get it done. Only if my luck changes. Still nothing from Kenny? It's been 48 hours. No. Well, at least the landscaping's on schedule. At this point we'll have exactly two days to finish painting. That's if the permit comes through today. Well, lucky for you I'm a wiz with the paint brush. Fastest brush in the west. Well, you're gonna have to be. And then some. Kenny just called! The inspector has the permit, work hold has been lifted, we can start painting right now. Oh, finally. Congratulations, you did it. - Let's get on it. - Yeah. You were saying? It's supposed to let up by tomorrow which gives us two days, maybe. The biggest opportunity to go out on my own, with free publicity to boot. The headline will say "Epic fail, couldn't get it done". Come on. So things aren't going according to plan. It's not like you to give up. We just gotta improvise. We? Yeah. We. This thing isn't done 'til 1:00 pm Friday so turn that frown upside down. I don't frown. Ok, an aggressive pout, then. That's better. You're right. I'm already at rock bottom. What else can go wrong? So much for my electrical upgrade. That's good, right? Mmmhmm. I'm sure I haven't had Lun Wah since... well, it's been a while. Yeah, I missed it a lot when I was in Portland. No good Moo Shu there. No? Hey, I hope that the help that you've given me hasn't set you back too much. Nah, we'll finish. I'll hire extra crew if I have to. Yeah, well, crews cost money. I know. I'll think of something, Jules. You don't have to do that. This is my problem, too, and like you said, we're in this together. It's kinda different from the last time, isn't it? You and I coming up with solutions together. Yeah, well maybe that was our problem. We were more against each other back then when we were supposed to be a team. Stubborn as a couple mules. Well, some of us more than others. Yeah, that's fair. You were so very much worse than me. What's so great about you, Jules is you never gave up. Never backed down and you're not gonna do that now. It keeps me going. I never knew you thought that about me. I think you're exceptional, and I should have told you. So what's changed? We're older. Wiser. Made our mistakes. I should have never have left. We lost too much on that flip, you know? No, we didn't lose, we broke even. No, it was a loss. I'm not gonna let that happen again. Ok. You can answer that now. I appreciate the follow-through. Yeah, you know. Hey, Kenny. Really? Ok, can you-can you hold on a second? It's ok. I gotta get back to work anyways. Get your call. Hey. Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Still on rain delay. Yeah, afraid so. And I'm out of candles. I guess I better head back to the shop and uh, finish up those cabinets. Yeah, I'm gonna head to the Home and Garden show for a bit. Ok. Stay dry. You too. It sounds like this rain is never gonna quit. Well, it's supposed to clear up by tomorrow morning. That gives you one day to paint an entire house. I'll have Jules' crew, too. Are they done with her interior? Working on it. You have got to hire a top-notch crew of painters to get this done in time, my friend. Costs money, pal. Ask your dad? This is my problem, not his. I do not want to let her down again. I'm hoping it comes in this afternoon. I hope so. Oh, thank you, Kat. Unfortunately, I'm gonna need a lot more than caffeine. There's no way we're gonna finish painting this house in one day with my skeleton crew. Well, I'll help you. And I'm sure Richard will come, too. And we can get your mom. Really? You would do that? Yeah. Well, it's a house, it's not like you need to be Picasso. And I'll help you. Anyone would. Trust me. Watch this. Hey, everyone! Who can paint and would be willing to clear their schedule to help Jules and Lance finish the duplex challenge? Exterior only, no peeking inside. That's like eight people. We can do this. Ok. Ok, yeah. This might work. I'm gonna go run this by Lance and-and I will be back. Thank you, everyone! Yeah. Oh, your coffee. Make sure you edge around that window. Double up, even. Get behind that drain pipe, too. It's gotta be perfect, man. No, no, no. What-Lance, what're you doing? We can't afford this. It's ok. Don't worry about the money. I'm covering it. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is my responsibility, too. It's alright, I figured it out for us. Without talking to me? I thought we were past this. Acting on your impulses, making expensive decisions that can't be undone. I didn't think that uh- Yeah, exactly, you didn't think. Look, I had a viable solution and I was coming to talk to you about it because that's what you do when you're in it together. You come to an agreement. One that doesn't spend the money I don't have. No, Jules, you don't have to pay me back. Of course, I do. Ok, look. It's getting painted now, right? Honestly, I thought that you would be happy. And I thought we were becoming a team. But we're not. And that was always our problem. Jules... I would have given you the money, you know? Nah, I wouldn't ask you for it. I took on this challenge on my own, I needed to see it through on my own, with no handouts. Did you make some good money selling your mom's stuff? Yeah, great money, actually. So what do you think about adding some personal touches to these flips? I know people are used to a certain classic uniform aesthetic but uh... Yeah, but I only do that because I don't have your talent. I mean, I can design and execute a renovation but I can't do what you do, and I can't think of a better debut than a property with a little Lance Waddell flair. I think it'll help sell the place. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. I think I messed up again, pop. With the duplex? No, Jules. I can't seem to do the right thing, you know? I'm sure you can. How so? Apologize. Listen. Just really hear her. Great, now you tell me. Ah, it's never too late son. Never too late. You did it again, Kenny. This is all your vision, Jules. I'm just the one executing it. And I think we have a winner. I hope so. He seems way behind. Hopefully he can get it done. The magazine people are here. It's that time! We're ready to get our footage. But please, be careful, the exterior paint may still be wet. Oh, that's not a problem. It'll photograph well and that's all that matters. Hi, hi. Hi, Elsie, can I possibly maybe please have a couple more hours? Almost there. 3:00 latest. Can you be done by then, because it's really pushing it. Yeah, I can be done. Ok, we'll be back at 3:00 to film both of you. Ok. But I have to say, Lance, in the interest of this competition where you're at at the time is how we photograph you. No more extensions. Yeah. No more extensions. Thank you. Mark, bring in the rest of these cabinet doors! Ok, see you at 3:00. See you at 3:00. - Yes. - Thanks. What's the matter, honey? Lance is very behind. They extended us to 3:00 pm. I feel kinda bad for him. He worked so hard. Well, so why are you so mad at him? Well, I'm not mad at him, it's just... it felt like before all over again. You know, he gets this big idea, he just jumps into it without even talking to me about it. It felt like we were finally becoming a team. That's what a teammate or partner does, they-they come through for each other in a pinch. When you love someone all you wanna do is make things better for them. You two didn't do that for each other before. Maybe this is just him learning from his mistakes. Hey, Jules. Good luck today. Thanks, Ed. Look, I know my son can be... tricky. But he really did just wanna help out. He wouldn't have sold the furniture otherwise. What furniture? Those pieces he made for his mother years ago. They meant a lot to him. Oh... thank you, Ed. I have to go. Alright, you have 15 minutes before Elsie gets here. Where do you want this? I was thinking right beside the French doors. That's what I was thinking. I like this, by the way. Oh yeah, it's beautiful. Alright, let's move it! We have a job to finish! Come on in. Let's hop to it!

And for those of you watching online thanks for tuning in. Thank you. And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The reveal of our flip challenge. This is what the duplex looked like just six short weeks ago. Fast forward to today and you will not believe the incredible results. Jules or Lance? Let's go take a look. Are you all ready? Hi there. Come on in. Come on. Wow. Isn't this absolutely stunning? And look at this kitchen. Wow. When I discovered this amazing mural I knew it was just what I needed to set the tone for the entire home. I think I achieved what I set out to do. Create a fresh take on a farmhouse aesthetic. Warm, welcoming and comfortable. Well, I could certainly see myself living here. This is going to be a tough act to follow. And there's more! Jules' side of the duplex is filled with her signature style. Bright clean designs that still feel cozy and comfortable. A beautiful renovation from top to bottom. I'll admit it is spectacular but don't make up your minds just yet. Let's see what Lance has in store for us. Come on. Yeah Lance! Hello, and welcome to your beautiful home. Come on in. Oh, wow. Isn't this exciting? Here we go. Clean lines, earthy tones and natural textures create a sense of order, calm. These coppered cabinets have been patina-ed for a retro feel. I've made a space that has an organic flow with architectural interest. I'm feeling more centred already. Woooo!!! All I can say is I'm glad you're the ones deciding and not me. Whew! Now let's see what he did with the rest of the house. Lance's side of the duplex incorporates elements of his artistic design. Upcycling older pieces to creae something bold, beautiful and impossible to find anywhere else. There it is, folks. One duplex, two astonishing but very different flips. Now it's all up to you. You got this! Yeah, Lance! Please visit our voting booths located in any of the pavilions and be sure to choose your favourite. And for those of you online, voting is now open. We'll be back at 7:00 to reveal the winner of the grand prize. The Flip of the Month spread in Innovative Designs magazine! How'd it go? Good, and you? Good. Who'd you vote for? It's supposed to be a secret, isn't it? I don't think so. Good. Because I voted for you. No, you did not. I did. Good, 'cause I voted for you. Stop it. It's true. Everybody, please take your seats. We're ready to announce the results. With a total of 16,408 votes between the show and online voting I'm happy to announce that the winner, by a margin of only nine votes is... Jules Briggs! Go Jules, yes! Yes, absolutely. Congratulations. I don't deserve it any more than you do. Well... And I'm sorry for getting so upset. I know your intentions were good. But we tell each other everything from now on. From now on? Mmmhmm. Well, in that case uh, there's something I gotta tell you. I could have gone above $150,000 on your side of the duplex. Why didn't you? You seemed like you really wanted it. Yeah. Maybe I wanted you nearby. Well, it did kinda save the day. Yeah, you really did. You sold your mom's furniture.
