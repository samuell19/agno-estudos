I need to get some of that stuff. Now, uh, where can I buy it? -Hey, man, you can't buy it.

What will it be when you hear your brother's voice cry out for you? Do you turn and walk away? Is the price too much to pay? Or do brother's always stay and see it through? It's up to you what will be. -OK, that's the big stuff. [LOUD MACHINERY] -But I have to use your ambulance. -My ambulance? Hey, you can't take my ambulance. -Hey, go get the ambulance. -Hey, what am I gonna tell my boss? -I don't know. Call him and tell him it's making funny noises.

I would have tuned it up! -It didn't need no tuning up. -You know something? If I'd have known that you was going to start complaining, I would have never even let you drive. In fact, I wouldn't even have brought you along. -Look, man. Don't you understand I'm responsible for this thing? -Just hurry it up, would ya? -What's the hurry? -Well, you're right.

CHIP: Yes, but it's a lot less than $800,000 you owe in back taxes. CHIP: Will your boy take, um, treasury notes? -What treasury notes, Leon? I have enough to do with these-- what is this? Leon, you got to have over $1 million worth, here. No, no, no. It's not going to do. We're gonna have to list these as assets. -Now, w-wait a minute, Chester. I'm not exactly, um, supposed to have those. -Leon, are these hot? -I paid $0.10 on the dollar for those things! I'll let your boy have it for, um, $0.20. -Leon, my boy only deals in cash. These things have got serial numbers on them, and you've got the money in the safe, Leon. -Chester, I'm a trader. That's what I do. I buy things and I sell things. Just see if your boy will go for it. If he won't, then I'll get into that rainy day money. What is it, Larry? -Uh, Leon.

When I go to jail, I want to know why. TOMMY: That's my brother, Joe Hawkins. JAY: Joe Hawkins, the singer? TOMMY: Yeah. JAY: Oh! I'm going to jail! First for stealing. Now I'm going to jail when your brother-- [WOLF HOWLING] [KNOCKING] JAY: I ain't getting out! -Open the door. JAY: Shit! I ain't coming out there. These is woods out there! -So what? JAY: There's creatures in these woods. -Will you open the damn door and help me get him out there? We're not in a-- not going into a cave. We're going into a cabin! [WOLF HOWLING] -I told ya! Me and the woods don't get along! [OWL HOOTING] Damn! You broke my damn car! Oh, ho! Look at my car! Who's gonna pay for all this? Look at it! You broke it! Where's my mirror? Look at the lights! Who-- how can I take this back to work? This was my responsibility! Who's gonna fix it! -Will you calm down? Now listen, me and the boys fixed it before. Me and the boys will fix it again. Trust me. -Leon, this is the chief of police. And listen, you better talk to this man, 'cause he is hot. -Larry, I can't talk. Tell me, right now. Tell him I'm not here. No, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Tell him, uh, tell him it was a promotional stunt. Tell him, uh, that, uh, Joe's new album is going to be, uh, uh, uh, "Stolen." Yeah. -Yes, sir. Uh, well, you see, this was-- it was just a publicity stunt to promote this new record. Uh, huh. 'Cause you see, uh, Joe's new album is going to be called "Stolen." Yes, sir. That's what I said, "Stolen," uh huh. Well, now I-- but I'm sure Mr. Redden would be more than glad to pay for everything. -Pay? -Yes, sir. I'll tell him. I'll tell him, I will. -What he say, Larry? -He said they busted up a bunch of police cars, and that this was the last time. And if anything like this ever happens again, somebody's going to jail. [SIGH] -Do you know what the hell you're doing? -Yeah. Yeah, I called a doctor last night and he explained-- -Doctor, my ass. Give me that. I was mainlining scag when I was only 14. -Scag? -Horse. -Horse? -Heroin. -You a dope addict? -Was, baby. Was. Now squeeze me up a vein down there. Go ahead, squeeze it up. [DOOR CLOSING] -I'll take the ambulance back. You stay here. -No, I'll take the ambulance back. You stay here. -You can't. I've got to go by the garage and leave a note for the guys to repair it. I'll see ya in the morning. -You ain't coming back till morning? I'm coming with you. -And who's going to look after Joe? Huh? Now I'm telling you, you'd be perfectly safe here. -But what if some big, hair creature comes crawling in here out of the woods? -There ain't no big, hair creature in these woods. And even if there were, they're not gonna come in here. Give me. -But what if they do? -Lock the door. [OWL HOOTING] -No. You can't allow these things to fester. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. -That's right. -Now you watch this, Larry. And ya learn something. -All right. -Now watch how a man runs an organization, Larry. [KNOCKING] -What do you want? -Larry, you wait out here. -I said, what do you want? -You and me need to talk. -We ain't got nothing to talk about. -Where's Joe? -Get off my property, or I'm going to call the police. -Oh, darling. There ain't no point in calling the police, unless you want to explain to 'em why your husband kidnapped Joe. -He didn't kidnap Joe. -No matter what you say, the police are gonna say it's a kidnapping. -I'm gonna ask you two for the last time to get off my property. -All right. All right, we'll get off your property. And I'll tell you what else I'll do. I'm going to give them 12 hours. Now if Joe is not standing in my office by noon tomorrow-- I'm gonna have Tome arrested. -Way to go, boss. -Agh! I -Hey, calm down! Relax, now! Take it easy. Hey, hey. Tell me now, how you feeling? -Not worth a damn, thank you. Who are you? -I'm Big Jay. -You're Big Jay? -Yeah. That's right. -Well, Big Jay, do me a favor. Go get Larry and tell him to come in here. Uh, and help me get my day started. He'll know what I mean. -I don't know no Larry. But how about a nice cup of coffee to get your day started? -I don't want any cof-- I don't want any coffee! I want Larry! How did you-- oh! -'Bout time you got here. I'm gonna be late for work. -How's Joe? -He's hurting real bad. -Well, can ya-- can ya give him another shot? -Nah. We can only give him that stuff once every 12 hours. -Look, Jay. I have to ask you another favor. How about staying up here with me a couple days and helping me with him. -Man, you think I can just move up here? I got alimony payments to three of the meanest women in the world. -I'll take care of 'em. -Well, what about my part-time business? -I'll buy your book. -Hey, you're forgetting, man, I need my job. -I kinda took care of that, too. -You-- you kinda took care of that? What the hell does that mean? -Well, told 'em you had to go to Cleveland because there's someone sick in your family. -You been setting me up all along, ain't you? -Hey, Jay. Now don't lose it. -Why I'll-- man, I'm gonna kill you when I get you! Damn you, Tom! -Now, Jay. Jay, keep your cool. -Hi, Amanda. AMANDA: Hi. -Any news? -No, nothing yet. -Mm. -Hey, have you got Tom's home phone number? -Oh, yeah. I-- I think so, somewhere. This thing's a mess. The girl who used to work here filed everything under the first name. There! -Hello, dear. If this man calls, I cannot make the luncheon. -Right. [SNICKERING] -Who's that? -Oh, Chester something. Some new accountant Leon hired. A weird guy. Gives me the creeps. -Why did Leon hire another accountant? -You didn't know? -What? -He fired Emma. -He what? -Fired her. -Why? -He said she was juggling the books. -[SCOFFS] Yeah! -Where is Joe? What time is it? -11:32. -Well, I ain't gonna wait any longer. Get Tina to bring the limousine around here. You, fix them books. You, come with me. -Oh. Oh, hello, Mr. Smith. How are you? It's nice to see ya. Oh, Mr. Smith, I got a-- I got a phone message for you here. It was a young lady. A young lady called you and-- and-- uh, it's-- that's the number. I took it right down there. You can read that, can't you? And she-- it sounds real urgent. If you'd call her, I think she'd like to hear from ya. -Uh, got change for $1? -What say ya? -Got change for $1? I want to use the phone. -Oh, you want to use the phone. -Yes, sir. -Well, here's a dime. MALONE: What can I do for you, Mr, uh-- LEON: Redden MALONE: Redden. -Leon Redden. -Leon Redden. -I need ya to find somebody for me. -Oh. Who we looking for? -Joe Hawkins. -The singer? -Right. His brother kidnapped him. I don't know why and I don't care why. All I know is, that everyday Joe is gone I'm losing a pot load of money. Now here's a picture of Tom. That's the brother. Give him his address. And, uh, here's Joe. And, uh, here's another one of Tom. -Mm, hm. -You reckon you can find him for me? -Oh, sure. We'll find him. I'll put one of my best men on the case. -You got people working for you, here? -Of course. Right behind that door there's a big staff. Now then, we guarantee our results. If we don't do what you want, you get your money back. That's going to cost you $300 a day. Three days in advance. Plus expenses. -And how much is that gonna be? -$300. -I'd quit while I was ahead, if I was you. -Oh. Uh, huh. Uh, Hamilton, drop everything. I have a new case for ya. Now, Mr. Redden, you have come to the right man. -Well, Mr. Malone, I'm feeling better already. -Oh, that's nice. -When I got to the store, I had this message from my wife to, uh, Nancy Kay. Now that's, uh, that's Joe's agent. So she-- she starts asking me all these questions, you know. About, uh, you know, how's Joe doing? Uh, how's he feeling? And so I told her that, uh, he was doing fine and everything. And then she asked me, could she come up and see him? And I told her, no. -Why? It-- maybe she can cook, 'cause you sure as hell can't. -Hold it, Malone! -There now. For another $2 I'll change your history grade to a B. [TAPPING ON KEYBOARD] -Next. What do you want, Malone? Can't you see I'm busy? -I'd like some information. -Well, the go-go's won't make it this time, sweets. What can I do for ya? -Can you tap into the telephone company computer, the one that handles billing? -Is that all? -Hey. [HEAVY BREATHING] -Come on, man. You got to eat something. -Tommy, just leave me to hell alone. -I can't, because I love ya and I want to help ya. -I don't need any damn help! I was doing fine till you showed up the other day. TOMMY: Can't you see, the pills and the booze are ruining your life? -Qu-- quit talking to me about my life! Until you walked in my shoes, Tommy. You don't what it's like getting on that stage every day. Be funny, Joe. Sing, Joe. Play the guitar, Joe. Write some songs, Joe. OK, I take a few drinks and I take a few pills. But I need a little help. Can you understand that? -Oh, yeah. I can understand that, because I have friends of mine in Vietnam who just-- -Oh! -Well, wait a minute. I'd look around and they'd be dead, because they want pills and booze. Sure, I can understand that. But can you understand that they are using you? JOE: Nobody's using me! TOMMY: What about Leon? JOE: What about him? -Well, they stand you up on the stage and make you take the pills and the booze so you can stay on your feet! And you don't even know what's going on! -Shut up about Leon, Tommy! He's the best friend I've ever had. And he's run my business for 25 years. Including the business of getting you through college and putting you in the racing game. That's what Leon has done. -I'll tell you what Leon has done, Joe. He's turned you into an alcoholic. -Don't sat that to me again, Tommy. -That's what your are, Joe. -Shut up, Tommy! Tommy. Is that the way brothers are supposed to act? [DOOR CLOSING] -Hey, forget about what he did in there. He didn't mean nothing by it. He's hurting real bad. It will pass. [SIGH] I saw so many guys like that. But when it's your own brother, damn, boy, it hurts. -Hey, I was just thinking. You know that chick you called from the store the other day? -Nancy? -Yeah, that's the one. Why don't you invite her up for a couple of days? Might do old Joe some good, having a nice looking babe running around. -I'll see what she says. -Mm, hm. Boy, I like that. Hm. Mm, hm. Oh, I don't know. What do you think, chief? -I think you better get your foot off my desk. [PHONE RINGING] -Yeah? -Malone, here. Um, I think the guys are holed up in Lutrell. -Where in the hell is that? -That's a couple of hundred miles from here. -Well, how do you know they're there? -The brother's wife made a couple of calls to a little mom and pop grocery store outside of town. Want me to check it out? -Well, hell yeah, check it out. I won't Joe back here! -Well, that will be another $300 plus expenses. -It'll be there in half an hour. [PHONE RINGING] -Hello. -I found 'em. LEON (ON PHONE): Great. -You want me to nab him? -No, don't try to grab him. Just watch him. Call me back later and I'll tell ya what to do. They found him. -You mean, they found Joe? -Yeah. -Well, what are you gonna do? -I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make sure Tom goes to jail. Get that crap outta there. -Hi. -I brought some stuff in. -Oh, great. We'll need it. -Got it? -Yeah. It's heavy. -Yeah. This is it, huh? -Yeah. Oh, uh, Nancy Kay, this is my friend, Jay. He's been helping me look after Joe. -Hi. -Hi. So, how is the patient? -Well, he ain't having no good time, but I think he's gonna make it. -Can I see him? -Sure, right in there. -Thanks. -Hi, Joe. -What are you doing here? -Nice to see you, too. -What are you doing here? -How are you feeling? -I feel just like hell. -I brought you some things from the bus. -Well, who asked you do that? -Joe, I'm just trying to help. -Well, everybody's trying to help Joe! -Joe, I wanted to see you. -All right. Then look at me! Look at me! Look at what you book all over the United States! How does he look? Not having a drink for three days, or four days, or has it been a month? Nancy! -Hey, shh! -Nancy! [CRYING] Please help me, Nancy. -Oh, you! Damn you! Damn you! I spent all this time up here with you, trying to get you on your feet, trying to straighten you out. Nearly get myself killed. So if you want to go back to that kind of life, you want to go back to the sewer? Is that what you want to do? Fine. Then you go right ahead. Because I've had it right up to here with you, big brother. And I'll tell you something else. You can take that fat Leon and stick him right up your ass! -Argh! -Ow! Ow! Agh! -You all right, little brother? Ha! Come on. -Ugh! -Oooh! Oh! Oh! -Agh! Ain't like it used to be, is it? You give up? -Agh! -Hey, stop it! Oh, Jay, do something. JAY: I am. I'm watching it. NANCY KAY: Great! -Agh! Come here. [PANTING AND GROANING] -You give up? -Yeah, I'm too old for this. -Would you two mind telling me just exactly what this all about? -He was taken the truck and leaving. -To go get some deodorant. JAY: Deodorant? -Yeah? Deodorant? Oh, deodorant. -Oh, this makes me feel good, Tommy. -Yeah? -You know, the last time we were down in these woods together, we was hunting. You remember that? -Yep. What's that been? Four years? Hm? -More like six to eight. -Has it been that long? You know, that's a sin, Tommy. That's a sin. When brothers don't get together any more often than we do. Hm. [SIGH] And when we do, it has to be under these conditions-- me in the shape I'm in and slapping my little brother's face. I'm sorry about that, Tommy. I really am. I apologize for your big brother's ego. -You don't have to apologize to me about anything, Joe. -Well-- -Besides, I got in a few good licks. I've been waiting a long time for that, too. Hm! -Hey, Tommy, play that hand for me. Oh! JOE: I can take it better from you. -Sure! -She's got three 6's. [WOLF HOWLING] [SCREAMING] -Please, God! Oh, damn it! He-- I told you he's in there! He's the ugliest thing I ever seen. Come on! -OK, Jay. Now, have you been drinking? -Now, you know I don't' drink! Come on! [SIGH] [SIGH] -What did ya find? -Been trying to tell him there wasn't anything out there. -I-- I saw it with my own eyes. It was little. It was green. And it was ugly! [CHUCKLING] -Get the video. -That was a pretty good. I think that one's gonna live now. -Oh, good. -Let's play some poker. -Yeah, but I'm gonna change my shoes. -Better change your pants. -How long you been, uh, working for Joe? -About three years. -You like working for him? -Yeah. He's a sweetheart-- most of the time. It's Leon that's the pain. He works Joe to hard. -I never did like him, even when I was a kid. Never did trust him, either. -Word around the business is that Leon has built himself an empire off of Joe's name. And that Joe is not getting any part of it. -You think he has? -I don't know. But, um, something's going on. Leon hired some sleazy looking accountant and he fired Emma Bigsley. -Miss Emma? -They said she was juggling the books. -No. Not Miss Emma. No. -Oh! -Ha, ha. Hey, how's it going? -Fine. -Ha, ha. Good, I only got two more miles. -Watch my fly. JOE: (SINGING) You brought me love. And you taught me how to care. You showed me heaven, heaven, then you took me there. And now you're such a part of me. I close my eyes and all I see is you forever here with me. You brought me love. TOMMY: Miss Emma, I sure do appreciate you coming along to help us. EMMA: Well, honey, you know it was no trouble at all. Well, it-- it's right up over the door. Ri-- right up there. -Where? Up here? Got it. EMMA: Do you know that Leon said that I had stolen money from Joe? Well, you know I wouldn't to that, now, don't ya? TOMMY: Yes, ma'am. I know that's true. EMMA: Now you know, he keeps those books locked up. I don't know where those keys are. TOMMY: Well, don't worry about that, Miss Emma. I brought something along to take care of that. [CHAIN SAW RUNNING] -Good morning, Mr. Redden. -Morning. Larry. Larry, uh, I got a terrible headache. Give me a-- where's your bag? -I left it right out there. -Well, you idiot! You can't go leaving it laying around like that. What if a cop come up and looked in there? Why, they'd lock you up and bury the key. No go out there. Bring it in here. Leaving that bag laying around like that. I-- uh, like I was saying, girls. Uh, we, uh, are going to do a new album cover and we're looking for some lovely new faces. And, uh-- -You just name your ills, we got the pills. Broke your duck, but do you want a pill anyway? I got some aspirins here. -Larry. -Huh? -What's that lamp doing over there? -Just sitting there on the floor. You want me pick it up? -Please. Put it on the desk where it belongs. Tom! Come on, Larry. You girls sit down and have a drink. Now I want you to go find Malone and tell him to get them papers and bring 'em right back here. -Well, now-- well, now how do you know that Tom's got 'em? I know he's got 'em. Who else would want the damn things? No go on, get in the car! -Hm. Don't know where he's been getting some of these ideas from. Now I'm glad he understands this. Because I know perfectly well that I don't. But I'll drive out there. -Here's another account. -Hey! You're back. -When did y'all get back? What's all the books? -Leon's account files. -What? -What-- what are you-- what did you just say? What-- what is all this? -Leon's account files. -Has it crossed your mind you can get in trouble doing things like this? -Mm, hm. But before you all get bend out of shape, let me ask ya about, uh, this $8 million in a Swiss bank account in Leon's name. Did you know that he owns 70% of your publishing company? Did you also know you gave him Power of Attorney to sign anything, anything at all, and it's legal. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Nobody has my Power of Attorney. And that's not my signature! Look at that. How's business at your restaurant and your record store and all of the other places down by the office? Uh, the one's with your name on 'em? -Well, they do a lot of business. -Yeah. They do a lot of business. They use your name. But Leon owns them, 100%. [SIGH] I'll say one thing for old Leon, boy, he sure kept good bankbooks. Here's an--uh, here's a bank account on the money that you loaned me. -What are you talking about? I never loaned you any money. -And what about the $250,000 to design the engine for the car? -I gave you that money. -And if you gave me that money, I want to know why I paid it back at 12% interest? -$8 million? -Mm, hm. -And he owns all of my songs? Where have I been? Damn his soul. -Now wait a minute. Now we're going to get him. -Oh, you're damn right why we are going to get him, little brother. -All right. Listen to me. Just listen to me. We're gonna get him, but we're gonna do it our way. -Thinking. Right. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Yeah, little brother. Ha, ha, ha. -What-- what's the matter? -So Leon has been stealing from me. Uh, huh. Well, that means I got one coming, don't it, Big 'un? -Yeah. I believe you're right. -I believe I'm right. Come on. -Hey! Just where do you-- And just where in hell do you think you're going? -You ain't going nowhere. JOE: Damn you! -Oh! I can't see! -Get up! LARRY: Joe, I won't do that. Leon will kill me! Go- I won't-- uh-- -You don't want to do it? Big Jay? -I think we ought to convince him. -Wait. -I think you're right. -Wait a minute! I have-- MALONE: Do it! Do whatever they want you to do! Do it! Do what they want! Don't wait! Hurry up and do what he wants! Do what he wants! Ugh! [SPITTING] I kine this was going to be a shitty job. -Pretty good, Big Jay. MALONE: Somebody get me outta here! -Now, uh, Larry, what do you think? -Uh, an-- an-- anything. Uh, uh, anything. Anything you want. [LEON LAUGHING] LEON: Big time fool!

[CHUCKLING] -You-- you think I stole this money? I didn't steal it, Joe. Um, it ain't my money. But it ain't your money. It's-- it's-- it's our money. We-- we're-- we're partners, Joe. -Have a drink, Leon. -Thank you, Joe. -You stole the money, Leon. And you know, as well as I know, you could have had anything that you wanted. See all this?

If you ain't looking up and dreaming, you ain't going very far. 'Cause all you are is one of many who come this way and come to know that the race is on, and if you ain't running, you're never gonna win, place, or show. It's on a wheel, it comes around. What comes around comes around. It's on a wheel that comes around. What comes around comes around! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JOE: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
