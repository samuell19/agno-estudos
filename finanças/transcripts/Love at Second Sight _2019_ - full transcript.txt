Do you have any patterns? - What? Patterns, for my fountain pen. What? - Ink cartridges. Ramisse, let's hear it what you have written down. No please. - Let the whole class enjoy. With an elegant movement Zoltan knows how to floor the mercenary. Once again he unites the sublime with the exceptional. In any case, not autobiographical. Think about it. Continue next time. Raph, Raph ... You are always busy with your book. He is right. This is how you pass your exam. I know that. It's the only thing that interests me. - Then let me read it. Why can't anyone ever read it? - It must be perfect. That has been going on for three years now. Stop it. Does he at least have a nice wife, that Zoltan? It's a superhero, he has 1000. 1000? Then it is worthless. Every superhero has a true love. Otherwise nobody cares. Batman has Catwoman. - That's not his wife. Luke Skywalker has Princess Leia. - That's his sister. Tarzan has Jane. Even Shrek has one. It is green and it stinks. - Shrek is a monster. Yes, Shrek is a monster. - I'm stuck. I don't know how to proceed. - Come on, serve. Over there. It is sitting. Come on, hurry up. Come on, ladies. Young, don't stay put. It's time, hurry up. Who are you? What are you doing over there? I nothing... I came to the music. No one listens and looks at me here. Strange, because it's not bad. No, it's not bad. Only when it is perfect do I perform. Excuse me. What the hell are we doing? - Run. Hurry up. Come. Damn. - That way. Fast. Wait, wait. My heart beats very quickly. - Mine too. Raphaël, pleasant. - Olivia. My head is spinning. I'm going to lie down. I'm not feeling well either. - No? I see asterisks everywhere. That is insane. When you consider that someone passes out 8 to 10 times in his life ... The chance that two people at the same time fainting in the same place ... is one in 2747. Not so crazy. How can I do that writing now lost? No, 8,455,000 and some. - Stop that. That novel was my life. Then why do you register it a notebook? Now you have to rewrite everything. Rewriting everything ... You think that you simply rewrite such a story? Yes. Shut up. - I didn't say anything. There she is. Go away. Leave? All right. See you soon, Raph. Hello, can I sit down? - Of course. Everything good? You're not going to faint again, are you? No, but I have lost my notebook. - Damn... I know that. I am in 2003 lost a pen. That was terrible too. It's more about the story that I wrote in it. It contained good things. That Zoltan was quite sympathetic. Do you have it? - It was still in the attic. Thank you, you saved my life. You saved my life. Damn. Have you really read everything? Now we are even. - Yes, but this was a ... This version was not yet completely finished. It is a draft version. But I wanted to know or Zoltan would make it. Honest? - Yes you are. It is a decorator, he kisses women he hardly knows. Do you think it really works like that? - In real life? No. No, clearly not. I have to leave. Bye. Wait a minute. I thought about what you said. For example, we kiss. That is credible. Yes that is true. But when I read it, I thought more of such a kiss. Okay, I understand that. You were thinking about that. But I have the character finally figured out. I know him well. It's more someone who ... EXAM RESULTS Olivia and Raphaël fell here foolish for each other. Success is a reward or does it mean extra pressure? When I write, I am alone. I forget everything. Then I am the high school student again with a lot of imagination. Thank you. Tomorrow your book will be published worldwide. I am home. How was i Did you not receive my message? - I get that now. You haven't been waiting for me. - No. Cool. I still have to work. Is Felix all right? - Yes fine. He still talks about Morgane. He's still in love. She's been away from him for three years, what a misery. Zoltan and Shadow are in the hands of the Enemy. One of them must die. The enemy decides. It will be... Shadow collapses. Zoltan must ... only to save humanity. End Are you at the end? - From what? Why don't you let me read it? - I do not know. Do you want to read it? I always do that, right? Then you have to read it. Tell me what you think. Don't you want me to read it anymore? Shall we not argue tonight? Please, I'm tired. I have a tough day tomorrow, with students. And I have to talk about the movie version. But wasn't that certain? - Yes, that goes on. Nice to hear that. Let's celebrate with a nice rotten evening. Why are you nagging like this? You nag. You tell me nothing more. I have to eat on my own. Where are you? Things are not going well between us anymore. After all my sacrifices ... - Stop talking about your sacrifices. You are not unhappy. I am unhappy. You see that, right? You will see that we grow apart. That you ignore me all day. That cannot continue like this. I had imagined life differently. I can give up things ... but I never thought that you would become such a bag. Don't you love me anymore? I do not know. Zoltan The last trip It is over. Shadow collapses on the frozen ground. Eight o'clock. The news with Virginie Bruant. A terrible snowstorm about Paris last night. Olivia ... Watch out, stoop. It's Christmas. Crazy. You look chic. - What is that? Where is the Audi? - Very nice, the limo is in the garage. Are we going on that thing? - Don't say that, we'll have a breakdown. Look, footrests. That is better. Yummy? Your tail bone is between my balls. Here we go. I have a migraine, don't you have anything? - No, I have nothing. But why are you dressed so fancy? Did you go out last night? I went for a drink. - You should have called me. What a sad affair. Hello Hello. - Everything good? Raph ... Hey. - Bye, thanks. Unbelieveable. - What can you ignore her? Why does she call me Raph? She has the same perfume as Morgane. Stop it. Smell is such a strong memory. I have that again and again. Goodbye, Mr. Ramisse. - See you later. Wait, wait. Are you not coming with me? To do something? Do I have to do everything alone? Don't I get a cup of coffee? What kind of receipt is this? What an arrogance. Roll out the red carpet for Mr. Ramisse. See you later. Children, sit down. Michel, please. Hey. Thank you. Shall I just sit there? All right. Pleasant. What are we doing? Are we waiting for the journalists? Or are we just starting? Then we'll see. Excuse me, just put your phone away. All of that will soon be possible. We make selfies afterwards. I'm here now, so take advantage of it. We do a classic question and answer. You ask me questions about the book. Then I answer. Who's starting Miss. I found on the internet ... that the comma in Hamlets' to be or not to be 'has changed location. First he stood after 'to be or not' ... Then a comma and then: "To be, that's the question." What? - That changes everything. That is no longer a hymn of life. Because you had it last time about death in that text. Last time? You also asked why Shakespeare so ended. Yes. But... I'm not Shakespeare. I don't know anything about that comma ... All right. - I am sorry but... I'm not here for that. You... Question about Zoltan the mercenaries, Shadow ... About whom? - Shadow. The heroine. Are you kidding me? Are you okay? I already understood. A joke. Hidden camera. Where's the camera? Okay, behind the mirror. The classic mirror trick. Joehoe ... I hope you enjoyed it. I understand you, but I don't feel like it today. Better next time. Arrange it with the production. I'm going to my publisher. Felix, are you certainly in the conspiracy? I'll see you outside. We have an appointment. You were really great. You there... That whole story about "Hamlet." You become a star. All right. Ciao, kids. Hello, Nina. Hey, Charles. I have sent you the latest version. Where are you going, sir? I'm a little early. Did we not have an appointment at 11 am? - No. Doesn't matter, sit down. Please continue. We want an adjustment that is more focused on emotion. The story about those Moldovan soldiers is universal. Where's Felix? - That's the movie we want to make. And Matt Damon thinks the book is beautiful. Excuse me ... Sorry, I'm interrupting you. I do not get it. What is it? - Matt Damon is super, I love him. But where does Zoltan fit? Zoltan? You mentioned Moldovan prisoners of war ... What kind of nonsense is that? - What are you talking about? Oh no? Do you also participate? Is there a camera team somewhere here? Who is this? - Someone of yours. No, does he not belong to you? - I do not know him. Who is this then? - Enough, Etienne. We have laughed. That's it. Go away, I don't know you. Marie ... What a nightmare. What is going on? Can you take this joker with you? - Stop it now. I'm losing my temper. - Okay, then go away. Sorry, I don't know him. Matt Damon, really? - Do not you know me? How do I know where you live? That you have three children? That you had a crop? How do I know that? And that you every Wednesday your secretary sew at Hotel Mercure? Sorry, Marie. - What did you say? He fucks his secretary at the Mercure hotel. Every Wednesday. Every ... Potting up. Have a nice day. What is this? Just be patient, she will be coming soon. I know that, but we've been waiting a long time. What are you waiting for? - At Olivia Marigny. That's my wife. - Very witty. Look. This was in Bordeaux, in 2015. Then I still had a beard, but it made me fat. Look, with a heart. Do you know what it cost? Five euro. I have the security five euros. I'm her biggest fan. I know everything about her, what she does all day. Last night she was on the news. Now she's coming to the Odeon. Watch out, you make donkey ears. She always dreamed of it to act here. She's free tomorrow, but at nine o'clock she must go to a gala for sick children. So if she was your wife then I would know that. Olivia, Olivia ... Olivia, you okay? We have waited a long time for you. Thank you. Thank you very kindly. Do you want a photo? What is your first name? Raphael. With a trema on the E? - Yes. Please. Have a nice day. See you soon. Olivia ... What is this all about? What a mess. What is this, a dating site? Profession: literature teacher Who are those people? And now our guest for tonight. Good evening, Olivia Marigny. The tickets for your concert are sold out in less than an hour. The most famous classical pianist ... is now a pop star. - No no. My audience is very young. Yo, Raph, how are you? Why didn't you teach today? - I didn't feel well. Yesterday's caught me well. I must have said the craziest things. - Never go out without me again. Tell me how it was Given your headline this morning it was tough. Damn... - Who were there? Did you still fuck? Tell. Do you still remember Marbella? Do you want to know the details? Of course, everything. We fucked a lot there. Do you remember that surf teacher, Cristina? I miss that time. Why do you ask that? And that evening with that mysterious one Mexican ... Moment. What was our motto again? - Wait a second. Hello bunny, are you okay? It's seven o'clock, I'm late. There was no more lasagna, but still bo bun. Do you like that, bo bun? - Yes. I can not anymore, 3B has worn me out. If they are not insufferable, they know nothing. It is disastrous. And then that little Miguel. I can do it hit it, with that mustache of him. He is unintelligible. Are you not coming? Yes, I am on my way. I can not anymore. Come. - Yes here. Are you OK? I am happy to see you. Me you too. If you are broken, it is possible another time. Yes, you are broken. No. - Yes. Do you know what would be nice? If you massage me again, like last time. I am in a lot of pain. Like last? - Yes, I can no longer. No, my feet. - Of course, your feet. Thank you. - You're welcome. We are discreet at school, but you can greet me. This morning. That was a game. That excited me. - Oh no? That was not the intention. - Yes, you wanted to excite me. So that I would like to have you. - That wasn't ... What are you doing? Wait. No no. I'll be right back. Is everything really going well? - No actually not. I ate something wrong. I am going to take a quick shower. Maybe not waiting for me. If you want to leave, you can. - I'm going to eat something, I'm beating. Oh no? She stays. Damn, there is soy in my bo bun. I said so. I can't believe that. What is that? What kind of nonsense is that? Damn... Ping? The other one has Pong. Ping-Pong, what an idiots. It was crazy. She jumps you. Then you suddenly disappear. She starts eating first. Then she undresses, without her knowing that I'm watching. I keep watching. She completely undresses. So I stop looking. You know me. I watched for two minutes at most. Nice tits. Very nice tits. But you are in love with her? No, it's just a girl. - Respect. You know me. Yes, I know you. - What's the matter with you? What is it? Nothing, there is nothing. - You act weird since yesterday. Did something happen? You're gonna think I'm crazy. - No, tell me. Don't you trust me anymore? Raph ... Since yesterday morning I have been in a parallel universe, my whole life has changed. You are an idiot. Come on, seriously. Since yesterday morning ... I am in a parallel universe. My whole life has changed. I told you so? - Do not mess with me. It is hell. I swear. I was married, writer, I had a big flat. I came on TV, I had a wonderful life. - Married? She has not recognized me since yesterday. She was a piano teacher, now she is a concert pianist. I have been a teacher since yesterday. I want my old life back. If I landed here can I leave here again. Very funny ... Stop it with that nonsense, you stand here for 3B. See you later. Mrs. X meets Mr. Y. 10 years later Mr. Y is sitting suddenly in a time slot ... where Mrs. X him 10 years before. She has finished another timeline. Do you understand? - Yes, you are the X. No, I am Mr. Y. - Y. Who is that? - Open up. Think about it. Hello how are you? I have a cheesy easy for you, a merguez biggy burger ... and two vache qui ride. - We didn't order anything. Are you crazy? Ho, Ho ... Never mind, Sandra. He's joking. Happy. Bye. - Until next time. Are you crazy or something? You can still have respect for us Happy Hour? Like you talk to her ... - I do not get it. Have you even forgotten Sandra? - Do I know that girl? Sandra? I think you have it known once or 10 times. And really well known. Maybe you already have Alzheimer's. Do you realize how much I have to learn again? Felix, you have to help me. Suppose I had a concussion. Then you have a memory loss. Then summarize for me my life. Your name is Raphaël Ramisse, my dear friend. You are a literature teacher. Your students think you are the best teacher. I don't necessarily think so. We're table tennis, pretty good. You never want to live together, because you want fucking your girls in your boy's room. That is it by and large. - Felix ... I'm not that. - True. That is not my life. I am in a parallel universe. Is that scientifically possible? Scientifically, it is madness. - That's it too. Madness, Madness. It is... - Madness. That also explains why you are now don't buy me chocolate cookies. That is the formal proof. That I am someone else. That's not for me, give away chocolate buns. And you are married? What is her name? - Olivia. She didn't recognize me, I received a signature. A signature? That's very kind. - Do I have to talk to her? If my whole life has changed, and hers too ... are they connected. - Invite your imagined wife. Where is she tonight? I know that. You'll never come there without invitation inside. No worries. I'll take me inside. Good evening. - Move aside, sir. Is there... - There is a guest list. Of course... - And I don't know you. Get out. Very handy. Come on, Raph. That's in the back. Can you hold this for a moment? I am in. No Olivia for sure? - No, I don't see her. She would certainly be here. - I can't laugh about it anymore, Raph. Maybe you get demented, come back. - I see her. Is very? Really? - Yes. Yes, she is standing in front of me. What am I doing now? Try to catch her gaze. You're right. She doesn't look and talk to other people. - Look at her heart. When I first saw Morgane, she felt it like an arrow through her heart. That does not work. It works a bit. She watches. - See? The arrow. She comes to me. How far is she still gone? - Shut up. Excuse me? - Don't shut up, good evening. Are there any of those mini dishes? What kind of mini dishes? - Those glasses. Those little pots, I don't know. - Yes. Yes, those little pots. With eggplant St-Jacques? - Indeed. I like that, because I'm a waiter. Here, from just now. Thank you. I thought you forgot about me. - Not me. Raphaël? - Yes. I thought I was dying. - With a trema on the E? Yes Yes. You were at the Odeon yesterday. I'm good at first names. Are you there, Olivia? Do you come? Everyone is looking for you. Sorry. - I'm coming. I have to go. Thank you for this. Speaking of that ... Can I be honest with you? I'm not a waiter. - Are you not? You should have said that. - No, it's my fault. But it doesn't matter because now I have spoken to you. That was cool. - Olivia ... They become impatient. - I am coming. Have a nice evening. - Yes, me too. Hurry up. - Is this really mandatory? Nicolas Massart, that's good. - This is not gonna work. I haven't played in a long time. - And Vincent Ricoux. Come. We alternate the service. I let myself down no longer store in the second set. Hello, Raph ... Are you okay? - Yes with you? Great, will I see you later? She also? - Elisa? Yes, regularly. Crazy. - Like an atomic bomb. Here's your bat. I did two blue firesop. We put them in. Wait, wait ... The river snake attack. - I do not know what that is. Service... I said river snake. - I do not know that one. Service... Not bad. I hit him. It is not over yet. I'm sorry, but I warned you. You would never play that bad. Proof that your story is correct. Do you believe me? - I do not know. Are you turning now? I know your cock. How do you mean? - We've been playing together for 10 years. It's not my best friend, but i know your cock. Sorry, but I don't know yours. - And I haven't played table tennis for 10 years. If you are your old partner and his cock want to return, you have to help me. Please. Einstein has already talked about it. With the special theory of relativity interdimensional movements possible. Okay, so you can? - Yes No. I do not know. It intrigues me. I studied on parallel universes and time travel. You have Schrödinger's cat, black and green holes. The string theory, with super strings. - I don't understand that. Have you seen 'Les Visiteurs'? With Godefroy de Montmirail. The count of Apremont and Papincourt. - Hubert's cousin. Jean Réno. What you have is called uchronie. Godefroy kills Frénégonde's father, with a crossbow. He thought he was a bear, poisoned by a witch. They get lost in time because a druid forgot the quail eggs. That's why they go back in time to undo that. Are you telling the whole movie now? What does that have to do with me? The agreement is the domino effect. Something has set this in motion. That's why I'm in this life now and i need ping pong. There is usually a conflict that initiates the transition. An accident, a break ... Something violent. - I already know. I was just arguing with my wife. - Provide all details. Be precise. - I came home the day before yesterday. What time? - I do not know. I need to know that. - 10 hours. I came home for 10 hours. We never have a fight otherwise. Then we had a huge fight. - Huge. She didn't know if she still loved me. - Not anymore? I know that. I broke a lamp and am angry walked away with slamming doors. Then the snowstorm came. - Oh yes, that storm. I had never seen anything like it. - That must be it. Olivia must live in this fall in love with me again. That is your crossbow. If you have recaptured your own wife ... With Morgane I can't do that. You are kidding me. That is very easy. I know everything about her, what she likes. What is her favorite number? - "Le temps de l'amour", Françoise Hardy. Mine too. - Something else. Pepitos, she hates that. She likes mini-madeleines in a green bag. With coconut flavor? - What else do I know? She drinks ristretto coffee, black without sugar. She loves Woody Allen and forget-me-nots. She always wants to swim when she sees the sea, even if it is ice cold. She vibrates when she is nervous. She always changes at the last minute believe. That drives me crazy. She picks up the duvet, and wraps itself in it. She loves making love in the shower. If she suddenly kisses me in the neck ... after a fight, that means she forgives me. They... I know everything about a woman that may no longer exist. Yes, you should not panic. You have to talk to her first. Does she have no family, friends? Hello, I am Raphaël. A friend from Olivia. Will she come to you on Sunday afternoon usually not visit? Nice to see you again. That is a long time ago. How is it going? Do you recognize me? I don't have a good memory, but I remember important people. You still wear your engagement ring. It's for Olivia, on the day she gets married. Yes, I mean ... Good that she takes the time for that. Are you still playing? - Of course every day. The piano is my family. What are you currently reading? - Biographies. I like to know the secrets from the lives of people. May I? - Of course. Unique... - Hello, Gabbs. What are you doing here? - And you? You don't want to say that Gabrielle is your grandmother? Yes. - That's insane. What are you doing here? Family only and staff may come here. I am the cultural employee from the center. I come every week. Then we read something or listen to music. Your grandmother is one of my favorites. Gabbs, is that so? Do you know him? I will leave you alone. Hey? Can I have the director? What are you doing, Olivia? Are you coming for a phone call or are you coming for me? Come on, we'll play. What did you call me? - Olivia. I have not forgotten your first name. Don't forget, no. Do you really know that boy from just now? Yes, I like it very much. Forward. The right cable car ... Bye, Olivia. Fancy a coffee? See you soon, Yves. A nice coffee ... Bah, no. That is disgusting. I only drink ristretto, black without sugar. You not? - No, I'm not that hard. With coffee? - No. Have you been working here for a long time? Yes, a few years already. It is voluntary work, in my spare time. People who forget everything that moves me. Mini-madeleines, with coconut flavor? No, thank you. - Yes, no? This is the green bag with coconut flavor. No not at all. Thank you. OK. Sorry. I'm sorry, I have to leave. Gabrielle was doing well. - She called me by my first name. That is a long time ago. I found her beautiful, enthusiastic. She is still playing the piano. She reads a lot. That is beautiful at her age. Biographies of others, because she can't finish her own. I didn't know she wrote her memoir. Have you already started yours? To my memoirs? - Your biography. No not at all. You are a great pianist, granddaughter of a pianist. You can tell about that. - That's not very interesting. The readers like little secrets. And I can help you, it's my job. If I do not read voluntarily or waiter play. I let you think about it. Then we are still talking about it. Honestly ... I don't think so. Have a nice day. - You too. Thanks for the coffee. Are you the agent of Olivia Marigny? I... You introduce yourself. - I am... Say something. Arnaud de Saint-Georges de Mont-Sainclar. Have you gone mad? Fortunately we practice first, this is terrible. I thought it was going well. - You are not a marquis, you are my agent. You say hello, I am ... - Hello I'm... I am... - You distract me, I am Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre? - Pierre. Jean-Pierre Pierre? Three first names? - That's my name. Jean and then Pierre. That's unbelievable. Everyone then hears Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre Lepecheur. Which is good. Listen: I am the agent of Raphaël Ramisse, Jean-Pierre Lepecheur. Okay, go ahead. It works out fine. - No, we rehearse until the end. You don't trust me, just do it yourself. - I trust you. Keep it simple. Can you manage that? - All right. Simple. - Okay, call me. He is passing. Bye, with Jean-Pierre Lepecheur - What kind of voice is that? No, his assistant. I will put you through. With Jean-Pierre Lepecheur. - Normal voice. With Jean-Pierre Lepecheur. I give it to you. Yes hello? Is that over now? It's a little bit chaos here in the office. Can you understand me? With Jean-Pierre Lepecheur. I'm Raphaël Ramisse's agent. He recently met Olivia Marigny. She is the next artist about whom he wants to write. That's a whole project, isn't it? Yes Yes... What are you doing? - My pipe. Yes of course. Yes, biographies are his specialty. Sorry, I farted. Bah... - Yes, he's enthusiastic. He lives, sleeps and eats biographies. Keep it simple. - He likes it. I do not care. I can send that to you immediately. At the nearest collection point? Also not? Not at all? - Give up here, you totally ruined it. He thinks I'm great. Damn. Sorry. - It does not matter. You have to have dinner with her on Saturday evening. - What? I'm a genius. You go eat with her on Saturday. It is not certain, you have to convince her. But if you're good, you're good. Are we still doing that? Yes, we still do that. Good evening. - Good evening. Please for you. Did you know that that my favorite flowers are? I can't believe it, forget me nots? A happy coincidence. Marc, are you coming? - Excuse me, I didn't hear you. Marc? - Marc Deschanel, nice. Nice to meet you, Raphaël. With a trema on the ... - I spoke to your agent. You are her agent. - Agent, producer, manager ... and almost my husband. I have every confidence in that. Sorry. - What is it? No, I had ... I thought you were gonna spill wine on that beautiful floor. I wanted to prevent that. All right. Are we waiting for your agent? - My agent? Why? We did anyway agreed with the four of us? Yes, he is coming soon. Yes? - This is unbelievable. Why are you whispering? - I'm in the bathroom. Are you going to jump her like that? No, stop it. Why do you whisper too? - No idea. Felix, you have to help me. Olivia has a friend. Her driver, impresario, tax specialist ... - Three men? Is she a nymphomaniac? - No, her husband is all three. You called him. Then I said you would come too. So we are waiting for you. I put on a pastel sweater and come on. What do you wear? I thought I was already with the neighbors. This house looks like a village. Good evening. - Jean-Pierre Lepecheur. Pleasant. - Olivia. Jean-Pierre is my ... - Hello Darling. My agent. - Sorry I'm late. All those files. I can't reach Marie-Jo. Marie-José Pérec. I've been trying for a week make a lunch appointment But that does not matter. I made ravioli, it's ready. We can sit at the table. - Great. Why are you kissing me on my mouth? - Women love unreachable men. And I can't play a woman. - Are you crazy? I also have a pipe with me. - Stop it anyway. Trust in the talent of Mont-Sainclar. - Not Lepecheur? Trust the talent of Lepecheur. It's delicious. My specialty is skate with beurre blanc. But I read your Wikipedia page. - Wiki ... I read that your parents were active in Cuba in the protection of rays. Hence the ravioli. I would have liked to have tasted your ray. Ravioli is a bit difficult for me. Are you allergic? - No, but when my ex left me ... Jean-Pierre, never mind ... Then I have eaten ravioli for three weeks. When I see ravioli, I think of us and then I have to surrender. A nice anecdote. - If I had known that ... That's why I don't say it. I'm not hungry anymore. Shall we talk about the biography? - Yes. You were not very enthusiastic. - I do. Olivia was somewhat reserved. - A little bit yes. It is very good for your image. Your fans deserve it to know more about you. Especially considering what you have already done: David Bowie, Bocuse, Zidane ... Not crazy. Yes indeed. You will not find it annoying that your name is not mentioned anywhere? Yes, that's a good question. - What shall I say? I'm used to paying attention always goes to another. He disappears behind the people which he describes. That doesn't mean anything. - In a way. Did you make the food alone? Or the two of you? - No, I'm the boss in the kitchen. She obeys. Otherwise she would eat anything. - What? When I ever left her, she went to a terrible pizzeria. No, I went to dinner with the first violinist. You couldn't stand that, you were jealous. Jealousy is very bad. - But it was a filthy pizzeria. What? This is a sturdy table. Willow wood? No, there is dessert. I'm going with you. I am interested in your magic recipe. See you soon. Are you going to get some fresh air? - Yes. He can't see me smoking. No? He hates it when I smoke and I hate it when he says that. I get it. Have you been together for a long time? Yes, we are already working ... - No, I meant together, together. As a couple? No, that's ... We are not a couple. It seemed that way. He's just my agent. I'm very straight. You certainly did not want to work together, because you are homophobic. No, but I don't know what I am for would have interesting things to say. I think it would be exciting. If your hands are insured, are you not allowed to cook, garden ... or motorcycling and even about a manicure you must consult with your manager. Then your life will be much less exciting. In the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening I play the piano. Yes, you often play the piano. A biography about someone who can only play the piano ... can also be fun. We are just starting. If you are after it 10 years, we will stop. I have nothing against you ... but I find myself too young. It would be pretentious. All right. I do not push further, subject closed. Really? - Promised. The dessert is ready, are you coming? Yes, we are coming. He just won't stop. We love each other. - Jean-Pierre, come and have a look. Thanks. They are waiting for us. - Yes. I am... You will find it crazy ... but I have changed my mind. It is good to try something new. If it doesn't work after 10 years, we will stop. Good? - All right. Super, as you want. Okay, there we go. Where shall I begin? I've read that you were born in the Perigord? Yes. What is your best memory? at the piano? My best memory? One of my first videos. It was quite kitsch. There was a piano at the edge of the forest. I was rehearsing and suddenly I see a brown bear. No... - I panicked. But he guided me on a tree trunk. - What? The craziest thing was that he knew the ninth of Beethoven. That's a shame, we almost had it already a whole chapter. That's too bad. - But seriously ... My best memory was with my grandmother in the Camargue. I was about four years old, I was busy on a key and burst out laughing. That's cute. - Yes. That's cute too. I am satisfied, a good first session. - Yes? Raph ... That's incredible. Oh no? - Who is that? An ex I can't get rid of. What are you doing here? - I followed you. Olivia, this is Mag ... Melanie, sorry. This is Olivia. Who is that? - Pleasant. Shut up. No, Melanie. We are not going to start like this. We just say things to each other. I'm in love. - Oh? I thought so. - I didn't know how to say it. We never talk. - And how long has it been? That is... - It's very recent. It is quite recent ... But it is developing well. - I'm leaving you, Raph. Yes. - Why yes? I said yes, but not as in yes, yes. It is that other yes. I understand you're leaving me. I would like you so beating up. But when I see you like this ... You are a beautiful couple. A kind of osmosis, a fusion between two hearts. I am disappointed. I'm sorry, duckling. - Bunny, jerk. Yes, my bunny. Sorry. Sorry. Thanks. - That's okay. Were you together for a long time? - We know each other from school. So that has been a long time. - No, from the school building. I sometimes teach there. That was a long time ago for me, another life. A different life, indeed. Jacques Decour lyceum, from 2005 to 2008. - It must be. But I'm talking about me. We sat at the same time at the same school. No... - I can't believe it. I'm sorry, but I don't remember you. No, that's ... - I was a little wild at the time. But funny that we might meet each other Have met 10 years ago. Yes, funny. Why did you necessarily want to go in here? - What a worthless padlock. Never mind, you are still hurt. - No, I will not let it go. I will not be stopped through such a padlock. I knock it off. That is going to work. Are you OK? What is this here? Forward. What are you doing? - You can get out of there. If you force the door there, you can go through the window. It is open there. - Yes you are. My heart beats very quickly. As if you pass out. - No, I'm more out of breath. Out of breath, out of consciousness. We have to sit down. It starts with breathlessness, but then... There is a wanderer. It's better already. - Sure? I always had little faints. Then I will be completely ... But it goes well. - You have to stick with it. Sorry. We would work but end up here. That's an idiot. - Don't worry, we'll work next time. And we still remember. Yes, we still remember. Here I won my first prize and Marc met. That has changed my life. - I can imagine. Same time tomorrow? - I can not tomorrow. I'm going to the Camargue for a few days. But after the weekend? - Okay, that's fine. You would find it absurd if I went with you? Yes, a little bit. Yes, that is very unusual. But it wouldn't be bad for the book. See how you work there. - I always go there alone. I fully understand that. What does he think, that intruder ... Have a nice weekend then. - Nice weekend. Unfortunately. If you change your mind ... No no. I've changed my mind. I didn't want to leave you alone. Yes, damn it. Raphael. Sorry, I'm late. - Does not matter. I have mini madeleines for you. Are these not good? Green bag, coconut flavor. Yes, but we suddenly tutor each other. Do you think that is annoying? - No, that's easier. OK, cool. We go? - Yes. Do you come? This is where I live. I have a surprise. Are you coming? What? - Come on. Do you like cycling? What? Raphaël, cycling? Do you think that's a good idea? - Yes of course. Are you OK? - Yes, only ... The gear is stuck. That's how he does it. Look, flamingos. That was once my nickname. - Flamingo? Yes, because I used to be alone until my knees went into the sea. Hence flamingo. - You see? That is something for a biography. Do you come? - I never told you. Wait... Nothing wrong. Not bad. It's pretty bad. Do you want to play? - If you want. I can not do it. - You'll see it. Give me your hands. I'm ruining everything. - No. It was very nice. - Yes. I'm not in your support, but ... That is not possible. We have to stop. This way we don't get home safely. We drank 2 or 3 glasses. - Two or three glasses? Bottles, you mean. I always had to be wise. Have you never failed? - Not really no. I drank a lot at school. - Oh yeah? Fortunately I didn't know you then. Otherwise I would have been an alcoholic now. - No. May I confess to you? - Yes. You'll think it's crazy ... And you probably don't believe it. We know each other very well. - We are starting to get to know each other. We have known each other for years. We were together, a couple. You and me. We loved each other, we are married. That's why I know everything about you. I know it sounds incredible ... but I swear it's true. I can't pretend anymore. Ingenious, imagine something like that. Ridiculous, have you been my husband all this time? Imagine. - What would that have been like? What? - Then tell. We would immediately fall in love have been. We would have shared everything. In the the start would have been great. But at a certain moment I'd forget to look at you. Is that all? Your story is not very inspiring. Can I improvise? - All right. If we meet Had met 10 years ago ... First I wouldn't see you at all. Not at all. But at a certain moment ... I admit, for lack of better. - That's even worse than my story. Okay, I'll start again. It would have started with a crush on school. Agree? - I prefer that. But I mean that that we were in love. The way it only happens to you once. Clammy hands, palpitations, you don't hear anyone anymore ... We leave together. Sexually it is the complete fusion. Everyone is jealous of us. We become the ideal couple. I'm going to play the piano, you write success novels. And we are in the magazines with our dog. With our dog? - A king charles spaniel. A sweetheart. But after four years he dies, Miskin. Miskin. - That's his name. Oh, that's his name. You have to say that. Because I am losing the thread. We travel a lot and have many children. Berlioz, Franz and the smallest Gabrielle. Do I have anything to say about the names? - No nothing. I will. - But after 10 years ... you cheat on me with such a slut from a groupie. No no. - Don't deny it. I found a message and lipstick on your slip. I don't wear slips. - Yes, I swear. You say that gives more support. That is right. - I'm going to live with a friend. You confess guilt. I forgive you, because we love each other a lot. We become more mature, we are going to live by the sea. And we live happily ever after. Long and happy. We could have been happy. Maybe yes. - All right. Shall we go? I want to show you a place. Beware. - It goes well. Do you know what is my favorite number? No idea. 'Le temps de l'amour' by Françoise Hardy. Do you know that? - No. Love time, the time of friends and from the adventure when that time comes and goes you think of nothing despite everything that hurts for the time of love is long and short and always lasts Shall we swim? - No. Yes, we are going to swim. I won. Olivia? Olivia? Olivia? Olivia? I won. I was frightened to death. - Flamingo ... You never have your head under water. It worked. Olivia, Olivia ... It worked. Honey ... It worked. No no no... That's not possible, damn it. Damn. Stay with her for a moment. I make sure I have the next train. I'll call you later, kiss. It was kind of weird last night. We have to keep that under ourselves. What are you talking about? Thank you. I think I'm taking a taxi. I take the bus or the metro. It's there. And? - Total failure. Has she fallen in love again? - Yes. Yes, but it didn't work. Great, you passed? I'm still here, nothing has changed. True. You have your wife back. Why do you want to leave? Because this is not my life. All of this does not exist for me. It was all for nothing. Your theory was wrong. I'm fucking stuck here. I have to teach at a school and that stupid ping-pong every week. Are you serious? - 100 percent. That pleases me. That is heart warming. You are a nice jerk. Leave it alone. - No, Raph. You say it all doesn't exist? But Olivia exists. And I exist. And your life is here for now. You better accept that. Do you see this? I've been dreaming of one thing for years. That my great love loves me again. I've been writing to her every month for three years. Stupid right? Morgane? Why didn't you send them? - Because she asked me to leave her alone. Meet that is my last proof of love. Do you not know how lucky you are with her? Enjoy that. Make sure you are gone when I return. Within. Finally. You disappear and pops up whenever you want. I heard you fell. I just wanted to see how it went. A little dizzy, it was nothing. Sit down. If only I go to the concert from my granddaughter. I have a reserved seat. You are lucky. - Let's not talk about me. Tell me, how did she do? - What? This weekend, you were gone together, right? It was... awesome. Did she say yes? Yes what? - You didn't expect an answer from her? No, I don't believe that. What have I done with that ring? I believe I gave it away. What? - I gave it to someone else. Have you given away your ring? I do not know anymore. I would like that. - The bill please. Don't you assume? - No, I'll call you back later. Leave a message after the beep. Olivia, with me, with Raphaël. I have to talk to you, I have to see you. Come to the high school, to the bench. What's the matter, isn't it? - Yes. Just a little nervous. As if you already know. - What? Do you want to become my wife? Right now? - For the theater, that's a nice symbol. I've talked about it so many times, you never wanted. This seemed the best moment for me. After the concert. It will be an important moment for you. I have tickets to the Seychelles, for the day after. We get married on the beach, only you and me. What do you think? We can Gabrielle don't leave it alone for a month. We have to think about ourselves. Are you OK? - Yes. I thought you wouldn't come. Did you say yes? How so? I went to see your grandmother. Did you say yes? Sorry, Marc has been with me for a long time. Too bad I have you have not met before. Morgane? Good day, sit down. I thought the end of the book was worthless. The heroine is dying. That is strong. - I tend to disagree. He makes you love her, and then he finishes her. The writer is like God. He does what he wants. He decides whether you will arrive in a carriage or in a Ferrari. He wanted her to die, that's why he killed her. Shakespeare did not end well. That's why he just finished her. I think Shakespeare is just a jerk. - That is it. You are right, he is a jerk. Felix, with me. I found my crossbow. I know how it came about I just killed my wife. I didn't understand at first, but now i have it. Call me back or come to tomorrow the Odeon to say goodbye. It is crazy, but I killed my wife. END Is it that good? - Awesome. With that dress there, great. - Thank you. There is a Raphael below. I don't know why I came. - It won't take long. I'm listening. - Well now... I wrote this. You should read this. We would postpone the biography, right? - This is not your biography, but a novel. Even more than a novel. It is hard to explain, but believe me. Read it, please. That is the last thing I ask of you. - Really? Promised. Here, thank you. If you want to attend the concert, can you take my grandmother's place? Isn't she coming? She hasn't been coming for years. I have to go. - Of course. Bye. Raph ... I am happy to see you. - Thanks for the letters. You're welcome. You're a jerk, but one that I like. By the way, I said nice jerk. Do not worry. You were right. Thank you. You will find the other Raph again. I leave. That is also true, I was shocked. Did you kill your wife? What? - I didn't kill my wife. The character, in a book. But now I have rewritten it and I die myself. Olivia only has to read it. To my unknown ... It is really true, the students said ... It works, it's snowing. Yeah so? - She's reading it. The snowstorm, crazy. Okay, I'll miss you, little brother. I will miss you too. Be kind to me there. Take chocolate cakes with you. Where are you going, Raph? Nowhere, goodbye. - Goodbye? The other is coming back. - Which other? I'll explain that to you. - Yes, of course, the other one. See you tomorrow. Then we can eating with three. With the other one. All right? - All right. See you tomorrow. OK, enough. I'm going. Will we be three or four tomorrow? - It doesn't matter, I'll explain it to you. At least I will try. It's an idiot. I love you. I love you. You have to get up in fifteen minutes. Good evening. Row four. - Thank you. Yes, we have a ticket for you. On your name. What is he doing there? - Excuse me? To love you was the most/Nbeautiful thing that happened to me.
