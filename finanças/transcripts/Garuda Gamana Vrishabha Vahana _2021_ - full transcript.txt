I had never expected my life would turn out like this. Everything was going well. A good husband, two beautiful children. But tobacco ruined everything. The cancer which is spreading has to be cut off from my face and taken. Nothing would be the same henceforth. Tobacco has ruined my life. Khaini, Gutka, Tobacco, Zarda Pan masala. Will ruin your life. At times we think what could be the result of smoking cigarettes. As a result of this if I get a stroke will I become a burden to my family? Will I get lung cancer. Can cigarette cause mouth cancer. Can it cause heart disease or emphysema? Next time when you smoke bidi or cigarette, ask yourself what could be the result of smoking. Quit smoking today.

We just dropped in. Sit down. It's departments vehicle. It was lying empty near that Manjalpathe road. I looked around but didn't find anyone. It is departments vehicle, right? To hand it over to the department itself, we came. Where is your SI is not to be seen? Birthday? Remember the place we got the vehicle, right? Near Manjalpathe. What is it? Do you know? Hello! Yes, it's Brahmayya. Ah. I got the transfer to Mangalore, Pandeshwara station. Guards! When they said the vehicle was found near Manjalpathe, it was known where, what has to be searched for. Search! The whole Pandeshwara station had run to Manjalpathe. Taking an ambulance along with them. Search! Sir! Sir, sir, come here. Sir! SI wasn't dead. They hadn't killed him. They means those two. Hari and Shiva. To save one the other one. In other place, if anyone touches the department's person, in half an hour the department would track them down. If not even before that they would have left the place. But here Hari was taking bath in Kadari to cleanse himself the very next morning. Any crime he does to cleanse himself he would come to Kadari. The other one will play cricket with children. You're hitting the air, watch the ball. You played so well. I will play, you go. - I will play. I will win and come. - I know how you will win. Should you go always in everything. - I know what to do, you move. He comes in between everything, my fate. As if he is some big deal. Throw the ball, throw the ball. We must take the runs. If you ask where is this Hari from, everyone knows. He is from Mangaladevi. If asked where is this Shiva from, not an answer but a story will come instead. Who is he, from where he came it's all a story. A strange story. Pour some water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. The boy survived. That boy was of strange behavior. Any girls or women go near him he used to scream like he is about to die. Everyone started to build a story behind it. He was with his mother. She had a connection with some lorry driver. To elope with that person, she threw him and went. That's why he started to fear women. Stories per head. Being in hospital for 23 days, he came out. Went somewhere and wore a ladies slipper and roamed around the whole of Mangalore. From here to bottom nothing has happened it seems. But from here to top, can't even look at it. What? A woman's dead body from Railwaypette. When asked they said, she was hit by train. Will the train go over only the head? No? It has gone it seems. They don't seem to be from this place, they had bags in hand. What are you doing here? What are you doing? Lift up your head and see. Don't you have name? What's your name? Come home. If I again see you like this roaming around in streets, I will break your legs. Go and bring him. What's your name? Shiva. Hey come, come and play with us. Come Putta, can't you hear? Come bro, can't you hear me talking? Throw the ball, let me teach him to play. Do you know how it is played? I will throw the ball at you. When I throw, you must run. If you don't run, I will throw again and again. Throw, throw. Give the ball, give the ball. You will be beaten again. Throw, throw, throw again. - Pick up the ball. Give the ball, give the ball. Throw again. Throw faster. All possible people tortured him. He didn't react for anyone. No need Vasu, why? - Give it, just do as I say. What's your name? He told around ten times, it's Shiva. This beggar doesn't have mouth to speak? Who knows. - You light, light it. No need Vasu. Just light it. - No need. We will tattoo that you are Shiva, okay. Light it. - Do whatever. Don't act too smart, just do as I say. Light it. Look at his face. No need Vasu, why are you doing it, leave. Light it. But when he reacted the first time. The whole of Mangalore got to know who he is. That day was August 13th. 2008. How many in total? - 10 is enough, brother. Why only 10, take 20. No need, brother. It will get spoiled. No, it won't get spoiled. Give 20. - No need, brother, no need. Just take it, nothing will happen. No need brother. Take this biscuit. Hari wanted to live. He wanted to something big and be known as big person. He had everything needed for that. If it remains then give it back. Bhaskar! Bhaskar! Take these snacks inside. Brother, 2400. Next time, give all the bills together, okay. Need the payment in cash this time, brother. The last times is also pending. Where will we run off to? Will give, wait. Settle it off now. What? To whom are you talking to? Do you know what you're talking? Do you know whose bar is this? Whosoever the bar belongs to, give my payment, that's enough. What? What? What did you say? What? So what to whom the bar belongs to. What did you say after? You need the payment, that's it right? I will settle it off to you right away. Despicable fellow, you need settlement? Go, they will settle it. What is it? Tell what? What do you need? Payment was pending, I asked. Money. I have to give you. Right? Right? How much? Tell. Tell. 2400. Have to give 2400. If I won't give? Huh? Talk to me. It's earned money. Despicable fellow! Whom are you talking to? What are you talking? Earned money? So, is ours not earned money? Huh? Talk to me, why are you not able to talk now? You spoke there, talk now. Hmm. "To the Almighty Shiva beloved of Parvathi," "Salutations to him who has the moon around his hair lock" "wearing the skin of tiger as his dress and holding the bow" "wearing the skin of tiger as his dress and holding the bow" "Holding the river goddess Ganga on his hair" "Controlling the speed of the flow through his hair" "wearing the skin of elephant" "To the Almighty Shiva beloved of Parvathi," "Salutations to him who has the moon around his hair lock" Did he beat him up because he showed Gun to Hari? No. He had beaten everyone on that day. Till then whomever he was not able to beat, he had beaten them all. From that day, Shiva made it a habit. Whomever he beats, whomever he kills, he used to wear their slippers and walk around. "Wearing Rudraksh necklace in the neck" "you're the greatest devotee of Shri Vishnu" "You are the dearest friend Shri Vishnu" "who flies on eagle as his vehicle" That day he killed rowdy Shetru MA Kere Dayananda. He had beaten him up so badly that, they had to collect all the 17 teeth from the ground. Go in. Hari brother. Brother, I am Shekar. In Mavanahalli Devi I sell the flowers. I know, tell me. The temple's people are asking to open the shop. I came to ask your permission. Sir. Hari brother, talk fast. Hello! 'First time I was getting respect in life.' Yes, true. 'A little more itself.' There's some flower shop it seems. It's our people. Okay. He won't open. - You can keep the phone. If you need anything, make a phone call. Bye! 'Got the phone.' And the clarity as to in which way I have to walk as well. Got a new member along too. One, one, one, one. It's one, one, one. Two, two, two. Two four, two four, two four. Two and half, two and half. Three for once. Three, three, three. - Four. Four, four, four, four. - Four and quarter. Four and quarter, four and quarter. - Four and half. Four and half, four and half. 4.70 once, 4.70 once. - Five. Five, five, five, five. Five, five, five, five. Five for once, five for once. Six, six, six. From Chit fund dealers in Mangala Devi till the ones who watches over footwear, everyone had to give one share. Before coming out Hari had made as much money needed for bail. With the remaining he brought a second handle vehicle for Shiva. For 10 months and 17 days, they both came out. - How many teams has been registered already 8 teams. - 8 teams are there? Many more will come, right? They will. - Okay, okay. The arrangements must be perfect. Okay? - Look there. Stop him. Stop. Hey stop. Stop. Come, come. Come. What? Does this road belong to you? No. - Then? Despicable fellow! Are you acting? In front of whom are you acting? Go and tell those useless fellows, once brother's match is over, he will get inside Mangala Devi and beat them up. Will you tell? Huh? Go. Go! Despicable fellow! - He is a manager of the drama company. When is the match? In two days. Has it been a year since that despicable fellow died? Don't go out for the next three days. They said they will come here, right? Let them come, we'll see. It had been a year since MA Giri Dayananda died. His gang had arranged for a match in his memorial. Before that could end, they were telling all that they would kill Hari and Shiva. Are they there? Okay, come let's go there. 'By evening' Has the vehicle come? 'in whose ears it shouldn't have fallen,' When? it had fallen in those ears. Write down the names. Huh, don't forget. Hey Hari! Come. - Where? I said come. - Have got work. I said come, I will tell you, come here. Sit down. - To where? Sit, I'll tell you. Okay wait, let me wear my shirt. Come soon. You touched Shekar brother's body? Did you dare to touch Shekar brother's body? - Shiva, Shiva! Don't you know who he is? - Shiva, Shiva, Shiva. Shiva, Shiva, Shiva. - I really don't know. I swear I don't know. We have come here for work, isn't it? Why do you need all this in the place you have come to work? Where is he? I have come only for work, I really don't know. He has come for work, he don't know. Shiva! - Ask him to come despicable fellow! It's not worth, come Shiva. - Leave, leave. Leave. Just come. - Leave, leave me once. Leave me, I will just talk. Despicable fellow, what's your match fees? - What's your match fee, despicable fellow? 450. Give me 450. - I didn't bring money. Brother, it's okay you can give day after tomorrow. Then write down. Write down as Mangal Devi team. Our team must play the first match, understood? Tell to this despicable fellow. - Write it down. Brother, shall I write Mangal Devi cricketers? It will look nice. - Okay write. Some fellow told he would come to Mangal Devi and kill us. Ask him to come on that day and kill us. Whose team are you in despicable fellow? Which team? - Come, come. In a cricket tournament done for person's memorial, if the person who killed him was playing the first match only the ones with strong nerves had come to watch cricket on that day. Nominations are happening. This time, the captain of the Mangala Devi cricketers Shiva Mangal Devi and the same way opposite team's captain Ashwin are competing. Toss. - Lucky toss win is won by the Mangala Devi cricket team. I can play. Will anyone play in our team? I will play. Give your name. Name. - Kishore Kumar. Kishore. Kishore Kumar. Kumar. - Kumar. Despicable fellows, none who played day before yesterday is to be seen. We will do it here. I have the knife in my hips. Let's play. 'The courage they had while touch Shekar's body' was not there when Shiva and Hari came to the ground. The whole MA Kere team were hiding on that day. Shiva is on the batting. And on the other end Shekar is to be seen. This time the batting is done beautifully by Shiva. Runs are being made. Run. New player, Kishore Kumar this time is facing failure one after the other. He is unable to play. Kishore Kumar in throwing ball. Why are you doing full toss? Is that how you ball, despicable. How many times will he say, Kishore Kumar, Kishore Kumar? They are making good earnings because of Kishore Kumar. Though he faced failure in batting, even in bowling he is being a failure. Mangala Devi cricketers are facing the failure. That day Mangala Devi team lost the match. But the MA Kere area won easily. That was the day the Mangala Devi gang was born. When they came there were three of them. While going they were six of them. Will you take and go, brother? If you don't pay the loan, what can I do? Bank guys will ask us. I should do something, right? - Are the bank guys your father. Or are you born for the interest? I don't think the talk is going good. What will you do? If you are born to your father, take one vehicle from here and go, let's see. If you are born to your father, take one vehicle from here and go, let's see.

Yes, we have got Hari brother's. - Do you have now? They said it's down because of the wind. It did not fall for the wind, we made it fall. If you need cable, let us know. - Okay, okay. Brother! - That's ours as well. Sister! - Cable, cable. Call us if you need cable. Is he the Prakash from here? It's his number. He has distributed pamphlets everywhere. He has told everyone. That he was the one who cut off our cable. Despicable fellow. When is it? Dassera in Mangalore means Tiger's disguise. That year Hari's team was also doing the Tiger. Move it a little towards this side. Tie it at the bottom. Tie it tightly, yes yes it's correctly, leave it there. Tie it tightly. A little binding in the behind.

Did you call them? Hari and Shiva used to climb up. Prakash who was ruling Mangalore for 18 years, thinking to put some fear in them, he broke the dish antenna. Hey go, you line up next for painting. Prakash won't do mine. - Go man. But they were not the ones who used to fear. He threw stones at their cable. For revenge they brought in Tigers the same year. All those who used to be Tigers in Prakash's group, they all had come to Hari's group this year. They had brought them. They brought in Tiger's disguise to make Prakash jealous. To make him more jealous they did one more thing. In Mangalore Tiger disguise blessing started. Now it's become the prestige. Every gang will put in a tiger each. Those tigers will calculate and go to 20 wealthy houses. Those houses must throw money at the tigers. In lakhs. Prakash had a permanent 15 to 20 houses. Hari took the list of those houses. Do it faster, it's getting late. Hari's tigers went to all those houses. Come ahead. - Kids are there. Before Prakash. Slowly. Come soon. Come soon, soon. Shekar soon. Jump quickly, quick. Listen. Prakash's tigers come here, it will be a problem for us. Oh, Prakash will not come. He is dead. Come, come, come soon. Quickly. Coming Hari brother. Brother, there are many here. Seems like lot of people are there for the Pooja. Honor them. Make garlands and put it on these despicable fellows. If Prakash brother comes give this one to him, okay. So sad, this time his tigers didn't get even a single garland. At least let five rupees fall on them. I will go then. - Okay. It was raining during Dasera that year. Everyone knew. Along with 4 drops of rain 4 drops of blood also will spill that year. The next day of Dasera before the tigers would take off their colors, as a final token they must dance in front of Mangala Devi once. Prakash's tigers were coming from one side. And on the other side, Hari's. Why did you stop? Beat it, it was good. Beat the drums. Hey Prashanthu! Last year with us. This year a different team? Ah come, greetings. Made good amount of money, right? Even I wanted to give some money. Ramnatha, bring that bag. Pick up. Pick up, it's my money. Pick up. Pick up, despicable fellows, pick it up. You pick.

But we must inform you once, right Hari brother. People will talk otherwise. That we did this and that behind you guys. That's why and also because if something happens to you. it will come back on us then. That's why to clear off everything, to solve everything, I came to say. That's all, brother. I will go now. Break, yes slowly. Start. Why is this vehicle stopping off? What vehicle have you brought? Put the gear. The gears are like stone, it isn't moving only. Huh, what to do now? Now change the gear and go, raise the accelerator and move. Give the accelerator slowly. Go. Slow, slow, slow. It's not turning. What old vehicle have you brought? I told you to bring a new vehicle. Do it properly, put the clutch. Your vehicle should be good to do it right. Oh, what is this man. - What noise is this? Is this the only speed it has got? Put clutch and go. Change the gear. Clutch is not going in, how will I change? Stomp the clutch properly. What to stomp clutch, this is all it works. You cannot do it. No need, I have two days to learn, I will do it. I will learn, I don't need your vehicle. I don't need your vehicle. - Very good, very good. Why do you say like this? You don't know to do it. - The vehicle doesn't move at all. If you don't know to drive, what can I do? I told him in the morning, don't take the vehicle and go, Sushanth. I cannot look at him. The vehicle has got crushed. He went in full speed. That opposite guy also came in full speed. He hit him very badly and went. I cannot look at him. He has been broken into pieces, he is not our Sushanth. So many pieces of him were not found too. Did you find his slipper? Who gave the bribe? Hmm? Looking at your face when you came home, I got to know. Who gave him the bribe to kill? Don't you know to speak? Who gave the bribe? Bobbehani. Did he take it? Hmm. Tell Bobbe, to that despicable fellow He is from Mangalore and you can't even pluck his hair. Throw this on his chest on behalf of me. I will leave now. Have any other songs? - Yes, shall I play? Play devotional song. Go towards Kathari side. Do you have things to take bath? No. - Stop near the shop and buy. Stop the vehicle in the side. Brother, take the jasmine. - No need, go. No, he asked me to give it to you. Take. No need, go. No, he asked me to give you. - Who? Someone Mumbai's father. Where is he? - He left. He asked me to give this to you. Also, he told you not to go to Kathari for temple. You must go to Mangal Devi it seems. And send the vehicle to Kathari. Don't talk like fool, go. Jasmine? Get lost. 'Someone Mumbai's father.' Shiva, come. Come. Where? Where? You go. You go to Kathari. To where? - Come, I will tell you. Brother, to Mangala Devi? Come sit. Hello! Where? Go to Kathari.

Also' 'We all speak a lot about humanity' 'Not just us everyone speaks' How are you? I am alive. Good for you. Why do you have the urgency to die? Another died instead. You escaped, right? That's enough. What do you want? You saved me, so what do you want? Are you any different? God? What do you want it seems. I am Raviraj. I was abroad for many years. Now I want to settle down here. I know, I saw you once in Dubai. Oh, you know. If you know so much, there is one who don't like me here, tell me who is it. If you're this good, no body will like you. That's also true. But still there is one who doesn't like me at all. Tell me who that is. The one who is sitting in the last, wearing white shirt. MLA Tell why doesn't he like me? A different party, is that why? Same party, that's why. He is afraid that MLA would give me the seat next. Hey no need Swami. How many times will I give, no need. No need, let him give this time. He is Hari. It's Hari, announce. 'Hari must distribute' 'school bags and' 'books to the students' It's time, we have to leave. 'Unexpectedly our chairman' 'has to leave. From our school' 'let's honor and send him off' He started off one by one thinking I will become the MLA. He has got a dog in the department. A SI. Keeping him in hand, he is raiding all my place. I can get that dog transferred anytime I want. But no need. Fear must be on his back. Do so much and give. I will solve your problem by talking to the Mumbai guy. What should I do? Where? Sir, there is a shortcut here, sir. Let's go from there. One minute I will be back. One minute. Beat him. Not necessary that big things must happen for the life to change. That night my life too would have changed. But that day. I didn't realize that as well. Hello! - Hello, when will you come? I cannot come. I have come to Hasan, Home Minister also have come.

Sir, Mangalore MLA had called. They are asking to put a strong SI to that Pandeshwara station. The current SI has some problem. - Put this guy. Brahmayya, put him. Looks like he is a little courageous, let's use him. That's it, I got transferred to Mangalore. Before I could step into Mangalore, the whole place knew about me. The whole city was talking. That I have come here to finish Hari and Shiva. They too welcomed me pretty grandly. Beloved Brahmayya, we are glad you're coming from Hassan to Mangalore.

Who is that dog? - Listen to what I have to say. To touch my boy. That despicable is my brother in law. If you touch him, my respect will be hindered. Does Shiva know? Does Shiva know? - No. I will fall on your leg, please don't tell that Shiva. What is brother, falling on leg and all. I will bring that despicable tomorrow. Should he fall on your leg, I will make him do it. I'll make him say sorry. But Shiva shouldn't get to know. This shouldn't repeat. I swear it will not repeat. How much did you give? - For which one?

Will you arrange something now? Or should I do? Nobody got to know. How the news reached Shiva. Someone made it reach him. - Neethu. Huh? It's good to say a word to Shiva brother. Hari brother told not to say. Then what? After getting hurt it is direct compromise? That's last, sir. Let Shivanna beat him up. Then we'll compromise. What's Shivanna's number? Shiva stabbed him and went to jail. For the first time in his life. Alone. Six months Shiva didn't come outside. Hari didn't go inside to see him even once. Shekar was trying to get bail for Shiva. Hari was not receiving Shekar's phone as well. No matter how he tried, Hari was not been able to reach. What is it? - Is Hari brother not at home? Hari brother? Don't know Shekar brother, he has gone out somewhere. I tired calling him many times, he is not receiving the call. Is it so? I will inform him once he come. Once he come as him to call me. Bye. - It was calm for 6 months outside. It was known. It was the calmness which comes before Tsunami. I prepared everything. Each one of their phones were tapped. Hari, Raviraj, Avinash. All their phones. Send everyone out. Will get the bail it seems, after a month. There's no problem here. Only thing is they don't put salt in the porridge, that's it. Otherwise there's no problem. Are you feeling bad, Shiva brother? - For what? That Hari didn't come to see me? He might have got other works to do. How is your hand? - Hand is fine, brother. Can play cricket now. Don't play cricket with that ahdn, fool. Okay, who plays well now? Kishore plays well now. That pony tail fellow. Is it so? Is he batsman or bowler? He is all rounder. The ball will not touch the ground. He plays so much? He doesn't play cricket, no other problems from him. Shiva brother, should I throw fast or slow? Just throw, throw. Don't act too smart. I will throw fast then. - Just throw. Oh! Oh! What a batting. The wind is blowing. - Just throw man. I was in jail for six months. Throw a little slowly, so sad. No need, throw fast. Don't act too much. I will throw slowly. - You just throw, man. Look, look, now look. See, I hit now despicable fellow. I did hit. - I am in the field. No, your father is there. - Hey don't tease.

Avinash had arranged Vamanjur gang. That day in Mangala Devi it was the festival of Maha Kali temple. Shiva would be found alone that day. They had fixed time for him on that day. Listen, we will kill that despicable today. Don't make it dirty by doing it half done. Stay on line. Okay, okay. He too was waiting for his death. I too was waiting.

I saw him when you were in jail. I have seen him before you. This despicable will get from my hand, tell him. Definitely he will get it. - Shiva brother. To that despicable house, I am tired of running to his house for your bail. Ask them. Tell him. Ask him to go, I am being serious. Ask him to go. They gave information. - Shiva brother.

Shut up and sleep. I will call him tomorrow. And ask who and what it is. Shall I? Who told you? That's why I ask you when you call. Shall I call him directly and ask? He won't do it, Shekar. What will he do without me, tell? Sleep. What? - We just came here. We came nearby. I told you he won't do it. Understood? Why will he kill me? Why will he kill me, Shekar? Hey Shekar? He won't do anything like that. Check properly and speak, Shekar. I will ask him. Why will he try to kill me? Huh? Shekar. What? Shiva brother! Hey Shiva brother! Shiva brother! - What is it?

Hey tell if Hari was there. Hari killed. Is it our Hari? Hey despicable, can't you hear? It is Hari who killed, what more proof do you need? Let's go to Kathari. Fool where is your Kalash? Despicable, send more people to kill me. I will do Kalash every week then. Before that you will die, I will take you in a week. I will kill you even before that. Are you born for your father, whom are you cheating? If I don't kill you and put a round in Mangala Devi. I am not born for one father. Start the vehicle. Can't believe.

It's doubtful about him here. Few days everything was heard. One day no one was talking. Hari, Raviraj, Avinash, no one. They got to know I guess. They became silent. Despicable fellow's vehicle.
