"Libélula" (Skimmer Dragonfly). From the Latin "Libella" (level on a set of Scales). Insect thus named on account of its fragile flight suspended in equilibrium. Let's go! Fuck, what's the hurry? I'm starving. Wanna get something to eat? Yeah, you? This rocks. Nice and short, right? J's gonna love it. You would totally rock this. Chill out, drone-boy. Yeah bro, just another 8 hours to stand on your feet! Keep it up! Stop! Stop! I'm shitting myself! Hold on! Don't let go bitch. Hold on, Cata! Don't let go, please! Check it out! Watch, watch, watch. Imagine doing that, huh? No. Can't. God, that's rough. Ever since I can remember, everyone wants to leave here. I've done it a thousand times in my dreams. I close my eyes, I grow wings and I fly real high but then my wings break and I fall. Faster and faster, till I hit the ground and I wake up. Do you know the three leading causes of death? Stroke, heart disease and cancer. I've always been obsessed with death. Every two hours someone in this country takes their own life. But they've taught us not to talk about it, to see the glass half full, to be okay with it. But it's hard to be okay when your mom isn't here anymore. It's hard to be okay when there's no jobs, and you're running but you go backwards, and so you look in the rearview mirror, and see your sister, following in your footsteps. And your daughter is following right behind her. My sister Alex says she's leaving. That all she needs is a lucky break. But in this town, I don't see lucky breaks, just things that are broken. I was born surrounded by this deceptive greenery. It gives you a false sense of peace. Fools you into thinking maybe things aren't so bad. But the green just gets darker, day after day. Look Maya, that's your aunt Alex. Auntie? Mhm, Auntie. She was your age then. And next to her is Cata. You know? One time they ran away at night, with food, clothes... Why? Because they wanted to be dancers in Las Vegas. Took a bus and, I don't know how the hell you did it, but you even made it to the airport! But a security guard saw them and, well, he called the police and they were brought home that morning. Really? Mom was furious. It's kind funny when I think about it. Alex was brought back here the way I see most people leave: in a cop car, with sirens and lights blaring. J, get over here. Come here and look. Going to Rubio's after dinner! Coming. What? Go on... Fuck, and Ricardo arrives, and in the tussle someone drops a bag, and this guy's cracking up cause they caught him off guard... Wasn't mine, man, it was Peñi's I bet... So what? That guy's a fucking son of a bitch... You know? Well, I think he's hot... Yeah man, but, like, imagine you had a whole kilo, you know? Why the fuck would I have a kilo? This guy's tripping... I dunno, man. Guys, a whole kilo of coke. I'm not gonna have a fucking kilo of coke in my life. Yeah, but imagine. Say 200 grams, just like that. Someone gives you them, you find them, whatever. What do you do with it? Someone give it to you? Don't take it, it's a setup. You find it? So you give it back, got it? I'd go see your mom, she knows about that shit. Yeah? Or I go see yours and get a blowjob. Let's go dancing. So, we gonna go somewhere to dance? Where? I dunno, Sabadette's? Fuck, man... Let him have it, he's a growing lad. Go on, give him 4. This is nice, right? Fuck, this is nice, man. Come on... Ok, but explain it all to me... See the phone? What? Do the whole lot bro. Fuckin' crazy... What do you mean I don't get it? Catalina Álvarez. Gender: Female. Age: 23 years old. Ok. Motivation letter? I'm from these parts, born and bred. I know everyone round here and I have people skills so I can deal with the public. I'm responsible and the thing I value the most is loyalty. Maybe because my mom left before I got to know her. And because people who were important to me failed me when I most needed them. So, I value loyalty: being there, not failing someone, and I guarantee you this: if you're loyal to me, I'll be furiously loyal to you. I won't fail you. I remain at your entire disposal. Yours faithfully, Catalina. Happy birthday to you! Coming! What is it? I'll bring you more. And change that for you too, ok? Come on. Wait, wait, slowly, slowly, slowly. Come on, let's have breakfast and then work on pronunciation, ok? Yes, we've been very lazy recently. WA-TE-R. HO-U-SE. SE SE, very good! Maya! Be right there, ok? What's up Chino? What's up? Where's my sister? Outside. Ok. Vera... I'm sorry about this morning. I hung out at Rubio's last night and completely forgot... Didn't even realize... I don't give a shit what you do... Ok, look, I do give a shit, but I'm sick of lecturing you, Alex. Wake up. It's about fucking time. Grow up just a little. They're fucking calling me from the fucking school asking why the kid's never there! I can't handle it on my own, Alex. Alex! Are you even listening? I am, fuck, don't wear out my name. I hear you. I already said I'm sorry. Go on, take Maya home. Go. You done? Come, let's go. You gotta be kidding. Hey, Fran. It's me Vico. Yeah fine. Well, no not fine, look, write this down. 60-40... You want my badge number too? Cancel it. See ya later. Fuck. Auntie, d'you believe in God? In God? No. God don't exist. And if he does, he's an asshole. So why wear that cross? This? Mhm. Cause it was a gift and cause it's solid gold. Yeah right, solid gold. You wish. It's plated, if you're lucky. It is too. You want water? So at school they say that God protects us. You study religion? Mhm. So, what else they say in class? That God looks after us, that we have to be nice to each other and to always tell the truth. Well, that's good. Well, that's me screwed. I always pray mom doesn't get sick again. Well, mom works really hard at all that, for you, and for me. So... if I wanted something, could I pray for, like, a sports car? No! Well, I want a moped! Well, that's no good to me, is it? Hush baby, keep it down or we'll disturb Nacho. Oops, sorry. He seems more perky today, doesn't he? Yeah, you're looking good today, ain't you Nacho? You bet, cause at night, it's... And he can't eat on his own? No, my love. Some things I have to help himwith. Like eating or having a shower. The other day, he almost dove headfirst into the bathtub. Missing his summer days, I'd say. Nacho, Nacho, be careful. Didn't you? Fancy a dip? Sign here. Name, ID number. Ok. Hand this out for me, ok? Thanks Alfon. Alright. A coffee and we're off. Perfect, thanks. Let's do this... Ok, so I'm seeing new faces. I'm Flora and I normally lead the group. Basically, what we need is for you to feel that this is a safe space. A place you can be and say whatever you think you need to, because no one is judging. Hearing other people speak, or seeing that they have gone through the same things as you, can often help. What is the worst I've done because I was drunk? Who have I hurt the most? What have I lost? What could I still lose? So, I don't know, it's an exercise. Just think. Ok? Thank you. Rubio, keep an eye on her with the dog. STAFF WANTED D'you see that? What's up Tanya? Hey, Cata, what's up? What's with the job? Um, check with Manuela in the office. Shit, sorry. Fuck, I'm so hung over. Can't see shit... Hm. Want some? Cakes? Mhm. On the house. Diapers, right? Mhm. Aren't they with the toilet roll? No, next to the tampons... Thanks. So what? So, right now everything's cool. They have so much shit they'd never notice some missing... Yeah, 'sides they don't even know I'm your son. But anyway, as you were all paranoid and shit, Alex has been the one going out and doing the asking... Good. So, I'll organize it. Then as soon as it's sold, we're gone. That same night, next morning at the latest, I don't care, but we are gone. Ok? Ok. Sometimes my friends take the piss. They're like: "J, you piece of shit". Call me a wuss, a pussy, pussy-whipped, all that shit. So maybe Alex has a stronger personality than me. So what? I love her. I love her and I'll say it out loud and they can call me whatever the fuck they want. So I follow her around? Sure. I don't think it's weak to fight for what you want. So we leave and we start from scratch. I think you have to be fucking brave to leave it all behind and put your faith in one person. Yeah, that fucking day with the currents... it dragged you like three or four meters. Oh shit, when Maya was there? Yeah, it took her flip-flops. I was so scared I was wetting myself. I fucked up my knee big time. Fucking freezing, I was hypothermic. Not as cold as waiting for the fucking night bus... Frozen... What a nut... then I'd fight with Dani... Fucking Rubio, he was a dick. Was? Still is a dickwad. Nah girl, he's crazy for you. Yeah, he's crazy. Way I see it, it's like a leopard don't change its spots... Well... He's not like J. That guy loves you for real. So, I thought we'd be out of here as soon as we finished school. But here we are. So, we save for a few years and leave, like we always said. And have you saved anything? Cause I haven't. Hey, but I'm starting work next week. I talked to Manu. At the store? Mhm. Plus I think they also need shelf-stackers at night. I can ask if you want. Nah, I'll pass. I don't think we're ever gonna get the fuck out of here. Well, I'd rather die than live here forever. I leave or die trying. Trying what? I dunno. Find some way to forget this shit. Fuck, Cata, it's your sister. She still blanking you? Blanking me and not paying up. I woulda given her some serious shit years ago. Yeah, well, she was pregnant, ok? No, not ok, Cata. Don't start with that "oh, she's pregnant, oh she's got anxiety disorder", whatever the fuck. That's no fucking way to behave. And you put up with it, cause you're so good you're gullible. She had the right to want to get the fuck out, no? Leave it all behind... And you have the right to look her in the face and call her out for being a bitch. Go on, say something. No. Say: "You fucking bitch". I said no. She's looking at you. You better go... Hey. Everything ok? So, I have to go. Ivan's hungry and I don't have time to... You could stop by some day this week... or just any day? No, Cata, no. We've talked about this. You know he's gonna die and he won't even have met Ivan? He's your father too, you know? No. I don't care what he's like now. For me, that drunk was never my father. So I'm not your sister either, huh? Fuck. Let's just go. Look, I'm sorry. Truly, I am, I'm really fucking sorry, but I just can't. I can't and I don't want to. The one with the big cross rocks. I want that one. There's loads with big crosses. I'd want it with some color. Cool to have one like that. Yeah, we'll go that way. Come on. Fuck, I'm sick to death of this shit. Sometimes I wonder if it would be better if he'd died. I dunno. I wish I still had my mom. Even in that state, I think that would be enough. Although I never even knew her, I just come here and speak to myself like an idiot. No, love, don't say that. I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. Plus, you did know her. You had her 7 years at least, at least that's something. Yeah well, 7 years and a half. What? And a half, cause all the months you spend in the womb, growing and shit, they count. What? I swear, I heard it somewhere. Somewhere where? TV I guess. So you just believe any shit you see on TV? Babe, it's like this: you have to add half a year to your life. Get it? Cos you're growing, forming, and even though you ain't born yet, it counts. Fuck. Skin up and quit messing with my head. 'Ts how it works. So, let's see... So I'm 23 and a half years old? Yup. Well, I'm not having that. Well, tough shit, cause that's how it is. No, I ain't having it, cause I'm not. I'm 23 or 24, one thing or another, not... not something in between, no. So what? The older you are the better, the wiser. Course you would say that. Hey, I'm only two years older than you, bitch! Two years and half, isn't it? Or is it only when it works in your favor, you sly cow? That's right. Come on, let's go. Come on, hurry up. Hello mom. How are you? I wanted to come by last week, but I was, you know, busy. So, I came today with Cata. She's over there getting some flowers for me. Fuck, I don't know how to tell her. Cause I know she can't do it and that should make it easier, but it doesn't somehow. No, because I told her I'd wait for her and, and she's going through a seriously rough time. Nacho just gets worse and she gets more stressed out and I. I just can't find the moment. It's tying me u pin knots. Because I've known I'll be leaving for sometime, but now it's really gonna happen, and happen now, and she's no idea and I don't know... I wish it was her who had the flat in Malaga, and who could say: "Let's get the fuck out, Alex, let's go tomorrow"... But mom: What if I never leave here cause I waited for her? Come on, let's go. What's up? It's Vico. Send me a girl. Wait, not just any girl, send Eloise. Ok? Ok, later. Hey, pass me a baggie, I worked hard today. Come on, don't be so tight, gimme a wrap. So, you don't wanna hear what I have to say... You're not totally out of the loop lately. Don't look at me like that. They're offering snow around the here. No, they're not. I'd know if they were. No. Shitloads of snow. Shitloads, right? And how much is that? Half a kilo. Fucking junkie... half a k she says. Hey, it's true. Half a kilo? Of coke, right? Yeah. Who? I dunno. You dunno. No. You dunno? No. Get the fuck out. Hey Flora. Hey Vera. You should come by my house and take that case I said... it ain't heavy. Ok. It's got T-shirts and shorts... We could do with them... Are you ok? Yeah. Seriously, I am. And Maya. She ok? Yes. There, here you go. Ok. Shit, that's heavy. Yup. Ok. Hey, what about what we don't want? Chuck it. Don't want more rubbish in my house. Ok. But Vera, I do want the case back! Sure. See you later. Come on Vico, come on. Get it together. Come on, fuck, come on, the first thing is to tell Ingrid. But, who the fuck thinks they can move half a kilo in this shithole? Apart from Flavio and the Colombians, who the fuck could it be? We need to find out who the fuck's selling. And then fuck it, we do them over, take it and we're done. What's up Petey-boy? What's up? I done nothing man. Well, you know, same as always, Vico, but you know... Shut up. You know why I'm here. The coke thing? The coke thing. Yeah, they're like offering some shit around, you know? To who? I dunno. Who to? I dunno. Dunno. He doesn't know... You dunno? What d'you mean you dunno? Crazy Manu. What Manu? The old guy, with the glue. Bollocks. He's lying. You're fucking lying to our faces. You lying? You fucking lying? I swear, no, I... You lying to me? You don't fucking lie to me. How much? I dunno. Come on, I've got some shit for you. Come on. How much? A bar? Half a kilo? Half, half. Half a kilo? Vico, I was given this... And fucking take a shower, you stink. Go on, fuck off! Argh, almost got him. Shit, I can never get it... This one, try this one! This one... Go, go, go! Yay! I can't get it out, You need to get some run-up. I'm fucking useless. But bring up the gob first. Uf. Like real gob. Get some run-up, curve your tongue. Yay! Fucking loser! Let's go, I'm dying for a spliff. Loser took the whole gob. I don't wanna wear these... Don't whine. Beggars can't be choosers. Well I prefer auntie's... Auntie's clothes are too big. Look, shoes... size 4. We can keep these for next year. But I wear 3s. So put some thick socks on. Hey, what about this one? Like a top? Here, try this coat. I bet it fits perfect. D'you like this one? What about this? Yeah, I guess... hey mom, what's this? Give that here. What was that? That was nothing. That was a wrap, wasn't it? Let me look, Vera. Go on, give it here. It's not fucking funny. Not here, not now. If you wanna end up like mom, that's on you. Or end up like you? What was that? Like you. Fuck, ok, whatever. Yeah, like me. How can you talk about her like that? I'll say what I want in my house. Our house. She was my mom too. And this shithole belongs to me as much as it belongs to you. You've no idea what you're saying. You want it? Take it. Take it! That's not the issue. Who cares? But you should go. And go now. And don't ever try to tell me this house is yours, because it ain't. It's mine. Paid for by me, worked for by me, putting up with the whole neighborhood's fucking gossip. What d'you think? Mom left some inheritance? No. She left debts. She left jack-shit. And she left you. He's still half asleep. Thanks, hun. I want yours. Hey. What's up, all good? All good. You? So, it's on. Already? Yeah, my ma just texted me, they told 'em I'm going. So it's on, it's happening. So we know where? Dunno, fucking miles away. Right. And they buy it all? Nah, nowhere near. But 150 gs. What d'ya think? I think I love you. Love you too. You getting some? Your eye's looking better. Mhm. And that's real good. Don't put that shit in your eye again. Promise me. Swear it! I swear. I don't have faith, God knows I never will... In the Godella yard, there's a pool, though it never rained, It's the tears of a prisoner, who went in, never came out. When I get out of Godella, I will meet back with my ma, With a spliff in her hand, and a rose and a carnation... Yeah, Just like you, right? Got the hots for your boss. She ain't my boss. Admit it, Chino, you got the hots for Alex's sister. And Alex. Just the other daughter left bro. Asshole! Shut up and pass the bottle. So I got me a Supermotard, with road wheels and low handlebars. Got a light? That's a total trauma, when you learn Santa don't exist. What, you saying it was mommy and daddy? You're a dumb-ass. Fuck, I can't even remember. They told me early, so they could save on presents. Got a light? Guy in my neighborhood told me. My mom gave me my first kicks. Hooked you up early, right? I'm talking ballet shoes, you fucking asshole. We need shots people. Roll a spliff? A what? A spliff. A spliff? A what? A spliff. A what? No, argh! Say it, one, two, three... I don't get it. A spliff. Just say it: a spliff. Stop staring. See yas. You going? Yup. Got no shame. Oh fuck. I'm meeting J. I gotta go. Don't go. It's not so easy. It's not so hard. I'm going. See you later at the tracks, ok? She killed herself. Hm? Alex's mom. She killed herself. What are you saying? Everyone round here's always known. Alex found her when she came home from school. But she was moved out of the way and the body taken away real quick. She said she saw it for 5 seconds only, tops, but she won't forget those 5 seconds in her life. She remembers it like yesterday, but like, weird. Like, weird details: the curtain half torn off; the floor caked with puke and shit and pills; Vera in a hysterical fit. Can you imagine what it must be like to get home each day and see the same fucking thing? Day after day. You don't forget shit like that in your fucking life. Don't tell anyone we're leaving ok. Someone might tell her. Ok. It's gonna be the shit. Yo, Chino. What crazy motherfucker's gonna play here? Have you seen the state of it? I'm not playing here. It's kinda wet, isn't it? What the fuck? What the fuck you doing? Hey, hey, hey. Are you stupid? What the fuck you doing? Is that all you got? Chino! You fucking asshole. J, J. Stop, leave it. Get off, leave it. What's your fucking problem? He's a fucking retard, fuck him. What d'you mean my fucking problem? What is it? He's fucking dumb. Let me see your fucking face. Well, I'll be... What's up, Manu? Long time no see... How's it hanging Manuel? Fuck. Still living in this shithole shack. Huh? What d'you want? What d'you know about a half-kilo of blow? I know I don't wanna know. But someone's offered you some. Right? Right? No, no. No one offered me nothing. They come here asking if I know anyone might wanna buy it. But you know me, I told her to fuck off. Her? Her. Some blonde bimbo. I told you: it's the fucking Rumanians. You're ok, yeah? Yeah. I gotta go to work. You're a dumb-ass. This is the clasp. Wait, put that away. Like this. She holds me like this, and... What's with you? Better now? I dunno. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Fucking end of year dance... You have to graduate to do that. Yeah, but I... So what happened? I dunno, they're both idiots... Dad? What happened? Are you ok? Look at me. Look at me. Hey! His head! Look at his head for blood! Let's get him up, get him up. Come on. You ok? Dad! Listen. Look at me. Let's see. There you go. Come on, look at me. Dad! Look at me. You ok? You're ok, you're ok. I'm here. I'm here now, ok? He's ok, Cata. It's ok, it's over. It makes me so sad. I know. Course it does... Cata, what if we go out for a bit, get you some fresh air? Nah man. But he's ok. Come on, you need some fresh air, I mean it. We'll just hang out for a bit. If you bum out, we'll come right back. It'll cheer you up, girl... Don't you want to? Just a little bit? You do, just a bit. Let's get dressed up, change, go for a quick spin. But like, chilled, yeah? Totally chill. You guys party way hard. Move over. Shroom. Like it? You thick? So, what, don't you have eye-drops for redeye? Rubio! Come on, let's go, let's go. Hello! Hi there, what's up? Really? Hi! What gives? Evening... For sure, it's there for sure. Come on, downstairs! Come on, come on, come on, let's do it! Yay! Let's go! Come on, you're going too far. Chino, you're going too far. What me? No way!

You know what you're doing to me? After what you said to me? Asshole! After what? Rubio! Fuck off home, get the fuck out of here! Can you calm the fuck down? Sorry, sorry. You're not helping me. For fuck's sake! Sorry, sorry. Don't wanna talk. No, Lei, I can't... Look, we're going to sell some shit and... and so, we're leaving. What shit? Blow... well, with what we make and with J's savings and... well, I'm getting out of here, Lei, I can't take it here any more. It's what you always wanted, right? Yeah, I know it's late. She awake? In her room? Maybe she's like, well what about me, hey? And how are you? Well yeah, you're right, I don't actually give shit. Hey, I thought about a cellphone as a present. Look, Chris, I'll buy her 20 of the fuckers if I so fucking want... sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to shout. No, no, it won't be a transfer. Cause I have it in cash. What time tomorrow? The Rumanians I mean... We going or what? Nervous? Very. Go on, J. 'Think you're doing? Gotta count it, don't I? Dunno what the hell's in here. Wanna fucking count it? Get the fuck outta here, you piece of shit! Fuck off! Hey, chill dude. I said fuck the fuck outta here you shithead, Jesus fucking Christ. You're lucky I don't fuck you up. Fuck off! I'm going! Fuck, man! Outta here, shithead! Come on. Move it, let's go. Fucking hell! Fucking little dipshit... Oh shit, you're here... Of course. Since you didn't come I had to walk it. Right... hey, come, let's get going... You ok Chino? You out tonight? Nah, I'm on double shift. I'm trying not to mess shit up. Not to think she's played me, but it's hard. There's this Chinese proverb: "If you go seeking revenge, you should dig two graves." Stay down, and keep that dog on its leash... No need to stand up, sir. Why are you here? Hey! You're here because I let you be here, because I don't bring you in, because I want you to fucking be here, that's why... So, why're you selling drugs on my turf? Drugs? We don't sell drugs. Calm... No: fuck your calm! You can all fucking suck my dick! You know this our house? This is a fucking illegal camp, ok? And this is fucking plywood. And these? These are shitty caravans, ok? Why the fuck are you selling drugs on my turf? Who to? How much? Where? No sell drugs here, we do nothing wrong... You're really starting to piss me off... The blond one... that kid over there... who's that? Alexa, Alexa, do nothing wrong. Get over here, get her ass over here. She not sell drugs... Get over here. She no dealer, she done nothing. She just child. Shut it, shut up! Where did you get half a k from? I'm fucking asking her, not you! Get the fuck back! How did you get your hands on it? I don't do nothing! Please, we want no trouble. No! My head! What? Fuck you! What? What's your problem? You're a fucking dickhead. What about those kids in the hood who deal in shitty grams? Hey, kiddo, stop a min. I want to tell you something. Cause you're leaving, right? How d'you know? Mum told me. You're leaving with J and won't live with us no more. 'Zit true? Yeah, it's true. I don't want you to leave. But I won't hog the sofa no more. Or be late picking you up from school. I don't care 'bout that. I want you here. Cause you're my best friend. And if you leave, when we talk about family in school, you won't be with us anymore 'cause there'll only be two of us. No, no, because there's three of us and we'll always be three. You know I'm going to Malaga? You can see the sea in summer... Malaga's near the sea? You'll love it. You're my best friend too... Shit, I didn't want to cry. I've never seen the sea. Me either. Come on, two more... What? One more, crunch it there, and another, with your eyes closed even tighter. Hold it there. Dani! Hi babe! Hi my love. You taste of coffee. From a cafétière. Wanna party tonight, or what? Nah, I'm meeting the guys. We need to do pick-ups and get selling, you know. So what's eating him? Nothing. Some bullshit. He's spinning out. Yeah, he is... All ok with Alex, Cata? Fine, I guess... She's not picked up the phone in 2 days. She'll be with J. Like she's checked out... Right. Why? She hasn't said anything? Anything about what? Is something wrong? No, no, it's all good. It's all ok. It's just that Chino said... Said what? That they're going tomorrow... Going where? I thought you knew. They're leaving tomorrow with J. I dunno, they have money or something. They're off. Yeah, ok, stop fucking around with me, wiseass! Cata. What? Talk to her this evening. You're not fucking serious, are you? I'm sure she meant to tell you; she just hasn't had the chance. Talk to her, ok? You'll see. You! Kid. Get over here... Not disturbing you, am I? Hey. What you doing here? You won't call or pick up... Thought I'd come and see what's wrong... I texted to see what you're up to tonight... you gonna party? "Like every fucking Friday since I turned 16". That's what you always said, right? I dunno when you started thinking you had to lie to me. Cata... Cata! Cata... Shit. Maya, clear up here, ok? But wait here for me, I'll be right back. Cata! Cata! Leave me alone! Cata... Cata... I heard. What? That you're leaving. Who told you? Not you. So you don't give a shit... I was going to tell you... Really, when? When you were a million fucking miles away? Over the phone, yeah? No. D'you have any idea what you're doing to me? It's got nothing to do with you... You're being so selfish. It's my life! What about mine? What about ours? Hey? Because we were supposed to leave here together, we've been talking about it for our whole fucking lives, remember? That's the whole problem, we've been talking about it and talking, and talking our whole fucking lives. Because that's all I can do. Just talk and wait... Because sooner or later my Dad's thing will happen. But for now, all I can fucking do is wait, and you were supposed to wait with me! It's just that I've been waiting for so long. And... I was going to tell you, I swear I was going to tell you, Cata. I swear I was going to tell you... How can you have been with me every day, hey? And look me in the face and not say anything, hey? Because... Cause I was going to come back for you... Yeah? You were gonna come back for me? Yes, I was never gonna leave you here. I was gonna come back for you. No, you weren't gonna come back for me. You know what you're leaving here, right? Vera, Maya, and me. And you don't give a shit. Not true. It is. You don't give a fuck. No, I do give a fuck! Yeah, it's all the same to you, bitch. Think you're better than us, am I right? I don't think I'm better than anyone, Cata. No. Is this so bad? D'you think you're the only one who's messed up? You know what, Alex? If you think this is a fucking shithole, then tough fucking shit. Because you're this same shit too, bitch. You're this same shit too, bitch. You grew up here in the same fucking shit as me, and you've become this stinking fucking junkie who makes me sick, with all the shit you put in yourself, you fucking bitch, you selfish fucking lowlife dirt-bag! It IS fucking shit. I'm a fucking shit and I'm the first to know what this has all become. I can't take it anymore. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to turn into my sister, Cata. The way you're going, it's turning into your mom that should worry you. Know what I'm saying? You know what? What? I do think I'm better than this. That's why I'm leaving. You can hate me or be happy for me, I don't care, but I'm leaving. I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm sorry. I'm so, so, sorry... I'm staying. I'm staying right here. Each where we need to be... And that's all there is to it. Cata, Cata, Cata, maybe there is something else. I missed a period... What? What're you saying? Talk to me, dammit! Tell you before, but I didn't dare, Cata. I'm sorry. Maya, one more game, ok? Or you'll kill my battery. Shit girl, I can't pee... Come on, focus. What the fuck d'you think I'm doing here? I'm scared. Let's see... What is it? It won't come. Look, close your eyes. Close your eyes, dammit. Close your eyes, and: Pssssssss! You're a retard. I think it's coming... Right? Shit, I told you so, but you won't listen. You got it? Yes. Ok. Ok. Let's see... Hmmm, red..., no blue is positive, red is negative... Maya, I got my eye on you! Let's see... and yellow is invalid. What was blue? Ok? Ok, sure... Tell him! Ok, I will... Don't chicken out. I won't... How long you got left? Nothing... Just a minute. No, but it's my turn. You're too fast, take that! Which top do you prefer? This one? Or this white one with the back... The pink one! Sure? Yes, the pink one, the pink, the pink. Its looks cooler on you. And my hair down? Yes, like this: whoosh! Hello! Mummy! Give me a kiss! What are you up to? I'm helping sis look pretty. Have you had your dinner yet? Can I have a Coke? I'm off. Ok. Did you pack your bags? Got everything? Yeah, I think so. You alright? So get going. And have fun. But not too much fun, cause look what can happen... Sure your Mom ain't left? No way. Want to? Yes. What's up? Nothing. What are you looking at? You. And how you look at me... And how do I look at you? Like you're in love. You look like a dumb-ass. Want some? No. Just a little. Do you love me? You didn't answer before... What d'you mean I didn't... So... d'you love me? More than my own life. I love you too. You know that, right? Yeah. Oh, really? That better be true... Why? Cause... in a few months there'll be three of us. I just found out. Still want to go? More than ever. Hey shit man, careful bro. Let's go. Hey there! Come on Chino. Come on down! Hey you fag. Toni! You loser! Give it some, go for it! Look, do this, oh my God! Sit down. Stop it girl! Stop, for fuck's sake! Hey, check out my pee, look at my pee! Man, that's... Watch it, or I'll pee on you... Do you have a tissue, hey? Now walk like a duck. Ah, that feels good! You peed, right? Ok. See you in a sec. I love you girl. Call me, hey? Course. Cross your heart. Cross my heart. Go on, get inside. I'm going to pull your hair. I'm going to pull you over. He's out of it. Take his lighter! You light it! Miki, for fuck's sake! How's this my fault? Maya, come on, wake up! Your friends are at the door. Come on, hurry! Maya, Maya, come on! Come on, wake up! Maya, Maya. Let's go! What's for breakfast? Pancakes... hmm? Your feet are freezing... Morning you. My feet and my ass are always frozen, I swear. Come on, I wanna leave early. 5 more minutes... Maya, come on. Alex, hurry up! We're leaving it real late... Go on, fill your boots... Morning ma'am. We've a warrant to search this house. Yeah, get out. Get the fuck out of here, man. You fucking son of a bitch! Fuck all of you! J. No! My son! Shut up lady! Alex, Alex, Alex, What's going on Alex? What's up? Stop! Open up. Alex, Alex. NOOOO! Do you remember the 3 leading causes of death? Stroke, heart disease, and cancer. Well, way down near the bottom of that list, you'll find Alex's death from miscarriage. And then you can come and talk to me about lucky breaks, about half-full glasses and about the past. And I'll answer by talking about actual events, about things that break and about our day-to-day reality. When you die, you become a statistic, another number, leaving behind a hole, an emptiness. But emptiness is not supposed to weigh anything; you're not supposed to carry it on your shoulders for the rest of your fucking life. It's not meant to hurt so much. Emptiness shouldn't leave behind sisters or nieces, or partners. Emptiness cares nothing for friendships or dreams.
