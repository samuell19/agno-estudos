Screams "Whistles" Screams and whistles TV Newscaster: Police have been puzzled in the last week by what they describe as well-organized bands of 15 to 20 women on bicycles attacking men on the street. While the victims have claimed that these incidents were unprovoked, eyewitness reports have led investigators to believe that these men may themselves have been attempting to assault women. However, officials have condemned the lawlessness of such vigilante groups and asked for information leading to the arrests of the women involved. Maybe even their telephone numbers. We'll have more information on the 11 O'Clock report. Now here's Linda with the weather.

We are here ready to deal with every lie that holds women responsible for rape and prostitution. The lies of whole that hold our sisters of the street responsible for the harrassment all women on the street The lies they push the women into the street as quickly as they forces out of workplace (VIKTIMAS DE VIOLACION NO TIENEN NA) (Este tio es un violador. Destruye el Centro de Rehabilitacion de Violaciones) we dont have anymore usefor the antiquated notions of godness and badness. In other words there is no such thing,as far as our leaders are concerned, as a 'bad boy'.These are just sick people. ...to rehability the rapists.And they've cut back on everything else.Like the victims, you know,the women.They've received nothing.They've cut back so substantially that there's very,you know, little left there, and they can hardly service for the anyone.Even for other programs we were a woman, you know, has a emotional problems, there nowhere for her have to go So everyone is wondering, you know, where are we going to go from here, because we've been working out in the community, try to even educatingpeople, with pamphleting,we've been going door to door, we've put out a lot of posters everywhere, and we gained a lot of support, but in the other hand,potentional is beingthey problem So the women in the unit are ready to move, ready to scalate what we being doing but the problem remains that our faces are known. FBI: So this seems to complete the leadership of the Army.It is not clear how each of them fuctions or what connection they have with Norris. This is Radio Regazza bringing you the ladies new abservation its seems to be is very petuniar things is happened this days angry and uninployement people are riding in the street and the city is on fire with their rage now what you think the goverment plans to do about this situation inside be no move ahedad the billys club they planned suplain the jobs, with trainning programs or this housing? No, ah ah yo know what they gonna do? the same bloody tactics they pull before the revolution remember that im here and want you its gonna happen again they all ready started in the sufferboard and the grand skale we all poor and the other unployemtn be should dead economicly into the ghetto and then whats happen? its gonna be a dooggy time in the big city our goverment is gonna flear this areas, with the best mack imaginea book ,and is gonna send everybody with deep narcotiks,when they wanna weep or cry anymore -Now im thinking maybe is time to do something to make the goverment more wail or what you doing Or something unormal arrive -Look this stuff is nothing in here,-Is nothing at all, is junk! -Hey, look! I wanted everything the place is clean,i were through everthing,-All the deskses?.-Yeah.-All? -Obviously they protect theirselves, maybe we gonna through their houses -We gonna have to, beacause is nothing here, no names, no adresses, si his crap, nothing to going El show de belle gayle Good evening friends!Welcome to the belle gayle show im delite tonight to be able to introducing to you three young interpresment women who has a part as the work of the socially news developes in the Socially News Youth We have Pat Crosby. -Hello -Becky Dunlop and Kathy Larson. -Hi, aren't you from Phoenix Radio? -Yes, I am. -Im from the Women's Army.Have you heard about the Women's Army?. -Yes, I have. -Ok. we're being try to do right now is make people more aware of what's going on with the Army My reason for talking to you need stuff becuase i feel that in your position maybe you could help us out. -I'd like to say yes.But im working with others women right now and i wanna comminment myself with them Maybe we can talk about this some other time? All right? Belly Gayle: ...A couple of questions about problems that we hoped that ten years into Revolution we wouldn't be addressing any longer.How do you feel about all these small groups here and there talking ablout how we still experience rape how we still experience prostitution in our society? -I think the statistics will show you that thepercentage of rape and prostitution in this point is significantly lower than it was in pre-Revolutionary society.Obviously advadnesment it's impossible to talk about complete, you know, abolishment. because it's not the nature of this goverment, you know, it's a question of gradual movement towards something.everything option the point of view is not simply no longer -I don't wanna be involved with the Women's Army it's all talk and no action. It's all rhetoric. I've check it out and we're doing nothing in the community by putting out our music. -By as coming to you and asking and question sometime obviously what we've to change Let me pick up on something said earlier in our discussion about the restlessness, is the best word for it,because I dont think it amounts yet to a movement, nor do I suspect that it will. But the attitude and impatience of some young women might be interpreted as counter-Revolutionary.(Mujeres: Marcha con el Ejercito de Mujeres contra el sexismo) -Two things first of all.because the media, in the way of being dangerous to identify a number of demostrations on the streets as a growth to the number of women in a movement,because I dont think it is that And also think the situation with these demostrations has to do with the fact that this group of women have grown up within in the last ten years and have experienced this Revolution as the status quo. This situation seems to be about the criteria of exciment, romanticism, against the idea of Revolution which is being fed constantly.The means of revolution are being denied, because they lives in the structure which is prepared to give all that to this people so.. -So it is not about envy of the experiences that I had and you had. -You think the group will make you strong? -No! structure in numbers. Right? -Who say so? -Who say that? -I think i have no stress right here on the sofa -Take care of the house.You what you see take care of your house.-Take your kids away,just some do funny shit -We would have be prepare for -Yeah, righ! -That's a women gotta to get mind together becuase our minds is not together -How you get let she come together? -Yeah you gotta come together You gotta come together, you can go any group -Ok, dinner, join the forces? -No, i got no join the forces -Yeah right -You know what you say honey? -Arrested them, arrested all them, you know? -You do what you wann do -Let me do whatever I wanna do. -Ok, cancell that, cancel that. i do what im goona do and you do what you wanna do. -Of course!

Grave and inconsistences in the police records and in the courners report have led us to believe that Norris did not commit suicide but was murderd, assesinated if you will for political reasons. As a Party members and editors of this paper we have objections to Norris idealistic and separatist views however, we respected her commitment as a community organizer. It is cause alleged by the goverment that she was involved in arms dealings with the Polisarian Rebels sympathetic to her cause If that was so, why wasnt she allowed a fair trial? Evidence clearly suggests that she was murdered by the police or by the goverment agents operating outside any legal sanctions when Norris returned to New York, she had no weapons on her person nor was there any proof that she was suceessful in her negociations. To the partie's fear that she could rally an armed group of woman that an assasination was necessary. -do you want see this? Check that out no.... suicide no....she was murded we've got to do something about his we got the story out, we got make it clear the matter and we got cut this cover up we need media.

She was murdered because she stood up againstthe betrayal of women. We're being sold down the river, at home, at work and in the media. And now the president wants to pacify us with Wages for Housework -This is a specail news bulletin from NBC News. Four armed female terrorists broke into a newsroom of CBS this evening during the live Telecast of the president¡s speech on Wages for Housework. -The aim of the revolution was the equality of all men and all women and all people. Insofar, as these women struggle for selfish ends for ends that are women's struggle against the aims of all the people, which are embolved in this revolutionary goverment, those aims must be staamped out, by any means necessary. The means that are at hand for us the the means of the criminal law. What these women have done is utterly self-interested. They are not concerned with the progress of all of us. -Anything i can do. -Well. you can do all that can be done in the army .The most important thing of all is media, our media., the most important thing is comunication. And you've got a radio station.Your job is to see that it can't be quieted,that it can't be bullshitted out, and that we make differences.-If I may say so, this has been a very satisfying thing because it has proved an ancient theory of Freud's, that there is a primary female masochism, a deep-rooted, rock-bottom sort of thing. Of course we con't see that, what you see is the secondary manifestation, the reversal of that, the secondary female sadism.Ok? -The secondary female sadism? -Yes. All these so-called pranks. -You mean their the deeper impulse is masochist but they fear to express it in that fashion? -That's right. There's a terror of their own masochism. Music: -As the editors of the Socialist Youth Review, we would like to comment on the CBS break-in last week by the Women's Army In a videotape by of Zella Wylie, the Women's Army exposed goverment duplicity not only in the cover-up of Adelaide Norris's death, but in the repression of active feminism with Wages for Housework. We extend our support to the Army as a legitimate revolucionary group, because we, too, believe that the Party has been undermining the economic and social possition of women. Our goverment, wich has prided itself on being the first succesful socialist democrocracy, is neither democratic nor socialist. In forming an alliance with male Labor, the goverment has reinforced the caste system that has always existed in this country. Women fought the War of Liberation with certain expectations in mind: that the goverment would work, beyond reform, truly egalitarian society. But unless we struggle now for our rights, we will always be opressed but i struggle our now but we always be opressed. -Couple, posible this paper you check it and i also know the power of adelaide norris. malcolm into heroe -Is not only adelaide norris -she is right! is not adelaide norris we cant compromised my position continues to work for this newpaper -Wake up!rubin was muerdered in this street and you gonna sit back and watching happened sister - you better get it together and wake up! because all your babies, all yourself you gone be clean out, yo gonna run no more you're gonna be nothin or waistland, or waisland, sister, now get it together-It's time to fight! this is for all the dead heroes out there...

This is Isabel broadcasting from the new Phoenix Regazza Radio station I'd like to open up with a statement on behalf of Adalede Norris and the Women's Army. Her murder serves as a warning for women everywhere for the struggle we face. And the truth will be heard and the story must and shall be told. It is not only the story of women's oppression, it is the story of sexism, racism, bigotry, nationalism, false religion and the blasphemy of the state controlled church, the story of environmental poisoning and nuclear warfare. Of the powerful over the powerless, for the sake of sick and depraved manipulations that abuse and corner the human soul like a rat in a cage. It is all of our responsibilities as individuals and together to examine and to re-examine everything, leaving no stones unturned. Every word that we utter, every action and every thought. We are all, women and men, the prophets of this new age. And for those of us who would be safer in the sensibilities of racism, seperatism and martyrdom: if you can't help us towards building this living church, then step out of the way. The scope and capabilities of human love are as wide and encompassing as this vast universe that we all swirl in. One for all, and all for one-ness. This fight will not end in terrorism and violence. It will not end in a nuclear holocaust.It begins in the celebration of the rites of alchemy. The transformation of shit into gold. The illumination of dark chaotic night into light. This is the time of sweet, sweet change for us all. This is Isabel from Phoenix Regazza Radio, signing off until tomorrow." -Is time to ask if politicks and programss comes the new nation of today w ecant ignore the while abuse social programs,at home we nd the rest of the world this station fears over the socialization demostration into a wallfare state if we survive our ideas, we can careful this celebration, opinion BOMBBBBB!
