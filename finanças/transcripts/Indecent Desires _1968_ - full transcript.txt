- Hello? Oh, Babs. What is it? Uh-huh. Of course. All right, you can tell me all about it when we get to work. Well, I'm, I'm dressing. I'll meet you downstairs in half an hour. Now what you wanna tell me? - Oh, Ann, I met the most marvelous man last night, Monty, he's so, so continental. - Well just watch yourself. - Oh. - I don't trust continental men, especially if his name is Monty. - He's really something. Monty's gonna help me get a job as a dancer. He has a lot of influence. - Really? - He knows the most important people. I have a date with him tonight. He's so different and such a gentleman. I never met anyone like him before. - Oh, stop dreaming. - You don't understand. I just don't feel like working. I hope Mr. Dean stays away for a long time. He's such a pain. - Uh. After all, that's no way to talk about your boss. He is keeping you in little luxuries. - Yeah. Very little luxuries. Huh. - Oh! Oh! Oh! Hi! - Hello, darling. Mm. - Mm. It's good to see you. - Mm-hmm. - I missed you, you know? - I should hope so. Mm. - Mm. Where are you going? - Now you just sit down and make yourself comfortable while I get dinner ready. It won't take long. Everything's prepared. - Hey, Ann? How about keeping me company? - Oh, stop it! - What's the matter? - Nothing. Nothing. Ann, what's wrong? What's the matter? Why are you crying? - Go away. I never wanna see you again. Go away! - Ann, please, what is it? Tell me. - Please, Tom, just go! - What's wrong? - Leave me alone! - I want to know what it is. Just go! - All right, I'll go. If that's what you want. - I must be going mad. I must be going mad. What shall I do? What shall I do? - Hello? Oh, fine. Of course. Ann, it's for you. - Hello? Oh, Tom. I'm so glad you called. Oh, it wasn't you. It was my fault. Really? How long will you be gone? That sounds like a million years. All right, I'll meet you for a few minutes then. Goodbye, darling. Oh, how sweet of Tom. What are you doing here? I thought you were going to meet me at our bench in the park. - I couldn't wait in the park. - Mm. - Mm. Is that all right with you? - Of course it is. - But I had to see you before I left. - Oh, I forgot to thank Tom for the flowers. Huh! I don't understand. Mm. I feel good. Drunk. Mm-hmm. You're beautiful. Let it ring. I must answer the phone. All right. But hurry. - Hello? - Babs, I must talk to you. - Oh, Ann, I'm sorry, but I, I really can't speak to you right now. - But it's important. I really must talk to you! I mean it! - Listen, Ann, I can't right now. I'll see you in the office tomorrow morning and you can tell me all about it. Okay? - Please, Babs! - I'll see you in the morning. Goodbye. Hi. - Hello. Gosh, Ann, I'm sorry about last night, but honestly, I was so busy, I just couldn't talk to you. - That's all right. - What did you want? - Oh, nothing. - Ann? What's the matter with you? What did you do to your face? - Nothing. Let go! Leave me alone. - Hmm. - Everything is fine. All those horrible things, it must've been my imagination. I guess I'm just over tired. I'll take it easy for a while. It must be my imagination again. But this time, I'm not gonna let it get me. Hello, Babs. I better get to work. I'm late. I just couldn't get up this morning. It's the first good night's sleep I've had in a long time. - That's not like you. You're such an early bird. Hey, your face is better. No more band-aids. - Of course my face is better. I feel wonderful. - I'm so glad, Ann. I was worried about you. You were acting so strangely. I just couldn't understand it. Something was really troubling you, wasn't it? But the past few days, you seem to be your old self again. - That's right. I'm my old self again. - Good. - Everything is just great. - Say, what's with you and Tom? - Well, you know, Tom asked me to marry him. And of course you said, yes. - That's right. - I suppose you're meeting him tonight? - Oh, Tom's out of town. - He is? Really? - I'll be glad when he comes back. I miss him. Say, I forgot to ask you, how was your date with Monty? - Look, let's not talk about him. - Whatever you say. - Say, as long as Tom's out of town, how about having dinner with me and perhaps going to a movie tonight? - Sounds good. But I have to get a package at Tory's. I'll go there right from the office, drop the package at my house, and I'll pick you up and we can go to dinner from there. - Good, that'll give me a chance to go home and shower and change. It's almost five o'clock. Let's leave. - Kind of early, isn't it? - Well, you know what they say. When the boss is away. Come on. - Okay. - The door's open. Come on in. - What would you do if it was a man that came in? Look at you. - That would be nice. - Hurry and get dressed. - What's the rush? - I'm starved. Gosh, I'll be glad when Tom gets back. I really mean it. - I'll bet. What's the matter with you? You must be going out of your mind. - I am. I am crazy. I am going out of my mind! - Ann! - Oh! Oh. Oh. - Hmm. 10 O'clock. It's not like Ann. I don't know what's wrong. I don't understand what it is. Ann? Ann, it's me, Babs. Are you all right? Ann, are you all right? If you don't wanna talk to me, I guess there's nothing I can do. Just a minute. Who is it? - It's me, Tom. - Hi, Tom. - Hi, Babs. I'm sorry to bother you. I suppose I should've waited until you got to the office. - Oh, that's all right. - But I had to see you. - Sit down. - I didn't mean to disturb you. - I was only doing my ballet exercises. Maybe someday I really will be a dancer. - I just got back into town, and I've been calling Ann all morning. There isn't any answer. - I tried to reach her too and couldn't. Something is wrong with Ann, Tom. I don't know what it is. - What do you mean, something is wrong? - Well... - I don't understand. - I went to her house yesterday. - Was she there? - She was in her house, all right. I know that, but she just wouldn't answer the door. - I better find out what's the matter. - Yes, of course. Let me know if anything's wrong. - Thanks, Babs. I will. Bye. - Bye. Ann, it's me, Tom. Go away! - Ann, please! - Oh! - Ann, I wanna talk to you. - Please, go away! Leave me alone! Oh! - Just for a minute. Now be a good girl. Please, hon, open the door. - Oh! - Please let me talk to you. - No, no! - What is it, Ann? - You don't understand. I'm sick, Tom. - Let me help you. - You can't help me. No one can. - Well tell me what it's all about. Come on. - No, no. - Come on now. Sit down and relax. - Leave me alone. - Now you stop that. Do you hear me? Sit down and be sensible. There now. Look, I love you. Whatever is wrong, we'll work it out together. If only it was as simple as all that. - Don't you love me, Ann? - Of course I love you. - Then trust me. - Something terribly wrong with me. - What do you mean, Ann? Tell me. - I know it's not my imagination. - Go on. - I have a feeling that someone keeps touching me, following me. - Oh my God. - It's true. It's true! I'm not imagining it. - I'll make an appointment with Dr. Braun. He's a good friend of mine. I know he'll be able to help you. - No one can help me. Why don't you just go. - Now you just take it easy. Ann, I'm going to call Dr. Braun right now. Maybe he can see you immediately. - I'm so glad you're here. Help me. Help me. - Shh. We'll get married. Remember that little house in the country you always talked about? - Do you mean it, Tom? - Of course I mean it. - Hold me. Hold me close. Don't ever let me go. Promise? - I'll never let you go. I promise. - Oh, I'm so happy. I'm so happy.
