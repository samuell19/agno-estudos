Marriage will half the grief. Double the joy. And quadruple the cost of living. Then bye. It's a british proverb. Zero sadness, zero joy. And half your mortgage. Than bye goodbye. Are you serious? We just stay close. I thought we could understand each other without saying anything. My parents were like that. It's amazing it have a ideal couple as your parents. No, but that's it. Any man who's married to Toka-san will seriously be happy. NO Because, I thought you was really cute.

I believe we should have a proper chat. - Good morning, Natsuno-san. - Good morning, doctor. Good morning, Taki. - Excuse me, sir. - How is Taking doing Lately? Lately I've settled down in my life , but until now... I guess I didn't talk to him properly. I guess I shouldn't have. My wife left my son to me.. If you need any help. You can always ask me. Thank you. Bye. Be careful. Yes, sir. Hey. - Yes? - What are you doing? Pick-up? You're a friend of Dalia's, I saw you earlier. Stalker? You have names for everything. Don't you have school today? I don't like there because there are weirdos. What do you mean weird? Dahlia's account. Really? He's crazy dressed like this. Oh, thank God! I thought I was crazy! I know, right. That's how normal people should react. I don't know about normal, but I don't want to. I'm in the minority, so it's hard for me to live. Me too. -Are you from the island? - Only till junior high. I left after high school. Now? I sell beauty product in Ginza. Selling beauty products and doing make-up for clients. Why? Why the make-up? When I was a kid, my mum used to do my make-up... I thought it was magic. Do you like it here? I never really liked this place. They say the sea is big. But in reality it's so small. I don't like it at all, I cannot go anywhere. It pisses me off, like I'm being told what to do. Bang on! Worst! Just a little... That one comes first! - Damm it! I'm a girl! - It doesn't matter. Seriously, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Seriously, you've got to be fucking kidding me. Salty.. You're the one who pushed me! Nope! It was you. You did it first. It wasn't me. Hey, what are you guys doing? - Ah, Kazuo. - You know him? Hey, Kazuo, is this girl really an adult? She acts like too much of a kid. What? You were the one acting like a Rebel! You both are kids! Oh, that's right. Taki, I'll walk you to school. Toka - After that, you'll have to help me out a bit. - Kazuo. - Yes? - Thanks for everything. - No problem. We're getting a lot this year, aren't we? - Thank you, Kazuo! - No problem. See, when they say that... They're counting on you. No, it's more like they're counting on me. The manager, he's all smiles. The only thing he's good at is Smiling. Is there anything here? I don't see it. I was there until last week. Really? Toka resembles it. What? Ponta the dog Can you try it for a minute? - What? - Just try it. like this Okay. Oh, just sit down, like this ... Wow, you look so much alike! Ponta, come on. Look I didn't know they had rooms like this on top of the church. Looks like a house. Ohagi... Oh, I'm fine. Toka-san don't like it either? Sei-san don't like it either. - This is where we used to live. Me and Dalia. - What? I was a fisherman in Fukushima. Since then I've tried changing lot of profession. I came to this island for a fresh start. I started my own business. How long you know my father? Since your mother passed away, He's a good talker. Come here, have a cup of tea. We talk about all sorts of things. Is he gay? No, he said he want to be a mom, didn't he? I think it is his real intention. You know, when I lived here... I didn't have any money. I didn't know anyone. It was normal for us to have bread for dinner Dalia brought from school. Then Sei-san came to my house, invited us to a dinner. welcome! have this too, if you like. - What's wrong? - good! These rice balls are amazing. Really? I really miss it. I mean, it's like.. I've had a lot of practice at cooking. I've learned to make all kinds of things, but.. Only the rice cakes taste different. So, I dressed up as my wife to try it on. So it tastes same. Kazuki? What's wrong? I don't know what it is, but... I am not sure but, Is that so? Good. What are you doing? Having an affair? -Wrong -You know what? Kazuo is mine and sensei's, don't keep your eyes off from him. You probably won't get any inheritance. Why laughing? I don't need it, even if I get. - This? - just keep it light. Ok. Hey, that's a super vegetable! Me and Sacchan grow them in our farm. - Seriously? - Yeah. Amazing! - Yes, please. - thank you. Toka! Get the platter out of the storeroom. Hurry up, give me out. What's this? - I'm here~! - Good evening! - what is it? - Wait a minute. Don't take it. Wait... Okay relax, I'm sitting down, are you ok? I'm scared. Okay. Oh, my God. Are you okay? It's okay. Sacchan... Happy birthday! Congratulations. What? Thank you! Congratulations! Congratulations! Today I cooked a dish from my hometown of Samsana. - I'm so happy! - I don't know if it's suitable for my taste... Don't worry, they're our vegetables. - there's no spoons. - I'll go get some. - This one, we should eat with hands. - What? - The Sri Lankan way of eating. - Bon appétit. - Bon appétit! - Bon appétit! delicious Really? Thank God. It's delicious when you eat it with your hands! You're both spilling too much! What's that? - Why am I the only one left out? - Isn't it funny? That house is my parents' house! Mom has gone, dad became crazy, I'm feeling like a stranger. It's not the same at all. I think you're right. Peel my lobster, too. it was a joke! don't tell Midori, please. Mother, welcome home. Morning assembly is about to begin, everyone be quiet! Okay, then, we'll start the morning Assembly. We start with the principle. Where's the principle? He's absent today on the third anniversary of his wife's death. - Did you know? - Yes ... Dahlia, are you sure you don't want to go? It's okay, I'd fall asleep anyway. That's it. - Good morning! - Excuse me, Dalia. - Hello! - Hello! Midori, pickles. Take it. Okay. Thank you. When are the ladies coming? They'll be here around two o'clock. Everybody help me. Shrimps? Ok - Dad. - Hmm? What is the brocade in broiled egg? There's a town in Tokyo called Kinshicho. - I think that's where it originated. - No, it definitely didn't. - Then what is it? - I don't know. - Do you have any green beans? - Yeah, I've got them. - it smells good. - thank you. Okay, then. let us begin. Taki! Are you coming back? I'm not going back. I'll leave the island at sunset. Can Dalia come too? Can I come? What are you going to do when you leave the island? I'll look for a work while I'm out there, Will Make money, live the way i want. What's wrong? Did you and Dad have a fight? Why? He found me wearing make-up. I can't wait to grow up. What? Can't understand.. The smell of dahlia That's obvious! Cute smell. What's that? Even Taki smells good. - Is that so? - Yeah. Hey, do you have any make-up kit? I'm read - here we go! open this one too. Open them both. Do you have itchy skin? Hey, scary, scary! What? Why? Turn around! Turn around. facing down! Wow! - I don't drink. - He drinks. I'm a big drinker. I'm going to drink. Right? I cooked a meal today, in case you were wondering. no way Aoji made this. Toka! Why are you being so rude? Why hasn't anyone said anything? - Auntie, don't you hate it? - Don't like what? Your brother in law dressed like that... It's fine, it suits him. Good. He's a local teacher. Do you have any more of that new beer? Oh, you're in my way. Just a little... How long are you going to keep doing that? Because you're a spoiled brat. It's no use. - Traitor. - what? Dad. You didn't you tell me dad dressing as mom? Because you wouldn't have come home if I've told you. What about marriage? Why aren't you against it? Because, I think it's fine. Love is different for everyone. Don't be so open-minded, Just because you married a foreigner. What? Sis, that's... - I think it's good. - What? No, it's nothing. You know what, Momi’s the one who should be pitied, not him! I don't know what to say to mom. - Say it. - What? Why don't you just say it? Dad said he's going to put on mom's clothes and marry a man with kids. Stepdaughter is bit cheeky. But she's a cute high-schooler. Me, Sachan... I hope you're all doing well. We're going to have a baby soon. it's all perfect. Why don't you just say it? Don't talk so big. don't you know what's going on? - Anything we're missing? - Beer Dad, here. No, I can't. Let's Go Go Punch! I can't go on. - Go, go! - Wait, I can't go any further. - It's not going forward! - Hey, hurry up! - I can't go on! - Go! - Ugh! - Noisy! - Dalia Do you know her? - Principals daughter. What? Seriously? What are you guys doing? We're getting out of here. In a tiny boat like this? Can I tell you something? Are you crazy? Use a foundation that matches your complexion. Because he wants it white. Too white likes a clown! If you want to hide a bruise... You have to put in a control colour... What's that? I mean, that dress is yours. - What? - yeah - Dahlia made it, didn't she? - Sort of! Wow. That's great. - I want to be an idol. - Really? I want to be one of idiol surrounded by pretty things. Let's do it together! Combi, that's good! You're a comedian. Turn around. Comedian... You can't even do comedies. May I? Oh, it's fine. Who is it? Dahlia! White skin loved by the sun. Island Princess Dahlia! Okay, next. Taki, do it. I can be cute! I represent Japan! I'm Taki, the peach-coloured fairy! I knew it. Isn't the first phrase bad? Forget it, don't film me. Cute. Okay, don't film me. I'm hungry, I am going home. Why don't you go home, too? Dad ans mum would be worried about you. Mom, she's not here. I see~ You're just like me. Toka's teachers are his mom and dad. Principle dress like this at home, right? Don't you find it creepy? It's not the same as being Creepy, it's different. You are against principle, But fine with Taki? Well, you see. We're family, and sometimes it's unforgivable. I didn't really get hit. Truth is I was secretly doing my make-up. My dad found out. My dad's was so shocked I never wanna see him in that look. I'm sorry I caused so much grief to dad. I was like... wow... Myself I don't want to think about this. I can't believe I'm ashamed of myself. Taki, close your eyes. It's done. Here. Yeah, it's cute. Hey, do that to me. Wow. It's like magic. Ladies and gentlemen. I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you. I'm glad I found you. You dad came to my house. You had us all really worried. Sorry. Well, thank goodness nothing's happened. Dalia, you too. Already causing trouble! Are you really Dalia? Dad, I'm sorry. I'm not like this. You're an idiot, you know that? Sorry! Don't worry, Taki. I don't care how you look like. I don't know what you're talking about. You and me, two of us are father and son. That's enough. So no need to apologise. Don't runaway. after all the trouble I've taken to look pretty. Excuse me. I was jealous of you. Dress how you like. Don't worry about the people around you. I wanted to be like you. I'm sorry for everything. Taki. That's great. Thanks. Let's go home.

No way! Don't say that, you. Right, she's sad. Well, you know, you're alive. It happens, doesn't it? Yeah. What's that? What? What's that? I know what it is. I can tell. Why did you decide to marry my father? I wanted a family. I don't know if I and Dalia are gonna make it. To be honest, I'm scared. When Sei-san Said.. he is going to be a mother. I was like... wow. I thought we can be a family. I was glad. It's like you're using each other. I want a family. Sei-san misses his wife, he's feeling lonely. Are we using each other? Yes. Oh, I never thought of it that way. Well, still it's all right, isn't it? No, you can't. Marriage is... And that's not what it's about. Marriage is something else. Women, men... It's not just about love and sex. I don't know... As long as there's love, I think it's OK. We lost a lot of things. We've... He only gave me love, sei-san. Mother! Dad...
