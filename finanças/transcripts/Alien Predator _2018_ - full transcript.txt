What'’s going on? - I was working SATCOM support for unit 2, and-- - The recon mission on the crashed bird? - Yes, sir. They moved in radio silent, and about one minute later I received communication that they were under fire. SATCOM went dead about 30, 40 seconds ago. I wasn'’t able to hail anyone. Uh-uh... - What? What, what, what, what, what? - The body scan is a negative, sir. They'’re all down. - Come on. Show me. - All their body monitors are dead, except for Hobbs. - This was the last message that came through? - Yes, sir, at 10:17. - It'’s gonna be a long day. Long day... - Sir. - Adrian, what can I help you with? - Unit 2 is now down. They'’re offline. - Oh, jeez. I was worried this was gonna go sideways. Well, that'’s unfortunate, but we'’re just gonna have to sit it out until our second unit SEAL team goes in for its scheduled recon. - Sir, with all due respect, they'’re not gonna be there for five hours. - Look, I am aware of that, Lieutenant Colonel. - Sir, intel tells us insurgents regularly patrol that area. - What do you propose we do? - I propose that we send a chopper, sir, to scan for survivors. It'’ll only take about-- - Look, Lieutenant Colonel Adrian, you know that that area is a strict no-fly zone. I mean, we'’re as close to enemy lines as we could legally be at this second. - We can arrange for a fly-by. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-- I'’m sorry, soldier. We can'’t risk it politically. - Permission requested-- - Now let me tell you something, I am not gonna explain how we managed to get a chopper shot down behind enemy lines. - Permission to request to put together a team. I just need five or seven good men-- I'’ve got men out there that I trust with my life. - All right, listen to me. - Just give me-- - Lieutenant Colonel, listen. Unit 2 is an elite black-ops SEAL team. It'’s the best we have in-country. Now, I--I understand you'’re no stranger to black-ops missions, okay? But the men in this company are enlisted. - Sir, there'’s men in the-- - No, no--enlisted. - Sir, there'’s men-- - Rank and file. Now you are gonna wait, like the rest of us, for that recon team in five hours. Is there anything else you need, Lieutenant Colonel? Dismissed. - Carter. [ clears throat ] If I was to ask you to go AWOL to go get unit 2-- - You give the word, Cap, I'’m there. I'’m not about to let those men die out there alone. - We need to go ASAP. - Got it. - Be sure that you make Brooks part of the team. - Paul Brooks? - Yes, we need a tech. - But he was moved to SATCOM-- - We don'’t have a choice. I know the story, okay? I get it. I understand. But I also know he'’s ready to go back inside. Any other guys you want? - No, sir. - No? All right. - Of course, Cap. To hell and back. - First off, thank y'’all for being here. What I'’m about to tell you does not leave this tent. Now of course, I trust you all, but what I'’m gonna say is highly unsanctioned, with court martial potential. This morning, unit 2 went out on recon. They are now dark. The colonel'’s made it crystal clear he'’s not gonna authorize any backup for any rescue mission. You all know those SEALs. And Hobbs'’ life support monitor is still reading a heartbeat. Which is why I'’ll be damned if I leave them out there high and dry. - Exactly what are you proposing, sir? - I'’m proposing that we hump it to them--right now. Right now. They need help, like, yesterday and no ones gonna help in time. Now, I--I--I realize what I'’m asking you. I get it. Most of you have ran with me on these missions before, so you know I expect you all to come back with me. But you might not. - These guys are aren'’t a special op team. We'’re not even a unit. - We'’re not, but we'’re the best damn chance they got right now. I hope that'’s enough. - There'’s no option. It'’s the right thing to do, guys. I'’m with you, Cap. - I'’m in. - You all in? - Sir, yes, sir. - All right. Grab your gear. We'’re gonna push in 30 minutes. ♪ - Yeah, yeah, I don'’t wanna hear it. - All the ladies always gotta stick together. - You broads on the same cycle yet? - We'’ve heard it all a million times. - I don'’t know why y'’all being so defensive about it. Carter and I have been on the same cycle for three years now. - Because y'’all got low T. [ laughter ] - Yeah, that'’s right, sugar-- I got the lowest T around. Might as well put me in Guinness Book of World Records for testosterone deficiency. - Don'’t worry, Pete. One day, a girl will actually like you despite your personality. - Oh, thanks, Mom. - Will you all quit yammering back there? - Oh, Carter, don'’t even get me started on that guy. That guy'’s got so much T, might as well call him Mr. T. - Damn right they do. - Let them know, Carter. How you doing back there, Brooks? - I'’m good, Plante, I'’m doing fine. - Well, you look like crap. You nervous about being on duty again? - Nope. Why, are you? - Psh, no, man. I was born for this. - Look, we all been stuck in SATCOM, spent some time out of action. But you? You belong there. We all know about your little problem. - Plante, why--why are you still talking to this spaz? - Just killing time, baby. - You that hard up for entertainment, you gotta go and pester Brooks? - Oh, yeah. - Sklaroff, you heard about what Brooks did at the PX? - [ laughs ] Yeah, man. I heard he was wigging the hell out just trying to buy a candy bar or something. - It'’s bad enough that the man spazzes up every time he throws a fit in combat. But when we'’re chilling? What'’s that about, huh? - You'’ve had PTSD training, right? - Yeah. - I--I get anxiety attacks. I can'’t control when they happen, man. Sneak up on you sometimes. - But you know what else is sneaking up on you? It'’s troops-- enemy troops, insurgents. - Damn right. - So what--what are--what are you gonna do about that? - Yeah. I'’m aware, Mulloy. - We'’re about five minutes from the site, so we'’ll be out of treeline soon. The good news is we'’ll be out of sightline of any damn sniper, unless of course one of those fuckers pops up from a banana tree. Right, Carter? - Goddamn right, sir. - I realize that none of you enlisted for any black ops, in which case you sure as hell didn'’t think you were gonna wake up going AWOL this morning, so thank you. When shit starts to go sideways out there, just remember why we'’re out there. One--figure out what the hell happened to unit 2. Two--get eyes on whatever aircraft crashed, get photos of it. The little intel that we have suggests that it'’s highly experimental, in which case we need as much info as we can. So we need to figure out what it'’s capabilities are and what they plan to do with it, and why the damn thing crashed in the first place. And if all else fails, we at least have to get photos back to HQ. It'’s very important for you to keep your eyes up and watch your six. Carter, you good back there? - All clear. - All righty. Easy. Do not touch that. Carter. - Gotcha. - Move out. - All good, Brooks? - Yeah, I'’m good, Commander. - You get anything? - Everything'’s 5 by 5, sir. - Hey, uh... I'’ve been meaning to talk to you about-- - I know. - But I-- It'’s--I wanna tell you-- - I'’m fine, Commander. I-I'’m here to be your tech expert and lead technician, and that'’s exactly what I'’m gonna be. - Well, if the guys give you shit, just tell me, okay? - There won'’t be any reasons, sir. Let'’s kick the tires. You heard the man-- let'’s keep moving. Eyes up, be ready for anything. [ rustling ] - Faulk, Alvarez. [ rustling ] ALVAREZ: False alarm, it'’s just a snake. - You shit yourself? - Yeah--twice. How about you? - One and a half, maybe. [ lasers fire ] - Take cover, take cover! - Anybody got eyes on the hostile? Over. - Nothing to the west. Over. - I got nothing south. Over. - No movement here. - Everybody stay calm, keep cover. - I wanna make sure--shit! - [ lasers fire ] Where the hell is this coming from? - I'’ve got bupkis. Over. - I'’m not seeing squat over here. - Hang in there, hang in there. Brooks, get over here! Hang in there. - Shit! - Listen to me... - [ muttering ] - Save your strength. I gotcha, all right? Hey, Buckner'’s still with us! - All right, everybody stay tight. - Save your strength, come on. - Relax, buddy. - That'’s where--that'’s where the fire came from? - Relax, relax, relax. - [ muttering ] - Buckner says the fire came from up north, ahead. We need an end-around. - Alvarez, Faulk--fall in. - Sir, what about Buckner? - Brooks, how'’s he looking? - I-I think he'’s on his way out, Commander. I-- He'’d only slow us down. - Brooks, you piece of fucking garbage. There'’s no way we'’re leaving a soldier behind. - Enough! Brooks is right. We can'’t afford to drag him and dodge fire at the same time, not with the mission still at hand. Move to the southeast, hug the treeline. Over. Let'’s go. That'’s an order! - [ gasping, coughing ] - Nothing. - No movement anywhere. - Well, at least we know we'’re not the only ones out here. Stay frosty, everybody, not that I need to tell you that. Just stay on a high alert. Copy that? - Copy that. - Copy. - Permission to go back for Buckner, sir. - Permission denied. We need able bodies, and only able bodies, focused on the task at hand. - Sir, he'’s right here. - Permission denied, Plante. This is not a rescue mission. Not for the squad that had a distress call, and certainly not for us. - Fuck. - Buckner'’s dead. I just got his pulse. - Bring it in. Bring it in, bring it in, Plante. Plante, bring it in. You push that shit out of your mind right now. The only thing that you need to keep in your mind is staying alive. Copy? - Copy. - All right, fall back in line. Fuck. [ suspenseful music ] All right. - Way too quiet. - Cap, what the hell are we doing here? - All right, there'’s our target. Whatever the hell made impact is definitely in that building now. Gonna have to infiltrate. Oh...12 o'’clock. Plante, you seeing this? - Yes, sir, 12 o'’clock, I see it. - Brooks, what do you think? - Looks like some type of foreign tech, sir. All right, Plante, Brooks, Malloy, Faulk, I want you to head down to that area, scout it out, but be fast. Keep your eyes open for any movement. We need to find any traces at all of unit 2. Keep your radios open at all times. I wanna hear what you'’re hearing in case you get out of earshot. - Does that copy? - Copy. - All right. Keep your eyes up. - [ Woman ] Captain, we'’re not seeing anything at all yet. Over. - [ Man ] Yeah. All clear. Yeah, we got up in our end. Just stay frost, loose, and give me the intel. Copy. - Yeah, I'’m getting a lot of background radiation in this entire area. - What'’s that mean-- plutonium? - Maybe they'’ve got WMDs in there. - No, I just--I see a lot of traces of blood and... - What? - Gunpowder residue. there was a firefight here recently-- least that'’s what it looks like. - It means nothing. Our positions are still the same. Keep our eyes on the prize, and keep our head up. - Copy. - The hell is that? - I dunno, but that shit stink. [ menacing music ] - Shit. - That guy'’s from the other side. - I mean, you think one of our guys did that before he got got? - I don'’t know. - No kinda way his body could even do something like that. Brooks, got a guess? - Um...no. - Ah! Ayúdame Ayúdame me, por favor! Ayudame por favor, bajame de aqui- - Shut this guy up, he'’s giving away our position. - Los extraterestres estan aqui. - What? What is he saying? - Keeps saying something about aliens. - Aliens? - Alien soldiers, that they'’re near the building, I-It'’s not making any sense. - Soldados! Soldados! - Shut him up! - I'’ll be more than glad to shut his ass up. - Stand down! Malloy! [ speaking Spanish ] [ Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] - What? What'’d he say? - He told him he doesn'’t want him to give our position away, but he said they already know we'’re here. - I mean, is he really one of the deserters? [ speaking Spanish ] [ screaming in Spanish ] - He just keeps saying "aliens," that they angered them, and how they'’re gonna destroy us. - Maybe he means aliens like foreigners, like a third party. Ask him, are there Russian contractors that are busting in here or something? - You guys getting this? - [ wounded man continues in Spanish] - Ah, yeah, I'’m hearing it loud and clear. Just try to get some more intel on who the aggressor was. We'’ve gotta figure out what the hell we'’re dealing with. Over. [ speaking Spanish] [ Spanish] - Whoa, what are you talking about? What did he say? - He said that we'’re gonna find our death here, and we can'’t hope to fight this evil. - Have him shut the hell up and stop giving away our position or I'’m gonna put a bullet in his ass. [ shouting, arguing ] - Hey! - Shut him up! Shut up! - Easy, easy, easy. - I can'’t believe-- - It had to-- - It had to be done. - Because he needed to. He was giving our position away. Right, Faulk? - No, not really. - Had to be done. - We gotta keep moving. - Come on. - Commander? - Well-- - What are we looking at, squad? - Some sort of tech ball-- an oversized marble. Back up. - Yo, pick it up. - Yo, what are you doing? - I'’m just seeing-- - Be careful, now, be careful. Could be attached to a bomb. - That ain'’t no damn mine. Do it, Malloy! [ chuckles ] Shit. - Malloy, you'’re a fucking maniac. - Yeah, well, your mama wasn'’t complaining last night. - Real nice, Malloy. - Fuck you. - Hold it up, if you would, just so I can get a reading. - Put that shit down. - I mean, are you sure this thing ain'’t radioactive? - No, I don'’t think-- - Malloy, Malloy, Malloy. [ gasping ]Hey, Malloy! - It'’s going up my arm! - We need to get him back-- - Drop it! - I can'’t! It'’s in my arm! - It'’s in my arm! It'’s in my arm! - Don'’t move. - Brooks! Brooks! - [ screaming ] - No! - Get back. Back, back, back, back. - Keep it together. Keep it together, goddammit. [ laser fire ] - Brooks, get your ass in gear! Commander, I don'’t see where the fire is coming from. Do you have eyes on the hostiles? - Negative, Faulk. I can'’t see over here. - You good? Good? - Yeah. - What'’s the status? - We found residue-- traces of the SEAL team. And that ball Malloy found, it wasn'’t connected to a mine, but it was dangerous all the same. It-It went inside him, somehow. - Inside him? - I-- it just sank into him. It just permeated right through his skin. I--I know how it sounds, but-- - No, it'’s just like he said. It just, bloop, right into his skin, and then-- - Kablooey. - From the inside out. Whatever that shit was, man, it just went into his skin. It just fucking blew him apart, man. - I--I think it might have been some sort of mine or a perimeter device. Anyway, but when that thing blew Malloy apart, we started catching fire. I don'’t know where from, though. - Maybe-- Maybe from the building. - Yeah, most likely. There'’s not a lot of vantage points, so maybe on the other side of the jungle. - Doubtful. Bad angle. Way too far. - Tech that went inside his skin? - Yes. - That doesn'’t make any sense. - That'’s exactly what happened. - What'’s the plan, Cap? - The plan'’s still the plan. We need to find out what happened to that plane, and we need to find out what the hell happened to the SEAL team. - I say we call an air strike, so they can bomb the fuck out of this jungle. - Yeah, me too, Plante, but unfortunately, this is all we got. - What? - We shouldn'’t even be out here, all right? What we'’re gonna get-- We'’ll be out of here in two hours, and that'’s for extraction. This is all we'’re gonna got. - Damn it, how are we supposed to approach if they can hit us with something that heavy-- hit from that far away? - Yeah, perhaps there'’s a blind side on the other side of the building, maybe where the aircraft crashed? - It may have blocked their line of sight. - Yeah. Here'’s our approach. We'’re gonna move to that side of the treeline. We'’ll stay as tight as possible through the jungle for as long as we can, till we get to what we hope is the blind side of that building. And no more tripping any damn alarms. We can'’t afford any more of that. I'’m gonna keep as many of you alive as possible, all right? But you gotta do the same. You gotta be smart. You gotta keep watching each other'’s backs. And you shoot to kill anything that is not us. Let'’s kill these sons of bitches. Yeah? Brooks. - Yes, sir? - That explosive that you saw down there-- Was it compact, and it permeated in his skin? - Mm-hmm. - Who do you think would be supplying that? - Oh, you mean like an unknown ally or something? - Or maybe even someone on the side? A contractor, mercenary? And you never seen nothing like this before? In development? - If they are, I haven'’t heard a peep about it, sir. I mean, but there'’s very few countries that are even close to something like that. - A few countries like who? - Well, us, Russia, Israel, South Korea, Japan, India. Maybe China or Germany, but I'’m telling you, sir, any one of those would be a long shot, just-- - Well, just humor me. If you had to take a guess? - Well, Israel doesn'’t really make any sense, both politically and technologically. - Right, right. - They'’re researching ballistics, not nanotechnology. - Mm-hmm. - If I had to take a guess, I'’d say Russia. I mean, they'’re the farthest along when it comes to compound explosives. - So you'’re saying there might be an alliance between Russia we know nothing about, with technology that shouldn'’t exist, way out here in the jungle? - I mean, I guess it'’s possible. It'’s not likely, sir, but-- - That'’s what we got to go on right now, right? - Sure. - Carter. Take point. - Copy that. - How you holding up? - I'’m okay, sir. A little better now I'’ve had a second to focus on anything else. - Look, you are an important part of this mission. You know that, right? Just keep your mind right. You block all that shit out, it doesn'’t matter. - Yeah, I'’ll do my best, sir. - What you got in the goodie bag over there? - Perks of working at advanced tech division, I guess. - Anything I haven'’t seen before? - I thought you'’ve seen everything? - Well, yeah. - I got these babies right here-- built-in spectrum analyzer, infrared, night vision, all in this one pair of goggles. I got stuff more your speed, too-- flash bombs, handheld rocket launcher, compound explosives. I mean, if you need to make noise today, sir, I got you. - Good. Let'’s move out. - Yes, sir. - Brooks. Eyes. What do you see? - It seems clear, as best as I can tell, sir. - If they'’ve got high ground, this is our best possible angle. They won'’t get a clear shot from the roof. - I'’m just checking--yeah. This is almost exactly where the distress call came from. Four body monitors went dead about 100 yards around the perimeter, and the last body monitor went dead around there a minute later. - All right. - No bodies. Not just no bodies-- no anything. Does it look like a firefight took place to anyone else here? - Not even a little. - What the hell does it mean if they take the bodies? Why would they take the bodies and clean it all up? - Someone who doesn'’t wanna be found, maybe. - No, it'’s somebody who knew we would fucking be here. It'’s freaking me out. - Yeah, same here. - Let'’s take it slow. Do not bunch up. Keep fanned out at all times, and do not pick up anything that you did not bring with you. - Copy that? - Copy. - Copy. - All right, let'’s move. - I do not like this at all. - Ho, ho, ho, hold up, hold up. - It'’s just some weird insurgent graffiti. - No, that'’s not the local language, Plante. - So they'’re creative with their tags, so what? - Just consider for a second it might be a warning. - Yeah, so was blowing up Malloy. - Hey, Cap. Brooks here wants to call this mission on the account of some weird insurgent hieroglyphic shit. - Brooks. You getting something? - I-I mean, I think so. There'’s just these weird green energy signatures everywhere. - What do you mean? - It'’s this weird distortion. It'’s not on any visual spectrum that I know, I-- - What do you mean? - Hold on a second. Fuck. - What are you seeing? - There'’s blood-- there'’s lots of blood. It'’s everywhere. They'’ve wiped it clean, but there'’s traces under this UVA light. - How do you wipe dirt to clean of blood? - Well, that'’s not just it-- there'’s these green energy signatures here, but they'’re not on any visual spectrum that I'’ve seen before. I don'’t know what it is, that'’s what I'’m telling you. - Radiation, right? - No, radiation doesn'’t make the fine tracks like this. There'’s this shit-- There'’s this. - What the hell is that? - I don'’t know, but it'’s the same shit that I saw blow Malloy apart. It'’s the same stuff I saw when Buckner was cut down. When I look at it through this UVA light, it'’s lit up like a Christmas tree, and this is those same green energy distortions. - It looks like the same sort of rock that impaled the enemy soldier. - Right. - Rocks? Y'’all talking about rocks? This whole goddamn jungle'’s full of rocks. You wanna see more rock fields? My collection'’s here. - Everybody just keep an eye open. We'’re still on the clock, all right? All right, that'’s it. - Ready to light this bitch up, boss? - Absolutely, let'’s lock and load. We'’re gonna make our ingress through that entry right there. Sklaroff, you need a post up right here. Hold six down. If you get any fire at all, you light that ass up fast. - With pleasure, sir. - If we'’re not back in two hours for the extraction, I want you to go ahead and push south, meet up with the chopper. - But, Commander-- - Meet. That'’s a direct order. - Sir, yes, sir. - All right. Time to mount up. Let'’s lock and load. [ suspenseful music ] - Clear! - Clear! - Clear! - Clear! - Get it back open, we need an escape route. - Radio Sklaroff, we need a back door. - [ Woman ] Sklaroff. Sklaroff, can you hear me? We'’re sealed in all of a sudden. Over. - I have no earthly idea. I heard those thuds, and then the-- the entrance just wasn'’t there anymore. Over. - [ lasers fire ] - I'’m under attack! They'’re everywhere! - Calm down. Hold your water, now, hold your water. - Sklaroff. SIT REP. Over. - Ahhhh! - I say again, what'’s your 20? Over. - What'’s he say? - I got nothing. - Hell with it--get back. [ grunting ] - Stand down, Plante, stand back, goddammit! - Carter, you okay? - I'’ll live. - Easy, easy, easy. - Dammit. - What do we got here, what do we got? All right, it went straight through, you'’ll be okay. Can you move your arm? - Yeah. Doesn'’t feel like a party, but I can use it. - All right. - Brooks, give me your bandana for a tourniquet. - Brooks! - Not smart, at all. - I was just trying to shoot down the door. You just got your own goddamn man shot. You'’re making a bunch of-- you'’re making a bunch of noise. That fucking thing'’s not gonna make a dent anyways. Less ruckus, okay? Less ruckus. - Got it. - Okay. - Cap, can we hurry this up? - I got you, I got you. I know you hate being sealed in, right? We still got one way out-- the big-ass hole in the side of the building. We are good, we are good. - And that big-ass mystery bird that caused it. - Exactly, you'’re damn right. Look, the plan has not changed. It hasn'’t changed at all, okay? Keep your eyes peeled for any traps. Copy? - Copy. - Copy that. - All right, stay frosty. - Faulk, Brooks, you'’re with Carter. Head that way. Plante and Alvarez, we'’re gonna shoot to the right. If you hear anything at all, radio, radio, radio, we will be there. - Copy that? - Copy. - All right. - This shit ain'’t adding up. - Eyes up, watch your six. - This place is bigger than it should be. Think about it, Sarge. - He'’s not wrong. - That room should be on the outside. - Uh-huh. - This is not good, boss. - Just try to keep it out of your mind. - This place is creeping me the hell out. The sooner we get outta here, the better. - Agreed. - Look, I hate cramped spaces, I hate the dark, I hate being sealed in. This place has the trifecta. So believe me when I say nobody wants to get outta here as bad as I do. But for now, let'’s just focus on the task at hand. - Room'’s clear. Over. - Copy that. Proceed ahead with caution. Over. - Let'’s move out. [ mechanical pulsing ] - From cave to green-ass vegetation. This is not normal. - Cap--I don'’t like this at all. - Hey, you know that... that feeling in your chest right before shit is about to get real? - Copy. - Yeah, me too. - How'’s our six looking? - It'’s clear, sir. - Nothing? Ah, we'’ll figure it out here then - Shit! What the fuck is this? - Carter? We found it. What the fuck? I'’ve never seen anything like this before Team. [ clears throat ] All hands on deck, all hands on deck. Do an upstairs sweep of the area and head our way. If you got anything, radio quick. Over. - Check. That hole. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Eh... looked that way yesterday, but-- Shit. We ain'’t getting through that way. - I was afraid of that. - Fuck. - All right, just keep your eyes open for another way out. This is a no-go. [ mechanical pulsing ] - I think we found the reason why the lights are all still on, sir. - What you got? - Well, I'’m not-- I'’m not sure just yet. - All right, well, keep searching, then. - Yes, sir. - Faulk, you okay? - Yes, sir. Just tense, I guess. - All hands on deck, all hands on deck. Over. - All right, you heard Adrien. Let'’s clear this last room and head back. - Just allow us a minute, Sarge? You remember those green energy signatures? - Yeah, you got more of them? - Yep. But it'’s not just that. These are vibrant. These look like they were just made or perhaps maybe they'’re still being made. - [ retching, grunting ] - What does that mean? - [ coughing, choking ] - Faulk? Faulk! Take it back, take it back, take it back. - [ gasping, choking ] - Just take a seat. Whoa, Faulk, Faulk! Take a seat! - Faulk! What is wrong with you? Faulk, take a seat! - Faulk, Faulk Faulk! - Ready for entry. - Cap, do you copy? Over! - Faulk! Faulk, take a seat. - [ choking ] - Faulk--Faulk! Faulk! - Brooks, she'’s gone! - Fuck, she'’s dead! She'’s dead! - She'’s dead. - Aw, fuck! - All right, eyes up, circle up. - Sarge, you can'’t just leave her here. She'’s dead-- you can'’t just-- - Brooks, she'’s gone. We gotta go. - Okay. - Come on. - Okay. Okay. - Cap. Faulk is down. We'’re preparing to engage. Over. Adrian: Carter hold on. Carter. - Cap! - I think it'’s Hobbs. - Thank god! We'’ve come a long way to find you. - Hobbs, hang in there buddy. - Cap. - Shit. All right, all right. - This guy'’s barely got a pulse. - No-- - Shh, you all right? You still with us? - No--no, no, no. - Stay up, Plante, stay up. - No, you gotta get outta here. They'’re not-- No, they'’re not-- - Shh-- - They'’re not human. - You'’re not listening to me. Save yourselves. Run! - Easy, easy now... - No. - What did he mean? - Fuck! - What did he mean by that? - I don'’t know. - They'’re not human? - Let'’s go. Let'’s go. - Steady, Brooks, steady. - Okay. - Okay? We gotta keep moving, come on. You see anything? - No sir, nothing. - We'’ll reverse back down. - Copy. - Regroup with the others. Stay close. - Copy. - I don'’t want-- Sarge? Sarge? - I don'’t want anything-- - Sarge! - To happen. - Carter! Carter! [ laser fire ] [ gasping ] - Ship appears to be about 40 to 50 feet tall, twice as wide in the wingspan, hull as thick as hell-- couple of feet, probably. How does this thing fly? - Cap! Cap! - Brooks! - We'’re under attack! Sergeant Carter and Faulk are down. I tried to reach you guys, but the radios were scrambled. - Where is Faulk? Where is Faulk? - Yeah, the--the-- I'’m sorry, Alvarez, there'’s nothing we could do. I tried to help her. - Who engaged? Who engaged, buddy? - Enemy troops, all black armor, in bulletproof vests. I tried--I tried to hit them from point-blank range, they wouldn'’t even nudge. [ panting ] [ whirring ] - Oh! It'’s them! - Identify yourself! - Take cover! Go! Go! Go! Go! Take cover, take cover! - They'’re surrounding us! - All right... - Brooks... - You shook, Brooks? - Hell, yeah. - Is this-- is this what you saw? - This is them, yes, sir. This is them. - Okay. [ weapons fire ] Follow the ship! Follow the ship! - We might be headed into an ambush! - Follow the ship! - Cap, you can'’t be serious! - Fall in, fall in, fall in! - You wouldn'’t go for Buckner but you wanna take this damn thing? - Move your ass! - Clear! Clear! Clear! Clear! - Ready? On three, on three-- one, two, three. - All right - We actually got a couple minutes but let'’s be quick in here. We got no idea what they'’re planning outside. - Or in here. - You bet your ass. Let'’s go ahead and check for hostile before we get overrun. - Whatever armor these guys have, I'’ve never heard or seen anything like it before. What about you, Brooks? You'’re the tech guy. - No. Body armor that doesn'’t leave traces of being hit? It doesn'’t exist. I saw you hit this thing from yards away with .50 cal, Lieutenant Colonel. Cloth-covered body armor, you can maybe pretend like there isn'’t a scratch, but this is--I mean-- - Cap. - Do you have any intel, any reports whatsoever, about the prisoners-- - None. - having any type of technology like this? Anything--anything at all? - Sir, none whatsoever. - We gotta figure out what the hell we'’re dealing with. Alvarez, I need a hand. [ grunting ] - Shit! - That'’s--that'’s-- - It'’s not human. - Neither is the rest of the ship. And the armor and the weapons--none of this is... Team, we'’ve had no idea how important this mission really is. Brooks, document this. - Okay. - What'’s that shit on its face, like the metal stuff? - It'’s cybernetic components. You see the wires going down into the armor? Cap, it looks like these things augmented themselves, or they'’ve been augmented, anyway. - They did it to themselves. - It augments their-- it augments their senses, maybe. At this point, your guess is as good as mine. - Your guess? Guess? That'’s not what you were saying when you said that we should get in this goddamn spaceship. - Plante-- - No, no, I'’m sick of this shit, Cap. Why does this spaz get to call the shots, huh? Why do you trust him more than you trust me or Alvarez? - If he hadn'’t taken the most lucky shot of all time, that thing would still be firing at us. - How do we even know this damn thing is dead? - [ grunting ] - Yep, dead. - Thanks, Mom. - All right, we need to hustle up and scout the rest of the ship. Front of the ship turns into a ramp, allowing us to make ingress. Hull is dimly lit. Appears to be a warship of some kind, which contained hostiles. Hostile is wearing black armor, possibly the same material ship is made out of. Bullets are completely useless against it. Hostiles appear to be extraterrestrial in origin, as does the rest of the ship. Their weapons system is far beyond anything we'’ve ever seen. Small, marble-sized explosives, weapons system capable of firing energy bullets and projectile blades. And I got a feeling that'’s just the tip of the iceberg. - I gotta be honest with you, Cap--I'’m freaking out. I mean, maybe we shouldn'’t have come at all. All we'’ve done is get more men killed. - Commander? - Yep? - I'’m checking out the heat and energy spectrum aboard this ship. Those--those green energy signatures? I'’m seeing the same thing on board the ship that we saw upstairs inside this building. It'’s--it'’s everywhere. I can'’t--it'’s so dense, I can'’t see anything-- - So you'’re saying that the energy or the radiation--what-- whatever it is, it'’s coming from this thing? - Yeah, that--I mean, that'’s what it seems like. Maybe aboard this ship, that spectrum is a way to tell where these things are, but-- - This dude got some big-ass eyes, man. Shit, I'’d probably wear a helmet and a face mask too if I was this damn ugly. - Oh, and the tentacles don'’t bother you? - Nah. I'’ve been on some weird dates. - So we found the ship, and we'’re on the ship. Please tell me you got a plan, Cap. - The only plan right now is to go ahead with scouting the rest of the ship out and find something we can use. - Cap, I see something we can use. - Come on, Plante. - No-- - Remember the last time we tried something? - No, no, no-- - Remember what happened? - I'’m just going through all the options that we have right now. Frankly, they'’re pretty goddamn limited, from what I can see. - I hate to admit it, but Plante is right. - No, absolutely not. - Even if we had them outnumbered, they clearly have the upper hand, because they have the more advanced weaponry. And oh, yeah--we'’re stuck on their goddamn spaceship, where lord knows how many of them out there or even in here. - And there--there'’s no way of knowing if we can find the front door and get out. - See? Alvarez gets it-- again, thanks, Brooksie. - Plante, enough. Just everybody, calm down, be cool. Listen, we need to scout out the rest of the ship, all right? We'’re gonna stay together the whole time. Keep your eyes peeled for anything and everything that could be of use to get us out of here in one piece. - Cap, we need that weapon. - No, absolutely not. - Anything to get the advantage, right? - Yes, normally, absolutely-- yes, you'’re right. But given the circumstances, the last time one of us picked up one of those alien weapons, he blew up. - Desperate measures, Cap-- you taught us that. - Alvarez, I'’ve also taught you to be smart. - Cap, it'’s smart to at least try. - We don'’t touch anything unless absolutely necessary. - Alvarez, you with me? - Shoot these motherfuckers with their own BFGs? I think that'’s a great idea. - Absolutely not. Alvarez, do not touch-- - [ grunting ] Jesus. This thing weighs a ton. - Alvarez, put it down. - I'’m just gonna shoot a round into the ground--simple. - Alvarez, put that thing down right now until we figure out what the hell we'’re doing with this-- - Alvarez, I got your back. - Plante, you don'’t have-- - Screw that, Alvarez, fire that shit up. - What--put it-- Plante-- [ laser fires ] - Ahhh! - Alvarez--Alvarez, put it down! - Alvarez! - Ahhh! - Drop it, put it down! Drop it! - Ahhhh! - Shit! [ screaming ] - Oh, fuck! - Shit. - You did this! You did this! You piece of shit! - Cap, it'’s okay... We got Plante, we gotta go. Go, go. - Move, move. Stay close, the hallway'’s breaking! - Clear! - Clear! - Captain? Captain! Captain! Plante! - Brooks--where the fuck is Brooks at? - Shit, I swear I just saw him right behind me in the corridor a second ago. - Brooks? - I mean, I didn'’t see any movement in between us-- I swear I would have saw if there was movement. Fucking idiot must have taken the wrong turn. - Brooks, if you hear us, say something. - It'’s just us two against these things now. - Brooks. Three if we can count Brooks. Brooks, do you copy? Over. [ static ] Fuck! Shit! [ roaring ] - That'’s why they crashed. [ clatter ] - Footsteps. Be quiet, 13th opposition. It'’s coming! - Oh! Oh, it'’s me! Plante, it'’s me, stand down. It'’s me! Jesus. - Oh, Christ, you almost got your face blown in three different showers. - Cap, you gotta see this. - Quickly. Plante, hold the door. - I don'’t think that'’s one of the troopers we were trading with. He looks like an engineer or-- someone who was working on the ship. Everything indicates that they crash-landed here, right? And there was something wrong with those panels he was working on. Look at this--there'’s a white bracket, red bracket. I-I don'’t know what this white bracket is; maybe that'’s their destination, where they'’re headed. But this red bracket-- I'’m almost positive that'’s the Milky Way. Th-That looks like the Milky Way, and that'’s where they crash-landed. - You sure? - Way, way off-course. - Positive? - If I'’m right, yes. Anyway... - Maybe they didn'’t come here to wage war or do anything sinister like that. - What about all those American soldiers that they slaughtered? I call that pretty damn sinister, wouldn'’t you? - Well, there'’s something else I gotta show you, Commander. - Brooks, we ain'’t got all day. - I lit off a flash bomb upstairs, in the building-- that'’s the only time I'’ve seen one of these things give pause. Which had me thinking, what'’s the one constant in this entire ship and in the surrounding building? It'’s dark. It'’s low light. They have compound eyes. They can'’t see anything. I took a flash pic of the thing without the helmet, he reeled back like it was almost hurt or something. - So then we can use these to disorient them. - Yeah, well, what I'’m hoping is we can maybe surround them and keep letting off these flash bombs, and let off another one every time it starts getting its bearings again. - All right. - Well, and that'’s the-- that'’s the problem, Plante. Obviously, we-we'’re gonna have to get up close, try to find seams in their armor, which means we have to engage up close. - Flash bombs. We need real explosives, not some flash bombs. - Well, on that last point, I picked up their explosive-- those marble things that blew Malloy apart. - Now that'’s what the fuck I'’m talking about. - All right, chances are we'’re only gonna get one shot at this, so we gotta make it count. It was an honor and a privilege serving alongside both of you. - I don'’t like it. - That'’s the plan, Plante. - Why? Because this jerkoff says so? I'’m not coming along with that plan. All-out assault is how we'’re doing this. That chopper will be here in 15 minutes. We gotta move. - Plante! - Ahhh! - Plante! Plante! Fuck! Eyes! - Eyes! - Those are working, Cap. - What are you doing? Brooks! Brooks! Brooks, get out of there! Brooks! Brooks! Get out of there! Brooks! - Shit. [ gasping ] - Ahhhhh! Let'’s go--move your ass. Come on, let'’s go! Move your ass, let'’s go! [ weapons fire ] - Cap! Cap, no, no, no, come on. Cap, what'’s wrong? Are you hit? Goddammit--damn it, damn it, damn it, fuck. - I need you to be calm. Damn. - Sir, you-- - I know. - You'’re-- - It'’s bad. - Okay. Okay. I'’ll find... maybe I can bandage you up. - I think I'’m well past first aid at this point. - Huh? - I think I'’m first aid at this point. When those fuckers... pop out again... I'’ll throw myself at them, give you time. If anyone'’s got a good enough chance of getting out of here, it'’s gotta be you, I figure, right? - I think I-I might have one plan, sir, but it'’s-- but it'’s a long shot. - Sometimes they'’re the best ones, Brooks. - Sir, just let me fight with you. My nerves are gone, I promise. You know how long I'’ve been training hand-to-hand-- - You know that'’s not gonna get you outta here, Brooks. It'’s not gonna get your ass outta here. Look, you'’re getting outta here, okay? And I wanna give you enough time to do so. When you get back to HQ-- - Yes, sir. - I want you to give them this. When you get back to HQ-- - Uh-huh? - You give that to them, along with your photos Get everything in it, okay? Okay? Just like it'’s supposed to be. - You make a big bang yourself, Lieutenant Colonel. - Go! You bet your ass. You bet your ass. - Come on, motherfucker! Come on, bitch! Motherfucker! - Fuck, fuck. Fuck, you don'’t breathe, do you? Just like you said, Commander. Full force. You crash-landed here. I knew you did. We just fired on you first, but you were just trying to fix your ship. And the warnings outside, I saw them. I--I--I knew-- I ignored them. You killed all those men, though. You killed my commander. And with our first unit and then us, obviously you thought we just wanted war. Which means that it'’s the two of us, then. So we'’re either gonna fight or call a truce, and I got nothing left to fight you with. I couldn'’t even fight you if I could. [ mechanical whirring ] Good luck. [ music ] Hey! Hey! I'’m here! I'’m here! I'’m here-- [ aircraft engines ] I'’m here, I'’m here! [ panting ] I'’m here. ♪
