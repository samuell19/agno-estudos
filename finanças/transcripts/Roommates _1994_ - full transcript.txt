(majestic music) (seagulls calling) (waves rumbling) (classical piano music) - My fingers just don't seem to get the message anymore. - That's just temporary, Bill. - No, Mom. Teeth, hair, 20/20 vision, breath to run up three flights of stairs, those are temporary. - Sweetheart, please, won't you change your mind and stay? - (chuckling) We've been through this, it's not what I want. Now, I'll see you on Thanksgiving, I'll speak to you often, all right? If Millard calls, will you tell him that I tried to reach him? - Of course. - How is he, have you heard? - No. - You're not exactly a charity case, you know, there's no need to move clear across the country into some halfway house in Seattle crowded with sick people. - Well, I'm quite lucky, actually. I can't work, but I feel useful. It's a place that I need where I feel needed, okay? - Bill, Barbara's right. If, if it's a matter of money- - Thanks, but I figure from kindergarten through six years of college, I'm already overdrawn. - (chuckling) Well, nevermind that. If things get too bad- - Well, you know what they say? You never know until you're there. Goodbye. - Here, let me help you with those. - Thanks. - I remember when your Uncle Phil bought these pieces- - Oh, yes. for a trip to Spain. - My inheritance. - Been all over the world, these pieces. Your Uncle Phil, he was something else. - Yes, Uncle Phil was a $3 bill, right? - Oh, God, what's in here, bricks? - Books. (Barbara laughing) - Teaching you to read, that was my first mistake. - Older sisters are a form of punishment, you know that? - Hah. (glass banging) (TV referee whistles tweeting) - [Barney] Oh, all right, forget about it. - No, you've been doing this to me for 30 years. First you tell me there's a snake in my boot and then you say forget I said anything. You know, I really needed this. (faint jukebox music) (TV football murmuring) - Should you be drinking? (glass thumping) - I shouldn't be breathing. - I'm not talking about your health, I'm talking about your parole officer. - He thinks I shouldn't be breathing, either. - Four years you were inside. I keep telling people, "Bum rap, they picked the wrong Irishman out of the lineup." Now this. - Yeah, bum rap. (breath exhaling) Jim Reilly, the greatest lover in the whole neighborhood has got AIDS! Bad rap. - Hey, do you mind? You wanna empty out the place? (faint jukebox music) - I spend half my time now trying to convince people you aren't a fag. - And the other half wondering, right? - Mickey, when he asked me where you been, I gotta tell him. You moved into that convent with a bunch of queers! - Oh, so that's the reason he ain't been around. - What do you expect? Moving in with a bunch of fags, nobody's gonna be around. - I don't really care. The rents right and I got the place all to myself. They got nine queers, two hookers and a junkie, nobody bothers me. (laughing) Ain't about to move no fruitcake in with me. (laughing) (glass clinking) (faint jukebox music) (TV football fans cheering) - Jimmy, are you okay? What does the doctor say? - He says I'm right, they're headaches. (bar stool scrapping) Oh. (cigarette pack rustling) - I'll see ya, Logan. (jukebox music) (feet shuffling) (beer glass shattering) - All right, let it be. Look here, come on, Jim! Come on, now, cut it out! (jukebox music) - Gimme a glass of water, Logan. (water gurgling) (glass thumping) To your health. (jukebox music) (glasses clinking) You better break those, too. - What's the matter with you! (glass shattering) You got no right to treat Logan like that! I still like to come in here once in a while! - Yeah, well, do me a favor, go back there and tell Logan I'm adopted! There's no reason you shouldn't still be allowed in this toilet! (door squeaking) (jukebox music) - Hey, Jimmy, where ya going? (car rumbling) (car humming) (car horn blaring) - Ah, quit blowing you're diddy bag! - Oh, damn, damn, wait! (car horn honking) - [Car Driver] Watch it, lady! (car horn blaring) - Oh, wait, oh, my God! I'm glad you don't have a driver's license. - It's the pill, I took it. - Yeah, well, the pill has a faint smell of beer. - Oh. (laughing) You noticed that, too, huh? (traffic humming) - I just got a couple of job listings you might be interested in. It wouldn't hurt you- - Oh. (groaning) - To try and pay some rent, you know. - Don't you ever give up. (police siren wailing) - An electronics warehouse needs an inventory control man. - Oh, great. First VCR that turns up missing, guess who gets to wear handcuffs? - Well, a print shop needs a compositor. - I'm too old, those places are all into computers nowadays. - Oh no, this is a letterpress shop. (laughing) Oh, Eldon, ah, (throat clearing) the clinic van will be swinging by here Monday, Wednesdays and Saturday mornings. - Thank God. - Gee, Eldon, you finally get to rest your little wings. Woo-oo, Eldon, woo! (laughing) - He doesn't belong here. - You have to know how to take him. - How? Half stewed most of the time, TV blaring all night and then he's got the nerve to try to borrow pain pills. Enough is enough, and I'm not the only one. - Things may be about to change, Eldon. Give it a chance. Hi, Norma. Okay, what about the print shop? - Have a lovely evening, Eldon. - C'mon, what about the print shop? - Actually, I'm thinking of entering the priesthood. Hm? - Oh, that's good, good priest. Come on, in. Hup, 2-3-4! - Come on in. (feet shuffling) - Jim, you keep this place looking like a swap meet. - Yeah? (TV basketball game murmuring) What can I interest you in, huh? Ball cap, one size fits all. Oh, it's you. - Do you remember what I told you last week? - What? (TV basketball game murmuring) Hey, come on, line, it's a foul! He was going for the basket. Hey, Lisa, don't do that. Hey, Lisa! (TV referees whistling) Come on, administrators don't do maid's work! - Uh! - Come on, you're trying to shame me, huh? All right, it worked. - Good! Then do me a favor, try and keep this apartment halfway sanitary, you're about to have a roommate. - What? No, you can't do this to me. - Yes, I can. I'm not a maid, I'm the administrator and I told you about this a week ago. - This, this is not going to happen. - It's happened and don't sound like I'm asking you for a favor. This is something you've needed, Jim. - You're asking for bloodshed! You ready for that, huh? (luggage thumping) There's no way I'm gonna share this place with some damn fairy! (Lisa throat clearing) - Jim Reilly, this is Bill Thomas. Um, in the last year Bill has been helping us addressing civic and professional groups on the ramifications of AIDS. - Well, I think that's just wonderful! - Other than that, I think people should say what they want about themselves, right? - All right, I'll go first. I'm an ex-con on parole for bank robbery. - Well, I certainly can't top that. - Look, we might as well get something straight up front. I ain't no fag. I got AIDS from a blood transfusion and I don't really care what kinda crap you hand 'em at those civic and professional groups. It is my firm conviction that AIDS is God's way of cleaning house, including me, pal. It's God's way of cleaning house. - Well, I see even God doesn't do windows. - That's good, you've opened up lines of communication. I'll check in on you tomorrow. You look tired. - We'll speak tomorrow. (TV basketball murmuring) Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. (door knocking) - Hi, is there a William Thomas here? - Yes, that's me. - Where do you want this stuff? - Right in there, the little room with all the noise. I took the big one in back. First come, first serve, right? - Well, it's exactly what I would've done. (luggage thumping) Of course, I have a selfish nature. Thank you. (door slamming) (TV basketball game murmuring) - I can tell you right now, there ain't gonna be no gay rights parades in and outta here! You hear me? - How could I not. - [Jim] Ya hear me? - Quite clearly. - Good! (TV basketball game murmuring) Quite clearly. And don't expect the world to stop around here, either, just because you decide to go night-night. You like basketball? (quiet piano music) - Not really. - [Jim] Football? - Nope. - [Jim] No baseball either, right? - Right. - [Jim] Golf, I suppose. - Tennis. - [Jim] Well, if you plan on sticking around, you better get your own TV. I don't watch much tennis. (Bill sighing) (garbage truck rumbling) Mm, ah. (sighing) Uh. Ah. (garbage truck rumbling) Yo, you up! All right, reveille, rise and shine! Here's how it goes. Number one, don't wake up all bright and cheerful and expect a lotta conversation because I don't do much talking before noon. Number two, if you see any of my stuff lying around, don't do me any favors by putting 'em away 'cause it's hands off private property around here. Number three, hey, you gettin' all this? You hear me? (foot stomping) All right, look, if you're still a little put out 'cause I was kinda rough on ya last night, don't be. I get these headaches, see, and well, when I do, I'm just warning ya, stay the hell outta my way. Fair enough? (door squeaking) (door slamming) - [Receptionist] Thank you for calling, Seattle AIDS Alliance, can I help you? - It was a rather disastrous first night in the apartment. - What happened? - I'm going to move out. - You just moved in yesterday. - I know, I know, but look, (door clicking) you can call it snobbery but I call it self preservation. I just don't think that it's fair to him or to me. The vibe is just too awful and I can still get my old apartment back if I hurry and maybe you'll have another opening before too long, right? - Look, I've got a problem with Jim. Nobody really wants to room with him or even have him there. - That doesn't really stun me. - It's a protective coloration he puts on. - Yes, it's quite effective, too. - I thought if anyone could get behind it, it would be you. He really needs the help. - Ah, you overestimate me. (hand slapping) - No, I don't. You see, I think you need him, too. - One more time? - I've watched you, when you speak about straights with AIDS, there's an edge to your voice. It's, it's like a bitterness that maybe you're glad that this terrible thing seeped over to the other side of the fence. - (sighing) That's a, that's a horrible thing to say. (door clicking) - [Receptionist] Sir, sir- - Yeah, just like I thought! - Sir, you can't go in there! (door slamming) You couldn't wait to get your heads together to find a way to put old Jim out in a dumpster! - Hold it. - No, you hold it! You think just because I'm living there on a temporarily rent free basis, you can just waltz in there with a wad of bucks in your pocket- - Oh, please. - And take the place over for yourself! Well, no way, Billy boy- - When you get through- - No way! - Frothing at the mouth, will you just open your ears and listen for a minute. There is no way I'm spending two consecutive days under the same roof as some John Dillinger wanna be! - Good, because I don't wanna- - Stop it, stop it! Stop it, stop it, both of you! I am not the reservation clerk at the Ritz! That is a two bedroom apartment, and I've got a waiting list from here to the ocean of people who wish they were so lucky. Now, either you both give it a try or you can both take a walk. Take it or leave it right now. (distant police siren wailing) - (sighing) All right, Lisa, in the spirit of fairness, I was thinking that I should allow Jim to be a little bit closer to his beloved television set by giving him the smaller front bedroom. - No! (hand slamming) N-O! - [Bill] Why not? - Because as I was there first, that's why not. - Oh, very mature. Very mature. - Listen, you, you ever been away? Huh, you ever done time? - Ah, what does that have to do with anything? - Because if you had you'd know, in stir you don't just walk in, you gotta earn your place, Billy! - Yeah, well, we're not in stir, Jimmy. - Aw, screw this, I can't talk to this guy! - Forget about this, Lisa. - Why, why don't we flip a coin to see who gets the front bedroom? - Because it's my bedroom! - Just drop it, okay? - Think how smug you'll feel when you win. (Bill sighing) - (sighing) You gotta coin? - I've got a coin. (traffic rumbling) - You know, actually, I'm gonna like it up there in that little front room. (luggage wheels rumbling) I haven't been sleeping worth a hoot back here. Oh, when I was in stir one of the things I missed most were the sounds, you know, the traffic noises. That's the kinda music I can go to sleep by. - I'm happy to oblige a fellow music lover. - Ah, so, ah, what kind of degree did you say you had? - Master's degree. - Mm, Master of what? - Government policy. Actually, I help groups and individuals apply for government grants. - Oh. You and me, we're in the same line of work, stealing from the public. Mr. Neat. - That's right. I also hang my shirts with their collars buttoned. - Hey, your secret's safe with me. (blankets thumping) Hm? Oh, it was a knife fight three years ago. The other guy had the knife. - Oh. - When they were sewing me back up, I had an out of body experience. Yeah, it's like I, I came out of my body and I hovered over them and I could see 'em working on me and I heard this voice say, "Not yet, Jim, not yet" and then I floated back down to, what, you don't believe me? - Ah, I believe that you believe it. (bag rattling) It's the best that I can do. - Well, it happened. - Sure it did. You know how to work one of these? - What's to know? I hate those things. - What's the matter? - Oh, the jackhammers are starting again. - Do you have any pills for that? - Yeah, I got one. I don't wanna take it till I'm dying! Lisa, she hides the rest of 'em for me. When it gets too bad, I call her and she tells me where to find one. (laughing) She's got the map to Treasure Island. - Why don't you take one now? - No, sometimes it goes away. (sighing) Oh, God! (telephone beeping) Oh! (sighing) Mm. What about you, Billy? What's lowered you to this station in life? (hand thumping) That pneumonia stuff, huh? - Yeah, I've been taking aerosolized pentamidine trying to keep it from coming back. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. - Well, look on the bright side, at least you can pronounce it. - Don't they know what's causing your headaches? - I don't wanna know. Talking about illness makes people sick. Let's go, let's get outta here. (traffic rumbling) (shoppers murmuring) - What's in here. There's enough salt in this to start your own ocean. - Man does not live by cauliflower alone. (traffic rumbling) - [Male Shopper] Look at that, some horseradish. - [Female Shopper] Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. (traffic rumbling) (shoppers murmuring) - Hey, Mickey! - Hey, Jim. Hey, how you been? - Well, pick up a phone and find out. - Yeah, well, you know. - Yeah, I know. You're getting a belly! (hand thumping) (both laughing) - So, what gives? You know, your dad says you moved into that place, you know, with those guys. What, are you nuts? - Bill Thomas, Mickey O'Neill. - Hi. - [Male Shopper] Pete, where's the broccoli? - So, when we gonna shoot some pool? Yeah, I need, I need donations. - I left my cue over my old man's. We had a fight and I haven't been back. - Oh, man. Oh, you know, eat some crow. You know, go get your cue, I'll see you on the table. Look, I gotta go. (hand thumping) - See you at the table. (keys jingling) - [Mickey] Yeah. (door thumping) (car revving) (car rumbling) (wheels squealing) - Sorry if I tainted your reputation. - Well, I don't taint easy. (door thumping) (phone ringing) (feet shuffling) (door clicking) (phone message bleeping) - [Barbara] Hi, Bill. Bill? (buttons clicking) Bill, are ya there? (door clicking) It's Barbara, surprise. (phone message bleeping) - What are you doing? - This thing is screwy. (tape rewind squealing) Some dame was talking, a Barbara somebody. - My sister. What'd she say? - I don't know. - What did you erase it? (phone message bleeping) - So, sue me. - Well, why don't you just leave this thing alone, all right? Please, just don't touch it. - Hey, you know, nobody asked you to bring this thing in here. This is my phone with my number and I don't really appreciate having my friends call- - Really? and get a message- - And how many- from some stranger! - Of your friends- Have bothered to dial your number because your phone hasn't rung once since I've been here! - Shove it! - Oh, how original. (door slamming) (referee whistle tweeting) (crowd roaring) - [Game Announcer] It's Keith, Keith to Johnson. Johnson with a beautiful pass to Barrows and Barrows from the three point! (trash can thumping) (thunder rumbling) Pete Johnson is on point tonight, he's already had 12 points in the first half. (referee whistles tweeting) Okay, Keith to Johnson. (beer cans rattling) Oh, and floor scrap (papers rustling) with seconds to go on the night. (basketball crowd roaring) - Oh, man. - [Game Announcer] Johnson's really taking off here. Coming in from North Carolina State, he set's back. He's been on the Seattle's team for three years. - Made you a salad. Take it, helps prevent night blindness, beriberi and scurvy. (thunder rumbling) - [Game Announcer] Up over the center line and Jackson draws another jumper, great shot. (basketball crowd murmuring) - How's your stew. - Needs salt. (Bill chuckling) (thunder rumbling) Well, last thing I need right now is scurvy. - Listen, I'm sorry about the telephone business. - Yeah, forget it. (basketball game murmuring) - I never used to have such a short fuse, it's not like me. - People shoulda knew us when, huh? - Seeing people running around like that, (coughing) I try to remember what it felt like. - Yeah, look at the ref, he must run 100 miles a night. (door buzzing) (referee whistles tweeting) - I'll get it. - [Game Announcer] Hamilton on the three point line- (feet thumping) (door squeaking) - [Bill] Barb, what are you doing here? - Didn't you get my message? - No, not at all. - Oh. - C'mon in, the machine's been acting up. Tim Reilly, this is my sister, Barbara Thomas. - Well, I can see you wanna have a little family titty-tat, so I'm gonna take a walk. - It's raining. - Yeah. (basketball game murmuring) Yeah, when I was in prison, one of the things I missed most was walking in the rain. - Happy to have met you, Mr. Reilly. - Same here. Oh, let me guess. Single lady, attractive, master's degree in business administration, I'll bet. You're the top rep, 13 Eastern states, for a bra company. - (laughing) Oh, nothing quite so sexy, I'm afraid. I work as a customer rep for an airline. - Well, you're still attractive. At least I got that, right. - [Game Announcer] So, to get to the play-off, from the foul line, three point shot! - Well. (laughing) (rain splashing) - Oo, what a storm! (door squeaking) (rain splashing) (bar patrons murmuring) (Logan laughing) (rain splashing) (blues saxophone music) (car alarm wailing) (rain splashing) (blues saxophone music) - Oh, I haven't got any, if you want some I can maybe get it. - Yeah, well, I'll let you know. - Mm. (rain splashing) (players murmuring) - Hey, take your shot, will ya. (rain pounding) (blues saxophone music) (car horn blaring) - [Car Driver] Hey, watch where you're going! (tires screeching) (horn honking) - [2nd Car Driver] Look out, you idiot! - Ah, shut up! - [2nd Car Driver] Ah, screw you, pal! (blues saxophone music) (rain pounding) (Jim choking) (hand pounding) (door squeaking) (door slamming) (Bill coughing) (thunder rumbling) - Mm. (sniffing) (TV remote clicking) (basketball game murmuring) (TV remote thumping) (referee whistles tweeting) - [Game Announcer] Perkins, who's the center from North Carolina State, fourth draft choice, bringing the ball up over the center line. A top player over these last two years, Perkins passes over to Williams, (Bill coughing) Williams for the lay-up, great shot. (Bill coughing) (rain splashing) (basketball game murmuring) (Bill coughing) (door knocking) - (coughing) Yes. Hold on. (door squeaking) Sorry if I'm disturbing, my... (hand thumping) - I see you've got your own drug store. - Nothing very good for pain, I'm afraid. - No, I, I was just wondering if you needed anything? - No, thanks. - All right. (basketball game murmuring) - [Game Announcer] Johnson got off a great shot, right up the middle, it was a great shot. (Bill sighing) (Bill coughing) (thunder rumbling) - I've got it turned down so low now I need captions. - [Game Announcer] And he has the ball going all the way- - Oh, that's fine, I'm just having a little difficulty breathing tonight. - [Game Announcer] Straight up- - [Jim] Did you take your medicine? That stuff? - Yeah. - I'm sorry about your sister, I hope I didn't shake her up too bad. - Ah, you did in a way. - Up for a lay-up- Surprising, I always think of her as the ice lady. - Yeah. What's the, um, the book? - "Moby Dick", Melville. - You brought a lotta books with ya. - Oh, just the ones that I want around me when I, well... - At the end, huh? Well... - I still have problems saying it. - Not me, I just don't believe it. - Guess these are my way of escaping. I used to travel quite a bit, it's not so easy anymore. - Mm. - (throat clearing) It's funny how certain books can really, really take you places. - (laughing) You sound like an ad for the public library. - (laughing) Yeah. Have you ever been on the ocean? - Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, my old man, he was a sailmaker back when. - Listen to this. "With the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows, so, at nightfall the Nantucketer, out of side of land, furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales." (rain splashing) (thunder rumbling) - Hm, yeah, ah, it's all right. (Bill coughing) - Well, I think I'm gonna try and get some sleep. Good night. - Night. - [Game Announcer] Going to King, King up over the center line. King dances around Johnson and he's up for the lay-up! (basketball fans cheering) Great shot for King. (quiet music) (rain splashing) (feet thudding) (traffic humming) - (whistling) Man, you look like you just stepped outta one of them clothes catalogs. - Thank you. - In my neighborhood that's considered an insult. - Oh, ho-ho, that's funny. (Jim laughing) Listen, if anyone calls, will you tell 'em at the University Women's Club. - You know, I don't get it. You, you get all duded up so you can look like nothing's wrong, (door thumping) you can stand up in front of a buncha people and talk about a disease that nobody wants to even mention. - Somewhere in there I think you answered your own question. Would do you like to come? - No, thanks. - Hey Jim, hold on! Brought your cue by. - Thanks. (car door thumping) (traffic humming) - I was in the neighborhood. - Bill Thomas, my old man, Barney. - Mr. Reilly. - Well, this is a pretty nice place. I see why you didn't wanna stay with your old man. - We don't do well in the same cage. - Oh, so now my place is a cage. - Oh, for Pete's sake, will you cut it! - Of course, it's an okay place to crash when you can't see straight, then it's okay. - (sighing) Look, thanks for bringing this by. - Every once in a while I keep thinking you'll catch me by surprise and act like a son. - I've been hearing the same song since I was 13. - Ah. Oh, by the way, the last time you used the car, you left the tank empty. - Yeah? (dog barking) Well, I meant to put gas in. - The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. - I never saw anyone who knew as much about the road to Hell as you do. - Always the big mouth. - Look, look, thanks for bringing this by, I'll, I'll try and be over and see ya. - I figure if you wait much longer you won't have to come over at all, right? Fine. (traffic humming) (dog barking) - I take it he's a little put out that you're living here. - That's not it really, mostly he's just scared. See, he's, he's dying of cancer and he's afraid I'll go before he does. You hit the ball with this end. - Community organizations like this one have proved to be the real pioneers in the struggle against AIDS. (woman throat clearing) Seriously, this is not a popular cause in most levels of government, but people like you in groups like this have raised the issues and demanded action. People like you have provided prevention and care services to those who need it. Thank you for coming. I'll answer any questions if, if you have them. - I have a question. - Yes. - And I think it should be asked before we continue to let these hearts and flowers speeches lead us to deplete our resources while the reckless behavior that spreads this disease goes on as though nothing has happened. Now I, for one, am quite frankly fed up with the way these homosexuals persist in flaunting their high risk living habits and then come crying to us once they discover, my oh my, that they've been infected. - My sentiments exactly! That's exactly the way I felt, ma'am. (women softly exclaiming) That is, that's the way I felt until I got AIDS and believe me, I'm as straight as you can get without a license. (women laughing) I like your dress. (women laughing) Yeah, that's right, I got AIDS from a blood transfusion in that wonderful sterile hospital not 20 blocks from where you sit. Am I mad? You're damn right I'm mad. Do I need help? Never before in my life until right now. Once you get it, you start grabbing for the newspaper every day to see if they found the answer to AIDS, the magic bullet. You don't reach for the funnies or the sports page first anymore and then you sorta realize that the answer's gonna come from places just like this. From people like you who wanna know and who aren't ready to take "I don't know" for an answer. You know, my grandma used to say they used to tell kids they got the mumps because they talked too much. (women laughing) Yeah, I said, "Andy, you know, I can't find my shoes" you know. (laughing) - Oh, it was really good, yeah. (all laughing) Oh, this looks like we're leaving you. - Oh. - See ya later. - Nice meeting you. - Good night. (throat clearing) - Hey, come on, lighten-up, will ya? I'm sorry I crabbed your act. - So you went, "I like your dress." - Hey, it's gonna get a laugh, isn't it? - This is my not the laugh circuit, these meetings are serious business. These people come to be informed, not amused. They don't come to hear some hammy, homey parables about kids with mumps. - It doesn't hurt to let 'em think we're human, does it? - Get in. (door clicking) - I tell you what? (women murmuring) Why don't you just go to hell? I'm gonna go shoot some pool. (car engine rumbling) (car door slamming) (door squeaking) (TV basketball murmuring) - [Game Announcer] Something Seattle's lacking- (briefcase thumping) Is a strong forward to post up. Someone who's decent with post passes- (TV remote clicking) (TV remote clicking) (basketball game murmuring) (fans cheering) Something that Seattle's not been able to do is get the ball into the post area. (doorbell buzzing) (footsteps thudding) (referee whistles tweeting) Oh, man, look at this, straight-up the floor play- (door squeaking) - Oh, uh... Mr. Thomas, right? - Right. - Is, uh, is Jim here? - No, I'm sorry, he's not. - Oh, is he due back soon, do you know? - Well, he didn't say. You're welcome to come in and wait if you'd like. - No, ah, no, no, I, I mean, who knows when he'll be back, right? - Can I give him a message? - Um, yeah. Um, when I was here before I meant to ask him where it was I should take the car to get the, my breaks fixed- - Right. - On the car, you know. - Well, I'll ask him to give you a call. - Uh, you know, I'm sorry I sorta blew up in front of you earlier, Mr. Thomas, but Jim and I used to be a lotta laughs together. I don't know what happened. I, I meant no offense about your place- - Oh, please don't let it bother you, Mr. Reilly. - The last time I was called Mr. Reilly, it was a cop giving me a ticket. Barney. - Bill. - Bill. You know, Jim's a good boy, really, just never had a helluva lotta respect for authority. I mean, never! - Barney, you sound exactly like my father. (Barney laughing) (Barney coughing) - Ah, well, sorta like a club, I guess, father's. - I just remembered, Jim said that he was going to shoot some pool. - Oh, well, he'll be a while, then. I hope he doesn't drink too much, on account of those headaches he gets. Will you do me a favor, you tell him. I mean, from me it doesn't count. - Do you know where he plays? - Ah, at Grandview's over on Gates, the old place. (jukebox blues music) (pool players murmuring) (balls clinking) (pool players murmuring) - Will someone hit me with a card? Don't take all day. - [Pool Player] Easy one to sink. - [Player 2] Oh, I don't know, I haven't been there. - [Player 3] It's a town right there. - [Player 4] Oh, good shot, very good shot. - [Player 3] I don't anyone else who would see that. It'd be great if we played pool together. Say, don't ya think? - Oh, c'mon! - [Player 4] Anyway- - It's a scam, I think. (player laughing) - Hi there. - Hi. - You lost? - I thought you might need this. - Thanks. (jukebox blues music) (players murmuring) - Hey, Jimmy, now you got a partner, whatd'ya say we get down to some serious betting? - (laughing) I don't think so. - Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, Bill Thomas, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, Millard Yanke. Grab yourself a stick. - Millard? - No cracks, Millard was my mother's piano teacher. I don't play piano. - No, no, it's, uh, it's a unusual name. Actually, I have a friend named Millard. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Well, now you got two friends named Millard, only this one's about to become co-owner of your house and car. - Okay, one game for charity, okay, but that's it. - No way, buck a ball, same as always. - You ever play this before? - What, what do they call the white ball? - You break. (balls clanking) You, uh, take the white ball and you put it anywhere you like behind those spots. - [Jim] Yeah, right in there, yeah. - It's fine. - Johnny! - Just hit it easy, okay? Don't jab it. - You don't wanna chip the balls. (laughing) - [Pool Player] Play to seven? - Yeah. (both laughing) (balls clacking) (jukebox blues music) - It's, (sputtering) lucky. (Jim laughing) (Bill throat clearing) - [Pool Player] They've got a game going over there. (balls thudding) - Jimmy, you set me up, man. - [Bill] Three ball in the side pocket. - [Mickey] What's this a ringer, Jim? (Jim laughing) - C'mon, you don't really know another guy named Millard, do ya? - Five in the side. (balls clicking) - [Millard] Jimmy, I thought we were friends. - [Bill] Woo-hoo, hoo-hoo! (rain splashing) (Jim laughing) (coughing) Oh! - $23 for me and $23 for you! - That's it? - 46 bucks, man, you were great. (Bill laughing) Some of those shots I'm gonna dream about. - Hey, listen, about what happened tonight? That meeting? I'm sorry, I acted like an ass. I apologize. - Ah, forget it. (hand thumping) "What do they call the white ball?" (Jim laughing) (hand thumping) - I gotcha. (laughing) Yeah, Jimmy, I had fun tonight! - Hey, you know what we oughta do? Me and you, (Bill coughing) we oughta go across country. I'll set 'em up, you run the table, huh? What a pair we'll be. - Uh-huh. - How about Terrible Thomas and Wiley Reilly. Huh? - Ho-ho. - That's got a nice ring to it, don't it, huh? - Oh, dear. - We'll clean up coast to coast. (rain splashing) C'mon. - Oh, hey, your dad came by tonight. Something about where should he should get his brakes fixed? He said you'd know what he was talking about? Jim? What is it? Is it a headache? (coughing) Hey, you okay? (Jim sobbing) (thunder rumbling) You gotta find out what's causing these. - Shut up. Just shut up. - I'm only trying to help you. - Don't try! This isn't my disease, it's yours! I didn't go out bed hopping for this fairy virus of yours. I'm dying, see? (rain splashing) That make you feel good, sweetie? Maybe you'll get even for all those queer jokes I told over the years. (sobbing) You think you're, you're so cool! You're so strong, a real role model for all the pretty boys. - Damn you. What, do you think this is a war where you're gonna be decorated for your wounds and I'm gonna be tried for war crimes? How dare you judge my pain! How dare you assume that I'm not hurting. When I found out, I walked out in the woods and I screamed, "Why me?" I scream til I lost my voice, I was weak. I'm no role model! I'm not strong, I'm terrified! Every morning I wake up afraid. I, I, I look into the mirror looking for some new change in my body since yesterday. I'm 33, I feel like I'm 80. I wanna cry for me but I don't dare because it takes lung power to cry and when I see you like this, damn you, I even wanna cry for you, but I'm afraid of getting holes in my lungs. God, it's pathetic, isn't it? Pathetic, I don't even have the luxury of crying anymore. (poignant music) (rain splashing) (thunder rumbling) Let's go home. (poignant music) (rain splashing) (car door thumping) (traffic humming) - [Jim] Last time I was laid out like this, they were sewing me up. - Nothing so drastic today. (equipment beeping) - I watched them. - You did, eh? - Yeah, and I had an out of body experience. You ever know anybody who had one? - Now lie still. - Oh, what are the odds. A million pints of blood, save one for Old Jimmy Reilly. (equipment beeping) Beep, beep, beep. Staring right into my brain. A man's got no damn privacy at all anymore. I should've stayed in the Marine Corps. First, I should have joined the Marine Corps. Ah, me, phew. (equipment beeping) Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. (somber music) (crow squawking) (pigeons cooing) (car humming) (car door thumping) (somber music) (traffic humming) (pigeons cooing) (somber music) You never see a dead pigeon. - Come to think of it... - There must be thousands of 'em up there flying around, (laughing) you never see one come falling out of the air. They can't last forever, where do they go? - I like little mysteries. Don't you? - Small brain tumors. That figures, they always hit you where your weakest. - I've read that they've had some success with implant radiation. - Oh, forget it. I'm gonna find the secrets of the pigeons. I kept having these dreams, you know? I see these headlines, "Total Reverse, Complete Recovery, First AIDS Survivor, Ex-Con Freed Again" and it's like walking out of a movie theater in the middle of the afternoon. It's all real again. The popcorn, the Juju Fruit's are stuck to your teeth, only there ain't no great white horse Silver to jump on and ride away. Just small brain tumors growing. You know, I never really believed that this was God's way of cleaning house. - I never thought you did. - Then there's probably something else you know, Lisa. Under other circumstances, with me finally getting my act together a little bit, sitting here like this, (laughing) I'd probably be trying to find a way to get you to take me seriously. - Mm, if it makes a difference, I'm honored, Mr. Reilly. - It makes a difference. They know we wanna know, but they're not talking! (both laughing) - Do you think you should take custody of the pills under the circumstances? - Oh, the more I take the less good they do. - You feel pain, you call me. - [Jim] Please pick up, Lisa. (phone ringing) - [Answering Machine] Hi, this is Lisa Elliott, you can leave a message- - Oh, God, Lisa! - [Answering Machine] For me at the beep. - [Jim] Are you there? - [Answering Machine] If you're calling for the AIDS walkathon, - [Jim] Hey! - [Answering Machine] Please call 555-7979, thanks. (answering machine beeping) - Lisa, for God's sakes, pick up the phone! Call me. (sobbing) I need a pill bad. Please call me, damn it! (receiver banging) - Ah, oh! (sobbing) I just need a pill! God! (sobbing) (Jim panting) (police siren wailing) (matchbooks rattling) Shit! (sobbing) (vase thumping) (Jim panting) (paper rustling) (drawer thumping) (Jim sobbing) (paper rustling) (dishes crashing) Where's a damn pill! God! (panting) (Jim sobbing) (canisters crashing) (hands scrambling) (lamp shattering) (phone buzzing) (painting thumping) Uh! (hand slamming) Oh, God! (sobbing) Ah, oh! God! (bottles crashing) God, ah! Ah! (glass crashing) (Jim panting) God, God! (bottles crashing) Help me! (Jim panting) (hands banging) Hey! Hey, answer the door! (hands banging) C'mon! - What do you want? (television murmuring) - I need a pain pill, man, loan me a couple, just, just one even. (sobbing) - I don't have any. (door slamming) - For God's sake, (hands slamming) everybody's got a pain pill! God. (sobbing) Hey! (hands slamming) Hey, c'mon! (sobbing) - Hey you, are you drunk again? - Hey, man, I need a pill. (panting) - You're not supposed to reside here with a habit! Go back! (door slamming) - I don't have a habit, you jerk! (hands slamming) (sobbing) My head's killing me! - Hey, hey, you woke me up, what's the big idea? Are you loaded? (Jim sobbing) - Just listen to me, please! (gasping) My head's coming off, honest. - Yeah, join the club. - Loan me a pain pill, please! - I don't loan pills or hundred dollar bill! - God, don't get cute, (foot stomping) I'm dying, c'mon! - Haven't you heard, we're all dying! - Give me a pill! (door slamming) - Oh, oh, oh-oh! (sobbing) Ah, ah-ah, ah! (panting) Hey! (hands slamming) Hey! (foot stomping) I'm back! - [Eldon] I'm calling the police! - Go ahead, call the cops! - We shouldn't have to put up with this! - I hope you don't sleep for a week. - You're the greatest, Florence Nightingale! God! (sobbing) Oh, God! (sobbing) You faggots! (panting) (motorcycle rumbling) ♪ God and all the roses calling ♪ (traffic humming) (neon sign buzzing) (bottle thumping) Oh, gosh. Oh.

(keys clanging) The pain, Billy, it was killing me and I, I couldn't find the pills and Lisa wasn't home (solemn music) and forgive me, Billy. Forgive me, I'll get it. Let me get it, Billy. Let me get it, Billy,- - Hey, Jim, c'mon. - I'll get it, Billy. - It's not important. C'mon, it's okay. (glass grinding) Up. - Billy. - Let's get up. - Naw, Billy, I'll get it. (solemn music) (debris crunching) - It's okay. (feet thumping) All right, take it easy. Easy. (Jim sighing) - Don't believe everything you hear, Billy. - Not a chance. (poignant music) (light switch clicking) (phone pulsing) (poignant music) (phone receiver thumping) (poignant music) (Bill sobbing) - This new program promises to be very helpful, I urge you all to register. I'll have new insurance forms by Friday and you can also pick them up at the clinic starting Monday. Also, the University Health Service will be issuing a monthly AIDS bulletin next month with the latest available treatment and research data. I have cards to put you on the free mailing list. Anything else? - Yeah, Lisa? What's the grace period for rent? - I know. Um, they sent your check to the old address again. I called 'em yesterday and told them to get up to speed. Don't worry about it, Norma. - Thank you. Gee, I love computers, you know? - A small matter, but this should be fair warning. Unless we all start cleaning the lint out of the dryer after every use, we're all gonna be drying our clothes on clothes lines- - [Resident] You got that right, man. - For the whole world to see. Won't that be interesting? - Let's watch the lint, folks. Um, anything else? - Yes, I have something else. I think it's time that we enforce some of the basic rules around here. - Meaning what specifically, Eldon? - Meaning Mr. Jim Reilly, specifically. - Who doesn't happen to be here, right? - Who doesn't dare happen to be here, no doubt. It was made clear to all of us when we moved in here that the residents would not tolerate alcoholism, using or disruptive behavior. - Please. - May I finish? - This last time did it. - Huh, for me and others, I might add. - [Stuart] Oh, yeah. - Now he comes banging on doors, yelling, cursing, demanding pills, acting like a drunken crazy man. - [Lisa] About the pills, I'm afraid that's partly my doing, you see- - [Eldon] No, we can't let you take the blame for his behavior, Lisa. - [Stuart] MM-mm, no way. - It might help you to know that he's sometimes in a great deal of pain. - None of us is really blessed by the bloom of good health, you know, and I don't think we can let a relationship stand in the way of our decision to do something about this. - (laughing) Relationship? The only relationship that I have with Jim Reilly is as a friend. - Mm, mm. - What, what the hell is going on here? This is beautiful. We are gathered in this humanitarian shelter, all eager to vote to shoot a barking dog. I thought this place was started for people who were suffering. If you you're not hurting, then you don't belong here, right? So, what, are we gonna gather here and one by one throw out noise makers for disturbing the peace? Of course it's not perfect, but if it's perfection you're looking for, you've got the wrong address. You know, I, I am quite certain that I'm the last person in the world that Jim Reilly would think about living his final days with, and yet I was the one that wanted to duck and run first and we're all going to need more and more help as time goes on, all of us, and the next time that Jim comes banging on your doors, crying out for help, why don't you think about what you can do for him instead of how fast you can slam the door? - Compromise, (traffic humming) I'll give you three pills at a time, when you're down to one, you call me and I'll give you three more. That way you'll always have a spare. We can't have you banging on doors begging pills. - I know, that was dumb. I should've known they'd climb on ya for it. - Oh, I'm not complaining, I'm explaining. - Well anyway, thanks for coming to my defense. - Oh, it wasn't me, it was Bill. - You're kidding me? - Why would I make up something like that? - What'd he say? - Nevermind what he said. (laughing) - C'mon, what'd he say? - If you wanna know what goes on at meetings, show up! (hand thumping) (Jim laughing) You know, all I can say, if you had Bill as a lawyer, I'd bet the ranch you'd never have served time. (Jim laughing) (car horn honking) (door clicking) (footsteps thudding) - Hey man, I, I, I just heard and I appreciate it, I, I really do. - Forget it. - No, (laughing) I owe you one now. - Look, I said, forget it, all right! - All right. - Look, I'm, I'm sorry. (footsteps thudding) I'm sorry. Don't know why I just can't say thank you or you're welcome anymore. - So where you preaching tonight, Reverend? - No, these are my guest-of-honor clothes. Buncha friends of mine are throwing me a birthday party down at the Hastings Club. - Hm. - Look, the, the party wasn't my idea but- - Yeah, but the last party I'd wanna go to anyways is where they count birthdays. You have a good time. (thunder rumbling) - Good night. (door thumping) (guests murmuring) It was actually my birthday yesterday but we're celebrating it today. - [Woman Guest] Yeah, yeah. - [Bill] It's all behind. - [Woman Guest] Remember last year? - But thank you, thank you very much. - Nice. - See you later. - [Male Guest] Can I please have a Scotch? - [Female Guest] No way- - It's awful news about Millard, huh? - Millard? Millard Evans? (guest laughing) When? - God, Bill, I thought you heard this morning. - No, I, I, my sister told me he was in Houston for radiation. - Here, let me take that for ya. - God, I've known him since kindergarten. - Honestly, Bill, I, I thought you knew or I never would've said anything. - He's dead. (sighing) I'm not feeling very well. - Look do you wanna take a walk outside or something? I- - No, I'm sorry, Phil, I can't handle this, will you make my apologies? - Oh, sure, sure- - Thank you. - It's no problem. Look, why don't I get someone to, uh, to drive you home? - Bill, are you okay? - Some birthday, huh? Forgive me.

(Jim and Mickey laughing) - [Woman Guest] Blow out the candles. - Told you I didn't play piano, but I hear you do. - Yeah. - He sure does. - Well, c'mon, get over there! - Yeah! - C'mon, Bill! (guests applauding) - Yeah, c'mon! - Play something. - Oh, dear. - So, uh, name your poison, pal. - You just start playing, Millard, and I'll catch up. - Okay. - Woo! (saxophone swing music) - [Female Guest] Nice. - [Male Guest] C'mon, Bill. (guests murmuring) (piano and saxophone music) - [Male Guest] Yeah! - Woo! (lively piano and saxophone music) - [Female Guest] I wanna dance! (guests murmuring) (guests laughing) (Jim's fingers snapping) - C'mon. (guests laughing) - [Male Guest] Oh, good! - Yeah! (piano solo music) (lively swing music) (Bill laughing) (guests applauding) - [Male Guest] Yeah, yeah! - Woo! Yeah! (woman laughing) (traffic humming) (tires screeching) - Um, right there. Okay, you know, we've got this taken care of. (Bill coughing) Great. Good doing business with you. - Nice to see you. Bye, now. - Hey, what's that? A summons? - No, a deed. - A deed? - Mm-hm. A little place I've had my eye on. - Why, I thought you liked it here. - You can't be serious! - Well, where is this little place you've had your eye on? - Oh, sorta out in the country. - A country place? - Yep. - You have a country place? - Mm-hm. - This I must see. C'mon, let's- - (laughing) Naw, some other day. - No, no, let's go and see it, ah, please, my car's right here. - Okay, but don't expect me to ask you to move in with me. - (sputtering) Surely you jest. The day you seek other quarters I will immediately become 10 years younger. (Jim laughing) Please. - Why, thank you, sir. - "A country place", that's the title of a Francis Farmer movie. So, this is it, huh? - [Jim] Yeah, right here under these trees. It's a little cramped but it's all mine. - Ah, it's a nice neighborhood, actually. - Look at the view, huh? Nice trees, big lawn. - Yep. - It's peaceful. (crows cawing) Some of the funerals I've seen here. Nine blocks of black limos, you wouldn't believe it. - You sound like a regular. - Yeah. (Jim laughing) I used to come here a lot as a kid, you know, whenever I needed somebody to talk to. My mother, she's buried right over there. - You know, geologically speaking, this whole area was at one point totally underwater. - Really? - Right where you're sitting, this was the bottom of the ocean. - My lot right here? - Yep. Bottom of the ocean. - Man they drained it just in time, didn't they? (both laughing) (poignant music) - Yeah. - [Lisa] May I make a suggestion? - [Jim] No! - You can't wind up taking pills by the bowlful, Jim, I think you should at least consider radiation treatments! - (sobbing) You first! Let 'em drill holes in your head, tell me how it feels! (sobbing) - That's not quite how it works, I've been reading up on this, it's- - No one asked you to study my case! If I wanted a second opinion, I'd ask for it! (sobbing) - We're not attacking you, Jim, we're only trying to help you make an informed decision! - The hell with you! The hell with both of you! (body slamming) And this place! Get off my back and stay off! (door slamming) (Bill coughing) - Any suggestions? - We've gotta speak to him when he's not in so much pain. He's irrational. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God, he took my car keys! He drives like a maniac! (car door thumping) (car rumbling) - We gotta get him, he'll kill himself. (tires squealing) (urgent music) (traffic humming) - It's no use. - Try Gates, he may have gone over by the pool hall. (urgent music) (tires squealing) (water splashing) Oh, God. - No. (tires squealing) (sirens wailing) (ominous music) Don't move him. (ominous music) (water splashing) (monitors beeping) - [P.A. announcer] Paging Dr. Charles to operating theater. Please report to the theater, Dr. Charles. - Well, he suffered a concussion, which I'm sure you know he doesn't really need. He needs around the clock observation but there's just no one available. - I'm available. (poignant music) (blinds rattling) (poignant music) (IV dripping) (poignant music) Oo, ah! (Bill groaning) (poignant music) (poignant music) (poignant music) - Bill? - Huh? - You can't keep this up. Go get some air. Go down and get a cup of coffee, maybe. (Bill coughing) - All right. - I'll sit with him. - Mm! (groaning) If he wakes up just call a nurse. - Right. (ambulance siren wailing) (Barney sighing) I got the brakes fixed. So, what else is new, right? Mickey tells me that you and your friend really burned up the felt at the pool hall. Who would've guessed, huh? Life is full of surprises, sure enough. You know, I was reading the other day (poignant music) that people who are unconscious, even on the operating table can hear when someone's talking. I found that interesting. So, if you tell me in a week that you heard I got my brakes fixed, we'll know, right? (poignant music) Come on, Jim Boy, You can't go before me. Show a little respect, huh? Your old man needs you at his funeral. See, it'd be nice, a few people standing around, have 'em say, "Yeah, that's his boy." You gotta be there, don't you see? That's how it's supposed to work. You hear? (poignant music) - Ah, how long I've been here? - Oh, you've been here two days, I... - How about this guy, huh, Billy? - What'd you expect? - And where in the hell have you been? - Well, he- - I will say this for you, you bring fresh meaning to the phrase pain in the ass. (Jim laughing) (traffic humming) (horn honking) - [Lisa] Come on, Jim, I'm serious. You've been in the hospital for two weeks, you're not back to normal yet. The doctor said you have to take it easy for at least a month. - [Jim] Sorry about your car, but actually I was doing you a favor. - Mm, how could I ever thank you? (doors thumping) Norma? What's up, where's Bill? - Uh, he asked me to drive him to the doctor, he wasn't up to it. - The doctor? - Hey Jimmy, sorry about your bang up. - Thanks. - So, I'll go pick him up in an hour unless you're going that way? - Oh, I'm going that way. Come on, I'll get you to bed. - I just got outta bed, let's go. - You can see these small cystic areas here. They could mean any number of things, of course, but- - None of them cheerful. - (sighing) You know the book on it as well as I do, Bill. The chills and shortness of breath gives us no choice. I've got to do a bronchoscopy and get some tissue from the lungs. - When? - Well, day before yesterday would've been preferable. Hi, Lisa, come to see the picture show? - I never see anything in these. So, what's your story? - He's gotta do a biopsy for BCP. - Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Oh, yeah, it's not exactly a vacant room up here, you know. (traffic humming) (monitors beeping) - Are you family? - I'm his mother. You think I'm too young to be his mother, don't you? - Not really. - Hey, Billy. - Hi, Mom. - So, what's the good word? - Pain. I feel like I have an elephant sitting on my chest. - Oh, well, that's a good sign, elephants. Elephants and little people. - Uh-huh. - I, uh, I brought the book you asked for, uh, "Huckleberry Finn". - Thanks. - Seems sorta like kid stuff if you ask me, (laughing) I mean for grown men. - You'll surprise yourself. - Me? (laughing) - [Bill] Go ahead. - Well, all right, but remember, you, uh, you asked for it. (laughing) "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth." Oh, well, it's gonna be fun. - [Bill] Keep, keep reading. - "That is nothing. (poignant music) I never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was Aunt Polly or the Widow or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly, Tom's Aunt Polly she is, and Mary and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, I suspect." - Keep, keep reading. - "Now, the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich." (pump hissing) (Bill coughing) (monitors beeping) (Bill coughing) (Bill choking) (Bill gasping) (monitors beeping) (Bill coughing) (Bill gasping) - The air leak in the lung is not healing. It will have to be closed surgically. Also, the liver was sending out some abnormal readings. We took an ultrasound scan and it shows tuberculosis of the liver. We have to do this without delay. Bill has already given his consent. - But now? - Well, I'd like to do it at 6:00 AM, I can get the O.R. and the nurses I prefer then. Dr. Morgan will assist. - Well, he's been an early riser as long as I've known him. (gurney wheels clacking) - You'll be just fine. - Anything happens, (gasping) you take the books and the towels. - Boy, have you turned into a con artist. You're just testing me to see if I'm gonna leave you my cue stick and TV. We'll settle our estates when you get home. - Home. - Give em hell, Billy. (gurney wheels clacking) - I'm going to wait with Bill's parents. - God, I hate these places. I'm gonna get some air. (poignant music) (thunder rumbling) (siren wailing) (poignant music) (pigeons cooing) (poignant music) (door thumping) (poignant music) (footsteps thumping) (doorbell buzzing) (footsteps thudding) (poignant music) (door thumping) (Lisa sighing) - I should've stayed at the hospital. - No, he wouldn't have expected it. - Dad said that he, he sat by my bed for two days and nights when I was out of it. (laughing) - Yes. - His mother wants to know if you'll say something at the service. (poignant music) (Jim crying) (birds singing) - I'm proud that I was asked to say something here today, it feels good to get it said. Me and Bill, we only knew each other lately in our lives. Actually, we knew very little about each other, but it seems we understood what needed understanding. I wasn't like him at all, but I, I liked him a lot. I think we were friends but, you know, if we hadn't both been dying, I don't think we would've taken the trouble to become friends at all. Maybe that says something about the world. I'm not grateful for my affliction, But honest to God, I feel that I'm a better person because my illness led me to meet this man we're saying goodbye to today. Not too long ago Bill told me that this whole place here was at the bottom of the ocean and it reminded me of one of his favorite pieces from a book and I thought he might like to hear it one last time. "With the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows, so, at nightfall the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales." Sleep well, Billy, it's growing dark for all of us. (poignant music) - Um, I hope you folks don't mind, I'm Jim's father. I, uh, I used to work for a sailmaker years back and I remembered a few stitches. I, I sewed one of those big quilt pieces for your son. You know, one of those, the big, big AIDS quilt. It just says, "Bill T, he cared and so do we." Here. (distant church bell tolling) - Thank you so much. - Your son was quite a laddie. - Yes, he was. Thank you. (sobbing) (church bells tolling) (crows cawing) (TV tennis crowd murmuring) - [Tennis Commentator] 15/love, James is the 17th seed. And the serve. (door knocking) (door bell buzzing) - Yeah, Lisa, it's open! - Jim Reilly, this is David Morgan. - Davey, how is it going? - Look, I know all about seniority. See, all my life, wherever I've gone, always been the newcomer. I'm not really impressed with rank, okay? So, let's get one thing straight right from the start. I'm gonna make it, you hear? I'm not gonna lie down and give up and I don't wanna hear any doom and gloom speeches from old timers. I'm gonna beat this thing and I don't wanna hear otherwise. Is that acceptable? - You walked in the right door, Davey Boy, you're looking at your biggest fan and strongest rooter. I hope you live next to forever and that I'm still around to cheer you on. You like tennis? - Yeah, all but women's doubles. - What's wrong with women's doubles? Well, we'll talk about it. (hopeful music) - So, uh, how come you get the front bedroom where all the action is? - [Jim] You wouldn't like it in there, Davey, it's noisy, cramped- - {David] Which means the other one's dark and stuffy, huh? - [Jim] Trust me, Davey. - [Lisa] Why don't you two flip to see who gets the front bedroom? - [David] Yeah, any objections? - [Jim] You gotta coin, Davey Boy? (uplifting music) (peaceful classical music)
