( theme music playing ) Announcer: The following is a presentation of HBO Sports. ( clanging ) ( music playing ) Commentator: Diver Greg Louganis-- reverse two and one half somersault. Commentator #2: Some say "Lou-gannis" and some say "Lou-gainis." What is it? Commentator #3: And here he is-- Greg Louganis, 16 years old. Interviewer: Greg, you really have the diving world at your feet. I realize it's no fluke. - Do you realize it's no fluke? - Uh... - ( whistle blows ) - Commentator #4: But I'll tell ya, here's a young man to be reckoned with. Commentator #5: Nobody has all of what Greg has. He is the consummate diver. Commentator #6: Mechanically, he's one of the soundest divers I've ever seen, but diving is such a mental sport and it's just awfully tough to put it all together. Commentator #7: Everybody's wondering, "Well, when is this kid gonna falter?" ( phone line ringing ) Recording: Thank you for calling Bank of America. We are a debt collector. We have multiple loans on record. Are you calling about your active loan? Yes. Was that a yes? - Commentator: Yes! - ( crowd cheering ) Commentator #2: What an athlete. Commentator #3: Everyone agrees he has perfect form in one of the most demanding individual events in the world of sport-- diving. Female commentator: Best diver in the world. The best diver in the history of diving. Commentator #4: When you think of diving, one name comes to mind, and that's Greg Louganis. ( overlapping voices ) Greg Louganis. Greg Louganis. Greg Louganis is your gold medal winner! ( music playing ) ( crowd cheering, applauding ) Announcer: Well, ladies and gentlemen, our grand marshal, Olympic gold medalist, we all know, Greg Louganis! Considered the greatest diver in American history. During his diving career, he won an unprecedented 47 national, 13 world championships, including two gold medals in 1984 and one silver in '76. - A real Olympian. - Yeah. - No fake ones here. - Hold on, we're taking lots of pictures. Louganis: Who is Greg Louganis? What kind of question is that? Who is Greg Louganis? Who is Greg Louganis? I don't know. It's interesting because I know that if you talk about Olympic diving... ...then my name is the one that comes up. But I've been absent from diving for, gosh, close to 20 years. Female reporter: Do you remember four-time Olympic gold diving champion Greg Louganis? Well, now there may be a new reason to recall him. Barbara Walters: You were in the 1988 Olympics. You hit your head and there may have been blood in the water. - Mm-hmm. - Why were you terrified? Louganis: Because... I was HIV positive. Oprah Winfrey: So over the years, has the secret of being gay and HIV positive exhausted you? What now, Greg? Who knows? Who knows what's around the corner? ( barking ) ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Okay. Louganis: Everybody thinks that... I'm financially secure, and I'm not. They'll say, you know, "Oh, an Olympic gold medal is worth millions." You know, that's not the reality. That really isn't the reality. I feel like I've been coming from such a desperate place because, I mean, I, you know, haven't made a mortgage payment since October of 2010. I'm selling all of my belongings just to make ends meet. I put a lot of my stuff on auction. Meanwhile, I was trying to work with the bank to try to remodify my mortgage, but they told me that I had to default on the loan before they can sit down and talk with me. So I've been waiting and waiting and waiting. I've been in this house for 27 years. 27 years is a long time. That was the first thing that I really wanted to do, was have a home because that was a sense of security for me and it was a symbol of stability. ( clanging ) Louganis: When I first got here, I felt that house was very reflective of who I was because you drive onto the property, you're looking at a very modest one-story house. We walked around the back and it's like, "Oh, my God, there's a downstairs." I was like, "Okay, this is it. This is my dream house." So I do wanna do everything in my power to try and keep it. Announcer: Today, the Olympic flag is flying high. This is the last time our divers are going to be seeing that flag until they get to Montreal, Canada. We're going to see some really spectacular diving here today. And here is Greg Louganis. I've been working hard for this and this is my first Olympic trials and I hope I do well. Commentator: He's currently in first place. Can he keep it? Commentator #2: Oh, yeah, he'll get 10s all the way across. Commentator: We have seen something that we have not seen, I don't think, in 50 years, a man qualifying in both springboard and platform. And it is Greg Louganis, coached by the great Sammy Lee. He won two Olympic gold medals from the platform himself. You can't make a racehorse out of a jackass. You had a racehorse and all you had to do was get him on the starting block and he could do it. I was a member of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and they sent me to observe the Junior Olympics at the Air Force Academy. And I saw this 10-year-old boy diving. And I said, "There potentially is the greatest diver in the history of our sport if he wants to be." When Greg's father called me and asked whether I would coach his son, it was music to my ears. And he drove him up every weekend. With my dad, it was kind of a love-hate because there was a bit of a resentment because all of a sudden now he's interested. I was adopted when I was eight and a half months. My mom always showed me unconditional love. I knew that she loved me and she cared about me, but my dad was always rather standoffish to me. I always felt that there was a price on everything, especially the price on his love. I had a few tapes that played in my head growing up. You know, I was adopted. My real parents didn't want me. My skin was darker than the rest of the kids at my school. It was a regular occurrence getting beat up. I got called a lot of names-- nigger, sissy boy, faggot, retard. I had a very difficult time with reading and I found out later that I was dyslexic. I remember I turned to my mom and I said, "I can understand how a person can die of sadness." I mean, as a kid, you know, you just wanna be accepted. So when I was competing in diving, I had to be the best. I felt that it was the only thing that I had to offer. There were a lot of seconds and thirds. It made an Olympic gold medal that much more important. Commentator: Here is the boy who's excited everyone in Cleveland today-- Greg Louganis. He's just so beautiful. Even if he gets it wrong, he looks beautiful. - Do you think you can win the gold? - I don't know. I hope so. Well, if it isn't this time, it'll be sometime, I'm sure of that. Good luck. Lee: I invited him to live with me because I wanted him to beat Klaus Dibiasi of Italy. Commentator: Dibiasi is the current world champion and the platform dive gold medal winner in the last two Olympics. Lee: I wanted Greg to prevent Klaus Dibiasi from breaking my record of winning two consecutive gold medals. Commentator: I hope that he's in a semicoma and all he thinks about is the dive and not the significance of the championship. - ( whistle blows ) - Louganis: His dream became my dream. It was my coach's honor. And I was just such a kid, so I was trying not to embarrass myself. Commentator: Greg Louganis will lead the qualifiers. Keep in mind, however, all the scores prior to now are thrown out. They'll start over again and you will see all the 10 dives coming up. What everyone's looking forward to in the tower final here tomorrow night is the tussle between the 16-year-old American youth Louganis and 28-year-old defending champion Klaus Dibiasi. Commentator #2: Coming to you live right now with Greg Louganis. Commentator #3: Generally his best dive - and he's gonna have to do it here. - ( whistle blows ) - Commentator #3: Oh, way over! - ( crowd groans ) Commentator #2: I don't know what happened-- all of a sudden just before the entry. That cost him a gold medal. Commentator #3: It's just a shame that Greg couldn't do that dive the way he did it yesterday. Well, I was upset because I like to win. I don't like to lose. Commentator #2: Greg Louganis wins the silver, but the old veteran, Klaus Dibiasi, has made Olympic history tonight. Commentator #4: Greg Louganis... he's still waiting in the wings just a bit. Louganis: I went there to win and then when I fell short of that, I felt like a failure. Everybody else around me was celebrating. I was a sophomore in high school. I was thinking, "Who would ever understand me?" You know, what I was going through, what I was feeling. Interviewer: Do you know at one point that you're special? Do you know at one point that you're better than everybody else? When you came back to school after Montreal, did the kids, the classmates, tell you how good you were? No, I think I got the reverse. You know, all these big, macho football players and all, I was taking some of the limelight from them. And, you know, they resented that. They didn't like that one bit, so, you know, I'm just... It was-- it was rough. It was rough. Louganis: The focus is just, you know, trying-- trying to make ends meet. I'm thinking, "Get a job, get a job, get a job." I do have to make a living. After I retired from diving, I did exhibitions, I did commercials, speaking engagements, personal appearances and then got into acting. Sometimes you have a real good month. Sometimes you have nothing. You know? And I've lived through the nothings a lot. The reason why I got the RV a few years ago was because we were preparing for the worst. We thought the banks would be acting a lot faster, you know, in the foreclosure process. It's hard to find a place with four dogs. So, at least we can live in the RV. I don't know that I-- that I wanna live out of my RV, but, you know, at least it's there. You know, just looking for opportunities. ( chatter ) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, a big Boston welcome - for Greg Louganis! - ( crowd cheering, applauding ) Folks, we will remind you guys again, we're so happy that you've joined us out here for this, the Red Bull cliff diving event in Boston. Announcer: Fine, solid entry on that one. And let's see what the judges are liking. And, yeah, they do like it. Seven and a halfs and eights. - But are you guys having a great time? - ( crowd cheering ) - Are you guys having a great time? - Man: Yes! Louganis: The show must go on. Even though there was a lot of personal turmoil that was going on, you know, I do my job. And that's to be on and in front of all these people. Red Bull is paying me for, you know, judging and being there to meet and greet the fans. - Can I have an autograph, please? - Sure. What's your name? - Julian. - Julian. Louganis: In your mind you're contemplating, "Okay, now what's my next step?" - You're a great American. Always been a fan of yours. - Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, thanks. Would it be possible to get you to say, "Good luck to Boston Area Divers" with the Boston skyline in the back? Or is that too much? Louganis: It is interesting because after 25 years, they still remember. But, you know, for all of these years, I didn't feel welcome in diving, you know, whether it be jealousies or whatever it was... homophobia-- I don't know. I retired from diving when I was 28. Making that transition, you know, was tough. I think the thing that I miss most in diving is the regularity of a schedule and that devotion to being physically active. And also not having to think, you know, because my coach was telling me what I needed to do. Real life doesn't work that way. Louganis: I'd just like to see more and more young people get involved in diving as a sport. The important thing is be careful, be cautious. Whenever you're diving, you should always know how deep it is. The kind of competitive diving I do requires years of training under the supervision of a great coach like Ron O'Brien. Woman: Wow, what kind of stamina does it take to go off this repeatedly? I mean, the pounding must be terrific on the body. - Well, it is hard. - Yeah. You hit the water at about 32 miles an hour. And at that speed it can be pretty punishing. Louganis: When I first went to him, he was the god of diving. You know, I worshipped him. Ron is-- is the one who got me. He knew that I was a performer. When I knew that I was in good shape, he'd say, "Just keep dancing." It's like, "Okay, doing pretty good, so, you know, just gotta keep the flow going." O'Brien: I've never had a diver with the amount of natural ability - that Greg has. - ( whistle blows ) It's his body build, which is very straight and symmetrical. It's his strength and power. He is able to create the illusion that what he's doing has no effort to it whatsoever. I could've stood on the poolside and said, "Nice dive, nice dive, good dive, nice dive" all day long because they all were. So I realized that I had to demand a little more from him than I did from the others. Louganis: He knew that I needed to be challenged and he was creative enough to figure out how he could challenge me. Not just medals, not just national titles. He started challenging me with performance goals. I was so excited about, you know, "gosh, breaking 700 on 10 meter platform." O'Brien: I tried to coach him not to do good dives or very good dives, but to do as close to perfect as you can get. Announcer: Look at this. Greg Louganis scores perfect 10s. Announcer #2: And in first place, from Mission Viejo, - Mr. Greg Louganis... - ( cheering, applause ) ...coached by Ron O'Brien. Interviewer: It's a year later now and a year closer to the Olympic Games. May I add a little pressure and tell you we're all looking forward to you winning the Olympic gold? - I'm sorry. - ( laughs ) Sure. - Good luck. - Thank you very much. O'Brien: By 1980 at the Olympic trials, Greg won both springboard and the platform and was prepared to collect the gold medal that he didn't get in 1976. And then, as most everybody knows, the Russians invaded Afghanistan. And I have notified the Olympic Committee that with Soviet invading forces in Afghanistan, neither the American people nor I will support sending an Olympic team to Moscow. O'Brien: A hot dog on the White House lawn and a handshake from President Carter didn't quite do it because he did-- he did want that gold medal around his neck. In retrospect, I feel the athletes really got cheated. Louganis: Had I gone in 1980, had I been successful, I probably would've moved on. Diving was something I was good at. It wasn't something I was particularly enjoying at the time. Greg, that last one was really good, but if you want a chance to get 10s on that dive, you're gonna have to get your right arm up a little higher... O'Brien: Excellence is such an obsessive pursuit of a goal... - All right. - ...that it transcends everything else in life. Louganis: It was a strange time for me. I became much more introverted and I directed all my time and energy into diving. And I think that enabled me to become the best. I think it was a hindrance as far as being able to relate to other people because I didn't take an interest. O'Brien: In a sport like diving, you can feel pretty isolated and alone. You're out there in this little Speedo. You can't say, "Well, he didn't pass me the ball" or whatever. It's totally up to you. So when you have somebody that you trust, that you can-- you can lean on... it helps to diffuse that feeling of isolation. ( chatter ) Greg Louganis captured America's attention in the 1980s with his picture-perfect dives and good looks. Since the Seoul games in 1988, he has largely remained out of the diving spotlight. - Male anchor: But he's back. - Reporter: Yes, he is back. The Southern Californian many call the best diver ever has joined USA Diving as a mentor. - We're excited. We've got London and... - Yeah. - And now you know what to do. - Yeah. He's a good businessman. When Steve Foley became high performance director of USA Diving, he came to the house and he said, "How do we get you back involved in diving?" And I, like, looked at him and I said, "Ask." And he said, "You've never been asked?" I said, "No, nor have I felt welcome." ( chatter ) Steve said that he can't do anything... about the past, but we can move forward. So then we started talking about what I had to offer. And what we came up with was mentoring. So I have taken that chance of putting myself back involved in diving, sharing my experience, sharing what I learned. Foley: Greg lets them know everything-- how to think about performance, not outcomes. And it's actually a great key to success, we hope, for the future of our Olympic divers. - Man: Three. - Foley: Who better than the greatest of all time to give us his wisdom? I don't see things oftentimes the same way a coach would see it. When it comes down to it, it's really not about numbers. - Like, it's that moment in time, you know? - Nick McCrory: Yeah. I was just wondering 'cause, you know, you learn how to deal with the scope and everything. You deserve to be there. Yeah, you really have to step into it and own it and say, "You know what? Today is my day and I'm here, present, and it'll be what it'll be." Louganis: It'll come to you. I'm making a lot of changes, which is making it hard, - but I don't wanna give-- - You wanna learn everything, like, now, okay? But you learn in layers, and then comes another layer, and then comes another layer. I mean, that's how we learn. I remember back at the last Olympic we didn't have Greg at all involved with diving. I think it kind of hindered it. It definitely helps every single diver because of the experience that he brings from his past. Louganis: Olympians aren't made overnight. That was what my life was and what I was dedicated to. When I was growing up, you know, I asked my mom, you know, "Why can't I be normal?" ( chuckles ) You know, like, do-- do the things that normal kids do. You know, it's-- it's lonely. You miss out on a lot. You know, I'm having my doubts. I don't know if it-- if it was really all worth it. O'Brien: You know, my concern through the whole period of time was that I knew he was gonna quit diving sometime and he's got life after diving. And I wanted him to go out of the sport with some-- with values and feel good about himself. I made a commitment to him to help him out. So I-- I started to get into his moods... say, "What's the matter, Greg?" "Nothing. Nothing." Louganis: I might be described as moody during, you know, those years because I would withdraw and I wouldn't-- I couldn't articulate what I was going through. During that time, I mean, I was in denial of my sexuality. Back in '76, I was hanging out with Soviet divers because they were closer to my age. It wasn't really anything. It may have been a little bit more than that, but, you know, 'cause I was kind of attracted to one of the Soviet divers. But some of my teammates were calling me the Commie fag. It was a small team and so nobody wanted to room with the fag. Kent Ferguson: I remember kind of sitting in one of those meetings and people going, "Well... you know, I'm not gonna room with Greg" or whatever. I was just like, "Screw it, you guys. Are you kidding me? - Come on. Whatever." - Yeah. And then I think that's when you and I started rooming together - more and more and just... - Louganis: Yeah. - Yeah. - Ferguson: That was totally-- BTF Club. Remember, it was the BTF Club, which is the Beat the Fag Club. - Beat the Fag Club. - Oh, my gosh, I do remember that, yeah. Ferguson: I remember coming out of our dorm rooms and you're looking at the doors and seeing these signs-- BTF Club, BTF Club all the way through. And you're like, "That's Beat the Fag Club." Yeah. And just thinking, "God, if this is what being gay is about and, you know, the-- the best diver in the world is going through all this and I'm just me, what's gonna happen to me, you know? You know, it's that whole thing. You were at the top. And people do whatever they do to, you know, try to-- Well, if they can't beat you on the boards, they try and beat you off the boards. Exactly, but, you know-- I know it's all speculation, but had I come out while I was diving, I think in the media I would have been the gay athlete, the gay diver, you know? And that would be the headline. But the truth of it is, is, like, you're a diver, you're, you know-- you're a son, - you're-- it's a part of who we are. - Yeah. - You know? - It's-- yeah, and just a part. Who you love is who you love. You know, you're here, you're gonna dive, you're gonna compete and this is what you do, but-- - It'll be nice when it's a nonissue. - Clark: Yeah. ( conversation continues indistinctly ) Louganis: At that time, everybody in the diving world knew about my sexual orientation. But, I mean, it wasn't without-- you know, like the names that they called Ron's team-- Mission Gay, Fort Lauderdale Flamers, you know, that sort of thing. O'Brien: My feeling was you don't choose to be gay, you're gay. I don't choose to be heterosexual, I'm heterosexual. The first time I met Jim, I think it was at a bar. I think it was the Boom Boom Room or something like that. He could be quite charming. I think initially, I was relieved in a way, excited that this guy found me attractive. I enjoyed the affection that I was starved for. I mean, I also realized that if you don't trust anyone, then you might as well lock yourself up in the house because, I mean, you'll spend the rest of your life alone. Reporter: Once, Greg had almost tunnel vision about dedication to his sport. Now friends like Michele Mitchell and Jim Babbitt mean more. Louganis: I was out to my family and friends, you know? It was just my policy not to discuss my sexuality with members of the media. So would you welcome Greg Louganis and Dr. Ron O'Brien. - ( applause ) - Johnny Carson: Greg, it's good to meet ya. You are just incredible to watch. You must have started when you were how young? - Well, I started tumbling when I was a year and a half. - Right. And then got into dance. - A year and a half, did you say? - Yeah. Ah. That's the time to start, I guess. The training has changed a lot, hasn't it, Ron? Yeah, it has, Johnny. A diver will do a dive 50 or 60 times in dry-land training before doing it in the pool the first time. Let's start with a forward two and a half pike. - ( applause ) - And you're looking forward to the 1984 Olympics? - Yep. - I don't know how you can miss. Congratulations. You're just sensational. Ron, thanks for being here. Before we get on with the competition, we must report on a tragic event that occurred after we went off the air here yesterday. A 21-year-old diver from the Soviet Union, Sergei Salibashvili, fractured his skull after hitting his head on the platform during a dive in yesterday's preliminary competition. What about the dive he was attempting, that reverse three and a half? Well, this one was just added to the international table of dives and people like Greg Louganis do it and can do it well. So the Soviet diver, in order to attempt to compete with Greg, is trying to use it and he's really not ready to. Louganis: You know, I just felt responsible. We were the only two doing that dive. O'Brien: That's probably the hardest dive he ever learned. He had to see that he couldn't reach the goals that he was trying to reach unless he did the dive that gave him the motivation to overcome the fear and do it. He had a little signal he would give me when he was nervous. Divers all use a shammy-- a little thing like this and it takes the water off. If he was a little nervous, he would roll his shammy up a certain way and come over before his first dive and give it to me to hold for him. That was my signal to spend a little more time with him in between dives, tell him some-- maybe a dirty joke or something to make him laugh, keep his mind occupied. And that worked for us. Female commentator: This is the most difficult dive that can be performed off the 10 meter platform. - Commentator: Oh, wow! - Female commentator: Oh, my goodness! That was absolutely gorgeous. Commentator: Standing ovation for Greg Louganis. Final dive in these Olympic trials. Louganis: With the help of Ron, you know, I realized that, you know what, this-- I really like this. You know, I'm good at it, but I also really like it. Female commentator: Greg now being on the team has a chance to win a gold medal in both of those events in the Olympics. ( cheering, applause ) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, a salute to the nations of the 23rd Olympiad. O'Brien: The Olympic stage is unlike anything else. Commentator: Look at the crowd here. They love it. O'Brien: And Greg was at his peak. Commentator: Now the man, Greg Louganis, a back dive pike position. Let's see just how good this young man is. - ( cheering, applause ) - ( commentator laughs ) - Whoo! - Female commentator: He looked like ballet in air. Commentator: Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my. - Female commentator: That was a gorgeous dive. - ( cheering, applause ) - Commentator: You are watching perfection, ladies and gentlemen. Louganis: Everything was working so well. And I was able to open the blinders up, take everything in, and utilize that exhilaration. Commentator: Ha! Female commentator: It doesn't look too tough when Greg does it. Commentator: Greg Louganis wins his first gold medal at an Olympics. Louganis: It was eight years before I had a chance to prove myself to win my first gold medal. And I don't think it hit until after the platform, you know, because I didn't wanna let up because I wanted two gold medals. - Announcer: Greg Louganis... - Commentator: He's trying to become the first man since 1928 to win gold medals - in springboard and platform. - ( whistle blows ) Female commentator: You saw that beautiful swan dive position right off the tower. When he dove on the 10 meter platform, I feel that that was his greatest performance. I thought you stood up too straight, but it didn't matter, you were so damn high. I felt that he set the standard at that point for the rest of the world that if you're gonna do the hard dives, you have to do them with grace and beauty. Commentator: And now to the man, his last dive in these Olympics. He needs 81.92 to break 700 points. Nobody's ever done that. That is the Mount Everest of this sport. ( whistle blows ) Louganis: You don't know why, you don't know where it's coming from, you don't know the motivation behind it, that a performance in diving is and should be as emotional as any incredibly written play. ( cheering, applause ) O'Brien: 700! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Commentator: He did it! He did it! Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, the results are official. Number one, Greg Louganis, United States-- 710.91 points. Commentator: Greg Louganis, scoring more points than any man has ever scored before, gets the gold. Female commentator: He could be the greatest diver ever to dive. O'Brien: After the 1984 Olympic Games, he had just won two gold medals. First man to do that since 1928. He was a big name. - ( crowd cheering ) - How you doing? Real good. - Two gold? - Yep. This gentleman, when he gets up to dive, - I think he's been made by Mattel. - ( applause ) Man: I've never seen anything that exciting on my television screen before or probably ever will again. - We all wish you well. - Thanks. O'Brien: I thought that he would gain financially and unfortunately, it didn't happen. In the advertising world as in the Olympics, not everyone gets the gold. - ( crowd cheering ) - Man: Mary Lou, how do you do? Just fine, thank you. Retton signed 15 big endorsement deals, among them Wheaties and McDonald's. This year, the Olympic pixie will make a king-sized million dollars plus. - Why Mary Lou? - Are you kidding? She's adorable. I mean, she's cuter than a teddy bear. I'm not the cutesy Mary Lou Retton. I think that that's wonderful for her and it works for her, but it wouldn't work for me. Louganis: Ooh. - Very young. ( laughs ) - Yeah. That must have been like when I was 15 or something. And that was here at the Swimming Hall of Fame, I think. Yeah. Wow. That was so sweet. Yeah, never got a Wheaties box. ( laughs ) Their response was that I didn't fit their "wholesome"... demographics or whatever. Basically, you know, being gay or being rumored that I was gay. I do think had he been a straight athlete, he would have made millions. - ( chatter ) - Woman: Oh, Greg Louganis! Oh, my God! - Hi! Oh, my gosh. - You're my hero. I love you! - I watched every dive my whole life. - Oh, thank you, thank you. - Oh, he's so terrific! - Thank you. Announcer: Please welcome to the stage Miss Shannon Miller... - Mr. Carl Lewis... - ( crowd cheers ) Mr. Greg Louganis. Louganis: This is a very real way that you can give to the Olympic athletes. And we all know what they're going through right now. The Olympics have been part of all of us for our lives because once an Olympian, you're always an Olympian. So it's really exciting to be back here with all of you. Hi, I'm Greg Louganis and we're gonna be talking about mentoring the next generation of athletes. Ultimately, my passion is the aftercare. What happens to the athletes, you know, whether they're successful or not successful. What happens to them? Where do they go? How do they reacclimate into society? They dedicated their entire lives to their sport and then what? So many of our Olympic heroes, they fall through the cracks, you know? Speedy committed suicide last year. We lost Mark Lenzi, you know, just recently. Because I've had my issues, too, you know? Trusting the wrong people and not-- not knowing the questions to ask. Louganis: Because I didn't have the normal socialization that most children have. You know, I was usually just given a schedule. "This is what you're doing today." And I'm now 52 and looking to grow up. This is a big deal today. Louganis: With an Olympian-to-Olympian mentoring program, you can share what your journey was with these young athletes. Let them know that they're not alone. Just give them some support. And also, I mean, I'd love for them to not make some of the decisions that I've made in my life, you know, to save them some of that heartache. Louganis: I always had in mind for the house-- I wanted to, you know, get solar. I wanted to make it energy efficient. And then I was introduced to this one contractor. She came in and basically said, "Oh, you've got black mold. That's the reason why you've been having all these health issues." You know, and I was. I was terrified. With a compromised immune system, it was a life or death situation. You know, I believed her, I trusted her, and they pushed the loan through. They kind of took all of the equity out of my house. I mean, the place was half demolished because she said the work had to be done immediately. You know, as it turned out, it was a scam. I never saw the money. And then I was paying on the loan. O'Brien: Being in the limelight like he was and being a nice guy with a good heart and whatever, he was vulnerable to people taking advantage of him. Louganis: I had become accustomed to pushing all the problems aside. At the time, Jim was also my business manager. He was my eyes and ears to the world. He wanted to control every aspect of my life and he did and I allowed him to. And then '84 happened and two-- win two gold medals. I mean, I think he saw me as his meal ticket. O'Brien: I thought Jim was a user and he was a-- kind of, you know, a con man. He had a story for every situation and a situation for every story. Louganis: You know, diving was an escape from reality. ( man speaking Spanish ) Louganis: I would go to a world championships and come back and... an atomic bomb could've gone off and I wouldn't have known it. ( crowd chanting ) Talk about AIDS! Talk about AIDS! Talk about AIDS! Reporter: Since it was first recognized in June 1981, the incidence of AIDS has doubled every six months. The diagnosis always fatal. Reporter #2: There is no known cure and every day four to five new cases are discovered. Reporter #3: And most frightening, the possibility that the virus can be transmitted from person to person, virtually a contagious form of cancer. Protestors: Educate, don't isolate! Reporter #4: That's why today police used gloves while arresting gay demonstrators. Reporter #5: Nearly one out of seven people polled said they would favor tattooing all AIDS victims and better than half said they should be quarantined. Louganis: I was still with Jim at the time. Jim called me and was having difficulty breathing, so he checked himself into the hospital. He had full-blown AIDS. So I went in and got tested. Louganis: It was an Olympic year. It was a very important year. And-- and that was it. I was gonna pack up and go home. I didn't wanna jeopardize anybody else, and if I'm unable to compete, that's two people that I would be preventing from the ability to go to the Olympics. It was several weeks past before I said anything to Ron. He knew something was wrong, and so after a workout he asked me what was going on, what was wrong. And... I told him that I was tested and I was positive. O'Brien: He just blurted it out. My thought was, "What does that mean? Where do we go from here? Is this the end of the line?" Louganis: He didn't wanna show that-- how scared he was to me. And then came over and he held me. And he said we'll get through this together. Louganis: I heard about, you know, the demonstrations and the arrests and ACT UP. I-- I trained through all of that. You know, I wasn't an activist. You know, I was just this athlete who had Olympic dreams. It was a very, very, very small group of people who were in on the secret. They encouraged me that the healthiest thing for me was to continue training. Reporter: An AIDS cure is 15 years away, but this week the first real hope for containing the disease began arriving at hospitals-- AZT. They wanted to treat me very aggressively, so they put me on AZT right away. O'Brien: He had to take medicine every four hours, so he was not able to sleep through the night. Louganis: AZT is an incredibly toxic drug, but I knew I had-- I had to take it, you know, that's what my doctor said. Louganis: There was a lot of things that were going on behind the scenes of that whole entire experience. '88 began my true love affair with this sport, you know, because I loved it. I loved going to training, I loved going-- doing the work because I didn't think I would live. And so, you know, for me to be here today you know, 20 some-odd years later and be able to talk to you and share these stories, I mean, is just such a blessing to me. You don't achieve greatness on your own and you can lean on people. Don't be afraid to ask for help. You know, and that's what-- I wanna be there for you, you know? Hopefully, you know? I wanna be there for you. He emphasized that he didn't want me to train him any differently. He knew the cards were stacked against him. Louganis: The Chinese had caught up to me by that time. I knew I was gonna be hard-pressed, you know, to be successful in '88. O'Brien: The only way to be remembered in history 40 or 50 years from now as being the ultimate, the greatest is the record you leave. Louganis: Talk about having your back, you know? As a coach, he smuggled my HIV meds into Seoul just in case. I wouldn't have been allowed in the country had anybody known my HIV status. Commentator: Preliminaries of the men's three meter springboard in Chamshil Indoor Swimming Pool. Louganis: I always have wanted my record to speak for itself. O'Brien: Expectations put pressure on you before you even do anything. Female announcer: Greg Louganis, 053. A reverse two and one half somersault tuck. 3.0. Commentator: And now Greg Louganis. - ( thuds ) - ( crowd gasps ) Commentator #2: Louganis hits the board. That is disaster. Louganis: I just held my head. But I just wanted to hold the blood in or, you know, just not anybody touch it. O'Brien: Honestly, I never thought about HIV. I guess I was just so focused on getting him through... helping him to win his two gold medals. That was my focus. I said, "Do you wanna continue?" He said we worked too long and too hard to not continue. "How much time do we have?" "We got about 12 minutes till you gotta do your next dive." O'Brien: "How much time do we have?" "Oh, about six, seven minutes." Louganis: Once I hit the board, any ounce of confidence that I had was gone. O'Brien: Greg, if you can't believe in yourself, at least believe in me. Put your faith in me and I'll help you. Commentator #3: Fives or better, he will make it into the finals. Threes or less in his last two dives, he would not make it into the 12. - ( cheering, applause ) - Female announcer: Greg Louganis. ( speaking Korean ) Commentator: Yes! Commentator #4: What an athlete! He got the highest scores on that dive of anybody in the contest that day or the next day. It was just an error in judgment. Female reporter: Are you feeling okay? I'm just concentrating on tomorrow. Female reporter: How do you get up there and do it again after that? Louganis: I kept playing the dive over and over in my head... trying to figure out what I had done wrong. I didn't know what my responsibility was because I knew I was HIV positive. The people on the pool deck, the-- you know, the coaches, the doctor who sewed me up. He stitched my head up without surgical gloves. The blood that was in the pool, the blood that might've spilled onto the deck. And then the alarm goes off. I have to take my medicine. - I didn't sleep. - ( crowd cheering ) Commentator: We are back for the finals of the men's springboard competition. O'Brien: I just had to kind of kick his butt a little bit right then and say, "God damn it, it was a fluke. You can do this dive. Don't let it get to you." Commentator: We are now in the 11th and final round. Greg Louganis has one more dive. Female announcer: 307C. - A reverse three and one-half somersault tuck. - ( whistle blows ) Commentator: The courageous American Greg Louganis won his second gold medal in springboard diving, a great comeback a day after he hit his head on the board. Female announcer: The gold medalist and Olympic champion-- Greg Louganis of the United States of America. ( speaking Korean ) Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, our standing at the end of round is nine. Female announcer: Leading-- Xiong Ni, Greg Louganis... Commentator #2: He has his opportunity to go in the record book as the very best diver who ever lived. - ( whistle blows ) - Commentator: Louganis in second place, the final dive of his competition, his last chance. ( crowd applauds ) Commentator: He needed 85.6. He earned 86.7. ( cheering ) O'Brien: Whoo! Whoo! You did it, buddy! Oh, buddy. That's a hell of a way to do it. Remember, Klaus had to do it on his last dive to beat you. ( laughs ) - Man: You did it! - O'Brien: In those moments, I looked at where he came from... and where he was. And I was proud to be a part of that. I was put on this earth to do something in diving and I did it. This was what I was supposed to do. Louganis: I knew in my heart that those were my last competitive dives. You know, it's over. Louganis: After '88, I wasn't paying attention to what my financial position was. I had heard rumors about... you know, things that Jim was doing. I learned that I had $2,000 to my name. Everything else was held in his name and he had power of attorney, so he could do, you know, basically whatever he wanted. It had gotten to a point where Jim said if I got rid of him, then he was gonna destroy me. That he was gonna take me to hell with him. He threatened to, you know, sell my story, he was gonna kill me, he was gonna blow my fucking brains out. Tell the world that you infected me with AIDS. So... it did take a lot of courage. Female reporter: It is 10 years since reports started emerging in the United States that a new disease appeared to be spreading. Female reporter #2: 100 Americans are dying every single day. Louganis: We thought HIV is a death sentence. There wasn't a whole lot of hope for a lot of people at that time because people were dying right and left. At times, there was some guilt over that. You know, it's like, well, I'm getting probably the best treatment that anybody could ask for or that was available at the time. There was one scare in '93. I had lost a lot of weight. I knew that that was a definite possibility that that was it. I had my 33rd birthday because I thought I was saying goodbye to everybody. ( people cheering ) ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪ Louganis: Very few of the people who were invited knew the significance or what I thought the significance was. 'Cause that's when I came out to my mom about my HIV status. Frances Louganis: It hurts. I can't do anything. I've thought about it every day since. Eric Marcus: Mrs. Louganis, just for the tape, if you can just identify yourself with your full name. Frances: Oh, I'm Frances Louganis, Greg Louganis's mom. Marcus: And, Greg, just to have a sound check on you. Louganis: I'm Greg Louganis. Marcus: February 2nd, 1994. Interviewer is Eric Marcus. Frances: Are you gonna put all this in the book? Louganis: Yeah. Frances: So you are gonna come out in the book that you are gay? Louganis: Mm-hmm. Frances: What type of reaction do you think you're gonna get, son? Louganis: Um... Honestly, I don't know. - Frances: Do you care? - Louganis: No. Marcus: What's changed for you, that you don't want to continue hiding? Louganis: You know, AIDS is indiscriminate. I mean, I've taken notice of all the breaking news. Like, Arthur Ashe was in the hospital and then Magic Johnson. But the fact of the matter is... has anybody come out and said, "I'm gay and I'm HIV positive" or "I'm gay and I have AIDS"? No. Frances: It's too risky. I don't want to have to see him sell his home, his one and only home that he's loved, you know, because of this book. Louganis: I don't know how much time I have. I realized how important it is to do this now because I want-- I wanna see it done. My name is Greg Louganis. I'm gay and I'm HIV positive. A man considered to be the greatest diver in Olympic history has announced today that he has AIDS. Reporter: If it had been almost any other disease, everyone would be talking about his courage. But it was the AIDS virus and it was the dive Louganis missed on his way to that medal that everyone's talking about now. Walters: We checked with the International Olympic Committee and they said that Greg was under no obligation to divulge his secret even after he hit his head on the board. Would it have been this complicated, say, if you were not this, you know, the greatest diver of all times in the history of the world since there ever was a diving board? I had every expectation that if I went public with the fact that I'm gay that no one would want to hire me and that I would lose my house. How would a smart guy like you practice unsafe sex? I... I'm not following. How'd you get AIDS? I'm sure I was probably exposed before they knew about unsafe sex. Larry King: Oh, so you're pretty sure of that? - Yeah. - Do you feel in yourself that you might live a long while? Yeah, I think so. - I hope so. - You're confident. Think or hope is a different thing. Are you confident that you will? Louganis: Uh... who knows? You know, the shame, the guilt, you know, all of this stuff that I was feeling, I knew, you know, if I were going through that, that I probably wasn't the only one, that, you know, there were probably others out there. I just didn't know that there were that many. Man on bullhorn: Folks, we wanna make sure that everyone that's in line has already picked up their copy of the book. Female reporter: Parking lot was awash in a sea of umbrellas today. Hundreds stood in the rain for hours just for the chance to see Louganis. I mean, he could've just kept his HIV status to himself, but he came out telling it like it is. Woman: He's done something not a lot of people have the courage to do and I'm out here to support him. Female reporter: "Breaking the Surface" sold out about half an hour after hitting shelves. The Greg Louganis story seems to have struck a nerve with people gay and straight. They say if Greg Louganis has the courage to do this, so do they. ( reporters clamoring ) Man: Greg, to your right, Greg. Man #2: Greg, in the corner, please, Greg. AIDS, it's here. It's not gone away. It's not "manageable." - There's a lot of hope here tonight. - There's a lot of hope. Do you feel a lot of hope in this fight against AIDS? The biggest hope is to find a cure. You know, that's-- that's the goal. And finally, where do you watch the Olympics? Do you go to the Olympics? Or how does that work? Well, this time-- this time-- I haven't been to an Olympics since Atlanta. And I'm gonna be in London, I'm gonna be working with the athletes and the coaches as athlete mentor. - So it's really exciting. - That's so great. - Well, I'll be watching. Thank you so much. - Great, great. It was such a pleasure to meet you. Have a great night. Thank you. Thanks. Louganis: I mean, had I been heterosexual, two and a half kids, you know, HIV negative, I'm sure life would have been very different, you know, for-- you know, for me. Supposed to take this... I'm not the easiest person to have a relationship with because it seems that oftentimes people that I've been involved with kind of get lost in my stuff. With Johnny, he has his own life. He has his own interests and he has his own passions. I used to bring the Danes down here. Johnny Chaillot: All five of them? And I was like, "Oh, he's handsome." Chaillot: The first profile that came up was Greg Louganis kissing a dolphin. It was like, "I'm not contacting Greg Louganis. That's ridiculous." Louganis: And I, like, winked at him or something and then he responded back and then, you know, he said, well, you know, let's-- let's get together. It just felt, you know, so comfortable and so right. Chaillot: As I got to know him, I realized that... he's just like everybody else, he just played his life out on the world stage. Louganis: I don't have to be on all the time. There's a comfort with that, you know, and a confidence with that. ( both laughing ) Louganis: I love his attitude. Every morning we wake up, it's like, "I wonder what the universe has in store for us today?" ( phone line ringing ) Recording: Thank you for calling Bank of America. We are a debt collector. Your call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance. Woman: This is Joselyn with Loan Servicing and just keep in mind you do have the right to designate a certified counselor, advisor, or attorney to represent you. Louganis: I mean, I just got notice last week. I mean, I knew this day would come. I, you know-- I had no doubt. You know, and financial-- my financial position has changed a bit. And, you know, potentially, they might consider a remodification. I don't know. Joselyn: Right, and this is where you would get prequalified for it if you can even do a modification. If you qualify, then we'll send it over for a case manager. If not, you would have to come up with the full reinstatement amount, otherwise the home will be sold on the 22nd. I don't have a lot of options here, do I? Joselyn: No, there aren't many options to you. Louganis: If the auction goes through, they can take immediate occupancy of the residence, so I have to be ready to have everything that I want out of the house. We're doing the yes or no for this-- - this area right here. - Okay. Actually, I mean, I think all of this stuff I've already been through once... - Uh-huh. - ...and this is what I wanna keep. Oh, okay, good. That's super easy. You wanna keep your moose? What about Scooby-Doo and, um... - Scooby-Doo is kind of special. - Okay. Louganis: I'm paralyzed because I don't know what to do. That's what the situation is right now. It's like kind of crunch time before I leave the country. I mean, I did have Johnny to get boxes boxed and, you know, movers were coming. I really appreciate that. I owe him big time on that one. Flight attendant on P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a fast-track voucher, after descent from this aircraft, please follow the fast-track signs on the entry of the immigration hall... - Interviewer: Greg, good morning. - Good morning. A pleasure to have you with us. The greatest diver in Olympic history. And this, of course, is the first time since, what, '96 - that you've been to an Olympic Games? - Yeah! So you've obviously made up with the United States Diving Federation. And you have publicly blamed homophobia in the sport as one of the reasons why you stayed away. Do you think that we've made some progress there? Oh, definitely, we've made tremendous progress. I mean, that's the reason why I'm back. Now, he was brought on, the first person to be doing this, as a mentor for the US diving team. I'm working with the athletes in preparation, but I'll also work with them, what's going on outside of the pool. It's all connected. It really is. It's all connected. There's been such a radical change now in public opinion about HIV precisely because of people like you. You know, that was pretty scary. You know, I didn't know how people were gonna react. Piers Morgan: What do you make of where you've got to now? Are you in a-- in a good place now? You-- have you come through all the traumas and dramas of what went on? Yeah, definitely. I mean, 'cause back in 1988, honestly, I didn't think that I'd see 30. I've been averaging two to three interviews a day. - Closer to five. - Closer to five? Five interviews a day. Yikes. It's amazing. When I saw Greg on Piers Morgan and CNN at the London Games, I really felt inspired because people living with HIV are still people. People like Greg have proven that HIV does not have to stop you. And HIV is not gonna stop me. You know, you do interviews and you spout off crap and you just never know what's gonna land, you know, what people are gonna hear, how they're gonna react. You know, but when I read that, it was like... just couldn't believe it. I just try and, you know, do what's right for me. You know, and you do what's right for you first and a lot of times the by-product of that can have a positive effect. - ( chatter ) - Chaillot: Greg! Louganis! Chaillot: He called me and I heard in his voice that he was tired and it's like I know I can help him. I'm going to the Olympics and I'm gonna find him. And they were like, "There are 300,000 people at the Olympics." It's like, "I'm gonna find him." And here we are. You know? - Here you go. - Okay. ( chuckles ) Oh, God. - How long do I have? Oh. - 30 minutes. Okay. Commentator: No American has won this 10 meter platform event since the great Greg Louganis in '88 in Seoul. David Boudia, 23-year-old from Abilene in Texas. Commentator #2: He is one dive from a gold medal. Female commentator: You're looking for 90 points. He's gonna be close. - ( crowd cheering ) - ( mouths word ) - Female commentator: Yes! - Commentator: And David Boudia has won gold! I saw a difference in the demeanor of the divers and the coaches in that they were more relaxed and we ended up with four medals, which is the best we've done in a long time. It was shocking and amazing. I'm just so happy that we won. Commentator #2: Boudia becomes the first American male diver to win a solo diving gold in the 10 meter platform since Greg Louganis. Louganis: God, I never would've thought of myself as an ambassador to anything, but, you know, to be put in that position, mentoring has really opened my eyes to realize that, yeah, I do have something to offer, you know? ( chatter ) Louganis: I know when I was younger, I wanted a home. That was something that was very important to me because then I felt like I had roots. But after all of the events that have happened thus far in my life, I realize, you know, my home is where I make it. 10 years ago, I would've just run and just not wanna-- wanna deal with it. But, you know, I realized I need to take more control. And so we were able to get our loan modification that I can live with. It doesn't address getting the house fixed up, but one hurdle at a time, one step at a time. ( chatter ) - O'Brien: You going down here? - I've been wanting to do this for a long time. Have a seat. Yeah, Mary Jane, come on. My wife-- she doesn't wanna talk, but that's all she does. - She always talks. - I know. Louganis: I was asked what I felt my most shining moment of my diving career was and I'd have to say men's platform 1984. Mm, I agree. You were 100%. - I couldn't have done it without you. - Thank you. So I wanted to present you the medal. - Mary Jane: Wow! - Wow. Thanks, Greg. Louganis: It was a shining moment when we were, like, so together and in sync. - It was great. - Yeah. - Thank you, Greg. - Yeah. ( sniffles ) - We had a great run, didn't we? - We did. - Yep. Yep. - 10 years. - 10 great years. - Yeah. Yeah. ( clangs ) O'Brien: Over time, he reinvented himself. I'm proud of that accomplishment as much as I am of his diving because he made himself into a new person. ( crowd cheering ) Female reporter: Now holding hands, kissing, waving the rainbow flag, any of those could get gays and lesbians and their supporters sent to jail in Russia. Female reporter #2: Putin signed a measure in June banning public expression of homosexual identity. ( crowd chanting ) Gay rights for Russia! Female reporter #2: Some opponents of the laws are urging a boycott of the Winter Olympics set for February in the Russian city of Sochi. Interviewer: Greg, it's great to have you on. So what's the right way for people gay and straight in this country to say, "We don't like your-- your stupid law"? Boycotts hurt the wrong people. Cooper: So you wouldn't try to make some sort of statement - while competing? - Louganis: Oh, I probably would. - I'd get a rainbow Speedo. - Get a rainbow Speedo. Same sex marriage supporters around the country are celebrating two big decisions this week by the US Supreme Court. Louganis: The one fear that my mom always had for me is that I would have to spend my life alone as a gay man. And now that has changed. Our parents are no longer with us, but I have found my soul mate. I mean, it's-- it really is inevitable that we're together. - Greg Louganis, Johnny Chaillot... - Thank you. - ...congratulations on your engagement. - Thank you. I've always said again and again and again I'm not political, I'm not political, I'm not political. I kept all of those worlds separate-- my sexual identity, diving, but now I-- I see the connection. I view it more as just being myself. I'm a gay man living with HIV and... who is not afraid to stand up and speak out. ( music playing ) I now pronounce you husbands legally married in the great state of California. - You may kiss your grooms. - ( cheering, applause ) ( music playing ) Announcer: This has been a presentation of HBO Sports.
