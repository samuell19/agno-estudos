Mom, you'll hardly miss me at Thanksgiving. Dad will be busy at the store and I'm swamped. I do take time off. I'm coming home for Christmas. Yes, I have a life outside of work, mom. I actually went on a date this weekend. Nobody special, I haven't found my Sleepless in Seattle yet but I'm still looking. Yes, when I'm ready to introduce someone you will know, OK? I'm at work, mom. I gotta go. I gotta go. Bye. OK. Not so fast. You didn't call me yesterday. It is way too early to be interrogated. No it's not. If I tell you will you let me go to work? Dish. It wasn't exactly a love connection. So? I don't like boats and we went sailing. OK, I didn't know that you don't like boats. I didn't know that I don't like boats but it was a lot of boats. Like sailing and stories and pictures and trophies. OK, that is too bad. I just don't think I could ever compete with his boat. OK, alright, look. Forget Boat Guy, we just gotta get you back in the saddle pronto. Get you a few more swings at bat before the clock runs out. Take it easy on the metaphors. It's a bit of a problem, I'll work on it. Addison, it's OK. Really. Is it? Have you been conspiring with my mother? Not saying anything. Holly, can I have a word? You know, once a year I get a report on employee's unused vacation time. Did you know that you have 41 days of unused vacation time? I must really love working here. Holly, if you don't use your vacation time you'll lose it. Look, I get it. You wanna be the best. You are the best. I got you. But you don't need another bonus, you need a vacation. So take one. Starting tomorrow. Wait, what? Hand things off to Addison and your team, come back in January refreshed. And Holly, say "thank you". Thank you? Welcome to Montell's. It's Holly Montell. Welcome home! Hi honey! Hi dad! Excuse me, I have a complaint. It is way too early for Christmas carols. It isn't even Thanksgiving yet. Come here, girl! Are you here to spell me? Because I have a plane to catch to the Bahamas. You wish. Did you seriously just fly here? You look amazing. You are too kind. My mom doesn't even know that I'm here yet, but I had to come by and say hi to my bestie. So how was your boat date? I can't talk about it. But how about you? How's Jay? How's the kiddo? The kiddo is this big. No. My dear daughter! Well, she's been here three and a half minutes and she's already running the store. Nope, she's here on personal business. Exactly. Just don't stay too long. We'll never hear the end of it from your mother. I promise, dad. So? Looks good out there, right? It does. Why are you hanging them out here? They'll get all beat up by the weather. Because I like 'em, Uncle Ralph. Plus it's Christmas time. Nick, shouldn't those be at the counter so we can sell them? When you're finished that come and help me in the field. OK. So Jenny was thinking about putting the Doug firs up front. Yeah? Well, maybe she's right, Nick. Really? Whatever happened to "if it ain't broke don't fix it"? Well, you know, this is my last year. Are you gonna threaten me on the day before Thanksgiving, Uncle Ralph? What, you thought I was joking when I said I'd turn the business over to you when you turned 35? I wasn't joking. I know. Do we have to talk about that now? Why not now? You know, your father and I started this business 42 years ago when I was 26. I know. So when are you gonna be ready? You should take the rest of the afternoon off. Come on, Uncle Ralph... In fact, take all the time you need, and don't come back until you're really ready. There's a lot to do. We gotta hang the lights and... Look. Just go home, Nick. I ran this business for 36 years without you, I think I can manage a few lights. Nick, where are you going? Home. Why? Babe, what's going on? Ask Uncle Ralph. Holly, I'm glad you made it home. Me too, Grammy. OK, that needs to be turned. Ivy, darling, can you ask Kyle to come to the kitchen? I do need a man to do that job. Yes. Sure thing. And perhaps next year it'll be your young man that I summon to turkey duty. Really, mom? I just got here. Elaine, she didn't go to Wharton so she could chase a bunch of kids around the house. She could have done that without spending two hundred grand. You always take her side. I always take the right side. Chef Rob has arrived. You scared me but you're a lifesaver. Yeah, you're welcome. For both. Day? Don't ask. Too much trees, not enough dirt? Ha ha. Couldn't have been worse than my day. Yeah? Spill it. Four. Count 'em, four Santas quit. What? Yeah. And two elves. How does that happen? Let me tell you. Hip replacement, lower back pain, the flu... that's actually good that he quit, that would have been bad... and get this. Hearing aid not working properly. He didn't think he was gonna be able to hear the kids. That would be a problem. That is a problem. Maybe that's what I get for only hiring old Santas. What about the elves? I couldn't get a hold of one, the other one got in a fight with her boyfriend so she was too upset to work. That's what you get for only hiring young elves. What am I gonna do? I can play Santa for you. Don't you have a ton of trees to sell? Like, literally a ton of trees? No, 'cause Uncle Ralph sent me home today. What do you mean, he sent you home? You're almost 35. Did you get grounded, too? What're you talking about? Can we watch TV later, or is that off the table? He wants me to take over the business and insisted that I make a decision on it today. OK. Isn't that your plan? It is. It was. I... So... I'm sorry, what's the problem? I'm confused here. Do I have to, you know, decide the day before Thanksgiving what I'm gonna do with the next 30 years of my life? I mean, well I've committed to staffing Santas for the foreseeable future. Hey, if I can do Santas you can do trees. Well, I'm not doing trees right now, which is why I'm gonna do Santa for you. No can do. They send the young Santas home. Not if they're good with kids. Do you even know any kids? I mean, I was great with the 4H volunteers in the lot. You remember? Right. Wait, Rob, you don't think I can do this? Well, I didn't say that, per Se. It was more implied than said but it's just... where are you going, man? Pizza's getting cold. What, you don't think I can be jolly for a couple hours with 20 kids? Yeah, try 50 kids. Eight hours a day on the busiest shopping day of the year. So yeah. I definitely don't think you can. Well, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Robbie! Merry Christmas for who? Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Where are you gonna find Santas this committed? Ho, ho, ho! Don't make me beg, Rob. OK, OK, I give in. Yes! Just take that off. You're my newest Santa. Just burn this outfit, I never wanna see it again, and keep the boots 'cause you can use those. I'll do the rest. Alright. Cheers. I can't look at you. Dad, I can't believe you were at the store until 2:00 am last night. Well, the important thing is that we are ready for Black Friday. Totally ready? No missing shipments, no backorder dramas? No, not this year, it's smooth like butter. I gotta see this. You're supposed to be on vacation, not working at the store. Who said anything about working? Speaking of being ready, will you be attending your birthday ball with anyone we know? Mom, it's hardly my birthday ball. It is the Christmas Eve ball and it's your birthday so... No pressure. It is your 35th. OK, dad. Make her stop. Well, I wanna know, too. Who are you bringing? You see? First of all, we are not celebrating my birthday with the entire population of Noblesville. And second, I've been home for, like, two seconds. When I know who I'm bringing, if I'm bringing anyone, I'll tell you. It's hardly the entire population of Noblesville. OK, who wants pie? I do. Yes. Great. But that... I'll take that, Grammy. Anything I can do? Just don't bother. Honey, she's just being your mother. I know. Listen, I really don't want you working at the store this season. Take some well-deserved time off. Do something you love. I love the store. I'm just gonna swing by and say hi to some folks. It'll only be an hour. One hour. Please tell mom to knock it off. Otherwise I won't be her kitchen slave on Christmas. I mean it. Da-da-da! Grammy, you outdid yourself this year. Arturo! I've missed you. Holly, hey! What're you doing here? It looks like you've got things under control here. Yeah. So give me the dirt. How's business? Alive, kicking. Alright, well how about a bike ride while I'm home? In this cold? I don't think so, Seattle girl. Alright, softie. Bye, hipster. Hey. Hi! You're back so soon. Lucky me. Shh. It's only for one hour because I'm on vacation. Elle. Your Santa's here. Hi. Hi. What happened to Larry? Larry retired last year. This Santa's kinda young. He is young. Excuse me. Hi. I know I'm young for Santa but I'm good with kids. It doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to call a staffing company. I'm so sorry, there's just... there are so many kids out there. It's a lot. That's great. And the staffing company is just running really short on old Santas. They know you wanted one but they sent me because they knew I'd do a good job. Come on, give me a shot. If you really think I suck I'll help you find an older Santa. We got a lot of kids waiting, just wanna know if we should tell them Santa's sick or... Nope. He's coming. Let's get that beard on. OK. Let's hope this works. Yeah. Sorry. OK, here goes nothing. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, kids! Merry Christmas! Come. Come sit next to Santa. Hi. Do you have something important to tell me? Crisis averted. That's an awesome gift. We'll definitely get that for ya. High five. Merry Christmas. Bye, Emily. OK, Merry Christmas. Come sit next to Santa. Come on! Come all ye faithful No. Joyful and triumphant. Nice try but it's not gonna happen. Fine. Cara, are you ill? Yeah. Come, sit. I thought you looked pale. OK, you know what's not good for business on Black Friday? A sick elf and a bunch of kids. Why don't you send her home and get someone else? Not possible. The staffing company is already down two elves, that's why Cara's an elf. I'm sure it's just a 24-hour thing. Well, who else can do it? I mean, I'm sure you have tons of temp help today. I looked all over the store but I... Yeah, we're short staffed and this costume is really small. What? No. No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't even be suggesting it if there was anyone else who could do it. I will help Santa but in my own clothes, OK? Holls, I hate to break it to you but that three-year-old who's been waiting 30 minutes to see Santa does not want to see you as Santa's helper. She wants to believe. Are you seriously saying if I don't dress like an elf I'm going to ruin Christmas for a three-year-old? Remind me to have you fired after Christmas. This is great. A baby-faced Santa and an elf with an MBA. Elle, I need... Don't say a word. Can we get this over with? I'm sure I don't need to say anything about your elf attitude. Shut it. OK. I'll be an elf. I'll even have a great elf attitude, I will. But please don't make me wear these shoes. They are killing me. And then you're gonna have to amputate my feet which defeats the whole purpose of this elf-speriment. I have an idea. Like another person wearing this suit? Nope. See? Look, he's doing great. Here's a chair just for you. OK, so what're you thinking you want this year? He's doing better than great. He doesn't even need me. All he needs is a Montell to show him the ropes. No. Please don't tell him that my dad owns the store. Why not? Because nobody likes working with the boss's daughter. Just let him be Santa and please let me keep a shred of dignity. I mean, look at me. I just wanna be an anonymous elf. OK, OK. Those are great. You better get out there. Santa needs you. Go home, Cara. It's an elf! It's Santa's elf! OK, who's next to see Santa? What's your name? Holly. It's Holly the elf. That's so funny. Her name's Holly the elf. OK. Come on. Go sit in that little chair over there. Hi, do you have your Christmas list. You sure you're gonna be OK? Dad. You're gonna ruin the illusion. A computer. Good choice. Come on, sweetie. Mommy wants a picture. Merry Christmas, Todd. Do you mind? No, not at all. Thank you. Come on, go up there. Merry Christmas, young lady. Have you been a good girl? I thought so. And is there maybe something that you want from Santa? That's an amazing gift. Picture? Yes. Perfect. OK, Merry Christmas. Say "Merry Christmas". Merry Christmas. Aw, thank you. Great, Merry Christmas. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas. So, Holly the elf. I'm afraid so, yep. And your name is...? St. Nick. Funny Santa. I don't wanna tell you how to do your job but I had an idea. Maybe if you usher the kids up and you take the picture for the parents and then we hustle them off we can keep the line moving. Sure, great. Great idea. Alright everybody. Sorry for the wait. Get your cameras and your phones ready and I'll take the pictures and we'll get some great shots of you and Santa. Come on, it's your turn. Hi. Sweetie, let me take your jacket. Alright, say "cookies". Cookies. Thanks for your help. I'm gonna post this on social media. Great. He'll be here until six tonight. Hashtag "Santa at Montell's". Perfect. Where do you keep the princess dresses? Floor 3, next to kid's shoes. Thank you. You good, sweetie? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hey. Santa, you need some cookies? No. Santa has other needs. Got it. You are killing it out there. You're not so bad yourself, you're a natural. Careful. What, being an elf isn't a life's dream? Not exactly. But I'll do just about anything for my friend Elle. Those are some serious boots. Thanks. We've been through a lot together. Holly, there you are. Hey. Elle asked me to see if you guys could head back out. We just sat down. Just the messenger. Nice boots. Gibney's? Yeah. Your eye-stay piece is loose. Why don't you bring them by the shoe department, I'll fix it for you. Great, thanks so much. That's awesome. OK, I'll see you guys out there? Alright. Alright. Great. Alright. Back at it. Do I look OK? I... so many things could go wrong. Actually your bell is crooked. Thanks. OK sweetie, it's your turn. I like your antlers. Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, what's your name? Would you like to tell Santa what you want for Christmas? You wanna bet this next guy's a slugger? A slugger? Hi. What do you want for Christmas? Easy. Boxing gloves? OK, cool. High five. Open fist. There you go. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. How did you know? Santa's intuition? I didn't think you meant literally. Yeah. OK, so I have to look out for sluggers and what else is there? I don't know, let's see. Hi. You want to sit next to Santa? Nope. OK. Snubber. Couldn't care less. I feel for you. Those are the ones that hurt. How's it going? Great, but I think Santa needs his halftime break. I know a place where you can get lunch without any snubbers. Down the hall. Santa needs to have his milk and cookies but he'll be back in 30 minutes. I've been catching the parents in line and asking them what they need to get their kids for Christmas and then telling them where to get it in the store. I love it. Even better, let's do it for them. Perfect. Yeah. OK, it looks like we have turkey and ham. Ham please. Okay. What is it that you do when you're not being Santa? Lumberjack? Kind of, yeah. How'd you know? Seriously? Yeah. I... it's just that you look more like Paul Bunyan than Santa. Don't tell the bosses that. Your secret's safe with me. OK. OK, you're next. Hope on up there. Hi. Two of you. Nice. Picture? Mom! Holly. Mom? Check you out. What are you doing here? Well, when your father told us why you didn't come home we thought we better come and see for ourselves. Do you need more help dear? I swear I've got an elf suit packed away somewhere. Only if mom wears one, too. We could start a trend. Multi-generational elves. Elaine, Ivy, what about it? I always knew that suit would come in handy. But mom, seriously. You gotta go. Why? Well, elves don't have moms checking up on them. Yes, quite right, the children. Alright. OK, bye. Bye. Bye. Is that your mom? And my grandma and my sister. That's awesome. It's so nice to be with family this time of year. Is it? I'm joking. Where are all the kids? It's Black Friday. I guess people are shopping online nowadays. There's gotta be some way we can get more kids over here. I have an idea but I'll need some things from my truck and we'll need a table. Can we do that? Sure. OK. Alright. This is such a great idea. How much should we charge? Charge? I don't know. I never thought about it. I just make them. What, you made these? Yeah. Hey, guys. Fun ornaments. Hey. Is this Santa's workshop? It is. I love it! I'm gonna make an announcement on the PA. Let's draw some business over here. Great. He's adorable. Someone's here to see Santa again. OK, kids. I hate to ruin the fun but Santa has some business up at the North Pole. He has a long list of gifts that he has to make for you. Are you gonna have this decorating workshop tomorrow? Hey, Santa! We doing this tomorrow? Great. OK, we'll be here at 10:00 am. Tell all your friends. Hashtag "Santa's workshop at Montell's". I did. I will. Great. Merry Christmas. Mommy, can we make an ornament? Yes, we can come back tomorrow. Hey there. Hey. Thanks. How's everything going on the lot? We've only sold 30 trees an hour throughout the entire day. How'd you pull that off? Ralph let me print out flyers and I had the 4H kids pass them out. Really? I thought he was against flyers. He was. Until he saw the flyer. That's great. I'm impressed. So I thought I would stop by to see what was going on between you and Ralph. It seems kind of weird. You two are always conspiring like two thieves about to break out of jail, so what's going on? He wants to retire after this season. OK. Yeah, I don't blame him. 42 Christmas seasons on some cold dirt, I'd probably want my spot on the sand in Aruba, too. And? He decided that I had to make a decision on whether I was taking over the business that day. But I thought that was your plan, to take over the business. Yeah, it is. But I just need some time. To do what? Make ornaments? OK, Nick. OK. You know where to find me, if you need me. So much for only an hour? I am gonna hear about this when I get home. Suddenly it's everyone's business how I choose to spend my vacation. Well, tell them sales went up five percent in the first hour you were on the floor as an elf, and they held steady 'til 5:30. Normally it drops off around 3:30 on a Black Friday. I told some parents that we'll be decorating ornaments in the morning so I guess that means... You have a hot date with a certain Santa at 10:00 am? What? Come on. You can't fool me. I got eyes to see. What are you talking about? You look at that Santa the way you looked at Roland Pierce in the fifth grade. You remember him? Yes, I remember him. He was my boyfriend from early morning math class until recess when he moved on to greener pastures. He was a player. He was. OK, back to Nick. You are completely delusional. There is nothing going on between me and Nick. Plus, I live like 2,000 miles away. I am not interested in a long-distance relationship. Plus, he's probably married. Like you didn't notice he wasn't wearing a wedding ring. Or he has a girlfriend, or a significant other. Whatever. A guy like that is too... Gorgeous. Good with kids. To be alone. Well, I could find out. No. No, no, no, no, no. We're not in high school. I do not need my BFF going to check and see if some guy is available. Elle. I mean, I'll be cool about it. No. I got... I gotta go. Promise me. Fine. I gotta go pick up the little guy. You coming? Sorry. My real work needs me. Alright. You know, I don't know how we're gonna keep up. We went through two boxes of ornaments today. I can't believe people are actually buying them. Of course they're buying them. They're amazing. You know, we could open this whole area up and make like a real Santa's Workshop. You know, I was just thinking the same thing. It feels like it wants to be something more. Yeah. I could bring my work bench, my tools... Yeah? Yeah. Well, when do you want to do that? I don't know, I mean, I could do it tonight. Tonight? Yeah. That would be great. Great. Hey. Hey. How're you doing? You know, I've been thinking all day about what I wanted to say to you and I came up with all of these great things but come back, Nick. We need you. Ralph needs you even if he's too stubborn to say it. What is going on with you? Look, he told me to go away and think about it until I was ready. I've been thinking about it and I'm still not ready. I thought that this has been your plan since... It was. Are you having second thoughts about us? Are you? I am. We've been drifting apart for a long time now. We don't talk anymore. I think we should break up. Yeah, I think you're right. I think we just want different things. So don't tell your mother but I made some of my special hot cocoa. You want some? Alright. I'm on vacation. Coulda fooled me. Hey, can I ask you a question? Yeah, shoot. Why didn't you tell me that the store was in trouble? Honey, I just didn't want you to worry. Well, I am worried. Well, don't. We've got miles to go before then. Marshmallows? You're the worst. I thought you were on vacation. Alright, I'll take a few. You looked great out there today. Yeah, it was fun. Go ahead. What? I know there's something you wanna ask me. No, no. Nah, I just... I'm just enjoying our special tradition. Well, I gotta head off. At this hour? Where? I gotta make some Christmas magic. Hey. Hey. Out of the Santa suit. Nice. You too. You OK? You're not your usual jolly self. The life of a Montell Santa isn't always so jolly, I guess. You wanna get started? Yeah. That looks better. You really love Christmas, don't you? I do. I really do. Christmas is a big deal with my family. Yeah? Yeah, Santa and cookies and decorations and... and of course there's the Christmas Eve ball. I'm told I attended my first one in diapers. I've never been. Are you serious? Yeah. How is that possible? I thought everyone in Noblesville has been at least once. Everyone except me and maybe my Uncle Ralph. How's the sign coming? It's coming. It looks really good. I'm impressed. It looks pretty good. Are you kidding? It looks amazing. You got mad skills, Santa. I bet by Christmas it'll be perfect. So, you never told me what it is you do when you're not Santa-ing. I'm a tree farmer. A tree farmer. Yeah. I should have guessed by the flannel. Are you dissing my flannel? No, no. I live in Seattle where flannel is practically a religion. Seattle? So are you a sailor or a computer coder? No, not quite. I I'm an executive at an active wear company. But I'm also a cyclist so I fit in. A cyclist. Is that a more serious bicyclist? I guess. I mean, I did bike over 1,500 miles last year. That's impressive. So I thought you were a carpenter or like an artist. I am. I wanna be. I make custom furniture. That's cool. So you do that and you run a tree farm? Well, the farm was owned by my father and uncle. Was owned? Yeah, my dad passed when I was 14, so I sorta took over and run it with my uncle now. I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. Thanks. What about your mom? She died two years ago. I'm officially going to stop complaining about my mother. So I mean it's it's there for me to take over if I want it to be. Do you want it? That's the question everyone keeps asking me. Only they don't ask "if", they ask "when". I totally get it. My dad owns a company, too, and he hasn't asked me in a while if I'm gonna take over but I know that he wants me to. What do you want? It's hard, isn't it? It is. It's so hard. 'Cause I do, but I don't, you know? I love my job in Seattle. I just got a promotion, I love the pacific northwest, but my family's here. My best friend's here, and I grew up in my dad's business, if you know what I mean. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Let me know when you figure it out. I will. So did you move to Seattle for someone? Yes and no. I moved there after grad school with my boyfriend but when we split up I stayed. What about you? Did you stay for someone? I think I did for a while. Then I realized I really stayed for the place itself. It's funny how it knows you. It does, doesn't it? Yeah. I feel like I can talk to you about anything. So do I. Merry Christmas. Bye, Merry Christmas. You were so right. That area needed trees. How did you know what it needed? Santa's intuition? You know what we should do? We should have an ornament decorating contest. We can announce the winner with the holiday bake-off winner at the Christmas Eve ball. I love it. Hi. Hi. Merry Christmas, man. Mom, Grammy, Ivy. Let me guess. You got the elf costumes. Where do I change? I do wish you would stop bringing that up as if it actually might happen. I've always wanted to do that. Like LeBrain Jones. LeBron James, Grammy. But A for effort. The reason why we're all here is because we wanted to bring you this. It's perfect. Thanks, Ive, can you put it over there? Sure. I do wish I had a grandchild to bring to Santa. And on that note I'm gonna go look for a gift for Kyle. Mom, don't you have somewhere you need to be? Holly, I have barely seen you all week, and did you know that my daughter is turning 35 on Christmas Eve and she has yet to tell us who she's bringing to the Christmas Eve ball? OK, mom. Santa does not care about my love life. He has Mrs. Claus. Look who it is again. Santa, are you flying your plane to the North Pole? I am gonna take my plane. How did you know my sleigh was out for repairs? I was thinking very hard with my brain and I figured it out. You're very smart. Put it here. OK, Merry Christmas. Bye. Bye. Bye. Ho, ho, ho. Santa needs to go feed the reindeers for a little bit. So I'm gonna take a little break. So you must be Holly's grandmother. You can call me Grammy. OK Grammy, I will do that. Thanks. You know, I can always use a good elf around here. Don't keep a promise you can't make. That's... that's so funny, my mom used to switch up little sayings like that. Really? I only know one person that did that. Is your mother Rachael Porter by any chance? Yeah. Well, that's who I got it from. Well, she could make me laugh out loud. How is she? She passed away a couple years ago. I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you. She was such a light in my life. How did you know her? I volunteer at the hospital. You know, I remember she used to bring you up there on snow days when she couldn't cover her shift. Yeah. You have an amazing memory. Well, I'm not one of those old ladies who can't remember things. You're definitely not. Well Grammy, it looks like Holly cannot join us for lunch today. Quite right. She has big elf responsibilities. Yes, she does. It's so nice to see you again, but you know, I didn't get your name. It's Nick. Nick. Yeah. OK, Grammy, I'll see you soon. Good. Bye-bye. Bye. Lovely to meet you. Nice to meet you. Bye. Hey. Let's go. Thank you. I think mothers were put on this earth to torture their children. I'm so sorry. I said I was going to stop complaining about her. It's OK. All elves make mistakes. I think you're gonna want these on a day like today. Thank you. It's you! It's me. Well, between the boots and the eyes I recognize you. You're actually handsome without that get-up. Thank you. Almost as handsome as JD. Who's JD? My husband of 62 years. You guys had quite the run, didn't you? Yes. JD would have loved to have seen Holly in there. She's so like him, vibrant and kind and so smart. You must really miss him. Every day. We did have something special. Kind of like what I see between the two of you. Holly? We're not... I mean, we're friends. JD and I were friends once, too. Time will tell. Alright, I gotta get going. Stay warm. You too. Bye. Dinner's almost ready. Remember that trip we took to California? I do. We were visiting your cousins. You two were so young I can't believe you actually remember that trip. Uncle Jimmy's beach, that's what I remember. Visiting Uncle Jimmy's beach. I think I thought all of Santa Monica bay was Uncle Jimmy's beach. Awe. Those dresses you and Grammy made for us with the fairy tale theme. Yeah. I remember it was a really big deal that you let me wear that dress. I had to promise like ten times not to spill anything. Well, you didn't disappoint me. Like I am now? Disappointing you? You don't disappoint me. Is that what you think? Yeah. If I don't bring the right guy to the ball or if I don't... Honey. I am so sorry. You don't disappoint me. You, married or unmarried, you are enough. Thanks, mom. Holly. I love you, sweetheart. Dinner? Yeah. Yeah. Not funny. You never don't have a joke, Rob. Well, always come prepared. That's the first thing they tell you in boy scouts. So I talked to Jenny. Yeah. I'm sorry, man. It's OK. She was right. We haven't been connecting for a while now. Women. How do they know so much about us? That sigh doesn't sound like it was about a woman, though. What a day. I'm all ears. Well, one, I think it's weird you know so much about my sighs, but two, I forgot how hard it was to Santa. You put the suit on? I put the suit on. I swore I'd never do it again and here I am cursing my own self, Rob you idiot. I would say I know what you mean but I don't know. What? I love it! Really? Yeah, really. Don't tell me you found your calling. I don't know about my calling but, you know, the kids are great and I have this awesome elf who's helping me out. Elf? I didn't send you an elf. Yeah, I think she's just giving her friend a hand from the store. Now I have more questions. What's her name? Her name's Holly, and she's really funny and she gets the crowd going and the kids love her, so... I don't know. You like her. I barely know her. Sounds like you like her. Yeah, because you know, she's... she's really great. And she's making my job easier. OK. What's her story? What do you mean, what's her story? What's her last name? Where'd she go to school? Where does she live? These are questions humans ask other humans when they like them. Yeah, OK, well I don't know her last name, actually. And I don't know where she went to school but none of it really matters 'cause she lives in Seattle. So? Seattle Schmeattle. Who cares? Like she's gonna move back home because a complete stranger likes her. Well, they say every important person in your life starts out a stranger. Who's they? I don't know. I just like the way it sounded. I'll bring in the team. Holly, let me introduce Mallory Tuckman from Wincoff Retail. Holly Montell. You're John's daughter. I am. And Elle Simmons, our head of marketing and special events. Charmed. Ladies, please join us. Well, John just took me on the complete tour. I have to say you run a tight ship. They run the tight ship. I'm... I'm just a passenger. Well, I'm gonna cut to the chase. You have a thriving business serving a loyal customer base and Wincoff Retail has aggressive growth goals and to meet them we need to acquire. That's where Montell's comes in. We've actually had our eye on your store for a few years now. We're flattered. Well, why don't we talk after you've had a chance to fully review our offer. Let's do that. I'll show you out. Well, I don't have a Christmas tune for this one. Hey, hon. Still working I see. These gifts aren't gonna wrap themselves. You deserve a break. I love wrapping gifts. It's therapeutic. I can't argue with that. So, see our latest numbers? I may have taken a look. So you know how good they are. And I don't know what's going on with you and that Santa but if you figure it out tell me because I wanna bottle it and sell it. I also looked at the offer. Good. What do you think? It's solid. It is, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're thinking. Yeah, I am. I mean, look at what you did out there. Santa's corner is the reason we're 40 percent up over last year. You're driving business throughout the entire store. So yeah, I wish you could stay. Hey, I know. You love Seattle. You just made VP and I'm very proud of you. I was just... I was just dreaming out loud. I knew that one day you were gonna have to sell. It's just kind of a shock that that day is already here. So hey, if after this little chat you feel like you need more therapy I got some presents you can wrap. Bring 'em on. I love you, dad. OK. Hey. Good morning, Holly. You're here early today. An elf's work is never done. Are these new? No. They've been here a while, you've just been too busy to notice them. You know, they say boots are coming back. They're sturdy, comfortable, and unexpectedly stylish. Believe me. I know all about boots. You know, if you find a pair that fits you can wear them forever. No, I'm telling you. Emma wanted a basketball, Abby wanted a doctor's kit, Connor wanted a dump truck... You are making all of this up. I'm not. Sarah wanted an art kit and she was very specific about the colours. There is no way you remember what all these kids want. It's a steel trap. I'm not convinced. I'm Santa, I know what the kids want. You, on the other hand, though, I'm not so sure about. Me? Well, I want what every elf wants. What does every elf want? A toy for every child. Of course. I don't know, I'm new to this elf thing. Apparently, it goes with the job. I can get behind a toy for every kid. I'm Santa. But what else? I want to find my true North. And I really, really want a new hat. Sorry kids, Santa will be back tomorrow at 10:00 am. He's gotta go get some milk and cookies. Awe. It's OK, we'll come back. Let's go. I'm thinking no milk and cookies for me tonight. I've actually got a beer waiting for me at the Santa convention. The Santa convention? Yeah. Supposedly all the local Santas, meet up at Malone's Bar on the 20th every year to celebrate, commiserate, you name it. I gotta see this. You should come. Wait, are you inviting me, an elf, to the Santa convention? Maybe I am. Maybe you'll see me there. Great. Maybe you should come at 8:00. Maybe. No. We can't do that. Because it's against our policy. With you in just one second, ma'am. I know. My hands are tied. OK. Do your best. How can I help you? Hi, I'm Holly Montell. I called earlier from Montell's department store in Noblesville. I don't know if you've heard of it. I've heard of it. My mom used to work there. Really? Yeah, in cosmetics. Jan Darling. Mrs. Darling. How is she? She's good. Retired, lots of gardening, watching grand-babies. Please tell her I said hello. I'm... I'm sorry, what was your name? Jordie. Jordie. Nice to meet you. I... I just had a question. How long have you worked here? Seven years. OK, so you were here before new management. Yep. How are things different? We're more efficient, but if you ask me the heart's gone out of this place. Why do you ask? Wincoff Retail offered to buy Montell's. You stand to make a lot from that. Probably. Well, what's your heart worth? Santa. Yeah. Hey, I thought I would take you up on your offer to fix my boots. Yes. 'Cause I love it when people repair their shoes instead of just tossing them out. I would never toss them out. I love 'em. I even have a nickname for them. Really? Yeah, I'm not gonna tell you. OK. Well put your name there. Alright. And I will fill out the rest. Here you go. Thank you. Your name is seriously Nick? It is, I swear. Well, I will have these for you, Nick, before your next shift. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Hi. Excuse me, I'm sorry. There you are. You made it. I can't believe I found you in a room of a zillion Santas. It's crazy. This is, I know. What do you want to drink? White wine please. You look amazing. Thank you. You look... Yeah. The same. Well, you can't come to the Santa convention in your street clothes. Excuse me, since when does Santa wear sneakers? These? Well, my Gibney's took the night off. They've been working hard, they deserve it. I noticed there are no elves at this convention. Yeah, no elves. They gotta get themselves organized. We're the unsung heroes of Christmas, we elves. Absolutely. Thank you. To elves. To elves. So tell me the truth. Is your last name Claus? You ask tough questions. A man of mystery. I guess it's a little unfair, though. I do know a bit more about you than you know about me. How's that? I mean, I know your birthday. Right. My mom. Thanks mom. I know what it's like to have a birthday on a big day, even better a big birthday on a big day. Really? Try and top having your birthday on Christmas Eve. Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day? No. Yes. No. That is so much worse. Yeah, it's pretty bad. That is so much worse, especially for a guy. I'll drink to that. It's bad enough having your birthday being made a big deal of but to have your birthday and your love life being made a big deal of every year? Sorry. And plus, I mean, this year is the big 35. Brace yourself now. Trying to brace myself. I'm sorry. Sorry. No. Is everything OK. I'm so sorry, I have to go. OK. I'm sorry. It's an emergency. I totally understand. I'm so sorry. What happened? He was complaining about being cold, he wouldn't go to the hut to warm up. I forgot about it and then he just fell over. I'll give you two a minute. Hey. You know if you wanted to see me all you had to do was call. I'm sorry I wasn't there. I'm fine, I told you I don't need to be here. I always say when I see a farmer I know it's serious. Farmers never go to the hospital. What does that mean? It's just an observation. Well, you have hypothermia, sir. And a heart palpitation that needs monitoring. But with proper care he can be home in a few days. However, no more working outdoors in the cold. You need to rest and recuperate. Thank you. I'll be back to check on you later. Is this why you insisted that I take over the day before Thanksgiving? I want you to take over because... the farm is yours. It's your inheritance. And it's what your father wanted for you. It's time. What's going on? What do you mean? You never sing with me. You're in love. What? With that Santa. Stop, I'm not in love. Yet. Holly, you better snatch him up while there's still time. Speaking of time, this elf has to get to the North Pole. Holly! Take these to Nick? Of course. That's, like, 13 gifts. You know what? Sure. I see a lot of sluggers in this line. Where's Nick? It's St. Nick to you, my dear. Look, it's one of my elves. Ho, ho, ho. You're next. Hop on up there. There you go. I'll be right back. OK, one gift. What do you want? Hey, where do we get our Santa's? Rob's Holiday Staffing, why? I need to find out what happened to our Santa. He's not out there? No, it's just some old guy. He left his boots with Arturo last night and he put his name on this work order form but I can't read it. Could be Parker? Let's call the staffing company. You OK? Yeah, go ahead. Rob's Holiday Staffing, Rob speaking. Hi. I'm calling from Montell's department store regarding our Santa. Hi. Did he show up? Yes. It's just that we're a little concerned. We were really happy with the Santa you sent before. Nick? Nick had a family emergency. Right. I'm so sorry. I hope everything's OK. I think so. Well, please tell him that we hope everything improves and we'd like to send him a card. Is it alright if we send it to Nick Parker, care of Rob's Holiday Staffing? Yeah, that's fine. I'm... I'm sorry, are you still there? Hello? Hello? She's gone. OK. Hello? I hate tapioca. Nobody hates tapioca. I do. What? I do. See? What'd I tell you? It tastes awful. Well, let's get this exam over so I can get you some jello. OK, now you're talking. Alright, time to get my own tapioca. Take mine. Please. Hey, bro. Hey. Hey man. Thanks for coming, guys. Yeah. How is he? Stubborn. What else is new? It never ends. That's fine, take it, Rob. Yeah? Yeah. OK, two minutes. Hello? Hey. Hey. You wanna talk? Sure. OK, let's go. Thanks again for bringing him in, for being there. I'm glad I was. How's everything over at the lot? Do I need to go over there? Nah. Things have slowed down now that we're so close to Christmas. My brother's got it covered. OK, good. I don't know if Ralph told you but this season has been our best in over ten years. Really? Yeah. I've been able to do all of these things that I wanted to do. At first I was upset with you for leaving us with so much to do but then I realized I can do this myself. Jenny, that's really amazing. And I've had so many ideas and... not arguing with you about them has just been easier. I get it. And I'm glad. Friends? Of course, friends. Anything? Who knew there were so many Nick Parkers? But no Santa Nick. I know. This is impossible. We're never gonna find him. Holls? Maybe we're going about this the wrong way. Yeah? I have an idea. Really? It's pretty perfect? I don't know. What do you mean? It's brilliant. We're already getting buzz on social media. We're driving business to the store and finding your Santa. Not so far. We will. I know it. OK. You're out of the elf outfit already? So? Listen, I wanted to tell you, I went to Broman's in Carmel. You did? When did you find time for that? Well, after my elf duties I squeezed in a scout the offer trip. OK. And I ran into Jan Darling's daughter. She's worked there for seven years. Jan, she was a great employee. Yeah. And? She said the heart's gone from the place, dad. So the offer's good for us. Us? You. You're the reason Christmas was such a success. You cracked the code. Well, who knew the code was an elf suit and a young Santa? It surprised me. I thought you were gonna kill Elle when she made you put that outfit on. Yeah. I couldn't have done it. I really enjoyed being there with the kids and the parents and all the customers who have been coming to the store for as long as I can remember, and they're bringing their kids. Those kids are our future. It was rewarding and fun and the numbers went up. But? But it's all making it so much harder. So. That's that. Accept the offer. Yeah. Hey. My little elf. You put a lot of heart into your work, and that's good. Save some heart for the other parts of your life. Promise me. OK. That's done. This is a great idea, Holly. It was all Elle. Gotta go, it's crazy in here. This is so fun, right? Right? Why am I doing this? What do you mean? Why am I trying to find him? I'm sorry, is this a trick question? No, seriously. I leave in two weeks, I love my job in Seattle, I live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Close your eyes. What? Just do it. Tell me, what's your favourite colour. You know it's blue. Favourite Christmas song? "The Christmas Song". - Beach or mountains? - Mountains. - Favourite name? - Nick. Ha. And that's why you're doing it. Holly, I have never seen you happier than when you're with him. Yeah? Yeah. And if you don't at least try to find him you'll always wonder what might have been. OK. You know you're kind of brilliant, right? Well, I mean, I wouldn't say it but if you wanna say it. I love you. I love you. OK, I gotta go find out why the sale signs aren't up. He'll be back. Why is everyone so sure? I'm sure he already misses... his boots. You're starting to look like your old self, Uncle Ralph. See? I told you I was fine. Hey, I didn't say anything. It was that lady in the white coat that was making all the fuss. Yeah, maybe she's right. Maybe I did need to take it a little easy. I mean, she may know a thing or two, she's a doctor after all. So what's the word? I can't work the lot anymore, so you gotta take over. Uncle Ralph, I love working with you and I'm so grateful for everything you've done for me. You know, you taught me to be responsible and honest, but the farm and the business, it just isn't for me, and this is probably the hardest thing I'll ever do. But I love making furniture, and I'm good at it, and I wanna follow that. I figured you'd say something like that. But you do make good furniture, though. You think so? Yeah. I also may have a solution that would let you retire and me do what I love. Yeah. What's that? Hand the farm over to Jenny. Jenny? Yeah. I mean, she loves it, she's great at it. She said you guys had the best season in 10 years. What do you think? Well, she's a hard worker. Works harder than anyone. Yeah. Jenny. Well, I think you may be right. - Hey. - Hey. You did this. All this. It happened because of you. Thanks, dad. You know what I'm thinking? Some special hot cocoa when we get home? Thank you. Hi. Grammy, what're you doing here? I'll ask you the same question, Saint Nick. Just visiting my uncle, but as me. Well, I hope everything's OK. Thanks. Yeah, we're getting there. You know, you never got to put your elf suit on. Sadly, not my only regret in life. You know, I'm so glad I bumped into you. Do you have plans on Christmas Eve? You sure know how to put a guy on the spot. Well, at my age I don't want to waste time, you know, dancing around the subject. No, ma'am, I don't have any plans, but don't tell anybody because I don't want them worrying about Santa. How would you like to be my guest at the Christmas Eve ball? You could be my one plus. You know, I'm just really not in the party mood. You have a girlfriend. There you go again. No, I don't. Well, then you'll be my guest. I'll leave a ticket at will call under my name. You know, I just don't think I'm gonna be able to make it. It's impossible to say no to me. Is it? Futile is resistance. There you go again, slaying me with those sayings. How about I say I'll think about it? Arrive at 8:00. Put on a nice jacket and a tie. And don't forget your dancing shoes. No Santa suit? Give the old boy a rest. There's my car. Let me give you a hand. Thank you. The ticket will be under my name, Adeline Montell. I know you won't disappoint me. Adeline Montell? I really appreciate all this, Elle, but it's just one Christmas wish that's not gonna come true. Hey, you don't know that yet. It's not Christmas. Hey. I love you, I'm gonna miss you so much. I love you, too. And nothing says you gotta go back. Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to begin by thanking you very much for joining us here this evening. We should head in. Yeah. It's your support year after year that makes the Christmas Eve ball such a success. And now, the winner of the holiday bake-off... Alegra Hunter and her caramel macchiato bundt cake. You came. I did. Merry Christmas, my dear. Merry Christmas, Grammy. Allow me. And of course our newest competition, the ornament decorating competition... Nicola Rose. I need to stop here for a second. I thought you might. How're you doing, old girls? Looking good tonight. Please be careful when trying the boots on. I've got a difficult announcement tonight. It's something I spent a lot of thought on. Wait, you're him. You're Santa... I mean, you're Nick? Yeah. ...but this is something bittersweet that's been in the works for a long time. I am very proud of what we have built here at Montell's over the years and I... excuse me. That's my daughter. What is it Holly? Don't sell, dad. I'm staying. As I was saying, I have a big announcement tonight. This year was a roller-coaster until a magical elf joined our team. My daughter's worked at Montell's on and off since she was very young. She knows the business well, but this year she proved that she is the key to our future. I am excited and very proud to introduce the new CEO of Montell's department store, is Holly Montell. Yes! Holly Montell? She's in there somewhere. Go find her. Thank you dad. Thank you everyone. I can't wait to get started. Come here, girl. Congratulations. I can't believe I get you back. I don't know why it took me so long to figure it out. We're going to make an unbelievable team. Excuse me, Elle, I have to steal her. Yeah. Of course. I have to get home before Santa does, so Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. So, nice surprise to me you did not sing "happy birthday" so thank you. I think this is a much better surprise. A celebratory father-daughter dance? A celebratory dance. So what was it? What do you mean? What was it that made you change your mind? Falling in love. With the store, with Noblesville. It's as if it knows me. What about Wincoff Retail? You said it, I couldn't let them take the heart out of our store. And I may have built a 30-day out clause into the contract. I thought just maybe you might come around. May I have this dance? I'm gonna go find your mom. How...? Am I here? Well, your grandmother can be very persuasive. Yes. You had an emergency. Is everything OK? Yeah. Everything is great. And happy birthday. Thank you. So you are the new CEO of Montell's, congratulations. I decided to come back to the family business. So you figured it out. I did. With a little help from Santa. And I saw that there was a boot contest. Were you really gonna give my boots away? Only to the rightful owner, I promise. So, what do you think? The famous Christmas Eve ball. Admit it, you wish you'd come every year. I wish I had come every year. And I'm glad I dressed up. You do look dashing. I'm glad you're here. I'm really glad I'm here, too. I'm sorry. Santa's boots. Alright, alright. This is really impressive wrapping. Open it and find out. I love it. Love it. That's lovely, Holly. Flannel from Seattle. It's gorgeous. Look at that colour. But the real gift is being here with you, Uncle Ralph and the rest of your family. Maui? Mom! Dad! Maui! What is this? Just something I made. I love it. That's adorable. And he made it, yeah. Look at that. I figured it'll tide you over until it's cycling weather. It'll tide me over, as long as you come with it. Calm down, mom.
