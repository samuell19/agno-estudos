Hey, come and make a wish! - How do you do it? - Does it work? Yes. Just write on the amulet what you want a man to say to you, and your wish will come true! Of course I want him to say "I love you"! Your boyfriend hasn't said that to you? I hope he'll say that he'll take care of me, and ask me to marry him. I'm more practical, I want him promise to give me all his money, and listen to me. "You jump, I jump", that's romantic! Housekeeping is at 10. I'll take care of it for you, bye! BoBo, you look great in this color! Good morning! Wait If you show more boobs, and the slit was higher, - you'll drive men crazy. - You're making me blush! Where was I? Two thousand? No problem! When should we sign it? Tonight? I'll get a room at "Grand Royal". I'll make sure the chicks are ready. You don't have to get mad every time I bring this up. We've been together for 3 years. I'm afraid it'll end if things don't change. - Miss - You think that's how two people maintain a relationship? What matters is whether they have feeling for each other. I do, I love you. Then for once go with my decision. I already stopped talking about marriage. I just want us to live together. I'm sorry miss, this is my room. I need my personal creative space. I need to make money. Don't pick fights with me for these trifles. - What matters is I love you. - What would you like, sir? Coffee, please. Get these thoughts out of your head, okay? They just confuse you. Aren't we doing pretty well? You stay over for a night when you're free. I don't see a problem. Easy for you to say! You have someone to order around with no strings attached. - Who is this? - A passerby. - Who was that? - That was Kinki, she got transferred here today. What "Pinkie"? What are you talking about? I told you not to approve her transfer and you wouldn't listen. When did you say that? See, she's losing it again, God knows what she's up to now. Kinki… Kinki… She locked herself inside. Let her be, no big deal. Something's wrong! It's quiet in there. Will she do something stupid… Kinki, open up! I have to go, a pregnant woman can't hold it too long! - Open up, hurry up! - Open up! She cut herself. Get Serena for the keys! She went out. What's that smell? Smells like antiseptic solution. She's killing herself twice! Let's ram the door! Is that necessary? The restroom's a mess, might as well clean it up. I broke something out there, watch your feet! Cleaning the restroom is at least constructive. I heard she played with the paper shredder last time, and wasted a few boxes of paper. Andy, Ronald says it's urgent, he wants you to take a look. I want the day off! Come again? I want the day off! What is your reason? Are you sick? Then I quit, I want the day off! One month notice. I'll pay for your losses! I want the day off! I want the day off… So leave! What you looking at? Go back to work! She's been waiting for you in the conference room. Long time no see! Yes, it's been a while. Got any kids? I'm divorced. Then your insurance payment can be cheaper. I came here because of you. Are you still mad at me? For what? Because I left you and married Joe. I'll be disappointed if you said you weren't mad. I wonder how you really felt about me. Are you guys doing well? I'll answer that next time. The girl back there was cute. You think she's cute? You're really generous. Many odd couples eventually become lovers. I'd rather die! Hello? Are you buying things again? Miss, cash or credit card? No, I'm not. Listen, don't buy things left and right! Every time a mood swing… sends you on a buying spree. No, I'm not buying things. About the thing we discussed earlier… Why bringing it up again? How can I work in a bad mood? I need to make money! Okay… it's my fault, I'm sorry. I'm busy, got to go. Hello? Miss, the total is $1,850. I don't want them anymore, thanks. - Cutie pie! - Cutie pie! - Sorry, have you waited long? - No Where should we go eat? Let's order out something and go to my place. All right! Cutie pie, I love you. - Sis! - Sis! You're back! Your dad and I saw this new apartment this morning. We really liked it, so we put down the deposit. You'll pay for the mortgage. The real estate market won't see another crash… The market is stable now. Take out all the money in your account tomorrow. I need them for the down payment. Karen? Hold on. Sis, it's Karen! I'm getting married! The banquet is on the 12th of next month. Congratulations, Karen. Karen is getting married. Hello, Karen? I remember the bankbook was in your jacket's pocket… Don't put things everywhere, you'll lose them. Yes… We'll be there… Yes. What is it? Congratulations, Karen. Karen… This is uncle! Congratulations… I think Kinki is a few months older than you. Where's the banquet going to be at? We'll be there… we'll play a few rounds of mahjong. I sent in my order 8 a.m. Monday morning. You were still asleep, how can you say the goods are yours? It's obviously your fault. Don't expect me to help you on this one. Bullshit! You sent in your order first? I have black and white. I saw Sonny stamping my order with my own eyes. Then it's obviously your fault. Don't expect me to help you on this one. I don't know what he's trying to pull. Think about it, Ronald. Is it the Taiwanese or the Malaysian client more important? It's obviously your fault. Don't expect me to help you on this one. So I should just drop everything and serve your client? Come on, Andy, this company has its system. It's obviously your fault. Don't expect me to help you on this one. Ronald… Is that all? Anything else? Should we just ignore the "urgent" stamp and the serial number? What do you mean? Sales Dept. always fought over the goods. Remember the meeting last November? It was agreed any order to be sent out within 48 hours… will require an "urgent" stamp. But when everyone abused the system, it was agreed in another meeting, that any order will require computer serial numbers. My paper's got everything, and yours? "System". It's obviously your fault. Don't expect me to help you on this one. So what's the right procedure? Oh no! This is serious! Kinki! The babies are having it out inside me. I'm afraid they could get hurt. What if they're born deformed? I need to get an X-ray done. - Please handle the Guangzhou client for me. - Okay. But finish the Shenzhen case first. Didn't you handle Southeast Asia when you worked for Martin? A company in Singapore sent in an order, take care of it. Oh. Please give these to me before 5. Before 5? Mr. Cheung. Thanks. Good morning. Come any later and you can go work in night clubs. I played mahjong with clients last night and lost money. I already met my monthly quota, don't be picky! Fine! From now on no one will have to entertain the clients. Starting next month, your entertainment allowance is cancelled. Don't get it? Just ask her. I was kidding, don't take it seriously. I am serious! When I tell you when to come to work, and what jobs to do, I mean what I say! - Boss! Race 3, "Extra Power"! - Thanks! Ming! What's good? Bull penis. - Bull penis. - Yes. It's a secret recipe. It'll blow you away. Sounds special! Give me an order! One's not enough! How about two? It's okay… just one fist. "Extra power"… Knock it off, hurry up. - Have some tea. - Thanks! Here's the special part for you. Enjoy! Enjoy. What a coincidence! I hope you won't lose it. Don't eat that! Or I'll lose it. Miss, your purse… Miss, here's some more… Thanks. How much? Sorry… What are you looking for, Miss? It's small, with patterns, and has a plastic wrap… What is it? My love amulet. It's small, with patterns, and comes in a plastic wrap? It's small, with patterns, and comes in a plastic wrap… Thanks. Nope. Thanks! I'm going out for a meeting, be back later. Take care of the orders from Taiwan for me. Tony… want me to take your friends to horse races? Sure! Just introduce Mr. Yung to me. Make sure you don't get too close to Andy. Why? He's a notorious womanizer! His wife couldn't stand his bad habit and divorced him. He has a another home around here, the Edinburg motel. No wonder! What do you mean? I saw him eating bull penis. It's disgusting! Mr. Cheung ate raw bull penis. It's because he can't get it up. I saw a doctor sticking needles on his "thingy". I heard he's practicing Kung-Fu. Mr. Bull Penis! Don't mention how long it is! No way! Go to the meat market and check it out yourself! I'll buy one for myself. That's why he can do it all night long. Everyone at the conference room now! We have a meeting… Let's go… Shenzhen's Mr. Ko called saying we didn't give him a quotation. He's very angry, and ordered from another manufacturer. Who handled this deal? None of my business. Is this a trial? I went to the doctor because of a bellyache. I gave the file to Kinki before I left. Sorry, Mr. Cheung, I forgot. See? She admitted it. I gave it to her. Did you give her your salary? It's not her fault, Mr. Cheung. I really forgot. Whatever! Tomorrow you'll go to Shenzhen to take care of it. Or I'll hold you responsible for the losses. Meeting adjourned. It's two hundred grand! Thanks to you, I and my babies are doomed! I'm sorry. Don't leave yet! You know what "privacy" means? What's it to you what I eat? Why making up stories? What's this "Mr. Bull Penis" all about? I only told one person about it. Who is it? Say it! Are you stupid or really that naive? No one will thank you for what you did. Also, don't get involved with the Shenzhen deal. Ivy uses her pregnancy to take time off from work. I want to teach her a lesson. Understand? Yes. "Good morning, Mister." "Where's the nearest restroom?" Rainbow, make two copies for me. Grace. Get me a table at "Fu Ling" tonight. Okay. Where's Kitty? I'm here. And you, Ivy? The Shenzhen deal should've been taken care of today. Where's Kinki? She went to Shenzhen this morning. Cancel all my meetings. What's wrong with her? May I have your attention please, because of the recent swindle and extortion activities, please do not accept rides from strangers. Where are you heading? I have an address. My friend said I can get there by bus. This place? There are only 2 runs a day. You have to come earlier, or you won't get there till dark. Then how much is your ride? Don't worry about it! Give me whatever you like. Come… get in first. Let me help you. Want something to eat? No, I'm not hungry. Get in the car… I'm really sorry, Mr. Ko. I know you are a generous man. Here, this is good stuff, Davidoff. I think you'll like it. To be honest, Mr. Ko, it's okay if we don't make a deal, but I'd hate to lose a friend like you. In China, How many bosses are as practical as you, always looking out for newcomers like us? It'd be a shame to lose a knowledgeable friend like you. What's going on? You're a man of taste, Mr. Ko. No one appreciates this Chilean wine in Hong Kong. They just buy the expensive stuff. What are you blabbering on about? You're really smooth. Yes, right. I'm impressed! Your boss is lucky to have someone like you… No… We're just trying to make ends meet. Okay, I'll let it go this time. Go talk to the sales department, okay? Sure… It's boss like you that let us see the profit. Mr. Ko, my colleague came for you this morning. Did you see her? Really? Nobody was here. No? Did you ask her family? Try her mobile! Try again! What voice mail? Got better things to do? Keep trying until she replies. Andy, come here quick! Mr. Ko found her. She's at our factory. Thank you, Mr. Ko. Don't mention it, you should thank Mr. Chen. Thanks! Don't mention it… Let's have dinner together, Mr. Chen. I'm busy tonight. - Come on! - Some other time. Why was your mobile switched off? My phone doesn't have global roaming. Where did you go? "Shenzhen one-day tour"? No! I was duped by the taxi driver. He drove me all around the city, except to where I wanted to go. I was so scared. If it weren't for the police, I could've been a rape and murder victim. Don't you know better? How can you fall for that? It's not what I wanted either. First time here? Yes. Come more often and you'll get used to it. Move! You're in the way. Thanks… we'll do it another time. Bye! I thought you understood my words. I thought I told you not to come here. What did you think I said? Ivy's pregnant… I had to come. Go have a rest, we'll have dinner tonight… The food's here… Have some more, Mr. Ko… This is "Surf & Turf", the cat's inside. Kinki, have some wine. Let me take it. You can help her out, but don't forget to finish your own. Okay. Kinki. Have some chowder. It's good. - It's the "Wild Life Combo" chowder. - Let me take it. Again? Then have this snake gall bladder. All right! Kinki, this is turtle claw. Let me take it. Again? Here… If you had turtle claw, you must eat turtle head too. This is what men need! You'll come in handy tonight. Kinki, here's dessert, sweet mashed beans. Okay! Let me take it. Impressive… Let's have some more. Kinki. Let me take it. Are you feeling sick? Nothing serious. Maybe you should've watched yourself earlier. If the both of us wouldn't drink, then who will? Who's going to give us business? If you don't meet your monthly quota, who's going to feel for you? What counts is the money. Are you really okay? I'm fine… Let me just sit down and take a breather. This is good stuff! Why don't you sit down? I'll be fine in a while. In fact I envy you. You can take the day off and quit whenever you want. Women have the luxury to choose. Men are not this lucky. No… Andy… About my resignation… It's okay… I'll let you go. I'll feel better about it. Actually after I quit that day, I found out my family put down money on a new apartment. I have to pay for the mortgage. It costs $6,700 a month. It's a lot of pressure on me. So about my resignation, can I… Driver, stop the car. Pull over. Special news bulletin. We are live at the Edinburg Motel. Kinki is sitting in a cab, seems like she's waiting for someone. You need the clothes right away? If not I'll take them home with me. Or I can have the motel wash it. I don't need them now. Then I'll take them with me. Sure. Good girl. The mystery guy has appeared. Kinki, want to go up and take a quick shower? I want to go home and change. No, we have to go. The Shenzhen deal still needs much work. We'll finish that first. The adulterous couple took the taxi heading to the office. This is Rainbow reporting live. Everybody, here's the latest! Andy and Kinki spent the night together. They started foreplay in the car. They're the same in the office, even doing S/M. Andy's always like this. Kinki flirted with all the guys in the office. Someone saw them coming out from a motel yesterday. How disgusting! I knew they were up to something. I just didn't say a thing. Just look how intimate they are together… The nibbling and the giggling… Grace, come in here! I told you this before, She looks like a slut. Can you see it now?! Kinki, now that you're "promoted", don't forget me. Was he good in bed? Had a good time last night? See? Don't underestimate this girl. You know how they are. It'll go away in two days. Who did you hear it from? Who was it? Ivy. No, I heard it from someone else. Tell me! Alan. Serena! Sie. Catherine. Kitty. Rainbow. Come with me! Did you see me sleeping with her with your own eyes? No… So you made up stories? I'm sorry, Andy. Don't say sorry to me, I'm a man, these rumors won't ruin me. But Kinki's a girl. I didn't mean it. It's not the first time this has happened. If you like gossiping so much, why don't you quit your job and go work for the tabloids? Give me another chance, Andy. I'm sorry, Kinki! Forget it, Andy. I don't want you going around spreading rumors. I won't ever again. Andy will do anything for Kinki! I heard it was Kinki who broke up Andy's marriage! Her belly may look the same, but she's pregnant. I heard Andy and Kinki just had their child. It weighs 8 lbs. But the baby looks more like Ronald. Who is this? Aren't you Martin? Who's this? Idiot! 'Morning, Mr. Cheung! I promised to let you go, you can gather up your things. Relax, I won't withhold your salary. I'll notify the human resources dept. I'll answer that! Go back to your desk. It's okay. Yes? How much do you need, Mr. Ma? I'll check it for you. They need to be shipped out tonight? Sure… I'll take care of it for you, bye! Why can't the others come to work earlier? I'll give you a hand, Andy! It's okay, go back to what you're doing. What's the password? Thanks. What? I… the mortgage. What? Why don't you let me stay for another month? It'll save you the hassle with the human resources dept. Okay, sit. I'm not familiar with checking order papers. Take your time! Hello… yes Fiona, why do you sound like this? Where are you? I'll come right away. My friend's in trouble, I need to go check on her. When you're done, remember to… Call Mr. Ma. You're pretty cute when you don't lose it. Mr. Cheung is not here, who is this? This is his mobile. He didn't take it with him. You're his sister? Family emergency? Sure! I'll tell him when he comes back. Does it hurt? Why did he hit you? Joe's business is not doing well. He drinks when he's upset. I can't take it anymore! What's your plan now? Are you still in love with him? I'll answer that next time. Kitty. How is she? Not feeling well? It's so obvious they're having an affair. Have the neighbor look after the kids, take your mom to the hospital. Andy. How is she? She just had an EKG done, nothing serious. But the doctor wants her to stay here for a couple of days. How about your kids? You called the maid? I fired her. Then what? This girl Kinki from your office is helping me out. Kinki? She's a good girl, don't let her down. Okay, have a rest. I was at a loss when I received news about mom. Good thing she came to babysit them. The kids are really sound asleep. They must've had a wild time. I'm impressed. You managed to control the two little monsters. Actually, it wasn't easy. Thank you. Don't mention it. What's up? What is it? I don't know how to say it. Ignore him for a few days and he'll come crawling back. That's how men are. I saw him with another girl with my own eyes. I'm glad I picked on him last time. Let it go, find another guy. But I always catch my boyfriends with other girls. 4 times already! Men take advantage of you because you don't stand up to them. I'm useless. Sorry! Use my shoulder. For what? To cry on! I won't cry. Just let it out! Why should I cry for no reason? It feels worse holding it inside. Let it out! Don't be afraid, my shoulder's quite comfortable. Okay… Okay! It's okay… Take it easy… Dan? What were you? I couldn't find you anywhere. I've got time, let's go to the movies. I don't want to see a movie. We'll have dinner then, meet me in front of my office. I don't know, how about another place? I want Indian food. What's so good about curry? Let's have pizza. Then forget it. We'll talk later. Fine then, where should I meet you? 7:30, at this Indian restaurant on Wyndham St. I'll see you there. Don't worry, men are like this. The nicer you are to them, the more they take things for granted. Women should have more self-respect, and know how to create surprises, let's go. Why so early? The date's at 7:30. I'll help you with your wardrobe. But I don't wear revealing dresses. I know! I just want to change the color a little. You look like you're dead in black. There he is! Which one? The one with short hair. Can you speak English? I see. Two. What are you doing? I think he saw us. How can he see you from there? Make him wait for a while. Usually he would keep me waiting for half an hour. It's him! This is Kinki, sorry I can't take your call right now. Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you. Where are you? I'm waiting for you. It's time to go in, or else he'll leave. Take this. Will this work? I'm worried. Don't worry, I'll tell you what to say, and what to do. What's wrong with you? Your late! Ignore him and take off your coat. Thank you! Run your fingers through your hair. Give a seductive stare. I've waited you for a long time, I still have drawings to complete tonight. Go if you're busy. Go if you're busy! I was worried that something could've happened to you. - I love you, you know that… - Now yawn. Get the waiter. "Shajahani Thali" I'll teach you how to eat the dish, don't worry. Me too, "Sha-la-la", same… You look different today. Nibble your ear. You look dazzling! Touch your neck. And the perfume… Fondle your bra strap. Hold on Kinki, I have another call. Where are you? Central. That's perfect! I'm at H.C., can you come here? But I'm busy right now. Last time you asked me if I'm still in love with Joe… You want to know the answer? Hold on. An artist needs his personal creative space. Touch his hand. But it's different when two people live together. It could spark more inspiration. Kick his feet. Bite your lip. I didn't know a slim girl like you could be pretty sexy. Hold on… My client is flirting with me, and I can't tell him off. What? I'll come right away, are you okay? He just stepped out, should be back any minute. I'll be there in 5 minutes. Don't hang up just yet, let's chat. Kinki, I'm busy at the moment. You take care of him. What should I do? He won't leave with the way you're turning him on. Just believe in yourself. Yes, what's up? I'm busy right now, we'll talk later. I won't argue with you, it distracts me from work. I need to work! We'll talk later. It's Peter that moron. I bought a couple of new CD's. Let's go to my place and put them on. I love you! Save it for you and your cutie pie! "I love you!" How much is the payment? I'll answer that next time. Okay. Your friend from work? I'll be right back. How did it go? I dumped him. Are you all right? Yes. Then join us for a drink. No, it's okay. This is yours, I'll go now. Sure you're okay? Watch it, lady! You could get killed running around the street like this! Idiot! I think she likes you. Nonsense! It's hard having broken up with someone. You feel sorry for her? What are you getting at? That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Hurry up, I'm waiting for you. Take the subway if there's a traffic jam. Is the contract on the way? My boss is getting impatient. She'll be here soon. Help me to stall him. You have the beauty and the wisdom. - Help me. - Roger Young's here! Who is Roger? Founder of America's largest internet server, "Young Cool". He's good looking, and is worth over 20 billion dollars! To have him laying his eyes on you is better than winning the lottery. You'll have to excuse me, I need to add some make-up. Sure. You too? Who knows what his preference is? I may get lucky. That's true. This way please, Mr. Young. Just call me Roger. Impressive! Still not here? My boss is going to the airport. She'll come soon. It's the traffic jam, believe me. Maybe we'll talk this thing over when my boss comes back. - No. - Andy. What took you so long? It's here. You boss can read it on the plane. Get up, let's go. I sprang my ankle. Which foot? Both. You stumbled your way here? I'll carry you. No, thanks. No, you look awful lying here like this. Here! Let me carry you. Remember, don't eat anything oily, and don't get your ankles wet, or you could get arthritis. Have a good rest. I'll go now. Take the day off tomorrow if you still don't feel well. I'll tell the office. Are you her boss? Yes, I am sorry, this is all my fault. It's okay… Kinki said you're the company's top sales manager. Do you make two hundred grand a month? Put down your briefcase, I'll bring you some tea. We have desserts too. Care to sit for a while? I have business to attend to, please let go. We have everything here, like beer and soda. The doctor said she'll be fine in a few days, don't worry. We're not worried, where do you live? At the Castle Peak Road. Do you own a two thousand square foot house? Yes. Put down your briefcase and have some tea. Make yourself at home, have dinner with us. We have good food tonight. We can put another set of chopsticks. I'm busy… I have to go. There's also sweet mashed beans! Are you married, Mr. Cheung? Any girlfriend? Is slim, down-to-earth girl your type? My girl, he's a good investment. My calculator shows that he's worth over 10 million. He's better looking than Dan. Who cares about that punk? This one is better. You crazy! Good, he's okay, not bad. Are you serious? He's good. Really! Are you attracted to Kinki? What? Why would you pick him against the studs we saw earlier? You think those were good looking? You think he's a stud? Of course. No doubt. Thanks. Many people said the same. When can you introduce a girl to me? In your dreams! He's asking you, answer him. Go home and wait. Do you have my number? - Yes. - Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Cheung. - Good morning. - Good Morning! Are you free tomorrow? I'll take you to dinner. Dress nicely. Are you free tomorrow? I'll take you to dinner. Dress nicely. You're back? Feeling better? Dinner tomorrow night? Yes. Dress nicely? Yes. I'll pick you up at your place at 7. Hello? What is it? You'll look prettier in a blue suspender. You can use my wonder bra, it's really sexy. Yeah sis, I tried it and it works. Nonesense. Don't listen to them. Men over 30 are attracted to women's feet. Wear a short skirt. Try mini skirt. That's won't work! She's too slim. Why don't you put on a suit? You'll look sharp in it. But that covers up her body. Why don't you wear something exposing? Or I can lend you my school uniform. A lot of men like that. Yeah… why not a nurse uniform? Is this your evening dress? I think it's nice. Let's go. Have a good time! It's okay to come home late. Don't come back if it's too late, we'll lock the door after midnight. Sis, I know you can't drink, but if someone asks you to, be polite and have some. Yeah, and go to his place if you have time. We'll have Italian food tonight. I like how you said that. I like how you said it yesterday. Let's call this off. Why? You don't like the way I dress? That's not it… In a while the guy… What guy? The guy you'll be introduced to. Why are you introducing me to a guy? Fiona wanted to do this. I didn't think it was a good idea. But don't worry, I met him. He's not bad. Kind of cute with his chubby body. What's wrong with you? Why losing it again? If you don't like it… I can… Yes… We're almost there… Yes… You blocked my car! What the hell! Why would you do this? Don't get mad, it wasn't my idea. Is this really what you want? Might as well go and get it over with. Kinki! Kinki! How many, miss? …that cocktail I had last night really knocked me out. Where's Andy? I don't know! Hi, sit. Let me introduce you guys. Awesome! It's the Boxer helmet! I also have one in silver. What bike do you ride? Is it a full-fairing? V-4 engine. Is it outside? Let me see it! Sure, let's go! This is so cool! Upside-down fork, steel-braided brake lines, short-wheelbase chassis, even the cogwheel is modified. Where's the chubby guy? You don't think he's as good-looking? Who is he? How did you meet him? I met him at Ian Kwai Fung last night. Then why introduce Kinki to a stranger? Don't worry, they'd make a good couple. Who says I'm worried? Excuse me, sir. Gone… Will they come back? Her purse is still here, order a drink. What would you like, sir? Where did you go? What a rush! I'm going to his place. Sir? Yes? What do you drink? Oolong Tea. Are you trying to upset him? For what? Pass the car… Seems to me you like him. Yeah. Are you trying to upset him? What upset him? Switch gear! Is it because he set you up on a date? Yes, he's out of his mind. Are you mad at him? What mad at him? Go faster… Sit tight! Joe went to Taiwan. Really? I want to go to your place. Sure. Where are we going? Your place! Did you hear what I say? You said "sure". This is the American edition. Awesome! I had to special order it. It's not available in Hong Kong. I can tell you're a rich brat. The house belongs to my aunt. It's even worse to live off of people. Piaggio pattern! I've never seen it before. My aunt takes good care of me. So? What's your plan after school? She can't take care of you forever. I quit Harvard after two years. How can you quit school, especially Harvard? It's Cupid Express's bike from "A Moment of Romance"! I can try to get you a job. I do web sites. Why jump on the bandwagon? That's bubble economy, you won't make any money. "Young Cool", ever heard of it? Yes. But those web sites are about the same. I think a man must have a career, Just like Andy, for example. Let's go for another ride! Sure! What are you doing? Doing what I've always done. No one's here. Why is it so noisy? Get a condom. What are you doing? I'm getting a condom. Are you making a call? Why would I make a call? Who are you calling? Who am I calling? This is Kinki, sorry I can't take your call right now. Please leave your name and number and I'll get back to you. Still going to say you don't like Kinki? No, I'm just worried about her. Riding motorcycle can be dangerous. Listen to me… don't get mad! Kinki! Kinki! Good morning. - Good morning! - Good morning! Why are you late? You know what time it is? It's not 9 yet. Right, it's not. I usually come back earlier. Come with me. What now? Are you wearing the same clothes from last night? No, I'm not! What "no"? Did you go home? I wore pants yesterday, and the jacket was blue. Really? How was the guy? The guy from last night. You mean Roger? He's a pretty good biker! It was so exciting sitting in the back! I felt like I was the girl in "A Moment of Romance"! You think he's good? Too bad he's a slacker. A slacker? That's right! He didn't even finish Harvard. Do you know what he does? Yes, he does web sites, "Yah-ooh" or something. It's a waste of time! Let's say… hypothetically, that he has a great career and is wealthy, what will you say? I'll consider him. - That is all. - He's a really good biker! Can you spot the difference? No. This is the Super CPU. Our Japan head office used 5 years, hundreds of researchers, and millions of dollars to design this. This was found at a factory near Jiang Men. It only takes a few hundred dollars to produce this knock-off. - Ronald… - What? This is from Japan. The other's from Jiang Men. Really? Sure, I'm sure. You handled our deal in Jiang Men. We lost billions of dollars because of one small order. It's obviously your fault. Don't expect me to help you on this one. So which is the real one? Martin. Does your team need more people? That's right! Why did you dig up old order papers? It's obvious Ronald and Martin want to get me in trouble. Welcome to KFC, may I help you? One Mini Bucket Meal. Spicy or plain? Plain please. It's for take out. Martin has always handled our client in Jiang Men. I took over when he was out of town, but it wasn't long. You can check the company's computer records. Think they haven't thought of that? The files are already deleted. I can only search past order papers for any record. Or else I'm screwed! Please come again. Go home and pack your things. Why? It could take a few days. Sleeping over at your place? Just the two of us? Is it okay? I'll lock the door. Any more napkin? There should be some inside. You believe in this too? What? I had one like this before, but it was gone. What did you write? What do you want your girlfriend to say to you? I don't know. It's okay, you'll spoil your wish if you say it. Don't put it there. The temple says it won't work unless you hang it up. Don't put it there, it's so cheesy! It brings luck to your romance. It's worth it. - Let's hang it up, okay? - Whatever I only ate a few pieces but I'm so full. Just a few? You had the whole bucket! What is this? This? It keeps the papers organized. Sorry, his dad just came back from the States. I promised to have dinner with him. It's okay, go have fun. I can finish it if I don't sleep for 2 days. Maybe I shouldn't go. That's not good. See if you can get out of it. I'll tell him when he comes. This is awesome! Nitrogen suspension system, Dog Fight exhaust. It's got "Dog Fight" tires, and a new damper! - It's so cool! - My mom and dad. - Uncle, auntie. - Hello! Hello! So you are Kinki, wanna hop on? Yes! Of course! Roger, you'll take mom. Let's go for a ride. Whoever loses will pay for dinner. Sure, I won't let you win! Be sharp! So much for turning it down. 97 Accord, factory tires, PMG engine, leather seats. And a two-days old scratch mark. Am I smart? Yes! Am I attractive? Of course! In what ways? You are career-driven and mature. You are good-looking and have a kind heart. And you own a house and a car. Compared to Roger of "Young Cool", who'll you pick? Roger. Of course Roger! Roger… What's up? I saw my lawyer today and filed for divorce. Any drink? - Black Label. - Okay - With ice please! - Sure. You thought it over? I don't want to live in a hotel. Can I go to your place? I… …don't think that's a good idea. Is it because of Kinki? I dropped by your place earlier today and saw her there. We had work to do. I have a question for you. If it was the end of the world, who would you want to be with? I'll answer that next time. No! Answer me now. Let me ask you this then, what are my strong points? You're career-driven and mature. You are good-looking and have a kind heart. And you own a house and a car. Between me and Roger you'll choose… You! I mean the "Young Cool" Roger, the millionaire! Do you mean the Roger I introduced Kinki to? That Roger is this Roger! Black Label with ice. What are you good for? Buy me a used car, Albert. A motorbike, a full-fairing. "Learner's Plate" Damn it! Had enough fun yet? So what if I suck? So what if I fell? At least I'm trying to learn! Is it so fun to pick on people? Just to say "Hi"! The way you roar the engine… that's "Just to say hi"? Have you considered how others may feel? Do you know you could frighten people? What's so cool about riding a full-fairing? All you know is picking up chicks. "It's so cool, what a rush!" "It's awesome!" Just like "A Moment of Romance"! You've got all the girls. What more do you want? Sorry, let's go! Here you go. When will we meet again? No. Not from now on. Why did you imitate me? Making fun of me? What? "It's so cool! What a rush!" Anyway, let's get started. It's Roger. You can see that? Sure, it's obvious. Does he have better things to do? These fake magazine covers are not trendy anymore. But this is a pretty good knock-off. It's even got the contents. What word is this? "Nasdaq". National Association of Security Dealer Automatic Quoting System. One billion, how many zeros is that? That's a lot of zeros! That's ridiculous! Where did you get this? I bought it. So this is real? I just told him I won't see him again! Can you help Andy out? What's wrong? He's accused of selling our product to a pirate manufacturer. How do you want me to help? I don't know. So? Daddy, mommy. What's your relationship with Andy other than work? Is it "something"… Yes, it's "something". Then how long have you and him "something"? Not too long, I just realized it myself. - Faye, go get the luggage. - Alfred, get the car ready. You have a solution? Cindy, I'm leaving Hong Kong. Have the tickets ready. I'm afraid Andy won't have time to explain himself to the company. Alan, call Bill in the States for me. Tell him the joint venture is off. I know, I know the stock will drop, and we'll stand to lose a lot of money. Okay, that's all, bye. Shouldn't we just talk to the Japan head office? Helen, have my lawyer call me. Is it that serious? - We're ready, let's go! - Let's go, Roger. We'll talk in the car. - Let's go. - We'll talk in the car. Where are we going? I want to have it in Miami. I'll meet you there, Patrick. I want it to be as grand as possible. The guest list? I'll fax it to you shortly. Prepare me an 80 million-dollars budget. Okay… thanks! I'm sorry, Roger, I didn't know it was going to be this serious, and costing so much money. It's okay… we're all friends. Right! Don't worry about money. Relax, just relax. Hold on, Alan. Kinki, where do you live? 60 Tin Kwong Rd. Go to 60 Tin Kwong Rd. And pick up Kinki's family for me. There's no need for luggage, just the passports are fine. Go now. What's this to do with my family? Why no luggage and just the passports? Leave things to Roger, he knows what he's doing. Do you trust in him? You don't? - Good then. - Relax… I'm here Simon, bring me the contract over. Where do we go now? Just relax… Kinki! What a coincidence! Turns out you're quicker than any of us! Your wish finally came true, I envy you! What do you mean? You're so lucky, Miami is a very romantic place! Why are you all here? There's more. Rebecca is flying in from Toronto. Hello! - Congratulations! - Thanks Are you getting married? Why didn't you tell me? Who's the bride? Get on the ship and you'll know. What's the mystery? I can guess it myself. If you invited the bride's friends, you'll have to invite her family. Kinki! You must be our in-laws. - Yes… - Nice to meet you… What in-laws? What is going on? You're not marrying my sister, are you? Thanks! This is the prenuptial agreement. It details how much you'll get for marrying me, and for having our kids. Andy, I blew it… I thought Roger could solve your crisis. But out of the blue he says he likes me, and wants to marry me in Miami. My parents are here now, so are my friends. Everyone tells me to marry him, what should I do? Please come! The ship leaves at 5. Help… There are so many people here! Wait for me… Don't get on the ship. He's as hot as the Blue Chips. I calculated everything he owns. My calculator ran out of digits. Don't hesitate, sis. He's so good-looking. My girl, our remaining lives rest on your decision. So are our future generations. And so are the entire Chinese population. What's so good about Andy that our son can't match? Does he make more money? He makes two hundred grand a month, how's that enough? Forget money and let's talk about character. Why was Andy divorced? It's because he's nasty, sleeping with hookers. What's so good about men like this?! How can you choose Andy over Roger? I find this insulting. Kinki, it's okay whether if you'll pick me. But can you tell me your reason? Yeah! What's your reason? Say it! Say it, sis! Why don't you say it? Say it! I don't know what to say. What's wrong? Please help me. Do you need help? The train station? The dock? Or the airport? The dock. Hop on! My friend, cherish the girl you're in love with. When I was in the Triad, I fell in love a girl from a rich family. She gave up everything for me. But I left her. She was in her wedding gown looking everywhere for me. She was heart-broken. I too regretted my decision. I don't want people to be like me. So I'm on the road everyday helping them to retrieve lost love. I hope they'll find their ever-lasting love! It only took a minute. The rest is up to you. What's your name, my friend? Call me Cupid Express. Unbelievable! The ship left already, it's too late. Kinki! Ronald awaits you in the conference room, hurry up. Breaking news… Andy is leaving. Ronald, Andy just quit. Then he'll take the wrap for us! Of course! Hold it… Give me a hand, Andy. Grace gave me these. They might contain records of Ronald's dealings in Jiang Men. Andy… Don't try anything! Give them to me! Give me, Kinki… Let go! Come on Kinki, gimme! Gimme… Let me… Don't worry… Let me…! Help! Hand it over! Help me, Andy, or they'll snatch the file. They'll find it! It's okay! Oh shit! Oh no! Damn! Don't just stand around, look for the file! Whoever finds it will be the next manager. What matters is you're back. Yesterday when you were at the dock, I couldn't see what you wrote clearly. Can you tell me what it says? I… you. What? Say it…
