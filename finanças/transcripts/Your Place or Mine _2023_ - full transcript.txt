Mmm! I can't believe... That's so cool. You own your own house. Oh, yeah. Well, I saved up for the down payment over, you know, some time. I put money away through careful calculations. Nice. Amazing. When I destroy my life, can I move in with you? - Deal! - Amazing! - Whoa! Look at all those books! - Yeah, I'm a big reader. Are you? That's great. I... Yeah, I'm gonna be a big writer one day. - What? - I want to be. Okay, I bet you will be. How did you get to be so awesome? You know you don't have to say any of this? - I'm gonna sleep with you anyway. - Unbelievable! I'm gonna send you my short stories in the morning. Great. Mmm. I think you'll like them. - Mm-mmm. Okay. - Okay, I'll stop talk... - Just be quiet now. Yeah. - I'm sorry. ♪ Whoo-hoo ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ Yee-hoo ♪ - I've actually written 23 short stories. - Oh, God, just stop. Good morning. Good morning. Happy birthday, much younger person. What? We're the same age. Not in lady years. In lady years, I'm a crone, and somehow you'll still be considered sexy at, like, 70, no matter how wrinkled and bald you get. - Yeah. - So congratulations. I'll admit it. It's a good deal. Oh, I got you the greatest birthday present. You got me a Porsche? A 356? No, the 911 in purple, right? Do you want coffee? Uh, yeah, thank you. You know what? Let me call you back. You said you didn't need me to bring you anything in New York, but do you have any herb plants? What? You know, herb plants? Never mind, I'll just pick some up. You pop them in the windowsill and then you have fresh basil or mint anytime you need to cook with it, or eat it, or just smell it. Okay, Debbie, please do not bring soil into my apartment. I'm begging you. Big shocker, you listen to The Cars in the morning. - Morning, noon, and night. - Oh, I wanted to mention, when I'm at your place, if you wanna have somebody over, and you want me to get out of the way, I can do that, so you can… Okay, now I'm feeling uncomfortable. Oh, please, I've seen you naked. - Never stops being weird. - Which is so weird. Thank you. I think I can control myself for one week. You... You never know, maybe you'll meet someone while you're here and we'll have a big ol' sex party up in here. - Uh, barf? - Yeah, I'm sorry, that was gross. Anyway, no chance of me meeting anybody. As you know, my heart is a cold, hard little stone. I'm so glad you're not being dramatic about it. By the way, I am so proud of you for being cool about leaving Jack for a whole week. I'm not being cool about it, I'm having a panic attack. He's my baby. I've never left him for that long. - Hey. - Ah, the creature awakens! - Morning. - Morning. - Can I eat this? - Yes, it's gluten-free. - Also, say hi to Peter. - 'Sup, Peter? Hey! 'Sup, Jack-O'-Lantern? - What? - Oh, I'm working on nicknames. No? No, he didn't like it. - Go back to the drawing board on that one. - Look at him. He's not a baby. All right? He's gonna be fine. It's not like you're leaving him with a dog bowl and a chew toy. Right? Scarlet's gonna be there. You... You want my opinion? Just you saying that, I know exactly what your opinion is. Look, he's not my kid, but I think Jack could use the space. All right, notes on parenting from a guy whose only pet was a goldfish that died in a bong fire. Okay, look, I'm just saying. There's, like, helicopter parenting, there's snowplow parenting. What you're doing? This is Saran Wrap parenting. You're so tightly wrapped around this kid, you're suffocating him! Yes, I can track a metaphor, thanks. Okay, how excited are you that you and I are gonna be in the same city for a whole week? When's the last time we hung out that long? I don't know, 2008? When you left LA because you were scared of earthquakes. Okay, hey! The Chino Hills Temblor was no joke! Anyway, I know you have to go to work and I want to give you your present before you go. So I was cleaning out this drawer... You clean things out? Occasionally, I clean things out. And look what I found! I know you hate mementos. Yeah, no, I hate mementos above all mentos. Okay, hold on. Here's your present. Look. I put this in the end table the night you stayed over, because, I don't know, I thought it would be a keepsake at our wedding or something. That's how dumb I was in my 20s. - You weren't dumb. - I was a little bit dumb. Anyway, the best part of the whole night was when I took all your money! That was the best part? I mean, it overshadowed the sex part, because you fled the next day. - Wait, hold on. I did call you later. - Yeah, you did call me later. When you said that you couldn't date me or anybody else because you were, "an unknowable piece of shit"? Uh, mmm, there's the writer in me right there. Now that's a beautiful turn of phrase. And I'm the dramatic one? Anyway, 20 years of friendship. 20 years! Can you believe it? You've had the best best friend in the entire world. Back at you. Have a great birthday, Peter. I will. You're awesome. Okay, I'll see you in a couple days. Hey. Geez, I thought you and Debbie were gonna blab, like, forever. - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that. - So, what were you talking about? - Like, just stuff. - "Stuff"? Okay, so your best friend, who's a woman who I've never met, just calls you on your birthday and you, like, talk forever? Okay, it's not "a girl," it's Debbie. Okay, obviously, I'm not jealous. I mean, look at me, but it's just weird. Becca? I mean, if you like each other so much, why aren't you guys together? Me and Debbie? Yeah, 'cause. - Because… - She's… her. And I'm me. Uh-huh. Oh, look at that. Should we get to work? Uber's here. - You look great today. - Uh-huh. - Okay, tonight… - Mm-hmm. …at the Brownstone Club, do not tell them it's my birthday. They'll make a big fuss out of it, and I just want it to be you and me. Peter… Yes? What happens next? Like, wha... After dinner? I... I mean, I enjoy their flan. Yeah, no, I... I mean with us. I mean, we've been together for six months, and… I just feel like we're not really getting any closer. - I mean, I don't know that much about you. - Yes, you do. - Uh… - I... Look, I'll tell you anything. I'm an open book. Look, if this is a waste of my time, I just want to know. Okay? Define "waste." You just did. Wow. Happy birthday. No! Come... Come on. - It's over, Peter. - It... It's… And she took the car. - Okay, did you take your antihistamine? - Check. - Nasal spray? - Check. Good! Good to go! - Morning, team! Hey! - Oh! Ladybugs are kicking some ass in the garden out here. You guys do the same. Have a great one. - Right back at you, Zen. - I'll be right here!

Okay, don't forget... You gotta be kidding me, Mom. That's so embarrassing. Do you still hang out with Wade? Hi, Wade! - Mom! No. - What? - What? He's one of my students! - Gosh, you're not a teacher. Technically, I work here. Let me get your lunch. Um, you guys used to hang out all the time. He used to come for sleepovers. Here, let me put this in your bag. Didn't he pee on our sofa once? Mom! What? He did! - Hey, girl. Hey. - Oh, my God, hey. Do you want to have some of my terrible office coffee? - I have this. - Oh, okay. - But, yes, of course. - Well, let's do it. - Uh, so, are you packed? - Yes, I am packed. I have to say, I am so glad you're finally taking a vacay. What? A... No, I am not going on vacay. I have explained this to you! I have to finish this program before the end of the year so that I can apply for that open Senior Accounting position at the Regional School District. Oh, I love it when you say a bunch of sexy words like that. Yeah, I just... I need the money. Jack's eczema medicine is only gonna be covered by my insurance for the next six months, and then it's, like… - One thousand dollars. - Yes! One thousand GD dollars a month! So, no, not a vacay. All right, all right. Well, I just hope that when you're in New York, you will take time to do something nice for yourself. Maybe take a bath. Relax. That's what I love to do when I travel, I like to take a bath, and not hear either of my kids yell, "I'm hungry!" Are they just always hungry? - Well, never feed 'em, so… - Ever? Wait, why can't Jimmy come here to watch Jack? It's peak climbing season. He has to be out there. Oh, my God, you are so nice about him. If my ex was a mountain climber and spent ten months out of every year traveling the world with some hot 33-year-old covered in tattoos… Have you been looking at her Instagram? You think I'm not gonna be looking at Jimmy's girlfriend's Instagram account? I mean, what are we even doing? Who would I even be? Look, it's fine. It works for him, it works for me. Besides, Jack loves hanging out with Scarlet. All right, well, I hope that you get what you want out of this trip. - Yes. - And what you need. You know, get your degree, find a man, come home, and then remodel that ancient kitchen of yours. I also think it's time to get layers in your hair. Layers, but not bangs. Bangs are for an emergency. Wow, you really have all the answers to my life figured out. Yeah, well, we're friends. Obviously, I have well-thought-out critiques of every choice you've ever made. And all the fixes. So, if you end up going on this Manhattan adventure and find yourself a hottie, might I suggest a manicure. Maybe get waxed. You know, spruce it up a bit. Waxed? Oh, my... - Oh, "waxed." - Waxed. Oh, well, that's just not gonna happen. I beg of you, sir! Please, don't hurt me! No, no. Okay, don't... Don't judge that. Don't judge that. I'm gonna do it again. Okay. I beg of you, sir, do not hurt me! Was that good? - Incredible. - Hey, Scarlet. - Hey, Deb! Um... - What's going on? - Well, I got an audition! - What? Ah, yeah! It's for a TV series set in the '20s about this serial killer, and I would play a maid who gets strangled by the lead. Okay, can I try this out? Okay. I beg of you, sir! Please don't hurt me! I was being strangled. Did you get that? How was that? Honestly? Nailed it. I'm probably not gonna get this anyway 'cause I don't get anything. Hey, you never know. Um, listen, did you get the emails that I sent about what to do with Jack while I'm out of town? - Yep, yep, yep! We're on it! Right, Jack? - Yeah! - Deb, I gotta say, I'm so happy for you. - Oh! It's, like, really cool and inspirational, this whole accounting thing or... or whatever. It's so funny that you're a numbers person, 'cause I thought you liked books. So, I... Why aren't you doing something with, like, booky-books? Well, this degree is practical, which is what you have to be when you're a single mom. Oh, right. Right, right. Tragic. It's just such a waste. "A waste." Look, we know that our consulting period with you is up, but... Yeah, we were just hoping for a little more time to get to know you better. Guys, you know me so well. We spent so much time together over the last six months. Yeah, we did, and it's been… - It's been amazing. - Amazing. Um, you know, we're just wondering, what happens next? Next, I move on. I'm really sorry. Come with us. We just... We need a new CMO and it should be you, it's so obvious. - Yes! - Guys, I'm sorry. It's just not on the table for me. I... Look, look, don't be sad. Nope. It's fine. Yeah. No, I... This is just how it has to be. I don't know if I like you anymore. Oh, it's getting ugly. I knew it was gonna get ugly. You can, um, take my contact and erase it from your phone. I don't have it in my phone. Well, then put it in your phone and then erase it. - He's sorry. We're sorry. He didn't... - No, it's okay.

I rushed over here to tell you the news, because I love you guys so much, and I totally forgot that, of course, I'm supposed to be with Jack, because I'm a selfish butthole! - No! - Mm-mmm. What am I gonna do? What are we gonna do? It's fine. Totally fine. Doesn't seem fine. Seems loud. I'll finish the program next year. They don't offer it again until then anyway. Well, you seem kind of bummed out. It's okay. I'm an adult. A big part of being an adult is being bummed out. A lot of the time, really. Oh. That's something to look forward to. Yeah, and that's just why you have to be careful and you have to be cautious all of the time. - You're not answering? - No, he's gonna try and lend me money. - You don't know that. - Yes, I do. Hey, Peter. Tell her I'm not trying to lend her money. I said that. I'm calling because I booked a flight, Jackity-Jack. - Are you ready to hang? - Please, the nicknames. - Wait, what? - You're right. I'm shooting blanks with the nicknames. We'll work on that when I get there. - Hey, Debbie! - Wait, what? Oh, and I'm renting my own car, 'cause God knows whatever hell show you're driving, I want no part of. - Wait, what? - You're saying "Wait, what?" a lot. And it makes you sound kinda dumb. - I just don't... I don't understand. - Well, I'm coming to LA for a week. I'm gonna look after Jack, and you can stay here solo. Peter, come on. You can't just drop everything to come and babysit. You have a job and a life. I mean, I don't know about a life, but you have a job. Actually, I have, uh, some time off between clients, so we're all good there. It's not as much fun as us hanging out together, but gets you what you need. Peter, taking care of Jack is actually a lot of work. It... He's allergic to a billion things, like, he takes a bunch of medicine, and, honestly, he doesn't have a lot of friends right now. Let me help. I owe you. - Owe me? - Yes! Where was I when Jack was born? I was in London helping a Spanish bank launch a sister branch in Eastern Europe. But when my mom died, you drove from Los Angeles to freaking Ohio for the services. And you picked me up from rehab not once, but twice. Yeah, yeah, I... I... I know, I'm a really good friend, but I... I didn't do any of those things expecting something in return. Of course you didn't, 'cause you're not a monster. You need help. And I'm coming, and that's that. Okay. He's gonna be fine, right? Yes, it's only a week. It's only a week! I'm hugging a pair of pants. Mom, come on! We're gonna be late! - Need help? - No, no. I have a method. That's how I do it. Okay. You know, they make these, uh, zippy, little four-wheelers now. You barely have to push 'em. They call 'em "spinners." - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! All right.

Come on, it's no sweat. Honestly, I was between clients and, well… It's a short-term project, right? That's what I do. I get in, manage things, no muss, no fuss. I have bad news. Kids are all muss and all fuss. - Are they though? - Uh, yeah. - Very much so. - Oh. - Give it back! - We'll see. Those two, those are my girls. Okay. Oh, fun. They look fun. Oh, there's Jack.

She says they roll over too easily. Yeah, well, they're also awesome, so that negates the rolling part. Hey, let me ask you a question. Those kids back there, they were blowing you off. What was that about? Look, man. I was a 13-year-old boy once, all right? And I know I'm pretty cool now, but when I was 13 I was basically a walking Adam's apple with a bowl cut and a tattered copy of Catcher in the Rye under my arm, so… Plus, I didn't have a dad. He bailed on me when I was 13, then he died three years later, drunk in a ditch. He was walking along the side of the road and he just went "bloop." Oh, my God. So, seriously, whatever you're going through, I've probably seen worse, so you can hit me with it. - Well, give it to me, Jack Be Nimble. - I don't even understand that one. Look, I'm still workshopping, okay? It's because of hockey. Okay. Wade and I were friends, and we used to skate at the rink together, but now he plays on the team and I can't. So he hangs out with Evan, who does. So we just stopped hanging at all. Whoa, wait, you play hockey? Well, Debbie never told me that. Yeah. I can't play basketball 'cause I'm allergic to the gym, and I can't play baseball 'cause I'm allergic to grass. Wait-I don't understand why you can't play on the team with Wade and his weaselly friend. Oh, I'm sorry. He... He's probably not weaselly, but, like, he's got a weasel face. You know? So, but... Why can't you play on the team? I'm too small. Mom says it's too dangerous. I cannot believe your mom didn't tell me about this. Like, she tells me everything. But do you? Tell her everything? Of course. I never understood why Debbie decided to buy a house on the side of a whole entire hill. Yeah. I suppose you get used to it after a while, huh? No. It continues to suck. Who lived here before you, like, an alpaca? - Hey! - Hey! Oh! Yeah! Yo, Jack. You're the guy... You're the dude that's, uh, gonna be hanging with, uh, Jack. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Zen. Yeah, like the Buddhism. I live through the gate there, and, uh, I'm independently wealthy due to a tech buyout. - Of course. - I surf in the AM. Spend the rest of the day here in Debbie's garden. - What about your yard? - My yard? Oh, I don't do my yard, I got a guy for that. There he is. Hey! - Yeah? - Yeah! Dude, he's so funny. He's from Spokane. Okay. Well, it was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - Okay. - Bye, Zen. All right, back at it. - You didn't know about Zen? - Nope. So the whole thing where you and Mom tell each other everything... Yeah, no, we're not gonna... That's grown-up talk. Okay. Did she stay up all night doing this? Your mom's crazy. I am well aware. All right, let's, um… Oh, hey! I made it. I'm in Brooklyn. Are... Are you home yet? Did you see my Post-Its? - Yeah, they're kinda hard to miss, Deb. - Okay. The most important thing is that you feed him breakfast, then you pack his lunch, and then you pick up his prescriptions on the way to school. Uh-huh. Oh, and the other most important thing is that you get the list of things that he's allergic to. It's right by the coffee maker. - Oh! Excuse me. - Oh, wow. Laminated. Nice. - Oh, this one says "urgent." - Yeah. And I forgot to label the nut-free nut butter. But it's in there. It's in the… Do you... - Yeah. - I don't know what that is. Oh, and Jack, Jack, have you started your history paper? Already started it. Okay, that means he's done nothing, Peter. You have to remind him. Okay, he has to pick a thesis. He's doing the Spanish-American War, which is, I think, against Spain. - Yeah, Deb? - I'm not sure. - Jack is okay. - Oh, hi! Oh, my gosh. There are so many people here. It's crazy. We're gonna figure out dinner. Oh, no, you don't have to worry about it, because I left dinner. O... Open the freezer. - Wait, this also says "urgent." - Jack loves those casseroles. You know, I could... I could buy dinner. Peter, I know that you have a lot of money, but I really don't want you getting him take-out, and... and other things that are fancy. Yeah, okay! Homework, and then frozen… …for dinner. I know there's something else I forgot to tell you. Shoot, I forgot what I forgot to tell you. Debbie, stop. T... Take a breath. Look around. Yeah, enjoy it. - Call us later. - Okay. - You allergic to Mexican food? - No. Excuse me, pardon me. Uh, um, excuse me, I'm gonna go to Peter Coleman's. You know, they make those with four wheels now. They're called "spinners." Right, so… Got it. Oh, my God. This is gorgeous. Oh, my God. Whoa. What!? By color? Really? Oh, my God, Peter. Wait, where are the handles? How do you even open this? What is this? Oh! That's just sad. Peter. They still have stickers on them. Twenty-five dollars for a glass? Oh, my God. Peter. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Okay… what should we do? Well, I have homework that I should probably do. God, I just got here! What... It's... This is our night! It's our occasion! We're having a special... We're occasioning! - It's... That's not a word. - It is now! Let's... We can... We can watch a movie. Yeah, no. We have three remotes. Uh, can I see that? This one controls the TV and it makes sure the DVD player isn't on. - This one controls the sound. - Oh, yeah, I was gonna do that. It's all volume. This one controls the cable to make sure the Wi-Fi is working. And, oh, yeah. This one also is the receiver. Got that sequence. But I'm not supposed to watch TV while I eat. And never before homework. You poor child. Had I known what was going on in this house, I would have come a lot sooner. Thanks. You know, my mom always says you're kinda irresponsible. She calls you, "a rolling stone that gathers no moss." Whatever that is. She does, huh? Yeah, she also says you're terrible with women. Ah! Ah. Your mom! But I'm psyched you're here, 'cause you're chill. Chill. Oh, stop. Stop everything. That's the movie we're gonna watch. - Alien? - Yeah, have you seen it? - No, is it scary? - It's terrifying. Cool! Oh, no, that's not… Why is it so cold in here? Heat… Hmm… Heat! Oh! Ah… Oh! Hi. Uh, I'm sorry, I... I can't hear you. You just have to point at the sensor. Oh, my God. Thank you. Uh… Hi, I'm Debbie. Wait a second. Are you the Debbie? Peter talks about you all the time! Oh, yeah, I guess that's me. Um, who are you? I'm Minka, and I am a skosh embarrassed. I thought Peter was here and I am not wearing anything under this. - I figured that. - Yeah, I feel like an idiot. Oh, don't worry about it. We've all done the thing where we knock on the door half-naked for some g… So you and Peter are… We were. We used to. We broke up after six months and then he started dating this woman Becca, but through the careful study of her socials, I figured out they broke up. So I thought I would come over and… - So that is how you sit there. - By the way, where is Peter? Oh, he's staying at my place in LA. - And I'm just here for a few days. - Cute! Can I buy you a drink? No ulterior motive. I will not ask you why Peter is so emotionally, like, broken. Oh, I would love that, but, um, I'm starting classes tomorrow. I have to get up early. I'm doing this program, and… - Anyway, maybe some other time. - Yeah, sure! I will take you to the Brownstone Club. That's where Peter and I met. You know, you are great. I like you. I dig this whole sexy, Gen-X, Earth Mama thing you've got going on. Thank you. You're gonna party with Minka? She asked if maybe I wanted to go for a drink sometime. - Oh, fancy! - Right. - Hey, what are you guys doing tonight? - Um… - What did we do? Um, nothing special. - Oh, is he there? Does he want to talk to me? Uh, he's... he's actually doing his homework right now, so… Oh! Oh, that's good. Hey, uh, by the way, are you aware that there is a gentleman and his butt crack in your yard all ding-dong day? Oh, yeah, that's Zen. He just... He's around a lot. It's, uh... You know, he does a really great job with the garden and... and so I just let him do his thing. Um, did I not mention Zen? Yeah. No, no, you failed to mention that there is a man living in your yard. Um, Peter, I just want to say thank you. This place is amazing. - It's just comfortable and… - Really? No, not really. It's very, very empty. It looks like somebody stole all your stuff. Yeah, well, if they did, they brought it all here, 'cause you have all the stuff. Like, literally, all the things that are, were, and ever shall be, are here. Oh, really? Well, you don't have a photo or a knickknack. I don't do knickknacks. I don't buy them, like, ever. I have nixed the knickknacks. Oh, by the way, your books are all color-coded, which is… I mean, I knew New York had changed you, but that one hit me hard. Yeah, my decorator did that. That's just gross, and I can't believe you said it out loud. Also, you don't have any mementos from LA? No! You know my policy on mentos. So, let me ask you a question. I mean, I'm not trying to pry, but what happened with Minka? She seems like she's your type. She's so silky and sleek. Okay, what? She's not an otter. - What happened? - I don't know. I don't... You know me. I probably did something to screw it up. Oh, stop it. Yeah, well, let the fossil record show that I am terrible with women. In... In fact, some would say that I am "a rolling stone that gathers no moss." Uh, what? Oh, yeah, just so you know, your kid's a sieve, all right? So everything you've ever said about me, I'm about to hear. Okay, I didn't... I didn't say it like that. - Okay, yeah, I... I did. I said that. - Yeah. - But I think he misunderstood me. - Yeah, I'm sure. Right, look. It's getting late out there. You should go to sleep. And 'cause I have a list of things that's a mile long that was left here for me to do by a crazy person. "Goodnight," said the crazy person. Say bye to Jack. And I'll see you later on the interwebs. I'll find you later! - Goodnight. - Bye. So? Did I scar you for life? Who cares? That was dope! My mom would've never let me watch that.

Oh, thank you. - Can I get one of those? - No. - Check the laminated card. - No. - I'm not allergic to coffee. Come on. - You're not drinking coffee. Let's focus. These neti pots, and packed lunches, breakfasts, age-appropriate movies? Not my thing, not my strength, right? But that's okay, 'cause I'm here to focus on you. Okay, and my... my work here is very simple. It's to teach you to tell a story to other people about you that is better than the story that you tell yourself. 'Cause the stories we tell ourselves are very limiting. - I'm not following. What do you mean? - Okay, example. Look, let's take someone we both know, your mom. - Okay. - Your mom is the smartest person I know. Okay? When we first met, she was extremely ambitious. She wanted to be an editor, or whatever, but then over time, she started to believe that she had to be practical, and she had to be sensible, and that is the story that she told herself. "Be responsible." - So that's not your story? - No, co... Are we talking about me? Do you always answer a question with a question? Do you always answer a question to a question with a question? Did you really move to New York because of the earthquakes? - 'Cause my mom doesn't believe that. - All right, can we stay on message here? Okay, look, in the beginning of a rebrand, I like to do a thing called a "global realignment," all right? And that is a gesture to the world, in your case, Wade and Weasel Face… Evan, of what you have to offer. Today, you have to offer these. - Seats to the Kings game? - What are... These aren't seats. These are tickets to a luxury box. Isn't that bribing them to be friends with me? Ah, and this is where the rebrand comes in. So we're gonna rebrand the word "bribing" with "incentivization." That's not a word. In my line of work, we make up the words that we need. That's kind of sketch. Now you're getting it. There you go, "sketch." - Look at... Look at my sketch coffee. - I really want one of those. Hey, uh, remember, I'm gonna pick you up after school. - We're gonna go to that Kings game. Okay? - Yeah, okay. Got it. And we got the big private box so you can invite whoever you want. - 'Cause it's the luxury box. - Yeah. See you after school, Peter. We'll see you after school when we go to the Kings game! Yep, big game! Let's go! Yeah, with all that candy and ice cream! - Hey! Coffee? - You buying? Yeah. Oh! Oh, yeah, can we get one of those, uh… the butter coffees? - With the butter… - He's miming. He's miming. Yes, he is. - That's actually really good. - I've been working on it. ♪ We were embers ♪ ♪ Walked in a room and can't remember Why you're standing there ♪ ♪ Lost in a memory ♪ ♪ Just staring at an empty chair ♪ ♪ There was a fire But it faded in the afterglow ♪ ♪ We took the air out… ♪ Hi!

Oh, I know, but I find if I write it… - Hello, everyone. - …it goes in my brain… - Welcome to Statistics in Risk Modeling. - We'll talk later. Now, we got a lot to cover. So let's get started here. First, we're going to start by reviewing types of modeling problems and methods, including supervised versus unsupervised learning. You know, that was a lot of information. Do you feel like sometime, we could share notes, or…? - Hey! - Hey. Oh, my God, that class was so boring. Oh, hi! - How was your first class? - It was fine. Now, that drink we talked about, you in the mood? - Yeah, sure! - Great! I'm right near you. So, I'll come pick you up. See you soon! Bye! In this literature class, prepare yourself to do a lot of reading. We're gonna be tackling some big novels, I'm talking about the chunky ones. I'm talking some real door-stoppers. In this class, Anna Karenina is a pamphlet. I grew up reading Uris, and Clavell, and Michener. Haley! Do not forget Alex Haley. Never got over the thrill of reading a massive book with tiny, tiny print. Yes! Oh, uh… No, no, no. Sorry. How many of you have read Alex Haley's Autobiography of Malcolm X? Hands? Okay… Oh, hey, Miss Backpack! You ready? - That was fast. - Cute college. Right? I mean, I'm personally allergic to school. After I got the master's in differential calculus, I was like, "Enough!" You know? Okay, follow me. Did you say differential calculus? So funny. You ran, like, right into the practice station. Dude, it's not my fault the lace on my right skate snapped! Whoa! Look at these! - Dude! Jelly beans. - I love those! Those are my favorite! Dude, I think this is the cinnamon one that's super spicy. - Really? - You ever had the cinnamon Jolly Rancher? - The spicy one? - Yeah. Oh! I love those cinnamon… spicy ones! That's so spicy. I'm good. I don't really like those ones. Hey, hey, none of this stuff is on the allergy list, so you're good to go. So just go nuts, have at it. - Without eating any nuts. - I think that's actually licorice. Why aren't they talking to me? - Dots! - They will! They will. Don't worry about it. Let's go. We'll, hey, get a jersey or something. Let's get our kit on. Let's go. Go, Kings! Okay, I need a drink. Oh, yes. Let's have a drink! - For one, I'm so thirsty. - I know! Ooh! Okay. Wait a second. The... These people look really fancy. Yeah, you have to be someone or know someone, and I'm both. And also kind of neither. That's what's great about me. Oh, wow. Uh, I don't think I fit in here. I mean, obviously. But you're with me. Come on. Thank you, Petra! By the way, we do not have to talk about Peter. Oh, okay. Got it. Honestly, bro. - Yeah! - I mean, he had it... - He had it at the start, right? - Dude! - He literally had it... - Guys, guys! Did you see that last rally? That was crazy, huh? That was, like... That was sketch! Or as the Canadians would say, that was sketch, eh? What is he talking about? - Just be conscious of... - All right. Manhattan Maiden for you. Ooh! And the Garden Glory for you. Oh. - Enjoy! - Thank you. Am I supposed to drink it or water it? So how did you and Peter meet again? Is this the part where we don't talk about Peter? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. This is that part. Well, short story, we hooked up once, and then he bailed, and we became friends. And you married someone else. - Mm, Jimmy the mountain climber. - Mm. Which is funny, 'cause at the time, he felt like a safe choice for me. - Mm. - He was just very sure about me. Mmm. But, ultimately, he wanted to go on big adventures, and my adventures are reading books and being a mom. So, we realized he needed somebody who always wanted to be by his side and that just wasn't gonna be me. And your love life now? Sort of like… wind on an open prairie, or… footsteps in an empty attic, or what are those… Tumbleweeds going through an old ghost town. Sort of like that. Okay, we need to get on that. Well, good luck. It's been a minute. Oh, I know that guy. He's a professor at my school, the guy with the bow tie. - Wow, the guy he is sitting with is… - Oh, my God. I know. He is fuego. Oh, no, yes, that... And that's, uh, Theo Martin. He's the editor of Duncan Press. Mmm. They publish the best contemporary fiction on earth. Mmm, yeah. I only listen to celebrity bios. The Rob Lowe one is my favorite. The first one, of course. Theo Martin is so famous. Also, he's yummy, and he's sitting with someone you know. - He's very attractive, that's true. - So, come on. Wait, where you going? Oh, oh… okay. Maybe I should bring my plant. - It's true. You know, ambitious. - Hi! Sorry to barge over. But we saw you from over there... Hold on, you! You were in my class. - You came over and I saw… Yeah, hi. - Yeah! That was me. I never forget a denim skirt. Cute! That's a really cool story! I'm Minka. This is Debbie. You are? - Theo Martin from Duncan Press. - Yes. I recognized you. I've read every Duncan Press book. Wow. Well, not every book. I mean, no way. Yes, way! Okay, 870-page tome set on a pirate ship in the South Pacific? Hobart's Horizon. I read it in two days. Ahoy! All right, spy novel set in Crete. Oh, Ocean of Lies! I mean, one of the best! I kept saying for a week, "Eímai katáskopos!" Sorry? - That's, um, Greek for "I am a spy." - "I am a spy." - Sure. - All right, I got it, I got it. You did not read the Dust Bowl book, because no one read the Dust Bowl book. Where The Rattlesnake Sings. I... I bought it the day it came out. That was you? I'm pretty sure we only sold the one copy. That was me! I bought it! - Wow. - Anyway, yeah. S... So many vegetables. Oh, I know, isn't this crazy? I even said, "Oh, what? Should I get some dip with my crudité platter?" - It was so nice to meet you both! - Yeah, you too. Can I get your number, actually? I occasionally have galleys to give away, signed ones even. I would love that! Oh, my God. Here, put in your number. Ah. Okay. - Okay! Ciao, boys! - Ciao. - We're gonna go this way. - OMG, he is into you! - No, he's not. - Uh, okay. - He's being nice. - No, he's not. That is what "into you" looks like. Oh, please! It's cute how you like the book people, and how you and Peter actually read books. It's very cute. Yeah, we always had that in common. We were just two old-fashioned book lovers. Yeah, sure. And, well, there's the book he wrote. - What book? - Novel, big thing, massive. What? No. "What?" Yeah. I don't believe you. I'm telling you, he wrote a whole big fat book. Keeps it in an envelope in his oven. I found it once when I was trying to bake keto brownies, which, by the way, do not recommend. Two out of ten. There's zucchini in the recipe. Peter used to want to be a writer, but he quit when he moved here. He... He doesn't write anymore. Uh-huh. Except for the part where… he does. Open it. The Boy by P. Coleman. Peter! Wow. You're good at detective-y things. Hold on. Peter wrote a whole novel and never mentioned it to me? You should read it. I didn't read it because it's a book. Oh, no, I... I can't read it. If... If he wanted me to read it, he would have told me, because we tell each other everything. I mean, obviously, you don't. But we do. Okay. See, that's the thing. We tell each other… everything. Mmm. "Everything." All right, this is a minor setback, right? This happens all the time at the beginning of a project. What we need to do is pivot, okay? We're gonna stay with the same approach... I don't want to talk. Hey. I'm sorry. That sucked. My problem-solving skills are… I guess, more pertain to the business world. Thanks for the tickets. I enjoyed watching the game. Okay, you're being polite. This is bad. 'Night. Hey, hi. Hey! How are you doing? - I'm good. - Good, good. Wait, what's wrong? It's... You're... It's late where you are. Uh, no. You know what? It sounds echo-y there. - Are you in the bathtub? - No! I don't take baths. I don't even get baths. Right, right. You and I tell each other everything, right? - No. - What? I took Jack to the hockey game without asking you first, and he brought his friends Wade and Evan. You got Wade and Evan to hang out with Jack? Yes. I... Yeah, yes. And... And he ate pizza. It was gluten-free pizza, but pizza all the same. - Okay, Peter, I... - I... I'm not done. We're not gonna eat your casseroles, Debbie. Uh, ever. They're gross. Okay, thank you. That's a refreshing amount of honesty. I got it all out. That's it. Look, you don't have to report everything to me. I trust you. - You do? - Mostly. - And you trust me, right? - Of course. So, if you ever wanted to tell me about anything, you could, right? Tell you? About what? I mean, I don't know. - Like, if you have a special project. - You want to hear about my projects? My point is, you can tell me anything. Which is what I do, like, always. Same. I mean, total honesty. Always. Always. ♪ What I've been missing ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Like what I've been missing ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Something like what I've been missing ♪ There are six critical elements that we have to consider when deciding which risk model to use. Distribution of the wave functions… Wow. Wow. Now, are you sure Peter would want you to do this? I'm doing this for Peter! - Mmm. - Oh, here he comes. Here he comes. Oh, God, he is so happy to see you. It's so cute, it's gross! - Hi, Minka. - Hi! Hey. Thank you so much for coming. Sure, don't worry about it. I was... It was on my way, so… Oh, okay. Well, I wanted to give you this manuscript. - Ah. - And I wanted to get it to you ASAP. - Because I'm leaving town soon. - Wait, is this your book? - Did you write this? - Oh, no, no. I didn't... I didn't write it. Ah, right. See, the thing is that whenever someone just hands me a manuscript, it's about... I don't know, I'd say 100% of the time basically insane. Um, also not allowed to take submissions unless it's from an agent or an editor, so… Oh, well, this is perfect because she is the editor. She edited-ed it. Is that right? Yes. - Oh. - I'm a, um... I'm an edit-ed-or, but freelance. And I read so many manuscripts and this one is really special. It's called The Boy. And it's about a 13-year-old boy whose father dies of a stroke, and… …through a twist of fate, he becomes allergic to himself by… If he touches his skin, it blisters. I know, it sounds tragic. But it's magical and, uh… But… I get emotional about it, because, um… I have a 13-year-old son and he... - Oh, you do, really? - Yeah. So do I. Max. My son's Jack. Wow. That's… Yeah. I mean, I'm... I'm divorced now, but… So am I. Um… Mm-hmm. Well, I appreciate your passion, Debbie. Um, so I will do my best to read it as soon as possible. Also, if there's any way that you could read it sooner, I'm... I'm leaving this weekend. Oh, there's a clock? - No, I don't mean that... - No, it's fine. - It's fine. No, no, it's fine. - You're very special and important. I didn't mean it that way. But I promise it's worth your time. Okay, all right. I'm excited to check it out. Thank you. - You're very welcome. - You are… You know what you are. I… would like to think so, yeah. - All right. - Okay. All right. - Did I just give Theo that book? - You did! Now, when are you going to tell Peter? Peter, right. ♪ Oh, Heartbeat City, here we come… ♪ You know much about The Cars? You know, the band The Cars? - It's what you always play. - Yeah. You want to know why? For starters, they were my dad's favorite. So then my dad left. As I mentioned, and you already know, he kicked the bucket, right. So then, for a while, I didn't listen to The Cars at all. I couldn't. It was, like, too painful and just reminded me of shit... s... Stuff that I had lost. And one day, I heard 'em on the radio. And their songs were still with me, even if he wasn't. And they always will be! Look, you got great parents, and you live in a nice little house stuck in the middle of a mountain like a ski chalet. But I get it, you got your shit. Everybody does. Life is hard, right? You go... Sometimes, it kicks you in the teeth. Like, I do not have my shit together. I was gonna be a great American novelist and find somebody to spend my life with. And now I'm just a lonely guy with outstanding hair that tells other people who to be, even though I'm not sure I know who I am. You know? I got an idea. - Please no more branding. I'm begging you. - Nope. Screw that. We... Now, we are moving on to action. You… need to play hockey with the team. - The one that Evan and Wade are on. Yes. - What? Yes. If... If you want to, I support it. But not because you need to be friends with those asshole kids. And again, I'm sure they're great. You're gonna let me go out for the team and practice? Yes. Are you gonna tell Mom? So I'm thinking maybe we tell her when she gets back. Thanks. Yeah. Go learn something. - I will. - Mm-hmm. All right, see you later, Jumpin' Jack Flash. - No. - Nope? All right. How's it going? You look exhausted. Yeah, I screwed something up yesterday, and, uh, didn't sleep last night, but then I did... I did a good thing today. I think. Yeah, this whole "being a life-changing male adult role model…" little trickier than I anticipated. Hmm. I think you were just supposed to keep him alive. In order to pass this exam, one needs to be able to describe specific time series models. Including exponential smoothing… …autoregressive, and autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic models. - Would you mind taking that outside? - Yeah, pardon me. Thank you. Wait, I don't understand. What did the assistant say? Okay, she said to just come up and see Theo. And thank you for coming with me, I have no idea what to say to this guy. I mean, who can say things when he's smiling at you with that smile? Right? That smile. Okay, that's Duncan Press. - You got this! You got this! - Okay, very exciting. Oh, boy. Good morning. Oh, hi. Uh, I'm looking for Theo Martin. Mmm. Oh, sorry. - Cute. - Oh, my God. Look at those book covers. Oh, there you are. Welcome. Hello, Minka. Theo. - Debbie. - Hi! Sorry to have you run uptown without much notice, but this book, I mean, it is… It has a lot of promise. Oh, my God. Did you read the whole thing already? That's, like, a shit ton of pages! Well, my assistant did. She thought it had potential, and passed it on to me, and I gotta say, I... I agree. Wow. I also see why you cried. I may have shed a tear myself. The dad, right? Especially, yeah. I mean, look, I'm very interested. And I would... I would really like to speak to the author as soon as possible. The author. You know, can I, um… I had a really big coffee on the way here. I just need to tinkle. Sure, yeah. Most of the tinkling happens right down the hall. Okay. - This is insane! - I know, this place is so old school. I smell dead people. No, no, no! What am I doing? I'm acting crazy! I know I like to help friends out, but that normally means picking up Alicia's twins at carpool. I have to just call Peter, and put a hold on this. Ew, no. No? You believe in Peter's book, so why not see this through? So, just… Yeah! You got this, girl! Okay. Okay, okay. Also, no, I actually do have to pee. Theo, I would like to discuss the next steps. Sure. You free for dinner? Uh… Uh, yes. Yes! Sure. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect! - Uh, is that the coach? - Yeah, that's him. All right, you stay here. Let me do my thing. - Say hey to your coach. - Hey. - You got... One of these yours? Yeah? - Uh, yeah. - That's him. - Oh, Weasel F... Ev... Evan! - That's him, yeah. - Yeah, he's… Yup. That's it, J... You're good! Are you ready? Oh! That's it! Yep! Yep, that's my guy! That's him. - That's great. - That's my guy. I thought black was best, since you are a bright winter. Oh, I... I don't need a new outfit. Aww! I feel terrible. I'm about to tell a guy, who's the most famous literary editor in all of America, that I gave him a manuscript that he might want to publish, but he possibly cannot. And why isn't Peter calling me back? If you can't reach Peter before your date with Theo... No, no, no, it's not a date. - Let me have this! - Okay. I mean, I can't even stay out that late. I have an exam tomorrow. Shh. Try a dress on. I'm sorry, I'm just worried about Peter and Jack. - Where are they? - Try one on! Please. You are by far the fastest guy out there. New nickname, Jack Frost, 'cause you own the ice! - 'Sup, fellas! - What's up, man? - Great day? - Great day, brah. - Yes, I love that! - Great day. So, you ever gonna have kids? What? I don't know. Should I? I mean… you're not terrible at it. A little weird, but you don't suck. I don't? No. Well, I should probably start my homework. See ya. Oh! Hey-o. Oh, for me? Yeah. Come on, take a break. Well, I don't... I don't need a break. I don't work here, so… Yeah, I know. Oh. All right. - Oh, yeah. - All right. Yeah. Mmm. You know, I thought you didn't like me. Why? Because I've been such a jerk to you? Yeah, that. Ah, look, I'm sorry. I... I think I've just been stressed out being responsible for a human. You know, I've never even taken care of, like, a… herb plant before. Well, dude, herb plants can be as hard as children. Yeah, I got... I got a sage over by the patio, kept me up till 3:00 a.m. last week. I call it "plant colic." So, you know, I get it. Yeah, no, you get it. - Same damn thing. - Yup. Yeah, actually, I feel like I'm, uh, doing an okay job now. Ah, that's dope, brah. Hmm. And so I'm sorry if I wasn't as friendly as I could have been. Right? 'Cause I'm... Hey, I, actually... I think Debbie's really lucky to have you 'round here helping out. Oh, no, no, no. I'm the lucky one, okay? I mean, she is… …amazing, you know? Yeah. Yeah, she really is. I mean, we've been friends for a long time. I mean, not as long as she and I have been friends, so… - Oh, no. Well, of course, I'm not... - In years. Right. Look. You and Debbie, you have your thing, which is different from our thing. - Your thing. Yeah. - Right! Like, you're her friend. I'm her neighbor and, like, part-time lover, you know? - What was that? - Oh, you know what? You probably haven't noticed this because you guys are just friends, but… brodiddly, she is pretty hot. Yeah. I mean, I know, I know, she's out of my league. I got it. But I have a plan. Okay? My thing is… I just keep showing up in her life, you know? And then maybe, maybe, she'll change her mind about me. You know what I mean?

Who would've thunk you'd have the same number? - I didn't change it for this exact reason. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. - Oh. How long has it been? Twenty years. And yet I'm 30. Weird. Amazing.

You know, it's, um… It's kind of loud in here. It's actually really quiet. I was just thinking… You know, if you want, I live right near here. I mean, I... I wanted to. Then… I mean, look at me. I put on the suit, I went to the bar. I... I had a moment with a woman. Mm. And... And I was... I'm... I'm trying to be the guy, right? But that guy is… Where's that guy? I... I don't know, but he smells terrific. Thank you. - Sage-y. - With a touch of oak. - I didn't, uh, pick up on that. - Oh, it... it's there. Can I tell you something? It's a thing that I don't think I've ever said out loud. - Immediately. Please. - Okay. So, the night that Debbie and I… spent together, after, I told her to stay away from me, because… I... It's... And... And... And then I just... I found myself thinking about her. A lot. So I was gonna call her and see if she… Whoa. But a couple days later, I saw her and Jimmy at the BevCon movie theater. Oh, my God, the BevCon! I saw every movie there. I saw Hunt for Red October there like eight times. Yeah, anyway, the... So, when I saw them, it... I... I could tell. You... So I just... I let it go. And then she comes to pick me up from rehab, the second time. And I'd done, like, uh, therapy in there, right? And so when she comes to get me, I'm on this truth kick, and I'm gonna tell her how I feel about her. So... But she was still married. And... But they didn't have a kid yet. And he was away a lot. He was doing his climbing thing. - What was that? - It was cl... climbing. Like, his... Look, he would climb the mountains. Okay, well, it looks like fishing. Anyway, so I get in the car… and… she tells me she's pregnant. Wait, is that why you left LA? No! No, it was the quakes. That... I'm sc... I'm scared of them. Oh, right, the "scary quakes." You have to tell her. What? No, I c... No! What are you... I... It's too late! Dude, remember, I was at the first poker game. - Yeah. - You played like shit. But you took risks. What happened to that guy? That guy is… Drank too much, and he quit writing, and he's got a friend, and she lives across the country, and, most importantly, he's dated like a million women, and it never lasts more than six months. Why? Because he is an unknowable piece of shit. No, no, it's because he has been with the wrong people. - Stop telling yourself that story. - Mmm. Peter! Your whole life has been leading up to this point. Don't waste a second. Oh, my God. I've had ten of these. I'm out of my mind.

Well, listen, I know it's your last night, I don't want to monopolize you before you go home, but I've got something important I'd like to talk to you about. A proposal, kind of. - Uh, if you are free for a drink? - Oh, um, yeah, sure. Brownstone Club? Great! "Proposal"? Wow. Wow! Yeah. Well… What is it? What's wrong? Nothing, it's just… I haven't heard from Peter. Jack and I texted, but I haven't heard from Peter. Okay, I can't with this mood. Look at what you've done. In a measly few days, you got a boring as hell but useful, I guess, degree, got Peter's book published, and befriended an adorable millennial, me. And then Theo, the sexy cherry on top! I mean... No, no, you're right. You're right. It's just... It's just a little bit weird when I don't hear from him. Forget Peter! Theo, Theo, Theo! That's who you're seeing right now. Guess we don't have time to buy you a new dress. Oh, no, I'm just gonna go as Debbie tonight. Just regular Debbie. Aww. Speaking of which, I've been looking for my jean jacket. - Have you seen it? - I mean, hard to say. Can't really pick it out from all the other mass-market denim and chambray items strewn about. Also, you do know they make these things called spinners now? - There's something under here. - What is it? Drugs? Porn? What? Oh, my God. He wrote another book? Real scribbler, this guy. It's not a book. We should definitely not open that. No, yeah, here's the thing about me. I respect people's privacy. Same. As my drunk mother used to always say, "Mind your own business." Five-star parking. All right. Don't you want to… I mean, tryouts start in 15 minutes, so… Yeah. So, what happens next? Mm, like after practice? I don't know. We can get a slushie. I enjoy their slushies. Yeah, me too. Um, no, I mean, like, with you, and me, and Mom. Well, I go back to New York, and... Yeah. Uh, yeah, let... Let's say that didn't happen. I mean like, it just seems that we make a good team, the three of us. - Wow, yeah. - Here, in LA, in our house. I don't know how you guys decide this kind of stuff, but that was just a thought I had. I don't know how we decide this stuff either. What's that look for? You look like you just felt an earthquake or something. Well, I better get in there. Hockey tryouts. - See you in there. - Yeah. Hmm. Peter hates mementos. So many pictures of… you. And postcards I sent him? Oh, the Dodger game! Oh, I... I found that in Texas. Yeah. Wait. Oh, my God. He saved it too? Oh, my God. This makes so much sense. Why he couldn't fall in love with me. There had to be a reason. It couldn't be because of me. I'm the best. Do you love him too? I'm… I think I… I feel like… Okay. - I'll tell you what I think. - Okay. I think you fell in love with Peter that first night you hooked up. What? No. No, no, no. That would be reckless and impractical, and I am not... Human? We know. That's why you freaked out about his book and ran around like a little lunatic with it? No, I didn't! Oh, my God, I did. Oh, my God. Yes, I did. Because you're in love. You are. Don't make me sing "I Am A Woman In Love" by Barbra Streisand, 'cause I will. - I sang it at my nana's retirement home. - No, no, no, no, no. Even if I felt like Peter and I were… No, no, no. He... Peter's not interested in me like that. - Um... - He let me know that night. And... And over the years, just by dating women who are utterly nothing like me. I would just… No. And I would never risk my friendship with him on the off-chance... Don't you get it? All you have to do is take a chance. No, see, that's what you don't get about me, is I don't take chances. What I have is great, and... and... And I appreciate it, you know? You get what you get, and you don't get upset. And... And… that's how I live my life. And... And that is how I play poker. I never draw into a straight. You know what I mean? You don't, 'cause you don't play poker, but I'll explain it later, at a different time. But this is just… This is who I am. And... And... And I evaluate odds and it has kept me safe, and it has kept my kid safe, and I just... I just need to be safe. Yeah. No, no! No. No! No. No. Okay, I just don't understand why you're not taking into consideration how I feel about this. I have to... I have to go! I don't want to talk about this anymore. I have to take a shower, I'm gonna go see Theo. - And Peter? - Just forget about it. I don't want to roll the dice. If you start with another poker analogy, I will perish. You do take chances, by the way. I've seen it. You can do this. You can tell Peter how you feel. You can. Let's go, guys! Come on! Come on, kid. ♪ I don't care if you hurt me some more ♪ ♪ I don't care… ♪ Oh, gosh, okay! Hi! Hey! I'm so sorry I'm late. - Did you run here? - No, I'm just… I'm just a little bit breathless. - Well, me too. - Okay. Um… - Hi. - God, I... I wanted to wait till appetizers, but do you mind if I just start? Yeah, sure. ♪ You're all I've got tonight ♪ ♪ You're all I've got tonight… ♪ Get in there, get in there! Go, Jack! Um… My proposal for you is that I got you an interview at Macmillan. Full-time editor position. They need one, you're amazing, and they would be really lucky to have you. Wow. And the second part is... Is that I didn't get you an interview at... at Duncan Press. And that is because I feel like we should see what you and I have… are… uh, could be. It's early, of course, just you shouldn't work with me if we're even considering exploring that, you know? And I know you had a whole life in LA. You know, I don't want to get ahead of myself. He says, terribly ahead of himself. I… Wow. I... I... I don't know what to say. Yeah, it's... it's not a little bit, it's a lot. It's a lot. There we go, there we go. Let's go, guys! Keep at it! Let's go! Let's go. That's it! Yes. - Go! Go! - Let's get it! Go, go, go! Theo, you are wonderful. Um, just this past week has been… unreal. Uh, I really… The fact that you believe in me means the world to me. Um, but earlier today, I… I was looking for my jean jacket, and... and I was digging around, and then I found this envelope, and, you know… Oh, my God. This is the weirdest thing I've ever said. I… I think I might be in love with somebody else. - Right. - And I... I know that's a crazy, crazy thing to say. I mean, love's crazy. Love's the worst. It's a nightmare. Especially when it hits you, whoosh, just out of nowhere. Back up, back up, back up. Are you all right? Ow. Oh. - You need to get that? - Uh… I... I do. - Don't worry about it. - I'm, uh... I'll be right back. Hey! I know that, um, we're gonna see each other tomorrow, but I wanted to... Wait, what? Oh, my God. What do you... What do you mean, "hockey tryouts"? Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Ambulance got there so quick and he's with the doctor now, so… Oh, here comes the doctor. I'm gonna put you on speaker. Oh, my God, is he okay? Uh, well, good news, he's doing great. - There... There we go. - Ah! He does have a touch of a headache and some nausea. Okay. - So we're keeping him here overnight. - Oh, my God. Just to make sure he didn't sustain a concussion, improbably, or another kind of hematoma. Oh, my God! I want to talk to him. Uh, he's gonna be okay. I don't want to talk to you, Peter! I want to talk to Jack! Well, he's in his room. Put Jack on the phone, Peter, before the serious brain injury sets in and he doesn't remember who his mother is! - I'm gonna... I'm gonna go. - Yeah, you should, probably. Hematoma, that's, uh… That's what you want, right? - No, no, no. You don't want that. - Yeah, you don't? - That's... That's a bad thing. - You don't. Yeah, I got... He... Yeah, he's right here. It's your mom. - Hey. - Hey, honey, are you okay? I'm fantastic! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I'm not there. I... I... I'm coming home right now. I... Mom, stop! What? You're hurt, honey. This was the best week of my life. Me and Peter, like, we watched Alien, and drove in a convertible, and I almost drank coffee. W... Wait, just slow down. Ba... Back up, what? What? This week I got to be a different kind of me. It was kinda great. Don't be mad at Peter, okay? I... I... Jack, I will deal with Peter separately. And guess what? I made the hockey team! Okay, well, we're gonna have to discuss that when I get home. No! I want to talk about it now. I want to do it. I want you to let me. Look, I know you're afraid of stuff. Sometimes, I am too, but I don't want that for us anymore. - Oh, okay. Um... - Anyway, love you, Mom. - I gotta go, my friends are here. - Dude, you wiped out! - We were there! - It was epic! It was super sick. Like, I remember getting tied up and, like, hooked. - Like, this guy crashed into me and then… - See? That's... He's fine. Well, and the... And, look, I'm genuinely sorry that I didn't... Is Alicia there? Yeah, yeah. She's right here, and... and I'm gonna be here when you get back. Please don't be. I'm coming home right now. Please just go. - But... - Peter, just go! - Jack's had an emergency. He's hurt. - Is he okay? I don't know. I have to go. Theo, you're… You know what you are. You too. Oh! Sorry. I just landed in LA and I'm going straight to the hospital. - He's not there. - What? He's at home with Alicia and he's fine. But I tried to call you a million times. I'm sorry, okay? I screwed up. I should have told you before he tried out. You think? Look, I thought I was giving him what he needed! - What? A hematoma? - Hi, by the way. - What? - I'm over here. - What are you doing here? - I'm going. You told me to go. Well, good. I should have told you, but there's some shit that you should have told me too. Oh, no, no, you don't get to turn this around. - I talked to Minka. - Yeah? She told me about the book. What you did is insane! - Look, I was gonna tell you about the... - Oh, there's other stuff too. How about Zen? And what about Theo? As in, "Oh, Theo!" - Hold on. How do you know about that? - There's a camera in my apartment. You watched me and Theo? Only long enough to want to poke my eyes out! What happened to, "I'm done with all of that?" Well, I'm a person, Peter, I'm not a rock. That's literally what you said! "My heart is a cold, hard stone." Okay, okay, well... And you talking about somebody's personal life? Oh, okay. Here we go. I gave you my kid. He is my whole life! Which is maybe a problem. Wow. I cannot believe you. You know what? You always said you were a piece of shit. Well, maybe you were right! - That was really fucking mean. - Okay, well, you... What? I dropped my life to come help you? Is that what I did wrong? You're unbelievable! Unbelievable! Oh, shit! Wait! Wait, don't… Hold on a second. - I'm so mad at... - What the hell is wrong with you? - You went through my things? - Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you say anything? Why did you let so much time go by? - Be... Because I was scared! - Scared of what? - Scared that I'm not good enough for you! - Oh! Scared that you're gonna reject me if I tell you how I feel. Well, just tell me how you feel! You know how I feel! Wait, what? That, what, you're in love with me or something? No! Debbie, I am madly, deeply, overwhelmingly in love with you. And I have been since the moment I met you. Well, you could have said something. We talk every day. Well, now what are we gonna do? I thought we were gonna be friends forever. - We're not? - No. We're not gonna be friends anymore, Debbie. - So you're gonna be a published author! - That's... Yeah. And you're gonna be a fancy editor. - So weird. - Big time. - Can't wait to see Jack. - Oh, my God. He's gonna freak out. - He's gonna be so excited. - Wait a second. Are we gonna be hand-holders? - I've never seen you hold a human's hand. - I don't hold hands! Yeah! - But it... it feels kind of… good. - What about this one? - Yeah. I think we're hand-holders. - Mmm! - Oh! Look at us. - I think we are. Okay, there he is. That's our Uber. All right.
