Come on, Jian. You can do it. Do your trick. Make Papa proud, huh. Let's go. Come on. Ah. All right boys, which one's gonna win? - Again! - Okay, okay, ready? One. Two. Three. Ready, go! Find a good place? Okay, I'll go first. Under a bucket. - Red bucket? - Mhm. Good one, okay, you. Jian, do your trick. Which one's gonna win? Come on boys, which one? Come on Jian, it's a hard one but you can do it! Close your eyes. You cheated. It's in your pocket. Okay, fine good job. - Again. - Okay, okay, ready? Jian! - Wait, what's wrong? - He's coming. He's coming, he's angry. Daddy wants to be mean! Boys, where are yah? Boys! Come out here boys! This has got to be the most boring job in the world. No, listening to you complain is the most boring job in the world. Intruder, Research Laboratory. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? On your knees! Now! So I know this DJ. He's an asshole. Sir, sorry to interrupt. We had a break in, corporate headquarters. we chased him into the street, LAPD showed up and took him into custody. What exactly were they trying to break into? Looks like he was trying to break into the laboratory. Thank you. Give me a minute. So who is he? Police took him in but the arrest report is not online yet. - Did he get into the lab? - No. But security tells me he tried to use Boa's R-Fit card to get in and that's what set off the alarms. You should've told me that earlier. Jian Huang. I've been expecting you. Whiskey Tango, we are approaching the objective in one mike, be prepared for immediate engagement. All teams move out. What do we got, Jian? I thought there was something here but I cannot... - What the number? - Stand by. I'm picking up something. Second floor, corner apartment. Move in. Apartment 7, green door. - Clear! - Clear! Clear! There's nobody here. Under the bed. - Are they just... - Under the bed! - Let me see your hands! - Don't move! - Don't move! - Hands up! - We got him. - Target secured. - There's someone else. - What! Ah! You're awake. Couldn't sleep. I got a special thanks for my assent for your work last night. They've been searching for that apartment for two years. I've got some paperwork here I'd like you to review. Something happened. You tried to decide whether or not to tell me. I thought I should give it some time. Maybe there was more information. It's Bao, isn't it? They called me early this morning. He's dead, isn't he? I wanted to see if there was more information. I'm sorry, Jian. I'm sorry. Where? Los Angeles. They said suicide. It doesn't feel like that to me. I have to take a look for myself. I can't authorize that, we need to catch a plane to Prague. - You're in operation. - I'm not asking for permission, Frank. It's my brother. Of course. I'll see what I can do. Just get me the clearance. I can handle myself. Just be careful. I don't think it's a good idea. You're waiting for me? Sorry? Oh, um. Hi, Detective Laurner. How'd you know it was me? You look like a cop. Hey, Mister... Mister Wang. - Huang. - Huang. I'm sorry that we're late. I was told to meet you at the gate. I'm Detective Stevens. Shall we? First time in LA? - Mhm. - We're sorry for your circumstances. If there's anything we can do to make this a little easier don't hesitate to ask. If you need to, uh, see your brother's body we can make that happen if you want. Must have some pretty powerful friends? Sorry? Well, this isn't exactly what we do. We're working on a kidnapping case. Not your brother's death but we've been given orders to take you to the crime scene and provide whatever evidence that you need. Jian, I'm sorry. It's just more than a little unusual. What do you do back there in Hong Kong? You a cop? - I think you passed it. - What? I thought you said that this was your first time in LA. How'd you know I passed it? I knew the address. The cleaning lady found him here. The medical examiner estimated that he'd been diseased for a couple hours. We're still waiting for a full toxicology report. There was an empty bottle of pills on the floor by his feet. Has your brother had any history of medical problems? It wasn't from the prescription. There was enough of that stuff to shutdown anybody's system. It's not the pills. You know, we don't know much about your brother other than he's been living here under an expired visa since three years ago. No employment records, not even a bank account. Do you know how your brother made his living? 'Cause these places don't come cheap. Sorry, I can't tell you that. And why is that? Because we haven't spoken in years. May I ask how you make your living? This isn't about me. He didn't die here. I beg your pardon. He was moved here. After he was killed. And why would you say that? He didn't kill himself. How would you know that, you just said you hadn't spoken - to your brother in years. - You know what, it really doesn't matter because we're doing our own thorough investigation and we'll know exactly what happened to your brother. Sounds great. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get some rest after that long flight. You're planning on staying? We were told to take you to a hotel. Why would I stay in a hotel. This rent is paid, isn't it? Well, if you finally think of something why don't you give us a call. Abby, Abby don't! - Don't, don't what? - Don't... don't make this into something that it's not. All right, it's a case of suicide. - Plain and simple. - Well, he seems pretty sure and I don't know where he's getting his information but there's something he's not telling us. His brother is dead, the family's a little weird. Weird, he goes in the apartment, scans the place and suddenly it's murder, what the hell was that? We've got other, more important cases do we got. Something's not right and you know it. - You cheated! - How? It's in your pocket! Okay, fine good job. Jian, help me. Ah! On your knees! Hello? Arrested? Okay. I'll come pick him up. Thank you. I didn't do it. What's my son gonna think? Yeah, none of us did. He's gonna think what I thought about my dad. What were you arrested for? They said I robbed a jewelry store. They said they got the whole thing on surveillance footage. Tell your lawyer the surveillance footage was modified by the manager, he used someone that looked like you and changed the timecode so it matched the date you were there shopping for your wife's anniversary present. It was an inside job. Hey, you got a good story for me? Jian Huang. Mr. Huang, how nice of you to call me. Getting into a lot of trouble for someone so new to our city. Guess you weren't in need of a rest after all. If it were up to me you'd be back on a plane to wherever the hell you came from. What? Vortex is not what it seems. It's not just a software company. Vortex has been a major player here in the software industry for several years now. Someone at Vortex killed my brother. How do you know that? I just know. Vortex has a lot of security. There's an entire locked down part of the building. A secure part of a software company and that is significant how? They're just protecting their secrets like any other corporation. Secrets. Sure. It's not just a software company. Where the hell are you going now? What the... I told you, dude, end of the line. You gotta go to the end of the line, dude. The end of the line. What are you doing? I need to talk to someone in there? - Who? - He has something to do with my brother's murder. Alleged murder. - Murder. - How can you be so sure? What is it you're not telling me? I'm going in there to talk to him you either can help me or get me back out of jail again. Told you, end of the line just like everybody else. LAPD. That's him. Who? Mason Roth. He works for Vortex. He knew my brother. What did you do to my brother? - What? - What did you do to him? I don't know what you're talking about. Jian help me. Ah! I shouldn't have gotten you involved, I'm sorry. Expelled from MIT. That's weird. And then nothing for several years until 2005. Started Vortex. Let's go. Come on. All right boys, which one's gonna win? Which one? Jian. Do your trick. Make Papa proud, huh. That one. You sure? Yes, he's gonna break that one's jaw. The fight won't last long. Hey! One thousand. Fifteen-hundred. Yeah! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Come on! Come on, hitting the wrong guy, huh. You gotta fight! Hey, what are you doing? No! What are you doing! Why'd you tell him the wrong one? He's gonna find out and he's gonna beat us. To hell with him. Let's get the hell out of here. Let him win his own fights. No! Jian! I'm gonna kill your brother! You filthy little liar! Hello? It's me, Frank. I expect you're gonna be on your way back here by now. Why didn't you call? Frank, I'm sure he didn't kill himself. I can't go back. I can't go back until I found out who it is. I did some digging and I think Vortex is behind this. Vortex, that's Roth's company. I need your help, Frank. I can't do this alone. I'll be on the next plane there. But do me a favor, will yah? Keep your head low. I don't want to lose you too. Bao. Ugh! Ugh! Meet me at the control center. Yeah, now. Uh... give me another five minutes, will you? - So what time was he there? - About ten o'clock. He had a plain clothes cop with him. Seemed like a detective. Well, where are they now? Jian went to Bao's apartment. We lost the detective. Jian knows we'll be watching the apartment. You know what, don't do anything. Let him come to us. But you call me as soon as he leaves, all right? Yes, sir. - Can I help you? - FBI. I'm here to see Captain Duke. So... solved the case already, huh? No, sir not yet. It's already been three days. And now you want Abby back on the case. Actually no, we don't. And your rising young star is about her find herself in a whole lot of trouble. Oh really? How so? I guess she didn't tell you about last night? No, she hasn't. A tourist, Jian Huang broke into the Vortex Software Corporation Headquarters. Of course I knew about that. The state department wanted him released and Vortex didn't object so I sent Abby to pick him up. And then Mr. Huang and Abby went to a nightclub where they assaulted the owner. Beat the crap out of the bouncers. The owner of that club was a man named Mason. He's a right-hand-man of Wallace who's the owner of Vortex. All right, I'll get her side of it. That's just not gonna be good enough, Captain. We need you to suspend her until we tell you otherwise. Listen guys. I know you've probably been spanked already for taking her off the kidnapping case and not being able to solve it but I'm not gonna suspend her. You need to listen to me, Captain, 'cause I'm about to tell you something that cannot leave this office. - Is that understood? - All right. But it better be damn good. The president of Vortex, Wallace, was a golden child at MIT. He entered the graduate program at the age of 15. He was considered one of their top engineering students but he matured into a megalomaniac. Eventually, he was expelled. After that, he disappeared into Asia for many years. Showed up back in the United States about a decade later. Shortly after, he started this software company, Vortex Software here in Los Angeles. And we believe that this company is a veneer over a huge international criminal enterprise. He's extremely dangerous, Captain. You need to get Abby off this case now. Before she gets drawn into something that she cannot handle. Okay. I'll take care of it. Very good. Thank you, let's go. Abby. My office now. - Captain, I... - Don't say a word. Now you've gone too far this time. You're suspended until further notice. - Well, I don't understand... - Buh-buh, listen. If you pursue the Vortex or the kidnapping case in anyway whatsoever you will go before the disciplinary board. Gun and shield. - Captain... - Not a word! Go. - Yeah? - Sir, the detective has entered Bao's apartment building. How should we proceed? All right, get some more guys up there. Just make sure that they understand that I need Jian alive. All right, I need to see inside the apartment. Get a drone over there but don't let him see it, all right. I knew it, I knew there was something wrong with you from the beginning and I know there's a lot more going on with your brother and Vortex than what you've told me. I can't tell you anymore. There's nothing you can do now anyways. Just call it a suicide and go back to your regular cases. I would if I could but I can't! Because I've been suspended! I warned you. I tried to keep you out of this. You should go now before get into more trouble. How could I possibly get into anymore trouble? Do you know how hard I've worked to become a detective? Now I'm not going anywhere until I get my badge back and I can't get my badge back until Bao's murder is solved. So you know it's not a suicide now? No, I checked the toxicology report this morning. There wasn't enough medication to shutdown his system. So now I need you to tell me everything you know about Wallace, your brother and Vortex now. All right. Let's talk. I'm going to tell you something. You're not going to believe me at first. But what I'm about to tell you is true. What? My brother and I were born with the ability to see things. Like clairvoyants? Something like that, yes. Give me your hand. You took Victoria's doll from the crime scene? How could you possibly know that? When we touch someone or something or sometimes even if we get close enough we have visions. Who are you really? My brother and were recruited to the ISN to track down persons of interest but my brother couldn't tolerate the structure within ISN. How does Wallace fit into all this? Wallace once worked for the ISN. It was him who convinced Bao to leave. One day they just... disappeared. Spread out, and search the basement. Hey, hey, hey, he's over here! The target escaped using the north exit. I need to call Frank, he was supposed to meet me at the apartment 'bout now. No signal, need to get closer to outside to make a call. Wait here. Wait, you can't leave me alone right now! Something's wrong. Get up, get up, get up, I'll do it myself. Okay. Got you. Son of a bitch. Okay. Okay, where the hell are you? All right, get the drone outta there, but keep it nearby. Okay, sir, but the battery's almost dead. Then fly another one over there. You understand me? All right, they're in a warehouse somewhere near Boyle Heights, 6th Street Bridge. I'm gonna text you the address right now. Get over there as quick as you can. You get him back alive. As far as the cop goes, do whatever you gotta do. While you were out, I thought of a way we can get into Vortex. Let's go. Hey! You gotta jump! Let's go, let's go! Frank, so nice to see you again. I can't honestly say the same. Last time I saw you was a photo on the front page of People's Daily. You were on your way to prison for corruption. I would have preferred that was my last memory of you. Stick him in the laboratory. I'm hungry. Don't worry, I'll figure something out. Hi, I'm Val, nice to meet you. Have a nice day. My brother and I were just looking for - something to eat! - I said have a nice day. Fine, your phone number is 139-1016-7789, right? I think I got just enough money to make a call to your wife, Mai Hoi, and let her know about your mistress Sonny. Of course, if you give us some money for lunch, I might just forget about the phone call. We're just hungry. Jian, are you all right? I keep forgetting how hard this must be for you. Even if you two weren't close, he was still your brother. We were close. We just chose different paths, that's all. I'm sorry. Anyway, we should probably call Carl. I think he's the only one who can help us now. Hello? Carl, it's Abby. We need help. Abigail? How have you been? He can't help us. He's never called me Abigail before. Abby. That wasn't long enough, I couldn't get a location. Carl. - Was that her? - Yeah. She said she's in trouble. Now, I don't know what, Chief, but I tell ya somethin' doesn't smell right here. This Wallace, he's supposed to be some serious criminal? Then how come they're not chasin' him, instead of trying to find Abby? I know, I know. Looks like they're tryin' to use our girl as bait. - Bait? - Look, look, I know you're concerned about Abby, but she can take care of herself. I need you on this case. The mayor's all over my ass about it. Give me a progress report, will you? And, make it soon. Sir, we just lost Jian and the detective. So this is my baby, Frank, designed by me and a team of engineers. You know what this is, Frank? You have any idea what it does? If not, it's okay, I wouldn't really expect you to know. It's a lot of expensive shit! You're right. You're right, Frank, you're right it's very expensive, it is. It's a lot of fun to play with as well. Crane your neck, see if you can see this screen right here. Can you see that? You know what you're lookin' at right there? That there's an image of your brain activity, Frank. As a matter of fact, that's what it looks like when you're trying to come up with a plan. Relax, Frank. You're not goin' anywhere. You're insane, Wallace! And right there, you see that image? See that's your brain on emotion. See, with this instrument, I can pretty much read your mind. But more importantly, Frank, is I can record it. Start the injection. No, back off! Just a tiny prick, Frank. It's a tiny prick, Frank. It's not that painful. What you got goin' into your neck right there, that's a neurotransmitter enhancer. The effect of that drug when combined with my use of this tool, well let me tell you what it does. That signature right there, what I can do is I can amplify that a little more than ten times, then reverse engineer it, and put it right back in ya, Frank. You know what that allows me to do to you? Lets me control you, buddy. Ah! Sorry, I have a flat tire. Two flats in one day. - Uh, yeah. - Can I help? Yeah, I think this one's gonna be okay, but, um, could you help with the car? - I can take a look. - Yeah, it hurts pretty bad, so I'm just gonna stay here. There's a spare in the trunk, I think. He's in the basement, we need to shut down the security cameras. The camera recorders are in the cable room. Left at the first hallway, second door on the right. Not if you're gonna do exactly as we say. Okay, which one of these is the surveillance camera router? The three on the left. These ones? What do you mean crashed? Well, send a technician down there now! What was that about? Problem with the security camera system. Perfect. Perfect? She's gonna come here and try and rescue Frank. Put the building on lockdown. Yes, sir. I need the building on lockdown now. We have two intruders in the building, one male, one female. I need them taken alive. So, Frank, Jian will be here soon. Hey! That was fast. Yeah, I was, uh, just passin' by. Is there some kind of trouble? Our camera system's down. I guess it set off the alarm somehow. - Computers. - Yeah. They're more trouble than they're worth these days. Say, uh, look, I was, uh, lookin' for a place to relieve myself. - Too much coffee. - I'm really not supposed to let any non-employees through. Oh. That's fine, that's fine. - Thank you, buddy. - Uh-huh. Hey, it's a trap, get out! Jian! Help me! I saw this. It's where you killed my brother. That was an accident. Strapping him to this machine was no accident. Of course it was. But there's some information that I need, and fortunately for me, you can give it to me. Sadun Al-Biati, chief financial officer for OPEC. There's a number in his head, and I'd like you to give it to me. But you don't say anything, do you? Neither could Bao, 'till I built this. But what this little toy allows me to do is exponentially increase your clairvoyance level. Number? A number, that's what this is all about? A number? Yeah, just a number, but a number that unlocks OPEC's banking system, a series of numbers that will allow me to empty out several sheikh's bank accounts in microseconds. I didn't get anything from that photo, and even if I did, I'll never tell you. You will, you will. Or Frank here's gonna have a very unpleasant experience. - You're nuts. - Followed very closely by Abby's very unpleasant experience. Ah, God! Ah, ah! Damn you, Wallace! Hear that snap, Jian? That's a metacarpal being broken. What my colleague here did is he took his finger and pressed it the wrong way all the way to his wrist, a hyperextension. It's very painful. See, see, you'll give me anything that I want. Let's power it up. Chief financial officer for OPEC. Daddy was being mean. We're hungry. Backup needed, Vortex corporate headquarters. Kill her. What'd you see? Cops coming for you. - Really? - Sir, he's right. Cops are in the building. - Put a chopper on the roof now. - Copy that. Get the chopper to the roof now. Back! Back your ass. Okay. I have the detective, I'll meet you on the roof. Go get 'em! Go get Wallace! I'll take care of you. Clear the helipad. We are two minutes from landing. Come on, Jian! You can do it. Ah! Hey, come here, but give me the cuffs, give me the cuffs! Cuff them! All right, come here, tough guy. Ah, come on, on your feet. Thank you, detective, we'll take him from here. We can hold him on kidnapping charges while we look into the rest of his business. Yeah, why don't you just take all the credit, huh? Sorry to hear you feel that way. You did a wonderful job, you should be proud of yourself. Carl, can I get back on the Victoria case now? Jian, can we? We can find the girl. You know what, I'll tell the captain that you need a few more days. And you go find that girl, and why don't you take Jian with you? Like I said, you two make an excellent pair. Thank you. Hold, don't move! Victoria? Victoria, it's okay. It's okay, you're safe. You're safe. You're safe! You're safe, I got you! Come on, come on, let's get outta here. Hi, sweetheart. Victoria, this is Brooke, she'll take care of you. I promise. Come on. I'll take it from here. Congratulations, detective. Field office just contacted me just now. DC would like you to join the agency. Can you come in tomorrow morning, 9:00? Thank you, but, um, I can't, I have other plans. Well, the agency's offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Thank you so much, but you can tell the agency I won't be coming in. All right. Your choice. Great job today. Thank you. I would have liked to have met him. He would have liked you. It's in your pocket. Good job. We got a plane to catch.
