So nice of you to let me drop you at your hotel, Mr Darricott. Of course it's wretched for that exhibit to be held so near the The Metropole. Or we could have had a longer talk. I am told that mountains can be moved by faith. But I'm afraid that nothing can be done about moving The Metropole. However, I console myself. We meet again in two hours. I am so glad you were able to arrange your engagements so you could come. We dine early: 7:30. After all, we must hear something of the opera. Ah, yes. It might be interesting sometime to find out if Tosca really had a first act. Good afternoon, Mr Darricott. - Charles. Until tonight? - Until tonight. "Calling Mr Mellner. 714." "Mr Mellner." Here you are, Mr Darricott. Thank you, Mr Darricott. Here you are, Mr Darricott. What a marvelous day, Mr Darricott. You wouldn't think a fellow could run up a bill of $28 on 3-cent newspapers. Would you? Why not? He ran up $40 on me on 20-cent cigarettes. You ain't worried, are you? No. There's no chance in the world of that fellow not coming through. You said it. They don't make them any nicer than him. A real swell, is what I mean. Thank you, Fred. - Always a pleasure, Mr Darricott. Eugene. How do I stand today? Sorry, Mr Darricott. You just dropped three million. Three million, huh? - Three million. I'm afraid I haven't the cash on hand to reimburse you. Shall we call it square if I let you read the sporting page first? Anything you say, Mr Darricott. I took the other dress shirt to the laundry. Thanks, Eugene. Nice of you to go to so much trouble for me. I'd rather do a little valet service for you for nothing. Nothing? Than for some of those guys who give me 20-dollar tips. It's not everyone who can have an address like the Hotel Metropole. And valet service for ten dollars a week. We know a gentleman when we see one, Mr Darricott. Stop Eugene. You turn my head. Shall I lay out the evening clothes for you, sir? Yes. In the meantime, I'll draw my bath. That is, unless someone is using it at the moment. So nice of you to dine with us, Mr Darricott. I know how rushed you must be. - Rushed? I should think an attractive bachelor in New York would be stampeded. How does one avoid being trampled in the jam, Mr Darricott? I am afraid I cannot give expert testimony. I'm just an innocent bystander. Innocent bystander? Isn't that the fellow who always gets shot by accident? Why, Peyton. Don't you ever got shot by accident, Mr Darricott? It is so unromantic. Perhaps you could suggest a romantic way for Mr Darricott to get shot? Well. In a pinch I might shoot him myself. It would be a pleasure to be a target for you. I'd tremble. So I'd probably miss you. Well. If you are not going to shoot Mr Darricott at this very moment... It might be fun to see if we can get to the Robinsons on time just this once. You'd better hurry too, mother. You're more than fashionably late right now. If we could ever get your father to stop imitating a caged lion, we can leave. Horace. - Yes, dear? Mr Helden and Mr Dorset are here, sir. Oh yes. I am sorry, dear. I had hoped these fellows wouldn't turn up. Tony, it looks as if you and I must tear ourselves away from this nice gathering. They're here about the Austrian loan. Horace. - Yes, dear? I suppose this means you're not going to the opera with me again. Is that it? Afraid so. The second time this week you disappoint me. When I had my heart set on the opera. Horace. - I am sorry. What good does it do me for you to be sorry? Night after night if I want to go anyplace I have to go without you. It's humiliating. - Look here, my dear. It's not as if I didn't want to go. - I do not believe you. Well. If we could perhaps discuss this at another time. But it's always some other time. I'm sick of it. I want to go to the opera and I want to go with my husband. You've no right... - Mother. And you. Why must you go to those stupid business meetings with your father? If Tony has to go into my bank... I don't quite see how he will get along if he doesn't know something of my work. Now, goodnight. Run along, son. - Goodnight. Goodnight. There's one thing you must admit about our family, Mr Darricott. Never a dull moment. Well, if you will excuse me. Oh, Mr Darricott. You won't disappoint me, will you? I've had my heart set on tonight's performance. You will like it, you know. - I shall be delighted. If Peyton and I didn't have this engagement we simply must keep... I wouldn't think of making you change your plans, darling. We have to get to the Robinsons. - Alright. Alright. Have a good time, Mr Darricott. Goodnight, mother. Goodnight. It seemed as if you weren't going to have any choice. Any choice? Well, the way things have turned out. I am afraid you are going to have me on your hands. For tonight. At least. I shall be very happy. I'll get my wrap. Lovely, isn't it? Ah yes. One of my favorite subjects. Potemkin? Catherine and Potemkin. Oh. A lucky chap. That he found his Catherine. Almost too late. It would have been rather tragic for her too, wouldn't it? If she had not found him. I wonder. She made him a great man, didn't she? He made her a happy woman. And what better can any man ask for? If he finds his Catherine. But a woman can... But Catherine did find her Potemkin. But he had to die. Does Potemkin always have to die? What a dreadful fate. What a glorious death. Shall we go? To the... Opera? To the opera. You are not very complimentary, Mr Darricott. I am with you and yet it seems as though you are alone. I am always alone. If you could only know what an evening like this can mean to a man like me. A home. A fireside. A charming woman. What good are all those things... Where there is no love? But where there is love... I want so badly to talk to you Jamie. Almost too late for the opera. It is too late. It all seems so unimportant. The opera. Tosca. All those people. If only we could sit and talk. Perhaps if we could go to your... Well. Perhaps at The Metropole...? Well, if I... If I had only known. But... Unfortunately, my... My rooms are not my own for this evening. An old friend. I know a place where we can be alone. And that's why I am so unhappy, Jamie. I am so sorry. If I could believe you really meant that. Please believe it. Please mean it. I mean it. Then I believe it. How lucky I am. Lucky? Lucky to have met you. I have a husband whose life is not my life. I have children whose lives are their own. They don't need me. I need... Someone. I had nothing at all until... Until? Until I met you. And now... Five thousand, Mr Darricott? Six. - That's a lot of money. It's a lot of bracelet. Okay, Mr Darricott. I will mail you the check as usual. Thank you. Good day. - Good day, sir. Thank you. Let's take a look at those bracelets, Fred. Alright. But you don't have to worry about them. He didn't have to steal them. That dame is only too glad to give them to him. What dame? Say, I had this out with headquarters six months ago. The first time he brought anything in. Mr Horace Fendley might not know that these things are missing. But Mrs Fendley does. You'll never get a report on them as stolen property. Okay. Gadgets like these convert into cash with much less trouble that a check. You have to sign your name on the back of a check, you know. I'm sorry, Mr Darricott. Mrs Fendley left her home an hour ago. Her maid said there was no message. Thank you. - Yes, sir. And a demitasse? Well, I think we'd better wait, Victor. Hello Jamie. Well. Hello. Surprised to see me? Yes. And no. There's a simple explanation if you care to hear it. Auntie Mabel decided an hour ago to enjoy very, very bad health. So mother had to drive out to Long Island to see her. She asked me to phone you and say she couldn't keep her engagement with you. But somehow I forgot. But you remembered to keep her engagement for her? As a matter of fact mother thought it would be a good idea. That is. I'm sure she would have thought it a good idea if she had thought of it. Funny. I was about to suggest it myself. You liar. What you really mean is you're afraid you have a wasted evening on your hands. An evening can never be called wasted until it's over. I went to a lot of pains to dress the part, Jamie. You won't have to be very ashamed of me. 'Banker's daughter takes world altitude record reaching for compliments'. Banker's daughter has just that intention. I'm ashamed of you, my dear Rachel. You are positively... Beautiful? Beautiful of course. But the word I mean should also convey... Brilliance? Radiance? I am sure you know the word I mean. You're just too modest to use it. When you call me modest. Smile. To call you modest, my dear, takes more than a smile. Have it your way. Well. Do we dine or do we dine? We dine. We'll be two for dinner after all. Yes, sir. I have the table ready, sir. Thank you. Forgive me if I seem too bold. But dinner and the theater will be just the hors d'oeuvres of the evening? And if I might make one more suggestion. Don't you think it's a good idea if we kept the rest of the menu to ourselves? You mean... Not to tell... - Bright child. And now, Mr Jamie Darricott. Suppose I tell you I've looked forward to substituting for mother for months? And suppose I tell you... - What? That you are a funny kid. You'll change your mind about that too. There you are, Charles. - Thank you, Mr Darricott. Mr Darricott. Your cigarettes got in today from Cairo, sir. Oh? Send them up Charlie, will you? - Yes, I will. Thank you, sir. Good morning, Mr Darricott. Good afternoon, sir. Eugene. Miss Rachel has been waiting for you, sir. She is in the living room. Thank you. Hello. - Well. Hello. Well, aren't you glad to see me? Always. For the twentieth time... I take the liberty of reminding you that it's very unwise of you to come here. Meaning for the twentieth time that mother won't like it if she found out? You have an uncanny ability to divine just what I mean. As a matter of fact Mr Darricott, I came to deliver a message, as you asked me. Particularly if mother asks you. My party is not until ten. But mother and I thought it would be very sweet if you could come at nine. And help us with whatever pops up at the last minute. I shall be delighted. - Thank you. But that's not what you came here to tell me. I did have something else I wanted to talk to you about. Ah. Mother. You and she are being talked about. Everyone knows but dad. You've become a town scandal. It's an idle world, Rachel. Hundreds of people with nothing to occupy their time except... That still isn't what you came here to tell me. What is it? It's you, Jamie. It is you and I. It's been nearly four months since we began seeing a lot of each other. I know. I cannot keep on any longer this way. It's not easy for me, Rachel. - We've got to stop being furtive. A strange girl. - In what way am I strange? Is it strange to fall in love? To want what you love? My dear. I couldn't let you in for... This. - There's no need for this. We could get married, you and I. Why not? I have my own money. I will come into almost three million on my next birthday. Oh. I didn't mean to talk about that. - That's alright. You are privileged to talk about money to me. Jamie. Why shouldn't we announce our engagement tonight? That's impossible. - Why? I see. Jamie, you've got to break with this. Hmm. That is not so simple. If you loved me as I love you. You would find it very simple. How do you suppose I feel when I see you with mother? How do you suppose I'll feel tonight at my own party? What do you think it will mean to me... When I see you lead the Grand March with her on Friday night? Catherine. And her Potemkin. Rachel. You must be patient. Please. Kiss me, Jamie. You must go now. I suppose I have got to start learning to obey you sometime. Goodbye. Goodbye. Pardon me, sir. It is 12 o'clock. It's what? It's 12 o'clock, sir. Miss Fendley's party. Oh yes. I can't imagine what happened to him. What could happen to Jamie Darricott? If you knew the number of women who try to trap him into going to their parties. If you had any idea... - It's such a lovely party. What difference does it make if he comes or not? A lot of difference. It's my party and he might have had the common courtesy to be here. Oh, Rachel dear. What difference does it make? Whether he's courteous to you or not? It's time you left Jamie Darricott alone, mother. If he's interested in any one Fendley... - Rachel. It's the truth. You've fooled yourself long enough. You don't really think Jamie Darricott is coming here to see you? Elaine, dear. It was so lovely. Therese, you're not going? - Yes. We really must, Mrs Fendley. I hate to, but I'm leaving for home tomorrow and... When I was your age I never thought of going to bed... Until the others thought of getting up. - I have so much to do tomorrow morning. Now that you've met us you must come and see us often. Thank you. Say goodnight to Mr Fendley for me. - Yes. Indeed I will. Gaston. You had better wait. I shan't be long. How do you do, Mrs Blanton. Aunt Theresa. Who is that man? Are you trying to be funny, Norma? No. Who is he? That is Jamie Darricott. This year's ladies' man. Ladies' man? - Ladies' man. And at the moment 'the ladies' happen to be Mrs Fendley. Goodnight, dear. - Goodnight. Yes, Anthony? Mr James Darricott has just come in. Jamie? Why, I must... - One moment, mother. If he's to join this party I'm leaving. You are being a silly boy, Anthony. I am not silly. He is cheap and disgusting. Don't talk like that about a friend. He's not a friend. Do you know what they say? Anthony. I must forbid you to speak that way to me. As you wish. But if he stays, I go. You are always to do whatever suits you, Anthony. Goodnight, mother. - Goodnight, dear. Jamie. Jamie. Where have you been? Where have I not been? I asked you to be here at nine. You did, my dear. Do you I'll put up with your insults much longer? How do you do. Would I be insulting you if I asked you to be good enough to lower your voice? You are doing it perfectly. You are trying to humiliate me. Who is she? Thank you, no. Well. Our d?butante child. My felicitations. Thank you. Aren't you just a bit late? Oh... a bit. I've been waiting for you since nine. If you think I am going to forgive you, you're badly mistaken. You'll forgive me. I am afraid I shall. That's what makes me more furious than anything else. Well. Now for our charming host. No. You can stay and talk to me for a moment. Jamie. - My dear Elaine. If you must know, I am sorry I was late. And you know I didn't mean anything I said. I suppose you didn't. But sometimes. Sometimes... What, Jamie? Nothing. Nothing at all. How are you? Thank you. Well, how do you do? We have met before. Have we? Oh yes. Last night as you were leaving the Fendleys with Mrs Blanton. Remember? I see. Yes. I suppose to a 'ladies' man' that does constitute an introduction. Then you do know me. You. You don't live here in New York, huh? What makes you think so? I think I should have known. Remaining here for some time? I am leaving tonight. For my home. Why? Surely you don't want to leave New York? I've got to. Got to? That is slave talk. You ought to be doing what you want to. While you can want to. I generally do. I'm the little man who can show you all this big city. Do you know... That's one of the few things that I can take your word for. But I am taking the train. Do you know they tell me... That they have a train nearly every day now. I could show you a lot of this town in 24 hours. Somehow. I think your New York and my New York are different. Suppose we find out? Let's make the grand tour. See the clock around. See New York in all its different lights and shades. High life. Low life. Uptown and downtown. Starting say, with... Dinner at the St Regis. Or The Embassy maybe. Dance a little. Drop in a little musical piece. Catch a night at the opera. And then a midnight flight above the city. We can turn the plane over and over. The town would go round like a wheel with you sitting on the hub. You'll never know New York until you see it as the moon sees it. Then a nightclub or two. And out in time to catch the sunrise. Somewhere along the Hudson. The sun does some of its very nicest rising around here. Then we could separate long enough for a bath and a change of clothes. You think you can live without me that long? After 12 hours of Jamie Darricott. I doubt if I would be able to breathe any other air. And after breakfast we'll keep on going and going. And at 7:30. I deposit you at your train. I doubt if we would be able to stand more than a 24-hour stretch. Perhaps you could stand it for 24 hours. You are strong. But I'm just a weak, defenseless little woman. Ah. But you could trust me. Perhaps it's me I am afraid of. You know. There is only one slight catch. I'm meeting my aunt here and she stays with me until I take the train at 7:30. Ah, then it's a bargain. You get rid of your aunt. Telegraph your people you've been unavoidably detained for 24 hours. And at 7:30 I will call for you. Where? At the Transylvania Station. I don't know which track. I will take you to the train myself tomorrow night. When I return to New York. That is the time for the Darricott round-the-town tour. You may never get back and I may be dead. You? You'll live for ever. I doubt it. Dying is getting to be quite a habit around here. And it's a terrible thing to die without seeing New York. And Jamie Darricott. You will come back? Certainly not. For one thing. My trunks are packed. That's easy. Unpack them. I can't. They are shipped. Easier still. But a dress. As a matter of fact, you should have a new gown when you go out with me. You are impossible. Perhaps that's what makes me... Possible? Your aunt is approaching. You'd better not tell her of our plans. She'll want to come along. What is the name of your hotel? - The Holland Plaza. And your name? Norma Page. I will be there at 7:30. How do you do, Mrs Blanton. - How do you do, Mr Darricott. Hello, aunt Theresa. I was waiting for you and Mr Darricott came along. That's the best thing Mr Darricott has done. Women are always waiting for someone. And Mr Darricott comes along. - Unfortunately, not always. I am horribly late, Norma. I suppose I dare not allow myself to believe that... Fate arranged your lateness for my special benefit? I am afraid not. It was the hairdresser. Come, Norma. Goodbye, Mr Darricott. - Goodbye, Mrs Blanton. Au revoir, Miss Page. Goodbye. Mr James Darricott calling for Miss Norma Page. I am sorry, sir. Miss Page checked out of the hotel and left half an hour ago. You are quite sure? Yes, sir. She left this note for you, sir. Thank you. Mr Darricott. You didn't really believe you could order me around, did you? I'm leaving for home as I told you I would at seven-thirty. Or is it goodbye? N.P. Gaston. Come on now. You can do better than this. All aboard. Seeing someone off, Mr Darricott? Don't tell me you're at a loss for words. I'm glad you came to see me off. If you hadn't, there's another train in an hour and I would have taken it. Now. If you still want to show me your New York. Now more than ever. Well? Well. On your left we have the city hall. Is this an automobile or bedroom? It's a loan. From a lady? Naturally. I told the owner I had to call on a sick aunt. And you are the sick aunt. If you don't mind... I'll dismiss it when we get to St Regis. Thanks a lot. A dirty old taxi that everybody rides in... Is so much nicer than some individual's too-private car, don't you think? Or do you? I think. Hello, Jamie. Well, hello. How do you do. I am glad your aunt is better. Oh yes. Much. You are not alone? I'm waiting for Horace and Tony. We dine here and then go on to the play. Yes. That's nice. You'll have a splendid evening. I am sure we shall. Remember me to your aunt. Thanks. She wants to be remembered to you. Doesn't it embarrass you? Meeting her here and dining with me? No. Well... it embarrasses me. We'll go to the Aristide instead. It's nicer anyway. There's been a shooting every night there for the last month. Let's go this way. I suppose Mrs Fendley will hate you after this. No. She will merely hate you. Tell me about her. There's nothing to tell. To her discredit. Which is all that would interest another woman I imagine. How many cocktails have we had tonight? I don't know. I gave up counting at six. Do you want to know why you gave up counting at six? Alright. Why did I give up counting at six? Because you cannot count over six. Hector. Number One for Mr Darricott. Who's that? It's Jamie. The town seems to be dripping with Fendleys tonight. A sick aunt, huh? You dirty liar. Shush. You are a lady. Two tall glasses and some ice water. Won't you sit down? It's just as well you didn't go with mother. Because dad would have sighted you. He's the only one in the whole town who doesn't know of mother's frenzy for you. Jamie. If you and mother don't look out... There will be the loudest eruption since Vesuvius. Did you hear what I said about mother? Everyone has except the drummer. I want to extend to you. By a unanimous vote of thanks. For carrying Jamie off this evening. If you keep him from mother. I'll give you a pension for life. Then, when I want him I'll just take him away from you. Could anything be fairer than that? Shall we dance? We? I may. But we can't. Did you ever dance with Jamie, Miss...? Miss...? I hope you know your own name. I know. I am Miss Fendley if anybody should happen to ask you. But... Where was I? Mother doesn't approve of me dancing with Jamie. She wants to have him all to herself. Rachel. Will you do me a big favor? I'll do you any flavor, honey. Then go home. You are in no condition for public appearances. Jamie, you do me a cruel injustice. Rachel, please. Sit back there where you belong. Well, I'd rather belong to you. I'm mad about you, if you want to know. Shall we dance? So I'll bet you a million. You're on. Nope. I have changed my mind. You're trying to take advantage of me. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Peyton Walden here bets me a million I'll marry him. I'll bet him a million he don't marry me. Come on, Mr Walden. Put your million in Jamie's hands. Very likely. Oh, very likely. - Put up or shut up. Where is your million? Where's yours? I don't have to have mine because you lose. You answered me already. How do you make that out? You bet me a million that you'd marry me. I am the one to decide. I decide you don't marry me. I bet you another million I do. I'll take that back too. Alright. Where's your money? Pay me the million you owe on the first bet and I'll put it up for the second. I don't owe you. - See? You are a welsher. Do you imagine I would marry a welsher? You will marry me. - Never. Never, never speak to me again. Do you hear? Miss whoosis... Would you marry a welsher? Who cares? I'm going to make a riot with you. Rachel. - What do you want? Now listen to me. I want you to get Peyton out of here and take him home. You don't want to make a riot with him. He'll bite himself and die of hydrophobia. I am going home myself. You want me to get old Peyton home? That's it exactly. Miss Page and I are leaving. I got it. I got it. I'll get old Peyton home. Never mind, I'll handle him. Peyton. Peyton, old boy, old boy, old boy. Come on. Go home. I never knew it could get to five in the morning so quickly. I never knew it could get to five in the morning. Where to now? To my hotel if you don't mind. What is the matter? Am I a kill-sport by going home in the middle of the evening? Why, you haven't even seen the skyline from my apartment yet. Mr Darricott. You don't mean you are asking me to your apartment to see your ship models? Or is it your collection of real old English bindings? I haven't read a novel for months, so... I'm not quite sure what the ruse is. When I invite you to my apartment to see the skyline. I invite you to my apartment to see the skyline and that's all. Maybe that's why I am disappointed. It's really the most beautiful sight in the whole city. Particularly at this hour with dawn just breaking over the town. Skyscrapers like so many jagged peaks. The streets. Like so many canyons. Alright. I'll come. Taxi. Sir. I am sorry, Mr Darricott. I tried. I don't understand. I think I understand. What is it? Miss Fendley, sir. Miss Rachel Fendley. Oh. Alright, Eugene. I should hate to interfere with any of your engagements. Please don't go now. I may need your help. Hello. I got rid of Peyton as you told me. And here I am. I told you to get rid of Peyton? Who are you trying to fool? Yourself or Miss... Miss whats-her-name there? I am awful tired. Yes. I can understand that. You've got to go home. - No. I don't want to go home. She cannot go home in this condition. Why not put her to bed here? No. I don't want to go to bed. You want me to help you? - I don't know what I want. What you want most right now is sleep. Jamie. Come on, child. Put your arm around me. There is a bedroom just in there. You'll find everything you need. We women must stick together. No. I don't want to stick together. There you are. Right over here. Jamie. Listen, darling. Over here. Come on. - No. Let me help you. - No. I don't want to go home. No. Me do. No. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. I'll have coffee ready in a few moments, sir. Good. And... Tell the operator downstairs that I am not in to anyone. Very good, sir. I couldn't get her in the tub but she's asleep now. There was a picture in there of her mother. It seemed to bother her a little. A nice little civilization. A million young men and women all over the country at this very moment. Drunk like her. Not to mention their fathers and mothers. [ Aircraft engine sounds ] Our plane. It was going to make the town go round like a wheel with me sitting on the hub. 'You never know New York'. 'Until you see it as the moon sees it'. It was a nice speech. What we call a 'good approach' in golf. But I'm afraid you... You dubbed your putt. We played only the first hole. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. You'd better go. I don't know why I don't kill you, Jamie Darricott. I waited here for you tonight. No-one asked you to wait for me. Who has a better idea? If you are lying to me... If you're not going to marry me I will... I'll kill myself. Rachel. Maybe you don't think I know what I am saying. But I do. Are you going to marry me? Are you? I don't think so. [ Buzzer ] I want to see Mr Darricott. - Sorry, sir. But Mr Darricott is not... You can't stop me. - I already told you, sir. Mr Darricott is not at home. - But I know he's here. Excuse me, sir. - Keep out of my way. Excuse me, sir. One moment. - I've come for my sister. Hello brother of mine. You dirty... - Tony. You keep out of this. Listen. I got sick from liquor and Miss... Miss whoosis here put me to bed. And that's all. And if you weren't such a phoney saint you'd be on your knees to both of them. I am sorry. May I take you... - Home? And let you make an entrance with the erring sister and a few hallelujahs? Ha-ha... and ha. Say. How did you know I was here? Peyton followed you and watched you come into this hotel. Then he phoned me. But he must have known that Miss Page and I... Everybody knows you have your women come up here. You have laid your filthy hands on my family for the last time. I hear so many people say somebody ought to kill you. Shut up! Any woman who has anything to do with Jamie Darricott... Has no-one to blame but herself. Any account I have to settle with him... I settle alone. Get out, Tony. I think I'll go home now if you don't mind. Shall I see you again before you leave? I'm leaving tonight. You may have tea with me if you like. I like. At my hotel then. Say at... Four-thirty? At four-thirty. I'll be there. Goodnight. I don't know what to say about... Don't say it. Thanks. You know. I am beginning to think. What? Never mind. They say you are without a conscience. The more I know of other people's morals the more I realise that... Mine are as good as the next. The only difference I can see is that... I don't pretend. They say you are lazy. Lazier than most people I suppose. Too lazy to... Earn a living perhaps? Norma. Since I can remember anything. I remember being picked up by women. They used to maul me around in my cradle. By and by I learned that I could... Make money by it. I hated to study. I wouldn't run errands or... Deliver newspapers. Keep a lemonade stand. Or do any of the things that kids do to earn a dime. Eventually. I became a bond salesman. But the only opportunities that seemed to come my way were... Well, when some... Skittish dowager needed to be convinced that she wanted bonds. But never a deal involving logic or common sense. That is no excuse. Of course not. But the skittish dowagers... Usually seemed more interested in me than in my bonds. And it was not that I squandered flattery on them. If anything they... They squandered it on me. Why? Perhaps it's because I look at women the way other women look at them. The men make. And the women spend. How many wives let their husbands work themselves to death... And then complain that they're neglected? They spend their husband's money. On other men. On you? On me. Oh, that is... I know. That is everything that's... Low and unspeakable. Then why did you do it? I suppose because I thought I couldn't help myself. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Norma, I am going to ask you something. I shan't mind what your reaction is. Except for one thing. Don't laugh. Please don't laugh. I won't laugh. I used to feel amused when I heard of it happening to other people. But now it's happened to me. And it seems just simple and natural. I love you. But that's not a question. Do you think you could ever... Care for me? That is a question, isn't it? Well. I suppose I could fall for you. I have fallen. Into the clouds. Heaven help me when I start to drop. You don't have to drop. If you do not want to. If I don't want to? Is that your answer to my question? What do you expect me to answer? I don't know. If I thought you could care for me. I could care for... What you might be. I can be what you want me to be. That was the whole job, eh? - Yes, sir. [ Buzzer ] Yes. I will see her in a moment. Thanks very much for your frankness. My detectives traced the jewelry to your shop. We'd have had a lot of trouble getting hold of it all... If you'd been unwilling to cooperate. I always aim to do the right thing, sir. You've done the right thing this time. I'll see that you don't lose by it. - Thank you, sir. Alright. That will be all. Well, Rachel my dear? Hello dad. You're looking very smart it seems to me. Am I? - Hmm. Well? What's the matter? You lost your nerve? You've spent your allowance and you want another check. 'Just this once, daddy'. It's not money. It is much more serious. If it isn't money, you take it from your poor old father that it's not serious. It is very serious. Good gracious. Don't tell me you are in love? I'm not in love with anybody. Well. If you're not in love then... There's something I must talk to you about. Alright. Sit down there and talk to me about it. Well? It's mother. And Jamie Darricott. Mother? And Mr Darricott? What do you mean? You have got to do something about them. Do something? In what way? They're making a fool out of you. My dear child, don't be silly. Dad, you ought to kill Jamie Darricott. You've been reading too much trash. Jamie Darricott is the lowest scoundrel I know. I could torture him for the way he's... The way he has what? - Nothing. It's just that he isn't fit to live. Rachel. Rachel. Listen to me. I trust your mother. Thoroughly. I like Mr Darricott. You must remember that I haven't the time to give to your mother... That she has a right to demand. Mr Darricott kindly took her to the opera and other places when I could not. And that's all there is. Between mother and Mr Darricott. - Dad. You are blind. If that's your only grievance against Mr Darricott. It is your only grievance against him? Isn't it? Rachel. He hasn't become involved with you, has he? Oh, my dear child. I have never seen you like this before. Now look here. If I were you. I would forget all about our little talk. I know more about mother and Mr Darricott. Than you think I do. More perhaps than you do. Dad. And there's absolutely nothing. To worry about. There. Now, you run along like a nice girl. The great banker is going to settle down and make more money. And starve a couple of hundred widows and orphans before nightfall. Goodbye, darling. I am not going to dodge anything. I'll tell Mrs Fendley frankly what has happened. As soon as I can. I am going to repay her. As far as I am able. I will give her back everything that she has given me. Jamie. When you tell her don't be unkind, will you. No. I won't. I won't. And Norma. - What is it, dear? I don't see how I can get out of this... Catherine and Potemkin thing. It's been around town for weeks that she's going to give this ball. I know. You should go. It won't make any difference to me. You know that. I'll be back in a week. You'll not be back in a week. You're going to stay right here. And the day after tomorrow. We're going to be married. What do you say? Of course. You know. It's getting to be a habit with me. Wiring my family that I'm not taking the train after all. When you take that train you will take it as Mrs Darricott. With me. - You mean... You'll meet me at the station again some night at 7:30? I won't meet you at the station. I will take you there. That is definite. - Definite and essential. Because from now on... When you are leaving or arriving. I will be leaving or arriving too. Horace. You frightened me. Did I? I am sorry. Still determined not to go to the ball? Like this? It's going to be sensational. Mary Millbank sent all the way to Paris for her costume. That will be all, Louise. Catherine, eh? And Potemkin? Darricott I suppose? Well, you positively refused yourself to go. So... A great lover, wasn't he? Potemkin. I don't need to tell you what Potemkin was. And... He died... suddenly. Didn't he? Potemkin? I think so. These ladies' men. I suppose they all have a very definite idea that they might run at any time... Into a sudden death? Horace. What are you driving at? Well, if you mean to suggest that... That Jamie Darricott and I are... Why do you think I was referring to Darricott? It's been very nice of him to take me out as often as he has. You were tied up in business or something. I really don't know what I should have done without him. I have an idea that I owe him something. For what he has done for you. Horace. I don't know what this is all about but... Charming jewelry you're wearing tonight. Thank you. You. You haven't worn your emerald bracelet in a long time. Have you? Emerald bracelet? Yes. The one I gave you on your birthday. Oh, that one? I am having it re-set. I imagine Darricott knows a good deal about jewelry, doesn't he? Perhaps. I haven't asked him. You ought to. He might... He might have some very interesting ideas about jewelry. Horace. I insist upon knowing what you have got on your mind. Elaine. I am sorry. I am keeping you from the ball. Goodnight. Hello? Circle 1-6-3-3. Hotel Metropole? Mr Darricott please. Yes. Mr James Darricott. Norma. - Darling. What's happened? I'm sorry I had to phone you to come here but I couldn't very well go to you. I understand, dear. I came as soon as I could. What is it? Mrs Fendley phoned me a few minutes ago. She had just had a talk with her husband. She thinks that he knows about... Everything. Well? Can't you see what that means? It will be one of the nastiest scandals that New York has seen in years. Are you afraid? Yes I am. For you. You'll be a target for every dirty mind in New York. Norma, I cannot let you in for that. I can't let your name be linked with mine. I can't expect you to... To marry me. But. We still love each other. Don't we? My darling. If anything happens to you nobody is going to keep me out of it. What happens to you happens to me. There's no-one who can hurt me, Jamie. Except you. There is nothing I want. Except you. If you still love me? More than anything in the world. Well. That's all that matters then. I expected to find you alone. How do you do. I think I had better go. No. Please stay. I have something to discuss with you that does not concern Miss Page. You must know that. But I've something to tell you, Elaine. I had hoped to tell it to you under... Different circumstances. But I feel it best to tell you now. Miss Page and I... Are going to be married. I don't believe you. Jamie. You can't do this to me. You... you cannot humiliate me before the whole town. I've no intention of humiliating you, Elaine. Oh. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, dear. Just this once. And then it will never be goodbye again. Darling. What else could I expect from a ladies' man? The ladies' man is dead. My Potemkin. And I was worried about you because I thought Horace knew. Well. If he does know. He will divorce me. And you will marry me. Make no mistake about that. You are going to marry me. You are not going to marry that girl. Before you do. I will kill you. Good evening. Good evening, Mr Darricott. Horace. Your guests are waiting for you, Elaine. The Grand March is about to begin. But I can't go without Mr Darricott. You will please go. Now. And to what do I owe the honor of this visit? These. Don't worry. I know you didn't steal them. I am fully aware that my wife... Gave them to you. Mr Darricott please. I believe I heard my wife say just now that she would kill you. She didn't know what she was saying. She knew perfectly well what she was saying. She was mistaken. I am going to spare her that... trouble. [ Telephone ] Don't bother to answer that. I can conceive of nothing. Mister Darricott. That could come to you over the telephone... That would be of importance to you. Now. There you are, my dear. So sorry to have kept you waiting. Such a lovely party, Mrs Fendley. - Do you think so, my dear? It's almost time to start the Grand March. We'll start it just as soon as Mr Darricott comes down. He will only be a moment. He is... he's detained. You really mean to go through with this? If I don't kill you. My wife will. My wife or Rachel. You see, Mr Darricott. I know a good deal more about you than you think I do. Yes. Please try him again. Mr Fendley. I am not going to beg for my life. You may be thoroughly justified in killing me. I only want to say that... Not only for me. But for you. You may be making a great... mistake. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] [ Telephone ] So that's your game, is it? There's a fight up there. - Where? Up there on the balcony. There's two men fighting. Is Mr Darricott here yet? No. That's who they're waiting for. Oh? Thank you. But Mr Fendley. That is, we... I will lead The Grand March. With Mrs Fendley. Mr Darricott has found it impossible to appear. Horace. You... You have...? - We had better start. Stand back now. Stand back. Has anything happened? Plenty. Mr Darricott? Jamie Darricott himself. Look. That guy in the street clothes. Wait. Let him have his fun. He can't get away. What's the matter with you, sister? Were you in love with him too? I am sorry. You don't have to be sorry for me. He loved me. They can't ever take that away from me. FxMay22.
