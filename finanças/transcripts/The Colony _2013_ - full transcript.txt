Get up. Gimme another day. One more day. One more day isn't going to make any difference. Oh, please! Just give me some more meds! You had your meds, Hal. You're getting worse. Put me back in quarantine. Just until tomorrow. I'll get better. You're not gonna get better, Hal. I'll... I'll take the walk. It's my choice. Not today. You can't do this! It's, it's my choice! It's my job. - Make your peace. - Mason! He tested positive, Sam. He has a choice! Let him walk! He'll just come back. They always do. We can't let him infect the rest of the colony. Mason! This isn't right. This is survival! It's nothing personal. His time was up. That's all, Sam. In this place, we live in fear of the common cold. The last flu wiped out twenty people in less than a week. So, now we've got rules. You get sick, you go into quarantine. If you don't get better, you've got a choice... A bullet... or a long walk in the snow. At least that's how it's supposed to work. After the snow started the lucky ones found places like this. Places where life could exist underneath the ice. When I got here, we were hundreds living on top of each other. Everyone just thankful they'd made it out of the cities alive. When the food ran out, most of the people in the world died. But not the people in this place. Where seeds were stored underground... Kept safe. For a better day. Some people, they talk about a place... paradise blue skies and birds as far as you can see. Those are just stories. Everybody knows that. So we hold on. Hibernating, like the last dark age. But it's not the cold we need to worry about. It's each other. - Briggs. - What's up, Sam? - I need to talk to you... - Look. Don't start Hal knew the rules. His blood test was positive and he wasn't getting any better. We don't have the meds to keep fighting this flu anymore. And we can't risk another outbreak. But why do we leave it to the one guy who loves to pull the trigger? Look. This colony started with over 400 people. And I have done too much surface time with a shotgun in one hand and a shovel in the other. I've had my fill of blood in the snow. You understand? Now, Mason is just doing what has to be done. Yeah, but he's not doing it right. He didn't give him a choice. Hal wanted to walk. Not take a bullet. Well, right now, we have a bigger issue. Calling Colony Five, this is Colony Seven. Over. Colony Five, this is Colony Seven. Come on, guys, over... - What's up? - SOS loop from Colony Five. - SOS? - SOS. - You sure it's Five? - It's got to be. It's their code. Marcus always checks in. When was the last time you had contact with him? About seven days. They said they were gonna be down for radio repairs. And they've been dead air until about an hour ago. Okay. Make an announcement. General meeting in the main hall in thirty minutes. - Okay, for who? - For everyone. I want you to go see Viktor, Sam. He's having a problem with the livestock. Right. Attention. All colonists report to the main hall in thirty minutes. I repeat. All colonists please report to the main hall in thirty minutes. Thank you. You're gonna try and save these rabbits too? Another stillborn litter. They need protein. Just like us. How many are left? Twelve in all. But this here... is the only female. You know you're screwed when even the rabbits won't fuck. Let me see what I can get from Kai. Mason! What's going on? - What are you talking about? - What happened out there with Hal? Sam come running to you? What gives you the right to take away a man's choice? His choice was made when he tested positive. That is not how we do things. We give people a choice. It's theirs to make regardless of the outcome. Till they come back. Till the food runs out. It's not a problem. Until it's a problem. You gave me this job to do. Now let me do it. Mason! You know... You'd think for someone who sewed... with you you're give them a little more respect. Almost had you. No you didn't. What do you need? Soy pellets. The rabbits aren't doing so hot. Where's this? Uh, somewhere in Spain I think. You never give up, do you? No. No one thought Briggs could fix that link to that old satellite, but he did. So? So all that weather modification tech is out there. It's just buried under the ice. Well, that's where it should stay. - Buried. - Sam. Somewhere, someone... is working on a fix. And when there's a thaw, I'm gonna find it. Will you take me with you? There's not a lot of choice down here. You'll have to do. Hal is gone. Well, we live and die by our rules, Sam. We should get to the meeting. Breathe slowly. You can't cough. Okay. Hey... I fixed that crack in the vent for you. Thanks. That's great. Dex? - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm good. - You're not looking so hot. - No, no. Up... it's good. Fine. Maybe you should go back to your room, huh? Alright. Listen up. A few hours ago we received a distress signal from Colony 5. They haven't responded to any radio calls. Given that Colony 3 shuttered last year, I think they're worth checking up on. Cooper, I want you to see what kind of radio pans we have to spare. - Okay. - We've got nothing to spare. Mason, we're sending a team and I'm leading it. I need two volunteers. What if they've been hit with a new flu? We'll take all precautions. We'll go into quarantine when we get back. That's what it's there for. Quarantine's a fucking joke. We're barely surviving here. We need to take care of our own, Briggs. We made a pact with Colony Five and we need to look after each other. Yes, we did. And we're going. End of discussion. Dexter. I need a skilled set of hands with me out there. I'll go. Dex needs to stay in case the turbines break down. Thank you, Sam. Anyone else? Look at me... Anyone? - Take me. - Graydon, no... - Please don't go... - No, I know... I haven't logged a lot of surface time, but I can do it. Thank you, Graydon. You'll do well. Alright. Kai will be in charge until I'm back. Rations are still in effect, although I've authorized regular portions for the children. Work details continue as usual. We'll be in touch by radio. She's sick... Come on... Get her out of here! Quarantine until further notice. It's okay, sweetie, don't worry. It's okay... You really should have said something earlier, Dex. - They're done, Briggs. - They're sick. And we follow procedure. They just put the whole colony at risk. We need to give them a test right now. We're gonna wait until I get back and see if they've done any better. Until then Kai's in charge. You really think she can make the tough calls? That's really not your decision to make, is it? Are we clear? Crystal. Mom! Oh my... You okay? Yeah. That fucking dream. It wasn't your fault. Would you come back to bed? The world froze over a long time ago. So long ago that I can't remember the warmth of the sun. I heard stories growing up... How the planet grew hotter as our fuel was burned. How we made towers to work the weather. But the truth is... one day... it started to snow. And it never stopped. Hey! Is that what I think it is? Weather modification. Never seen one this close. You think it still works? It did its damage a long time ago. We got to cross this thing? Unless you wanna go down there... We make our way around to the left! Yeah. Watch your step. Guys! What is that? What the hell's he doing out here? We got to keep moving. God, how cool would it be to fly one of these things, huh? Hey, Briggs, what was this used for? Medevac. It used to airlift people to safety. Ah, I wish I coulda seen that. Briggs to Colony Seven, Cooper, come in. Colony Seven here. Good to hear your voice, Briggs. Copy that. Good to hear yours. We're camped out at the helicopter for the night, so we should reach Colony Five by noon tomorrow. What about you? Got any news? Dex and Elena are still in quarantine. And they're both getting worse. They have all the symptoms. Mason's pushing for the test. Mason knows that's against protocol. That's why I left Kai in charge. Yeah, he's not too happy about that. I know. There's gonna be some changes made when I get back. Cooper, you have my authority to use force if necessary. Mason is not to take them for a walk without my consent. I understand. You guys be safe out there, okay? Over and out. Over and out. Should we give you some time alone with that, or...? Maybe I do. You know, Sam, we're not too far from where I found you. Yeah. What were you doin' out here? Well... it was a long time ago. Go on, tell him. We got all night. Um... my family, um... we were holed up about forty miles north of here. In a mine. Uh, just us and... some mining families, a couple old-timers. We, uh, got supplies in there... shoveled the entrance out every day. Eventually, the supplies ran out. Food ran out. So after we ate the horses and the dogs... my dad and the other men went into the city to go get some help, but... They never came back, so... And people started dying, and... The way things were going, I needed to get them out of there. My mother and my sister... I figured we had a better chance out there. Anyway, uh, the storm came up and... we got separated, and I never saw them again. I'd be dead too if Briggs hadn't found me. You were a boy, Sam. You did the best you could. Yeah. Hey, what is this? You guys that's blood! We shouldn't be going in there! You came here to help. That's what we're gonna do. You smell that? Smoke. You know, maybe one of us should just stay top-side, huh? We stick together. You're coming. Right. - How many were there last count? - Fifty. Not so much of a welcoming committee this time. What the fuck happened here? Hey. You remember how to use this? - Yeah. - You sure? - Let's move, okay? - This way. They're all dead. We don't know that for sure. What the fuck was that? Someone's alive. - It's coming from over here... - Sam. Wait, wait, wait, wait. In here. This door has taken a lot of punishment. Shit. Hey, c'mon, let's get outta here, huh? Hey, find a spine, boy. You got it? What, is he dead? Oh shit! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! - Don't! Don't! - Easy. Easy. - Please, don't... - We're here to help. Please. Don't, don't, don't. It's okay. Calm down. Are you hurt? - Are they gone? - Who? The door! Lock the door. Get the door! He needs water. No, easy. Go easy, easy, easy, easy. What's your name? - Leland. - Leland. Have you got any food? I'm so hungry. Yeah. I've got something here. How long have you been locked in here? I, I don't know. Days. Is there anyone else? Is anyone else alive? Define alive. Good. We're from Colony Seven. We got your distress signal. We came to help. Leland. What happened? We fixed the... steel grid to a new antenna. When, when it finally worked... its reach was, was amazing. We, we received a... a partial transmission. You're gonna love this. I repeat. We have modified a weather tower and successfully reversed the cooling process. Clouds have receded to a three mile radius and are expanding. We have thawed permafrost. We have melted pack ice. We now have soil. We have sun. We now have the conditions to grow. But we have no seeds. If anyone out there can hear this... I repeat our location. Our location... Latitude forty seven degrees north... Is that it? Is that all there is? We triangulated the, the transmission. Sent a team to find the source. But... they never found it. But somebody found them. - And followed them right back here... - Who? Leland! Who followed you...? Look at me. Over here. Show me. On this map. Where did that transmission come from? Point... we're right here. North... on this line. And twenty five degrees is here. South... there. Listen to me. We're gonna take you back to Colony Seven with us. No! Please, sir. I, I'm gonna stay here. Right here... behind this door. What if they're still here? There's no one here. We only knew that you were here because of the knocking. Yeah, but I didn't knock. They're still here! They're still here. Radio Colony Seven. You tell them we're on our way back. - It's time for us to pack up and go. - Yeah. - Take anything we can carry. - Okay... it's okay. It's alright. Calling... Colony Seven. Colony... Seven, can you read me? Over. Colony... Seven, come in. This is Graydon calling in. Can you read me? Over. It's not working. Alright. We're too deep underground. We'll radio ahead to when we get back topside. You. Leland. You're coming with us. You don't understand! It's safe behind this door! There's fifty colonists. You're the only one behind it. I, I, I couldn't open it. I, I, I just couldn't. Get him on his feet. - No. Please. - C'mon. Let's go. What the fuck was that? Shit... He locked himself back inside. C'mon. Graydon, let's go! We shouldn't be here. This has nothing to do with us. Turn that light out. Oh my God... We got to go, Sam. Now! Go! Go! Go! Go! C'mon! Fuck. Fuck! Come on, Sam... Come on... Damn... Graydon. He's gone. We got to move. Go on. Go! Go! Go! Come on! - Oh! Fuck! I'm out! - Come on! Go! Go! Briggs! Here! Gimme your hand! Gimme your hand. There's still people alive down there. We can't help them, Sam. We can't help them. Briggs! Don't you think we should keep moving? No! The temperatures dropping too fast. We won't make it! Come on... - Briggs? - Yeah? Those people... How could they...? I don't know, Sam. When people are desperate they'll do... horrible things to survive. I told you I was an Army captain... during the relief effort, right? Yeah. Yeah, well, I never told you what I saw... when... when people lose control like that... When we go feral... there's nothing human left in us at all. We might as well just be a pack of wild dogs. See, during the relief effort, we had uh... twenty thousand people corralled in a stadium. Food got handed out. And the sick got treated. But when the food ran out.. The people with guns stand taking things from the people without guns. And then... when there was nothing left to take... they took people upstairs and decided who would live and who would die. It was... it's the hunger. People couldn't take it. It just drove them mad. We tried to stop it. We really did but... we couldn't. Me and Mason he was my squad back then. We, we left. Tried to find a place where we could make sure... nothing like that would happen. You did. Maybe. You did. That transmission... When we get back... we'll patch in to the satellite. Take a look. If they've got the sun, we've got the seeds. No... - No, no, no! - How many? Twenty! Maybe more! It's hard to tell! Oh, fuck. Our footprints! Oh shit! We're gonna lead them right back... - to the colony... - We'll stop them at the bridge. Come on. Come on! Come on! - Briggs, what are you doing? - Stopping 'em! Block the wind! - No! - What? - The fuse is out! - Fuck! - I'm gonna go and relight it. - The fuck you're doing? Briggs? Listen to me. Listen to me. We're fine. I light it. I come back. We go home. It's too late! Briggs! Come on. Come on! Get it done! Come on! Come on! Yes. Come on, you dogs! Please! Just give her the goddamn test! No more tests. No! Oh no! No. Mason! What... Things are gonna change around here. Are you fucking crazy? No. I'm seeing things clearly. You know the test is bullshit. The delay just puts us all at risk. Drop your gun! Help! Help! Sam?! Sam! Oh fuck... Fuck! Sam! Sam? Sam? Come on, come on. Hey... You're okay. You're safe. How long have I been out? A few hours. Sam? Where is he? Where's my boy? I tried. No... No... We lost Briggs too. Mason, what are you doing? There's been a change in command. We need to take precautions. Briggs' rules don't work anymore. We need to be tougher to survive. From now, rations will be cut in half. Anyone showing signs of sickness will be tested immediately. If you don't pull your weight, - you don't eat. - Mason. Where's Kai? What happened, Sam? What happened out there? They killed them. Everybody at Colony Five is dead. Briggs' come off the bridge. - Stopped them. - Stopped who? These people... They slaughtered everybody. For food. Do you understand? And they're coming here. And unless we get out of here... they will kill us. And where are we gonna go? There's a thaw. I know where it is. Okay. I can get us out of here. - I can show you where it is... - He's in shock. - I can lead you to where it is. - Give him a sedative. Let me show you where it is! No one is going anywhere. Viktor, let's go topside. - You need to listen to me! - Viktor! Are you with me? Mason. You need to listen to me. Mason! Mason! Sam. What? No. Nothing. You know, Sam says a lot of things but he's not a liar. If he says something's coming for us, we better be ready for 'im. Keep an eye on the monitors. - Sam! - Kai, are you okay? - Oh my God! Did he hit you? - It's fine. - Did he hit you? - I'm fine! Are you okay? Here. Come here. What happened out there? I got to show you something. Bring up two. Nothing. This is bullshit. Mason! Sam got away. And how did he do that? That little bastard. Come on! Let's go! Forty-seven, fifty-five... - What are you looking for? - A thaw. - Come on. - Sam. Sam, there's nothing there. I have already looked. No, it's here. I know it's here. Sam. Come on. There it is. Holy shit. Look. Oh my God... That's got to be like eight miles of blue sky. Come. Let's go. Come on. Come on. They took the weapons, the maps, everything. Shit. They didn't take these. What are you doing, Sam? Sam, what are you doing? We need to tell the others... and we need to get the hell out of here. Let's go. Come on. C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! - Going somewhere? - Yeah. We're gonna get everyone together and we're leaving. No one's leaving. - Go fuck yourself, Mason. - Hey, hey... if we don't leave... right now... Briggs is gone. I'm running things now. When everyone's dead, huh? And you're King of the fucking castle, then what? I'll still be running things. Oh shit. We're too late. Oh my God... Oh my, oh my God, it's Dex. You believe me now? Anyone who can fire a weapon, get 'em to the entrance. We'll hold them there. And get everybody else to the vault! Let's go. Come on! Come on, buddy. Let's go. It's gonna be alright. Come on, guys! Let's go, let's go! You lead them straight to us. They're breaking the hinges. Fuck... Behind us! They're already inside. In the vents. Mason! Here they come! Viktor! Viktor! Fall back! No! No more running! Everybody in the main hall! - I'm out. - We couldn't make it to the vault. - What the hell is going on out there? - They're inside. They're everywhere. There's no time! No! Don't! No! Let us in! Let us in! - What are you doing? - Saving our lives. No! Let us in! Mason! Doors! You locked us out of here... Yes. - You fucking piece of shit! - The doors aren't gonna hold. We need to get the fuck outta here! This leads to the surface! You'll freeze, if those things don't find you first. It's out only chance! No, we stay. - Hold them off here. - Come on. Let's go! We stay! Just leave him. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go! Come on, all of you. Let's go! Nothing personal. You're gonna need every bullet. Come and get it, mother fucker. Oh, fuck. What do you want? More... Kai. Look. Sam! Sam! Sam! What do we do now? We walk. With these... at least we have a chance. Now come on. Come on. Let's go. We used to live and die by the rules we made... Come on... But our rules like everything else we built... are breaking down. There's only one rule left now anyway. One... rule above all. Survive. Come on.
