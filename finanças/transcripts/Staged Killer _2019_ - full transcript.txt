- Alright, everybody give it up for the Flying Komplowsky Brothers, alright. - Yeah, thank you guys very much. Thank you so much. - Alright, joining us now here on Campus Cool we have got your MVP of Saturday night's game. Everyone please help me welcome your star quarterback, Cole Smith! Come on up here, Cole, all right. - Get on up here. - Cole! - Hi, Cole, thank you for joining us. I'm sure everyone wants to know what we can expect for the next game. - Well, Naomi, I'd kind of like to know what you think our strategy should be? - Well, I think if they just focus on that rocket right arm of yours-- - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Ugh, technical difficulty. - What? - Until next time! - Soar, Eagles, soar! Alright, thanks Cole. - I'm sorry. - Nah, that's okay, thank you. - Well, another great show for the dynamic duo minus, you know, the technical stuff there. - Yeah, listen, Naomi... I was hoping maybe tonight we could... - Come on, let's grab a beer. - Okay. - It's been what, two weeks since we broke up and you've already moved on? - Lana, can we talk about this outside-- - No, never touch me again! Ever! - Alright, and we are back. So before the break, Olivia, you were saying that this new soft baby carrier is perfect for the working mom on the go. - Yes, that's right Naomi. As you can see it's very durable and adjustable making it perfect for the mom on the go. So you can get all your errands done and not neglect your baby. - Huh, I love it. - I don't know, Naomi, that looks pretty good on you. Maybe it's time for you and that perfect husband of yours, Trent, to have a little baby of your own, huh? - Okay, okay. Yeah, well, right now my mornings are a little full with you already Robert. So let's just leave it there for now. Okay. Alright, you guys that's our show for today. See you guys tomorrow. Morning Naomi - I thought you did great. - Good show guys, good show. Not great, but good. Yeah, I just got off a call from the network, and TW Studios, our biggest competition, has once again, surpassed us in our new targeted demographic. As you know it is a copycat industry, so I am coming to the two of you for any ideas on how to bring us to fresh eyes, new households? - We'll give it some thought. - Great, we'll circle back to that. - Cool. - Guess we're not trending like we used to be. - Yeah, I guess, we just gotta be a little more current. Like I would currently kill for a cup of coffee, but I'm off to my cardiologist, so thank you. - Bye. - Well, now that I've done my duty as the mean boss for the day, how about lunch with your bestie? - I can't actually Trent is stopping by the studio. He's downtown for his big presentation. Today is the day. - Oh, that's right. Well, in this case congratulations in advance because I know he got the project. - Thanks, I'll call you after. - Yes, okay. - Okay. Bye, guys. - Alright. - Bye. - Love you Naomi. - Is that one I picked out? - Yes, it is. - Ah, I thought so. I could really get used to my husband coming to visit me at work in the middle of the day. - Really, well, how about the next year? - You got the job. - Hmm-mm. You're now looking at the lead architect of what the mayor has called the city's defining development. - Babe, oh, that is amazing. I guess, all those months practicing your presentation fresh out of the shower nothing but a towel actually paid off. - I guess they have. I'm just glad I remembered to wear a suit. - Well, it's probably best you did. But I'm gonna miss our practice sessions. - Oh, so am I. - That's amazing, babe. You worked so hard. - We worked hard we're a team remember? - Yes. - Speaking of working hard, how's the show? - Good, we had Olivia on again today. - Okay, and? - And there are a lot of great products out there for the working parent. - And the non-working parent? - What do you mean? - Well, with this job I'm gonna be making a lot of money and enough to support both of us, so if you were considering taking off the next couple of years to focus on, you know, building our family, now might be the right time. - Well, we did always say we knew that time would come. - Hmm-mm. - But I just can't picture my life without the show. - Well, maybe you don't have to. It is geared towards working moms, right? - Yeah, I mean, maybe I would connect more with my audience if I was an actual working mom. - Well, think about it just know that I am here, and I'm gonna support anything for our team. Okay. - I mean, our announcement would be quite the on-air announcement. - Hmm-mm. - And it would help us in the targeted demos. You know what I'm gonna figure all that out later. Right now it is all about my handsome, very successful husband. Let's go celebrate. - Let's go, come on. - Hi, there. I was hoping to make an appointment with Mrs. Spinner. - Oh, you'll have to see the show secretary for that. I just open and close the gate. - Right. How's that coffee? - Best in the city. It's right down the street. Naomi brings me one every day. - Oh, I'll have to try it sometime. You have a good day. - Before you go calling some hot-shot attorney to challenge this decision, here's a generous severance check to keep your head above water. Please, have your dressing room cleared out by the end of the day. - Hi, two regulars, please. Just keep the change. Thank you. - Naomi Brown. - Jake Everett. - Wow. Wow, what are the odds? - I mean, what it's been like 10 years or something. - Yeah, and it's Naomi Spinner now, right? - That is right. - Oh, congratulations. - Thank you. - I guess, it's kind of impossible not to hear about what's going on with people these days. - Yeah, the last I heard you were in Florida. - I was, but now I'm here. I've actually caught your show every day I've been here, which is twice now. - Okay. - You've come along way from Campus Cool. - Oh, yeah, wow, those were some fun times. - Yeah, you still remember? - Of course, you were the first one to ever get me up on the stage. Taught me everything I know. - Oh, nah, you were a natural and so pretty. - Awe, are you still hosting? - I am, yeah, I had a great job down in Florida, but I felt creatively stifled. I need something fresh, so I came here. I'm actually looking to set up hosting job interviews in the area if you know anybody who's looking? - Oh, well, I'm sorry Robert and I-- - Not you and Robert, no, no. You and Robert I see your faces all over town. - Well, you know what we should exchange emails, and that way keep in touch if I hear of anything. - Oh, I can do you one better. All my contact info is on there. - Oh, professional I remember that about you. - Yeah, yeah. - Well, it was so great running into you. - Yeah, yeah. - Bye. - Oh, Naomi. - Yeah. - Soar Eagles. - Soar! - Soar! - Good one, babe. That was a strong 10 today last sprint was great. Good. - You're gonna kill me. - Good work, good work. - Thank you. - That was good. - Oh, my god, I'm gonna get in the water. - And I'm gonna go get some water. - Oh, I forget to tell you who I ran into today. - Who? - You remember that guy I told you about from along time ago Jake? - Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. The guy from the gig at the college, yeah. Yeah, the one they charged with murder. - He was never actually charged. He was the lead suspect. - Not charged, lead suspect it all sounds a little suspicious to me. I bet you he wasn't the most popular guy on campus. - Well, he was cleared, but by then the damage was done. And then he wanted to continue the show, but I was hesitant because of everything that happened. You know, I could tell it hurt him, and then the next thing I knew he was gone. Anyway, he seems to be doing great now. He just moved back to try and break into the bigger market and he needs a job. - Yeah, well, good. Why don't you give Scarlet a call. Maybe she could help him out. - That's a good idea. I do feel like I still owe him, you know. - I mean as long as. - What? - Well, you don't believe that he really did what they accused him of, right? - Babe, no, I don't. - Okay, good give Scarlet a call. - So I think that bit worked. - I think, it was great the way she rolled with the audience. - Well, you know, it's a topic that our whole audience-- - Another great show, guys. You have a visitor. - Hey, I'm so glad you can make it. - Of course, thanks for having me. - The old Campus Cool duo back together. - Yeah, I told her how we go way back. - Yeah, Robert, better watch out, right? - Watch out for what? - Robert, Scarlet this is an old friend of mine Jake Everett. He just moved here from Florida. He was a host at the Sunshine Network. - It's very nice to meet you, Jake. - Oh, I told Jake that he should stop by the studio, and I thought it would be good for you two to meet. - Please. Oh. Wow, you're definitely qualified. - Yeah. Well, it's... Definitely nice meeting you, Jake. I got some egg whites to eat right now, and I gotta run. - Don't make light of this, Robert, and don't forget about your shake. - Hey, she's right. - Yeah, two green shakes a day, no coffee, actually no stimulates whatsoever, yep, my life has become completely boring. - You got this. - Thank you. Abby, you got a sec I wanna run something by you. - Yeah, sure, let's do it. - Great show. - Uh, Jake, I would love to show you around. Give you a little tour. - Great. Hey, I made you something. - Oh. - Hey, Jake, let's go. Your good looks will only buy you so much time. - It's amazing. You think I could swing by tomorrow, catch a live taping? - Oh, definitely just ask for me. Oh, this is the network I gotta take this. You know your way out? - Yep, I think I can manage. - Oh, great. Yeah, this is Scarlet. - So, Abby, what were you saying? - Well, Quick Snap Live is the most popular streaming platform my generation uses, so this is it. - Oh, wow. Yeah, no, this is exactly What Scarlet's been talkin' about we need. I'm gonna bring this up in tomorrow's preshow meeting. - Okay, awesome, it's really interactive, so it gets the audience involved, in what we're doing, which, I think, is really gonna help us. - Until next time. - Soar, Eagles, soar. - All right. - Such great chemistry. - Yeah, it was fun. I mean, if you block out the boot cut jeans and totally dated tube top. - Well, I'm not exactly looking at the wardrobe if you know what I mean. - Yeah, I noticed. - He's coming to the live taping tomorrow. - I saw you and Jake had some of your own chemistry. You know, I have a feeling Jake coming to town is going to be great for both of us. - I agree. - Hi, I feel so stupid. I think, I left my folder in the makeup room. - Well, no one is really in there at this time. But go ahead, Mr. Everett. - Thank you. Thank you. - Two more. Let's get this over with. - Oh, my god, Robert. Abby, Scarlet! Help! Hurry it's Robert! - What's wrong? - Call an ambulance hurry! - Oh, my god. - Robert, oh, my god. I don't know what to do, hurry. - We have an emergency at Live City Studios. I think, he's having a heart attack. - Hurry! We have to go with him to the hospital. - We can't. - What happened? - Robert had a heart attack. - What. - Alright, everyone, listen up. I know this is a sad time, and we are all deeply worried about our family member Robert. But we have to pull ourselves together. We still have a show we need to focus on. - We're going on? - Yes, the show must go on. - I don't know how I'm gonna be able to tell our audience. - You won't. The live audience doesn't arrive for another 20 minutes. No one knows about this yet. We are not in a position with the network to lose a host, not to mention, we are live, meaning there's no preemptive programming available. - So I'm supposed to go on like nothing happened. - Just for today until we can figure everything out. Alright, guys, that's the plan. Let's get back to work. - You got this. - He didn't look good, Jake. - Well, there's nothing you can do about that right now. Like Scarlet said the show must go on. Do I have to drag you up there on stage like I did the first time? You'll do great. I am gonna go. Today is not a good day to be in the way. - No, don't go. Please, I want you here. - Well, then I will be whatever you need. - Thank you. - Lights on camera three please. - And we're live in three, two, one. - Good morning, and thank you for spending your mornings with... - Naomi and Robert. - Okay, obviously, I am a man down today. Unfortunately, my ever-present cohost is feeling under the weather today. But that's okay. We still have a really great show for you planned. Yes, I will be covering the current events on my own today. But don't worry. - Oh, crap she's losing it. - We really do have a great show for you. - No, no, no get in there. - What? - You did it before. You're good with her go. - It's not moving. Overseas... Just one second can you go back? 'Cause I missed the headline. The teleprompter back one second. 'Cause I can't see the headline-- - Hi, everybody. Hi, my name's Jake Everett. I'll be joining Naomi today. What Naomi's trying to say is in overseas news... Wait a minute, you guys don't wanna hear about this, do you? - No. - No! Let's turn these cameras around, and hear from you the audience. House lights come on up. Yeah, yeah. Let's get you guys involved here. Say, hello, everybody. - Hi. - Big time wave. There we go. What's your name ma'am? - Hi, it's Beth. - Hi, Beth. You are live on TV and on the internet here. - Hi! Hi! Oh, I wanna meet Naomi too. - Of course, Naomi come on out here. Say, hi, to your fans. Big round of applause for Naomi everybody. All right. Here she is. - Hi, Beth. - The lovely Naomi. - Hi, nice to meet you. Hi, everyone. - Hi! - Alright, today, Naomi, on the show we have a favorite celebrity guest, Chef Willard of the Nepal Bistro. - Oh, yes, that's right they actually brought in my souffle for him to test out. - Uh-oh, Chef Willard better watch out. - Alright, so we will be back with Chef Willard stay tuned. - That's commercial break. We'll be back in three minutes. - Oh, thank you. - Of course, I always got you. - You guys were great. - Thanks. We're very greatful! - Fantastic you two. Uh, keep with the livestreaming it's genius. We're already trending on Chatter. - Okay. - And we're back. - Yep. Welcome, back everybody. Now our chef, Chef Willard. Babe, I had no idea Robert was that sick. I knew Robert's condition was serious... but you never expect to really lose someone. - I bet he knew he was a lot... a lot more sicker than he let on. - I'm really gonna miss him. - Yeah. Yeah. - Promise me nothing is ever gonna take you away from me. - No, stop, stop. - No, promise. - Nothing's ever gonna happen, I promise. Nothing's ever gonna happen to me. Nothing. I got you. - Robert was so full of life, and he had fun in everything that he did, which is why I know that Robert would have really wanted us to spend today and have fun and celebrate his life. So thank you all so much for coming today. I really know it would've meant a lot to him. - That was lovely, babe. - Thank you. I see you guys finally got a chance to meet. - You guys did such a great job, putting all this together. I'm sure Robert is smiling down appreciating all you've done. - Um, god, please excuse the awkwardness of talking shop on such an occasion, especially one honoring Robert. But I do have some news I'd like to share. I just got the numbers back from the week that Jake has been filling in. And Mornings With Naomi and Jake are up 200% in the network's new targeted demo. - Really. - That's incredible. - So, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that they, and I, and I'm assuming Naomi, would like to turn your part-time duties into a full-time replacement. - This is everything I've wanted for so long. - Then it's settled the dynamic duo are back together again. - That's my first official day here at Mornings with Naomi and Jake, and it's all thanks to you guys. - And we are very grateful to have Jake here. As always thank you for spending your Morning with-- - Naomi and Jake. - Till next time guys. - Thank you. - See you. - And we're out, house lights up. - Great job. - It was good, yeah. - Hmm, oh, yeah, I wish I could have another glass. But that morning comes so early. - So Trent Naomi was telling me about your latest project. I looked it up it seems amazing. - Going to change the entire face of downtown. - Great, you know I never met a super successful architect before. I would love to come down to the site and check it out if that's possible? - Of course, I'm the boss I can get you clearance. - That's great, that's great. Honestly, architecture has always been kind of a secret passion of mine. - Well, you know what you guys should do a livestream from the site. I mean, it would get people excited that are in the area, and I'm sure the investors would love the advanced publicity. - That's a great idea. I mean, involving the community even more. - Consider it done. - I'll check on it. - All right. - Yeah. - Okay, you guys I'm sorry, but some of us have a 4:00 a.m. wake up call. - Well, I will see you down at the site sometime soon then. - Yeah, yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Can I leave something? - No, no, I got this. - You sure. - Go, go, go, yeah. - Okay. - All right. - Bye, sweetie. - See you in the morning. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye. - Check my phone. - I know that look. - It's Jake. He's just letting me know that he's gonna be live with Trent down at the site in a few. - Is he letting you know anything else? - Shut up. No, but he did say that the last few nights have been, "mind blowing," his words not mine. - Wow, so things are heating up. - Girl, it's been hot. Were you two really always just friends? - Yes. - God, I just find that hard to believe. I mean, he's the whole package. - I mean, I guess there was a moment where maybe I thought there could be more, but I didn't wanna interfere with the show. - Always the professional. - And then he left for school, and I didn't see him since. I literally bumped into it a couple weeks ago. - I mean, all that time and you guys never talked or anything. - Things didn't exactly end on the best of terms. - Oh, feelings got involved. - No, nothing like that. - You know, I wanted to ask you something else. - No, I don't care that my boss and my costar are gettin' it on and taking the show to the bedroom. - No, it's um... I wanted to ask you does the name Cole Smith sound familiar? - Who said that name to you, what Jake? - No, no, no, um, it's just someone made a not-so-nice comment about a Cole Smith on the stream thread, and I didn't know if that sounded familiar to you or not. - Cole Smith is the name of the quarterback of our school. He was murdered. - Oh, what does that have to do with Jake? - Get a load of this. What do you guys think? Oh, they love it look at that. Look at chief. Wow. Okay, looks like we are out of time. Thank you all for tuning in. Be sure to watch us bright and early tomorrow morning. We got a great show for you live from the studio. Say goodbye, Trent. - Bye, guys. - See ya. - That was fun. The people seemed to be excited. - Oh, yeah, this is great for us, thanks again. - I'll give you the tour. - Are you sure? - Of course, you're my special guest. But we need to get you a hard hat first. - Okay. - Wait I don't get it? I mean, if Jake was wrongfully accused, then why can't you guys just pick up where you left off? - Even though I knew Jake could never kill someone. - What? - You know, after everything that happened, we really couldn't pick up where we left off, I mean, at least not with the show. - Yeah. - So, you know, Jake made it very clear that Campus Cool meant everything to him. I never meant to hurt him, you know, but I did. So that's why when he popped back up into town, I wanted to help him, and that's why this show is so special to me because it's like a second chance. - Did they ever catch the guy who did it? - A she actually. Guys ex-girlfriend Lana Jones. I heard not to long ago she was released early for retrial. I don't know something about insufficient evidence. Anyway I'm gonna head back to the studio and get a little extra prep in for tomorrow. - Of course, you are I'll see you in the morning. - Bye. - I would love a beer you want one? - No, no, no, no I'm still on the clock. - Come on, you're celebrating. Let me get you one. - Okay. - Hi, two beers please. Thank you. Thanks. Here you go, sir. Cheers. To new ventures. - Speaking of, you and Scarlet, huh? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll see. I know it's not the smartest thing to get involved with your boss, but not everyone has what you and Naomi have. It's tough out there. - Yeah, I remember. - You got any tips on how you make her so happy? - After three years, I think, it's just really about paying attention to what she likes. - Oh, yeah, I remember in college it was chicken nuggets and vanilla milkshakes from Johnny's Diner. - Yeah, she told me about your late-night meeting in your special booth. - Oh, wow, she told you about that, yeah. - I used to get jealous until I married her and forgave her. - I'm sure her tastes have changed since college though. - Don't be too sure about that. - Hmm? - No. She loves purple tulips, long jogs in the park, uninterrupted I made add, and, yes, she still loves vanilla milkshakes, and now that Johnny's is out of business, the Shake Barn is her favorite place now. - Shake Barn. - Yeah. - I'll have to check that out. - Listen I don't know how much Naomi has told you about our college days, but I want you to know one man to other, you've got yourself a very special woman. I noticed it the first time I saw her. - I appreciate that. Yeah, this reunion and the show has made Naomi very happy. - You know what they say: Happy wife, happy life. - You got that right my friend. - You okay, Bud? - Yeah. Yeah, eh, no. Wow, I just got really dizzy. You know what I need to get back to work. - Yeah, I'll take care of this here. You gotta get back for your inspection, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Whoa. - Whoa. Sure you're okay? - It's just... - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. - No, this one here let's go here. - It was a half a beer, right? - Yeah, alright, you should be fine. You look good, you look better. - It was a half of a beer, man. - I know it's nothing. - I got it, I got it. - You good? - Hmm-mm. - Okay. I'll get the door for you. - It was a half a beer. - Yeah. - Am I alright to drive? - Yeah? - I'm alright, right? - You're good. Don't worry about it. - Okay. Keys, keys, keys. Okay, okay. All right. Okay. Let's go. - This will not be good for community confidence in the project, Trent, not that you'll be around to see it. Extra thick with whip cream. - What? - Right. - Yes, you remembered? - How could I forget. It's no Johnny's, but. - Shake Barn next best thing. - Trent mentioned you were gonna be sticking around a little later tonight. - He did? Yeah, he didn't tell you. Yeah, he took me to lunch today. I guess, he wanted to thank me for doing the livestream from the site. - No, he didn't tell me. You guys are like real buds now. - I guess so, yeah. Speaking of which, I obviously care about guys a lot, so I hope it's not out of place for me to bring this up. - Bring what up? - Never mind I'm sure it's nothing. - No, tell me we're friends. - Well, just does Trent sometimes drink on the job? - I mean, he might have a beer with lunch every now and then. - Okay. 'cause he had a few today, and I didn't think he was in any condition to drive. I tried to stop him, but he kept insisting he was fine. - Well, that doesn't sound like Trent at all. - Look, I'm sure it's nothing. Maybe he's just stressed out. He's under a lot of pressure with this new project. - Yeah, maybe. - Well, I gotta run, enjoy that shake. - Thank you. Hello, this is Naomi. Yes, he is my husband. Oh, my god. Yes, I'll be right there. Oh, my god. - You have reached Chad Woods. Leave a message, and I will get back to you. Have a sun filled day. - Hi, there this is Scarlet Lee calling from Live City Studies. I'm calling about a Jake Everett. I've recently employed him, and I know that he was a former employee of yours. And I know he's coming off of a successful run with your network, and I just had a couple of questions for you. If you'd please give me a call back, I'd really appreciate it, thank you. - Good morning. - Oh, ma'am, no, you're supposed to sit back on. - Annie, get in here I need my syringes! - Hey. - Hey, you're up. - Barely. - It's gonna be okay, okay? What's important now is that you get your rest. - I just don't understand what happened. I mean, the last thing I remember is having a beer with Jake, and then. - It was an accident. You've been working so hard. You probably didn't know how run down you were. We both didn't. - No, I wasn't run down. I would've known. - Maybe you had too much to drink. - What, no, I had one beer. - You know what let's not worry about that right now. I am just so grateful that you are okay. - Why don't you go home and get some rest? - No. - Look who's up. I knew you wouldn't be out for too long. - Yeah, for now. I was just telling Naomi that she should go home and get some rest. - I'm not leaving you. - But you have a show to do. - You're more important than the show, and I'm gonna stay here as long as you need me, and I know you would do the same. - Yes, I would, but I don't have Scarlet to answer to. - He's got a point there. - Besides I'm gonna be fine. The show must go on. - Well, be that as it may, you don't need to worry about that. You just focus on resting up. Maybe he's right. Maybe it would be good to check in at home come back later. - Yeah, if you're not gonna listen to me, at least listen to Jake. - I can take ya. - Okay. - Thanks, Jake. - I love you. - I love you too. Hey, you take care of my wife. - You bet. - Thank you. - You good? - Okay... there we go. Three scrambled eggs, not too runny but still soft. Oh, and, ketchup on the side. - Wow, you really do remember everything. - All those late-night breakfasts at Johnny's Diner in our booth after our shows, I think, I could order for you. Hey, just so you know, if you really feel like you can't go on air tomorrow, I'm comfortable flying solo. You just take your time, do what's best for you and Trent. - Thank you, but Scarlet should be here any second to come up with a game plan. I'm sure she has some creative twist to work in my husband's near-death experience. - Well, I've always got your back, know that. You need to be taken care of right now. - And Trent. - Right, and Trent. - Hello. Naomi. Hello. Naomi. Oh. I didn't know you were gonna be here. - Jake just dropped me off. - And you made breakfast. - He did. - Oh, wow. You really can do it all, huh? - I had completely forgotten to eat since the accident. - Well, I guess, it's good that you're both here. Now that Trent is on the mend, we can talk about moving forward with the show. - I told Naomi that I could host solo till she feels up to it. - I'm open to that. - No, I'll go on. I think, it's best for me. - You know, maybe we can use this to our advantage. You know, try to go after the audience's heart, boost our ratings even more. - Let's not go there. - Okay, I'm sorry. I sometimes forget to turn off my producer switch. - You know, I like eggs too. - Oh, right, of course. - So, how did you feel? How did you feel about it? - I think, good, yeah. - Well, I think you were fantastic. I mean, I knew you'd pull it together once the camera started rolling. Oh, and what you sprinkled in about Trent's injury I mean, you came across vulnerable while yet still remaining your strong independent woman that everyone knows and loves. - Thank you. - Hey, do you remember what you told me about Jake being accused of murder back in college? - Of course, why? - What was the last you heard of Lana Jones? - Just what I told you. Her case was thrown out, and then she was released a few years later. Where is all this coming from? - Well, "LJ1" is the one who's been writing those weird unpleasant messages. I'm assuming that's her, right? - Are you sure? - Unless it's a crazy coincidence. Look we can't risk even the slightest hint of a scandal. We have to protect the show. - Yeah, of course. - Oh, is it good news. - Yes, okay, so they're just waiting on some blood work to come back but they think he's gonna be released soon. He should be home in a couple days. - That is good news. - Hi, look at you. How sweet, you just keep getting better and better. - These are actually for Naomi. - Oh. - Oh. - Thank you. - I knew you had a tough day today, and I'm sure all your thoughts are with Trent so I just wanted to brighten your day a little bit. - These are my favorite. - Of course, they are. - Doing real good today. You doing very good today. - Hi, guys. - Hey. - How are you doing today? - All right. - I brought you a pudding. - Oh, how thoughtful. - It's the only thing edible in here. And one for you. - Oh, my god. - We are assumed discharged usually within 12 hours. - Okay, yeah. Can I help you? Jake Everett. I am a huge fan. - Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Sorry is it okay if I steal one of these puddings? - Yeah, of course. Pudding for a picture. - That's a deal let's do it. - Okay, my phone's right here. Got it. - Awesome, that looks great. - Thank you so much. - Fantastic. You're welcome. - You sure know how to make a girl's day. - Thanks, doll, you're the best. - Here we go. - Thank you. - Okay, yeah. Oh, don't forget a spoon. - Hello, this is Scarlet Lee. - Ms. Lee, I apologize for the delayed response. I'm not sure where you received your information. But we terminated Mr. Everett. - Terminated, why? - I'm not allowed to get into detail. Let's just say it had to do with his past. - And does this past, by chance have anything to do with a Lana Jones? - Bingo, sounds like you've done some homework. I, obviously can't recommend him for employment at this time. - Got it. - Good. Ms. Lee, trust me. There's a lot of things I'd like to say about Jake. But this whole incident already cost us a pretty penny. - Understood, thank you for calling me back. - Dr. Maslow said your blood tests results came back, and you were well under the legal limit for alcohol. So he wants to run more tests and see what could have caused this episode. - I told you I didn't drink that much that day. Jake is still coming here, right? - Yeah. - Hey, Buddy, how you holding up? - Hey, I still don't remember what happened that day. - Well, one thing we all know, you gotta keep eating. - Oh, he's right, babe. - Sweets are about the only thing that's edible in here, right? - You got that right. - I will leave you two. - Already. - Yeah, I gotta get to the gym, and then dinner with Scarlet, so. You guys let me know if you need anything. - Thank you. - Hey, Jake. - Yeah, Bud. - Before the accident happened that day, did you help me get into the truck? - No. No, you kept insisting you were fine. Then you took off. - I could've sworn you did. - No, maybe I should have. Maybe I shouldn't have let you drive at all. - No, it was an accident. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm just thankful you survived. - Yeah, me too. - Hey, are you okay. - Yeah, yeah, I just... I got a little light headed. - Do you want me to call the nurse? - No, no, no I'm fine. I'm just gonna close my eyes and get some rest. - Yeah, okay. - Hi. - Hello. - Come in. - I see you look beautiful as always. - Thank you. - It smells amazing. - You're sweaty. - Yes, take a shower is that cool? - Yeah, of course, dinner won't be ready for another 20, so. - Okay. - Yeah. - Check his vitals! - What's going on? - Please stay back, ma'am, we're handling this! Hey, we need to get a doctor in here! - Excuse me, what's wrong with my husband? - Get her out of here please! Preparing defibrillate. - What's happening! - Get her out of here please! - What do we got? - On three. One, two, three, clear! - Check pulse. - None. - Start compressions. - I think, he's moving into a cardiac arrest. - Four, five, six. - Hit him again, a 120 joules. - Three, clear. - Check for pulse! Anything. - None. - Compressions. - One. - That was amazing. You are amazing. - Thank you. I'm happy to hear that. I was starting to think I was in competition with Naomi. - Naomi? That's ridiculous. You're funny too. You cooked. I will do the dishes. Why don't you go upstairs and have a nice relaxing bath. - Oh. Wow. Thank you. - Mrs. Spinner. First of all, your husband is one lucky man. He's gonna be okay. - What happened to him? - Well, upon reviewing the test results, it appears that your husband's symptoms are those of one who overdosed on blood thinners, which I can't possibly understand. - He's not on blood thinners. - We know. But what's even more disturbing is the medicine was given to him while he was inside the hospital. - Well, how is that possible? - It isn't, in fact, something like this has never happened under my watch. Do you know anyone who may have given him something unintentionally? - No. I mean, our friend gave him a pudding from the nurse's station but that's it. - No, that wouldn't cause anything like this. You husband's out of the woods. But we're gonna continue to monitor him closely to make sure he makes a full recovery. - Thank you, Doctor. - Of course. We'll recheck all prescription refills on the list. It may take a while, but I promise you we'll get to the bottom of this. - Naomi. - Hey. - Trooper. Abby told me I could find you here. - Have you heard from Scarlet this morning? - No, why? - She's not responding to any of my calls or texts. - Hmm, that is not like her. When was the last time you talked to her? - Last night. She told me that you decided to not come from dinner. - Yeah, I changed my mind after talking with her on the way over. - Well, just so you know she seemed kind of hurt about it. - Let's just say, she was already a few glasses of wine in by the time I talked to her. I have lived long enough to know when to let a woman be. Honestly, I kind of suggested that we cool things off for a bit, and she did not want to. - I don't understand why. - Well, she opened up to me about feeling jealous of our closeness. - Yours and mine! We're just friends, we're costars. - Believe me that is what I tried to explain to her. The last thing I'd wanna do is interfere with the show. - Well, I don't know why she wouldn't have just come to me. We're so close. - Not everyone is like you, Naomi. I assumed she felt guilty and embarrassed for feeling that way, which is why I suggested we cool things off. I did call her after to check up on her, but it went to voicemail. I assume she passed out. Like I said she'd already had a few. Are you good to do the show today? - I mean, this would be the first show I've ever done without Scarlet, but we're doing a lot of firsts here lately, right. - Always a pro. - Hey, Jake. You know, what you told me the other day about Trent drinking. - Yeah. - Well, his blood alcohol levels came back, and he was below the legal limit. - Oh. Well, I just assumed it was the beer. Like I say he took off so quick. I didn't have a chance to stop him. I cannot imagine what you are going through. - Yeah, you know what you go without me. I'm gonna check in with the glam squad. It's been a long day. - Okay. - Tony's Bar. - Hi, I was hoping you could help me. I am tying to see your security footage. How would I do that? - The police would have to request it. - Okay, so I report it to police, and they could see the footage. - Exactly. - Got it, thank you. And that's our show. As always thank you for spending your - Mornings with. - Naomi and Jake. - See you tomorrow. - See you. - And we're out. Another great show team. These are your biggest fans. They won the Jake and Naomi trivia contest. - Still nothing from Scarlet? Thanks so much for watching guys. - Well, Jake is super excited to meet you guys. - Yes, thank you all for playing. - How come the arrest isn't on there? - There you are. I've been looking all over for you. - Scarlet's still not here. - Where you off to? - I was just gonna check her place. - Yeah, that's what I thought too I'll meet you there. - Sure. Come on, Scarlet her car's here. It's locked. Scarlet! - Scarlet! - For times like these. Hey, I'm coming in. Scarlet! - Hello! - Scarlet, where are you! - Are you here! She has to be here. - Scarlet! Scarlet. Hello. - Yeah, like I said. - Scar. - Oh, my god, I'll call an ambulance. - It appears she drink too much wine and fell asleep in the tub. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon. We'll continue to look for foul play, and in the meantime, I'm very sorry for your loss. - I should've texted her back. I should've called her. I should've been there for her. - There was nothing you could do. You know what the detective said. It was a accident these things happen. - Not another accident. - Sometimes when things seem a little overwhelming, it's good to take a break. - What. - You know, just... get away from it all. Would you like that? - What are you talking about? - Would you like to go away with me? - Jake, you are not thinking clearly. - I am, I am. - No, you're emotional over Scarlet. - I could never be happy with her. - What, why? - Because I'm in love with you. - Okay, Jake, don't do this, all right. You are upset. You and Scarlet-- - I don't care about Scarlet. - Don't do this. - I care about you. I am the only one who's been there for you, hmm? I'm the only one who's always been there for you, always wanted what's best for you. - You are the only one there for me because everyone in my life is either dead or almost been killed. And it all started to happen after you showed up. - What are you saying? Oh, you think I had something to do with all this? - I don't know what I'm saying... Okay? But those are the facts. I have to go. - Wait. Wait. I'm sorry. Forget what I said. I need you! No, no, no, please, please, please. Don't go, don't go, no. - Abby. - So this woman named Lana Jones has been calling nonstop for Scarlet. Rambling on about how Scarlet's in danger. - I'm gonna need that number from you. Thank you. - Jake did it. He was with her last night. - What are you talking about? - Scarlet messaged me, and said Jake was with her last night. Apparently, she found something of his and wanted to hear my side. It seemed urgent. - Well, what did she find? - I don't know she couldn't talk. Like I said Jake was there. - Well, she told me that he texted her and decided not to come over. - Here. Must have been Jake who texted you after he killed her. - I know that you think, and always thought that he killed Cole, but why Scarlet? - If I'm not mistaken, a strange string of events occurred after he showed up, right? - Yes. - And your cohost dies, and he's suddenly there to fill the position. And you husband. - My husband. - Exactly. - His accident. I guess, I just convinced myself that this was all coincidental. - Nothing with Jake Everett is ever coincidence. Naomi, you're in serious danger. We both are. Come with me to the police. I'm going there right now. No! No! - What, what. - She knows. - Mrs. Spinner. We found traces of Restophin in your husband's blood, which is commonly associated with a date rape drug. - A date rape drug. - That would explain the accident. - And the symptoms that he was having before the accident. - Do you know anyone who would wanna hurt your husband? - Excuse me, Dr. Maslow. They are really getting impatient. - I'll be back as soon as I can. - Hey, beautiful. - I made a mistake bringing Jake back into our lives. - Why would you say that about Jake? - I think, he was behind what happened to you and Robert and Scarlet. Call Lana Jones. Lana, I believe you. I'm on my way to the police station now. You're probably already there. I'll see you soon. See I told you. - Mrs. Spinner, I understand you think Mr. Everett could be responsible for your husband's accident. - Not could be is. - Right, because he lied about helping your husband to his truck. Alright, that hardly implies he attempted to kill him. - Jake was the last person with my husband. Jake ordered the drinks. - There's no footage at the bar that shows Jake drugging your husband. - That's because his back is to the camera. - What about your husband? He still doesn't remember anything today? - Well, no, but the doctor did say it could be possible he'll start to get pieces. - Could. Look this is a very serious accusation. I can't just file charges against a man over your suspicion. We need actual evidence. I need proof. - That's exactly what you told Lana a few years ago. Did Lana Jones come in here earlier? - No, Lana Jones didn't come in today. - What. That can't be. Are you sure? - I'm positive. Look, I'd like to help you. But at the moment my hands are tied, I'm sorry. - Of course, Detective. I'll handle the rest on my own. Oh, my god. - It's not just now. I have always loved you. I knew it from the first time I saw you. You were walking out of the library with your friends. I heard your laugh, and you looked at me. I couldn't believe you were looking at me. I just knew I had to be with you. - Why didn't you ever say anything? - The show was going so well. You and I were working so perfectly together. I couldn't risk it, you know. You always were so interested in the athletes. I was just your friend, which I guess was right because when I finally did muster up the courage to spill my heart out, Cole stepped in, swept you off your feet so easily. I felt so betrayed, so hurt, so angry. - So you killed him. - I couldn't control myself. I had never felt that way. He had to pay. - And then you lied about it. And you let someone else take the blame for you. - I had to get away from you. It was the only way. - Jake, I never meant to hurt you. Obviously, the things I was feeling they were right. - I thought we'd be a team forever. When, I left, I did everything I could to try to just get you out of my head. When Lana tracked me down and I got fired, I knew that was a sign, a sign that I had to get back to the thing that I lost 10 years ago, you. - So then you killed my costar, and then you went after my husband. How do you possibly think that I could love someone that could do something like that? - Because I'm doing this all for you, for us. We are supposed to be together. - That's never gonna happen, okay? It's not gonna happen. Now I'm gonna help you. Okay, I'm gonna help you. - Please don't do that. No, no, no, give me the phone. I said give me the phone! Give me the phone. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. - Come here. - No, no where are we going? - We are going somewhere very special where I know you will realize how you truly feel about me. - No, no Jake, please. - Oh, oh, hey, hey. Don't worry, don't worry, hey, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be our best show yet. - Hello. - Hey, sorry to bother you, but Naomi's not answering. Is she with you? - No. No, I've been trying to reach here too. She left here really upset. She's convinced that Jake is responsible for everything including my accident. - I know, she told me about the Restophin. - He lied, Abby. I remember him helping me get into the truck. - What. - Yes. Call the police right now and help me get out of here. - Still smells the same, doesn't it? You could almost taste those famous chicken nuggets. You sure did love those. Hey, Naomi, look. Look, that's our favorite booth right there. - Jake, whatever you're thinking it's not necessary. - Oh, it is. - No. - It is. I have waited 10 years for this moment. And I have the perfect way to share it. With all our fans and loved ones. Look around. We're gonna livestream the whole thing for everyone to see. You know, that really was a good idea by your former cohost Robert, wasn't it? - What are you talking about? - I may have borrowed his initial ideas, sort of made it my own. He really was pretty sharp. It's a shame what happened to him. No, no, no, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no don't cry. Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, hey. Hey, you're gonna mess up that pretty face. So what do you say? You ready to go live one last time? Okay, here we go. We'll wait till we have enough viewers. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. - Jake. - 8,000, is that enough? 'Cause I want this to go viral, you know. Okay, okay. Hi, welcome to a very special episode of Mornings with Naomi and Jake, in that, it will be our final episode. I'm standing here with your number one favorite, Naomi. Naomi, do you have an opening monologue for us? That's not like you. You're never at the loss for words. - Trent. - Jake's got her. - I know. - What have you done? Why is she crying? I understand your concerns, but it will all be clear in just a moment. - Trent, if you're watching this, you are the love of my life. - This is not about Trent! This is about you and me. Truth is I fell in love with Naomi long before Trent or any of you did. Oh, where are you goin'? - I know where they are. Help me get out of here. - Okay, hold on. - Look at this. For all your Jacomi fans out there from our Campus Cool days where it all started. - Stop, stop, stop! - What? - No. - Tell the world what they all know, what I know. And we'll both run far, far away and live the life we always should have. - Okay, Jake, I do love you. And I was afraid to tell you. I was afraid that you didn't feel the same way. - Do you know how long I've wanted to hear you say that? - I do. And we can be together just please put the gun down. - The way you're looking at me right now that's the same way you were looking at me the last time you betrayed me, the last time you will ever betray me. I'll see you soon. - No, no, no, no! - You okay? Are you? Are you okay? - Hello, yes, this is Trent Spinner. My wife is Naomi Spinner. I know where she's being held captive. She's at Johnny's Diner. - Naomi! - Are you okay? - Are you all right. - Naomi! - Welcome back, world. Okay, we hope you are wide awake right now because we do have people that watch overseas and we cover many time zones, but whatever time you're in it is everyone's favorite time. Time for our favorite most popular segment, and I know you guys look forward to this every single day, so here-- Hi, what are you doing here? - Hey, hey, hey. - Hi, honey. What are you doing here? - Look, we're gonna get back to your segment. But before we do that, I wanna share some news with you that your executive producer Abby just shared with me. As of last week's ratings, you are the most watched daytime personality in the country. Congratulations, baby. - Thank you! - We love you, Naomi. - She's actually very happy about that. Oh my gosh, thank you! That is really huge news. I don't know what to say to that. Thank you. Thank you to everyone who watches the show and streams us around the world, worldwide.
