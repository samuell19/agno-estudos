Is that for real? - Turn on the TV. - Isn't that computer graphics? - What's on TV? - It's like a movie. Today, the ultrafine dust levels reached an all-time high... EMERGENCY ALERT As you can see, some civilians have become ruthlessly violent, viciously attacking the passersby. This phenomenon, which began as a small riot in the Gangbuk District, is spreading rapidly. It seems to have already moved beyond Seoul, reaching a national scale. The government is currently considering raising the emergency level to serious... Help! SEOUL FIRE SERVICES Help me! Hurry! Mom. Mom, where are you? Mom! Get away from me! What the... Jeez!

But what happened at your place is none of my business. - If there's a problem, call the police. - No, wait. You really don't know? You didn't see anything outside? You really don't know anything? - The cops and the people... - Get out! I said, get out! Wait! Just wait. Hold on. Then... Just let me use your bathroom. Then leave as soon as you're done. Thank you. We apologize for the interruption. We are experiencing an unstable network connection. I repeat. Due to the rapid spread of the infection in densely populated areas, the situation in major cities has become uncontrollable. Infected individuals are known to become suddenly violent, and main symptoms of the infection include screaming and bleeding of the eyes. Breaking news just in. Cannibalistic behavior among the infected has been reported. I repeat. Infected individuals' cannibalistic tendencies are spreading. Not only do they attack innocent civilians, but they also exhibit cannibalistic behavior. The KCDC has stated that a bite from an infected individual… In other words, a bite or stab wound... Hey, no. Hold on! Hey. Hey! Jeez. Look. I'm okay. Look, I'm... I'm totally fine! No, please... Just don't kick me out, okay? You said you'd leave after using the bathroom. - Get out. - An hour, then.

WE'RE ON OUR WAY HOME DON'T OPEN THE DOOR TO ANYONE I DON'T THINK WE CAN GO HOME NOW BUT WE'RE SAFE, SO DON'T WORRY JUST DO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ON TV MY SON! YOU MUST SURVIVE! I MUST SURVIVE Gosh, Mom. I should've listened and bought some groceries. We've heard various opinions regarding the current situation. DAY 2 Professor Kim Yeon-jeong, an infectious disease expert, is here. Professor Kim, how would you define their condition? Other than the infected exhibiting physical and behavioral changes, we are not certain of anything. However, it seems that the extreme aggressive tendencies and cannibalistic acts have more to do with the brain. Are you saying this could be a type of mental illness? And not an infectious disease at all? - Your call cannot be - The most likely cause - connected to voicemail. - may be from a virus mutation. However, the aggressive and cannibalistic tendencies that are brought out after being infected seem to be connected to the brain. The mutated virus directly affects our brains, namely the right brain, triggering us to act violently. 201 EUNSOL APARTMENT UNIT 402, 79-3 YANGUI-RO, YEONGDEUNGPO-GU, SEOUL 201 EUNSOL APARTMENT UNIT 402 THERE IS A SURVIVOR, SEND HELP #I_MUST_SURVIVE Hey, it's working. See? What did I tell you? Guys, look! Yes, it works. It's working! - Hey, can you hear me? - Hello? Hey, it's me. It's me here. - Hello? I can't hear you. - It actually works. Dope! - Jeez. - Hello? - What? - Hello? There! No! We received this video from a viewer. As you can see, infected individuals exhibit physical changes along with extremely violent tendencies. It's important to point out that the symptoms don't appear right away. The infected can remain asymptomatic for many minutes… NO SERVICE CALLING DAD Gosh. What? No... Jeez. DISCONNECTED Hey! Hey! You! Hey! You fuckers! Hello, I'm Oh Jun-u. My subscribers probably all know me as Morris62. Well... I've been stuck at home for two days now. "You must survive. You must survive!" That was the last text message I got from my dad. But you see, I don't really know how I'm going to survive. It's a miracle that I'm still alive and recording this right now. Man... Well, anyway... All right. That's it for today. Please subscribe… DAY 7 Forgive me, Dad. I MUST SURVIVE So far it's been discovered that the infection only spreads through the transfer of blood, which occurs via bites and stab wounds. The best thing we can do at the moment is avoid being bitten by the infected. Other than violent and cannibalistic tendencies, the infected do not seem to possess a heightened sense of vision, hearing, or smell. Also, some seem to retain certain behavioral patterns from before they were infected. Like opening a door or a window. Some even remember their jobs and repeat specific behaviors. A wide range of cases are being reported. - Available for anyone, - Those douchebags. - anytime. - A commercial, seriously?

Ms. Kim Elena, a psychologist. Ms. Kim? Today, I'll show you a breathing exercise that can help ease anxiety. THE LAST SUPPER DAY 10 It's me again, Oh Jun-u. I've almost run out of food and water. But I won't leave the house, never. I'd rather starve to death than get bitten and end up like those monsters. They keep showing the same screen on TV every day. They keep saying we should just wait at home, but I have no idea what's going on. My mom rarely watched TV. She liked listening to radio shows online while cleaning. She's even sent her stories to a few radio shows. The radio. Due to frequent emergencies and disasters, they developed an app that uses FM frequencies instead of phone signals to send out emergency broadcasts. You can plug in a 3.5mm audio jack to use as an antenna to receive signals. A headphone jack would be ideal. Shit. Damn it. Why are they all wireless? DAY 15 He's probably playing that game again in his room. Next time, let's go on a family trip with everyone. All right. Hey, why are you standing there like that? Hey, crybaby. Can't you say hi? Son, did you eat? Mom. Mom... ♪ Someday ♪ ♪ However ♪ ♪ Somehow ♪ What? ONE NEW VOICE MESSAGE Son. Stay at home, okay? Don't go outside. VOICE MESSAGE Jun-u.

Let's go do some farming. Jeez. Get off me, fucker! Get off me! Damn. Hello? Hello? Anybody there? Crap. Jeez. Hello? Are you still sleeping? Can you hear me? Hello? Yes, I can hear you. - Hello. - Yes, hello! Hush, lower your voice. Oh, right. Yes. I'm just... I'm just so excited. I mean, this is so cool! You don't have to whisper, you know. Oh, right. - That bag. - What? The... Nutella. - Can you hear me? - Nutella. Hello? Hello? - Don't press the button while I'm talking. - What? The walkie-talkie. Don't press the button when I'm talking. Right, I know. I'm not an idiot. Thanks for the food. Sure. Well, do you like Nutella? It's okay. What? Why did I give it to her, then? I heard that. God, I'm such an idiot. I can still hear you, you know. Thanks for the delicious food. I enjoyed it. I should thank you. For saving me. Thank you so much. I didn't save you. - Sorry? - I said, I didn't save you. You did it because you wanted to live. You wanted to live. That's what's keeping you alive. No, but still... Without you... If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't be here now. I nearly died. No, I was actually going to take my own life. I'm sorry, but can we talk about something else? What? If you don't mind, let's talk about something else. It can be about anything. Do you want some Chapagetti? Did you pour out the water? I only put in a little to begin with. You have to control the amount of water and simmer it down. Simmer it down? If you want to mix it with rice later… Who eats Chapagetti like that? Do you know how to cook instant noodles? Who doesn't know how to cook instant noodles? You, obviously. Why wouldn't she pour out the water? She's weird. Chapagetti tastes the best when it's mixed with Neoguri. Namely, Chapaguri. Right? NEOGURI That's too much food for me. You can't even finish that? Eat up. Yes, I'm going to. Oh my. I wish I could top it off with a drizzle of sesame oil. - You're scared of heights? - What? What's wrong with it? Well, it just doesn't suit you. You cut off someone's hand with an ax, yet you're scared of heights? - I never cut off anyone's hand. - What? Those monsters are not human. Not anymore at least. I am afraid of heights. I fell while climbing a few years ago. Climbing? You mean… going up a cliff in the mountains with bare hands, right? - Like Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible! - Well, I'm not that good. Tom Cruise? You sound ancient. It's raining! Gather some rainwater. Get a bowl. No, a pail! A pail? This isn't rain. Jun-u. Yu-bin, are you okay? They're coming toward my place. They're right in front of my place. They're outside the door now. Which unit? - What? - Your unit number. Are you ready? By the way, are you sure no one's there? Yes, I'm sure. The eighth floor is the only place that's empty. Yu-bin. It's fine… even if the eighth floor isn't empty. Whether we get eaten by them or starve to death, we'll die anyway. Whatever. What? I'm coming. I'm leaving now. But not through the door. What's she doing? Yu-bin. Are you listening? Do you think we can survive this? I'm not sure. But I want to. I really want to live as well. I don't want to be bitten to shreds by those things. And I'd fucking hate to be eaten alive by them. So we have to survive. We'll survive together. All right, then. Hey, Yu-bin. Listen up. I'll get down there first and distract them. That's your cue. One, two. After that... Three! Then you can come down… Who's she, really? Unbelievable. Yu-bin! Let's go! Oh, I see that you're still alive. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Talking casually? You're doing it too. Gosh, I'm exhausted. Eighth floor. Please! This way! Come on! Hurry! Okay. We're good. We're good now. Jeez, you scared me. Guys. You don't need to thank me, but that thing... Could you ask her to put that thing away? Yu-bin. Who are you? Why did you help us? Well... Aren't you the one who pleaded for help? The eighth floor was empty for sure. Goodness. By the way, how did you guys manage to survive? My gosh, I'm impressed. I thought I was the only survivor in this entire building. Right, we also thought we were the only survivors and everyone else ended up like that. Right, of course. But not anymore, right? Right, there are three of us now. By the way, you seem to know a lot. I mean, about them. Right, because I'm still alive. That's all I hear on the news while stuck at home. Right, same here. But why were you guys together? Do you know each other? No. We didn't know each other before this. We met four days ago. I see. You've been here all by yourself? Yes, I guess. Anyway... Aren't you guys thirsty? Have some water. What's wrong? Right, I get it. With everything that's been going on, no wonder you're keeping your guard up. Just drink it. It's fine. Oh, you guys must be hungry. Do you want some food? Yes? I'll have Spam. So? Do you guys like it? Yes. This is awesome. I'm glad. Slow down. Eat slowly. Okay, thank you. There's enough food to last until the rescue team comes, so slow down. - The rescue team? - Seriously? The rescue team? You didn't hear the news? Isn't that why you guys came up here? You really heard that? On the news? I can catch the signal from time to time. You guys really didn't hear it? We're going to make it. Yes, we just need to stay here and hold out for just a little longer. My gosh. By the way, how did you manage to hide out all this time? Hiding is easy when you're older. I hid from my wife when I had to smoke. I guess that helped. Do you have a kid? Nope. But two kids came today. Pardon? Sir. Sir... Hey, Jun-u. Jun-u... Just go to sleep. Good, just like that. Jun-u. My wife... She's starved for days. Without you, who knows how much longer she'd starve? I have no choice. Jun-u! I hope you understand. Understand my ass, you nutjob. Yu-bin! Are you in there? Can you hear me? Answer me, Yu-bin! Is it so wrong that I want to save my wife? It's not like you haven't killed anyone yet. That's right. The fact that we're still alive means that both you and I are the same. Sir. Sir, just a moment. Hold on. Let's talk, okay? All right. All right, then. Jun-u! Jesus, please! Can't you just let us live? Then what about us? Do you think our lives are fucking worthless? Then… just leave the girl and go. I'll spare your life. You can take all the food. Just this once. Stay back! - Just this once! - One more step and I'll kill you! - Just forget about us and leave, please! - Stay back! I'll kill you if you come closer! No. Yu-bin! Yu-bin! Honey. Honey! - Yu-bin! - Honey! It's okay. It's okay, honey. I know you tried your best. It's okay. It's... over... Jun-u. We're still human, you know. And we're together. It's okay now. No. No. Fuck! Hold on. Wait. Hold on a second. What the fuck? Fuck. The roof. The rooftop! - Wait, this thing... - The rooftop! - Fuck! - Hurry! Where are the scissors? Hey, move! Out of the way! Move! I said, move! Come on! Quick! Yu-bin! Jun-u. Jun-u! Go! Just go! Run up there and get the chopper! You have to hurry, okay? No. HYDRANT Fuck! Damn it! Piece of shit apartment! Where's the chopper? There are survivors here. There are survivors here! There are survivors here! There are survivors here! There are survivors here! We're still alive! Over here! There are survivors here! - We're still... - There are survivors here! We're still alive. This is Kilo 717 Bravo Five Point. We've rescued two survivors from Eunsol Complex. This is Kilo 717 Bravo Five Point. We've rescued two survivors from Eunsol Complex. Transporting them to Tango Two, over. MESSAGES It's impossible to know exactly how many people are infected, but the authorities speculate that at least 50,000 are infected across the country. The metropolitan area is hit especially hard because of the little space between apartment units. At the moment, the rescue squad is rescuing survivors from the areas with many apartment complexes by tracing SOS messages posted on social media sites by civilians. Thankfully, each region's internet and wireless networks are being restored, so the SOS messages on social media have been rather effective. Each region's Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters will be pushing a campaign that encourages all survivors to post their current locations on social media. #I_MUST_SURVIVE #I_MUST_SURVIVE #ALIVE "It Was a Pleasure Sharing" ...by Synchronized, Enjoy!
