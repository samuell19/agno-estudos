(happy big band music) (audience clapping) - And now ladies and gentlemen, our show must come to an end. As someone said, all good things must. However, we do hope you've enjoyed our performance. You've been a wonderful audience. It was a pleasure to be here. A round of applause for all those who collaborated with us, your favorite stars, orchestra, and chorus girls. Come with us to Paris. Gay, gay, Paris. (audience clapping) (big band music) (singing in a foreign language) (audience clapping) (singing in a foreign language) (audience clapping) - [Chorus Girl] Back in two and a half hours. - That's right honey, right after the news. - [Antonio] GG, come on, boy. - [Giacomino] You were great, papa. - [Stage Manager] All right, quiet down everybody. The film's about to start. (steam train blowing) (orchestral music) - Tell me how would you get undressed if I wasn't here to help you? I was thinking what would you do without me when I go into the army, huh mama? - My big little man. You've got years to go. Go to your father now. Help him get dressed. (horse whinnying) - Thanks GG. - [Woman With Brown Sweater] Anna, will you fix this please? - Daddy look all right to you now, huh? (Giacomino laughing) Now we go get mama. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - See if she's ready. You ready, Maria? - [Maria] Go ahead with GG. I'll see you at the restaurant in a little while. - All right, but don't be long, honey. It's late and GG's tired and hungry. - Well take him to eat. - That's just what I'm gonna do. See you at the restaurant. (trumpet music) - Here we are. - [Man In Flannel] Hey Pipino, hope we don't get poisoned with these mushrooms. - I'll try some, Pip. Good, very good. Nice and tender like certain girls I know. - That's right, mushrooms are just like girls. If they're not what they oughta be, it's always too late when you find out about it. (diners laughing) (horse whinnying) (gun shooting) - Isn't the soup ready, papa? - Yeah, sir Pipino, bring him the soup. - [Pipino] Right away signor Antonio. - Alfredo, keep and eye on Giacomino. I'll be back in a moment. - All right. - I'll be right back. Eat your soup. - I'll be seeing you. - All right. - Now they'll bring your soup. You must eat it all you understand. It'll do you a lot of good. Now wait. Taste this. How about it? (Giacomino groaning) (Giacomino spitting) (sad music) - Why? Why Maria? Why? (glass shattering) (singing in a foreign language) (diners muttering) - Why isn't mommy here? Doesn't she feel hungry? - Mama's gone. - 'Cause she didn't feel like eating, I bet, so she went to sleep. - No, no GG. - [Giacomino] Where is she then? - She's... - On a plane, she's gone. No kidding, Giacomino. You see your mama, she's so magnificent, such a great big star, her talents were wasted in these small towns. She belongs in the big time. She just had to leave. - Isn't it an awful thing not to say goodbye to people before you leave? - [Alfredo] Well yes. - [Giacomino] But then why didn't she? - Because it happened so unexpectedly. You see this great impresario came all the way from America. - That's right. And she said that she wanted me to kiss you. She'll come back Giacomino. - We'll drink to Maria's success. Now listen my friends, I want to make a toast. Stand up, everybody. Maria has been signed as a big attraction today. And why not drink a toast to her triumph? To our Maria, hip, hip, hip - [Diners] Hooray! - [Antonio] Fill 'er up. - [Bar Customer] First you gotta do your chicken imitation. Come on, come on. - [Antonio] All right. (mimicking chicken) (men laughing) - Watch he'll probably lay an egg for us. - Come on drink up. (mimicking chicken) (men laughing) - Lay an egg! Stop, you're killing me. - [Man In Blue Shirt] Drink your wine. - [Man In Leather Jacket] Here it comes. - [Man In Red And White T-Shirt] That's it. That's it. Oh, it's too big. - [Man In Leather Jacket] Go on take your wine. - That's it on your back. Come on drink up now. - You gotta drink it without using your hands. That's it, up, up, up, up. - That's it, easy. (men laughing) - Hey, now do your dog imitation. (men laughing) - [Romolo] That's enough. - Go on do it. - I said that's enough. You too laughing boy, the house owes you a drink. (wine splashing) - Are you mad at him? - What's a matter Romolo? - Him and his friends. I think you better beat it. What do you think? (Antonio laughing) (bar flies muttering) That's enough, come on. That's all tonight. Why do you bother with those guys? They're laughing at your expense. I don't wanna see anybody do that. Take it easy, you hear. Antonio. - They don't mean any harm. They forget who I am. Do you know who I am? - No. - Tony Sardi. Sardi and Moreno, we were number one. - Antonio, Antonio. - Hey you. - What? - Why do you insist on telling all your personal affairs to these people here? They don't care a damn about your troubles. - [Man With Beard] He's funny. - You laugh, and I'll make you fly outta here. - Now listen, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got a new act now. I do the puppets and the mimicry, you know? I can imitate-- - Listen, give us an imitation of an old drunk whose wife went off with another man, huh. - [Queen] Punchinello How dare you penetrate the private recesses of my throne room in the middle of the night? - [Punchinello] Well your majesty, I felt an urgent need to go, and when you gotta go, you gotta go. - [Queen] How foul, your urgent needs, you dare use my throne room? - [Punchinello] What didn't you understand, your majesty? I meant an urgent need to talk to you. - [Queen] Speak then you, Bonnet. - [Punchinello] I don't want to speak to Count Bonnet. I want to speak to you. - [Queen] Speak, speak, before I lose my patience. - [Punchinello] But I want to help you find them majesty. - [Queen] Buffoon! - [Punchinello] Buffoon, well now it's a threat, you call me a buffoon. - [Queen] Buffoon, buffoon, come to the point. - [Punchinello] But that might hurt. I wouldn't like that. - [Queen] And tell me if you like this. - [Punchinello] Ow, ow, ow, ow. - [Punchinello] This will teach you to make fun of your queen. - [Punchinello] No, no, no, don't! (groaning) (audience clapping) Thank you, thank you very much. Hope to see you all again soon. Goodbye kids. (audience clapping) - Giacomino, that was fabulous. It was a beautiful show. Let me give you some money. - Thanks a lot. - [Little Girl] That was great. - You're as good as your father. When is he coming back? - He's gone on a tour. He'll be back someday soon. (orchestral music) Signora? - What do you want, son? - I'd like a flower. Do those cost much? - 300 Lira. - What do they cost? - 100 Lira. Are you getting it for the Madonna? - Yeah. - Then you can have this, 100 Lira for you. - Thanks very much. Thanks. - Welcome, son. ("Ave Maria") ♪ Ave Maria ♪ - Madonna, Maria, she gave me a caress, did you see? For a moment, it seemed just as if the woman was my mama. Her name is Maria like you. Today's your name day. This is your feast, mama's and yours. So being I don't know where to find her, I came to wish you a happy name day because you are mama to everyone, and you're my mama ever since she's gone. So happy name day, Madonna Maria. If you see my mama someplace, tell her that Giacomino is still wishing she'd come back someday, all right? Her name is Maria Satorelli. I better get going for it's kinda late. You know I got no money, so I couldn't light you a larger candle. So happy name day, huh. ("Ave Maria") At your service, Signor Samuel. - I've been expecting you. There's a bit of work there to do. Old ex photos, they're made of tin covered with silver. - Old ex photos, when I'm through with them, they'll be new again. - How often should I tell you, perhaps you never listen to what I say? They must never look new. I want you to be careful with these ex photos. Don't polish them like you did those candlesticks last time. - Don't they look better when they shine? - Listen, you must never polish articles like these. Now did you hear me, yes or no? An antique object should never have any polish on it to have that antique look. - I'll do all I can to please you. How much will you give me for doing this work, Signor Samuel like last time? - Yeah, they're only 20 pieces. Make it 1,000 Lira for fee. - Each piece, is that what you mean by for fee? - [Samuel] For fee means you'll do the whole job for 1,000 Lira, and that's even too much. And don't keep me waiting this time. - If I finish them in three days, that do? - Yeah, but no more than that. I'll need them on Tuesday to sell to our tourists. - [Giacomino] Don't worry, signor. - Give me a receipt because I want you to learn to do things proper business like. Here write this down. Write received from Samuel, 20 ex photos that I promise not to make shiny. Underneath, you have to put your name. That's it. - But then you oughta give me your signature too. It's business like. (Samuel groaning) (orchestral music) Hey Jimmy, could I have an ice cream cone with lots of vanilla and peach? - Giacomino, no chocolate fudge? - Ah, and chocolate fudge, you're right. - I know it's your favorite. (orchestral music) First we start with vanilla and peach, and then fudge and chocolate. How are you doing with the marionettes? - Not bad. (horn honking) - [Jimmy] Here you are, bye Giacomino. - [Giacomino] Bye. (orchestral music) - You didn't have to hurry back. I told ya. - Want to taste some? - Thanks very much. When we're old, cold things are bad for us, you see. And you Giacomino, instead of eating ice, you should eat lots of meat and beef steaks, you know that? You must eat meat to be strong you know? - Daddy wants me to eat meat, but I don't like it much. I can't eat it because I'm never too hungry. - But you gotta eat to have strength, you see my Giacomino. - I have strength like Samson. - Beef steaks'll make you even stronger than he was. How about a sample now of your Samson's strength? Let's have a little scrum now. I'll bet ya I'll defeat ya. - What do you bet? - Well, we'll bet what you want being that you say you're strong as Samson, why hesitate? Bet all that you can afford. So what'll the wager be? How much? - 200. - 200, huh? All right with me. You ready? Get yourself a good grip now. - Don't worry about my grip. - All right, if you win, I'll give you 500. (grunting) - I win. - I would never have thought. Admit it, son, I wasn't very easy. Don't mess with me son. It was hard, huh? - No, I don't want it. - What's the matter with ya? The victory's yours. You made a wager, and you won, didn't ya? - Yeah, but what if you just let me win then? - What are you talking about? What for? Why should I do that? - But would you swear you didn't make me win before? Swear on the Madonna. - Even on the Madonna, I swear. - All right, that's enough, thanks. Ciao. (speaking in a foreign language) - Excuse me, I didn't mean to swear. He made me swear. You know I simply wanted to help the kid. - [Bar Customer] Here comes Giacomino. - He's so punctual that kid. You could set your watch. He always comes at this time. He works hard the poor kid. - I'll bet you two to one the wrong team's gonna win. I'll see ya. - Hello Paula. - Hello. - [Giacomino] Hello Romolo. - Hello Giacomino, how'd you make out today? - All right, not bad - Excuse me, one loaf, thanks. - Hey Giacomino, you know I came to see your show. You're very good, you know? You're a chip right off the old block. - I peeked during the show. I saw you there. - Ah peephole, bravo. How 'bout drinking this juice for me? - Thanks. - It's vitamin C. Only one I gave him, Giacomino. You know exactly the way I promised. But then these others came in here and continued to fill up his glass. At this point I've noticed that after he drinks up the first glass, it completely knocks him out. - [Giacomino] Here, I'll pay you for his drink. - Right, thanks. (church bells ringing) - Papa, papa? (Antonio groaning) Papa, come on. (church bells ringing) Let's go, papa. Come on, wake up. - No, go away. Ah, GG. (laughing) Oh. - [Giacomino] Let's go home, papa. - No, no, no, no, you go, I'll stay here. You go, go, go. - Oh come on, papa. It's late, you know? (church bells ringing) - Let me go and help him. - Nah, leave him alone. Giacomino can manage. You mind your own affairs. (church bells ringing) - Let me. Come on. Ciao Romolo, Ciao Paula. - [Romolo] Ciao. - [Paula] Ciao. - [Romolo] Ciao. - Come on. (church bells ringing) - Everyday, the same old story. Too bad for that little kid, you know? Sooner or later, I'm gonna adopt that kid. A fine son, he'd make. - Hey Romolo, to adopt a child, they say you gotta first be properly married. - [Man In Green Jacket] And how 'bout the kid's father. Are you gonna adopt him too? - And adopt 200 or 300 bottles of burgundy. - [Barfly] Yeah, that way you'll have father, son, and the holy spirit. - Amen. Mind your own business, you drunken, good for nothing, nosybodies, get outta here. - Hey, I guess the bottles got to you. - Yeah, look at the one who's talking. You're drunker than a drunken sailor. - [Man In Gray Jacket] Drunken what? - Blah, blah, blah, you make me sick, the whole bunch of you. - Here. You know papa, tonight we're having a couple beef steaks. - Beef steaks, huh? - Well everyone says you gotta eat it to make you good and strong. - That's right, GG, that's right. - Let's go, papa. (orchestral music) - [Antonio] Here we are. All right. (orchestral music) - Hold this, papa. - All right, open her up. (orchestral music) GG, match. - Sure. (orchestral music) (Antonio coughing) What's the matter? - Nothing, nothing, nothing. I'll help you get dinner. (orchestral music) (silverware clanging) I got it. Hey look, I think I'll go get freshened up a little bit. - Go on, take your time. Tonight dinner's kinda complicated. (orchestral music) - Oh, good, good. No, no, meat's for you. Meat, I'll have cheese and bread. - [Giacomino] No papa, we'll split it. It's big enough for two. - A little piece. Give me that one. No, no, no, this one, this one. - There. - Thank you. - Boy, it smells good. I went-- - Don't you ever speak with your mouth full. - I know but-- - You chew, chew, chew, chew. When you've swallowed, you can talk. - I went to give our good wishes to mama. - What? - Being it's the Feast of Maria, I thought I'd visit the Madonna and light a candle for mama. - Eat your food. You know I used to buy her beautiful presents on her name day. - And did she ever give you any presents for yours? - Of course, of course. (sad music) (grunting) (coughing) I want wine. You hear me? I want wine now! - But in the house we don't keep wine. Papa, you gave me orders not to. - Don't you ever speak to me that way, young man. I'm your father. - Yes papa. - I'm your... (stuttering) - Papa. Papa? - Wine. - If you want to go to the bar. - Right, I've gotta get outta here. Thank you, GG. You're a man. And I'm, I'm just a... - Papa, don't come home too late please. - [Antonio] No. - 12 and nine are 21. That's what I collected with the marionettes. And over there on the square I won 500 from the old man. Madonna Maria, thanks 'cause you helped me to make a whole lot today. Did you hear that kid at our puppet show when you hit me over the head? Yeah, I'll give it all you've got? You like that eh? And you Punchinello when you made the fat king trip. He fell like a big salami. And what a bad king you are. Oh, you've got a nice scratch there on your nose. We better patch it up right away. Starting tomorrow, we're beginning a new funny play. I'll take off your crown and put on a large sheriff's hat 'cause you're a good cowboy. You'll be the fella that beats up everybody same as in the cinema. - [Sheriff] And if you don't quit your shooting around, you'll find yourself six feet under the ground. - [Terrible Bill] Under the ground, don't forget you're talking to Terrible Bill who's faster than any gunman that's out to kill. - [Sheriff] And I'm Sheriff Deathbar, I represent the law. - Take it easy there sheriff. You forget I've been nick named prohibited punch, prohibited pistol, and so on prohibited. And now I prohibit your fat, big bragging month. (grunting) - [Terrible Bill] Look out, I warn you. (Antonio singing) - Hello Antonio, drink with us. - Come on, Anto. - There's plenty for you. - Yeah, we got plenty of it, all the wine you can drink. - And at the end of the show, we present none other than the great Tony Sardi. (bar customers cheering) Tony Sardi is gonna dance the old can-can for us. - Yeah, can-can. (bar customers cheering) (bar customers laughing) (orchestral music) - Madonna Maria, please help me. Help me, won't you please? (groaning) (orchestral music) - [Bystander] What's the matter, kid? You feel sick? Give me a hand somebody. - [Woman In crowd] What is it? - [Bystander] I don't know he just fell over. - I think he's fainted. - He just (muttering) son. - Somebody go and call a doctor, would you? - He won't come to. Come on, anybody ring up for an ambulance. - [Man On Left] She's right, maybe it's something serious. - I just sent my brother to call the hospital. Don't worry, ambulance'll be here in a minute. - [Bystander] I know who this kid is. He runs the puppet show up at the park. - This is Maria, don't you remember? Hello darling, you morbid old jackass. Don't be jealous of that fellow. - [Antonio] Stop it, stop it. - [Man With Scarf] I don't love him. I don't love anybody. And don't ask me to come back to you 'cause I want to be free, free. I'd rather become a street walker. Goodbye darling, kiss me. (bar customers clapping) - Go ahead, kiss her, kiss her. - Leave me alone. - [Man In Red And White T-Shirt] Ain't you gonna play? Come on we'd like to finish this game. (bar customers laughing) - You've had enough fun for tonight. - Hey what do you want? (fist smacking) - Oh what are ya, out of your mind or somethin'? (Antonio grunting) - Come on Antonio, you're better alone. - Hey Romolo, we're just kidding. - It's a hell of a way to do it. Bunch of skunks the lot of ya. - It's all in fun. - Bunch of lousy skunks. You're inhuman. - Transfusion, hurray up. - [Nurse] Yes, doctor. - They advise the family? - I imagine they have. Do you know if they've been called nurse? - [Nurse On Right] I don't know. - What do we do if he has no parents? - [Dr. Novelli] We'll go ahead with the transfusion. - I have a papa, you know? And a mama. - Why sure, son. We're having them notified, don't worry about it. It won't be long. They'll be here, Giacomo. - Giacomino. Giacomo, I'll be called as an adult. - The boy will have to stay here. Tell them in the office they've got to find room. This is an urgent case, understand? - [Nurse On Right] I understand, doctor. - [Dr. Novelli] It's impossible here. Let's try the next floor. - I doubt if it's any better there, doctor. - Do you know little Giacomino's father? - He's right there. - Thanks. Say are you the father of Giacomino, the boy who runs the puppet show? - Yeah. - He must've felt sick. He fainted in the street. We had to take him to the hospital in an ambulance. - Ambulance, what? - He's at San Filippo's hospital. - San Filippo's. My God. My God. - Dr. Monforte? Excuse me doctor, but there's absolutely no more room in any of the wards. We may put the little boy in the library if it's all right. What do you think? - It's ridiculous. It's intolerable. They talk their heads off about hospital reform, and in the meantime, we're forced to pack the patients in the corridors like sardines. If things go on like this, we shall soon be asking them to bring their own beds. All right, we'll put the boy in the library. Tell Sister Maria, I'll be right up. - Very well, Dr. Monforte. - Dr. Novelli, I'd like a word with you if you don't mind. - Yes, of course. - I would like to look at Giacomino's chart again. - Very well, but I'm afraid the boy's condition remains exactly as I indicated. - Unbelievable not to realize the boy was anemic and let this condition deteriorate to this point. - The boy lives with his father they told me. The man's an alcoholic. Please Dr. Monforte. (water splashing) - Signora where is Punchinello? He went on a trip to the moon. To the moon? But didn't he tell anyone he was leaving? He told no one. He was very tired, so he decided to take a long rest. On the moon? Certainly, it's very peaceful there. And when will he return? Who can tell? He may find it so pleasant that he'll never return. Never? Never. Thank you, moon. Thank you, very much for your nice visit. Would you please help me to get well fast? - Very serious. His incredible stamina was due to his youth. The young are stubborn fighters. Won't you sit down? - No. No, no, no, no. Go on. - In other words, the child refused to let himself become ill and used up all his energy fighting it. Inadequate feeding leading to acute malnutrition has produced disastrous organic weaknesses which we can no longer control. - Well why didn't I see it? - Yes, you should've remembered that you were a man, and he is only a child. - So what's gonna happen to him? - We'll do everything we can. We are doing everything we can. But... - He's gonna die? Oh, oh God no. Oh, God no. Oh God, not him. Not him. Not him. Not him. (crying) - Your boy is resting now. Why don't you come back tomorrow? Come. (buzzer buzzing) The gentleman is leaving. Please show him out. - Signor, please leave. - Leave me alone! - Tomorrow, you will see your son. - It's closing time. Well, what do you say? I'm telling you, you gotta go. I have to close. - (stuttering) I'm ready. - Come on, come on, we gotta finish here. - All right, (mumbling) all right. (glasses clattering) I never. - Yeah, yeah. - [Antonio] Romolo! Romolo, open up. - Take it easy. - It's me, Antonio. - You're waking up the neighborhood. Anto-- - Let me in Romolo, please. - I can't let you in, Anto. I gotta close. - I'm not allowed to serve - Five minutes, Romolo please. - drinks at this hour. - Come on, just for five minutes. - No, I'm not allowed to serve any drinks. It's late to get a thing. - I don't want anything to drink. Just please let me in. - But I'll be fined because of you. - Please. Please, please. (drunk mumbling) - Come on, hurry up then. Inside, come on. - [Antonio] Thanks. - I never. - You mustn't give up. Be a man after all. Have a bit of faith, Anto. (drunk yelling) - Hey bud, that's all. Stop yelling. (drunk grunting) I thought I told ya, bud, cut the yelling! (drunk coughing) - What's the matter? Don't you appreciate good music, huh? - Look you have to have faith, Anto. - I'll sing whenever I feel like it, you hear? (mumbling) They're my vocal cords. It's a free country. - Look, go home. - Go where? (laughing) - Give that guy there a break. He came from the hospital. His little boy is dying. - [Drunk] What? - [Antonio] No. - Here drink it, come on. Go ahead, go. What's this? - No. - What's the matter? Here. You're spilling it. Come. Here. Here's good luck. Come on. Drink it. - Yeah well, I'll drink it, my friend. It's as if you gave the drink to him. Are you glad now? - [Policeman] Who's in there? - [Romolo] It's all right, it's me. I know it's late, Rocco. - It's kind of unusual for you, ain't it? For a minute I thought burglars-- - No, it's because Antonio's feeling bad. His son was taken to the hospital. - His kid's sick, Giacomino? - Yeah. Can I offer you anything? - Thanks, glass of wine. I'll be back right away. - Afraid they'll steal your bike? What a cop. - (laughing) Don't make me laugh. Anybody who steals this bike couldn't sell it for a pack of cigarettes. No, it's only 'cause I'm on duty if anyone sees it. You know I'm not allowed to touch anything. Hello Antonio. - This is the first chance in 20 years that I can choose my own company. I've been away. (laughing) That's the nickname they gave me, 20 Years in the country club that is. They'd say, "Hi 20." I drank one glass for each year, you see. - (laughing) You sure did. (laughing) Tell me is Giacomino pretty bad? Buck up, Giacomino'll be out of the hospital and back to his marionettes in no time. In two weeks, two months, that's how it is. Kids have a way of getting over an illness overnight. A few days, your boy'll get well again, you'll see, yeah. (20 Years singing) - What's that? Oh. I live here. - What? - I live here! - Yeah. Here? - No, down here, down here. - Got a match? Let's see. - Wait a minute. I haven't got a match. I haven't got a match. Well it's been nice knowing ya. Good luck to ya. - Good luck! - Yeah. - Good luck! - Yeah. Well goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Say, where you gonna stay tonight? You got any place to sleep? - Huh? - Have you got any place to sleep? - I don't know. I don't know anybody here. I don't know anybody. - Well why don't you sleep in here with me? I've got an extra... - What? - Come on, come on, come on. - You ever been in the slammer? It's a broadening experience, you know? Yeah, here's what the doctor ordered. Beddy-bye, beddy-bye. (bed squeaking) - No. No, no, no, no. No, no. My bed. My bed, please. Sleep. - That one? - Yeah, this'll be comfortable for ya. Please. Sleep. - Someone's been sleeping in papa bear's bed. - Huh, um hmm. That's it, sleep. (20 Years grumbling) (20 Years coughing) - Hello Giacomino. Do you know my name? - Yes, I know. - I'm Sister Maria. Look how nice, beautiful pajamas I brought you. We'll put them on now. (pliers tapping) (tin shaking) (orchestral music) - Excuse me, are you Signor Satorelli? - Yes. - You may go in. Easy now, I'll show you where to go. (Antonio coughing) - Shush. It's my blood pressure that he's measuring. - Shush, a few more seconds, Giacomino. - Uh huh, papa. - [Dr. Monforte] Giacomino. - He's finished. (orchestral music) - My son, my son, GG. My little man, GG, my little GG. (orchestral music) - You go on to the next ward. Come, come, don't smother him. - See what a mess I got in, papa. Silly, isn't it? - Remember now, you promised. - Sure, I've got to behave. - And obey Sister Maria. - And obey Sister Maria. She's Sister Maria. - You feel better GG, huh? He is better now, isn't he? - Of course, yes. (Antonio crying) - But papa, you have to make believe you're a marionette and keep your tear vases from running. Will you promise me you'll do that, papa huh? - And now, young man, I'm going to steal your father for a moment. Please come with me. - All right. - But you know my papa's first name isn't really Antonio. It's Burns. - I thought you told me his name was Antonio. - No, his name is Burns 'cause he returns. - (laughing) Come. - And now I'm giving you your injection, huh. - Where in the arm or in the back, Sister? - In the rear, in the rear, so you won't even see it. - Will you please? - You won't hurt me, will ya? - No, I don't think so. - I'm afraid, no, I don't want it. I don't want it, no! - I have to give it to you. Remember your promise? And if you're a good boy, I'll give you a nice comic book to read. Come now. - All right, give me the injection. - What would you like to read? - Maybe Diabolic. (grunting) - Well what about you for the love of God? Why can't you help him? Why? - All we can do is try to make him happy for the time that's left. Your son is an extraordinary child, you know? It's as if the pain, the disease itself had hardly touched him. You should be proud of that boy. He shines. The goodness shines out of him. He's the purest creature I've ever met. Something happened last night that Sister Maria told me about. - Sister, I have a secret I'd like to tell you. - A secret, you do? - Yes. - Fine, but try not to talk too much. - In the kitchen in my house, I've got a treasure, you know? - No, I don't know. - Yeah, and I want you to know it's hidden in an old box of cookies. - And what is it? What is this hidden treasure? - What'll you bet, Sister Maria, you'll never guess. - (laughing) Your toys , what else? - My saving's a treasure. It's worth as much as a pirate's or maybe more. - You mean the money that you saved? - I worked hard for it though. - But why? Only grownups should work, not children. (orchestral music) That's not right. - I was pretty scared my papa would die from one minute to the next you see. - And for that reason, you worked? - Well I thought that if it happened, I decided that when he goes to see God that he should go with all the honors with a beautiful suit and a new shirt and tie and lots of flowers. - And the money you saved was to get your daddy a suit? - Yes, that's right. Oh and with the treasure I saved, I was gonna buy my father also a new pair of nice suede shoes. He always liked suede shoes. And when God opens the door and sees him, he's sure to say to all his angles what a nice, handsome man he's got a good looking papa that Giacomino. - There's another dream he has more important than that. You know what I mean. - His mother. - It's his greatest wish. If you could somehow manage-- - No, no, no, no, I don't even know where she is. I have no idea. - I'd try to find her for him. - I don't know where to begin. I mean I wouldn't know where to start. - Start searching just the same. - All right. May I say goodbye to him first? - Of course, of course. But let him see you smiling. - Where's my son? - I'm here, papa. I'm doing something. Guess what. (Sister Maria laughing) - He insists on doing everything my by himself all alone. Just a minute, dear. There we are. Now then, good. - Listen papa, you know I'm not scared, but you know... - Well I'll leave you alone. Giacomino, if there's anything you want, press this button. All right. - Thank you. Thank you, Sister. Well, well GG, you were saying, but what? - Well papa, I just wanted to, well you know. - Your mommy? - Yeah, I just put one candle to Madonna Maria, but oh if you could try to bring her others. - GG, we'll do everything we can to bring her back. - You'll try to find her, really? - I promise. - And there's another thing. - [Antonio] What? - But I don't know if I lost it, papa. - [Antonio] What GG? - My cart with the marionettes. - Oh yeah, they brought it back. It's in our courtyard now. - Papa, please I want you to look after the marionettes. Boy, ah gee papa, I've been thinking of the (speaking in a foreign language) in the park who'll go crazy for the theater. You should see. Would you do the marionette show? - Who me? No. - [Giacomino] Please papa. - All right. - Oh thanks papa, you'll be marvelous. You'll be great with the marionettes in the park. - But not as good as you, but I'll try. (crying) - Please papa, I don't want to see you suffering. You mustn't cry, papa. Please. - Me cry? You kidding? - I want to sleep. - Yeah, sleep. (sad music) 20 Years? 20 Years? (glass shattering) (dishware clattering) - They're ready, Signor Samuel. My father will be in later to deliver them. 1,000 Lira for a fee like we agreed. (orderly groaning) Huh, shinny? No, not very, like you said. He'll bring them all. Thanks, thanks a lot. - I hope you finished today, Signor Giacomino. - [Giacomino] Thank you very much. - These business transactions-- - [Giacomino] Oh I'm finished now. - Oh I'm so pleased. - Are you taking me downstairs. - That's right. You have to get analyzed. - We going in the elevator. - Yes, your highness. Right away your highness. You got your reading material, highness? And where did you get that? - Sister Maria. - Oh good Lord, Sister Maria, Diabolic. Oh there's no more religion today. - Romolo! Romolo. - [Romolo] What is it? - That ex con who was here last night, have you seen him today? - He hasn't been here. - Bastard. - What is it, Anto? - Oh that dirty bastard. - Anto, what's he done to you? - My son, my son saved money for me. Here look. And that bastard, see for dad, and that bastard stole it. - Why they let those rotten robbers out of jail? They should let 'em stay there and rot. Imagine robbing a little kid. Yeah, but leave it to me. I'll find the rat. - No, no, my son's dying, and he wants to see his mother. And I've gotta find her. - Wait a second. How are you fixed for cash, Anto? Just a minute. - Huh? - Just a minute I said. - No, wait, don't. - Yes, here. Here take it. Giacomino gets out of the hospital, you'll give it back to me, I know. Go on, find your wife, Maria, go on. Find your wife, I said. Go on, find her! (table banging) - What were you saying, dear? - That she was very pretty. I remember her pretty like the Madonna. How happy we used to be then with mommy. - Speak to me about your marionettes. They tell me your shows are something great. - Yes, and it's fun 'cause I do all the voices, but I learned from papa. And mommy had plenty of time that's why she toured so much around the world. - Let me hear the bold voice of the king. - Why is Punchinello sitting on the royal chair? (Sister Maria laughing) - And now the voice of Punchinello? - Yes. - How 'bout you? - What do you mean? - I would like to know if you're really bald headed. - Now why should you think I'm bald headed? - Well I was told once that all nuns were bald headed, but I don't think so. (Sister Maria laughing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Yeah, yeah I know her. - You do? - [Woman In Black Blouse] You like her, huh? - You know where she lives? Do you know where she lives? - Sure, I know. I'll give you her address. Old friends, huh? - Yeah, old friends. - [Woman In Black Blouse] Where did I put that address? I'll find it in a minute. - She went up just this minute. She isn't up in her room yet. - You're gonna call her now! - Don't yell! Get out of here! - I said call her! Call her. Call her! - She doesn't want to be disturbed. - Let it ring. Let it ring. - Now wait a minute. - Let it ring - You can't order me around - do you hear me? - Like a kid. You understand, sir? - Shut up. - Oh so sorry signorina. Sorry if I disturbed you. There's an individual here who wants to see, a man. - [Maria] Tell him to wait. - But he won't wait, he wants to speak-- - [Maria] I said tell him that I can't. - Maria, wait a minute. - [Maria] Who is this? - Maria? - I'm sorry I can't. - Wait a minute, listen I... (phone hanging up) What's her room number? - Now look, I won't tell you. - I'm gonna go up there and bang on every one of those doors until I find her. Do you understand? - Yeah, yeah, you bang on the doors. I'm going to the police, you hear? - Listen to me, my son is dying. He wants to see his mother, that woman up there. He's gonna see her, you understand? - But why didn't you tell me that right away? You should've, by God, you know I'm sorry. Second floor, room 27. - [Antonio] Maria? (door knocking) Open the door. Open the door, or I'll knock it down. - Who is this? What the heck? Hey, who the hell are you? - [Antonio] Maria, tell him who I am. - [Maria's John] I don't care if you're the president. I'll knock your block off. - [Antonio] Maria. - [Maria] Leave him alone. He's my husband. - If you don't want her living this life, keep her locked up at home. How should I know she's married after all? I paid her in advance too. - [Antonio] Here, take what you want and get out. - [Maria's John] I'll take only what I paid for the room. - Get out! Maria, your son is dying, and he wants to see you. Maria, he's dying, and he wants to see you right now. - I don't believe you, no. - Maria, for God's sake, Maria. - [Maria] He's not dying. - He is, and he wants to see you right now. You've got to come, Maria. You've got to come. - I don't believe you. - Please Maria. - I don't believe you. - Maria please. - You're lying. - Listen to me. - You're telling me this lie, this horrible thing to punish me, to take me away. - How could you think I could lie about such a thing, Maria? - Leave me alone, let me go! - Maria, listen to me. - You're trying to punish me, - Listen to me. - Antonio, you're trying - to punish me. - Your son is dying, and he wants to see you now, please. - [Maria] Oh God, it's not (crying) true. - That's all he wants in this world. - No! He wants to see you, and he's going to see you now. - [Maria] Oh God, no! - There's a taxi waiting downstairs. We haven't got much time. Come on. Please, come on. - It's true. - Please. No Maria, there's no hope. At least, that's what the doctors say. That's why I had to find you right away. - And so you knew I wound up this way. - Oh, people talk. They tried to tell me, but I didn't want to believe them. You see I'm a coward, Maria. Because of it, GG's paying the price. (Maria crying) You know he's a great boy, a great boy. When you left, I fell apart. GG was the only thing that kept me going. He even came into the act with me. Then I started to drink. Nobody would hire me, but he, he kept going. He started his own puppet show, and it's great. Or was. It was. - Antonio, I wanted often, I wanted to return. I was afraid you might've been informed of the life I was leading, and I thought I didn't want him to know. - [Antonio] Maria, right now he wants to see you more than anything else in the world. - [Maria] But how can I let him see me like this? - Well I told him you were a famous actress now, and you were touring the world. - Antonio, Antonio, I won't let him see me. For the love of God, not this way. I'm too ashamed to. Let me go and change first. - [Antonio] We haven't got time. - [Maria] Don't let him see me like this. - No, we don't have time. - Please Antonio, I won't take long, I beg you. Listen driver, on the way to the hospital, we're stopping somewhere else for a moment. I'll tell you where it is when we're near there. It isn't very far. - [Taxi Driver] Yes signora. - Thanks. (Giacomino groaning) - Drink your soup. Making faces. You have to drink it. It's very good for you. - It's very good for me, but I don't like this soup very much. - Well listen, if you drink your soup, I'll let you have a look at what a nun wears under her cap. - You'll take off that sheet you go on? I can have a look? - Yes, but it's a secret 'cause we're not supposed to uncover our heads. It must remain just between you and me. - Oh, I won't tell a soul if you don't want me to. - All right, go ahead, you may tell whoever you like to as long as they're your friends. (laughing) - Sister Maria, you've got hair on top of your head. - I have, haven't I? - You have lots of hair. - GG. (sad orchestral music) (mirror rattling) (sad orchestral music) - I thought this is some kind of a nut. Mind if I tell you something? You've got a great, big heart. (sad orchestral music) - Thanks for picking me up at the station. - All right, what do I owe you? - Nothing. - Why? - 'Cause it's my gift for your son from me. - Thank you. (speaking in a foreign language) - You be a good boy now and promise me you won't get overexcited. - But I am a good boy. I mean I try to be. Ma, ma, mama. Mama! - Oh GG. (orchestral music) My baby. - My mommy. (orchestral music) Mommy, at last you came back. (orchestral music) - [Romolo] Go on. - Antonio. I took the money. I mean I guess I couldn't resist the temptation. But I didn't touch a penny of it. I can't steal from a child. (sniffing) The money's here at the bar. I was gonna leave it for ya with the guy who runs the place. He wouldn't let me. He wanted me to tell ya myself. Thank you. (glasses clinking) - Better get on over there. - Come on, hurry up. It's getting late. They might not even let us in at the hospital. - Hey, what's going on? I wanted a cup of coffee. - I'm sorry I'm closing now. - What, this early? - The bar is mine. When I close up is my business. You want a cup of coffee, go to the bar across the street. Tell 'em I'll pay for it. Don't worry I'll pay for it. Go on, see you tomorrow. - Hurray up. - Hey, what is it? What's going on? - 20 Years brought back Giacomino's money, so we're all going to the hospital now to bring it to him. - All of you are going to the hospital? - That's right? - [Rocco] Is the kid any better? - He won't pull through. - Then I'll go over there with you. - [Romolo] The kid'll like that. You wanna go? - Yeah. - Come on, let's go. - All right. - All right. - [Maria] Drink it, dear. (Giacomino coughing) - Listen papa. - Yes GG, yes? - Can you do a favor for me, huh? - Certainly. - I would like you to go over to the antique dealer, Signor Samuel. I polished 20 ex photos for him. He promised he'd pay me 1,000 Lira. Will you deliver them? They're under my bed at home. - Yes, of course I'll take care of it. - Ah, by the church there's a real old man that watches my cart for me. You should tell him I know he told me a lie because I've been very sick. I have no strength to beat anyone. He'll know what I mean. - Everything ready? - Yes, doctor. - Well young man, can you spare me a moment now? - Very well. What is it you hear in there, doctor? - Huh? - In that thing there, I'd like to know what you hear. I'm pretty curious about these things. - I've already told you. You can't hear it by yourself, but what another person hears is the heart. Your heart in this case. - I don't remember, what is it called, stereo? - Stethoscope. Shush. - It's pretty difficult to say. - Let's have a little talk. Just for awhile, we won't be long, signora. (sad music) Don't cry, signora. - But what him, why? Why him, not me? Why couldn't it have been me? - No, you shouldn't say such a thing, signora. You shouldn't say such things. - Please, it's too much. - These are the moments Giacomino needs you more than you know, signora. (Maria crying) Look these moments are worth a whole lifetime. - [Romolo] I know it's late. - Oh please, silence. - [Romolo] We came to visit Giacomino Satorelli. - Oh at this hour, you're not permitted to visit anybody. - What's all this fuss? You're not allowed to be in here. You're not supposed to. Quiet, this is a hospital. - We came all the way over here, but it's urgent for God's sake. - Wait, I'll explain everything. Take it easy now. Quiet down! Have a little consideration. We came here hoping to see Giacomino. - And to speak to Antonio. - [Paula] We're old friends. - It's a surprise. Let us go up. - It's against the rules, don't you understand? Without permission, it's no use. - Sister, I must see Giacomino. It's urgent, urgent. - One minute, I'll call the doctor in the ward then. Um doctor, please excuse me. There's someone here asking us if we can let him go now to speak to that bambino, little Giacomo Sartorelli. He says it's urgent. - Tell him to tell Antonio it's me, 20 Years. - He says to tell Giacomino's father it's 20 Years. Yes well, I guess that's what he calls him. Very well. Go upstairs, second floor, and when you come out of the elevator, turn left. It's the room marked library. But you alone though. - [Bar Customer] Hey what about us? We want to go too. - No please, where are you going? You can't. The doctors said... - It's my treasure there. - I brought it because your father asked me to. - [Antonio] That's right, GG. I thought you'd be pleased. - Gee, but who are you? - Oh, a friend. - Yes GG, a friend. He's been away a long time, but now he's back. - This was my secret treasure. Well I'm glad you discovered it. I really don't mind now. Sister, do you? - No, no. I'm really surprised. You're richer than I thought. - The money I got at the marionette shows, but I'm not really rish like you think. - You wanna bet, you have around more than 20 I'll bet. - I'll tell you what we'll put it over here, so you can keep an eye on it, huh? - This way nobody could steal it. - [Giacomino] Isn't nice to have so many friends? - All of you, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. - Forgive me. Forgive me for everything. You're all right. - Isn't it marvelous, how happy he looks? Take them, we offer them to you with pleasure, signora. - [Maria] Thank you. - Oh by the way, what's your name? - Giovanni, but everyone calls me 20 Years. (laughing) - But just your best friends. You're much older than that. - Oh well. Oh, may I? Thank you. (singing) (men laughing) (group clapping) - Bravo! (group clapping) - Here. - Your dancing reminded me of my marionettes. You were very good. You oughta be in the circus. You'd be great, you know? - That's where I learned it, sure, in a circus. - Used to be nice, the circus. - Uh huh, darling. - [Giacomino] Gee, I'd love to go to the circus again. - Of course! That's a fantastic idea. - Say, he's right. That idea seems great to me. Yeah, the circus is three blocks away. Let's take Giacomino to the circus right now. - [Bar Customer] That'd be real treat for the kid. - [Bar Customer] Come on, he could get a kick out of it. - I'm supposed to be on duty. With this excuse, I'll get fired. It'll only be for the night. I stayed home with a bad tooth. (men laughing) - Gee, oh let me go, Sister Maria. - No, my dear, I can't. Are you finished dancing now? Do you intend to go on? - Mama, Sister Maria, why don't you let me go to the circus? It's not very far. He said so. - No, for now, it's impossible. - [Giacomino] But why? - Because you're too weak now, darling. As soon as you're well enough we'll take you I promise. But now it's just impossible, my darling. - [Giacomino] Mommy, please. - You mean you can't allow him to be moved? - No, it's simply impossible, and it's not up to me. - But for him it might be the right thing to do. Deep in your heart can you really say no? - [Sister Maria] Well I'd be taking a terrible responsibility. Very well, we'll get Giacomino dressed. Most of you, please wait outside, so there won't be any confusion. - [Nurse] All right, let's go out quietly please. - So long Giacomino. See you at the circus. - [Nurse] Remember there are many sick people in the hospital. Quiet please, quiet. (orchestral music) - [Rocco] What's in that I wonder. - I don't know. (orchestral music) (group muttering) - See the kid's eyes when he saw the father? - Who are all these people? What do they want? - [Dr. Novelli] I have no idea. - What are you doing here? - We're here to visit Giacomino, doctor. - [Giacomino] Dr. Monforte, we're all going to the circus. - I don't know what to say except I couldn't say no. - [Dr. Monforte] His condition. - I know, but I couldn't deny the child this great joy. - But we couldn't possibly let him go. It's madness. - But he's so happy and so full of life tonight, and he's not the only one. - [Giacomino] Doctor, will you come to the circus too? - Listen Giacomino. - Oh thanks, doctor. We'll have fun over at the circus, really. - All right, they'll say I must've been out of my mind, but I'll explain to the others. And you? - I'll explain it all to Jesus. I know he'll understand me. - Well, shall we go? - Signores please, what are you doing? It's late, the people have left. The next show is tomorrow. Come tomorrow night then. What's your name? - Giacomino. - Giacomino? - Do me a favor please. I'd love to see your lions and elephants. - You bet. You bet! Go and be seated, friends. Just be seated for the time being. (sad music) (big band music) (audience clapping) (big band music) Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present to you the spectacular circus from America. The show begins with the great parade. (big band music) Giacomino, I hope you like it. (audience clapping) (big band music) - Giacomino, glad to know you, Giacomino, ciao. - [Giacomino] Ciao. (big band music) (horse whinnying) (audience clapping) (big band music) (horses whinnying) (big band music) (lion roaring) (big band music) (lion roaring) (audience clapping) (big band music) (lion roaring) (big band music) (elephants trumpeting) (big band music) (elephants trumpeting) (whip cracking) (big band music) (elephants trumpeting) (big band music) (elephants trumpeting) (audience clapping) (whip cracking) (big band music) (audience clapping) (whip cracking) (elephants trumpeting) (sad music) - Are you happy, Giacomino? - You know my name? - Of course, I know all about you. - Say, and you know the names of my papa and my mama? - Oh yes. - But who are you? - I'm just a man who sells balloons. - [Giacomino] But how come you know all about me? - Oh balloon sellers know everything about everybody. - No, it's impossible. - [Balloon Vendor] They do, I assure you, Giacomino. - But how come? - Well I'll tell you it's like this. Sometimes, pretty often in fact, the balloons slip out of the children's hands and then away they go sailing up into the sky till they reach the Lord up in heaven. And there they tell him everything that happens here on earth. - But balloons don't speak though. - Oh yes, they do. Not as you or I, their voices are silent, and the only one who understands them in the Lord. He's the only one who can talk to them, and he talks to the about all the things in the universe. - But aren't they-- - [Balloon Vendor] I told you the Lord's the only one who knows their language. - How come you know it then? - Oh I, I just know it. - But if you can't speak their language? - [Balloon Vendor] I can understand them just the same. - But only the Lord can possibly understand them you said. Then how come that you can too? - Well that's a secret between the Lord, myself, and the balloons. - I don't believe it. I really don't. - [Balloon Vendor] It's true Giacomino. - Ah, then you're a magician. - No, I'm not a magician. I'm just a man who sells balloons. - You wouldn't lie to me I hope, would you? - [Balloon Vendor] No, Giacomino. - No, really? - Really. - But when the balloons float up to heaven, do they see the angels when they're talking to the Lord? - Oh yes, certainly. Although not all the angels are up there. Lots of angels are here around you, Giacomino, right here, right now. - Yeah, that's a fact. You know there's mama, papa, Sister Maria, 20 Years, even the doctor, the friends that come to visit me. They know my papa, and those at the circus too. - And you, Giacomino, and you. (sad piano music) (orchestral music)
