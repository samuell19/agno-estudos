What's got into you? Why did you come here? Don't you realise that Isabella could see us? - Have you got any? I can't take this any more. If I don't get some soon I'll go mad. Don't be like that, Franco. Have you asked Isabella? We had an argument. She even stole what I had, damn her. Try to hold out. When I've finished work we'll find some. Trust me. I'll help you. Now go. I'm counting on you. Thanks. I'll be waiting. Isabella. Your scarf. What's wrong? The sign's fallen off again. - Do you want me to go and fix it? - No, not tonight. You can do it in the morning. As usual, Isabella's late again. I don't know what's wrong with that girl. This is the third time. There's no need to get angry, just give her a hefty fine. I certainly will, and I'll fire her if she's as late as she was yesterday. Look at this dress. Try to take more care of the clothes. We have another show tomorrow. Look at this. - I'll be more careful. - Always in a hurry to leave. You're all the same, that's all you think about. What does she expect? She's so annoying. Being a widow is hard for her. - How long were the lights off? - Ten minutes. How long had the girl worked for you? About two years. What was she like? Very lively. Rather undisciplined, but there's nothing bad I could say about her. As far as you know, did she have many friends? Inspector, I'm not going to be much help here. I'm the managing director. You should ask the two girls who lived with her. I can't believe it. Such a terrible thing. It still hasn't sunk in. Poor thing, she was always so cheerful, so... Come on, stop crying. It's not going to do any good. Inspector Silvestri, this is Countess Cristiana, the owner of the company. Haven't I met you before, madam? Or am I mistaken? Yes, we have actually met before. Because of my husband's accident. Exactly. It was a car accident. I imagine you'll be able to help me. You must know all about your girls. Inspector, this isn't a boarding school. I don't know or care about what they do when they're not here. Well... I'm going to be in the studio. - Will you excuse me? - Of course. Come on, Peggy. Stop crying- What good is it going to do? What time was it when you went out to fix the sign? About seven. It was banging and the noise bothered Madame Cristiana. I went out and fixed it as best I could. I protest! Mr Morlachi, I demand an explanation. I'd only just come through the gates when these men grabbed me. - Ask the inspector. Calm down and tell me why you're here. - I'm Marquis Riccardo Morelli... - Very well, but answer my question. He's come to pick me up. He's my fianc√©. - Why are you laughing? - Because we live together. Did you know Isabella? You introduced us once, didn't you'? Yes, let's say I knew her, but only by sight. I see. Come on, Peggy. Be strong. Stop crying- It looks like she's the only one who's upset. They were very good friends. - You lived together? Who had she gone out with? Who was the last person to see her? I don't know. Leave her alone. Everybody knows who Isabella's lover was. - Who are you? - Cesare Lazzarini, fashion designer. - Will you tell me his name? - Whose? The lover's. Scalo. Franco Scalo, the famous antique dealer. - Police. Where's the inspector? - In there. I can assure you I don't know anything. - Excuse me a second. It's confirmed. Shall I go? - Yes, go. What kind of relationship did you have with Isabella? - We were friends. - Or lovers? I'm going to admit to something, but you mustn't be shocked. I don't believe in permanent and everlasting relationships. I understand. Do you know what this is? No, I don't. - What is it? - Cocaine. It was found in the house of your friend, Isabella. In Isabella's house? - So you didn't know about this? Never mind. But I must ask you to remain at my disposal. I'll see you again. Turn around. All right, you can go. Quickly. - What's wrong, Cesaretto? - This was for poor Isabella.. - You're right. - Now who'll wear it? Let me see... - Peggy... - Not me, please. I can't. For heaven's sake don't cry or you'll ruin your make-up. - Greta, you model it. - No, I'm sorry, I can't wear it. - Don't be foolish. - It'll bring me bad luck. - Someone's going to have to model it. - I will. Come on, hurry up. Why doesn't that surprise me? She's so cynical. All right, you can go. Turn round. Good. Walk. Just a minute. Something's missing. The brooch! The green brooch. We can fix that now. Where is it? Isabella brought her own. She kept it in one of these boxes. Here it is. Look what I've found. Isabella kept a diary. It sounds interesting. Listen. "He's a man who arouses deep and desperate feelings in me. "I'd be prepared to die for him." Let me see. - I don't think we've got the right... - What are you doing? Are you all mad? Does this seem like the right time? Go on, off you go. Get ready. We should give this to the police. I found it and I'd like to hand it in myself, if you don't mind. As you wish. Why didn't you come? I was on my way out but I don't feel well. You know why. Of course, I understand. Try to come right away. I've got some. Listen, Franco. I've found a diary. - Isabella's diary. Isabella's diary? Who else knows about it? Everybody, unfortunately. I realised too late that there could be something compromising about you in it. I kept it and said I'd hand it in to the police. Good. We'll have time to take a look at it. - I'll come straight over. - You don't sound well at all, Franco. Franco, can you hear me? Yes, Nicole. Sorry, I can't even breathe. But now you've got some I'll feel better. Bye. I'll see you soon. Hurry up, girls. Greta, you're next. - Everything all right there, Marco? - Yes, Madame. - Cesaretto, where were you? - I'm here. I looked everywhere for you. Why do I have to do everything myself? Telephone. - For me? - Yes, for you. - Hello. Nicole, is that you? - Yes. Who's speaking? - It's Franco. I can't make it over there. I feel too ill. You come over. Please. Now. I feel like I'm suffocating. How am I supposed to get away? All right, I'll do my best. I'll try to come right away. There, it's all right now. Peggy, Franco's sick. He needs me. I need to rush over and see him. Will you lend me your car? But the show's not over yet. I don't care. Give me the keys but don't let anyone see you. - Peggy, what are you doing? - Nothing, just getting my handkerchief. The alarm switch is hidden in the glove compartment. - Have fun but don't come home too late. - Don't worry. I want to keep you company till Tao-Li gets back. Aren't you afraid of being at home on your own? I'm actually very tired and I'd like to go straight to bed. But you'll have to stay up till Nicole brings your car back. Very well. As you wish. Come in. I didn't want to leave you. I'd have worried about you being alone in that house. - Clarice, are you still here? Yes, I've only just finished. Didn't Miss Tao-Li come back with you? She's gone to a party. She'll be home later. Clarice is our guardian. I'll be going. I left your dinner in the oven to keep it warm. If Miss Tao-Li wants her concoction, it's ready. She just needs to heat it up. Thank you, Clarice. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. - You never listen to me. - I do listen. You don't. And I'm tired of telling you the same thing over and over. I've told you a thousand times. I'm afraid I've fallen in love with you. But you don't care. Why? Calm down and come here. You see... I'm not well. I know you think I'm foolish, and that drives me insane. I'm sick, Unhappy... Don't be like that. I understand you. I'm your friend. Come on, cheer up. - I'll have one of your cigarettes. - No! Stop. Leave it. What is it'? I just wanted a cigarette. What have I done? I'll get it for you. You'll mess up my bag otherwise. Here. Good evening, it's Inspector Silvestri. I'm sorry to bother you. I'm calling about your car. We found it unlocked and abandoned. Had it been stolen? No, I lent it to my friend Nicole. Yes, she asked to borrow it so she could visit a friend who wasn't well. Has something happened? I'd rather speak to you about this in person. May I come over? Very well, I'll be here. What's wrong? They've found my car but not Nicole. God, what's happened to her? - Is the inspector coming? - Yes, he wants to speak to me. Then I'll leave. I'd rather the police didn't find me with you. Yes, it's best if nobody knows you were here. Yes, it is best. Especially for you. - I'm sorry. - I'll see you tomorrow. "I caught Peggy trying to steal 100,000 lire from my bag. "She started crying and told me she needed it. "She's pregnant but can't deal with the scandal. "I lent her the money because I felt sorry for her. "Tomorrow I'll ask the bastard for 200,000 lire." WHERE IS THE DIARY? I burnt it... Sorry, I know it's late for visiting, but this is an urgent matter. Don't worry. Please, have a seat. What's it about? Charles, you can go. I got back a short while ago and found Nicole in my shop... murdered. I'd gone to the studio to collect Nicole. You remember... we met there. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find her. So I went back home. Believe me, I'll never forget what I saw. Sorry, but why did you come here instead of going to the police? Nicole was my friend. She was killed in my shop. The police are bound to blame me. I need an alibi. - You must help me. - Me? What have I got to do with this? You're in as much trouble as I am. We need to say that we were together at the studio until we left. I'll vouch for you and you'll vouch for me. - It's in both of our interests. - You're mad. The police have no reason to suspect me. You're the one who's in a fix. Perhaps you really did kill her. No. Call the police right now or I'll do it. Go on, then, and you can tell them about the lOUs. What lOUs? The lOUs you signed to guarantee a seven million lire loan for Isabella that you couldn't pay. Is that true? Riccardo, you didn't tell me. ls it true? Oh, my God. My dear Marquis, you haven't got a penny to your name. You're completely ruined and afraid of the scandal. That's an excellent reason to kill Isabella Perhaps Nicole too, to make sure the police didn't get hold of the diary. Who knows, maybe all the expiry dates were written in it. What diary? I don't know anything about it. Don't lie, Riccardo. I told you Nicole had found Isabella's diary. As you can see, we're tied to each other by a strong thread. If you don't want the police to pry into your affairs you'd better do as I say. I'll go back to my shop now and call the inspector. I'll tell him that we were together all the time. Agreed? Why won't you believe me? I burnt that diary. It contained things about me that I didn't want people to know. I burnt it. I swear I burnt it. Believe me. How did that girl get in here? - She had a key. - And why is that? I'd given it to her. - She used to visit me sometimes. - Her as well? You mustn't think that I... I'd left Isabella for Nicole. How many other people had keys to that door? Nobody else. - Except me, of course. Did you take drugs with her too? - What are you saying, Inspector? - Enough, Scalo! Who are you fooling? You've got a drug habit. It's written all over your face. I can even tell you where you get your drugs. as for the girls who, shall we say, keep you company, or who try to fight your habit, like Isabella did, or who take drugs themselves, like this one... That may well be the case, but it doesn't mean that I'm a murderer. Besides, I have an alibi. I was with... I haven't asked you about that... yet. We'll talk about it in good time. - When? - Right now, in my office. - Do you recognise it? - Yes, that's the one. - Are you sure? Wait. I wrote down the first few numbers. Here we go... 4, 5, 3. What did I tell you? Did you see if a man or a woman was driving? A man, definitely. He wore black and he didn't seem to have a face. He could've been wearing a mask. I don't know. I looked at him because I heard a horn. - What horn? - The car horn, Inspector. It didn't go for long though. Then suddenly it stopped. Could there be an alarm connected to the horn? Wait, I'll check. Yes, there is one. It's at the back of the glove compartment. - How long did it sound? - I don't know. - Not very long, like I said. - Tell me how long. That's it. Pretty much that long. If you didn't know where it was, you'd take a while to find it. But if you did know where it was hidden, you'd only need a few seconds. Come through. Have a good look at these men. Did you ever see any of them in Miss Peggy's car? You know him? You've seen him in the car? Of course she's seen me. In the car and on foot. Nothing strange about that. I didn't say it wasn't. Let's keep going. - Him. I saw him in the car. - Of course. What's the point of this? It's all a farce. Be quiet. You didn't just see me, did you? Open your eyes, you fool. Him, for instance. You saw him too, didn't you? Do you only want to know who went in the car with Miss Peggy? Why? Because that gentleman came to the house last night. He came with Miss Peggy. At last we're getting somewhere. You bastard! What are you trying to insinuate? Do you want to ruin me? That's enough. Damned murderer! Damn you! Confess. You're the murderer. Inspector, have him examined. He's impotent. That's why he hates women. He'd kill them all because he can't have them. Why don't you tell the inspector that that's why your wife left you? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm suffocating. - Hold his shoulders. - Calm down. Take him to the infirmary. Let me go. - None of you knew he had epilepsy? - I didn't know. You may go. I'm very sorry but I'm going to have to keep you here, Mr Morlachi, and you too, Mr Lazzarini. - What does "keep you here" mean? - It means I'm legally detaining you. Excuse me, Inspector, but you need a good reason to do that. Nicole's murderer had been in Peggy's car before because he knew where the alarm switch was hidden. - May I go? - May I? No, you'll stay here too. This is absurd. I've provided an alibi. - The marquis confirmed it. - It's true. We were together. Don't worry, gentlemen, I haven't forgotten. You were together until gone 11. Nicole was killed after 10. - So why do you need us? - Well... When I called Peggy to tell her that we'd found her car, it was about 11.30 I arrived at her place 15 minutes later, but she was no longer there and the house was in a complete mess. Maybe they killed her too and hid her body somewhere. As far as this last event is concerned, gentlemen, I'd say your alibi was worthless. It's already nine o'clock. Why must we sit in the dark? As if we weren't scared enough already. Do what you want, but try to stay calm. How can we stay calm? Aren't you worried about everything that's happened? I'm afraid too, I admit it. But there's no use panicking. If only the men would come back. We're the only ones left here. Mr Morlachi, at last. What's happened? What? That's ridiculous. Why? What right do they have? I see. Very well. Of course. Don't worry. - They've detained all five of them. - Why? Clearly the police believe that one of them is the murderer. I expected it. can we go? Yes, please go. Be strong. I envy them, they live together. At least they can keep each other company. - I'm going too, Madame. Wait... Why don't you come and sleep at my house tonight? What? I just live round the corner. Why should I go all the way to yours out in the country? I could come and sleep at your house. No, I'm sorry, but I'd rather be on my own. Besides, you'd feel even more afraid at my house. Aren't you scared on your own? They lived with you. Isabella's been killed, and Peggy... I know. But I'm certain that nothing will happen tonight. All the men have been detained and I'm sure one of them is the murderer. Madame, I don't want to go home, I want to sleep here. No, my dear. Leave like the others. But I'm frightened. I live out of town in a house on its own. Don't be childish, Greta. Tomorrow is a busy day. Work must go on. Listen... Isabella and Nicole were involved in something that doesn't concern us. We've got nothing to be frightened of. Do you understand? Go now, and don't worry. Miss, the marquis called to say he's stuck in town on business. I know. Make me some tea, please. I've brought your tea, miss. Just a moment, please. Come in. Leave it up there, Charles. I can do it myself. See how the murderer butchered that poor girl? He must have used a red-hot iron. We're dealing with a madman here. Or a homicidal sex maniac. - Who only kills beautiful girls. - Exactly. Perhaps female beauty makes him lose his head and kill. We're going to have to start again from scratch. Inspector, Forensics are outside if you want to see the footprints in the garden. The footprints start over there. The murderer drove up here on this road, got out and walked down the slope to the house. The prints match the ones found in the studio gardens. - Are you sure? - Yes, we took casts of them. I could have sworn the culprit was one of the five men we detained. - We'll have to release them at once. This time they really do have a cast-iron alibi. And I provided them with it. Riccardo Morelli. Make sure everything's there. Come in. Mr Morlachi, I'd like to speak to you for a moment if I may. Yes, dear. Come in. Mr Morlachi, I'm a calm woman, I'm not at all nervous. But I find the thought of a sex maniac prowling around our studio really very disturbing. I've decided to take some leave. I've booked a seat on the flight to Paris tomorrow. - All right, Tao-Li. - Thank you. By the way, are you still living in the countess's house? - Yes. Why? - Nothing. Just memories. When the count was alive I'd often go and visit them. It's a beautiful house. I remember being able to see all over Rome from the terrace. Yes, but right now I'd rather see the rooftops of Paris. - I don't doubt that. Enjoy yourself. Search as much as you like. I burnt everything that could compromise you. When I heard you'd been arrested I got rid of Peggy's body. They could have found it. And I killed Greta to give you an alibi. Perfect. Perfect, but horrible. I don't know how I did it. I'd never have thought I'd have the strength to kill. But I did it for you. I can imagine what it cost you. But tell me, how did you manage to take Peggy's body to Morelli's house? I didn't take her there myself. I just put her in the boot... and Greta did the rest. Why did you decide to use Greta? Well, I knew she'd be on her own at home. - That made everything easier. - Well done. The police are convinced they're dealing with a sex maniac. and now, with Greta, that makes four. Stop it. What's wrong, my darling? Kiss me. Are you worried, darling? What a mess. It's all because of that stupid idiot Isabella. Her blackmail had become unbearable. Money, money and more money. Precisely, because she unfortunately found out... that my husband's death wasn't an accident, she should have realised that it was both foolish and dangerous to push it. The more we gave her, the more she wanted. - She asked for it. - She thought she had us on a string. She felt like she was the only witness to a perfect crime. Her death would have been perfect too, if only that damn diary hadn't surfaced. But it's all over now. We have nothing more to worry about, my darling. Nothing at all. No, that's where you're wrong. Very wrong. We'll never have peace until we give the police a culprit. Peace! Listen to me. We'll never be free unless we put a face to their sex maniac. Until they catch him they'll be watching us. Every victim was at the fashion house. They've got no proof against us but the case has become a sensation. It's all over the papers. The scandal's raging. We need to find a solution. So what do you want to do? I know, darling. We should go away to the moon. We need to kill one last time. And you'll be the one who does it. They're definitely watching me. Don't worry, darling, I'll create a perfect alibi for you. Relax. No, Massimo. You can't ask me to do a thing like that. I refuse. I can't do it. Do you understand? You've done it already. Yes, you're right, I've done it already, but I had a very different motive then. You were in danger. I had no choice. I knew that if I didn't do it I'd have lost you forever. My love for you gave me the strength to do it. But it was horrible. Don't cry. Listen to me. You need to do what I say. You have to kill Tao-Li. You have to make it look like suicide. Do you understand? They'll find the mask by her side and think that she was the culprit. If we don't do it, everything we've done so far will have been pointless. You're surprised to see me alive, aren't you, Massimo? Your plan was certainly very ingenious. It was going to be perfect, just the way you like it, but you didn't count on on the shop awning breaking my fall. Please... Be quiet. I know very well what you'd like to say. You'd like to deny it. But I saw you with the jewels. You planned everything. Only you knew that I'd use the ledge if I was in danger. Remember? You were the one who suggested it. It was your idea. Cristiana, I swear it was an accident. Do you really still think that you can fool me? Yes, it was a very ingenious plan. They'd have found me dressed like this and everything would have been clear and you'd have been free. Now I understand why you wanted to marry me in secret and in such a hurry. You were so in love with me. So in love. You were, but with my villa, the house, the studio, my money... You wanted to get your hands on everything I own by killing me. Cristiana, I beg you... You're wrong, darling. It's not true. You're imagining it all, darling. Believe me. I swear, Cristiana... It was just an accident. I didn't mean it to happen. How could you think that? I love you, darling, so much. We'll go away. We'll be together forever. I'll never leave you. Get me Inspector Silvestri...
