Fucking what are you thinking huh? - Donnie be careful. Pour me some. Relax, all right. I got you something. - Oh did you? - Check the top drawer. Open the drawer. - Where? - In the top drawer. - Okay. - No, not that top drawer Shauna. Sorry. - This one okay. - Donnie what is that? Oh my god it's so beautiful. I love it - Well turn around let me put it one you. - Hurry, come on. - Hold your hair up. - Okay. I love it. It's so good. - Two years is a long time Tommy boy. - Good to be back. Where's Gabby? - She went to her mom's for the weekend. So this is what those union dues will pay for huh? - Yeah not bad huh. Come on in, let's get drinking. It works a hundred percent of the time. - No way. - Look, anybody who's ever talked shit about just the tip clearly has never even fucking tried it. Cousin Pat used to do it all the time. It was like his signature play. Look, take notes Tommy. So you're sitting there with a girl. You're hooking up. You're in your underwear whatever. But, she's into it. But there's a little hesitation. So she says something like, "I don't know if we should." So then you hit her with, "Let me just put the tip in. "Just to see how it feels." And of course her silence means yes. So you wait a few moments, give it a little nudge. All of a sudden she's begging you to keep going. - I don't know, seems a little fucked up. - The world ain't so black and white Tommy. Look, just the tip is a perfect life lesson for all aspects of life. If somebody doesn't like you. They don't like what you're putting down. You just give them a little bit of you and all of a sudden they're begging you for more. Oh, the asshole mobile really arrives in style. Ladies and gentlemen, the biggest douche bag in Queens. I was beginning to think you weren't going to show. Oh I'm just here to drink some brew-chachos with my bro-chachos. - Oy oy oy what's this? I tell you to bring beers and you bring six. What are you and Tommy gonna drink? - Ha ha ha, go fuck yourself Gene all right. Come on you know me better than that. Got a cooler in the trunk. - Yeah good to see you too, fuckhead. - How you doing Donnie? - I'm good. I'm real good. Look at this. The Olson boys we're all back together. I love it. Hey Tommy grab that cooler out of the trunk for me all right. You're telling me you got fired from the satellite job for fighting the boss' son. - I didn't really fight him. I just kicked his ass. You know, boss saw the whole thing and that was it. Got in my van and came back here. What do you mean? Where you staying now? - My van. - I was afraid you were gonna say that. - I don't mind it. I mean I stayed in it all the time when I was traveling for work. I shower at the gym. - Are you serious? Why do you love that thing so much? - It's a beautiful piece of machinery. It's practical. Gets good gas mileage. You know it was the last thing Dad gave me before he died. I could realistically stay in it til January. - Wow. I got one brother who thinks he's fucking Tony Montana and another one who wants to live in a fucking van. Dad would be real proud. What are you gonna do for work? - I don't know. I kinda want to go back to school. - Oh look at that. College boy's gonna make a comeback huh? - I don't know. - All right. All right. - For now I guess I'll just try to find a job. - Maybe I could talk to somebody at the DOT. They might have an opening. - The road crew. Real glamorous all right. Don't you need a masters degree or something for that Gene? It's an honest job, Donnie, puts a roof over my head. - Yeah. - Maybe you should try it sometime. They got medical, they got dental. Retirement plan. - Retirement plan look at that. You get to look forward to a fixed income and I don't know death 10 years away. God, Gene you know you're really selling this one. - They'll start you off holding a flag. Maybe digging ditches. You work hard, show them that you're the best ditch digger on the crew, you'll work your way up quick. - You'll be the best ditch digger on the crew. God, that's like being the hottest plus size model. - What? - You know like like the prettiest fat chick. Like that famous girl. You know? She's the hottest fat girl in the whole world but if she wasn't fat nobody'd even know who she was. - What the hell does that have to do with digging ditches? - Look it sounded better in my head all right. Follow me here. She's famous because she's fat. And yeah she's a gorgeous girl and all that but if she wasn't fat she wouldn't even be pretty enough to model snow pants at Sears you know. - The hottest plus size super model. That's like the smartest retard in special ed. - Come on. - Oh okay PC police, how bout the fastest white kid in gym. - Wow. Oh that reminds me. Last night, when I got off the train this guy followed me and he chased me. You know I got rid of him but thought I might have recognized him. Didn't think I had any enemies when I left here but apparently I do. This is funny huh? - I may know a little something about that. - What did you do? - Might have paid my buddy to give you a little scare to welcome you back to the neighborhood. - Why would you do that? - Thought it'd be a good test. - You're a maniac. You're a sick maniac. - Tommy, I'm sorry all right about last night. - It's whatever. - No really I am. I was just trying to test you okay. - Test me for what? - I want you to come and work for me. - Selling coke? - Yeah. - I'm good. Thanks. - Tommy come on. Look it's good. You know I make a lot of money now. I just moved into a new place. - No thanks. - Just think about it all right. Come on you're gonna go back to school. School costs money don't it? - I don't know. - What are you gonna do, keep sleeping in your van? - I mean, maybe. - You want a ride over there at least? - Na, I'm good. - Look just think about it all right. - All right. - Tommy. - All right. - Think about it. - I'll see you later. * If you take one step * Then you will be a little closer * * To your dream than if you stay just where you are * * Keep that chin held up and * Fight your battles with your * Feet and heart both babe * You'll find a path that has your name * * Here I am * I'm ready to go again * Ready to say goodbye when the sky is high * * No reason to stay on ground * Lift your hands and you can touch it * * Fly the minute you've failed you've found * * Understand that you can have it all * * The wings are in your soul - My offer's simple Tommy. Look, we're in a position to offer a superior product at a competitive price. See I was fortunate enough to come upon this package at a whole sale price if you know what I mean. - You stole it? - Eh, acquired it. - How'd you get it? - Information. Look, people needed information that I had and my price was this package. - Why not cash? - Because I saw the bigger picture here Tommy. Look this stuff is how we're gonna make money okay it's the future. Got a bunch of old clients all right from my old outfit. Rich ones you know. They're all lawyers, stockbrokers and desperate housewives on Park Avenue okay. They're gonna be our first stop. - Aren't they buying it from somebody else? Of course, that's why they're hooked. - How're you gonna get them back? - Customer service. See let me explain the average experience with you. Thursday night you think oh I think I want some blow. So you know you get ready for the next day and around the fifth or sixth cocktail that night you remember you gotta call the blow guy. So they give him a call and if this guy even shows up at all he's either 30 minutes late or he brings you a mediocre product. And it's cut with anything from baking soda to toilet cleaner. You understand why? - He's busy? - No cause it's a sellers market okay. The dealers have all the control here and they know it. They're at the mercy of the dealers. But we're gonna be the ones to show them people really care about them too. All right, so that's the casual weekend coke head but what about the gotta have it every day kind of people. - They're all the same. - Won't these other dealers like get mad at like start a turf battle? This isn't a music video, Tommy okay. You don't start turf wars. That's not how it's done. Are you in or out? - I want 60-40. - Now you're thinking. I knew you'd come around. Plus if you would have settled for anything less I would have thrown you off the roof for being a pussy. Now come on, let's go make some money. * The money on my mind * A great deal of it * Will fix me all I've ever desired * * The money on my mind * I count it every time. * One two three four five six seven * * And I count it * Woo * One two three four * 24/7 and I stack it * Driving in my car * Think hell and I inhale it * Our parties going down * And everybody's counting * One two three four * Jumping on the floor * Five six seven eight * One two three four * Running around or so * In paper we try to give us all we need * * We're falling down * Giving up indecency * Filling our pockets with empty dreams * * Filling our pockets with empty dreams * - Hey, what do you think? Tie? No Tie? Eh. No tie. 15Gs in one week huh not bad kid. - Yeah. - Better than sweating your ass off over there with Genie there right? - Yep. - You know I'm proud of you Tommy. Got big plans for the two of us. - What are you doing? - You gotta use a hundred. It's cleaner. - You do cocaine now? - So what? I'm celebrating. What you never tried it before? - No. I never did coke before. Is that crazy? - Well here, try some. - I'm not doing it. And just know I'll think less of you if you do? - Ooh the virgin's gonna think less of me. What am I ever gonna do? - I'm not a fucking virgin. - Yeah bud, you are. Look Tom you got nothing to worry about all right I got us a table over at Sparks tonight. I used to promote over there you know so they always hook me up. You can't get laid in that joint, I don't know baby, maybe you just can't. - Thought we're going out for dinner. - We'll get you a burger or something on the road. What are you worried about? Woo! Okay, come on let's blow doors. - Come on Donnie you gotta drink this. - Ugh. I ordered a 7 and 7. It's water. Drink it. - Get that shit away from me. Bring me a 7 and 7. Tommy. Why didn't you go home with that girl? She liked you. - That girl was a hooker. - So? I had fun tonight. Did you? - Sure. - We got a big day tomorrow. - What happened to you? Fuck. Yo. Where the hell are you? I just got a call from Mr. Woodward. You were supposed to meet him at the sailboat pond and you're not there. When I told you today was important I meant it, Tommy. Mr. Woodward is picking up a large order. He's leaving for the Hamptons in 20 minutes and this guy could be huge for us all right. He's gonna go to the Hamptons and get real fucked up and share his goodies with all of his friends and those friends are gonna say hey this is some good shit I'm gonna give your guy a call. Only you're not fucking there! - All right, I'm on it. I'll be right there. Yeah I just delivered it to Dr. Krause. I'm on my way to 67th now then 62nd. Good. I just got a call for right in that area. Guy just got into town. Only wants two grams. You got that on you? - Yep. It's the Empire Hotel. Room 622. You got that? - 622, 622. I got it. This is it. Don't pussy out. Here. Take my wallet. Take my phone. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll get that when I'm done. Oh, you're sexy. What you got there? - Give me your phone. Your phone. I'm reporting an attack on a woman. Guy ran west on 73rd toward Columbus. No I don't think so. Look she's on 73rd Street. 53 West 73rd. Hurry. Are you okay? Come on. Come over here and sit down. Come on, it's okay. I can't believe that just happened. I knew there was something wrong with that guy. Fuck. - Thank you. For what? Oh, it's okay. But that fucker got away and you're over here shivering. I'm okay. - Police should be here soon. They'll probably make you go to the hospital give a statement and tell them what the guy looked like and everything. - All I can remember he had red shoes. - Hey, I'm real sorry I gotta go. - Wait what? - I don't like cops I'm sorry. At least tell me your name. - It's Thomas. But everybody pretty much calls me Tommy. - I'm Zoey. - Zoey. That's a perfect name. Zoey, it was a pleasure meeting you. It wasn't a pleasure. Look I'm sorry about everything. Who are you? - Who the fuck are you? - I'm Tommy. I live here. - Who's making all that noise out there huh? Who you talking to? Oh you met my little brother? - Oh he's cute. - Hey don't get any ideas all right. You too. This one's mine. - It's you. - Yeah, guess it is. How you feeling? - Kind of numb. The doctors loaded me all full of depression pills. - You're back to work already? - I took one day off. That's gotta be tough. - Well, I figured I laid around my apartment crying enough. It was time to bring my sadness to work. - It's only been a couple of days. You'll be fine soon. - You promise? Will you do me a favor? - Yeah. Anything. - Walk me home. You want me to walk you home? - I'm sorry. That must have sounded ridiculous. I didn't even ask you if you were busy or maybe you're here waiting for your girlfriend or something. It's okay. I'll just be extra careful. - I'd love to walk you home. I mean, if you want me to. - Yeah. Remind me of your name. - It's Tommy. - Do you remember mine? - Zoey. - I bet you're wondering why on Earth I'd ever walk home again. - A little bit, yeah. - I guess I needed to prove to myself that I wouldn't let this to take over my life. You know, face my fears. And here I am, a man walking me home. It's not going too well. - No need to rush it. If I was a girl, I probably wouldn't walk anywhere, ever. - Where do you work? - What do you do? - Oh me? - Go ahead. - Sales marketing. - Okay, where's your office at? - My office? Downtown. But I'm always running all over the city meeting clients. - Sounds exciting. I design shoes. And by that I mean the person I get coffee for designs shoes. - Working your way up. - Something like that. - What kind of shoes? - Women's shoes. - Like the ones with those giant high heels you always see girls wobbling around in after a couple drinks? So how do you like living on the west side? - Well I did until. - Oh right. I'm sorry. - I still have another six months left on my lease so I'll probably stay but I don't know. - What? What is it? - He's still out there. That fucking guyès still out there. And I know it sounds crazy but everywhere I go I feel like he's behind me. Watching me. Waiting to finish what he started. - All clear. - What if he's been following me for a while and knows where I live? - A guy like that. I have no idea. - Ugh, thanks. That really makes me feel safe. - I'm sorry. You want me to lie to you? This is not good. This is a really fucked up situation. That guy was sick. And people like that are unpredictable. What did the cops say? - Just don't walk around there at night. And that they'd send a patrol car to the area more frequently. - Well that's good. That's a start. - I guess. Tell me more. - Not much to tell. I went to college for a semester. And then I got a job working at a satellite company. Not like the little ones on houses like the big 150 foot high ones. That was fucking brutal. But I got to see the world I guess so that was good. - And now you sell and market. - Yeah I actually work for my brother. - Huh, that must be fun. - No. He's actually a huge asshole. - What do you guys sell? - What do we sell? Computer stuff. Hardware, software that type of stuff. - Very impressive. - So what does a gorgeous girl like you do for fun when she's not climbing the shoe empire ladder? - A gorgeous girl like me? Let's see. I hang out with my friends. I watch movies, read. But not that often. - So you wouldn't consider yourself an avid reader? - God no. - I feel like when people say they're avid readers that's like the best part of their life. Reading books. They're bragging about reading all the time. It's actually a little sad. - Exactly. I mean there's a difference between being well read and an avid reader. An avid reader has no friends only books and cats. You don't like cats? - Hate them. Filthy animals. - I think I love you. - You love me? Girl who hates cats. That's the dream. - Okay, I think you need to dream bigger. - That's only one bullet from the list. - Ah well thank you for walking me home. - It's my pleasure. Okay I guess I'll see you around. - Hey. Do you wanna have dinner tomorrow night with me? - Sure. Yes I would. - Really? - Yeah. Why not? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - That wasn't his daughter. - Yes oh my god like when they first sat down I was like oh how nice a father and daughter dinner and then. - She made the first move though not him. - Yes. What was that? Like she looked like 16. - Good for him. - True love. - If you look up true love in the dictionary you'll find a picture of those two. Or maybe just like a like a drawing of a teenage girl rubbing a 50 year old man's inner thigh. - Great dinner otherwise. - I thought that kind of enhanced it. - It sort of did. Didn't it? - So where to? - Up to you. - Up to me? We could get ice cream or beer or both. Or I have a great bottle of wine at my apartment. - Okay. - Yeah? - Let's do it. But just one drink okay? - The wine could actually be terrible. I have no idea. I don't know anything about wine. My brother shouldn't be home. He's supposed to be at a work thing. Friday's like his busy day. Donnie! Donnie! Donnie! Donnie! Wake up Donnie. Come on wake up. Donnie. - Check his pulse. - Wake up god damn it Donnie. Wake up. Wake up. He's alive - Tommy. - Fuck! - Tommy. - God damn it Donnie. I'm so sorry. Let me go get you a cab. - Did you fuck her? - Shut up. - Tommy, did you fuck her man? Did you fuck her Tommy? - Jesus Donnie. You're a god damn junky now? Why didn't I see this coming. Fuck! - I'm proud of you Tommy. That girl was hot. - I thought you were dead. - Morning. - Yeah, that it is. What are you doing? - What am I doing? - Yeah. - What am I doing? What are you doing sitting in this chair? - I'm sitting here cause I had to watch you all night to make sure you didn't die in your sleep. - Tommy really? Are you fucking kidding me? Nobody asked you to do that okay. And you better go get some fucking coffee okay cause not for nothing we have deliveries in an hour and you better not fuck this up. Seriously. Look at me. This is important. Look, I'm sorry all right. It was Friday night I just, I wanted to relax a little bit and. - Do you hear yourself? - Yeah. - This is heroin. This is serious. You got a real problem. - Ah look it's not like I do it that often all right. Only once in a while. Look it's really no big deal. Tommy, I promise you you got nothing to worry about. Tommy. - What? - Look at me. I said look at me. You better not say a fucking word to Gene. You hear me? - Yeah, I hear you. - Get up. Get the fuck up. Come on. Get up. We got somewhere to be. What am I speaking fucking Chinese? Get up! - So what's it like in Mexico? - Different all over. I am from a pretty small town. A village really. - You miss it? - You know, it's fashionable for people to say they couldn't wait to get out of their home town but the truth is I loved it. I miss it. I think about it all the time. - Well why'd you leave? - Why does anyone leave something they love? The search. The search for something better. And there was no life for me there. I could get a job the hospital or become a school teacher. Those were my two options. And I knew if I did it, I'd be bored out of my mind and end up resenting the place I loved so much. - You must be a real hotshot back home? Brave city girl in America? - Oh I was. For a second. Now nobody cares anymore. I've been living here for two years and my parents still think this is a phase. They'll ask every month when I'm coming home. And they don't mean to visit. - That's sweet though. Some people all they need is their family. Like my brother Gene and my dad. They don't need to be fulfilled at a job or have a career. They get through the day because their family's counting on them. And they're not bitter about it. That's just how it is. - That's the trap. I don't know how it is in Queens. But where I am from people don't have the perspective or the guts to even think about chasing something big. - For being right across the river, you'd be surprised how little perspective some people from Queens have. Me, I always knew I wanted something more. Whatever that is. - What about your brother Donnie? - I'm sorry you had to see that. It's okay. I mean, how did he get like that? - He was always a bad kid. A tough kid. He started selling weed and pills in high school so I guess it only made sense that it led him to becoming. - Becoming a what? - I just mean it led him to becoming a drug addict. - You are a good brother. - Well. I hope your new job of walking me home isn't interfering with your actual job. - Don't worry about it. It's the best part of my day. - Really? Of course. - Hey do you want to check out my roof? - Roof? Yeah. He won't go to rehab? - He'd have to admit he's not perfect first. Forget admitting he's has a problem. - What about your older brother? What if he talks to him? - Gene? Gene only gives the illusion of being in charge. Donnie's never listened to him. Not once. - What about your parents? - My parents? Well my dad's dead and my mom might as well be. So I don't think they'll be much help. - Oh Tommy I'm so sorry. I didn't know. It's all right. It never came up. - I never told my parents about what happened to me. - What? Are you serious? - I know most people the first person they'd call would be their mom. But I guess I am too embarrassed. I want to protect them from it. Just imagine how worried and devastated they'd be if I tell them. How's that fair? Yes, I'll feel a little bit better if I tell them but in exchange they get destroyed. It seems pretty selfish to me. - That's not selfish. That's their job to worry about you. - I don't know. - Did you at least tell your friends? - What friends? The girls from work? If I tell my old friends from home, they'll just tell my parents. - So it's only me? - You're it. The one who saved me. Go ahead. Answer it. - I'll see him in a little bit. - Maybe it's important. - I'm sure it's just work stuff. - Do you even like working with him? Are you happy? - Am I happy? I don't know. About as happy as somebody could be doing work. Or maybe a little less. - Do you see yourself doing it forever? - Forever? Don't you think I'll die first? No I figure I'll do it til we run out of stuff to sell. - I need to get ready for work. Shower? - Oh, oh, oh. Look who decided to show up. Thank you for joining us. Where were you? - I spend the night with the girl of my dreams and all you can say is "where were you". - The girl of your dreams? The one? - Yeah. - You look a little different huh? You didn't? No? - Yeah. - Yeah. Of course. - You didn't use a condom did you? - She made me. - Come over here. Let me show you this. This right here is all that we have left. Oh my god. Been busting our asses for three weeks you know that and it finally paid off. How bout you huh? You make any money? - Yeah I made some money. - How much you make? - Around 20. - 20 racks in three weeks? That's not fucking bad right? Right? - Sure. - It's a lot better than busting your ass out there with Gene as a fucking road crew junky or something. Humping hamburgers or whatever. - Sure. - Now, Tommy I know you're probably wondering what we're gonna do next right. Well don't you worry about it okay. Big brother has got it all figured out. We're gonna be all right. Let me show you something. Now I know your fist intro to this stuff was a little rough. But I promise you it's gonna be okay. Right? This stuff is super high quality. Extremely potent. Super high demand. And guess what. We got the only hook. - This is your big idea, selling heroin? - Yeah. - When I came here today was gonna tell you I was thinking about quitting while I was ahead and you know what fuck this. I'm out. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - You're out? Just like that huh? You ungrateful little fuck. I brought you in on something Tommy. I did you a fucking favor. I made you my partner. I thought oh I don't know, it might be nice to build something with my little brother and this. This is how you fucking repay me? Are you fucking kidding me there was a million guys who would have done your job. I could have had anybody. I could have did it myself. - You're fucking clueless you that? Oh I'm fucking clueless really? This coming from the fucking fairy who a week ago couldn't get his cock sucked. - What the fuck are you talking about? - What do you mean what am I talking about? Huh, what's wrong? You gonna fucking cry Tommy? What's wrong? You know what I'm talking about. You know exactly what I mean. That little fucking cute little sweet cherry you'd popped last week. Right? The one who was in here the other night. You could have never got that without me. I made you Tommy. I made you cool. I taught you how to talk. I taught you how to dress. I put money in your fucking pockets. And this is how you repay me? This is how you fucking treat me? - How I treat you? Donnie you're fucking killing yourself. Selling heroin. Your kinds of customers. The fucking people who do that shit. - Yeah, they're not all upper east side fucking housewives okay. But guess what Tommy, I didn't just get into this game three weeks ago okay. I know my way around a little bit. And guess what, that shit right there, that's where the money is. And that is where I'm going. - What happens when some fucking junky pulls a gun on you? Then I'll pull mine back. - Looks like your mind's made up. You wanna fucking kill yourself. Go ahead. I won't be here to watch. Then get the fuck out then huh. You heard me. Get the fuck outta here. - Do you remember me telling you about that girl Rachael in my office? No I don't think so. - The one from Texas. - Oh the rancher. Yeah. - Yeah. Well. She's a temp. And I don't think she has a college degree. So I was thinking about asking her what agency she's from and how she did it. That's apparently a backdoor into the business world. And not a lot of people know about it. You put your foot in the door temping and sometimes that's all it takes. And I think you could be perfect for it. It's not like you don't have experience. You were a successful entrepreneur in the tech industry. That would look great on a resume. - I just sold stuff for my brother. I wouldn't call that entrepreneurship. - You need to talk yourself up. You facilitated sales. Cultivated client relationships from perspective to repeat customers. - If you think it's a good idea. I'll give it a try. - Good. Do you think your brother is doing all right running the business without you? - I'm sure he's just fine. Have you talked to him recently? - Not since I quit. - Don't you think a week is long enough to be mad at him? - No, I think a week is the bare bones minimum. - It's not good to hold onto anger like that. He's your brother. I think you should call him. Do it. Hola hola. It's Donnie. Leave a fucking message. The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. - Yo Donnie it's me I'm coming in. Yo Donnie you whackin it? What'd you forget your key? It's open. Yeah? Is this the residence of Donald Olson? - Yeah. Are you Donald Olson? - I'm his brother. What did he do? - I'm Detective De Luca. This is Rosenberg. We found his truck in a Shop Rite parking lot out on Staten Island. Two of the windows were smashed in but he never reported it. Is your brother here right now? - No. Did he mention anything about the car being stolen? - I haven't been around. - When's the last time you had contact with him? A week. - All right, is your brother married? No. - Well is there a girlfriend or someone that might be able to tell us when the last time he was seen? - I don't think so. I don't know. - All right sir. From the information you've given me as well as the condition of the vehicle, standard procedure would be a missing persons. What's your name sir? - Tommy - All right Tommy. I'm gonna need you to come down with me to the station. Give a statement so we'll be able to start the paperwork. Are you able to do that? - Okay. - All right. - Why didn't you tell me? I had no idea it was this bad. - I don't know I was afraid of what you would say. What Donnie would say. - And you guys selling cocaine together. That's just unreal to me. And you find him nearly dead with a needle in his arm and you don't come to me? What the fuck Tommy? I failed. - What? - I told Dad I'd watch over this family and look what happens. Donnie's missing and I have absolutely no idea where to look. I mean do you? I don't know who his friends are. I don't know who he might have pissed off or fucked over. All we can do is sit here waiting. And Donnie's out there. God I hope he is. - He's out there, it's Donnie. Tell me what to do Dad. I screwed up. I screwed up big time and I'm sorry. I'm glad you're not here to see this but would it have happened if you were? Hey. - I need you to come over. Donnie's missing. - What? Police found his Hummer in Staten Island. The windows were smashed. Nobody's heard from him. I don't know could be another dealer got mad at him. We don't know. It's too early to tell. - Tommy. I'm sorry. I just don't know what to say. Just come over. - Okay. If I'd just paid attention to him. His whole life's been a cry for help. If I wasn't so scared to stand up to him maybe things would be different. - Don't blame yourself. I mean his personality mixed with drugs. - He seemed fine a few weeks ago. Now this. - Tommy, it's not like he just started doing drugs. What do you mean? - He has a history of drug use. You said that yourself. - Look can we just sit here, drink these beers and just not think about it? - What did you mean by another dealer? - What? - On the phone, you said another dealer must have gotten mad at him. What did you mean? - Just like another dealer. Like he could have multiple dealers like another person who sold him drugs. - Did he ever tell you about a dealer being mad at him before or something? - No, he wouldn't talk to me about that. - He never told you about a dealer being mad at him before. So, how can another dealer be mad at him? - Look it was just a hunch. My junky brother is missing and that's what I came up with. I'm sorry I wasn't precise with my semantics all right. - Okay. I'm sorry. - I don't like cops. I'm sorry. I actually work for my brother. But I'm always running all over the city meeting clients. I'll do it til we run out of stuff to sell. - What kind of computer stuff did Donnie use to sell? What? - For the business. What was something you sold to people? - We uh. - Like just pretend for a minute that this business actually existed. What would you sell? - Zoey. Come on. Zoey we're all under a lot of stress but this. - Just admit it. Your brother is a drug dealer. - That's ridiculous. Come on. - Just. Your brother is a drug dealer and I think you are one too. - It was just for a couple weeks to make money for school. But I'm done with that now. I quit. - Oh God. I knew there was something off about you since the moment I met you. But I ignored it. Because I wanted to believe that I didn't have to be alone. Because I was stupid. Believe it please. You don't have to do this. - Get out. Zoey. Please. - Get out. Zoey. Come on. - Get out! Get out! - Don't do this. - Get out! - Fuck! - Where the fuck am I? Who the fuck are you? - Shut up. - Listen buddy, I don't know what you think. Or who you think I am but you got the wrong guy. Oh so that's what this is? What, are you gonna call some of your faggot buddies to come over and run a train on me? - I told you to shut up. - Where the fuck do I know you from? Softball? No, no, no, no, no, no. Why can't I put my finger on it. - What's the last thing you remember about tonight? - Tonight. I'm walking. Minding my own business and. - What were you doing? - I was going to church. Midnight mass. - You weren't out looking for a girl. A small one you could drag between two cars and. - Fuck. So that's what this is. What a beautiful and small world we live in. What you gonna kill me? Nah, you can't do it here. You didn't plan it right. - Maybe I'll take you way out in Jersey somewhere. Or maybe I'll drive right into the first truck I see. - No. You ain't gonna do none of that. Cause you look like you got a future. People who care about you. - Let's go for a ride. * You can come here anytime * The garden is neglected * But the door is open * You can come * Turn the light on * Sit with me * We'll no longer live in misery * * There's room to hold your burden * * My loving is for free * You can call me anytime * Or surprise me at the door * Cause I don't mind * You can come * Leave your troubled mind behind * * And forget about the time * The world is at our fingertips * * So why go outside
