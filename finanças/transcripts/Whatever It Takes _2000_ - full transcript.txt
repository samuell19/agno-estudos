Oh, man, that was whack. Jesus. Hey, Chris. Thanks for your help. Yeah, like Carter really liked your crap. You see what just happened? People saw that. Well, damn, man, you're too cocky. What? I saw you groping her. Look, it doesn't matter what I write, Maggie's not gonna go for that. Look, it doesn't matter what I write, Maggie's not gonna go for that. She volunteers at a nursing home, for God's sake. Why? That's what I'm talking about. Grant isn't exactly all hot for you either. That's great. The idea was "Ryan impresses Ashley," not "Ryan depresses Ashley." "Ryan gets pickle in Ashley," not "Ashley gets Ryan in pickle." Look, man... Chicks dig assholes. Okay? Check out stu and Harris. They're both gonna get laid tonight. Come on, I'll show you. Let's find Ashley. Remember in grade school when you always picked on the girl you liked? It's kind of like that. Some girls are just insecure. You're saying Ashley grant is insecure? She's the head cheerleader of insecurity. And if I treat her bad, she'll go for it? Absolutely. Absolutely. That doesn't make any sense. You've dated how many of these girls? That's what I thought. Now check out grant. Ashley. Hi. Simple question. Do you want her or not? Well, yeah, but... Okay.

Look, even if everything you said is true, I don't want to be mean to her. Right, seeing as how she's so sweet to you. Listen... you know what Ashley said to me today? She's looking for something special. I can get you there. You can be that guy. You just have to help me be that guy for Maggie. I thought I was being abducted. How come you bagged on the party? I had better things to do. Like sleep. You should try it. So I talked to Chris Campbell. I bet that was educational. Actually, it was. He's not that bad once you get past the jock stuff. He asked about you. Yeah, I got some goofy e-mail from him. You didn't like it? I mean, uh... did you write him back? You didn't like it? I mean, uh... did you write him back? - Be serious. - Why not? You haven't been on a date in forever. You think I enjoy asking you to prom? Hanging out with you and the guys every weekend? - I thought you liked hanging out with us. - Yeah, some weekends. Some. Okay, then e-mail him. Why not send him the famous Maggie Carter soul quiz? That would be good for a laugh. Maybe. But maybe he'll ace it. Then you won't have to spend another miserable weekend with me. Then you won't have to spend another miserable weekend with me. You know what I meant. Yeah... I know. Good morning. What's up? You guys get dressed in the dark? It's mismatch day. Maybe I should go home and change. You and Ashley grant... I think that's your mismatch. You and Ashley grant... I think that's your mismatch. Opposites do attract. Thanks, cosmo. Probably not that opposite. Hey, Brian, Carter sent me like this midterm, you know? Questions. I know. It's a soul quiz. It's movies, books, music. If you pass that, you're a new man. Famous. Of course, there is one small hitch. You do realize Ashley grant hates me. Clear the pool! Man, she doesn't hate you. She's confused by you. Man, she doesn't hate you. She's confused by you. She's trying to act like she doesn't care, but, believe me, Brian, she cares more than you think. She just can't figure you out. It's driving her nuts. You're this "new guy" Brian, who's not into her for some reason. - But I'm not Brian. - Hey, Brian. - Hi, Brian. Hi. There they are! Step off. What a doofus. You girls are hot. What's up, dudes? Who's the gerbil? I'm Floyd. You know, Ryan's friend. The chicks want me. See you. The chicks want me. See you. Come on. You got a soul quiz to take. Do you want to see what I'm writing? No, just make me look good. Not too cocky. Is everything okay? The last book he read was nine stories. Salinger. Wow. It gets worse. Salinger. Wow. It gets worse. The Beastie Boys, the eels and old cheap trick. He aced it. Movies? Stripes, Casablanca and anything by monty python. That's great. No, it's not. It's horrible. Chris Campbell. Maggie, it's not that bad. "Not that bad"? Man, he's gorgeous. What am I gonna do? - After tonight's double date? - Not a chance. Why not? Because as far as I can see, there is nothing special about this person. Why not? Because as far as I can see, there is nothing special about this person. That's what he said about you. He did not. I'm serious. He said those things. He really likes you, okay? It's just one date. Trust me. Trust me. Hello. When any chick goes on a talk show with her fiance... And has a deep, dark secret, has it ever been anything other than "I'm really a man"? Your fiance invites you on TV to tell you something, she's packing sausage. Come on, man. I gotta get ready. I know. Listen, that's why I'm calling. Be careful tonight. Maybe pat her down before you get in the car, just to be sure. Maybe pat her down before you get in the car, just to be sure. - I've got another call. - So what? Let it go. It might be Chris. Inbreed! - Hello? - I'm sorry, Ryan. I can't do this. - I'm calling Chris. - What? Maggie, you have to. It just doesn't feel right. What doesn't feel right? He passed the soul quiz. Ryan... Maggie, i need your help. No, you don't. You're gonna be fine. Sorry. - Yeah? - What kind of mongrel leaves a guy on call-waiting? Floyd, I gotta go. Cosmo says to check for an Adam's apple, all right? - Talk. - Hey, Chris? - That's me. - Hey, it's Maggie. - Hey, Maggie. - Listen, I'm calling you about tonight. Yeah, yeah... can you hold on one second? - Yeah. - Okay. Talk. - Maggie's gonna call you. Don't answer. - I already did. Shit. She wants to cancel the date. The soul quiz? She liked all that stuff. I don't know what happened. - Maybe she's nervous. - Nervous stomach? - Yeah. - Yeah, probably the pill. Put me on hold, and I'll try to talk you through this. But keep coming back to me, okay? Let's start with... "I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight. We seem to have a lot in common." Yadda-yadda. No, I don't think "bitch, we had plans" will work. Hold on. Maggie? Sorry about the wait. It's cool. So... Great. Now that's my other line. Can you hold on a second? What happened? Oh, my God! Your mom fell down the stairs! What happened? Oh, my God! Your mom fell down the stairs! - What? - Mrs. Carter, are you okay? Chris, can I call you back? Talk. I just bought us a few seconds. Dude, you let her go. She's not going. She is going. Tell her you need to talk to a friend tonight. - Why? - You're depressed. Your grades suck. - Your father's on crack. - My dad played pro football. - Perfect! - You're getting your ass kicked for that. I don't know what your problem is, Ryan. I don't know what your problem is, Ryan. Okay, she's back. Now, don't screw this up. Hold on. Hello. Sorry. Sorry. Hello? Chris? Chris, are you there? Y-yeah, I'm here... Baby. Are you okay? 'Cause you sound kind of different. Yeah, well, um... Oh, yeah, see, um... Yeah, well, um... Oh, yeah, see, um... The battery's running low on my wireless, so I have to put you on speaker. - Can you hang on? - Okay. Just a second. Okay. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Yeah, sort of. Listen, I hope you're not sick. Well, you know... I'm sick about this not happening. Well, you know... I'm sick about this not happening. I mean, I know I'm a jock.

I don't usually talk this way, but, uh... I don't usually talk this way, but, uh... I think being with you wouldn't be irrelevant. You know what I'm saying? Or maybe I should just stop with all this weak shit. - No, it's nice. - Oh. All right. So let's do this, huh? You know? No pressure. We'll go hang out, the four of us, get to know each other. - We could talk, maybe... - Swap some spit. - We could talk, maybe... - Swap some spit. - Okay. - Famous! - What? - I said, uh, thank you.
