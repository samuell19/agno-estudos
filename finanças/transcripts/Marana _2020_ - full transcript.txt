Donkey. Chapter 1 The Forest Fuck. You won. Did I? You did. Congratulations. You won with a little stick, man. You should be a swordsman! Now it’s my turn. MMA! Taekwondo! Catch it. Stop. I have my phone in this bag. I'm going to win, man. I'm winning. How about that? K.O. I have such a back pain. One, two, three… Let’s see who wins. Dear friend, I love you. You can’t open it, it’s closed. Pipes, wood, chairs… A table… This is Charlie’s, isn’t it? Yes, it is. Let’s check it out. We’ll cut the grass here… We’ll make some beautiful decorations. - Everything is run-down. - Slowly, it’s collapsing. It is so fucked up. We’ll have to fix everything. You know what? We will not use wood but… … iron, man. Mirko, we’ll have to tide everything up here… … and there too. I’m a good man and so are you… … but you have no taste in clothes. And stop smoking! Otherwise, you’ll not turn 60. Slowly, slowly. Have a look inside. Get down and look how beautiful it is. - Have you seen it? - Yes. We just have to renew it a bit. Let’s do it in 201.. … Not in 2019, I’ve got too many things to do… Let’s do it in 2020, man! Think about it. We can renew it all. Can you light me a cigarette? We can move that building over there or we can make it a hotel. You know it’s for sale, right? A hotel! Look: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ... 16… 16 rooms. We’ll make 24 then! We will cover it with gold. And here we’ll write 1855 and we’ll put a crystal on it. We’ll have to change those rusty irons, so cool man! Thanks, bro. Sit down, here. Where were your parents from? - From Venice. -Were they born in Venice? -Yes. Why don’t I see them often? Because they don’t have a car. Rumor has it that your parents abandoned you… … but I don’t believe it. My step-father is an asshole and I couldn’t care less about him. One day I want to become an artist… … a famous singer. It’s been my dream since I was a child. Everyone told me: “You have a bad voice”. That’s why I trained to improve it. “Max Divine”… My friends started to call me “Max” and I added “Divine” as my stage name. I want to be like Justin Bieber… … he started singing other people’ songs. Then Usher found him and that’s how he became famous. I was walking on the road when I saw it the first time and everything changed on my mind I saw a young boy dying on the road and everything changed on my mind. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I feel so bad… I feel so good, and bad and bad and bad for those boys dying on the road yet today… and every second... every moment… every hour… every second… I haven’t finished the lyrics yet. Can you give me a cigarette? Give me a cigarette! -I’m coming. -Max! Can you play a slow one? Slow. Baby girl, every second, every day, I dream about you in the night. I look at the sky, the stars. And I say: “What have I done?”. And I think about you every day. In the sky, I say baby girl. Baby girl, I say baby girl. Baby girl, I say baby girl. Baby girl, I say... Chapter 2 The house Sit down. Now look over here. Ok. Now Iet’s take a portrait. Look over here. Enea, what’s that? Valentine! Very good. Ok, done. Giorgia… Giorgia! Giorgia! What's going on? Let’s go. Giorgia. You can't stay here. Go away. Federico, no! Get up. What’s wrong? - Shoes. - Go to take them! Let’s go outside. Come on, get up. Now behave yourself. Water. Open your mouth. Let’s get you dressed. Chapter 3 The sea Nice, bro. Little baby... Baby... Baby.. Come here baby. Little baby.. Come on! Grandma told me that I am a special boy. She told me that I can do a lot of thing if I wanna. My grandfather told me that I could be a better person. Today I dress up and look where I am now. But if I go out in the world look where I'll be. I’ll be a superstar one day and one night I’ll be a special star.
