Hi, you've reached Sebastian Laurent with Dash Creative. I'm off creating. Leave a message. Clearly, I haven't reached Sebastian Laurent with Dash Creative. We were supposed to meet here in the office to go over our research for the pitch meeting. Where are you? Leave a message. Sebastian, where are you? The client is already seated. Am I supposed to do this pitch alone? Please just call me back. Anna. Where have you been? Are you kidding me? I was literally at the office doing all the markers... Relax. I was doing market research, too, from our market. Several, actually. I had to go to a few stores to find all the flavors. Here, try this. No, they're literally waiting. And the clients are going to want to see that we know their product. Quick, drink. OK, now try orange. Not bad. OK? Yes. OK, let's go. Don't forget your tote. Don't forget your broomstick. What do you got for us? And why shouldn't we stick with our current agency? Well, first of all, have you thought about changing the name of your brand? He's joking. Please, they think you're serious. OK, we keep it. Um, the beauty of Fizzarup Soda is that it's all natural, non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan. Parents can feel good about it, and the kids don't need to know that it's good for them. The 12 to 19-year-old age range makes up the largest consumption of soft drinks in America. We really don't feel like you're tapping into that market. We have algorithms that analyze... Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. Bubbles. Have you seen those giant plastic balls filled with air, the ones that you can jump inside and roll around in? Yes. Yeah. My daughter had them at her pool party. We open on a group of teenagers at a lake. They are bored out of their minds. They take a drink of Fizzarup Soda, and then suddenly a helicopter swoops in, drops the balls out of the sky. They jump into the lake, run into the water, and jump inside. At the end, they morph into tiny, floating bubbles. Find your fizz with Fizzarup. I love it. That's bold. Also very expensive. I mean, the insurance alone on that would... I'm sorry... It does sound expensive, Sebastian. As you know, we're a smaller startup. You can't put a price on a great concept. Well, I mean, actually, you can. We can come up with a different idea. Yeah, like what? Well, like something with a feasible budget, a campaign that I can actually deliver. OK. We will find something. We are never going to set ourselves up for success if you keep overpromising to the clients. You saw the way their eyes lit up. They'll find the money. Sebastian, I'm your account manager. The client comes to me if something goes wrong or for over budget. I need you to respect what I do. I'll see you at the office. He's not a team player, Caroline. I am concerned that you are not embracing your creative side. Remember when you first started, you were not afraid to speak up, veer out of your lane if it made an idea better. No, I can do that again. Have you heard of Durand Diamonds? Yeah, of course. They're huge in Europe. Exactly. Now they want to be huge in America. We're in the running for the account. I'm sending you to Paris. Oh. You heard me right. I said Paris? Oui. Yeah, I love everything French... The toasts, the manicures. They're great. Oh, how do we hear about this? I happen to know Louis and Marianne Jerome from back home. They reached out. This is a top priority for them and Dash Creative. Pack your bags. You leave tomorrow. I'm sorry, what? Together? Well, I still think you have the potential to be a great team. You know, I really feel like you should send Margaret for this. She'd be great. Anna, you're reliable. You're a problem solver. You keep the trains running. I want you for this. Perhaps Anna could keep the trains running in New York. We have a lot of them here. The way I see it, you're going to teach Anna to color using all the crayons in the box again. And Anna, you're going to show Sebastian how to color inside the lines. Now don't let me down. I'm sorry, what was that? I said, I can't wait to work together. Hello? Hey. Lily, did I wake you up? Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, I need to be up in, like, three hours anyway. What's going on? Well, I'm coming to Paris. Oh won't you I thought you said you were never coming back here. I mean, it's for work. We're trying to land the Durand Diamonds account. Nice. When do you get here? Tomorrow. I'm like totally freaking out. Yeah, no, babe. I don't blame you, but when you land the account and you're the big hero at work, you can finally put Paris back on your map. I miss you. Can't wait to see you. You, too. Call me when you land. OK. Love you, buds. So when was the last time you were in Paris? It's been about three years since I started at the agency. How do you know the Laurents? My family's department store carries their jewelry. Really? Which one? Laurent. Laurent like as in your last name Laurent? I did not know that. Yeah, my brother runs the business. I used to be the VP of marketing. It was actually my favorite store when I lived in Paris. Well, my favorite window store. I could never actually afford anything in there. Yeah, I noticed you had a pretty good accent. Thank you. I studied at the Sorbonne. You're full of surprises. Have you had a chance to look at the research packet yet? Where's our car? You know, it's crazy to think that America is responsible for half the sales in the world's jewelry. Research is the enemy of creativity. That's a little harsh. I already know the Durand brand. No, you know the Durand brand in Paris. We have to tailor it for America. Do you have any ideas? For me, inspiration hits when I least expect it. Ah, there's our car. The rosé diamond. 17 carats. Flawless. It was designed by Bernard Durand. His nephew Louis now runs a business. He's known as the "king of diamonds." Well, here comes the queen. The rosé can be yours for $23 million. We already know the color is perfect for you. Oh, merci. Does it come with a set of matching bodyguards? Anna Bowman, Dash Creative account manager. So nice to meet you, Anna. And Sebastian. Come, Louis will meet us in the showroom. We must apologize for the short notice. But we've been pitched by three American agencies, and [laughs] they haven't worked out. We are trying to beat our biggest competitor to the US market. Ah, yes, Tropez Diamonds. Oui, Tropez Diamond. And then it hit me. I remember that you went away to work in New York, Sebastian. You always understood our brand so well. We think you could be the perfect fit. Merci. Your parents, are they well? Um, they're fine. Good. I'm so sorry about what happened at the store. Let's remind your father how brilliant you are with a great campaign for Durand. He and your mother are coming to the charity gala next weekend. You both should come. Oh, unfortunately, we are only here for a few days, but thank you. So you have a pitch already? We do. You're going to love it. Well, great. Do you know Paris, Anna? Yes, yes, I love it here. I actually... I haven't been back, um, since our honeymoon. No, you two are married? Oh, I... I mean... I always feel that a couple who work together bring something so special. I am so happy. Your parents never said anything about a wedding, Sebastian. Uh, they, um... they, um... They don't know. Ah. Say no more. Maria and I have been running the business together for 30 years. How long have you been together? Uh, yeah, it's actually our one-year anniversary. Yes, it's been a whirlwind. Yes. Where was the wedding? Las Vegas. The courthouse. Where? It was at the Las Vegas courthouse. Well, this trip cannot just be about business. You two need to relive the magic of your Paris honeymoon. We don't. Where are you staying? Um, the hotel at the convention center. No, [speaking french]. I am going to get my assistant to find you a room at the Lux. It is where we are hosting the gala. Please, we... We would love to stay there. Great. Excuse me, Anna. I notice you are wearing your ring as a necklace? And no wedding band either of you. Oh. Yes, well, it's embarrassing. My fingers are swollen from the airplane. And I lost mine right down the drain. Well, you've come to the right place. What just happened? What were you thinking? Me? You're the one who said "our honeymoon." You said "our anniversary" and then you told them they were going to love a pitch that we don't even have yet. And then I saw... Saw what? I don't want to talk about it. Well, I hope that diamond around your neck fits on your finger. Else, we need to find a bubble gum machine with a ring to fit. This was my grandmother's ring. She was French. She's the reason I love this city so much. You know what? No, I'm not doing this. You're going to tell them the truth because this is wrong. Or else I'm going back to New York today. Look. Look, this is what we'll do, OK? We'll give them an amazing pitch. And after they fall in love with it, we'll tell them it was a misunderstanding. Everybody wins. We literally have no ideas yet. With diamonds, you just need to think big. Think models dripping in diamonds, scaling the Eiffel Tower. Sebastian, the greatest ad campaign in history was a diamond is forever. It was simple. Great, it's Caroline. No, I can't do it. I'm sorry. Please. Please just... Caroline, bonjour. Sa va? Sebastian? Where's Anna? Anna? She's, um... she's in the toilet. OK. How's it going? Very well. They're liking your ideas? Very much. That is a lot of very's. Is it Anna? She's stifling your creativity? No. Anna's smart. She's been great. OK, good. Keep me posted. Au revoir. Wow, stifling your creativity? She doesn't think I can do this. So show her you can. So are you in? Fine. Pardon? Fine, yes, fine. The next time Caroline calls, I'm doing market research, not on the toilet. This is very bad karma. You were great in Legally Blonde, by the way. Passports, please. Merci. Madame Durand's assistant called. We have the honeymoon suite all ready for you. It's a honeymoon suite? Is it possible to make that into two rooms, please? When you see the romantic room we have for you, all your troubles will melt away, vanish in the wind. Did you hear that, ?? That sounds wonderful. Merci. My little cabbage? It's a term of endearment. Merci. Come on. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Mm, delicious. You don't snore, do you? Quickest honeymoon ever. No, you don't have to open that. Oh, relax. Live a little. Stop and taste the bubbly. Now that the client thinks that we're married, what's your big idea? Well, we'll just have to get to know each other. No. Maybe not. You can tell me about your favorite color, your favorite dessert. You can tell me all about your paperclip collection. And then maybe we can reminisce about our first date. I suck at lying. I get really hot, and my face turns red. And I don't know. Maybe we could just tell them that we broke up or something. What, you mean like a fake-up? Yes! No way. You know, what's up with you anyway? What was that Paris honeymoon you were talking about? I used to be married, and then... I don't know... today, I thought I saw my ex-husband at Durand. You were married? When? Two years ago, but it only lasted a year. What happened? You are just, like, prying a lot. Well, we're married now. We have no secrets. I thought I was in love. So I got married very quickly. It's just, it wasn't me. Oh? Yes, being back here just reminds me of what an epic failure that was. Anna, divorce doesn't mean you failed. Look at you. You're pitching on a huge account, flown across the world, trusted with one of the biggest gets Dash might have this year. Believe me, I know what it is to fail. That's why we need to knock this pitch out of the park. What about Paris Rocks? Eh. Sounds like a bad '80s band. What about Paris Eternal? Sounds like you're selling tickets to the catacomb. You know what? I need to clear my head. Let's, um... let's get some rest, huh? Yeah, my head is pounding. Definitely jet lagged. You know, my grandmother used to say, [speaking french]... Favorite color is blush pink. I like black raspberry ice cream from back home. And my perfect date would be a walk on the Alexandre III Ugh. So gross. Morning. Peace offering. I'm sorry. All of this has just put me out of my comfort zone, so. I've hit a bit of a wall myself. Anything come to you in your dreams? Oh, yeah, I was fired in two languages. But luckily, we get three hours to figure all of this stuff out. Shall we? Bonjour. Marianne. Sebastian, bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour, hi. Bonjour. Gabriel. Sebastian. Long time. Gabriel works for France's top ad agency, Idé. Hm. He's a drones ad exec here in Paris. This is Anna Bowman. Nice to meet you, Anna. You, too. Gabriel is going to consult on the American campaign. Oh. Yes, I told Marianne, Louis, my agency can handle the launch ourselves, but they insisted on an American agency taking the lead. You know the American market? We have a few international clients, yes. And rest assured, we have many great ideas ready to go. Like? Well, the American agencies get so wrapped up in proposals. We want to promote more than the classic engagement ring... Anniversaries, birthdays, Valentine's Day. Durand Diamond makes any event special. And that approach has worked for us like a charm here in Europe. Well, you don't want to underestimate the power of the proposal. We spend $30 billion a year on engagement rings. That's more than any other country. I would say saying yes is all about the four c's... Color, cut, clarity, and, of course, carat. Yes, and let us not forget the fifth C... See how fast she can post it on social media. Little bit gauche, don't you think? 60% of American women say that they've posted their engagement ring within the first 24 hours and nearly 90% within the first week. That is a promotional gold mine. You can only make a first impression once. I would say go with what works. Come. Let's hear your pitch in the office. We see an American couple at a romantic picnic with champagne in front of the Eiffel Tower. He gives her a pink box and reminds her that it's been one year since their first date. Yes, and with anticipation, she opens this box. Inside, some macarons. She's not overly impressed, so he gives her another box. A little beret. Again, not impressed. But this time, he gets down on one knee and presents a tiny box. Her face lights up to reveal a dazzling Durand Diamond engagement ring. Give your love a piece of Paris. Durand Diamonds. I'm not sure it really captured the essence of the brand. It's a little predictable. Yes, it's a little... How do you say... Pedestrian. And you're... how do you say... an... We can come up with something better. Yes, and if you don't, my agency will be happy to take over the campaign. I'm sorry, but I have to run. Marianne, I will see you this evening at the gala. Of course. Louis. I'll walk you out. So, Andre at the hotel, he told my assistant you had a little tiff. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. It was nothing. She was, oh, as they say in America, hangry, weren't you, my love? Yes. Yes, I was. Well, sometimes relationship can be difficult. Oh, no, no, we are good. We are burning. We're burning up. We are burning up. Why don't you take some time to explore the city to breathe in the romance and the essence of Durand? I'm sure it will give idea for the campaign. We're... She's right... We'll stay as long as you need, madame. Good. Then you can come to the gala as my special guest. It's perfect. Perfect. Oh, and I want to hear all about your love story, every detail. Every detail... Are you kidding me? We're here for a few days. Just relax, OK? I never took you for a photographer. Oh? I mean, I guess I kind of fell into it. I used to help my mom and dad with their old print shop back in Ohio or take photographs of local ad campaigns. So that's how you got into advertising? Yeah. Love is the one thing we all have in common in this world. Well, that and heartbreak. It's a bit cynical, no? I guess. A beautiful new life. Or the beginning of the end. See, the thing is, when we're little, we're promised this fairy tale, but what we're not promised is a happy ending. Well, we won't share that with Durand. I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. Thank you. Honestly, I never thought I'd be back in Paris as a married woman. Well, with so charming and handsome a husband, you may never want to let him go. Wow. All right, Prince Charming, where to next? This, I miss... The streets of Paris, the way the light shines and beams. It sparkles. It is magnifique. OK, let's focus. What is our pitch? Anna, please, this is how I work. Let your imagination go free. OK, I get that you want to daydream about a sparkly street, but we really do have deadlines, and I take those very seriously. Anna, all right. It's a process. You're too uptight. Wow. Well, you know, you're too undisciplined. Can't you let yourself loosen up, even for a moment? To be outrageous, to have fun, to let yourself think? I have fun. You see him? You're like that. You're stuck in a box. I'm not stuck in a box. Yes, you are. The deadlines, the schedules... it's boring. I enjoy my life. I have fun. Oh, really? Yes. Prove it. Prove what? What are you doing? I'm having fun. Please, no, stop. Please stop. This is so embarrassing. I'm leaving. Set your inner child free. No, I'm leaving. Bye. Or have you forgotten what she looks like? I'm not leaving until you get up here. Oh. I'm not doing that? Tres bien. Ready? Yes. Ready? OK. Oh. No, no, no. Oh. No, no, no, no. Stuck in a box. Anna, take it seriously, OK? Tres bien. I'm sorry. OK, we gotta go. Ah, da-da-da. Thank you. Oh. Tres bien. I told you I can have fun. I'm an excellent mime. OK, OK, now it's time to focus. I'm always focused. I'll have a chai tea latte, three pumps, skim milk, light water, no foam, 120 degrees. Merci. I will just have another tea. Merci. Does anybody ever get that order right? OK, um, I know that we could do a little butter... Better. I'm sorry, you just... you know that there are already 27 layers of butter on a croissant, right? 27 layers of heaven. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, she looks really sweet. That's how you conduct research. You observe. You take it all in. You have a real eye for this. Did you know that one in 500 proposals happens right here in Paris? And of course, a lot of them at the most popular spot, the Eiffel Tower. Well, it's the best view. These are my grandparents, Harold and Claudette, who were engaged here in Paris. It was right after World War II. And, well, he was an American soldier. She was a French seamstress. You look just like her. Beautiful. Any chance you'd like to have dinner tonight? I know this great spot in the Latin Quarter, great wine and great people watching. Anna! Research. Hi! Anna! Sebastian. Anna, hi! Lily! Hi! Oh, it's good to see you. This is Sebastian. Lily, this is our creative director. Nice to meet you. Enchante. Here, sit down. I got your rescue text, but you seem great. Wow. Rescue text? Thanks for that. Yes, it's... I just figured with everything happening with the hotel, it would just be better if I stayed with Lily. What if Marianne finds out? She won't. This is a bad idea. I'm sorry. What's going on? Look, it's kind of a crazy story, and I will explain everything later. But basically, the Durands think that we are married. Oh. And now we have a week to come up with a brilliant idea. OK, well, let me know if you need my help. I run the social media for chic we make designer gear for all of Europe's most pampered pooches. Here, I'll show you. Puppy couture, encrusted collars. Wow. Isn't that beautiful? Mm-hmm. And then... oh, paw-fume. Well, it's a dog's life. That's funny. He's funny. Do you want something to drink or eat? Sure, yeah, what are you having? Don't ask. 27 layers of heaven. OK, I will see you in the morning. Monsieur, hello. Oh, hello. Marianne's here. Marianne's here! Anna, are you going somewhere? No. Here you go. Hm? Lily. Mm! Oh, thank you. Thank you for my suitcase. Mm-hmm. Hi. I'm Lily. I'm Anna's friend from America. Enchante, Lily. She's checking in today at the hotel. Well, since you are in Paris, you must come to our gala. I would love to, Madame Durand. Merci. Anyway, yeah, I should go. I'm going to leave the keys at the front desk, OK? OK. I believe the front desk is that way. Of course it is. Thank you. Thank you, guys. OK. Well, how are things going? Well... It's wonderful. Great. Wonderful. I mean, today, we learned how to mime. Yes, it was... Oh, that's wonderful. I am so happy you are enjoying second honeymoon. You are married, Sebastian? They are celebrating their first anniversary. Well, we don't want to keep you. No, we have a meeting. But I am very excited to hear your ideas. Now will you listen to me? I didn't know she was... Hello, my favorite couple. Oh, you look terrible. Have you thought about a couple's massage? You know what? I think my beautiful bride could use one. She needs to relax. Actually, we have a lot of work to do. Right, honey? And what about our lover cake for lovers? Chocolate fixes everything. We're not... Delicious. Send one up. Consider it delivered. Mm. You're just really milking this thing, aren't you? I would. Like I'm going to turn down chocolate. Come along, my love. So what's the deal with that Gabriel guy? He seems so... I don't know... prickly. Oh, he's like a cactus. He's always been competitive with me. His firm's had my family's account for years. And when I was VP of marketing, we used to butt heads on everything. What happened with the department store? I mean, Marianne said something about your parents, and it just... Well, Laurent has always been a French icon. But it was struggling to attract young customers. Well, I wanted to take it into an edgier direction, show my father I could make a difference with my ideas. So what happened? Well, it backfired literally. There was a fire. Sorry, I shouldn't laugh. I just... what? It's never to be spoken of again, but my brother and my father blamed me, and rightly so. Is that why you moved to New York? Not right away. My father stepped down a year later. He asked Marcel to run the company. Said he was the responsible one. So I went to New York, far away from my family. You probably already know this, but you're really good at what you do. Thank you. Ugh. Call it a towel rack for a reason. They make it look so easy, don't they? Well, if it's right, it should be easy, no? Coming from the single man. No, it's not as easy as faking being married. I'm not even sure I want to get married. Why? You'd be tied down, not to mention the family can let you down. Oh, that sounds familiar. You're comparing me to your ex? Yes, I am. You both use towels as carpets and toothpaste as finger paint. I don't understand. If it was so wrong, why did you get married in the first place? I don't know. We just kind of fell into the romance. I mean, it wasn't love. It was definitely just lust. You said yes, huh? Yeah. Where was your research? Oh, my research. Uh, yeah. I don't know. He definitely didn't fit my dating algorithm. Seriously? Yeah. Well, it's an app. Wow, do not judge. If you were to propose, how would you do it? I'd have my Durand Diamond engagement ring in my hand, of course. Of course. Yeah, of course. I would get down on one knee. I would... Oh, we're doing this. OK. I'd tell you how crazy you make me, which you do. Mm. And I'd tell you how I haven't been happier in a long time. And... and then I'd quickly come to my senses. I'd break out into a cold sweat. Oh! Sorry. I'm so sorry. No, that's... I'm so sorry. That's fine, really. It was... Because it was just an accident. You did not just do that. I did. Merci beaucoup, huh? Merci beaucoup. When in Paris. I told you, being married sucks. Thankfully it's not actually Paris Fashion Week. Marie Antoinette would be rolling in her grave. She would be. I'm going to get this. Another epic proposal. Yes, Paris, home of the cliches and berets. Hello? Is Sebastian there? I'm sorry, who's this? Sebastian's mother. Hi. Um, he's doing market research. Oh, please, could you tell my son I expect him home in the morning tomorrow? Yeah, of course. Yes, I can. Um... Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. I will let him know. Well, I'm looking forward to meet you, and see you tomorrow. Sebastian! Hey? Um, your mom just called the hotel room, and she wants to see you and me tomorrow. Maman? Yes. Do you think she knows about our marriage? Gabriel. He must have told my brother. Him and Marcel are friends. OK, OK, you know what? This is good. Tomorrow you'll go to your family's house. You'll work things out. And I'll just get work done. Da-da-da. You're coming with me. No. Yes. We're married. Time to meet the parents. Sebastian? Lucie. Bonjour, Sebastian. This is Anna. Bonjour, Lucie. Bonjour, Anna. Sebastian! Maman. Anna, welcome. Hello. So you met at the agency? Well, Anna is my account manager. Yes, I am. Oh. Merci, Lucie. Your son is very talented. I hope you have... What is it called... 911 on speed dial. Jacques. So something you want to tell us? You are married. Yes. Gabriel told your brother. Of course he did. It's a bit of a mix-up. A mix-up? Well, either you are married or you're not. We... we... We are. We are married, very married. That's wonderful. So how did you propose, Sebastian? Well, we got black raspberry ice cream, her favorite. It's delicious. And we went to the top of the Empire State Building. She had been wildly in love with me for months. Well, something I learned about Sebastian was that he is terrified of heights. I mean, just freaking out. I had to pull him out of the elevator. Children were laughing at him. I didn't know you were afraid of heights, Sebastian. But he's very much afraid of dolls. Dolls. You're afraid of dolls. Well, I was just nervous because I was about to make the ultimate commitment. Hmm. His other fear. But you should have seen Anna. She was totally... inflated, but puffy. She looked like... a clown, no? But then I told her that coming to America was the best decision I ever made because, well, it led me to her. We are so happy for both of you. Aren't we, Jacques? It seems America has been good for you, Sebastian. Congratulations. Merci, papa. I'm sorry. I could just feel the tension. So... No, you were just trying to help. I'm going back to America anyway. So it really doesn't matter what they think. I mean, it sounded like you guys were getting along. Based on a lie. We really need to get our story straight. I don't even know where you live. Park Slope. OK. You're in Chelsea, right? Yeah. What's your shirt size? Medium. Birthday? July 8, 1987. Oh. Looks like you've landed yourself a younger man. September 17, 1987. How do you say it in America? It's cougar? OK. Do you miss it? I idolized my father growing up, watching him run the store, always in control. Is Laurent why you decided to become a creative director? Absolutely. Everything about this place inspired me. What did your dad mean by 911? That was Marianne. She wants to see us right away. OK. Let's go. Tropez Diamonds, they plan to launch their American campaign before us. They want to... Steal our thunder, as you say in America. Fortunately, Gabriel has a friend in their company who heard about it at a party last night. Sorry I'm late. We want to launch the new campaign ahead of schedule. Oh. How ahead of schedule? Next weekend at the gala. That's in six days. Yes I thought we could invite the American press. It was my idea. Of course it was. It won't be the full campaign rollout. We just want to give America a taste of what's to come, mark our territory. Then we can decide if we'll proceed with your agency. But if it's too soon... Consider it done. Great. Perfect. I should have gone home. Relax. Some of my best ideas come to me under pressure. It's like the diamond process... Starts as ugly carbon beneath the surface, then after millions of years, it turns into the most beautiful substance in the world. Well, sir, we do not have a million years. We have less than six days. I didn't realize you got a video, too. It's spontaneous. Would you look at her light up at the sight of that ring? How did you feel when your ex proposed? My whole world stopped. It was real, even if it was just for a blink of an eye. What if we do a campaign centered around real life proposals that we capture? Here in Paris? Yes, with Americans. It would be cost effective. And special and unique. I am going stir crazy in that room, Lily. Why? Did something happen? Yes! He's messy. And he doesn't believe in alarms. Oh, and get this. He thinks that American women flaunt their wealth. Yeah, well, it is sort of a shameless new tradition. The ring selfie. But it sounds like he's getting under your skin. You know what that means. Oh, no, no, do not say it. You like him! Admit it. You like him. Ah, hello. Waiting for your better half? Hey, you know what? I'm going to call you later. Bye. Ciao. A little bit of sightseeing today? Yeah, kind of. We're looking for real life proposals for Durand's new ad campaign. Oh, but you know, you can't really swing a baguette without someone proposing in Paris, huh? Have you been to Alexandre III bridge yet? You know, I have. It's actually one of my favorite spots in the world. Oh, it's the same for me. Sir, your croissant with extra butter. Merci beaucoup. But you know croissant is already made out of butter. If I remember correctly, this is your idea of a perfect date, no? Yeah. I don't know. Being here reminds me of being in one of those old black and white French films with Simone Signoret and Yves Montand. They were like the power couple of French cinema. That was Simon's second marriage. Montand was her true love. No, I did not know that. So my mother wants us over for dinner tonight. Sebastian I don't know if I can keep doing this. What's one more dinner? You'll never have to see them again after the gala. Please? Fine. OK, super. Go, all right? Up a piece Don't drop me. I won't drop you. Don't worry. See, I didn't drop you. I'm so sorry to interrupt. Are you guys American? Uh, yeah. Ohio born and raised. I'm from Cincinnati. Columbus. Go Buckeyes. Yeah. We are doing an ad campaign for Durand Diamonds. Oh, mine's Durand. Yeah, I bought it here, and then I proposed at the Eiffel Tower. You guys, congratulations. We want to feature real couples. Would you mind if we ask you a few questions on camera? Of course. Sure. Merci. Thank you. It'll be quick. OK, so you guys are from Ohio. What brought you to Paris for your proposal? He knows I've dreamed of coming here since I was a little girl. Paris is the most romantic place on Earth. I want her to always remember that this is where our commitment to each other officially began. That's perfect. Thank you guys so much. Merci. Congrats. Thank you. Aw. Well, it's nice. Yeah. You know, you're really good with people. Oh, it's easy when you're in the middle of a real life romance novel. Hey, isn't this where your grandparents got engaged? I remember in the photo. Yeah. They had much better sense than I did. You know, for what it's worth, I think your ex was a fool. Thank you, Sebastian. Do you guys want me to take a picture of you? Oh, no, it's OK. Why not? Will you use my phone? Yeah. Come. Merci. Thank you. Sebastian! I think it's good. OK. Now can she dip me? No, we're good. No? Thank you so much. We're going to your parents' house. Bye. Here we go. So, tell us, how is the campaign going? Well, it's been interesting. Well, I just hope that you are keeping it simple. The Durands are very traditional. Oui, Papa, I just said. Did he tell you about what happened at the store with the fire? Please, Jacques. No, we can love about it now. Sebastian decided to recreate by carnival at Laurent complete with flamethrowers. The Coat Department caught on fire, and the sprinklers went off. The insurance company were not pleased. Millions of dollars in damage. And they'll never hear the end of it. Our clients don't need the fanfare. Sebastian's our top creative director because of those big ideas. And sometimes those big ideas lead to big headaches. Or sometimes they can take your breath away. Touché. Thank you for that tonight. I love my father very much, but our relationship is complicated. Oh, shooting for the stars is great, but sometimes it's OK to turn down the heat a little, too. Is that a reference to my flamethrowers? Yes. He's right. You're right. I do go too far sometimes. No. No, thinking big, that's what makes you, you. But I do feel like you should speak with your dad. I really feel like tonight lit a fire on your relationship. I'm sorry. I'll stop. Thank you. You're up early. Hey. Yeah, I just... I couldn't sleep. I just kept thinking about the campaign. When I used to help out with them on the pop shops back in Ohio, the most important thing to them was that their customers knew they were selling more than just a product, like something they believed in, that they put their whole lives into. What are you saying? Well, I mean, right now, it just kind of feels like we're selling a travel campaign. Why you should get proposed to in Paris, not why you should buy a Durand Diamond. I want to know the history of Durand, the lore of Durand, the quality. What makes them special? I have an idea. May we hear about the Rosé diamond? The Rosé diamond. Of course. The most rare piece in our collection. The stone was brought to us from India. Only .0001% of the world's diamonds are this color. It almost looks like there's a rose in the center. Would you like to try it on? Oh. No, I couldn't. But you must. Really? Wow. Voila. It matches your beauty, Anna. It's amazing. This ring never leaves the store, right? Uh, no. It's under heavy guard. We have bulletproof glass and a laser alarm system. Would it be totally out of the question to suggest displaying it? Yes. Yes, for the gala. We can introduce it to America, generate some buzz. Even better, you could wear it, Anna. But I don't even have a dress to the gala, let alone something to match this iceberg. Ah. Fortunately, Sebastian knows every designer in the city. Is Sebastian on his way? Yes, he just texted me. Something to drink, madame? Yes, a coffee, merci. And for Sebastian? Oh, he'll be fine. Thank you. But it's no trouble. What does he drink? We have everything here. Chai latte, three pumps, skim milk. Oh, and light on water, no foam, 120 degrees. Bonjour. So let's see this video. Paris is the most romantic place on Earth. I want her to always remember that this is where our commitment to each other officially began. So now you have it... Real couples, real proposals. I like it, but... It's missing something. OK. It's like a home video. It's provincial. Not pedestrian? Yes, that, too. I mean, it smells like cheap perfume hanging in the air. Marianne, we have the models ready. We have the fireworks ready to go for the gala. But I like that this is different. It captures Paris and our style, but it's lacking something intimate. Right. You have two days, OK? Otherwise, we have to go with Gabriel's plan. OK. What are we going to do? I don't know. But I can just see my father's face, another failure. Oh, you didn't fail. You put yourself out there, trying to do something unique. That's very sweet of you to say. I hope you don't mind, but I've planned a little surprise for you. Sebastian, what's happening? Well, you need a dress, right? Bonsoir. Bonsoir, Julianne. Welcome to Laurent. Merci. For the next two hours, consider us all your personal shopper. Whatever you need for the gala. Thank you so much. Thank Sebastian. Ah, it was all my mother, really. No more window shopping for you. Did you get everything you need? I did. Thank you very much. I got a little something else for you. I'm sorry it's only costume, but. It's beautiful. Can I try it on? Of course. Will you help me? Of course. Here, I'll let you take it. Merci. Here we go. Here is your tuxedo. Thank you. Ah, merci. Merci. Thank you so much. Good night. Merci. Oh. Hey. Hi. Good morning. Oh, perfect. Thank you. I was actually on my way to get coffee, so. You go. About last night, I... It was nice. I mean, don't you think we maybe got a little caught up? Is that so bad? Because we work together. Yeah, you have to start somewhere. Look at Marianne and Louis. Yeah, you know, I actually think you're on to something. Really? Yeah. Well, for the campaign. Yeah. Your love is what everybody wants. And that love is woven into every piece of jewelry you sell. We want to make your love story the center of the campaign. And if you like this campaign, we can post it online right after the gala. We love it. But can you get it finished in time? You have less than two days. Are you decent? If you mean James Bond decent, then yes. I don't know what that means, but oh, you look nice. You look like a million dollars. Well, I'm about to be $23 million, so. Marianne. Bonsoir, Sebastian. Bonsoir. Muah, muah. Oh, Anna, you look so stunning. Thank you. Oh, wow. Why do I feel like we're about to be arrested? Don't make jokes around the bodyguards. No sense of humor. Voila. Wow. I have one more thing for you, too... A thank you gift. Wedding bands. Um, no, we can't. We can't. Marianne... They are engraved with your name. I had to guess the size. I hope they fit. Let's see them on. Merci. Now, you are officially a married couple. Love is beautiful, and you two are glowing. Thank you. OK, now, let's go and introduce America to this diamond. You know what? I just need another minute to finish getting ready, so I will meet you downstairs. Of course. Thank you. You two, stay by the door. I'll see you out. Merci, Marianne. Merci beaucoup. Sebastian... I know, I know. But we agreed we would tell them the truth when this is all over. We can't ruin this for them. OK? OK. So after the presentation. Deal. I'm going to finish getting ready. Let's feature the encrusted collar. Yes, nice big smile. Oh, wow. That is big. I can't believe it's real. How does it feel to be wearing it? Incredibly fake, Lily. No, you deserve this, based on your ideas and your hard work, nothing else. Love you, buds. Love you. And have fun. Are you ready? I'm ready. Let's go. OK. Oh, my parents, 12 o'clock, and my brother. Hello. You look wonderful, Anna. Thank you so much for this beautiful dress. It's amazing. It's my pleasure. Bonjour, Anna. Marcel. Bonsoir. Nice to meet you. Wonderful. Marcel. Sebastian. It's good to see you. I'm excited to see what you've come up with. Congratulations. Yes, of course. Oh, sorry. Nice to see the Rosé on display. It's funny. I kind of feel like I'm going to turn into a pumpkin at midnight wearing it. Anna. Surprise. Bonjour, Anna. Caroline! You're here in Paris. Oui. I just couldn't help myself. You two sounded like you were having so much fun, and there's just so much on the line. I thought I should come and cheer on my best team. Plus, who can resist Paris? I mean, it's Paris. It's great. It's perfect. I am Gabriel Blanchett from the agency here in Paris. Enchanté. Nice to meet you, too, Gabriel. I'm Caroline, the boss. Boss. Perhaps I can offer you a drink? I'd love that. I can't wait to be dazzled by the presentation. Oh, yes. Absolutely. This is really bad. Relax. We have a plan. Everything's going to be OK. Is it? I promise. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Thank you. Bonsoir, everyone. We hope you're having a wonderful evening. Thank you for coming to the 20th annual Durand Diamonds gala. Thank you. Bravo! Tonight, we want to celebrate a very special announcement. But before we do that, we'd like to call up our ad team. Please welcome Anna Bowman and Sebastian Laurent. Woo! They're here from New York to help us launch a new endeavor. And Anna is wearing the Rosé diamond, which is so special to our family. Doesn't it look beautiful on her? So without further ado, after more than 100 years, as the premiere diamond destination in Europe, Durand Diamond is expanding into America. And now we'll turn the mic over to Anna and Sebastian for a special presentation. Voila. Merci. Merci, Marianne. Merci, Louis. Well, as they say in America, there's no better place to pop the question than Paris. And no better way to do it than with Durand. The brand is known for their history, romance. Their style, but not everyone can come to Paris for the perfect proposal. But now everyone can have a piece of Paris with Durand opening across major cities in America. We have prepared something for you to watch. So if you could, please. Merci. I remember proposing like it was yesterday. He took me to the famous clock behind the Musee d'Orsay. It was only natural since she kept saying the clock was ticking. I was taking too long to ask. I got down on one knee, and I proposed with a Durand ring I designed myself. Of course, the ring was perfect, but in fact, it was the look in his eye which captured me. He was usually so sure of himself. And yet, he was so unsure in this moment. Of course I was worried. Would she really agree to share her life with me? Would you see into my heart? I did. I do, just as you have always been able to see into my soul. That is what we put in every piece we make. Durand Diamond is about love, commitment, family. We help people to make timeless memory. Heirlooms of our lives together. Congratulations. You really captured the message for Durand. Well, it was all Anna's idea. No, it was teamwork. My instincts are always right. So are mine. So we're happy? I'll draw up the contract. I love these two and everything they represent. What exactly is that, Marianne? Gabriel, sour grapes never looked good on anyone. Of course. We need champagne to celebrate. Gabriel, come help me. Marianne, I really have to talk to you about something. What is it? You look so serious. It's... Marianne, [speaking french]. Ah, oui. We'll be back. No, no... Just five minutes. So it's quite a big night for your agency, huh? Honestly, I did not think that Sebastian and Anna could pull it off. I have to admit, there were times I doubted my decision to put them together. Really? I know, I know, but for better or for worse, it'll soon be over. And they love the campaign so much, they'll understand. OK. You should have seen them before they came to Paris. They were at each other's throats. Really? They don't like each other? I have never seen two coworkers with such opposite styles. Co-workers only? Ladies and gentlemen, if I may please have your attention. There is one more thing I would like to add this evening if that's OK with you. Since this evening we are here to celebrate love, I would like us to all please raise your glass and make a toast for a very special occasion. We are here to celebrate also the first year anniversary of Sebastian and Anna. Sebastian, Anna, please come to the stage. No, no, no. Please come to the stage, please. We're OK. Please, don't be shy. Come on. Thank you. So let us please toast to a life full of love, true love. Chin, chin. To true love. It's incredible that two people can work together and play together. What is your secret? Communication. What else? Anna, please. Let's just go. This isn't me. Please. I'm sorry. Um, we're not married. Marianne, Louis, I'm so sorry. You've been so good to us. And Durand is amazing and impeccable and respectable. And we lied... I lied. And that is not me, so I'm sorry. Anna. Anna. Anna, wait, please. Anna, wait. I'm sorry. It's over. Suffice to say, you no longer have the contract. Marianne, Louis... Was it not enough for you to burn down the store? You have disgraced our family tonight. When are you going to grow up, Sebastian? I'm sorry, Marianne and Louis. Sebastian, I could have died on the spot. Sorry, Marianne. Sorry. You're both fired. We, um... we will smooth things over. How? You convinced me to go along with this stupid lie. And we just lost everything. I lost everything. Not everything. How I feel about you, it's real. This isn't real. None of this was real! Well, for me, it was. Hi. I need to book a flight to New York. For tomorrow. Thank you. Well, you certainly got people talking. I am so mortified. Have you talked to Sebastian? Well, I said some things to him that were pretty harsh. And then I blamed him for everything when I was the one who got us into this mess. Do you like him? My heart says yes. But I can't make the same mistake twice. Well, I like to think of mistakes as little blessings. And if you're smart, which you are, you won't make the same mistake twice. And you already know in here if Sebastian is the right one. I've got to get to work. My star dachshund is such a diva. Are you going to be OK? Yeah. Yes, yes. Are you sure? I'm good. You need to go. Go. OK, but what time do you fly out? Tonight. I'll text you when I land. Oh, you again. Let me guess. Anna hired you to be her friend. No, no. You know what they say. The best things in life are free, like this water. Oh! I'm such a clutz. Have a nice day. Bonjour. Anna? I have nothing to say to you. I understand, but I am here to apologize for everything that happened last night. It was my fault. We find that hard to believe. No, this is true. Sebastian was just trying to protect me. He feels like you guys only see him for all the mistakes he's made, not for any of the good he's done. Did he say that? He loves you all so much. He's sorry for what happened last night and for everything that happened with your store. He's a good man. I really wish you could see what I see. Marianne. OK. Marianne. No! Marianne... No, Sebastian! No. We said everything we needed to say last night. I know. And I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart. I am. But, please, just don't blame Anna. Oh. She honeymooned in Paris with her ex and inadvertently said it was me. I convinced her to go along with it because I wanted the account so badly. And because I wanted redemption even more, it just... It snowballed. But Sebastian, you both lied to us. I know. I messed up. Yeah. And it has cost me everything. It caused me hell. So you really care for her? I do. I think I love her. Did you tell her? I don't think she'll ever see me again. Sebastian, no man ever won over a woman by thinking too much. You need to find her. Merci, Marianne. Merci. Hi. I am so sorry for what happened. No, Andre, I'm so sorry. Can I speak out of turn? Of course. For what it's worth, you two gave off a vibe that most married couples don't even have. What do you mean? Your connection was understated, but genuine. It was special. No. Thank you, Andre. I would really love to go for a walk. Is there any way you could watch my bags? Of course, mademoiselle. Whatever you want. I'll be back. Anna! Anna, wait! Sebastian? Anna, hi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got us fired. I'm sorry. No. I spoke to my parents. They told me what you said. Did everything work out? Things will be much better. And Marianne just called. She wants us back on the account. How? We were fired. We'll talk to Caroline. No, we should start our own agency. I'm serious, if you want to. I want to. Sebastian, it's beautiful. To celebrate us landing my family's account. Well, because they fell in love with your ideas. No, my love. It's because they fell in love with you. I have something for you. OK. Open? Please. Macarons. Pedestrian? A little provincial. Maybe this box. Mm. Thank you. Anna Bowman, pretending to be married to you was the best decision I ever made. You make me want to be a butter man. That's because I know how you like your croissants. I'm sure I want to hang up my towels with you every day for the rest of my life, no more pretending. I'm sorry. What was that? I need help with my French. Will you marry me? Oui. That was perfect. OK, when we first met, I really did not understand him at all. And I thought she was predictable. We had to go to Paris. For work. And pretend to like each other. We told people we were married. Oh, no, it was a horrible fiasco, really a terrible lie. Until it wasn't. That's because he fell for me. She couldn't resist my charms forever. No, you realized that you needed my good sense. It's true. You are my better half. And you are mine. And then this happened. It's so beautiful. Oui. A perfect expression of my love. Our love.
