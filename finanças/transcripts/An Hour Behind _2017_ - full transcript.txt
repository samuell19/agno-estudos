RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM What a week. My feet hurt. I think we made like 10 times more cupcakes than usual. That's a good thing. Hey what's this? - French Vanilla? - No, lemon blueberry. - For the competition? - Yeah. I can't believe they chose that Red Velvet cupcake over yours last year. I know, and I'm not letting that happen again this year, especially since they upped the prize to $30,000. Really? Nice. So do we get to try one of these? Yeah, just a second though, okay? Let me take a picture. Okay... one and... alright, yeah. Gimme! Yeah? Katie? It's good, it's really good. Good? I need great. I don't know if it's strong enough to win. It's like the frosting is too sweet or something. I like it. I don't know, I need to think about it. - Hello! - Hey Chloe. How's my favorite sister? You know you could have called, I haven't forgotten. Hey Dylan. - Hi, do you have any leftovers? - Oh yeah sure. Look, are you sure you haven't forgotten because ever since you broke up with Sam... I don't want to talk about it. You conveniently come up with reasons to avoid these dates. - That's because it's a blind date. - You'll love him. Oh yeah? Have you met him? Yes! He's Dillon's friend. He's cool. Yeah, 10 o'clock tomorrow. Right, at that restaurant with the horrible lasagna? Don't be so critical. It's breakfast, so you can avoid any pastas. I just don't understand why we can't eat here. Because all you have here is desserts. Besides, I know you. You'll end up working, just like you did with what's his name. Honey, what's his name? Mike. - It was fine. - It was a fiasco. We had no chemistry. - Tomorrow. - She'll be there. Yeah, I will. Hey Trish, are you okay if I take off? Sure yeah, I'll see ya on Monday. And don't forget to change your clocks because it's Daylight Saving's tonight. Oh yeah, is it an hour back or an hour forward? It's an hour forward. Yeah, it's spring forward, fall back. Oh yeah, that's right. - Okay, see ya. - Bye! - Hey, what was his name again? - Adam. Adam, Adam, Adam. He'll be wearing a green shirt and jeans. Okay. Got it. - Do you want me to write it down? - No, green jeans and a shirt. Okay. Oh, what? Come on. Okay. Hi, I'm Trish. Hi. I'm so sorry that I'm late. I worked really late last night and my alarm didn't go off, and then my cell phone is fried, so, technology, huh? Anyway, I'm just glad that you're still here. Me too. - So, have you ordered? - Not yet. What do you usually get? The omelet. I always get the omelet. Okay. - Are you sure that you're... - Hi, can I take your order? Yeah... I'll take the berry crepe, please, with some ham inside. - Ham? - Yeah, just chopped up a bit. Sure. And you sir? The... the Southwest Omelet. Thank you. What? Interesting choice. The ham and, no, I'm sorry, that's weird, I know. No, no, it's just that I've only seen that ordered by one other person. I thought I was the only one. So, tell me about yourself. What do you want to know? Well, Chloe says that you're a lawyer. Chloe? Did she make that up? It's so like her. Well, I... I deal with the medical side of things. Like malpractice, or an ambulance chaser kind of thing? Ambulance chaser is closer. Adam, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that. I don't mean to offend. Don't worry. You mentioned you worked late last night. - Yeah. - What do you do? I own a dessert bakery. It's called the Cupcake Palace. - On Fifth. - Yeah, you know of it? Right, I pass it a lot, I just haven't had a chance to go in yet. Then you should come in, Adam. - So, cupcakes, huh? - Yeah. They're not just pretty, they're delicious. Of course. - Don't doubt it. - I won't. - What about you, do you cook? - No. But, I am a great eater. - What's your favorite flavor? - Well, like chocolate or vanilla? Yeah, or dessert or... Anything chocolate and peanut butter. Oh that's a good choice. You got anything like that on the bakery's menu? Maybe. - You get half. - Thank you. Or you get a little more. She set you up with an IRS agent? Yeah, I don't know what my sister was thinking. The guy kept talkin' to me about how to be a small business and avoid audits. - It's thoughtful. - Yeah. Well, you can see my hesitation in meeting you then. I'm glad we met. Hey there's... - ...somethin' I should clarify... - Hey look! We should do that, that looks fun. Come on. Here ya go, and watch your step as you get in. - Have you done this before? - Yes, you? When I was a kid. You don't think that this is gonna tip over, do you? - No, only if you rock it. - No! Don't, don't! Where to? I don't know, it doesn't seem like it's that big. It's not that deep either. Aw, don't tell me you don't swim. I swim, I do, I just, I'm not a fan of murky water. Germs? Monsters? Monsters, yeah. That, snakes, and giant catfish. I don't think there's any giant catfish in here. Okay, so it's just snakes then that I need to be afraid of? Is that what you're saying, Adam? Frogs. Frogs, they they hide under lily pads - and then they jump at you. - What? - Yeah. - Okay. Alright, well, if a frog jumps at you, I'll make sure to scare it off. As long as you protect me from giant catfish. - Deal. - Good. Can I get some help paddling this thing? - I'm sorry. - Thank you. That was really fun. Yeah, it was. It'll be a first, but I'll have to thank Chloe for that. Me too. Okay, well, just so I don't have to go through my sister... Yeah, that's my number. Sounds good. Thank you, I really... I had a lovely day. So, I will see ya later, Adam. - Goodbye. - Bye. Parker. My name is Parker. - Hey, good morning. - Good morning. Are those already done? Am I late? Don't worry about it, I got it. Alright, well... I already added that. Usually, I put it in last. - Doesn't make a difference. - Okay. And I will get started on the chocolate croissants. Those are done. Yeah, they're cooling. Relax. Alright. - Trish, your sister's here. - Okay, coming. How was it? Don't you have anything else to do? Rick's at school, Dillon's at work. You should have called me anyway. It was nice. He was likeable. Finally. Come on, don't get crazy, alright? It was just one date. I told you he was great. Alright, you'll have to forgive me for being skeptical, but... ...yeah, he... he was. So? Is the interest mutual? I don't know. And you can not call him to find out. Why not? Because... this isn't grade school. We're adults, alright? Don't meddle. Promise me, Chloe. Fine. I promise. Hey honey. - Trish had a great time with Adam. - Well good. - Have you heard from him yet? - No. Can you call him? Honey, I don't wanna get in the middle of their... Call him so your sister-in-law can be happy. You wouldn't deny her a chance at happiness, would you? I don't know. I'll bring you two cupcakes. - Make it three. - Done. I love you. - Hey Dillon. - Hey, how's it goin'? Busy. Yeah, how was your weekend? I worked most of it, but I mean, I've got this case that just keeps burying me in motion after motion. Yeah sounds bad. Hey, how was your date? Chloe wants to know. - It could have gone better. - Really? - If she had shown up. - Wait, what? So, there I am, eating on my own when she just sits across from me and starts talkin' like she knows me, sort of. - You were eating alone? - Milo. Well? - Was she hot? - Very pretty. Forget pretty. Was she crazy? You know, at first I wasn't sure, but you know, she kept talking, and well, she thought I was someone else. - What? - There was something about her. Something. I got her number. - Nice. - Cool. And how embarrassed was she when she finally figured out who you weren't. Well, I didn't correct her. - What? - This gets better and better. She kept callin' me Adam. What, is that a middle name now? Look, I'll tell her, you know? It's no big deal. - You stood him up. - What? - Adam said you didn't show. - No, why would he say that? Be honest Trish. You did go, didn't you? I mean, you didn't feed me all that stuff about liking him and then not even go on the date? I met him. We spent most of the day together. You did? Yeah, I don't get why he would pretend that we didn't meet. Wait a sec, were you late? I mean, maybe a little, but not by much. Did you set your clock for Daylight Savings? No, my phone died, so I... You were late. Okay, even if I was late, I still met a guy there in a green shirt and jeans. Was this the guy? No. You guys don't think she'll be upset, do you? Why would she? You didn't do anything wrong. No, I mean, not really. Why didn't you just explain who you were? I don't know, I just... So what. It's her mistake. Big deal. Yeah, but she might not see things that way. You think? She'll be fine. Don't worry. All units, we have a code 10-45 at Second and Sullivan Avenue. Man in his mid 50s with chest pains requesting an ambulance. Unit 10-77 responding. I mean, what kind of guy just lies to you the entire time? I know. What was he doing? Laughing at me? See, yeah, this is why I don't like dating. I'm sorry Trish. You know, Adam is not like this. Real Adam. Yeah, I hope so. Trust my taste better than that. Was he mad at me? Yeah, a little. But, you know, I'll have Dillon talk to him, explain the whole thing and it'll be fine. I don't know, Chloe. I really don't wanna be dealing with this right now. Technically, you still owe him a date. Please? Stupid Daylight Savings. Well, you gotta love those false alarms. Yeah at least he was alright. And we got out of the station for a little while. Speaking of getting out, you're dating now? - I didn't mean to. - Yeah, but, still. - Good for you. - Gee, thanks. Hey there's her place. - Who, the girl? - Yeah, Trish. You wanna stop? Sure. You going as Adam or as yourself? I'm starving. What's good here? Does it matter? Guess not. Thanks. Hey Trish. - You. - Yeah. So, did you come here to confess? Looks like Milo was wrong. - Look, it's not what you think. - Really? Is your name Adam? Well, no, my name is Parker. Okay, well then, it's exactly what I think. You made me think that you were somebody else. No, you assumed I was this Adam guy. - But then you kept lying to me. - I didn't... People are looking. I didn't mean to lead you on, and I'm sorry you're embarrassed by the whole mistake. Embarrassed? For a mistake? I didn't know you thought I was someone else at first. - But you pretended to be my date. - But you sat down at my table. - Because I thought you were Adam. - Not my fault. Get out. Parker, maybe... Now, now, hang on. I wanna clear this up. No, I think I saw a food truck just around the corner. I'll order something here. Lemme see here. Chocolate croissant, hmm? Or a Peanut Butter Surprise. Can't lose there, sure. - Seriously? - Absolutely. Fine. Nice to meet you. I've got Adam's number. What? I just... already stood him up once. Inadvertently. - True. - Look, stop stewing about the imposter and meet Adam. He's a great guy. I just think it's all a little too... Do not say "too soon" because it's been over a year since you broke up with Sam. Too much. I was gonna say too much. It's too much. I need to be focusing on the bakery. Call him, Trish. Or I will. Hey, hey, no, no, no, fine. Fine. That's good. - Is that for your bake off? - It's not a bake off. Makes it sound so small time. It's a competition, alright, and if I win, that's $30,000 towards a second bakery. Either way it'll win points for the Adam. You know, as a little, "Sorry I can't figure out "Daylight Savings" gesture. So, I wanna apologize about the other day. Don't worry about it. How long were you waiting for me? Maybe... 45 minutes. 45, oh wow. That's not a good impression. How 'bout we pretend the other day didn't happen. - Okay, I'd like that. - Good. So, I was wondering, do you like plays? Yeah sure. I haven't really been to that many, but... Well, this is my niece's performance, so don't set the bar too high, but, I thought it'd be fun. Yeah, that sounds like fun. Great. Hey, how was training? Fine. What's that? Nothin'. I'm off. Hey, you got big plans tonight? Yeah, that's what I thought. Hey my last plans didn't go so well. Actually, they went great based on what you told me. So? Well, that's the first blip of life I've seen in you. Don't give up so easy. - So what'd ya think? - It was good. Your niece, she was great. I know it wasn't as traditional as say, dinner and a movie, but I figured you work in a restaurant all day, you probably want a break. Actually, I work at a bakery. So, we serve desserts and sweets, things like that. Interesting. So, not to contradict myself, but, I'm starved. - You wanna grab a bite to eat? - Sure. What sounds good? Anything but sushi. I'm sorry, I gotta take this. Yeah? Okay, what'd they come back with? That's crazy. No, no. No, there's no deal. Just tell them no. Alright... Yeah, I'll be right in. Okay. Sorry. - Work? - Legal emergency. Can we pick this up some other time? Oh sure, okay, yeah. Are you free Saturday? We can get that sushi. Yeah. You again. Me... Parker. I know. I just wanna be up front this time. - So, why are you here? - To see you. Workin' late? Yeah, I was just tryin' to catch up on some work 'cause I had gone on this date, so. Okay, okay, I just, I wanna explain everything. About why you lied? Technically, I just didn't correct you. Why not? Actually, I tried, but it never panned out. At first, I was so surprised, I mean, you just sat down and started talkin' to me. Yeah, but why didn't you just tell me later? We talked for hours. You should have told me the minute you realized what had happened. Well, I know that now, it's just, I don't know. I didn't wanna spoil it. Because there was something... ...different about you. That's actually really... ...that's really sweet. But, then I realize, that I really, I don't have a reason to trust you. I'm sorry, is there any way... No, you know, I'm just really busy lately. I've got a lot going on and... really the only reason we met was because of the whole time change thing. So, it's probably better if you just, you know, go and try to forget about me. Okay. I can not believe Parker came over again. - That was gutsy, huh? - Yeah. Anyway, how was your date with Adam? Hello? Yeah, it was, it was nice. It was fine. He's super charming, isn't he? Yeah, yeah, he's a real gentleman. So, what'd you do? We went to his niece's play. - Like, at an elementary school? - No, it was a theater of sorts. It was fine, it was fine. Great. Really kinda sweet, actually. Yeah... ...yeah. So? So, we have another date on Saturday. She is so aggravating. No matter what I say she still thinks I'm one of those guys. What guys? You know, guys like, you know, like Milo. Hey! Well, you know what I mean. Thanks. - What's wrong with me? - No, nothin'. It's just a predatory vibe you give off. Persistent. I prefer persistent, for the record. Actually, maybe you should be more like him. What? No, I don't mean mindlessly go after her. But, don't give up either. He's right. Mindlessly wasn't necessary, though. Really just depends on if you think she's worth it or not. I mean, after all, you're the one that had the fantastic date with her that breathed rhythm back into your heart. - That's... - That's not bad at all, is it? That's pretty good. What's with the flowers? I don't know. They were on the front doorstep when I got in. What's it say? "Roses are red, violets are blue, "if you give me a chance, I'll give you one too." - Well, that's kind of... - Lame? No, I was gonna say cute. Who's it from? No one. No. So, barring complications, I'll be made Senior Partner this year. That's awesome. Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? I think so. I mean, everything in college was about getting into law school. And after that, I joined a firm and haven't stopped. What about you? Always a chef? Actually, no, I was an accountant. - No. - Yeah. I didn't think you were that... - Business savvy? - Organized. Not because of the whole big late to our date thing. Yeah, sure, sure. Baking was always something that kept me interested, you know, growing up. I loved pushing all the buttons on the appliances, and my mom, she would always let me stir the batter. How's your sushi? It's, not my favorite. - Well, it's just... - I thought it was pretty fresh. - Here, try mine. - No, that's okay. - Just try a little bite. - Really, I'm really okay. - Just try a little bite. - You should probably... I'm full, I'm good. Thank you. Sorry, you were saying something about your cooking hobby. Right, right. I don't think I ever considered baking as a career. But you know, every tax season when things would get especially stressful, I would make myself take a break and I would start baking all these new things, and that's when I realized I just liked it so much better than crunching numbers. Who wouldn't? Excuse me, can we get another unagi roll? Yay. Flowers? What? Well, it's not enough. How do you know? - Did she call? - It's classic. Look, maybe it's enough if she already likes you, but that's not the case. Thanks. I'm just sayin' man, you gotta be charming. I am! I know you are, so, make her smile, laugh. Then, she can't stay mad at you. You missed a spot up there. All units, we have a code 242... He just got this look on his face and then he, he just fell. - How long ago did he fall? - I don't know. 10 minutes? Hey buddy, can you hear me? Pulse? Pulse is gone, I'm starting CPR. He's not breathing. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, - You okay? - Fine. Look, there was nothin' we could do here, you know? I know. I'm just sayin', you don't wanna internalize it. It'll eat you up. We should go. - Parker. - I'm fine. - What took you so long? - Sorry. I was... What's that? I have no idea. It was outside the door. What are you up to? Just cost analysis. You'd think that two stores would be more efficient than one, but no. Oh, my word. Have you been binging? No, those are left overs from the cupcake competition samples. - I was working on 'em all day. - Of course. So, when you win the prize money, is it gonna be enough for a second store? If I win, and no, it's not. But it'll be enough to get me started. What is that? "Sorry our signals got mixed up, Parker". Don't you already have one of those? Yeah. "Please don't toss me out. "See ya soon, Parker." Okay, I guess we have to give him points for creativity on that one. This one's my favorite. That one is the customer favorite. - Hi. - Hey. How are you? You got the gifts? Yes. - Good. - Yes. So, can I get you anything? Look... our short but turbulent history aside, how about we go out, you know? - Start over? - So I don't toss you out? Yeah. I'm Parker. I'm a paramedic. Not an ambulance chaser? No, I'm inside the ambulance, so what do ya say? You know... I really do appreciate the gifts. - But... - But? But, I'm kinda seein' somebody else right now. Adam? Yes, yes, the real one. Well, then, we'll go as friends. Come on! I mean, after a long day of baking, you need a break, so... how about... ice cream? Ice cream? Well I figure it's safe because you don't sell it. So, you're probably not tired of it, but you pick. Well, you know, I'm supposed to close up tonight. We have a huge batch that's due in the morning, and I... No, I got this. You go. She's got this. Okay... - ...alright. - Yes. Alright, call me if you need anything. - Thanks. - You're welcome. So, real Adam. What about him? Well, as your friend, I'm curious about 'em. What's he like? - He's tall. - Okay. - He has trendy hair. - Yes! He's nice. Some spark between you two. And what about you, huh? You been goin' out much? Not really. Why not? Work keeps me busy. Yeah, me too. My sister seems to think because she has to, you know, juggle a household with kids and husband and everything, that all of us must just have so much time. Why does she care so much? I think maybe because she's family. She feels responsible. Older sister? Yeah. My parents actually died when I was younger, so she likes to claim that she raised me. Well, it's nice to have someone who cares. Yeah. So, other than cooking, what do you like to do? - Bake more. - Oh come on. Yeah, I do. I have this competition coming up and that's what I've been workin' on. - A baking competition? - Yeah. It's a pretty big deal. Yeah, but you don't bake all day. So, what do you do? Do you like to read, build stuff, any hobbies? Read, sure, yeah. But, I'm tellin' ya, I really, I just don't have any time. Okay, okay, put it this way. If you had time, what would you do? Paint. What, like brushes and canvas? No, finger paint. Yes, brushes and canvas. Why don't you? I honestly, I just don't have time. You know, we find the time for things that are important. What about you? Do you eat, sleep, and breathe being a paramedic? No. No, I hear that leads to burnout. Alright, so then, what do you do for fun? Well, I... go out with women who are late to blind dates. - That's wrong. - Brain freeze. So, how long have you been a paramedic? - About a year. - A year? And what did you do before that? You know, a little of this and that. What made you wanna become a paramedic? You know, I wanted to be able to honk at people and run red lights legitimately. Well, thank you for the milk shake. My pleasure. - Hey Trish! - Oh hi, Adam, hi. I had a major break through in one of my cases. - Thought we should celebrate. - Congratulations. This is... this is Parker. Just a friend. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, yes it is. So... Yeah, you know, I'll see you later. Okay. He's not that tall. Nice to meet you Adam. What are you doin'? What? You're setting yourself up for heartbreak. Well, it's not like I want it that way. Weren't you tellin' me to go after her? Well, yeah, but not if you're the one gettin' hurt. And here I thought you'd say, "Put yourself out there. "Nothing risked, nothing gained." What is the big deal, right? If it doesn't work out, you move on. This girl I'm datin' right now, her cousin is smokin' hot. Thanks, but no. No, no, Milo's got the right idea, sort of. Maybe you should focus on dating someone who's available. You guys are makin' this harder than it needs to be. Just shoot the ball. Come on. Fine, make a shot. It's crazy out there. We're almost out of eclairs. A guy came in and bought a whole bunch for his office. - What? - What? This is supposed to have scallops on the side. It looks fine. - This is for sale. - Just one slice. You're literally eating my profits. Okay, I've got that meeting with the bank. - What for? - For the second store. You know, I can handle it here. You should just go. No, you know what, I think I'm just gonna reschedule. You know what, I'll get that. Thank you. - What? - What what? The oven's not working. It was working all morning. Those are definitely half baked. I know. What are we gonna do? There's already not very much on the display cases. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. - Do you want me to help? - Can you fix an oven? No. Hi, this is Trish from the Cupcake Palace. Yeah, hey, listen, my oven just stopped working. I was wondering if you could send somebody by to come and look at it. No, I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm a bakery and I need my oven. Okay, look, listen, if anyone cancels, can you just give me a call, please? Thank you. You need to call another company. Here's another one. Perfect, thank you. Hi, this is Trish from the... I'm on hold. Dave, I need the deposition transcripts from Tuesday. I'm on it. Trish, how are you? I'm okay. Listen, do you have a moment? Yeah, if it's quick. Okay, my oven just broke down and I've been on the phone looking for repairmen everywhere, and well, I can't find anybody, so do you know of anybody handy or do you think you might be able to look at it? Yeah, I could probably stop by later tonight. Oh wait... Trish, I gotta go. I'll call ya later, okay? Okay. Bye, bye. Any luck? No, we're gonna have to improvise. You know what, why don't you just take those on up to my apartment, 'cause the oven works there. They won't all fit. I know, but just do what you can. Hi... this is Trish. Hey, are you busy? So, that's fake Adam. So what happened? I don't know. It just stopped working right in the middle of a batch. Has it had problems lately? No, this is totally out of the blue. - Is it still under warranty? - 'Course not. - Where are your circuit breakers? - This way. Right, let's see. Alright, let's see if I reset it, if that will work. - Did that fix it? - I don't know. - It's still not heatin' up. - The fan's working. - It's a gas oven, right? - Yeah. Alright, lemme check the pilot light. Nope, not down here. Alright, it's plugged in. Main gas line is on. Here's the pilot. But it's off. - It could be the flame sensor. - What? Well, if it's dirty or there's a blockage, it prevents the flow of gas. Do you have something to clean it off with? How about this? Yeah, maybe something a little bit bigger. Like a rough sponge? It's a big sensor. Alright. It's like a cotton swab. This? Will that work? That should work. Let's see. Alright, turn it off. - Okay, it's off. - Okay. Let's see if this is gonna work. That should do it. Try that. Okay. It works! You fixed it. Yeah, I'd still get it checked out. Yeah... I'm impressed. Hey Katie, it's back on! - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you so much. - It was no trouble. I feel bad bugging you on your day off. Well, you can make it up to me. Let me take you out. There's something going on tomorrow I think you'd really like. Don't mind me. - Parker. - Come on. As a token of your gratitude. Okay. I thought this could be a chance to try your potential hobby. Well, I really don't know how to paint though. It's a class. We'll be in good company. Alright everyone, take your places. Does everyone have a canvas? - You're really good at this. - I'm not so sure. How about yours? How's yours coming? It's perfect, I know. It's the shading. That's the tricky part, right? - I feel like it's just so flat. - Well, it is your first painting. You'll be a pro in no time. I don't think I have time for more. You'll find it. How do you do it? How do you make time? When I have a day off, I use it. Really? When I'm not at work, I feel like that's all that I think about. Yeah, but don't you have great people who can handle things there? Yeah, I'm just always worried that if I'm gone for too long, there's gonna be some massive crisis and I'll be the only one that could fix it. You need a little bit of faith, don't you think? Don't you get scared? I mean, scared that maybe you could be the one that could save someone if you were on duty? I'm just as scared when I'm on duty. Really? I guess I feel like if I'm there, I'll have some kind of control. I'm never in control, but I do what I can. So, what do you do if you feel like that there's someone you can't help? Well, my training says to stay calm, try whatever I can and make a difference anyway. But... But what? Really, what I try to do is not think about it. Does that work? Not yet, but I keep tryin'. So, why do you keep trying if it bothers you so much? Which I understand that it could. Because of all the times me being there did change the outcome. So you said the other night that you haven't been a paramedic for long, right? - Yes. - What'd you do before that? - Before? - Yeah. You know, nothing... important. Well, you had to have switched careers, right? - Yeah, but... - What was it? Like an early midlife crisis or something? You could call it that. Yeah, I'm in the middle of mine right now. I really wanna open up a second Cupcake Palace. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, it's doing really well. I just... I wanna see it grow. Actually, the place that I'm thinking of opening is really close by. - Do you wanna go check it out? - Sure, yes. Okay. - Wait, this is a great spot. - Yeah, assuming I can afford it. I figure it's not too far away for me to be inconvenient. Yeah, but far enough way that it doesn't compete - with the first bakery. - Yeah, that's the hope. - I know it needs a lot of work. - What? Yeah, anything will, but I see the potential. You know, I could even see like some outdoor seating area around here. Yes! That's what I was thinking. A Cupcake Palace would fit right in here. Feels really good to hear somebody else say that. Naw, it's a great idea. I hope it works for you. Thanks. Sometimes I feel a little silly 'cause, you know, it's just cupcakes, it's not like I'm saving lives or anything. Yeah, but cupcakes they... they cheer people up. I hadn't thought about it like that before. I know it's made a difference to me. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Come on. I mean, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm amazed you've been talkin' to what's his name. I keep calling him "fake Adam". It's Parker. - Parker? - Yeah. I mean, are you starting to like him more than Adam? I'm not sure. I guess I could be. But Adam is amazing. He's a lawyer. He's wealthy, he's stable, and all that, and he's really good looking. Should Dillon be worried? Parker seems nice and he's handsome. Yeah, I mean, I'd say Parker. But, there's just... there's still so much I don't know about him. You could say the same about Adam. No, not really. Because he talks about himself a lot. Like, all the time. But with Parker, I just, I don't know, he seems really guarded. What, like he's secretive? No... there's just something. I don't know. Open up. Those look perfect. You girls don't have to be here. I can do this. You have to choose a cupcake for the competition. I know. Hey you should let that cool. No, you need to try one with the peanut butter creme frosting and the cookie. Oh yeah. I just don't know what to pick. So, what's your favorite so far? Well, I would say out of the fruity ones, - I like the strawberry lemon. - Definitely. But with the chocolatey... I don't know. It just depends on how these turn out. I like the cookie dough. - Nope, it's too sweet. - Too sweet. Maybe we need an outside opinion. Well, we can't ask Chloe 'cause she likes everything. What about Adam? You've been talking to Chloe, haven't you? I was thinking more along the lines of Parker. Well... Chocolate Peanut butter is his favorite flavor. So, Lindsay goes to get a drink and I see this woman. Red hair, gorgeous blue eyes, I mean, she's stunning. Okay. Please, not another one of these stories. Just hear me out, okay? So, there happens to be this guy standing next to me, so I just mumble somethin' to him about how beautiful she is. - So? - It was Lindsay's brother. But, why would he care if you said that? Well, I might have been a little more colorful in my description. Smooth. Hi. - Can we help you? - Hey! Hi. Guys, this is Trish. - Hey. - Hey, hi again. Tom, yeah, it's good to see ya. We were just gonna go check our gear somewhere else. No actually, I could really use your help. Really? I'm tryin' to come up with a great recipe for the baking competition at the end of the week. And so, I thought I could use a second opinion. - And a third and a fourth. - Sweet! - I can definitely help there. - Here. Yeah. - Well, I'm glad you came by. - Yeah, me too. Is that... is that peanut butter? Yeah, with chocolate. - That is amazing. - Really? Do you think it's good enough to win? - I'd vote for this. - Yeah. - I would vote yes. - But, for which one? - Any of 'em. - That's helpful, yeah. - I'll actually try the other one. - Take 'em all. I'll give you a tour. Alright, here, enjoy, and make sure you let me know okay? She's got nice cupcakes. This is where we keep our gear, close and convenient for when we go out on calls, train... You know, we do a lot of drills and what not. I've always wondered how you work, you know, keep steady in the back of one of these things. Well, you ever sit on one of those big Pilates balls? Yeah. It's kinda like that. We take turns making meals. Simple, nothing grand. Yeah, instant noodles. Pretty gourmet. Which is why a lot of times we just order take out. - This is our locker area. - Nice. It's functional. Your tax dollars at work. - Parker. - Yeah chief? I need a signature and some details on that call from Overton Street. - I... - Yeah, it's fine. I'll be right back. Sorry about that, my... Trish? Trish? Leave me alone. - Wait, Trish, wait! - Leave me alone. What's going on? You're gonna play innocent, really? Whatever it is you think I did, I'm pretty sure you're wrong. 'Cause I've caught you lying to me twice now. And what's sad is it's not just to me. What are you talking about? Your wife. I saw the picture. My wife? You know, I'm not the kind of person that does the whole cheating thing. So, once and for all just leave me alone. I give up. Why put yourself out there for someone who keeps jumping to conclusions? I knew you were hiding something. I felt it. You wanna assume the worst about me? That's fine. I'll leave you alone. - So, are you gonna be okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be fine. He did not seem the type. He seemed so nice. Yeah, I just, I was so gullible. - No, no you weren't. - No, no you weren't. It doesn't matter anyway. Competition is in a couple of days and I just... really need to focus on that. So, does this mean you're giving up on Adam? I'm just asking because he asked Dillon about you yesterday. I marked the changes... just send them over to Edward, alright? Got it. - Hey, Trish, come in! - Hi. Hey! - How are ya? - I'm good. Well, thanks for stoppin' by for lunch today. Oh yeah, sure. I just need to wrap some things up here, but there's this great place across the street, it's pretty good. Okay, that sounds good. Great. - I brought you my latest. - It looks delicious. - Do you mind if I? - Yeah, go ahead. Look at that. So, how you been? It's been awhile. Yeah, sorry about that. I've been good, I'm good. Lately I've just been a little stressed but... Yeah, I've got this big cupcake competition coming up at the end of the week. - You should come. - For sure, I'll be there. Great. How about you? How are things here? Oh good. Just swamped. I've got this client makin' my life difficult. He keeps goin' to my boss even though I'm the attorney on this case. I'm sorry. Well, I have an idea on how to calm him down, I just need more time to figure it out. Which is fine since I can bill 'em for it too. - So, it's still a win. - There you go. Excuse me Adam, Edward wants to see you. Did you send him the changes? Yes, but I don't think he's in love with 'em. Yeah. So sorry. - Let's reschedule, okay? - Okay. Thanks for the brownie. It's a cupcake. - Alright, how's that coming? - We are ready. Okay, these just need to go into the car. - Hon, will you grab the cashbox? - Got it. We could use some change though, coins and ones. Okay, I thought I had those in there. Okay, alright, so these are for the judges. And these are to sell. Alright, I'll drive. You have been working non-stop. Don't you want me to drive? - No, I'm fine. - Come on! Listen, if I drive I won't be nervous about being late to the fair, okay? No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're done. Do we have more in the other boxes? No, those are the regular flavors to sell. - Maybe we could use one of them. - Not for the competition. They have to be new and special. Maybe we could salvage. No, okay, we just have to... we have to make more. - What's the recipe? - We don't have enough time. Piper. - Where's the cocoa? - There. How much peanut butter in the frosting? I would do just maybe two or... - What are you guys doing? - What we do best. No, I told you, we don't have enough time. There is if you'll let us help. I can drive to the competition now and start setting up. And maybe the judge won't come to our booth first. Okay? We can drive over as soon as we're done here. You know, we can do this. Half cup. Peanut butter in the frosting. I'll see you there. Piper, can you make sure that you call Chloe? She should be on her way over to help, and make sure you reserve a spot where we can stage these for the judges. - Got it. - Great. Wait, no, no, no, no, not as much water. Okay. Right. And make sure you add a little bit of evaporated milk. Got it. - And did you make sure... - Trish, you make the frosting. Okay. Welcome to this year's Cup of Cakes competition! We're grateful for our sponsor, Fine Baking, who is making this possible with a grand prize of $30,000 to the winner! Yes! Our judges are just getting ready to start their rounds now. So, we'll leave it to their taste buds to find the best cupcake! Okay, okay, okay, here they come. Oh thank goodness. - Hey, where are they? - The judges are coming right now. - Around in a circle, there ya go. - There, all done. Great. Take that, take that. Hello. Hi, welcome to the Cupcake Palace. Tell us about it. This is a chocolate based cupcake with a hint of hazelnut, freshly ground peanuts. It's got the filling of white chocolate mousse, and it's topped with amlight peanut butter frosting and a miniature peanut butter, cookie. - And the drizzle? - The drizzle is a dark chocolate. - Okay? - Okay, thanks. Thank you. Bye-bye. - What do you think? - I don't know. It's over now. It's not a bake off. I hate these things, just sittin' around all day, nothin' to do. How is that any different from what we do normally? At least at the fire station, I have some distractions, you know? What like losing at hoops all day? Hey, one game is not all day, sir. Hey! Not so bad now, is it? - No, can we do CPR... - No. Thank you. - What is taking so long? - I don't know. - Why don't they give us the results? - Just be patient. - I'll be back. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Remember me? - Yeah, Tom, right? - Yeah, yeah. Wait, what are you doing here? On duty in case of any emergencies. I guess that makes sense. Listen, do you have a minute we could talk? Well, actually, I'm really busy right now... It's about Parker. Please? Just hear me out. Parker wasn't always a paramedic. He was a life science teacher or something at a high school. About three years ago, his wife, Elaine, had a heart attack, and Parker found her at the house. He'd come straight home after work and... he tried to save her, but he... She passed away. He was kind of a zombie for awhile there. Then he pulled himself together and he decided he didn't wanna let that happen to anyone else if he could help it. And that's when he became a paramedic. He went through all the training... just dove right in. I... I had no idea. He hasn't really been very open to relationships for a long time. But he said you ordered something strange the day you met. The very same thing his wife used to order when they ate there. And it... it caught him off guard. Or maybe it woke him up. Anyway, I just thought... I thought you should know the truth. I probably should get back, keep Milo out of trouble. Take care. Thank you. If we can get everyone to gather in, we're ready to announce the winners of the competition. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, we have the results of the Cup of Cakes competition. Let me just say that wow! Every baker here brought their A game. I've been looking forward to this, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Enough with the speeches already. Unfortunately, we can't make everyone a winner. So, the third place winner is... Lena Albertson. Lena used her grandmother's prized apple strudel recipe as inspiration for her cupcake. Thank you, Lena. That's nice, right? And our second place winner is... The Hey Batter Batter Bakery. Yeah! Didn't they win last year? The Hey Batter Batter Bakery used a key lime cupcake topped with a raspberry-lime frosting, and a sugar lime wedge on the top. Congratulations. Alright, now, for the grand prize winner, who will not only get the winning recipe printed on the back of Fine Baking products, but will also go home with $30,000. The Cupcake Palace! The Cupcake Palace created a chocolate cupcake with a filling of white chocolate mousse. On top, it's garnished with a perfect peanut butter frosting, and a miniature cookie. Congratulations! So, when you get your second bakery, do I get to be manager? Easy Piper. We'll see. Girls, so I really couldn't have done this without you today, thank you so much. Well, you just try to remember that. Yeah, especially around bonus time. It's out of control. Is that ready? Yeah, you can take that, thank you. Good. Hi. What are you doin' here? I ran into Tom at the competition, and he told me about your wife. So? So, I wanted to apologize. That's why I'm here. Don't trouble yourself. I should never have jumped to conclusions. I feel horrible about how I treated you and... I'm sorry. You done? Yeah. Parker, are you even gonna say something, anything? I didn't tell you about Elaine 'cause I didn't want your sympathy. What's wrong with sympathy if it helps me understand better? If you would have told me about her and your situation... My situation? Have you even considered that maybe I wanted you to see me for me? Not some widower to be pitied. Besides, I'm not someone who'd use her memory as a pick up line to get some woman's attention. - I never would have thought that. - You sure? Parker you never told me anything about your past. What was I supposed to think? I was beginning to worry that, I don't know, maybe you were hiding something. Trish, Trish, I am tired of trying to prove myself to you. You're always tryin' to find some way for us not to be together. - No, I'm not. - Honey, it's not worth it anymore. - Parker I... - Look, what did you say? Something about how we weren't supposed to meet anyway. I mean, the only reason we did was because of a time change. So, please just go on with your life and I'll go on with mine. When's the next order of creme coming in? Trish? Cream? - Are we getting more in soon? - Yeah, tomorrow. - Can you take that? - Yeah. Thanks. Excuse me, is this the place I can find an award winning cupcake? I told my boss about it, but of course, he doesn't want to hear any bad news. Even though I clearly had a solution of my own. Sort of. So I spend the rest of the day digging through all the ideas I could find on how to calm him down so that he'd be in a listening mood. - And did it work? - Not fast enough. He over reacts and chews out the other side, which will cost us. But hey, not my fault. I think it'll be good though because he'll still see that I was right. Might even help with the whole partner thing, too. Yeah that's great. Of course, then I find out that Jimmy, who's been at the firm three years longer than me, has been lobbying for partner too. Not sure what I'll do about that. I mean, he's a nice guy, but no killer instinct. Hey... you okay? Adam? Yeah? - I don't think this makes sense. - What? Well, grand prize winner, how's it feel? Wonderful. You gonna go ahead and open up a new store then? Yeah, I actually signed the paperwork yesterday. Good. - I'm glad this is working out for you. - Yeah me too. Too bad it didn't work out with Adam. It really was amicable. Really, he was really understanding. Of course he was. Because he's a great guy. Listen Chloe, I know that you liked him, but that, it just wasn't enough. - I thought you liked him too. - I did and I do... just not as much as he likes himself. Do you know what he said when I told him that we could - no longer see each other? - What? He said that it was okay because he needed somebody that was more focused on him. Oh my gosh! Are you gonna be okay? Yes. I'm gonna be fine. I will, I'm gonna be fine. I have so much to keep me busy with the second store opening, and if all goes well, hopefully we'll be open by the end of the year. - Lookin' good. - Thank you. Alright, remember to behave and don't touch anything unless the firemen say it's okay, alright? Hello kids. - Hi. - Hello. Who wants to learn all about what we do here? Fight fires! Yes we do. Now, we share the fire station with a paramedic crew. Who can tell me what a paramedic is? - They drive ambulances. - Yes they do. And over there are our paramedics. Not only do they drive ambulances, but more importantly, they help people who are sick or injured. Why don't you follow me over here, I'll show you some fire engines. Oh, Brooke, no! No, no honey, don't drink that! It's yucky! - Why do kids do that? - Kids will be kids, I guess. I know, but I don't want her to get sick. Yeah. I went with Brooklyn's preschool on their field trip to the fire station. Oh yeah? Yeah, I saw Parker. Don't worry, I didn't say anything. I don't think he even recognized me, so. - How did he look? - The same. You know that I just want you to be happy? Ever since mom and dad died, I tried my best to help give you a good big sister. You were, you are. It's just, I know I can be overbearing and with the whole date set up thing, well, they haven't all been great. But the thing is, you just had to find something wrong with every single one no matter what. And that really frustrated me. That's 'cause it's not your responsibility. I know, but it doesn't mean I don't care. I'm not saying they're perfect. But you and Parker clicked, and that didn't happen with anyone else. So? So what do you think you would have thought of Adam if there were no Parker? I think maybe you were punishing Parker, and that's why you accepted Adam so easily. Okay, why are you tellin' me all this? Are you just tellin' me this to make me feel worse? No. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that Parker is probably hurt too. And no matter what he did, what you said, maybe he needs a chance to fall in love with you again. And that wraps up our evening set. It's 10:30. Remember to set back your clocks tonight with the end of Daylight Savings. Hey, I can do that. Oh no, it's good, I'm fine. You go ahead and take off. - You sure you don't need any help? - Yeah, you can close on Monday. Alright. I almost forgot. Chloe was in here earlier and wanted me to remind you about breakfast tomorrow morning at nine. Right, right, thanks for that. I'll text her. - Okay, have a good night. - You too. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Rice. I gotta get rice. I gotta get rice. - Hi. - Hi. How many in your party? Two, actually, but I think she must be running late. Do you wanna be seated or would you like to wait for her? Yeah, I think, can I just wait? Okay, thanks. - Hi. - Hi. I'm here to pick up a to go order. - Okay, what's the name? - Parker. Parker, okay. - Hi. - Hi. - You waiting for someone? - Chloe actually. She's supposed to meet me here for breakfast at nine. Of course, she's running late. Did you forget what day it is? - It's Sunday. - Naw, that's not what I meant. It's actually eight o'clock right now. - What? - Time change. My guess is that you're an hour early. No, no no no, no. - Did you fry your cell phone again? - Drowned it actually, yeah. Okay, what about your alarm clock? Well you know, it works, but only if you... - ...set it right. - Set it right. Yeah, maybe you shouldn't make any plans near Daylight Savings. Maybe. But, then I never would have met you. - Here's your food. - Alright, thank you. - Enjoy. - Thanks. It was... see ya around. You too. Parker. Yeah? - Hey. - Hey. - How have you been? - Good, you? Yeah, me too. Chloe saw you the other day at her daughter's field trip. Oh good. - How is she? - Fine, yeah, thanks. - Is the oven still workin'? - Yes. Yeah, I haven't had any problems with it since you fixed it. I saw something about the new bakery, it's opening soon, isn't it? Yeah, this week. You should come. I'm glad things are going well for you. I made the chocolate peanut butter cup cake regular on the menu. Oh yeah? Yeah, so if you're in the neighborhood, it's on the house. Well... it was really good seeing you. You too. Take care. - Good, I'm starving. - What'd you get? The usual. So, I got a thing. My cousin's wedding I gotta go to it. So, could one of you cover my shift on Friday? I've got plans. This Friday? You didn't block it off? - No. - Do you have a date? Of course, I have a date. Who are you talkin' to here? So you have a date before you have someone to cover your shift. Smart. Look don't hate on me, okay? It's my cousin's wedding. Alright? But the date. Fine, so you're out. How about you? You gonna hook a brother up? - Parker? - What? Are you here man? I'm sorry, sorry. You okay? What's up? Just I saw Trish. - When? - Just now at the restaurant. So, how was it? It was awkward. It means you're still not over her. What? Why? Just does, right? I haven't talked to her in months. But you're still thinkin' about her. Maybe. You should do somethin' about it. Oh come on, guys. You know the history. It's not gonna happen. Yeah, but, you're still thinkin' about her and things are still awkward, means you probably wish you could go back and change things. So, where are we on my shift? Alright? Thanks for comin' in. We have half a tray of chocolate croissants left. - That's all that's left? - We totally sold out. This came for you. "I'd like to give us another chance, "can you give me the time of day?" Looks like the store's a hit. Yeah, we've had a really good day. It's a self updating alarm clock. It automatically adjusts to Daylight Savings time. Both in the spring and the fall. So, even if you break your phone, you'll always have the correct time. Well, I definitely could use this, so, thank you. Look, I'm really, really sorry about what happened before. I know. Me too. I was hiding things. I didn't want to think about my past, so I tried to bury it and that made things worse. But I can definitely understand why. Thanks. You know, I'm starting to believe in destiny. - Oh really? - Lately, yeah. I mean, who knew somethin' as simple as a time change could lead me to you? Do you mean that? Yeah. Besides, I think we've wasted enough time, don't you think? Yeah. Hey, can you help me set this up? Or whatever? - It's a clock. - Yeah, I know. You plug it in. - Well, you know me. - Are you serious? And technology. It's not a good track record. - And if I'm late because of you... - Okay, okay, okay. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
