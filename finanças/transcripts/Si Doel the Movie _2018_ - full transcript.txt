Doel, even if I always yell at you... ...but I'd do anything... ...for you. Hey, primitive boy, are you proud to be the subject of a thesis? Don't ever call me your father again. You won't get any cents from my inheritance. Please don't be too harsh on him. Just look at Hilman, he's a college graduate... ...still he'd end up opening a clothes stall in Tanah Abang. Doel, if anything happen to me, please take care of Zaenab. I'm worried about her. Her whole life is spent taking care of her parents. I'm sending you to college to get good education. Not to become an oplet driver. I want you to be a governor someday! - Your cart is still full. - I haven't sell much today. Going on a aeroplane, toot toot, toot! And Atun is staying home. To Holland, to Amsterdam. Freedom! Freedom to Indonesia! Have I had breakfast? I'll just have one at the airport. Say goodbye first. Mpok. Mpok. - What is it, Mandra? - Are you sleeping? - No. - I thought you were. What do you want? I want to say goodbye. I don't want to be late to the airport. You know how the traffic is nowadays. - Is it time? - It is. Where's Doel? He's getting ready in his room. Take this jacket with you. I don't want you to get cold. Okay. Behave yourself, don't embarrass Doel. I won't. I'm not a kid anymore. What do you want me to get you from there? Do you have money to buy me some souvenirs? Don't worry, Hans might give me some dollars. I just told you not to embarrass Doel. And now you're telling me that you expect money from Hans? We should be thankful for him helping Doel find a job. And for flying you there too. You don't need to get me anything. Your only job there is to take care of Doel. Don't worry about that I can handle it. Stay heathy at home. Don't get sick. InsyaAllah, I'll try to stay healthy. Say hello to Hans for me. Tell him thank you. I will. - I should go now. - Okay. Doel, are you done packing? I'm carry the stuff out. I'm done here. You can carry them out. And wait for the taxi outside, It'll be here any minute. Whoa, this is heavy! What did you fill this box with? Why do you have to bring everything? I can't imagine carrying this when we get there. Thank God Hans didn't order a becak. I don't know how we'd going to pack it and carrying it there. I'll just drag this suitcase. I'm soaking with sweat and I'm still at home. - You're not forgetting anything? - I don't think so. Say goodbye to Nyak. I'll help you pack this. Did you book taxi from online service? I booked it from online service. Nyak, I'm leaving. Okay, Doel. Take good care of yourself. How long are you going to be there? Are you going to be there long? No, Nyak. I'd be there only for a week. Wish me luck. I wish everything goes as you planned. Could you help me carry these stuff? I have someone that I need to say goodbye first. Denok, it's not that I don't love you. But I'm going on a vacation to Holland. Behave yourself. Bye! Hurry up, Mister. And also turn your car around. Doel, promise me... Don't look for Sarah there. You'd better not seeing her. It didn't mean I don't like her, but you have Zaenab here. She loves you, she takes care of you and everything else. I can't imagine my life without Zaenab. If you're gone, who would take care of me? I'm bed ridden. I need someone to feed me and give me drink. - I shoud go now. - Okay. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumussalam warrahmatullahi wabarakatuh. - Did you say goodbye to her? - I did. Are you leaving right now? I am. Take care of Nyak while I'm gone. No problem, don't forget the souvenirs. Silly. - My suitcase, please? - I'll do that. Don't forget to buy me chocolate and cheese. - Okay. - And their traditional clogs. - What for? - It's their traditional wooden shoes. - You don't need that. - They're good to display. If guests ask, I couId tell them they're from you... ...when you went to Holland. I can brag about it. Then I won't buy them. Abi's not home yet? You're asking if he's home? He's never home this early. - He's been gone all day. - Say goodbye for me. - Okay. - Where's Bang Mandra? Hurry up or you're gonna be late to the airport! I'm in the car! I've been waiting for you! - It's hot outside. - Watch it! I hope you'd shrink like raisin in their cold weather! Hurry up, let's go to Holland. I can't stand the humidity. I don't like living in Indonesia. - What a snot. - I'd better go. - Okay. - Atun. Say hello to Sarah for me. - !!! - !!! ??? The suitcase, please. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumussalam. Bye, Atun, Zaenab. Too bad you won't go with us. I forgot to tell you, my room key is on the sewing machine. Don't forget to mop my room. Bye, Atun. You're not coming with us! I'm going to the store and I have to iron the clothes. Okay. I'll help you carry the dry clothes inside. Okay. Bang, don't embarrass me on the plane, okay? No worries. I've learned everything before we go. How to buckle the seatbelt, and table manner. I know all about those things. I won't embarrass you. You'd forget If I don't keep reminding you. I'm not a child. Selfie time. Both of us. - Take my picture. - What for? I want to send it to Atun. To make her more jealous. Because she's not coming with us. Nyak, we're living in the millennium. Why do make me use coal iron for ironing? My face is full of soot. - Darn! - What's wrong, Tun? Bang Mandra already sent me his photos on the way to the airport. I should've gone with them, the merrier the better. It will cost Hans more to fly you too. He won't mind. He's rich. He bought dad's land when he was in college... ...to pay Bang Doel's college. - He did? - Yeah! Without his help, Bang Doel wouldn't be an engineer like he is today. He would be kicked out from school. Now I believe that his only intention was to help Bang Doel. He rarely contact us. And when he did, he ordered traditional Betawi stuff. He said it's for Tong Tong Fair there. He said he needs Kebaya, Encim top, dodol, rebana and stuff. He could ask Bang Doel to send them instead of delivering them in person. He even tell him to take Bang Mandra too. Lenong can't be performed by two persons only. I've searched the internet. And they said Tong Tong Fair is still two months from now. Why did he ask him to come today? Maybe there are preparations needed for the festival. There are only two options in my head. Either he sincerely wants to help Bang Doel. Or somebody else asked his help to invite Bang Doel. - I don't understand. - Does Sarah still live in Holland? What does it have to do with her? You don't know that Sarah is Hans's cousin? I smell something fishy. Sit down. - Miss - Yes, Sir? How to strap this thing? Coud you help me? Hold on, pull this part of the belt. And strap it like this. - And this is how you unbuckle it. - All right. Now, excuse me. Miss, it's open again! Look! - Let me help you with that. - I'm so sorry. - There you go. - I'm not bothering you, right? Hey, I'm gonna get a doctor to tranquillize you. I think I saw one there. Sit down and be good. You're just jealous. Are the people on this plane don't feel cold? I'm so cold. Doel. Can they turn down the AC? It's so cold, I'm freezing. Tell them to turn down the AC, Doel. Say something. Are you deaf? It's so cold. Where are we, Doel? We'll be popsicles in here. My body is so stiff. Is Bunda still up? It's late. I hope she doesn't know I'm still not home. Where did Kong Mandra keep the key? - Oy! - Bunda. - Assalamu'alaikum, Bunda. - Wa'alaikumussalam. What are you doing with your uncle's window? - Do you want to break his window? - I'm looking for the key. But you acted like a thief. Where have you been? I went out with Salam to the internet cafe. How many times have I told you, don't spend all of your time there. That's a bad habit. He has a new game. And I had to come or I won't get the prize. Don't talk back to me. - And where's your bag? - Kong Mandra borrowed it. It's becoming a habit for him. Here's the key. Take shower and pray before bed. Does Sarah still live in Holland? You don't know Hans is Sarah's cousin? Where's Hans? He said he'd pick us up. Let's wait there. Why did we have to leave the warmth inside and go here? He told us to wait him here. He won't find us if we stay inside. - He won't be long. - I can't stand the cold. Just hold on, I'm cold too. What are you doing? Thank God I brought this from home. I don't want to get sick, you know. You're embarrassing me. I'm not embarrasing you. I'm freezing. But you're wearing sarong, and ... We're not going to a ceremony! Shut up. I'm freezing. You're embarrasing me. Doel! Hello! Sorry, I'm late. - Bang, look who's here. - How are you, Bang? I'm great! Long time no see. - Sorry I'm late. - What took you so long? I'm so cold. I'm shrinking like a raisin. It's wasn't that long. Your plane just landed, right? It did. You look slimmer. I am. Depressed maybe? But look at you, you look bigger! On the nose! Darn you. It reminds me of your dad when I was in your house a lot. "The big nose is here!" - You've got everything here? - Yeah. Let's go, then. - Where are we going? - Just follow him. In Europe, gas is expensive and parking lot are hard to find. Let's take the train. Train? What if we want to go sightseeing? If it's far, I can rent a car. But if it's near, we can ride bicycles. Is it safe to ride a bike around here? Peope in Holland ride bicycles everywhere. You'll see once we get off the train. To the left. Hans. Can you take my picture in front of the door? Okay. So it's true, people here love to ride bikes. Look. That woman is riding a bike too. You can see bicycles parked everywhere. If we buy these bike, we can sell them at home. - Can we, Hans? - Of course. You can even buy a boat if you have the money. How do we hand carry it? That's insane. Okay, this is my house. Haus (thirsty)? I am not thirsty yet! - My home! - Oh, your home? Cool house. How do you call this building? - Rumah Susun or Rumah Lapis? - We called it apartment, Bang. It's rented, isn't it? - Come in, Doel, Bang. - I can't believe we're in Holland. Get inside. Watch your step. The stairs are steep, I don't want you to trip. What floor your apartment is on? We're almost there. It's on the second floor. You need help? I'm good. But if it's on fourth floor, I'm gonna get a hernia. - Do you own this place? - Of course not. I rent it. I can't afford my own apartment, it's too expensive. - It's rented and it's a pain to us - Hurry up. This is my firsttime to Holland, but you treat me like a porter. - Why are you yelling at me? - Just let's go. Talk is cheap, you know. But this is heavy! You could've carry it in your hands. I think my neck is broken. I don't know if I can turn it around again. - Come in. - I'll blame you for that. - Oh my God. - Careful where you put it. Your apartment is so tiny. It's tiny, yet has the most gorgeous view. Look at those boats sail around. This is Holland city, right? No, it's city of Amsterdam. Now, are you ready to have breakfast or do you want to take shower first? I vote shower. I haven't take any since yesterday. Doel wouldn't even allow me to wash my face. He said, don't play with water on the plane. - I could cause a short circuit. - That's priceless, Doel. This is your room. I hope it's not too small for both of you. If you want, you can sleep on the couch. No problem. I can sleep here or on the floor. I used to sleep in my oplet all the time. - By the way, do you have hot shower? - Of course. Then, excuse me. I'm gonna use the bathroom first. - Where should we put these stuff? - I'll take care of them. - Here's the keys. - For the suitcases? - Yeah. - Okay. They're here. Okay. Have Bang Doel called you? Not yet. - Why? - They should've arrived now, right? - Maybe they're still busy. - Could be. - Do you need my help here? - No, I'm fine. - I'm gonna bathe Nyak then. - Okay. Hans, is the restaurant far from here? No, it's just around the block. Take the bike over there. - We're riding bikes? - Yeah. Are these yours? Yeah. I take this bike, and you ride that "tandom" bike. It's "tandem" bike. Do you still remember how to ride it? Don't underestimate us. Of course we can ride a bike. We still have the bike from Doel's grandpa. Lets go, then. But I don't know how to ride this kind of bike, though. You sit on the front, then. I don't want to get us lost. Hop on. Great, he's gone. Your backpack is blocking me. Hold it for me then. Great, now I'm wearing your backpack too. Don't forget to paddle too. I can't paddle for both of us. I'm not ready! I hope you don't mind we're eating small breakfast. We'll have a big meal at dinner. This is called "Uitsmijter". It's their traditional breakfast menu. I can't pronounce that. At home, we call it fried eggs. What are these pink thing? Meat? I'm suspicious. Is this food halal? Of course. I won't give you haram food. - What's that? - It's salt, and that's pepper. By the way, have you ever cook in your apartment? No. I've never had time to cook. Just say that you can't cook. I have to apologize in advance for what I'm about to ask you. Your apartment looks like a bachelor's apartment. Have you been married? Do you have girfriend? Or are you stil single, or are you gay? That's an inappropriate question. Quit it. I apologized in advance to him. Don't yell at me. I didn't mean to offend him. Do you know why I asked it? His apartment smels single. No trace of women's scents. I can only trace roaches scents. I did apologize first, right? I've been married... and when we got divorced, she went back to her hometown. I live alone now. Don't worry, I'm straght. I thought you've never been married and you don't like women. How about you? Are you married? - Not really. - Seriously? I swear on your grave. Hey, I'm not dead yet! Watch it. Well, I beat you to it. We're different, me and Doel. I'm a divorcee without kids, but Doel has a child. Gosh, Nab, you have to eat. He's just been away for one night. He's gonna be there for a week, right? He said so. It's just... What? Nothing. Does Sarah really live in Holland? Don't ask me. I asked you first, remember? Why did you ask me? You didn't ask your man before he left? No. I just knew about it after you asked me. You can't believe what I said. But I think she's not there anymore. She left Bang Doel 14 years ago. I think she already married a white guy. - He texts me. - Congrats. Assalamu'alaikum, Nab.. I've arrived in Amsterdam since 08.00. I left the airport with Mandra. How are you and Nyak doing? He said he has arrived in Amsterdam. We're fine here. How are you and Bang Mandra doing there? It's afternoon here. What time is it there? We're fine too. It's 10 am now. It's morning there. It's windy and cold here, Nab. He sad it's cold there. Tell him to wear his jacket or he'll get sick. - Wish me luck. Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumussalam. Now eat. Please don't look for Sarah when you get there. Don't see her again. She already made your life miserable. It has been years since she left you. And you already have Zaenab as your wife now. Don't hurt her feelings. She loves you. Doel. Doel. What are you doing here? Are you daydreaming? Enjoying this peaceful and beautiful city. Peaceful and beautiful for foreigners. But for its residents, we have to struggIe everyday. Or you'll get depressed. You're going to regret it. Thanks for finding me a job. That's nothing. You already have a job in Jakarta. Take this trip as your vacation. I don't have a settle job. I'm only a freelance technician. Do you know why I'm sitting here alone? I have to convince myself that me being here is real. Oh, Doel. Hans, I'm going to be straight to you. Do you have other intention for inviting me here... ... besides asking me to deliver souvenirs for the Tong Tong Fair? There are no other intentions. I just want you to deliver them from Jakarta. But isn't Tong Tong Fair still one month away? Yeah, you're right. Actually it's still two months away. But I have to prepare many things. If I sold out the goods before the fair... I'm gonna have to ask you to buy them again from Jakarta. You really don't want me to fly you here again? I'd be happy if you do. Let's go home. I don't want Bang Mandra to worry. Hans, there's something I need to ask you. And you have to tell me the truth. What now? What do you mean when you said that we both are different? You don't have children, and I have one. Come on Doel. Don't be so serious. I was only joking with Mandra. Hans, when Sarah left me, she was pregnant. Just let it go, Doel. I'm gonna take you to Volendam. Hans. Is Sarah still lives here? In Amsterdam? - Do you still want to know the truth? - Yeah. I have a question for you too, and I want you to tell me the truth. About what? Do you still love Sarah? Well, do you? We're not divorced. And that woman in Jakarta, that's not your wife, Doel. If you still consider Sarah as your wife... why didn't you look for her when she left Indonesia? Where should I start? I asked her mother and she said Sarah had left to Holland. If you really know me, you'd know that I'm poor. And even if I went after her to this country... where should I start looking? Doel, Sarah doesn't live here anymore. I need salt from your stall. We ran out. Help yourself. Sorry I can't help you in the kitchen. I'm still washing the oplet. - That's okay, I don't mind. - Any news from Bang Doel? Not yet. Maybe he thinks it's expensive to call everyday. Hey, Koh Ahong! - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumussalam. - How are you? - Fine, thank you. It's been a while. My work kept me from going anywhere. How are you, Zaenab? Fine, thank you. Where did you come from? I come here from office. What a beauty, your oplet. Of course. Bang Doel fixed it, did a paint job, put new engine on it. - We're thinking of selling this thing. - But it's been yours for decades. I know. But nobody rides oplet anymore. And we don't have license for public transportation. You're right. How much do you sell it? He said he'd sell it for 60 million. Why don't you buy it? This is an antique car. 60 million? I have to think about it first. How is Nyak doing, Nab? Still the same. - Poor Nyak. - Take him to see Nyak. I still have to finish washing this oplet. Come inside. Nyak, there's somebody here to see you. - Who is it? - Koh Ahong. Hey, Ahong, it's been a while. How are you? - I'm fine, thanks. How are you? - Alhamdulillah. Sorry if I didn't come here sooner. That's okay. I know you're a busyman. How's your brick business going? I hope it's getting bigger. Alhamdulillah, thanks to your prayers, my factory is expanding. Thank God. I bring some snacks for Nyak. Koh Ahong is bringing us some snacks. Thank you, but you shouldn't have. It's nothing, really. How many children do you have now? !!! You're married, right? Not yet. Poor kid. You're old enough to be married. What are you waiting for? Nothing actually. I'll pray for you to get the right woman soon. Thank you, Nyak. I always pray for your health too. - Amen. - Thank you. Do you want to drink something? No, thank you. I have an appointment after this. Are you going to leave? But you're just arrived. I'll come visit you again. But I really have an appointment with someone. All right. Thanks for visiting us, Hong. - I'll see you later, Nyak. - Thank you for the gift. - You're welcome. Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumussalam. One more. One, two... Hans, get in the picture with us. That's okay. I have a lot of pictures like this. - One more. One more. One more - Okay. - What did he say? - One, two ... Okay. Okay. Go change your clothes. Okay. And I'll take you to a place where we can eat good salted fish. - When can we get the photos? - In 10 minutes. Okay, thanks. Great pictures. I like this one. The view, not you, Bang. You're annoying. Whatever. Doel, how about we go to the red light district tomorrow? Wait a minute, what is red light district? It's a place where only married people may go. I know I'm not married, but my face fits the requirement. - Don't underestimate me! - Whatever. I have an appointment with someone at Tropen Museum. Why don't you come with me? Not another museum. I'm tired of looking at old stuff. Are you sure he's going to take us to a museum? - Why did you ask? - You're primitive. I'm gonna put this photos in somewhere safe. You didn't eat? No, I don't eat dinner. Why do you need to diet? You'll be nothing but skin and bone. Doel might not like it. There won't be any left to hold. You're not serious, right? Any more news from Bang Doel? Not yet. He didn't send you photos from their trips? - No, he didn't. - Really? He sent me photos. - Really? - Check this out. I can't believe he didn't send you any. No, he didn't. Maybe he thinks if he sent you the photos,... he doesn't need to send them to me too. It's typically Bang Doel. Always protecting his reputation. Even by sending his photos to you. I hate Bang Mandra's photos so much. What a jerk. Please send them to me. I have to check Nyak. Okay, after I finished night prayer. This is Tropen Museum. One of the biggest museum in Holland. In this museum you can find artifacts and documents about Indonesia. They exhibit them separately in Indonesian Wing. You can walk around inside the museum... while me and Bang Mandra carry the souvenirs across the street. Don't you need my help? No, we can handle them. We won't be long. Just go to the museum. You'll love it there. Right, I don't need to go to the museum. It's not fun at all. - This is a primitive place. - Don't be long. - We won't. - Okay. !!! How are you, Doel? Fine. Do you remember when you drove me to Museum Gajah in Jakarta? You helped me with my research for my thesis. I do remember. This museum inspired me to write about the subject in my thesis. I used to come here a lot. I was so proud and happy because... ... there's a foreign country that values our culture so much. I was inspired to do a research about the people in Papua. But, after I met you... I was more interested in writing about you, Doel. Not that I thought you were primitive, like Bang Mandra said. But because you're one in a million. And I know many Betawi people. I wish I could take you to a museum in Leiden. They have many artifacts and history of Batavia, Betawi. How do you like Amsterdam? Do you enjoy it here? - I do. - I'm glad if you do. I'm just concerned about you staying in Hans's place. Because I know bedrooms in his place are small. Let's go get some drink. I miss your mom so much. How is she? She's been blind for almost 5 years now. - Blind? - Yeah. She went blind from glaucoma. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. But how is she now? Is she okay? She's bedridden, couldn't walk... ... after she fell in bathroom. Oh, my God. Hans has never told me about this. - You did nothing wrong. - No, it's my fault. If I didn't leave you, all of this might never happened. I could've take care of her. How is Atun and Mas Karyo? They're good? She's fine. Mas Karyo passed away five years ago. Thank you for coming here. I wish I could stay here forever and forget about my past. But I have to give in. Our son is growing up. He's almost 15 years old now. That's why I asked Hans... ... to contact you in hope to introduce you to him. His name is... ... Abdullah. But I always call him Doel. Do you know, in Dutch "doel" means "purpose". I want him to become a man with a purpose in his life. For the past 2 years... he's been asking to meet his father. In every school break,... he always asked me to take him home to Indonesia. But, my schedule was always tight. Sarah, this is Bang Mandra. Bang Mandra. Miss Sarah? - How are you? - I'm fine. It's been so long! Are you really Sarah? - I am. Why? Do you forget me? - Not really... - Don't say I'm fat or I'll get angry. - No. You're not fat. You're sexy. I'm just surprised to see you here. I'm confused. You look different. - Really? - Not really. - But you are Sarah, right? - Of course it's me. Do you really forget my face? Have you had breakfast? I don't want breakfast. He fed us bread everyday. He thinks we're birds. Sometimes want to eat rice. Hans, is that true? He ate fred rice yesterday. I don't want to eat fried rice. I want steamed rice with salted fish, sayur asam, and sambal. - Those kind of food. - You want that kind of food? - All right, I'll cook them for you. - No, no, no. - It's okay. - It's not okay. - Then let's have lunch at my house. - I don't want to trouble you. Now, I'm gonna have to go buy some groceries. - All right. - I'll see you at home. Doel, I'll see you at my house. - Later, Bang. - Bye! Doel, is that really Sarah? Hans, that's Sarah, right? Yeah, why? She's getting bigger? She's huge! Maybe that's one of the reason she didn't want to go back to Jakarta. What do you mean? Since she gave birth to Doel's son, she couldn't get her slim body back. She gave birth? Doel, you have a child with her? You didn't know when she left Doel, she was pregnant with his child? I swear didn't know that. I'm so disappointed in you! If you knew she was pregnant, why didn't you go after her? Please, you're making my headache worse. It's just a headache. But have you thought about her struggle... ... after she gave birth to your son? - You should've tried to find her. - Find her where? How should I know? I can't answer that question either. This is complicated. And what if Zaenab finds out... ... that you have a child with Sarah? And that she lives here. Zaenab knew Sarah left me when she was pregnant. Oh My God! I'm confused. This is complicated. This will create a lot of problems. A huge one! I don't want to be involved. I'd better leave now. Where are you going? Aren't you afraid of getting lost? I don't care if I get lost. The worst that could happen would be I wandered to Nigeria. I don't care. Nyak, do you want to eat your breakfast now? Maybe later. I'm not hungry. You're not going to the market? Atun is, and I'm taking care of other things at home. - You still sell cookies, right? - Yes, and the demands are increasing. I'm glad. I'll be okay. If you still have other things to do. I'll call you if I need anything. - All right. Call me if you need me. - Okay. I'm going to prepare the dough. All right. Later. - Hi Sarah. - Hi. Where's Bang Mandra? He's here. But he refuses to come in. He doesn't want to be blamed. Who's gonna blame him? Zaenab? Bang Mandra. What are you doing out here? Enjoing the view. Come inside. Your sayur asam is waiting for you. - You shouldn't have. - Let's eat. Okay. Eat, eat eat... - Come in. - This is a beautiful house. - Beautiful. - Let's go to the dining table. Here you go. Alhamdulillah. My favorite food. Sayur asam. - Are these jengkol? - Sit down, Doel. - Okay. We have jengkol. And we have petai. Of course. In Holland, we can get jengkol. - May I start eating? - Of course. - This is a complete menu. - That's your sayur asam. - Sit down and eat, Hans. - Sorry if I start first. You're not eating, Doel? You should eat. You can't get this kind of food here often. - Dig in. - Thank you. Just before you avoided this house like a disease. And now you're happy like you've just seen angel. Don't be a joker. Excuse me. She got tempe! It is the first time I see tempe here. Salted fish. Thank God. You're not eating with us? No, I'm on diet. Are these bread? You're not going to eat those food with bread. You've got your rice. But there's bread and sayur asam on the same table. I'm confused. Excuse me. Here's your jengkol. - They look like your face. - Quit it. Petai. What is this? I thought that's a mangosteen. It's an eggpant. Fried chicken. I've never eat this kind of food since I got here. This is very good. You should eat too. He's home. He'll come inside in a minute. He's parking his bike outside. Hey, kid. Hey, Uncle. Honey, I want you to meet these people. Are you confused? You must be thinking, what's primitive doing in here? [ Mom, Is this my dad? ] [ No. The other one ] Doel. Come again? - His name is Doel. - Same as yours, Doel. Hi. Hi. Hi. Have lunch with us. He can speak Indonesian. But I think he just doesn't feel like it today. The surprised look on his face though. He looked at me and grossed out. Don't laugh. I'm sorry for his behavior. But he thought you were his dad. He was dead wrong. Is he blind or something? I have nothing to do with it. Hey Tong. This man is your father. He's my cousin. You should call me Engkong. You know? Go ahead and eat. I'm not hungry. Where have you been going since you got here? Alhamdulillah, we went to many places. But there's one thing I've been wanted to see. It's the red light district. You mentioned that earlier. Yeah, the red light district. What have you done, Hans? - You're crazy. - I know, the big nose. Have you tried cruising on the canal? No. What do I expect to see? You can cruise along the canal and enjoying the view. I'd love to see that. But I don't know about Doel. I'll go wherever he'll go. When do you have to return home? The day after tomorrow. What? That's too early. Don't you want to go to other places? Can you extend your vacation? Bang Mandra, do you want to extend your vacation? I do. But that depends on him. Since I just tag along with him. Well Doel? Will you extend your vacation? I have to go back to Jakarta. I have a lot things to do back home. What things? You're not driving oplet nor working in office. A freelance technician job is just sit and wait for a phone call. I'd rather we extend our vacation. It's a free vacation after all. Hans can take care of your tickets. You don't mind to be here longer, do you? You haven't got enough time to get to know each other with Doel. You go. I don't feel like it. Excuse us. What did he say? I heard something with "jing"? Are you kidding? You've been holding that phone since I went in the bathroom. If you miss him so much, why don't you call him? Or you can take a shower. Who knows after you've freshened up, Bang Doel might call you. That's not funny. I hate to see you like that. You look like wrinkled clothes needed to be ironed. Stop teasing me. I hope Bang Doel is okay. As your uncle, if I may give you a suggestion... you'd better spend the night here. Who knows if your son still wants to get to know you better... talk, and catching up with you. Don't worry about your wife. If nobody tells her, then she'll never know. I won't say anything. You're just gonna be here to catch up with them, that's all. He's right. I know that kid has been longing to see you. You should understand why he stormed out like that. Maybe he was upset because you won't change your schedule. She also told you she would take you to the train station. Don't worry, you won't get lost. Though I know who will. He's right. Spend the night here, talk heart to heart. Till dawn if you must. Pour your heart out. But, remember, don't do anything you'll regret. Don't get in bed with her. Okay? Hans, let's go. I don't want to look at his sad face all day. You look as sad as an antique statue. Let's go, Hans. I'll meet you at the train station tomorrow. If you really want to go back with Hans... just go. I have no right to make you stay. I think Bang Doel meet Sarah there. That's what you think. You don't know the fact. But my gut feelling never fails me. So what if they meet? Is that a problem for you? Not really. But the truth is, he's so fragile. He's sensitive. You might not believe this. But he always asked me about his father. And he always wants to meet his father. I hope you'd understand. I understand, and I'm sorry. Don't worry, Nab. Bang Doel won't go back together with Sarah. I think he just wants to know how his son is doing. It's okay if they want to get back together. I'll understand. Bang Doel never could get over her. He still loves her. You're weird. You said you'd understand if they get back together. But look at you, crying. I have to go to bed. Please close the front door before you go to bed. And you have a contract marriage with Zaenab too. It's okay. I understand. Because it was my fault. I was so angry with you because you helped her... ... when she had miscarriage. At that time I didn't think, what if you wasn't there to help her? She might not survive. Thanks. Rest now. - Your coffee, Doel. - Thank you. - Morning, Mom. - Good morning, sweetheart. Aren't you going to have breakfast? Later, at school. I'm leaving now, Ma. Say goodbye to your Father. I'm going Ma. We can't go to the airport to say goodbye to you tomorrow. It's okay. Please forgive our son, Doel. He needs more time to accept the truth. - I hope you'd understand. - I do. Doel... All I want from you is... From now on, I'm just your sister, and your best friend. And please allow me to visit your mother. I really need to apologize to her for letting her down. Give my best to Atun. I'm so sad Mas Karyo is gone. Give my best to Zaenab too. - Again, please forgive me. - Yes. I wasn't a good wife for you. - It was my fault. I pushed you away. - No, it wasn't your fault. It was all mine. Forgive me. I tried to forget you, but I couldn't. I didn't realized, the more I tried to hate you,... the more I love you. But I promise, I'm trying to forget you. Okay? I have to go. Your tram is about to leave. I've never meant to hurt three women in my life. Who I respect, love, and care so much. Nyak, I travel all across the world to right the wrong I've done. I went to find your grandson that I believe is there somewhere... ... and is growing up to be a man. Sarah,... forgive me for all I've done to you. Our foolishness and our anger,... kept us apart for far too long and made our lives miserable. Zaenab, I know I hurt you for doing this. However, I have a son that I need to take care. Doel, my son. I'm not offended or angry if you were rude to me. I'm to blame for making you wonder about who your father is. Forgive your father. Sarah and your son are not here to say goodbye? They have things to do. That's what hate about children who are being raised abroad. - They have no manners at all. - He has school today. - If had a child... - Father Doel. I'm so sorry. I was rude to you when you were in my house. Forgive me. I really wish you could stay here. I have to go home. And I'm looking forward to see you again next year. Your mother told me that you will go to high school in Jakarta. - We'll be together again next year. - But I want you to stay here. There, there. You don't want your father to be late for his flight. We'll go home to Jakarta next year. You want that? Go home to Jakarta for good, with me? It's okay. Say goodbye. I think you're going to need this document. Please divorce me, Doel. Let's go sweetheart. You don't want to be late for school. Hans. Bang Mandra. Doel, time to go. Thank you for accepting our work for the past 26 years. Though we can only hear your voices, you will never be forgotten...
