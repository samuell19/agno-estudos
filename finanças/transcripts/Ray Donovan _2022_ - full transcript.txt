Ray Ray. Hello? Who is this? I gotta ask you something. Ray? I tell you something I did... something bad... you gotta tell the cops? Ray, where are you? Doesn't matter. I did it. What did you do? I killed my father. Shit runs downhill. Father to son. Father to daughter. What do you need, sweetheart? To not be awake. Please just leave me alone. You all right? I'm not gonna be able to do it, Ray. Do what? You and I both know I won't make it in prison. It's taken care of. What is? You're leaving tonight. Where? LA, for now. Lena will meet you at the gate with another ticket and a passport. Okay, so where the fuck am I going? Maybe it's better if you don't know for now. Be not inhospitable to strangers, lest they be angels in disguise. To Smitty. To Smitty. You got old, huh? You owe me 80 bucks. What for? - My Cutlass. - What? You double-parked my Cutlass in front of the Stop & Shop. I don't recall, Matty. I didn't, neither, till I got pulled over two years later. $20 ticket times four. Oh. Okay, yeah. Here. Here's 53. You know I'm good for the 27. I know what you're good for, Mick, and it ain't money. That's where you're wrong, Matty. Look here. The fuck is that? Something for your ex-wives to fight over. How much you looking for here? Jim's son Kevin was gonna give me 20 mil. We were right in the middle of the draw. Yeah? And then we hit that little snag. And what was that? I think you must've heard, Matty. Heard what? Declan got shot. So who shot Declan? Your son? Yeah. Which one? Daryll. The Black one? Right. Why the fuck would he do that? Crime of passion, Matty. Declan killed his girl. You can't hold a man accountable for getting vengeance over love. Well, Jim Sullivan won't see it that way. You wanna move those papers, you're gonna have to go through Declan's people to do it. I got no problem with that. Do you? You don't think they'd be loyal to Declan? I'm thinking it's paper worth 20 mil. At that number, no one's fucking loyal. Grandpa Michael wasn't a mobster. Sure he was. No, he was just a mean son of a bitch. Oh, come on. He was in the mob. - He wasn't. - He was. He wasn't. Sorry, Bunch. He used to work the door at Rose's hotel. Mm-hmm. Wow. I remember that fucking place. No, you don't. You was too young. Yeah, actually I do. Mom, she used to drop me and Bridge off there when she had shit to do. We'd sit at the bar and drink cokes with the cocktail waitresses. Waitresses? Oh, and they fucking played gin all day long. I mean, they taught us. I remember there was... there was... there were two Black ones, and there were two white ones and they were obese. But fuck it. They were nice cocktail waitresses. They weren't cocktail waitresses, Bunch. Yeah, and that hotel, it wasn't no hotel. No. It was a fuckin' whorehouse? Proud descendants of whoremongers on your grandmother's side. Did you know that, Daryll? You're two generations away from being a pimp. Two? One. Yeah, he was a pimp. It all makes sense, though, when you think about it. What? I mean, raised in a whorehouse? Beat every day? It's probably the reason Mickey is the way that he is. Dancing. What? That's what he should've done. Mick should've been an instructor at Arthur Murray. Ballroom shit? He'd be good at that. With the leather pants and a disco ball buckle on it? Cheatin' old ladies outta their husbands' money. Yeah. Hey, hey. Don't worry, darling. 'Cause it's all in the hips. Oh, you fucking call that hips? Give me a break. Oh, hey, hey, it's electric. No, it's not. It's fucking pornographic. Take it back! Oh! - And up! - Oh! Bring it back now. Take it back, take it back, take it back. Oh! And hey! You're up. What are you doing? Nothing. We were just... No, I know. I'm sorry. I know what you're doing. I'm just, um, trying to figure out why. Bridge. We didn't mean anything by it, Bridge. Why is it so easy for you to forget? Forget what, sweetheart? Someone's life. To just... drink it all away as if someone's life is just another bullshit story to tell. Another notch in Mickey's belt. Along with... with all the other stories, all the... whores and killers and thieves that you're so fucking proud of. That is what Mickey did to you. All of you. That's what makes you so alike. He taught you how to forget. Hey. Were there many people at the funeral? Just us. We're postponing Declan's till we find my father. Ray, you there? You home? Yeah. I'll be right over. Everything is such a mess. There's something I gotta tell you. What? About your father. What is it, Ray? He's gone, isn't he? My father's gone. We did everything Mickey said. We gave him everything that he wanted. I'll get you the papers back. I don't... I don't care about the fucking money, Ray. Are you coming? She would've been better off if she never met me. What does that mean, Ray? I got what I had coming. What did you have coming? Ray Ray. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly. Everybody's looking at you. They're thinking you ain't got balls. That what you want 'em to think? Ray Ray, trust me, all right? I'll catch ya. Come on, kid. Trust me. There is a time for everything. A time to be born. A time to die. A time to plant. And a time to pluck up the thing that has been planted. Body of Christ. Body of Christ. Body of Christ. Amen. Body of Christ. Who the fuck are you? My name's Ray Donovan. Mick's son? Yeah. The one who moved out West? To become an agent or something? Someone told me you were banging that broad from the movies. The one from the cult show. What's her name with the big... You heard from my father? Mick? Not in 15 years. Why, did you lose him or something? What's that for? If you see him. Stay strong, stay strong. We all loved her, Raymond. I've been transferred to another diocese in Pennsylvania. I'm so sorry to be leaving. I'm gonna miss you and the boys. You have been an angel to this family, Raymond. I hope you know that. To all of us. - You're fucking late. - For what? That shitshow? You think I'm gonna sit in there and watch that cocksucker desecrate my daughter's body? At least he was there. She was my baby, Raymond. That fucking fairy's got no business going anywhere near my babies. Never seemed to bother you before. You're a piece of shit, Mick. You always have been. What do you want, boy? Huh? I should've killed him then. And then what? I don't know. Maybe none of this would've happened. You're probably right. None of it would have happened. No wife, no kids, no life. Probably better for everyone if I had. That's some sacrifice, Ray. You'd be willing to give up all those years... ...all that life... ...just for him? What can I get you? Whiskey, please. Neat. Was that Matty Gleeson who just walked out of here? What? Am I fucking Facebook all of a sudden? Am I asking the wrong guy? Was my makeup running or something? No. Sorry. I'm Evelynne. What's your name? Ray. Well, you look like you had a rough day, Ray. Yeah? You mind? Sure. My day was a fuckin' doozy. Pfft. A real four-star shitshow. Yeah? Work over at the Gap. Manager now, you know? It's all right. The benefits don't suck. Keeps the rent paid. And I get 40 percent off the clothes, which, you know. But today, it was like the fucking running of the bulls. This whole busload full of Japanese tourists. You'd think they'd never seen a pair of flat-front khakis before. I mean, what the hell do you think we are? What did you say your name was? I didn't. Well, whoever you are, finish your drink. We're closing. For the bottle. Nice to meet you, Evelynne. Yeah. Come on, dance with me. Dance with your girlfriend. Come on, Ray. Hey. Ray. Ray? Come on. Look at me. Look at me, baby. Look at me. You all right? Yeah. I'll be right back. I'm gonna use the girls' room. Hey, how you guys doing? Bridget was good people. Wore her heart on her sleeve. Never a bad word about anyone. Never. She loved you. She was proud of you. Hey. She was. Sláinte. Sláinte. You look like shit, by the way. Can I ask you something? Sure. Colleen? What about her? Why? Why? She's a whore. A fucking coke fiend and a half-wit. So why? Seriously. Why? I don't know, Abby. You don't know? I don't know. It's honest, at least. It's honest. You know what happens if my father finds out he's dealing coke in the bathroom, right? I mean, he's a romantic, your father. - Yeah? - Yeah. Come on, let's get the fuck out of here. He may be a cocksucker, Ray, but he sure loves being alive. Do you? "Do you?" That's what she said? Yeah. What do you think she meant by that? I don't know. She let him in. Let who in? Calabasas. I thought that if we could get away, we'd be all right. But... ...she let the wolf in. Opened the fucking door for him. Who's the wolf, Ray? Ray? How is she? How's who? Bridge. She's asleep. She okay? Yeah, she's okay. Good. Where are you? Boston. Fuck you doing in Boston? Don't worry about it. Go back to sleep, Bunch. Look at this fucking guy. Come on, Arty. These fucking twinkletoes. Look at him. Hey, all right, fellas. Hey, it's nice to see you. - All right, all right. - Let's go. All right, I'm coming, I'm coming. Jesus. Oh, fuck. Paint the street fuckin' red. Hey, what the fuck is this about? I was just coming to see you. You've been a busy fucking boy, Mick. What the fuck you talking about? I'm talking about the 50 French blenders you stole from the back of Sam's truck. Oh, the Cuisinarts? Yes, the fucking Cuisinarts. When you gonna get it through your thick fucking skull these guys are not to mess with, huh? Oh, Jesus Christ. That's what you're upset about? Hey, Jim. Jim, I need you to, uh, just do me a favor. Broaden your fuckin' horizons for a minute. What? All right. All right. I need to talk to you for a second, Jim. Oh, fuck. Hey Ray Ray. How are the boys? Jim, sit down. Jesus. All right. So the other day, um, I'm sitting there in the Taco Grande and minding my own business eating my chimichanga in the corner. And who do you think walks in the front door? What the fuck are you talking about? - Ezra Goldman. - Who? Ezra fucking... I don't know. Some Hollywood Jew. It's not important. What is important is that they are shooting a movie right here in Southie. So? So what the fuck do they know about Southie? I'm talking to this guy for ten minutes and already he hires me on as Sean Walker's personal technical consultant. Who? - Sean Walker. - Yeah. - The movie star Sean Walker. - Movie star Sean Walker. Supposed to be some kind of vigilante priest or something. Yeah. Black Mass, they're calling it. Huh? And I'm telling you, these guys are loaded, Jimmy. A major motion picture here. Trucks up and down E Street loaded with expensive equipment and no fucking security. Oh, come on. Camera, lights, you know, trailers, these guys even carry their own fucking kitchens around. You wanna make a play for a hit on 'em, huh? Well, I talk to this Ezra guy, he, uh, brings the security contracts to you. Boom shakalaka, you catch my drift? And, uh, what do you think, Jim? Ray here would make a hell of a bodyguard. Might even put in a word with Sean Walker himself. Ray, you know anything about these movie trucks coming in? I saw a couple of trucks over on E Street. How many trucks we talking about? Oh, come on Teresa. Don't do that. I just want to talk to my daughter, all right? Please. I'm not drunk. I'm lonely, and I miss her. When my mother died, my Aunt Rose told us we had to stay up all night watching the body. And when I asked her why, she said, "Well, that's what wakes are for. To watch the body. To make sure they don't wake up." We were terrified that she'd start twitching at any moment. But also half hoping that she would wake up again. Rose went downstairs and starting cooking stew. Oh, the smell. The whole neighborhood must have smelled that stew because by four in the morning, we had a full house. And everyone brought something. Booze, a bag, box of something. Cakes, cookies. I came downstairs and everyone was there sharing stories about my mom. I never knew I had so much family. But you were right, what you said about us. That we forget. There's a difference between drinking to forget and remembering someone the way they ought to be remembered. Ray. Ray... Raymond. He's not here. Where'd he go? Boston. What? He went to Boston. When? I don't know. Last night. He called me, that's where he told me he was. Raymond, it's your brother. What the fuck are you doing in Boston? Mickey. What? Mickey's in Boston. He's got those fucking papers. That's probably why Ray went up there. No, he's not going up there for that. Do you know much those things are fucking worth? No. He's not going up there for the money, Bunch. He's gonna kill Mickey. You gotta go up there. Right fucking now. Oh, let me just call. No, he's not answering. You don't go, then I gotta go. All right, all right, calm down. My dad's in Boston? Why? We don't know, Bridge. Bunch is going up there to find out. I'm going with you. No, Bridge, that's not a good idea. I'm coming. No, sweetheart. It's not safe. I don't care. Where the fuck you going? Get up, you piece of shit. Ray? Get in the fucking car! Get in the fucking car! - Come on! - I'm getting in. - Get in! - I'm in. I'm in. Stand him up. Hey! Move! Move! Get out of the fucking way! Fuck! Matty, you fuck. Fuck. - Hey. - Fuck. Raymond. Oh, shit. Son of a bitch. No, no! You want some gum or something? Oh, hey, you can hook my phone up to the Bluetooth. Is this Mickey? It's his briefcase. What's in his briefcase? Papers. What papers? Stocks he wants to trade for money. If he hasn't traded it already for coke and whores, you know. Do you think some people are just bad? Yeah, I do. Coke and whores. What do you want? Hey Kev, it's Mick. Yeah, that was some kind of fuckup we got caught in, huh? You know, it had nothing to do with you and me. No? I mean, Daryll was out for blood. Shit between him and your brother. We just got caught, wrong place wrong time, right? Fuck you. Still want those papers? You're out of your mind. I'm having a fire sale, if you're interested. 75 percent off, today only. Where are you? Boston. Was that Mickey Donovan? What does he want? He wants to sell us our money back. Fuck. Dad? - Bridge? - Where are you? Boston. I need to talk to Bunch. Are you okay? I'm fine, sweetheart. Where's Bunch? Did you do it? Did I do what? Kill Mickey. No. Tell Bunch to call me, all right? Tell him I need him to come get me. Hold traffic! Pictures up! We're rolling, guys. Roll sound! Action! This is... this is bullshit. Cut! Cut! Cut! So you just want me to walk up to him, shoot him in the back, and then walk away? Yes, Sean, yes. You reach into your robe like so. Just as you approach, you shoot him in the back. Then you put the gun back into your robe and you simply continue down the street as if nothing at all had transpired. That ain't how it works. No? Shoot a guy in the back? That's, uh, a warning. You wanna make him dead, you gotta put two in the head. That's what I thought. Not even a stupid fucking priest is just gonna walk down the street and pull out a gun where anyone can see. Sean, we have worked this out and it will be best if the blocking... I want to hear what he has to say. Show me. All right. Uh... - Hey. - Don't worry. You'll get it back. Come on, give me the gun. Jesus. It's rubber! Fuck. It looks real. I'll be you. Come on. You know what to do. All right. Great. Action. Pow! Pow! Second one in the head. Everybody's looking at the car. No one's the wiser. That's what I was talking about. Hello? Bridget took my car, my phone, and my gun. What? We were on our way to come get you. What for? To keep you out of prison, that's what for. Why the fuck would you bring Bridge? She didn't really give me a fucking option, Ray, all right? Look, we're both worried about you. What was... what was I gonna say? All right. All right. Where are you? Boston. I need you to get my car. It's at South Station. Keys in the console. And come to the Gardner Motel, room 46, all right? People who forget. Who just wipe their heads clean. What do you call that? Repressed memory? Yeah, repressed. What are you thinking about? Something my daughter said. What? What did she say? That I was taught to forget. Taught? You didn't have much of a choice, Ray. Trauma's a thief. The younger you are when it starts and the longer it went on... the more memory it will take from you. Jesus, Ray. What the fuck happened? It's not important. Yeah, but did you find Mick? No. What about Bridge? Nothing. Is that her? Yeah? Your father called. When? He's selling the papers back to me. I told him to meet me at our house in Wellesley. I thought you'd wanna know. I gotta go. Whoa, wait, what's going on? Give me the keys. I gotta go. No, I'm coming with you. No. You stay here. Keep trying Bridge. Lena. Hey. Passport, Social Security papers, and birth certificate. This is your access code to your Bancaribe account. I want you to memorize it and throw the paper away. Bancaribe. Okay. Now, I already checked you in and made sure your passport cleared, but they're gonna check it again at the gate. - Caracas? - They don't extradite. - Okay. - All right. What I want you to do is go through security and stop for nothing, not even the fucking bathroom. You're gonna get to the gate, you're gonna go on the plane and pretend you're asleep. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. So when... when can I come back? What? I... I can't come back? Not unless you wanna spend the rest of your life in prison. Daryll, don't fuck around. Just get through security and lay low until your flight. - Okay? - Okay. Hello? Hey. I'm in Boston. So? So I'm... I'm standing on the porch of the house where I grew up. And I... I don't know, I got to thinking... ...what if I could get a do-over? You know, what if I bought the house back, hmm? What if I tried again? I really think we could make some beautiful family memories here. Brendan, you know it doesn't work that way. You know that. Well, what if it did? If it did, we'd all go back to the shithole we grew up in and live happily ever after, every single one of us. You wanna come out here and visit? Come out here. I ain't making no promises, but come out here and you get a job, and get some help. Maybe I get some help. Maybe. Maybe. Best I can do. Might not be a good time, Mr. Goldman. Call me Ezra, please. Might not be a good time, Ezra. I'm sorry, I don't remember your name. Ray. Of course. Ray. Mickey was just teaching me how to talk Southie. Let's go to the packies for some jimmies so I can bang the wicked hot cashier at Dunkies. You ready? What? I thought we'd have some dinner over at Nona's, maybe take in the town a little? Sorry, Ezra. Not tonight. No? I'm working. You know that. I'm doing the whole method thing, and Mickey, he's... Of course. Do your thing, bubala. I love you. Have fun. You can take the rest of the night off, too, Ray. Thanks for everything. Yeah, just take the rest of the night off, Ray. Do me a favor. Keep an eye on that one, and call me if anything comes up. I'll take care of it, Mr. Goldman. Ray. You know what chutzpah is? No, sir. Well, you've got it. Don't worry, it's a good thing. Oh, you're bad. You're gonna get me in trouble. Whoo! Oh, I got fucking stories. True ones! None of the priests I know are fucking vigilantes. Ray! Vigilantes? Hi, baby. They're too busy putting their dicks where they don't belong. What? You gotta help me out here, Ray. They had enough fucking coke to last them till fucking New Year's. I gotta close. They're all corrupt. Yeah, all right. It's why you need guys like me to keep the scorecard even, you know? Ted wants to close up. Oh, not unless he's out of fucking whiskey, he's not. Not unless he's out of fucking whiskey, he's not. Time to go. Hey, oh, how do... what do you say... Southie slang for cash? Cash. Uh, I will give you, my good sir, a grand of cash, if you let us stay another hour. Ray, lock up. Come on, Ray. When are we ever gonna party with a movie star again? Yeah, Ray, when are we ever gonna get to party with a movie star again? Sure. Where's Mick? He's gone. He told me it was yours. What? The money. He told me it was yours. He didn't take it? No. It is yours, isn't it, Ray? What? It's what you've been after all along, isn't it? No. You wanted the money and you helped him. Just say it. Look, Molly. Ray, where is he? I'm so tired. I just... I just want you to tell me what you've done to my father. I'm sorry. Ray. Oh. Ray, where is he? I just want you to tell me what you've done to my father. Do you? Do you? What did you do, Ray? What did you do, Raymond? What did you do? What? I banged it back like you said. Yeah, but you're still drinking it. You oughta open your mouth and throw the whiskey back in there like you're trying to splash the back of your throat. You dance good, Mick. Even if it doesn't really match the song. Oh! Oh, shit. - Sorry. - You all right? Sorry, sweetheart. Take a seat, Mickey. Gotta sit this one out. Mm, I need a cigarette. Who's got a cigarette? Okay. Your father's a fucking character. You know, I'm basing my whole performance on him. Yeah? His tough-but-heart-of-gold stuff, you know? He's got him good, Ray. Oh, my God, that's perfect. Don't do that. You shoot a guy in the back, that's a warning. You wanna make him dead, pop him in the head. Put the gun down. It rhymes, you know? Two in the head, make 'em dead. Two in the head, make 'em dead. Two in the head, make 'em... Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I killed her. Oh, my fucking God. My life. My fucking life. Oh, my God. Ray, Ray, what am I gonna do, Ray? What am I gonna do? I didn't mean to. I swear to God, Ray. Jesus Christ. I'm going to prison. I'm going to fucking prison. I'm going to prison. Give me the gun. Give it to me. You were in your trailer. You had a few too many with Mick and you slept there. - What? - Say it. I got drunk in my trailer with Mickey and I... I slept there. - Hello? - Mr. Goldman. You better meet Sean in his trailer. Now! I'll call you later with a place we can talk. Ray Ray. Ray Ray. Ray. You okay? Ray. You all right? Unlock the door. Unlock it. You okay? Huh? I gotta call Ezra. Come on. I'll help ya, I'll help ya. Here, here. Here. Here. Just lie down. Just lie... Let me see what you got, Ray. Let me see it. Here. This is bad, Ray Ray. I gotta find Bridge. Listen to me, Ray Ray. This is bad. We gotta get you to a hospital. No hospitals, Mick. Put pressure on this. I'm gonna get some towels. Come on, trust me. You're a good boy. Don't let no one tell you something different. You were an angel. Mick. What, son? I know... I know you tried. You get that money, huh? No, I didn't take it. It was yours. You deserve it. No, I don't. Yes, you do. You deserve the whole world. What I did... What you did? You looked after, Ray. You looked after us. No. What I did to you. I want you to know... ...you didn't deserve that. What? Fish gotta swim. Yeah. You remember, fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly. I got to love one man till I die. Stay with me, Ray. Stay with me. Stay with me. ♪♪ Can't help loving that man of mine ♪♪ ♪♪ Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow ♪♪ ♪♪ Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know ♪♪ ♪♪ Can't help loving that man of mine ♪♪ When he goes away. When he goes away, that's a rainy day. But when he comes back, the day is fine. The sun will shine. What did you do? It had to stop. It had to end. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Hey, hey. I'm gonna be all right. Get her outta here, Bunch. Please. You hear me? Get her outta here. Dad. You're gonna be all right. Go. Go. Ray, are you there? I know you tried to help me. Please keep talking to me. I... I didn't tell him. You didn't tell him what? I didn't tell him... that I love him. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did to him. I... What did you do to him? I put him away. He didn't deserve that. Wasn't his fault, but I... I did it. Even if I didn't shoot him, I ended his life 30 years ago. What do you mean, "Even if you didn't shoot him"? Room 46... Ray. ...Gardner Motel, Boston. No. No, wait. Listen... Hands, hands! Let me see your hands! Gun! He's got a gun! Freeze!
