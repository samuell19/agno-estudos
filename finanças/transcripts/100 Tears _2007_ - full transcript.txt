I'm right here, please! I need your help, I'm in here! -My God, what happened? -I don't know. He came in. He sat down, and he shot himself. Serial killers. No, it won't sell. All I'm saying is that why can't the Titanic rise from the depths and sail again? Okay, we've made up some real shit stories before, but this one takes the fucking cake. I have to put my foot down Mark, no way. Oh come on, Jen. Okay, fine. Reptile Boy! I can't believe I'm still writing about this fucking shit. Well, it's better than the Titanic gargle. Are you serious? Okay, I have this. I know okay but, I'd really think it would be cool if we did an expose on serial killers. -Okay, I have all this stuff. -No. I have things on the Coney Island Slayer, and I'm not talking about just the Teardrop Killer. Okay, I've compiled all this info with the help of my sister on, I have things about the Slaughter sisters, okay the Kentucky cannibal family. I mean, look at this guy, look at his picture. When you read the article this is really good stuff. This is what pays the bills. Mark, just go with me on this. Okay, we've been doing this tabloid crap for five years. I mean, really don't you think it's about time that our work count for something more than supermarket checkout lines and bathroom reading? Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll go with you on this but we have one week to get a cover story to the "Midnight Star". Okay, what do we got. -Titanic. -Reptile Boy. Come on. It's a little hokey, heart-throbbing, people will think of Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, -steamy car sex. -Crazy car sex. Fine. I can't remember the last time I had crazy car sex. Okay anyway, you know there's been this huge rise in the last year of unsolved homicides. I really think this is our time. It's a sign. Is this what you do late at night when I'm sleeping? Yeah, this and masturbate. Okay anyway, I've got all this information. If we can just help me organize it, like, into sections and liner notes, that would be so fantastic. You know, if you were ugly, I'd say no fucking way. Well, good thing I have the looks then, huh? And the brains. Well, I don't know about that. Are you gonna eat that? I just want two of these here. No, help yourself. Looks good. -What's up, Legs? -What's going on? Nothing much. I got two weeks left in this place, -and I'm out. -Really? I got six months. I can't wait to get outta here. Jack. No, has Jimmy got the stuff? Alright, cool. Can be here in 15 minutes. Alright, love you, too, bye. Yeah, if you want me to be happy -to see me? -Awesome. -Have you seen Chino? -No, why? It's time for my shot and he has my insulin. Why in the hell did you give that crackhead your insulin? He's not a crackhead, he's just misunderstood. -Come on, let's go find him. -Alright. Girl, I swear to god. I'm telling you, Clarence, you're gonna get hooked up today, man. I'm making this Puerto Rican thing called sancocho. Mwah, my mama, man. I can. Right. Ooh, check this out. Some of these homicides are pretty close to home. Six months ago, there was a slaying just outside the State Fairgrounds. Three girls were butchered limb from limb. Oddly enough, when they put the bodies back together, some of the parts didn't match, which means there was a fourth victim. However, there were only enough bits to put three girls back together. Where the fourth victim went, no one knows. Fuck! Yeah, Spaulding had mentioned something about that. Fuck you, come on mother, fucker! Maybe some people are born like, bad apples, you know? Too many long hugs from Uncle Johnny? Don't worry, little boy, it'll be alright. But what makes them tick? What causes them to do it? Are you even listening to me? Yes, I'm listening. I don't get much time -to do this, you know. -Shut up. Oh shit. Hey man. Dang. So nasty. You should come look at this stuff. Fuck, fuck. What's up, cracker? Cracker? Who you callin' cracker, cracker? You. Hey so Sarah, how is it in the clean? Usual bullshit, man. They're trying to pin a B&E. Remember the last time, Dave broke into the liquor store last week? Shit girl that was shady. I saw all the liquor in his room. Motherfucker. No wonder they knew that stuff was here. They caught me on the scene of the crime, fuckin' cops. Whoa ho, nice man! Hey, kid's park is across the street, alright man? What, pissed off 'cause the kids didn't leave you a piece of cake or something? Hey shitheads, remember me? Girl who needs a shot? Fork it over? Hey, you two stay right here. -Good idea. -Don't you go running away on me now. Ugh, shit, fuck! Fuck! Oh my god, they even have a picture of that bloody teardrop that he drew on the wall. Since then, 168 cases have been related to the Teardrop Killings. No other evidence has ever been found. The fuck? Fuck. Oh fuck, fuck! Go! Come on, come on! Come on, you fucker! Fast, fucker! Fuck. Shit. Shit, shit! Fuck, oh. Fuck. The local investigators did find trace evidence of a grease paint. That was the only thing out of the ordinary. I don't get it, grease paint? God, no. Please, don't, leave me... Please don't. Please! Please don't! Please, please! Holy shit, I just mopped here! Shit, what happened here? You crazy clown bastard! I just mopped these floors! If you're gonna rub one out, can I at least watch? If you did a few of these, you might get a girlfriend. Well let's see, there's a sexy girl doing Jazzercise in her panties in my living room, so I'd say the only thing we have to do to solidify this relationship is have some crazy monkey sex and we call it good. If you did a hundred of these, I'd do you in the shower. If I did a hundred of those, you'd have to do me in the hospital. By the way, should I get you a bib? You love my saliva. Hey, I did some researching last night. Oh, you're kidding. No, I did some, I found, I found this-- It's that right there. Oh my god. Ah, you're a bastard. Don't worry, I'll get you back. I swear to God, if you do that again, I'm gonna shit on your pillow. Nice. -Who is it? -I don't know. It's your big sis. FBI is calling. Oh wow, there was a brutal slaying at a local halfway house right up the road. We need to go check it out. So, put your pants on and let's go. Duncan! What's up buddy? How are you doing? Mark, you know I can't let you in. -Duncan! -Jennifer, on the other hand, well that's a different story. How's my favorite reporter doing? You know we're not gonna touch anything. The bodies are already gone. Nothing left to see. Come on, crime scene's not even here yet. There's gotta be something to look at. You guys know I can't let you in. What do you got? -Jackson. -Franklin. -Garfield. -The cat? Ha ha, funny. -Just give him the 50. -No! -It's for the video game. -Video game or crime scene? Come on! Hold my camera. -Hope you're happy. -Ecstatic. She's gonna take your report. I'm gonna go look around. -Hey! -What? I'm just going inside. Not a word of this Spaulding. Oh never. Hey, maybe we should get a cup of coffee sometime. Yeah sure. Mmhmm. Hey. Jesus Christ! Don't you knock before you come to a place? -Scared, little baby? -No. -Hmm. -A little bit, yes. Maybe a little. Let's get outta here. -Did you get enough? -Yeah. So did, uh, Duncan have anything to say? Besides asking me out on a date, not much. Although he did say there were two more people unaccounted for. Huh. Jack? Jack! Jack, wake up! We have to get out of here! -Jill? -Jack! What, what, what is it? What's happening? Jack, I'm so cold. My legs, my legs are so cold. Don't worry, baby. It'll, it'll be okay, don't worry. Jack, Jack, what is it? I love you, I love you! You mean, if we can get free, we can make a run for it! -We-- -Sure! Don't, don't worry baby, we'll get outta here. We're gonna be okay. -No! -Don't you touch her! Don't you touch her! Jack! Well, maybe they spent the night somewhere else, got a hotel. Well if they did, lucky them. I just don't see how they could afford it by the look of the clientele here. You're just saying that 'cause there's blood and guts everywhere. I'm telling you, if you slapped a fresh new coat of paint on this place, it's good as new. Should we continue, smart ass? -Yes. -Which way? That way. Oh, my god, Mark! Fuck is going on? You guys doing a sweep? I'm sorry, sweetie. What the fuck is going on? What the hell? I didn't know there was a little girl in there! It was a clown, he was killing everybody! I'm sorry baby, I'll keep you safe. You guys need to be a little more thorough, man. Man, I'll call dispatch and get someone over here right away, alright? -He was killing everybody! -Don't worry, sweetie. You'll be safe now. No, not Jack! Jack! -Fuck you, fuck you! -Jack! No! Please! Please, please. I'll do whatever you want, please. I'll do anything you want. No, no! No! No! Mom, I'm going out for a little bit. You look like a clown. -I like clowns. -Where are you going? Just going out with girls for a little bit, get some drinks and who knows? Well, you be careful out there honey. There's a lot of lunatics out there today. Mom, it's not the lunatics I'm worried about. It's the sane people. They're the ones who need the ax to the head. Take a look at this. So, I've been doing cross references on circus and carnival runs against times and locations. -Okay, did you make this? -Yes. It's pretty awesome. -Okay. -Well, how come the police haven't figured this out? I have no idea. Have you seen the police work? They're fucking idiots. -Duncan is a retard. -I'm serious. I don't know, any of those related? -They connected in any? -Yeah but only two, Roxanna Dugan and Tracy Greaston. -Okay. -Roxanna was murdered. Tracy identified her body. They were like best friends in 1985. I don't know, here read this. They joined some traveling circus. The police found the body of Roxana Dugan in the woods. According to the reports, she's the first real victim of the Teardrop killings. Huh. Interesting. You should call your sister, she's a fed. She might be able to help us out. Yeah. Oh fuck! -I got this. -What? I stole it off the registration desk -at the halfway house. -What is it? It's a list of all the residents. Maybe we can cross-reference it to any of the murders that have happened in the past. Maybe someone is connected to some of these people. See, this is why I love you. I know. Oh and by the way, I looked up the circus boat that was listed on the report. -Mmhmm? -And some of them live in Gibsontown. He's got unfinished business. And I bet you this Tracy chick, I bet you she's in Gibtown. You know, that explains why the murders happened every few months up and down the coast. Yeah well, the circus does go from town to town. Wait, Faye is a carny. Well, a little girl did say she saw a clown. The circus does start in three days. You know what, in the morning, let's go out to Gibsonton, see what's what. In the meantime, I'm gonna take it dump. Sounds hot. Damn. Hey, hey wake up! Wake the fuck up, wake the fuck up. Oh shit, oh shit. So, let me get this straight. This guy's been killing for 20 years, lays waste to an entire halfway house and nobody knows anything. I don't get it, what's the deal? You know, Tracy Greaston has been missing since 1985. There's like a million people missing in America. He could have killed here years ago and put her under a rock. Okay, that was my sis. Not like you speak Greek to everybody. Okay, my sis said she and the FBI have little to nothing on the guy. They haven't heard anything about any kinda clown, so I guess we have the upper hand, but she did say we should go check it out. You know, just in case. Well, this place looks like fun. Can't be too bad, it's carny folk. -What can I do you for? -Hey. Where would one go to find the locals? What do you mean? Well, we're looking for some information on a clown. Just because we're a circus, do you think we know every clown? Fuck you pal. No, I'm sorry, you're mistaken. We're trying to put a connection together -with the Teardrop Killer. -What are you, FBI? Oh, no sir, we're just reporters. -What paper? -A local one. All papers are local. -What's the name, darling? -"Midnight Star". -Isn't that a tabloid paper? -Yes, yes it is. Well hell darlin', why didn't you say so? I can't take a good shit without having one of them on the crapper. Well, that's a good thing. Tell you what, you see that park over there? -Uh-huh. -You need to talk to Drago. He can set you in the right direction. -Number two. -Number two. Okay great. Alright excellent, thanks, appreciate it. Alright, if you get lost, come on back. We end up with all the strikers here. -Okay, thank you. -Okay, great. P.S., sucker's knee is every New Year's Eve. Well. You wanna hoof it? Yeah, I could use a walk. -So, he say number two? -Number two, not that I see any numbers on any of these. -Yeah, I don't see anything. -I see names. Excuse me, I'm looking for a Drago. -Are you Mr. Drago? -Wait a damn minute. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for a Drago. -What do you want? -Well really, we just wanna ask him some questions. I don't know a Drago. Come on, man, it will only take a minute. I'm not going to jail for this. Jump on back, go! We're going the wrong way! What in the hell is Frodo's problem? Come on, Mark! -Mark, look out! -Come on! Arghh! Fucking cheating as hell, mother fucker! Oh, shit! Ugh, ugh, ugh! That little fuckin' bastard can run. -Tell me about it. -My stomach hurts. I think I'm gonna shit my pants. Come on, let's find him. -Ugh, ah! -Shit! Damn it! -Damn! -Fuck! -Yeah man. -Drago! We're reporters, not the police, if that's what you're worried about. Drago! Fuck, alright I've got to shit. -Drago! -I don't see him. Fuck! Drago! -We just wanna talk. -Yeah, man. I was right on his ass. Not the police, huh? Sure look like the fucking police to me! -We're reporters. -Yeah, right! We work for the "Midnight Star". Oh, so why didn't you say so? What the fuck you doing up there? I'm looking for your ass. Well, in case you haven't noticed, I'm short. Next time you're looking for a dwarf, stay low. How can I help you? Well, we've come to the understanding that you might have some information -on the Teardrop Killer. -Teardrop Killer? I don't know nothing about a Teardrop Killer, lady. Well, we've heard that there's some kind of connection -with him in this area. -Sorry, lady, I have no idea. Hey, man, you made me come all the way out here chase your ass for a fucking mile not to get any answers. So you got two choices. One, you give us something, or two, I'm gonna shove your ass into a coal truck. Coal truck? What is this, 1933? Engines run on gasoline now. -Whatever, give us something. -Yeah, come on man. I'll tell you what. Give me some time, I'll go ask around, and if you guys come back tomorrow, and then we'll do lunch. You can't help us out? He wants us to come back tomorrow. What, fine. Come back tomorrow, and then we'll do lunch. -Fine. -Fine, fine! Whatever. Hey, can you guys find your way back? Fuck you. -Your coffee. -Thank you. You're welcome. -Coffee, there you go. -Thanks. -No problem. -Damn it! I don't wanna wait an entire day to check this out. We need to find some more evidence, something. Well, we can contact that Tracy woman. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. She might be able to help us out. Good to see you again, how you doing? -Good, how are you. -Good. -Good to see you. -Alright. -There it is, guys, huh? -Yeah. As you can see this place has been vacant for quite some time. That's why we came down so much on the price. When's the last time you were out here? Honestly it's gotta be probably but a year ago, but as you can see the place is well used, so you guys should be able to get comfortable on it. -Is the power still on? -Yeah. Yeah we keep it on for people that wanna look around. When was this place built, you know? The early 1900s, actually. -Really? -Yeah, yeah. It's been around for a while. -It's got character. -Character? -What do you think, William? -Don't really care. So, as you guys can see this place is absolutely sound, you know, -structurally at least. -Yep. But, I gotta go make a phone call, so if you guys wanna just take a look around, -I'll meet you out front. -Sounds good. -Alright, thanks, guys. -See you in a bit. Oh yeah, Michael, where's this door lead over here? That's the water works, just pipes and stuff like that. I don't usually go down there, it kinda freaks me out. -Have a look see. -Alright. Whoo. Oh! Fuck, it smells like piss, piss and dead animals. Yeah, these assholes wanna go look in the basement, so probably gonna be here about another half hour. Then I have that lunch then with Lucy, so probably not gonna be back in the office today, so, but their file is in a blue folder on my desk, so if you can take it-- What the fuck! -That's probably Mike. -Yeah. -I'll find you, okay? -Okay. Mike? Mike? What the fuck are you supposed to be? I think we have some issues to deal with. Yeah, like those fucking nosy FBI guys. Those weren't FBI, trust me. How do you know? Because when the FBI walks in, they flash their badges at everything, you, me, Fido, your potted plant, even the fucking fridge. Well, all I know is they were asking about the Teardrop Killer. Well, we don't know any Teardrop Killer, do us? Look, we ain't got nothing to give them. I'm sorry but they're gonna have to write about fish boy or the truckstop girl this week. And what if he comes for us? Gurdy's not coming back to us. Easy for you to say. You wasn't dragged in the middle of all this. But then Gurdy, we took care of that long ago. Well, it's someone who knows an awful lot about Gurdy, 'cause he's sure doing the things that Gurdy would have done. Gurdy's been dead 20 years. Okay, you know what, fuck it. If you're so sure that he's dead, then why don't you just tell me everything that needs to know about Luther Baxter. What do you mean, "If I'm sure?" -Forget it. -God damn it, Drago. 20 years we've kept Johnny Law out of our business. Justice was done, eye for an eye, carny law. Well, if Luther Baxter is dead, then who is wanting him back? The murders have never stopped. Maybe, but they ain't never come home. Well right now, too close to home, too close to Tracy's home. Okay, I think I found her. There's like six Tracy Greastons, but all unlisted numbers. Well, if you were almost killed by a crazy serial killer, wouldn't you wanna not be found? -Yeah, good point. -Yes, thank you. Well, let's get started. I wanna get out to Hell's Hideaway before it gets too late. What the fuck? Luther! Hey there, lady, looks like you need a ride. Maybe, where you headed? Wherever you wanna go. Wherever you're driving, honey. Well, hop in. What's wrong? Never seen a pretty girl before? What, no, I mean yes. Don't worry. I don't bite. You seem nervous. I can help. So are you a working girl? Just drive, loverboy. I know a place we can go, it's up ahead on that road. Alright. I guess that's a no. I guess so. Luther, wait, wait, Luther. Before you kill me, I got something for you. Don't kill me, I got something. She's still alive. Go on, take it. Well, why don't you tell me what you want? -Do you like what you see? -Oh yeah. Hey! All good things come to those who wait. Oh come on, baby. There's no one here. She obviously doesn't live here. It's a T-shirt shop. -Where to now? -Three down, two to go. Awesome. -Alright. -One more stop. Let's go. -Cross that off the list. -Yeah. Hurry, come quick, you missed him. Who, Drago? Did he take off running again. -No no no, he was here. -Fuck! It's a mess, man, it's a mess. Mark, the keys. Hey, fucker! Can you kill the bright lights in here? I have one hell of a headache. Jesus, Drago, are you okay? No, I'm not okay. -Wait, he didn't kill you? -No, but he should have. -Well, why didn't he? -Hey, hey, hey! -Thanks a lot, lady. -Well, that's not -what I meant. -Don't push it. I gave her up so that he wouldn't kill me, not that he would have anyways. Gave who up, Tracy Greaston? What, how do you know her? Well, we didn't know, but now we do. We just cross-referenced our asses for about a day. You two, y'all should be detectives. -I told you. -Okay, wait. What do you mean you gave her up? Y'all two don't get it, do y'all? -Get what? -The Teardrop Killer is Luther Edward Baxter, also known as Gurdy the Clown. That little girl said she saw a clown that night. Yeah he's a clown. She changed her name to Samantha. We meant Tracy about 20 years ago. They said that they wanted to go into circus. Tracy she, she liked the Gurdy, and Roxy, she liked Ralphio. You know Ralphio, he was our strong guy. He was charming and the ladies really loved him. They really did. And I think that's one of the reasons why Tracy and Roxanne, that's why he joined the circus. You know if you ask me, they were just wanting to bang their way up the East Coast, but anyway Tracy took a liking to Gurdy. That's when the shit hit the fan. You see, Tracy and Gurdy, they hooked up one night. And Roxanna that bitch, she hated Gurdy from the beginning. She got jealous and came screeching, yelling something about a rape something. And of course the first one she ran into was Raphael. -Gurdy is raping Tracy! -What? He's over this way, come on! Of course Ralphio, the big strong macho guy, and the both of them they steamrolled over to the tent. Ralphio, he went all monkey nuts and started beating up on Gurdy without giving him a chance to explain. Well later that night, Gurdy, he got he got even-Steven. The first one to bite the big one was Roxanne. That bitch had it coming. She had it coming. And then, Ralphio, yeah he got it, stabbed right to the back of the head. At that point, Gurdy and I, we both knew that he had to leave the circus. He had to get out of town. Ralphio was very liked. The circus was not gonna be the same without the strongman. So later on that night, we got him out of here alright. Haven't seen him since. You know, he can never really stay away from the circus. Every time that we traveled, he's there. We may never see him, he's there. Is he on her way to her house right now? I have something for you. -It may not be too late. -What is it? -When did he leave? -About 30 minutes ago. Fuck, call Spaulding. Tell him to meet us at Tracy Greaston's house. There still may be time. Well, we could be too late for the whole fucking thing. Drago, you might wanna think about hiring a maid. This fucking place is atrocious. Hey, if you guys find out anything, I got a midnight show at the circus. Great, thanks. -Ugh. -Take care of yourself. Give me back the-- Put me down, let me go! Let me go! Get off of me! Get off! What the hell is this? It looks like the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Does it, Daddy? Hey buddy, no sleeping. Aw fuck, there goes my lunch hour. Tracy? Which door? -It's locked. -This one too. Ms. Greaston! Nothing. I don't get it. There's a TV on. Look, door is open. Should we go in? You go. Now we go in. -Nice move. -Thanks. -Shit, why'd you do that? -I'm sorry! Wait, is she dead? She's not doing the cha-cha! Well, you don't know, check! Well do I look like an EMT? Okay. -Call Spaulding. -Right. Hey guys, you have a nice night tonight. Drink that shit, man, chug that shit! That's what's up, dude. Well, looks like we got some catching up to do, doesn't it, Daddy? Listen guys, I really appreciate all the help, but if any of the higher-ups find out that you two snooped around at the halfway house, we're all gonna be in trouble, okay? This just means there's a serial killer on the loose. Really? Yeah, this is the seventh case we've had just like this one. We had one other day and now two tonight. -Oh, well that's interesting. -Mmhmm. Excuse me, I've gotta get inside. -Fuckin' Duncan! -Well, what do you expect? My $50 back! So you're saying seven more just like this. Yeah, with the smiley faces cut from ear to ear. When was the last one? I'm not sure, sometime between nine and 10. -Where? -Over in the port. There's a second person living here. Mrs. Greaston had a 21 year old daughter. -Her name is Christine. -Hey. Get this, she does seem to be missing. Well that explains why the door was open. -Well she's as good as dead. -That's awfully negative. Well, I'd say there isn't a sweeping merit badge on that belt there, brownie. Well, he was here alright. We need to find the daughter. Uh, I don't see you two wearing badges. Oh, I'm sorry. I must have missed that shopping trip to Toys R Us. -I was busy that day. -You want some of this? -Are you serious? -Neither you want any of this, okay? Back off! Listen you know what, I want my, oh fuck is my wallet? How about I give you $50 to blow me? Still owe me 50, asshole. Duncan is a dick! You were kinda tough tonight. You know, I've never seen that before. Well, fuck shit pissed me off. Wait, what do you mean? I can be tough. I'm tough. I'm just saying, it was different. So what are we supposed to do, wait until he kills again? God, this sucks so bad. Well alright, Jennifer. Let's just take showers, call it a night, and do some more research into the morning? Research what? Missing children who have been kidnapped by crazy-ass psycho clowns? Okay, I don't think they have a website for that. God, now I'm pissed. Well then, forget it, because homicide is all over it now, and the FBI and your sister will be all over everything tomorrow, so we're out of the picture. -Wait, are you giving up? -Yeah, you know what? You know what? I'd rather write about mutant moon men who have disco parties on Mars than to have to put up with this shit any longer. Well I don't fucking want to write about that shit, Mark! I'm sick of it. God I want something real, you know? I'm taking a shower. Wait! Mark, let's just go back out to Hell's Hideaway and talk to Drago. Jen, forget it! It's ridiculous! He's a killer, he's killing people! Just give me another chance. -I gave you a chance. -Where's it gonna lead? I don't know, but it's time we take that chance. God, we've waited so long, Mark. Ladies and gentlemen, step right up, and I'll introduce to you the final show tonight. The most amazing and fantastic show on Earth, but wait no more for a sight which the likes have never been seen before. You will never find another scene like this ever! I give you-- So, what do you guys think? I'll take an order of the twins to-go. -Tracy Greaston is dead. -What the fuck you mean, -"She's dead"? -Your clown killed her. Nah, I don't believe it. -What, why not? -'Cause he wouldn't. You mean he never got around to it. No, I mean he wouldn't. He loved her. Yeah okay, so a serial killer with the deductive reasoning not to kill the woman he loves, that sounds like a crackpot story to me, buddy. Yeah, like you should know. Animal rights, vampire babies, killing aliens to save livestock? Touche. So he loved her so much he slit her from ear to ear. What, uh no ma'am, that's not his MO. So why was she slit from ear to ear? Who the fuck knows. Maybe somebody else killed her. Yeah, okay. Luther has been the Teardrop Killer for over 20 years, not some smiley guy killer, or Slappy the Carver. So, why didn't you call the fucking cops? Well, one thing you learn is when you work on the road, that we take care of our own, no interference from outside for any reason. Why are you helping us? Times change and conscience weighs heavy, my friend. Now if you guys don't mind, I like to go drink myself into a coma. -I've had a rough night. -So, that's it? That's all I got for you, lady. Why don't you guys just let the cops handle it? Don't even try that route, buddy. That'll get you nowhere. Thanks, Drago. You take care, man. Maybe we'll see you again sometime. Maybe on better terms next time. Yeah, yeah maybe. Take care, man. Goodbye. -Hey. -What's that? Oh, when was that reported? What, so you seriously think it's a connection? No, well we can go out and take a look. Yeah no, give me the address. If anything happens I'll call you, bye.
