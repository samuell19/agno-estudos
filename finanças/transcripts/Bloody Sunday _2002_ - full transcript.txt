Excuse me, folks. Good to see you. How are you? How do? Ladies and gentlemen, Major General Ford. We are marching because, ever since the partition of Ireland, Catholics in the north have suffered discrimination in a Protestant-dominated land; that's why we're marching. In view of the continuing adverse security situation in the Province, all parades, processions and marches will be banned until further notice. We're marching because the British Government promised us reform, and all we've had are excuses and curfews, and the issue at the core of civil rights: Mass internment without trial; that's why we're marching. Anyone either taking part in or organising such an event is liable to immediate arrest. The law must be respected. So we say this to the British Government: We will march peacefully this Sunday and march and march again until Unionist rule is ended in this province, and a system based on civil rights for all is put in its place. Thank you. I say to the leadership of the civil rights organisation, any responsibility for any violence which may take place must rest fairly and squarely on your shoulders. Thank you. ... We shall overcome some day... Yeah, thank you, see you later. ... deep in my heart... - He's grand. - What's wrong? He's just tossing and turning. Gerry, I'll get him. I'll get him. I'll settle him down. - And the mum's home. - Aye. Oh, what a night. Hello! Did you enjoy babysitting? Hello, wee man. Was he good for you? - He was good as gold. - Now he's playing up for me. - Where'd youse go? - The Stardust. The usual. Just for a few drinks. That's all I need on a Saturday night. - I'm just taking Hester back into town. - Be careful. - I will be. - I don't want you getting lifted again. I'll be all right. - Right. - See ya. - Are you going back soon? - Aye. - It'll be a good craic. - Hope they don't kick the boys out. I keep them away. - Come around Jackie's. - Aye, OK. Hi, how're you doing? - Why are you watching out? - I'm a turncoat. - What happens when he bollocks me? - He's your sister's husband. Come on, get a move on! - Looks like the Brits are out tonight. - Aye, you'd better leave me here. - Be careful tomorrow. - I'll be fine. It's only a march. - What if trouble starts? - There'll be none. It's a peaceful march for civil rights. Right. - I'll meet you here tomorrow, about six. - Right. See you tomorrow. Bye. Squadron is not ready yet. Serial 6. Over. Come in 1 - 7, this is 1 Alpha. One of your roadblocks has reported movement of three people in a green Volkswagen Variant 1500. The registered number is Golf Uniform Lima 2155. She was winking, her, I reckon... 1 Alpha, registration number Golf Uniform Lima 2155. Over. Platoon commanders on me, soonest. Let's get moving. Let's get some pace, tell me when we're secure. 6, on me. Get HQ up on the net, now. Move the vehicles out of that line of sight. Tell me when sentries are posted. There is a sniper threat. It's coming from there. Make sure that's covered. Colonel, we're putting the covert OP into the derelicts on William Street. We'll let you know as soon as that's in place. I've got the company in, we're established. I'm going to brief the troop commanders shortly. - Open the door. - Keep it down. - The wee man's asleep is he? - Aye. Hey, the Brits are here. - The pigs are everywhere. - The Bogside's crawling with them. I count a dozen. Four APCs, as well. There's more on Rossville Street. Craigavon Bridge, as well. They're everywhere. - It was on the radio this morning. - Get a move on. - Fuck, are your trousers too tight? - You're just jealous. - Sorry, wee man. - We'll be all right, Mary. One day he'll grow up to be a good stone thrower himself. - Where are you going? - Marching. Back later on. Gerry! - Can you see the army? - Oh, yeah. Look at this! Come on! Brits out! Brits out! Go on back home! Come on, you British scum! Get out! We'll see you later at the Guildhall. It'll take more than rubber bullets and barbed wire to stop us today. Brits out! Come on! Oh, shit. Ma, can you get that? Jesus! Morning, how are you all? Two ticks. Yes, yeah. I know, I know. Ma, I can't see them now. I'll be there. Can I get through here? I just want to get to the phone. OK, we're all getting ready for the march here. How many? Any sign of the Paras? Yeah. What about the square? OK, I'll meet you at Aggro Corner. Folks, I'll be with you. I understand. I'm just getting ready for the march. Right. I know. I'm gonna sort it. They've been waiting for over an hour, lvan. Tell them I'm going to see the Bishop. No, the Cardinal. Oh, aye, the Pope. They mightn't believe you, but it's worth a try. All right, Dad? I'm grand. - It's just a Sunday afternoon stroll. - Have you no coat? - I'll be fine. I'll see youse later. - Take care. - I will. - Look after yourself. I know, I'm sorry. - Have you a moment? - Surgery's cancelled. - It's about my TV. - We're marching for civil rights, not TVs. All right, Mrs Doherty. Sleep well? - Aye. Coming to mass? - A good Protestant like me? All right, folks. See you later. March against internment. There you are, son. See you later. There's the church. And we're in this yard here. The proposed route of the march is along here, then along the street, which runs that way. Our job is to catch these hooligans and pincer them between ourselves and 'C' Company. So, through the wall, down the street, and hopefully we'll catch them. William Street runs parallel behind this wall. Machine gun platoon will make the breach with their pigs, we'll follow on foot. 150 yards of waste ground, through the derelict buildings, and we'll be behind the marchers. So what about the Stickies and PIRA in the Bogside? - Well, they're there. - Will they be out today? They're bound to be and we've got to be ready for them. The primary job is picking up 200-300 of the Derry Young Hooligans. Tell the lads we want maximum aggression and a lot of arrests, and if the shooting starts we're going to shoot back, plenty of rounds. How do? Morning, ladies. There you are. Hi, ladies. OK, see you later. All right, boys. Have some of these. Walk away, don't be intimidated. Sorry, excuse me. It's OK, I know him. This is a peaceful march today. I hope you're the same. Lads, I know him, it's all right. He's drunk. I'll take him away. Walk away. Thank you. It's a peaceful march. Hey! Go home, sleep it off. See you later. How are you, folks? Don't worry. It's a peaceful march. Don't rise to it. Don't be intimidated. I'll see youse later. Thank you. There you are. The Bogside is a fucking mess. We must get a grip of it and teach these people a lesson. Make sure the guys know who these fuckers' leaders are. Let's get 'em. Everyone needs to recognise these key players. I want them lifted off the street today. We're gonna have these guys. Make sure the guys know. I want all of them in the bag. Clear? It's the end of our tour. Let's teach them a fucking lesson. Let's make the CO proud and show the brigade what 1 Para are made of. Is that clear? Any questions? We're going on our own? 'Paul' Company, 'Charlie' Company, that's it. All right, boys. Stewards. - Jesus! - We've got a pressure-cooker situation. - Bear with me one minute. - So? Whole city's shut down. No one's getting in or out. They've got Normandy landings down there. That's gonna be the flashpoint. The march is coming down here, these guys will be here. - Nobody's getting through. - Do we have enough stewards? - Get the others here quickly. - Is that the Provos? - The Provos are sniffing about. - Why? - They think the Brits have invaded. - I've seen William Street. Have you spoken to them yet? I will. See you there. - Stress that we're in control. - Yeah. My name's lvan Cooper. I'm Member of Parliament for this area. Could you move this back a bit? No. You're participating in an illegal march. Back off from the barricade. What gives you the right to stop us marching in our city? The sooner we can march, the sooner we'll have civil rights. It's a basic principle of democracy. Right. Thank you. Jesus. I can't get through to them. Mrs Hegarty, I hope you're joining us today. I can't. My uncle John's been up puking all night. - Was it the beer? - No, he's sick. Right, Mrs Hegarty. - What are we going to do? - We're going to march. - Are you sure? - We've got to march. If we don't, civil rights is dead in this city. Sort out the stewards. I'm going to talk to the Provos. Keep it up. A huge military build-up. We're surrounded. Keep your eye on the young people, OK? Listen, there's a lot of army around, so be very careful. Thanks. OK. Gerry, I want a wee chat with you. - Wait, lads. - How long have you been out? - Three weeks. - What's the plans? Get a job, but it's hard with my record. Things will pick up, but you've got to be careful you don't get nabbed rioting again. - I'll not be rioting again. - There's many lads rioting on Saturdays. It's just stones. - Gerry, you can't afford to be caught. - I know what you're saying. How do you feel having given yourself up? It's better for the long run. - Pray for us. It's going to be terrible. - Keep an eye on the young people. Now I don't have to worry about getting caught. I can go on about my life. You've done the right thing, and you can't afford to be back there again. I don't want to go back. I'll not be rioting. - Are you going to the march? - Me and all the boys. Be very careful. I'll probably see you down there. - Watch yourself. Bye, Father. - You mind yourself. God bless. - What did he say? - Just asked how I was. Here, boys, listen. No trouble today. I mean it. There's women and children going to be in this march. You're going to make it worse if you start antagonising these boys. Leave them alone. Join us. It's a big day for us. Women and children. I mean it. No acting the eejit. Keep it calmed down. Just checking you're keeping the guns away. That's no concern of yours, lvan. - You gave me your word. - Then take it. We just want a peaceful march. This is our day. People are fed up with the shootings... Convoy's over Craigavon Bridge and there's barricades on William Street. - Any sign of the Paras? - No. Any sign of anything, let me know. All right? Go on. Ivan, it's all very well for you, sitting pretty with your wee Westminster paycheque every week. Marching's not going to solve this thing. Watch us. - Welcome to 'A' Brigade, sir. - Thank you. Here's Maurice. Lieutenant Colonel Steele, sir. - How are you, Pat? - Very well, sir. - It's good to see you. - And you, sir. I've had a briefing from Downing Street. The Prime Minister has had enough of this Londonderry rebellion. Shall we go through? Stand up. Sergeant Major. How are you? - Good to see you again. - And you, sir. - Cup of tea, sir? - Yes, please. - Yes. - Briefing's ready when you are. The men were rather bucked when they heard you were coming across. I'm very pleased to hear it. Everything set for the day? I think so, sir. Their intention at present is to move along William Street into the city centre and on to the Guildhall for their rally. We'll stop them here at barrier 14 with the Royal Green Jackets. - Coldstreams? - Up on the city walls. King's Own are on the north side of William Street. 1 Para are in the Presbyterian churchyard here. 3 Company are behind barrier 14. - If there's any trouble... - There will be. ...support company will break through the wall from the churchyard, through this dead ground, break through this wall, and sweep round behind the hooligans at Aggro Corner, sweeping them towards barrier 14. At the same time, 3 Company will break through barrier 14 and the hooligans will be caught in a pincer movement. I should say, sir, 1 Para only go in if there is violence, and then only if there's a clear separation between the march proper and the hooligans. Do we know who we're looking for? Yeah, we've got OPs at strategic points all along the route, and they've all been briefed on the known players. - They've seen pictures? - Yes. We have a cordon of snipers here should the IRA wish to contribute. Do you know where they're going to be? We are concentrating on the top of this block of flats and possibly Glenfada Park across the road. - Have rubber bullets been issued? - Yes, sir. Maurice, anything I haven't thought of? - Press placement will be important. - Winning the propaganda war. Vital. - Who's in charge of that? - Lieutenant Hector, sir. As per your request, there'll be both local and national coverage on the day. Press from the leading tabloids, the major television companies... Talk to Colonel Tugwell about that. Not now, please. - Good. Thank you. Well done. - Thank you, Michael. We're going to have to be tough today, Pat. Really tough. If there's any trouble at all, the Paras are to counter-attack, is that understood? - Of course, Robert. - Good. And you have my full support, of course. Thank you, sir. Hello, John, Jimmy. How do? How do? - Ivan, good to see you. - How do, folks? They've blocked the Belfast Road, so we've got ten coaches stuck... All right, boys. Get those pencils sharpened. So we've got ten coaches stockpiled at the border. How're you going to get them out? We can't have ten coachloads of marchers doing nothing. - And the stewards? - They're sorted. - We've got Fenner Brockway. - Look after him. Look, give me a couple of minutes. I need to see Frances. I'm all for you, but we need to kick this thing along. Right, just a minute. Right, OK. Very quickly, please. One second. I'll follow you up. Go and sort out 306. Where were you? What happened to you? I had meetings. I'm sorry. We're having a nightmare with this charge. Kevin's not entirely sure what's going on. I have to sort it out. I'm sorry. Change the record, lvan. I'm sick of it. Wait, Frances. Give me a couple of minutes. - I have no time. - I know that. - I have no time. - I'll be finished about eight. That's balls. You'll still be in the bar at 12 listening to your own voice. Will people turn out for you? I think so. They always do and this is our big push. This is a march with peace and for civil rights. Excuse me. - An hour to be safe. - That's not fair to say that. Take that. Don't talk to me about fair. I'm a Catholic girl. Look at me and say that again. I know you're a Catholic. That's the whole point. I am up to my eyes. You're not the only one. I have the world's press in here wanting things done yesterday. Come on, I know it's hard, but one last big push. Just one second. Take care of that, please. You're getting very late. The British Army has surrounded the city. That shows you they're very threatened by our voice. That's about them, not us. It's a peaceful march against internment and for civil rights. They're alleging you're creating a confrontation. What do you think they would say? All right, sorry, folks. This is Fort George, Strand Road RUC station, the Rosemount. So we come in from different routes into town, Shantallow, Rosemount... - That won't work. - It will work. We'll confuse them. I'm saying forget about the Guildhall. I walked through there this morning. There's a massive military presence. If thousands of us go down there, we're not going to get through. It's irresponsible to say it'll be fine, just because we want it to be. We need to look at the realities. There is a very severe dispersal problem. I am not taking a re-route and I am not selling out. - It's not a sell-out. - Wait, Kevin. Say that again. You're not selling out? I've been marching just as long as you and I've never sold anyone out. There are 3,000 British soldiers out there. We'll be cannon-fodder. We re-route, up Rossville Street and hold the meeting at Free Derry Corner, or I walk away and tell my constituents to as well. - All this work, up in smoke. - What are you suggesting? We delegate two people, Bridget can be one, John can be another, to walk down to the Guildhall symbolically. - I hope everybody knows in time. - They will. Let me get that sorted out. Right... Is Lagan there? It's Cooper. You've got Catholics pushing for all sorts of reforms with the IRA behind most of it, and the Protestants who don't want to give an inch. Morning, sir. We can't afford to offend the Protestant majority because they've all the guns! Excuse me. Hello, sir. I'll take you to the Brigadier. Chief Superintendent Lagan, sir. Hello, Frank. I don't think you've met Major General Ford, Commander Land Forces. This is Chief Superintendent Lagan. I've heard a lot about you from your Chief Constable. It's time for us to go. I heard from the march organisers earlier today. Sir, I heard from the civil rights leaders today. They're anxious to avoid a confrontation. They'll avoid the Guildhall and stay within the Bogside. It's so useful to have contacts in the community. Maurice. - Unless he's Roman Catholic. - What's that all about then? Patrick, what's that all about? Lt'll be low-key. - Low-key. The Paras, low-key? - Yes, I know. All the call signs are in place and the Paras have confirmed the churchyard. You know the Paras aren't a low-key regiment. They're the best for the kind of mass arrest we've got to carry out. Listen, I know the people of Derry. I've spent the last three years trying to keep the lid on the trouble. Why ban this march in the first place? To keep some Protestant politicians hanging onto power by their fingertips. They're the reason we're in this mess in the first place. Why not just let the march go ahead? If you want prosecutions then I'll take photographs of the ringleaders. Sir, the General wants a word. Thank you, Sergeant Major. I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands. It's a war, Frank. We're taking casualties every week. We've lost 43 British soldiers. I'm having to write too many letters. I'm sorry, we have to draw the line. - Sir, the General is going to go. - Yes, thank you, Sergeant Major. I'm sick of being shot at, spat on and all the other shit. It's about time we went out there... They get away with it and this time they ain't going to. Hit 'em hard. - Get the first one straight in. - Take no shit. - This is just civil rights, though. - They're all troublemakers anyway. - They're all mixed in together. - They're just kids. What about that major that died? And the lads last week? - Where's their civil rights? - I'm just saying they're kids. - You're either with us or you're not. - I'm with you. - You better be. - I'm up for it. Everyone the other side of this wall is enemy. - I can't see a kid being an enemy. - If they're in the way, they're in the way. You've got to stick with us. Whatever happens, we'll sort it out between us. It'll come naturally. When we come through that wall, they'll shit themselves. We get out there and kick some arse. - Did you go to mass today? - Aye. - Who says it? - Father Bradley. - He's nice. - Aye. He was asking me how I was. - Wondering if you'd got a job yet? - No, he wasn't. You're going to get that wee girl into trouble, you know. You know what I mean. - You're not my ma. - But I'm all you've got. She doesn't have horns. But she's from Irish Street and you're from the Bogside. But she's Protestant. I've nothing against her, she's a nice girl. I just don't want you to get into trouble. - Are you getting married? - Aye. - What would your mum and dad say? - Leave them out of it. - She's just looking out for you. - You stay out of it. I'm just worried. I worry about you every time you go outside. I don't want anything to happen to you. Everyone worries about their children. I just want to look after you and Dennis and defend this area from the likes of him. - What do you mean? - Working for the Brits. It's working for the Brits puts food on the table. Can we not have this conversation at the table, please? I suppose you think throwing stones is going to solve something. It's kept them out of here for a while. If it wasn't for us, you wouldn't still be living here. - You really believe that? - Aye. Right. OK. I'm going out. I'll see you later. - I'll be all right. - Look after yourself. I don't want you back in prison. You can't marry her from in there. I'll be all right. Don't worry. I'll chat to you after. Yeah. Oh, yes. Hi. Now, Mike, I don't know. Somewhere between ten and a million. OK, talk to you later. Bye. - All right? - There's your tea. - You OK? - Yeah. What time are you going? About an hour. What about you? I'm on duty till 2.30. Derry Journal and Irish News want to talk to you. - What, now? - No, they can wait. Listen, I know it's hard. That's why I was pissed off with you last night. - I know, I'm sorry. - That's all right. OK. Yeah. Frank, yes. Is it the Paras? Well, Jesus, Frank, who the hell's running this thing? That was Lagan. He says the army are very hard line. We should think about cancelling. No way, lvan, you can't. You can't cancel. I often think I should give this up. Every day I think, I wish I could take her to the pictures. Then I think, what if someone sees, decides to have a go because you're Catholic? Where are the stewards going? Talk to Kevin about that. Make sure they know exactly what's happening. Who's going in front of the lorry, who's going behind. Talk to Kevin now. I'll give him a ring, then you have a word with him. Kevin, I've spoken to Lagan. He says the Paras are in town. Listen, the stewards must know what they're doing when they form the line. Seriously, Kevin, get on that now. Bye. What would I do? Catholic girl. Protestant civil rights Fenian lover. That's why I go to the meetings and the marches. Because I think we're worth marching for. Yes. I'll be down in about an hour. Get Bridget on to them. Give them a cup of tea. Or a drink, even better. My father was in the UVF, for Christ's sake. I've marched in flute bands. Your brother was shot by the RUC. So I don't take you out. We don't go to the pictures. I go to the meetings. And I'm always thinking, if I could just sort this. Just one day, maybe soon, we can be normal. And we won't have to worry. Make sure all people joining the demonstration are channelled in safely, keeping clear of that fenced area, please. Thank you. We want everybody safe here today, thank you. Come on, sort that area out, please. There is a start and an end to the demonstration. All right, folks? God, will you look at this? - Make sure you got that. - I will. - Ivan, will you sign this for me? - Certainly, with love and kisses. - How're you feeling? - Like Martin Luther King. - Was he Catholic? - All civil rights people are. Except me, and I've a special dispensation from the Pope. - Glad you could make it. - Wouldn't miss it. Ready for another march? - Ivan. Great, great! - All set? - So would you have pulled out? - And disappoint all these people? - You bastard! - No, I'm just a politician. Christ, look! What an atmosphere. Look at the amount of people. I think I see... Youse marching down with us? No, we'll stay here in case the Brits try anything. - We'll be down later. - We'll have sent them home by then. - They should be doing a bit more. - We do all the work. - After what happened at Magilligan. - Are you up for it? Up for it? I'll be up on the front line. Brits out! Brits out! What do you think, Gerry? Brits out? - Aye. - We'll get the Brits out together. Look at all that then. Sweep all the way right down. We shall overcome We shall overcome We shall overcome some day My God, they'll never stop us now, boy. The whole Bogside is here. ... we shall overcome some day Moving now, over. The crowd are on the move. - We have a go. - All right, gentlemen. Sergeant Major, pass it on, the crowd's on the move. Pass it out to the OP, the crowd's on the move. Here we go. Make sure all call signs know the march is on the move. What do we want? Rights! When do we want them? Now! Keep the front of the lorry clear, please. Willie, come here. Get the whole stream the whole way up. I can't see the end of it. Boys, could you ask for more than that? Come on, boys. This is a great day for Ireland. The crowd is now half-way down William Street. Over. They're about here now. Crowd is waving, chanting, but causing no particular aggro. Over. See? Tell the people they can't march, and they come out in droves. We're approaching some British soldier positions. Keep your calm. 6 - 5, this is 6 - 1 Yankee, crowd approaching your location. Over. So, in your opinion, we will not get a pig through the wall? Over. Roger. Shit! Colonel. From the OP. They've just checked the wall in front of here. There is a three-foot drop. When we try and get the pig through, it just ain't gonna get through. We still need to cut them off from either side. We'll have to go over the top. Let's get ready to cut through this wire and go over this wall. Now. What do we want? Rights! When do we want them? Now! Do you think we'll have much bother today, John? No, but we'll get a riot going. There's plenty of troops about. - Are you worried about getting caught? - I don't want to go back inside. - You shouldn't have given yourself up. - Aye. Just enjoy the day. We're here for our civil rights today, right, boys? Give us a hand with these ladders. Jesus, there's a lot of them, isn't there? Come on, move it, move it! We're just going right at the corner here. Give me that mike, I need it. Here, keep them steady now. - Stewards! - Keep it there. Keep it going. See that? How provocative is that? What the hell is that, lads? Paras? Brits out! We don't want these here! The column is passing one of my four locations and there's a small amount of stoning going on. That's the Paras getting stoned from up here, sir. Why are 1 Para showing themselves? They're OPs and wire cutters. If the crowd sees the Paras that will inflame the situation, Patrick. Column approaching Aggro Corner. - This is where we hope they'll turn? - That's what they said. People, we're just going right at the corner here. - Keep back, folks. - Keep 'em moving. People, we're turning right here. The march is proceeding to the right. If you don't go right, you have no part in this demonstration. - They're turning the wrong way. - We're going to the Guildhall. Come on, push through them. Come on, Gerry. You have no part in this demonstration if you go down there. Give 'em hell. A small number from the middle of the crowd are breaking away. Running down towards Serial 1 - 4. Over. - This demonstration is turning right. - Ivan, I told you this would happen. Keep 'em coming this way. Follow peacefully to the right. - Keep coming this way. - Just relax, man. We've got to keep the crowd going. If the truck keeps going, they will follow. You stay here. I'm going down to the barrier. OK, everyone behind the lorry. Follow the lorry. Listen. No... We must stick together. Stick together, folks. We're not splitting up. No trouble today. We're not going to the Guildhall. Stay behind the lorry. We're sticking together. No, wrong way. You're supposed to go back to Free Derry Corner. They've passed barrier 12 and they're heading directly for us. - As we predicted. - Good job we planned this contingency. Stand the men by. So this is... - This isn't the march... - This is the breakaway group. They're trying to get to the Guildhall. Yobbos trying to cause some trouble. Get out, you British bastards! - Get back! - Out, out, Brits out! - Have you got your stones? - I've got stones. George, for God's sake, we've got to get these boys back. Excuse me, I'm lvan Cooper, Member of Parliament. Will you give me some time? Cut that out! Disperse! You must disperse! - Take a shot. Are youse ready? - Calm down, Jim. I have reports of the crowd becoming hostile at zero 14. Throwing bricks etc. Over. How many yobbos are that way up towards the barrier from us? I want to find out how many we're going to scoop up if we go now. Contact the barriers at 12 and 14. Tell them to be ready to move those barriers fast if we need them. Round me, please. It's kicked off at barrier 14. We're going in soon. We've got to sort out the stone throwers, all right? ... Special Powers Act, Northern Ireland. Processions and parades are banned until further notice. We will enforce this ban vigorously, and anyone organising or taking part in such an event is liable to immediate arrest. - Do we still have stoning at 14? - We do, sir. Send in Neptune. Get back. Forget the Guildhall. Come on, Gerry. It's all right. We need stones. You're making matters worse. Will you get back! Go on, go on, go on. Ok, folks, keep it coming, nice and slow. ... I still believe... ... that we shall overcome some day Free Derry Corner. That's where the meeting is. Up to Free Derry Corner. Come on. Get away from there! Come on. Neptune has cleared William Street. The main body have disappeared down Rossville Street, leaving behind a hard-core element of hooligans who've gone up to 12, 13, and a large element at 14. - This is escalating. - Rubber bullets at discretion. - I can't get caught. - You won't get caught. Fire! Jesus! Holy fuck! Keep going! Roger that. I'll give you a sitrep when we get there. The riot's developing back towards barrier 12 and towards Rossville Street. Let's go round there. CS gas at discretion. - What are you doing? - I'm trying to use minimum force. This is no good, they're not moving. We'll go round this way. We'll go round the other way to the Guildhall. How many yobbos? 300-400 yobbos. - OK, perfect. - We're getting close. - Give me the radio. - Sergeant Major. Get the sergeants and the troop commanders in. Hello, Zero, this is 6 - 5 Sunray speaking. We're ready. We want to go on the scoop up. We want to go now on the scoop up. Over. I'm choking. I'm choking. - Stay there. - I'm dying here. - They're taking photographs! - Look at the squaddies. Hello, Zero, this is 6 - 5 Sunray speaking. We are ready to move now with three call signs. Can we go? Over. 6 - 5 are to go nowhere. 6 - 5 stay where they are. ... they are being stoned by around 50 in that area. If we don't go in hard, we're going to have tears. Get the guys psyched up, re-brief them on the update. - They're not letting us go yet. - For Christ's sake! Frances, come here. You're all right! Shambles! They broke through the stewards' line, kids everywhere, the Brits then start... - Why do they overreact? - Because they're scared. Imagine people starting to march in Manchester or London? It's so provocative. Anyway, I think we're all right. Come on, get that wire cut! Fucking contact! - What the fuck was that? - OPs returning fire. That wasn't rubber bullets. That was something different. It's John. He's been hit. He's dead. Come on! He says someone's shot. - What happened? - The army shot him. Jesus, help him up. Get him up. Get him up. Get him out of the road. - Who done it? - The army shot him. - They shot an old man. - Can you hear me, Damien? Move your back there. The man's been shot by the look of things. I can't believe they shot my cousin. - The boys are going in! - They shot my cousin! - The boys are going in! - They've shot the old man! 5 - 6 Bravo, confirm your situation. What were the rounds we just heard? The OP has just fired five rounds, they've inflicted two casualties. I think it was nail bombs or shooting. They're getting a lot of aggro. They're firing baton rounds, too. That's one in-coming. Get down off the wall. One round across the wall. What are you doing? It's unauthorised, for Christ's sake! - Get the car here! - Get your hands off me! They shot the old man! There's women and children out there. You bastards! Fucking bastards! You fucking shot my cousin! You bastards, fucking shot my cousin! Brits out! Brits out! It's time for the Paras to go in. They've got a lot of aggro just the other side of the wall, some kids. Shall we get them down? They've got that wall covered. - We won't get across safely. - We'll use vehicles. So we're not going over the wall? No. Support company in the vehicles, 'A' and 'C' on foot. We're not going over the wall. We're going up James Street, through barrier 12, where the Light Air Defence Regiment is, down Little James Street, and scoop up with 'Charlie' Company at Aggro Corner in 2 minutes. Inform the OP there's a change of plan. We're taking the whole company through barrier 12. Listen, gentlemen. Hello, Zero, this is 6 - 5 Sunray speaking. We've got to go now or we're gonna miss them. - The lads want to go. - Hold on. - Who's this? - 6 - 5. Paras, sir. - No, no, wait. - Tell Sunray to hold his position. Fucking people at Brigade! Tell 1 and 3 to move to the barriers on foot. We'll go to 12 in the vehicle. We'll move now. - OK, let's move now. - Hello, Zero, this is Sunray speaking. We are moving forward to the barriers now. We've got to go. Out. - All right, let's go. - Move it! - Come on! - Move! Check your gear! - Come on! - Let's go! Zero, this is 6 - 5. Sunray has deployed his units... - On whose authority? - ... in preparation for your orders. - Why have 1 Para? - Hold your position. Out. I want to know who this has come from. Tell them to wait at the barriers until we give the word. I'll push my way through here. You come up. I'll see you up there. All right, folks. Let us through there. Ok, ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause, please... Let's go, 6. Right, go up to the barriers and tell the gunners to move it, now. Hello, Zero, this is 6 - 5, we're ready to go now. - Let's go! - Let's move! What's the waiting for? Come on! Put your hands together and give a warm welcome to Eamonn McCann, Bridget Bond... They're starting to thin out. We must go... ...Bernadette Devlin, and a man who needs no introduction, so I won't give him one, lvan Cooper. We've marched a long way together, folks, so I'm going to get this started... - Look at this fucking lot. - Just waiting for the off. It's been a difficult day, but a glorious one here in Derry. All of us coming down the hill together. Men, women and children marching. Mrs Hammer, I haven't seen you march like that since '68. But let's not forget in all this confusion that we face a choice as a society. Not about what we want. We all know that. Radical change. The dismantling of Stormont and an end to Unionist domination. Find out if call signs 1 and 3 are in position and ready to move. The choice is about how we achieve it. Between violence and non-violence. If we are going to give a future to the children of this city, the young lads up there, rioting, they do it every day, if we're to give them a future, we have to show them that non-violence works. - Scumbags! - Come on, let's get out! If we don't, it won't be just stones they're throwing. Because civil rights isn't the soft option, not when the bricks fly and the police and army batons charge down. It's not easy keeping to the non-violent road when people say, "Let's use the guns and take revenge." Fucking shot my cousin! But if you believe in the civil rights movement with your heart and soul... - Why aren't they going in? - If we don't go now, we'll miss them. If you believe in what Gandhi and Martin Luther King believed in, as I do, then, in the end, with one single united march, we shall overcome. We're going to have to go. You have as much separation as you're going to get. You can't send them now. You've no idea where they are. You've won, for God's sake. You've stopped the march. Don't do it, Patrick. Don't do it. Load that battle gun. Rubber bullets straight into them when we get out. Come on. - 6 - 5 wishing to move. - Yes, thank you. Michael... Ladies and gentlemen, Bernadette Devlin. We are part of a worldwide movement for civil freedoms. We are protesting against internment of people. Tell Wilford it's just 1 Company and no running battle up Rossville Street. - Through barrier 14? - Yes. Did you log that? I'll do it on the secure link. 6 - 5, this is Zero. 6 - 5, wilco. Out. OK, you're on, let's go. All call signs, prepare to move. Move, move, move! - We're going in, boys! - Let's go! - Come on, come on! - We're away! Don't fuck about, guys. Straight in, hit 'em hard. We know who we're picking up. Come on, 1 Para. Go and get them, and good luck. Scumbags! Let's get out of here. There they are! - What's going on down there? - They're coming in. Stand your ground, people. We've a right to be here. For fuck's sake! Fucking hell! Bastards! - Look, there's thousands of them! - Stand by. - Fucking Free Derry! - We'll show those bastards! - Let's get in there! - Let's get a search team in there. Jesus Christ, it's the Paras! Bastards! Bastards, they're covering the whole road! This block of flats. Jesus, get down! Watch yourselves, boys. Get down! Stand your ground. It's only rubber bullets. And they're firing over your heads. We will not be moved. Get back, get back! They're firing live rounds! - Move it! - Get under cover! - Come on! - Get under cover! Come on, you Protestant fuckers! Get me, you bastards! - Get down! - Get down, get in! - There's a contact by the left flank. - Where? Keep your head down! What the fuck are you doing? Somebody move that wean! - In between the rounds, move back. - Go, go, folks, go! We need to get the kids off the barricades. He's got a weapon! Jesus, they've shot a man! Get down, they're shooting live bullets. Get down! Oh, no, Jesus. He's in a bad way! He's got a weapon! There's no gunmen in sight. I can't see any fucking targets! There's no targets! My God, they're shooting children on the barricades! Jesus Christ, stop it! They're just picking them off! Only aimed shots! What are we firing at? I can't see any fucking targets! They've just hit that young lad there! - You fucking bastards! - Get him out! Get going! - We've got to get him out of here. - Get off the barricades! Get off the barricades! What's his name? - Michael Kelly. - Michael, you're OK. We're going to have to get out of here. They're going to come for me. They're moving off the barricades into the courtyard. - Let's go, come on! - Cease fire! - Cease fire! - They've just called a ceasefire. We have to get away. They're going to come from behind us. They've just called a ceasefire! They've just called a ceasefire! They're shooting people! I have to go. I can't stay! I have to go. I can't stay! - Let me go! - Wait, come back! Jesus, don't shoot! I'm not armed! - Don't shoot! - Fuck, let's get out of here! I've been shot! I've been shot! Get an ambulance! - Look at that steward there! - No! - And they've hit him! - He's got an armband on! - No, get back! - Barney, no! - Oh, God! - Barney, no! I've got to go to him! - Stay back! - Please, lvan, no! - Stay back! - What the hell are you doing? Barney, no, no, no, get back! Get back! No! Stay back, Barney, for God's sake! Jesus! Oh, fuck! Barney, Barney, they shot Barney! Paddy! Zero, this is 9 - 4. Sitrep at 16. 15 on William Street. - They've gone in. - Pigs are in this area, sir. ... Two shots at one of our patrols on the city walls... - They've gone all the way in. - Request immediate sitrep. This is 6 - 5. The two sub-units moved in, got involved in a firefight. Shots appeared to come from the Rossville Flats. The sub-units have now gone secure in that area. Two civilians are lying wounded or dead, we're not sure yet, in the area of Chamberlain Street. Who shot them? We don't know. Over. Get him in, will you? - Come on. - This man is dying. Come on, get him in. - Steady, he's fucking bleeding! - Shot badly. Set him down. Somebody call a doctor. - I want this describing. Here. - Stand still! - Get your hands up! - From this lot, take these prisoners. - Put your hands on your heads! - Right, we'll take these. Put your hands on your heads. Does anyone know his name? It's Willy. I know Willy. It's your doctor here. How are you? You're OK, Willy. - Just relax for me. - Tell my mammy I'm sorry. He's been hit here. Does anyone know this man? - His name's Jim. - Can you hear me, Jim? Oh, my God, Jimmy. They shot my son. They shot my son. They shot my son. - Let's get these bodies moved. - Right, men! Move! Fucking move! - Move! Bloody move! - Sergeant Major! - Fucking mad! - How many rounds did you get down? I had to change magazines. I took a guy out by the phone box and one crawling away. Lovely, Shorty! I went in with the first two rounds... - How many rounds did you use? - Shedloads. What the fuck did you do? - Adrenalin was pumping like mad. - I saw you shoot civvies. - They're not civvies, they're terrorists. - Terrorists? I never even saw a gun. - They were shooting. You were there. - I saw what happened. We went round there, there was about a hundred people. We see a gunman. We went left and right flanks and took him out. You know what happened. Get the story right, 'cause it's bound to come over. Get the OC over here now. Give me a sitrep. Firstly, why have you no comms? Why's there no radio operator? - ITV and BBC want an interview. - I'll be there in 15 minutes. I've got bodies on the barricade. Three, at least, dead. - A man fired shots at us. - Have we the weapon? No, sir. Get a clearing patrol down there now. Secure that area. We need to get the weapons off the shooters. - Right, sir. - Company Sergeant Major. I'm going to see the General and the TV cameras. We've just fired a horrendous amount of ammunition. We've got to know why. And we've got to have some weapons. - OK, sir. - Get on it. What's the situation on the barrier? Picked up three UKMs. Looked fucked, sir. Grey as hell. - We have three dead confirmed? - Yes. Did you find any weapons? - No weapons. - Have you searched the barricade? - Quick as we could, sir. - No hidden weapons, empty cases? - We fired three rounds. - Who were you engaging? - No one, sir. - What do you mean? I had no back-up. I had to move the crowd. 'C' Squadron were arresting guys further back. They were all just coming at us. So you put down rounds to warn the crowd? We'll talk about that later. People are alleging that you went into the Bogside firing indiscriminately. Let's get this absolutely clear, 1 Para went in and came under fire. They did not fire back until fired at. I believe we fired three rounds after receiving something between 10-20. That seems a very low figure. I have seen three dead bodies here today. They may not have been killed by us. We have three dead bodies. - There were another three casualties... - That's all right... General Ford is saying it's urgent you speak to him. You must go. I'm going to the General and the press with three dead. - You've got to find some justification. - I'll report back to you soonest. I can see some photographers at the Rossville Flats. They're taking photographs of a civil rights banner covered in blood. Over. Michael, just get them out of the Bogside. Just get them out now. 6 - 5, this is Zero requesting immediate pull-back. Repeat. Requesting immediate pull-back, please. Over. 6 - 5, request out. Hello, Zero, this is 6 - 1 Delta. The ambulance has crossed The Diamond and is moving along Ferryquay Street. You call that minimum force? Why the Paras today? Because the situation has got completely out of control. Two policemen shot last Thursday. 81 incidents in recent weeks. Law and order had to be reinforced. - Why use live ammunition? - The aggression was brought to us. Our men were attacked by hooligans on the parade. No soldiers were hit. Was there a need to kill innocent civilians? The Paras were fired on first. High- and low-velocity bullets were used. - Were any soldiers hit? - Not to my knowledge. - When can we have a statement? - We'll give you one as soon as we can. Five-niner, roger. That's it. They're pulling us out of the Bogside. Simon, they're pulling us out. Lead on. Move it! There seem to be a large number of casualties. You must understand, we've only just finished this operation. We do not know exactly what happened at this stage. But there are certainly three people killed. Don't you think you might have used excessive force today? What is force in a situation like this? If they fire on us, we'll fire back. They know that. - Was the operation justified? - Of course. - Any regrets about the operation? - Absolutely none. None whatsoever. - He's all right. - We're bringing him out. They're done now. Get him out. - We're going now. - Get the fuck out of here. - Come on. Get him in lads. - Hang on, you're all right. - Get him in. - You're all right. Go, go, go. Hang on there, son. You're going to be all right. Try to keep easy. You're going to be all right. - Oh, fuck, a roadblock! - Just stay calm. - Get out of the car! - We've got to get this man to hospital. You're in fucking hospital! Up against the wall! This one's dying. Scratch one player. He's not carrying, Sarge. Come on, get through, get through. Come on! Lvan Cooper MP, Member of Parliament for this area. - I need to get through. - Where are you going? - I've spoken to your superiors. - You can't go through. Please, let me through. Thank you. We have no list? You've no idea of casualties yet? Excuse me. Will you just? - How many are in there, Father? - Six here. God Almighty! You can't just leave them lying like bits of meat. There's no room. There's six bodies down there. I don't know who they are. They're not Barney. I've been in already. I'm the MP. None of them are Paddy Doherty or Barney McGuigan. That's eight. I don't know how many there are. - Any word about Michael Kelly? - I'll try and find out. What about our Jacky? Jacky Duddy. Jacky Duddy, Michael Kelly. Michael McCaid. OK. Get the numbers down. Do we have a list yet? Thirteen. There's thirteen dead. Fourteen wounded. Are they male or female? - I have the list. - Are they male or female? We have to let people know. Everyone take a family. - Where are those Duddy girls? - Murdering bastards! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look after the Duddy girls. I'm so sorry. Excuse me, please! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Michael Kelly's away. I'm so sorry. Stay back. Show some respect for the dead, please. - I'm sorry. - What are we going to do? My wife. Tell her, lvan. Look, that's a mother, there. The bastards! Bastards! You're in a hospital, you bastards! Go back to England! They shot my dad. Give him a seat. Look at that RUC bastard with a gun. Fuck off! I took my brig right to Glenfada Park to cut off the crowd. When we got round there, there was about 100 people there. Straight away I saw one guy about to throw a bomb in my direction. - Sure? - Definitely. I took immediate action. Dropped to one knee and took a well-aimed shot. The shot hit the guy with the nail bomb in the shoulder. As I came round the corner, two gunmen shot across me. I think it was a short M1 Carbine. I took three aimed shots. Petrol bomb was thrown, landed 10-15 yards away. No one was hurt. There was a second one already lit. I shouted to him to stop, put it down. Fired a couple of shots. He went down... - How many shots? - Four. - And you hit him? - To the best of my knowledge, yes. - How many rounds did you fire? - 22, sir. - 22 rounds? - Yes, sir. How? That's more rounds than they issued you with. Come on, move. Come on. Get round this other... One the other side. Before anybody sees us. Get down there. Go on, move. Can we get some explosives experts over here? Zero, this is 4 - 1 Alpha. Suspected nail bombs at my location. Send Felix now. Hello, Zero, this is 5 - 4 Alpha. One dead person at this location has a nail bomb in his pocket. We request Felix to sort it out. Over. Roger. One round returned as gunman spotted there, but no hits claimed. Over. Where did they come from? They should go fucking home. - No problem. - Can you get me a gun? Lomas, come. Shut the door behind you. At ease, Private. Sit down. I'm W2 Norton. This is Sergeant Bridge who'll be taking a statement. CSM is here for your benefit. In your own words, tell me exactly what happened. I could see through the front of the pig there was a rubble barricade in front, at the end of Rossville Street with thousands of people screaming and shouting. We stopped and debussed just outside the barrier. I went on to the right-hand side of the road, opposite the Rossville Flats which were to our left. As we were going up the right-hand side, there was some sort of commotion on the left, where we assumed a contact had taken place. Then my section commander shouted that there was a sniper on the barricade. - And he returned fire. - Did you at any time see the target? I did swing my rifle to bear around the corner of the wall, that's when we saw what I believed to be a gunman firing... holding a firearm. My platoon commander shouted that he saw 50, possibly more, of the rioters break right towards Glenfada Park and ordered my section to cut them off. When we entered the park, there was a lot of confusion. We saw a lot of people and I didn't witness the beginning of the firefight. At what point was the ceasefire order given? Before or after the shootings? The ceasefire was given after the last shots were fired in Glenfada Park. Private Lomas, in your opinion, were all the rounds fired in accordance with the yellow card? Yes, sir. Well, of course, the loss of life is greatly to be regretted, but I cannot help but think we responded to a very difficult situation. And at least tonight seems to be quiet, suggesting we've moved one step in the right direction of law and order. My main point is that I've seen nothing today that reflects with discredit on our forces, who have behaved, as ever, with restraint and great professionalism. So, please, convey my thanks to the men. You, of course, will be in charge of the inquiry. Issues of timing, when the Paras went in, things of that nature. My role on the day was purely as an observer. Have you anything to add? - No, sir. No. - Congratulations. The war against the IRA will go on. Thank you, gentlemen. - If you want me, sir, I'll be out here. - Thank you, Michael. People, people, please... Please, could you just give us a moment? If you could just have a seat, we'll issue a full statement presently. We will take some questions afterwards, if you'll just bear with us. Just have a seat there for a moment. Thank you. This afternoon, 27 people were shot in this city. Thirteen of them lie dead tonight. They were innocent. We were there. This is our Sharpeville. This is our Amritsar massacre. A moment of truth and a moment of shame. And I just want to say this to the British Government. You know what you've just done, don't you? You have destroyed the civil rights movement. And you've given the IRA the biggest victory it will ever have. All over this city tonight, young men, boys, will be joining the IRA, and you will reap a whirlwind. Thank you. What do you want to say to those people that might be joining? I feel very ill-equipped to do any preaching to them after today. The names of the dead are as follows: Patrick Joseph Doherty, aged 31. Gerard Vincent Donaghy, aged 17. John Francis Duddy, aged 17. Hugh Pius Gilmore, aged 17. James Gerard McKinney, 35. William Anthony McKinney, 26. Kevin Gerard McElhinney, aged 17. Bernard McGuigan, 41. Michael Martin McDaid, 20. Michael Gerald Kelly, 17. William Noel Nash, 19. James Patrick Wray, 22. John Pius Young, 17. Have the families of the dead been informed? They have been notified, at this point, yes. I think it's best we adjourn for a moment. We have some distressed people. So if we can have some sensitivity... - She was saying, "Where's Jack?" - Wait till you get outside. Step aside for one minute, please. What am I going to say to Barney's family, to his kids? You were all there today. You saw it. I would say to yourselves, to British journalists, go home to your people, your government, and tell your people what was done in their name today. The Paratroopers moved in and waited in the streets of Derry to mow us down. I would just like to say this, on behalf of us, the families of the victims and the victims, that we will not rest until justice is done. This is a song I hope one day never to have to sing again. I can't believe the news today I can't close my eyes and make it go away How long, how long must we sing this song? How long, how long? Tonight, we can be as one Tonight Broken bottles under children's feet And bodies strewn across a dead-end street But I won't heed the battle call It puts my back up, my back up against the wall Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday And this battle's yet begun There's many lost, but tell me who has won? The trenches dug within our hearts And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday How long, how long must we sing this song? How long, how long? Tonight, we can be as one Tonight Tonight, tonight Tonight, tonight Edge, go! How are you? Have you heard of Amnesty International? Well, they've heard of you. And they know. They know all about you. Sing this, for Belfast, for Derry, for Beirut, for Nicaragua. After me, sing: No more! No more! No more! No war! No more! No war! No more! Wipe your tears away Wipe your tears away Wipe your bloodshot eyes Wipe your tears away Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday We're so sick of it! And it's true we are immune When fact is fiction, TV reality And today the millions cry We eat and drink while tomorrow they die The real battle yet begun We'll claim the victory with Jesus' songs Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday Thank you. Thank you very much. Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday ENGLISH
