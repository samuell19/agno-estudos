Dol... Dolsee. - Dolcee. - Dolce. Dolce. Dolce and Gabbana. Yeah. Dolce. Louis Vuitton. Louis Vuitton. Louis Vuitton. Louis Vuitton. Mm. There wasn't a toy I couldn't buy. There wasn't a boat I couldn't buy, there wasn't a plane I couldn't buy. There was nothing I couldn't buy. I love money. Come to me. Eden, what do you wanna do for the beauty pageants? What do you want to win? What's your goal? Money. Money, money, money. I would have money as big as this room. Wham do you wanna do with that money, Eden? Spend it all. And kiss it. I do believe it's un-American to say you can make too much money. I mean, the Federalist Papers say, if I wanna work a hundred hours a week, and never see my family, and die at an early age... that's my prerogative. What were you doing in Dubai? You wanna throw money. You want people to look at you. It's power, money power. Tonight, we're not even worried about tomorrow. Fuck it. It's kinda like the end of Rome. I mean, the pyramids were built at the moment of precipitous Egyptian decline. And that's what always happens. Societies accrue their greatest wealth... at the moment that they face death. I've been a photographer for 25 years. With my lens focused on wealth, and the excesses of our culture. The scale of the excess became clear when I documented the family building the largest house in America. I noticed that no mater how much people had, they still wanted more. I wondered if the hundreds of individual stories I had shot about money, fame, sex, body image, even plastic surgery for dogs, were all connected, and what they said about us. To understand what it all added up to, in 2008, I began working on a book and exhibition about wealth. It would take me back to my earliest work. In 1991, I was just starting out as a photojournalist. I had studied visual anthropology in college, and landed my first assignment with National Geographic, photographing a Maya Indian village in Chiapas, Mexico. My mom was a professor of psychology and had been doing research there 20 years before. So, we worked together on the project. My mother spoke the language and was at home there. But I struggled to understand the culture and found it really hard to be accepted into people's lives. After we had spent months in the field, National Geographic killed the story. I was devastated. I almost quit photography. My boyfriend sew! me a tape to encourage me. Hey, Lauren, Frank here. I just got your letters today. I really, really miss you. Go out and do your photography and be aggressive. The more you put yourself into this kind of work, you're gonna end up confident about looking for jobs and everything else. So, please, work hard, okay? Frank helped me see that I shouldn't give up. And that I needed to find a story where I had a deeper connection to the subject. I happened to find an old copy of Bret Easton Ellie's Less Than Zero. The fictional world he depicted of jaded excess and too much money resonated with what I remembered growing up in L.A. I started thinking about my own culture In almost anthropological terms, and realized I wanted to go home and explore it. L.A. Diary, March 4, 1992. My photography will concentrate on the social rituals of teenage life. I want to photograph Senior Ditch Day, extravagant parties with walkie-talkie-equipped bouncers, girls in designer dresses with hair professionally done, Mercedes and BMWs. One day, I was photographing at my former high school, a private school in Santa Monica. - Here we go. - Testing one, two, three. Oh, sorry. What do you think about growing up in L.A.? These three boys said, "Growing up in L.A. is about money." And they pulled out dollar bills. And it wasn't until I processed the film that I realized they were holding up hundred-dollar bills. And these were 13-year olds. Money just ruins kids. It's ruined a lot of kids I know. On the first day of school, Kate Hudson went, "I'm not gonna tell you who my mom is, she's a big star. And my dad's a bigger star." It affects kids who I know, who you know, how rich you are, what your dad does, what your mom does, what you have, what I have. That narcissism that is so full-blown in the culture now was just beginning to rear its head in that moment in L.A. Photographer Lauren Greenfield has captured the lives of some of Hollywood's children and displayed them in a new book titled Fast Forward: Growing Up in the Shadow of Hollywood. Let's go to the young man celebrating his Bar Mitzvah. Uh, tell us about this. This doesn't look like a religious rite to me. The family who had this party rented out the Whisky A Go-Go nightclub on the Sunset Strip and brought in go-go girls as entertainment for the kids. Looking at all the pictures, I'm left with the real end of the world quality, as though there is a kind of ultra-decadence. These are the images of a society in extraordinary decline. But I'm wondering what you were looking for? I had no idea what I was looking for then. But now, I saw a relationship between what I was covering in the '90s in my first book, and where we found ourselves today. It made me want to figure out why our obsession with wealth and status had grown, and why I felt compelled to document it so relentlessly. So, I decided to go back to the teen subjects from Los Angeles. - Hi! - Hi! Holy shit. Oh, the '90s were crazy. They're inhaling air freshener at nutrition break. Nice. That party that you photographed me in was probably one of the tamest parties I ever had. I mean, the shit I used to do. When I was born was when he really started having some commercial success. which is good for him, bad for a kid trying to be parented. You know, we got raised backstage by a roadie. I could get away with murder because my dad was on the road, my mom was preoccupied, and... how I got attention was by acting out and by getting in trouble. And it really does take a village to raise somebody. And I didn't get that I was more... I was raised on an island with a butler. What do you think it is about L.A. that makes kids grow up fast? It just seems like everyone's in a rush to be an adult. They're losing their innocence so young now. I hope to stay young forever. I don't want to grow old. I think I was maybe 17 when we first met. Um, you came to my school, and you told us you were doing a project. We became friends, and you started following me around. You know, you can look from the outside and think, "Oh, her life is perfect," or, "she's pretty and she's homecoming queen," and this and that, but you know... My family struggled a lot, with, like, financial problems, and these rich Beverly Hills kids can have anything their heart desires, you know? That was one way I didn't fit in. It was kinda like a thing, like, "You're pretty, so you can be our friend." I was homecoming queen, and I had best body. That was what it was called? Best body? Ah, well, it was the senior polls where I had the best physique, I guess. So it was like you dressed with, like, tight clothes, and trying to look sexy in the way that the magazines say, or, like, toward the male gaze. Oh, my god, look at that girl, Scotty. Hop in! Chica! Mija was my girlfriend in 7th or 8th grade in elementary school, - and... - And your hot Latina. Well... With probably one of the best racks in high school. It's not bad. Let's be honest here, Eddie. Hopefully, this is cut. We don't wanna be disrespectful. I'm not being disrespectful. - It's the truth, Eddie. - It is. Growing up here, we thought the entire world revolved around us. I feel like I actually got pretty scarred from that time. And did any of that stay with you? Whatever things happened in high school is always what you're, like, trying to heal from. Later on in life, you know? It really... You're so young and impressionable, that I think those experiences really shape you. When I was in high school, I was really shy and a little insecure. And like most teenagers, I felt like I didn't fit in. I picked up photography to try to make sense of my world. I mean, you went to a, kind of, a fancy high school. Education was important, and it would cost a lot of money to go there. We found a way to pay for it. But the values were not my own values. I think, you, like a normal girl growing up in L.A., suffered a little bit from it. You were trying to fit in from the viewpoint of clothes, nice house, a house you could bring people to. I think Crossroads made you anxious about keeping up with the Joneses. The Brentwood parents were afraid to let their daughters come and visit you in Venice because they thought it was too dangerous. You actually, one time, got out of the car a block away from Crossroads, so your friends wouldn't have to see the cars that I was driving. I, I remember not being able to buy, like, the clothes that everybody else had. Mm-hm. The things you didn't have were the things that I didn't believe in. The fact that I had everything I needed, and still didn't feel like I had enough made me want to figure out why, in my work. - Who is this knocking on my door? - Hey. How you doin'? - You don't go by G-Mo anymore? - You can still call me G-Mo. - Yeah? - Yeah. # Baffin' # # Wanna roll on five rounds... # I came from a good family. I came from a real... You know, my parents worked hard every day. Very middle class, very much so. When I was in the sixth grade, I went to public school. It was just, you know, same old shit. But in the 7th grade, I went to this real expensive school, Crossroads. That's when I got my first good glimpse of a lot of money, and I was like, "That's what I want." Black people aren't really supposed to have stuff in America, but this rap thing is changing everything. # Every time I move The guys downright sparkle # # Picking up my mail Like the fools at Wells Fargo # Hollywood helped me out that day. Made my life like a movie. There's a scene where a girl brought me a platter, with a 40 ounce on it. Everybody wants to have money, everybody wants to be surrounded by beautiful women. Everyone wants to have the mansion. It's like the American Dream kinda stuff. # Baffin' # The dream, it was about you seeing me doing it big. We kinda started laying a blueprint back then. And it's been followed and followed, and now, that's almost standard fare. What G-MO noticed seemed to be a shift in the meaning of the American Dream. It was almost like it had turned into a quest for fame and fortune. And we had left behind the values of hard work, frugality, and discretion that had defined our parents' generation. Was your story an American Dream story? Well, in many respects, it was. Because my dad was an immigrant, and I started to achieve heights that my parents couldn't even imagine. It was a period of upward mobility. And was it the American Dream for your parents that you went to Harvard? It was. My dad would say, "Yeah, my son, Shelly, he goes to Harvard, Harvard, Harvard." He couldn't stop... He couldn't stop saying it. My dad tried to instill ideals in me. And they... And many of them stuck. Like? Well, like, uh, trying to do good in the world. I think it was partly the times, yes. I was still basking in the ethos of the '60s and the '70s. The '80s started to actually change things quite a bit. - Can I come in? - Come in, come in, come in. Yeah. Oh, my god, so opulent. Exactly not my world anymore. The origin of all this fascination with wealth is the US government itself, spending way beyond their means. I'll try to keep this simple, so I don't lose the, the viewer. In '71, America dropped off the gold standard. That basically meant the money in circulation was no longer backed by any assets. The '70s was the turning point. We began to borrow, to maintain both a lifestyle and an empire we could no longer afford. We shifted from an empire of production to an empire of consumption. Abandonment of the gold standard led to abandonment of fiscal discipline. Print it like crazy, make it like crazy. We cut your tax rates by nearly 25%. America, go for it. The values of the Reagan '80s really placed this emphasis on wealth. There was the idea that you were better off driving a BMW and looking super hot. Now, if you look great and you have a nice car, I'm all for it. But at the expense of what? In the '80s, a lot of people I knew were going into banking. And a lot them wanted to be like this fictional character, Gordon Gekko. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. I was definitely Gordon Gekko. My father told me, "Well, the closer you are to the money, the more you will have." The lights went on, and something triggered up there, and said, "Hmm. There must be a way to make so much money that you'd never look back." According to court statements, my wealth was, at its peak, 600 million Euros, roughly 800 million dollars, plus or minus, whatever the exchange rate is. For the sake of full disclosure, how do we know each other? You were not even a senior. And at the very beginning of your filmmaking, I was attending Harvard Business School at the time. Does Harvard Business School teach you how to be a good person? No, we're fine tuned to rule the world. That's it. My dad was always, like, a larger-than-life figure, casting, like, a huge shadow. And I wanted to be just like him when I was a kid. And what drove him? He always, um.. Wanted more, basically, in my opinion, more money, more power, and more, um, fame/infamy. I've been called psychopath, because I could get so detached, just thinking what is the best, highest return. I am also in exile, and on the FBI Most Wanted list. That being as it is, if it had been around 300 years earlier, I would have been a discoverer. But the most exciting thing you could do in our generation was to be a tycoon. You have so much motivation for your work. - What's your driver? - The money. My father worked on Wall Street, so, definitely, it was in my blood. I mean, I'm 39 years old, haven't had a family yet, um, haven't, uh, ever been married. I was working on my career, so I wasn't focused on my personal life. I thought I could never be with anybody who made less money than I did. Now I'm making a lot of money, so, you know, the field has really narrowed, um, substantially. I've tried to build up a real net worth, and I collect contemporary art. I mean, I have like a hundred pieces of art in the collection. That's good. I like that with that stuff. - 'Cause this was a late edition. - Yeah. - Do you like it better? - We thought that was too posey. I think it's a little posey. - You think it's too posey? - It's like Life Magazine. I brought in Trudy Wilner Stack, a longtime collaborator, to help me look through and edit the hundreds of thousands of pictures. Hi. Clean person. But you know what? You have your big assembly tomorrow. No, I don't. - Have you learned everything for it? - Uh-huh. These two are from the bag party. What's a bag party? The day I went to buy the Louis Vuitton handbag, I was the happiest girl in the world. I took the bag, and everyone, "Oh, god, you bought your bag! Oh, yes, it's beautiful!" And everybody bows to the bag. And then I said, "Okay, what next?" I have a combination of many bags. I guess my bag of choice is the classic Birkin. I have them, I think, in almost every color. These are Herm?s bags that women collect. Some owning hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars' worth of bags. And the bags start 20,000, go up. And how do you, a therapist, know so much information about the Birkin bag? Well, I see them every day. It's part of my life. You know, as much as you can dismiss or scoff at people obsessing about their Birkin bags, I think it really does say something about their mental health, uh, something that at its best probably can, and should be addressed. I started off with just a tiny, little skinny chain, and it grew into this. Thirty-three pounds of gold and diamonds given to me by superstars of the world, dead and gone legends. I absolutely love Old World elegance. And you're famous for? I am a two-time Guinness Book World Record holder of the longest limousine in the world, with the swimming pool and a helicopter landing pad, and the Boeing 727 jet limo. When you pull up in the limousine, they don't know who you are, but they think you're someone. The bigger, the longer they are, the more exotic they are, the more the head turns. You gotta fake it till you make it. It just gives off that image that I should be worshipped, almost. You know what I'm saying? I'm somebody, you're not. I can afford this, you can't. That somehow propels them in this culture. Poor people are the ones that spend the most money on the 700-dollar shoes, the ones that don't have it. You want the ones with the bars and the sparkly, the bedazzles on the side, with the shiny when you walk, you know what I mean? Make the girls sweat. You gonna pay about 1,200, 1,300, you know what I mean? It's about exclusivity. Can you call up and get you a pair of the fresh Giuseppes, or do you get to go in the back of the Versace store and shop? The American Dream, to me, it's all about status right now. It's the new, uh, you know, "Dr. " in front of your name. We hold out the illusion of the American Dream. But not only can we, and our children not attain what generations had before, but things are getting worse. When there is no social mobility, the only social mobility you have is fictitious. The presentation that you give to the rest of the world denies your own reality. I've come to look at mass culture, and in particular, television, as a form of violence. Because 24 hours a day, this fictitious lifestyle, which we're all told that we can have, fuels this sense of inadequacy. People used to compare themselves to their neighbors, and they aspired to the neighbor that had a little bit more than they had. This is so beautiful. This is like we're in Italy, honey. What's changed is that, now, people spend more time with the people they see on TV than their actual neighbors. And they want what they have. Like, I probably know the names of the Kardashians better than I, I know the names of my neighbors. If you watch anything long enough, you're gonna kind of think it's real. You're gonna start making decisions based on what you've seen on TV. I do believe in the American Dream. Owning a home is a part of that dream. If one of the goals is to increase home ownership, it makes sense to help people pay that down payment. When we put down the rules, I said, "Well, this rule's not gonna help me make money, right? So, let's tone this rule down." So we set the playing field right for us only. Not for the investor, not for the loan taker, for us. The American economy has retained its momentum... Mr. Greenspan lets open the floodgates and allows everybody to borrow money. If you give money out at no cost to hundreds of millions worldwide, they're gonna do stupid things with it. We never sought out to build the biggest house in America. It's just... It's, like, kind of, happened. When I made the film The Queen of Versailles, with David and Jackie Siegel, who were trying to build a palace inspired by the real Versailles in France, what I saw was the dream that everyone had, but bigger. And they did it the same way everyone else did, which was by borrowing. You think every American wants to feel rich? I think so. Everyone wants to be rich. If they can't be rich, the next best thing is to feel rich. And if they don't want to feel rich, then they're probably dead. It seemed like we were all addicted to consumerism. And with globalization, it kind of spread like a virus. I was working as a sailor. In 2003, the tiny fishing country of Iceland began the most rapid expansion of a banking system in the history of humankind. ...Kardasia? Kardasia? - Kardashians? - Kardashians. Yeah, sorry. Building big to express success and status was not limited to Europe or the United States. In China, I met a businessman who built a full-scale replica of the White House, and the view from his office was Mount Rushmore. This trip in 2000 was my first big foreign assignment, and an opportunity to cover the new wealth in China, but the timing was rough. When Noah was two weeks old, Time Magazine sent me a fax offering me the job. I took it to Frank, crying, and said, "I told you my career would be over when I had a baby." At that time, the women who were successful photographers had chosen not to be mothers. Frank was like, "What are you talking about? You should go." I asked the pediatrician if it would be damaging to a baby to be separated from its mother at ten weeks. And he said, "It'll be fine for the baby, but it's too punishing for the mother." I convinced myself that Noah would be fine. So, I pumped 300 ounces of milk... and went to China for ten days. Being away was hard, but over the next 14 years, I still made 11 more trips to China and Russia, because the stories were so compelling. With histories of revolutions that tried to abolish class and inequality, the desire for luxury and status was even stronger. Thirty years ago, China was an incipient basket case. I mean, it was total isolation, everybody was on bicycle. China's now the biggest market for all the Western luxury brands. What the modern day Chinese woman is looking for today, is a guide. Their mothers grew up during the Cultural Revolution, right? So, nobody could teach them how to wear lingerie. Whenever you carry your hat, or you put your hat on your lap, never show the inside. It's like showing the inside of your clothes. How to eat a banana elegantly with a knife and fork. Some people have criticized me, saying, "Oh, well, you know, why are these people paying 16,000 US dollars to go learn how to cut an orange elegantly?" But everybody who's taken the class has said it's worth every penny spent. In Russia, 20 years ago, they have a small apartment or a small house. They don't have possibilities to have big house like mine. The new Russians, the rich Russians, they build huge libraries, very expensive, with fantastic books. And they're not opening it. And it's not touchable. You cannot even, "May I look at this book?" "No, no, no, it's very expensive." So what? It's a book. In Moscow, the debutante ball of the 19th century has been revived. But instead of aristocrats, the girls coming out are the daughters of oligarchs and celebrities. The ball is sponsored by Maserati and Chanel, and is basically a way to sell luxury brands to Russian women. In thinking about the wealth project, I started seeing connections with work I had done for a book called Girl Culture. For years, I had been looking at how girls learn from a young age that their bodies have currency. Beauty is how you win. When I was single, I dated all kinds of guys. Yeah. I even dated Donald Trump. Donald, we wanted you... And why do we have to suffer to be beautiful? I guess it must be a man's world out there. Women get their legs waxed, their bikinis waxed. They do these cosmetic procedures, they have to put on makeup. Women get the short end of the stick, because we work the same hours and do all the same things, and then have all this other stuff to do. I first met Suzanne for a story I was doing for a magazine about who spends the most on body maintenance. And Suzanne spent the most, by far. I think looking good is important, um, in any business, not just mine. I'm out dealing with clients, selling something, in a sense. People like dealing with attractive people. Ifs human nature. It's very apparent, the weight that's put on having longer hair that's less, like, nappy, and having lighter skin. When I was in 11th grade, like, some people started to make fun of me because I was darker-skinned, and I kind of got down on myself after that. We base beauty off of one thing, and however close you are to that one thing makes you prettier than other people. When you were born, you were in the 50th percentile for height and the 90th percentile for weight, so I knew that, you know, being short and a little bit round was your, uh, genetic body. But it wasn't the body, uh, you know, of the magazines and television, and so you weren't satisfied with it. You know, I think, um, I kept you on the right path in terms of avoiding an eating disorder, which you later studied. When I made my first film, Thin, about women with eating disorders... ...it was really looking at the heart of darkness of mental illness. But a social historian told me, "Psychopathologies come and go. But they always tell us about the historical time period in which they're produced." Eating disorders are really common in the United States, one in seven. And they flourish in countries of affluence, where food is abundant, and where withholding food has power. Shantell had an eating disorder, and she felt modeling was exploitative. So she started cutting herself, and she had really mutilated her body, because she said she "wanted to damage the property." When she referred to her body as property, that really brought home the idea of the commodification of the body. What does beautiful mean to you? # That I get money # - # And I'm gonna be a superstar # - No, not... Forget it. We've probably got a hundred thousand dollars invested in the last four-and-a-half years. You have wardrobe, you have hair, you have makeup, you have coaching. The town that we are from has a population of 566. Just the fact that someone picked her to be on Toddlers and Tiaras was amazing to me. Whoo! Get it, girl! Mom here got to thinking, "What would be the biggest thing that we could do for a 3-year-old?" That's how the showgirl costume came to be. And she won. The connotations that come with the Vegas showgirl never crossed my mind. Apparently, the derriere part would be open, or topless, but, you know, I wanted glamor and feathers and glitz. I always say that maybe if you think there was something inappropriate, then maybe there's something wrong with your thought process, because momma here doesn't see it that way. We're a completely pornified culture. The images of porn are now so pervasive and accessible throughout the society, they've leeched into popular culture. Oh, my god! Are you serious? It's TV, like, the Internet, ads. I know like, a lot of, like, kids and stuff, like, watch, like, porn. And that's also where a lot of it comes from, like, the unrealistic, like, women. I think most people, like, probably including me, were, like, exposed to porn at like... seventh grade, maybe. You're seeing stuff that's just completely fake. Ifs just, like, it's a movie. And, like, there's a camera crew, just like this, everything's scripted. People believe it, 'cause, like, they wanna believe it. And they think that's, like, how real interactions are. Does that affect the kinds of pictures your friends are posting? Yeah. I see, like, a lot of my friends in, like, very revealing bikinis to make sure they get a lot of likes. I did an Instagram study. The photos that didn't receive a lot of likes were stuff like family, and stuff that, like, kids were trying to get away from. Guys want what's really demeaning for women. And to match, like, guys' expectations, I think, like, a lot of women probably try to replicate it. Perfect. I actually do have an interview with that girl, where she says, "We wanna dance like strippers." I wanna be a dancer. Topless dancing showgirl. I think it would be fun, dancing with my tits shown off. If I can accomplish being that, then I can accomplish anything. Booty up, and tip your booty side to side. So, it's almost like a little back stretch. There were even trendy exercise classes that taught cardio striptease. So, we're half an arm from our pole, right hand is up. We step with your inside foot, spin! Yeah, hips shift to the left this time. You can just keep your handcuffs on if you prefer. So let's roll over and crawl and act like we like it. When you're documenting the effects of popular culture, it's almost like the air we breathe. It's everywhere. And so it's hard to actually see it. In my work, I often look at the extremes to understand the mainstream. At Magic City, beautiful girls use their sexual capital to rise to the top. We don't have movie stars in Atlanta, so the strippers are the movie stars. They're high class. When I first started dancing here, it felt like I made it, like I was in Hollywood. It was like you were in the middle of a music video. Shortcut, shortcut, shortcut. Make it overnight, make it overnight. Unfortunately, more and more people are trying to find a way around the hard work that it takes to, um, be successful in life. Being average has never been an option for me. Going to a nine to five would just be... That would be hurtful. It's just the fact that I can throw money on a person. And she likes it! It's a rush. I don't give a fuck, gonna throw this money, like, yeah! Throw it! Ya know what I'm sayin'? It's not finesse. Like, whoa! She might get paper cut. Order up another thousand! Fuck it. Like DJ Esco, I was both critic and participant. Shooting for magazines gave me the front row seat to the popular culture that I needed for my own work. Yeah, lift your leg up. I was banging seven-gram rocks and finishing them, because that's how I roll. I have one speed, I have one gear. Go! It appears Charlie checked himself before he wrecked himself. Writing a 30,000-dollar check for porn star and party animal, Kacey Jordan. Amy said he gave you an unusual tip, like a ball of coke? It was huge. My dream was always to be an actress. It really makes you feel like a movie star when you're in makeup. It was kind of like the film career that I always wanted. When I found out that I could be an adult film star, I was just like, "Let's go," I mean, 'cause when you have nothing else to do in a town you don't want to be in. Got a plane ticket, found an agent... So, that was pretty cool. It was definitely the feeling of being really close to my dream. You know, before I left Oregon, I was living out of my car, so I didn't have to live under my parents' rules. And I was living off Taco Bell, because it was the cheapest thing you could do. I had 88 cents, and the bean burrito was 89 cents. I just broke down crying at the Taco Bell cashier. And then, a year later, I was living across from the Grove, on the top penthouse floor. That was one of the coolest moments of my life, was that, that feeling of, of success. You know, I was, like, buying my sister, and my family, I'm like, "Oh, here is a flat screen," like, "Let's just go to Best Buy and just pick out whatever you want." You know, it's just cash. It was just like from zero to a hundred, and I was addicted. Okay, you guys ready? I was determined to make something out of myself. Leaving Kansas, I said, "Mama, one day, you're gonna see me walk a red carpet." I was a single mother coming to Vegas. I vowed to make that money to be able to give my son something and to always be able to take care of myself where I didn't depend on a man. What I do in Las Vegas is a pretty important business. When it comes to VIPs, everybody wants to feel like a rock star. I gotta make sure that they've got the best tables or cabanas that are around 10,000 dollars, that they have the best bottle service. If you've got the girls, you've got the game. She's not a madam. Just want to clarify that out right now, from her son. I mean, sure, blonde hair, big boobs. Oh, yeah, I know a lot of those, but... you don't compare to Tiffany. Like, she's queen of Vegas, you know? And it's white. - At least I have panties on, this time. - Have some class, don't show ass. Ooh, I like that. Are you out tonight, question mark? Trouble is a-brewing. I've seen a lot. You couldn't show me anything else that would make my head spin. I mean, I've seen everything, from 5,000-dollar contests to see who looks best naked, I've seen... I've done bachelor parties where girls are doing toy shows on a hotel room floor. Toy shows. That means erotic toys? Yes. I'm such an untraditional mom. It's been like a challenge, like, am I gonna bring him out into this nightlife or not? And I, I am bringing him in. I'd love to DJ for as long as I could possibly use my fingers. But I'm also really big into lizards, so... if I ever retired one day, I would just probably own a pet store, probably would make me happy. It's not a moral discussion. Sex is, of course, an extension of commerce. What isn't? We're in the VIP suite of the Artemis Wellness Club. Some would say bordello in Berlin. I used to be co-investor in here. We're matching buyers. Well, technically, you call them Johns in America, and the sellers, which we would prefer to call sex workers, not even prostitutes. Um... I lost my virginity when I was like 15 to a prostitute in Amsterdam, and my dad was the one that actually took me there. My son was driving me absolutely nuts with this girl and that girl, and, like, having bets in school, who will kiss the first girl. And I said, "We're going to Amsterdam, young man." And he's like, "You're almost turning 16. I can't believe you're still a virgin. I lost my virginity when I was 14 to a prostitute that I paid with, with a jar of coins." It's like a rite of initiation. Yeah, I can't let my son pay for it. He paid her, like, a bonus for teaching me how to... how to have sex properly. Unfettered, unregulated capitalism does what it's designed to do, which is commodify everything. Even human beings become commodities that you exploit for profit, until exhaustion or collapse. Did you ever take painkillers or drugs to get through a scene? Uh, yeah, a lot of times. Like, I've actually had my ass torn, um, last year. And I took a lot of painkillers, uh, for that one. Sorry. I did a 58... uh, 58-guy bukkake. Is there more than 50? I doubt it. Is there less than 50 in the jizz? Guys! Quiet! Listen! Fifty-eight loads to the face. So much for makeup and hair. And I am still remembered, like, "Aw, I love that scene you did." And it's, like, I get a lot of clients from just the fact that I did that scene. Chin up a little more. - Nipples out. - Not yet. As much work as I've gotten from it, it was worth it. Good job! But I actually got salmonella. It's, like, a food-borne illness, and I got it. - Yeah. Good job! - Oh! - I wanted to make sure... - Oh, my god! It's probably someone had it, and it went in my eye or something. It was so weird. I wanted to do something cool, or something, you know, for what I could be remembered, but... Yeah, and it worked. Yeah, I always say, uh, Kim's my inspiration for I can still make it, you know? Because I have lots of sex tapes to show, and maybe I'll still come out on top somehow. This is pretty hardcore. Maybe we should, you know, not think about it too much. - And then, um... - Oh, my god. When we started, we thought we were going to go through about... five file cabinets of pictures. And then, we ended up going through... half a million pictures. Almost everything I had done related to this theme and this project. Going through the pictures, I realized wealth was much more than money. It was whatever gave us value, sexuality, branding, even youth. When I was in my 20s, I went to the dermatologist for a routine checkup. And, unsolicited, he offered me Botox. I was so shocked to find out that I had a problem I didn't know existed, that I realized this could be a project. People were not aging like in prior generations. So, I started documenting the value of staying young, and the cost of not being who you are, and yearning to be something different. Cosmetic procedures weren't just for the rich anymore. Most people who got them made less than 50,000 dollars a year. I looked at many cable shows of people who have had plastic surgery. She has worked harder on herself than she ever has before in her life. I ate it up. It's almost like there's a new version of the American Dream. The physical makeover as the rags to riches success story. Cathy was a school bus driver and single mom. I took a raw look at myself. I was no longer married. Um, I didn't have the financial stability that I wanted, didn't own a home, that had been one of my goals for years. I could let that go. What really mattered in life was to be in the best body that I could. The summer of '07 is when all the opportunities seemed to converge. I went to Brazil to get plastic surgery. I had, um... a pregnancy that really had distorted my body. Carrying so large with a nine-pound baby, I had a lot of skin. And how did that make you feel when you looked in the mirror? Awful. And I had contemplated how it affects my daughter. She was an early bloomer, and she was about to enter into an age where her body would change even more rapidly. I had always come to the conclusion that me satisfying my own body issues was the best thing I could do for her. If I said to your kids, 'Where's your mom now?", what would they say? "In Brazil, getting her stomach... her tummy tucked." They're very happy for me. I've also added to the list a breast lift and, um, breast augmentation. I've been convinced that I would look wonderful with a little Brazilian butt lift. And we are sculpting under my neck with lipo, and we are reshaping my nose to refine it, uh, refine the tip, and get rid of a bump. I paid for it on credit. I didn't have all the money at the time. It was son of a miracle unfolding in front of me. Um, but my parents did help me some, which was not a position I wanted to put them in. But my mother, I believe, recognized that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me. Is the plastic surgery here the same as in the United States? It's different. The anesthesiologists, uh, like, um... like to use this technique. I was thinking, it's not like buying a purse, I could take a purse back. What if I make the wrong decision? I'm a little overwhelmed. I'm a little confused. And I'm more alone than I thought. Okay. Okay. Do I know what I'm doing? I know what I'm doing. I'm a good mother, I'm a good person, I might be indulgent. Oh, I can't tell. I'm sleepy. The greatest relief was seeing myself... ...uh, changed, better. When considering one's own body, that's a life skill, a coping skill that every young woman has to develop. My daughter, that was hard for her. It was the changing emotions of emerging on adulthood. She went in her bedroom at the time, and she cut herself. She cut... She carved... She carved letters in her forehead. "Dead." As if she wish she were dead. And that was the hardest thing I've dealt with in my life. The hardest thing. Why would you... intentionally distort, uh, um, deface your body? I felt it was a failure of myself to impart to her how much she's loved, and how much she's worth. I always wanted children. I waited till 40. I thought it was time to get married. We had already seen a fertility specialist who said, "You know, you should start yesterday, not tomorrow." As we sit here today, I'm in the process of doing my fifth IVF cycle. We're not talking about 500, 600, 800 dollars. We're talking about... Five times in, you're, you're at a hundred thousand dollars. You know, our charity dollars this year went towards trying to get pregnant. The process has cut our social life way back. It's not romantic, it's not, "Oh, let's drink a wonderful bottle of wine, and make love, and, you know, here we got pregnant." I had hired the best doctors, I was paying top dollar. If I read somewhere that, you know, exercising wasn't good, I stopped exercising. If I read somewhere that Mayan uterine massage was good, I went and had Mayan uterine massage. I've cut back on the Botox more, because I'm concerned about injecting botulism toxin into my body. You know, maybe that's not such a good idea if I'm trying to get pregnant. Um, so I've kind of done it less. You know, it's funny, after my failed cycle this summer, I hadn't had Botox in like... I went right in to make myself feel better. My time was running out in terms of getting a viable egg. I knew somebody through business who said, "Get my surrogate to do it for you." My doctor, when he first examined Jennifer, said, "You know, this woman is like a walking baby carrier." Like, this is, like, great. When you surrogate, you just have to have a strong mind-set that you're kind of babysitting for nine months. You know, I'm holding on to it, I'm gonna take care of it for you, and then I'm handing it off. Was it expensive to do a surrogate? Very. And what did you need the extra money for? Right now, we have a three bedroom, one bath, which I'm okay with it. It... But, I don't know. Bigger is better, right? Jennifer was great in the sense that it was my thing. She did what I wanted her to do. And so I micromanaged pretty much every aspect of it. She thinks about things like I never thought about. Not standing in front of the microwave, because it would affect me getting pregnant, or don't drink out of Styrofoam cups, no sugar substitutes. Was your husband equally committed to having a baby? Um, you know, the answer is no. The reality is, after the fifth or sixth try, he was no longer that interested. So, it was really a very solo journey for me. It's me, myself, and I, and my worth, which is net worth, nothing else. I had homes of 20,000 square feet I'd never spent a night in, because I was too busy working. Hard to believe if you do the math, but in busy days, 300 to 500 telephone calls a day. I think the first time he retired, he had a lot of money already. I don't know how much. He could have stopped working and led a family life if he had wanted to. We were renting a castle in France, in the boondocks. There was no cell signal. My kids still today laugh, when they say I was climbing on the highest peaks, holding up my telephone to get a signal. That vacation cost me at least three or four million in foregone profit. My dad was always, like, completely disinterested in the family life. We found out he had an affair. I think she was either a stripper or a go-go dancer? How is she different from your wife? Uh... This is hilarious, yes, fake breasts. Very commercially-minded. Well, tell me about this intense, uh... love for excess, whether it's money, women... - Work. - Work. How can a 100-hour workweek not compromise your relationship with anything that's worthwhile? As I went deeper into my subjects' obsessions... I was surprised they reflected my own. We're rolling. Here you go. And I remember when I photographed Shelly, one of the anorexic girls in Thin. She said, "Work is your addiction." Yes. Slop! Why do you think I have a problem? Hmm. You're filming every second of our lives. Do you... Do you think I'm a workaholic? A workaholic? Yeah, like... And your mom is even more than you. And do you think Noah's similar? Yeah, Noah is a little Lauren, definitely. Noah might be more intense than me. One, two, forty-one, three, four, light and quick. Where did the addiction to work come from, do you think? I think it came from you. I think you're a way bigger workaholic than I am. No, you're a way bigger workaholic than I am. How long is the longest you've gone on a shoot? I would say six weeks or two months. I never went away that long. Never! I don't know, I had a lot more time with Dad. - Did Dad kind of compensate? - Yeah. # Nothing's gonna change my world # It made Frank have that very close connection... which has sustained us since that time. It allows me to travel and do the work. - Mommy! - What? Mommy! I just kind of grew up with you not really being around. It sounds kind of bad, but I think the damage is already done. Are you okay? Yeah? Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. At the tone... I haven't gotten to talk to him yet. He called Frank, and... Noah just got a perfect score on his ACT. Hey, Noah, it's Mom. Give me a call, uh, when you're out of class. Okay, bye. Love you. I think he's just happy. He worked hard. It's his achievement, you know? He didn't even call me to tell me. It's just like he's happy. I've always thought that balance was kind of overrated. Shit. Oh, fuck. I'm often chasing my own obsessions with as much adrenaline as my subjects. Even though I wasn't going for tons of money, or the perfect body, I was always looking for more and more. I'm gonna be pretty wide, so you'll have to be behind me. Let's see, let's see how this works. Okay, look at me. Right. You can look up like than, like you were a second ago. Yeah. Look up again like you just were. Beautiful. I don't think I'm meeting my fitness goals. I would love to see this fixed. I would love to see my thighs fixed. My butt needs to be fixed! I saw a similar addiction among women with eating disorders. I would lose five pounds, and it still wasn't good enough. And I'd lose five more, and it still wasn't good enough. The fame, it's such a rush. You know, the instant tweets and instant posts. Wow! Every day, I see some dancers that are addicted to the pole. Um, to the pole money. Success becomes its own perpetual vehicle. You're part of this game where the more, the better again. And a billion is better than a hundred million. I was a hamster... in a diamond-studded gold wheel. You sell your soul to the devil, 'cause you get burnt out so bad, that you just numb it. Where you don't feel the hand on your ass anymore. We detach. And then you put on the game again. If not, it destroys you. There is this place that is too far, and everyone ends up there. When money is success, it's impossible to not want to keep going. Why wouldn't you? 'Cause if a lot is good, more is better. You were trapped in your own ambition. Right now, breaking news here, stocks all around the world are tanking because of... Capital, like any other resource in excess, will cause utter social and economic havoc. When the financial crash of 2008 happened, it felt like a global tsunami of devastation. There were eerily similar scenes in all the places hardest hit. Which I followed. And what about your house? We are in foreclosure. And what's it like as a man, as the breadwinner, to go through this? Degrading. You know, after trying so hard to keep something you love so much... and then they wanna come and take it. I was just... I was just trying to make a home for me and my daughter. That's all I was trying to do. When even David and Jackie Siegel's dream home ended up with a fetid pool and facing foreclosure, for me, it was almost like a symbol of our collective greed and its price. In my path to fairly quick wealth, that made some enemies. You know, I would get a threat or a lawsuit, I said, "Take a ticket, walk to position 134 in the line. Fuck off." There were allegations against me. They basically said I've conspired to defraud. Our CIO, Florian Homm, resigned unexpectedly, in a rather dramatic way. Florian Homm absconded to Colombia. The FCC alleges that he defrauded investors out of about 200 million dollars. I packed up a few things and I found my way to Colombia. Tell me about packing up a few things. You know, the Euro bills are so compact, 500 Euros, it's like almost a 700-dollar bill. And you can literally pack half a million bucks on you. You have these elastic bands which... uh, in your Calvin Klein underwear, that you can stuff them there, and they rarely pat you in your, well, genital area. At the time, I was very attached to money still, literally. Well, after five years on the lam, Florian Homm finally nabbed. He faces four counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, and security fraud. The American justice had me arrested in Italy. I end up in Florence prison, in a cell of 20-square yards, with mentally deranged, violent criminals. I felt horrible. Abandoned. Completely abandoned. I was completely estranged from my children. So if a provider no longer provides, what's his purpose? What's my purpose? As a kid who came from a rock star family who had every advantage, I just kind of, like, "I shouldn't even try." I'm never going to get here. So, why try to get here? 'Cause that's never... That's not good enough. You know what I mean? I'm not a rock star. I'm a bartender. I'm a server, I'm a... whatever job I had to, you know, get by. I had to numb just to be able to deal with the mundane life. I definitely didn't set out to become addicted to, you know, pretty hard opiates, and for, like, two or three months, I started smoking crack. You know, I did any type of painkiller, and those kind of make you feel warm and fuzzy, and I used to say it was like the hug I never got as a kid kind of thing. "Legacy." "Some days I wear legacy like a weight, too big a burden to bear, like something that's just out of reach. Legacy is how I run some days, trying to keep up with my family's achievements. Legacy is my brother getting a perfect ACT score, 36 out of 36. And I remember crying that night, 'cause I didn't know if I would be able to get such a good score, and wondering if my parents would still be proud of me. Some days, legacy haunts me, like an idea that's stuck in your brain, and no matter how much you try and ignore it, it never gets out of your head. Legacy is my life." Very good. That's great. Wow. You wrote that today? Yeah, I did. How did you feel the pressure of legacy? Uh, because both my parents went to Harvard. You're such a weirdo! Dad, do you see this? Why do you feel the pre-- Why do you feel the pressure of legacy? - I'm asking Noah. - Why do you feel the pressure of legacy? I don't want Noah to feel the pressure of legacy. But why have you acted like someone who's had enormous pressure of legacy on you? I had that, too, with my parents. My parents went to Harvard, too. And do you think I was a happy child? Do you think you were a happy child? I don't know, I remember a lot of anxieties and insecurities. Really? What kind? Just, uh, I don't know. I think probably coming from divorce, and... - Mm-hm - You know, maybe your being away, I don't know. But I just always remember being anxious. Mm Mm-hm. Wham do you remember? Okay, let me actually go back. When I had you, I had a PhD. I was a graduate student in culture and human development. The women's movement was just starting. Women are powerful! Join us now! I suddenly realized I was doing all of the childcare. My career was going down the tubes. Your dad was just focusing on his career. We decided to separate. And I knew I wouldn't lose touch with you if I wasn't with you, um, five days a week, and I was just with you on the weekends. Let's just talk about the fact that you got a job in another city from Dad, and we lived with Dad. He wanted to be physically close to you most of the time. And in general, mothers don't need to be close to their children geographically to keep the attachment in the relationship. I understand, years later, that you felt abandoned, but, you know, then that's understandable, because we had been very close. And did you come to visit us every weekend? No, you traveled to Santa Cruz every weekend with Mathew on the plane. Was that unusual at the time for a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old to be traveling alone? I had a very, very tortured relationship with my mother. My mother didn't work. Her priorities were different. We always had tons of help, and people, other than my mother, taking care of us, even though she didn't work. So you want to be different than she was? I think when you go through the journey that I went through to become a mother, like, you embrace every aspect of it. Any time I would tell her anything, she would freak out. So, I started having contractions early in the morning, and I text her, and I'm like, "Don't panic, but..." And, of course, I panicked. She came three-and-a-half months early. I had left the labor and delivery room, went out into the hallway, and was really kind of losing it. And the doctor came out and said, "You've gotta come right now, we're having a baby." You know, I remember looking at him, and saying, "Where did you go to medical school?" And he told me where, and I was like, "That doesn't work for me!" Um, to his credit, he looked at me and said, "Lady, I'm all you got right now." And then around one, two o'clock in the morning, our water burst. It was over, and, you know, they, they grab her. I mean, she was the size of my hand. Um, and they grab her and they put her on a table, and they put them in a plastic bag. And there was a team often people around her, so you can't even see what's going on. And I just remember being... absolutely terrified. 'Cause they prepare you for the worst. I wanted her more than anything in the world. After the Charlie Sheen media blowout, the, the scandal. I was constantly getting followed, like a normal celebrity probably would. I started feeling really bad. Kacey! This is, like, a lifestyle that maybe I would've wanted, but the fame, it did more, like, long-term damage to me than I thought it could. Hey, what's up, baby? Hey, you okay? - I can't do it! - You can do it! - You're doing good so far... - You're doing good! You're doing fine. - You're doing good. - No! "What is she doing? Oh, she tries to kill herself." This is Alprazolam, a.k.a. Xanax. This is Advil PM. Let's watch me die. Goodbye. I wanted to reinvent myself. I needed surgery just to make myself feel better. I started off with my boobs. I did three nose jobs. Another reason for the bigger boobs and the different me was because the fetishes were generally, like, me being underage. It's rare for a grown adult just like me, a woman, to have the body of, like, a 14-year-old. So, that was why it sold so much. I've become this, like, new persona that I've created. Daveney. That was like my way of like, kind of, finally growing up. Speaking of... The morning sickness. Whew, okay, um... I'm actually pregnant now. Uh, it's my 11th time. I think it's a good time, so I'm deciding to go through with it. And I just decided that on Sunday. Yesterday. Yeah. Immediately after Brazil, I was never comfortable financially. I was just thinking, "How do I pick up normal life, keep them in school, and find ways to pay off this debt?" And were you working full-time - as a bus driver that whole time? - Yes, yes. So, why didn't you have enough money if you had a full-time job? Because they don't pay! Money, dollars, dinero, is what it takes. My parents supplemented some of my monthly budget. And after I'd had the surgery... I couldn't have asked them to keep paying for how we live, when I went and got this thing which could seem to be a luxury. And how long did you live in the car? I can't even count how long. You don't tally ii along the way. You will go crazy. My mother had wanted custody. She knew that I couldn't pay my rent in 2008. And I never wanted to surrender my children, but I didn't have enough money to keep them. I know that if I had gotten my crap together with more money... she wouldn't be dead. She wasn't just a self-destructive girl. She was a good child. And sometimes, I think, "Oh, Jaz wants to come visit..." ...for a minute. It's in my CD changer in the car. Sometimes I'll forget or get distracted, and the CD will tum over and I hear the 911 call. Fairfax County 911, where is your emergency? My emergency, uh, my granddaughter, she was drunk. I was taking her home, she... I was probably going about 30 miles an hour, and she jumped out of the back seat She opened the door, she... The same place I birthed her was the same place I saw her die. They had just removed the ventilator, and I could sit with her. I told her I'm sorry. I apologized. I told her I was sorry that I couldn't protect her more. And I had to go on living. I remember a long time ago, my wife and I, we were in the most posh harbor in the Balearic Islands, in the Mediterranean. And there were plenty of boats, 30, 40, 50 million, some of them for sale. And then we sat down for dinner, and I said, "This one, this one, or this one?" That... That woman said... "Turn off your phone. That's all I want. A nice dinner." And it takes a long trip... to come back to what matters. The other stuff... is a delusion. It's a... It's a bullshit game. All of us are following a toxic dream. What you're sold in this world, is a bag of rotten goods. At the end of a decayed culture... we retreat into our own comforting illusions. We build walls to cope with the reality around us. It's not about me, it's about you, believe me. People have a hard time separating reality from entertainment. You know, because there is a line. There's... It's a thick line, it's not a thin one. Corporate capitalism pushes people towards this constant search for the next adrenaline rush. People seek that momentary ecstasy to escape from a darker and darker reality. The population is diverted. Sexual hedonism predominates throughout the society. We are dying in the same way that other empires have died throughout history. - The difference... - Whoo! is that this time, when we go down, the whole planet's gonna go with us. Oh! Dear Lord, thank you for this day. Thank you for everything you've given us. Bless this food and bless this family. - In Jesus' name. Amen. - Amen. When we talked in 1995, you predicted you would be a millionaire. I did. And you know what so funny? When we were gonna do this, I was like "Man, you know what? I told her... I was gonna have 20 million dollars, uh, on-hand cash, and another 100 million dollars in the bank." So, did it happen? Uh, no. Not, not at this moment. I believe that the dream, it's different now. Success is showing my children what a strong father looks like, what a work ethic looks like. He taught me that just 'cause you have money doesn't mean you're, like, all that. A nice watch or a nice car isn't gonna get you to college. It's what you know, not what you have. My daughter, she got a full-ride scholarship to Cornell University. She's a genius. I have the big red Cornell sweater right now. I wear it every day. I wear it around the house. I would love to see all of them go to college. That's the true American Dream. I wanted to come back home to Oregon, so I can make amends with my family, and go through with the pregnancy. But I lost, I lost the child, and... you know, it's really hard to kind of bounce back from that. This whole year, I've definitely felt myself wanting to stop and change, change a career path. I, uh, work at Tan Republic, which is the job that I had at 14. It's very difficult going back to minimum wage from what I've made these past eight, nine years. There was a couple overdoses, and I had over a million dollars in medical bills. I declared bankruptcy just to start over fresh. Now, anything porn or complete nudity, I'm completely retired from that. I really wanted to be me again. I thought maybe Courtney was lost amongst all the previous scandals and my films. And I feel like finally, once again... I can really, really start off with being Courtney again. On any journey, you sometimes have to go back and find your roots, and that's kinda what we've done the last two years. It was time to take a break. We aren't, like, doing that reality TV show. We're just... being normal right now. Eden had been a winner in everything she's ever done, and I feel like the door just went... It was a new scenario, because up until that point, it had been just... You've got this child that is extremely talented. But you're so hungry for it, you're blinded by that proverbial carrot that's dangled out there. You're just a commodity. It's what the American people want to see. They get off work, they want to turn that clicker on, and, you know, "Oh, ooh." You know, whatever. I didn't like who I had become. I didn't like that other people had been able to accomplish ugly things through me in Eden's life. I mean, major mistakes. Would I do it all again? I think I would. I think I would. I really don't even have to think about it, because I wouldn't have had the awakening and the knowledge any other way. I was imprisoned for 15 months without a trial. And they let me go! He's the luckiest man in the world. He avoided getting extradited, and facing a 20 or 25-year criminal sentence. They put me on the list with the likes of Osama bin Laden. It was a global arrest warrant. But I'm completely legally here in Germany, and I cannot be extradited by the Americans. So, I'm living in a very big, beautiful prison called Germany. If you think... that money will buy you anything and everything... you've never, ever, ever had money. Because I can't buy that smile on my daughter's and my son's face, and I can't buy the love in bed of my wife. I can't. You think he learned a lesson from being in jail? I feel like a lot of his regrets are that he kept pushing it to the point where he fell, and he just wishes that he had not fallen. Yeah. That's... I'm still, I'm still not sure how I feel about everything regarding my father. Three days after the birth, I went home, but, um, Suzanne was there for almost two months. She was very tiny, um... She did really well, though. I got the prize. You know, she's here, and she's happy, and healthy, and smiling, and, you know, a terrific little kid. And I... So it doesn't matter anymore how I got here, I'm here. That experience changed me so dramatically. But my ex-husband left six weeks after I brought her home from the hospital. I mean, he's now with somebody 40 years younger than he is. You know, I don't... I don't know how you can be 70 married to a 30-year-old. Nope, that's backwards. You got to put it forwards. Remember? Move the lever. - All right, now try. - Watch out, guys! I think she knows not to touch the art. Uh, wait. Stop! Have your priorities changed? Yeah, there's no question. Okay, off we go. How I spend money. Right? A lot less art, a lot more ballet, or... - piano, or... - High five. Thank you. front row tickets to the Gazillion Bubbles Show. I am not working as hard as I have over the years. You know, I take Sydney Bea to school every day, I pick her up, um.. In fact, the activities I don't take her to is just where there's no value added to me being there. And how are your priorities different than your mother's? I don't know that I can answer that question. I... The last real contact I had with my mother, I was... 22 years old. So even if I knew, I don't think I would know. I mean, what do you know at 22? And did you resolve with her before she passed away? No. - Delicious. - I'm feeding you, Mommy. Do you have any regrets about how you raised your children? About how I raised my children? That's a really hard question. I wish I had known you'd felt abandoned sooner, 'cause I think that we could've talked about it, opened, opened up that conversation, and it would've... uh, it would've improved our relationship earlier, so you didn't have that, sort of, inside you all the time. Thanks, Mom. Um.. Better than doing it at my funeral. Conscious parenting is about realizing how your kids are teachers, they're like mirrors. And a lot of times, they're here to spark things up, you know, within you, that, you know, you need to heal, or you need to work on. I feel protective over her. She's so beautiful, and I don't want her to have to go through, like, what I had to go through. I think about that time and how even I used to dress, and now I'm like, "Oh, my god!" I would never, you know, want Sahiya to go out like that. She doesn't watch TV. We don't have a TV in the house. Cutting that out and just having her reality be what she sees from her mom, or dad, or grandparents, it's been amazing. I didn't get what I needed as a kid, and I'm not mad about it anymore, like, I've done a lot of work to get where I am. It's just the hand that I was dealt, and really, I just want to use that as ammo to be a good parent. Whatever causes good self-esteem it's probably love, it's probably nurturing, it's probably just being there, and letting her know that she's perfect the way she is. You are my favorite girl. Giving her that feeling is my goal. Little boo boo. Hello. Oh, I miss having one like this. Talk to Daddy, talk to Daddy. What do you want? What does he want? So, later on, we can just dump this onto the computer? Oh. Oh, yeah, so, um... Lori, you're going to change the taxi to 4 a.m.? - I did for 4 a.m. - Okay. You know we're leaving at 4 a.m., Frank? - Yeah. - Just for a week. - Bye, sweetheart. - Bye, Mommy. - I love you. - Love you, too. - Have a good trip. - Be good. I will. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, sweetheart. I think your French is getting better than nine. - It was really well-written. - Really? Let me just look at it one more time. Oh, I found a mistake. You have "un cellule" and then you have "une cellule." Okay. All right, well, you probably have a lot of work, I'll let you go. You wanna see Manila? Here, I'll just show you out the window. - Can you see? - Yeah, I can see. It's very blurry. You see the streets a little bit? Yeah, it reminds me of China. Yup. Nice job! Beautiful. Global capitalism has done a very effective job of destroying culture. That inability to hear the voices of the past, to understand traditions, makes it much harder for us to grasp who we are and where we came from. Authentic culture holds up other values, forces us to be self-critical, to look at ourselves. So, this project, like, it goes back for me 25 years. Can you imagine where you'll be in 25 years? Could you imagine where you would be 25 years ago? - No. - Yeah, I don't think I could, either. Except for dreaming of you and Gabriel. So this is our 30-year anniversary. I want to make a toast to Frank, the love of my life, who I can't imagine or remember a life without, and sometimes, don't even know where you end and I begin. For me and the kids, Dad is the secret sauce that makes everything possible, who pushes us relentlessly to make our dreams come true. I'm filming the whole thing. Oh! Keep going. The proud Papa. I'm always surprised by the good things that you do. But it's at an extraordinary price. Effort. You're determined to spend time with family and make sure that happens. But you're all over the place. I realize there's no perfect balance. Nobody has it. But sometimes, I think you are pushing a little bit too hard. For the long run, not for the short run. The work you're doing this time, like, fascinates me more than any other work, 'cause... it's kinda like everything about wealth, like, 25 years of wealth, like the good stuff, like the bad stuff, like the poor people, the rich people, like the happy people, the sad people. Like, I think that's cool. - Yeah. - Thanks, Noah. Ta-da! It's dedicated to you and Noah. You've come a long way. - Just get my hair proper. - Braden, you come here. - Can you hold this with one hand? - Yeah. Okay. Go for it. Okay, hold on. Right, this way or that way? It's kind of ironic that I've chosen to raise my kids in the exact same world that I grew up in. Same neighborhood, same school, same pressures. And even though I can deconstruct the culture in my work, I'm still susceptible to its influence. It's just who I am. It's not like I can really stop. I am in constant motion. And I live with the consequences. But it's also one of the things I love that gives my life meaning. Not much has changed. Rock star, right there. Just passin' a joint around, you know. Oh. Ver... Versace.. Wow. Oh, my god. That's me. Yeah, this is my very first interview I ever did. My very first interview I ever did. Yeah, that was my life back then. Huh. The thoughts of a child, really. Really. Yeah, mm-hm. That's deep. "When I was leaving Kansas City, I told my mom, 'One day, you're going to see me walk a red carpet. I have lived on private jets, Cristal-flowing nights, and I have partied with rock stars, and celebrities, and actors. But you know what they say... "Be careful what you wish for."
