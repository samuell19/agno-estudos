NEET Election: NEET(Not in Education Employment Training) This story is dedicated to all NEETs around the world. Chihiro Inagaki, 30 years old, presentaly a NEET. Never worked a conventional job in his life. He spends his day playing electronic games. Why is Chihiro Inagaki a NEET? Let's look at his history. During his childhood he was very studious. During his elementary, junior and high school days he was a top student. He entered a local National University. Graduating after 4 years, he entered an elite company, but after three months he suddenly quit his job. I do not want to be a cog in a machine. I want to do what I want to do! His idea of the working world conflicted with the reality of the working world. His life as a student went without conflict and he performed perfectly. As a result, his parents constantly praised him. After beginning his job and starting the daily grind, he realized the realitywas too much to bear. Now I decided to be a famous actor! Going to Tokyo and trying his best at being an actor, he couldn't find success. Sadly, by his 30th birthday, finally, he gave up his dream of being an actor and returned to his hometown. I did my best, but I now realized I must work in a conventional setting. By leading the life of a salaryman I can find wealth and eventually a wife and be happy. Yes! You're right, you graduated from a good university and can be a salaryman, get a good salary and have a girl friend. Thank you mama, I now have inspiration and will get my new life. Here you are my little boy, please eat. Thank you mama. Please eat until you can eat no more. I'm going to my best and find a position at a famous local firm. Famous local company interview. You're Chihiro Inagaki? Thank you for applying to our company. I have checked your resume. Throughly, at this time, we would like you begin at our company without much training. Can you meet this expectation of us? 'Company letter' 'We are sorry to inform we are unable to offer you a position in our company. Thank you for time. ' I must set my standard lower and get a position in a lower-level company. 'Lower level company' You are Chihiro Inagaki. Now our company is experiencing the effects of the reccession. Can you understand the position our business is in as a result? I am sorry. I did not do research about your company's present situation, and did not realize the dire straits of your company. ' REJECTION LETTER ' Failure ' Okay, I'm going to get a job anywhere I can. Ramen shop I'm Chihiro Inagaki, I'm here for you. You're a graduate of a famous local university. You want to work at a ramen shop? Yes I love the ramen here. I want to further my love of the ramen here and throughout Japan! I will do my best here. I see you highly motivated to work, yet I don't think you are suitable for my ramen shop. You have failed! Wow! University graduates are applying for work at my ramen shop. The recession is really strong, I guess. I have failed a hundred job interviews. What part of me is lacking? I'm so tired……….. Mr. Inagaki, I have heard your son has come back to Niigata. Yeah... You're lucky, has your son found a job? No,... he is still searching for a job. Your son graduated from a famous university, he can find a good job quickly. ' Hello, Mrs. Inagaki. Hello... I heard your little boy Chihiro has returned home! Yeah... What is he doing now? Well, he is trying to find a job. Your son graduated from a famous university, he can find a good job quickly. Thank you for your kind words. Until meet agin. There are not any good men around here. When I think about it, your older brother was an actor in Tokyo but I heard he has returned. What is he doing now? Now my brother is looking for a job. I'm not certain, though. Well, since he graduated from a good university, he can easily get a job at a good company. Maybe he can be my boyfriend. If he gets a good job, he would make a good boyfriend for you. Hey, Chihiro, how is your job hunting going? How was your job hunting today? Did you get a job, big bother? No, still I have not found a job. I have failed 100 job interviews. So, I'm thinking of giving up completely on searching for a job. No, don't give up, you will only cause me trouble. You have to get any work. My co-workers are constantly asking me about you. Chihiro, my little boy, The neighbors are always asking me about you. I'm so ashamed about this situation. Your classmates work at good companies, get married, have a family. Why can't you do the same for us? Yes, my big brother, my friends are always asking me about you. I can't say my big brother is a NEET to them. Please get any kinds of job. Shut up! Leave me alone. NEET support center Finally, I realize I must ask for help because I can't do this alone. Thank you for filling in the form. I suggest you get practical experience. What? Now, I can introduce to a cleaning position or a farming position. But I graduated from a good university. I want to get a better job. But we can only introduce you to menial labur jobs, or you must go to an employment security office. But I already have tried getting a job at an employment security office. I understand, but you can make friends through our introductions. Okay. I'd like you to clean this floor. I understand. Start here. And help her, please. You too are a trial worker? I, too, am a trial worker. Nice to meet you. Hey, this worker has special needs, but she works very hard. Shit! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I surprise you? Don't worry. Let's work together. I've had enogh! So, I gave up to work. "Buy a light for the bathroom. You can't have dinner tonight if you don't do that. You must holp with homework because you stay at home. What the hell is this. It can't be helped. Wow, So many shops closed down. Thank you very much. Shops around here are very quiet. It used to be so busy around here. Some shops have closed their shatters and gone bankrupt? That's right. Nowedays people buy products on the internet or go to a big mall in the suburbs. This shop has regular work for maintenanc, so we can keep open. But I don't know when we will have to shut down. I see. The bookstore has closed as well. I'm wondering if the candy shop is still open that I used go to as a child. Oh, it's still open! I'm really happy to see it still open. Aren't you Chihiro? Oh, Mrs. Kinue. It's so nice to meet you again. I now knew you are Chihiro. You came here when you were a child. The last time I saw you was when you were a high school student, I think. Yes, that's right, I often came here as a elementary student. Just once I came here when I was a high school boy. This is so nostalgic. This is so nostalgic. You have grown into a fine man. I turned into a grandmother from a middle aged woman. No, you're not a grandmather. Nostalgic! Really? So, what are you doing now, Chihiro? Is today a holiday? Uh........... Honestly, I am not working now. Really? We are in a recession now, but I'm looking for a job. Really, you've had a hard time. In regards to the recession, these shops are slowly closing down. Children don't come here anymore. So, I'm now thinking about closing this shop. Really? But I believe this kind of candy shop is really important for children. Yes, you're right...... When children come to the shop, the shops become busier. You should keep this shop open. You are still young. Yes, I'd like keep this shop going. Yes, Okay, I will make a plan to keep the shop open Okay, I am waiting for your great plan. You can count on me. I'm wondering how should I make people come to the shop. I have experienced at being an actor. Okay, I was a villian in a hero show. I'll make a hero show. It's a good idea. HERO SHOW, Get Together at Park!! """ I can make a costume with a one coin products. Oh, I need a hero and a villian, but I don't have sny friends here. What should I do? I have a good idea... What has come here? I'm looking forward to seeing it. I am the Niigata Hero, "Gata Ranger"!! Eh, eh, eh.., Gata Ranger! This town is mine. What's this? I'll protect this town. My lethal weapon is a Gata Ranger Kick! Ah.......... The characters are opposite. Really? I got it wrong? It can't be helped. Anyways, the first half has finished. When you buy some candy at the candy shop, you can see the second half! Let's go together to the candy shop! What a dummy! What? The second half of the show is even more fun. I'm sorry Mrs. Kinue, the children left the show and went home. I'll make another plan. It'll be even better. This is impossible to by myself. I need people to help me. But I don't have a plan. This is a souvenir from my business trip. Oh, thank you. You are a good child to think of your parents. Yes, you are very thankful. Your company sent you to Hokkaido on business. It must be a good business. We had a lot of free time in Hokkaido. We could see the sculpture of Dr. Clark and the famous clock in Sapporo. You have grown up into a responsible young woman, but your older brother "Chihiro"........ "Next, we will speak of NEET and the problems that come to our society regarding NEET. NEET are people who don't work with no education, up until 35years of age. These people have cut all relations withsociety, have many issues with their family. Finally, some NEET commit crime and we should be aware of this." "These NEET starts suddenly doing anti-social activities. These people have a unique hatred of society. We must be extra-cautions of this special population of NEET." That's the NEET problem. Don't look at me with your scornful looks. NEET starts suddenly doing social-activities. And commit crime. I'm so troubled by my brother. I can't live with a brother who is criminal. Eh........I hope Chihiro will be fine. Don't you think so? I hope so, but.......... I really hope so.......... I need help regarding the shops. Ummm.... Share House? Small income live together in the same house in Niigata. Some of them can be able to start a new project. And you can enjoy the unlimited curry and rice? Haha.... that is interesting. I should give it a look. Yes. Yes, I have heard there is an event of curry and rice. Please, come in. Welcome back my Lord. WilL you have curru and rice? What? Yes, I'll have curry and rice. Wait for a moment. Her name is Yumi. She worked in maid café, but she is nearly 30 years of age and was fired as a result. Never say anything about her age, Keep your lips sealed, please. Okay, let's go into the house. Hey, everyone, we have a guest. These people reside in this house together. I will introduce you to them. This is Riki. He is a musician. He don't speak a lot, but he sings very well. Nice to speak to you. Nice to meet you, too. This is Shiho. She wants to be an idol. I must be a super-idol! Support me, please. This is Mr. "K". He wants to be a wrestler. Hi, nice to meet you. I always wear a Mask to be a real Masked wrestler. This is Shinnosuke. He insists that he is an offspring of a Samurai. He always keep an imitation sword with him. I am Shinnosuke Sannomiya. My father is a salaryman but my ancestor is a Samurai, so I want to be a Samurai and make my own Kendo-jim, too. Nice to meet you. And my name is Kamimura. I'm the manager of the Share House. I'm a professor of a technical college and worked at famous electric company. But I was bullied, and quitted my job. After that I become a manager of this Share House. I hope we can do something productive and useful for society together. Okay....... I understand. Yes. Here is your curry and rice. Oh, curry has come. I'm starved. By the way, what is your name? I'm Chihiro Inagaki. I'm a 30years old NEET. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Oh, you are also a NEET, you seem to be just like us. Ha ha ha... Hey Shinnosuke, you can't eat curry and rice with chopsticks. I'm a Samurai, I don't eat with a spoon. I'm worried about you, Shinnosuke. I don't care about you anymore. Shinnosuke, you are too picky to eat with chopsticks. So, Chihiro, why did you come here today? I also graduated from university and worked at a famous company, but soon quitted and went to Tokyo to become an actor, but I was not successful. I came back to Niigata turned 30 and tried to get another job, but I couldn't succeeed. Now, I too am a NEET. Um....... It is hard to get a job when you are a 30 years old NEET. We can't be full-time employees any longer. Ha ha ha ha......... The reason why I came here today is... Oh, downtow mall..... Yes, I promised a candy shop woman I'll help revitalize the shopping area. But I realized I can't do it alone. Ummmmm..... Okay, I like to sing there. It'll be Shiho's concert. That's a good idea! I would like to sing while playing the guitar. Should I sing, too? I better at using my body rather than singing. What should I do? Ummm......... Oh, How about a "Flash Mob"? Flash Mob? Yes, a flash mob is when people are going about there business in the usual way, then suddenly a mob of people come together and begin dancing. I like the idea of a Flash Mob, it should have a strong impact with many dancers. Please record the Flash Mob Dance routine and then uproad it on to the Internet. I'm sure it will have a great appeal for the downtown area. If the Flash Mob Dance is popular, then I'm pretty sure we can find work. That's a great idea! Yes! Appeal to many people. Let's make this event very uplifting! You got a power! Niigata power! I got a power! Now we fly over the sky. Niigata power! We are strong like the Ibis bird. Flying high and straight in the sky to the world from Niigata. I got a power! My dreams are unlimited. Niigata power! Let’s fly bravely together.

Niigata power! Let’s get walking bravely together. You got a power! Niigata Power!! How is the dance site on the Internet coming along? Not as many hits as we expected. Yesterday we had about a hundred or more hits on the site. Hah! 100,000 hits!?...,. What has happened? Really has this happened? It looks like one famous person has looked at the site and introduced it on this blog. Look at this newspaper! We are in an article. The headline reads "NEET, Freeters try to use a "Flash Mob" to try to increase business in the mall area." Is it really true? We did it! Hey Chihiro, we can succeed if we really try. I can now see this. Let's work even harder and we'll succeed even more. Yes, let's do more. "NEET and Freeters try to use a Flash Mob"" to try to increase" business in the mall area!" What the hell is this? These young people don't have a realistic understand of business. I have a better plan. I'm disgusted by these young people. I can show them I have more power and better idea than they do. I have heard that the leader of the downtown mall area is upset with us. Why? Because we did a Flash Mob and the leader hadn't done anything to help revitalize the area, so the shop owners complained about his being lazy and not helping. It's not our fault. I also think so. Now, the leader of the business mall area is planning to have an Idol Live Concert Idol Live Concert? Wow, we have competition. Hahahaha...... It's sounds interesteing. Let's go and check the Idol Live Concert. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Passion Shiratori! Please take it away! Hello everyone, my number is 53 in the Idol Group, Tokki-Mekki Platoon, named "Passion Shiratori"! How's everyone? ' Passion Shiratori, I like middle aged women....... I'm feeling groovy today. You are my target young man. Do you like middle aged women? You can enjoy my sexy body... Ahaaaa, why are you leaving? What's going on? Why is everyone leaving? Hey, I'm a great singer, you should listen to my singing. I can make you feel good... come back!! I can't believe such a middle-woman would do such a thing. She has caused the business mall are a to lose business. We were successful it helping it. The leader is very inflexible and can not change with the times. Let's try something new again. Do you have any good ideas? Ummmmmm....... I'm thinking that having a temporary event will not have lasting effects on business, so the issue of revitalizing the business area will not be resolved. Let's make our own shop in the business mall area. What? I was thinking about this idea for a long time since we got together here. I'd like to make a business where NEET can work and enjoy life. Oh, that's the key to all our ploblems. When we make our shop I think many customers will come and there will be a ripple effect on other business and we can make a place NEET work and be happy. ' Great idea!! But what about start-up money? We need a lot of money. Actually, the city government can help us by giving us a loan to start our business. But in order to get the loan we need a definite business plan. I hope we can get successful and get a loan. Yes, we can do it!! I can have maid café, really? I've been longing to work there again………..!! Yes, Yumi. You should have a stage at your maid café and I can sing there as a maid café idol. I'd like to sing on the stage there, too. I need a ring and sandbags. I need a Kendo Dojo. Wait a minute. We can't have everything we want, but the idea of having a café is fine and a having the stage is good, because we can hold events on the stage. As a result, people can come together and the business area will improve. We can sell goods there. Mr.K can sell masks, Shinnosuke can sell swords. I think all we can be satisfied with this idea. Okay. I'm happy if I can sell swords. We need to make a place where children can play card games. As a result, they will buy candy at the candy shop. Yes, that would be a perfect shop. Let's begin! Yes!! I will ask an acquaintance of mine who works for a construction company about the estimate of construction costs. I will make a café menu. You can count on me regarding book keeping. My father is an accountant. Okay, let's do our best! Yes! Hey, Chihiro. After we met you everything started moving. You have mysterious power. No, I don't. By the way, what should I do? You should go to the city hall to get information about a loan. I got it. Chihiro! Hey, Aunty! What are you going to do after dancing? I'm really looking forward to the next event. We are planning to start a shop in the mall! See ya, Aunty. See you. Hey, Aunty, what were you talking about with him? Chihiro will start a shop in the mall. Young people will make the mall busier and happier. See you. A young person's shop? Damn, young people. They are going to mess up my plan for the mall. Shit! Hello, this is Oobayashi... I'd like to... Your application says that you have no career, no experience with business. Now you are not employeed. You are a NEET, aren't you? And you want to start a shop at a mall? Yes. Are you kidding? No, not at all. I really want to make the mall area better. My comoany of friends want to work for themselves, so we really would like to open a shop. Hahahaha... There are many NEETs like you who want to start a shop? You're just a joke to me. Reality is harsh in the business world. It isn't a playground. People like you who start a new shop quickly give up. This is a lifestyle for you. People start things and quicly give up. No, not really. In your case, first, you should go to the unemployment office and find a job and work like everyone else, right? ' I'm busy, leave me alone, please. 'Get rid of NEET!' Idiot!! Hahaha…. I saw you at the city hall. You failed the application for a loan? Yes, you saw me? Hahahaha, ….. This process is called Madogiwa Sakusen. This is the tactics of city hall employees refusing new ideas. This tactics is for saving money and time at the city hall. Really? You are a NEET. NEETs are not lazy. They have dreams and will work but they don't have any chance. They need inspiration to change. I think the shop will give them inspiration to change. But we need help from the city government. It's too early for you to give up on your plan. You must make a petition to the city government. There are two ways to make a petition. Have you been to the city assembly, yet? No, I've never been there. At the assembly, citizens can make an appeal with their ideas. You can appeal "we need a law that NEET can start business at shuttered shops." But you need an assemblyman to give you an introduction. Oh, that is one of the ways to make a petition. But i don't think there are any assemblyman you know. Another way to petition is one in which you don't need an assemblyman to make an introduction. This is the better way for me. With this method all you need to do is pass out paper work to the assemblyman. I think no body will be interested in the NEET's ideas. Really? Then there is no way to express our ideas to the city government. There is one other way..... Really? tell me, please!! You should become an assemblyman yourself. What? Me? If you became an assemblyman, you can express your ideas directly at the assembly. If you are over 25 years old, you can be a candidate for office. But you need a large deposit is required to secure that you are a serious candidate for office. I don't think I can be a good candidate. I have few friend who can help me. You should try to get citizens to support you and your ideas. You already represent a small section of society. You should listen to the citizens ideas, collect and take note of their ideas and then present their ideas during the elction process. After doing this process over and over, ypur ideas will naturally become popular among the people, then I think you can win the election. But.............. Your ideas from your group will never become successful if non of you doing try to be an assemblyman. Is this okay with you? Okay, I'll look into this…. Thank you. Please realize that assemblymen are not representative of your group only! They have to represent all citizens. I understand. Mr. Hoshino, Please don't escape from the nursing home. I'd just want to take a walk around the neighborhood. I can see you are interested in local politics because you are the ex-mayer. I was the same age as that young man when I started my political career. I miss those times. Election Information. Yes, I can do this. I'll be a candidate. 300,000yen(2,500 dollars)Deposit requred Okay, I need to get 2,500 dollars. Goodbye my childhood!! Hey, Chihiro. How did the loan application go? Did it go well? Yes, after thinking deeply about this issue, I have decided to become a candidate for assemblyman. Ohhhh….. What? Wait a minute Chihiro. Please give us the details of your decision. I have secured the deposit for the election. Now I need your help. Please help me. Wait a minute Chihiro. What should we do? I don't think Chihiro can get a hundred votes. Honestly, I also think so. Actually, I' ve never voted in an election myself. Hahahaha…. I think it is a good idea to help Chihiro. We can start a shop if he wins, even though it is next to impossible. If Chihiro fails, nobody is hurt. It will be a good experience for everyone. We must do our best to help Chihiro achieve his dream of becoming an assemblyman. Yes, that's right! Chihiro, we have decided to support you. Really? Thank you very much. You need many more people to support you. Your family and shop owners should be supportive. Yes, I'll do my best to get their support. Don't give up! You can do it! What should we talk about tonight? What has happened to you Chihiro? What would you like to talk about older brother? Actually I am going to run as a candidate for assemblyman in the election. I need my family's support. What? Chihiro, lesten to me! Assemblyman should be older and have experience with representation with a group for a long period of time. You can't win this election. I'm certain. Forget this nonsense. Your father is right, Chihiro. I can't go out and show my face because I am ashamed of you, if you fail again. Please, stop this nonsense. NEET have a reputation of commiting crimes after doing nonsensical things. I'm certain you will fail. Please give up this nonsense. I'm dead serious about this. We need a representative of younger people's ideas. I have already decided about this. I will not give it up. Stop this nonsense Chihiro! You will definitely fail because you are a NEET and have no backbone. I'm sure you can't even get ten votes. Don't be such a dreamer and get a real job. Not a chance. Hey, Anunty, I'd like to cosult with you…! The owner of this business mall should support me, shouldn't they? Chihiro, I really want to support you, but the leader of the shops wants to run, too. What? I really want to support you, but the owners of the shops have to support the head. Really? Sorry, Chihiro. You are the young buy who made the Flash Mob. Actually I will be a candidate for the next election. My canpaign promise will be "The Young Power Makes The Business Mall Busy!" …. So, "Fresh Mont Blanc" (Flash Mob)? You should have more events like that, please. Wah hahaha... So, my family will not support me. Ummm…. The head of the business mall will be a candidate for the election. He stole our ideas. That's terrible. We started the flash Mob event for the business Mall! I see that the old business mall people and cabinet members can't understand our ideas for the future. We should make a campaign that Chihiro is the representative of the younger generation. Chihiro, you represent the NEET and Freeter! Young power will change all the citizens way of thinking. Ummm..., Okay, we should make a system which the younger generation can come together and get connected on the internet. Chihiro should collect young people's ideas and present the ideas to the cabinet. Can we really do that? It's simple. I graduated with a technical degree from university. That's great! But you have to act like a candidate. You must make public speeches. You must convince people that you are really serious about yourself and ideas. I will help by using the internet to get our ideas accepted. Public Speaking? I've never done that before. But I will try! Okay, let's do it! Chihiro, don't move! Okay. You must be careful about the way you present yourself. Okay. I'm Chihiro Inagaki. Not that way! Speak up! People can't hear you if you speak softly. You must appeal to the people when giving your speech. Okay. There are certain rules to follow when giving a public speech. The Rules are:? Number 1, I must not say my name too much. Number 2, I must not say that I am a candidate. Okay, Never forget these rules! Okay. Chihiro, I've made your homepage. Already? Yes, already some people have sent their ideas over the internet. For example: Make a list of all black companies or give the workers their proper salary. That's great. Let's make some campaign promises after we gather more ideas from the citizens. Okay. Okay, I will collect the ideas of the citizens with Kamimura. Okay I'll start making public speeches. My name is Chihiro Inagaki. I'm trying to become a representative of the younger generation and then change the way of thinking of this city. My campaign position is I'll solve some problems of the NEET and Freeter and the younger generation disappearing from rural areas. I'd like to make the empty shops into shops which NEET and Freeter can conduct business. Hi, children, which grade are you in? Don't speak to the children. Let's go, children. I have many troubles in life. When I look up to the sky after opening the window. I don't know why tears come to my eyes, even when there's a beautiful moon. Shining in the night. I'm not supposed to be sad. Thank you. Aren't you Chihiro? My friend Riki told me that you are running for public office. I saw you earlier today. Oh, you're Riki's friend? Yes, I started my campaign today, but nobody listened to me. I see …. But Chihiro, I have been singing for two hours here and you are the only person to listen to me. I know in my heart my songs and the message in them will be heard by someone sometime. So, you must not give up on your first day of your campaign, even though no one has listened to you. I see... Okay, I will do my best tomorrow. Thank you very much. My name is Chihiro Inagaki, I'm representative of the younger generation. My campaign position is to solve the problems of NEET and Freeter. And the younger generation disappearing from the rural areas to urban areas. Also, changing the empty shops into shops where NEET and Freeter can conduct business.. Hello, everyone. Why does everyone have such a long face? Hi, Chihiro. You wrote this, didn't you? When a NEET becomes an assemblyman, he or she can get wealthy. The NEET situation has changed dramatically!! What is this? You were sneaky and wrote these words on your blog carelessly. So, your words have gone up in flames. People have written you're only interested in money. You must have written this?! That's not correct. This is your ID. You must have written this. Probably I thought this. There are some assemblymaen who don't work, but get wealthy. So, maybe I wrote it... You're a liar! You just want money. You have used us to become a representative of NEET. No, no... I just want to have a shop with all of you. You have been cheating us all this time? Noooo... I have not... Hey, Chihiro. We don't know your real intentions. The results, however, show that you blog has gone up in frames. We don't care if your reputation goes down. This Geek House reputation will also go down with you. People think Geek House Niigata NEET are connected to Chihiro by money only. This kind of complaint is written on our blog. If we continue to support you, Chihiro, each of us will be forced by the people who support us to stop. We will lose everything we worked for. Hey, Chihiro. We want to stop the relationship we have with you. What? You are the source of all the trouble. Should I physically remove you from here? Why is everyone feeling this way? I see...... We shouldn't have started with politics in the first place with you. I'm all alone again. My friends have forced me out. My campaign has become meeningless…. What should I do with myself from now? Should I go back to the NEET life. But I still want to help the candy shop and the business mall. I really want this city to be better. I won't give up. I will continue with this important purpose. What should I do? You listen to the people and collect their ideas. You must present their ideas to the assembly members. You must do this process over and over to get your purpose to become a reality. You will become popular. Yes, I'm on my way again. A single NEET can connect with the business mall, NEET campaign and hear the citizen's wants and needs. If I continue with making speeches, I can get more ideas from the people. Oh, assemblymen are not only representative of one group of people, but all the people. Yes, that's right. I've seen only a small segment of society in the past. But by becoming an assemblyman, I can't only be a representative of a group of NEET. I must be a representative of all the people. I must run my campaign for all the people. I will visit all sections of the city and take a survey. Notebook Survey Results I'll make a perfect campaign. I'll do my best. Hello! Can I help you? My name is Chihiro Inagaki. I'm now taking a survey. Can I have some of your time, please? What for? For example, what do you want the city government to do for the city? Oh, you will be a candidate for the next election? Yes??? I know about you. There are only elderly men in the assembly. Mister, do you have anything you want the city government to do? I want the young people to change my city. I understand. That's all I want. I'll supoort you. Hang in there. Thank you very much. Young people can change the city to a brighter future. I know you can do it! Thank you. I expect you to do it. Yes. Do your best. I'll count on you! Have you heard recentry a young man is taking a survey for the city government. Yes, I've heard. He is around 30 years old. He wants to be a candidate for assemblyman election. Hahaha… I've heard that a young man wants to be an assemblyman. He is about the same age as my son. I'll support him. Yes, let's support him. Hey, Tomoe, have you heard about the NEET election? What? A NEET is tring to be a candidate for assemblyman. Now he's going to every house in his district and taking a survey. Eh…. The NEET couldn't get a conventional job, but he is trying to become an assemblyman. He is like a "Chameleon". Eh.... I think it's very important to get ideas from the citizens by a survey. I think I will support him, he is a good-looking guy, too. Hey, Tomoe, let's support him. But I don't really know about the political system. I'm sorry. Hahaha..... I've heard an oddball is visiting housesin the district, I think it might be Chihiro? Recentry I 've seen Chihiro going out wearing a suit and necktie riding his bicycle. My friend told me about a NEET election. That's enough! I'm sure, soon people know he's Chihiro. What should we do? I'm so tired. I visited about 100 houses today. There are 25,000 houses in my district. I need about a half a year to complete my survey. Sigh… The election is about a half a year away. Oh, I can complete all the survey just before the election. It will be hard, but I can do it perfectly. I'm now taking a survey, do you have anything the city government to do? I think we need more street lamps in the area. There is not enough in the area. Lamps…. We need a more conducive environment for women to work. Mothers need a more conducive environment to work. I think we need a bicycle lane. A bicycle lane is needed. Hello, I'm taking surveys for the city government. Come in… Thank you for inviting me in. Mam, are you Okay? There's a heater but it's so cold. Of course I would like to use a heater, but I'm broke. I just use this warm-table to keep warm. Mam, are you living alone? My only child passed away and have lived alone since then. I can live because I have a vegetable garden. Really? Is it really true? Have you applied for welfare benefits? I don't want anybody to be concerned about me. I think I'll be just fine. Thank you for coming here and listening to me. Yes..... Kerosene Benefits ticket for elder people. Hello, Mister. Has anything happened? Ah, you were the person taking a survey at Mr. Ichihara's house? Yes, I did. Are you planning to be a candidate for election? Ahhhh…. I'd like to ask you what you think about nuclear power. Nuclear Power? I haven't thought about it. This is a serious problem around Japan. It is imperative that you think about this. I'm sorry. What do you think about the kidnappingof Japanese citizens by the North Koreans? I think the Japanese government should resolve this problem. I'm only thinking about this city. There are kidnapping victims from this city. You should take the victims problem more seriously. I understand. I'll look further into this issue. Are you really serious about solving these modern-day problems? Yes, I can't promise you any results. But I 'll bringing these problems at the city assembly meeting. Really? I asked him first. No, I asked first. Please stop. I'll try to resolve these two problems. Really? Okay, you're the Kidnapping problem assemblyman. No, he's the Nuclear problem assemblyman, right? Ohhhh... He's leaving. You should try hard!! Thare are too many stray cats. I want the city government help by performing surgery on the cats, so they cannot reproduce. Notebook Survey Results Yes, I made my campaign completely. I went to 25,000 houses and completed the surveys. There's one-month to go before the election is held. Candidates Running for Election Meeting. He's a NEET candidate. Is it raelly true he's running for the election by himself? I don't think he can even get 10 votes. I can get financial support from the city for a car and an announcer. I also can get for making one poster and 2,000 envelopes. I'm on my way….. I'm a NEET with no money. I would like to stop waisting tax money which is so prevalent today in the city. I'll do my best to attain this goal. Chihiro must be a true candidate for the people. Should we support him? I don't think we can support him since we kicked him out of this group. I didn't expect Chihiro could become a candidate along with completing his campaign. On the blog, some people are complaining about Chihiro still, but many more people are supporting him. Let's support Chihiro even if we have to do it secretly. A person like Chihiro who is sincere, direct and pure that believes in his purpose. Without question, the best representative of our generation. But how can we support him? How about making a theme song for Chihiro's campaign? We can write and produce a song which will appeal to young people and convince them to vote for Chihiro. We must get the young people to vote. Okay, I'll write a song and sing it in clubs, on the streets, anywhere I can sing it. I will sing, too. As an idol for the election. Afterwards, I will make my debut singing this song. Yumi, we should sing together. Ehhhhhh.... Okay, we should make an idol version, a rock version and versions that appeal to others. Let's make lylics and a melody together. Yes....! Chihiro's name is in the media announcing his candidacy for the election. Yes, Chihiro has caused us much trouble but we cannot give up on him. Let's talk with him. Hello, Chihiro. Can I come in? What do you want? Have you really become a candidate for the election? I think you don't have any supporters. Will you try to run the campaign by yourself? You went to Tokyo to become an actor, but failed. Then you returned home causing us much trouble. Now you want to be in an election. But you are a part of our family and we must support you always. Is there anything I can do to help you with your candidacy? Tomoe, come here and help us. Yes, I'm here for you, Chihiro. We are family. You ask me to do anything. I can put up posters, make post cards, right? There are three people in my family. So you can get at least three votes. Chihiro. I'm certain your father will understand you and you'll also get his vote. Are you making posters? Tomoe, let's help him. Yes, let's. How can I help to make Posters? Please show me. No, that's the opposite way of doing it. Opposite? Sorry, it is my first time. Hahahaha... Mr. Inagaki, your son will become a candidate, I've heard. It seems so. It seems so? Are you against your son's candidacy? Your son's reputation is quite good. He spent much time collecting individual ideas. I think he is a great man, even at such a young age. "One day before the deadline to announce a person's candidacy for the elecion. A new person has announced his candidacy. I am going to take you live to the candidacy meeting announcement." "Ladies and gentlemen. I would like to announce my candidacy for the city election. My name is Tetsuya Ogasawara. You already know my father Taizo Ogasawara who is presently a prefectural assemblyman. I was raised by my father. It is my fate to become a great assemblyman." He will be a strong rival for your son. I received your application for candidacy. Your number for the poster board is 32. Thank you. Can I start my campaign now? Yes, you can. Thank you! Hello, aren't you Chihiro Inagaki? I'm Tetsuya Ogasawara. Yes, I'm Chihiro Inagaki. You must have much trouble running an election campaign by yourself. You can use my staff if you like. No, thank you, I'll do it myself. Oh, really. Tomoe. Do you have some tapes and maps? Are you sure of the places we should put up the posters? Caim down mam. Already the show has started. Let's hurry up! I understand. Just calm down. Hello, Chihiro. Do you have your number for the posterboard for your election posters? Yes, it's number 32. Really, It's the last place on th board. It's fine. I am a challenger. You shouldn't have too much humility. Okay, let's put up some posters. Mmmm...... Where should I go and put posters for you? Dad!! My husband!! Dad!! It's my son's main event in his life. I'll help him of course. What kind of poster did you make? Here's one. What is this? This is a black and white poster. And we cover it with a plastic cover. We can't use much money. Hahahaha..... What the hell..... This poster is dramatically different from other candidates posters. Okay, let's go! Yes sir!! Hi, Chihiro! I decided to support you in this election. What? I don't have to support the business mall leader. He can run his campaign without my support. What can I do for you Chihiro? Thank you, Aunty! Can I count on you to call your friends to vote for me? You can count on me. I have many friends conduct various cultural lessons. I can ask them to ask their students to vote for you. Thank you very much. Do your best!

I think there are twenty-eight positions available on the assembly. That's right. Hahaha.... I've already won a position on the assembly. It was a piece of cake!

This is proof of your election win, Mr. Chihiro inagaki. You have won a position on the Niigata city assembly. I present you this certificate of proof of your win. Heisei 26 (2014) April 25. Niigata City election lead. Mamoru Niizaki. Congratulations!! Proof of Election Win I sincerely apologize to you for being rude to you when we met for the first time. Don't worry about it. Let's make the city better to live together. … Yes…. Finally Chihiro's first day as an assemblyman has come. He must speak about the challenge shop to the assembly for us. Let's go and see for ourselves. Yes, let's… It's the first time for me to come here. I feel like I'm in a professional wrestling ring. Hey, Riki. Buy some popcorn for us. No way, it is not allowed in here. Oh, really? Oh, Chihiro is coming. He looks better than usual. Hang in there! Meeting in Session Let's begin today's schedule with a question and answer session. The first assemblyman with a question is Chihiro Inagaki. Yes, Chairman. I am first. Good morning. Hey, NEET assemblyman. Did you come here today by bicycle like you always do? Hahahaha….. During the election I rode a bicycle, but today I came here by car. After winning the election, did you suddenly become rich? Damn it. What a rude assemblyman. They want to interfere with Chihiro's start. ...I'd like to start with a question. Hey, your hands are shaking. It is better to go home. Hahahaha.... They are many rude assemblyman here. Why doesn't the Chairman scold them for their rudeness? ...The first question I would like to ask is about the challenge shop. The NEET shop will go into bankruptcy quickly. I'm sure the NEET will quickly give up. Hahahaha..... Mr. Chairman, ther're too many interuptions during this session. Please do your job and control this meeting. The mayer has spoken. Please be quiet and listen to Mr. Inagaki's speech. As I was saying, I'd like to ask a question about a challenge shop for NEET. You know I was a NEET. I couldn't hold down a job for very long. I stayed in my room for a long time. I wanted to be released from my situation, I applied for work at the emplyment security office but I was only introduced to menial labor jobs. I was not satisfied in such menial labor. I couldn't find the road to full-time employment. I quited my menial labor work. I lost my way, I realized that I wasn't the only one with such troubles. I saw many people with the same trouble as me at the Share House(half-way house). All of us NEET had a discussion about a challenge shop for NEET in a empty shop in the business mall. I'm sure it'll be great for the NEET and the business mall. The NEET can challenge themselves on the pursuit of their dreams. We can choose when we work, we can discover happiness though. The challenge shop work after which we can live independently. That is what NEET really desire. This is a much better way to support NEET by the use of city taxes. The merit of the business mall will improve. Currently the business mall is economically depressed. The owners are ageing. Young people do not want to continue running a business which their parents have held on shutter street. Young people can revitalize the business mall with challenge shops. People say Neet can't conduct business for a long period of time. They don't have motivation to work hard. But in reality NEET really want to work. What is the central question for the assembly is, how we can support the start of business for NEET!? What do you think of the challenge shop for NEET? Also, what do you think about making the business mall economically viable by the younger generation. I'd like to know your opinion, Mr. Mayer. I would like to know an answer from someone in a position of authority. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I will answer the question from Mr. Chihiro Inagaki about the NEET challenge shop. First of all Mr. Inagaki, congratulations on your successful campaign and win. I was very interested in the 30 year old candidate's position. You won the election which means to me you represent the younger people's ideas. It is my responsibility to consider all the citizen's ideas. Regarding the challenge shop, there're many younger people who cannot find suitable employment through the employment security office. The city government should support the younger generation. As mayer I investigated this problem deeply. Through my investigation I found that the business mall owners have expressed their want of the younger generation to establish challenge shops in the empty business mall shops. Mr. Oobayashi the leader of the business mall gave me an official request in writing about this. Mr. Oobayashi....... I have officially decided to support the NEET by the establishment of the challenge shops. We must qualify this support with a time limit. Also, NEET must take advice from a financial advisor appointed by the city. We'll revise the budget in order to support the NEET and the establishment of challenge shops. What does this all mean? What are you stupid? Chihiro has been successful in his fight. Chihiro was successful in getting the city government to change. Really, can we have our own shop? We did it!! Welcome Back My Master! Wow! This is what everyone worked so hard for. Welcome back my master. Oh, Chihiro! Yumi! Come on in! Hey, Chihiro. Long time no see. You look like an assemblyman. I'm planning to serve this dish of lion omelette rice. Oh, that is a good idea. Oh, thank you. Please make yourself at home. Alright. Yeah! The Shiho Concert will now begin! Thank you for coming today. I'll make all of you happy. Let's begin with the first song! Thank you... Oh, it's you! ...This is a much better job than cleaning, isn't it? We three people are the Dream Rangers or the miracle from the Konan Area! Wow. Please shake our hands! I passed the exam for the Niigata Professional Wrestling Federation! I'll train you very hard! Yes! Are you ready for hard training? Yes, I'll do my best! Yeah!! Let's begin training! Yes…! 1, 2, 3……! Finally I got some students. Thank you very much! Everything was perfect with your concert. Thank you! Mmmm…! I feel like I'm on top of the world. I can give you the fountain of youth! Chihiro! Everyone seems to be happy after all your hard work. Yes…. I'll do my best always. As an assemblyman, I cannot only work for young people, but must work for all the people: NEET, Business mall, Education, Welfarerecipants, Agricultural people... Everything! I know it is very important to be a civil servant, but you should also think about yourself. If you can't find your life partner, I can't find my life-partner. Yes, I'll do my best to take care of myself. Yes, that's right! "These events are based on true stories. If you come across a person like Chihiro, a young man or young woman who doesn't seem reliable but tries to make your city better. Please do your best to support him or her." The End
