Okay, well, this is me. Okay. Okay, bye! Thanks. No, I think you're gonna love it, actually. Mm. Here we are. Oh, hey roomie. How'd it go? Ugh, another dating nightmare. Oh. More blog fodder though. Ooh, and he definitely lied about his height on his profile. Wait, unless he was using the metric system. Well, at least you're getting fresh new material for Luckless, right? True. Here you go. Cheers. Cheers. Okay. Mm! That is disgusting. Okay. Uh, yeah, cheers... to a great first date. Or not. Who's that? That's my son. Hey! Ty. You're home early. Yeah, our coach let us out early. Ah. Mm... Do we have any extra Thai food? So what's your name? Brittany. Oh, Brittany. Brittany, Brittany, Brittany. Be serious. But he's a single dad. He's what, at least eight years older than you, like... Do you really wanna be dealing with me all the time? I'm going through puberty as we speak. And I'm a nightmare, he knows it. You really wanna waste your twenties trying to be my step-mom? Ha! Okay, yeah. There's a reasonable explanation why I didn't... And you don't really have to go but... She's gone. She seemed nice. Yeah. Actress? Dancer, actually. Shocking. Shocking. Yeah, lots of shocks tonight. Um, hey, you. You know that nice, fancy expensive cell phone I go you? Well, you can use that to like, call or text me, tell me you're coming early, maybe, and then we just... we'd have less shocks. Mm. You know what? I was thinking that, but I was like, "He's probably busy, I don't want to interrupt." I was busy? Yeah. Who knew? Not you. 'Cause you didn't call me. What's up with you? Come on, out with it. Can I, uh... Can I have some money? There's a school dance, tickets go on sale today, so... Are you finally gonna ask that girl out? Uh, yeah. I think so. Hm. There you are. Thanks. Hey. You got this. Yeah. I'll see ya later. Yeah. Okay, so while you were off on your date with Napoleon, Inga had me taste test not one, not two, but five raw only restaurants this weekend. I never want to see an uncooked carrot in my life, okay? Oh, oh. Hey, uh, you dropped this. Oh. Thank you, that would have been bad. School dance tickets go on sale today, so... Oh. Well, good luck. I hope whoever you're asking says yes. Yeah. Me too. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Aw, sweet kid. My blog barely has any readers and my mother... my mother is now officially calling me her spinster daughter. Spinster. Like I'm, I don't know, some kind of Victorian recluse. Okay. I actually kind of like that. It's like you're a poisonous spider trying to trap a man in a web, right? Or, I'm a writer with a failing dating blog. You know what? Your post about the gym guy was really fun. Oh. And he spent three hours extolling the merits of calf implants. Oh, yeah. You know what? At least we can revel in how beautiful the city is in the spring time. Mm-hmm. Well, I would rather revel in that. You are shameless. Turn around. I'm not... And we're late. And you've got some drool like, right there. Ladies! All staff meeting in the sanctuary, please. Now! Here we go. Another round of pre-summer weight loss plans and obscenely priced travel guides. It's like the swimsuit season prep brings out the um... demon inside of her. You know what, maybe this year she'll want something new. You know, maybe fiction? Yeah. Or maybe pigs will fly. Okay. Okay! Kyra, I'm going to need some recipes for vegan baked goods for lifestyle. And please do not send me anything else with dates in them, you know I abhor dates. They make my thighs bloat. Right. I hate it when that happens. Um, can I just ask you one question, Inga? Uh, can I use... sugar this time? Kyra, is it 1985?! N-No, it's not. Okay. Moving on! Jen. Hi. I'm gonna need you to, uh, take over advice. "Spring Fling: Single Ladies." We're really ramping up our spring dating issue and I want you to spearhead it. Uh, Inga. Sorry, I just like, kind of thought that, you know, I was gonna tackle that... No. Winnie, I'll give you something more manageable. Facial oils. Facial oils? The oil that you put on your face. Right. Yeah. Hydrates. I love facial... oils, Inga. Perfect! Write a piece on it. Yeah. Enter! Oh. Hi, Inga. Hello, Winnie. I was hoping to talk to you about my column. You're just not relatable, dear. I mean, everything you write is just so... boring. Okay... There's nothing personal or interesting about your work. You may as well be an algorithm at this point. Well, I actually, uh, have a blog on the side where I write about dating anonymously. It's called Luckless. And? Well, I mean, I think that's relatable. You know, maybe that's... that's what our readers need, Inga, to read about women who don't have it all figured out, who don't have all the answers to dating... Oh, Winnie. Winnie, Winnie, let me stop you right there, because you have to remember that our readers come to us for aspirational content, yes, not to hear about your sad little dates. And sorry, was I not perfectly clear that I expect my writers to focus entirely on their Mush content? Yeah, I know, but I... No buts. Now you have a piece to write on facial oils. Off you go! I hear that's fabulous, by the way. Peppermint under-eye, revitalize... Morning! Dirk Perkins! Don't you ever knock? I can sign this guy, Ret. Every sports agent in the city wants to sign Dirk Perkins. From what I hear, he's a petulant little zit. Hey! He might be a little zit, but he's gonna make us a lot of money. If you're gonna take over my company, you gotta do more than sign Dirk. Dirk Perkins is gonna be the greatest baseball player since Mickey Mantle. We gotta sign him. That overconfident little punk will never be as great as Mickey. You got that? If you wanna sign him, go sign him. Just quit bugging me. You're gonna thank me one day. Uh, Ret. Mm-hmm. Are those the tickets to the Insiders Gala? They sure are. Perfect, because I think that would be the greatest place to butter up Dirk. You know, a little glitz, a little glam, hob nob with the creme de la creme of the city, bada bing, bada boom, wheeling and dealing. Uh, about that... There's something we need to discuss. Shoot. You hungry? I think it might be good for you to sit out the Insiders Gala this year. Hilarious. Nice one, Ret. I'm serious. What? Sit it out? As in, I'm not invited? But... Ret, I represent the agency, we always go. How can I put this? You ruin the gala. Every year. Without fail. No, the... last year that famous singer guy and I danced for like two hours. You danced for two minutes and then you left with that Victoria's Secret model who wasn't even your date. So? She was that famous singer guy's girlfriend. What's the problem? When are you gonna stop acting like a kid, huh? Don't you want a real relationship? For Ty. Something serious. You must be tired of all this running around, and I'm sure Ty is too. Listen, Ty and I are doing fine on our own and I don't want to go to the gala to flirt with women. Dirk Perkins is the biggest prospect. Ret, if you... if you're worried about me taking over, you don't have to, because I know the company inside and out, but I've got to be at the gala to cash in on Dirk. Not this year, Holden. Come on, what do I gotta do to prove to you I can handle this? What? What are you scheming? I have a proposition. Okay. The gala is in exactly one month. Why not find a girl and try dating seriously? You're predicating my attendance on my ability to find a girlfriend? Mm-hmm. Okay. Piece of cake. No, I wanna see you actually take a girl seriously. Maybe even fall in love if you're lucky. Look, if you want to take over my company, I gotta see real commitment. Bring her to dinner the night before the gala and I'll decide then if you've formed a real connection. Do that, then you can come. No, Ret, there's got to be another option. Just... go for someone you wouldn't usually go for. You can do it. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Are you okay? Ugh! Inga is killing me with this face oil article, I mean, peppermint does not belong anywhere near your eyes. Oh, it feels like I just maced myself. Ugh! Here, try this. Oh, thank you. Mm. Ugh... Tastes like rocks. Okay, well, you try inventing a calorie-free pastry, okay? Yeah, well, at least she's letting you keep your column. I mean, she said my writing isn't personal. Forget Inga. Mush is just a job. You should focus on your own projects. Ooh, like your blog. Oh my gosh! Hey! You should write something for Mush on Luckless. Like what? Okay. So you think your dating life is a disaster and yes, it is. But it's actually pretty entertaining. Ooh, maybe you just need to find the perfect Mush guy. Yeah, you know, that's not a bad idea. Right? Yeah, I can find a guy who I know girls like me have dated before, someone who Inga finds aspirational. Yes. But I mean, what kind of a guy has every girl dated? A commitment-phobic man-child. Yup. Yeah. Oh. Oh, wow. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. I'm going to throw those out. That's disgusting. Let's go find this guy. Yes! Yes! I mean... We're the two musketeers, right? We don't need some lady coming in here and messing up our guy's things, we are the kings of our own castle. Where are you going with this? So, I know you're not thrilled about some of the women I've dated but Ret is insisting that I give looking for a serious girlfriend a try. I mean, it's really important 'cause I gotta sign this prospect, and I've got to do it at a gala... So, okay, so Ret wants you to have a girlfriend so that you can go to the gala and sign that Dirk guy? Yeah. I say do it. You know, just find someone that Ret will like and then, after that, we can go back to normal. Two musketeers, right? And you're okay with this? Yeah, whatever. Sometimes I swear you're a 40-year-old man stuck in a teenager's body. Gross. Alright, you want to, uh, help me pick one? Uh, duh. Alright. Well, she's got to be the serious type. Oh, what about her? Uh, yeah, so, how about I handle this, you handle homework? That's lame. Well, here goes nothing. Okay. Let's see here. Here we go! Him? Okay. Nice moustache. But you know what? Too artsy. He looks like he would spend all night quoting Kafka. Oh. What about him? Oh. Wait a minute, isn't that the hot guy from the coffee shop? Do it right now before I do. Come on. Okay. He messaged me. He wants to meet. Wow, he moves fast. Operation let's make Luckless Mush approved... ah-begins! Okay. Here we go! Wish me luck! Good luck! I'm going on a date! Yes! That guy is so hot. Uh, hi. Winnie? That's funny, I think I saw you the other day. Uh, yes. You must be Holden. Hi. Hi. Uh, this is the place. They do great live music. I think it's jazz tonight, not my preferred genre, but... Perfect, I love jazz, I actually used to sing in a jazz club in college. Oh, God, really? No, not me. Terrified of singing. Oh, anyone can be taught to sing. Like teaching a dog how to walk on its hind legs. Shall we? Jinx. So, what kind of things do you write? Well, I actually work for a women's lifestyle brand, Mush, right now. But I'd like to write fiction novels some day. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Um, I'm an agent. Sports agent. Represent a few all-stars. Alex Halsey on speed dial, no big deal. Hm. The pitcher. Mm-hmm. Oh, hey... Christie? Brittany! Brittany! Brittany, right. Uh, Winnie, this is Brittany. Brittany, Winnie. Hi. I really wished you would have just told me about... You know, Brittany, we are actually on a date, so this is not the right time... Oh, no, no, no. Don't mind me. This is great. Uh, Brit... what did he not tell you about exactly? She's not important... It's not important. Um... It was one date, so let's not make this a bigger thing than it actually is. That's gin and tonic. So, what did you not tell her about exactly? Um, we went on... we went on one... one date, it's really not important. Okay. Well, I have what I need. Ugh. I mean, what's the big deal? We went on one date! I haven't even seen her since! Oh, and her fury just totally came out of left field? What did you mislead her about? Women don't go around just dousing men in overpriced cocktails for not reason. Well, apparently in my experience, sometimes they do. Okay, so, you just go out with women, hide something big from them, and then never talk to them again? Yeah, I've dated around. So what? You are a walking cliché. Yeah, women like you are exhausting. Oh, I'm exhausting?! Yeah! I'm sorry, I wasn't the one who just had an ex-lover pour a drink on me! An ex-lover?! Yeah! Hiya. Oh, there's another one. Yeah, why don't you two have a great night? Fine! Fine! Go, you giant-eyed, stuck-up jazz lady! Fine you, you... you lothario! Ha! Oh, an old-timey insult that I'm not even really sure I understand! How will I ever recover? Good night! Um, I'm guessing it went pretty much how we expected it would? He's Satan, Kyra. Satan. That's why he's so hot. Oh, you have no idea. Well, happy writing Miss Luckless. How's that for personal? Hey. Hey. You okay? You look tired, are you hungry? Do you need a snack? No, and that's just a polite way to say I look horrible. Okay... Don't freak out. Okay? Okay. Inga would like to speak to you in her office alone right now. Why? Why, why, why? I don't know. She just insisted that I send you in to see her when you got in. Maybe she just wants to talk to you about your fiction work. You think? Really? No. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to make you feel better and I'm really stressed out. Ah! Oh... Yeah. Okay. Pierre, can you stop sneaking up on me like that? I will be right there. Okay. Don't worry. Okay. Kyra. What if she saw my blog? Oh, what if she saw my blog? Mm-mm. There's no way that she saw the blog. Nobody reads the blog except me and weird Greg in 5-C. Ouch. Sorry. And Crazy Carl in 6-S. Oh, thank you. Nice guy! Yeah. Yeah. Ah! Why are you screaming? Sorry, just, your hand looked, um... You wanted to see me? It's for cell regeneration... Obviously. And yes. I want to speak to you about this. This is your blog, is it not? The one you were trying to pitch me the other day? I can explain. She's viral! My best friend! This blog is biting. Witty. On trend. Very unlike you. I was actually trying to take your advice, you know, be more personal in my writing, and I thought the blog was a great exercise. And I know, technically, you know, it's not allowed, but... It's brave and controversial. I love it. You what? I love it. So I'm not fired? No! No, no, no. No, see, I want to take this little anonymous blog of yours and turn it into a regular column on Mush. I want you to keep writing content like this. Inga, really? Oh, yes! Oh, I have so many ideas. I mean, there's so many things that I wanna write about... No, no, no, dear. I'm sorry. You're not... You're not understanding. See, dating in the city, it's a jungle, okay? Women are struggling every day to find real, lasting love. We should embrace all your many, many flaws. That's what our site needs. Your date was cathartic. It was a beautiful revenge story set against every guy in the city like The Player. A triumph from break-up column! Uh, yeah, I'm actually not following. You keep dating this player character. Put him in more uncomfortable situations. Write about it for the site and I will consider letting you have your own column to write whatever you want. Okay, so, so... you want me to keep seeing Hol... The Player, and to write about how much of a disaster he is, and then I get to write whatever I want? Exactly. And I'm doubling your pay. And promoting you from staff writer to regular columnist. Congratulations. Uh, I mean, Inga, this is an incredible opportunity, really, it is, I just don't think it is possible. I mean, I can't even guarantee that he'll agree to see me. I mean, he hates me, like, really, really hates me. Well, if you want a column and creative control at Mush, make him un-hate you. Okay. But I have one condition. I'm listening. As long as you want me to write about my personal life, I get to keep my anonymity. And I also get to protect his identity. Being anonymous just helps me be more honest in my writing. Surprisingly chic. Deal. Alright, so this column will run 'till the end of the month and then, you can pitch me whatever you want. Inga, why the end of the month? Because then we'll be switching over to juice cleanses and colonics. Winnie, come on, keep up. Oh, juice cleanses, yeah, I can't wait! Thank you. What happened? Uh, well, she gave me my own column. What? Are you kidding? That's amazing! Right? Why do you look so disappointed? I... I'll tell you later, I just, I gotta go have lunch with my mother. Oh, joy. Yeah, I'll... Say hi to Evette for me! Oh, yeah. Love you, spinster daughter! You're slouching, dear! I don't understand why you're always slouching. When are you gonna just take your trust fund already? This job is grinding you to a fine powder. I want to make my own money, okay? I have an apartment that I pay for, I'm a writer. You know, we've been over this. You are a gossip columnist. It's hardly a real writer. Well, it's not gossip, it's actually a lifestyle brand, it's a huge company, Mom. I just don't understand why you insist on this bohemian starving artist bit. I mean, this family has worked hard to give you the means to live a comfortable life. And you're throwing it all away to write... What? I don't know, what are you writing now? Well, I actually just got my own column. Ah. Yeah. About dating. Oh, how gauche. Nice cut, Dirk. I swear, it was like every woman at the place was a vulture, and I was a piece of fresh roadkill. But that Winnie stole my mojo. Ooh! That was a mean curveball. It was a bit outside. It's alright Dirk, keep it up! Come on, Jaybird, you're weak today. Speak of the literal devil. Give it another shot. Why not? Why would I go on another date with a woman who made it very clear she thinks I'm a walking cliché of an unsettled man-child? To her credit, she's not wrong. Yeah, she is. Right, really selling me on this second date, Ret. You're so used to having women fall all over themselves for you. Maybe it's time that you spent some time with a woman that doesn't find your overconfidence, your London accent, and your annoying good hairline so charming. Call me at six. This guy's got an arm. Okay. One more date. For Perkins. I can't believe he agreed to another date. Yeah, it's like he was actually eager to see me. But luckily, you know, I had a little bit of time to plan something. Ooh! Yeah, you know, just something to speed along the material, make Inga happy. Mm, well that's the only thing that's important, making Inga happy. Mm-hmm! Have fun! Thank you. See you later. Alright, I am off, second date with serious girl. I ordered you pizza. Cool. You know, if I keep this up, I might actually get a serious girlfriend. Whoa, Ty, come on mate. I'm joking. That's not funny. So what's going on with that girl you like? Did you ask her to the dance yet? Uh... not exactly. Come on. You gotta put yourself out there. Well, that's easy for you to say. Okay Ty, listen. Women are easy. Just tell her that you like her. Dad, no offence, but I just don't think it's a good idea for me to be taking advice from a guy who got a drink thrown at him less than 24 hours ago and is now going on a second date with a girl he doesn't even like because his boss told him to. Harsh but fair. Pizza will be here in 20. Cash is on the counter. I'll be back in a bit. Cool. Later. Hi. Hi. I, uh, wanted to apologize. I think we got off on the wrong foot. It's okay, I shouldn't have called you a lothario. Truce? Truce. So, what exactly are we doing? I've got something in mind. Like? Jazz night again. I thought we already did this? Well, kind of. Here he is. Hey! You ready? Uh, what's going on? Hello, hello! Ladies and gentlemen, ah, do we have a treat for you tonight. Welcome to the stage, the one, the only, Holden Fulls. Woo! You want me to sing in public? Yeah. Have you ever heard two cats fighting in an alleyway? That's me singing! Relax! It will be fun! I... I don't do music. Well, you do now. Okay, have fun. Okay... Woo! Holden, everyone! Uh, I... I... What song? What song? It had to be you. You can just do a scat improv. You'll be great. Uh, great. Okay. I don't know any... I don't know any... It had to be you... It had to be you... Skee-ba-ba-boo. Skeedle-bae! Haba! Haba! Haba! Skee-da-da-dee-ah! Skee-sko-badoo... Skee-skada-bow! Love! Yeah! It had to be you! Skee... Yeah, cheers. Woo! Well, that was deeply scarring. And not just for you. Well, cheers to being traumatized and never singing jazz again. Oh, I can't cheers to that. Cheers to me never singing jazz again. Are there any other activities that I should be aware of? Well, uh... I actually volunteer at the community centre by my place. Plan after-school activities, and I mentor kids and stuff like that. So, you like kids? I love kids. Yeah. Good to know. Hey, um... why was that woman so mad at you the other night? I suppose she thinks I, uh, mislead her. About what? A part of my life. What part? You know, if we're gonna keep doing this, I think it should happen organically. You know, some things take a bit of time. Okay. Fair enough. Well, this is me, so... Do you...? Shall we? Good night. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Good night. Handshake. At this rate, I'll never get to the gala. Tell me, how did I end up with a trashy dating column when all I've ever wanted was to be Harper Lee! Winnie. Just do this one job and then you can write anything you want. Yeah, I just don't know if I can keep dating this guy because he's awful, Kyra! He's awful. So you use it. Channel it. I will use it. Use it. I will channel it. Yes! And then write about it. Yeah. Okay. That's it. I can do this. What would you do without me? Okay. Here goes nothing. If you need me I'll be right here, okay? Okay. Okay. The post has 500,000 views. Yes bestie! That is what I'm talking about. High-five. Yes! Oh, that's so good! Hey. Mm-hmm. Do you think I should tell Inga that I put... regular flour in those brownies? Stop! Mm! Absolutely not. Yes, yes, yes, Kyra! Yes to this! Mm. I need to know that I'm gonna get the best sneaker contracts, sodas, watches, billboards. Your number one priority is playing ball. You're talented. But you're an inch away from screwing it all up with that mouth of yours. What Ret means to say is that if you do your job out on the field, I can make sure all the big brands are gonna be begging to work with you. Eric Potsworth says he can get the job done, so, how do I know you'll do it better? Hold off on making a decision until after the Insiders Gala. All the top CEOs are gonna be there, and they're always in the mood to do business. I mean, Eric Potsworth's a dime a dozen and his agency's a veritable meat grinder. You need an agency that actually cares about you. I guarantee I can secure you a big brand contract at the gala, right then and there. Hm. Deal. I'll decide at the gala. Ah, Jada, um, hey, there's this, uh, there's this dance. Jada. What's up? It's... Ty. Hey, ladies. Hey, Jada, um, don't look now, but I think that boy might have a crush on you. And interest in asking him to join us today? Hey! Over here! Yes, you. Come here. I run the after-school activities here and we're actually playing basketball today, any interest in joining us? Uh, yeah. Sure. Oh, great. I'm Winnie. Ty. You know, Ty, when you like someone, it's probably a good idea to talk to them. What? I... I don't like... Tell that to your face. Look, Jada's like, next level. There's no chance she likes me back. Mm, I wouldn't be so sure. Really? All I'm gonna say is that she's actually mentioned a boy named Ty before, so unless there's tons of Tys running around your school, I'm guessing she meant you. Just ask her. How? Be honest. Put yourself out there. You got this. Ask her. Thanks, Winnie. I mean, what was that about Ret? He's a chump, Holden. Now, I've been in this business for over 40 years, and I think I know a thing or two about what players are gonna last. Who said anything about lasting? When I started this company, you know what I wanted? A billion-dollar valuation? No. I wanted hall-of-famers. Players that gave everything for the game. Some players are just money players, Ret. You came to me knowing zilch about baseball. All that cricket and polo and whatever else you Brits like. You were hungry. And you wanted more. Remember what I said to you? "You don't have to swing hard to hit a home run. If you've got the timing, it'll go." That's right. Yogi Berra. Yogi Berra. Why don't you dig down deep for me and find that kid again? 'Cause that money-grabbin', fast-talking fool ain't my thing. And it sure isn't the way I want my company run after I'm gone. Well, you'll see. After the gala. Hey. Quit swinging so hard, kid. Hey! How are you? Arts and crafts. Yup. Starting to think you enjoy torturing me. Painting is relaxing. Really? Oh, yeah. Paint brush. Right. Cheers. Oh. Okay. Easy. Sorry. It looks like you're enjoying it. Don't... don't break the artist streak here. Kind of therapeutic, no? I'm so Zen. Yeah, me too. I'm like a koi pond. I'm like a cloud doing yoga. You know, you're kind of killing my Zen right now. Okay. Okay. Who is that supposed to be? It's me. Kind of. Okay, well, from this angle, it actually kind of looks like a very colourful Winston Churchill. Oh, bollocks. That's it. I'm done. I've had enough. You really do a lot for this place, don't you? These kids are important? Oh yeah. Yeah. This year I'm actually giving them all art supplies. Oh, how many? There is 218 this year, something like that. You're gonna give 218 kids art supplies? Well, sort of. Oh, what, you're a trust fund baby? Well, I don't use it, so I put it back into the community centre. Are you telling me you've got a trust fund? Look, I don't need all that money, and I would rather have it go to them. You know, this place actually reminds me of my childhood. Oh, you used to volunteer too? Uh, no, more like I was the one being volunteered for. There was this woman, a lot like you, actually, who used to drop off gifts at the leisure centre. The only gifts I ever got. Oh, I... I didn't realize. Well, most women as beautiful as you are not as giving. I should probably, um... I should go. Yeah. Okay. Hey! You almost knocked over the former prime minister! Poor Winston. How are you? Ignore this. You're home late. Yeah, I actually had a... a nice time. Cool. So, do you, uh, do you actually like this girl or...? Yeah, I kind of do. Well, am I gonna get to meet her or... at least get to know anything about her? Well, um, when I'm ready, yeah. Can you at least just tell me what she's like? She's um... generous and kind. And surprising. Look, I wanna make sure that if and when you meet her that she's gonna be someone that's gonna be around for a long time. Yeah, I get it. It's just, you know, two musketeers. Right. Always. You know you're the best, right? You know that? So, uh, what's your next date? Well, I think it's gonna be an urban scavenger hunt. Apparently there's all these cool things hidden all over the city and I've got this site that leads us to all the cool spots. Sounds fun. Yeah. I'm gonna get some sleep. Good night. Good night. Scavenger hunt. Here. Oh, yeah. Cheers. Thanks, mate. Have fun! Hey. Hi. Uh, eat some candy or something? Uh, no. No, why do you ask? Mm... Why? No reason. Okay. You're being weird. Glad the red dye was washable. Yeah. Me too. Says we're supposed to go to Harold Washington Library but... this can't be right. Getting directions to previous destination, Hair Restore Hair Plug Doctors. Uh... Okay, so, I don't know what that's about. Would you like me to direct you to Toupees and Beyond, Doctor Coiffure, Balding Specialists? No! I mean obviously, I've got a full head of hair. Yeah, it's a really believable toupee. It's not a toupee! Mm. Yeah. No, it's real. Touch it. Directing to Big Ricks Wig World. Gah! It must be some sort of bug. Well, apparently our urban scavenger hunt has turned into a slow walking tour of the city. Yeah, but at least I'm learning a lot about hair-restoration technique, so there's that. Oh, are you? Okay. Okay, well, follow me. This way. Now, if you see... this house right here, when I was younger, my friends and I used to doorbell ditch houses just like that. I dare you to do it again. Okay. Only if you do it with me. What? No. No, no, no. Oh, oh, no, but are you a chicken? No! No, I just... Are you a chicken? She's a chicken. Okay. Okay. Go! What are you... Oh, my, she's coming! My heart's gonna beat out of my chest. I forgot how fun that was. Sierra. It's Inga. We should talk. A 100-mile-per-hour fastball. That's impressive. You ever think about playing pro? Take my card. I think you've got something special. You know, one thing I'll never understand about you Americans is how much you love standing in line. There's actually a ramen place in Wicker Park that has the best ramen ever, obviously, and people actually camp outside the night before. Camp? Mm-hmm. We should go there next time. Literally the night before. It's that good. Can I ask you something? Shoot. How are you still single? Honestly? Well, my dates are usually disasters. Oh good, I thought it was me that was the disaster. Oh, you are. Trust me. But so am I. Uh, you've got a little... Oh. - Sorry, uh... - Don't answer it. Sorry, I, uh... one sec. I gotta go. I spaced on a deadline. I thought you wanted to be a novelist. I mean, your boss sounds awful. And she's clearly addicted to her phone. Just... Why not just quit? It's not that simple. Okay? I gotta go. But... Okay, Winnie, I didn't... Great. What am I doing? Hey, hey, hey! I made lasagna. You want some? No, I'm good. You okay? We almost kissed. You and Player? Ew. Why? What? When? Where? How? It's like I'm actually starting to actually like him. How am I supposed to write a break-up post at the end of this thing when... If I'm actually starting to have feelings for the guy? You need to tell Holden the truth. What? No. I can't. He'll hate me. It's going to come out eventually, Win. Women all over the city are reading your column. I know... it's bad! Ugh, it's bad! Are you crazy? This is what you've always wanted. Your writing is finally getting noticed! Stop "Holden" back the truth. See what I did there? - Yeah. - Tell him. If he really likes you, he'll understand. Something to ruin the mood. - Toast? - Thanks. I'm going to stay at Brody's after practice if that's cool. Uh, sure, yeah. That's fine by me. Sweet. Okay. - Have fun. - I will. See ya! Sorry, Ty. In case she comes over. Hey. Hi. So, you've shown me your world. How about today, I show you mine? Okay, what did you have in mind? Oh, look at you. So cute in your little helmet. What did I do to deserve this? Hey. I sang and did art for you. Two of my least favourite things. Indulge me in a little payback. Fine. I'm just gonna widen this out. Now, this is kind of obligatory. Okay. Now... Baseball is all about grace. Yeah! A little more grace than that. Grace and... Okay... Efficiency. Never... take your eye off the ball. - Okay. - You ready? Not at all. Ugh! Oh, I'm terrible at this! You're closing your eyes! Remember what I said, always keep your eye on what you want. Whoa! Woo! There it goes, we got a ringer, ladies and gentlemen! Miss Winnie Rhodes! You gotta run, you gotta run! I gotta run! Come on! They're signalling! She's running home! She's going for it! Don't slide! - I don't even need to rush. - Safe! Amazing. - So, why baseball? - Why baseball? - Mm-hmm! - Why baseball? Of all sports, why baseball? Baseball is the most American sport there is. Um... Um... Okay, when I left England, I left with nothing. I had no money, no family. America was this fresh start. And apple pie and baseball were my first American loves. And they are dear to me to this day. Sorry. Ugh, you're so lucky, you know? To have a career where... you get to do what you love. Why don't you just write on your own? I mean, what is stopping you? - It's not that simple. - I think it is, because... Mm-mm. You have this trust fund, right? You could just go off and write. Be free. - No, I... - You've got this incredible safety net that not a lot of people have. Why not use it? I don't want to look back and wonder if I made it because I'm actually talented or because I'm just privileged. You know? Hmm... And here I thought all rich people loved being rich, but you... are an enigma, Winnie Rhodes. - Enigma. - A complicated, selfless... giant-eyed, beautiful... wonderful enigma. Oh! Oh, uh... - Oh, that's, that is... - It's okay. Really not how I wanted that to go. - It's totally okay! Um... - Um... - Do you have some soda water? - So... yeah. Soda water. I've got soda... So how about, actually, why don't you just, um... Why don't you just throw this on, and I'll pop that in the wash? - Awesome, thank you. - Right. Uh... It's okay. Do you happen to be a fan of old movies? Love them! Yes! Oh, this is my favourite part. Humphrey Bogart is an absolute legend. Ew! Ty... Winnie? What are you... I think I got the stain out. Oh wow, Ty. Mate, you're early. Um... Dad, this whole time, you've been seeing Winnie? How do you know even know? He's been coming to the community centre. And were you ever going to tell me you had a son? - Of course, listen... - And whose is that? Uh... I genuinely have no clue. Right. Forget it. I gotta go. No, Winnie, I can explain! Well, I can't explain the mysterious nightie, but I can explain Ty! God, you're an idiot. Enter! Oh, Winnie! - Hi. - Just the girl I wanted to see. I was hoping I could talk to you about my column. Yes! It's a smash. Now, I'm thinking we turn it into a book. - Uh... - I mean, I've already been in touch with the best publisher in the nation. They love the idea. A... A book? What? Yes! Yes, we'll take your existing posts and then you can expand upon them. Maybe add in some dating tips, things like that. It'll be an easy read. Right. W... Why would people want to buy a book of posts they've already read? For the extra content! I published a book of tweets last year. Trust me, audiences crave books like this. Right, uh... There's just something that I... I was in touch with the papers! The Times wants to do a feature on Y-O-U! Huh, wait, what? What about our deal to keep my anonymity? Well, sweetie, anonymity works fine for a blog, but for a book, we... we really need to know the author. Do you know what I mean? Like, it's part of the package! The big reveal! He has a son. Okay? He happens to be the father of one of the kids I mentor, and I just, I can't do it, Inga, okay? It's... It's different now. Excuse me? I can't keep writing about him. Um... I'm done. Do you think just because he's procreated that that will elicit my sympathy? No... This book will launch your writing career, Winnie. Right, and I am so grateful for that. Really, I am. But Inga... But what?! What?! You... Oh, you have feelings for him? Oh, you want me to play mommy! Give you a little huggy wuggy? Is that it? Huh? Get over it, Winnie! I don't pay you to feel. Okay, I just think that if you give me a week to date other people, I can write about somebody else. I promise you. I can write just as good about other people. Fine! If it will get you over this schoolgirl infatuation. But I expect you to start turning in content for the book ASAP. Whatever you need, Inga! Don't touch my desk, Winnie. We're done. Yes, yes! Are you mad at me? No, mate. I'm not mad. I'm sorry about... about the nightgown. And the GPS, and... dyeing your mouth red. I, uh... It was all me. I mean, if I had known it was Winnie that you were dating, then... Moral of the story is I... I shouldn't have been messing with your dates. I'm sorry. Thanks. You know, I figured it was you. I think I'm just nervous... about you actually liking someone. You know? It's just been you and me for so long, and... Hey, you know I was actually scared to introduce you? You can be quite the harsh critic, Ty. Yeah, I know. But I don't think you should give up. She's... She's actually really cool. She helped me ask Jada out. She's a really nice lady. I'll try not to be so critical anymore. Thanks, Ty. Yeah. This is garbage. Oh, hey, Mom. Hi, Winnie! I was just reading your column. You are Luckless, yes? Uh, yes, why? Who's asking? Some of those jokes are a little crude, darling. And I noticed that you're relying very heavily on slang. Okay, Mom, since when do you read Mush? Well, I was curious! The women at beauty salon couldn't stop talking about it. And that boy, the Player, he sounds like a good fit. Yeah, I'm actually not seeing him anymore. Did your posture just change? You sound like you're slouching, honey. Okay, well, um... Mom, I, I... I really actually have to get back to work, so I gotta go. Oh, okay. Well, hang on to that young boy. You know how your mummy loves a British accent. Okay, Mom. Bye. What? And here we are. This is where our associates are, we have a boardroom back there, but this is the guy. Ret, this is Jason Byrd. Guy's got a great arm. I liked him. Good kid. That's the kind of player we need more of around here. You know, humble, hard-working, in it for the love of the game and not because he wants all the latest sneakers. Well, he's a diamond in the rough. But we still need those big wins like Dirk, Ret. Not that I've got any chance of signing him now. Why? Is something going on with that girl? Uh, she's just ignoring me. I guess you can count me out of the gala. Maybe she's just busy with work. No, no. I just dropped the ball and didn't tell her about Ty. I mean, I wanted to do it the right way and introduce them but... He walked in on one of our dates and now she's ghosting me. Ghosting? Hold on, she died? No, Ret, you old boot. Ghosting is when someone you're dating stops responding to you. Ah... I totally understand why so many women hated me for ghosting them. It's really insensitive. Have you tried a grand gesture? Like a good romantic comedy? You show up unexpectedly with a boom box over your head. If you want to come to the party, you know my terms. - A grand gesture? - Think big. Now let's move on to the Luckless column. Winnie! Winnie. The numbers are tanking dear, it's time to bring back the Player. Well I, uh... Okay, okay! I'm sensing you're about to give me a whole energy here of excuses, and I'm gonna need you to change that around to a whole energy of solutions. Yeah, Winnie. Help me help you. Help me help you. Mm-hmm! Help me help you! Pierre, like you mean it! Yeah, okay. - They're so happy. - Mmm. Uh, okay! First of all, I was really invested in that movie. Second of all, how long is this pity party gonna go on for? You need a plan, Winnie. Okay, well, I'll make up some posts and I'll pretend that the real Player is back. And Inga, she won't know the difference. Winnie Rhodes! Did you hear that? Or have I had too much wine? Hey! What's he doing here? Is that Player? What's he doing?! Winnie! I'm not sure, just, uh... Winnie Rhodes! Wha... What are you doing here?! - I gotta to talk to you! - Holden! Okay, I'm gonna start singing. No! No, no, no, Holden! And all of your neighbours are gonna hate you for it! No, no! Holden, Holden, don't! This is for Winnie Rhodes, everyone! For Winnie Rhodes! No! Holden, no! It had to be you! Okay, are there two cats fighting in the alleyway, or is that his singing voice? That's his singing voice! Skeetley-da! How have you still not learned the lyrics?! Dee-dah! It had to be... you! Holden, no! Okay, fine! Fine, fine, fine! Fine! I'll talk to you. Just... I'll talk to you! Please just stop singing. I'll just, I'll come down, okay? Okay. God... I'm an idiot. Where have you been, Win? I, uh... When I found out about Ty, I... - I know what's going on. - You do? You got scared. I'm scared too, Win. Well, it's not that. I mean, it is sort of that, but um... Holden, my job... You can write whatever you want. Job or no job. You're brilliant. - You're being too kind. - No. I'm being honest. I mean, if this job is that important to you, I'll support it. I just want you to be happy. But Ty really likes you. Now what? You could quit ghosting me. That's absolute torture, that. Tomorrow, my boss is having a dinner and Ty's gonna be there, and I want everyone to meet the right way. Will you come? I'd love to. - And keep Saturday open. - For what? You'll see. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Do you know how hard it was to find a boom-box? Yeah, I bet! - Tomorrow! - Tomorrow. I... Okay. Hello? Your numbers are through the roof. The fans are buzzing about Player's return. Too sentimental for my own tastes, but the metrics are great. Okay! Yeah, that's good. And how are the last chapters of the book coming along? Well, um, I... I almost finished it, but actually, uh, I wanted to talk you about the break-up post, um... We can discuss that later. I've moved the Times shoot up to today. Wait, what?! We are rushing the book launch to next week. Inga! We need to ride this momentu! You know, we've only got one more column, and then we're hitting the shelves. So meet me at the office in three hours. And please, Winnie, detangle your hair before you arrive, for everyone's sake. No, no, no, no, no! Ugh! - It's fine... - Dad, chill! You're making me... - Hi! Hi, hi! - Hey! Sorry, I'm late. It's good to see you. Hey! Wow, you look beautiful. So, are you done ghosting my dad now? I mean, I thought he was gonna have an aneurysm there for a few days. Really? No, he's just a teenager. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Yeah, I do! He was stalking your social media nonstop. - Oh! - Total creep status. Ty! Shall we? You're grounded. - Oh, hi. Good to see you. - Young man... Ret. This is Winnie. - Hi. - It's so nice to meet you. You too. I've heard only great things. - Oh, really? - Oh yeah, yeah. Holden always talks about how lucky he is to have a boss like you. - Well... - I like her. She knows that compliments are a way to my heart. Well, in that case, uh, you have a great smile. Off to a great start. Okay! So I programmed his GPS to only direct him to a hair plug doctor, and Toupees and Beyond. I mean, how did you even do that? Um, I'm good with technology. My generation was practically born with tablets glued to our hands. If he's balding, you can tell me. - Oh, hi! Talking about me? - Don't worry about it! Some other bald guy. Oh! Inside joke. Oh... I like her. You can tell if he's balding. Go on. I mean, he could be. - Really? - You're in. Well, thanks for coming. You were a real hit. One more thing. Come with me tomorrow to the Insiders Gala. - Are you serious? - As my girlfriend. Just kiss already! I'll, uh... I'll figure it out. Okay. Let's find a way. I'm gonna see you tomorrow? Thanks for the advice! Romantic! Absolutely not. If you pull out of this book deal, I will sick every single attorney in the city on you and I will eat you alive. Got it? You signed on to do a break-up column and a tell-all book. Well, I want a break-up! Got it? - Yeah. I understand. - Good! I expect to see your post tonight. Don't disappoint me. - Wow. - Too much? No, No, you're perfect. Here we are. I have to say that... it's been a long time since I've enjoyed spending time with someone this much. Yeah, me too. Uh... Holden, there's just something I've been, um... I've been meaning to tell you. Yeah, you can tell me anything. Uh... Well, the, uh, the column I'm writing right now, it's very personal. Okay. What I'm trying to say is that, um... Tomorrow, there's a big release, and well, I'm supposed to... - Hey! Hey, there he is! - Hey! Wicked. Would you excuse me? I just need to... go to the restroom. Holden! Please tell me you have some deals for me. Uh, you see that... You see that guy right there? The CEO of the biggest sports department store on the planet. Just happens to be my golfing buddy. - We expected... - Oh! Hi, Ret! Oh, there you are, Winnie. How are you? It's good to see you. I'm doing a lot better now that my top agent has his head out of his rear end. And you to thank for that. Oh no, no, I can't take credit for that. Oh, yes, you can. - Would you excuse me? - Yeah! - I just, I need to, um... - Sure, absolutely. Hmm. So, when do you think I'd get paid? Well, um, that depends... Well, hello there! I'm Dirk. Are you texting your boyfriend? Actually, I'm reading Luckless. Luckless? No way, I love that column! Player is a hot mess. Wait, what are we talking about? Oh, it's the most popular dating column ever. This girl is dating this guy who's a player, and he's a disaster. Okay. And they went on a date, and a woman he used to see... Poured a drink on him! Remember the doorbell ditching? No, no, no, the jazz date! It had to be you! Awful, awful, awful! I've made my decision. I'm letting Holden take over. He's convinced me that he's got what it takes. I thought for sure he was faking it with Winnie just to get into the parties so he could sign Dirk, but now... I can't believe he showed up to a date with red teeth! Oh, yo, Holden. You said that your date works at Mush, right? Maybe she knows who Luckless is. Excuse me. Winnie. Holden, don't. All this time you were writing about me, huh? Using me, that's your big secret. Yeah, and you were using me to get to some baseball player, right? I was your ticket in here so you could get some big endorsement deal? Is that it? Well, you would know about putting work in front of everything! Hmm? Wouldn't you? Making a fool of me in front of millions of people! Millions! Making fun of my singing voice?! I didn't even want to sing that night! Whoa, wait, Holden, you're... And you used me so that you could chase your next big paycheque, because guess what? This was never about you opening up so that Ty could have some... some stability! No! This was always about money, because that's all you care about. You honestly think I would introduce you to my son if I wasn't serious about you? Hmm, how would I know, huh? You seem like you're pretty good at hiding who you really are. Well, that makes two of us. Doesn't it, Luckless? Yep! You're right! I'm Luckless! I hope everybody enjoyed the show. Oh, and one more thing. Holden here, he is the player! - Yeah! - The one and only! You know what? I'm gonna do what I should have done on that very first date. Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry! Just for the record, that was supposed to hit him, not you. I'm really sorry! That was hilarious! - Hey! - Hey. How'd it go? What happened? Winnie! Did you tell him? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I told him. Okay, it's gonna be okay. Come on. Sit down. Come on. Don't cry, you're gonna make me cry, okay? You know what always makes me feel better? Eating a snack. Come on, you want one? - Okay. - Yeah? - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. It's gonna be okay. Okay? Sorry for ruining yet another one of your events. You're not the only one to fumble the ball today. I shouldn't have let it slip about our arrangement. Would've been nice. No, mate, I'm just not made for commitment. Just because it didn't work out with Winnie, doesn't mean that it wasn't worthwhile. You let yourself fall, it's a good thing. Well, at least I got Dirk. He's got his shoe deal now. Mm-hmm, sure does. Big book release day! Want to get some celebratory brunch? No thanks. I think I'm just gonna stay here. I'm really sorry that I pressured you to write about your personal life. No, no, no. No. You know, you and Inga were right, okay? I was too afraid to put myself out there that I was hiding behind this persona. Okay, maybe I needed this. You know what? I'm gonna make us some brownies. With actual butter. Actual butter. - And sugar. - And sugar. - And joy. - And joy! Mm-hmm! - Thank you. - Of course. Inga, hi! Your last column was fab! And I got you a spot on Wake Up America! Get ready to be a bestselling author! Oh, uh... What did she say? Uh... I'm gonna be on Wake Up America! You're gonna be on Wake Up America?! I'm gonna be on Wake Up America! Oh my gosh! High-five, bestie! Yes! That was... 500K? They're lowballing me. You're still a rookie, Dirk. You know I'm worth triple. It's one shoe deal. There's gonna be plenty more where that came from, trust me. No, no, it's about respect! They're not showing me the respect I deserve. Respect? Respect?! You want respect? Earn it on the field. How many homers have you hit? How many double plays have you made? Zero. You're not even on that diamond yet. I'm gonna be the greatest player in the game. Everyone says it! Will you? That's funny, because right now, all I see is an overconfident little prat who only cares about endorsements. You want to be great? Shut up and play baseball. We're done. I'm going with Eric's agency. Fantastic! Enjoy that. Bye, you little zit! Whatever, old man. You were right. He's nothing but a little punk with no work ethic. What are you even doing here? Go home and be with Ty. He's got a girlfriend now, too busy for his dad. How's that for irony? Hmm! - Uh, I need a distraction. - From Winnie. "Love is the most important thing in the world. But baseball is pretty good too." Yogi Berra always has the answers. Mm-hmm. Sure does. So, Mr. CEO, tell me more about this pitcher, Jason Byrd. Gotta sign him. Already got him, Ret. That's my boy. Ah! There you are. You're late! I'm 10 minutes early. Huh. Well, it always feels like you're late. Whoa! No, no, people! People! Was I not clear, here! No processed foods! Inga, this is just like... it's a lot... - I know. - It's a lot more than I bargained for. Like, I just... Right, right, right. I get it. I get it. I mean, you're the t-shirt girl. The girl who knows what a fourth down is. But what sells is glamour. So play the character. - Play the character? - Exactly. You're Luckless, the girl with the most captivating dating drama on the planet. And soon, you'll be a bestselling author. Uh, Inga... Since you said if the book was a hit, I can write anything I want... Anything within reason, yes. Yeah, well, I want to write fiction. I've started on... Absolutely not. Never. So what am I allowed to write? You can write anything you want. Uh... Dating faux pas. Whether to get botox or filler... Or both! Inga, this wasn't our deal. Well, Winnie, you wanted to be a bestselling author. I made that happen. And I expect you to act accordingly. Don't let me down, Winnie. Do not put that next to the veggies! Welcome the author of the bestselling Luckless Guide to Love... Uh, Dad? Winnie Rhodes. Yes, yes! Winnie, your book has been a big success. What's next? Fiction actually. Yeah, my next book started out as something just for me. But then I thought, why not share it with the world? Yeah, I mean, after all, I can write whatever I want. Yes! Go, girl! That's what I'm talking about! For so long, all I wanted was to be successful. I mean, so much so that I didn't actually really care what the cost was. And then I, uh... I ended up losing someone that meant a lot to me because of it. - Dad! Dad, come here! Dad. - What? - You have to watch this. - Nope. - Well, hey, hey... - Nope! If you're not gonna watch it, at the very least, you have to listen! And I'm actually working on a novel right now, which is about finding someone who is perfectly imperfect. It's called Luck Strikes. Is this about the Player? It's, um... It's actually about two people. Yeah, the Player is a package deal. Yeah, he has a son. A really, really wonderful son. And I once told him, his son, that honesty is the best policy. Because that's what my dad taught me. So, uh, yeah, I feel like the best way to honour him is to finally be honest. She's going to grand gesture. My time with the Player, as you all know it, was a mess. It was. But you know, it wasn't entirely how I portrayed it. Wow. No, it wasn't all embarrassing and torturous. Skeetly-beh-bah! Most of it was actually... really fun. And exciting, and... It was love. I'm sorry to my readers for not being true to myself. Because the truth is, I fell hard. And I put my work ahead of that because I had to play a character. But that's not who I am. So I'm sorry. That's my best friend. But, uh... no apology is complete without a grand gesture, So... here goes. Called it. - Oh, I think she's gonna sing. - No way. It had to be you... It had to be you... I wandered around and finally found... somebody who... made me be true. Sorry. Oh no... Shibbity-do, bada-dee-bada-shoo. Oh! Shoopity doo! Oh, that feels good. What is she doing? Oh... Oh, this is really... It had to be you! You, you, you, you! Shibbity-shibbity-shibbity! It had to be you. It's 'cause he did that. Anyway... It had to be you! Wow. I love you, Winnie. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. - So? - So? So what? So let's go get her! I mean, she loves you and you love her. Isn't this kind of obvious? Yeah, but- - When a girl grand gestures, the guy has to go on this big dramatic chase to reunite with her. Everybody knows that! How do you even know this? You're wasting time! Just grab your keys, let's go! - Okay. Yeah, let's go! - Hurry up! Winnie! Hi. Uh, I don't know what that was back there, but... I should have listened to you more. I should have listened to your ideas. You're obviously very passionate. And I like to have a certain amount of control over my brand, and maybe that can hinder progress. I apologize. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And I would love to help you publish your next book. Even fiction. Yeah, you know, I'm gonna take some time away from Mush. You know, just really give this writing thing a try on my own. I quit. Thank you, Inga. You're the best. Winnie! Did you guys just sprint here? That was the mother of all grand gestures. It was, wasn't it? But your singing... That bad? Marginally better than mine, but... I read your column. It wasn't all bad. Some of it was actually pretty nice. I should have told you. Okay, I should have quit a while ago but... But I finally did today. I got rid of Dirk. You were right, I was too focused on money. Just kiss her! Do you want to stand in an absurdly long line and get some ramen? - Absolutely not. - Yes! - No! Never! - Come on! Yes! - I think we should go to... - Ramen! One of the fine restaurants that I sprinted by in a blur. - Come on, Ty. - No lines. Subtitling: difuze
