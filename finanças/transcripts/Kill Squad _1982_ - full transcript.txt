We're silky Arthur. Will see. But first we got to talk about this investment we made in this million-dollar scheme of yours. The pet bug. It's been eight months now and the only thing we've seen is the red carpet in your office, three inches thick. And the mahogany desk in this Mercedes. Oh yes, this suit. Hey, all you got to do is ask. Look, I got 10.000 transfers coming in from Arizona. I got 5.000 scorpions flying all the way in from Mexico. And centipedes. Can you believe this with your own ears? I've got 3.000 centipedes coming in from Death Valley. - Cut the crap papa! - Hey it's no bull. I wouldn't lie to you about 3.000 centipedes. Look I got four colored flyer coming out of the printers at the end of the week. I got ads, coming out all the major magazines next month. This is all straight stuff. Believe me. - Trust me. - Okay. We trust you Arthur, but we'll be back to check on our investment. You, I quit! You're crazy man and I never want to work for you again! Not ever! - Who's that? - My secretary. What's the matter with you Lola? The IRS just threw me out and put a padlock on the office door that's what! Hey man, we can't play. I didn't bring my ball. Okay Arthur, okay. You got one week to get the money back. - Hey allright. - Allright. Hey Arthur, Joe and the squad needs you. No problem! - You Mr. Ludwig? - Yes sir. I'm Mr. Levy from the Bank of San Jose and... the reason I'm here sir is, you're four months behind on your payment sir and you don't pace of payments I'm gonna have to reposition your car. - You're a businessman. - Yeah. You wanna invest in a million-dollar idea? What are you talking about? Pet bugs. - You're crazy! - Pet bugs, yeah. You wanna buy a Tarantula? 13,95$... No that's crazy. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. What are you talking about? Mr Ludwig? Mr. Ludwig? Your car. All the men are here Joe. I didn't get the much detail with them but enough to give them a rough idea and everyone is glad and proud to be tp help you. Very good. Excellent! Still the squad clown. Huh Arthur? But deadly. And you my friend? Same Squad Joe. First, you men don't realize how proud I am to have you here with me again. I sincerely mean that. And I want to thank you. Let's get down to business. We believe the motive behind all of this is that my wife and I, would not sell the electronics company. For the past four months we've had threatening phone calls. My wife and... We thought it would.. We thought it would pass. What Joe is trying to say is, that we think one of the larger electronics corporations is behind this. Joe had heard the killer's, call their leader Dutch. That's the man we have to get to. Now we do have one lead and one lead only. His name is Virgil. And he lives on an abandoned ranch with about eight or ten cowboy types. That's not much to go on, but at least it's some place to start. Okay man, go to work. Go get dutch. You bring back the man they call Dutch to me. Excuse me please but I'm looking for a gentleman named Virgil? A gentleman named Virgil? Who are you what do you want? My business is with Virgil! Holy shit! You got business with one of our partners, you got business with all. I said I have business with just one bastard here and that's Virgil. What you say nigga? I know it's gonna be hard to distinguish, but I said I'm looking for the cowboy that looks and smells like the asshole of a horse. Oh horseshit. - All right lady who are you. - My name is Angela. All right Angela now we came here for some answers and we're not leaving until we get some. We want to know about a pier called Dutch. I don't know anyone called Dutch. Well your boyfriend work for this man called Dutch a couple of months ago. Okay. Okay. We got wasted one night he bragged about messing up this dude and his old lady. Did he mention any names, places or anything? Come on lady anything? Jesse. Does it sound like one? Yeah! Jesse that's the one he's a truck driver works for cement company in town. Anybody else? Anybody else? Georgie, he works in a steel yard, now that's all I know so leave me alone! I found out that they're only two cement companies in town. The quick dry cement company and the Antonio brother cement Incorporated. And the one they call Jesse works for one of them. As for the other one Georgie we have a pretty good idea. Just about where at the steel yard, we might find him. I think it'd be a good idea to split up into two teams. Larry, you, K.C... and Pete. Go to Antonio brothers cement company first then to quick-dry. Alan you Tommy and Art, you go to the steel yard and have a talk with Georgie. That's all now. Excuse me sir. Do you have a guy named Jesse James working here? Jesse James? No I never heard of. Well if he's not here, there's just one cement company left. We're coming to get you Jesse James and I hope you have the Dalton brothers with you because we're coming to get you baby. Yeah. Hello? - Is this Dutch? - Who wants to know? Virgil's dead man. Wasted by a bunch of guys from a John Wayne movie and they're after you. They want you man and they want you bad. Hey, how'd you get my number? From Virgil since your demand if I ever needed any action or extra cash to give you a call since you were the man to talk to and then those exact words. Who are you? Jake. Jake. Aha. Okay. Okay Virgil has told me about you, what do you want? These guys want your ass man. Real bad. You must have done some heavy stuff to get them to call out the marines.
