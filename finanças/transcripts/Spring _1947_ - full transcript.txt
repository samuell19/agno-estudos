PETKER The beginning Listen, my comrade, Listen, my friend: Love and protect Your dear homeland. The great Soviet people, One and all, For the sake of freedom, Be it storm or hard times, Pursue their ideal, Their ideal goal. Lady! Where is the Dogs Ground, please? I'm not from Moscow. Sorry. Excuse me, what time is it now? 12 hours 45 minutes Moscow time. 45 hours 12 minutes. - I found her! - Where? - Whom? - I don't know yet. They keep pursuing us, Arinushka! What do they want? I guess, they liked one of us. - Nonsense. - Not at all. Easy - they are slowing down. I'll go and find out, Arkady Mikhailovich. Good afternoon. - Guests - through that gate. - Thank you. Academy of Sciences The Solar Institute Leonid Maximovich, where are you going? It's her herself! - Mister, don't. - Don't what? Don't everything! Hands up! - Look... - Turn around. I'll see into this. The sunlight reaches the Earth, and it is only its one billionth fraction that the humankind needs for energy purposes. And this energy we shall make to serve Man. These are our solar traps. - So, you are a film director? - Assistant director. Guards! Any other trespassers? Okay. Turn towards the light. - Your name? - Mukhin. Correct. - So you work in cinema? - Yes. My name is Vladimir Bubentsov. Ivan Kuzmich, be ready. Fifty... Stop, stop! Let's have a break. Everyone is dismissed. I can't understand, why you are interested in Nikitina of all people? - She is a famous scientist! - Worse than ordinary. The whole world watches how she catches the sun. - We all catch something in this life. - It's different! No, it is not. Everyone can catch the sun. And if you can't, you'll come to no harm. But preparing these sun-catching phials is a real sweat! - A job of unknown heroes! - We can shoot you, too. - Shoot me? For what? - I mean, film you. Oh, there is no need to. But I can provide you with all kind of scientific props. - For example? - Let me show you. Jaw-dropping thingies! We can make you a scientific consultant in our film. - Will it be much work? - Just get phials and so on. That would do. I'll tell you this: I'll work anywhere to skip work. It's a deal then. Let's go. Come in. - As I promised. - What is this? A top-secret gadget. What a gadget! I would like to have it in our film. I'll try. We also have this. What's going on? - Oh, my God. - One mo... Why did you let in strangers here? - I'm not a stranger. - You'll be reprimanded. I'm the director's assistant! - The worse it is for him. - Exactly. An earned remark. Because there was a funny and silly misunderstanding. We are making a film about a scientist like you, we were looking for someone like you. You resemble yourself so much that we mistook you for her. Please accept our deepest apologies. Apologies accepted. Have you finished? Aren't you interested in our film at all? - I'm afraid you won't make it work. - Why? Because there is nothing fun or entertaining about my job. It's a serious business. But our film is serious business too. I've seen such films. You need effects, not facts. Stunts, jokes, and tales. - Fairytales. - Tales. But fairytales possess strong power, they make people cry and laugh, they educate, they enrich our lives. - I'm not a fan of cinema. - Very good. Why are you happy about it? While working on the film, I've come up with a certain picture of you, and I'm very glad I wasn't mistaken, and you are exactly as I imagined. - All the best. - Goodbye. - How do you like her? - She is horrible! Oh no, she is wonderful! The way she should be! Look for a type of actress like her. We need our heroine to be exactly like Nikitina! "Wanted: an actress looking like this portrait" Vera! Why are you late? I was kept at the theatre. Oh, I'm so nervous, uncle Lyona. I know nothing about cinema. And my performance is too scenic. - Maybe I shouldn't? - Oh no! He needs exactly that. - Oh, I'm so nervous! - Just keep in mind how we performed. Concentrate. Let's go! Arkady Mikhailovich! I brought a musical number as promised. Oh, you and your musical numbers! Have you found an actress resembling Nikitina? You want me to find her double? Doubles don't exist. Don't exist? And what is this? Masha, Zina, come here. - So, try harder. - Know how to look! Vera! Arkady Mikhailovich, meet actress Shatrova, I told you about her. - What can you do? - Satirical songs, tap dancing. We performed together, she's my student. Let's see. Tatiana Ivanovna! Please give them a hand. We'll need this grand piano, please. Arkady Mikhailovich, we are pressed for time. Uncle Lyonya, you may begin. Gloomy man, he walked along the street With a black briefcase of patent leather Birds were singing something very sweet It was April, and the finest weather Birds were singing, all the bores to move. But the spring that man did not approve In his mind April was something wrong, For the businessmen don't need no song For him April meant nothing good And the bright sun spoiled his mood Even the melting snow he put to blame But - all the same The snow will melt! The spring is felt! Oh, what a happy symphony! Every tree stump Wants to grow up And to become a real tree! Come here. Don't you think she looks like Nikitina? Maybe you're right. You see how he sees? She's the spitting image of Nikitina! Great, isn't it? Yes, but it won't do. - But why? - Won't do. But you said yourself she looks like Nikitina. She will need a complete transformation, then it'll do. Can she play serious roles? Arkady Mikhailovich, she's in opera by accident, she's a dramatic actress. Maybe... Vera, you really look like that scientist. You've a chance to play that role! The Sun weighs two octillion tons... - Three octillion... - Wait, wait. You see, you are playing a scientist, someone living in the isolated world of formulas, a hermit kind of, working for the future in complete isolation, ignoring all earthly joys. See? I see, thank you. Okay, let's make a phototest. Please, make a serious expression! Don't forget, you're a scientist. Good. Attention! Don't move! Something is wrong. Let's try once more. That consultant Bubentsov is here. Bring him here. I'm not really liking the softness of your expression. A scientist should look more serious. - I understand, Arkady Mikhailovich. - Put on spectacles. That's better. And - a briefcase. Make a stern impression. Look here. And even more stern. Good. Let's do it! Hello, comrades! And here is the glass paraphernalia. Be careful! Irina Petrovna! I'm just showing them! I'll take it back to the academy this second! She's not Nikitina. She's our actress, Vera Shatrova. An actress? The resemblance is uncanny! - Well, if our consultant thinks so, - It's great! - let's do it. Vera Georgievna, get ready. - Vera's good! - How so? Attention! Look stern! Shoot it! Let's proceed from this image. "Photo test accepted" He wrote "accepted", but I categorically write, "denied"! - But you are the director! - So what I am! I've been practically doing nothing for 6 years in this theater. We all have been doing next to nothing in this theater. Fine, today you're not doing anything, but tomorrow you may be appointed, to do nothing still. But a day after you may get your greatest role! - This is ridiculous! - But, Akaky Petrovich... Shatrova - to the stage! Sorry. Do you really think she has a talent? - Who? - That Shatrova. Yes. Why? Let us try to be logical. She wants to star in a film because we're not giving her roles here. - Yes, but... - Wait... Uncle Lyonya! Well? - You must be at the studio by ten to read the script. - But I can't. If I let her, her star may start shining, god forbid. - That would be great. - Great for her, great for you. But not for me. What do I do then? I should give her a leading role at the theatre so she wouldn't get one in film. - Your last name? - Ovechkin. Thanks. That's what I will do! You will only have to sit and listen. Remember, you've been accepted, but not approved yet. But the stage director said "no". Shatrova - to the director. Do what you want, I won't be at the main rehearsal tomorrow! Shatrova, come here. Your last name? - Shatrova. - Good. And you really know the role of the Ice Bride? - Yes. - Wait a minute! - But I can't. - Then go to the trade union boss. - And you know the dancing part? - Yes. - And you showed it? - Yes, they liked it. - What? - They liked it. Tomorrow you'll be rehearsing the main role. Be ready by ten. - Aren't you happy? - Sorry, I'm happy. Very good. Hey, wait, are you crazy? Oh, how quiet... The night alighted on the earth. I'm absolutely at a loss! Vera, calm down! If I won't show up for the main rehearsal, I will simply get fired. You should choose between theatre and cinema. There is no way out. But there is a way out... But this is crazy! - But you should try. - Okay. Is this Nikitina's apartment? Yes, professor Nikitina's apartment. No, she doesn't come home so early. Group two - to the stage. Please, will you talk for me. Hello? She will be home all day tomorrow? That's great! We'll come and see her. Nikitina will be at home all day tomorrow. Oh, I'm so nervous! It'll be all right. Arinushka, I'm rushing to feed you breakfast. I decided to make a vegetable salad for lunch. Vegetables are good for energy. Very good. Arinushka, I have a serious question for you. Have you ever been burning up from love? No. Oh, love is such a sweet dream. Oh, what a cute thing! What is this? I think, it's a hat. Where did you get it? They sent it to me from the Fashion House. Oh, how lovely. May I try it on? Please do. Oh! Beauty is a scary power! May I wear it? I'll be back soon. I must go to the market and then - to the housing office. Captain, captain, smile... Arinushka, I will take "The Idiot", lest I feel bored in the trolley-bus. It's here. Should someone come, you will have to answer the door. "The Idiot" Oh, my darling... - You mean, it's her? - Oh, no. - I'm scared. - Don't be. And press your point. How can I help you? - Hello, comrade Nikitina. - Hello. Who are you? I'm Shatrova, I'm an actress, and I need to talk to you. I'm very busy at the moment, sorry. I know. But I'm pleading you. Who sent you? I'm an actress. And I play you in a film. - You? - Yes. Well, come in. Come in. Sit down. I'm listening. If only you could come to the studio instead of me for half an hour, and I'd run to the theater... - You must be crazy! - Why? You will only have to sit there listening to the script. - Listen to what? What script? - A script about you. I won't allow to be made into some movie jokes. No, you are absolutely wrong. It might be an interesting film wonderfully showing your life and your work. My work? The less they know about my work - the better. I can imagine what they wrote there. You think I won't be able to play this role? But I will do my best! I've already rehearsed. I've already started getting into character... Look, please. The Sun weighs three octillion tons, it shines with the intensity of two octillion candles. Well? So, is this how your director pictures me? Yes, because, you know, a scientist is like a hermit, seeing the future and not paying attention to the present day. First of all, it's a big exaggeration, and, secondly, totally wrong. Although, I'm not surprised they're making an "Interesting Facts" spectacle out of me. I dreamt so much to play this role. I'm sorry. Good bye. Wait! So, you said, a scientist is a hermit? That's what the director said. Give me your coat. I should look into this matter. So, you are coming? Our car is over there. - What happened? - Who knows. We're being late. Get down. Let's go. One moment. I'd better take the trolley bus. Okay. Thank you very much! So, she refused? As cold as a fish. Someone is remembering you. Where shall I take you? Please, mind your tone. Gogol was about good things in life. - Yes, but Belinsky... - To the movie set! Arrange your make-up. - He looks like one! - And you look too much - like Nikitina today, too. - Oh, really? Good afternoon, Vera Georgievna. You remember our yesterday's conversation? - "A scientist is a hermit", right? - Exactly. - You don't agree with me? - No, I don't. - In my opinion... - I'm sorry, we did agree yesterday? What's going on with you? She got so into the character even I have trouble recognising her. We won't be reading the script. Let's make another photo test. Make her ready, I'll be on the set. - It won't take much time. - I'm going home, now! Show me the way out! - Irina Petrovna! - Show me the way out! Vera... Irina Petrovna! I'm almost through. I know scientists inside out. - What is that? - It's our consultant Bubentsov. They have everything on a silver plate, I bring them everything: all apparatuses and gadgets. - What about discoveries? - What about them? Without me they can't discover anything! - Any questions? - Who are you? I'm a scientific consultant. Well, and they work like this. It's simple. I know all their secrets. You sit down, you think and you make a discovery. The most important thing is to think, like this and - it's a cinch! Pythagorean jungle is the sides of triangle. Ah, Vera dear. Have a smoke break, fellows. Did you hear my briefing? Useful for you. If you have any scientific questions, ask me. - What are you doing here? - Hey, hey, You won't scare me today. Uncanny. Only I'm not going to buy this joke of yours, so, enough is enough. What are you doing on the movie set? Earning an odd penny, you know. Any work to not work, right? Comrade Bubentsov! Sorry, people need my consultation. Where is your director? Shatrova, excuse me... Will this dress do? - I think it's nice. - Good. We should put an end to this masquerade. Everyone is starting to mistake me with Shatrova. Maybe you should stay? They think you are Vera, and you have a chance to look into the matter. Maybe you are right. Maybe I should look into this matter closely. - It's a good chance. - Oh, you are a holy woman! - What should I do? - Make-up, dress-up, filming. Very well then. It's none of her business, you know, whether I go in for sport or not. - Is the actor Fenin ready? - Yes. - My one moustache is a bit longer. - So what. Her business is to provide me with plimsolls, and the rest is none of her business, I can even sleep in these plimsolls, so what. What did you do to your face today? Let's get rid of this detail. You are not like yourself at all today. - Oh, really? - She doesn't look like Nikitina. - Indeed! - You look too grotesque for her, as we say in our institute, dried shark. - What? - That's how they call her. - Indeed! - Stop it. - I'm the consultant here. - Be careful with talents. They don't wear such lips nowadays. Let's look for another ones. ...And, imagine, they want me to go on holiday, as if I can have a holiday with such nerves. No, these won't do. Let's take these ones. Medium type, sex appeal number 4. And the nose - the shape is absolutely wrong. No, I don't think so. Tampon! - Another tampon. - Enough. I look like Nikitina without your tampons! That's what you think. Look at your face. So tasteless. We'll make a real Nikitina out of you. Do as you wish. - Excuse me. - Enough, Shura. I've been building her talent for 6 years! What's her name? - Shavrova. - It's Shatrova. Nevermind. She's my protege! Wonderful! Let me kiss your hand. What's your last name? - Shatrova. - Well done, Shatrova. Bravo. - What do you want me to do? - Vera Georgievna, you must believe that you are a real scientist. - Can you do this? - I think I can. You remain aloof to everything and everyone in the world. You're deep in the world of formulas. I think, you have a wrong picture about scientists. - They are not like this. - What do you mean? I know Nikitina, she's like that. We'll do it like we did yesterday. Bring over a table and a book. Although no, better take the script. Open it and read it. Remember? - "She reads something and reacts with indignation." - Go ahead. - Arkady Mikhailovich, here. Shatrova, why are you not doing anything? - I'm reading. - It doesn't look like you're making a discovery. Nibbling a pencil is a cliche, also Nikitina is not a pencil-nibbler. She does indeed have that habit. Honey, who cares about habits! It's a bad example for the masses! People will begin nibbling at their pens, pencils, etc. We need Nikitina caring for her pencil, - for her tool! - Don't disturb me. Shatrova, your polemistic mood will bring you to nothing. It's polemic, not polemistic. I refuse to work with this lady! She has no idea about scientific discipline. She absolutitively can't play a scientist. It's absolutely, not absolutitively. Stop compromising me - I can't work in such atmosphere. - Then go away. - I'm taking away the props. - Go ahead. - Great! Excuse me, where is the trade union's room? I'll go and complain to the trade union. Please, I want this type to never appear here again. Nonsense! This is ridiculous! Very good. Try to be more emphatic! - Nonsense! - Very good. Let's begin then. Silence - we are in the process - What is she doing? - She knows. The light!... Silence! Let's begin. What? What are you doing? Turn off these lights! - Turn them off! - What's wrong? I don't like the script. You want to make a film about scientists, but you yourself know nothing about them. - I think she is crazy. - Uh huh. Our Soviet scientists are at the very center of modern life. This is what is important! They want to tame the Sun to make lives easier, better. They think not only about formulas, but also about human happiness. They are human, and they live like humans. And you want to show a bookworm, some sort of hermit instead of a Soviet scientist. I don't see any soul in this script, and your soul, too. This is what I wanted to tell you. Although, do as you wish. He'll throw her out. Vera, what's wrong? You're tired. - I feel unwell. - Break! You really feel unwell? Have some rest then. Show her to her room. - She's sure the opera type. - Wait! I think she's a very interesting person. Where is Shatrova? The rehearsal is over. She must be at your home now. - I'll go and bring her. - What about me? - Go on feeling unwell. - But how? Pretend having a headache. Oh, you're such a wonderful person. Stay here. And I'll bring Vera in 40 minutes. Please, put me through to professor Melnikov. - Hello? - Aunt Pasha, it's Irina Petrovna speaking. Please tell the professor I can't come today. Ivan Nikolayevich, Irina Petrovna called. - Oh, yes, I couldn't reach her. - She isn't coming. - But why? - I don't know. Here I am. Good evening. - Good evening. The press is late as per usual. - The transport is to blame. - Victor Semyonovich, you came in your car? - Sure thing. My dear sir, do a kind deed and bring Irina Petrovna to me. Nikitina? You mean, she didn't come yet? - No. - Because I need her, too, for an interview about solar experiments. I'll get her. - Do you know her address? - Nikitna's? Ah no, I don't. - I think you've met her before here, remember? - I very well do. No matter what she says, grab her and bring her here. Professor I. Nikitina. The Sun weighs two octillion tons, yes, two octillion tons... It shines with the intensity of 3 octillion candles. Hello Good afternoon. - Ivan Nikolayevich is waiting for you. - I can't today, I'm busy. Maybe some next time. - Everyone is waiting. - Everyone? Excuse me, we haven't seen each other in almost two years. Perhaps you don't remember me? When you wait for someone, time always flies fast. - Excuse me, is it you? - Of course. I was joking. Goodbye. Wait. First of all, Ivan Nikolayevich is waiting for you. - Second, I need to talk to you. The journal ordered me to... - Sorry. I'm busy. Let's go. Oh, the confusion. Here's what, Shatrova. It looks like you're not an actress. To fall ill on the first day! An acrobat falls down and hits himself, but he finishes his number with a smile. And feels pain only after the show is over. He's an artist, and you? You can only discuss, preach, critisise, but when it comes to you, you fall apart like a little girl! I'm ready to forgive you a lot of things, but to put the entire project at risk of your nervous system, that I cannot. Sure, but that's my first time. And I'm very nervous. I'm also very nervous! It helps in work. In any case, I give you 5 minutes for all your opera suffering. After 6 minutes you won't need to worry about the job at all. Wait. Fine, I'm coming. It's just I forgot everything from my nerves. Remind me, what did we do yesterday? Now that's business, you should've started with that. Of course, we'll rehearse everything again. Let's go. Milder, milder, don't get too obsessed with Nikitina. Let's go. There we are. Wait, I forgot to stop the engine. Uncle Lyonya, thank god you are here! I don't know what to do! The concert begins in half an hour! Nikitina is very nervous at the studio, too. Damn, what a confusion. It's all right. Get acquainted, please. That's a man from the studio, he came to pick me up. - Roschin. - Mukhin. No, we won't let Irina Petrovna leave us today. And you stay, too. - What to do! I'm scared! - It's all right, don't be. I'm with you. You're lucky. Vera, you're in the thick of the scientific world. Examine it, analyse, check your role. Play Nikitina. The way you rehearsed it with Arkady Mikhailovich. - Right away like that? - Why not? Go ahead. - You at last. Hello, dear. - Hi. Only I'll have to go home soon. Mukhin from the film studio. - We make a film about scientists. - Glad to meet you. - There's a phone call for you. - One moment. Sorry. Do come in. - Where are we? - At the solar institute. And who is that man? No idea, but I'm finding out! Smile, don't be so tense. Very good. I'll be back in a moment. I think 8 million volt will be enough. Good evening, Irina Petrovna. Don't you remember me at all? Good evening. Sorry, we've never met. - Professor Kozyrev. - Who doesn't know professor Kozyrev! I was made professor only yesterday. And I called you professor only today. Oh, absent-minded as per usual. So, speaking about the voltage... Uncle Lyonya, - let's go away. - No. Use your chance. Look, here's a real scientific office. I'll call Nikitina. Only don't be long. Irina Petrovna! What are you doing here? It can't be that you can't stop working even when visiting. I'm sorry. Let's go outside. Listen to me, an old man, admire the moon, take a walk with this young gentleman, and forget about work. One, two, three... Okay? Okay. I understand one doesn't want to talk business during such a night. But I'm a journalist above all. Can I ask you one question? - No, no questions. - Irina Petrovna! Really! Talking business at a friendly gathering. Enough is enough. Where are you running to? What are you afraid of? - One question. - No questions. The editorial office wanted me to ask you... - Sing. - Sing what? - The spring is felt... - What are you talking about? Oh, what a happy symphony! Don't you know this marvelous song? You only have experiments and discussions here. Show how scientists live. What do they talk about at home, how they relax, have fun, I don't know... Let your heroes sing, even. Oh, I can't agree with that one at all. I'm confident, scientists do not sing. And now - altogeher. No, no... No, like this... No, no... Very good. I don't recognize her! It's been a year since I heard her sing! Oh, what a charming woman! - Who asked you to sing? - Why not? Nikitina doesn't sing. We need to run. - Will I be in time for the concert? - Yes. - Soon? - Wait a minute. - Maybe I should change? - Okay. Arkady Mikhailovich, Shatrova approved this dress in the morning, and now she doesn't like it. You don't? You know, I'm fine with everything now. Let scientists dance, sing. Let Nikitina do an armstand. You were asking for it. - What else do you not like? - It's not like that. I wanted... You yourself don't know what you want at this point. Where do I put them? The diplomats? Bring them here. Hey, guys! Come here. The film will have a meeting with these gentlemen. How do you think a leading Soviet scientist should greet them? You'll wear this dress. Let's go - You may go. - What? Don't worry. A test photo. Attention. Go ahead. Attention! Look in the camera. Thank you. Take away the fur coat. I will need you for one minute. You can have a smoke, we'll call for you. Comrade Mukhin! Have you seen Irina Petrovna? No, but I... It's you? - Right. - What's this? - I prepared a surprise. - Irina Petrovna feels unwell. - Very unwell. - She is going home. - Yes, I'm going home. - Home? No, I brought you here and I will take you home. His car is out of order. Let's go. - I'd better walk. - Great! Let's walk. Don't worry. Irina Petrovna will be home in a few minutes. Home? Whose home? Nikitina's home? Yesterday you agreed to everything, today you deny it all. Fine, let's think of something. You think we need to show her inner world? - Something personal, right? - Of course, otherwise she'd be a mannequin. Let's say, we'll show her love. - What? - Yes, Nikitina's love. That's an idea! A scientist can love and should love! Enough discussions, let's try it out. Say, for example, "I love you". - Right away? - Why, sigh first then. Vera Georgievna, I don't think you entirely understand what love is. Tatiana Ivanovna, do we have materials about love? Bring some to us. "Quotations about love" "Love is elated poetry, exultation, things holy and refined" - Hertzen. - Right. Or: "The most beautiful part of life is hidden from those "as have never loved..." Here! Something in your gaze already. Let's solidify it. Look at me and confess your love for me. Attention... Go ahead. I can't, Arkady Mikhailovich. Sadly, this is too hard for me. Then try to express your feelings without words - by your movements, gestures, eyes... - What is this? - Our time is over for today. Now it's another film, another crew. - May I stay? - Of course. It will be very useful for you. How sweet and sad your apparition, Oh, spring, oh spring, season of love: I feel it now come to fruition, Run through my veins on your behalf. Let's come closer. Overwhelmed with sentiments the same She fell in love - her season came. The seed that slumbered in the ground, Warmed by spring, now gave a sprout. Oh how she played with imagination And taxed her romantic mood, Waiting for love, that fatal food... Her heart naive, her heart homespun Waited for him - for anyone! That moment came, like in a dream, And she exclaimed: "It's him... It's him..." I can't stop thinking about what you said. You know, Vera Georgievna, not many young artists would dare to speak to me as boldly as you have. I'm very grateful to you for this. It's nothing. I only wanted to defend a woman who I resemble so much. - Good bye. - Good bye. That's enough for today. See you tomorrow. - And what is there? - Another movie set. - May I have a look? - Of course. Also, do wear this dress. It will be useful. Oh, wondrous moment, when I saw you, A picture that will fade anon, The fleeting angel, my sweet lady, The beauty's purest paragon... Of all humankind I sing praise to my dear country, My young republic, My homeland! - It's all so interesting! - You think? But Nikitina thinks - it's all nonsense. - A fairytale! - A tale! - A fairytale! This Gogol says with this intonation: "the world would be dull without fairytales". - Exactly. - The world would be dull without tales! - What do you think? - What are you arguing about? We came for an audition. And we had an argument. - Maybe you'll help us? - Give it to me. Sorry, Vera Georgievna. "Fairytales!.." Centuries passed by, cities and generations disappeared, swept away by Time like smoke, but fairytales go on living, being retold. Yes, "fairytales"! The world would be dull without them. Life would become shallow, Our souls overgrown with spiderweb... "Fairytales..." That's how I would read it. - Right you are. - Yes... Thank you, Arkady Mikhailovich. See? Only at a film studio you can see two Gogols at the same time, and both fake. Well, I must go. Goodbye. Lena, see Vera Georgievna out. Haven't you ever seen the Moon? Of course, I have. Only I never paid attention. The day became longer, Spring begins... The lilac is in blossom, Your soul yearns for love. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about you spoiling my entire day, - and Nikitina's entire character. - But I am right, after all. You are in general, but when it comes to Nikitina, even her colleagues call her a dried shark. I think it's rather a superficial opinion. I think it's for a reason. What do you want when she rejects art. You, for example, didn't want to leave the studio, whereas she refused to discuss the mere idea of the film. I think she was wrong on that account. - I'll get home myself. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. If only Nikitina could see all this. Maybe she's out right now too. You know, if I saw her right now on the street, in the company of a gentleman, I would've thought I'd gone crazy. No, Irina Petrovna is at home right now, behind curtains drawn shut. - Are you so sure? - Yes, because... No, Irina Petrovna! I will walk you home! It's her! With a gentleman! Unbelievable! Vera Georgievna, where are you? Two!.. One... None... Vasily Grigorievich, we need to clarify our relations. On Wednesday, in the housing office, you said you had seen me in your dreams... So what? It means that you like me? Well, yes. What do you like the most in me? Your apartment. What? - What did you say? - Ahem... I said, your eyes. Understand? Now I can see! It's her! Take everything away. No!.. Bye! Good evening, Margarita Lvovna. - Anyone called? - No. What's wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me. What's wrong with your hair? I'm sorry, I did the permanent wave. And I dyed my hair with red streptocid. That's awful. - What's going on? - Oh, don't ask me. Another personal tragedy? Oh, what a punishment! It's you? Yes, it's me. Arinushka, what's going on with YOU? Oh, don't ask me. - What was that? - Mousies! Mousies... Yes?.. Now I know what you're like. You don't need my passion, you need this apartment. Get out. - And return my letters. - Okay. We've come too high. Yes, too high. - Who is there? - It's us. It's him, it's him... - Good evening. - Irina Petrovna, see you tomorrow. Okay. Excuse me... Irina Petrovna! Your coat! 47,7... Irina Petrovna, it's me. Auditory hallucinations now... You've changed beyond recognition! Emergency service? Servergency emergice? Delirium tremens, tremirium delers... Who is ill? I am ill... Margarita Lvovich... Lev Margaritovich... Come urgently! That's how it all happened. How interesting. Vera, dear, tell me the truth, do you like Victor Semyonovich? If only you could hear him talk about his love, his love towards you! He does not know me. He talked about his love for you. But he called me Irina. He doesn't even know about my existence. I wish that all his words were meant for you, not me. Everything got so confusing. What will happen at the studio? It'll be a real scandal. Don't rush to conclusions. We should both go and find out. This is what we should do. You will go to the studio and talk to the director. - You think so? - And I'll go to the institute. Who can she be talking to? To herself? Who can I be talking to? To myself too. Means I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you very much, good night... - Come in. - It's 7 o'clock already... Margarita Lvovna! Margarita Lvovna, what happened? What's wrong? Nothing special. I have gone mad. Vera, give her a hand. Emergency service. - Where is your ill lion? - Who? Lev Margaritovich. It's me... Good morning, Irina Petrovna. Good morning, aunt Agasha. Shall I take away the flowers? No, let them stay. We need to change everything here, aunt Agasha. She is right. We need to change everything. Everything! The script needs to be reviewed and reworked. What are these sets? No, she's right. And this won't do either. We must know the material we're working with, no making things up. We need to observe, study. What we see once shouldn't be taken for a rule. Anything can happen once. I won't let this happen again! Everything is fake! - What happened? - He is mad, and how! Because of your discussions yesterday. I'm done for. - It's you? - Hello, Arkady Mikhailovich. Friends, look at this young actress, it's her first time at the studio- Wait! And she's an example to you! She's arguing with me with no fear, defending her point of view, and she is right. Thank you! Today Nikitina is holding a public experiment. Let's go to the Solar Institute. Today we shall demonstrate an experiment of accumulating the solar energy. The source of all energy on the Earth comes from the one source, and that is the solar energy. What is going to happen here? The solar energy concentrates on the sun-bearing liquid contained in this sphere. The liquid, being exposed to sunrays, accumulates the solar energy. Please, be seated. Irina Petrovna asked me to be your guide today. Nikitina? - Yes, there she is. Attention! Turn it on! Irina Petrovna, be careful. Alright, experiments are great, but I can go to a crematorium at any time. One minute, uncle Lyonya. Editorial office? It's Victor Semyonovich. The experiment is in full swing. Let the stenographer write down my information. - Where you going? - I need to make a phone call. If the liquid doesn't evaporate and will stay at least for one minute, it will mean a revolution in science! And if it does evaporate? Then we'll go on with experimenting until the final result. Stop! Enough! What's the matter, laboratory? You can't go on, Irina Petrovna! It's none of your business. Full capacity! I'll need full capacity! Yes! We did it! Can I talk to Irina Petrovna? She must be in her office now. Just put a lab coat on. That would make a super lighter! Since I'm fired, I'll treasure it like a keepsake, so to say. Irina Petrovna! Every tree stump Wants to grow up And to become a real tree! What's happening? Who are you? It's me! You're mistaken, comrade Stump. - Vera, what's going on? - Keep him for a minute. - I need to talk to Irina Petrovna. - Alright! Irina Petrovna, are you here? Good evening. Good evening, Arkady Mikhailovich. - I want to congratulate you, comrade Nikitina. - I want to say... I know you are very busy, I won't take much of your time. - I want to apologize and say... - I only wanted to say that... When I saw your wonderful work, I fell in love for good now. - In love with whom? - With my Nikitina, with the scientist's image. I knew it wouldn't be with the original. Since the original is a dried shark. Dear Arkady Mikhailovich, I thought film directors, especially men, are more observant. No way. Arkady Mikhailovich, to whom were you explaining what love is yesterday? Was it really you? Margarita Lvovna! My dear! Go away. I despise you! They fired me from science - but don't fire me from your heart. Because, you know... Should you tell me to catch the Sun... Here you go. Oh, everything is hell with me... And this will happen to everyone who mistreats atomic energy! Not atomic - solar energy! God bless you. Even the flame can't take you. Oh, and I nearly loved this nobody... Oh, everything is hell... Was it really you? My god, the things I told you yesterday! How did you put up with it? It was useful for me. Looks like everyone needs to know what others think of them. - Comrade Roschin. - Yes, Irina Petrovna? I'm not quite Irina Petrovna. What do you mean not quite? And who is Irina Petrovna then? She is Irina Petrovna. You've muddled it all up for me, I no longer know what scientists are like, what you are really like, and what my film should be like. Make a film about what happened to all of us. Oh, no one will believe it. Why not? It would be amusing and educational. - But it would be a comedy. - Very good. But what will be its underlying issue? Let it be an issue of spring in a person's soul. Let it be a comedy about, let's say, some particularly dry scientists, just like you wanted. Then also about some, let's say, particularly superficial filmmakers, as you wanted. And about that there is more to life than we think. It's bad when for someone... For him April meant nothing good, And the bright sun spoiled his mood. Even the melting snow he put to blame, Yes, to blame! But - all the same The snow will melt! The spring is felt! Oh, what a happy symphony! Every tree stump Wants to grow up And to become a real tree! The bumblebee - a messenger of warm days, The birds are chirping, and there shines the Sun! They chirp and buzz, they sing and hum: The sping has come, the spring has come! FIN
