Now, your homework dealt with a very delicate case, in which a whole town was burned, and all the women were raped. So who would like to give us a cause and effect in this case? Okay, Bridget? - I think the Theopole was cause. - [Teacher] Okay. So we have an opinion that Theopole was the cause. Now, let's investigate this cause since it appears we have a perpetrator. Did he cause the rape? - We just gotta rap about it. - Why? - 'Cause I just ain't happy with what went down. - You were there. - [Teacher] Do you have an answer? - About what? - About the cause of the rape? - There wasn't a cause. - No, that's a fallacy. - I didn't cause it. (students laugh) - It just got out of hand. - Yes, certainly, Theopole did lose control, but- - Why did it ever start? - That is exactly what we're trying to find out here. - Somebody, yeah, somebody like you caused it. - Does anybody else have an opinion. - [Anita] Why don't you ask her about it. - [Donna] Shut your face! - [Steve] You stay the hell out of this! - No, no, no, everybody get involved. It's very stimulating. - Yeah, her, she knew about it. - You got a big mouth, squealer. - Would you please go back to your seat? - Butt out, teach. You accusing me?

Just a minute. (lively rock music) (van bangs) The creep had it coming. (chuckles) (truck rumbles) (tires screech) (lively rock music) Who's next? - 5647 Rayburn. - That's Brent's place. - How many we got? - 15. One more and we can smoke the rest. - All right. (truck rumbles) - Did you see that? - Yeah! - Watch this. (comical music) (truck bangs) - Here, throw these to them. - Aw, man, all my weed! (comical music) - Who's next? - Steve. - We'll fix that bastard. - He's not so bad. - He sucks! - Oh, it's just a screw up, Donna pulled some- - Bullshit! There ain't no excuses for yesterday. - I guess not. (comical music) - [Steve] Hey, Anita, come here! Come here! (truck rumbles) - [Jill] We sure fixed them. I'll drop you off at work. We'll just make it. (comical music) (lively rock music) - You guys have seen this shit? - [Man] Yeah. - You with me? - I don't know. - Yeah. - Man, we ain't gotta go. - The hell you say? Maybe you don't, but I do. - [Brent] What's the chance of losing? - I don't plan on losing. - How much time we got. - 45 minutes, why? - I guess I was hoping my old lady would drop by. - Hey, pal, do you mind if I just go along and watch? - I really don't care, I really don't. - Get the hell out of here. - I only wanted to listen. - [Steve] I said move it, you mother! - And that's all there is to it. If you don't wanna go, stay. - It doesn't make a lot of sense. - Sense or not, we've gotta stand up to them sometime. - Hey, hey, you ain't allowed out there without paying. - Screw you, old man! - You tell your friends to move or I'm calling the cops! - I don't think I wanna go. - What are you, some candyass or what? - I'm scared. - Get out of here, just get the hell outta here! - Hey, you better go down and pay. He'll call the cops. - Big deal. You expect me to sweat the fuzz when you give us this? Shit! And, because of you, somebody or just maybe lots of somebodies are gonna die. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. (lively rock music) - Look, if your friends don't buy nothing, we don't need them. You tell them that when you see them. - What does he mean someone's gonna die? - A drag out. If somebody loses- - [Boss] Anita, what the hell's going on? - What's a drag out, tell me! - He's gonna die! (lively rock music) - Hey, come back here! Ah, don't come back here! You ain't got a job! (lively rock music) - Dad! - What? - I have to borrow the car. - You don't have to do anything but get out of this room and let me sleep. - I gotta, Dad, I gotta stop something! - The answer is no! - I hate you, I hate you! (tense music) - You're not to leave this house! (tense music) Open the goddamn door! I said open the goddamn door! (tense music) (vehicles rev) - I'm sure we got him. - You bitch! - What the hell? - Stop, stop now! - Hey, man, cool your ass. - [Anita] But someone will die! - [Jill] Who cares? So long as it ain't I. - [Anita] I don't wanna do this. - It's his fault. - It doesn't matter whose fault it is! (vehicles rev) - Yeah, she's with 'em. Shit. (vehicles rev) - I can't. It's done. - You're all crazy! (vehicles rumble) - She started it, but she can't stay for the end. (vehicles rev) You bitch! (vehicles rev) (tense, dramatic music) - What the hell is she doing? (tense, dramatic music) - She's coming up here. She's crazy. (tense, dramatic music) (vehicles rev) (station wagon bangs) (suspenseful music) - Oh God, oh God. Please, don't take her from me, Lord. Come on, baby, please, be all right, come on. Come on, please. You're alive, she's alive, she's alive!
