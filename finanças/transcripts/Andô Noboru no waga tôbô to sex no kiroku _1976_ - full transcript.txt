- It's Koyama. - It's Shindo. Boss, we took care of it. Company President! Tetsushi Hayakawa Shot! A Ginza Evening, in the Company President's Office Henchmen from Shibuya's Ando-Group?

Well, you can't trust reports, can you? Not all that again... For now, just tell me about Hayakawa. He's regained consciousness. They say he'll be in recovery for two months. Longer than I expected. Apparently the bullet entered through his arm, bounced off a bone... ...entered his lungs and curved down into his intestines. A pretty rare case, huh? Hey, Funabashi, looks like you're pretty skillful after all! - What about the cops? - Yeah, about that... Damn, they're pulling out all the stops. With a shooting like this, it's not gonna go away so easy. They've got the 1st precinct, the 2nd, the 3rd all together. It's the biggest search since the Shimoyama incident. Ando, it's the timing. The government has been castigated and the cops are looking... ...to conquer the mountain and plant themselves another flag. If you're looking to win the popular vote... ...you've gotta use an incident like this as your arrowhead. It's ripe for the picking. Even the mass media's on board. They're taking to the battleground and gearing up... ...this big campaign to thoroughly flush out violent gangs. What, so Hayakawa was this big shot in the game... ...and I'm just an up-and-coming gang of hooligans? No, that's not it! So then you think Hayakawa's going to be able to come out on top? No, he'll never change. After two months he'll be back in health... ...and commandeering small to medium enterprises all over Japan. Ando... You're surrounded on all sides here! What are you gonna do? Run. With everybody watching this closely... ...it'd be a shame to be caught so quickly. "Noboru Ando's Fearless Challenge". That'll be the headline. - What's wrong with him? - Tuberculosis. He's been in bad shape for a while. I guess we put him through the ringer on this job too. That's right, other than me everybody here is a tuberculosis patient. Mori, yakuza bacteria is floating all around you. You probably shouldn't breathe. I'm leaving! Don't panic so quickly. We'll take you where you're going. Hey, Ando smiled and disappeared into his first safe house. Hey! And the villain has arrived. You're late. Yakko, was work good today? No sir! I'm the new girl who can't sell and my schedule is totally open. The princess-ing business doesn't fit well with the yakuza-ing business. "Noboru Ando's Fearless Challenge" This is the 9:00 news. This morning, the Metropolitan Police Department, in the midst of the... ... investigation into the shooting of Hayakawa Tetsushi, President of... ...Kyokuto Sentaku, has put Noboru Ando on the national wanted list. On the same list they have also put Shindo Hideo, a leader of Ando's organization... ...and members Koyama Hiroshi and Kawahara Kunihiko... ...under suspicion of attempted murder. As well as Hoshino Keizo, another organization leader... ...under suspicion of violation of the Swords and Firearms Control Act. Kawahara... So far, the investigation has determined that on the day of the incident... while meeting with Hayakawa in the afternoon to discuss debt issues... ...Ando suddenly cut the meeting short and returned to his office in Shibuya. He sent an order through Shindo to Kawahara, telling him to attack Hayakawa. To create an alibi, he accompanied Koyama to a hotel in Atami... ...and awaited the announcement of the incident. For his alleged involvement, a warrant was also issued for Hoshino for another... ... incident under suspicion of violation of the Swords and Firearms Control Act. As for Hayakawa, he is currently accommo- dated at Inoue Hospital awaiting... ...surgery for the bullet which is still lodged in the right side of his torso. Now, onto the next news report... It's like the plot of a movie! Kawahara... Well, I guess he does look a lot like Funabashi... - Huh? - Nothing. - Hello? - Yeah, It's me. - This is Koyama. Did you hear? - Yeah, I heard. Funny, right? Well... Kawahara is here now. What should we do? Alright, we'll dress it up like Kawahara was the shooter and have him run. Even if he gets picked up, have him stick to it all the way to court. Shindo and Funahashi will go to Yamanashi. Hoshino will stay in Tokyo and create distractions. And you'll move out with me. Everyone is to get a move on with their assignments today, got it? Don't get picked up. You run and you run and you run! Heeeere you go! Alright, let's dance! Everybody dance! Stop it! - Yakko, what are you doing? - I'm going on the run with you. I'm following you far, far away. I want to go too! You have no reason to go on the run with me. - I do too! - You can't. - No! - I said you can't! I want to go with you. Please! It'll be fine if I come along. I already told you no! - You idiot! - Please! Take me too! I want to be with you! - This isn't a game. - Please! I want to go! Take me! - Shut up! - Then take me! Take me! You don't get it, do you? You're still just a kid. Drive. - Where to? - Akasaka. No way, boss! The cops are watching her place like hawks. We're going because they're watching her. It's just one day, we'll be fine. It makes no sense to go from the safest spot to the most dangerous spot. Got it. She's there alright. What happened? They searched the house. What'd they take? A lot of things. Anything bad? You haven't been here in four months. There wouldn't be anything like that here. I'm the one on the run. Look, you can't even fold properly. You're so warm. Stop! Hold up! Wait! The reason behind all this is that there are too many criminal tricks... ...taught in weekly magazines, television, radio, etc. There is no doubt that this consequently gives rise to criminal syndicates. Now is the time that we most need civil organizations... ...dedicated to resisting violent gangs. Gathering our individual courage, with our combined power... ...we can shut down such violence. It is my dream that through this movement we may all enjoy our lives together. Everyone, let's build a clean amusement quarter... ...where we can help each other, bring tables out into the street... ...and laugh and smile with passers by! We must keep order in society... ...and not only extinguish criminal gangs in order to protect the ones we love... ...but also create a bright, fulfilling atmosphere for public life. Coffee's ready! How is it? Does it smell the same? Hey, you always used to say that you had no interest in being pursued... ...but could love someone that is pursued, right? And that you lived your life up until now like a beast on the hunt. That's how you came after me, anyway. How's it feel now, to be the one that is pursued? To be pursued implies you're running away from something. I'm not running away from anything. I'm running towards something. So don't think I'm running away! Oh yeah? That's so like you to say something like that. But it makes sense. Whatever the direction, from my point of view... ...you on the run just doesn't seem like you at all. It's bitter. - Hello? Huh? Mr. Tokugawa? - It's for me. Actually, Tadokoro contacted us directly. He said he'd open his place to us, and to come if we're in trouble. We don't know when the cops will search that woman's place... ...so I thought we might take Tadokoro up on that offer. Idiot! Tadokoro doesn't live in our world. He doesn't know what he's getting into! Okay... but... okay... I understand. It's just that it'll be dangerous to stay there any longer... 4 am, on the dot, okay. Anything else? Yeah, Hayakawa's boss, Gouto Ryuzo... Contact him through Yonehara from the 4th Minzoku Doshi Group... ...and get 100 million yen. Yeah, threaten him, whatever it takes. Yeah, if he doesn't move quickly we'll kill him. Tell Yonehara if it goes well 50 million will come his way. This isn't interesting if we're just running the whole time. Yeah, don't let me down. I... want to have... your child. Are you thinking about Keishi again? I know he's dead. But you're not afraid to be with me. I... really do want to have... your child. Idiot! What are you doing? No! Hey big boy, welcome! What... what are you doing? It's fine! Why so fidgety, even though you're always making people wait yourself? I won't be back for a while. Here, buy something with this. Will you be okay? Shouldn't you wait a bit longer? Don't get caught! Alright, next deal. Bets please. Anyone else? - Alright, come on. - We have a game. Hey there! - I'd like to play - Well, that's... I thought a place like this would actually be pretty safe. No way... but whatever! You bastard! Where the hell were you! I've got something to tell you about Tadokoro. That's no excuse! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Tadokoro! That's enough. I refused like you told me to, boss... ...but he insisted on coming to see you. I'm sorry. Why are you so stand-offish, refusing like that? I won't talk or anything. Come take a load off at mine for a bit. - Welcome! - That's my wife, Kayo. I'm Tadokoro's wife. I've heard many rumors about you from my husband. I'm Ando. Please make yourself at home. We don't have children... ...so behave as you like. If you'd like a change of clothes, you can borrow some from my husband. Thank you. Here you go. Please Ando, hang in there. Nobody thinks you did anything wrong. Please, make yourself at home. Hey, Tadokoro... Why are you doing this? Taking me in like this? Ando, lots of people are saying that the postwar period is over. But for people like us, the postwar period will continue until we die. Right? You remember the human depth charge training? Putting on the oxygen canister and the steel helmet. Waiting at the bottom of the ocean for one or two hours. It was the middle of summer, but we were freezing down there... ...waiting for our next orders. Breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth. That guy Konishi got the breathing wrong and died from gas poisoning. Just as my division was ordered into the sea... ...his diving helmet... ...was bobbing... ...up and down in the water like some kind of sea monster.. It was such a draining day. The guy next to me, his oxygen tank exploded and killed him. His face was all burned, bright red and all swollen. They pulled him up with such sad looks on their faces. That really was a tragedy. You couldn't even recognize what his face had looked like before. Ando... This country hasn't changed a bit since those days. Don't get caught! It's not like that. Huh? That's not how I see things... I just... Shindo! - Wait! - After him! You'll never get away! "Besieged in a Flophouse in Kofu" "Ando Group Members 'Shindo' and 'Funabashi' Arrested" - Are you Ayako Todai? - Yes. I'm Tadokoro, a friend of Ando's. Get in. Hurry! Ando, you have a guest. Ayako. I thought you'd be pretty lonely all on your own. Better to have some company. Oh yeah, I'm taking my wife golfing for two or three days. - Take care of the house. - Got it. Thank you. You've lost a little weight, no? What have you been doing? Huh? You're writing letters? While in hiding I've heard people talk about banishing violence. Where would you banish it to? Have you thought of those who you would banish... ...without allowing them so much as a nest? What about the youth of Japan, those who have no dreams, no hopes... ...and who live in such a dark state of mind? I assert that violence is an anger that stagnates in the hearts... ...of not just those who are labeled as gangsters, but all youth. All youth, including us, are the ones who will inherit the future of Japan. Put another way, is this not simply our generation? To Reporter Mori, Social Division, Mainichi Newspaper, Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Toyko. You've been bored, haven't you? Where are you gonna run to? How should I know? - What, you want to come with me to the end? - Sure. If you're headed to the gates of hell, I guess I'll send you off. It must have been inconvenient for you to suddenly be picked up and brought here. Of couse it was, super-inconvenient! But I'm the one who loves you most! You dummy, saying silly things like that. But how was it, being followed around by the police all the time because of me? Under their terrible gaze... ...it felt like you were getting further and further away from me. Hoshino! Wait! Stop! You bastard! Hoshino has been confined in the Shibya Police station. He has completely denied the charges against him... ...and will not say anything about the whereabouts of the Ando gang. He will be sent to the prosecutor tomorrow morning. He has stated that since the warrant for his arrest was issued... ...on the 15th of last month, he has had no contact whatsoever... ...with anyone from the Ando gang. Turn it off. Next, on the 5th the Prime Minister... Off! Like white blood cells killing bacteria... Running around and cleaning everything up. You may be captured and beat up with blood all over you like everybody else. Even though they're all infected and sick, the police don't let up at all. They never let up. Hey, Ayako... I wonder why I'm the only one whose lungs didn't go to hell. Should I dance for you? I suddenly wanted to dance for you, it's been such a long time. Ayako, what will you do if I'm caught? You won't! It might even be tomorrow. No! This is the last time. No! Absolutely not! No! "If caught, bring him to me." - Is this the Tokugawa residence? - It's me. This is Koyama. I've found the next safe house. A vacation rental in Hayama. I'd like to come pick you up now, is that alright? Yeah, come soon. It's time to leave this place. Understood. Ayako, Ayako! "Noboru Ando's Reasoning" These fuckers are such America-freaks it's absurd. We'll be set for quite a while here! Next we're flying to Hong Kong, boss. Tomorrow we'll hear from Tachibana. Koyama, why are you so serious about helping me escape? 'Cause... 'cause that's your order, boss. It's not 'cause you're afraid to disobey me? Boss! Is that what you think of me?! We have you completely surrounded! Drop your weapon and come out immediately! Do not try to resist! We have you completely surrounded! Drop your weapon and come out immediately! Do not try to resist! - Watch out! - I brought a souvenir for you! God dammit! Goddamn... We have you completely surrounded! - Drop your weapon and come out immediately!- Noisy bastards! Do not try to resist! - The Tsukiji Police station had decided to shift the focus...- Boss! ...of its investigation into the shooter away from Kawahara... ...and towards Funabashi, who had been arrested the other day. Nonetheless, the self-explosion of the suspect in Hokkaido... ...cannot be taken without surprise. Futher, the Metropolitan Police have arrested Ando's war-buddy Tadokoro Yuji... ...and his wife, as well as Ayako Todai under suspicion of sheltering Ando. These suspects are under intense investigation and the police firmly believe... ...that Ando's arrest is now only a matter of time. This has been the news of the Kyokuto Sentaku incident. Bastards... I'll split their heads for their brains to dry in the sun! Boss, about Tachibana... He said he'd pay 30 million and not one yen more. What'll we do? The bastard's cutting 70 million yen! 30 million... Koyama, that's the price of my life right now. You think it's expensive? Or cheap? It's too cheap! Unbelievably cheap! - Alright, refuse him. Yes! I'll insist on 100 million! No, I don't need the money. I'm not gonna go to Hong Kong. There were six of us on the run. I'd convinced myself it was just me. Now there's only two left. No, six. We were six bacteria from the beginning. Bacteria called hooligans. Bacteria, huh? That's for sure! That's the thing about bacteria... The more their friends are killed, the worse they become. It's like... ....they soak up the vitality of the dead ones. As for me, Koyama... If I'm a bacteria, I want to die causing a disease so painful... ...my opponent can't even stand up anymore. I'll tear their stomachs open... ...with the power of the four bacteria they've taken. A six person family suicide? - Yeah. - Alright! Alight boss! After all, we're the bacteria of Japan! We're the worst of them all! Yeah, nothing like that lukewarm Hong Kong beer. Let's light this town up... ...in the way that hooligans do. Shall we go out with a bang? Let's do it! Fuuuuck! Please stop, please! What the hell, is this the Japanese flag? Get them! Fuck! Boss Boss! I'll paralyze you with my disease! I'm the bacteria of Japan! Boss! I'm the bacteria of Japan! Boss! Come on! Noboru Ando, you're under arrest for attempted murder. Shut up, I'm almost there, so just wait! Don't mess with me! Wha... What are you doing? Shut up! You bastards wouldn't let me finish! Ando! Cut it out! Stop! Hey! Hey, Ando! Abdo, stop it! Stop! You're filthy! Ando! Ando! Ando, how do you feel now? Pull alongside them! How do you feel? What? Huh? I can't hear you! Say it again, Ando! Ando! I feel like I'm the emperor of Japan.
