Yeah? Eleven-ten Orchard Street. Second floor? Okay. It's eleven-ten Orchard Street. All aboard, Doc. Get the stretcher. Come on. Hurry up! Come on, you. Hurry up. Right in here. Please. Quick. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why wait? You're the doctor, no? - No. I am the doctor. You are the doctor? Yes. What can I do for you? - What? [ Italian language ] Alright, alright. Please, sir. That is not good. She is no good. It is a woman doctor. I need a man doctor. Emergency call, wasn't it? What are you wasting time for? - Please. Please go home. My wife, she is very sick. She is going to die. I got to have a man doctor. She is going to have a baby again. Is that all? - Is that all? [ Italian language ] Hey. Take your hands off me. We got a bambino once before. The bambino die. This time, if this bambino die. I kill you. You hear? I kill you. Alright. But put that knife away before you hurt yourself. What are you waiting for? Get inside. Doctor, he is going crazy. I'm going to call a cop. Alright. But get me some water first. I got to get some water. Do you want your wife to die? You get the water. She is to stay in there. When the bambino come, okay. Where is the bathroom? - We ain't got no bathroom. The water, she is in the kitchen. Hey. If the lady doctor doesn't save the bambino .. Tony is going to kill. - She never misses. [ Crying noises ] Open the door. My wife is speaking to me. What is the matter? - My wife, she is dying. This lady doctor. She is no good. Why you don't get a man? You are just in time for the christening. Twins. - Twins? Twins. Two times. He would. And that's about all I can say to you young people. You have done a good job. You have finished your internships with clean records. And now you are ready to go out .. Professionally in your own right. I want to wish you luck. Genuinely, good luck. And to tell you that we'll miss you here. And to hope that you will do your best .. To make the medical profession proud. And you two young people. Who came in together. Worked and completed your courses together. I hope you will continue happily together. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Great, isn't it. Being on our own. You said a woman couldn't do it. A woman couldn't. But you? Well .. You are as superwoman. I don't know whether to take a bow or be insulted. Take a bow. Choose your weapon. Pull. Well, we each of a diploma, an office and a key. All we need now is a patient to pay the rent. Look out. Get him up. Are you hurt? No. But you must be hurt after a fall like that. Somewhere. - Sure. Lady, I am 'Dynamite Schultz' the heavyweight champion wrestler. Well, better luck next time. You should have left it there. Come along. I'm so glad she is not anaemic. She is going to be alright now. Thank you so much. Here, here. What do you think you are doing? Playing horses. You must have been raised in a stable. Come along, darling. I think the doctor is ready for you now. A sweet child, Mrs McGuinness. Come on. Hey, what are you trying to do to me? Listen here, poison ivy. You bust one more thing around here and nurse will give you a high temperature. Just below your Mason Dixon line. Oh yeah? Oh yeah. What is the matter? Of all the things you had to specialise in you had to pick children. Don't you and the McGuinness heir get on well together? Like lobster and ice-cream. She is a lobster. When we get his adenoids out you won't know him. I'd like to take out his adenoids. With a lawnmower. Come on, youngster. Let's have a look at them. That is all for today then, Doc. And you stay out. And those are orders. Hello. Very busy? - Have you an appointment? That is what I came in to find out. I don't suppose you professional women go in for sentiment much but .. Thanks. You know today is meant to be sort-of an anniversary. Lincoln's birthday? Washington's birthday? Alligator par week? Own-your-own-home week? You're still cold. It was ten months ago today that we hung up our own shingle. Two months more and the furniture will be paid for. Sorry you came along? With Mary and you? Don't be silly. I'd rather be here than in the hospital saying 'no' to a flock of interns. Oh. Bragging again, huh? Howdy, Doc. - Howdy, Doc. Now run along to your mother and tell her I want to see you on Friday. The same to you and many of them. What did I tell you? No sex appeal. You said it. And neither has any other woman in this man's business. Gee, I wish I had gone into the chorus with my sister. She is living on Park Avenue now. She's got a lapdog, a chinchilla coat and a chauffeur. And believe me she doesn't worry about bedpans. Maybe your sister is smart at that. What's up, Don? - Nothing much. I had five patients today. - Good. Not so good. Charity. Say, do you mind if I bust our dinner date tonight? Why? Walter Rising's daughter has invited me to dinner. You know Rising? - The big politician? I thought it might be smart to accept. Of course. I understand. How about you? We could eat at home. Sure. I wield a wicked can opener. You sure you don't mind? - Of course not. Do long, Doc. So long, Doc. I wonder how long this has been going on. What? - You. I have been going on for ages. Me too. Think of all the time we have wasted. You are so young. Well, I mean to be a doctor. - Young. Young. But .. good. What do you think? I don't seem able to think. It's after two. Doctor's orders? Doctor's orders. Can I do something for you? Do you know when Doctor Andrews is in? I've rung this bell for ten minutes. I don't know. He should be. Probably he's had a call. Perhaps I can help you? I am doctor Stevens. Doctor Stevens? A woman doctor, huh? No thanks. Glenda. Bring my keys, will you. I thought maybe .. Do you know .. is Dr Stevens in? Why, yes. Right this way. In here please. Won't you sit down. Now, what can I do for you? I am Dr Stevens. You? You are Dr Stevens? Well then .. I'll be back. Thanks. Later perhaps. Another customer scared of a woman doctor. I wonder what ailed him. I'll give you two guesses. Give me those keys. I want to see what the boyfriend is doing. Okay. I hope I am disturbing you. What time is it? Eleven-thirty. You look like you've had one of those nights. Oh, I am still groggy. I'll tell you all about it. That's right. You go right ahead and tell mother everything. My, what big orders you give. I don't have to. I know. He went dancing. Then she cuddled up close to you .. And told you what a great big strong handsome man you were. How did you know? - My men are everywhere. Well, go on. You mean, there is more? You don't want a roadmap, do you? No. I rather guess I don't. Well, I just came to tell you it is a lovely day. Yeah? Well, you can have all of it. Say. What has got into you lately? Well. I don't know, Mary. I guess it is our punk little offices. The neighborhood. The patients we get. Yeah, and darned few of those. I'm just getting sick of it, I guess. - Now listen, Don. We've been together ever since we were kids, haven't we. Gone through school, college and medical school. Why, sure. Then why not come straight out and tell me what you've tried so hard not to say. Well. You know, I could get out of all this if I wanted. Lois Rising? Hmm. Her old man is a big political boss and he could finagle me a swell job, Mary. On the city Medical Board. Why, there is no telling how far I could go if .. If you were his son-in-law? Well, some people work for a career. And some people marry one. It isn't that I just marry Lois for a career. Why, she's a swell girl. She is feminine and soft and I am crazy about her. Hmm. I understand. [ Door knocks ] Hey, Mary. You have got to go right over to Mrs Pratt's. She just phoned and she's in a panic. - What's the matter? Sammy swallowed his old man's watch. - How does she know? He is still ticking. Well, that is one way to hang a wife. Is she really as pretty as all that? Pictures don't lie, do they? - No. But some photographers do. Why not put some pictures of your wife around? I was thinking of that. It's a beautiful office. No more beautiful than yours. Don't be funny. - I'm not funny. Come here. I've something to show you. What do you mean? This way, ladies. The rent is paid 3 months in advance and it's all yours. I don't understand. It's very simple. Whither I go, thou goeth. Or words to that effect. Don. I could kiss you for this. - Don't forget I'm a married man. Yeah. You would remind her of that. Telephone, Dr Lloyd. What is your name? - Franks. Out to lunch, Miss Logan. Be back about 2:30. A couple of people to see you. - Will you ask them to wait please. Refer this gentleman to Dr Griffin. I'm sorry. Hello Glenda. - Hi, Doc. How is the compensation racket today? - Never better. How is the baby racket? Still a favorite indoor sport. Is Mary in? No. She's out on a case. - I haven't seen her in almost a week. She's too busy for her own good. Yeah. We work in here. We're not on the city payroll. Ah, right on the button. Well, see you later, slave. Dr Stevens' office. No. The doctor isn't in. Well, then Miss Carroll, perhaps you could tell me .. Is it alright for my little boy to have a banana? Has he had it? Yes. Yes, he has. Then it is. Morning, Captain. Good morning, Dr Andrews. And I have been waiting here a half hour to give the owner of this car a ticket. I had that new parking sign put there just to save room for myself. Hey, Mary. Hello, Don. Say, is this ..? - Yes, sir. It's all mine. A Duesenberg. - Come on, Doc. We're going places. I got it this morning. I must try it out. I must be back at the office at 2 o'clock. Get in. Forget it. We'll be back in time. Hey. Can't you read? Right you are. A compensation doctor on $6,000 a year driving an $18,000 dollar car. Where do you get your money, Don? Now, that's a swell question to ask the son-in-law of a big-shot politician. That is what I thought. A nice day. Rising's private stock. No thanks. I never thought you'd go in for anything crooked. What's crooked about it? It's just means overcharging the city a bit on the compensation cases we handle. If I wasn't doing it somebody else would. And it might as well be me. You never used to drink until sundown. It's a cloudy day. You know Don, you've changed in the last six months. Certainly. I used to walk. Now I drive a Duesenberg. Where are we going? To a swell little roadhouse for lunch. Does anybody in your office know where Dr Andrews went? He is operating on a charity case at the Polyclinic in half an hour. "We've not seen him since early morning. Do you know where he went to lunch?" No. He said he'd be back at 2:30 sharp. I wish you'd get in touch with him. Tell me. How is Lois? I haven't even seen her in weeks. So it's that way with you two, huh? Yep. It could be worse but I don't know how. You know, that's your fourth drink since lunch. Oh. A certified public accountant, eh? Don, you're drinking too much. There isn't that much. Look at the way your hand is shaking. You don't have to have a steady hand to be a politician's son-in-law. No. But you do to be a surgeon. Wow. - What? I almost forgot. I've got to operate in half an hour. So phone and get somebody else do it for you. A simple laparotomy. I could do it blindfold. Come on, let's go. Waiter, check. I wouldn't let you bandage a finger the way you are now. The drive back to town will straighten me out. It's a simple laparotomy. Anyway, I'm going back to the hospital with you. Sure you can. Come on. Pull up a chair and learn something. Good afternoon, Dr Stevens. - Everything ready? Yes. But this is Dr Andrews' case. - I know that. I'm assisting him. And a very able assistant, says I. As steady as die. The patient is prepared, Dr Andrews. All aboard. Let's go. I am assisting him. The patient is failing, doctor. I am getting dizzy. I'll take it. Oxygen. Okay? Okay. Thanks, Mary. I'm sorry. Honest. I was just feeling a little low. That's why I drank so much I guess. I suppose you're going to lecture me. - And you will listen and like it. I may listen, but I won't .. Don, you're just throwing away a career. Do you understand that? Who wants a career? The less I do the more money I make. I'm not talking about money. I'm talking about you. Your self-respect. Your professional standing. You're at the head of the premier medical department in this country. Even if it is run by a lot of dirty politicians. You were getting somewhere but you're tossing it away. I'm disgusted with you. I like what I'm doing, see. I'm fed up with the career talk anyway. What did it get Barnet at the institute? Nothing but a swell rep' .. And not enough dough in the bank to bury him after he'd worked himself to death. You can be famous for us both. What happens when a new political party takes over? By that time I'll have half a million tucked away in my safe deposit vault. If that's all you want then I am getting out. When I saw you weeks ago we planned for all our lives. You, a doctor. You, a benefactor to mankind. I'll tell you what you are. You're a cheap politician. I am through. Fed up. - I'm not holding you. As a matter of fact I'm getting pretty sick of your preaching. You are right. Nothing is guaranteed to break up friendship like giving advice. I'll never bother you with it again. Dr Andrews. I thought I might find you here. Hello, Doctor. I have something to say to you and I hope you won't be offended. Because there is certainly no offence intended. Well? We all realise what a valuable adjunct you are to the hospital staff. And we are fully aware of your father-in-law's power in the city. But Dr Andrews I have to tell you that a hospital's reputation can be ruined .. By a surgeon who shows up drunk to perform an operation. Is that what you are trying to say? - Precisely. Your private life is no affair of mine. But as Superintendent of this hospital. It's my duty to warn you .. That you will be forced to resign from the staff if you ever .. It won't happen again. I sincerely hope not. Alright. Alright. I apologise. I said I wouldn't do it again. Alright, Dr Andrews. I'm sorry madam but you can see Dr Stevens only by appointment. She is at the clinic all morning and is generally very busy in the afternoon. Let's see. At three next Wednesday? That will be fine. Thank you. That is just what I told her but she wouldn't take no for an answer. You probably haven't had enough practice saying no. Let's see. Who is next? I think you are next, Mrs Slocum. - Thank you. Not so bad for a year and a half, huh? - I'll say not. I'll bet women have babies .. So they can boast they bring them to the famous Dr Stevens. Well, that's one reason. You know about that, huh? Mrs Nussbaum, I am sure that Sanford's nerves are going to be alright. Oh, doctor, I hope so. Only twelve years old and all he does is worry. Perhaps the depression. You think not. That's all we hear at home. How bad business is. Papa says we should give the country back to the Indians. You see? Keep giving him the phosphates and then the future may look brighter to him. We'll drop in again next week. Goodnight, Doctor. - Goodnight. Sanford, say goodnight. What's good about it? Papa says all the banks are going to close again. You see? Goodnight. Goodnight. Don't tell me there's any more of them. Nope. Mrs Nussbaum closed the show for today. I just locked up. I am ready to drop. - You look it. Here. Read the dirt and relax. I'll make you a cup of tea. Thanks. Well, I see that father-in-law Rising gone up to the capital. Poor old Don was made chief surgeon or something to the state. That ex-boyfriend of yours has been growing up too fast. Let's hope he doesn't come down the same way. What will you do with that when you get it all filled? I don't know. It's so interesting to watch a person's progress through the newspapers. I'll still take an interest. How long do you think you will keep this up? This? No. I mean this work. The clinic all morning. The office all afternoon. Hospital half the night. All day, every day. Work, work, work. Now you are somebody. Now you're what you wanted to be. When are you going to start thinking you are number one for a change? I guess that is all I do think about. You poor kid. You are all worked out. It isn't that. I just .. - I know. I have always known. Listen. Someday that nitwit will come to his senses. You'll see if he doesn't. I miss him more than I did a year ago. I can't stand it much longer, Glenda. I think I will call him up. - You will not. Gosh, Mary. Haven't you got any pride at all? Not where he is concerned. Say, listen. You're going to shut up shop and go away for a rest somewhere. And you are going to do it right now before you start playing with blocks. Why not tell them I have gone out of town to rest up? Too much work and all that. That's as good as anything. I wish I'd never got mixed up in this. Sure. Everybody does when they get caught. Want me to tell your father-in-law anything? Well. Tell him where I am. That he can count on me. I will stay away until he sends for me. That's all. Okay. And don't worry too much. Car 127? - Right here. I'll be right there. I wish you were coming with me. It will be a nice change not to see my face for a few weeks. Don't be silly. I'll probably be screaming for you by tomorrow. All aboard. I guess that means me. This is a pleasure jaunt. Remember that, will you. I will, darling. Bye-bye. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Am I the only one? Yes, ma'am. It is pretty dull round here these days. We don't expect one more guest on this train. Really? - Yes, ma'am. Why, Mary. Don. You mean to say you were on that train? - However did I not see you? Gosh, but I am glad to see you. It's been a long time. - Too long. Over a year. - It hasn't been? It doesn't seem possible. Are you down on here on business or pleasure? Running away from things. - Me too. Nothing serious I hope, Dr Andrews. Nothing that can't be fixed, Dr Stevens. That sounds like politics. - It is. Remember our last ride? Surely this doesn't remind you of it? - No. But you do. Oh Lord, how I have missed you. Did you miss me? I've managed to survive. - You really haven't missed me? I've been busy. What a grand time we are going to have together. How long are you staying? A couple of weeks. - Oh, that's great. Happy? - Hmm. Let's go outside. Why? Look at you. You know, you are beautiful. Thank you, sir. Somehow I just can't quite figure it out. What? - You. You are beautiful. You seem so surprised. Something has happened. You have changed. You sure it isn't the moonlight? The gown? It's you. I haven't changed. Then I must have. Let's cut golf tomorrow. And drive over to the pines. What do you say? Why not? I am leaving in the morning. Oh, you are joking. No I'm not. But why? You said you were .. - Don. I am not going to lie to you any longer. I am in love with you. I always have been. No, no. Wait. Do you know why I am here? I couldn't stand not seeing you any longer so I .. I ran away. Mary dear. It was all so hopeless. - But it is not. Have you forgotten you're married? - That's all over. Lois and I don't care for each other. We both know it. You are married just the same. I am afraid that is that. Darling. I love you. I guess I have just found it out. And now that I have .. I simply couldn't live without you. No. No. You belong to Lois. And I am getting out before we do something both of us will regret. Hello. Long distance? I want to talk to Dr Mary Stevens. Green Brier Hotel, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The early edition of The Times, eh? Yes. The grand Jury returned an indictment against Don tonight. They have issued a warrant for his arrest. Alright, Glenda. Thanks for letting me know. [ Door knocks ] Don. Shut that door. Lock it. I thought you were going back to .. - I had a telephone call from New York. Oh, I .. I thought you hadn't heard about it. The secret investigation has been on a month now. But Rising was positive he could fix it. Things were so hot I had to get out of town. That's why I'm here. Now what? There is still a slim chance of Rising squashing the indictment. And if he can't? It looks like I go out of circulation for about five years. Dearest. If there is anything in the world that I can do for you .. There is. Stay here with me. It is tough being alone now. [ Door knocks ] Want me to go? No. I will. A telegram for Dr Andrews. Thank you. Well? Darling, what is it? Why .. I am so happy. - Sweet. Now it's easy. Everything we said last night. Marriage, and all we hoped for. I resign my appointment. Get a divorce. I will be free. - Darling. I'll never be free again as long as I live. Right. You start taking orders now. Come on. We are going back to town. This is no time to quit. - It's as good a time as any. Only yesterday we were lucky enough to squash an indictment against you. I ain't going to let you quit now. You want to tell the world that you're guilty? Scared? You want to get the party in a jam all over again? No, no, my boy. You ain't going to walk out on us for a while. How long before you'll accept my resignation? Well, if you still feel the same way about it in a couple of months .. And things have blown over we might listen to you. Suppose I defy you? Go right out and publicly resign today? The minute you do that you'll make your d?but in Sing Sing. A threat, huh? - No. A promise. And I will give it to you in writing. Smoke? Here is one thing you can't stop. I am going to get a divorce. Well, that is between you and Lois. I'm not trying to interfere with your home life. I'm not interested in your private affairs. We can discuss the other matter next month? Sure. A drink? - No thanks. "Yes?" Get my daughter down here right away. Darling, it's all arranged. Lois wants to be free too. She is going to Reno right away. In a few weeks it will all be over. Don, we're so lucky it scares me. I'm not scared. Just happy because I know we will be together from now on. Nah. No? No we're not, dear. - What do you mean? We won't see each other again until you're free. But Mary .. - Do we have the right to be together? Now darling, listen. - But Mary .. Dearest, now wait. Please. We have a whole lifetime of happiness at stake. Why jeopardise it all just for four or five weeks? I keep telling you. Lois doesn't care what I do. It is no use arguing. My mind is made up. When everything is arranged. You call me. I'll be waiting. Where shall we go on our honeymoon? White Sulphur Springs. The Green Brier Hotel. Suite 614. But I want a divorce more than he does. Don and I have discussed it quite calmly and we have decided .. That we just don't pull together in double harness. I'll go to Reno for a month and it's all over. 'All over' is right. All over every front page in town. Played up from the political angle. A rehash of the medical bureau scandal. With me up there for them to throw mud at again. Oh, Dad. Be reasonable. Don is in love with somebody else. And so am I. - It ain't a bit important. From now on Don, you, and yours truly have got to keep out of the newspapers. Now, you get this straight. I ain't arguing with you. I am telling you. There won't be no divorce. But how can I hold a man who wants to divorce me? Ah, you can find a way. For instance? I don't know. That's your department. But no divorce. Alright, darling. Dinner at seven. Steak and baked potatoes. It shall be done, oh Lord and master. See you then. Goodbye, darling. Gee, that's the first time the boyfriend has come up for air in a long time. Six weeks. Forty-two days. Over a thousand hours and I've counted every one of them. Like a little inside information? - I'd rub it in my hair. Well. Remember that Don and I agreed not to see each other until he was free? He wasn't even to phone me. - Yes. Go on. He is coming to dinner tonight. So, my dear Watson. We deduce that he has lost his ball and chain? Something like that. He wouldn't tell me over the phone. But .. I think it's all set for us to be married. Gee, Mary. That's swell. Now. Take a good grip on that desk. Plant your feet firmly. And prepare for the shock of your life. - What? I am going to have a baby. Would you mind saying that again slowly? A pleasure. I said I am going to have a baby. I guess I'd better sit down before I fall down. What is so funny about it? I didn't invent the idea. Women have had babies for a long while. Yeah, I know. But I .. Well, I just never suspected you. I don't know whether that is a sincere compliment. Or a dirty dig. Does .. does anybody else know? Not a soul. Just we two. And you are happy about it? Walking on air. Well then, darling. So am I. Thanks, Glenda. As long as everything is all settled .. Why don't you tell Don? Of course it is his .. - Of course, you goose. He gets the good news tonight. - Yes. If he thinks it is good news. Dinner was delicious, Alice. - Glad you enjoyed it. But Dr Andrews didn't eat very much. The food was fine, Alice. - Thank you. Excuse me, mister. Could you give a fellow a light? Oh, I am sorry. What's the matter with you tonight, Don? I guess I am the skeleton of the feast. Mary, I've got to tell you. I am in Dutch. You tried to resign again and the father-in-law said no? I wish that was all. It is really serious. I dropped in this afternoon to see Lois to find out why she hadn't gone to Reno. I was wondering about that. Why hasn't she gone? - She isn't going. She isn't going? Lois is .. Is going to have a baby. Naturally, she doesn't want to divorce me now. I can understand her attitude perfectly. So can I. It's rotten luck. But all it means for us is a postponement. Instead of getting married right away we do it next year. After the baby is a couple months old I know Lois will give me a divorce. You and I love each other and always will. We are young. What difference can a year or so make? A year or so? No difference at all. Mary. You are still a champion. Just a little girl who always understands. You may be kidding but I'm not. That's what you have always been. That is one of the million reasons why I love you. Now that I have told you the bad news. What was the good news you had for me? Pardon? - Don't you remember? You told me before dinner you had some good news for me. Oh, I have forgotten. It didn't amount to much anyway. But darling, there will be a terrible scandal. 'Eminent baby specialist goes abroad'. 'Returns with offspring without benefit of clergy'. What scandal? I have my baby adopted over there and simply return with an adopted child. Oh, you have got me talking to myself. Listen, Glenda. Yesterday, a youngster came in here begging me to help her. I advised her to be a good sport and go through with the thing. Now, I'll live up to my own advice. Alright, girl scout. But what about your practice here while we tour Europe? It is all arranged for. Dr Burton will hold the fort while we are away. Uhuh. And what excuse to give your cash customers for leaving? Well, I am tired. Overworked. I need a vacation. Maybe I am ill. Well, I'm glad what ails you isn't catching. Send this radiogram for me please. Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. Attendez. Hurry up, Doc. Vite, vite. We are ahead of schedule. Calmez vous, calmez vous. [ French language ] Alright, alright. Step on it. I'll give you my phone number later. Look at this smile. Do you like it? Do you like it, sweetheart? Darling, I think we've had enough. Don't you think so? You want some more? Some more? Now then, young man. You are going to go right to sleep. Goodnight, darling. Transatlantic operator 14 speaking. New York calling Paris. Elys?e 7-5-7-8. Hello? Yes. Oh. Wait just a second. Hey, Mary. - Yes? Don is phoning from New York. What? Here. I'll take the baby. Sweetness. Hello? Hello. Are you Miss Stevens? One moment please. New York is calling you. Hello New York? Your party is on the line. Go ahead, Dr Andrews. You have your party. Hello? Hello darling. Gee. It's wonderful to hear your voice. Fine. How are you? Never better. I wrote you Thursday. You should have it by tomorrow. Listen, sweetheart. I couldn't wait to cable. No. I had to call you. Remember I wrote you that Lois insisted on going to California? To have the baby there. Well. This morning she barges back into town after having been gone seven months. No baby. Nothing. I don't get it. What did she do? What? Go on. I simply can't believe it. What happened? Give me the dirt. The whole thing was a trick to keep me from getting a divorce. She wasn't going to have a baby any more than you were. No more than I was, huh? That is very interesting. Don, that won't stop her from going to Reno, will it? If you don't say what happened I'll start frothing at the mouth. That's right. She wouldn't dare stall again. You bet she won't this time. Darling. You know, it only takes six weeks to get a divorce in Nevada. Why don't you hop on a boat and come home? Ah, why not? I am crazy to see you. Don, it's just as tough on me as it is on you but .. I just can't. Another three or four months. I have got some very important business to take care of over here. Has she had her baby yet? Is it a boy or a girl? That will give her time for the divorce and .. Don't be silly. Of course I love you. Uhuh. More than ever. But he wasn't divorcing her until .. - Be quiet. A great big smile for mama. Let's get your head a little bit clean over here. Come here. What a great, big baby you are getting to be. Now it's almost all over. Come on. Wait a second. Wait a second. There's a darling. Now we get ourselves all dressed up .. And you take mother for a big, long walk, huh? Come on. Courage, Donald my boy. If these guys listen to reason you will soon belong to your own mother. Is he alright? - Sure. But is taking you so long? You must be settling the debt. They'll come to a decision in a moment. They had better. I've only got one left. Goodbye, darling. Oh, my .. Madame, I have the pleasure to inform you that we all agree. Your request to adopt the child legally .. Has been granted. Thank you. Thank you very much. Don sends his best to you. Thanks. Good connection? - He might have been in the next room. Well, what is it? What's up? Everything is all set. You are an optimist. - Why not? They accepted his resignation from the medical department last week. Well? Well. What about the wife? The final divorce papers came through yesterday. Can you imagine her telling him she's having a baby just to keep him hooked? I have a feeling Rising was behind that. Oh, your father is going to be so proud of you. Say, did you tell him about him? I was afraid the shock would be too much for him. I can just see his face when the three of us stroll down the gangplank. This is what you might call a wedding present in a big way. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Dr Stevens. There is a little girl down in the steerage and pretty sick. I'd like to have you take a look at her. What is it? Frankly, I am puzzled. That is why I would like to have you see her. Of course. Thank you. Goodbye, sweetness. Don't forget his oatmeal at ten. How can I? I get hungry around ten myself. I'll be right back. Goodbye, darling. Here. Come on. Give a good chew and get those teeth working. She's just got a bit of a stomach upset. A cold. That's it, ain't it, doctor? Ivy has always been such a strapping, healthy youngster. I am sure she will come .. - There, there. Now don't you worry. We'll be back in a moment. Come along, doctor. Meningitis, eh? - No. Infantile paralysis. And pretty well advanced. I am positive. Of course, you haven't any convalescent serum aboard? No. That's our only chance. They may be able to fly some to us in a plane. If they can't, within about 24 hours that child is .. I'll see the captain. Get her to the hospital. Isolate her. I'll be with you as soon as I can. Doctor. It ain't serious, is it, doctor? Everything is going to be alright. Shame on you. Opening the lady's purse. Oh dear, dear. Now, you mustn't be naughty. Your poor sister being so sick. Here. Come on. Doctor, what you ask is impossible. But by tomorrow .. We'll be far enough west that a plane from New York may be able to reach us. I suppose we'll just have to wait then. We will do everything humanly possible to get you that serum .. With the minimum delay. Thank you, Captain. They took my baby away from me. They're doing the best they can. I know. Here, here. Whose is this? It belongs to the lady doctor. I'll have it sent up to her. Why are you so quiet, luvvie? Ma, I feel funny. My neck hurts back here. And I am sick in my stomach. My heavens. That is how Ivy started. Help, help! There you are. Get that off right away. - Yes, sir. What is the address of College Laboratories? Yes, it is in my bag. Just a moment and I will .. Now, where did I .. I must have left it in my cabin. May I use your phone? - Surely. Dr Stevens. Yes? [ Buzzer ] Oh. You sit down here for a minute. And don't you roll off. Hello? Hello, Glenda? I have been exposed to infantile so I cannot return to the cabin. No, dear. Don't worry about me. I am alright. You will take care of Don, won't you? That is fine. Now, in my little black book you'll find the address of College Laboratories. Give it to me will you. It's in my purse. On the desk I think. Wait a minute. So, you have got it. Yeah. Here it is. 'College Laboratories'. '1754 Prospect Avenue'. 'Brooklyn'. Not New York now. Brooklyn. Okay. Don't worry about the baby. I'll do everything you can do for him. Even spoil him. Now good luck. Here, here, here. You naughty boy. You want to swallow the pen and get ink all over your panties? Shame on you. Who is a sweet baby? There you are, darling. Better take Jane's pulse. Now I think we'll be able to sleep after a little while. Close your eyes. That is a good girl. Well? If we had that serum. We're so helpless without it. I am sure by tomorrow .. - Tomorrow may be too late. I need it now. Glenda, you shouldn't come here. - Well, I had to. Mary it probably isn't anything but .. - What is it? Don? He's running a little fever. When did you take his temperature? - A few minutes ago. 103. But Mary I am sure it isn't ..? - I'll get changed and be right there. Good luck. - So long. Don't you think you'd better sleep for an hour or two? I will call you if there's any change. - No, I couldn't. Let me see the charts of the other two. Start giving Jane icepacks again. Dr Stevens. Will you talk to Mr and Mrs Simmons? They are begging to see you. Alright. I will talk to them. Baby, does it hurt? How are they, doctor? Doing nicely. Especially Ivy. - What about Jane? They're both going to be fine. We expect the serum any time now. Nothing in sight yet, sir. Radio our position again. - Aye-aye, sir. Dr Lane. Yes? Call Dr Stevens. It's Don. It's the plane, sir. The paralysis has reached the lungs. Get the oxygen tank quick. Oh .. dear god. Don't let him die. Don. Stand by. Half speed ahead. Start it, doctor. Faster. Faster. He'll die. I know it. I can't do anything to help him. Here is the serum, doctor. - Thank you. Oh, no. No. Oh, no. Don. Don. Sweetness. Look at me. Look at me. My own baby. But I couldn't save him. Give the serum .. To the other children. My baby won't need it. Just a moment. Have you a pass? Yes. Here. You are Dr Andrews? - Certainly. Doctor, they request you to go direct to the hospital when you come aboard. The hospital? Why? Miss Carroll left word. That is all I know. Steward. Take this gentleman to the hospital. Your pass, doctor. Right this way, sir. Don. Don, something awfully tough has happened. I hardly know how to tell you. Hurry up. What is it? A couple of kids in the steerage developed infantile paralysis and .. And Mary? No. Not Mary. The baby. What baby? Her baby and yours. Mine? Caught it. He died a couple of days ago. Our baby? Don, we went abroad because Mary was .. Well. Because she was going to have a baby. After Don was born, she .. - Why didn't she tell me? In all this time .. Why didn't she tell me? - What good would that have done? You were married. No chance for a divorce for at least a year you said. Oh, my .. He was a beautiful baby. Oh Don, you'd have loved him. He died two days ago? Poor Mary. Yes. Poor Mary. Miss Carroll, the ambulance is here. Alright. This way. Hello, doctor. Hello, Gus. - Doctor. How is Dr Stevens? - She's a little better, thanks. She is such a nice lady. I hope she is well soon. - So do I. Thanks, Gus. Hello Carl. Say hello to the doctor. Hello. Hello Glenda. - Hi, Don. What's doing? - The same. Only more so. Did she sleep? Not a wink. Never shut her eyes all night. Pacing back and forth, back and forth. She's worn a groove in the carpet. I told you to give her a 10-grain sleeping tablet. How am I going to get it down her? Hold her nose and shove? She simply refuses to do anything to help herself. And what's more, she's not eating. No dinner last night. A cup of black coffee and 3 cigarettes for breakfast. You try to get some sleep, Glenda. I'll stay with her for a while. Oh boy, am I weary. I could sleep from now until the last Thursday in November. Hey, listen. When you go, take her bag along with you. Why? She has some poison and sharp instruments and things. I can't watch her every minute. Don't be silly. - I am not silly. It's a million-to-one shot but let's play safe. Alright. I will take it with me. Honey, here is Don. Mary. Let me alone. I don't want to see anybody. Come on over here and sit down. Please go away. I told you. - Please. Please, dear. Now, you are going to take this and get some sleep. Here. No use arguing, Mary. You are going to do exactly as I say. Here. Glenda should have made you do this last night. Mary, listen. There is a limit to everything. We can stand only so much. You know that as well as I. What possible good can it do for you to go on this way? But if you had only seen him. If you had .. if you had ever held him in your arms. Then perhaps you would understand why I .. Darling. Darling, you have simply got to control yourself. My life stopped when my baby died. That is absurd. Mary, you have a definite duty to perform. Your work is important. Hundreds and thousands of children need your skill and your knowledge. Forget yourself. Think of them. My skill? My knowledge. A lot of good they did me. I couldn't save my own baby. I stood there watching him die. Right before my very eyes. No doctor is infallible. - What? With all my experience? What good was everything I ever did for other people? I will never practice again. Darling. I need you. Be sensible. Forget me. Sleepy? Please go away. [ Buzzer ] Where is the doctor? - Hey, what's the big idea? I want the doctor. Where is the doctor? The doctor is in there. Doctor. Doctor. Carl, my baby. He swallowed a safety pin. Please come. He's choking to death. Come quick. You got to. No. I'm not practising anymore. - But you are a baby doctor. My little boy. He is dying. Don't you hear what I say? He's dying. I can't do anything about it I say. Call another doctor. By the time another doctor arrives it will be too late. You have got to. Please come. He is turning blue. He cannot breathe. Mary, you can't back out now. You will hate yourself the rest of your life. This is your chance to come back. Where is he? Downstairs in my flat. Come on. Get my kit. It's at the office. At the office? We'll have to do without it. Come on. Hold his head down, will you. Give me a mirror. Get me a spoon. Hold it there. Quickly. This side is better. Doctor. Save him. I will do anything. Pay you anything. Save him. Turn on that lamp. Bring it closer. I can see it. I just need something to work with. Carl, my baby. Something to reach in .. There we are. I got it. And you said you couldn't do it. I was just wondering. They say medicine is a man's game. I wonder what a man would have done in a case like this. Sanford's nerves are in terrible shape again. He thinks the country is going off the gold standard. And he is worried to death. You think not? Tel-&-Tel dropped five points today. You see. The doctor will fix Sanford up. She'll have him happy and smiling even if we must use cigar coupons for money. Just a second. Dr Stevens is .. Working on a man. Oh yeah? ..w-g..
