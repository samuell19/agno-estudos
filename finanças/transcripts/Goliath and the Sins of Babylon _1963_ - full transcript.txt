MACISTE, THE WORLD'S GREATEST HERO GOLIATH and the SINS of BABYLON (USA) Poor girl. They also took my daughter, two years ago. Damned cowards! Damned! We... We are the cowards! Instead of being here watching, we should revolt. It's a mistake! What are you waiting for? I have done it, chickens! When they came to get my daughter. I was alone! Now, I have nothing else to loose. And you, only talk! Calm down, calm down. I don't want any trouble here. There are too many cowards. - Stop! - She ran away! Help! Help! Save me! - Help! - Stop! - Help! - Calm down! - Be quiet! - No! - Be quiet! - Let me go! Help! Let me go! Help! Help! No! Help! Let go the girl! - Let her go, I said! - Help! Let me go! No! Help! Two, very brave! Now, let's have some fun. Well? Eh, merchants! Where is everybody? Far away. As farthest as possible, I can assure you. If I was you, I would do the same. Without wasting any time! - Who said that? - Goliath, the defender of the weak! Haven't you understand yet that the guards will come back? So what? Better get going, otherwise they'll have a party in your honor! Run away, run away. Run away! Run away! You son of a dwarf! Look what you've done! Get ready, layabouts, There's a friend in danger. - Are you telling the truth? - And who is this friend of yours? Is he a half dude as you? Taller, but physically speaking, we're about the same. Is he, who has attacked you? Yes! He, himself! He caught us by surprise! Right, you guessed well. I am the rebel. Any Problems? Should I apologize? - Mh? - Arrest him! Now, I'll stop your will to joke! Do you think so? Is that the friend in danger? It seems to me the ones in danger, are the soldiers. But they are too many for him. - Let's go! - Ah-ah ! Hey! - What kind of trick is this? - We are friends! Stop, otherwise I pull both of you down. Great, this way we will, all be arrested! Let's chase them! What a comfortable journey! Tha's a nice ride! No, I have no desire for changing jobs. And what's more, to become a gladiator. A killing for a killing for the entertainment of others. No, it's not for me. Those men that you despise are patriot citizens. They pretend to be gladiators... only because they want to train for fighting... without arousing suspicions. A conspiracy... And you thought of me to joining you. Don't you care about the fate of your country? Your're wasting your time. Then, why did you help that girl, to run away? What a question! Because I felt sorry for her. They chased her like a beast. Poor girl! - And the others, don't move you? - What others? Are you saying you didn't know, why they were taking that girl? - No. - You don't know? - I told you, no! - Calm down! Calm down. We believe in you, Maciste. It's the gods themselves that sent you . Listen. Every year, we in Nefer should hand over to Cafaus king... twenty four girls, chosen from, among the most beautiful. Can you imagine their fate? - Slavery? - No, death! The men of Cafaus give them in sacrifice to their gods. That's terrible! And nobody stands up to them? We! But we are very few. And why doesn't our king intervene? The king of Neder was killed while fighting against Cafaus. And an unjust peace treaty... has been signed by his brother Pergaso, himself. Now, he's the one who rules. Pergaso doesn't care if his people suffer or die... as long as he continues to rule. Someone else has to risk their lives and the throne, in a war against Cafaus. And the king who died, didn't he have a daughter? - You speak about Resia? - Yes, Resia! Unfortunately, she can't ascend to the throne as long as she isn't married. It may happen that one day, things may change. But can we rely only on hope? And we won't allow it anymore... that the girls of Nefer are being sent to Cafaus! Would you like to join us? - How many are you? - We are forty one. From now on, forty two. I'm joining too! Forty three! Well, forty two and a half. As you see, also this year we fullfiled our commitment. - We are paying the tribute, Morakeb. - It couldn't be another way. Morakeb... do you think they're worth for the immortal gods of Cafaus? We have chosen the most beautiful among the girls in Nefer. Look. Damned murderer! Now you will pay for your misdeed! - No, father! Father, no! - Let me go! - I'm going to slay him like a dog! - Let him go! No! - No! - You're a murderer! Did you want to kill me? Not you! It's him, I want to kill! - I'm cursing you, Morakeb! - Shut up, you fool! - Take him away! - You and all your mad people! Your end is approaching , Morakeb! Others will try after me, and they will not fail! That man will die. He'll die in front of your eyes! No! The years go by, Pergaso. And make the memory fade. It may happen that your people begin to forget... ... the hard defeat they suffered from Cafaus. But I don't forget it, Morakeb. The Sacred Trireme from Cafaus will be here within two days. I hope there are no more incidents during the boarding of the girls. Don't worry, the people will not even notice it. We'll board them on a day when the people of Nefer... are at a meeting in the arena. Nobody misses the Spring Race. - Is it so important this race? - It is important the place. Who is able to defeat my niece Resia... has the right to marry her and to ascend to the throne. - It is risky. - It would be if my niece... had rivals in the riding of a four horse cart. It's strange... that princess Resia has no desire to rule. If she ascends to the throne... she will loose her reputation, as an invincible rider. You're a fortunate man. How beautiful you are, Chelima! Sometimes I ask myself if I desire you just because of this. - And what is your answer? - It's not just for this Chelima... Even your name pleases me. Your hands, your face! You don't know how your face looks like, at night. Come, come to see it reflected in the water! No, don't joke, Xandros. It's late, I have to go. So early? Stay a bit more. No, do you forget that I'm the first maid of Resia. I detest your princess. Moreover, do you forget that I'm also her friend. A friendship that I do not approve. What do you have against her? You don't even know her. - You never saw her. - What I heard is enough. Do you give importance to others' opinions? Besides, you're a foreigner and have been here, for a little while. How can you judge her? A woman who uses racing as a way, to choose a man... who will share his life with her, is at least... It was Pergaso who decided that Resia would marry... the one who beats her, in the four-horses-race. Why does she accept this condition? If she plays Pergaso's game... she might not be much different than that tyrant. Xandros! Furthermore, I can't stand that you live close to her. I think that one day Resia will meddle between us... In what way? I don't understand. I ask you Chelima, remember the promise you made to me. You don't need to search more about me. I'm a gladiator, and that's enough. No, you are the man I love. Come on, hurry up! Bring that basket for loading! Eh buddy! Who are you? What do you want? Hide me, I beg you. They're looking for me. The soldiers are chasing me. Why? What have you done? I have no time. I'll tell you later. - Hide me now! - No, no, no! - Hide me, hide me! - No, it's not possible. - I'll pay you good money, help me! - I can't. There, they are! You, in the ship! Have you seen a man around? Answer me! - A man? - Yes, a man! No! No, I haven't seen anyone! Go, go! Go away! - Are you saying the truth? - Yes, of course! I don't like this silence. If they don't believe me and search the ship... I'll be in trouble. Let's take a look. I don't trust this guy! - Search everywhere! - Hello, officer. - What happened? - So you haven't hidden anyone. Hidden? In what way? Ah, hidden! No, no. - No, I haven't hidden anyone. - Neverteless, I want to check. Just to be sure. Nothing in the load. What did I tell you? Nothing at all. I don't know him. I've never seen him before. I have no idea who he is. I swear, I didn't see him get in. You can't ruin a poor Phoenician merchant! Arrest him, and lock the crew in the cargo area. I don't understand: I've never seen him! Gods of the night, you're my witness that I say the truth. Put your hands down! You can't treat me like this! This is my ship! I beg you! I beg you! Don't push me! We had sworn that no more girls from Nefer... will be given in sacrifice to the gods of Cafaus This is the moment. The Sacred Trireme should not arrive in Nefer. It will not arrive. It's going to lie at the bottom of the sea. - They have to departe, Xandros. - I go with them. No! We can't take risks. You have to win the four horses race. No one among us can take your place. - But I wanted... - Go, Xandros. I wish the gods of the sea may help you. Release the anchor! Start rowing! Hurry up! Untie the sail! Spring to the top! Since we departed, you've been wasting time, with these watermelons. Can we know what are you doing? My dear friend, with this I can float. Without it, I can not. So, take care of your affairs! The Sacred Trireme! A ship at starboard! A ship at starboard! - It's a Phoenician sail - They stopped, what are they doing? Gladiators on the deck! Prepare for boarding! Tie the sail! They're coming against us. They're going to ram us! If they dare, we'll give these pirates, the lesson they deserve! Slow down the beat! Slow down the beat! Increase the beat! Everybody to the wall! Let them come close, then set them on fire. - Prepare the braziers! - Archers on the deck! Archers on the deck! Everybody ready for combat! Everybody ready for combat! I'm here too! I'm here too! - What are you doing? - I am armed, ah! For Cafaus! - The moment has arrived. - Weapons on, handy! I'm here too! Here I go! Get up, get up! Come back again. Here it is. One, two! On the toes! On the heel! On the head! Have a nice fresh sleeping. Light up the braziers! Goliath, put out the fire on our ship. Run! My ship! Here I go! My beautiful ship! I am here! The ship caught on fire! - The flames have spread! - Quickly, let's go to our ship! All rowers to paddling! Throw the boarding bridge to the sea! Let's detach! - Goodbye, Sacred Trireme. - Too bad, it was a nice ship. I'm going to hang myself. I am ruined man. All the cargo has been spoiled. My spices with all this smoke... - Don't worry. - Yes. It's easy to say. - I have nothing else left. - Don't feel down. And this. Can you hear it? This, yes! This, yes! - Only, after you leave us on shore. - Yes. And keep quiet, agreed? - Yes, yes! What's the matter, Xandros? Sometimes, I think you don't really trust me. Listen, Chelima, you're sure of my love for you, right? Yes. I am going to hurt you, and I ask your forgiveness, but it's the end for us. Perhaps, tonight is the last night we'll see each other. I have to give up on you. Someone has to sacrifice their lives. There are too many people suffering in your country, and it's not fair. I'm a foreigner, that is true, but I have to try. The competitors put for grabs in the race, their assets or their life. Life is the only asset that I have. If I lose, they will kill me. But if I win, everything will change in Nefer! I will marry Resia, and will be a king. I know that is hard but try to understand, Chelima. I'll be forced to marry someone I don't love. Resia is very beautiful... and can make you very happy, even more than me What, you don't believe me? Aren't you convinced? Once you told me that woman wanted to meddle between us. I knew that this would finish one day but it does not matter. If that's the reason we should separate... But Chelima, you're not asking me to give up? No, if a foreigner wants to help... why should I stop him? The misfortune, the pain of everything, matters much more. No, Xandros, you'll never have peace. You will regret for not having followed your feelings. But can a woman in love accept that? A woman who loves someone deeply as I love you, yes. And now? Get all down and sink the boat! Let's go, quickly! Jump, Goliath, it's your turn. Did you drink, Goliath? - Have you touched it - I touched your ancestor's souls! Are you all fine? - Yes, only a few wounded. - It went well. Let's also hope that the four horse race, will be fine. We don't need to worry about Xandros. I saw him win at Olimpia. - Why isn't Xandros here? - He's busy with a lady. In the eve of the race? Don't worry, he'll be here soon. I would not trust that. You do not know women. It's our duty to save him. Let's snatch him from the clutches of that old harpy. Let's go Maciste, give me a hand. I know where to find him! You're the boss! Now I have to go. Stop, we have arrived! What's happening up there? I go under, I'm all wet already. Doesn't make any diference! This is becoming ugly. Come, come. Good fish, come, come, come. Caught! Why did you want to kill him? Answer! I don't know anything! I don't know! Who are you? Come on, speak! I'm a stableman of Resia. - Was her who sent you here? - I don't know! - Are you wounded? - No, it's nothing. It's just a scratch. None of the patrol boats have seen the Sacred Trireme. The boat that has been sent to meet it, has come without news. Inform me only, when you know something. Go! Wait! - Is there any storm? - No. Now, Pergaso, how do you explain this delay? I don't know what happened. - And the attempt on me the other day? - A fanatic. And the turmoil that is being generated? My informants have told me that something is going on. As soon as you find out something let me know. For your own good I hope they'll bring me good news... otherwise, I remind you that the defeat you suffered before is so light... compared to the one that you will suffer this time. Be careful, it's a dangerous game! Be careful, Pergaso! There will be no stone standing, in Nefer! And those who survive death... will be taken to Cafaus in chains! How dare you speak this way, Morakeb? You're speaking to a king. In this room where my father has ruled,... ... I forbid you to talk in this tone. You're too proud, Princess Resia,... and that doesn't please me. I'm sure nobody will beat you... in the four-hourse race. I can see King Pergaso ruling for a long time. You can be sure, Morakeb. The day someone beats me, will be, when I let it happen. Pergaso, I need to talk to you. with Morakeb's permission, of course. Pergaso! Remember what I told you. He is a giant! Who beat all of us! I had warned you! Either Xandros life or yours! Xandros has been wounded. You should have killed him! Take him away! Him no! Get out. I grant you life because you serve me. Keep an eye on Resia, as you have done so far. Thank you, my king. This is simply absurd, Pergaso. How can Resia be in love with a miserable? This miserable is going to ride a charriot tomorrow. If Resia is thinking of letting Xandros win... the gods might have brainwashed her. Or her heart. It's easy to confuse the heart of a woman. Are you afraid, Pergaso? If I wasn't you wouldn't be rejoycing. As long as I remain in power my kingdom will be friend of Cafaus. It's not the race that I'm worried about. Why haven't the Sacred Trireme arrived yet? - It will arrive, trust us. - I hope so, for your own good! Xandros will not come, He's not willing to risk his life. Are you sure? That's a mistake, Xandros. I would be a fool in letting you ride, in your state. - I can do it! - I said, no! There's one rider missing. Yes, someone called Xandros. He is very good. Should we let these people wait any longer? It's not Xandros. - Who's riding his charriot? - I don't know him. - Who are you? - My name is Maciste. Do you know the rules? If you take Xandros place... you need to tell what you'll loose. Same as Xandros. My life! Chelima! Go! Resia's love for Xandros will be good for us. True, another reason for her to win. There goes one! There goes two! And three! It's not possible! You won, Maciste. You'll be my husband and king of all these people. As written in the Laws of Nefer. I couldn't have a worst punishment for my pride. A castaway! A castaway! Help me! - Luckily, he's still alive. - Careful, he's wounded. - He might be a pirate. - Let's hand him over to the guards! - They'll give us a reward. - Good idea! Don't you see the dangerous of this succession? Who's this Maciste? A peasant who knows nothing about governing. However, today he's an idol in Nefer. And all the people is celebrating his victory. Acclaiming him on the roads. What they expect from him, once he takes my place? To send no more girls to Cafaus... at a cost to trigger another war. This way Cafaus will destroy us! Pergaso, if the people is ready to face the consequences,... - if that's their will... - What matters the will of the people? Only the goverment thinks for them. That's right. And we, with some wisdom,... will prevent a mad man to drag Nefer to ruins. But, you should be careful as per, to get rid of Maciste. The situation is getting hot. It would not be wise to break the law. And if Maciste is the one that broke it? That man is a rebel, and I'm glad to prove it. Listen to me. I apologize. I was upset, at the arrival, humiliated. I understand, this just proves that I'm not the man for you. Why is this now? I know. You're a gladiator from Evandro, like Xandros. And are part of the same conspiracy. What conspiracy? What are you talking about? Don't be afraid, you can trust on me. You want Nefer to have a king that listen to the people. I know everything. - That's why you tried to kill Xandros? - Me? Why, what happened to him? We rescued him in time from being murdered. How dare, you think that I... It was not me, I swear! I love him. I love Xandros You... You don't believe me, right? Tell him only this name: Chelima. He will understand. Also, that I want to see him. He knows where to find me. Pergaso awaits for you in the Senate. Your victory allows you to intervene... in the worst crisis that this state is facing. - It's at stake the salvation of Nefer. - I know! Thus, we want to denounce... ... the perpetrator of a monstruous crime. A deed that threatens the commitment... ... of friendship between Nefer and Cafaus. Which we need to keep at any cost, for the interest of everybody. This friendship represents a stable life for Nefer! A friendship made of blood and fear... that our people is forced to undergo,... which today, is pushed away with all its strength! So, is this the reason that you and your accomplices... have sunk the Sacred Trireme? How can you accuse me, Meneos? As far as I know, the sea can't speak. He was the leader of those pirates. I recognise him! Morakeb, do justice! Arrest him! I want him alive! Surround him! Cowards! Only one man and you were unable to capture him! That man is the leader of a conspiracy against Cafaus. -There is no pity for him! - There is no pity for anyone. - We'll exterminate all of you. - But we're not all responsible! The gods of Cafaus cry out for revenge. And Maciste's live will not be enough to satisfie them. If you continue ruling and living,... you'll see more bloodshed! We have no more time to waste. The guards of Meneos are scouring all the city for us. Our plan has been discovered,... but all the people of Nefer is with us. They're just waiting for a sign to revolt! Morakeb will kill the woman first. So, our first priority is to save them! - How to get to the undergroung gaols? - Everything is prepared. The people will attack once we have started. Hurry up! - I saw Resia. I spoke to her. - I don't care. It wasn't her who sent those men. Believe me, she seemed sincere. Even I tought she was sincere. She is, I assure you Xandros. She loves you, and wants to see you. She mentioned a strange name, but I can't remember... - Chelima? - Yes, Chelima. The guards! The guards! The guards! I'm also here! I'm also here! I'm here. Search everywhere. Here there's nobody. Halt! Look! - Xandros! - And how should I call you? Forgive me. I wanted you to be truly in love with me,... and not for ambitions. I wanted to be sure that to save my country... you would even sacrifice your love... so that my people would have a king that would help me. Don't say anything, my love. Let's not waste the little time that we have. I have to go soon. The time has come. What? You're already leaving? It's the last time, I swear. Watch out! I don't want to loose you. Don't be afraid, I will be back. - Thank you. - You're welcome! Someone get the key! Quickly, let's get out of here! The gladiators have got into the undergrond... to free the women. The people of Nefer is revolting on the roads! They're heading to the underground! Damn it! Fight them! If these trampers join the gladiators, it's the end. - We have to stop it, at any cost! - Muster draft the Real Guard! We'll confront the people and the gladiators, and kill them all. The guards of Meneos! Let's go! Let's exterminate them! The horses! The horses! The underground is burning! The fire is going to reach the room of the wild beast! Make sure, everybody goes out! We are succeeding! Succeeding everywhere! The people are with us. They're fighting on the roads. - Let's attack the palace! - To the palace. Abandon the undergound! Morakeb... Murderer! And Resia? - Resia?! - Resia, they have her... - Maciste, now it's you, the accuser. - Not me, but this blood. You will not escape, to the justice of the people! Stop! Let them alone! I'm handing her over to you, Morakeb. - Now, my reward? - Of course, you deserve it. I saw it. They escaped. They took Princess Resia with them, as a prisoner. - They took her to Cafaus. - Are you sure? Yes, Morakeb was in charge. I hope she's still alive. I want her alive. Be strong, Xandros. They wouldn't kill her. What good would that bring them? You say that to comfort me, but I know how they feared her. She was corageous, loyal. Listen. If there's a chance to save her, even one only,... ... I promise you, we will save her. If Resia was here,... she would think about the safety of Nefer,... ... prior to her own. Nefer is safe now, because the people have recovered it. Do you forget that Cafaus... has not only a huge fleet, but also an army,... and for sure, they will attack us. And we will defend ourselves. The new army of Nefer is ready for everything. No, my friends. Our only choice for safety, is to act before them. We have to attack them first. They don't think we'll have the guts to do it. They won't expect it! Excellent idea. If we had a fleet... to take our army to Cafaus. The sea is not the only way to get to Cafaus. - There's the desert of Ghor! - The desert of Ghor? Nobody has ever dared to cross it. We are going to do it! The sand, the terrible sun, the thirst... will not be, a deterrent for our soldiers, for revenge. Our main goal will be: the destruction of Cafaus... before that its army come to destroy Nefer. And for that we have a plan. An audacious and crazy plan. If you approve of it, some of you will risk your lives. It is one... voyage towards certain death. Then, you can count on me. Ambassador of Nefer, we hope you aren't coming with lies in your heart,... Rukus, the unbeatable king of Cafaus, allows you to speak. We represent the men that today, rule Nefer. They implore your clemence and your forgiveness. No one from the rebels have survived in the undergrounds of Nefer. Order has been established. Perhaps your departure was a bit premature. What about the woman that is to be sacrified to our immortal gods? Were all killed by the furious wild beast! We were unable to avoid that. And the sinking of the Sacred Trireme! It's true, no punishment would be more severe to us... than coming with your army to Nefer! Destroy our walls, arson our houses! Destroy everything! But from death people you will not get... ... what we are willing to give you, in exchange for sparing our lives. We'll send you slaves to build a new Sacred Trireme. Other women will be sent to Cafaus, to be ofered to your gods. Wheat, a product of our land. Loyalty. Loyalty is what we want, from Nefer. Here is your very enemy! The one that is guilty! The one who commited the crime, against Cafaus! We hand him over to you. This is the best proof to show the loyalty of Nefer! He'll have an awful and atrocious death. Anyone of these ropes is fastened to a harpoon... that will fall down from any of those holes up there. Take a look. Some will not touch him. Some others will wound him. And one of them, will kill him. This is worse than physical pain. Waiting for death. He'll be fortunate if he receives the mortal blow, right away. You're going to prove, yourself? I allow you the honour. You, now. You. You try. Courage! No, not even you. Perhaps your life is pending until the last rope. You, go on! It's boring to be waiting, right? Come. Don't be afraid. You'll pay for all your crimes, but only, when Morakeb decide. Everyone has struck firmly, without hesitating. - I have watched them carefuly. - They don't seem suspicious? Their repentance seems sincere. They fear us. Nevertheles, they have to be punished. Yes, but we can lay down our conditions... without having to use force. It's true. Any action against Nefer... would require us to withdraw part of our soldiers... that we sent to spread our borders... by the conquest of Shardana and Teben. The cowardice of Nefer,... adds up to your greatness, unbeatable Rukus. Pay me! It's enough, I don't want to play anymore. Then, let's play three more times. Alright, as you wish. See? I won! Wait for this other play, and you'll see. I won again! - You are lucky. - It's not luck, it's the ability. Damn! Can't you be still? You can move your hands, but please, keep your foot still, understand? Minus two to worry! Resia! Princess Resia! I come on behalf of Xandros. Xandros?! Yes, he's here in Cafaus, We came to save you. Be tranquil, we will free you. I've seen courageous men, but nobody like him. He could have freed himself whenever he wanted. His strength has no limit. But, if he had done it, our plan would fail. Do you think we'll succeed?! We don't kown anything about Evandro, or our army. Skeletons! White skeletons is what we see in the desert of Ghor! Resia, they killed her, and the best of us, we killed him with our own hands. - What are we waiting for, now?! - Calm down, Xandros! Let's not make useless, the sacrifice of our partner. One false step can jeopardize everything. We'll act at the right time, as it was planned. And even you, will obey. I ask you why are we here doing nothing? Why are we cowards? We should die with him! Calm down, don't be rushing. There's a good chance for you all, to die. - Where did you go? - What news do you bring? I saw Princess Resia. - Is she still alive? - Yes. But let me speak. Alive and more beautiful than ever. - And our army? - Take off your paws! They have no clue that they are marching. - And Resia, where is she? - In a cell, underground the palace. I talked to her, to calm her down. I told her, we will free her from that prison... and will save her. But how, without our army? Evandro will never arrive here. He will arrive, you'll see. The army of Nefer in the heart of our territory! And why didn't our soldiers in the coast, stopped it? Why haven't they stopped them, from disembarking? Why?! They did not come by the sea, they have crossed the desert of Ghor. - It's not possible. - Even we, tought of it, impossible. When they came down on us, during the night... we did not even had time to react. It was like an earthquake. The ones that were sleeping were all killed,... The ones, running to the horses were nailed down by arrows. The ones that should have given the alarm, were not able to! They cut their throats. And you, why are you alive with your partners? Have him killed! - Where are they right now? - Only one day away, on march. Maybe less. And our army is far away. I have sent a messenger to withdraw from Shardana and Teben. They will not arrive on time. We have to stop them, with the soldiers, that guard the palace. For that riff-raff will be enough. The ambassadors of Nefer aren't in the palace, anymore! They were playing! They wanted to fool us! And you believed on them, Morakeb. There's one remaining. He will pay for everything! He escaped. Arrest that man! Are you sure this is the right way? I don't allow you to talk, you fool. - From here on, I'm in charge. - Alright, Goliath. After eighty-two steps of mine, we'll meet the Princess. Put me down, slowly. Follow me, this way. Watch out your heads. But, you're really dumb. I said " watch out your heads ". 73...........74.... 75...........76.... 77...........78.... 79...........80.... 81...........82... - Well? - Huh, eighty-two. Maciste! You're still alive! - Together again! - Move away, Maciste, I 'm passing! The guards! The guards! The guards! The guards! The guards! The guards! - Shhhh. - Yes? Warrior? Allow me?
