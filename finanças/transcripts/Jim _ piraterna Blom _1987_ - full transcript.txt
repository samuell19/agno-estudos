Never look into the camera. NårAgnes go to the kitchen, you'll ... I? -Tittai the camera. Then break cheating director and says "Do not look at the camera". Thus the camera, is not it. It may sound complicated, but we repeat, so it submits itself enough. We'll start with that. Silence. Shooting. Camera. -Går. -Clap. Start. -Bryt! So you fumble. I have never done this kind of thing before. We must have a real waitress who can show. You there! I guess I can do. No, breakout! This is not possible.

But you killed her's choice not? -What do you mean? I killed my father Because I did not press the button on the hospital. Do not say that! It was not your fault! Your father was very ill. Nobody could do anything! Do not think that way. You make me jåtteledsen. Go away! Go out of my room! Go! Hello? HaIIå, hello, hello, Jim! How are you? What plans for you? Because you're dead. Hmmm ... Death and death ... I do not know. Out of town, you could say. So you and mom will teach you handle yourselves. No. You're dead. Death is, I know. It is clear that it is, but ...

Therefore, I go around and pick sorgestenar- And drive them far into space and dumps them into a big, black hole. But if someone dies, must surely be sad? Of course you'll be sorry, it is all about somebody The door -but not have one of those black grief -As means that you can not be bothered to be nice to second- -or be glad when it's nice weather or something funnily hands. All the grief weighing on nerjorden already heavy and difficult. By the way, fårjag watch your sorrow stone? -Does it hurt? -No. As being kicked by a fly. Get to know ... It'll probably be the fourth pipe wrench. It is this and so we lift there. What cold it is! Yes, I harjust been at the North Pole and downloaded an Eskimo.
