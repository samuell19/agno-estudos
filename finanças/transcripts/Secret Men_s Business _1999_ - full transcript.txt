- Get it Dillon, get it goin'. You stop me, stop me. Slow. Ah Dillon! - Mr. Douglas Petersen? - Yeah? - Did you know an Edward E. Matthews? From James Noah. I'm sorry sir. - Ali? - Really? - Yeah, can you reschedule the press conference for tomorrow at three o'clock? - All I can do is run it by the minister I suppose. See what he says. You know I don't really think he'll like it but we can try. - Andy Greville. - Andy, it's Doug. - Oh hi Doug. - Oh Andy, look I know this is the last thing that you're gonna wanna hear after everything you've been through but somethin' bad has happened. - What is it mate? - Ed Matthews, I just found out he's dead, he's died. - Dougie no, no sorry man I was expecting another call. Yep. Jesus you're kidding. What, no, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm here, I'm here. When is it? All right, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah I'll be there. - Before it's too late listen to it. Your heart, your heart. Hello, Ian? - I got your message, I called as soon as I could. That's very sad. Didn't he have a place up in Green Point? - Yeah, that's where the service is being held. Now can you make it? - Okay, I'll see you there tomorrow. - I'll see you there. Just one more time, I think we've got this. Just a bit more on that shot. - I told Doug you can't miss the caucus meeting for some funeral. I mean the whole preselection-- - I'm not going to the meeting. I wanna be at the funeral. - Doug. How you goin' mate? - All right. Are you feelin' any better? - Yeah I'm fine man. Ian Mooney. - Andy, how you goin' mate? - Dougie. Hey, good to see ya. - Michael. Don't you actors ever wear a tie. How 'bout that traffic eh? At a funeral full of road rage, how's that? - You remember Ian Mooney? - Yeah, Ian. Yeah, g'day, you haven't changed a bit. - I don't think so. Age is catching up with me. - So, shall we? - Yeah. - Oh I'll kill Waz. - I understand some old pupils of Edward Matthews are here today. Douglas Petersen will now say a few words on behalf of those men. - "All mankind is of one author and it's one volume. "When one person dies, "one chapter is not torn out of the book "but translated into a better language." In 1986 when Ed Matthews used those words in an essay topic they meant little or nothing to us. We were schoolboys. Football, cricket, swimming, and girls. These were important to us, not the words of some long-dead poet and certainly not the man who gave them to us. But now all these years later we realize the value in having had Ed Matthews as a teacher, as a mentor, and as a friend. He changed the lives of all of us. Not suddenly and radically but gradually and substantially. His was a long term unforgettable influence. That of a true friend. And today with him in this place I'd like to quote something from the "Bible". "Greater love hath no man than this, "that he should lay down his life for the life of a friend." In a way that's what Ed Matthews did for us. That's why we should never forget him. Thank you. You okay? - Yeah. - Shan't be never Dougie be emcee at my funeral. - Pleasure to bury you Michael. - Listen, what was that extra bit about him dying for his friends? We didn't need that did we? - Had to be said Mike. - God I hate funerals. - Yeah, especially this one. - Let's go to the pub, there's gotta be one 'round here somewhere. - I'd love to I can't though, I've gotta go do the inventory. - Take Doug and I a couple of hours in the house. - You're executor? He didn't have any family? - Apparently not. - Poor bastard. - We'll come and help you Doug. What do we have to do Ian? - It's probably best if Doug and I do it. - That's a good idea, we'll have a wake. Andy and I go get the piss, can't stand all this misery. Can't. - I'll do the outside first. Hey you all right in there Doug? Yeah, there's heaps of stuff down the bottom here. - You just take your time Ian. - Dougie? So Ian, you find anything worth keeping. Where he keeps his dope? - Guys this is for the distribution of assets. - Well, as the executor of this estate I recommend that we find those assets and distribute them post-haste. - Oh not me mate, I've gotta stay clean for the voters. - You can smoke Mike, you just can't inhale. - Oh so here you go, bloody Wazzo. Place of honor on the wall but does he show up for the funeral? No. - Andy, here's one with you. Taken that night. - Geez you were good in that play. What was it called again? - "The Quality of Mercy." Those lights. - Come and have a look out here. This is perfect. - No mate, now it's perfect. - Oh hey, listen, sorry but Ed let's us use this shower. - Oh no that's fine. - Ed bloody Matthews we felt sorry for him. - Is Ed there? - No, no he's not. He's dead. We just came from the funeral. - Oh no. Can't believe it. Well, I wonder when that happened? - Thanks Ian that was smooth. - What are you talkin' about? - Some strange reason I suddenly feel like a swim. Guys? And you were wondering why I brought you here today. - Yeah, he'd have loved this place. You can imagine him here. - Well why wouldn't ya? On your marks, get so, go! Oh, what's wrong with you two? - How come we knew you were gonna do that? - Ah, it's worth a try. Always worth a try. - You're a cheat Mike, you always were. - That's a bit rough. Smack him Dougie! See you cross me and my boy'll take you to pieces. Thank you Douglas. - You're welcome. So are we gonna have this race or muck around like a pack of girls? - Yeah, not quite. - Oh that's it, I'm never leaving. - That's worth a funeral. - Almost. - Oh, kill for a beer. - Those chicks, chicks. No wonder Matthews died early, I wouldn't last a week up here. Hey Andy, those chicks come back in for another shower, the old team what do you reckon? - And what about me? - Oh come on mate, you're Mr. Married. Besides, Andy and me got I tperfected. Hey, New Year's Eve '89? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You in or what? - You're a sleaze Michael. - Hey, you're usin' my towel. You're usin' my towel, give it back. - I think I left mine down the beach. - So go get it, don't use that one. - You can have this one when I'm finished. - I'm not usin' it after you've rubbed it all over yourself! Here! Hey, hey. - Wow! - Easy. - Ian how's it going? - Ian stop please, you're making me tired. - How was it? - Beer, we're very thirsty, we need some beer. Maybe some tequila. Good idea, beer first. Come on mate, get rid of that. Go and have a drink. - Beer. - Ian, forget about it. Don't worry, we can do it later. - Here Dougie, catch. Good. - Oh Doug, there's somethin' you might wanna see. - What? - In here. I was going through the documents and stuff. Look what he had in here. - Why? Why didn't you just trash it? - What do you wanna do with it? - Burn it, burn the lot of it. - What about this? When the sound of his motor faded there were no more cars, just the quiet warm of night up and down the stretch of highway and back and down into the paddocks beyond. - My stories. - Looks like he kept the lot. You wanna burn them too? - Yeah you might as well. Ah that's such crap. - No they're good Doug. They always were. - You know I wish they were. - Thought you might wanna keep 'em. All right we'll just throw 'em out there with the other stuff. - Yeah, will do. - Dougie, hey! Where'd you go? - To Ed Matthews, best teacher we ever had. - All around good bloke. Ed Matthews. - But more than just a good bloke wasn't he? - Crash and burn is better than never tried, you remember that, remember that? - I don't think that's what Ian's talkin' about. - So while we're at it how 'bout a toast to Laurence as well. - Oh for god's sake Ian, give it a rest will ya? - A rest? Haven't spoken about it in 12 years, how much of a rest does it need. - It's not as if we don't know what happened. - What happened is Laurence was an idiot. He knew the Matties were in the punch. He should've known better having that liver condition. - Hemachromatosis Michael. - Thanks Ian, thank Christ you're here. Look the truth is it was an accident plain and simple. There's no point in going on about it is there? - To Laurence. - To Laurence. - To the memory of Laurence. - Hey Andy, how 'bout you me and Doug, we divvy up the beers, we get some pizzas, watch the sun go down in style? - And Ian. - Ian, he gets to go in a minute don't ya? He never drinks more than one anyway. - What would you know Michael? - You're a wild man Ian. So Marty gets this call for the cops, right? They found out that we're in a motel room. He's dead as a door nail and he's bare assed naked. So of course Marty asked the cops "Was there anyone with him?" and they cops say "Well, not at the actual "time of our arrival, but we can tell you that "the deceased male was wearing a prophylactic "and it was loaded." Yeah, exactly. So now we got a bail actual because the old fart wanted to get his end in. - Hey Andy, what happened to that "Henry the IV"? I read somewhere you were doing that? - Yeah I was, I was, but I didn't. - How come? - Decided not to. - Why's that? - Given up acting. - You've done what? - What do you want me to say it again Michael? - So what are you doing? - I'm doin' okay. - No hand on Andy, get real here. What are you talkin' about? - No I am real Michael, I'm not acting anymore. - Well mate that's just stupid! - Hey Michael let go, let go. - Oh come on. - No now let go of it okay. He's answered you question. Beside's Michael it's your shout. - Oh, that'll be Bec. - See ya Ian. - Right Ian. - See ya mate. - Shoes, shoes. - See ya mate. - See ya mate. - Daddy, Daddy. - Hi my gorgeous girls. Hello. - Hello. - Hi. We're just finishin' the probate list. - You smell like a brewery. - Yeah. - Okay sweetie, I better drive. Chloe's feeling a bit carsick so you'll have to hop in the back with the twins. Come, chop, chop. Everyone back in your seats. Daddy'll sit with you two. - Hang on, hang on. I said we haven't finished the probate list yet. Why don't you come in and say hello. - Look Ian, it's late already. You know tonight's been netball practice. We've already been driving all over bloody what-what trying to find this place. Let's just-- - Hey Bec. - Hey. - Hey Bec. - Come, let's go. - No. - Excuse me? - I'd like to stay. They guys, they need me to do this. - You're doing it again aren't you? - What? - Every time you're with these guys you do everything they say. - Geez Bec, you know we haven't seen each other for long time. - Yeah I wonder why that is? - Little Izzy's getting his bottom smacked. - He's all right. - No, it's not lookin' good. - No. - It's funny how the only time they ever call is when they need a favor. - Why are you so agro? - Because I hate the way you are when you're with them. - You don't know what it's like. Go home Bec, I'll get a lift with the guys. - Who with, they're not driving home? - I don't know I haven't thought about it yet! You know it might be a thrill just once in a while not to plan everything. - So when are you planning to come home? - I don't know. - Okay, that's what you wanna do. - Thanks. - You're better than them. - See her kids? - Bye. - Bye. - Drive carefully. - So, what happened? - I'm staying. Told her I wanted to hang out with you guys. - Oh I don't know mate, takin' your life in your own hands there. - Oh, well done. Oh she's all right. - She knew we were pissed. - Pissed, excuse me, pissed? Who's pissed? - We'll show 'em pissed won't we mate, 'eh? - So, what do we do now? - Oh I don't know Ian, we haven't done a flow-chart yet matey. - Andy, get some paper mate. - Make a list will ya? - I haven't played this in 10 years. - That gonna be your excuse when I wipe you out mate? - Jesus Mikey, it's always gotta be a fight, doesn't it. There always has to be a winner. - Yes mate and you better try and make it you 'cause the other bastard sure as hell's gonna try and make it him. Ask Warwick. - I would if he was here. - Okay, Matthews raises you 20. - I think that might be called cheating. - I'm helping him, I'm not cheating. - I think he's got the third ten. I should quit. - Never matey, come on! - He's doin' better than we are, up 10. - Up 10? - Not better than all of us. Life's sweet and up another 20. - Oh I'm very glad to hear that. Up another 10. - See you in call. Can't complain about my life either fellas. Life is sweet. - Yep, we're lucky boys, right? - Yeah, people always need lawyers. See that. Hey, it's not your turn, it's Andy's. - Too slow, what'd you got? - Nothin'. - Well Matthews comes through with three 10s. Oh yeah. - The old three 10s. - Okay my deal. It is seven card stud, high low, put our stakes bets. Hold on, pot's light, And? - I'm with ya? How's work Doug. - Same old, same old. Now Mr. Matthews, glass is empty, Michael. - Don't want him dyin' of thirst do we? - No we don't. - Yeah, I'll see you and call. - Yeah I'll call. And do they run that taste of Mexico out Doug. - Well thank god no one knows that taste of Mexico, that is mine I mean can you image what if Matthews would have thought of that shit? Now are there any raises? No, all right kittens, you know what to do. What do you got? - Three jacks. In tune with the cards. - He guys, come one, let's bet some real money here. Show some balls, some cajones, hey Dougie, 'cause it's a little taste of Mexico. - Enough, enough. Let's play, enough! - To me, to me! Over here. Hey, Dougie, Dougie. - Go Mikey! - Oh!

I've always been scared of beautiful women. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What's to be scared of exactly? - No I know what you mean. - Oh as if you'd be scared of women. - Not women Mike, it's beauty. - Well Ali's beautiful isn't she? - But that's Ali you know. She different, she's not like that. - They're all like that mate, they're all beautiful. You're supposed to be grateful god put them here that's all. I don't reckon it's any harder to crack it with a totally beautiful chick than anyone else. - You couldn't get them. - Well now Mister Lawyer you wanna put some money on that? Andy and I'll have those two chicks up in that house in what do you reckon, half an hour? - You're on your own mate. - What, oh come on, what are you, what? Mate?

Listen, wait 'til I get over there then kick it in my general direction, all right? What you got a better idea? - No, no. - Come on snuggles. - It's bright, the old kick it in the general direction. Pathetic isn't he? - Whoa! Oh, sorry. Michael Schofield. - Anita. - Michael Schofield. Sorry my friends just a lousy kick, that's all. Whoa. So you guys from around here or? - Holiday. - Oh yeah, yeah us too. - Snowball's chance in hell. - Oh I don't know this is the same guy that had that Rebecca what's-her-name and the Dutch chick on the same night. - But in different cars. - No, we were right. Look at him. Jail bait, they think he's their uncle. - Naughty Uncle Mikey. - Gonna be a hundred bucks, thanks. They're comin' up to the house later tonight. - They just said that to get rid of you. - Oh yeah you wish. Ho! Oi, Andy, Andy. Oi. - Andy. - What? - What's he up to, see him, see him? - Is that guy all right? - That's what we were just wondering. - Where's he gone? You see him? - No. - Oh shit, come on. - You got him? Get him started. Go, go, go up completely, go! Now gently, gently. You're all right mate, you're all right. We gotcha now. - He still breathing? - No. - Oh shit, I can't feel a pulse. - You know how to? - Yes I know how to feel. - So what does that mean, he doesn't have a pulse? - It means I can't feel one! - Maybe it's weak or something, he could be fibrillating. - Fibrillating, Christ. - Does that mean we gotta do mouth to mouth. - Well there's not point if his heart stopped is it? - I didn't say his heart stopped. - You said he has no pulse, what else does that mean exactly? - Just do something! - Do you know how to do that? - On a plastic dummy I do. - Shouldn't you be counting or something. - I am counting Michael, shut up! - Anything, anything? - Come on. - I need a minute Doug, take over. - All right, all right, I've got it, I've got it. Is he breathing, check his airway. - No. He's dead Doug. - He's cold. - Breathe. - I've never seen a dead body before. - Nor have I. - You saw Laurence. - He was in a coma. - Well in the end he died, same as this bloke. - About a third of the way down the beach. We'll wait there. Okay. - You know he was moaning when we first got out there. Which means that he died when we had a hold of him. - Doug, come on give it a rest mate, he's dead. Right? Was a man, now he's just a piece of meat, mate. - Jesus Michael. - Well. - So quick. - But not for everyone right? - No. - Wonder what his name was. - They're sending an ambulance. - It's a bit late for that now is it. - Should we say a prayer or something? - Why? - Why not? - What's it gonna mean? He's not here, he's gone. - No go on, do that. Say a prayer. Guys I'm gonna get going. - Yeah me too. - Shit. Yeah I realize that Susie but he did say he was gonna call as soon as he got out of the meeting and that was hours ago. - Oh, this looks pretty bloody good. - Yeah, get him to call me ASAP would you? Okay, appreciate it, bye. Hey what's up kitty. - Mikey. - How are ya? - Firing on all cylinders mate. You bastards, hiding out in this beautiful spot! - You promised you'd be at the funeral! - Better late than never, hey? - No, no, Waz actually we were just leaving. - Oh pigs ass you are, you can't leave now, I'm here aren't I? - It's all over now. - Oh don't be such a, ah, it's Ian, right? - That right. - Course it is, sorry mate, I can't remember my own name these days. Go, go, go this bloody business. Hey, this block must be worth a fortune, eh? Knock this heap of shit down, make some real money. How was your funeral Dougie? - It wasn't as bad as the beach mate. - What does that mean? - Later. - All right. So this is where the old bloke lived? Oh, ah it's amazing. Look, he's still got pictures from school everywhere. - Well it would've been his last job. - No, not really, I mean I spoke to him from time to time. He was working up here. - But not at a real school, not full time. - Well what did he do? - Oh just casual stuff mainly. He used to joke about tutoring some locals up here, only their third go at year 12. - You know who that'd be, that'd be those surfy chicks we saw having a shower down there. You haven't seen these girls Wazzo. - Oh look, it's the school play. What was it? - "Quality of Mercy" was it? - "Quality of Mercy". And there you are Andy, look at you. Hey you're a star made already. - We were saying before about that night. - Oh and there's the redhead with the tits. I remember walking past the assembly hall and she was up, she was doin her thing, and I just went straight in, I signed up for stage crew. - Did you get her? - No mate I would've, I would've no question if it hadn't been for all the trouble. - You know the trouble's why Matthews never taught again? - Properly, at a real school. That was the judgment. - Yeah, oh, well at least he had a top spot to live in. I mean he would've had a parade of women through here. Chick magnet this place. - Chick magnets, horny Mandys. Wasn't that one of your nicknames for Mandrax Warwick? - Here Waz, catch. - That your best throw Mikey? Well aren't you other blokes havin' one? - They're the last two mate. - We thought we were leaving. - Well you thought wrong. God that is bloody brilliant Mikey. I mean, you're gonna get it right, you're the man, right? - Yeah, yeah we'll see. - Oh bullshit, no we'll see about it mate. I mean you're gold, you always have been. Hey Dougie? Dougie, mate, that bloody the donkey with the tacos and. I dead set pissed myself every time I see that mate. - It's pure genius. - Well mate I bet it sells a shit-load of tacos. And that where the genius is, right? Tacos aren't so bad either are they? - They're terrible for you, full of all sorts of shit aren't they? - Ian, is your time of the month or something mate? Can you just lighten up, that'd be nice. Hey Andy what's this bullshit about you retiring by the way? You can't retire can you? I mean you're a star right? - No Waz I'm just gonna try my hand at something new. - Like what, you're an actor, what else are you gonna do? I mean you could sit around like a wanger on a doll all day. - No mate, not quite. No I'm, I'm gettin' married. - What? - You see that's why you piss me off Andy, you never tell us anything. I mean come on, why didn't you tell us that? - I just told you! - Congratulations. - Thank you Ian, thanks mate. - No look, well who is she, I mean I'm presuming she's a woman right? I mean you're not battin' for the other side? - No, not yet, her name's Margo. - Margo. - Margo, that's the farmer chick, is that right Doug? - She's not a farmer, she's got a property up in the Hunter. - I got the impression she was about a hundred or something. - She's 40. - Oh! - Same thing isn't it, she's 10 years older than you. Been smokin' those silly cigarettes again? - 10 years Mike, what's 10 years. It's nothing for me, it's nothing for her. I don't know what you're gettin' so fussed about. - Look can I clear this up for a second. Andy, you're giving up acting and moving off to some bloody what, a farm, to marry your mother? This isn't you Andy, you're the greatest, what's goin' on? - Wazzo she's the greatest to mate. You're gonna love her. You'll meet her at the wedding, trust me. - Fantastic idea. Look, he's getting a wife, kids, a farm. I mean Christ all he needs is a tractor and-- - And kids mate, and kids. You got geese and ducks and, must be old McDonald now or something. - No, no, no, I get it, I'm with you, I've got it. You sly old dog, hey. She loaded, right? - No, wrong. - You see Andy the thing is you can't raise another man's kids. It's against nature. You're gonna have to sell them into slavery or something. - That's pretty funny Michael, yeah. I've had a gut full okay so let's just get off it, all right? - All I'm saying is, you're famous. If you think about what you're doin' you'll find-- - Michael, do you not listen. I said I like the farm and I like Margo. Okay, it's my life and I'm not gonna pretend to be anyone else. - Oysters and Champagne. - Ah, what? - Oh god, you carry on like a bunch of bloody undertakers. The guy's getting married, aren't you, okay. So, where's the nearest town Dougie? - Five K's up the coast. - Okay, here's the plan. Andy, stay there, don't move, relax. Mikey, Doug, come on, back of my car, let's go. We're gonna come back with stuff for you. - Thanks god. - So, who invited Ian? - Good question. - Hang on, hang on. Look, he's a good bloke and besides he helped with all this Matthews stuff. - Hey listen, what's happened to Andy? I mean he was always a bit different that's what I liked about him but he was never a wanker. - Yeah I know. - So he dropped out, so what? - He hasn't dropped out, he's hiding. What's wrong with him? - Hey, do you like the car? Wait 'til we get to a hairpin, I'll show you how she holds the road. Here we go. Whoa, who's James Bond baby? Who's James Bond? - You are Waz, you are! - Hey, is that Sapphire, just up there? No, no, one on the right, is that Sapphire? Yep, good, let's have it then. - You know what it costs? - Yes, I know what it cost, it's the best and you get what you pay for don't you Michael? You wait 'til you taste my Sapphire martini mate, it will take you to another planet. - That'll fix 'em up. - Anything else? - Lads? - Is there anything left? - Well you know, we got to do it properly haven't we? Have a few drinks, tell a few lies. - Here let me get this one mate. - That's all we need, that's all we need. No, no really, my idea, my show. - Sorry the machine's broken. - Here Waz, let me give you something. - No, no, no. - Seriously, come on. - Shut up, shut up. Before he changes his mind. - We'll meet you in the car. - One, two, three, four. - But have you got anything smaller? - Smaller than this? - Haven't got any change. Guys, has anyone got anything smaller than a hundred, she need change. - Sorry mate. - Three one hundreds. - Sorry. Look at that Dougie. How do the chicks like these things mate, with this throbbing between their legs. - Like a date with you. - Almost. - Hey, hey, no, don't touch it. - What? - Donkey touch. - Oh no, it must not be touched 'cause it's so lovely. Him sir, take and shine. Who did this? - Forget it, really, it's no. - Tough bastards, aren't ya, hey? Vandalize a car when no ones lookin' then too gutless to say so when they are, is that right? - Oh that, oh I did that. - Why? - I'd piss off mate. Go take your two girly friends with ya. See we don't want wankers around here. - Wankers? We're wankers are we? What as opposed to real men like you guys sit around on your fat ass, drink up the doll and beat up your wives. Come on! Come back. - Come on Waz. - Sorry 'bout the shove mate. - You touch my car again and you're back in prison dickhead! - Yeah run, run away! - Go home you fuck turd! - I'm outta here guys! - Fuckin' assholes. - We're back. And we are victorious. - 1-0 victorious. I coulda taken 'em all on if it hadn't been for these two wuzbags. - Yeah that's right, we could've all been hospitalized. - Now, let's get amongst these oysters. Mikey, they're yours to knife and Dougie, Champagne all 'round. - Certainly. - What's goin' on with him? - I have to sort out some cheeky peasants. Now, where's the bloody knife Mikey? - Who made you king? - He earned it mate. Dougie, bring a knife would you, an opener for the oysters. Thank you now, gentlemen, I propose a toast, to us, good mates, good times, damn good time in the past, to many more in the future. - Ah, and, and. - Yes, and Andy's getting married. - Oh, you weren't here for the toast to Mr. Matthews Warwick. - All right, well, here's one to good old Mr. Matthews. And to his house. - To Mr. Matthews. - Cheers. - And of course the toast to La-- - That's the end of that one I'll grab another. - One dead soldier, so, let's face it, this my friends is the life. - Indeed, to the life. - To the life. - Reckon we've earnt these. - Nearly died getting them, bloody Waz. He'll never change. - No, then we'd hate if we did. - We would. Listen I wanted to have word with you Mikey. I had thought about maybe trying something different for this campaign. - But Doug I gotta tell ya we got a couple people workin' on it so it becomes a kind of a difficult area-- - Of course you got people working on it. And look I'm stretched thin myself but, I just keep thinking Mikey that if I could shift a couple a things around I could give you a hand with this strategy. - You wouldn't want it mate. Workin' for pollies, it's, it's a nightmare. - Look the clients I've worked with, you wanna talk to me about nightmares. No, look, I think I could really, really help. - I wouldn't do I to you Doug, you're too good a friend. - Mikey, that's why I'm asking you. I just need the buzz. I mean I love the stuff I'm working on, don't get me wrong, but I just need something that I can really believe in again, you know? Just for a change. I'm dead, I can help. I can still their work but I need to feel the blood flow again. - Mate now I don't know what I can-- - Well it's not just for me, it's for Ali as well. It would really help things. - I don't wanna get in the middle of you two. - Mate, look, you're my best friend, I can tell you this, things between Ali and I well they're, they're not crash hardened in every department if you know what I mean man. I just, if I could just-- - Hey! You bastards drinkin' all that frog piss yourselves? - Traveling. Ah, see winning is a science boys, winning is a science. - Coulda left me ya wood Doug. Ante up, it's a penny. - I don't know. Maybe it's just the Matthews. Hey if it's a pizza delivery girl bring her in. - But leave the pizza outside won't ya. Put the woman down man and give her your hot chili peppers. - Oh, look out Mikey. - Guys this is Catherine Healey, the gentleman on the beach this morning was Mr. Healey. - Would you like a seat Mrs. Healey? - No thanks, I just wanted to ask you about Pete. This morning. Well the police told me what happened and I just wanted to say thanks for all you did. I know that you did your best and I just wanted to meet you and thank you. - We're very sorry about what happened. We did what we could. - I know. - All right. - Would you like to maybe come in and sit down Mrs. Healey? Cup of tea? - I didn't really come here to thank you. Oh I did, I did. Can you tell me how it happened. - Oh yeah, we just saw him out the back and he looked pretty out of it. - Was he waving his arms, was he calling for help or anything? - He, I think he may have been, he was, his arm-- - Well he's been really depressed lately. Things at work and everything else. He'd been withdrawing into himself. But I couldn't talk to him and the kids couldn't. I kept saying please just talk to me, please. But he wouldn't. I could see there was something inside but he couldn't get it out. And then last night he said well "I'm not going back to work, ever." He never came swimming down here. It was because it was very deserted and there's the rip as well. - He was definitely trying to signal us with his waving. He was waving to us when we saw him. - Thank you. Thank you. - He topped himself. - That's bullshit, huh? - He was waving. - No he wasn't. - No he could've been. - He wasn't bloody waving Michael. - No. - No he wasn't when you think about it. - Poor bastard. - I already did it once. - What happened? - It's none of your business. Who's in? - Not me. - It was the night Laurence died. You remember that? - How we forget that? - Well, I was doin' all right, we'd just left school and I could put it all behind us I thought. - He was still in a coma though. - Yeah but I got used to that. Somehow it wasn't death. In a coma you've still got hope, right? And then when you told me Dougie, I didn't feel anything. Nothing. And then I was comin' to see you guys that night, remember? And it hit me and I drove up to Macquarie Reserve, I parked the car, I sat there. If I looked out the windscreen at the fence. And I thought all I have to do is put my foot down now and I'm straight through and I'm over. Over, easy. And it was weird because there was voice in my head tellin' me to do it. - Yeah. - I was 19 years old and everything in my life was shit. - Yeah but the difference is you didn't do it. - What are you saying Michael? - The difference between you and this guy today. - How do you commit suicide by drowning for god sake. I mean it's not Australian. - Yeah I guess you swim until you can't swim anymore. And you just keep swimming. - It's what I do every day. - Right, stay afloat 'cause that's what you gotta do. - Yeah that's profound Michael. - Look all I'm saying is it takes more courage to stick around, to not kill yourself. - No, it's the other way around mate. - What, someone takes some pills, drops off to sleep. That's supposed to be brave? That's crap. - You'd do it mate. - No I wouldn't. You can always hit the piss you know. Get on the drugs and there's plenty of ways to check out. - Yeah, there's such a things as daily suicide. Know all about that. - Geez, at least-- - What, what? - It's those guys. - What guys? - God we're dead. These are the guys that we had the fight against. - Go deal with them Waz. - I don't know what's madder. Christ it sounds like there's 200 of 'em. - There are at least five. That's five too many. Turn out the lights. - Yes, yes. - What are you guys doing? - You haven't seen these guys Andy. When they walk their knuckles drag. Like a bunch of monkeys. - Do it, do it, fuck them! - Fuck them, fuck them! - All right, we need shotguns. - Get down Doug they'll see you. - Dougie. - I'm gettin' beer. - Hey Dougie, get my beer will ya? - Yeah, mine too, would ya? - Hey, don't anybody ever tell about this, okay? - Never. It shall not be mentioned. - Not exactly behaving like men. - We're not men we're. - Poofs? - No, well yeah. - Like cowards. - Survivors. - Perhaps, we don't know that yet. - Happy birthday boys! - No. Enough. This is bullshit. - Hey. Hey I told you it'd be house full of puffys. - What do you think your doin' dickhead? - Oh you forgot your vodka. - That's not all I forgot. Well do you want your head beaten in as well as being arrested dickhead? - Yeah, yeah. - Do ya? I said do ya? - Yeah mate. - Piss off. Piss off! Wankers. - Michael. - Phoebe, hi, Emma. - Hi. - Glad you could make it. Come in. - What was all that about? - Oh, just a couple of locals droppin' by to say hello. Nothin' to worry about. - What was the crash? - Come in and I'll show ya. Owe me 50 bucks Ian. - Who owns the 9-3. - That'd be-- - Warwick. So you girls from around here? - No, not really. - So, who else is coming? - To what? - To the party, who else is coming? - Let me guess, this is it. - No a few of the others said they might drop by. A bit later. - Yeah right. - Who, your friends on the bikes? - No, no, no, they were. That was tribe of peasants we had to sort out earlier. - Really. Oh 'cause I thought that they were gonna sort you out. - Yeah, bottle through the window. - Ah, the bottle. - So, you girls up at the beach for very long? - Another week. - Not really. - A week. - Special delivery. You girls happy with martinis or would you like Stoli on ice? - Can you believe this shit? These girls are much to cool for their bullshit. - Hey mate this is Mikey and Wazzo having fun. - Ah, fun, huh? Yeah I vaguely remember that. - Yeah. - So, how come there aren't any girls here. I take it that you do like girls? - Yes, yes we do very much. Yes, we're just here for a funeral. - A funeral? - Teacher. This is his place. My wife was here earlier but. - Wife? Are you guys married? - Well he is actually, he is very married. Mr. Married. - Well how 'bout you two? - Not me, no, far from married. - And you? - I just separated. - What as in you're up here she's in the city. - Dougie, how's that food coming along mate. - Oh Michael is one thing but can you believe Wazzo, eh? - What, that he's cracking onto a girl? Have you and Warwick ever actually met Ian? - I'd like to see the look on his face if Kate walked through the door right now. - She'd have his balls. By the way, you owe me 50 bucks. - For what? - The bet. - Ah, I paid Mikey, remember. - That's bullshit, campaign contribution. Tax right-off, I'll have to get a receipt. Hey where's Andy? - Dougie have you met Emma and Phoebe? - Yes, yes I have. - And are you a hotshot like this guy? - No, not really. Yeah. - Did you see all this mate? - Yeah. - What are you gonna do with it? - I don't know. Chuck 'em out I guess. - You're good Doug, you got it. - So have you mate. - Yeah that's different. - Why is it different? Because you had it all and you walked away from it? - No, I couldn't hack it. See you don't have that problem. You still want it don't you? - Oh, sometimes. Late at nights I do. - See I don't. You know all that stuff about how great it is up in the bush and how great it is with Margo. I cracked Dougie. I had a breakdown and I'm shit-scared of having to get up there and do it again. I don't want that noise, I don't want that mess inside my head ever again. And it'll happen. Yeah I didn't just wander off to the bush mate. - No, you ran away. - Yeah, I ran away.

I haven't been made love to like that in a long time. - Oh sh... - Doug? - Ali, sh... Jesus, Ali! - Hey Dougie, you're forming a company mate. - Ali it's Michael. - Michael where is he? - Yeah he's outside. - Oh god, oh my god! - No! - Hey Mikey what's goin' on? - Leave him alone, it's my fault. - What the hell did you do? - Bastard! - Just let me explain here. - Explain what, huh? You piece shit! Piece of dirt! - Dougie, please. Dougie, Dougie. - I didn't put a gun to her head mate, she came to me, you got that. What does that say about you, huh? - Doug! Dougie. Get outside. Just get outside. Just cool down a second. - Shit! - Jesus Christ Schofield! - What's wrong with you? What were you tryin' to do just now? What were ya? Least I'm not married. - Oh thanks mate. - Of course you're allowed 'cause you're the Big Wazzer aren't ya? - You are a weak prick. - Can you just tell us what's going on? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? You're about to kill each other. - Do you mind? - You're screwing his wife. - It's really none of your business. - None of my business. You've been coming onto me all night and now it's none of my business. You're pathetic. - Emma. - And you call yourself friends! - Emma, Emma, just wait up will you please? Will just, listen to me, please? - Why? - Because it's important. It is to me at least. - What, to have a screw on your night out with the boys? To have something to brag about? - Emma, just look, give me a chance, will you? Please, it's not that at all. - Really, how would I know? I mean all you guys do is lie to each other except when sometimes you're screwing each others' wives. - No, I'm not lying now. Please believe me. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I'm sorry that that happened. He's not a friend. - He is actually. Best friend. - Do you want me go away? - No, no, no. - What are you gonna do? - All I do know is that when you walked in there tonight I looked at you and I felt something like I haven't felt since way back then. And I looked in your eyes and there was this. - Yeah. - Yeah. Wasn't it? And it felt so right. And it was easy. And it was fun. And it was hot. - I have to go. - Please, please, please don't go! I just found you. Give me a chance. - Were they flirting or anything? - They work together. - Oo. It the worst. - 'Bout six weeks ago we had a barbecue, 20 people or so. I watched her pour a glass of wine and hand it to him. - And? - I knew just then. - How? - I recognized the look? - Did you yell at her? - No. - Why not? - I didn't want to hear the truth. - You didn't yell at him either did you? - No. - Why? - 'Cause he's my best friend. - But that's how come they did it. So you just kept it a secret from yourself. You're a nice guy, you can change things. You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - See ya. - All the dumb acts you've ever pulled Schofield. - What do you do, tick women off the list? - Do you guys mind, it's really none of your business? - Are you kidding? Why don't we sit around and play cards now? Have you heard, Michael Schofield's screwing Ali. Do tell, nice weather we're having. I'll raise you five. You're a prick. - So why are you getting so upset? - You can't tell can you? - No I can't. - You behave like a seven year old and you think you're a man. Well I got news. There's more to it than that. - Please don't stand there and moralize to me, okay. Who the hell are you anyway? - Hey, Ian! - Big Mikey. Big powerful politician guy with his photo in the paper. - Ian he's not worth it. - Shut up Andy. You wanker. Oh yeah you think you're so good. Poor old Ian. Anyone know any good lawyer jokes? Now let me tell you some. I've worked my ass off for my wife and girls. I haven't cut any corners since I was 17. I coulda been you Warwick, I coulda made money. - So why didn't ya? - There's such a thing as responsibility, not that you'd know. You need money Andy? Why don't you marry some woman whose father's got millions like Warwick? - That's bullshit. - You know Bec's dad drives a postal van and I'm proud of that. - Course you are mate. - Now don't patronize me Michael because I am proud of who I am. I mightn't be you. I mightn't be Warwick. - Ian, you know that's enough mate. - No, you shut up. You think you're so tough because you tore some guy's shirt in a pub, big deal! - Hey mate, you're pissed and past your bedtime. - You know what the truth is? You're nothing but a coward. - You're a bloody idiot, go to bed. - And a phony. Sittin' in your car like your gonna kill yourself over Laurence, that was such a load of shit. You wouldn't have the guts to top yourself. You know that night at school after the play all you thought about was yourself. It was bad enough Laurence died because of you but you had to ruin Matthew's career as well. - Hey, who are you to judge me anyway? I don't have to sit here and listen to some dickhead suburban lawyer tell me anything. - You know I'm right Warwick, we all do. - Ian. - Did you say one word in his defense? - Ian. - Did you? - Ian, drop it. - No, when he stepped in and took the blame you let him. You bought those drugs. You put 'em in the punch. You Warwick. - It was all of us. - No it wasn't. Maybe you didn't kill Laurence but you sat by and watched a man's career go down the drain and you said nothing. - Are you not listening to me Ian? I said it was all of us. Mikey? - Well maybe you coulda said something Waz. - You want a beer? - No thanks mate. - Ian, what the hell. - Cheers. - Go to buggery. - Tell him I left will you? No! Hey, Dougie! Hey, Doug. Whatcha doin'? Hey! Doug. Hey. I'm sorry mate. I'm sorry, that's all I can say mate. - You go to hell. - Hey, Dougie, Dougie. - Just piss off. - Stop this, come on. Okay I'll leave you alone. But you tell me you're gonna be all right. - No I haven't thought about that yet. - Well Doug I'm leaving you standing here. I need to know you're not gonna do anything. - No Michael, it would take so much more than you to kill me. Go away. - Is he all right? - Yeah, he's fine, think. - Think? What do ya mean? - He's in the water. - What? - Well, we'd better go an get him. - It's better if you don't. - We can't just sit here. - Can you just wait, please? Don't say a thing! Not one word all right? You gonna stand there all night Schofield? - Okay, king bets 50. - Twos have it. By the way you can forget what I said in the kitchen. I asked him, no I begged him, for a job on an ad campaign. I slimed for something that I don't want so I can impress a wife who's screwing someone else. - Dougie let's just play cards. - We are playing cards. I'm the dealer and we're playing dealer's rules and the rule is you say what you think. You can stuff your ad campaign. I don't give a shit whether you do it Flick's or anywhere else 'cause I don't work there anymore. Who's in? Down cards, this is the one guys. Don't show it to your neighbors, don't let 'em see it whatever you do. - Dougie come on. - Shut up Andy. It's my deal. - Don't wanna sleep on it Doug? You need a job for Christ sake. - Dealer bets the limit, 20 bucks. What, a job? No I need a life. Spent the last 10 years pissing mine away. All right who's in? - A lotta people would like your life Dougie. - Then a lotta people can have my life Wazzo. Now who's in? Good, didn't hurt so much did it to show some guts for a change? Right. Who beat my three twos? - Not me. - Not me. - Three jacks. - You shifty devil. - You bluffin' me. - Ladies and gentlemen, the name of this game is five card stud. One down, one up, aces in the hole. Down and dirty at the end there. No who's got the guts to... - This is awful. - Is it? For you I mean, awful? - Of course it is Doug. - Not of course Ali. I mean you screwing another man. How am I supposed to take that? Am I just to disappear now so you can get on with it? - No, I don't want that. - Well. Why did you do that for, what did you smash everything for? - I don't know, you know? It's, I don't wanna lose you Doug. - You don't wanna lose me, you screwed my best friend but you don't wanna lose me? We made promises and you let him, you let him into a place and not just physically I mean in your heart. What the, what does it say about me and you spoke to this guy while I was under the same roof! Don't you give a shit about me? - Honey, when I heard your voice on the phone I, I mean I felt so bad. My heart just. - Oh yeah I know. I know, when I, when I heard you two on the phone, you know what I thought about? I thought about how you and me used to speak, long time ago. And then I heard that sex sound in your voice. Oh Ali, what happened. - God you know the number of times I tried to signal that things were going wrong and the more I tried the more you shut me out. - We're both drowning huh? Well, we can deal with this stuff when I get home. Bye. - Bye. - No really, no thanks. Look you couldn't have done anymore. It's you were right to call now, thank you. Yeah, really. Hey, yeah, okay fine, see ya. - Wait a minute. I found this on Friday. Was gonna get I blown up for you but I changed my mind. Anyway, it's for you. - Doug. - There nothing left to be said Michael. - What you said last night, dealer's rules, you say what you mean, you speak the truth. - Well no one expects you-- - So here's the truth. I didn't get it. - Get what? - Pre-selection, I just found out. Marty Maguire had me up here all weekend so he roll me. Tore apart my support then took it for himself. So that's what I get for turning my back. - Tell me about it. - Just thought it might make you feel a bit better, that's all. Mate I'm, sunk. I got nothin' at work and I got nothin' with Ali. With Ali it wasn't, it wasn't love, not for her. It was-- - Sex. - Confusion. You had her confused Doug. You'd gone away somewhere and I was there. But she really loves you Doug. She told me that, a lot. - Not you. - Yeah I love you too Dougie, you know that. - Here. - Ah, thanks. - I missed your last speech Dougie. Do you wanna say somethin'? - "Give every man thine ear but few thy voice. "Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. "This above all, to thine own self be true. "And it must follow, as the night the day. "Thou canst not then be false to any man." See ya Ian. - Hey, see ya Andy. - Yeah you take care of that beautiful family, all right? - Cheers. - Well, that was fun. All right why don't we all do I again next year, eh? - See ya Waz. See ya matey. - Hey, see ya mate. - Listen, what do you want for a wedding present? - World peace. - Well, I'll go looking. - Okay. Doug. See ya mate. - So do you still wanna live in the bush? - More than ever. So I guess I'll see ya at the wedding? Bring Ali, eh?
