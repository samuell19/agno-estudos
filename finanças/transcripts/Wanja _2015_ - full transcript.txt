Two glasses and... one, two, three, four plates. Cutlery seems to be missing. Works. Shower curtain's missing. That works. The key. Here's a phone list. This is your number. Gudrun Römer will contact you. Mr Zawatskij is on permanent sick leave. Your new probation officer is Nicolas Pedersen. He'll also contact you. Parole means not only control, but also support. You always have to be available. The employment office is in the city. I suggest you go there tomorrow. Hello. No. Yeah, that's what I mean. Exactly. And... That's fine with me. Then let's do it. Great, Otto. Talk to you later. Bye. Wonderful. You can go right over to Otto's. Otto Schröder. He already knows the process, but please tell him to sign these papers as soon as possible, or you won't get any benefits. The internship lasts for three months and could lead to a full-time job. Thanks. You're from the employment agency, right? Wait a second. It's Wanja, right? Come on, I'll show you something. You can hold him if you want. We can sell them in four weeks. Why were you in jail? Excuse me? Come on, tell me. Bank robbery. Among other things. I got seven years. Oh, shit. Did you really use guns and stuff? Not more than 30, OK? Otherwise it gets mushy and bad. Lizards get fed twice a day. Vegetables or grasshoppers. They prefer grasshoppers. Ten euros. Same time tomorrow, OK? I... need bird feed. Could we subtract it from my salary? Yeah, OK. Take it. What kind of bird is it? It's like... I don't know, a big one. You can take this. Thanks. Tastes good, huh? Need help? Yeah. Thanks. Wanja? I'm Nicolas, your probation officer. I'm really sorry that I'm so late. Do you want something to drink? No, I want to smoke. I could smoke one, too. Thanks. I heard about your job. At a pet shop. But it's just an internship. - But that's great. Your file says you have a daughter, are you in contact? Why not? That's none of your business, right? Well... I'm heading this way. I'll come along. It's your first time in Sulingen, right? It's actually really nice here. A lot of hiking trails, woods... There's a really great lake. We go swimming there when it's warm. You know what? Next time, we'll do something totally different, something really fun, OK? Whatever. Bye. Bye. You really fucked up. What? - Don't pretend. Money's missing from the register. No, that wasn't me. - I recounted ten times. You're lucky I don't call the police. Get out! You're lying! Get out, I said! - You're lying! Out! Thief! You're a thief! What do you want? - Do you need someone in the stable? Don't think so. Not even an intern or something? Then you'll have to ask Rudi, he's here tomorrow. OK, yeah. It's going well. Yeah, I'll bring them over. Yeah, bye. I promise, yes. Bye. Here. A beer, please. May I? Such bad weather, right? But next week it should be better. I'd rather be in Thailand. Thailand? Do you know it? No. It's a fantastic place. The food is great. Pad Thai. A noodle dish, you know it? It's amazing with chicken or fish. It doesn't have to be spicy, but usually it is, very much so. The sun always shines, it's very friendly. Have you ever been there? Need a light? Wait, I have one. I don't have it here. Sorry. No worries. Morning. You have to clean the aquarium. Otherwise the fish will suffocate and die. When will we meet again? Martin's birthday is on Friday. Wanna come? There'll be a band and some dancing. And free beers. Hey, hello! Rudi's in the back. And you say you had a horse? Yes. Well, yes. What kind? It was brown, pretty big, and had a white spot on its forehead. A crossbreed. I think so. Or a thoroughbred? It was just a riding horse. But you know how to ride? - Yeah. And how to clean stables? Well, of course. The internship is for the employment office? - Yeah. Otherwise, I won't get paid. And it won't cost us a thing? No, nothing at all. And how often could you be here? I could... be here the whole day. Late in the evening or at night. Early in the morning works as well. Alright. Wanja. This is Annelie, Kevin, Robbe and Dennis. This is Wanja, our new assistant. Didn't we say not over 15? I'll show you the carts. You coming to the loft? Sure. Do you need help? Maybe. For what? I'll tell you when we're up there. Yes or no? Fuck you. Alright then. Are you OK? - Yeah How's the internship going? I had to change. I'm working at a racing stable. Racing stable? Sounds great! Stop. This is me. Thanks. You were really good today. Well, actually no surprise. Bye. Harness. Crupper. Then the belly-strap. Put on the gaiters. Everything OK? And then the ear plugs. We don't remove them until right before the race. So the horse gets an extra kick. Let's put the cart on and then we're ready. Let him loose. Let me know when you're ready, Grandma. I'm waiting for you. Don't worry. They're childish and retarded. Rudi said we should go riding today. Annelie is ill, so you'll take Lucky. Now? Yeah, OK. Where are you from? - From here, a small town up north. And what are you doing here? I live here. In the middle of nowhere. It's not that bad. I think it is. Nothing ever happens here. I hate this place. Where do you live? At Kevin's. But sometimes I sleep in the stables. In the stables? Only when Kevin needs some space. I'm his first girlfriend, you know. So... let's do one slow round. then two fast ones and another slow one. Everything OK? You have no clue, right? You don't even know how to ride. You're so crazy. If you want, I could teach you how to ride. But... you need to buy me alcohol. Lots of it. I can't do that. Rudi will fire you. For sure. Right away. Well, Mrs Walloschke... concerning the internship at the racing stables .. I mean... that's not working. Why? I don't understand. It's simple. We have to validate your internship. Right? We have to visit the employer. Tell him to contact us. We'll make an appointment. Right. Until then you won't get unemployment benefits. I'm sorry. But what should I do? You can go to the social welfare office. It's in this very building. Here. Just call them, explain your situation, and you'll get an appointment. Fine. We're going bowling and then to Shagall. Want to come? No, thanks. Come on. We'll play girls against boys. We'll crush them. There's a shower up there. I'll give you make-up and clothes. You'll do better next time, doesn't matter. You'll never make it, baby! The rest of the night is on you, right? What the hell is he doing? Dude, do it right! You have to play right. She has no clue. Hurry up, Grandma! Get this over with! I love you! - I'm pissed, guys. We won! - Yeah! How do you know Emma? - From work! And now you're best friends or what? Maybe! But you're twice as old as Emma. I mean you could be her mother. I don't get it. What don't you get? Why are you running after her? Are you a lesbian? Hey, I have to tell you something. But don't tell anyone. Should I take your bag? - Yeah. I'm pregnant. What? - Crazy, right? I think it's Kevin's... About recently at the stables... I'm really fucking sorry. Really. I just wanted to joke a bit, you know? Are you still angry? No. Man, I didn't mean it like that, OK? But if you change your mind, let me know, OK? Just fuck off! Hey, dickhead, you have guests. You alright? What? - Are you alright? Yeah, of course. Wanja? Try this. Kevin stole it. What? From the stables. Keta. Don't do it. Come on. It's really great. Hello? We're closed. It's quitting time. - I'll just take that. Just put it on a plate. Please. Five euros are enough, right? Do you have spicy sauce or something? I... I'll see what I can find. Bathrooms there, right? Do you have a sauce or something? And how are you doing otherwise? Good. I got you an appointment at the drug counselling centre. I'd like you to go there. It's good for you to meet people stuck in the same situation as you. You can broaden your network that way. But I don't do drugs anymore. I want you to give it a chance, OK? We'll meet here again in 14 days. Could you call the employment agency? You see, it's about my internship. They refuse to validate it, but... if you'd maybe call... - I can't do something like that. There are no short cuts in life. Take an apple. They're healthy. I dropped out of school. My mother kicked me out and... my father doesn't care about me anymore. Rudi says I should definitely continue. I could turn pro. I won every race last year. I could earn a lot of money. What would you do with it? Don't know. I just want to have it. If you have nothing, you are nothing. Maybe. Come on, I'll show you something. Are you coming? I used to be here all the time. Want some? It tastes like candy. I like it. Have you told Kevin? I've already made a decision. Walter? It's your tum. Go ahead. Hello, I'm Walter and I'm a drug addict. Hello, Walter. But I've been clean for three months. Your mother must be proud of you. Yes. She invited me over for tomorrow afternoon. Great! I'm proud of you, Walter. Thanks. Pass it on, please. Please. Hi, I'm Wanja. Well, I haven't taken anything for three years. Anyway... the welfare office wanted me to come. Wasn't my idea. Hello, Wanja. Thanks for coming. Hello, Wanja. It won't be so bad. Emma Hofmann? Will you wait for me? You'll get the bill in the mail. Can I pay it now instead? - Of course. Are you OK? It hurt like hell. She didn't even look at me, as if I were an object or something. You'll be better soon. I can't be in the stables for a week. Here. You're burning. The doctor said I might get a fever. She gave me some pills. I'll go now, OK? Wanja? Please... don't tell Kevin. And... could you talk to Rudi? Just tell him I'm ill. Thanks. You're my only friend. Not so hard. Sorry. I want to quit. That's good. You can help me. There's a bag in the closet. Take it with you and keep it. Kevin will probably want it back. Are you coming or what? Coming? Where to? How was your week? Nothing special. It's OK if you don't want to talk about your work. I don't like it when people just talk about work as if nothing else mattered. Well, we currently have a lot to do. A lot of roof work. Office and shop constructions, lots to do. See? People who only talk about their work are pretty boring. I have to feed my pets. Really? How many do you have? I don't know exactly. Bye. Bye. What's with Emma? Is she still ill? Yeah, she's super ill. What's so funny about that? Nothing. From now on, you'll take care of him. What's with Emma? - She's finished. What do you mean? - Too much partying. Are you ready? Hello, I'm Nicolas. Are you Lisa? Hello, Lisa. Yes, hold on a moment. Hello, little mouse. So how are you? A big hug from me. How... was your holiday? Hello? Your holiday, how was it, hm? Are you... still there? Little mouse? Hello? Emma! Think I don't know what you're up to? What do you mean? You're a bitch. You're just taking my place. Do you know how long I've been waiting for this? Emma, what's going on? - 40 and still an intern. Everyone laughs at you. Emma, you're high. What's going on? Emma, watch it! - Fuck you! Emma, please. What do you want? Come on, let me in. Where's Kevin? Some job. He's doing something new. When's he coming back? No idea. It's been a couple of days. What's he doing now? Something new, I don't know. Why are you asking so much? Are you after him? I want you to be there tomorrow at the race. That's not for you to decide. I talked to Rudi, he wants it as well. You're coming, right? She's not coming, right? Then it's your turn if we win. Go! Please! Emma! Hello. I hate you. I just want to help you. Everything OK? You look really bad. You should take some holiday. Have a break. Your parents live in the middle of nowhere.
