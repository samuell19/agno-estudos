THE DARK ROOM At that time lived in France a certain Esnard, Count of Roussillon, who was in poor health. He entrusted his only son, Bertrand, to his widely-esteemed physician, Gerard from Narbonne, so he'd be raised with other children his age. That physician was my father, who raised me with a cousin. The cousin's name was Thomas: they all had names. My name was Menu. Would I be Alienor, had I not been called Alienor? The world was round, and I was where I belonged... 25, 26, .. 33, 34, .. In the wardrobe! He was found in the woods. He got hit. He was a woodcutter. They brought him for treatment, but left him behind. Want a closer look? What would you choose? Your father's death, or eating a live toad? You must answer! Eating a live toad! There you are! Bertrand, I have to talk to you... It's about your father. He was found dead this morning. He died in his sleep. You no longer belong here... Now you're a ward of the King of France. Bertrand? A horseman waits below We'll always be here. You'll come back! Where were you, I looked everywhere! You should run faster! You don't understand, Thomas. Bertrand is leaving us. Let's see the urine... It contains dozens of significant clues. No matter ﬂoats in it... Good, no traces of sugar. Where does it hurt? Since when? Any vomiting? Diarrhea? How old are you? 51. Here's why you're bilious: the current astral configuration has played havoc with your moods. By the principle that "like can cure like", I'm prescribing you celandine. Its yellow juice will chase away your bilious complexion. To kill your fever, a plaster of cantharides mustard. I'll stop by again. Get some sleep, and no wine! Are we agreed? Whatever you say. And how are you? Well? The seat of lust is the navel! You charge a lot! They're my fees. It's only fair. Some patients, even rich ones, offer their physician a mason's wages. How dare they remunerate "mechanics", Who only deal with accessories, like a practitioner of the human body? I insist, as you noticed, on payment in cash. An expensive remedy is usually effective. A gratuitous one... serves no purpose: the patient has less confidence. One must get money from these oafs. And give sicknesses terrible names. Why? To a sick man talk he doesn't understand is more impressive. What matters is touching a patient, rm knowledge oi names. It's also true of diagnosis, that cannot be done from afar. Often, we are asked for advice. Never take on patients you can't examine personally. And religion? It cannot ease all suffering. Dad, what about good and evil? There are only good and bad things! Bad ones are indigestion, intoxication, lack of desire. Good is the opposite. It's what agrees with our nature and intensifies life. You see? I'd really like to learn medicine. I could marry you in a dozen places, if you agreed. I love one man! Who is gone. What is it? Take your hand off, Thomas. I'm returning to Montpellier. To study. Wait! No, nothing. Do as you wish! In Paris, they treat a fistula with grass on the lungs! What? And think they'll save him! Why!? The King is gravely ill. I heard it from a colleague. Really? The King... Is Bertrand still there? They've tried yarrow, agrimony, a few poison cures, and now plaster his lungs with grass! This case calls for my formula. The one where you introduce minerals? Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide. I've seen it work on several patients. "Fistula procibo!" It's in your book! Why don't you go? On what grounds? I'm only a country doctor, how could I? I'd like to try. Don't think of it! Let me go there! You? It's madness! Our King's life is at stake! Won't you let me try your formula? Father, give me your consent. No, you'll stay here with me, and for your own good. Remember Marie d'Avignon, Who tried to heal the Pope? You know how she ended up? This girl... She got in! How dare she? Still need us, my liege? I don't think so. Then, we'll leave you. His name is Bertrand of Roussillon. Where is he? Do you know where you are? I'll only speak to him! How will we know which legs are ours? I don't know which are mine! With those legs, no one will look at you! Then give me back mine! Which ones are they? Bertrand, stop it! She's from Roussillon. Are you sure? You remember me? It was long ago! You're alone? What happened? Does your father know... No. He doesn't know. I just left. If I'd waited, it would've been too late. Merchants, people I didn't know, helped me. That's howl got in, and here I am. With nowhere else to go now. Was it a bad idea? No, a very good one! I hear you've become a knight in armor, but neglect jousting and are fascinated by goldsmiths, organ builders and other artisans. You saw the rain? The ground is soggy. March is the wrong season for tourneys. Am I disturbing you? Why would you? Since my mother died, I get no news from Roussillon. What do you do here for amusement? Visit the palace kitchens. That's quite enough. You've made no commitment? You're promised to no one? I don't look that far ahead. I came to see the King. The King? That's impossible! He no longer leaves his bedroom. His pain is so great that he can't even sleep. His sore smells so foul that he lets few familiars in. His sickness may be curable. Odors don't disturb me... Well, it depends whose... The odor won't matter. One has to put up with it! Why do you so wish to see him? Isn't this hasty? Can you explain? I sense I can heal him. Intercede for me. You realize what you ask? Let me be received and convince him. You're my only venue. Do you mind? I can try. I'll get word to you. Where do you know her from? My childhood. She used to collect pill-boxes and ﬂacons. She'd say: "You like this one or that?" Never both! That's not what worries me. She thinks she can heal the King. With a personal cure. Heal the King? Based solely on her conviction? She says she has a that others don't have. He's in the hands of a female doctor. How can that be? It seems she is endowed with powers. She had a calling which she feels untitles her... The King has agreed? He's alone with her. That's amazing! Where is it? Show me the wound. I'll heal you. How can a girl of your age be sure of success? You're not the first. The most learned doctors have come. All made promises. In vain! That's where I stand. Try as it may, no art can remedy this desperate situation. Go home, young lady. You may become troublesome. You wish to aid me, but I know things you don't. I must not listen to you. Sire. I'll heal you within eight days. If you'll take the remedies I give you. They'll cause you no pain. No, I've decided to take no more remedies. Then you refuse? What harm in trying, since you deny all recovery? What do you fear? Eight days will go by fast. Some of the greatest works are achieved by the simplest of means. You have such confidence? Where shall I lodge her? At Anne de Lulle's, with a page to wait on her. She may be my salvation. Yes, Sire. Sire, we know little about this girl. Physicians of that nature rarely stay in their place of birth. Often they are only prized because they're from distant parts. Don't move, Sire. It tires you. There! First of all, with your permission, we'll lodge her elsewhere, in a tower of which I'll hold the key. Let's first ascertain her morals and beliefs. She may have deluded herself. We can't look foolish in the eyes of foreigners. - What are you doing here? - Waiting. For what? Are you treating the King? I may not touch him. Not until a committee of theologians has seen me. What shall I tell them? Tell them... that God sent you. I only preach the use of medicine! Gentlemen, I need your attention. The young girl you'll examine, says she was sent by God to help the King recover his health. What we must verify, may I remind you, is if she's an instrument of the Devil, or if she was truly sent by our Creator. We know the messenger of God may be an angel, or an animal, like the raven Who fed Elijah, but it can also be a human creature, even a woman The Bible tells of women sent by the Lord to save Israel, Deborah, Jahel, Judith. Here she is. You be the judges. Answer truthfully in every instance! Why did you come? The King wishes to know what drove you to see him. A voice said to me: "Alienor, God will have mercy on the King. "You must go to his side." I did what I was told. I reached him without hindrance. What were you doing the morning you heard this voice? I was asleep. The voice woke me. Did the sound wake you? Were you touched anywhere? I wasn't touched: it was a voice. Is that voice still in your bedroom? Not that I know. But it's in the palace. Where exactly? It spoke to me once again in a corridor. She's confusing us! First, let us make sure of an essential point. To ascertain if, as she claims, she is a virgin. Indeed, virginity is a suit of armor that breaks the arrows of Hell like straws. A sure way to see if she practices witchcraft! You all agree? We shall resort to it. Let go of me! Let go! There's nothing we can do. Obey and you'll be fine. The matrons found her a true virgin, without signs of corruption, or traces of violence. So much we know... Do you believe in God? Yes. Even more so than you! I believe in trees, sun, water, all of nature, and all that lives. But I eat beef and kill mosquitoes! Listen to her! She's impertinent and foolhardy! She surely led some gang in her village. She'll get nowhere that way! But her replies do bear witness to a strong faith. Du you pray'!? From morning to night. Only in your head? I'm mostly with others in my head. But can we advise the King to trust in her on her word alone? We need a sign that God wants us to believe you. I didn't come to Paris to make signs. Take me to the King. Give us a sign! The sign I shall give you is his recovery. I share your doubts, but ask your prudence. In these times of endless troubles in our cities, rejecting her without evidence of evil is to refute the Holy Ghost. We must be very careful. There's more to it: outside our walls, others contest us, fomenting disorders, coveting the royal privileges we are granted. Then let us wait for this sign. And if no sign comes? You know the punishment for heretics and witches? If you fail, you'll be burnt alive in public. Any other questions? We shall soon know! Guards! I'm hungry- That's the sign! There's no doubt! It's the sign! See, you're not abandoned. Come here. Beautiful child, you have saved me. I'll show you gratitude: I owe you much. How do you wish to be rewarded? I don't know. What would you like? What may I hope for? A dowry, if, as I suppose, you intend to get married. Then I beg Your Majesty to grant me the husband of my choice. Fear not that I'll choose one of royal blood. Benefactress, come beside your patient. All those noble young bachelors are at your disposal. I have powers and paternal authority over them. Any spouse is yours for the choosing, just say which. If any shuns your love, he'll lose mine. You see him? That's Louis de Coutes, 46 years old. From a soldierly family. An excellent party, Who is free. Perfect for you. Yes, but I don't see myself with him. And the one smiling over there? A cousin of the Duke of Burgundy, Richard d'Orlhac. I'm very fond of him. Too bilious! A pity, he's loyal and honorable. And the one wearing a chain, Jean de Vaucourd, a nephew of mine. How old? Close to thirty. And I assure you, no man has more courage. But he's cross-eyed! And I can tell he's bad tempered. I must be happy, otherwise... Let's try another. Someone less cranky, more sincere? More manageable? More discreet? You'll find ﬂaws in all of them. Then who? Him! Bertrand, now you’re an adult and mil-endowed. Have you thought of getting married? Not really, Sire. Here's your chance. You'll return to your province with a young lady I've chosen as your wife. Is that unreasonable? Who is she? The very one Who gave me back my health. What do you say? I think you know her. It's an unfortunate fantasy of hers! Can't I stay as I am? Take someone else! You're Who she trusts! Sire, as you are my liege, this marriage cannot make me happy. This distaste will pass, scornful lad. She's a good and sincere girl. You'll like her too, I'm sure of it. You'll have a finer life with her than with a highborn lady. I made a promise. Would you make me break my word to this child? It would be infamous. I'm too sure of your fondness for me. You can't think of me! Yes I do, and very seriously. Come in! Cam una, sanguis unus. God bless you! Kiss her. She's now your wife! Now, with your permission, I wish to leave. Sure? Won't you stay longer with your King? I wish to consummate this marriage on my land. Go to Roussillon. We'll join you there. - As you wish. - She'll become a pawn here. If it's known she can work miracles... As for me, I've lived up to my word. That's all right. Here they are! Put all that in the main bedroom! The Countess of Roussillon. This is Azalaïs, your personal maid. A nightingale. It's in that tree! Many birds are singing today. I'll have supper readied, I request your presence, you're my guest of honor. I've already given orders. You've already taken over! It's our wedding feast. Azalaïs? Are you married? Why do you ask? Out of friendship. May I join you? If you wish. This is my My! I meant no reproach. You're free. "No systematic bleeding." Are you sure of this? - I can't be her husband. - You're wed! It's final! We'll see. I need to be far from her. Here she is! Listen to me. Do all knights treat their wives like you? Are these your house rules? - Let's talk, please. - What of? The science that gave you powers over me? Over all bodies, and decreed that you could buy me? I have a long ride today. As my wife, you may live here. I'll live elsewhere. You're burning! Why doesn't my lord care for me? I know how you feel. Try to forget him. Shall I send for a physician? No, thank you! Then your father? No, not him. I don't want him to know. Shall I get Guérin? He's an excellent singer and musician. He's here. Would you like to hear him? Troops riding by! What shall we do? It's Malvoisin! He protects us. You're too suspicious. Lord Malvoisin! Take my advice, don't make us massacre you! Ride on! Staying at home takes courage. They'd love to chop us up and loot us! Madam, one of our farmers is sick. No, Azalaïs. Tell them to seek help across the river. I'll never treat anyone again. Never, I told you. I hoped time would bring my husband back. But I've heard a rumor, as you may have too, that the Count is fighting for Florence against Sienna. You're his barons. Find him in Tuscany, try to learn of his intentions, let him know that if he left his domain because of me, I'll leave it to content him. It's a long journey, madam. Florence gave him a regiment. You'll find him easily. If you truly wish it. Take this. You'll need it. Don't worry, we'll find him for you. Find him fast. There she is! Let's stop! It's that same girl! Who is she? Lisotta. A young noblewoman Who tends to orphans. They're var-orphans. She's fearless! Where does she live? The far end of the village, with her mother. So he doesn't feel he's my husband? The marriage wasn't consummated. Really... He said that? He enjoys what he's doing. It's his age, madam. Don't despair. Thank you, my lords. I made a mistake. Now, it's my turn for a resolution. We must leave. Tomorrow after the meeting. Has everyone been informed? All the landowners. Who are you? Bertrand? Raise your helmet, so I can see your face. Thomas... Is it you? Why this? You frightened me! Forgive me. I couldn't wait for tomorrows meeting. Your servant told me of it. I couldn't sleep, and without armor, in times like this... Help me. Take me in your arms. They say a man in armor is best! Let go of me! Leave, or I'll call my women! How can you be such a fool? I must plan my future flawlessly! Let's take this off. You're wounded? Is that better? There! Watch your sleeve until it's dry. Why don't you do a real drawing? Why do you say that? You just sketch! My lords, listen to me. Some of you know what I did for the Count's love, and what ensued. I called you here after contacting him again, via these two gentlemen. My presence here is depriving you of seeing your lord. Therefore... I've decided to leave this county, to spend the rest of my days as a pilgrim, hoping to save my soul. I pray you to take over the governing of this county. Tell my husband I've resigned. Let him know I only did it so he could return to his lands. I'll never come back, so he'll have peace. Your people are behind you! Madam, you offend us. Why go elsewhere? No one can divert me from my intention. If I'm no longer here, I'm sure the Count will return. I give it back, and renounce my station. Excuse me, my lords. There is no other my. I'll lose him, but I can't mil any longer. Come. D as in...? It has a round head, long body, four wings... I showed them to you in the mods. From the Count of Roussillon. What is it? Here. It's for your charities. Another gift? It's all for you. Thank you. Thank you kindly. What are you up to with the Count of Roussillon? Nothing at all. What's inside, dear child? I want to see. Your protector goes to any lengths! Yesterday a book of hours, now a basketful of aims! What will he give you tomorrow'? M as in...? Mayﬂy! It has many legs! Right. Donato... Tell us the names of other insects. There's the butterﬂy. That was good thinking... What does it feed on? You saw her? Was she glad? She ms. She said nothing, gave you nothing? The sacristan was there, never left us alone. He watches her. What did you see in her eyes? In her eyes... Almost love... Don't move. Stand up, so I can see if it suits you. Turn around, so I see your back. How do I look? More suitable! May I? Of course, come in. "Iv daughter! Madam, I'd like to speak to you. Get dressed, you'll try it on again tomorrow Come... Your daughter is grown and beautiful, ready for marriage. Word reached me that she is loved by Bertrand of Roussillon? Madam, Who are you? I'm his wife. Really? You're his wife? I don't know if he loves her sincerely... But he does all he can to persuade her of it. I have seen him in church: his eyes never leave her. I try to keep him away, but I'm at my wit's end. Madam... It seems fate has smiled on you as little as on me. But if you are willing, you can console us both. There is nothing I'd rather do than console myself honestly, and if it's also advisable... "if anyone can see me, see that you tell me... "And if they can see me, tell me at once..." Where is Alienor? You won't find her. Why? She has entered a convent. What? Are you sure? You let her leave? Did she seem despaired? Resigned, rather. "If anyone can see me, see that you tell me... "And if they can see me, tell me at once..." Holy mother, I think my cousin Alienor is in hereto do penance. I wish to speak to her. Even if she were here, you couldn't see her. Our nuns are selected from among the most devout. Their identity is secret. They may not hear any temporal chatter, or superﬂuous words. Listen to them... They transport their souls with song. What are you doing here? Don't move! Are there many? Most of our nuns are unfortunates: too ugly or too poor to be marriageable. They're all from Florence or Lucca. Now, leave. Don't make trouble! Sister Silvana, you're going for a walk? I was going to my algebra class. You were confined to bed! I'll come by in a moment. Go to your room! What are you waiting for? Marc! At last I'll meet her! We have an appointment. - You do? - At the new moon. At night? Yes, my? Young girls sometimes play childish pranks, but this is odd. Sure it isn't a trap? - How? - She may be a spy for Sienna! You see spies everywhere! You got this from Lisotta, Who tends orphans? So you see? Can you mix colors? No. Hows it done? - Can you draw? - I always have. I need assistants. Care to learn? Alberto, show him how you prepare mortar. He does the faces. You divide up the work? They seem so real! We use the whole length of the wall. They stand for more than formal goodness, some risk their lives! That lends them might. 3 of our brothers are in Africa: this may be your chance. - They're due back? - By winter. If they return, with Christ's help! It lacks horsehair. You have soap? Our assistants are forbidden to wash. When do you rise? At six in winter. In summer, between four and five. Before daybreak, that's the rule. Shall I have a tunic brought? I didn't know the singularities of this workshop. We can help you, but you must pitch in, too! "Never be proud. Or sleepy. "Or grumble. Or gossip. "Never lust, or envy. "Never wish to be called a saint." Hush, my mother is close by. You asked to see me? To what do I owe this? My mother went to a marriage broker. I'm to be wed to a man I don't love. He's a braggart. I hate him! The future offers me no hope. I'd rather be dead! If I'm sentenced to live with this man, I want to know love first. With you... Do you understand the cruel fate of women? Indeed I do! I, a knight, this happened to me... What? A wretch I never pursued, got me as a reward from the King of France. I was compelled to marry her! You'd never met her? Once, along time ago. A glance can be enough... It was all in her head. If you'd hardly met, why was her heart set on you? She does a man's job and thinks it can get her anything. It's so humiliating! I doubt a woman could only see you as a king's reward! Anyway, she got nothing from me. Don't fret over it... I just want you to hold me in your arms. You'll be first, or I'll go mad. We must leave, day is breaking. So early? My mother is asleep, but not for long. A patron. Rest. We'll resume later. You have a model for the Virgin Mary? I had one with a most pure face. Alas, she married. Why? I want Virgin Mary resembling a girl I know. Is she a moral person? Will that do? I'd have to see her. She's very shy. I cannot persuade her. But I can describe her. She is gentle and full of modesty. She has brown hair, frail shoulders, delicious arms. Her round face is radiant, large eyes, a small, delicate nose and an exquisite mouth. The subject lends itself to perfection! Where does she live? - Maybe I know her? - I doubt it. Her mother is watchful! - You, there! - Me? Yes, you! Here's your big chance: a portrait of a girl. All we know is she has brown hair, a gentle face, a graceful neck, an exquisite mouth, two eyes like stars, and she's called Lisotta. Try to see her and get to work. But be discreet. It seems she's most modest. Very well. My beauty, are you there? I dreamt I'd lost you. You disappeared! Gently... I saw you in the mods, sitting alone under an oak. The children were gone, to your dismay. Then a big black horse galloped toward you, neck lowered, inviting you to mount it. Panning the ground, neighing. You grasped its mane, and raised yourself. The horse shuddered, barely stopped, and raced off at a furious pace, jumping not hedges, but tall mountains! Then there was a cliff... Below, deep waters, for the horse to throw you to your death... This peril made you cross yourself: the horse left you... twisting under you like a scalded eel, it leapt alone into the foamy waters, leaving you dazed on a narrow shore... A black horse? I was terrified: you had escaped from the Devil. I'll take you from this house. You won't belong to that man! Take this ring. I'm very attached to it. It's a family heirloom. Wear it. May I keep it? Yes, it's yours. Then we're united for life. Well, have you done them? Your sketches of the Virgin Mary! The master is furious! What Virgin Mary? She never appeared. But she's visited every night, and not by the Holy Ghost! - What are you saying? - I saw a man enter this house. Three nights in a row. A man? The client is in a hurry. Find a solution! Show me the portrait! I just finished it. You may view it at your leisure. There... But it's not her! It's not at all like her! What's more, it's everything I detest! That nose, those hands, the brazen look! The smile ﬂoating on her lips! What's missing? It's easy to correct, but I need the model. A Madonna and child needs time, contemplation, intimacy, mystery... If she can't come, I'll find a way to see her at home. You won't find her, she's gone! She and her mother were seen leaving with their belongings. I thought you were worthy. You're unreliable. Your Virgin Mary is bizarre. Does she resemble the model? I don't know. I did what you said. I'm not gifted... No, you are gifted! Know what I think? You used another model. Who was she? No one! I never saw her. I did it from memory. That's how you take it? Pack! Ready my horse and my weapons! - We're leaving? - For Roussillon. - We didn't look everywhere! - I've given my leave. Long rests after combat, help neither war nor peace. My vassals need me. Here the heat is stiﬂing! I told you... She was betrothed. Thomas! You're back in Montpellier! Is it true? You live here now? At last I've found you! I missed you. You're so skinny. Now I know my sickness. What sickness? I'm possessed by one thought: it makes me look everywhere for you. Ambrogio hired me as an apprentice. I lost my job. But how? I think I understand. You do? Yes, I love you. Without you, I'm miserable. I'm not free. How can you not be free? Your marriage is void, you know it! This will help Bertrand get the Papal annulment he wants. It will soon be pronounced. In September. So soon? In three months. At the start or the end of the month? The 14th. Soon you'll be free! I'm not free. It's too late, I assure you. I'm taken. I'm taken, Thomas! You hear? And I muted it! Does it have a father? Must be someone who's lost. Take me to your lord. I came for a private audience. I'll try to inform him. He's not there. You said it was the Countess of Roussillon? He's out. Where did he go? He can't be disturbed. You won't get in. Take him this message. Thank you. What can you say in your defense? He's a mute, Messire. - And you? - Me? I'm poor, and my wife is pregnant. These are repeated offenders. Forgery. Covered by article That's what I apply. Read me the charges. Today, Thursday 22nd, before the Council, presided by our master of justice, Count of Roussillon, the following cases were examined: Denis Bee, guilty of arson and assault, is sentenced to pay a fine of 18 sous to your treasury, and 50 sous to the victim. If unable to pay, he forfeits the hand that struck the victim, Who lost his arm. Raymond Vidal, guilty of perjury, is sentenced to have his tongue pierced by an iron pin, and to be banished after paying a fine of 65 sous. Petula Fouques, guilty of blasphemy and offending the Virgin Mary is fined 20 sous. As for Marsile and Garin Roques Who used loaded dice, I could sentence you to the pillory, but instead you'll do 60 hours of public service. There is a woman plaintiff. Now? It's rather late. She insists on appearing before you. What is the case? A paternity suit. A single woman? Who is she charging? She claims, sire, you'll be both judge and offender. Let her in. You, madam? How dare you? I tried other means. To meet you in good faith, but to no avail. Faced with this refusal, I appeal to your justice. I am, my Lord, the watched woman Who has loved you since childhood. Who left her country and your castle, to avoid depriving your dear subjects of your presence. You've taken steps to void our marriage. I ask you to reconsider this, in view of new disclosures. You recognize this ring? I've brought it to you. Not one son... but two, Who are yours. I admit it's my ring. You say you own it? Where did you buy it? Or Who gave it to you? It wasn't given or bought. Then Who lent it to you? No one lent it to me, either. Then where did you find it? I didn't find it. If it wasn't obtained in any such my, you stole it! How could I father these two creatures? They are yours, I assure you. How did this occur? I'm listening. The day after of my arrival in Tuscany, you chanced to ride through the village Where I had stopped. I asked an innkeeper. She told me you were courting a local girl. I soon persuaded her mother that she could help me. Lisotta lent me her room and went away. God let me lose my virginity to my husband. You say the woman I held in my arms, was you? Yes, it was me. That night and those that followed. I don't believe a word! Once I was pregnant, I gave up my pleasures with you to cease troubling Lisotta's mother. Then I stayed in Montpellier until I gave birth. Madam, I'm in no mood for this pack of lies! Shall I reveal how you gave me your ring? It was the night you saw me in dream. I was alone in the woods, when a black charger incited me to mount it. Grasping its mane, I was carried at a furious pace, jumping over hedges and mountains. Then there was a cliff, and below it deep waters. As the horse threw me to my death, I crossed myself. Terrified, you said I'd escaped from the Devil. BE quiet! This court is adjourned! I thought her gone! - Who? - She's back. In that room! The one I ﬂed from! It can't be! Can she be the woman I held in my arms? Why didn't I suspect it? She must have put me under a spell! Did she make you drink a brew? Did she scratch your body? I wasn't aware of it. - Did she take anything of yours? - Not that I noticed. Should I keep her or be done with her? What to do? Advise me: is she or isn't she the one I loved? It's a mystery... Place her in the same situation. You'll see! As dispenser of justice in this county, though you made use of painful and unworthy methods, I accept your proof, and admit I'm the father of those children. You may return to the marital home. For family reasons, we reinstate your rights. There... Now be good and go to sleep... You won't need me any more? Thank you, Azalaïs. I wish to sleep. A hot-water bottle? I'm fine. Good night. Are you asleep? Madam, marriage has other obligations. Sharing a roof isn't enough. Sit there. Were you taught the language of love? I have some intuition of it. Yes, you're very skilled. You regret it? I regret I was deceived. You never were. I always loved you, I belonged to no one else. But I loved another. You loved an appearance. A face at a window. I borrowed her name, but it was my body, my voice. The one you loved was me. You're truly diabolical. I think I had good reasons to ﬂee you. Then lie down. What are you doing? - What is it? - Don't touch me! Leave me alone! It's a remote place. Sometimes shepherds climb up here, as on a ladder... To catch sight of their stray animals. It's pleasantly fresh. Have a bed put up here. It's not for you? No, for my father. He studies botany. You sleep there? You and Bertrand don't share a bed? So soon? Marriage doesn't suit us. Where is he now? I have no idea. Chasing around the county. That's how you live? Yes, that's how. Don't let it bother you. Have you tried talking to him? It leads nowhere. I know he'll never love me. There may be a remedy. We need a predictive minimum. Remember Hippocrates' formula: "Similia similibus curantur". "Like can cure like." Dad! That orchard... Stags often go there at night. We'll check. Our heaters will send them up here. What are you waiting for? You must come at once. - Shall I come, too? - No, stay. I know this path. I haven't taken it in ages. You don't hunt here. They're replanting this forest. Agnes? Flora? Is that you, Clotilde? Me? You're a friend of hers? Does this life suit you? Why did you choose it? What do you mean? No... I'm not what you think. I'm married. But it's over and I don't mind. Now you know everything. Heavens, madam! What happened? You scared me! You're not hurt? Put it out! Put it out, she said! Then, leave! You remind me of a woman I loved and lost. Can we meet again this way? Have no fear, I'll know how to stay in the dark... Subtitles: A. Whitelaw Subtitling Titra Film Paris
