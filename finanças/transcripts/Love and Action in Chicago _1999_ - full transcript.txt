EDDIE (VOICEOVER): You may not know it and you may not care, but in every city in this great country we live in there are eliminators, people like me working for the US government. We're not spies and we're not cops. We eliminate people the government deems harmful to the American way of life. Hey, don't look shocked. This is the United States. And I'm Eddie Jones, rank GS19. [RINGING] EDDIE (RECORDING): Not in, call back. MIDDLEMAN (RECORDING): Eddie? Middleman. I have a new assignment for you. EDDIE (VOICEOVER): And I work really, really hard. BARTENDER: Sir, what can I get for you? Tea, please. [BEEPING] Drop it and back. Just put the case down and everything will be fine. [SCREAM] [HEAVY BREATHING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING AND CRYING] Hey, Eddie. Hi. Say hello to Eddie. Oh, no, no, no, [INAUDIBLE]. There, come on in. Ah, new suit? For you. Thank you. So, Eddie, in my opinion, you ought to take some time off. Thanks for your opinion, Middleman. You've been doing a lot of marks, where's the fire? I like to get things done. Well, slow down. I transferred you over here because I liked your work, not because I wanted you to break departmental records. And? I never promise anything. But the possibility still remains? In rare instances we have allowed someone to leave the branch but-- but only very, very rare. Well, I'm holding out for that rare instance. Oh, by the way, they deducted the minibar from the Hilton. It wasn't expensed. Oh, give me a break. FICA, Social Security, state tax, HMO are getting rich on me and you won't pay for my mint-- Touchy today, huh? EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Middleman, my immediate supervisor, GS32, but I wish she wouldn't make me pay for my minibar bill. Yesterday's mark gave me grief. Yeah I heard. Very messy. Totally unexpected. He freaked. Eddie, you know, when you first came to my department, we used to talk a lot. You were a lot of fun. Now it's just work, work, work with you. Like I said, I'm saving up. Have a good one. [CHURCH BELL] [DOOR SHUT] [CHURCH BELL] EDDIE: Bless me, father, for I have committed a mortal sin. PRIEST: Confess the sin, son. [CHURCH BELL] EDDIE: I killed a man, father. PRIEST: Not again. EDDIE: Father, I pray for your absolution so that I-- PRIEST: No, no, I'm not doing this, Eddie. EDDIE: Father, I sacrificed the pleasures of my flesh in order that I-- PRIEST: You think this is some kind of game? You can't barter with God, Eddie. You can't trade one for another. God doesn't care if you haven't had sex in a year. EDDIE: It's been three years, three years father. Come on, Jack. PRIEST: Don't call me Jack. I am an instrument of the Lord. EDDIE: Then give me my damn absolution. PRIEST: That's it, Eddie. That's it. Get out. Whatever, Eddie. 20 Hail Mary's and 20 Our Father's. Come on, Jack. No, 30 Our Father's. -30? It's for talking back. Jesus. I'm sorry, what? Nothing. 60. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RINGING] EDDIE (RECORDING): Not in, call back. [BEEP] UNIDENTIFIED FRIEND (RECORDING): Eddie, where you been, man? Pick up. Yo, listen, we're going to Roady's for brewskies. Come join us, all right? I guess he's not there. [BEEP] MOTHER (RECORDING): Edward, it's your mother again. I know you're there. Just treat me like the loving mother that I am. Give me a couple of grandchildren. [BEEP] MIDDLEMAN (RECORDING): Eddie, Middleman. A few of us are getting together tonight. If you'd like to come down, you're more than welcome. You certainly need more in your life than just this job. [TV NOISES] [RINGING] [GRUNT] [RINGING] Hello, Eddie, Middleman. -[GRUNT] I've found a nice woman for you to meet. Oh, no. MIDDLEMAN (ON PHONE): She's a lot of fun. No, no, no. MIDDLEMAN (ON PHONE): Very normal. Someone to talk to. No, I said no. MIDDLEMAN (ON PHONE): Meet her. You don't understand. No. MIDDLEMAN (ON PHONE): Eddie, that's an order. HOST: Yes, ma'am?

No, no, no. Have you known my friend long? No, I just met her at a party. And she knows you're-- Pregnant? Unless she was blind, yeah. I think there's been a mistake. We're-- we're not supposed-- Take off your glasses. If you don't mind, I'd like to see your eyes. Oh, nice. You don't lie, do you. Excuse me? Tell me what you're thinking right now and I want to hear the truth. I'm thinking of leaving. Excuse me. How can you just come out and meet a man in your condition. Have you no shame, woman? You must be seven months-- Eight months. And listen, I've haven't asked to sleep with you-- yet. You are imbalanced and I am taking you home. There is something seriously wrong with you. Come on. Did you drive? -No, no, no. -Give me your keys. -Calm down. -Give me the keys. Did you drive? Oh, you're about to make me have this baby. Wha-wha-wha-what are you talking about? Oh my god. Woo. What? Oh, oh, woo, you're about to make me. -Woo. -Stop it. Woo woo woo woo. [SIGH] Your friend said you needed cheering up. Sit down. shouldn't he sit down? CROWD: Yeah. Come on! Sit down! You like the maternity wear? It's an original, I made it myself. Eddie, nobody is going to kill you if you laugh. Go on. All right, let's go. Move it. [BARK] Come on. [BARK] So you see what a good little animal this is? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a good little animal. Look at him. You're a very good little Felix, aren't you? Yes, you are. We're going to get you a little girlfriend, companionship which is what you need. -Yeah. OK, listen, I want the 411 on the date. How did it go? Fine, she is very cheery. -So what happens next? -Nothing. No more dates. I'm going to push full steam ahead into my work. Oh, don't be so dull. Look, I appreciate what you did with Lois and all, but let's just say in another life. So she rubbed you the wrong way? No, it's not that. It's just that I feel that women-- Oh no, the great mantra of Eddie Jones, the arbiter of women's etiquette. Do you have any advice for the rest of us out there? Eddie. Hi, it's Lois. Where you been? I-I-I-I-I've just been-- Busy? Lame, lame. Come on now. We got along fine, didn't we? -Yeah. Yeah, and you forgave me for that pregnant thing, right? Yes, yes, I did. It's just that I-- Eddie, you were laughing and you needed to, Eddie. I know when a man needs to laugh and you needed to laugh. No, but it's not a problem, Lois. Listen, I've just been real busy and-- I've been running in and out and I'm hungry, I've got to eat. I-I-I-- This is just my way of making up for our abrupt little beginning to our relationship. So, you never told me what kind of work you do. Security. Checking on people's safety? Something like that. I make sure people are taken care of. That's exciting. Ah, depends. You? I'm an office manager. Right now, Pits &amp; Evans accounting, but I freelance. Pits &amp; Evans, that's a big 8 firm. Wow, you know the major players in accounting. That's impressive. I did some business in your building. Well, did you know that I, Lois Newton, may be on a plane to Geneva to open a Pits &amp; Evans office in that city? First time out of Chicago and I'm staying at the Four Seasons too. Not that I love money or anything like that, but I like to afford things, you know, buy nice things. And you're not interested in this, are you? No, no, no. I am, I just-- I've got to get to work. Well take the rest of the pizza, wrap it up. Check please. The night shift can be a bear. Believe me, I know because my first job was on the night shift. Oh, no. I've got it. No, no, no. Ladies don't pay for dinner. I've got it. Thank you so much. Eddie, look, I invited you so I pay. No, no, no. I got it. Eddie, please. I said I got it, OK? I-I-I-I'll call you. I'll call you. -OK. I've heard that before. No, no, no, no. I will. -All right. -Thanks. You're welcome. [RINGING] EDDIE (RECORDING): Not in. Call back. [BEEP] MIDDLEMAN (RECORDING): Eddie, Middleman. You know, I find this whole business of Lois so enchanting-- Middleman? She gets on my nerves. She came to my house tonight. Why did you give her my number and my address? She's harmless and besides, I think she likes you. -No, no, no, no. -All right, fine. Forget it. I mean, if you can't see what a great girl this is, you can just forget it. [DOORBELL] Hold on, somebody is at the door. [SQUEEKING] Your new dog? [SQUEEKING] My cute new vet just arrived with my cute new puppy. He makes house calls. Listen, Eddie, we'll scope out the police job tomorrow, all right? And, listen, you didn't discourage Lois, did you? Middleman-- Well, that's called encouragement. Bye. [KNOCKING] OK. All right. OK. Oh. Ah. What up? It's kind of early, isn't it? Let me see that. Oh. Somebody must love the fuck out of you, man. I don't know nobody that gets flowers this early in the morning. You talk to women with that mouth? That's right. And they fine too, all of them, baby, all of them. Nice bodies, big old legs. Boy, chicken wings. I'm in the wrong neighborhood. EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Eddie, I had a wonderful evening-- LOIS (VOICEOVER): I know you're going to think I say this to all my dates, but when I looked into your eyes, I knew you were someone really special, the kind of guy a girl can really trust. You're late. I do have a life, you know. That sounds promising. Off to church? It keeps me centered. I was particularly centered myself last night. Oh, they're coming out. Take a look. All right, you're a patrolman on the protection detail. Southside. Couple of days, tops. Here's your ID. It's not a great picture. The guy goes in to look at the art, but actually he's selling nuke triggers to the captains who, of course, are on the terrorists' payroll. Needless to say, they are all bad guys. Frank Bonner is bringing in back up from Baltimore. When you get to the front of the museum, take out the guy in plainclothes, go. Oh, and nothing fancy, Eddie. These are Frank's guys and you know they can be a little bit tricky. Oh, I almost forgot. You've got a problem out here. Some FBI agents have been gunned down by a guy with a hard-on for US G men. I'll fax your photo in the morning, but do not-- let me repeat this, do not allow this to interfere with your usual work. He's mine and I want the bonus. Whatever but, look, do me a favor. Don't step on Frank Bonner's toes, huh? You know how catty he gets about who takes credit for the hits. Just do your job and let his team do his, huh? Meeting is going a little long. Should I wait? No, get a coffee. I'll beep you when we're ready. Hey, who's your CO over at the 45th these days? Chief McCan. He's a good guy. Told him I'm going to take his job one day. See you in a bit. Yeah, eagle is flying. He's flying. Roger that. Ready and holding. How many times does he have to come up to me, say one thing, and then-- then he changes his mind. -Oh, guys I'm hungry. -I know he's such an idiot. Well we got some-- You girls want to get some chicken? No, Thai. -Thai food. -Thai. Thai? Thai, let's get Thai. [INAUDIBLE] Eddie? Oh my god. Eddie. I didn't know you were on the force. These are my friends. Girls, this is Eddie. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. We've heard so many nice things about you. What the hell? What is going on over there? What's he doing? Oh, have lunch with us. RADIO: Eagle, the bird is ready to fly. Well, I really do have to walk the beat. I'm-- -Excuse us, girls. Sorry. RADIO: Eagle, come in. Go, go, go, go. Eddie, I've got a hunch. I mean, and it's just a hunch, but I think you saw me and you purposefully walked down here because you really wanted to talk to me. RADIO: Five seconds to position. Am I right? RADIO: Standby. Eagle, Come in. Eagle, do you read me? -What? Where? We lost you. Well, fuck. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. What are we going to do? Hey, hey, hey, hey! [DOOR SHUT] Everything is fucked up. A fact I won't dispute. I needed that job done. EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Taylor, Middleman's boss. He started the Eliminator Corps after leaving the CIA because, as he put it, scum lives among us all. [BREAKING CHINA] Look, [INAUDIBLE] Taylor, Taylor, I am just not in the mood for this right now. I'm serious, bitch. So am I. That's a $40,000 vase that you just broke, the one you were hiding from your wife in the divorce settlement. Oh, shit. That vase? Yes, you ignoramus. What do you think this is? Some Tom Clancy novel? Hey, I'm quite upset. No kidding. I've got a dead under-under-undersecretary. The guy who did it is running loose. Now I've got an eliminator who missed his routine hit. What the hell is going on here? Simple lapse of concentration. What concentration? I'm losing money. Yeah, well, eliminators are human. Fuck human. I don't hire human. I hire hard, cold, eliminators. Sounds to me like you're up for promotion or your alimony is due or you want to [INAUDIBLE]. This is simple, basics, 101. You know how goddamn bad I look right now? [LAUGHTER] Celibate-- Please, keep your voice down. Please. Thank you. You know, I always thought you were a little odd for an Eliminator, but that's OK. Maybe you were just a lonely guy, you know, only do it in the house with the porno tapes sort of guy, but celibacy-- I mean, never in a million years. I'm the best. You'll never find anybody as good as me. Eddie, I always liked you. Middleman, you remember the day you sort of came on to me? That was to completely professionally. We used to talk a lot, but after that day I said it was best to simply do the job. Fine. You want to play by the rules? So can I. You missed a hit. That means the next three are for you. What? Check your handbook-- page 95, section C15 7A. It's as clear as the page it's printed on. The rule at this moment is being enforced. She kissed me. Lois was in the way. I don't care who kissed who. You were on a job. A rule is a rule. She's your friend. You tell her to back off. You tell yourself. Haven't ever been in a relationship before? This is not a relationship. Well, who knows? Maybe you never have. [RINGING] EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Not in. Call back. MOTHER (RECORDING): Eddie, it's your mother. Mark mentioned you have a girlfriend. So when do I meet her? I expect to see her here for Thanksgiving. [BEEP] -Martin. [RINGING] Not in, call back. [BEEP] MIDDLEMAN (RECORDING): Eddie, Middleman. That fax I mentioned is coming right now. [KNOCKING] 19, 20. Oh. All right, all right, all right. Oh, God. Hey. What you doing in here? EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Martin, eliminator, sex machine. Why did you tell my mother? Hey, you missed the hit. Bad news travels fast. RADIO: Not the hit, the girl. You know my mom bugs me about grandkids. Girlfriend is a good thing. And you work too much. You know, your mother worries about you, I worry about you. Just calm down. -I'm calm. -You're calm? -I am calm. -You're calm? You look calm. -I'm calm. She's not my girlfriend. -OK. -She's-- -All right, whatever. [DOOR SHUT] Is the game on? I don't know. Don't cook. I'm taking you out. You're taking me out? Yeah, it's on me. Here's the deal. Frank wants you back in the department. -Mmm. -No, no, no. He knows he said a few inappropriate things to you in the past, but-- -Inappropriate? He was downright rude. Eddie, come on, you're the best. Frank's group has got the juice. Frank wants a trophy. I'm not going back to be his trophy. You're on probation. That means no paycheck. Frank will pay you. Loyalty counts for something. I work for Middleman now. I don't know, Eddie. People are beginning to think you're a little unreliable these days. What? Well, you've got the missed hit, now a new girlfriend? What did I tell you? She's not my girlfriend. Oh, come on. You were kissing her in the street. Well, why does she have to be anything? Because it's not done. Do you see me kissing all the honies on the street? No. OK, listen. Frank insulted me. I'm not going back, period, end of story. All right, so you insult him right back by going to work for Middleman? I mean, Frank has got feelings too, you know. And you guys used to be friends. You need a paycheck. And Frank is having a party tonight. I'm not saying go kiss his ass or anything, but-- well, if I were you-- [DIAL TONE] [RINGING] Yes? -Lois? -Eddie? Oh, Eddie! Did you know there is a man just like you in this book I'm reading right now? Really? Yes. He's quiet, he's sensitive, he's steadied, and his eyes are beautiful just like yours. FEMALE VOICE: Is that for me? So what happened to you the other day? Police work, police work. Lois, is that for me? Hey! Shh! I got it. So Eddie, were you thinking about me? Lois, Lois, are you busy tonight-- busy tonight? No. Well, I was just asking because there is a party tonight. I was just wondering, if you-- do you want to go? Yes. Yes I'll go with you. -Half an hour. I'll be there in half an hour. OK? I'll be ready at seven. Bye, Lois. And that was my second dog, but I was so shocked because I didn't know dogs could get bladder infections. But you know what? Everything worked out-- --[INAUDIBLE] Lois, I need you to do me a favor. You know that this guy used to be my boss so you don't have to-- You want me to shut up? I didn't say that. Yeah, but you wanted to, you wanted to. I won't embarrass you, Eddie. Don't forget, I have been trained in a strong, corporate environment. Nice place. -Very nice. Hey, good to see you again. -[INAUDIBLE] more than you. -Hi. EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Frank Bonner, GS32. 32 Frank is the new golden boy, much loved in Washington. Eddie, what the fuck are you doing here? My god, it's been a long time. Martin said you might show up, but you never know, you know? Hey how's your mom? Frank, this is Lois. Ah, yes. I've heard a lot about you. I like her. Come on in, come on in. We have some great food, some good liquor, and for a change, just the right Gold Coast crowd. Everybody GS15 and up. And everyone knows there's nothing worse than a government worker on a Friday night. That's our dance. [LAUGHTER] You remembered. Lois, would you excuse me and Eddie for just a few minutes? Oh my goodness, Frank, I had no idea. This is really nice. I'm impressed. Oh, thank you. I was-- I was up all night. I couldn't sleep and you know I sleep like a baby. What do you think the problem is, Frank? Well, I stood in front of the mirror and I said to myself, Franklin Ezekiel Bonner, you have to apologize to Eddie Jones for what you said. He was your best men and he left you. And now you have to make it right. It's all right. It's in the past. Eddie, please, please, I've got to do this. Eddie, I'm sorry. I never meant to call you a fucking asshole celibate nigger I was in the moment. I needed a V8, a hit of reefer, something. I was upset and I'm sorry. Calling you a celibate asshole is the worst thing a guy can say to another guy. Well, glad I got that off my chest. Do you accept my apology? Frank-- Come on. [GROAN] [SIGH] [GUNSHOT] EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Frank and I never really saw eye to eye. So, do you like working for Middleman? She's fair, but a government gig is still a-- a government gig. Well, fair is all that really matters around here. Nice break, Frank. Looks like I'm solids. That group is fun. What rank is she? Who does she work for? Frank, actually, she-- Lois-- Eddie, Eddie. Would you mind if I take a little spin with Lois? Wow. Lois is hot and, you know, not hot hot, but hot. You know what I mean? Ms. Newton? [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] -Let's talk [INAUDIBLE]. -Beautiful! Woo. Thank you. You are a wonderful dancer, Mr. Bonner. Oh, thank you, Lois. Please call me Frank. So I hear you work mostly in the business world. Well, Frank, I work in the private consulting business, but I have handled direct orders and contracts from the government. So you work in the private sector too? Interesting. Yeah, mostly freelance. Well, how many contracts do you handle a year? 30, maybe 35. 35 contracts a year? Why have I never heard of you? I don't know, sir-- I mean, Frank. A lot of folks in the community are secretive. You know how competitive this world is and a lot of people are intimidated by women who can outperform them, but I get pretty good marks. And as they say, the only good mark is a dead mark. OK, I guess you're right, sir. I mean, Frank. I like you. Lois, I want you to see somebody in the city for me at a major accounting firm. I need a real deal closer on this one. Sure, no problem. What do you want me to do? It's kind of a delicate job, a lot of people around. I need you to go in, take a look around and, you know, cancel the contract. Oh, you mean like a secret audit? [LAUGHTER] Yeah, an audit. I like that. An audit. [LAUGHTER] I must say you were really wonderful this evening, truly magnificent and I thank you. Thank you. I think I get it from my daddy-- God rest his soul. He taught me how to dance. Did he? Really? Yeah. I remember when I was a little girl my dad would come home from work in the summer and he would grab me and my mom and the boombox and we'd go to the park for a picnic. And just before the sun would go down, he would turn the music up real loud and we'd do the hustle or the electric slide, and before we knew it, he would have everybody in the park on their feet dancing, doing the electric slide. Can you imagine that? 100 people doing a line dance. No. Oh, once we were doing this pied piper thing and everybody was following my dad around. We almost got hit by an ice cream truck. [LAUGHTER] I'm sorry, no. I don't mean to laugh, but-- but it's-- [LAUGHTER] it's funny, the way you said it. [LAUGHTER] Do you know that's the first time I ever heard you laugh? You'd be surprised what you might find. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll be right back. I'm sorry I slept all the way. I'm usually more fun on long rides. Well, that's OK. Eddie, do I have sleep in my eye? Nuh-uh. Are you sure? Come close. No, you don't have sleep. Come inside, Eddie. You have to work tomorrow and so do I. Yeah, but work is a pain in the butt. Let's both be late. Well, thank you for a very nice evening. I-I-I-I'll call you. Eddie? You're not just going to leave me standing here like this. Eddie, I am hot, very, very hot. [DOOR SHUT] How was it? Girl, you just don't know. I know I don't know. That's why I asked, how was it? I just want to go to sleep so I can remember every single part of it. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. [SCREAMING] Hi, Maggie, it's Lois. [COUGHING] Oh, yeah. I'm very sick. No, i won't be in today, but I need you to make sure you order the new paper for the IBM machines and make sure the workstations are online today. That's today, Maggie. Thank you. Of course I freelance, Mr. Bonner. I'm the best freelance accontant in Chicago. Girl, it's time to make some extra money. You go girl! [DIAL TONE] [RINGING] EDDIE (RECORDING): Not in. Call back. [HEAVY BREATHING] MOTHER (RECORDING): Edward, it's your mother, call me. [GRUNT] [KNOCKING] Oh! Man, women coming out of the woodwork for you, man. Are you getting all the women? Can you save some women for the rest of us, man? Get out of my house. Get out. Bro, we want some booty too. Get out. Come on, man, what's up? Hey, you've got all the women. Oh, lord. Eddie, I had a wonderful evening. Lois. [RINGING] Wait here, Mr. Jensen will see you soon. OK, thank you. -Lois Newton to see you. -All right. Yeah? What? -I'm Lois Newton. -Yeah? I'm representing Frank Bonner. Can we talk in your office? Frank Bonner sent you? Yes sir, Mr. Jenson, he certainly did. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I-I-I-- oh please. I am so sorry. -OK. -[SCREAM] -[SCREAM] -[SCREAM] -[SCREAM] -[SCREAM] [SCREAMING] What did I do? What did I do wrong? Was my skirt to short? No, no. I didn't even wear high heels today. It's a black thing. That's it. That's it. It's a black thing. [DIAL TONE] Eddie, I really messed up today. Frank gave me this freelance job and the guy wouldn't even see me. I didn't even get to work. I am really upset. I'm going to go drinking. Could you just meet me at this-- Lois. Oh, Eddie. Lois, I need to know, who did you go see? Oh, forget about that, Eddie. Maybe I just wasn't cut out for freelance. I knew I should have listened to my horoscope today. I should have gone to work. That guy really deflated my ego. Lois, what was his name? I need to know. Excuse me, but I'm having a moment here, Eddie. Mr. Jenson. I just came in and he just ran off. OK, maybe it was my outfit. Maybe it was my hair. You know what I really think it was? I think it was a black thing and he just freaked out like we can't do this job too. -Come on. Where are we going? Come on, we're going home. Eddie, I didn't pay for my drink. Go, go, go. Frank, what's going on? Why did you send Lois after Jenson? FRANK (ON PHONE): Whoa, whoa. Eddie, slow down. This is outside business. Oh I forgot, right, you're the boyscout, right? You don't wet your beak like the rest of us, huh? Look, Lois aside, I have everything under control here. All right? Oh, shit. Eddie, hang on, hang on. Eddie? EDDIE (ON PHONE): Lois is a civilian, Frank. Martin said your girl was a professional. Martin is an idiot. I can't believe this. Frank, she thought she was there to do an audit for a corporate account. Come on, come on, it's a misunderstanding. No one has to know. I'll make it up to you. What do you say? Name your price, name your vice. The secretaries in this department are incredible. Secretaries? What are you talking about? Are you telling me you've got agents doing unauthorized marks? Next thing I know you'll be telling me you're behind the FBI hits. Frank? Frank? Why? Everyone's got something, Eddie. This is not a big deal. Eddie? What? FRANK (ON PHONE): Do not make this a problem, Eddie. Are you on board? Eddie? Eddie? Eddie? Eddie, what's going on? FRANK (ON PHONE): Goddamn it, Eddie. [PHONE BEEPING] Please sit Lois. Thank you. You thirsty? Oh, yeah, sure. Thank you. -You're welcome. Lois, Mr. Jensen is dead. He was a drugs smuggler, an arms dealer, and a friend of terrorists, a guy nobody liked. I work for the US government. So does Frank, Martin, and everyone else at the party the other night. So-- We're eliminators. We dispose of people the government doesn't want to deal with anymore, sort of like internal national security. You mean you kill people? For the government. There's a difference. [SOBBING] Damn. [KNOCKING] I left my purse. I hate myself. Don't say that. There's no way you could have known anything about me. When your friend told me at that party that you were a nice, quiet guy who wanted to meet a nice girl from the Southside I was excited and I didn't expect anything. I thought I'd meet you and you'd be this smug guy who didn't have time for a girl like me, but then you laughed, Eddie. Outside you were hard, with dark glasses on, but inside you were so warm, so real. And I hate myself. I hate myself because I feel so much for you and you don't feel a thing for me. Look at me. I came running back here all desperate and wishing. I saw [INAUDIBLE]. I knew this could happen, but you're not gay, Eddie, you're not a drug dealer, you're not an ex con, you're not a player. You're some legal murderer and it's too late. It's too late, Eddie, because I am-- I am so in love with you. Stay. Oh, boy. Because I think I love you. Oh, Eddie. You-- you're not scared of me? Well, it looks like you're a tidy man. You know I don't like messy men in my life. Come here, Eddie. This is nice. -Thank you. Is everything OK? Yes, great. Good Snapple too. Ow, Eddie. Not so rough. I can't do this. Can't do what? I'm just celibate. -You're lying. -No. You want to talk about it? How about a beer? You-you want a beer? No, Eddie, I think that you talk about this. No, no, no. Eddie, I mean this does affect our relationship. I don't want to talk about it. But Eddie, not having sex is serious. I enjoy having sex. This is pressure, Lois. Are you pressuring you me for sex? No. I just need to know why it is that-- I don't need any pressure, OK? I get enough pressure every single day. OK, no pressure. OK. OK. I just have one question. What? Eddie, why? You're a grown man. Lois, I was raised with religion. My parents thought of me becoming a teacher, a scientist, maybe even a priest, but as a child I wanted to make a difference in the world. Then one day, something happened. It felt wrong. So I made a deal with God-- To not have sex? [RINGING] [RINGING] MOTHER (RECORDING): Edward, how is it going with the new girlfriend? [BEEP] Baby. Let's forget about this. Yeah? Yeah. I mean, since we're not going to get busy-- Busy, yeah. Let's do something fun. Let's go downtown and see a show. -Yeah. -Yeah. What? Go home, Lois. I'll call you later. EDDIE: Come on, man. Follow that car. -FBI. -All right. -I believe this is yours. -Ah. Job well done. [GUNSHOT] Let's go. Listen to me. The state has upped the anti. They're offering cash, a promotion to GS24 and a mark-free trip to Costa Rica. Now this whole thing doesn't even seem worth it anymore. GS24, that's $78,500 a year, a trip to Costa Rica. This isn't like you, Eddie. What is it? I'm tired. Father, you've spoken to me before. I followed your rules from altar boy to seminary-- all right, all right, I didn't finish that, but I need your guidance now. My plan was a simple one-- work for my country, make a good living, find the right girl. I need to know, is she the one? [CHURCH BELLS] Hey, Eddie. Hey, how you doing? I didn't deserve a pop in the grill like that, Eddie. That for telling Frank that Lois worked for the department. I was trying to help you out. Do me a favor. Stop trying to do stuff for me. I will always do stuff for you. You're my Obi Wan, man. Leave it alone. Your problem, you work too much. Yeah, that's me. Will somebody get this guy some booty? What? [INAUDIBLE] It's hot in here. Some booty. I wonder where he got that from. [KNOCKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] What's up, dog? [INAUDIBLE] my gun. More flowers for the most popping motherfucker I know. Later, man. LOIS (VOICEOVER): I had a great day yesterday. Maybe you don't feel it, mister government man, the way I feel it for you, but I just know one thing. I love you, but if it's not the same with you, there is nothing more to say. Lois. [DOORBELL] EDDIE: Is Lois here? Come on in. Hi, Amy. Hi. Good to see you again. You too. Nice flowers. Eddie? Lois, I know what I want. I love you. -Really? Yeah. This is what I want. Michigan? It's paradise, simple life. Come away with me, Lois, you and me together. OK. Really? Yeah. Wow. Oh, wait a minute. What am I going to tell the guys at work? Tell them you went fishing and in the process, bam, you got married. [SQUEEK] Lois, will you marry me? Yes, yes. Oh, oh, Eddie. [SCREAM] [SCREAM] Oh, Amy, I'm getting married, girl. I'm getting married. Good, means there's more room around here for me. [LAUGHTER] Yes! Yeah! I've got to call my mama. Eddie, come here, come here. You have to talk to my mama. Ms. Newton. Mom, it's Edward. I'm in love and I'm about to get married. I hope this makes you happy. I'll be in touch. Love you. The ring is a symbol of continuity, unbroken faith, and eternal love. Edward Tarleton Jones, you may now kiss the bride, Lois Isabelle Newton. Oh. Oh, Eddie. Oh, why did you tell me? What have you got against waiting? Are we going through that again? An eliminator out of contact for 48 hours is officially AWOL. Face it, Eddie is gone. Well, why do we have to play it so much by the book. Look, why can't you forget your goddamn promotion for one second. Eddie is my best employee. What do you think I'm running here? Some chicken shit operation? We are accountable for every one of our people-- each and every one of them. We are accountable for their actions and the actions of those that they have to deal with. We are all needed and we are all expendable. You got it? That's the way it's written. Now, you can handle this in a timely manner or-- All right. I want progress reports on his movements all written up and on my desk 12 hours after he goes down. Understand? -Yes sir. Poor Eddie. Eddie Jones has to be taken out. If the girl is in your sights, don't hesitate. We have to assume he has told her everything. Find him and hit him. This is a little irregular. Any problems? No problem at all. Eddie is now live so check your scanners, find his coordinates. He is two days away. Hit every church, bridal and tux shop in a thousand mile radius. What the fuck is going on? That's the order. He's out. Go get him. Eddie is the best eliminator I've ever known, Frank. What is this? He didn't come in the house when the street lights came on. Get it done, Martin. You OK? I am never playing matchmaker again. You need to know how to do this. They're not going to give up trying to find us. Let's just go, Eddie. I don't want to know how to do this. You need to learn. Anything could happen. Right over here. Actually, step back. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] OK, here you go. -Oh, Eddie. -Come on, baby. Come on. Aim at that little can right there. [GUNSHOT] Oh, I don't want to do this. Come on, baby, you've got to learn. Come on. Come on. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Oh, I did it. Let's do it again. No, no, no, no, no. You got it. You wanted it. I can't wait. Uh huh. This is so beautiful. OK. Here, here, here. Before you go, let me do this little thing here. There you go. That's all I want to do. You're so strong, Eddie. Well, I do work out a little bit. Eddie Jones. You blew it. [GUNSHOT] LOIS: Oh my god. MARTIN: Let him go! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Hey! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUSNHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Martin! Martin, my man. [LAUGHTER] -Hey. You know I wasn't going to let them take you out, Obi Wan. [LABORED BREATHING] His name is Eddie Jones and he is a non-debriefed eliminator. He has to be taken out and he is a killing machine. I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK. Just-- get out of here, Eddie. Just get out of here because-- -I'm not going to leave you. -They know my location. They can just pick me up, just get out of here, go. I'm not leaving-- Eddie, go! Hey, hey, hey-- Eddie is very skilled. He is also a very nice man who cares and he's in love with a woman. I introduced them. I [INAUDIBLE] made the whole thing possible, you know. They are just wonderful together as a couple. I mean, I would just-- I would so hate-- Hey, Middleman! Enough. That Lois, she's a-- she really loves you, man. Keep her. I will. I will. [GEESE QUACKING] [GUNS LOADING] [BRANCH CRACKING] It's not over. I know exactly how it's going to happen. There's no time, honey. No time. They're here. Well, what do you want me to do, Eddie? Move! [GUNSHOT] [BREAKING GLASS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Eddie! Eddie! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GROAN] [HEAVY BREATHING] [BREAKING GLASS] [HEAVY BREATHING] [GUNSHOT] [BREAKING GLASS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Eddie! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAM] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [HEAVY BREATHING] [COCKING PISTOL] Drop the gun now. Mister killing machine, you won't walk away from this today. It's time to cleanse your soul. Get on your knees, Eddie Jones. Take out your rosary. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. And give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. [GUNSHOT] [GROAN] -Lois! -What? -Nothing. -What? Nothing, nothing. Come here, come here. [GROAN] It's over, baby. It's over. MIDDLEMAN (VOICEOVER): Taylor, you'll be satisfied to know that the case of Edward Farmington Jones is now closed. Eddie was killed in a fierce gun battle along with six other agents. I personally supervised the disposal of all the bodies. I'll send this report along to Frank for his perusal. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] EDDIE (VOICEOVER): Lois and I, well, we finally got busy. And thanks to Middleman, we went on to have a pretty fine life. [LAUGHTER] You know, Eddie? Hm? You're the perfect guy. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] I love you. [INAUDIBLE] Want to try [INAUDIBLE] Oh, it's going to be a long night. [MUSIC PLAYING]
