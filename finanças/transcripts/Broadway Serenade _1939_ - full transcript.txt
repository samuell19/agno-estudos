He might have put her eye out. You'd have done the same thing yourself, Mr. Parks. I'd what? Listen, sister. I charge a 2-buck cover here and the customers are beginning to feel that's just a little too much to pay for a punch in the nose. I tell you what let's do. Let's all three of us promise never, never to mention this ugly episode again. What do you say? Yeah, let's vote on it. Majority rules. Listen, Seymour, you're through. That's final. - You can stay, if you want to. - Mm-hmm. We're a team. Alright, have it your own way. Don't think it wasn't fun just because it wasn't. - How's that? - Jimmy, don't argue. Well, Hale and Seymour, those gifted entertainers are at liberty again. - On the button. - Yeah. 1,111 consecutive throws without a miss. Twelve, if you please, Mr. Seymour. Twelve. I should've remembered. The only thing I do well. Oh, nonsense, Jimmy. Yes, Jimmy. You have other talents. You've done wonders in never accomplishing anything worth anyone's notice and you've developed such a genius for gumming up your stupid life that sometimes I wish somebody would take a crack at your-- (Mary) 'Jimmy'' Here, have a cigarette. You know, it's the same thing as counting ten. Only easier. Mm-hmm. I get it. Now, how do you feel? Well...I feel unemployed. James Geoffrey Seymour. Graduate of three great musical conservatories. Piano virtuoso, master of counterpoint. Most promising student of his class. How can you let a little incident like this touch you? Why don't make copy for your press agents when you're rich and famous? The early struggles of a great composer. You know, I'm beginning to like having you for a wife. Oh, you are. [tinkling music] Gee, it plays well. For a juggler, you're the clumsiest I ever saw. Oh, you.. And lay off the refreshments. Mrs. Olsen, I just saw Mary and Jimmy coming down street. Gee, it's awful early. I hope nothing's happened. - Merry Christmas, Mrs. Olsen. - What? Again? Now, don't scold. We were fired in the name of fair play. Sounds to me like Jimmy won another fight. Mrs. Olsen. The psychic landlady. Oh, pooh. Say, Jimmy, there's a letter upstairs for you from Italy. Italy. Make way for my ship, she may be coming in now. Well, hurry back down, 'cause we're having Toms and Jerries. - Tom and Jerries? - Come, Mary. Alright. Jimmy, bring our presents down so we can put them under the tree. Herman. - Mary, my liebchen. - Herman, you work too hard. Only $2 for a whole night's copying. I know, but it's extra money. Besides, it buys new strings to Oscar. Listen to Oscar. He was singing good tonight. That's not what I wanted to play at all. Ah, that Backspiegel's Hofbrau makes me crazy. All they ask for in that eating place is "The Blue Danube." I play "Blue Danube" so much, I'm getting blue in the face. It's good for you the Black Bottom's out of date. (Jimmy) 'Mary, Mary.' Boy, oh, boy. Hello, Herman, season's greetings. Season greetings to you. - What is-- - Listen, lamb chop. Do you remember that wonderful romantic honeymoon we never had? I remember it as though it were tomorrow. - It is tomorrow. - What? (Herman) 'Please, plain English is hard enough. Please.' Well, Herman, in plain English, the astounding, amazing unbelievable news is that I've won the Davelli Fellowship. "A year's study in Italy under Davelli himself "plus $500 for expenses. "The most distinguished piece of musical composition offered by one of the new American composers of 1938." Do I see him with whom I was acquainted when he was poor and unsuccessful? That same Jimmy Seymour? Then may I, may I, may I. Oh, it's the most beautiful sentence I've ever read. Imagine, Mary. A year of sun and wine and music and old ruins and olive groves and, and you. Every dream we've ever had. But only $500 for two people for a whole year. Do you-- We'll earn the difference, darling. All we'll need will be about $1000. We'll live like two canaries on a twig and, and you'll cook over a gas jet. Thousand dollars? Oh, it might as well be a million. No, I'll get it. I'll sell a song. Forgive me for pointing, so far all that your songs ever earned is a dollar and eighty-five cents. Yes, I finally found what was wrong with them. They're too good. That's what's wrong with them. You would think that. It just seems to me that everyone in the world today is awfully busy and upset. People are worrying a lot and working a lot-- The most of them are just worrying. Maybe, but anyway, they don't have the time to learn to like new melodies. What they want is an old melody in modern dress.

Years ago, oh, about a hundred years ago, there was a shepherd on a hillside and he was feeling rather lonely and blue so he began singing about the way he felt. [operatic voice] Then another shepherd heard him and liked it. Gradually, it became a folk song. Then a man named Tchaikovsky heard it. And he took it and dressed it up in the style of his period. Then I came along, and I dressed it up for 1939. Oh, I-I have some music. - And some word. - Are they any good? Don't know. I wrote them. Will you sing for me, Mary? Sure.

You've got influence. Why don't you get us in? - Sure. - Oh, please don't, Miss Judy. - It's what it's there for. - Yes, I know, but.. Say, what's going on in there, anyway? (Mr. Collier) 'I don't want to be disturbed.' I'm attending to some very important business. Now don't interrupt me again. (female #1) 'Very well, Mr. Collier.' Did I seem cross? I was only putting it on, you know. Oh, I see through you, Mr. Collier. Way down deep, you're just as sweet as you can be. Oh, am I? I mean do you think... That's nice. That's why you understand how I feel about this costume. Yes. Now, for instance this sort of thing. Well, no girl has a.. No modern girl is shaped like that. Oh, eh. Ha-ha ha-ha. There's no doubt about it. But the costume from the bathing number that I'm not in gives a young lady a chance to show it, if she has a worthwhile form like I. Oh, yes. I have crosses, no question. So, so I thought I'd slip it on to to show you what I mean. Yes. Oh, no. You can't. This is, this is no place for-- Don't be silly, Mr. Collier. It's your business. It's not my business, you can't, oh.. Well, hurry up, if, if, oh.. Now, don't you think it's a crime for a girl to hide her form, if it's really a nice one, Mr. Collier? Oh, uh. Well yes, I... No, you better hide it. Here, now put the dress on, because anybody, somebody, oh.. [mumbling] How to win friends and influence people. Oh, now, Judith, you mustn't misunderstand. Of course not. I know how these things happen. She's probably from a nudist's camp and just dropped in to use the phone. Now, don't be evil minded, Judy. I was just asking Mr. Collier to okay this costume. Remember what I said I'd do the next time you tried to steal a gentleman friend of mine? Don't you dare lay a hand on me. I wouldn't think of it. - Ah. - Sorry. She burned me. Now, you'll always be known as Scarface. Judith, that was... you shouldn't have done that. That, that, that's... the char, it's terrible. That will show in the bathing suit number. Don't worry if it shows where I burned her the police will close the show. - I'll get them after you. - No, no. What for? Defacing public property? - Why, you. - Here now, wait a minute. Here, stop girls, you-- [intercom buzzing] I'll be.. - Yes. - 'Mr. Bryant is here.' Mr. Bryant? Show him in, for heaven sake show him in. Girls, I'm going to be very busy now, please. You'll have to run along. I've got so much work to do. I don't know whether I'm coming or I've left. Oh, why Mr. Bryant. I always seem to be bumping into you. It must be fate. Uh-uh. Trapping's over for today, dear. Scat. Keep my memory green, Cornelius. I'll see you later. Uh...oh yes, I'm afraid she will. Having a little "off with old, on with new" trouble? - Yes, you know how it is. - No. How is it? It's awful. But it's a lot of fun. [intercom buzzing] Oh. Yes?

[all speak] 'Just a minute. One at a time, please.' (male #1) Will you okay these bills? Mr. Bryant will take care of those. (male #2) Look at this layout. It's a knockout. When will you check those costumes? They're waiting. When I can. I can't be everywhere. What's this? It's special drop for, New York opening. What do you think of it, Larry? Why should I? So you can see where your money goes. [laughing] 'What is it? Uh..' Who are you? What are you doing? What do you want? - I'm Joey, the Jinx. - Well? I'm Jinx Artist, see. Look, I got the evil eye. Stop that. Sorry, my show is full, I can't use you. You better use me. I put the eye on Cubs when they played Yanks. Put it on War Admiral when he ran against Sea Biscuit. I put it on Congress when they debated Government Re-organization Bill. I never miss, see. I got evil eye, I got it good. Now I'm putting it in theatrical business. I tell you my cast is all filled up. It's what you think. 50 bucks a week, I put the I in your show. - Help, get this eye outta here. - Come on, let's go. That settles it. You're cooked. You're gonna get hexed. Your show's gonna flop. From now on, it's trouble. Good luck quit and bad luck double, hi-de-hi. [laughing] - Yes. - So, this is show business. Oh, I.. [intercom buzzing] What is it? (male #3) 'Want to look at high flying set?' No, later. Put a jinx on Congress about all they need. The evil eye. Did you hear that? "From now on trouble. Good luck quit, bad luck double. " Don't say it, gives me goose pimples. - Sorry. - Let me see the sketches. Larry, don't go away. Look at these.

I'm leaving for Atlantic City this afternoon. [chatting continues] I beg your pardon. You wanted to see Mr. Collier? Oh, yes. If you please. Ah, Mr. Seymour has a song. A song? Fine.

If this is gonna be, an interview let's get away from the mob. - Let's go in the next room. - Yeah. Come on. Come along, chief, will you? [door shuts] - What is your favorite opera? - Miss, sit down right there. - Boys, take it easy. - How did you get this chance? You'll each get an angle. Please be patient and listen. Get your pencils and paper and here we go. Mr. Collier and Bryant, were in a taxicab. This bus passed them in the opposite direction. There was a girl sitting upstairs singing. They heard her sing just one note. They knew, she was the one for this show. Right, Mr. Collier? The finger of fate in form of bus. Nice angle. Lot of color there. Mary, your call just came. You can take it there. Oh, thank you. Hello? Mary, How are you, darling? I had a hard time getting. How did the show go? Oh, it was a big success. And Mr. Bryant said tonight, I may have another number in Pittsburgh. Oh, that's fine. Where are you? Where are you talking from? I-I'm in Mr. Bryant's apartment. I'm being interviewed. Oh. Oh, I see. Wh-what's the matter, darling? You sound funny. I didn't mean to. I have so much to tell you. So much to talk about. I want to talk to you too. 'Tell me, how much longer will you be gone?' 'Oh, we're going to be four more weeks on the road.' Four weeks? I'll write you every day. Hurry up. Tell him, to read it in the papers. You can read it in the morning. Darling, I can't talk any longer now. I'll write you a long letter tonight. Goodbye. Goodbye, Jimmy. Let's go. 'Thanks very much, Miss Hale. We'll get more later.' Say, who's this Jimmy? Ah, Jimmy... Jimmy, that's her brother. - He's been sick in bed. - Yes, that's right. Don't I get a moment alone with you? Oh well, I thought this was sort of a business int-- Oh, I see. So, I get the business. No. Hardly that, but well, it is rather late. Just for a moment, on the balcony. Look, it's a wonderful night. Well...alright. Just for a moment. Good. I knew you couldn't be that mean. Oh...isn't the air fresh and clean? Mm-hmm. Look at the ocean. The breakers are like lace. Yes. As I've only got a minute, think I'd better get to point. Which is? - You don't like me, do you? - Why do you say that? This is the first time I've managed to get you alone. I'm not very familiar with American behavior yet but I think you've been avoiding me. Have you? - Uh-huh. - Why? Because I think a girl can tell when a man's about to tell her something she doesn't wanna hear. - What, for instance? - Please. - I'm being honest with you. - So you are. And I'll be honest with you. I was gonna say it. I am gonna say it. I could fall in love if you gave me half a chance. I may, anyway. Mr. Bryant, I'm married. Oh...happily? Completely. Well, why did you keep it a secret? Because, we found it more difficult for a married couple to get bookings. I see. Well, the night doesn't seem quite as wonderful as it was. Hmm, I'm sorry. - Forget what I said. - It's forgotten. 'Hold it, please.' Don't move. We got you! Listen fellas, you're making a mistake. - Good night, Mr. Bryant. - But Mary.

Haven't we had enough of that oompah music? I got a radio program I'd like to listen to. Yeah, Mr. Woods. Right away. That will do boys, have your dinner now. (male radio voiceover) 'By a major combine to flood the country with propaganda' 'about a recently invented patent drink.' 'This new thirst quencher will be known as Glug.' 'However, Rogers, in an exclusive interview' 'stated that he had not signed the contract.' 'Flash! It's twins at the Steven Archers.' 'Flash! This office has definite information' 'that the Johnson kidnappers will be caught in 24 hours.' 'Flash! One rising young singer in Cornelius Collier's new sho'' 'is holding hands with one rich Englishman.' 'Maybe, that's the reason she's rising, eh?' 'At any rate, they're on fire.' 'Flash! Further information has just reached this office' 'to the effect that..' Hey, you! I was listening to that. Lay off of it! Hey! That commentator is a friend of mine. You oughta choose your friends more carefully. - What's that? - You heard me! What's with you? Firstly, he's a rat, and secondly, he's a liar. Jimmy! [commotion] You're really looking for a fight! Come on. Come on. Please, Mr. Woods. I'll take care of this. Look here, you-- It's alright, Mr. Bachspiegal, I resign. Wait a minute. Mr. Bachspiegal, don't fire Jimmy. It'll make him feel bad. Include yourself out of this, Herman. Get up and play some music. Otto! Mr. Bachspiegal, I warn you. If you fire Jimmy, I quit too. Okay. Thank you. Auf wiedersehen! Ladies and gentlemen, please excuse. Music. I'm sorry, Herman. I'm certainly great luck to my partners. Don't be sorry, we'll get another job. Oh, sure, we will get another job. What I'm sorry about is that I'm such a heel from the ground up. Five words on the radio, and I start a fight. For what? Because I'm afraid, I guess. But what are you afraid of? Things I don't believe. Well, don't believe them, then. Stop fighting about nothing. Holding hands...on fire! All, lot of lies! Of course, they are. Why do you worry yourself? When a fellow's standing still, getting nowhere in a hurry someone he loves starts going up starts belonging to the world, then then every headline becomes the handwriting on the wall. Wall? What wall? Where? All the walls. All over town. Ah! Mary don't belong to the world. She belongs to you and always will. Listen to me. What you've gotta do is stop inventing trouble. Meet Mary at the train Friday, step right up to her-- I know, with a smile that big and a bouquet...that big. (Bill) C'mon, Mary. C'mon over here, dear. Mary Hale, the gentlemen of the press. Go to work, Mary. Mr. Bryant and Mr. Collier. Mr. Bryant, Mr. Collier. - Do you mind? - Thank you. - Scram, will you? - Yeah. Mind if I get another one with Ms. Hale alone? Thank you. - Jimmy! - I'll introduce you to her. - Jimmy. - 'Who's that mug?' That's her brother. Just out of hospital. - Glad to see you. - Here, I brought a bunch-- - Oh, violets. How sweet. - I wish they were emeralds. (male #3) 'Here they are, sir.' (Mary) Did you miss me while I was gone? Mr. Bryant? Excuse me, please. Let me take them with this picture. It's much prettier. Sorry, old-timer. Hold these, will you? Go ahead. (reporter #1) Big smile now. Mr. Madison of the Morning Star, Ms. Hale. - How do you do? - How do you do? Talk while you're going up the platform. Come along. A lotta fitting to do. (Jimmy) 'Yes, I'm coming.' (Bill) 'Say, get Mr. Collier's and Mr. Bryant's car, will you'' Well, thanks, Ms. Hale. Thanks, Bill. Thanks Danny. Seeya at the hotel. - Let me have those. - And my bags, Bill? - I'll send them up with Kitty. - Well, where's my car, Bill? Grab yourself a taxi. The joint's full of them. - Who might Kitty be? - Oh, my maid, if you please. Well, Ms. Bernhardt. If all negotiations are finished, shall we call a cab? - Sure. - Taxi. Wait. You won't need a taxi. I've got my car. I'll drop you. Oh, I-I-I'm afraid we're not going your way. Oh, Yes. My apartment's near Winchester. Come along. Here. - Winchester? - Yes, darling. Mr. Collier got me an apartment just for today. I've got fittings, and appointments. (Jimmy) But Mrs. Olsen and everybody.. (manager) Uh, take them over there. [romantic music] (Mary) Oh, right on the button. - Darling. - Oh. I hope you'll find everything quite satisfactory. - Quite. Thank you. - Thank you. And if there's anything you require anything at all, please call on us. Thank you. I'll let you be the first to know. Oh, darling. I've so much to tell you. I know. I have...wait a minute. Come on. Now. - There, comfortable? - Mm, hm-m. Alright, shoot. What have you got to tell me? Well, first...how are you? Well, at the moment lamb chop, I'm the healthiest man alive. Which is remarkable, considering.. Considering what? ...considering that for the past 5 weeks I've been dead. Science was astounded when I came back to life. Well, you haven't proved it to me yet. - No? - Um-m-m. Whoops, huh, sorry. Maybe, I should've knocked. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I should have known you'd come in. Don't be that way. Where'll it get you in the end? I'm the advanced guard for Ms. Hale's fitter hairdresser, masseuse, and what have you? Come on in, girls. - Where do they go, honey? - Oh, the bedroom's due South. Don't get lost in the hall of mirrors. Ha! Okay, sweetheart. Let's go, girls. Oh, here are those 6 tickets you ordered for tonight. Oh, thanks. Hurry. Gotta get 2-3 hours before the opening. Here, the tickets for the opening tonight. Will you give them to Mrs. Olsen and gang? What you mean? You're not coming home? I won't be able to, now. But tonight after the show-- The gang will be disappointed. They planned a swell welcome. By the way, Mr. Bryant said to be sure and use the masseuse. Said a good rub'll setya up for the performance. That was thoughtful of Larry. He's been wonderful to me. Don't you think he's nice? - Must be if you like him. - Been telling about your music. He's awfully anxious to hear it. Oh. Oh, wait a minute. - Here. - Oh, man. Well, go on, go on. Open it. [romantic music] Oh, a cigarette case. Just to remind you, you know. Oh, sure. - Do you like it? - Oh. Go on. Look inside. Okay. What's this? A thousand dollars? Darling, Italy's just around the corner. Yeah. Jimmy, Jimmy. Oh, Mary, do you really still want to go? Mary, I've got it. I've got it. I've got it! Good. Now if you'll just take it somewhere else we'll be happy. No levity now. I've got to work out this idea right away. Er-r. Where's the piano? Oh. Do you mind telling me what's this about? Why, your Madame Butterfly number. Mr. Collier wants an alibi for grand opera in a review. So, with my new lyrics, I'll tell him that the world is shifting, restless, ever-changing, and then...boom! We'll sock him in the puss with Butterfly. [clears throat] [piano music] Now, for the lead up. ♪ Time is a magic thief ♪ ♪ Changes joy to grief ♪ ♪ Makes you laugh and weep ♪ Well, well. The musical ape. For the last time, Bill Foster, don't you get me sore. What do you do? Swing by your tail? Say Mary, time's a wasting, honey. The costumes will never be ready if you don't hurry. I know, but Jimmy and I haven't talked. Come on. You can talk after the opening. But we haven't seen each other for five weeks. Talk to him through the transom, while being fitted. Didn't they teach us Lincoln. Free the slaves? - Oh, not at these prices. - Business comes first. Ah, hm-m, maybe you're right. I'll sit and recite the Ballad of Reading Gaol. You're gonna recite limericks, I suppose I've got to compose. Who? Room service, please. Will you have a drink, buddy? (James) 'No, not until after the opening.' Oh, and what an opening it's gonna be? Hello? Send up a bottle of scotch. Huh? Any age. (Mary) 'Jimmy, are you there?' Ah, the entertainment committee is ready and waiting. Now. I wonder what it's like at the Hofbrau? (James) 'What'd you say Mary?' I said, "What's it like at the Hofbrau?" Oh. Well, I...I meant to tell you about that. I-I'm afraid I have a confession to make. Kitty, bring those pink shoes over, please. - Yes, Ms. Hale. - I didn't quite hear you, dear. Well, it's a personal matter, darling. I-I can't broadcast it. Oh, they broadcast now? Oh, that's wonderful! It must be a big restaurant by now. Yes. It seats 85,000 people. They have waiters on roller skates. Can you get that better under there? Oh, I hope you made them pay you more money for broadcasting. Well, and, you don't understand. There's so.. (Mary) 'What did you say, darling?' I said all Europe sank underwater but they're keeping it quiet on account of the stock market. - Hello Bill. - Hello Bryant. - Know Mr. Gato? - Yes. Of course. Hi. - Where's Mary? - Inside there. - Come along, Mr. Gato. - Oh, put that over there. Pardon me. Guarding the portal? No. I wasn't, as a matter of fact. Should I be? No, I don't think so. [knocking on door] (Mary) 'Who is it?' It's I, me, Larry. Mr. Gato. (Bill) Want a drink, Mr. Bryant? - No, thanks. Bit early for me. - Come right in, Mr. Bryant. Thanks. Come along, Mr. Gato. He doesn't know, but he's paying for this. [humming] - Sure you won't join me? - What's that? - You know, a drink, stimulant. - Yes, I think I will. Good. I hate to drink alone. Say when? When? Sorry to take your line buddy, but you missed your cue. Don't drown it. Oh, neat, huh? Here you are. To good health. Don't look, there's a hard drinker in the house, buddy. And I think it's you. Well, they are beautiful, but-- Just for tonight, dear. Consider them part of your costume. I don't know-- You're the star now, Mary. We want you to dress like one. (Larry) 'I-It's good advertising.' Well, well, is it the usual thing? I mean-- Mademoiselle, this is how I sell most of my merchandise. Mr. Gato is no philanthropist. You ought to get a commission. Well, I suppose if it's the customary thing. - I like the idea, alright. - Um-hm-m. - Let me show Jimmy, huh? - Yeah. Surprise, surprise! Look! Want to see something pretty? That's what's called dressing the part. Quick, my sunglasses. Look! You think Mrs. Olsen will recognize me? - Probably not. - Yes, he's in here, come in. That's Lawrence Bryant. Right over there. - You Lawrence Bryant? - Yes. Well, greetings from the people of New York. Shall I crack him, boss? You say yes, you'll be a long time paying off. I've no desire to see you cracked. I'm just sorry you're in dirty business. Same to you brother. Well, Miss Ingalls, is there anything else? That's all. Just that little paper. Just a ruined career. Plus 20 years of hard work in the gutter. That's all. I'm sure it can't be that serious? (Ingalls) 'You know how hard it is to get a job' 'after been thrown out of a show?' Sure, it can't be as serious as all that. Only thing serious to you, and that's-- Why don't you save that for the newspapers, La Belle? Don't worry about newspapers. I have plenty for them. A fine, first rate, A1 scandal. Have Larry Bryant and Mary Hail on every headline in town. - Now, see here-- - Let me handle this, Seymour. Look here, Miss Ingalls, this is just pure blackmail. - Don't you think? - Call it anything you like. You labeled me a flop so you could make a star out of-- Watch yourself. Oh, Miss Ingalls, you-you're all wrong about this. - Terribly wrong, honestly. - Ha, ha. Wrong, am I? Then suppose you tell us what went on in Atlantic City in Mr. Bryant's apartment every morning until 4'o clock. Listen, why don't you get out? You've talked enough. You couldn't pay me to stay. Well, see you in the newspapers. Oh, how can she say things like that? Can't we do something to stop her? I am afraid not, my dear. Oh, Mary don't be silly. Why, it doesn't mean a thing. She'll be laughed out of the court. The whole thing shouldn't bother you that much. Bothers me, Bryant. You're not going to get melodramatic too? Take your arm away. - Jimmy. - Stay out of this, Mary. - I deserve an explanation. - Jimmy, what do you mean? I can give you an explanation, that woman's crazy with jealousy and frustration, that's all there is to it. If you pay any attention to her, you're descending to her class. Take that jewelry, off. Oh, stop it Jimmy. You don't understand. - Seymour, you're drunk. - What of it? Go home and sleep it off? - Here. - You sleep it off. - Oh, Jimmy. You fool. - Take a good swing. I could explain this whole thing, Jimmy. - What's the matter with you? - I'm gettin' out of here now. - Jimmy, where are you going? - To China. - Jimmy! - Mary. Mary, I've got it, oh!

No, my first husband, Eric, was the same when he was upset. Just like, Jimmy. First he'd get drunk then jealous. And then he'd kick the daylights out of some poor devil. My poor dead Yan was terrible too. When he'd been drinking. Always filling up the bed with talcum powder and making believe we was in a sandstorm. No, no, no. [doorbell rings] That must be, Mary. I'll open the door. Now, please don't say, anything to upset her. - Mary, my liebchen. - Hello, Herman. Is Jimmy here? Well, why weren't you all at the theater tonight? But, Jimmy only got here 10 minutes ago. - Ten minutes? - Yes. - Where is he? - He is upstairs packing. - Packing? - Yes. But Mary, he's not himself. Aren't you going to speak to me, Jimmy? Yeah, just get out of here and leave me alone. Well now, I can explain this silly mess. We won't discuss it. There's no need to act like this. There's every need. I'm going to make a little speech, Jimmy. Will you listen to me? When I was a little girl, I saw a play called "Peter Pan". At the end of the play, Peter pan asked the audience to believe in someone. He said, if they didn't believe he'd die, so. I believed with all my might and he lived. Where's my blue sweater? I've always remembered that. Well, it's that way when you're in love. If you believe in someone. Your love lives. And you've got it always. If you don't believe you've got...nothing. I believe in you Jimmy. Won't you believe in me? No. I believe, what I heard and saw. I heard, Ingalls. And I saw, Bryant. - And seeing's believing. - Oh, no. It isn't. You see what you want to believe. Believing is seeing. Oh, Jimmy, don't you understand that? This is what I understand. You've changed. You're not my wife anymore. You've turned into an electric sign gone up in flames. You've become a public spectacle. Other people own you now. Not me. Collier owns you, the audiences, the autograph hunters the gossip writers, they own you. Larry Bryant owns you. Jimmy, you're drunk. You don't know what you're saying. Sure, I'm drunk. When the drink goes in the truth comes out. How'd you like it? It's funny. There isn't a rotten thing you haven't said to me. But I don't care. I forgive you. Oh! Don't leave me, Jimmy. You wouldn't want me. Not with what I think of you now. Alright, you win. If that's what you want to think you can live with it. - I'm finished. - 'Okay.' Let's drink to that. [tinkling music] (Jimmy) 'Auld Lang Syne. That's a laugh.' Well, here's to it. This is how it ends. It's over. The team, Italy...everything. Italy, that reminds me. Here, go to Italy, go anywhere, take Bryant and your hush money with you, you don't have to buy me off. When you wake up and realize, how wrong you've been. Don't bother to apologize.

[as a lady] Oh, that's quite alright, I'm sure. Well, why don't you look where you're going you big boob. I've...oh, now I've forgotten...oh. Would you let me see that list again, dear? I was trying to remember something forgot little bit. I've never seen such a man. He'd forget his head if he had one. Isn't that nice? She talks as though she were married to me. And that's what I wanted to remember. I meant to ask you to marry me this afternoon under the piano with the presents. Oh, maybe, we'd better do this shopping so he can propose. No, no, no, stop while I've got my mind on it. I'd really make a wonderful husband. There are so many things the matter with me. I forget everything and never do anything right. You can nag me, from morning till night. Now, what more could a wife ask? You're witnesses, both of you. If you back out of this I'll sue you for breach of promise. Do I understand, that you accept me? - You bet, I do. - Ha, ha, ha. I'm probably making the biggest mistake of my life.

We'd better go rescue Cornelius before he mislays himself. Oh, miss, how much is this pretty little one? - Oh, well, never mind. - Take it easy King Kong. - Did you ever see this before? - No, what is it? Oh, yes, of course. Could you match this for me, please? Right here, sir. Ten cents a piece. (Cornelius) 'Oh, ten cents?' - Look, it's Mary Hale. - Yes, sir. - It is. - I am going to speak to her. - You're Mary Hale, ain't ya? - Yes, I am. Oh, Miss Hale, this is a treat. We never see such famous people in this store. Oh, Miss Hale, my aunt Annie, she works here too. She thinks you're the most wonderful person in the world. - May I call her over? - Yes, of course you may. - Alright. Now don't go away. - I won't. Miss Hale, I'll never forget this moment. Girls, girls, girls. What's going on here? - How do you do Miss Hale? - How do you do? This is an honor. And she's as nice as I thought she'd be. Oh, aren't you sweet to say that. Annie'll be so excited, she'll almost die. Oh. Here she comes now. Look, Annie, it's her. Mary Hale. - Miss Hale, this is Annie. - How do you do, Annie? - I heard you on the radio. - Did you like it? - It was grand. - Oh, thank you. Just a minute. I've got something I'd like to give you. - Oh. - A wee bit of heather. - Oh, how sweet of you. - It'll bring you luck. - Thanks. - You must keep it beside you. I will. If there's anything I can do for you I'll be glad to. - Oh, would you now? - Hm. Would you, would you maybe sing a song? Oh, please, Miss Hale. Oh, well, go on, Mary. This is Christmas Eve. I'll tell the song plugger to play something from your show. Alright. "One Look At You". What? Oh, that's the name of the song. Jimmy, will you play "One Look At You" for a very important customer?

[orchestral rendition of "The Blue Danube Waltz"] So, tonight you forget old Herman, huh? That's a bad sign. A musician should never lose his memory. Tonight you got a mood, eh, Jimmy? You're melancholy, right? Well, it's wonderful. That's the best thing in the world for the music. Leave me alone. (Herman) 'Sure, I know how you feel. I leave you alone to compose.' So chilly in here. First, I fix the fire for you, huh? You see, we need a little wood in here. There. That'll build it up. Now, that'll make a nice draft. Now you'll be comfortable. Well, I'll leave you now. Good night, Jimmy. (Jimmy) 'Leave that bottle here.' Oh, Jimmy. Sooner than to see you make such a pig of yourself. - I would sooner see you dead. - Me too. Oh, I didn't mean that. But to drink yourself to stupid day after day. - Why, that's murder. - What's the difference? I'll tell you, what's the difference. The difference is that you have here the most marvelous music that is being written in the world today. That music is great. It's important. It will make you the biggest musician alive! You're a great man, Jimmy. Great man? Does this look like a great man, this garret? Playing an out-of-tune piano in a cheap five and dime store. Is that a great man? I've been living on that piece of hop long enough. But no more. You hear me? I'm cured. - No more pipe dreams. - What are you doing? What I should've done long before this. I'll submit this to the right publisher. - 'Jimmy!' - Wait, I've got another one. - Oh, yes. - Don't, please! This'll set the world on fire, alright. Jimmy! [exclaims in pain] Herman! Wait. Wait there's more. Herman, your hand. You've burned it. - No, no. It's nothing. - I'll get something. Pay no attention to it. - Here, some butter. - Oh. No. - Oh, Herman, I'm so sorry. - That's alright. It's alright. It's nothing. - Don't mind it. - There. Well, does it hurt very much? No. Don't hurt at all, Jimmy. It's alright, pay no attention to it. We make believe it didn't happen. I ought to kick myself around the block. [exhales deeply] [sighs] I've loved her as far back as I can remember. There hasn't been a night when I didn't go to sleep saying her name. I know. (Herman) I know. But you still have your music. Mary Hale was my music. This feeling, will it ever go away, do you suppose? You don't want it to go away. You got something that hurts you. That's important. That means something. Well, write it out. 'Put it in notes, orchestrate it.' 'Make the violins tell it, and the brasses.' 'You never lost Mary Hale. You lost yourself.' You were like a bird that wouldn't fly. A fish that wouldn't swim. A musician that wouldn't write. Speaking a woman's name every night before you go to sleep. 'That's for nobodies, for weaklings.' 'But you...you gotta sing out her name, so she'll hear it.' And no matter where she is she'll hear her name in your music. And then she'll come back to you. [frantic piano music] [frantic piano music continues] [audience applauding] [audience cheering] There's a telegram for you, Miss Mary. Telegram? Oh. See who it's from. [knock on door] Hello, darling. Well, what a night. And Cornelius is sparing no expense for the party. Champagne, guinea hen, strawberries Romanov. I said we ought to save it up for our wedding anniversary. He said, "No. When a show ran two years on Broadway "it was a bigger record than any marriage." - Who's the telegram from? - My divorce lawyer. Everything alright? Oh, yes. Everything's what you might call "perfect". Divorce granted, uncontested. - Uncontested? - Mm-hmm. You haven't heard from him? No. Not a word. (Judy) 'Funny, I'd have thought--' - So would I. I'd have sworn. - I've never seen it to fail. There's always somebody backstage feeling like a tromped-on toad frog 'when they should be turning handsprings.' It's tradition. The merry-go-round of Broadway. On the way up, you have to throw overboard everything you love -- Yes. When you get to the top, you've got nothing left to hold on to but a brass ring, hmm? Oh, well. What will be, will be. (Judy) 'Poor Mary.' Well, never mind. We'll have fun at the party. It ought to be very drunk out tonight. Cornelius will make a terrifically long speech. Don't forget to applaud him. [slow waltz music] - Here's your speech, boss. - Ah, yes, thank you. Well, everything seems to be going beautifully. (Bill) 'Hold it a minute, boys'' Your attention, Ladies and Gentlemen. I'm sorry to interrupt the proceedings. But you've been wined, dined and now you must pay for it. You're about to hear a speech. 'I take great pleasure in introducing to you' 'your bread and butter. The man who controls the jackpot..' None other than that golden throated orator Cornelius Collier, Jr. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, uh, as Voltaire once said "The suffering of life is the joy of art." (Cornelius) 'Well, that maybe all very true.' But, personally, I don't uh, care whether.. Ah! The deuce with it. Ah, folks, I-I'd like to propose a toast to the little lady who for two years, has danced and sung and acted her way further and further up the road of success taking us all with her. I-I feel, we owe her a great big kiss which I, hereby, delegate Larry Bryant, to give her. Ladies and Gentlemen, to Mary Hale. (all) Mary Hale! [all singing] Get set, Mary. Here comes the delegation. I'm pleased to meet you, sir. You can't live with the ghost of the past all your life. I'm gonna ask you just once more. You know I love you. I've waited for all your troubles to end. Well, Mary-- (everyone) 'Speech, Mary! Please.' You better come to the point, Larry. I have to make a speech. Will you marry me? Will you be my wife? [guests applauding] I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you all for being so wonderful. So...so kind to me. [applause] And now, I have a announcement I'd like to make. Er, I'll be going into another production immediately. What? You-- It's to be called "Till death us do apart." But, Mary. That isn't fair. You're under my management now! This will be a very serious type of drama, Mr. Collier. What Mary means to tell is that, she's agreed to marry me. From now on, the theatre will have to do without the services of Mrs. Larry Bryant. That announcement is going to cost me a million dollars. [all laugh] - Congratulations, Mary! - Congratulations. [whistling and piano music] If you're delivering something, leave it on the table. If not, please read the sign. Sign? [piano music continues] What's the.. Herman, why aren't you at work? Has something happened to you? - Not me, you. - Me? For heaven's sake, what's wrong? Take it easy. Compose yourself. Listen, stop fooling me. Something's happened to Mary. I don't know what's the matter with me. When bad happens, I laugh. When good happens, I cry. I guess I got my wires crossed at someplace. - Something good has happened? - Yes. Then, stop crying and tell me. Yes, sit down here. I'll tell you. Now, brace yourself. Jimmy, my boy, you're the new Johan Strauss. Plus Bach, plus Richard Wagner, plus, plus.. I am what? Your new rhapsody. It's sold! Take it easy. I don't want anything to happen to you now. Henry Bartow, is going to produce it here's the contracts, ready for you to sign. And now I have the privilege of being the very first one to say it you "Jimmy Seymour, you're a success." It's not a forgery? Forgery? It's as good as the Declaration Of Independence. Well, is that anything to cry about? You know what this means to me. I've got my nose out of the mud after all that work and waiting. Is that anything to cry about? It's more than human nature can stand. The picture of you being successful with the woman you love, in your arms again. Able to look her in the eye and say, "I love you. And what's more, I'm no longer a washout!" Stop crying, will you? How can I talk to you when you cry like that? I'm not crying. Oh, Herman, I love you! I'm going to buy you a solid gold cello with a bow made of, uh, eagle whiskers! Oh, are you going to be rich! Like, Tchaikowski. And all from little notes of music. Three percent of the gross?

[gasps] The bath salts. Where's me head? I'm that flustered, you'd think it was me going all the way to England to be married. Don't forget a raincoat. They say it never stops raining. Still trying to discourage me? You'll know when you'll do nothing but drink tea for a couple of years. Might as well give up. I'll tell Cornelius, you did your best. Okay, I just hope you don't regret it. If that's a wedding blessing, I wouldn't want more, thank you. Oh, Kitty, uh bury this in the bottom of the trunk, will you? - One of those going to storage. - Yes, Ma'am. You must feel pretty blue, giving up the stage and all the glamour and fun that goes with it. Oh, Judy, I won't miss giving up the stage any more than I'd miss driving a truck down Broadway. It's just that expressions get mixed up at a second wedding. On the third, you'll wear a dead pan. Should've seen my third trip. I looked like the Great Stone Face. Now, stop depressing her, Miss Judy. We, who are about to wed, salute you. Ah, don't pay her any attention, Miss Mary. And put a smile on your face like a bride should. How's that? The perfect smile to be married in. 'It's such a perfect smile, I'd like to wear it myself.' - May I try it on? - Hello. I had a cable from home. They redecorated the chapel for the wedding. They're getting excited about it. How nice. Are you ready to go? No. Not yet. I gotta see the income tax man. Seems I have to buy them a new post office before I leave. With your income, it ought to be a battleship. Now, is that a friendly remark? Get out of here, you prima-donna snatcher. I want to talk her out of it. - Where's your sense of romance? - In my foot. You know where that'll be if you don't get out. Let's have the wedding before we sail. On the way to the boat, jam up traffic? What's a traffic jam? I'll be back in a jiffy. Goodbye, you. Oh, hi-ho. Well, Mr. Bryant, how are you? I'm glad to see you. Nice weather, isn't it? Fine. Yes, thanks. It is. I love October. It's a wonderful month. [both singing] ♪ All my days, I'll sing the praise of brown October ale ♪ - You know Herman, Larry Bryant. - How do you do? Well, nice to have seen you again, Mr. Bryant. - Say, I hit you, didn't I? - Oh.. Oh, that was a terrible thing to do. Well, youth, youth. Have to forgive me. Oh, sure. I've forgotten it. If it'll make you feel better, hit me back, will you? Oh, no. I wouldn't dream of it! Okay, then. Friends again, huh? Thanks a lot. - Come on, Herman. - Goodbye. Going down, sir? Yes. Yes, I guess it'll be alright. [doorbell buzzes] That must be Cornelius, with some arguments. You'd better see him get it over with. - I'll finish tagging things. - Alright. Alright. Jimmy. Hello, Mary. Hello, Herman. Mary, he's done it. He's a success. He's not what he looks like. He's a success. It was a downhill climb, but now he's at the bottom. I mean uphill, he's at the top. In the clear. Well, you two have your conversation. I go home and wait for both of you. Goodbye. I guess I must've been crazy to come rushing in like this 'but that's all I've been planning for a year.' I've been sitting, writing. You know, I got started on some music. I didn't want to see you until I'd finished it. To hold my head up and tell you I wasn't a flop. That I wasn't somebody holding onto your petticoats or riding along on your prestige. Well, now they're going to produce my work. 'Sounds pretty silly, but' it's been terribly important for a long time. That's why I couldn't see you or ask you to forgive me or tell you anything. But, Jimmy. How was I to know that you it's been two whole years. Well, you've been on my mind so much, I.. It seems like yesterday that we had-- Two whole years! But I've made good now, Mary. That's all over. That that inferiority complex that made me jealous and stupid. I have that buried now. Buried under a million notes. All of them going to be sung. Won't you forgive me, Mary? Oh, Jimmy. Why did you have to come back now when I'd almost forgotten you? Do I have to go through it all again? That whole heart-aching business of forgetting you again? Well, I won't. I've waited for you long enough, Jimmy. I gave you every chance. I-I have a different life to lead, now. - Mary-- - Go away, Jimmy. Forget me like I forgot you. But go away. Oh, Mary, stop fooling yourself! You know you never could lie to me. I remember you. You always bite your lip, when you're lying. You know that there's only one life for you and me and that's together. No, no, Jimmy. You're too late. Much, much too late! Too late? But, why? Why? Because, at exactly 4 o' clock. I'm leaving for England, to be married. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I guess, that's what I get for not reading the society columns. [melancholy orchestral music] [door-bell buzzes] - Is, Miss Hale in? - Yes, sir. Oh, Mary. Thank heaven, I'm in time. You have to cancel your trip, Mary. You can't go. I've just bought an astounding piece of music for you. Got it from Henry Bartow. Gave twice what he paid for it. He...what's the matter? Here, stop that. I don't pay you to break my cigars. Sorry, Chief, but there's your composer. Who? Oh! Oh, hello. You're James Seymour, aren't you? - I'm afraid, so. - Well, this is a coincidence. I'm going to produce your music. It's marvelous. Glad you like it. It's tailor-made for Mary. Wait till you hear it, Mary. Please, not now, Cornelius. But now or never. Come on, Gene. Get busy. - Yes, Sir. - Yeah, let's go. - We try it from the beginning? - Yeah. What say, boss? No, no. Just the theme. Wait, you've gotta help me persuade her to stay. I need your support. - Hmm, that's a laugh. - What? Oh, nothing. Goodbye, Mary. Lots of happiness. Goodbye, Jimmy. [piano music] Uh, but just a minute. We've got to discuss. - You're not going? - Yes. But I never thought I was writing my own exit music. But, you..Oh, but.. What is it? It's beautiful. Beautiful? It's magnificent. And the idea behind it is marvelous. What a climax! The birth of a melody. Starting with a shepherd on a hill, and evoluting right down through the centuries. I'm gonna treat the whole thing impressionistically with symbols and movement. It's never been done before. Oh, Mary, at the climax you come on. The spirit of pure melody, lovely and radiant. Please. I don't care how marvelous it is. I'm not going to listen to it. Ah, well. Uh, Gene! Wait, uh just play that climax for her. Yes. Listen, I don't want to hear it, I'm through. Definitely through. [piano music] Alright. Then we won't produce the show. What? I don't know any other girl that can sing it. - Oh, but you told Jimmy-- - Yes, I know I told him. And I-I'll produce it sometime. But for now, I'm gonna put it on the shelf and look around. Put it on the shelf? You go ahead and catch your ship, honey. - This isn't your worry. - Sure, what's the difference. 'One show more or less.' - I can't do this to Jimmy. - I understand how that is. 'But, you see without you, my hands are tied.' Alright, I'll stay. I'll postpone the wedding. Only, how am I going to explain it to Larry? Well, don't worry. I'll tell him or Bill will. Better yet, we'll let Judy tell him. - What? - That's the best idea. - Larry wouldn't hit a woman. - That's what I was counting on. [broadway music playing] For the last act, take your places, please. Two minutes. Two minutes. Take your places for the last act. Drop that short line, just a trifle. Places. Places. Last act. Take 'em out. Hurry up, take 'em out. Last act! Hurry up. And be careful with those masks. - It's going great, Fred. - Fine, yeah. Hurry. It's nearly time to ring up. It's alright. It's alright. Mary, I can't locate him. I phoned his home, hotels, bars, everywhere. Jimmy. I wanted you to be here tonight more than I've wanted anything. Don't worry, Miss Mary. Mr. Herman's out looking for him. - He'll find him. - Well, it's beyond me. I could understand his not being here for rehearsals. But how can a man stay away on his own opening night? Hello, hello, hello, me Irish biddy. - And how are you today? - Fine, Sir. - Have a potato chip? - No, thank you, Sir. Interesting American habit, potato chips. Gastronomic-solitaire. Well! Hello Judy. Potato chip? No, thanks, I'll have my bag instead. Oh, you'll have.. Hey, what's this? Tears? Idle tears in the midst of a triumph. Why do you cry? I'm not crying...see? [chuckles] You know, you've been wearing that for quite a while. I don't know what you mean. I mean I've listened to two acts and you've been a great disappointment to me. - What? - Yeah. - I never heard you sing better. - Larry, you've been drinking. Drinking? I'm soused. Soused and selfish. I wanted this show to flop. The longer it runs, the longer I wait. I even hoped that you'd sing badly on purpose, of course. - What are you driving at? - Well, I figured that tonight you'd either sing badly for my sake or sing well for his. I only know one way to sing. Of course you do. And you only know one way to love. And that's with your whole heart. - And that's why.. - Why, what? That's why I wanted you. That's why I couldn't get you. [knock on door] (boy #1) 'Miss Hale! Miss Hale! They're holding the curtain.' Mary. Mary, they're waiting for you. Yes, they're waiting for you. Yes. I knew you'd go through with it. You're a real thoroughbred. Thank you. (Herman) 'Mary, I found him. Here he is!' He was up in the balcony. I mean, the peanut gallery. - Oh, hello, Bryant. - Hello, come on, we must go. Oh, just a minute. I have some unfinished business with you, Seymour. Can it wait? I'd like to hear the last act. Oh, observe. A reservation for the best bridal suite on the Laconia but I'm using it tonight. A bridal suite for one. Where are you going? To eat worms in London. You're leaving Mary? All in good time. Do you remember making me an offer? - No. - Well, I do. I come from a long line of elephants I'm going to take advantage of the gracious offer right now. Now we're even. Sorry, I can't stay for the show or I might miss the boat. Oh, well. Gee, thanks. Thanks a lot. Oh, by the way, Seymour. If you ever meet the chap who said "It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all," tell him I'd like to rub it in his hair, will you? Goodbye.
