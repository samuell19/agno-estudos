Honey, the snows is pretty blue flowers. They is early bloomers... Like you, Maggie. Aw! I missed you, keefi. Ahem. You too, Clarice. You just missed my fried catfish and my hushpuppies.

You asked for it is about to begin. I can't. I got plans. Tell me something I don't already know. Delia, do you ever get the feeling you're really ready for something, but you don't know what it is? I am so ready. Good heavens, darling. Ready for what? I don't know. Something. Anything. Well, I think some evil character, some black knight upon his black steed, has cast a warm, cozy, magical spell on you. Now. Now. Hey, Maggie! Well, if it isn't our notorious gdi. Hey, aiken. For a minute I thought, "is Maggie praying?" Maybe I was, sort of. Is that Delia? Hey! I didn't know you were still friends. Don't be such a stranger! Close your eyes again, Maggie. Maybe you'll see a sign. Hell, maybe your prayers will come true. I wasn't praying, really. I was only kidding. Life's too short not to try everything once. Close your eyes. Trust me. You'll see a sign. I knew it! A sign! Whoo! You're crazy, aiken Reed! Nope. Not yet. Still looking forward to that. Bye. You know, I'd watch out for that one if I were you. Never trust a goddamn independent. That's right. Tell you what... Tuck invited me to go to Phoenix city with him tonight. Come go. No one need be the wiser. I don't know. I got an 8:00 class in the morning. Well, so? Come on, Maggie. It's our last night to howl. And tonight, I feel hot. Besides, tuck says at ma beechie's there's this woman who can pick up a Dixie cup with her you-know-what. All right! Let's have a big round of applause for miss cherry delight and all the girls.

[Honk] Y'all go to Randolph? Yes. This is Delia June curry, and i'm Margaret deloach. I don't believe we've officially met, but i'm Charles Payton Tucker--tuck. Pleased to meet you, tuck. Hoyt Cunningham. You are nothing but a hero. I thought they were going to kill me. I never thought that boy-- yes, you did. That boy just asked me to dance. I watched you all night. You're lucky tuck isn't dead. I would like to thank you for your kind assistance. Think nothing of it, tuck. What in god's name were you doing in that place? I don't think that's any of your business. You haven't got any spirit for adventure. You've got a real spirit for adventure, don't you, hoyt? You're not from around here. Matter of fact, I am. Greenville, Mississippi. Greenville? That's where Maggie's boyfriend comes from. My boyfriend's name is boots claibourne. I coached that little shit in pop Warner football. How is he? He's perfectly charming. He's Maggie's fiance. Yeah. She's pinned to old boots. Gonna marry that pretty boy, aren't you, mags? You going to marry boots? That's for US to know and you to find out. You hungry? No, not really. I'm getting some coffee. You coming? I am definitely not eating here. See you later. Well, all right, but I am not eating. Oh! So what were you doing at ma's? Working. Let me guess. Woman's lingerie salesman working ma's strip joint, right? Close. I'm a photographer for the ap. I'm covering racial trouble at fort benning. Maggie wrote on the negro situation for the school paper about that girl who tried to register for classes at 'bama. Autherine Lucy. Wasn't much of a piece. There's talk of integration at Randolph. What do you make of that? There will be no negroes at Randolph in our time. Well, that's good to know. We don't have to worry about that Montgomery boycott. Are you talking about that preacher--what's his name? Martin Luther King. They don't do anything but sing and not ride the buses. Is that what you really think? That's what my daddy thinks. He says they'll get tired and go home. Your daddy's in for a big surprise. It's going to get very ugly out there. Before it's over, a lot of people will get killed. You sound like you like the idea. It doesn't matter whether I do or don't. Just is. Are you a communist? Ha ha ha ha! Sweet god. Come on! Let's go! Let's get tuck a coffee. Come on, Dee. Coming! I'd like coffee to go, please.

I'll drive you home. And if you're a good boy, I'll help get your car back in the morning. Never turn down an offer like that from a beautiful woman, right, hoyt? Never. Say good night, tuck. Good night. Tell boots if I get a chance I'll stop by and see him. Thank you for your help. Does he still take his ball home when he doesn't get his way? Look, it was nice of you to get US out of that bar-- we owe you for that-- but I don't have to listen to you knock my fiance and my mind for the way I think about things. US simpletons must have bored you to death tonight. Hey, Maggie... Did you know when you get all hot and bothered, your chest just turns bright red? "...and bending down beside the glowing bars, "murmur, a little sadly, how love fled, "paced upon the mountains overhead and hid his face amid a crowd of stars." Miss Reed... Since you insist upon polluting the rarified atmosphere of my classroom with that noxious weed, I insist that you hand me that pack so I may do the same. [Laughter] As miss Reed is no doubt aware, all is not passion and sea mist and leering god with the Irish. William Butler yeats-- a Mick jerk. [Laughter] Mr. Foley... Yes, sir? Is there something about Mr. Yeats' poem that you appreciated and would like to share with the rest of the class? No, sir, Mr. Flournoy, nothing in particular. No. No, sir. Hmm. Mr. Claibourne? Boots? How about you? There's a lot of charm in the sentimental description. It's romantic melodrama, really. If you cut through that, you get to something else, something deeper, less romantic. Truth is, no one wants to be alone without love, whether you're old or young.

If jenks knew, nothing. The guy is a cheerleader. What does that tell you about his mind? Jenks and Delia, they're everybody's ideal-- Randolph's Romeo and Juliet. If that's true, then Romeo probably has the IQ of an argyle sock. And Juliet could pull a train longer than the population of fort benning and come back begging for more. Oh! I know. The pot calling the kettle black, right? Difference is, I'm honest. I don't tease. Anyway, I've often thought that tuck was interesting. I wonder if a real woman would scare the pants off him. Hi, Maggie! Hey. Want a gum ball? What if we go to New York, right after graduation-- greenwich village. My sister says it's the most exciting place. Think about it. I got to go. Where does tuck usually hang out? The senator newspaper office, but, aiken... Nothing wrong with a little competition, is there? You be careful. Careful? Of what? Ha ha!

I'd give my heart and soul to get married and live in a place like that. You just act like it's nothing. In the first place, I haven't seen his Tara, so I don't know what it looks like. Second, I haven't mentioned marriage. Third, if we got married, we wouldn't live with his mama and the infamous judge. Honey, they're going to die. I mean, sooner or later. Then you will be the mistress of groveland. All those servants. Boots' beautiful children. Sure seems like a fairy tale come true to me. Is that really what you think, Dee? Yes, ma'am. I mean, it's just right out there, and if you closed your eyes and just reached out, you could get it, just like that gold ring on the merry-go-round. I mean, can you really imagine wanting anything else? Now you think about that, Maggie. You're an Alpha chi delta, boots says. Oh, that's nice. So many of our delta girls affiliate with that sorority. You're housed in such a lovely old mansion. But nothing to compare with groveland. You and the judge have the most beautiful home. This is nothing but a big old pink elephant. Come on, coralee. Groveland is the best plantation in the delta, a regular shangri-la, right, judge? Shangri-la, huh? Don't you wish. Whatever's going to happen to this shangri-la after I'm gone, Maggie, is anybody's guess. Courtney, what are you talking about? This is boots' place. With the proper help, he'll rule the roost. Isn't that right, judge? Hell, yeah. I guess so, honey. Maggie, think you can keep this slug from pissing it away after I'm gone? Ha ha ha ha! Hey, judge. Guess who's back? Who? Hoyt Cunningham. Can you believe it? He ran into Maggie the other night. How is old hoyt? What's he up to, Maggie? I'm not sure. I ran into him in the-- place where he was working. He's a photographer for one of the wire services. Boots told me all about him. As I recall, you did most of the telling. What exactly did hoyt say? I guess we did talk for a time. I found him fascinating, really. Did you know that he believes the negroes are planning to enroll at Randolph, trying to integrate? I wouldn't worry my pretty little head about that, darling. He's still talking about the next great revolution? Another civil war fought on the delta? Is he still talking crap? Courtney claibourne... Revolution, my busted butt. Courtney, I won't have you talk like that. Don't talk like that in front of Cleveland. I don't give a damn. Hey, Cleveland? Yes, sir. You hear talk about riots among the hands? No, sir. You thinking about revolting? Oh, no, sir. That boy better not come here spreading those lies. 'Cause ain't nobody treats his niggers better than I do. Right, Cleveland? Yes, sir. You turned on me and made me look like a fool. Oh, Maggie-- all that stuff about hoyt Cunningham. You led me right into that. Did the trick, too. Got the old man off my young ass. I didn't say that to help you. Why'd you say it then? You're no nigger lover, are you? You don't have any idea who I am really. What am I going to do with you? You're back early. Thought y'all were going to Birmingham for dinner and a show. Dinner and a show, my foot. What happened? We never even went anywhere near Birmingham. Instead, we went to this cruddy hole, an apartment one of his fraternity brothers has. Said there was going to be this party there. Nobody showed up but me and Mr. Fastest-hands- in-Alabama. He said he had something important to ask me and he wanted to be alone. What did he want to ask? Jesus, Maggie! He asked me to go all the way. What did you say? What did I say, Maggie? I'm honors, 4.0 every goddamn semester. I said... Just who in the goddamn bluebelly hell did he think he was? And what kind of girl did he think I was? And just take me home. And? He jumped me. What did you do? I drilled him hard right in the teeth and yelled "rape." Do you know what he said then? He said, "it ain't rape when it's willing." You don't know, Maggie. See, you already have your pin. These guys out there, they're just-- well, he simply forced bourbon down my throat. I'm sure I smell like my da-da on Friday night. On a Friday night. I'll talk to Dean Howard. We'll have that boy out on probation. No. I can't do that. Why on earth not? Sister... [Sniffling] You didn't. You haven't.

This has been a terrible tragedy for all of US, but we can't let our standards slip. The chi delts have always had a sense of deep southern pride and iron integrity with which we face adversity. And Delia June curry needs US now more than ever. With this thought in mind, it is with much sorrow and regret that I propose placing a one-year moratorium on the chi delt involvement of the honeysuckle queen pageant this year. [All talking at once] Girls... I honestly believe that Delia June would want it that way. I second that. All those in favor... Ok, girls. I need a hand count. Would you all cooperate and raise your hands? Wait a minute! We have a legacy to uphold. Honeysuckle queen is a chi delt tradition. I know that, sue Ellen! If the thetas win, m.A., we'll never live it down. Next year during rush, we'll pay for this. Delia is a beautiful girl, but she's not the only beauty in this sorority. The nominee has to be a senior. Listen, I'm not saying I'm Ava gardner, but, y'all-- sit down, corney. Hey, what about Maggie? She's a senior. No... I don't want to. Yes! She was centennial queen in lytton over easter, right? I don't want to. Maggie, you're perfect. You've got charm, poise, even beauty. Thank you. You have more honors than anybody else. And boots claibourne's pin won't exactly hurt. Oh, it's perfect! Excuse me... Did I miss something? I mean, forgive me, but we are talking about honeysuckle queen, am I right? I believe I was elected unanimously to be the chi delt nominee for honeysuckle queen. I see no reason to change that. Ooh!

I tried to call you, but they said you weren't there. Well, excuse the mess. Mama said there would be days like this. How about years like this? Would you like to sit down? Hoyt. Last night when everything was happening, you were just standing there taking pictures. You didn't do anything to try and help. Why? Well, that's my job. That's what I do. I understand that's what you do. Don't you care? Come on, I want to show you something. It's him. Hoyt... I better go. Maggie? I want you to have these. [Talking and laughing] Oh, Maggie. Maggie! Maggie, she did it. Sister did it! Ah! I thought we'd never get her pinned. Maggie! Maggie, I did it. I finally did it. I got pinned. Oh! Yeah! Oh, sister. Oh, Maggie, I finally did it.

I needed some quiet. You ok? Let's just say that I had a long night. I'm fine. There you are. Morning, tuck. I came for you this morning, but you weren't there. I was here. Oh, right. Of course. Aren't you going to read it? Maggie, not only do I have my own editorial to write, I've got about 10 pounds of galleys to proof. I'm sure yours is good. I wouldn't dare rewrite you. I know better. I think you better read it, tuck. Y'all want some nestle's and a glazed doughnut? No, thanks. Suit yourself. I can't run it. Why not? You know why not. The board of directors will lose their minds. This isn't the newspaper speaking out. It's me. Maggie, I got my young ass in a ringer over that simple piece that you wrote about autherine Lucy! This will drive every Dean, regent, plus the president straight up the goddamn wall! Are you going to run it or not? Well, we're going to get booted out of here, right off the senator staff, maybe the school. Y'all sure you don't want anything? Jean! What? Maggie, you've thought about the consequences, I take it? The chi delts, your parents, boots, your degree. I want to run this column. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll take this before the board of publications on Monday night. That's the best I can do. Dean Howard's on the board, right? Yes, he is. Will you stand up for me, tuck? Honest? I don't know. I just don't know. Maggie. This here is really good. I wish I'd written it. Thanks. Hey, sister said you've been trying to reach me all morning. Are you ok? Comme ci, comme ca. Well, what's going on? I'm pregnant. I thought you said you were using something. I was. Well, what happened? Maggie, diaphragms don't always work. Sometimes they just don't work. Sad but true. You pays your money, and you takes your chances. What are you going to do? That's why I wanted to see you. I'm leaving Randolph. I wanted to say good-bye. I'm going to miss you very much, Maggie. No. You can't leave. You don't have to leave. Listen. I'm going to New York. My sister's got this cute apartment and a terrific job with an interior design firm in the city. She thinks she can get me a job with her. But without a husband, without a father for the baby? I never wanted to be married, Maggie. Maybe what I'm looking for really is a man, but not any I met up till now. And I don't think it's a man anyway, more like something I'll do myself. Something sort of great! You know me, Maggie. I've always wanted to think I'll be a great woman someday. I'll write you when I get settled. Ok? Can you believe it, Maggie? I'm going to be living in greenwich village. Come on. Help me get packed. "X" marks the spot. Life starts here. Now. Good afternoon. Come in. Come in. Won't you please be seated? Now, on Monday evening past the publication board met, but you already knew that. I knew they met, yes, Dean Howard. I might add that your editor-in-chief placed your opus before the board with considerable passion. He said yours was a sane and eloquent voice on campus that deserved to be heard, and rightly so. Fine sentiments, miss deloach. Of course there have been, shall we say, racial inequities. I applaud your sensitivity. Thank you. But here at Randolph we depend on the generous wisdom of our board of regents and on the gracious pocketbooks of our dedicated alumni. Shall we get to the point, Dean Howard? The point is... That because of the volatile political atmosphere in Alabama today, we cannot allow you to publish this column. Would you mind elaborating just a little, sir? I'm not quite sure what you're getting at. We're dealing with a very sensitive issue here, things that go beyond your awareness and understanding. You'll just have to trust US as educators to know what's right. But can you be more specific, Dean Howard? I could be, but I choose not to be. And if we choose not to trust you and publish it anyway? Now you listen to me, young lady. I don't want to burst your little bubble. I don't even want to be the one to call your daddy and tell him I'm sending you home. But you know what? I won't just make you resign, I'll expel your behind so fast, your head will swim! You, too, son! Well... I'm sure that in time, miss deloach, you'll not only see what's at stake for you personally, but you'll see the wisdom of our position as well. Am I clear? I regret this unpleasantness had to happen. And I apologize for my choice of language and for being so brief. The junior chamber of commerce is expecting me for lunch. If you'll excuse me, then. You can take Rhett Butler. I'm going to marry Ashley wilkes as soon as Olivia de havilland dies. Frankly, m.A., I don't give a damn. I don't know nothing about birthing no babies! I don't know what to do with my hair. I see curls, lots of curls. Good god, where have you been? Working. The newspaper. Are you crazy? The ball starts in 2 hours, and you're still working? Dee, I'm not going. Did you and boots have a fight again? It's not about that. Don't be ridiculous. Of course you're going. Maggie, this is the biggest, most important night of my life. You've got to go. I want you to read something. Later. I'll read it later. Now, Dee, please. Well, all right. Go on! Get in the tub! Read it, ok? I'm reading. I'm reading. Come on, girls! Let's get beautiful. Keefi, save me. I know. Curls. Lots and lots of curls. Hi. Hi. Hi. There are traditions, and there are traditions, but the coronation of the honeysuckle queen here at Randolph is a tradition of renewal. Rebirth, you might say, of a history and heritage we Cherish. Like the song says, "old times here are not forgotten. "Look away, "look away, look away, dixieland." All the fraternities have voted. Your honeysuckle queen-- your honeysuckle queen for 1957 is miss Delia June curry! Yay, Delia! Thank you, especially to my sisters at Alpha chi delta. When I was hurting, you were there for me. You know, when you mix 100 years of tradition, gentility, and good old southern honor...

This isn't some kind of joke, is it? What am I supposed to tell these people? They're our friends. I knew you would be hurt by this. Don't you see? I had no choice. I needed-- you needed, Maggie?

Officials say that this is a violation of state law and are prepared to defend Alabama's constitution. The prospective student will be accompanied by federal marshals to help enforce this nation's new civil rights laws. Well, god bless the south and long live Alabama. This has been Charles Payton Tucker, the voice of Randolph university. Bye. Bye. I got something for you. It's a glory-o-the-snow. Keefi... You're my light. Any moment now, Randolph university...

Nigger! You get out of here! You trash! Young lady, I have been ordered by the government of the United States to allow you entry to this institution of higher learning. I do so reluctantly, under duress. However... May I submit to you that when I was inaugurated governor, I took an oath to uphold and perpetuate the laws of this great state, and I also intend to fulfill that oath to keep this state free and sovereign. Yeah! Governor! Who's running this state anyway? Please, please. People, go home! Please! Go home! Let's go! You can't do this! It's not right! It's not! You want to go say good-bye? Yeah. Ok. I'll wait here. Maggie. I heard you were leaving. I refused to apologize to Dean Howard, so I have no choice. I'm sorry to hear that. Say good-bye to boots for me. I will. Take good care of him. I promise. Take care of yourself, Dee. I'll never forget you, Maggie. I swear I never will. Bye. Well... Well, I'll be seeing you. Hoyt. You pull out all the stops, Maggie.
