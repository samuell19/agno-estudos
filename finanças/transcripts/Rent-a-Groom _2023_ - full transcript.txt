Isn't it magical? Sure, Grama. Though I can't tell if the bride's wearing little glass slippers or not. I bet they were high school sweethearts. He proposed to her on a vacation in Paris. The engagement ring rolled up in a pair of his socks. She's gonna jump off that cake, and ride off on a pumpkin any minute. Oh. Hmm. I've always loved this place. They do such wonderful little weddings here. I remember when your dad married your mom. He was so nervous. I had to tie his bow tie for him. I guess that's one good thing about having a bum ticker at my age. I'll be seeing them both soon. Grams, please don't talk like that. Allan does take good care of me. He's probably back home, mixing up my dinner hour medicinal cocktail right now. That should buy me a few more hours. Save the dramatics for your readers. I'd always imagined I'd keel over at my typewriter. You still have a typewriter? Still, it isn't how you die. - It's how you live. - Hmm. I'm proud of my writing. I'm glad I was able to bring some happiness to some people. Even if were a little corny. Hey. You are still Barmont publishing's number one author. And I'm most thankful for that. But I'm most proud of my granddaughter. Honey. I know it hasn't always been easy living with a substitute mom who spent more time with imaginary heiresses and farm hands, and less time at school plays and birthday parties. With Mom and Dad gone, you had to be a mom twice. Still. There is one thing I'd like to see before I go. Okay, Grams. Come on. We are not having the marriage discussion again, are we? It isn't about marriage. It's about your happiness. Whether you're married or not, I just wanna leave knowing that you're with someone. I don't want to have this conversation. Not now. You can't plot out my life like one of your stories, Grama. Grams. Grama! Are you okay? - Pills. - Pills! Here, here! I just want you to be happy. Grams, I'm happy! Take your pill. With someone. I... I... I am. I have. Please. Your pill. I'm engaged. - Really? - I was gonna surprise you today. I'm engaged. Does he make you happy? Yes, so happy. Mrs. Westmoreland. Is everything all right? I think so. Grams? I think I'll just get her home. I'm so sorry. I should have been there. No, no, no, no, Allan. It was a girls' day out. - Mm. - Mm-hmm. - All right, come on. - Margaret Westmoreland. What are we going to do with you? - You okay? - Mm-hmm. You are grounded, young lady. I'm all right. Really. I'm all right. - No, Allan. - It's okay. I got her. I'll go steep the tea. Let's get you inside. Mm. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I upset you. Oh, Grams, no. I'm... I'm sorry. I upset you, and you can't afford to get upset. I'm all right now. Okay. I have to go. Wait. You're engaged? Yeah, Grams. I'm engaged. I'm happy for you. Me too. I'll talk to you soon. I want to meet him. I got it. See you, sweetie. Hey, Tray. Shall we get right to the morning madness? First book is a new one from Gardner. Sci-fi, historical fiction, satire hybrid? - Good morning, Tracey. - Yes. Carl wants you to fix its identity crisis. Tracey? Tracey. Carl wanted me to give this to you. Okay. Thank you, Connie. Next, is the Cartwell Saga. Carl wants you to turn this epic into a novella. Take it to the chop shop, and get the blow torch out. Hey. I'm just the one who brings you the jalopies. You're the one who makes them run. How's your grandmother? Yeah. They're still not really sure. The doctors say she's getting worse. Could be weeks, could be days. Oh, Tracey, I'm so sorry. Yeah. Though she did perk up a little bit after pressing me on my love life. Oh? No, nothing to tell. Just... A little white lie? - Yeah. - Nothing wrong with that. Sometimes, telling people what they wanna hear can be the best medicine. Yeah. Maybe. And tell her we all miss her. This place has been pretty gloomy these last few months. Okay. Bring it in. Mm, thank you. My pleasure, my treasure. Yeah. Oh, I need a coffee. Okay. Tracey Westmoreland. Tracey? It's Allan. Allan? Oh, my God. What's... what's happened? Your grandmother made tea. What? What do you mean? The other day when you came to visit, what did you talk about? Oh, Allan, I'm sorry. We got on the marriage discussion again. I think I may have upset her. You may have just cured her. Like I said, she walked to the kitchen this morning. Completely unassisted? And made tea for two! Wedge of lemon, the good China. Oh, glorious! And the doctors were here. They say she's responding to her medication much better. You... you're kidding. That's... that's great! - Great? - It's a full-on miracle! We are talkin' Holy Ghost power over here. Then she told me of another little miracle. She said she's going to meet a man in your life? You know, I'm not one to be morbid, but I think it's wonderful that you want your grandmother's last days to be filled with joy by having found joy yourself. Oh, you're an absolute angel! - You know, if I weren't married, - I'd snap you up myself. Mm. But I guess Hector would have something to say about that. Thanks, Allan. I gotta go. Can you give my love to Grams? I will. See you, sweetie! See ya. You must be Tracey. Mm. Rob Humphries. You look exactly like your picture. It's great to meet you. - Please. - May I? Okay. So, uh, tell me about the service. Right. Well, Rent-a-Groom deploys folks like me for all kinds of circumstances. Jealous friends, creepy bosses, amorous coworkers. We can play boyfriends, long-lost loves, right up to full-on fiancés. Once, I actually played an overbearing older brother. Uh, Humphries. That's your... that's your last name? Actually, it's a stage name. I'm a... I'm an actor. And a fan of Casablanca. I took the name from Bogey. - Humphrey. - Bogart. I get it. Well, I hope you're a fan of Raiders of the Lost Ark, because I'm changing your name to Jones. Okay. Uh, great. Well, usually, the agency supplies the back story, but I can see you have a very thick folder there. Mister Humphries. Not Jones. Rob. I have created a complete character profile including a modest job at a junior accounting firm and a cabin in the mountains. May I? Wow. There are tabs if you... Rob Jones it is. I can live with that the few days we'll be working together. Although, I don't expect you to memorize everything. I'll be there, of course, to keep you on track. I just... I need attention to detail. Okay. I mean, I love this stuff. Sounds like fun actually. Mr. Humphries... Uh, Mr. Jones. I wanna be clear with you. I need this to go by the numbers, and in an expeditious manner. Right. Of course. Okay. Do you know who Margaret Westmoreland is? The romance writer. The Cassandra Robards series. My mom used to read those when I was a kid. She loved them. Hmm. Ah. Wait. Westmoreland. Are you related to her? She is my grandmother, yes. You kidding me? - No. - Wow. Wow. Your grandmother. Yes. She is, um... she's very ill. Oh, gosh. I'm... so sorry to hear that. My parents died when I was very young. And Maggie raised me by herself. Sounds like a... Like an incredible lady. Well, ever since I was a little girl, she one day dreamed of walking me down the aisle to marry Mr. Right. This is Mr. Right. - Oh. - With her illness, she won't be there for the wedding day. This is about a couple of weeks of joy. She needs to believe completely in this engagement. Absolutely. I assure you, I will not let you down. So, when do we start? Tomorrow... at my grandmother's house. Yep? How is Barmont Publishing's greatest fixer this morning? You know, got my head under the hood of another one. Ah, well, that's the problem when you're the best at something. You get stuck there. - Believe me, I know. - Mm. Sounds like you could use a break. Let me take you to lunch. I'm afraid it's leftovers at the desk for me again today. Mm. Dinner it is then. In fact, I think it's about time we popped the cord on that Dom. I got a good feeling about this sci-fi series. I can't. Hey. Listen. It was one date. - It was a mistake. - I had a great time. It's not what I mean, Todd. - We work together. - I agree. We work very well together in fact. Exactly. And I would like to keep it that way. One drink. Call it a do-over. I'm going to my grandmother's house tonight. Right. Of course. How is Maggie doing? Better surprisingly. Mm. Mm-hmm. That is good to hear. Good to hear. Amazing to think that this whole company started with her first Cassandra novel 30 years ago. Thirty-one actually. Yep. Everything's gonna change around here once I get the editor-in-chief position. Hey, but don't worry. Nothing's gonna change between you and I. I need Barmont's best fixer on my team. Mm. Okay. All right. Well... back to makin' millions. Just kidding. I do pretty well, though. And, uh... give your grandmother my best, okay? You got it. Can you close my door, Todd, please? Todd... Janice! How the heck are ya? Okay. Thank you. Are you ready? - Ready. - Okay. Right. Engaged. Sweetie! Hi, Allan. Good evening. I'm... An absolute dream boat. Get in here. Welcome. Thank you, Allan. Thank you. Make yourselves comfortable. I'll just be in the kitchen eavesdropping. Cassandra Robards. Appointment with Destiny. Grams. It was my mom's favorite in the series. Mine, too! I had all the framed covers at the old house. But it seemed a little vain to put up 20 books. I figured one would do. It's a good one. Oh! It's so nice to finally meet you, Rob. It's an honor to meet you, Mrs... Maggie. Call me Maggie. Maggie. Hi. Grams, I mean... you look great! I feel pretty great, too, kiddo. This way. Tea, anyone? Thank you, Allen. Of course. Don't forget your little pair of teeth, my sweet. Mm-hmm. Cheers. I'll be upstairs, watching my little murder shows for a while. You kids have fun. I hope you like Earl Grey. Mm-mm! My favorite. Help yourself to the strudel. I baked it fresh this afternoon. You baked strudel? Of course. That's funny. I don't remember so much as a single cupcake on any one of my birthdays. Thank you. I pulled it out of the archives. I found this wonderful, old Austrian recipe for pear strudel when I was doing research for book four. One Vienna Summer. Yes. You read it. Well, over my mom's shoulder. Impeccable taste, both of you. So, your folks, they'll be coming to the wedding? My mom has passed. And my dad, well, he's not really in the picture. I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I understand what that kind of loss means. Thank you. I know she would have loved Tracey. And she would've been thrilled to be in-laws with the great Margaret Westmoreland. Charming fellow. Wherever did you find him? Well, Rob's accounting firm does some consulting for the publishing company. Hmm. One day, we just kind of fell into each other's arms. Fell? More like crashed. The ski hill didn't look quite so steep from the bottom. - Ski hill? - Hmm. When did you take up skiing? I... Whitefish. March. A beautiful time of year. You know, I think it was the early morning glare off the white mountain caps. First run of the day. Pristine powder. Nothing but the sound of the wind through the trees. Just... Oh, my goodness. I was racing down the mountain. The Arctic chill at my back. And nothing but virgin snow before me. As I rounded a bend, a... a mother deer and her fawn. I swerved to avoid them, and then I was in the trees. Miraculously, I survived the Alpine chaos, just to run straight into a pack of spring break skiers. I'm a ball of bindings and goggles. And when I finally came to rest, I looked up, and I... I saw an angel. Oh, my goodness. Tracey! Why didn't you tell me about this? It was just a work thing, you know? - Team building. - Mm. Hmm. - Hmm. - So, she rescued you? It's perfect. - Yes. - Perfect. The, uh... the, uh, consulting came later. You don't speak like an accountant. Hmm. I'm gonna refill the teapot. Rob... darling, how about a tour of the kitchen? Of course, my love. Let's go right now. What on earth are you doing? Oh, just a little improvising. Improvising? Oh, come on, Tracey. This is Margaret Westmoreland. She doesn't want tax returns and office parties. Okay. Listen, Rob. I'm not paying you to be James Bond, or Heathcliff, or the king of Siam. I'm paying you to be Robert Jones, accountant, and my fiancé. If you could just stick to the script for the next hour, we can wrap this up, and both get back to our own lives. Okay? Understood. I apologize. It won't happen again. Okay. Thank you. "Young man, you're simply too short." He pops on the casting director's high heel shoes, turns to me, and said, "How do you like me now?" Unbelievable! I didn't realize you had a say in casting. How many of your books did they adapt? Oh, I don't know. A dozen, I think. Simply amazing. Well, we could listen to Grama's old Hollywood stories all night long, but... we should probably let you get some rest. Nonsense! I was thinking of putting some music on. Perhaps finding out if this young man knows how to tango. Mm. Tracey's probably right. I got two left feet anyway. Happy wife, happy life, huh? Indeed. Well, I can certainly see that. I may not be here for the day... Grams, come on. But I will rest easy, knowing she's happy. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Goodbye, darling. - Mm. Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow, Grams, okay? Okay. Someone's birthday? Oh, no. I didn't think you were the marrying type. Carl. Well... Oh, I can't wait to meet him at the engagement party. Engagement party? - Yeah. - What? Who said anything about an engagement party? Your grandmother. Yeah, she called me last night. Maggie called you? Yeah. She told me everything. I just think it's wonderful, Tracey! I haven't heard her that happy in... years. I, for one, think this is great news. It's like the whole office is ecstatic. Oh. It's exactly what we all needed. Just to see Maggie again. Oh! Oh! You couldn't have planned it any better. Hey, girlfriend. How come your best friend is the last person to hear about all this? Hmm? Come here. Who's question mark? Get in here! Ouch. Okay. I'm not engaged. What? What are you talking about? It's all over the office. I hired a guy. Okay, what? No, no. Not like that. My grandmother is dying. Don't say that! It's the truth, Shelley. I went to go see her last week. We got on the marriage argument again. She just about keeled over right there. I panicked, and I blurted out that I'm engaged. You lied to your grandmother? I tried to tell you. And you said all that stuff about white lies and good medicine. Well, that's a little more grey than white. Yeah. Well, then she wanted to meet him. So, I called this rent-a-groom place. Rent a groom? I'll explain later. But just... you can't tell anyone. Please, Shelley... Okay, okay. I get it. Okay, look. As far as this office is concerned, this engagement is real. All right. I'll play along for Maggie's sake. I just hope you know what you're doing. So do I. So, is he cute? ♪ I'm going through changes ♪ ♪ It's going faster... ♪ I'm sorry. I'm sure this will be the last time. I just... I need you there tonight. - Thanks. - Thank you. The whole office? So, we have a full house tonight. It's just a quick, little thing at a restaurant. Ah, Dinner Theatre. The blue rinse crowd. Try the buffet. Got it. I need you on your best behavior. No improv, right? Tax returns all the way. Okay. So, tonight, eight o'clock, Hollingsworth's. Um, no. No. So, we... we... we can't go there. I used to work there. It's her favorite place. Well, someone will recognize me. It'll blow my cover for sure. You're that famous, huh? There's this great little French bistro, Annabelle's, over on the East Side. Tell her it was our first date place. She'll love it. You are creative. I will give you that. Just a little improvising. All right. I'll make the arrangements. Just make sure you pick me up on time. Haven't missed a curtain call yet. You look lovely. Thank you. You look lovely, too. A lovely couple then. Well, gotta look the part, right? Like you said, "Gotta look the part, right?" It's on loan from a... a good friend. I get it. It's a... it's a prop. Yeah, yeah. Something like that. Try it on. There. Now, we both have our motivation for the next scene. Thank you. I'm so excited. Oh, really? There they are. You look breathtaking! She's all yours. Um, Grams. Where did this new wardrobe come from? This old frock? I wore it to my last book signing in New York. I'm pulling out all the stops. Maggie, you look heavenly. Aw. Speaking of, this Annabelle gal... I'm sorry about the last-minute switch. Oh, not at all. I've been going to Hollingsworth's for years. And this place, talk about enchanted. Wherever did you find it? Sometimes, you just stumble upon something, and you... you fall in love. Well, if the house sparkling is any indication, it's love at first sight. Such a gentleman. This is lovely. Oh, here, let me. Just two red wines, please. Uh, thank you. - Maggie. - Thank you. Yes, yes, yes. Ladies and gentlemen. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you my granddaughter Tracey and her fiancé Rob. I've written many stories in my time. And I've sent many characters on wile adventures, looking for love. But it's often when we stop searching for something that we find it. So, I'd like to propose a toast. To letting love find you. - Here. - Thank you. I think you could use a drink. Yeah. The mystery man at last. Shelley. This is my fiancé, Rob. Rob, this is my best friend, Shelley. The one with the big mouth. I've heard all about you. I didn't know accountants were so good-looking. Uh, Shelley, dear. I don't think this fine restaurant wants to be the scene of a murder tonight. Oh, my good God! What? This ring. It's enough to make a girl weak in the knees. It's just a prop. It could've fooled me. Yes. Well, maybe you should go rest your weak knees. Keep your mouth shut, okay? Don't worry about me. I'll keep my mouth shut. Listen, are you available the next couple of weeks? I have this ex-boyfriend I wanna drive crazy... Shelley! Okay. Hi! Hey, Shelley. They invited you. What was that about? She knows. Knows what? Tracey, you look... delicious. - Okay. - Todd. This is my fiancé, Rob. Rob. Mm. It is truly an honor to meet the man who, uh, melted the ice queen's heart. So, seriously, how'd you do it? No, no. Let me guess. You're a crown prince, heir to the throne of Moravia, and, uh, gave it all up for love. No. Afraid not. Oh, well, I got it. You are a secret agent, masquerading as an international playboy. You're hiding here until the heat blows over, and Tracey here is your cover. That sounds a lot like the plot to my third novel, Todd. You wanna be careful I don't sue you for plagiarism. Oh, Maggie. May I just say on behalf of the entire Barmont Publishing family how truly honored it is to have you here this evening, and looking so radiant. Why, thank you, Todd. Perhaps I'll have you deliver my eulogy. Maggie... don't even talk like that. Of course, I'd be honored to, uh, read at your funeral... Cool your jets, Todd. I'll probably screw everything up, and outlive all of you. Oh, Maggie. Dinner is served. Yum. I guess I've always had a thing for numbers. A passion really. And most kids hate the idea that math is all around us. It's in the portions of food on your dinner plate. The number of friends and family you can sit around the table. The number of beats per minute of the heart of a man madly in love. Well, there's... there's a pureness to math. And a beauty. You know, a certain completeness in combination. The sum is greater than its parts. You sure don't talk like an accountant. Accountant, right. I still like the international playboy angle. Nope. Numbers guy. Oh, okay, Mr. Einstein. Hey, Rob, what firm did you say you were working for again? Robinson & Younger. Is that right? You know, I think I know a couple of guys over there. What's the manager's name again? Let's not bore the party with... Roger. Roger McLaren. Roger. Right. Right. So, he would know you. That's highly unlikely. They don't let me out of the cellar very often. No. To be honest, I haven't had much of a chance to mingle since transferring here from Chicago. Oh, sure, sure. Of course, of course. But you've been doing some consulting with our company. Did you know that, Carl? Oh. I don't really handle the books. Oh, yes. Anyone actually seen this guy? Of course, Todd. - Really? - Yeah. I've corresponded with Rob a couple of times. I just never made the romantic connection. Chicago. Is that where you're from? Yes. Born and raised. I... I grew up around restaurants actually. My dad started out as a waiter at a little French place just like this. An engagement party would break his heart. Really? Oh, sure. He'd say, "There's one less bachelor come here to eat every night." He was a little old-fashioned. I see. After my mom died, he decided to open up a little place of his own. He did all right. But I saw the toll it took on him. Being the face of a business, it's hard on family life. People don't wanna see the waiters. They wanna see you. He was hoping that he'd hand the whole thing over to me, but... I went a different direction. Into the exciting world of numbers. Yeah. Yeah, something like that. But now, I'm... I'm ready for a new journey. I... I don't know if it was the moonlight, reflecting off the pool that lit up her eyes when I first saw them. Pool? I thought you were skiing. Skiing? The... the pool came after the skiing. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. We, um... I would just like to thank you all for being here this evening. This is as much for my grandmother as it is for us. Thank you, both of you. And with that, I'm afraid we must bid you all adieu. Mm. Okay. Darling, shall we? Of course. - Okay. - Nice to meet you all. - Bye. - And nice to meet you, Robert. Todd. What did I say about improvising? The pool was a little slip. A little slip. I just though we needed to get back to the romantic stuff. Oh, come on. The crowd was loving it. Hmm. I guess it did go over well. Thank you for the save on the accounting manager. I did not have that in the character profile. - Hey. I did my research. - Okay. - Tracey. - Todd. - Numbers guy. - Hi. Thanks for coming, Todd. It was a pleasure. You could've warned me about Todd. I'm sorry. Such a lovely evening. So, what have you planned for the wedding? I know Claude very well at the Somerset Tea House. It's such a romantic place. - It'd be perfect! - Mm. We were thinking of keeping it a small affair. Justice of the peace and a few friends. Hmm. I see. Well, I guess it shouldn't matter to me anyway. Well, it wouldn't hurt us just to look at the place. Oh, bless you, darling. I was hoping that you would say that. Allan and I can meet you there tomorrow at noon. We'd be delighted. Delighted. Very well. Onward, driver. But, of course, mademoiselle. I'll see you later! - Love you. - Love you, sweetie. What was that? This was supposed to be it. A couple weeks of joy. That's what you said. I'm game if you are. I'll even give you a discount. A discount. No skiing or pool stories, all right? Yes, dear. Don't "Yes, dear" me, Rob Jones. Good morning. Hi. Two milk, one sweetener, right? Yeah. How did you know that? Attention to detail. What are you doing here? I thought we'd do a little acting exercise. - Get in the character. - A what? Come on. Get your coat. Trust me, you'll love it. Okay. Can you tell me where we're going? Trust me. Okay. I had this bit part on this Western TV show a few years back. Mm-hmm. I played this juggler in this traveling group of performers. I had two lines. "The show must go on." And "Pardon me, ma'am, but I do believe your cow just ate one of my juggling clubs. I had three minutes of screen time, but I took three days, and I developed this... this whole backstory for this juggler. - Backstory? - Yeah. Like, well, how did he end up with this motley crew? And did he come from a long line of jugglers? Or did he earn a degree in projectile throwing from a prestigious juggling university? I... I even gave him this slight Swedish accent. I figured he grew up juggling pickled herrings. Oh, wow. It's called an origin story. You see, even though I only had a couple of lines and a... a few minutes' screen time, the backstory made the character more... more real, more... more alive. Even if you did stink of herring. Like, what about us, huh? What's our origin story? Oh. I think you rolled that out with your skiing-slash- pool party gig. Yeah. That's how we met, but who are we? Tell me about this Rob Jones guy. What attracted you to him? Uh, the usual things. He's honest, hard working. Sensible shoes. Sounds like a real prince charming. He, um... he has a nice smile. Really? Mm-hmm. And, um, a chihuahua named Louie. Yes. Now, we're talkin'! Okay. Well, what about this Tracey Westmoreland character? Hmm? Let's see. She... she does wear sensible shoes. But she's also got this gorgeous red pair of patent leather heels that she wears for special occasions. She works as an editor at a publishing firm, but she secretly wants to start a hippie commune in Oregon. I did spend a lot of time wandering the wilderness in my... in my youth. After my parents died, I, um... I closed myself off a little I guess. My grandmother was great. I mean... she just lost her son and her daughter-in-law, but... she stepped right in... with... unconditional love for a sad and angry 12-year-old girl. We should... we should probably get back to port. Don't wanna be late for the ball. Listen, Tracey, I... I wanted tell you... when I was telling about my mom last night, I... I meant no offense to your folks. It's all right, Rob. I know. Sometimes life is a series of... half truths. I know. Maybe Rob Jones knows a little bit more about life than just sensible shoes. Maybe. He... he does know what it's like to be a... a sad and an angry little kid. My mom really did die... when I was nine. Come on. I don't wanna leave Maggie standing at the altar. Good morning. And welcome to the Somerset Tea House. Are you here for tea or a tour? We're meeting someone for a tour. Oh. Forgive me. It's Tracey, isn't it? Yeah. - Oh, my. Your grandmother. - How is she? Better. We're meeting her here. And you're considering having your ceremony here? Wonderful! It's just a tour. Well... may I be so bold as to confess that your love for one another simply radiates from your very beings? It's that obvious, huh? - Good morning, lovers! - Good morning, lovers! Maggie. My little dance routine last night reminded me I still need my wheels now and then. - Mm. - Mm. Hello, Claude. Oh, Mrs. Westmoreland. May I say what an honor it is for us to host you. This will be an event to remember. It's just a tour. Wonderful! Feel free to make yourselves at home. Roam the grounds at your leisure. We can't wait to help you celebrate your magical day! Well, we're just heading up for another service this afternoon. I will be in the event room if you have any questions. Right. Let's go out into the sunshine. Onward, driver. But, of course, mademoiselle. Wonderful. - It's beautiful. - Simply beautiful. It certainly is. Would you two kids mind doing me a favor? What's that, Grams? Could you just stand over there? You know, so I could just take a picture. Grama, really? Maggie, we'd be delighted. Stop it. Well, here we at. - It's Chad. - It really is quite magical. Yeah, wish I could do a disappearing trick right now. Smile. Mm. Oh, my God. It is him. I'm so embarrassed. - Oh. - But I just had to meet you. Are you coming back for a second season? Second season of what? Sinners of the City. Chad the mechanic! Ladies, I'm sorry. I'm not... I'm not who you think I am. You were so sexy. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm not who you think I am. Ladies, ladies. You were so... Ladies, please. Please. - Oh, my God. - I can't believe it. Sinners of the City? It was a bit part. A terrible show a couple years back. I totally forgot about it. Well, let's hope we don't run into anymore "Chad" fans. Oh, my goodness. Look at this chair. This is incredible. Hello. May I? - Really? - Yeah. - I got it. - No, I got it. - I got it! - I got it. - Oh, you got it. - Thank you. Oh, and it goes backwards, are you kidding me? Careful. Let's really take this for a spin. Let's get the cars. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! - It's okay. Let's go. - He does this every day. What? Yeah. He, like, volunteers. And this I believe is your stop, my lady? Let's get in the car. - So comfortable. - Okay. - Ooh! - Slowly. Oh. - Ah, yeah. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, all right, sweetie. I'll call you. I'd like to have you both over for dinner again soon. Maximize my time with you. Sounds good, Grams. Feet in. Take care, Tracey. And, Rob. I kinda wanna call you Chad now. Chad! You can't... get outta here. I totally forgot about that. It wasn't supposed to come out till next week. So, you model as well? Oh. Thank God they haven't seen the commercial. An ad campaign and a commercial! Are they spinning this into a mini-series as well? Do you have any sunglasses? What for? To hide your face? Look, I'm a working actor. What am I supposed to do? I'm not responsible for reruns and ad campaigns. I just don't like surprises. Well, it's been a while since I've to submit a resumé for a job, but I can assure you it's a rambling list of corny commercials and cop number two guys. I can't help it if Chad the mechanic pops up every once in a while. Lisen, um... I really do appreciate everything you're doing for my grandmother. I know this must be tough for you. But if you need me, I'll be there... for both of you. Hold onto it... for now. Thanks, Rob. Hey! There's little miss fix it. Hello, Todd. How was your hangover? - It was great. - Thank you for asking. How was the weekend with the crown prince? He's an accountant. - Oh, right! - I'm sorry I keep forgetting. You know what's weird is I actually phoned over to Robinson & Younger, and they've never heard of a Rob Jones. I'm sure if someone were to call Barmont Publishing and ask for a Todd Pearlman, they might get a similar response. That's not true. Look, maybe I don't wanna see you get hurt, okay? I think you're makin' a big mistake. Okay. He's an accountant you like numbers, okay? I get it. But I know numbers, you know? I... what number am I thinking about right now? One. Lucky guess. See, we're succinct. We're... Todd. This has been super fun. Tracey, I can give you numbers. Trace? Shelley, did you miss me? Got some beaters for our in-house grease monkey. Hello, Miss Miracle Worker! Got some clunkers, and they're out of gas. He was telling the truth. Come again. Rob. He was telling the truth about his upbringing in Chicago. Oh, yeah? Wow. He is prolific. Is Chad the mechanic on there? I don't know. But look at this. Look at his bio. Born in Chicago. Mom died when he was very young. Raised by his father, and like most aspiring actors, he waited tables. Mm-hmm. He was telling the truth. What? You're falling for this guy. What? No, of course, not. No. Yes, you are. I've never seen you look at a real guy like that, let alone a picture of one. Don't be ridiculous. I'll admit he's... he's cute. He definitely looks the part. I'll give him that. He's an actor after all. So? I'm just saying, you can't believe everything you read on the web, especially on an actor's bio. He's actually very sweet, too. True. He's a real Romeo. And you make a great Juliet. Stop. O Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou, Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Not a lot of people know the next line of that speech. Classically trained. Sorry, I was in the neighborhood. Can I take you for lunch? I wanna ask you something. That's up to her! I could eat, but whatever. Okay, bye-bye. Yeah, yeah. I... I would love to eat. I'll just get my bag. Can I ask you something? Shoot. Are you really from Chicago? I am. So, the other night at the party when you were talking about your past, your mom and dad... were you telling the truth? I was. I just figured it was easier that way. I realized I might have been going off script, but it just... it felt right. Honestly, it was... it was nice. See, sometimes, acting's all about improvising. If things change, then you... you roll with it. Mm. And if your partner has a great idea, you go with it. It's called... chemistry. Hmm. Like Laurel and Hardy, or Newman and Redford. Bogey and Bacall. Exactly. So, what did you... what did you wanna ask me? I just wanted float something past you. I mean, you have this knack for problem-solving. Mm-hmm. They don't call me the fix-it gal for nothing. Even if it's crazy, and it doesn't make any sense? But when you think about it, it kinda does? Yeah. I mean, life is crazy, right? A lot of things in life don't, I mean, make sense. Okay. Here goes. I'm going to be a dad... I hope. What? In a streaming series. A part. Oh! My agent just called. They wanna see an audition tape. It's a tiny part, but it's recurring... if I get it. A part. Yeah. Hey. But they shoot the pilot here. Oh, really? Yeah. Then it's just back to LA. I just don't know whether I should send the tape in or not. I'm done with rejection, you know? Mm. Mm-hmm. But it's not a mechanic. It's a cop show. Would you read it? You know, as an editor, you could tell me what you think of this guy. You know, how I should approach this character. - Sure. - Really? Because I was thinking of packing this whole acting thing, and, you know, maybe become a real accountant. No, Rob. If... if the part's good, I'm... I'm happy for you. I know you'd understand. You know, Joe Pesci was going to quit acting right before he got Raging Bull? - Really? - Hmm. Didn't know that before. Maybe I could stop by your office this afternoon with... with the script. Yeah. Sure. Tracey, Tracey, Tracey. Tracey. Do you ever work? Oh, I've been working. Fact-checking on your boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Pull up his bio. There, look. Oh, wait. Look. What? Remember what he said about his dad? He was a waiter in a French restaurant, and he opened up a little place of his own. He did all right. His father is Arthur Hollingsworth. Founder and CEO of the chain of Hollingsworth's fine-dining restaurants. Okay. So? So? It means he's loaded. Why would he lie about that? It's not exactly a lie. More of an act. Hi, my name's Rob. I'm not a real serial killer, but I play one on TV. - Boo! - Ah! I'm so sorry. Hello, Shelley. Oh. We have to stop meeting like this. Robert Jones, hello. - Back to my fact-checking. - Mm. You up for a read? So, I thought we could run some lines even if you don't mind playing a gum-smacking waitress. I'm the hitman who knocked you up. But I'm trying to go straight. Can I ask you something personal? Who's improvising now? Tell me about that restaurant that your dad opened. My dad? Yeah. I saw the photo buried in your bio page. You and your dad, it was a recent picture. You know you pay an agent to update those things. Is your dad Arthur Hollingsworth? Yes. And why does that matter? Because my dad is Arthur Hollingsworth. Imagine being the son of one of the most successful restaurateurs in the country. Then imagine saying "No" to that fortune when it was offered to you. Sounds a lot like being the granddaughter of one of the greatest romance novelists of the 20th century. Exactly. I spent most of my life in that shadow, and it was awfully cold there. So, I decided to step out into the light and just happened to be in the light of the stage, Well, a prominent name could have opened doors for you. If I'm gonna make it, I wanted it to be because I earned it. Not because who my father is. There's no shame in that. Oh, it's Maggie. Hello. - Hey, hon. Got a minute? - Yes. What are you doing? Actually, we're just having a drink. Is everything okay? Yes. Can I see you? - Sure. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, I'll be there. Say "Hi" to Rob. Yes. I'll tell him you say "Hello." Okay, bye, hon. Okay, bye. Maggie is coming to the office tomorrow. A big announcement. Thanks for hearing me out. Thanks for being honest. I'm afraid I've done something crazy. What are you talking about? Completely selfish, I know. What's going on? I spoke with Claude. Went by a few days ago to pay for the attack of the Chad fans in the gazebo. - Okay. - And something struck me. Just felt right. Grama, what have you done? I booked a wedding rehearsal for you and Rob. A dress rehearsal really. You're kidding. Maggie! What a pleasant surprise. What's going on? They're having a wedding dress rehearsal. - Wait... - That's wonderful! What's so wonderful? Oh. Uh, Tracey and Rob are having a wedding dress rehearsal. Oh, yippee! I'm sorry, sweetie. I should have spoken to you. I know you both want a small ceremony. And you can still have it. This way, no matter what happens, I can say I was there with you. Oh, Grama. I'm just asking for this one thing. The rest is up to you, I promise. Okay, Grama. And you're all invited. This Saturday at the Somerset Tea House. And I want you all in your Sunday best. Whoo! You know, this is just like the surprise marriage in the fifth Cassandra novel. Remember, where she falls for the Swedish prince! - Yeah. - Oh! It's a regular, old fairy-tale. Mm-hmm. We don't have to do this, Tray. It's my grandmother's dying wish, Shelley. Sure. One last show then. Maybe. Maybe? What if it's not a show? What do you mean? Rob wants to meet to discuss some big news. So, you have fallen in love with this guy. I don't know. Maybe I have. I guess she likes insurance ads. Actually, it's the series, I guess, Sinners of the City. It's been streaming nonstop online. Oh, that reminds me. I have not had a chance to read Walk the Talk. But I think you would make a wonderful hitman-slash- long-distance daddy. - Thank you. - Yep. Though as a working mom, I would not consider that a stable job for a child. Well, that's kinda what I wanna talk to you about. What kind of a career can an actor carve out in this city, you know, without going to LA? It's very tough. Which leads me to my big announcement. I think she brought friends. - Run! - Ooh! I love you, Chad! We love you! My agent told me there's even an online petition to bring Chad back. No. Although, I did die in a horrible dishwasher accident. Wow! I think we may have lost them. - Okay. - Here. Come on here. I wanna tell you something. Oh. Speaking of jobs, my grandmother has one more favor to ask of you. - Hmm. - She's booked a dress rehearsal for the wedding. A dress rehearsal? But I thought we were having a small ceremony. I mean, Rob and Tracey Jones, that is. Hmm. We are. And that's the story. It's kind of a... Like a wedding gift, I guess. It's more for her really. And, hey, if you're gonna have a wedding, why not have the greatest living romance novelist planning it for you? Well, that's exciting. Mm-hmm. But I think I have you beat. Really? I'm not gonna be a dad anymore. Oh! Broke up with the waitress already, huh? The pilot, it got picked up, and they want me for the lead. Rob! What? I have a wardrobe fitting on Saturday. We shoot here for a couple weeks, and then it's off to LA. Oh, my goodness! Wow! That's... that's incredible. But the dress rehearsal's on Saturday. Well, maybe we can postpone it. Maggie's already paid for everything. But... but this is it. This is my Joe Pesci moment. Mm. No, wait. Wait, Tracey. I'm sure we can work it out. Don't worry about it, Rob. I'll figure something out. No, listen, Tracey. I'll call my agent. We'll postpone the wardrobe fitting. I'll be there. I guess that means you'll be relocating to LA now, right? Well, I have to for the show. But Saturday, I'll... I'll be there. I... I promise. One last performance, right? Hi. I feel like such a fool. I mean, rent a groom. The name says it all. He plays the romantic lead in a lot of girls' fantasies. I mean, I hired him to play that part. It was fun... playing a couple. I just thought it... might become something more. You got caught up in the show. I don't blame you. - Right? - Yeah. Well... we just have to get through one last performance, and I can write him back out of my life. Hello, Rob. Dad. Been a long time. There years this May. You all right? Yeah. Actually, I'm really good. You had dinner? I'm not staying long. Drink then. Sure. Thank you for coming. Take care. So, what are you drinkin'? Club soda's just fine for me. Two club sodas, please. Of course. Listen, I didn't come here to fight. I came here because I wanted to tell you two things. Okay. First... I'm an actor. I know. I've seen the insurance commercial. No, no, no. Not that stuff. A real actor. I got a part. A lead part in a series. It's a great part. It's what I've been working for my whole life. Congratulations. I'm happy for you. Here's your drinks. You are? Of course! All I've ever asked from you is you work hard for whatever it is you want. For me, it's this place, you know? I was hoping the dream could be shared. Turned into more of a wedge. I mean, I guess you had a right to push me away. - I didn't push you away. - Oh. Three years of the silent treatment is not exactly a gentle nudge. I said I didn't come here to argue. Well... why are you here? I wanted to talk to you about the ring. - The ring? - Yes. Mom's ring. Mom's ring. I've met someone, Dad. Mom's ring. So, it's serious? Yes. I'm in love. That look on my face when I met your mom. You are so much like her. You follow your heart. Oh, she would be so proud of you right now. I miss her. I miss her, too. Just make sure you keep following your heart. It led you through these doors. Looks like it led you into someone else's heart. So, when do I get to meet her? Well, if all goes well, I'll need a table for two for Saturday night. Whoo! Are you trying to set a world record? I'm invincible. You say that now. Hi. My name's Trevor. Turn that up. I was once just like you, not sure which insurance plan was right for me and my family. But now that I'm with Stanfield Insurance, we all sleep better at night. Because in life, you just never know when to expect the unexpected. - Stanfield Insurance. - We expect the unexpected. Do you know that guy? I know him, too. Only his name ain't Trevor. It's Brad. See, a while back, I was trying to get back with my ex-girlfriend. And then this guy shows up, and she says he's her fiancé. Only... yeah, he wasn't. Turns out, she hired this guy to act like her fiancé. They call it Rent-a-Groom. You call them, and then they show up and ruin your life. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. There! Oh, I got you. I got you. Oh, you're going down. You're going down! Okay. Hey. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter? You worried about the wedding rehearsal tomorrow? Oh, no. Everything's perfect. Dress was bought, flowers are ordered. My groom is leaving for LA. Yeah, no. Everything's going according to plan. Whoa. You want him to stay? I want him to want to stay. So, you're upset because you fell in love with him? I fell in love with him by mistake. And that's his fault? Well, now's your chance to blast him with the truth. He's in the boardroom waiting for you. Rob's here? Yes. Tell him, Tracey. Well, what if it doesn't change anything? Well, what if it does? It's called Rent-a-Groom. Rent-a-Groom? You aren't a gigolo, are you? Dad, no. It's not like that. People... well, women pay me to pretend to be their love interests. But you say you quit. This morning. How long were you doing this? Three years. Three very long years. I think I've been engaged maybe 20 times. And I've had some doozies. But it's finally over. This endless acting. You know how hard it is to fake being madly in love? I mean, I'm a good actor, but, whoo. And then there's engagement party. And all her little friends. I tell you, it's agony. It's just this part I'm playing. It doesn't mean anything. And I'm tired of pretending that it does. I can't wait to tell her. I'm ready for the real thing. - Well, son, - I think you definitely made the right decision. Thanks, Dad. And thanks for calling. Bye, son. - Tracey, hey. - I waited at the office. Connie said you had to step out to take a... Tracey, please call me. I'd really love to talk about... Hey, Tracey. It's Rob again. Um, I'm not sure if I did something to upset you. But, uh, if we could meet... Good afternoon, folks. And, Maggie, you look absolutely gorgeous. Thank you, Rob. You don't look so bad yourself. Oh, well, it is a special day. Have you seen Tracey? Oh, no. Rob, it's... bad luck to see the bride before the wedding. I don't think a dress rehearsal wedding counts, sweetheart. She's inside. Thank you, Maggie. Well, we'll see you all after the big moment. Oh. Everything is perfect. I couldn't have written this better myself. Good luck. Hey. You're not supposed to be here. I'm sorry, I know. Give me that. You look absolutely stunning. Just getting in the costume. I half expected you to send a stand-in. No. I said I'd be here, didn't I? Five minutes to curtain. Can I talk to you about something? There you go. Getting off script again. No improvising, remember? Or are you directing this show as well? Places, everyone. We can't keep Maggie waiting. Well, can we talk after? Just hit your mark, and say your lines. We can wrap this whole thing up. Oh, my goodness. I am excited... and nervous. This is not my real job, you understand? But I have always wanted to do this. And when Margaret Westmoreland asked me to preside, well... Shh! Hi, darling. - Excited? - Mm-hmm. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Robert Jones and Tracey Westmoreland. Marriage is a sacred bond. A commitment to one another, born from the seed of destiny, nurtured with true love, to blossom into the flower of matrimony. Before we proceed, I must ask you both if there is any impediment to this union. Actually, there is something I'd like to say. -Tracey- -I object! I object, because this man is an actor. Oh, my God. It's true. I'm not really a justice of the peace. Not you, idiot. Him! - Todd! - His real name is Robert J. Hollingsworth. He works for an outfit called Rent-a-Groom. Tracey, what's he on about? Tracey hired this guy to fool Maggie. Tracey, is this true? Yes. It's true. Grams, I'm so sorry. I never meant for it to go this far, but now that it has, I'm glad this little charade is over. Charade? Is that all this had been to you? Yeah, Rob. It was just a part I'm playing. It doesn't mean anything. I'm tired of pretending that it does. - Hey, Tracey. Wait, wait... - No, no, no. No, no. Wait, please. Tray. Maggie, I am so, so truly sorry. No, I'm sorry. This is all my fault. The ring that is on Tracey's hand... it belonged to my mother. I was gonna give it to Tracey for real this time. But I can see now that that's not what she wants. These last few days have been filled with a few half-truths, but there is one thing that is... very real. I truly love your granddaughter. Walk away! Maggie! Maggie! Maggie? Maggie? Maggie? Give me a hand. Hey, Tray. How's the new batch of jalopies? Any word about your grandma? It's been two weeks since she collapsed. Doctors are trying to stay optimistic, but... I can't help thinking... I did this. No, Tracey. Don't say that. I thought it would make her happy. I thought... It's the hospital. Grandma. How are you? Ring. Ring? Oh, right, the prop ring. I totally forgot about it. Yeah. I think I threw it in my purse. You wanna see it? Yeah? Okay. It should be in here somewhere. You're right. I should probably mail it back to him. Or directly to the prop house he got it from. Not a prop. It's real. His mother's. I don't understand. Find his father. Oh. Can I help you? Yes. Are you Arthur Hollingsworth? I am. Mr. Hollingsworth, my name is... Tracey Westmoreland. Yes. You look exactly as Rob described you. I think I have something that belongs to you. I've not seen that in a long time. Let's grab a seat. It belonged to my wife. Lucille. When she passed away, Rob asked if he could have it. He said he wanted to put it on the finger of the girl he loved. I guess he found her. I called him the day before your dress rehearsal... to ask him if he was sure. That kid's never been more sure of anything in his life. He even quit that Rent-a-Groom job. He did? That very morning. He said they were parts he was playing. He was tired of pretending. Said he wanted to make it real. And he wanted to make it real with you. Can I ask you, Tracey... why the cold feet? I think I heard the wrong end of that phone call earlier. Hold onto it. Thank you. Aw, sweetie. Well, did I miss anything while I was away? Grams. Did you find his father? Yes. And the ring? I have it. Grams. I never meant to hurt you. Oh. Listen, kiddo. I've written enough romance novels in my time to know what true love looks like. I think I may have believed your story because you were falling in love. You can't fake that. So, I have one question for you. Yes? Why are you still sitting here? Hmm? Tracey. I don't know where they're shooting, but I know they wrap today. - Then... - He leaves for LA. Hi. Hi. How did you find me? Shelley told me you were here. Maggie, is she all right? She had an accident. Right after you left the dress rehearsal... - Oh, no. - She's all right. She... she just woke up. She filled me in... on this. I went to see your dad. You did? He told me everything. But you're still here. The show, I thought it went to LA. Yeah, it did without me. I quit. - But, Rob... - Tracey. I thought this was my big break, but I realized over these last few days... you... you've been my big break all along. And I've been racking my brain on the drive over here how to play the scene where I run across town and find the beautiful book editor, and tell her how madly in love I am with her. I think I can help you run some lines. What do I do with this? Hold on to it. It'll play in the later scene.
