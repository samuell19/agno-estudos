In this life, Savannah had only encountered two phenomena with unequivocal rarity and beauty. The first was the magical glow of the blue moon, so named for its scarcity. It appeared only once or twice every two or three years. And the other was love, an even rarer occurrence, ignited by the passion of a man named linden. However, even the truest devotion can be threatened by ambition, and for Savannah, this coursed through her veins like a fire that refuse to dim. - I love you. - On the strike of midnight, it would be time for her to choose... Between her heart's comfort or destiny unknown. She could have one but never both. As she disappeared into the night to the sound of pounding hooves on cobblestone, Savannah pulls off her heels and she turns for one last glimpse of her true love. Now that's how you finish a book! Wouldn't you say, grace? - I know! I did it once, I can do it again. - Uh-uh! Hello! Where's the fire? Come on, I'm not feeling it! - Maybe I have nothing left to say about love. It's not like romance is the only genre out there. Mysteries are always popular. - Your deadline is in 10 days, and we're paying you for the third book in this trilogy, so you better find something worth saying about romance. I'm gonna be frank. Your book sales have dropped significantly in the last quarter. If this book doesn't hit the bestseller list, we won't be extending your contract. - I'll get the pages out to you, okay? I'll force them out one way or another. - No, you're not gonna force anything. You're gonna weave a tapestry of love and passion that ends this trilogy was such fierce emotion people are gonna be buying your book for the next 10 years. - Fierce emotions. Gotcha. - Yes! You know, get a change of scenery. Ask someone on a date. - Wanna go on a date? - Not me, but I like the confidence. - Ooh! How 'bout him? - How'd you even know that was in there? - Do you think I would have forgotten about your muse when you, a lowly, unpublished writer approached me with the most heartfelt manuscript I'd ever set my eyes on? - Sean's irrelevant. He broke up with me, remember? - No, you broke up with him because he was being distant. - Same thing! He's probably often in Europe researching catacombs or imagining the next Eiffel Tower. - What's this? - What? The blue moon ball. - Um... It's just a hometown event that happens every few years. Flyer I used to think was meaningful. - Used to? Sounds quaint. - Ancient history now. - Grace, stop waiting for the moment's stars to align. Take action in your life! Fight for your love! I need you to think about where your heart was when you first met Sean, when you first fell in love with him. Go there and write. Okay? - My book signing! - Hey. - Hi! So nice to meet a fellow rom reader. - Actually, I'm just looking for some books on isometrics. Oh. Oh! - I am so sorry! Are you all right? I'm fine. - I am such a klutz. Hopefully my patients never find out. Um... I'm really sorry, again. Have a good evening. - Um, I mean, I am a little bruised. Nothing a book sale wouldn't fix. - Well, I can't say I've ever read a romance novel. Is this one any good? - Only if you like your passion red hot. - Sounds like I could get burned if I'm not careful. - So you're a doctor? - Resident currently, so I'm good with burns. - Well, what do you residents like to do for fun? - Fun hasn't come up much lately. We do enjoy an occasional brunch. - Me too! Maybe the author of "river romance" would be open to discussing her novel over mimosas some time? - She might be. - James. - James? - Strong name. - Thank you. - I'll just... Give you my number. - Ciao. - That was a hot tamale! Nicely done, dear! - Okay. - It's quite nippy out there tonight. Keeping people inside, I think. Leaving already? - Yes. Thank you you so much for letting me use your store, ester. - Nevermind about the turnout. You're a great writer! - Thank you. - I want you to come back here for your next book launch. - If I have one. - You will! Just don't give up. That's the secret to anything worthwhile, because, you know, everyone loves a happy ending. - Me too. What? - Oh! - Pinch me! I'm dreaming! - Hi, mom. - I can't believe you're really here! And just in time! How serendipitous. - It was kind of a last-minute decision. - Well, I'll take it. Come on, let's get you in the house. - I miss this place. I wish I could transplant it back to la. - Well, la may have skyscrapers and strip malls, but it doesn't have the blue moon ball. - Please, that's so far away, it's the last thing on my mind. - What do you mean? I assumed you knew the blue moon is this Friday. - It can't be! It's supposed to be another five years until the next blue moon. - That's how long you've been away. - Really? It feels like no time at all. - Well, the good news is you're back, and this is gonna be a very special year, where the blue moon falls on the same night as the harvest moon. I thought you knew. - I'm sorry I've been away for so long. But I'm really happy I'm not missing this. - You work too hard in that career of yours. You have always been single-minded, and I am so glad that you finally took some time for yourself. But if you didn't know about the ball, what brought you back home? My agent suggested it. He wanted me to return to the place where I first learned about love. - Back to your mom, who's the person who loves you the most in the world. - Exactly. Well, I should get to bed. I've got a full day of work tomorrow. - Okay. I'm gonna make this trip extra inspirational. - Thanks, mom. - I'm gonna start with baking. - Yes! - Okay.

Hey. - Grace! Grace, grace, grace, grace, grace girl, did I ever miss you! - I missed you too. So much missing. - See my truck on your way in? I just got new mud tires on her. Can you believe it? - Wow. That must've cost you an arm and a leg. - Boyfriend's leg, not mine. I'm so glad to see that you made it back, just in time, too. - I know. For the ball, right? - Oh, sure. If that even happens, they'll probably have the permits to tear this old heap of timber down by then. - Tear it down? - Yeah, for the new shopping complex! This is prime real estate, you know. Location, location, location. You'd me a perfect person to write an article on it! Yeah, it would bring some hype to the mega mall! Or is that beneath you? You are little miss famous now, aren't you? I have both your novels on my bedside table. - You've read my books? - Read them? I inhaled them! I was so relieved when Savannah finally left Lyndon to go pursue her own career, and she can finally start dating men of a higher caliber and tax bracket, if you know what I mean. - Yeah. Well, my characters await, so... I should get back to it. - Of course. But I wouldn't recommend doing it here. The contractor's in and out all day. - Right, for the much needed shopping mall. - Exactly. - Yeah. Lyndon and Savannah's stroll through the Rose garden became a march down blame Lane. "I can't believe you'd tear down the walls of our love without so much as running the idea by me first," Savannah snaps. - Grace. - "It's just a building, Ramona. I knew you'd say no, so I made an executive decision," Lyndon replies. "What gives you the right?" - Grace! - I'm sorry, I'm try- Sean. - Sorry, I just heard your voice and underwent a... Minor heart attack. - Were you sitting there the whole time? At our tree? - Is this... Our tree? It is, I... No, no, no, I was... On a work break and I decided to get some fresh air. - Right. Wait, you work here? Yeah, I got my master's in architecture, and then, what would you know, first job I land is right back at home. - Building the new shopping complex! I heard. - No, no, no. I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen. I'm trying to get the old mansion deemed historic and save it. - Really? That's amazing! Uh... Sorry, I kind of went a little crazy when Heather told me they were tearing it down. - Heather told you? - Can you believe it? She actually sounded excited about it too. Same country Princess as always. - She was a sucker for outlet stores. - So does this mean you're gonna the blue moon ball? - I haven't missed one yet. Are you going? - I am now. - I'm really glad that I ran into you. Or bothered you. - At least some things never changed. - You look really good. - I am really good. - I think you're supposed to say that... I look really good too. - Isn't that a given? - Well, I've... Got to get back to work. I got to find grounds to deem the mansion historic, then write a 20-page proposal. - Save the blue moon ball. - Exactly! So... I'll see you around, I guess? - Maybe. Danny, hey. - Hey. Can you come to my office? I want to talk about the book signing. I heard through the grapevine that after selling one book, you proceeded to pack up early. Tell me the grapevine lies. - I did. You told me to go to the place where I first fell in love, so I flew home last night. - Flew home? I was talking about in your mind, not on a plane. - Oops. - Well, you're there now, I suppose. Getting lots of writing done? - Tons! - Great. Send me the pages by Friday. - Prepare to be amazed. - You know, in this profession, I prepare for the worst and I pray for slightly better. Bye, grace. - By- - Joe, come here! Sean! - Hey, Heather. How was your day? - Oh, good as good can be. Spent most of it at the riding club, practicing dressage with star. I'm gonna need new gloves soon. - My day was good too. Thanks for asking. - Somebody's grumpy. - I heard you've been talking up the shopping mall, which seems a little strange, given that it's my job to make sure that doesn't happen. - It's your first job, baby boo. A practice run. Besides, you know how proud my daddy's gonna be when you declare that site a tear-down. - Thanks for the vote of confidence, but this mansion is really important to me. It's a link to some of this town's most important history. It's not a tear-down. - I love that you always think with your heart, it's the perfect balance to overly logical me, who has no choice but to point out that old house hasn't been used in who knows how long. It's a financial black hole. That's why the Cassidys are finally dropping it. - You know, I heard they're living in the suburbs somewhere back east. The suburbs! Poor things. People will come shopping here every day from all over the county and beyond. It'll increase our town's economy tenfold. - You know, I didn't need your dad to give me this job. I can stand on my own two feet. Of course you can, sweetie. - You ever gonna stay at your own place? - Why would I do that, silly? I make this place just barely livable. Dinner will be ready in fine - Well! If it isn't my goddaughter! Sheriff Carson. How are you doing, sweetie? - When I heard you were back in town, I decided to camp out in your mom's kitchen. That way you have no choice but to say howdy. - Camp out means eat the fridge. - Best fridge in town. - Well, I'd never come home without visiting the best storyteller in town. - Um... How did the writing go? Did you manage to stay incognito? - As if. I had to personally introduce myself as the great-great-granddaughter of the man who helped build that mansion to every demolition contractor in the county. - So you know. Why didn't you tell me they were planning to tear it down? - It's a tragedy, grace, not one we have any power over. - And it's a reminder that the blue moon ball is not about fancy location. It's about bringing the community together. - So you're gonna host the party in your backyard? - If it came to that, in a heartbeat, and anyone in town would do the same thing. - Yes, ma'am, all true. - Sean's trying to have the mansion deemed as a historical site. - Right. Sean. I was wondering when your two paths would cross. - Do you think there's any chance he'll manage to save it? - Well, Sean's a smart man. The town's lucky to have him. That said, he's not exactly the persuasive type. - That's definitely true. He could never get me to do anything. - Yes, I know that. You were always the ring leader with the bright ideas. You know, I remember the time you and Sean stole that fire hose and flooded out old man Jeremiah's taxidermy shop. Woo hoo hoo hoo! He was hopping mad! - Don't encourage her. - Like two peas in a pod of mischief. - I plead the fifth. Hey, phone? Yes? - What does love mean? An intense feeling of deep affection. Example: His love of football. - Grace Montague speaking. Hey, grace, it's James. - Hey! - You'll never guess where I'm at. Back at the scene of the crime. Look, I know it's a little bit late for brunch, but my work is taking me out of the city tomorrow. So, if you're free tonight, maybe we could squeeze in that date. - I'm actually not in la right now. I'm on a bit of a work trip myself. - Oh, well, yeah, I knew it was a long shot. - Um... Weird question for you. But I was just wondering, how do you know when to stop diagnosing a patient? Like, how do you know when you're done testing them and you can just treat them for what you think it is? - There's no hard and fast rule. When I've exhausted all the possibilities I can think of. Then I just trust my gut. - Does your next romance novel need a doctor? - No, but that actually helped. Thanks, James. Have a good night. - You too. Bye, grace. Hey, phone? Yes? - How to write a persuasive study on historical property value. - Approved historical property applications: 1,021 entries. - Hey, phone, email links to me. Emailing links. - Mom, are you awake? Mom. Are you awake? - What happened? What time is it? 5:00 A.M.! - I've been up all night trying to figure out how to help Sean win a zoning permit, and I think I've done it. - So you're an architect now? - I know! But like sheriff Carson said, Sean doesn't need an architect; He needs a writer. And I'm a writer! I'm persuasive! - And loud. - Yeah. - You know, grace, this is a noble project, but do you think it's a good idea to be working with Sean again? I mean, I remember when you two broke up. It just really hurt you. - It was years ago. We were just kids. We've grown past all that. - Yeah, but what about your work? Don't you have a deadline the night of the ball? Shouldn't you stay focused? - I can do both. See? Did you see? Oh. I didn't know they taught the two-step at architectural school. - Whoever built this place knew exactly what they were doing. This house is built with a sprung floor that absorbs shock. So when I lift you up... And then drop you back down... - I don't break an ankle. - Exactly. I want to tell you something. - Yeah? - I was hired for this job because the contractor knew I'd fail. It's my first job with the firm. I'm a newbie. - How would the contractor possibly know that? - The contractor is Heather's dad. - Ugh! Classic small-town nepotism. - I'm glad you came home. Might be your last chance to say goodbye if I botch this job. - My mom used to tell me stories that my great-great-grandpa helped build that red barn. How could such a precious place not have any historical significance? - That's so weird! No, my family used to tell me the exact same story. - Maybe our ancestors built it together. And maybe that's why we need to work together now. We're not gonna let some rich country bureaucrats take over our town! If you can prove what makes the site historical, I'll come up with the arguing proposal. What do you say? Team? - Team. - So what's first on the list? Library archives or a town-wide save-the-mansion petition? - Actually, I noticed a quarter wall panel that looks a little too new. - So it's been updated. That's good, right? - Yeah, but it only takes up half the wall. - So it's covering something up? - Exactly. - Fingers crossed it's not black mold. - Well, I'm gonna head home and grab some tools. I'm gonna get that paneling off. - Great! I can see your new digs. - Actually, I've had a bit of an infestation. - Mice? - Something like that. I'll drop you off at home and... We can meet up later. - Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. I have some writing to do anyway, so... No way! You're still driving Jess? - Of course! - You put some work into her. Ah, there's no more hole in the passenger seat. - You don't need that old striped pillow anymore. - Oh yeah! I totally forgot about that thing. - Got new mud tires on her too. - Must be the season. Heather was just telling me that she got the same thing for her truck. - Her truck. Great. - Mom? I have a problem. As a kid, you would always say that when you didn't know how to finish a story. - Well, at least with a story, I can always erase it and try again. Those look lovely, by the way. - Thank you. - With this, if I mess up, there's no do-over, no back button. - And exactly what problem is it we're discussing? - Sean. He's acting all weird and aloof. - Well, you know, maybe his life is a little more complicated than you think. - What do you mean? - Well, I'm not one to pry into other people's affairs, but... You know, your history together is complex. - Technically, I guess we never called off our engagement, but that was years ago. - Mm-hm. And now? - Now we're working together... And it just feels like all those years of being best friends never happened. It I'll just makes me feel more... - Interested? - Confused. - Are you still in love with him? - No! I'm in like, emphasis on the like. And I have no idea if he feels the same way. - Do you remember when you started writing? - No. - It was after your father died. You needed to just sort through your feelings, write them out. So the stories and the poems were fiction. But your emotions were real. - So you think I should journal? - I think it would give you the clarity you need. - Thanks, mom. You always have the best advice. - Hey Sean! You still want to see a movie tonight? - Yeah, yeah. Just one sec. - What's with all the letters? - I just... Nothing. Just junk mail. Makes good fire starter. What movie are we seeing again tonight? - Okay. What do I want to say about Sean? It depends on what he has to say about me. Hello? - Hey! Are you busy? - If you consider staring at a blank computer screen busy, then yes. - Sounds rough. - Yeah. I need a break. - Good. You're never gonna believe this. - What is it? What is all this? - It looks like an old doorway that someone filled in, and some vandalism. - I don't think it's vandalism. An old tradition, maybe. - Names and hearts. Past lovers? - Okay, what were your grandparents' names? - Albert and Marjorie. Why? - Do you think this was them? - There's only one way to find out. - They're still alive? - Grandpa Albert is. Present's a little tricky, but the past he knows like the back of his hand. - You up for a trip down memory Lane? - On one condition. - Anything from my partner in crime. - I get to drive Jess. - I really appreciate you doing this, grace, especially when you have work of your own you've got to get back to. - I wouldn't exactly consider this work. - Lucky! I barely slept with all the thoughts racing through my mind. - I mean, there's really only two ways we can go, right? - You're right. We save her or we don't. Hey, I'm really doing everything I can to save the mansion. I know I screwed up and disappointed you in the past, but I'll try not to let that happen again. - Disappointed me? Sean, I sent you about 101 text messages, countless embarrassing late-night voicemails, and you couldn't so much as call me back? - But... You never came back! - I was chasing my dreams to be a writer! You said you wanted that for me. - And I did! - So I don't get it. You're not making sense. - I really screwed up, didn't I? - You did. Do you think it's too late to fix it? - Fix it? - I still have the bolt, Sean. - Get down! - What? - Your hair! There's a bug in it! Let me get it! There's a- ew! Ew, ew, ew! Get it out, get it out! Did you get it? Sean! - Got it. - Let me see it! - I smashed it. Wait here. I'm gonna get grandpa. - Yeah. You go get grandpa. - Hi, Mrs. Montague! - Oh, well, Heather! Hello! Did you jog all the way here? - Exercise keeps me focused. - I love the determination. What brings you out to the area? - Well, it's a town-wide survey, I want to know exactly what kind of stores this town wants to see in the new mall. A new tech shop, a trendy cafe, arts boutiques, you name it. - I'm very sorry, Heather. I just don't think it's right I take the survey. Grace and I are dead set against the mansion demolition. Well, that's all right. You have a great day, Mrs. Montague. - You too. - Mrs. Montague? - Yes, dear? - Grace is really lucky to have such a supportive mom. How are you feeling? How they treating you in there? - Well, I can't complain, you know. I mean, I started out with nothing, and I still have most of it left. You're doing great. I mean, look at you. - Well, you know. - Grandpa Albert, this is the friend I was telling you about, grace. Who? Speak up. - Grace! - Eh? - Oh! Marjorie, my dear! Let's go to the races! - Grandpa Albert, that's not Marjorie. She's- - at the riding club. - Oh, at the riding club? Well, of course she is. I'm sorry, dear. My mistake. - I guess the green family loving me must be a genetic trait. - Taxi driver... Take me to the mansion gardens! I haven't seen a blooming lilac in years. - Yes, sir. Oh, what a time to be alive. - Grandpa? - Eh? - I wanted to ask you about the blue moon ball. Do you remember it? - Well, of course I remember it! Dancing under the blue moon is how every man in this town found the love of his life, glowing under Luna's soft kiss. - That's beautiful. Is that how you met Marjorie? - Oh, no, no, we grew up together. We were in the same class all the way from kindergarten through graduation. - Just like us. - Albert, we were wondering about the mansion. We found some carved initials, and we were just wondering if they had any sort of significance. - Significance? It's a tradition! As old as the blue moon itself. Legend had it that if a young man would carve his name next to the name of the woman he loved, they would be brought together again under the next blue moon, and the moon would see to it, no matter what the circumstances, that their paths would cross and their love blossom. - Does it work? - Ask Marjorie. We've been married since 1960. Why are you asking all these questions about the blue moon ball anyway? - Grandpa Albert... There are some people who want to tear the mansion down. Me and grace, we're trying to gather as much information as we can to stop that from happening. - That's criminal! - Grandpa! Where are you going? - The study! - There's a study? - Not that I know of. Grandpa, where are you going? - You'll see. Prepare to be amazed. Nice work, Sean. - That's a boy. Ah, here we go. Whoa-ho, here it is. - Is this an original map of our town? Uh-huh. - It can't be. The year's 1831. We weren't found until 1845. - That's right. The original founder of this land, Austin Hastings, bought over 10,000 acres and built this mansion for his wife. They knew they had something special here, so they started giving land deeds to some of the struggling local farmers to foster a community. He envisioned a town, and this is what it became. - Enough to have to have it declared a historic site? - I mean, if we can find the original deeds, I don't see why not. Find 'em? My grandpa used to bring me here to the mansion when I was a child for history lessons. Now, Mr. Hastings kept every document he ever had right here in this desk. There you go. - Look, we're all here. The Montagues, the Greens. - As a gesture of appreciation, the local farmers built Mr. Hastings the red barn. - Grace, I... I wanna ask you something. - Yeah? - It's kinda awkward. I'm more just asking for a friend. Oh, well, yeah, let's hear it. - He has this girlfriend... And she was supposed to be just a rebound to help him get over the biggest heartbreak of his life. But that rebound turned out to be more permanent than he expected. And he's been trying to break up with her for months now, but he doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. - Us girls are tougher than we look. You should just be honest with her. No one likes getting strung along. Do I know this couple? - Yeah. It's Heather actually. - Ugh. I pity the man who's ever crossed paths with her. - Me too. Pot hole! - I don't know about you, but I'd sooner take a pothole over a ticket. - It's Jess we're talking about. - You've got me there. Just let me do the talking. It's fine. - Sorry, officer. I was just avoiding a pothole. - Mm-hm. Well, grace, I know these country roads aren't as pristine as la. That with some pretty erratic driving, even for the likes of this town, not to mention you're in the company of one of the most notorious party boys in these parts. - Sean? - Me? - No, I'm talking about Albert. Best square dance caller I know. So, to ensure that we keep the streets safe, I'm gonna need you to prove that you haven't been drinking. Hop on out of the car, miss Montague. You, too, partner. - What can I do for you, sheriff? Want me to walk the line? - Not quite, grace. I've found line dance is a much better judge of sobriety. - You're kidding! I don't even remember how to line dance! - Maybe your good friend Sean here can remind you. Come on. Hop to it. - It was the line dance king in the day. - Cowboy up! Come on! Oh! I haven't done this since the last ball. I can't believe my feet even know what to do. - It's not your feet. It's your heart. - Sweetie? Are you awake? I know you've been up for hours writing, but I made cookies. - Oatmeal raisin! My favorite! - I thought you were in your room. Did you sneak out? - Sneak out? I hate to burst your bubble, mom, but I'm not 16 anymore. - No, six is a better estimate. - Come on. I want to tell you about my ideas for the mansion that required your wisdom and expertise. - Oh. - Sean says the biggest problem with the mansion is keeping it heated and maintained while it's not being used. - Which is 99% of the time. And if we had a ball there every night, well, then we'd lose the very rarity that makes it so special. - The town's been helping the Cassidys with the costs for a long time, but it's a big number. Maybe it doesn't have to be a ball. What about a farmers market? - Or a wedding venue. It's so beautiful. - Why not both? - Well, people have been asking for an indoor farmers market for years. We could use the barn. - And the house and the grounds are magazine worthy. We'd just need a marketing campaign to get the word out. - Oh! They're perfect. But who'd run it. - I happen to know a certain empty nester who's been needing a new baby. - Am I so obvious? - Look, a shooting star! - I wish that you and Sean save the mansion. - I wish the universe would give me a sign. If Sean's the one I meant to be with, have him call me right now. - You're not gonna get that? - It's a telemarketer. - Just because you don't get a sign doesn't mean it's not gonna work out. - Hey, hon. I saw your track of the old Fogeys home today. Visiting grandpa? Sean? Hello? - Daddy, we have a problem. Heather, what now? - He's finding evidence. Good evidence. I think maybe someone's helping him. Heather, do you want to be appointed executive developer of this mall or not? - Wh- yes! I want him with anything in this world. Then start making some executive decisions. You know this man, you know how to shake him up. Change his mind! Am I making myself clear? - Crystal. Morning! - Good morning. - Dressing up for someone? Please tell me that manicure is for your keyboard. - There's point in trying to figure out the ending to my novel without first finding out how my love story ends. - I think it's great that you want to reflect your life experiences in your writing, but don't forget that relationships take work. - Writing takes work. Relationships only take one thing: Love. Fate brings people together, and if it's meant to be, it should be easy. - I don't know if your father would have agreed with that. - Well, let's see if Sean does. - Okay. Time to rip off the band-aid. Miss pick here and let me just cut to the chase, I can't won't call you back if you don't leave your name and number, so do it! - Hi, miss pick. I mean Heather. It's Sean. My number is 555... Listen, we need to talk. Today. I feel like things have been a little off recently, and if you could just give me a shout when you have a chance. Bye. ♪ So if she runs away ♪ well then I better chase after her ♪ ♪ I'm never pushing anything ♪ she's trying to pull me back for more ♪ ♪ caught up in the moment ♪ I'm just keeping my cool ♪ I'm a sucker for love girl ♪ yeah you know I'm your fool I heard the siren's call. - Whatever do you mean? - Please. I'd recognize our song three miles away. - What took you so long? - There was something I needed to take care of first. So I could give you my full attention. - And did you manage to take care of it? - Not quite. But I'm resolute. What's this? - This is the finished proposal and an idea for a farmers market and a wedding venue overseen by my sweet mother. - You are my savior! ♪ Bad times anything in between ♪ ♪ the ups and downs and baby you're still my queen ♪ - Sean... There's something I've been meaning to tell you. - You can tell me anything. ♪ The plan was to grow old together ♪ - I don't want to be friends. ♪ If she runs away well then I better chase after her ♪ - What do you want to be? - This. Help me! I've been maimed! - What happened? - Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay! I'm seriously wounded! I'm just lucky it was my leg and not my neck! - You fell? - Yeah. I got your voicemail, and I was hurrying into the mansion when this happened. Step broke right through! Just imagine the lawsuit if it weren't someone as spry as myself. This whole place is a death trap. The whole structure's just rotting away. - I don't know about the whole structure. It was just one step. - Give me your keys. I'll get the truck, and we can take her to the hospital and make sure nothing's broken. - Oh! Oh, I can't put any weight on it! I can't put any weight on it. If it's not broken, it's definitely fractured. I'm so lucky to have you. I'm probably gonna be out of commission for the rest of the summer. I'm gonna need you. Help me get dressed, drive me to the stables... Feed me. - Are your arms broken too? - I was just saying how lucky it is and fortunate that I have someone who loves me, someone who would choose me over some old building. So what was your voicemail about? - Nothing. Don't worry about it. Okay, do you want... - Do you need help? We should get something to stabilize her leg. - Oh, don't worry about it, grace. My seanie will stabilize it while you drive. - My seanie? - Maybe she hit her head too. We'd better get going! I'll be right back with a wheelchair. Don't talk to each other! What? - He really is sweet, isn't he? - He really is. This town's lucky to have him. - Good cheekbones. - Contagious laugh. - You really did capture him in your novels, you know? All his happy-go-lucky mannerisms. - I'm so glad you could tell. It was really hard to capture his character, his... Essence. - I don't know how you do it. - Do what? - You know. Recall those feelings every time you sit down to write. It sounds exhausting. - Everyone doing okay in here? Sean! - I was in a rush, I'm sorry! - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Watch your leg, watch your leg, watch you leg. Okay, sit, sit. - Ow! - Ooh! I'm so sorry. - Grace. - James! What are you doing here? - I applied for the locum position here. They offered me the job. I don't know if I should take it. After looking around, this town just seems so... Quiet. You don't live here, do you? - No, no, I... I mean, I did. I'm just visiting. - Grace was born and raised here. She's ours. - I mean, she knows how to appreciate the quiet. How do you guys know each other? - I sense tension. Is this an la boyfriend you've been keeping from us? - James bought one of my books. - It's hard to resist a given saleswoman. - I know we could all stay here gushing over grace's books all day, but I need to see a doctor, Sean. - Right. Grace, you coming? - I'll just wait in the truck. - It's the locks. It'll be a bit of a wait for them, and I'm just getting off work. If you don't mind, I'll drop you anywhere you need to go. - Okay. Sure. Wonderful. I'll be back in five. - Sounds good. Hi, mom. - Oh, not so fast young lady! - I need to get inside and write. I know how my novel ends. - So what does that mean? Sean's the only one for me. No one, no matter how dreamy, can take his place. We're soulmates. - That's amazing, sweetie. I'm glad you're proving me wrong. Not to mention he's driving quite the car now. - Oh, that was actually a friend from la. - Your two worlds colliding? - More like a surprise meteor. - Isn't that what wiped out the dinosaurs? - Go finish your book while you're glowing with inspiration. - Thank you. - I just swear it was the other leg you were clutching. It's weird that the one that hurt less... Was the one that was fractured. - Yeah, well, you're an architect, not a physician. Let's just stay in your field. - Can I get you anything? Water? Tea? - How about the permit to that old house's demolition? As long as it's still standing, people are in danger. - I know you were planning on being a lead investor and developer in the outlet mall. - This has nothing to do with that. - Are you sure? - How'd you know? - You leave your sticky notes everywhere. It wasn't that hard to piece together. - That house is gonna come down, Sean. It's just a matter of time. And the land is better off in the hands of a local than some outside builder. - Have you ever considered there might be a better use for your money, something that makes it more positive change? - I am not paying for you to go on another six-month archeological dig. - It was a six-day architectural convention, and I paid you back. - Old buildings, old bones, all the same to me. Now I'll take that tea, please. - That everything? - For now. Store everything near the kitchen. The decorating crew will be in tonight. - I can't believe that ball's tomorrow. This week flew by. - Life does that. And the older you get, the faster it goes. - Call you in a bit. - No mansion means no dancin'! No mansion means no dancin'! No mansion means no dancin'! - Grandpa Albert? What are you doing here so early? You must be freezing. - I'm hot with a raging fire! Sweating for justice! - Does the nursing home know you're here? - Do those people know anything? The newspaper said that a step came loose and some local lady got injured. They said the mansion was a hazard. - That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be demolished. We get the final word this afternoon. - Those bureau-rats should know the facts! - Sean, I need you to get to the mansion now! - What facts, grandpa Albert, are we talking about? - I proposed to Marjorie on those steps. They're as sturdy as our marriage. What we're dealing with here is first degree sabotage. - Joe, come here! Hey, Joe! - Wait here. - Hey! What are you doing? - Marking the placements. For the explosives? They need to be aligned with the support beam to ensure the entire building comes down in one go. - You can't implode the mansion! No final decision's been announced! - We're just doing some preliminary work, okay? We won't do anything actually until the results are in. - So stop digging holes! - If I don't dig holes, the wrecking ball guy may take my job. We're all fighting for something here, sweetie. No mansion means no dancin'! - You hit a gas line? No dancin' - Albert! - No ma- Marjorie! Oh, I'm so glad you came back. This is what happens when problems get swept under the rug. Couples fight. - Grace? - Sean! - Grandpa Albert? - Come again? - This isn't what it looks like. - I was professing my love. - All right, it's exactly what it looks like. - Come on, grandpa. We need to get you back to the home. This will be your 10th demerit. - Can I have one last look inside the mansion? - Those contractors are already planning her implosion. That's how certain they are that we already failed. - We put up the best fight we could for the people of this community, living and passed. That's what the blue moon's all about. - Speaking of... You haven't officially asked me to the ball yet. - I think I asked you last time. Doesn't that make it your turn. - Sean green... Will you go to the ball with me? - I'll see if I can fit in my schedule. - Great. I'll come by yours tomorrow and pick you up. - Um... Maybe I should pick you up. Sean? Sean green? Hi, Oscar. - Hey, good luck. My daughter, she's been looking forward to this ball for five years straight. It'll be her first one. - Let's hope. Steps seem fine. - Well, what are you waiting for? Open it. - What if we didn't get it? I'd be chased out of town! - Sean, no one would blame you. We did everything we could. - You open it. If we got the permit, it's all because of you're amazing proposal. Well? - I'm sorry, Sean. Sorry that you ever doubted yourself! We got the permit, and the town's gonna buy out the Cassidys. We did it! - Yes! - I guess the blue moon had our back. - This wasn't the blue moon, grace. This was all you! - We make a great team. I'm gonna let grandpa know! - Okay. I'm gonna let the newspaper know that the ball is full steam ahead, and I'll be at your place at six. - Six? Tonight? I like sweet Shiraz and chardonnay. - Heather... I want to break up. We don't love each other. I don't even think you like me. Is there another woman? Well, if we're being honest... Heather, put down the dinner plates! No, no. Can't we talk about this like civilized adults? Get out of my house! This is my house! Heather? You home? I'm in here! - We need to talk. - Are those the permit results for the mansion? - The results have nothing to do with what I'm about to say. - Unless you're about to say the results, which I'd really like to know. - Heather, I want to break up. We don't love each other. If anything- - okay. - Okay? - Yeah, fine. Let's break up. - Just like that? - I'm gonna need some alone time to grieve. Mind leaving? - Actually, this is my house. - Both my leg and my heart have been broken in the past 24 hours, and you have the gall- - okay. Sorry, you're right. Take all the time you need. Sorry. I thought your leg was broken. - Ow, ow, ow! - It's the other one. - I'd loved to have seen Heather's face when she heard the news. - I don't know what you have against that girl. She spent her whole life wanting to be just like you. - Very funny. I'm the last person that Heather would ever want to be. I'm proud of our family, but compared to her, I grew up with nothing. - That may be true, but just to imagine how she sees things. You grew up earning everything that she got for free. And you're the one with the career and passion. She may have money, but her dreams haven't come to fruition. If she even knows what her dreams are. - I never thought of it that way. Do you think- Hold that thought. - Hello? - Grace, finally! Either you're in some backwards hole in the wall with no WiFi, or you have developed a tendency to hang up on me. - I would never. Did you get a chance to read my novel? What did you think? - I think we should discuss this in my office. Can you come in tomorrow morning? - Tomorrow? Is it urgent? - It certainly shouldn't be postponed. Is that a problem. - No, no. No problem at all. I'll book a flight back to la tonight. - Great. Okay, kiddo, I'll see you soon. - See ya. Sean. - I've faked a lot of things these past few months, but... I never faked how badly I wanted this. It would have been a chance to make something of myself. - You're a pick. You're the top of the town. You never had to prove yourself. - Maybe not to you, but to myself and to my family? I can't just live off daddy's charity forever. Anyway, that's enough that rich girl's sob story for today. Thank you for not freaking out. - How could I be mad? - I've made my fair share of mistakes in this relationship too. It's open. - What's going on? - Oh, you know. Just realizing I’m living in a fantasy. Truth is so much crueler than fiction. - I don't think that's how the saying goes. Are you leaving? - My publisher told me to come back to la 'cause my novel was a total flop. - He said that? - He didn't have to. - But the blue moon ball is tomorrow night. - Trust me, I know. - I'm just scared that you're going back with more mixed emotions about this place than when you came here. - I'm focused on my career, not my emotions. - You are gonna have the most amazing writing career, grace! I just worry you're gonna have regrets in other aspects of your life. - Like my non-existent love life? I don't think so. Here. I don't need any more reminders of him!

No demolition! - No demolition. Just some much-needed repairs. - Have a safe flight, and remember to call and let me know what they say. And remember, grace, you always have a home here. - I'll call you when I get back to la, okay? - I love you, grace. Stay safe. - I love you too, mom. - I saw a car! Was she in it? - You just missed her. - She's leaving? Because of me? - You've gone ahead and broken Gracie's heart again. I'd be shocked if she ever wants to come back home. - I broke up with Heather. - A few minutes too late, it seems. - Grace kept the pillow? - She's always clung onto a piece of your, Sean. I'm sure she'd love to have all of you for once. - I can't believe I lost my chance with her. - Love has nothing to do with chances, Sean. Aw, Sean, you have a good night. - My Cinderella. - Oh, Sean, I feel badly for you, but I don't think my daughter would appreciate me comforting you on the night of her breakup. - What if this doesn't have to be the night of her breakup? What if this could be the first day of her Cinderella story? I have the best idea. I know this will. Please, I know this will work. - Grace, it's my job to be honest with you, so that's what I'm gonna be. A good romance novel, heck, a good relationship has lovers that beat the odds, characters who confront their biggest fears and come out on the other side stronger. Lyndon and Savannah's problems disappearing under the blue moon is... It's ex machina. - Do you think it's possible that maybe you're interpreting it wrong? What you're reading as ex machina is meant to be read as fate. True love conquers all. - What exactly did they conquer? - The distance that held them apart. - Yes, right, so they move closer and they're no longer physically distant. What about the emotional distance? What about Lyndon never replying to her letters? What about Savannah's fear of commitment? - I can add those pages in. Consider it an epilogue. - I'm gonna think of it as a total bust. - What's this? - Your severance check. Good luck, grace. - But it's a trilogy. What about the third book? - Grace, you know, sometimes an open ending is more satisfactory than the wrong ending. - Um... Right. Yeah. - You know, one day you may wake up to that happy ending, but until then, maybe you should stick with user manuals and technical writing. - Um... Fyi, Danny... Happy endings don't exist. - I think my ex-wife would agree with you on that one. - I've only spent one day in pediatrics, but I am certain that's where I'm supposed to be. Now, there's something about working with children that makes me feel like I'm making a difference in the world. - That sounds so amazing. - I'm sorry. I've been going on and on about myself. What's it like being a writer? It's... Challenging. Sometimes I wish I could just... Disappear into my books. Can you tell that from my writing? - I haven't actually had a chance to read your book yet. - That's okay. It's probably for the best. - Wait, wait, wait. Hey, did I say something wrong? - No, it's not that. You're perfect, James. You're the kind of guy I write books about. - But that's fiction. - Exactly.

Every day I stay away is a day you can make your dreams come true. You're going be the most amazing writer. You've already written the best love story across my heart. Love you always, Sean. - Sean green, I know you can hear me! Guess what? You're too late! 53 letters too late! - This dress will look better on you than me? - My turn. Grace, I know you're a girl of fairytales and Cinderella stories, but maybe our romance isn't that simple. Maybe our love has to break convention for it to be real outside of your books. - What are you doing here? - Winning you back. Here. Ask me anything. - Okay. Why are you wearing a dress? - To make you laugh and maybe let me in. Next. - Why didn't you tell me that you were dating Heather? - I tried, but... Things are never that simple. I was hoping you wouldn't have to find out. - So there could be another secret between us? Like all those letters you never sent? - I never sent the letters, because I was scared that if I admitted that I loved you, you'd come back to our small town and leave your dreams behind. I was scared that I would distract you from becoming who you were meant to be. - You were never a distraction, Sean. You were my muse. Don't you get that? - I was scared I... Wouldn't ever be good enough for you, grace. - Sean, you've always been everything I ever wanted... And exactly what I needed. - I've loved you from the moment I saw you. And that's never changed. Please forgive me, grace. Is it too late? - The truth is I could have come home anytime to see you. I was scared too. I guess being disappointed was easier than taking a risk to get hurt. And in my imagination, love was always perfect. But that's not real life. - Can we fix it? - It'll never be too late for us. Too bad it's too late for the ball. - Then I guess it's a good thing I already booked two flights back home. - Wow! You were really confident you were gonna get me back. - I took a chance and believed for a change. Come on! Let's catch that plane. - Wait. - What's wrong? - Do you mind if I wear the dress? - I'll have to later about it. - This place is amazing, even more spectacular than I remember. - I have something to show you. - I love it! We're leaving our Mark. In the words of grandpa Albert, if lovers carve their names on the walls of the mansion, the blue moon will see to it that they are reunited. - I think I lost another bet. But you kids were right. Fate works in mysterious and wonderful ways. - It wasn't fate. It was respect and communication. - Honesty and forgiveness. Were finally both all in. - And ready. - Well, then I can guarantee it's a relationship that's gonna last, one worth lasting. - May I have this dance? - I'd be delighted. - I think he was talking to me. - If you think so. - I heard there was a young woman in need of a dance partner. Now, I've only got 15 minutes before bed check at the home, so hate to make this a dance to remember! - Okay! - Sean, there's something I need to tell you. - Please don't say you want me in that dress again. - Despite how cute you looked, no. I... I lost my publishing contract. My agents hated my latest novel. - Grace, I'm so sorry. - Me too. - Can you try again at a new version now that your muse is back? - I could write the best novel in the world and I don't think he'd give me a second chance. - Well, I might know someone with a large sum of money who's looking to invest. It's a bit of a long shot, but who knows? The timing might be just right. - Really? You think they've read my novels? - Read them? They're your biggest fan. And they're here tonight. Do you want me to introduce you? - Sean, that's amazing! I love you. - Say it again. - I love you. - Again. - I love you. - I love you too, grace. I'll get you a real engagement ring, but until then... Will you marry me? - You couldn't stop me if you tried. Now you have lipstick all over you. - Who's that scary investor? - Grace, this is Heather. Heather, grace. - Sean? - Sure, you've gone to school together. Maybe you've even been friends at one point. But you've never been business partners. - What are you talking about? - You've wanted to make a name for yourself ever since your dad got you tour first set of business cards in the sixth grade. - You have money and business sense but... Not a stitch of creativity. And grace, you're all passion and creativity, but completely lacking in practical, commercial skills. - Sean, what are you babbling about? - I think what he's trying to say is... I could really use your help. I'm looking for someone to invest in the publication of my third novel. - You want that person to be me? - I would love that. He's right. We'd make a good team. - A toast! - There you are. My beautiful fiancee. Everything all right? - Sean. I love you. And I love this town. But... I don't think I can live here anymore. - What? - My career and my life are in la now. - You just lost your contract. - I know. You're right. We can make this work. If you want to stay here or come with me... We can make it work this time. - Grace, this is crazy deja vu. I can't believe you're saying this. - I know, and I'm sorry. But I've been out here trying to figure it out and... I know that if I stay here, I won't be happy... And that's gonna hurt us. Maybe not immediately, but in time. Please just come with me. - I have an old house I’m renovating that I love. And I have a job here. This is where we're supposed to be. I can't believe I'm hearing this. - Sean- - no, I need to think. - I am such a huge fan of yours! I can't believe that I'm finally meeting you! - That is so sweet. There you go. Ester! - I think it's about time I get a signed copy of my own. - Of course. - If I had known, I would have had one ready for you. - Oh, that's all right. I was hoping to meet your new Beau. - He's not here. - I am so sorry! - Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry I'm late. - So this is the man worth 90,000 words. I think I'd like your signature too. - I love you. - I love you too. ♪ Hey. ♪ On a path to destruction ♪ couldn't care if I live or die ♪ ♪ I drown the pain that I've created ♪ ♪ make amends lord knows that I've tried ♪ ♪ 'cause I'm gone ♪ I'm so gone ♪ been wandering around but I'm never lost ♪ ♪ oh I'm gone ♪ I'm so gone ♪ I've stumbled on the line that I shouldn't cross ♪ ♪ hey ♪ oh oh oh oh ♪ I've been riding all alone ♪ just a victim who lost everything ♪ ♪ it's hard to carry on ♪ I black out to ease the pain ♪ with no one there to comfort me ♪ ♪ and tell me it's okay ♪ just tell me it's okay ♪ I heard you call me a train wreck ♪ ♪ informing me like I didn't know ♪ ♪ try to tell me what I should do ♪ ♪ and I can tell you where you should go ♪ ♪ 'cause I'm gone ♪ I'm so gone
