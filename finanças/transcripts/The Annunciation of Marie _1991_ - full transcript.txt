THE TIDINGS BROUGHT TO MARIE Based on the play by Paul Claudel. Halt. Is this how you leave the house, without bidding its ladies farewell? Move out of the way. You didn't even manage to kill me with your bad knife. Who has loved and not desired possessing all that he loved? Insulted men, like women, are haunted by demons. Stand by the light. I want to look at you. Have you looked long enough? Who are you, young lady, and what part of you was reserved by God, so that the skin of the lusty hand that touches you becomes shriveled, as if it was touched by His mystery? What happened to you? The day after that day that you know about, I recognized the awful evil on my skin. What evil? Leprosy. Aren't you horrified by the leper? God is here. He will protect me. Peace upon you, Pierre. Violaine, I will not go back to you. 'You call me rose, ' said the rose, but if you knew my name, I'd wither and die. What Justice are you building in Rheims, that will rival Notre Dame in beauty? It is the church that the Rheims guild commissioned me to build. Who will take care of you there? I have always lived like a laborer. A clump of hay and two rocks will suffice. And a little daily bread. - What is this ring, Violaine? - Jacques gave me this ring. Is this all you will give me for Justice? Is that not enough in exchange for a small stone? But Justice is a large stone. I am not made of the same quarry. Young girl, I can tell a good stone when I see one, as well as good men, and women. But not young girls, mister Pierre. That's too delicate for you. Do you love him? There is a big mystery between us. How beautiful the world is, and how happy I am. How beautiful the world is, and how miserable I am. You city man, can you hear this little soul singing? It's a lark. Forgive me, for I am too happy, and the one I love loves me, and we are at peace. Rise to heaven in one leap, while I have to raise a whole cathedral from naught before I am granted entrance. Tell me that you forgive Jacques for marrying me. I do not forgive him. It is hard to be a leper. You caused this with your beauty, and your poisonous smile. The poison was not in me. I know. It was in me. My diseased flesh has not cured my ailing soul. Image of eternal beauty, you are not mine. I am not an image. Be a man, Pierre, be worthy of the fire that consumes you. Poor Pierre. That church alone will be my bride, sprung from my rib, like a stone Eve, in the slumber of my pain. Violaine, my soul, I will not see you again. Who knows? I'll take your ring, and who knows if I am not also taking Violaine's soul, my child, to mold it into a church? Be with God, Pierre. Be with God, Violaine. Poor Pierre. The toad, under the sheaf, speaks crystal words. Why are you looking at me? - Say what is on your mind. - It is hard to speak to you. I need to mend your button. Our little girls have grown up. Grown up? No. - Who will we marry them to? - Marry? The hypocrisy of women. They always conceal their thoughts by saying their contrary. I will speak no more. Jacques Hury. Well? I will give him Violaine, and he will be the son I never had. It is I who taught him everything. Beasts, grain, arms, tools, customs, God, how one must think before speaking. I have seen him grow as he watched me. I'm afraid. Well? Mara slept in my room this winter while you were ill. - And? - We often spoke at night. And? Are you sure he loves her? What if Mara wants to marry Jacques? She is hard as steel. Jacques will marry Violaine. He will marry her then. I have something else to tell you, old woman. I'm leaving. Leaving? Where to? - There. - To Chateau? - Farther away. - To Bourges? To the other king? To the king of kings, to Jerusalem. Lord. Is France no longer good enough for you? There is too much pain in France. But we are happy here. Precisely. We are too happy, and others are not. Anne, that is not our fault. - It is not theirs either. - I don't know. You're here and I have 2 children. You must realize that everything is chaos, and everyone's seeking order. I am tired of being happy. Vice in this world is caused by everyone wanting to enjoy his possessions, as if they were theirs alone. That smoke we often see in the distance is not caused by mere hay. Who calls you away? An angel playing the trumpet. What trumpet? The soundless trumpet that everyone hears. The trumpet that sometimes calls men to share their riches. You will always be young and beautiful. My love for dark-haired Elisabeth is great. My hair is gray. - Say yes, Elisabeth. - Yes, Anne. Clothed patience, I will soon be back, - And soon we will separate again. - Today? - Leaving today? - Today. And now, I will get Jacques. If she marries him, I will kill myself. Mara. I will hang myself where we found the cat hanging. You wicked girl. Jacques Hury loves her. I know you don't love me. She pretends she is a saint, but, I, Mara, speak the truth, and that is what upsets people. Wicked. As a child, you never cried when you were beaten. Tell him I'll kill myself. And he? What if he does not want to marry you? I am certain he does not want to. - Well? - Well. - What say you? - A pilgrimage to Jerusalem. - You shall be the father now. - I don't understand. I am leaving. The sun is our glistening ox, and the rain is our creditor. Others await riches from other men, while we receive them from the heavens. Earth longs for the sky, as the body longs for the soul. Here is my anointed son. Jacques Hury. I am leaving. Obey him. Marie, do not take your father's love in vain. Jacques, take her as your wife. Love her every day of your life, like the bread one never tires of. But does she want me? Who knows? Do you want me, Violaine? My father has spoken. But do you want me? I do. How will we get on together? Think about it while there's still time. I take you here by the hand, and by the arm, and all that is attached to it. Parents, you daughter is no longer yours. She is mine. What say you, mother? I am happy. The oriole sings. What does it say? That last night's rain was like gold for the earth. What else does the little bird say? That the weather is good, that God is great, that it is two hours before noon. Bring me my shoes. Bring me my coat. What? You're leaving? He has heard nothing I've said. Put on my shoes. Goodbye, Elisabeth. Bring me my horse. Let us share our bread one last time. - You will never see me again. - Goodbye, Elisabeth. Goodbye, Mara. Be good. Goodbye, father. Goodbye to you all. What is it, child? You exchanged a father for a husband. Alas, father, alas. - Good morning, Mara. - My lord. I believe you invented that tale you told me. What tale? - The mason's tale. - Are you talking about Violaine? That girl makes me blush. It is shameful to give oneself, the outside, the inside, and the root. - I know her whole being is mine. - Yes. How well you speak, how certain you are of your possessions. Brainard of Braine, one only owns what one has made, took or won. - Jacques, you are a good young man. - Do not torment me. - Still, it is a shame. - What is a shame? He thinks that all is his, like a peasant on his small plot of land. You will see it is otherwise. My betrothed through the blooming branches, I welcome you. Jacques, good morning. What is this wonderful dress? I put it on for you. It belongs to the nuns of Monsanvierge. We are allowed to don it twice. First, on our wedding day. Second, on the day we die. The world is beautiful, for it granted you to me. Hello, my wife. Hello, tender Violaine. You should never cease being here. I need nothing more than this moment. What a secluded place this is, and how secretly close we are to each other. You heart suffices. I am with you. Tomorrow, in front of everyone, I will embrace this queen. Take her, and never let her go. - Tell me I'm beautiful. - Yes, Violaine. Show me your left hand. My ring is missing. I am more than a ring. After all, I do no harm by loving you. It is God's will, and my father's. - Who will take you away from me? - Do not touch me. Am I a leper? You must know the risk you take by marrying me. No man is strong enough to be a witness to our alliance. It is not the sun of July that shines upon us, but the light of His countenance. Violaine. I am not a scholar, nor a priest, nor a saint. I have a duty, and I'll fulfill it. Don't ask me to comprehend what's beyond me. I can only grasp earthly matters. Wheat does not grow alone. It needs a good farmer to tend to it. To each his own place. That is justice. But I do not love you because it is just, and even if it were not just, I would still love you, perhaps even more. I don't understand. You love me so much, and I can only harm you. There can be no justice between us. I don't understand. My beloved, do not force me to reveal my secret. What secret, Violaine? A secret so great that you will no longer take me as wife. I don't understand. Is my soul not enough? Take it. I am still here, imbibe my soul. Our beings will mix, and neither death nor love will separate us. What more do you ask of me? Why do you want to take what is God's alone? God's hand is on me. You cannot defend me. We will not be husband and wife in this world. What strange words, so tender, so bitter. I believe that you are deceiving me, and playing with me. Yet, I am scared. I see you in this frightening dress. It is not a woman's dress. It is the garb of one offering sacrifices at an altar. Do not look at me with this otherworldly face. Gentle bird, the sky is beautiful, but it is also beautiful to be taken. The sky is beautiful, but it is also a beautiful thing, and worthy of God, the heart of a man, filled to the brim. Do not damn me by concealing your face from me. I am just a man, deprived of beauty and light, but I love you, my angel, my queen, my dear. I can no longer keep my secret from you. A communion as profound as life, neither hell nor heaven can break. Tell me you love me one more time. I love you. Give me your knife. Hand me the knife. What is this silvered flower covering your skin? Leprosy. You are hard to convince. Which leprosy is more hideous, - the soul's, or the body's? - I only know of the body's. Don't you know the other? Do you no longer want to marry me? Daughter of the devil. What has become of your great love? This is the flower I have chosen. Get away from me. I am far enough. You have nothing to fear. You got too close to someone's rotting flesh. Do you speak of Pierre de Craon? Yes, I do. You kissed him on the mouth. It is true. You do not deny that that man possessed you? I deny nothing. Nonetheless, I still love you. Say something. Whatever you have to say, I'll believe it. Speak. I beg you. Tell me it is not true. Mara always speaks the truth. What will you do? I'll take off this dress, leave my home and follow the law. And? I'll go to the place reserved for my kind, the Geyn leper colony. Go undress, and put on clothes for your voyage. May I soon see my work rising from the earth, and touch the indestructible edifice I created with my hands, its different parts standing together in harmony, my work, inhabited by God. Go, and pray for us. What has become of the old man? Where is he now? There. The king can now come. Our work is done. The peace talks are taking place on mountains of ash and fire. All is perturbed and out of its place. Everyone's looking for order. - You have done your work well. - Listen. It is not him. We will hear the bells when he comes. He supped at Fisme. It is on Christmas day that our king Charles comes back to be crowned. A simple daughter of God leads him back to his home. - Jeanne, they call her. The maid. - Christmas, that... Christmas, new milk, so cool. Look out for a short man all dressed in red next to the king. That would be her. On a big black horse. Six months ago, she was milking her father's cows. And now, she holds a banner where Christ's name is written. The English flee before her like mice. What are they doing down there? They will ring the two bells of the cathedral, Baudon and Baude, at midnight, and they will keep ringing until the French arrive. My name is Agnes. I am youth. Why didn't you stay there? Master Pierre sent me to fetch sand. Is that what he is busying himself with? He says his job is not to make roads for kings, but homes for God. What good is Rheims for if the king can't reach it? What good is a road for, if it does not lead to a church? He is not a good Frenchman. Whoever talks politics with us, we blacken his nose with a frying-pan. - They say he's a leper. - It's not true. His skin is as healthy as a child's. No matter. - His body is ill, but his mind is sane. - He better not hear you say that. I remember how he punished a worker who was drawing in a corner. He made him work on the scaffolding all day. He said that he'll learn two things by the end of the day, by rule and by design: How much weight a man can carry, and how tall he is. That is how he taught us that, inside God's house, each man is a secret foundation. He taught us to build with our thumb, and hand, and elbow, and strength, and extended arm, and foot, and step, and how to build from within, like bees, as the soul does to the body. All is grace. The little man speaks well. - Is this Chevoche? - Yes. - Praise Jesus. - So be it. Does the leper live here? Not here, but nearby. Is this a child in your arms? It is too cold for children to be outside. She is not cold. Here she is. What a pity she is not dead. She wants to eat. - She never forgets that. - Here, faceless woman, you there, hello. - Rotting one. - Catch. Where is she going? It's me, Violaine. - Is that you, mother? - It's your sister, Mara. How good of you to come. - Don't you fear me? - I fear nothing in this world. Your voice sounds like mother's now. Violaine, mother is dead, and father is not back yet. - And you two? - We are well. We have three new plows. You wouldn't recognize Combernon. Are you happy together, Mara? Yes, we are happy. He loves me. Praised be God. Do you not see what I am holding? - I have no eyes. Only the soul's sane. - How do you walk so straight? - I hear. - What do you hear? Things existing beside me. - And me? Can you hear me? - What do you want? - Praise the God that cursed you. - Let us praise him on this blessed day. That chasm mounted on a fish. One must turn to God when all else is gone. He will never let us down. What do you know of what is invisible and never reveals itself? - He is not more invisible than the rest. - He loves you so, little dove. For all the wretched of the earth, his love is great, like the love fire has for wood as it is blazing. He whom you gave your body to has forsaken you. I did not give my body away. Sweet, lying Violaine. Didn't I see you kissing Pierre de Craon? The poor man was a leper, and I was so happy on that day. It was quite innocent, like a little girl kissing a miserable little boy. You didn't leave me Jacques out of kindness. No, I am not that good. Why didn't you explain it to him? I didn't want him to regret our parting. I am happy with him, and I gave him a child. A tender little girl. Will I ever be cured? Not as long as there remains a mortal piece of flesh to be devoured. Will the love in my heart be cured? Never, as long as there's an immortal soul feeding it. - Does your husband understand you? - What man understands a woman? Lucky is she who is understood and gives herself wholly. You transferred your faith to God. Love created pain, and pain created love. What good is a blind love that gives no light and no warmth? If you could spend one night in my skin, you wouldn't say that. There is great misery in this world. Men have no father, they look around, they're lost. My body is going through these trials, in lieu of a vanishing Christianity. Suffering is strong when it is as voluntary as sin. You saw me kiss that leper, Mara. Once your lips have touched pain, it is no longer possible to take them off. My pain is greater than yours. Take it. What is it? My little girl. My child. It's her poor little body. Take it, it's yours. What do you want me to do? I tell you she's dead. Her soul is with God. This nunnery chatter is of no help to me. The milk still burns in my breasts. Her little face is so cold. He knows nothing yet. Was he not home? He's in Rheims, selling his wheat. Who did she look like? Him, but she had my eyes. Poor Jacques. I didn't come here to hear you say 'Poor Jacques'. What do you want? Give her back to me. You only gave me a corpse. I want her alive. Is it in my power to resurrect the dead? What good are you for then? I'm here to suffer, and supplicate. Give her back to me. But you see she's dead. She is not dead,. Give her back to me. You and your God will not take her away from me so easily. It is written that you can blow on this mountain and cast it to the sea. I would be able to, if I were a saint. You must be a saint, since I am begging you. Why did you come to torment me in my tomb? I only want my child. Listen. The bells of Christmas. A child is born. Give me back mine. The wind blows on us. Pray with the whole universe. Do not cry, for the savior of all men was born today. Do you see this book? It has the Christmas service. Prophecy of Isaiah. The people walking in the shadows saw a great light. Those who lived in the shadows of death, light was born for them for a child was born, with the kingdom of God resting on his shoulders, and his name will be admirable, counselor, strong God, father of the future century, prince of peace. Listen. I hear nothing. Go on, Mara. Our beloved savior was born on this day. Let us rejoice. There is no place for sorrow, for on this day a new life begins. The king of France is heading to Rheims. May the sinner rejoice, for he will be forgiven, for the son of God has taken the shape of the human race, so that the inventor of death, the devil, be subjugated, again and again... I am not worthy of this book. Violaine, I want to be different. Read, Mara. You never know who will answer your call. It is also good that he was born in Bethlehem. Bethlehem indeed means the house of bread. What is it? I feel the breath of the new day on my face. Violaine. Did you move your arm? Peace, Mara. It's Christmas day, when joy is born. I announce a great joy, because a man has appeared in this world. Take her, Mara. Or do you want to leave her with me? She lives. She lives. She lives, and so do we. Aubaine, it's me. Do you recognize me? My joy, my treasure. Violaine. What does this mean? Her eyes were black. Now they're blue, like yours. Hope warms our bones, like hot milk. What do you want? Open. - Who is it? - Open, I say. Jacques Hury. Do you not recognize me? Pierre de Craon. It is I. What do you bring here? I took it upon myself to bring her here. - Why here? - She should die under her father's roof. Jacques, here's Violaine. You lepers should stick with each other. I am cured. And she will be cured soon as well. You're more leprous than me or her. Is it true that she kissed you on the mouth? It is true. Poor child. I leave her with you. - Who is here? - I am here, next to you. Hello, Jacques. Are you still angry? Why did you have to kiss the leper on his mouth? We have other things to say to each other. I have nothing to say. Why did you kiss him? He was so sad, and I was so happy. I don't believe you. Cruel Violaine. Not cruel, but tender. Tender Violaine. It is me, it is me alone that you loved. It was too good, and we would have been too happy. If you had believed in me, maybe you would have cured me. How could I not believe my eyes? You had to believe in your eyes, it is true. Must we also be separated by death? I lost you forever. Why did you lose me? You will die. What good is this body for? It was hiding my heart, and you could not see it. Deliverance is nigh. Blessed be the hand that guided me that night. What hand? The hand that silently took mine and guided me. Where? Where Pierre de Craon found me, under a mound of sand, the charge of a whole chariot dumped upon me. Did I get there on my own? Who did that to you? God damn it. I do not know. It does not matter. Do not curse. I will get to the bottom of it. Do not speak in vain. I have little time left. Stay, do not leave. I'll stay. I will not leave. Say, do you remember the spot under my breast that I showed you? Didn't I tell you that I will be in your soul forever? I do not want you to be happy. It is not proper for you to laugh, while you are still away from me. Have this from me, my beloved. The bitterness of a sick man who sees the shadow on the dial, and the soul that receives its vocation. Help me. You accepted nothing from me. Do you think I know nothing about you? Didn't they tell you your child was dead? Mara swears she was only sleeping. Didn't you see that her eyes have changed? They're blue now, like yours. Yes, Jacques. She was dead. Who restored her life? God, and along with him, the faith and despair of her mother. And you. True. When I felt the dead child on me, the child of your flesh, my heart shrunk, as if a blade had penetrated me. I was holding her in my arms, all that I will ever possess from you in this life. Was the child really resurrected? She was dead, and then, all of a sudden, I felt her head move, and life erupted from me, in one jet, in one instant, and my mortified flesh bloomed. I know that little blind mouth, seeking the breast with its pitiless teeth. Do you forgive me? O duplicity of women. You're your mother's daughter. What hand took yours at night, and guided you to your doom? I do not know. I think I know. You know nothing. You know nothing of women, how wretched they are. Was it really her hand? I do not know. What good would it do to know? I am all alone. You are not alone. You have the beautiful child I restored to you. What you need is a clearly defined duty. Happiness is over for me. We were never promised happiness. Work, that is all is asked of you. What is a day away from me? Soon enough, it shall pass, and then, when your turn comes, and you see the big door crack open, I'll be waiting for you on the other side. My betrothed through the blooming branches, I welcome you. You remember. Now, I must leave. I must be moved to the shelter my father built for the poor. No, Jacques. Not you. Call Pierre de Craon. He was a leper. He is not horrified by me. Is everything ready? They are making the coffin. It will be ready tomorrow. Is there enough food for the people under my charge? Old man, your daughter is about to be buried, and this is what you have to say. - What are you looking for, sister? - Flowers, to put on her heart, between her hands. There are no flowers. There are only fruits. Pull the leaves aside, and you'll find the last violet. She is in a deep slumber, like one who knows she is in good hands. My poor daughter who always woke up laughing, in her little bed. Why do you reproach me? It is I who told mother to talk to her on the day you came back from Braine. I ardently desired to marry you. Otherwise, I would have hanged myself on your wedding day. God, who sees in our hearts, had let her to become a leper, but Jacques kept thinking of her. That's why I killed her. So that the one I love and who is mine can be mine completely, like I am his. Should I have allowed this man, who is mine and belongs to me, to be cut in two, one half here, and another in the Chevoche woods? Should I have allowed that my daughter, who is mine, be cut in two, and have two mothers, one for the body, and the other for the soul? Who was faithful to you, Jacques? Me, or Violaine? Violaine, who betrayed you for a leper, following, she claims, God's command, with a kiss? She comes back to me as the night falls. I honor God. May he stay up above. Our miserable life is short. He should let us be. Is it my fault I loved Jacques? Was it for my joy, or my soul's demise? You never loved me. O the disgrace of the unloved woman. My love was not born in happiness, but pain, the pain that is sufficient for those who know no joy. Only I could give you joy. Do you not recognize me? I am your wife. Come along, Mara. Violaine forgives you. It is her, criminal woman, that keeps us united. Dead words. I am weak, like a childless widow. How great it is to live, and how immense is God's glory, but how good too it is to die, when all is over, when the lights are dimmed, slowly, and darkness falls on everything. Poor Violaine. And you, child? Her eyes are so blue. Look, the beautiful rainbow. This is the time when women and newborns teach old and wise men. Is living life's goal? It is not to live, but to die, and give all we have while laughing. That is eternal youth. Do not cry, Jacques, my friend. On my way I saw the churches you built. The stone is beautiful, and pliable in the architect's hand. It preserves the idea, and casts a beautiful shadow. I'll preserve her soul by carving her image in my church. Violaine is not a stone. I do not want the light of her eyes to be covered. Her soul is with us. How beautiful you are, my child. Walk ahead of me, and I will follow you. Violaine, Elisabeth, soon enough I will join you. Marguerite of Paris, lend me your gray boots, so I can go to heaven. What a great day, it is so warm. The little bird flies in the sky and says... I live on death's doorstep, and a great joy is within me. The lord's angel tells us of the coming peace, the child holds on to his mother's bosom. Faithless soul, why do you cry? Because I am going towards my father, and yours. Grace's action reveals the stone in my heart. May I live in harmony with my God, like the vine with the olive trees. The Angelus, ringing again in heaven and on earth, brings the accustomed tidings. Voice of the rose, God is born. God is made man. He speaks. He is resurrected. The 3 notes, like an ineffable sacrifice, are gathered in the virgin's bosom. SUBTITLES BY KANAFANI
