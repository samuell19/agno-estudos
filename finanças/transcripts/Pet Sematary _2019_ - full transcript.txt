Translation: gourmet So many trees. Nice huh? It is certainly not Boston. - No definitely not. Mama, have him stop in front of a church. I think a church is good. I'm not worried about that. We still have at least eight hours to drive. Not funny, Dad. - Certainly. I got you there nicely. Gage, did you find that funny? - I thought it was funny. What do you think about it? Is that all? Impressive, don't you think? We even have a forest as a backyard. This place is all ours? This place is all about it Ellie the Great and the Terrible. You know what, you can go in first. Just go. The movers were here all morning, so everything should be inside. Beautiful. You jerk. Are you OK? - Yes, I was just a little shocked. Gage, big car, right? Are you ready for it? Here we go. One two Three. He adapted quickly. And you? Are you ready for rural life? Let's find out. Wait, the cat is still in the car. It all went so fast. Are you going to miss it? Nobody goes the night shifts miss on the emergency service. That is not really an answer to my question. You needed this. We needed this. I can be more at home. With the children. - And your housewife? I have to think about that. Stop it, don't. How do you like that? Good morning, Marcella. - Ready to get started? Is anyone already there? - Bloody nose, room 4. Sounds serious. Did you hear that? What are they doing? It looks like a precession. What is a precession? It's like a parade, but less pleasant. Let's go in and watch TV. I'm tired of unpacking boxes. Earlier than that. Ellie's birthday is in a few months. Why are you worried, Mom? Everything is fine. The children are happy. It is nice to take it easy. Can I call you back later? Okay, love you, bye. Ellie, are you hungry? PET SEMATARY Make you come down. The art is... to get the sting out quickly. It's a little one. Certainly does not deserve a prize. But you have a ribbon. Look at that. It will soon be less. You're the doctor's daughter? - Ellie Creed, but you can call me Ellie. My name is Judson Crandall. You can call me Jud. Rise. What kind of place is this? Animal Cemetery. Have you seen the sign? - Yes, they wrote it wrong. Are people's pets lying here? - Everyone has been using this place for a long time. I saw those children. They wore masks. Many people make a ritual of it. Do you see this? I made it myself. That's my dog, Biffer. And it's true. He could sniff around. Ellie ... you know you can't just walk away. Mama, this is Jud, our neighbor. I was stung by a bee. He shrugged the sting out. It was a big one. Nice to meet you, ma'am. - Likewise. I'm Rachel, her mother. This forest ... is unsafe to walk. People get lost. Thank you, Jud. We have to go back. You can't run away. If I don't know I can do nothing where you are. Wash the mud off and lubricate some baking soda on the bump. Jud ... come back. Daddy. - Yes? Why do pets live? not as long as people? Do you remember our conversation about metabolism? - The clock in your body? People have a slow metabolism, a slow clock, so live longer. Where cats and dogs are one fast metabolism. If it stops ... - They die and go to the cemetery. Ellie found a cute plate today in the woods. Near our back yard. It doesn't have to be bad, right? A place to bury our pets? It seems scary, but it isn't. It is very normal. Just like dying. We all die and eventually we go back into the ground. What dad is trying to say is that even though the body goes into the ground ... his soul stays alive and goes to heaven. Just like grandma Creed. Do you remember that I said that she looks down on you? We don't really know if it works that way. What mum and dad are trying to say is that you don't have to worry. The church, mommy and me will stay long. And gage? - Of course, Gage is still small. And what about your sister, Mom? Wasn't she small when she died? Rachel. Rachel. Are you OK? - What did that mean? I wanted to ask the same thing. Rachel, Ellie is almost nine years old. We should be able to talk about it. Ellie is a child. And death for her is frightening. We have to protect her from it. - I also do that. I think all that talk about the hereafter ... about people looking down at her ... around it. So you really think there's nothing ... after we die, no heaven, nothing at all? Okay, we're going to have this tested. It can be an allergy ... but certainty for everything. Please say it's lunch time. I can no longer see swollen tongues. Judy went to get lunch. His head. Victor Pascow. He is a student here. The car came out of nowhere. No time for an ambulance. Look what its blood type. Many bags are needed. We have to stabilize him before it can be transported. I'm not letting you die, Victor. Blood type O positive. I get 4 bags. Keep your head back. Hurry with those bags. We need a neck collar. I can see his brain. - Kelly, go now. Victor. Where are those bags? He loses a lot of blood. No, Victor. Stay with me. I'm here. Come on. Come back. Louis ... the barrier must not be broken. He is dead. What happened? A boy was scooped by a car on campus. He... was not older than 20 years. His name was Victor Pascow. I did not expect this to happen here. Come inside. I make some goodies, then you take a shower. I'm sorry. My name... He... never mind. Jud? Ellie here. I made cookies. Are you at home? Do you think it's normal to pass through other people's stuff? Is that your wife? Her name was Norma. - She is beautiful. What happened to her? She fell ill and died. Maybe she's still there. Looking down from heaven? Do you think so, Ellie? - Do you want to see my pet? His name is Church. The short name for Winston Churchill. He lived a long time ago. - I know who Winston Churchill is. You must be very old then. - I'm afraid so. Very nice. Very well. Well done. Can you clap? Well done, honey. - Thank you for coming. It has been a long time since I had a good meal. How long have you been living here? In Ludlow or that house? - Does not matter. My whole life in both cases. Big boy. He likes you. - Me too. Church, nice kitten. - Church, very nice kitten. I'm curious. The broker said it was house with 202 square meters of forest. Are we also the owner of that cemetery? - It's part of your land. How far back is the boundary? Go further than you wish. Come on, doctor. You tried to help me. Let me help you now. This is the place where the dead rest. Now walk further to the place where the dead roam. Stop. The soil is acidic. Wake up, Dad. Hey, kid. Come here. I love you, daddy. Thank you. Time for dad to get up. Good morning, sleepyhead. Did you wake dad up? What time is it? - It is late. You slept late. Hey, girls. - Hello, Ellie. What do you have? - I have sweetcorn, lollipops and ... Who is the sheet and who is the ghost? You look like a ghost. You are already busy. You look great. El ... take your broom with you. Talk to each other. I'll be right back, okay? Do you want to scare the children? - Something you have to see. All right. No, church. One of those damn Orinco trucks. Daddy? - Ellie can't see this. We have to pass the doors with ZoÃ« and Tyler. - I'm having a chat with Jud. I'll enchant you. - You already have. Go to the car and I'll be right there. Go to the children. Then come We return later to clean this up. Louis ... we have to do this tonight. Good. Are you sure? Yes. He was completely perverted. Which means... that we should tell Ellie. We can't just do it say he ran away? Honey, I understand ... that it is hard to cross death to talk, especially after the case with your sister ... but it's time to open yourself up. I'm sorry about Church. - We both know this is about Zelda. Since we live here I keep thinking about her. She hated me because my back didn't was not as twisted as hers. She promised me that one day i would end up like them. I would never get out of bed again. My parents left me alone with her. I had to bring her food. We used a small elevator to get the food but it didn't always work. She died there because of me. I watched her get her body out but they were still in the walls. And in the evening I heard her move. She called my name. I didn't know who to call. If I had just brought her the food. Your parents never had you have to leave alone with her. That makes me a monster. - No, that doesn't make you a monster. That doesn't make you a monster. Listen. Jud and I will take care of Church. We tell Ellie he ran away. Everything but death. I have a place for you. What is it? Nothing. Let's take care of this. It's cold. Ellie really loved that cat, didn't he? - More than anything else. And you love Ellie? Of course. Then follow me. I know where to walk. - Jud, wait. Why not here? Damn. What am I doing? Jud, wait a minute. What kind of place is this? A long way to bury a cat. What is that? It's just a sound. Jeminee. What kind of place is this? Are you feeling better? Bury your cat. I would like to help you but you have to do it yourself. Use some stones to tidy it up. Not like those others. What are we doing here tonight, Jud? - We'll bury your daughter's cat. Only that? - Nothing else. You did well, Louis. I knew you would do that. What time is it? - It is late. Did you and Jud arrange it? - Yes, it happened. Thank you. What is it? It's about Church. Dad and Jud have last night searched for Church. We searched everywhere, but could not find him. We think Church ran away. He didn't run away. He sat by my window last night. Honey, maybe you saw him in your dreams. You can be confused with all this. You will have to accept that he maybe not coming home. Sorry sweetheart. He came back yesterday. See, he's over there. I thought you said he was dead? - That was true. He must be unconscious been in shock. Fortunately you are not a vet. We have to talk. Ellie's cat walks around as if nothing happened. What the hell. - What does that mean? Did you not want that? Save your daughter from the truth? You also saw that he was dead. - I didn't deny that. How can you explain that? - That is not possible. Nobody can do that. You will have to come up with something better. There are places in this world ... who are older than both of us. Places that even someone with one doctor's brain. Nobody knows what that place is. What happens in that stony soil. The bottom of a human heart is stony. What we did last night ... we did for Ellie. It is now your cat. Bull that was deemed dead found on Main Street Veteran Timothy Baterman ... loss of the carcass ... Ludlow Animal Cemetery What the hell? 666 River Road Ludlow Maine Tribal Lands. That is where we are. Along the swamp. Where did you take me, Jud? Church, you stink a lot. What did you do outside? Calm down, Church. There is something nasty in your fur. That's right. Let me see. Does that feel good to you? I want to go back to our old house. We moved here to it take it easy so that ... we could spend more time with you. Up... so daddy has more to take you to to bring a bed. So that everything is safe. So daddy can tickle you before he wishes you good night. I promise you'll be fine, just like your arm. Do you trust me? Sleep tight. Daddy? Close the door completely. I don't want Church to come in. I love you. How's she doing? - Good. About everything. What about Church? No idea. Will have been the accident. He was wild this morning. And you? Fine. Come here. It has been difficult the past months. Jesus. Louis, it's still alive. Damn. Church. Come from there. Your destruction and the destruction of all your loved ones, doctor is approaching. Rachel, what happened? I do not wanna talk about it. Is it the bird? - No, that's not it. I think it's wrong that we moved here. It doesn't feel right, Louis. Do you remember why we do moved here? We have... Ellie's birthday is coming. Let's do something special, a party? We can... invite some friends from Boston. Even invite your parents, okay? We can turn this around. They look good. What is this? No idea. Gage signed that. It's all right, come on. I was eleven when I lost Bif. He was stuck in barbed wire. Dad had to shoot him, to release him from his suffering. So your father brought you there? - No. He was called an old man Stanley Bouchard. He told me about it. The Wendigo. He used to hear there much left in the North. He was a myth. By the local tribes sent this way. For them it was not a camping story. They believed in it. They were afraid of it. Are these the trees there? - Yes, those are warnings. The local tribes they engraved before they fled. Fled? - They knew the power of that place. They felt its appeal. They believed that the forest belonged to something else. The ground was bad. Acid. The soil is acidic. So they went on, but not until they had built that trap. They built it to keep people out, but it didn't keep people out. The Wendigo can also be a crazy fairy tale. But there is something there. Something that brings things back. What happened to your dog? He came back. As Stanley B predicted, but he had changed. When he went after my mother, my father shot him ... for the second time. I thought it was different would walk with Ellie's cat. Bif already had a mean character, but Church ... was a nice cat. - I thought he would hurt Gage. I'm really sorry, Louis. As soon as you feel the power of that place ... you come up with the best excuses to go back. But I was wrong. Sometimes death is better. Calm down, then you can sleep. Damn it, Church. Come on. Good luck. Congratulations Congratulations Congratulations, dear Ellie Congratulations Well done, Ellie. I want a piece of the end. Are you still thinking about Church? It's my fault he left. I told him to leave my room. - No darling. Church loves you. Maybe this makes you happier. Just squeeze it. I think it's great, Dad. - Really? I love you. Go enjoy your birthday. Six seven eight nine ten. I am a monster. Where are you? Bring it on. Church? You came back. Okay, you are now. Honey, where is ... Gage. Incoming call. Church. I keep thinking ... that I hear her coming up the stairs. And that she comes home after school. I can't be here now. I handle some things here. Come soon, I love you. - I love you too. Be good, kid. Take good care of mommy. I'll see you in a few days. Why did I see Rachel and Gage leave? To mourn ... at her parents. So only you are still there? I will drive there in a few days. I still have some things to do. Which is good. It's hard now to be separate from each other. When you came here, I was relieved. I wanted to visit you. I should never have shown you that place. But you did. I understand that you know what to do ... but she will not return as the same. I am so sorry. I did this. Ellie is the first person who has my heart has been hit for a long time. I didn't want her to be sad. It's that damn place. It feeds itself with the sadness in your mind. Damn. I have to close my eyes. Why don't you lay in bed? - I waited for your call. I called earlier. Yes, I saw that. I was with Jud. We had a drink. Can't you come to us? Gage needs you and I ... I'm really crazy, dear. Is it okay if we continue talking tomorrow? I love you. - I love you too. Day. Damn. Louis, stop. - I'm sorry I couldn't help you. Let her go. - I can make up for this. Pascow. Honey, come here. It's all right. Go home. - Pascow said we should go home. There is nothing there. There is nothing there. Dad is almost there. Sorry. Daddy. Where am I? My little girl. You are at home. Home. What is it? It's just a burdock. Where are Mommy and Gage? They are grandma and grandpa. Are they still coming back? I remember my birthday. Church walked on the road. He was so happy that he came home. There was a truck ... and then everything went black. Now everything is fine. You're back. Back from where? It's time to go to sleep. I turn off the light. I'm dead for sure? No darling. You are here. Do you want to stay with me? Of course. I can hear the forest. The windows are closed. That is not what I mean. From the inside. Does Mama know how I am? - Please close your eyes. It'll be fine. I love you, daddy. I love you too. Be careful. Honey, stop it. Stop that. Put your dress back on. What are you going to tell her? Call declined. I'm going crazy. Something happened yesterday. Gage had a nightmare and he called the name of that deceased boy. I'm going crazy and Gage too. I want you just hear. Please call back. Traffic update: Great delay with the I95. Are you OK? Jud, with Rachel. You were with your parents, right? - I'm on my way back. Something is going on. I'm worried about Louis. Can you see if everything is fine with him? I've been calling him all morning. - Doesn't he answer? I've tried it so many times. - I'll stop by. Thank you, Jud. I'll be there soon. - Until then. Louis. Are you there? Hey, Jud. How are you doing today? Totally fine. I don't remember you leaving. - You fell asleep. Listen, I have to go back inside. I've been waiting for Rachel's all morning phone call and I don't want to miss it. If you've done something, Louis ... then it is not too late to undo it. You don't have to worry about it make me, Jud. It's fine. Really. If that's all ... I go back inside. I know you are here. Hello, Jud. - Stop it, Ellie. Calm down. Your dear Norma, is burning in hell for what you did to her. I saw her there. - Shut up. You know nothing about her. Did you miss me Judson? - That's not my Norma. Ellie is suffering. You did this to her. It's not you. - You told Louis about that place ... and now we are suffering ... forever. But now we are here to get you back so that you can suffer with us. Give it a try. Damn. Rachel, what are you doing ... - You're fine. Thank God. I was worried. I called you but you didn't answer and ... Gage had nightmares and called the name of that boy who died. I'm here now. I need you and no one else, just you, me and Gage. It's all right, honey. Look at you daddy boy. Have you grown? Have you grown taller? Is not it? Much bigger and you smell so good. You smell so good. Louis, what's the matter? I needed more time with her. Come here. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to her. You scare me. Tell me what you are talking about. It was my fault that she died. I had to bring her back. Ellie. The Great and the Terrible. There is a place deep in the forest ... past the animal cemetery. It brings things back. Aren't you happy, Mom? Embrace your daughter. Embrace your daughter. No. She doesn't want me here. Mama needs time. It's all right. I don't want her here either. Rachel, please open it. Let me explain. I know. Let me explain. What is she That's Ellie. We buried her. - She was returned to us. We have a second chance. - That's not how it works. There is a place in the forest what I told you about. I didn't get it either until I buried Church ... that cat was dead until I got him there and it brought him back. You have not been yourself after that. You saw it yourself. You touched her. That's our daughter. That is really our daughter, please. I did what I thought was right. Let God take his own child away. Ellie, mom and dad ... It's all right, sweetheart. Mommy is fine. Mom... Rachel. Now you will never get out of bed again. Stop struggling, useless cow. Ellie? Jud? My God. Louis, catch Gage. Rachel. - Capture Gage. Ellie is trying to kill me. Capture Gage. - Let him go. Daddy has you. Come on. Daddy wants you to stay in the car. Do the nobody's door open. Not even Ellie. You let me die that way. You didn't do anything. Just like with your sister. I was scared. You are lying. You hoped your sister would die. - That's right. Remember when Dad said that there is nothing after this? He was wrong. It is not heaven. You're going there soon, Mom. Don't call me mommy. You are not my daughter. Ellie is dead. Then you can accompany her. Rachel, Gage is safe. - Don't bury me in that place. You're too late. Where is mommy? Mama is already feeding herself to the ground. What have you done? You started this, dad. When you brought us here. When you buried Church. When you buried me. Stop fighting, dad. It will be better this way. Please just go. I thought we could be a family, but that is not possible. You can, dad. Really. Translation: gourmet
