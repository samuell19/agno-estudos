Wake up, damn you! You gotta sleep with one eye open, it's when you're sleeping that they fuck you. That bastard, been a pain in the ass all night. Dad... AS GOD COMMANDS Wake up, it's late. Give me my cigarettes. - Cristiano? - I'll miss the bus. Go on, but first give a kiss to the only one you've ever loved. - You're disgusting. - Look who's talking. Come on, kiss me. Is my son a fag? - Fuck off! - Not on my head! Did I hurt you? I can always trick you! Let me up. Only if you give me a kiss. My son really is a fag, that sucks! You're an asshole. Bye, love! The Nazis were born in Germany and owe everything to Adolf Hitler, their devisor. He wanted Germany to be the most powerful country in the world and conquer all of Europe, but to do it, he had to kick the Jews out. He invented the swastika and told the Germans he would free the country from the Jews. He did it because, along with Napoleon, he was the greatest man in history, even though he comes off as superior to Napoleon. We could use Hitler today, too to rid Italy of all the Negroes and third-world trash stealing our jobs, and to help real Italians find work. The problem is, no one in Italy believes in his country. Thank you. See what a nice surprise the Lord's given us? Snow. Everyone is frozen solid... The street is totally blocked. A snowplow! My love. Move. Not you, the scooter! Sir? Rino! Did you see all the snow last night? Pick it up. Say you're sorry. His name's Four Cheeses, say: "Sorry, Four Cheeses." Sorry, Four Cheeses. Let's go. You retard, when will you learn to get respect? Is Friday okay? They've already organized the squad for Friday. - It's been closed quite a while. - Closed? It's posted back there. Negroes, Slavs, Africans... why, do Italians suck? Don't take it out on me, you know my mind. Where are the cement factory invoices? Hi, Zena. Look who's here! Great, you take Negroes, slaves from the East and pay them peanuts. And me and Four Cheeses? We busted our backs for ten years for this company. Illegal, no fucking insurance. You forgetting your naked wires made him like this? Truth is... You don't give a shit for this country or for those bastards who come here stealing our bread. Right? Let's go, Four. What time is Cristiano coming out today? At 1:30. It's a Chip and Dale! He loves you. Zena? You didn't turn in your homework, right? Like it? Have you ever kissed a girl with piercing? Have you ever kissed a girl? "The Arabs, Romany and gypsies are even worse than Jews. They behave like masters in our own house. We have to attack and exterminate them like the Jews. The End." Summa cum laude! You handed that stuff in? I'm not stupid. Did you let anyone read it? I know you, you let your buddies read it. Are you deaf? I wrote it and put it in my pocket. Fuck it, how many times have I told you? Never talk about the things we say. They just can't wait to shove it up our asses. I didn't hand it in, I swear to God. Never swear in God's name, I'll kill you! How do you get certain ideas? Why won't you believe me? Cut that whiney voice, no one's hurting you. Are you a little girl? Cristiano doesn't tell lies. Shut up, dimwit. Don't stick your nose in, I'm talking to my son. Let's go. - Give it back. - Why burn it? So there's no evidence. Thieves could steal it, or aliens. Let go of me, piss off. I don't want to talk to you. Hear me out, then leave if you want. If I get mad, there's a reason. If you turned it in, the teacher would give it to the social worker and you'd go straight to an institute. Is that what you want? I told you I didn't hand it in, but you won't believe me. We make one slip and we're fucked forever. If they split us up, I... When I tell you things, you have to believe me. I'll believe you only if you beat me. If you can get up there before me. Don't tell me you can't do it. You're young, I'm an old man. Bastard. Go Cristiano! I root for Cristiano because he's nicer! No fair! You're a shit, it's no fair. I let you win just because you're an old man. Good, you should respect the elderly. You wrote a good essay. But a guy has no freedom to say what he thinks. Freedom... is a word used to screw people. Know the only ones who have it? The rich, people with money. They have it, freedom! Want to see my freedom? This young lady here is called Freedom, and her surname's 357 Magnum. It's beautiful! - And the other one? - What a pain! You ask questions, instead of asking to try it. Is it loaded? Help! Four! Here he is. Hurry up and tuck your shirt in. No smile for your affectionate social worker? So Rino, tell me about work. I went, but I'm not Slav or African. Keep being an asshole, then we'll see what you tell the judge. You have to find a job. Next week I'm delivering plants for the Baldini Nursery. The Baldini Nursery! A hand! That's two days of work? You should put a signature on this document. - What is it? - How much do you drink? Wake up! Start doing things seriously or Minors Court will take Cristiano and put him in an institute. Is that what you want? I bet not. What should I do? Start attending this seminar on alcoholism, find a steady job, stop raising havoc on the streets and remember you're a father and have responsibilities toward your son. Attention everyone! We are gathered here to welcome a new friend. A Pinocchio! Welcome, Pinocchio. Who's this here? You were hiding, didn't you want to say hello to Pinocchio? Easy! What the fuck? Do you shoot up? - Want some? - Disgusting. You're a junkie. Are you a shitty Nazi? Fuck off! Leave me alone! Get out of here. Get out or I'll kill you. Sleep. Go away. I can't give it to you, men eat pizza and dogs... bones. Got a light? Ramona! Ramona Superstar! You're mistaken. I watch you all the time. He sent you, didn't he? Hi, Zena. Always alone, got no friends? But you're the cutest guy in school. Not as cool as your father, but still cool. - You know my father? - We've seen him around. Where did he get all his tattoos? Ask him. - Who the fuck is he? - A kid from school. This deadbeat's a friend of yours? Why don't you fuck off? He's mean! Yeah, he's a tough guy. Let's go, we're late. What the fuck are you doing? Bring me a beer. - I'm going to bed, get it yourself. - No, you will. - What happened? - Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? - Nothing. - What did you do? - Got in a fight. Stop. Does your back hurt? A little. Can you bend over? It's nothing serious. And you? Did you hurt him? You didn't fucking touch him. You don't know how to defend yourself. My son can't defend himself! It's all my fault, I'm an idiot. I haven't taught you a fucking thing. He's a karate champion, he won the regionals. - Who? - Alex. - Who's Alex? - The one who beat me up. So you think a guy who does martial arts knows how to fight? Know what you need to fight? You gotta be nasty. Butt me in the head. Butt me in the head. Come on, Dad... If you can't do it to me you'll never be able to do it to anyone, see? So fucking butt me in the head. Come on, just do it. Here. Do it! Sorry. Look at the blood, good kid. Let's forget it, please. - Think I'm a jackass? - We can't bullshit. - He started it. - They'll put me in an institute. He's 18, you're 14, he's the one in deep shit. You're just getting respect. Any hitches and we'll show him our girl. OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN, STAY THERE! Is that him? What time is it? - It's late, I have to go home. - Sleep here. If I don't go, my fucking father will kill me. You're a jerk, you're a nobody! I'll kill you. That's enough, you want to kill him? Don't worry, he got the message. Mister? Fuck! Are you alright? Should I call someone? My love! Get away from me! You were looking for me. Wait! God sent you here. I've waited for you all my life. Don't run away! I love you. See? God wants you to be with me all your life. Wait a minute, wait here for me. I'll be right back. Ramona! I was asleep. What? Calm down and talk louder. Stop crying, tell me where you are. Try harder, where the fuck are you? Four! Where are you? Come out in the open. Come on! Have it out with me. Where the fuck are you? Who did this? Who did it? I didn't do it on purpose. I just wanted to make love. What the fuck did you do? Come and see what you did. I'll kill you! Now you're gonna die. Hear me? Now you're gonna die. Oh God! What did you do? You did it! Dad, the phone! Alex, is that you? I know it's you, talk! What the fuck do you want? Leave me alone. Stay away from this house or I'll get my father up. Hear me? Cristiano! Madonnina... Dad, is it you? What? I don't understand, talk louder. Did you say Madonnina? The Chapel of the Madonnina. Answer the phone, Four! Where are you? What's the matter, can you hear me? Help! You can't do this to me. Please. You fucking bastard! I knew it, you can't die. I'll go find help. What did you do? What did you do? Sir, can you hear me? - Is he your father? - Yes. How long's he been like this? He was like this when I found him. - What did he do last night? - He went to bed. - Is he an addict? - No. Does he have any illnesses? He always has headaches. Take him away, please. Give him oxygen and let's go. Are you Cristiano Zena? I'm Enrico Brolli, I operated on your father. Is he dead? Who said he's dead? Be straight with me, I won't cry. Come on, let's go see him. It's me, it's Cristiano. I'm sitting by you, I'm here. I'm holding your hand. You're in the hospital, in a coma, but you'll wake up soon, don't worry. The doctor said you had a hemorrhage, but your brain is healing, so you shouldn't worry. Listen, I took care of everything, no one will find out a thing. I can't come all the time. Maybe you can't hear me, but I'll tell you anyway: I said you got sick at home, while you were sleeping, understand? At home. - Where are the keys to the van? - What? I can't get by, I have to move it. - Leave it there. - It's in the way. I'll go. - I know how to drive. - Yeah, sure. Give me the fucking keys. You scared I'll steal it? Help me back up, the mirrors are broken. We'll do some shopping tomorrow. Are you staying here? Yes, for a while, then I have to go home. And me? We'll see. I'll go to an institute, right? We have to hear the judge, but here all by yourself, that's a tough one. I can ask Four Cheeses to come. He'd come, that's perfect, right? Out of the question. Four Cheeses has it rough on his own. Eat your spaghetti, it's getting cold. Get in the car, it's raining. There's nothing to look at, come on. Get off my ass! What the fuck do you want from me? Just leave me alone. What's there to look at? Fuck off, you shits. God! He got sick at home, while he was sleeping. They took him away in an ambulance. In a coma means he's gonna die? Do you love him? A whole lot. If they send me to an institute, he'll be alone. Promise me you'll never leave him and when he wakes up, you have to tell him... He'll wake up? I don't know, but you have to say I told everyone he got sick at home. Understand? I don't understand why you won't say where he got sick. Why won't you tell me, because I'm stupid? What is it? Tell me what you'll say. I know, I have to tell him not to worry because you took care of everything and he got sick at home. Can he hear us? I don't know. Hi, Rino. It's been hours! Don't worry, I know why you beat me up. You've always defended me, just you, in the whole world. I know, when you died in the woods, you did it for me, so everyone would think you did it and I'd be saved. Believe you me, I understand certain things. It's just that... now God has decided not to let you die, I don't know why. Why? I don't understand You anymore. But don't worry, don't worry, you'll see, you'll die now. You'll die now, don't worry. What are you doing here? Who let you in? It's not visiting hours. Leave at once. Why do You ask this of me? I'd written about my daughter, about the marvelous person she was, about her dreams. They say that God created people in His likeness. I don't understand though... so He also created the monster who killed my daughter? How can He have watched it all, a child thrown off her scooter, raped and beaten to death with a stone? God should have deafened us all with his hollering. He should have darkened the heavens, God... our Father! But He did nothing. Days are passing and nothing's happening. They say God forgives, I want to see that man dead. In the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Dear brothers and sisters, we know that our earthly life will end in death. Nonetheless, when we encounter it along our path, it surprises and devastates us. Him... Where is he? My son. Lord, hear my voice. May Your ears hear my prayer. I hope in the Lord, my soul hopes in His word... If he comes, don't tell him anything. I want to surprise him. May the Almighty Lord have mercy upon us, forgive our sins and lead us to eternal life. Come, Saints of God, hasten, Angels of the Lord... Four! Open up, they're sending me to an institute! Are you here? Why? Your son's coming. Aren't you going in? Don't be afraid. Dad, it's Cristiano. It was Four Cheeses who did it, not you. But I did think it, I thought you did it. How could I?
