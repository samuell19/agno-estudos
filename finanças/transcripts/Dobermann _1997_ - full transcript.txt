Eternal and Almighty God! You can make the deaf hear... and the blind see. You sent your Son to this world to free us from the grip of evil Satan, so that man, torn from darkness, may enter the Kingdom of Light. We pray to You for this child. Redeem him from original sin. Let him shine in Your presence and May the Holy Spirit live in him. Yann, I baptize you in the name of the Father... the Son... and the Holy Ghost. Look... He has the same mean look as your dog. It's that priest water. It's too cold. Come on... We better leave him alone. Wait up. Wait! I have a present for him. A real beauty. A 357 Magnum. Nono the Armenian fixed it up. Aim for the stomach and you still blow off the head. I want to carve a skull in the butt. Put that away. This is no place for it. Isn't he too young? What do you mean? A man needs a gun! He needs a real baptism now. A baptism by fire! Fuck! You like her? No. You don't? You like her or not? Yeah, I like her. Isn't she hot? You want to go in the van? Five minutes. You and her. In the van. Uniforms turn her on. Better yet, she's totally deaf. Talk as dirty as you want. You're disgusting! You pissed in your pants, you little shit! Go change. These days, no one lives long in uniform. Out! It was in. It was out! Out? Are you blind? It was in by a mile! Game, Pitbull. Service, Pitbull. "Game Pitbull, service Pitbull." Listen to the crow up there! For him, Platini means noodles. Okay, Mosquito. We'll call it out. What do I care? Fifteen - love. There goes your ball. If anyone's interested, I got plenty more. What's the life of a loser to me? I'm sick of working near those Nazis. I swear, I'm sick of it. Buy some ear plugs. They're on vacation. Life's cool. Cool? Is this cool? Look how they play tennis. Cool? Are you kidding? They're wound up tight. See that little ball of hate? He whipped out his gun... and - bam! - blew up that tennis ball. The gang's under surveillance. He'll be joining them. This time he won't get away. I can picture it like I dreamt it. I wasn't dreaming. I was there. Who's he? I don't know. He got in last night. What breed is that? Pitbull. No, that's not a pitbull. I meant the guy. Jacky Sweat. Alias, Pitbull. Specialist in brass knuckles and armed robbery. Armed with an ax. An ax? They're regrouping. Looks like it. So girls, creaming over chicken thieves? We're not lucky enough to torture 15-year-old dealers. That's weird, my hands smell like meat. Is that big, bad Dobermann? Yeah, that's him. He looks like a junkie. They all look like junkies. Guns and needles... the latest craze. Latest craze. I'd have killed them by now. Sure. But you're not in on this. You're out in the cold, Christini. Internal affairs has heaps of complaints against you. So go play Gestapo downstairs and leave us alone. Yes, Captain. He could have called. Not his style. Let's get an answering machine for when we do sports. You're right. Save us from waiting for nothing. Why are you painting? We leave in 3 days! What happened in here? - You want to know? - Yeah. A golden boy. Bankruptcy. He settled things with a rifle. His wife. His three kids. And himself. Fuck it! All these stains freak me out. They're above my bed. I may have the kids' bed. Fucking pain! Why don't they kill the guys who ruin their lives? Lack of faith drives men mad. Lack of faith! It's lack of money! Death hovers over you, gringo. I know. My sister! Stop... Let go of my dick. It's sis. Business is starting up again? Could be. Any coffee lying around? Coffee keeps me up. Must be a beer in the icebox. We're twins. We're the same. The same exact thing! I put your knife back, okay sis? My pretty little sister... Manu, what are you doing? Stop feeling her up. She'll cut off your balls. She's my sister! She's mine! Exactly... So cut the shit, shut your face, and crush the Corvette. You're a pain, Yann. Why don't you ever use jalopies? I don't know. For legend's sake. For legend's sake! I don't give a fuck about legends! Manu! Don't sell it! Don't sell it! Come here. Did you think of me? I always do, champ. You want me to crush it? Come see your guns. No time... I'll take them all. He scratched it. There's a hold-up going down? Bigger. Much bigger. I need 30 ghosts. Get me Dud, Torpedo and the Mamou brothers. All the brothers? That's a lot. For when? Tomorrow. Go now. Bastard! Asshole! Shithead! - It's you. - Are you coming? Not this weekend. - Why not? - Because I can't! You think I'm dumb? I don't think you're dumb. I'm busy. Can't you understand? They're your kids. I know they are. The next two weekends, okay? The next two in a row. You're sure? Sure. It's definite. Call me tomorrow. Tomorrow! Pain in the fucking ass! Probably some drunk! I'll set him straight. Calm down. Stop doing lines. They make you nervous. Let me deal with this. I'm dressed for it. Nervous... I'm not nervous. Are you? So, Abbot... you're out here unprotected? What's this, infidel? A halo? Nat the Gyspy. Hi there, Princess. We've been waiting for you. With high hopes, I might add. Thanks for doing the shopping. Yeah, thanks. Who did you rob for that? I don't rob. I invest. Sign language is great for cheating. Can you teach me? You hold up, we hole up. Thanks for inviting us. What? - Has he been hyper for long? - Weeks. He's feeling antsy. He dreams of banks and looting. He thinks cops have become a mere mirage. I'm considering my options. Difference. He's lost touch with reality. He slips away when we mention security doors video surveillance and drop-bottom tills. And electronic banking? As for banks without tellers, how will you hold them up? With a fax? Yann, tell him what century we're in. We've given up on him. Not only banks are getting modern. Sonia just delivered a laser-guided machine gun. Real Maverick missiles. No security door can stop them. When you enter the bank, the blast plasters them to the wall. The blast plasters... That's beautiful. It's Christmas. I can smell the pine. Clodarec, here. Some news from the villa. A couple came and they all just left. When I know more, I'll call. Jesus Christ! It's going down! A couple came and now they've all left. It's them. It's Dobermann. I can fucking smell him! - Who's tailing? - Caseneuve and Tronchet. Reiner on the Yamaha. There's a tracer on their car. It's our lucky day. We can't lose. I want everyone on the emergency channel. Let's not jump the gun. If they went out bowling, you'll look stupid. Bowling? With three cars? No. They're holding up a bank. Definitely. We have an appointment. You get your license in a cereal box? Hey, champ. Come here... If anything happens, watch out for Nat. She'll kick me out. You know her. Don't let her. What is it? You make a cute blond. What? The wig looks great on you. Scratch it and I'll slice you up. I'll park it, dress like a good boy, and go see my parents for my birthday. So don't worry. I never worry, okay? Leave me your number. What does Mom think you do? Law school. She sees me in my black robe. Goddamned faggot! I want to come along. What will you do? Suck off the security guard? Why does she put on make-up before each heist? Girls who get nabbed are dogs. So? It's on purpose. To set a bad example. They'll say you're a fag! You better watch out! Are you crazy or what? You're sick! Hi there, baby doll! Goddamned circus! Let's go! Nat's deaf, but retarded too? You're not wearing a disguise? For the papers. I'd rather be me. Who's doing the phony hold-ups? Leo, Manu, Torpedo, Dud and the Mamous brothers. The whole family? - All clowns! - Not everyone will laugh. See you! Later, Sonia! Don't forget my birthday! Gare de l'Est. We've been had. I don't get it. What the hell? Fox 3 to Z1. Come in, please. Go ahead, Fox 3. A Mercedes with five people. Exit number 3. Heading towards the Louvre. Fox 4 to Z1. Come in, please. Go ahead, Fox 4. We lost them. A lady's driving the Lamborghini. Don't lose the tracer! Armed robbery, Boulevard Sebastopol. Hold-up at Republique. Bomb scare in subway station... Fire alarm triggered in shopping mall... Your dumb-ass heists seem to work. They'll never find enough cops. What next? Meter maids? - They're decoys. - Butt out! The joyride's over. We're heading to La Defense. That one's for us! Come on, Christini's right! We're wasting our time on phony heists. On ghost jobs! There are no cops left. Postpone this. No way! One ghost will materialize and I'll be there! Coming, Christini? When I go to a massacre, I set it up. Mass ignorance in technicolor. They couldn't find Al Capone in a box of popcorn. Fox 4 to Z1... Fox 4 to Z1... Go ahead, Fox 4. The lady parked her Lamborghini at the Olympia Hotel. Awaiting orders... Fox 4 awaiting orders. Feel like getting back into action? What's your call? Tail the car. I'll grease up City Hall by promising Dob's demise. - And Fox 4? - Axe them. Forget the Mouseketeers. It's you and me again. Unless Mickey kills Dob. The odds are in our favor. Slow down! We don't know where we're going. The door, please! She likes blowing things up! Fox 1 here. Go ahead, Fox 1. It's the Credit Bank in La Defense. Get into position. - Faster, faster! - Make up your mind. She busted my ear drum. Ma'am... See that, Godzilla! Bankie go boom! You named him Godzilla? I loved Godzilla as a kid. I have all the cassettes. They were great. Too bad it's over. Give me your positions. Not in the street. It's too crowded. We won't lose them. They fell right into my trap. Your trap is full of holes. It's for idiots. - They're leaving. - Go on, David. Get moving! They're slowing down. They can't rob two banks in a row! They're out now. The Union Bank. - Don't move. - Keep calm... Where are they? Sir... I can't lie down... I'm too old. Just stand there. It's Corinne, dickhead! - No, I'm working! - So you work now? We'll get off later. So pay your alimony! I just wanted 500 francs. You forget your alimony, your kids... I haven't forgotten! I have an overdraft! I'm in trouble with my bank! - You owe me 30,000. - How much? All this? You don't mind? Who are you? The Queen of France? We're not thieves. Fuck off! All done. Let's go. Relax, relax... Just wait. A snag. What snag? Two are still inside. They'll take the other car. No... they're staying. Godammit! They won't fuck us! Fox 1 and 3, keep the exits clear. Don't move until I say so. Wait until I say so! I don't want them taking hostages. Soon they'll think the coast is clear. That's when we nab them, okay? Okay, Lefevre? Okay. It won't work. It will! There are 2 of them and 6 of us. They're not expecting us. It was me! Don't blow your first job. Don't move! Don't worry, ma'am. Suck on this! Don't do it! So? His head fucked up my gun! I hate masks. The cops are here! We're still inside. We're coming. The cops showed up. Behind you! Shit! It's stuck! Shoot him! Where is he? An invisible biker straight from hell! Grab him! Scum! Let's go for a ride! The helmet! Go on, Abbot. The grenade! His light will shine on you... He's hanging on! ...and make you strong. You shall call out and the Lord will answer. He will say... Get away! "Here I am!" - Blood all over! - It's the cop. It's sticky! It's nothing. It's not the cop. It's dog hair! Shit... it's Godzilla. What's going on? I'll fake his suicide! Great idea! Fuck! How much longer can this bitch nag me? It's Yann. I thought it was my wife. It's swarming with cops! We're coming! We're coming! I'll stay on. Yann's coming. That's nice. Cops everywhere. - I'll kill them! - Wait! He'll be our shield. - You can come out! - Okay, we're coming. Hey, you losers! Drop your weapons... That's it... very good. Nice and easy... Excellent. Come on, you little pigs. Oink, oink, oink... Your gun! Thanks, guys. For my collection. There's my taxi! We're off! I said it wouldn't work. We win, so suck my tit! You lose, so eat my shit! I'll be fine. Godzilla! Where's Godzilla? I'm sorry. When I opened the door, he got out. What? - Turn around! - It'll be crawling with cops. I don't care! I want my dog! Stop it, Pitbull! Hands off or I'll kill you! Here's Godzilla. There was a cop shooting at us point blank. The Lord punished him. He's in the Paradise of Headless Men. What? In other words... we blew his face off. I'll dig him a great grave. Like no other dog's ever seen. Then I'll de-bone me a cop! Deal. - Fair is fair. - Fuck yeah! Fuck this! Get your sandwiches! Cold drinks! Hot sauce? No, just some mustard. The whore left the hotel disguised as a boy. A drag queen? We know her from our days in Vice. Olivier Brachet. Remember? Cocksucking Sonia? Himself. Look what was in the car. Jesus! That blow-job artist works with Dobermann. Great! Where is our Miss World? There, visiting her parents. We'll stop by. You're not hungry? Whatever... Is that Fox 4? Tell him to scram. Get lost. It's our case now. Beat it! The Commissioner gave you the case? Are you sure? Fuck! Motherfucker! Shut up! Understand now? She's bleeding! Police! Call the police! This area is hopping. I like it. It looks great, but it's enough for an army. Eat. You're all skin and bones. You never mention school. Because it's going well. When can you get a job? I don't know. You don't become a lawyer overnight. You have a wife and child. Listen... For now, we can help. Let him study in peace. Eat, I'll get it. Are you expecting someone? What is it? Police. That's what. Sit. Do you mind if I call you Sonia? Then I'll call you Olivier. It's better for the family. Do you know them? We can talk elsewhere. Why? Aren't we comfy here? It's just us family, Sonia. Why is he calling you Sonia? Why won't you speak? Why are you with Dob? Robbing banks for fun isn't human. You have to respect money. You have to deserve it. Don't you? Dobermann deserves to be holed up. Holed up six feet under! Who are you talking about? I'm talking about Dobermann, faggot! Easy, easy. No more Mr Nice Guy. How's tricks, Sonia? Business must be booming. You got a Lamborghini. Is that beauty yours? Imagine how many miles of cock he sucked. It's not humanly possible. We found this in your car. Now we recognize you! You don't mind having a son who sucks dick? You don't mind that he sucks dick all day long? What is it? Goddamned bastard! Your mommy's not too polite. Tell them they're wrong! Tell them! Yeah... Tell us we're wrong. Tell us... Tell us! They came for me. I'm not in school. I'm a whore. Shut up! No, I won't. I'm almost a lawyer. They fuck others. I get fucked. Stop giving me all that medicine, Mom. My farts come from getting butt-fucked. Good going, Sonia. You prefer to destroy your family... So you have a kid. Fuck and get fucked. Heads and tails... Where's Dobermann? Baby stinks and passes gas, While Daddy gets it up the ass. I love kids. No kidding. I wish I'd had one. We'd have had fun. Playing together for hours. Too bad. Too late. Don't move, bitch! Put Baby Fairy back. Look what you make me do. All this, just to protect a faggot. Where's Dobermann? I toss your kid, pistol-whip your wife, no Dob! What's inside your head? Not the Big Dream. It sucks. Especially on his birthday. No kidding. His birthday? That changes everything. I won't be accused of being a party-pooper, even if the birthday boy is an ingrate. I have a present for everyone. Here, kid. Stop. Have a blast. I really blew his brains out! Bang, no more cop! Viewfinder... The picture's amazing! Too bad there's no slo-mo. Those cops have hard heads. I'd tried icing him and it didn't work. Come say a prayer for Godzilla. Fuck him good! Bang bang bang! A prayer for my dog. I'm going. Already? See you tonight at Joe's. Mosquito! You want a ride? Is Sonia coming to Joe's? Yeah, I need my car back. Call her first. Why? The cops came fast. Cops all over was your idea. Including our sector, right? Two cops down is no joke! I won't ditch my car just because you're nervous. I'll call her. Okay. Lord... Playing horsey on Daddy's horse... It's Mosquito. Is that you? No, it's the Pope. How's my car? It's okay... Your voice is weird. The elevator is broken. I'm out of breath. No snags? No, no problems. Are the old folks there? We just blew out the candles. Runs in the family! What do you mean? The art of blowing! - See you later. - I'll see you tonight. So? They'll be at Joe Hell. The club on the canal with the skull and crossbones. You'll be there too. Fresh as a daisy, happy as a clam... That's impossible. Of course it's possible. I know my inspector. He's a good cop. But as a babysitter, he's impatient. Relax, Sonia. Tonight's party will knock your socks off. And you'll be the queen. Champagne time! They deliver the money after lunch. What? They deliver the money after lunch! What? There's a problem. Shoot. We have to kill the guards. Is that a problem? What's the problem? Est bien! I'll kill the guard. The guards. There are two. Est bien! I'll kill both of them! I like Victoria. "Rob the bank"... Est bien! "Kill the guards," est bien! - Suck my dick. - Est muy bien! Nature sucks! What was that? What did you say? Everyone hates everyone. What sucks? Nature! A lioness eating a zebra! A zebra? You're clueless! I know a zebra when I see one. And that's a big one! Zebra world champion! And he still gets eaten! Fuck it! Zebras are people too! Get some real girls here! Real or fake, what's the difference? Sonia says she sucked you faggots off! What did she say? I'll bash her teeth in! Easy does it... You have a girl. Why complain? No guy ever sucked me off! Sometimes a mouth is a mouth! Fuck... is he going to make us wait forever? He won't show up. Yes, he will. He's not crazy. He gave me my first gun. I was still a baby. Yeah, but... he's my Uncle Joe. Let's go... I smell cops all over. Don't be paranoid! Everywhere we go, you smell cops! This time I know it. It's scary! Let's go! Come on! What are you waiting for? Get off! What are you, blind? Fuck you! I'm deaf, not blind! Thanks... I know. What? Headquarters to Luna 1. Luna 1 here. I have City Hall on line one. They're furious. You shut it off? Once I nab Dobermann, the Commissioner will kiss my ass. What's this thing? If cops come, the sirens go off. Hide your guns under the couch. He's crazy! Why would I hide my gun for cops? Come and get me! Hey there, Mosquito! So, girls, next week I'm off to... New York. And when I come back I'll have a pretty little pussy and a huge clitoris! Shit, it's him! My God! We've got him! Shut up! You'll wake the kid. The Commissioner has to be alerted! You want the Air Force too? Listen, Christini, I've seen what those fuckers do with guns. I'm calling headquarters! Shut up. Dumb fuck. You had your chance. You shit your pants and got men killed. Don't make me angry. Thugs are like wild game. Meat has to rot a little to be good. Let them have a drink. And another... A joint, a fix, a line or two... Let them have some fun. Get nice and wasted. We'll scoop them up at the exit, one by one, like ugly, overripe berries. In the cartridges? When I get busted, they never check. Good thinking! Teddy bear, try this... It'll blow your mind. Take off the cap! What for? Yeah, what for? Take off! What are you doing? "Wild Kingdom"... My favorite! Teddy Bear, do you like me? You make me a woman. You're handsome... The way you look at me kills me. What's wrong, Teddy? You're having a bad trip. Take some of this. You're scaring me. It stinks. Only a low-life would cut the cheese in a car. It's the baby. It stinks. Go change him. What's wrong? Some guy with a gun is jerking off. I'm paid to dance, not to see that shit. It's Manu. I mean it... Everyone will start. Go dance. I'll handle it... I mean it... Happy birthday, Sonia. Have fun. Yann! Thanks. Sit down and stay there. They don't fuck, they don't suck. I can't even beat my meat! What do I do? Fuck myself? Stop with that shit! He's crazy! My stuff! What's wrong? I have to take a dump. A major shit. Occupied! When I can't shoot my wad, I need to shit. It's a reflex. Go outside. Use Mother Nature. Fuck, Mother Nature! She can eat my shit and die! No time like the present. You'll see what I do to Mother Nature! What a bunch of wackos! How can you work with them? They're the best. I'll dump my load! He better not come piss on us. Who is he? I don't know, but he's totally wasted. He's not pissing. What's he doing? Shitting. What the fuck? The baby! Stop! Police! She wasn't tied up? Come here. It's over now. Bastard! Fuck! Kill those cop killers! Yann! Hurry! They shot my dick! Everyone down! Out of the way! Hear that? Cop scum! I can't see! Fuck! The cartridges! Faggot! Move in! Let's fuck them all! I'll call headquarters. No, this way! We're almost there. - Dobermann? - Not a trace. No music? - Where's the music? - Get up, asshole! Your brains splattered on the walls. Stop it! Cold shower time! Haul her ass out of here! Get moving! We've bagged Mosquito with Panther Lady. Enjoy it! O God, we praise you. O Lord, we glorify you. And you, poor... Cut the crap! The quarry, my son. Hunters everywhere. What were you doing behind the mirror? Spying? The ingratitude of youth, the hypocrisy of sinners... We made it. It's a service tunnel. It leads up to the parking lot. We'll sit it out here. We can stay two weeks. Two weeks? I want to go find my dick! What are they for? Security? Just for perving. They'll lead them here. Invisible... The walls were built around the system. Camouflaged and sound-proof. Great idea! Fuck! Go easy. I'm almost out of ammo. - Know a good prayer? - It won't do. - Say it anyway. - What the fuck? I have a hostage! Stop shooting! Please! Don't shoot! Here we come! He's crazy! Drop your guns! They're together! The Lord is with us and His power is immense... Stop praying. Get in. Come on, let's go. It's Inspector Baumann... What about him? - They blew his face off. - Okay, okay... You're beautiful, Sonia. Kiss me. I need my tracer. Get rid of this rat. I knew you were just a bitch! No, it's not true... When you die, I'll paint swastikas on your tomb. Do your decorating later. Take them upstairs for now. I'll make their tattoos talk. Everyone was arrested but you. You know the rule... Tell Yann... it was for my baby. Let's go. We have to move you. I'm not dying. I don't care about my dick. I was talking crap. We can't go to jail for a piece of cock. You're pissing blood, Manu. Change the subject. Come closer. Screaming is killing me. Remember our first hold-up? The post office, Rue Duc. Yeah? We were in the street... And? I was going to surrender. You opened fire. What did I do? You opened fire on those motherfuckers. - Those sons of... - Bitches. And you said... What did I say? What did I say? You said: "Never get had by those assholes. "They're slower and pack less heat." Don't hand me over to them... Manu! He's out of it. Look! It's Nat and Pitbull. Jacky Sweat, alias Pitbull. Yann Le Pantrec, the Dobermann... A kennel, not a gang! Jean-Claude Ayache, Mosquito! Elie Frossart, the Abbot! Sound familiar? Maybe. What team are they on? What sport? We have pictures of you and Dobermann. I do autographs. Isn't this the sign of your sick group? You all have it! I like dogs. This dope means 15 years. More, David. A lot more. Policemen died. Family men. I came for a birthday. Go ask my friend Sonia. You don't know her either? Same tattoo and you don't know her? You know Dobermann! He's your man. Dumb bitch! Dob walks but you'll be getting life! Life is long when you start young. Very long. When you're alone. Crazy world! He won't jerk off to your photo for life! Four what? I understand. What? 4 fingers up your ass! Bitch! It's over! You're alone now! Where's your gang of losers? There's no one left but you two lumps of shit. Fuckers... Sorry, David. Save the dry cleaner's bill. He should be locked up! That one! Fuck, Manu.. I don't believe it. Wait! The cops are everywhere. - Stay with Manu! - Wait till tomorrow! Don't let them take him! - Stop! - Beat it! You're insane! Beat it! Get lost! Piece of shit! You're not going to jail yet. First I'm fucking you! You hear me? You can't hear a thing, but you'll feel my cock! You'll feel my cock! I'll fuck Dob's bitch! There you are, faggot! I've got you! I'll fuck you! You'll fuck me? Free shave! For Leo! For Pitbull! For Manu! Alive... I'm alive. Lord... our life is short and fragile, as this death reminds us. But You are forever alive and Your love is stronger than death. We give You our brother... We give You our sister who has left us. Forgive her her faults and let her live beside You, through Jesus Christ, our Lord... It was a pretty shady ceremony. Sonia, you want to do it again for real?
