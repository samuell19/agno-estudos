(MultiCom jingle) (clock ticking) (dramatic music) (playful music) (clocks ticking) (dramatic music) - He who will not learn the lessons of time. Is doomed to repeat them. (cheerful music) (children chattering) - You ever listen to that door? Old Man Markham must have around a million clocks in there. He doesn't sell them. So what's he do with all them clocks? - I don't know, and I don't wanna know. It's creepy the way he seems to know what everybody says. Or sometimes, even before they say it. - Hey, Devon! You wanna pitch some pennies with me? I'll throw from 10 feet back. - Sure. Not! - How about you, Henry? I'll throw from 20. - Mary Beth, you can pitch pennies from outer space so that they burn up in the Earth's atmosphere before even reaching the pavement, and I still wouldn't pitch pennies with you. - Boy, are there any true sportsmen around here? - [Both] No. - You wanna know what I think? - No. - I think he's got this place bugged. - Bugged? - Yeah, bugged. I'm talking microphones, and maybe them teeny little video cameras like they use in them cop movies. That's why he knows all about us all the time. - Devon, gotta tell ya. When you look at it from all sides, the money he had to spend, I gotta tell ya again, it just doesn't seem all that likely. - By the way, Henry, I, uh, agree with you completely. - Agree with me about what, Mister Markham? - Well, it's just utterly preposterous that I would have bugged the whole house, installed cameras and microphones. And look at this, Henry. You've got this lead soldered in the wrong place. Look at the book. Let me ask you a question, Henry Watkins. If we take time, and we fold it in upon itself, and then unfold it, what happens to the wrinkles, hmm? Are we at the end, Henry? Or the beginning? Hmm? Chickens. Eggs. Chickens. Eggs. (twinkling) - [Devon] Shh! - Just what do you think you're doing? - Look, Henry. I say he's got this place bugged. You say no. I'm gonna find out. (mysterious music) - Come on, Henry. It sounds like fun. - [Henry] I don't need this. - Come on, Henry. You wanna know what old Markham's got in his room, same as me. - No, I don't! - Maybe even more than me. You're the one that wants to know everything. Because sometimes, Henry, sometimes when you wanna get to the other side of something, there's no safe way across. You just gotta jump, man! Look, Henry. You stay or you go. But don't kid yourself. If you stay, it's not because you're smart. It's because you are a chicken. (imitating chicken) - [Mary Beth] Henry! Don't close the door. - All right all right! I'll go. But don't think I don't know that you're manipulating me. - I don't even know what that means. (mysterious music) - [Mary Beth] Look. - [Henry] Hey, Devon, no! What if he's got some kind of an alarm or something? - Then I'll drop the key, and we'll run like hamsters. (lock turns) - [Mary Beth] What was that? (alarm blaring) - [Devon] Let's go. - Guys, I don't know about this. Dang it, Devon, wait up. (bell chimes) (door slams) - [Devon] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - [Henry] What happened? - The door closed. Quick, somebody find a light! - [Devon] Huh. - Freeze. (whirring and clanging) Down! (intense music) - Whoa! That can't possibly be legal. - Devon, as of now, my curiosity is 100% satisfied. - Might be time for strategic withdrawal. - [Devon] I think you might be right. - I'll race you. - [All] Whoa! - Sometimes, you just gotta jump! Man, this is the last time I'm ever listening to you, Devon. Come on, Mary Beth! Mary Beth! - [Devon] Look out! Look out! (loud whirring) Come on! - Henry, look out! - Help me! - [Devon] We got ya! (knocking) Well. That wasn't so bad, was it? - [Henry] This was a total disaster. (door slams) - What? Are you back again? Hey, why don't you do us some good and light this place up so we can see where we are? Thank you. (mysterious music and ticking) Wow. Look at all these clocks. - It doesn't make any sense. A setup like that for a bunch of clocks? - [Devon] Hey, this one's not even set right. - Hey, don't touch that! - What? - They're supposed to be different times. Look at the labels on the clocks. They're here to tell the time all over the world. You see, there's Moorpark, California. Long Beach, California. Beijing, China. Bucharest, Romania. - It all sort of comes together in this gadget. - Maybe it's some sort of master clock. You know, like they talk about? An atomic clock? - I wonder what's inside. (mechanical humming) Aww, nothing! (alarm blares) (mechanical whirring) - I think it's him. I think it's Mister Markham. - [Devon] Oh, no. - [Henry] What now? - Okay. Hide! Oh, no, you don't. This is mine! Get out, get out, get out! - [Mary Beth] Guys? - [Devon] Get out, get out, get out! - [Mary Beth] Guys? - [Henry] Devon! Devon! Devon, come on out! - Can I go here? - [Henry] Devon! - Henry. - [Henry] Devon, come out, Devon! - Henry! Shh, look. I have the key. He's gone. - Thank God. Now let's go before he gets back. And I'm telling you, I'm never jumping anywhere again. Devon, come on out. - Come on out, Devon. Devon? - [Henry] There, press that pedal to open it up. And then there. (mechanical humming) Where is he? - How should I know? My book's gone, too. You know, he must have, like, a trick wall or something. - Trick wall? - Yeah, why not? Considering everything else. Okay, he didn't come out through the front, and he's not in here now. So he must have come out some other way. - Maybe poor Devon's dropped down into the basement or something. - Yeah, so maybe we should go and get some help. - Yeah. Okay, come on! (buzzing) - What the heck? - Henry, what's going on? - I don't know. - Where are we? - We just... I don't know. Come on. (knocking) - Yeah? - [Henry] Hi, I'm looking for the Laverto resident apartment building that's at 98? - It's right here. Now get lost. - Henry, what is going on? Where is everybody? We were just at Mister Markham's. What's going on? That's my apartment. - And that's mine. - Mom, dad? Where are you? - See? Henry, look. That crack in the plaster. I know it. I used to imagine it was a map of the Mississippi. And it's here. Henry, did we do this? - I think I wanna get out of here. I wanna get out of this place. - Me, too. (mechanical humming) (dramatic music) Hey, Henry, maybe we can call someone. - Who? - Anyone. - [Voiceover] Welcome to Brogan Savings and Loan automatic banking center. Please state your name. - It's weird. Sort of like an ATM thing. Look, Brogan. Just like on the building. - And it's there, too. - Henry! (car honks) - Jeez! - Gosh, that thing hardly made a sound. - Hmm, it's electric. Jeez. Brogan Bankwell Department Store. Established on this site in nine. - 1903. But that's impossible. This wasn't here an hour ago. None of this was. - Or maybe it was, and we weren't. - I don't understand. - Well, I think I'm starting to. - [Voiceover] Hey, you two. Hold it right there. (engine sputtering) - [Voiceover] Let's see your ID cards. - Excuse me, our what? - Don't play dumb. We wanna see your ID. - ID? We don't have any. - Um, well, I have a library card. - What's this supposed to be? - It's, um, it's a library card. - Trying to be funny or something? Um, I don't think so. - Alright, no ID. Where's your residence? - Uh, back there, at the Laverto. - Me, too. - Okay, Henry Watkins. And what's your name? - [Mary Beth] Mary Beth Grace. - Uh huh. Well, here's a surprise. No listing at the Laverto. No listing in the directory at all. - We're not lying. - [Officer] Well, why don't you take us over there? Let us speak to your parents. - We can't. They're not there. - You don't say. Show us you have the keycard for the front door. - We don't have that, either. - Isn't that terrible? Nobody's home, and they haven't got a key. Shocking how kids are treated these days. All right, hands up against the vehicle, slugs. - Hey, let go of him! - [Officer] You heard him, boy! Hands on your feet! - What did we do? - [Officer] Don't fuss with me. - Yeah? Well, fuss with this! (zapping) - Right. Metal. (screaming) - Don't move, don't move! Static electricity. Electricity units, they're more stronger if you struggle. Don't move. - Take a look at the fellow next to me. That thing in his neck. - Oh, yeah, I've seen a bunch of people with those. Bioelectric implants. - Huh? - This place is full of all that future stuff. Wall screens. Bio implants. Cardkeys. Electric cars that really work. - Henry, are you saying that we're in the future? - That doesn't explain the plaque on the department store established in 1903. Uh, excuse me, mister. Do you know the date? - [Voiceover] Huh? August 25. - Well, that's today. - [Henry] What's the year? - The year? 1998. What did you think? - That's what I thought. Thanks a lot. - Henry, what's going on? - Time. Time and the Clockmaker. (beeping) - Watkins and Grace? - Yeah? - [Voiceover] Let's go, move it. - [Voiceover] Move it. (dramatic music) (electricity crackling) - [Voiceover] Extend your wrists. This doesn't hurt. - [Mary Beth] Ow! (mechanical whirring) - All right. In a moment, we'll know who you two really are, unless you wanna save some time and tell me the truth. - We already told those weirdos. - Henry! We have nothing to say. - You're already in violation of Section Seven, vagrancy. Section Two, failure to carry state and federal identification. And Section Nine, making false statements to an officer of the vagrancy police. I think we all know where you two are going. - Where's that? - Shh. Shut up. - Go on boy, listen to your little lawyer friend, don't let it matter to you that things will go easier if you cooperate. Now, for the final time, what is your real name? - I have nothing to say. - Fine. It doesn't matter to me. Failure to cooperate with an officer of the Vagrancy Police. That will be just another charge on your screen. Ah, here we go. The mystery is now solved. Well, it doesn't make any sense. There's gotta be something wrong, everybody's in the system, everybody. Hmm. You two stay where you are. We're going to find out what this is all about. (intense music) - [Voiceover] I feel a little generous. This really sucks. I didn't agree to this. Hey, let go of me. You're not getting away with this. Let go of me. You guys are crazy. My dad works for the CIA when he finds out about this. Oh please be gentle. Ow! We haven't even. Ow, let me out of here! - [Voiceover] Shut up! - [Voiceover] Come on, let me out! - You're certain we can figure out this book? - No certain but count on it. - Well I rely on you as always, Mr. Bankwell. - Know what you're always great for, Mr. Brogan. - Good. (Brogan laughing) (knocking) - You tried that 20 times. - Well I don't hear any better ideas coming from your direction. (door opening) - Hmm. Now, your uncle is here to pick you up. In the future, carry your cards with you. Mr. Markham. - Children, oh, I have been so worried. Where have you been? - [Voiceover] Mr. Markham. - Silence is golden Henry. - Mr. Markham. - With your streets of years inside. Let's go, come on out, let's go, come on out out out out inside now, come on, come on. Hurry hurry up. Scram let's go. A fairer and foul in day I have not seen. - Oh yeah, well it's been a real bummer day for us too. - Now what in the world did I... Oh. My key please. Thank you. (mechanical whirring) (curious music) (door slamming) Light! Neat trick huh? Come on! Three, two, one. Light. Henry. Mary Beth. Seat yourselves, you're in the Hall of Time. - [Voiceover] Just tell me Mr. Markham. - Quiet Henry, every tick tock clock you see in here is not just a timepiece but a regulator of time, somewhere on the earth these wires are connected to a part of this breathing earth, past time, future time, present time, always on time, Waukegan! You're behind again. Come on Waukegan, keep up keep up keep up. Come on Waukegan, keep up keep up keep up. - [Voiceover] See, it's true, it's a time machine. - Time machine is right Henry. It's a time machine, time is infinite, and time is finite. Time regulates us, or we regulate time. Devon busted up the continuum by reentering time. Civilization invents time travel 150 years before they ought to. According to my calculations which I do it just had a little gadget right here. This full continuum, self destruction, exactly three days, 22 hours, and 41 minutes. - And this is all because of Devon? - Him and you. - But I don't get it. Devon doesn't even know which end of a light bulb to fix into the lock, I mean, how would he have done all this? - I know, the book, my book. It had designs of vacuum tubes, basic electronics, basic computer repairs. And I guess somebody with enough know how got his greedy little hands on it. - That's right he did. That's just what we've gotta fix. We've got to do it in less than four days, otherwise this whole continuum from the beginning of time to the end to now, you me everything, ka-blooie. Ka-blooie-, bam, whiz. - Well how are we supposed to do that? - Maybe go back in time. You'll travel backwards, you go back, you can track him down. You catch him, before he busts up the continuum by giving that book to somebody. That's the way you do it. - What do you mean, we? We track him down? - Exactly. - So then we know where, I mean, when he is? - Come here look at this. (clocks ticking) By pure intuition I can send you back there, I can get you close, but unfortunately Devon did not set the coordinates before he left. But we can get close, close to where close to when, but not precisely that's up to you. Clear? - No. - No. - Now hold on a second Mr. Clockmaker, look, I'm not saying we're not partially responsible. - Good. - 'Cause we are, I mean don't get me wrong. But if this whole thing is so important, if this whole time continue whatever. - Um um um. - Continuum. - Yes. - Is gonna go. - Ka-blooie. - Ka-blooie, right. Then, you know, why can't you do it? I mean qualification-wise and everything we're just kids. - Yeah. - I know, you'd like me to clean up your messes for you and well I won't do it. You broke it, you fix it. Come on children, let's go, quickly quickly. - Now? - Begin the adventure of your lives, let's go, oh. - Wait a minute, we can't just go, we need a plan. - Oh we're gonna send you back. - Work out the-- - All right! Children in you go, quick quick quick. (door slamming) You understand I'm not an independent contractor. Much as I might like to I've got bosses to answer to, I can't tell you any more than I already have otherwise it'd mess things up worse than they are already. - Well that's hard to believe. - [Mr. Markham] Believe it honey. Now Henry, pay attention. - I'm paying attention, I'm listening. - I'm gonna send you back to 1880 right? Now you look on the side wall there there's a red knob and there's a green one next to it and a black one, the black one sends you through, the green one sets the time, the red one the place, you got it? - No. I don't understand. - Oh that's all right, it's not important you will, that's what is important. All right, good luck to you. - Hey hey now, wait a second! Is that it? - Yeah I mean, can you give us some ray guns or something? - Not allowed, not allowed. - Or how about some 1880 money? - Yeah, that could come in handy. - 1880 no we can't do that that'd be temporal counterfeiting I'm sorry. Now look, kids, all jokes aside, everything depends on you, everybody everywhere. You cannot fail. You understand? - Yes. I understand. - Good luck to you. (hatch slamming) (intense music) - Okay, here goes nothing. Red sets the place, green sets the time, black sends you through. (clock ticking) Oh hey wait! We don't know how to get back! (loud phasing) Look out! - [Voiceover] Get out of the way! (dog barking) (man singing and grumbling) (speaking French) - Shove off you old drunk. - Oh she is a little wild cat. - Mary Beth this is a very serious situation, we need a plan of action now. Hey wait, where you going? - This way. - [Henry] Why? - You want a plan of action? We need to find Devon right? - Right. - And we only have four days to do it in, right? - Well actually three days, 22 hours, 13 minutes, and 42 seconds. - Was he back there poindexter? - [Henry] No. - Fine, so that's why I'm looking for him down here. Devon! Come out so I can kill you. Devon. See? I'm looking for him. Devon! Where are you Devon? Devon! (loud buzzing) (dramatic music) - Check for traces. (machine beeping) - Sir. We have a trace here. - Could it be one of ours? - No sir. The signature is all wrong. It's them. - Check your weapons. These are our targets. I am sure you'll do whatever is necessary. Let's move out. (beeping) - Devon! Yo, Devon! - [Voiceover] Devon. - [Mary Beth] Where are you? Devon! - [Voiceover] Devon. - Devon! (clock bell striking) Three AM? No wonder why there's so many creeps out. - [Voiceover] Yeah, so quit yelling like that. - Oh don't worry Henry, I'll protect you. Ha. (Henry laughing) - Yeah right. See, the thing is, Devon would've been worse off than us. He was all alone on these dark streets. - I know, poor Devon. - What would he have done? Where would he have gone? Could try to find help but from who? - From us maybe? - Uh uh, all he has was that book of mine. Once he realized he was back in time, he would've tried to turn it into money. - Speaking of such, we could use a little money ourselves right about now. I haven't eaten since breakfast. - Yeah and that was two whole continuums ago. - Yeah. - [Henry] What's that? - A penny. (women laughing) Watch this. (speaking French) - [Voiceover] You linger jinxing me. - Mind if I have a throw? - Go on. Go on and play hopscotch or something. - [Voiceover] No Jimmy. - Don't you go crying when I take that penny okay? - I swear I won't. Go on and toss. (machines beeping) - [Voiceover] Sir. (footsteps tapping) - Scan it. (machine beeping) - No traces sir. Not recent. - No, but it's from him. Search the outside of this warehouse, take the right, you the left, I'm going in, full spectrum check for traces. Meet you again on Cinnamon Street, go. - Well we're not gonna starve Henry, I won two dollars. Isn't that like 100 bucks or something in this time? - Mary Beth. - What Henry? - Do you think they had blue chalk back in 1880? Help me here. (creaking) - What is it? - Do you see it Mary Beth? That's blue chalk, Devon left his mark here. - It's almost worn away. - Come on, let's see if we can find another. Let's try down there. (women cackling) - I don't like this. It's so dark. I wish we had a flashlight. - [Henry] Presto, your wish is my command. - Thanks Henry. - Oh Mary Beth look. See it points that way, let's go. (old time music) - There now go on home before you make me forget I'm a lady. Now is anyone else looking for a fight? (tense music) - Lead us to a dead end and then you can bother to erase the arrow. - All right all right, the point is, he was here. Maybe weeks ago, but still he was here, and that means we can find him. We'll just have to keep circling around until we pick up his trail again. Excuse us. What the heck? - [Voiceover] God bless Rutherford B. Hayes. (lasers firing) (drowned out by lasers) (board thudding) - Hey hey, what's all this? - [Henry] Look out! - Hey oh, down for the count. Now suppose you two tell me just what's going on around here. - Well, it's a very long story. - Others like them looking for us. - We can go up to my place, it's just upstairs, come on then. - Those guys from last night, they're out there. - Well whatever technology they've got, it doesn't look like they can home in on us, or Devon. - [Mary Beth] Mm. - Girl, make yourself useful and go cut some bread. (knife scraping) Thank you. - You're welcome. (laser effects) - Mary Beth. Wow. They must be built to do that when the user loses it. Must keep technology from falling in the wrong hands. - Girl, go get the bowls. - Sure. (gentle music) Henry who are they, and why are they chasing us? - I'm a bit puzzled about that myself Poly. - Poly? My name is Mary Beth. - Oh, then Poly's gonna be a bit upset when she finds out you're wearing her vest. - Poly. - Well, I can read you know, I finished the third grade, it says right there Poly Ester. - That's polyester, that's the stuff the vest is made of. - Oh, well if that's your story, I ain't gonna argue. You know last week, I bought me a dress made of Ellen McCormick. Fits me rather well. Oh, you need to eat. Eat up. - Do you have any ketchup? - Root. - Woo hoo, cholesterol heaven. - Thank you. - I know who they are. They're time agents. They come from the future, this future. The future of the world that Devon mucked up. The one that invented time travel 150 years too early. - Why are they after us? - Isn't it obvious? - No. - Devon got sent back in time to 1880, when he did, he changed the future. Our world, the one that we're born and disappeared, if we find Devon and stop him, then things go back to being the way they were. And our future comes back online, and their future, the one with those time agents, disappears. They are never born. And that's what they're here for, to keep us from finding Devon, and from stopping their future from coming into existence. Simple. - Can you run that by me again? - Look miss. - Name is Brick Top Betty. - [Mary Beth] Brick Top? - On account of my beautiful red hair, but you can call me Betty. Betty Callahan. - Look Betty, you saved our lives and there's no way we can ever thank you enough. It's too complicated to explain. A friend of ours came into this city a while ago, we need to find him. Those men are here to keep us from doing it. They'll kill us if they have to. Because, whether or not we find our friend it's life or death. - Where do we start lookin'? - [Voiceover] Good morning. (giggling) - The question isn't where, the question is how. - Rags! Any more rags please? A penny for your rags please? Rags. Rags please. Any old rags? Rags please? Rags? A penny for your rags please? Rags. Any old rags? Oh, thank you my darling. Open up puppy boy. I said puppy boy, open open open. - Henry! Henry! - Shh. (curious music) (wood clattering) - [Voiceover] Sorry! - That's right you're sorry! Why you talked me into taking care of you don't work the field right. - Did he make us? - Did he make us what? - You think he recognized us? - Yes, they're watching us if that what you mean. (machine beeping) (intense music) (breathing heavily) - This one looks newer. There isn't an order to it, 'cause he was just walking around. Sometimes he drew arrows, sometimes he didn't. Sometimes they point one way, sometimes they point the other. - Isn't this just like Devon? He leaves us clues we can't even tell what they mean. - Well he never finished signing it. - Then he was interrupted. - No, he stopped here. Something happened, he met somebody or saw something that made him stop. - Maybe the heat? - [Betty] Ah it hasn't been that hot. - No no I mean the police. - The bulls, oh no not on this block. - So then who did he meet? Or what did he see? He had the book and by this time he would've gotten the idea to sell it, but who would he have sold it to? Who would have understood? - Henry. - What? (tense music) Tuldine Machine Works. - Brogan Industries, Brogan Savings and Loan. - Brogan Bank Wear Department Store. He was here. He saw the machine works, that's where he would've gone to. In 100 years from now, Brogan's name will still be all over the place. Betty, do you know this guy? This Brogan? - Certainly, I have dinner with him all the time. - Really? - Oh no sonny, not really. I've never met a man whose name was painted up so big. And I'm not likely to. - He's the one that Devon would've gone to right? But how long ago? A month, a day? - [Betty] Work it out later. (intense music) - [Henry] What the? - [Betty] Down the hatch, you too! (Henry shouting) (squishing) - Boy somebody must really like his barbecues. - Kid, watch your language, now all the cellars on this block are connected up. When we get home, you two are gonna give me some plain answers. Now come on. (footsteps tapping) - Coast is clear. - Turn on the light darlin'. - [Voiceover] Well where's the switch? - Use your noggin, they didn't have electricity back in 1880. - I guess you two ain't used to modern convenience. (match lighting) (curious music) - Hey Betty, if you wanna see modern conveniences, ha. - I'm listening. - [Henry] See, there's this guy, he lives on the third floor of our apartment building. We thought he was real creepy, but actually he works very hard to keep the whole world, past, present, future, on time. Then, Devon, Mary Beth, and I sort of messed it all up. - The thing is we only have three days to find Devon. And if we don't. - [Henry] Ka-blooie. - That means-- - Oh I think I understand the meaning of ka-blooie. Oh, this is one strange kettle of fish. - You said it. - So, what's the plan? - The trouble is that the time agents have to know where Devon was taken. I mean their whole universe is descended from Brogan and Bankwell. They'll be searching the place, and they'll be looking for us. What we need is, what we really need is is to be invisible. - Invisible. I think I know the next best thing. (tense music) (door creaking open) - Hey, hey out there. Let me out! Let me out I'll make you rich. I swear I can. Oh come on now talk to me! You can't keep me in here you hear me? This is kidnapping. You tell Brogan this wasn't part of our deal, you hear me? I want my share! You at least let me out. Oh come on now. Hey! At least give me more than one meal a day. Shoot. - This way, watch your head. Okay now Mr. Brogan, I want you to notice these measuring devices, especially this one and the one on top. Now, what I'm gonna do is allow a small amount of current into here and see right here? This is where the smaller current regulates the flow of the large current. You understand? This, uh... This vacuum, it's an electrical one. - How long will it take you to finish all 5,000 of them? - As far as you can see construction a little while, but Mr. Brogan, come here. I wanna show you something. The possibilities suggested by Mr. Vice alone will almost never miss. This is a magnificent chain. What I'd like to do is speak with young Master Devon one more time. - No, he can't tell you anything more. - Oh no no no, don't be so sure Mr. Brogan sir. Sometimes it only takes a little hint. Knowing that something's possible can make all the difference in the world. - We've got enough craw dance doing for now Bankwell. The boy isn't going anywhere. Build me my computer. Then, you can talk to him. (footsteps tapping) (distant machines clanking) - You. - Yes sir? - When did we hire you? - Yesterday sir. - Well you're dismissed. - Sorry, sorry sir. (footsteps tapping) - Any sign of those time goons? - No not a one. It's weird. (door creaking) - Hey! They have him all right. I heard them talk about him. - [Henry] Do they know where he is? - They didn't say. And then that walking weed Mr. Bankwell gave me the boot. - He fired you? - Don't worry sonny, I pinched the keys. - We can sneak in tonight! - I wouldn't want to be the one to do that, they let the dogs loose in there at night. - Brogan knows where he is. And so does that other guy Bankwell. Betty, do you know where they throw out the paper trash? The ones from their offices. - Mm, around the side. - Do they take the trash out daily? - [Betty] Of course. - Show us. (curious music) What should I do? - Henry, what are you looking for, exactly? - [Henry] Something with Brogan's signature on it. - Here's something. - Oh no no no no no, you see it's dictate, that's a secretary's handwriting, we need something with his. - Right right right. (papers rustling) - Oh I see that. There that's it. That's his signature, now alls we need to do is get the same kind of paper. Now come on let's go. (curious music) How about this one? - Better. Not there yet. You're not a half bad forger. - I've got all sorts of hidden talents. - Here comes the big man now. We're taking a risk if somebody's watching us. - I know, but what can I do? We have to take that risk, today's the day, it's the last day. Are you sure I look all right? - You'll do. - Let's just give 'em one more minute. We all know the plan right? - What there is of one. You're on Henry. - Okay I'm going in. See ya. - Be careful Henry. - You and me, around the back. Don't forget your weapons. - Armed and dangerous. - Cheers. (bell ringing) - [Henry] Hi, I got a message for Mr. Bankwell. - Give it to me. - Can't, Mr. Brogan said that I am to deliver it to him personally, and then wait for his answer. - Mr. Brogan. - Yes sir, I'm supposed to get the answer then take a cab to his club and that's at-- - All right all right hold on. Oh, Mr. Bankwell. This young man has a message for you from Mr. Brogan. - [Voiceover] Oh really? - [Secretary] Yes sir. - [Voiceover] I just saw him a half an hour ago. - He went out a short time ago. - All right let me see it. - The gentleman said that you're to read it in private, and that I'm not to leave your sight until I get the answer. He's real clear about that sir. - All right you come with me, and you you numb skull, no diddle daddling around like before. Go straight to the workshop. (snapping) Come on. (footsteps shuffling) (machine beeping) Right this way. Hold up. Take this down to my office right now. Replacement. All right, this is good, letter? (tense music) Bankwell, take the book and go to the canned up boy at once, ask him about software, important, write down his reply, send it to me by way of this messenger he's not to leave your side until he has a reply. I have to meet him below. And boy, I want you to tell me, who gave you this letter? - Oh, Mr. Brogan sir. - Ah. And, what'd he look like? - Around this high sir, dressed nice, a little on the plump side and nice little mustache and kind of a nice red flower on his button. - Ah all right, follow me. But I want you to listen very very closely, you're not to speak to anyone about what you're gonna see, understand me boy? - Oh yes sir, Mr. Brogan already went over that with me. - [Mr. Bankwell] All right this way. (tense music) (tools banging) Right this way. - You're right, being a wash woman is just like being invisible. - Yes. Unless somebody slips on the soap. Come on, let's go. - To the left, put your head on right. Okay this way, tell him this way. Come on. Come on you stupid little boy. Driving me insane. Wait a second boy, wait. (man snoring) Can I get you a pillow? - Sorry, sorry Mr. Bankwell, sorry I must have just dozed off for a second. - [Mr. Bankwell] I see. - Never happened before sir. - Oh look, here's the problem right here. I mean you see this chair's a little too comfortable for you! You can stand and watch from now on. Come on. (door creaking) Here come on. You, stay right there. (door creaking) All right get up. Sit at the table Master Devon. - Get bent. - Oh dear. We're not gonna have to start refusing you food and water again are we? (match lighting) Master Devon, I want you to tell me everything. Everything you know about software. - Okay. Um. Well, it's in a computer you know. Like games and stuff. You see? It's kind of like what makes it go. Sort of. Like Windows and Macs and Nintendos and all that. - Uh hold on. Let's take it from the beginning again shall we? Now, where exactly are the windows? (suspenseful music) - What is it? What do you want? What's wrong, can't you talk? What do you want? I said what do you ah! (knocking) - Yes? What is it? (door creaking) You. What the devil are you doing here? - This. (Mr. Bankwell shouting) - [Devon] This. - [Mr. Bankwell] Oh no, ah! Ow! (Devon shouting) - Come on. - Come on! Devon! Come on! Come on Devon. - [Betty] The book. - Well it took you long enough. - Yeah, well it was your fault in the first place, you're the one who wrecked the continuum. - I wrecked the who? - Can we just please talk about this later? Come on, come on. - Children! Children! - [Betty] Come on, come on. - [Mr. Bankwell] Children come back here! Children. (intense music) (machines clanging) - [Henry] Oh the book! - [Mary Beth] Get it! (intense music) - Which way now? - Oh these brats need to run back, and I'm taking 'em to Mr. Bankwell. - It's them! (guns beeping) With the child this way! - Those guys have ray guns. - [Henry] No kidding let's go! - Mr. Brogan, the boy in the basement. - [Voiceover] What? - He's free, and they have the book. - What do you know about the book? - [Man] Mr. Bankwell sent me. - [Mr. Brogan] Go on, go get help! - [Voiceover] Yes sir. - Don't let them out of the building. Nobody, and I mean it. - Yes. - [Mr. Brogan] Nobody! (intense music) - We can go that way. What are you looking for? - Yeah, let's go Henry. I'm not spending the rest of my life in a cell. - [Henry] Giant vacuums. - You know we risked our lives to come back and save you. - [Henry] Nah, couldn't be. - Well, you haven't done it yet. - Look. - [Betty] What is it? - It's the computer. Devon how long? How long ago did you come through? - Um, about three months. - Then it's almost finished. - Henry let's just get out of here, we will come back and blow it up or something. - That wouldn't help, we're too late. Rescuing Devon even taking the book it's too late. We can't take the knowledge out of their heads. Even if we wrecked it they'd just build it again. We need a plan, need a plan. - We'll make a plan later but now we've got to go, let's go! (intense music) (guns beeping) - Everybody hurry up, get out of here! - [Devon] Who the heck are those guys? - [Mary Beth] Explain later. - [Devon] They have ray guns too! - Tip the barrel. Come on, push! - What do you think I'm trying to do? - Be careful, be careful! (boys grunting) - Oh my, you're a good girl. (lasers firing) (portals hissing) Ready for a climb. - Oh, you can climb? - You are just like my dearest Tommy Grace. He's a midshipman. - What'd you say his name was? - Tommy Grace. - You're my great great great great grandmother. (lasers firing) (intense music) (Henry gasps) - Who'd you say these guys were again? - Crystallize the one in front but don't harm the other, he must be recaptured by Brogan. - Get back you! - Get down! (men screaming) Oh man, that took some nerve standing in front of me. - That was some pretty good thinking on your part too. - All right man. - [Henry] Oh let's go help Mary Beth. - [Devon] Right. - [Betty] We can't go back down that way! - [Henry] Oh shoot. - [Mary Beth] Henry. - [Henry] Mary Beth, Devon, into the booth now. - [Devon] What? - [Henry] Go on! - [Mary Beth] We can't go, what about Betty? - Go on, go you can! No don't worry, I'm not planning on being no martyr. - [Mary Beth] We'll miss you. (guns beeping) - They're gonna ice us! - [Henry] Not if I can help it. - Hey, stop her! (Betty screaming) Over there, stop her! Stop her now! Stop her for gosh sake! Now! (portals whirring) Who in the devil are you? - Just an interested party Mr. Brogan, please excuse me, let's go. - What? Bankwell! - Great in flight movie. Man I wish I had some popcorn. So where are we exactly? - I don't know. Somewhere in time, somewhere in space. - Well that really narrows it down. - Well boy oh boy this is some kind of rescue. - Ah heck, the point is, I don't know how to work this thing. I just press buttons at random, here pass me that thing right there. Hey look at that. - [Mary Beth] What? - See this black switch right here? It's what Mr. Markham was telling us. This is what he was talking about. Red sets the place, green sets the time, and black sends you through. See that's what he said. Okay here let me just start with the green switch right here. See, I bet that's earth. Yeah and this bumps it up in big chunks. Yeah okay. - [Devon] Where you going? - I got a plan Devon. See, I need to know when you arrived. The date, the time, as close as you can. - I got here 55 days ago exactly. - Okay the time. - I don't know, night. - Okay Devon this is really important, did you look at your watch? - Gee I kinda had other things on my mind. Oh let me think. Well, I was in the basement of that warehouse, I crawled out the window. - A clock, did you hear a clock? - Yeah. Yeah thanks, yeah I heard a clock strike three or four, three of four. - Which one, think! - I'm thinking I'm thinking I don't know. Wait yes I do, yes I do four. Yeah because the sun came up just a little while after that, and I didn't hear a ring any time before. - Okay so it must've been close to three in the morning when you first came through. Okay, so today's the 20th, so 55 days before the 20th, so it was the morning of the 3rd. Oh great, now we need to set the place. - It was at Old Time Street. Yeah, there it is right there, but it was inside. - Right right right. - Yeah, that's better that's it, right there, see it, right there. - Right. - Henry we need a plan. - We got here too late right? What we need to do is try again. We gotta stop Devon from even meeting this Brogan guy. - But I did meet him. - You met him this go around. See we're stopping the next. - Huh? - Henry we only have 20 minutes. If we get there 21 minutes before Devon, only 21 minutes, we'll miss him. - Yeah and if we get there 20 minutes too late, he'll be gone. - Hey, guys, I wish I could be more exact but look, if I knew the entire fate of the world was riding on my shoulders, I would've looked at my watch. - Henry, just set the time, and let's go. - Black's what sends you through. (portal buzzing) - [Mary Beth] Do you know where you came through? - [Devon] Well, somewhere in here. Hey what do you say we split up? - [Mary Beth] Good idea. - [Henry] Okay. Oh hey look at this. Two books. That must mean that there's two-- - I was getting worried. What was that thing anyway, some kind of magic trick box or something? Oh okay, Mary Beth. Say, how do we get out of here, 'cause I've been looking and... God this whole day has just been one big mess of confusion. - Look, this whole thing is real complicated. And we don't have that much time. See the point is that booth you went into-- - Henry hold on. - Mary Beth. - We've got a problem. - Yeah, we only have 13 minutes too. Once we get the books and Devon back in the present, then-- - Look, we've got two Devons. What's gonna happen when we take them both back to the future? - Well that's a good question isn't it? Well, I guess, gee. Well if we take this Devon back to the present then that means he never got caught by Brogan, so then that means this Devon will cease to exist. - Henry. - I'm thinking Mary Beth, I'm thinking. - Henry, look. - [Henry] Come on! - What are those things? I'll tell you just as soon as I find out. (laser firing) - Okay now let's see what happens. - Hey, move over. Hey move over yourself. - No. No! No! (wind howling) - Ah great, you made it. Wonderful. - Yeah well don't get your hopes up we picked up a slight little problem along the way. - What problem? - [Henry] Well open it up. - [Mary Beth] Where is he? - He's gone. - He's outside the continuum, he's been removed by time control. Don't worry about it. - Well how do you know? Where is he? You know he saved my life. - Wait I did? - No no no, not you, the other you. You see, I saved your life, and you I mean he saved mine. - Oh. Okay. - Time is full of many puzzling complexities Devon my boy. All of these time orphans have to be taken out and trained, trained especially. - He's training? - [Mr. Markham] That's right. - Training for what? - For the noblest of all the world's professions, Clockmaker eh? Where do you think we come from? - So let me get this straight. - [Mr. Markham] Yeah. - You're saying that he's gonna take your place or something when you die? - I'm not planning on dying, excuse me very much, but there was an opening in this profession about 60 years ago. - 60 years? - [Mr. Markham] 60 years. - That's a long time. - It is yes. Who do you think the recruited? - Wait a second here. - [Mr. Markham] Yes. - Are you trying to say that you're the other Devon? (laughing) - Hey hey hey guys, hold on just one minute, I'm getting really confused here are you telling me that this is me? This is what I'm gonna look like 60 years from now? - Yes. - Oh no. (laughing) - This does give me a chance to do something I've wanted to do for a long time. Henry Watkins, I want to thank you. Always wanted to thank you for saving my life. - [Henry] Same here, thank you Mr. Markham. - Thanks to all. - [Henry] Same to you. - Henry, kids, wonderful kids. I think we've learned something. Oh, we learned something very very priceless, how much we mean to each other. And how part of the universe we all are. Keep the rules of time and the universe can be a very friendly place.
