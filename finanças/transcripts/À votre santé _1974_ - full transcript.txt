This film was shot in July 1973 in the emergency department of Sacré-Coeur hospital in Montreal. All persons appearing in this film or their legal guardians have given given their written consent. Yes? Yes? Is that all? OK. - I need a file, please. - Yes? - C24-306… - Yes? - 73-12-41… - Yes? - Légaré, Mr André… - Yes? For the emergency department. Last visit: April '73. That's all. OK, thanks. To Your Health - Hello, sir. - Hello. What's wrong? Why are you here? - Well, I'm on vacation… - Yes? And I've got stomach problems. - Your stomach hurts? - Yes. - You've got heart problems? - Yes. Is it your first time here? - Yes. - How old are you? How old? Fifty-three. Fifty… three. - Yes? - Can we get a nurse for heart problems? She's 53. - Heart problems? - Yes. - Are you married? - Yes. - Your wife's maiden name? - Racine. - Her first name? - Monique. - Your father's first name? - Aimé. - Is he still alive? - Yes. - Your mother's maiden name? - Aimée-Rose. - Before she was married? - Uh, Pomerlot. - Hello? - Yes? - Can you send her to room 7? - Room 7? Thanks. You're welcome. I'll keep working on your file. You can go to room 7 now. It's the second door out. Is there anyone else for that? Where did I put my… A nurse at booth 2 for a head injury. Do you have your medical insurance card? Do you have an appointment? No, I don't have an appointment, but he's got a fever. He has measles too, and the flu. When you came here in '73, was it for the same thing? No, it was for pneumonia and laryngitis of the throat. - So it's not for the same thing at all? - Well, now he's wheezing and… Those are not the same symptoms as when you came here in '73? A bit, because he's got a fever. A high fever. It comes and goes. When we went to the hospital, that's also what he had. - He had a fever. - He's got measles now? He's got measles, but it's going away. What's worse is that he's got a fever and the flu at the same time. - Do you have his health insurance card? - No, I don't. Yes, yes. So it was an accident? No, I'm ill and I've been ill before, and my doctor is sending me to this hospital. For something special. You've never been hospital… you've never been here? Yes, yes. I've had surgery here. - I've had surgery. - What's wrong now, exactly? I've got more or less the same symptoms I had when I came. Yes, but what did you have when you came here? My intestines. I had surgery. Do you have your Quebec health insurance card? Yes. Yes, sir? Right. I'm here because they told me to come when it hurts real bad. - I'm supposed to have surgery on my spine. - Yes? And now I'm getting these headaches… They go all the way back, between my shoulders. Yes? Have you ever been to the hospital for the same reasons? - Yes. - Do you have your hospital card? My cast is broken, but my appointment isn't for another two weeks. To get my cast replaced. Well I've got two chargex. Two cards… Your hospital card and your health insurance card? No, two hospital cards. One of them isn't good. And one is good. Wait. I hope I've got it on me. When you had your cast made, is this where you came? Yes. When I had my cast made, they gave me this card. And when I broke my toe, they gave me… wait. This one, they gave me when I had my cast made, and this one… Which is the bad one? I sprained my ankle. I've been at the hospital since 1:45. And they made me a cast. Anyway, I'm sick of being here and I can't take the bus home. 'Cause I can't… Mom, I'm telling you. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. Huh? No one. I'm alone, I swear. A nurse at station 1. Dr Beaumont. Ms Tremblay, line 2003. Anyway, I don't think it's very nice, that they didn't come get you in a wheelchair. They expect you to get here when there's no parking spots left. - Do you want to stand up? - Maybe. I'll help you. Do you want to go for a walk? Do you think it'll help? No. You sure need patience here. - Dr… what is it? Godon? - Alain Godon. Alain Godon? Do you have an appointment with Dr Godon? No, but he operated on me. And now your hips and leg hurt? - Yes, ma'am. - I'll call for a nurse. Have you been... A nurse on the first floor, please. Maybe we'll get results. Have you been to this ER before? No, miss. I had surgery at Hôtel-Dieu, but Dr Godon works here now. - Do you have your health insurance card? - Yes. With this ailment, you'd have time to die before being treated. OK. What's wrong, Mr… Laroche, is it? Alright. What's wrong? Pain around your left ribs. What happened? I strained it, I think. When did that happen? - Friday at 2. - Friday. OK. You're sure you didn't hit yourself? You strained it lifting something? - Yes. - At work? - A big box. It happened at work? Is it a work injury? OK. Where does it hurt exactly? On which side? - Here. - It hurts there. OK. How old are you? You're 37. No problem there usually? - No. - Nothing special. OK. Take a deep breath. Does it hurt much when you do that? - No. - Try coughing. - Does that hurt? - It's a bit sensitive. What hurts the most? When you raise your arm? Try raising your arm. How's that? Raising my arm doesn't hurt. What's most painful? When do you feel it hurts the most? Sometimes when I… Is it just when you lift something? Does that pull it? OK. - If I put pressure on your ribs like this, does that hurt? - It's sensitive. How about pressure in this direction? Does this hurt? - No, I don't think so. It doesn't hurt. - How about this? - You've never broken anything? - No. A broken rib, an accident, anything? Take a deep breath. Again. OK. Again. Again. OK. Again. - Do you smoke? - Yes. - You smoke a lot? - One large pack a day. - Does it make you cough a lot? - Yeah. When you cough, does it hurt after a while? This thing aside. No? None of that. OK. That'll do. We'll just take an X-ray of your lungs, OK? Just to check what it looks like. I don't think it's anything too serious, other than a good deal of muscle strain. We'll see then, OK? Pardon? - Go to room 5A. That's radiology. - Is this my gown? - … left… - The other way around. The other way. You have to fasten it on the outside, at the back. On what side? This side? No, like this. We'll call you when we have the results. Straight to ER. This one had no luck. Watch his head… - Is that good? - Yeah, that's fine. - Go to number 6. - Number 6. We don't know anything. They came to ER like this. We don't know anything. Not even a name. Nothing at all. - At the ER in Sainte-Agathe? - In Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts. - You have no…? - No, nothing at all. They are two different accidents. One was coming, the other was going, and another accident happened. So there are many wounded, many dead. Unfortunately, I don't know what time the accident happened. In any case, they both got here intubated. The little lady's breathing is up and down. It's irregular. He's breathing quite well spontaneously, on his own. He can move all four limbs. He's got mydriasis on both sides. A bit more on this side. Did you ask for blood? 2000? - Yes, 2000… - 2000 for both of them. And… Indeed, we can see… If you remove this… There's loads here. I see. Wait a minute, I have to make a phone call to cancel… Can you send them in for X-rays as soon as possible? Yes, as soon as possible. Is that for him? Large cervical spine, lungs, thorax… is that it? Alright. I'll prescribe another. Large cervical spine… What do you mean, there's no anesthesiologist? Well, I absolutely need an anesthesiologist in the next 5 minutes, because we're about to start. Well I need… Anyway, I'm going upstairs. Call Dr Hudon at home, will you? If there's any problem, I'm upstairs, OK? On his way to? Alright. Great, I'll be upstairs with the patient in 3 minutes. OK? Perfect. We'll be making a request for intensive care. For this one, I'll prepare the operating schedule sheet and we'll run upstairs with him. Can you check with the blood bank to see we've got our 2000 cc? Is that for the man or the woman? That's for the man. One of them is number 1. The woman got here first, then the man. Her condition is relatively not so critical, because she can move all four limbs. It doesn't look too bad. It's the man who's in a rather hopeless condition. I warned the operating room that we're coming up. - His brain matter… - Yes, there's a wound on the left. It's caved in, and his brain is spilling out. - Guard Sylvestre? - Yes? The blood for Mr X, how long ago did it leave? Mr X… Mr X number 2? There's Ms X and Mr X. How long ago did it leave for Mr X? - It just did. - Alright, OK. If it's not there yet, you'll be receiving it soon. The patient is going upstairs for surgery immediately. So if you could do that as soon as possible. I've got claim forms. I'll sign 2 or 3 for you. For now we've only got #73s. It's probably written somewhere. OK? Thanks. Goodbye. So we'll have blood in 20-30 minutes? He said he'd do it as fast as possible. OK. Then we'll get started without it. I'll try to make them go upstairs right now so they can transfer them. If we could release 2 or 3 patients from intensive care… What we absolutely need is a bed for that patient. You can tell the IC unit that anyway we don't need the bed until… - There's one available bed. - It's 6:15. We won't need the bed until 9 or 10. Not until I've finished this. Is that little guy that was with them? We're moving the other patient upstairs, and we'll start without blood. We'll have to operate on his left side in order to… remove the brains that are sticking out of the wound, fix the wound, and remove the embedded fragments. We'll probably have to operate on the right side as well, because his right pupil is larger than his left and he probably had a contrecoup injury. There could easily be a hematoma. It's still possible that I'll start surgery not on the side where the brain is sticking out, but on the right side because his right pupil is dilated, which could signify a rather significant hematoma which is compressing his brain more on the right than on the left. Alright. We can go upstairs. Does anyone have the elevator key? - The elevator keys? - Let's call the nurse. OK, let's get this going. Hey, can you call a nurse for the elevator keys? Is your nurse available? - The elevator keys. That's a good one. - The elevator keys? - Are you also coming? - I'll come up with you. They are all patient X. So he's Mr X number 2. How old is this one? About 10 years old? The femur, and two hematomas. She only has this wound, but it won't stop bleeding. It's a knee wound. Her abdomen is still flexible. Her thorax is fine. She wheezes a bit, but I mean… not that much. No bleeding anywhere, except here, and even this bleeding, I mean… It's minimal. Comparatively trivial. She's had 1500 cc of blood, can you imagine? Did her heart rate go up with her hypotension? No, it went to 120, but she didn't show hypotension then. Now her heart rate is slowly going down. It was low when she got here. If you ask me… She's got a hematoma somewhere. Mr Carrière to the operating suite, please. Mr Carrière to the operating suite. What is there to do here? - To do? - I'm done with the shock room. - Well, there's this here… - What's that? Number 5 is hospitalization case. All of this is stuff we can do. Dr Provost just saw number 2. I don't know if he's done. You saw my pediatric case, right? I wonder why that child was sent home. - I was looking at X-rays of his foot… - What does it look like? - I don't see anything. - Nothing special? - But… Here's two things. … and a urine analysis for this one. OK? Ask the lady to wait outside for a minute. Alright. What happened to Josée? - She popped her shoulder. - Yeah? The thing is I went to Notre-Dame, and they were supposed to make a cast. I called this morning because I know there's specialists for that here, - for setting bones straight. - Yes? The guy told me I'd better come before… - When did she pop her shoulder? - Two days ago. Two days ago? Did she pop it back in on her own? How did… - No, it hasn't been popped back in. - Where were you seen? - At Notre-Dame. - Then why are you here? It's because I know you have specialists for this. They wanted to make her a cast. I'm having a real hard time understanding. - Well, I called… - They didn't give her a figure-eight strap? - Yes. - Why doesn't she have it now? - I took it off to come here. - Why? - Well, I called ER this morning... - Why did you remove it? The guy told me that before… A broken collar bone just needs a figure-eight bandage. - Dr Dancose? - Yes? Are they common? Patients like her who… Very. Ones that come here after trying three or four hospitals. It's quite common. About as common as those cases who come with problems they've had for three or four months in order to get hospitalized out of nowhere. What are those patients waiting for? The thing is they don't trust one place or the other, or they either misunderstood or didn't get explanations at the other place, so they come here either to get reassurance or to verify the diagnosis that was given elsewhere, usually. They want another X-ray, to see some specialist, or… things like that. To check if it's the right diagnosis and the right treatment. If anything is the least bit different from one place to the next… This one was told "maybe a cast" at Notre-Dame. Immediately, she goes, "How come they told me X at the other place?" That's often how we realize that they've been to 3-4 places before coming here. Obviously it overburdens the ER a bit. - I fell on my knee. - Yes? - I've fractured that knee before. - Where did you go then? - For my first fracture? - Yes. That was 20 years ago. - I see. - That was at Saint-Luc. What's wrong now? When I fell, naturally, it hurt, and I told myself I'd keep walking anyway, because... I thought it would fix itself as I walked. But it didn't get better. On the contrary, it started to swell. There was quite a bit of pain, so I... I immobilized myself. I stopped. I went to bed that night, and the next morning, well... In other words, I didn't bat an eye. The next morning, I went to the hospital in La Tuque, and there, Dr Bergeron told me, "We'll take an X-ray." - Yes? - Then he said, "We'll make a puncture." Because he says there must be blood in there. So they took an X-ray and made a puncture. They removed 75 cc of blood. Then he suggested I keep this bandage and immobilize my leg. - Yes? - And to put ice on it. He says... - This is what you were told in La Tuque? - Yes. - Now you're in Montréal? - That's right. - And now you're in pain? - No. - Why? - It doesn't hurt. Then what's wrong? Why are you here? Well, I'd like to be seen by a doctor in Montréal, because you see, I can't return to La Tuque for... OK, I see. You've never been to Sacré-Coeur hospital before? - Yes. - Yes? To the ER? To the ER? Maybe I've been here before. - Do you have your health insurance card? - Yes. What happened to you? This week... What's the word... - I had some pain in... - You had what? Large container doors, no? - Opening and... - Yes, yes, yes. Closing them. I think I strained my... this here. It was small before, but now it's bigger. - It started with a little lump, but now it's a big one. - It hurts. When you move your wrist, does it hurt? What if you bend it? Bend it. Bend it like this. Does that hurt? Not much, but it hurts here. Sometimes it hurts here. That'll be your joint that's a bit strained. - That's possible. - That looks like a small synovial cyst. We'll take an X-ray to make sure there's nothing more serious. Does this hurt? No, it doesn't hurt, but it hurts here when I strain... Then we'll have an orthopedist see you. That will have to be removed. It won't heal on its own. An X-ray for his wrist. You have to go to room 5A. They will call you. Look how I... Sometimes it hurts here. Sometimes it hurts a little. So I've got a sprained nerve? Alright. He should be referred to orthopedics. It's not an emergency, but if they can see him today - and decide when to get it removed. - They're pretty busy. In that case he'll have to come back to the outpatient clinic. Outpatient clinic... Go to room 5A for your X-ray. I'll be able to go back to work tonight, won't I? No? I'll ask them to see you right now. - Yeah, I have to do this right now. - Yes, I'll just give them this. You can go for your X-ray right now. - I'm supposed to work tonight. - That won't be a problem. - It won't? - No, no. Mr Patrick Ouimet. Where do I go for this? Room 5A. - Five? - Yeah. - You cut your chin? Is that it? - Yes. Alright. Sit down, sweetie. I don't think it's too serious. That's fine. You never know. - He scraped it a little. - Yeah? Sit down. - No, sit down. It's okay. - Sit. Sit. Show me your boo-boo. No need to be afraid, now. We won't eat your boo-boo. It's just to see what it looks like. It will only pinch a little. There. It's over. Let me see. This will need stitches though, because it's wide open. He's five. Is he vaccinated against tetanus? - You know, vaccines for babies, for small children? - No. He didn't receive any shots when he was 3, 6, 12 months old? No shots at all? No vaccine? Never, ever? - Shots? - Yes. - Yes. - Vaccination. No. I prefer French. I understood. - Vaccines... - Yes? - Did he receive vaccines when he was... - Penecillin, no. No, no. Was he vaccinated when he was a baby? - Yes. - Good. He was vaccinated as a baby. Perfect. When did this happen to him? Can you give the little man some anatoxin? We'll send him to the operating suite right away. I'm giving you a little shot so you don't get an infection. OK, honey? Speak to him in English. What can you do? Not there. Look at your mommy, will you? It's over. It's over. Poor fella. Here. We can send him to the operating suite. Take him to the end of the corridor, where it says "operating suite." OK? Wait there, and someone will call you once we have a room to give him stitches. Yes, that looks good. They'll clean him up with peroxide, so it's good. - Will you be sewing? - Yes, yes. Yes, that's why we're sending you to the operating suite. They'll give him stitches over there. OK? Will that work? - Do we have to? - Well yes, certainly. It's deep and it's this long. It definitely needs stitches. This needs stitches. No one is forcing you, but I'm telling you: this needs stitches. But later on, aesthetically, I don't know... We'll make it aesthetic as well. OK? Will that do? Don't worry about that. OK. See you later. Ms Odette Huet. Yes? - Ms Huet, is it? - Yes. Hello. Have a seat. Sit on the stretcher. What's wrong? Mr Louis Lefebvre. Ms Gaudreault? Ms Irène Dallaire? Ms Yvette Hamel. I called his office again, and they told me... "Tell them to contact him." They won't do it. So now I'm waiting. What can I do? You know what's in the fridge, right? Then... Yes. Well, if you're hungry... Yes. Ah, yes. Then... Don't wait for us to eat dinner, honey. We'll get home when we get home. There's stew, you know? And... yes. Eat whatever you want, because I'll make myself some spaghetti. There's spaghetti sauce also. Yes, don't worry. Alright? Bye-bye. I'll help you. Syringe, please. How long has it been in total? It's been 15 minutes. It's 4:18. - When did he get here? - At 4:10. 4:10? It's been 20 minutes. Hold on a second. Should we give it another go? I've got another one that's ready. - Should we continue, or? - I think we'll stop. - Yeah. - Because... He's already showing marks. He has lividity, and no reflexes at all. He was face down! That guy will have to take first aid classes. They should never be face down. Never. That young man is dead. It doesn't happen frequently, but here, it's obvious. It's so obvious, you know? Bringing in a patient lying face down. What's his name? He got here lying face down, his face in the pillow, like this. Not bad, huh? They clearly didn't give him any artificial respiration, first of all. Second of all, when he explained it to me, he hinted that he'd kept him lying face down and given him a massage. Which suggests he gave him a massage in his back. Which is impossible. You would never do that. I mean... Anyone with a minimum of knowledge in resuscitation will never give a cardiac massage to someone lying face down by massaging their back. That's ridiculous. From a medical point of view, it's completely ridiculous. No, it's truly incomprehensible. Anyone with decent training would put him on his back and extend the neck. He'll make sure the tongue doesn't stick to the palate. There's devices called Guedel tubes that we insert to keep the tongue straight. Or you could give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation like this, while pinching his nose. And give a proper cardiac massage with the patient on his back. They don't even know how to pronounce someone dead. Anyone should be able to take a pulse and see whether the person is breathing by putting their hand in front of the respiratory tracts and to recognize when someone is deceased. Not face down. His face was buried in the pillow, Marc. I can't believe it. It's a cycling accident. It looks like he was hit by a car. With the description the father gave us of the brakes, which left marks over a rather long distance... He was hit so hard that he probably died instantly. We always attempt resuscitation nonetheless, until we get the history, but this one really didn't stand a chance. 4 or 5 minutes is the limit for... giving CPR. The accident happened at 4:10, he got here at 4:20. Between 4:10 and 4:20, there was a 10-minute period where... he could have been resuscitated if someone had tried. Properly. It should have been attempted there, obviously. Right from the start. Otherwise, nothing can be done, because an ambulance ride already takes about 5 minutes to go there and back... If it's not attempted on site, nothing can be done. If we had people... Those guys aren't to blame, but they're not trained for this. If we had people who are trained, who could attempt resuscitation on site, the survival chances of accident victims like this one would be better, - Don't you agree? - By at least 50 percent. If not more. Anyway. It is how it is. Is that the other lady? Is she still in the waiting room? In the corridor? Why do you want to see Dr Gougoux? - It's for his pulmonary emphysema. - His emphysema. Is there anything else? Nothing more serious than emphysema? How long has he been grayish-blue like that? His skin tone isn't so good. Has he always been like this? Has he always had poor tone like this? No? It's mostly in the past 15 days? He's been like this since Saturday. He's been getting worse since Saturday? I'll ask the pulmonary disease specialist to come and see him. Is Dr Gougoux... I don't know if he's on duty today. Hold on, we'll have a look. It's Dr Pierre-Émile Gauthier. - Was he ever treated by Dr Pierre-Émile Gauthier? - Yes. - He was last seen by Dr Gougoux. - Has he been spitting blood lately? - No, not at all. He just has trouble breathing? What medication does he take? - Look, everything's there. - All this? - All this. - Nothing else? OK, I saw these already. So that's all he's taking. Alright. We'll ask Dr Gauthier to come have a look at him. - He can't go home like that. - I don't think they'll send him home. Not until he's recovered. It's always the same: hospitals are over capacity. Anyway, the specialist is the one to decide. We don't decide that here in ER. - I don't want to leave him either without... - Don't leave. Stay. In case there's paperwork or anything else, you should be nearby. So don't go yet. My son will be joining me, because we can't leave him all alone. - Of course. - He's too ill. I think we'll keep him in ER for at least 24 hours, that's for sure, but as far as hospitalization goes, I can't give you a definite answer. Only the specialist can decide. He's my brother, so when he gets sick, I'm the one who drives him around, who takes him to a specialist, because back home, there aren't any specialists. All his earliest files are here. So they can see what has happened. Surely they must keep them long enough to see what happened. We've often been here for X-rays. He has a hospital card. OK. We'll wait for Dr Gauthier. - Thank you. - Alright? Do you need me in the shock room? No? Then I'll see these patients here. Is that room free? Can you give me some files, Normand? I'll see some patients next door. Give me 2 or 3. Can I take these? Can you get a nurse to take samples? What seems to be the problem? I was diving and I hit the bottom with my shoulder. Sit on the edge here. We'll have a look at it in a moment. I'll just finish this paperwork. Hold on, I'll give you this. Larynx... half-thorax... Which shoulder is it? - Here. It feels quite hot here. - Yeah? I couldn't sleep last night. - You hit the bottom? - Yeah. Your arm was against your body? It wasn't extended? - Can you move your arm? - More than I could yesterday. - Can you put your hand behind your head? - I'll go gently, but yesterday I couldn't do it. I stayed up all night exercising it. - I said to myself it must be a muscle. - How's your back? - It hurts when I lower it. - It's worse when you lower it? Well, I can't say it's worse. It varies. Oops. OK, stay loose. Stay loose. Let your arm drop, I'll hold it. Let it drop. I couldn't sleep last night. - 1 milligram per cc? - Yes. Only take 10 cc. Don't empty it there! Then you add all that as well... - Got one for me? - Yes, but hold on. - It hasn't melted! - It hasn't melted yet. - Can't I put the starch in first? - No, no... Where's the duty nurse? The thing with nylon is that it's not easy to handle. Nylon is hard to handle. The hell is she... She sure is flaky. Can you try to find her? Or be the nurse, if you don't mind. I'll need 2% xylocaine with epinephrine. The red bottle on the left. That's it. OK. Turn your head to the other side, like I had you before. Alright. Don't move. I want 5-0 thread on a CE-2 needle. Come closer. - Do we show the needle? - Don't show him because... It's quite enough already. Better to give him stitches without... Put the bottle on the right, it'll be easier. Yeah, like that. Okey-dokey. OK, thanks. Did you find it? Can one of you hold his hands? Silk? Good. Perfect. We'll put a cloth over you because the light is strong. Don't lift your hands. Will you hold his hands? Turn your head. Be a good boy. It'll just burn a little. Can you do this like a man? It's a little girl. - It's a little girl? - Yes. - It's a little girl? Oh, well. - Yes. Can you do this like a grownup, then? Be a good girl, now. Can't tell them apart anymore. It'll burn a little. Just don't move. OK? Take a deep breath. Don't move, now. We'll give you stitches. It won't hurt. Your boo-boo is numb now. How are you doing? Don't move, we'll put a dressing on. There. Let's go see your mommy. It's over. Not too bad, is it? Whoops, you lost a slipper. Those are big slippers. Not easy to walk with. How long have you been here? It's been four hours. We came from Saint-Michel. Suffering like this is unbelievable. Is it your first time in this emergency department? Yes. It's my first time in Cartierville. Is a doctor supposed to come? Yes, because it's rather serious. He'll come. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't serious. They know how much pain she's in, too. They call it "emergency". They said they'd send a nurse. I went back, and they said she hasn't come down yet. So she called again. It's all bluff. What can the nurse do, when you think about it? What can she do? The poor nurse. She didn't even show up. There aren't any. It's all bluff. I can't sit still. Have you seen a doctor here before? I mean before your X-ray. Yes, it was a young doctor. I don't know if he was a nurse. - It must be... no. It must be... - In any case, he was quite young. They have their stays here. He's a resident. Let me tell you, something needs to change in the ER. I was in a car accident, I had cuts all over. I was bleeding, and my husband, too... We waited. They forgot about us! - We waited two hours. - They'd forgotten about you? They wouldn't give me an aspirin. Couldn't even give me one. They'd forgotten! Something needs to change. What's the story here? A car accident? It's a car accident. His eye is all... Is it enucleated? Were X-rays taken? No. He arrived, and they brought him here immediately. - Hold on a second. - Watch out for the tubes. Careful with his head. Hold on. - OK? - Alright. - We'll cut this off, OK? - Yeah. - What's your last name? - Champagne. What happened to you, Mr Champagne? Wait a minute. What's wrong? - Does your foot hurt? - Yeah. Careful with his foot. What happened, Mr Champagne? - You had a car accident? - Probably. - I didn't see anything. - You didn't see anything. - Where does it hurt, other than your face? - Here. - In your belly? - My foot too. - Your foot? Your left foot? - Yes. OK. Can you open that eye? - Yes. - Alright. Can you see me clearly with that eye? Can you close the door? - Pardon me? - I'm cold. We'll give you a blanket. Does your belly hurt? - No. - No? You were in a car. Were you driving? Does this hurt? How about this? Wait, I'll test his reflexes first. We'll have to take the dressing off to see. Don't move. Try to stay still. Don't move. I'll tickle you a little. Same thing here. Does it hurt here? - A little. - Trying moving this foot. - Does this one hurt when you move it? - Yes. - Alright. Were you driving the car? - Yes, I was driving. Don't move his head too much. We don't know what the matter is. Crossmatch, blood sample, glycemia... - Are we doing what you said? - Yeah. - What do we do? - We'll use peroxide. Can you clean up around it? Sir, I'll be taking blood samples. Can you also call the ophtalmologist? - Yes? - The ophtalmologist, right away. This is Dr Lepage. It's about a an accident victim who came to us from Saint-Jérôme. His right eye is completely enucleated. The eye is protruding from the wound. The man is fully conscious for the time being. He hasn't lost consciousness. Nothing of note from a neurological point of view. We're disinfecting his wounds right now, then we'll take X-rays. Will you come have a look? Alright. Goodbye. If he can move all four limbs, there's no need to worry. Open one of his veins right away and give him a lactate solution in case of hemorrhage. Then you can start the examination from his head to his toes without moving his head or his spine, or as little as possible. Shoulders, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, hips. If he can move his lower limbs, don't move them. Would an unconscious person show resistance? There would be in case of abdominal problems. In any case, it's very important to check all the joints in the same way, even if he's unconscious. We won't know if it hurts him, but you can check for other problems. - Can you come to the front? Room 6. - Room 6? - Is it only your head that hurts? - Was it a long fall? Did you lose consciousness? Did you vomit? Where does it hurt? Your head hurts? Does it hurt anywhere else? Your back? Your arms, your knees, your legs? Your head is the only problem? Can you turn slowly and lie on your back? No, don't lift your head. Turn. That's it. What happened? A car accident? - No, he fell. - You just fell? - Off your bicycle? - No. No? Where were you? - I was by the river. - You were near the river? Can you do this? No, don't move. Lie still. Easy now. - In room 5 or 6? - Room 6. What's your name? - Stéphane. - Stéphane who? What's that? - Check his retina. - Grenier? We'll clean him up and see what it looks like. Alright. Cranium X-ray and everything. Don't move. We'll do it this way. Does this hurt? And this? At my fingertips. Does that hurt? A little? I can't see. I only see this little thing here. Don't take any off. That's all I see. I don't know if there's... I'll try looking some more, but... - Does it hurt if I touch here? - A little. - It stings? - A little? - Can you do a blood count after? - Yeah. Just a blood count? - How are we doing now? - It burns a little. - Are you having trouble breathing? - Yes. Is it because it hurts or because you feel it's not going in? - It's not going in. - It's not going in. - I'm going to throw up. - You're nauseous? Yes. Can you give the man a kidney tray? It looks like he's got quite a lower orbital fracture here. It's shattered here, and his eye came out. It'll take plastic surgery to rebuild this, then there's his enucleation. Anyway, it seems like there's a strange line here. I don't know what that could be. We'll probably have to ask the radiologist to read this. Those are stones. We see them clearly. His orbit is definitely fractured here. That's certain. Consciousness-wise and neurologically, there's no problem. - Not so far. - He did vomit. He vomited because there was a lot of blood in his stomach. Otherwise, all his vital signs have remained completely normal. - And his lungs, heart, abdomen...? - All clear. He complained about chest pains when breathing, but we don't see anything in his lungs. Is he aware of what's happening? Mr Champagne, do you know that your eye is almost out? - Yes. - Your right eye. Do you know we'll have to remove it? - Do you agree? - We have to...? It will have to be removed because it's practically gone. It's hanging on your cheek. There's no way we can put it back in. We'll make it look nice. - OK. - Are you alright with that? We'll have to repair all the lacerations on his eyelids. - Yes. - We'll repair that. Has he been scheduled for surgery? Not yet. Dr Gaudette was waiting for you. He'll sort it out. We need to work it out with the plastic surgeons as well. Where do I get information? Here maybe? - No one. - It's here for appointments. Where we first registered. Do you want to come with me? Miss, is it here for appointments? - There's no one behind there. - No one's there? The doctor is gone. We waited all this time, and he's not even here. - Do you have to come back? - On Friday. Today is the 30th. It's the 30th. What you'll do is call this number. Tell them that you have an appointment with Dr Godon in neurology. - For the appointment? - Yes. Tell them we didn't have any cards, - and that you have an appointment on the 3rd in neurology. - Thanks. I'll go see if his file is complete. Yes, I can do it. - You can do it? - Yes. Okay, come with me. The doctor will see you. Come with me. They're all occupied. Can I let this girl in? It's for her tendon. OK, come in. Sit on that chair. - Here? - Yes. I think she ruptured a tendon. - Yes? - Dr [...] is at Jarry Park. I called there. I managed to get his seat number. Dr [...] doesn't want to make the trip. Anyway, it's not too serious. I just wanted to call for a consultation. It's a fracture... It's simply a linear cranial fracture. - What shall we do then? - Well, he doesn't want to come over, but surely he will at some point after the game? I'm trying to find out when it ends. Anyway, it shouldn't be too long. It's already 11. Yeah. It should end any time now. Anyway, I'll try calling his wife every now and then. OK. In any case, he's been made aware. - Is that your father? - Yes. I have a few questions I'd like to ask you about him. - Your father's occupation? - Mechanical engineer. - For what company? - The City of Montréal. Do you know the address? I know it's on Des Carrières street. I don't know the number. Do you know the number, Mr Charest? - 1260 Des Carrières. - 1260? Your workplace phone number? - 872... - Yes? ...3445 - How old is your father? - 44 years old. - His birthdate? - The 29th of the fifth... - Not the 29th. July 5th, 1929. 1929. What is wrong, exactly? It's a... He says it's a stomach infraction. Do you have chest pains, Mr Charest? No. Where did it hurt when you decided to go to the hospital? - I was too weak. - Your stomach? And weakness? He was vomiting blood. Alright, that's all. Good luck. Thanks. Come back if you need to, alright? I'll give you back your hospital card. - Come back if necessary. - OK. Be patient. It may hurt for quite a while. Sure. You can get dressed in the washroom, all the way back, to the right. Alright? Aren't you a bit cold? Your gown is soaking wet. Leave it! I've had enough. It's warm. We're in summer. It's warm, isn't it? Is it still warm? Do you have your bathrobe? Did she have a bathrobe? Yes, but it's soaking wet. They gave me this one. I'm sorry, but I wanted to take my things off, but the doctor said, "No, no, no, no." - It's not necessary. - It will be useful outside. How will we come back here? - I'll go sit in the car and wait. - At the dock? - I'll bring her there. - OK, thanks. - Don't go anywhere. - No, no. I'll wait for you. You're not taking pictures of me, are you? - We'll take you in a wheelchair. - Good grief! If it's not far, I can find the way on my own. - No, we'll take you to the dock. - Is it far? Yes, all the way to the dock, it's a bit far. - Slowly, now. - I'd be able to. - Gently. - Yes, yes. After my time here, I'll be able to, believe me. Able to do what now? - Finally! - There. - There, there. - There, there. Anyway, the people here have been very kind. - It's our pleasure. - Will you take her to the dock? We're taking a stroll through the corridors. - Will you be able to walk? - Oh, yes. - There. - Oh, certainly. Hold your gown. Soon I'll be even better at getting in cars. Oh, my goodness. I thank you all for your kindness. It's a work injury. Sir. Sir! Come give us a hand. Yes? - Yes? - One moment. Yes? You called? Yes... - What is it? - Work injury. Go to number 9. I don't know. He fell. Sir? Unbuckle it. - You did the other side? - Yes. Can you turn your engine off? - Is anyone there? - Yes? Can you bring a stretcher to room 5, please? - Room 5? - Yes, please. - Yes? - Can I give you the report? Look, I don't understand it at all. Are you still at codeine? Room 6, Ms Latulipe, leg pain. She needs to have an X-ray taken. Mr Patrice Ricard is a GP case. He's had lab tests, a request for blood... He's been stabbed in the thigh with a knife, probably accidentally. He only has an outpatient appointment in vascular medicine. Miss... Kayn... Knar? Anyway. That's outpatients... No, she's a transfer in nephrology. Acute pyelonephritis. Dr Daigneault is listed on the duty sheet, but I think it's Dr Denis. Dr Daigneault is on vacation. Double-check what was asked. Good evening, this is ER regarding Mr Bouchard, the appendicitis case for Dr Végand. This is regarding Mr Bouchard, the appendicitis case for Dr Végand. This patient will probably be hospitalized in room 466 at Saint-Michel. As for Mr Savoy, who was to be sent there, the head nurse will try to place him in overflow at Saint-Vincent-de-Paul. I'll have news in a few minutes. She wants to put Mr Bouchard in room 466, and send Mr Savoy in overflow. OK? Thank you, goodbye. Alright. That's been changed. The head nurse will call at some point but I want to talk to her anyway, even if she talks about other things. I'll tell her about the open fracture case that came in. That's done. Is someone there? A stretcher in room 2, please. That can be thrown out. I'm pretty much up to date. Miss? Hey there. Miss? She went back to sleep. She comes to from time to time. She tried to say something earlier. Do you know her name? Miss? Hello? Wake up. Good. That's it. Wake up, now. Any idea what her name is? No, and her friend came in and... Miss... Can you tell us what kind of pills you took? Do you know what they're called? I don't know. - How many were there? - I don't know. A lot. Ten? Twenty? You don't know? - Around what time did you take them? - I don't know. - You don't know either? - No. What are those pills for? Are they sleeping pills? Are they pills for your nerves? Sometimes I go out on the streets, and I might as well get killed. I tell myself, "I'd like to get killed and end it all." Yes. I see. But last night you took half the bottle? - Yes. - What was going on? I don't know. It took me suddenly. I don't know what was wrong. I was hopeless or depressed. - You take pills when that happens? - Yes. I'll take everything, even iodine. Anything at all. - Anything at all? - Yes. - To end it all? - Yes. What happens then? Nothing happens. I always stay the same. I don't think we can experience what our patients go through. She was hospitalized for two years at Saint-Jean-de-Dieu. That in itself won't stop anyone from committing suicide, because people can find the means to kill themselves anywhere if they want to. No matter what kind of security is in place. Unless you tie them to their beds for the rest of their lives. Living with her family certainly causes problems which she cannot overcome. It also seems that she cannot live away from her family. So... In any general hospital's emergency department, medication poisonings are our daily bread. I couldn't give you figures as to the number of poisonings that show up here, but we easily can have five or six every day. Unless there's a very clear indication, generally speaking, patients are seen by the outpatient psychiatrist, unless there's something truly, visibly... very manipulative on the woman's behalf. I do mean woman. More often than not, the patients are women. - Who poison themselves? - Who poison themselves. With men, pharmacological poisonings tend to be with alcohol, which isn't much better. It's almost over. - What's that? - That's to clean your stomach. We'll send water to your stomach to clean it. We take it out, put some more in, and... - Is that okay? - I'll leave a dressing here. We're done. It's all the way in. Ouch, ouch. Does it burn? Is it your stomach? Oh, it hurts. Ouch! It's over. They always say it's all over. But it never ends. It never ends. They'll never be able to give us a count. You mean the the eight-hour count? I don't know. I never took the time to check. Approximately how many patients do you see in eight hours? You mean each doctor? What's an average day for you? I never counted, but in twelve hours I must see about 40 or 50 patients. Maybe more. It depends. Yes? Attention: code 777 in room 7. Code 777, emergency department, room 7. Code 777, emergency department, room 7. Wait, I'll just move him a little because... Go ahead. - Did you give it to the girl over there? - Her father is here. The girl at the front desk wanted to see him. - Yes, she went to see him. - Where is the nurse? Can you call hematology? We need 2000 cc of blood on top of the other 1500. He's at the first booth. Can I tell him it's serious? Ah, that's it. It's too far inside. It's because the tube was in his right bronchus. That's bad for his pulmonary contusion. Wait, I think this will be easier. - I'd like to ask a code 9 from Providence hospital. - OK. - Is that for us? - He's not from Providence. You're staying with us. He's wide awake. There's no problem. We'll get his pressure back up. Does it hurt? Are you nauseous? Do you need to spit? No, the tube is necessary. You need it. There's a machine doing the breathing for you, OK? You'll be fine. Don't try to talk. There's a tube. You'll be alright, young man. Is that a big one? Can I have some gloves? - Is someone there? - Yes? Dr Myre is on line 2003. Oh, is he in the house? She hung up. I'll call her back. If he's not here, I must talk to him. We'll put in another tube. Just relax. Just relax. Try to swallow it. Try to swallow it. Oh my, this ain't easy. Trying to swallow it. Did you leave any blood before coming down? - Before coming down? No. - Try aspirating now. Very good. 1200 on the Gomco. Oh yeah. Want me to give you the rundown? He's got fractured ribs and a collapsed lung. I put a tube in. At first he got better, but upon examination, we found a large pulmonary contusion. He literally stopped breathing. He even went into cardiac arrest. Now with the respirator, intubation, Aramine, adrenaline, etc., he's regained consciousness, he's breathing rather well, and we can release him. There are no beds in intensive care. The Bird should be enough. He's a little fella of about 60. But we absolutely must find space for him in intensive care. We don't have any transferable cases. Except maybe Mr Roy. The man I saw today for an apectomy. Maybe we could transfer him. He's stable. Well, transfering anyone bugs me. As for Mr Dupuis, I'd rather keep him for another day. I do have a commusiroplasty case I could perhaps release. Say, are you far away? Yeah? Because I'd like you to have a look at him with me. To see if there's anything we could add. He's still here in the ER, in room 7. OK, thanks. Bye. Do we have to anesthetize him? I couldn't say. He's intubated, and usually... Wait, he's completely dilated. Doctor, should we transfer Ms Roland to intensive care? - Tell her to wait. - OK. - Do you have a flashlight? - This doesn't work well. He's had so many problems with his lung that... He went into shock so suddenly, we should have seen it coming. Dammit, we've got nothing. We don't have a bottle of blood. If only there was a heartbeat. He's just empty, dammit. Did they say they were coming with the blood? What about the flashlight? So we just wait? He just got here. He'd just gotten here when they called for him. I was asked to keep an eye on him, so... He's dilated at 4+ and won't respond at all. It hasn't been long, though. How long has it been? It happens. He's dilated, but earlier he was responding. I'll leave him alone as soon as I have the blood, - If I have the blood and he doesn't respond... - He was in a car accident. He's got broken ribs, and his spleen might be ruptured, look. Look at that mess. He was in respiratory distress when he arrived. We intubated him, and he was doing very well. Then he began stopping and starting. What's wrong with him now? Is he... Is he still alive? Keep on massaging him. As long as we don't have blood, we can't keep him alive. OK? Keep on going. Is it running? - No. - No? OK. Now it's running. It's dripping. Yes. It's going pretty fast. It's not dripping, but trickling down. He's been dilated like this for a while. He's been dilated like this since 8 o'clock. - Yeah? - Oh yes. Can you stop for a moment? His aorta is flat. He's still showing contrast, but... Shit, shit, shit... This looks like encephalopathy. - Is someone there? - Yeah. Dr Jean-Paul Myre is on line 2000. Tell him to cancel it. We've misled you. We told you it would all go well. We were caught off-guard. We probably missed a ruptured spleen because he didn't complain. He was fully conscious. Should we leave his socks on? I'll call intensive care to tell them to cancel the transfer. Hold on. We'll fasten it after. - He was in a lot of pain. - Yes, he was. - You gotta put them... - It's sticking out. You gotta put them on the other side. Hold on. How did you do that? You didn't leave enough. Now it's fine. Perfect. Now we do the hips. Fasten it. I'll hold him. Can you fasten this? Identification tags. I'll identify him. I'll be back in two minutes. It can happen to anyone of us. I remember, two years ago, an anesthesiologist here was called for a case like this one. It was his granddaughter who'd been run over by a car. A ruptured liver. Her liver was split in half. She died in his arms, so of course that's shocking. Do you have to get used to seeing...? No, I don't think anyone gets used to death. You never know. What can I tell you? I'm not ashamed to say it. When we're called, we always think it could be someone close, people we know. What can you do? Because this is a huge emergency department. Last Monday, ten days ago, we saw 320 patients. 320 new cases. That's a lot of people. Deceased Adults 1 Babies You don't get used to it. No one gets used to it. You learn to control your emotional reactions, but... I don't know. Anyway... That's all I can tell you. I can't say more than that. You're real happy when you succeed, and you try to remember the times you succeeded. That's comforting. About the duration of the attempt you make, after a number of... We can see it. If there's no reflex, if like him there are no corneal reflexes... That's the cerebral vitality reflex. If there still are signs of cerebral life, then we continue. As we know, cardiac arrest is not a sign of death. It's when cerebral functions stop. If there's no blood flow to the brain for more than five to ten minutes, we can consider the brain has having stopped fuctioning properly. Even with resuscitation, if there's been that much of a delay, a lack of cerebral blood flow, that turns people into vegetables, as people say. They're not really alive. But if you see that there is a chance of cerebral life, how long do you try resuscitation? Up to how many hours can it go? As long as there are signs of cerebral function, we keep going. One hour, two if necessary. That's why we want a machine that massages automatically so we don't have to wear ourselves out massaging manually. We could have a machine that massages for hours. As long as there are signs. We've ordered one. They're very expensive. 1,500 dollars. It's been ordered. We'll be receiving it soon. We had one before, but it broke, so we bought a new model. Because manually, you have to relieve each other every 5 minutes, and everyone massages differently. Each person will massage more or less vigorously, more or less regularly, That's not good. Massaging should be regular and constant. At the same rhythm as a normal heartbeat. Have you had successful resuscitations even with that method? Let's say one out of ten. That's if we catch them here. The cardiac arrest must happen here. Say you have someone complaining of cardiac pain, with a history of cardiac illness, coming here for treatment, and suddenly, when our backs are turned, they lose consciousness, their heart stops. If we take them immediately, in less than two minutes, we can save them. I've saved two like that before. Two in two years isn't too bad. No, no... It's not a bandage, it's just a dressing for your muscles that got a bit crushed. Pull your pants up a bit higher. When you put them on, always start at the bottom. The whole city is talking about it I don't know if they'll keep him. He's had diarrhea since Sunday evening. There was blood in it. Since Sunday evening. After two days it didn't stop, so I bought some medication but it wouldn't stop. When I called the doctor yesterday afternoon, he said, "Come to my office right now." That's Dr Choquette. He'd like them to keep him here. I don't know if they'll try operating. I don't know. His doctor sent him to Dr Choquette, then Dr Choquette sent him back to his doctor. I don't know what they want to do. That's a lot of back and forth. Normally, we'd take a taxi, but if he keeps being sick like this... He's lost 18 pounds since Sunday evening. He used to weigh over 200 pounds. He's lost 18 pounds since Sunday evening only? He can't eat anything. It goes right through. You must be quite worried. Well, yes. Between us, he's still a bachelor. Everyone else is married. They're all on vacation. In New Brunswick, all over. - You're all alone. - All alone. I don't know. If they don't keep him, he won't be able to keep going like this for long. He's too weak. Would you prefer if they kept him? Yes. They could try surgery, because... If he still won't eat and stays home, he'll get sick. I'm not strong enough to care for him. I don't know what they'll do. There he is. What did they say? Are they keeping you here? We're going home. They're sending you home? You weren't there very long. Will they give you medicine? I don't understand a thing. - That's for the pharmacy. - The pharmacy? First, I have to stop by the office. Alright. Put it in your wallet. Did they tell you to eat? He's weak. He doesn't understand a thing. He hasn't eaten since Sunday. He tries to eat, but he can't. He used to love eating. He loved sweets. But now he's weak. Will you take your wallet and your papers? Let's take a taxi and get out of here. What have you got in there? A shopping list? OK. It's close to the exit. Pardon? This is the information desk. Is it for an appointment? They told me to stop by the office... Why won't they keep him? Is it because there's no room? He won't last very long. Right now we're out of cards. You'll have to call 333-2040 on Monday morning. Ask for an appointment in Gastro with Dr Ruel. Write the date and time here. - I won't remember all that. - Pardon? I won't remember all that. It's written here. "Gastro, Dr Ruel." You'll write down the date and time of your appointment here. When you come back, go to the outpatient clinic. It's on the first floor. OK? Just don't forget to call. G-A... G... That's a G. G-A-S... Gastro... Is this what I have to call? This number here? Yes, that number. It says 2040. - 333-2040. - 2040. She didn't say what I should eat. If you don't eat until Monday you won't have much strength. Where's the exit around here? - Over there. - Alright. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. Has it been a long time, Miss? - Anyone there? - Yes. Do you have a Raymond Marcoux? - Who may have dropped by? - I'll check, can you send... So Claude told you he wouldn't take severe burn victims? - Because there aren't enough nurses to take care of them? - Yeah. When did he... Did he tell you that today? Not today, but two days ago. - What do we do then? - We transfer them elsewhere. - He wants to have them transferred? - You have to call the medical director. Yeah, but he's already been transferred from Saint-Jérôme. That's a bit of a pickle. They were expected to call the medical director. Because they don't have enough nurses to take care of them? ... it's not possible. They've already got one? No, it's Raymond Marcoux. - What's that again? - Raymond Marcoux. - Raymond? - Yes. Mr Raymond Marcoux, please come to the reception desk. Mr Marcoux, to the reception desk, please. Miss, if Mr Marcoux shows up, it's for a phone call, OK? A nurse at Station 1, please. - Is anyone there? - Yes. Do you have a Mr Lacombe? There was an explosion in a garage. At least 65-70% of his body is burned. Dr Roberge told me we've got problems with serious burn victims. Is that still the case? Mr Marcoux to the reception desk, please. A nurse at Station 1. His feet and legs are intact. He has an IV drip that was hooked up to the dorsal vein in his foot. back in Saint-Jérôme. He was transferred from Saint-Jérôme. The accident happened around 5. A venous cutdown would be necessary to have a suitable vein on his arm. Yes. Yes. We're trying to find a place that will take him. We'll call Notre-Dame, we'll call the Royal Victoria. The Royal Victoria will often take them easily. Seriously, you want us to try transferring him? Uh-huh. You lost one because there weren't enough nurses? Yes. Conditions aren't good? Yes. Alright. Yes. Can I have his name? Can you... Diane, can you call number 7 to get the burn victim's name? Guard? Can you give me the name of the burn victim? - Labelle. - Labelle? - And his first name? - I don't know. - Labelle... - Thanks. Sylvain Labelle. Sylvain Labelle. Yes, he was seen at the Saint-Jérôme hospital, where they gave him an IV drip and sent him here immediately. That's all they did with him. In what state can we transfer him? Should we give him a venous cutdown first? He's got a vein at the back of his foot, but it's not... It's not terrific. He arrived around 17:00. It's been quite a while already. It's 18:45 now. His C number is 153... 918... A cutdown? Yes, we can do that. I can do it. Yes. Yes. Don't we need his authorization before doing a transfer? I'd prefer if you called the medical director. Yes, I'll hand you over to the operator. She'll give you his number. One moment. Your resident Camirand is coming to see the patient. He's coming for something else anyway. I'll ask him to write a note at least. OK. Wait a moment. Can you give the medical director's phone number to Dr Brodeur? Line 2002. OK? I'll be going back there. It's an explosion at a gas station. He was in the pit under the car. He was soldering, and there was a spark. Since there's a lot of fuel in those pits, there was an explosion. He has burns all over. His entire thorax, abdomen and back, both his arms, his face, his hair. Only the lower part of his legs are intact. It's about 70% of the surface. The prognosis is rather conservative. It's mostly second-degree burns. I hope he makes it, but he may also not make it. Above 75%, it's usually considered fatal, so... - Are you in pain? - Yes. We'll give you another shot, then. - Let's IV him 25 mg of Demerol. - Is the doctor coming? He's had 75... We don't know when, do we? He's had plenty of water. That's actually not enough water. Neither of those will do much. Anyway, prepare what we need, and we'll see. - I'll try a 25, then. 25 of Demerol. - Intravenous. Try moving your arm away from your body. Yeah, like that. We'll have to give you another IV. The one you've got in your foot isn't enough. We'll make a cut in your arm. Of course we'll anesthetize you. - We'll make a cut in your arm. - Why don't you put me to sleep? Because putting you to sleep is pretty complicated. I can't stay like this. We'll give you medication to take the pain away. We'll give you medication through the vein in your arm. - Let's lower this. - Should we give the Demerol first? Yeah, 25 intravenous. Do you have caps? We don't have caps here, do we? No, we don't. Want me to get some in surgery? What did he ask you to go get? [...] We'll keep it in case he changes his mind. One dextrose, one Demerol. Can I give you these? - Can you bring me all that? - Yeah. Where are the tubes? - The what? - The tubes for... The IV tubes. Are they here? Don't move your hand. Lie back down. Lie down. Mr Patrick Benoît to room 4. Mr Patrick Benoît to room 4, please. A nurse to Station 1. Don't move. This will sting a little. He was in the pit, under a car. Apparently he was soldering. Remove the sheet so that... Remove it completely. Can you bend your legs a little? 9... 100... I'll plug that here. 18%... There's no dextrose in that one? Yes, there's dextrose. 27... My count was 60... 26... That's assuming he's got some on his back. - Is his arm pretty much...? - Yes. Like the other one. 46, 19, 45. Does he have burns on his back? You were on your back under a car? - I was standing up. - Do you have burns on your back? I didn't have time to think about it. Does your back hurt? Does it burn? - Yes, a little. - It burns a little? Can I steal a few instruments? It won't be long. I found my vein. I'm almost done. - Got forceps I can steal? - Yeah, go for it. They have to be... Well, you're sterilized anyway. I'll need regular scissors for stitching this up. - And hook forceps. - 46 plus 5, 51... This shouldn't hurt. If it hurts, tell me, okay? - Is he sedated? - Yes, I gave him 25 of Demerol via IV. Ah, it came back out? Okay, we're inside now. Here, I'll... I'll take samples. Are those the old sheets? Now you can lay this here. Let's leave it like this. - This might get stuck. - 1:50, okay? We could bring it back around. Is that a corner? Raise your behind. We'll pass this underneath. OK, that's good. OK, pull on the other. Raise your behind again. - Have you got them now? - They gave me an answer, yes. Yeah? I can talk to them if you want. We sure waste time on the phone. This is the ER, you know? Yes, this is the emergency department. Pardon? You want news about Mr Neville? What is your brother called? Neville? You're Neville. What is your brother called? Hey Camirand, do you want to talk to the Royal Victoria? - If you want. - They're on 2003. Sure, I'll talk to them. I'll pass them over. We'll probably get their plastic surgeon on the line. - Your patient is doing well. - He's doing well? Good to hear. Come, I'll hand the phone over. Is he on the line? No, she said she'd have him on the line soon. Are there any patients? That's annoying. I had a pen 5 minutes ago. No, of course. - Are you coming to clean up? - I'll be staying here, Claude. I'll see them. What's his name? He wants it in English. He wants in English? Well, if the Royal Victoria are kind enough to take our patient... We'll write it in English. Montréal... Oh! We have to write "July". Get your hands off me! Just mind his arm because he's got a venous cutdown. We need to make sure his tubes aren't being stretched. There shouldn't be a problem with the pressurized IV drip. You know how the pressurized ones work? Just remove the cap and inject some air. Should I hang this here? Will you remember? There's a letter that goes with him. - Yes, I'm feeling better. - Feeling better? It's not a problem if he's got that on him? No, it's not a problem. - Um, 75 Demerol. - It's not an issue. Do you have something to put that in? - Here or outside? - Who's taking the letter? You'll give this to the Royal Victoria. This is the syringe for the pressurized IV drip. Stay still. You have to let them take care of you. Wait. He needs sterile sheets. - He must be cold. - Sterile sheets... Don't get up. Dehydrated patients have a low volume and go into shock. We were late. It's been two hours since he was burned, transferred, etc. That's why we had to cut open a vein, put a tube in it, and give him quantities of fluids that probably would kill an older person because we gave him so much. We gave him lots of fluids. We raised his blood pressure. His pulse slowed down, and his urinary flow rate is good. That's the most important thing. We also cleaned up his wounds, and... We gave him sterile sheets in order to transfer him to another hospital, because there's no room for him here. Because there's no room here to treat this case? Where was this patient being transferred from? He was transferred from Saint-Jérôme. - Why was he transferred? - Because he's a very serious case. I mean, the prognosis is rather grim. You'll have to pull hard. Say when. - OK. - Here we go. - Is he okay on your side? - Yeah. - That's fine. - That's fine? My side is done, how's yours? He's got malignant... tendencies... Lie your head down. What's better? No, his IV is on... He's got an IV on his foot. He's got a cutdown there. He's cold. Let's cover him up as much as possible. If you've got a wool blanket in the car. No wool blankets. That's what he says. He says he's cold. He's cold, that's normal. Maybe we can turn up the heat in the ambulance. Try not to tighten the straps too much. - Don't forget your syringe. - Keep it loose. - Is he going there with the others? - Are you the ones going there? - You're not going? - No one's going? No. About the syringe, just pump every once in a while. On your way? Have a nice trip. - Has anyone told you anything? One moment. Have you been told that he's now at the Royal Victoria hospital? We were told that he was going. What's going on? What's wrong? We can't keep him here because the hospital is already over capacity. So we transferred him to the Royal Victoria hospital, that's all. It's not because of his condition. Had there been room here, we could have kept him. And his burns? He's got burns on at least 60% of his body. It's mostly second-degree, with some third-degree. We've given him IV drips. We think he'll make it. His burns are pretty serious, but we think he'll make it. I mean, he doesn't have any serious damage, any risk of... I don't know, will his eyes be okay? Will his limbs? We'll know in the following days. I know that his vision is good. He's got burns all over, except the lower part of his legs. He doesn't have any other...? Anyway, I think he'll make it. He's burned pretty badly. His burns are rather serious. Which is what I've already told you. So his wounds are pretty deep if they're second- and third-degree? Second and third degree, yeah. So if you want to see him, you should go there. Thank you very much, Doctor. - Good night. - Good night. - C...? - 124-332. - Yes? - 173. - Yes? - 14-621. - Yes? - Last visit: May '73. - Alright. - Thanks. You're welcome. One moment, please. Miss?
