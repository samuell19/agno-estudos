BLACK ISLAND SISTERS - You've got to repaint the place. - Yes. - This summer? - You've been saying that for years. Go on and stare, you bitch. This is the only entertainment you'll get. - How is he doing? - Same as usual, I think. See you later. Hans! Hans! - I'm home. - Mum, I'll miss. Is it a fun game? Eh? Feel in my pocket. hi ho Albert Blue wondering what he's to do? on the bough sat a little bird and sang little brother little brother you're cuter than any other Put them in the frying pan. Put them in the frying pan, Stefan. - Annbritt, hi. - Hi. - How are you doing? - I'm good. And you? I'm meeting Tomas. We're popping over to Boden. - Tell him to look in at dad's too. - Sure. - Hi, dad. - Did you get the brawn? Hi, Svante. Come here, boy. Hello. This is food for old, toothless wolves. Have you been out for a walk today? The gravel gets stuck in the wheels. It needs salting. I've told Tomas, but he ... ... never gets anything done. - Rova's dead. - Is he? - Is it the graveyard tomorrow? - No, tomorrow is Saturday. We're going on Sunday. He worked on my shift, Rova. - I guess he was pretty old. - Like me. They're keeping up well. - A Negro was here this morning. - What? I have to go now, dad. The Finn was here asking for you. Shit. See you tomorrow. - Are you going out? - Yes. You can get pizza or something. There's money in the tin. Hi, Mona. How are you doing? Top of the world? come and hold me I'm enchanted by you - Will you drive me? - No, I'm going out. Has he called? - Are you driving? - No! You'll have to catch the bus. Has Kurre called? What the hell? - What do you want? - How are you? - What do you want? - Okay. - Get your stuff in the garage. - I will when I have the time. Hey, you! Get your stuff, or I'll throw it out, understand? - Yes, I understand! - Good! - That was fast. - It'll get faster, come on. More. Come to mummy. What the hell am I saying? Why don't we go to Thailand? Or Rone. No, Rome. Or Borneo, right? Go dancing at the Karungi Hotel. We need to get some air, Annbritt. The world is waiting for us. - Shall we dance? - Definitely. - Shall we dance? - Yes, why not? - Why not? Put out the cigarette. - Yes. How are you doing, love? Are you thirsty? How did you figure that out? I've got one hell of an intuition about girls ... or women. I work with ... I do analyses. - I'm an analyst. - What? - I'm an analyst. - What do you analyse then? How much forest we have to fell to increase wood production. It's actually bloody interesting. What do you do? I work with iron. I understand. Do you? What the hell are you doing? - I'm hot when I have my period. - Just wait for your menopause then. - Can I borrow a tampon? - Borrow? Here. I need it back next week. We'll put a sauna by the river. It'll be great. Swimming in the nude and looking across the river- - and staring at the horizon and dreaming yourself away - - to China, India and the Sahara Desert. That's the only way to get away from here. On some bloody goods wagons to Borlänge. - Borlänge? - But I'll trick those devils. - I'll get away from here. - Goddamn, Mona. Then you can stare at the horizon and travel all you like. And where would you go then? Some place warm where the men are good-looking - - and think about things other than which snowmobile to buy. Svante, come here! - She made great meatballs. - Now you'll have to do with mine. Now it's time for the evening shift. - Hello, Erik. How are you doing? - Are you on the evening shift? - Did you win on the horses? - No, I only had three right. - I won 200. - That won't get you to Haparanda. Why would I want to go there? They're all dead. I don't give a shit about Haparanda. - How can they live in a crematorium? - Sorry? Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow. Wish your dad happy birthday from me. No, don't do that. - Yes, do. - Okay. Come on, bloody car. Don't come over here. I don't know what the hell I'll do. Hi. Where's your stupid master? Hi. - Where is the stuff? - In there. Did you have fun last Saturday? To the right. Have you forgotten? What the hell? What are you doing, Timo! Timo! - Give me the money. - What? For the car. I want it. You owe me 3,000. I don't have any money now, Timo. Let me out! Timo! What the hell? Bastard! Hi, Tomas. - Found the switch? - Did you have it? - Yes. - The tote paid. Come help me then. I need that damned money back bloody soon. - It's just business. - Shut up. We can always talk about it. Talk? Do you know what you are? You're bloody stupid. I hope you meet someone just as bloody stupid as you. What the hell did I see in you? Your only skill was getting moonshine. Talk? You can't talk to someone who's got a sponge for a brain. - Watch it ... - Shut up! - What an idiot. - Him? Yes, Tomas. He's always been so soft. - Should he have left me there? - No, he should have struck him. - You have to get a man. - Well, that didn't really work out. No, you need to meet someone with a taxi company or some ... Road machinery? I don't have to get a man. I have to go to the scrap dealer and get an exhaust pipe. - Will you be all right? - Yes, will you hand in my coupons? - God, I've stared down this road. - What? - God, I've stared down this road. - Well, then stop staring. It's like time stands still when you turn off here. Hi. He's like a shadow. Exactly like Kurre. Silent. He doesn't say anything, he just walks. I don't know why I stay in this hole. Do you know what I wish? That life was ahead of me and not behind me. That I still had all my dreams. I think you decide for yourself whether life is ahead or behind you. At least you've got a working exhaust pipe now. I'm going to strangle that bloody creep. The bitch or the dog? You've been late five times, - - and the rest of the staff have complained. Take a seat. Yes ... I think your time here is over, my girl. - That won't do. - What did you say? That won't do. All right, one more chance. But this is your very last warning, do you understand? Run along then. Great to escape the dog shift. Mona, I haven't got your money yet. Give it here. - Here. - Have you bought a new bathing cap? Kajsa, how does it feel? No more soot in my ears. I can't bloody believe it. My last day. Are you going to break rock in some mine then? We're going drinking in Hakkas tonight. Are you jealous? Mona? Are you jealous? Australia, a shitty country. What have they got besides sheep? I wanted to go there as a child. I read about a dingo. - But you never went. - I met a guy from Hakkas. - You should have gone then. - Then I'd never have met you, Mona. in our own time dreaming you're laughing at my side dreaming you're laughing at my side You know what, little brother?. Some day you'll see. I have to go now. I have to go. - Are you going out? - Yes, we're singing at Blackies. Are things all right at work? When are you coming home? - I'm 25. - That's when things can go wrong. Please sit down, Stefan. Sit down. It's the Finn's last delivery. - Mona, take it easy now. - No way. One more time? you're leaving the black Northern gold for the hot desert sand and leaving behind your sisters of steel no more tough shifts no more tepid sausage ... Come on! - Mona! - Wait up, I've lost a shoe. - There goes the Finn's last drops. - What the hell. Come on. Kajsa, Kajsa, Kajsa! - You'd better bloody shape up. - Take it easy, right to the top. Annbritt! Hi. - You were great. - Thanks. - Really bloody great. - It was fun. Why are you here? Do you know Kajsa? No, I was just passing and heard you were playing. I haven't seen you before. But now I've seen you. Stop going on about him. It's been five years. - It's two years and eight months. - Five. Piteå in an expensive caravan. It was cold with mosquitoes everywhere. And then that blonde crocodile came and took what she wanted. - Blondie, where have you been? - Nowhere. Is than in Piteå? We sang and now I'm standing here. That's good. I like things to stand still. Everything in its place. "In your basket," my mum always said. If you wanted to climb the fence, your fingers got rapped. Bam! - So you're going to be a singer?. - Maybe. No, stick to the cleaning. Now, that's life for you. - Just because you ... - What? Watch it now. You don't know shit about my life, or do you? I'll tell you something. You wouldn't survive one day of my life. So don't you come and talk about my life. Just wait and see. See what? How you lower yourself over the works like a black angel? - Are you the only one with dreams? - No, everybody has dreams. You'll go a bloody long way. You'll go all the way to Hakkas. Crappy Hakkas. Full house in crappy Hakkas. - You'll be a success. Mona knows. - Cut it out, Mona. Hell, Mona, you're so bloody mean. You monkey. The mean monkey. Call the exterminator. What the hell are you doing? What's with you? It's vitamin deficiency. - Can't you just shut up? - I know. Do you want some wine? You're too much. You should try your own poison. I have. We should have gone to Thailand. Or Turkey. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi, Mona. - Hello there, Sune. - Are you here to hear me sing? - Yes. You were great. It's hot ... in Australia. - Yes, but are you going there? - No, no, no. Thanks for tough shifts and parties. Good luck in Melbourne. We've bought a little present from all of us at the works. And we'd like to sing a little song we've written for you. Mona! Blondie? Blondie? - We'll start without her, come on. - What are you up to? - Do you think you can do anything? - I'll get her. Blondie! Blondie! I'm sorry. Forgive an idiot. Hi, my very favourite little brother. Would you like to hear my new song? It's okay, mum. Don't be afraid. Which button do I have to push? What's this? Is this the "no fear" button? Where is the "be brave" button? We have to find it, little brother. We have to find the "be brave" button. Sune, what the hell are you doing here? Sune! Get out! What the hell are you doing here? Get out of here. Get out! Out! Get out! Hell, Mona. How could you sink so low? I forgot my shoes. Bye. Why does life have to be a bloody living hell? Can you tell me that, God? No. Shit. Poor Mona. Poor little Mona. Poor lonely Mona. Poor old Mona. - Are you new? - Yes, I started yesterday. Just stick with me and everything will be okay. Keep an eye on the level. Get it down! What are you doing? Shut the ladle! Move the ladle! Well done. - Thank God no one was injured. - What's God got to do with it? We are the gods. We are the angels of iron, right? Yes, absolutely. - Do you know a good bar?. - Where are you from? - Överkalix. - Then go home. I asked you nicely. What a stuck-up bitch. They're always like that. You can just go to hell. It was in the summer. It was hot as hell. We had some young guys from Pajala working there for the summer. It was at the molten strand. Suddenly it blew up. One of them was far too close, and I shouted to him, but ... It was too late. It was my fault. He should never have been there. Good boy. Good boy. - Is tomorrow Sunday? - No. The cold is coming. Isn't it always? What are you seeing, dad? - Oops. - I'm sorry. - Aren't you a singer in that band? - What? You're pretty good. Your band. You're pretty good. I've heard you. You know you get tinnitus from that? Yes. It's the volume. It's not good for you. I have to ... Wait up. What are you doing tonight? Would you like to do something? Yes. Okay. - At seven? - Sure. I'm working on a project for Borlänge. - Trying to make stronger steel. - Okay. But down there I'm working mostly with resilience. Okay. - But steel isn't just steel. - No. There's ... We are number one in the world at making steel. China exports a lot of steel, but not of the same quality. There are different ... ... different qualities of steel. There's high-tensile steel and extra high-tensile steel - - and ultra high-tensile steel, so that's ... There's everything anyway. - Have you been to Paris? - No. It's real nice. At least when they ... You know, the Eiffel Tower ... When they built it in the late 1800's, - -they used 6,000 tons of steel. If you were to do that today with our ultra high-tensile steel, - - you would only need 1,800 tons of steel. - What are you doing here? - I'm sitting. - Where have you been? - Nowhere. Come and sit down. How is everything? Well ... - And school? - Okay. Is it fun? It's Hans. Yes. Do you know how many tons of steel it took to build the Titanic? 6,000 tons? Yes, maybe. I have no idea. That might be good to know. - Are you hungry? - No. - Hi, Blondie. - Why are you looking so happy? Did you get a record deal? You've met a guy. Congratulations. - Blondie's met a guy. - How great. Is the dreaming over then, Britney? That's what happens. They drown you in their laundry, their dreams and their nonsense. - Shut up! He's not like that. - What? Like all other guys? Shut up, Mona. Konrad is pissed off because you walked out. How can you work with someone who doesn't give a shit about anyone? - Listen up now, little Britney. - Shut up, you bitter hag. There we have it. You've been longing for that, right? Take care you don't go down the drain. You're on your way ... Cut it out, Mona. Let me tell you something about life, Blondie. It happens this fast, and then one day it's bloody over. We're not talking about life, but about the band, right? it's only us in our own time I'm dreaming you're laughing by my side nothing stirs but what we do I'm dreaming that we'll never die you sang for me come with me now we have to go I can't find a place we have to be two come with me now we have to go I'm singing the words I know you understand an angel's walking in my tracks How about getting started? - What key? - You only know one. - What did you say? - Nothing. Hi. Yes. Okay. Bye. That was a nice song. But you don't walk out on a gig again. Mona, shape up now or you're out, understand? - Understand? - Yes! Good, let's take it from Blondie's verse. C? Okay? It went well tonight. You hit all the notes, Mona. Bye. Bye. Come on, old girl, we'll catch the bus to Svartöstan. - He was good-looking. - They're the worst. Sankta Lucia Sankta Lucia then on our darkest night comes with her shining light Sankta Lucia Sankta Lucia - Where have you been? - Nowhere. - Why didn't you call? - We were at my place. Hi, it's me. I know it's late. Everything's late. I know. But listen ... I don't know. He's like a shadow. He comes and goes and doesn't talk. What? Then tell her to go to bed. Tomorrow? She can't bloody decide when I'm going to call. Tell the stupid bitch to go to bed! Hello? No, Mona, don't be scared. It's only me, Sune. I just wanted to ... ... tell you that you looked very pretty today when you sang. I wanted to ask you if you would like to go dancing sometime? Or maybe go to Turkey? You're pale. Are you hung-over, or are you pregnant? Christ, you are. Are you stupid or something? You don't have to get pregnant. - Shut up. - He'll be really excited. Believe me, they always are. What is it? - How about the cinema tomorrow? - Tomorrow? Sure. Was that what you wanted to talk about? The cinema? Would you like to have a baby with me? Of course. I want to have lots of babies with you. I'm pregnant. - Now? - Yes, now. - But how ... - I forgot. You forgot. - Would you like to? - What? Would you like to? - I don't know. We'll have to ... - Figure something out? ... figure something out. I don't know what to say. - We'll have to fix it. - You mean, get rid of it? Get rid of it. I don't know. Isn't that the best thing to do? I'm driving you home. I have to ... ... think a little. You can understand that. Dad wants klenetter cookies for Christmas. And a Christmas tree. It has to be a real one. I have to go chop one down. Maybe you want to come? I don't care about Christmas trees. I'll use the one from last year. Poor Blondie. How stupid can you be? Christ, what does he want? How stupid can you be? Hi. - We were supposed to talk. - I had some work to do. I want to talk now. We were supposed to. - Weren't we? - It's not that simple, understand? Understand and understand. I understand we have to talk. Do you? - I can't handle being a dad. - Okay. I'll get rid of it then. - But you are coming? - Coming? Yes ... Of course I'm coming. Absolutely. I have some work to do. - Can I call you later?. - Yes. - Why didn't you bring a chainsaw? - You chop down a Christmas tree. Sometimes you're just so bloody stupid. - You chop now. - Me? Hello? Hi. What's up? Okay. Yes, of course. I'll talk to you later. Take care. That was Blondie. She's feeling really sad. - What did I tell you? - Just shut up. Hell. I'm wetting myself. Have you found the "stop screaming" button? Blondie? I've lost all my buttons, little brother. You have to help me, little brother. Crap car. Hi, Svante. I'm here now, dad. They took him to the hospital. Hi. - Is he going to die? - We're doing everything we can. You can sit and wait and then we'll let you know. Shit, dad. Couldn't you have picked some other day? What am I to do with the food? The meatballs and the brawn ... ... and the ham and the whole bloody lot. Shit. Shit, dad. Erik Rausa is dead! Who cares about a Rausa, dad? Tomas, hi. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. Dad has died. Yes. This evening. On Christmas Eve itself. I'm on my way to dad's. Svante is all alone. Can't you come? No. Okay. There you are. You poor thing. Hi, Svante. Little Hans, you're eating very nicely. - Do you drink a lot? - 15 litres a week. - That much? - That much. - Weren't you going to ... - Quit smoking? No. ... change the drapes? A bit more color, I think. I did change them. Really? Yes, really. How is your father? Good. I'm going there for New Year's Eve. - Maybe I should ... - No, that's not a good idea. Father Christmas. Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to give you a little present. - I hope you like it. - Yes. Thanks, Sune, it's very nice of you, but ... Well, I won't interrupt any longer then. - No. - But I'll see you later. - You look great. - Thanks. I'll just wish you all a very merry Christmas then. - Was that your boyfriend? - Shut up. Not a word from you. we're only here for a little while with all of life's toil all you pixies fill your glasses and let's celebrate Cheers, Svante. Merry Christmas. Are you going to work? How did it go ... - What do you care? - Of course I care. Hi. I'm just fetching the new samples. How did it go? It went this well. Now you know how well it went. Hi. - Hi. How are you doing? - Okay. Are you okay? Empty. It's just so damned empty. Poor Svante. He's probably wondering what's happened. Listen ... Well, about that money. I know it's not really the right time, - - but with Christmas and all. - Yes, I'll fix it. - Good. I'll call you later, okay? The funeral and all that. Bye. I'll talk to you later. He's always kept out of the way. When you need him, he's gone. Dad said he was soft. - What a nice tree. - Yes. At least he got his tree. What's wrong? I don't know. It just packed in on Christmas Eve. Just like dad. - Thanks. - Thanks for the help. Well ... I don't know ... Neither do I. - I'm so sad. - Yes, of course you are. Dad always used to say, - - that tears were a waste of liquid. "Are you wasting liquid, girl?" he would say. it's only us in our own time I'm dreaming you're laughing by my side nothing stirs but what we do I'm dreaming that we'll never die you sang for me come with me now I can't find a place we have to be two come with me now come with me now we have to go I'm singing the words I know you understand an angel's walking in my tracks come with me now we have to go I'm singing the words I know you understand an angel's walking in my tracks Stefan has found the song button. You're the best, little brother. The best. Now then, Mona, just take it nice and easy. Don't get desperate. Don't get so desperate. Okay? Would you like some crisps? Here you go. Hi, Mona. Welcome. It's been a long time. Why don't you go upstairs and play? Have you seen Kurre lately? I've heard he's having a baby, but I guess you know already. Hi. What a tan. You're looking great. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year. I have to catch the bus. Happy New Year. I've been longing for you. Actually, it feels like he's still sitting there in his chair. And waiting. He would always sit there when you'd been out, - - and then he would look at you so that you weren't drunk. I never dared go home when I was drunk. Now only Svante is waiting. The poor thing is alone now. I'm alone, too. I mean ... Yes. I remembered that I thought you were good-looking. You did? And you were so bloody great at football. - Was I? - Weren't you? No. I don't remember. You were always just Tomas' little sister. - And then you don't exist. - Exactly. But now you exist. Micke, I don't know ... Neither do I. But being with you makes me happy. Hans! Shut the door! Who the hell was that? Goddamn, how you look, Mona. Happy New Year. Same to you, bitch. Hans? Hans? Hans is gone! Happy New Year. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm driving Hans home. We agreed that he was to spend New Year's Eve with us, right? What a great mood you're in. We had fun yesterday, right? There were a lot of rockets. How did you do? Do you know you have your nightie on back to front? Mona, you have to shape up. - Shape up? - You're beginning to look worn out. You stay the hell away from Hans. - He's mine! Understand? - What's that supposed to mean? He's mine! He's mine. Mum ... You're mine, understand? You're just mine. Kurre is having a baby, and I got as drunk as a skunk. - Actually, I almost drowned. - What? You heard me. I drowned. I dived into the Arctic Ocean and saw a very ugly fish, and you know what? It was me. I almost scared myself shitless. I'm sorry. I do go on. - I'm sorry about your dad. - Yes. - He was pretty old, wasn't he? - That doesn't matter. He was my dad. He taught me how to fish and ... ... drive. Ride a bike. I don't remember anything about my dad. I remember a big coat, but no head. - That's what's wrong with me. - What's wrong with you ... What? It's that you're always looking back. You never get anywhere. To hell with him. That was then. This is now. - Sune wants to take me to Turkey. - Then go, Mona. sun and heat and perhaps some love. - Go. - Where are you going, Mona? - I didn't think we were speaking. - I guess I have to. Sorry to hear about your dad, Annbritt. How are you? I hosed him down. You should have seen his ugly mug. Goddamn, it felt good. Want one? I guess you're out. - No. - Did you quit? one day I'll be lying six feet under the ground hearing the rain dripping and the birds in the park no debts to pay no sorrows to bear just a stone with my name and people passing by maybe you'll come and mourn maybe you'll put down a rose maybe you'll miss me despite all that I've done maybe you'll think he wasn't such a bad man he had goals and ambitions slipped away and disappeared one day I'll be lying six feet under the ground hearing the rain dripping and the birds in the park - What about the dog? - What? What about the dog? I guess Tomas will shoot it. Wouldn't a cremation have been better? He didn't want to be burned. How odd. Everyone gets burned these days. Thanks, dad. Thanks, Erik Rausa. Do you remember the gig at Hakkas? Petrol and Café at Hakkas. I don't want to remember. Don't you remember how foul they all were? At Hakkas? I only remember how foolish they all were at Hakkas. Come in. Hi. I just thought I'd drop by. Come on in and have some brandy. It's dad's reserves. - Where have you been? - Working. Sour Sivan. Shit. - Want some cake? - Yes, please. Let's drink to Blondie. Here's to you dumping that jerk. - Well done. - Cheers. Here's to us. - How is the writing going? - Good. Do you know what I think you should do? - Want one? - No thanks. I think you should ... Have you quit smoking? You should write a song about us at the works. Us ordinary people. We are the ones who are great and angry - - and magnificent and desperate. About the old hags at the works? We're bloody well worth a song. - Yes, maybe. - Let's drink to that. - What is it? - Can't you hear it? Life is on its way. There it was, life. - Here's to life. - Here's to life. Hi, what's happened? He's stolen computer games and stuff. - Easy now. It can't be that bad. - He's stolen stuff! - Kurre Friberg. What's happened? - We have to keep him a bit longer. - Why? - There seems to be more to it. - How long will it take? - We don't know. - We have to see him. - We'll let you know. - Haven't you noticed anything? - What? That's bloody typical. - We can't just leave. - They'll call when they're done. - But ... - We can't just stand here. Is it true that you're having a baby? Yes. - What's she got that I haven't? - Mona, that's not it. - What then? - That's just how it is. It was just over. We ... - You and I ... - Why? It was just over. - Can it be over just like that? - Yes. - What? - Yes, apparently. - But if I had known ... - You can't know that. There's nothing you can do about it. - Kurre ... - I have to go. I don't want to be so bloody lonely. Then call me. - What about Hans? - Call me when you know something. Then we'll talk. I have to go. Okay. Yes ... Yes. Bye. Here he is. We'll let you know. - Haven't you got any cola? - Take it easy. Now tell me what's happened. - It was the others, not me. - What others? - Nobody you know. - What the hell have you done? Nothing. They thought I had pinched some computer games, - - but this guy said I had them in his bag, and then it all went wrong. Then I got the blame. I didn't do anything. - What about the ones in your room? - I got those, mum. - You got them? - Yes. - What happens now? - He told you, he'll call. Up you go. Good boy. - Bye. - Bye. Annbritt! Where are you going? I have to ... - No! - What the hell are you doing? - You're crazy. - He gets to live a little longer. - Welcome back to life, Svante. - That's the last time I help you. Hell, you can't just take my son away from me? - It's only temporary. - Who do you think you are? God? - We don't smoke here. - That's a surprise. Mona, listen to me now. You seem to need some help ... with the boy for a while. - You're not setting any limits. - What the hell do you know? You sit here in your bloody ... No, Hans is coming home with me. No, he's not. He has committed a crime. - Social services are responsible. - To hell with social services. We have decided that he has to stay at an approved school. Stay here. They are taking my boy away from me. What's happened? They say he's pinched some computer games and that I can't handle him. - What about Kurre? - Kurre! He has to take care of the blonde crocodile. He has no time for us. Am I a bad mother? Yes, pretty bad. Actually, quite lousy. But I just wanted to ... be a bit more ... To be happy. Maybe. Let him get away. It'll be good for him. And don't corner people like that. Let Kurre go now. I'm so bloody lonely, Annbritt. I know. But right now Hans is probably lonelier. - Don't feel so sorry for yourself. - No. It's his turn now. Yes. Bye. No, but ... - We have to move. - Good. It's spring soon. - Will we be living in a tent? - It'll be fine, mum. I promise, little brother. One day you'll see me on stage. Then I'll sing just for you, my very favourite little brother. you sang for me come with me now Right, little brother? - Are you pregnant? - Yes. It'll be fine, mum. I promise. Hi, Hans. It's mum.
