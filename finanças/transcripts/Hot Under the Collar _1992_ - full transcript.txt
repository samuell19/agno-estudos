[mysterious music] [comical music] [indistinct chatter] Curly fries, good choice! Try them with horsey sauce, huh? -Hey, hey, J.K.! -Hey, guys. What's up? Uh, Theo's dong. [chuckles] Very funny. You guys want something to eat? No, we heard there was going to be a sorority party over at UCLA. -Thought we'd check it out. -What sorority? Uh, Hubba Kappa, something like that. That's Alpha Kappa, doofus! Right, Alpha Kappa Doofus, whatever. -Want to come with, Jer? -Nope. Got to work late. Then I've got a date with Monica. [Theo] Ooh, you guys getting serious or what? [Jerry] Well, let's just say that tonight is the night when Mr. Train should be hitting the magic tunnel. [Zoomer] You're taking her on a train? So what's the big plan? [chiming] "The Complete Guide to Hypnosis"? Oh, you guys are starting a lounge act. [suspenseful music] -[chiming] -[TV in background] [whispering] ...ninety-four... ...ninety-five... -Good evening, friends! -...ninety-six... And welcome to the holy hootin'-nanny. Now, tonight I want to talk to all of you about communicating with God! Ooh! Damn, Jerry, I don't get it! How come you always get the hot babes like Monica and we have to go begging for dates from the Hubba Kappas? It's all a matter of attitude, Zoom. You gotta be loose, you gotta be cool and you gotta be confident. Hummata, hummata, hummata... [Jerry] There you go, perfect timing. Now go over there and make something happen. -Damn, let's go for it! -That's the attitude, Zoom. -Now remember, you're loose... -I'm loose. -You're cool... -I'm cool. You're confident. Don't push it. Go get them, boys! [sighs] Oh, God... Evening, ladies. Come here often? So, you chicks up for a little hide the banana tonight or what? Beat it, bozos. Right. That's cool. I can deal. I'll catch you babes later, huh? Jesus, God! We must keep our eyes and our ears open because I will tell you, right now. There will be a sign from God, for you, for you, and for you. Today, and each and every day, you must look for that sign. And when you see that sign, you must say, "Yes, Lord, I hear you talking to me!" Ooh. And you must devote yourself to God from that moment onand let nothing stand in the way of your life long service to the Lord! And I do mean Jesus. [weeping] [woman singing] [stutters] Okay, Mom. Thanks. [weeping] [comical music] [screams, laughs] Oh, look... The lights! They look like lost angels searching for divine redemption amidst a dark sea of metaphysical nothingness. Don't you think? Oh, yeah. [Monica chuckles] So what do you want to do now? [sighs] Well, I'm not allowed to name it, but I will say it involves two excited organs and a change of underwear. New idea, you want to work on our hypnosis? Okay. -You've been practicing? -Yeah, I have, but... I don't know, I'm just not getting the hang of it. I'm doing something wrong. It's easier with two people. You know, I bet you're right. Okay, let me do you first. Okay? -Oh, okay. [chuckles] -[chuckles] Okay. Now... Relax. Okay. You are very... -...very relaxed. -[suspenseful music] You are very sleepy. Your eyelids are very heavy. You are very, very sleepy. [gasps] Wow! -That was great! -Jerry, you ruined it! I changed my mind. I want to do you first. Are you sure? Kick back, relax. Just keep your eyes on the crystal. Okay. [chuckles] Relax all the tension in all of the muscles in your entire body. You are getting very relaxed. You, Monica, are completely relaxed. You feel and hear nothing but with the sound of my voice. Your eyelids are getting heavy and you are feeling very sleepy. When I count to three, you will fall into a deep, deep sleep. One, two, three. When I snap my fingers, you will wake up and remember nothing. But you will find yourself irresistibly attracted to Jerry Kaminsky. You will crave his strong, masculine hands all over your eager nubile body and you'll want to make mad, passionate love with him. Do you understand, Monica? Yes, I understand. Good. Ready? [suspenseful music] [thunder] [sighs] Make me scream, little cowboy! [screams] [Jerry] Yes, yes! Yes! [celestial music] [gasps] [Monica] Oh! The sign! The sign from God! [Monica chuckles] Oh, yes, Lord. I hear you. Monica, what are you talking about? [gasps] I'm coming, Lord. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, Lord. To love you, and to serve you, and to be your groveling slave... -Monica! -...the rest of my days. Wait for me, wait for me! [Monica screams] -Bro, vicious babes! -Mine, too! Did some dudes just run by here? -Thanks. -Let's get them. [suspenseful music] Yeah, it's him, alright. -Are you sure? -Sure I'm sure. -How do you know for a fact? -Because I know, alright? Remember, I am the man that makes the plan. Let me see. [imitates bird] Yeah, it's him, alright. Thought I just heard myself say that. -Let's get him. -Whoa. What do you want to do? Just run up there and say, "Excuse me, Sisters, but can we kidnap your handyman so we can cut off his nuts?" Okay, okay. So what do we do? Doofus! We call Cleeghorn, that's what we do. Stuey, why do you always call me a doofus? I don't know, Bean. Maybe it's because you're such a doofus! I hate that. [Jerry] Anyway, I'm glad she's alright. Thanks for the info, Mrs. Woolsey. Bye. A convent! -Huh? -She joined a friggin' convent! [laughs] It's not funny, Theo! You've pissed off a lot of women in your day, Jerry, but you've never driven any of them to this. I didn't drive her to anything. She just up and ran off. What convent did she go to? You guys are not going to believe this: the convent of the Blessed Virgin. No shit! What's that? It's where the nuns from Virgin High live. And no comment from you! Look, you have to admit that there is a pattern here with your girlfriends. First, Christy Murphy gets sent to school there and now this? All I know is something is definitely wrong. Monica is not the nun type. Maybe she really had a calling. It does happen, you know? [girl crying] Sherry, what's the matter? She's having doubts. Doubts? What kind of doubts? Oh, Monica, I don't know if I'm meant to be a nun. I can't memorize all that stuff like you two can. Oh, sure you can! You just have to stick with it! Come on. Did you know that when Mother Theresa started she didn't know a plenary indulgence from a cocktail weenie? Oh? Well, it's more than that. I want to serve God, but I... I miss my old life. I miss school. I miss shopping. I miss Bon Jovi, and beach parties, and Albuquerque turkey sandwiches. And you know what I really miss? Boys. [sighs] You know what? I think I'm having doubts too. Will you two cut it out? I mean, okay, look. It's perfectly natural to have doubts at first, but a year from now you'll say, "Jesus Christ, do I love being a nun!" And he'll say, "Yes, you do." Yes, but... no more dates for the rest of our lives. Ay, ay, ay! You two are taking the entirely wrong attitude here. Okay, look. Who's the studliest guy you can think of? I don't know. Jean Claude Van Damme? [Sherry] Rob Lowe. Okay. Well, mine is William F. Buckley. So let's take Jean Claude, Rob and Bill all rolled into one super-tough dude, multiply it by one hundred billion and what have you got? Heaven on earth? No, silly! You've got God. God! Who could be studlier than God? [thunder] And just think we are all going to be married to him for the rest of our lives. Could anything be more exciting than that? [Sherry] I guess not. 'Course not. Besides, if you two quit now, you'll probably roast in hell for all eternity. [thunder] And we don't want that, do we? [Monica sighs] [holy chanting] [thunder] [Cleeghorn] Why don't you talk to me the way you do, you know? [Rowena] What way? You know, that baby talk. -[pants] -Right now? Yeah, yeah. [laughs] [imitates baby gurgling] -Oh, yeah. -[giggles] [dramatic music] [Cleeghorn] What do you two bozos want? Good news, sir. We found Max Moolash. Really? Yeah, he's hiding out in a convent. Yeah he's pretending to be a handyman or something. We finally caught up with that ungrateful little weasel. When I think of how I practically raised that kid into a respectable life of crime it just makes me... [grunts] Well how did you find him? -Well, in all modesty sir... -Never mind! The point is: we know where he's at. Now all we gotta do is get to him to find out what he did with those stones he lifted from us, I mean me. Now... How might we go about this, I wonder? Well if I might suggest a couple of Uzis and a grenade launcher. Nah, forget that. That's too risky. Besides, Moolash is one tough nut to crack which is something I taught him myself, by the way. Nah, nah, we need a more subtle approach. We need somebody with experience in the art of persuasion. Somebody... who understands men. Knows how to make them play ball. Now, I wonder, who do we have in this organization that fits that bill? -Sir, I think it's obvious-- -If I might-- Stupid idiots! I'm talking about Rowena here. [Stuey] I knew that sir. He's talking about Rowena there! Now... We send Rowena in a disguise. Alright? And you two boneheads, you watch her and the whole place. And make sure Moolash doesn't get wise and try to split or something. Now, you think you can handle that? No problem, Mr. C. Good! Because if you screw this up, I'll run both of yous up a flagpole by your macadamia nuts. Now get the hell outta here! -Thank you, sir. -Right, come on, Beano. Now... where were we? [baby talk] [doorbell ringing] -Good morning. -Ah, good morning, sister. And you are...? I'm Sister Flavia, the Mother Superior and who might you be? Me? I might be Sister... Tiffany. -Sister Tiffany? -Uh-huh. Well what can I do for you today? Well I'm in this country on kind of a foreign exchange program. And, uh... [Flavia] Where might you be from? Uh... Idaho! And, uh... That's not a foreign country. Of course it isn't. How silly of me. Uh, Canada. -That's foreign, isn't it? -Yes. Well, I'm from Idaho, Canada. A little out of the way convent in the north woods. And we are travelling across America going from convent to convent, spending a week or two at each one, just helping out, getting to know the Sisters, what have you. It's kind of an international goodwill mission for the Church. I see. Let's go inside and talk. Bless you, sister! [sneezes violently] Sorry. Conditioned reflex. [intermittent beeping] [Stuey] Well, she's in. [radio crackles] Are you sure? [Stuey] Sure I'm sure. How do you know for a fact? [Stuey] Beano, would you quit asking me that? Hey, I just wanted to make sure, that's all. Hey, as long as I'm here, you can be sure. [epic music] -Like I told you, I am the man that makes the plan-- [distorted crackling and whirring] [electronic feedback] What's that? Oh. [laughs nervously] Please excuse me, sister. I had beans for breakfast. [whirring continues] [noise stops] [lively music playing] I've got it! You call up the convent, right? You ask to speak to Monica, right? Then, when she comes to the phone, you try to talk her into leaving. -And? -And that's it. [scoffs] That is the stupidest thing I ever heard! Theo, he's right! We might as well start out with the obvious. We'll put you in room 6. I'll see to it that you'll have clean linens. Sister, what are you looking at? Me? Oh nothing. I, I, I just had this little twitch in my butt. [Flavia] Uh-huh. [laughs uncomfortably] Well, let's get you settled in. Bitchin'! I mean, thanks be to God. Tell me, sister, what is this Saint Tiffany the patron saint of? Saint Tiffany? [stammers] -Jewellery. -[screams.] [laughing] Jewellery, that's... that's precious. [phone rings] Excuse me. Good morning, convent of the Blessed Virgin. I'm just going to go outside and pray for a few minutes if that's okay with you. This is Sister Flavia, may I help you? [fake voice] Hello, this is Walter Woolsey, I'd like to speak to my daughter Monica, please. Mr. Woolsey, we talked about this yesterday. No one outside the convent is allowed to speak to the new postulants, including the parents. The girls must be isolated from the world for at least three months. Well this is kind of an emergency, you see. Her grandmother slipped into a coma this morning and whoa! You told me both of her grandmothers are dead. Did I say grandmother? Whoa, what a bonehead! I meant her aunt, her aunt Philamina. She has no aunt Philamina. Well, we just call her aunt, see, she's more of an, an uncle. She had this operation and everything hangs differently now. I know how difficult it is for the parents when the girls first come to convent. But you're just going to have to trust that she's in good hands. There will be a visiting day within three months you can see her then. Three months huh? Boy, that's long! Mr. Woolsey, you sound different today. Do you have a cold? [coughs] Cold? Yeah, a cold, flu, hemorrhoids, jock itch, the works! -I hope you feel better. -Thank you, Sister. God bless you. [sneezes] [conspicuous music] Hello, there. Good morning Sister. I like the way you handle that rake. -You do? -Yes. I can tell you're very skilled with long, stiff objects. I'm Sister Tiffany. I'm Max, Max Moolash. Pleased to meet you. Oh! Yes, yes. No doubt about it. These are the hands of a strong and masterful yet exquisitely sensitive man. Been here long Max? Oh no, just a few weeks. You? About 10 minutes. -You like it here, Max? -Shit yeah! Oh, I mean, sure do Ma'am. Well, I can see why. Here you are, a fine specimen of raw manhood, living amongst all these sex starved women. Well, I just want you to know, Max, that if you ever need anything, and I do mean anything, I'll be in room six. After all, we newcomers have to... stick together. Goodbye. Bye. Oh, God. I love this place. [rock music] [Jerry] Later, boys. Hey Jerry, isn't there some law against impersonating a priest? [laughing] How does he get away with this? We would never get away with this. -No kidding. -Babe alert, babe alert. How does he do this? Take notes. [mischievous music] [Jerry thinking] What a waste! [exclaims] [Max] Father, are you all right? Oh... Oh! Oh! Oh... -Oh. -Are you a gardener, father? My passion. And I've got to tell you, this is the finest specimen of Venus flytrap I've ever seen. Those are birds of paradise, father. Exactly. Where is everybody? Most of the Sisters are in vespers. Is there anything I can help you with? Oh! There they are. Guess I'll just go hobnob with the penguins. -Catch you later, uh... -Max. Father Goose. E pluribus unum. Good morning Father. I'm Sister Flavia. I'm Father Goose. That's Goose: it's Dutch. It's a derivative of the old English "Gooshy" meaning "servant of God," or "eater of lizards," depending on the context. I see. What brings you here today? Actually I was sent here by the Arch whooo... uh, dia... decesiwith. "Diocese"? He sent me over to interview your new group of pledges. To see how they are doing. Pledges? You mean postulants. We're calling them pledges now. It's a directive from you-know-who. It's very unusual. It's sort of an impulse thing. [laughs] That's very strange. No one from the outside has ever spoken with the postulants before. Well you know what they say, Sister: "If it weren't for change, we'd all stay the same." I think I better double check this. Tell you what, why don't you go on over to the rectory and meet the other priests and I'll call the archdiocese. [mischievous music] Anything new? Beano! [dramatically] Well, excuseme. Maybe His Majesty would like to get his own lunch. All right, gimme, gimme. Come on. Maybe we ought to call Cleeghorn. Beano, we don't have to call Cleeghorn every five minutes. He told us to keep him posted. Well, to hell with Cleeghorn! When I have myplan going, and I got myoperation going. Wewill have to answer to no-one. -Hey, what's this? -What? This on the sandwich. You got horsey sauce on this. -So? -So, I told you no horsey sauce. No horsey sauce don't mean yes horsey sauce. It does not mean maybe horsey sauce. No horsey sauce means flat out no horsey sauce! Have a cow, Stuey! Why don't you just take the horsey sauce off? Oh right! Like the horsey sauce taste won't still be on there anyway. Ah, gee, my knee! -[walkie-talkie crackles] -[Rowena] Stuey? -Yeah? -I've got everything set here. -Where is he? -He's still in the yard. Let me know as soon as he comes in. -Okay? -Wait. He's just gone in. Great! In and out. That's "over and out," Rowena! For you, maybe. Bye. Tramp. Max? [sexy music] Hi, sister. I'm having this little... problem here. Do you think you could give me a... hand? Sure. That damn radiator acting up again? You know, I fixed that thing at least... [weakly] Um... [gasps] Sister Tiffany! Call me... Tiff. W-What are you doing? I want you, Max. I crave your body. I knew the instant I saw you, that you were the only man for me. But you're a nun and I'm not even Catholic. So what. So you're married to God. God doesn't have a hairy chest like you do. But if he's the jealous type.., Oh, man! Forget about it. I'm quitting the order. Are you sure? I'm... positive. [Max weakly] Oh! Personally I see the mystical body as more of a pedagogic theoretical construct than a temporal actuality. Of course, of course. But... don't you believe that's it's palpable enough for us to participate in its divine puissance than on a quotidian level? [Father Flynn] Well that's what I would call into question. After all, how can we make it corporeal within the context of the relativist metaphysical climate in which we live today? [Father Gibson] I see your point, father. Tell me, what do you think, father... Goose? [Father Flynn] About the mystical body. [clears throat] Gee, boys, you've certainly bitten off a big one there. I mean, what do we mean by mystical, or body, for that matter? And I do get your point about divine puissance, I mean, who knows when you get enough of that. It... but... it's six of one or half dozen of the other. It's not whether you win or lose but how you look doing it. If we're talking mystical body in the Godly sense, I'd have to go with Christy Brinkley. Hmm. Food for thought. Oops! Time for your four o'clock mass, Father. Oh, I thought you were saying that today. Me? No, I have a meeting at 4:15, I thought you were scheduled. No Father, I'm teaching today. -[both] Hmm... -[dramatic music] [organ music] Dominus, domino, domini. [everyone] Amen! [clears throat] Anno domini, and a double dominer! [everyone] Thanks be to God. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to depart from the usual ceremony today. And I know that's kind of irregular, but even the good Lord is entitled to a little irregularity now and then! [laughs maniacally] So what I'd like to do is start out with a little spiritual Simon says. Everybody, stand up! [chortles] Simon didn't say. Simon says everybody stand up. Simon says put your hands together. Simon says Lord have mercy! [everyone] Lord have mercy! Okay, kneel down. You people? you're out. You. You're out. Gee, thanks, Tiff. No biggie. So, Max, what do you think of me? [laughs nervously] I like you a lot. I like you, too, Max. And it's not just because you're a stud muffin in the sack or anything. I mean because you're an honest man. And honesty really turns me on! It does? I've got an idea. Let's play Truth. Truth? We both tell some deep dark secret about ourselves that we've never told anyone before. Okay. Okay, I'll go first. Once I snuck a bag of nacho cheese tortilla chips into the convent and hid them from the other Sisters so that I could have them all to myself. [sighs] Okay. Now's your turn. But remember, honesty. Oh gee I don't think I could think of anything right now. Well of course you can. I mean, everybody has a big secret. I mean like, maybe when you... hid something from somebody? Hid? Yeah, like something that didn't belong to you. Oh jeez, I just remembered I forgot to sweep up the front room. Well, you didn't tell me your secret, Max. I can't think of one right now, maybe later. Bye! High-pitched fast voice over the phone. You're sure you've never heard of any Father Goose? [sighs] I see. Thank you very much [Jerry] Simon says, do the twist! [organ playing twist music] Simon says, flog yourself for sins! Ay, ay, ay! [all together] Ay, ay, ay! Simon says, on your knees and grovel before God. Simon says... [room goes quiet] Uh-oh. [everyone] Uh-oh. [dramatic organ music] Oh, Father Goose, can I talk to you for a minute? We'll have to make it fast. Will you tell me something, father? Is it okay for a priest to kiss a nun? Well, sure, as long as we don't get into the habit! How about a handyman? Can a handyman kiss a nun? What are you trying to tell me, Max? You see, father, oh... I had carnal relations with one of the Sisters and I want to find out if I'm going to hell. Why, Max, you devil! Oh! I knew it. Oh, God. -Tell me all about this. -I didn't mean to, Father. It was her idea. She told me she was quitting the order. Father, if you saw the Larry Csonkas on this chick-- She told you she was quitting the order? -Yes! -Then you'll be fine! -I am? -It's right there in the Bible. Cowboys 23, Line 15. "He who baffeth a nun who quitteth the order, shall not go to helleth." -Really? -You're fine. -Thank you, father, thank you! You don't know what a relief this is, 'cause I really like her a lot, and now she wants to talk about all my deep dark secrets. What deep dark secrets? Oh, I don't know if I should say, Father. We're protected by a priest-sinner privilege here. Well the truth of the matter is, father, I'm not really a handyman. No shit. I used to hang around with these jewel thieves, but I'm clean now. And they think I stole their rocks even though I didn't. -And now they're after me. -So? And this nun, she's really big on honesty and I'm afraid if I don't tell her she won't like me anymore, -But if I do tell her-- -Max, a word of advice: As the famous philosopher Little Richard once said, "Tutti frutti, oh rootie. Wop bop a loo bop a lop!" I think there's something in there for all of us. -But should I tell her? -Yes! -Oh, thank you, father. -Later, Max. [sighs] [lively music] [walkie-talkie crackles] [Rowena] But by this time tomorrow... Well, boys, let's just say I'll be all set to bag Max's marbles. In and out. [Cleeghorn] Yeah, to the left. To the left, ah. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's great. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Oh, hiya. Yeah, go ahead, go ahead. Get this one. Oh, that's it. I love it, that's good. Oh, yeah. A little lower. Oh, that's it. Get this one, get this one right there. That's it, yeah, file that. Excuse me, Mr. C. What do you want? Can't you see I'm working out here? Sorry, sir, but I thought you might wanna know that everything's taken care of. Rowena's in the convent, and she'll have more info for us by tomorrow. Fine, fine. Now get back to work. But remember, if you bozos blow this, and I gotta come down there to bail you out, I'll have your gonads for golf balls! -Thank you, sir. -Get outta here! That's it. A little lower. That's it. Get this one. Oh, yeah. That's it. Oh, yeah. So what are you guys doing tonight? Well, I thought maybe-- No dates again, huh? You got it. Don't worry about it. A little more practice, you'll be a couple of happening dudes. Like you, Jer? [sarcastic] Yeah, like that Father Goose thing. There's a real happening idea. You know, it's jut that attitude that keeps you two clowns in social Podunk Ville while I'm tossing dice on the Riviera. Oh, yeah, why couldn't you get in to see Monica? Because that Father Goose thing was just Phase 1. Now comes Phase 2. Yeah, next he's going in as the Pope. -[laughs] -No, it's better than that. Satisfaction guaranteed. [both] Uh-oh. [doorbell ringing] Hello. [door closes] I don't think I've ever seen you before, Sister. [high-pitched voice] I'm Sister Mary Voluptua from over at St. Betty's, and the girls sent me down here to meet your new postulants and present them with this little gift. Sort of as a welcome to the wonderful world of nundom! [laughs] Autographed pictures of Jesus. Immaculate inscription. [laughs] That's so sweet of you. I'll make sure that the postulants gets these. Actually, I kind of need to present it to them personally. Oh, that's not possible. Mother Superior would never, never allow that. Well there's a speech that goes along with it. -If I could just-- -No one is allowed to touch the postulants or see them. It's just a rule. Could you just ask her for me? Well, if you stay right here, I'll go get Mother Superior. Now. -Okie-dokie. -[bell tolls] [suspenseful music] [bell tolls] Good morning, sister. [muffled voices] [woman giggling] All right, Max. [giggling and kissing continues] [suspenseful music] [Sherry] A woman? -Just like my mom. -He does... -Hi Sister. -[shouts] Oh! I'm sorry. Are you all right? Oh yes. Just a little boo-boo. Can I get you some ice? No thanks. I take mine straight up. [laughs] Well, actually, I'm Sister Mary Voluptua from over at St. Betty's and we just like to sort of visit the new postulants at the local convents and say "Hi how are you, how's tricks?" [giggles] Oh how nice. I'm Catherine. -Sherry. -Monica. Well hi, hi, hi. What's that? Oh, this is just a little present from all of us to all of you. -[giggles] -Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you, Sister. Can we open it? Well sure. Enjoy! Sister, I don't understand. It's grace, silly. [all] Oh. Careful, it's escaping. [giggles] Oh! I don't want to interrupt you girls. Why don't you just go right ahead with what you were doing before. Actually, we were just changing. Oh. Go right ahead. Oh, I'm sorry Sister, it's just that you look very familiar to me. Well... People say I look like Ingrid Bergman in the Bells of St. Mary's. [laughs] So... How do you girls like convent life so far? Oh Sister, it's the best. I've never been happier since devoting my life to God. You're kidding. I mean, wow! It's, like, totally awesome! Wicked! How about you two? -It's... -Fine. That doesn't sound very enthusiastic. Are you sure? -Oh yeah. -Sure. Ah girls, don't be coy, now. I am here to serve. You can bare it all to me. Sister, to be honest, we've been struggling with some doubts. Ah... Tell me about them.

I really gotta go to the bathroom. Scout's honor. [clicks tongue] Okay. -But make it fast. -Three minutes. Okay. I can't believe you didn't recognize me. What? -[screams] -Monica! What is the matter with you? It's me. Jerry. Jerry? Kaminsky. Jerry Kaminsky? Jerry... [giggles] Jerry. [sighs] Monica, what are you...? I crave your strong, masculine hands over my eager, nubile body. This is hardly the time or the place. Oh, my God. I'm irresistibly attracted to you. No you're not. It's post hypnotic suggestion. -Listen-- -Come here. When I snap my fingers, you will no longer be irresistibly attracted to Jerry Kaminsky. Maybe a little bit. I want to make mad, passionate love with you. [dramatic music] [chiming] [organ music] Forgive me Lord for I am a sinner. Oh... No, I don't know where he is. Monica, tell me what's going on here. You don't belong in this convent. Why did you come here? To give lifelong service to the Lord. Come on Monica, that's not you talk-- Oh, boy. Somewhere in there someone must have given her another post hypnotic suggestion. Come here you studly sex machine. Listen Monica. This is all a mistake, I have to get you out of here. -[knocking] -[Sister Flavia] Hello. -Who is in there? -[sighs] Shit. Just a moment, Sister. Listen, don't say anything, not a word. Okay? Please? Oh. I thought I heard voices. No Sister, that was just me. I was speaking in tongues. [sighs] Have you seen a nun running around here that calls herself Sister Mary Voluptua? Oh, um, well... was she tall, dark eyebrows, big hands, funny voice and kind of ugly? -That's her. -No, Sister. [sighs] You check the front room. I'll talk to the others. Tiff, it's like this. No, no. Tiff, it's like this. Max? What's going on? Nothing Sister. I was just... Hey, wait a minute. I've never seen you here before. How do you know my name? Well I had this vision last night and there were angels singing and people dancing... Oh to hell with it. Look, it's me, all right? Father Goose? A switch hitting priest. I'm not even a priest. You're not a priest? It's a long story Max. Does this mean I'm going to hell after all? How should I know? Ask a priest. Oh damn. I was just going to tell her my secret. Your nun friend, cute little blonde with great Winnebagos? Yeah, why? I think she's trying to pull something over on you friend. -You're telling me. -No, I saw her talking to this guy on a walkie talkie yesterday. She's getting ready to bag your marbles. You're lying. Tiff loves me. She would never do something like that to me. Look, I'm just trying to help you out. What is the fastest way out of here? Probably running. Get your big, mega-hunk ass over here and tell me a big, whopper truth. [laughs] [suspenseful music] Well? Oh! I think I reinjured my old war wound. War wound? My thyroid is flaring up again. That's not where your thyroid is! That's where mine is. They had to move it. Oh! Wait a minute! Gotta go, gotta go. Bye. [Clemmons] All right Your Holiness. We'll make preparations right away. Well? He wants to visit some parishes, mingle with the common folk. What on earth for? Oh you know. The people's Pope and all that. So what do we do? We visit some parishes. So what's the story? Have you given up on Monica or what? What happened to this grand plan of yours? Phase two was a smashing success. Now it's time for phase three. [Theo] Which is? All I have to do is go in there and de-hypnotize her. If you two banana heads play your cards right, I might do you a favor in the bargain. Oh really? Two of Monica's friends are having some serious doubts. You guys come in there with me and you'll turn those doubts into dates. [Zoomer laughs] Nuns? [Theo] No way. [Jerry] Fore! [glass shatters] Sorry officer. [snoring] Hey, Beano. Beano, wake up! Hey! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Dude! Come on, let's go. Come on. -[both grunt] -Beano! As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Amen. Sherry? Oh. Amen. What were you thinking about? Oh God, heaven, guardian angels, the usual stuff. Good for you, Sherry. I'm setting this alarm for a one hour nap. Okay? It's not true. I was thinking about Mel Gibson. I lied about it. Sherry, take it easy. It's perfectly normal. Really. I don't know. Sherry, it is perfectly normal. Why, just a while ago I was thinking of Menachem Golan. You were? Mm-hm. So if you get any lustful thoughts, just say a bunch of Hail Marys until it passes. It works for me. Okay. Thanks, Monica. Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee .... I don't believe this Kaminsky. This is utterly Looney Tunes. Cool your jets Elmer Fudd. Everything is going to be just fine. I don't know, I kind of like it. Let's go. [comical music] Hiya Maxey. Hi Mr. Cleeghorn. Just up, Mr. Cleeghorn. Get him! [whispers] They're asleep. [whispers] Great! This is going to be a fun date. [whispers] I got an idea. We can wake them up Shh! Monica Woolsey, this is the Holy Ghost speaking. I have a message for you. You have made a big mistake. I repeat, a big mistake. [comical music continues] When I snap my fingers, you will wake up and you will no longer have any desire to be a nun. Do you understand, Monica? Good. And you'll still crave Jerry Kaminsky's body but not until later when I say so. [snickering] One, two, three... Hi Jer, what are you doing in a funky outfit like that? -And where the hell am I? Shh! [whispers] Jerry, what is going on here? Take it easy, babe. You just ran off and joined a convent, no big deal. Oh, yeah. Oh no... Hello Sisters. What's going on? -Ta-da! -[screaming] Shh! Shh! Girls, relax, they're perfectly harmless. Thanks a lot. So I hear you girls are having a couple doubts. I don't believe this. If Sister Flavia walks in the door we're dead. So we can have a good time until then, right? We're not allowed to have fun. Wait a minute. Hold it. Think about this. Three guys dressed in habits walk into our room while we're sleeping and try to pick us up. It's too weird, right? No kidding. Okay, so that can mean only one thing. We're dreaming. -Dreaming? -[Catherine] Yeah. And if we're dreaming, we can do whatever we want and who's gonna know? Sounds good to me. -Let's party. -All right! -Shit! -Now what? I'm calling Cleeghorn. You stay here and watch the place. To the monastic life, a hard habit to break. -Here, here! -Wait! -What? -I left the cheese in the car. -Oh man. -It'll take a minute. Hang on. Hurry up, would you? [laughter] Get her a couple more drinks before Jerry gets back. [grunts] I'm sorry Sister. If anybody asks, you did not see me. Gotta run. See ya. [suspenseful music] -[static] -Rowena? [radio static] Yeah? Have you seen our friend Max lately? I told you I'm working on it. [Beano] Oh really? Then you must know he tried to get away. What! He tried to escape but luckily we chased him back into the convent. But you must find him fast or Cleeghorn is going to roast our gooseberries. I'm on it. [Beano] Weren't you going to sign off? Yeah. Out and in. Right. Over and out. [suspenseful music] Holy shitski. [sinister laugh] Alright, attention all morons. Because of a certain pair of incompetent horseheads that managed to tip off Moolash that we found him, I am forced to invade this house of religious order to get him. Is there any questions? If you raise a thumb so help me I'll bite it off. [rock music] You guys are not going to believe what I found in the hallway. -[gasps] -Wow! -Do you know what this means? -Oh my God! What? They're fake, I mean, why would diamonds be hanging around the hall of the convent? Yeah, they're fake, you guys. Come on, we could wake up any minute here. You're right. [thud] Dope. If it's not too complicated for your brain to understand, I want you to find the phone lines and cut them. Alright, you go round everybody up. I want to snoop around a little bit. [frustrated sigh] Max? Max! [rock music] You know... This is awfully real for a dream. Oh, come on. You're dancing the limbo with three guys in habits. How real could it be? [laughter] Whoa. I guess you're right. Hold it! Max told me he used to be involved with jewel thieves. -So? -So maybe those diamonds -were real. -[grunts] -[thud] -We've gotta get them back! [Zoomer] Who's Max? Oh! Lyle. Well if ain't Sister Mary Airhead. Look, I've done everything you told me to do. You stupid little bimbo. You screwed up and I'm pissed off. I am not a bimbo, Lyle. Hey, I tell you what you are and what you aren't. Now you better find Moolash fast or you're going to be one dead bimbo. Get! I said get! -[Sister Gabriel screams] -Get out here! -Come out here into the hallway. -What do you want? Who are you? Don't you put your crummy hands on me. -You don't scare me. -Get going here. Max, what the hell -is going on here? -Shh! You're a bad boy, my friend. I thought you were out of the hot rocks business. I am, I just kept this one little batch because it's the only way I could pay for my law school. Plus my mama needs this operation real bad. -Max-- -It's the truth! What could be keeping him? I hope he's all right. Good heavens, what's going on here Catechism class. Now get with them. Look, I can't be jawing with you right now. They found me, they're here, and they're gonna chop me up -for bug food. -Who is? The guys I work for! Now, if they get ahead of these stones, they're just gonna sell them for drugs again. Now go away. Please. Here. Hey, you nun. Hey. You seen Max Moolash around? Hey, you ain't no nun. Yes I am. Cut the bullshit. You're a guy! Shows what you know. We're coed now. What kind of place is-- Hey, what have you got behind your back? -Nothing. -Let me see. Let me see the other one. [stutters] Let me see! Hey! Let me see! Let me see! [grunting] Both of them! Ah! Hey! [grunting] Hey! Hey! Get back here, whatever you are! Hey! Alright you people. What the hell's going on in here? Yeah, what the hell is going on in here? Oh my God! [sobs] Oh God, I knew this was going to happen. Now we're going to be executed. Zoomer, get a hold of yourself! What do you got now, homos in habits? That's what I'd like to know. You see, Sister, we were just... Never mind. The rest of you get on over there with them. Come on, come on. Now... who knows where Max Moolash is? [dramatic music] -[sinister laugh] -[screams] Nuts! Jeez, that was a tough chick. [grunts] Get that guy, he's got the stones! -Huh? -You idiot, go after him! Oh! Maxey... Max... Come on. I know you're out here somewhere. Oh! Max! What the hell are you doing? What does it look like? Max, where are the diamonds? I don't know, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. I was just doing my job. Don't take it personally. You're just using me! I really liked you a lot, and I thought you liked me. I do like you, Maxey! Come on, just tell me where the diamonds are. I told you, I don't know. I gave them to some guy in a nun suit. What? [frustrated sigh] Alright, let's go. Come on, Maxey! I don't want to have to use this. Now go! Go ahead and shoot me, I don't have anything to live for anyway. [music continues] Sir, obviously we don't know where Max is. You might as well let us go. We stay here until somebody talks. Well, what do you want him for, anyway? He's our fourth for bridge. None of your business! We're wasting time. And as for your three, you have some explaining to do. You know what? I don't like this dream anymore. Me either. It's too real. Let's pinch ourselves and wake up. -Alright. -No! [both] No, you don't want to do that. -Why not? -Because the best part -is yet to come. -Which part? The, um... The Spanish fly part. -What? -I told you people to stop the yik-yaking. [gunshots] Sir... I don't know where Max Moolash is. But I'm sure if we put our heads together we can come up with something. [both laugh] Kind of cute for a nun, aren't you? [both laugh] Hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. [grunts] -Ah-ah! -[both laugh] Naughty, naughty, naughty. You are a very, very naughty boy. You are very, very, very sleepy. Your eyelids are very, very, very heavy. Sleep, sleep, sleep... [sniffs] Nice try, sweet cakes. Now get over there and shut up! What are you looking at? Come on, Maxey. Please! I'm in deep enough doodoo as it is. If I don't take you to Lyle, he's going to kill me. Good. It'd serve you right. [gasping] I can't pretend any longer. It's true. I hate Lyle. It's you I want, Maxey. I adore you. I didn't want it to happen, but I couldn't help myself. Huh? Let's run away, you and me. We can leave town and move to Alaska, where Lyle could never find us. You could go to law school. And I could stay home and bake gingersnaps. You're making it up. No, I swear, Maxey! Oh come on, we gotta hurry. You really mean it? Cross my heart and hope to die. Well, how do I know for sure? [romantic music] -Tiff! -[sighs and laughs] [dramatic music] [grunting] [grunting] [Cleeghorn] Go that way! [gunshot] [gunshot] -Hey! -[gunshot] Ow! Nothing's happening. Maybe you're only dreaming that you're dreaming. Yeah, maybe you're not even sleeping at all, Maybe you're in a movie. Girls, look, you might as well know. We're not dreaming, this is all very real. You mean... that's a real gun that guy has? And these guys really snuck into our room? And we danced with them? [Sherry] Oh my God. You scuzzball. How dare you try to pick up a nun! -[grunts] -You should be ashamed! -You pervert! -[gasping] [yelling] Ha! [crewman] Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I help you with something, buddy? [grunting] [groans] [moaning] -Ha! -[grunts] [repeated shouts] Ow! [yells] Dude, I think you're in the wrong movie. [in English] What did you say? Oh... you are right. I'm sorry, you guys. Oh, by the way, which way to Burbank? I think it's over this way. You know, Bruce, we really, really should do lunch sometime. I will have my girl call your girl. -Okay? -Seasons change, don't you ever. -Later, dude. -[gunshot] You know something? You look awfully familiar to me. Will you sit down, please? I know I've seen you someplace before... Stuart McRiff! Huh? Sixth grade, St. Jude Elementary. Sister... Flavia! [Sister Flavia] You little devil! I knew you'd come to no good! -[Stuey] Now wait a minute-- -I ought to spank your hiney! -[screams] -[Stuey shouting] [Sister Flavia] How dare you bring -a gun in here! -I'll be good! [Sister Flavia] Wait till your mother hears about this! [gurgling] What is this place? The Convent of the Blessed Virgin. Let's go in. With all due respect, Your Holiness, we've already visited four parishes today. And it's getting rather late. Come, come! It's never too late for God's work. [comical music] -[Cleeghorn] Freeze! -[bodyguard] No, you freeze! [Cleeghorn] Who the hell are you? -Never mind, who are you? -Police. That guy's a wanted jewel thief. -What! -Grab him, quick! Wait a minute, he's no cop! And you're no priest! He's the thief! Ask to see his badge. -What the devil? -Alright, nobody move. You two guys with the guns... Drop them! Or this guy gets it. My good man, do you know who that is? Nah. Oh God. No, but you're close. Some rabbi. So what! He's not a rabbi. He's the Holy Father the Pope. Get outta here! If he's the Pope, how come he's wearing a yarmulke? That's not a yarmulke. Oh yeah? Then what is it? It's the papal beanie. Holy shit. I'm sorry, Your Lordship. Popeship. Popeworship. Quite alright. One Adam. Rampart. How does this thing work? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Let's be reasonable here. Dance, suckers! -[yelling] -That's showing them Sher! Let's get out of here! [grunting] To think we were having doubts. [Sherry] I'd forgotten what scum men are. -[panting] -Dude... I think we need to reexamine our approach to women. I'm out of here. What? [romantic music] Alright, here's the deal. Walk up real nice and smooth, like. And give me those rocks! Everybody else, don't move. Let's go, chop chop. Come on, come on! Lyle, look who I found. Rowena, can't you see I'm tied up here? But I thought you wanted Moolash! I don't care about Moolash. The stones are here, you stupid bimbo! Lyle, I told you, I'm not a bimbo! Shut up, you bimbo! No, you shut up! What are you doing? I've taken your poppycock long enough. I love Max and we're going away together. Ah, Tiff! It's Rowena, honey. Oh, Rowena! What? Everybody's gone cuckoo around here! Drop your gun and let go of that rabbi! No way! Did you get 'em, boss? Whoops. Guess not. Beano! Grab Rowena, she's turning against us. -Huh? -Just do it! Guess you'd better drop it, honey. Make my day. Okay. Just drop the stones on the ground. -Move, move! -[police sirens] Hey! Hey! Aw, come on! [grunting] Give me my rocks! Are you alright, sir? Yes. Yes, I think so. You're a very brave young priest. It was the least I could do for my main holy man. [laughing] Horseheads and bimbos! Oh God! Here you go, Exhibit A. [Cleeghorn yelling] You men are very lucky. Very lucky. That's the Cleeghorn gang. We've been after them for months. Well, you know, we had a little help from you-know-who. I'll testify for you, Max. You! You have a lot of nerve coming back here you phony baloney! "Father Goose" indeed. Oh, and I bet all the rest of these imposters are friends of yours, too! Don't be angry, Sister. He's actually a fine young man. Who's this bozo? Really, Sister! This is the Holy Father. Oh, well, isn't that nice. Holy Father indeed! Well, it isn't often we get a visit from the Pope these days. Well, Pope this! [Pope] Oh! [Sister Flavia] What do you think I am, some kind of an idiot? The only thing "holey" about you is your underwear! I'm sorry, Your Holiness. I had no idea she was demented. [Sister Flavia] Let go of me! Let go of me! -Are you alright? -Yes, yes. Well, my son, you saved my life. I would like to do something for you. Oh, it's not necessary for you to do anything for me. Nonsense! One kind act deserves another. [stutters] I don't know if there's anything -you could do for me, I mean-- -Come now. I know there's something I could do for an outstanding young priest like yourself. Hm... Maybe there's one thing. [triumphant music] [all laugh and cheer] Monica! Jerry! I'm gonna kill ya! I'm gonna kill ya! Ah... bimbo! Hey, Max! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
