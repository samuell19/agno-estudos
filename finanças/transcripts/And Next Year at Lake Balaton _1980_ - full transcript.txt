NEXT YEAR AT LAKE BALATON Adapted from the novel “But Then I'm No Yogi" by Joachim Walther Directed by Herrmann Zschoche - Would you like a boat like that? - No. - Why not? - Expensive. - And if you had the money? - Still no. Why not? Not my world. I'm not a sporty guy. What kind of guy are you? - Havin' fun, huh? - Hey, old man! - You're... impossible! - Halftime. Exactly. I'm an impossible guy. Inez! Inez!! Why'd you really leave home? My father annoyed me. Going on about things like: When I was your age, I walked 30 miles for 10 lbs of potatoes. You've got it too good. We put too much into youth. You have no interests. Just music. That's how it was, until I'd had it. My parents talk nonsense too. They have their opinions. They can't help it. My father is a grumpy person, but oh well... What about your mom? Oh, she always bothered me with her sayings too. Once, when a girl in my class came over, she gave me a lecture on relationships with girls and gave me a book about it. Very discreet. You can be with a girl without it being something. They think of all kinds of things. - You're so different from others. - How so? Just different. I can actually talk to you. Well? Not bad. We'll camp some place where there're no people. Not at campsites, every day somewhere new. But we'd need a camping permit. Not for such a small tent. That's what you think! The police'd chase you off. Or they'd arrest you. Where do we want to go? - To... India? - You're crazy. Fine, then to the Baltic Sea. You always have such ideas, Johnny. What is going on here?! I don't believe this! Use of an exhibit object is not permitted. You've gone crazy. Leave immediately... Easy, Gramps. It's our tent. We're allowed to try it out, right? - No. - Yes, then it'll be both of ours. Well... Thanks. Hey, Johnny? I've never been camping. I won't mind, even if it rains. We'll stay in the tent until it stops. The rain'll beat on the roof and we'll... Hey, Johnny, how tan do you get? Like chocolate? Or a latte? I think I'll never be as tan as you. My stomach is as white as the moon. Let me see. Inez! Excuse me, I didn't mean to disturb you. Please pick up three 100 Watt bulbs after school tomorrow, OK? I'll be home later. Jonas staying here overnight? Should I wake you? - No, I gotta go. - Why? You can stay here. No, he was just leaving. Well, then good night. - Well then, I'll go... - Take care. OK then, I'm going... You should eat an apple at night. For the vitamins. It's better than all your beer. Are you already asleep? Heinz... I have a wonderful idea. Let's all go to Bulgaria. You and me. Inez and Jonas. As a graduation gift. The boy starts his military service in the fall. Before then, they can have a memorable experience. - Not a chance. - Don't be like that. - The whole thing's bullshit. - They mean well. And when you want to do something different, they treat you like a criminal and discipline you. But we can do what we want there! But not with mom and dad. And all behind my back. I didn't know. They wanted to surprise us. Doesn't work for me. You know, it's impossible to talk reason with you! What do you have against my parents? They never did anything! Get lost and get spoiled. Oh hello there, dear! Go on in. - I'm sorry. - Never mind, you're right. - No, it was mean of me. - It was my fault. Nice you're here. I like you, Johnny. You know we've known each other for 5 months? Yes. I don't mind if we go to Bulgaria. Whatever you want is fine. Your parents won't bother us. We'll do what we want. I've never been to a real ocean. In the evening we can go to the beach or go dancing... Go on in. Jonas is there. Hey, people! Don't let us disturb you. Don't be upset. We just want to play records. - We had a plan, right? - Just hurry. Well, then. - There a crossword puzzle? - No idea. I've gotta go. Public facility for water lovers? - I'd say: pool. - Nice. Stay a while. No, I have stuff to do. 'Bye, boys. - Take care. - 'Bye. What'd you say? Let's hit the road, hitchhike. Guys in Brigade 3 said they nearly got to Turkey last year. Had a terrific time. Andy says you can dive there, like the Mediterranean. Like Andy knows about diving in the Mediterranean. OK, what do you say? No, I'm going with Inez. - Where is he? - How should I know? Man! Hurry. Ready! Taking the train is so nice! You can see things. And there's time to chat. Say, Jonas, why didn't you want to get your diploma? Inez told me you left even though you got really good grades. Besides, the train's cheaper. Flying costs 5 times more. But Heinz... the important thing is we don't get there in a flash. It's easier to adjust to the different climate, to settle in. Thank you. Let's drink to the trip, the lovely weather, - and let's be less formal. - Oh yes. That's Irene. I'm Heinz. - Cheers! - Cheers. As long as we're this far... - there's another matter. - Let it be. It's about appearances, so we have no problem with the rooms. You two want a room alone, right? - Heinz, give it here. - It doesn't have to be now. A surprise. Heinz! Come on, open it! Well, what do you say? They're grandma and grandpa's. Doesn't mean you have to marry. Engagement rings! It's just because of people. So there are no dumb questions. For the sake of convenience. We only meant well, if you don't want to... Not me, count me out! Come on, we're getting off. Jonas! Johnny! Johnny! Please stay! You finally did it with your constant fussing! As if I were a little kid! We only agreed to come because of you! We'd rather have gone alone! If only you knew how much you annoy me! Why do you always meddle in my affairs? Take care of your own stuff! I've had it! If it were up to me, we'd be at Branim Lake now. It's always the same with you and your interests. You've never understood me, or our child. I've suffered it my entire life. If you'd just say one word, if you'd only try to help sort things out. - Stop it. - Yeah, you just want your peace. I wonder who our marriage even matters to. - Waiter. - Yes? - A bottle of vodka. - Yes, vodka. - Panonia Express boarding! - Health magazine "For You", as well. - These too? - Yes. - Caution! Train is leaving! - 1.10 please. Thank you. Where are we traveling? To where, tell me? To find the summer! That's where we go! So you know what you should do to make a better life! 3, 4. Little lady, want a ride with me? Yes, if possible... Then let's be off, little lady, let's go! Where to, young lady? - To Bulgaria, actually. - Perfect. I'm going there too. Sorry, fuel tap! Otto Schmiedel. - What? - My name's Otto Schmiedel. Ah. Irene Moldenschütt. I drive down every year. To Kavazite. You? To Nesebar. Perfect! We'll drive by it, it's on the way. Are you OK? Where do you want to go? I don't care. You should know where you want to go. - Where you are going? - Towards Prague. Good. I'll go with you. - Not in a good mood, huh? - No. - Have some trouble? - Yeah. - Woman trouble? - Well, yeah. With women, there's always trouble. You can't rely on them. I have it all behind me. Chin up, kid! It's over. I'm done! She have another guy? - No, with her parents in Bulgaria. - Oh... well, kid, she'll come back. Not to me! It's over. - Is this your suitcase? - Yes. - This one too? And the bags? - Yes. Let me see this suitcase, please. - Show me everything, OK? - OK. - You're traveling alone? - Yes. - Alone? - Yes. Then come with me please. Papa! Papa! What an idiot! Sexist! Bastard. Prick! What's wrong, girl? - You bastard, get lost! - Jeez... not me...! - I'm not the bad one, girl. - You pig! - You're crazy. Screw you! - Oh, good heavens... Can't help her. She's nuts. - Take care and thanks! - Ahoy! Thanks. I'm Jonas. Shireen. Come sit. - Where're you from? - The Netherlands. You? Berlin. - Where are you going? - I'm on the road. - Just like that? - Yeah, with my tent. - Interesting. - And you? Through Bulgaria, Greece, and finally to India. - Why India? - Why not? Sure, why not? Just a short trip to India. I want to learn about Tantras. Is that a type of animal? No, they're Buddhists. A thousand-year-old sect. They reject desire and self-affliction. The wise ones remove passion with passion. When you satisfy passion, it is no longer there. You enjoy the world of senses, but aren't tainted by it. You can pick the Lotus bloom without touching the water. You have pretty hair. How far do you want to go today? - To Budapest. - To Budapest? So? Shall we go? One more vacation day gone. You're just too soft, my friend, too decent. It'd be nice to be in a row boat fishing. But no, we had to saddle ourselves with this boy. It's normal. Not even his parents can handle him. They know better than to take him on vacation. As if I didn't have enough problems with my own daughter. And then this woman! Nothing but nonsense in her head! She'll drive us all into disaster. - Would you mind... - One moment. Thank you. Shall we try finding each other with our eyes closed? See? That's secret attraction. Get in and stay quiet. You're my brother. - Are you driving to Brno? - Yeah, in that direction. Hey, what are you doing here? Man, what are the chances? I'll be damned. - Hi. - Hi, Rainer. Guys, we should drink to this. - You've got that right. - Count me in. Do it! Move. - Great! - Now, now, now! - Delicious. - Better than pilsner. He's stopping! Let's get off! - What about the beer? - Just get off! What's trump? - Diamonds. - OK. I can't get over the fact that we all met. Was the hand of God. Like in movies, only no one believes it. Hey, it's your turn! - What's up with you? - Oh, nothing. Yeah, sure. Women. If you'd listened to us, then nothing would've happened. Let's have some fun, just us men. Ugh, I had that... Nearly dry. Still stinks like a brewery. Alright, people, I've got to eat something. - Hurry up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah... Vivarna... It's a wine bar. - Can you get beer too? - Of course! It's not like back home. Beef and dumplings. A house specialty. Give me that. I have to see for myself. - Hurry it up. - We'd like to eat. - Hey... hurry. - Just a minute. Great, guys. Now we won't get anything. I want dumplings with beef. How much money do we have? - I don't have any. - Great! Big help you are. - 30. - That's enough. We'd like 3 dumplings with beef and... 3 beers. Now what do you say? Great service here! Not like at home. - Cheers! - Cheers, buddy! Hey, boys. Excuse me, boys. To your health! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Are you East or West...? - East Germany. Go ahead. Bon appetit! Thanks. Where will you sleep tonight? You have an apartment? Not really. We have a tent. If you want, you can stay at my place. I have plenty of room. Yeah, OK. Alright. First, finish eating. - Good, right? - Great. Come on in. Please. Have a seat. Please. What would you say to a little nightcap... A good Slivovitz. Yes? Please, have a seat. Every clock is a person. When it runs, everything is fine. When it doesn't, it's bad. Then he's dead. The person. To good health! You know... this is my first wife. She had bad luck in childbirth. The clock stopped 40 years ago. This one 20 years. When my second wife died. You know, sometimes, I wind up all the clocks. And when they tick, I converse with my dead... as if they were sitting here. And what's with that one? It stopped a week ago... though I'd wound it the day before. Who is it? Katya, my daughter. My only... And... is she really... ...um, dead? Is the clock ticking or not? Why would it stop? But if she were dead, you would have heard. It's not so simple. She went off to Australia. The clock stopped running. Katya is dead. Sleep well. Blankets. Pillows. That's a bunch of rubbish, right? - But if he believes it... - Yeah... - Hey, what're you doing? - Be quiet. - Can you put it back together? - Leave it alone. Hold that light. Guys, a little quiet. - Higher. - Like this? Hi, girls. How're things? Lousy. We've been here over 2 hours. Completely clear. You're exactly two too many. Think about it. Three beauties huddled together, A driver thinks he doesn't stand a chance. Logical? Logical. Where're you headed? To Budapest. There and back. Us too, girls. See how we'll manage. We'll make mixed doubles. You with material appeal. We as bodyguards. That way we'll all get a ride and your chastity is safe. I suggest, you each choose one of us. It's a one-time offer. What's wrong, girls? Evelyn. I don't care. Main thing is that we get out of here soon. OK, throw the dice. That's Rainer, talented mechanic from Berlin. That's Jonathan. I'm Kuss, called "the big Kisser." So you know whose clutches you're in. You? - Fränze... - Actually Franziska. - And Evelyn. I'm Grille. - Well, let's go. First Rainer and Jonas. Should we say with... Evelyn. And one, two, three... Rock smashes scissors, so Rainer with Evelyn. Now the two of us. For Grille. One, two, three... Paper covers rock. I'm with Grille. You're with Fränze. Wait a second! Where'll we meet? Tomorrow at 8 am. The steps in front of Parliament. Early in the morning? Why? Tomorrow morning at 8, OK? Ahoy! Where do you want to get out? In the city center, if that works. My God, you can never stop here. - Man, how chaotic. - Have you ever been here? No, first time here. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! It's a roundabout! Forget it. Oh well, we'll just turn around. I don't care. - Look, the Danube! - Looks like sludge. And people say, it's always blue. Hey, leave my stuff, man. - Thanks again. - Take care, kids. Goodbye. Is this the right address? Where'd you get it? From a friend. It has to be here. No Jósef Kovács. - Good evening. - Evening. - Where is Kovács Jósef? - Kovács? No idea... Sorry, no Kovács Jósef here. - You're German? - Yes. - One night? - Yes. - István. - Franziska. - István. - Jonas. - One night stay? - Yes. Please. My wife will make... - So, good? - Very good. - Goodnight. - Night. Goodnight. - Let's leave the light on. - Yeah. - Hey, are you warm? - I'm fine. - Quit that! - Fine. Just because we're in a bed, doesn't mean it'll happen. Sorry. I just think you're really nice. - Are you crazy? - That was an accident. Piece of crap. Fine, I'll sleep over there. Hey, I know what you must think of me. We hardly know each other. I know you pretty well. You know, on the first day... I like you, but... How much time do you usually need? It varies. It depends. But... - ...at least a couple of weeks. - Or better still, 5 months. Why 5 months? That's when things get decided. Really? It doesn't have to be 5 months. We could talk a little. My parents live in Berlin, and I'm an apprentice in Greifswald. Good. Every mile away from parents is priceless. - And your parents? - They live in Berlin too. - And your father? - Yeah, him too. He's in Berlin. You'd rather sleep now, huh? Yeah, I'm tired. We can get to know each other tomorrow. Well then, sleep well. Goodnight. - Where's Evelyn? - Gone, as you can see. - Talk. - Not a lot to say. We rode in a BMW. Evelyn stuck with the swank... off into the hotel. - Why didn't you stay? - Nah. - Where'd you sleep? - Went walking. And you? It was fine. Where's your friend Kuss? It's already 8:15. Down there. GONE TO NESEBAR. KUSS AND GRILLE. I've had enough. Haven't washed in 2 days. Here, eat something. No thanks, not hungry. We won't get far if we waste time. I could stay here another day. Then we won't make it to Bulgaria for this vacation. - You just wanna meet Inez. - Who's Inez? His girlfriend. She went ahead to Bulgaria. Oh? - It smells awful. - It's sulfur. - Try with "LOI." - "LOI." See? Yup, crossword puzzles enhance general knowledge. Inez! Inez! Inez. Excuse me! It was a mistake. Sorry... excuse me. - Multi-day special event? - Festival. Man, you know a lot! Do you do crosswords too? No, I study chemistry. Hello! Little brother! Oh, Shireen. With little brothers there's only trouble. Sorry. A couple of friends were in the back of the truck. No matter. Oh well. - Want to meet the others? - What others? No idea. Poles, Austrians... East Germans too, I think. Stay calm, man. This kind of turtle's not for soup. Isn't it beautiful? I'm sleeping outside tonight. You? Might be cold at night. If you want, you can share my tent. - No. - I didn't mean it like that. You'll catch cold. And the mosquitoes... There aren't any mosquitoes here. - What are you? - What? When were you born? Which month? - Oh, in June. - Then you're Gemini. You're really into this stuff? Not exactly. I'm interested in Tantras. It was said: "I visited altars and pilgrimage sites on my journeys, but never found such a holy altar as my own body... that cleanses the senses, like a bird taking flight from, then returning to a ship." That's good, with the bird. I feel like that most of the time. Just, with the purified senses... The Tantras make a circle... the mandala. Around the circle they place flower garlands, incense, bells, symbols. Then a yogini lies on the floor, and a yogi on top of her. After their union, they are blessed by the master. That's why you want to go to India? - It's great here. - Yes, like in Switzerland. But those mountains are higher and still have snow in summer. Sorry. 5 Levs? 15... Ha, 15! Unbelievable. It's lovely here. Everything is so real. I feel the people are unspoiled. Simple and humble. Content with what nature gives them. Then why'd grandma want so much money for a melon? You really think they don't want more? I could live here. I'd be happy. Yeah, could be... it's romantic for you. Exotic. Exotic is always good. Stay, not for 3 days, but forever, then you'll see differently. If we leave early tomorrow, we'll make it to Romania. Haha, Dear Otto... Learned that at sea. - You were a sailor too? - Yes. "Blessed are you, little one, from the branches of trees of a small drink enthralled, singing... as a King should live." Goethe, "To the Cicada". Sometimes I think my life is the same, but with no helping finger to point the way. Hey! Who do you think you are? God's gift to earth? Or what? Well, come on. I need your things. That's not enough. I need half from each of us. Those too! Come on. When you enter the mandala, you'll see no one. Just me. I don't know... So what? Come. On this meadow there'll be a small temple when we depart. Come. I can't. This is the first time this has happened. Honestly. It doesn't matter. Hello. Passport. Here you go. - Tourists? - Yes. From the Netherlands. Visa? - India? - Yes. Thank you. Passport. - Photo? - Yes. But that's me! Yes? Here are my ears. I'd like to go in now. Hey, he doesn't want me to cut my hair does he? No way. Not before my military service. Come with me. - What're you doing? - Come on. - What's this? - Head down. Well? - Man... - So lovely. Happy now? - Is it OK? - Yes. What now? I don't get it. What am I supposed to do? Shakes his head but says yes. Something's different here. Excuse me, do you know where Hotel Nesebar is? Hotel Nesebar? No. Thanks. Excuse me, is there a Hotel Nesebar? On the beach. All right, already. Photo? Photo camel? Please. - Take one of yourself. - Miss? Fine! I'm sick of running around like an idiot. The sacred things of wealth. The whole world will be enslaved by the luster of things. No one understands his true nature. You're right. We're looking for a place in shadows. A lonely place where no one is, and there we can dwell. - Look. Beautiful, right? - Yeah, sure. Close your eyes and look into the sun. First is darkness, then red flecks with green. When I close them tightly, it's red and yellow. You do it. I'm getting all lightheaded. You're too restless. Sit with me and try it. Look toward the sea and you'll grow calm. You must become calm. Do not celebrate if you win something. You must not be angry when you lose something. Don't let ridicule hurt you or praise influence you. Do not reject pleasure. You must learn to be at peace with yourself. First I'm going swimming! I'll dunk you! It's full of mussels. - Aren't you eating? - Yeah, I am. Here. - Want a sip? - Uh-huh. This is how life should be. Yeah, one could live like this. Give me your watch. Hey! We have sun, moon and stars. - I like you. - I like you, too. Bulgaria... vacation? Not romantic. Hey, look! Man, Inez. I can't get over it! Still know who I am? - Kuss! - Yeah, and Grille. It's OK now. I bet these are worth something! I have one too! Hey, you'll never guess... someone chucked their watches. I have one too. Hey! That's Johnny's watch. He's got to be here somewhere. Johnny? Who is it? Bastard! Sleep with other girls! I'll let you have it! - You're being crazy! - Get lost! Excuse me, is this your watch? Hare Rama. I'm very calm. Hare... Girls! Stop it! Help! Leave him alone! - What's going on here? - You idiot! We'll show you! We didn't do anything! Kuss! Come over here. Johnny! Johnny! Police! Let's scram. Bye. All the best! Bye! - Passport. - One minute. - No camping allowed. 5 Levs. - Yeah, OK. Bulgaria. Not allowed. 5 Levs. Heinz! There you are, my darling. This is Herr Schmiedel from Leipzig. He gave me a ride. My husband, as you know. What's that? I'm not stopped. The woman just met her husband. 5 Levs. - Makes no sense. - No you're not paying. We will. - Come on! Here you go. - Thank you. But Heinz, it's Herr Schmiedel... - It's fine. Do you still need help? - No. Thank you for everything. - When you're in Berlin, visit us. - Sure. What? You don't know where Inez is? - I thought she was with you. - Why with me? Come on, you have to know. She was traveling with you. Didn't you look after her? What do we do now? Can't you answer me? You don't know where she is... But you don't say anything. I can't understand. We have to do something. We can't just unpack here when we don't know where she is. Oh God... - Where's my suitcase? - Gone. - What do you mean? - Gone. Disappeared... - Stolen. - What? Are you serious? All my things. I've nothing to change into! Couldn't you at least have watched over our things? Goodbye, little brother. You take it. - Your watch. - Thanks.
