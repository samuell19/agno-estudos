Louisa! The bell rang! There's no-one there. What do you mean? When a bell rings someone's rung it! Can't even drink in peace! What is it? Is Mr Faulque there? Mr Charles Faulque? He's not here. I know your voice. I've seen you on TV. What do you want? I'm your cancer. Really? Yes. I thought we should meet. But I'm having a drink! We can drink together. Come back another day! Honestly! I must insist, I'm in the area. Or I could see you in Paris... I never go now. I'm disturbing you... you're writing... I stopped when my wife left... It won't take long. Three months max. Is sir talking to himself? Yes, sir is. He's not serious, is he? Sorry, I didn't warn you. But I don't really like letting people know. I like to just turn up. I'm inconsiderate. I'm over-familiar. Yet no-one ever throws me out. Must be something nice about me. You seem nice too... Charles Faulque. Your hand is limp. Limp and sweaty. It feels like an old washcloth. A cold cloth on the forehead can calm a fever. Never forget that. Your maid looks worried. Maid? What maid? This woman in black. She is your maid? Yes! Louisa! She's my maid! She looks worried. Why? Her eyes, for God's sake! Look at them! - What about them? Full of worry! Charles Faulque. Nobody can see cancer. It's invisible. The only ones who see it, except the patient are those who genuinely love you. Don't bother me when I drink! Wine is all I've got! I get cancer and my wife leaves me? A guy like me! No-one would buy it! A story has to be credible! Some problems, OK, but not that many! The bastard! He must be dead! If not I'll just use my feet. I love it when a guy puts up a fight! Ends up on a machine! - What machine? - A ventilator! - Is it the lung? - The lung looks bad... I've got the best doctors! I'm famous! A shit bag like you won't get me! Be polite or I'll do your pancreas! The pancreas is quick! Your wine isn't bad... I drink it all day long. Really? No kidding. I can't believe that... I take my ice bucket everywhere. If I go for a pee, the bucket comes. I am attended by the constant clink of ice. Her body's perfect. Well done! Evguenia, isn't it? How did you know her name? Isn't that her name? That's a bad joke. All jokes are bad. I don't remember ever laughing at a joke. Not once. I don't want your cancer. - Don't you want to die? - No. Why not? Your life's shit... You really think so? Your wife's left you! You won a Pulitzer. You won't win another. You drink too much. It's not so great... Yes, it's true. It's not so great... I like your laugh... Very pleasant... Yours isn't. It stinks. To be expected... it smells rotten. One more for dinner? What was that? Is he staying for dinner? Who? The man with you. You can see him? Women can see things... Louisa. Yes. I'm staying for dinner? - I want to go... - Where? To that woman! What for? To embrace her! You're too drunk! So I'm not moving! OK, I'm too drunk. Be careful. You're very unstable. I always have been. So I became a writer. And an alcoholic. I forget which order... I say! Not bad! This is Louisa. She's the housekeeper. Since forever. Hello, Louisa. Hello, Louisa. How long have you been here? I've always worked here. My mother did before me. In the vineyards. Until Mr Ferdinand died. And the vines were sold. I knew the Parisians, who renovated it. Then the next lot who did more work. That's a lot of workmen. Will you stay on with us? You're buying it? What about you? What will you do? Will you stay on? If you do, we'll buy the house. This house doesn't suit people from the big city. What do you mean? Nothing. She means nothing. Louisa loves life. Shall we start the visit? Give me time to love her. Before I die, I want her. I need a hand on my brow. Let it be hers. And Evguenia? What will you do with her? She could be my daughter! - Hasn't stopped you! - She's Russian! You know what they're like! - You old lecher! Shit, you're right. I'll write her a cheque and call a taxi. That's a little premature... What is? Calling a taxi. Is it? What a bastard. You know how it is... Girls like a cuddle. Or you like a cuddle? With a kid? I knew a guy who just wanted to cuddle... - All the time? - No. Just on his deathbed... And? What happened? What do you mean? The guy who wants a cuddle! Cuddle who? I want to know! He was stubborn. He didn't want to go, hanging on annoying everyone, he was done for, the bell was tolling... but he hung on. About your age, not so easygoing... Anyway, he wants his daughter. She was five. "But she's asleep!" Mum didn't want to wake her. It was late, but he insisted! No, this will just depress you. No, not at all! If I get upset, I'll just drink. They sent a taxi to fetch the little girl. Her nanny carried her in, still asleep, in her pink nightgown. They laid her down, next to her daddy. He cuddled up to her, and he died. Like a child, very gently. He needed soft curls... the smell of a sleeping child's neck. Any more stories like that? Lots! Lots! You're dribbling. Really? Yes, you're dribbling. You ought to stop drinking and go to bed. Will you come with me? Don't worry, I'll be right behind you. Careful. Can you make it? You fucker! That's right... Good skin! Really good. Considering... But I'm not dying. Really? Great! I can go then? Yes, you can go. Yes but I like it here! I'd love to see this place in the spring. Oh, sorry, I shouldn't say spring, silly me. Spring, what a stupid word. New beginning, my arse! Oh, look, a big tear welling up... Shall we wipe it? Yes, I think we better had. - But what with? - With a tissue, old fellow! No dessert? Louisa's made her tart. Her tart? The one you always ask for. You know the one? Just a bit tired. After a lie down it'll pass. Shall I come too? Certainly not! Certainly not! I need rest. Oh no! I disagree! I'm not against affection! You rest, darling. I'll watch a film. She doesn't give a shit. Thanks, I know that. So what are you doing with her? Asshole. "Asshole"? You're calling me an asshole? - Yes, asshole! Such dumb questions! Stick to my death, not my life! Don't you feel like a nice glass of wine? It's been a while since you had any. You piece of shit! Evguenia! My love! I'm cured! I'll marry you! Evguenia! My love! I'm cured! I'll marry you! A cancerous cell is immortal. Cancerous cells multiply while the healthy cells decline. Always. The healthy cell is condemned to die. - The triumph of evil! - Exactly! Evil always comes back. Who are you phoning? Answer me, you bitch! Answer him. It's not a difficult question! It's simple! - I called the doctor! The doctor? Which doctor? A doctor for whom? Mr Faulque! But Mr Faulque is fine! Look at him! I called the doctor anyway! Where did you find this doctor? His family doctor! Since when? Ever since he moved here. Not up to much then. You're looking well. Blood pressure, reflexes, heart, all fine, I can get the ECG from my car, if you like. But there are all those steps... He's crap. You need to get a new doctor. I like him! He's reassuring. Too late for that! It's time to be worried! The only thing that still worries me is your drinking. Do you still drink as much? - I keep up a good pace. - Meaning? When I wake up... I have a bottle of white. At about 10 am, just to mark the occasion, to show solidarity, to all those workers about to take a break, I drink a second one. Another white before lunch. For lunch I might go over to red instead. Or both. Then it's naptime. That's four bottles. Which is why a nap is useful. A couple of hours. When I wake up my mouth always feels dry, so I start off on the white again. Then swimming, winter and summer, to clear the head, wake myself up. Then it's... that fateful time, the pre-dinner drinks. Do we wait for the official time or not? I hate to waste time so I get stuck in! And I get hammered! And when do you write? Never! How could I write? You need a clear head for that! For at least five minutes! I don't have that. I'm always drunk. Sometimes I feel down. I might just as well die. Don't look like that. Of course I'll die. That's all he wants. He's drooling! I'm not drooling. I'm doing my job. Wiping the streets. There aren't any! It's the country! I'm sorry, it was just an image. So I look like dog shit? - What? - You mentioned streets! Where you get dog shit, not daffodils! You can't stop me. I'm immortal. I'll get you. In my own time. I'll prescribe you some Kardegic 75, it's for the heart, it can't hurt... So you're Louisa? Who is this Louisa? Everyone talks about you. Why are they so interested? What's so great about you? Nothing. That's not true. I'm interested, very interested, especially in your breasts. May I examine them? - What? - Your breasts. They're not big but I'd like to examine them a bit. If you want... Excuse me, I'm worried. The doctor's upstairs. You have lovely breasts. Any children? I have no children. However, you've got a nice little lump... Can you feel the lump? I don't bother with it. You should, because the lump will bother you. Excuse me, you're so pretty, I can't help looking. All men look at me. You should be happy. You don't look it... It's hard being young and pretty, attracting all men. What am I doing with my life? You will pack up and leave. Is that wiser? Absolutely. What about Charles? He has other things to do. He's sick. And you're healthy. Enjoy being a young girl. You know how they live? No. They dance and laugh. They charm everyone. None of that here. No laughter, not even the sound of a motorbike. What has he got? Who? Charles? I'm not sure. But I have a bad feeling. I can feel something prowling. I'm only a country doctor, but I can feel these things. If a wolf is prowling you lock up the sheep. I can't leave like that! Like what? Without a word! Go and say goodbye. I love these moments, when the poor devil thinks he's invincible, and imagines the world revolves around his dick! Shut your mouth! Let the kid climax in peace! Some cancers are for bosses. Others for employees. I'm for employees. I know you'll take care of Charles. I say: you take care. Don't squander yourself. What does squander mean? Don't sell your beauty. Give presents, don't receive them. Apart from a child. That's the best present. But God gives that. It was practically the same scene a few years earlier, When Carole left, in the night. The same steps, the same path to the gate, but there was a child. An 8 year-old boy, Stanislas, my love. I was up there, on my balcony, hugging my ice bucket, watching my life leaving, I found it normal, because I was drunk. But you were sobbing. You weren't there! This is a flashback! Maybe I was there! Let me go, it's for the best! You're a monster. I'm broken. You can see your son when you want. You've met someone? I met misery and disappointment! You were drunk when I gave birth! A birth should be celebrated, good God! My son was born! I never had luck with women. They like me, I seduce them, at first it's great, then very soon they realise they're bored. With me, I mean. I bore them. Do you know why? Why what? Why they get bored? Who? Women! With you! I'm a pain, I'm a jerk, I'm selfish, thoughtless, badly finished. For example I drink. I don't believe you. I do sometimes. But not every day! Women don't like men who drink, unless he's a genius, which I'm not. Even if I were, they'd still leave me. Women prefer average men, even stupid ones, if they behave. Guess what I did when Carole left. Am I supposed to know? You're supposed to shut up! I'm not terminal yet! Just the terminal phase of bullshit! What was I saying? I don't know. Pay attention, don't nod off! But I'm bored of your talking! I'm not your mate! Carole has just left! What do I do? Christ, I don't know! I rush into the kitchen. I go to the fridge. And what do I do? Open the door. I open the fridge door! Correct, for once! I open it. I keep it open. - Then? - I put my head in it! - Inside! Was it a big fridge? - Very! I drank everything! Vodka, wine, champagne! Louisa put me to bed! I don't know how she got me to my bedroom which is upstairs. A good woman, that Louisa. Devoted, loyal. A good woman. I washed him. I put him to bed. I watched him sleep. He looked like a corpse. He was cold. I felt burning hot. I covered him with a sheet, I wanted to get under it, press myself against him, feel my skin against his skin. I got undressed. then I got into bed. He was completely out of it. I could do anything I wanted, touch him, caress him, put my hand where I wanted. He never stirred. Don't fall asleep, I told myself. Be careful, don't fall asleep. When I woke, in a sudden panic, it was light, birds were singing. He wasn't there. Where was he? He was in the kitchen making coffee. What a load of rubbish! A maid's fantasy! Did you put me to bed? Yes. Then I went to bed with you. You were in bad shape, I was feeling sad. Did we have sex? That's my little secret, sir. Feel free to hand me my notice. Pack my suitcase. I'm going to Paris. He came back with the Russian, a delightful child. I loved her immediately. - My arse! I said "immediately"! Her name's Evguenia. One must bow down before beauty. We all have our role. My role is carrying bags. You could help me. Cancer doesn't carry bags! It brings bad luck! That's all! Is that clear? It's very clear! If I'm here, it's bad! Or much worse than usual! No more low necklines! Not too jealous? I am a bit jealous. He'll prefer you. What do you know? You're lovelier. No. I mean your soul. Russians talk souls. Yours is more beautiful. I'm a little whore. You are a true force. Do you want to cry? No. I think you do. Here's my empty pool, my ice bucket, my cancer. What more do I want? Nice atmosphere! Can I ask you something? That depends. You can try. I'd like a little bit of time. - Not much. - What for? To love a man. A man who's leaving? He needs some nice luggage. Please God, give him the guts to join me. Here in my room. To knock at my door. He'll be embarrassed about wanting his maid. Make this day come soon. While we are still alive. How are her lymph nodes? I've only just got here? Me too! And the doctor? Couldn't hurt a fly! So what's the problem? Why are you nervous? I'm fed up with here! The country? I've had enough of this job! It's the same as ever. Something's not right. Scared of the chemo? If I were scared of chemotherapy I would have worked in funerals. No risk there. Why are you so worried? - The maid bothers me. - Louisa? She 's so kind. - She's a whore! And she's in love! - All women are. - But she's besotted! With her boss! It could be tricky. What's this red stuff? Gaspacho. It's Spanish. It's a chilled soup. I don't like cold soup. So don't eat any. Nobody's forcing you. I want to go home. Why? Don't you like us? I'm so fed up with always killing people! What's up, old thing? Down in the dumps? You must buck up. Killing is good. Take me for example. Imagine if I lived! What would I become? An old fart! An asshole! Fit for a museum! - What's the pink stuff? - Cold salmon. Cold salmon! I want a hot meal! Steak! Meat is bad for Mr Faulque's diet. No more diets! Or cholesterol problems! Now it's a brain tumour! A tumour! Very nice! Ol?! But a brain tumour is incurable! That's right. Incurable. You're luckier than him. You'll lose a breast but might not die. I said "might not". I need a favour. It depends what it is. I need to be alone. Favour refused. Why "refused"? Just for five minutes! You don't trust me? - I want to watch. - Watch what? - You with Louisa! - What? You'll ring for her? Maybe! I don't know! Ring her! There's the bell! Sit down, Louisa. I've got cancer. Yes, sir. I can see it. A brain tumour. Yes, sir. I know. I'll get migraines, abnormal migraines. The doctor will come. He'll give drugs, useless drugs. Then hospital, a brain scan, the surgeons will say: "It's hopeless." There. That's my future. I'll be there till the end. I'll hold your hand. I'll help you fight. Fight against what? One can always fight! I don't want to. I've had enough of life. I'm alone with no aims. Excuse me, sir. I'll try to say it... It's difficult to say what I want. I'll try. You're tiring him. Go back to your kitchen and your pans! If Mr Faulque says! If he says so, I'll go. I don't want that. I want you to stay. Sit down, Louisa. I like you here. You were right. The woman's spinning her web. I love you. Pardon? What was that? I love you. What? Have I offended you? No. Not at all. I love you. Quite simply. With all the love I have. I've never given it away. A little modesty! This is getting ridiculous! Shut your mouth! If we need you we'll call! Here comes the first migraine! I could tell he wasn't feeling well! And I was right! Lucky you, your first morphine injection. The soothing effect of the drug... Can I drink? Drink what? My wine. Finish my bottle. - It's empty. - I've got more. - That makes six today. - Louisa, I beg you. I'm thirsty. Thirsty. Operating would be butchery. Let the poor guy die in peace. There's a thing in my head! Get it out! Murgezik every two hours. 30 mg. I asked them to call your son. You must see him. Not like this! We're going home. Dad? Won't you come in? I can get a room ready. Mr Faulque would like to see you. Who's that woman? She comes to help me in the kitchen. I'm busy now with Mr Faulque. I'll be back on Sunday. I have friends in N?mes. Are we staying or leaving? Can't you leave me alone? I'm a broken woman. I tried to start over, but look at me! Come in. Who's that sitting on your knee? A friend. A friend from where? We just met. We stick together. I don't like him. He looks daunting but he's not so bad. Dad. Yes. Don't die. You keep on living. Lighting up the world. A world without you? Get lost for a while! I don't take orders! My son's come from Paris to see me. - I'm asking for 15 minutes. - 15 minutes! Dad. Yes. I just wanted to say "Dad". The best word ever. You're tiring your father! His migraine is back! Off you go to bed now! Come in. You look strange. What's wrong? Why is he here? Shut up! Kill me but don't talk. Sit down, son. What's the matter? Something terrible. What? I slept with Louisa. And? Was it good? The best day of my life. Apart from when I was born, which I don't recall. I don't like this conversation. You were told to shut up! Do you know who I am? Shall I take care of your white blood cells? Hands off him! I'll touch who I like! I've killed many! Just like that! Men are as weak as a house of cards! Finished? Absolutely! I'm tired now. Asshole! I'll have the last laugh. No-one wants to laugh. No-one's laughing here. Maybe in other families but not here. Stanislas! What is it, my boy? Did something scare you? Is life any good? What? Is it worth it? Sometimes it's wonderful, sometimes it's shit. But right now, here, just the two of us, as I see you spread your wings, it is so worth it. In Louisa's room I saw something horrible. What did you see? We're in her room now. When it was over, I turned over to rest, I saw something awful. What did you see? There, sitting on the chair. The chair's empty! But look at that repulsive old bitch! "Who are you?" I said. I'm here for your girlfriend's tumour. "What girlfriend?" That's what you call someone you just fucked. That's how they talk nowadays. Your girlfriend's going to die of breast cancer. What's this about? Not only great writers get cancer. Anyone can get it! Maids! Asbestos victims! Not Louisa! Not only is she a maid, she's also a whore! That's pedophilia! In my world! - Which is? The empire of evil, which always wins! We'll be here till the end! Can't you get off my back? No, cancer sticks to your arse! Like shit! I may not see my son again! Don't trust him! He's up to no good! Are you plotting something? No, I'm pissed and I want to phone my mother, but she's dead! - Who? - My mum! She died! - What of? - Grief! - Why? - None of your business! At all! I was a child too! I was beaten, I had to sleep with the pigs! That's why I became bad. Thank you. For sharing that moment. We must meet again. We will. I'm sure we could almost be friends. Yes. Of course. A nice idea. Something French. Like Ravel. Is the Pulitzer a lottery or is it serious? It's a lottery. Go on! See your kid off! Hope he's smarter than you. You've ten minutes! How are you? Will you be OK? I'll be OK. Go and hide, you're too beautiful. I'll say bye to my son. He has your eyes. Go on, my boy. Be brave. Think of nice things. They do exist. Dad, I'm afraid. I feel the world is going bad, men have gone mad. They've always been mad. Me most of all. I don't regret it. But you're dying. The game isn't over. I have an idea. An idea for what? For screwing the enemy. No! Please! No photos! I'm not drunk! Honest! It's just my back! Help me, or my cancer will be mad at me! Cancer? That's not what I meant! Don't repeat that! In fact I think I'm drunk. Look at the fools! They're in love! Of course they are. Let's double it. - Double what? - The toxicity! Send in the metastases! - What? - No idea! You're deaf! See a doctor! - Probably words of love. - Love! - I can't work with this! - So spare them. I'd rather die! How? Prick yourself on your dick? The decor is a bit dodgy in places, it needs cleaning. Did it belong to that writer? Writer! Everyone's a writer now! What's this? It's not over? It's nearly over. You'd better hurry up, my clients are interested. Where do you think you're going? I'm going for a mammogram. It's too late! Your cancer has spread! I'm in the lung now! Book your place at the cemetery! Have you seen? It's good work. What's this? A Rodin. Not bad. It's worth a mint. I imagine so. I imagine so. - Holding it steady? - Yes. - Where are the pliers? - Here they are! - What? - Someone's in the house! What do you mean? Be careful. They may as well kill me! Watch out! We've come for the Rodin! You won't get it! No! What the hell is this? No need for metastases now, buddy. What now? Do what you like, I'm off. Don't leave me, I can't stand blood! All that crap makes me thirsty. Subtitles: Caroline Maraval Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
