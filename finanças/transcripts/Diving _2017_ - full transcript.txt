Why are you following me? What? I'm not. Yes, you are. I saw you last week in Paris in my exhibition. Uh... Yes, it's true. I was there. So, what are you doing here? I'm a journalist and I have to interview, um, a musical band tonight. That's why. Oh. Which one? Which one? Uh, The Flying Burritos. - Flying Burritos? - Yes. They're really good. - You don't know them? - No. So, it's uh, Burning Topaz. Burning Topaz is even better. How did you find me? Luck. Can I drop you somewhere? Yes. I am César, by the way. I'm Paz. I know. You know what is, uh... What do you call it? Souffletas... souffletos? What? Souffletos? Open your mouth. Well, you're a beginner. That's so... - At least... - You say that because you're not agreeing with me and you know I'm right. - What? - You know I'm right. - No, you're not. - It's not... But that is... I'm happy you feel something here. What? I don't understand. She keeps yelling! I am 40 years old, you know! She keeps yelling at me. I just wanna buy her fruit. Do you know that we are not allowed to touch the water? Why not? It's... It's, um, sagrado. Sacred. Sacred. I know that it's something that any human hand has touched. Tell me... Why do they call you Dolores? Dolores, um... is the name I was given at birth. Paz is the name I gave myself. Between sorrow and... peace, I made my choice. And you? Let-Let me guess. Mmm. You were born... Do you want kids? - What? - Do you want some children? No. I want some wine. Wine! You're so beautiful. What? You're so beautiful! Beautiful. I'm beautiful. I love this song! It's wine, it's-it's cheese... You're handsome when you wake up. It's Brittany. - You know Brittany? - No. Now you know. Brittany. Do you think that music can change the world? Yes. You think a painter can change the world? - Yes. - You can change the world... - Yes. - ...with your photo? With your image? And you can change the world with your writing... Sing, little girl... Imagine a world where money is limitless and scoffs at legislation. A world soon to be dominated by continental states... Paz! What are you doing? Did I wake you? Well, yeah. There's coffee. What time is it? It's 8 a.m. on Sunday. - Already? - Yeah. I found it, César. I found it. After weeks of searching, now I've got it! I finally know what I want. I've been always taking pictures of shores because they're places of transit, collision and, so... I just had it to keep going. That's what haunts me and nothing else. So, why would I stop? Why should it change? So I decided to keep going and I changed my point of view and the place, and I found where to go. Wonderful. Where? Aden. - In Yemen? - Yes. No. It's the logical progression of my work in Gibraltar. The Gulf of Aden separates Africa and Asia. Aden's got nothing to do with Gibraltar. If you want sand, go to Corsica. Don't bullshit me! You know what I want is not in Corsica. And it's not here. I have to go to Aden. Some years ago, the Gulf of Aden was a path for many migrants to Yemen and now is the other way around. There's a reason for that. Paz! My love... Leave your camera there! César, I know exactly what it means to you but I'm used to traveling, so... I won't take any risk. César, I haven't been able to work for months. I need to go. No. You don't know Yemen, you don't speak Arabic! It's a shitstorm. Travel's banned! Read the papers! You have no press pass. If anything happens, you're screwed! Understand? Then come with me. If I can't go alone, come with me. I won't go there. Neither will you. That's that. Why don't you write a book about your abduction? Write a book about your abduction! Don't you miss real journalism? No, it's been a long time. I've moved on. Stop it! What? Is he mocking you? He's a pain in the ass! He just makes me laugh, I can't help it. That's how I seduced you. So you make her laugh? - All the time? - Specially while we make love. It's true. You OK, my love? Yeah. Need anything? No, I'm OK. - Something didn't agree with you. - The whole evening. Can I borrow your leather bag? I'm going to Saint-Nazaire. That's not too far? Not too dangerous? I thought that was next week. No, tomorrow. I'll be back on Monday. I don't know why I'm going. Because you're in Gustave's book and you've got no choice. Don't you wanna come? You don't need me. Go alone. With the handsome Gustave! You're dumb! Feeling better, love? You OK? What's the matter? What's going on? Tell me. What's wrong? I'm pregnant. Why do you say it like that? You're pregnant? You're pregnant, my love? I'm so happy! You're pregnant? Really? Yeah. I'm gonna be a daddy? How do you feel? I don't know. Like I wanna throw up. I wanna cry every two seconds. But I don't even know why. I'm suffocating. I feel weird. - I'm all... - All pregnant. Miss, please, no photos. Why not? You can buy the book, if you like, or you'll have to leave. Fuck you. That wasn't necessary. This is perfect timing, Gustave. I knew her previous work. On space and beaches... Thank you! Hello. A coffee, please. What's your name? Damla. Paz. Why were you taking pictures of that book? Well, why not? Thanks. What do you do for living? Stuff. Stuff? Stuff. Do you like Gustave's photos? They're OK. You can give me your address I can ask him to send you a copy if you want. I'm fine. I'm not begging. What do you want from me? You wanna be a do-gooder? Well, excuse me for not having 50 bucks to blow on a book, much less, two grand for a photo. Fifteen thousand. You wanna come with me? I'll show you what I do if you're interested. Sure. Listen the sounds, they're real. There's almost no silence at all underwater any more because of the oil tankers and trollers. We install this very powerful sound sensors in different spots all around the world. You can hears the sounds of what's going on under water. That's what we hear. The troller you hear is going over at that very moment. A whale, a tortoise, or shark... we don't know. I wanted to suddenly feel like them. As disturbed as they are in response to that fucking human sound. It has to be realistic, fascinating but scary. How did you end up here? How many of you are there? We are not a lot. We are a collective. We move around a lot. We meet people wherever we go willing to our projects. We're not supposed to be here. Where are we supposed to be? I don't know. And you? And me? You work with them? I've never seen you here. No, not at all. But you're a photographer? And what do you do? I play music. Guitar. But I'm not an artist. Not like them. I live here. I hang out here. That's how we met. So they asked me to do some sound work. They just bum around. I feel old. Om? You can be young and feel old. When you stop making decisions. When you become immobile. An immobile. Then move. Move! Dark eye of the hunter! I said... the dark eye of the hunter. Pain. You're a shark. Me? Yeah. - What are you eating? - A bun. Oh, honey! You shouldn't eat that stuff. Sure, I should, Mom. Try to eat some vegetables. A more balanced diet. My diet's fine. Don't worry. Are you smoking? I'm trying to quit. Don't smoke! - Well... - What? Once in a while. Why? Stop, once and for all. Why? You have to quit! - Mom... - What? Please! Paz, I need the bathroom. I have a meeting. I'm late! Two seconds! Two seconds! It's nuts! I can't even use the bathroom? This is bullshit! - Were you in here all night? - Yeah. I guess that's normal, too. I'll wash up in the kitchen. Good night, good morning... wherever you are in your day. See you later, angel. Kisses! Kisses, my love. Hi. Hello. Your shark is in the Indian Ocean. Arabian sea, 16 degrees 03 minutes 46 seconds North, 60 degrees 25 minutes 39 seconds East. Push to follow. Hmm. This one's great. I really like six of these photos. So we're fine. I don't know. No, it's not fine. Trust me. If I say it's good, it's good. You shoot faces like you shoot landscapes. It's consistent. Consistent? It's aimless. Thoughtless. I'm not saying these faces aren't beautiful or interesting. I'm saying they reek of fear and doubt. My fear, my doubt. There's no eye. The eye's missing. You're wrong. You're interrogating them the way you interrogate yourself. This one's a little underexposed. But that's in. No, it's extinguished. I'm extinguished. You can be exhausting! I don't give a damn what's in. Stop fucking around, Paz. You're just starting to get some attention. Drag your feet, and they'll forget you. What? Is that what you want? You're a pain! What's going on? I'm lost. He said he was having a show. How are you, my love? I'm almost done. So the guy says, "You have to come..." What are you doing? No! Either I'm an idiot or it's defective! See that? It's supposed to go in here, but no! I'm going nuts! What's that? One kick, one photo. But we can't see the kick in the photo. That's what you like! I see! That's a lovely idea. Weird, but a lovely idea. Weird and lovely. Like you, my love. So... That's it? What? Weird and lovely. That's all? No, that's not all. What then? A pain, too! I'm trying to do this! I'm serious. What else am I? I don't know! Beautiful, intense, passionate... Angry! Unhappy, at the moment, but... inspired! Not anymore. What's the matter? You see I'm unhappy and don't mention it? I just did. Does being pregnant and uninspired make you unhappy? Don't I have the right? Of course, you do. I didn't say that! I'm pregnant. What should I be? Over the moon? With another view of life? Yes, no. I don't know. I don't do anything anymore. I'm out of ideas. I should be... I should be full and I'm empty. But I felt empty even before I was pregnant. What do you want? I don't fucking know. Don't you want something else? What do you wanna do? I don't know. Paz, angel, I don't understand. I'm sorry, but I don't. Like this fucking crib! I don't get that either! And there's not enough room in here. The studio? What studio? Do I have to give up my studio? I didn't say that! - But that's what you think. - No, I don't! What's with you today? And what's that constant fucking beeping? Well, ask me! If it bugs you, say something. What's that beeping? I adopted a shark. Now what bullshit is this? I'm a shark's Godmother, if you prefer. I'd prefer you explain. Those scheduled beeps are it's beacon. I'm following it with a GPS. I lost him yesterday and now there he is. It happens. You adopted a shark? Why? When? How? Why didn't you tell me? You never asked. What kind of moronic answer is that? Why? Does it reassure you? What? Tracking a shark day and night. Does that reassure you? Does it feed you? Paz? Don't you wanna choose a name for our baby? Shop for a stroller? Fight for a spot in day care? I'm getting sick of all your stuff. Then Why'd you knock me up? What? You shouldn't have gotten me pregnant. - I didn't mean... - Fine! You always want more! More thrills, passion, everything! You don't understand. We don't understand each other. No, not anymore. At least we agree on that. I can't live with someone who doesn't know who I am. Stop! What do I do with the...? Make tea. OK, tea. What did you say? What did you say again? - Make tea. - Right! How much longer? Is this the beginning or the end? Touching words by Mercedes Sosa... "I admire this extraordinary Chilean woman, and what she wrote." On roads of seaweed and choral. And phosphorescent seahorses Will do. A round by your side. And the people from the water will play. Soon by your side. Put the lamp down a little more. Let me sleep... ...don't tell him I am here. Tell him that Alfonsina won't come back. And if he calls, Don't ever tell him that I'm here. Tell him I have gone... What's up? You peed your little pants! Didn't you? It's all shit! You OK? And my precious baby? Sweetheart! Daddy's home. The Velasquez show was great. That's good. Want me to take over? Yeah. Daddy's home! Yes, sweetheart. I can't take it! He's really hungry. Yes, my love. I can't take it anymore! Go for a walk! What can I say? - Is there milk in the fridge? - Yeah. DREAM Where were you? I left you 10 messages. I didn't take my phone. It's fucking 10 o'clock. You said to go for a walk. A walk, not a world tour! Is he asleep? Obviously! With me, he sleeps. We sleep. Sure, he does. He has no choice. I realized something. You don't leave room for anyone else. Your head's overflowing. We don't exist. There's just you. You, you, you. Your ideas, problems, anxieties. Your inspiration, lack of inspiration. But us... You're never really here. You're always in your head. Always. Then why do you stay? Why do I stay? How fucking stupid can you be? Now what do you need? Words? You need words? Little reassuring phrases? Can't you fucking see? Don't you know why I stay? I stay because I love you. I love you. I prove it every day. But even that you don't see! You only think of yourself. I'm all alone here. Now, I beg you, stop with the words. We need actions! For you, for me, for us! Actions! But move your ass, angel. I can't take it anymore. I'm tired, understand? I'm tired, too. I'd like to sleep, too. What do you think? But how can I? How can I? If you wanna sleep, give Hector your studio. Wouldn't that help? People ask me what an artist is. I think an artist brings others pain. Some singers bring others pain, and some singers don't. Some people have talent, and some don't have talent. Talent's a desire to do something. But it's not just that. Then you have a lifetime to burn, trying to do that something. Every singer corresponds to something. Every film corresponds to something. Every flower corresponds to something. Every climate corresponds to something. I think... Jacques Brel, are you ever afraid of not being honest with yourself? That would really upset me. How do you avoid cowardice? You have to move. To go out and see things. You have to make discoveries, be curious. Be humble and say, "I don't know." There are two reactions to the unknown. You can say it's dumb or look into it. I prefer the latter. That always prompts you to reinvent the world of childhood. I don't think we ever stop being children. I don't think adulthood exists. It's just an attitude. We never stop chasing our childhood dreams. A man who doesn't tremble before a woman... Don't try to tell me that's virility. It's foolishness! You must tremble till your dying day. The guilt's gonna... gonna kill me. No, it won't! What can I do? - Can't I give you... - Nothing. I'm with you, you know. I'm with you, and I understand you. I didn't think it would be so hard. It's true, it is hard, honey. It's not exactly you. It's not totally you. It's something else. Usually, your frames are huge with thousands of details. This is very concrete. It's... reduced to the scale of a face. We're in that gaze. I don't know how to... And before, there was color. Now... It's black and white. Yeah. No, but... Yeah. It's different... But it's strong. Very strong. And their gazes have... an emotion, a tension that's... that you... I don't know. Before it... It was better? No, it's not... It's not a question of better. It just... It was more expansive. More open. It was... Freer. So... - It's gonna be great, huh? - Yes! She was ready. How are you? It looks cool! Hello. Hello, my love. Don't grow too much. I'll be here. You'll feel me... inside of you. I want to see you grow up. But I have to go. Don't grow too much, please. Where are you going? Paz... - What are you doing? - Let me by. I need time. I need to disappear. I'll be back. Don't go. Don't go. What did you give him? Tylenol? That's fine. Is he still crying? If it doesn't go down, call me. Thanks. I'll be home around 10. - You're back? - Yeah, two days ago. - It's hot. - I imagine. You? I'm off to the Bourdelle Museum. Your article's lousy. Rewrite it. - What's with you? - Just rewrite it! Léo! My boy! How are you? You know, I feel like a kid! Look! Magnificent, isn't it? 1893. The year Bourdelle began working for Rodin, as an apprentice. We don't know who the model was. It looks like Medardo Rosso, don't you think? - A little bit, yes. - Don't you think? The style, everything! Was it ever exhibited? Yeah, at the 1893 Salon. It had a second life. A merchant made bronze reproductions. We had the bronzes. But this plaster version... The mold. It's the mold! I've searched for it for years. Come here. Look at this. The balance between the infant's head and the breast. Look at the artist's fingerprints! It's so alive! We're speechless before such beauty and purity. It's so alive. Touch it! Can you feel the workmanship? The fingerprints? There, there, my love. You're feeling better. I spoke to Mommy, you know. She called me. She called to see how you were. I told her we were just fine. That we miss her, of course. But we're savoring our time together. Just you and me! That we're having a ball together. She's working. So, so hard. She said she misses you enormously. And that she thinks about you all day, every day. And she sends you kisses. In this area, the divers know this technique well and use it frequently to sedate the predators. The shark finds itself in a state of trance which leads ultimately to tonic immobility. The diver manages to gently hoist it... How's it going? It's César. What are you up to? Wanna come over for a drink? No problem. You've reached Paz's voice mail. Leave me a message. This is Paz's voice mail. Leave a message. Paz, it's me. I don't know where you are. But I hope you're well. I wanted to say that... I just realized you didn't take your cameras. Sol have no idea what you're doing. I think you're making a fool of me! I apologize. But it's not easy. I can't understand why you... don't even ask about him. Us, who cares? But him... He's fine. He's getting bigger. He's beautiful. He looks more and more like you. I think he misses you. I miss you, too. Hector, Hector, stop. Stop, my love. I can't fucking take it anymore. Fuck! I'll just let you cry. Cry all night. I can't take it any more. What do you want? Don't eat it. Pick it, but don't eat it. And you're eating it! No! I said no! Hello. Yes, speaking. Sorry, I can't hear you very well... I don't know what you're talking about. I... Yes. Yes. Fine. - Purpose of visit? - Visiting. Visiting... Welcome, César. - Salaam-alaikum. - Alaikum-salaam. Abdullah! It's been a while. I changed careers. The purpose of your visit? Vacation. You've reached Paz's voice mail. Leave me a message. This is Paz's voice mail. Leave a message. You've reached Paz's voice mail. Is that her? I'm sorry, I need you to answer aloud. Procedures... Yes. Thank you. Mom? Mom, it's me. It's her. They found her drowned. They found her nude body on a beach. That's all I know, for the moment. I'm OK. It's her, Mom. Don't tell him. No, no, but... Don't tell him! Hello. Many tourists around here? The sea's not too dangerous? Are there currents? I heard... they found someone on the beach. Thank you, sir. Have a nice day. Thank you. Good evening. Everything OK? Just fine, thanks. Today's dive? Was it great? See you later. Hello, I'm Liza, the hotel manager. Are you all settled in? Just fine, thank you. May I offer you a drink? Gladly. Bring us two drinks, please. Please, have a seat. Are you here to go diving? Yes. You'll see, it's beautiful. Thank you. You speak Arabic? A little. That's rare. Do they all come here to go diving? Most of them. I hear they found a woman's body on the beach. A foreigner. They told you that already? No, I overheard the villagers. They didn't know I understood. - That's terrible. - Yes, it is. Maybe you knew her. She was a friend. Excuse me. Looking for something? No, thank you. Don't ask so many questions about the body they found at the beach. Here to dive? Yeah. Shark. Lot of shark here, in this sea. And in the dive center they say there is a majnun. - Majnun? - Yeah. Possessed, he talk to the fish. What's his name? Marin. Marin. Thank you. So, you want to buy something? So, César, are you OK? Yeah. I will be right beside you, I'll signal you so you recognize where to see under water. - Visibility is at 10 yard today. - OK. This means rays. This means sharks. - Sharks? - Yes. - We can see them? - Don't worry. Reef sharks, black tips, or ray sharks, and if you're lucky, some pelagic hammerhead sharks in particular. Don't worry, they are absolutely harmless. - There has never been an accident? - Never. - Never? - Never. It's a friend of mine who told me about your dive center. - Really? - Yeah. She used to come a lot of times. She told me it was very very good. OK. Perhaps you know her. Maybe, tell me more. Uh, brunette... really, really, really beautiful, Spanish. No, I'm sorry. Sorry. Hope we got better visibility today. I hope so. Did you like it? - Very much. - Gonna go back? I don't think so. There's a big storm predicted tonight. We may even close the bar. You have a phone call. Thank you. Please, put him on. Hello, my love! It's Daddy. How are you, angel? Yes! I miss you, son. I'm far away, by the ocean. It's very beautiful here. One day, I'll take you to the sea. César... I'm here. Can you feel me? Hello. Hello. Been coaching them long? Five years maybe. Go on, girls! Did you go diving today? Yeah, I just got back. Help yourself. It's really hot already. It's true, "Paz" suited her. Better anyway. Internet. It took me five minutes flat. Your name, war reports, kidnapping in Iraq. Then your culture pieces, your reviews. A certain artist, photos... In Venice together, I think. I recognized the body. You knew that, didn't you? To me, she was "Dolores." She was so morose when she got here. Very discreet, very distant. As if something had beaten her down. Hector too close, Hector too far... - Hector. - Hector? Her son, our child. She didn't mention him? No. She never mentioned her son? Fuck! I don't get it. I don't get it. I thought we were close. After all we shared, she kept that from me? Are you talking about you now? About you? It's insane! You're talking about you? Little you? My child just lost his mother. I lost my wife. And you're talking about you? Who gives a fuck about your pain? You think having a few drinks makes you best friends? - I'm sorry. - Who gives a shit? I'm sorry. Girls! Stop! Stop. Now move onto your second exercise. Pair up and stretch it out! I'm sorry. No, I'm the one who's sorry. That was tactless. She got here and started diving right away. Did her first dive with Marin. Then completed the first level. We got to be very close friends. I saw how happy diving made her. Physically, even. She seemed at peace. She smiled. She still kept to herself, but was less antisocial. She started diving every day. Several times a day. You know, you get hooked fast. It's like a drug. That longing for calm, in the depths. Confronting your fears. Dominating them maybe. After a month, she left the hotel. She needed a place to work. Marin found her a cabin near his place. He told the police they hadn't gone diving for days before she was found. That's not true. What did you tell the police? They didn't interrogate me. A woman here has to avoid interacting with the authorities. And Marin's my friend, too. Right... That's all for today! Good work, girls! Bye! - Where does he live? - A few kilometers south. On the coast. Thank you. Marin. Marin. You're gonna tell me now what happened. Calm down. What happened to her? Huh? Who do you think you are? What have you done? - Marin! Marin! - Tell me! Tell me! What happened? Marin, tell him what happened! Tell me! We didn't do anything! Tell him that! That's enough! Stop! An accident. It was an accident. I didn't say anything. They would shut down the dive club, and that's my whole life. Were you with her? Yes. So tell me. She came to see her shark. And that night for the first time he was right nearby. She's the one who insisted on diving. One last dive one last time before she left, she wanted-she wanted me to show her. To show what? What I used to do with sharks. She was so insistent! That's what she came for. Dolores was our friend. What did she say? What? What-what she said? Tell me! I saw a light falling down on the bottom of the sea. She dropped her flashlight... I don't know what happened. Maybe there was a problem with her gas mix or an air bubble. And maybe she passed out. I don't know. I don't know... I don't know. Then? After that? I shouldn't have listened. When we found her she was already dead. So, we took her on the boat. Took off her diving gear, went to another spot and left her there. That's it. What? I'm sorry. That's it? That's it. You told me she was your friend. You told me that... You know what a friend is? She was my wife. She was my wife! I'm sorry. You drowned her! She was alone. You motherfucker! I'm sorry. She was so insistent. That's what she came for. The shark... It is, uh, still here? I want to go there. I want you to show me the last thing she saw. I think I'll always be afraid that you'll disappear, run away and never come back. That paralyzes me. Nonsense! "Run away," you say? Why "run away"? It's funny. When people move, the ones who stay put say they've run away.
