If I live to be a hundred, I'll never be able to forget that big snowstorm... a couple of years ago. The weather closed in, and, well, you might not believe it, but the world almost missed Christmas. Oh, excuse me. Call me Sam. What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a talking snowman before? Nice around here, isn't it? I call it Christmas Town, better known as the North Pole. The Christmas Tree Forest. Yep, here's where we grow them. Nice place to live, you know. Christmas seals. The number-one citizens up here... are the Clauses: Santa and the missis. They live right over there, first castle on the left. Matter of fact, the only castle on the left. Papa, you haven't touched a morsel! I'll have to take this suit in! Eat! I'm busy, Mama! It's almost Christmas! Whoever heard of a skinny Santa? Eat! Eat! Don't any of you worry your heads about Santa. Mrs. Claus will have him plenty fattened up by Christmas Eve. It's always the same story. Ahh! I love this Christmasy time of year, especially when everything is running happy and smooth... like it is this season. Nothing like that year of the big snowstorms. I don't know what we would have done... without Rudolph to pull us through. Anyway... hmm, Rudolph? Could it be some of you are not acquainted... with the story of Rudolph? Well, pull up an ice block and lend an ear. Now, you know how Santa uses these flying reindeer... to pull his sleigh. You know Dasher and Dancer... and Prancer and Vixen... Comet and Cupid... and Donner and Blitzen... ♪ But do you recall ♪ ♪ The most famous reindeer of all? ♪ Well, now, let me tell you about Rudolph. It all started a couple of years before the big snow. It was springtime, and Santa's lead reindeer Donner... had just become a proud papa. Nah, we'll call him Rudolph. Rudolph is a lovely name. Rudolph. Hey, hey! He knows his name already! Papa. Mama. He's got a shiny nose! Shiny? I'd even say it glows! Well, we'll simply have to overlook it. How can you overlook that? His beak blinks like a blinking beacon! Well, Donner, where's the new member of the family? After all, if he's going to be on my team someday, he'd better get to know me. Well, hi there. Aren't you the sturdy little fellow? Santa? And smart, too! Great bouncing iceberg! I'm sure it'll stop when he grows up, Santa. Well, let's hope so if he wants to make the sleigh team someday. You see, little fellow, every year I shine up my jingle bells... for eight lucky reindeer. ♪ Jingle, jingle, jingle ♪ ♪ You will hear ♪ ♪ my sleigh bells ring ♪ ♪ I am old Kris Kringle ♪ ♪ I'm the king of jing-a-ling ♪ ♪ Jingle, jingle, reindeer ♪ ♪ Through the frosty air ♪ ♪ they'll go ♪ ♪ They are not just plain deer ♪ ♪ They're the fastest deer ♪ ♪ I know, ho ho ♪ ♪ You must believe ♪ ♪ that on Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ I won't pass you by ♪ ♪ I'll dash away ♪ ♪ in my magic sleigh ♪ ♪ Flying through the sky ♪ ♪ Jingle, jingle, jingle ♪ ♪ You will hear ♪ ♪ my sleigh bells ring ♪ ♪ I am old Kris Kringle ♪ ♪ I'm the king of jing-a-ling ♪ ♪ I am old Kris Kringle ♪ ♪ I'm the king of jing-a-ling ♪ Ho ho! Bye-bye. Oh, Santa's right. He'll never make the sleigh team. Wait a minute! I've got it! We'll hide Rudolph's nose. - Hide it? - Yeah. Come here, boy. You'll be a normal little buck just like everybody else, right? A chip off the old antlers. Now, now. You'll get used to it. Put it there, son. Aw, gee. For the first year, the Donners did a pretty fair job... of hiding Rudolph's, uh, nonconformity. Donner taught Rudolph all the ins and outs... of being a reindeer: how to get food, how to fight off enemies, things like that. But most important... Most important of all, he taught his son to beware... of the Abominable Snow Monster of the North. He's mean, he's nasty, and he hates everything to do with Christmas. Now, aside from the Abominable, business goes on as usual. And soon it is right before Christmas, and everybody is getting ready for that big, big sleigh ride... on the night of the 24th-- Christmas Eve! See, all the toys Santa brings are made by these elves. Seems elves have that certain knack for toy-making. All except for this one misfit. Hermey! Aren't you finished painting that yet? There's a pileup a mile wide behind you. What's eating you, boy? Not happy in my work, I guess. What?! I just don't like to make toys. Oh, well, if that's all. What?! You don't like to make toys? No. Hermey doesn't like to make toys. Oh, shame on you! Mind telling me what you do want to do? Well, sir, someday I'd like to be a dentist. A dentist?! Well, we need one up here. I've been studying. It's fascinating. You've no idea. Molars and bicuspids and incisors. Now, listen, you. You're an elf, and elves make toys. Now get to work! 10 minutes break! Not for you! Finish the job, or you're fired! ♪ Why am I such a misfit? ♪ ♪ I am not just a nitwit ♪ ♪ You can't fire me ♪ ♪ I quit ♪ ♪ Seems I don't fit in ♪ Ah, well. Such is the life of an elf. Meanwhile, Rudolph is having his growing pains, too. Old Donner is determined to keep Rudolph's nose a secret. All right, son. Try it on. I don't wanna. Daddy, I don't like it. You'll like it and wear it. Oh, but, Daddy! It's not very comfortable! There are more important things than comfort: self-respect. Santa can't object to you now. ♪ Why am I such a misfit? ♪ ♪ I am just not a nitwit ♪ ♪ Just because my nose glows ♪ ♪ Why don't I fit in? ♪ And so time passes. Christmas comes and goes on schedule, and soon it is April, when all the new fawns come out with their folks... to meet the other new fawns and to be inspected by Santa. Now, don't worry about your nose, son. Just get out there and do your stuff. Remember, you're my little buck. Hi. My name's Fireball. What's yours? - Rudolph. - You can be my buddy. - Where are we going? - The reindeer games. Makes antlers grow. Besides, it's a great way to show off in front of the does. Ah, youth. Meanwhile, the elves are bustling with activity. Christmas is over, but they still keep busy with lessons... in elf improvement. All out for elf practice! Let's get this over with. I have to look over the new deer. OK, Santa. Let's try out the new elf song I wrote. And remember, it's for Santa. And a-1 and a-2 and a-3... ♪ Ho ho ho, ho ho ho ♪ ♪ We are Santa's elves ♪ ♪ We are Santa's elves ♪ ♪ Filling Santa's shelves ♪ ♪ With a toy for each girl and boy ♪ ♪ Oh, we are Santa's elves ♪ ♪ We work hard all day ♪ ♪ But our work is play ♪ ♪ Dolls we try out, ♪ ♪ see if they cry out ♪ ♪ We are Santa's elves ♪ ♪ We've a special job each year ♪ ♪ We don't like to brag ♪ ♪ Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ we always fill Santa's bag ♪ ♪ Santa knows who's good ♪ ♪ Do the things you should ♪ ♪ And we bet you ♪ ♪ he won't forget you ♪ ♪ We are Santa's elves ♪ ♪ We've a special job each year ♪ ♪ We don't like to brag ♪ ♪ Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ we always fill Santa's bag ♪ ♪ Santa knows who's good ♪ ♪ Do the things you should ♪ ♪ And we bet you ♪ ♪ he won't forget you ♪ ♪ We are Santa's elves ♪ ♪ Ho ho ho, ho ho ho ♪ ♪ We are Santa's elves, ho ho ♪ Hmm. Well, it needs work. I have to go. What does Papa know? It's beautiful. You keep it just the way it was. Papa? Papa! That sounded terrible! The tenor section was weak. Wasn't our fault, boss. Hermey didn't show up. What? Now, this won't hurt a bit. Why weren't you at elf practice? Just fixing these dolls' teeth. Just fixing-- Now, listen! We have dolls that cry, talk, walk, blink, and run a temperature. We don't need any chewing dolls. I just thought I found a way to fit in. You'll never fit in! You come to practice and learn how to wiggle your ears... and chuckle warmly and go "hee hee" and "ho ho" and important stuff like that. A dentist! Good grief! No. I just can't. It's like he said: I'll never fit in. I guess I'm on my own now. Hey, look! Does! What do you know? One of them likes you. Yeah, Fireball? You really think so? Here comes the coach. All right. All right, yearlings. All right, now! That's better. My name is Comet. Even though I'm your instructor, I want to be your pal. Right? Right. My job is to make bucks out of you. Let's go. Now then, our first game is called Takeoff. We all want to pull Santa's sleigh someday, so we must learn to fly. Now, who's first to try? Me! Me! One at a time! You're Dasher's little boy, aren't you? You go first. The whole trick is getting up enough speed... and jumping into the wind. You got it? Go ahead. Very good... for a first try. Next! He won't get to us for a while. Go get acquainted with that doe. Nice day. Yup. For takeoff practice, I mean. Yup. I bet you'll be the best. Well, I don't know. Something wrong with your nose? I mean, you talk kind of funny. What's so funny about the way I talk? Don't get angry. I don't mind. You don't? My name's Clarice. Hi. My name's Rudolph. Hi. Hi. Hey, Clarice... after practice, would you-- would you-- Rudolph, you get back here! It's your turn. Gee, I got to go back. Would you walk home with me? Uh-huh... Rudolph. I think you're cute. I'm cute! I'm cute! Magnificent! I'm cute! I'm cute! She said I'm cute! Not bad. Not bad at all. Hey, you're OK. She said I'm cute! For crying out loud! Fireball, what's the matter? Get away from me! What's this nonsense here, bucks? After all--Aah! Hey, look at the beak. Hey, Fire Snout! Rainbow puss! Red schnoz! Stop calling me names! Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. Donner, you should be ashamed of yourself. What a pity. He had a nice takeoff, too. All right now, yearlings. Back to practice. Oh, no. Not you. You better go home. From now on, we won't let Rudolph join in any reindeer games. Right! Right! Rudolph? Rudolph? Well, what do you want? You promised to walk me home. Aren't you going to laugh at my nose? It's a handsome nose, much better than that false one you were wearing. It's terrible. It's different from everybody else's. But that's what makes it so grand. Any doe would consider herself lucky to be with you. Yeah? But I wasn't very lucky today, was I? I wish...

The world looked a lot more complicated and dangerous... than it seemed when they were snug and warm at home. The Abominable! He must see your nose. Quick, douse the light. Like I said, the outside world is up to its ears in danger. Well, somehow Rudolph and Hermey managed to get through the first night. Mush! Mush! Mush. Don't you understand North Pole talk? Mush. What's this? Hey, you get frostbit that way. Who are you? Who am I? The name's Yukon Cornelius, the greatest prospector in the North! This is my land, and it's rich with gold. Gold! Gold and silver. Silver and gold. Wahoo! Nothing. Silver and gold. What do you think of our friend Cornelius? Seems all he thinks about is silver and gold. ♪ Silver and gold ♪ ♪ Silver and gold ♪ ♪ Everyone wishes ♪ ♪ for silver and gold ♪ ♪ How do you measure its worth? ♪ ♪ Just by the pleasure ♪ ♪ It gives here on earth ♪ ♪ Silver and gold ♪ ♪ Silver and gold ♪ ♪ Means so much more when I see ♪ ♪ Silver and gold decorations ♪ ♪ On every Christmas tree ♪ What's a Christmas tree... without pretty silver and gold decorations?

I'll give you a lift. Hop aboard, mateys. Now, mush! Mush! Mush! Like this. Watch. Gadzooks! The Bumble Snow Monster of the North strikes again. It's my nose! It keeps giving us away. I hate noisy bumble snow monsters. We'll outwit the fiend with our superior intelligence. - How? - Douse your nose... and run like crazy! Come on! Wahoo! We're trapped. There's no way out! It's my nose again. It's ruined us. The bumble has one weakness, and I know it. Do-it-yourself icebergs. Observe: the bumble's one weakness. The bumble sinks. Yukon Cornelius scores again! Whoopee! Nothing. Mister, where are we going? You'll stay with me. We'll all be rich with the biggest silver strike... this side of Hudson Bay. Silver! I thought you wanted gold. I changed my mind. Our friends were really on their way, but not one of them knew where they were going. You can bet old Donner felt bad about the way he had treated Rudolph. He knew the only thing to do... was to go out and look for his little buck. Mrs. Donner wanted to go along, naturally, but Donner said, "No, this is man's work." No sooner did the man of the house leave... when Mrs. Donner and Clarice decided to set out on their own. Now, they were really taking their chances because, you see, that little ice boat... had run into a pack of mighty wicked fog. Hello! The fog is thick as peanut butter. - You mean pea soup. - You eat what you like. I'll eat what I like. Land ho! No kidding. Well, where are we? Hey! Looky up there! Oh! Halt! Who goes there? Us, of course. Well, then that's OK. OK? Who, may I ask, are you? We're Rudolph, Hermey, and Yukon Cornelius. Who are you? I'm the official sentry of the Island of Misfit Toys. A jack-in-the-box for a sentry? Yes. My name is-- Don't tell me. Jack. No. Charlie. That's why I'm a misfit toy. My name is all wrong. No child wants to play with a charlie-in-the-box, so I had to come here.

Maybe we could stay for a while. You'd have to get permission from King Moonraiser. Who's he? He rules here. Every night, he searches the entire earth. When he finds a misfit toy, one that no girl or boy loves, he brings it to live here till someone wants it. He's holding court in his castle right now. Come closer. What do you desire? We're a couple of misfits from Christmas Town, and now we'd like to live here. No. That would not be possible. This island is for toys alone. How do you like that? Even among misfits, you're misfits. Unlike playthings, a living creature cannot hide himself on an island. But, perhaps, being misfits yourselves, you might help the toys here. Help them? Yes. When someday you return to Christmas Town, would you tell Santa about our homeless toys? I'm sure he could find children who would be happy with them. A toy is never truly happy until it is loved by a child. When and if we ever get back, we'll tell Santa, sir. Good. You are free to spend the night. Footman! Show our friends to their chambers. No. It's all settled. We leave tomorrow together. But the Abominable will see my nose and get us all. I've got to go alone. Nonsense. It's all for all... I mean, one... Ah, let's get some shuteye. - But-- - It's all settled. Well, poor Rudolph realizes... that he can't endanger his friends' lives anymore. And so, that night, he decides to strike out on his own. Good-bye, Cornelius. I hope you find lots of tinsel. Good-bye, Hermey. Whatever a dentist is, I hope, someday, that you're the greatest. Well, time passed slowly. Rudolph existed as best he could. The snow monster kept him on the run... but once in a while, he would stop and make a friend or two. But it wouldn't last long, and Rudolph would be on his own. But during all that time, a strange and wonderful thing was happening. Rudolph was growing up, and growing up made Rudolph realize you can't run away... from your troubles. And pretty soon he knew where he had to go: home. You! I thought you were gone for good. Hey, look who's back: old Neon Nose! Mom? Pa? I'm home! They're gone, Rudolph. They've been gone for months looking for you. Clarice? She's gone, too. I'm very worried. Christmas Eve is only two days off, and without your father, I'll never be able to get my sleigh off the ground. Gone? I'll find him, sir. I'll find them all. Well, he was just about to leave when suddenly... It hit! The storm of storms, and only two days before Christmas Eve. Rudolph knew that he had to find his folks right away, and he knew where he had to look: the cave of the Abominable Snow Monster. Put her down! Tell me when it's over. Oh, where was I? Their last chance. Not quite. You see, ever since Rudolph left them, Hermey and Yukon Cornelius had tried to find their friend. They arrived in Christmas Town just as the storm hit. It was a good thing that I sent them right out after Rudolph. Hey, look! Whoa! Unmush, will you? What do we do? We can't let that monster get ahold of them. I got an idea. Listen. - Yes. - And then... Not bad. It might work. Why doesn't he get it over with? Pa? Ma? Clarice! Are you sure we can get him out? Never knew the bumble snow monster yet... who'd turn down a pork dinner for deer meat. Do your stuff! Oink oink. Put some heart in it! That bumble's hungry! Wahoo! Terrible weather we've been having. Snow and ice. All right, dentist, you take it from here. It's Yukon Cornelius! Ta-da! In person. We're saved! Let's get outta here. I'll light the way. Why, blast your hairy bumble hide. Don't let this big blowhard scare you anymore. Just walk right past him. I tell you, you're looking at a mighty humble bumble. He's nothing without his choppers. Let me at him. Wahoo! Yukon! He's gone! Oh, he's gone! Well, they are all very sad at the loss of their friend, but they realize that the best thing to do... is get the women back to Christmas Town. So they make it back and when everybody hears their story, they start to realize... maybe they were a little hard on the misfits. Maybe misfits have a place, too. Even Santa realizes that maybe he was wrong. Rudolph, I promise, as soon as this storm lets up, I'll find homes for all those misfit toys. All right. You can open up a dentist office. Next week, after Christmas. Come here. Open your mouth. Oh, dear. I'll set up an appointment for you: week from Tuesday, 4:30 sharp. I'm sorry, too, Rudolph, for the way I acted. Open up! It isn't a fit night out for man nor beast! Here's the man... and here's the beast! Now, calm down. I reformed this bumble. He wants a job. Looky what he can do. And he doesn't even need a stepladder. But... but... you went over the side of the cliff. Didn't I ever tell you about bumbles? Bumbles bounce! Well, as good as everyone feels, this is no time for celebrating... because the next day is Christmas Eve-- the biggest day of the year. Eat, Papa, eat. How can I eat? That silly elf song is driving me crazy. You're going to disappoint the children. They expect a fat Santa. Latest weather report, sir. Well, this is it. The storm won't subside by tonight. We'll have to cancel Christmas. Papa, are you sure? Everything's grounded! Oh, the poor kids. They've been so good this year, too. But I couldn't chance it. I'll have to tell everybody that it's all off this year. Quiet! Quiet! Please, everybody quiet! I've got some bad news, folks. Christmas is going to be canceled. There's nothing I can do. This weather-- Rudolph, Rudolph, please! Could you tone it down a bit? I mean, that nose of yours. That nose! That beautiful, wonderful nose! - Huh? - Rudolph, Christmas is not off, and you're going to lead my team. I am? Yes, sir. You and that wonderful nose of yours. My nose, sir? From what I see now, that'll cut through the murkiest storm they can dish up. What I'm trying to say is... Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight? It will be an honor, sir.
