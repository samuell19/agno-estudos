Hello? I... I don't feel safe here. I feel scared. Where are you now? Someone is here. Faster! - Where is it? - I don't have it. Don't waste my time! I don't have it! Give it to me! Open the bag! Don't! Don't take my things! Give it back! Hornet That isn't yours. Mission: Retrieve 100K You can't take what's not yours. Mind your own business. Thank you. Thank you for saving my life. Thank you for helping me. I'm not helping you. I'm helping myself. What? Please give that to the police. Save the world. Save the world? That was my dream. Please do not do this for the money. I'm doing this for the money. One last time. Please. Give it to the police! Save the world! Give it to the police. I'll pick you up at the cross junction. I'll take a little longer since I'm not used to right-hand drive. Got it. Just hurry. Mother: Gotten the 100k? Hornet: Need you ask? Mother: Good at what you do, as always Hornet: Thanks for everything Mother: Sure you're calling it quits? Hornet: Can't help it. We want different things. I'm tired! Mother: Good luck then! Hornet: Drop-off for the 100k? Mother: Wild Dog will meet up with you. Bye! Mother: Don't hide, flee! Mark, where's the sniper? - Mark, Hornet's partner - Give me a minute. How odd. This doesn't make sense. You can't even smuggle fake guns into Singapore. Why would there be real ones? Hold on, I'm tracking him down. Got him. It's Wild Dog. Don't tell me Mother sent him? Darned Mother! Kill Hornet. You hear me? Yes, Mother. Darn it! He's trying to shoot down my drone. Don't blame me then. Watch me. Bro, can you hear me? The coast is clear. - What was that about? - Nothing. It was tit for tat. All right! Just go. That was over the top. You're scaring the locals. Relax. Their prime minister always tells his people that they are to expect terrorist attacks so Singaporeans are well prepared mentally. Don't worry. I thought you told the syndicate that this was your last mission. Why did Mother want you dead? It's all right. Since they're not keeping their word, we won't either. Now that we've gotten the 100K, I won't hand it over to them. She forgot that we're hitmen too. Taipei I'm impressed that you could find a buyer so quickly. This tiny thing is worth US$10 million? Mark. You didn't have to take the risk and quit the syndicate with me. It's tiring to be on the run. How can you say such things? We're best buddies. We've been through so much and to hear you say that... You hurt my feelings! How about splitting the US$10 million equally? You idiot! All right. It's just you and me here. Out with it. Why quit when everything's going well? When I first started I thought I could save the world by getting rid of a few scumbags. But I soon realised there were just too many scumbags to kill. I'm tired. That's it? That's it. - That's it? - That's it. - Don't you have a better reason? - No. Hey, where are you meeting the buyer? Penghu. What's his name? Grandma. Gosh! Is that a tornado? My goodness! We'll encounter tornadoes on a daily basis from now on. - Why is that? - They want me dead because I quit. Now that you've quit too, they'll finish both you and me. So, be prepared. Qingshui District Taichung Mother! Got their final location. Fuxing Hotel. Latest news from the Philippines. Kun Sha, a terrorist that had infiltrated the Home Affairs Department engaged in a gunfight with the police yesterday. Kun Sha got shot and died on the spot. And his beloved daughter, Talia, has already fled the country. According to reports, Talia holds vital information on terrorist activities in various parts of Asia. And she might launch terrorist attacks all over Asia in retaliation for her father's death... Hi! Welcome to Fuxing Hotel. - May I have your name? - Mark. Mark. All right. All right. Would you and your boyfriend prefer... He's not my boyfriend. Would you and your husband prefer two single beds or one king-size bed? He's not my husband either. Two single beds, please. Sure. Okay, you'll have a king-size bed which can be separated into two single beds. I hope you're satisfied with our service today. Oh yes. Could you rate my service, please? - Sure. - Thank you. Needs improvement This is your room for tonight... Mark. Oh my. You don't recognise me? I'm Dumbo from Malaysia. Your classmate, Dumbo. Dumbo? I haven't seen you in a long while. Why are you here? I came here to find myself. Who lost you? I lost myself. Dumbo. You haven't changed a bit. You still talk as if you're acting in those old movies. Not that I'm bragging, but after graduation people often say I look like Qin Han (Taiwanese actor). But I refuse to accept that. So, I came to Taichung to reminisce memories from those romance movies in the '70s. Once I find the right location I'll become Qin Han. How sweet. You two are so loving. We have a video conference later. Dumbo, let's catch up some other time. Hey, come off it already. When's your big day? Please! He is not my boyfriend. You can't hide the truth forever. Hello? Are you Ira? Yes, I'm Ira. Is it safe to talk now? So long as we keep it within 60 seconds. Where are you now? I'm reaching the hotel. Have you checked in yet? I'm already in the room. My room number is 1288. Good. Be careful. Don't open the door to anyone. - I'll be right there. - Oh yes, have you seen Aunt Anita? Do you have 100K? Talia, I had wanted to tell you this when we met... well, it's possible that she's met with trouble. What happened to her? I haven't been able to contact her. But it's okay. Even if they got hold of 100K they can't do anything without your decoder. I know that, but... You still have the decoder, haven't you? Yes, it's with me. Please hurry. I'm scared being alone here. Hello? Tomorrow at 9.00am? Change of location? Noted. Is that Grandma? If we're not going to Penghu we won't to see the beach and women in bikinis. Just how much important information is in this thing? Why are there so many people after it? Listen. Wear this get-up tomorrow. Don't forget the accessories. Especially this. It's important... - What are you doing? - Checking the content. Be careful with it. It's worth US$10 million. Are you an idiot? I want to see what's in there. It could worth 10 times of US$10 million. Or even US$1 billion. Darn. From where did you get all these clothes? You're impressed, aren't you? They've already inserted the card. How attentive. It's hot in here. It looks like a room that Qin Han and Brigitte Lin had stayed in before. I feel like I've travelled back in time. Out you come. You can't get anything out from there. All that work for nothing. So much for being impressed with yourself. Shut up. The professional is at work here. You're such a slow coach. - I'm not. - Move faster, will you? This is really heavy. Why don't you carry it instead? Who are you? Who am I? I've been living here for the longest time. Yet you don't recognise me? What a useless guard! (Speaks gibberish) AR KaraDrama is going to start soon. For those who love to act, get ready. We're starting soon. Your co-star will start reading her lines. Yu-xuan, wherever you may roam I'll be here waiting for you Yu-xuan, wherever you may roam I'll be here waiting for you because your every smile has captured my heart. Han-yan. We met on a windy day. And without your permission I've kept you in my heart. I'm sorry. I've fallen for you. But my mother objects to us being together because she wants me to marry my cousin. Mother, Hornet's Leader Wild Boar, Mother's Personal Assistant Carry on being impressed with yourself. I'm going to take a shower. - Oh, shit. - What are you doing? You've just given our location away! Shit! Yu-xuan, you're crying. Every drop of your tears speaks for the struggles you've been through. Every drop of your tears makes me love you even more. I'll love you till the end of the world. Get ready to bawl your eyes out Holy shit! This character is so realistic. She's even wrapped in a towel. And there's no static noise. - Who are you? - Me? I'm Yu-xuan and you're my cousin. Hurry up! Hurry! Keep up! I can't eject the thumb drive. Mother, slow down. Wait for me. Keep up. Over here. Hurry. Listen up. Eight minutes. We only have eight minutes to do this. Right, the police will arrive in eight minutes. Sometimes, it only takes them seven minutes. Sometimes, nine minutes. - Which room is it? - 12th floor. Third room from the right. Could this be the adult version? - Drop the towel! - Stay away from me! - Kiss me right here. - Stay away from me! - Where did that gunshot come from? - Someone knew we're here? - Why is this happening? - I think it came from next door. I see it. A bullet hole in the window. This game is amazing! I'm not part of your game! Pack up! We have to go! Let's get him. Mother, which room is it? Which room is Hornet in? Tell me. Third room from the right. Gosh! What's going on? - Where are they? - Mother, you said the third room. - Which floor was it again? - Idiot! 12th floor! Oh no, they're here! What should I do? Take a shot! Mother and her team are here. They know we're here. Ready, get set... go! There's really a bullet hole in the window. They found me. You're real. Why do you have a gun? Now! Mother, I can't figure which room it is. I'll shoot at both, okay? I think I can go now. Watch out! You stupid boar. Watch out! Stay down! Talia, I'm here. Boys, listen up. All of you will go up and kill Hornet. Retrieve 100K. Go now. I'll cover you! Hurry! I'll cover you. Get ready. Shoot! - Retreat! - Hurry! Run! Are you all right? - Are you all right? - I'm fine! - Do you have more weapons? - Yes, I do. - Is this a real gun? - Yes, it is. Move aside. Someone died. - Good job. - More dead people. Your room is right next to mine. And you've got guns. You know each other? Blow them up now. Goodbye, Hornet. - Why is this happening? - Darn you. I... I bought this on Singles' Day. It was cheap since there was a sale. So I got this. Hey, pal. I didn't know you had such a fetish. I put it on by mistake. Stop chit-chatting. Let's go. Thank you. Pal, this is so dangerous. What should I do? Take me with you. - Don't follow us and you'll be fine. - Move. - Go. - We'll leave too. Wait. Can I change out of these first? - Hurry! - Hey, you're wearing my clothes. Why is it not pink in colour? I'm feeling it now. I should get changed. It's been eight minutes. The police are really here. How punctual! Boys, retreat! The police are here! Retreat! Hurry! They're getting away. - Hey, officers... - Quit talking. Don't you know something serious just happened here? Stop slacking. Go lock the doors. Talia, are you ready? Gosh, I had so little time. Here, help me with this. Let's go. How did the police get here so fast? We can't stay here anymore. The police are here. Last resort. We'll go via the manhole. Hurry! It stinks! - The police are here. - It's filthy. - Which way do we go? - Let me see. This way. Move! - The decoder! - Quickly! Oh, shit. You guys are mean. You didn't tell me you were leaving. Oh yes! What were you doing in my room? No, you were in my room. We're running out of time! Hurry! Did you forget something? Return it to me. Three of you there! Get moving. Follow me. And your stuff will follow you. What the hell is this? A decoder for adult films? This is none of your business. Don't ask. Where do I drop you? How ungrateful. Getting rid of me after you got what you needed. Could you at least make some small talk with me? For example, you can ask me why I came to Taiwan. Why did you come to Taiwan? In which part of Taiwan do I drop you off? I don't like you! Those two girls have guns. And they were in your classmate's room. Who are they? I'm not sure, but when we were in school, he had always... I mean those two girls. I know where this is going. Sorry. I'm just joking, okay? When do we change into our disguise? And how much further? See, you need me after all. What's your name? Some call me Qin Han. Then, I beat them to a pulp. That's because Qin Han is a legend. When I find the right spot I'd be able to become Qin Han. And some call me Bruce Lee. Did you beat them up too? No, I wasn't their match. Actually, I do have a name. And it's much nicer. It's Dumbo. It suits you. - Mr Qin Han. - Yes? I heard both Qin Han and Bruce Lee had topped up gas at that petrol station up ahead. You should be able to reminisce the yesteryears over there. Really? Your car is running out of gas. You top up gas while I go take a leak. I can't hold it in anymore. Dumbo, leave me alone. Actually, you're free to go. Dumbo... Oh my. You... - What are you doing? - Get out of the car. Get out! The car isn't mine so you can take it. But can I have my bag? It's a gift from my boyfriend. He'll berate me if I lose it. Shut up! Ask your boyfriend to buy you a new one. I won't buy her another bag. - Dumbo. - Come back! Okay, sorry. - Who is he? - I'm her boyfriend. Stop searching. The thing you want is with me. Get out of the car. - Give me the car key. - No, I won't. Or I will shoot you. Take her home with us. - Dear. - Yes? Which is more important? The bag or me? The bag. Darn it! Okay. Fine. I hear you. Here's what you'll do. Apologise to my girlfriend and return her the bag. And then, I'll let the matter rest. What the hell? You must be kidding! I'm holding a gun, mind you. Are you tired of living? Your gun is in my hand now. What can you do about it? Apologise to her. I dislike violence. I repeat. I dislike violence. Apologise to her now. Understand? I don't like violence either and I don't want to apologise. And I won't return the bag to her. What can you do about it? You're mimicking me. Fine, you leave me with no choice. I have only one option. Bruce Lee? Bruce Lee? Who is he trying to kid? Get him! Why must you force my hand? Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee Talia, are you all right? Go to hell! How dare you attack me from behind! Not dead yet? And you? Bloody idiot. Your bag is more important? - Here you go. - You're so awesome. You thought of keeping the car key right from the start. Awesome? More like he was afraid we might leave him behind while he went to the toilet. Hey. Return me my car key. If not for me, your car would be long gone. Jeez, they had the nerve to use fake guns! Dumbo! Dumbo! - Dumbo! - The cheek of him to play a hero. Dumbo! Hey! - Dumbo. - Yes? Why are you so skilled in kung fu? No wonder they call you Bruce Lee. Those were just some moves to fool those who don't know better. Hey, and what were you doing? You passed out and couldn't do a thing. Who are you to criticise me? Crazy woman. Enough. Stop arguing, you two. Dumbo, back at the hotel, are those two cute guys your friends? Two cute guys? You considered that fatty cute? He's a scum. You don't understand. He saved my life. Whoever saved you is cute? Then I must be awfully cute! Okay. Do you know the other cute guy? Anyway, that scum and I were classmates. I don't know the other guy. Hello? Is everything ready? Okay, we'll stick to the plan. See you later. Talia, a group of people will take you out to sea. They will protect you till you reach a safe place. Remember to keep your eyes peeled and stay alert. Stop focusing on just your makeup. Stop acting like a bimbo and feeling good about it. - You got it? - Come on, I'm a model. I make a living with my looks. Your looks won't matter when you're dead. Hey, how could you say that? Exactly. Boys, listen up. Hornet will be in disguise and it'll be hard to recognise him. Take more pictures. We have the facial recognition system to identify him. We must get rid of Hornet today and retrieve 100K. I'm meeting Grandma here instead. It's still early. Let's check the surroundings. - Mark, is this the right place? - Yes. Amen. Smells good, doesn't it? It smells really good. What happened to keeping a low profile? - Aren't we? - Are we? All the people here are looking at a monk that's donned in a monk's robe and eating braised meat rice. - Are they? - Can't you see? Look at all these people staring at us! Keeping a low profile, my foot! Couldn't you find us something else to wear? Don't worry, Mother. I have many other choices. We'll get changed right away. I really hate this disguise. This is the most annoying get-up. I have to be wary about Grandma. We have to stay under the radar to be on the safe side. Relax! I came up with this design. No one will recognise us. Are you impressed with me now? I'll ask you one more time. Have you turned off 100K's GPS signal? Yes, I have! Relax. I'm really hungry. Can we eat first? Let's plan our escape route first. Fine. There's a long queue. I bet the food is good! Let's go. Mark, set it up. It's so crowded here. Is there a need to? The safest place is the most dangerous. The more you think you don't need it, the more you need it. - Stop talking and start working. - All right. The best glutinous rice sausage in the world! I'll place the order. Come, there are seats over here. Grandma, team leader of a syndicate Team A, look carefully. The one in pink is Talia. Let me remind you. When you find her tell her you're from the CIA and take her away immediately. The van will come pick you up. Remember, I only want Talia. I don't want the other girl. Is that clear? What if she insists on following? Do you need me to teach you what to do? - No, Boss. - Remember, do not hurt the girl. Boss wants her alive. Understand? Yes. Boss, is this what CIA agents wear? Do you want to call and check with your mother? By the way, Boss, did Hornet arrange to meet you here? He chose this place. He thought he'd be safe meeting at a crowded place. But this is only true one hour later. This is what he looks like. Take a close look. He's quite good looking. He can star in idol dramas. I mean, you're handsomer. Mother, it's confirmed. They're Hornet and Mark. Boss, two sets, please. - Hello? - I'm Grandma from the CIA. - Where are you? - My men will be there soon. Hand over the girl and leave the rest to us. There are too many people here. We have to act fast to avoid unnecessary trouble. Okay, I understand. Can we eat now? Take note of your surroundings. Talia, get ready to go. But I've barely warmed the seat. And the food isn't here yet. Why has my friend become Chen Jin-pei (Taiwanese host)? Come. You said I had a fetish. Look who's talking now! - Cute guys! - Don't go! Come on! Did you think I couldn't recognise you guys? - You've got the wrong guy. - I saw right through your disguise! You look so adorable in this get-up! So cute! He could take part in the transvestite pageant in Thailand! Go away. - Hi. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Wait. I'm hungry. Let's grab something to eat. I can't work when I'm hungry. Join us. Talia, we have to leave. But I'm famished. Can you show me some concern? Don't you feel bad seeing that we're both so hungry? I'm not your tour guide. Are you coming or not? They will be here soon. I need to touch up my makeup. Sorry! I'm a model. Are you going to leave me behind me again? You're quick to do that whenever you get a chance. Get this. Qin Han had glutinous rice sausage here before. If you stay here, you'll start feeling you are him. Okay? Really? Don't say I didn't remind you. Do you feel safe handing Talia over to that stranger? Have you seen him before? Thanks for the reminder, Mr Busybody. Quit with your makeup. When you get shot dead you'll have your makeup done by the undertaker. Team A. Take action now. Roger that. Roger that. Mother! Get that girl! Darn it! The whole world was waiting for us here. Be careful. Who are those two men in black? Isn't that Hornet? You moron! Watch out! Retreat. Quick. Don't worry. Watch me. Change our disguise. Retreat! Boys, listen. That's a distraction tactic. Get up and go after them. Don't let them get away. Take note. They'll change their disguise. Charge ahead and finish them! Mark, where are you now? Report your location. I'm at a safe location. Boys, go get rid of them and retrieve 100K! Bro, Mother has a lot of men here. Be careful. There's a motorcycle near you. I'll start it now. - Get ready. I'll cover you. - Roger that. Remember, get out when you can. Stay away from trouble. Retreat! I don't want to die. Get ready to retreat. Take this gun. Hold it. Do you have a pink one? I feel like blowing off your bloody head. Thank goodness. I have my own. - Are you Talia? - Yes. I'm from the CIA. Follow me. - CIA! - Move! Let her go! Talia! Are you Grandma's men? Let her go! Bro, I'm throwing a smoke bomb. Leave now! Hurry. I'll wait for you inside. Hornet is behind us! Shoot him! - Where is Talia? - Let's go! Mark, cover me. Quick. I'm trapped. Fear not. I'll cover you. Go! Die! He's getting away. Quick, take out your secret weapon! - The secret weapon. - Here it is. Not this again? This is different. It cost much more. There won't be any problems. No problem at all. All right! Do it now. Firing! Not again! Mother, run! I can't trust you with anything. I'm out. You'd better get out too. If it's none of your business, don't get involved. Okay! I'll be right there. See you at the usual haunt. See you there. We want her alive! Get in the van! Get in! Get in! - Get her! - Stop her! Talia, I'm here! Talia! Sorry, I can't help you. - Come back here! - Please, let me go! Let me go! I have no beef with you. Help! Somebody, please! Help! Darned Fatty, don't try to run! Are you a man? Somebody, help! Fatty, what are you waiting for? Come help me! Am I destined to do this? - Help! - I'm coming! Dumbo, get in the van! Come on! Move faster! Enough! Didn't I say I wanted her alive? Thank you for saving me again. You're welcome. It's my pleasure. It's your pleasure? If she were ugly would you have saved her? How could you say that? I've also put my life on the line to save you. Can't you feel it? Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. My pleasure. Don't mimic me. Why were those men after your lives? Why were those other men trying to capture you guys? Why is it that no matter where you go someone is trying to kill you both? Why is it that no matter where you go someone is trying to catch you all? Gosh, stop repeating what I say and answer my questions. Darn, stop repeating what I say and answer my questions. Enough. Can you change the topic? If you don't come clean, I won't help you guys next time. Okay. It's a long story. - Keep it short. - To silence us. This is a tad too short. Elaborate a little. They killed my father. They killed my dad. And they won't stop coming after me because they... They're afraid she might take revenge in future. So they want to get rid of her. Okay, I get it now. So there's a group of people that's after you. And there's another group of people that's after you and your boyfriend. He is not my boyfriend! I heard that homosexuality is legal here. Being a hitman is illegal. Stop making wild guesses about my job. Keep that up and I'll kick you out of the car! See? You've just given yourself away. You are a hitman! That was my childhood ambition. I heard you could earn a lot and skip paying taxes. Show me the ropes. All of you, out! Get out or I'll shoot! Why are you chasing us out? Did I say something wrong? You went through a lot to save me... This is my childhood dream. I can be quite a talented hitman. Why did you get so worked up? Crazy fellow! Will it kill you to talk less? Look where you've landed us. Sir, it was really unexpected. They came with a bunch of... All I asked is for you to get one lady. One bloody lady. No, Sir. I suspect someone around her is from the special force. That's not my problem. Are you telling me you're not capable of doing it? No, Sir. Now you've alarmed her and it's making things more difficult! Boss. As for the 100K I've managed to find that person. Unfortunately the deal failed due to an unexpected shootout. I don't want excuses! The reason I hired you and your team to get the lady and 100K was because there were other fools out there who cannot do their jobs well. Do you understand? So we are not the only group? Yes! There are many groups out there with the same mission. And I'm going to give a big reward... to whoever gets that lady and 100K first. I need it badly. I need it badly. We'll get it first. Good. So is there any connection between the lady and 100K? Why are you asking? I'm just curious. Then don't ask. Just do your job! Sure. This female terrorist wanted by the Philippines government has fled to Taiwan a few days ago. Why is it that none of you has any leads on it? Sir, my informant has checked with the local gangs and it's confirmed that she hasn't contacted them. So I suspect the shootout at the market this morning is likely to be connected to her. Very good. According to the Philippines intelligence... I shall remind all of you once more this female terrorist is inclined to pretend to be clueless childish and ignorant. But the truth is, she can kill without batting an eyelid. She's already carried out a number of terrorist attacks in the Philippines. She's a highly dangerous criminal. So do we shoot her on sight? No. She has important information. The Philippines government wants to eradicate the entire syndicate. She's a crucial link. I want her alive. We'll try to crack the case soon. Good. It's been hard on you all. Thank you, gentlemen. Bro, a huge challenge for us. This is ridiculous. Ip Man (kung fu master) can defeat ten men all by himself. We've received professional training yet 12 of us were no match for those two. We even lost five men. A bunch of useless morons! Mother, during the shootout earlier, I noticed that there was another group of people going after Hornet. What's that about? How would I know? Now you know how sought-after 100K is. Our syndicate has already accepted payment from the client. If we can't find 100K do you think the syndicate will let us off? No, it won't. Look! The client is calling me. Hello? Yes, Boss. Boss, don't worry. My hitmen company is number one in the world. You talk to him. What am I supposed to say? Tell him if we fail to find the 100K we won't take his money. Boss. Yes. If we fail to get 100K for you you don't have to pay us. Yes? Okay, thank you, Boss. That's right. That's what we should tell him. That classmate of mine is really strange. One minute he went all out to save you the next minute he couldn't care less. How is it possible for someone to be so heartless? Yes, it's possible. Professional hitmen. Right. Fantastic. Mother, I've connected to 100K's GPS signal. - Get in the car! - All right! I don't see any cars around. That's because there's no signal here. Right. No cars will come even if there's a signal. Why? Because it's a place in a fog. Wow, you're talking in riddles. How knowledgeable. I'm stealing that from you. It's in my pocket now. - Looks like a car is coming. - Great! Really? An ambulance? Will they take us? They will, as long as one of us is hurt and lying on the ground. They're bound to stop. You! I let you do that only because you're a woman. I could've made a move quicker than you. You're bleeding! Don't clean it away. You know something? You really look like Qin Han now. Really? Really? - Hurry! Over here! - Someone is bleeding! How much longer to reach it? If the signal stays put, it'll take about half an hour. If it moves, it's hard to say. So what's the status of the signal? The signal is now... moving. Mark, are you here yet? I'm almost there. Gosh, those guys were so annoying. You seem impatient. What's up? It's But a Dream. You've got the girl, but you chased her out of the car? I was unlucky. I took the wrong bag. But you? You took the right one and lost it! Blaming me for your mistakes? I had to chase them out of the car because they found out we were hitmen. I did what I had to. It pained me to do it, all right? It pained you? Then why would Mother show up at the market and brought so many men with her? You told me you switched off the GPS signal, didn't you? Oh, right. I did switch it off. How did that happen? Darn it. If you enter the password remotely the GPS signal can be turned on again. Darn it. Didn't you know that? Well, I'm not familiar with it. - Hello? - I'm Grandma. Why can't I get through your phone? After what happened at the market earlier it was impossible to carry out our deal there. Is the deal still on? Yes, of course. I'll update you on the time and place again. Mark, I get a feeling that Talia is linked to 100K somehow. No way. You're reading too much into it. She told me that those people were after her because of her dad. Quick, check the location of 100K. I'll check the CCTVs nearby. - Look! - You've got it? Is there a signal? There's a CCTV upfront. Let me see what the car looks like. An ambulance? Why are they on an ambulance? I guess they're heading to the hospital. If we can track the GPS signal... So can Mother. Genius. Mother, 100K's GPS signal shows that it's right ahead. We'll reach it by heading in this direction. Cut the crap. Focus. Don't lose it again. You found the answer to such a difficult question. - So what's next? - I'll make sure she can't find it. Do it now. Hey. Why are we turning back? - Are we on the right track? - Yes, we are. Just follow the signal and we won't go wrong. Even the CIA uses this kind of tracking device. Don't worry. Wait a minute. I told you to track down 100K. What are we doing here? Well, we followed the signal. It led us here. That means 100K is here. We're getting closer to it. Hey. Why did the signal jump to the other side of town? What are you guys doing? All is well. Just follow the signal and we'll be fine. When the signal makes a turn, we make a turn too. Relax. The CIA also uses this kind of tracking device to track down terrorists. - Don't worry. - The signal is now on the right. - Make a right turn. - Okay. Oh dear! The signal jumped again. What's going on? They're trying to shake us off but we have a precise device. They can't get away. Quit talking. Make a right turn and go after it. - There's a car coming. - Make a right turn. - Hurry! - Make a right turn. Mark, how far are we from the hospital? We'll be there soon. Goodness gracious! The signal keeps jumping here and there! And we're going around in circles. If the Americans use this to go after terrorists don't they feel dizzy? I'm getting really dizzy now. Mother, look at this. Gosh, why are there so many signals? The signal could reproduce by itself? No freaking way! You idiot! We've been tricked! All these signals are fake! Hurry, get out of here. Go back to where we started. Is this the right route? Will Mother get there before we do? Impossible. I made them go in circles. Mother most likely wants to kill me now and make me into braised meat rice. That short fatty. If I get my hands on him I'll chop him up and make him into braised meat rice. Mother, I'm so confused now. Just where are we heading? Stop the car! I'm getting car sick! Find the right route before we proceed. Hey, get up. Let's get going. - Where are you going? - I'm fine now. I'm leaving. - He's fine now. - No. He has to get checked before he leaves. Come on. Lie down. Check the hospital's CCTV. They should be in the emergency room waiting to get checked. That's the standard procedure. They can leave anytime. Why did they follow the procedure? How stupid. Cut the crap. Check if you see anyone else at the hospital. Lie down. He doesn't need any treatment. - No, he can't go yet. - He's fine now. We'll get into trouble if he leaves just like that. Stop talking. We're going in. Boss, that woman is here at the hospital. - Come, quick. - You keep a lookout there. I'll be right over. You'll get hurt if you keep moving. Hello, Boss. Yes. Boss, don't worry. I... You speak to him. - What do I say? - Tell him this. This woman here will definitely get him 100K. Tell him stop calling and nagging at me. Sir. Yes, Sir. Your grandmother (my boss) says... 'Grandmother' means 'this woman here'. I see. Your grandmother says she will get you 100K. So your grandmother says you don't have to call her. She will call you, okay? Okay. Bye. - Okay? - Okay. Mother, have you met this client before? No. According to the syndicate he's an important figure so his identity has to be kept confidential. Kept confidential? I have no idea how important he is. But I don't see why we have to keep his identity confidential since we don't even know where to find him. Just get moving. Hurry. Faster. Darn it. Those men after Talia have already reached the hospital. How did they arrive before us? Didn't you mess with the GPS signal? Darn it. We have to deal with them at the hospital. How are we going to get Talia out? What are you doing? Where are you going? Yoo-hoo! Mother? I'm Little Hornet. Gosh, what's up? It's rare that you're calling me! Are you asking me out for a date? I just wanted to tell you that since we used to be colleagues I don't want our relationship to turn sour. How about we make a deal? I'll give you 100K and you let Mark and me go free. Let's part amicably, shall we? Come on, don't put it this way. You make it sound like we're strangers. Aren't we like mother and son? You also made it sound like I was so mean. If you behave yourself I'll be sure to shower you with lots of motherly love. I'll behave myself. You can be sure of that. So I'll give you 100K and we're even, okay? Hearing you say that actually makes me a little worried. It sounds too good to be true. I'll only believe you when 100K is with me and safely tucked away in my bosom. But get this, this is your last chance. Don't you play any tricks on me. If you do, I won't let you off even if it means crawling out of my grave. Deal. Let's meet at the hospital. Mark, send Mother 100K's GPS signal. - A-Are you crazy? - Hurry and send it over. - Are you sure? - Yes. What are you up to now? You're making known our whereabouts. There's going to be a war with everyone there. We'll be creating chaos at the hospital. The more chaotic it is, the easier for us to do our job. Listen up. Here's my plan. Only one signal left. Mother, take a look. Start the car. Follow the signal. I need to verify your identity. May I know your name? - My name is Dumbo. - Mr Dumbo. You have an injury on your nose. This is an ice pack. I'll show you how to use it. - Okay. - Hold it with your hand. Easy does it. Mark, check it now. Look, they're in disguise. Darn it. Don't tell me he's Grandma. Calling Grandma Bloody hell. He really is Grandma. The doctor will be here soon. All right. - Thank you. - Take care. I will. Let's go. I didn't think the doctor would come so soon. I thought I'd just go to the loo. Take them all. Leave no trace behind. Act fast. Relax. These three patients are gravely ill so we've arranged a special treatment for them. Take them away. Out of the way! They're heading towards the carpark. Look. They're really fast. Why isn't Mother here yet? Don't run beyond 15 metres. Beyond that, we'll die. That was how Kim Jong-nam died. What should we do then? Keep it at 14 metres. - What should we do? - It's Mother. Hi, Mother. I'll wait for you at the corridor near the east entrance of the carpark. Okay. Move. Show time. Hi, everyone. Mother, the person we're going to meet is known as Grandma. He stole 100K. I'll tell him to give it back but I bet he'll say "What nonsense are you talking about?" - Why is that? - To cause a rift between us. He's a devious one. Don't fall for his tricks. I'm way smarter than that. Mother. He's Grandma. You're Hornet? Yes. You're quite a looker. My stuff. Give it back. What nonsense are you talking about? - See? - You have the nerve to say that? Mother, the thing is with him. Go get it from him. You're supposed to give it to us, not the other way around. Okay. I can't do it alone, right? Calm down. You guys calm down too. This is... I'm tired of this. Seriously. I don't want 100K anymore. Fight it out among yourselves, all right? Plus, a reminder for everyone. This is a hospital. Patients need to rest. Remember, do not shoot. Do not shoot. Good night. Be careful. Don't hurt our own. Do not shoot. Over here. Do not shoot. Do not shoot! - Who hit me? - I don't know. Who did that? Oh, it's you, Mother. Which bloody idiot hit my head? I don't know who, but surely it wasn't me. - It was you. - No, it wasn't me. Go. Get in the van. - Get in the van. - Wake up. Wake up. Get in the van! It hurts. Hello? Yes, Boss. No problem. - Let me. - You get Dumbo. Come on. I've been waiting for you. Get in the van. 100K will be in your hands soon. 100K is coming to you. He's hung up. - We can't let Hornet get away. - Okay. Let's go! Quick! Stop! Attention, all units. A shootout is taking place at Section 2, Ren'ai Road. Both parties are heavily armed and they're firing away. Proceed to the scene immediately to evacuate the public and maintain order. We're equal in strength. What do we do? Fear not. We have a sniper up there. Smart boy. But I think he's dead now. - Sir, you're here. - Yes. What's happening? We're fighting. That girl is running away. I want her back right now. I know. We're trying very hard now. Sir, get out now. - It's dangerous. - No. My car is bulletproof. Get out now! Mother, look. I think this guy is a buyer from overseas. I believe 100K is with him. We can't let him get away. Go take cover! Move over there! Take cover! Take cover over there! Who's calling? What a time to call. It's that moron again. Hi, Boss? Wait. Tell him that we're getting close to 100K. Tell him, quick. 100K will be in your hands soon. So irritating. Please stop calling. Any more weapons? Leave it to me! Watch me! Guys, cover me! Put down your guns! Put them down! - Put down your guns. - Put them down. Mother! Come, quickly. They're all here. You're such a genius. - You bought these online? - Yes. They didn't explode but yet you got them? - Right. - A real genius. Grandma. Aren't you a smart one? Give me 100K! - I don't have it. - How dare you deny it! I see you have nerves of steel. How dare you stand up! I bet you're the buyer. Don't pretend you don't understand. - What? - 100K. Give it to me. Cut the act, will you? I'll... - Mother, let me. - Fine, you do it. - Drop your act already. - Okay. Okay? Wait. - Get 100K from him. - Got it. Give it to me. Hello? Hello, Boss? 100K is in my hands. Very good, Mother. Mother. Did you just call me Mother? You are... Adolf. Your boss! Hello? Hello? Put down the guns. You're the boss? Now, onto world news. Taichung has recently seen... The Philippines government announced that... The terrorist leader Kun Sha who had infiltrated the Home Affairs Department... Talia is most likely the terrorist from the Philippines who's responsible for a spate of terrorist attacks in Taichung. After engaging in a shootout with the police, they were shot dead. It's said that Talia possesses many deadly weapons. It's possible that she might launch another terrorist attack. S-So many cockroaches! The public is advised to stay vigilant. If you see any suspicious looking person report to the relevant authorities immediately. No. Don't push me, okay? Don't push me! I can walk by myself. Where's the other group? They escaped, Boss. I want them back. Get them. Yes, Sir. You have a very simple mission. And yet you failed? - Did you get that? - I only have one rule. You fail... you die. No! - Boss, don't kill me. - No. Don't kill me, Boss. - Translate it for me, quick! - Okay, I'll translate that. Tell him I'm still young. - She's still young. - Tell him I'm waiting for love. She wants to marry... She wants to fall in love with you. Tell him I want to get married. She wants to marry you. Most importantly, tell him I'm a virgin. - Hurry! - She's still a virgin. She wants to give you her virginity. - Virgin? - No. 30 years ago. No. 40 years ago. What did you say to him? I told him what you wanted me to say. Well, tell him I can sing. She can sing. Tell him I can dance. She wants to die for you. What did you say? D-I-E is die. I understood that. Oh. She wants to dance with you. Dancing. Dancing. Hey, stop. Tell him I can cook. She wants to cook for you. She can cook very delicious food. - Yummy. - Yummy. Now, tell him this. He's in Taiwan. He needs someone to help him. And I'm that person. Sir, now you're alone in Taiwan. You'll get very lonely so you need a local to give you a leg and a hand (lend a hand). Wait, what do you mean, a leg and a hand? That's how we say it in the Taiwanese language, right? A leg and a hand (lend a hand). Is that how you should say it in English? Yes. A leg and a hand. - A leg and a hand? - Is that correct? Yes, it's correct! A leg and a hand. He's laughing. That means I'm correct. A leg and a hand. He laughed just now. Thank goodness I can speak English. Good. Now the police are working hard for me. If not for the disguise, I would've been caught. Eat up and put on our disguise. Do you have to make me so ugly? Will they recognise us right away? Relax. Who can recognise us now? If someone does, I'll get run over by a car. Our syndicate is very skilled in the art of disguise. Quit talking. Let's move fast. The bus station is right ahead. Terrorist attacks are rampant lately. After the shootout at Ziqiang Market there also has been an intense shootout at a hospital. According to police investigations Talia, the female terrorist from the Philippines, is most likely to have collaborated with terrorists hiding in Taiwan in these attacks. Based on reliable sources these five suspects are masters of disguise. Police have deduced that they're likely to adopt the following disguise. Please have a look. How would the police know that? I bet Mother tipped off the police. Can't be helped. We've been trained the same way. Could the syndicate have relocated the supplies station because we quit so that we can't find it? No way. They're not that efficient. See? I believe it's right ahead. Guys, we'll take a break here. But it's not safe. We have to leave soon. Understand? Careful, those at the back. Watch your steps. Over here. Tell us honestly. Just what is in 100K? We're so worn out because of it. I think we should tell them. Talia's father was my commanding officer. He saved my life once. After retiring, he joined the Internal Security Department. A few months ago, he discovered a name list by accident. A list of all the terrorists that have infiltrated in government agencies all over the world. Before he died, he saved all the important data into 100K. This caused panic in terrorists all over the world. They're afraid they might be exposed. You might be disappointed to hear this. There's nothing in there. How do you know that? Don't tell me 100K is with you? Yes. It's with me. What about my aunt? Is she alive? She was hunted down and got injured. She was drenched in the rain. She might catch a cold but she'll survive. How did 100K end up with you? I was sent to Singapore to retrieve 100K. I wasn't the only one who was after it. We got into a fight and I won. That's why it's with me now. 100K belongs to me. Please return it to me. There's nothing in 100K. What do you need it for? You can't see anything because you don't have the decoder. Decoder? Is it to spread the risk? That's right. To spread the risk Talia's father put 100K in her aunt's care while Talia holds on to the decoder. Besides the name list there's evidence of their money laundering activities. My father planned to hand this information to the government. The terrorists learnt about it and ordered a hit on my father. They're all out to get me in order to get hold of the decoder. The terrorist we're referring to... is Adolf. He's a drug lord. He's connected to high-ranking Pinoy officials. Plus, he enjoys diplomatic immunity. His earnings from drug deals are channelled into supporting terrorism. He's a dangerous two-faced man. Actually, the Philippines government are already investigating him. What the hell! You were working for the terrorists for the sake of money! We were working for our syndicate. We don't question the clients' agenda. This is the rule we professional hitmen follow. The rule? You didn't even know what your clients were up to and you went ahead with your missions. Do you realise that your actions are not very much different from those merciless terrorist acts? And do you also know that you're going to kill millions of people? That's why I said I was tired. That's why we quit. - That's it? - Yes. The syndicate is not happy that we quit so they came after us to have us killed. Now you know what's going on, so quit with your questions, okay? Both of you, stop quarrelling! 100K doesn't belong to you. Can you return it to us now? You're hesitating? I know! Are you planning on selling it to Adolf... Shut up! Talia, if I give you 100K my mission is accomplished. That means we'll go our separate ways. No can do! You can't leave me... I mean, leave us behind. 100K and the decoder hold the lives of many. It's not just about you and me. We have millions of lives to save. Everyone has a part to play. How can you leave just like that? That's not what I meant. What I'm saying is, we have to break up into smaller groups. We won't have a chance travelling in a big group like this. I don't care. You have to protect us. We have to hand over 100K and the decoder to the right person which is the CIA agent. Upon doing that, you may then leave. We need to be at the assigned location in two days' time and hand over 100K and the decoder to the CIA agent. Ira, are you sure we're meeting up with the right guy this time? We won't get it wrong again, will we? My guys have confirmed it this time. It won't go wrong. You're doing it right this time. Ask your men. The CIA agent you were referring to is... Why not hand over 100K and the decoder to the police? We're not sure if any police officers are in the terrorist name list. We can't afford to make any mistakes. All right. Where are you meeting him? Kenting. Kenting? Are you sure? I think we'll get caught before we even get there. Actually, four of us is enough. Dumbo, you may leave. Are you dumping me again? Fine. I shall not hide it anymore. I'm a CIA agent. Hand over the things to me... Hey, guys... You forgot your bags. Hey, I'm serious. Remember to disguise yourselves. What the hell! Don't move! Where do you think you're going? Don't move! Where are you going? Don't move. We meet again. Darn, you follow wherever we go. Cut the crap. Hand over 100K and the decoder. And then, we'll go our separate ways. You're presenting 100K to Adolf to atone for your mistakes? We're both the same paid to do our job. We are different although... - Shut up! - We're the same! Fancy you singing at a time like this. Everyone! My patience is wearing thin. Hand over the things now! Everyone is after you. - They must be with you. - No, they're not. - Hand them over! - I don't have them. Do you want me to search you? I dare you! Leave women out of this! Men shouldn't make women cry! Don't think you wear a wig and I can't recognise you! You're good at fighting, aren't you? Come on, let's fight! Aren't you a good fighter? Take me on! If you're so good, put down your gun and we'll fight. Darned you! If you're so good, fight with me while I hold the gun! Enough! Enough? Hand over the stuff and I'll stop. Where is it? Tell me now! It's not with us. Okay! I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Out with it. Now! Where you point your guns, I must say you're quite creative. I can show you more creative ways. All right. I'll talk. Darn it. It's with Mark. Darn it, bro. Don't mess with me! It's not with me! Keep quiet. It's with Mark. In his bag. Darn it! Don't let him get away! Get him! - Search him. - Fine. I'll hand it to you. Let me. Be patient. Here it is. 100K. Here it is. 100K. How can you prove this is 100K? Okay. Let me show you. What are you doing? Hurry up! Boss. Look, I found 100K. How can you prove this is 100K and the decoder? Hold on. Look. It's a bomb! Come on! Let's go! - Be careful. - Freeze! If you have the guts, fight me without your gun. I'm not going to put it down. Grab one too if you want. Put down your gun. Go to hell! I lost my gun. Come on! You got your gun back. That's my cue to run! Darn it. Be careful. - Are you okay? - Bro, are you okay? - He's hurt. - The police are coming! Let's get out of here. Quick! - Be careful. - Let's go. Bro, are you all right? Hang in there. I'm fine. This is retribution. No. No, it isn't. You saved my life. It hurts but I'll be fine. I'll be better after some rest. Don't... don't fall asleep. I don't think I can go on. Shall we hand 100K over to the police? Why isn't the CIA agent coming for me? Why is he making us go all the way there? Actually, the CIA agent is already here. Where is he? - Where is he? - Where is he? I'm a CIA agent. Quit joking around. I'm not joking. None of you believes what I said. Fine, you're a CIA agent. Prove it. Listen. When the CIA discovered that 100K and the decoder were in the same hotel in Taichung they sent me there to investigate. The CIA got me a room and told me to wait there. Hello? I'm outside the room but I can't unlock the door. Why should I do? Then, the door unlocked somehow and I could enter. Darn it. You guys are capable of anything. If I wasn't a CIA agent would I be able to go into your room so easily? And, when you fired at me I could dodge the bullet with much ease. If I hadn't received special training would I be able to do that? Then, when you stood up, I leaped over the bed to save you. There were hundreds of bullets flying by. That's beyond an ordinary man. And you. When I heard you were about to hand over Talia to Grandma I knew you had been hoodwinked. You may look pretty but you're not very bright. You said you're in the special force but you haven't done a thing right. It's true. Have you forgotten? When we were at the market I reminded you not to hand Talia over to them. But since you dislike me, you didn't believe me. Am I right? Try and recall. Then, when hell broke loose at the market, our bags got switched. Did you think that was an accident? No, it wasn't. I found an opportunity to grab your bag. I then hid among some boxes and checked your bag. I saw that 100K was really in there. At that moment, I knew I found both items. Do you believe me now? Come, hand me the stuff. The CIA can't wait to have them. You still have doubts? Fine. One more evidence. Remember what happened at the petrol station? The CIA planted the robbers there. It was to show you how good a fighter I am. To prove that I could be useful to you. I see. No wonder you were so bold. The robber pointed the gun at you, yet you took the gun from him. You're despicable. Can't help it. I was forced to be despicable to save my baby. When Mark chased us out of the car you had 100K and Talia had the decoder. Why didn't you take it from her and leave? Well, I couldn't. Have you forgotten? We were at that secluded place. And you even punched me in the face. That's not what an ordinary man could put up with. Why didn't you say so earlier? Gosh, I did but none of you believed me. I tried to tell you earlier but still, none of you believed me. That's so typical of human beings. Only when you're left with no other options then you would be quiet and listen. So where are the things? Hand them to me now. The CIA is getting impatient. Hurry. You still don't believe me? Give them to me now! The police are coming! What if another Grandpa or Grandma comes along? What would you do? Okay. Tell me. If you don't hand them over to me what other alternatives do you have? Tell me. I believe you. Here's 100K for you, CIA Agent. Talia, where's your decoder? I'm left with no other options. So that's your safe box? I choose to believe you. Pal, we believe you. You'd better not mess with us. Thank you for trusting me. I'll contact CIA right away. Hello? Hello, I'm the agent from Malaysia... Hello? I forgot to pull up the antenna. Hello? This is the agent from Malaysia. My code number is MSL0087945. So... the banana and durian are with me now. I want to Char Kway Teow (a Malaysian dish) with you now. This is the secret code between Malaysian agents and the CIA. What? The CIA's network got hacked? So what do we do now? T-They said just hand them over to the police. Here comes the delicious food. Boss! Taiwan's number one delicacy. This is pork. Delicious. Boss. This is Taiwan's number one stinky tofu. It's very good. Delicious! This is chicken. After cutting away... Boss. Look. The police are here. They are here for us. Call the embassy now. Sir, the embassy just called. They asked you to cooperate with the Taiwan police. They cannot help you anymore. - Get ready to fight. - Okay, Boss. Where are my things? No problem. Come. The secret weapons. Hurry. Boss. - What is this? - This? When the police see this, they will cry. Good. All units, move out. Team Two, get ready. Go. Go. Salute! Hurry! Hurry! This way! SWAT Team, please respond. What's the situation? Commander, we're carrying out a search now. I know you're over there! Show yourselves! Come out! Commander, we found five suspects with explosives tied on them on the balcony. Roger that. You're in command now. Roger. Okay, proceed. Hands up! Get on the ground! No! Drop your weapons. - All of you, put down your weapons! - Okay. All of you, put down your weapons. Okay, sir. I've dropped my weapon. Please calm down. Drop your weapons and come with us. No! My job isn't finished yet. Can't you see? We are all rigged to this detonator! - Yeah! - Okay, I know! Just calm down. Do you know how powerful this is? I know. Just calm down. Once I press this we will all go down with this building. - Yeah! - Okay, I know. Take it easy. Sir. Everything is over. Put that down and come with us. - Back off! - Back off! All of you, move back! - Okay. - Move back! - Okay. - All of you, move back! I want a chopper. Okay. You got the chopper, no problem. I said I need the chopper right now. - Okay. Calm down. - I want the chopper right now! Go! Where are you, Mother? I'm going to kill you! This Adolf finally got a taste of my prowess. What exactly is this? The explosives were sold out. I could only get fireworks. They were really cheap so I bought them all. You bought all of their fireworks? Didn't we say we'd blow them up? What's this? New Year's Day party? Isn't it a pretty sight? May we be prosperous and at peace. Happy and prosperous New Year Most Wanted Man: Adolf Arrested by Taiwanese Police International Terrorist Organisation Asia's Most Wanted Man: Adolf We owe it to these two anti-terrorist heroes. They fought the terrorists head on and were undaunted by the dangers. Because of that, we managed to crack the case promptly and put a stop to terrorist attacks all around the world. With a big round of applause let us welcome our anti-terrorist heroes Talia and Dumbo! Thank you! I think Dumbo hid his identity from the police on purpose so that he could receive the medal on stage. - Shame on him! - You want the medal too? - Go up on stage! - Shut up. Count ourselves lucky for not getting caught by the police. Forget about getting a medal. Let's invite the Commissioner to present the medals. Once again, thank you, our anti-terrorist hero, Talia! We've saved more than we killed. We've atoned for our sins. Thank you, our anti-terrorist hero, Dumbo! Anti-terrorist Heroes Cheers. It's Dumbo. - Hi! - Hello! Ta-da! I've cut my hair and changed my style. Behold! Do I look good? You look ugly! I heard you guys are on vacation. Yes, we are. Aren't you looking for something? Yes. I've found it. I found a place that I could connect with. Where is that? I'll send you some pictures. Look, don't I look very much like Qin Han now? - Yes, very much so. - Indeed. I realised something. The events that happened to us lately were just like the plots of those movies in the '70s. - What are you talking about? - What do you mean? I'll tell you, but keep it from the girls. I don't want them to think the worst of me. Okay? Promise? Sure. I promise. I promise. I promise. Okay, here it goes. Look, I like Talia but she doesn't like me. And Mark carries a torch for Talia but Talia doesn't fancy him. Talia likes you, Hornet but you don't like Talia. You like Ira but Ira isn't reciprocating. Now, here's the most important part. Ira is secretly in love... with me! It's so romantic! We'll tell Ira on your behalf. No. I should tell her that myself. Here I come! Here I come! - Here I come! - He's indeed a CIA agent. How do you know we're here? Look, I've changed my hairstyle for you. I hope you like it. Let's fall in love. What the hell! Are you crazy? What makes you think she's fallen for you? Haven't you watched pop idol dramas before? The man and woman who are always squabbling and loathing each other will end up as lovers. Right. - We love you too. - Yes! You'll give us your blessings, right? Off you go! I used to think I could save the world by killing a few bad guys. Through the recent event we saved many lives unwittingly. Now the global superpowers are stopping violence with violence. Is that really the only way to save the world today? Maybe I'm overthinking here.
