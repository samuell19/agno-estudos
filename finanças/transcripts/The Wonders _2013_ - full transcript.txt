Keep an eye out... -Ok. ﻿Shmaya, where are you? ﻿Is it over? Can I go home? Home? ﻿You know what you have to do first... ﻿They're moving him again. ﻿I don't know. ﻿Maybe we should act... ﻿or, keep watching... ﻿Watch your head... ﻿Hurry... ﻿Arnav! ﻿What's the damage? ﻿What did you have? Two and three. ﻿The two are on me. ﻿75 shekels. -75?! ﻿Your prices went up, Arnav. ﻿We should start an action committee. ﻿CRAP - The Committee for Reduction of Alcohol Prices. ﻿I'm ten shekels short... ﻿What's it gonna be, Cavilio? ﻿I spend all my tips on you. ﻿I end up leaving you a tip. ﻿You're a saint, Arnav. A saint. ﻿Bless your soul. -Good night. -Good night. ﻿Check please... ﻿Corning. ﻿Makes me mad that people here feel free to grab you. ﻿This is a bar, not a convent. ﻿Table 4 wants a last round of beer. ﻿Will do, your hottie holiness. ﻿Stop staring at me. ﻿I'm serious about turning religious. ﻿You were serious as a punk rocker... ﻿When you studied Chinese medicine... ﻿You're so annoying. ﻿I'm gonna start cleaning up. ﻿Wanna come over for coffee? -"Wanna come over for coffee"? ﻿If you want to lead me astray, you'll have to do better than that. ﻿You think I'm that easy? ﻿Makes me mad when you try to distance me from sainthood. ﻿On the contrary. When you come over, ﻿sainthood is in the hood. ﻿And Peter Piper picked pickled peppers. -Not funny. ﻿And Suzy sells seashore seashells. ﻿Stop it. It won't get you anywhere. ﻿Check out that car. ﻿You'll never have a car like that. ﻿Why? I'll pull double shifts at the bar... ﻿Forget it, you're a penniless graffiti artist with no prospects. ﻿What's the problem? ﻿What's the problem? There's no peace in the Middle East. ﻿I'm overdrawn at the bank. I have pigeons in my window... ﻿Buzz off. ﻿What? -Don't get me started. Just buzz off. ﻿The kitchen is the other way. ﻿Weird... ﻿A fancy car like that in our neighborhood? ﻿Great, that means I'm the one making coffee. ﻿I can't believe I used to live with you. ﻿So strange... ﻿Mr. Buzz Off and his friends ﻿just went into the abandoned apartment ﻿Vax? ﻿What? ﻿What's that blue light? ﻿What are they, ultra-Orthodox aliens? ﻿What blue light? -Up there. ﻿Could be their cell phone lights... ﻿They're probably just dealers or junkies. ﻿Say goodnight to the aliens. ﻿I don't know what's with me lately. ﻿I see things... ﻿I'm such a pathetic loser... ﻿Sex with your ex is the lowest... ﻿Sorry, I didn't mean to... ﻿If I don't repent, I'll never find true love. ﻿I'm putting on some music. ﻿Good morning. -Good morning. ﻿Top of the morning, Mr. Weinberg. ﻿Top of the morning. ﻿Jolt me with java ﻿and egg on an egg sandwich, ﻿How's it going? ﻿Good morning, Mr. Aharonov. ﻿Good morning. -I hate to cut you off but... ﻿Cut... Get it? -Very funny. ﻿Is Cholera... Is Chaim out back? ﻿He's out back. ﻿Como estas, Cholera? ﻿Praise the Lord. Brown or green? ﻿What's the dish of the day? ﻿We have green from Sinai, cheap, ﻿but for our special clients we have hydro from Amsterdam. ﻿One puff and you'll be speaking Dutch. -Of course I wanna speak Dutch... ﻿Greetings and salutations... -Hello, how are you? ﻿Baklava, please. ﻿Here you go. ﻿How much is that? -Sixty. ﻿Two vodkas, neat. -With pleasure, your holiness. ﻿Arnav, don't forget me. ﻿Arak? Cognac? Whisky? ﻿You decide which order. ﻿What will you have? ﻿Shandy, please? ﻿Shandy? ﻿My blood sugar's low. ﻿Do you have anything else sweet? Baklava or something? ﻿Baklava? You came to the right place. ﻿Not just any baklava, it's Eiffel! ﻿Whoa, you mean Eiffel Sultan Suleiman? ﻿In its full Eiffleness... ﻿Respect to the baklava meister. -Respect. ﻿You drive all the way to Sultan Suleiman for baklava? ﻿Drive? I live here in Musrara, across the street, ﻿you know where the art school is? -You go to school there? ﻿I did - painting and multimedia. ﻿But all that sitting in class, discipline, raising your hand, ﻿not for me. ﻿Arnav! There's a hole in my glass. ﻿What did he call you? ﻿Arnav. Nice to meet you. ﻿Your name is Arnav (rabbit)? ﻿Long story. My birth certificate says Ariel Navon, ﻿in 1 st grade I was Arnavon, Arnaviko, Arnaviyahu... ﻿Arnav! -Yeah, what now? ﻿What now? I had my Arak, and what comes after Arak? ﻿Cognac! -Cognac! ﻿Arnav, wait a second! ﻿It's you? ﻿What's wrong with you? ﻿You scared me. ﻿Isn't it against the law to deface walls? ﻿Paragraph 9 of the Penal Code: ﻿"He who writes, paints, ordraws illegally ﻿on another's property ﻿is liable to one year's imprisonment." Is it worth it? ﻿You a cop or something? ﻿Luckily for you, not anymore. ﻿So what do you want from me? ﻿I have a proposition for you. ﻿I couldn't say it with people around. ﻿Man, baklava is no problem, but there are things I'm not into. ﻿I need your apartment for a week's surveillance. ﻿So it wasn't all my imagination. ﻿Are they still in the abandoned apartment? ﻿Does it matter? ﻿I don't want any trouble. ﻿Someone's locked in there, and needs help. ﻿So, call your old job and have them send a cruiser? ﻿It's not that simple. ﻿What do you say? 10,000 shekels, cash in hand. ﻿Can I be straight with you? ﻿You don't look like someone who wants to help. ﻿15,000 shekels. See? ﻿I just helped you to an extra 5,000 shekels. ﻿Think about it. ﻿Give me a call. ﻿Good morning. -Good morning. ﻿How goes ﻿I happened to see you and your buddies come in here last night ﻿I thought I'd check if everything's okay. ﻿Is everything okay? ﻿I felt like having a loquat, so I picked some, ﻿and I figured since I'm... ﻿Want a loquat? ﻿Take it. ﻿"Blessed are You, Lord our God, Creator of the fruit of the tree." ﻿Amen. ﻿Want some more? ﻿No, keep it... -I can't. ﻿Keep it for later. ﻿No, I'm not allowed. Take it. ﻿Why not? It's a fruit. It's kosher... ﻿Please take the pits with you. ﻿It isn't stolen, the tree belongs to everyone. ﻿I know it's none of my business, but... ﻿You wanna call somebody? ﻿Want me to call somebody for you? ﻿No, thanks. ﻿You sure? ﻿Family? ﻿The police? ﻿What the hell are you doing? ﻿What's in your head, brains or baklava? ﻿I didn't do anything! ﻿You think this is some drunken brawl at the bar? ﻿Do you know what you're getting into? ﻿This is a bad, bad story. ﻿I'm not getting into anything. ﻿I asked you to help, not get in the way. ﻿I'm sorry. Now please let me go. ﻿I need your apartment, I asked you nicely. ﻿I offered to pay you, ﻿You offered and I refused. ﻿I don't owe you anything. ﻿Wait. You're right, I'm sorry. ﻿I need your help. ﻿Okay, but tell me what's going on. ﻿I can't. ﻿I'm a private investigator, I have a client, ﻿I must keep this confidential. ﻿If the client's the problem, bring him here and let him explain. ﻿Listen here, bunny-boy, you mess with me ﻿and I'll call the cops and tell them who's defacing the walls ﻿with his childish doodles, understand? ﻿Childish doodles? ﻿Thanks a lot. ﻿Wait, I didn't... ﻿People in this city are always looking fortrouble. ﻿We should start an action committee. ﻿The CUNT - "Committee against Ultra Nationalistic Tendencies." ﻿I'm accepting donations, I'll take money or arak... ﻿Who's the hunk? ﻿Nobody... ﻿"Nobody"? With you there is no "nobody." ﻿Mr. Shmaya Knafo is still playing for time. ﻿Can't you see it's over? ﻿With all due respect for fasting and penance. ﻿You yourself taught us that true enlightenment ﻿must come through confession. You have to write it all down ﻿so that your mortal memory will not trick you in the future, ﻿you have to write your own confession. ﻿I hate myself so much that I even contemplated suicide, I swear. ﻿I'm sure I heard something. Go check out back, quick. ﻿"Shmaya Knafo" ﻿"Shmaya Knafo - Vehicle Assessor" ﻿"Shmaya Knafo - Preservation of Tunisian Jewish Heritage" ﻿"Rabbi Shmaya Knafo's Website" ﻿"Miracle-worker Rabbi Shmaya Knafo" ﻿They say that when the saint asks, God responds. ﻿That's how it is with Rabbi Knafo, his prophecies always come true. ﻿And his works of charity - incredible. ﻿For donations call... ﻿The leader of tens of thousands of followers. ﻿The people of Zion know that there is a prophet in our midst... ﻿What we need is a joint mobilization ﻿Of big hearts and big business. ﻿People went out to the streets shouting: ﻿"We want social justice!" ﻿But it isn't just the people's wish... ﻿God wants social justice! God, bless His name forever... ﻿Where's the client? ﻿The client is inside. Do you have a cell phone? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿You'll get the battery back after the meeting. ﻿You suspect everybody - Your kids must love you. ﻿What is this place? ﻿Is this where we're meeting him? -Her. ﻿Arnav, this is Ella Gorsky. Shmaya Knafo's sister-in-law. ﻿Mr. Knafo and my sister have been together ﻿since they met in a Kibbutz. ﻿After about 6 months ﻿all the Kibbutzniks started fighting over him. ﻿He had a strange ability to predict the future... ﻿What do you mean, "predict the future"? ﻿Like a weatherman? ﻿Yes, but not just the weather. ﻿In the cowshed, he knew which cows were going to get sick. ﻿Also, which tractors were going to break down... ﻿Let's get to the point, if you don't mind. ﻿People started coming to him with questions and wishes, ﻿asking for blessings. ﻿Then three wise guys realized his potential as a startup ﻿and turned him into a rabbi, though he has no credentials... ﻿They started a media campaign - ﻿a blind man who got his sight back, a cripple who got up and walked... ﻿He went from the cowshed to the penthouse. ﻿The penthouse? -The donations got bigger and bigger every year. ﻿These guys started paying themselves fat salaries, ﻿before you know it ﻿the foundation has over 60 million shekels in the bank... ﻿60 million shekels, and he's locked up in Musrara? ﻿He's a masochist? Why isn't he at a fancy Hotel? ﻿That's exactly what we're trying to find out. ﻿Something went wrong... between the three guys and Mr. Knafo. ﻿My brother-in-law disappeared a few months ago. ﻿They told my sister that her husband felt his powers were fading ﻿and he needed to re-energize... ﻿so they arranged seclusion and purification in Jerusalem. ﻿Which makes perfect sense, because if we have a problem ﻿with a man who has powers, we'll take him to a city that has powers... ﻿Anyway, a month passed, then another, and we didn't hear from him. ﻿And with all due respect for powers - he could call, right? ﻿As you can imagine, my sister got very worried ﻿and asked me to hire someone to find out what's going on, quietly. ﻿What do they want from him? -We don't know. ﻿People will go far when 60 million shekels are at stake... ﻿Mr. Knafo's life may be in danger. ﻿But if they're making so much money off him, ﻿why would they kill him? ﻿Sometimes a holy man's gravesite is worth more than the man alive... ﻿That's why we need your help. ﻿If you don't mind, I'll go to the bathroom and think it over. ﻿I suggest you go on without me. ﻿Let him show you around Jerusalem. ﻿Spend quality time together. ﻿I think you'll get more out of him than me. ﻿Jerusalem makes me nervous... ﻿Is it 100% safe here? -97%. ﻿I try to be nice and I others will be nice to me. ﻿Suicide bombers know that? ﻿(Arabic) ﻿Sorry, I got scared... ﻿97%. ﻿Here, this is the place. ﻿Well? ﻿I always thought Jerusalemites claim their hummus is the best ﻿to compensate for your many shortcomings, but I see you have a case. ﻿Thanks. I know lots of good places like this. ﻿Tell me, does your sister believe in Mr. Knafo's powers? ﻿I could give you a whole speech about that. ﻿It's not easy when your sister is married to someone who represents ﻿everything you see as scary and dangerous about this country. ﻿My sister means the world to me, ﻿and I'm here to help her save her family. ﻿Careful... -Sorry. ﻿Are you okay? -I'm fine. That's the second time you saved me... ﻿I'm just your average superhero. ﻿Thank you. For everything. ﻿Here's half. ﻿You'll get the other half when this is over. ﻿When's "over"? -When it's over. ﻿Take this, it's a bump key, it'll open any pin tumbler lock. ﻿You put it in the lock, bump it on the side ﻿until the teeth lock, and you're in. ﻿Where did you get it? -The key fairy gave it to me. ﻿Anyway, If Knafo asks you what you want, ﻿tell him you saw them beating him up, and since you're a good neighbor ﻿and in Musrara people don't call the police, ﻿you asked the landlord, who happens to be a friend, for the key, ﻿and you came in to help. Okay? ﻿Then he leaves with me and it's over. ﻿I don't think he'll leave with you. ﻿Why not? He's hungry, he's all beaten up, ﻿of course he'll come out. Wouldn't you? ﻿I'm not him. Besides, our job isn't to get him out, ﻿our job is to plant a camera. ﻿Hold on, hold on. A camera? ﻿You said you wanted to use the apartment for surveillance... ﻿You told Ms. Gorsky you're willing to help, didn't you? ﻿Yeah, but planting a camera? -You aren't planting a forest. ﻿It's just a camera, what's the big deal? ﻿You go in, look for something small, a picture or something, ﻿that you can see the whole room from, ﻿and plant the camera. -Are you serious? ﻿Do I look like a funny guy? -Shouldn't we just tell him ﻿we came to rescue him? That his sister-in-law sent us? ﻿That's the last thing we should tell him. ﻿Use your hare brain, The guy's locked in an apartment, ﻿they're beating him up and he doesn't ask for help. Why? ﻿Maybe these people are holding something over him. ﻿Something scary. If you tell him you're there to rescue him ﻿who knows what'll happen? ﻿I told you, this thing could end up in a gravesite... ﻿What are you doing? What are you doing? ﻿Inhaling self-confidence. ﻿You think whatever's illegal is fun, huh? ﻿And you think that whatever's fun is illegal, huh? ﻿Rabbi Knafo? ﻿It's Arnav, the loquat guy... ﻿Anybody home? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Sorry, but last night I got home from work ﻿and heard yells coming from here ﻿and I wanted to make sure you're okay. ﻿What do you care about me? ﻿If your neighbor's getting beat up, wouldn't you help him? ﻿So I got a key and... Let's get out of here... ﻿I can't... -Why not? Look at you, ﻿you're all black and blue, and it stinks in here. ﻿What's the problem? ﻿How do you even know me? ﻿I heard them say your name, I googled you, ﻿I saw your website, ﻿People who say you changed their lives with your powers. ﻿Personally, I don't know about divine powers... ﻿You are not a believer? ﻿You don't believe in the Creator? Lord have mercy, you need help... ﻿I think you're the one who needs help. ﻿Is that what you think? ﻿Can I ask you a few questions? ﻿Such as? -What do you do for a living? ﻿I'm... multidisciplinary. I paint a little, write a little... ﻿A little of this and a little of that. ﻿Is it enough, or is it too little? ﻿Sometimes it's enough, and sometimes, you know, ﻿I'm not sure where I'm going, but... ﻿I can tell you... ﻿And how exactly do you do that? ﻿I see it in images. ﻿I have a pipeline to Heaven so I can see the future. ﻿Ask a question. Work, relationships, you name it. ﻿I have a job. ﻿Relationship... ﻿Relationship. -Relationship. ﻿I see... your girl is at odds with herself. ﻿Be careful, it could get complicated. ﻿There's an unsolved issue with turning religious... ﻿and a secret issue... ﻿that has to do with... ﻿me? ﻿I don't know how... ﻿Do you know a girl like that? ﻿I don't know how but he had me all confused. ﻿Confusing people is his business. ﻿If you'd inhaled less self-confidence ﻿you wouldn't have been confused. ﻿By tomorrow I'll have a replica made and you can switch objects. ﻿Me? That's illegal! ﻿And painting graffiti is legal? Eh, Bugs Bunny? ﻿Listen, I'm sick of playing see-saw with you. ﻿You got your money, didn't you? Then do your job. ﻿You know what? ﻿Take the money. I don't need it. ﻿It's there, on the table. I don't want it. Take it. ﻿Don't get all sensitive on me... ﻿Leave me alone. I don't want to be involved in this. ﻿What's your problem? -Tell your client I'm sorry ﻿but this isn't for me. -Arnav! ﻿Arnav! ﻿Hey. -Thanks for coming, I... ﻿I wasn't sure you'd be willing to see me. ﻿Gittis said you have a problem and you want to return the money... ﻿Listen, he's a real paranoid... ﻿and nasty and violent and strange... ﻿It's scary to have a guy like him around. ﻿You're right. -And he carries a gun. ﻿I'm really sorry you have to go through this. ﻿But the people who recommended him said he doesn't have a life, ﻿so he's totally committed to his work. ﻿There's nothing to be afraid of, trust me. ﻿Please. ﻿I don't want to sound hysterical, but... ﻿it's a matter of life and death. ﻿I don't know what else I can do... ﻿It's not like I don't understand, ﻿But I have a bad feeling about that Gittis guy. ﻿On the other hand, ﻿maybe I automatically hate him because he used to be a cop. ﻿Well, if I buckle under now like a wimp you'll have come here ﻿for a minute and a half. ﻿It probably took you longer to find a parking space. ﻿It took half an hour to find a parking space. -Half an hour? ﻿Yeah. ﻿As I'm already here ﻿and as you were so successful with the hummus, ﻿want to keep proving Jerusalem isn't as depressing as I thought? ﻿Actually, it's hip-hop night at a new club here. ﻿I don't know if that's your thing... ﻿Should I be offended? ﻿Something to drink? ﻿A vodka chaser? -Sure. ﻿Two vodka chasers... ﻿See? Jerusalem isn't only hummus. -Cool. ﻿To the city and its powers and its superheroes. ﻿This superhero is always at your service. -Cheers. ﻿Classy company, Arnav. ﻿Can I offer you a bargain? ﻿You're working nights, Cholera? ﻿Not really, I just came to look around. ﻿But I might as well do some business. ﻿I offered to go in with the owner, but he got all snooty on me ﻿and said, "This isn't a barbershop..." ﻿Not nice. -Never mind. How about a feelgood? ﻿Want some? -I feel good already, thanks. ﻿And I have to drive back to Tel Aviv, ﻿so I don't think I'll even drink. ﻿What did you call him? Cholera? ﻿An acronym for Chaim Leria Aharonov. ﻿He's a mega-geek, but he likes to be called Cholera, ﻿it sounds tougher. ﻿They want me to paint on the wall, mind if I leave you for a minute? ﻿What? Um... ﻿Go ahead. Don't worry about me, I'll manage. ﻿Just a minute... ﻿You crazy? Just woke up... ﻿You alive? ﻿I was worried. ﻿Called you late last night but you didn't answer... ﻿I didn't hear it. I crashed. ﻿God help us - Put on some clothes. ﻿Half the day is gone... ﻿Don't you want your life to go anywhere? ﻿You must do something, you aren't 17 anymore... ﻿What a mess. ﻿You know what's good about being religious? Order. ﻿You wake up knowing exactly what you're going to do... ﻿Your Holiness, isn't it a little early for a bible class? ﻿Come on.. ﻿Nice drawing. -Thanks. ﻿What's with the aliens in the abandoned apartment? ﻿You won't believe it. ﻿We can't. -What do you mean, we can't? ﻿You know how long it takes to meet a guy like him? ﻿Six months if you have the right connections. ﻿He walks the paths of Heaven... ﻿So do Airline stewardesses... Fly on in. ﻿Maybe he can tell me how I'll find true love... ﻿Please. ﻿It could change my whole life. Do me a favor... please? ﻿What? ﻿Sorry the conditions aren't so suitable for consultations... ﻿It's fine with me. ﻿Go away... -Fine. ﻿You owe me one... ﻿I'm shaking. ﻿He told me things that made no sense, but... ﻿if he says so. ﻿So what did he say? ﻿A week from now my life is going to change. ﻿"Going to change..." ﻿Don't spoil it with your skepticism. -I'm not spoiling it. Let's go. ﻿Where are we going? -To Weinberg's. ﻿I haven't had my morning coffee yet. Come on. ﻿Where are you? ﻿-What are you doing? ﻿At my place in ten minutes? ﻿Bye. ﻿You owe me a favor, right? -What kind of favor? ﻿Take this. Go in and put it exactly where the original is. ﻿Make sure he doesn't notice. Press this back here to turn it on. ﻿Can I ask a question? -Another question? ﻿What do you expect to find out? ﻿What do they want him to write down? It could be anything. ﻿A Swiss bank account number, ﻿a juicy confession from a politician who came for a consultation... ﻿So you're saying that Knafo's involved in dirty dealings? ﻿All these "holy men" are involved in dirty dealings. ﻿Then how will this end up? ﻿I'm not the one with powers. ﻿That's why you're planting the camera, right? ﻿Are you still here? ﻿You're pretty slow for a rabbit. ﻿Go on. Meep-meep... ﻿Your holiness? ﻿I was at the store and thought you might like something sweet. ﻿So I thought... ﻿Cookies? ﻿You're going to make me fat. ﻿You could use a few pounds... ﻿I lost a lot of weight in the last few months. ﻿It's dangerous not to eat. Here, it's extra-kosher. ﻿"Blessed are You, Lord our God, Creator of all foods." ﻿Amen. ﻿Mind if I ask you a question? ﻿Of course. This time it's about money, right? ﻿Not about me... About you. ﻿When I gave you that loquat you took a long time to decide ﻿whether to eat it, and you felt guilty. ﻿But when I gave you rice and beans ﻿you dove into it like an Olympic swimmer. ﻿What happened? ﻿I realized that if God keeps sending you to me ﻿maybe He thinks I've suffered enough. ﻿How long are you going to be stuck here? ﻿Not much longer. Five days at the most. ﻿Here, take this away. -No, keep it... ﻿in case I don't come back soon. Keep it. ﻿I can't let them see it. ﻿Your apartment is just like mine. There's a boiler over the shower. ﻿Hide it up there. Nobody will know. ﻿You might need it. ﻿Tell me, Rabbi, if you really do have powers, ﻿why didn't you know you were heading into this mess? ﻿That which you can see about others you can't see about yourself. ﻿Besides, I'm only human. ﻿I'm like everyone else. ﻿I make mistakes and waste the gifts that God gave me. ﻿I get addicted to power and success, etc., etc... ﻿The only way to learn is to fall and get up again. ﻿There's a story that King David dug the foundations for the Temple ﻿right across the street from here, ﻿and suddenly subterranean oceans rose up and nearly destroyed the world. ﻿Understand? ﻿The subterranean oceans are inside us... ﻿Bravo, Hamster. Good job. ﻿Just so you know, if someone wants Knafo dead, ﻿he knows nothing about it. ﻿He thinks he'll be out of there within five days. ﻿It's not a question of faith, it's a strategy. ﻿Believe me, Knafo can read Bejerano and his pals like a book. ﻿He's playing for time. ﻿He's a master strategist. ﻿He seems much more naive than you think. ﻿You're the one who's naive, Hamster. ﻿You can't read people like he can. People like him are psychopaths. ﻿You can't read psychopaths ﻿because they believe their own lies. ﻿You really hate him, don't you? ﻿I can't believe you're trying to save someone you hate so much. ﻿I don't mix feelings with work. ﻿Well, I'm going. Don't touch anything. ﻿Especially the hard disk... ﻿Rabbi Knafo's meteoric rise ﻿Was opposed by the rabbinical establishment, ﻿bringing about a war of slander, ﻿and a welter of accusations bordering on the criminal. ﻿These are organizations that launder millions, ﻿whose main asset is the rabbi's credibility. ﻿These sects employ full-time PR people, advertising consultants ﻿and, this past year, ﻿private investigators on payroll. ﻿"Battle of the holy men" ﻿That's today's headline. ﻿Charges were pressed today against an actress, ﻿who was hired by a private investigator to seduce and frame Rabbi Sidris, ﻿known as "The Seer." 'The Seductive Actress" "The Crooked detectiv ﻿"Ella Gorsky" ﻿"No results found for Ella Gorsky" ﻿"Ella Gorsky" ﻿Hi. ﻿You aren't surprised to see me. ﻿Semi-surprised. -Why semi-surprised? ﻿You text me such a paranoid message, ﻿knowing I'll drop everything and come. ﻿Me, paranoid? Ella Gorsky. ﻿Where did you come up with that name, ﻿some Chekhov play in acting school? ﻿What school? -There is no Ella Gorsky. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I mean that Gittis, that psycho-criminal liar, really works ﻿for some other holy man who's fighting Shmaya Knafo. ﻿So to make the story more believable ﻿Mr. Gittis hired a pretty actress, and you really are pretty, ﻿to throw me off, and I bought the story ﻿f that you're poor Knafo's sister-in-law. ﻿It's all over, lady. ﻿Why are you silent? ﻿Because I don't know which stupidity to address first. ﻿Grttis works for a competing rabbi, I'm a hired actress... ﻿I have a real job with real customers ﻿who don't want to see a real messy bar, so... ﻿So you're saying there's nothing I can say to reassure you, right? ﻿Find someone to sub for you and we'll take a trip. ﻿What kind of trip? -An educational trip. ﻿Tell someone you're going somewhere with me ﻿they should call the police if you're not back. ﻿I'm not that scary, am I? ﻿I get it. Your job is to keep me away from the 'hood ﻿so your baboons can do their job in peace. ﻿If you mean the three men from the apartment, ﻿they're not coming tonight. They don't work on the Sabbath. ﻿I forgot, they're God fearing individuals. ﻿They beat the hell out of people on weekdays, but not on Sabbath. ﻿Why don't you tell me where we're going? It's near dark... ﻿Are you afraid of the dark? ﻿Aunt Ella... -How are you, sweetie? ﻿What a surprise! Why didn't you say you were coming? ﻿We were in the area so we thought we'd stop by. ﻿This is my wonderful sister Billie. Excuse me, Mrs. Knafo. Bilhah. ﻿Nice to meet you. Arnav... Ariel Navon. ﻿Nice to meet you, Ariel. ﻿He's helping me with our "problem". ﻿Why don't you have a seat? ﻿Mordechai, get two chairs from upstairs... ﻿Wait, take this too... Thank you, sweetie. ﻿That's Mordechai, the eldest. Next week is the Bar Mitzvah. ﻿Mazel tov. I hope you're hungry. ﻿I'm always hungry. -Sit down. ﻿Make yourself at home. -Hello, everyone. ﻿I'm such an idiot. -And that story you invented? ﻿A Chekhov play? -Go ahead, make fun of me... ﻿-Just one question: Why couldn't I find ﻿an Ella Gorsky anywhere? ﻿Until almost a year ago I was Ella Gur. ﻿You were? ﻿Are you... married? ﻿No, I took back our old country last name, Gorsky. ﻿Funny, Billie also changed her name. ﻿Sometimes I forget she's called Bilhah now. ﻿Isn't she amazing? ﻿Can I get you a drink? ﻿How about a Jaeger? ﻿Sorry, it's all I have. ﻿I'm sorry... ﻿It's just so crazy to see him like that... ﻿I know. We'll save him... ﻿Poor Billie, my God... ﻿You're so sweet for saying "we'll save." ﻿And you're sweet for helping me with all this. ﻿So thank you. ﻿It's not that I don't want to, it's just... ﻿It's complicated, he's there and we're here. ﻿I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come in. I'll leave. Good night. ﻿You can't leave in the middle of the night. ﻿It's not safe to drive to Tel Aviv at this hour. ﻿Stay here. ﻿And not so I can... ﻿I'll sleep in the living room, you can have the bedroom, ﻿he said chivalrously... ﻿You really are sweet. ﻿And I really am tired. ﻿It's been a long day. -I know. ﻿I'll change the sheets, which is a rare occurrence. ﻿Not sure I remember how - Sheets go over the mattress, right? ﻿Sorry... ﻿I just went into the bedroom to make sure you're okay, not to... ﻿But you looked so beautiful in the morning light, so... ﻿That's the mask I wear when I paint in the street at night. ﻿Jerusalem is full of security cameras, so... ﻿And I'm not very photogenic... ﻿Mr. Psycho... ﻿Good morning. If you don't mind, I1 ﻿not alone. ﻿Fine. Go in your bedroom and do your thing, ﻿I won't disturb you. -Come back in half an hour... ﻿it's quiet over there. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿The double-agent is coming right back. What do we do? ﻿It's crucial he doesn't find out we're onto him. ﻿Just act natural, okay? -But if I... ﻿Let me find out What's his story. ﻿No one came to visit him last night, I checked. ﻿Relax, man. ﻿I'll decide when to relax and when not to. ﻿By the way, I suggest you find a friend to stay with ﻿until Wednesday at least. ﻿What do you mean? Are you moving in? ﻿It's Saturday morning. Don't you have a wife and kids? ﻿None of your business. ﻿He's playing with fire and they'll burn him. ﻿I have to be here 24/7. ﻿You can't move in. It's not a hotel. ﻿You know what?

Sorry. ﻿bet he won't answer. ﻿That's a lethal weapon he has there. ﻿You think he's working for you, but I'm onto him. ﻿He's the type who takes everyone for a ride. ﻿He'll copy the original and sell it to both sides. ﻿My sister will never forgive me for this. ﻿She trusted me and I... ﻿Why didn't I see this coming? ﻿Why didn't I realize you were right about him? ﻿I'm such an idiot, God... ﻿Listen, Gittis' mind is diseased but... ﻿Hello, Mr. Aharonov. Is Choi... Chaim out back? ﻿Yeah, yeah. -Come on. ﻿What did I ask for? -You wanted it short in back. ﻿I said I want it like Alain Delon. ﻿This guy stole from me a laptop and a hard disk ﻿and I'm looking for someone to retrieve it. ﻿What do you mean, "retrieve"? ﻿I mean get into the thief's apartment. ﻿and... you know... ﻿What do you mean, "get in" ﻿A burglar. ﻿I'll pay good money. ﻿How much is good money? ﻿5,000 ﻿7,000? ﻿10,000? ﻿All right. ﻿It's urgent, so if you know anyone with experience who can... ﻿Who? ﻿Oh... ﻿I didn't know you had such a broad education... ﻿How do you know where he lives? ﻿He met the Hassid here in the park ﻿and they went to the building across. ﻿My friend Vax followed them. ﻿Arnav. ﻿What's up? ﻿3rd floor, apartment 9. There's no sign on the door. ﻿Does she have the money on her? ﻿With all due respect to your... broad education, ﻿first let's see you get in. ﻿Okay, let's go. ﻿"Let's go"? Why do I have to go? ﻿You want me to get the wrong hard disk? ﻿The wrong laptop? All right, then. ﻿What's that? You stole it from the school janitor? ﻿I have every possible kind of master key here. ﻿Everyone has a master key these days. ﻿Where was I when they gave them out? -Calm down ﻿Why the light? ﻿You expect me to sniff it out? ﻿Didn't you bring a flashlight? -No, I left it with the stocking. ﻿Then why are we whispering? -Tradition, okay? ﻿Well, lookie here... ﻿And who hit the jackpot? ﻿Sorry I can't watch it with you. I'm late for work. ﻿Thank God you got it back from Gittis. ﻿owe you so much. -Not at all. ﻿I want Knafo to go home to your sister... ﻿You're really, really sweet and... -Really late. Gotta run. Bye. ﻿Wait a second. ﻿Vodka on the rocks, whisky on the rocks, ﻿and three draft beers. -At your service, Saint Vax. ﻿One day you're ecstatic, the next day you're miserable. ﻿Are you 9etting your period? ﻿As a sworn feminist I intend to ignore that chauvinist comment ﻿and I'm letting you know that I'm going to be happy ﻿at least until the Messiah comes. -Amen. ﻿Don't spill beer, Arnav. ﻿Well, Cavilio? Do you have a new action committee? ﻿Well, I was reading in today's paper that larceny is socialy acceptable. ﻿And I thought, it's time to start a new action committee. ﻿And it'll be called...? ﻿CLAP. ﻿Clever Larcenists with Permits. ﻿Where is it? -Where's what? ﻿Don't play games with me. ﻿You think you're so smart, well, you aren't. ﻿I'll ask you again and I suggest you answer me. ﻿Where is it? ﻿If I don't tell you, what'll you do? Shoot me? ﻿Listen here, pet-shop boy. I'm not the bad guy. ﻿I suggest you open your eyes, they're using you like a used diaper. ﻿Who is? -You know who. You know nothing about that girl. ﻿You don't know what her plans are, what she has in mind. ﻿I don't believe you. -Oh yeah? ﻿Go to Knafo's website, videos from March 2009, ﻿and when you see what you see, you'll feel like an idiot ﻿and you'll be calling me. ﻿Asshole. ﻿Yes. -Good morning. Where are you? ﻿I'm... ﻿Running errands. In Jerusalem, near the mall. ﻿Where are you, in Tel Aviv? ﻿Yes. I just sent the check, you should get it in a few days. ﻿Thanks, but checks are usually sent when the job is done. ﻿It is done, ﻿You did a fine job, I have no complaints, ﻿that's why I'm sending you the entire amount now. ﻿I don't need your services anymore. ﻿Mrs. Knafo. ﻿It's the investigator your sister sent. Open up. ﻿Mrs. Knafo... ﻿I want to tell you something you don't know about your sister. ﻿About Ella. ﻿Hello, Ms. Gorsky. ﻿Aren't you in Jerusalem? ﻿Aren't you in Tel Aviv? ﻿Fine, we're both liars. ﻿What do you want? ﻿I want to talk to your sister. -She's not here. ﻿Besides, I made myself clear, your job is done. ﻿I still want to talk to your sister ﻿and tell her that her husband is still in grave danger. ﻿Mrs. Knafo... ﻿Mrs. Knafo... ﻿I had a feeling you won't walk away, ﻿so I brought security officers... ﻿Go away... ﻿Mrs. Knafo... ﻿I told you she's not here. ﻿Where is it? ﻿What are you going to do, beat me up? ﻿I've been through worse, I'm not scared of you. ﻿What are you going to do? -None of your business. ﻿You saved me with those cookies, you know. ﻿I owe you so much. -Wait, Rabbi Knafo. ﻿Shmaya. There's no more "Rabbi ﻿Shmaya. There's something on my mind... ﻿something I have to tell you. ﻿You say I saved you, but... ﻿I also got you into trouble. ﻿Trouble? ﻿How? Why would you get me into trouble? ﻿Accidentally, stupidly, unintentionally. ﻿Problem is, because of me you have a big problem now. ﻿You saw what you saw ﻿You heard what you heard ﻿The Torah says: Be righteous as God commands. ﻿That's you. ﻿You don't need a suit and a beard to be a righteous man. ﻿You're righteous as you are. ﻿Hold on, bear with me... This is hard enough as it is... ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿Does the name Ella Gur mean anything to you? ﻿She's my wife's sister. How do you know her? ﻿Well... Ella Gur and some investigator who's working with her, ﻿or against her... I'm not sure anymore... ﻿Anyway, they hired me to help them save you. ﻿Ella Gur wants to save me? -That's what she said. ﻿Anyway, it turned out that... ﻿I planted a camera in here... ﻿to make sure you're okay... ﻿find out what these gorillas wanted from you. ﻿Camera? What camera? ﻿Are you saying that everything was taped? ﻿Where is it now? ﻿Does she have it? ﻿I'm so sorry. ﻿Tell me the truth. ﻿All the food and the cookies and the things we said, ﻿was just to trick me? -I swear I was trying to help you. ﻿I kept saying "let's get out of here" ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Can you get it from her? ﻿Since she got it she's been screening me, ﻿but I'll go see her, I'll talk to her. ﻿Do you know where she lives? ﻿How would I know where she lives? ﻿Maybe that investigator knows. It's a matter of life and death. ﻿You crazy? You told him? Why? ﻿This situation is volatile. ﻿Any little thing could set off a chain reaction. ﻿You really that stupid or just pretending? ﻿You manipulated me, she manipulated me... ﻿How did I manipulate you? ﻿Who tricked me into planting the camera? ﻿And then stole the hard disk and the laptop with all the evidence. ﻿I didn't steal the laptop, I took it. ﻿I took it for one reason, to protect Knafo. ﻿She hired me to protect and that's what I'm doing. ﻿Protecting him. From her. -From her? ﻿She's his sister-in-law, why would she want to hurt him? ﻿You don't have a clue, do you? You know what your problem is? ﻿You're playing a game where you don't even know the rules. ﻿You're a Taki card at a poker table. ﻿And the girl you're up against is a poker champion ﻿and you just handed her a full house. ﻿I don't believe a word of it. You were going to sell it ﻿to some Rabbi from a competing sect. ﻿A competing sect? That's powerful weed you're smoking. ﻿Don't give me that. You were in Independence Park ﻿the other day with a Hassid. ﻿What Hassid? ﻿You mean my son? ﻿Your son? ﻿He's a Hassid? ﻿I have two Hassid sons, yes. ﻿Is that what you thought, that I can be bought? ﻿You don't know me - it's time you learn to pick the right side. ﻿Let's go to your place. I hope he hasn't taken the camera apart. ﻿Wait, just tell me where she lives. ﻿Let's first make sure he's okay. ﻿So... ﻿Whoa, careful, it's an elderly computer. ﻿Give it time to connect. ﻿Please tell me where she lives. ﻿Let's make sure it connects first. Why can't you tell me? ﻿Let's make sure it connects first. ﻿It's not elderly, it's geriatric. Nothing's happening. ﻿While, we're waiting, can I ask a question? ﻿At your apartment I saw a photograph of you ﻿with your wife and two non-religious kids, ﻿and you said you have a Hassidic son, and... ﻿Forget it... ﻿Sorry. ﻿Me and my wife... ﻿were a happy couple. ﻿Two wonderful children. ﻿A loving home. Everything was perfect. ﻿As far as I knew. ﻿I guess my wife thought otherwise. ﻿I was so busy with police work... ﻿I didn't notice she was drifting away, ﻿searching for something. Something different. ﻿Then he showed up. -Who showed up? ﻿The Redeemer. That's what he calls himself. ﻿A holy man like Knafo. Started to brainwash her. ﻿Told her what to wear, how to act, what to think. ﻿Suddenly, she changed... ﻿one fine day she just walked out of my life. ﻿What's worse is that the Redeemer took away my kids... ﻿He convinced their mother they shouldn't see their father. ﻿That their father is a sinner. ﻿My own flesh and blood, detest me... ﻿But you do see...? -My eldest. ﻿Once a week, secretly. You call that seeing him? ﻿And the other son? ﻿He won't give me the time of day. ﻿As far as he's concerned, he has no father ﻿He didn't touch the camera? Interesting. ﻿How are you getting to Tel Aviv? -By bus, I guess. ﻿No, don't go by bus. ﻿Here. Got a driver's license? ﻿Take my car. I'm parked outside. ﻿Why did you do this to me? ﻿What do you want? -To stop feeling like an idiot. ﻿Forget it, you'll never understand. ﻿Why did you lie to me? Why? ﻿I assume there's someone who sees me now. ﻿And I believe that Arnav is an honest man ﻿who keeps his promises, so he must be in Tel Aviv ﻿talking with the lady. ﻿I have a big favor to ask. Please get a message to Arnav: ﻿If things get complicated, ﻿tell him to ask her about the Tomb of Amos. ﻿It's very important. The Tomb of Amos the Prophet. ﻿So I came back from the U.S. in good shape financially ﻿but not emotionally. ﻿I was married there for almost two years. ﻿Things were really bad. ﻿Bad choices are my greatest talent. ﻿Anyway, when I got back ﻿I looked for something deeper, with meaning... ﻿My sister's little one* was just born then ﻿so I decided to stay with her for a week and help her... ﻿And then... ﻿I got hooked... ﻿It's so banal, I'm embarrassed to talk about it. ﻿If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone. ﻿It's a cult. ﻿And Mr. Knafo is a cult leader. ﻿He says you must break free of all the bonds that hold you. ﻿He says that the ego is evil ﻿and only he can save you. ﻿And then, like a moron, ﻿you destroy your ego to the point where you even change your name. ﻿You give up everything for someone who turns out to be a con man. ﻿You realize how humiliating that is? ﻿He's a crook, that's what he is. ﻿My sister's married to a crook I had to save her ﻿but had I told her, she'd never believe me. ﻿So when they jailed him it was the perfect chance ﻿to get it on tape, you know, ﻿to get evidence, to expose him, to upload it onto the internet, ﻿so that the whole world, especially my sister, will know. ﻿Why the Tomb of Amos? ﻿So you're the one she hired? ﻿Is "the Tomb of Amos" a codeword? ﻿Just say "the Tomb of Amos." ﻿Please. ﻿That's all. ﻿I can't help you if you won't tell me What's "the Tomb of Amos". ﻿Just send the message. I don't need your help. ﻿"God is my helper and protector." ﻿God helps and protects people who deserve it, ﻿not con artists who pose as rabbis and steal money from the poor. ﻿Are you calling me a con artist and a thief? ﻿I made a lot of mistakes, ﻿but to take money we collected for the poor? ﻿Never! ﻿Why do you think I'm locked up? ﻿Why do you think they want me to write things that make me look shameful? ﻿So they can blackmail me... ﻿because they stole money and I wanted to stop it. ﻿Now please send the message, no more questions. ﻿Not just for my sake, for yours too. It'll change your life. ﻿Do I look like someone who'd fall for your baloney? ﻿You look like someone who needs help as much as I do. ﻿You too are locked up in the dark with your grief. ﻿This is an opportunity for change. ﻿So please give him the message. ﻿I'm telling you, I believe he realizes his mistakes ﻿and he honestly intends... ﻿You've known him for a week. I know him on a whole other level. ﻿Just forget it, okay? ﻿Goodbye. ﻿"Ask her about the Tomb of Amos" ﻿Wait a second. ﻿When you said you know him on a whole other level, ﻿did you mean... ﻿the Tomb of Amos? ﻿He told you about that? ﻿Is that what he thinks? ﻿That I'm some brokenhearted teenager trying to get revenge? ﻿So he's trying to cover up his crimes ﻿by making me out equally immoral? ﻿We were all there for a nighttime prayer ritual ﻿at the Tomb of Amos. ﻿Amos was the bible's most anti-establishment prophet. ﻿We were all in a state of ecstasy, praying and singing and dancing, ﻿and I got lost in the rhythm and I... ﻿I gave it all I had. ﻿And then, before dawn... ﻿everyone had gone to sleep and I... ﻿suddenly saw him standing alone by the tomb ﻿and I wanted to tell him what an amazing experience it was, ﻿that I'd never forget it... ﻿And then... ﻿he turned to me and told me ﻿to wait until he was done praying... ﻿then I realized he was reciting the prayer you say ﻿before what they call... ﻿intimacy... ﻿I could've walked away, but... ﻿I didn't. ﻿You see what power that miserable creep had over me? ﻿I betrayed my own sister. ﻿Listen, it's understandable, you want revenge ﻿But if you take it... ﻿then what happened between the two of you will come out. ﻿You realize what will happen to your sister's life? ﻿To your life? Is it worth it? ﻿What's happening? ﻿What's happening with you? ﻿She said she won't do anything with the disk until tomorrow. ﻿She might even talk to him. ﻿You never learn, do you, weasel? She never will. ﻿Why do you say that? She's a smart girl. ﻿Wait a second... ﻿He has guests. -What's going on? ﻿And there's... ﻿a woman... ﻿Rabbi Knafo? ﻿Where are you? ﻿We have a surprise that'll make you very happy. ﻿Shmaya... ﻿How I missed you... ﻿"Bless you,O Lord, Who has brought us to this occasion." ﻿Rabbi, the fasting and penance you imposed on yourself ﻿proved themselves. ﻿Now your powers are... ﻿Wonder of wonders. ﻿Shmaya, you're so thin... ﻿I brought you food. ﻿There's nothing like home cooking. ﻿And tomorrow well drive to the desert, ﻿well pray, and next day we'll have a big celebration. ﻿Well all celebrate your son's Bar Mitzvah. ﻿That's weird... -What's going on? ﻿They're all friendly, planning the Bar Mitzvah. ﻿But its... Off... ﻿Why do you think it's "Off" ﻿I just saw them leave the apartment. ﻿That means everything's okay, end of story, he won. ﻿If they brought his wife and food, ﻿that means all the penance and fasting is over, ﻿he probably knew they had to release him before the Bar Mitzvah, ﻿because if he didn't show, people will be asking questions. ﻿Something here doesn't make sense. ﻿What? ﻿Bejerano isn't the type to give up so easily. ﻿He humiliated him, starved him, ﻿to get him to confess in writing. ﻿but it didn't happen. ﻿And as it didn't, it's not over for Bejerano. ﻿All this talk about the Bar Mitzvah... ﻿Sounds like a ruse - they're up to something... ﻿Why do you think so? ﻿With all due respect to your poker skills, ﻿how can you read them? ﻿Mr. Detective, I'm sure you can hear me, ﻿so please have Arnav come here and tell me what the lady said. ﻿Well? What did she say? ﻿She's coming tomorrow to talk to you. ﻿She promised. ﻿As soon as I mentioned the Tomb of Amos, ﻿which is a problem ﻿you must work out - she's very hurt. ﻿I know - it's my fault. ﻿I must fix it and I will. Whatever it takes. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I ate so much, but now I want a cookie. ﻿A cookie? ﻿Can you get it down from the boiler? ﻿It hurts to stretch... -No problem, gladly. ﻿What? ﻿Your scary detective was here. -What did he want? ﻿I don't know. That's exactly the problem. ﻿I can't read him clearly. ﻿He says one thing, but then I see... ﻿so much hatred and anger in him. ﻿I see him close to me... ﻿and my life is in danger... -What kind of danger? ﻿I'm afraid he'll do something violent... ﻿Please, just keep him away from me tomorrow. ﻿How? ﻿I'm counting on you. ﻿Arnav... Arnav... ﻿Wash your face, I need you wide awake. ﻿This is a GPS. I want you to plant it on Knafo ﻿without him noticing. ﻿Do what? ﻿Good morning. Room service. -Arnav ﻿Drink up, start your last day in here properly. ﻿You're the best. ﻿When is she coming? -She said, this afternoon. ﻿Sugar? ﻿"Blessed are You, Lord, Who created everything with His word." ﻿Amen. ﻿Very good, squirrel. ﻿I won't do anything until you'll tell me the truth. ﻿But I can't... ﻿it'll just make you feel bad and ruin your belief in religion. ﻿Since when are you so supportive of my "belief in religion"? ﻿Tell me or you'll have to manage without me. ﻿Okay... I'll tell you. ﻿What is it? ﻿This happened yesterday when Gittis entered ﻿to ask him about the Tomb of Amos. ﻿What does Gittis know? ﻿Knafo didn't tell him. Look... ﻿Are you calling me a con artist and a thief? ﻿I made a lot of mistakes, ﻿but to take money we collected for the poor? Never! ﻿See? ﻿Why do you think I'm here? ﻿Why do you think they want me to write things that make me look shameful?? ﻿So they can blackmail me... ﻿because they stole money and I wanted to stop it. ﻿But it's over. No more blindness, no more nonsense. ﻿Now please send the message. No more questions. ﻿What do you say? ﻿That I don't know if I can meet him face to face... ﻿Where is he? -Who? ﻿Knafo? This is "live"... ﻿Blessed are you, Lord, who sustained us... ﻿Amen.. ﻿Give him a hand... ﻿Such a waste of time.. ﻿I really am a pushover if I agreed to follow them... ﻿Stop it - if anything happens... ﻿It'll be on your conscience. ﻿What can happen in broad daylight? ﻿You have a great imagination, but... ﻿Let the superhero do his thing... ﻿If nothing happens, I'll take the bus home. ﻿Why so slow? Strange... ﻿Boy, you're slow to catch on. ﻿I rode half way across town. ﻿This is yours, isn't it? ﻿Are you making eyes at me? You have pretty eyes... ﻿Nitwit... ﻿Where are they taking him? Where are we? ﻿Tekoa? What's in Tekoa? ﻿The Tomb of Amos. ﻿Let's get going. ﻿Rabbi, your journey is nearly over. ﻿Soon you'll be home, ﻿God willing. ﻿Let's let them get further ahead, then we'll move on. ﻿Let's go. ﻿This could take hours. ﻿You don't have to stay. ﻿What do you think will happen? ﻿They'll pray and go home. ﻿Esteemed Rabbi... ﻿Cheers. ﻿"Blessed are You, 0 Lord, Who created everything with His word." ﻿Amen. ﻿Strong stuff... ﻿I haven't drunk alcohol in a while, and on an empty stomach... ﻿Drink up, there's plenty. ﻿Cheers. -Cheers. ﻿Gentlemen, by the leave of God and the congregation ﻿we may pray with repentant sinners. ﻿They're going to wait till the sun sets ﻿then it'll really be cold. ﻿No need... ﻿But thanks anyway. ﻿That's what we did, ﻿but with more people, drumming, dancing... ﻿God, I was such an idiot. ﻿The car's over there. -Let's take a little walk. ﻿No, I'm tired. Let's go to the car. ﻿This won't take long. ﻿Where are they going? That's the wrong way. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿What we should've done a long time ago. ﻿I'll do whatever you say... -It's too late. ﻿I'm begging you! I'll write whatever you want! ﻿"Though I walk in the valley of death ﻿"I will not fear, for You are with me!" ﻿Please don't do this. ﻿Take your hand out of there, ﻿or my 9 mm will take it out for you. ﻿Good evening, friends. ﻿It's like the Wild West out here, isn't it? ﻿Open spaces, open skies... ﻿Question is, how will it end? ﻿I realize you had a tidy little plan. ﻿You go and pray at the Tomb of Amos, ﻿Rabbi Knafo tragically slips off a cliff ﻿and to your genuine grief and horror... he dies. ﻿Well, as you can see, tidy it's not going to be... ﻿Question is, what to do now? ﻿It can get messy ﻿or you can all get in your cars like good little boys ﻿and drive home... ﻿What do you say? ﻿Bejerano, we can't... ﻿It's over. ﻿In my car? ﻿Have you no shame? ﻿I want to be relaxed when I get there. ﻿It's gonna be a little tense, don't you think? ﻿I'd offer you a toke out of politeness... ﻿Out of politeness I won't put it out in your ear. ﻿I'm still mad at you for that monkey-business with the GPS. ﻿I owe you an apology. ﻿It takes time for a Taki card to learn how to play poker... ﻿Friends? ﻿How old are you? ﻿Here's your girlfriend, ﻿it looks like she lost religion... ﻿She made me tell her the truth about Knafo, ﻿it devastated her... ﻿Sorry I'm late. I still don't get why ﻿it was so important that I come to that lecherous liar's party. ﻿He thought it was important. ﻿He specifically said, "Bring your girlfriend." ﻿I must really be stupid if I agreed to come with you. ﻿If it makes you feel any better, I didn't want to come either, ﻿but Knafo insisted. ﻿Chill, people, he's having a party, he wants to set things straight ﻿so he invited people who saw him in a bad light. ﻿He wants to redeem himself. -Redeem himself? ﻿You turning into Rabbi Rabbit on me? ﻿I hope there's alcohol at least. Lots. ﻿Why aren't you driving? ﻿Mazel tov! Remember me? I'm... -Ariel, Ella's friend. ﻿That's right. Mazel tov. -Thank you. Thanks for coming. ﻿This is the happiest day of my life. Mordechai, remember Ariel? -Yes. ﻿How's it going? Mazel tov! ﻿Mazel tov. -Thank you. ﻿Let's find the alcohol. ﻿Mr. Jacob Gittis. Relax, it's a party. ﻿Can I get you a drink? Shandy? Baklava? ﻿Plant a camera in the baklava? ﻿Isn't it tiring to be cheerful all the time? ﻿Whiskey, please. ﻿Can I kiss my sister in this house? -Ella... ﻿Mazel tov, beautiful. -Thank you. ﻿Thank you, Ella. -Rabbi Knafo! ﻿Rabbi Knafo! ﻿No, no... No need... ﻿Hey. ﻿I was just about to congratulate him, ﻿tell him how much fun this is, and... ﻿I figured you'd eventually have to say hello, too, ﻿so maybe it'll be easier for you if we go together. -I'm okay. ﻿You go ahead. ﻿Thank you, thank you. I owe you my life. ﻿You owe me cookies. ﻿Come dance. ﻿Come dance. -No, no. ﻿Let's have fun. It's a happy day. ﻿Chivas please ﻿What a drag. ﻿Such a waste of time.. ﻿Thanks. ﻿But unlike you, I have nothing better to do this evening. ﻿Truthfully, neither do I. So we agree: we're both pathetic. ﻿Shmaya... ﻿Look. What are they doing here? ﻿Why shouldn't they be here? ﻿And who's he? Their new startup? ﻿They have some nerve to bring him to your son's Bar Mitzvah. ﻿They won't be using me anymore. ﻿So they found a new stooge... ﻿That's exactly how they started with me. May God protect him. ﻿Look at them. ﻿It's so sad people really believe ﻿other individuals have powers that they don't have. ﻿Powers, my ass. ﻿Not that I'm less dumber than them. ﻿The most pathetic thing is that I stood at that stinky apartment ﻿and told him such intimate things ﻿and I bought the Bazooka fortune reading he sold me. ﻿What did he tell you? -A load of bull. ﻿That my life is going to change by the end of the week. ﻿That I'm going to find the love of my life. ﻿By the end of the week? That doesn't leave you much time. ﻿We agreed that you and I are both pathetic ﻿And he even described my man in detail. ﻿Listen to this bull: He's older than me. ﻿He once wore a uniform, a pilot, a fireman, maybe a cop. ﻿Someone who'll watch over me. ﻿Absurd, huh? ﻿Me, with an ex-cop?
