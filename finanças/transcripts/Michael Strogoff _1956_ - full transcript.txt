In short, you know nothing! Feofar Khan, the emir of Bukhara rebelled against my authority, Raises an army on my own territory, Invaded and devastated the eastern Siberia. Threatening the city of Irkutsk, where my brother finds himself locked. And you know nothing! Site, everything was so fast. And the secret is so well kept. Really! Here's a nice excuse in the mouth of the police of the supreme leader of an empire, General Kriloff! Congratulations! And above the market. Feofar Khan destroyed the only telegraph line linking Moscow to Irkutsk. More possible communication between me and my brother. This also you left to do, like the rest. Everything else! I want the line to be restored within forty- eight hours. You hear, General Vassilieff. I demand! The destruction of the line was made in full territory raised, sire. Garrisons and Bastøy Noyak. Tried several times to go out to reconquer the ground. But they had to retreat before the overwhelming numerical superiority. Tartar. Feofar Khan has not been surprised once. This savage has learned to make war. Oh, yes, sire. It is not a revolt like the others. About this, precisely, Sire, we understand. So you will finally something, General Kriloff? This surprises me. The latest reports that have reached us before the destruction of the telegraph line. Indicate that a former senior officer of your majesty had set to service Feofar Khan and his Tartars. It is the former Colonel Ogareff. Ogareff? It is a name that tells me something. Colonel Ogareff was a specialist of Siberian questions, sire. He was caught in the offense of cheating at cards. Your Majesty had driven him from his rank, three years ago. Ah, I remember now. Steal so do not enough for him, he also had to betray! Ogareff this was a brilliant officer, is not it? Oh, yes, sire. I had under my orders assigned to police. He is a man without scruples. It has an immoderate ambition. But with remarkable intelligence on weapons of plan. Its presence with Feofar Khan. Gives the revolt of the Tartar a particularly dangerous significance. It takes, you understand me, gentlemen, It is necessary that my brother the Grand Duke be warned of this new danger in the shortest possible time. It is neither a board a wish, It's an order. Well, gentlemen, I wait! Sire, there is only one way to prevent His Highness the Grand Duke to Irkutsk, One, send a mail. Your majesty pardon me but it would send one of your officers to certain death. The company seems disproportionate. For getting to Irkutsk there are almost 7 thousand miles to cross. And at least half of which is under the absolute control. The raised regions. Or he would have to find a man. Gentlemen, russia has ninety million subjects. I hope you will find a man. I think I have found, sire. Perfect! I want to see my office in less than an hour. There will be in a few minutes, sir. Sire, I have read carefully the record of this officer. Which thought the general Kriloff to accomplish this particularly dangerous mission. Well, sir. I do not discuss the qualities of courage and dedication of this man nor his address. It is further of Siberian origin. And admirably in the country. This is the main. I, however, draws the attention of your majesty. The notoriously undisciplined and rebellious spirit. Which this officer gave unfortunately. Too many proofs. Really. Yes, sire. He has five or six games under his belt. Well I mean, of its liabilities. And his name was involved in several scandals certain order. Perfectly unfortunate marital order. He is married? Uh no, sire. But others were. This is why it is also still a mere captain. Despite his service. Cease to do you the slightest concern about this, General vasilieff. If this letter arrives in the hands of my brother. Your mere captain will be made colonel in the twenty-four hours. On the other hand. It is you who again become mere captain. The orders of your majesty. Come! This is the man, sir. Your name? Captain Michel strogoff. The service of the imperial mails. The orders of your majesty. Approach. You know why I made you come? I do not know sir. In your opinion, how likely the best of my letters to he cross the line Tartar. And reach Irkutsk. Without leaving his skin? No, sir. Unless he knows the Siberian inside out. What is your case, I think. Yes, sire. One chance, it's not much in such an adventure. But just told you all despise danger. It's a mistake, sir. Then this is not just. You have a chance to succeed. But twice. Three. What is the third? I'm afraid when needed. Michel strogoff, Here is a letter that you will give to Irkutsk. In the hands of my brother. The orders of your majesty. You will leave as soon as possible. General Kriloff had to put the points the details of your mission. Very carefully, sir. Very good. That's all. Strogoff Captain! Thank you. You are right, General Vassilieff. Strogoff the captain will never make a very good soldier. But what a soldier. Not bad. Not bad at all, strogoff Captain! You make a very acceptable merchant. Useless to recommend you not to keep the military look. Sit down, sir Korpanoff. You will go by the first train to nijni Novgorod. Under the identity of Nicolas Korpanoff trader tissue. It is quite normal, northern Siberia is an important wool center. I know, General. Here are your papers. Nicolas Dimitrievitch Korpanoff Thirty-eight years, Born in praffka, Residing at 16, rue mayska to Irkutsk. Married, no children. Put yourself carefully all these details in the head. It's done, sir. Now here's an official pass. Which will make available if required. Civil and military authorities of the empire. Do not use it, of course, at the last extremity. And as soon as you arrive in the Tartar region. Détruisez- the. If we found it on you, you would be lost. Yes, I know you know. But I tell you anyway. Well, general. I did not need to tell you the dangers posed a mission of this kind. You know as well as me. It y is one on which I draw your attention and you probably know. Have you heard of Ogareff ivan? Former colonel Ogareff? Yes, General. But I 've never seen. It will be your worst enemy. He is a traitor who now serves the cause of the Tartar. He's smart, beware. If he ever sees your updated disguise, I would not give a kopek of your skin. We are all mortal, General. Mr. Ogareff too, I guess. Anyway, this does not concern you, strogoff captain. You are responsible for bringing a letter to Irkutsk. That's all. Well, general. Noted. Stay! I will now present your wife. My wife? Yes I do. Have you forgotten that you are married, sir Korpanoff? My general. So it is quite normal that you are traveling with your wife. You can not be serious, think. It's already done, mind you. A woman? Mail a special mission Tsar dragging a woman behind him? It's impossible. Precisely. And I hope for your health than the former Colonel Ogareff resonate if any. Strogoff as naively as captain. You begin to understand? Admit. But it is no less true that women are generally unable to keep secrets. Especially those of others. If this one betrays me? I do not believe. Anyway, she could relate to the account of strogoff Captain Nicolas Korpanoff what would have been stupid to tell him. No other objection? Lot, General. But for the case that you, do. Do enter the person waiting in the office of commander radovski! She is pretty, at least? Issue unrelated to the purpose of your trip, Mr. Korpanoff. That said, it is pretty. Thank you, General. You are very nadia Fedoroff, Daughter of Professor Fedoroff stanislav Alekseevich. Currently in exile in Irkutsk for conspiring against the empire. No, I am the daughter of Professor Fedoroff stanislav Alekseevich. Unjustly accused by police of conspiring against the empire. Sit down, I have to talk to you. At your ease. If you need to tell me that my father died in prison, hurry I usually bad news. I you will speak when I interrogate. I mean when I talk, General Kriloff! It is not bad news. And in any case your father is not in prison irkutsk. Is under house arrest as you are you in Moscow. I do not see very well the difference. Continue. For months you query request addresses me so that I authorize you to join your father at Irkutsk. I asked that my right. Well, I grant you. You can go to Irkutsk, you are free. Free? I can go find him? It's true? Mmhmm. A condition. Forgiveness for being so naive, General Kriloff. I should have known that he could not act as a blackmail. What little infamy are you asking me in return? Whom I have sold you? I have never needed brat like yourself to lead the empire's police, Nadia Fedoroff! Here are my condition. You go to Irkutsk with Mr. Nicolas Korpanoff here now. That's all. That's really all? Almost. You will travel both as husband and wife. Your new papers are ready. This time it 's all. It's too much, I refuse. Me too. You shut up! Listen to me, Nadia Fedoroff. Or you again see your father in the conditions I just told you, or you'll never see him again. Selected. When we leave? I 'll let you know when I own due time. Go home and hold yourself ready. Behold your new papers. Nadia! Something else, General Kriloff? Yes I do. It is very important to me that Mr. Korpanoff arrives safely at Irkutsk. If all goes well, I promise you that your father will be free. If not. Thank you, General. This is exactly the kind of wife I dream forever. Can I withdraw? Here's the money, you'll need it. Thank you. I see nothing else to say at the moment. Ah, so though. You still have your mother, is not it? And she lives in Siberia. Yes, General. In a small village between tomsk and Tobolsk. It is an area that you will definitely cross. Commit no imprudence strogoff captain. Mr. Korpanoff has no mother. Including? Yes, sir, I got it. - Your passport - present your passport control, ladies and gentlemen please. Control. Your papers, gentlemen. Again. We are already asked them this morning. Look, there they are. What you complain, my dear? You represent the order, is it not, well, here it is that the order. But better represent the order, sir blount, even if it is sometimes a bit annoying that represent anarchy like you. Ah, sorry, I represent freedom. It is the same, simple spelling question. French journalist, huh? War correspondent, to be quite accurate. And you are also going to Siberia? Obviously. My readers can not remain indifferent to the restoration of imperial authority. In russia asia. And the conquest of independence by the Tartar people is a problem that fascinates my subscribers, sir. Oh, anyway, when you get there it will be long gone. But yes, it is. All is good? You do not cold? Hot? Hunger? Thirst? Sleep? Oh no, I will take, at least be polite. I was sure that you will end up talking. If I give you the opportunity to say something unpleasant. Forgiveness. Rest assured, I never smoked a pipe. When I got married. Sir, it may be that for this trip is only a matter of joke. For me it is something very serious which wrings my heart and. I 'm more into the circumstances that displease me supremely. And this unpleasant circumstance. It's me? Yes I do. I had to lend myself to this ridiculous comedy because. Because it was the only chance they let me join my father. But I beg you to remember that if I am close to you is against my will. As against the rest of mine. More reason to leave me alone! Your papers are not in order, please get off at the next station. Checked my father. So, how are you. Police, papers, please. Here, Inspector. Miss traveling with you? It's my wife. And you live in Irkutsk? 16 mayska the street, I am trader tissue. You intend to seriously cross the Siberia? With Tartar? Whether or not it is the only way to go home. My store claims me. And Mrs. Accompanied you? Yes I do. After all it is you look at it. I hoped we had forgotten me. You are cold? A little yes, I can do without the coverage that I put in the net. I hope it will be enough, I bought a bit too fast this morning and we took the opportunity to steal. I was sold cotton to wool. There are dishonest people everywhere, even in fabric merchants. Yes I do. You are the police, is not it? The police? I? Why not? I am the daughter of a notorious political exile, General Kriloff probably thought you can extort me some information during the trip. No? I am cloth merchant and nothing else. Sorry to disappoint you. Korpanoff sir, if you were cloth merchant, you would have known earlier that coverage is really wool. And not cotton. Mmmm? I think I'll get some sleep. Good evening. You can smoke a pipe, I love the smell of tobacco. Go to the news. But it is unacceptable, it takes us by boat. I complain to the company. It will work out, man. - Oh no! - do not worry! What time does the ship sail? By police order, not before six o'clock tonight. Here we are with a half day on the arms to spend together. If I embarrassed you too much, let me put in prison, correct me tonight. Ah, I apologize for being clumsy. It's not exactly what I meant. I only thought of that long lost, finally ho, Lost my business. Listen, Nadia. Yes I do. This trip will not be a cakewalk. If you are afraid. Say so frankly, there is still time. I am not afraid. And you, you are afraid? Yes I do. You better have fear before the danger before danger. You understand, miss? They are not for sale. For some sort you can only buy the freedom of one or more of them. And if you have time to make a wish. Before the bird disappeared. The hope is realized automatically. In any case it is a Persian proverb that says so. Even if he is wrong, this is something that you can buy the freedom of the innocent. If that's your thing. Release them all. Excuse me but I had so much to wish for. You do not want me too? . Of course not. It is quite normal between birds we make these small services. Blount. Blount! It amuses you? Well I love animals myself. Oh my dear I abandoned you. Is a bear of Altai, do not you? Yes, you are Siberian? I am negotiating to Irkutsk. I chased the bear once with my father when I was young. Now I just sell their skins. And yours is beautiful. It is not for sale. But then what are you thinking? And if someone came out of the blue? You know that the city is teeming with police officers. Not worry about that, I'm not a child. Perhaps, but in any case you were crazy enough to return to the Russian zone. He had to, I like to watch myself my enemies. You know how it provides for the capture of Ogareff dead or alive? Ten thousand rubles. Ah they might well have still to twenty mile. I worth. You make me afraid, ivan. Do not worry, we are soon away. Tonight we take the boat to perm. Oh, are you finally decide. And I will return soon in nijni Novgorod. And this time without false beard or wig. Was the head of two thousand one hundred Tartar. And they will then see which Ogareff. You did not notice anyone suspicious? Mmmm person. Bourgeois. Couples in love and girls. There's a fool who wanted to buy Chaouk. Maybe you 're wrong? No. No, I know that the tsar will try to send mail to Irkutsk. Because it is the only way left to him to alert the Grand Duke. I am even sure that this man is already underway. It will be an officer, of course the mission is too important, And probably a Siberian because he must know the region. He is obliged to go through perm. And the quickest way to do this is by boat ; it will therefore take the boat. I will take myself, sangarine. And I know a Tsar officer 50 meters under any disguise. Listen up everyone! Listen to me! All! Permissions for Siberia. Are suspended! Passengers must stand again at the police office! Clear to me that, clear! Come on! Come on! - The police station! - come on! Everyone at the police office! Any authorization to Siberia are temporarily suspended. Mmhmm. Tartar revolted. And you know what they do to women who fall into their hands, right? ! They told me. You think that's true? Go, leave me the camp. Oom, oum. Forgiveness. Sorry Sorry. Pavlova. You is something else. Has your own risk of course. I know. - We are not responsible. - I never heard anything official declined my friend. Let's go? - goodbye goodbye. Following. Goodbye. Name, insufficient grounds, to the next. Irkutsk you live? Yes I do. I can not help you to go home, obviously. But you make a mistake. I have my end of the month to insure. It may well be it your all short end! I look at myself! You and your wife together? Yes I do. You know what you risk? Is there a law that prevents a woman to follow her husband? No. But there should have one. Here. Forward, go forward to the next! Gypsy, eh? With you I am calm. A gypsy, that knows their way. Ah, accounts on me. I am king. Again? You still have. For a left-wing journalist. Your game is a little too far right. And you, you 've never. Right for a journalist I find it rather left. Tile. Ah. Heart. Oh no. Oh, I lost against you. You see the couple just happened? Well? The man is the one who wanted to buy Chaouk. The merchant of fabric to Irkutsk. And little is his wife. Then I saw him at the visa office. His name Korpanoff. Irkutsk has, there's a Korpanoff tissue house anyway, they make the calls everywhere. I have the feeling we observe. Sit down. Smiling. What? I find rather curious that a merchant leads his young bride in such an adventure. Not you? We never know. Smiling. But what was watching us? I do not know, I feel that's all. Do not move. Do not you think that you are exaggerating a little? . No. Especially do not look around you. Here. Now come into my arms. And kiss me. No. I am sorry but it is necessary. Obey. No. Obey. If I make you get off at the next stop. I continue my journey alone. You understood? So. I count to three. A. You can count the rest of your days, Mr. Korpanoff. Two. This is a despicable blackmail. You're wrong, it is a true couple in love. And an officer of the Tsar mission mails never embarasserait is a woman, the regulation is formal. Ivan then I believe that the man you're looking for is not on this boat. I begin to fear. Under these conditions it is not necessary that we stay there ourselves, the police might think. We descend the next stop and we join perm by safer means. Listen! I need a car and soon! You all want the same thing, I wanna horses, fast horses. Do you figure some manufactures? Me, I had 40 horses, the army has requisitioned 25 am, the others are retained. What do you want me to do? Wait for me here. Listen to me! Still you? ! If you want to get out of here with a car, you will tackle it yourself! You can read this paper? Excuse me sir. I could not guess, very well. Eh. What you need? In this case I will already adopted by customers beasts. E -e -eh too bad for them, like you. I need a tarantass, three horses and a coachman on. I will arrange. Ah I tackle right away. Egor, come a little! I say, in your person knowledge has taken the Siberian route before me either yesterday or today? E -e -eh yes, yes, there are 2 hours away. 2 men. They chose a telga 2 horses, they seemed very rushed. Come with me! Well? Leave in fifteen minutes. That's what I understood. For a cloth merchant you do miracles. Mmhmm yes. Tighten you against me, you'll be much less shaken. It is the only known way to travel about comfortably tarantass. No! Thank you, I prefer to be shaken. Good. Hey, barine, you do not even franchirais the Urals with the storm that is brewing. Yeah, yeah, i know. I hope you 're not afraid of thunder. It will not be very funny, I warn you. But it was never very funny. On the way! On the way! Careful, the tree! You must clear the road! Is what they are all like you to Irkutsk cloth merchant? - help! - I'm the most stupid! You heard a call! A call? Ah, I see! You know you use it? Yes I do. - Take it. - If in danger? Maybe, I do not want you to stay unarmed. And you? Oh, I prefer that. Warning! Ouch! Yes, I was thinking that this sacred horse was going too fast. Warning! To to to ah! - That - that. Oh, thank you, sir. Ah, I believe that we must make life sir. Do not exaggerate, you have come to get away alone. One day or another. Allow me to introduce myself. Alcide jolivet log order. Harry blount freedom. I call me Nicolas Korpanoff trader fabric Irkutsk. Nadia! Hurry up! You see it's raining! You do not have wrong? Are you sure? The driver, take care of him. He jumped on the bear.

Barine there to a car in front of us. Faster! The horses are tired. Faster! And it would be so boring it comes before us? If we get it to the post after durus there is a safe bet that we will find more fresh horses! Faster! Faster! Go vien boir a glass of tea. There you rest the horses? Yes, the last three. Do tackle them right away, it starts. The journey has not been easy, huh? You go away? To Irkutsk. It's not close. Igor, brings fresh horses and splints them immediately. Then you go to Irkutsk. You know what you do naturally. Let's hope so. You may not know the latest news? Tartar took simensk there two days, the garrison was massacred on the spot. There is no evidence that this is true. I'd like it even seems that Feofar Khan of vanguards reached the banks of the Irtysh. In no time they will be omsk. According to the refugees there are thousands of Tartars in the plains of Krasnoe, and you on it you go to Irkutsk? . Yes I do. And I want to be gone in 20 minutes. Good, igor come and help me to detect. Everything is in order. If the heart tells you? We will be tomorrow night to omsk. Yes to god. And you will be naturally on his right. Excuse me, there's someone there who asks you. Then this is for you who took the last horses? Yes I do. I want them. First come, first served generally, sir. I was the first. I rehearsals you I want these horses. Me too. And my advantage over you is that I have already. No, he will be one of us who can leave. Defend yourself! Defend yourself. For I will spare no you. I will not fight. You do not smite you? No! Shall fight you now? I am a simple merchant. I do not know how to fight. You understand. Splint horses to my car, girls! Well? It often takes more courage to get a behind the kick. Only to give it. But still, good god, you're smuggler? Yes or no? Yes I do. Then go us! No. Mmm. By order of the military authorities the passage from one bank to another of Irtysh is suspended until further notice. Tartar. But we have nothing to fear from the Tartar, my friend, we are French journalists, neutral journalists. Yes I do. Tartar, friends, friends, we, mi -mi -mi, ha- ha. And not cut the head to us, not cut Chopper. Including? Understand nothing. You are sure this is not one of your followers? Ah, no, no! The moment seems to me rather ill chosen to spread out your stock usual pleasantries, Mr. Jolivet. I have to cross the river at all costs. Hey well, going through force. Oh yes. I do not know if you noticed but the man holding a gun. And even admitting that we succeed, how will we do next? You know you drive a tank? Oh, of course. Yeah, probably like horses! Come. Decidedly gentlemen we are made to meet us. Hope, sir Korpanoff, you 'll have more success we decide to cross for us. A-ah. Mr. Korpanoff is the most influential cloth merchant I know. So, how are you? Ah! The fact is that it seems to have pressed the right button. - Demolish the tray. - it will work. Take your luggage, come! No question of loading two cars. We débrouillerons us with one. We cross the river at our peril. This man had been ordered to destroy the tank, we destroy ourselves on the other side. If we will. And if we fail is that the tray will be destroyed himself. What amounts to the same. Nearly. About, my dear, that news? Tartar took Pavlodar. And their vanguards are under the walls of omsk. Dammit, not a post office to send news to paris. Here man. For horses and tarentasse, the rest is for you. This way! Advanced! Advanced! This way! Aaaa - ah, and that I might be sitting quietly at a sidewalk cafe Opera Square reading my newspaper, or even your blount, in a pinch! Advance a little! Here. It'll. Goodbye. Good luck! Thank you. Remember to destroy the tank! It will be done! You have only to break away, the current takes me to the falls. Tartar? Yes, we must turn back. Keep quiet, blount, it would be our death to all and it would be useless! You forget that you are a neutral country. The French do not know remain neutral, Mr. Korpanoff, lack of habit probably. Hold the tarentasse! Faster! Chock the wheels. Quick! Quick. Bravo, Nadia! You know that I begin to admire you? Take cover! Take cover! Come with me. Come. Detach the cable! Attention blount! Clever as you are. Warning! The gaffes! Eh! Eh! Help me! Eh! So we called the raft? Not worth it, he thinks only of escape. Should relieve the tray! Hitch the horse! You really know everything, Nadia. I have a good example, Mr. Korpanoff. I take the horse on the shore. I'll help you clear the bin! It's useless, there to one vote water. We do, my dear? You have nothing to fear. You are in a neutral country. Yes and you? I can try my luck. - This is madness you will not have a chance in a thousand of you out. - We still have one more than if I fell in their hands. Nadia, I must leave you. You forget that a woman must follow her husband. Yes, there are times where trade is more important than marriage. Goodbye. It's already a miracle that she held so far. Yes, she was wonderful. I did not know there were women like her. Now I must leave you. Do what you can for her, I told you the. Tell him. Tell him. What you just said, simply, You do not know that there were women like her. I think that will be enough. Perhaps. You are a very intelligent man, Mr. Jolivet. Goodbye and good luck to you three! You heard Mr. Blount? I am a very intelligent man. You notice that on your notebook. Useless ah, man, sir Korpanoff wanted to leave you with a word gentile, that's all. Here stranded on the banks of the Irtysh. After 17 days have finally managed to cross the Irtysh. Omsk area are now besieged by Tartar troops. Forced continue our journey on foot. You want, sir? Are we can still telegraphing? Naturally, sir. The office closes at 19,30. It is 10 kopeks per note. But the line is not cut? If, but only on the side of Irkutsk. Laugh. Perfect. If we could take him to Paris and put in a jar, our fortune would be made. Yes I do. We hurry, the Tartar approach, I start it right? If you want. Why you? I saw the post the first name? Perhaps, but you got the second. But because I supported Mrs Korpanoff! I am a gentleman, my gentleman! If the roles were reversed I let you telegraph the first! So what are you complaining? That's exactly what I do. Eh? Tartar put a battery in position. Perfect! Perfect! Made my dear, since my despatch will be provided much more than this and you give me time to write. - good. - London- paris newspaper. Tartar bands. Cossack squadron tries to take the Tartar rear. Now that you have said everything if you'll give me instead. In-a-ah, because there with things that you know you but I do not know me. And how? - Well, us you do not know great thing - I do not know great thing, eh? Well, that 's what we'll see sir. Continue, sir. The cicada. Having sung. All summer. Stop. Found himself. Strong and many. - Ah, hell, you will not wire the fables of Lafontaine in your journal all the same! - But if, sir, and I will continue by Victor Hugo! Until closing, until you hear. My command, General withdrawal Irtysh! Resume. Training Cossacks. Ah, I protest! But Monsieur has the right to telegraph what he wants is the regulation. But the Tartar. In the race, I give the Tartars win on Russian. But if the Russians deliver battle, the Tartar will obviously lose. You are injured. Blount! Blount! Oh my God. Blount! Blount! Eh, blount! No jokes, old blount! Shouts. See, we keep your telegram, sir? Come, sir, we continue? Yes, we continue. Our special envoy, Harry blount, Log freedom. Shouts. Journalist me! Fransousky journalist!

You have drunk too much, sleep off your wine go elsewhere! Mich. Michel! What is there? What happened? E -e -eh, she had recognized her son. Likely she was mistaken. It is so old. Besides, I do not see a captain of the Czar mails would do in such a corner. Poor Marfa. It is still strange that a mother does not recognize her own son. You are very sure that his is the captain of the Czar mail? Yeah I do not know but she told me about so often to the village where we lived. His name is Captain michel michel strogoff! Michel strogoff. Was his age can not leave her like that. Must be treated by a doctor. Oooh, what are you I find a doctor in such a mess? I 'll do it, I know where to find one. O- oh. You hear? This is the signal for departure. What am I going to become? I can not stay to wait here with these dogs Tartar that will fall on us from one moment to the other! Not worry about it, I'll take care of it. I also had a mother. You can leave. A-ah, thank you, thank you. On the way! On the way! On the way! On the way! On the way! Mom! - mum mum! - Fear not. Rest. Mom! Mom! Mama- year! Where did you learn to ride? In my village, Kirensk to near Irkutsk. No, you're lying. You lie, the Tartars do not scratch like you. You rode on horseback as a Russian officer. And you took your head. You're wrong, I'm really Kirensk and I 'll prove it! Did you have they taken? In the suburbs of omsk at the time of the assault of the Tartar, I was with the two journalists in a post office. They were released? Yes, they have tried everything to take me but. Everything was useless. And you? I have not been caught, I found the way to take myself. You know this woman? No, I 've never seen in my life. Three columns converge to Irkutsk. Tomorrow morning. The first part of the ekmesk. The second here in Krasnoyarsk. And the third omsk. No need to waste time sitting isolated Russian garrisons we meet on the way. They are powerless. Goal - Irkutsk. We must strike at the heart of Siberia, it is necessary that the city has dropped to 28 days. It will be. Grand Duke has only 12,000 men around him, I would have 300,000. We will attack from the river angara. It was you who led the troops. And it is you who will be found first in the city. I have promised you. Here one minute that will pay me to all others. Who is it?
