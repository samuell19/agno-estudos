The Dark Place (2014) Most people... Most people wish they could remember everything. Me? I just wish I could forget... Anything... Anything at all. ( Music ) No, no, no, but recovering asshole is a very fair term for me. -Recovering? -Okay, ha, ha. I'm trying to be better. I'm not nearly as impulsive as I used to be. I am kinder and gentler. -Humbler? -Yeah, that too. It's a careful balance of all those things that made me fall for you in the first place. -I recall you tripped. -I recall you tripped me. Exactly. Impulsive asshole-ishness. Which you now recovered from. Umm... right. Yeah. I can see how this could maybe be a problem. -Ray? -Not impulsive. I just don't care. Unlike you, I'm taking it apart like it was yours. Broken things force me to fix them... Cars, jukeboxes, you. Ha, ha, ha, ha. I have a fixing problem, okay? You hav an asshole-ishness problem. I think I got the better deal. (In foreign language) Accent is better, but it still doesn't sound flemish yet. -What does it sound like? -Dutch. Ooh. You and the Dutch need to get over this rivalry. As far as we're concerned, you both produce two wonderful things... Chocolates and pot. We, Americans, do not care who produces what. You know what? If you both could pull together and make a product that has both of them, we'd really appreciate that. You could call it, um... Cholliand or belginand nethertuleh euro tasting. I'm thinking, no. Fine. Be difficult. Continue to try to fix that, but you're never gonna get it to work. How would you know? The only thing you fix is coffee, and you break that. I just do. ( Music ) Oh, right. What? Not fair relying on your super majestic... Hyperthymesia mind like a camcorder. While I don't always know what I've seen, I do know that I've seen you try to fix six of these in the last 18 months. -Uh-huh. -And, yeah, you've never gotten it to work. You know what? Seven is not your lucky number. Uh-huh. ( Music ) So when is your mother expecting US? I would like to make it to her, uh, what did you call it, witch cave before dark? You did call her, right? Maybe... not. I may need to reconsider how amusing I find you. Anyways, the phone's dead. Let me borrow yours. It's in the car charging. Well, they have to have one around here somewhere. Um, should I ask my mother to buy you some tulips for our arrival? The Netherlands, tulip people, Belgium, normal people. Accent still sucks. Hey, do you guys have a phone? Yes. Are you going to let me use it? No. Well, you're a deceptively intelligent man. Yes. Buck? I need you to get that stuff from the sub zero so I can talk to the delivery guys, okay? Okay. Buck? Now! Men! Pigs. Hey, you love bacon, so what can you do, right? Dial 9 for the line, bacon boy. ( Dials phone ) ( Phone ringing ) Don't pick up. Don't pick up. Hello? Hello? -There's nothing you can do. -You're such a skank. You have no idea what you're fucking talking about! You're only pawn! You're a pawn! Look, I have it! Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay? ( Car screeching ) We could have waited for the sheriff. I didn't want to get involved. You ran after a thug who beat up a woman. Yeah. I didn't want to get more involved. You did a good thing back there. Hey, would you mind looking for a little road? I always tend to miss it. -Like that one? -Oh, shit. ( Car screeching ) What the fuck? Who was that? ( Music ) Wow. Not bad for a witch cave looks more impressive than it is. -Like you. -Ha, ha, ha. ( Music ) She'll be happy to see you. Maybe. I thought you said this place was dark, gloomy and falling apart. It's time for you to get a... Put me down! Yeah. Mostly. Come on. ( Indiscreet chatter ) Hey, where's your room? Uh, down here. Has an attached bathroom. Pissed my brother off to no end. He get over it? Yeah, by dying. -Call the cops! -Who the hell are you? -Who the fuck are you? -I live here! -I fucking live here! -Enough! -Mother! -Hello, Keegan. Ahh. And who are these people? This is Adrian bishop, my husband. This is my son, Jake, who you just attacked. I didn't attack. Husband? ( Music ) Mother, you don't do romance. Well, I at least romanced once each for you and your brother. Oh, god. Here. This will help with the swelling, sweetie. Wasn't that always my worry? It was a long time ago. I'm sorry about Jake. He's very protective. Of his... his mom? I didn't think it proper for him to call me Celeste or Ms. Dark. He lost his so young. You should've told me. How? Last time you appeared here unannounced, disheveled and high was two years ago. Uh, how did you, uh, meet, um... ? -Adrian. -Adrian? On a cruise last summer. A cruise? Mother. You do not cruise. Ernesto recommended it. I think you two played together in high school. Anyway, best lawyer I ever hired. -Ernie is your lawyer? -Yes. Okay, and we didn't play in high school. Well... after he computerized my records, he did a wonderful job of setting up the ipo. Okay. Hold on. Um, stepbrother, Ernie lawyer, and you're doing an ipo, right? After the winery was doing so well, I took a suggestion, and I went on a cruise. And I met Adrian. We were married six months ago. Mother? I think you've gone completely insane. ( Laughs ) I'm entitled to a little insanity at my age. I love seeing you, Keegan. But are you here for the usual? Because I can't do that anymore. No, mother. I am here for your birthday. I came home for your birthday. My birthday was last month. God, I need a drink. You don't drink anymore. Yeah. That's another one of my problems. Wait, we're, uh, we're in here? Yeah. Adrian said this room is in the best shape. Why? Hey, you suck at basketball, little brother! Keegan? Yeah. It's fine. Hey, guys. Hope you're settling in fine. I'm a great doctor, but I'm a shitty cook. But I can boil water. Yeah, whatever. I appreciate it. Thanks. Look, this is not how I wanted everyone to meet. If you had only said you were coming. No, I'm sorry. What's done is done. I spoke with Jake, and we're going to try for something different tomorrow. -Fair enough? -Sounds wonderful. Keegan? I'm sorry. He's having a mood. Jake was the same way when he lost his mom. In Jake's defense, he was 12. Uh, Keegan's big for his age. Look, if I came home to all this, I may have myself a mood or three, so... again, apologies. Wil, Keegan? Good night. What? No cookies? Hey, bro. How's the head? It, uh, it hurts. How's yours? Fine. You fight like a kitten. Yeah, but I um, I fuck like a stallion, so I've got the better deal. Jump in. We'll race. Yeah, no. Um, I just ate, so, you know, the whole 30 minutes thing. But uh, you know, you uh, go ahead. My dad said I should be nicer to you. So this is me. Nicer. I'm sorry. Uh, I got you all... I'm really sorry. I got you all wet. I didn't mean to. It's fine. Brothers? Stepbrothers anyway? Uh... I'm going to find wil, um, but uh, yeah, don't, um forget to moisturize. Thank you. ( Humming ) I know that tune. Your mom sings it. Yeah, it's her favorite. She's really great. You're lucky you got her. ( Laughs ) Yeah, I guess. ( Celeste) You have to feel it, the way it moves. As the glass is played, swirled, and turned. The light that touches, strokes and dances, illuminating the meniscus. Where the glass stops and then the beauty starts. And then... just then after you've drunk deeply of all these pieces... After you've let it all reach and greet you comes the last moment. The best moment, where you taste it for the first time. Wow. That's wonderful. I didn't know so much went into tasting. Hmm, and the making. It's a craft, a skill and a love. ( Laughs ) Mostly, I just think we contribute to life. No poem was ever written by a water drinker. ( Laughs ) I'm sorry? It was the first thing Adrian ever said to me on our cruise. She was reading a wine magazine, sipping Merlot, and I sauntered up, and I gave it my best shot. All things considered, I'd say a five. You did get me to have dinner with you. I was the luckiest man on the ship. Just on the ship? Maybe one other place, too. Uh-huh. Well, there goes years of therapy, mother. -Hey, morning. -Afternoon. I, uh, came down to see if I could help. Flip flops? Mother, there's nobody around. Did you fix the cooler? Alas, I'm afraid I can only heal bodies and cure illness. Let me see. What's going on? Developing interest around the vineyard. Your mom thinks it'll be even more busy tomorrow when they open back up. I don't understand what's so valuable about this, about this place to investors. Well, dark vineyards is proud to be the premiere supplier and grower of fruit and pulp for a variety of the leading brands. The ipo will provide an infusion of capital that will help US further cement ourselves as leaders in this ancient and important industry. Hmmm, should I clap? No. You should get up early and read the initial public stock offering documents. I didn't know you could just sell grapes like that. It's fascinating. Mother, you've impressed wil and that is hard to do. So, um, what can I do? I think we've about got everything covered. There's nothing? How about go get some vintage from the wine cellar. It'll look nice and will be fun to share. Ten bottles will work. Manual labor, really? Fine. Adrian, if you can't fix it, don't blow yourself up. ( Laughs ) -Celeste, now... -Here, let me help you. ( Beeping ) ( Music ) Boo! Hey, look Keegan, I came out of the closet. Hey, hey, you guys. Hello! Hello! What the fuck happened? The power went out. No, inside. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I think, ah. Look at me. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. No. I'm fine. Good. Fuck! Ernie, what the hell was that for? You deserve worse than that. Just be glad I heard you banging on that door or you'd still be in there. Thanks. ( Music ) So, lawyer? Young, driven and relieved. Awesome. Yeah, well mother's impressed. And you? Wondering what happened to that shy, quiet little kid that I used to get high and fuck around with when we should've been in school. He grew up. ( Wil) It was just a loose board. You knock stuff around and then a bottle hit you on the head. ( Keegan ) No. Someone hit me. I know it. I... I don't know it, but you know, and the power went out. Blown fuse. There's a fault somewhere in the line. There's an old style block as a backup. At this rate, I'm gonna need a new ice machine. I can't possibly understand what possessed you to go climbing on the bottles. Uh, how about, "you go down and get some vintage from the wine cellar. It'll look nice. It'll give US something to share. Ten bottles will work." No. That doesn't sound like something I would say. ( Chuckles ) I'm the funny one, mother. You're the clumsy one. Ernesto, I'm so glad you were here, though I didn't think we had any paperwork to sign until Monday? Uh, no we don't. Um, the server connection died so I just had to come and get a new file. Besides, I wanted to see how things were going with the talking video camera. Mother, congrats on the ledger. Awesome upgrade from the stone tablets used when I was a kid. You really didn't have to walk me out. Great reason to pump you for information about Keegan's younger days. He doesn't really talk about it. Doesn't talk about anything from before we met. I have an idea. How about we go to the silo attic, play spin the bottle and do really tawdry things. Let me guess. It was like this? But hot. Time hasn't been kind. I'm, uh, going to go back and torture mother unless you two want to make out and give me something to watch? Thank you for helping him. -He's a lot to handle. -He's an adventure. My adventure. I get frustrated, though. There's still so much of him locked away. In the dark? I was trying not to use that word. Yeah. I got lost in that once. It didn't end well for me. ( Singing ) -Your mom's scent? -Yeah. It's her favorite. ( Glass breaking ) Keegan. Jake. No, he needs to be arrested, Celeste. I'll handle it. My only concern is you. I know what you've been through, and I can't just sit by and let... I'll handle it! If it's too much, I will take Jake, and we'll go. I know. I know. I'll handle it. I'll handle it. I hope he's a man of his word. You can stay the night. But in the morning... Mom, he's not good for you, and Jake, he is slime. I'm... Doing what you've always done, Keegan. This is how it starts. Small, annoying, and then you spiral out of control. Mom? I love you, Keegan. Sometimes love isn't enough. I hate this place. You got it all to fit? I'm constantly dealing with baggage. For the drive. Hmmm. Did you get this from you truck? I don't own a truck, bro, but don't worry I'll take great care of mom. Come on, kee, let's go. Take care Mr. Bishop. I think you'll be glad to get away from here. San Francisco will be great. You know, actually I forgot that bottle of 1982 in the house the one for your friends. Um, would you mind getting it for me? My mom will know where it is. Sure. -Mrs. Dark? -Yes. I'm sorry. We, uh, forgot the... Keegan! Sorry. My foot slipped. No damn truck. Well, it's nice of wil to deal with the car repairs. Yeah, it's fortunate that I'm sleeping with him. Adrian should have someone out soon to fix the shack. I was fortunate that you are sleeping with him. The yard will take a bit of work, though. Hell, I could sleep with the gardner too. Did you do this out of anger? As payback for me not telling you about the marriage? Mom, I'm worried about you. I think you might be in danger. Oh, from you running me over with a car? Or maybe wood shards from a crashed door. I told you that I understand that you see the world differently from other people. Twenty two times. The first was 15 years eleven months two days ago, ten years, three months, twenty days ago. Then, nine years, nine months, four days ago and then again nine years, two months. Keegan! I told you also that it doesn't mean that you see anything. Nothing is wrong! Believe me! There is no one in my life that could possibly hurt me! Could possibly hurt US! I mean, not any more. -You don't understand, mom! -Yes, I do! I can see it! How's the patient and his worried mother? Please tell me you're not here to give me a sponge bath. A bar of soap would be great right about now. Can I have a moment with Keegan? Man to man. Doctor to patient. Loathed to loather. Are you sure you don't want me to... ? We'll be fine, Celeste. Trust me. You be nice or else. So, is uh, is this point where you try to Bury the hatchet by you telling me I'm being a jerk? Are you being a jerk? I'm not gonna play psycho-babble games with you. Plus, I don't think you're qualified to analyze me. How's this? You're an uncannily smart and perceptive guy. Makes you different, special, but also angry. The result of sins both real and imagined. And it's no different then what the kids I used to work with at the Preston youth correctional facility displayed. It's just you are far more fortunate and can't see it. How'd I do? Oh, I'm cured. ( Laughs ) I had a stepdad, too, Keegan. And once I accepted that he wasn't going anywhere, things changed. We're family. We have to get along. And if not for our sake, then at least for your mother's. My family doesn't include psychopaths. I don't follow. Jake? Ah, you think Jake has a problem? I've seen him hurt people. When? Who? Tell me. I'm here. This girl. I don't know her name or really who she is. I see. You have no reason to believe me. I know that, but I promise you I do... If there is a problem with Jake, I will hear you. I will help you. I'm not your enemy. Okay. If I leave the room without checking your vitals, your mother will objurgate me. That means... To scold or rebuke harshly. I'm intimate with both. Fine, smarty pants. Can you say it in French? ( Laughs ) Touche. Please. Breathe. Again. Good. It's wonderful. Even banged up you're still in good shape. Uh, any medicinal allergies I should know about? In all the hurry, nothing got put on the chart. Um, cheese, cherries and opiates, all except oxycontin. Process of elimination. I'm glad you pointed it out. No medical bracelet or the like? No. I could never find one that would match my eyes. Provided nothing new turns up, we'll release you tomorrow. Sleep tight. Ciao. Oh, yeah. You really fucked the other side up. No, I didn't. My personal idiot did. You sure you want to do that here? It's a good a place as any place else. Yeah, I'm gonna say the, um, motor mount is probably gonna set you back a couple days at least. I figured. The control arm and the wheel bearings are probably wrecked. If the bushings could talk, they'd have pretty sharp words for me, too. You know something about cars, huh? A little. You just don't know anything about people. Keegan dark's your idiot? Uh, yeah. Is that a problem? Just for you. You can't turn a sports car into a pickup truck. You can't turn a bike into a bear. And you sure as hell can't turn a fuck up like Keegan dark into anything, but the shit he always was. Okay. The bride is the long time owner of dark vineyards which has recently seen explosive growth or increase in distribution online wine sales... ( Wil )and prodigal jerks returning to where they aren't wanted. What is today's pet therapy? Angry midget chihuahua? In case you have any more accidents. Um, no I wasn't planning on it. What are you doing here, Jake? We're bros, remember? One big happy family. I'm just seeing how my bro was doing. It's what my dad wants. It's what your mom wants. You stay away from my mother. Why? She likes me. I don't wreck cars. I don't kill people... Shut the fuck. Pain killers are murder on the sense of balance. At the end of the day, as far as everyone else is concerned, I'm nice, sweet, lovable. But mostly I'm not you. Be safe, bro. It's just you and me today. Keegan texted from the hospital. He's not enjoying it. Good. Hmmm. Well, you know? I'm always amazed when I think of the thousands of years of hope and effort behind the seeds that Keegan's great grandfather planted here. Then when you take these, make them into wine... We're drinking time. Maybe even love. Confession. I'm obsessed with that broken sprinkler in the fields. -But that's been broken for... -It's weird, I know, especially after the beautiful thing you just said. But, I can't seem to figure out if I have to fix a problem with a broken spring or just bad pressure in the line, and it's driving me nuts. You have met my son, right? You have a thing? It's endearing, wil. -A thing? -Yes. Keegan has a thing? You have a thing. Probably why he lets you in so close. I'm not sure he does. He hasn't told me about you until last week. Well, he used to introduce me as the maid. ( Laughs ) Yes, and I can't clean worth a damn. He knows that. I mean, dusting? Forget it. Laundry? Ah, mystery. But, I can shoot a pistol, and I have often considered doing that to my washer. ( Laughs ) I didn't expect you to be funny like Keegan. No one ever does, especially Keegan. Wil, don't kill yourself trying to fix Keegan. I've tried again and again. Hope and effort. Right? Good lunch? Um, bummed I couldn't get the filet mignon. Well, your health plan doesn't really cover that, Mr. Dark. Um... typical. Does it cover foot massage? Oh yeah, sometimes that... Mr. Dark? Are you okay? Calm down. Calm down. -What's going on? -He just started spazzing out! ( Grunts ) Allergy to opiates. It's not in his chart. But wouldn't incompetence better explain it? I had just told Adrian about my allergy. He asked me about severe allergies. I don't know about here but in antwerp, doctors actually ask those kind of questions. Oh, and they give you a piece of Belgium chocolate, right? Only on Tuesdays. So, is it Jake or Adrian who is after you? Do you believe me or not? I want to believe you. I know you're scared, but are you sure this entire Jake, Adrian thing isn't just in your head? Everything's in my head. ( Music ) -What are we doing? -Just contemplating murder. Your wit isn't that sharp. What are we doing? -I'm following Jake. -Why? -Because you said to. -I'm pretty sure I didn't. Um, are you sure this whole Jake, Adrian thing isn't just in your head? I'm pretty sure this isn't me being in my head. Even in the states, I think stalking is rather mental. Go back to the house. No. Wherever you go, I go. Shhh. Are you sure he went in here? I would be more certain if you know you hadn't distracted me. It doesn't look like anyone's been here in a long time. Yeah, it's suspicious, right? I reserve a biting devastating answer for a future moment of my choosing. Come on. Are you sure about this? -Stay here if you want. -No. You know how much I love getting down on my knees for you. What do you see? It's dark. Grandfather ran this place around the clock. Economics forced my father to slow it. And then mother shuttered it completely shortly after he... She closed it. How did your dad die? What would Jake want in a place like this? Pw. -What? -Pw and aw? Pre-wil, after-wil? Everything before we met. Your mom, your dad, your dead brother you won't talk about. That's pw. Now aw, you love talking about that. We'll cover more ground if we split up. Wa. Wrong fucking answer. Ammonia. Hey, bro. How's it hanging. Mom's not gonna like it if we don't play nice. ( Grunts ) She's definitely not gonna like that. Why are you following me? I'm just researching psychopaths. Keegan! Your boyfriend sure is accident prone. It was just a friendly conversation. It didn't look like it was a friendly conversation. It was nothing. You were mistaken. Really. It was fine. Keegan, don't make US... Will you just level with me? I'm trying to fucking help you. ( Celeste )keegan? Hey, look. I don't need any. I'm gonna go see what my mother wants. Okay? I'll be done in a second. ( Sighs ) Between you and father, I count 42 times that I've been summoned in here to stand quietly just like now. You know, you could use your computer to do your accounting? Would you like some tea? No, and you are still scaring me, mother. The lighting, brings out my fangs. Um, your jokes are, uh... Good? The operative word is good. Just nod your head and agree. When I left here, Celeste dark could not run a business and take a trip, get married or even tell a joke. You've changed. A lot. Maybe you have, too. Maybe we both have. And maybe I should've seen that. Do you have, um, did you get... -Keegan? -Mom, please. Don't make nice if you're just gonna kick me out again. Keegan, I want you to stay. Okay? In the morning, we'll go to breakfast. You and me. And you can tell me everything. I'd like that. Good. Get some sleep. Do you want me to tuck you in? Mother, I, uh, sleep naked. People will talk. Something strange just happened. Do you love me? What? It's a simple question. Do you love me? Why would you think that I don't? I blew you away. You don't tell me things, Keegan. You push me away then you pull me close. I never see all of you. Why don't you trust me more? I really want to know you, kee. I love you. I love you. I want to know everything! Tell me, Keegan! Tell me! I can fix this. I can. I gave you what you wanted. You fucked me to shut me up. You fucked me! Give me one reason to stay. If you can't by morning, I'm gone. I'm tired of secrets. Wil... ( Music ) Stupid kid! Why the hell was he back there? Dumb shit was taking something! Drive faster! Get the rope! ( Crash ) Ahhh! Ahhhh! Keegan! Keegan! Wake up, Keegan! Wake up! Get off me! What are you doing? Something's happened. But her eyes are open. It's part of the trauma... tumor. And this is the way you found her? Yeah, unresponsive to everything. And, uh, tell me again about the night. I know it's hard. Uh, came into the living room, and she was just laying there on the couch. Like she was taking a nap, but uh... -She wasn't? -No. She was unresponsive so I called 911. ( Officer )right, and we still don't know what caused this? ( Adrian )no. Nothing's come back. ( Officer )oh. So you did blood work? When do you get the results of that back? We need to send them to the crime lab. You promised. ( Phone ) Hi. You have reached the engineering services. Please leave a message. Thank you. Hey, it's me. Um, I could really use you right now, so uh, please don't leave me. Sucks not having anyone to sing with, huh bro? -What did you do to her? -That's enough! That is enough! I didn't know you loved me so much. -Go home, Mr. Dark. -How? We live in the same house. Find a new one! You want me to follow him, sheriff? I want you to pick a restaurant for lunch and then I want you to tell me every little bit of gossip you can about the dark family starting with that one. Zero, six. One, zero, six. It's kind of far from the vending machines, but that's not a problem unless you have a midnight craving. Do you have midnight cravings? -Yeah. -Yeah, me too. You want your key? By morning, I'm gone. By morning, I'm gone. This is how it starts. Ahhh! Shut up! No, I don't like it either. But, I was facing huge penalties on the renovation. I just had to move forward with this. That's an antique. Package it better, please. Thank you. Kee, may I call you that? There's a very real chance that she will never wake up. She may stay in her coma for the rest of her life. Look at this. I had the architect redesign the unused servant's quarters up in the loft. I'm creating a private nursing facility for Celeste. No institutions for her. Jakey, that's got to be murder on your back! Please be careful! Yeah, but she's my mother. But he's her husband and a doctor. And no one, not even the priest is to see her without Dr. Bishop's permission. You're welcome to wait with your brother until Dr. Bishop gets here. ( Music ) Wouldn't my office have worked better? I'm, uh, kind of having some car troubles right now. Plus, they're not in. So... Ahhh, Dr. Bishop and his son? Yeah. The home renovators from hell. Renovation isn't a crime usually. Yeah, well it's not just the renovation. It's the money. It's the stock offering. It's the fact that I can't see my own mother without their permission. Not a crime. Yeah, but they're pushing me out of my own life. Didn't you do that a long time ago? You really should've come down to my office. It's a nice office. Good place to talk. I even put curtains up. Made 'em myself. Female touch I bring to the job, though, I am a little worried one day I'll have to punch someone to remind them that though I'm beautiful, I'm still the boss. ( Laughs ) I have that problem too. Um, so you... You don't believe me? That Adrian and/or Jake are out to get your estate? Nah. I just don't see it. I do. With that perfect memory, hyperthymestic thing of yours? I looked it up. Yay for the Internet, huh? Nice gift to have. Don't miss a detail. Hard to trip you up. Keeps you one or two steps ahead of everyone else. Plus, I never forget birthdays, and I kill in Vegas. What's your point? You could construct a perfect crime with it. It's much easier just to be the perfect asshole. You could, say, have your father and brother race a teenage you to the hospital on a fake drug overdose. If you used that brain of yours to set everything up right, you could crash the car. Make it look like an accident. US mere mortals would never know. Yeah. My father and my brother, they did die in a car accident. They died. You lived. My predecessor sent every kid who even smelled a drug to state juvie. They were still using the castle. You skated. You got rehab. You got a nice trust fund. Yeah, and you are nuts. And your mother is in the hospital on the verge of death, leaving you with more money. Every time you're around, kid, something bad happens and you get... But Adrian and Jake benefit this time, sheriff. Not me. That gives me more reason not to let you near 'em, huh Keegan? What the fuck are you doing with my money? Ernie? The cops are threatening the castle if I don't talk. -We bought it together. -For the party. So you shouldn't have used it at home. You look terrible. -I've been in a car accident. -No. There's something else. I should've just died. I'm glad you didn't. -Ow. -Sorry. I'll tell the cops. I promise. Sorry. The door was open? Wide open. I wanted to write you a note, but I couldn't find a pen. Yeah, well. Rooms with pens cost extra. So, where's your boyfriend? I ran him off. You know me. I guess that smile, a sharp tongue and a big dick can only get ya so far, huh? It got you through law school... In spite of me. Actually, that was hard work, luck and not relying on arrogant rich kids to do anything for me. Like I said, I just wanted to see how your mom was doing. The ipo is still on track. Things will be fine for her when she gets better. -If... -She will. Thanks. Did you ever love me? ( Music ) Hey, um, that waitress, the one that I helped who was hit by the guy in the red truck? Do you know where she is? Yep. But you're not gonna tell me? Asshole. 6v39803. Son of a bitch. Why shouldn't I kill you now and then claim self defense? Because I'm too pretty to kill. I wouldn't bet on that. You're bacon boy. Yeah, also known as bacon, lettuce and tomato boy or peanut butter and bacon boy. You tried to help me. Why? I have a thing about women being hit. Bad memories. So you don't work for Jake? He's my stepbrother. You're that guy. You know, he's gonna kill you, right? Yeah. I got that. Maybe you could untie me and tell me a little more about his murderess impulses. You know, he was nice once, in high school. At least to me. He loved me not like the other girls. Then he got in trouble, and he went away. And when he came back in the castle, he wasn't nice to me anymore. You're, uh, not worried that he's gonna try and hurt you again? I've got insurance. What kind of insurance? Uh, could you tell me anything about his father? Father. He had so many fathers. Fathers and their fingers. When he went to the castle, he learned how to use his fists, so I ran away. I ran far away. But his voice, his smile just... He told me had this idea about money so I came back for him. And he said it was just gonna be you and me. And it will be once all of this is over. And there won't be any more fists. Look, I need your help. And I promise I won't use my fists. I need you to tell the sheriff everything you know. I told you. He's not gonna kill me. I have insurance. And you should get some, too. Insurance? That's what was in that envelope that day. That's why Jake hit you. I don't know what you're talking about. -Hey! -Whoa. What kind of insurance was in one of these envelopes? You should leave. Oh, or should I tell the police about the fake dark vineyard's wine in your hand. Ooh, I can still smell the ammonia that you used to get this label off a real bottle. And the wine... Uh, yeah, shitty stuff. It's fake. And selling it to the public he did is a crime. I'll just tell the cops that Jake gave it to me, which is the truth. And uh, what about the truck registered in your name? He made me. Yeah, okay. I, uh... I'm starting to see what Jake was doing. Steal a few bottles of good wine, for those who'd know it, fake the rest for those who don't, and sell them through a middle woman for pure profit. Hide the theft. Clobber anybody that gets in the way. There's a certain, uh, dumb directness to it. It's so very Jake. But there's more, isn't there? Now, to be honest, i'm really bad with threats, but um, I'm gonna try. You tell me what was in that envelope or I tell Jake that you betrayed him. Give it back! These aren't supposed to be out until next week. You shouldn't have this. Finally, something for me to show him. He's got tons of those in his leather bag. When I showed him the copy of that one, he was real pissed. He's gonna be rich, and he's gonna make me rich, too so I don't tell anyone. And you're not gonna tell anyone either. Give it back, bacon boy! I'm serious! Whoa now. That's an awfully big gun for such a little girl. Not that little. Don't! ( Shower ) ( Moaning ) ( Phone ringing ) What? Now? What is it? Keegan's here. -Wait, how was it? -It was great. Uh, there's this local band and he showed me this awesome... I came here to get you. I came here irrationally, stupidly, impulsively just like you and everyone always says I am. But I don't know what to do. I don't even know where to go. If either of you says visiting hours are over, Mr. Dark, I will sue. You can't send her home. I just told you after the ipo, he is gonna kill her. They're gonna kill her. That is exactly what I've been dealing with. Since he's got here, he's unbalanced, paranoid. You're acting like... Fuck you. You have no idea the kind of issues that's going to cause. Delusional! We're his sex fantasies... Okay. Everybody out! Please! Keegan! Not you! Her death will be your fault. And your gain. If I wanted to kill her, don't you think I would've already tried? I do think you already tried. Nelson. You ever read a medical book, Keegan? Yeah, I researched autoerotic asphyxiation when I was 13. That went over well with the maid. Those are calcium blockers. In large enough doses, they can cause the kind of coma your mother is in. Well, Adrian is a doctor. And Adrian would know how to do that kind of stuff! So would someone with your memory, and these were found in your car. Skip, the mechanic, is real thorough. Yeah, well they could've been planted. They could've been there all along. Guess which is more likely? Finally, I got the last word. I think you need to come down to my office and wait for the medical report on your mother's blood to come back in. It'll be fun. I have brownies. Made 'em myself. Like I said, female touch. Would you mind if we stopped and got some ice cream on the way? You better not be leading me on a wild goose chase, Keegan dark. Hey, Wendy, it's Keegan. It's bacon boy. Look, I'm really sorry that I burned your... I suppose this just looks worse than it is, right? Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I led you here. You can't think I had something to do with this. You are just way too much work, kid. You obviously should've been spanked more as a child. ( Buzzing ) Sorry. Oh, look. I really, really need your help. Certificate number zq030452. -It doesn't come up. -That's the number. There's no record of it being sold. But if Jake is so well connected, they may have hidden it. I don't know without seeing it. I can't... -Well, I can see it... -But I can't. So you're just gonna what? Give up? After the offering is concluded, there might be a way. She'll be dead by then. Me too. I know a way to get you out of town. Can your boyfriend help? No, he's gone. Sucks when people you love betray you, huh? -Do you still hate me? -I do. Or, I did. I don't know. I believed in you. I still believed in you after my trial. I still believed in you when I was sentenced to the Preston youth correctional facility. I still believed when I saw that place, the castle looming ahead of me. Still believed the first time I was beaten. I hated you after that. -I'm sorry. -You fuck up, Keegan. Bad, but so did I. Somebody pointed that out to me, and the system helped me. Now here I am able to help you. Funny, right? Go wash up. I'll keep working on this. I still hate you. They were still using the castle down in Preston back then. Cops are threatening me with castle if I don't tell 'em. He was at the castle. I still believed, and I got sentenced to the Preston youth correctional facility. The kids I used to work with at the Preston youth correctional facility. Preston youth correctional facility. -Castle. -Castle. Preston youth correctional facility. Castle. Hey, wake up. I'm gonna get my life back. I think it's a good plan. -It's kind of rash. -Works for me. -I can't kill anyone, though. -I can. I'm not that stupid kid anymore. Come on. ( Ringing ) Hello, Jake. Is your... Is Adrian here? Ahh, sheriff? I wasn't expecting you. With all the financial wonderment of tomorrow, my son and I were celebrating a little bit early. Your son died ten years ago. Found that out from a new tip on the tip line. He had his mother's last name, so it was hard to track but surprise, there it was. Now, I wonder what other surprises are lurking about. Stall them! I have to find my mother. Just stall them. ( Music ) That's far enough, kiddo! She demanded to come down. Since I don't know what anyone here is actually up to, let's just have you step away from your mommy, okay? Look, I need to see her. Okay? No. Don't. Shoot him! He's right there! Oh my god! Oh my god! I thought you left. I never left! I was tied up this entire time. Did Jake do this? No. ( Gunshot ) Oh my! I told you I hate you. -You didn't have to do that. -You knew? -I guess. -About all three of US? All three? Oh, hot! So, wait, all of this was because of a mistake that I made what years ago? You made a little more than just a mistake. At first I just came for the money and then I saw your face. Our plan was gut the company and then get out. And then I realized that I could hurt you. How much did you figure out? Most of it. I realized that I heard the words Preston and the castle 7 times with four different people, and it all intersected with you. You hit me while cleaning up Jake's skimming of the wine bottles. You broke into my room to see how much I knew, killed Wendy shortly after following me there. Destroyed Celeste's ledger because that in my brain are the only two things to contradict the computer records that you forged, and you planted the drugs that framed me for my mother's coma. Actually that was me. You? I was busy. There was a lot to do. Fine, fine. Jake planted the drugs that framed me for my mother's coma. -Happy? -Yeah. -Yep. -And me? What did I do to you? You love him. You should've let me kill him! You got mad when I tried to do it at the hospital. You had to sleep with him? One last time! -You slept with Ernie? -If you didn't have shower time with Jake, you could've caught him. -You left. -He had needs. I was kidnapped. You couldn't keep your hands off me after we had the house to ourselves! -I didn't know that! -You ran around saying... Okay! Okay! This is why we only have sex when the three of US are together. -You had a four-gy? -I didn't do anything on purpose! -Enough! -Freeze! Drop your gun! ( Gunshot ) Run! No. I'll distract him. You get as far away from here as you can! Find help! And I love you! I'm not sure I believe that. Still not sure. Jake, bring me Keegan. Alive, Jake. Jake? Go, go get 'em! He can't have gone far. ( Car alarm ) ( Gunshots ) Ugh! Come out. Come out wherever you are. I'm gonna shoot you. You're not even making this fun. Shit! I have the master key, you moron! This is Adrian! He's gonna be the fall guy! He's fucking Ernie! I'm so looking forward to this! ( Buzzing ) ( Laughing ) Where is my mother? Where is my mother? Where is my mother? I guess you should've worn a helmet, bro! ( Music ) Which hand do you like to Jack off with, Keegan? I'm ambidextrous. Why? Move, move, move! You know, my stepfather had certain ideas about correcting problems. When my mother found that i'd ruined expensive sheets with my self-love she asked him to make sure it never happened again. Put your hand in the disposal, Keegan. Put a bullet in your leg and still get your hand in the drain. Night after night, he would wake me up. He'd say, "I know you've been doing it again." He'd bring me downstairs after the beatings, after making me Jack off with tiger balm. He put my hand in the drain just like this. Put it in deeper, Keegan. "Tonight's the night," he'd say, and he'd reach for the switch. I actually believed he would do it. But for all his terror, he didn't have it in him to flick the switch. Unlike me. ( Screams ) Therapy? Are you open to therapy? -Yeah! -Therapy helps people deal with their anger issues! Yeah, I'll go! -Have you found Celeste? -I don't know where she is. -She's not upstairs. -Upstairs. Up, up, you're beautiful! The loft. Come with me! Mother! Mother! Celeste, can you hear me? She can see you. The drugs Adrian gave her are wearing off. She can see US. She just can't respond yet. It's got to be terrifying. So what now? You kill her? I'm not gonna kill her, Keegan. You are. I doubt that. -Let him go! -No. I know what it is to hate, to hate the people that you love like this wooden shoe wearing tulip muncher does you. Those are deductions. Why did you come home? I came home for her birthday. Why did you come home? Like I said, I came home for her birthday! You have perfect fucking memory! You knew it wasn't her birthday! Yes. So why? After the accident, I was in so much pain... On the stairs that night when we were kids. It was in your eyes. Yes. I didn't understand it then, but I do now. I see it every time I think of you. Betrayal! -Hate! -Yes. Your father, dead. Golden child, brother dead. You barely holding on. You, terrified. You terrified and fighting for your life. -Your mother... -She leaned in. She didn't think that I was awake, that I was recording, but I was. What did she say? She said, "you should've died. Not them!" She hurt me, so I hurt her again and again. But it stops now! Once and for all! Kill her! ( Gunshot ) I did come home to end it. I came home to forgive her and to ask her to forgive me because that's what people who love each other do. Something else to hate you for. Let him go! Why? If you can't shoot her, then you certainly can't shoot me. I on the other hand don't have that problem. One more thing, Ernie. Don't look up! You're lucky I'm not wearing wooden shoes! Come on. Let's give them some privacy. ( Grunting ) I hope mom isn't mad at me for killing you. ( Gunshot ) I'm not your mother! ( Music ) Hey. Hi. You feeling any better? It's amazing what a chemically-induced coma caused by a murderous ex-husband, his psycho boy toy and a bitter lawyer can do for your health. Um, I know it's late, but... Okay. Vitis vinifera. Supposedly, those are the kind of seeds that started wine making thousands of years ago. -Definitely not as valuable as ours, but... -They're beautiful. They're beautiful. Looks like somebody's waiting for you. I'll be back in a little bit. You gonna be okay? Yeah. Yeah. -Okay. -Okay. Keegan... In the hospital. I never should've said... Honestly, mom. I don't remember what you said. Nice car. I'm working on it. It's temperamental. Dinged up. Well passed it's prime and not nearly as sexy as it thinks it is. It's classic. I'm more likely to whack it if it gets out of line again. Fair enough. You know, I did find a reason to stay that night. You. I love you, too. I know.
