(funk/hip hop music) * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash * whitewash (laughter) * Do you know what's up (children laughing) - Let me repeat. This is a whole number. (laughter) If we move the decimal one space it's called a tenth. (laughter) If we move it 2 spaces, it's a hundredth. Three spaces is a thousandth. Now, every time we move a decimal point 2 spaces, what do we come up with? - Nothing. (laughter) - Zero. (laughter) - We multiply or divide the number by 100. - [Teacher] Yes, Helene Angel, that's correct. (laughter) - 100% of this class will be at detention if you don't behave. (students giggling) I repeat, this is called a tenth. This is a hundredth. If we move the decimal two spaces it's called a thousandth. Now, all right you three, please come up here and write in words the equivalent of these numbers. (students giggling) Sometime today, please, Helene. (students giggling) (bell rings) - Oh, I'm sorry Ms. Steunberg, I guess I'm going to have to do it tomorrow. (children laugh) - You most certainly shall, young lady. Please do the exercise on page 384 and 386 in your math books and don't forget your history projects are due in two days, no excuses! (light synthesizer music) - What's the matter, your mom won't let you cross the street alone yet? - Aw, hush up, you don't know what you're talking about. - I do. - You do what? - Know you can't go no place 'til Mauricio comes to get ya. - Who's Mauricio? - Helene's big brother, that's who. - Uh oh, I'm scared of you. (laughter) - You better be, cause here he comes now! (hip hop music) (laughter) - Y'all got something to say to me? - Don't nobody have nothing to say to you. - You think I like doing this? Picking up a girl as big as you? You my sister, you think I get off on this? - Well, I know I sure don't. I've got to sit around until you decide to think "Oh, I forgot my sister." (car horn honks) - Only forgot you twice, and you know it. - Three times, three times you forgot all about me! - Well, maybe. - Well, maybe nothing. I just wish I could go home on my own. - You ain't the only one. I told you, I was doing everything I could... - Where do you think you're going, niggas? - Any place you ain't, now move out of our way man. - Are you telling me what to do? - Come on girl, move. - Don't you hear what a white man had to say? - There ain't no man around here, just some simple-minded punks. - Uh oh, I believe we got some trouble here. This boy don't understand English. - Hey, we know these people don't speak English too good, so how could they understand you? (boys laugh) - I think I got an idea of what you do understand. Give me your money, all your gold jewelry, and your rings. (gasps) - Hey! (suspenseful music) - Ow, stop, stop! - She's got only 49 cents? (grunts) - Run, Helene! - Yo, hold on, hold on. - Mauricio, wait! Mauricio! - Looks like she doesn't want to play with us, huh? - Let's leave them alone, these kids got nothing. - We got something for you, nigga, and you're not going anywhere until we say, right? - What are you guys doing? - Let's get out of here. - Come on, let's go! - We're going to do you a good deed, girl. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Hold her! Today, you'll see what it's like to be white. (paint sprays) - Come on, man, what are you doing? Let's go! - Hey, what do you think you're doing? - Shut up, black boy, you're next! (paint sprays) - Come on, Helene Angel, it's okay, it's okay. (piano music) - Now, don't you fret, sweetheart, nanna's going to get all this mess right off you. They're going to see your pretty little face just like it always was, you'll see. Nobody will ever know the difference. - Nanna, I, I tried to fight them off. I was outnumbered, I told you! - Mauricio, it wasn't your fault. You told me a million times and I believe you. Now, get me some of the baby oil so I can finish your sister's face here. - But nanna, I thought when you have injuries like mine, from being beat half to death, you're supposed to put a piece of cold, raw steak on it, like in the movies. - I got no steak to put anywhere except on my table, and you got less than one second to get me that baby oil. - Yeah, like I ain't hurt too. - Helene Angel, baby, it's going to be all right, don't you worry. Nobody's going to be hurting you anymore. Now, I'll see to it, you hear. It's going to be just fine. (piano music) (sirens) (hip hop music) (people talking) - Please, no photographs. - [Voiceover] Is this off the record, officer? - No, no, it's just routine, just routine. - How routine is it, officer, for a child to be painted white in the Bronx? - That's not what she meant, and you know it. - Does she have to be in the hospital? - Would you consider this a hate crime? - As opposed to what, a nice crime? - Do you have any leads? - I have nothing more to say. (people shouting) - [Voiceover] There she is! Can we get a statement? - [Nanna] Well I don't know what more you want from the children. - [Police Inspector] Just a couple more questions, ma'am. - [Nanna] I just want to know how long you're going to let them get away with this. We came up from the south to get away from this very thing. - [Police Inspector] Yes ma'am, we know. It's a terrible thing that happened to your granddaughter, but random violence, - What random you talking bout? It was the Hawks who had done it. They painted Helene Angel's face. - Are you sure? I mean, could you identify them? - No way, I couldn't, they were all over me. I was doing everything I could, but I couldn't get to Helene Angel. There were lots of them. No, really, I thought they'd kill me, I mean, um, paint me too. What could I do? - That's all right son, we understand. (saxophone music) - Don't son me, don't son me. - Today, a fourth grade student in the Bronx was attacked by a group of thugs - This afternoon, a young girl who was simply walking home from school was brutually attacked. - According to the police commissioner, the assailants have not yet been identified. - Although no motive has been established, police are not ruling out drug-related disputes, turf battles, or hate crimes. After this short break, we'll have Stone with sports. - Did you see me Nanna? I was on the TV! - How could I miss you? (eerie dream music) - Looks like she doesn't want to play with us, huh? - Hey! (grunts) Stop! Run Helene! - We got something for you, nigga. Today you'll see what it's like to be white. (suspenseful music) (gasps) (cries) - She lives down the block from me. I spoke to her grandma yesterday. She said that, um, she's really afraid to come outside. - Why would somebody want to do something like that? Was she in a gang or something? - Helene Angel's not in any gang, she was just walking home from school and got beat up from some kids. I tried to get her to come out but she won't talk to anyone. Anyway, you can't get close to the house. There's all these TV people and stuff. - So, is she coming back to school? - I don't know, Mrs. Calloway says she won't even come out of her room. (bell rings) (clears throat) - Rafael Brown? - Here. - Suzanne Canady? - Here. - Helene Angel Calloway? (silence) (cries) It's okay, Lori, it's okay. It was a horrible thing, but it'll be okay. You all know that what happened to Helene Angel was a cruel and terrible thing. I know how it made me feel. I am hurt and angry all at the same time. I wonder how you feel? Would anyone like to tell me? - I'm terrified. - Scared and terrified. - I'm terrified. - Dangerous and terrible. - It was terrible. - If someone did that to me, I'd be afraid to come back to school, too. - I think that that person might, you know, might not be happy if someone did that to them. - I don't know why someone would do something like that. Helene Angel was just minding her own business. - Yeah. - I think they need more security guards. - Yeah. (students talking all at once) - We should have security guards to help kids in the class cross the street because then it's as simple as if something happens, they could notify the police or anything, or stop the person or something. - I think I'll come back to school with them and then tell them that there's nothing to be scared about because if it happened once, it might not happen again. - Maybe they should get all the kids in the school to walk with them so maybe the person wouldn't try to mug them with all those people around. - Yeah, maybe if we all walk Helene Angel to school, maybe she won't be so afraid. (students agree) - If you all feel so strongly, maybe what we should do is let Helene Angel know that. Why don't we each write her a letter, so that Helene Angel will know how much we care about her, and how much we want her to come back? (steady piano music) - No sir, I won't let you talk to her, and I want you to leave us alone. Things are tough enough around here without you bothering us to death. (steady piano music) - Do you want any lunch, honey? Now, you can't lock yourself in there forever, child. (sighs) - Any problems? - Nah, it's just hard getting through the door with all those news guys outside. - They'll go away soon. - Were we on TV again today? - I'm hungry, dinner ready? - Knock on the door and see if you can get your sister to join us. - Here I am, Chuck, two days after the incident in the Bronx where a young girl was a victim of a brutal attack by a gang of thugs known as The Hawks. The young girl was painted white with a bottle of shoe polish. Police have not come up with any clues as to who the Hawks are nor whether there is proof that any crime actually occurred. (knocks on door) - Come on, Helene Angel, you can't stay in your room forever, dinner's ready. Nanna wants you to come out, you hear? Look, you gotta face up to it. It ain't gonna get no better until you do. - Hello. - Mail. - Oh, thank you. (light synthesizer music) Helene Angel? Look, child, look at all this mail that came for you. (upbeat piano music) Helene Angel, darling, I know this has been a truly rough time for you, but now you got to stand up and keep on living. You have to remember that you're the same Helene Angel just as beautiful outside as you are inside. Let me tell you something, when I was your age in Georgia, children just like you stood up to dogs and fire hoses and the police themselves just so we could do what everybody else did, go to restaurants, try on clothes in stores, ride buses and trains, worship without being bombed, and believe you me, I was plenty scared. I kept asking myself, how much could I stand? People calling me such terrible names and beating on us, young as we were. - Let freedom ring from... - [Nanna] But I heard Dr. King speak in my church and I knew I couldn't give up. - [Dr. King] ...and singing the words of the old negros... - [Nanna] Because if I gave up what I believed in, I would end up with nothing. (gospel music) You are very precious to me, now. Those boys hurt you, but they are the ugly ones. You have to see that and always remember that. (upbeat gospel music) Darling, I want you to go back to school tomorrow. - Yes ma'am. (light synthesizer music) - Where is that book? I need it for my test! - Well you should've put it away. Are you sure you had it here? - Yes, I was doing my homework right in front of the TV. - You left it in the bathroom, like usual. (doorbell rings) - Why won't they leave us alone? Hello? - Hello Mrs. Calloway, is Helene Angel home? - We really missed you in class Helene Angel. We don't like what happened to you at all. We know it's tough, and we wanted to show you that you're not alone. - We got up early so we could all walk to school together. - And we'll walk back together. - We're all together. - And no one's going to beat on us no more. (sniffles) - [Nanna] See, you don't have to worry anymore. You've got company. - Nanna, I'm going to school. - Good, baby, that's good. (children cheer) (hip hop music) * Friends of friends we're on the same team * We're helping each other if you know what I mean * Black, white, yellow or brown * We're all together and we're getting down * In school or on the street * If we help each other we can't be beat * Cause all alone it's hard to survive * But if we're in it together we can stay alive * You and me * There ain't no stopping what we can be - Wait for me! * You and me, hey, just wait and see * You and me there aint no stopping what we can be * You and me, hey, just wait and see * We've got to be friends like sister and brother * Working together and helping one another * If you know somebody who's getting in trouble * Give them a hand and on the double * In school or on the street * If we help each other we can't be beat * Cause all alone it's hard to be strong * But working together we can't go wrong * You and me there ain't no stopping what we can be * You and me, hey, just wait and see * You and me there ain't no stopping what we can be * You and me, hey, just wait and see * You and me there ain't no stopping what we can be * You and me just wait and see
