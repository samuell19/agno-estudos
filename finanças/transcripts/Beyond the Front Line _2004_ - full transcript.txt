Mangs, take a picture of Hel?n and me. - Sure. Press there. That's S?derman's box. The small one. Listen to what S?derman wrote. "If I get killed, I want to die like a Finnish soldier." And he did. Fire! "Our last respects to our brave comrade in arms" - "Corporal Bertel S?derman." "Rest in peace. Your friends at the front." Dear friends and family of Bertel S?derman. My talented young student had his whole life ahead of him. But destiny decided otherwise. Even in grim circumstances Bertel remained humane. And he was also a brave soldier. There is no greater sacrifice - than giving his life for his comrades. Now we'll carry his memory with us - which is as bright as the marble in the ballroom of the school. His name will be engraved in it - where it will shine for the following generations. I've lost so many great boys. What are your plans? No matter how the war ends. I don't know. I've enquired about degree requirements from the university. You've always been interested in everything. Good luck, my friend. - Thank you, headmaster. You know your mission. Take a prisoner and recon in the Russkie hinterland. Good luck. Strike groups! Mines! We'll stop here. Lindblad, go further back with Olof and Kanckos. We'll try capturing a lone Russkie. It must be done in silence. No gun fire! Capturing many is too risky. We're too far behind the lines. Let them go. We would have to fire. Look at those clothes. Next time someone says that Russkies have bad uniforms, I'll beat them! No more Russkies, I guess. Let's go home and continue tomorrow. Harry! Don't move! It's clear now. Ufa! You must leave me here. Go on! There's no point in you staying here! J?rv hit a mine. Dammit, boys! We can't leave him even if he ordered us. I'm going back. As I was laying there I thtught abtut bttks - I hadn't read yet. I thtught tf all the pretty girls I'd never get tt see... And I felt that it was unreastnable - tt die at the age tf 22. I ordered you to go. You told us about the Three Musketeers. "One for all and all for one." How are you? Can you walk? Good! We'll take J?rv. And Nordstr?m. Switch! How are you, Lindblad? - Just a flesh wound. I can help you. Klockars! Check if they need help. - Yes, sir! Give him water. Let's go. Does anyone know their blood type? Mine's O. - Good. You'll donate blood. How are you, Lindblad? Nothing serious? No, sir. I'll be OK soon. - Good. I need men like you. That was fast, boys. Thank you. Sit down. Giving blood is no easy task. I feel dizzy. - How is J?rv? He came to after three bottles of plasma. And a hefty dose of my blood. You can be proud, corporal. Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you for everything. You'll make it. I spent a ltng time at the htspital. The wtund didn't heal and had tt be tperated tn many times. St G?ran's hospital, May 1944 You got mail. From my regiment commander. - Nice. He still remembers me. It's been nine months already. How are you feeling? - OK. "A stldier's hand, fttt and life can be taken. " "May Ltrd prttect this land, that is all I want. " "Thus sang a stldier begging ftr mtney in Ensign St?l." "He didn't feel strry ftr his ltst leg. " "Our ctuntry is what mattered the mtst. " "Ytu have that same cturage. Ytu've shtwn it in spades. " "Ytur wtrk is dtne, ytur duty fulfilled. " "I am prtud tf ytu." "Remember tt write tt us." "If ytu need stmething, we'll dt tur best tt help ytu. " "Ytur ctmrade, Lieutenant Ctltnel Alpt Marttinen. " Soon you'll walk with a prosthetic limb. We'll transfer you to Salsta castle. Baroness Wera von Essen has set up a convalescence home - for Finnish soldiers. Reconnaissance division June 7th, 1944, Stockholm I'd like to speak to Engineer Lieutenant Nils-Erik Stenb?ck. Stenb?ck. Hi, Nils-Erik. It's Curt Wennberg. HQ's reconnaissance division, Mikkeli How are you? - I'll speak candidly. What the devil are you doing? The Russkies have 24 divisitns ready ftr attack. Twenty-four? Cannons and tanks side by side. And more motorised units are coming. The attack may start at anytime - and ytu're ntt even practising! Unbelievable. I just wanted to warn you. Not exactly good news, Curt. But thanks. A lot. Ketonen, dammit! Even the Swedes know the Russians are launching a major offensive. Looks like it. They've concentrated more troops than we anticipated. I wrote in the report that a major offensive may start any day. We'll see if the big boys like it. You can't do that. You know General Airo's orders. Mannerheim is not to be unnerved. - It doesn't change the facts. Sounds horrible. It's the real deal in Karelia now. Believe me, boys. We won't get old here. 61 is heading west soon. You almost hope for it. What the hell are we doing here if Helsinki is under threat? Vyborg fell suddenly on June 20th which caused a threat. If Russkies had crtssed the strait they wtuld've gttten tt Helsinki. Instead they stopped at Vyborg to celebrate their victory. IR 61 was ordered to assume command of Tienhaara. Marttinen understttd what was at stake. He ttld his men tver and tver again - that Tienhaara was Finland's ltck. And he was determined tt keep it ltcked. We're getting close. We'll arrive in about thirty minutes. The company will march to Tienhaara. Expect artillery and aerial attacks. The boys shouldn't march in too tight a formation. Look at this map. Salsta castle. June 10th, 1944 You're very kind, baroness. - You've deserved your coffee. Go ahead. Cream and sugar? No, thanks. Here is the news. The Stviet Unitn has launched a majtr tffensive in Karelia. The Finnish ptsts were heavily btmbarded yesterday. And the btmbardment intensified this mtrning. Stviet ftrces have brtken thrtugh Finnish defences - and ftrced the Finns tt withdraw. In Ntrmandy, the Allied ftrces have strengthened... It's time for me to go back. Are you going to the front with that leg? It hasn't even healed properly. Perhaps. And it's driving me crazy! My place is at the front. Excuse me... Don't think I'm not grateful to you and Sweden. - Of course not. Karelian peninsula, June 22nd, 1944 Stop! Where's your commander? Where's your commander? The battalion remains at their posts! If you leave, I'll court-martial you! At least try! Another group will relieve you soon. Major Eino Penttil?, Lieutenant Colonel. Alpo Marttinen, commander of IR 61. I've defended Kivisillansalmi with two short handed battalions. The Russkies tried to come across an hour ago. About a company, but they were beaten. You came at the last minute. We've fought for two weeks against their point of offensive. This group is near the end. - OK. I understand. IR 61 will relieve you at 1500 hours. Let your troops rest and make it combat ready. - Yes, sir. The furniture is in place, good! Gentlemen, the regiment position is this: Major Holmberg's 1st battalion will be in command on the left - from Rapattila to Kivisilta. Detached Battalion 27 will be to your left. I'll move my command post to the front. Is the Major afraid? You'll position the 3rd battalion to Major Holmberg's right side. To your right side are the Estonian volunteers, IR 200. Captain Renvall's 2nd battalion will be reserves at the rear. Position the machine guns at the waterside. The artillery fire will be murderous. Every man has to dig himself a foxhole. Sweat spares blood. Tell that to your men. I know that they're tired and hungry after the march - but the situation is as it is. Questions? The first companies arrive shortly. Go! Wessberg. Tell the artillery commander to come here. Co-operation with the artillery - communications and maintenance must be improved. Understood, sir. What the hell? They're going the wrong way. Shut up, boys! Don't mind us. Who knows what hell they've been through. Let's get to it. Like Marttinen said, sweat spares blood. You must be able to shoot to those bridges. Lieutenant Colonel. Major Heikki Huttunen, commander of 1st artillery battalion of FAR 8. Rauramo assigned me to be your artillery commander. Marttinen. - Lieutenant Sipil?inen. Sit down. How is Colonel Rauramo going to support us? FAR 8 commands more than three artillery battalions. Over 70 cannons can be concentrated to assist you. Over 50 % of them are at your personal disposal. The material is in place. Communications are being built and fire plans developed. Sounds good. Thanks, Major. Thank you. Seventy... Good. Sir! - Any casualties? Five killed and 58 wounded. OK. How's your munitions? The times are hard but Marttinen has it under control. We'll be OK. What is it, Harry? Can't you get any sleep? - No. Are you thinking of our comrades? It's horrible to lie here, I should be there with them. We'll come to get you. Are there any more wounded? - Are you nuts? Get down! Oh, hell! Who's going to take care of them now? Unis. Nystr?m is out of the game. You'll take command of the platoon. I'll take command of the company after Captain Joffs. Major Holmberg says that all 1st company commanders are wounded. Pikulinsky, Holmstr?m and Hjort. The 11th company was under concentrated artillery fire. Joffs and Nystr?m are both out. L?fman assumed command and Unis took over Nystr?m's platoon. They've lost 27 men, only six are left. Wessberg! Contact the Estonian volunteers. If the situation cools, we leave. We're not staying here to die. Here they come! Defense Sorvali! Fire! Defense Linna! Fire! Dammit! All the lines are broken! One to two battalions? I can't make it out. One to two battalions - are attacking over the Sorvali and Linnasaari strait. Right? Contact the division HQ! Give it to me. The cannons are aimed? - Yes. Captain Renvall, Il/IR 61, connect to the artillery office! Captain H?nninen. - Captain Renvall. Russkies attack frtm Linnasaari and Strvali with twt battalitns. Two battalions! I'll take full responsibility and order you to fire! They've had enough for now. But they'll be back! Headquarters, Mikkeli Can Tienhaara hold - if it sounds like this 120 kilometres away? The 3rd battalion commander says - that the Russkies have broken through at Kivisilta. Thank you. You can go back. Wessberg! The Russkies must be beaten! Here's an order for Major Holmberg. How many assault guns will support us? - Two, sir. You two go to Major Holmberg with this order. But on separate routes. Understood? - Yes, sir. Medics! Sir, an order from the commander. Thank you. Listen, boys! "One tr twt platttns have brtken thrtugh at Kivisilta. " "They must be sttpped. Use assault guns in ctunterattack." "An energetic tfficer must lead it tt make it wtrk." "It must be dtne swiftly. Reserves must be used withtut ctmpunctitn." "Marttinen." L?fman, you'll strike back with the 11th company. Our artillery and two assault guns will lay down cover fire. It's OK. Good luck. Thank you, sir. 11th company, follow me! Platoon commanders and group leaders here! To the bridge! At any cost! We could use J?rv now. - No kidding. They're here! Medic! They're not here anymore. My weapon... And L?fman? - He's dead. A call frtm headquarters tt the ctmmander tf IR 61. This is the ctmmander-in-chief. Lieutenant Colonel Marttinen, sir Field Marshal! Do you have the situation under control, Lieutenant Colonel? Tienhaara will hold, sir. Tienhaara will htld... I thank ytu... Ctltnel. Relay my thanks to the regiment. Our ctuntry is saved... ftr ntw. Thank you, sir Field Marshal. Over. Hello. Congratulations, Colonel. The Russkies have had enough for now. But the price was too high. I lost hundreds of men. Five company commanders died today. There are only 38 men left in the 11th company. War is hard. Colonel, I heard you were promoted. Congratulations. Thank you, Lieutenant. But in all honesty I have to say - that this battle was won mainly because of the artillery. Tell that to your regiment. Shouldn't you rest, Colonel? It's quieter now. No. I must go to the front line to thank the men. Marshal's orders. Soldiers! It's been a tough day. We will never see many of our comrades again. And even more were wounded. But I'm very proud of you. Our commander-in-chief Field Marshal Mannerheim - personally asked me to thank you, men of IR 61. Because of you he promoted me to Colonel. No Russkies who came here remained alive. You also, Lieutenant Lillandt, have been promoted. Congratulations, Captain. Remember what I said, boys! Tienhaara is Finland's lock. I rely on you. The Marshal relies on us! Do you think that the troops will hold? - Yes, Colonel. The foxholes are the best place to be. We'll be OK if the artillery is as good as today. If there's enough munitions and bread and other food too. Thanks, Captain. I'll make sure you'll get all you need. We cannot retreat unless there's peace. If we want to save our lives and our nation. What did he want? - Nothing special. He gave a speech to the boys. During the days and weeks in Tienhaara - IR 61 ltst 820 men. But the Finnish ltck and the rtad tt Helsinki remained cltsed. A few weeks after that - Finland's independence was at stake every day. After Tienhaara, the Red Army tried to win the war at Tali-lhantala. The largest battle of the Nordic countries was fought there. Subtitles: Arto Vartiainen Broadcast Text
