Dark Heraclitus Infinity as a spirit of nations and the world may be understood only from a clumsy point of view. We must expose the myths themselves more conclusively. The origin of the most beautiful world is a random pile of garbage. This world, constructed in a uniform manner, for each and every one of us, was created by neither god nor man, but has always existed, exists and will exist forever, an eternally burning flame burning with moderation and extinguishing itself with moderation. Heraclitus came down from the mountain. Thanks to the poignant phrases which the Sibyll's inspired mouth send out to us across the millenia, Heraclitus of Ephesia speaks to us in tears. Reading him brings me to tears. He who possessed the absolute power of speech, he who, though of the same origin as the gods, separated himself from them Dark Heraclitus marched towards happy Greece, his beard full of wisps of straw and of insects. And, with the clarity of thought of early morning, oh, the soul, the soul, the beauty of the world, you are the indestructible one, eternally young, you exist. What thus is death and all human ills? How many shallow words are responsible for these eccentric ideas? At the end of the day, everything is created by desire and all things end in peace. The world's dissonances are like lovers' tiffs. Dispute is inhabited by reconciliation and all that was separated is reunited. There is only one life, burning, eternal. Heraclitus arrived in Ephesia, his town of birth, a Greek city in Asia Minor. All is one, divisible and indivisible. Created and yet to be created, mortal and immortal. Word and eternity. Father and son. God and man. Hidden harmonies surpass the visible harmonies. Men, in their sleep, work together as brothers on the creation of the world. We sink into and do not sink into the same rivers. We are and we are not. The most beautiful monkey is ugly. Compare him to mankind. The master whose oracle is at Delphi neither affirms nor hides anything. He signifies. The sun, big as a man's foot. Salutations Heraclitus, because you exist. The Ephesians have learned that you refused the great Darius' invitation Why don't you answer? - So that you keep talking. The Ephesians would do well to hang themselves all at once, and abandon their city to the children, they who exiled my lover Hermodore, the most precious man of them all, saying: "Let no man among us distinguish himself from the rest, and if one does, let him live elsewhere, among other people." Bye. It's Heraclitus the loudmouth, he who insults the crowd, who speaks in riddles. In Ephesius, the primary occupation of the philosopher is to play jackstones with the children. If it wasn't for Dionysius, for whom they follow the cortege and sing the phallic hymn, they'd commit great sacrilege. Dionysius and the ruler of Hell are one and the same god, who drives them to frenzy. Cry, children, your fathers are no more. Heraclitus left the men, their children and their feast behind. He made for the temple of Artemis. where he will hide his knowledge. Stop! Withdraw yourself. I am the only god in this sanctuary. Heraclitus, full of hate for his origins, retired to the mountains, frowning, dedicating himself to an eternal solitude of earthly perambulation. Man, that brute, had forgotten the holy equivalence of all things. And Greece, supreme beauty, is sinking. In the mountains, closer to god, whose one flaw he was well aware of: his absence. In a humiliating effort to be master of all, the dark one eats plants and green leaves. Lightning drives the universe. Fire judges everything in its path, sweeping it up as it goes. We must therefore pay attention to that which we have in common, in other words, the universal. Since language is universal, common to all. Whereas, although language is common to all. Most men live as if they each possess their own particular way of thinking. These are not my words that you hear, but speech. It is therefore wise to remember that all is one. Man will perhaps escape the tactile fire, but never the intelligible fire. How can he hide from that which never deteriorates? Unity is born from totality, The whole is born of the one. And thus swells up with dropsy. Heraclitus descends towards Ephesius to consult the doctors. Can you change the deluge into a drought? Even when your life's at stake, you speak in riddles. I don't understand you. The surveyor, who has spent many years studying circles, tries to prove that the sun does not exist. He finally raises his eyes. He can't see it any more. Knowledge of mankind is no longer a medical discipline. The surveyor studying his circles is merely a degenerate bastard. Hello. Heraclitus locks himself in a stable and covers himself in mud in the hopes that the water will evaporate in the heat. You know how to ally enthusiasm with inner cold. To me, you're perfect. Oh, my friend, the world appears clearer to me now than it usually does. And more serious. Cover me in mud. That's what I think. I'll have more to say the next time. Adaptation: Moira Tierney
