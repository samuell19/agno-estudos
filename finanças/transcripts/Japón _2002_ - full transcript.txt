Get down, get down... I said get down! My fingers aren't strong enough. One, two... three little holes. I want to go down to the canyon. Do you know the way? I don't, but my father does. I'll tell him and we'll take you. My son tells me you also like pulling the trigger. Yes. I used to come here as a child. Nice place, isn't it? It's good you found us, it's very difficult to go down by foot. Not even cats make it by night! - You're going to Aya? - Yes. - All the way down? - Yes. We'll make it to San Bartolo in no time in the van. You'll stay there for the night. It's half way down the canyon. Tomorrow, you'll walk down to the village. It's very small, but you can't miss it. There's nothing else. So, do you have family in Aya? Then why visit that lost hamlet? If I'm not being indiscreet. Sorry Dad. I'm sorry. Didn't know it was loaded. Be careful! Sorry about that... Bunch of jerks. The devil loads weapons and idiots shoot'em. So... why are you going to Aya? To kill myself. All right. Hop in the van. Who wants some beer? No beer for the Argentinian. - Who shit in his pants? - I didn't! You're gross! What an asshole! You're gonna break it! Are you okay? Watch out... - Come on! - Hurry up with that! Take this, Pablito, you fuckface! What the hell are you doing? Don't hog the beer! Tell your cousin he needs a shower. It smells like shit in here! Forget to wipe your ass? It smells like hell. Have it again, Pablito! Shut up for fuck's sake! We're listening to music! Fucking hell! Goddam pig gave us a hard time. If I'd known I wouldn't have come. You asshole! Good morning, Sir. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, thanks. - Do I still owe you something? - No. As I said: Go down, down, down... Thank you. You eat those birds? Good afternoon. Afternoon. Afternoon. Good afternoon. I'm looking for a place to stay. Metztitlan's the only place with hotels. Who said hotels? I want a place to stay here. That's all. Down there you'll find the Judge. What has he got to do with it? He's the people's representative. - Down this road? - Yes. Thanks. I understand why you'd come to this village for a rest. People like you is just what we want in this place. I don't see why not. Really, not at all. Except that... Not only cause it's my village but you chose... Wait. I'm with somebody! - You've chosen... - I gotta water my tomatoes! ...very humble, simple people... Wait. I'm with somebody! So... I told you to wait, you asshole! So as I was saying... Hurry up, Judge! I don't see why not... This is a nice village, but in any other one... you could be attacked for no reason. So unfortunately... It's very nice here. Not cause it's my village... It's the best village. Not very touristy, but I think it's the best. Seems our friend is gone now. So... we were talking about Senora Ascen. I should tell you that Mr. Vicente's wife... Sabina... is a good friend of Ascen. We can ask Vicente. He's right over there. I don't think there will be any problem. The lady is very poor, I mustn't lie. She's very poor and humble, but everybody cares for her. Her house is rather remote but I don't think... there will be any problem. She will receive you and if you like it maybe you'll stay. My wife's coming right now! She's with some people. I'm the community's representative. I was elected by the people. Now before we go on, I would like you to show me... your ID or some form of identification. Here's your card. Would you like to see mine? Mrs. Sabina is coming! Come here! Someone wants to ask you a question. The man's staying with Ascen. Take him up there! It doesn't have to be with her, but they say she has a room. A barn. If you want I'll take you to her. Please do. Have a pulquefor the climb! Come on, it's very good! Wait here. Good afternoon, Sir. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Sir. Come in, it's very hot. Thanks. Thank you, Senora AsUncion. You're welcome. But I'm not AsUncion. I'm AscEnsion, which refers to Christ ascending into heaven with nobody's help. And AsUncion refers to the Virgin Mary who was taken up by the angels. But don't worry, here everyone calls me Ascen. Don't they, Sabi? But do come in... into the shade. Fancy a little fruit? Thanks. - And you, Sabi? - No, thank you. I'll be back in a second. - Won't you sit down, Senora? - Thanks. I'm fine on my feet. Now tell me, Sir, what do you need? Sabina told me you'd like to stay for a few days in my barn. Yes indeed, Senora. Well, you know... I'm old now and I can't serve you. Besides, I'm developing arthritis. And on 3rd of March my ankles snapped off. Why don't you look... for a better place down in the village? I don't need you to serve me. Besides, I like your house high up here away from the village. But I don't have running water, it must be brought up with the donkey. Wouldn't you mind? No water is fine by me. I won't stay for long. That's fine then. Stay. He may stay, Sabi. Yes, do stay. I'll stay then. Thank you. Very good. Come now, so I can show you my house. This is my kitchen, that's my hut. Come now, come. There's the barn, where I keep my corn and my little animals. Inside is my dead husband's bed, you can sleep there. Excuse me. Here's some tea for you, Sir. Why do you bother, Senora? It's no bother. Come on in. You were praying, right? I don't do that. Not even to the Virgin Mary? Not even. I'll do it for you then. Good night. Good night. Wait! Please knock before coming in. Forgive me. I'll do as you say. Good morning, Sir. - Can I have your cane? - My cane? No. Can I have some paint? Let me by! Can I have some paint? Let me by! Can I have the painting? Thank you. Let's go, Christopher. Good day, Sir. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. It's bitter... Give him more pulque. Give the lady a drink. She's tired from collecting nuts. She'll go home nice and drunk! So it's you... nosey bastard! I saw you coming up and made some tea to cool you down. Didn't know tea served that purpose. It's ice tea! Have a little fruit. Who was that man coming down the trail? I didn't see anybody. If you say you prepared tea when you saw me coming up, you must have seen the man I crossed on the trail. Now I know who you mean. But... he's not from here. Great! Thanks. Did you enjoy your first day? Do you want some? - What is it? - Marijuana. I like one of those drawings a lot. That wasn't the question. Do you recommend it? What? The little herbs. I do indeed. What? Yes, Senora. Please do. Alright. But only to taste. Pull up a chair. Which is the drawing you said you like so much? This one! I must say I love comic books. I even collect them, but only catholic ones. You've seen all my pictures of Jesus. On your altar? And many more hidden away! Who do you like more: the Virgin Mary or God? I didn't know it was a matter of liking. I told you yesterday they're all the same to me. Here women prefer Jesus... and men love the Virgin Mary of Guadalupe. I had a nephew in jail... and I used to bring him presents. I gave him the Virgin Mary's holy image, but they took it from him... and thrashed him... 'cause he kept masturbating on her. I'm glad you saw the note to come to lunch. I thought you were gone for good. Do you remember the man... you crossed yesterday while coming up this way? Let's forget about that. They want to take away the barn where you sleep. What are you on about, Senora? The man you crossed is my nephew Juan Luis. He was in jail for many years. He's the one I used to bring presents to. He's just come out. And since he inherited... his grandfather's house, he wants to take it away. Where will I keep the corn? Without the barn, my hut will never resist the April winds! I'll make you some of the coffee Sabi gave us. I don't remember where the coffee pot is. I found it. All covered with dust. Poor aunt, she's so dumb. We're gonna get all her stones, right dad? Listen, brat! I won't rest until every single stone is in San Bartolo. But they're ours, aren't they? Shut up! Don't tell me the lady's been thrashing you! My god! You're hurt. Come, take a seat. Easy now. I'll get you some medicine. Can I have your newspaper? Here's the healing medicine. See what young girls are up to nowadays! It's done. Try not to touch the wound. Can you get me another mezcal? Get me more pulque, son! Juan Lopez Perez, at your service. I'm the judge's deputy. Congratulations! Thank you. Who's gonna sing us another song? Come on... Give her a hug, man! Is the pulque alright, Sir? It's very good. Vicente, what are the lady's nephew's plans regarding her house? You know who I mean, that fatso with the dumb gringo cap. Juan Luis. You're drunk! Juan Luis from San Bartolo? If I'd known I wouldn't have asked, shithead! I'm sorry, Senator. I'm quite pissed off. But not with you. San Bartolo is the village in the middle of the canyon? Yes. And Juan Luis works with the butcher? Yes. Senora. They're taking the house tomorrow. Senora, you're being conned. In the early afternoon. That man has no right to this house. How long have you lived here? It was his grandfather's. How many years have you lived in this house? Only about 40. Then it's yours, no one can take it from you. Juan Luis won't take my house, he just wants the stones. He needs them more than I do. I don't mind. What do you mean you don't mind! You said your hut wouldn't resist the April winds without the barn! I'm not a greedy person. Why are you crying then? Because I know what I want. You haven't a clue of what you want. Only yesterday I heard Juan Luis' sons mocking you. Shut up, please. I'm doing laundry. Shall I wash your clothes? Good afternoon, Senora. Good afternoon, Fernando. Just a little favour, would you undo my shoelaces? My daughter is up the hill, looking after her aunt's sheep. They asked for her help 'cause there's a lot to do. I never deny my daughter's services. I lend her. You might see her up there, near your house. Yes, Fernando. I might. Thanks. Have a good day. See you later, God willing. Senora! Senora, please excuse my harshness this morning. Oh Sir! I know you're only trying to help. Have you seen the sunset, Ascen? The best things in life can't be bought, right? I really couldn't say, but it's great you found my blouse. It was a present from Sabi. Sure, sure. Ascen, I want to make you a proposal... to explain something to you. Fine, but first tell me why you came to this place. Alright. To be calm. Cause there's a lot of trouble in the city? Yeah. But it isn't just that. Much serenity is necessary to leave behind the things we're used to and don't really like anymore. We must learn to dispose of what's useless. But it's better to fix things than throw them out. Sure, but certain things can't be fixed. Disposing of them is better than clinging to them out of habit. I think I understand, Sir. But you know, Sir... even though I don't like my sick, old arms, I wouldn't chop them off. Sure, I get you. By the way, what was it you wanted to tell me? Yes, the proposal. Listen, I'd like you to hear some music and then I'll tell you. Ascen... Senora... Is it almost over? I want to tell you what it's about. Let me listen a little more. Is it over? Tell me now what you wanted to tell me. Take off the earphones. Remember I told you how I need a lot of... serenity in order to make a decision? Sure, all about disposing of things. More or less. I know you're an elderly person from a remote canyon... and this might sound a bit strange. But in fact... it's totally normal if you think for a while. Tell me now what you have to say! Forgive me, but I don't follow you. Don't worry. While searching for that serenity, other emotions came up, other instincts. What I would like is to have intercourse with you. There's more to it than that, but that's what it is. I'd like to if you'd like to. - Free intercourse? - Pardon? You tell me. Well... sexual intercourse. It's important for me now. But don't you see I'm very old? I don't mind. Weren't you in a hurry to leave? I will go tomorrow for good. But first I need this. So you want to fornicate me right now? It doesn't have to be right now. Before the end of tomorrow? That's fine. Thank you, senora. I'd like it to be tomorrow, OK? Whenever you like. Good night. Good night. Peace be with you. Peace be with you. Lie down, Senora. Come closer. Now turn around, please. May I keep touching you like this? You must come closer. Now turn around. You must lift yourself up. Come closer. A bit more. Fine. Now turn around. Put your knee here. Lift that up. Your other knee here. Do lift up. Lift up! Now get on your knees. On your knees. On your knees! As if... fine. Further back now. Better if you turn around. What's going on? How dare you take the lady's house from her? You fucking bunch of cowards! How could you leave her like that? Shut up, Sir! What's going on here? Don't shout here! Get him out of here, Senora! Go back to where you belong, foreigner! Get out of here! And calm down! Silence! You shouldn't have hurt him, now he's crippled. Back to where he belongs! Come on, get to work! And sweat! Pull hard now! Here's some more pulque. Thanks, young man! You're falling asleep. Who's gonna get us the drinks? They don't give us much. The people from... from the film. Shut up. You shut up, dumb ass. Have some tea, Sir. It's hot. Drink up! Thanks. I'm pretty drunk now! No thanks. You? Have some tea. I'm very grateful... ...for everything. A little drink for you. Tomorrow we'll have pulque. - Is it good? - It's good. Cheers. Thank you, and God bless you. You just gave me some, Aunt Ascen. I've had enough. Thanks a lot. You're neglecting me. Some tea? You're neglecting me. Sing "Wedding Ring" for us. Hold on. Easy. Go on, it's good! Don't you like it? It's too strong! Stop, or you'll be drunk! Your wife won't love you anymore. Is she still waiting for you? You'll go home to an empty house! Sing us a song now. "Wedding Ring". Just like a mariachi. - I'll sing along. - Fine. You start. Wedding ring, which I put on your finger... I better leave now! She must leave now! Wedding ring... our love's chain... He's really plastered. His wife will give him shit. You are my life... You are my destiny... And my tenderness... Is worth my honour. Wedding ring... Come on, man! We're singing along. Sing along, you too! All you do is drink. Don't cry. I shed my tears... because I know, and I can... sing them to you. Sing! I carved your name on the maguey's bark... together side by side... two hearts together... you know that my heart... is so big. And I'm proud... from the bottom of my heart. Now you say you don't care... because you've been told... the story of my love. And now you know... that I'm at peace... because you wanted... to be my sweetheart. Lift! Turn around. You forgot this stone, dear. Thanks, aunt. Gasparin! Put this stone where it belongs, you swine! Put it on the truck. Aunt, warm up some tacos. There's still plenty of work to be done. There's a lot to do! Please, aunt. Yes, Juan. She's goddam crazy, my aunt. What now, son? The truck's full, we'll need two trips. Doesn't matter. I've paid and it's only gonna be one trip! It's a lot of weight! Do as I tell you. I'm paying for all of this. Go! I'm fucking plastered. Work'll be a bitch tomorrow. You worked damn well, aunt. Ascen! I only took it for the trip down. Sure... It's cold. I'll be back in a jiffy. Pardon the inconvenience. Start it up, Marcos. Hold on... It's just a fucking cat. Now you can start it up! Goodbye, aunt! Wait! Wait for her!
