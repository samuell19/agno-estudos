♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Welcome, everyone. I'm Kirk Cameron, and we are here, we are at Revive Us. We are gathered together as a family all across the nation. I'm here in downtown Chicago at the Harvest Bible Chapel Cathedral and we're part of a giant family meeting. You're in theaters all across the country. And I feel like a kid on Christmas morning. I can't wait to go into this beautiful, historic church and show you what's inside. I know that the next 90 minutes is going to be us standing on holy ground together, and so I thought it was most appropriate for me to ask my pastor Rex Holt if he would lead us in a prayer of blessing before we get started. Rex? Will you pray with us? Yes. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you because you're the God from whom all blessings flow. -Mmm, yes, Lord. -We declare with David, "I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise will continually be in my mouth." -Yes, Lord. -"My soul will make her boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear of it and be glad. Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together. And Father, we cry out with David, the psalmist, will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? Show us your unfailing love and grant us your salvation. And Father, we ask you tonight, this evening, to rend the heavens, to rip open Heaven and pour out your grace upon this land. -Yes, Father. -We cry out to you, Lord, for your unfailing love, for your great peace, and for the blessings of revival. We love you, Father. We praise you, Son. We welcome you, Holy Spirit. In your blessed name we pray, amen. Amen. Amen! All right, you ready? Let's go inside. ♪♪♪ We're so much higher. That's right. Come on, sing it. That's right. Oh, it never stops. Yeah, come on. This I know! Come on, sing it! All over the country tonight. Oh, it's true. Oh, it just keeps going. It never stops. On and on and on! ♪ Yes, I know. ♪ Yes, I know, Yes, I know. ♪ ♪ Oh, I've tasted, I've seen it. ♪ ♪ Oh, there's nothing, no, nothing like it. ♪ ♪ Oh, I've tasted, I've seen it. ♪ ♪ There's nothing like, nothing like your love. ♪♪♪ Oh, nothing like it.

You can be seated. We're going to do something very special tonight. In just a moment, if you are serving in our military, if you are a member of the Armed Forces either currently or in the past as a veteran, in just a moment, I'm going to ask you to please stand. Not just yet, but in a moment. We want to acknowledge and we want to recognize and honor you. If you are serving in our military and including first responders, our heroic police officers, fire fighters, EMTs, and paramedics. If that is you, you know who you are, in theaters all across the country and in this church, but especially across the nation in our movie theaters, right now would you please stand? Let them know how much you appreciate them. [applause] Thank you for your service. [applause] Thank you for your service to our families and to our country. Would you remain standing? And now would you all rise as our nation's colors are presented by the University of Illinois at Chicago's ROTC? Forward, march. [drum roll] [drum roll] [drum roll] Detail, halt. And now would you join me, place your right hand over your heart and pledge your allegiance to the United States of America. "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." Right, face. Forward, march. [applause] You may be seated. Well, it's here. I am so excited. The National Family Meeting is in session. You are part of the family; I am so excited that you're here. If you could feel, my heart is literally thumping and pounding in my chest with excitement that we are here across the nation together as a family because when our family gets together, the family of faith and the Spirit is moving, we are unstoppable. -Amen. -We want God to revive us as a nation. We all know this. We're talking about it at all of our dinner tables. We want him to tear open the heavens, we want him to come down, we want God's will to be done and his kingdom to come and be with us on earth just as it is in heaven. Many of you have brought your families to Revive Us and I want you to meet my family. I've got a picture I want to put up on the screen right now, and this is my family. These are the ones that I would just give anything for. I love them with all my heart. On the left there of your screen is Luke, and Luke is just an amazing young man. I'd probably describe him as a cross between Si Robertson and Steph Curry. I don't know how he makes that little combo, but he lives in the middle there somehow and he just rocks it. Bella is next to Luke and that's my beautiful little girl who's all grown up now, and Bella loves to sing. She's gonna be joining us and leading us in worship in just a little while. I want you to meet Olivia. Olivia is my wife's mini me. If you had a shrinker gun and you could just zap my wife she would turn into a little miniature version and that is Olivia. She can do anything; she's amazing. I think one day she's gonna grow up and run the world. I know she could do it. James, he is our Joy Boy. We've always called him that. Sometimes I feel like I'm raising a mini Mike Seaver when I look at him. It's a little scary, I have to tell you. And then on my left there is Ana. Ana is a beautiful young lady. She can do anything. She gets it all done. She wants to grow up and be a nurse one day. And Jack, he is our genius, we call him our gentle giant. I want you to meet them because I love them and this is why we're doing this. This is, this is for our children. This is for our family and the future that we leave for them, and our conversations revolve around what can we do? So, I decided to go to people smarter than me, wiser than me, people of deep faith and humility and ask them at a time like this how can we be a part of the solution? And so I talked to people like Francis Chan, heroes like Dr. Ben Carson, Dr. James MacDonald, Jennifer Rothschild, Eric Metaxas - people that have solutions. And I've always thought to myself, if only I could get these backroom conversations out into the open, I don't see the media providing opportunities for you to hear what I'm hearing that's refreshing my spirit, reviving my heart, giving me optimism, hope, and a new perspective. And so I brought them together tonight so that we can have this meeting, and we can hear it, and we can discuss it, and we can interact with one another and be part of revival in our nation. So, the first friend that I'm going to ask to join me is Dr. Ben Carson. Would you welcome him? [applause] Dr. Carson is not only a brilliant neurosurgeon, he is a man of deep faith in God. He loves Jesus and I trust him. And he's faced impossible situations in the operating room where people have said there's no hope, against all odds this cannot work. And he, through prayer and great skill, has managed to accomplish things with teams of people that are considered medical miracles. And I couldn't think of anyone better to ask to diagnose for us the health of America today. Dr. Carson, if America were your patient, how would you diagnose her health? What do the vital signs tell you? I would say America is in critical condition but it is not something that cannot be salvaged, but it needs attention now. And, you know, there are certain diseases that if you recognize and you intervene at the appropriate time, you can actually restore the patient to full health and that's what we're looking at right now in our country. You know, this country was founded on Judeo-Christian values and principles. We are the only country in the world where we feel that our rights come from God. Other countries think that they come from the government or from the monarch, or whoever is in charge. Our Declaration of Independence says we have certain unalienable rights given to us by our Creator, a.k.a. God. That means that we know the difference between right and wrong. We have actual principles that guide the way that we have created our laws and our statutes. And the question is will we return to those things, or will we allow them to vanish for the sake of political correctness? Will we actually throw the Word of God away even though every coin in our pocket and every bill in our wallet says, "In God We Trust?" Even though when we say the pledge, we say. "We're one nation under God?" And yet we have a time when in the public square we're saying you're not supposed to talk about God in public. Obviously, this was never the intention of our founders and interestingly enough there is nothing in the Constitution about the separation of church and state. A lot of people think that's in the Constitution, it is not. That was a Supreme Court judgment later on. And it wasn't separation of God and state. It didn't mean that you couldn't live according to your faith, it just meant the government was not to be controlled by religion and religion - and vice versa. And if we understand that, then we begin to treat people the right way. We start thinking about liberty and justice for all instead of liberty and justice for this group at the expense of this group. And, you know, once we get away from that and we start thinking the way that the original intent was, we will very rapidly return to our healthy status. What are some of the vital signs that tell you America is in trouble? Well, one of the vital signs is our economic health. We are, at this stage of the game, approaching 20 trillion dollars in national debt. I mean, that's a number that we can all say, but can anybody really even comprehend what that means? -It's a huge number. -I mean, a billion is a thousand million, just to put that in perspective, and a trillion is a thousand billion. If we tried to pay that back. Let's say all of the sudden we said we're smart again; we're going to pay our debt back at a rate of one billion dollars a week. It would take us 400 years. So, we've got to do better than that. That's a major sign. Another sign is the division. Jesus himself said, "A house divided against itself cannot stand." Abraham Lincoln later echoed that. It is absolutely 100% true and yet we see people trying to divide us on the basis of race, gender, religion, economics, age - virtually everything. And if we're all fighting each other then how will we stand against outside enemies? Historically, when you look at societies who fall, very frequently they lose their patriotism, they lose their unity, they lose their strength and it makes them easy victims. What are the chances of her recovery? If she's in ICU, what are the chances, do you think, of her pulling through? I think the chances are actually pretty substantial if, interestingly enough, "If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and heal their land." 2 Chronicles 7:14. That is the solution. We simply need to stop trying to be like everybody else and recognize that God put this country here for a unique purpose. Let's not try to be anybody else. We're not anybody else. This is an amazing country. It went from nowhere to the pinnacle of the world in unbelievable time, and to a much higher pinnacle than anybody else reached and it was because of those values and principles that laid the foundation for our nation. What if America does not recover? What if we lose her? There are other countries in the world and as Christians, we understand that the kingdom of God is not dependent upon America, it's not synonymous with this geopolitical nation. -Yes. -What are the consequences if we lose her? But God has blessed our nation tremendously because we acknowledged him. And if we throw him out, there is no question that we will decline precipitously and the consequences to the world will be substantial. Anybody who knows world history recognizes what the world was like before the United States was on the scene. You know, tyrants pillaging other countries and just killing, hundreds of millions of people being slaughtered. and I have no doubt that that will be the case again. So, you know, we're not only working for ourselves, we're working for the world. And remember, this country is the child of every other nation, so we have a responsibility to the other nations of the world. We don't live only for ourselves. And we must recognize that when Jesus died, he died for everybody, not just for the people in the United States. -That's right. -And we have to make that manifest in the way that we do things, and the way that we lead, and the way that we treat other people. I love that. It's sobering, in critical condition, but there is great reason for hope. And even more reason for hope, if the people in this room tonight and the people who are listening all across America recognize that every single one of us has a sphere of influence and we need to talk to those people and we need to help them to understand the role that we play. You know, in the last election, 25 million Evangelicals who are registered to vote did not vote. They sat on their hands. And as a result of that, you just have to recognize that we are a huge interest group with the ability to direct the nation. -Yes. -So we don't have to be victims and sit back and say what others are doing to us. But what we have to do is stand up because freedom is not free; you have to fight for it every day. And you have to recognize that there are those, particularly secular progressives who say, "I don't care what anybody else thinks as long as they sit down and shut up." We need to stand up and shout out. -Yes. [applause] I want to take you now to a specialist. I'm calling him a specialist. Another friend who's named Eric Metaxas and he specializes in analyzing cultures in history that have been deeply troubled in the past, like Nazi Germany, and highlighting heroes that have brought fantastic solutions to bear by bringing the truth to the forefront and doing it very courageously, like Dietrich Bonhoeffer during those years of Nazi Germany. Also William Wilberforce when England was overrun with slavery. I met with him in what I'm calling the most historic building in America, Independence Hall in Philadelphia. This is the room where America was created and our founding fathers, we're talking George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, signed the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, and asked him to get even more specific about where the area of infection is. Let's go there now. [drum cadence] This is where it all started. This is where America was born. -This is the maternity ward. -This is it. This is the birthing room where she was born. Why is that? What's in here that...? It was right here literally in this room that the Declaration of Independence and something I like to call the Constitution happened here. We're not making this up. -That's the birth certificate for the nation. -It is, it is absolutely where the nation was created, in this room. Stunning to think that is the exact chair that George Washington sat in. It's not a replica. It-it gives me chills, honestly. This is it. These are the 13 tables where the 13 different colonies were represented, from the north to the south. There's even - what's the cane over there, the walking stick? That cane literally belonged to Thomas Jefferson. It has "TJ" inscribed on it. They know for a fact that it belonged to him. Enough of the geeking out on history. -Yeah. -We want to understand why did this, this new nation, this county that was birthed, the United States was so strong and so healthy, she's growing so fast, she's become sick. If you could diagnose what it is that went wrong, what is it? -It's actually shockingly simple. According to the founders, and I mean every one of the founders, Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, every one of them, they understood that virtue and faith, faith, real faith, true religion, free religion, was at the heart of the success of the American experiment. You could not have the kind of liberty they were talking about, the kind of self-government where people govern themselves, you could not have it, it would not work unless the people were basically a virtuous people, the people were people of faith. It doesn't mean it's forced faith, it's totally free. You don't have to have faith, but they said if basically the American people are not a virtuous, religious people, this cannot work. -Why not? -And it - well, okay. Os Guinness, my dear friend, wrote about something called, "The Golden Triangle Of Freedom," and it's simply this: the first part of the triangle is freedom, self-government requires virtue. You cannot govern yourself unless you are yourself virtuous. If somebody has to force you to do the right thing, you are being governed from above, from without; you need a tyrant, a king, a strongman, whatever it is, a big bureaucracy. If you want to govern yourself, if you want to be truly free, you have to have some virtue. And the people have to have enough virtue to do the right thing, basically, on their own. They had a history of English law, they had a history of Christian faith. But more importantly, George Whitfield, the evangelist had been preaching through most of the 18th century, from 1738 until 1770. Revival was breaking out. The Great Awakening was breaking out all across the 13 colonies. Ben Franklin was friends with Whitfield and he saw that when revival breaks out, people - crime goes down, drunkenness goes down, self-government goes up, virtue goes up. And he understood this link that if religion and faith are thriving and free, self-government absolutely thrives. All the founders understood this so the golden triangle of freedom is faith, freedom requires virtue, virtue requires faith, and then faith in turn requires freedom because the faith must be free. It cannot be coerced by the government, and the founders said that unless religion is free, religion will not flourish and if religion doesn't flourish, freedom cannot flourish. Hmm. You also talk about in your book Alex de Tocqueville. He came over from France after the Revolution and said, what is it that makes America thrive? We're not thriving in the system we've created. No. Freedom and faith help each other. They work together. It was something he couldn't even conceive of, so when he saw it, he said America is great because America is good. In other words, what makes America great is that the people are full of faith, full of virtue. Maybe not every single person, but by and large, it's what makes freedom work. All of the founders said without that, the whole thing falls apart. I think we've been going on fumes for 40 or 50 years and we're in trouble. And when de Tocqueville came over he said, "I looked for the source of America's greatness and I looked everywhere." It was his observation clearly that it was in the churches and in these little organizations that sprung out of people's faith and virtue. There was something he saw in America along those lines which he saw none of in France. And that phrase I like is he says, "It wasn't until I went into the churches and saw their pulpits aflame with righteousness that I discovered what was the source of America's greatness." Tons of people saw this. I mean, you could say every one of the founders saw this. Franklin, who was not himself a theologically orthodox Christian, he saw this. He wanted to promote this. He was the one that called for prayer in this room. He said that we need to pray. We need to start every morning with prayer. Benjamin Franklin said that in this room. Everybody in this room understood the role of faith as central, utterly central, utterly vital to the health of self-government. If, if we were to choose one of the three points of the triangle, liberty, self-government and freedom, virtue, doing the right thing, or true religion, can we point to one of them today and say that's the one that's being attacked most or is it all three or...? Well, it, it's all three because they're all totally connected, but if you really want to say what is the one that is mostly overtly being attacked? Faith. There's no doubt. We have forgotten that without faith, America cannot be America. Without people of faith - most, most people think that the Bible supported slavery or whatever. That is absolutely crazy. There were crazy people who would say that, but by and large, all of the abolitionists got their ideas that slavery is bad from the Bible. They were Bible thumpers. All through our history it has been faith, faith, faith, faith that caused us to do the right thing. It caused us to abolish the Jim Crow laws and to have the civil rights movement. Faith has been at the center. And again, in the last 50 years or so, it's become attacked to the point where we have lost this vital piece. Without this piece, none of this works. ♪♪♪ [applause] All right, we've, we've been to the doctor. We've heard the word, "critical condition," but that there's hope. We've gone to a specialist, I'm calling Eric, who's diagnosed for us the specific part of the body that is infected and that's true religion. He's talking about true faith. Now I want to introduce you and spend a few minutes with two physicians of the soul. Dr. James MacDonald, Francis Chan. These guys are brilliant, they study the Bible, they understand what true religion is. They've taught it to me. They write books, they're pastors and they've influenced the way that I raise my kids. And so I am honored that they're here with us tonight. James, what is true religion, genuine faith and how do you get it? Well, that's a great question and, of course, I think a big part of this question that you're asking is like most questions, we need to let the Word of God speak. So, if the Bible's answered the question we don't need to keep asking it, do we? And James 1, I can start in verse 26 says that, "If anyone thinks he's religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God..." Now that should have us leaning forward, or we're going to find out, right now we're going to find out what it is. Here it is. "Pure and undefiled religion before God is this: to visit the orphans and the widows in their affliction." Let's call that category compassion for those who in any way have less than me. That's on God's heart, it has to be on my heart. If it's not on my heart, that's not true religion and Francis is so exemplary in that regard. He'll speak about that I'm sure in a moment. Let me focus on the second thing. "That pure and undefiled religion before God is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world." Now the world in the Bible means one of three things. Sometimes it means the planet, you know, planet Earth. Sometimes it means the people, "For God so loved the world." That's not the planet, that's the people. And sometimes it means the world system, the culture, the way of thinking. The third thing is in mind here. We want to keep ourselves as believers, true undefiled religion is keeping itself unstained by the world. So the mark of the world - selfishness, me first, you know, you only come around once, get everything you can, live for the moment, you know, all of this, that is the world. And if that is in me and in my thinking, I'm stained by the world. Holiness is the absence of that, the differentness, the set apartness. And, you know, I think sometimes we've reacted so much to legalism that we've almost forgotten that God has prescribed a way for his people to live. And the Biblical term is holiness. And God says, "Be holy for I am holy." And, of course, that capacity is not in ourselves. We believe very strongly that Jesus Christ is not only the "way" to pure religion but that he is also the means of it. That the Christian life isn't just me loving and following Jesus, but it's actually Jesus living his life through me. And I think about this building that we're in and this is a beautiful big cathedral built in 1860. It was given to our church. It's an incredible story, but what's interesting is is that from the time that it was founded, the different organizations that were in here did not ever, ever preach the Word of God. As far as we know, that doesn't matter to mention the names of it, but I don't want it to be a distraction. I'll just say that it is a very religious place but the Word of God was not open, the son of God was not adored, the Holy Spirit was not moving, lives were not being changed. And eventually it got closed down and shut down and it got given to us and God's doing some wonderful things here now. But where people are humble and low, we want to put ourselves down low. So many Christians are angry at America because it's hurting their comfort. We're not supposed to be angry at anyone. Who are we to be angry about anything? We love God and we want to share with others what we have found in Christ. I think that's pure and undefiled religion before God. -That's awesome. How about a second opinion? [laughter] Yeah, I mean, I agree with everything you just said and I would just add to it though sometimes we can jump to the action of do this, do this, do this without the core of it, which is being known by God. You know, one of the scariest passages to me is Matthew 7 where he says, "Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord is going to enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father." And then he says many on that day, many are going to say, "But Lord, didn't we cast out demons?" Didn't we do this, didn't we do this? And he's gonna say "Depart from me, I never knew you." And so at the core is not like religion as far as outward doing this, this and this, it's about a knowing of him. And not knowing about him, you know. I mean, that's a scary passage, "I never knew you." It's like, since we're in Chicago, you could name every stat of Michael Jordan, where he was born, how many points he scored in this game, but if you knocked on his door he's probably not gonna let you in, you know, right? [laughter] Why? "I don't know you." And at the core is, is this incredible thought that I can know the Creator and be known by him. He can forgive me and when he does that, he actually enters into me and enables me to do all of these things. [applause] So...how do you get true religion? Someone's watching this and they're saying, "I understand. I want to have a heart of compassion. I don't want to be stained and marked by selfishness and ego and pride. How do I get that? Where is it?" -Yeah. The Bible, again, we'll just let the Bible speak, but it talks about being born again. And I think of this passage in 1 John 3 verse 9 where it says, "No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him and he cannot keep on sinning because he's been born of God." So it's this idea of this - when God enters into you, it's like he abides with you. That's what he wants. "I want to abide with you. I want to be in you." It says his seed actually dwells in you to the point where you can't keep on sinning. You know, you used to be able to, but now it's like you don't even enjoy it. It's like, ahh, I feel so much guilt, I - this is not the way God made me. And the way we get there is we have to humble ourselves, like Dr. Carson said earlier. "If my people will humble themselves and seek my face." We have to come to a point where I have to look at God and go, "God, I get it. I broke so many of your commands." But what the Bible teaches is that rather than punishing me, he showed more love than anyone will ever show me. He had his son come down, take the form of a man nailed to a cross and he was paying for everything I did. You know, the Bible says if I believe that with all my heart, if I can confess him as Lord and say, "I want you as my master," a God who will do that for me, forgive me of everything, I want you. He says well, I'll enter into you. My seed will actually come into you and change - he does everything. It's about him and him reaching down to us. And that's why, you know, you talk about true religion, but later on in 1 John 3, I love this, it says, "By this we know love. that he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. If anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?" See again, it goes back to wait a second, we know love because Jesus died for us and then he put his seed in us, so if we see people hurting and we do nothing, he goes, "How could God be abiding in you?" That doesn't make sense. You're a child of God now. It becomes natural to love. It becomes, you know, supernatural. I was in Africa last week holding a baby that was gonna die in a couple of days. I didn't have to - it wasn't like, ah, I better sacrifice. No, everything in me was like, I want to do something for her. I'm meeting girls who are sold into slavery when they're six, seven years old. Everything in me is like, "I'm gonna rescue them." Why? Because that's the heart of God. That's the nature he gives us. But he's always the hero. It's like he did it all. He saved us, he forgave us, and then he puts his spirit in us that enables us to live this way. [applause] Amen. [applause] So when true religion that you speak of is flourishing in the life of a person, when it's flourishing in the life of a family, in the life of a community and a nation, what does that look like? Because there's plenty of people who say, "Get rid of God, get rid of religion. We don't need that. We'd be better off without it." When it flourishes, what happens? Well, I love this tag-team preaching with Francis here. I think that he just said it and I would be happy to say it again. [laughter] It, it - faith, faith is internal. It is secret, it is unseen. And you cannot tell to look - and this is good to know - you cannot tell to look at a person visually. You don't know if they were born again. You don't know if they know Jesus. You don't have any idea. And furthermore, we're not better than people who don't know the Lord. We have a righteousness that is not our own. We have the righteousness of Christ through faith in him. But Christians, we act like we're righteous and then we look around at everyone, you're not righteous. I don't think you're very righteous. Man, I'm real righteous over here. [laughter] And that is so destructive. It is the actual antithesis of what Christianity is all about. And we've just been exhorted that the test of the thing that is unseen, the proof of the thing that is unseen is the heart toward others. You know, Paul said that, "Let each esteem others as better than themselves." Philippians 3. I want you to just think for a minute. How's that going? Everyone is better than me. You are better than me. You are better than me. All of you are better than me. You're smarter than me and you're more important than me and your feelings matter more than my feelings matter. And I don't want to be known and I don't want to be famous. I want Jesus to be known and famous, and I want you to find in him all that I have found. That's what he meant when he said, "He who loses his life for my sake will find it." And we've got to come back to that in the church. We've got to stop with this consumer - I got to church to what I get. What do I get? What am I getting? I heard this guy, I got something here, I got something here, I got something here. The essence of Christianity is not a getting thing. It's not a getting thing. Everyone lift up your voice and say it. Say, "It's not a getting thing." Say it. -It's not a getting thing. -Come on. It's a giving thing. It's a giving thing. If you see your brother in need and you close up your heart of compassion, how does the love of God dwell in you? We've worked pretty hard as a church and we've made a movie called, "The Resurrection of Gavin Stone." It's going to come out in January. And really what that whole thing is about is about what the church can be, you know. The church is supposed to be we're teaching our people that church is a place where we welcome without judgment, where we love without condition, where we forgive without limit. Now if the church really was that we'd be running out of chairs, all right? But people are at church to get something, not at church to give something and to welcome those who need so desperately what we have found in Jesus. And before America will ever be great again, God's people will have to get humble again, and I think there's - I hope that, I pray that there is a lot of humbling going on right now. I know that I feel pretty broken in my heart about where America is at, pretty distressed. I think the reason that we've seen such a great response to the leadership that you've give us is because people are looking for answers and they're wondering where to turn, and who's gonna lead us to something better than what all this has become? You know, I love the scripture, Francis, that says that, "Judgment must begin at the house of God." Instead of throwing out the judgments at everybody else that hasn't figured it out, we should be the most loving person that our neighbor knows. If you've got an alcoholic as a next door neighbor, you should be the most loving person that they know. If you have a gay friend at work and he knows that you're a Christ follower, you should be the most loving person that they know. -That's right. -And, and, we're, you know, love is like relational dynamite, right? 1 Corinthians 13 says, "Love never fails," right? So it never fails, just think about that. It never fails. Love never fails to accomplish God's purposes, ever. Now I've tried judgment, I've tried pressure, I've tried fixing it. How have those things been going for you guys? [laughter] Anytime I've got traction in anything I want to see happen, it's been Jesus Christ loving people through me. And in the days that I have remaining, I want more of that and less of everything else. [applause] Do you have anything to add to that? [laughter] -Not a whole lot, but it's true. Like, the sadness is not just, oh, you know, the country, where it's at. The sadness is the church. -That's right. -Okay? That's, that's, I mean, in 2 Timothy 4, it's like, "Terrible times are coming." Not because the world is gonna be the world, but because the church starts looking so much like the world. I mean, God just, God's not expecting the whole nation to turn. He's looking in this room. He's look at the theaters out there and going, just these pockets of people who want my kingdom down there and live like my kingdom is down there amidst everything. It doesn't matter what's going on. What matters is with us, his body. Are we living the way he wants us to live? [applause] We, we've given you a lot. This is a lot to process. We've heard from the doctor and a specialist and a couple of physicians that have, that have given us the Word of God, which is like a sword that cuts deep into our heart and it exposes our sin, and it points us to our only hope. I want to give you, and myself, a couple of minutes to digest what we have just received. And I want to ask you in theaters all around this country and in this room right here if you would stand as we move into a time of worship. We are going to be led by the Vertical Church Band in a song called, "Exalted Over All." So in theaters across the nation, yes, we're turning your theater into a worship center. Would you please stand together with us all across the nation and worship the Lord together. [applause] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ You are exalted, Lord! We lift you high. [applause] -It's true. Christ is exalted over all. He ascended and he is sitting next to the right hand of the Father, next to the Father on his throne, exalted over the nations of the Earth. No matter how things may look from our perspective, he is there and he is not going anywhere. I'm so excited because the next friend that I want to introduce you to is a friend named Jennifer Rothschild. And Jennifer has an ability of seeing things that I don't often see. She has a vision for the world and for the future that requires a set of eyes that I wish she could give to all of us. I'm going to introduce her to us now and I've asked her to just share a bit of her vision for the church and America with you. Thank you, brother. Well, I do wish that you could see what I see. I was 15 years old. I was in the tenth grade and I began to have some difficulty with my eyesight. My math grades began to plummet and I didn't realize it was because I couldn't see the numbers in my textbook or the numbers on the chalkboard. When it was time to change classes, I remember being so nervous because I would constantly bump into students in the crowded hallways and I couldn't figure out why. I couldn't figure out why everyone else wasn't as clumsy as I was. I remember when it was time for P.E. We were playing softball and I remember holding my glove and standing out in right field and praying that a ball would not come to me because I could not figure out how when I would hear the crack of the bat, I couldn't figure out how these students could see the ball and catch it. So, I would just hold my glove and stare at the ground before me hoping I would see the shadow of the ball. And then of course, I would pray and aim and hope for the best. I'm telling you, P.E. really did improve my prayer life. [laughter] But it was one evening I was with my mom - we were going to visit a friend who lived in an upstairs apartment and as I was climbing those stairs with my mom, I was tripping up the stairs. And my mom stopped mid-stride and she asked, "Jennifer, can you not see those stairs?" And I was just as surprised, I said, "What do you mean, Mom? You can see the stairs?" Well, within about a week I was at an eye hospital. And after several days of testing at this eye hospital, it was diagnosed that I had a disease in both of my eyes called retinitis pigmentosa, degenerative disease. So, I was declared legally blind, but the prognosis of the disease was total blindness. Suddenly my very bright future was draped in shadows. That was 35 years ago and now my world is completely dark, and I've learned lots of lessons in the dark, but probably the greatest lesson I ever learned in the dark is that it does not have to be well with our circumstances for it to be well with our souls. You see, I can look through the eyes of faith even in blindness and I can see hope. But let's be very realistic, it's not always easy to see hope. I mean, we turn on the news, we don't see hope. When you surf the web, you see gloom, and despair, and defeat, and dread, and hatred, and division, and a million reasons why it is not well with our circumstances. But I want us as the church to see beyond those things that trouble our souls to the truths that make it well with our souls. And here's what I mean. When I walked into this beautiful room tonight I don't see any faces before me, so have no idea if the faces that surround me are smiling... -We are. -Thank you. [laughs] Or sneering. I know that's not the case in here. But in any given situation, i don't know if people are being inviting or intolerant, or if they're being hostile or hospitable. I don't know. So, consequently, I cannot be influenced by what I see or by what I don't see. That means that who I am and whose I am has the greater influence in my life. You see, we are the church! This is who we are. We can see beyond these things that may trouble our souls and we can see the truth that makes it well with our soul. We do not have be influenced by what we see or by what we don't see, but the truth of who we are and whose we are can be the greatest influence. Our culture does not influence us to know what our identity and hope is, no. Our identity and our hope as the people of God is what can influence our culture. It's not the words on the screen that tell us who we are and how we should feel. It's the Word that tells us who we are. And when we read the Word, we see that where there is darkness, we are the light. And where there's division, we bring unity. And where there is chaos, we offer peace. And where there's confusion, we bring wisdom. And where there is hatred, we bring love. And where there is fear, we walk forward in faith. And where there's hurt, we offer compassion. And where there is need, brothers and sisters, we are the provision. This is who we are. This is what I see. We are a beautiful church. We are the people of hope. And our hope shines brightest when our circumstances, when our culture is the darkest. That is the truth that makes it well with our souls, even if our circumstances never change. I don't know if my sight will ever be restored here on earth. I don't know if God will heal me. But if he does, I really hope I will still be able to see, to really see through the eyes of faith. And the only way I will continue to see through the eyes of faith and the only way you will continue to see through the eyes of faith is when our eyes are fixed on Jesus. Oh brothers and sisters, we can have courage and we can be encouraged. Instead of fixing our eyes on all that is not so well with our circumstances, we can fix our eyes on Jesus because he's the author, he is the finisher of our faith. And for the joy that was set before him, he endured his cross even though he despised the shame. And now as the King of kings, he has sat down at the right hand of the Father. And we are to consider him who endured such opposition so that we don't grow weary and we don't lose heart. And that's the way I see it and I hope you do too. -Amen. [applause] Thank you, Jesus. -Thank you. -Thank you, my brother. He is good. We, was that so deeply inspiring? I, I want to tell you that every eye here sees everyone else's eyes filled with tears with gratitude for how God works through you. -He is good. -He is so good, thank you. We are now going to move into a time of answering your questions from around the country. And so we want you to continue as you have been this last week sending us questions, things that are being discussed at your dinner table, things that are on your mind, questions for Dr. Ben Carson, for Jennifer, for James, for Francis, for me. I'm gonna ask Ben, if you'd come up, Francis, if you would come up and Jennifer, come on over here. -Thank you, brother. -And keep sending in your questions. You can type your comments in to Facebook. Make sure you include the hashtag "Revive Us," #ReviveUs with your questions. We've collected some already, so we're going to start with one of those to get us going. All right, here we go, here's our first question. "How do we guide our children to keep their faith in these times when our government and a godless culture are trying to destroy it?" That came in on Facebook. Francis, I think that you should answer that question because you have the most children of all of us. [laughter] How many kids do you have? -I have seven children. [applause] Yeah. [applause] Clap for my wife on that one, she did all the work. [laughter] You know, I teach my kids from an early age that you know, when you look in the Scriptures, the Christians were never the popular ones. Okay, Jesus, look at our Savior, he was crucified. And Jesus said, John 15, "If the world hates you, keep in mind they hated me first." And so they understand from an early age that what we do as a family, we believe is right in the eyes of God, but that doesn't mean everyone's going to love it. -Right. -And because we obey this book. But what happens is that God listens to us, like he knows us. And Lisa and I have really just tried to show them, look, Mom and I just prayed for this and look what happened. Mom and I prayed for this, God listens to us. And they've seen the miracles in our families. And it's like, gosh, when you guys get married, I want you to pursue this type of family because we want God's favor. And so there have been times when, sure, when they're younger we tried to shelter them. Or I don't know about shelter, but when they're really young, we don't want them to watch the wrong things. -Right. -Keep them away from, you know, locker room talk. [laughs] You know, just the junk that can be out there sometimes. But at the end of the day, it's like we can't shelter them from everything. It's got to be in them. And that's the miracle that we can't do. Like we could lock her daughter in a room until she's 18, but then what happens when she leaves? It's about her heart. And even remember my oldest daughter, there was a point when she wasn't walking with God, you know, her junior high years. And it just killed me. And my wife even said, did we fail? Did we fail? I go, no, because we, we haven't been hypocrites, we've been walking with him. It's just based on what I read in this book, she's got to make her own decision. And unless she makes that, there's no hope. But if the Holy Spirit enters her, then everything will change and she'll desire this from the inside out. But I can't make her fall in love with Jesus. I still remember the day, you know, like later when she came in my room and said, "Dad, you're right. I didn't know him. The Holy Spirit wasn't in me." And I go, "Well, I don't know, maybe I was too rough." She goes, "No Dad, you're right, and I know it because I know him now." And she goes, "When I talk to God now, it's like talking to you. He's right there. I know him." And seriously, from that point on, it's like everything changed. And so all the, you know, negative influences were still around her, but now it was the desire of her heart to stay away from it. -Amen, that's good stuff. [applause] What a good word for us as parents. What a great responsibility we have as parents. And yet you're reminding us and giving us the comfort of knowing that there is no recipe, quick fix, there is no, follow these steps and out pops a Christian child. This is the work of the Holy Spirit and we need to trust and we get to trust him in that. All right, let's go to the next question. Our next question is, "As a Christian, my conscience is deeply conflicted in this election. I don't feel right voting for the lesser of two evils. How do I participate in the election without violating my Christian conscience?" Dr. Carson? [laughter] Well, actually it's a very appropriate question for me because I'm a brain surgeon. [laughter] And the reason God gave us a brain is so that we could make decisions. You know, every day when you get out of the bed and you get dressed and you walk out of that door, until the time you get back in that bed, you are making choices between the lesser of evils because we live in an evil world. So if you're unable to do that, you really can't exist. So that's a cop-out, quite frankly. You know, a paper cut is bad. It stings, and hurts, nobody wants to have one. Also getting both your legs chopped off is bad. It hurts, it doesn't feel good, nobody wants that. But I guarantee you everybody listening could make a choice between those two things. And they wouldn't say, "Ah, they're both equally bad, it doesn't matter. I'll just sit back and wait and see what happens." And I think what you have to do frequently is take yourself out of the center of the equation and start thinking about the overall good. Start thinking about the health of the nation, start thinking about your children and your grandchildren and what will happen to them if we go in one direction versus the other direction. And we have to clearly ask ourselves, are there people who are concerned about our First Amendment rights and are there people who perhaps don't seem to be as concerned about them? Are there people who are concerned about education in the right way and teaching true history of this nation? You'll notice that, you know, civics isn't taught much anymore and true American history, to the point that a lot of young people who are growing up think that we're a bad country. You know, they're taught that we represent slavery and Japanese internment camps and Jim Crow-ism and everything bad that they can imagine. So when they see our flag, they don't want to salute it. They say, "This represents evil America." When in fact, what they should be thinking about are the incredibly courageous men and women who gave everything, including their lives, so that we could have freedom in this country. And we have to begin to ask ourselves, is it our turn now? Do we have a responsibility for those who are coming behind us? And I think when we begin to think that way, we can easily make that decision. [applause] Here's the next question. This question is also from Facebook. "I have a lot of anxiety about the world we live in. What can I do to reduce my anxiety? And is there any scripture that has guided you?" Jennifer, will you answer that one? -Yes. I, I love that question because I feel that kind of anxiety too. I think all of us do, especially in America during this season where there's so much uncertainty. And really if you boil it down, the language of anxiety is 'what if.' What if, what if the election doesn't turn out like I think it should? What if so-and-so wins or so-and-so loses? What if this happens to our nation? What if? And that's the language of uncertainty and anxiety. And we're the people of God and we don't live in that area of anxiety. We don't live with the what if's, we live with the what is. And what is, is that God is sovereign. What is, is that his will, his kindness, his compassion, his sovereignty doesn't rise or fall based on an election in America. And so we can focus on the what is. I believe it is Daniel 4:17 speaks of the sovereignty of God that the Most High is sovereign over the rulers of nations. And he's the one who puts into office and out of office. That's what is. That is the truth of what is. So we can focus on the what is and leave the what if's behind because they're out of our control anyway. But we can put what we don't understand in the hands of the one who does understand. We don't get it, but God's got it. That's how I like to think of it. But I know another Scripture that really does help me, just from very practical... -Yes, yes. -2 Corinthians chapter 4 verses 16 through 18 speak of an eternal perspective. You know, this is much bigger and much further than today and tomorrow. We can look at our lives with an eternal perspective. And so Paul is saying because of this eternal perspective, therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly it might seem like everything's wasting away and falling apart, inwardly, daily, we are being renewed. And these light and temporary troubles, and there's quite a few of them, they are working within us a far greater weight of glory. Because these things that we see, they really are temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. So that helps us focus on the what is and having eternal perspective. -That's fantastic. [applause] What are those, what are those Scripture numbers again? If, if you're looking for a cure to anxiety, write these down. Daniel? -Daniel 4:17 is the election anxiety. [laughter] General anxiety, we'll go with 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verses 16 through 18. -Fantastic. We have time for another question. Let's go to our next one. "Do you think it's even possible to change the culture long-term? Isn't this being idealistic? After all, isn't Satan the 'god of this world,' and aren't we living in the end times?" Well as the "Left Behind" guy, I guess I should answer this question. [laughter] You know, it's very interesting to think about who you perceive is the god of this world in this sense. A verse that comes to my mind is, and one of my favorites that gives me such hope for the future, is John 12, verses 30 and 31. Where Jesus said, "Now is the judgment of this world." He said, "Now is the judgment of this world." And James talked to us a moment ago about what that world means. And he said, "The god of this world shall be cast down. And when I am lifted up, I will draw all men to myself." And so if you think of that in a picture here, you have the god of a godless world system. Jesus comes to destroy the works of the Devil. He says, now something is about to be broken, this world and its power is about to be broken, and that leader is going to be cast down and another leader is going to be lifted up, speaking of the manner of his death on the cross. And when that happens, there's a massive power shift that occurs, drawing people to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. So when Jesus said, "All authority has been given to me, both in heaven and on earth," right, he took the keys to the Devil's house, right? He said, "All authority has been given to me." He conquered death, he defeated the grave, ascended into Heaven, sat down at the right hand of the Father. He's ruling and reigning in session with the Trinity right now. He removed the brick-and-mortar temple in Jerusalem and now says, Phil, you're the temple, Ben, you're the temple, Jennifer, Francis, you're the temple. And there are hundreds of millions, if not billions of us walking worship centers all over the world. We went from the very beginning of a handful of frightened disciples, followers of Christ, to now a third of the population of planet Earth that claims the name of Christ and many born-again believers filled with the Spirit. And now Jesus says to his followers, "Go and disciple the nations and I will be with you to the end of the age." So I believe absolutely that the ruler of heaven and earth is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. That defeated, illegitimate ruler, Satan, is on his way to the lake of fire and the only authority and power he has is what people give him and he uses fear and shame and guilt to control others. But we don't have to follow him because we have the Lord of heaven and earth as our king. [applause] Well, you know what encourages me most is that here we are, we just rolled up our sleeves and we applied true religion. We applied knowing God, loving God, we applied his word from the Bible to issues of the day. And we sit here as an example of a mixture of different races, different denominations. We have things that we are able to bridge. Why? Because we're gathered in unity around the one thing that, that brings us together no matter what our differences are and that's the Word of God. The plumb line for truth. This is true north for politics, for economics, for spirituality, for church, for family, for education, for everything. That's why we can do this. Again, we are just unloading the whole truck for you tonight and giving you lots to digest. And so I'd like us now to once again move to a time of worship together. In theaters across the nation, we'd like for you to stand again, worship with us, with the worship team. You know them as Passion. Their song, "Salvation's Tide" is what we're going to sing with them. Would you please stand? ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪ Oh, give us dreams tonight ♪♪♪ All over the nation tonight, we seek his face. ♪ Oh, Jesus wash it away, wash it away ♪ ♪ Let the walls come down ♪ Let the lost be found in Jesus' name ♪ ♪ In Jesus' name ♪♪♪ ♪ Oh let it be, let it be so, Lord ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [applause] I believe that salvation and the tide of revival is rising. I believe that. Because we serve a God who is exalted overall. Are you hearing a theme this evening? Are you hearing the theme? America's problem is a heart problem. It's not primarily an economic problem, a political problem or a racial problem, it's a heart and soul problem. And it's a problem that cannot be fixed by the government or by the president. It can only be fixed by the power of God working in the hearts of his people. Now I've been promising you for months now on television, on radio, on social media, everywhere that I can make this promise to you that I would share with you a strategy that has always worked and never failed in every generation on every continent to restore and revive a nation. I'm going to share it with you right now. It's amazing. It's so simple. In fact, you're not going to believe it when you hear it because it's so obvious you've probably read it at least a dozen times, likely more than that, right here in your Bible. You can find it in Deuteronomy, chapter 6. What if I told you that Moses himself spoke this to his people as his last words to them just before they were to enter into a land where the culture seemed too big, too strong, too dark, too much for them to handle. He had just finished leading them for 40 years in the desert, he's about to deliver his final words and here's what they are: it's called the Shema. Deuteronomy chapter 6 and you find it in verses 4 through 9. "Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is one," or "the Lord alone." This is a sacred prayer to Jewish people, the Shema. The Shema means "listen." And not just listen, but, but be careful to obey. We're not to be just hearers of the Word, but doers of the Word. Listen carefully and obey what you're about to hear, Moses is saying. This is the last words I'm going to speak to you - here they are. The Lord is our God. Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad. Know God, he is one God, he is the only God, he alone is God, he is the Creator, the loving Creator that made you, that made me, that made this world. He loves you, he wants to forgive you and he wants you to be free. That's the true God. And not just free in Heaven, but free here, now. Free internally from the devastating power of selfishness and sin, and free externally from those who are controlled by that god of this godless world system who has been defeated, yet they still follow his ways and they seek to oppress other people in the process, just like their father. He wants us free from all of that. Look at the next verse. "Then love the Lord," this God, "with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." To know the true God is to love him. You see, it's the false picture of God that drives people away. Some people have this view of God that is like this angry old man sitting up on a cloud with a long white beard and a furrowed brow just firing lightning bolts down at people who make mistakes. Or on the other side, he's this namby-pamby Jesus who's so meek and mild he just can't do anything about the evil in the world. Neither are true. We have a God who is righteous and holy and just. And we see at the cross his wrath towards sin. And yet at the cross we also see his loving-kindness and his mercy and his graciousness, his compassion. And he sacrificed his own son so that we could live and be loved by him and completely forgiven by him and totally accepted by him, and adopted into his family and made complete in him. This is the true God and to know him is to love him. Look at the next verse. "These commands that I have given you today are to be on your hearts." God gives his commands in his Word and they are to be stored up in our heart. And to know his commands, we've got to read his Word. We've got to know him and love him, but then also know his ways. And then teach them to your children. "Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up." In other words, in everything that you do. Let your children see you not only know God, but loving him with all your heart and with all your soul and studying his ways and applying those ways. Let them see you doing life together with your husband and your wife and your church and your community and let that compassion be visible to them in everything that you do. And they will begin to see and want that by God's grace. And then, "Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads." Now that's a little strange language in our culture, but this is, the Jewish symbolism here is your foreheads, speaking of your mind, and your hands. In fact, Orthodox Jews even today will take the law and commands of God and actually put them on their arms with leather straps and have those commands right here on their arm with straps going down and around their wrists. And the commands will be actually physically on their foreheads between their eyes. And the idea there is that the thoughts of your mind, the strength of your arm, the work of your hands, everything that you think about, everything that you do is according to God's ways. That they are a manifestation of God and his Word. And "Write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates." It doesn't just stop with your mind or just stop with your heart, it permeates to the work of your hands and all that you do so that your children are watching, they're playing follow the leader. Their eyes are on you. Now write them on the door frames of your house. And Jewish people today, just a few days ago were, are attaching the commands of God to the door frames of their home. And it's not just for, for them that they put it there, it's for those who come into the home, in the doorframe, on your porches, at your front door. So that those who come and see that this is a house where God's ways are being honored and it's a blessing and it's wonderful because God's ways are good for all people. And then all the way out to your gates. This speaks of the seat of government. This is where laws are made. We're in the city gates in this culture. Take the ways of God and his commands, which are good for everyone, to protect the good and to punish the evil and make sure that your laws are based on these good, eternal principles. This is an amazing strategy. And if you think this is just 3000 years ago for Israel, take a look at this. This is a monument that is sitting on a hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts. It is called the Monument to the Forefathers, built only 150 years ago in honor of the Pilgrims who came and settled this land. And you know what they brought over with them? They brought the Shema in their hearts and in their Bible. And their children's children's children turned it into the largest granite monument in the United States. It is. It's sitting there today and it spells out exactly what Moses talked about. The very top of the monument, quickly, is Faith. She's the largest of all the statues. And she's holding a Bible. In fact it's the Geneva Bible brought over by the Pilgrims, specifically. She's pointing to the one true God of heaven. The star on her forehead represents wisdom because they read God's word to understand his commands. And that faith was expressed first through their morality. It wasn't an imposed standard, it was a heart transformation that caused them to want to do the right thing and love what God loves and hate what he hates. And if you look at morality there, she's holding the Ten Commandments in her left hand, the scroll of Revelation in her right hand, and the evangelist is on her side indicating that the heart change must occur through the gospel before you give a standard of morality to live by. Now she has that in her heart and she's loving God with all of her heart, she can now teach it to her children. And you see here next to her is Education. That's a mother teaching her children. This was a parent directed task. And she's teaching her children in the way they should go so that when they're old, they will not depart from it. And of course, this was to fill her home and then go all the way out to the city gates. And you see that right next to her, Law. There is the man of law sitting in his chair of authority. He's holding the book of law, which is balanced by mercy and justice. And it's directly beneath the book held by Faith's hand, which is the Bible, the Word of God, indicating that the word and the law of the land created by man would never supersede the laws held by faith, which are the eternal principles of God. And the result would be on the other side of law, which is Liberty. And there's liberty man. His sword is sheathed. That represents the sword of the Spirit because tyranny has been overthrown. He's wearing the helmet of salvation, the belt of truth, the gospel sandals of peace. The chains on his wrists and ankles are broken. Tyranny, symbolized by the lion, you see that on his shoulder the claw is just there, the hide is draped over his back. And he's vigilant, looking out. He's ready to defend his faith, his family and his nation. He's the product of the Shema. And to his left is his wife, her name is Peace. And she's holding a basket that's overflowing with blessing for her family. This is a fantastic strategy. And what, what cinches this for me is Jesus himself when he was asked, "What is the greatest commandment of all?" He answered without hesitation and quoted the Shema. "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul and with all your strength." This isn't just an ancient strategy, it's an eternal strategy. It is the only strategy from your heart flowing to the works of your hands into your home and out to the city gates. It always works and it never fails. I am so excited and honored to be partnering with an organization called My Faith Votes. They have a mission to mobilize the 90 million Christians in America to let their light shine and to make their voice heard and their vote count at the upcoming elections. Did you know that there were 25 million registered Christian voters during the last presidential election who voted for no one? They simply stayed home, did not show up. Christians are the largest single voting block in our nation, Christians. If we engage, if we participate, the results would be miraculous. If we would engage and not be discouraged and hide in a corner but actually be salt and light at the city gates, we could absolutely, 100 percent, unstoppably determine the direction of the future of our country for our children. Please watch this video from My Faith Votes. I'm Sarah and I'm a fifth-grade teacher. I pledge. My name is Ben and I've been the dad for two years. I pledge. I'm Nathan. My family's been farming for over 150 years and I pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag... Of the United States of America... And to the Republic for which it stands... -One nation under God... -Indivisible... With liberty and justice for all. "One nation under God." We say it, we believe it. Do we live it? The last three presidential elections were decided by an average of just five million votes. More than 25 million Christians who were registered to vote did not vote in the 2012 presidential election. Do the math. -I pledge. -I pledge. I pledge. Join 90 million Christians on November 8, 2016. Together we make the vote. One of the things I love so much about My Faith Votes is on their website they have what they call a personal voting assistant to help walk you through the whole process. It's called Turbo vote. It's amazing. You should go there and check it out at their website. Why are we doing all of this? A lot of people are taking time out of their life to come here into the theaters all across the nation and we're doing this because we've got a lot of skin in the game. I know I do. I have six children. Francis has seven. You have children that are looking to you for answers and hope for the future. We're passing the baton to the next generation. I would like to introduce you now to two very young ladies who, they're not very young, but they're young ladies who are very important to me, they're very precious to me. One of them is my daughter Bella and the other is a friend, a singer and songwriter, Abby Ward, and they would like to sing a song for you to remind us where our true hope comes from. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [vocalizing with music] [vocalizing with music] ♪♪♪ [applause] How are you feeling? You may be seated. [laughter] So what do we do? What should we do? First...pray. We pray. Revival begins with prayer, heartfelt, fervent, believing prayer. We need prayer warriors. Like did you see that movie, "War Room"? Did you see that movie? [applause] Remember Miss Clara, the older woman who was teaching the younger woman how to pray for her marriage, for her, for her family, for her nation? That's what we need. You know, I, I actually invited a very special friend to come tonight and I'm wondering if she's here yet. Miss Clara? -Yeah, I'm here. [light laughter] [applause] I'm on my way, you know it takes me a while sometimes. It takes me a while sometimes, Kirk. [chuckles] My knees don't do with they used to do. Oh, my goodness gracious. It's a blessing to be here with all of you. And I would like for all of you to join me with your hearts as I pray. [instrumental music] You've done it again, Lord, you've done it again! And you are good and you are mighty and you are merciful! And you keep taking care of me, Lord, when I don't deserve it! Thank you, Jesus, you are Lord! Send me another one, Lord. Guide me to who you want me to help. Raise up, my Lord, who will call upon your name. Raise up those, Lord, that love you, that trust you and seek you. Raise them up, Lord, raise them up! Lord, we need a generation of believers who are not ashamed of the gospel! Lord, we need an army of believers that hate to be lukewarm. That will stand upon your Word above all else. Raise them up, Lord. Raise them up. Lord, I pray for unity among those that love you. I pray, Lord, that you would open up their eyes so that they can see your truth, Lord! I pray, Lord, for your hand of protection and guidance. Lord, we need a generation that will take light into this world. That will not compromise, Lord, when under pressure! That will not cower, Lord, when others fall away! Raise them up, Lord, raise them up! Lord, we need warriors that will proclaim that there is salvation in the name of Jesus Christ. Warriors who will fight on their knees, Lord. That will proclaim, Lord. Give you all that they have, Lord, worship you with their whole hearts! Lord, call us to battle that we may proclaim you King of kings and Lord of lords! These things I pray with my whole heart, Lord! Raise them up, Lord, raise them up! [applause] Amen. [applause] Do you know what's happening right now? Do you realize what's happening all across our nation? More than just two or three of us are gathered in the name of Jesus. Amen? We are worshiping together, we are praying together, we are calling for God to tear open the heavens and revive us together. Our light is shining. In fact, I want you to see something right now. This is a picture of what is happening at this very moment around our country. Look at this map of the United States. This first light is Chicago, where we are at the Cathedral, and the theaters around us. Each point of light you now see appearing is another theater in the U.S. that is praying with us, worshiping with us and learning how to revive our nation. Look how many theaters are with us together right now. This is you, this represents you in these rooms, thousands and tens and tens of thousands. We've got all the dark places surrounded. And this doesn't even account for the tens of millions who are not with us right now, which is why you need to go home and bring them back with you next week for the rebroadcast of "Revive Us," Monday night on the 24th. It works. From our hearts to our hands to our homes to the city gates. Here's what I want you to do: pray. Everyone can do it. Pray with your whole heart, believing prayer. Think. Think about what you've heard tonight. You've heard deep truths, thrilling, inspiring truths. Think about those things, talk about them with those in your theater tonight and at your home tomorrow and at the workplace tomorrow. And then vote. That is one physical way you can let your light shine. If you don't, you're putting it under a basket. Pray, think, vote. Because when our family gets together and the Spirit is moving, we are unstoppable. I want to give you a blessing as you drive home tonight from your theater. My pastor always gives this blessing to us at the end of a church service. I'm not your pastor, but I'd like to give this to you anyway. It's straight out of the book of Numbers, it's the Aaronic Priestly Blessing. And we give this to our children as we put our hands on their head every night before they go to sleep. And I like to give this to you. Would you just join me now, in theaters as well, and raise your hands to the ceiling like you were about to receive a blessing, a gift from your Father in heaven. Now I realize I just made all the Baptists very uncomfortable in the room. [laughter] But the Pentecostals are thinking, all right! It's about time, let's get this party started! Whoo! [cheering] All right, easy, easy. [laughter] And now may the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and your family and give you peace. In Jesus' strong name, we pray. Amen. -Amen. [applause] Now before you leave the theater, for post-event activities, post-event action activities. There's many there for you to help you. And remember, you have the theater to yourselves as a community for the next 10 minutes. We have bought the time, it is a time for you to stay in the theater if you wish to pray and to discuss. Meet other people who have come for the same reason you're there. You might not even know them and they can become your new friends. We hope this has been a blessing to you. It sure has been to us. We thank God for you. Good night. [applause] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪
