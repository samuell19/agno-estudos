What did Shengri Pharmaceutical let you do? Once in a national media In the interview, the time to predict the killing was approaching Here and now, Shengri Pharmaceutical Headquarters looks tense {\ an5} Police Special Attack Corps The police regarded the announced killing as a terrorist attack Therefore, the police special forces of the two teams are arranged inside and outside of Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical just in case Turn off the camera for a while before recording senior is it going well?

(Access control area) Forget it, what can you understand A paralytic shellfish toxin called PSP that comes into contact with the skin Now it spreads quickly to the whole body The strange thing is that all patients are acute So far, no treatment has worked Although we are also panicked But we will do our best Why stand there, sit here This wine is a free vaccine we provide Wine from the Prime Minister of South Africa President Director Kim is dead I know I also saw the news Director of the Institute, Kim Jong-kyun And the cause of Min Seok's death Okay, okay It's okay, just tell me Brother, the cause of death of two people I heard that the death was caused by PSP This must be related to this clinical trial That was done because of need Please apologize Who do you apologize to? Who else Of course it’s for people participating in clinical trials Are dead, let me apologize to the dead body No, do you really want to apologize? Hey, if it's my personal business, I will apologize But I’m the general manager of a company This is a company business, Shangren Big brother I will discuss it with my home What did you say? Do you want to discuss with your daughter about apologizing? Shangren, our time is over Now it’s time to nominate someone to lead the company I'm leaving now, chairman Shangren Shangren Uncle, why are you leaving so soon? You see how thin your face is, it really makes me sad Yeah, why did you follow Director Kim? It's raining hard outside, take this umbrella You are leading the clinical trial, right? What do you mean Didn't Dad already get your autographs? Until now, we have been making medicine to save people But didn't you force the clinical trial for the money? Don't you have any responsibility? Uncle I'm all for the company A person who has dedicated his life for the company Then you should always try your best This is not your dad and my dream We do our best... Really Why do you have a dream in my company? What did you say? Say that kind of cowardly words Murderers look down on us Anyway, I know how to make excuses when I'm old That is to say, you will be the one who will lead us to Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical from now on, right? Good Uncle I will work out a plan with the strategy team Really The reason why the attack on Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical is unnatural here It might be because you manipulated too many corpses at once And the pattern of the spell The one on the wrist I saw that after the shot was shot at that location Someone can't move So say witch doctors and those who are here Is it connected by that tattoo? Professor, the leader of Zheng What do you think? Didn't the hospital also say that there is no way to save him? Not because of poison, but because of being cursed What about the solution? It must be lifted by the person who casts the curse himself Otherwise... Or kill the cursed person correct Anyway, thank you. If you have any questions, I will contact your professor. Anytime, it’s hard work Ok let's sort it out Shengri Pharmaceutical recruited one hundred homeless people to participate in clinical trials Because nothing will be a problem in the future However, there are not so many qualified Wanderers So even those who have stayed illegally used it So are there any people from Indonesia? Yeah In short, all clinical trial participants died due to side effects And the one who manages those hundred corpses This is the Park Yongho interviewed by reporter Lin At the time of the interview, wasn't it a corpse that had been dead for two months? The Xuan Zhemin I saw told me this All died just like that Then it seems that a month or so has passed A man from Southeast Asia came to our office Southeast Asia? Said that my family is doing part-time jobs in this company I wrote myself a letter that can make a lot of money Lost contact afterwards Who is that person's family? I don't know Is the one who was in charge of the show Park Yongho Yes, Park Yongho, I told him his contact information Tell him because I don’t understand well, so I went to that person Do you remember what that person looks like? Dressed like a Taoist priest A bit weird anyway Witch doctor Later, Park Yongho disappeared However, a hundred corpses also disappeared So the witch doctor killed Park Yongho Let him become one here Then manipulate that guy Transport the body to somewhere Then I made a hundred more here, right? No, there is no way to know the identity of the witch doctor Want to find out the identity of this witch doctor? We need a list of test personnel Only then can we know who his family members are How to steal the list from Katsuhichi Pharmaceutical? Prepare the camera, we are going to interview Now? What kind of interview? (Urban detective, we will become the mouths of powerless people) This time the project is from the US SFD side From the proposal of the development and production of shellfish toxins Starting from the raw materials of chemical weapons So we recruited homeless and illegal stayers and conducted clinical trials I don't think there will be any problems in the law Not that there will be no problems, but that they will not cause problems Because they are poor, because they are weak It seems like that The person the murderer wanted to kill They are all people who finally agreed to the clinical trial and stamped it Among the people participating in this clinical trial Person in charge: Kim Jong-kyun Director: Kim Min-seok Executive Director: Lee Sang-in Representative Director: Byun Seung-il Are there Indonesians too? I am not sure about the specific content But in the information I brought Participants’ volunteers and related documents Please confirm The interview you are doing now will also serve as evidence for the police Specialist, you knew it from the beginning, right This clinical trial is illegal Clinical trials may have side effects at any time And at the sacrifice of a few people Will save many people What is this clinical trial? With a few sacrifices, make medicine that can kill hundreds of thousands of people Is it this way I already apologized to you just now Yes, I will be responsible in my own way What about President Bian Seung-il? Is he going to apologize? Are we President Bian? That person he will never apologize He is that kind of person Because of your company, innocent people died To protect you like that Many policemen were injured today and are slowly dying I heard that your husband is in the hospital Really sorry Although there is a list of test personnel But the information is not credible Can I know who the witch doctor’s family is through this? Go to the illegal detention management station, you should compare them one by one No, where is he? Although I don't know where But I should be with you here Where the cursed corpse died... …Mix your own blood to create clay figurines The soil where the body died Where the body died Soil Professor Zhuo said that the method of manufacturing here is The soil where they died Mix with the blood of the caster to make a clay figurine Yes, that's what it said Isn’t that the place where the clinical trial personnel died?
