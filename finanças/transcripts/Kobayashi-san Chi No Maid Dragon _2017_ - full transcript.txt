Well, if I have to... Yes, yes. Hello? Oh, Miss Sasakibe. Good afternoon. Umm, I made too much candied sweet potatoes with chestnuts. Have some if you'd like. Well, we didn't make any of those.

Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Ram, Rabbit Dragon Snake Horse Ram Monkey Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Rooster Dog Pig Is that a spell? I'm surprised you know. It came up when I was searching the net for all things New Year. But I still can't accept it. How so? Well, they say the order of the animals was decided by who reached God fastest on the morning of the new year, right? Oh, yeah, there is that story. The Rat stole first place by hopping a ride on the Ox. God "Seriously!?" God What is it that you can't you accept? Okay, stop right there!

New Year's Greetings New Year's Cards? Yes. I bought them. I haven't written one of these in years. Candy Grab - December 31st - How do you feel about your first performance on the show? Well, I wrote my lyrics down on my hand so I wouldn't forget them, I had the noodle shop owner in the shopping district teach me the trick. but my palms are so sweaty they've all disappeared. Wow. Kobayashi. Put my kimono on. A kimono? Apparently she promised to join Miss Saikawa on her first shrine visit. She lent me a kimono so we can wear them together. A kimono, huh? It's not too tight? No. All right, all done. Oh! Incredible, Miss Kobayashi. That's like a magic trick. A long time ago my mother taught me the trick. Nice. It looks cute. You want to wear one, too, then, Tohru? Huh? First Shrine Visit I'm glad my kimono fits you. With a kimono, you can adjust the size for the chest, too! Yeah. These past few days we've been losing to the temptation of the kotatsu, but going outside for a change is nice. Yeah. Fresh air. It's a little cold. Kanna-san! Saikawa. So cute! Warm. Oh, you're here, too? Why are you here? Should I not be? I ran into Elma over there. I heard you could eat lots of unusual food here. Lucoa-san, what's with your kimono? Well, it is New Year's. I wanted to go traditional. What's your idea of traditional? S-Stop it! Hey, Kobayashi-san. Oh, that looks good on you, Mr. Fafnir. Yeah, it does. Hmph. Let's hurry! Before the amazake's gone! Well, shall we go? Yes! Episode 11 Year End, New Year! (No Comiket Bit This Time) Fried Chicken Amazake It's delicious 1 Cup 100 yen So sweet. Delicious Amazake It's a nostalgic flavor. Really? Yeah. I used to drink something like this often. It takes me back. Oh, and because you got drunk you and your sister— Evil-Banishing Arrow It's a pretty charm. Mhmm. Hey, Kanna-san. Want to buy matching ones? Matching? Yes. O-Of this r-relationship charm. Relationships A charm, huh? You want one? Academics An academics charm... One I made would work way better. You don't need any charms, Shouta? I'm from a family of mages. I'll achieve my desires myself! How cute! S-Stop it! You bought an evil-banishing arrow? It might be useful for researching new curses. How'd Comiket go? Thanks, we sold out. You're as popular as ever, huh. Looks like Faf-kun's "Curse Anthology 2" didn't sell any though. He produced a second after the first didn't sell this summer? Miss Kobayashi. What's that? Fortune Telling Fortune Telling Number Twelve Great Blessing Luck Georgie, you got great blessing! It's a blessing too great for a maid. You should have it, young lady. I'm fine. It's your luck, Sis—... Georgie. Miss Kobayashi, look! My fortune! Huh? Which one? Fortune Telling Number Twelve Great Curse Luck Great curse. This is my first time seeing it. What does it mean? Your wishes will prove difficult. The one you wait for will come. That which you've lost, won't be found. I don't really get, but it sounds like a great curse. Though I guess it also means things'll only get better from here. Yay! Hey, isn't it almost time? Huh? Seriously? Seriously, seriously. I wonder what's going on. Saturday, December 31st Oh, this year's almost over. Time sure flew by, didn't it? Thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

Young lady, are you all right? I'm just a little cold. Kobayashi, can I invite Saikawa over? Huh? Since it's warm under the kotatsu. Why don't we take this chance to invite everyone over? We have plenty of food, too. Sure. We should let Saikawa-san's and Shouta-kun's families know. Well then, everyone, let's go! Here's the ozouni soup, everyone. What's this? Did you make this? You don't have to eat it if you don't want to. Tohru and Kanna made the mochi. You went all out. Well, since you made it, I'll eat it for you. Thanks for the food. Slurp It's good! I learned the seasoning from Miss Kobayashi's family. It's not mild, huh? I'll make some sweet red bean soup later, too. Tohru. What meat is this? You get a special treat, Miss Kobayashi! I've told you countless times not to put in your tail. But it's about time you tried it, isn't it? It's a new year after all. It still won't happen next year or the year after. Eh? Just climb in with us. Okay. The kotatsu's the best. Kotatsus are nice. Maybe we'll buy one, too. Do as you please. Oh! I got to see the first sunrise of the year with Kanna-san, so this should be a good year. It's just a sunrise. The first sunrise of the year is special. There it goes. Yes. - January 2nd - Now, every year on January 2nd, it's the annual Tokyo Bay Ekiden! I want to watch anime. Which team will win today's race to Nagaura? That's on break until the new year's over. Eh? Well, I understand how you feel. Tohru, pick it up. I can't step away right now. What do you mean? It's closer to you, isn't it? Aah, fine. - January 3rd - Now, today's Tokyo Bay Ekiden, on January 3rd. The contenders for the win have been narrowed down to two teams! Are these people running the same race as yesterday?

I see. New Year's ending soon. Miss Kobayashi, you weren't going to see your family even for New Year's? Hmm. Every year, I spend New Year's sleeping off the year's fatigue. It's not like I'm on bad terms with my family. Occasionally we chat on the phone. Is that how it is with human families? I think it's different for everyone. In my case, living over here's the life I've grown used to. I think I understand. What about you? You could go back if you wanted to, right? You're not going to go see them? Living here with you is my life now, Miss Kobayashi. Yeah. Oh! It went in nicely that time. Yeah, it fell right... Ah. New Year's Money New Year's money? I completely forgot. New Year's money?
