You told me your husband was in Portland. - Please hurry. - You gotta be out of your mind. [Husband] I know you must have a man in there, Eloise. [Banging continues] Remember what I told you last week? [Eloise] Go, just go! - What are you doing? - Open this door, Eloise. - Terry, what are you doing? - Eloise, I'm warning you! - I'm looking for my damn shoe. - Never mind it, just go!

No, I'm not talking about that. This is different. It's good, it's unusual. I simply can't, Terry. You should know better than that. We can't use stuff like that. Forget it, Harry. I'm not gonna write any more of your kind of crap. Terry, you don't have to humiliate me, me such a good friend, and so early in the morning too. 'But I know you, I know you don't mean it.' No, look, Harry, I mean it. I sent that thing to you two months ago. When are you going to read it? Well, why can't you send me the cheque anyhow? I need the bread, you schnook. Can't you get that into your thick skull? Terry, Terry, I know you won't believe this, but our money machine just broke down. I got a couple of men trying to fix it. 'I hope maybe by Christmas. What's the matter with you?' Hey, Shaw, what are you doing, making love to a broad while I'm trying to talk business? I know you, I'm hip to you. You got a broad there. And I wish I was down there with you too. That gives me an idea. Maybe I should run down for a few days. I need a change. Hey, remember the last time? Why don't you shut up with your filthy talk? You got a dirty mind. Yeah, Harry. Listen, I'm all alone so why don't you just dry your pants and send me the damn cheque, you dirty, nasty old man? Well, then, I'll take it to somebody else. Do you hear me? Look, Terry, if you got your morning sickness again, I would suggest take a cold shower and a half dozen aspirins and use a vibrator on the back of your neck.

But I want to see you, Terry. Of course right now. You're a bit overdue, you know. Er, yeah, well, er... fine. Well, I'm a little busy right now. It'll be about two hours. Really, Terry. At times you can be quite crass. It's disgusting. That's not funny, Helen. I'm writing. Is that all you can think of? Money? Look, I've... I've got a beautiful scene going. I don't wanna lose it. - OK? - 'OK. 'You're hard at work. I'll give you two hours.' Yeah. Well, as quick as I can. 'And, Terry, there's no boo-boo here.' All right, well, then I'll bring some. 'Don't forget.' Bye. [Tyres screech] Terry Shaw, darling. Well, just don't stand there like a stick. Come on in. - Helen. - Here, let me look at you. Oh, aren't you the handsome one today? Terry, kiss me. - Where's your husband? - Around. Why? He wouldn't happen to be in Portland? Portland? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, nothing. I was just teasing. That some of your cute Grove talk? By the way, how is your daughter Jackie? Fine. She's still in Switzerland. Well, can we be civilised? Shall we have a drink? Helen, darling, make that a triple. Straight, no ice. Terry, I let all the servants go. [Terry coughs] Well, you wouldn't want them around, would you? How about a swim, Helen? Oh, no, darling. I'm going to stay right here.

Oh, you must be Terry Shaw. You know, baby, we could miscegenate, you and me. And be the first in the neighbourhood, miscegenate the whole neighbourhood. You know, I work for Henry Demole. We'd really freak him out. [Groaning] - It's cold, man! - Come on! It's cold! Terry, baby. Terry, you'll be all right. Come on, man! Oh, man, it's cold in here. Look, it's 85 degrees in here, man. It's the summertime. It's cold. 85 degrees here. Oh, man, it's cold in here. It's cold! Terry, you'll be all right... Terry! Why do you always argue with me, Oscar, when I say it's cold? When I say it's cold, I mean it's cold, brother. And when it's cold, what do you need? - Fire, that's right, brother. - Fire, fire. No, man, there's no wood. There's no wood, man. No, fires, right? You'll be all right in a minute. Terry! Terry, there's no wood, but that's OK, come on. Come on, you're gonna be all right. There's no wood? What do you mean there's no wood? Hell, I'm gonna make my wood speech. Oh, Terry! Come on, all you hippy, hillbilly rock 'n' rollers, gather around. [Indistinct chatter] Now, this man says there's no wood. What do you think? Talk up, man. What do you think? - There is wood. - That's right. Tell him, brother. Come here. - Come here, brother. - There's wood there, man. Now, the Lord said that there is wood, the Lord said that there is fire. This man says there's wood. Now, you wanna argue with him? - There's no wood, man. - There is wood. And there's gonna be fire. And I'm standing on the wood that's gonna be our fire. Do you dig on that? - Oh, Terry. - Oh, man. See that, Tweedie? That's wood. No, man, that's a chair. And wood is meant to be burnt, baby. - Oh, man. - Wood creates fire. And you see this, partner? That is fire, baby. Now, you see that? Ain't that fire? It looks like fire to me. You'd think there weren't no fire if your ass sat in it. Get away! Get back! Get back! [Overlapping shouting] [Indistinct chatter] [Terry] All right, now. People, you shouldn't be scared of fire. Give us more fire. More! [Indistinct chatter] Come on, everybody. A toast. A toast to the best fire. [Overlapping shouting] Henry, what are you doing? Well, they wanted a fire. Oh, no, man. Henry, Henry, Henry. We gotta live in this house. Just put it out. Put it out. [Henry] I'm trying. You're crazy. [Tweedie] I'll flush you down the toilet! - Put out the fire now! - No, no, no, no. [Shouting continues] [Shouting continues] [Shouting continues] [Whirring] [Phone rings] Hello? Yes, this is his house, but he isn't here right now. How should I know? He never bothers to tell me. But it's all right, I've got a friend here. Mrs Golden? Oh, all right, I'll tell him you called, but I don't know if he'll get your message. He met a spade chick a while back, and since then he hasn't been around much. Now, don't lose your cool, Mrs Golden. I'm his personal secretary. What did you think I was? [Hangs up] [Whirring resumes] [Rainfall] [Knocking] Helen? Helen! Oh, for God's sake, Terry, stop it. I told you, my husband's very ill. Go away. [Rattles lock] Let me in, damn it. I don't care about your husband, Helen. Let me in. All right, I'll let you in, but keep your voice down. Do you mind explaining this? I told you three times, my husband isn't well. You didn't call. If we're going to be so crude, what the hell's the matter with you? You know damn well why I'm here, Helen. Oh, really, Terry. That little cheque? I thought I explained that. You must be a little insecure about money, mustn't you, Terry? Well, I don't like being robbed, if you call that one of my insecurities. Well, I suppose you just haven't had the experience. Look, one must learn to take money with a little grace. I mean, it's not the most important thing, now, is it? Well, let's hope you learn as soon as possible. What's wrong with your husband, Helen? Never mind. If you do as I say, as I've always told you, Terry, dear, just put that little cheque right through the bank again, it'll clear and you'll get your precious money. Do you think you can do that, hmm? You still didn't answer my question. What's wrong with your husband? I told you, never mind. And if you're a good boy and try to show some manners, I'll give you some cash today to tide you over till you get to the bank. Would that be nice? Is that good? Oh, boy, you're really something else, aren't you? I suppose we'll have to call that manners. It really wouldn't be too disastrous, you know. $20 million? Your child's under age, you're the sole heir. He's old and sick. I don't wish to continue. Is it terminal? No, not really. He's just a little nervous and upset. There's nothing to it. How do I read that, Helen? That he's suspicious or that he knows? Darling, why don't you get comfortable? Hello, darling. What's wrong with him? Is he crazy? Helen, talk to him. I don't know. Talk to him, damn it! No! Harry! Harry, stop! No! Stop it, Harry. [Helen] Harry! Harry, stop! He's... Very dead. How can you be sure? What do you think, huh? Oh, it's ugly. He's ugly. I'll see you around sometime, lady. What do you think you're doing? You just killed my husband! You're nuts. Your husband had an accident. You killed my husband. You're out of your mind. Your husband had an accident. Helen, try to get a hold of yourself. You can't leave now. Baby, your husband had an accident. - Argh! - You can't leave me. Help me! You've got to help me. Help me! Terry, come back! Come back! [Engine starts] [Car drives off] Operator. Get me the police. Nadine! Damn it, when you need somebody. Hey, baby. Baby, what are you building? Terry? Terry? Mm? Baby? Oh, you've got a terrible head. - Baby, what happened? - Nothing. [Groans] It was an accident, Nadine. What? It was an accident. Will you please be careful? Please! Terry! [Phone rings] I'll get it. Don't. No... No, don't. Don't answer it. Oh, no, not yet. Why, you just got here. [Sighs] Pauline, honey, you just knocked me out. Ah, you silly boy, you. You silly thing. Oh... How about, um... How about a little joint for me? For you, baby? Oh, yeah, yeah. All right. That sounds like kicks. A little joint for my baby. Yeah, there it is. Damn. Oh, that's nice stuff. Don't you wanna swing a little bit, baby? No, not tonight, baby. I'm high. I'm as high as a kite. That's it, I'm a kite. I'm an uptight kite. Me too, baby. Oh, yeah, Baby Jane. What did you say, sweetheart? Nothing. I said I'm leaving. No. No, no, no. This is our date day. I'm with you and you're with me, kiddo. - 23 skidoo. - You're not going. You promised me. I don't even wanna talk about it anymore because I'm going. Oh, come on. We'll go to a happening or a love-in or whatever the hell you call it. Oh, that old line. And here we go. OK, hip cat. Now, you get ready right now. OK? I gotta make a phone call, call my agent. You go right ahead, sweetheart. Whee! There sure are a lot of weird people around here. [Humming] Hello. You know, the games that you play aren't very funny. What do you mean, &quot;Who is this?&quot; The games that you play aren't very funny. Terry, I... 'Helen, what the hell are you doing? Say something.' Terry. Well, what do you think? [Giggles] I rely on you. Am I right? What? Oh, I mean, you just might set a whole new fashion trend, baby. You're just saying that. OK. My wild young rebel. Oh, you. Let's go tear up the town. You sure have crazy wheels, man. - What kind of a car is it? - It's an Edsel. Is it safe? Just as safe as life, baby. [Laughs] - [Tyres screech] - Whoo! Oh, this is it. This is more like it. Where's the party? This is the party. Make yourself at home, Pauline. Hi. Oh, you're with someone. I'm making a drink. Somebody I know? Who is it? What is it? Take a look. [Banging] What's the matter with this damn thing? You were right, I can't make it out. She's really something, ain't she? Where did you get it? Terry! Yes, love? Where the hell are you? What should I do? Whatever you'd like to do. Can't do that. Improvise. That's where it's all at, baby. Oh, Terry, this damn thing won't work. Listen, you just sit down and relax. I'll take care of the music, all right? OK, I'll get ready for the action. Yeah, it's just a little bit broken. Yeah, you're right, baby. You just get set for the action. Huh? All right. Party time. [♪ Acid jazz] How's it going, swinger? Good. Boy, this drink will relax me a little bit. [Terry] Good, I'm glad to hear it. [Whispers] Terry, there's someone here. Where? Oh, er... Oh, yeah, that's Nadine. That's who that is. Nadine... Pauline. Pauline, Nadine. How do you do? She looks like a Negro. Yeah? Well, actually, she's, um... She's Varanasi but it's the same thing as a nigger. What's she doing here? I mean, you don't have friends who associate with... What are you, nuts? What are you trying to say anyhow? Come here, woman. What do you think I am, some kind of a liberal? She's my maid. Now, listen, you pickaninny, you go on out to the kitchen and you freshen up my drink, and do it right now before I whoop you a good one. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, boss. Terry, you really shouldn't be so mean to her. I mean, you should treat them just like... Mm... Damn savages, that's all they are. Terrible, the help you have to put up with these days. Mm... Motherfucking slaves, Pauline, that's all they are. By the way, did you see that son of a bitch of a butler of mine on the way in? - No. - No? Hm. Well, then, I'd better go check on the help.

Oh, poor baby. Here. Mm, a little more drinkie, a little more smokie. Yes! - Terry, my God, don't do that! - Why, what's the matter? Because she's here and she shouldn't be here.

[Girl] Mr Shaw? Mr Shaw, congratulations on your new book. I just had to meet you. My name's Jackie. I'm a writer too. You're a writer? - Yes. - Well, that's fantastic. Did you bring any of your material with you? Well, no, not really, just a few poems. I see. Well, listen, I have a room in the back. It's a lot quieter. I was wondering, maybe we could go back there so I can look at your material. - All right. - [Nadine] Terry? Terry? [Indistinct chatter] Yes, sir? What can I do for you? - You Shaw? - Yeah. Terry Shaw? You live at this address? - Yeah, that's right. - Look, Shaw... We wanna talk to you, alone. This could possibly be a serious matter. Well, er... Do I have to go downtown? Maybe, maybe not. All you have to do is answer a few questions. - Mm-hm. - Look, Shaw... Do you think that, um...? Do you think you could quiet down this convention by yourself? Because if you don't, we're gonna cause you an awful lot of trouble. Now, we've had five complaints here. We can hear your party all the way down the block. Now, if we have to get a warrant, we can do that too. You're gonna have to play it our way or else. Well, yeah, sure. Hey, listen, everybody! Everybody, quiet, be quiet. Keep the noise down.

Well, it's nothing to concern your pretty little head about. Come on. Hey, did you know that I used to be a professional prize-fighter? What made you switch to writing? Once, a long, long time ago, I fell in love with a girl, creative, talented, pretty, just like yourself. Come on. This is all right right here, isn't it? Do you wanna be a writer? Sure. Do you want me to hear your poetry? Yes. Well, I want you to read it to me. It's too loud, too noisy, out here. We'll go in my room, all right? All right. Young lady, there's something awfully familiar about your face. By the way, young lady, what did you say your name was? Jackie... Jackie Golden. [Gunshot]
