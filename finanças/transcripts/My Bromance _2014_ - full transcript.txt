Dad! Golf, son! Why didn't you tell me you were coming back? It wouldn't have been a suprise if I had told you. I got a bunch of new products from the company for you to try this time around too. Always working hard, Vut. P'Mai, that's the only reason I'm successful now. Who's this, Dad? Here you go. My name is Tara. This is my only son, his name is Bank. We hope you'll welcome us to the family. 'How was the party last night?' 'It was so much fun!' 'I thought Ekkamon shouldn't have done that on the stage.' 'He just got up and danced.' 'Exactly, I thought so.' 'Where should we go next week?' 'I think it'll be Maldives.' 'I feel that there'll be a great band in the next one.' - 'It'll be so much fun.' - 'I think so.' P'Golf? Do you want to take a walk together? Don't fucking call me that! I'm not your brother! Go take that damn walk with your fucking mom. - Hey, Jieb. - What? - What'd you do today? - What do you mean? Your face is looking more fucked up than usual. (laughing) Cause you're so handsome and hot. Excuse you but I'm an angel. I got a dream that might help you. Enough, chatting! Hello, and welcome to the new semester. I'm Mr. Nikom. I'm your homeroom teacher. Are you a fag, sir? Oh my, how vulgar. You look like a nice person. Why don't your words reflect that? What's your name? Where have you been? How can't you know my name? Look at your list and see for yourself. First page. The one marked in red. Kanthitat Atsawametanon. There is a 'bastard' in parenthesis next to it. - This is my first day teaching. - Okay. Alright, everyone. I have a new classmate I'd like to introduce to you all. He was actually in another school. But he asked the principal in he can be in the same one as his older brother. Hello. My name is Baworanant. You can call me Bank. I moved here from Srichada, Chonburi. At any rate, I hope you'll take good care of me. Kanthitat, there's an empty desk next to yours, isn't it? Let your brother sit next to you. Take good care of your new friend! Alright, we'll start the next period soon. Hey, Golf. Since when did you have a younger brother? How come you never told us about him? Actually, P'Golf is only 4 months older than me. So, he's technically my older brother. He doesn't have shit to do with me. He's not my brother. Um, let's get ready for class. (Chemistry, pages 6 to 10) (Math, practice book, pages 6-10) Golf! What's the rush?! Wait for me! What the hell are you doing in my room?! Dad told me to move upstairs and share the room with you. This fucker. Dad really did say that. We stick to our own space. You stick to yours. I'll stick to mine. What the hell do you keep dusting for? They say it's bad luck, you know. P'Golf, what are you doing? Why aren't you wearing any pants? It's my fucking room. Whether I wear something or not is my damn business. You can go back and sleep on the sofa if you can't handle it. Is he a fag? Real guys don't give two shits about seeing dicks, you know. Take a quicker shower the next time. You take too fucking long. You cleaned your inside too or something? I'm sorry. I was tidying up your room, so... - Are you saying my room is messy? - It's not like that! You like helping out, yeah? Good. From now on, you're my slave. Do whatever I tell you or you'll get it. Run and flag down a red van before I get there! - Yes! - Go! What the fuck! I told you to flag down the red mini van. Haven't you heard of that? What a dumbass. This is called a red van. Remember that. Come on, get in! The hell you standing there for? Get in. Hey, what the hell is this?! Stop! Stop! You're going too far now, Golf. How the hell can you treat Bank like this? Even if he is not your real brother, you have no right to treat him like this! What's in you? Get the fuck out of your business. - Asshole. - Fucking bitch! - That's enough! - He's not a slave. You can't do this to him! - Why are you fighting? We're all friends here. - Look at what he's doing! Jieb, he can do whatever he wants. Stay out of it. Jieb, Paan. Don't fight. I'm willing to do this for him. Bank! Why are doing this? Alright. It's over. Come on, we gotta go to class. Come on, Jieb! Thanks. What was that? I said thanks. He surely has a lot fans. He looks like an actor on TV. He doesn't at all! P'Thom is much hotter! Look, he's waving at me, Bank! Can I see your watch? - I'm gonna get going. - Already?! See you tomorrow! P'Golf, there is no one home today? It's like on the board. (Mom&Dad: Meeting, back at 11pm. | Aunt: Party, back at 1am.) Not that many pepople actually live in this house. You'll get used to it eventually. No one doesn't really pay attention to me anyway. I'll cook for you today then. No, thanks. I don't wanna get diarrhea. Do you want to eat or not? Or you can enjoy your frozen meals instead. Hello! Hello there! I'm the owner of this phone. I left it on a bench near the basketball court. May I ask where you are so I can get my phone right away? Oh, I'm at the seating area by the administrative building. Oh, I see. Thank you. Do you mind waiting there? I'm on the way. Sure. Oh, it's you! Thanks so much for finding my phone. It would've been gone forever if it weren't for you. You're welcome. How about I treat you to a meal as a thank you? - It's on me. - That's okay. But I'm waiting for my friends to do a group project. Ah, come on. I'll bring you back real quick. - I guess. - Wait for me here then. How did you know that I like papaya salad, P'Thom? I know a lot of stuff when it comes to you. - Aren't you going to have some? - No. You can be full without having to eat when it comes to certain things. P'Bank, someone asked me to give you this lunch box. Can I ask you something? Who asked you to bring this? It's a secret. It seems like you got stuff to eat every morning and afternoon lately. I guess I won't see you around the cafeteria eventually. It's not so bad. I won't have to walk and get tired. Here. Help me finish these. I don't want them! P'Golf! What's the matter? I'm sorry! - Hello, Dad? - Golf? - I forgot to leave you a note this morning. - Today is Bank's birthday. - It's also the anniversary of his father's death. - I won't be home tonight, so can you look after him for me? Dad? Where were you this evening? Why didn'y you let me know where you'd be? How did you know I was here? I'm sorry. I had just found out that today is your birthday. And that your dad ... Don't bring him up, P'Golf. Hey, don't cry. It's okay. I get it. I'm just glad you're not mad at me anymore. Don't do this again, okay? - I get worried, remember that. - Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay, that's enough. People are gonna start thinking we're a gay couple. Come on, let's head home. You've been to Chiang Mai before this, Bank? When? When I was little. But I can't remember much. Our school will have a festival next month. Each class will put on a show to compete amongst each grade. And I've come up with something for us already! I'm certain that it'll be beautiful, fabulous, and the most unique! What kind of a show, Sir? The Fingernail Dance! But teacher, how exactly is the most unique?! We do that all the time, we're so sick of it! My version will be the men doing the dance. Guys doing the fingernail dance? That's correct. I already have a star in mind. Baworanan. He's probably the prettiest, he can be lead. Me, teacher? I don't how to. Not to worry. That's what practices are for. Aren't you interested in having someone ugly in the show too? - I nominate Tued! - If my face is ugly then so it's yours! I'll switch from the fingernail dance to the exorcist version! P'Golf, do you think I seem like a girl? - Why are you laughing? - Why do you ask? Early today, the teacher said he wants me to lead the fingernail dance. That's like girl stuff, isn't it? And I'm not a girl. So why does he want me to do that? He probably thinks you'd do a better job than the girls. Better how? Like with the way you are to me. Can I take a look at these rings? They're couple rings. This is the last pair we have. It's our best selling item. - How much is it? - 499 Baht. - P'Golf, can I borrow 300? - I don't have it. Wait for me here? I'll meet you at the food court. Jieb and Paan told us to meet them there. - I'll see you there. - Sure. Excuse me. What happened to the rings I was looking at erlier? Ah, someone have already bought them ahead of you. I'm sorry. That was quick... Forget about it. It's just a ring. There are bunch of other things you can buy. I wanted to give that ring to someone special. It was really pretty, P'Golf. Someone special? Eh? You're dating someone now? Who? I'll tell you when the time comes. I'm begging you. Just tell me who asked you to bring these flowers. I can't tell you. It's a secret. Bank! - Can you do me a favor? - What is it? I think this chord is too weird. - What's wrong with it? - It doesn't feel right. - Change the key? - To what? Try F. - Add B here? - If we add it then it won't go with this lyrics. - P'Thom? - Ah, Bank! - I have a gift for you. - Thank you so much. It's not from me. It's from Jieb. She's my friend. Happy birthday, P'Thom. If it's not from you, then I'm afraid I can't accept. I already have someone I like. You already have someone you like? That's right. And the person I like is standing right here holding that box. Jieb! P'Thom, I gotta go. Bank! Jieb! P'Thom is gay! He is gay! He is gay...! I'm honestly not interested in him, Jieb. That's good! If you do, you'll get it! I knew it! I could tell by the way he sings. You shut the hell up! Nobody asked for your input. Jieb. - P'Thom is gay! - It's okay, Jieb. You can find someone as long as you're still alive. But those days, it might be hard to find one that's not gay. Who are you waiting for, Bank? P'Thom! Want me to drop you off at home? That's okay. I'm waiting for my older brother. Oh? You have an older brother? Bank! You haven't gone home yet? Not yet. I'm waiting for P'Golf. Did you see him, Tar? He probably left already. He didn't have practice today. Didn't he tell you? He didn't. I'll get going then. P'Thom, if you'll excuse me. Hey, do you have Bank's number? Aw, I can't just give that to you. He's gonna kill me. He won't give it to me if I ask him. How about this? I'll trade this for his number. I don't sell my friends out. Is that right? I seriously don't want any trouble. Golf would kill me too. - Who the hell is Golf? - That's Bank's brother. They're in the same class. Fine, I won't tell Bank that I got his number from you. Just take it. You could've told me that you'd go home before me. I was waiting forever. I saw you were talking to P'Thom. I didn't wanna bug you. You're mad at me because of him, aren't you? You always walk away! What are you so afraid of? That I'd get close with P'Thom? Fear can't help anyone get stronger, you know! Fine! Why the fuck are you talking to that asshole? You got a new brother so you don't give a shit about this one, right? I can't compete with him, can I? You are the one assuming things! I don't have any feelings for him! And you are my brother. What's going on, P'Golf? Whatever! That's how I think! Just leave me the fuck alone from now on! Go with your new brother! "I know too well that you wouldn't answer if I call you." "But I just want to tell you again that I don't have any kinds of feelings for P'Thom at all." "The person that I like... You want to know who that is, don't you?" "I'll tell you who that person is." "He's in the same class as me." "He's an athlete." "And the most important is," "I call him... P' " Bank! Bank! Bank! Bank! "If you're looking for me," "I'm on my way to the place he told me that he would take me." "But he broke his promise." Bank! Bank! P'Golf! It's dangerous sitting here by yourself. Did you really mean what you said that in text? Come on, answer me! Yes. It's okay if you find me disgusting... that I'm in love with a guy. And he happens to be my sibling too. If you had just told me this from the start, we didn't need to waste so much time. You don't hate me? How can I hate my own brother? I'm really glad that you feel the same way I do. I've had a crush on you for a while now too. Thanks for loving someone awful like me. Don't you have anything to say to me? It's not always necessary to use words to let the other person know that you love them. Promise me this? That you won't leave me? You are the one who should promise me that you wouldn't leave me. Okay! Then I promise. I won't leave you. And I'll do everything you want. I promise too. Come on. - Let's take a walk. - Yeah. For the next show, please welcome. The performance by the students from Grade 11.1. Bank. Come here. P'Golf? How'd you get in here? You're not allowed in here. My princess looks really beautiful today. If you keep looking so pretty, you'd better be careful around me since I won't be able to help myself. Jerk. Bank, it's your phone! - Hello! - Hello, Bank! It's P'Thom. P'Thom?! You were great just now. I loved it. How did you get my number? Never mind that. I know a lot of stuff about you. Are you free tonight? I want to ask if you want to get dinner with me. Aswer my question first. How did you get my number? I really can't tell you. Let's talk about us. If you don't tell me, I will hang up. and I won't answer a call from you ever again. Fine, I'll tell you. I got your number from Tar. He sold it to me. P'Thom, I have to go. - Hey, Paan! - Paan! Tar! How could you sell your friend's number like that? Paan, chill. Let's just talk. Tar sold Bank's number to P'Thom. Are you so desperate for money that you had to do that? Paan, it's okay. I'm not hurt or anything. I get that your family doesn't have a lot of money. But you went too far doing this! You're right! I'm poor! I just wanted to get some money so I could buy your birthday present, Paan! Happy birthday! I totally forgot. It's your birthday today. I'll talk to him! Happy birthday to you! Tar likes you! Happy birthday to you! Tar likes you! Happy birthday, Happy birthday... Happy... birthday... To you. The ring. This is the one I wanted to buy. You bought it before I could? Yeah. I'm sorry. This is the one I wanted to buy. I wanted to give you this since last week. But... I was too scared. I was afraid you wouldn't love in that way. But now... you're brave enough to love me in that way. Love... isn't really about being brave or not. It's about whether you want to love or not. But anyway, do you want to? Pervert! Bank! We're going on a trip. We need to be prepared. - These? - Not those! - Oh there. - What? Can you help me pick the soap? Which scent should I get? I like whichever scent my boyfriend likes. P'Golf! What are you doing? There are people here. It's embarrassing. - You're embarrassed? - Let's go. If you don't, I swear I'll get mad. Aw, P'Golf! Don't be mad. I have a present for you tomorrow night. - Good. I'll be waiting. - P'Golf! I said there are people here! That was the end of my album, "Save My Life". Wasn't it awesome and beautiful? Yeah. Jieb. Still interested in P'Thom? Or are you into these kind of guys now? I forgot about him. I could never have imagined that the guy I chose be the father of my children turns out to be gay! He is so handsome and cool! It's too bad! Maybe you should look at someone else. He's just as handsome and cool. He's good at playing instrument too. And he's not gay either. Hey, did you think before you started talking? Even if you come with a thousand other bonuses, I don't want you. Pfft! - What? What? - Enough, enough. I don't get it. How can a guy and a guy be in love? I get it if they love one another like brothers. But like boyfriends? That's disgusting. It doesn't always mean that they're gay if two guys love each other. Yeah, yeah. You think everything is rainbows and unicorns. Keep thinking that, good luck. You're probably never gonna find a girlfriend. You gotta be assholes like Golf and me. How come? Let me tell you something. Good guys are not attractive. Come on, you don't have to sing anymore. You guys can listen to my songs now. You can play the guitar, okay? - What about my "Save My Life"? - You're not playing that. Just start playing. Listen to me, you guys shut up! Check the chicken. Crap, mine's burning! Wait, wait. Oh, I remember now! During that festival, right? This song is for everyone who is waiting for someone to confess their love to them. Bank. I have something to ask.. What is Jieb? Well... Don't think that we're trying to get up in your personal business or anything. We just wanna know... that if you and Golf are... Are... A couple, right? So... is it true? Yeah. Will you all find us disgusting for being this way? No, Bank. Don't forget that we are friends. How can a friend cut ties with another friends just because he is gay? If that's the case that they were not really your friend. Yup. You have us, don't worry. Let us know if we can do anything. Thanks, Paan. Jieb. That's okay. Do you know, you're the first person who can keep Golf under control. He wasn't like this before. He skipped school. And even if he showed up, he didn't really pay attention. Hot tempered, always picking a fight. He had a shitty mouth too. And he was a total playboy. But ever since you moved to our school, he's completely different person. He has never looked at any girls since either. Aside from this guy right here. But anyway... You and Golf live in the same house. Do you do stuff together? - That's none of your business! - I'm just curious! Does he try? A little. That's really fun. We should go again after next semester. Yeah, we should. It's so hot! These curtains... We're finally home! We're finally home! P'Golf, come on! I'm tired. You're so dirty, I'm not doing anything yet. You're on top of me, anyone in my place would think of that. Golf! Aunt?! Come here! Come here! Aunt! He wasn't doing anything to me! Please don't hurt him! Get away from here! You're the reason why my nephew is like this! Aunt! Stop hitting him! Please! Get off! What were you doing?! What's going on between you two?! It's my business what's going on in my life! What's it to you?! Then tell me! How many men out there can stay in love for a long time?! You are the one to talk! What about you and uncle?! If you two were in love, then why did he dump you and left you to be an old spinster?! P'Golf! Golf. Why are you doing this, son? If you are gonna ask questions, then I want to ask you too. Who asked you and mom to fall in love? Isn't it the same! It's natural when a man and a woman spend time together and fall in love! - It's the same thing to me! - It's not. Your kind of love isn't accepted by society! It's a man and a man! What about you, Dad?! Can you accept me?! I'm a guy that's in love with another guy! What's wrong with that?! Golf, son. I'm begging you. Don't be like this. Think of me. Think of our family members. Think about our ancestors. Tell me what you want, I'll get you anything. No! All you do is throwing money at me! Do you ever bother to understand me?! If you want me to stop being like this, then you try stop being with your new wife! Can you do that?! You can't. Golf! This is your father! Apologize to him right now! No! He should apologize to me! You're the reason I was born, but you have never cared about me! Fine! Alright! If you think that I haven't cared, I will take you to America with me! You can study there and never come back! I'll take care of you by myself! I'm not going! Dear! I don't think we should do this. It's my fault for raising Bank to be this way. And he made Golf... This is not your fault! If you still won't listen to me, I'll have Bank go to America instead! And don't think that you two will ever get to see each other again! Bank. Let's talk, son. Will you break up with Golf? I'm begging you. Mom... I'm sorry. Tar. - Where is P'Golf? - Didn't you get here together? Everyone. A classmate of ours will be saying goodbye, he's going to study abroad. I've just heard the news. I want to say bye to everyone. I'm gonna go study in America. I wanna thank you guys for being my friends for the past 3 years. I'll never forget, I will always remember our friendship. If I had hurt anyone of you, then I'm sorry. Tar. Jieb. Tued. Paan. I won't forget you guys. I'm not sure... when I'll get a chance to come back. I might not get to come back. So, you guys look after Bank for me, okay? Bank. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. For everything I ever did to you. I'm sorry that I bullied you. And all this time, I have never had any regrets falling in love with guy. My only regret is that we had so little time together. I won't forget about you. I love you, Bank. Goodbye, Tar. Jieb. Paan. Goodbye. I have to leave now. Why? What's going on? Give me a hug. Why are you doing this, P'Golf? I don't understand. Golf, your father is waiting. Asshole! Bastard... fucking bastard! You said that you would never leave! What am I supposed to do if you leave me! Asshole! (Eat it up so you'll grow strong. P'Thom) Bank, can you come over? Say hello to Aunt Pim and P'Arm. Hello. This is Pim, she is a friend of mine. And Arm is her son. I think you two should get to know one another.. Hello. Arm is single right now. My son is like you, dear. So if you choose to get kn... I'm sorry. But you should take your son home. I have no interest in getting to know him. Bank! Why are you being like this? Mom! Even though I am a gay, it doesn't mean I'll just date easily with anybody! (6 months later) - P'Golf! - Bank! When did you get back? Golf, did you tell your father you're spending the night at my place? Who's this? I'm Kaem, his girlfriend. We met in America. I hope you'll take good care of me. Bank! I thought you said you wouldn't have anything to do with him?! Bank! Things have gotten this bad! Isn't it bad enough that I'm like this?! And you're gonna... Because things are like this! That's why I don't want anything to do with you. Bank! It's not like that! You should stay by my side! Don't do this! - I come back for...?????? - Just stop, P'Golf! Just forget about the past. I know that you love Bank. But you need to understand that you're brothers. Don't do against nature. Why, Kaem? How is it unnatural for me to love a guy? Aren't you supposed to love someone based on how they are on the inside? Does it have to be based on gender? I don't, but other people do. Oh, Bank! Let's go eat! I'll take this for you. There is no point in running. We should just talk. Let's just go, P'Thom. Hey, come on! What the fuck do you think you're doing with my boyfriend? What the fuck is you, douchebag? Asshole! P'Thom! P'Golf! Let's go! Enough! Stop! That's enough! P'Thom, let go of him! Bank! It seems that ever since Golf come back, you two haven't spoken like how you used to. I guess I'm pretty busy, so I don't get to talk to him much. You still love him, don't you? (You are cordially invited to the engagement of Sutthisanan/Kaem and Kanthitat/Golf on Feb 14, 2013) You should find a nice outfit tomorrow. So we ca take some photos with your brother at the ceremony. Mom! Why did you stop the car, P'Thom? Oh, I just wanna talk to you about something. I want to thank you for choosing me in the end. I have something I want to talk to you about too. What is it? P'Thom, what are you doing? - Just for a little bit. - No, I don't like this. Come on, can't you let me for a bit? If you keep doing this, then I'm getting out of the car. Why, Bank? Don't you love me? Why can't you do this to me? Yes! I don't love you! What does it mean, Bank?! What's the meaning of what we've been doing then?! What does it mean?! P'Thom! Let go! Tell me! Why can't you give me this?! I love you! I've done so much for you! So why are you being like this to me?! Where have you been? I was waiting for you since morning! I even came to stay over tonight. I went to dinner with P'Thom. It's 2 a.m., Bank! Which restaurant is still open?! It's my business. Stay out of it. I'm not in the mood to talk about anything. Excuse me. Are you sure it was just dinner?! Look at yourself! It was more than dinner. - Come with me, we'll go see him now. - Let's go of me! Let go! Let me go! You had sex with that Thom, didn't you?! Don't think that everybody is like you! You had made love with me even though you didn't love me! If you really did, you wouldn't have run to live abroad! Do you think I don't love you?! Fine! I'll show you who loves you more, will be it Thom or me?! Come here! Doctor, how are my sons? You older son is in stable condition. He suffers from a broken left leg and a mild concussion. There re no trace of any brain bleed in the MRI. He's stable now, but I'll need to keep him under observation for at least 24 hours. If there are no complications, then the patient will be moved to the recovering room. But for your younger son... The patient is still unconscious. We've found that the suffers from a severe internal damage. There was an emergency surgery. If his condition doesn't improve, he will lose his life. This can't be! It can't be, Doctor! Bank! He has to live, dear! Nurse! Can I go see my brother? Golf. I don't think you should go yet. Your body's not strong enough yet. You still need plenty of rest. No! I haven't seen him in days. I think you should let Bank rest. Trust me. Please take me to see him. Why? What's wrong with my brother? Dad? What's wrong with Bank? Please give me your word that if I take you, you will be able to accept your brother's condition. Accept what? Your brother is severely injured. His kidneys are damaged and the doctor had to remove one. We're still waiting to see if the other will improve. What else? His body is currently not functioning properly. If his other kidney fails, your brother will most likely... Why didn't you tell me?! Dad! Son. It's in the past now. We... were afraid you wouldn't be able to handle it. And you were gonna fucking keep this from me?! Hello. I have news I need to tell your father. I'm wondering whether you're ready to listen it right now. Yes. I have removed one of his kidney, but his other kidney is still not functioning properly. He needs a kidney tranplant. Otherwise, we will need to be on dialysis for the rest of his life. It will greatly affect the patient's quality of life. Can you take mine, Doctor? Dad! I want to donate my kidney! Golf, calm down and think about first. Dad! I really do love him like my brother! I want to donate my kidney to him! I'm the reason he lost his kidneys! I'm the reason he lost his kidneys! Doctor! Please let me donate my kidney to him! Bank! P'Golf! How are you feeling? Are you hurt anywhere? I'm doing just fine. I'm that awesome. I worry about yourself. Why are you staring? Staring at someone cute? P'Golf! Can you give me your hand? What for? Come on. Just do it. Here. Can you promise that we'll be brothers? Didn't we already make a promise? No, that was you promising not to leave me. But now, I want us to promise that we'll be brothers forever. Yeah. I promise that we'll be brothers forever. Bank? Why are you giving it back to me? I want us to go back to being brothers like before. We are now! How are we not brothers?! I've promised you that! No. I meant that I want us to go back to being brothers. Why, Bank? What's the reason? I want the problems to end. We're still brothers. We can't be in love. No! We're not breaking up! We can be a couple! - I'm gonna go talk to Dad. - Don't, P'Golf. I can't do this anymore. Let's just stop this. I feel bad for Mom. Don't you feel bad for me at all? (1 year later) (Happy birthday, Bank. Hope all your wishes come true.) Who is this from? I'm just gonna unwrap this if you are not telling me. Bank? "How are you doing?" "You doing well?" "You are a year older now." "How are you doing in school?" "Don't study too hard or you'll get sick." "How are our friends doing?" "Tell them that I miss them for me." "Besides the ring, I have one more present for you this year." "From now on, I won't run away from you anymore." "I'll always be with you at all time." "I'm glad that I get to take part in keeping you alive... once again, without any pain." "Take care of my kidney, okay?" "Even though that by the time you read this," "I might be not alive in this world anymore." "Don't forget to take care of Mom and Dad for me." "I'll always love you, cutie." "P'Golf." Tar! What does it mean?! Didn't he go study abroad?! How could it be like this?! No, I don't want this! Bank. I'm sorry. Your parents didn't want you to know. Golf had a brain tumor. They found out after you two had that accident. He begged us not to tell you. Golf... died a few months after he was diagnosed. P'Golf. Thank you. "Maybe, some people enter your life in order to create wonderful memories before they leave." "It's hard to come to term with that whether they walk away alive or dead." "The only thing we can do is keeping that person alive in your memory as long as you can." "That someone doesn't need to always please you like a girlfriend or a boyfriend, but they can make you happy." "That someone doesn't need to cherish you like parents, but they can give you warmth." "And they're always ready to protect you." "That someone doesn't need to make us laugh at all times like friends, but they can make you smile." "That someone who you won't go into hysterics when they leave, but they'll always be in your memory forever." "I love you, P'Golf." "My Brother." -THE END-
