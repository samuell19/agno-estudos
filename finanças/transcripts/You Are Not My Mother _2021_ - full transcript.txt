Mam? Mam! Ma! Granny? Why didn't you wake me up, I'm late. Oh, sorry, love. - Can I get a lift, please? - Did you get any breakfast? Take this for your lunch. There. - Can I get a lift, please? - Ah, I can't drive today. My foot has seized up with the change in the weather. Could you grab me a towel there? I've missed the bus. What do I do? Why don't you ask your mother? It'll get her out of bed. Mam? I'm late for school and Granny can't give me a lift. What? Never mind. - I can walk. - No. No, no, no, no. I'll... I'll bring you in, okay? I'm just... Just give me a minute, yeah? I'm just going to go wait in the car. Are you going to work today? No. Is everything okay? I'm just tired. Could you go to the shops after you drop me to school? Why? What do we need? I don't know. Like, bread, cereal, milk, everything. I need... I need to get home. Mam, we need food in the house. Mam, are you listening to me? Mam! Mam! Mam! What are you doing? Mam, what is wrong with you? I'm... - Char, I'm sorry... - It's fine. I don't think I can do this anymore. What? I can't do this anymore. Go home, then. Hey, Char. Can you take a seat for me there? Quick. So, today I am returning your essays to you, girls. - Suzanne? - What, Miss? And I have to say it. The results were disappointing. It was all in the notes I gave you. Really, all you had to do was read them. All you had to do was read it. - Thanks. - It's easy as that. There was one essay, which seemed to cover all the marks. So, I've printed it off as an example of how to answer the exam question. Good job, Char. Suzanne, move. Now. Miss, I swear, you fancy me. Next to Char there, come on! And will you lose the chewing gum, please? You need some chewing gum, Miss. Rude. Now, last week we looked at techniques and interpretation. Today, we're going to do some work on pre-Christian stone carving ahead of our field trip this week. This will come up on the exam, so please take down notes for me, okay? We will look at each section... And don't forget I need your permission slips signed for our trip this week. No slip, no trip. Okay? You'll be sent to study for the day. - Ah, Miss. - Ah, yeah. Be good. This is my 2D. Thank you. Where did you get the idea for that? It was in a dream I had. How're you getting on? Good. I mean, academically you're doing great. Skipping ahead a year can be tough. You still get to see your old friends at lunch, right? Yeah. When did you last hear from her? She left to bring her to school. And then didn't come back here after. Uh, she dropped you at your school? Char. At Brigid's. When your mum dropped you off, did she say where she was going after that? No. Uh, how was the drive to school? Was she all right? She said she was tired. Hey, any word from her? Who is this? My son. Well, I was just saying to your mum there that there is not much we can do right now, as it's only been a few hours. Her car door was wide open. You don't think that's a bit fuckin' weird? What, she left her car in the middle of a field and went for a stroll? What about CCTV? We haven't checked yet, but this area isn't the most well-covered. Yeah, big fucking surprise. Do you have anyone out there looking for her? I've notified the cars that are out there, but in the lead in to Halloween, we got a lot of calls coming in. A few teenagers setting up some bonfire is more important than a missing person? Like, what if someone took her from the car? And... and brought her down. There's loads of laneways... Aaron! She was in one of her down moods. She's done this before? Not in a long time. Has she ever gone missing before? Char, um, will you go up and just try find a couple of photos of her? You know, we can go out and see if anyone's seen her later. We need recent ones. Does your mum not have an album or something upstairs in her room? I didn't look there. All right, um... You head down to the green, I'll head up towards the village. Just ask around and see if anyone saw her. Are you all right? She said something in the car today. What did she say? She said, "I can't do this anymore." Uh, she'll probably be home before we get back here anyway, you know? Yeah. Hey! - Hey, where you going? - Just going home. You weren't running off to tell anyone we were putting pallets there, were you? No. I don't know if I trust her. What did you see? You were just getting stuff for the bonfire. Mm, wrong. You didn't see anything. And you'll be telling anyone that asked that, yeah? Is this your mam? - What the fuck? - That is fuckin' weird. Can I get that back, please? I know, I know, I know. You have a drag of this and you don't cough, and you get the photo back. Fair enough. Oh! - Oh, is she gonna do it? - Oh! - Oh! - Oh! That's actually too bad. No, stop! What? Please come back. Char! That's it. It's over. My life is over. May as well just throw myself off a bridge. What is it now? Promise me you won't be mad? Katrina. How many do you usually take? Two, or I won't sleep. Right, I better head off. I have to be on the site early tomorrow. Will you be okay? We'll be fine. Right, well let me know if you hear of anything. Of course. 'Night, Aaron. I made you something. - What is it? - It's for protection. It will keep you safe. Thanks, Granny. - You should get some sleep. - Yeah. I'm just going to finish this episode. All right. Don't stay up too late. Your mother will come back, Char. She'll come back. Well, I know so. I love you no matter what. And I think you are magical. Thanks, Mum. Do you want to help me carve this pumpkin? Ugh, I don't really want to get my hands dirty. I think they taste delicious. No. Ew, it's gross. Aw. - You don't like brains? - No. Are you sure you don't like brains? Char, are you hungry? - I think you'd like brains. - No. - I think you're hungry. - No. Ah, go on! Oh, my God, look at this. Oh, it's delicious! Nam, nam, nam! I got ya. Wait a minute now. Come here, they're delicious. Mam? Hey. Get your ma a glass of water, will you? Is she okay? Yeah, she's all right. Got you that. The doctor gave her something, so she might be a little funny for a while. Does she have to take them as well? Yeah. Is she sick? Fuck! I forgot one of the prescriptions. I need to get to work. For fuck's sake. I could just go get it, if you want? Are you sure? It's that one there, um, lithium. They probably have it there, they just forgot to put it in the bag. I have to head off now, but Char has taken today off school, so she can go out and get the rest of your meds. And I'll be here with you too. I did a bit of a shop there as well... What was the name again? Um, it was for Angela Delaney. Hey. Hey. You know, I... I heard about your mam. Is she all right? Yesterday, when... I didn't know you were out looking for her, okay? You know, you can call me a dickhead, - punch me in the face, or... - Why do you care? I don't. Okay, then, can you just leave me alone, please? Suit yourself. Who's that? A girl from school. Delaney? Yeah. Why? I don't want you talking to her. Why? I said, I don't want you talking to her. Where's Mam? She's having a lie-down, upstairs. Where are you going? I have to meet a friend about your mother. I won't be long. Mam? Hey. What are you wearing? It's a dress. - You don't like it? - No, I do. Are you making dinner? Yeah. You used the pumpkin. Aaron got us that to carve for Halloween. Oh, um. No, no. It's fine. It's fine. How're you feeling? I'm good. Do you know what? I'm... I'm great. What are you doing? Dancing. You know? Why don't you have a dance? - Mam, stop. - Come on. You want to shake it? No. - Go on. - What are you doing? Stop. Do that, um, that twirl thing. Yeah, push. Like, out. Do it again, go on. Do you want to go set the table? Dinner will be ready soon. Smells nice. Sorry, love. Hello? Uh, something smells nice. Didn't know you were cooking. Lucky I brought chips. Are you not eating? The front door isn't closing properly. Needs a new latch, I think. I can call tomorrow and fix it. Those pills mess with your appetite. How long do you have to take them for? She'll take them as long as she needs to take them, Mam. Are you going to school tomorrow, Char? - Yeah, I guess so. - Uh, she doesn't have to. You don't have to, if you don't want. Actually, I've a permission slip I need you to sign. Has to be in by tomorrow, so... - Are you going on a trip? - Mm-hmm. We're going to this heritage site. And then we're off on our midterm break for Halloween. I'd love to be going on a mid-term right about now, to be honest. I think we should go away on your break. Just the two of us. Like, where? I don't know. Wherever we want. Do you not think you should, uh, stay home and take it easy at the moment? Uh, I think a break away would be the perfect rest. Yeah, but remember what the doctor said, just to try and keep a healthy routine for a while. I think it'd be fun if we got in the car, and we didn't know where we were going... You're not going away for the weekend! - Hey. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. Here, I need to give you something. What is this? It's your mam's bank card. I just don't want her going anywhere, or... I just want you to keep it safe, all right? We... we all just need to work together right now. Just make sure she'll get better, yeah? Yeah. Are you awake? Are you awake? Now, just set them down over there for me. I meant to give you this. Thank you. Who signed that for you? My mam. How is your mam? She's fine. Must've been scary for you... when she went missing? What do you mean? She wasn't missing. Look, I know it's not easy... when our parents aren't well. She's not sick. Okay. I have to go home. My door is always open for you. If you ever just want to chat. Okay? Jesus! Watch where you're going. Eh, Suzanne. Come in. - How are you today? - Grand. Made you a cup of tea. Thanks. How are you feeling today? Good. Uh, this shouldn't take long. I actually had all the parts already, so... I'm going for a walk. If that's all right? I'm allowed out for a walk, aren't I? Sure, yeah. No, of course. Uh, the fresh air would be good for you. Yeah. Did you even check properly? Yeah, we checked properly. Hello. Did you tell someone where we kept those pallets? - No. - You're lying. I'm not, I saw the council take them away yesterday. What's that on your face? I asked you a question, Char. What's that on your face? - It's a birthmark. - A birthmark? Looks like a burn to me. Do you want another one? Amanda, give me the lighter. Do you want to see something cool? Fuckin' hell, Kelly! I think you need a reminder that you're a little rat. Right in the middle of your face, to make sure you'll see it every fucking day. What the fuck is wrong with you? Fuckin' bitch. Why did you do that? Because she deserved it. You shouldn't let people treat you like that. You can't do that. Mam? Where did you go... when you left your car on the green? I can't tell you. Not yet. What's wrong with you? Hey. Nothing's wrong. Everyone's just trying to tell us what to do. You and me... we can do what we want. Used to come here with you. When you were a baby. Mam, Mam! Mam! Mam! Mam! Mam! What? Are you not having fun? Can someone help, please. Aaron, come on. Char! Char, it's Aaron! I need to call an ambulance. Hold his head. Stay with him. Do you think Aaron's gonna be okay? Mam, what are you doing? Dance with me, Char. No, Mam, stop. Mam, stop. Mam! Mam, stop! Mam! Mam! Mam, stop! Stop! Stop! Mam, please stop. Please, stop. Mam! So, as you all know, Samhain is just around the corner. Or Halloween as we know it now. Samhain is thought to mean "Summer's end," and is traditionally believed to be the marker of the start of winter months. It's a very special time. A time when the veil between our world and the other world was at its thinnest, allowing spirits to pass through. Uh, we still share some traditions with our ancestors, like bonfires, which were traditionally thought to have protective or cleansing powers. Anyone here have a bonfire in their area? A fellow threw a cat into our bonfire last year. Well... ...okay. If you follow me through here, we can go to an exhibit on the practices of early-Christian Ireland and I can... I can show you the... the structures that they built using those... You are now in a liminal space. An in-between place. Why were these sites considered sacred? These "thin places" were seen as a space between our world and the other world. In folklore, rivers, bogs, lakes, and caves are often seen as places where fairy folk could enter the human world. Or lead humans to theirs. These sites have been revered and feared throughout time. Still to this day, they are not something we fully understand. Turn that shite off. Do you see what your mam did to my eye? Have you got nothing to say? Yeah. You look like shit. Your crazy bitch of a ma should be locked up in the mental. You know, my dad... he told me that your whole family has always been fucking tapped. Ever since you were born. He said that when you were a baby... your family tried to burn you in a fire. 'Cause they didn't fucking want you. Honestly, who could blame them? The fuck are you doing, Kelly? I'm joking, Suzanne. She hasn't done anything. Leave her alone. - Her ma decked Kelly yesterday. - I said leave her alone. Oh, my God. Suzanne, relax. Okay? Fucking hell, we're only joking. Weren't we, Char? Whatever. I'm going for a smoke. - Are you all right? - Yeah. How long has your son been on lithium? What... what are you talking about? Well, we'll have to wait for his results to come back, but it appears your son had a lithium overdose. What? Is your son on any medication? No. Nothing. Well, I'd like to keep him in. For 24 hours at least, just for observation. His vitals are stable, though his blood pressure has... Do you drink? No, I don't think so. What are you doing, are you coming? Uh, yeah. You can't smoke in here. Fuck off. Okay. Inhale. Inhale deeper, you want it to go down here. You have to inhale the second time to... Let me show you. You got it? Yes! Amazing. Amazing. - Congratulations. - Thanks. I like your necklace. Thank you. My dad got it made for me a few years ago. It's a replica of the one my mam was buried in. I'm sorry. I was very young. I don't really remember much, so... How did she die? She drowned. Oh, my God. The river, it used to be a lot bigger in this estate. They tried to build over it, but they couldn't. You can still see it underneath. See? She wandered away one night. And that's where they found her. Do you miss her? I didn't really get to know her. I dream about her sometimes. Like, she's watching over me in a way. Making sure I'm not doing something too fucking stupid. What about you? How's your mam? When I was younger, she was always up and down, you know? She has these "down days," Granny calls them. But I've never seen her like this. Just... It doesn't really feel right. She's on meds, yeah? Yeah. Well, my dad, he's been on meds a long time now. And there's days where he's... he's walking around like a zombie. And then, every now and then, he's completely himself. Cracking jokes and... ...I don't know. Sometimes, she really... scares me. Family is the scariest fucking thing on the planet. You wouldn't want to come over for dinner tonight? Would you? - Never mind. - No, I would. Of course, yeah, I would. I mean, I make an excellent buffer and, parents, they just hate me. - Char. - Hi. Hey. Do I know you? Yeah, Granny this is Suzanne. She's in my school. Suzanne O'Connell. Yeah. Your mother was Adrianne? Yeah. S... Suzanne, my dear. We are having a family dinner tonight, and I think it'd be best if you went home. Well, Char actually asked me to stay for dinner. Yeah. I want her to stay for dinner. Can I talk to you in here for a minute? Do you want to go and wait in the kitchen? - Yeah. - It's just there. Delish. - Will you do this for me, Char? - No. Granny, why? I've asked her to come over for dinner. She can come another time. No, why would she come back another time, what's wrong with today? You need to leave. I'm asking you and I've never asked can anyone come over before. Suzanne! Suzanne! Suzanne! You happy now? She's gone. - Char... - What? There's things I need to tell you, Char. Is this about my scar, Granny? It's not a birthmark. No. Your mother was so young, when she had you. It was hard. But you were such a happy baby. You never cried. One night... your mother took you out for a walk in the buggy, when you couldn't sleep. When she came back... you weren't with her. She couldn't remember... where she'd been. We found you down by the river. You looked perfect. Still smiling. We didn't want to believe... it wasn't you. What do you mean? It was something else. You were swapped. What do you mean, Granny? To send a changeling back... you must bring it to a fire. You did this to me? You know what they all say in school? That this family are... are fucking crazy! And they're right. The ones that took you are vengeful things, Char. They've come back for you. It's not your mother up there, Char. - It's something else. - Mam? You know that's not your mother, Char. I know you've seen it. - Mam? Mam! - No, Char! Char! Ch... Char! Mam? Mam? Granny. Open the door. If we don't do something, we'll never get your mother back and then they'll try to take you. I need you to believe me, Char. I can't open that door until you believe me. I believe you. Don't be scared, now. It might not look like your mother anymore. She's started to change. We need to weaken her, bring her to a fire. See if she turns. Mam? No. No, no, Char. Don't touch her. No! - Granny, get off. - Listen... listen to me, Char! - Granny, that's enough! - Char! Ch... Charlotte. Charlotte! No, Charlotte. Open the door! Charlotte, please open the door. Are you all right? Char, are you all right? Char? Open the door. Open the door, Char. Oh, Char. I think it's time we all went to bed. Granny's feeling a little bit confused, Char. I am not confused! Mam. Mam! Mam! Granny! Burn it. Why is he going mad, like? Oh, my God, he's still fighting for it. Hey. What are you wearing? A costume. It's Halloween, like. What, is your dad taking you trick or treating? Fuck off. What are youse doing tonight? Are you not hanging out with your new little buddy? What do you mean? I don't know. You tell me. What's going on? We're having our own bonfire. Somewhere where they can't get it taken down. We're going there later. All right. Text me, okay? Amanda! - See you. - See you. Granny? Granny? Granny? Char. What happened? Oh, Mam. Is she dead? I'll call an ambulance. What? Char? Hey, what's up? Sorry, I really wanted... Mam, I'm just gonna go over to Suzanne's for a little bit if that's okay? I think you should stay here with me. I want to go. And what about your granny, Char? Char won't be long, Ms. Delaney. Char! I think these will fit you. Do you believe me? I don't know what I believe, Char. But I know you need to leave. Leave? - You can't stay here. - Where would I go? I don't know. But I've seen what's in that house, Char. You can't go back. Granny said that if I don't do something... ...I'm gonna lose my mam forever. She said there was a way to test it. What do you mean, "Test it"? She said... that I could bring it to a fire. Are you sure about this? Can you get it lighting? Hey! Are you looking for me? Suzanne? Suzanne? You are like a fucking thorn in my side, Char Delaney. I just can't seem to get fucking rid of you. - Where's Suzanne? - Suzanne? She said that your whole family were fucking tapped and she had to get the fuck away from you. - Speaking of which. - Stop! Stop! I think it's time we finished what your mam started. - Get off! - Get her in. Get in. Suzanne! Suzanne isn't coming back, Char. Looks like you're stuck here with us. Give me the aerosol. - Kelly. - I'll fucking do it myself. Kelly, you're not actually doing this, are you? Kelly, stop! You're not actually gonna do this? Char? What the fuck is that? Look at you. You're alone. No friends. No family. You've nobody left in this world. Except me. You can come with me. There is a place, where there is no pain. No sadness. Don't you want to see your mother again? Oh, she would love to see you. Char! Char. What are you doing? I'm your mother. You... are not my mother. Char! Run. Look, we have no reason to believe that your sister was in the structure when the fire broke out. We're still trying to figure out what happened. We searched through the rubble and didn't find anything. We haven't been able to locate her just yet. Now, uh, Char has been through quite a lot. Yeah. So we'll need to contact the Child and Family Agency. But don't worry, you know, we can help you with that. A social worker will come and make an assessment. I actually have a... a contact here. Um, she's really good and she'll be able to help you. Hi. Are you not meant to be packing boxes? Yeah, there's just a few things I want to keep. Hey. Hmm. What are you making? It's for protection. Thank you. It'll keep you safe.
