My god! Do spirits possess so much power? I don't think anyone can stand them if they are seeking revenge. Enough! we are roaming around here at night since 10 years. Have you seen a single spirit? There are no such things. Spirits? RAJU GARI GADHI 2 (RESPECTED KING'S ROOM 2) Hello! Hello! Can you hear me? I came in the morning for land registration. Not the land? Landrover? Where is that site? Uncle, that's not a site. Its a car. What are you talking? You look like the brand ambassador to black paint. -Why would I even talk to you? -Give him a big round of applause. -Hello. -Sir. Mr. Raju is waiting in the car since an hour. What's the delay with the registration? Tell me if there's no money. I will arrange the registration with someone else. It's not about the money. The third friend amongst us hasn't come yet. Yes. -Where is he? -There he is. Why are you late? We are starting a business for the first time. I went to the temple and prayed for us to be together forever. Super! Come, we are late for the registration. "One word! One path! One dream!" "We will always be together" "We are brothers from different mothers, We live by the same accord" "What else can we ask God for? This friendship is a boon to us" "Beautiful life! Beautiful life!" Thank you. "Beautiful life!" "Every minute is wonderful" "Beautiful life! Beautiful life..." "Beautiful life! Beautiful life!" "Fortune of many lives!" "Beautiful life! Beautiful life!" "We dedicate it to friendship" -What a beauty! What a beauty! -Correct. What a booty! What a booty! Soft and smooth! Hey! I can't take anymore of your weird romance. Wake up! -What are you doing? Get up! -Sorry sir. Your wife is like a sister to me. I was just! Was that a dream? You will obviously have dreams if you sleep for this long. What are you talking? This is our resort. Nobody will object us for sleeping. If the customer leaves without the billing, we will be in trouble. Go and collect the remaining balance money from room number 8. Guests and accounts is your department, Food and alcohol is my department. I will not interfere in yours business and you don't interfere in mine. -Would you touch my feet if I interfere? -Was that supposed to be a joke? -Doubt? -Remind me at night. I will laugh at it. -Enough. -Hey! Be serious. We have to work hard for the next five years. And open our branches in Chennai, Kochi, Mumbai, Dubai, London and Paris. This is our target. Before doing all that, we will open in Bangkok first. -For what? -For that. -Really? -It's legal there, you know? Do they have that too? Girls have license and boys have workouts. Superb. If we have a resort there, We can offer service to our customers and enjoy the service in free time. Easy. Isn't it? -He will not enjoy and won't let us enjoy. -Good boy. Leave him here. -Alright but my body is craving for a girl. -I too feel the same. -Let's go. -Come on. Here are the vegetables you asked for. -How much do they cost? -350 rupees. These vegetables won't cost so much, I will give you 350 rupees. Give. Money is in my shorts. Take it. Money means cash. What are you holding? The bell rang, I am going for prayers and will be right back. -You hold these vegetables. -Ok. My dear children, Lord is like a father to all of us. He had first created Adam and Eve. Dear Church Father, I have a doubt. Shall I ask? Go ahead. There was no one born before Adam and Eve? isn't that true? Jesus was born later in a manger. We happen to celebrate Christmas since then. Isn't it? -Dear. -Father. Meet me in the room after class. I will answer it for you specially. Alright. So, everyone in this world are Adam and Eve's children. So, every woman is to be respected like a sister. -Father. -Dear. if every woman is treated like a sister, where will new sisters come from? -Wouldn't that be the end of the world? -Dear. -Will you answer this in the room too? -Yes, my son. Not finding an answer to my questions would be a curse to this world, Father. Sir, where do you want me to put the coffee? Sir, where do you want me to put the coffee? Put it in Kakinada. I will fly to Rajahmundry, then take a car to Kakinada and drink it. -Isn't that better? -Alright. -Hey... Where are you going? -Didn't you ask me to keep it in Kakinada? Hey... You really don't understand humor. -Come, put that coffee on my face. -Ok. Hey... I was just kidding. Give it to my hands. -In my hands. -As you wish. -Thank you. -Enjoy. -Did you put jaggery in the coffee? -Yes. I really like jaggery. Hey... Use your brains. Who puts jaggery in coffee? Sir. Know that there is a guy like me to stop anyone from raising his hand on a woman. -Enough of your heroism. -Sir, you don't listen to me. Haven't you seen Ashwin? Look how he is dancing with those chicks. -I am watching. -Keep watching, If you waste anymore time, you would have nothing left to squeeze. Shut up. Nisa darling, You are provoking me with your dance. I will have some fun with you today. -Hey, what are you doing? -Silly question. Does anyone run in a swimming pool? I am swimming, man. -I have a class going on here. -So what? Not my problem. -Hi, Nisa. -Hi. Refreshments. Thanks. This is for Nimmi... Smoothie with less sugar. Thank you. This powerhouse drink is for the pretty Suhasini. 'Suhanisa'. -Suha... sona? -No, No, Suhanisa. -Whoever it is, you are wonderful. -Thank you. What rubbish! How can you compare apples with oranges? -Here comes the English dubbing king. -Doesn't he speak Telugu? He doesn't speak English too. That is why he failed in Engineering... I failed on purpose. -Who knows? -Because I quit, This bloody education system in India. I quit. If I studied like them, I would have ruined my career and vision. -You don't look like their classmate. -Hello Aunty. Put some water on your face and iron it. Your wrinkles would disappear. -Everyone says I'm pretty like a doll. -Do you know that? You look like a grandma. Who says you are pretty? Don't hurt me, I am still a bachelor. You look like a mother to ten. How can I believe you are a bachelor? So, just remember one thing. Everybody might be the same before law. But everybody may not be the same before biology. -But zoology is different to Anthropology. -What a statement! Hey bold and beautiful, Don't you want linda goodmen star sign. -Ofcourse you have it? -You say it. I have it. Let's get out of this shit. Come on. Bye guys. No, I can't look at his romantic feats. I will jump into this juice and die. -All the best. -Rest in peace. Cheers. What is that? Spanish fly, World's second best aphrodisiac. What does it mean? A drug to boost the lust in you. Just a drop of this and you can show stars to the other person. -To whom? -Suhanisa. Hey... Nisa is my student. Don't mess with me with all your crazy. Go away good boy. I already got Suhanisa to cancel your Zumba class and set her for a date with me Hey... You know that I like Nisa, right? -Will my car run with diesel in your car? -What? Won't we switch on lights if there is moonlight in the sky? It's the same. You love her. I lust her. I will see how you will take Nisa on a date. Even Kattappa can't stop this date. No one can stop me from dating Nisa. Smile please. Show me. -Click the three of us now. -Me? Click. Come. I'm not worthy to stand beside a beauty like you.

You are so sweet. -What is this touch? So soft. -Is it? I will show you my touch now. Nisa, Shall we discuss the book I told you about. Yes. Do you believe in Star signs? They are good for nothing, how will they know about Star signs? You are too innocent. Come on. Let's go to my room. -Why does your face look so sad? -Do we look like useless salesman? -Is that why you are sad? -Yes. I thought you are upset as he took away your girl. Correct, I should be upset about her. Stop it. I hate love stories. Nice view... -You like it? -It's beautiful. Amazing. -Here we go. -Hey. Thank you. I like this brand. -Are you okay? -Yes. I am okay. Suhanisa... You know you are quite special to me. -You are married, right? -Who told you? I googled you. Damn this google. You know Google is not actually spelled 'Google'. Minton Sarota called it so. He is the nephew of... Tell me bro. Are you married or not? I am divorced too. Didn't Google tell you that? Why? You know, Full mental torture, Psychological abuse. It's like acupuncture. Very painful, you know. No happiness at all. If you look into the past, Nisa, I am talking about my past. if you look into my life. I wouldn't even call it a marriage. -I am sorry. -Don't be. I don't want you to show me sympathy, cutie pie. I want a hug. I want a shoulder. Are you okay? Selfie trick would be better. Nisa, shall I click a photo of you? -Ofcourse... Shall I pose? -Absolutely. By the way, look straight into the lens. Okay? -Photo should be amazing. -You will be shocked. Ready? -What happened? -Lens should be clean. -Clarity is important. -Yes. Ready? Pose. Any problem? Lens needs to be cleaned. Clarity is important. Maybe this side is better. -Come on, baby. Let's take a selfie. -Selfie? I hate selfies. Hey... Let's take a selfie. Selfies are injurious to health, ma'am. Many die because of it, you know. Hey cutie pie, One selfie, Please... Nice... Where are you? -Have some alcohol. -Nothing goes in now, ma'am. With your permission, can I call my mom? You can call later. Have this first. -I miss mommy a lot, ma'am. -Drink this first. Have it. Hey... Ghost... There is a ghost in our resort. What happened? -Did Nisa leave? -Fool, That's not Nisa. It's a ghost. An aghora in the form of a girl... -Aghora? -I will show you. Come. -She looks fine. -Click a photo. You will know. See. Look, you can't see the head, right? What happened to you? Why are you talking crap? Look properly. -You can see her. -No. It's true. When I clicked earlier, I couldn't see her. So, nothing happened between you two. One minute. Did you dance? -I made dosas. Come and eat. -This isn't the time for your sarcasm. She is a ghost. She drank a full bottle earlier... Why would there be any ghosts in our resort? Come on... Let's take Nisa to her room. No, No, I will take care of Nisa. You guys do your work. Nisa... -Nisa! -Your fate! Romance with a ghost? You will be dead. Hey... there is no ghost. Don't be scared. Let's go. "Nisa... I lay my hand on your cheeks." You are so soft. I can see her well now. What happened yesterday? -Hi. -I was just thinking of you. -Why? -I typed 'Rascal' in Google. -What popped up? -Your picture. Stop mocking and listen to me. There is some mystery around Nisa. How did she know I was married? -I told her that. -You? Why did you do that? Because a married guy wouldn't have much demand. Wouldn't we buy an iPhone 8 because we have iPhone 7? Even I know this stupid comparison. Close your exit door. I have to test Nisa again. Super, Nisa. You did a great job. Hey... Ghost is coming. It's a ghost. What happened to him? Why is he behaving so weird. Nothing. He thinks you are a ghost. Ghost? My God. -You know I went on a date with him. -Sheep always believes the slaughter man. -I have to teach him a lesson. -What will you do? Do you want to date me? -What? -Will you go on date with me? Music. Hello... Say yes or no. -You have all the rights on me. -I will show you what I am. Hey Praveen, it's a dream. Let's go to the resort. -Wake up, dreamer. -Hey! Are you senseless? Why are you provoking me? What does that mean? Nisa is in a bikini, calling me. You obstructed me with a coconut in your hand. While he interferes in reality and you interfere in my dreams, When will I date Nisa and build a house. -Hey. -Yes? Though I am upset I couldn't have Nisa, I am happy that she recognized you. -Really? -I swear. Superb timing. It must be your Nisa darling. We wouldn't disturb you, Bye, Good night. -It's Nisa. -Really? Talk. Talk. Hi, Nisa darling. Why did you call at this hour? Hello, Hello, She isn't talking. You keep talking. -I will check on her. ok? -Yes, go. Nisa darling, why are you quiet? Our date is tomorrow remember? Nisa... Phone is off. Nisa is asleep. Who is speaking with him on the phone? Which cream makes your body so soft? Tell me, baby. Talk dear. -Stop it. It's not real. -Hey, Don't disturb me. Tell me which cream. -Shall I apply it on you? -What will you apply? Can't you understand what I am saying? It's not real. Wait. Not you, baby. -Express me your love through a song. -Hey, Hey. She will sing, "Would he be six feet?" Listen. "I am the shadow that follows" Didn't I tell you? I have been telling you. It's not real. Hang up. -Hang up immediately. -I can't cut the call. Hey... Come on. Let's go. Please come. You die here. 'Abracadabra'. You can't hear anything else except my voice. Take a deep breath. Exhale now. Where are you inhaling and exhaling from? Look... You asked me to inhale. I did. And then said exhale. I did that too. You should specifcally tell me from where to let it out. Hey... I am fire. That's something else. Answer us without getting annoyed. -What are the questions? -Before we bought this resort. Since Mr. Raju built the resort, have there been any shocking incidents? -What do you mean? -I mean, any suicide or murder? What are you talking, sir? If there was any suicide or murder, it would've appeared in the newspapers. Go, sir. There are no ghosts here. What happened, son? As Mr. Nagarjuna suggested, I shopped at Kalyan Jewelers. As Mr. Venkatesh suggested, she put them in Manappuram father. My head is exploding for marrying a crazy girl. As NTR suggested, apply oil to your scalp. It will be cool. Come... Apply oil to me. Stop crying. Father, Father, Sit down for two minutes. -Why did you guys come here? -Are ghosts for real, Father? -Yes. -Have you seen them? -Is there air here? -Yes father. -Show me. -Here. No, Father. When we agree there's air that we can't see. And believe there is God that we can't witness, Why don't you believe there are ghosts? when there is too much air, we switch off the fan. -How do we stop the ghosts? -How do we stop them, Father? We can't stop them. But the Lord can. This cross, where he resides, can stop them. What actually happened, son? Father, there is a ghost in the resort. We are really scared. Take me there for purification. Put it on my head as a sample and purify me, Father. I didn't even bathe out of fear. You think this is like a test drive before buying a car? Please, father. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. First listen to us, Ashwin. If you repeat this, I will forget you are my friends. I worked hard, fought at home and invested money on this resort. If we spread the news about a ghost, who will come to us? -Damn! -Sorry. We didn't think that far. Alright. Don't tell anyone about this. There is no ghost here. We won't say it out loud but there is really a ghost in this resort. Damn! I am also here. How come I don't see a ghost? Why can't I see it. -Actually... -Ashwin. That's Ashwin. Ashwin. Ashwin. Ashwin. -No... -Ashwin. -Hey Ashwin. -Where did you go? -Talk... We are scared. -Hey Ashwin. Please stay with me... Ashwin. You said there's no ghost. Look what happened now. -Don't go there. -I will be fine. Ashwin. Hey Praveen. What happened to him? -Dad called me in the morning. -What did he say? He said business doesn't suit me. He wants me to sell my share of the resort and return home. That's true. Rather than the ghost beating us up here, I would let our family do that. What do you say? I can't believe you guys. I trusted you both, fought with my dad and invested money on this resort. You guys want to sell your share and go home. My dad asked me not to come home, If my business fails. To be precise, he kicked me out of the house. Parents support us until we grow up. Friends are our strength later. If you guys also leave me, how do I live? This scene shouldn't have any more sentiment. Take this. What's this? -Cassata -Where did you get it? From our kitchen. It's been so long since we bought it. That's why I gave you guys. One minute. Hello. Bala. I'll meet you guys later. -I will freshen up and call you. -It smells like a dead rat. Yucks! -Hi, baby. -Hi, Bala. How is your business going? I think you forgot me. -I forgot you? -No chance. I can only see your face. Why don't you sit behind? -I want to see the whole of you. -What, Ashu? -Why do you always ask me to move back? -Please move. Ok. Why am I sweating all of a sudden? What are you looking at? You too... -No, Ashu. -Do it for me. Please. -No. -Just on the phone. Please. -There won't be any problem, right? -No. It's just the two of us. Alright. Hey, What happened? Nothing. You open it. Want to see everything now? Boy is in a hurry. -I can't see anything. -What? I removed everything. Didn't you see? -Really? Did you remove everything? -Yes. It might be a network problem. -I am tensed, Ashu. -Don't be tensed. I am right here. -Ok. Can you see me now? -No. I might have woken up seeing those idiots in the morning. I think they are here. I will call you back. Ok, bye. Father, this incident shouldn't come out at any cost. If it is leaked, our business will be in huge loss. We would have to beg. -Stand properly, dumbo. -Who are you calling 'dumbo'? -Yesu here... Bala yesu. -Shut up. Is this the mirror you were talking about? 'Praise the Lord in the name of almighty'. 'Praise the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ'. Watch... It will come out now. What will come out? It's just the scent you sprinkled. Hey... I am pleading you. I am scared, man. Praise the Lord in the name of God, In the name of almighty, in the name of Jesus Christ, In the name of supreme power. In the name of God, in the name of lord, in the name of the holy spirit, in the name of almighty, -This place is... -Stop it. I am listening to your prayers since then. Remove your hand. You look huge. Why are you scared? Why are you making noises from inside? You think you can scare me with your noises? Yesu... Balayesu... will rip your skin off and stitch garments with it. Stop it. Look the noise has stopped. You shouldn't plead when someone is scaring you. Hey, giant... I'm talking to you. Where's the ghost? Why doesn't it come out? Brother, Ashwin bro. Everyone left me here alone. Lord, save me... Father... Where are you going, Father? I haven't thought of it, son. Save me, Father. Son, You messed it up. You better deal with it. Don't involve me. This is not fair. Ours is a very long bond, A strong relationship... Is this the time to talk about bonds and relations? Let me go. Please. I might die, Father. I am frightened. Pray, Father... -You didn't want it earlier. -I'm asking you to do it now. -Run away. -You messed it up. Damn! What's happening in the resort? What is it happening for? This egomaniac, Informic, oblique... Is English necessary now? -Did you just slap me? -No. I gave you a French kiss. -If you speak broken English again... -How can you escape from the... -There you go again. -Good morning, sons. -Good morning, Father. -It's good days for your resort. -Really, Father? -Be ready tomorrow morning. -We will be going to a place. -Where to, Father? To meet a person who can solve your resort mystery. Who is he, Father? Since our ancestors... One from the dynasty reputed for the worship of Naga, Durga and Hanuman. He is Rudra. Why did you bring us here, Father? I don't think this will work out. May you live long! You make me feel blissful, Rudra. Being one of the most reputed mentalists in the world. And a strong believer of science, you are still following our culture and customs, which is a great thing. Master, science knows little. There is a lot more. So, no matter how updated I am, I still follow our traditions. -Someone is here for you. -Father has come? What's up Father. Is everything working out well? You think he heard us? He is a mentalist. He can look into our eyes and say what's in the heart. He is one among the top five. How is it possible, Father? Give me your phone. Look into my eyes. Just look like a normal human. Think of your password. Repeat it again and again. -Nice wallpaper. -What? He unlocked my phone. -Rudra. -Yes. What about the resort problem? There is no problem without a solution, Father. I will definitely come. Commissioner is on the phone, sir. What's the case? 10 days back, in NGO's colony, a lady by name Varalakshmi was dead. She has no one. Postmortem says it's a brain stroke. It says a piece of apple was stuck in her throat, depriving her of oxygen supply. But as her neighbors suggested her death to be unnatural, I am dealing the case. Suspecting the maids, we have them under custody. Where is he? Does anyone lie during the holy Swami observation? I am in no way related to her death. She asked me to get milk. She was dead by the time I returned. He is repeating the same since 10 days, Rudra. Is he saying it this way or saying the same thing? He is repeating it almost word by word. Then he is lying. You are hiding the truth. Commissioner, a person who's not guilty will be frustrated upon asking the same thing repeatedly. He starts to fumble. But the guilty guy will practice to not get caught. You didn't do it, right? -You didn't do it, right? -No, no. Have some water. I'm telling you the truth, I swear. What was the time when you returned that day? It must be 1'o clock. I also heard prayers from the mosque nearby. -Commissioner, when was she dead? -As per the reports, at 12:50. -Where did you get the milk from? -From a shop at the end of the lane. How many times did you practice to lie about the same thing. Yes. -You are lying for sure. -No, sir. I am telling you the truth. Trust me. Your tongue might lie but your eyes do not. According to Neuron psychology, there are two portions in the brain. Visual cortex to the left and creative cortex to the right. For example, if I ask about your favorite place, your eyes automatically roll to the left. Your favorite place is recorded there as a visual, which is real. So, you are saying the truth. But if I ask you what you would do on becoming the PM, Your eyes would roll to the right. Which means, you are accessing the creative side of the brain. That's not real. That's an imagination or a lie. You don't have to imagine if it really happened. If you did imagine, it's not true. For both the questions I asked, you looked to your right. So, you were lying. What's the truth, Rudra? Where did the murder take place? Single property with 45 acres... Four crores per acre, which is 180 crores. You will die soon. You have no kids too. -What will you do with the property. -Who are you to question about my property? -God of Death. -Sathi call the cops. You are also one of them. I thought of giving you five acers of land. You would have got five acres. But now, you have to roam around police stations and courts. What five acres? He didn't murder her but he assisted. He tried to hide the truth. As you would notice the fingerprints on the property documents, He erased the ink on his finger with hydrogen peroxide. Four people came. Five including him. They drank coffee in the joy of gaining wealth, Their fingerprints are on the cups in the kitchen. To trace the fingerprints, Check who has registered her property since her death. There is already a real estate venture board in those 45 acres. Brilliant, Rudra. This information is enough to close the case. The holy observation is for correcting our mistakes. But not to hide your mistakes. -Who is he, sir? -He is a modern saint. There are very few mentalists like Rudra in the world. They approached him to solve murder cases in America, Russia and Australia. Like mind reading, influencing, hypnotism and body language. Mentalist is a combination of many psychological theories. Is this a new kind of science? We can't say it's completely science or not. -It's a phenomenon. -Phenomenon? -Is she Nitya Menon's cousin? -Hey. Sunny aunty's new video is out. Why are we discussing it? Hey good boy... Look at your laptop. -Hey. -Shut up. -Go connect TV to Bluetooth. -I'll do it right away. You guys will never change. -Switch off that lights. -Ok. -Loading... Loading... Loading... -Loading... Loading... -Good boy say it. -Say it. Loading... Loading... Loading... -Loading... Loading... -90 percent. -Why are we seen? -Yes. It's us. Switch off that TV first. Do it. -It's not happening. -Give me. -You got a voice message. -Who would message you so late? Open it. Hey... We are not on the bed. Yes. No! Let's have a look. Sir, it's not an ordinary ghost. It is quite wild. She is driving us crazy, We slept in the church out of fear. Please help us get rid of this ghost. First thing that you should know is, a human's fear is a ghost's strength. The strength we have in humans, is 10 percent after becoming a ghost. I don't know the truth. But It sounds great, sir. It's encouraging, I like it. -What do you think? -Encouraging? It's discouraging for me as my bladder is going to explode. No out going. Sir, I'm really sacred. Half of our fears come from not knowing the truth. In fact, I am using the word 'ghost' so that you will understand. According to me, it's an invisible energy. -Energy? -Yes. The thoughts left after a human's death is the 'Invisible Energy'. -Seems like a network problem. -Wait. -Sir... -Don't do it. It's here. It's right here. Ghost? Yes. Who are you? Why are you here? Speak out. Are you scared to come infront of me? How long will you hide and scare people? Come, stand in front of me. Sir, is it necessary to call madam now? I am already shivering with fear. You need not fear. It doesn't have the power to attack us. Sir? What happened sir? Sir. Please speak out sir. She got into you, Is she more powerful than you? Who is that ghost, sir? A girl. A girl's spirit. That spirit is with revenge. It seeks vengeance. Against whom? Who is she? What's her story? We don't understand our situation, sir. We fought with our parents to invest on this resort. I stopped them from selling it. We wouldn't even get half the price if we sell now. We don't know what to do. For solving your problem and the mystery in this resort, All you have to do is introduce me to Suhanisa. Even he wants Suhanisa? Calm down. Let's do some magic, ok? I will touch Praveen on the cheeks. But Siri will feel my touch. -Are you ready, Siri? -Yes. I am ready. -Did you feel it? -No. Close your eyes. -Did you feel it hard? -Yes. -You shouldn't have lied then. -I'm sorry. -What happened? -He beats you, she feels it. -Crazy experiment, man. -You mean, 'Interstellar'? 'Gravity' man. How did Siri feel it when you hit Praveen. We all know twins feel each other's pain. All of us also have such connection. But how do you know Siri and Praveen are connected? It's magic. -Coffee? -You tell me, Will I have coffee with you or not? Look into my eyes. Yes, You are ready for hot coffee. Let's all become mentalists. We will be left as bachelors otherwise. -What do you mean by that? -I don't know, just said it in flow. Hey. There is something special about you. Something in those eyes... Let's take a picture? No. -Later. -Now. -Later. -Right now. -No. -Go sit there. Nisa, there's an expression called 'smile' in life. Familiar with it? Nice. Why aren't they here yet? -They are coming. -They are here. -I'll see you again. -Sure. Touching again... -Bye. -Bye. -What happened inside, sir? -Did you find out about the ghost? Yes. Suhanisa is not the ghost. Then, who is the ghost sir? Wait and see. Fool! Why do you yell for everything? It's you? What's that powder on your face? -New technique to avoid ghosts. -Technique? -How do ghosts look? -Pale... If we too look pale, they think of us as fellow ghosts and ignore. That is why I wore gloves and applied powder on my face. -Idea is brilliant. -Powder is there. Enough of your chuckling... It's ghosts time, Let's go sleep. If we sleep when they are roaming, they might notice we aren't ghosts. -That is why we applied powder. -Yes, right. Come. Nothing. Who are you, sister? You said she wouldn't recognize us with the powder. Actually, it was his idea, madam. -I just executed it. -Idiot... You blame me for everything. Sister, it was not even my idea. It was Yesu's idea. Thank god! She left. Sleep now. Even with so much tension, I feel Suhanisa is beside me. -It's not Suhanisa. -Then? It's the ghost in Suhanisa's body. No matter how many times you disturb me, I will keep drawing. Who are you? You are afraid to show your face. You must have made some mistake. I wanted to help you as you are a girl and you are attacking me. I don't care who you are. Why should I bother? Go to hell. Can I turn? Why did you want to meet so early, Rudra? Ashwin, Kishore, Ravi. Your opinion about them? I didn't know them earlier, But I've been watching them since they bought resort. I can say they behave like boys but are not bad people. -Do you know that girl? -No sir. Tell me the truth. You would know from our eyes if we were lying, sir. Do you have an affair with anyone other than your wife? Sir, there's nothing between my wife and me. My happy ending is still pending. -What about you? -I have nothing to do with his wife, sir. -Hey. -It's true. -Weren't you a professional hacker earlier? -Yes, sir. I was working in the cyber security wing for a major company. -You said you had a girlfriend. -Yes sir, Her name is Bala. But I never met her directly. We talk on Skype. I am still a virgin. You can check if you wish. What will they check? Checking? Hey morons. What does morons mean? Do you know why the ghost is scaring only you three in this resort? Three of you had bad thoughts about girls at some point of time. It might be Nisa, Bala or Sunny Leone. Stop it now atleast. -What does morons mean? -Fools. Basically, it's a word originated from Greek. Greek country... I shouldn't teach English to barbarians like you. -Talk about Greek... I can't, man. -Correct. You should know Greek for teaching us. Get lost, moron. -Why is the door open? -What are you doing here, chaps? Say that again and you are dead. You eat those first. I asked you not to come here drunk. Are you Supreme Court judge to tell me? You look like a cornhusk doll clicking selfies. -Talk more and I will stab you. -Stab me? -Spices would be better. -You are waking up the animal in me. A pig can't do much after waking up. -I will look for the right time and kill him. -Hey! -There's no time, my friend. War or surrender? -Shut up. These dialogues won't make you a hero. So much attitude? Attitude is in my body and heroism is in my house. Sugars are in peppermint. Let's fight. -Then Waiting... -Waiting for what? Hey... You said waiting... I believe that you didn't do anything wrong. You doubt that I might do something wrong. Belief and suspicion can't exist together. That is why I am erasing you from my thoughts. Nice not to have met you. Goodbye. I am... Amrutha. Who? Why? What did they gain? -Dad. -Yes dear... Why is everyone greeting you? Is it because you are the Head Master? Respect doesn't come from some post. But from our behavior and morals. 'Though revenge is sought from the enemy'. 'Though revenge is sought from the enemy'. 'Do no harm once he surrenders'. 'Do no harm once he surrenders'. 'Be kind and let him go'. 'Be kind and let him go'. -What's your ambition in life? -I'll become an engineer, Master. I'll become a doctor, Master. Amrutha, what about you? -I'll become a lawyer, Master. -Why? I will make him stand in court what mistake have I done to take my mom away from me at such a young age. No father... Baby girl, today is Bhogi festival. You should take a head bath. -I will do, dad. -You are a kid. You might get the liquid into your eyes. -I'm a grown up now. -I will not undress infront of you. I am shy. Why are you so stubborn? How do kids grow up without the father looking at them? What's the meaning of the poem you said in the school? 'Though revenge is sought from the enemy'. 'Do no harm once he surrenders'. It will reflect your greatness, goodness. Why do you like the basil plant so much? I don't know, dad. But when I am with it, Feels like I am with mom. I will light it, I will light it. Don't be sad that mom isn't beside you, dad. Your baby girl is right here to take care of you. Master is here. It's you, sister... -What are you guys doing? -We are studying well, sister. One of you, Recite a rhyme to me then. I will say it, sister. The same old Telugu poems again. I will teach you a new English rhyme today. Ok, sister. "A for Apple, B for Bat" -Dad, Dad, Dad -What are you doing? You said no to Telugu poems and teaching them English rhymes in my house? Do sit ups. Do it. What's wrong in teaching English rhymes, dad? Nothing wrong in learning English, Ignoring Telugu is a mistake. The melody in Telugu cannot be found in English rhymes. That is why there's a saying, 'Telugu is the best among the national languages'. Next is Amrutha. She is the most brilliant student of our university. She will reach the highest point in this profession. Nice to know about you. So tell me... you have got a civil, a criminal and a money laundering case. How would you deal with each one of them? Your honor, it is my finding that any case can be solved with just three questions. Who? Why? What did they gain? Who? Why? What did they gain? For not repeating yesterday's mistake, it has to be stopped this moment. Only lawyers can make it possible. -See you. Happy journey, Nisa. -Thank you. Nisa, I miss you. Baby, I am just going to Mumbai. You can come whenever you feel like. Give me one second. We won't get a seat on the flight right now. It's alright. I will stand. So sweet! What about me? Will you believe that I am not the ghost? Stop using that Spanish fly first. Let's think about it. -Bye guys. -Bye Nisa. Hey, Who told her about the Spanish fly? I told her. Sufferings are personal. Let me suffer. Why do you interfere? Suffer then. Come on. -Bye. -Bye Nisa. Learn to act according to the situation. You are always annoyed at me. What else do you expect? Why do I even care? Hey, Why is our door open? Sir, what are you doing here? -It happened here. -What happened? It happened here. -This is our bathroom. -She was treated unfairly right here. That is why she is looking here for answers. -Is she here now? -Who is that girl, sir? She is Amrutha. Topper of India's finest law college. When she came here last year for a college trip with friends, This incident happened here. She committed suicide four days after that incident. This is too much, sir. Does she have to commit suicide for such petty things? Correct. It is petty for someone who watch porn on the Internet like you. But it's a huge deal for a girl raised by her father alone. Everyone saw it anyways, Why don't you show me in private? You don't know how the family is mentally affected with such incidents. You don't know the pain they feel when the society frames them to be guilty. Look at her skin, man. -It is so smooth. -She is his daughter. When he can't raise his daughter well, what will he teach at school? They are people with no shame or embarrassment. Let's go. What is this, Master? It is not fair that she has to go through this. She will not make a mistake. She will not make a mistake. This girl! Her mom died as soon as she was born. She now took her dad's life. -Her existence doesn't matter anymore. -Yes. Dad, I was strong with you by my side. Get up dear, Get up. Pity on her, sir. Who wanted to hurt a girl like her? I don't know. But she is very special. She deserves the answers. Who? Why? What did they gain? What is it, sir? Amrutha's death investigation? She had a hot body. She wasted it. Why would she die just because everyone saw her? People like us enjoy only when girls expose. What do you say? Being a guy, you are feeling shy. Think about the pain she must have gone through, being a girl. You need a mother to become a son, A sister to become a brother, A wife to become a husband. And basically a woman for you to be born. You can't even respect her after death. Your life has no value. Remember one thing every time you have wrong thoughts about a girl. There is a mother in every girl you see. Idiot. I spoke to the Vice Chancellor, Rudra. I called all the students that were with Amrutha at the resort. Everything is prepped for the investigation. Ok. Amrutha is a brilliant student. She was like my daughter. I am proud of her. If the people responsible for her death aren't punished, They would become a big threat to the society. As a lawyer, I don't like to let them go. Law can be delayed but not denied. That is what we teach our students here. Is it necessary for our college to get into such nuisance, sir? What the court and police couldn't find, can he do that with mentalism? He has done it in the past. -Shall we? -Yes. Madam has an affair with sir. Sir is showing interest to continue it. But madam has no time recently because her husband returned from Dubai. How does he know? Why are you asking me? How would I know? -Why did they keep so many cameras? -To shoot a Bigg Boss episode with you. Hey! Have some common sense. Cameras are used to click pictures. No one will attempt to click you. Wait for a moment. Did you forget? Nisa first clicked a selfie with me. So the problem began there. We should kill you first. Don't remind me the flash back. My bladder will be blocked. Alright, but I am unable to figure out what Rudra is going to do here. Sir, if you stay silent, I can do my work. Hello Mr. Operator, when the situation is violent, I cannot be silent. I need a coolant now and you need a deodorant. Got it? -What did you say? -Welcome back to 'Na' TV. He is Sarath Chandra. Commissioner of Police! And this is Mr. Rudra. A mentalist. Please. Let's get to the point. You all must remember your classmate Amrutha from last year. One of you is definitely the reason behind her suicide. And I know. The criminal is really intelligent. That is why he escaped the police investigation. But he cannot escape today because... I can read your heart. I can read your mind. Play all the reactions. Shock! She can leave. Sad! He can leave. Tensed! He has to stay. Found him. Stay. Leave. Stay. Stay! Leave! Leave! Leave! Stay! Stay! Stay! Leave! Stay. Stay. Send everyone except these 12 people. -No doubt! I am damn sure it's him. -How do you know? Future mentalist here. Were you ever so angry on Amrutha that you wanted to kill her? What are you saying, sir? Amrutha is like my sister. Ok, leave. She is very service-oriented. Very gutsy! But I didn't expect her to commit suicide. I didn't expect for this to happen to Amrutha. She is a really nice person. -Fool, That's my hand. -Sorry. Were you and Amrutha roommates in hostel since the beginning? No. After the first semester, Dad asked me to shift to Amrutha's room. -Daddy? -She is my daughter. Kiran. You can go. One second. -What's your boyfriend name? -Boyfriend? -I don't have one. -Kiran, you are lying to me. What nonsense are you talking? You are suspecting my daughter's character. Sir, please! We are trying to solve a case here. Who was it being so close to you the other day? He is Nandu, my classmate. -Classmate? -Yes. Why didn't he come here then? He didn't go to the tour with them. You only asked for the people who went to the tour. Commissioner, I need to speak with Nandu. Why him? He didn't come to the tour. -What's the password? -That's personal. Personal? He's a mentalist. Ashwin. Your name is Kiran. You could name the password as 'K'. But you didn't. Your dad is Chandra Sekhar. You could have it as 'C' but no. You set it as 'N'. Why is that? Because! 'N' stands for Nandu. Do you like Nandu? Yes. What about Nandu? That's it. You are just a friend to Nandu. The reason is Amrutha. This. -It's here. -Forgot it? You didn't get the 'Pratibha' scholarship you aspired for. The reason is Amrutha. You didn't receive much appreciation from your dad. The reason is Amrutha. She is the most brilliant student of our university. Thanks. You were roommates with Amrutha even at the resort, right? So what? Will you take us through what happened that day? Sorry. I forgot. You got the 'Pratibha' scholarship after Amrutha. I know your memory isn't so weak. Tell me. While everyone was at the campfire that day, I came to the room to charge my phone. I watched TV for a while, had a bath. As I was dressing up, Amrutha came into the room. She said her head hurts and she would take a shower and rest. I asked if she wanted any medicine. She said no and so, I went back to the campfire. -That's all. -Good. Good. Now, tell me everything you said in reverse. What? Come on, sir. This is harassment. Sir, please. -What does he mean by reverse? -From the end to the beginning. She is so finished. I got changed, Slept, Watched TV later, had a shower, Charged my phone, Asked Amrutha! Proven fact in criminal psychology. 89 Percent criminals fail trying to lie in reverse. And your eyes clearly suggest that you are lying. Give me your hand. Shall I tell you the truth now? While you were charging your phone, you got a call from Nandu. When Nandu asked about Amrutha instead of you, you couldn't take it. You decided to do something to Amrutha. You then had an idea to shoot Amrutha's video. You immediately pressed 'record' and placed it in the bathroom. Amrutha took a shower unknowingly. You edited that video and uploaded it. You acted innocent and showered sympathy on her. You acted like you are consoling her. She couldn't find out your betrayal. She couldn't take her fathers death. I pity Amrutha. She did nothing wrong. You are the reason for her death, Kiran. No, no. My daughter wouldn't do that. You are completely wrong. I didn't come here to wrong a girls character. Look at this. Daddy. I resign her from this institute. Let her face the law. Law will take it's own course. Daddy. You made a mistake, Kiran. A huge mistake. You didn't just kill Amrutha, But also her dreams, ambitions and character. Above all that, you killed her father. -What did you gain? -What did you gain? You took me away from my father for a dead girl. I will see your end. If one doesn't have a mother, we can form a bond by calling someone 'mother'. But once the word 'dad' is taken away, No matter how hard you cry or how loud you yell, It doesn't come back. Because, The word 'dad' only belongs to the father. You've taken that away from me. What do I do to you? I assured him I would show him to the world. When everyone around him was killing his trust on me, He was in agony. Who will answer to that? The body I hid from my dad by blindfolding him. You have easily exposed it to everyone. Why should I forgive you? Amrutha, I made a mistake. I was ignorant. Please leave me. When you want to live and someone is killing you, Depriving you of your breath, When death approaches you. You have to know how terrifying that is. Please save me, Rudra. Please save me. A girl child cannot study what she wants, Can't wear the clothes she likes. Can't marry the guy she likes. She doesn't even have a life. I had everything but you didn't let me live. What was my mistake? Amrutha, please! I made a mistake. Forgive me. Women have no safety from men. When she doesn't have safety even from other women, Where does she live? Even until the last moment when my head touched the floor, I wanted to live. But there was no chance, Now there is no reason. What did you gain? Amrutha, please don't kill me. -Please spare me. -Why should I spare you? 'Though revenge is sought from the enemy' 'Do no harm once he surrenders' 'Be kind and let him go' 'Hey Vemana, beloved of the universe! Listen to me!' 'letting your enemy go, even if he surrenders for you to seek revenge' Your greatness, kindness and morals lie in the fact of letting your enemy go, ?World is a beautiful place, Very good place. People are all good. Why did you lie to me, dad? He didn't lie, Amrutha. You just didn't come across truth. You don't need courage to die. But to live, you need a lot of courage. You didn't' have courage so, you jumped to death. I didn't jump and die. I died and then jumped. I couldn't breathe not knowing how to face my life. -So I jumped. -That's life. Life always tries to defeat us. That is its nature. Winning is life. Instead of looking for a 100 reasons to die, look for a single reason to live. You can win your life over. Our birth itself begins with victory, Amrutha. A baby struggles in the mother's womb with congestion, darkness and fluids. A baby struggles for 9 months. What's our struggle compared to that? The baby faces it all and thrives to live. But doesn't stop breathing. God doesn't promise anyone a life without problems, Amrutha. Life is a package of everything. We should learn to overcome it. When we are hurt, we should make sure the responsible person knows it. You let Kiran know your pain. Be peaceful from now on. Weak people can never win. Because victory is a quality of the strongest. Forgive Kiran. Your dad might already be arguing with God about the pain you are going through. Doesn't he need a lawyer like you to argue? Yes. You told your teacher already that you would pull God into the court. You have that chance now. Get him. Don't leave him. Ask sternly. Ask him what he was doing until we had to remind people about humanity. Ask him why there are situations where the heart is to be reminded of love. Will you ask? What is it, baby girl? People these days don't help each other. But you helped a spirit. How can I repay you? Now go to your dad happily. He has no worries. He was doing Zumba on land earlier. He is doing it in water now. He might do it in air later on. Excuse me! Will you click our family picture, please? Hello, brother! No photos allowed. No selfies allowed. By the way, where is Rudra? Yes, where is he? Subrip: Pix
