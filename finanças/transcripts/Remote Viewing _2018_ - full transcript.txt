[pigeon coos] [footsteps crunching gravel] [owl hooting] [ominous music] [crickets chirping] [heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] [heavy breathing] [suspenseful music] [growling] [woman screams] [muffled screams] [Attacker] Shut up or I'll slit your throat. [woman moans] - [Houston] Stop! - Why don't you yell cut like every other director in the world? - [Houston] Because it's digital and there's no film to cut. - [Shepard] Get that light outta my eyes. - [Houston] And why aren't you wearing the blue sweatshirt like you're supposed to? [owl hooting] - Why didn't you tell me that earlier? - [Houston] Because we don't have a wardrobe girl, that's why. - We don't have hair, or makeup, or wardrobe. - [Houston] Hey, you wanna grab this? - [Josh] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - The whole Freudian psychological thing, why the rapist is even attracted to his prey wearing these blue sweatshirts, is because of, uh. Shepard, explain it to her, please. - Well, he's attracted to blue because-- - Because his father wanted to punish him by drowning him in the swimming pool? - [Shepard] Very good Heather. If you knew that, why didn't you wear the blue sweatshirt? - [Joey] That is a good question. - Oh, are we still filming? - Yeah, well this is gonna be good for the documentary behind the scenes, making of, you know. Always film, always film. That was the last shot of the evening and I think it was good enough. I just have to figure out another psychological thing for the, another viewpoint, another. Got it. I got it, red ticks him off because it reminds him when he was just like a little two-year-old kid and his insane parents would abuse the heck out of him by force feeding him bottles-- - Bottles of ketchup, ketchup so he would vomit red everywhere! - I like that, that's it, good. Okay. - Genius, Joey. - So, listen, I think we did good work. Let's like call it a night. That's a wrap! Let's just get the lights packed up, the bags. Come on, let's get outta here. - Why don't, why don't you just turn this into a biography about me? - [Shepard] Should we ditch the other guys? [gentle music] - My shins hurt. My shoulder hurts. Did you have to bang me so hard? - I'm sorry, I just wanted it to be realistic. - Yeah? [engine revving] Realistic enough for you now? - [Houston] All right, come on down. Straight ahead, get a nice shot. Closer, walk to, a bit forward. Get the nice foreground leaves here, that's good. Dutch it a little bit, Dutch it. Get it scary, Dutch it. - Da-na. - More, more. - Da-na. - [Heather] I thought you wanted to stay away from the typical horror music? Besides, we can't afford the rights to that anyway. - [Houston] Where's Joey? Come on, dude. - Come on, sexy. - Hi, Joey! - How do you get it to do that? - It actually balances on a few grains of salt. - Do you guys ever stop filming? Addicts! - Filmmaking is kind of like an arranged marriage. You never really know what you're gonna get. - Yeah, especially if you were to marry you. - You wish. - Ooh, fighting words. - Am I being a bitch? - Yeah, but we're used to it so we still love you. - [chuckles] Yeah, well, men are bastards. - [together] Not us. - Maybe it's just that I'm on my moon. - [together] Tell us about it! - No! [exaggerated whining] - Sexual tension. - [Houston] Yeah. [soul music on the radio] [quarter clattering] Wow. 1896, is that the oldest one you have? - Uh, I think I might have older. Heather. - What? - Ever seen one of these babies? - No. - This is a Morgan Silver Dollar. Now, George Morgan was an assistant engraver in the Philadelphia Mint and he wanted to represent the Liberty differently, rather than the usual Greek-style figures, right? So he decided to use an American model. Enter Anna Willis Williams from Philadelphia. Now, after five sittings he decides that she had the most perfect. What the heck? Heather, let me see your profile for a minute. Come on in here. Lean in, would you, something curious. Wait a second, look at that. As I thought, it's a perfect profile, Heather. Just like the silver dollar. - [Shepard] I don't know, I think it looks more like Joey. [laughing] You guys are precious. - [Houston] Now, Heather, I would like you to hold on to this as symbol, as metaphor that you're so perfect. - [Shepard] Normally, we'd use a treasure chest filled with those. - A hundred years ago, I was the perfect woman. - Dude, Shep, you're dad is a killer with the ladies. - If only the women knew that. - Is everyone eating here paying today? - [Houston] Beautiful. - Alright. Okay, thank you for everything. Only thing, the tip is on you guys. Thank you, guys. You have another nice day, okay? - How we doing this? - [Houston] The old credit card routine. - But you're broke, Houston. - Yeah, but I got big visions. [upbeat music] ♪ From the dark and magic spaces ♪ ♪ Drifting on and navigating through the corridors ♪ ♪ Of sunlight in the country of your own mind ♪ ♪ Won't you tell me that you need ♪ - [Shepard] Look at this sweet, panoramic shot. - What are you doing, dude? - [Shepard] Dude, get out of the way. - I don't wanna kiss you, dude. - [Shepard] Dude, what are you? - Let's go, boys. [Joey laughs] Crazy class starts in five minutes. - Yeah, what are you teaching today? - You see what I have to put up with with these two? - Look out! - So, will this help me find treasure? - Well, to be honest with you, it depends on your ability. You might be able to, perhaps, perhaps not. - [Shepard] Dad, this things wobbling like a drunken sailor. I'm gonna ditch it. - Well, try the counterbalance. - I did. - Alright, do you. The alleged psychic ability to perceive an object beyond the realm of ordinary senses or science. This is called remote viewing. Training to use our minds like radios. Tuning into the unique electromagnetic signals that emanate from every object or individual. - As long as it helps us find treasure, eh? - Down with that. - Woo! [women laughs] - Out of curiosity, has anyone found any treasure? - [Houston] Anybody wanna answer that? Go ahead. Elizabeth, tell 'em all about it. - My diamond ring, I lost it, I couldn't find it for weeks, so I did the remote viewing and did a drawing of what I thought looked like a vacuum cleaner, but I didn't think it'd be in the vacuum cleaner since the housekeeper changes the bag every week, right? But I kept on drawing that same image. So, I know it was in vain, but I had Seymour, my husband, take apart the vacuum cleaner and, believe it or not, he found the ring stuck in the inside mechanism before it even reached the bag. - Wow. - Whoa. - That would explain why it had such a whistling sound. - [Houston] Whoa, what do you make of that, okay. - Brilliant. - Cool, huh? - Anyone wanna do an experiment? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. I want you all to relax, close your eyes. Relax your mind, breathe. Let images come through your consciousness. See what kind of textures you see or colors. And when you're relaxed, in a minute or two, you're gonna open up your eyes, start drawing lines, arms, whatever seems to illustrate your vision. It might be the object in its totality. Find a space that has no significance. Okay, so take a moment and when you're ready, we're gonna do this. And when you come outta your trance, I want you to start drawing. [pencils scratching] [solemn music] [pencils scratching] Okay, boys and girls, unbeknownst to anyone, including myself, except for Sang manning the projector in the back. And say hello, Sang, to the group. Say, hello. - Hello, everyone. - He's the only one that knows what the projected image is gonna be. So I'd like to see what you guys have drawn from your consciousness. Let's see what you got. Ah, funny face, hamburger. Is that communism there? Mm, she's gotten something on her mind. Take a look at this, Shepard. [Houston chuckles] Very nice. And, Sang, hit it! What do we got? [group expresses disbelief] Whoa, look at that, not quite. What, where you going? Where you going? - [Woman] Fucking bullshit. - You're a joke. [women chattering in foreign language] - [Houston] What're you girls saying? - She think you're a fake and she want her money back. - [Houston] No, hey. - I want my money back! - [Houston] We're just beginning, we have-- - No! - But we are only beginning. - I want my money back! - But wait, we still have to practice. - [Woman] No! - I would like to have my money back, too. I'm gonna get my baby daddy. Gonna beat you down! - No, no, no, no, no. You don't wanna get him over here. - Professor Houston? - Yes. - More like Professor Useless. - [Houston] I'm sorry. - I believed in you. - I did, too! You don't believe in me any more? What's going on here? - Don't quit your day job, Professor. - But this is my day job. What is he talking about? - You're one step away, buddy. I know people. - But I didn't finish the class. - Yes, yes! I have my proof, I'm going to the news! You're so going out! I got my proof! - Oh, boy. No, not Elizabeth, not you. Elizabeth. - I'm sorry, it's not working. - What about the ring? What are you talking about? - I don't trust anymore. I think he's seeing that Amazon bitch at work behind my back. I thought he took the ring to give to her, so I gave him an ultimatum and told him if he didn't give me back the ring, I was gonna give him the worst divorce of his life and sue his ass! - Well, how many times was he divorced? - None. - Wow. - I bet you he made believe he found the ring in the vacuum cleaner. Sorry, Houston. - Oh, I'm sorry myself. - There goes the redhead. - Liz, that the hell is this legal mumbo jumbo crapola? What, you think you can just walk out on me? Me, huh? What, you got some big hotshot lawyer? You're gonna take half of what is mine! My freaking money, mine! I slave my balls off down on them docks! No fricking way. I'm not taking anymore of your Liz, biz, bull crap anymore! Let's see this goddamn ring. This thing is mine, this ring. This is not gonna be paraded around on your unready fingers. I got plenty of other younger, prettier little fingers out there just waitin'! - You know what? You just take that ring and wrap it around your dick! 'Cause it would fit loosely! - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah! - Yeah? - Oh yeah. - You're pathetic! You freaking call off your lawyers or I will burn down the house with you in it! [Elizabeth laughs profusely] Oh, that's funny? You find that funny? Then, they're gonna find your charcoal body somewhere down in the goddamn ditch! [Elizabeth laughs heartily] What the hell, are you filming this? [smashing] - Alright, no problem. I'm all right. I just may be a little puffy under the left eye. Or was it the right eye? I don't know but I'm a little concerned about the lens. Make sure the camera's okay, would you? - Yeah, the camera's okay. - I'm worried about Elizabeth. - Oh, don't worry about Elizabeth. They have this sick codependency. They fight like this all the time. They go home and they make crazy sex together. Hanging from the chandelier, she told me so. - Ooh, that's kinda special. - No, but I'm really glad that you guys were filming that even though it was dangerous. - Remote viewing is bullshit. - [Houston] What are you talking about? - A breast? A penis? Do yourself a favor and everybody else here and just drop it! - I guess she's angry. - What did you draw anyway? Houston, what is this? - I just jotted down what I saw. - It's the same. - Dad, it's exactly the same. You didn't know the target. - No. - [Shepard] Sang. You picked randomly, right? - Yes. Picked out the trace from hundreds of slides. Here, check it out. - [Shepard] It could have been any of those. - Yeah, how could you have known? - Well, you know, that's the strange, weird thing about remote viewing. - Why'd you crumple it? - Angry. Wondering why nobody else ever gets it right. - You've done this before? - Yup. - This accurate? - Yeah, that's why I figured I'd give a class on it. - I thought you were just making this up to rip people off and make a living off of it. - Then I figured it was a very interesting premise that we could do a good docudrama on, as well. - Hm. [suspenseful music] Supposedly, if you let your conscious mind relax using systematic protocols, you can see your target anywhere in the universe no matter where, no matter the distance, no matter the time. - Can you see the future? - [Houston] There were a couple times where I wasn't sure. - Look, there's all sorts of stories here of people finding lost items using remote viewing. During the Cold War, the CIA associated with SRI they find a secret remote viewing research called Stargate Project where psychics were able to view and describe a new class of Soviet submarine. - The Government did this? It must be real. - Unless it's coincidence looking real. I never could tell if it's my mind playing tricks or not. I used to be getting these tantalizing images, too. - [Heather] What kind of tantalizing images? - Treasure. [soft rock music] [owl hooting] - [Joey] Okay, so you actually want the voice recorder in a shot like this? - I think that we need more incense. - No, that's okay, Joey. - No? - [Shepard] What do you got so far? - Nope. Still nothing. I gotta turn some lights on so I can see better. - I just lit the candles. - I know, but you're not actually lighting the room. [balls striking] - Helping with the mood. - [Joey] Yup. - [Houston] I need some quiet. - It's alright, Dad. Are you getting anything yet? - No. - This stuff smells terrible. - We have Japanese, Native American, and we've got Tibetan. Do you like spicy? - No, I don't need any of this stuff. I just need to quiet my mind. - [Shepard] Do you want us to leave then? - No, I want you to film this as it happens. - If it happens. - Thanks. - Come on, Heather, give my Dad a shot. Take a look at the images here, I mean. Way too many reoccurring themes of treasure and the same chest up in the classroom. I mean, the jewels, this all just, it can't be coincidence. And kinda creeps me a little a bit. We just need the location then we'll go find it. - Maybe it's in a museum. - Yeah, maybe it's in Pirates of the Caribbean. - Maybe, come on, guys. Maybe it's actually real and it's just out there waiting for us to come and get it. It's like I can hear Billy Crystal saying, "Come and get me, come and get me, come and get me!" [Heather laughs] - Yeah, maybe we should call it a night because, I'm sorry, I just can't get anything. - Sorry kids. - [Joey] I think you were close. - I'm gonna go get 40 winks. [Heather laughs] - Well, you heard him, boys. Nighty night. [crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [thrilling music] [crunching] - Hey, Shepard. Shepard? - [Shepard] Hm? - I've got a blueprint for the site. - What? - Take a look at this, come here. I gotta take the 405 South. Whereto, I don't know? - It's this chart. - Yup, I also drew this section of a map. Take a look at this. X marks the spot under the haunted tree. What that exactly means, I don't know, but. - Well, it can mean anything, it can be anywhere. There's no street names. - There's something else, take a look at this. - Are you kidding me? Is that a dead body? - Shh, you're gonna wake him up. - What dead body? - What dead body? - You guys scared the shit out of me. [clattering] - If that is a dead body, then the only question is did it die from natural causes? - Or was it murdered? - I don't wanna go with you guys, that's it. - You're just gonna give up on the $100 million? - How do you know it's $100 million? - Well, I'm just figuring. One diamond the size of a strawberry, that's an easy million. The chest is filled with more of emeralds and rubies and doubloons, easily. - Could be way more than that. - Could be costume jewelry. - Hey, believe whatever you want, but you gotta see this. Real fortune, bonified, blood red colored gemstone, diamond, gold symbol Au number 79. I looked all this up. It's mineral composition's and it's atomic numbers and it's all completely accurate. - Really? - Dad, there's no way you could've known that. - Okay, what are we waiting for? Let's go! - I don't wanna go! - Wha? Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. - Okay, fine, go. Just bring me back a pearl necklace. - Alright, let's go. - Let's go search. - You're gonna go on a witch hunt at 12:30 at night? - We have to get out of here! We don't want anyone else digging it up first. - A dead body? You're gonna dig up a dead body right now? This is ridiculous. Okay, guys, this is me recording all by myself. You wanted to record everything so I'm recording this evening. By myself. [thrilling music] - [Joey] Dude, what's that? - It's a moose call. [horn blowing] - What was that? - Yo ho, yo ho. - [Joey] Oh, hey, hey, hey! Trying to get us sued? [door creaking] - Watch the lyrics. - Come on, guys. We've got treasure to find. - [Joey] that's more like it. - Hey, look who we got here. - [Joey] Oh, I thought you weren't coming? - $100 million, you bet I'm coming! [Heather laughing] [knocking] - Hey, hey, Heather. - Yes. - So, you're coming now? - Yes. - That's cool. We're still splitting it three ways though. - Ah, it depends who finds it. - Get in there. - [Shepard] Oh, we're finding it. [engine revving] - [Houston] You. - [Joey] Dude, I just sent a message. - Did you ever hear that story about the woman who went insane and beat the shit out of her man with a shovel? [Joey laughs] - [Joey] Yeah, who do you think that was? - Just saying, a woman with a shovel's dangerous. - [Joey] Shep, we're gonna take a right. [country music] - Alright, we need a shovel, guys. - [Joey] Do you know of any hardware stores that are open? - Not this late at night. - Well, one of us must know somebody who owns a shovel. Everybody owns a shovel. - Yeah, except for us. - Oh, Aunt Lulu. - [Heather] Is that your sister that's a pirate? - That's her. - [Heather] I love pirates! [adventurous music] - Who goes there? I will shot the pants off your butt with my bunderbun! - Sis, it's your bro. - Who? - It's your brother, I need a shovel. - Hey, she does look like a pirate. - Shit, Aunt Lulu's blind and deaf. - This mansion is awful private. Now why don't you come out here and I will shoot you straight. - Oh shit, he's gonna get us killed! - Come into the light! - Lulu. - Dad, stay out of the light. - It's your brother, Houston. - What's that now? - [Houston] It's your brother, Houston. - Oh, Houston, why didn't you say so? Come on in. - So what did you think you were gonna do with my old BB gun anyway? - Oh, I don't know. I thought BB King was a very good performer. [hiccuping] - Great start to my evening. We almost got shot by somebody's sister trying to find a shovel. - Her bark is much worse than her bite. She's never killed anybody in her entire life. I don't think. Shepard, direct me, which way? - Can't you stop those hiccups? [Heather hiccups] - Boo! - That's really-- - Boo! [Heather gasps] Try it. - [Shepard] Alright, 405 South. - Okay, good. What I wanna do is pull over somewhere down up there and I want you to get out, get like a nice establishing pull by, drive-by, and use like a low wide Dutch scary angle. - [Shepard] How wide do you wanna go, 16 or 18 millimeter? - 18 millimeter will have less distortion. - Good idea, let's go with the 18. - [Shepard] Okay. - This looks weird, how's this? - [Shepard] Watch out for the bogeyman. [car beeping] [guitar music] - [Houston] He's gonna like this shot. - [Shepard] What's that? [growling] Something out there. [growling] Something definitely out there. Shit! - Oh my God, it's a wolf! - [Joey] Shep, get in! [growling] - Hurry! [growling] [Heather whimpers] - I wanna go home. - She's right, we gotta abort. - It's okay, I'm okay, everyone's alright. We're gonna go home now. [Heather whimpers] Hey, dude? You wanna do something about her? - Would you stop making so much noise! Can't you see we've all had a stressful day, just not you! [Heather cries] - We're going home. - I think this is like Dark Night of the Soul. - What is she talking about? [soft rock music] - Look at this, look! Wait, Houston, turn around! - What? - Look at this! Look at this, the wolf was part of the remote viewing. You saw it, you saw the future! - I don't know. - This is so weird. This is real! We have to go back, we have to go after the treasure. This is real. This is real now. - So two close encounters with death, you wanna keep going? - But technically it was only one. And Aunty Lulu's bark is much worse than her bite. If we follow the papers in detail we can figure out what's gonna happen next. - Coffee anyone? [violin music] This place is weird. - What kind of restaurant are we at if they don't even turn up the lights? Where is our food? - You got the 405 South to what? - He's working on it, be patient. - Well, it's a long freeway. Just imagine it's a treasure map that's leading us to $100 million. - Shh, wait! Heck, what's he doing? I'm so hungry! - I'm gonna go look for him. - [Heather] I don't think we're ever gonna eat. - It's freezing in here. [knocking] - [Joey] Hello? Man, good for nothin' waiter. Dirty robes, supposed to be on vacation. I'm up here looking for this guy. Hey, I know you guys. I can see you, but you can't see me. Dude, put me on speaker. I'm in his office right now. I can see you guys on camera. Hi, yeah, okay, I see you. Okay, you can stop waving now. Oh, man. Dude, he thinks he's on Dancing With The Stars! Oh my god, I think this guy's a serial killer! Tell my Mom I love her. [match striking] [Heather laughs] [thrilling music] - Sorry, folks, it took so long. I'm really shy on help tonight. - This is a steak, I ordered a tuna fish sandwich. - I ordered pancakes. - I don't eat beef. - Sorry, folks, it took so long. We're really shy on help tonight. What about you? - A root beer float? - You didn't order burger and fries? - No. - I could take it all back, it's no problem. - That's okay. - No, don't worry about it. I wanna get back on the road, I'll eat it. - I'll just take my fries, but can you turn up the lights? - [Joey] And the heat. - The lights. [thrilling music] - [Heather] Yeah, the lights. He is so weird. Can we just get back to the drawings? - Yeah, let's go over what we got so far. Can I see those, Dad? Well, a tattooed cop. - I don't like cops! - Uh, a key, it's like an unusual key, like a skeleton key or something and it says lost key with a question mark. A bus depot. Mexican stores? - Mexico? No, you guys, the cartel's gonna chop our heads off. We can't go to Mexico. - Wait, there's a girl. She's running and somebody's chasing her. - Wait, that was the scene we just filmed. - Well, you see that's the thing, guys. Sometimes it's imagination, memory, subconscious, it's really hard to tell the difference. Maybe it's even all coincidence, I don't know. But there is a thing called confirmation bias, selective thinking. - [Shepard] What's that? - Where one tends to notice and look for what one believes and totally ignore what one does not believe. - Francis Bacon. - [Shepard] Mm, bacon. - No, Francis Bacon, he's a philosopher. He said that it's peculiar and perpetual error. Human imagination will always be more moved and excited by affirmations than by negatives, it's true. - [Houston] [laughs] Very good, Joey. Proud of you. - Thanks. - When did you start reading, Joey? - It didn't happen until like very recently. Somebody gave me a children's book called-- - Okay, you saw the treasure. You saw the wolf, you didn't just imagine those things. Let's keep going. - The dead body. - Okay, yuck! Maybe you did just imagine that part. - Guys, I think I got the location. I got the location. - Let me see. It's a pyramid in Egypt? - I thought we were going to Mexico. Is that why we're taking the 405 South? To go the airport, to go to Egypt? Are you out of your mind? Are you insane? - I have a hunch, I think it might be something else. - What? - 42.3 billion candles? That's a lotta candles to be inside a pyramid, don't you think? - What you thinkin'? - Yeah? - Guys, they're not inside the pyramid. They're on top of it. - That makes absolutely no sense. - The tip of this pyramid has the brightest beam in the entire world at 42.3 billion candle power. Do you follow? - [Joey] Not at all. - The Luxor Hotel in Vegas! - Shit, you're right. [Heather shouts] - Shep, you're a genius! We're going to Vegas baby, woo! - [Shepard] Ya-hoo! [tires screeching] - [Joey] Would be nice to have enough money to do the right thing once in a while. - So what's the scariest thing you guys have ever encountered? - The movie Jaws. When the group had retired to the boat's cabin, drinking, getting drunk and showing each other's scars. Ehen he tells his experiences as a survivor of the sinking of the SS, the Annapolis. Witnessing the entire crew murdered, being attacked by 1000 hungry sharks. 100 screaming men being eaten alive. Blood bubbling up. - Good movie. - I think it was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction of 1961. Aliens with the big eyes took them into their UFO and did sexual experiments on 'em. Also there was that mother that cut off her son's head and sewed it to her own shoulder. That was pretty intense. - Ghosts. When you're sleeping and you wake 'cause you feel a presence. And you are so scared you just wanna jump outta bed and run out of the room but you can't even move. It's like that presence is paralyzing you, you're just stuck there. - [Joey] What are you most scared of? - Complete darkness. - That's it? - Yeah. - So you couldn't be Helen Keller, that's for sure. - [Joey] Whoa. - Jeez. - We got a flat, I gotta pull over. Oh my God, look at this thing. Must weigh 500 pounds! Oh. - You guys even know how to fix it? - We're men! Let's go, Joey. - Damn, we're losing power. - [Shepard] What are you guys waiting for? The jacks all set up? - Here we go again, me and my only friend. Over in Killarney many years ago. - Oh, Shep, you actually do know how to fix this thing? - Yeah, don't you? - [Joey] Yeah. [owl hooting] - And I'd give the world to hear and then she left outside the cabin door. [ominous music] Guys? Guys? Guys? Guys? Guys? Guys? Guys, where are you? Guys? Where are you? Guys? [dramatic music] - What's up? [Heather gasps] - Holy shit! Where have you been? - We had to pee. - All of you guys at the same time? - [Shepard] I guess it's like an animal thing. - Yeah, animal thing my ass! I felt like I was going to die inside the car! I was hearing noises and stuff. - Stop giving her a hard time, she got spooked. Come on. Everything's fine, come on, let's go. - Go back into the woods by yourself, Joey, now! - Come on, guys, you wanna go for the treasure? Big rubies, diamonds, yachts, airplanes? Come on. - Hey, do you remember earlier when you asked me like what the problem with getting married was? [Shep chuckles] - [Shepard] Point taken. You think there really is a treasure, Dad? - [Houston] Yeah. - And we're gonna find it? - Yeah. - [Shepard] What are you gonna do with all that money? - Buy things, give gifts, make movies. What about you? - [Shepard] All those same things. - Reminds me of when you were a little boy, your Mom would ask you what do you wanna be when you get older, and you would say I just wanna be just like Daddy. - [Shepard] Yeah, except now I know better. - Yeah. [Shepard laughs] - [Shepard] Eh, well, it's still true. - Do you miss your Mom? Put that over there. You miss her? - If we really do get that money, I'm gonna buy her a place to live right near us. I could see her whenever I want. That's just the way things should be. - Yeah, that's my boy. I'll tell you what. Let's go find that treasure. - [Shepard] It's a plan. [rock music] You guys need toilet paper? [Houston laughs] ♪ Everyone can join the fun if you make it in time. ♪ - [Shepard] If we find that treasure chest, I'm gonna live in that house. - [Houston] Not over there. - [Shepard] Joey can live there. ♪ I wanna move ♪ I wanna move - There she is, that magnificent beacon, beckoning us to the treasure. - How far is it? - Maybe 15 to 20. - [Shepard] You think it's in there? - Oh, there's treasure in there alright, but not ours. No, that beam is just pointing us in the right direction. While you guys were sleeping, I did some more remote viewing. - How did you do it at the same time as driving? - I etched it in with my finger into the condensation at my side window here. - [Joey] There's nothing over there. - [Shepard] It must have evaporated. - Hey, Houston, pull over. I have an idea. [blowing] - Do that again? [blowing] Smart. That is smart. - It doesn't make any sense. - It looks like hieroglyphics. - It's not too far off from hieroglyphics. I think it's called a rebus. - What the hell is a rebus? - Oh, rebus is like a coded message that uses the images and letters and numbers instead of words. - Rebus, I remember that! Wait, here, look! - [Houston] What is she up to? - I can see you well, it's a rebus. - [Shepard] I can see you well. You get it, Joey? - What? I don't get it. - I remember seeing this rebus decoder online. Alright. So if this is right it reads, garage sale, buy map at Stoll and Maple? Maybe street names, maybe? - You guys are the greatest team. - That's pretty awesome. - I think you guys are geniuses. You're the best team I've ever had, come on. Back in the car. - Dude, wherever your dad is getting these. Or whoever he's getting these-- - [Shepard] His ideas from. - They really seem to enjoy playing a puzzle. [engine revving] - [Heather] I don't know about you guys, but I'm starving. - [Shepard] Me, too. - [Joey] Don't even say that, you guys. We have no money. - Nickel. - [Shepard] Where are we, Bratislava? - Heather, dear, can you do me a favor? Check my remote viewing pages. See if there's one that has a slot machine then nickel. - There's one that has a slot machine, nickel, thermometer, diner, and the name Jackson. - And there's a thermometer! - Wow, this is getting really real. - The largest thermometer in the world. And there's a diner under it. I'm sure it's got slot machines. [slot machine buzzing] [coins rattling] - Look at that, guys. - Ah, is that just a 20? - Just a 20? That's it, that's a 40,000% return off the nickel he invested! I'd like to see Wall Street compare to that. - Well, actually, that's Jackson on the front of it. So that's where the name Jackson comes in. - Hey, look guys, it's not exactly the treasure chest, but remote viewing is proving itself to be working. I mean, it led us to the thermometer. It was right about the nickel. $20 is not a lot, but it's enough to get us some food, a little energy in the stomachs, and we follow the clues! Keep going, find the treasure. - That's true, I agree. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You sure? - [Heather] Yeah. - You sure? - I am sure, Houston, let me tell you why. If you indulge me for a second, allow me to pontificate. - Yes, please. - In this life, when you have a hunch about something, a feeling, if you will, what are you gonna do but go for it? "Cause tomorrow may never come. You know, we're just here for today, possibly, and you may never have this chance again. So that's why, that's why we're doing it. - I like it. - Also I have no ride, so. [Houston laughs] - Alright, let's go eat something, come on. - Well put, Joey. - [Joey] Yup! - Come on, let's go get-- [rock music] - I'm so excited I don't think I can pee! Oh, God, I made it. - We need to get off the main drag. I want you to take a right on Summit. It's about two blocks up. - [Houston] Roger, got that! - Who's Roger? - [Houston] I don't know, but she still dancing back there?

About six times now. - [Houston] Looks like it. - [Shepard] GPS is giving me wrong directions. I don't get it. - [Joey] Figures. - Is there somebody we could ask? - [Shepard] Um, I don't see anybody. Hey look, look, a cop, Joey's favorite. Hey, Joey, you ask him. - I'll go ask him. - Officer? Officer? - [Shepard] What is he doing? - [Joey] Hey, that's not a cop! - Why is his face-- - [Joey] Shh! - [Shepard] What about his face? - [Heather] His face is blue. - [Houston] Officer, I'm kinda lost.

You are here. - What? - Stoll and Maple, you're streets are right here. - But I don't see the signs. - Are they filming me? - No, well, yeah. Guys, don't you know it's impolite to film without asking permission? - Oh, no, no, no, it's quite alright. It's quite alright. Look at this profile, hm. - [Houston] Very chiseled. - And the other side. Do you know I once won a kindergarten contest for my Aryan looks? - Very chiseled. - Oh yeah, looks great. - Um, beautiful. - [Shepard] Real nice, real nice. - Did you see? He changed the signs to Mein Kampf. - Shut up, just shut up. - They used to be Stoll and Maple. [man laughs] I fooled you, see, I fooled you. Hold. See, it fooled you, it fooled you.

I am here to protect and to serve. - We're good, we're good, right? Everything's good, guys. - [Shepard] I never had so much fun. - You are seeking the treasure, hm? Viva Las Vegas! [laughs] [laughing uncomfortably] X marks the spot! [laughs] [speaking in German] [speaking in German] [speaking in German] [Houston laughs] - Bye bye. - Thank you. - Those signs say Mein Kampf. Do you not know what that means? - Hitler's manifesto against the Jews. I thought that guy was gonna freaking kill us! - My heart's never pounded so hard. - I almost died laughing. - You gotta look on the bright side though. We did find the tattooed cop. - [Shepard] So which house is it? - [Joey] You're kidding right? - Come on, Joey. We've already come this far, right? - Did you not see that guy? - Listen, people are starting to wake up. And I feel like we're getting close again. I hear Billy Crystal and he's saying, come and get me, come and get me, come and get me, come and get me. - Alright, alright, alright. It could be hours before somebody has a garage sale around here, too, though. - Maybe, in the meantime I can catch like 40 and a half winks. Is anybody else tired? - After that Nazi cop? I feel like I'm never gonna sleep. - Seriously, how do you even think about closing your eyes right now? - Joey, he was driving all night. Dad, you must be exhausted. You should sleep and we'll just keep watch. - You sure you're gonna keep watch? - Of course, there's three of us. - [Joey] Yeah, we got it. - All right. - Right, Heather? - Yeah. - Hello? - Yeah. - Keep watch. [birds chirping] Shep? - [Shepard] Hm. - You were supposed to keep watch, what happened? - [Shepard] Joey, dude. - Ah! - [Shepard] Dude, wake up.

Nice wicker, I'll sell it to you real cheap. - I might like love in my life, that's true, but I don't think the chairs gonna do it. Thanks anyway.

Heather, give me that remote viewing my Dad did earlier of the map. [upbeat music] Thank you. Okay, alright now put the map behind it. This actually looks like it's working. - Oh my god, I'm getting goosebumps! [Heather gasps] Look!

Are we committed or what? - We're not, not committed. [Shep imitating chicken clucking] All right. - [Shepard] Get out, come on. Get outta the car. - Wait, shh, do you hear that? - [Joey] It sound like whispering. - That's why they call it Whisperer's Pass. - You're creepy. You're creepy, creepy! [thrilling music] [shoes crunching grass] [Heather gasps] [growling] [Heather moans] - It's just Halloween decorations. - [Joey] If this isn't the haunted tree then I don't know what is. This has gotta be it. - So this is it, guys. What I wanna do is set up the perimeter of the lighting. Lights up here, lights here, so we can see what we're doing and start digging. Come on. [lights clicking] - [Joey] Come on, let's start digging! [shoes crunching grass] - I'm not afraid of, I want to be brave. Is there really something buried in there?

Please don't, please. - [Joey] Hey, wait, Houston. What if he's got brain worms. Oh god. [Heather gasps] [Heather screams] [man laughs] - Houston, oh my God! The Nazi cop! How? Look! - What is it? - A green wrapper. [Heather gasps] You, you did this! You killed him when we were asleep! - It's folded the wrong way. - Shepard, take a look at this. - Guys, he's right. He always folds it lengthwise. This is along the width. It's not him. - What does that mean? - Well, if it wasn't you, then who did it? - Somebody's watching us. - [Heather] Who, where? [Houston laughs] - It's double remote viewing. Somebody's remote viewing us. - Who? - You're not the only kook who does this? Oh, well, you were right about the dead body. But there's no treasure. - Not here anyway. But I have a suspicion we find that mysterious person that's been watching us and that person's gonna have some answers for us. - So now what? - [Heather] We have to call 911. - [Shepard] I got nothing, what about you guys? - [Joey] My phone is dead. - Alright, guys, we're gonna have to take the body with us. Please. - No way. I'm not taking that dead Nazi cop with us in the car. - Alright, is everyone ready? - Let's go. [Heather screams] [animal howls] - [Houston] Give me a hand, Shep? I gotta go-- - Did you eve tie him down? - Yeah, I did. - [Shepard] With what? - That stupid duct tape that doesn't work. - [Heather] Oh my God! - Tell her not to worry, I'm just gonna-- - [Heather] Oh God. - See, that's easy, no problem. Shepard. - [Shepard] Yeah? - You think he'll be all right? - No. - Why? - [Shepard] He fell off the roof and we weren't even moving. - He'll be fine. He wasn't flat before, now he's flat. Come on, let's go. - [Shepard] It doesn't look very flat. [engine revving] - She all right? - [Heather] We have a dead body and we don't have any treasure. We have nothing. - [Joey] Yeah, we have the exact opposite of what we went looking for. - Guys, guys, listen up! Ding, ding, ding, ding! Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Our inked up Nazi friend upstairs is alias Adolf Himmler. Fuck me. FBI's most wanted for the murder of Leonard Hunter, a famous treasure hunter who uncovered a bounty of half a billion dollars. - You hear this? - Shit! - Shitting dollar signs! - That's ridiculous. Crazy. - The wealthiest part of the ship, the stern castle, was filled with a king's ransom beyond compare consisting of gold bar's two stories high and 24 tons of silver bullion. - Holy Davy Jones locker. - From The Monkees? - Part of the bounty stolen was called The Esperanza mother load, consisted of pieces of eight gold coins, Colombian emeralds, and other jewels from the wreckage called the Spanish galleon, Nuestra Esperanza. - Davy Jones locker! - So we're still on, right? - Well, it's up to you guys. - Of course, I wanna go. Are you crazy? Did you hear all that? [Heather squeals] [Heather claps] I'm gonna be rich! - [Shepard] This is the shittiest police station I've ever seen. I think they're closed. - What kinda police station closes? - The kind you find in these crazy, sicko towns. - Alright, I'll leave the body with a note. [soft rock music] That's it. I think that's the house. [owl hooting] - [Heather] That's creepy alright. - Yeah, whoever's been doing the remote viewing on us I think is in that house. - So call the cops! - That's a great idea, Joey. Why don't we just go the police station we just left, the one that closes up at night. - You know what, dude, there's already been one murder. Do you wanna be next? - You're such a pussy. - Can you guys shut up? You're not really helping anything. - I want you kiddies to make nice. I'm gonna go check it out, I'll be back. - [Shepard] Are you sure that's such a good idea, Dad? I'm having second thoughts. - It'll be okay. - [Heather] I don't think it's a good idea! [Heather gasps] [Joey squeals] - If I'm not back, call the FBI. - What's going on? Alright, you guys. Stay here, I'm gonna go follow him. [Heather hiccups] I'll be back. Dad? What the hell? How high does that go up? Jumbo rat shit hole in the ceiling. - Did you find anything? [Shepard gasps] - Shit, dude, you scared the shit outta me. Have you seen my Dad? - No, I haven't seen anything. - [Shepard] Stay close. Dad. Dad! [Joey shouts] - Dude, dude! Watch where you're going, you scared me. - You scared me. - Did you find anything yet? - [Shepard] No. Go that way. Wait, wait out here. I'm gonna check this room, don't go anywhere. Look, stairs. You go, I'll be right behind you. [Shepard gasps] - [Joey] There's nothing up here, guys. - You again. - Yeah, me again. Damn, I just hit my head on something really hard. - [Heather] You okay? - No. - [Heather] You hit the ceiling. - Witch. Ow! - Trippy. Let's go. - [Joey] Heather, Heather. Make a face. - Really, right now? Are you serious? [chuckles] - It's so weird. [dramatic music] Oh shit. - Your Dad's in here. [whispering] - Should we follow her? - [Shepard] Dad. Are you okay? - Sure, yeah. - [Shepard] I was calling you. You didn't hear me? - No. - I was yelling. - No, I didn't hear anything. - I'm sorry about that. The gentleman that lived here before I moved in was a musician. He had all the walls soundproofed and your father couldn't hear anything as a result. Can I offer any of you anything to drink? Some wine? - Oh, is that red? - It sure is. [dramatic music] [Heather laughs] - Uh, I, nevermind. - So what are you all doing here anyway in the middle of the night? Are you lost? - Well, you know, you can always find your way with remote viewing. Can't you? [woman laughs] - I guess I can't keep this masquerade up any longer, can I? Not with a master sleuth such as yourself. And you fry me with those eyes. Those magnificent eyes. - I wanna know why have you been watching us. - I have not, or at least not intentionally. You happen to get in the way of my own visions! - You murdered him, didn't you? [woman laughs] - Well, he's not so much the type to commit suicide, that's for sure. Which is too bad. But, no, I didn't murder him. - Well, let me say, we dug up a body and he's dead as a doornail. [woman laughs] - Well, yes, bravo. That I know. I left him there lying on the floor with a dagger sticking out his chest! Now. Can I offer any of you anything? Lolly pop? Ah! [chuckles] - I love lolly pops. - Here you go, my dear. - Thank you. - Those are delicious. And for you, dear, you'd adore the green one. I know. - Why are you playing with me? - Because you and I are the same. We both share a magnificent talent! Doesn't that make you happy? Don't you enjoy when you meet someone who shares a gift so rare and special? It makes me giddy. Come, come on. I have something to show you all. It's impressive, right? My pride and joy. - [Houston] Well, look at that. - So that thoughtful, kind, sweet, SS officer provided us with a video for your viewing pleasure. [woman chuckles] - Joey. - [Joey] What? What? - Take a look. - Come over here. [woman screaming] - I'll fucking kill you. [woman whimpering] [man grunting] Ah, my leg! My eye! [man groaning] Holy fuck! What did I do? - So. As you can see, I'm innocent. - [Joey] That was just like the scene we filmed. - You're telling me. - I'm ready for that drink. - [Houston] Why didn't you go to the police with this? [woman laughs] - Well, the police are hard to find here. Why have you come all the way here from LA to visit sweet, innocent me? Was it to watch home videos and clear me of murder charges, was it? - I'm just gonna have a word with my friends here for a second in private if that's okay. - Of course, sweetie. - Guys, come here. I'm thinking maybe we should take her with us. - [Joey] Are you crazy? - You think we should share the treasure with her? - Are you crazy, we don't owe here anything. - Yeah, that's only if she helped us find it. - Besides, we don't even know if she knows where it is. - Right. - Alright. Uh, Miss. - Please, call me Liliane. I believe that we've known each other for long enough that you can go on a first name basis. - Well yes, Liliane. We're on a very special, but very, very dangerous journey. We'd rather keep our reasons to ourselves. - Of course. So I'm sorry about your trauma that you've been through. - No. Please don't apologize. It has been a pleasure getting to know all of you. If you follow me, I'll show you out. - [Heather] Sure. - Please, this way. Just follow me along this way, it will be best. You know, it is I who should really be apologizing to you. - [Houston] Oh? - Yes, an eye for an eye. Just as you got in the way of my vision, unintentionally I'm sure, I blocked your vision. Every key has a lock and you know the location of the lock, but have no key. And I have a key, but don't know the location of the lock. So, you see, Houston, sweetie, I propose that we combine our images to present the clear vision of what it is that you seek! - Interesting, to say the least. - [Liliane] I told you I was intrigued. - Now, what is it you want in return? - Just your kindred company. - So you wanna come with us for a joyride? - I guess you could put it that way, yes. - I guess it's to the land of Oz. Shall we? - Let's. [upbeat music] ♪ If I don't I'll go insane - Hey, it's like a Mexican version of Cinco de Mayo! ♪ Like a madman in the rain - [Heather] Look, there's the buses you drew. - Yeah, look at that. - There was a bus depot, I couldn't see that? - Perhaps because you're a jet-setter. - [Liliane] Oh, hardly. [Latin instrumental music] [upbeat music] I guess this is what you've been looking for. - Good Jesus! - God. - Hey, Joey, man, you okay? You don't look to good. Joey, you all right? Check him out, are you okay, pal? - What if it's just filled with sand? - [Shepard] If it's just sand, why would they put a lock on it? Think about it. - How are we gonna open it? - [Shepard] I'll get a crowbar. We'll jimmy it open. - [Houston] All right. Hurry up, 'cause the girls are like really antsy for the money. - Okay, ready? - [Joey] Go for it. [wood creaking] [dramatic music] [Heather gasps] [Heather shouts] [Heather laughs] - Are you okay? - I can hear the angels singing. Do you hear them? - I can hear something singing. Cayman Islands, here I come! - Dad, you know you're the best Dad I've ever had? - I'm the only Dad you ever had. - How we going to, uh, divvy this up right here? - Well, you could take the usual route. One for you, one for you, one for you, one for you, and so on and so forth. That would be the easiest way. Well, anyway, it's getting late and I wouldn't want to turn into a pumpkin. So it has been an absolute pleasure going on this adventure with all of you and I wish you all the best, au revoir! - Is she kidding? - Liliane! - Yes, sweetie? - You're kidding, right? - About? - Leaving without taking your share of the treasure. - I told you before, it's not the material that I seek. It's the spiritual. - [Joey] She's still kidding, isn't she? - Cheers! - You can have some of mine! - [Shepard] Yeah, you can have some of his! Dad, what do you think her deal is? - I don't know, that is strange, but beautiful. - Where to next? [seagulls cawing] Excuse me. Know where I can find McGregor? - Who's asking? - We are. Is this your Ruby Pearl, here? It's lovely. We're actually a group of filmmakers from Los Angeles and we were wondering if you were going somewhere. I like your boat. Is he around here? - Hey, McGregor! Movie people! - [Houston] Ahoy! - [McGregor] Ahoy, yourself. - Hi, my name is Houston. - Yeah. - This is my son, Shepard. - Hello. - My beautiful actress here, Heather. And Joey is my filmmaker. - Well, McGregor is the name. What can I do for you, blokes? - Is this your boat? - The Ruby Pearl, oh yeah. She's all mine now, sadly, but I'll proudly accept her. Used to be called by me partner Leonard, Leonard Hunter. Ah, what a sailor he was. - Leonard Hunter? - The finest sailor to sail the Seven Seas as ever lived. That is until he met up with the old skull and crossbones. I'll tell you, took the hand of some evil jolly roger for sure. What can I do for you land lovers? - Can you tell us about the treasure? - Which one? - There's more than one? - Let me educate you, my sweet little lass. There's more gold and silver out in that ocean there then all the land your pretty little high heels can stand on. For 25 years, I've searched shipwrecks and Spanish plate fleets that have sailed from Spain back to the New World that's been lost at sea. I've snarled with more galleons protected by their skeletons than I care to remember. But all the while pulling up unimaginable amounts of bounty. - Within the Western mother load? - [McGregor] What do you know about that, boy? - You know, pieces of eight, gold doubloons, Columbian emeralds, a few diamonds the size of strawberries. - There's an old adage: red skies at night, sailors delight. - Delight. - [together] Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning. - Yeah, but it was red skies all right. But Old Leonard, yeah, Leonard stayed put. He didn't even twitch a muscle. Must have felt in his bones a storm were brewing. Now stubbornly we stayed our course. That surely being responsible for our survival. And then the morning came. Everything was quiet, hurricane passed. Old Leonard took to the warm waters below. That's when he first picked up the sun rays. Seeing something shiny. Gold bars, gold bars under the west stern, hundreds of 'em. Piled as high as buzzards on a shit wagon. Well, me, I was detoured East about 50 feet off the bow. I was by a hungry shark. And that's when I discovered something hard and dark. A treasure chest. That belonging to he Nuestra mother load. I just had to tip me hat off to that shark. If it wasn't for her, I'd have never found it. God love her. - Please go on, this is fascinating. - Oh, the next day Leonard took the treasure to our shop. Said he was meeting some wealthy museum curator from overseas. I don't know, the guy was claiming he wanted to showcase the treasure in his museums across Europe. That's when I found Leonard, dead, cold-blooded murder. Treasure chest gone, no sign of the filthy bastard that did it. - We found him. Adolf Himmler, dead as a doornail. We found him buried. - Who are you people? - Well, it's a little too hard to explain right now, but, McGregor, I think I got something here that belongs to you. - What's that? [seagulls cawing] [upbeat music] Oh. Well, stiffen me crotch, hah! I'll be a wet sponge off of the arse of a nor'wester. The mother load! [Houston laughs] Nice work, boys. Very nice. - Boy, I guess our work is done here. - McGregor, it was nice to meet you. You take care now. - Hold on, mate. Get back here. Your work may be finished, but our's just begun. Winxy. [adventurous music] - Houston, darling, I knew I could count on you. You see, darling, didn't I tell you he has the most wonderful eyes? - You would never have found the Esperanza without him. - Now be a good husband and pour some hogshead for everyone. It's over 300 years old. - Your wife? - Yes, my wife. She's a great one, at that. You know what, she finds all the treasure. But I gotta admit, I was having a tough time tracking our sweet Esperanza this time. - It's true. - And for the gorgeous ladies. For you, for you. [horn blaring] - A toast. To kindred spirits. - Kindred spirits - Now, everyone dig into the treasure! - Go on, go ahead. She wants you all to dig in and take what's rightfully yours. - You're shitting us, right? - No way. - Please, my husband and I have more than enough jewels and doubloons for ourselves. We insist, take your share! - Snookums, they're still being stubborn! [McGregor chuckles] - You scary little scallywags. Would you be wanting your treasure or would you rather be keyholed? - Yo ho ho, we'll have them walk the plank! - Aye, the better. - Yes, go on. - This? - A little bit more, you greedy cockroach. - Joey. - I don't need much, I just. - Chip? - Go ahead, dude. - Might as well. Mine's bigger than yours. - [McGregor] How about you, beautiful eyes? - Oh, not me, I'm not one to take advantage, but thanks anyway. - Shepard, would you please do me a favor and take an extra big handful for your lovely Dad? - Will you hold this? Don't judge. - Extra big. There's still so much treasure that's left. Now we just have to figure out what charity we want to donate it to. - Listen, I want you guys to stay in touch with us because kindred spirits are hard to come by. - Come here. Oh! So good to see you again. Darling. - McGregor. - Yes. - Take care of yourself, pal. - Ah, you know, matey. Listen, you come back quickly. We'll do a little swashbuckling. You come back. - Of course, of course. Hey, Houston. I'll be keeping an eye on you. - You know, I'm really gonna miss you guys. [Heather whimpers] I had a lotta fun. - Heather, what are you talking about? You know we're gonna see each other tomorrow, right? - Oh, yeah. [Heather laughs] We gotta look through all the footage and start editing. I forgot. [upbeat music] - [Joey] We'll see you tomorrow, Heather. - Alright, bye. - [Joey] Okay, bye. - [Shepard] Don't let any of your six roommates see those diamonds. - Yeah, yeah right! - [Joey] Bye. Poor girl was all emotional. - [Houston] You see that? - [Joey] Hey, Houston, you can drop me off right here. - [Houston] What? - [Joey] Anywhere, just drop me off. - [Houston] You serious? - [Joey] Yeah, this spot, pull over. - [Houston] Okay. - [Joey] Houston, are you gonna stop or not? - [Houston] We got a flat? What's wrong? - [Shepard] What are you talking about? - Where is he going? - We're stopping here. - [Houston] What's he doing? - Thanks for everything, you guys. I'll see you later, okay? - [Houston] Where are you going? - Dude, dude, what are you doing? You don't live here. - I'll make 'em an offer. - What if they don't wanna sell? - They must take diamonds. - Good luck. See you later. - See you tomorrow. - What a character. Hey, where are we going? - The weirdo widow. - Hey, we never paid the bill. [Shepard sighs] What do you think the next film's gonna be about? - Is there life after death? - Hm. What do you think? - I have no idea. - Yet.
