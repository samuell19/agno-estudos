It's just so great, huh? Lots of space out there to play with all of your new friends. All right, honey, I'm going to get some more boxes in the car and then make dinner. Are you okay? I don't feel right. Well, why don't you lie down for a little bit and take a nap. ♪ Mr. Sandman ♪ ♪ Bring me a dream ♪ ♪ Make him the cutest ♪ ♪ That I've ever seen ♪ ♪ Give him two lips ♪ ♪ Like roses in clover ♪ ♪ Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over ♪ ♪ Sandman ♪ ♪ I'm so alone ♪ ♪ Don't have nobody ♪ ♪ To call my own ♪ ♪ Please turn on your magic beam ♪ ♪ Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream ♪ ♪ Tell him that his lonesome nights are over ♪ I thought my own Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful, but this new one is the greatest ever.

No, look, look, look, look! Okay, okay. Let's see. No, no monsters out here. There was a storm out there, though. So maybe that's what scared you, huh? I know, I was having a bad dream too. Was there a monster in it? Yes, and it was very scary. But I know that you and I are completely safe, like two bugs, snug in a rug. Okay? Get some rest, babe. You got school tomorrow. I don't want to go to school. Well, you have to, Mommy says. Come on, lie down. Lay down. Get some sleep. Mom, can you leave the door open? Of course. Dr. Weaver's office. How may I help you?

Well, I had a great first day at work. The ladies, they're so nice, Kathy and, um... Susan. Well, I just got such a tickle out of all of them. Cody, eat your dinner. I'm not hungry. Well, try to eat a little. The troll was twice as big as the biggest Billy goat gruff, but the Billy goat was not afraid. He lowered his horns and ran at the troll, pushing him over the bridge. The troll screamed with fury as he fell into the water and was swept away by the current. Then, the biggest Billy goat gruff joined his family in the meadow and told them they never to worry about crossing the bridge again. The end. Read another one. Sorry. The time has come for counting sheep for little boys who need their sleep. Now lie down. You've got school tomorrow. Got to get some rest. Goodnight, sweet prince. Leave the door open, okay? Okay.

Oh, well, 8:30 would just be wonderful. Hey, I found her. Okay, I'll be there at 8:30... - Hello? - Laura? I thought my own Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful, but this new one is the greatest ever... It uses a new system of spotless cleansing, two detergent washes and a few drops of this special wetting agent squirted automatically. Hello? Laura. Mother. Mother, how could you give Scott my number? Cody. Laura, where have you been? He just called here. How could you do that? I didn't give him your number. I only gave it to a few of your friends. Why? Why would you do that? I told you not to give it to anyone. They're your friends. Did you give him my address too? Is he gonna come here? He's not going to come there, Laura. He just wants to talk to you. He feels so bad. I don't care how he feels. I don't know how you can even speak to him after what he did. You're supposed to be on our side. Grandma would be. Of course we're on your side, Laura. No you're not. Honey, why don't I come and stay with you for a while? No. No. I don't need any help. Everything's perfect. Mom! Cody. Cody, what's wrong? There was a monster in my room. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Mom, the monster from the pond was in my room! Honey, there's no monster. You're just having a bad dream. You're not listening to me. It was right here. It doesn't feel like a dream, I know, but it was, I promise. The monster was here. As I yearn to return to you, so will you yearn to return to me. When our paths do cross again, our hearts will entwined with ecstasy. Laura, I thought you were Mrs. Seton's ghost. No, Grandma. She doesn't like it in the attic. I only ever see her in the basement. Me too. Where did you find this old thing? Ugh. Is he really worth the effort? Oh, honey, don't cry. I can't even imagine how hard it is to be young these days. It was so much simpler back in my time. I wish I could take you back there with me. I wish I could too. You'd fit right in. Thanks, Grandma. This is Dr. Weaver's office. How may I help you? Hi, Francine? It's Laura Butler. Hi, Laura. We've been trying to reach you. Oh, Dr. Weaver just walked in, hold on. Laura, how are you? Hi, Doctor. I don't know. What's going on? Scott called. Are you having the dreams again? Yeah. I'm wondering if maybe I should go back on medication. You know, I prefer we didn't handle them through medication. Can you come in today? No, I'm out of town. Where are you? Laura? I'm here. Where are you? You know, I think I'm just being silly. Everything will be fine. - Thank you, Doctor. - Laura? Cody, hurry up. We're going to be late. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. What can I do for you? Well, I just wanted to let you know that the, the kitchen sink was leaking. So I turned off the water. Probably just need your new seed washer. I'll come by and take a look. Thank you. And also the television sort of popped and now it's not working. We're not responsible for the television. Well, now, Lenora, I'd go by and take a look at it. Well, but she's going to have to pay for the parts and the television was left behind. It's not part of the house. That's okay. If you wouldn't mind just taking a look. Will do. Okay. Well, have a nice day. You as well, young lady. That's how it starts. I thought my own Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful, but this new one is the greatest ever. It uses a new system of spotless cleanser, two detergent washes, plus a few drops of this special wetting agent squirted automatically in the second rinse water. And do you know what this does?

Turn to the classified pages of your phone book. That's where you will find your nearest Hotpoint dealer. Refrigerators, automatic washers and... Cody! Cody! I want to go home. Amber. Is this you? You did this? Are you sure? So I thought maybe you had come by the house for something. No, no, probably a raccoon. They climb all over the place. Bunch of pests. No, I don't think this was a raccoon. My son said that he saw something down by the pond. He's not supposed to be at the pond. I don't want him playing near there. Yes, I know. I have, uh, I've already told him to stay away from it. I can set some traps from the raccoons. Again, I really don't think it was a raccoon. So I don't think that that would be helpful. Oh, but I did manage to lock myself out of the house last night when I went to investigate and... Wait, that's impossible. The door doesn't lock on its own... Well, then I guess it was stuck. - Well you need... - Anyway. I had to break the window on the door to get in. So I'm so sorry. We already fixed the sink. We're not paying for that window. You broke it. Of course I will pay for the window. Anytime you can stop by. Don't you worry. I'll take care of it. Thank you. Hey, how was your day? You're not still mad at me, are you? Honey, I said I was sorry. How about some ice cream? Huh? Yeah. Cody, why don't you go play? This looks fun. Kickball. Why don't you go play with them? They're friends. Well, this kid's all by himself. He looks like he could use a friend. Why don't you go ask him to play? He's a dipstick. Well, maybe you could help him be a better person. Right? Go on. Go ask him to play. I'll hold your ice cream. I don't want to. Go on, ask him to play. Let's go. What happened? He didn't want to play? No, I told you, let's go. Cody, did he say something to you? No, God, forget it, okay? Cody. Cody, I know you're not happy here. We are not going back to Mesa and you know why. Because you hate Dad. No, I don't hate Dad. I hate what Dad did to us. And I'm going to make very sure that he can never hurt us again. Well, I forgive him. I'm so proud of you for that. But I'm not ready. Maybe someday. In the meantime, can we try to be happy living here? Please? What you drawing? The pretty lady. What pretty lady? From the pond. I thought you said it was a monster in the pond. I thought there was a monster in the pond, but then she came to my room and talked to me. Now I understand. Understand what? Come meet her, Mom. Come talk to her. Let's go to the pond. I don't wanna go to the pond. Well, then I guess she'll just have to come to you. You know what I would love? I would love it if you would draw me a picture of your school or, or what about a bird? And we can put your drawings up on the fridge. It'll look so nice. Did you see the pretty lady? Did she talk to you, Mom? Cody, go to sleep. I love you, Mom. Cody. Cody. I said lunch was ready. Okay. That's enough. Give it back! Cody Richard Butler. Don't you ever do that again. Cody. Why are you so angry at me? I can't tell you. Is it about your birthday? I didn't forget. My birthday? I was going to ask you what you wanted to do. Anything but that. Hey, I was thinking, how about we have a party? We can, we can have balloons and ice cream and cake and presents, and we can invite your entire class. It'll be a gas, right? Okay. Okay. I don't mind, though. Keeps him happy. I'm sure our Hotpoint refrigerator doesn't mind either... Hey, he looks just like Roy Rogers. You like Roy Rogers, right? I have a feeling it'll be with us long after Dave and Ricky are grown up and married. And I love the way our Hotpoint's designed too. It could've been... All the interior arrangements are so practical. Why don't you talk to your Hotpoint dealer today about a refrigerator like this for your family? Turn to the classified pages of your phone book. That's where you will find your nearest Hotpoint dealer. There. Now there are exactly enough invitations for every kid in your class. So I want you to make sure that everyone gets one, okay? They won't come. Of course they will. Everyone loves a party. - Can I invite the pretty lady? - Who? The pretty lady from the pond. No. No, you can't. Why not? She's my best friend. She said that she would take me home. Cody. This is your home. Okay? If you would just talk to her, Mom. Cody, that's enough. Clean up your toys.

Come on. Come on. - Mom, what are you doing? - Get in the car. - Why? - Just get in. - But, Mom... - Get in the car! - Where are we going? - Anywhere but here. But why? Because she scared you? She didn't mean to scare you, Mom. Be quiet, Cody! You need to talk to her, Mom. She would never hurt you. She wouldn't hurt anyone! Enough, Cody! Enough! I don't not know what that thing is but you are never talking to it again. Do you understand? Ever! Are you gonna take me home? No, goddammit, for the hundredth time. We're not going home. Stop talking about that. Then where are we going? What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? It's okay, Mom. She's gone. I'll tell her not to bother you anymore. Okay? You should go to bed. You're tired. I'll stay with you, okay? We'll be all right. I promise. We're gonna be all right. You ready? Now, I want you to give these out as soon as you get to school, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Put 'em right in here. Hello, operator, will you connect me with St. Mary's church please? Thank you. Saint Mary's. Sister Agnes speaking. Hi. I was wondering if there might be someone available to speak with me? I, I think... I think I have a demon or something in my house. Hello? Hello? Is Mr. Langtree available? Why, what'd you break this time? Oh. Nothing, nothing. I just, um... I don't, I don't know exactly how to say this. Well, just say it. Has anyone ever said that there's something wrong with the house? What are you up to, missy? What do you mean? Because you knew exactly what you were getting into when you moved into the house. So if you think that you can come sashaying in here in that little skirt and con us into putting a whole bunch of money into that place, my husband might be stupid enough to fall for that, but I'm not. I'm not trying to do anything. Well, I don't know what you're doing here in the first place, unless you're hiding something. I am trying to ask you... if there's a ghost in the house. A ghost! Is it drugs? No, no. I have a child. Because if I get wind that any of that crap is going on in that house, I'm going to call the police, and you can be sure of the fact they'll take your child away from you. ♪ Every day ♪ ♪ It's a gettin' closer ♪ What are we going to do with all these balloons?

Laura, I have to ask you a personal question. Have you been drinking? I know you have. I can smell it. We don't tolerate drinking on the job. That's clearly stated in your employee handbook. Yes, it is. I know because I read it. But I think that if you had my job, you'd be drinking too. You try leaving your family and your friends and everything you've ever known to move to this small town in the middle of nowhere, all by yourself, simply because no one gave you any other choice. Then talk to me about drinking on the job. Laura, look. Or maybe there's a company manual on how to get rid of a monster. And I'm not talking about my ex-husband or my entire overwhelming situation. No, I am talking about an actual monster who comes into my house in the middle of the night and tries to drag my son out and drown him in a pond out back. I know you think I'm nuts. No. I don't think that. I think you need help. I do not need help. I have everything completely under control. No, you don't. There's no reason we can't help women like you. There's a number there.

Do you know Cody Butler? Have you seen Cody Butler? No. Cody? Do you know Cody Butler? Hey, do you know Cody Butler? Cody? Hey, hey, do you know Cody Butler? No? Have you seen Cody Butler? How are you today, ma'am? Officer, I came to pick up my son and I can't find him anywhere. Okay, okay. It's all right, ma'am. What's your son's name? His name is Cody Butler. He's a second grade student. I'm afraid that my ex-husband has taken him without my knowledge. Okay, well, we're going to get - to the bottom of this, okay? - Okay. Do you, do you have any identification? For Cody? No, ma'am, your identification. Hi, Laura. I'm Barb Schiff. I'm a caseworker with the department. I'm sorry it took me so long to get here. How are you? Where is Cody? I went to school to pick him up and he was not there. No, he wasn't. Where do you think he is? Does his dad have him? No, he doesn't. How do you know? Did you call him? I didn't need to. What do you mean? Laura, would you mind if we backed up a little bit? I think I could be of more help if I understood the details of Cody's accident. I'm referring to the accident last year in Arizona. Oh. Well, that was nothing. He fell in the pool. I wasn't there. I had to go to the grocery store. His father was watching him. When I came home, Scott was on the couch, watching the game and I went into the kitchen and I had this weird feeling like something wrong. And I was standing at the sink and I was looking out the window at the pool and I thought I saw something in it. When I went out to check, I saw that it was him. And then what happened? Well, I dragged him out and I performed CPR on him until the paramedics came and then they revived him and he was completely okay. Why? Are you saying there's something wrong with him because of what happened? No, that is not what I'm saying. It's okay, Laura. You're all right. I think I need some water. Okay. You sit tight. I'll get you one. ♪ She'll be coming around the mountain ♪ Cody! ♪ She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ♪ ♪ She'll be coming around the mountain ♪ Cody! ♪ She'll be coming around the mountain ♪ ♪ She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ♪ Cody, open the door. - Cody, where are you? - I'm right here.
