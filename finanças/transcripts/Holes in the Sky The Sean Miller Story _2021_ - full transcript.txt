911, what's your emergency? We need someone here immediately. There are people, there are a lot of people trying to get into my house. Okay, how many people, ma'am? I don't know. I don't know how many people, they're just... I don't know. Yeah, are they inside the house, ma'am? No, we have people inside the house. There's about five of us. You guys, where's Sean? Where is Sean? We need someone here. Okay, ma'am, I uh... Give me your address, ma'am. We're at. Okay, ma'am. I need you to stay on the line with me. I need you to tell me what's going on. - You guys, where is Sean? I've been looking outside. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? Because we haven't seen him. We thought he might have been outside. I can't see, but- - There are people outside. Brett, have you seen anything? No, I haven't. Well, let's just get the doors locked. Ma'am, I need you to stay on the line with me. Can you tell me what's going on? It's okay. I don't know. When I look out the window, there's just lights. There's lights. It's picturesque, a cozy farmhouse nestled in the Golden Plains of America's heartland, surrounded by rich soil and the relaxing solitude of country living. It's the perfect place to escape your troubles and the trappings of a busy life. Perfect. Unless your troubles can descend on you at any time from any place. In July of 2013, Sean Miller disappeared for four days. A four day manhunt ensued that ended in a phone call from over 100 miles away and a story that would follow the couple from home to home. Seven years later, the Millers, along with documentary film crew consisting of filmmaker Ash Hamilton and his wife Chanell and cameraman Brett Pearson would revisit that fateful event, culminating in a 911 call that would baffle anyone who came near it. Hi. It's been a pleasure to meet you. Let's just get started with some basics. Why don't you give me your name, your age, occupation. My name is Ash Hamilton. I am 45 years old and I am a filmmaker. And when I'm not making films, I also teach film on the college level, film theory and film production. But I'm probably best known for my work in the horror genre, serving as a producer on films like "Camp Death III in 2D!". They've been prescribed two heaping spoonfuls of death. "Camp Death III in 2D!" A film based off of my board game property called "Slice and Dice." I'm gonna slice you to pieces. And also directing the award winning short film, "Play With Me." What? So, tell me how you became involved in this particular story. How do you know Stacy and Sean? What brought you to this? I had originally heard about the incident with Sean when it actually happened in 2013. I've always been interested in these subjects, so I was on various different news sites, different forums, and this was of particular interest when it came about because I didn't know how local it was, but I knew that it was regional. I was pretty sure that it was in the Illinois area, so I had a little more interest in it than some of the other stories. And plus, it was, I mean, in all honesty, it was it was a little more fantastic than some of the other stories. This wasn't your typical lights in the sky kind of thing. You know, this was an actual disappearance and it was something where they had local law enforcement involved. It was... I'll reiterate, it was definitely more fantastic than some of the other stories at the time that I was taking a look at. Okay. So is this the one you wanted? Yes. Okay. Do you wan't me to get a tripod or... No, I think we can just do the hand-held thing. I mean, this is really sort of for us anyway, so we don't need to be. - Can I sit down for this? - Yeah, no. You can go ahead and sit down. That's fine. You know, like any good story that has its own twists, goddammit I'm gonna go ahead and start that again. Sorry about that. So like any good story, there are twists and turns. We'll get to that in a minute. Sean Miller incident happened in 2013. Sean Miller, who was a Illinois native, which is sort of why I was drawn to the story when it originally took place in 2013, disappeared for four days, and when he came back, there were tall tales of abduction from a non-terrestrial intelligence. He was displaced. The phone call came. Similar to the Travis Walton story, miles away. In this particular instance, over 100 miles away, when he finally came back. So there were reports of phenomena happening previous to this. So I remember hearing about it in 2013. We're seeing some Associated Press articles and it got a hold of it and ran in a few different places. And, you know, we thought, man, is there a better story for a documentary, especially considering what we're into? And then we started to try to make the documentary. And lo and behold, we can't find anything on the Sean Miller story. So. It's late. It is, my god! It's 2:56 in the morning and there's a Reddit thread that I've been posting in intermittently for the last few months. But tonight it was different because someone DM'd me and they had a screens hot of one of the articles and this has been probably the biggest news on that front in a while. So I was pretty excited and I'm looking it over and it looks pretty legit and not like 5 minutes later I get another DM from the same guy and he's telling me that not only does he live like around the same town that Sean Miller currently lives in, like not the residence from seven years ago or four years ago, but we're talking right now and he follows all this up with the fact that he says that he's got his email address. Okay, so it's now been about a month since I had received what I was told was Sean Miller's email address. About 8 minutes ago I receive a notification for a return email from Sean Miller's email address. Okay. "I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I've been burned on this before, multiple times, so I'm more than a little cautious. We are finally at a point where we don't get..." I guess it's supposed to say "we're finally at a point where we don't get a lot of these emails anymore, and it's taken us years to get here. Please, you need to respect our privacy." Now. Wait. Okay. "If I give you 5 minutes and I say no. Well, then that's my final no." So. Yeah, 5 minutes. I'm usually up til midnight. Holy shit. And there's actually a phone number here. Here goes. So how are you going to feel about being away from our home for a week? Well, you know? I'll miss the cats. They won't miss me. And if it were to Disney, that would be super exciting because it's a vacation. But it's not. It's to a stranger's house. So. I'm a little bit, little bit apprehensive, but... I could get a shoulder under there. That's about it. That's about all I could get. You know I could probably get under there, but that would not be that comfortable. I'd probably get a terrible leg cramp in the hamstring. I could take a nap, but I'd wake up with my neck all screwed up and... I am positive that I could contort myself into position that one testicle would pop out and shoot across the room. Probably. That's what would happen to me. Just let me know first and I'll turn on the camera. It would be, it would be, well, it's free special effects, which I do love free, as anyone will know. Are you just aiming at me because you can see my cleavage? That's exactly what I'm doing. Actually. So if you could give me your full name, your age and what your affiliation is with the documentary and the filmmakers behind it. Okay. My name is Brett Pearson. I'm 38 years old, and my association to the filmmakers, Ash and Chanell are good friends of mine. I've known 'em for several years and we've kind of go back a long way. I've been working for them on and off, like I said, several years. This is kind of my foundation. This is where I got my feet wet with doing documentary type camera work. It's mostly what I do for them, but I've done some mic work, some audio editing, pretty much whatever I'm asked. So I got called in to do this documentary to... The Millers. Things were experienced at the residence and dropped what I was doing, which wasn't much of anything and came to help out. Take a brief tour here in the Horror Fix offices before we leave. See what our man in the field, our DP Brett is doing. Packing shit for the trip. So I got the tripods, lighting, batteries, extra batteries for when those don't wanna work. You mean, like, every fucking time? Tell me about it. Charger for batteries at the front door. We can grab that on the way out. Famous last words, man. Yeah, no doubt. What are your personal thoughts on the subject matter? Would you consider yourself a skeptic or a believer? Skeptic, 100%, man, like I got to see it with my own eyes if I'm gonna believe this. So, here I come. All right, get out of here. Hey, can I stop you for just a second? What? I know I don't pry, and I'm not trying to pry, but I'm just... You are okay with this, right? You are fine with with doing this? Doing this show, doing documentary? Yeah. Yeah. Like, I've done several of these with you, man. Why would this be any different? Because it is different, because we know some of the shit that the Millers went through. And I just want to know that you're okay and that you're going to be okay, because... And because I love you. I love having you there. But, you know, if you ever need to sit one out that it's not a big deal, man. Ash. What the fuck else would I be doing? So you're definitely thinking that we are alone in the universe. I haven't seen anything to change my mind. At the end of the night, when I go to sleep, I'm alone. When we take our last breath, you're gonna die alone. So unless I was to see something to change my mind at this point, no, I don't believe in any of this. I prefer to be on the other end of the camera. Honestly. It's just not really my thing. It's okay. I think we got what we need. Thanks. And the third time's the charm. Seriously? Like I was telling you, three in a row. Three times a day? Every day, all from Sean's phone. Seriously, pick it up. No, I'm telling you, pick it up, it is creepy as hell. Seriously. Okay. Okay. Got it. Well, do it. Seriously. Hello? Hello. What's wrong? I gotta get out of here for a minute, man. Hey, are you okay? - I just need a minute. - Brett? My name is Chanell Hamilton. I am 42. I am married to Ash Hamilton and we've been married for seven years. And currently my day job is working for the government. And what do you do with Ash, though, professionally? I do everything he asks of me, basically. I help set up tripods and the lighting and make sure that the batteries are charged and make sure we've got memory cards. This is, as you are, a documentary filmmaker. - Yeah. - You're part of the crew. Yeah, definitely a big part of the crew. He leans on me a lot for making sure that things are ready and in order. What is your go to, guilty pleasure sad song. The one where- Are we talking breakup songs or are we talking like somebody died song or... We can include breakups in there, sure, we can include breakup songs. So but this is sort of running the entire scope of, oh my God, I want to die. This song makes me want to die. I'm going to listen to it 10 times on repeat. How about... R.E.M. "Everybody Hurts". Oh. Breakup song. Oh, you're going to go for the breakup song? You know, I've had the most experience. Breakup song, there's this Peter Gabriel song, and I cannot remember the name of it. Is it "In your eyes"? - No. - Or is it "Stay"? - No. The one he did with Kate Bush. No. Or is that "Stay"? No, I don't know. But it's not that. - "Salisbury Hill"? - No. I don't think you know what song it is. I don't remember the name of the song. But you know that it's Peter Gabriel. Yeah. It's not like a weird like for some reason, like "Sledgehammer" was your breakup song? And what was your initial opinion of the Millers? You know, at first they seemed a little apprehensive. And somewhat standoffish. But the the days that we spent with them, we seemed to grow a friendship with them. Got to be it. Where are we on the GPS? Are we close? GPS shows that this should be it. So what did he say? Well, he he said a rickety old picket fence. Which that is a rickety old picket fence. I mean, it's a great fence, though, but it's like, man, you can't really say anything other than a rickety old picket fence. God damn. They are out in the middle of nowhere. Jesus. Home sweet home for the next couple of days. I'm not sure they have Internet out here, babe. Just being honest with you. I'm not really sure. I've got like one and a half bars. - Hey. - Ash? Yes. Hey, you doing? Good seeing you again. Do you mind, just give her a minute. She's not... super excited that this happening. So we need to just kind of let her cool for a second. Hi. - Chanell. Chanell. Yeah, I've heard about you from Ash. All good things. - Yeah. Yeah. - All good things. Brett. When I first started talking to Sean, even though we were hopeful that this whole project was gonna happen, Sean was extremely reserved. This was a couple that had not talked to news outlets for the better part of six years about this. I'm sorry. As far I knew everything was going to be cool. I feel bad because I don't want to put you guys in a position of, not cool, because, admittedly, that was a little strange. You could cut tension with a knife. I hope she's going to be cool because, like. I already felt like that tension. Well, it was definitely there. It was there. What I don't want is for us to get all the way out here, and come all the way back, because things weren't sewn up the way the way we thought they were gonna be. But... - I mean, we're here. - Yeah. No, you're right. So let's, for the time being. You know. All right. You've had some experiences that wouldn't be your typical shoot, right? And I know this is... There were incidences, there were things that happened on phone calls with Sean, on Zoom meetings with Sean, that we could not explain. So you're saying that you were starting to experience a co-experience as you were interacting with Sean? It was, not only very strange, but it was very unexpected. Some of the ones that we do, a lot of the the stuff that I do is I try to help organize the foremen on the job and try to help them get stuff done. - Sean, real quick. - Yeah. Is that what you were talking about on Zoom as far as the lights? Because I noticed that that light turned off. - Yeah. - There it went again, but yet we've got the lights on in the kitchen. Yeah. Yeah. No that's definitely something and I've checked the wiring in the house and I've had and you know, at Stacey's, urgency, I've had other people come in and check it and it's... Everything checked out okay. If you don't mind me asking. And again, I know that this is going to seem interruptive because when I think of questions, I'll ask them. Does that happen so often that we're going to have problems with our lights, or will it stay on for a while and then just do that periodically? I wish I could tell you. The incident in 2013 and this was happening in the house previous to the incident in 2013. Yeah. Yeah, it was. Okay. Now, that happened literally off camera. Yeah. But we're going to catch the audio on that. As we were talking about the phenomena with the lights, Literally one of the pots from the kitchen and I'm not exaggerating, sprang off the wall. And it did it with such force. Yeah. It busted the handle, right off. That it actually busted the handle. Yeah, 'cause it's only been used a handful of times. It's fairly new. And this is common. This is another common thing. It's something. Yeah. I don't want to say it's normal. 'Cause I mean, this isn't normal, right? It is for me. We've heard reports of cryptids and poltergeist activity associated with the Sean Miller case. Is this atypical of UFO abduction encounters? Yes. Many people don't realize when there are cases of anything that can be labeled paranormal or supernatural. There are areas where there are a lot of different things going on. And what I mean by that is you'll find even geographical areas of the world where you will have reports of UFO sightings, of Bigfoot sightings, of ghost encounters all in the same place. You know, we in the field are still investigating that. We keep our mind open. We're looking to see if there's a relationship and all of that that happens. But it is not out of the realm of possibility that there are different paranormal occurrences happening in one particular incident. Okay. So we are going to try this again. We keep having battery issues with the audio unit batteries draining as well as the camera itself. New batteries of both units that we have had to replace within about three minutes of shooting. So we're going to try to do it this time and see what happens. Luckily, we got plenty of batteries, so I think we can keep switching out if we need to. So I know that this was part of the test footage we ran through earlier, I know that we had some lighting issues. This is all stuff that we talked about on Zoom that we were prepared for. It is just happening a little more rapidly than we had expected. So we should still be good, though. So if you could please give me your name, your age. Just give us your name, your age, and your occupation. Sean Miller. I'm 43 years old. I am a Project Inspector for a local construction company. If you could Sean, Could you tell us how long you've lived in the Midwest, have you always lived in the Midwest? Yeah. Since I was little. Probably about eight or nine. For the most part, I lived in the Midwest area. When I was young, my dad did a lot of... traveling with his company and before he left we settled here with my mom, myself and him. And then we pretty much stayed, my mom and I. Apologies, but are your parents currently alive or deceased? My mother's alive. My father... Sorry. We talked about this happening. So we've seen moments that looks like it has affected every single aspect off Sean's life. There were moments where, now mind you we went into this with the idea of entertainment value, and that was what we were trying to sort of capture from the start. However, I think when you do see just how affected someone is, it does sort of center things and ground it a little bit. And I think you can tell, especially some points where he's trying so hard to be normal, and I guess he's trying so hard to just live his life and it's almost like he almost gets there. And then there's just so much baggage that it just draws him back. And I think we saw that a lot while we were there. I think the biggest thing is that I just, I like how neatly they wrap up a mystery in that 20, 15 to 20 minutes. You know, it was kind of like put a neat bow on it. But as a kid, you just, you almost kind of knew it was coming. Like he knew exactly who the bad guy was. But you still, there's a little part of you that thought they might throw a curve ball. It was whoever owned property, right? Yeah. It was like, just look at the property owner in "Scooby Doo". If you're a property owner, you're a villain. That's all there is to it. I think this was one of the first full frontal assaults on out of control capitalism in American cartoons. Big fan of the Snorks. You mean underwater Smurfs? Fuck, yeah. Second, but equal to the Snorks is Smurfs. Obviously. But, you know, when I was probably somewhere second, third, fourth grade, when I would get home from school, the exact time I got home from school, I could not get off the bus fast enough and get inside. Oddly, it was the animated "Dennis the Menace". It was weird, that I had to watch those 25 minutes of "Dennis the Menace". Running from the bus missed the first 5 minutes, but still, had to be there. So, you were always running low 5 minutes of Menace. There was an episode. I love old school "Star Wars" and droids was, like it. Was was it Ewoks and Droids? - Ewoks and Droids. - Yes. And there is this episode and it was I want to say, it's one of the ones that was I mean, a lot of them did crossovers with End or, it was one of the ones where I think they they all went to End or. And I never got to see it again. It only aired. I missed that episode. You talk about missing episodes. I missed that episode. And it was, I happened to miss it because that week... that week and that weekend, I was out camping with family. We were out at a lake and a cabin we had and we were out there camping. It was a great week, it was a lot of fun. But the reason that I remember that is because not only did I miss that episode that never aired again, that was super pissed, because I didn't get to see it until recently when you can find everything on the internet. But one of my friends I got back told me that, my friend Shane, he told me that all the kids on the block, were sitting there in front of my house watching these lights go by. And I was like, "What are you talking about lights?" Like, Are you talking about, like, you know, people running around with flashlights playing night tag? Like we used to sit around, like, you know, give- - Flashlight tag. - Yeah, flashlight tag. Yeah, yeah, that's it. But he's like, "No, no", he's like, "We were all camped out kind of on the street." We lived a little outside of town, but not too far, kind of in a little kind of rural suburb. And on my street, all the kids are gathered, I guess there's these like spheres of light that just kind of went up and down the street and they thought, at first, "Are you talking about firefly's or something?" "No, no, like actual balls, like about the size, some of them the size of a golf ball, something a little bigger, like a softball." And they were they were looking for me, he said. But I don't know. I don't know. But they stopped when I got back. They stopped. I know that you've all had some lighthearted moments. Did you ever think that you could turn your cameras off? It was like it was a struggle to put the camera down because I think each of us felt the moment we were going to put one of those cameras down, something was going to happen that could not be duplicated. Something new, something even more intense. Literally like 65 floors up, 65 floors up. So this guy is hanging over the railing. This is wrought iron. There's absolutely nothing keeping him from literally falling off the... Yeah. Lemme go check. Sorry, guys. Hold on a second. Girl scouts. Want some cookies? Babe, babe I think. I think they're around back. Okay. Yeah, they might go around. But probably some fucking kids. Oh, fuck in with us. Okay, you know what? You guys go that way, and we're gonna go around this way, and we'll try to see if we can cut 'em off around the corner, okay? - Okay. - All right. - Come on. Assholes. - Do you have a flashlight? - Yeah, I got one. Hey, who's out there? You guys seriously just knock? - No, No. - No we didn't. I saw the fucking door. Something was knocking on the door. You just walked up, and the door was almost. From the outside? Something was there, knocking. 100% Ash. Totally seen that. It's on camera. Hey. Hey, baby. Ash! Babe! You got to get up. You got to. You got to see what Brett's doing. You got to see what you he's doing. He's out here. He's out here. Okay. Should I grab my phone? God Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. C'mon hurry up. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Goddammit, I gotta find. I gotta turn the fucking light on. You know how to use this thing? He's not there. He's on the stairs. - He's on the fucking stairs? - He's on the stairs. He's on the stairs. So, I don't know. What the fuck is he doing on the stairs? I have no clue. He's freaking me out. Look at this! He's right over here. We can't see him, at least let me get the flashlight. What in the fucking world? What the fuck is going on? - What is he doing? Is he fucking talking? Yeah. Looks like it. I gotta fucking wake him up. I don't think that's a good idea. I gotta fucking wake him up. You know what's gonna fuckin' happen? He's gonna wake Sean and Stacey, which we can't fucking have. And second of all, he's half fucking asleep on the stairs. Don't make him fall down the stairs. He's not gonna fucking fall down the stairs. I don't think is a good idea. Brett. Brett. Brett. Dude. Whoa, whoa. Fuck. We know that Brett, who just went through a divorce, recently lost their son. Was this the best place for him? I didn't think that this was the best one for him in the beginning. And we talked about it. And then by the time we were as thick in the situation as we were, he definitely shouldn't have been there. Stacy, it's really nice to meet you today. Can you tell me, though, your name and your occupation and how did you know Sean? I'm Stacey Miller. I am the wife of Sean Miller. I'm 36 years old and I'm a bank teller at a local bank. I see. Have you talked about this with many of your neighbors or friends, or how widely known is this situation? No, I don't talk to much people. I mean, I have my sister. She's my backbone. Other than that, I keep to myself. It's just gotten to that point. You'll have to forgive me here, but I'm still unsure as to why you decided to stay in the house that you're in now when you've left some of the others so quickly. Well. Tell them why you made us stay. Maybe. Why don't we? Can we circle back to that one can we, we will circle back. Yeah. We will circle back. I gotta be quick because I got the interview today later on. Cross your fingers it all works out. Okay. Oh hey. Since I know you don't have a lot of time. I know we had talked about, we needed to get the video footage that you have on your phone onto our SDS so that we can take them back. So if you could, just give us your pass code and we'll go ahead and do it all. You don't have to worry about it. If you're gonna be getting ready, we can do it while you're getting ready. I looked over it man and there isn't a whole lot on there, dude. I don't know if I just didn't do it right or whatever. But there's just, I guess I must not have pressed a button or something or other just didn't seem like it turned out okay. Honestly, we can use anything for b-roll. So even if it's stuff just around the house. I mean, even if it's stuff that you think is not good. I don't think really it picked up anything. I don't think there's anything on there that'll work for you. So listen, babe. This is all great. Thank you so much. But I've got to get ready, so I'm gonna go change real quick, okay? Okay. Here. One nine, seven, eight. You can get into it. It's Sean. It's a little after two. I've been hearing this noise nonstop all night. Think there's something outside the window? It sounds like something's trying to get my attention. So I'm gonna, I'm going to go check it out and see what it is. I can hear it our there now, hopefully I can catch it. That's imposssible. It's really him. God. He's here. - Thank you. - Yeah. Excuse me. We did not take your phone, by the way. I want you to know that. But, we do need to make sure that everything that you have, we also have. It's very important. It is the reason why we are, let's face it, we're paying for the documentary. Well, all right. I understand. I don't mean to keep anything from you. So I think that there's something that you guys should see. I'll be right back. What do you think he has? Did he tell you about anything? That was super awkward. This is the stuff that we need. We've got to have it. This is my me and my dad. I was eight years old. It was our last trip. And the last time I really saw him. The other night. This is... I took a picture of this. And you can see if you look, you can see that's the same shirt. You can see that pattern. Right there. I don't know if I can really see anything. Sean, I'm sorry. - Look. Look on this. I mean, I'm not lying. Look, I mean, it's right there. That's the same. I mean, maybe Chanell, can you see? I mean, right there. Do you see it? I see something. I just don't. He's been. It's him. After we found that footage and after we sort of confronted him about it, he was, hellbent to try to persuade us that that was his father in those photos. It was something. But again, that was the nature of being there. You got certain stuff that was just unbelievable. You couldn't believe you got it. And then you were two layers removed because, and we discussed this, the DSLRs wouldn't work all of a sudden, hand held devices, phones wouldn't work all of a sudden, and then you're forced to take Polaroids. And, you know, that's the nature of the beast when it comes to stuff like that. It's technology that it's very difficult to use as far as proof. He believed it. You know, in looking at the Sean Miller case, we have to be very, very careful when we check the evidence. We are in a day and age where it's very easy to manipulate your evidence. So analyzing becomes very important. This has happened more than once, not once, but twice, Sean, withholding footage from you and now Brett, he's withholding footage from you. I think after we saw the footage that Sean had withheld from us. I think Brett's perspective on why we were there and why he was there, changed greatly. It's 2:32 a.m. I just fucking got woke up by this loud ass sound coming outside. I don't know what it is. It's bizarre. But it just keeps getting fuckin' louder and louder. And I've been up for about five minutes. Everyone's asleep in the house. Holy shit. That's the sound I'm talking about. You fucking hear that? What the fuck was that? I got up, I grabbed my phone because I don't want to miss any footage. I'm going to try to get a peek out the window and see if I can figure out what is making this sound. Oh, fuck. Dude, there's someone outside, just fucking standing there. I don't want to fucking be here right now. There should be no one here. What the fuck is going on? Holy shit! Someone just fucking came running at the door and fucking jumped on the roof. And it fuckin' looked like me. What the fuck is going on right now? Holy shit. My name is James Chandler, and I'm 54 years old and I'm an audio visual specialist. I've been hired to look into things where video has been edited or to see if someone has faked something. I was not expecting what I saw. I don't think if it was faked that my emotional response, I mean, I've seen a lot of video. I've seen really horrible things on video. That is something that just got a hold of something in me, and I can't explain it. Thank you. I appreciate it. - Hey. - Hey, baby. Hey, you. What do you have on you? What is this? Oh, no. - Sean. - What? It's nothing. What do you mean? What did he have on him? Something black. Something really dark out of his ear. As I'm driving, I've got the window down. Like I said, it was extreme. Like I told you before, it was extremely hot that summer, you know. But instead of kicking the AC on, I felt like maybe just getting that nice like wind, the smell of the grass, the smell of the farm soil. I thought that might help kind of clear my head. And so, you know, I'm driving down the country roads. I feel like I'm on the right way. I've got my hand on the steering wheel and I'm just kind of get my head out and I'm just feeling it blow and I'm looking out and I see, you know, on the field I could see fireflies, you know, which is common at that time of year. You could see them move around. And then I realized that they're not, like I realize that some of these are pacing the car. And at first I'm like, oh drunk brain, you know, just perception being off. It's dark. I'm tired. I'm upset. There was less lights at first. Just certain ones chasing me. And then I felt like I wasn't alone. It felt like something was almost whispering to me like that. So the pressure that, like. Like that sound was, like, pulling me... Like somebody was controlling my body to pull me in a different direction. I realized very quickly that every time I wanted to go back home, to go back to my wife, to go back to bed and wake up the next morning and just hope this day goes away and I can start over fresh. The more I kept being pulled somewhere else, and the more I fought against it, the stronger like the brighter the lights or the brighter the fireflies were. And I realized they weren't fireflies, they were these motes, these lights everywhere. And it was almost like, you know, I had the car radio started getting loud almost to the point where it's like high pitched and I shut it off. I couldn't deal with, it was sensory overload. And I'm just driving through the dark, but it's not dark anymore. It's so bright. It's brighter than any daylight I've ever seen. And I feel like as I'm zipping down these roads, I'm going so fast, I don't even know if I'm even on the road anymore. I can't tell what's up or down anymore. I'm just going. Were you ever afraid for your own personal safety. Yes. Yes. - Yours and the crew? - Everyone's. Everyone's. We were afraid for my safety. Especially Ash's safety. Sean, Stacey, Brett. Everyone. I can go talk to her if you want. You like the burger, man? Well, I will say, you made sure it was dead. Drew, could you stop? - Well, I mean- - Everything's fine. I mean, did you at least call Dave today? - No. - Here we go. I didn't call Dave. How many of these do I have to set up? I'm trying real fucking hard to get you going to set you up. No, man, really. I want to be able to just have you guys over and have a good time. Yeah. I can't fucking do this anymore. Drew sit down! - No. - Come on. Nice. Can't I even go to the bathroom? My God. We have a bathroom right in there, man. Oh, my God. 10 feet away. Just stop. Should I turn the camera away from the peeing guy? He's been a mess for a week now. I don't know what's wrong I'm sorry. I did try calling him. It just didn't work out. We just need to change the subject. No more talk about it. Drew, what are you doing? What's going on? You guys see that fucking guy out there? Who? Could you stop, there's nothing out there. No, I was just taking a fucking piss, and I see this guy out there, he's like, fucking staring at us. - There's nothing out there. - He's probably just a farmer. This is farmland. And it's probably just a farmer- You've had a lot to drink. Yeah, I always have a fucking lot to drink. This guy's staring at you. He's staring at you, he's staring at you. Drew, dude, honestly, he's not going to bother us. Just come and sit down, we'll have a drink together. Just eat some more burgers. Man, we're gonna fill up, it's gonna be nice. Don't worry about that guy. It's okay. - It's no big deal. - Stop, honey. There's no big deal. No, fuck dude. I'm going over there. Drew, don't. I'm going out there. He's not hurting anything if there is someone. We should probably follow him over there. Stop, Drew. Come on. - No! - Drew. - Let him go. - I'm going. I'm going. - Go around the barn. If you're gonna go over there and get yourself fucking arrested, asshole. Okay. Somebody does need to get cameras on. There is somebody out there. There is somebody out there. Hey man, what's up? What's up dude. Did you see that? Did you see that? The fuck. You guys, by the way, nobody go out there, okay? When also Sean and Stacey told us that this is also not their land. What the fuck is that? Is he coming back? Where the fuck's the other guy at? Is anybody catching the other fucking person on their camera? Could someone please fucking answer me? I don't see the other guy. I'm not seeing a goddamn thing out there. Where the fuck did the other guy go? Did he fucking punch him? Is he laying down there? Drew, where's the other guy? You okay? I don't know what's going on. Okay. Something's not right. Drew? You know where you're at? You know what? You need to go get Tasha now. Now. Tasha! You know, it's weird because you have some of these things on video. We have some of these things that we recorded. And in my mind's eye, my mind's eye, it's so sort of hazy that... you almost have to try to remember the footage more so than your memory, which is strange, and I think it's because it's just so bizarre. Yeah, there was very clearly there was a figure there. And then there wasn't and we all three saw it. We all three were experiencing the same thing. I can't explain it. Drew. We need to know if you're okay. Hey Drew. Drew. Can we talk about what happened up there? Because I'm not seeing the other guy out there at all. And I'm afraid that you did something. We need to know because we've got this all on camera. No, no, no, no, no, no. You need to calm down. You need to calm down and tell us what happened out there. Please calm down and tell us what happened. Drew! He's scaring me. Drew, you're scaring me. Can we at least just get him up over here. Okay. Stop it. Just relax. - What the fuck is going on? - Please stop. Steady your breathing. Drew you're fucking scaring me. Tasha, I'm calling the cops. You know he has a warrant! He needs help. We can't call the cops. You can't do that. Stop, Drew. - Okay, okay, okay. - Help him! - Okay, okay. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh. Oh, my God. What? What the fuck? All right. Why is it? What's up with the color? - Are you okay? - Oh, my God. I don't know how to explain... how I know it's real. So, there's no doubt in your mind right now. There's no doubt. No doubt at all. What's up man, I didn't even see you come out. Ash? Ash? Ash? Why do you think that Brett didn't show you these videos? I think Brett's experience was very different from my experience and from Chanell's experience. And, I think Brett was going through something very personal. Something very specific and singular. No. No. These things? Well, let me make something abundantly clear. These things were not human. They were not of this Earth, of this planet. What they wanted me to see. It's like an actor, when you're watching a show, you see an actor break character, whether it's like a skit comedy or just behind the scenes on like a movie. And you see them break character for a second, you're pull away, you're pulled out of the moment that they're trying to bring to you, whether it's comedy or drama or whatever. You're pulled out of that moment. You realize that it's fake. It's a facade. That facade, these faces of these people that I'm seeing. They were real people for me at first. It was something for me to hold on to as an anchor. And it was a way for me to feel safe. And then for a brief moment, that facade dropped. And I was completely... my mind can't even comprehend the horror that you would see, the ability for life around me to be distorted, my safety to crumble around me. And what I saw. The more I hold on to that and the more they realize that I was holding on to that, the more they ripped that away, and the less I can even remember now. I feel insane thinking that these things were anything but just a bad memory. It's like, losing pieces of myself. Okay. Now, this is looking pretty good. So if you could please give us your name, your age, and your occupation, please. My name is Brenda Floyd. I'm 53 years old and I am a regression therapist. In addition to being a shamanic minister, a Reiki practitioner and a breath work facilitator. You work with people who are trying to remember things that obviously are very painful for them. Can you speak a little bit about your experiences there? Well, in my experience, when people have blocks like that, it is due to some sort of trauma in their life. It can be from childhood. It can be from a past life. It can be from current situations. But it is usually some form of PTSD. Want you to take a nice deep breath. Just listen to my voice. Wherever we go on this journey, you will be safe if you just listen to my voice. Sean, I want you to think about a time or remember a time in July of 2013. I don't want to. Why not? It hurts. Can you see anything, Sean? Colors? Structures? It's hot. Humid inside. Are you alone? Are you with other people? Just keep going. There's others. Stacey. Mostly myself. I'm almost done. Seriously, it's almost done... In mid-July. 2013, do remember where you were? I got nothing. Dude, I'm out. I'm out too. We're fighting. Arguing. Do you remember what you were arguing about, Sean? Our time together. She's mad. We're not connecting. Not like we were. Is there a reason for that Sean? They're the reason. I blame myself. Chanell, I'm getting a strong breeze, coming through here, you need to watch those candles. We fight. I leave.. Sean, can you tell me where you went? I, I left. I don't know where I went. Can you look around and see where you are? There's lights. There's... They're following me in the car. You're in your car driving. I think. I can't tell. I can't feel the wheel. The lights are getting so bright. Can you look through the light? - No. - See past the light. They don't want me to. - Who's "they"? - I'm trying to. Who's "they" Sean? They don't want me to know. Can you look at their faces, Sean. No, they don't. Can you tell me what they look like Sean? I'll try to see, but. Show me their faces. They won't let me. Ah! Try to relax Sean. Try to relax. Take a deep breath. You're okay. - There. They're here. What's wrong with him? Keep going. Keep going, dude. Brenda. Brenda, seriously. Hey, hey, hey. I just need you. Just come inside. Just sign a couple of consent forms. I don't know what the fuck that was, but I'm fucking out of here. Ahhh, fuck me. So looking back, Chanell, if you could have done anything differently, what would you have changed? We would have left. We would have left earlier or left before the shit hit the fan, before, all of that happened, we would have left. We would have talked Ash into leaving and not staying to get the best footage. We would have left. We would have all gotten to leave. But then you wouldn't have had what you have. And maybe we wouldn't have lost what we lost too. So that fifth day, we were just, it was a workhorse day. I mean, it was all about like, we need to get all the shots we didn't get. We need to get any interview questions we didn't get. So it was all about pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, all day long. And I think we didn't even realize how late we were there. And so we started to sort of break down. And at that point, I think we also sort of realized that we were there too late. And I mean, we were all struck with that feeling. It wasn't just that we were there late and we were ready to take off. We were there too late. There's nothing that we don't know about, nothing that we can't see. I need the lights and I need the keys to the van. Okay. Do you want to go ahead and take that last bag out? Put the lights and the rest of the lenses away. All right. I'll be back to get the rest of the shit. Goddamn. What the fuck is that? Hey, hey, hey. Shut the lights off. Is that on? Is that on? C'mere. Come here. - What's up? Can I at least turn my camera on? What the fuck is out there? You see that? - The lights on the horizon. Okay, I have no fucking idea what that is. I'm going to actually find the flashlight. Do we know where the flashlight is? We were going to find it earlier. Course I'm going out there. I've got a camera and I've got a flashlight. So that's what I'm doing. Can you just give me a minute? I'm going out. - No. Don't go out there. - Ash! Ash! I'm going out. I don't understand why he's gotta dive right into these things. What the fuck do you think that is? Look at it! See it? Holy fucking shit. Shit! Oh, my God. You gotta tell Stacey. She's gotta call, she's got to call the fucking cops. She's gotta to call 911. She's got to do it now. - What is it? She's got to do it now. So tell me, Eric, this has been dubbed or coined the alliteration of the Miller monster. Do you know how? Who started that? Do you know? I'm not sure where that came from. Once the snippet came out and the face came out, people started dubbing it the Miller Monster. I'm not sure who exactly coined that phrase, but it's it's been around for a little while now. 911. What's your emergency? We need someone here immediately. There are people there. There's a lot of people trying to get into my house. Okay. How many people, ma'am? I don't know. I don't know how many people there's just... I don't know. Are they inside the house, ma'am. No. We have people inside the house, there's about five of us. You guys, where's Sean? Where is Sean? We need someone here. Okay, ma'am, can you give me your address, ma'am? We're at. Okay, Ma'am. I need you to stay on the line with me. I need you to tell me what's going on. You guys, where is Sean? I've been looking outside, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? Because we haven't seen him. We thought he might have been outside. I can't see- - There are people outside! Brett, can you see anything? No, I haven't. So let's just get the doors locked. Ma'am, can you stay... I need you to stay on the line with me. Tell me what's going on. - It's okay. I don't know. When I look out the window, there's just lights. There's lights. What kind of lights are there? They're bright. - Okay. - But what is that noise? There's people on my roof. They're trying to get it in. Alright, ma'am, just stay calm. I need you to stay calm, ma'am, alright? So, they're not going outside. Then, I'm going outside. You can't go outside. You have to let me go outside. We have to get Sean! I need you to calm down ma'am. I need you to stay on the phone with me, ma'am. We need help. I'm Paul Stenson, I'm 55. I'm a retired sheriff's deputy with sheriff's department. I was there for 22 years. And now I'm a man of leisure. So you were called in that night of the 911 call, here to the Miller residence, correct? That is correct. That was a fucking window. That was a window that just broke. Then I'm getting Sean. I'm going outside. No, you cant do it. No, no, you can't. You need to stay inside. We have to get Sean. You need to calm down. No, there is no calming down. What don't you understand? You guys need to get here. No, I can't stay calm. I'm trying to help you ma'am. You guys, that was Sean. - I need you to stay calm. - Do you hear him? No, I'm going to go get him. He's outside. No I'm done. I'm done. I'm going. No! No! Stacey! No, no Stacey, you can't go! Stacey! You can't go outside. Is someone there? Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. She's on the ground. She's unconscious. She touched the door- - Ambulance on the way. She touched the door and then she flew across the room, and she's on the floor. I'll have ambulances. I'll have an ambulance dispatched... medical personnel are on the way. We have several units in route. How long? Five minutes. Five minutes? He said they'll come in 5 minutes. - We don't have 5 minutes. - We don't have a choice! Can you tell them to go faster? I cannot rush personnel. They're going as fast as they're going, ma'am. I don't know what's going on. They're outside and they've surrounded the house. And there's electric shocks coming out. I think I almost lost you ma'am. We need you here. You need to be here. No, and now he's going to go outside. No, you can't go outside! No, don't go outside. Don't let anybody go out there. Don't go outside. They said don't go outside. You can't go outside. No, no. Then we'll go both go. No, neither of you will go. You can't go outside. They need to stay in the house. They said you need to stay in the house. We need to be able to identify who is a threat and who is not. - You have to stay in because- - Ma'am, who are you? I'm Chanell, Chanell Hamilton. Okay, and how are you related to the caller? We're with the film crew. We're filming a documentary about Stacey and Sean. Okay, and where did the caller go, ma'am? She tried to go outside to find Sean. And then she touched the door and she flew across the room She got pushed. She, almost like there was electricity in the door handle. She needs medical attention as well. Chanell, get down! - What else is going on- - They're on the fucking roof! Dammit, Brett. I'm fucking sorry, man. Dude, don't be sorry. I choose to fucking be here. We're all here because we wanted to be. No, I'm fucking sorry. This is a shit time to say it, but I don't know when I'm gonna get a chance. But I'm fucking sorry. I am sorry that I didn't tell you we fucking missed you, we missed you and Angie, and we fucking miss David, too. And I didn't say anything 'cause you were so goddamned hurt and I should have because you needed to know how much everybody loved them, because you loved him so goddamned much. But everybody loved him and Chanell and I loved him. And goddamn it, I'm just fucking sorry I didn't say anything earlier. Brett just fucking left. Brett, goddamn it! Please don't go outside with him. I gotta go. He may need help. - Please don't go. - I gotta go. Ma'am, can you please keep all the personnel in the house, please. Brett! Oh God. Oh Jesus, Brett! Brett! Brett! Grab my hand! Grab my. I've got you. Don't let go. Don't let go! Brett, you're slipping! You're slipping! It's okay! It's okay. Okay, ma'am you need to get them back inside. Units should be there in the next minute, ma'am. Status of units? Where are the units in progress? Ma'am? ma'am are you still there? Ma'am are you still there? I think I lost the call. What are the status of units? We need to send more back up. No one is answering right now, I'm going to try to call back. I'm not getting anything. It's just ringing. I'm not getting anything. No one's picking up. You've been reported as saying that there's never going to be a resolution to this case. Is that still your position? I couldn't find anything and I was the first one on the scene. It defies rational explanation. I can't even begin to comment on that. Ash, I think it's important for us to understand, what would you say to Brett's family? I talk, I try to talk to Brett's family. I have tried numerous times to talk to Brett's family. I have tried writing checks to Brett's family. I would say the same thing that I would say to anybody else. Brett was my best friend. He's still my best friend. He's always gonna be my best friend. You seem emotional. I fucking want him back. I want him back. Why wouldn't I want him back? Why wouldn't I want my best friend back? I'm gonna get emotional. I get emotional every time I think about Brett. We had a conversation before we even went into this documentary where I asked him if he wanted to sit this out and I should have made him do it, because I didn't think he was up for it then and I should have asked him to sit it out and I didn't do it. And that's on me and that's gonna be on me every single time I talk about it. Every time I'm asked that question, it's gonna be on me. It's gonna be on me to think about the people, not just beside me, that's missing him. And that's what I got to do. That's what I do every time people ask me if I'm being honest is I've got to look at the people who aren't around to defend themselves. Brett's not around to defend himself. All I can do. All I can do is call people and try to write checks. Ineffective, because I can't tell them what really happened and have them believe it. So are they taking your call at all? No, nobody's taking my calls. You know who's taking my calls? People who want my documentary that I can't even give them. That's who's taking my calls. That's who's taking my calls.
