Based on the autobiographical romantic, "Fucking Berlin" by Sonia Rossi. Published by Ullsetein Ver Ag. For me, Berlin is not a city, but a rhythm. This rhythm is so strong that you can easily lose yourself. That's me. Sonia. Math student. Really. Every person you meet can change your beat. We then become a new song. Or we get out of tune. Hello, Milan, it's us. Are you there? If it wasn't for the traffic, we would have been here sooner. Go find Dad. Green changed to gold color. Milan? Nice to meet you, Richard. In Berlin, you can be anything you want. But most have long forgotten what they wanted here. I wanted my degree. And a friend. And far from my parents. I worked as a waitress, hardly earned enough. But, there was no-one to tell me what to do. I had so much freedom like never before in my life. And no idea what to do with it. Hey. Hey. Uh, can I get my toothbrush back? Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about. How about, we exchange? Uh, my wallet. It's pretty too, huh? Thank you. I don't plan to see that married bartender again. No matter. FREE UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN One third... One, one quarter... And so on... If this sequence also converges to zero and... Good Morning. Hello. Do you want to find a place to sit down or stand here? Just so I know. Sorry. I, I go sit down. In order to answer this question precisely, we need an accurate description of the convergence. A mathematical definition. Convergence. Just as the concept of mathematical convergence is defined at this time, the answer is: No! Is my school bag. Don't you want to take note? It's just a preamble. They also send us everything by mail. - Really? - Yes. Hey, math with Dr. Brenner. For a good note, I would also... Oh, God! Oh, God! You will get used to it. Smoking weed is like sex, it just keeps getting better. This is Berlin, man! The hottest, dirtiest city in the world. By the way, I'm Jule. Sonia. You've not been here long, right? Mm-mm. You just have to... close your eyes... spread the arms... and glide. It was September 11th. I was 5 years old when the two planes flew into the World Trade Center in New York. For the news, that was always a big day. For me, just like everyone else... I grew up with an empty thought. I leaned back and just let myself drift. Just like that September 11th changed the whole world, this September 11th changed my world. Have you ever stopped the time? What? If this plane were to fly into a skyscraper now... and we were lying here in this meadow, do you think we could stop it? No. Look at me. Now, keep looking into my eyes until you think the reflection of the airplane has disappeared. Okay. This guy had a beat that immediately blew me away. Do you see? We have stopped the time. I took Ladja directly home with me. He came from Poland and lived here on the street. All he possessed was a backpack, his scratched guitar, a pair of socks, a Kreuzberg T-Shirt, and a screwdriver. He moved in with me that day as if it were the most natural thing. He never spoke of his past, and just lived day by day. What do you want to watch? What? This is our new couch, that's the coffee table, now, I get us a TV. I hear nothing. I think this thing is broken. It's already old. What else do you want? Mm. A Goulash Cannon. We could eat goulash every evening on the roof and watch the sunset. There was still time before we get a cracking beat. Wait for me. Woo woo woo! Oh. I want to ride a Ferris wheel. What? Well, you asked me what I wanted. And that is it. Ferris wheel ride with you. I offer you the world and you want a Goulash Cannon and a ride on Ferris wheel, that's it? Yes. That's it. And now the proof. Let N be the element of N. X-1 to X, N, Y... and Z element of R. Let's show the first execution. Anyone knows? I love an unstructured execution. Shh. Good Morning. Good Morning. Um, sorry. Let's first show the execution. What are you doing here? I am longing. - And I'm busy. - The value of X... Can I have your pen? - You don't even have a pen? - Give it to me. Y. Because of the value of X greater than or equal to zero... then Y is... - Shh. - Come here, come here. Greater than or equal to zero. Greater than or equal to... zero. Oh. So, you are Ladja? Nice to meet you. Okay. Jule. And we now have something in common between the two... Excuse me! The ladies in the corner. Am I boring you? No, no, it's all very stimulating what you're telling. Right, Sonia? Very. That's exactly what I had imagined. Just like that. And never different again. You're pretty good at it. Oh God, I'm so hungry. I could eat a whole pig. - Go, go, go, go! - Oh! Woo woo! Oh, my God! Master, I need a falafel for this incredibly hungry woman. I need a falafel, absolutely. Well, how are you? Good to see you. May I introduce- This must be your latest victim. Thomasz. I'm Sonia. Hi. Sit down. Oh, the boss takes his time or what? So, I like that. Yeah. This is Shahin. This is Schnaps. - Here we go. - I'm Sonia, hi. Hey, what are you talking about? What? What do you mean? Yes, the funny thing you're saying, what is that? - Do you mean the language? - Yes, what is that? Hebrew. The language is spoken in Israel. Uh, Israel? What's that? - Tell me, where are you from? - Me? - Yeah. - I'm from Turkey. That's just 300 km of bird fly to us. No kidding. Let's visit. I'm serious, man. The young love. So naive. What are you doing here? I drank some tea, and then I listened to your sweet Hibish. Really nice. Your hair is nice and soft. Thank you very much. - Why naive? - Mm. You can not love someone you do not really know. That's rubbish. This is the reason why we're all... Everyone on this fucking planet has a problem. Nobody knows the other. The Turks do not know the Germans. The Christians don't know the Muslims. Men don't know women. And the Jews... - Nobody knows them at all. - L'Chaim! (To life!) - Cheers! - Cheers! Shahin, what about the gut, what about the gut feeling? - Does that count? - The gut feeling is stupid, my friend. You can not love someone you do not know. Well then, we're screwed. He's right. Ladja, I must confess something. All the toothbrushes in the crate, I had stole them... from men, whom I had slept with. Well, Ladja can not top that wild life. Can you, Ladja? I was... I know Thomasz from the pub. From what pub? - Well, from what pub? - Now, shut your mouth. - Hey, what shit are you talking about? - I, I was... Moment, moment, moment. You fuck guys? No, the guys fuck him. Ladja, this is not funny. I fucked with guys. So what? At least, I made some money from it. Could a guy fuck you in the ass? You're rid of her. But, you know what? You still have me. Everyone has you, fuffie. You fucker. Tell me, why did you make a fool out of me? What did you want to achieve? You can only love each other if you know each other. I just spared you months. I lied to you. Now, you can go. You are free. Do you think that's what I want, yes? Do you think I want to leave? Do you think I want to leave? I did not sell my ass. You're holding your face now. Shut your mouth! - Ladja! - Shut your mouth! Stop it! Stop! Stop. Don't say anything. You can only love each other if you know each other. I had realized that now. Promised? What? That you don't do that anymore. Hey. Promise me. Indians' word of honor. That is your new identity now. It was a cold morning after every club night. Sorry. Hey. Well? Ah, fuck! Drifting had its price. The reminders clogged the mailbox. - It's nothing. - I lost my waiter job. How many do you have? One, two... Four. Good. And you? Six. What is it? Are we calling? Yeah, now. - Who are those guys? - All good. - What was going on? - All good. Hey, Thomasz, what was just going down? - Money, money. - All good? Hey! Man, the money for all the drugs you got from me. Do you think the shit grows on trees? Fuck! The Pole must really sell his ass again. What? No, no. Hey. I can get the money. So, I'm really good at math, and I am tutoring and stuff. Is that easy? I do not believe that math can bring you 600 euros quickly. By the day after tomorrow. Apart from the 80 euros he still owes me. Until then, they will break the little one's dancing legs. Hey, there must be something. I know someone... who can use someone like you. It's a good job. And maybe, he'll give you an advance. Hello, I am calling about the job as- I am 20. Okay, good. Bye. And? Where are you going? I'll see if I'll get some more of them. I'm hungry. Yes, hello, this is Sonia Rossi. I'm calling about the job- Okay, all right. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye. It took me almost an hour by bus. Hard to believe that there are so many different Berlins existed. It was clear, when Thomasz gave me a job, it was not a 9 to 5. But, how far I could go, I didn't know then. I was excited. I was skeptical. But, part of me was very curious. Good afternoon. I'm Sandro, hey. - Sonia. - Mm-mm. Well, let's go to the living room. So, go through here, Miss. Sit down there. Yes, here. And? Have you done something like this before? No. Any, uh, special skill? Languages? Yes. Um... I can speak Italian and English. Mm, yeah. - Are you coming? - Oh, you make me so hot. - Mm. - Yes. You might get a little fumble at first, and so... and Jeanette will show you the rest. The guys pay me two euros a minute, a whopping 84 cents for you, so... hold them as long as possible. - Nice. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, isn't she cute? - Yeah, yeah. - So, you see her better. Mm, come, baby. Take off your jacket. It's so warm in here. - Okay. - Oh, yeah. - Touch her. - Mm. You like that, huh? - Uh-huh. - Come on. Let's take this off too. - Oh, yeah. - That's good. That's right, you're the boss. You are guiding his eyes. Oh, yeah. Yeah! Come, give your hand! Oh, oh! - Oh, I'm already totally wet. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Mm, oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, ah! Oh, yeah, baby! Oh, yeah. Man, now I almost missed the orgasm. They love the idea of coming together. Especially, the old guys. - Oh, God! Sorry. - I'm Jeanette. I'm Sonia. Funny that we hold your breast before we shake hands. You have real talent. But, always remember: Back straight, chest out. Don't be fooled by this wannabe entrepreneur. You're a pretty thing, you're still young. With your talent, you can earn 10 times as much in an hour elsewhere. He knows that. And that's how it started for me. In front of the camera, I called myself Masha. Shit, the camera is broken. Get moving, girl, huh? I was surprised myself how easy it was for me to get undressed for these guys. Oh oh oh! Oh, yeah. Woo! Woo, woo. Yes, yes, yes! To remind you, in terms of absolute amount... The chathouse and the school works were done separately. Sometimes, both together. Even if Sandro did not like it. The money problem was now off the table. But, there was a new one. I had no time for Ladja. Hey, Masha, I'm back. And as potent as an ox. Fortunately, he doesn't know that an ox is a castrated bull. While Ladja went dancing, I stayed home. I worked up to 14 hours. Suck your finger, Masha. And now, stick your finger in the ass and then smell it. Ladja thought I was working in a call center. But, he did not really care. Ladya! Watch out, watch out. Boom! - Now, do it. - Wait. Just do it. Oh, fuck that up, dude. I don't feel like it, man. Game over. How was that? You can only love each other when you know each other. A relationship can not work if one does not share life. Ladja and I lived past each other. We became strangers. Mm. Can you tell me what should I do with it? Oh, yeah. - Yes. - Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, oh, that's good, yeah. We saw each other less and less. Ladja stayed out longer and longer. This is Ladja's mailbox. Leave a message- And then, he didn't come home at all. Tell me, are you kidding me, Miss? Didn't we talk about this, huh? Man, Sandro, I have a test tomorrow. Are you kidding me? What if one logs in and you're studying here? Are you crazy? I told you, you should choose. Let me go. Hey, this doesn't work. Is that clear? Ooh! My God! I think it's the hottest that you so smart, dirty, naughty school girl. Little Masha! Let's do it on your school books. And I was very, very... naughty. You lousy, little asshole. That's me. You love just to come in here and disturb me while studying, right? You wanker! You dirty bastard! You pisser! Piss off, I'm done with you. It was enough for me. It was 24th of December. And with Christmas, for me, a fresh start had to be made. What did she say in the chathouse? "With your talent, you can earn 10 times as much in an hour elsewhere." Okay. Oasis, Anja here. My name is Sonia. Merry Christmas, Sonia. Yes, Merry Christmas to you. Dear, if you call for the job, you can go there today. Today? Um, yeah? Yes, great. See you later then. Okay, bye. Yes, nice, nice. That's fine, that's fine, my little one. Ah, you must be Sonia. Is this damn bell broken again? Oh, well. Come on, my dear. Oh, hello, Yusuf. Let him through. So... We have a little Christmas party here. We drink a little bubbly, quite enjoyable. - Nice. - By the way, I'm Anja. - Woo! - Girls! Come on. Girls, let me introduce you to Sonia. She's taking a look around today, right? I am the mama here, for all. Well, now take it in the middle, huh? Come here. Come here, baby. Come here. Hey. Hey. Why can't hookers count to 70? - Mm? - No idea. Because at 69, they already have their mouths full. That's good one. That's good. - Give me champagne, too. - Well, let's toast first. Cheers, huh? - Mm. - Girls, get dressed. Hurry up. Oh! I can't get into these things. Oh, I see. Are you pretty? - What? - Good. Man, Karl-Heinz! - It's a Christmas surprise! - Hi. Yeah. - Come on in. - Oh, yeah. It's been a while. - Yeah. - Hello, ladies. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - I'll take the one in the middle. No, that doesn't work, you. She still has puppy protection. Mm. That one. Yeah. - But you know I got a nip? - Oh. - Then the one on the far left. - Far left, yes. I already had enough surprises. Oh, man! - That's good, right? - It smells like sperm again! So... friend. Now, we're gonna play a game. On whom the bottle shows, makes the pencil test. And where the pencil sticks, she has to run on the balcony... and scream: I have saggy tits. So if it hits me, I'll run right out. And, weeh, ah. - Oh. - The new girl. - Hey, that was cheating. - No, no, no, no. No, no, I would have seen that. Hey, go on. - Well, now! - Come on, take off your clothes. Now, we want to see them. - Woo! Sexy tits. - Oh, yeah. Woo! - Oh! - Passed! I wish I had perky tits like that. - It's already finished. - Well, bye, ladies, huh? - Bye - And the gentleman. Yes, exactly. - Happy holidays! - But, that went quickly. Listen. The guy pushed twice and then came. Then he apologized because he was so fast. But, his wife would be down in parking lot looking for him. They were doing last Christmas shopping. Berlin is getting crazier and crazier. I say, Merry Christmas! Come on, play again. Play again. - And, ready? - Yes. - Oh! - Oh, no! Yes, I'm going. I'm going now. I have... sagging tits! - What was that? - Probably, some crazy bitch. All the lost souls if you ask me. Well, dear? You know, I also have sagging tits. But, I don't earn any money with them. You have a nice Christmas, Rosie. I wish you so. See you later, huh? See you later, Anja. Okay, Christmas in the brothel. But, hey. It's Berlin, isn't it? Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice Christmas, all right? You forgot to give me your number. It's in the phone book. I forgot your name. It's right next to the number. What was that just now? I saw you. From the outside. So... Uh-huh. And then... I want to see you a little more. So... I got on. Tell me, does your wife sometimes interfere with your marriage? She lives with her mother in France. Mm, well then. Joyeux Noel! I get off here. I don't. To be honest, I'd like to go out with my bartender. Oh, my God! A Goulash Cannon. Merry Christmas! Oh, yummy. Mm. Does it taste good? Very. Do you know what is missing now? - Mm-hm. - No. Oh, perfect. Wait. Um... I want you to play for me. What? I just carry my weed in it. Good... That was the most beautiful Christmas of my life. Ladja promised to get better and to find a job. There. - I wore this the first time. - That's a mess. The word "mess" is not necessarily something bad. I thought that's what it means because it makes the intention clear. Here. Put it on. I can't believe that I once fit in there. - Why did you actually start? - Oh, it just happened. I'll come here from the block. Anja was my babysitter. Can you imagine that? Well, and now I'm just saving for Australia. Oh, great. It's a normal job. Beautiful. Just as I thought. But, it's more, much more. Do you understand? You are... not a whore. In a sense, you are much more than a woman who only fucks. - That is asparagus pizza of the day. - Vera, I'm having a moment here. You're an actress, you're a diplomat, you're a psychologist, you are above everything. We are all feminists here. Hey, but I don't even want to fuck. I just want to... give massages and hand relaxation. Well, that's what we all said at the beginning. I once heard, only 1 in 1,000 makes it. Only 1 in 1,000 makes it? Yeah, yeah. But, have you ever wondered why? Nobody is standing at the door with a gun. There is good money. Finished. Out. Nobody says no. So, my flight to Australia is as good as booked. Have a look. At one time, I was full of punctures. And look at me today. I did it. I am I in 1,000. I am happy and clean. Come on. - This is Sonia. - And this... is Masha. Just in case. Don't do shit, yeah? You know, there must be better times. But, this is ours. Where is that from? TV News. All the girls here had a story behind them. Some were very tragic, others relatively harmless. I still did not know how my story would end. Now that my first client was sitting behind that door. But I knew, at that moment, that my beat would change forever. Won't you punish me? I was a very bad boy. Punish me. Punish me. Punish me! Punish me, please. Please, punish me. - You bad boy! - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Silk handkerchief? Thank you. Sorry for spurting on you. Can happen, right? And... thank you very much. I had a... very wonderful orgasm. Very much fun. Gladly. And how... was your Christmas? Was everyone there? Mom, Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, Children. Do you have children? Uh, no, no. It's nice to have kids. Very nice, actually. And, uh, remember, it's gonna be a storm today. Okay. Um, yes, the candle. - What? - The candle. Oh, uh, here. That tickles. Mine is bigger than yours. And what does that mean for me now? That you will be a great mathematician. New job, old problems. I worked in the brothel, things went great with Ladja, but something was always neglected. This time, it was the university. Cheers! Should I do anything else? No. You are doing everything right. I like cock. Hey. It's totally okay. I also like cock. Still, I was often at home alone. But only because, Ladja has finally been looking for a job. Sonia? Hey! Happy New Year! Yeah, I wish you, too. Did you just ring my doorbell? Just? No. No. No. You wanted to see me? No, I happened to be here and wanted to see if your house was still standing. It's still standing. Yes, it is. You, uh, you still have my wallet. Right, the wallet. So, you can also come by without the wallet. Anytime. Berlin, sometimes, makes you so lonely. I am not lonely. So, then. In my wallet, there is also my phone number. So, you can call me. Then I'll keep it a little longer, okay? Baby, I told you to have a drink, huh? - But, I did. - Yes, what? - Four bottles of Mate. - Well then, relax! How am I supposed to relax after drinking Mate? Come on, do it. Yes, it works. Oh, this is awesome! Oh, yeah. This is awesome! Great, great! At first, I always wondered, what kind of experiences these guys had... in order to develop these absurd fetishes. But, these fetishes were all so different. I remembered a sentence Mandy once said, Berlin is colorful, eh? Where did you get the clothes from? Well, from my grandma, of course, what do you think? I know what you're thinking now, but you don't have to worry about it. You know, she has a disease that causes her to forget everything. So, it doesn't bother her at all. Is it nice and furry? Oh, I'm so horny. Just put it deep in me. Come on. Come, come. Come on. Hey, Wolfgang. Hello, Masha. Shall I help you with that? Oh, that's very nice, but I think I can do it by myself. Go ahead and free yourself, yeah? Yes, doctor. Tell me, are you coming to the study group tonight? This sweet blonde Jacob, he's coming too. - Are you like him or what? - A little. So? Woo! My brother. Cheers! I had not thought about how fast all this could fly. You will be fucked by the clients just right, right. - Um... - Hey! Yes, do you already know Jenny? She's a colleague from work. I know. We'll go powder our nose, yeah? - Bye. - See you soon, yeah? Are you stupid? You can not just... What did you tell him? - Ladja does not know that I... - Ladja knows that you... - work in the call center. - Are you serious? Phew! Living in two worlds is not easy. And lies have short legs. Unlike me. Are you coming? Whoa! Oh, yeah. Look here! Madness, the money is gone! What? That can't be all gone. Who do you think paid for the drinks? How else did we do that, huh? And once again, the morning after. And again, no money. 3.50. Good appetite. Oh shit! I only have... - 2.35. - Mm-mm. No money, no chicken. Can't you maybe tear off a leg and I eat the rest? Is that how it works with you hookers? Without legs is cheaper? - Or what? - Masha, dear. Hello Wolfgang. We miss you with us, Wolfgang. Oh, dear. I've only got 1,200 euros from the pension. I need it for food and for you. And if one day, when doctors' bills flutter into my house, I'll be in the forest. I would love to give you a discount, but with us, the slack is full right now. It's okay. We both are strong souls. We can make it, right? Life is made for survival. This is so delicious, Wolfgang. Come every Saturday and I make roulades. Promised? In my age... all love goes into the culinary arts, or in memories, dear Masha. My real name is Sonia. Do you want a coffee? Um, yes. - Well, definitely- - Two coffees, please. Uh, yes, girls, what do you want now? Two coffees. Ah, two coffees. - Anyway, we met Jenny... - Mm. And I thought she might tell Ladja about... the "call center". Well, I was scared that this might come out. Yes and then? - Well, I- - Here you go. Two euros. Here. - Two beautiful ladies, two Euros. - Mm. - Have a good time. - You too. Well, I mean... okay. - Ladja- - Sonia? I get out. - What? - I'm going to get a decent job. I don't feel like it anymore on this eternal double life. I stop the shit. I'm going to the IHK and doing a training. I already have ideas. I just need an internship. If I have that, I can become a chemistry lab technician. And then, from morning to night, in a laboratory, working with pipettes and... - Yes, look. - You know, this is my dream. - The TV tower. - Um... Pretty big, right? - Who is that? - Uh, nobody, actually. - Actually? - What did you just say? Oh, it's not that important. - Come on, who's gonna be first. - Hey, wait! My dear. This is Alexa. Our new family member. - Hey - Hello. Hi. Wow! Are you nervous? This will help you. You're completely a different woman. This gives you a lot of freedom. Looks great. Someone wants to have threesome. Who wants to take it? Do we know each other? I don't think so. The first client with whom Masha had sex... Once Masha had started to fuck with the clients, it didn't stop at this one time. For sex, there was, at least, 50 euros extra. At first, Mascha only fucked with guys... who would have gone home after a night of partying. Then she let herself be screwed by those who would have left only when they had been completely drunk. And in the end, Masha and Sonia did not matter. Oh, baby! Shit! Study group. Shit! Fuck! - Oh. - Fuck, fuck, fuck. Really now? Really now? - Hi, Sonia. - Hi, Jakob. I have to go, alright? - Tell me, am I disturbing? - No. I am probably too late for the study group, right? Four hours. Mm. Ciao. Ciao. Ciao. He's got a big ass. Yes. But, there are such guys. Like... waiters from 'Bad Days', and... who has really great eyes, and... an awesome body. And such a smile. But, he doesn't even notice me. You know what? If I were a guy, I'd be in love with you. So would I, to you. You have such a secret. I like that. I'm a whore. Yeah, me too. Fuck! Really now? But, I thought you were working at this call center. The call center does not exist. Okay. But, it's not me who prostitutes. And who else? Masha. Yes, and who is that? The woman who borrows my body when transacting sex. It's a bit schizo, isn't it? Another self. It's actually quite cool. Have you done something to each other? - No, no, no. - Where is my little tranny? I realized that... money wasn't the only reason why I went to the Oasis. I had found something like a family here. Yes, do it. Are you kneading the testicles? Here, I was neither condemned for what I was, nor for what I did. - My balls are bomb. - I need strength. Oh, there's a guy asking for Vera. Yeah, where is she anyway? We all let ourselves become who we were, with false names... Well, you stick with your mother. But with real souls. What do we call it? - Hm? - Suppositories. Ah, I got the tranny! And meanwhile, I was more Masha than Sonia. And this one. - Or this one. - Girls? Girls, I, I have to tell you something. The Oasis has been sold. Yes, the doldrums was too long, right? Mm, don't make such a face. Life goes on. The doldrum was good. The business was so bad that we had to take whatever came. You almost killed me! Oh, nonsense, you won't go that fast. Take care of yourself. Baby, do you have light? In my bag. Where is it? There. There. Can you find it? There is only makeup here. And condoms. Light? I... You know, I feel like dancing. Can't we do that after you get off from the call center? Yes, of course. A little of... They're not my friends either. Well, not really. Hi, Masha. Hey. Nice to meet you here. Hey. And what's up? I wanted, tomorrow- Um, by the way, this is my friend Ladja. Ladya, are you a Jewish? - Are you a Polish? - Yes. How are you, my man? It's nice that we're here, right? I am a Ukrainian. How do you know Sonya? From her work. She gave me massages. She is very good at her job. So, you know her from a massage parlor, right? Something like that. Have a nice evening. What did he say? He said, you know each other from work. Are you colleagues or what? Yes, something like that. Tell me, are you stalking me? Is this the women's toilet? - Hey, wait. - What do you want? Man, Milan, you have everything. You have a flat, you have a wife, you have a child, you have a life! I don't want any of that anymore. I want... This is Jule, my best friend. Oh, hey. Milan. I know. Man, shit, Jule, I didn't know that you- Are you one of her clients too? Oh, sorry. Sorry! Come here. In two hours, I'll be out of here. Ladja, open the door! You got the key stuck. Ladja, open up. Open up, baby. Open up, man! Shit! Trouble? I'm kind of trapped. You know when I came to Berlin, I was the freest woman in the world, and now... now, I can't even get away from myself. I know that. And I simply jump. So, from the airplane. 10,000 meters. Just let go of everything. I don't have an airplane. But, you've been flying for a long time. What is it? Take off your shoes. Why? Why not? And, do you feel freer? What do you think? Let us... walk barefoot across... every street, run in every city in this world, and bathe in every well. Are you coming with me? I love you. Milan? In the end, Milan was just another client. Just like some people were into piss, he was probably into romance. Jule can not keep a secret. When I stood there, they looked at Masha. So much for friendship, yeah? You're talking about friendship? Hey, I'm sorry about Milan. - I knew- - You know what, Sonia? You're educating yourself way too much as well as too little. And that is what makes you so great, so unique. But also, so repulsive. You want to be a hooker, so pay the price for it. Hey, you bitch! It's all about the clap, but not the applause. Thank you. Some time later, the Oasis opened again. With a new face and a new name. "Ecstasy". Shit like that. - Hi. - Hey. Uh, what's going on? This is Sandro. He has now taken over the Oasis. And the first thing he did was fire Anja. Oh, kick someone! Isn't that our little Sonia? Masha. I knew you would be back. Well, as I always told you, you have to choose. I am glad that you have chosen us. We have four rooms. All four of you must be working at the same time. When the customers come in, they look at you and choose. I take a percentage and rent, the rest is yours. - That is illegal. - No. It's cool. This is Berlin's first brothel that you hookers are self-employed. You know we are totally in the doldrums right now? Yes, then you have to stop lowering the price, darling. Yeah? Should you have studied business administration better? Ah, 80, minimum. 80 euros is too much. 30. No. Okay, there are cheaper ones, we're leaving. I know where there are much cheaper. Okay, okay! 40. Agreed. Come on! - Oh, yeah! - Oh, yeah. Fuck, baby. Oh, shit! - Oh! - You stupid! Shit! What is your real name, Mandy? Sandy. No, no, no. God! That was just a joke. My real name is Bernadette. You... want Sonia and Bernadette go to Australia next month? I think I'll stay here a bit longer. And if I work another year or so, then I have more to spend down there. You never know what will happen. Right? Here, now piss on it. Are you stupid, or what? There is no Sonia here! Leave him, leave him. There she is. My own little hooker! Hey. Do you want to fuck my girlfriend? 30 euros. Saving offer. All you can fuck! - Ladja, please. - Hey! Hey, you! Do you want to fuck? - What are you looking at? - No, Ladja! Mm? Ladja... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You left me alone. It was my choice. You're not coming here now and condemn me. Not you! You can only love one another if you know each other. No, Sandro! Can you stop the time for us again? For me? It is too late. For both of us. Believe me. Once a hooker, always hooker. I know what I'm talking about. Fucking Berlin is a modern babel. We all want to live together, but don't speak the same language. Hey! Hello, Sonia. Can you lend me some money? Only this once. Huh? It started like an intoxication. I wanted to test my limits... and passed them. Burnout is for beginners. I have a fuckoff. Berlin is not a city. Berlin is a rhythm. In an endless loop. I do not know when I lost my rhythm. Hey. Hey, I gave you the money, so you don't have to do the job anymore. - It's okay. - So that you're free. Take better care of your valuables, okay? I already have a new one. Take care. My beat is now recovering from all the dropouts. It's beating alone again. Well... not quite.
