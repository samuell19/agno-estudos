And you know what I'm talking about, but there are some out there, that are strictly on the hype, and the look. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. The thing that gets me though is that I'm busting my butt, going to every late night jam, and singer showcase in town. Really perfecting my craft. I have respect for the music. While you got these other girl groups, don't know a thing about music. They're making all the money. Look, been there, done that. And the t-shirt wasn't all that cute either. But no, no seriously. I know you are gonna be just fine. And don't you worry about all these no-talents that's coming up, because what you have, is what God gave you. And nobody can take that away from you. Yeah. So you know what? You're gonna be fine. Not that it matters, but I need to make some real money. Hey, girls. I really thought he was gonna hook you up, you know? Mind if I join you, Dylan?

Can't stand Jew fucks like him talking about how much money they have. Like I give a fuck. Right. Talk about racist, Jew fuck? You know what I mean. I got nothing against Jewish people. It's just that it seems like no matter how much I try, some fuck head like him, or it could be a girl, talking about some stupid cause I'm white and she's black. They got a fucking problem. I can't stand that! So sick of it! I'll say, you know, maybe we should stop trying so hard. There's plenty of the women out there, dude. I meet them every day.

You know I's got to just come here and fuck with ya. Hey. (man sighing) Man. After I finished up that two year bit, I was like, fuck the bullshit, man. There's too many young niggers out there shooting shit up for no reason. Yo, so I went around the state, singing and shit. Spent some time in Europe. I'm trying to get a record deal. Yeah, I hear that. My man always had the singing skills to pay the bills. Always had on some fine ass, sisters. Ah! Just like a regular Marvin Gaye. Yeah. I'm with that. (man chuckling) Yeah. So what's up with the gears, yo? Like y'all ready for war and shit. I'm glad you asked, my brother. War's exactly what we all about. We're taking over where the Black Panthers left off, only we taking it a little further. Ain't that right, black soldiers? Yeah. Yeah. We are all members of the New Black Revolution. This brother, named Trevor, turned me on to the organization. I've always hated white people. Ever since I was in a third grade, this big, white non-sun taking cracker just stomped the shit outta me. Whipped my ass bloody. Just because I helped this little, blonde haired, blue eyed girl get up. Cause she was beat up by her brother and his friends, telling me I'm just a dirty little nigger, and I should know my place. I got the medicine for that madness. You down with the program, or what? Man. Man, it's too extreme for me. (man chuckling) That's cool. I ain't gonna fuck with you. I know you ain't no joke. I'll keep in touch. Yeah. All right? All right, bro. Peace, man. Let's go, soldiers! I'm starving! Let's go sit down somewhere. Can we go? Eat where? The Indian restaurant that we passed? That one was cute. I like that one. With what? Well, don't you have any money. No, I paid the rent. Besides, what do we have to go out to eat for? I mean, why don't you try cooking for a change? You know? You know. (woman scoffing) Whatever. What? You can't cook now? One minute! (woman sighing) Hey, girl. Hey! What's happening? Uh, just trying to hook this place up. Whoa! Yeah! This is gonna be hard. Can I help? Put me to work! You sure can. Take your little self over there. I'm fixing the chair, get the materials, and get a paintbrush. Yeah, girl. You see, I've been working, right? Yeah. I am so tired. Man, this feels good right here. Just even sitting on this hard ladder. (women chuckling) All I need right now is a massage, a glass of wine, and a good man, with dinner ready. And this place cleaned up! Amen. Girl, what are you amening about? You got a man, and a cute one too. And a cute one too! Hello? Is anybody home? What's wrong with you? Is everything okay? Yeah. No, I don't know. We've been fighting a lot lately. (upbeat hip hop music) I don't know, but you're so caught up in this girl. I love Debbie and everything, and she's so talented, but it's like, hey, take a step back, dude. Take a look at yourself and see how this is ruining your life. This girl, this girl has got you lost. She said you all tied up and confused. I think you losing sight at why you came here in the first place. I'm tired of never having any money. I'm always broke. I don't have money for clothes. For food. For me. You know? Wasn't supposed to be like this. You know what? I know what you should do. What? Get a damn job! Go make it happen. You gotta find yourself again, man. Get refocused. Easy for you to say, you know, you're the one with the money. You have nine to five, okay? I have no fucking money. I don't believe he said that. What makes you so special? It's like my career, you know? Do what I have to do. How am I supposed to get a record deal? By working that much harder at it, Debbie. You know what, how Tony puts up with you, I will never know. He puts up with me because that is the deal that we may coming here. At least just starting out. Right. And that was when you first got here? When you thought you had a record deal? Debbie. I made a promise to her, and to me. We're gonna make this happen. There's a whole lot of people out there that wanna see me fail. So I go back to Boston, like a, like a cry baby. Oh the big actor didn't make it. The big actor didn't make it. Well you know what, I'm not gonna let that happen. I had too much fucking pride. Wait a second. What ever happened to Tony the actor? That's not my fault producers lied to me. That's not the point, Debbie. I mean, the point is Tony is working his off trying to support both of you working as an extra two days a week, doing this whole bike messenger thing. I mean, look, Lord knows you deserve to make it. You do. But until then, Debbie, if you love him. I don't know. I think I do, sometimes. And other times I can't stand the sight of him. Yeah but, all couple go through that. That's the whole, couple thing. That's just called a relationship. That's all that is. I mean, you know, it's work. That's all a part of it. I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I need to do to make this happen. I don't know what it is gonna be yet, but it's gonna happen. See, that's the spirit! That's the determination. Yo know, it's not all about her. It's about you too. I'm gonna figure something out. See, that's the old Tony. That's the Tony that I know. Come on, man. Let's go get some margaritas or something. How'd you get to be such Miss Know-It-All? No, it's not about me being Miss Know-It-All. Although, I do know a lot of stuff. (woman laughing) But, it's about me being my sister's keeper. Okay? You're my girl. I got to look out for you. You know what? I would expect you to do the same thing. You know I will. You better. Listen, it's not personal. I like this man, you understand? Real Soul does not selling labels down. Listen, listen, No. All you gotta do is, No, no, no. It's going down, man. Okay? This is a personal decision. Passion is paying. That's where I'm going.

(woman singing softly) (man sighing) Look, Tony and I, we have our problems. We're still together. I'm sorry. Then what are you doing here? I've been asking myself the same question. You know I wrote a song about us. About you actually. A love song. I just couldn't finish it. At first I thought it was because I was trying to rush the song too quick. But as I got to know you, I realized that no matter what line I used on you, no matter how smooth I tried to be still be, you'd still be with him. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. (man sighing) But you know what? Maybe this time I'll let you slide. But next time, (woman giggling) I'm not gonna be so lenient on you. Thank you for understanding. Thanks for being a friend. I can't believe I can't find anybody. In this big city, I can't find one person. Maybe you somebody on the label, that you've already signed? I can't use anybody on the label. Even Sabotage. I can't use anybody there. And how about the girl you said you heard a couple of weeks ago at that club? What girl? I dunno know. You said you sounded like an angel, or something. Wait a minute. Where was I? Um? What girl was that? I dunno. Downtown? Rocco's! Rocco's. Baby, you are, you are the bomb. You know that? Am I? You are a woman. I'm telling you! (woman giggling) Every time I'm down, you think of something. Cause I'm your baby. You know where I'm gonna take you, when I sign this girl? Where? I'm thinking right now. Think, Jamaica. You see any sand, girl? Think the Bahamas. What? Think Bermuda. It's getting hot! Think Jamaica. It's getting hot in here, baby. Antigua. Oh, you working for that, aint you? (woman laughing) Donna's friend, Hassan. He just got a big movie deal, just because he did a showcase. Those showcases, they're bullshit! It's a scam! You have to give them like, 300 bucks. So you go see these big agents, and he's big casting directors, you give them your money. They put in their pocket, you give the performance of a lifetime. Every single ounce of blood, sweat and tears you have inside you. And what do they do? They clap like a bunch of fucking seals, like this. And they go home with our money in their pocket. A couple of hundred dollars richer. Pathetic. Don't get mad at me. I didn't make the rules. It's not my fault. Okay. Let me tell you for a second what I'm going through. I know all too well what you go through. I've known it for six months, since we've moved here! Since you were supposed to be a big star! You haven't been doing anything. I've been doing. I've been the one doing, doing, doing. And you know what? I'm sick of it. I'm sick of struggling. I want my piece of the pie. That's why I, That's why, what? What? That's why I got these fucking credit cards to pay for your fucking clothes and your stereo! I'm sick of it! Tony. What is this? Nevermind what the fuck it is. It's paying our way, all right? It's paying our way! It's for you. (woman arguing) It's for your TV. It's for your friends! You're gonna get us put in jail! You out of your mind? No, I'm not out of my mind. Yeah! Maybe I am of my fucking mind! And you know what? I'm getting out of here. This is what you call taking care of business? Well, what have you done? This is how you're gonna get? What have you done? You tell me what you've done around. I'm the one that's out there trying to get us someplace! You aint getting us shit! I'm out there busting my ass! Everybody's, Stolen credit cards? That's not busting your ass! That's a free meal ticket, man. You knew what we were getting into when you came here! I thought we came on here together.

The governor and the mayor of the city are so worried and in fear of us, they are so preoccupied about the $13 billion that tourists spend in the city, eating at our hotels, sleeping in our beds, and buying their Broadway shows, they won't even speak to the real citizens. It is time for you, the real people, the true people, to stand up and be counted. (upbeat funky music) (horns honking) (woman sighing) Debbie, what did you think he was doing? You had to know something.
