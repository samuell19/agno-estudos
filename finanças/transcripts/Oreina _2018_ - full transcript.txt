THE DEER High time, Khalil. - Did you bring it? - Yes. - Bye. - See you. - I told you to come tonight. - I can't. - Who the hell do you think you are? - I can't come tonight. A quarter. - You'll get it tonight. - I can't tonight. Go eat shit, you fucking Paki! I ain't got nothing for you, asshole! Take it easy, he's just a kid. - What happened to you? - I fell off. It's your own fault, stop riding that damn bike. I've told you not to show up here on your bike. You can hardly feel it. Even the tiniest burr can tear a net. What the hell do they teach you at school? Take the can. And clean your arm up. Nothing doing here. Does the deferment work in my favor or does it...? Right, so if... If I confess to harassment, will they drop the other charges? Well, it may be better. There's no way I can go back to the university. We'll let things cool down. We'll see. Lend me your cell. - What's that? - It's fucking great. So, will you come later? Maybe. Come on. - It's a shitty job. - But it's a job. She's a nice kid, but she thinks she's cool. - I like her. - Sure, she's just your type. - Come on, let's go. - All right. Yeah, see you later. I'm leaving next year. Where will you go? I don't care, London, anywhere. You've got a job here. Sure, at my dad's gas station. I'll take you home. No, not today. - Come on, one more drink. - No, thanks, I'm fine. I don't want any more. - Come on, one more. - I said no. Jesus, José Ramón, don't be so rough. Be careful. Darling, I've got to go. It's raining, I'm taking your raincoat. Dad, it's done it again! You just do it wrong. It's stuck. Move away. Hey, we're not in a library. If you want to read, buy it. How about five Euros? No, I just have fifty. Okay. Just leave it open. Excuse me. Do you have an aspirin? I asked at the gas station, but they don't have any. - I'll take a couple if I may. - Go right ahead. How much? No, nothing. Thank you. - Aren't those two brothers? - They are, but... Careful, it's hot. - It sure is. - I told you, but you never wait. - I'm off, bye. - May God be with you. And protect you. You're back on that fucking bike. How do you expect me to get here? I'll finish these and we'll go. Give me the hose, Khalil. Not that one, the other one. The moon is nearly full tonight, the sea will be rough. Let's get the nets ready. Thank your mom for me. But tell her. I bet you never do. My mother used to pack my lunch in one of these. - In a Tupperware? - Yes. The last years I was at the factory. - How long did you work there? - I wasn't there the whole time, but on and off, thirty years. And during the off time? In jail. Seven years altogether. Four years the first time, three the next. Haven't you brought some beer? It mustn't have been easy for you to be behind bars. It's not only about losing your freedom. Besides, I didn't care much about freedom. So what was it? I had a girl. They convinced her to leave, to go and study away from here. And she left. - She didn't come back? - Once in a while. But I was mostly in jail when she did. And then, she stopped coming, What is it? No, nothing. I've got gas. WE CAN MEET ANYWHERE, JUST TELL ME WHERE. DO YOU KNOW THE TRUEBA MOVIE THEATER? YES. HOW ABOUT THE 10 P.M. SESSION? HOW WILL I RECOGNIZE YOU? I'LL CARRY A PLASTIC BAG. Screen two. 6.20 Euros. - José Ramón Sarasola? - No, try the other bell. Wait here, please. José Ramón Sarasola? We've had a complaint. A young man has been seen fishing. In the park, I mean. - Someone gave us your name. - I don't know anything. My fishing license is up to date. Besides, you guys have already checked it. Have you got a license to catch elvers? Elvers? That's like having a license to catch angels. You can't catch what doesn't exist. Fishing in the park is forbidden, even with a license. And you know nothing, of course. You mean me? I don't fish or hunt. By the way, you always work alone. - Why did you bring him? - I have to. Apparently, you're dangerous. I want to sell as soon as possible. Yes. Sure. Sure, I'll go as soon as possible. Yes, all right, bye. Hi, is José Ramón around? I don't know, I haven't seen him. If you do, tell him I dropped by. - Sure, but who are you? - I'm Khalil. You know who I am. Want something to drink? A beer? Have you got a Coke? I suppose. I'll check. Sorry, I've forgotten your name. Khalil. Your brother hardly ever talks about you. How did you meet José Ramón? In the marsh, when I was a kid, after I got here. When was that? We came from Western Sahara when I was six. First we went to Lerida, but my dad got offered a job in a factory over here. - He liked it here. - What about you? I don't really care, I haven't seen much more. Your dad still works at the factory? My dad died five years ago. Cancer. What is it, you ran out of questions? Sorry. I shouldn't have asked you so many questions. I don't mind, I like to talk. José Ramón is no talker. You two don't seem like brothers. He's paying for my school. Did you know that José Ramón worked in a factory too? He's always been very good with his hands. According to mum, if you know how to use your hands, you'll always manage. - What about you? - Me? I'm totally useless. Do you have a computer? Thanks for the Coke. Yes, I do. I have a computer, I mean. Don't trust him. Go feed the pigeons. Christ! You're late. I know you're here! I've seen the bike. What did he say? How much for the deer head? Tell him it's not for sale. When I met your brother, you didn't live here. You know as well as I do when I came. Where were you before? I spent the last 15 years in Paris. But this is my home. What did you do in Paris? I'm a university teacher. Well, I was. What do you teach, biology? What makes you think I teach biology? You've got a lot of bird books. And binoculars. I'm a philology teacher. And a translator. I don't know what philology is. - Philology is the study of... - Why did you come back? I don't know. I really don't know. I was planning on selling this and going back to Paris. But I haven't sold it. Who knows? I've got to go. Thanks for letting me use your computer. Here. That's for me? Khalil! Come here. Your share from the last few nights. Don't go and buy a bike. Martin gave it to me. Bye. What's up, Khalil? 1.45 Euros? Yeah. That's all the gas that fits in the tank? Can you sell me fifty Euros worth? I'm out. Even for a joint? - Nothing, really. - Christ. Bye! The last one, José Ramón, I'm closing. Faggot! Faggot! You couldn't stand it, could you! You want to fuck me again, is that it? But Khalil knows what you are. He's known for a long time! Faggot! Faggot. Martín, Martín! Martín, call an ambulance! An ambulance! I don't know. The doctor hasn't said anything. - Hi. - Hello. - Are you studying? - I've got exams. You do? Yeah, the ones I didn't pass. A lot of them? My mom says that if I studied instead of going to the marshes... He'd never say that. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow. For how long? I don't know yet, I have to sort things out in Paris. If anything happens here, they'll let me know immediately. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. FOR SALE
