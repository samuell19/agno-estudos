They say it's only a myth. . But my father saw it... That's when he took it. There's a Laputa in Gulliver's Travels: but Swift made it up Dad drew this. He said the abandoned palace was full of treasure. But nobody believed him. Until he died, they called him a liar. But my father never lied. I m building a real plane. I'm going to find Laputa...

Just like when you landed The opening looks so tiny. I hope the Boss and the engineer aren't in any trouble. Aw, don't worry. Miners aren't exactly wimps Let's find the way out. These mines are ancient. Tunnels everywhere. I m so happy I was starving I've still got an apple and some candy. It's like you have a magical bag that holds everything. Gondoa? That's so far north. Yes. Both my parents died, but they left me the house and the fields, so I was getting by alone. . The guys with dark glasses kidnapped you. That guy was one of them? Who can they be, calling in the army? The Dolas and the other guys, all want the stone But I had no idea it had mysterious powers It was always in our family. Mother left it to me when she died She warned me never to show it or give it to anyone. We're both orphans, aren't we? I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this. When you fell from the sky my heart was racing I knew something wonderful had begun. Little demons... little demons. Uncle Pom! He's really great Uncle Pom We've lost our way. Now that little demon sure looks like Pazu... with a little girl demon beside him. Pirates are a fter us. And the army How very extraordinary... Drink up. Thank you. Have you always lived underground? Why no, no. The rocks have been astir... That's when I like to be down here. The rocks astir...? Rocks speak very softly... Wonderful. . Look up. They were ordinary rocks until. . How pretty. Here, let me show you... It's gone. These rocks contain Volucite Volucite? As soon as it's exposed to the air, it becomes ordinary stone. It's glowing. Oh, my gracious! That's a Volucite crystal, my dear. I've never seen one before. That's why the rocks were stirring. This stone has mysterious powers. I thought only Laputans knew how to make Volucite crystals. Laputans... They used Volucite to send a magnificent island alof t... Laputa did exist, Sheeta! It really did! Does the island still exist? Uncle Pom? Dear, would you mind covering the stone? Its power overwhelms me. What's wrong... My grandfather told me. The rocks shif t when Laputa floats overhead. If you went up to the sky then, you'd find Laputa! My father was telling the truth! Young lady: :. Your stone is most powerful... I know it as one who has spoken to rocks all my life. A stone so powerful brings happiness, but it can also bring misery. What's more, your stone is the work of men. I just thought I should... It's not true! That stone's already saved Sheeta twice! Amazing! Laputa really does exist! It's gone. Let's go back to the ship When it's this quiet, it's best to stay put I'm hungry: :. It's all clear Let's go. Thank you, grandpa. Look af ter yourselves. Look at those clouds! Beyond those clouds is an island we've only dreamed of. Here I come! I know I'm going to find Laputa! Pazu... I haven't told you everything. My family had a mysterious ancient name which came with this stone. My name is Lucita, Lucita Toelle Ur... Laputa... Laputa... So you mean. It's the army! Run! Underground! Don't move! How dare you! Pazu! Let me go! Pazu! Pazu! We've apprehended them So much trouble Open up, open up! Sheeta... Company, fall in! Shape up! Squeeze the brat! : :. She'll talk! Spoken like a man in uniform In your haste, you risk everything. If we'd mobilized the army sooner, Dola wouldn't have had a chance. She managed to decipher your third-rate code How dare you! My organization will handle this You concentrate on mobilizing the troops when the time is ripe. Muska! Remember, I command the search for Laputa! Of course But I have my orders from the government That pencil-pushing upstart! Have a nice rest? Where's Pazu? Let me see him! No interest in pretty clothes? Don't fret about Pazu. His stubborn head is harder than mine Come, I have something to show you. Enter. What is it... A mechanical soldier with vast destructive power Had he not fallen from the sky, no one would have believed in Laputa He's not of this earth. Our science can't even identify what material he's made of. Look... Don't be afraid. He's long dead Look at that. This insignia was carved on your fireplace It's on this stone, too. The stone works only in your hands. It will protect you and guide you back to Laputa. I know nothing of this! Take it if you like Just leave us alone... You imagine Laputa's like Treasure Island... Fearsome powers thrust Laputa into orbit. Their dreaded empire once ruled the earth! Even you can appreciate that when such an entity roams the skies, it threatens Peace. I need your cooperation. You must know how to make the stone guide us to Laputa. I really don't know! Please let me see Pazu! I intend no harm, but his fate rests with you. The boy goes free if you assist us, Lucita. . ... Toelle Ur Laputa. But how: :. Ur means ruler in Laputan, Toelle means True, Queen Lucita, rightful heir to the Laputan throne Out! Sheeta Pazu, are you hurt? I'm fine. You? Did they do anything horrible? My dear Pazu, we misjudged you. Accept our apologies. We didn t know how gallantly you protected her from the pirates. Sheeta, what did you... Pazu, I beg you, forget about Laputa. What! Sheeta will aid us in our search for Laputa. I understand how you feel, but forget about her Is this true, Sheeta? But we... I'm sorry for all the trouble. . I'll never forget you I can't believe it... Sheeta, we swore! Good bye Sheeta! Wait, Sheeta! Be reasonable. Act like a man. Sheeta! Here's a token of our gratitude. It's yours. Only you can recall the words that will waken this stone: :. If you keep your promise, you, too, shall be free. Pazu... Mama it's Pazu! He's back! Pazu We were so worried. You just disappeared. And the girl? Forget it Pazu! Let me go! What are you doing! Put a lid on it! Nice place you got, kid. Get out! This is my house! Oh, come of fit. Can't even protect a little girl... He's got gold! Sold her for money, huh. No! I wouldn't do that! You let them pay you of f... Sheeta told me to. . So... So you gave in and crawled home. You call yourself a man! You talk big, but you're a fter Sheeta too. But of course, we're pirates. Pirates hunt for treasure. They're the strange ones. What's the girl to them? You think she'll get out alive? Sheeta told you to leave? They threatened her, so she tried to save you. How do you know, mama? 50 years of being a woman. She steels her heart to save her man. How touching. Reminds me of my youth: :. You boys want to marry, look for one like her. So... that girl... Will grow up to be mama? Don't even bother switching codes... Calling the battle cruiser...? They'll pack her up and take off. Time is short. Dinner's over. Move out. Yes, mama. Going a fter Sheeta? I want the crystal, not the girl. The stone's no good without her Can't I go with you, Ma'am? I have to help Sheeta! Not so fast. Do it on your own nickel You're right, if I was clever and strong, I could've defended her. Please, I don't care about treasure. Listen to him: :. Shut up! But you could probably help us with her. Leave all this behind? I know You sure? Yup! You've got 40 seconds. Be well. Tie this to your belt. You boys wait on the ship. A magnificent vessel. Has the girl come through? I need a little more time Forget it! We'll squeeze it out of her up there. We depart at dawn, with the girl. Hurry up, it's almost dawn! Sheeta! Whatever shall we do... Sheeta, listen, I'm going to teach you a magic spell for trouble A magic spell? Yes. These are old, old, old, secret words. They mean help me rekindle the light. Perfect. Just as the ancient books described. This is the sacred light. Sacred light... ? What are the magic words? Tell me. It's moving! The robot it's alive! Hello! Help! It's alive! It's the robot! The robot? It's coming this way. Run! Retreat! Retreat! Incredible! I see! It's the light! The sacred light broke his seal! This is the way to Laputa! Come! No! He's going to fly! It's pointing to the sky... It's showing the way to Laputa Hurry! Use explosives! But don't blow up the ship! Hello, hello, hello! What is this! Good. We're connected This is Colonel Muska The robot's cut our lines I've assumed emergency command It's a fter the girl on the tower. Take it down on sight. Prepare to fire. Hurry! Hurry up! Fire! Hurry! We did it Get the girl Is she dead? Get up! She just fainted. Stand! It moved: :. What's that! Must be a battle. Let's go, Ma'am! Captain, to you! Lower, Charles. Stop! Stop it! Please! Mama, Goliath's moving. We're going directly into the crossfire Regroup! Look, there's Sheeta! Where? Straight ahead, she's on top of that tower! This is a job for a woman! Cover me Sheeta! I'm coming, Sheeta! Pazu! Fly closer, lady! Pazu! Let me go! Sheeta! Ma'am! Pazu Pazu! Climb! Last chance! Grab her on the fly! Pazu! Here goes! Move! Darn! Sheeta! What's Goliath up to! A smoke screen... Where's the robot! Destroyed. The girl went that way. What! Put out the fire! Organize a search party! We haven't lost the sacred stone. Its light points to Laputa. . Inform the General, we'll depart for Laputa as planned. How nice... I can't believe she'll grow up to be just like mama... There's your valley... Back where we started. Lady, please take us aboard Call me Captain! What use are you without the crystal? We'll work. I want to see Laputa for myself. Don't want any treasure, just to see Laputa? Suspect motives for boarding a pirate ship. Are they coming with us, mama? One false move and you're shark bait! Excellent! No more laundry or cleaning duty! Or dish washing! Or potato peeling! Can you make pudding? Yes... I like mincemeat pie. I eat, um, um, anything! Enough out of you! When will you boys ever grow up! Get off! Canvas. It's made of cloth And don't tear it. Hurry up, it's crowded in here! Hurry, this way! I hate dawdlers. You're with me! Pazu! I don't bite. Come. You're not here for fun. What an engine. Now where'd he go? Pops! Pops! Got you an assistant. Don't holler. I hear you. He's tougher than mama. Be careful. My hand doesn't fit. This gasket? Name? Pazu. The crystal pointed nearly due east... You sure about that? I could see the sunrise from the tower. Lt's the harvest season now, so the sun rises just south of due east. The light pointed to the left of the sun rose. Good answer. Any luck? Not a peep. Blocking their radio transmissions.... Mama, Goliath's faster than us. We're upwind of them. If we get a lift on the trade winds. This is an Asian calculator. Windspeed is 10: :. And... I think it'll work. OK listen up! Goliath's on its way to Laputa. We're on their tail With these winds, I expect contact tomorrow Ten gold pieces to whoever spots her first! Ten! Whatever we find, I m sure Laputa has riches enough for any pirate gang! Earn your keep, boys! Course 98 speed 40 You're useless in that get-up. Wear these Your station. Sweet... You serve five meals a day. Go easy on the water. Get to work, you idiots! Yes I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet I've never cooked on an airship... What is it... Sweet... I thought I'd give you a hand in my spare time. Why thank you. Can you put those dishes away? Happy to obli. You said your stomach hurt... I've got some free time. Can l: :. Move Some stomach ache, jerk! Hey, can I help... You've changed, chasing the likes of Goliath... But it's pointless. It's Laputan treasure I'm af ter. They're certainly nice kids... Get to the point, you crank They're too upright and honest to ever respect you What's that! No, I mean... Check... Good: :. Good... Seconds anyone? Seconds! Seconds! Seconds! Hey shake a leg. It's your watch Take it, it's cold. Watch? Darn cold! Go on up. My turn. Great. Sheeta! That was scary! Beautiful. Sheeta Get in Can t sleep? Nice and warm... Look out behind. Pazu I'm really, really, scared. I really don't want to go to Laputa. I hope we never find Goliath. The light really did point that way. About the robot? Poor thing. I never dreamed that little spell could... I learned lots of other spells. To help find things, cure the sick. And one I must never, ever use. Never, ever use... ? A spell of destruction. I had to learn bad ones so the good spells had power But not to use... I was so scared, I couldn't sleep... That stone should be locked away They hid it in the fireplace. Only wore it for weddings My mother's and grandmother's and great great grandmother's. I should have thrown it away. You're wrong. We only met because of the stone. Throwing it away won't change anything Airships are improving. Someone will find it. I don't know what to do, but if Laputa is so dangerous, it's sure not for the likes of Muska Besides, if we run now, they'll hunt us forever But don't become a pirate for me. I won't become a pirate Dola understands. She's nicer than she looks. Once things are settled, I'll take you to Gondoa. I want to see where you were born, the valley, the yaks... Pazu... What's that! Below us, look! Goliath, right below us! Come about! Do we have to hurry? I hate to lose them. We can't catch them in this fog. We'll get them They won't go far Steady as she goes Farther north than I thought. There's no time, so listen If we lose Goliath, it's all over. Follow them in the crow's nest. What do I do? It turns into a glider. See the crank? Yeah. Turn it clockwise. Once it's locked, the upper lever spreads the wings. Use the wire to stabilize them. Figure out how to steer as you go! Sheeta, you there! Get back down here Why? Because you re a girl! But so are you! Besides, I'm a mountain girl with sharp eyesight Sheeta! Please Pazu agrees. Once you're alof t, the voice tube won't work. See the head set? You mean this... Wow... OK. I ll give it a try. Release us Here goes They re gone Slipped behind clouds. Stay alert. They could be anywhere. Hold on tight What's wrong! We're fine Ran into a gust of wind. We'll keep watch Scared? No. I'm getting the hang of it. Rough skies ahead Get the rope from my bag, Sheeta. Tie yourself to me. The mercury's sinking mama... Lousy luck. Storm coming up. . How long 'til dawn? One more hour. It's dawn. Strange that the sun's rising on that side... I know! We're supposed to be heading east Bridge! What! We're heading north? The compass is pointing east. The shif ting winds must have put us of fcourse. Look! What is it? Goliath? Lt's a cloud. A huge one: :. A cloud? It's headed for us! A castle in the sky: :. We're headed into a low pressure system. Turn her away, full speed! It's sucking us in. Hold tight, we can't help! I can't steer! Where's your brute strength. Engine's burning up Stop whining! Do something! We're clearing the clouds! Sheeta, the ocean! The Dragon's Lair! So this is the Dragon's Lair... Dad said, that wind blew in opposite directions. Look out, a wall of wind! Help! It's sucking us in! Don't give up! Be a man! Bridge! Laputa's inside! What was that! Dad saw Laputa inside the Dragon's Lair. Ridiculous! It'll blow you to smithereens! Pazu! Look. Just what we need. Let's go! It's the path dad took. He made it back Into the Dragon's Lair we go! Got 'em! Our ship's in danger. Retreat. Stay the course The light's pointing right for the clouds. Laputa's in there. Stay the course. We ll find a way in. Here we go, Sheeta! Sheeta, Sheeta! Are you all right? Look... Laputa...? Oops. Wait. I tied it really tight My hands are shaking... We did it! Birds... Where is everyone... Coming to greet you? But I don't have the stone I'll use a knif e. What are you doing! Wait. Please don't break that. We need it to get home A flycatcher's nest! He's protecting the nest I'm glad no eggs were broken. The birds aren't afraid. - Follow. - You understand? I feel it. It's a city. . But we're inside. You can see the sky... A city so advanced... Why did it: :. A grave... I wish I could read the writing. Flowers. Do you tend them? Another robot! It broke a long time ago. Must've been the gardener... ...who protected this place ever since the people went away. You picked flowers for the grave. Thank you. Are you all alone? Are there any other robots here? He doesn't seem to be lonely He's got friends and birds'nests to look a fter. This way! This section's been destroyed They got Tiger Moth. I hope the pirates are OK Look! They're prisoners! They hang pirates. We must help them. Let's go! We found a way in. Mountains of treasure. Wow... Want some? I'll give you plenty... of rope. Have you reported we found Laputa? Just about to. Make the code good and complicated Hey! No looting! The perfect distraction for those idiots. What amazing roots Can you climb trees? It looks sa fe How horrible... If they reach the garden. The only way to save this. Is to get the stone back I see why the clouds parted. Otherwise they never could have landed Was it my spell... Muska was right. The seal's broken, and the kingdom's waking up. It's welcomed the visitor with the stone But Muska will become the king. He's got much worse in mind But what do I do with the stone when I get it back. That spell: :. Spell. you don't mean. I see a way I'll go first. It's here somewhere. Please God. . This is it! Lt's that kid. Oh, no! Don't shoot, capture her. Well if it isn't the little princess Sheeta! Shoot! What is it, Colonel? The last of the pirates There's one right under you. Yes sir! Search!
