* Oh, big chiefs in the clouds, answer me. Geronimo? Sitting bull? Miss pocahontas? Oh, rain-in-the-face, please Pierce the veil. Oh, big chiefs in the clouds, speak to me! Don't somebody want to talk to me? Voice: Sure, we talk. Uh, wh-wh-who are you? Voice: Me big chief standing pine. Uh, wh-wh-where are you standing, pine? Standing pine: Right beside you, paleface. Well, h-h-have you got a message for me? Standing pine: Look in crystal ball. What you see? Nothing. Standing pine: Look some more! You see now? Big vein of gold in ground. Heap plenty gold. Do you see? Y-Yes, I think I do. Standing pine: You go get heap big fortune in gold. Big nuggets. Uh, where? Thirteen paces due east from Cortez rock, on south side, stone mountain. You dig, dig, dig, dig, dig... Hey, hey, wait a minute. Uh, tell me more, standing pine! Uh...oh. Thirteen paces other side of Cortez rock. Thirteen paces... There's Cortez rock. The Indian spirit ain't never fooled me yet. Now, let me see. Thirteen paces east. Yeah, that's east. One, two, three, four, six.. No...five, five. Seven, eight, nine, ten, e--ten, e-eleven, one dozen, thirteen. ( Rocks clanking ) ( Laughs ) Good old standing pine! You told me right this time. Gold! Gold! ( Laughs ) Man: Reach for the sky! ( Pans clatter ) Why, you bandy-legged little scarecrow! What are you doing trespassing on my claim? Oh, I ain't trespassing, mister. I'm just... Viewing the view. You know, I oughtta fill you so full of bullets, they could work you for a lead mine. I'm sorry. I ain't doin' nothin'. My Indian guide told me to come up here. Where is that redskin? I'll pump him full of holes, too. You couldn't. He's already in the happy hunting ground. Hey, are you trying to make a fool out of me? No! It's the truth! He's my psychic spirit. He tells me a lot of things about the future and such. Hey, wait a minute. Ain't you fuzzy q. Jones from showdown flats? The fella that tells all the other people what's gonna happen before it does? Yep, that's me, the great Jones. Heh heh. Shake hands, chum. I'm nord finner. Glad to shake the hand of a great man like you. Say fuzzy, maybe that Indian pal of yours could tell me where I could dig up a little gold dust on this claim. Oh, uh...Ain't you found nothin' yet? Not enough to fill a gnat's tooth. Well, that's too bad. Uh... Um, standing pine-- that's my guide, he didn't say nothin' about there being any gold on this here mountain. Oh, he didn't, huh? Well, I might as well give up working this claim. 'Cause if you say there ain't gold, there ain't, because you sure know what you're talkin' about. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, say, I kinda like this view from up here. Uh, how much will you take for this property? Oh, let me see. I'm sort of a sentimental cuss. I've put a lot of sweat into this claim, and I kinda like the view myself. But, uh... Well, if you'll fork over a 50-- $50? Sold, Mr. Phillip! The price is $50,000. Hey, are you crazy? Yeah, just so crazy that I think you know something that I don't. Now, that's the price! Pay it or get off of my property. Well, now, couldn't we talk this over? Yeah, for 50,000. Now get goin', and don't come back until you can put the money on the barrel head. But, uh-- listen! I ain't killed a guy in over a week, and I wouldn't trust you with myself if I was you. Now get outta here! All right, all right. But just try to overcharge me for this big ol' piece of nothin' around here, you'll probably break your arm, that's what you'll do. Get goin'! ( Gunshots ) Ha ha! Ha ha! And sure enough, just as fuzzy said, I shipped my cattle to Carson city and I got $4.00 more a head. The man's uncanny, I tell ya! That ain't nothin'. The man told me I'd strike it rich just by stakin' a claim in ulder gulch. And I'll wager it'll pay off. Like the United States mint. There comes Mr. Jones now. ( Everyone greeting loudly ) Aw, thanks, fellas. You're all so nice to me. Not at all. You deserve it. You're the biggest man in these parts. Yessiree! Uh, Mr. Jones? When would be a good time to sow my crops? Oh, about the first. First of what? First chance you get. ( Everyone laughs ) Think I'll be gettin' hitched this year, fuzz? Oh, i--i never mess in domestic affairs. It ain't safe. ( Everyone laughs ) Now, listen, fuzz. You put Ralph Emery onto a pretty fine goldmine. How about letting the rest of US in on something good? All: Yeah. Wait a minute, fellas, I was goin' to... Nope, that ain't no good. What ain't no good? Tell US anyway. Well, this is too big. Even for me to handle. I just don't know how to do it. You mean you can't figure things out with that wonderful brain of yours? This is different. How'd you figure out these other things? Uh, that's my secret. Well, I ain't gettin' nosy, but why don't you figure this big deal out the same way? Say, maybe you got somethin' there. Maybe you have. Maybe you have. I was just suggestin', that's all. Well, I gotta go. I got work to do. Just a minute. How 'bout buying you a little drink? No, I'm in a hurry. ( All talk at once ) Take care of yourself. You better start ridin' now. Calling standing pine. Calling standing pine. Come in, standing pine. Standing pine: Standing pine speaks. Fine. Say, everything was just like you said. There's plenty of gold, but there's another feller owns it. Standing pine: Everything okay. You buy from feller, me tell how. Gee whillikers. You will? You listen careful. You got plenty friends. They help buy stone mountain. They give money to you, you give all friends chance to make money. Everybody get rich, plenty rich. Savvy? Yeah, yeah, me savvy. That's a swell idea! Listen more. You don't tell no one where is gold until you get deed. Oh, no, standing pine. That's a secret of ours. Standing pine: You plenty smart fella. I know, standing pine, but this is such a big proposition, I'm gonna send for my pal. He's got brains. He'll help me swing the deal. 'Course, I won't tell him anything about the claim until everything is Jake. Who is friend? Fuzzy: Uh, Billy Carson. Billy Carson? Him no friend, him bad medicine. Don't trust nobody. Yeah, but I can't do it alone. I'm gonna send for him anyhow. You send, maybe he never get here. Oh, yes, he will. He knows how to take care of himself. Okay, okay. Trance all over. Standing pine. Hey, hey, standing pine? Hey. I got a couple more things I wanna tell ya. I wonder if he belongs to the union. How'd you make out? All right, but that stupid runt wants to send for Billy Carson. Billy Carson? That guy run US out of dodge city. Yeah, I know. Well, what'd you tell him? I had to say "okay," but I sorta warned him his pal might not get here. Emery, you're a regular prophet yourself. Pull up a chair. ( Laughs ) Give me three cards. You see, boys, it works like this-- give it a little yank, and it breaks his neck. Looks like an accident, but we're in the clear. And if he should bounce, he wouldn't have a chance to reach his hardware until it was too late. Well, we better hurry. According to where we last saw him, he should be through sawtooth pass by now. Yeah. Cover it up. Put a little sagebrush over it. Oh, don't worry about it. He won't see nothin'. Boys, this is it. Get ready. Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. What's the matter? Settle down. What's the matter with you? Whoa! ( Gunshots ) He sure is a slippery bird. What do you intend to do about it? Well, he may have outsmarted US this time, but I'll get him yet. You better hurry and do it fast, nord. I don't like the looks of this. Come on. ( Men talking ) I gotta get my money. Oh, here he is now. Well, I'm sorry, boys, but I'm just closing up. Now, see here, Mr. Wilson, three days ago I asked you for a loan on my spread. How come I ain't got any action? It takes time to arrange things like this. You know, drawing up papers and such. I can't be fussin' around waiting for that. I wanna get in on fuzzy Jones' proposition. Me, too. So do I. Now, just a minute, gentlemen, I'm going to try and accommodate all of you, but it's going to take a little time. Fuzzy ain't gonna wait while we dawdle around. Pardon me, boys. Mr. Wilson, here's the deed on that 160 acres of mine. I'd like to borrow about $10,000 on it. I'll give you my personal note, as well. Well, I think this could be worked out, Mr. Reed, but it'll take a little time. ( Men talk loudly ) Uh, by the way, Mr. Reed, are you going into this proposition of fuzzy's? You're darn right I am. Well, now, i-- if I were you, I'd investigate this a little further. I wouldn't rush into this blindly. Now, see here, you're a banker, and naturally a cautious man. Fuzzy Jones is a lucky man. I'm taking his advice. Man: Me, too. He's psychic. Man: He knows what's gonna happen before it happens. I'd hate to sit in a poker game with him. He'd know every card before it's dealt. ( All laugh ) He sure would. Fuzzy told me he made a strike that's the granddaddy of all gold strikes. If he needs any backin', I'm climbin' on his wagon. Hey, here comes fuzzy now. ( All shout greetings ) Look out! Hey! Take care of yourself there. Aw, shucks. Ain't nothin' gonna happen to me. If there was, wouldn't I know it? That's right, fuzzy. You can see the future. ( Chattering continues ) Say, don't forget to save me a piece of that proposition, will ya? Till I get my cash? ( Crowd agreeing ) Hey, whoa, wait a minute, boys. Don't crowd me. I'm forming a big organization, and you're all welcome as soon as things get right. ( Men talk at once ) Yeah, and when it is, we'll be on hand to pick the plum. Providing that Billy Carson don't upset the apple cart. Don't worry, he won't. ( Men talk at once ) Listen, listen! I gotta pick up some grub and get back to my diggings. Why don't you fellas leave me alone for a while? ( All talk at once ) Ahem. Ahem. Mr. Jones? Oh, hello, Tom. Say, you better start building a bigger bank. This little thing ain't gonna hold all the gold I'm gonna dig up. To be sure, to be sure. But, confidentially, I could save you a lot of trouble. That is, I, uh, I could let you have the whole 50,000. Uh, you mean that I should shut out all my friends? Then you and I could split even. Nothin' doin'. There's plenty of room for everybody, and I ain't playin' no favorites. Just as you say, but remember-- a banker likes to make money, too. Yeah. Hey, fuzz! Billy! Gosh, am I glad to see you! Glad to be here. Almost didn't make it. Well, come on in. I got plenty to tell ya. Well, fuzz, what are you so all fired in a hurry to see me? You in trouble again? Me? No. I'm in the blue chips this time. Proper. You and me is practically millionaires. Yeah, what'd you do, make a strike of fool's gold? Ha! I'll show you something that'll make your mouth water. Look at that. See if you call it fool's gold. That's the real McCoy, fuzz. Where'd you get it? I can't tell you that. But, uh, where it came from, there's a heap of it big enough to build a state with it. That's interesting, fuzz. Now, how do I fit into the picture? Well, I find this claim, but the fella who owns it-- so, it's not yours, then? Uh, not yet, but it's gonna be. See, he don't know there's gold all over the place. Blind, huh? Oh, of course not. He just don't know what I know. So I'm gonna buy it for $50,000. $50,000? And he doesn't know what he has? Ha. Don't make me laugh, fuzzy. Oh, he's just sentimental. Besides that, he's a nut. Well, you can include me out. I haven't got $50,000 to be buying goldmines from crazy people. You don't have to have. All you gotta do is help me organize the fuzzy q. Jones company, and you're in. I'm in? And where you gonna get your money? Everybody in showdown flats is willing to back me, including Tom Wilson at the bank. Have they seen the property? Not a one, but they just believe in me. Believe in you? Why? Uh, to tell you the truth, I-I hate to admit it, Billy-- of course, you know I'm modest-- but all of a sudden, I suddenly became psychic. You know, that's when you can see into the future. Tell me about this-- this gift of yours, fuzzy. Go ahead. Well... About a month ago, this thing sneaks up on me. I begin to hear voices. Hear voices? Where? In the air, in my head, everywhere. Standing pine told me where I can find this big claim. "Standing pine"? Who's "standing pine"? He's my Indian guide. He-he's a spirit. Spirit?! Fuzz, you better keep that cork in the bottle. Those spirits are gonna get you into trouble. Oh, you old hypocrite! I can't help it if I'm the seventh son of the seventh son of the seventh son. That's a lot of sevenths, fuzz. I should've known better than to send for you. Now, now, keep your shirt on. I'm gonna get you out of this mess. I ain't in no mess! Whether you are or not, tell me the whole story or I'm gonna walk right out of here. I can't. I promised. Promised who? Standing pine. So you're not gonna tell me, huh? Positively no. Well, I'm gonna go, fuzz. When that lynching party gets ready to singe those whiskers, you can call for me. Aw, gosh. Oh, well. They laughed at Columbus, too. Nobody laugh at you. You plenty smart fellow. Go get money quick, but don't tell nothing to Billy Carson. He gum things up bad for you. You doggone right I won't tell him, standing pine, and thanks for the tip. Hey, Billy! Billy Carson! Billy, you old rascal, how are ya? Tip-top, Mr. Reed. I'm glad to see you again. What are you doing in showdown flats? Oh, just sorta nosin' around. Oh, Billy, this is kitty. You remember her, don't ya? Kitty? Why, sure! Miss Reed, last time I saw you, you were knee-high to a prairie dog. Billy used to ramrod the old circle "g" for me. I've heard dad speak a lot about you. Yeah? Good or bad? Well, your ears didn't burn. Ah, just think. I used to bounce you on my knee. Hold still a while, will you, Billy? I gotta pick up some shotgun shells. Coyotes gettin' pretty bad lately. There are always coyotes to smoke out, Mr. Reed. Yeah. I'll be right back. Your dad sure looks fine. Been doing pretty well for himself? Yes, with the ranching business, but... Something bothering you? Well...yes and no. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but... But what? Well, dad's trying to mortgage part of the acreage. Does he... Does he need the money? No. That doesn't make sense. I know it doesn't, but dad won't listen to anybody except a man named fuzzy q. Jones. Fuzzy Jones? Oh, now I understand. The goldmine in the sky. You don't mean to tell me he's gonna invest in that? He's not the only one. Everyone in town seems to be walking around with their eyes closed. There's something wrong. I just know it. I think that way myself, but I can't-- I can't figure it out. The whole trouble is fuzzy has foretold and predicted some very wonderful things. He told Luke mcgovern where to find a pocket of gold. He even told dad to ship his cattle to dodge city for a better price. Well, that could've been a coincidence. Got to get back to the spread, Billy. Ride out for supper some time. Welcome anytime. Maybe I'll do that, Mr. Reed. I could help you hunt down some of those coyotes. Sure. Glad to have you. Bye. Bye. Hey, Billy. Wait a minute. I wanna talk to ya. What about? I'm busy. Oh, I been figurin' things out, and we been pals too long to fight over anything. Aw, that's great, fuzzy. I knew you weren't as stupid as you pretended. Now, tell me all about this mining property. Where is it? Tell me all about it. I hadn't ought to, but, uh-- standing pine: You plenty smart. Go get money quick, but don't tell Billy Carson. He gum things up bad for you. Nope. I can't do it, Billy. You just gotta have faith in me, like everybody else. Oh, fuzzy, are you absolutely loco? No, I, uh-- hey, wait a minute. I'm psychic. I-i-I'll prove it to you. Uh, hey, mister, come here. Now, I predicted this. I didn't mean to, honest, but I did. I told you you was gonna break your arm, didn't I? Well, tell him about it. Yes, you did, you little squirt, and the next time you start fooling around with my future, I'm gonna take-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, but I can't help it. Haven't I seen you someplace before? I don't think so. I'm from Texas myself. Uh, tell me, stranger, is this all he says it is? Well, sure it is. Here's the proof. I broke my arm once myself. Pain you very much? Sure. It's pretty sore. Hurts like the dickens. Now, I, uh... I don't usually carry my sling so low. I carry it up a little higher. You see, it makes it-- you didn't break your arm. You're just fooling. Gosh, I never knew a fella with a busted arm could fight like that. Get smart, fuzz. His arm's not broken. I sprained it pretty bad, didn't I? Why'd you pretend it was busted? Because fuzzy predicted it? Well, he said I was gonna break my arm, and I sprained it. That's close enough, isn't it? You see there, Billy? I'm right. Fuzz, I'd like to talk to you alone. Nothin' doin'. I ain't answerin' no questions. All right, suit yourself. Hey, uh, Mr. Finner? I hope you ain't mad at me. No, I ain't mad at you... But I'll get him. Uh, then you will sell me your claim? Sure, if you get the $50,000, and soon. Well, mister, I'm gonna predict that you get $50,000 all of a sudden. That's just the kind of a prediction I like, pal. Hello, miss kitty. Ha! You got yourself loaded down. Let me help you. Been shopping? Quite. Actually, I'm waiting for dad. He's finishing his business with Mr. Wilson. Oh, you mean about getting his loan. Yes, and i'm so terribly worried. I know he's gonna turn it over to fuzzy Jones. I better have a talk to him. I wish you would. Oh, here he comes now. He's awful ornery, though. Howdy, Billy. Hiya, Mr. Reed. I--i hope you don't mind my butting in, but I don't think I'd turn any money over to fuzzy. Why? I don't know for sure, but I have an idea somebody's dealing from the bottom of the deck. Yeah? What proof you got? I don't know. I saw nord finner talking to a couple of hoodlums I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw my horse. What's nord finner got to do with it? Well, maybe nothing, but he was pretending he had a broken arm to make fuzzy's predictions look good. You mean to say he didn't really break his arm? Nah, not at all. He was faking. Huh. That's something to think about. Think I'll drive out and see fuzzy this afternoon. Fine. Bye, Mr. Reed. Bye. Bye, kitty. Bye, Billy. Giddyap. Look. Wait a minute. You stay here. Fuzzy: Standing pine? Have you a message for me today? Answer me, standing pine. I am here. Today is your lucky day. You collect all money from people. Give to man from mountain of gold. Hurry up everything. Hold it, you. Now, you keep quiet, turn around, and start walking. What's the meaning of this? You found out a little too much. Now get on your horse and head for town. Get moving. He gets to showdown flats ahead of US, he'll blow everything right up in our face. Who says he's gonna get to showdown flats? You know what to do. Yeah. Get! ( Gunshot ) All right, up on your feet. Hey, what's the big idea? Dayton, why'd you kill Reed? I don't know what you mean. You know what I mean. And you might tell me what this game is with fuzzy Jones. I never heard of him. You better start hearing right now. All right, take it easy. I'll talk. Better make it straight. Talk fast. We rigged up a little trick in fuzzy's storeroom to make him think he was psychic. What does Emery and finner got to do with it? I ain't sayin'. Well, I'll find out myself. Come on. You ain't takin' me in for no killin'. No, not yet. Come on. You see, Joe, I just wanna make sure you don't share our secret with anybody. I'll be back later for you. You won't get away with this. No? You're here, aren't you? Say, partner, you wouldn't know where Mr. Wilson was at, would you? I sure would. You wanna know? Yeah. Yeah, if you don't mind. Tom Wilson's where I'd be now if I wasn't broke. Where's that? Wherever everybody else is that's got cash money. At fuzzy Jones'? That's right. They're fixin' the deal right now, I reckon. Much obliged. Sure. Man: One, two, three thousand. That's right, Mr. Black. Here you are, 4,800, Mr. Jones. Let's see now, fuzzy, that's exactly 40,000. Henry Reed ain't shown up, yet. I got him down for 10,000. If he wants to pull out, I'll take his share. I'll remember that, Mr. Wilson. ( Men talking at once ) Well, fellas, as soon as everything is signed and sealed, you'll really see something. That's right, fuzzy! ( Men talk at once ) All right, do your stuff. Why don't we just take it from him? Shut up. He'll take the rap, not US. Paleface. This is standing pine. You know what to do with cash? Gee whillikers, chief, uh... Uh, how did you know I got the money so soon? Me see all, know all. You be smart. You do what I say. Oh, sure, sure. I'll do just as you said. Trance all over. That is all. I'll meet you at the horses. Right. ( Knock on door ) Uh, come in. Oh, it's you. I didn't expect you so soon. Well, I didn't expect to come here, either, but something told me I should. Uh, was it a voice? Why, yes, I guess it was. Did he say anything else? Well, no. No, nothing. Well, that's good. Huh? I mean, uh, how are ya? I'm in a mighty fine mood to sell my property. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't go through with it. I thought you were Henry Reed. What do you mean? Well, uh, you said 50,000, and I've only got 40. Now listen, partner, I'm gonna do the right thing by ya. I'll take the 40,000, and we'll call it a deal. You--you mean it? You give me the money, and I'll give you the deed. It's all right here. I'll count it for you. Never mind. I trust you. Here's your deed, all sealed and signed. Gee, whiz. Thanks, mister. So long, partner. I'll be seeing ya. Hey, uh, standing pine? Standing pine! Everything worked out just like you said. From now on, the fuzzy q. Jones company owns stone mountain. Hey, how's this look to ya? It's in the bag. All right, let's get out of here. Hey, look! Who's that? It looks like the sheriff to me. Well, come on! Howdy, fuzzy. Well, sheriff, can't make any predictions today. Think fast, fuzzy. This is my savings, and I wanna get in on your proposition. Sheriff! Sheriff! What was that? I didn't hear nothin'. Sheriff! In here! There it is again. I still don't hear it. Say, one of US is crazy. Heh heh. Must be you, sheriff. In the storeroom! Sheriff: What happened? Who tied you up? One of fuzzy's spirits. Oh, they couldn't have done it. No? Look up there. That's how they worked it. One of the gang disguised their voice, and you fell for it. Holy cow. That's it. Was I stupid! Now are you convinced you've been bamboozled? You mean the gold deal was a fake? Why, certainly. But I got the deed. It's not worth the paper it's written on. No? Hey, that fella's got all our money--$40,000! It's gonna be tough for you unless you make good. How long's he been gone? Only a few minutes. What are we waiting for? I gotta get that money or they'll string my neck! I hope when they find that Billy Carson, he's starved to death. You sure tied him up for keeps, nord. I'm sort of worried about Joe Dayton. Now, look, we don't meet up with him, we'll split the money. No one seems to be trailing US. Guess we can take it easy from now on. Sure. We'll be across the state line in no time now. Hey, look! Ain't that Joe Dayton's horse? Yeah. I don't like the looks of this. Come on. Looks like he left in a hurry. It sure does. Hey, there! Sounds like Joe! Yeah... go ahead and answer him. Hey, Joe! Where are ya? Yeah, over here! Come on, get me out of this. I'm glad you fellas showed up. I was beginning to give up hope. How'd you get in this jam? Billy Carson grabbed me after I knocked off Reed. Said he'd be back after me later. Well, he won't be back. We took care of him and got the money, too. Just the same, I'd feel better if we had more miles between US. Let's go! They haven't been gone long, I can tell you that. They're probably headed through sawtooth canyon. Fuzzy: Maybe we can head 'em off. I know a shortcut. ( Gunshots ) ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshots continue ) ( Gunshots continue ) Ralph. Ralph! You hold 'em off while I get away. I'll meet you at the shack. All right, go on ahead. ( Gunshots continue ) Hey... So you tried to outsmart fuzzy q. Jones, huh? Sellin' a lot of worthless property. What are you talking about? It was all done according to law. You got a deed, I got the money. Now get up! I think there's a lot of townspeople that wanna talk to you. Now get on that horse of yours. You better give up, Emery. Come out with your hands up. You want me, come and get me! Keep him busy, sheriff. Pull up. Unload. Get over there. Nice work, fuzzy. Fuzzy q. Jones always gets his man. Sheriff, better pick Dayton up. All right, Emery. You two, on your horses. That's fuzzy, all right. Looks like they got some prisoners. There's been trouble of some kind. Maybe they tried to hijack our gold. Sheriff: Lock 'em up, Charlie. All: What happened? ( Men talking at once ) Well, wait a minute, boys. Everything is all right. That's right, we knew we could trust you. Now, when can we see the property? Well, uh, i-i.. Oh, shucks. You tell 'em, Billy. Well, gentlemen, you and fuzzy are victims of a swindle. There isn't any gold in stone mountain. ( All shouting at once ) Now, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Don't get excited! Fuzzy said everything was all right, and it is. Here's your money-- every cent of it. Man: What about the fortune we're supposed to make? Man #2: What about our profit? Just a minute, gentlemen. You oughtta be glad to get your money back. Put it in my bank, and it'll always be safe. Man: That's right. We didn't lose nothin' anyway. I think we owe fuzzy a vote of thanks. ( Crowd murmurs ) Billy: I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wilson. Sheriff, what do you propose to do with this hombre here? He started all this trouble. Turn him loose. He's a friend of yours, ain't he? I never saw him before this mess in my life. Hey, now, Billy! You--you can't pull that on me. That's the truth, sheriff. Well, I guess I'll turn him loose anyway. Isn't there a law in this state against, uh... Fortune-telling? Come to think of it, there is. Uh, that'll get you about 30 days. Oh, holy cow! Y-You... You can't do this to me! Pardon me, gentlemen. Where can I find Mr. Wilson? I'm Mr. Wilson. My name is Graham. I represent the railroad company. Our engineers have made a survey, and I'm here to arrange for a roadbed ballast. To make it brief, I'd like to purchase stone mountain from whoever owns it, and I'm willing to go as high as 150,000 bucks. ( Yells ) I'm psychic! I'm psychic! Ah!!! Uh, hey, fuzzy! Fuzzy, where you going? To have another peek in that crystal ball! ( Everyone laughs )
