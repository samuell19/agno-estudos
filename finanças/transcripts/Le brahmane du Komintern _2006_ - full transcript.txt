I attend the changing of the guard at the Kremlin, and I am surprised at this sentry guard, who photographs his collegues for souvenirs. Both actor and spectator, of a ritual, whose solemnity he spoils, as he tries to capture it... "THE COMINTERN BRAHMIN" PART 1 : MEXICO, RUSSIA In Moscow's autumn gusts, I also seek my place, in pursuit of a ghost. Narendranath Bhatthacharya, alias Manabendra Nath Roy, alias M. N. Roy, who become in the Twenties here, in Moscow, a leader of the Communist International, or Comintern, as the Russian named it, always fond of acronyms. A year before, it was in Mexico, I started to follow his tracks: Mexico, where M. N. Roy disembarked in June 1917, where fighting rumbled on, between the troops of Zapata and Pancho Villa. The last thrones of a peasant revolution, pompously commemorated by the monument in the centre of the Republic Square "Plaza de la Republica", which that Sturday became... The rock 'n' roll square! From 3 to 5 o'clock in the evening! I first came across the name 'Adolfo Gilly' in the correspondence of sub-commandant Marcos. Then I read his works on the insurgent Mexico of 1910-1920. before discovering, that he was an important Latin-American left-wing activist of the 60's and 70's. In short, an ideal guide, at the crossroads of the revolutionary dreams, of yesterday and today. But our discussion takes alternative paths: the missile crisis in 1962, that Adolfo Gilly lived through in Cuba, early century American and Mexican anarcho-syndicalism, Bolivarism, Zapatism... And M. N. Roy in all of that? On Roy we've already said it all? We said everything. You missed it. That's it, you had to be there. You had to be there, dear filming machine and you weren't there. It was very interesting. It's past. Roy was a nationalist, an Indian of the high Brahmin caste, who became... who was what is today called a terroist, but who was in fact an insurrectional nationalist. He came to the USA to buy weapons, for the anti-colonialist struggle in India. That was in 1916. He came to California. And there he had the first revelation: that is, he discovered Western philosophy in California. In Standford, of all places! There, he not only learned Western philosophy, but he had a second revelation, he met Evelyn Trent. It seems there was an elective affinity. "radiacl militant" I think he became acquainted over there with the anarcho-syndicalist ambiance. I think so, because it was Vladimir Leon who suggested it to me... This interview is horribly rigged, it has to be said! ...who suggested me to think what I just said in front of the camera. And yet, I hadn't invented M. N. Roy. I remember this photo that Hari Vasudevan had show me, a historian from Culcutta met in Paris, where I was astounded to discover, beside Lenin, Gorky, Bukharin, Zinoviev, the tall silhouette, totally unknown, of an Indian: M. N. Roy... Who was he? How had he gotten there? What was his role? And why did nobody today seem to remember him? I chose to stay at the hotel: "La Habana", in Cuba Street, subway stop: Salvador Allende. As if by summoning up some other revolutionary ghosts, I would have more chance of coming across that of M. N. Roy. Nothing is less certain. More than 80 years have passed since his arrival in Mexico. The eyewitnesses have disappeared. History had past its gloss over. Hello... I'd like to speak to Paco Ignacio Taibo. I'm Vladimir Leon. Thank you. Adolfo Gilly had given me a lead. Paco Ignancio Taibo II known as "PIT dos", author of successful political detective novels, a charismatic figure of the Mexican left, may be able to help me. In the car of my precious cicerone, Ignancio Saldivar, I try to pick up the thread again So M. N. Roy fails in love with Evelyn, a young American radical. He flees the USA where the police track him down, and he finds himself in Mexico What does he live on? German money. The Kaiser's secret services support this anti-British activist. He owes his false identity to them, Charles Martin, a seminarians from Pondichery: So we drive towards PIT 2's house. I'm sure to find a reliable ally in him, to obstinately uncover the forgotten histories. of the years 1845-1847, There is no good history of the Texas war. When you want to read one, there's only General Filisola's text! A soldier's version, written 150 year ago. Under the eye of the Zapatist sub-commandant Marcos and accompanied by the dog Gurtis, PIT 2 takes from his library, a work he wrote 20 years ago, one of the few that assigns such importance to M. N. Roy's visit to Mexico. But even this book seems like a mirage. First National Congress of the Mexican Socialist Part that opens on 25 August 1919 and where about 30 delegates met, supporting almost as many tendecies. Among them is M. N. Roy, who abandoned a last attempt to transfer Chinese arms for an Anti-British insurrection in India, and his wife Evelyn, now members of the small Party. Roy reveals in his "Memoirs" his romantic and enthuasiastic version of this first socialist demonstration in the Zocalo, Mexico's central square. "Behind a huge picture of Lenin "held high in front, there was a forest of red flags and festoons "on the later were striking: 'Down with Yankee imperialism!' 'Petroleum belongs to the Mexican people!' Long live the Revolutionary Alliance of Latin-American Republics! 'Long live the Bolsheviks!' 'Long live the Soviet Republic of Mexico!' "At the conference that followed, the proletarian delegates, "and bourgeois guests, all alike, "listened with rapt attention "to the message from the Great October Revolution, "from petrograd, "composed by John Reed in New York, "and applauded vigorously, when the chairman "finished reading the spurious document by raising the slogans: 'Lond live the Great October Revolution! Long live Comrade Lenin!' "A new god and new religion "demanded the devotion of the revolutionary proletariant. "I joined the ranks of the faithful in quest of the utopia." And Roy definitely didn't delay in joining these faithful. In a Chinese coffee shop in the town centre, "El Chino" a small cosmopolitan group met up in order to found what he callls nothing less than "the first Communist Party outside of Rusia". PIT 2 draws the supposed location of the coffee shop "El Chino" that l'll never find. Just as I'm disappointed, in the posh area of Colonia Roma on the Merida Avenue by not finding number 48, Roy's house. The number going suddenly from 36 to 50A. At the other address I have for M. N. Roy, 33 Cordoba Street. to the left is No. 30, to the right is No. 35, A local resident I asked, replies laughing: It's a ghost house. I roam the Colonia Roma area looking for a sign of this past. I end up getting completely lost, and find myself in a small, shaded square, bearing Puskin's name. There is a bust of the poet, that immediately reminds me of his famous statue in Moscow's centre, Puskin square, two steps from the Lux hotel, home to the Comintern delegates Mikhal Borodin, his true name Mikhail Gruzenberg, alias the Englishman, alias the Banker alias Iakov, alias Mr. Brown disembarks in Mexico in the summer of 1919. He arrives from the U.S.A where he had tried to sell Russian Imperial jewels on behalf of the young Soviets. He meets M. N. Roy. The two get along. Borodin moves into the beautiful house of the "companero indio", "the Indian comrade", as they called him here. Borodin is an old Bolshevik a professional revolutionary. In the course of the late, heated discussions. he ends up converting M. N. Roy, sweeping away his last nationalist convictions. Roy writes in his "Memoirs": "Borodin introduced me to the intricacies of Hegelian dialectics "as the key to Marxism. "My lingering faith in the special genius of India faded "as I learned from him the history of European culture. "It was no easier for a born heretic "to accept a new faith, albeit materialist and atheistic, "than to pass through the eye of a needle. "It was my last resistance to Marxism." -I used to speak Russian a long time ago. -In Moscow? Yes. But here I cannot practice. I'm a member of the PRD. I was a member of the National Council of the PRD. I was twice deputy... Well, it's a long story! And I feel a Comintern spirit on discovering that I can speak Russian with Gerardo Unzueta former leader of the Mexico Communist Party, today leader in the Party of Democratic Revolution, PRD, who receives me at the Centre of Studies of the Worker and Social Movement. We are soon met by Comrade Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo another historic figure of the CP and by my friend Ignacio Saldivar who performs, with all the necessary seriousness the introduction to our meeting. Today we have the opportunity, on this Wednesday 13... Yes ...13 November, to meet one of the great leaders of Mexican communism, Gerardo Unzueta. And he will now provide us with information about this Indian personality, Roy, in our country. This will be the first question. Good. I think that the response to this first question can only be very unsatisfactory. And for one reason: that we have very little information about Roy's stay in Mexico. Roy went, as delegate of the Mexican Communist Party to the 2nd Congress of the Communist International. And there, on the very day of his arrival, the opening day of the congress. he stopped being the delegate of the Mexican Communist Party and become the delegate of British india, of the Communist Party of British India. Which means he stopped being the Mexican Party delegate. That's why I say he was a turncoat. Excuse me. No, no please. I haven't much more to add. Just a few little things. Roy published in Mexico, while he was still here, a book that's very hard to find but perhaps in a library you may find it. He arrived in Mexico in 1917. From there he left for Moscow in December 1919. From that moment, I don't know how long he worked in the International team but I understand that he spent several years in Moscow. And so, in the archives in Moscow you can find the meterial. Not just because over there they've preserved everything better... Nothing has been preserved here! The archives have disappeared, because they were lost, or taken by police... Not even the acts of the National Congress are here anymore. Not even the acts! No more acts of Congress and no more trace of M. N. Roy nor his American friends, these "slackers" as they were nickname: left-wing militants who fled wartime United State. Among them, Charles Philips, a 25 year old pacifist, with whom Roy collaborated in various socialist publications and who would be in Petrograd the following year. On the famous photo, he has a small moustache and white shirt behind Zinoviev, to Roy's right But for now, Charles Phillips and the other "slackers", writers, poets, designers, revolutionary apprentices, haunt the town's streets and bars forming this "small cosmopolitan community of free men" in M. N. Roy's word who loved to take them to Sanborn's a chic drudstore on Madero Avenue whose coffee he particularly liked. The drugstore is still there. they still serve coffee, cocoa and pastries but I doubt you'll come across many Marxist conspirators now. No doubt these debauched Yankees who were to introduce Roy to the taste of wine and join his small communist party bore little resemblance to the image of a rebel peasant in a straw hat for anyone this country to really want to remember them. Daniela Spensers historian of Mexican politics, met thanks to Adolfo Gilly, suspects Roy of having exaggerate his role in Mexico, It's probable. She doubts his friendship with the President of that time, Venustiano Carranza. And I want to believe it because Roy, in his "Memoir" is so careful to justify the paradox. He writes: "Concretely, I felt that an aristocrat "intellectually emancipated from the prejudices of his class "could make a more disinterested and enthusiastic social revolutionary "than the most passionately class-conscious proletarian." This peculiar aristocratic Marxism of M. N. Roy that he forges here in Mexico under the influence of his rebelious "slacker" friends, the local anarcho-syndicalism, the more or less enlightened bourgeoise, with whom he courts shamelessly. And of course, Mikhail Borodin, the man from Moscow. At the end of 1919, the latter suggests that Roy Evelyn and Charlie Philips Join him in Soviet Russia as delegates at the 2nd Congress of the comintern. An Indian and 2 Americans co-opted by a Russian Jew to represent the Mexican working class. The International on the march! And I have trouble imagining such nonchalance such political freedom when, wandering in the peaceful Coyoacan district an otherside of ferocious Soviet past suddenly appears. Here Frieda Kahlo had her blue house and some streets from here her intimate comrade, Leon Trotsky, lived in that fortress-villa, protected by a watchtower, built after a first failed assassination attempt on the founder of the 4th international in May 1940. But Stalin wanted to achieve his aims: destroy his personal enemy and the last great figure of October 1917. inside the house, everything seems to have been left as it was on that 20 August 1940, when Romon Mercader, a GPU agent, was introduced to Trotsky and struck him a mortal blow to the head with a ice pick. in the archives of the Communist International in Moscow I will come across this cardboard file, labelled "L. D.. Trotzki" with applique writing, enclosing his letters from exile. The Soviet terror was also bureaucratic. They liquidated men, but preserved their writings, carefully indexing them. "Roy is a national democrat who has led messy policy in China "and who up to now has still not understood it" Here, Trotsky writes in French: "In Russia we have the right-wing who, regarding colonial revolution "are in solidarity with Roy and Brandler and not with us. "What's more, Roy led Stalin's policy in China "that I fought with all my forces. My best wishes, Leon Trotsky." And it's a letter date-stamped in Constantinople. Moscow Shakespearean capital of intrigues, of swings of alliance, of assassins and irony tyranny where Roy in 1927 will be one of those voting for Trotsky's exclusion from the Comintern's Executive Committee despite his admiration for the Red Army's leader. And Moscow of 1920, where Evely and Roy arrive joining Charlie Philips in preparing for the 2nd Congress of the Internation in a country ravaged by civil war but still vibrating with the enthusiasm for the building of a new world. And Moscow of 2004, that I come to in search of this past, staying in Tverskaya Street, the central artery of the town where the Roys and Philips stayed, at the Lux Hotel. The street is today lined with chic shops and obstructed by four-door saloons with tinted windows and gaint 4*4 cars, driven with the same arrogance as in the past the black limousines of the apparatchiks. The central telegraph at the bottom of the street just beside the Kremilin becomes my headquarters. And not really knowing where to look for M. N. Roy here, I call all over. Yes, M. N. Roy! I thought that... well, you're also called Roy because of M. N. Roy. And, as I'm making my film by seeking political relationships that might exist between history and this Indian. I've already been to Mexico and India, now I'm in Moscow. All that might link him to a more contemporary history is interesting. But I can talk to you about it in more detail if we have the chance to meet... And we got the opportunity to meet the next day. historian who become famous in Gorbachev's time for his works on Stalin, explains in great detail, the journey to his house. He's surprised that I don't have a car. So I have to take the suburban train, the "elektrichka", which will take me to the small station of Nemchinovka. It's one of these localities on the outskirts where the Moscovites love to come to their "dachas", small village house, where they disappears as soon as they can, to devote themselves frantically to DIY, home gardening, mushroom-picking or salting cucumbers. in front of Roy Medvedev's house a car is parked from NTV television station come to interview him about the depositiion of Nikita Khrushchev by the Central Committee in 1964, 40 years ago. We wait in the the garden, with Olga Nikolaevna, who reigns over the administration of the Medvedev house. at the moment, they're still working and I feed Rex. Have you done a lot of walking? There's not really much to see here. There's an interesting Georgian restaurant. Over there is a cathedral, have you seen it? A superb cathedral... Baptist. -Baptist? -oh yes, huge! Yes, that surprised me, that non-orthodox cross. It was the Baptists who built that here. It's big, big! Well, that's customary. You know, they have identical buildings all over. There's a service every Saturday. There are lots of dachas that are built. They grow link mushrooms! 4 years ago the house were mainly wooden. Today people are buying them up. Over there, they buy the land and demolish the old house. The areas's not bad, close to Moscow Are they the "New Russians" who are buying here? They're not poor people of course. Roy Alexandrovich who isn't really one of the richest, builds slowly. But it's like Irakli's house that doesn't go so fast. it has to be done progressively. The masonry is done but the roof has to wait. But for those with the means, the house is built in 3 months. I'll go see if Roy Alexandrovich needs me to do anything. In a few sentences, Olga Nikolaevna plunges me into this new Russia where people buy land left, right and centre, and take to revering all possible cults, however unorthodox. And yet, this curious feeling that nothing changes: the birches, the rowan trees and gooseberry bushes, the wooden toilet cabin at the bottom of the garden, the neighbour doing, DIY, the sound of the train in the distance... Did the Revolution take place? Did the Soviet Union crumble? Seen from this little garden, Russia seems forever still. But now the NTV team have finished their interview, we hurry to join Roy Medvedev in his study. When I was born in 1925 everyone knew the name of Roy. He intervened in China at the Chinese Party Congress, he also intervened in the Comintern which, at the time, played a great role in the country. But it was all about customary reports at that time that could be done by a communist who was considering working for India in the service of the Soviet Union and who could go to China to give instructions. It was the psychology of revolutionaries at this time. He would just as likely have gone to France and intervened in the French party. That seemed perfectly normal to them. But I am of course, interested in this figure as I was named in his honour. All communist parents then tended not to give their children Russian names but unusual ones: "Vladen" for Vladimir Lenin, "Mir" which means :the peace"... "May" and "Maya" for 1st of May. There was also "Stalina" and lots of Vladimirs for Lenin. A boy called "Tractor", another "Ikki" the Russian acronym of the Executive Committee of Communist Internantional. "Roy" and "Jaures" were really quite human names! Usually, people thought it was an English or American name. And I, so as not to pass for an Englishman or an American which was important, I said it wasn't an English name, but the name of a famous Indian revolutionary. I said that. But no one knew him. And I could not be more specific. I said he was famous in the middle of the 20's and then he left the political scene. So you have a very communist family? Of course! My father was a communist, he was a political commissioner in the Red Army. He studied and taught at the Military and Political Academy. It was a family of young communists, very staunch, In their circle, It was allowed usually at this time. He was a "red professor", a Party intellectual and commissioner. He died during the Stalinist repressions. That's all I can tell you about Roy. Before leaving him, Roy Medvedev suggests that we meet again in two days time, at the Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament where he is invited to a round table on the eviction of Khrushchev organised by Vladimir Jirinovsky, nationalist and populist politician, conveniently turned unpredictable and extreme opponent, at the time of Boris Yeltsin. When I worry about such a dubious sponsorship, Roy Alexandrovich immedialely corrects me: In your country, France, they demonize Russian politicians and represent them as they've never been. Jirinovsky is, for the Russians a completely normal character, with whom it is interesting to watch the Duma session. You never know in advance what he's going to say. And that's all No one takes him seriously. Neither himself, nor his party. Here, in Rusia, we don't consider him as a politician, but as a curious intriguing character even a little clownish... The atmosphere, however is hardly clownish in the parliamentary offices of the LPDR, Jirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party, whose golden initial are on show everywhere. Under the watch of the plain-clothes guards who, it's not clear, if they're protecting or supervising, this strange commemorative ceremony takes place: a meeting of nostalgic veterans turned spiritualist session with, around the table, the old Communist Party executive, the current Jirinovsky militants but also, Nikita Khrushchev! I'd like to hand over to Nikita Khrushchev to speak, grandson of the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, jounalist I would first like to thank that you have remembered... -Does the microphoine work? -...this date. In fact, I didn't expect to intervene, and I'm not prepared for a serious speech. But I'd like to thank everyone. And...You've nothing to add? Face with the grandson's sullen silence Jirinovsky tries another question. But you're the grandson! We're celebrating your grandfather! You can't only find pleasant. You could observe it from the inside. What did Nikita Sergueievich think about his deposition? As a result of Brezhnev's competition who wanted to be General Secretary? Or did it really concern a charge of course and your grnadfather committed great errors and the country was truly tired? Or was it an international plot? I'm amazed that it was so easy for our small film crew authorized by absolutely no one and having warned only the day before of its arrival, to enter and film so freely inside the Duma. I don't know if it should be seen as a sign of transparent democracy or rather a sign of this Assembly's lack of influence. I'd been surprised by this remark by Roy Medvedev, concerning the role of the deputies in Russia: Deputy, that's not a political activity. I was a deputy for two years in Gorbachev's time, and it's not a political role. It has no power! The delegates and leaders of the Communist International gathered in Moscow in July 1920 for the 2nd Congress, burned with another flame. They weren't more than 35 years old on whole and saw themselves at the avant-garde of a World Revolution that seemed so imminent to them. Charlie Philups wrote: "Roy was the only delegate from the colonies "the only one who can speak with experience and intelligence "from the viewpoint of the struggle in the oppressed countries. "He made a great impression on everyone. Including Lenin" M. N. Roy presents his thesis on the colonial question, that Lenin had personally ordered, and where he asserted contrary to the later, that the communist movement must refuse all collaboration with the nationalist bourgeois movements. "The bourgeois nationalists in no way reflect the aspirations of the masses." He accuses them of defending a local capitalism that would only replace foreign capitalism without changing any of the deprived people's conditions. Roy provokes an outcry when he declares that "The destiny of the revolutionary movement in Europe "depends on the course of the revolution in the East." Lenin restores that comrade Roy is going to far but the latter finally manages to have his thesis adopted together with Lenin's unanimously, less than 3 abstentions. For the first time, a voice from the colonies made itself heard in the concert of European revolutionaries, affirming the autonomy and power of liberation movements from other countries. As for Vladimir Jirinovsky, he at last ends his question to Khrushchev's grandson. But the latter keeps wishing not to remember anything. The microphones are taken away and he doesn't utter a word until the end of the meeting, which closes with a speech by Jirinovsky where history is triumphant and celebratory, but not dialectic And in this country, would they really have believed in historic materialism one day? The fact that our round table takes place in the building with the highest decision-making power must confer it a special significance. The Duma is the highest level of legislative power. There is nothoing above it. This is even the highest floor. Above us there's nothing else. - Molotov was here. - Yes. And this floor, 70 years ago, when the Soviet goverment was based here, was occupied by Kaganovich and Molotov! Before, I was in Molotov's office, but I moved. The whole floor is for the LDPR. We've been here for 11 years. For us, It's become a tradition: in 1997, we commemorated the date related to the 80th anniversary of the burial of our Czar. It was at exactly at the time of the funeral in St. Petersburg. And since then we commemorate all these anniversaries: Leonid Ilitch Brezhnev's death in 1992 and the 40 years of Khrushchev's deposition. There was good in Imperial Russia and in the Soviet Union. And even only good! With some shadows as in anyone's life! That's our country. And we want everyone to be proud of it of the Imperial period, of the Soviet Period likewise the current period. History is a good thing and we live in a marvellous country. History is a good thing and we live in a marvellous country. Action! History is a good thing indeed and allow for all types of nostalgia: that of Jirinovsky, whose eyes light up to occupy Molotov and Kanganovich's officers the bureaucrat and the butcher of the Stalinist terror that of the Russia that only wants to look at its Soviet past fondly, as the huge success of the televised historical sagas testify picturesquely reconstructing the brutal 20's, 30's or 40's. So I too, reconstruct And I resume M. N. Roy's "Memoirs" where he describes his arrival in Petrogrand in the spring of 1920 then his almost immediate departure for Moscow: "I was naturally very anxious "to visit the cradle of the Revolution. "It looked like a haunted place. "The main thoroughfare were practically deserted. "The wooden pavement of the famous Nevsky Prospect 'was torn in many places. "Only two years ago, it was lined with luxury shops and palatial houses. "They were boarded up and closed. "Across the river Neva "stood the spire of the St. Peter and St. Paul Basilica "which had for a century guarded the subterranean dungeons "where hundreds of political prisoners had languished. "The bullet-riddled Winter Palace presented a sombre spectacle. "Before I had seen enourh, "It was time to rush to the station and catch the train for Moscow. "A night's run and I was there. "The vast open space in front of the station "was crowded with men in uniform; "rickety carriages pulled by emaciated horses "Lurched on the cobble stones "at the risk of being smashed by motor cars "which defied all usual traffic regulations." From Three Statations Square, a car took the Roys towards the town. While crossing the Moskova, they passed the imposing cathedral of Christ Saviour, destroyed by Stalin in 1931, to build a gigantic Soviet Palace never finished, and whose foundations were recycled into an open-air swimming pool, before Yeltsin decided to rebuid the identical cathedral in 1994. The mansion were Roy was surprised to be met by Borodin, is still there, beside the river and now houses the British Embassy. In M. N. Roy's words: "The ground-floor was the private residence of Karakhan "the Vice-Commissar of Foreign Affairs. "The upper storey was reserved for distinguished State guests. "Borodin conducted me to a tall window "and pushed aside the thick pink satin curtain. "The Moskwa was flowing in front of the house; "along the other bank there ran a high wall behind which "several huge golden domes glistened in the afternoon sun. "That was the Kremlin." What is Soviet power? What is the essence of this new power that still no one wants to or can understand in most countries? It essence that attracts to it the workers of all countries in always greater numbers, lies in the fact that the state was previously led by rich people and capitalists and now for the first time, the State is led by the very classes that capitalism oppressed! Even in the most democratic, even in the freest of republics while Capital dominates, while the land remains private property, the State will always be led by a small minority, made up of capitalists or rich people. For the first time in world political power is organised here in Russia, so that only the workers, only the peasants, excluding the exploiters, make up the mass organisations, the Soviets, to which all political power is transferred. "What is Soviet Power?: V. I Lenin, recorded in the Kremlin, 1919. Yes, hello... hello. Yes. Excuse me, but I have a French film crew. I speak and they film me. Good, okay. Is it for work? First, there are these containers that are very practical for preservattion. There are the questions of temperature, humidity, but we have very good air-conditioning. Everything is preserved here. And carefully: if something doesn't work, we repair it, we change the dust jackets... in short, we preserve. But everything is recorded. This is the only place guarding all the Comintern's archives. And is access easier today? Up to 19191, access was limited to institutions, or to representatives of the Communist parties. After 1991, the circle was of course enlarged. There is free access to many documents. Researchers come here to work in the reading room. I imagine there's a lot more of them than before? Yes, lots more. Of course, some documents remain confidential. They are in restricted access, for now. M. N. Roy's face suddenly appears on the rolls of microfilms as he was in spring 1920 when he first met Lenin, where the latter welcomed him, exclaiming. "You are so young! "I expected a grey bearded wise man from the East." Which didn't stop him submitting to comrade Roy, for criticisms and suggestions his theses on the colonies. I return to the Russian Archives of Social and Political History, formerly the Institute of Marxism-Leninsm, formerly the Archives of the Communist International, fully aware that I won't have time to see the documents kept here regarding Roy. Lazar Heifitz, a Comintern historian, will speak to me, painfully of the opening of these archives in 1991 when he discovered authentic pieces undermining his previous works based on the only accessible source of Soviet historical fiction. Lazar Heifitz welcomes me with his son Viktor, also a Comintern specialist in their apartment in St. Petersburg. That's their arrival in Petrograd? Yes, at Moscow Station. It's the delegates' welcome. There's John Reed, Philips, Roy. Between their personal archives and those preserved in Moscow with all its bureaucratic ecstas, You are taking quite a lot. You're taking lots of files! I'am taking all these. Yes... Thanks you. In one of the first files, Mexico reappeared dramatically with 2 letters addressed to the Comintern, in the summer of 1920 during the Congress. The first, signed by an anarcho-syndicalist leader denies Roy any representation, treating him as schemer, a secret agent, an ambitious politician, whose social circle is incompatible with working class aspirations. In the second, Cervantes Lopez, Secretary of the Mexican Socialist Party, denounces Roy's communist party of being infiltrated by the police and of having ties with the president of a capitalist republic, and of having ties with the president of a capitalist republic, mixing with Wall Street plutocrats. Carranza knew Roy well. Simply because the political circle was very small, a few hundred people. But what does "knew well" mean? Did Roy and Philips knew Lenin well? There were one or two days, in Petrograd, when they could communicate largely and at length. But where is it recorded? Nowhere! It's an established fact: Roy and Philip's presence at the opening of the 2nd Congress of the Comintern. But there's a subtle nuance: there were lots of people but only 4 strangeres! Bombacci, Roy, Philips and Evely Roy! The Comintern's problem I think, at the very start, was to be short of people! Roy, among the few who were there, and there were Indians already... - Indians of the Tashkent group... - Of course Roy stood out perhaps as the most informed, the most perceptive. And above all, we have to return to Borodin here, Borodin had recommended him. - Borodin had a fantastic influence! - Yes, he was very powerful. That's how it came about: Borodin saw in this Mexican Communist Party leader still then socialist a man who could prove to be useful not so much in Mexico itself, as in Asia... - In all the colonial East... - Simply because he was Indian. And an interesting person with ideas who could become the leader of an anti-colonial, anti-British movement in Asia. "We hereby attest that comrade Roy was sent to Tashkent "to represent the Executive Committee of the C. I "on a mission in the East. "All competent Soviet authorities are asked to offer him assistance. "Nikolai Bukharin." M. N. Roy's first internationalist mision: he leaves for Soviet Turkestan, aboard a special 27=wagon convoy, trasporting arms, ammunition and a war chest, destined for the national insurrections in the region. He must organise a military school in Tashkent intended for the militant Islamists who have taken refuge there, to support them in their anti-British battle and, incidentally, convert them to Bolshevism. Thus, one year after the foundation of the Mexican Communist Paarty, M. N. Roy is involved in creating another communist party. this time an exiled, Indian One, but still as small: 7 members including Roy and wife Evelyn. It's n old idea: attack England via India. The first to think of it were Czar Paul I and Napoleon. They wanted to send an expeditionary force to India to attack England. That was late 18th, and early 19th century then, in the 20th century, it was the communist movement. Theorectically if the Bolsheviks had decided to organise such an attack on England via India, it would have definitely been via Tashket! And from Tashkent, Roy built his Indian revolution, even trying to contact the most eminent of bourgeois nationalists, Gandhi, who never responded. The English did not really appreciate these insurrectional plots on their Empire's border. They put pressure on the Soviets while negotiating a major trade agreement. The Tashkent School is dismantled in March 1921 and leads to the creation in Moscow of the Communist University for the Toilers of the East where Roy becomes one of the directors and Evelyn, one of the teachers. I look for the building somewhere behind Pushkin Square and the Rossia cinema which has become a casino, cluttered with sad neon lights from where a voice erupts praising by loudspeaker, the place's comfort and luxury. I end up finding the supposed house where apprentice revolutionaries from Asia Including Ho Chi Minh in 1922 Followed courses on the history of the worker's movement and insurrectional military technic. from the end of Summer 1921 Roy feels restricted by his academic duties. He complains to Karl Radek and Grigori Zinoviev the Secretary and President of the international about how his Indian students are demoralized by the lack of clothing and food but above all by the uselessness he feels, staying in Moscow when a new propaganda base is needed to develop the nascent Indian communism. He suggests Germany. In April 1922, his request is finally heard: Roy and Evelyn move to Berlin. They publish a journal there: "The Vanguard of Indian independence" that they manage to send illegally to India. It's during this stay in Berlin that Roy becomes attached to the country to its language and way of thinking. He weaves links with communist leaders including August Thalheimerand Heinrich Brandler who will become future alias in the anti-stalinist battle. But for now, Roy is a faithful agent of the international ready for all missions. in the middle of the bills, I come across this spy accessory: Roy's code, his Coded alphabet, allowing him to correspond secretly with Moscow. in 1923 he was in Berlin for the preparation of the German revolution. He is in the group preparing for the November Revolution: Roy, Gouralsky... Bela Kun, Tukhachevsky... Tukhachevsky had been there a while and Stassova too. it was a large group that he was in direct contact with. He was there precisely because of his contacts in Germany. And then there were other objectives. Berlin was an important centre for Indian immigration. They had a committee. There was the possibility of using these Indians in Berlin to organise in India a movement of considerable size. "Paris was an excellent centre for our work for 6 months. "We did a lot there, as you'll see in my report. "We were in close and constant contact with India, "where our influence on the national liberation movement "was appreciable a reinforced. "That's why the English decided to demolish our Paris centre, "and drive me back, where I couldn't maintain contact with India. "I'm afraid I'll no longer be able "to stay in any European country. "I wait your instructions. with communist greetings Roy." - When did he write that? - in 1925. M. N. Roy bases in Europe are dismantled, he returns to Moscow. But Evelyn, this time, will not follow him. The caos of the secret lifestyle, takes its toll on their marriage, she goes back to the USA in 1926. Roy reaches the peak of his duties within the comintern becoming a member of the Presidium, the Secretariat, the Orgburo end of the editorship of the Communist International revue. He's at all the demonstrations: his tall silhouette seen hovering behind Kalinin, Stalin, Vorochilov and Trotsky at Dzerjinsky's funeral the head of the Cheka, the political police. Here he is an apparatchik in. Moscow, when he wanted to be the man of action in India. And finally, Stalin sends him to China to apply is contradictory directives faced with Chang Kai-Chek's Kuomintang Nationalists. The latter, ends up eliminating bloodily his allies from the Chinese Communist Party and will send back home the powerless Soviet advisors among them an old acquaintance: Mikhail Borodin. "Canton, Soviet consulate 1927" Borodin represented the Soviet Union... - He was a soviet citizen - ...and the Party. While the Comintern was represented by Roy. in China that all ended, Independently of Roy, independently of Borodin and our military advisors with Chang kai-Shek's Coup d'etat. Even if Roy accelerated it a little. He acted like an elephant in a China shop calling for the immediate creation of Soviets! in fact, his position was closer to Trotsky's but he also collaborated with Bukharin's close associates. Roy wasn't excluded for being Trotskyite, but for being right-wing! it's quite simple: at the end of the 20's, early 30's the most shining figures, - the most Independent... - and who couldn't be brought into line! Togliatti was totally independent but he knew to stop himself. Roy wouldn't stop! According to the customs established in Lenin's time, which were not simple neither they considered that they had the right to speak, thing and act, as they liked. For that, one could criticize them, but without the sanctions of the apparatus. But the situation swiftly changed. Most didn't understand, Roy included, what meant the Stalinisation and bureaucratisation of Comintern. Confidential Personal To comrade Stalin Attached is the resume of the letter we received from Comrade Roy. strictly confidential Resume of the letter from com. Roy "Berlin, 9 November 1928 "Dear Comrades, "The intrigues of some people on the comintern on E. C. apparatus "to whom for some reason unknown to me, "I am a Persona non grata, "have been successful in shutting me out of all effective political work. "are virtues essential for a true revolutionary. "After a revolutionary career of over 20 years "and with the enemy hunting me down, "I am treated by the international as if I were not worth 2 cents. "Dear Comrades, "I consider it my revolutionary duty to express my views, nevertheless "In the absence of fearless criticism of our defects "and free expression of views, "the International suffers from intellectual stagnation, "which I have heard Comrade Bukharin often complain. "This stagnation will not be broken "by throwing out those who recognise the situation as deplorable and endeavour to improve it "To return to India, under any condition, "prepared to meet the inevitable consequences it is the only way left to me dear comrade I must speak openly "and do not know to whom else I could do so. "with communist greetings, M. N. Roy." just after, in the same folder, two letters: a first that confusedly accused M. N. Roy of wanting to steal a document in an empty office and yet for all to see; then another criticizing his poor Marxist-Leninist knowledge and of daring to compare his works to those of Marx or Lenin. It ends with a phrase that makes clear the benefit a false trial would soon have been able to draw from this: "When asked for news of his health he replied that he was sick "physically and politically "it was impossible, during the discussion "to decipher a more accurately the meaning of these words. "19 June 1928" in fact this photograph was always published like that. it was famous. But I think it was retouched so much so that this face was no longer visible. it could be even framed a bit larger, as all the rest was retouched. These faces should not be seen. It was to look pretty much like that. - Yes, you could see the column... - The column and Lenin in full. All The rest was retouched. - Who survived on this photo? - Well, from left to right Karakhan... Karakhan was shot, Radek, short, Bukharin, short, Lashevich, a Military Chief, was shot, Zinoviev was shot, Philips was expelled from the American CP, Our hero is hidden... Roy was expelled from the party, Evelyn Roy, perhaps you can tell us what happened to her? She died in the U.S.A. in the 70's. Bombacci was expelled from the Italian CP. And hung alongside Mussolini! Berzin was shot. Shot, deported, disappeared, exiled, these militants from start of the Communist International that M. N. Roy got to know more intimately, during informal meeting at the Comintern's residence, the Lux Hotel, whose heavy facede still stands on Tverskaya Street. It's with a nostalgic account of these drunken revolutionary nights that his unfinished "Memoirs" end: "The midnight surpper parties usually turned out to be very lively, And sometimes lasted until the early morning hours "It was on those occasions that important Communists "from different parts of the world "got acquainted with each other as human beings. "Trotsky as a rule avoided such occasions "where personal in habitations necessarily broke down. "Stalin was still not well very well-known "outside the inner circles of the Russian party "and had little to do with the Communist International. View was a conventional petit-bourgeois In his personal habits but bukharin, raidak and some other less known Russian leaders Usually join us in our night social gathering which were As a rule and envivened by singing and dancing However had a opportunity of living in the hotel luX Indore early days of the revolution must cherish the memory "as one of the richest experiences of his life." I return alone to the archives to settle the filming rights and I can't resist stealing some last shots of empty corridors, empty exhibition rooms Of this place keeping the memory of the Communist International that many people here don't want to know anything more about. Were they too free these men and women Who initiated the final struggle to emancipate humanity, Which Stalin crushed Worried as a good bourgeois Of the shaking With which the world revolution threatened the old order? What are you doing here with the camera? What have you go to smile about? There's nothing to smile about! How are we doing to deal with this? Run, run as fast as you can from this country, It's the only solution for M. N. Roy. "Political sick", as the letter denounced him, he is attacked for his theory of decolonisation, Judged right wing and reformist when he predicted that the British preferring a new market to a turbulent Colony, Will eventually grant India its independence. "Physically sick", because he had an ear infection that no one cures. He wanted to treat it in Germany, but could not get his passport back. Thanks to his Swiss mistress Leuise Geissler, and with Bukharin's in discrete support, Roy manages to leave the country with her in April 1928 on boarrd a flight for Berlin He will never return to Moscow and will be definitely excluded from the Comintern in 1929. PART II GERMANY, INDIA The Stations of East Berlin roll past, dulled by the night, the last station before the town's Western border, So hard to cross in the past. Today the crossing from East to West is imperceptible, to the soft, swaying rhythm of the train. Could M. N. Roy have imagined That the dream of freedom he cherished with his Comrades Was going to end in the building of a wall, Cutting through the town, his well-loved town Berlin Berlin, where he joined his Comrades Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer, within the KPO, Kommunistiche Partei Opposition, the Communist opposition to Stalin created in November 1928. Berlin, whose effervescence, intellectual and political he tasted as well as moral freedom. He continues his relationship with Louise Geissler, the escape from Moscow, his companion since the China adventure, at the same time as he falls in love with Ellen Gotschalk, a left-wing militant, 24 year old, born in Paris of an American father and a German mother and who he marries in Bombay in 1937. Dr. Theodor Bergmann is one of the last eyewitnesses of the anti-Stalin and anti-Nazi engagement, by the Communist Opposition, and M. N. Roy, conscious of an imminnent German catastrophe, after which nothing would be as before. Theodor Bergmann joined the KPO in 1929, while he was still an adolescent. I meet him in Stuttgart, 76 years later. "Land of Poets and Thinkers" Then I meet Kris Manjapra, a Canadian historian of Indian origin come to discuss his research subject with Dr. Bergmann: Indian revolutionaries in Berlin in the 20's and 30's. I realised to whay extent Roy's position was original then: inventing the third-wworld in advance while rejecting both the Communist dogma and the nationalist impulse. M. N. Roy knows what he's risking. Despite Brandler and Thalheimer's attempts to keep him he leaves Berlin for Istanbul reaching Baghdad then Karachi by road and Bombay where he arrived in December 1930 The British don't take long to spot and arrest him. At the Kanpur Court, he is condemnted to 12 years imprisonment for communist conspiracy against the Empire. Calcutta, Moscow, Tashkent, Peking... Some of Roy's lost worlds appear on the twinkling screen as my aeroplane is due to land at the International airport Indira Gandhi in Delhi. India, where the story of a free man begins and ends: Manabendra Nath Roy. I'm not very good with faces: will I recognise Hari Vasudevan this Indian historian, the first to talk to me of Roy and show me his photo? He's arranged for us to meet at the Indian International Centre a sort of dormant club, with undefine activities a1nd ideal decor for a Spy novel. Could he be this gentleman in the grey suit? No I don't know that face. But here comes Hari hurting in. I've no trouble recognising him, as he greets me with a "hello Volodia!" thundered in Russian, before leading us towards the dining room. I'm quite pleased to reminisce about M. N. Roy In a place with such English manners... Excuse me Madam, ...that he wouldn't have denied... Please Sir, ...In his inevitable gentleman's style that doesn't diminish the bohemian cosmopolite of Mexico, nor the restrictive Bolshevik nor the modesty of his lifestyle in India after leaving prison. I come back the next day to the Indian International Centre, to talk this time to Dr. Sareen, historian of Indian revolutionary movements abroad. Virendranath Chattopadhyay, one of the leaders of the Indians in Berlin, Abani Mukherjee, companion in the battles in Tashkent and Moscow, Crushed by Stalin's machine While Roy will be confined in India. Among his prison writings there is one I think of when I visit the tomb of Humayun, 2nd emperor of the Mughal dynasty. In this short essay, "The Historical Role of Islam", M. N. Roy exposes the civilising importance of the Muslim invasions thanks to it Scholars and philosopher precusors Of spectical, materialistic, even rationalist thinking which confirms on Islam its true historic role according to Roy: to undermine the basis of all religion! Armed with his heretical Paradox, he refused to favour either Indian Hindus or Muslims urging them to take from Islam its Enlightment's humanist lesson, rather than its dogmatic and obscurantist decline. To say the least, Roy was barely heard. Modern India will be born in the blood of inter-communal fights between Hindus and Muslims Which, in 1947, will cause more than 250,000 death, and force almost 10 million people into exodus, Of the newly-created Pakistani frontier. Religious conflicts that up to today threaten the country's stability as much internally, with frequent provocations by the extremists of both sides, as externally tensions with Pakistan have already provided the pretext for 3 wars, In 1949, 1965 and 1971. For now, India is at peace and celebrates, a few days Republic Day, Commemorating the declaration of the Indian Republic On 26 January 1950. But it's another anniversary that causes me to leave Delhi and arrive, after a night train at the town of Dehradun Wherer on 25 January 1954 Roy died, exactly 50 years ago. I was hoping for a gathering some sort of commemoration In vain I question the employee at the Dehradun tourist office Who has obviously never heard of a M. N. Roy and takes me for a Crank. In the public garden in the town centre the statue of the Nation's Father take pride of place. And, a few paths away stands the statue of another of Roy's political opponents, Subhash Chandra Bose, leader of the Congress Party, Who, while he also opposed Gandhi on non-violence, took a position opposed to Roy's during the 2nd World War Creating an Indian Liberation Army for which he obtain support from Japan, Nazi Germany and Italian fascists. Neither and orange flower garland nor a chubby statue of M. N Roy: the hermit of Dehradun no longer exist for anyone here. I end up finding his address on an outlying Street, Mohini Road then his house, No. 13, at the end of a garden. That's where he moved in 1938 with Ellen Gottschalk, now Ellen Roy, and where he lived to the end of his life. The house's current occupant welcomes me warmly. He introduces himself: S. N. Puri. I ask him if know M. N. Roy's story. He Smiles and leads me to the terrace of this white house that I recognize with emotion from the photo I've seen the only truly identified home of a Vagabond life. Despite his 98 years, The Royist enthusiasm of S. N. Puri has remained as vigorous as during their first meeting in 1936. S. N. Puri's grandson, a young entrepreneur has joined us. He'd like to turn the house formerly headquarters of the "Renaissance Institute" created by M. N. Roy Into a computing school. He tries to convince me that he's interested in Roy's philosophy In so far as it is constitutes a new fascism a fascism where all would not be as bad as they say. I am stunned and try in vain to refute an assertion so contrary to Roy's commitments In his prison writings, He was already wary on the complicity between fascist ideology and Hindu "spiritual nationalism". He wrote "Hitler's Germany has almost all the spiritual characteristics "to guarantee it has sympathisers "among the most orthodox nationalist Indians" The small white house on Mohini Road suddenly seems fragile to me, its well-kept garden and the memories that still haunt it but for how long? Those of Roy and Ellen Gottschalk, tireless humanist militants those of the dear friends who came here, like Ruth Fischer, figure of German communism Who posed on the terrace with one of the house's many cats. On Bengal and Calcutta road I stop at Banares the scared city on the banks of the Ganges. The evening, I walk along the ghats there I enter the backstreets and cross the hurried funeral processions, carrying the bare corpses, swaddled in bright colours to the cremation logs. On Dasasvamedha road there's a more frenzied procession: decorated tanks, followed by young men dancing brusque and slender. I don't know where to take shelter from all this fervour, that scares me a bit, and I land up in a restaurant Perched on the roof of a house along the Ganges. Like a secret talisman for crossing the exalted crowds I recall M. N. Roy's brutal phrases regarding Hinduism, described as the "ideology of social slavery" whose so-called spiritual heritage had resulted in "political slavery for nearly a 1000 Years, "economic backwardness, intellectual inertia and cultural degradation." The ignorant and repressed people are the "product of a decayed civilization "awaiting a much delayed burial." Roy continues: "This country needs a kemal Pasha, "to chop off the ridiculous tufts on the heads; "to make the wearing of mustaches punishable as culpable homicide; "to prohibit the irritating chanting of rigmarole "in a language which few understand." But who in India was ready to listen? Today what still strike me, and above all here in Banares, Is the feeling of a lack of history: the rite that spreads to all that surrounds it, The bodies, gestures, attitudes, the way of dressing. From his youth as a nationalist conspirator, he retained this taste for solitude and intrigue Choosing these cremation places for his long meditative walks as for the secret meeting places of his groups of insurgents. An over-worldly revolutionary in Mexico, a Bolshevik, far too out of control in Mexico, a communist, trough anti-Stalin in Berlin, member of the Congress Party but anti-nationalist and anti-Gandhi, in India: Roy's position had always condemned him to isolation. This solitude, Which while it can be that of poets, philosophers, fools, was no doubt incompatible with the ample political, democratic and radical movement that Roy planned to found on his release from prison in 1936. A Peaceful but absolute reforms of Indian society that M. N. Roy, despite the strict restrictions imposed on him for reading and writing, had drawn up, during his 6 year in detention with the European Renaissance and Enlightment as his horizons. This man, alone in a huge country, Would he be heard by history and age-old traditions? I arrived at the time given by Hari Vasudevan In front of the "Renaissance publishers" shop sign formerly headquarters of Roy's Renaissance Institute. I find the door closed. So I go to the Indian Coffee House where Roy often dropped by he, the connoisseur of large cafes, since Sanborn's in Mexico or the Romanische Cafe in Berlin. Here, he found collaborators and friends including Samaren Roy, who was 20 year old in 1939 when they met during a discussion on the Theory of Relativity. Samaren, surprised that a political leader was interested in physics, heard Ellen Roy reply, that Albert Einstein was a friend in the Berlin years. He was one of those with Nehru and Henri Barbusse, who protested to the British authorities against, Roy's prison conditions. it's in his house in Behala, near Calcutta where I meet Samaren Roy. I'm accompanied by Jharna Bose. It was with Jharna in Paris that I met Hari Vasudevan and heard of M. N. Roy for the first time. 1940: M. N. Roy supports the "anti-fascist war" and the British. And here's the famous photo again. What I discover for the first time, however, is this version of the escape from Moscow, that Samaren Roy had from Louise Geissler's sister: At the larger book fair in Calcutta, I daren't believe it: but I come across a "Renaissance Publishers" stand, with a fantastic selection. Besides the most recent works, like Samaren Roy's studies or Roy's last biography to date by Sibnarayan Ray, copies of "The Marxian Way" are on sale, a Royist quarterly published between 1945 and 1949 and even a tract by the Radical Democratic Party for the 1946 election. I buy a load of dusty books, that I buy into straight away. And the political plan conceived by M. N. Roy appears to me in all its excess. In a country where the social classes seem fixed foreve, made immutable by an ancestral caste system, he imagines a fully participative democracy, animated by Citizens Committees, elected in each locality. Organs of discussion and power, the committees would be places for the political education of citizens, invited to fill the decision-making roles, with no consideration of class, cast or religion. Persuaded that the end of the war Would be quickly followed by Indian Independence In 1944 he drafts a constitutional plan for India, and works on a plan for economic development The "People's plan"; socialist Inspired. To carry out his reforms, he leaves the left-wing of the Congress Party and found the Radical democratic party But the Royist failure in the 1946 general elections and the brutality of the Independence process in 1947, end the hopes of an institutional overthrow of the established order. Disillusioned with political actions, Roy dissolved his party in 1948 and began his last battle intellectual and philosophical. He created the Radical Huminist Movement, placing educational and liberty for the individual as a precondition, and Central to the project for social emancipation. I hadn't expected such a Russian ambience in the home of Purobi Roy historian of Soviet Indian relations Who welcomes us in her house in the centre of Calcutta. We drink tea there served with jam like at the datcha. and while she tells me her memories of the putsch attempt in August 1991. that give power to Boris Yeltsin, I realise that the place he occupied opposite Gorbachev Isn't unlike that of Subhas Chandra Bose opposite Roy: On the one side decisive politics, Sometimes brutal, cynical but popular; On the other the Idealist which in fact will never be forgiven for attacking the institutional values and power as and just as it was. Ah, but there's Bose! There's still Bose! there's lot of them! It's a fan club! He seems a little military, all the same. My mother adored him. But women adore Bose? it's extraordinary! - No, it is not extra ordinary. it's normal! - yes? Oh, I must have lost a pearl. Oh! just now, do you think? A. Viswanathan, film director asks if I can come and help to rehearse the Russian replies of Tom stoppard's "Travesties". I don't resist the pressure of meeting a Bengali Lenin. It is the same 20th century, That we have lived, from one continent to the other? And if learning has a Bengali action here, Roy himself become the most germanic of Indians as confirmed to me by Sibnarayan Ray, writer and essayist, Collaborator and friend of Roy then of Ellen Who starts our interview with a quote by Eric formm, Psychoanalyst, close to the Frankfurt School. We agreed, with Samaren Roy for him to show us the places of Roy's youth, at the time when he was still called N. Batthacharya Son of a Brahmin of the Calcutta region. But Samaren couldn't make it. He entrusted me to a friend, Who took his place as a guide. I slowly discovered that the friend only vaguely knew our itinerary and nothing on Roy's history. So we drove across suburbs and dusty villages asking our way to uncertain destinations that we miraculously ended up reaching. A group of village people, neighbours, passes by everyone come to help me. They showed me a street, a house: Is that where Roy was born? where he lived? No one knew, but all had something to say. And I hardly believe my eyes when we reached Harinabhi's School The place of young Narendranath's first engagements. In 1905 he organised a demonstration against the partition of Bengal by the British Which had him immediately expelled. Of these years, he later wrote: "When, as a schoolboy boy of 14 years, I started my political life "I wanted to be free. "Independence, complete and absolute, is a modern idea. The old-style revolutionaries thought in terms of Liberty. "At that time, we had not read Marx. We knew nothing of the proletariat's existence. "However, lots of ended our life in prison or at the gallows. "And it wasn't the proletariat who pushed them forward. "They were not conscious of the class struggle. "They did not dream of communism. "But they reponded to an ardent desire for revolt "against the intolerable living condition. "It's with this with spirit that I started my political life. "That's where I draw my inspiration "rather than from 3 volumes of Capital or the 300 volumes of Karl Marx." I've returned to Delhi for a last meeting. I must meet V. M. Tarkunde, magistrate and lawyer former leader of Roy's Radical Democratic Party and co-signatory of his people's plan for Economic Development. Staunch defender of rights he remains faithful to the preceps of Radical Humanism and welcomes me with great kindness accompanied by his sister and a family friend. In his theoretical summary "Reason, Romanticism and Revolution" Roy writes: "History is a record of human activities. "Political institutions were created by man. "Yet these creations of man have reduced man to nothingness. "The complete subordination of the creative to his creation "is the core of the present crisis. "Therefore, a humanist revival, "that is the restoration of man "in his proper place of primary and sovereighty, "is the only way out of the crisis." In Delhi, I visit the observatory of Jai Singh, enligtened Sovereign and reputable astronomer Who built several fantastic structures in the 18th century, borrowing from the Muslim and western astronomical knowledge of his time. Today, few know there exact use Other than the children who use them as carrousels. Roy's struggle dreaming of an emancipated humanity lost or not, forgotten or not, still call for new fighters. Jai Singh's ramps and mysterious sundial as well as our current telescopes Observe the same stars, unreachable, but which light our nights with the same fire. transcribed by rforrudy
