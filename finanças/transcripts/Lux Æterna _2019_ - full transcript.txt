You cannot imagine the supreme happiness an epileptic feels in the moments before a fit. I would give perhaps my whole life in exchange for a few seconds of that felicity. You are about to see old images of the Middle Ages. The big witch hunt we will discuss is one of the major catastrophes in man's history. To try and understand it, we must bear in mind that it took place in a dark age of our history, both spiritually and materially. The genuine fear of Hell weighed constantly on people's minds. Let's take a look at the women burned at the stake. We filmmakers have a big responsibility. It is up to us to raise the film from an industry to an art form. Save me from the stake, or else... Burn the witch! You will go with the Devil. Hypocrite! Liar! To make the wonderful image in DAY OF WRATH of the witch who lands on the bonfire, the actress was on top of her ladder for two hours. It's no wonder her face bore a real expression of horror. Can we stop that hell? Have you been burned at the stake? - Like we'll do later. - No... It's classy. - Oh yeah? -Yeah! - Have you? - Sure. I think it rocks. It's so chic. You're queen of the village. Really! It's then or never. Either you've been a beauty queen or burned at the stake. So... since I've never been Miss France, sometimes I say I'm Miss Dreux. Miss Dreux is chic. KINGDOM OF FRANCE 2019 But the most beautiful death... the most... is Christ. You know, I go to church, you believe or not, up to you. I respect people, who cares! But it's pretty classy! Really... Whoever scripted the Passion... Oh yeah. We learned a new word today: "Sexocide." Sexocide: the genocide of witches. Because they're women. Did you...? Let's see your ears. Do you have it? Fuck! We've got the witch sign. That too you know... Not having your earlobe cut, was a sign of recognition for witches. Outside, easy to see. Women got burned for that. You don't have it, but you do have pierced ears. I'm Top Witch! Fuck! Redheads, witches... And that too... One thing was really horrible when I played a witch. To check you were really a witch, they dunked you in water. If you drowned, you weren't a witch. So we did that. Except the witches were naked... and you're shooting in an Italian village with loads of guys dressed Medieval to look the part, because that's when the film was set. You climb a mountain, naked. With 2,000 guys there. I swear... I'd say it's the worst memory of my life. You've got 2,000 men scoping you naked. Climbing! Not posing. You're climbing, in crappy positions... looking ridiculous and baring all. I'd be happy to climb if I had your body. Fuck! The film is beautiful, so it's ok. But when you're doing it... the end justifies the means. It's okay. Really! I've worked with guys... where I'm told he's a prick. I'm not looking to make friends. I don't give a shit. Some directors are pricks. If he's really cool, it's a plus. But it's no big deal. If he takes me on his trip on screen... Know what I like best? When you don't question. Something totally unlikely happens, you can't explain it... and you don't try to. You don't ask why. It runs deeper than that, the guy takes you on his trip, into his mind, his brain. The actor? The director? Huh? The director? Yeah. I personally... I'm not criticizing, people make movies or watch them for what they get out of them. Fuck entertainment movies! They bore me. But if people like them, who am I to say they're crap? I need to get inspired or carried away... It's like drugs... Or... Why am I comparing it to drugs? See? - Sometimes I talk so much it drives me nuts. - No it's better. Honestly. Imagine if I took fucking speed... What I wanted to say is... When I arrive in paradise and My Lord and Master is there... - You think that? You're a real believer? - Hell, yes! I don't believe in anything. I do! Yes, I do! Jesus...? I've been doing deals with him all my life. I swear. I say: c'mon, if I do this, it'll be ok? And since he's never answered, I say it's cool. Did Jesus speak? "Don't do it, don't take that shit!" He said nothing. He won't like the film you're making... The day he says: "you're screwing up!" I won't do it. But the day I arrive in Paradise and my Lord and Master is there. In the afternoon He'll say that I spent my life talking about Him, hyping Him up. I'm likes His agent! And when he sees me, he comes to meet me at the gates, he'll take care of me. He'll teach me tons. Loads. It'll be fab. Most filmmakers today are like the living dead and their films are just like them. The bonfire scene will look beautiful. Yes. - Have you ever burned at the stake? - No, not at the stake, but I've burned... in a tent. That is so un-cool. It looked great. - I'm sure. It's the way you said it. - Under branches... - I'm sure it was beautiful. Everything you do is beautiful - No, but... In any case, it was... Yes. I burned. - I've never seen you in anything tacky. - But not at the stake! Sure, I've done loads... - Maybe! I don't remember that. - Not at the stake. You have? Yes. It was classy. But the ridiculous thing was... the producer was there and I'm on my stake, with the wool robe and my hair chopped.... Super sexy. Bonfires are super sexy. It ends badly but it's uber-cool. When you get to the bonfire... You're on a donkey. Hopping with fleas but so cute! I swear! You go through the village, everyone points... It's so sexy! When you get to the bonfire the producer comes up and doesn't find it sexy. The wool robe... with no lingerie... it didn't suit the scene. He takes something to cut it. A blade or knife or whatever. And he slits it open here, and on the thigh. I say: "You've lost the plot!" - No shit. - Low-cut! I remember a film with a real pretty actress in the 1950s, where she falls and her dress opens. You see her garter belt, she's posing. Nobody falls into a perfect pose! It was funny. But on a bonfire... showing a... It wasn't the director, he wasn't a prick. It was the producer, a total stereotype. The Italian producer who wants it sexy. Totally "woman" ... Weird. But it's a good film, so who cares. - No, I've never seen you in shit films. - Oh sure, I've done loads. We all did! It's like the ugly guy. There's always one, when you list who you've scored, you list the hunks. Or not just hunks, the class acts. There's always a loser you leave out. We all have one. A loser you leave out. Or a guy who gives you the creeps... There's always a dead rat somewhere! I had one who wasn't a creep. Poor guy, he was real cute, but so young. I was older than him. And... it was the end of the film, we had to... get together. And... he ejaculated on my leg. For real! But it didn't creep me out. - He was moved! - Yeah. Poor guy, he was so young. - How young? 16? - Yes! - That's 6 years too old! - That happened to me in a movie theater, I was with friends... - Gross! - Vile. There were loads of people... - How did it happen? We were waiting in line. I must have been touching the guy, jeez! Like you didn't know! No, honestly. I'm with my punk pals... We go in and as I walk by I feel something on my leg. Right then, you can't imagine it. You don't get it. Then I realize. I was with a hardcore punk. He bust the creep's brains! I said: "Dude! You behaved badly. You're gonna regret it." Seriously. Ah, no! Me, I practically apologized. You're nuts! - Fuck! He must have felt bad. - He was very embarrassed. Totally. - So you were naked, for you to realize? Slightly undressed? - Yes. We were totally naked! Under the sheets. The director told him he should have jerked off beforehand. It's no big deal. But I guess... Oh boy! I've had love scenes where the set designers... I remember once in Miami... A love scene, you've done the scene and God knows why, the set designers insist on taking their sheets and pillows right there, when you're butt naked. You're not some porn actor, all relaxed. Generally, you're not relaxed, being naked... - None of that here? - No. We didn't tell you about the gangbang scene? We kept it as a surprise! No sweetie, I won't pull surprises like that. Hey presto! A hard porn scene. No way. I keep banging on, maybe you want to rest up? - Concentrate. - No, but... when do we start? Now. When everyone's ready you'll go to makeup to get prepped. The crew's cool, you'll see. But then there's Tic and Tac. They're... my ball and chain. Fagin and Scrooge. - The producers. - Who? The producers, you'll see! Stereotypical pricks. - They're here? - All the time. All the time! Everywhere I look, they're in my frame! Like a curse! Nobody sees them. But I do, everywhere. They do my head in. Can you do what you like or not? They have no choice. They can't force anything on me. They've signed the contract. Like I say: "You wanted me, you got me!" Deal with it. I'm a nice person. I've got a big mouth, whatever. I'm nice. I respect people. But if you piss me off... It all vanishes. All of it. Ok, babe? You busy? I won't answer that. If it's the... tiebreaker. Don't push it! I have a friend from L.A. here. - Say that again, babe! I love it, "from L.A." - From Los Angeles. I got it, I'm not dumb. He's flown over, an 8 or 9 hour flight... He'll see us tomorrow. He'll still want to. - They say they're busy. - Hello. - I'm Karl. - Why me? You're a prick-magnet! He's my bro! Bad timing. Beatrice! Can we start? Clara! Can you take care of Charlotte? Please, we don't need to talk to him now. We're ready. Right behind you. What are you doing? - I follow you? - Yes please. - Who's that guy? - No idea. Check out the L.A. loser. - Who's this? - Mica, the construction manager. Hi, Mica! He seems happy... - So, for the next scene... we go straight in... -First we see the actresses to reassure them. And we do a run-through, a rehearsal with everyone. I hear you, Maxime. But there's a problem: you're committed. - Yannick... - I wouldn't be funding this if you weren't here. Tell me you didn't know. - We know she's an actress. - You knew! It's her first film. You've worked with losers. You drove them. I'm won't name names. You've worked with the greats, but also with losers - This one's a loser. - No! Listen... If you knew, it's bad. If you knew, it's bad. Bad for the film. Bad for the crew. Bad for me. It makes me sick. Sick. - You need to take a step back. We're a bit late. We can catch up. - No! It's more than a bit. - I'm counting on you. - It's more than a bit. It's a fucking catastrophe. Listen, of course it's a catastrophe, I've pumped 80% of my cash into this. Beatrice Dalle is a name. Right now you're nobody, ok? So you'll do her movie. I'm asking you to do it, ok? You do the movie. You don't listen to her. You make the decisions. You're not the DP, you're the director, ok? You're in the driver's seat. Ok, I'm the driver. Can you fire her or not? It's very complicated. There's a contract. But I can try to fire her. I'll call my attorney. We'll see. Or... This might be crazy, but it's an idea: - Lola, where's Tom? I want to talk to him. - He's right there. Here, boss! - Tom... - Talk. You know Victor Hugo's poem, "The Conscience"? No? "The eye was in the grave, looking at Cain." I want you to be my eye. I want you to follow Beatrice day and night, to the bathroom if need be, with your camera and film her every move. I'll find a mistake. - And fire her for it. - Perfect, got it. Got it? We'll watch the footage every evening. Thanks. See? We'll be ok! You'll take over if I fire her? - But I... - Max? Max? Deal. - I don't know... I don't know. Honestly, no... - Thanks, Max! Where did you get this assistant? - She sucks! - You wanted an amateur crew. She's a waste of space! Pretty, but useless. - It's your DP who sucks! I could stick his zoom up his ass! Wait till we've wrapped. He's 60 and can't light shit! Professional my ass... Listen to me for a second. You got cash? The druggist's here. He's got the sedative. Take it from my purse. - I'm doing it for you. - I know, let's roll... Burn some witches! - We start soon. See you over there? - Yes. Coming. - Seriously... Back to hell. - Time to get moving and do a run-through. - Everyone listen, please! Felix, you translate. I'd just like to say to my princesses that... if they have a question or want any directions, if they want reassurance, or need my advice, I'm here for them now. So they can ask any questions. - What kind of makeup? - I want her to feel good. So ask her how she wants her makeup, how she feels beautiful, I need her to feel strong and reassured. So ask her, ok? Beatrice! Can you come here? - Yes, Judas. So what's the problem here? - No problem, we're debriefing. Don't be paranoid. I'm not, I'm asking a question, calmly and politely, so answer me the same way. - It's not calm or polite. - Max! Respect... What did I say? Max, what did I ask? - You're here to supervise Beatrice, you're her DP... - I can't stand it. If you can't stand it, leave. Ok? I can't stand it either but I shut up. We'll talk over here, we're heading for disaster. - Not now! - We're heading for disaster. You need to wind down. Disaster? I've been waiting hours! Asking for rehearsals, places to meet and talk. And I keep being told to wait. And this DP who... - Calm down! - What? I'll calm down if I want! - Why the hysterics? - Not now. And you? What is this? The Cannes film festival? Taking photos! Stop! Ok. Can someone bring Charlotte to her dressing room or she'll leave? And she'll be right. - Charlotte, we're almost ready. - At Cannes, you'll kiss my ass! - Do you need anything? - You'll never be at Cannes! I am Cannes! Go produce your ham ads! My ham ads pay for this film! - It's not my fault... - Clara, can you take Fanny on set? Felix! Handle this. I want a rehearsal now. I alone believed in your project. And you're grossly ungrateful! You're not involved! I'm waiting for hair and makeup... and you want me on set when they're not ready? - You don't respect me or the project! - Be respectable to earn my respect. - Wait, babe... - This is not the time! - It's never time. - I'm working! And for you it's never time! - Are they ready? Paul, please... - We need some privacy. You need privacy? Everyone out! Everyone who's not needed please leave. - Is she ready? - I just started her hydration. Hydration! Fucking jargon. Don't you start! Seriously! Crazy bitch! - Bea, you're a fraud! - It's a status, at least! - 5 minutes to finish. - Hey girls, hurry up! - You can finish on set. - No we can't. - I know my job, ok? - Can we get the stand-in? We're on our way. About time. - The camera's ready? - 5 or 10 minutes. 5 or 10 minutes? - 10 minutes. - Maxime, this is Fanny. - Fanny, Maxime. - Hello, Fanny. Momo! Can you angle the red lights? Is the lighting ready? Can we rehearse? I won't talk to you now. Not now, please! Dumbass, I've said nothing and bust no-one's balls. Felix! Handle the stand-in so he won't bug her. Launch the blue sky! Not blue! The sky for the film. - Where are the extras? Who's the bum, where's Abbey? - The sky for the film, Ernesto! All ready, Ahmed? Ready? Lighting! Stop fighting! Get moving, not a single shot is ready! Shit! Hello, I'm from Cinematic Eye magazine. We met at the Female Film Festival in Montreuil. I mean Creteil... Would it be possible to get some info... A few facts and figures on this shoot. - Know what? Go ask the boss! He's running the show. - I don't want to be a bother. - But you are! - Extras! Extras on set now! Extras on set now, please! Clara, send the fucking extras now! Extras on... Wait! - I'm the boss! Extras on set now! Get Yannick, please! I've had it, I'm leaving. What can I do here? What is this production? We've been waiting since 8 am! Fucking union extras! I'll bust the fucking set! - Beatrice on set! What can I do? When do we eat? We've been here 5 hours! With no food, no drink! We're not cattle! Clara, get sandwiches for the extras, please! Keep focused! - I'm an idiot. - Bright and eager! Time to go. - If you stopped shouting we'd be ready! What is this? - I'm not trying to shout. Let's go, she's waiting. We're bringing the actresses now. - Are you coming? - No! Beatrice! Come out here! For fuck's sake! Beatrice, I'm so sorry. I put my foot in it. I didn't think it'd be a bad time. - Come now or you burn! Not now! - I didn't mean to... No way! As you know, I started with Jean-Luc. So no little nobody is going to teach me my job. See? Jean-Luc was no laugh. - But here... - Yeah, you said. - What's happening? - I don't know. - Is the focus ok? - I'm good. - Ok. Charlotte, you look... You look tired today. Are you doing any facial care? Like, a mineral cure...? I'm not so tired. Something with aloe vera or guarana seed? To help plump up the skin, because... Crew, listen up! I want only essential people on set! No parasites, it'll show onscreen. Beatrice, I got the message. - I'll let the artist work, but just two points beforehand. - Get your mitts off already. - You can sink my movie, but you can't sink my company. - You really think now is... - I've called my attorney. I've made arrangements. You'll see. I'll have the last laugh! Thank you for being here. I feel safer, you're fabulous. Charlotte, we're not done! We'll finish later. - I apologize for this chaos. We have a problem. - Me too, soon. Beatrice is an actress, not a director. I'll replace her with Max. It's a secret! Thank you for being here! Yes, we're coming. - Speed up. - I can't walk fast in these things. - Hang on, I need to make a quick call. - Not now. - Shall I go back? - No, we're in a hurry. You couldn't earlier? No! I need a place where I'm... alone. Charlotte! Sorry to bother you... I know you're about to shoot. I'm one of your biggest fans. I'm a journalist. I just wanted some info about the shoot. - Please, Dad! We'll do this later. - What to say? I haven't started... - Just a minute. - No, sorry. I can't. What a pain! He swore he wouldn't come. Who are these people? It's rude... If you let all these people in... I told you. - Be quick or I'll get shit. - I'll be quick. It's a TV set, but you can go in. Thanks. Keep in mind it's a dreamlike movie! It's not politics. It's poetry! We're making art, we're making a film! - Hello? - It's Charlotte. - Hello, madam. - All ok? - Yes, fine. - Is she alright? - I pass her to you... - Ok, thanks! - Hello, Mommy... - Yes, sweetie. All well? No, Mommy, not really. - At the canteen... - What did you say? - School wasn't good. - Why? What's wrong? At school today, Paul and Lucas... made a cross on my foo foo... with a knife. What? Are you kidding? They wanted to do a tattoo on my foo foo. - When, today? Yes, at the canteen. - Just a minute! Wait! - Be quick! Pass me the nanny, please. - Madam? - Hello? Yes... My daughter just told me something. Can you... can you check... Can you undress her and check that she's not hurt? - What do you mean? I don't understand. - She told me something. I'd like you to look, right now. - You undress her... - Yes. - You undress her now and look to see that she's not hurt. - Now? - Yes, now. - Ok. I hang up? Or stay on line? - No... I'll call back in 10 minutes. - Ok. - And you look, ok? Yes. I'll call back. Wait! - I won't have time after. - Not now. No! - Felix, where's Charlotte? Can someone get her? -C'mon, Charlotte! Ken will wire your mic. Careful. - I can sense you're down. Anything wrong? - Yes. I think I'll have to go home. - Because of the shoot? - No, not the shoot, but... - Can't you see we're talking? - Just a moment. She said two minutes, so wait, ok? Stop! Can't you see we're talking? You're on me every two minutes! - It's never the right time! - Fuck it! - I need to make a call. - Go ahead, darling. Take the time you need. What the fuck? You work for a tabloid or what? Come here! I do what I want! I'm the boss! What the fuck? My camera! It's Charlotte. No point leaving a message, but... can you call me back? As soon as possible. I'm worried, so... Leave me a message. Leave a message even just to say what... What you saw. And please tell her... I'll call back in 15 or 20 minutes. Tell her I'll be there as soon as I can. The filmmaker is the man who must leave his signature on a film intended as a work of art. - Ernesto! The sky! - You want to burn a witch! Ready for rehearsal! Ready for action? Keep angry! Rolling! End board! - Action. Rehearsal. Extras! Good. Cut! Cut! - Can't you keep rolling a little longer? - You should say what you want before! - Then talk to me! Communicate! - You can't cut after 3 seconds... It's 5! - Instead of bitching from the start! - Can you count to 5? Unbelievable! - Then I'd know what you want! It's only a rehearsal, dammit! - 1, 2, 3... Right. We shoot the next take. - We shoot this one? - We shoot this one. First positions, please! Extras, more anger! That was good. Shades off. We shoot this take! Is everyone ready? More anger, if possible. You curse them, you hate them, you're torching them! Evening, Charlotte! - Are the actresses ready? - Yes. Great! Thanks, girls. Can I have the music, please? Music, please! - Tie her wrist! - No music, they need 10 minutes. No music? If there's no rhythm, don't blame me, ok? - Nice and tight. Shoot without music! - Music's fine! - Sound rolling. First positions, please! "GOD'S CRAFT" 43A - Take 1 - end board. - Let's shoot! All ready? - Music! - Action! Music please! Yes! Yes, that's beautiful! Beautiful. Brilliant. It's so beautiful! Beautiful, Charlotte! Don't move! Ahmed! Stick the cross right on her chest! Yes! Charlotte! Look at God or at me! The stand-in has wrapped. Nothing works on this movie. It's a mess! I've never seen anything like it You're gonna burn, guys! Charlotte! Look at me! Yes, that's good! Higher with the cross! For Christ's sake, stay in position! It's not meant for her... Can you help her, please? Instead of just standing there? Put her shoes on. Action! You catch on fast. You're fitting right in with this god-awful shoot! You're getting stinky breath, just like the others. Cut! Shut up! We don't cut. I'm shooting. Fuck! When the pressure gets too strong I turn into a dictator. Max! What's that? Ernesto! What the fuck are you doing with the lights? What the hell's going on? DP! What's happening? What is this shit? What's going on? Don't worry, Charlotte. They're fixing the lights! What is this shoot? You're all fucking useless! Tell me what's going on, Mister Know-All! What is this shit? Stop! Cut! We'll shoot the next one. And fix the lights! Man, some shit's really happening now! It's starting to vibe, don't you think? Something's happening. Things are moving. And it's Cinematic Eye who told you. I'm fucking finished! You don't realize! If I'm finished, she is too! Did you film anything? Look! What did you film? - It's dead! - We need solid evidence to bring her down. - Her ex-agent says she could snort aspirin. Crackhead! She deserves the electric chair! A lethal injection in the ass from my attorney! - I'm sick of intellectual poverty! I've had it! - We can send her to the chair. Crucify her! - Can you stay with me? - No! - What is this? I'm blind! - Now I'm to blame for the fucked lighting? Beatrice Dalle? Beatrice Dalle? Beatrice Fail! - You'll repay every dollar I put in this fucking movie! - You're a producer, seriously? What the fuck is this in the middle of a shot?! Is it a nightclub? What the fuck? Lighting's your job, isn't it? Or am I talking out of my ass? - I'm the DP. Ernesto? - So who's responsible? Instead of taking the piss. Communicate! What are you a child? Fuck this! I'm on a zombie shoot. I get it, I'm making a zombie movie. Thanks for telling me. Now I know! You're the DP. You manage the gaffer, don't you? - You're in constant denial. - Who are you? - You're breaking my balls! - Who are you again? Remind me. Come down! Or I'll come get you. Ok? - Calm down. - What? Get off my case! I won't cool it. I do what I want. Now get down and we'll talk this out. Maxime, come down. Come down or you're fired. - All this is the logical outcome of the past week. Fuck! - Goddamn know-all! You can't even fix this! - Here's the result! - It's been an hour, no-one can cut the lights. Move it! Do something! - We're still rolling! - Stop! Get the girls down. No! You shoot zero! I decide! Yannick! Your DP is going crazy! Charlotte! We'll untie you! We're coming! - Beatrice? - Cut! - No, I don't want to cut. Fuck! Where's an assistant? - Untie me! Untie me! - Charlotte, you're burning! Beatrice! Untie me! Untie me! - You're insane! - Yes, that's it. Perfect! Max, come down or I'll come get you! Stop! Beatrice! - Max, get down and fix the lights! - Ask Ernesto, it's his job! Cry, Charlotte! Cry! Untie me! There. Go on. Make your body quiver! Tremble! You're burning! Imagine you're burning! You cry! More. You're burning, in pain! That's wonderful! Beautiful! Fabulous! Stop! Stop everything! Now! Please! Can someone help them? Silence! Silence! I'm shooting! Don't leave me... Why am I always alone like this? Please. Help me. Charlotte! We're there! We're getting somewhere! Charlotte?
