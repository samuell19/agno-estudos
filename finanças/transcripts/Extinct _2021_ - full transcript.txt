Meh! The day, August 17th. The year, 1835. The man, me. Ha! Charles Darwin. This morning, we set sail for our next grand adventure, the Galapagos. And whatever extraordinary creatures await me on these islands. Huh? There's one now. A blue-footed booby. Ah-ha! Blue... Booby. Booby. Booby. - Ah! - Booby. Ooh, er, Ed. This is embarrassing but you have a little... Um... Yeah, right there. You got it. Op, I know. Give me a hand. Booby. - He's fine. - OK, come on, brother. The other flummels are waiting for us. So, we're late. What's the worst thing that could happen? Oh! Got it! Got it! Listen up, flummels. The countdown to the flower festival has begun. So it's officially crunch time. Ah! Hey, Mali. Here we are almost right on time. Now, I know we don't have a lot of flowers but... But the ones we've got are different, dynamic and... Weird. The flowers, you, your brother, all weird. That's why no-one wants you around. Weird, weird, weird. All of it weird. Well, Ed, we gave it a shot. I thought they were nice. It's fine. I don't care what Mali thinks. What are you talking about? You care what everybody thinks. Not right now because I've got a big surprise for you. Ooh! A hat thing. It's not a hat thing. It's an official headdress for my new job. When we all march up the mountain for the flower festival, I'll be in one of the most important spots. The very back because I've been chosen to be the friend at the end. - But the back end. - It's a start. Mo, it's the opposite, it's the finish. - Still, it's an honour. - How were you selected? - Randomly. Well, I'm happy for you. You know what would make it even better? Op, I love you but this is my final chance to make a good impression with the rest of the flummels. And don't take this the wrong way, but please just try not to ruin this for me. - What's that supposed to mean? - Well, whenever you help, things tend to... - unravel. - Me? - You. - Never. - Always. - Just give me one example. Waterfall fail. Mango avalanche. Rock in the hole. The great fire. The greater fire. Mud for dinner. Tree skis. The burp-ening. Fish for hands. The rain thing. Bee tornado. Bee tornado two, the tropical swarm. And, of course, Coconut Charlie and the Jackfruit Jam Band. - So we've had our ups and downs. - Mainly downs. But think of those sweet, sweet occasional ups. And besides, you need to stop living in the past... ..and look to the future. Hi, er, Op. I just wanted to say, I like that spinning you do. Oh, thanks. I call it the Op Hop. I can teach you if you want. - You could? - Sure. Just do what I do. Huh! - Oh! - Bo, what have I told you about wandering off? - Not to. - Right. Especially in this direction. - Hm! - Hm! Are you working out? - Did you change your fur? - I combed it. Holes front, everybody. Get ready to give your undivided attention to the roundest guy around, the king ring of our hoop troop, J-J-J-Jepson. Hey, thank you, Mali. Thanks a bunch. Great stuff. Hey, everybody. All right, a little story just before we begin. Last night, I was doing some thinking, I was doing some math and I realised, hey, hey, this is the 100th flower festival. Such a round number. Get it? That guy gets it. I like that guy. So, anywho, I decided our theme this year, just like very other year, is flowers. Bloom! Ugh! Huh! - All right, cheer time is over. - All right! And, as always, I and the Grand Flower Flummel will lead us right to the top of the mountain to celebrate. And we'll all be there. Old flummels and young flummels, big flummels and small flummels, flummels who love the beach but especially he part where the sand is a little firmer... Ugh! Oh! I told you that branch wouldn't hold us. I don't remember you saying that. I thought it. Don't tell me, the weirdos. Great! We've been demoted to crab poking. Well, hey, at least you still have your job as the buddy in the back. Friend at the end. And with that headdress, you're gonna be asked for a lot of dances. I couldn't. I get nervous talking to girls that aren't you. I can't even talk to Vinnie since he grew his hair long. Sup? Hey, what's...? Looking good, looking good. Oh! Hey, look, it's Wally. - Hey, Wally. - Wally? Really? Now? - Hey, Wally! - We have crabs to poke. Get over here, buddy. I wanna hear what's been happening. Huh? Ho-ho! Hey, Op, I'm coming, don't you worry. We haven't talked since yesterday, so there's a lot to catch up on. Er, he's coming in pretty hot towards the beach - where all the flummels are working. - Ah, you're right. - Better shoo him off a bit. - Let's be honest, this all just is swimming. You can't call it a school and expect kids to be excited about it. - That's the same thing. - No, that was waving, this is a shooing motion. No, it isn't. This is a shooing motion. - More like this. - That's what I'm doing. - And we're done. Great work, everybody. And some great modelling, Kim. - Oi! - Guess what. Mr Seahorse is having a baby. - This is a shooing motion. - That's what I'm doing. - No. That's waving. Drinking seawater makes you go crazy - but, really, what else am I supposed to drink?-Waving. - No, shooing. - That's so waving. - That's shooing. - Waving. - Shoo... - Uh-oh!-Uh-oh! - I know blubber is just what it's called but that doesn't make it any less hurtful. - Oh! Oh! Save the Grand Flower, flummels!- Random question. Were you guys waving or shooing? Hi. I can explain. Oh, you two really did it this time. You really did it. Hey, where's your brother? - Ah! Ah! Achoo! - Whoa! - Oh! - Ugh! I really hope Jepson didn't see that. Jepson! You know, I'm patient. Oh, yes, I am. But sometimes a leader has to lead and that is why, Op and Ed, you are forbidden from coming to the flower festival. While we go up the mountain, why don't you two take some time and think about what you did on Desolation Rock? Oh, that's why it's called that. Let's go, everybody. And there goes my last chance to belong. Listen, Ed, I... - I know this seems bad but we can... - Don't bother. It's fine. I'm not mad, I'm just... used to it. Booby! Not now. I've got an idea. How do you talk me into these things? I finally understand why this is called the Forbidden-Don't-Go-Out-There- It's-Way-Too-Dangerous Zone. Look, we destroyed all the flowers, right? So we're gonna get more flowers no-one's ever seen before. And they'll have no choice but to forgive us. Now, come on, it's just a little bit fur... Whoa! Op! Oh, no! I knew it. Now I'm scared, stuck, alone and a little overweight. - What's wrong? - Oh, you're alive! OK. Ha! I was just making small talk. Looks like rain. No, it doesn't. - Look at this one. - Easy. - Oh, and this one. - Easy does it. - Whoa! I've never even seen this flower before. - I've got this. - Oh! - That means I get to name it. - No, I don't got this. - Opodils. No, that's stupid. - Operaniums. - Huh! - Magnoliops. - These are really nice. You know what? This may actually work. For sure, this is totally going to... Whoa! Don't even think about it. - Just a little more, Ed. - There is no more. OK, OK. Forget it. I think I can reach it. This is my life. What is that? What is that? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Yes, and it's amazing. It is amazing. What do you think it is? No idea. I've never seen anything like it. Do you think it's some kind of new whale? - Whale? What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - Op, what are you talking about? I'm talking about this gorgeous, glowing, swirling.... Oh! OK. Not good. Ed, help, pull me up. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - I'm tired from poking crabs. Booby! Huh! Oh! - Oop! - Yah! Oh, boy! - Argh! - Argh! Oh! Argh! - Oh! - Help me! Whoa! Oh! Oh, wow! - Wow! That's a... Wow! OK. - Ed, Ed, relax. - Think about it.-Uh-huh! - We went into a flower on Flummel Island, - then we came out of a flower in this place. - Mm-hm! Do you know what that means? Yes, yes! No, I don't. Do you? No, but it's still pretty wild, though. Oh! - Wait here. - Oh! Whoa! Hmm! Something's stuck. Hmm! Where are my mid-distance bifocals? Whoa. Oh, oh, oh. Oh! Ah! Oh! - Oh! - Nice reflexes. - Aww, cute. - Aww, cute. - Aww, really cute. - Aww, really cute. - Ah! Less cute. - Ah! Less cute. Oops! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop. What is happening? How did flower picking turn into whatever this is? Don't worry. I can fix this. Yeah? Fix that. Fix it? It's amazing. Amazing? Where are you going? Hmm! Ah! Ooh! Op, that mount you're on is moving. Whoa. Ed? - Oh! - Oh, er, Op, Op! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Ugh! Ugh! Ow! Oh! Whoa! Op! Op! Op! Op! Whoa! Ugh! Argh! Ugh! Oh! Oh! Ohhh! Op! Ow! Ow! Seems about right. Thanks for the lift. Oh, hey. Isn't this place great? We should have never left Desolation Rock. Come on. Your ideas have caused us nothing but trouble, so we're doing things my way, the Ed way. Ooh! What are you? You're the cutest things I've ever seen. Do you wanna come home and marry my dolly? And you can marry my cat. Why do you get the cat? I want the cat. - It's you again. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You got it all wrong. I'm here to help you guys. Sorry for being so rude back at the house. We dogs are very territorial, you know. - No. We don't know. - We don't know anything. Oh, well, let's start with the basics then. I'm Clarance and I'm a dog. Ruff, ruff! Well, hi, Clarance. I'm Op and this is Ed and we are... Oh, flummels. We'll save you. Er, guys? Wait, wait. No, no, you don't understand. No. Let me show you. Oh, cute little doggy. - Here you go. - Argh! He's gonna eat a flummel. You monster. We won't let you die, brother. I'm not getting a pulse. Argh! Guys, guys, guys, it's just a doughnut. Food, refined sugar, trans fats. I have to admit, we're pretty delicious. Mmm! Um, right. Yeah. I imagine you guys have a few questions. Yeah. Like, where are we? You should probably ask, "When are we?" - No. We're gonna stick with where are we. - Yeah. Where? Seriously, you should ask when. Seriously. - No, where. - Yeah, I'm good with where. Er, this will take some visual aid. Oh, I know just the place to get you some answers. Follow me. Yeah. This way. Oh! Ed, stop. I don't know what these are but I finally feel like we belong to something. Whoa! This place is kind of spooky. Ugh! It makes my skin crawl. No offence. No! Stay with the group. - Us's. - Ah! What are we looking at here? - We found us's. Flummels. - Oh! And, as usual, they're ignoring us. Hey. It's Charlie. What's up? Oh. Oh! Ooh! Oh! Oh! - So, what's going on here? - Guys, guys, relax. They're just models. Fakes. This is the Hall of Extinct Creatures. OK. I mean, the Hall of Extinct Creatures. What does extinct mean? I have no idea. I just joined. Well, you see it began with... I guess I could... Oh, you know what? I'll just let this thing do it. Flummels, The Whole Story. A ship cuts across the sea toward destinies unknown. That's the thing I saw before we fell into the flower. We are the Beagle of His Majesty's royal fleet. That's Charles Darwin, author of On the Origin of Species. Well, not yet. Right now, I'm studying the Galapagos where I've just discovered a previously unknown island. - Home. - Home. Unfortunately, the island volcano erupted before they got there. - No home?-No home? - All that was left was a single sliver of beach. That's not even the best part of the beach. On the island, Darwin discovered the remains of an unusual ring-shaped animal he called Flummelios hidella or flummels. He theorised that the entire flummel species was destroyed by the volcano. Flummelios hidella was no more. Dead. Gone. Finished. Extinct. Extinct? Do you mean...? Oh! Ugh! Wait. All the flummels gone? How did this happen? It doesn't make any sense. Everyone was just fine. We were just there. Unless we weren't just there. - OK, Clarance, I'll ask. - What? When are we? So, we're in the future in a place called Shanghai and all of the other flummels are gone? - No more Jepson? - No more little Bo. No more that guy whose name we don't know. Normally, I'd be excited that we just rhymed. Don't worry. Well, worry a little, but either way, stick with the dog. Oh! That's Sun, Dr Chung's wife. Nice lady. Really knows how to scratch a tummy. Dr Chung discovered these flowers and used them to travel through time before he got lost somehow, somewhere. Anyway, the answer to all your problems is right through here. - So, come on. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm not going through that thing again. What if we end up Dr Chunged? Hey, you're in good hands. OK. Paws, but front paws, get it? Thanks to me, Sun hasn't even noticed that Dr Chung is missing. - Huh! I'm convinced. Let's go. - Whoa! Whoa! - Ugh! - Ohhh! Huh? Welcome to the time terminal, terminal, terminal, terminal, terminal. A place neither in the past nor the future. Dr Chung discovered that each one of these portals leads to a different time flower somewhere in history. Allow me to demonstrate. Let's try this one. Austria, 1787. That's Mozart. The musical genius. Now, check this out. Was ist das? And now he's just showing off. All we have to do is find the seed that activates the Galapagos portal - and you'll be on your way home. - Home? To a volcanic explosion? No, home before the volcanic explosion, so we can warn everyone. Warn them? How are the flummels gonna trust us with their lives when they don't even trust us with their flowers? Remember when I told you to look to the future? This is that future because we're the only ones who can save the flummels from extinction. So, forget fitting in. We're gonna stand out as heroes. OK. OK. But if we're gonna do this, we have to do it right. Let's concentrate. Take our time, carefully consider our every move. - Absolutely. It's all about focus. - Ugh! Totally not this one. - Not this one or this one. - Oh! Ah! Ugh! Ah! Ugh! - You're doing it all wrong. - No, actually, I'm doing it all right. Gallipoli. Galilee. - No. - You're in the wrong. - Oh, here it is, Galapagos 1835. Listen, I'm... Well, dang. I found it. I found the seed for it. Maybe we're supposed to be extinct. Not good. Not good. Oh! Aarrgghh! Aaarrrggghhh! Ugh! Huh! Where am I? This is horrible. I've got to get out of here. Oh! And who are you? I'm Ernest Shackleton, head of the Ernest Shackleton Expedition. Now, don't worry, you're with friends, part of a team, team Ernest Shackleton, named after me, Ernest Shackleton. Good dog. Ernest Shackleton. Hello. I'm Clarance. And you are? We are only here to serve Master. OK. Maybe we'll do names later. - Whoa! - Wah! Intruders! - Sanitise them. - Argh! - Oh! - What are you two? Monsters? Space aliens? - Elvis! Are you two Elvis? - We're none of those things. We're Op and Ed, we're... They appear to be a pair of flummels, Flummelios hidella to be exact. The Germans refer to them as They all went extinct in the early 19th century. My name is Dottie. I'm a dodo bird. My anxious friend here is Burnie, he's a Tasmanian tiger. And Alma is a meridian gelada. Meriged...? Just Alma. It's fine. Who are these guys? They're new and small and new. New guys. And this is Hoss. He's from the Cretaceous period, so he's millions of years old but also he's only five. - Are these new extinctables? - What are extinctables? - We are, mate. - We'd be happy to tell you all about everything. We have a nice glossy brochure or we could sing a song. - Brochure sounds great. - Brochure. - Song it is. ♪ So you're wondering what it means to be an extinctable... - Yes. - ♪ Well, I'm afraid the answer starts with the unthinkable ♪ Years ago, we almost died but lucky for us Dr Chung arrived ♪ He brought us here where it's safe and warm ♪ And sheltered us from major storm... - I think she means extinction. - Probably. ♪ Now we call this strange place home ♪ And honestly prefer not to roam ♪ We know staying here feels like a crime ♪ When we could explore any place in time ♪ Like 4 BC or NYC, Tokyo ♪ Greece or the Pyrenees ♪ Maybe visit Pompeii before it went to rubble ♪ Nope, those places aren't worth the trouble ♪ For the world's full of danger and life is unfair ♪ So you can kill time here ♪ Or time will kill you out there ♪ There's plague and famine, germs by the pound ♪ Virus and disease, no cure to be found ♪ There's wars and swords and tyrants abound ♪ Aliens, Bigfoot, the Earth isn't round... Burnie. ♪ Get crushed, blown up or fall deathly ill ♪ Or stay safe here where time stands still ♪ For the world's full of danger and life is unfair ♪ So you can kill time here ♪ Or time will kill you out there ♪ The bulldog rat, the Aztec cat ♪ Giant goose and the great stag moose, the large sloth lemur ♪ The Pleistocene beaver, the Russian retriever ♪ Guys, I wish you could've seen it because no matter the name ♪ They're all out of the game ♪ It's a Japanese sea lion crying shame ♪ It could happen any year in any hemisphere ♪ If you wanna stay safe best stay right here ♪ For the world's full of danger and life is unfair ♪ You can kill time here or ♪ Time can kill you out there. ♪ Wow. That wasn't terrible. You know, I feel Clarance would've really gotten a kick out of that. Wait? Clarance, Clarance? Clarance, Clarance, Clarance? What did you do? It all happened so fast. Er, the portals just went crazy and then Clarance flew away, like dogs do. This is a new record, Op. We've been here all of ten minutes - and everybody already hates us. - Oh, hate is a strong word. It's fine. It'll all be fine. Ed and I will get Clarance and the seed back. I hate to break it to you but there's no telling where - or when Clarance might be. - Not to mention, he may be taken by body snatchers, boogeymen, Cyclopses. Burnie. The point is, Clarance could be anywhere literally. Well, not anywhere. Doesn't he have to be in one of those places? Let me get this straight. You're suggesting you randomly journey to these dozens of unknown and dangerous places in hopes of stumbling across Clarance by sheer dumb luck? Sounds like a plan to me. Let's go find that dog. Wait. Did she say dangerous? Did you say dangerous? Dangerous is just another word for heroic. Well, they're dead. Oh! - Huh? - Hello, sir. Have you seen a cute little doggy around here? - Really fluffy, about yay high. - Ugh! - Oh! - Oh! Ugh! Ugh! - Argh! - No! Argh! Ohhh! Okey-doke. We're done here. - Crikey! You're not dead. - Pay up. No sign of Clarance and we almost got killed. This is why I don't like to travel. Come on, Ed. We've got a lot more places to check, - so let's not get distracted. - Oh! - My face. - Ugh! Hey. Oh, look it's me. Hi, me. Oh, no. There's a hole right through me. Just messing. I know that's how I look. Wow! Your sister really is... Bound to be the eventual death of me? I was going to say energetic. OK, Ed? I've got a great feeling about this next portal. - Do you trust me? - No. Huh! Ssh. Ah-ha. Oh! - Ha! That lady really didn't like us trying on her hat. - You think? Wow! Cleopatra's crown. History must be a non-stop adventure. What's it like out there? It's amazing. Each place is more exciting than the last. - And more dangerous. - Listen to this one, Hoss. As I've told you before, you do not want to leave here where it's safe. And, Op, he's just a kid. You should stop putting ideas in his head. But I want ideas in my head. I'm so cooped up in here. I know what will knock the glum right out of ya. Live from inside Dr Chung's mobile greenhouse, it's Burnie, the Down-Under-Wonder. - Yeah. - We got great seats. First, I'll need a common household item. Now, I place the object between the two time flowers and utter the magic words, presto-change-o-koala-dingo. Ooh! Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Easy, jumbo. It'll be back in three, - two, one, and... - Oh! - How did you do that? - A magician never reveals his secrets. The merging of two time flowers causes an extremely powerful arc that disassembles the atoms of an item, sends them into a time loop, then reassembles the item at a different point in time. Magic. Thank you. What? What? What is it? No worries. Hey, you two, wake up. We only wake for Master. All we do, we do for Master. Right, right. Master. Well, I think I heard Master say you two should snap my leash so I can go free. As Master wishes. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. The Master says stop. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh! This did not go how I hoped. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Clarance, where are you. - I don't see him, Op. Me neither. Whoa! But I do see a pretty good wall. On second thought, a great wall. Whoa. What are they? - They're sky flowers. - Wow! - Whoa. - Imagine if we brought these back to the flummels. - Ha! - Hey, you're smiling. You're actually enjoying yourself. Um, no, I'm not. We have a lot of mess ahead of us and you keep making the mess messier. You are a mess-maker. Oh! I know. I'm sorry. Ugh. What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you. You just don't think things through. I mean, we've been lucky so far but, one of these days, you're gonna get someone hurt, me probably. You're right but I'm gonna be better. From now on, we don't do anything unless we're both on board. Mm-hmm. You promise? - I promise. - OK. OK. I'll hold you to that. You know, this is nice. Finally, a chance to relax. - Argh! - Spoke too soon. - Argh! - Argh! - Whoa! - Whoa! It's been a while. You do think they're OK out there? I'm sure they're fine. Oh! Oh! Oh! You're alive. Barely. Those sky flowers tried to kill us. These are fireworks. The Chinese invented them. They also invented the gunpowder inside them. They came from the Qianlong coronation. You must've been in China, 1736. So, where are you two going next? How about this one? - If that's the one you want, then I love it. - Thank you. Let's hope it's the right one for the flummels' sake. They have no idea our entire species is doomed. Argh! We're doomed. - We've lost our DJ. Where's Vinny? - Hey, dudes. - Sorry I'm late. - Oh, crisis averted. Oh! My face. - Clarance. - Ssh! Clarance. I can't believe you guys found me. You're better explorers than this Shackleton guy. Ernest Shackleton. Ugg! Oh! You'll be happy to know I kept this safe. There's just one small problem. - Hmm. I see. - I have a plan. - Op has a plan. - Good. What's the plan? Yeah. What's the plan? And she's gone. - Did she just abandon us? - No, no, no. She wouldn't abandon us. We just talked about this. And Op just promised me she wouldn't do this kind of thing any more. So, no. She'll be back. She's probably just gonna just... OK. She might have abandoned us. Ugh! Ugh! Op runs off and I'm left pounding a rock. Oh, I should have known. What's this doing here? - Oh, no. - To the rescue. He's coming for the toy. Everything's cold. This is fun. Op, what are you doing? Hoss, see that shiny necklace on Clarance? Bite it. You broke Master's chain. No-one betrays Master. - Whoa! - Er, this isn't fun any more. We gotta run. Let's go, Hoss. Whoa! - Whoa! Clarance, no! - The seed! We can't get home without that seed. Hoss, circle back around. No. It's too dangerous. - I'm scared. - Turn around, Hoss, now. - Whoa! - I got you. Oh! Come on. - Got it. Back into the time flower, Hoss, and step on it. - Oh. Oh! Almost there. Ow! Aarrgghh! Do you know how to play this game? We're playing a game? Hey. Have you guys seen Hoss? Ugh! Aegh! - Oh! It's Clarance. - Clarance. You may wanna move. - Argh! - Ugh! Ugh!- Was ist das? Nein. Nein. Oh, oh! Oh! OK. We got Clarance. We got the seed. We... Oh, no. - Are you OK, Hoss? - No, he's not OK. You almost got him extinct. Not to mention the rest of us. - But I didn't think... - That's right. You didn't think and you didn't listen, even though you looked me in the eye and promised me that you wouldn't do anything unless we were both on board. All this time, I thought I never fit in with the flummels because there was something wrong with me. But now it's clear, it's you. What...? What are you saying? I'm saying that my life would be better off without you. Hey. Hey, he'll be OK. I'm sure he just needs some time to cool off. - What are you doing? - Ed's right. I am the problem. And he is better off without me. All of you are. But there's one thing I can still do. I'm going back to warn the flummels. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not sure you should go without Ed. I just end up causing him more trouble and I've caused him enough trouble already. If I can pull this off, then Ed will have a community to go home to. And, if I fail, well, at least I can't hurt him again. The seed, if you please. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Come on. Ugh! Hmm! This is not good. You know, you're also a great leader on the dance floor. Thanks, Mali. You've said that about five times already. What is she doing here? Hello-ah! Little reminder. This is the flower festival. Second reminder, you've been banned from the flower festival. I don't have time for the whole story but I need everyone's attention. Hey! Do you mind? I am trying to get my kids to sleep in here. Oh, now I'm up all night. Thanks. I just returned from the future and I learned that in the past, and by the past I mean now, our entire species is about to stop existing. So, if we're going to live to see the future, we have to do something now, which is in the past. I'm sorry. What? We're all about to go extinct. That means die. Argh! No. Easy. Easy. It's all right. Everyone, I promise you. Op, you're being ridiculous. That's why I made this face because you're ridiculous. I'm telling you, it's true. I swear on this conch. No, no. Don't drag me into this. Look, here's proof I was in the future. Booby! Hey, what about this? Friend, friend, friend, friend. Hm! - Why did I think this would work? - Argh! Wow! You really let her have it. Remind me to never get on your bad side. But don't you think you were maybe a little bit hard on her? She is your sister after all. No. It's been like this our whole lives. Maybe I shouldn't have said it out loud. But it's true. My life would be much better without her. Oh, Ed, don't say that. This is a place of withouts. We all live here without our families, without friends. Sometimes, I think without really living at all. But I can tell you this, life is really tough when you're all by yourself. I know that's how I look. Hey, Ed, Ed, are you seeing this? Ugh! Oh! Could someone give me a hand with this? Anyone? Booby. Hey, check it out. I'm the friend at the end. Hey, I don't care. Oh! Oh, Wally. Wally? Hey, Wally. Get over here, buddy. Wally, where are you going? Ed? Ed? Ed? You OK? I have to talk to Op. Op? Op? Op? Op! Hey, Ed, check this out? You wanna sign my cast? I wanted to ask Op if she'd sign it too but she left in kind of a hurry. She left? Left where? I think she said something about going home. Going home? Ha? Ha? Ha? Ah? Ugh! Argh! Argh! Argh! Argh! OK. Very interesting presentation. - Ooh! - Gave is a lot to think about. But, let's be honest, truthful, real truthful, - you never went to the future. - Yes, she did. - Huh? - Huh? - And I can attest to it. - What is that thing? - I don't know but sick do. The name is Clarance. I'm a dog, part poodle, part... It's hard to know. My mother was very social. You came. You've gotta tell the flummels they're in trouble. Oh, they most certainly are in trouble... from me. Huh? Hey, wait, where are you going? Huh? Argh! OK. So, she might have been telling the truth. Ugh! Oh! Ahhh! Argh! Hiya. Why did you do that? And why did you do this? Because I hate you. I hate all flummels. Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. Flummels ruined my life. I was a puppy once, adorable and spunky, just waiting for a family to take me home. But, unfortunately, I lived in a world of flummels. And flummels were the most popular pet in the world. Everyone wanted those stupid roundos. "Oh, they're cute. I can see through you." I get it. Nobody wanted a dog with a stomach. But then, one day, my luck changed. He's perfect. I'll take him. I couldn't believe it. This man wanted me. And he even loved me enough to give me a name. You're coming home with me, Clarance. I was expecting a warm bed and a fresh pile of newspapers. - Sit. - But instead, I got something better. - Good boy. It was then that I realised I was more than just a pet. I was a part of science. It's the top of the fifth inning as The Bambino steps to the plate. He's calling a home-run shot. He's pointing to a dog on a tiny little car. Oh, Doctor, I don't believe it. It worked. Now, let's go together. I loved that man. I finally felt I belonged somewhere, right by his side, adventuring through time and history together. But then, one day, we travelled to 1835, to this island. And there we found a bunch of these stupid napkin rings. - Huh? - Huh? Dr Chung told me this was when Darwin first discovered flummels and introduced them to the rest of the world. Oh, my goodness, look at you. Isn't she cute, Clarance? He loved them. He was gonna love flummels more than me. And then it hit me. I didn't have to accept the course of history, I could change it. I think we're all set. Ready for our next adventure, Clarance? Clarance? Ugh! Help me. Argh! Yeah, that's right. I turned on my master. I'm a bad guy. That's what we do. I pushed him though a portal and made sure he could never come back. After that, there was nothing stopping me from coming back here and destroying your entire species. It wasn't a volcano, it was me. Mass explosive device activated. Now, back to some smooth jazz. It was a quick trip but I got a lot done that day. Three, two, one. Zero flummels. Mission accomplished. And it was all a done deal until you two hula-hoops showed up. But it's all about to be fixed because your brother is back with the other cowards who never leave their precious little time terminal. And you're not getting off this island alive. Flummel extinction in 30 minutes. 30 minutes? That's more time than I thought. - It's not a lot of time but... - Yeah. I meant to only set it for three, these stupid clumsy paws. You know what? It don't matter. You've got a front row seat to your species and your own extinction. - Ta-ta. - Hm! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ooh! Ah-ah! She's too funny to stay mad at. Look, look. I found Dr Chung. - Huh? - What? I just returned with the last Tasmanian tiger on Earth. It scratched me up pretty good. What? I don't get into cars with strangers. And we're recording. Inventor log, June 20th. That's the day he went missing. Today, I'm visiting one of my heroes, the great explorer, Zheng He. He created one of the first nautical maps ever. Who knows? Maybe I'll even get to see him drawing it up. Now, off to 1417. - 1417, he said 1417. - OK. - We know where he went now. Ready for your next adventure, Clarance? Clarance? Ugh! Help me! Argh! Clarance did that? What kind of conspiracy nut am I if I didn't see that coming? But we could still save Dr Chung if we just use whatever seeds... - Or not. - Oh! I can't believe we finally know where Dr Chung is - and there's no way to bring him back. - Unless... Ah-ha! 1418. No, no. Dr Chung said he was going to 1417, remember? Yes. To visit Zheng He, which means he probably joined his expedition to Malacca, 1418, where there's another time flower. We just need some sort of beacon to lead him to it. Sure, but what? - Perfect. - We should also give him the brochure. - Ed? - Op, I'm so sorry - I didn't mean... - Flummel extinction in 15 minutes. Wait, what's that thing? Huh? Huh? What's going on? A volcano didn't make us extinct. Clarance did with that bomb and now he's trapped the others in the cave and he trapped me against this tree and... Well, it's all over. No, it's not over because we both didn't agree that it is. I was so wrong to say what I said and I want you to know that I didn't mean it. All you've ever done is support me and my life would be nothing without you. What are you talking about? I can't do anything right. You know it. I know it. The rest of the flummels certainly know it and... Who cares what the flummels think? I'm serious. I've spent so long worried about fitting in with all the other flummels that I never even noticed this is where I fit in best, right here with you. Come on, I screw up all the time. But if it weren't for your screw-ups, then we would've never even fallen through that flower. And, thanks to you, we have a chance to rescue our species from extinction. So, what now? I'll tell you what now. We're gonna save the flummels because they'd do the same thing for us if it was the other way around. Probably. You think you can get me out of this thing? No problem. There's only a million combinations here. Nope. Nope. Nope. Thanks, guys. Next time I poke you, it's gonna be a lot softer. Come on, Op, we're not gonna let that adorable maniac get away with this. Hello? Yoo-hoo. Huh? Huh? What the...? Oh, no, no, no, it can't be. Argh! Huh? Oh! Why won't these flummels just die? Looks like I may need some help. Big help. Ugh! Ugh! How much time before the bomb goes off? Flummel extinction in nine minutes. I know it wants to kill us but you have to admit it is helpful. Don't worry. You'll be long gone by then. What are you gonna do, fuzz ball? There's only one you and two us's. Funny you should mention that. What is that? Meet my Cyclops. And in case you were wondering if ancient Greek monsters were real, they were. OK, Greg, you know what to do. Whoa! - Oh. - Oh. - Ohhh! - Argh! - Hmm? Huh? Oh! Ugh! Extinctables, ready for action. Burnie. Hoss. Ugh! Alma. And Dottie. I just drove for the first time and, so far, I've only hit one pedestrian. - Guys. - You left the terminal. The best decision I've made in a long time. Or the worst decision. - Everybody, back in the truck. - I told you there were Cyclopses. - Ugh! - Lose him. He's following us. Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! - Oh! - Ugh! Crikey! That one eye makes for pretty poor depth perception. He couldn't hit the broadside of a Hoss. - No offence, Hoss. - None taken. You're right. Follow my lead. - Hey, Cyclops, bet you can't hit me. - Hmm? - Bet you can't hit me. Need a target? Hundred points if you get it through the bull's-eye. - Hey, put some sauce on that meatball.-Yeah! - Yeah! - Hmm? - I'm talking to you, Cyclops. - Hey! Noodle arms, noodley, noodley. Ugh! Ugh! Argh! - Ooh-ee! Ugh! Ugh! - No, Greg. - It's working. - Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! - Wahhhh! - Na-na-na-na!- Blblblblblblblblblblb! Ugh! No, stop. You one-eyed idiot. Ugh! Ugh! Hmm? - Ohhh! - Argh! I hate you all... He is a very, very, very ugly wet-looking dog. So I spent a lot of my cave time thinking about you two and what I would do if we ever got out of there alive. I settled on this. Ugh! Ah! You think maybe we could do this later? The whole island is about to blow up. Correct. Flummel extinction in seven minutes. What do we do, Jepson? The only thing we can do, we ask Op and Ed and then we do whatever they say. Ed, what do you think? Er, well, um... Oh! The ship. That's Charles Darwin, the man from the museum movie. If we make it to the beach, he might be able to save us. - Movie? - Man? Save? Wait, I know what that means and it's good. But what are those? Jepson, meet the extinctables. Welcome. Is something wrong with them? They don't have any holes. Stay, Hoss, sit. Jepson, you get everyone to the beach. We'll meet you down there after we get this Darwin guy's attention with the sky flowers. - Sky flowers? - Hit it, Burnie. All right. Go, go, go. Whoa! Er, but these flummels haven't been sanitised. - No time, just go. Hi-yah. - Oh, this is my nightmare. Wait. I just wanna say thanks for everything and try not to fall to your death. Of course not. What do you think I am, a dodo? Didgeridoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Whoa! - Ooh! - Oh, because they look like flowers in the sky. Hey, tell whoever came up with that name, great job. What in blazes? My goodness! So many magnificent creatures. Can we go? Please, please, please, please, please. - Oh! Fine. But this is the last island. - Yippee. He sees us! Op and Ed did it. Whoa! That felt weird to say. Uh-oh. Ah, now, that's the Op and Ed I know. Oops! Yeah, who'd have thought our aim would be too good? Ugh! Ugh! Eeerrgghh! - Ugh-ugh! - Hey, there, big fella. You don't wanna eat us. Just eat me, let Ed live. - Mmm! Hmmm? - That's nice what you said out there, - you know, outside of the mouth. - I meant it. I hope he swallows me first just so you can live a little longer. I hope he swallows me first. I don't wanna see you swallowed. - Ed! - Oh, Op! We're alive and smell like Cyclops' breath. - Behind that big eye there's an even bigger heart. - Oh! - And by the way, you have a cavity. - Op, I don't think that ship is gonna get here in time to save us. - I've got an idea. - I knew you would. So the Cyclops will throw us to the time flower, we'll take it to the beach and we'll take everyone through it - before the bomb goes off. - Right. Great repeating the plan, Ed. - Hmmmm! - Hey, you can do it, big guy. We believe in you. Uh-hmm. - Ugh! - Wait, wait, wait. - Hmm? Maybe try throwing underhand. Ah! Ugh! Whoa! - Ohhhh! - Oh! - Ugh! - Ugh! - Oh! - Ugh! Whoa! Argh! Argh! Whoa! - Ugh! - Oh! - Ah! - Ah! Nice aim, Greg, you're a natural. Whoo! Ugh! Oh! Hmm. Booby. - Most remarkable. - Hmm. If I didn't know any better, I'd say these creatures - are trying to communicate with us. - Perhaps they're adapting to the changes around them in order to survive, almost as if they're, I don't know, evolving or something. That's rubbish. Evolving. This way. Drop it, fruit loops. This island's about to blow and there's only gonna be one survivor and that's me. So hand over that time flower. I said hand it over. - Op Hop. - Hey. Oh! Son of a... - Nice Op Hop. - I learned from the best. Get back here. Whoa. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Ugh! Oh, oh, oh! Argh! Whoa! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Argh! Whoa! Ohhh! Argh! Op, look. It's the beach. Argh! Dang! I always forget about this cliff. End of the line, zeros. Ugh! Now hand over that flower. - I'm out of ideas. - Huh? I might have one and it's kind of an Op idea. Huh? Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Ugh! Oh! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Ow! - Ugh! - Ooh! Are you crazy? You almost got us killed, Ed. Whoa! Is this how I make you feel all the time? - Pretty much. - I am so sorry. Forget it. Now, time flowers. Time flowers? How many times did you hit your head on the way down? Five or six. Ah-ha! OK. Great. Now we have three time flowers. What good does...? Burnie's trick. Yoo-hoo! Flummel extinction in two minutes. - Would you shut up? - Shutting up initiated. - Shutting up in four minutes. - Nnnggghhh! - They're not gonna make it. - Neither are we. OK, Ed. Try something else. Something other than lighting a boat on fire. - Do you think this will work? - I have no idea. - No! Stop! - Flummel extinction in 30 seconds. I've got to get this bomb away from me. Argh! No, go up. Up! No! - Presto. - Change-o. Koala-dingo. - Nine, eight, seven... - Whoa! - ..six... - Argh!-..five... - Ugh! - ..four, three..-Oh! - ..two one. - Oh! Booby. Argh! King's casserole. Majesty's meatloaf. You know, nearly 200 years ago, my great-great-grandfather sailed here with the one and only Charles Darwin. He claimed that there was an island here that exploded and completely vanished. Yeah. I think I had a relative that did something like that too. - King's casserole. - Majesty's meatloaf. Oh! We're alive? Oh, or at least I'm alive. Ed, you alive? I think so. What about everyone else? - Ed? - Dottie? - Ed. Ed. - Dottie. Oh! Hoss and everybody! You're alive. You're all alive. We're saved. Yes, thanks to Op and Ed, we are de-extincted. I assume that's a word. So, were you worried about me? Maybe just a little. Ohhh! Er... Huh? Hey, I'm uncomfortable. You did it. What exactly did you do? Burnie's trick on a grand scale. We used every time flower we could find to make the whole island disappear before the bomb went off. My trick? I was right about the flowers and the Cyclops. What else am I right about? Oh, this is terrifying. This isn't over. Booby. I'll just get back in that flower and I'll keep trying again and again until you're all extinct. - Sit! - Sitting. It worked. Dr Chung made it back. You've been a very bad dog, Clarance. - Oh, I haven't started. - Lay down. - When I'm done... - Beg. - ..you'll feel the wrath of my... Play dead. Cursed by obedience. Flummelios hidella. As adorable as ever. And my extinctables? Oh, it's so good to see you and you and you and... you? Ooh! When are we? I think you should be asking when are... No, wait. You got it. Today, we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the greatest discovery of the 21st century, a species once thought extinct, flummels. Yes, huggable, lovable, adorable flummels brought to us by famed botanical astrophysicist Dr Lee Chung. I'm so proud of you, Lee. And you've been so much more talkative since your discovery. Oh! Ooh! And she's back. How you been, sis? Hey, look at you. Friend at the end again, eh? Nope. Fellow at the front. Aww! And all without my help. You and Dr Chung visit any cool places lately? You bet we have. It's been one amazing adventure after another. What did you guys end up doing with Clarance? Oh, he's cooling off. No dog should have a master, so on the count of three, I say we tie up Shackleton, take his ship and head somewhere warm like Cabo. OK. OK. We can change it up. Fiji? San Diego? Rome? Paris? They let dogs into restaurants there! Argh! Ready or not, Hoss. Here I come. Great job, everyone. And thanks for helping out, pals. Hey, Op and Ed. Well, how do you like this year's two-flower floats? - Great. - I look a little chunky. I'm sorry your teeth are yellow. We ran out of white flowers. - Hmm! - Hey, Ed, I have a little surprise for you. - Come with me. - Oh, yeah, I love surprises. Except I just remembered that I don't. So tell me what it is so I'm not too surprised. What? Ha! Oh, God. Ohhh! Don't worry, Ed. I'm sure you have plenty of time to prepare for... Op, I really don't know if I could handle another surprise today. Trust me, you're gonna love it. Hey, I haven't seen you since, what, like 1835? There's so much to talk about. You two keep going. I'll go get him a glass of water.
