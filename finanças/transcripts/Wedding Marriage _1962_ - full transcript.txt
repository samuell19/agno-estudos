This movie received the First Prize in the Ethnographic Film Festival Silver Medal in Cannes Film Festival 1962 On the bank of a river, a young girl, Maryam, was washing her clothes. Accidentally, she let a handkerchief go. It began to drift away. Rinsing another cloth, she saw the handkerchief. Will she go after it? No! She is afraid. Luckily, two you men were nearby. One of them, Garba, dived and brought the handkerchief back. This was the opening scene that led them to meet. But the man had to go back to work and had no choice but to leave. Everyday, Garba was fishing. One day, on his way, he met a child to whom he used to tell stories. Casting a glance here and there, he saw a girl faraway. She were Maryam. He waved and moved closer to her. "Ah! What a nice surprise!", Garba said. Yes, absolutely. Where were you going? I was looking for you. With fish traps? Then they engaged in serious talk. But before he left, Garba begged Maryam to meet him again. That's how they agreed on a rendez-vous on the riverbank. Garba was very happy for this promise. It was unexpected but wished for. He jumped and danced! What good fishing! Later, at sunset, the two friends met on the riverbank. Garba was wearing his most beautiful clothes. The most beautiful gift for Maryam, as a wedding promise, was a pair of shoes. Before they parted, Garba said to Maryam that he would tell his parents about their decision. Home, Garba told his father "I'm in love with a girl." "I love her and she loves me." But marriage is of great importance in our country. It involves the participation of the boy's family. And the girl's family too. That's the reason why his elder sister sent griots, spokesmen of African villages. Sitting on the village's bridge, the boy told the girl... "Maryam, I told my parents about you." "I think they will send griots to ask for your hand tomorrow." Maryam was very happy. On that bridge, they will spend the whole night wondering about their future. The griots were now ready to go. On their way, they are always asked to answer some questions. They never stop talking. "What are you here for?", asked Maryam's uncle. "Something very serious." "We came to ask for your daughter's hand." "In the name of Garba, son of Daerou the fisherman." For a long time, the parents of the girl consider the question. Home, Garba is longing for the answer. He's coming and going. Maryam is hiding behind the mat. She's carefully listening to her uncle's words. The griots smilingly came back to Daerou. An agreement was made. Garba's elder sister let him know. "Tomorrow, you can go to your in-laws and thank them." The next day, Garba, accompanied by his friends, went to thank the girl's parents for the agreement that was made. The agreement allowed him to come each evening to his in-laws' house without any problem. In a refitted part of the yard they kept chatting. Time was flying by. Before he left, Garba gave a little gift to the girl. Home, Daerou was already paying the dowry. For a young girl, it usually costs between 25.000 and 30.000 Francs. The money is counted by several people. Then given to the spokesman. Only then is the dowry given to Maryam's uncle. Maryam's uncle receives the dowry in front of witnesses. Two months passed. The season changed. This finally is the wedding day. Men, women, children and marabous, they all gathered in front of Maryam's family's spokesman. The betrotheds' presence is not required. Marriage is an important ceremony for the Nigerien. Sheep are killed to make a feast. The marabous receive presents. After a few Koranic verses, the marriage is celebrated. The griots, idlers of the society, never miss such festivities. Some young girls are playing drums and others are clapping. The atmosphere is filled with ululations. Standing in the middle of the circle, the newlywed must prove to the griot how esteemed he is by receiving on his head gifts from his friends and family. The same goes for the young girl. The ceremony lasts for 7 days. 4 at the bride's parents', 3 at the groom's parents'. People dance until daybreak. Maryam receives the last advice from her parents.
