What is it dear? What is this noise? What happened? If only I could catch this crazy courtier's cats. Has she teased sister Mahmure again? You gang of tramps. I'll complain about you to the landlord... ...all of you. She is living in the mansion for free... and disturbing the neighborhood. Keep your cats under control. Keep them under control! ...it almost ate sister Mahmure. Well a hundred scabby birds should be sacrificed for my Lion coral. My tabby, my silver, my meow, my Arabian, my blue eyes, my cotton... they are all cats from the palace. They will have upset stomachs if they eat this scab. - She called sister Mahmure scab. - You are the scab. They undoubtedly call me courteous Sehnaz. I grew up under Seraskier Ali Pasha's care. There were 20 servants like these at my door. Odalisques, gardeners, cooks, maids... I used to lead a comfortable life. Friends! Am I the sort of woman to be scolded by such tramps? Uncle Bahattin what kind of a nuts woman is this? She got the whelps on her... ...lap, keeps on calling them courteous cats. My lion put your arm a bit forward so your rank is visible.

Come on Timuçin. Brother Murat! Brother Murat! Brother Murat! Brother Murat! We caught a half gold fish! Where on earth did it come from? Have you invented a Money machine? They call this genuine money! This is a pure five liras! Smells beautiful, blessed, beautiful. - Whats it, have you won the lottery? - No, come on, no. - Have you taken up jugglery? - This is lottery of honesty. While a man was looking at the atom bomb dropped his wallet. And I gave him the wallet. Then he gave me 5 liras. Are you crazy? You are talking nonsense. What the hell the Atom bomb has to do here? Are we in Japan? No uncle Ahdin, I tried to mean woman like a book. Oh my dear five liras, now we'll have the noodle soup for tonight. Come on I'll offer you all lea. - You're lucky old chap. - Old chap is your father. - Isn't this less? - No even more. This watch doesn't even worth 2,5 liras but just for my respect for you I'll give it. If the little one was not waiting at the beach I wouldn't give this watch for this amount. But if you don't bring the money next week, know that your watch will be gone. - Ali. - Cool it. Add our teas to Selman Effendi's tab. Thank god for... ...getting over with this much. This watch is worth at least a hundred. - Ali. - Cool it. Tell master Hakkl, to brew three cup of teas for us. - Certainly. So three cups of tea? Mistik offers three cups of tea. So now Mistik is rich. Maybe he found a treasure. Look he's a dynamic young man, he has the stature. - Maybe he's sponging on a woman. - You think he's a gigolo? Whatever you say, goes in from here and out from there, tell your problem to this five liras big as a sheet. There's two from before but if you want keep it for the evening, we'll be even - ...if you clean the windows in the evening. - Ok deal. - What are you looking for on the floor Mistik? - I've lost my mind of course I'm looking for it. Come on find it quick and pick yourself up, or noodles will become soup in my pocket. - Ali. - Cool it. - Ok goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye brother. Oh my dear noodle soup. Do you know how we shall make the soup now? How? With eggs. When we squeeze the lemon too in the soup, it's a meal fit for a king. Do you know what I'd do if I were rich? I'd drink noodle soup 15 times a day. Bullshit! Come here. Safety pins, bodkins... We are not customers. You were asleep. - Your eyes... - Yes, I'm blind. I thought it was still day time. There is no difference between day and night if one's blind. I fell asleep. Are you hungry? Tell me, are you hungry? Come with us, let's drink a bowl of warm soup. - No I don't want. - Come on never mind. People should help each other at times like this. People don't help each other. They only think of their own benefits. Why are you talking like this? You're hungry, we're hungry too. We'll go home and cook soup. It'll be done if we add one more bowl of water for you. What is the ...benefit? We can sympathize with others. I've met two people talking like this for the first time in my life. Come on. Don't get scared of us sister. Come on. Come in please. - What is this place? - A place fit for us. - I gum it's very big. - How did you know? From the guard bars of the door. Brother, I'll light the fire and put the water for the soup. Come this way, don't be scared, walk safely. Sit here. - What is your name? - Gul. - Whats your name? - My name is Murat. And mine is Mistik, Formally Mustafa. Nice to meet you. - Where do you get the pins you are selling? - I buy them from an herbalist. I earn 5 cents for each packet. - Don't you have any relatives? - I have no one. I have a friend in Uskudar, sometimes I stay with her and sometimes... ...sleep on the street like you saw. Isn't it tough for a young and beautiful girl like you to spend the night outside? Sometimes drunkards, tramps bully me I got used to these. But when they understand that I am blind they pity me and give up. - You can stay here if you want. - I don't want to be a burden for you. I'll drink my soup and leave. You are poor too. Come on, how did you think that we are poor? The coffee table. Peddlers have this kind of coffee tables, don't they? Well... no dear... Only peddlers? I'm mm well... Artist, I don't need money and the rest. Look, I'm living in a huge mansion. Mistik is my brother. Our father is a cotton merchant in Adana, he sends us plenty of money every month. Mistik is a student, he'll be an engineer. And I paint pictures just for my pleasure. You won't be a burden, stay here as long as you want. You are really good people, So I can stay here? Now I have a home to stay in a bowl of soup to keep me warm. May God bless you. Come on never mind. - We were talking about painting. - Painting is beautiful. - How do you paint pictures? - I take the brush in my hand and do it. It cannot be that easy otherwise everyone would be artists. Of course it's not that easy, first of all the person should be noble... living comfortable, fat and happy, and rich. Brother, give the noodle. And that is not all, one needs nobility of soul. The person should have pure feelings. - Have you cleaned birds' cage? - What cage? - Do you breed birds? - No... cage, well... bird... I love birds very much. And I love to draw their pictures. Aren't they so delicate, so poetic creatures? Brother, where did you put the cabbage? Rabbit... ...rabbit, my rabbit you should see its pictures. Let me check the soup. Get going. Will you die if you just keep your mouth shut for a minute? - Come on what did I say? You almost ruined everything! Listen to me carefully! The girl wanted to go because we are poor. And I lied to her to stop her leaving. I told her that we are rich. We are brothers, our father is a merchant in Adana and sends money to us monthly. I am an artist and you are studying engineering. Don't forget this mansion is ours! Now take this soup and get going. Super! We are from a rich family! Soup is ready Gull, there you are. Mistik cooks great dishes. I'm sorry, tonight we were in a haste, he cooked the soup very quickly. Otherwise we eat delicious stuffed vegetables every day. So if you are rich then why don't you hire a servant? Who's going to deal with the servant? Two hands for one head. We don't like to show off. One should be modest. Otherwise if were to show off, our father is a millionaire in Adana. He'd buy us apartments, Cadillac brand automobiles... ...double servants, noodle soups every night if we wanted. - Whats it? What happened? - Nothing, nothing dear... ...Mistik is joking again. - He is such a joker. - I am such a joker. The craftsmen don't have any mercy. Gosh! Where did this baby come from? Come on in Monsieur Artin! We have been waiting for you. Where have you been for days? Have you lost your marbles? From our kind and dear friend Merchant Monsieur Artin. - This lady is Gull. - What a noble introduction. They have sent a note from your office, have a look at it. What are you saying? Which office? Who the hell is this gilt? Ok let me tell you all about it. We got the bread and noodle and were coming home. So you newly met with the lady? Madam I'm Turkish Photography Corporation Manager, Artin Dartanyan. I am honored madam. Ok now I have an offer guys, in honor of madam Gul's joining us... I am organizing an elaborate party for tomorrow night. All right automobiles are on me. I am out if there are automobiles, you know they make me feel sick. The best is to have a party here, just us. - I'll play harmonica for you. - And I will sing songs. You're awesome madam Gull! Anyway, we'll deal with the rest tomorrow. Gull must be sleepy now. Let's make her bed, we'll sleep in the big room. - You are going to feel uncomfortable because of me. - Come on, it is impossible to be uncomfortable... ...in this huge mansion? Besides Monsieur Artin is... ...staying too. We'll go up to the guest room. Come on Mistik. Let's make Gull's bed. Bring clean sheets. Come on quick. Sit here. Your bed is ready Gull. - Have a nice sleep. - Have a nice sleep. You too. - Aren't you eating? - I don't want to. Look Mistik, leave showing off and talking nobly to me. You know my child I talk like a dictionary. Forgive me for asking, are you underestimating me? I will adorn the living room in such a way for the banquet. I'll also buy flowers, big huge roses. Do you really think you're rich? Murat bro, is it ok if I give the rem to the girl? Ok you give the roses. - I'll give 5 liras. - No Selman Effendi I... - ...need 10 liras. - You're not a stranger. - We'll give 7,5 liras. - But... Come on, not even one cent more. - Ali. - Cool it. - Add our teas to Selman Effendi's tab. - Certainly br'er. What happened Uncle Artin? Did you catch the fish while swimming? - Go away! - What happened to your hand? - I got pricked. - These roses don't smell at all. - Don't they? - So what now? - I'll take care of that. Come on I have fragrances! Nice smelling fragrances! - Hi. - Hello. - Do you have rose oil? - I have the bat. Let me smell it. This is no good. - Whats this? - Jasmine. Let me see. I didn't like it, it smells so very obvious. - This? - That's lilac. This one's good. - What're you going to do with it? - I will spatter it on the roses. - You can't do that sir! Don't do nonsense. - Screw it... ...l can pour it where ever I want to because I'm paying for it! Don't do that sir, you can't spatter lilac on roses, people will laugh at it. They will laugh at me, not you. - Do you have Jasmine oil? - I do, how much do you want? - Give me for 5 liras if ifs good. - Certainly sir. First let me smell. What kind of a Jasmine is this? It smells like garlic. - But sir... - I definitely didn't like it. I brought these flowers for you sister Gull. Lilacs... you brought lilacs. But these are roses? Would I bring you ordinary roses? I brought you grafted roses. These are antiques. These lilac smelling roses... are found only at one single place, in huge Istanbul. Thank you very much. Thank you all very much. Shall we celebrate this joyful night in the biggest hall of the - ...mansion. - What do you say? - Good idea. - How nice. - Yes, very good idea. - Let's go then. - Is there any furniture upstairs? - No. - How can a mansion be without furniture? - So come one carry this armchair. Have a look at the grandeur of this mansion! It's awe-inspiring! Come on in. Show Gul around, I will get the beers off the fridge. There we are in the VIP lounge of the mansion. From this side the magnificent view of the Bosporus is seen. And here, in the huge frames on the walls, there are grandiose oil paintings ...inherited from grandfathers. Mistik pull that armchair there. And this one is Murat's Grand Grandfather's picture. He also has the beard which was the trend of those times. It must be very valuable. Experts pay 50 thousand liras for it but they don't sell it. Its sentimental value is priceless. Come this way. And here are the portraits of their dear mother. This one is the picture of their magnificent father. What are you waiting for guys? Come on set the table. Monsieur Artin and Mistik showed me your family pictures. - Family pictures? - Yes. It's great you have the pictures of all of your ancestors. Yes, my ancestors' pictures. Come on Gul must be hungry. Now I'll set you the most poetic of dining tables. Come, let's sit here. - What did you do today? - I sat and then I thought. - What did you think of? - I thought of you. You, you all, I thought of all of you. It's really very nice to have friends. We thought of you as well. Artin, I, Mistik. We needed a friend like you, but we hadn't known that. Loneliness, destitution is horrible. I've realized this better after I met you. Now I think, if one day we part. If you... ...leave me, I cannot bear that loneliness anymore. We will never leave you Gull. From now on we'll all be together. Oh my dear God. Photography Corporate Company Manager Monsieur Artin prepared... marvelous dishes even you cannot find on the dining tables of kings. Fire the pistol Artin, let the mountains echo. Your brother is so joyful, I love this. This is really cool, the fridge works well. Was your mother or father cook Artin? If you wanted... ...you could make people eat their fingers. Now let's pledge to the queen of our dinner's health. - Is that me? - Of course. To your health sister! - To your health and to beautiful days Gull. - To beautiful days. God bias your hands, they are very delicious. My good friends, kind people, To the health of us all, of you all! May this be our worst day! For the first time in my life, you cheered me up. You saved... ...me from my dark and horrible loneliness. And you didn't show that you pity and mercy me while you were doing all these. Words are not enough to tell you how thankful I'm. May god bless you all. I have nothing to give you apart from my love. Nothing more than the love of a blind girl. What are you saying Gul? I'm talking about the honesty, humanism you showed me. I'm telling the truth. To our friendship that will last forever. I don't want to be blind anymore! I want to see! There are kind people in this world. There is still kindness on earth. Now I want to survive from this darkness... I'm in to see you, I want to see. Don't cry Gull, don't cry. I've never known my mother. We were in izmit. My father... ...had a little shop. I think those days were not that bad. Then ...then, there was this fire. I was alone at home. Flames surrounded everywhere. I was choking, I shouted, shouted... then... ...everywhere darkened. I lost my consciousness. I opened my eyes at the hospital, I am saying opened, out of habit... ...you see they are still open but what is the use if they cannot see. Gull. This was the beginning of my misfortunes. Sometime later my father got married. My step mother didn't want a blind girl ...getting in her way. And on the streets, people used to say poor girl, little one, she is miserable... ...everyone was pitying, everyone's insincere mercy. I could not stand that for long. Ran away from home, you... know the rest. - Have you ever gone to a doctor? - Ya. - What did he say? - Maybe you will see, he said. But it needs a lot of money. Lots of money. - How much? - 800 liras. That's it? 800... - Isn't it too much money? - No... I'll write to my father to send me. I will see, really? I will see again! I will see you, the nature like I used to. I will see ...you all and everything. You'll see Gull! You'll see everything! You... ...will forget these miserable days. You'll be happy! We'll be together. I won't leave here even if you show me the door. I'll cook for you, I'll sew the splits... ...on your clothes, I'll give you every service you need. We will serve you. We'll try to make you forget... ...the miserable days you had. But one day this happiness will come to an end. It doesn't matter how much I want, you mother, father... ...maybe your fiancé or wife will lead me lo leave you. And I will be lonely again. No you won't Gull. I'll never let you go. Mistik may get married if he wants to, Artin may go too. We will... ...be together. We'll have a little house. Maybe by the sea. Colorful flowers of many kinds... flowers of laughter... ...in roses, honeysuckles, ivies. And there will be birds. Mahmure sister, cotton... ...her babies. We'll not struggle to earn a living. I'll be with you... ...all day. We'll watch the stars at night. Maybe... If you want to... I don't know how to say? I'll ask you to be my wife. Don't accept if you don't want to, It's ok. But all the same... ...I'll love you. That's right.. maybe you won't like me when you start seeing. Good morning cotton. Now go and clean uncle Artin's face. But be careful, don't get poisoned. Go away! - Wake up master ifs morning. - Ok, where's Murat? Shut up... Goodbye. You'll see we'll fix everything. Cotton will accompany you. Goodbye. Holy God! At the moment I gave up all hopes of life, you sent me... ...such good hearted people. You gave me hope and happiness and give me the light... as you have given your other subjects. Help me. Please rescue me. Please let me have my own share from life like... ...all the other people, And attain my hearts desire. Please protect him for me my dear God. Then I went to the place where he told me was a clinic. The doctor who was going to the operation was the owner of the clinic. I told about our situation, and that we're poor. He was a good man. I'd not take money but... ...money for the medicine, nurses, for food, all... ...will cost 800 liras, he said. - What? 800 liras? - He said it can't be cheaper. - Where do we find this much money. - We can ask for it from the old man. - From Selman? - We'll say we're borrowing. Everyone knows us in the neighborhood. Yes they do but a fortune teller, a shoe polisher and a photographer... ...how do we pay it then. God is great, let's ask for it. - Let's do it, We're not gonna lose anything? - Ok!, let's try for once. - Don't haste. - Why? - You ask me why? - You'll never know what he'll do. We mustn't make him angry, otherwise we'll come up empty handed. Your friends are very troubled today. They have been brooding all day. Hey pals! - Come here, let's play hearts. - Forget it now. Come on. - Hello Selman Effendi. - Hello. - We have a request from you. - What request? - For a very good purpose. - Really very good. You'll have tons of merits in god's sight. Ok tell me. We urgently need some money. So are you taking up trade? - What are you going to do with the money? - How should I say? It's a charity work. Help for a disabled person. - Is 5 liras enough? - Five? What five? Increase, increase... come on. - So how much? - 800. - Cents? - What cents? Lira. - Are you kidding my child? - No, Selman Effendi. We need 800 liras. Or are you opening a bank folks? Murat is a honest boy, he doesn't talk nonsense. You should give I think. So what? They want only 800 liras. This is good deed Selman Effendi give the money. - You'll give it, won't you? - On one condition! If you give your shoe shining set, camera and fortune box ...as pledge to Effendi. You know, I'm a businessman. - Shall we bring them? - Bring the boxes, get the money. Hey Mazhar Osman! Where're you deceased man? - Fools, they think they're open-eyed. - They are not fools they are pure bumpkins. Look at them... Shut up! Listen to me Murat, forget about them. They want to tease us. They wouldn't sympathize with the poor. Would you? Just a minute Murat! - Come on for God's sake. - Listen to me for a minute. Go away if it doesn't suit you. I don't have money. If I had, you know I'd not even think. One shall go blind if values money. But listen, for the sake of god, there's this Osman Buyukbulut: Extremely rich, Extremely polite. He's a charitable person, and he knows me well. Remember once some people stabbed Blind Nuri... ...l went to him. Thank God, he immediately accepted to help - ...and gave the money. - You are teasing me. Listen to me Murat. We're not that sort of people who would make fun of poor people. My name is Bear Recep from MevlanaKapi... ...but I'm not a bear. - I know you're a gentleman. - Stay out of this! What would you lose if you had gone? Listen, go to Emirgan and ask whomever you want to... ...They'll show you Osman Buyukbulut. He's a nice, fatherly man, tell him that "bear sent me, this is the situation”. - Hasan my son. - Yes sir. How did we get crooked Hatice's - wedding money? - from Osman Buyukbulut. What about when Drunkard Salih hit the car... - ...who gave the money for the shears? - from Osman Buyukbulut of course. Do you get it my lad? We weren't that sort of people to lead a dog's life at wretched cafes but god damn it! Would it be appropriate to go now? He's a very nice man, I told you brother. Go now; I'm sure you'll be thankful to me in the end. But look then... I'm saying you'll be thankful. Don't make me boast. All right then. But don't go today. He's not at home on Fridays. We'll first go there tomorrow. You said Osman Buyukbulut, Didn't you? Correct! Ok good bye. Gosh we have fun again tomorrow. Bear, you're a smart man. - Isn't there such a man? - Of course there is. The stingiest man of Istanbul. Not even 800 liras, he wouldn't even give his sin. Folks what do you say? Shall we go too tomorrow? That's an order from God. Who would miss this fun? I think it's done. No one would believe in that tramp. - We'll give it a try, What do we have to lose? - What if he doesn't accept? Forget it, God always helps the poor. Come on. You go too Show Gul around. Poor girl has been staying at home since the morning. And we'll go and earn a few cents. - Ok bye. - bye. Do you think they'll send it urgently? I told them to send it by telegraphic transfer. Maybe we'll get it tomorrow. I can't believe. I can't believe. - How will I pay this back to you? - What payment? Don't even mention. You are so good. Come let's sit here. - Where are we now? - At the ridges of Bebek. - Is the view beautiful? - very beautiful. I'll see those beauties soon. Tell me what I'll see those beauties soon. Tell me what ...do you see? Right across Kucuk Su, Anatolian Fortress, Kanllca Cove - ...at the far end Beykoz. - Then? Now I'm seeing the most beautiful and prettiest thing in the world. I'm seeing you Gull. I'm seeing you. Your shining hair, forehead, eyes that I would die to see seeing... I'm seeing you.

You know Murat better than me. He keeps his promises, doesn't he? Maybe they've received the money. He keeps his promises, doesn't he? Maybe they've received the money. Being such happy scares me. What if my eyes aren't healed, I wonder if he will still love me? I'm thinking that after being so close to happiness... ...l really cannot go back. Cold nights... ...parks, under the bridges. I would rather kill myself. What'll happen now? It's better to tell the truth. Won't this make her miserable? After giving her so much hope... ...killing the hopes with our own hands. ...killing the hopes with our own hands. Don't you hear, what she's saying? We have to find this money. We have to find the money. Let's sell my shoe shining set, the birds, Artin's camera... - ...wouldn't they worth 800 liras? - Would they? - ...wouldn't they worth 800 liras? - Would they? We'll go to Abdulrezzak Effendi. From whom we bought the birds. What do you say bro? He knows how much you love Sister Mahmure... ...and that you would give not 800 but even 2000 Liras to get it back ...not matter how. We'll want the money from him. Come on let's go. - Give 20 liras. - No way. - Give 20 liras. - No way. No way. I'm already sick of the ones around me. Those were the days, falconry had its reputation. Look at today... ...I'll let them all fly away. It's better to sell lemons on the streets. ...I'll let them all fly away. It's better to sell lemons on the streets. Falconry huh. - Hello uncle. - Hello. - What's it? What do you want? - We brought you sister Mahmure. - So what? - We need some money. - So what? - We need some money. We know you love Sister. I mean I'd not want to leave her. She's both our friend provides our living... ...l love her like as my own child. But there's a great ...l love her like as my own child. But there's a great ...good deed at the end. Otherwise would one sell his own child? Please? Uncle Abdulrezzak, Let sister Mahmure stay with you ...for a few days. We'll find and bring your money back. You'll give, won't you? You'll help won't you? - How much do you need? - 800 liras. 800 liras? Do you think I collect the money from the trees? Are you crazy? Come on take it. Come on go now. Come one get out I said. Please? Uncle Abdulrezzak Make a favor. I said get out now! I said get out now! Please? We'll work and pay back. Come on, come on... come one. Come on get out... Sister Mahmure! You died sister Mahmure. You were my child. I brought you up. You used to eat from my hands, now you're gone. You'll not draw fortunes, you won't give good news to anyone. You died Sister Mahmure. They killed you! Murat brother. I am fed up! Why did they make fun of us at the cafe? Why did they kick us... ...out of their house? Why did they kill Sister Mahmure? What did we do to them? What did poor Sister Mahmure do? No more begging, pleading from now on. Now ifs time to want... ...and take by force. Murat brother. You stay with sister Gull. What do you want? - Where are you going? - Don't move! Take anything you want. But don't kill me. Keep you damn life to yourself! And your damn money! You'll take Gull to the clinic tomorrow. I took it by force. You'll take the girl to the clinic and take car of her. - What about you? - I'll surrender. We'll surrender. Is it you Murat? - We got the money Gul. - Have you? I can't believe! I can't believe! So you got the money. Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital. My eyes will see. Yes Gull, your dark world will be brightened up. You'll start a new life. You'll have a whole new world. No Murat. I don't have my own world. We have a world from now on. A world full of Mistikli, Monsieur Artin, a bright world. What if there wasn't us? I don't want a world without you. What would I do with the bright world if I'm lonely? You won't be lonely Gull. There are other people in the world. People as good as us. But I want you! You must understand Gul. This is life. Think about it, if fate separates us... Stop Murat! I'll die then. You'll live Gul, You'll be happy. - Without you? - Even without me. But I dreamt of such a different world. I made up a world in my dreams. A bright world. A world brightened by you. You ruined my dreams Murat. You put off the light of my dark days. - I love you Gul. - No. You were pitying me Murat, Like the others. Now that I'll see and I don't have anything to pity... ...you are leaving me. Listen to me Gull, listen whole heartedly. I love you. But there's an issue and I can't explain it to you. Let my eyes don't see again, but let me be with you. You'll see again Gul! We have many years ahead of us. I'll come back to you. I swear, we'll be happy again. I'll find you where ever you are. - Murat. - I've to go. This is worse than death for me. But I've to go Gull. I'll wait for you until I die. I'll come back Gul, doesn't matter you're at the other end of the world... ...I'll find you. Murat! Gull. Murat. My Murat. Darling... It's time Gull. Good bye sister Gull. - Are you going too Mistik? - I'm going sister Gul. Good bye Murat. - Good bye Gull. - Murat. - Murat. - My Gull. Murat! - I put you in trouble too. - It's ok brother. Anyway I... ...needed some rest. A year will just fly away quickly. It's not about a year Mistik. It doesn't matter if I stay in prison for five years, as long as Gull starts seeing again. Do you think she's in hospital now? Who knows? Maybe she's in the operation room. Maybe she's healed. And seeing everything now. Open your eyes my girl. Oh my god! I'm seeing! Thank you a million my God! Finally I'm seeing! Monsieur Artin! - Monsieur Artin. - I'm not Artin. So she's seeing now! She left the hospital today. What did she do? Where did you take her? She didn't even recognize me. There was a luxurious car outside. Next to it was a fat rich man. She ran towards him. Said Monsieur Artin. I felt embarrassed... ...l couldn't introduce myself to her. We made up a lot didn't we Murat brother? We're not a part of her life anymore. We don't have anything to give to her anymore. We brightened up her dark days. Created a beautiful world in her dreams. A sunny world. We did our bat. - (Maybe we can happen to see her someday')? - Who knows? Maybe. Murat brother. You're thinking of her, aren't you Murat brother? You Mistik? Aren't you thinking of her? I'm thinking too but yours is different. Three months have passed. God knows where she is. I wonder if she's happy? Murat brother. - Do you think she'll forget us? - I don't know, I don't think so. She shouldn't forget. Can we forget her? She has been the only hope of our... ...vagabond days. Now I'm thinking of her. Now I'm living with the hope that I may see her one day. We'll see Murat brother, We'll find her. They say if one wants something for 40 days, it will happen for sure. We have been wandering for her for 90 days. The only consolation of the dark days spent behind these iron bars is... her bright face, silky hair, her eyes looking at me but not seeing me. Now she's seeing Murat brother, she'll see us too. I wonder if she'll love like she used to? For example I, I am not that handsome. But you... ...l think she'll love you Murat brother. Who knows? Maybe she got married. She's not supposed to wait for us forever. There was this Crab Ali in the ward, he was a murderer, was doing... ...racketeering. One day he tried to force us for money, Murat brother... ...hit him with such a head butt. What a fight it was. Are you still thinking of Gul? - She must be still in Istanbul, what do you say? - Where else can she be? I'll look for her. Mistik, if you want do the shoe shining job again. You'll stay with Artin. You also have a job. I'll be where you are Murat brother, Did we spend... ...those times for nothing in the jail? We'll look for Gul together. Maybe this isn't right. Maybe when she sees us... ...she won't be pleased, and feel ashamed. But I have to find her. She is bread, water everything for me. I can't leave without her anymore. Istanbul is huge, but we may be lucky. I'll take my shoe shining set and go around street by street. And I'll take photographs everywhere. And I will work in every job I find to earn ...a living and in the remaining times... ...look for Gull. Come my dear, come my child, Come honey. You take the other please. Come my dear. Please let me for a minute and I'll give your money. There you are. Sister Gull! Sister Gull. You brass neck. Ok Nuri pops. Give me 200 more banners. Placard these too. You'll get 5 liras more. - No I've a job to do. - Your choice. - Good bye. - Bye bye. - Nope. - Nope brother. Come on cheers. It's been three months we've been looking for her. There isn't even one place left that we haven't checked in Istanbul. What'll we do? We'll never be able to see her. I think we should give up. And start working... ...again. And find a proper place to stay for the three of us. Maybe one day all of a sudden God will find her for us. I can't work! It's as if while I'm working... ...she would pass behind me, near me and I won't see her this is how I feel. I know that I won't be able to do anything without her. Aye aye sir. - Gul! - Those were the days. Ali. Stop this whining, let's listen to - ...something joyful. - Aye aye sir. After this song. Didn't you hear me? Stop that whining. Stop that whining. - To me? - To you. So what? I know how to stop it. Don't touch it! - Where're you going buddy? - I want to see Miss Gul Peri. You want to see Miss Gul Peri? Get lost young man, This isn't the right place for you. - They sent flowers for Miss Gul Peri. - Ok, take it inside. We told you young man, Come on get lost. What's up Murat brother? Sister Gull! Look uncle Ahdin look! We found her! We found her! What's happening to him? Come on tell us Murat brother. - What happened? - Nothing. Why aren't you happy? - Have you seen Gul? - I went to see her; to the club she works in... ...l was full of joy. Suddenly I felt everything was solved. It was... ...as if I could hold her in my arms. - Didn't she recognize you? - I couldn't see her, they didn't let me in. Now she is far away, she's pan of a... ...very different world. Rich, famous, look at us. They brought 3 bouquets while I was there. Each worth 100 liras. Our wage for 3 months. - So what are we going to do now? - Nothing. - Shall we go for once? - She wouldn't recognize us. That's better; we'll go and watch her easily, although from far away... ...we'll Sister Gul. Peri Gul, Peri Gull, Peri Gull. Bravo, bravo... bravo. Look Gull is there! Bravo, bravo... My dear audience; now I'll sing you At Nights the stars... ...by composer Abdullah Yuce, that you dearly love and which is... ...the song of my unforgettable happiest days and full of... ...beautiful memories. Look Murat brother. At nights the stars are as if asking about my troubles. The world is a huge grave... ...life without you is nothing. I look for you everywhere, I ask the flying birds... ...about you. I cry silently, maybe you'll hear my cries. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo... Move away you tramp. - Don't push sissy, have you dropped your precious gems? Look at damn snob? Who were you talking to? Show him. Who was the man you talked last? Tell me? Please tell me now who was he. I have been waiting for the person who has... ...this voice for years. Please tell me. If you tell me who it was... ...you'll do me a big favor. I'm begging you please tell me. It was Mistik's voice. Murat! Murat! Murat! - Gul. - My Murat! My Gul... You fool, were you going to leave me here? Wasn't the foolishness you did before enough? - Gul from now on we... - Stop. Is it important anymore? Leave the past aside. - Sister Gull. - Mistik. Sister Gull. Monsieur Artin. Let's go now. Flowers of laughter at the sea side, honeysuckles... ...our little white house surrounded by vervain flowers... ...let's go to the home of our dreams. - To happy days! - Ok. Do you know what I'll cook for you? Noodle soup! Peri sister Gull, Peri sister Gul... Good bye.
