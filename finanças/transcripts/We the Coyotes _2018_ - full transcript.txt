Jake, Jake, are you awake? Hmm? What's up? Feel the air. Wow. Yeah, it's different. It's not dry. It's a different kind of hot. I've never felt this before. - It's kind of shiny. - "Shiny"? Yeah. Give me a fucking kiss. Thank you. Okay, 4626. I think, I think... up here. - Yeah. - That it? Yeah. Ready? Jeanine! - Hi, I'm Jake. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Well, welcome to Tarzan. - Thank you. Well, come on in. Sorry, hey. Okay, the boys are sleeping, so we have to... I'm sorry we got here so late. Oh, no, it's fine. Oh, my god, look at you, you're so grown up. You look like your mom. Oh, god, don't say that. Okay, so, you have an interview tomorrow. I do, yeah, 1:00 P.M. in Hollywood. So, you should probably leave round 11:30. Traffic can get crazy. Yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking. Great. Is this you, babe? Oh, man, I forgot about this picture! -Yeah. You were so cute. I was so little. Well, you guys must be wiped out. Yes. - Yes. Okay, I'll show you to your rooms. You will be sleeping upstairs in the guest room. And Jake, you're going to be in Bob's office. - There's... - Uh... Well, we usually just sleep in the same room, - because you know, we're a couple and all. I know. I know, I know, I thought about it, it's just... The boys go to catholic school, so... Oh, I don't remember you being religious. I'm not. But it's not a conversation that I really want to have with them yet and the last thing I need is for them to say anything in school. So... Children are the future. I can't sleep. You didn't tell me it was a monastery here. I'm sorry. I had no idea that she was going to be like this. It's no big deal. Oh, really? I mean, besides that, - this ain't a bad spot to be, uh, kicking it. Do you know if this thing has bubbles? Uh, there's gotta be a switch somewhere. When are we gonna make some money quick, so we can get out of here? Hey, in the worst case scenario, the restaurant told me they'd hire me back if things didn't work out here. And I'm sure I could get you a job there too. Jake... But, babe, we're moving here, that's the plan. I know. I know. It's just backup plan. Found the switch. Mom, Tim took the backpack. Ow! Oh, I was so hungry. Right. Me too. This is so much better than gas station breakfast. Sure is. So, um, what are you going to do here, Jake? Uh, oh, man. Sorry. Um... I don't know, I just want to take a couple of days, get used to the city. Um, yeah. - Feel that out a little bit. I've never seen the pacific, so I wanted to get onto the beach. And maybe check out the Griffith observatory. So I figure I'll do that. Well, that sounds like a solid start. Well, Jake's been working in several different fields and he just needs to figure out exactly what he wants to do here. Right, babe? Yeah. So, um, how's uncle Bob? When does he get back? He's good. He, um... He's gone for another two weeks. He's in China right now and then he's in London - and... Somewhere else after that. I don't know, it's hard to keep track of him. Wow! - He's road wide. - Yeah. He's gone, you know, half the time. Sometimes more. Shit. That's a lot. Ooh, Jake used a bad word. - I'm sorry. - Shit. Oh, oh, don't do it. - Shit. - God! Uh-uh. Enough with the attitude, okay? -Give me... give me the screen. No! - Yeah. I need to finish this game first. You don't need to finish the game and you've been on it all morning. That was him. I only had it for like 10 minutes. - I'm so close. - What did I say? You guys wanna, uh, show me the pool I can show you guys some flips. Mom won't allow us to go out to the pool without adult supervision. Dylan, he is an adult, you idiot. Oh, yeah, that's right. Mom, can we go to the pool with jakey? - Please, can we? - Yeah. - Yes. - Thanks. Go put your suits on. Don't forget the sunscreen. Okay. All right, which one of you guys is the best? I am. Are you ready? Is it cold? Oh, my god! Thank you. So, um... Jake is interesting. - Yeah? - Yeah. How long have you guys been dating? - Just over six months now. - Oh, wow! Oh, my god, so it's new? But, you're already moving in? Um, yeah, but, I mean, we've practically been living together all summer. Really? - Yeah. And it seems kind of dumb to try and pay for two rents. Yeah. Yeah. Just... Your mom's pretty worried, that's all. Yeah? What is she worried about? Him. Well, mom decided she didn't like Jake before she even met him. - What? - It's nothing. It's just... Did she tell you to have this conversation me or... No. No, come on. Do you think I would do that? Come on. Jump with the donut, dy. I didn't even see you because I was already in. - Here. - Give me the ball. I got it. done today? He's not even trying to get a job. He has no future. I know you see that. I'm sorry, aunt jeanine... You have to stand on it. Just try. Are you in? Yeah. Do... do the thing you used to do down here. - and I know you. I hear you and I hear... -You're... You're not hearing me. - Both of my parents. It's my own life, okay? And I can make my own decisions. Jake? Jake. Jake. -What? -We're gonna leave, right now. Let's go. Oh, yeah? Thank you. So you want to tell me what happened in there? You don't want to know. Yeah, I actually do. Well, she basically just told me that you're the biggest loser on the planet. Your whole family thinks I'm the biggest loser on the planet. You know, I thought it was just my parents, and now we're here and jeanine's saying the same thing, and it's bullshit, Jake! Yeah, it is bullshit, but, what are we supposed to do now? I don't know. I guess, we get a shitty motel for a few nights until we figure out what's next. And how does all this fit into your little budget? Um... I actually have some extra cash that I think we can use. Oh, yeah? What is it? This bit of extra cash? Where did you find that? You should really get better at hiding your money. I'm sorry, I didn't know you'd be going through my shit! Where did you get it? Why are you so fucking nosy today? My dad gave it to me. Oh, he gave it to you? Yeah. And I'm going to pay him back. It's just like a... Just in case. I feel like shit. And I look like shit, I'm sure and I don't know how I'm supposed to do this interview right now. Relax. Look, we came all this way. You can't start acting like a brat now, just 'cause you got into a fight with your aunt. You're gonna be fine. Will you please just tell me one more thing, Jake? Yeah, what's that? Why is it that you are such a loser? Probably because I'm dating you. - Right here? - Wow! Should we stop? Do we have time? - Yup. - Yeah? Yeah. I want to get a house over there, like an apartment at the top with a swimming pool on the roof. They have the beach there, right? Put in a surf shop. That'd be the life. Wait, I have a text. Uh, "found a place called mooky coffee. "Meet there at 2:00. 1915 north Bronson Avenue." Signed d boy. Yeah, that's Danny. I told him to text your phone, so we can meet up while you're at your interview. Okay. Well, you make sure to ask if we can stay in his house for a few weeks. Yeah, I know. I will. I already thought about that. Fuck, why is it so hot? Slight pit stains. I'll just keep my arms down like this the entire time. It'll be like I don't think we can hire... I'm kidding. I'm totally just kidding. - Don't say that. - I'm totally just kidding. I'm so excited to be here. I think what you guys are doing is really interesting. We have to go about things differently. There's so much demand and... And competition out there, -you know, like... -And how do you think you're gonna make... I'm so fucking nervous. I have all the answers, but I don't even know what to say right now. - Yeah, you do. You're fine. - I'm just like freaking out. I'm so fucking stressed. You're fine. Relax. It's not that serious. It is serious. - It is serious. But you're gonna be okay. Just answer the fucking questions. - I'm gonna answer the questions. - You're good, then. Chill the fuck out, dude. - Here. - Here? Yes. - Here? Yes, here. - Thank you. - I'll slow down. -I will see you back here in two hours. -In two hours. Yes, got it. Thank you. Hey, babe. - What? - Kill it. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Okay. - Excuse me? - Hmm? Do you possibly have a pen that I can borrow? Oh, of course. - Thank you. - All right. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Mmm-hmm. - I'm Amanda, by the way. - Chelsea. - It's nice to meet you. But they have this, like... - Supreme records... - Uh... this is Claire, how can I help you? Chelsea? Um... I'm just curious, what did you put for "salary desired'? Well, it's different for everyone. So, what I wrote down won't help you. Just take your previous salary and add 10%. Something like that. This is kind of my... My first job. Yes, that's pretty obvious. - Daisy, we're ready for you now. - Thank you. Wherever he works, if you think about him. It's like he's not around. Creepy and shitty to women. -Yeah. But as someone to work with, -he's great at his job so he gets a pass. -Yeah. And people don't hold guys ike that accountable. That's the thing. You have to like, pretend like everything's okay. And that's like the worst part. You know, working in music is like the blend between the professional and social. It's like... it's, you know. It's the two... Um, Chelsea, we're ready for you now. Great. My daughter-in-law is a hipster... Is that what you call them? So I'm trying to get her something trendy, you know. Yeah, well, I don't think you can go wrong with either of these. - I mean... - Um... this one has great vegetarian recipes and, yeah... You know, well, if you think they're good, um... I'll just get them both, it's just so hard to get her something. - So, yeah, I'll just get them both. Are you sure? - Yeah, if you like them... - Yeah! I'm sure they're good. I think she's gonna love it. Yeah. - Thank you so much. - And if she doesn't -you can always bring it back. -We're going back to New York, so I don't know about that... Oh! Well... - Yeah. But my friend recommended the store and she said that I had to come here. Oh, thank you. I'll tell everyone I know. - Thanks for coming in. - I really appreciate your help. - Thank you so much. Bye. - Bye. So you're into French poetry. I saw you guys have uh, quite the collection over there. - Yeah. Thanks. - Yeah. Who's your favorite? Probably Francis ponge. That's unusual. Do you speak French? - No. I mean... - Do you read in French? I try as much as I can. I don't understand anything when I try to read in French. Sometimes I'm not understanding everything either, but... The words in French have their own musicality, almost. - Yeah, I've heard that before. Um, I'll have to give it a try again. - Yeah. - Thirteen dollars. Mmm-hmm. Here you go. Thank you. Um, I saw you guys were looking for someone to work here? Yes. We were. "Were"? Yeah, we... we interviewed a lot of people already and so, my partner and I, we're going to make our decision based on the applicants we already have. - Oh, okay. - Why? Were you interested? Um, I mean, yeah. I just moved here and I'm looking for a job. And, um, I've always sort of wanted to work in a bookstore. So you've never worked in a bookstore? I mean, no, but I'm always reading. Right, um... - Do you have a resume on you? - Um, I do. - Here you go. I just broke my phone. Um, if you don't mind, -I'm just gonna put my girlfriend's number down. -Yeah, sure. Here you go. - Okay, Jake. I'll add your resume to the ones selected and I'll tell my partner about you. That'd be awesome. - Thank... can you put in a good word for me? Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll tell him that you... Can make a latte. And that you seem very knowledgeable despite your complete lack of experience. Well, I'd appreciate that. - The best lattes, though. - Yeah, the best. - Absolutely. - Super. He sounds so cheesy, doesn't he? How about you? Have you met anyone recently? There's this guy in my yoga class, -he's been putting his mat next to mine... -Oh, my god. a couple of times. And then, the other day, he asked me out. We went to that Mexican vegan restaurant. Oh, I wanted to go there. It's so good. It's about... It's a web series. Uh, it's about a woman. She's recently divorced. She meets this homeless dog. And it's kind of about their, like, uncanny relationship. Mmm-hmm. -And I think you could be kind of perfect for it. You know, that sounds amazing. Thank you. Because you're going to get to do... I mean, I just want to take the character - left and right. Up and down. - Yeah. Up and down. I mean, you know how I get when I play characters. You know. "C" stands for "cat". - That's my name. - Jake. What's going on, gilmore, how are you man? - Good? - Yeah, I'm good. Yeah! - Yeah, it's good to see you. -Good to see you, too, man. Welcome to the city. Man, how do you like it here? It's cool. It's different. You're not gonna wanna leave here. Trust me. How are you? How's the music and everything? I saw you were playing a bunch of shows. - You know, here and there. - Yeah? -Yeah. Things been going good. -That's good, man. When's your next one? Tonight. Actually, I got this, uh, big-ass house party to do. You should come by. Shit, man, this is like good old times. The address is right there. I always knew you'd make it. Yeah, man. What about you, gilmore, huh? What about me? I heard you got something serious going on. Amanda, right? Yeah. She's cool. You see... Don't give me that look. How about you? How's the... How's the dating scene here? Ooh. Yeah, man... I've had a few adventures, if you will. I'm sure it's real tough getting laid here, being a rapper and all. You know, I'm kind of over it though. You know, maybe I should find something more serious, like you. - Yeah? - Find a nice girl, settle down. I get a dog, I start working out, I move to the valley. Wow! Kind of loud. Hey, buddy, just, uh, two friends reconnecting over here. Yeah, man. You wanna get something from here? No, man, I think I'm, uh, good on the $6 cups of coffee. I'll save that fanciness for you. Welcome to la, man, that's called a single-cup pour over. - Is that what that's called? - Yeah. I think it's called bullshit. That's bougie. - "Bougie"? - Mmm. - Amanda. - Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Greg. This is dick. - Awesome. - Have a seat, please. - Thank you. - Of course. I do wanna let you guys know I'm so thrilled to be here. I think what you're doing at supreme is not only innovative but audacious. And it's super exciting. Oh, thanks for that, Amanda. Could you uh, tell us about your responsibilities at major lakes records. Well, I... I was the key intern for my entire time there. Um... I was mostly working directly under the executive administrator and, uh, you know, my responsibilities ranged from screening calls, scheduling and coordinating meetings with artists and take notes during those meetings and additionally, I was responsible for training all new interns that came on. Okay. Do you consider yourself a self-starter? Certainly. Uh... -Definitely, I would consider myself a self-starter. -That's good. That's good to hear. Can you uh, can you maybe give us an example? - Um... - Any one. Yeah, uh, let's see. About a month after I started at major lakes, uh... We... we host this annual showcase, you know, it's a big deal, all of our artists perform. Um, and about an hour before the event started, our social media person called in with the flu. Uh, my boss, he wanted to go offline for the entire event, but I... I stepped up to the plate... um, and handled it all. And, uh, we actually received more positive feedback that year than any previous. - Wow, that's awesome. - That's great. Yeah, that's awesome. Your boss must have been thrilled about that. Yeah, yeah, he was pretty stoked. Uh, do you think that, uh... We could stay at your place for a few days? Uh, the thing is, man, I'm kind of living in my car right now. What? Uh, I had this really cheap place at first, but they wanted to tear it down and start making room for new condos. So I got kicked out. That's fucked, man. It's okay. Save up some cash and figure it out. Yeah. You know, when me and Amanda get a spot, you can just come stay with us. Thanks, bro. Yeah. Totally. Weren't you supposed to be staying with Amanda's people? Yeah, we were, but, uh, it didn't really work out too well. I don't know. Things have just always been kind of weird between me and her family. What? You don't like them? I don't really know them that well. I mean, they're cool, I guess. It's just... There's been some awkward moments. -So... -Well, as long as you got Amanda, - fuck 'em. - Yeah. How could I be so lucky? Hit me with it. - You ready? - Let's do it. Uh, okay... - Pow! All right. All right. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. Come on. Come on. You still got it, you still got it, jg. You still got it. I mean, community management skills are a great thing to have today. -Yeah. -Greg over here can't do that, can you, Greg? - Why would you say that? - I mean, it's true. -Why would you just dog me in front of her, like that, bro? -I'm just saying. Okay, so my daughter has been teaching me, - she's been trying to teach me how to use snap... what is it? - Snapchat. Snapchat, yeah. - Snapchat. - Different from Instagram? - It is totally different. Whatever the case is, I don't get it, I don't get any of it. Oh, you know what, maybe you could help me, right? With that? Definitely. That's something I could do. Could you give us a second? - Yeah. - Um... I think we should just go ahead and hire her because I don't want... I guess it's not like we need to go... - I think you just did hire her. Like a bullhorn, but... All right, Amanda, uh, you got a great resume and a great attitude, so... Here's the deal, we have a intern position opening up next week, and we would - like to offer it to you. Yeah, so it's an unpaid position, but we offer free parking and a membership to the gym in the building. - Mmm-hmm. It has a pool. - It's right downstairs - so it's super convenient. - Very. You're gonna love it. Oh, um... But I... I did apply for the administrative assistant position, um, not an internship. Oh, okay, so let me... So we only hire our administrative assistants form out intern pool. - Yeah. - So, I don't know, - after maybe eight to... - About twelve. - twelve? - Yeah. twelve months, we can set up another interview and discuss possibilities then. What do you say? - So I would have to work for a year for free, before you even considered hiring me? No, no, no, not free, just unpaid. Yeah. Right. Um... Well, to be perfectly blunt, uh, I can't afford to work for free. I mean, all we can offer you is an unpaid internship. Right. Um... I want you guys to know that I do have the experience and... And skills and I believe that if you took the chance on me that I wouldn't disappoint you. Amanda, this is a very big record company. You're lucky we're even offering you an internship. You know, people in this town would kill for an opportunity like this. So you're saying the company is only able to offer positions to people who are rich? - I don't... uh, sorry... - No, that's not... - That's not true. - We're not saying that at all. We're offering you an internship. I... I don't think many young people can afford to work for free. - Um... Amanda, that's the way we operate. - without their families' support. They've got parents to pay for their lives. What're you talking about? Well, I don't. Okay. Well, then, this probably isn't the job for you. - Um... - This... Okay, any... Do you want to say something else? -Okay, you know what, thank you so much for your time. -Oh. - Oh. - Nice to meet you. Right. You can validate your parking with Claire at the front desk. She'll take care of you. - Okay. - You can see yourself out. Thanks. This is crazy, man. Where do you think they're all going? You tripping, man. - Come on. The loud got you. - It got to me, man. Don't even think twice. How'd it go? Do you realize how long I've been sitting here? You said two hours, right? Yeah. Which makes you late. Babe, I don't have a phone. And you know I don't know this place. How'd it go? It was a waste of time. I mean, they said that I was qualified and then they offered me an unpaid internship. Are you gonna take it? No, I'm not gonna take it. It's... it's not paid. Did you ask Danny if we could stay with him for a few days? I did. But he's living in his car right now. Great. Maybe we should ask him where he parks, 'cause we might end up there soon. Danny did help me with something though. What? Some medical marijuana. It's really high quality. Fuck! What? What, Amanda? This is what you do while I'm in an interview. You're out scoring drugs with your homeless stoner friend. I thought you'd enjoy a little stimulant. Yeah, I would. But in case you didn't realize, Jake, we have other shit to deal with today. Yeah, and clearly you have a genius fucking plan. No, I don't. But I figure we go to the car we get my laptop and we try and figure something out. Look, at this point, I really think it'd be more beneficial for us to smoke a little bit of this weed and start getting acclimated with this city. - We don't even know this place. - Really? Is that what you think? I know you're upset about you interview and all, I get it, but that's not my fault. At least, I had an interview. Fuck you, Amanda. I followed you all the way out here. I quit my job for you. And now you're trying to put the blame on me? -Okay, you did not follow me out here. -No? No. We came out here together. And I cannot be the only one who's trying to... I don't know. I just can't do this alone. It... it feels like I... I... Maybe it was a mis... I don't know. Maybe... Maybe you and I shouldn't have come out here together. This is fucking bullshit, Amanda. Wait. Thought I parked it here. - What do you mean, here? - What the fuck? No, I thought I parked it right here. Well, did you or didn't you? I did. Yeah, what the fuck? Did someone steal it? "No stopping 2:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M." Did you not read the sign, Jake? Yeah, I read the fucking sign. Are you kidding me? Yeah. Oops! This shit better not be fucking closed. Yes, yes. Coming, I'm coming. Coming. Hey. Um, this way, please. How can I help you? Our car just got towed in Hollywood, and we called the number on the sign, and they told us it was here. Mmm-hmm. Um, license plate and driver's license, please. Dude, I don't even know the license plate number. How can I find your car if you don't know the license plate? It couldn't have gotten here more than two hours ago, man. I mean, can you just look at my license? Um. Make and model. Give me make and model. It's a '98, Nissan pathfinder. Um, let's try. Uh... Piece of shit computer. Found it. And... It's going to be, uh, $536 to release the car. - Car should then become... - What, I'm sorry, $500? You think we tow cars for free of charge here? Look, man... -There's no way we can afford that. Can you cut us any sort of deal? The car's not even worth $500. Yeah. If you can't pay now, you can leave the car here, but it's going to be extra $125 everyday. No. We can't pay now, man. No, we're paying now, man. Cash or debit? Um, we actually have some cash in the car that we should use. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, look, we just want to get our money from our car so that we can pay you. This is not flea market. No bargaining. Jesus Christ, man. Fuck it, let's just pay. Okay, well, I mean, I don't know if I even have enough in my account, so... We'll split it. Yeah. Can you just, like half-and-half? What the fuck is this? What is that? A fucking $175 parking ticket. Hey, man, what the fuck it this? A parking ticket? $175? On top of the 500 we just paid! Uh, not my business, I'm not police. What... what do you mean? It's not my business. - Jake, what the fuck do you mean... -Jake, where's the money? It's in the glove box, babe. - Okay, well, it's not there now. - Are you fucking kidding me? -Did you lock the doors? -Yeah, I locked the fucking doors. Well, then where is it? Hey, asshole. We left some fucking money in the car, where is it? I don't know what you're talking about? Yo, we just had money in the motherfucking car! Where is it? - Hey, hey, hey! - You have the fucking money! - You can't... - Jesus Christ! - With your fucking wrench. Huh! Get the fuck out of here or I'll call the cops. Then call the fucking cops, you bitch-ass... - I will call the cops. - Can we please go in the car? We're okay, just... - Assholes. - Just get in the car. Just... - Jake... - Are you kidding me? Let's just go. Fuck! White trash. Just drive. Oh, Jesus. We shouldn't be leaving here without the money. I know he fucking has it. Okay. I think he has it too, Jake, but like, what are we supposed to do? I can't make him give it to us. Where do you want to go? I don't know. Well, what do you want to do? I. Don't. Know. Jesus! Don't worry about it. No, seriously, I mean, I'll... I'll get a job waitressing or... Or, something, anything, I'll make some money and... It's you and me, right here. Right now. Sure, yeah, what would it take... How long would it take to launch a nuclear missile once you got the... Uh, okay, at my level, at the lowest level of the chain of command, it would take about one minute. We would receive a launch order from a higher authority, jump out of our seats uh, in astonishment, open a safe that is locked by pad locks, pull out codes and launch keys. Check the codes in our safe against the codes in the launch order. And if they match, we would proceed to carry out a launch, uh, checklist that would take about one minute to carry out. Uh, we weren't... Should we check it out? Why not? Hey, sorry, do you know if there's an open house happening? Yeah. Cool. How's it going? - Uh... - Good. Yeah, good. How about you? Not too bad. Just having the craziest day. And why is that? I have to pick up these business cards in century city and I've been looking at apartments all day but they're shitholes, - so... What, did you just move out here? Yeah. Took the red eye out. Popped a xani. Got hammered as fuck, but... Couldn't get a minute of sleep, so I'm basically hung over dealing with all this bullshit. It sucks. Did you love out here for work or? Yeah. I'm starting a job in a couple of days at this talent agency so, I have to rush out. Well, you're lucky you had something lined up, you know. It helps when you know the right people. Yeah. Who do you know? Let's just say my granddad runs the agency. Do you know if there happen to be any openings? I don't think they're hiring right now, uh... But, um... Shoot me an email. We'll grab a drink sometime. All right, guys, I'm going to have you guys all come in together for the next visit. "Shoot me an email. My grandfather... What a fucking pretentious jerk. I'm sure my parents would love him. A tenant is still occupying the apartment, so please, be respectful to her stuff. If you're interested, information sheets are on the table. You'd have to be a fucking Syrian refugee to want to live there. There was a fucking condom on the ground. Someone walked over it. Yes, a used condom on the ground. Jake. Hey, what's up, man? Hey, do you need a jacket? - Hell, yeah. - Yeah? Uh, what the fuck are you doing? - Thanks, man. - Have a good one, brother. - You too. Thanks, dude. - Yeah. Aw, dude, what the fuck! Hey! What the fuck? - Ah, freezing! - Come in. Come on. - Hi, mom. - - Amanda, finally, I've been trying to reach you all day. Where are you? Um, I'm at the beach. I'm glad you got there safely. How was your job interview? It was great. Well, that's good to hear. Fingers crossed. Uh, honey, uh, there's something really important I'd like to talk to you about. Sure. What's up? After you and Jake left, we realized that a lot of money had disappeared from your father's desk. We looked at it from every angle, honey, and I hate to say this, but it could really only be Jake. We haven't had anyone else over here since you left. I'm sorry, honey, but I've been trying to tell you this guy doesn't have any good intentions. - Mom. - Yes? - Amanda? - I took it. What are you talking about? Um... I took the money. I don't understand. You... You're such a smart girl, Amanda. I... Why would you do something like that? I'm really sorry. I... I think you better come home. Amanda. Amanda, are you listening to me? Who is it? Amanda? Come on! - Um... - This is what I want. - What? Amanda... - Hello? - Hi! Could I speak to Jake, please? Um... I'm sorry, but he's... He's not available. Uh, may I ask who's calling? Um, you don't know me. Um, I'm... my name is Jennifer. I... I own the shop called book show. Um, and Jake was here earlier and he dropped off his resume and I just wanted, we wanted to let him that we'd like to hire him. Oh... Oh... Well, uh, that's amazing. Thank you so much. -Yeah. Um, actually though, could you ask him if he could start on Monday? Yeah. Yeah. I think he can. Uh... I'll... I'll check with him, though. Yeah, okay, great. That's great. Um, so it's 9:00 A.M. Monday, and if he has any questions, you can call us. Okay. That sounds good. Thank you very much. Yeah, of course. Thank you. Bye. Baby! This it? You guys made it. Oh, Danny! I'm so glad you guys came, man. What's up, man? - I'm good. I'm good, man. I'm fucking happy you're here. Hey, man, this is Amanda. - Amanda, it is so dope to finally meet you. Jake has said so much good stuff about you. Really? Like what? Oh, my god, so many great things. That you're the love of his life and he can't live without you. And that you're getting married and you're beautiful, which he wasn't lying about. Ooh, we're getting married? Oh, yeah. Of course. Hey, can I officiate? We can go to Vegas right after the party. All right. That's enough. I'm gonna go grab a beer. - Um, babe? - Please. Yes. - All right. I'll let, uh, you guys get to know each other. Yeah. Jake told me you wanted to be in the music business? I'm sorry, was that the wrong subject? No, it's fine. Er, it's just that right now I... I don't really know what I want. You guys just got here. You need some time to settle in. You know, he, um, he played me some of your music and I really liked it. Yeah? I actually think it's really something. Hey, maybe you could work with me? Yeah, like how? You could be my manager or something. Manager or something? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. We got all these artists here making this dope music, we don't know shit about getting out to the world. Well, I don't know how useful I could be, but, that sounds like fun. We should talk more about it. Maybe. Maybe tomorrow. Yo. Cheers, to your new life here. Daniel! Hey! - Whoo! - Hello, Katie. - Hello. - Thank you, baby. - And Mona. - Hi. Hello. Pleasure seeing you. Just showin' my friends around. This is Amanda and that's Jake. Oh, I've never seen you two. - Your hair is so soft. - Thank you. - Katie, come feel it. So you guys just moved here? - Yeah, we just got here yesterday. Where from? Uh, Illinois. You're from la, or... Born and raised. So, did you guys just... So you can't tell me nothing, baby, nothing as much as I could today... - Well, there you are. - What's up, Dan? Come on, let's go, man. - All right. - Are we going? All right, come on. Come on. Where are we going? I'm gonna fuck you up. We just gotta go around this gate. Are we allowed? Shh, you gotta be quiet. Shh. Shh. What if someone sees us? I don't know. You might get kicked out of the country, actually. I thought we were supposed to be quiet up here. No, howling is okay. People are just going to think it's wolves. Very convincing. You heard me beat you, Danny. Wait. What was that? It's a coyote. Jake, they heard us. Wait... What? You should see your face right now. Don't worry, you see them everywhere here. They're harmless. Yeah. Unless there's an entire pack of them and you're by yourself. No, shit. Guys, look. Yeah, I've never seen them this close. That's wild. It's our first time waking up here together. Except, we're not waking up. The sun is waking up. Yo, come on, guys. Just a minute.
