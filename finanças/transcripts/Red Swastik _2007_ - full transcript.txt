I am sorry, ma'am. Sir has still not returned. He had said he will return within 2 hours. And he is not even answering his cell. I tried calling him. Yes. Even I have tried many times. Maybe he left his cell in the car. But where are you, ma'am. In the hotel? I will inform sir as soon as he returns. No, no! I am already on my way to the airport. I have checked out from the hotel. What! You are returning today itself? I thought you were going to stay in Kolkata till tomorrow. No. My appointment materialised today only. Even Shyam was not feeling fine... ...when he had come to drop me. So I thought of checking out. Then ma'am, maybe he went home. No. I don't think he is at home. I tried calling at home many times. You don't worry. I will again try calling on his cell. Shall I send the car for you at the airport? No, don't worry about that. I will take a cab from the airport. You just tell Shyam that I am returning. In case you contact him. Okay, ma'am. Bye. Have a nice flight. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. 'GIobal Indian announces the departure of its flight to Mumbai.' 'Passengers are requested to proceed for security check.' 'Thank you.' - Where is he? Sorry, darling! What happened? So weaker! How insensitive! I wasn't asleep. I just dozed off. Your body is so intoxicating. Please put the zip. Why so soon, sweetheart? We still have to together drink that special drink. Forgot your promise? We can have that drink even after dressing up. I have already prepared it. But if we are unclothed... then the drink can taste more delicious. Am I right? - Okay. Have it your way. I will get the drink. In 30 seconds flat. And you... just relax. Have it. Oome on. Why this cheating? Full glass for me. And only half glass for you. I don't drink during daytime. I am drinking this too to just give you company. Oheers! Fantastic! I am telling you! Good! Yeah! Okay, Nikki! Get this interview done! Good! We will hold the page for you! Okay! Done! You look harassed! What happened? It's that woman again! - Which woman? That mysterious woman whose article we had... ...discussed in today's editorial meeting! Oh! That woman! What happened to her? She is on the phone. She is being very rude and abusive. She wants to talk to you. Will you please take her call? Okay. I will handle her. Oonnect me to her. Sally, transfer the call here. Ma'am will talk. Yeah. Hello! Sarika here. What can I do for you? Sarika, I am very upset with your sub-editor Beena. I am regular reader of 'Today's Woman'. How can she refuse to publish my article? How can she turn it down? Look, Beena is doing the right thing. We have discussed both, your article and last letter... ...in the editorial meeting. We can't publish your letter. Sorry. - Why? It doesn't follow our editorial policy. We think it's not fine for our readers. Fine, Sarika. Now what I am going to do... you will be responsible for that. Only you. What do you mean? What are you going to do? What I am going to do... you will get the inkling in my article. What do you mean? You will find out soon... that what do I mean. Listen... please give me your name and address. In your article and letter only W is written for name and address. Goodbye, Sarika! She hung up! Just like that! What if she... You want to inform the police about her? You think I should? Should I? There is no harm. Why don't you talk to DOP Ohaudhary? You know him well. I think you are right. I will talk to him. Sally, you have DOP Ohaudhary's... ...direct number, don't you? Oonnect me to him. Blood is worship. Blood is penance. Blood is worship. Blood is penance. Blood is conduct. Blood is conduct. Blood, blood, blood. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Blood, blood, blood. Blood, blood, blood. Blood is destruction. Blood is creation. Blood is destruction. Blood is creation. Even if blood betrayed, it is still trust. Let the filthiness of blood be cleansed with blood. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. It is difficult, Sarika. It is really very difficult. In such a huge city, to find out about a woman... ...just on the basis of a phone call. And that too when we don't have her phone number. And we don't know from which area she has called you. It's not necessary that she has called from Mumbai. It could be an outstation call too. Do you understand our problem? I think... Iogically you are right. But that call... her voice... the way she was talking. I tell you, she is here only. In this city. Okay. Let's assume that she is in this city. So? We can't say for sure that she has done something... ...or she is going to do something. And no report has been filed of any accident or murder... ...that we could take some action. Sarika, listen to me. Just take it easy. Relax. And don't worry so much. Looks like a hoax call to me. And we frequently receive such calls. There are some weird people. They behave like this for weird sense of humour. It means... we just forget about it? No, no! I am sorry. I don't mean that. I just want to tell you to be alert. If she calls you again, then there is something fishy. In that case, you will have to handle it tactfully. And you will have to try to extract... ...maximum information from her. Okay. And if she calls... inform me immediately. If blood melts... only blood boils. If blood melts... only blood boils. If blood is impure... then only blood cleanse it. Only blood stains cleanse blood. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Let the blood flow. Oome! DOP Ohaudhary? At this hour? What happened? I am sorry. The matter is such that I had to disturb you. He is inspector Ranade from crime branch. Oan we... can we come in? What happened? A terrible incident has occurred, ma'am. We need to talk to you urgently. A top and reputed businessman... ...has been murdered brutally... ...in his own apartment's bedroom. He had illegitimate sexual relation with a mysterious woman. When his wife was not at home in the afternoon... ...he had sex with a woman before being murdered. We found his naked body soaked in blood on the bed. He was stabbed on his neck and murdered. But me... When our officers, as per the routine, redialled the last number... ...from the bedroom phone... it connected to your office. From your security guard we didn't find out who spoke to whom. Because apparently your office was closed at that time. So? We called the exchange and took... ...out the printout of the calls made by that phone. The calls that we are talking about... At the same time when you spoke... ...to that mysterious caller today in the afternoon. Oh my God! Are you sure that the woman... ...with whom he had sex murdered him? Maybe somebody else was there. And murder was committed later. It seems so, ma'am. But we can't say anything for sure. We are still investigating the case. In the kitchen sink, we found two wine glasses... ...soaked in soap water. It had no fingerprints. But we have found lipstick mark on one glass. This means the victim had liquor with a woman. Maybe he had wine with his wife. Oan't it be so? No. That is not possible. Victim was murdered at around 4:45. And at that time his wife was at the airport. She had just got down from Kolkata flight. And she was collecting her baggage from the baggage counter. But how can one still be sure that... ...the woman who had sex with him... ...and had drink with him committed that murder? Maybe there was another kind of sex? We have looked at that too! We are almost certain that a woman committed the murder... ...using a big dagger. He was stabbed thrice with the dagger. And all three attacks were not so strong... ...for a man to have done it. But that's notjust the problem. The problem is more serious. The killer has left a tell tale sign... that has dazed us. What! A swastik was drawn on the victim's head. Red swastik. Swastik drawn with his blood. Around 6 weeks ago, a man was murdered in similar manner. Swastik was drawn on his forehead too. Swastik drawn with his blood. That man too was a businessman. And he too had sex with a mysterious woman... ...in his wife's absence. What do you want from me? We want three things from you. Firstly tomorrow you have come to the crime branch... ...and again narrate your conversation with this woman. We want to record it. Secondly we have some suspects' recorded voices. We want you to hear that... and try to identify it. Thirdly... if this woman calls you again in the future... ...then record her call. We will install special equipments for that. Okay, gentlemen. Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay. And yes, Sarika. We would like to see the letter to the editor and that article... ...send by that mysterious caller. Okay. I will send the photocopy tomorrow itself. Thanks. - Good night! Okay. I will take this. Okay, ma'am. Please come. This way. Here, ma'am. - Thank you. What is in this bag, mama? It has a train, son. You like train a lot, don't you? Son, carefully! Mama! - Son! What happened, son? You got hurt? What happened, son? Hurt badly? My dear son! What do you people do? Taking money every month! You can't keep the compound clean! Things are scattered here and there. Whether children live or die, it doesn't make a difference! Let the secretary come in the evening! I will give him a hearing! Son, let's go home! Son, hang on. Mummy will pay the cab fare. Take 100 rupees. I don't have change. Keep it. No, you only have it. Thank you. Hello! - Thank you! Let's go, son! Oome on! Mummy, that last compartment! Hang on, son. Look... now this too is affixed. Now let's start the train! Wow! Ohikoo's train has started! Son, where is your train going? - To Delhi! Wow! Delhi! Look, the smoke! Wow! - Wow! Son, mama will get chips and coke. Then we both will watch TV together. Okay. Now it will go to Ahemdabad. Then Hyderabad. Then Kolkata. Then Delhi. It's boring! That's more boring! That's more boring! Okay, son. Have coke. That's more boring! Here. Have chips. Son, give the remote to mummy Mummy will quickly find your program. Yes, mummy! You only find it! Here! Have coke! Ma'am, you have been awarded with Women of the year... Behind your achievement... ...your long struggle has been honoured. That's not so. Time teaches everything. Yes. Time teaches everything. But you can't refute that during... ...such a time a woman breaks down... Your husband left you. But you didn't break down. I am not the only woman in this world. There are so many women who fight... ...with the situation and time. They fight their battle with fortitude. Yes! Yes! Ashley, I am doing just that. Just give me half an hour. It will be done. Okay. Don't worry! We will not miss the deadline! Okay! Yes, Ash. Now what do you want? Hello! Hello! - Yes! Sarika! Recognised me? Yes. Yes. Don't worry. I won't say anything to trouble you. Nothing special, Sarika. It's just a friendly call. Wanted to know how you are doing. How are you, Sarika? I am fine. Thank you. How are you? Not bad. How is your child, Sarika? Fine. She is fine. Isn't her name Anjali? She is a mentally challenged baby. Am I right? But she looks so cute! So lovely! How do you know so much about me? You are a nice woman, Sarika. I admire you. In fact... I consider you as my friend. And we should know about our friend. Don't be nervous, Sarika. I saw your old interview on the TV. I found out a lot about you through that. - Oh! You don't have to be afraid of me, Sarika. No. Why will I fear you? You are sitting in the AO. And still you are sweating. Hello! No, Sarika. I am not looking at you from anywhere. My six sense... sorry my sixth sense... ...has developed a lot due to hard times. Even you will agree that in women... ...six sense... sorry sixth sense is more developed. Yes. That is true. Do you know, Sarika... why I called you? To compliment you. To praise you for your strength. Being a single mother, the way you have raised your child... ...and in the society... in this male dominated society... ...the position that you have achieved... its worth praising. It deserves praise. Thank you. How shall I address you? You can call me your friend. Friends have a name too. Maybe I don't remember my name. You can call me by any name. What name should I give you? Anamika... orjust friend? You can call me both. Friend too... and Anamika too. Fine. Friend... and Anamika. Anamika friend. Just saying is not enough. When you have called me your friend, consider me as one. Okay. Then... don't you want to know... ...how unjust life has been with your friend? I have faced so many storms. I have endured so much. Still... I don't know how I am still alive. Had there been some other woman in my place... ...she would have died a long time ago. Look... I am willing to hear whatever you want to say. Why don't we meet and talk? I want to know everything about you. Everything. Give me your address. I will come there. Or else you come to my office. We will talk leisurely. Like friends. No! Where to meet and when, I will decide that! Not you! Yes! I do want to meet you. Fine! Let me guess! Maybe... you live in Khar area. Sarika, what do you think of me? I am a child? That you can use me the way you want. Listen to me carefully, Sarika. Don't even think of being smart with me. Don't ever... ever try to play games with me! Okay! Sarika, you know what kind of a woman I am! Don't you? Yes or no? Tell me, Sarika! Yes. Don't try to be smart with me, Sarika. The information that I don't want to give you... ...you can't make me spill that. Got it? Yes. - There was an assignment for you, for today. It is not possible today, today is my fast... ...and I have just finished my veneration. It is a very nice offer. I said no, on the day of veneration and fast... ...I don't accept any offers. Okay, what's your programme for tomorrow? Yes, we can think about tomorrow. Okay, then we will keep it for tomorrow. Where do I have come, at what time? Give me the address. Zeenat. I am... I am so sorry. Please, come in. Please. Take a seat. Be comfortable. Oh, yes! Drinks. Will do. Hardly-hardly or... softly-softly? I don't take hard drinks. Then, what in soft drinks?

Her eyes were speaking, and spreading it's magic. I was lost in the magic, I became out of control And you became my destiny, you are my You are my aim. With ten reasons he stole my heart. He stole my heart. With ten reasons he stole my heart. He took my heart. So Rohan sir is sitting here. What are you doing here? Make another circle here I will go away, first you correct this.

Look, look here catch the pencil like this... ...and make a circle like this. Hi, Ohaudhary sir you here. Ms. Sarika, wonderful. I should have thought you could be here. How is that? I have your tape of the conversation with that girl. And then I saw your interview. You are incredible. Really. - Thank you. But you... why are you here? I have some relation with him, I will tell you some other time. Oh I see. Did you find out anything about that girl? No. Her voice, does not match with any of the recordings... ...of the other women that we have. Seems like she doesn't have a police record till now. But we are searching. We are still searching. All over the country in all the headquarters... ...wherever we have voice mails, we are searching there. Yes Rohan, tell me are you finished. Okay Ohaudhary sir, I will take your leave. - Okay. Bye. - Say bye to aunt. Bye. - Love you. - Bye. - Love you. Oh God, flying kiss. Bye. - Love you. Good that Tannu didn't come today. She was busy herself so she sent you. The truth is that, there is a lot ofjoy in your company. The feeling is something very different. Whoever spends some time with you... is finished. Even I have met a lot of men in my life... But to tell the truth... ...you are the best. I want to change my drink. I feel like drinking beer. Even I can drink beer. I would love to join you. That's nice there is beer in our suite. I will get it. You wait, I will get it for and me. Thank you, I will go to the washroom. I will be back in a minute. - Okay. No Sarika, I cannot see you from you anywhere. Just my six sense... sorry sixth sense, has developed a lot... ...because of a lot of cruelty. And you will agree to, that we women... ...have a very developed six sense... sorry sixth sense. Yes, that's right. I cannot see you from you anywhere. Just my six sense... sorry sixth sense, has developed a lot. ...because of a lot of cruelty. Just my six sense... sorry sixth sense, has developed a lot. ...because of a lot of cruelty. And you will agree to, that we women... ...have a very developed six sense... sorry sixth sense. Yes, that's right. Hi Sarika, how are you? This is your friend speaking, Anamika. How are you? Good. Sarika, I have a news for you. Breaking news, breaking news, breaking news. Another murder in the hotel in the city. The murderer killed another one. Breaking news, another murder in the hotel of the city. Brother. Breaking news, another murder in the hotel of the city. Swastik Killing. Bloody Red Swastik. Shall I tell you something Ms. Sarika. I really wish, I really wish that this woman... ...makes a swastika on one the people writing the headlines. That would really make me very happy. You have... become really emotional. - I am sorry. Sir, I feel confident that now it won't take much time... ...to find this woman. How can you say that? Sir, she has started to come out in the open a bit... ...I mean in the hotels etcetera. It will become very easy for us to corner her. Yeah, but even then Ranade... ...she is always two steps ahead of us... ...so that we can't catch her. And after that either she calls from the victims cell phone... ...or from his landline. She doesn't use her own phone. Even this time, she hasn't used the hotels phone... ...she used the victims cell phone. Bloody clever woman. But sir, the important thing is that's she does call... ...as if she has some personal competition with Ms. Sarika. This arrogance of her, this will get her caught. Ms. Sarika, can you do something. Look, this time her recording proves that... ...she is very angry with your magazine. As if she... she wants to show you... ...how powerful she is, what she is capable of doing. I was thinking that too. I thinking... I will have to do something. I was thinking of preparing a special article. And I will include the important parts of her letter... ...as a reference. Maybe that will calm her down a bit. That's a good idea. I think that's a very good idea. I think this way you can establish a relation... ...with her of a sympathiser. We might be able to reach her Ranade. I also agree with this sir. I think it is a very good idea. I think lets get down to work. Absolutely. - Thank you. Madam please move you car, you are blocking my way. I am sorry, I am really sorry... ...I didn't see that you were reversing you car. I just had to make a call from that POO. But anyway, never mind. I will just move my car. Okay, okay. That's alright. - One moment. I am sorry, I am really sorry... ...I didn't see that you were reversing you car. I just had to make a call from that POO. But anyway, never mind, I just move my car. Oh my God, that was the same women. You fool, move. - Okay, okay. Her eyes sir, I wouldn't have been able to recognise her. But her deep dark blue eyes; they were too striking to miss. Did you see that woman go to that room... ...where the murder was committed. How can I say that sir, I only went till the 7th floor... ...whereas that woman got off at the 6th floor. But today, when I saw her dressed differently... ...I couldn't recognise her. Oan you do one thing for us Mr. Dhar? Tell me. We have some voice recordings... ...and photos etcetera of some women. Oan you try to recognise them, please? Sure sir. Sir. - Take sir to Pawar in the identification library... ...and tell Sawant to be ready to go with me. - Okay sir. Okay, thank you Mr. Dhar. - Thank you sir. And please Mr. Dhar, we don't have a resembling photo... ...of this women in our banks. So can you come again tomorrow? So that you can help the sketch artist to draw her face. Of course. - Okay Mr. Dhar. Hello. - Yes? - We want to meet your madam. We have come from the election campaign. We just want to giver her a pamphlet and talk to her. Just wait here, I will call her. Why did you tell them, that I am at home? I made a mistake. - You are... All right. How do they look? Very nice, they seem to be nice people. Make them sit inside, give them water. I am coming. - Okay. Oome Ms. Shehnaz, take a seat. How do you know my name? We don'tjust know your real name... ...but your business name too. Tannu, its right isn't it. We understand, people often change their names... ...for their business. Especially for the business, in which you are involved. I didn't understand what you mean. You will understand it, you will understand it... ...Ms. Shehnaz Karim alias Rani alias Tannu alias Nina. To entertain the clients in your buisiness... ...you are not known by your name Shehnaz... ...but the by the names of Tannu, Rani and Nina, isn't it. What are you al talking about? Shehnaz, this mask of a respected woman... ...that you are trying to wear, take it off... ...and show your real self. Because we know your reality very well. What do you know? And who are you? You don't seem to be election people. Who are you? We are police. Okay, you are the police then what have I done? Don't try to act smart. Sawant, tell her what charges we are pressing against her. What do you want from me? You are involved in a very serious matter Shehnaz. In a murder. - Murder. What are you saying inspector sir? You very well know what I am saying Shehnaz. Not only did you know Mr. Bose for a long time... ...but the day he was murdered... ...you talked to him on the phone in the morning, twice. First he called you from his mobile phone. And then you, called him back from your mobile phone. And as far as I think you didn't ask him about the weather... ...or discuss about the problems of water and pollution. Yes, yes but... I didn't know that man... ...and that was the first and last call that he had made. That day. And I don't even know that he has been murdered. Look Shehnaz, you are a part of the prostitution racket... ...we know that. We even know that Mr. Sudhansu Bose... ...who was a resident of 373 Shakesperes Serene, Kokata -3. Was a senior executive in air cool appliances. You have entertained him 6 times in the last 8 months. We have the records of your every meeting. Not only can we arrest you for prostitution under the immoral act... ...but we can arrest you under the suspicion of Mr. Bose's murder. Then you are finished. Now will you tell us the truth... ...or shall I call the half a dozen police officials in the van... ...outside, to arrest you. And yes, we have a lady police with us too. Don't worry at all. Ask, what you want to ask. Hello. - Hi Sarika, did you recognise me? You, on my mobile. How did you get my number? From your office, they are very nice people. You were not there, so I asked for your cell number. They gave it, why didn't you like it? No, no there is nothing like that. Tell me, how are you? I am well, I am very well. In fact I am very happy. Oh, is it? How come, what happened? I just saw your magazine issue in the mall... ...I even read the article that you wrote. I liked it a lot. What? You even read it in the mall. Yes, of course you are my friend... ...and if I won't read my friends article first... ...then who else will. I quickly paid my shopping bill, and while drinking a coffee... ...a read the article. Now you are talking. Now you have realised the struggle of a single mother... ...their pain. Your writing is really powerful, thank you very much. I am so happy, that you liked the article. You are a mother, that's why you could write... ...such a good article, such a touching article. Sometimes I thought, am I writing all this. You are a mother too, you have taken care of your son alone. In a way, you are the writer of this article too. How is your son? My son... yes, my son is fine. My son is fine. I don't know why, he is not always with me. He should always be with his mother, isn't it? Sometimes he just wanders off somewhere. Then... then he comes back again. I am so strange, isn't it? He will have to go to his school. I will have to stay away from him that long. I can understand. Look Anamika, if you want to talk something more... ...with me, then you can. I can meet you too. If you are in a shopping mall close by, then I can come right now. In which shopping mall are you? Oh Sarika you are the limit. You want to see me. Please listen to me... Good bye Sarika. Sarika. - Ohaudhary sir, you. What's the matter? Are you fine, Ms. Sarika? You are scared as if you have seen a ghost. I am sorry, just like that... That woman had called on my mobile. What are you saying, show me. This number is of this area. What? - Yes. Yeah, yeah everything is fine. It is engaged. You come with me please, come. Yes tell me Yadav. From this shopping mall. When? Are you sure? Yes, yes, yes there is a West Side showroom on the other side. Oh God. Then... You investigate. You investigate it, and I am going to the headquarters. Okay. And listen, did you contact Ranade? The battery is down, okay, okay bye. I don't believe this? What happened? The number from which that woman called you from... ...that is from this shopping mall. And the biggest thing, where you were standing... ...and talking to her, that was about 12-15 metres away from her. I mean, everything can be seen clearly from there... ...she might have seen you too. - My God. I will have to go, why don't you come with me too. It will be helpful if you go over the whole conversation... ...once again at the headquarters. Okay. - Oome. Oh God. Hello! Hello! Lift, please. Hello, please, please. Sorry sir, can you drop till an auto or a taxi. There is nothing around here. Okay, come. Thank you, thank you so much. Give me, I will keep it behind. Sorry, I had to trouble you. My car broke down. I couldn't find a transport around... ...so I had to walk, with the hope that... ...if I would find a transport... ...then I can bring a mechanic show him my car. Sorry, I don't know anything about cars... ...I know only how to drive. Otherwise I would have helped you Never mind, I have locked the car. If I don't find a mechanic now... ...then I will bring someone in the morning and show him. Where do you want to go? Right here. Thanks a lot, that's so kind of you... ...you had to come out of the way for me. Thank you so much Mr... - Ranade, Sunil Ranade. Nice to meet you, I am Smita. Hi! - Would you like to come up for a cup of tea or coffee? No. No. Thanks a lot. It is very late. Some other day. Okay, thank you so much. Ms. Smita. - Yes. Your bags. - Oh, you are completely drenched... God! How silly of me? Now you will have to drink a coffee. No, no please don't bother. How is that possible, you are drenched because of me! You cannot go like this, please. Well, okay. Never heard that before. I will leave I took a lot of your time. Never mind, I am at home. Your clothes. Never mind about that, whenever you feel convenient... ...you can bring them back. But, won't you need them. No, not really. Never mind. If possible, I will return it tomorrow evening, after... Thank you, I will keep your clothes ready. Good night. - Good night. Sarika! Hang on! Wait there! Sarika, when you were talking on the phone... ...you were here, weren't you? Yes. - Stand here! Mark this place! - Yes, sir! Morning, sir! - Morning! Sir! - Good morning! What happened? Anything materialised? Sir, we are trying. Something will happen sooner or later. Good morning, Sarika. - Morning. So we disturbed you too early in the morning. Not a problem. In a way it's my duty. But what to do? I don't remember. About that day's activities. I think Ranade's re-enactment idea flopped because of me. God! I mean this is... this is like... ...so near and yet so far! I mean I think that woman is nearby only. Still we can't recognise her! It means as soon as we reach to her, she escapes. Now look, you said that Shehnaz had spoken to her. She said to entertain that man... Mr. Bose... ...whom she later murdered. Still we can't reach to her. I mean... isn't this strange? Sir, Shehnaz told us that she can contact... ...Zeenat only when Zeenat wants. She herself calls her and that too from her cell. She has prepaid SIM cards. And she frequently changes her number. In this call girl business, don't they meet each other? Doesn't Shehnaz know where Zeenat, Anamika... ...or whatever she calls herself lives? I don't understand this. We have made all the enquiries. Shehnaz told us that because they are in the same business... ...they just know each other. They are not friends. Strange! Sir, Shehnaz also told us that she met... ...Zeenat for the first time in a dispensary. When they both were waiting for their turn to meet the doctor. Zeenat was dressed up normally. And Shehnaz was richly dressed up. Seeing Zeenat's financial condition... ...Shehnaz gave her the offer of entertaining the customers... ...and thus earning abundant money. Zeenat needed money. And she got trapped. Did you find out about Zeenat from the doctor? Her details, her address etc? No, sir. Sir, our team found out that... ...Zeenat has changed her doctor and her residence. Oh! Are we back to square one? No, sir. We have found out something else about her. That doctor said that he had referred Zeenat... ...whose real name is Rohini Mathur to a physiatrist. Because she suffered from nervous breakdown. Nervous breakdown? And that physiatrist? Sir, her name is Shanta Rekki. And she is not in town. She has gone abroad. We still have to meet her. You... you have to get this woman to me as soon as possible! Got it, Ranade! Believe me, sir! I am at it! Hi! You! Sorry, I came at this hour. But the work didn't get over till 8:00-8:30.

Only 8:45. Hey! I have seen this shirt somewhere. Is it that I had worn it yesterday? Possible. Now if you will leave your shirt carelessly... ...on the stairs... then somebody has to take care of it. Shall I tell you something? You are looking very sexy in this shirt. - Is that right? How sexy? Tea. - Wait! What happened? Go right in! I have kept a new toothbrush! Wow! What a tea! - Have biscuit! Wow! Shrewberry! How do you know that Shrewberry is my favourite biscuit? What do you think? I have six sense... I am sorry sixth sense. I found out through that. Does your sixth sense works more in food matters? Notjust in food matters... in other mattes too... ...my six sense... sorry sixth sense is highly developed! I think you really believe in sixth sense. Of course I do. Anybody will admit that in women... ...six sense... sorry sixth sense is more developed. And because of this six sense... sorry sixth sense... ...we know about many important things beforehand. What happened? Nothing! I was thinking about your six sense... sorry sixth sense! O God! Phone call! It had to ring now only! The extension of this room doesn't work. I will have to go down. Till then you think about this six sense... sorry sixth sense. I will go and attend the phone call. Six sense. Sorry. Sixth sense. 'No, Sarika. I am not looking at you from anywhere.' 'My six sense... sorry my sixth sense... ...has developed a lot due to hard times.' 'Even you will agree that in women... ...six sense... sorry sixth sense is more developed.' Oh my God! Sunil! - Yes, ma'am! Sorry, darling! So sorry! Sorry! It took so long! Would you mind if I have a quick shower before making breakfast? Fine. Anything is fine. Sure you don't mind? - Not at all! Oatch! Pick up the phone! Oome on! Oome on! Oome on! Sunil! Would you like to join me in the shower? Would you? Yes! Yes! Oonnect me to Mr. Ohaudhary! Please! Quickly! Sunil! Yes, sir! I am absolutely sure, sir! Sir, she is the same woman! Sir, I found out from the recording... ...of her conversation with Sarika! Sir, many of her words matches with that. And sir, she even has blue colour contact lens! Yes! Yes! Okay, sir! I will inform him! Okay, sir! Sir, quickly arrange for the force! Bye, sir! Sawant, it's me! Listen to me carefully. Get me to the commando of the flying squad immediately! Yeah! Hello! Hello! Sarika! I had called you! I have news for you. Okay, Kamat! Quickly! Smita! Smita! Smita! I think she ran away! Smita! You are taking a shower here? Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! What is going on? What the hell is going on? Will somebody tell me what we are doing? Sir... we are trying our best! - What? Do you all know? What all I had to face today? What all things I had to hear... in front of Ohief Minister... ...and Home Minister about my profession. Now look, gentlemen. I must tell you. If we didn't nab this woman soon... ...then we all are finished. We will be transferred to such places... ...compared to which hell will be better. Our best detectives are spread all over the city, sir. And I am sure something will materialise soon. Sunil Ranade too was one of your best detectives. The same mark was found on his forehead. Red swastik. Isn't it, Ohaudhary? I am very sorry about that, sir. Gentlemen, I have been given only 10 days by the OM! And I can give you all only 7 days. And I want this woman within 7 days! Either dead or alive! Do you all understand? Sir! This is my city. And nobody messes up things here. Not even this woman. Is that clear? Yes, sir! - Sir! That's all, officers! Your city is a strange city. Your city is a strange city. Here relationships are based on deceit. Dawn and dusk. Your city is a strange city. Your city is a strange city. Gold mesmerizes people. Oolourful dreams too change. Gold mesmerizes people. Oolourful dreams too change. Still love stories are found in books. In books. Your city is a strange city. I think you didn't bring your car. No, I came by cab. - Oome. I will drop you. Red swastik on another police officer's forehead. What a woman! How is sister-in-law? - Better than before. Found out anything about Rohini from physiatrist Shanta Rekki? As expected. She refused to give any information. Norms of confidentiality! Hell! Norms of confidentiality! If you... permit, I can do something. - What? If the door is closed, then it might not be wrong to gain... ...entrance through the backdoor or the window. I don't understand. Our magazine is more into investigative journalism. Many times we have to use shady ways to know the truth. We have to do different kind of spying. If you give the permission, I can try to extract information. You... will you be able to do it? I have the perfect weapon for it. - Let's shoot. Yes, ma'am. Hi! I am Nikita Burman. I have an appointment with Dr. Shanta Rekki. Please take your seat. I will inform her. Thank you! - Please! - Thank you! Ma'am, Ms. Nikita Burman is here to see you. Okay, ma'am. Good! Impeccable references! You can begin the work anytime. Even from today. From today? Fine. I will start from today. But only after lunch. Fine. After lunch. But frankly I think if you can work in the evening, it will be better. Before I leave for London, it has to be updated on the computer. The entire programming is to be prepared. If you will do it after surgery timings... ...it will be convenient for you. There won't be any disturbance. What do you say? Fine. It suits me even better. - Good! Here. Oath of confidentiality. Sign on it. - Fine. Sir, I have given madam the morning dose... ...she is sleeping. Before leaving, would you have to like a cup of tea? I was going to make one. Okay, you sit I will make it. Then he will come, and give you a kiss... ...then give you a nice dress, then you will go in the sky, there. Then mama will say thief has come, okay. Sleep my darling. Hello. - Hello Sarika. Sarika, won't you say hello? Are you switching on the recorder? Do it, no matter do it. But say something. Anyway, don't talk to me. But I will always consider you my friend... ...I will keep telling you all my secrets. Other than you, I cannot share this with anyone else. In fact and in short, you are lucky. Before I do anything, you become the witness... ...to my plans. Don't you thing, that your existence... ...has become very important these days. What do you call them, the fore-tellers... ...The one that can take a peek in the future. Future-tellers. You have become like them. You can say in advance, what is going to happen. Then here again this time become the fore-teller. Something is going to happen. I am going to do something again. I have found my next prey. Look... Listen to me Anamika... - And listen Sarika. Now whether you like it or not... ...you will have to publish my story... ...and my article in your magazine. Okay, but... - Good bye Sarika. Because I was very scared. - Who were you scared of? What shall I say madam, I am very poor man. I have children. - Here, keep it. No, what will I do with this I have already taken enough. No matter, keep it. Now that you are saying, I will keep it. Do you recognise this madam? This is Rohini madam. In Swapna Shakti. - Swapna... - In my building She lives in flat number 4. Really, what kind of a woman is she? I mean what do you know about this woman? Madam, this Rohini madam is a bit crazy. She is a very strange woman. She behaves strangely. She talks strangely. What does she do? She lives alone, she doesn't have a friend... And no one even comes in her house. She talks about her son, she loves him a lot. Whereas madam, no one has seen her son till now. Really, what does she talk about her son? Madam, why shall I hide it from you. Some days ago, she came home in a taxi. Son carefully. Son! What happened son, did you fall down? Did you get hurt badly? What do the society people do? They take money for free! They don't even keep the compound clean. Things are lying scattered around here and there! But it doesn't make a difference to anyone. Let the secretary come in the evening... ...I will teach him a lesson! Oome on son, come let us go home. Just a minute son, mama will pay the taxi and come. Here, take this 100 rupees. - I don't have change, you keep it. No, you keep it. Thank you. - Hello. - Thank you. Oome on son, come on. This Rohini Madam, notjust a bit... ...she is completely mad and very suspecting. Many times she calls the security in her flat... ...and says that her child is playing downstairs... ...and it is getting very late, bring him up. She keeps bringing... what do you call that... ...noodles, chocolate and many other things. Madam, whereas she doesn't have a son. Strange isn't it? What can I say madam. Many a times, she disappears from her house... ...no one knows where she goes. And then suddenly she returns again. Madam, these days too she is out of her house for many days. Okay. Thank you, you have helped me a lot. Thank you, bye. Her 4-5 year old son died in a dreadful accident. That's why somewhere deep inside her heart... ...there is a feeling of losing everything. And that's why she lives in an illusion. In a imaginary world. She feels that her son is with her. Oh, that's why she always used to talk about her son. Right. Right. Ms. Sarika I had told you, whenever in her articles... ...or even when she talks whenever she talks about her child... ...her feelings sound so unreal. Yes, I have read about such cases. In doctor Reiki's clinic, I have read in her file... ...that she has faced many more dreadful tragedies in her life. She loved someone, they were about to get married too. Oome on, you are my would be wife... ...they had gone on a picnic, and while returning... ...some people attacked them. Look, what he is doing to the girl. Oome on, come on. What nonsense, what is this misbehaviour. What are you all doing? What are you doing? Leave him, leave him. Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Leave me! Leave me! Abhi! Later, his would-be husband left him too. His husband knew, that she is pregnant with his child. He said, that after a gang rape... ...his family will never accept her. And whose child is this, who is the father... ...questions will be raised on that too. And their relation will never prosper. And this will never turn out to be a beautiful relation. The dreadful incidents that this woman... ...has faced in her life. It must have been difficult for her to control herself. The biggest tragedy of this woman's life is... ...her son's death. That her conscious mind cannot accept. And that's why, she starts living that imaginary life... ...in which her son is with her. Atleast there is someone whom she can call her own. Yes, that's what she said on the phone. Good that your daughter is with you. There is someone that's yours. She always lives in her imaginary world. She thinks that her imagination is real. It seems real. There are some people, that's she can see ruining her life. She takes revenge from them. And while killing them, she doesn't feel... She thinks that she is doing justice. Yes Shyam say. Yes. Okay. What? As a nurse. Surely. You are there, right. Okay. Okay, I will see. And listen. You remain there. Ladies, we have a break through. All stations, confirm APIP. Alfa to romeo, APIP sir. Over. - Good. Over and out. APIP, meaning. All persons in place. I see. It's a BIN, I repeat B I N. It's a BIN, over and out. Attention all personals, it's a BIN. I repeat it's a BIN. Go head, best of luck. Over and out. Yes BIN, B I N. Bird in the nest. Roger Zebra, headquarter to Nuclear. It is a B I N, I repeat. It is a B I N. Roger. Our personals are ready in plain clothes. If everything goes fine, then 15 minutes. In 15 minutes our secret operation will be over. And the bird will be caught. Bird? - Notjust a bird, deadly bird. Hi dear. Your drink. You wanted me to make it, so here it is. Exactly the way you want to. Wow, half a drink for you and a full glass for me. That will not do. I cannot drink much during the day, that's why. Half a drink for you and a full glass for me. Oheers. - Oheers. Hello Rohini. Inspector Sawant, mid-west police station. And she is assistant police inspector Ashu Kumar... ...in your service. Freeze! Rohini! Good bye inspector Sawant. Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir she committed suicide. 'Now whether you like it or not... ...you will have to publish my article.' The torn shreds tell the pages. Life wanders around here. The torn shreds tell the pages. Life wanders around here. In the manors and the monuments. It wanders around Ionely in the paths. Joyfully wanders around. Your city, is a strange city. Subtitles by: Rajesh S. Kumar
