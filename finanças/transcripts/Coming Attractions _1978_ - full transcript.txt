He's studying the law to better himself, and hopefully get himself out of this god-forsaken, inhuman man-made hell of concrete and steel. It's just too bad he killed a judge. (steam hissing) - It's all set, 3:51 tonight, pass it on! - It's all set for 3:51 tonight. I go to the chair at 5:30! - We're busting out of this joint! We dug a tunnel! - Sam you dug a tunnel? Wonderful! Where? - Do you, do you mind if I give it a try? - Sam, where is the fucking tunnel? - Excuse me Lefty, the warden has a message for you. (Sam humming) - Hold on a second. (coin jingling) - Thank you Lefty. - Dear Lefty, please give my wife your recipe for stroganoff. We are entertaining the governor, and some members of the press. We're planning to stay up and watch the execution. Also, would you recommend a good wine? The warden. - There, your shirt is all finished, it's beautiful ah?

We're having roast tomorrow, and the missus was wondering if you wouldn't mind holding this, huh? - Warden wait, is there any word from the governor? - Uh, too much paprika, but he liked it. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - Did anybody ever find out where that tunnel was? Did anybody? ♫ So I say, it's a gray town ♫ It's a wonderful town ♫ It's the kind of a town I admire ♫ Da-Doot en do-do-do. (honking) (whistling) (slapping) (singing) - One, two, three, four!

Duddy Allen in The Sneaker. - I wish I knew what it is I'm doing wrong! I went out and I bought new clothes. I didn't bath or shave for days. I did everything you told me and Louise still won't take me back! - Now see here kid! You gotta stop trying to be like me, it won't work. - Yeah but you, you always had women falling all over themselves just to get to you! They'd kill for you. They probably all fuck like bunnies on their first date, huh? - Now who is this you're talking about? - You, Clark Gable! - I'm not Clark Gable! - You're not? - Hell no! God are you a shit! - Who are you? - Sid Ronkowski! - Sid Ronkowski? Why have I been taking advice from you all this time? Why didn't you just say something? I thought you were my fantasy, my idol! - I don't know. You came by this spot one day and started talking out loud, asking a bunch of stupid-ass questions, I was off taking a leak in the bushes and overheard you. I thought I'd help you out! - You look amazingly like Clark Gable. It's uncanny. - You think so? - Really. - No! Anyway, I can't wait to hear, did you call Louise on the phone like I told you to? - She cut off her phone service. - Oh, that, I... Have you tried dating other women? - Last night. - Hmm? - Margie. - Good, how did it go? - I don't know, I thought we had a good time. So I really can't say that existential nihilism is the only way to go. Personally, that is for me, I tend to lean toward Zen with Zionist tendencies. (mumbles) do a thorough study of the neo-platonic relationship of chlorophyll to Retsin. In other words everything is predestined to Chicago or New York. Subjunctive subjectivity on the other hand tells us, that within the realm of eternal halitosis, and the softer as duplicity of nature, we're all one and one for all. (chuckles) I uh, I practice transcontinental meditation, and, have found new morality, and insights into... (snoring) - Guy comes in he says "Bartender start 'em up "for everybody on me!" He says "What about me?" He says "Forget it, when you drink you get nasty!" (laughing) - Louise! (gasping) Louise! I gotta talk to you! - Duddy! Once and for all will you please go away and leave me alone, we are through! Over, ended, finished, psst! That's it! - Gee I was hoping for something more definite. (groaning) - Honey, would you let me take care of it please? - You talking to me? I don't see anybody else around, you must be talking to me! Let me tell you something, these hands are registered with UCLA! Oh boy! Hey, hey I'd really like to, but I just remembered, I uh, I ate and I have to wait an hour, I could get cramped! (gasps) Nice cologne, that musk? (chuckling) (screaming) (water splashing) - [Narrator] When Duddy's wife won't take him back, (comical music) what's this, he resorts to drugs! For three hours Duddy turns into a used car salesman. - Yoo-hoo, yes, you you schmuck, look at this! $52,000 I'll give you a car, what a car! We're wheelin' we're dealin' here! Terrific, you, pop, come here, look at this! We're gonna cover the windshield, big tires! (mumbling) So anyway my mother threw me out of the house when I was 3 1/2, I've never been the same since. - Hey kid, you talk too damn much! Put your hands on her, take her bra off! - Okay, but I'm not too good at this kind of thing. - Yeah that's it, don't be shy! Touch her tit! Go on, touch it! - Do you want to hear my moose story, I-- - God damn it you ineffectual pipsqueak! I'd be going down on her by now! Go down on her! - No I can't do that! - Go on, go down on her! - No no, (mumbles). - Go down on her god dammit! - It's our first date! Do you want to go to a Tupperware party (mumbles)?

(serene music) - In the middle of North-Central Asia, virtually untouched by commerciality, lies the newest chic playground of the international, smart set! A breathtaking journey to the lower regions of beautiful Mongolia, brings us face to face with the mystery and magic of the Gobi! Come with us now as we walk down the ancient boulevard of the gods, in this 500,000-square mile desert resort community! (wind howling) A gentle ocean breeze ruffles our hair, as we tour this huge, undeveloped plateau. Formerly a barren desert, the Gobi was turned into the empire and thriving metropolis that we see today, through the inspired leadership of Genghis Khan, way back in the 13th century. The national bird of the Gobi is the friendly, outgoing vulture. (vulture cawing) This beautiful intelligent bird can be trained to sit on your head on command. (engine starter grinding) Wildlife abounds in the lush vegetation. This is a true paradise. (coughing) The shifting, whispering sands uncover many a tale of intrigue, and tell us much of the lifestyle of the ancients. And like the blowing sands, we too must move on, and uncover more mysteries and magic of other playgrounds of the world. Taking leave of our newly made friends, and their quaint food-free diets, it is time to wave a tearful farewell to the magic of the Gobi! (dramatic music) (tranquil music) - Hello, I'm Buddy Hackett, and I've been asked to speak to you on behalf of an organization known as, S-T-O-P-I-T, STOPIT, or the Society to Oppress and Prevent Involuntary Tinkling. It's a totally non-profit institution. As national chairperson this year, (water splashing) I decided to pay a visit to the institute. Here on the grounds of their main facility in Watertown, New York, we see many of the cures being tried to stop the flood. One of the newest and most effective methods they're using here at STOPIT, is negative reinforcement training. Now let's listen in. - (mumbles) How many times do I have to tell you, you big sissy, you're nothing, you big baby! Do you know what a disappointment you are to your mother and father? If I had a hammer-- - Pardon me but aren't you being a bit rough on him? - What's it to you Mac? The kid won't stop pissing! What are you, a piss freak or something? - Hello again. Now this is Robert, isn't it? Can you tell everyone out there, why you're here with us today. Well it's because you're the STOPIT poster boy for this year, isn't that right? Well, Bob is well on his way to becoming a normal healthy young man, all due to the never-ending work of STOPIT, right Bobby? (splattering) Right now, theater ushers are starting to move up this theater's aisles, with tin cups that will soon be pissed, er, passed down your row. When that cup of kindness reaches you, I hope you will find it in your hearts to reach way in and pull out whatever you can to deposit in the cup! Do it for the kids or do it for yourself! You'll feel relieved that you did! Thanks.

I'll see you'all, have a good time! Hey Jim Bob, wait up over there, you old shit kicker you! (laughing) (sobbing) - [Narrator] How much more could two people take? (dramatic music) Terrified, hungry, tired, sleepy, but they dare not drop their guard! Something must be wrong. Why else were these people so nice, so kind to them? - Oh baby! (engine rumbling) (screaming) (dramatic music) - How you doing this morning? (giggling) (perky country music) Bye! - [Narrator] Some day you may find yourself in some small town where everyone is ever so nice to you! Welcome to Bacon County! - You'all come back, okay? Bye!

Central! - [Narrator] Yes they're back, those three all-American boys who rah-rahed their way into your hearts in the Pom Pom Boys, and have they ever got problems! - Boy you sure look great! Hey how's the team feeling about the big Girl's Basketball game coming up with Hamilton High? - (groans) Not very good Warren (chuckles). Oh Betty's got this knee, and without her I just don't see how we're gonna stand a chance against their big center, Zelda. - Yeah, she scored 27 even with Betty playing last year. - I'm aware of that. - What you need? I wish there was some way we guys could help. - Maybe there is one, (chuckles) maybe there is! - Well what is it Ann, for god's sake tell me, please! - Well it has been rumored, that the only thing big Zelda loves to do more than stuff a ball in the hoop, is to stuff something else somewhere else. - You mean-- - A little sex (chuckles)! That's it you know, sex. I mean if you boys could manage to tire Big Zelda out tonight, maybe she wouldn't be so formidable tomorrow. - I don't know Ann, I'll have to talk to the guys. I'll call you later. - Thanks Warren. Now remember, it's for the whole school, and especially me. - [Warren] I'll see 'ya, I'll call 'ya later. Bye! - [Narrator] All season long they had rooted their team home, could they get it up for one more game? - Well I vote we do it. I mean after all, it is the game of the season, we owe it to the girls. - Ah, okay count me in. - Me too. - All right. - I'm taking a shower. - [News Announcer] Where it's once again Jamar versus Bill Waltman, Kareem versus the Mountain Man, last year-- (festive music) - [Narrator] Each gave his all for the team and then gave it again, and then again, and then again. - [Zelda] Hey get in here, I want more, you get in here! (cheerful music) - Start the car! (engine rumbling) - [Narrator] Were they successful? Find out soon when the Pop Pom Boys returns to a theater near you! (heavenly music) (dramatic music) (rattling) (tense music) - [Narrator] Confused, Billy seeks guidance from the wisdom of the ancients. He returns to his power place for a rendezvous with the spirits. (rattling) (whip snapping) - Ah! (dramatic music) - Thanks mister, you just saved us from the wicked bitch of the North by Southwest! - You mean witch. - This witch was a real bitch! Come on! (cheerful music) - When in Oz... To hell with it. Howdy. Say can you tell us how to get to Emerald City? - Emerald City, aw shucks, you don't want to go to Emerald City. Ah well I mean it used to be a nice place to go, back 30, 40 years ago maybe, but not now, hell no! They got people living there five to a hut! They got smog like you wouldn't believe, and whatever you do, don't drink the water! - No shit? - No shit. Oh, ah hey would you two fellers maybe give me a hand here? - Boy, he's well hung isn't he? (cheerful music) - That's it, that's it, good! - Oil can, oil can! - Boy, I feel a whole lot better now! (chuckles) I'm stuffed! Well, thanks Billy, and thank you shorty! - Shorty? Did I just hear you call that midget shorty? When I hear somebody call a friend of mine shorty, or pygmy, or shrimp or half-pint or-- - Billy! - or Billy, or tiny, or teeny tiny, anyway, when I hear words like that, words filled with hate, and reeking with a total lack of respect for the simple, basic god-given innate dignity of mankind, well I... Oh sure he's short, (mumbles), literally, yeah he's even teeny tiny maybe, but when I see injustice perpetrated, when I see such a total lack of regard for even these silly, insignificant little squirts, then I go fucking crazy! (rustling) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] And now this theater is proud to present the first all talking, all singing, all brown, musical short, Dark Town, After Dark. (lazy jazz music) (thunder rumbling) (wind howling) - Hey Calvin, I want you to pass these around to the guys, a little something I wrote up on the way over here.
