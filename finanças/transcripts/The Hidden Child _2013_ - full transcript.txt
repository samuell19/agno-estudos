Preacher based on a novel by Camilla L?ckberg Good morning, darling! The paper's on about the pike again. -Haven't you gone yet? -I'll stay and take care of you. I still haven't got anything to do. Ernst and G?sta just sit on their buts. "Food Administration recommends pregnant women not eat ..." "High mercury content has been detected in freshwater fish." "One should be particularly cautious with pike." Where can I get the pike in Fj?llbacka? Can I do anything more. I can imagine a number of things I'd recommend you to do. I have the support of the NFA, Health & Welfare, Writers' Union. Hell! - Hello? Patrik Hedstr?m. Hey! Shall we hope prank calls hold off for nine months? -because you're going to be a father. -What do we know about her? 25 years old. Badly beaten. Waste of such a beautiful girl. -Has she been here long? -Maximum one day. -Is she from here? -Don't know. The handbag's been ransacked. Then we have a sex murderer loose. She wasn't here to pick bluebells. It's dangerous to go out now a days. There are two sketelons here! There goes the weekend. Just before the salmon season. The forensic report probably won't be available before the end of the week. -Check out old missing persons. -No new reports have been received. Here he comes. Hands off! I'm not gay! You are familiar with what happened in Fj?llbacka? Clearly, fucking evil! But let's talk about the killings now. Check out all the people living nearby. Somebody must have heard or seen something. The guy found them at 6 in the morning ... -How can a broken leg hurt so much? -Maybe it's phantom pains. Phantom pains? Get out and knock on doors, everyone! You have to take over for a while. Call me when the autopsy's received. Annika! Call a cab. I have to check if they plastered the wrong leg. -The famous writer! - Hey, big guy! -Hey, Colin. It's been a while. -Hey! We've just finished reading your book. -Damn! -Can you autograph it? -Absolutely. Do you want coffee? A quick snack would be nice. -Is it twins? -No. It's a football player. - Kids, come and feel! Feel there, Lisa. What does the father say? I remember when my snotty kids were born. Oh, what a to do. -Look around a bit while I set the table. -It will be okay. You've got it nice here. Sea view and everything. Have you found anything? Two women disappeared in Fj?llbacka in the 70s. -Siv Lantin, Midsummer '79. 19 years. That's right. Who was the other? Mona T?rnblad, 18. Great goings-on, search parties and dog teams. -Sorry, no traces? -Yes. Siv's bicycle was found in a ditch. -And a pair of shoes,probably Mona's. -Any suspects? Johannes Hult. -His brother testified against him? -Yes. They had an ongoing feud. Gabriel saw Johannes with one of girls the same night she disappeared. No evidence was found. Johannes later committed suicide. -A relative of the preacher? -Ephraim was their father. He travelled around, preached and healed people. Grandma used to scare me with him. Imagine having a father like that. Good, Annika! Find out more about the family feud. We will knock on doors. Where is he? - Dad! -Linda ... -It's just a concert. -Linda ... -Where is he? - Dad! -I want to know. -You ... No, Linda. -Linda ... -Why can't I go to the concert? It's five now. I'll be home before eleven. There will be no concert with that guy. You have school tomorrow. I can bugger off before lunch! What difference does it make if Johan comes? -Don't swear in this house. -Damn ... Linda ... She'll turn 18 in a year. Maybe we should ... I promised to give her money as long as she studies. I'll stick to that, but not if she's spending time with him. -She'll sleep at Jacob's tonight. -She can learn a lot from her brother. She has a private room at Jacob's now. Do you know how long ago it's been since she slept at home? Three weeks. Get out of here. "My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me." "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish"- - "And no one shall snatch them out of my hand." What does this mean? How are we protected by our Saviour Jesus? I forgot the cigarettes. Every time I hear the door, I think it's your father coming home. Is there anything to eat? I'm hungry. You were supposed to cook today, Mom. -What's your excuse now? Money? -You never eat at home anyway. Pick up these before people start to wonder. You can't chuck everything away. It isn't lost yet. If only this year would go by so I can get out of here. Escape from me? Come along. What if ... What if Dad hadn't spent all our money. Then perhaps we'd live at the big house and you and your parents in this house. Then maybe if my dad had lived, Mom wouldn't feel so sorry for herself. -He didn't kill himself. -What the hell do you know about it! -Your brother lives on our farm. Holy shit! -It isn't Jacob's fault. He inherited the farm from grandfather. Jacob always defended your father. You? Hello? Mellberg has broken his leg; so I have to lead the investigation. -How are you? -My cousin Conny and his family are here. -Are they watching TV? -I'll explain later. Hurry home. -Hey! -Hey! You have a visitor. Damn! You scared the life out of me! Did you receive a report of a missing tourist last week? -Yes. Why? -God damn it, Ernst! It was the dead girl we found this morning! The kind of thing to notice and to fill out a report. Damn smart ass ... -Are they still there? -Conny and family? I'll go check. Hey, darling! -Take a shower, I can handle this. -Is it safe? You're the best. -I want ice cream. -We haven't any. -Go buy some. -We have some nice cakes. -I want ice cream. -We haven't any. I want ice cream, ice cream, ice cream. Fucking bastard. - Dad! Dopey is mean. I want ice cream. Hey! So you're the one who knocked up Erica. Victor is at a phase where he's constantly testing his limits. He has to discover for himself, the boundry between his will and his environment. You ... Could you get some ice cream? Then I thought ... It's getting late. Can we stay overnight? -Sure. -Excellent. Finally. Dad said you were coming. A girl was found murdered. The police are knocking on doors. -Has he asked you to supervise me? -He's just worried about you. Marita has food ready. Let's eat. Can't you talk to dad so I can go to the concert? Please ... They're finally asleep. -She's most like me, I think. -She? You are jealous. We may make a boy, and so he may be like you. Oh yes ... Toilet paper has run out. All right. I'll fix it. I'm coming. Soon, we'll catch up to Stockholm. -What have you found? -We aren't finished yet ... ... But we have found sperm. We're checking our records. -What did she die of? -All three were strangled. The killer isn't a likable person. What was done to her before she died is remarkable. All of Tanja's legs, fingers and toes were broken. The others have similar injuries. The other victims were Siv Lantin and Mona T?rnblad who disappeared in '79. Siv was last seen leaving a party at two in the morning. 14 days later Mona disappeared around noon after going jogging. -Do we know who did this to Tanya? -No. What a sick bastard. A serial killer who waits 20 years! There were no leads until until we got Gabriel Hult's tip. He saw Siv in his brother's car. Johannes Hult stole his brother's fianc?e. They married later. A few months after Johannes hanged himself. Hult? Are they related to our two petty criminals, Robert and Johan? Johannes is their father. Robert found him hanging when he was six. -What do we do? -Check out more about Tania. Talk to Siv and Mona's parents and perhaps also to Gabriel Hult. Solveig ...? -Go, or else ... -Your threats don't bother me anymore. Look at me! You testified against your own brother. You swore you saw the girl in his car, but now it's happened again. They found her along with the others. You lied and drove your brother to his death! -You spread shame on your family! -I saw what I saw. You may have killed them yourself. God knows you are a pervert. I remember how you came running; with your cock in one hand ... -... And the Bible in the other. -Do you want money? I want to see you burn in Hell, Gabriel Hult. Go away. We phoned. Park anywhere. Lars, hey! - Hemorrhoids. Boring I know, but there's nothing to report. Do you recall Gun Lantin's maiden name? Was Siv your daughter? What happens now? When will we get Siv's remains? We must have a proper burial. We could offer food and coffee, or a three-course meal. I ran into Hans Lagerberg's wife. We said we have to get together ... Please, we have to consentrate of this. Can you tell me about her? We're trying to identify her acquaintences. -Did she know Mona T?rnblad? -I don't know. She was only 17 when she became pregnant by that German boy. Then she had to stop studying. I couldn't take care of the girl. -Where is her daughter now? -Dead. In a car accident when she was five. I had difficulties at the time. When Siv disappeared, I was alone here. I sent the girl to her father in Germany. I know it's horrible. I wasn't even informed about the funeral. -Do you have a photo of Siv? -I don't know ... I didn't take many photos then. I'll see what I can find. She does have many good points. Thank you! Can I borrow this? Hello, sweetheart! We didn't find any food, so we ate at Josefina's. -You should have come. -Yes. Will you continue to Koster today? We looked out over the ocean and thought we have to go out to the islands. -Don't you have a boat? -Yes, but Patrik's unwilling to lend it out. -That's understandable. -Yes, I'd never lend out mine. But you could take us. Then we'll call you when we want to come back. Isn't that a good idea? Actually, we're ready to go now. Johan? Johan? Why don't you answer? Our mother's cooked dinner. Everyone will understand he was innocent now. Haven't you heard? They've found a murdered girl along with the two who disappeared. -No one can say it was Dad. -Are you fooling with me? No, it's true. -What was he like? -I can hardly remember anymore. I only remember what he looked like when I found him. Every time I close my eyes I see him in front of me. -Why did he hang himself? -Because he didn't love us anymore? You sound like a fucking bitch. It is clear he loved us. I don't understand this. They can't just move in. -consider the parents. -It's my fault for asking them to stay. -I'll talk to them. -No, I'll do it. Well? -What did they say? -They want spaghetti and meat sauce. Chop the onion. I can't cook for a whole tribe again. Time to go to bed, children. -Good night. -Good night. Sleep well. Dad must feel horrible. Accusing his brother, who now turns out to be innocent. -Don't talk about things you don't know. -Nobody says anything to me. Our father saw one of the girls in Johannes'car the night she disappeared. Why was he out in the middle of the night? I was in the hospital then. He and Grandfather took turns sitting with me. Johannes may have just run into her. He said he was at home sleeping. -Was Grandfather angry? -Yes. He thought about letting Johannes inherit everything, but Johannes died first. If he had lived, I'd live in the cottage. -Everyone says that. -Really? What then? Why was Grandfather so angry about Johannes? Grandma died when Johannes was born. Then Gabriel and Johannes travelled around with grandfather. Grandfather realized early on they both could do faith healing. Every church service ended with grandfather and Johannes healing the sick. -Can he still do it? -I doubt it. You usually lose the ability when you enter puberty. At least, that's what grandfather said. Grandfather gave money to both of them when they turned eighteen. Johannes squandered his, where upon grandfather struck him out of the will. It's a circus. But you should show more respect to our father. -He wants only the best for you. -You wouldn't think so. You've reached Gabriel Hult's voice mail. Leave a message. I was alone. Gabriel travels a lot. It sounds silly, but I'm afraid of the dark. -Do you know who it was? -Our house is a mote in the people's eyes. It's plain jealousy. Probably just a whim or a prank. But my wife insisted on calling the police. Ask my husband's nephews what they were doing last night. -They were there. -We agreed not to ... -Did you see them? -No, but I know it was them. Their mother was here earlier in the day and caused a scene. And the boys are real bad apples. -Whose golf clubs? -My husband's. What's your handicap? -What did Solveig want? -It's a long story. -You reported your brother. -Yes. He was my brother, I saw the girl. I had been to the hospital to see my son who had leukemia. As I drove home I passed my brother's car. The girl was leaning against his shoulder and seemed to be asleep. -How did you know she was Siv? -I recognized her in the newspaper. I just said what I saw. I've never accused my brother of her murder. -But what do you think? -I'll stick to facts. Was he capable of murder, do you think? Does it matter anymore after what's just happened? -What do you think? -I don't know which is worse. somebody kills three girls under 30, or Johannes Hult - -murdered Siv and Mona in '79 and someone's copying him now. You should check with the prison. If somebody did time between girls' disappearances and this murder. That could explain the break. It's a good idea. Johan! The cops are here. -Are you here, about what I saw in the paper. -That's not why we're here. We want to talk to you and your brother. Hello, Solveig! -What's this about? -What were you doing last night? Were you at the big house amusing yourselves throwing stones? -We were at home all evening yesterday. -They were both here. We watched television. Amusing themselves breaking windows at the big house? When they feel like it? They were at home both of them, as I said. We had a nice family evening. You said the same when Gabriel saw Johannes and the girl. You were at home having a nice family evening, then as well. -Why were you up at the big house. -Can't I visit my relatives? Or does he think I broke their windows? It was no courtesy call. You were some pretty hard on them. I imagine the police don't have anything else to do except bother honest people. See you. I heard. Why didn't you call me, Mom? -Hard to teach an old dog new tricks. -Stop it. You're still young, Mom. Now the police have talked to them, so they'll hold off for a while. We have to go through the records. I just want to go up to grandfather's room first. It's a long time since I was there. Look at that! Punctual as usual. -I have to hurry. -Now then, you know the rules. First, a snack, and then the payment. It would be rude of me not to offer something- -When I get like a nice visitor. There you go. Aren't we having a good time? sitting here chatting like two old friends. Right? You know what bothers me? you set the police on us. The police said you accused my boys- -I don't know what to believe. I think you owe me an apology. Don't you owe me one? The boys were here all night. Well? I'm waiting. -I apologize. -Excuse me? I didn't hear what you said. I apologize. I was wrong. Now the incident is over and done with, shouldn't we get the other done with as well? That's right. As usual. It's always nice to see you. We'll do it again next month. -It was a long time since you were here, huh? -Yes, we moved out when I was five years old. Come! My place is here. There isn't anything to steal. -What? -I was kidding. We lived here first. If it hadn't been for your dad, we'd still be here. It's not Dad's fault Johannes was broke and then killed himself. -Gabriel was jealous, says mom. -She tried to extort money from Dad. When it wasn't possible, she went to your dad. You know what you call that? A whore. Do you hear that? A whore. Get lost, you damn loser! Bloody hell ... Damn! I hate sausage. I'm hungry. I want something else. -Eat the macaroni then. -I hate macaroni. -Mom ... -Can you give Lisa something else? There is nothing else. - Eat it or don't. You are unreasonable. If Lisa wants something else she should get it. She has the right to express herself just like us. If you had food you didn't like; would you just accept it then? It was the same soil on the body, the blanket, and the skeletons. -like they were in the same place. They found traces of fertilizer, a rather unusual brand. Check out who bought it. -Did they say anything about DNA? -No. There is a queue. Lots of rapes. One has fallen, and one is knocked up. Wouldn't I do my job? It's lucky they have us otherwise nothing would have been done. -Did you check out the garage burglary? -When would I have got to it? I knocked at the door late Friday. Now I'm the family's black sheep. Not at all, you're a genius. Now maybe we can be left in peace. I must stop. Take your iron pill. Kiss! Kiss! The M?ller family, their daughter has disappeared. Hello. Patrik Hedstr?m. Bo Moller. This is my wife Kerstin. -Our daughter never came home yesterday. -We are staying at the campsite in Grebbestad. Jenny wanted to go to Fj?llbacka with some friends. -How old is she? -Soon eighteen. They were coming home by car or bus. When they arrived, we asked the others. She hadn't come by bus. The others thought she'd follow later. -What time was that? -Last night at two o'clock. Then we realized something was wrong. She'd never do this to us. We read about the girl found in King's Gap ... We won't prejudge events. Do you have a photo of Jenny? Cute girl. -Do you have to wait 24 hours first? -Only in American movies. It usually gets resolved before that. This kind of thing happens a lot. They meet someone, forget the time and then we hear from ... What are the names her friends? This concerns Jenny. We'd like to speak to Melanie. -May we come in? -Yes. -Did you plan to meet on the bus? -Yes. We wanted to meet some guys. -But Jenny never showed up. -No. Great. I got to have both guys on my own. She was miserable. It's not my fault she is missing. -Did she spent time with anyone else here? -She usually hung out with some nerd here. -Where can we find him? -His parents' caravan is over there. By the birches. Next to the white tent. Are you Per? Hey! It was my fault something happened. -What do you mean? -She missed the bus. We met every summer and had a blast, but then she met Melanie. In the past we could talk about anything. Now, only Melanie this or make-up that. -What do you mean "your fault"? -I broke up with her. She only spoke when Melanie wasn't looking. It was as if she was ashamed of me. When she wanted to go I told her how I felt. She was sad but didn't care. Then she said she had missed the bus and would have to hitchhike. That's why it's my fault. I got her to miss the bus. Don't worry. We'll find her. Patrik! The German police found Tanja's father. Call, Martin. -Not a soul here ... -Aren't you resting? You have one minute to brush your teeth and change clothes. We haven't anything. The clues don't reveal anything. -The press? -So far ... It won't do. The entire municipality is scared. The tourist season starts soon. Camping and hotels have to be filled. People can't just disappear! Find her! -We're doing what we can! -It won't do! I am responsible for the investigation. Two things mustn't set foot here: They are Germans, nudists and CID. Do you understand? You should probably take over. How the hell can I do that? I have a cast on this leg! Martin, have you phoned the father? Do it now! -G?sta! Anything new about the girl? -No. -Someone at the campsite must have seen something. -Put them to work. I'm going to eat at the hotel. I deserve that. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I said a lot of stupid things earlier ... -I was just so pissed off. -It's okay. I don't know why I did that either. It was hard to be there again. I understand that now. It wasn't so much about you. You should be nice to me. Otherwise, I'll tell about the girl we saw. You promised. Dad will kill me otherwise. A Hult's promise isn't worth a lot. You didn't explain why Gabriel snitched. Can you explain why? Why not? Now be nice to me ... darling. I just talked to Tanja's father. We have made a breakthrough. -Tanya is Siv Lantin's daughter. -Impossible. She's dead. Patrik! We received an anonymous tip about a root cellar. Call for backup. We'll go. Police! Don't move! It is real electronics shop in there. There are two skeletons here! Two women disappeared in the 70s. Siv Lantin, 19 years old. Mona T?rnblad, 18 years old, disappeared two weeks later. All three were strangled. What was done to them was remarkable. You testified against your brother. You said you saw the girl in his car. It's started again. They've found another one. Dad called. A girl's been found, murdered. Ask what my husband's nephews were doing last night. The M?ller's came to report their daughter is missing. -You are proud of her, huh? -Is it serious? People can't just disappear! The girl must be found. -We're doing everything we can! -That won't do! Police! It is pure electronics store there. Preacher based on a novel by Camilla L?ckberg It's the third day now. I don't know what to do. Follow your instincts. If there's anyone who can find her, it's you. We're appealing to the public for help. If you've seen her, please contact us. Questions? Yes? -Do you have any suspects? -No comment. -Is the person in custody involved? -No comment. -Is there any connection? -It can't be excluded. Is there a link between the German girl and the disappearances in the 70's? Yes, we can't comment further. You'll have to make do with that. Any other questions? Are the tourists correct to worry about their safety? -We're doing everything we can. -Yes or no? Are you deaf? You heard what he said? -Next. -Have you slipped on a banana peel? We're doing everything we can to solve this. One last question. Do you assume Jenny is still alive? -What did you say? -Slip on a banana peel? Is that interest in the investigation or for your paper? Pucko ... You can go now. The interrogation and search didn't yield anything. We have no evidence. Damn! It's stolen goods worth 100,000 SEK. It isn't our priority. We need to find Jenny. I think it's linked to the Hult?s. Their dad was a suspect and his brother saw him. -Robert and Johan were just kids then. -What do we do now? We start from the beginning. Tanya Schmidt. The fertilizer manufacturer's going through his old customer list. So my granddaughter's been alive all these years? Her father said she was dead when you asked him for maintenance. -Damned lie! -Honey, calm down. First, he says my grandchild died. -Then he says it's my fault. -We're sorry. -Was she looking for us? -She wanted to know more about her mother. Then it can't be a coincidence, she went to King's Gap. -We are investigating what she knew. -We know only what she wrote in her letters. Who's doing this to me? First, Siv and then Tanya. -Maybe it's someone who wants to hurt me. -So, so ... We should go through all the testimony again. If the girls hitchhiked somebody must have seen them. Only, we can exclude Johannes Hult. He hanged himself in '79. -How do you know? -No, now you can check yourself. But what if the police came too close and he chose to disappear. He had money and influence. His son found him. Children don't lie about things. There is only one way to find out. -Hey! It's me. Aren't you sleeping? -No, the book has to be finished. Go to sleep, or it will be difficult. The publishers are rushing me because they think Alex's story will sell well. -If not, then? Anything new under the sun? -No ... I've never felt this good. Patrick is ... ... Wonderful. How are you? The children are with friends and I'm sailing. -When will I meet him? -We are in Grebbestad now. -If your want, I will gladly drop in. -It's settled, you're coming. -How is he? Is he handsome? -Really nice. I have found Mr. Right now. -I'll make the bed up for you up there. -How cozy! See you. Hugs, hi! It was Erica. We'll get upstairs to ourselves. If we stay on the boat I get you to myself. How do you now? How do you think? Annika asked us to check out a farmer who uses fertilizer. Oh no, it's Hedstr?m's orders. Now we'll take it easy, have coffee and admire the view. Not bad, huh? But if he has the girl will we find her first. Imagine Hedstr?m if we solve the case. They're fucking lucky to have us, G?sta. Hurry up now! Is this really a good idea? -Where is Robert? -Yesterday, you took him ... ... And now you ask where he is! -Hunt down the killer instead! -Mom, it's cool. -What do you want? -We need help. -Aren't we finished with each other? -Theft Division probably doesn't think so. -What do you want? -Tell me about your father's death. -Now get the hell out, enough! -Take her away, Johan. -I don't want to talk about it. -Of course, you found him? -I can put in a good word for you. -That it was just gifts. Call G?teborg and see what they say about "gifts". What do you want to know? The door was open so I checked if my dad was there. -What was he doing? -Giving the cows hay. Something wasn't right. It was so quiet. I saw him lying there. I thought he was joking and wanted to frighten me. Dad could be like that. But he didn't move. Then I saw the rope around his neck. -What did you do? -Called mom. -Was anyone else here? -Not a soul. -Did you call the police? -No. Ephraim came and took care of everything. -Did the police ever come here? -No. Maybe he talked to them. But it was suicide. Are you sure he was dead? -Yes. Johan? Will you come, right now? He's taking a nap. Come in. I'll get him. -What's the matter now? -It's about a fertilizer. FZ-302. You disturb my beauty sleep and ask what fertilizer I use. -The police don't have much to do. -We have our reasons. Now, answer. Don't torment yourselves unnecessarily. I have nothing to hide. FZ-302 ... I used it up to '84, '85. Then some tree huggers tried get me to understand- - it had a negative impact on the biological balance. -How long did you use fertilizer? -Ten years. From the mid 70's. Why do you want to know? It hasn't anything to do with the girls they found? You don't suppose I have anything to do with it! Calm down now! We want to look around here, so that we can remove you from the investigation. G?sta, go out and check out back. I'll come soon. It is a hefty fellow. He isn't involved. It won't take long to look around. -Are you out of your mind?! -Ephraim took care of it all. -Where would he live, then? -Abroad , they had plenty of money. This is your first case ... Somewhere out there is a girl whose legs may be broken, while we ... -Look for her, then! -We have to turn over every stone! -We don't dig up graves for it. -It's the Prosecutor's decision. If you put yourself up against me, it's the last thing you'll do here. -You were at once a boat race. -Yes, the regatta at Mallorca. That's right, the Copa del Rei, huh? -Yes, exactly. I saw a lot of masts in front of me ... -Isn't he cute? -Yes. -We haven't had time to talk much. -He knows the king. How the hell can you name a boat that? So fucking stupid. Where did she find him? Did she clone Lucas, right? Don't burn everything. Patrick is coming soon. What is it? I know you. You don't like him, right? Hold off. We have just met. But he could pay more attention to you than Mary. Hey, baby! How are you? You don't need to be here, if you don't want. I'll just wash myself a bit first. At the Nobel Banquet of course, you mix with every Tom, Dick and Harry. That life seems so exciting. -Do you want to share this with me? -Have you found her, Patrick? -Don't talk about it now. -No, not yet. -You are the police, yes. -Yes, in Tanum. -Sad case ,you have. -Yes. - Is there more sauce? Tourists won't come here now. I talked to some colleagues earlier. -They'll go to the Stockholm archipelago instead. -Then there's no harm done. Though it is just bad for those who live here. Tom, Dick and Harry, do you mean? A young girl is being held out there. We don't even know if she is alive. I'm sorry. I'm tired. I'll go to bed. You know how important this dinner was for me. Everything can't always be about you. -Don't be so childish. -I'm not. I'm sorry. -Poor Anna. I'll say I'm sorry. -No, no. Never mind. -If only I could help you ... -You do. I can't do this without you, you know it. No, I don't know. Tell me. Today I did as you said - followed my instincts. I hope you know what you're doing, Hedstr?m. The doctor who signed the death certificate is still alive. The Undertaker as well. So now we keep our fingers crossed, Hedstr?m. -Do we open the coffin here or in G?teborg? -Here. If the coffin settles it. Otherwise, we'll take the body for identification. I have Hult's dental records. Where did she come from? - G?sta. -Solveig, easy ... -To hell with him! Now get out now. Will this never end? -What do you say? -Hard to say, but it feels heavy. Fine, Hedstr?m. When you're ready. Yes, then ... we'll do it. You could have been right, Patrick. -Are we going to find her? -If it isn't already too late. -Yes? -Johan Hult wants to talk to you. They dug up his grave. Surely you must know how they feel? Can't you do something? -We don't know what they're after. -It isn't our concern. -Good God ... -It could have been us. No, but I know they want to trick you into it. You, your brother and us are a different sort. You have to accept your lot in life. What if you don't want to, then? Leave her alone. She is free to be good again. -What do you want? -To talk with Linda. -We're eating. -We want to talk to Linda. Your cousin Johan Hult told us about one evening last week when you were seen together. It's possible. -Did you see anything special. -Answer him! -Yes, we saw the German girl who was murdered. -Tanja Schmidt? -Yes. -Where were you when you saw her? -In Johan's car at V?sterg?rden. -What were you doing? -Nothing! Jacob has followed in Ephraim's footsteps. He runs a foundation to help problem-adolescents. Can you tell us more? What was she wearing? -I don't know. It was quite dark. -Think about it. Jeans, jacket and some red bag. -Was she going to V?sterg?rden? What are you looking for? Wasn't it enough to open the grave? -We regret ... -Was the coffin empty, right? -No. -What do you regret then? -Do you think Jacob is involved? -We just want to clarify it. Clarify? You wrap it nicely. You're just trying to finish what your colleagues began in '79. You just want to convict a Hult. First, you wanted to prove Johannes is still alive and began murdering again. When that proves impossible, you throw aspersions on my son Jacob. Get out now! You can't come back without a warrant. Until then you can go to hell! Linda! Linda! -Linda ... -Let go! damn idiot! Hello. This is Pedersen. It was Johannes Hult lying in the coffin. We are fully confident, but he didn't die by hanging. -The back of his skull was crushed. -Was he clubbed? I don't know. He is here in front of me. I'll call you later. The exhumation wasn't a waste of time and money. I'm going to join a nunnery. But .. little old woman ... I am so sick of you and your fucking albums! -What are you doing? -Wake up, dammit. -You weren't supposed to say anything! -They refuse to leave us in peace. I can't go home now. Dad is crazy. What are we supposed to do about it? Stay in the loft tonight. I will come there when Rob and mom have gone to sleep. -Okay? It will be okay. -Damn idiot. -Now we have another homicide to tackle. -He could have been a professional soccer player. All the victims were on their way to or from Fj?llbacka. -Someone must have seen something. -We'll have to start knocking on doors again. -A prank call? -No assailant was in prison for 20 years. -Fertilizer? -The farmer isn't involved. We'll have to expand the search area. V?sterg?rden and the German girl ... Could it be something religious? If it was her they saw. We'll take a look at Jacob Hult's. That's all. Go out and knock on doors! Hedstr?m. You did good. Not great, but good. -Dear God, bless the food. Amen. -Amen. Can I help you with anything? If want to you look at ... -We're just going to eat. Do you want to join us? -No thanks. We would like to talk to you. Ideally, before you eat. Don't wait for me, go ahead and start. Close the door, Kennedy. I'll be all right. -Is this about the murdered girl? -Yes, Tanja Schmidt. Your sister and Johan Hult saw her up here. -Why would she come here? -Had she heard of V?sterg?rden. Tanja Schmidt wasn't a tourist. She wanted to know more about her mother. She was the daughter of Siv Lantin who disappeared '79. Well ... that's news. What has it got to do with V?sterg?rden? She wanted to get more information. Johannes lived there then. He was a suspect in the case. It is our good fortune or our faith that bothers you? -My uncle was innocent. -We are doing our job. I've never seen the girl, but you are welcome to look around. -That's probably all for now. -You're welcome to come back. I know what you're doing. Leave Jacob alone. You will be punished. God sees everything. He's probably fine with it. Now, move out of the way. Let's go and eat. We'll begin with the cause of death. The back of the skull is crushed and the jaw broken. Probably by a blow to the front. -Then it's murder. -Probably. We have a zealous intern here. She compared the DNA of Johannes with the semen found on Tanja. The semen belongs the family of Johannes Hult. -How? -I don't know yet. Johannes' DNA matches the semen on Tanja- -It shows the murderer is related to Hult. We have four possibilities: Johan, Robert, Gabriel and Jacob. We need to take blood samples from all the Hult males. -I think it's Robert. -Don't speculate. I've caught him in the act, and still he denies it. Speaking of stealing: The farmer we visited- -Told me someone's been stealing bags of fertilizer. People are so efficient they steal shit. -What did you say? -I said somebody's stealing fertilizer. V?sterg?rden is his nearest neighbour. This is important information. -I must have been outside then. -I can hardly remember everything? Well, that's exactly what you have to do! We'll talk about it later. Tanja was seen at V?sterg?rden, the bags are from the neighbouring farm- And so Jacob's DNA should be checked. G?sta and I'll get him. - Obtain reinforcements for a search warrant. -Blood tests? -Bring someone from the medical center. Label and send them to Pedersen post haste. I, then? You stay here. That's all for today. Kennedy and Lelle will take care of you. -What fine! Now we'll go home. -Not yet. There isn't anything that can't wait. You're tired. You need to rest. You are wise, you are. I have to go to the office first. Wait here. I haven't anything to add, but we shall go into the office? We want to talk to you at the station. Never mind. Go home with the kids. I'll come back later. The police are putting more wood on the fire to destroy themselves. Don't go home with the kids. We're conducting a search. -What? -We'll discuss this further at the station. It's absurd. Is this legal? They are within their rights, unfortunately. All papers are in order. Remember this under protest. Now you come so we can take a little sample too. -We aren't harassing your family. -Evil requires no motive. -God sees the truth. -Is your father a believer? His relationship with Ephraim was what framed his faith in God. You and your grandfather were close. He saved your life by donating bone marrow. Your father and Johannes are said to have hated each other. My father didn't kill his brother. -Johannes hanged himself. -No. He was probably murdered. How did your father behave, when Johannes died? I don't know ... I was in the hospital. I was ten years old. My family and I are innocent. Tanja's killer is related to Johannes. We've taken samples of your whole family, including you. It is just as well that you cooperate. Take all the samples you want, but when they are wrong- -Will you apologize to me and my family. -Hedstr?m. -Pedersen. I can get hell for this. Come on. A 17-year-old girl's life is at stake. According to the first test Jacob's semen doesn't match the sample from the victim. -Okay ... Damn it. -But there is one more thing. The second sample was Gabriel. According to our analysis- -It's impossible for him to be the father of Jacob. I'm thirsty. I have decided. We'll run away, to G?teborg. -Are you sure? -Yes. -Go and pack. See you at the crossroads. -About half an hour. Linda? -Does my husband have to know about it? -The police don't need to tell him. Johannes. Johannes is Jacob's father. Gabriel and I had been trying to conceive. Then it happened there with Johannes. The child was either Gabriel's or Johannes'. -How did you know the baby was Johannes'? -As soon as I saw the baby. -Did Johannes about that? -Yes. He loved Jacob. Johannes told Solveig. As soon as he was gone she began... -Black mail? -Every month for 28 years I've paid. Now it's over. Now it's over. Now I don't have to anymore. -Where is your brother? -I don't know. Johan? Johan, dinner! - He'll come soon. Johan? Come on, you fucking dope. What the hell ...? Johan? Mom! Patrik? Jacob is gone. He never came home yesterday. He didn't sleep at Gabriel's either. -After what happened to Johan ... -What? He has been beaten up. He is in hospital and may die. Jacob was upset by our conversation. Maybe he wants to be alone. He would never do what's happened. -Hey! -What is she doing here? -What about him? -They still operating on him. Martin? We received a call regarding the beating of Johan. Send G?sta and Ernst. There must be something. He's dead. How so? Yes, yes ... No, it isn't at all far-fetched. Thank you! I know where Jenny M?ller is. -Hell! -Are you Lelle? Me and Kennedy hit the guy who is related to Jacob. Kennedy was freaking out. He said he'd only talk to him. -Talk about what? -Something Johan said about Jacob. -What did you do then? Pick flowers? -I held him. Will I go to jail now? Now we need to get hold of Kennedy. -Can I help you with anything? -You must accompany us to the station. Well. Shall we go, then? -Have you found anything? -Nothing. Have you checked that? I'll check the kitchen. -Have you checked the desk? -Yes, it is solid. That's not true ... Martin? Martin! Johannes described exactly how he hurt the girls- -To late to heal them. And here, Jacob has taken over. What the hell ...? He has got back the cancer. The same day he was told that, Tanya came and asked about her mother. He saw it probably as a sign from God. He must be near by. -Linda. Are Solveig or Robert there? -Yes, inside with Johan. He's woken up. -Get Robert. Hi, Robert. We need your help. I'm on V?sterg?rden. Is there any hiding place here on the farm? The old air-raid shelter in the forest. We played there as children. We showed it to Jacob. He snitched and father forbade us to go there. -Where exactly is it? -Follow the path between the fences. Jacob? We know you are there! Come out! You didn't make the girls sick. You did just as Johannes did. Come out. Jenny, are you there? -Let her go. -You will protect me. Why am I not in your favour today? -I need more time. -Put it down girl. Why did God send me a miracle yesterday, and abandon me today? God didn't save you, Ephraim did. You passed the blood test thanks to his donor marrow. You got his blood and DNA. But isn't it a miracle? Take him away. Damn ... - She is still alive. Give an ambulance! -Did Jacob know about it? -Yes. Is Linda ...? She's your baby. And you've still lost her. I'll pack. I'll go tomorrow. I still don't understand that about the blood. Jacob has two persons DNA. Ephraim donated bone marrow to him. Jacob's blood has the same DNA as the donor. The blood test had Ephraim's DNA, the semen on the victim had his own. Yes, that surely must be it. We have done a damn good job. The police chief called and thanked. I couldn't agree more. Your comments should be addressed. But who killed Johannes Hult? -Patrik, telephone. -We have meeting! Now. -Why don't you answer your phone? - The battery is dead. Why? It has started now. The water's burst. We must go now. It's not until about three weeks. -Tell that to the baby. It will now! Jacob Hult. He tortured two girls to then try to heal them. He was convicted of murder but is mentally ill. He has a severe brain tumour. -How long has he left? -Six months. He claims he will be healed. We let him be. What's he doing now, then? He behaves strangely at times. At least, the poor pigeon was already dead.
