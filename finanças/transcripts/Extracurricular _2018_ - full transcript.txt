[grand music] [light music] [Ray] They do. Look at the bark and the leaves. And, uh... [Gina] I think it's over there. Okay. [clears throat] [Gina] And I think one of them is a conifer. Like say... - [Ray] Conifer? - [Gina] No, Conifer. - [Ray] What is that? - Conifers! - [Ray] What is that? - It's like a type of tree! - Coniferous tree. - I don't know. This whole tree talk is freaking me out. Coniferous. Cauliflowers. Okay, what's this fascination with trees, by the way? I'm happy to be here. That's all. All right. [sighs] [door clicking] [Ray] All right, good. Well let's see, oh, wow. - Oh, yay. - [Ray] Oh, this is nice. - [Gina] Yes, it is. - Nicer than I expected. - [Gina] You know what it reminds me of? - What's that? - It's like Steve's cabin a little. - [Ray] Steve's cabin? - [Gina] Yes! - What are you kidding me? Steve's cabin is haunted. [Gina laughs] It kind of is. You're right. It is. I told him, too. Oh, this is cool. Hey, I think babe, there are actual beds up there. - [Ray] And plumbing. - Yes, there's plumbing, you big baby. Okay, why don't you put our clothes away, then I'll start a fire. [Ray] Yeah. Of course. [Ray] You know that's not a real fireplace, right? Yeah, but this is nice. I just want one romantic weekend with you before I bloat up. In a few weeks you won't even want to touch me. No. That's not true. Okay. I like this. [light music] It's not so bad? Not so bad, he says! [he laughs] [eerie ambient music] - [car horn honking] - [car alarm blaring] [eerie ambient music] Babe? - [Ray] Mmph. - [Gina] Why are the car lights on? What? I don't know. - Did you hit the clicker or something? - No. It's over there. What if someone's out there messing with the car? [Ray] Baby, there's no one around here for miles. You should go check or the battery will be dead by morning. Come on. [Ray groaning] Come on. Okay. [sighing] [ominous music] [car alarm chirping] Whoo. Shit. [thudding] [Gina] Ray? [inhales] [exhales] Shit. Ray? Ray, it's not funny! Ray! Ray, where are you? - [screams] - [intense music] [crying in fear] [labored breathing] Please! I'm begging you! Please, don't kill me! Don't touch me!

You can't go to practice, we have to make our list of possible sponsors. I don't know what you want me to say. I've got a game Saturday. I can't miss practice. Yeah. I'm out. AV Club has a budget meeting. I give up! We'll just figure it out without you. Fine. Now... [eerie ambient music] ...about the cabin. Yeah, I hate working outside. - [Jenny] Yeah. Me too. - What? She didn't see us coming at all. It was perfect! Yeah, because her little lamp sucked. If she'd had that Maglite with her from the beginning, - we'd have been screwed. - [Derek] But she didn't. You know, really, I should have been in the car. I thought we agreed that she wasn't going to get into the car. Well, no, but she goes for the door handle, and bam! My mask lit up in the driver's seat! She falls back and you're all there to grab her! Yeah but I mean that's the point. She runs away, she thinks she's home free and then, her legs get swept up from under her. You get to see the light leave her eyes. Right? Mmm. Remember back in June? The beach? We all showed up at once. We scared the fuck out of them. Yeah. That was, was pretty good. Pretty good? Did you see the look on that lady's face, man? She was like, ahh! [imitating scream] Sorry!

Oh, uh, our logo for our Habitats and Humanity affiliate. Kupperman wants it on his desk by Friday. And so a piece of wood is the... Hammer and nail seemed too obvious. Okay. Did you get a chance to look at the posters for the blood drive or do I have to... Uh, If you just show it to Harrison, you can start putting it up. - All right, sounds good. - Cool. - [Derek hums] -How would you have used a piece of wood? [Derek] I don't know, Jenny. Fucking sharpen it. Oh, fuck me! Jesus Christ! - Oh, hey. - [Ian] Hey. [Jenny] Would wood have worked? [Miriam] Is that supposed to be a tongue twister? - [Ian] No, instead of the axe. - [Miriam] Oh. [Layla] Hey. - Hey! - Where were you last night? I texted you like six times. And two of those were cat videos. Yeah. I saw. I, um, was writing a paper... I know. No distractions while you're working. - You get me. [giggles] - That I do. Oh, I got the tripod for tomorrow. We still good? - Oh, could we actually do it later this week? - What's the tripod for? - Uh, she's helping me film my dance application. - Oh. - She's a really good dancer. - Yeah, she is. - Um, I guess I'll see you later then? - Yeah. - For sure. - Okay, bye. Bye. - Hey. - [Derek] Hey. You know I could have let you borrow my tripod, right? [Jenny] So, you're just going to sit there whittling while she's running away. [Ian] All I'm saying is we should have thought it through. You know, brought our own supplies. There's a hundred things we could have used there. It's called on-site procurement. Derek, you play way too many video games. I don't know how you're giving me shit for this. You're whole plan was for them to see the flashing lights from the car and just come running out. [Ian] No, no. I had a fallback plan. Which was? It was, to turn the water off. Maybe either come out to fix it or to take a piss. - Uh, what if they pissed in the sink? - Ew. [Derek] When were you planning on telling us this? He wasn't. He thinks he's some kind of eighth dimensional chess player who's smarter than us. Okay. All right, you've got a plan for everything. I like to just use what's ready and available? Whatever happened to just good old choking somebody? You can strangle someone if it's part of the plan. Derek could strangle half the people in this school. Couldn't you, baby? - Thank you, Sweetie. - I'm sure he could. Okay? But if we don't plan, we can't come to school anymore. If we don't plan, we're going to end up in jail. Or worse. Try that choking idea on you, huh? Awesome, you're stronger than me. Fucking Neanderthal. Okay. If we want to bring an axe, we have to plan for it. If we fail to plan, plan to fail. Okay, so why don't we just make a supply checklist? No! No more checklists! No more prepping. Planning! Got enough homework as it is. This is supposed to be fun, not school. All right? Okay. [dramatic music] Ugh. Jesus. Who called this in? Paper got an anonymous tip. They called us. They said they'll do whatever they can to help us catch the guy. Yeah, well that would be a first, wouldn't it. [exhales] - You've been on the force, what, six years, Mike? - Be six in January. And how many homicides we had in the county before this year? [Mike] Just the Nicholson thing. Yeah, that was a rough one. And how many this year? [Mike] Three. Three? You think they're connected? [Alan] Where's the other body? [Vollman] Captain John Mason approaches the village. Somewhere near the Mystic River. He doesn't have enough men to get through the walls, so he lights the whole thing on fire, gives the order to his men to shoot anyone who tries to escape... Man, what kind of sicko would set someone on fire? Somewhere between four and 700 Pequods are killed, mostly women and children. Now, where I'd like to open this up to you guys, is how Mason, or any of the other English colonies for that matter, how they justify something like this. Mr. Gordon? I mean, what's there to justify? You mess with the best you die like the rest, right? Hmm. Ah, well. Yeah, that's certainly a popular sentiment on this countries T-shirts and bumper stickers but, um, but we are talking about a massacre of innocent people here, Mr. Gordon. What is the moral argument here? Yeah, the other Mister Gordon. Well, the moral argument is an illusion. The idea that there's some absolute law made by the weak to protect themselves. You've been reading Nietzsche, Ian. You should watch out, adolescent testosterone and Nietzsche is a pretty dangerous combination. [all laughing] The people we are talking about here were so devoted to their interpretation of Christianity that they are willing to go across the ocean to live it out. Now how can they possibly justify something like this? Because they're Christian. Yeah. But you can do better than that. That's the whole Calvinist worldview. Some people are saved, and others are damned, and it's already decided. And clearly the Pequods aren't saved, since they're not living like Puritans, so it doesn't matter what you do to them. Yeah. Interesting argument. The point is, that the Calvinist worldview gives a lot of latitude to do horrible, horrible things. What are some of those... [eerie ambient music] [bell ringing] Horrible, horrible things tomorrow. Um, Jamestown papers on my desk. Okay, here we go. "Two Dead in Grand Lake Massacre." Two does not count as a massacre. [stifled laughing] I know, right? "The bodies of Ray Hiestand and Gina Tonali were discovered early this morning by park rangers at a remote cabin." Pre-marital is not the Lord's way. - [laughing] Seriously? - Maybe she didn't change her name. No, here it is. "Friends said the two had been together for three years." Blah blah blah, "...police wouldn't release details of the murders. Ms. Tonali..." [Ian] What? "Ms. Tonali recently told her friends she was expecting their first child." [inhales dramatically] So? Pfft. I mean, it's not like we could have saved her. That was one of our rules right from the beginning, no kids. She wasn't even showing. It was a bunch of cells. Not like we killed a squalling infant. No, I know. You're right. You're totally right. Great. So, Friday? What's Friday? I was thinking some kind of late night activity. You know. Wha... like, another one? Why Friday? It's Halloween. [laughs] Oh, we're serious? [laughs] Doesn't that seem... I thought the whole point was that it's supposed to be, you know, a random act. Halloween seems to be a little clichéd. It's not clichéd, it's classic. It's our first Halloween since we started. We can't just sit at home. That is so not a good idea. We should be lying low. Isn't that one of our rules, though? No patterns? I don't see how that fits. We waited, what, six weeks before the last one? Seven weeks before that. Six weeks before that. That's a pattern. Okay, well, why don't we wait longer? Like, maybe a few months? A few months? Well, ugh, I just got to get my applications in soon. Then we're heading into midterms. Since when do you have to worry about midterms? It just seems like a lot. And, and, and now, killing that kid, I get it, just a bunch of cells but... I don't know, maybe it will make the police look into it a little harder. I say we cool it for a bit. Ugh. So what? You can go to parties, get drunk. Is that it? No, that's not it at all. But maybe we should. Maybe we should go to parties. Act normal. Hey, how about this? We do this one and then nothing until New Year's. Your applications can wait a week, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. [claps] Yes. [Ian] All right. If everything, if everything works out, we move forward. If it doesn't, we scrap it. - Deal? - Deal. [Ian] Deal.

Oh, man. - [Mike] Hey, Al. - Hey, Mike. They ran the story. She was pregnant. - Goddamn. - Fucking animal. Got to call forensic and make sure they keep their mouths shut on this one. I'm getting tired of reading about this shit in the fucking newspapers. - What have you got? - Got the files on Jackson County. Like pulling teeth. Yeah. Some things never change. Okay, looks like we have one the same night it was closed. Got a twofer, looks like a meth deal gone bad by the looks of things. Hang on, four others. - That seem high to you? - Yep. And for them. They don't have the slightest idea where to start. No witnesses. No suspects. No connections. Yeah. Just like us. What you got there? Winchester back in June. Guy had this photo emailed to him right around the time of death. Hang on. Woman last night. Emailed that photograph right before she was killed. [sighing] You thinking what I'm thinking? What you don't get many pictures like that emailed to you from unknown senders? Call the DA, get that warrant we need. It's time we re-open these cases. [suspenseful music] - I'll look into it. - Let me know. Forensics, please. Uh, how's the biology project with you and Miriam coming along? It's not coming along and I'm doing it by myself. Miriam and Layla are pairing up. Wow. Really losing your number one spot to the girls' team, huh? - It's not that. - Really? Okay, I just... she spends so much time with her lately and I feel like it's not in line with what we're doing. You think she's going to snitch? No, no. It, I, I know she wouldn't. I just, I don't want her to slip up. This one's fine. There's a gun rack on the four by four. There. Security system. Those signs are all fake. [Ian] It's too close to the road. [Jenny] What about this one? Hmm. Let's see. Ma is in the garden raking leaves. Pa is chopping wood. Shit. [Jenny] What? Look at him. He looks like fucking psychopath. Okay. You want to move on then? No, fuck that. There's not enough room in this town for all of us. [Jenny] What now? [Ian] Let's go play some pool. All right, let's go get Derek. - [Derek] I don't get why we couldn't finish the game. - [Ian] Well, it's almost two and we have school tomorrow, Derek. [Derek] Ugh, I just think you don't like to lose. Okay. Whatever. [car door alarm beeping] [knocking on window] - Come on. - What's the rush? I have to do that paper for Vollman. Six pages on the Jamestown colony. You haven't done that yet? I have to do footnotes. Slacker. - All right. - I'll see you later. - Yeah. Good night, baby. - Bye. Just, I figure would it kill you to maybe not kiss her in front of me? I don't know? Maybe just... - Okay. - Whatever. [siren whooping] Shit. Get over here. Hi, Dad. [Alan] That was Jenny's car I just saw, right? Well, she, uh, just finished, uh, family dinner thing and uh, she was just coming over to grab some calc notes. Yeah, I get it. Both of you, fully clothed two o'clock in the morning. Guys, look, I know I drive you crazy busting your balls like this, but I love you. Just trying to keep you out of trouble, that's all. Next year you're going to be in college doing God knows what, 'til then how about we follow some rules, huh? [both] Yes, sir. Okay get over here. Give your old man a hug. It's two in the morning, 2:30 for Christ's sake on a school night. Go to bed. - Get out of here. - All right. [dramatic music] Fuck. Oh. Sorry, Mr. Vollman. I didn't realize you were in here. Today is Tuesday, isn't it? Yeah and on a Tuesday you have a, you have a Planning Committee meeting in here. Yeah, but um, we can find somewhere else. It's not a problem. No, no, no, no. Don't worry. I can go eat lunch in my car. Okay. - [Jenny] Hey, Mr. Vollman. - Hi, Jenny. Oh, Ian, I uh, I have something for you. What's this? Think of it as the anti-Nietzsche. Okay, now I know what it's like being a smart teenage kid, okay. If you could have seen me 10 years ago, dressed all in black, trying to liberate myself from the illusion that life has any meaning whatsoever. I guess all I'm trying to say is I think it's important that you establish an opposition, a dialogue and I think this could do just that. Maybe you read it, and it changes the way you look at the world. Or maybe you put it into your backpack and forget all about it. So it goes. Okay? - Hey. - Hi. Hey, Ian. Could I borrow that when you're done with it? Oh, I... I'm done. - [Jenny] Good to go? - Yeah. All right. One story house with a basement. There's a garage about ten feet away and a barn about 20 feet past that. Three buildings? That's a lot to control. Yeah. We'll have to keep them in the house. What if they make a run for it? I think I can outrun a senior citizen. He's 50. Then we'll keep them fenced in. - What next? - They have a front door that they keep unlocked until bedtime, around 11. And side door, not a problem. Cheap lock. Where'd you get those? I went back after I dropped you at home. - Stuck around until about three. - A.M.? - Mm-hmm. - I'm sure dad would leave the country for months on end. Yeah. Having a dad who can't stand to be around me totally rules. Grass is greener. Their names are Dave and Katherine Lauderback. Owe 60 bucks on a credit card, which isn't getting paid and they have a friend in Midland with a new grandkid. That's all I got. We need the floor plans. Who's free after school? I can probably get out of band. Great, then we'll head to City Hall. As long as I'm back before dinner. - Sounds good. - Sounds like a plan. What are you gonna tell your parents when they ask what you've got there? Uh, sociology. A visual history of the suffragette movement. [Jenny] Are you actually doing that in sociology? Yeah, of course. Every good lie has at least 95% truth. Um, do you want to come in for dinner tonight or even just hang out for a few minutes? Nah, your parents are too nice. It kind of freaks me out. Suit yourself. Good night. [light piano music] Hey, monkey. Hey, Dad. What's that? Oh, um, it's white chili with enough cheese to kill a horse. What's in the tube? Just a visual history of the suffragette movement. Oh. Can we see? It's not ready yet. But, ah, I'm just going to drop my stuff upstairs and then I'll be right back down. Yeah. You make us proud, sweetie. [laughs] Was that too much? Just a little. [Kirk] Well, she's a hard worker. [mom] She sure is. [dramatic music] [camera shutter clicking] [camera shutter clicking] [sighs] David L. Lauderback, 55. Married Katherine Sklarski when they were in their late 20s. She doesn't have a record but he got picked up for vagrancy when he was 30. Vagrancy? I don't know. Hitchhiking, maybe? It doesn't say. No weapon permits. One landline, one cell phone, in her name. Got both numbers. Credit score is good, not great. That's it? Yeah, they really liked to live off the grid. No, we can do better than that. He is not on the internet. She has a Facebook account. Seven friends, five of which are relatives. She likes gardening and leaves typical old person comments on her sister's kid's pictures. [laughs] That's pathetic. - So, what are we going to wear? - What do you think? Creepy or what? [Ian] Is this all right? I'd prefer something that covers the whole face. Well, I don't know. What if we make our masks? Like, maybe, potato sacks with eye-holes cut out. [Ian] Hmm. It's been done before. When has it been done before? I don't know. In, like, every slasher movie ever? [Miriam] Yeah, I guess so. Guys, what about these? - [Derek] Holy shit. - [Miriam] Jeez. [Jenny] I used to play lots of dress up as a kid. [Ian] What like animals? Not just animals. Look. Totally creepy, right? Yeah. It's a little disconcerting. - [Jenny roaring] - Okay. [Jenny laughing] [Jenny] I don't know. I've got a bunch of stuff. Zombies, skulls, sexy ladies... Sexy ladies? [Jenny] That's what it says on the label. [Ian] There's no thematic unity. [Derek] So? [Ian] So, who's going to be afraid of four people in mismatched masks? I don't know. Why don't we get a bunch of these and swap them out. They'll think there's like 20 people hunting them. [eerie ambient music] I like it. I don't know. What about coherence? [laughs] Coherence? Fuck coherence. It's about motherfucking chaos. Let's shake some shit up. [exhales] [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] Thanks. - Should I go again, or? - No need. Are you sure? I just, I don't know, I felt like the turns were off and... It was perfect. - Hi. - Hi. Was that okay? Yeah. Um, you just surprised me. In a good way? Yeah, in a good way. [sighing] - [Jenny] Where's everyone else? - Derek's in the washroom. Three guesses where Miriam is. - With Layla? - Got it in one. Hey. Do you mind if I borrow those notes from Ruas' class today? - What the hell is that? - It's nothing, okay? I was, I was going to get rid of it. It's from the cabin, isn't it? You were going to put this in Vollman's desk. I don't know what you're talking about. [scoffs] Ian, please. I'm not stupid. I know you're trying to pin this on Vollman. Okay. Yeah. It's insurance. You know, just in case things don't go to plan. - What have we got? - Take a look. Think we got something. All seven cases but one. Each victim received a different photograph emailed to them from an unknown sender. That's a deliberate pattern, Mikey. Deliberately obscure. I mean who takes a picture of a candy wrapper? I don't know. [exhales] Look, how you getting along with the warrant from the DA? We got to start tracing this thing down. Yeah. I'm working on it. Okay, good. Look, I'm going to head out to the scenes, okay? Maybe we missed something. I think this one thinks he's smarter than us. Let's prove him wrong, yeah? - Let me know. - [Alan] Will do. [dramatic music] - [Alan] What have you got? - [Mike] DA came through. All the pictures were sent from the same IP. - [Alan] You got a trace? - [Mike] The high school. We call out to their tech to see if we can narrow it down. [Alan] Yeah, I'm going to go head out. Take a look around. [Ian] So they made their way to the door. Derek, you're going to be... [Derek] Uh, I will grab the phone and I'll toss it to Jenny. [Jenny] Then Miriam does her bit and, um, - and then they turn around and they see us. - [Ian] All right. I end up blocking the kitchen door here. Derek, you're in the living room. [phone chiming] [clearing throat] Sorry. Um, I get up, they panic and they make it to the hallway. And if they overpower you? - Then I make a run for it this way. - Derek? Ian, we've been over this like a million times, dude. We get it. We know what... If they attack Miriam, where do you go? I don't know. Cry and turn myself in? [laughing] We'll figure it out, all right? We're fine. Come on, it's six. We got to get out of here. Yeah, let's go. We got a lot to do tonight. I'll pick you guys up at nine? - [Derek] Thank you. - [Jenny] You're welcome. Are you okay? You seem distracted. I'm fine. You know that we need you for this. Okay, I know that you got a lot going on, but this is the last one. So... For now. I think me and you both know that's not true. You got better things going on. It's not like that. Oh, it is. It's exactly like that but it's okay. I just need you to be focused. For tonight. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Okay. Okay. [suspenseful music] [Mike] Did you find anything? [Alan] Yeah. I did. All of it. Photographs. All taken here. Even a laptop. And he sent the emails from here. [Mike] I think we're going to get that bastard. Do you need forensics? [Alan] Yeah. Send them over. [phone chiming] [phone chiming] [sighing] [car approaching] [woman on TV] Today, we'll be looking at three different properties, unique design, panoramic view. Doesn't that look like the place - where we were with my sister? - Mmhm. [man on TV] First off we have a suburban haven which at first glance may seem simple... - [knocking on door] - ...with a massive wow factor... Don't worry about it. We don't have candy. The kids will go away. [knocking on door] Jesus. Who's out there? [eerie ambient music] Must be some kids. [grunting] - [banging on door] - [doorbell ringing] [phone ringing] What in the hell? Hello? Hello? [eerie ambient music] Hey! Who the hell is out there? Stop messing around! Get the hell out of here! You're kidding? Ugh. Fine. Yeah. Jesus. - [sighs] - Dave, what? They say it's probably just some kids fooling around. They're going to send someone over but not for a couple hours. [eerie ambient music] I'm going to need something stronger. And then you'll be awake all night tossing and turning. [sighs and sniffs] I'll meet you halfway and I'll get you more sugar. - I'm already sweet enough. - Yes. You are. [knocking on door] [banging on door] Is that the police? [suspenseful music] [Miriam] Help me. Please, help me [Dave] Someone's out here. [Katherine] What is it? [whimpering] [Dave] You okay? [intense music] - [Katherine screams] - [Dave] Run, run! - [grunting] - [Katherine screams] [screams menacingly] - [Jenny screams] - [screams] Let's go, let's go! [Katherine gasping] Oh my god! Who are they? How do I know? Where's your cell? Give me a phone. - It's outside. In the living room on the table. - Jesus Christ. Okay. We got to get out of here. The window. [Katherine] Okay. Lift me up. [intense music] [screaming] There's more of them out there! [door rattling] - [Katherine] What are you looking for? - [Dave] My father's pistol. [Katherine] Ugh. I put it in the barn. It made me nervous! [sighs] [labored breathing] [Katherine] What are you doing? [door rattling] [hushed labored breathing] [phone buzzing] [Dave] I thought you left your phone in the living room? [Katherine whispering] That's not my phone. Oh god. Don't answer! I'm calling the police. Press ignore. No, the other button. Wh... what? How do I do that? Okay, give it to me. [phone ringing] What do you want from us? - [grunting] - [screams] Dave! Dave! [Ian] Nail it in. [Katherine] Dave! What have you done with him? You cowards! [spits] [Ian] Shut up! Dave, Dave! Dave! [door clicking] None of these are good. Jazz, country, blues. None of these seem ominous enough. - Not even as, like, ironic counterpoint. - It's all about juxtaposition. Whatever you put on is going to seem creepy and weird. Hurry up. You're first. [light country music] [Derek] Hey, Bitch! [Jenny] Baby, you know you don't have to wear that anymore. [Derek] But I like it. Makes me feel pretty and elegant. Take it off. Whatever you say, Missus. [Miriam] How'd you guys do in Robinson's class today? Uhhh. I think I missed the one on buoyancy. Hey! [muffled chuckle] Pick up six. Fuck. Five, six. Ian, how hard did you hit that dude? You sure you didn't kill him? Last time I checked he was breathing. - Is it me? - Yeah, it's you. - Hey, uh, Jenny. Pick up two, pick up four. - [Derek] Oof. I could kill you. I actually think we already have that covered, so... Do you guys remember Darby? She was in our grade two class, I think and she always had her hair in pigtails. We were so close. We told each other everything. And then one day she just moved away and we never spoke. And you're telling us this why? No reason. [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] [coughing] [coughing] [grunting] [door clicking] [floor creaking] [gasping] [breathing heavily] Katherine? Kath? [breathing heavily] [phone clicking] [suspenseful music] [grunts] [intense music] [grunting] - [yelling] - [gurgling blood] [gurgling blood] Where the hell did you get that? Basement. Tried your advice, improvisation. Fuck me. Nicely done. [breathing heavily] [heavy breathing] [screams] Third mask? Third mask. [suspenseful music] [heavy breathing] [screams] [heavy breathing] It's stuck. [Ian] Let me try. [Derek] Knock yourself out. You've got a plan for this, right? [Ian] The plan was that she didn't get in the first place, Derek! [Miriam] Shut up for two minutes. There's a door back here. I think I can kick it through and one of us can fit. [Ian] Great. Who's going in? [Miriam] I'm going in. [banging on door] [howling] [howling] [barking like dog] [suspenseful music] [breathing heavily] [Jenny] Guys! Car! [Ian] Hurry it up in there. Someone's coming. - Everyone stay put. - Shit. It's a cop. - Keep her quiet. I'll handle it. - [Katherine moaning] [Derek] Shut her the fuck up! [Ian] Jenny, whatever you're doing, don't do it! [Jenny] I said I'll handle this. [Ian] Jenny! He gets out, I come up behind him, take him out. [Ian] No. No, no cops. You know that, no cops. [Derek] No, if were going down for this, you take him the fuck out... [Ian] She's taking out no one. You shut the fuck up. [eerie ambient music] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] [Alan] Hello? Police officer! Hello? This is Sheriff Gordon. What the hell is he doing here? [stifled screams] [Alan] Anybody there? Hello? [Jenny] He's heading to the barn. [stifled screams] What are you doing? [breathing heavily] [phone ringing] [dispatcher] 911. What is your emergency? There's somebody in my house. I'm at 6378 Route 124. I think he has a gun. [Jenny] Sorry, guys. It's him or us. [Ian] No. Stand the fuck down, Jenny! [Jenny] Miriam, keep her quiet! [heavy breathing] [grunting] [suspenseful music] [dispatcher] All units possible 211 in progress 6378 Route 124. Copy that. I'm pretty close anyway. I'll go check it out. There's nothing out here. [dog barking] [heavy breathing] [loud grunting] [heavy breathing] [crying] [Katherine] Help! Help! Help! Help me, please! Help! [cries] [siren wailing] [Jenny] We're clear. All good. Help, help! [sighing] God, please. No, please. [breathing heavily] [Katherine] Put it down. You don't have to do this. I'll help you. I'll help you. I will. You don't have to do this. You don't want to do this. You don't have to do this. It can be over. [struggling to breathe] - [choking] - [suspenseful music] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [phone chiming] [heavy breathing] [gun firing] What the fuck was that? [banging on door] Miriam! [breathing heavily] Shut her up! This wasn't supposed to be here. It's, it's not registered. - [Derek] Hey man, it wasn't your fault. - No, it's not fucking okay, Derek. For once something isn't fixable okay, your friend is dying. [Derek] Fucking torch the place. Burn the evidence. [Ian] No, we're not leaving her here. Okay? [Derek] What do you want to do? Take her to the hospital and go to jail... - We're not fucking leaving her here, okay? - Fuck you, Ian! Stop arguing, all right? Help me get her in the car. You get the fire going. Let's go! [groaning in pain] [groaning] [Jenny] Okay, I got her. Okay, I'll drive. [car horn honking] Come on, Derek! Come on! [ominous music] - [Derek] How is she doing? - [Jenny] Conscious, but not good. - What are we going to do? - You're going to be all right, Miriam. We're going to get you to a hospital. You're going to be fine. - We can't go to a hospital. - She's going to die if we don't, Derek! If we take her there, we're fucked. You don't think the cops will start asking us questions? [Ian] We can handle the cops. [Derek] No. It's way too suspicious. They'll start poking around. [Derek] We got to do something about her. [Ian] Do something? Listen to yourself, okay? This is our friend, Derek! [Derek] We can't fucking take her there, all right? What are we going to do? [Ian] You're all right, Miriam. We're careful, all right? We're careful. [Derek] Ian, we can't take her back. We've got to get rid of her. - [struggling to breathe] -I can't believe you guys are fucking saying this! She's still alive! We can save her! Please, please! [Derek] It's either her or us! [Ian] Look at me. Look at me, okay? Listen. We've got this, just chill the fuck out. - [Derek] No, no, no. We can't make that choice! - She's going to die, Derek! [Miriam struggling to breathe] [Derek] Listen to me! We can't take her to the hospital! [screams] Look at me, Ian. Ian! Do you want to spend the rest of your life in jail? Guys! It's too late. She's gone. Fuck! Fuck, fuck! Now what? - Ian! - [Jenny] We could stage a robbery and then kill her. It wouldn't be perfect but her dad keeps a shotgun in the study. No. Slugs are way too much of a mess. Derek, we can do this! We have about three hours before her blood starts pooling. Okay, okay. This might work. What are we talking about? Her parents will hear us. They'll know. No, they won't. We sneak in, get Miriam into her bedroom, shoot her, steal a bunch of shit then get the hell out of there. Yeah, dispatch, that 211 was a prank call. That lady was not happy about me waking her up at this time of night. [dispatcher] Nobody appreciates us. Why don't you head on back? Will do. Dispatch, we got a fire at the Lauderback place. Get me fire out there right now, god damn it! Shit. [siren wailing] [labored breathing] [Derek] Yeah, I got it. - Watch your step! - [Derek] Wait, why not just kill her parents? Problem solved. [Ian] No, we're not killing them. I got her keys. [Ian] Okay, me and Jenny are going to take care of her. - What? - You're staying out here. All right? I don't want to wait out here. It's fucking cold! You're fucking staying out here, Derek. Okay? You're lookout. - Take her. - I got her. Just stick to the plan. Should we undress her? I'll do it. Go get the gun. - I think we have a problem. - What? There's no exit wound. The bullet's still in there. This doesn't work with another bullet in there. We have to get it out. [Ian] We need to extract it. Do you want me to do it? No, I'll do it. You just... You get rid of the bloody clothes. Okay? Mess some stuff up downstairs. I don't know, maybe make, make the robbery look convincing. And then, go tell Derek to pull the car up. [suspenseful music] Derek? What are you doing here? Is everything okay? You okay, Derek? Is everything all right? What's going on, man? Are you good? - [gun firing] - [gasping awake] [grunting] [mom] Kirk! Honey! Stay there! Oh, my god! Derek? Jenny? Jenny, what's going on? [grunt] [Jenny] Oh, baby. [Ian] Derek! Go take care of him! [suspenseful music] [gun firing] [grunting] [gun cocking] [Kirk] Ian, what are you doing? You weren't supposed to be involved in this, Mr. Randall. [Kirk] Ian, this isn't you. You don't know who I am. You don't know anything about me. You don't know what I'm capable of. You don't even know who your own daughter was. Ian, don't do this. - Stop saying my name! - Ian! [gun firing] - [dramatic music] - [breathing heavily] Derek? What happened? What happened, Jenny? What happened? What happened to him? Derek's dead. We are done. This is done. Ian, I need you to get it together right now. We have an insurance plan, remember? Put this on Vollman just like we planned. We have a plan? Jenny, the plan went to shit. How are we going to put this on Vollman, if Vollman's not here? - He'll be here! - He'll be here. How's he going to be here at this time, Jenny? - He'll be here. - [Ian] Oh? I texted him from Miriam's phone. He'll be here. Trust me. [suspenseful electronic music] - [heavy breathing] - [Jenny] Take care of her. Finish her off. I'll start clean-up. Yeah. No, no, no! No, no, no, no. Don't do this! It's Miriam's mom. - Please don't do this, no! - [Jenny] How does this work if she's still alive? [crying] It doesn't. - But the plan doesn't work. - Ian, she's no different than any of the others. - Come on. - Please! [Jenny] We're running out of time. Come on. [crying] I, I can't do it. [crying] - I can't do it. - [Jenny] Ian! I can't lie to my Dad. Not about Derek, he'll know. No. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. You can't lie to your dad? It doesn't work. It's not going to work, Jenny. I think it will. [gun firing] [gasping] No, no, no, no! Jenny? Okay, Jenny? Jenny! Jenny, Jen, Jen. Jenny, I don't know what's happening but you don't have to do this. It's over, okay? They're all gone. You don't have to do this! It's done! Honey, I'm your best friend's mom! You don't want to do this! No! [screams] [gun firing] [dramatic music] Hey, baby. You okay? [groans in pain] [suspenseful electronic music] [dispatcher] We have a report of shots fired at 43 Whitaker. Dispatch, confirm that address, please. [dispatcher] 43 Whitaker. Jesus Christ. [Vollman] Hello? Uh. Hello? [Jenny] Mr. Vollman. Um, Jenny, um, let's just put the gun down. Okay? Where's, um, where's Miriam, Jenny? Is someone hurt? Jenny, are you okay? I killed him. Is someone hurt? - [Jenny laughing] -Jenny, I'm just going to take this. [Jenny laughing] I just need you to give me the gun. [Jenny screams loudly] Drop the gun! [gun firing] [Jenny sobbing] [Jenny sobbing] [Mike] Shh, shh. It's okay.
