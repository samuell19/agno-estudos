I'm Mr. Trinh. Lieutenant Calhoun. Well, let's not waste time. I have the information about the anti-aircraft guns now active in this area. I don't envy your job, Mr. Trinh. Well, being a double agent has its rewards, Lieutenant. Let's move! No birds, no animal sounds. The jungle is always alive. Cover! Cover! Calhoun! Lieutenant! We must not stay here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Morey, check out the back of this place. Jesus Christ! LT, look at this! That's a raid till of gold! There must be at least 10 million back there. Surrender this, motherfucker! Hey. Almost Miller time? Sheraykov. I'm okay, Chief. Rodeo time. One of your friendly tribesman friends? Hell, if I didn't know better, I'd say they were on our side. Not all tribesmen are friendly, Lieutenant. Mountain's know, it's rabbit's foot. Start easing towards the river. Hey, goddammit! My friend. Your presence here offends me. Take them away. My fuhrer. I've been fighting my head all day trying to come up with a plan to get back in there. Trinh here's got some interesting information on the area. The raid tribesmen who attacked us swear allegiance to Chard, a mysterious white man. A round eye? Yes, he deals with NVAs, VCs, ARVNs. Even your own CIA. All he insists is that they stay away from these raid's sacred areas. The caves? Yes, because the gold in this caves is all these hill people will trade for. Well, that explains the attack on the NVA. In a week's time or soon as the monsoon raid stops, they've scheduled a bombing mission to blast this area into no man's land. Well, they can't delay the mission? They can't. There's a lot more at stake than just the lives of your two men. Look, Colonel, all I'm asking for is one last chance. What if I was able to get in there and get out before the bombing started? How you gonna get in and out that quick? Dalak Valley's too hot for choppers. It took you a week and a half just to walk in last time. I'll come up with something. If you're willing to risk your life, you've only got two weeks left in this man's war. Hell, I'll cut any orders I can to help. I appreciate it, sir. Hey, cowboy. What do you say, slick? What'll you have, a beer? Nah, let me, let me have a shot of that John. Heard about your boys. Too bad. Yeah, that was a bad deal. Looks like you're getting a little local entertainment tonight? They come in here every night spoiling for trouble. How in the world did Hell's Angels make it all the way down here? Well, it seems they bet some other gang that could ride their hogs straight to hell and live to tell about it. That's one way to make money, I guess. Ain't the half of it. They're smuggling horse back into the world. That could be dangerous. Trouble is, the MPs found out about that gig and warned the locals not to deal with 'em, and then they confiscated their Harleys. No wonder why they look rather pissed. It's the MPs that are really after them. But anything in uniform is fair game. Well, they might've found what they're looking for. I know those special forces boys, and I tell you what, they're some of the toughest sons of bitches I ever had the pleasure of meeting. They're all mine, get lost! Take it easy, Sam! Okay, stay back, I'll take care of this. See him? Come on, I'll beat the shit out of you, you little soldier asshole. Fuck you, man, come on, come on! Take it easy! Go time! Go, go, go! Insanity. Have you gone crazy, recruiting a bunch of outlaws? You know what they call themselves, don't you? One percenters, you know what that means? Yes, sir, I do. It's the 1% that don't fit in and don't care. That's right. Look, Colonel, it's the fourth quarter. We're running out of time. Now with motorcycles we can start here, get into the valley and get out in five days. And those outlaws can outride anybody this side of Honolulu. What about gas, you couldn't bring enough in there. No, I've taken care of that. There's an underground outpost approximately here, and they've agreed to supply us with fuel and drop it here at this deserted fortress. It's about halfway. You think you can actually handle four Hells. They're tough bastards. I won't take that away from them, but they wanna go home, and I figure I can cut 'em a deal. What kinda deal? I don't know, a deal deal, hell, maybe they're Republicans. All right. If you can convince those degenerate bastards, I'll give you all the support I can. Thank you, sir. Not possible, no, no. Run, bring in prisoner! What's happening, green boy? What is this, who the fuck are you? Well, it hardly matters, you can call me Calhoun if you like. Calhoun! So what's this all about, Calhouny? I can get you outta here. Yeah, in exchange for what? For your time. Doing what? Getting rich. Yeah right. Aw, fuck you, man. There's now you, a job. What the hell's that? See for yourself. It's real all right. There's a hell of a lot more where that came from. About $10 million worth. I need some guys that can ride bikes. We go in. We get the gold. And we come out with as much as we can carry. That's the deal. Don't fuck with me, soldier boy, or I'll break that tight little ass for you. Hey, pal, if you're not interested, I'll find somebody else that is. I didn't say I wasn't interested, asshole. I just said don't fuck with me, that's all. Well what's it gonna be, y'all in or not? 10 million bucks in gold? How much is that, Bonelli? It's two million apiece, Einstein. A little less than two million. There's five of us here, that's two mil a piece fair and square. Yeah, we're gonna need a mechanic, though. All right, then 1,666,666 dollars and 66 cents it is, each. Hey, hey, amigo. That's my style, a million dolares? So when do we get out of this crossbar hotel here? Soon as you pay the damages. No, no, no, no, no. You pay the damages, and you get our bikes. Capiche-ki? Fair enough. You'll get your bikes. I'll send a driver for you in the morning, be ready. Hey, Calhouny, you got four Hell's Angels for five days, that's it. You best not be pulling my dick about this gold shit. Just be ready. Where can I find Hickman at? Over there. Thanks. Dammit! Goddamn motherfucker! Calhoun! How the hell you been, long time no see? How you doing, Hickman? Last time I saw you, we almost got our asses shot off. Ha, got a little adventure, wasn't it? Hell yeah. You been a busy boy lately. Three silver stars, two gold with clusters, a purple heart. I also heard you would've got that Congressional Medal of Honor if that C.O. Smith hadn't been such a racist bastard. Calhoun, you know better than to believe all that John Wayne shit you been hearing about me. Get out in the bush, VC come at you and you're flipping on rock and roll, do what you gotta do. Besides, you know, I'm allergic to dying. So you going home pretty soon, aren't you? Yeah. I got one little piece of unfinished business, though, before I go. Yeah, what's that? You remember Morey and Sherayko? Hell yeah, hell yeah, they should be home by now, shouldn't they? I wish they were, pardner, I wish they were. Look, man, I know you got six weeks left. I'm not gonna pull orders on you. You know me better than that. But I need a mechanic, and I need one bad. One that can handle his ass in the bush. Well, who else you gonna get? Does it matter? No, I guess not. Well, you got yourself a mechanic. Don't get my ass killed, though. My mom'd be real pissed off. She wouldn't understand me dying for some cracker peckerwood. Well, there is one thing. What's that? Don't ever call me a cracker again. Crackers are from Georgia, son. I'm from West Texas. Now you can call me a redneck peckerwood any time. Okay, you redneck peckerwood! What is this, no, I just want to know what this is, because these are not our bikes, man. These are not, not, not our bikes! What the hell gives, man? They're your bikes. They're your new bikes. Bullshit, these are toys! These are not Harleys. You assholes don't know shit. He knows what he's doing. Your pigs wouldn't make it two clicks in the bush. I don't fucking believe this! Bonelli, check it out! They'll fucking work. After the chopper drops us off here, we go onto an abandoned fortress right here. There'll be some undergrounds that'll provide us with fuel. From there we go on to Lu Duk village here. We meet up with a Vietnamese agent who'll brief us on the area. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Now we're down to a million, 428,571 dollars and 43 cents. Hey, you got any better offers, chump? Wait a minute, who is this guy? I'm your mechanic. Well, can you ride, boy? Yeah, I can ride, white boy. You worry about your own ass. This is Hickman, he's a sawbones for the bikes and he's one hell of a combat soldier. Man, I am sick up to here with this military bullshit. Why don't we just go in, get the goddamned gold, and get out? Hey, hey, hey. Let's get one thing straight right now. You may know bikes, but I know the jungle, and y'all may be tough, but I know combat, and let me tell you something, there's a big difference. You do what I tell you when I tell you. And there's a good chance that we can get up there and get back in one piece, and finish the job that we started. Now get some rest, five hundred comes quick. That's, five o'clock to you freaks. Yeah, yeah. Colonel. You know, that was pretty good. Your telling that MP colonel that your angels were CIA operatives just back from Laos and had to be debriefed. Do they know about the prisoners yet? No, no I figured I'd wait and tell 'em until they were in there. Hickman knows. Well, I'm sure glad I'm not gonna be around when they find out how you double shifted 'em. I don't want to be around for that either, I'm telling you that's a tough little group there. You know, you got one chance in a thousand of pulling this off, Vance. Good luck. Well, I figure I owe those men there, sir. Well, if I don't hear from you in a week's time, I'll arrange a proper funeral for you, son. Thank you, sir. Hold on, boys, here we go, just hold tight. How's it look? Lost a tire, but we're a sitting duck out here. Well, back off, maybe we can take 'em. Goddamn, I think they hit the rudder. I'm gonna have to set you down someplace near here. Hickman, I have to sit you down now. The gunfire's too much. Man, let's get out of here, come on! Let's head for the bush! After that welcoming committee we got, you can bet your ass they know we're here. We're gonna have to haul ass, boys, let's do it. (explosion roaring. Come on! Shit! Spread out! The perimeter's clear, nobody out there. Hey man, you didn't tell us about this shit. What's the situation like out there? Shit, perimeter's all clear, but I set up a trip wire anyway. Good, why don't you get something in your stomach? Now listen up, I'll take the first watch. Hey man, where's my poncho? Bonelli, you take the second watch. Larger, you take the third. Wait a minute, wait a fucking minute, man. Nobody tells the Hell's Angels what to do except me. Unless, of course, you know, you want to prove yourself. Ain't that right, Bonelli? Fuck yeah. Come on, man! Beat the shit out of him! Come on, that's it, yeah! Get that son of a bitch! That's it, come on, get him, sonny, get him! Hit 'em! You got him already, man! Sonny, don't let him do that to you, man. Don't let that guy do it! Get him, sonny, come on, come on, sonny! Sonny, aw, yeah, yeah, right! Come on. Sonny, what are you doing? Man, come on! Shit. Come on, man, come on! Come on! Shit! Shit! Land mine! Come on, baby. Help me, help me! Fuckers, fuck you! Come on, baby. You fuckers, fuckers, fuck you! Fuck you! Shit! Carmody, get the fuck over here. Maybe somebody'd like to say something, I mean, I didn't know him, he was y'all's friend. What are you looking at me for? Alright. We are gathered here to. That's not right, what a minute. I have known. Bonelli, say something! Turko was a crazy son of a bitch, man. He rode with us for eight years, seven months and 14 days. You know, they say good things come from bad things, and they do, because now our shares are worth one six again, which is nice. So for that, we thank you, brother. Amen? Amen. Amen. Amen. All quiet, LT. Good deal. There you go. Carmody. Thanks. Some crackers. What are you cooking up over there? It's pizza, man. Pizza? Ain't bad. Check it out. Here, it's a piece of cake. What else you got in there, man? Some peanut butter. You got any bread? Nah, some crackers. Hick, you got any more coffee? What day is it? It's, um, Thursday. It's the 24th. Hey, it's the 24th, man. So, what's the 24th? It's Thanksgiving. That's where we're supposed to pick up our gas. What is it, what's wrong? I don't know. It's too quiet, something ain't right. Let's ease down there and check it out. No guns. Hey, thanks a lot. You okay? You sure? We can be sure of two things. They know we're here and that you helped us. And when their men don't show, they're gonna come back for you. And things could get real dangerous. I know, but we're committed to what we believe in. That wasn't the first time. I'm so sorry about your friend. This is our way of life. Take care of yourself. Let's mount up! Aw shit, what now? We jump it. Well, who wants to go first? Alright. Alright, I'll do it. Go for it, Bonelli. Piece of cake man, come on! I can do that. Alright! See you on the other side, LT! What do you say we save some time and jump in tandem? I'm game. Yeah! What happened here? The raids, they came to punish us for helping you. They wanted to know when you will come back for the prisoners. Prisoners? Go ahead, and finish. The white man was with them. I saw him from afar. Chard? What else do you know about him? He is a devil's guard. What's this devil's guard? It's a battalion of the French foreign legion. Ex-Nazis, SS agents, bad, bad people. They used to fight the Vietnamese back in the 50s. Hey, I would like to know about the prisoners. They took them to the camp. Hey, wait a minute, Calhoun. I thought we were coming up here for the gold, man. No, you come back here to rescue your men, didn't you? I fucking knew it. You see, Carmody, his type doesn't help our type, no, not unless of course there's something in it for him. Hey, hey, hey, hey, he was just watching out for his brothers, man, the same as you. No, that's not the point, the point is, he wasn't straight with us, he lied to us, and that's bullshit. Right on, Larger, these two assholes think they can do whatever they want to with us. Well, be that as it may, we're still a couple hundred clicks inside enemy territory. I'll go on alone if I have to. You're free to go for the gold or haul ass or whatever suits you. We'll have a hell of a lot better chance together. Together? Fuck you man, we've never been together. Carmody, get the guide. I'm going for the gold. There's the cave, still up there. There's the cave. Hey, Larger, look at these skulls, they're cool! They're all over the place. I'm taking some of these home. Load the crates, and let's go. The gold, the gold! Look! Right! Gentlemen. Are you looking for something? Take them. Morey. Who in the fuck are they? You are not soldiers. You are an undisciplined rabble. Who came with you? You're gonna regret the day you took on the Hell's Angels, asshole. I already do, but you must admit your title, Hell's Angels? It has a certain savoir faire ring to it. Tell Colonel Chin we have three more American prisoners. We will see what he will pay for them. Strange, you know, this country changes you. Here I am out here risking my ass for a redneck and three Hell's Angels. People I probably wouldn't even talk to at home. Well, I can't argue with you. I'd much rather be up to my ass in cow shit right now. Doesn't help Morey and Sherayko though, does it? Chung, is that you? I'm ready. What do you got for me, partner? LT? Got charges strung all around this perimeter. Do you know where the ammo bunker is? It's over between them huts. By those fuel tanks? Yes sir. That's perfect. What's your plan, what are you gonna be doing? Smoke a little peace pipe with the natives. Calhoun, is that you? Yeah, keep it down. You son of a bitch. Alright. Listen to me carefully. All hell's gonna break loose here in the morning. Do you know where they're keeping your guns? Yeah. Okay. When things start popping, go for those guns and try and make it to the bikes. Calhoun. I'll see you on the outside. Lieutenant Calhoun? You have studied our customs well. You knew my men would not kill you if you came unarmed into my camp. You are my guest, and you are safe. For now, Lieutenant. Why are you here bothering me, Calhoun? I'm a busy man. You deal, don't you? I wanna make a deal to get my men out. And if I won't deal? Then I'll just have to kill you. You intrigue me, Lieutenant. Take a look around you, I control everything you see. To these people, I am a living God, their fuhrer. They found me when the VC had left me for dead and nursed me back to health. You're a goddamn lunatic. You killed two dozen NVA down at that cave, people who were loyal to you. Doesn't that mean anything? They were nothing, they found something they should not have. Precious metal is a sign of leadership to these people. Unless, of course, you are a deity, like I am. Well, I'm happy for you, but that, doesn't solve my problem with getting my men out of here. Your men? Your men, Lieutenant, have been sold to the NVA. They leave today. And as for these. They may add a little sport for the VC. And who knows, Lieutenant? With their motorbikes, they may be considered a secret weapon. You're an intelligent man, resourceful, brave. Why not join me? Go to hell. Outside these walls, you are nobody, you are nothing. Why, even your own people do not care about you. Don't bet on it. Nein. Nein, there are more of them out there. That bastard is not alone. This bastard is up to something, I know it. You, you, up there, quick, quick, the back, the back go go! Come on, hurry up, hurry up! You move, I'll drop you like a rock. Go for the guns! Calhoun! Damn you, Calhoun. The game has begun! It is my move! You may be a worthy adversary, Calhoun, but you're a dead man! It'll be sweet to kill you, you son of a bitch! To the caves! Now go go go, they're in, they're in, now go! Come on, hurry it up! Enough, let's go! I want them alive! Jesus Christ, do you hear that? Shit, goddammit. Forget about it, man, they're history, let's get outta here. They're never gonna make it on their own. You guys are gonna think I'm crazy. Aw, what are you doing? There's no way we're gonna be able to carry those dumbass GIs and the gold with us, don't do this to me, man. All my life, I never gave a shit about anything or anybody, nothing. I guess that's what wearing colors is all about. Fuck it! You guys ready for a little fun? Yeah. Yeah. I can't hear you. Yeah! Yeah! Let's move the fuck out. Fuck that shit. Let's kick ass! Alright! Yeah! Let's start again. What do you think? I think we can all make it across there. Tell you what, I'll go first, check it out. I'm gonna try to jump it, man. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah! It's cool, man, come on. Bonelli! Bonelli! Come on, come on, he's gone, let's! Larger! Come on! Your move, Calhoun. Shall we? I believe I will. Calhoun! Calhoun! Calhoun! Game's over, you lose.
