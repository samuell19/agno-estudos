That's what I keep asking myself. You, you owned a swinging club in London a while ago, right? I did indeed, yes. The Soho-A-Gogo. And I blew it all for this. - Hey, you're Cliff Donner? - Guilty. Well, shake hands with another loser. I'm president of the club, Stanley Krumley. - Hi. - How long you been off the bag? Since my 'Favorites of the 40s' album hit the shops. Became an overnight has been at 24. Yes, the kids turn you off when they share you with mum and dad. 'Yeah.' Guess you'd not be interested if you can make the scene again. Nope, I'm through with that bag. But you had them screamin' for two years, you can do it again-- I got a job waitin' for me in LA with the record company I owned. Don't blow your cool. Sudden withdrawal can be dangerous. Taper off. Get it out of your system gradually. What do you mean? Sing here for a week. Not a chance. I'm stayin' clean.

Oh, excuse me, but it's these darn shorts my wife always buys 'em a size too small. And your promises are a little skimpy too. If you'd only give me a chance, you-you'll be a star maker. Look, hon, I ask you, go out and make a record. Get it on the charts. You know you two would make a great ventriloquist act only I can't tell which one of you is the dummy. Oh, that's nice. That's very nice. You're a very hostile little girl, aren't you? The word is "determined," Mr. MacElwaine. Hallie, if you aren't on stage when the cage number begins you're fired. - Right, Mr. MacElwaine? - Right. Right. Oh...I hope your wife puts starch in your shorts. - 'Here comes Cinderella.' - Steve, here she is. - Where the hell have you been? - Oh, guess. - Well, you should have told me. - I stopped raising my hand. What did Mr. MacElwaine say? Just as if I couldn't tell by your face. Oh, sweetie, there's a time and a place for everyone. Even me, I think. Don't you worry. Back to your pins and needles, grandma. On stage, Patrick. And the next time you pull that I'll see you dancing in the unemployment line. 'Psycho chick.' - I know where you were. - I'm not gonna flip. - I'm not going to flip. - This is a boy's world. Isn't it enough to be with them all the time? And get paid for it. Cue announcer.

Right. Alright, the cage is open. Now, fly. You're fired. But...oh, one of these days you're gonna beg me to sing on Whizbam, that's a promise. Correction, a fact. Promises, you don't understand. I'd have been very disappointed if she hadn't said that. It's called "famous last words." [snapping fingers] - So, how's your mother? - Big deal. I thought the show was great. You were never my age. Hallie, I realize it's hard, but don't give up. I've been trying for 30 years. They haven't ground me down yet. Thanks, Mrs. Miller. I won't. [humming] You feel guilty? Do you? - Yeah, a little. - Oh, so do I...a little. What could I do? I mean what? Well, tell me, what?

I'm gonna tell you for the last time, you dirty old man. I don't want to dance. Now, I remember. It was at the Roller Jubilee. No. Okay, Daddy Warbucks, go play with sickos your own age, huh? Get out of here before I put you to your draftboard. - We've been in already. - Oh, yeah. But not on our side. Now blow. B-L-O. You're next, go solve your problem some place else, huh? - I'm sorry. - I forgive you. Now cut. Hold on, Cliff. She was all ears until that paranoid opened his mouth. I only came here, Cliff Donner, to listen to you. Well, you're a loud listener. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, you're the bird from that Whizbam Show tonight, right? All you had to do was ask. If you wanna hate me, stand in line. - Oh, no, I want to talk to you. - Hallie, let's get out of here. I'll meet you back at the motel. Which motel? Hey, take it easy. I mean, tell me a few lies first. Like, play the game. Hey, Stan, the girl from the Whizbam Show. You're kidding. The one that did the new dance? - She must've come for practice. - What new dance? That wiggy thing you did on the show. I didn't dig it, but everybody else sure did. Yes, the kids were flipping. Come on, finish your tonic. Alright, fellas, that's enough for the night. Home to mother. Oh...oh, you don't think that thing I did on the show tonight was on purpose, do you? 'The producer welshed on his promise to let me sing' - And I just lost control-- - And you wigged like ape, huh? Well put. You're joking, of course. - Do you remember what you did? - Not really, why? Because I do. Now.. If there was only a name for what you did. A mistake, that's what they call it, Cliff. She had a fit. How's that, huh? No. no. That is kind of sick. Ah, no-no, not fit. No, she just lost her temper. - She had a tantrum. - That's it. Look, you're playing password, mind letting me in on this? "The Tantrum," Hallie, that's the name of your new dance. But I don't want to dance, I want to sing. You will. Right, Stan? Meet your new manager. - Manager? - Manager? No, no, hold on. There's a million dollar sitting right there. - How much? - A million bucks at least. Tax free? It's alright. I'll pay the taxes. - You just shut up and listen. - I'm listening, I'm listening. Okay, The Tantrum plus Hallie Rogers plus The Leaves. - Plus Cliff Donner. - Wait, it doesn't include me. But-but you two would be the wildest together. Look, I'll produce the session, but like I said, I'm out of it. I'll get my kicks from helping. Hallie's good enough on her own. She doesn't need a crutch. I'll get my jacket, I'll take you home. He's flying kind of low right now. - He doesn't know what he wants. - But we do, don't we, Stan? Hm, don't worry. He'll change his mind. Well, he better, because if he doesn't who's going to teach me how to do The Tantrum? Don't look at me. Hmm, I'd say, being broke has its advantages. I can't seem to make you understand. That's all there is left after two years. You don't scare me any, I still want to make it as a pop singer. Like, it's kind of a peculiar drive for a girl but when you want something, you can't just sit around waiting. I think you'll be great. - Thought you'd never get here. - Everything alright? [screaming] I-I mean, for example, now you were frantic. Like-like what a sound, I scream for you. - They'll scream for you too. - Hey, aren't you coming in? - Water's great - Later. But don't you still want all that love and attention? - You're a tiger, aren't you? - Don't joke, I'm serious. [laughing] I know you are. I'm enjoying the program very much. - Oh, you're making fun of me. - No, I'm not. I think you're wild. Oh, come on, Cliff. What can it hurt? Besides, you might get to like singing with me. - Well? - I'll think about it. Oh, you rat face. Oh, you'll never get away with it. Oh, I'm never gonna forgive you as long as I live. Oh, you ding-a-ling. [man on PA] 'And now, more of the full band sound to start your day.'

He's managed all the top recording stars in the country from the age of 17. D-does she need him? Huh! Is he really your brother, Stan? Either that or one of us was suckled by a very kind stranger.

My shadows. Okay, let's split. My scooter is waiting. Now, you go with Tony and tell him about the dance and the club and get him to come over tonight. And take that disgusted look off your face. He'll think you're not interested. - I'm not sure I'm. - Oh. Tony, I have to go.. I've got a grand little club, and I've got a new act. It will absolutely deck you. Oh, it's so good to see you. - So good to see you. Huh.. - Crazy, man. Crazy, crazy. You see Stan's idea's to make the clubtheplace to dance. Since we're the ones, we and the kids who know the Tantrum, we've got something really new and wild. Now, the only thing the idea needs is, isform, style. Your kind of style, Tony. That magic touch of yours. - Louise. - Don't lose your cool, Hallie. You'll probably talk to him into unconsciousness. He's really out to lunch. Hey, fella. You alright? What's the matter? What did you say to him? - I-I-I was just.. - Charlie. Charlie, he's stiffened up again. Louise. We gotta call Louise. She's the only one who can help. Louise. Louise. Here, Tony, it's Louise. Louise? It's Tony. No, I-I just got back. I've missed you, Louise. Oh, no. Don't put me off that way, Louise, or I'll know that.. I will know that.. You are what? My baby. You cryin'. Louise.. [sighs] ...is pregnant. Oh, well, that's-that's wonderful. Isn't it? Well, I mean, you'll get used to it, really. And you'll even grow to love it. - Louise is not his wife. - Oh. - Girlfriend? - No. - His analyst. - Oh. [Tony whining] Baby, please stop torturing yourself. There'll be others. I've heard people falling in love with their psychiatrists. You call what he's doing love? It's the most common transference. You see, Tony is the youngest living tycoon. I mean, he's practically a teenager himself. And what's more, he became a millionaire when he was only 17 years old. [Dee Dee] 'He's ambivalent, doesn't know he's a kid or an old rich man.' Consequently, he doesn't know whether he wants to be Louise's baby, her husband or her father. Please, baby. Stop torturing yourself. She's not worth it. - Even at $50 an hour. - How could she do this to me? I tell you, it's that sneaky husband of hers. It isn't fair! Hnn. Hnn. Anything else, Tony baby? Yeah, tonight. We're going to my brother's club. We're gonna tighten up on that new bag. - The Tantrum. - Hmm. Make the arrangements. [playing "The Tantrum"] [music continues] [music continues] Okay. Come on, Romeo. Look, I'll call you when I get settled. Where will you be? At your place? - I-I don't know. I guess so. - Yeah, come on. What's the scene? You're gonna be meeting us in LA, aren't you? - What for? - What for? - Yeah. - What for? Uh, Stan, didn't you, uh? No, you didn't. Cliff, I want the team. I want the team. It's the team or nothing. There is no team. Well, I guess it's nothing. Well, thank you, Ms. Rogers. Thank you for a most groovy evening. Hey, look, Tony. Hallie is the girl who created "The Tantrum." It is getting warm standing here. - I feel like a-- - It's okay, Cliff. It's sure not like you promised. Oh, well, I think it's a feeling that last night was as much kicks for you as it was for me. - Look, it was, I just don't-- - It's okay. It's okay. Hey, Tony. Come on. Hey, Tony, where do I meet ya? Oh, the Sunset Towers on Sunset Strip. What room number? Room number? The floor number is seven. Plenty of time to be grateful later on, child. How long does it take to get spiced in the state? - Three days. - What? - Boy, what a scene. - You mean like the whole truth? You are going to get married and chirp to each other. [Charlie] 'Tony baby, you're out of sight.' - I'm so proud of you. - But-but why? Why? It's love, baby, love. Yeah, that is what every bird wants. To find somebody to love. See now, you and Cliff, you will start off just dancing together, you know. And then, when they really get to know you and identify then, you will start singing together. God, it'll be like the whole bag is just happening right before their eyes. Romance. You and Cliff. You are going to sing to each other with love. "Cliff and Hallie are going steady." Then, we announce the engagement. You are going to turn those kids on, I think so they just want to go right out and buy it. Yeah, "Romance, True Love." None of that phony Hollywood garbage. No, we're with you, super boy. We're with you. Hm, uh, tell ya it's the big plan. I conceived it last night after I talked to Louise on telephone. It's financial gusher, only. In order to make it work, all three phases, love, engagement and marriage must be completed. But-but I don't want to get married yet. Wait.. Oh, lis-listen. I've got it. Yeah. Yeah, we'll hold off on the marriage, but, yes we'll take it slow, you know, bit by bit. And then, if something goes wrong well, we don't have to bother with any messy divorce. Yeah, wait! Wait, wait, wait. "A singing teenage divorce." No, no, no. Please. Now look, Hallie. I took a bastard in my club to be in on this deal. Now look, Tony hasn't missed yet. Nine stars he's made in one year. The only question you gotta ask yourself is how badly do I need this whole bag? Even if I go along with it, you'll never get Cliff to. - Well, I won't, but you will. - Me? What do you mean? Well, see, you are going to turn it on this fox. You are going to make Cliff take the big fall for you so that when I push the button, those wedding bells will ring. - But I could never do that. - Look, wait a minute. Now I have two buttons to push. One starts this plan rolling tonight, the other kills it. But what if I can't handle it? [chuckles] Oh. [sighs] You will handle it. Man, that sure is a wild car. Yeah, it's okay if you like white cars. [siren wailing] Hey, what kept you? Oh, you must have flew. No, you flew. I took the back road. Nobody likes a smart-- [car horn honks] Oh, Mr. Krum.

How come? Because you haven't stopped talking long enough. That's why. Do you have any idea how happy I am? Yeah, I think so. Nothing like a little success to cure what ails you.

Just one second, I wanna talk to you. Okay. Cliff, would you get my things? - I'll go as I am. - Sure. - Come help me, Stan. - Okay! Oh, you. Ha ha ha. Oh, baby, chick, you really are zero cool. Oh, I knew you could do it, but so quick. Please, Tony, don't remind me of that. Na-na-na. No foolish guilt. You're not going to throw a seven on me. All you did was give cupid a little shove. But it's different now. I really love him. Okay, what's the difference? The important thing is that you have made him fall in love with you. Just like I said you could. Now, we will be ready to announce the engagement in just a couple of weeks. - What's the matter, brother? - Nothing, big mouth. Cliff just heard every word you said to her. And he's long gone. Oh..

[panting] [dramatic music] Cliff, Cliff.. I-I just, I don't have any excuses for what I did but I didn't wanna do it. I really didn't wanna do it. Please, believe that. It was either do it or Tony wouldn't back us. You're a fake, Hallie Rogers. - 'Cliff.' - Shut up! 'Now, you've made your little cop out already.' 'Now, it's my turn.' I don't know what it was that made you the way you are. I don't even know if I care anymore. You know, I knew what you were doing all along. I mean, you didn't fool me any. 'If you did, it was because I wanted to be fooled.' Cliff, I'm in love with you. Can't you even say you're sorry? Do you have to keep on lying? But I'm not lying. Not now. Oh, please, please, believe that. At first, yes, it was an assignment to get you to fall in love with me for the plan. 'But it's different now.' And the other day at Alvera Street.. ...I knew I was in love with you. The thought of you finding out and hating me for it scared me so I just figured if I could show you how much I love you.. ...I could wipe out the nasty way it began. But you found out before I could. - I'm really important to you? - Oh, yes. Well, you're the only thing that's important to me. - And you'll marry me? - Oh, yes. - Right now. - Yes. - Tonight. - Yes. - I don't believe you. - Oh, yes, you do. Yes, I do.

Just ask. Find Cliff. - And talk to him? - Only if you have to. - 'Oh, and Dee Dee.' - What? - The way you're dressed.. - Oh, well, I'll change. I'd never got to an assignment looking like this. That's right, but remember, when you come back that is the way I want you to look. My car, please. Where have you been? I walked from Hollywood because I didn't have any money. - It's great being a star. - You must be dead. I am, but not as dead as that brother of yours when I get through with him. Come on, we're going for a ride. - I just came back from one. - I want to talk to you. Oh, no, you don't. Get back. Hallie, look, nobody likes to get caught with their finger in the pie. That's what used to happen to me all the time. When Tony and I were kids. Tony put his finger in the pie and get away with it. When I did, mum would have me by the ear. Well, he picked the wrong pie this time. Because when I get my hand on his ear he's gonna look like Van Gogh. Well, it's done now. Let's see what we can salvage. Blowing your cool won't prove a thing. [bell rings] Oh, come in, baby. Forgive me. I, uh, just had to wash the day off. Why don't you make yourself comfortable while I, uh slip something on?

I spent a whole marriage there once. I should say honeymoon. Either way, that's all there was. If you decide to cut, where would you go? Hmm, Frisco, I guess. Come on, let's sit down. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I would. Got any wine? You're a man after my own heart. I have just the thing. [guitar music] Open it. [upbeat music] Ring, you rotten phone, ring. Why don't I get a report? - What the hell is that? - For you, leader. And I made it nice and warm, like Louise said. Oh, he's just a baby. I'm not defending him, mind you. But I've never seen him so shaken up since dad paddled his bare behind with my track shoes. I thought you said he never got caught at anything. He didn't. No, dad just liked to make him cry. Did you tell 'em you're not showin' up at the club tonight? Nope. I guess I should, though. What the hell ever got into her to let her herself get bullied into a hairy scheme like that? Well, she's young, ambitious and therefore, dangerous. It takes a few years on a girl to know how to mix a cocktail of ambition and desire. Yeah, I guess so. In the mean time.. ...a man could bleed to death. "And then, Dracula bit the pretty lady on the throat leaving two little holes in her neck." Now, don't you skip a thing, I know it all by heart. "And carried her to the cellar and placed her in his coffin." Ha, here comes the best part. And he covered her with dirt. Sure, I'm tired of getting dirt thrown on my face. But I want Cliff and I wanna make it in this business too. I'll settle for either one. Are you willing to give Tony another chance? If you want my advice, take.. The money, baby. Think of the money. Stick with Tony and the team. You won't take long, the way things are flying now. Then you'll be able to cut the cord and be on your own again. Dee Dee, no doubt you're making a lot of sense. Yes, baby. Gee, you smell good. I don't taste bad either, baby. [music continues] I don't know, they don't make 'em the way they used to. Oh, I love it, I love it. Oh, I'll be with you in a minute, love. There isnothing likedestruction derby to warm the heart and clear the sinuses. Hallie. Baby bird. Unaccustomed as I am to making apologies, there comes a time. Not that I have lost any faith in my judgment, you understand? But, you see, this is a gamble that we.. No, no, I...I had to take. So, if you can forgive.. ...I can forget. Well, I accept, on one condition. Which is? You help me square things with-- A-a-h, Cliff baby. [laughing] You know, I'm proud of you angel, proud. You must have done quite a job. It wasn't easy, it took all night, and then some. [snaps fingers] The meeting will now come to order. I tell you now the news that I have to impart should cure all wounds inflicted. Whizbam. You mean, they called us? Yes, it's all set, you're on next Saturday. Oh. And I want to try for new numbers at the Gogo for the album that we're recording next Friday night. 'Whizbam?' Is the meeting over? You could say thank you. I'll think about it. [dramatic music] Cliff, Cliff. Wait, please. I don't know why you came back, but I'm glad you did. Oh, it had nothing to do with you. I didn't think so. I only hoped.. Because everything I said in the bus was the truth. Look, Hallie, just play the game and leave me alone. You got what you want, now I'm gonna get what I want. But I don't have everything I want. How can I make you believe that? I love you. Well, that was an accident. Just like The Tantrum was.

Then you'll do without me. Go get her, Dee Dee. - What was all that about, huh? - Cliff, sit down. - I'll take care of this. - You really are dense.

I have just about turned you off. One more scene like last night, I'm canceling Whizbam. I'm cancelling the recording session. I am cancelling everything, and I shall send you the pieces of your contract when I have had the pleasure of tearing it up. Now, do we understand each other, sweetie bird? Yes, sweetie bird. One of these days, I-- - Now. - And you are going to be-- We have to think of some way to ensure absolute pandemonium for you two on Whizbam. Yeah. Something that will really hook those kids. How about, if they sing good? I've got it. I have, oh.. Yeah, escort, the speedway. Wheels, wheels, wheels. - Fingers. - 'What?' - Fingers. - Smash him, smash him. Right, yeah, destruction, the derby. What's that have to do with Cliff and me? Cliff, is going to be driving. I'd hate to die in front of only 10,000 blood thirsty nuts. Are you sure this is being televised? - Oh, in living color. - Yeah, black and blue. - Anything else? - Yeah, just one little thing. My driver's license expired last week. Oh, so, stay cool.

'They're really off the plot today.' '498 squeezing through the back approaching the turn.' 'Looks like Donner won't be scared off.' 'Number eight has a front wheel blow out.' 'He's off the track. He's okay, but out of the race.' 'Donahue has a locked wheel. He can't stay on the track.' 'What a pile up that could've been' 'anything goes in this race.'

'If I know Carruthers, he's not gonna be stopped by a novice.' 'Here comes Carruthers, he's closing in on Donner.' 'They're coming down to the checkered flag.' 'Donner and Carruthers.' 'Donner comes in up the track and crosses the finish line!' 'Oh-ho, what an upset.' 'The young singer gave our pros a driving lesson today.' [crowd applauding] 'Here to present the trophy and winner's bouquet' 'is Hallie Rogers.' 'Cliff's beautiful singing partner.' 'The fans are going wild.'

Only half of America heard you. [crowd cheering] Cliff! Cliff! Cliff! Greetings. About time you showed up. These kids have been waiting all afternoon since the derby. - Just chanting, like that. - Naturally. Oh, look who's here. How about your big stars, they're ready to go on? - Where's the bird? - The bird? Oh, yeah, the girl. Where's the girl? We haven't seen her all day, sir. She didn't even show up for dress rehearsal. What? Why don't you tell me these things? Howie, what are we gonna do about it? Uh, oh, uh.. Well, uh, don't let them go on, right? You happen to catch that scene at the derby today? - Yeah. - Yes. Alright, who needs her? Who needs her? Who needs her? Hey, are-are you, are you ready to go on alone, Donner? Oh, he's always ready to go on. 'Stand by, George, Cliff Donner is coming onstage.'

Where the hell do you think you're going? - She loves me, Tony. - No. You, wait one minute. Listen to me. Go right ahead and throw away your second chance. You are rid of the coup, Cliff baby. Listen to them, they're screaming for you. - Yes. - Doesn't matter. Don't you realize why Hallie didn't show up today, huh? She did it for me because she loves me. She's not hung up on this scene anymore. [male announcer] 'Whizbam presents Fisher and His Fish.' We're gonna sue you, Krum. We're gonna sue you for ten million dollars. - At least. - Don't you jitterbug with me. I am Tony Krum, nobody yells at me unless I say so. Now, what seems to be your problem? I think we got a pretty good problem. I shoved in the last group, after that we ain't got nothing. - Dead air. - Dead air. Oh, I see. Oh, yes, I.. ...see.
