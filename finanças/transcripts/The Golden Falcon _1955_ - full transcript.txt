THE GOLDEN FALCON The tourists who visit this city of Siena, get an impression of peace, serenity. Maybe because of the welcoming smiles of the Sienese or even better than that, the wonderful taste of its pastry. But no, it's the majestic art treasures evocative of the memory of Pia, made immortal by Dante and by advertising firms in 4 languages. But ladies and gentlemen, once upon a time, Siena wasn't like this. Danger existed there. The danger of turning a corner of a noble palace and running into swords lurking in ambush, brandished by masked men. Let's take for example, the history of this castle and go back to the time of the Crusades, to the day when Guidobaldo di Montefalco, called the Terror of the Moors and Ugo della Torre, the Scourge of the Saracens, met in their old city on their return from the Holy Land. Look at the poor fellows. They've been fighting for two days without rest. And note how the blows fall because they're tired. But who could declare it? Their houses' honor is at stake. Better they both die. And Fate will satisfy them: A good sword thrust from both and tradition is preserved. The reason for the quarrel? Oh, very serious. Very serious indeed! The first put in doubt the number of Saracens the second killed, the second sneered at the heroism of the first. And the descendants to avenge the offense, kill one another. When quarrels are left to the sword, the sword gives satisfaction to all. The years rolled by and with admirable single-mindedness, their descendants have been feuding ever since. They would have gone on forever if Lady Gertrude, widow of Raniero di Montefalco, thought it was time to put an end to it. And what was strange, her enemy, Ubaldo della Torre agreed with her. In fact, he let her know that he would receive her ambassadors. I don't know whether my poor dead husband would have acted so. But since this heavy inheritance has fallen on my weak shoulders, I'll do everything possible to reach a sincere and lasting peace. The armistices which have been pledged so far have never been very lasting. But now it's not an armistice, but a marriage. Excuse me, my lords. I think it's my son back from the hunt. Here they are. We've caught them this time and now they'll have to deal with us. These della Torre men! Go on, untie them! Hurry! These are the obstacles in the way of peace. Years of hatred and bloodshed are not forgotten so easily. We must confide in God's help. - And in the goodwill of men. Do you really feel our mission will be successful? I'm certain it will end in the best way. Tomorrow, we'll perfect the agreement. - As you wish. I've prepared your rooms for you. In the hospitality Montefalco offers you, is the first sign of a lasting peace. Treat them well, they're my hostages. You won't leave prison until you've given me satisfaction for that falcon you killed. Leave all to us, Don Massimo. In the dungeon, they'll keep very well. Take them away! Go! Don't worry, we won't harm a hair on your head. You've got too big a belly to be a brave soldier. We'll give you a diet: bread and water! Otherwise, there'll be a fear the rope will break when… No! No! Stop it! Stop it! That's no way to do things! No? Why? Because it's a pity to spoil those nice clothes with your big feet. Better take 'em off. What nice clothes! Go! I was provoked. I must take revenge. And tomorrow, the della Torre family will take their revenge on us. It's a vicious circle we must break! - Are you serious? We must forget the past in order to create a secure and peaceful tomorrow. With our mortal enemies? - If we wanted, they could become our most loyal friends. But…! My father, could you endure my sword rusting before the last of the della Torre were killed? If your father were alive now, he'd agree with me. Hatred generates hatred, as the Count Ubaldo della Torre has finally understood. That old della Torre! He feels the earth tremble beneath his feet. I bet he's been sending ambassadors. - Massimo, I speak to you now only as a mother. A mother who lives continually in fear that her son's young life is always in danger, maybe struck down in an ambush. I can't go on this way. Danger was made to make life more interesting! For they who have nothing to lose. But if you were to take yourself a wife. A wife? - There's danger! - War? Much worse: peace! - Peace? The mistress wants him to marry with the della Torre. - The della Torre? I won't marry that girl with a potato nose and a mop for hair! 10 years ago, you too were an ugly little boy full of freckles. But if you could see your Ines now. Easy with the "your"! I haven't said yes. Today she's a beauty, look at her. I hope your doubts have vanished. You know my father… … would have agreed. There was a man. For a woman, he wouldn't be stopped by the Devil himself. Hey, down there! Have you heard? Don Massimo is gonna marry! Massimo is taking Ubaldo della Torre's daughter for a wife! - Some marriage! Massimo is marrying Ubaldo della Torre's daughter! - What? Massimo's marrying the daughter of Ubaldo della Torre! Hey, you? Do you know where…? Double parry and disengage. Block your side! Good! Let's go again! Attack. Be careful now… Careful! You always let me disarm you. - Only you can do it, Papa. But you wouldn't take advantage of your daughter. Fiammetta. Fiammetta! - What is it, Baccio? Have you heard the news? Massimo wants to marry Ines della Torre. Ines della Torre? - Yes. Evil chatterbox! What are you saying? You're a swine! I'll teach you! Take this! - Stop! It's perfectly true. Should I have asked your permission? No, but I consider it a betrayal. Towards whom? Well, towards your ancestors. Let them rest in peace! But Dona Ines? - She's the condition of the armistice. But if you're not in love…? My dear child, when you're older you may understand… Stop treating me like a child! The della Torre only deserve this! Don't get so excited, you might hurt yourself. Don't fear, I can handle myself better than you! - Fiammetta! Let her do it. What shall we bet? This way you'll learn to make fun of me! Did I hurt you? I'm sorry, forgive me. - No, a mere scratch. - No, it's not! Wait! It might be dangerous. Better to draw out the blood like one does with a snake bite. Massimo, let's stop joking. Is it really true? Like I said, Fiammetta, if the della Torre offer peace, we mustn't refuse them. You can forget all the bad they've done? One day, you'll understand no better good exists than peace. That's not true! You're wrong! I'm convinced marriage won't take place. But revenge. The della Torre want revenge and not marriage! Dear Simone, leave to me to decide what is best for the della Torre. But you can't sacrifice your daughter for purely political reasons! You are very dear to me. The ties between our families are old and extremely solid. - Ines! You say something! Of course, you oppose this? Before we go any further, I think it would be opportune to dispense with the ambassadors who have brought their mission to an end. Gentlemen, the della Torre will never forget the contribution you have made to the truce. It was a pleasurable mission. Made easy too by the good will of the opposing party. I thank you, Sir. - Thank you. Don Ubaldo, you can't ask me to give up Ines just on the eve of our betrothal! I hope you can understand the reasons which lead me to this step. A false step! Better to endure the weight of war than the weight of an unhappy marriage. Ines, you won't… you won't give your consent, I hope? Simone, do you know Massimo di Montefalco? I don't, but by hearsay. I hear he's likable, gallant and faithful. I see you haven't been wasting any time. But that's not the truth of Massimo! It's not! And even you'll find out! And when you do realize it, it will be too late. Listen, Simone, I don't like political marriages. But in this case, I'm ready to accept the wishes of my father. And it'll spare the people from more war. How can you talk so? Are you blindfolded? Can't you see it's a trap? Enough! Even so, we have ample time and means to discover the traitor. The marriage isn't tomorrow. All right, Sir. My only wish is that you'll always have need of my sword. And that you'll always have need of my affection. I ask your leave. My child, perhaps I've asked too much. I know that you love Simone. Say no more. There's nothing left to do than to wait for Massimo di Montefalco. Massimo, wait. Wouldn't it be better if you took an armed escort with you? This loyal companion's worth more than a regiment of soldiers. Take this, give this letter to Don Ubaldo. It's a confirmation of our agreement. Look how many people came to see me off. They'll celebrate upon your return when they realize this is a blessing. Look after yourself, Massimo. Do be careful. Don't be dramatic, mother. After all, I'm only going to visit to my betrothed. God protect you, my son. Come on! Are you ready? - Yes. Very ready. - Assist me. Listen, I ain't what one'd call curious but can I know where we're going? We're going to visit Massimo's sister at the Convent of the Claire's. Again? But you were there just last week. Yes, but now I must return. She's preparing to take her vows and wants to see me. Why must you go in such a hurry? - Come on, hurry up and don't argue. - OK. Hey, where are you going? That's not the way! The convent is not that way! I'm not going to the convent but the castle. - The castle? Someone's gotta prevent Massimo from marrying a della Torre. But not by yourself… - Yes, that marriage must be stopped! Oh, woe is me! Hey, why have we stopped here? Don't you see? Massimo's horse. Come, let's go to the other side. Look. His clothes. He can't be far away. Great! Things couldn't have worked out more perfectly! I've just had the most fantastic idea. - Oh, Fiammetta, for heaven's sake, what are you gonna do with that horse? - We'll scare it away and take his clothes. He'll come out, get angry, curse Dona Ines and return home and… Get another suit and horse and return to the castle to marry Dona Ines. Fiammetta! You're right. And if the theft was linked to Dona Ines? How can I do it? Wait! I've got another idea! - Oh, God! Oh, God, we're dead! He needs to think he's the victim of a prank by the della Torre. It's perfect! Bring his clothes and follow me. Yes. - Leave the rest to me. What now? - Now you start throwing stones. But don't hurt him or I'll break your head. Coward! Watch out, you almost hit him! - Stop it! Who is this coward? Now change your voice and shout, "These are confetti from Dona Ines!" These are confetti from Dona Ines! Show yourself! "If you want bigger ones, you'll find the cannonballs at the castle!" If you want bigger ones, you'll find the cannonballs at the castle! Come out of there! Come out! You really think Dona Ines wants to marry a beggar like you? A miserable beggar! - "Like all the Montefalco." Like all the Montefalco! - Like all the della Torre! Tell your mistress, there'll never be born a della Torre worthy to marry a Montefalco! Quite right! Our people don't marry bastards! - Coward! Son of a cat! Cowards! You take advantage because I'm in the water! - Now give me his clothes. We'll destroy them and return to the castle. - Thank goodness. Did you see how furious he was? - Yes, quite furious. But the della Torre, not seeing him arrive, will let him know and it'll be cleared up. Then it was all for nothing? - Right. Wait a second. We need the della Torre to be mad at Massimo. For the love of God, are you starting again? I have a great idea. - Oh, God! Quick! Get his clothes and follow me! Hey! You! Rascal! Coward! Let go of me! Let go! Stop! Stop! Thief! Thief! Help! I've been robbed! Why are you dressed like the Golden Falcon? You're always slow on the draw. Listen here. We must cause some big trouble so that the della Torre think it's Massimo's doing! What for? - You don't get it? - No. The della Torre will be offended with him and the marriage will be canceled! Well done! Now, I get it all. But what must we do? - Follow me. Understand? Post guard here. Don't let him arrive at the castle. Got it? I'll bring you his corpse. No, stupid, I told you that you must take him alive. A dead body won't do. It'd be another accusation against me. And I need him to talk. I don't understand it but I'll do what you say, Sir. But it'd be more prudent to kill him. Carry out your orders and bring me the Count of Montefalco alive. Go! This is a gift from the Count of Montefalco! Halt! Surrender! Take him! Stop, Massimo di Montefalco! The time has come for you to pay for what you've done! Cowards! No! Careful! We must take him alive! Stop him! Tie him up like a salami! This time you won't escape! Hey, you! Put him in this sack! That's it! Take him away! Let's go! They wanted to lure me to a trap! I told you we couldn't trust them! Don Ubaldo is too just a man to stoop to such a vile expedient. Are attacks and insults just? My clothes were stolen! It was probably some hot head. There are lot of fanatics among our people. Fine! It wasn't him. But it shows that this marriage isn't popular! And the only way to put an end to this hate is a marriage with Ines! - What? You still insist after such an insult? - If you weren't my son, I would order you. Keep calm! Keep calm! It couldn't have been the Golden Falcon. If it is as you say, you'll be avenged, don't doubt it! Now go back to your homes and stay there calm and quiet. My soldiers are on the alert and will capture him! Now be patient and you'll be avenged. You get him? - Yes, it was a success. The Golden Falcon is a prisoner. They're bringing him here. - Good. Let's go. It's incredible. I would've never expected such an insult from a Montefalco. This is a provocation plain and simple! - It seems quite impossible. Then what his mother promised… - His mother, but not him! I have great news for you: The Golden Falcon has been captured. You captured him? - Yes, he's in my hands. And I deliver him as a token of my love. - Good! We'll hold him hostage. Come on! Move it! If my men hadn't captured him by now, who knows what else he would've done. Where is he? Is he coming or not? - Right. What are they doing? Come on, get going. - Right away. I'm curious to know the reason for this behavior. - We'll soon find out. Hey, you! Come up! Come on, move it! Here I am! I'm coming. Hurry up with that sack! Well, he tried to escape. I had to hit him. - That's fine. The important thing is that he's in our hands. Let's go! You wait here. Come in, bring him there. Here's the villain to whom you were betrothed to, the traitor who you trusted! Quick, untie him! Come! What are you waiting for? Here he is. That's not him! Who's this? This is Giovanni. Giovanni, how did you get here? It was the Golden Falcon. - The Golden Falcon! The Golden Falcon! Idiots! Don't you see you've been tricked? Get out of here! What are you waiting for? Imbeciles! Get out! Stop, Simone! What is the meaning of this comedy? It's not my fault. There was some mistake. I knew it couldn't be true. The Golden Falcon made a fool of you. Ines, I swear, believe me, it's not my fault. Wait! I hear somebody. - Oh, God! Let's get out of here! - This way! On my honor, you must believe me, this is the pure truth. Don Simone swears true, we captured him but I don't know what happened. You hold your tongue! - Take these squabbles out of my house! Don Ubaldo, Don Ubaldo, listen, believe me! I was tricked. The Golden Falcon can't be far from here. Listen! Please! Careful. This way. They're coming! Good night, father dear. - Good night. The Golden Falcon! Massimo di Montefalco! Help! Help! Help! - Ines! - The Golden Falcon! He's in there! The Falcon… - Ines? - The Golden Falcon! - Guards! I was right all along! Forward! - Careful, Simone! He might still be there! This is like a labyrinth: Round and round and there's no way out! It won't open. - Nor that. Come, this way. He almost hit me! He wanted to kill me! Then I shouted, "Help!" And the coward ran away, threatening and insulting me! I won't forget this provocation, I swear. - Quickly, go and find him. Are you sure about that it was him? - Yes, yes, quite sure. Look here, this is the proof that will remove any doubt. A message from Gertrude di Montefalco! No, don't tear it up! We can use this letter against him. If they want a war, they'll get a war! Guards! Oh, Simone! My hero. My faithful, brave protector. Can you forgive me? No, it's I who should ask your pardon for not saving you earlier. Guards! We've controlled the situation without being seen. Oh, I can't go on. - Stop and rest a moment. Oh, God? What are they doing? Close the gate! He can't have gone far. You go that way and we'll go this way! Let's hide. - Yes. Look now, there's nobody there. Let's go. No, I don't feel it's the right moment to run away. We'll wait for dawn and when all is calm again, we'll get away. Let's go back inside. Baccio! Baccio! It's dawn. Be quick! Now's a good time. - Yes. No, wait! Let's first see what's happening. Halt! Get down! Close the door! - What is it? What do you want? Who gave you this order? Baccio! Look! - What is it? This is tyranny! - You see? Don Massimo. - It's him! He'll meet his doom. Treachery! Forward! Defend yourselves, boys! Hey, come! They're here! - Come! We must do something! Massimo! Massimo! Let go of me! Let go of me! - His standard! Baccio, they have him. Now, they'll kill him. It's my fault. - That doesn't mean he'll die. He'll get out of it all right. Let's think of going. This is the best time, nobody'll notice us. I must stay! I must save him! I want to go to him! The Golden Falcon is finally ours. Now we can really have some fun. Hands off, wretches! I'll kill the whole pack of you! - Free him! Traitorous bastards! Take back what you just said. Give me back my sword, you coward. Stop it, Simone. It was I who was insulted. I've the right before anyone else to question this lord! - Question? Your deeds show your intentions. Massimo di Montefalco, my patience has limits! - Well said. And it's you who has to clarify exactly what your intentions are! Yes! And why did you enter my bed chamber and frighten me in that way? - Me? When I enter a lady's bed chamber, it's not to frighten her. What do you mean? - Ask your mama to explain. Can somebody tell me who this madman is? - Madman? - Simone! My betrothed. Since you've never had any respect for our marriage agreement. Marriage? You can still blather of marriage? What do you hope to gain by this farce? I'm not the one acting, you are! - Don't you dare! Please, Papa! - He makes me lose all patience! Not only did he insult me but he ruined the houses and crops of the peasants! What are you talking about? - The truth! And I can testify to it! A fine testimony! If you want to hang me, you'll have to find a cleverer excuse! It's not an excuse. Behold the undeniable proof! My mother's letter. Then you stole it. Us? - Or one of your assassins! What? You're the thief! No, stop it, Simone! - Your sword, coward! - Let go! Let go! Stop! - Let him go! You hide behind the father! - Take him away! The pleasure is all mine! I want to kill him! - Don't forget you have a bad heart! You're right… my poor heart. No more! Simone, stop! Please! Won't you stop? You won't settle anything with a duel! In the name of heaven, cease! I said, stop it! Stop it, I said! Enough! I'd willingly obey, if in this house, your beauty reigned. But the only answer to treachery and fraud is the sword. I'd like to believe in your sincerity. Just as I wish you were sincere in your proposal of marriage. - Villain! Guards, seize him! What are you waiting for? This is what you deserve! - Cowards! An unjust betrayal! - Tomorrow, we'll hang him! Wait, you can't do such a thing! He's responsible for this! - Take him away! I'm innocent! - Quick! Move it! If you're acting in good faith, look for the true malefactor! You broke the peace of our houses! - Let go of me! Come on. Don't take it so hard, Fiammetta, be brave. Yes, be brave. You say it so easily. Who knows what they'll do to him? Oh, poor Massimo! It's all my fault! I'm the most unfortunate of women. - Most unfortunate? I'd say the most dangerous of women. - Baccio, help me to do something. - What can we do? I've decided to return to the castle and confess all. There's no way but to fix it. - No, no! You'll be the end of Massimo. What a mess I've made! Whatever we do, will only make it worse, Fiammetta. Baccio! - Huh? - Look there. What? - See that wagon? - Of course. That's our salvation. - What, that wagon? No! You don't get it? - No. Oh, I've got a marvelous idea! When I see that expression, I begin to tremble all over. I need a dress. - A dress? To save Massimo? Did you forget we don't have even a scudo? - Did I say we'd pay? Wait! Hey. Hey! You've got a visitor. Huh? You! What do you want? Maybe you came to mock me to crown your deeds? Or have you come to see the wolf in his cage? I came to speak with you. About our engagement? Or would you like to check the bond that binds me so closely to your family? Stop, Massimo. - Or would you prefer me to say, "my lady", "I'm a prisoner of your beauty"? - Stop playing the fool. It's the only satisfaction I've left. Exactly, my father has decided you shall hang. I'm sure this brilliant idea came from dear Simone. Simone hates you. But you don't hate me. - I… I don't want to believe you're guilty. What is this? A new trap? Or perhaps you want to look generous. I can't believe you want to make a fool out of me too. Make a fool of you? Of a magnificent creature like you? But who wouldn't fall in love with you? A pity. I'm starting to regret this hanging thing. You continue to joke about it but everyone believes you're guilty. Everyone? Except you. And that's all I would need to die happily. What is it? I'm not in the most suitable spiritual condition. You won't die. They must listen to me. I'll go to my father. I'll succeed in convincing him. I'll make him change his mind. I… Ines! It's done! Look at me. Who do you want to look like? - Massimo's sister, living in a convent, no? And then? - I needed a school girl dress. Now you've got that poor child involved! - How do I look? I think it'll do. Quick! Out of the way. See, this one will be better. Can I have it as a gift? Let me go! Why do you pick on me? Will you stop whining? - Baccio, keep him quiet. Have mercy on me! I've a wife and children! - You say so? Poor man, I understand. How many children do you have? - Two. Have mercy on me! I have eight. Sorry, is the gag uncomfortable? - No more chatter. Finish dressing. Yes, poor fellow. - Come. Don't insist, my daughter. One day, you'll thank me for having saved you from that individual. Well said! But it doesn't seem fair that a young man is punished for a crime he didn't do! "He didn't do"? That's the limit! Fires, damage, and attacking the peasants. What else is needed to hang him? Maybe that's not enough! - Is it necessary to shout? I've spoken to him. I saw his frank and honest face. I'm convinced he's innocent. If that's what you want, marry him! But you'll soon be a widow! Indeed? You seem very sure of yourself. It's no use arguing, my decision is final. - No. Excuse me, Ma'am, there's a young lady who insists on seeing you. Why are you sweating? Fear? I'd like to see you with the Golden Falcon's cloak wrapped around your body. Does it show? - No, don't worry. You remember it all? Yes, I've got to find the room of that young fella, what's his name? Simone. And you must find a way to let me know when you're ready. Go in. Wait for me here. - Yes, I'm going to sit right here. I'm Elena di Montefalco, the sister of Massimo. A Montefalco! With what courage do you show yourself in our house? The habit I wear should make you see I follow the gospel of love thy enemy. But in any case, I have no enemies. The Gospel is a great book but for men of arms like us, not the most apt. Men of arms who must not be ignorant of the laws of chivalry. You are a lady and no one will offend you. I warn you that if you've come to plead for Massimo, you're wasting your time. Excuse my insistence but I must obey the precepts of charity. I know nothing of the things of your world. - Ah, my girl, this severe world of ours, has hard laws. Unfortunately. Yes, there's no use in explaining a just decision. I understand your feelings. But who are you? - The betrothed of Ines. And I won't allow you to meddle in our private affairs. Please Simone! You mustn't forget you're speaking to a lady. And moreover a religious one. I'm sorry, I provoked your anger. But now that you've told me you're engaged to Ines, that explains it all. What do you mean? If Ines should marry Massimo, she'd have to stop thinking of you, right? Otherwise, it'd be a mortal sin. - Yes, of course. And then Don Simone would have only one solution to assure Ines' return. What are you insinuating? Nothing, God forbid. Except that Massimo's misfortune has been your good fortune. Massimo deserves to be hanged. I've heard that people, often in order to attain their ends, hatch dark schemes. What are you driving at? - Let her speak, I beg you. We've solid proof against your brother. And who is to say that this proof is not the fruit of a plot meant to harm him? An base accusation! I won't tolerate it! - But no, for heaven's sake, I only said there could be a plot and that the plot's author must be someone who'd gain from Massimo's downfall. Is it my fault that you meet all of the requirements? But this woman's mad! Throw her out! Simone, please! Don't exaggerate. Heaven knows how much I want you to be proven innocent. My conscience is clean. You believe me, Ines? - Really? So much the better. Then in your place, I'd get to the bottom of this. She's right. There mustn't be even a shadow of a doubt. Fine, I'm ready for anything. Even to let them search your room? - Search my room? Why? You haven't answered her question. - Well, it's absurd! Simone, yes or no? I hoped that at least you would accept me on my word. But as you wish, Sir. Let's go then. Aren't you coming?- No, the things of this world don't concern me. Later, you'll ask my pardon. We were really good! Everything is going great! What are you doing? Remember your a novice. You don't embrace your servants. I'm delirious! We've fixed everything! - Well, thank goodness. Let's hope so. Why? It's all cleared up now, isn't it? Massimo is free and Simone will go to prison. - Right, all cleared up. Massimo is free and can marry Ines. And we can return to our house, eh? - Oh, dear lord! You're right. Massimo's free to marry Ines. Then it's all been for nothing. - Of course. Baccio! I must stop Simone immediately. But no… Saving him means hanging Massimo. That would drive me crazy! I've got a wonderful idea! - Oh, God, we're dead. Listen, here's what I'll do. - Shame! How can I believe in your word of honor? He's looking for an excuse, wretched impostor! - Impossible… I refuse to defend myself from this infamy! It's an offense I reject with disdain! I know nothing about it and if you don't believe me…! Stay where you are! This role of a hero doesn't suit you. You're only a swindler! - A swindler…! But can't you see that I'm the victim of a great swindle? Lower that gun. I could never raise my hand against the father of the lady I love. Be careful, father! He's tried to send an innocent man to his death. He's capable of anything! - Don't fear. He wanted to take the place of Massimo, wish granted. Guards! Guard! Put this man in prison! - I never want to see you again. - Ines… One minute, listen to me! - Don't move or I'll shoot! Guard! Guard! - I can't believe such baseness! We'll see about that. Guards! Finally! When I need you, you're never here. Arrest this man! One moment. Put him in prison and liberate Massimo di Montefalco. Go! - Justice! I'm innocent! I'm innocent! Thank you, Elena, I hope this embrace will express my gratitude. You would've done the same to save your brother. Yes, and return him to his lady love. Ines. - What is it? Are you really certain of your love for Massimo? Of course, why should I doubt it? - I beg you to believe me. Massimo is a strange person. I don't know if a sister ought to speak so. But you see as a woman, there are certain things I mustn't hide. What do you want to tell me? Sit down. Please speak freely. You don't know how painful this is for me. But it's better to tell you the truth about Massimo. Down here. - I'm not, I'm not the culprit! Let me explain! Don't you understand I'm innocent? It's all a plot! I'm innocent! Let go of me! Finally, justice is being done. - Injustice is being done! The truth will out. - Coward! I'll present your regards to Dona Ines. But this isn't the end! Ines will never be yours! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! I want to kill you! Kill you…! - The chains, hurry! Look, you see this mark? A scar. Massimo did it to me. I don't see anything. Maybe it's further down. It happened a long time ago. It happened when we were children. Even then, he showed his true instincts. And yet he has such a sweet expression. Yes, yes, that's what everyone says. But the heart of a demon. My mother tried having him blessed. It was useless. He's a madman. - I can't believe it. A woman's affection…? What I'm trying to ask, when he's in love, how does he behave? That's just exactly what I want to put you on your guard about. As soon as he's aware that a woman is in love with him, oh, heaven help him, he becomes a tyrant makes her a slave and beats her. Beats her? Yes, it's happened many times before, unfortunately. Massimo can only be mastered with a lady who's indifferent, mean. A woman who'll make him behave. - How strange. Yet he created quite a different impression. Once he's achieved his object, I'm sure you know what I mean, my brother reveals his real personality. He's just a third-rate Don Juan! Dona Ines, the Count de Montefalco has been set free. He'll be here shortly with your father. I'm done for! Help me, protect me! If he sees me, he'll kill me. He hates me. It was he who put me in a convent. For heaven's sake, hide me. Come on, don't be afraid. You're with us now. No, I beg you. A hiding place for tonight and I'll be gone tomorrow morning. But he mustn't know, please, that I've ever came here. Please, be calm. Massimo won't know anything about it. Leave it to me. I hope you've understood and are willing to accept our excuses but who would've ever suspected Simone of such a thing? Me neither. I thought he was an ass. He's a serpent! But fortunately an honest dove is more clever than he. Then you didn't unmask him? - No, just a minute. There's a surprise for you. Come. Huh, no one here. Listen Don Ubaldo, ever since I've arrived at your castle, I've had many surprises. I've had enough. Don't worry, you see there's a lady involved the surprise is always pleasant. Ah, Ines! I was just telling him of his sister… Oh yes, Simone's sister. - Him again? What does he have to do with it? How pale you are. The emotion of the day has tired him. Excuse Papa, he's need to rest. - But I'm fine! No, Papa, you're not well at all. See you tomorrow. Let's go, Papa. What's going on? - We mustn't mention Massimo's sister. Will you explain? - There are all sorts of complications, I'll explain later. Is it possible that I always have to learn about things later? Always later! Why all this secrecy? Well, I did it on purpose, so I could be alone with you. Dear Ines. - Because of us, you've had this terrible experience. I do hope you can forgive me. It was done the moment I learned of your real sentiments for me. Just a moment, Massimo. I'm sure you must be hungry, I'll order your dinner. Ines! Wait, Ines. After being only a step from death, almost losing the hope of seeing you, of holding you, you speak of eating? You're forgetting that shortly we'll be man and wife. - No. But at this moment, it's the duty a good wife to provide for her husband's needs. I'm very anxious to know you better. I've heard so little about you. - I've nothing to hide. You called me, Ma'am? - Prepare a meal for the Count and take it to his room. And in the meanwhile… - In the meanwhile, let's talk about us. Perfect. Perfect. Thank goodness! This sleeping draught will do. You remember what you have to do? I hope I remember but my head is so confused. - You'll do fine. I don't know what I would've done without you. - Let's go over it once more. First dinner -- Massimo, the sleeping draught -- the maid, then we say hello to the dungeons. - Have you no faith in me? No. - Get moving. Time is precious. Let's hope that she's not ugly and her breath doesn't stink. Baccio! The sleeping draught. - Oh, yes. And your sister, do you love her? My sister? I haven't seen her in a while. I believe she's taking her vows. Why? Why do you shut her up in a convent? - Our characters are too different. We never got along. - Yours is a fine pretense! Who doesn't agree with you, is removed! - Don't be so dramatic, Ines. We're speaking of my sister. You should meet her. You'd be convinced she's a difficult girl with odd ideas. But she's still a lady. What you say gives me the impression that with women, you love to act the tyrant. - Maybe, that's true but not always. For those I like, I treat with kid gloves. Have no fears. "Have no fears?" Why? I'm not the least bit frightened of you. Ines! Now listen, Count of Montefalco, let's be frank. You're a handsome man, likable, you have a certain personality, but all this does not authorize you to think I'm madly in love with you! I wouldn't ask so much. For the moment, I just need you to love me a little. The man I marry will have to give proof, primarily of his respect. And after an absolute, complete dedication. You've changed. I've a feeling somebody's been talking badly about me. Or maybe you're still interested in Simone? I'm mistress of my own mind. Fine, Ines. I see today's emotions haven't just tested the nerves of your father. But yours too. I confess I expected another reception. What reception? I'm a cold, mean woman. I keep men at arm's length. The more I listen to you, the less I understand. You'll understand later but I need proofs of your love. Then tell me. Want me to fight 5 guards? Go around the world? Die of hunger? The Count's supper has been served in his room. There's no need to be so worried. Dying of hunger is not the proof, I require at the moment. You know how to tell kisses from cheese? I really wouldn't know. Cheese is good with the macaroni but a kiss is perfect here! Did that clear it up? I wouldn't want you to get cheese on your shoulder and kisses in the macaroni! No, not now. Let me get the tray ready. Who is this fine stuff for? - Count Massimo di Montefalco. His taste requires lots of seasoning. Here you are. Browned just right. What a fine polenta! It's as appetizing as you! Stop, you'll make me late. - Massimo can wait. - So can you. Give me time to bring the supper to Count Massimo. Be quick, I'll be waiting for you here. Anything else? - No, thank you. Now that we're alone, let's only think about ourselves. Sit down, Isadora. Let's drink to our love. - But I never drink. That's wrong! Don't you know that wine…? Really? - Yes. Go on, have a drop. It's good, right? It makes my head spin. That's what we want, my dear! Just one more. Just one more. Go on. Massimo? Massimo? Heart of mine, why make me do all this? It'd be so nice if you loved me. Massimo, why do you sleep? Right! It's all your fault! Here she is. - Good, you're here. Oh, Baccio, you're great. - How heavy she is. There. Pay attention. Now we must make this look like an orgy. Lower. Lower. - You think about Massimo! Hurry! Come, take his arm and put it around her head. That's the way. - In the arms of Morpheus! Lucky him! No, maybe it's better this way, with her head more back. Oh, my darling, how I wish I was in your arms. That pillow needs fixing. Now it's perfect. Now blow out the candles and let's get out of here. Oh, Papa! You see him? Wretch! - Darling… Villain! Even this affront! - Cad! Now I know him! Wake up! Who are you? - Where am I? Get up, impostor! - Under my roof with a servant! And don't stay there dazed like an idiot! You understand me? Your behavior's unpardonable! You return our hospitality with by mixing with servants? I never seen her before! - Because it was too dark! I give you my word as a gentleman! - A fine word! Get out, hussy! Leave my house right away! Your sister was right! - You spoke to my sister? When? Yes, she came to warn us. But you won't see her! She's under my protection, I forbid you to harm her! But you're all insane. When did I ever hurt my sister? Stop playacting, we know all about you! What do you know? - Don't touch me! Don't vent on me your bestial fury! Bring to me my sister. I want to know… - Don't even think of laying a hand on her! Me? - Yes, you monster! I can't believe the same blood runs in both your veins. It worked to perfection. We succeeded! What a scene! There's no time to lose. We'd better beat it. Massimo! Massimo! - They're coming. - Who? - All of them. All? - And Massimo too. Stop! Massimo… - Let go of me! Come here! Now we'll clear this up. I want to see who the one you think is my sister! Guards! Guards! - Where is she? Help. Help! Help! Massimo, what do you want? Let go of me! Let go of me! Why do you hit me so? Massimo… - Massimo, stop it! - I beg you! Help! Help! Open up! - Open up immediately! - Open up! Massimo! Sorry, but it's necessary. - Well then… - Get moving. Hurry. Massimo! Massimo! I beg you, don't hit me anymore! Sorry. Keep stamping. Massimo! - For the last time, open up! Massimo… Come here and hurry! Force this door open. Force it! Harder! Quick! Oh, Massimo, my brother, what did he do to you? - What happened? He hit him on the head to save me. You saved us from a man who is cruel and false. How can I thank you? Just forget me! Forget me! - You mustn't leave like this. - Yes. Yes, it's better this way. - No, Elena, I beg you. My sacrifice has not been in vain. Anyway, your marriage was impossible, absurd. Goodbye! Low prices here! What are you doing there? Beat it. Come, ladies! Look how beautiful! Good deals for you! Look! One moment. It's her! Thief! Thief! Stop her! Stop her! Thief! Stop, wretch! - Hurry, before they recognize us! Let's go, Baccio! Cowards, where are you going? Get them! Stop them! I want an explanation now! Cowards! This is a trap and you'll pay for it! Cease your madness! Leave! - Yes, I'm going! But first I want to know something! - Woe to you, if you hurt your sister! This nonsense about my sister again? If she's exists, she'll explain! Stop! - Massimo! - Guards! It wasn't me! - I don't want to see you ever again. Go away! No, my dear, this time you'll pay for all. - Coward! Scoundrel! I'll teach you a lesson you'll remember forever. Go away! - Come here! - I never want to see you again! This is for the stones in the river! This is for the welcome you prepared me! This is for the vase on my head! And this is for all the other trouble you got me into! I said I don't want to see you! Get out! You're coming with me to the castle! - I won't go to that monkey! Not even if you kill me! - You'll come! - No! I'll show you! - Put me down, I said! - Come! Come on, stop sniveling. And use this handkerchief. I'm not sniveling. I don't feel well. - Why? You have to ask me? Come, let's go. What's wrong? What's the matter with you? - Can't you see I'm sick? Oh, nonsense! You act like you're dying. What a pest! What the devil is wrong with you? Open up! Open up! It was all my fault. It's all my fault. Are you satisfied now? Is the interrogation over? Oh, thank heaven, we finally have learned the truth! It was impossible a gentleman like Montefalco could do such a thing. As for you, we won't hesitate to forgive. It's clear you've acted out of love. Ah, love! That tender, sweet sentiment that upsets the hearts who seek… - Who? - Eh? Me? Me in love with that coxcomb? Ah, no. No, you're mistaken. I don't care two figs about him! Go and marry the lady you think you love! And if you want to be together, go on! I wish you much happiness. May you burst with it! Well, now there are no more obstacles to your love, we can announce the engagement. We must think to prepare a marriage, a very solemn and unforgettable ceremony! What's the matter? You don't seem to be in a good humor. Excuse me, I'm a bit tired. Ines, I'd like your permission to leave. - What? Right now? I've many things to prepare. Of course, I understand perfectly. You may go. Thank you. Excuse me. Ines, I don't want to be wrong, but I think there's something amiss. He's only human, Papa. After so much turmoil, Massimo needs to be alone. Fiammetta! Fiammetta, what are you doing? For the love of God! Leave me. Life is meaningless to me. Everything's finished. - Don't be foolish. At 18, life is just beginning. - I said leave me! Without Massimo, I might as well be dead. - Don't be silly. When you're dead, it's over. You won't win Massimo. No, the idea that I'm dead because of him will take his peace and give him remorse. That's nice: If he repents and wants to return to you, he can't do so. Forget it, Baccio. Now, it's useless. The marriage will take place. Listen to me: For once, I have an idea. We'll get the same effects of death without its disadvantages. What must I do? They accused me of impersonating the Golden Falcon. Now their accusations will be true! - But when they notice the abduction? Leave it to me, don't worry. - She's here! - She's coming! - To your posts! Massimo? Why are you here? What are you doing in my room? I'm abducting you, dear. It's more romantic. Don't hurt her! Quickly! Tie her up well! Bring her outside! Be careful! Baccio! - Master! Where's Fiammetta? Answer me. Where's Fiammetta? Go on, talk! Did something happen? She loved you too well. She couldn't fight it anymore. What are you saying? - Her suffering is at least at an end. She's dead? - Yes. You killed her! She loved you so much. What a tragedy! Bring me to her. It was him! Him! Massimo di Montefalco! I recognized the Golden Falcon cape. - I must be going out of my mind. Why would he kidnap her if they were going to be married? He kidnapped her, my Lord! Stole her away! Poor Miss Ines! Enough! I get it! Stop whining. - My lord! - What is it? Well, I've bad news. - More? - Count Simone has fled. Well done! Fine guards! In the whole dungeon, there's only one prisoner and they let him get away! He used trickery. It could've happened to anybody. - One moment. Then he's the one who stole my daughter. Simone! That wretch wouldn't give her up! You need to find that rascal! Get out! Don't just stand there wasting time, looking like an idiot! Sir? - What is it now? Gertrude di Montefalco is here. - The mother of Massimo! Damnation! That's all I needed! What will I tell her? Calm down. Calm down. Let's not lose our heads. Everybody be absolutely silent. I'll go. No need to be so dramatic. Massimo's mother is here. You'll see I'll fix everything. Ah! Nice to see you, Dona Gertrude! I'm overjoyed to see you looking so well. I've had a terrible journey but I'm very anxious to have word of this betrothal. Ah, yes, yes, everything's fine! Yes, all is going very well. There's only a bit of confusion. The preparations, you understand. I can see the confusion. But where are the children? Ah, yes, the children! They were just with me. They just went out a moment ago. They went to take a stroll. The darlings spend the whole day together. I'm very pleased but want to see them. Please send for them. No, no, wait. First, I'd like to have a few words with you. Sit down, Dona Gertrude. Now then. Do you know how well you look? Fiammetta… Why did you leave me? Why didn't you learn to wait? Let me kiss them. These poor, cold hands. But they're still warm. The poor thing has just died. It takes nine hours for the soul to leave the body entirely. Nine hours. I was blind, I didn't realize you loved me! And now I shout uselessly in my despair to a frozen likeness in death. Oh, why? Why was I so foolish? Why can't I return the life which you sacrificed for me? Your sweet face will never smile again. She looked like she smiled. - No, you're seeing things. Or maybe her spirit still flitting about. You can't see it but it flits, it flits. Fiammetta, if you can hear me, forgive me. I'll never forget you. May your sleep be light but without pain. Baccio, doesn't it look like she moved? - No. Either I'm going out of my mind or cruel fate has come full circle. Sometimes the gods are moved by the tears of tender lovers. And do you think I'm worthy of so great a miracle? No, I don't deserve it. I must punish myself, pay for my crime. But surely, you won't do anything silly? Don't think about killing yourself. Kill myself? No, my punishment will be to live. And to humiliate myself, I will subject myself to marrying a lady I don't love. Ines? - Yes. Ines! Adieu, Fiammetta. Now what shall we do? Bravo! You had a fine idea. Now I've lost him forever. Massimo! Massimo! Fiammetta! - Help! Help! Behold, a miracle has been performed! Yes, the warmth of your affection has brought me to life again. - A miracle! The miracle is that I've been saved from your trap! Massimo! Massimo, forgive me. I did it out of love. No more pity. You've tricked me once but no more! - Listen! Don't go away, I beg you. I'm really going back to Ines. There's an honest and true woman. Come, have courage. Baccio, I've lost Massimo. I've lost his love. Nothing matters anymore. Now I really want to die. Fiammetta… Why didn't you tell me at once? - Forgive me, Dona Gertrude, I was afraid it would lead to further misunderstanding. Well, sooner or later, I would've realized your daughter was gone, no? For heaven's sake, don't be angry. You'll see, we'll find them soon. You must know that Simone is in love with her. He won't do her any harm. It's precisely that I'm worried about. Mother dear! When did you arrive? Never mind embracing me and think about your fiance. They've kidnapped her. - Ines kidnapped? When, who? Simone, last night. - I should've expected it. - Why? They take away your betrothed, they steal her away under your nose, and you stand there calmly and do nothing! How modern day youth disappoints! And what should I do? Run all over Tuscany to find her? Ines can be in one place only: in Simone's country place! If I were a few years younger, I'd show what I could do! You're quite right, I'll go find her. What do you hope to achieve with your action? I won't give in to bullying. You've miscalculated. I'll never consent to marry you. But Ines, my love, I couldn't make you understand how much I love you. Ines, have you forgotten all your promises? All my anxiety for you, all our dreams? Believe me, it was the only way I had to show you that I love you. A fine way to prove your affection! You dress up as the Golden Falcon and bring me to a barn. I brought you here 'cause nobody could find you here, not even Massimo. That's the reason: You're afraid of Massimo! Afraid of Massimo! I wish that villain would come around here, I'd show you what I'd do to your fine Massimo! Ines! Simone, listen to me! Open up, Simone! I want to talk with you! En garde! - Simone, have you gone crazy? - En garde! Defend yourself! Defend yourself! Simone! Come, defend yourself! Traitor, defend yourself! This time, you'll pay dearly! - Simone, let me speak. I won't argue with you! You tried to steal my Ines' affections! I can't steal what's mine! - Ines has always been mine and always will be! Not true! I've been promised to him! - Ines! If that's what you want, then you'll both die with one strike! Simone, don't be mad. It's useless. You must die according to the laws of chivalry! As you wish, I can't hold back. - Coward! I'll kill you! Simone, let's stop! - Show yourself a man! Be careful, Massimo! Scoundrel! Stop it! Stop it! - Coward! Simone, I said "stop it!" Stop it! Enough, Simone, you're mad! - Let go of me! - Listen, Simone! All right, now I'll show you! Cease, I said! Massimo! Simone! No more! Now, finally, you'll listen to me! I don't want listen to anything. You've won. If I must live without Ines, I prefer to die. Listen Simone, if you'd let me speak, I would've explained. - No! A gentleman who has lost an honorable combat must pay. Ines is yours. Simone, what I wanted to say was Ines is yours. - No, never. I could never accept. You've got to accept, she's yours. Massimo, you're the most generous of gentleman. But, I really can't accept. - Simone, be good. Do it for me. Hey! Gentlemen! Am I to be bartered so? Do I not count? Simone's deep love for you has moved me profoundly. What are you saying? - The truth. We were making a fine mess of things. It would've been well, if I loved you Ines, but I love another. - Thank you, Massimo. Frankness is not one of your weak points. If we marry, we'll make three people unhappy: Simone who loves you, I who am in love with another and the other who loves me. A fine egotist! It took you all this time to find this out? This is the first opportunity I've had. But I've known for a long time, dear Massimo. Yet, I wanted to use you, to give Simone a way to demonstrate his love. Ines! - I saw how fiercely you fought. You even disguised yourself to kidnap me, at the risk of your life. Darling. Damn! How stirred up, they are. They seem mad. If they don't arrive soon, a revolution will break out. Perfectly true. My men are waiting for a pretext to take up arms. And mine? They need nothing more to go wild. Meanwhile, let's begin the celebrations. This way their spirits will be placated. Oh, I thought we could find another remedy. What would you say if instead of their marriage, we announce another? In times past, I would've listened to your words, but what could we poor old people do now? Oh, Gertrude, I'm the one who's old. In your case, time seems to have stood still in not touching your beauty. Ubaldo! It's the truth. - Ah! Flatterer! Suffer, Fiammetta and expiate. Push away all that is tied to the joys of the world. My girl, are you quite sure of the sincerity of your vocation? I must live a life of hard penitence. But you're mad! - No. She's right. - Massimo! Go away. Don't disturb with your profane appearance, my will and intentions. Have no fear. I only came to ask you to submit yourself to a hard penitence. No penitence would be severe enough. Shut your eyes. Oh, Massimo. You really mean it? Oh, my love! Matrimony is a sacrament equal to penitence. Frequently more severe than penitence. Wait! Wait! One moment! Surely, you won't leave me here? Hey! You see him? - Yes. Hey! Merchant! Merciful heavens! Revised English subs by sineintegral@KG
