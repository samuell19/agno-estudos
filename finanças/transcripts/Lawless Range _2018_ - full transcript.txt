Reed likes you, and that'll mean something after I'm not around, don't mess that up by bringing him into it. Into Tommy's shit. - I never said anything about Tommy. I don't know what he done this time but it ain't your business Sean. And it sure as hell ain't Mr. Reed's. Yeah. - You can't carry him Sean. - He's family Boss. - You think that means shit to him?

You can come out, you can stay the weekend. - Sure, sure. All right Gonzo. - Hold on one second. There's no serial. If you need the money, we'll get the money. - It's nothing-- - No Sarge, you need money we'll get money. - You come out to the house. - Sure. Hey take it easy Sarge. - What's that? - It's nothing. - Did you ever think about leaving? - I did leave. - Yeah, that's right. Hey what was it like? Over there? - It sucked.

That's gonna be a problem now isn't it? - I have two hundred right now. Just a courtesy, get us started. Tommy's gonna drive over three hundred every other week 'til it's paid in full. - How about this. How about I take that two hundred, and the fifty-eight hundred you owe me, and I will consider letting you walk the fuck out that door. - You don't talk to my brother like that. - Tom. We're gonna get you your money. - I got no doubt about that hero. - You don't talk to my fucking brother like that Eddie. - Tommy. Should I just kill you now, get it over with? - Listen. - What'd you say? - Talk to me, not to him.

Why? - Let's just talk about it in the morning. Come to bed baby. Good morning. Where's mom? - Protesting. Where's Tommy? - He's the original asshole Claudia. - No argument here. - Can we please talk about this when his only daughter's not in the other room. - How much trouble is he in Sean? - Well, it ain't good. It ain't as bad as all that, but it ain't good. Is he gonna be okay? - Help you hun? - Yes m'am, my name's Sean Donnelly. I work for Mr. Reed down at the ranch. I was hoping to have a word. - Mr. Reed's not in yet. - I'll wait. - You ever play? - I'm sorry. - On the computer? - No m'am. - Don't start. - Whitney Madine, get off that damn Solitaire. - Sean Donnelly's here to see you. - Who? - He works at the ranch. - Hello sir. - Oh of course, Sean. How are ya? - All right. - Everything okay at the ranch? Did Boss send ya? - No everything's fine. - All right. Well come on back. - Thank you sir. - What can I do for you Sean? - Sir I was talking to Boss. - Uh-huh. - And uh, this ain't easy for me to ask. I'm in a bad way. I could use a hand. - Well I see that. But specifically Sean, what is it I can do for you? - A loan. - Uh-huh, and Boss sent you? - No sir, I didn't mean to, nah. He said it would be better if I didn't ask. - Well son, Boss about had the right of it. - I know sir, I understand, and I hate asking, I can't even tell ya. But like I said, I'm in a bad way. - How much? - Six thousand. - Son, how much you make working for me? - Enough. - Boy, not nearly enough. - Mr. Reed, I will pay you back. - I'm sorry son. - Mr. Reed, if I could just, if I could just get some time. - I'm sorry son. I really am. - Mr. Reed, I would never do this if I didn't feel like it was important. - Sean, there just ain't nothing I can do for ya. You hear me son? I mean God bless ya boy, but I'm running a business here. - I understand. Thank you for your time. - Hey. You gonna be okay? - I'll be all right. - Sean, God don't never give a man more than he can handle. You'll see. You're gonna be just fine. - Yeah. - Yeah. - John. You seen Tommy? - Sean. My office. - You seen him? - My office. Where you been? - Boss, I-- - I ain't your boss Sean. Boss means you been working, and you ain't been doing none of that. I had to hire a couple of Mexicans out of a parking lot. You know how many times I've had to convince Reed that hiring overpaid Irish boys was good for business? - Boss, I'm sorry, I just couldn't let Tommy. - Shit I know. I knew it when you came asking for that money. Mr. Reed called. Was you always this dumb? - You want me to clear out my stuff? - You quitting? - You tell me. - Give them Mexicans a ride outta here after work, and I can't be paying for no missed days. - Hey Boss, where's Tommy? - Fuck I know. - Well he's here. - The fuck he is. - God damnit. - Howdy. - Get in the house. - Claudia, where's the baby? - He's napping. - You want me to call the sheriff? - No ma, just get in the house please. Ma, shut the door. - I'm just here to talk some sense. - You don't talk to my family. - I was just sitting-- - You don't. You don't talk to my family, you understand me? - I hear ya. But, Eddie ain't gonna stop wanting his money. - You'll get your money. - Need it quicker than that. - I don't, I don't know what to tell you. We don't just have six grand lying around the house. - Then I'm gonna kill him. You're brother, and there ain't no other way. - You know I can't let that happen. - This doesn't need to be your problem, just think about your family. You think about the smart play here, you just tell me where he is. - I don't know where he is. He could be locked up for all I know. - Nah, he ain't locked up. We'd know if he was, and that'd make it easy. You tell me where he is, and we walk away. If I leave here without Tommy, that's on you. You hear me? Think about this. Think about what I'm gonna have to do if you don't tell me. Where's Tommy? - Get the fuck off my lawn bud. - Thanks for the lemonade. - Exactly what kinda jackpot we into here son? - It's kind of a long story. - You expecting trouble? Not really. - Care to elaborate on that? - Sorry to ask you to do this. I have no one else to call, I'll be right back. - What? Is Tommy here? - No. - Sean. Where's Tommy? - I don't know man. - Fuck you John. - Well Sean. What the fuck? - Get up. - Hey. - Get up. - Sean. What the fuck man? - Get out. Get out. - Where you going? What are you doing? Hey, what. Where were you? Where have you been? Why weren't you at work? - Sean! Sean. - Where have you been? They came to my house Tom. They came to my house, my fucking family. I'm done Tommy. - Sean. - No, I'm done. I'm sorry. - Hey. Hey. - Hey Tommy, what the fuck was that all about man? - I need your car. What? - Please John, I need your fucking car. - All right. - Your gun? Your piece, is it in there? - Yeah. Everything okay? - Just gotta fix something. I just filled it up. Bring it back that way. - Where were you? I asked you a question Sean. Okay. - Tommy? - Don't fucking move. The cash, give me the cash, let's go. - Son look, let's think about this man. Drop it! Drop it! Turn around! Turn around. - I was just coming to get myself a Slurpee, it's fucking hot out here. I'm gonna have to call you back. - Shit. - Hey, you hear that? Someone out there? Hey, who's out there? - You said to bring the money. Shit, you scared the fuck outta me. Here we are. - Yeah. - So how's Margaret? Emily? - She good. - That's good. You remember when daddy left? - Not really. - Shit, you weren't much older than Emily is now. I remember this priest came by the house to visit. This was before mom stopped going to church. He just took me out to the property line. We just sat out there by the fence like a couple a queers. After a while he says, "Leaving couldn't have been easy on your daddy Tommy. "He'll be thinking about you boys all the time." Shit, I just sat there thinking what a bunch of crap that sounded like to me. And I told him it seems just about the easiest thing in the world is to pick up and leave. In fact, I still can't think of anything easier. Then we sat there for a while, and he says, he says to me, "Tommy, good people do bad things, "but that don't make 'em any less good." Do you think that's true? Hey. You think that's true? - I don't know. - I hope it is.
