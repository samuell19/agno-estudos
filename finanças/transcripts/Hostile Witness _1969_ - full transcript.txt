You find her not guilty on the indictment, and that is the verdict of you all. Yes. My Lord, I ask that she be discharged. Julia Kelly.

Another call for triumph. Good afternoon, Smithson. My dear John, it's an accepted fact amongst the criminal classes that jurors like his face. I've heard it time and again. Have you, indeed? Oh, Joanna! Hello, darling. How are you, darling? Fine. Was that woman a friend of yours? Are you joking? But she said-- Never mind what she said. I want you to meet someone. I don't think you've met my daughter, Joanna. Mr. Smithson.How do you do? And Mr. Naylor. Hello. How do you do? Well, do I detect the sweet smell of success? It's just that the jury preferred my face to Mr. Naylor's. No accounting for taste. None. Well, I thought she was guilty. I know she was. But she was brilliantly defended. Goodbye to you both. He is rather pompous, isn't he? Don't let him fool you. Well, anyway, your face is nicer. Thank you, darling. Are you coming now? No, the judge wants to see me in his room. Oh. Good evening, Miss. Oh, Charles, I shall be going back to chambers. Very good, sir, good night. Good night.Good night, Miss. Good night, Mr. Crawford, good night, Joanna. Oh, Miss Larkin, would you do something for me? Will you take Joanna in that disgusting little car of yours to pick up some flowers I've ordered? She knows where the place is, and she can walk home from there. Since you put it so nicely, yes, of course, come on, Joanna. Thank you. And charge the petrol to petty cash. The judge is waiting, Mr. Crawford. Oh, yes. Hello, boy! Coming in for a drink? No, I've got to go into the Gregory's. It's Phyllis' birthday. You seen Joanna? No, I haven't. Well, if you do, tell her to come right in, will you? Right. [woman] Keep smiling. Keep blowing! Oh, Simon, you are a fool. That's not all. You mean there's more? A florid tribute of fantastic proportions has been created for you by Christine Bly, no less, and Joanna's on her way with it now. Oh, bless you both. I'd have brought it myself, only my presence was requested backstage by Osborne, J. He is cross with me again. You shouldn't deliberately provoke him. Oh, but that's the point, I don't. Well, Ozzy, he could have been so brilliant, if he hadn't let his brains go to his head. Yes, where's Matthew? I have no idea. He was supposed to meet me at The Savoy at 5:00. When it got to half past, I decided to come home and put on the chicken. Wise decision.

Most of the older men have retired. Well, keep after it, will you? It's most important. Yes, sir. [Hamish] I take it you can support your claim that you were never in the Gregory's house that night. Within the time limits of the medical evidence, yes. But only within those limits? That's the only time that matters, surely. What are the limits? Well, the pathologist says he died between 1:00 and 2:00 A.M. And where were you at that time? I was lying unconscious on a settee in Hugh Maitland's house. [knocking] Come in. Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

Oh, thank you. How long have you been a member of Mr. Crawford's chambers? Four years. Long enough to know some of the answers. Very few, it seems. Why do you say that? I don't think Mr. Crawford has a very high opinion of me. And what's your opinion of Mr. Crawford? Now, it's in his interest that I should know, so please be frank. Well, as an advocate, I don't think there's anyone at the bar to touch him. I agree. And as a lawyer? I think he tends to be too impulsive. To be at his best, he needs a good solicitor behind him. I agree again. And as a man? You really want me to be frank? Please. I think he's intolerant and a bully. He has an immense conceit, and because of it, he's supremely self-sufficient. I think he's ambitious. And as far as his ambition's concerned, quite ruthless. Ruthless enough to commit murder? Surely, you're not suggesting-- Miss Larkin, the police aren't fools. They aren't going to charge a man of his standing without being sure of their ground. So, do you believe him or don't you? Whether I believe him or not is beside the point, surely. If, when I know the facts, I find I can believe him, well and good. If not, we simply defy the crown to prove their case, or plead diminished responsibility. Now, look here. Miss Larkin, what is he frightened of? Why this constant euphemism that since Joanna died, he became ill? What he had was a complete mental breakdown. Why not admit it? I'm sorry, twas later than I thought. This is Major Maitland. My solicitor, Mr. Gillespie. Oh, how do you do? Of course, you know Miss Larkin. Yes, indeed.Who I hope will be appearing for me at the trial. I-- I would--Yes, she will. Good, now don't argue. Just do as you're told, and try not to let me down. You, sit down. Thank you so much. Well, Miss Larkin, this is your show. Please, Mr. Crawford-- Miss Larkin, Major Maitland is waiting. Very well. Major Maitland. You realize, do you not, the extreme seriousness of Mr. Crawford's position? Oh, yes, of course. And your own responsibility? My responsibility? Yes, well, you see, his only answer at the moment is an alibi based on the fact that at the time of the judge's death, he was with you. Oh, yes, well that, of course is perfectly true, he was. Between what times? No, no, no, no. No, he spent the night in my house, you see. He'd been attacked, and I found him, and brought him in. But at what time? Oh, half past 12, quarter to 1? You're quite sure about that? Oh, yes, quite sure. Why did you make a special note of the time? Well, I-- I didn't. Then, how can you be so sure what time it was? Well, it must have been about then, you see. Why? Why? Yes, why? [laughing] Oh, I see what you mean. Well, I had given a small dinner party that evening. I cleared up after my guests. I have no resident staff, just a daily woman who-- who comes in. And then I took my dog out for a walk, and I found Simon lying there. I really don't know why you're adopting this tone with me, madam. After all, I'm merely trying to help. Major Maitland, I'm adopting this tone with you because it is precisely this tone that will be adopted by the other side, when they come to test the strength of an alibi which is supported by only one man, who happens also to be a close friend. [Maitland] Oh, yes, yes, I beg your pardon. I do quite see that, of course, yes. [laughing] How frightfully clever of you. So, will you please try to remember? Did you actually look at the time when you brought him into your house? [sighing] Please, Major Maitland. Yes, yes, yes. Crawford remarked on the time later, yes. When? What? When? Oh, when. [laughing] When he recovered and went to go home, he made some remark, like, "Good Lord, is it 1:30 already?" You know, something like that. Time I was going. And did you look at the time then? Oh, yes, I think I must have done. Quite sure about that? Well, I mean it's human nature, isn't it, When anybody makes a remark like that. I mean, it's automatic to look. A little reflex action, isn't it? [laughing] Yes. Major Maitland, reflex action or not, are you able to swear that you looked at the clock, and you saw the hands pointing to half past 1:00? Please, Major Maitland, yes or no? Yes, I did. You are quite sure about that? Well, uh, isn't that what you want me to say? Major Maitland, I don't want you to say anything that is not the absolute truth. Yes, well, that is the truth. Yes, I-- I remember now. He was anxious about recalling the time, and I was able to reassure him. [sighing] Thank you, Major Maitland. Mr. Gillespie will be getting in touch with you. Yes, of course. Well, naturally, I shall do anything I can. Shall I see you later, Simon? Just keep Charles company. I'll join you in a moment. Yes, by all means, of course. Well, good night to you. Good night, Major Maitland. Good night, sir. Goodbye, sir. Yes, well, I hope you think I'll be able to help. [door closing] I'm sorry, but I'm hanged if I think so. Don't you believe him? It doesn't really matter what we believe, Simon, does it? Only in so far as if you don't believe him, you don't believe me. He's telling the truth, Hamish. Quite possibly. But let's face it, Simon. In any other circumstances, you wouldn't trust that man as a potential key witness any further than you could kick him. If I were convinced to his truthfulness, I would trust him. And risk a let down? Simon, admit it. On this afternoon's showing, any competent junior could break that man in the box like an egg. What do you suppose a man like Naylor would do with him in cross examination? Even Naylor can't cross examine his own witness. What the devil do you mean? Maitland will be our witness. No, he won't. Maitland's already made a statement to the police. I haven't, nor am I going to. So, the crown are bound to call him as the only person who saw me in the Mews that night, and must treat him as a witness of truth and be bound by what he says. They can't cross examine. Any cross examination will be ours, not Naylor's. But Naylor still has the last word. In reexamination only. Yes, and reexamination can be just as deadly as cross, if you put your mind to it. You know that as well as I do. Mr. Crawford, we can not rely on that alibi as the main line of defense. We daren't chance it. We've got to rely on it, it's all we have. [knocking] Come in. Excuse me, sir. [Simon] Yes, Charles? Superintendent Eley is here now, sir. Ah. Thank you, Charles. Tell him I'm just coming. Very good, sir. [sighing] Miss Larkin, there may be a few things I shall want from home. If there is anything I need, perhaps you and Charles shall bring them along sometime? Yes, of course. Thank you. [sighing] Now, no arguments, Hamish. The alibi goes in. [overlapping chatter] [gavel striking] Be upstanding in court! All persons who have anything to do before my Lords, the Queen's Justices, of oyer and terminer, and general jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, draw near and give your attendance.

Not guilty. [crowd murmuring] Mr. Crawford's chambers. Who? No, Charles is at court with the governor at the moment. Yeah. Mr. who? Mr. Ball. Yeah? One of the shorthand blokes? Yeah? No recollection of any threats against Mr. Crawford or Judge Gregory? Right, I'll tell him. Yeah, pass the word on, will ya? Right, ta ta. [Naylor] Superintendent, on that same Monday evening, did you remove anything else from Mr. Crawford's house? Yes, sir, the letter. Exhibit Six. It was in the locked drawer of his writing desk. Will you look at that letter, please? Is that the letter? Yes, sir. Describe it for the court, and then read it. It is dated the 16th of April, and is typed in red, not very well. There is no address. The letter reads, "Dear Mr. Crawford, "thank you for the money, very welcomed. "The man responsible for your daughter's death "was Sir Matthew Gregory. "If you don't believe me, "put it to him and see what he says. Yours truly, James Armitage." The signature is written, sir. Thank you, Superintendent. Superintendent? Who is James Armitage? I understand he's a private investigator, Madam. Although he is not registered as such. No. Nor does his name appear at all in the telephone directory. No. Nor since he lodged such detailed information with you concerning Mr. Crawford, have you set eyes on him from that day to this. No. Hardly reliable informant, would you say? On the face of it, perhaps. And yet his information is accepted without question. That's not so, Madam. It's the duty of the police to check up on all information. On checking his, it proved to be right, so we acted on it. But you never questioned him again, did you? I didn't have the opportunity. So, how can you be sure he wasn't lying? How can you be sure the whole thing wasn't specially laid on to throw the blame onto Crawford, when in fact, the real culprit was Armitage, or someone connected with him? My Lord, my friend knows better than that. If she has a suggestion to make, let her make it, and not ask questions which is no part of the superintendent's duty to answer. My Lord, I suggest that if my learned friend were to call Armitage here for me to cross examine, there would be no need for such questions to be asked. My Lord, I have given this matter considerable thought. With what result, headache? My Lord, not more than usual, when appearing before your Lordship. No, my Lord, I must object. Your Lordship is well aware-- Let's just get on with the case. Miss Larkin. If your Lordship pleases. Superintendent. I don't want there to be any misunderstanding about this. The scientific evidence brought by the crown against my client, consists of traces of his blood and hair found on the firedog in the judge's study. His fingerprints on the murder weapon, and on a liqueur glass of a vin du valais, also found in the study. Wool fibers and threads from his overcoat under the dead man's fingernails, and corresponding traces of the dead man's blood on that overcoat. Am I right? Yes, Madam. Then would you please look at the firedog with the blood and hair on it? Exhibit Three. It takes apart, does it not, one bit screws into another? Yes, Madam. Then, take it apart, please. Now, will you take in your hand the bit showing the blood and hair? It forms a conveniently portable offensive weapon, does it not? Yes, it does. Just show it to the jury. Thank you. Put it down. [forcefully putting down firedog] Now, suppose, just suppose, that someone with that weapon was waiting in the shadows that night for Crawford to come home, and hit him on the head with it as he was about to open his front door. Possible so far? Yes, Madam. And suppose this someone then dragged or carried him into the judge's house, where the judge was already lying dead. Or alternatively, took the necessary objects out into the Mews, pressed Crawford's hand round the weapon with which the old man had been killed, and also around the glass of a vin du valais, as alleged he drank. Still possible? Possible, yes, Madam, and not very likely. Bear with me a moment longer, Superintendent. That's all I ask. And suppose this someone then scraped the dead man's hands down the overcoat that Crawford was carrying, so that wool fibers and threads were lodged beneath the torn nails, and so that smears of blood were left on that overcoat for all to see. Would not the scientific evidence available under such circumstances be identical with the scientific evidence now being produced by the crown to say that Crawford killed the judge? Yes, it would. Thank you. And now, let me take supposition a step further. You are aware, are you not, that Mr. Crawford's keys were stolen that night, which was his reason for spending the night at Major Maitland's house. Major Maitland made a statement to that effect, yes, Madam. Is there anything to have prevented whoever stole those keys-- If they were actually stolen. Is there anything to have prevented whoever stole those keys that night from entering his house in his absence and planting the letter signed James Armitage in his drawer? I suppose not. So, we are left with this, are we not? That the scientific evidence brought by the crown in support of the supposition that Crawford killed the judge, supports equally the supposition that he was killed by someone else, who saw to it that Crawford would be blamed. With respect, Madam, you're forgetting the evidence of his own clerk, that such a letter was delivered to his chamber two days earlier, and that Armitage himself went to see him by appointment in hospital some time earlier. I am forgetting nothing, Superintendent. Now, will you please answer my question? Is there anything in the evidence I specifically put to you, that rules out the possibility that Crawford was framed? No, Madam. Thank you. [crowd murmuring] Conversely, Superintendent, is there anything in any of the evidence that rules out the probability that he was not? No, sir. Thank you, Superintendent. Dr. Wimborne, now, please. This way, sir, please. [crowd murmuring] Silence! Put the book in your right hand. Now, read from the card. "I swear by almighty God "that the evidence which I shall give "shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." Doctor, on the 19th of April last, did you perform a postmortem examination upon the body of a man identified to you as Matthew Gregory? Yes, I did. What did you find? There was a single entry stab wound, angled downwards, one inch above the left nipple. Exploration of this wound revealed that the heart had been penetrated in two places. Two places? The passage of the wound divided into two, just below the level of the wrist. Indicating what, that the deceased had been stabbed twice? Possibly. Are you able to establish the time of death? Yes, I first examined the body in the study at 7:30 A.M. I estimated that he'd been dead about six hours, taking us back approximately to 1:30 A.M. allowing half an hour each way for fluctuation in temperature. This establishes the death within the time bracket of 1:00 A.M. and 2:00 A.M. I am much obliged. At the prisoner's own request, doctor, did you later visit him at Brixton Prison, and examine a partially healed injury to the back of his head? Yes, I did. How much force would have been required to inflict such an injury? Quite considerable. Huh. Will you now please look at the firedogs, Exhibit Three. Stand it up on the table, please, as if they were in a grate. That's right. Can you see them quite clearly, doctor? Yes. [Naylor] Now, in your expert opinion, would the injury of the prisoner's head be consistent with his having fallen and hit the back of his head on that bust at the top? Was it the sort of injury that you might expect from such a fall? Yes, it was. Thank you, doctor. Doctor. Was there anything in the nature of the injury at the back of Crawford's head to show that it must have been caused by his falling onto the firedog, instead of, as I suggested, being coshed with part of it? Nothing, no. Thank you. Then we need waste no further time over that. Have you a ruler with you, by any chance? No, I haven't. Oh, Mr. Gillespie? Miss Larkin, if I may? Oh, thank you. Would you give your doctor the murder weapon, Exhibit One? Yes. Doctor, now that you have the knife in front of you, would you measure it across the blade at its widest point? Exactly one inch. In the course of your postmortem, did you measure the width of the entry wound you described? Yes, that also was exactly one inch. So, my friend's suggestion that Gregory was stabbed twice with that knife makes nonsense, doesn't it? It would call for an amazing degree of accuracy, yes. So, for all practical purposes, we can rule out the second stab actually as a stab? I agree. But, suppose later, it became necessary for some reason after the first stab, to remove that knife altogether, and then to replace it, to look as though it had never been removed. Do you follow me? Yes, of course. Could it not have happened under such circumstances that whoever replaced the knife failed to realize they were deviating from the original path of the wound, below rib level? Yes, that could have happened. Thank you, that is all. But, did it? Did it what? Happen? I have no idea. Precisely. Thank you, doctor. My Lord, may I refer you to page 21 of the deposition, the evidence of Major Maitland? Page what? 21, my Lord. Yes, Mr. Naylor. My Lord, Major Maitland is a close friend of the prisoner. He's attended court under his recognizance, but I'm now instructed that he refuses to give evidence for the crown. Are you applying to treat him as a hostile witness, then? That was my intention, my Lord. However, as the evidence has been adequately covered by other witnesses, subject to anything your Lordship may say, I no longer propose to call him at all. Miss Larkin? My Lord, I respectfully agree. No! Simon! All right, let me try. My Lord, have I your permission to confer shortly with my client? Certainly, Miss Larkin. Much obliged, my Lord. Why the hell can't you do as you're told? Call him. But can't you see, he's done enough trouble as it is with his antics. Naylor's already spiked our guns by making him hostile. That doesn't alter his evidence. But, Mr. Crawford, that man's evidence isn't-- I still order you to call him. And I refuse. I must do what I think is right. And to call him now would be utterly wrong. If you insist on calling him, I shall be forced to withdraw from the case. Very well, then. I'm sorry. Yes, Miss Larkin? My Lord, it seems I'm no longer able to act in the best interest of my client, so instructions have been withdrawn from me. In the circumstances, I can only apologize, and ask leave of the court to withdraw from the case. [crowd murmuring] [door slamming] Now perhaps, Mr. Crawford, you'd be good enough to tell me what you propose to do now? My Lord, I ask permission of the court to defend myself, and to retain Mr. Gillespie to advise me. Very well. Oh, uh, Miss-- Miss-- Miss-- oh God. Major Maitland, sir. What? Yes, yes, rather coming, coming. [crowd murmuring] You all right? [man] This way, sir, please. This way, sir, please. Silence! Take the book in your right hand, read from the card. I refuse to take the oath. I refuse to give evidence against an innocent man. [crowd gasping] Major Maitland, am I right in assuming that you're only desire is to help your friend? Yes, sir-- my Lord. Then, be advised by me that you are not doing so by adopting this attitude. If you do not take the oath, he can not question you. And if he can not question you, you're powerless to help him. I-- I beg your pardon, my Lord. I-- I didn't understand. Very well, then, do as you're told. Yes, of course, my Lord. Thank you so much, that's awfully good-- Take the book in your right hand. Right hand, sir, please. Oh, uh, yes. Read from the card. "I swear by almighty God, "that the evidence I shall give "shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth." Yes, Mr. Naylor? My Lord. Major Maitland, is your full name Hugh Beresford Maitland, are you of independent means, and do you live at Number 22, Gordon Mews, Southwest One? Yes. No further questions. Major Maitland? Do you recall the night of April the 18th last? Yes, most certainly. I say, are you, um? Yes. Oh, I see, okay. Would you be good enough to describe to his Lordship, and to the jury, the events of that night as they affected yourself? Yes, of course. Well, um, I-- I gave a small dinner party that evening. I invited you, and you were unable to come. Was Mr. Justice Gregory a guest at that party? Yes, he was. [footsteps approaching] [Simon] And then, did I remain with you in your house? [Maitland] Yes. You found you had lost your keys, so I made up a bed for you in my spare room. [Simon] And what time would that have been? [Maitland] Well, by the time I left you for the night, it had been well after 2:00, well after. Let me have a look at that pocket diary of yours. [Simon] Well after 2:00. Major Maitland, we've been told that the time bracket within which Mr. Justice Gregory was killed was between 1:00 and 2:00 A.M., outside limits. Now, at any time within that bracket, was I not in your house, not in your company? Nope, no, you were with me all the time. Oh, you couldn't possibly have killed him. I told them so. Thank you, Major. [Naylor] Just a moment, Major Maitland. You are quite sure of these times? Yes. With no possibility of error? Nope. Presumably, you recall consulting your watch, or a clock. Yes. Yes. Do you carry a pocket diary? [laughing] Yes. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to turn to the page for Sunday, April the 19th. Certainly. Yes. Read to us what it says at the top. It says Sunday, April 19th. Go on, please. It says 7:30 A.M., "Very grave news." What else is printed there? Oh, printed there, sorry. Uh, at 2:00 A.M., British Summer Time begins. Do you understand what that means? Yes. It means, does it not, that before going to bed on the Saturday night, everybody in the British Isles is supposed to put their clocks forward one hour, doesn't it? Yes. Did you put your clocks forward one hour that night? Did you? No. Thank you. When did you put them forward, when? I-- I didn't, I'm terribly sorry. I must have forgotten. I suppose my daily woman, Mrs., uh-- Mr. Crawford, it is not the usual practice to re-cross examine. I beg your pardon, my Lord. Thank you, Major Maitland. That's all. My Lord, in view of what has been said, I ask leave to recall Dr. Wimborne. Very well, Mr. Naylor. Dr. Wimborne, please. [crowd murmuring] My dear fellow, I'm most awfully-- Oh, you blithering idiot. [Naylor] Doctor, you are already on oath. [Wimborne] Yes, sir. Now, you've told us that you first examined the body at 7:30 A.M. Yes. Did you take the time from your own watch? Yes. And had you put your watch forward one hour to comply with the commencement of British Summer Time? Yes. Yes. Now, you've also told us that the body had been dead for some six hours. Yes. Establishing the time of death as between 1:00 and 2:00 A.M., British Summer Time. Yes. But, suppose, like Major Maitland, you did not put your watch forward one hour. What then, would you have given as the outside limits of death? Between midnight and 1:00 A.M. And by Maitland's time, Crawford was not found by him until 12:45. Thank you, doctor. [crowd murmuring] [sighing] Well, what can we do? I'll have one last shot at getting him to change his plea. Do you think he did it? Under stress of the Armitage letter? Well, don't you, now? No, no he didn't kill him, I know he didn't. How can you know? Does he even know himself? He's been a very sick man, remember. Don't look at me like that. Do you think this is any easier for me? Oh, why can't he trust people? Why won't he let us help him? Because he's Simon Crawford. Is that any reason? Oh, Mr. Gillespie, you know how long I've been in his chambers. Four years! Any idea what it's been like, to have instructions just fed into you all the time, like a computer? Always do what he wants, the way he wants it. Is that any way to learn your job? And made to feel that if you do something right, it's because he told you how to do it, and if you flub, it's because you were fool enough to disobey his orders. Well, he's not foolproof, and he can't work miracles. Can't he be made to see that? And now, because of his bloody self-sufficiency, he's-- [Simon] Hamish, just clear out, will you? [Hamish] What? There's something I want to say to Miss Larkin. Very well. Won't you sit down? May I have one of these? Yes, of course. They're French, do you mind? No, not a bit. [exhaling] Miss Larkin, you were angry when I came in, about me. Yes. Cause I'm about to be convicted of murder, and you, perhaps, could have prevented it? Or because you felt unwanted the past four years? One can hear everything out there. I-- I shouldn't have said that, it was childish of me. I only said it because-- Because I'm about to be sentenced to life imprisonment through mishandling my own case? Oh, it wasn't only you-- It wasn't only that, it was, everything. I mean, the evidence being rigged and not being able to prove it, and Major Maitland letting you down, and-- and you telling the truth, and no one believing you. It's all so biased. That's still no excuse for an emotional outburst. Counsel is paid to advise, and to think, and to act. And you can't do any of these things if you fill your head up with a lot of sentimental nonsense. Good God, Mr. Crawford, I know that. Well, if you know it, why don't you act on it? Otherwise, you'll have suffered four years of frustration for nothing. If that doesn't mean anything to you, it does to me, because I resent the waste of time. I'm sorry. Well, I'm sorry, too. Having got to that point, let's see what we can do to put things right. Now, first, where you went for me just now, of it being emotional, doesn't mean I don't appreciate your concern for me. I'm most grateful. Mr. Crawford-- And secondly, concerning the four years you spent in my chambers, I can understand your resentment, and the fault was mine. A young counselor with a natural ability are few and far between. And nine times out of ten, if a young counsel is given his head, he loses it. And what could have been a shining talent, becomes instead a conceited mediocrity. I didn't want that to happen to you. I didn't know. I took damn good care you shouldn't. Perhaps that's where I went wrong. I should have told you sooner. So, I'll tell you now. Yours is a shining talent. See that you keep it so. Now, I think you better go to the mess bar and get yourself a drink. And send Hamish in. [closing purse] And Sheila. This time I do need help. Oh, come in, Hamish. Sheila seems a bit tensed up. What have you been saying to her? Nothing that shouldn't have been said a long time ago. Here, help yourself to a delicious glass of water. Hm? I'm breaking a lifelong rule. Well, I made a proper mess of things, didn't I? Yes, you did. So now, perhaps, you'll listen to reason. My dear man, I'll listen to anything. Do you still not think there's something in what I suggested? You mean to run diminished responsibility? Yes. I think it's a monstrous suggestion. I did not kill that man. I swear to you, that is the truth. But can you be sure? Yes. Of course I'm sure. Yet, you hesitated. Why? I wasn't sure I understood your implication. But you did understand it, didn't you? You had been mentally ill. I'd had a bit of a breakdown, we've been through all that. But not deeply enough-- Will you stop it? No, I won't. I've got to say this, and you're damn well going to listen to me. You know as well as I do, the tricks the mind can play. Suppose you had been taken ill again. But I wasn't, I was discharged and cured, completely cured. All right, so you were. But illness can return. Suppose something happened that brought it back again. But what, there was nothing, absolutely nothing. Except, perhaps, something your subconscious mind won't allow you to remember. Such as? That you really did see Armitage. That is not true. But it is possible. No. Simon, listen to me, for God's sake. Admit to yourself, you could have killed him. If you were advising someone else, someone in your predicament, with the facts we know before you, and the same alternative to face, either life imprisonment for a convicted murderer or a possible two years for a sick man in need of help, what would be your advice? I won't let you do this to me. I have to. Answer me, man, and be honest. What would you say? I'd say the same as you. Then, will you do it? I don't know. [knocking] Yes, what is it? Clerk from Mr. Crawford's chambers to see you, sir. Oh, show him in officer, will you, please? Charlie? In here. Yes, Percy, what is it? Sorry, sir, a message came through the office for Charles, sir-- Mr. Milburn, sir. Something about threats against Mr. Crawford, sir. Well? Well, I took it, sir, because Mr. Milburn is down at Winchester this afternoon, and I thought you ought to have it as soon as possible. Well, what was the message, and who sent it? One of the old shorthand blokes, sir. Name of, uh, Kennen, or Gennen, or something like that. He said have we thought of Logan, sir? John Logan, who made a bit of a song and dance about you and the judge in court, after he was sentenced in 1943. He can't remember the details too much, but he's pretty certain of the name and the date. During the war, it was, because all the lights in court went out, and that's what made him remember. What court was it? His, sir, at the bailing. Officer? Yes, sir? Will you do something for me? Yes, sir. Get your chief to ring Miss Larkin, she's in the mess bar. And get her to borrow the transcript of the trial of John Logan, from a 1943 court records, and get them down here to me immediately. It'll be Mr. Gillespie's undertaking to return them. John Logan, 1943? Yes, and please hurry. Right you are, sir. John? [whispering] Anything else, Percy? Well, sir, um... Well, nothing, sir, except, um, Mr. Painter and the girls asked me to wish you all the best, and good luck, sir. And that goes for me too, sir. Well, thank you, Percy. Thank you, sir. And now, you'd better get back and keep them in order, hadn't you? Yes, sir. Good night, sir.Good night, Percy. Logan. Logan. I came as quickly as I could, you wanted these. Transcripts on Logan? And the original depositions, yes. Thank you.What's happened? Another tip off. Percy came along with it. Hamish, I was right, it was Gregory. After sentence, Percy said, didn't he? Mr. Justice Gregory. "John Logan, you've been found "guilty of robbery with violence "of a most brutal character, "as a result of which three men "were seriously injured, indeed, "one may well be crippled for life. "It is quite clear to me that you are a ruthless "and dangerous criminal from whom the public has "every right to be protected. "And protected it shall be. "The sentence of this court upon you "is that you be in prison for life. At this point, Logan-- " Ahh. "At this point, Logan turned "to the prosecuting counsel, Mr. Crawford, "then back to the Mr. Justice Gregory, and said, "I shall kill you if it takes the rest of my life. I'll kill you, both of you." We're in business. Possibly, possibly. But let's take it step by step. How much can you recall of this man now? Can you picture him at all? After 25 years? Hamish, you know as well as I do, that no counselor can picture the face of the man in the dark not five minutes after trial is over. No, I suppose not. There's one thing I do remember, though. He was color blind. Why that, for heaven's sake? Because that's what led to his arrest. His driver had been injured in the raid, and Logan had to drive the getaway car himself. Now, the Germans had been over the night before, and the escape route was in shambles, and the salvage people were operating a single lane of traffic with a red and green light. And Logan, being color blind, drove straight through the red, and was stopped by the police. Just a routine stop. But they looked in the back of the car, saw the injured driver, and that was that. But this man was sentenced in 1943. You mean, it's inconceivable a man could harbor revenge for so long? I don't see why. If you're insane enough to make the threat in the first place, and mean it. How do we know he meant it? We don't, but assume he did. Is 20 years in prison going to change him? Isn't he more likely to nurse the idea? To plan it, replan it, turn it over and over in his mind, till at last he comes out still with this terrible obsession. The two men responsible for putting him away must be destroyed. That's insane. Is it? So, the man's mentally ill. Is that so unusual? Not five minutes ago, you had no hesitation suggesting I was. [knocking] Yes, officer, what is it? Telephone, sir, from your office. They insist it's very urgent. Oh, all right, thank you. I think you're letting your imagination run away with you. ♪♪ What is it? These were in the back of the folder. What are they? Pictures of Logan taken after his arrest. It can't be. Add 20 years, look at the eyes. The eyes don't change. Where have you seen those eyes? ♪♪ [crowd murmuring] Yes, Mr. Naylor? My Lord, your Lordship will recall that I was unable to conclude my case yesterday, owing to the indisposition of Lady Gregory. Lady Gregory, I'm happy to say, has now recovered, and is with us. Lady Gregory, please. Lady Gregory, please. [crowd murmuring] [man] This way please, madam. Charles. Where the hell are they? I don't know, sir. Well, find them, will you? I'll try, sir. Silence! Take the book in your right hand. Read from the card. "I swear by almighty God, "that the evidence which I shall give "shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." Thank you. [Naylor] Lady Gregory, is your full name Phyllis Charmaine Gregory, and are you the widow of the late Matthew Gregory? Yes. I shall be as brief as possible. Thank you. How well do you know the prisoner? Intimately, my-- my husband and I were closely associated with him for a great many years. How so? He first entered my husband's chambers as a pupil in 1937. In 1941, when he was on leave from the Navy, his wife was killed in an air raid, and he himself was terribly injured. Joanna, his daughter, was only two at the time, and he turned to us for help. We took her in with us and looked after her. Later, when he at last got out of the hospital, Matthew-- my husband was able to get him settled in the house next door to us in Gordon Mews, which was then empty. And then? Well, he took up his career again, and did very well. And all this time, until your husband's death, you were neighbors of his in Gordon Mews. Yes. Thank you. Your husband drove a car, did he not? Yes. Was he a good driver? Please answer my question, Lady Gregory. Was he? No, he was not. Did Crawford ever express his views to you about your husband's driving? Yes, he-- he always hated being driven anywhere by my husband. Why? Because he-- he didn't consider him safe. He didn't consider him safe. Because of his intimate family relationship with you, did Crawford confide in you? Certainly. And he was with you on the night of his daughter's death. Yes, he was-- he was terribly upset. What do you mean by that? I mean, he was more upset-- he was almost out of his mind. Go on, please. He-- he told my husband and me that if ever he found the man responsible, he-- he'd kill him. Thank you. Oh, one small point. Who in your household drank vin du valais? Only Mr. Crawford. Why did you keep it then? Especially for him. It was more of a joke, really. He loved it, but no one else would-- touch it. Thank you. Lady Gregory, you and I know each other very well. Yes. Are you then suggesting that I could believe for one moment that your husband could have knocked Joanna down in the street and driven off without stopping? You don't really think that, do you? No. Thank you. [Naylor] Thank you, Lady Gregory. My Lord, that is the case for the crown. [crowd murmuring] Mr. Crawford, what I'm about to tell you, you know as well as I do. And nevertheless, it's my duty to say it. You are not obliged to say anything in reply to the charge against you. But, if you wish to do so, there are two courses open to you. Either you can give evidence on your own behalf, on oath in the witness box, in which case you can be cross examined by prosecuting counsel. Or you can make a statement to the court from the dock, in which case you can not be cross examined. In either case, it is open to you to call witnesses. Now, will you please tell me what you wish to do? I will give evidence on oath, my Lord. Very well. Officer. May I first have a brief word with my solicitor? Yes, yes. I'm much obliged. [crowd murmuring] We're barking up the wrong tree. Oh, how? Logan is dead. Dead? He's been dead for years. Oh my God. You've got no choice now, Simon. Will you take the oath, sir, please? "I swear by almighty God "that the evidence I shall give "shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." My Lord. Members of the jury. The case against me is based upon three things. Scientific evidence, a theory of motive, and proofs as a breakdown of my alibi, proof that I had opportunity. I concede now, I had opportunity. But I concede nothing else. I did not kill Mr. Justice Gregory. I had no reason to. Never for one moment, did I believe him responsible for my daughter's death, and I still don't believe it. But, because the man Armitage alleges it is so, the police believe it, and accuse me of believing it also. Now, the police have shown you fingerprints, blood and hair, my overcoat even, which I may remind you they found hanging in my hall, not concealed in any way. I don't know how this evidence against me came into being. But one thing I do know. Someone had reason to kill the judge, and to see that I would be blamed for it. Somewhere, there is a man, or a woman, who has lied and distorted the truth, so that I should stand before you today accused of a crime I did not commit. Only when this monstrous web of lies and deceit has been blown away, only then can justice be served. That's all I have to say, my Lord. The only web of lies and deceit in this business, is of your own making, isn't it? No. Then, let us examine the situation a little more closely. You loved your daughter very dearly. Yes. So much so, that after her death, you determined to kill the man responsible for it? Certainly not. Nevertheless, you told Lady Gregory and her husband that if ever you found this man, you'd kill him. That was said in grief and anger, not half an hour after my daughter died. Are you suggesting then, that a threat to kill is any less of a threat because it happened in anger? In these circumstances, yes. These circumstances being that it now suits your purpose to minimize that threat. Not at all. I see. Why did you employ private detectives to find this man, when the police were doing everything possible? The police were getting nowhere. You don't seem to have much of an opinion of the police, do you? I have the greatest regard for them. Really? When you didn't trust them to find the man who ran down your daughter, any more than you trusted them to find the man who coshed you on the head that night and stole your keys. That question never arose. But that's precisely the point I'm making, Mr. Crawford, it should have done, shouldn't it? The police got a full report the following day. But not that night. No. No. Nor would they have had one the following day, unless you had been forced to invent some cock and bull story on the spur of the moment to explain away the injury to your head. That is not true! No doubt, the jury can hear what you say. But, let me return to the question of your daughter's death. Why did you see fit to employ private investigators to find this man? So that you could help the police? Or so that you could punish him yourself? In fact, you formed an intent to punish him yourself, did you not? Oh, some such thought had occurred to me, but I never formed an intent. I suggest that you employed private detectives to find this man, so that you could kill him. I did not. Nor did anyone I ever engaged succeed in finding him. Oh, come now, one did, didn't he? Armitage, the man who sent you this letter. I never saw that letter. The envelope delivered to chambers contained blank paper. Armitage found him for you. No. And having found him, you killed him. No. As I've seemed to have said a thousand times, the information given to the police by the man Armitage was false. I never engaged him as a private detective. I never received a letter from him. I don't even know who he is! How, if his information was false, does it come about that everything found later by the police confirms it as being true? Because he knew in advance what they would find. The trap was set and sprung, and I was inside it. The truth is you knew the contents of that letter to be a hideous fact, and there was murder in your heart. No. You were never attacked that night. Instead, you called on the judge, you knew he was alone in the house. He confessed what you already knew, that he was your daughter's killer, and you killed him. That is not true! ♪♪ Mr. Crawford, do you wish to add anything to your previous statement? No, my Lord. Then, return to the dock. ♪♪ My Lord, may I again ask the court's indulgence to confer with Mr. Gillespie? Very well, but don't be too long about it. I'm much obliged, my Lord. Now, look here, you say Logan is dead. When did he die, and how? He was killed in a train blowup in 1944. But, he was in prison then. They were transferring him from Maidstone to Dartmoor. The train was shot up by a German night fighter. He and his escort, and two other prisoners were in the last coach which caught fire. They all died. Was his death reported? Not in the papers. I suppose because it was wartime. We can cover the lot. He must have fooled them somehow and got away. It's the only possible explanation. Even if you're right, how can we prove it? What about fingerprints? Did you go down to records? Yes, I did. All Logan's records have been destroyed. Destroyed? It's normal procedure ten years after a criminal's death. Oh, damnation. Have you got that copy? Yes, I have. Let me have it, and the stuff we got last night. But, you can't follow the plan now. I'd have to bluff it out somehow. Did you go down to the war office? Yes, I did. There are no records. Well, that'll do for a start. Thank you. [judge] Are you quite ready, Mr. Crawford? Or would you rather I adjourn the court? I'm quite ready, my Lord. Are you proposing to call witnesses on your own behalf? My Lord, no. However, since the court rose last night, certain information has come into my hands, as a result of which I now ask the court's permission to recall certain crown witnesses. My Lord, I must object. The case of the defense is closed. I'm well aware of that, Mr. Naylor. However, in the rather unusual circumstances, I'm prepared to extend every facility to the defense. I'm much obliged, my Lord. [judge] Which of the crown witnesses do you wish to recall? First, my clerk, Mr. Milburn. Very well. [Simon] Mr. Milburn. Yes? I want you to help me, if you can, about this man Armitage. Yes, sir. Now, yesterday the court heard evidence from the hospital system that Armitage had visited me twice in the hospital during my illness. Uh, twice in fact in January, although I never saw him either time. Yes, sir. You also said in reply to Mr. Naylor that you had seen Armitage on one of these occasions. Yes, sir. I was just leaving after visiting you. He asked me the way to the private wing. What was the exact date, again? January the 18th. January the 18th. And what was the time? About 3:00 in the afternoon, sir. 3:00 P.M., thank you. Now, you also said that on Friday, April the 17th, you put a personal recorded delivery letter, the envelope of which was typed in red, on my desk, and which was signed for by Miss Larkin. Yes, sir. Would you agree now, with my suggestion, that both the visitor Armitage, and the letter, were nothing more than links in a chain of false evidence, deliberately manufactured to frame me? I would, sir, yes. Thank you. How long have you known me, Mr. Milburn? Nearly 15 years, sir, since 1952. And before that, what were you? I was Junior Clerk in Mr. Robson's chamber, sir, for six years. And before that? In the army, sir, I joined Mr. Robson soon after I was demobbed. And you served throughout the war, did you not, from 1939? Yes, sir. In the Royal Corps of Signals, I believe you said. Yes, sir. Rising to the rank of Sergeant Major. Sir. Sir. Mr. Milburn, how well would you say we know each other in 15 years? I would say very well indeed, sir. And I've always confided in you. Of course. Well, do you ever remember my mentioning the name Armitage to you before that day in January? No, sir, never. Then, would you agree now with my suggestion that Armitage, as a man, never really existed? That he was simply a character assumed by someone for the sole purpose of destroying me? [Milburn] I think that must be true, sir. And you actually saw him? At the hospital, yes, sir. Well, can't you possibly help me? Are you quite unable to identify him? I wish-- I wish I could help you, sir. It was the hair and the clothes and the thick glasses. It could have been anyone, sir. A close friend of mine, even. Someone you know quite well by sight. Well, yes, sir. Perhaps even someone in this courtroom now. Well? Well, yes. If it was a disguise, and me not expecting it, it could be. As I said, sir, it could have been anyone. Thank you, Mr. Milburn. My Lord, may I now recall Major Maitland? If you insist. Thank you, Charles. Yes, sir. Major Maitland, you're still on oath. Yes I am, yes, sir. Would you refer once again to your pocket diary, and turn to the page for January the 18th. January the 18th, most certainly, yes. You are an assiduous diary keep, are you not? It is your practice to make an entry of some sort each day. Uh, yes it is, yes. Would you be kind enough to read to us what you had to say for the afternoon of January the 18th? The afternoon, most certainly, yes. Here we are, here. [clearing throat] "Lunched at club, "sole overcooked, complained to steward." Ah, here we are, P.M., P.M., here. Uh, "Bought a pair of gloves and went to-- " Went to what, Major? Hm? "Went to the Garden of Eden." [crowd laughing] The Garden of Eden? The Garden of Eden Club, my Lord. It provides a nonstop review in Dean Street, my Lord, specializing in female chorus work and artistic tableau in the nude. Thank you, Mr. Crawford. I'm not quite so old that past memories have faded beyond recall. I merely wish to clarify the exact location of the Garden of Eden referred to. As your Lordship pleases. Dean Street, you said? [Maitland] Yes, my Lord. Thank you. [crowd laughing] Major Maitland, what time did you go to the Garden of Eden, and what time did you leave? Well, I, uh, I suppose I got there about 2:30. And, uh, I left about 6:00. You sat through the show twice? Well, not intentionally, no. I remember now, of course, I went there. I'm afraid I fell asleep. How old are you, Major Maitland? 58, my Lord. You have my sympathy. [crowd laughing] Were you accompanied on this visit? No, no I wasn't, no. So, there's no one who can actually prove that you remained there from 2:30 until 6:00? Um, no, there isn't. But, why should anybody doubt my word? Why, indeed. On the other hand, isn't it possible that you did not remain there, or even go to the Garden of Eden at all? I mean, I-- I was there. I-- I don't understand. Isn't it equally possible that instead, you made a show of visiting the hospital wearing pebble lenses and a shabby suit? Wearing what? In order to pass yourself off to my clerk, who had never then met you, as a man called Armitage? Oh, now look here, Simon. Doesn't it all fit? The dinner party you gave the night of the murder, to which you knew I wasn't coming. The old man, fuddled with wine, an easy and unsuspecting victim. My own late arrival home, with you waiting in the shadows? Simon, what are you saying? The vin du valais you knew only I drank? The police you failed to call when I was lying injured in your home, the clocks you so carelessly forgot to put forward. My missing keys, the forged letter found in my desk. Opportunity was there! Simon, for God's sake, stop! You're saying I killed him. Well I-- I didn't, I didn't do any of these things, why on Earth should I? Well, what possible motive could I have? I'm coming to that, Major. Please be patient. My Lord, may I now have sight of the Armitage letter, Exhibit Six? Thank you. My Lord, I-- I've been extremely remiss. I find I'm unable to continue the cross examination of this witness, unless I again recall my clerk, Mr. Milburn. There is one point I forgot to put to him which is vital to my present line of questioning, my Lord. My Lord, your Lordship has rightly expressed your willingness to give the prisoner every assistance. But does your indulgence extend to his reducing the witness box to the level of a bedroom door in a French farce? I forgot about a single question. You might have done the same. That'll do, Mr. Crawford. I beg your pardon, my Lord. Major Maitland, stand down for a moment. But, you will not leave the court. Mr. Milburn, go back into the witness box, please. [Simon] I'm sorry to bother you again, Mr. Milburn. But, there is one point I forgot to put to you, regarding the possible relationship between the envelope delivered to chambers and the corresponding letter found in my desk at home. You've never actually seen that letter, have you? No, sir. Would you look at it now, please? Do you notice anything unusual about it? Apart from the fact that it's typed in red, I mean. No, sir, I don't think so, sir. The signature doesn't look much like an educated person's, but that's about all. Although the fact that it is typed in red is in itself odd. Very odd indeed, sir, yes. But it is not typed in red, is it? But you just said that-- Mr. Milburn, the original letter from Armitage was typed in red. The letter you now hold is a copy prepared in my solicitor's office last night, but typed in green. Are you colorblind, Mr. Milburn? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I am. Why did you never say so before? It never occurred to me. Or did you deliberately conceal it? No, sir, to me it's of no importance. One learns to live with a minor disability like that. Well, wasn't it a great handicap to you in your army career? Not particularly, sir, no. Not in the Royal Corps of Signals, with all those colored lights and things? No, sir. Now, would it surprise you to learn that no branch of the Royal Signals has any knowledge of you? And that the war office has no record that you ever served in the army at all? Uh, I'm sorry, sir, I'm afraid I haven't been quite frank with you. Wouldn't seem so, no. Forgive me, sir, I never was in the Royal Signals. I was never in the army at all. Then why did you say you were? I wanted to work in the temple, sir. And I thought that by saying I was in the army, I would stand a better chance than by straight away admitting the truth, that's all. Oh, and just what was the truth? I was unfit, sir. I worked in a munitions factory. So you've lied to me and to the court. In that respect, yes. Well, is the court to regard the rest of your evidence in the light of this admission? Now, that's the only matter on which I've not told the whole truth. But, how is the jury to know that? I hope they'll take my word for it. Look, sir, if I've offended you, I apologize, sincerely. It was a stupid thing to do, and I'm sorry. But, why keep attacking me, sir? What are you trying to get at? I'm trying to get at the truth, Mr. Milburn. Yesterday in this court, Major Maitland was accused of being a hostile witness, not to me, but to the crown. Today, I accuse you of being hostile, not to the crown, but to me! But, that's just not true, sir. What is your name? My name, sir? Isn't it John Logan? No, sir. John Logan was a man convicted of a serious robbery with violence in this courtroom 20 years ago. My Lord, I must object most strongly to this-- You may sit down, Mr. Naylor. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. But I just don't understand, sir. What's that got to do with me? I suggest a great deal. Because on that occasion, after sentence, John Logan threatened to kill the presiding judge and the prosecuting counsel. The presiding judge was Sir Matthew Gregory. The prosecuting counsel was myself. You succeeded with one, haven't you, Logan? My Lord, I can not agree to this. Sit down, Mr. Naylor. My Lord, may I speak? Mr. Crawford keeps attacking me, sir. Just answer the questions, Mr. Milburn. If there is anything improper in any of them, I shall not allow them to be put. Would you look at these photographs, please? You remember them being taken? No, why should I? Because they're pictures of you. No. But your name is on them, look at the back. The name Logan is written here. That's what I mean, your name is written there by the prison when they were taken in 1943. My name's not Logan, and these are not pictures of me! You can't prove that though, can you? I don't have to. Oh, you may have to. Look at the eyes, Logan. A man's eyes don't change. Other features, perhaps, but not his eyes. And your eyes give you away, Logan. His Lordship will see those photographs in a moment, so will Mr. Naylor, and so will the jury. What will you say if they decide they're pictures of you, Logan, what will you say then? Stop calling me Logan! I ask you, Logan, what will you say? I shall say my name is not Logan. But it was Logan in prison though, wasn't it? It wasn't until you escaped that you changed it to Milburn, when you set out to destroy the judge and me. That's absurd. You became a clerk in my chambers, Logan. And for years you studied the judge and me, there wasn't a thing about us you didn't know. And then, Logan, you waited. You waited until you saw your opportunity in the tragedy of my daughter's death. No! It was you, Logan, who posed as Armitage to frame me for a murder I did not commit. It was you, Logan, who in your insane desire for revenge, took up that knife and stabbed to death an innocent old man, with no more conscience than when you shot the bank clerk 20 years ago. That's not true! You murdered Gregory, Logan. No, no! Just as you said you would all those years ago, standing where I am now. That's true, Logan. Isn't it, Logan? It's lies, all lies! Why do you keep calling me Logan? Because that is your name! Because you are Logan. How could I be Logan? Logan is dead! What did you say? How do you know Logan is dead? I read it somewhere in the papers. You did not! It was never reported in the papers. How do you know Logan is dead? The truth is, Logan, he's not dead, is he? The truth is he's alive, and you are he! No, no! Then I ask you once more, how do you know Logan is dead? Answer me! We are waiting, sir. You clever, tricky bastard! I said I'd kill you. And by God, I will! [gunshot] [overlapping commotion] Silence! [Logan shouting] Simon, are you all right? Yes, I'm all right, how bout you? Yes. My Lord, that is the case for the defense. ♪♪ [roaring]
