LIFE THE WAY IT IS Card. Another. Stick. ...Between social forces and levels of production. Social education will never disappear until we see the development of productive forces broad enough to contain... That's enough. Stop! Hello. Hey, my dress suits you. You look lovely. So has your dad found a flat? Bagnolet. Two rooms in a housing project. You wanted a bit of life, right? I've got an office job at a chemical products firm. Near Duplex subway station. What about you? Here. With your dad? - Not in his department... Yes. He's hired you as a secretary? Of course not. Below that. Sounds cushy. - How did you get on at school? - Not great. I'd better tell Mum. - Want me to come? - No, I'll do it. See you in an hour at Gallieni? OK. See you later. What are you doing here? Mind my boss doesn't see you. Why aren't you at school? I'm leaving. Are you mad? I'll call the principal. The head teacher, you mean. There's no point, he already knows. It's over. What about your exams? Are you crazy? It's a boy, isn't it? Tell the truth! Think what you like. I'm 18, you can't stop me. It's Florence. Money can buy anything! Florence will always get by. Thanks to her dad! But you, with no qualifications... The sacrifices I made, so you could make your way and become someone! Why are you abandoning me? I'll visit you. That's what your dad said when he left. I promise. You think you will. But life is tough. You'll be tired in the evenings. And on Sundays... you'll go and see your friends... your lover... Weren't you happy here? I need to learn about life, to grow up. Anyway, I was hardly ever home. Yes, but I had a daughter to wait for every day. I was useful. All I have to look forward to now is growing old alone. Don't cry. I'll come and visit. I swear. It's sad. You'll get used to it. How did your dad find a flat so quickly? Through the staff representative on his works council. I don't get it. He's on the local council. Your dad's great. I really like him. Are you in love with him too? Don't be silly. It took my mum 20 years to get low cost housing. He doesn't want to make it easy for us. He thinks I'm going to be a manager one day. - Hello. - Hello, girls! Are you the concierge? Here. You're here for the flat. What is it, Mrs Léontine? The lady on the 7th floor has jumped out the window. They've called the police. It's dreadful! Her head's all over the courtyard. Blood everywhere. Come quickly! Not again. It's dreadful! Wait here, I'll be right back. Hey, any more of this and we'll all need umbrellas! I want to see Auntie! - What's going on? - No, wait for the police. The lady from the 7th floor. Poor thing! Patrick, get back up here, now! See that? She bounced like a marble. Looks like sheep's brain. Patrick, I told you not to touch corpses! No, don't look, Mr Julien. Just think, that's two in 7 months. - Surely not! - Oh yes. You'll see, people are unhappy in these big projects. Why? No one knows each other. People meet in the lifts but never talk. Here we are. They used to have stairs. Ah, the stairs were lovely. You had more time to meet people. You'd chat, get to know each other. Rich and poor alike. People mixed more. Are people really so sad? Yes, but the most unhappy are the elderly and the housewives. Especially those who expected a lot from life. In the afternoons, they wait for happiness that never comes. They often kill themselves when they're pregnant. Well, you're very chatty. Oh, but I'm different. I used to do amateur dramatics. I'll tell you about it. I live here. Not in the lodge? No. I'll tell you about it. Here's the key. See you later. It's furnished. I told you, my dad arranged it. My books! They were at home. He must have had them sent over. He did the decorating? Probably. Thanks. What for? Being here with me. Being my friend. My chosen sister. I'm so happy. How about you? I don't know. Are you sad? You're crying? - I'm a bit scared. - Of what? Don't tease me. I get a bit anxious sometimes. I've always been wary of new people, new things. Silly, isn't it? And I've left my mother. - You miss her? - A bit. You're a big girl. Yes, I'm a big girl now. Come here. Don't be afraid. We're together. I'll protect you. You're my little girl. I'll never leave you. - You think so? - I swear it. What about you? You know very well. Take the white card, write down this figure and file it. File all the cards at once, you'll save time. He's not in the office right now. Can he call you back? I don't know... Pay attention, tomorrow you'll be on your own. Sorry, miss. No, we use first names here. I'm Véronique. We all wear name badges. Why? I don't know and I don't care. It's Lambert's idea. He's the boss. Careful, Pineau is trying to catch us out. He's got no badge. We're not allowed to call managers by their names. They'll give you a badge tomorrow. Dear... sir... comma... He's a bastard. Anything wrong? No, it's Pineau. He loves innocent girls. Every couple of weeks, one of them freaks out. That's Lambert, the boss. Handsome, isn't he? The one in blue is Chauvel, head manager. The last one is the staff representative. Hey, cut it out! - Shall we take the next one? - You'll be in trouble. We'll be like that soon. No, we'll be bosses. You can't beat a chauffeur driven car! Watch out, I'm a groper! Rm a groper! Sir, I am a groper! Good morning. Ten minutes late. Don't worry, it doesn't matter. Oh? You mustn't be an hour late every day. - Can we be a bit late? - That depends on Mr Pinault. If he likes you, fine. If he doesn't... Good morning. I'm late. Now then, miss, what about this text? It's "madame". I'm married, you know. I've just finished. No, no. "Horizon... last year... "The economic and financial prospects are worrying... "the disparity... common market... "Some countries are more. Oh no, miss. I didn't say: “In certain old, fashioned countries...“ It was: “In certain old fashioned countries, tradition..." I did wonder. I didn't dare ask what it meant. But you must ask. You should have come to my office. Spelling is important. Ah, Spelling! "Horizon" takes an H. "Auspicious" has a C in it. Would you read these 3 words? "The economic and financial prospects..." Financial, yes. It's a qualifying adjective. Meaning it refers to "prospects" so it takes... - An S? - Well done! Now where's the pencil? MS. - Why are you upset? - You'll fire me. No, relax. Come with me. We'll get some fresh air. My feet hurt. I'm tired. By the way, how much was your dress? I nicked it. No! God, I'm beautiful! Whenever I pass him in the corridor I want to touch his willy. Isn't he sexy? His willy's stirring. I like his arse best. How can you go for jerks like that? Thanks a lot. They're going on holiday. The grandma is a liability, so they send her to hospital. They'll pick her up in a month. They've paid me to visit her now and again. It's terrible. I'm used to it. There's so many to visit in August, I don't have time to see them all. Did you see that show on TV last night? Johnny was on. No, I only ever watch movies. I'd like to, but my husband chooses. He doesn't like movies. They're too fast, he doesn't understand everything. Men are better off with sport. It's nice. Now and then, when there's a nice, romantic film on, I fancy going to the neighbour's but I don't dare. He'd get angry and end up hitting me. Johnny's the one for me. He's gorgeous! He is handsome. My husband looks like him when he's asleep. Last night he was on his bike. Driving along at 120 mph. He'll kill someone! He's desperate. He hates society. He thinks only of impossible love. He wants to die on his motorcycle. Motorcycles are gorgeous! What do you know about desperation? Forget about stars. You should show an interest in the elderly. Insolvent, abandoned and uncared for. Oh, it's always about elderly people with you. That's because you're old! Me, I'm fine. I'm fine, really. Not like the other girls. They all want to sleep with the bosses. When they can't, they throw a wobbly. Scream the place down. No sense of propriety. I don't cheat on my husband. The manageresses all fancy Lambert. But he only likes youngsters! So they take it out on us. I keep quiet and stay out of the way. They're manageresses after all. The girls aren't very cultured. They're dumb! I only talk to them about babies. Only I can't tell them how beautiful my darling is. They'd be too jealous. There. Finished. I'm even happy in my work. I didn't know what to do earlier. So I asked my boss, Mr Pineau. He said to put these 6000 printouts into bundles of ten. Here they are, 600 of them. Because 600 times 10 equals... 6000! Right. Well, anyway, they're useless. People moan about doing pointless things. I enjoy it. Keeps me busy. Anyway it's up to the boss. He pays my wages. For 8 hours a day. Then comes the nice stuff: washing up, kitchen, housework... Especially my darling. No, it's true. I'm fine. Don't tell anyone, though. It'll make them jealous! I knew you'd get lost. This place is awful. Come on up. What's wrong? I don't know, you've... become a woman. What makes you say that? Hard to say. A general impression. Your look. It's more arrogant. More tender too. You're slimmer. Your mouth, your perfume... Then I'm beautiful! Yes, very beautiful. Anyway, forget about wooing kids. Florence is waiting for us. As a woman, what do you make of prostitution? As a woman, I wish you'd talk less, pick up a knife, and help me. That's telling me! Pass the knife. Here. That's not how you do it. Take a cloth... Hang on, I'm concentrating. - Know what I think? - Leave me alone. - You're doing it on purpose! - No, really. You want me to tell you to stop, then you can carry on reading. You're doing OK. Keep it up. What now? I want to ask you something. What? I'd like to kiss you. On the forehead. Hello, Dad. I told you, it's Pierre, not Dad. Sure it is, Daddy. I wanted to ask you... When will you be 43? What do you make of Lambert's workers? Not much. I pity people who spend their lives like that. - What about Lambert? - I don't know him. I do. I've met him. Seems charming. A bit old fashioned. He doesn't like unions. What's to be done? Nothing. He gets it from old Gustave, his father. He was traumatized by the 1936 Matignon Agreements. When the Nazis came along, he was a sympathizer. They restored his authority. What became of him after the war? He carried on developing his business and training his son to take over. Stop it. I know where this is going. Don't blame the father. From what I've seen all bosses are the same: individualistic, hypocritical, tight fisted. - Close to their legacy. - Tight fisted! And the people who work for them are treated like slaves. Don't exaggerate, Florence. I think their language has changed. Their language, yes. But their behaviour... She always exaggerates. In my job, I get to meet quite a few. Get up, you bunch of stiffs! Wake up! You're all dead! Corpses, you're nothing! You want to kill me! I don't want to die! I want to learn to live! Get up, you bunch of stiffs! Wake up! You're all dead! Nothing but corpses! You want to kill me too, don't you? Well, I don't want to die! I want to learn to live! I'm young! Young, you hear? Leave me alone! You too, listen up! Wake up! Get up! Get up! Does this happen often? Most Saturdays. The gunfire's not as bad as it was. It's dreadful. Shouldn't you come and live at home? I know. I'll take you out, for a change. Where to? How about a movie? There's no cinema round here. Let's go dancing, then. There are no clubs. We'll find something interesting. There's nothing around here. It's a wilderness. We'll walk the streets, look in the shops. No streets, no shops. There's nothing round here. You need a car to get to Paris. What do the kids do? Nothing. They get bored, drink and fight. I understand. How could you? You live in a nice part of Paris. Coming, then? OK, but we'll pay with your cheque book. Hello, girls. Is it about the rent? Could you come back later? Sure. Bye. I'll drop by later. It's OK, I can wait. I'll go and feed my cats. I'll take my bag. My pension's in there. 800 francs! - Have you got the keys? - No, you've got them. Here, pussy, pussy. Come and eat. Here, pussy. Staying there? Then I'll come to the cellar. You've got it coming, little sod! Hello. Can I come in? Hello. Sit there. In this? No, I'll take a chair. Sit down. I've had enough. I hate the end of the month. I have to chase up the rent. It's no fun. Do many people not pay? You've no idea! Doesn't stop them buying nice cars, though. As a concierge, you learn a lot about life. - ls the caretaker here? Yes. What now? It's Mrs Léontine, in the cellar. She's covered in blood. I think she's had her throat cut. Come quickly. See? Her bags open. Poor thing! And for only 800 francs. You mean it'd have been worth it for more? What's wrong? What's going on? I'm going to do you a big favour. This morning, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I was... dazzled! I'm beautiful. I've always known it. But I suddenly realised just how my face... my body... my whole being was... divine... sublime... I felt moved. I decided to be good. And to do someone a favour. You're all crazy about me. You're the one I've chosen. To do what? Look. You've waited a long time for this. Acknowledge my generosity. Gaze at the splendour. Pleasure for you. Just you wait. And afterwards... I'll let you touch me with your fingertips. Well, when you're ready... You're lucky to work here. On? Why? People are mean and cruel. Here, too, you may think. But Mr Lambert is a good man. - Have you worked here for long? - 23 years. I knew Mr Lambert when he was young. Back then his father, Mr Gustave, ran the company. A great master. The old kind. His son is a bit like him. Only simpler. Mr Lambert junior... he looked like Gary Cooper. All the women were mad about him. But he married a schemer. He wanted a child. She arranged it on the quiet. Then one day, she left him. For her mechanic. A loser: ugly... common... What did he do? He got a divorce. Men are so naive. She took him for everything. He suffered a lot. Then he remarried. His second wife was less pretty but more reliable. And very rich. And he's never cheated on her? Not the first one. Never. But the second is different. They're always extremely young. What does his wife say? His wife is a real woman. A great lady. Men are like big kids. They like to feel masterful. Tell me, Miss Legrand, how do you know all this? Could you come here a moment? Notice these letters? F is Friday, S is Saturday. I change them every day. I had an arrangement with the former tenant. If ever the letter doesn't change, it means I'm dead. Please let someone know, so I'll be buried quickly. Sure, but why would it happen? Once, on the 13th floor, the neighbours noticed a bad smell. They saw worms crawling out from under the door. They knocked, no one answered. I called a locksmith. The tenant had been dead for two weeks. His face was all black. There were flies everywhere. And worms coming out of his eyes, his mouth, his nose... I almost fainted. The neighbour went in with her ten year old kid. The girl saw the corpse... and laughed. I live alone. I don't want that to happen to me. You understand. I'm sick of getting up in the morning. Watch out, it's Pineau. You're scared of the nasty cat. The mice can relax. The nasty cat went off in a car. Great! You look rough. I can't get used to early mornings. Glad to hear it. How old are you? Twenty. Twenty two days of work a month, that's another 11,300 early mornings. That many? Just think of the boredom: an hour of filing or rubber stamping. Come on, concentrate. It takes so long! Forty hours a week is 2000 hours a year. That's 100,000 hours - one tenth of a million - before retirement. Meals and travel is another 30,000 hours. That's 130,000 in all. You've got a nerve! Anything wrong? At least I'll get a pension. Except manual workers die young. And you'll only have a pension to live on. The kids will dump you. You'll be old, lonely and sick. Death will be a relief. That's uncalled for. File documents, grow old, die... It's no life. Nope! Serves you right. How much have we got? Jerks like you should be sent to a work camp! Ten francs. What shall we buy? It's all we've got for the week. Pasta and rice? How did we spend so much? I bought nothing special. How much was that dress? Not much. Are you kidding? I'd rather have had some steak. Can't you borrow off your mum? Are you crazy? What about your dad? We said we'd manage, like everyone else. Well, everyone else borrows. I know. My mum has spent her life asking for advances. Carve him up! Go on, he's a dick! Skin him! What are you waiting for? Go ahead! Go on! You're a real man. My head! Stay away! In that mood, they might do anything. Call the police! They've been called but they're under staffed. Too risky. They're fetching reinforcements. Have you lived here long? Coming up to 15 years. And before that? In town houses, in Paris. 18th district. When I was a kid, life was much harder than it is now. My family were often destitute. But people mixed more. We did dumb things but there were always nice people to take your hand, like schoolmasters, priests... I know. It sounds funny to say it nowadays. You had an unhappy childhood? Yes and no. It depends. I despised my father. He thought I was too girly. I used to put make-up on in secret. I'd dress up in front of the mirror. With my friend Tardieu. We used to go dancing at the church hall. He'd call up to me. Plazanet! Plazanet! My father at the window: "Who's that? You're not going!" Did your dad beat you? With his belt. Hard! Only I used to scream before he hit me. That only made him madder and he'd hit me even harder. My sister Marguerite copped it worst. One day he was mad at her. She ran round the table. He couldn't catch her so he threw a fork at her head. Only she ducked... and it hit me! Stuck in my head, right here. No one dared take it out. In the end, my mother removed it when she got home from work. When he died, he spent two days moaning in bed, in the room next door. No one could sleep. My sister cried. I was pleased. So you've never known happiness? Yes, of course! Thanks to the movies. There, I'd forget everything. My sister and I adored it. She loved Gary Cooper and Tyrone Power. For me, it was Annabella, Greta Garbo, Jeanette McDonald... It was lovely. I'm older now, I can't reach the notes! My sister and I were crazy. We couldn't wait for the weekend. Eleven times. Eleven times I saw Camille. Robert Taylor was so handsome! When he throws his winnings in Greta Garbo's face... How could you afford to see so many films? The cinema was cheap back then! When workers went out, that's where they'd go. There were lots more cinemas in Paris. We'd go to the ldéal, the Lumiére, the Metropole, the Fantasia... They had lovely names! Names to make you dream. The cinemas were packed back then. Sitting down, among the crowds... The red seats, the smell of the theatre... And the curtains. It was always magical. First they'd move... then they'd open... None of those cinemas are around any more. They've been knocked down or turned into supermarkets and parking lots. Is he making this champagne himself? I'm worried. He went down half an hour ago. - Will you check? - Come with me. Go down, I'll be right with you. Tell us where it is! Why? Where is it? Stop bluffing. I'm sick of it! Hey, douchebag, where's the cash? What's this? Look what he's wearing! - How do I look? - Great. - Loser! - He's bald! All right, Serge Lama? Enough messing about. Where's his money? Pull his pants down. Cut him. He's too pathetic, I can't. You're chickening out. Get lost. You do it. Sleep with me first? Prove you're a real guy. What are you waiting for? Are you chicken? I'll do it. Pull his pants down. Watch out! Snitch on us, bitch, and you're dead. Where's Muriel? Haven't seen her. She went to Records, with Pineau. Muriel? Muriel? It's me, Agnés. Leave me alone. Open up, there's no one here. Don't be silly, you can't stay there all night. Come on! Don't stay there, you look ridiculous. What's wrong? Won't you tell me? You went to Records, with Pineau. Is it him? He locked the door. He said I'd get a raise. He started to touch my breasts. Harder and harder. I tried to fight him off, he just got more excited. He grabbed my hand and tried to put it down his pants while he kissed me on the mouth. I tried to slap him. He twisted my arm. He got out his... and put my hand on it. I slapped him. Hard. Then he fired me! And you let him? There'll be trouble if my husband finds out. He'll beat me, then leave me. That's ridiculous, you haven't done anything! - We'll ask the staff rep. No. Pull yourself together. Come on! What is it'? Go on, tell him. This was your idea. It's Pineau. He dragged her into Records and tried to rape her. Rape? Are you sure? It's not his style. He usually feels up girls' breasts and tries to get them to touch him. So you know about him? Off the record, of course. No one ever reported it before. Too scared. It's outrageous! Anyway, she defended herself. She slapped him. Now she's been fired. Sit down, tell me what happened. Any witnesses? No. Who notified you about being fired? The personnel office. What did they say? That they were dissatisfied with me. Nothing else? Was Pineau there? Were you on a trial period? On a contract, for another two days. We can't do much, there are no witnesses. When you're on a contract, you can be let go at any time. Pineau's done it before. Let's go. This is too much! So he wins and no one minds? We'll go and see Lambert, he's the boss. I don't want to go. What shall we do? We'll go anyway- Come in. It's a real nuisance. I'll do my best. Sit down. Yes, thanks a lot. You don't have an appointment. I hate to be disturbed. It can't wait. You might at least apologise. Go ahead, then. So, go ahead. Mr Pineau tried to rape one of your employees. She fought him off, now she's been fired. We want this injustice put right. Switchboard? Get me Pineau. He's left? He's gone? Are you sure? Thanks. Why are you so sure it's why she was fired? It's happened before. And you only report it to me now? We'll look into it tomorrow. Did you wait till tomorrow before firing my colleague? Don't speak to me like that! By the way, where is your colleague? She's scared of you. Everyone's afraid around here. Except you. Any evidence for this incident? He's crafty. You can't let him get away with it. I know what to do. And don't insult my managers. Just ask the staff. I've heard some gossip. Get me the personnel manager. You've just fired a girl. What's her name? Muriel Pucheux. For what reason? Is that all? Didn't she complain? Send the file up. Your colleague was hired on trial. She wasn't suitable, Mr Pineau let her go. Professionally speaking, he was right. I'll keep you posted. OK, you may leave. What about Muriel? As I said, I'll keep you posted. You want a cake? Would you like my job? As union delegate? Yes and no. You know, Lambert has never... Never tolerated a trade union group. He wants complete control. I'm just a staff representative on the works committee. What exactly is the works committee? I'll explain. Anyway, ours is only symbolic. What about you? I'm leaving, I've had enough. Of Lambert? The staff too. I'm sick of defending them with no backing. How come? Everyone is afraid of Lambert. Some people come along and lodge complaints. But they don't make a fuss. They're scared to stick up for themselves. The day I was elected, Lambert sent me a bottle of champagne. - Even offered me a raise. Oh? To congratulate me on my victory. He's a smart one. Did you accept? We're barely tolerated. He's holding all the cards. A rep once refused. He lasted 6 months. Was he fired? No need with Pineau around. See you tomorrow. Can't we just spoil it? It invalidates the ballot. There's only one name. Any word from Pineau? No one's seen him since. How long has it been? Two weeks. Seems Lambert listened to you. I hear Lambert threw him out. Apparently he's on diplomatic leave. He may be sent to work in the annex. - Your involvement had an effect. - Good. But Muriel's out of a job. Are you still leaving? If you're ever round my way, drop in. I'd like that. You get home late these days. I have to prepare the meeting with Lambert, next week. - I've been elected. - I heard. Look... this came for you. From your boss. I signed for it. Lambert wastes no time. Great, champagne! Can I have some now? Are you crazy? I'm sending it back! You and your principles! We could have some fun. Not like that we couldn't. Come in. Good morning, sir. I want rid of her. Do what you like. But we have nothing against her. We can't fire her without following the proper procedures. For 15 months. Make her leave of her own accord. I take it I've been reinstated in my old job? Thank you, sir. Don't worry, you're right. It's for the best. An example to the staff. Goodbye, sir. You know, it's strange. An almost physical sensation of pleasure. Especially the smells. The earth, the leaves... Look... look at this tiny flower. I'm very moved. It's extremely beautiful. You're funny, you know. Why? The things you're doing to seduce me. I'm not doing anything special, you know. Fancy not liking nature. Don't you feel this... this joy? Don't go on about it. You do like nature! I always have. Listen to the silence. The quality of the silence. It's true. I'd never noticed that nature was silent. No, it isn't silent, it's... Listen. The wind in the branches... the birdsong... I'd never noticed before. Close your eyes. Imagine the sky... All blue... and yet filled with stars... And the tiny flower. Very tiny. That maybe no one has ever seen. Will you pick it for me? No, are you crazy? Why kill it? It's enough that I showed it to you. I'd like to ask you something. Promise you won't be angry. - You won't be angry? - I don't know. I wanted to ask you... You'll make fun of me! Close your eyes. I'd like you to stand up beside that little flower... Don't be angry. I'd like you to undress. MEETING. Management rejects all our suggestions out of hand. When we will have a decent life, free from pushy managers? A library, holidays, and parties for our children? It can't go on. We must threaten strike action! Good morning, Agnés. Mr Pineau is waiting to see you. - He's back? Yes. Good morning, Prosper. Sit down. There's no point. I'd like to speak to Mr Lambert. That won't be possible. Mr Lambert is off for a week. I'm here to replace him. Speaking of which, Miss Tessier... we're reorganising our departments. Your job will cease to exist. So who will replace me? No one will replace you. That girl you saw doesn't have your remit. But we have nothing for you. You can't dismiss me. That isn't an option. We're creating a job for you. You'll have an office to yourself. There. You'll be fine here. We'll tidy it up a bit. Anyway, you're not stuck up, are you? What's the gentleman doing? Him? Oh, he's retired. He just helps out. So what do I do? Add up these vertical columns. Then the horizontal ones. Where's the machine? No machine. And you'll be timed. I refuse. Well, you're under no obligation. Unfortunately you're surplus to requirements. You can always leave, if you like. Right. Good luck. And if you need anything, just come and see me. Good morning. Have you seen my card? I have to take it up to the office whenever you're late. Really? It's not my doing. I know. 6 plus 8 is 14, plus 3 is 17, plus 8 is 25... plus 9 is 34... plus 7 is 41... plus 7 is 48... plus 7 is 55... I need the entries for March 3rd. Sorry? Who do you want? This isn't 234? - No, 243. - I'm sorry. Mr Pineau would like the latest figures. OK, I'm coming. You little bitch! I'll get you! Good morning. Can I have the figures? I keep being disturbed. Disturbed? Here? What kind of excuse is that? I get the feeling you're a bit lazy. You've no right. I'll give you 15 minutes. Mr Lambert wants to see you. Can't it wait a moment? Right now. OK, I'm coming. Now where's my badge? Mr Pineau is looking for you, miss. He seems angry. Really? OK, thanks. How come we can never find you? Where's your work? Don't waste your breath. Your insolence is out of place. Not only are you lazy, you lack any sense of politeness! Take a look at yourself! What's going on? Sir, Miss Tessier refuses to do her work. I can't field calls, be summoned to your office, and work. My office? I only just got here. She's always like this. Until now I've been nice about it. Tell me, Mr Pineau. Why do staff reps always try to exploit their position? - Anything to say? - Don't waste your breath. I told you. You ought to be ashamed. Your colleagues have faith in you. What have you decided to do, sir? There's nothing to be done. Since it's of no use to you... Agnés Tessier is a filthy dyke, a whore and a bitch Say, bitch. You wouldn't be so stupid if I'd fucked you. We'll get you, whore. Be man enough... You gonna move your fat arse out, socialist whore? Quick, or we'll get you! Who is this? A well wisher. Switchboard? This is 243. Who just called me? Outside line. Could you ask the name of the caller? I'm not allowed to. You'll have to ask Mr Lambert. OK, thanks. Communist filth! I thought so. I've been trying to call you for 15 minutes. You go too far! You know, no one can abide you. Don't waste your time, I'm not leaving. I won't be insulted on the phone. Take it away. The girl is mad. Garcia! Take away the phone. And the desk. But the desk is screwed to the wall, sir. Screwed to the wall? Definitely. - Makes you sick. - Honestly! Looks like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. Fancy a whore like that being elected staff representative! Unbelievable! What's the point of you? You don't stop me coming out, you never follow me. You sit there all day, doing nothing. What's the point of you? Don't be angry with me. I just do as I'm told. I have to earn a living. No. Lambert is wrong. The era of being boss by divine right is over. I pity young Agnés Tessier. She's right. Morally and legally. Well... in principle. Still, she lacks diplomacy. Not enough experience or clout. Plus she's a woman. I'm all for women. They must be given the jobs they deserve. But... not yet. Once they've learnt. You shouldn't rush things. Basically Lambert is a decent chap. Put yourself in his shoes. A little traumatised by youth, by technocracy... but... basically sound. You have to know how to take him. Now I have to support this girl. But how? As far as staff goes... it's better to maintain a distance. They'd get the wrong idea, my authority would be undermined, so my career.. What to do? Best just let things run their course. In time... Time is very important. Diplomacy. I'd chuck those girls in jail. That's her. Are you sure? Positive. She lives with the older girl. Disgraceful, at her age. Only just back? What about the shopping? Someone is saying things about me behind my back. At work and here. You're talking rubbish. I'm not. The girls at work gossip about me. Even those who like me. Look, go and do the shopping. Get over this persecution complex. I'm really fed up of your troubles. Now you're starting too. Wait... Wait! What? Sit down, I want to talk to you. Tell me... have you been seeing my father recently? No, why? You're lying. Nothing to say? Stop beating about the bush. I know everything. Even about you making love with my father. You'd like to know how I found out. From a friend and well wisher. So you're sleeping with my father. Is he good in bed? Shut up. So now I have to shut up? The girl I regarded as my best friend is acting like a tart. Like a slut. With my father! And I have to shut up? I'll never forgive you. Oh, I almost forgot. I'll take these back. I'll collect my things tomorrow. You're leaving? We have nothing more to say. Hi, Agnés. - Didn't she leave a note? - No. Neither did the gentleman. Here. Drink this. Her father was here. You know, your friend didn't just leave because of your argument. You know? You hear everything in these flats. No, there's something else. The rumours about you... What rumours? You might as well know. Someone dropped insults and slander in all the letterboxes about you and your friend. Probably in the night. I tried to intercept them but I couldn't get them all. Did you keep any? I threw them all away. Why didn't you tell me? It was rather delicate. Why don't you quit your job, if that's what they want? Won't you stay awhile? I'll keep you company. You're unwell. - May I come in? - Of course! You take the bed. I'll sleep in the armchair. Won't you stay with me? I'm afraid. Afraid? I get like that when I'm alone. I'm afraid of the dark, I think about death. Stay with me, dear. You called me dear. How lovely! I'll stay with you. I'll protect you. Sleep well. How can you bear life? Well, I force a smile for everyone. And when things are really bad... I focus on the little things: the laundry... the housework... the washing up... Little things are important. Maybe they're what keep us hanging on, clinging to life. Watch out, I'm a groper! Watch out! I'm a groper. I'll grope you! Yes, I grove! Watch it, I grope! I grope! Watch it! Yes, sir, I'm a groper! Sir! Look at that beard! I'm sorry if this man offended you. If you want to hit someone, go ahead, hit me. And they moan when men touch them. You need to get cleaned up. You think so? Watch it, I'm the guy who gropes! Watch it, I grope! | grope... grope! Young lady! Young lady, wait, I'll help you. Watch out, I grope. I saw you on the platform. I had to call them first, then find you. I told them you'd be late. That's nice of you. But Pineau... No, you'll be fine. What are you going to do with him? I don't know. Leave him. Shouldn't he go to hospital? Or a police station? No, they'd keep him. Look at him. He's harmless. Kiss me. Kiss me, please. Good morning. Is it Pineau? He came down when you were ten minutes late. He's waiting to see you. What is it'? Nothing, just the usual. Don't worry. So what was it this time? The alarm clock? A distant African cousin? Sir, see for yourself: 1 hour 53 minutes late. What do you have to say? You see, sir? Don't make it worse. You're right, I've been too patient. I'm requesting her dismissal. Send her file to the factory inspectorate. It must be chock full. Do you concur? Sir, I fear it won't be enough for the inspectorate. I don't need their approval. Later! - Later, I said! - No. Now. I was late too. That's different... I'm not talking to you. I called on her behalf. You're a disgrace, both of you. I've seen your little game. I didn't believe it. Now I know. See? She's dangerous... It's you who's dangerous! You're showing your true colours. And you're worse. You give the orders! Miss Leblanc, please leave! If you're sacking her, then sack me too. But I warn you, I'll fight. I'll tell every employee what you really are. You'll have your strike! Get out of here immediately! And him... he'd better leave. Should we not... You get out too! Haven't you got anything to do? Sign here. Yes, I agree with you. Thanks. Thanks. They're on your side, nearly all of them. Don't cry. Don't cry, it's over. I can't take any more. I'm ashamed. I should be thanking you. We all refused to see. Please, Florence, leave me alone. You're thinking about her too. I'm not feeling very proud of myself. Or of you, actually. We make a rotten pair. You're pulling my leg. I acted like a bastard because of you. Oh, come on. I want you to come with me. I'm going to see her. Come on. Please. Well... I'll take a taxi. Don't bother waiting for me tonight. Hello! How happy you look. It's good to see! Florence is back. Are you sure? I saw someone through the window. You can't have. I did, really. Stop it, you're crazy, you'll kill her! Hey, look! What can you do? Let's have a game of snooker. Come here, you lout!
