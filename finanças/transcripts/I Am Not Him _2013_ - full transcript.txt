No hello for me, buddy? - I nodded already. - Yes, you did! Are you coming with us tonight? Where to? Where the hell do you think? I'm busy tonight. What's with you? I'm busy, I said. Are you busy with that new broad? What broad? Her husband's in prison. She walks around all horny. She looks like she's going to eat you up. What are you talking about? What broad! Wash your hands, asshole! Hello. I’m at home. Yes, just sitting around. You’re down in the street? In front of the building? You go. Why do you put us through this torture? You’re single with a big apartment and we’re squeezed in the back of a car. Let's go to your home, then. We will, soon. How? Are you divorcing? God willing. Otherwise, I’ll kill her. Really? You’ll kill her? I can, why not? Sometimes, I go off the deep end. I want to wring her neck. Then, I think of the kids. Move! Buddy! Hey, man! Enough! Buddy! What’s wrong, man? What’s happening in there? Stop it! Stop it, motherfucker! Stop it! I said stop! Motherfucker! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Out. You’re worthless cowards. We have families and kids, man. How could I know this would happen? The police suddenly turned up. Nihat... Did you give our names? Did you really give them? You’re rotten bastards. You have no balls! Do you wash the dishes at home too? And food? Do you also cook? Yes. What do you cook? Potatoes and stuff. Noodles. Omelet. That kind of stuff. I cook really well. Everyone says so. If you want, come by tonight and I'll cook for you. What will you cook? Whatever you want. Aren't you coming, man? Well, bye. Come in. Go ahead. Let me serve you tea. Those are old pictures. It's the past. You can't see from there. Why don't you come over here? My eyes are getting worse. That's all fake. They're all acting. They are? Yes, all fake. Just actors. Do you like it? I do. Is it tasty? Delicious... My compliments to the cook. Whenever you like, I'll cook for you. Whenever I like? Whenever you like. Is your husband in prison? He is. How long has he been in? Three years. He has another seven to go. I should get going. Get going? It's late. See you. Is he in for forgery? Forging documents? How do you know? Everyone talks about it at the canteen. So they do... He went in for forgery. Inside, he killed two people. Because of insults. Insults? Inmates were swearing at me. So, he stabbed them. That's it. No way! When he worked at the shipyard, he hooked up with a friend. He got into forging signatures, forging documents. So I've heard. Seems you’ve heard everything. What else did you hear? What else? Nothing. Anything about me? I've heard nothing. Nothing. Nothing really? Nothing. Don't they call me a whore? I haven't heard that. So you haven't heard that? You’re very much like him. Do you know that? How long have you been married? Four years. I wanted a divorce, he beat me up. Tried to drown me. Drown you? Really? Yes. He held my head in the water. He was killing me. He pushed my head into a bucket. The neighbors saved me. So you didn't drown. Indeed, you’re really like him. You know that? I have a question. What about? That bitch... Is something going on between you? What bitch? You know what bitch I mean. What the fuck are you talking about? She's dangerous, man. Her husband stabbed some guys. You’re crazy, man. I have a pot on the stove. What are you looking at? Just looking. Why are you standing there? Did you say anything to anyone? Did I say what? About us, about me. No, what would I say? I don't know. What would I say? You never got married? No. Why? Why? I just didn't. So you've always been single? Single. Strange. Why is it strange? I don't know, it's just strange. Someone like you, I thought you'd be married. I'll tell you something but don't get mad. Shoot. Don't ever hide anything from me, alright? Just don't lie to me. Where did this come from? It just popped into my mind. What’s that? Get dressed. Tomorrow is visiting day. I have to bring him clean laundry. He got into a fight. They put him in solitary confinement. You couldn't see him? No. That was my last visit to him. Do you like it? You don’t like it? What is this? Do you like it or not? I do. It’s fine. I've had it for years. I wanted to wear it for you. Fine, so you have. We never had an occasion to go swimming. He never took me. What's this? Put it on. But why? Stupid idea. For heaven’s sake, I really want you to wear it. Please. Whose is it? Put it on, I'm begging you. Come on. Enjoy your meal. What's your problem? What problem? Do you want everyone to gossip? - Are you ashamed of me? - No, not at all. - That's not the point. - What is then? Whatever. Don't pretend you don't understand. - Besides... - Besides what? Don't drive me crazy! For crying out loud! Would you take me to the seaside? Are you mad at me? I’m not. Feel better? More tea? Thank you. We’ll take you home after the police station. I can go on my own. Your wife’s. Her body will be waiting at the coroner's. Are you ok? Hello. It’s me. I won't be coming in today. I’m busy. I have something to do... You tell them. See you. What the heck is that? What? Four eyes now. Prescription. My eyes are bad. Doctor's orders. Why didn't you come yesterday? We said you were sick. I was. Yeah, you look sick. Sick in the head, man. Are you waiting for a body? Who? Ayse Kara. Stay right here. Necip? Necip? Man, Necip! Buddy... My brother. When did you get out? Why didn't we hear about it? Just now... Why didn't you call, bro? My God! I was wondering if it was really you. Necip, my brother. Tell me about it, man. What should I tell you? I heard you got more time. When did they release you? My sentence... just finished. Does Suleyman know you’re out? No. What will you do now? Work? Nothing. I'm fine like this. We can talk to the company. They like you. It's been long time, anyway. Ok. We can talk. Did you get my greetings through your wife? Yes, thank you. Give me your phone number. Give it, man. 0 598... Yes... 612 4247. I’ll call you. I have to go. Where to, man? I have business to take care of. Yes... Ok. Ok... Our friend Necip is a hard worker. He used to work here before you. What were you in prison for? He was a victim of circumstance. I was asking him. I was a victim of circumstance... What circumstance, what victim? Actually, it's all here. But I want to hear it from you. Tell me one good reason why I should hire you. Brother Necip is very skilled. In the military, he saved my life. I asked him. It also says here his skills put him into prison. What the fuck is this? What? The mustache... It's gone. I shaved it off. What's up? You tell me what's up! Why haven't you picked up for days? And you're not coming to work. My phone's broken. And I had stuff to do. What stuff? I've had no news from you. Did something happen? Nope. What could have? Anything to do with that bitch? She's disappeared too. What bitch? What are you talking about? Both of you disappeared. Don’t take me for a fool. What are you up to? Good evening. Man, you fagot... Why didn't you tell me? What? That you broke out of prison. Why didn't you tell me, you shit? Is that your idea of friendship? You’re nuts. I swear to God, you’re crazy. You break out of prison, then parade in front of everyone! Where did you get such balls? You came to the shipyard looking for a job. What are you trying to do? What’s your problem? I don't have one. What do you mean, you don't? Man, you broke out of prison. Are you crazy? Where are you staying? I have a place. What about your wife? What about my wife? What's she doing now? - None of your business. - Fuck you! You don’t care about anyone but yourself. What are you going to do now? I don't know. How is that possible? Aren’t they after you? Are you a maniac? I’m not. You were strange before, but now you're really out there. Look... You can't stay here. You have to go elsewhere. Where am I supposed to go? I talked to a friend in Izmir. He'll arrange something for you in city ferries. He thinks you're my brother-in-law. Get it? Told him you're a good man. That you need help for a job. He said ok. Understand? You understand? I do. Arrange ID for yourself. I'll call you. Until then, hide. Don't go out. Wherever you're hiding, keep hiding. I'll be in touch. Then fuck off. Disappear. With this, we're even. Brother Necip! Tea! Tea! Did you find a place? I found something. Are you married? I’m not. Never married? She passed away. My condolences. Any kids? No. That's no good. You’re getting old. You have to find a wife. - How long have you been here? - Seven and half years. You don’t have a wife and kids? I never married. Are you married? She passed away. My condolences. What’s your name? Ali Dikici. And yours? Necip... Necip Kara. Nice to meet you. What are you looking at? I'm just looking. Fifty liras. What's your name? Fifty liras. Could you please tell me your name? What's my name to you? Really, what is it? Asiye. Is it your real name? What's it to you? What's your name, then? Why don't you say it? Necip. Half hour. Just so you know. I don't want to. What? I said, I don't want to. Come here. Lie here, beside me. I said come here. Why? Don't be afraid. Come here. Why are you staring at me? How did you find me? I just did. I wanted to talk to you. To talk about what? Your money? No, not the money. I’ll give your money back. No, keep it. Do you live here alone? There was someone else but she left. Why? Someone stabbed her. Is someone looking after you? Protecting you? You mean a pimp? He's the one who stabbed her. He's in jail now. He was stabbed there himself. What do you want from me? Who are you? Do you know how to cook? What? What's you real name? I told you. There's a different name on your ID. What does it say on yours? I told you. I told you too. Where are you from? From here, from there. What’s the difference? And you? Where are you from? Like you. From everywhere. When did you come to Izmir? Recently. It’s recent. Why did you come? Were you alone? Alone. I ran away. From who? Your family? They were going to marry me off. After my husband died. You had a husband? He died. In an accident. He drowned. You don't have any kids? No. You? I'm not married. No kids. You never married? My wife died. How? She simply died. How did she die? There was an accident. She died. And then? And then, what? You didn't re-marry? No, I didn't. Are you telling the truth?

You want to swim? - You want to swim? - What? Come here. Swim. Swim here! Swim! You want to swim? Swim! Swim! I found a job for you. This is where I saw the sea for the first time. I've never gone swimming. We'll go sometime. Don't move! So... You're not going to talk? You're not going to tell me? May I have a cigarette? You have your cigarette. Now talk. How did you escape? Anyone help you? We know what happened. But we also need to hear it from you. Talk to me! - Sir? - It's fine, stay outside. Looking at you, one would think you were a decent man. Someone denounced you. He recognized you immediately. Don’t you wonder who it is? You're making me angry! Very angry! Subtitling TITRA FILM Paris
