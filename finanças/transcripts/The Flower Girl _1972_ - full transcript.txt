In July or August you will receive good, long awaited news. Yes. In September or October you will find the man you have been looking for. Like a sparrow freed from its cage happiness will come to you. Really? Good fortune, indeed. Thank you. Goodbye. Well... Your father is dead, your brother is in prison. What's more, your mother is sick. I am so sorry for you. To top it all, isn't your little sister is blind? Tell me, has she been blind since birth? No. Because of illness? Not that either. Well? I see. A noble man will come to help you. I'm sure of it. You mother also, will be healed. Don't be dispirited. Are you staying a bit longer? When the sun sets in the West Rising now, the wind A young, blind girl Stands alone on the hill She awaits her sister Who has left to sell flowers To buy medicine for their mother Young girl alone on the hill Sun Hui. Sister. Sun Hui. You should be at home with mother. She's gone to Mr. Bae's. But she's ill. Landlord Bae scolded her for not sending you as a housemaid. But Madame Kim... You shouldn't have. Are you here to work as well? I was told to help the kitchen maid. You're working day and night. What can I do. I'm a slave in debt. We've no land of our own. Gan-Nan, what are you doing in there? How slow you are! When will you finish that washing? How tiresome. If you send Kotpun here, you'd have fewer mouth to feed. I'll do anything you want. But leave my daughter alone. Do you spare her heavy work to turn her into courtesan? If you send Kotpun here you'd have fewer mouth to feed. Do you spare her heavy work to turn her into courtesan? I mustn't die. If I die, she'll take my place here. And be treated like a slave. No! Madame Kim. You've not even eaten and still you're working. You should stop. Mrs. Kim. Come, try this. Where did you get it? The cook gave it to me. - You take it. - I've had some. Sun Hui, you must be hungry? No. What if Mum doesn't bring any rice? She will. Can't we buy some with the money you got from selling flowers? Sun Hui, be brave until we've bought the medicine for mother. I'll boil some water. Sis, Mum's coming. Listen, I can hear her footsteps. Sorry I'm late, Sun Hui? Mother. You're sick, you shouldn't be working. Don't worry. Mum, did you bring rice? Sister's boiled water. Sun Hui, eat this. Here. It's crispy rice! Kotpun, take it. You've had no lunch. I'm not hungry, give it to Sun Hui. Mum, take it. Big sister, you too. I nibbled a little. You can eat it all. Kotpun, I'll go to the neighbours to borrow some corn. Meantime, darn Sun Hui's socks. Show me your foot. That tickles. Mother, what does it mean "a noble man"? Why ask me, like this? Please. People say someone noble helps and makes happy poor people like us. If someone like that would come to help you, Like in the old tales, I could... leave this world without fear. I was told someone noble will appear soon. If your brother were here, you wouldn't suffer so much. But I'm sure he no longer belongs to this world. I was told that he would return and you would be healed. Really, Big Sis? Kotpun, whatever happens, take good care of Sun Hui. The poor thing's lost her father, brother, and even her sight. I worry so much for you I can't even die. To think Sun Hui would be motherless too. Mum, don't say such things. Every year when spring comes On the hill, in the fields Thousands of beautiful buds Finally open But for us who have no country Spring will never come When shall we have flowers blooming in our hearts? Up there, on the hill path Where they dragged our brother away With the coming of spring Beautiful flowers bloom But dear brother We wait hopefully Years go by of endless waiting When will he return? Big Brother, it's as big as me? Yes, it will grow with you. We'll plant other flowers here. We'll plant the magnolias mother loves so much. And touch-me-not as well. Well, what's your favourite flower, Sun Hui? I love that one. What are you doing here? Mr. Bae's looking for you. Hurry up. Kotpun. Let me have it. Kotpun! Why are you standing idle? Hurry to the backyard and gut the fishes. Quick! Come. Kotpun, go ahead. Play here. I'm foolish to entertain guests relying on them. Chol-Ryong, have you finished? I've one more round trip to make. Don't you dare touch it, you little pest? Ginseng! Sun Hui! Wild ginseng from my husband! What, my ginseng? It's your fault, brat! Heavens! What a mishap! She only brings bad luck! Sun Hui, lift your hands. We'll put soybean paste on it. Move your hands. Let me see, please. Don't cry, big brother is here. - Sun Hui! - Where are you? - I can't see anything! - Sun Hui, I'm here. - Your big brother is here. - Bring a light. Sun Hui, he's here. Where is he? I can't see him. How could such a thing happen to her? Life is so cruel. How could heaven take her sight? Sun Hui, I'm here, can't you see me? I can't see you. I can't see anything. Fire! Fire! - Watch your steps. - Good-bye. We count on you. Big Brother! What are you doing? How can we live without you? Don't cry. Take good care of Sun Hui. Mrs. Gan-Nan, please to take care of my mother. Mrs. Gan-Nan, what brings you here? Kotpun, have you had anything to eat today? A little... You can borrow some rice from Mr. Bae. Hunger makes any man a criminal. Let's go to get some. I know... you're determined never to set foot in that house again. But what can one do? Think of your sick mother. They claim to be very generous, but in Autumn they ask us to pay twice the principal. Two measures! This is the third measurement! Our lord, Mr. Bae has such a good heart, he takes pity on you and lends you rice. So, remember his generosity! Now five measures for Yoon-chil. Five measures? Yoon-chil! Do you know how much you'll owe me this Autumn? You don't know? That's why you want to take so much. Let's see. Last time, you took three measures when your wife died. How will you repay all your debts? Sir, I have twelve mouths to feed at home. - Give him one measure! - Yes! A measure for Yoon-chil! A full measure of golden rice. Then Gan-Nan wants to take two measures! Half the bag is filled with rice husks. Mr. Hwang! The Rickshaw! I have to go to the pastor. There you are! You never came to work and you want to borrow rice? Your debts accumulate and you ask for rice! Of all the nerve! Mr. Hwang, hurry! Here, caramels! Buy my caramels! Rice caramels caramels and jelly beans! There are planes in the sky and trains on the ground. But until now, our forefathers rode on donkeys wearing horsetail hats, reciting poems on fragrant mornings and moon-lit evenings. Is it any wonder we're so backward. Buy my flowers. I'd like a bouquet. Here, caramels! Buy my caramels! Here. Buy my mackerel! Freshly caught in the East Sea! Tasty, salted mackerel... - Morning. - Oh, you're late today. Don't hang about here today. Try over there where the Japanese bar is. There'll be more people and you'll sell more. - But I daren't. - Don't be so shy. You're only selling flowers. Give it a go. I know this business better than you. By the way, can you bring me some herbs tomorrow? They sell well these days. A flower-seller shouldn't stay in one place. Go quickly, in front of the bar. Haven't you finished yet? The guests will all be coming tomorrow and you've hardly started! Even if you have to spend all night, finish it before dawn! Or you'll ruin it, tomorrow's party. Where's Kotpun? She should be helping you at times like this instead of selling flowers! If she earned anything she'd repay your debts! Oh dear! Buy my flowers. I'd like a bouquet. I'd like some roses. Dirty. Buy my flowers These beautiful red flowers My flowers are adorned with tears These beautiful red flowers I've no country I've no money I have no means of support In spring where the buds bloom I sell these flowers adorned with tears You're home? Why are you home so late? You don't look too well. Did something happen? No. Daughter, stop selling your flowers. Must you even repair pots? You poor thing. Even this we must do if we're to eat. Go to bed, I'll do it tomorrow. You don't know how to. You've never repaired a pot. It's not so easy. I'll do it tomorrow. Rest now. It's not true! You're working too hard. You'll kill yourself if you continue like this. It would be better if Kotpun worked in your place. Even you repeat Madame Bae's words? I'd rather die than have her work for them as a slave. I've held out until now so she won't become... their servant. Kotpun, If I die, how could you live alone in this cruel world? Mother, don't say that. We couldn't live without you. I'll sell lots of flowers and buy medicine for you. Soon, you'll be well and brother will return. And we'll all be happy. Kotpun, don't cry. I won't leave you all alone. I won't let you slave for Mr. Bae, I'll fight it with all my strength. Oh, the bitch! You're worth less than an animal! How can you pick up the flour? It's for the banquet. Mum! Listen. If you've earned a little money, you should bring it to Mr. Bae... to pay at least interest. I've no money. Forget my medicine, please. I really don't have any. Sun Hui, stay with Mum today. I'll go buy her medicine. You've got enough money? Yes, almost. With the flowers, I'll pick some herbs as well, today. Sun Hui, isn't your sister selling flowers today? She went to pick some herbs. She can't sell flowers today then. Last night, my sister and me cried over Mum. Really? Young-lan, can you take me to town? To town? Yes. I want to sell flowers and earn money for my sister. To buy medicine for Mum. Want me to come with you? - Please. - Okay. You think we can sell a lot? - I don't know. - I hope we'll sell them all. - Did you hurt yourself? - No. I broke my stick. Doesn't matter. Let's go? Buy my flowers. Buy my flowers. Children, go sell over there. Where the violinist's playing? There are lots of people around him. I've come from the pastor. The pastor likes bacon. Nobody's buying, let's go back. I'm hungry. Aren't you? I'm not hungry. I want to sell at least one. Sun Hui, you can sing, right? Sing a song. A song? People will come and listen. You think? What shall I sing? Your favourite song, that your sister taught you. Sing it with me. I don't know the words. Come on, sing. This is an entertaining novel, "Beauty Under the Moon". And this is called "Vengeance of My Life". Buy my flowers. Sir, buy my flowers. Who taught you this song? - Her sister taught her. - Sister? Her sister went to gather herbs, she's selling them in her place. Okay. Her mother's ill. She sells flowers to buy medicine for her mum. Children, come with me. This isn't a good place. Let's go. Buy my mackerel! You're here already? They are still fresh, these herbs. There're not that many. That's plenty. Come back tomorrow for the basket. - I'll sell them from it. - If you like. Here. - take it. - Is that alright? Yes, I'll give you more when I've sold everything. Come on. Thank you. Goodbye. Buy my anise! They're still fresh! They've just been picked on the mountain! Buy my flowers These lovely red flowers Sing it again! Little beggar, sing again I'll give you a coin! Little blind beggar! Sun Hui! What are you doing here? Why did you come here? Yong Ran brought me. I'm selling flowers for Mum. We're poor, but not beggars. I can handle people's insults, but you mustn't do that. Mother would cry to learn you've humiliated yourself. Can't you understand? If you carry on like this, our brother will never come back. Sister. I was wrong, Sis. Sun Hui. Let's go. Will we really buy the medicine? Of course. - Have you got enough money? - Yes. - I've got enough. - Great! Who are you? Hello, doctor. It's the flower girl. I've come for Mum's medicine. Fine, let's go in. - You have enough money? - Yes. Hello, doctor. Come in, children. Doctor, the Japanese officer has been here looking for ginseng. Sit down. You too. Doctor, we would also like ginseng in our medicine. Wait. This girl has waited a long time to buy medicine for her mother. Bring me all the ginseng. Even if the Japanese insist, I must use some ginseng for her mother. I've brought 3 won as you told me to. I'll prepare 3 packets for the moment. We'll see later, depending on your mother's condition. Thousands of azaleas Beautiful azalea blooms Our devotion to mother blossoms like pretty flowers It blossoms in our hearts Like a pretty bouquet of flowers I prepared each flower With all of my heart My devotion blossoms More beautifully than any flower My devotion blossoms Like a pretty bouquet You still let Kotpun go and sell flowers? You've got a nerve, not sending her to us. What a bunch of ingrates! Mr. Bae is generous, but there's a limit. Ask Mr. Bae to forgive us one last time. I wish I were dead. You have only to pay your debts! I'll have to sort that out. So... If you don't bring us the amount due today, we'll take Kotpun and sell her to a bar, got it? Wait. Please... Mrs. Kim, are you there? Oh God! What's happened to you? Mrs. Kim, wake up! Help me! Is anyone there? Mrs. Kim! - Mrs. Kim! - Kotpun's mother! Big Sis, hurry up. Mum will be waiting. When she's cured and big brother returns, how happy we'll be. Yes, so happy! Mrs. Kim, What's happened to you? Kotpun! Your mother is... Mama! Mama! What happened? Mum! Mum, your medicine! Mum, Big Sis bought your medicine. Mummy! You can't leave us. We've no father or brother. You promised not to leave us. We can't live alone. You can't leave blind Sun Hui! Mummy! The river flows on Never ceasing But my sadness Remains in my heart On this vast earth I have nowhere to go We unfortunate ones Have nowhere to go Kotpun. Let's go. think of your little sister. Sun Hui... Let's go home. Come on. It is said that faith can move mountains. Was Kotpun's faith not sufficient? With the single desire for her mother to get well, she had held out till then, If one scattered all the flowers picked by traversing the mountains and braving the thorn bushes, they would cover the whole village. But her mother has left her without receiving a single flower. Did she not understand the devotion of her daughter? Life is cruel. Why should one suffer so much misfortune? She does not know why there is so much unhappiness in her life. But who could explain? It's been three years since you've heard from him. How can you travel 100 miles looking for your brother? I must know what has happened to him. Before, I thought only of my mother, but now, I think only of him, day and night. I understand. But how can you make this trip without any money. Have we ever had any money? But I'm worried, especially for Sun Hui. Don't worry about her. She'll stay with us, with my Yon Ran. When you get back you'll live with us too. Even if we must starve. I wish I could take her with me on my back. She cannot see our brother, but at least she could hear his voice. It's too far, it would be too hard for you. Well, will you really leave tonight? Yes. Mr. Bae has already told me to come to their house. If he comes back tomorrow, he'll take me by force. take it. It's only one coin, but it's all that I have. Madame... Please sleep beside Sun Hui tonight. If she wakes up, tell her I left for the market. Alright. I'll go home and then come back. And don't tell your children where I've left for. I don't want Sun Hui to know. And if Mr. Bae learns... I understood. Don't leave until I come back. The stars in the sky Now are all asleep Dear little sister Sleep, you too, in peace I must go tonight Leaving you behind Such a long way alone My heart is filled With bitter tears Let the cold rains fall Or the blizzard come The great love I hold for you Will protect you When you hear the breath of the wind That comes from afar Take it for my call As I think of you You there, faster! Are they all prisoners? It seems so. Are you too here to see someone? Yes, but I haven't got the date. What do you mean? You must register and wait for a visit date. How long is your husband's term? Fifteen. My visit, it's in another five days. After tomorrow, I'll be able to see my brother. Why don't they call me? Silence! Otherwise no visit! Come when I call your name! Ri Sun Nyo! Kim Hong-sil! Park Yok-joo! Cha Tan-sil! Park Seung-chol! Kim Seong-geum! In order! Kim Myung-hee! Kim Chi-Sam! Tanaka. Check if she's there. Who's Kotpun? It's me. Kim Chol-Yong is your brother? See if it's him. He's dead, go home! Big Brother! In this cruel, wicked world What should I do? Wherever I go There is only sorrow In miserable plight I am trampled and oppressed Under this dark and heavy sky There's nowhere left for me to go How can I carry on In this cruel and wicked world? I ask everyone But answers, I have none Whenever will I be free? Free from this misery There is no end To my grief and sorrow Tell me, who will pay for this girl? I'm sorry for her, but I can't keep her free of charge. Seeing how she is, I can't believe she has any money. Wait. You can't leave just yet. Not in such a condition. Sir... On the hill Where the cold wind blows The little girl is alone Piteous little child Her sister has left Searching for her brother The girl waits Hot tears scour her face Sun Hui! Sun Hui, where have you been? You're frozen. - Hurry home. - Goodbye. I'm sure something's happened to Kotpun. It's been three months since she left. I'm worried too. We shouldn't have let her go alone. She may no longer be in this world. Sun Hui, don't cry, please. Isn't that the witch of Odong village? Bae's wife fell ill. It seems she suffers from splitting headaches. She'd do better treating me with a tiptop dinner than wasting money on a witch. She'd get well with an awl driven into her noddle. It's because of the evil spirit from the South-east. We must chase away this evil spirit. Or even expensive drugs will be useless. Money and power are useless too. We must drive it away. This evil spirit comes from the South-east. A spirit from the South-east? It must be coming from the village. Big Sister... A spirit from the South-east... It's come to kill me! There's a horned demon come! Right there, the demon! There's no ghost here. A Christian shouldn't believe in ghosts! Rest. I've put amulets everywhere, you'll soon get well. They've come to take me, they come to kill me! Come see. Kotpun's house is located South-east, isn't it? Yes, sir. When did my wife fall ill? Her condition deteriorated when that blind bitch began to cry on the hill. I'm convinced... she's possessed by the spirit of her dead mother. Listen. Get rid of the child to cure my wife. Sun Hui, stop crying. I heard your sister coming. - Is it true, sir? - Of course, I'm sure. But she fell on her way. She is injured and is now staying in town. Young-LAN has gone off to see her. - Please take me there. - Of course. Of course, I have business there anyway. Let's go? Is it much farther? We've just passed the bridge, we'll be there soon. Mummy! Kotpun is here! What? Kotpun here? Has Kotpun returned? Oh, Kotpun, you're finally back! You're finally back! - How you must have suffered. - You're frozen stiff. Kotpun! - Madame! - Here you are at last! You must've had a hard time of it. Grandpa, come quickly! Is it true that Kotpun is back? She's been gone the whole of winter. Sir, don't make so much noise. It's my fault. I didn't take good care of Sun Hui. The whole village has been looking. We've searched everywhere. But we couldn't find her. Sun Hui... I only kept going thinking of you. But you... You too? Sun Hui! Kotpun. You must be strong, otherwise you'll get sick too. Sun Hui must be no more. Those scoundrels must have... That evening I came out hearing her crying. I saw Paek-man, Bae's steward, approach Sun Hui who was crying on the hill. I didn't pay any attention. I never thought such such a thing would happen. I'm sure it's Paek-man who took her. They have the Japanese supporting them. What can we do? I can't see... Sun Hui! Darling... What is it? You... You're Kotpun? Give me back my sister. What? You dare? Give me her now. What did you do to her? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? Chase her away. This instant! Where is everyone? Kotpun! Bitch! Throw her into the river or sell her! Anyway, get rid of her before dawn! Six years ago, one rainy day, Kotpun's brother was arrested by the Japanese and left behind his mother and sisters. Who knows where he has been since then? During his four years in prison, he never forgot his native village. He escaped from prison and rejoined the revolutionaries. During that time, he continued to think of his village. Comrade Chol-Yong. Let's go to your village to see your family on your return. It's not far. We'll visit old friend San. He lives alone in the mountains. But he's a good friend. Are you there? Who is it? It's you! I thought you'd forgotten me. - Come in. - I came with a friend. - Glad to meet you. - Come in. You no longer live alone? Who is that girl? It's an incredible story. I found her in the mountains. She is blind and she never speaks a word. The day before yesterday, I went to check the traps I'd put out to capture the roe deer. Suddenly, I heard a little girl crying. I ran towards her to see who was there. Heavens! Child! I can't see, I can't see you... Like flowers caught by the frost Falling under the weight of snow These poor sisters are forsaken In this lonely land Even the moon in the sky Seems indifferent These poor children! Who can save them? Sun Hui! It's me, your brother. How is this possible? How can there be such cruel people? It's not right. We can't live with them like this. - Come on, let's wipe them out! - Let's go! We'll teach them a lesson! What's more, they locked up Kotpun, they deserve to die! Let's go! Let's save Kotpun! Kotpun! Kotpun! You're alive! Wake up. Your brother, he's back. It's impossible. My brother... died in prison. It's not true. Your brother is alive. And we've found Sun Hui! What? Sun Hui? Chol-Yong! Kotpun is here. Big Brother! Kotpun! Brother, where have you been? Why didn't you come before? Mother so longed for you. You know, brother? I know. But I wasn't even able to offer a bowl of hot soup to her who suffered so much in bringing us up. For you too, life must have been hard. Kotpun! Brother! Where are you, Sis? Sister? Sun Hui! Kotpun, it's not easy for you to understand why we suffer so much. This is because we have no country and the Japanese and people like Bae oppress the people of Korea. Kotpun, this is the tragedy of a stateless nation. The tragedy of this ruined nation. Villagers! To free ourselves from this oppression, we must chase away the Japanese and regain our country. We must build a new world without landlords and capitalists. For these poor children, we must feed their hunger, dress them and give them a decent education. We must all unite and lead the revolution! Now the Korean Revolutionary Army has taken arms to regain the country and prepares the revolution so our people can live in a free world! Support the KRA! Let's support it! Icy is the wind Fierce the frost and snow But the cold cannot stop The blooming flowers of spring Under the benevolent sun shining so brightly The red flowers of revolution Now bloom everywhere In our village streets And in the hearts of our people Lovely flowers now are blooming Blooming everywhere In our beautiful golden land In our beautiful homeland We sow the seeds of revolution That will bloom everywhere Direction: Kim Il Sung Prize Winner and People's Actor Pak Hak Kim Il Sung Prize Winner and People's Artist Choe Ik Gyu Photography: Merited Artists Pak Pyong Su and Ri Hui Son Kotpun: HONG Young-hee Sun Hui: PARK Hwa-seon Orchestra Ryongyang Ribada (Winner of the KIM IL-SUNG Order) Literary group of Baekdusan (Winner of the Medal KIM IL-SUNG Order) Korean Film Studio (Winner of the Medal KIM IL-SUNG Order)
