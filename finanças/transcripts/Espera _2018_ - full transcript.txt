WAITING Those images were kept for many years resting at 10 Celsius in my fridge. I did not have a clue of what was kept on those rolls. For a long time, as I opened the fridge to look for something to eat, I would run into that pile of yellow boxes from Kodak. Those images, perhaps the only witnesses of something I had lived, were waiting to be seen. It's all in there. Three minutes of someone's life. Ex-po-sed. Is that right? - Exposed. - Yeah. This one, do you think it's gonna work? Man, I don't know. This one is a 7078. - The 7266... - It's also a Tri-X. It might work. Let's try. We can search on the internet. Yes, maybe the chemical is the same and it will work. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You took the film, right, Leo? Let's go. All right, let's close it. And turn off the light.

Ouch! Well... My name is... My name is Gael Benitez, I'm 20 years old. Today is November 25th, 2015. It was my first day of "T"... And... That's it! This is my transition. So... What I have to say is that... My butt hurts, a little bit. But I thought it was going to hurt more. It's alright. And... Well... I'm crazy to see the changes soon. I think it's going to take a little long. 'Cause the testosterone I'm taking is Nebido, and it takes a little longer to take effect. It must start around the second month, or third month, really big changes, that are going to be more evident. But, I'm happy to have started, finally. After a long time of waiting, of a lot of anxiety, of many nights not sleeping, a lot of tears and... and everything else. It was a difficult wait. But I got started and now it's all about waiting for the results. Meanwhile, I daydream. Waiting is the ideal condition for daydreaming. A world that doesn't wait doesn't have delusions, doesn't dream. SLEEP CLINIC So... Today is December 24th, 2015. So it's been a month since I have started taking testosterone. It's my first month of testosterone. I... I kinda gave up on waiting for the changes. I reckon that as time passes, the more it seems... that nothing happens. ♪ Hindu that lays in heaven Is the king ♪ Tightly waiting Here we are, oh Lord ♪ Bring upon us the chain of love ♪ With your entities The Old Black workers ♪ Oh Indian messenger ♪ Come upon us Come upon us ♪ Come raise our Aruanda ♪ He came from God He has arrived ♪ He has arrived The Hindu King ♪ He has arrived ♪ He has arrived. - Then you put the hose over there. - Okay. The other one we used to have is over. The small bottle gets cold faster than the big one. Let's... see if it worked. It is the moment of truth. Here in the middle... These ones are fine. It seems here is kinda dirty. Here is good. Here is so-so. Put it here please. Sorry? Okay, now just wait for it to dry and screen it. There are some cool images. What about this girl, she seems to be from another time, so remote... This haircut, this lace collar. Where did you come from? From what time? I don't recognize nothing or no one in these images. Not even this cigarette smoke that I always liked to film, it's not mine... As those crazy tilts are also not mine, on that window that I can't recognize. During all these years did I keep another one's memories? Zé Bento, old fella! These images are yours! These windows of Bonfim neighborhood, this Marlboro on whatever ashtray... The broken mirror betrayed you. To me it betrayed my memory. I'm sorry. I was born devious. We are all devious. To live, to fight and to make mistakes. To be wrong, to be wrong, to be wrong... To be wrong, to be wrong, to be wrong... This is bad, this is not bad. This is not bad, this is bad. The question is... Faith and love. And art as an appetizer. Passion and love... will never be represented by any machine. It's a shame... A microwave... Why isn't a microwave a son of God? Fuck. The entity of God is a fuck up, my friends. It's not easy. It's really interesting for us to... To think... Wait for the chance to... This negotiation between faith and reason. The opposite of laziness is business. 12.8 currently... is the limit for hypertension. It means that everyone is tense. Kevin Spacey is even more. Everything can be simulated. And all those questions shake our lives up. The power of banality and the power of relevance. Today I shaved my beard for the first time after I started taking testosterone. And it was interesting because... it was not just about shaving. It was more than that. It was like if... If I was... I was feeling and seeing the real thing. As if... It was a... As if it was the materialization of a possible future. That is not impossible anymore, right? It's already something. As if it became a tangible thing. And what I was seeing there was a possible reality, and before I couldn't see as a possibility. Dear passengers, your attention please. It's 1:25am. Five minutes left for next departure. Go downstairs and turn left, then you look for the bank, go upstairs and make the payment. Then they you will call you again to make your ID. Okay. Thank you. - Is it your second way? - Yes. - Did your last ID have a CPF number? - Yes, it did. - Your color... - Sorry? How do you declare your color? White. - Incomplete graduation? - That's right. - Single, student? - Yes. - Is anything wrong? - No, it isn't. Actually it is because... 'Cause... Uh? - So is everything okay? - Just like your birth certificate. We make it according to your birth certificate. I see. Excuse me. I'm going to take a look to see if there are any loose wires. - Are there? - No. But I'm going to stick some more. It isn't loose, but I'm going to put one more to... This one, what is it for? Is there anything coming out from here? No. What is it for? For breathing. - Ah, just to measure. - Yep. - I thought some air would come out. - No, not on this one. - Good night. - Good night. - Have nice dreams. - Thanks. The color rolls still need to be processed. I headed to Buenos Aires on a boat from Montevideo, where I was told I could find a Super 8 Lab that develops color film. I didn't have the faintest idea of what those film cartridges kept. The trip lasted for three hours. When I left it was a rainy morning and I arrived in sunny warm weather. The people on that boat seemed relaxed. To be waiting surrounded by water is necessarily different from waiting on the asphalt or in the air. Sometimes, the longer we wait, the more we forget what we were waiting for. And what we wait for turns out to be less important than simply waiting. The knitting, the crossword and the sleep, recurring tasks among those who wait, got another texture there, a certain depth of field, as founded in the super 8 images stored in my bag. Gliding along the mouth of the Rio de la Plata provoked a kind of dilation in time and space. I always liked filming windows. Unlike the oval shaped windows of an airplane, the boat windows remind me of cinema. As I wait, I daydream again. And I follow closely a monotonous three hour movie. At some point I no longer realize what I'm watching. A minimal detail of the landscape framed by the windows of this boat reminds me of other windows, of different boats from where I once looked. The same ones I carry with me in my bag now. Film, retina, emulsion, epidermis. The image is a mere surface. Our look erodes it like an acid. Our look hurts it, penetrates it and gives it depth. Those images left their resting state, their frosty inexistence. They no longer wait for a look. Now we are the ones looking at them. We are the ones who wait. We, spectators, what do we wait for?
