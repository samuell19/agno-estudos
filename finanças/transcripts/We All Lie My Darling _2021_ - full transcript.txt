I'm gonna be late. - Aww, kissing cups. Uh, excuse me. Are we forgetting something? - What? (Kat humming) - Oh my god. You're so needy. Come here. Muah, see you guys later. - See ya. - Bye. Yeah, no. No more chocolate chip cookies for breakfast. Have pears. (door creaking) You know what? You take that. Eat fruit. I'll take this. And, no, that was disgusting. No, can you empty that out and clean it for me? - Yeah. - Good luck finding a job. - Thanks. (birds chirping) (door creaking) Kissin' cups. (birds cooing) (sighs) - No. No. No. (crunches) No. Nope.

(both chuckling) How'd you like a weekend away just you and me? - I would like that a lot. - Where would you like to go? - Somewhere hot and a bit tropical. Brisbane? - Oh, what's in Brisbane? - Well we could go to the Gold Coast. We could go swimming. We could go skinny dipping. - But. But Melbourne might be colder. We could practice keeping each other warm. Yeah, Melbourne would be perfect. - (chuckles) Yeah, would it? - Yeah. - Why's that? - Well the coffee's infinitely better and there's a lot more culture. We can go to an art exhibit, maybe a theater show... musical... - You'd like that? - Yeah, especially if you're there. - That wasn't good enough. I can't wait to go to Brisbane with you. Oh. (chuckles) - Damn. Somebody is lookin' good tonight, kitty Kat. - Just goin' for a drink with a friend. - Right, friend. Kat, babe? - Yeah? - You know I've got your back, right? - Yeah. Why, what's up? - I dunno. Do you ever feel like you're wasting your energy with these guys that keep you on speed dial to distract them from their miserable mundane lives? - Um. No, mom. But thanks? - (scoffs) Well maybe I'm the only one that cares enough to have this conversation with you. - I mean I get it. I know I've been a little lost lately. I'm just... trying to figure stuff out. I know it's easier for you. You've got this. You've got yourself sorted. - Kat, you've got a job here as long as you want it. - Thank you. - I just think that it's really important that you start at least thinking about who you wanna be and where you wanna be. I hate seein' you get hurt. - I'm tryin' to figure it out. Thanks for looking out for me. But I should go. Don't wanna be late. - You look beautiful. Have fun tonight, even if it is just a bit of fun. - Who knows? He could be Prince Charming. Don't wait up. - Hey, did you even clock-off? (crow cawing) - We're closing in 20 minute huh. - Yeah. Okay, that's fine. (silverware rattling) Already? - Yes. They like to get ready really early to have the Christmas set up before everyone. I even have a playlist. I'll show you. You're gonna love it.

Maybe I wanna know why you're seeing him again. You said you wouldn't. You lied to us. - As I recall, someone once told me and you may remember who said this. "We all lie my Darling." - Nope, that was different. - What? I don't see how. So you mean to tell me that you have never done one slight thing that has been unscrupulous, Mr. Self-righteous? - I haven't lied about it. - Hate to break it to you, Sammy, but you ain't no choirboy. - Oh. Does that mean my choirboy career is over? (Kat chuckling softly) What will I do? I'm serious though. You know, you're a big girl and you can make up your own mind. But I just think you deserve someone better than that. Somebody who doesn't want you on the side but all the time. Someone who's worth all of your heart and has a nice dick. Not just big, but clean. (Kat chuckling) - Clean would be nice. Yeah, okay. I thought we were having a moment. I was wrong, very wrong. - I love you kitty Kat - Yeah, I love me too. (Kat chuckling) (city trains, bus & trams noises) - Oh shit. Sam. - It's not good news, is it? - It could be better. - It's all right, honestly. Just tell me. - Okay. So your test did come back positive. You're HIV-positive. Do you understand what that means? - Yeah. Yeah, I understand. - Listen, HIV is such a manageable disease these days. People live with it every single day, Sam. There's medications that suppress the virus. There's support groups. I can give you the brochure. - What about Paul? Is he all right? - I mean it's really good that you guys had protected sex before you got tested. - Honey, you're gonna be okay. (soft somber music) - Hey Nicky. - Hey kitty Kat. - So you've been looking a little under the weather lately. I got you some multivitamins. Take them, okay? - Yeah, okay. Hey, Kat? - Mmm? What's up? - I'm not sure if Sam's okay or not. - What do you mean? - Well he's been in his room all day and he hasn't come out. - Weird. Okay, I'll go check. (knocks) Sam, it's Kat. (knocks) Hello? Sam, I'm coming in, okay? What's wrong? Sammy, you can tell me. Whatever it is, it might be better to talk about it. Sammy. - Just went to see Blake. - What'd she say? - I've got HIV. (soft somber music) - Blake would've told you about the medication, right? This is not a death sentence, 'kay? This is something that you live with now, not something that kills you. - Who's gonna want me? - All of your family and friends who love you. That's not going to change. Sam, anyone who really loves you is always going to love you. You're kinda stuck with us now. - Think Paul's gonna leave. - If he goes, he goes. Okay? You guys have only been dating two months. This is his chance to show you his colors and... lay his hand and all those other metaphors you're so much better at than me. The right person will love you no matter what. Hey, what would Shakespeare say? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. - "To be or not to be". - "To be". Always. (buzzer buzzing) Paul? - Yeah. - We'll leave you the house to yourselves, okay? And if you need me, you just call, okay? I love you, Sammy. - All right, I will let you make the rest of your Tinder decisions on your own. - Thank you. - So how you been, Nicky? - Good. Yeah, I'm lovin' Sydney. Thank you again for you know, letting me stay. I feel like I'm a burden. - Stop saying thank you. You are family. You're staying with us permanently. You know that, right? - Oh yeah, plan to. - (chuckles) Good. Squatter's rights. - Oh yeah. - So how long have you and Blake been, you know? (whistles) - Oh, we're just friends. You know, we get drunk and we hook up sometimes but that's it. - Yeah, yeah. I just think Blake might consider you just a bit more than a friend. - Bullshit. - Mm-mmm. Pretty soon I think you're gonna find out either way. (lips smooching) - Oh, you know what? You're so full of it. (Nick shouting) - Blake, Blake. Help, help, help. - Stop being so- - Oh my god, I can't leave you guys alone for like two minutes. You're already pinching his nipples. Nick, you were so calm and mature about Sam's news tonight. I'm really proud of you. - Thanks. - I wanted to let you know. Also there's a job opening at ACON and I think you should take it. I'll put in a good word for you. Don't worry. - Cool. Thank you. - [Blake] Yeah, no problem. - Congratulations, Nicky. All right, celebrating Nicky's- - Cheers. - New job. - You got an umbrella. - Cheers. - But tomorrow you get to wake up - Whoa, guys. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Oh god. - That doesn't look good. 'Kay, maybe you should go in first and we'll follow later. - Yeah. Okay, come in in like 10 minutes? (lock clicking) (water trickling) (keys jingling) (soft poignant music) - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sam. Sam, honey. Sam, honey. (Sam weeping) Hey. Hey. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. You hear me? We're all here for you. (Sam weeping) All of us, it's okay. (crickets chirping) (soft poignant music) - I had this almond biscuit the other day and it just like gave me this flashback of how my grandma used to make me biscuits. But then she used to be like really passive aggressive about it and make me feel guilty and say like you know, I owe her for making these biscuits for me. She used to lay on the guilt like so thick. And even though she only died like three months ago, now my mom has taken over this role in my life and it's just like (sighs) confusing, I guess. But apart from that, like everything in my life is going pretty well. Like I just moved into a new place and I'm getting more shifts at work. But it's just like, you know. - Yeah, no. No, I don't. - (sobs) Nobody wants to date me. I don't know why. - Yeah, I know why. - What? - Nothing, honey. Here have a tissue. (patient sobbing) (nose blowing) You know, I think we should probably book another appointment for next week but maybe with someone else. - What? - Yeah. - Well hello. - Hi. - You're one of the best-lookin' things I've seen in awhile. - Thanks. Thanks, I guess. - No worries, man. - Did you wanna book an appointment with one of the counselors? - I've already got one. - Because of the HI..? - No, my parents have been doin' some fucking intervention exorcism bullshit and I've been surrounded by priests and reprogrammers for days. - Heavy. - You said it. Not from Sydney, eh? - Wollongong. - Okay. Can I have your phone? What? You don't want my number? - No. Yes. Yes. Hold on. There you go. - Call me. - (clears throat) Hey Nicky. So originally, I was coming over here to make sure you were okay. But I just saw what happened. Yeah and I think you're just fine. His name's Nathan.

You didn't think that was like stupid? - I mean it made me feel good. I'm okay, aren't I? - Do you wanna lose your job? - No. - Well if you keep doing crap like this, you're gonna lose your job. Is it worth it? I don't wanna look at you anymore. Can you leave me alone please? I wanna finish this.

(soft somber music) And if you wanna lie, that's fine lie. We all do. If you wanna be the absolute best at what you do, then do that too. It's your choice and it's up to you to live, honey, to really live. And there is nothing more exhilarating than that. - Oi, bitch. Look who I found spying on you. - Good evening. - Nicky, let me introduce you to the most amazing woman on the planet: my mom. - Hi Nick. - Hi. - Lovely to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Hi honey. - Why didn't you tell me you got back from holidays so soon? - I wanted to surprise you. - I love you, mom. - I love you too, sweetheart. Talk to me. What's up, sweetheart? You okay? - I'll be okay. - I love you so much and I am so proud of you. I see how professional your shows are. I look at how far you come. You're beautiful, darling. You're absolutely fabulous. I love you, darling. Hang on. Is that my dress? (soft guitar music) (birds chirping) - You seeing anyone? - No, not really. - When you and Kat gonna get it together? - I don't know. I don't know if it's her thing. I really don't. - I think it is. I mean but what do I know? (both chuckling) I sit out here. I see everything. - That's why I'm here. - I've been workin' on a song for you. - You have? - Yeah, you wanna hear it? - Yeah, I wanna hear it. Let's hear it. Yay.

Not an excuse, but yeah. - Well don't you feel us? (soft somber music) - You know, it's hard to explain to you because you don't understand. You know exactly who you are and you know what you want and you have this amazing support system back home. I don't have any of that. And with Chris. With Chris, I know the deal, all right? There are no surprises. You know that this has absolutely nothing to do with you, right? This is all me trying to figure everything out. - Yeah. Okay. (basketball thudding) - So how're you doin' with it all? - Oh, with the group you mean? - That and other stuff. - I know I didn't respond too well at first. - I know that feeling. - Yeah? - Yeah. My sister, she's HIV positive. She still had two kids and had a great family. What are you thinking? - Sorta thinking about it in a different way. Like I can imagine a different world with it. I mean not bad, just different. - Takes people a long time to get to that point. - I don't wanna lie to myself. - That, mister, is a plan. Let's go again. (buzzer buzzing) - (squeals) Oh my god.

Babe, you didn't say you had a household full of good-looking people. - [Blake] Mm-hmm. - I like her. - So nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - And I heard so much about you two. - All lies. - I don't think so. So you guys together? - [Blake] Gabby! - What? - And he's taken the news so well. I'm so proud of him. - I'm so proud of you. - Why? - Because you just had to tell your best friend. I mean you're the strong one. You've always been the strong one. You know, babe. I didn't come back just to see my family. I've come back because I want you to come back with me. (patrons chattering) (plates clattering) - I don't wanna talk about that. - Okay, but you're coming to LA for the holidays, right? - Yeah, to visit my family. - So we can talk about it then. Oh yes, I'll get that. - God, Gabby. Some things never change. (chuckles) I like the new do. - Why thank you. - I don't even know why did we break up again? - Well we were young and scared, I guess. It's you know, just one of those things. - What kinda things? - The kinda thing where (sighs) you know, it just wasn't moving forward and you know, we went in different directions. We just got off the bus. - Got off the bus? - Babe, you know what I mean. It just stopped and, you know, we wanted different things. - Yeah. I did a really big thing and I moved here. - But you didn't have to. - Yes, I did. - Why? - Space and time. I had to find myself again. I had to be away from you, Gabby. (soft somber music) - Babe. I miss you. You know, LA isn't home without you. I want you to come back with me. - I know. - Come on. (patrons chattering) - Guys, our last get together before Blake goes on holiday tomorrow. - Cheers. (glasses clinking) - Hey Sam. - Hey. - Good to see you. - How are you? (patrons chattering) - Blake, you need to sing a song. Sing us a song, Blake. Your last song please. - Yes, c'mon. - One more song. Everybody, Blake's gonna sing a song. - Yeah. - Yup, here we go.
