(eerie music) (dramatic music) (tense music) - We continue to hear modulated hydrogen frequency signal of 21 centimeters, Princess. - What does that mean? - We're not quite certain, Princess. But it is definitely the same signal we have been following since we left our planet. The source of the signals is the planet that we are observing on the telescanner now. These transmissions indicate some intelligent life. - [Princess Marcuzan] Let us move in for a closer look. - [Dr. Nadir] The spectrographic probe indicates that the atmosphere is suitable to sustain us. - [Princess Marcuzan] Prepare for a landing. We will see. Instruct the landing party to wear pressure suits and breathing apparatus. - [Dr. Nadir] Ah-ha! They have launched a missile attack. It may be aimed at us. (ship booming) [Princess Marcuzan] Destroy the missile, Nadir. (Nadir laughs) - Yes, Princess. Focus full force field at 090 degrees, range 700. (machines whirring) And now maximum energy. (machines whirring) (explosion booming) (Nadir laughing) (upbeat music) - What do we do if this guy fouls up today, Professor Steele? - General, we've checked everything out. I'm absolutely confident that nothing can go wrong. - I hope so. Well, we'll have to try it your way. We've already lost three boosters in a row. How are you doing, Miss Grant? (upbeat music) How much longer before we reach the Space Center, Sergeant? - [Sergeant] About five minutes, sir. - They're going to be late with the story but the latest word is that there's going to be a new man. I'm hanging up. They just walked in. General sir, is it true that we heard there's going to be a new man chosen? - Take your seats, gentlemen. Take your seats. Gentlemen, please take your seats and the press conference will begin. Thank you, thank you. Gentlemen, we've just returned from our last meeting with our science advisors and I'm happy to report that the launch is ready to go on schedule. The countdown will begin at 08:00 tomorrow. And now gentlemen, I want to introduce the astronaut chosen for this mission. Colonel Frank Saunders. Colonel Saunders will answer any questions that you might have. Frank. - Doctor Steele is an optimist. What he means is I'll try to answer your questions. - Colonel, aren't you just a little concerned about making a trip of 49 million miles alone? And when you do get to Mars, do you still expect to be alone or do you expect to find other life? - I'm completely trained and ready for this mission. I'm not concerned. Now fear is either physiological or the result of ignorance and superstition. I'm in good physical condition, and I haven't had the time to get superstitious. On the basis of all available data, it would be impossible to determined conclusively whether or not there is life on Mars. That's one of the things I expect to find out. - Colonel, we understand that the radio telescope located on the down range island complex has been receiving signals in answer to their transmissions which may be from either another civilization or from a space vehicle itself. - These signals could come from several sources. There's been no official agreement as to their origin nor has there been anything to prove that they were sent by other intelligent beings. - Colonel, how did you get picked for this project? Aren't there more experienced astronauts available? - My career in the military prior to this mission was in test flight operations. Now as I understand it, all the data on available test pilots was fed into a computer and the results seem to indicate that I am the most likely candidate. Of course, I'm proud and happy to have been chosen but I make it a rule never to question the decisions of my superiors. - Colonel, I've been covering the Space Program for quite a long time yet prior to today I never even heard of you. How do you explain that? - I guess I'm the shy type. (journalist laughs) (tense music) - Colonel? Colonel? - Gentlemen, the colonel wasn't kidding. He really is shy. Well, it's been a long day and we're all rather tired, so. - Gentlemen, gentlemen, this press conference is concluded. Let's all clear the room now. Drinks at the officer's club are on me. - That's a good idea, sir. - Plenty of planes there too. - Prepare for examination. Gloves. Quickly. (tense music) (buzzing) Karen, get me the silica gel. I'm afraid we've still got a problem with the humidity in this atmosphere. - Doctor Steele, I've been against this project from the beginning. - I know you have and I know that you are not alone. - You have friends in high places and science is supposed to have all the answers but this has gotta work. If it fails, I assure you you won't have any friends and I'm not gonna take a fall. - It's not going to fail. Not after we've come this far. We have here, for all practical purposes, a normal human being created out of normal parts transplanted except for his synthetic skin and the electronic sensory control system of course. But the significant factor here is that we can control him with this simple mechanism. His brain can record the data that we need and transmit it to us. - He's a remarkable creation all right. But I don't understand why. We have plenty of men, good men, who are willing to risk their lives in space exploration. - Exactly. Risk their lives. Well why risk one? We can learn all we need to know about extended space travel without the loss of a solitary life. That's the whole point, General. Besides that, we don't have to contend with the possibility of human error. - That's fine, Steele. Well what if the machine breaks? Or something goes wrong with his brain?

Minus 40. - [Man] Status check, pressure is a go. Rockets tanking? - [Man] Not a blinking high level light. You are a go. Water systems, go. Raindrop partitions. Go.

Let's hope your creation doesn't fall apart. - Still got a few miles to go, General. - The Earth ship has just been launched and is headed directly toward our sector. - Do you suppose that they have seen us at this altitude Dr. Nadir? - The probability is low, Princess. We have kept our anti-radar detection at full force. - Let us not take any chances. Commence attack plan on the Earth ship. - Yes, Princess. Focus full force field at 090 degrees, range 700. - We did it, Adam. We've proven again that science and the military can accomplish the impossible. - [Reporter] A hearty breakfast of steak and eggs. (tense music) - And now maximum energy. (machines whirring) - [Reporter] There seems to be something wrong here. We have lost the picture portion of our program. - This is General Bowers, what's going on? Well clear all frequencies from further traffic. - [Reporter] A word now from rocket control center. Yes, Colonel? - Mayflower Two, Mayflower Two, this is General Bowers, over. - [Frank] This is Mayflower two. Malfunction in all electrical systems. Request permission to abort. Rocket out of control. All systems no go. I repeat, all systems no go. (static buzzing) (Nadir laughing) - Use emergency escape equipment, over. Mayflower Two, Mayflower Two. (dramatic music) - The Earth ship pilot has ejected. - Pilot? There are pilots on their missiles? You fool. That obviously was not a missile, but a spaceship. If they have sighted us, all of our plans will be endangered. - [Dr. Nadir] We have lost him. - Find him. Find him and destroy. - We must land immediately. Stations for landing. (dramatic music) Fire retrorockets. (rockets blaring) Activate pressure equalizer. Landing pods down. (machines whirring) (gun bangs) (alien weapon zapping) (explosion booming) (tense music) (wind howling) (alien weapon zapping) (explosion booming) (grunting) (dramatic music) The electronic sensor indicates the patrolmen in the vicinity. They should return momentarily. Shall I initiate preliminary pretakeoff procedures? - Wait until they return. Then we will initiate takeoff procedures and proceed with the optimum pollinization study as scheduled. - Very well, Princess. I'll notify the crew. If we resume operations today, we will not have lost much time. (footsteps approaching) - What has happened here? - We found him in this condition, your highness. There was no sign of the fugitive astronaut. We returned immediately with our comrade to receive further orders. - He seems alive. - He is alive, your highness, but badly wounded. He will require immediate treatment. - Is he able to talk? We must know if he is able to talk. We must know if the fugitive has escaped. - He is unconscious. But from what he told us, it would seem that the fugitive was badly wounded and has little chance of escape. - If he was so badly wounded, how could he have attacked our patrolman? Did you search the area? Did you see anyone? Was there no sign of life anywhere? - Enough, Nadir. This is a clear case of failure. If the fugitive was able to inflict such damage on the patrol, he may be capable of escape. - But that can ruin our plans. We cannot complete phase one of our survey or any part of our plans if we are detected. - This is absurd. After all the reconnaissance work we have completed without successful detection, now to be forced into this position. In the past we have always dealt with intruders easily. But now so close to success to have this happen. - What are your orders, Princess? Shall we call in the rest of the patrols and take off? - We cannot. We must commence phase two immediately. - But we have not completed the survey yet. What if this area does not prove-- - We have no choice. I will talk to our men on the communicator. - May we take this man in for treatment now, Princess? - No. We will make an example of him. There can be no more failures. Bring him to Mull.

At least until the radiation level decreases. You can consider yourselves fortunate to have been chosen for this crew. In case you don't know how fortunate you are, I will let Dr. Nadir tell you what is happening to those left behind. - The lucky ones are dead. Of the others, some will go mad. The others will slowly rot away and die in gradual agony. We have won the war. We are the sole survivors. It belongs to us. But it means that we are extinct as a race unless, of course, we can find some good breeding stock and repopulate our planet. - We have won the war but we have no women. We have come here to this planet for one purpose only. To acquire breeding stock to repopulate our planet. We have been placed in danger of detection by the recent failure of one of our patrols and as a consequence, we must immediately begin phase two of our plan. Capture of the Earth women. (wind howling) (electronic beeping) - There it is again. - We've lost him. - Sorry. - I don't know why we're doing all this. - Well, it could be him. He could be out there somewhere, wandering around hurt. - You mean defective, inoperative. - I know he's not human but he's capable of experiencing pain. He could be suffering. - What we've been picking up could be normal electronic interference from any number of possible sources. - Our last contact was at liftoff plus 202. At that point, it'd already been traveling 1,500 miles. None of the down range pickup ships or island stations have reported any contact. The odds are a million to one you'll never see your boy again. Let's all get some sleep so we can write a good report in the morning. - What if everything except the energy level, all the data communication, all the electronic memory were destroyed? - Well then he'd be a blank. An astro-robot without a control system. Oh, he could feel and experience things but he wouldn't know anything. (tense music) His instinct would be to try to connect with his master control. Of course, we don't know how much damage has been done to the physical machinery but he wouldn't know where to go. He might wander for days, mobile but aimless. - What will he do? - I don't know. It would depend on what had happened to him. If he'd had any bad experiences, he might react violently out of his built in self-preservation unit. Anything could happen. - What you're saying is that he could turn into a Frankenstein. (dramatic music) (man screaming) (phone rings) - General Bowers. - Bowers, our missing astronaut. - Is there a positive identification? - [Man] A murder about an hour ago. - Let me know when anything more comes in. - [Man] A plane will be waiting for you. - Right. They found the capsule in Porto Rico. There was no one in it. They've also gotten reports that there was some violence in the area by someone who they said was wearing something that looked like a spacesuit. - Those signals must be Frank after all. But what are those reports of violence? - Just a moment. The reports were incomplete. We'll have more details when we get to the airport. We're leaving for San Juan tonight. (plane engine roaring) (upbeat music) (alien weapon zapping) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (plane engine roaring) (tense music) (sirens wailing) (woman screaming) (Princess claps hands) - Yes Princess? - Bring the captive girl in. I want to inspect her myself. - Yes Princess. - I understand that this is a good specimen, Nadir. I hope so. We have no more time for failures. - I saw her myself. I feel you will be pleased, Princess. - Come toward me. Now move back. Turn around. Raise your arms to your side. Now over your head. Now lower your arms. Very good. We have done well, Nadir. - I am pleased, Princess, you are satisfied. - I will be satisfied when we have enough more like her to commence phase three. Place all available men into this operation commencing at 18:00 hours. (machine whirring) (sirens wailing) - As you remember, we found the car in the trees, parked, apparently unmolested. The picnickers were over here. But the most interesting thing we found was over here. - Doctor Steele, I'd like you to explain this to me. - It's like the sort of specimens we picked up around Los Alamos. - May I use your radio to call headquarters? I wanna advise defense to take this matter under our sole supervision. - It is radioactive. But Adam, what is it? - Well it was sand. Now it's glass fused together by some concentrated heat. But what I can't understand is what that has to do with Frank. - It couldn't have anything to do with Frank, Adam. (dramatic music) - Elizabeth. (tense music) - I have a hunch we're going to find him somewhere down here. - We'll have the situation under control soon. We've spotted that creation of yours. If he gives us any trouble, we'll bring you back the pieces. - Adam, Frank has become so real to me that I can't bear the thought of his being hurt. Please, let's just get started. - Karen, nobody's going to destroy 10 years of my life's work. Hop on.

(Karen screams) Frank! - Frank, Frank, can you hear me? Frank, can you hear me? Frank, put your hands down. Down, hands down, Frank. - Down. - That's right. That's right, Frank. Atta boy. Okay. Put him down. Put him down gently. - It's horrible, Adam. - Looks worse than it is. Remember, he's a robot, not a man, Karen. - I know. This is the wrong place. I'm sorry. - Thank you. You'd better get started back before it gets dark. I'll stay here and try to finish repairing Frank.

(Karen crying) Please! Please let me go! Please! Please! Please let me go! Please! Please! Let me go. - Everything under control, Nadir? - Our electronic purification is going smoothly and our inspection has revealed no problems thus far. Yes? - We found this device on one of the captives. (dramatic music) - Bring her to me at once! This is a very advanced looking mechanism for this society. What is this device? What is your purpose here? - We have no time. You must answer. I warn you. Very well. I will force you to talk. Nadir, put her in the cage next to Mull. You have only a very few minutes to decide, my dear. (woman screams) (dramatic music) (Mull growling) (Karen screaming) (phone rings) - General Bowers. - General, we just received a TWX from Washington. - What's that? - Alert all local forces, Porto Rico for operation area San Juan. They're asking us for full military support because-- - Oh no, no, no, no. I don't buy that, Colonel. Sounds like a ordinary brush fire action to me. - There are reports of gunfire and unusual civilians. - Probably Castro and that bunch. - Eight missing persons. All women, it says here. At least three casualties, General. Also, radioactive materials found. And this is Code 24, General. Code 24. - All right. I'll have all forces in action immediately. This is General Bowers speaking. Get me CINCLANTFLT. - [Man] Alert all forces. San Juan, Porto Rico. Code emergency. Code emergency. (dramatic music) (exciting music) (tense music) - We just can't wait for Karen. Careful. Now don't try to talk anymore. Just be quiet and follow me. Karen shouldn't be very far. This way. She should've been here. This looks as she hasn't been. Now don't look back, Frank. We're safe. I wonder where Karen is now. (plane engine roaring) (device beeping) (machine whirring) (woman screams) (woman screams) (plane engine roaring) - [Pilot] There's nothing unusual down there, eh? - I think she's had enough, Princess. Let me see if she has any other Earth devices in her satchel. (electronic beeping) - Quiet, quiet, quiet, Frank, quiet. Quiet, quiet, Frank, quiet. They'll hear you. Now Frank, the men who attacked you were from outer space. That's the spaceship that they came here in. That's why Karen didn't get back to the cave. Now look, I think they've got Karen prisoner on that spaceship and you've got to stay here and keep watch over things until I get help from General Bowers. Can you do that Frank? All right. Good luck, Frank. (upbeat music) Hey, you've got a telephone? (man speaks foreign language) No, no, no, no. A telephone. Telephone. Hello, hello. A telephone, telephone. El telephone-o. Thank you. (phone rings) - 33rd commo detachment. Lieutenant Denny speaking. - Listen, I've got to get word immediate to General Bowers. - No, it can't be done, sir. - Why? - Because General Bowers is out on project Mayflower. - I know that. That's exactly why I've got to get this message to him. Now look, you tell him that Doctor Adam Steele is reporting that he has sighted a spaceship two miles northeast of coordinates D1 and 18. - I don't know, sir. I don't know whether I can relay a message like that or not. Nobody would believe it. - You will have to believe me. I know that it sounds fantastic. Spaceship. I repeat, spaceship. - All right sir, if you insist, I'll relay the message to him. - [Adam] Hurry. - Yes, sir. Bird Dog One, Bird Dog One, this is Commo Three, over. - [Pilot] This is Bird Dog One, over. - Bird Dog One, I have an urgent message from Adam Steele for General Bowers. Priority one, over. - [Pilot] Bird Dog One to Commo Three. What is your message, over? - Adam Steele says he has found a spaceship. - [Pilot] Spaceship? That's the message? - That's right, a spaceship, at coordinates D118. - [Pilot] Well, he's right below me. I'll relay the message, over now. This is Bird Dog One calling Red Hook. Urgent message for General Bowers from Adam Steele. Do you read me? - [General Bowers] Turn this Jeep around. Red Hook to base, Red Hook to base. Scramble the jets. - [Man] Scramble all jets. Scramble all jets. (upbeat music) (plane engines roaring) - [Pilot] This is Rebel High leader. We'll approach our objective with full offensive strength. (dramatic music) - Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank, it's me. Frank. It's all right, it's me. - [Pilot] This is Rebel High Three. I am nearing the objective. Minus two miles. Calling Red Hook for instructions. - Rebel High, Rebel High, this is Red Hook. Go ahead. - [Pilot] I've sighted the objective. - Is there anyone near the ship? - [Pilot] Negative. There was activity but the area's clear now. - Very well. Try a rocket barrage and report results immediately. (dramatic music) (explosions booming) - [Pilots] Our rockets just aren't working. - Frank. Frank. - With these weapons, they cannot do any damage to our ship. - We must take off immediately. They have nuclear weapons and if they use them, we are finished. - When shall we go, Nadir? - We must leave immediately. - Frank, free the other women first. They're in there, hurry. (women chattering) - [General Bowers] Captain, what were the results of the last strike? - General Bowers, you're not trying to destroy that spaceship. - [General Bowers] What do you mean? - I'm absolutely convinced that Karen and at least two other women are aboard that spaceship. General, you've gotta stop that attack immediately. - Captain, get Rebel High and tell him to cease fire immediately. - [Captain] Rebel High, your orders are to cease fire. Stop the attack. (plane engine roaring) - [Soldier] Cease fire, cease fire. (dramatic music) - The switch, right there. (Mull growling) (Karen screams) (alien weapon zapping) (explosion booming) - [Dr. Nadir] Pressure pulse. Igniters. - Adam! Oh, Adam! Adam! - [Dr. Nadir] Rockets ignite! (rockets booming) Full power!
