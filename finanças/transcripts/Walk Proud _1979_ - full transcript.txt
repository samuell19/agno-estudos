So, who's gonna help him if we don't? We're his brothers, man. We're Chicanos! If somethin' like that happened in Marina del Rey, the cops would be there In a minute. Right. Excuse me, sir. I beg your pardon, sir, did someone throw a bomb in your bed, sir? Don't worry, we'll bust him. We'll send him straight to jail. But Venice ain't the Marina. So what do you wanna do, Cesar? I wanna show them. We call ourselves Los Aztecas. That's a proud thing to be! So how come we let them come down on somebody in our race? No way, man! We show them! What do you think? Okay.

You know, you really shouldn't keep your car here. I know. Whatta you say if I kinda push you over there someplace? Okay. Do you think you can? Are you kidding? Do you know who you're talking to? No. I'll be your engine, okay? All right. Put it in neutral. You like this car? Yes, I do, very much. It's nice. How much did it cost you? I don't know. It was a present. I got it for my 17th birthday. That's a nice present. I know. And I'll send you my bill in the morning. CESAR: I didn't want none of the others here. That's why I'm tellin' you guys first. We're the ones who started the clica, m an. We, the... Oh, it's about time, ese. I want John Vincente out, ese. He's a chicken-shit dude! I tell him what to do last night. He don't do it! I tell him stick the piece in the bastard's mouth, blow his head off. He shoots him in the leg instead. (SHOUTING) What for, man, so he can screw up again? Hey, Cowboy, maybe Cesar's right, ese. We did make the rules. Damn right I'm right, home boy! This is my Azteca and he's with us. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Or not at all. I tell somebody to do somethin', I want him to do it! Otherwise, get another president! Hey, carnal, uh, to jump him, huh? Yeah. I don't want him in my clica no more. CESAR: I want you to understand this. I wanna make sure you understand this. After today, you're not an Azteca no more. That means, you don't come around no more. You don't come no place near us, you hear? You don't tell nobody what we ever talked about. You don't say where we keep our pieces. You just keep your mouth shut! You hear? To us, you don't exist no more. You get in trouble some other clica, tough shit! You go no more insurance. Do you understand that? Cesar, I swear to God... Ooh, good! You want to hear he understands? (ALL YELLING) (GRUNTS) CESAR: Hit him! Leave him! Let's go, Emilio. Come on, Emilio, let's go. Let's go. Let's go cruise up. Let's go get some home girls. I know this nice... (TELEPHONE RINGING) RECEPTIONIST: Community Action Center. All right, guys, let's go. Hey, where's Cesar? COWBOY: He had some business, man. What do you mean, he had some business? I said I wanted to talk to all four of you. He couldn't make it. MIKE: Aw, he couldn't make it. All right, come on, let's go. Hey, Russell, you got those forms? Straight ahead, man. Straight ahead, Diego. Make yourselves comfortable, huh? GANNETT: Call downtown and see who Central had. Yeah, yeah, well, I told you I was takin' care of that, man. Yes, sir. Mmm-hmm. Well, I'll settle that when I get to the office. Sure. This is Sergeant Gannett, of the Police Department. He's here because there's a 15-year-old kid in the hospital. It's a kid who belongs to your gang. His name is... It's a club, Sergeant. His name is Vicente Carranza. Anybody know how he got hurt? Where's Arrelano, Mike? You said he'd be here. He couldn't come, Jim. He's the leader of your gang, isn't he, this Cesar Arrelano? He's president of our club, Sergeant. Well, this Carranza kid, a patrol unit found him in a field behind the airport. His arm was broken, half of his teeth was knocked out. He's in a coma and the hospital says he may not pull through. Does anybody know what happened? Who do you think did it? Maybe some other club, Sergeant. Yeah, from Santa Monica, maybe. Culver City. Crazy dudes over there. What about you? Do you think some other club did It? That's a possibility. Do you know what "jumping out" is? I've heard that term. Mike and I both think this Carranza kid was jumped out of the Aztecs. What do you think? He might die. Now that makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? One of your own brothers dying because of some stupid gang bullshit. Sarge, it's a club! It's a gang, punk! And don't be interruptin' me when I'm talkin'! You didn't invent gang-busting. I was a member of the East L.A. Guardians before your mother and father even thought you up! In those days, we called it war counseling. That's right, I was a war counselor. But it's the same bullshit any way you slice it! Was Vicente Carranza macho enough for you today? Did he have enough balls to make it through your line? Well, I hope he has enough balls to make it through the night. Thanks, Mike. (DOOR OPENS) I don't know what's worse, Chicano cop or a nigger cop! They're all punks, ese. (SIGHS) MIKE: Okay, we got the law in here again, huh? Sometimes, you guys make me sick, do you know that? You guys think you got it made 'cause you're not 18 yet. You get into a mess, the most you can get is six months and then you're out in the damn streets again. I did nine months at that camp. And you didn't learn much there either, did you? Hey, Mike, I learned how to read and write English. That's more than I ever learned in school! Yeah, but that didn't make you any smarter, my friend. Would you like to go back to that camp? Who the hell cares? Besides, it was easy. I could do nine months standing on my head. Yeah, but what happens when you're 18, Diego? Name's Dagger. You can write any name you want on that wall. To me, you're still Diego. Do you know what happens when you're 18? COWBOY: Yeah. His record gets wiped clean. Whatever he done as a juvenile don't matter no more. They start you from scratch! You start with a clean slate. I mean, just think of that chance. Don't you understand? When are you gonna be 18 anyway? October 21st. That's next month. Yeah. Well, that's when they're gonna start treating you like a man, Diego. Will you be a man by then? Will any of you be men? (CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (PLAYS WRONG NOTE) (SPUTTERING) Hi. I'm the great mechanic, remember? Yeah, hi. So what was wrong with it? Oh, they still don't know. They had to tow it away.

He's worked on the car before. Okay then. How you gettin' home? The bus. You want a lift? What's your name anyway? Sarah Lassiter. Didn't we have art together once? No, I don't think so. I think so.

I wasn't pregnant. You were pregnant. Tell me about it. (LAUGHS) You're funny. Anyway, my father, see, he split and my mother came up here all by herself. I never met him, my father. I wouldn't even know him if I fell over him. How about you? Your people still together? My people? Yes, they're together. Good. What does he do, your father? He's a dentist. (CHUCKLES) How about... Maybe I oughta look him up. Get my teeth fixed. Oh, he's a periodontist, actually. What's that? He takes care of gums. Are you thirsty? No. Are you Jewish? What? Am I Jewish, did you say? You see, Sarah, lots of dentists are Jewish. (LAUGHING) No, I'm not. I... I don't know what I am, actually. I'm English, I think, and Irish and Scotch and maybe a little German. Well, I'm Spanish, and Toltec and Nahuac, and maybe a little Chichimecas. You want some ice cream? You were born here though, weren't you? Oh, yeah, right here. Well, not in Venice, actually. I was born in East Los Angeles. What was that you just did? What? This. This? (CHUCKLES) This. That means I'm from Venice. That's my neighborhood, my barrio! Venice. I love Venice. I never wanna leave Venice. And that's, that's my barrio! I love Venice. You want a hamburger? No, thank you. No? Okay. My car is nice, huh? But I got my eye on this '68 Riviera. Really sweet car. I'm gonna put on some silver paint panels, you know? Boy, would that be a smooth ride? Yeah? But you see the problem is that the guy, he wants like 900 bucks more. I figure I could sell, I could sell my Ford for, I don't know, 2,000 bucks. I gotta come up with 900 bucks. You might as well say 9,000 bucks. Yeah, well, listen, great. Well, listen, Emilio, this is my house. Nice area. Yeah, it's nice. Well, listen, thanks a lot, Emilio. Oh, that's... That's Emilio. Ay-mee-lio. Ah, yes. Emi... Emilio. Emilio. Emilio. Right. Right.

You know, I was thinkin' maybe, you know, you might really enjoy it. I don't think so. But thanks a lot, really for everything. Why not? Is it because I'm Chicano? Is that it? Ah, that's no reason. So what do you say? Okay. Okay. (GIGGLES) (WHISTLING) MRS. MENDEZ: Your cousins are here, Emilio. Hey, hi. Don't you look pretty? Ooh. Hey, Emilio.

Thanks for letting me know. I was getting worried. Si. I'll catch you later, man. Okay. Who was that? That was Cowboy. Cowboy? Who's Cowboy? Julio Zamora. He calls himself Cowboy. Why? I don't know why, Ma, he just calls himself Cowboy. What did he want? He called to tell me that his cousin Vicente died. Vincente who? Vicente Carranza. I know his mother. How did he get hurt? He was in an accident, I guess. I really don't know. Anyway, he's gonna be all right. Your friend Cowboy, is he in a gang? No, chale, no! Then why does he call himself Cowboy, I mean, if his name is Julio? Probably belongs to a club or something. When these guys belong to a club, they give themselves these names. What club? I don't know. Does Vicente belong to it? I don't know! Is it Los Aztecas? What I see on the walls, Los Aztecas? Because that is not a club, Emilio, that is a gang! Los Aztecas, a gang! Look at me! Swear to me that you don't belong to that gang. I swear. Swear on the Virgin. I swear on the Virgin. You know, I'll take you to a real good hot dog place. So listen, Sarah, you didn't tell me, you know, why? Because I was curious about the word. "Chicano?" Yes. So you mean, you just went to the library, huh? Uh-huh. Do you know what it means? It means "double-cross" in slang. What? Who told you that? The book! That book told you tha"Chicano" means "double-cross?" (SCOFFS) That book, that's crazy. Chicano, that's a word of honor and of pride. Get in. Where did you get that book? I told you, in the library. You mean, you just went into the library and you asked for a book on Chicanos? Yes. Why? Because I knew we were going out tonight. That really pisses me off. That really pisses me off, you know that? Why? Because it's like I'm a midget or something. And you went into the library and you got a book on midgets. That's the best hot dog in all of Venice. Very good. I'd say maybe in all of Los Angeles, right there in your hand. So tell me about that time? Well... We just moved from the Valley to the Marina, right? And I was 12 years old, and this girl was sleeping over for the night.

Armed robbery is a felony. Now two of you went in there this afternoon, and one of you got away. Cowboy won't say who it was. The store owner will.

Aw, this is a waste of time. I've got all the time in the world. Let's go, Emilio. (SHUTTER SLAMMING) CESAR: I don't care which one of you was with Cowboy. That don't matter to me.

But that don't matter. When you look in the mirror, stare him down. Make him know he fingers one Azteca, the rest of us come back to get him! You understand?

You see these letters here? C.S.? That means Con safos! That means "safe" in Spanish. Looks like a crucifix. Are you religious? I don't think this is a crucifix. I really don't know what it is. You put it on your hand yourself, didn't you? Oh, yeah. But you see, a lot of guys, they put it on their hands. It's like a superstition, you know? It don't mean nothing. I see. It don't mean nothin'? No, nothin' at all. This course is fine. Sails look good. Uh, Sarah, maybe we ought to get lunch started. Lunch. Yeah. Beautiful. I could stop her from seeing you, you know? She still listens to me. You know that won't work. What makes you so sure? I know Sarah. All right, then. From now on you pick her up at the house. No more street corners. Yes, sir. Sarah? Yeah? Would you like to come up here and take the helm? Yes. Thank you. I'm, uh, going below to get something to drink. Would you like something? No, thank you. Well, what did he say? I think it's okay. Well, is it or isn't it? I think so. (LAUGHING) I don't know if they would invite my mother to supper yet, but it's okay. (INDISTINCT TALKING) Hey, whatchen, vatos. Somebody crossed out my name. Con safos is supposed to mean free and clear safos. This wall, my place, man! That's my name on it. Whoever crossed it out, he answers to me. EL TIGRE: So... Why did Cesar send you, man? I mean, such a big man! Why didn't he come himself? He don't trust you. You crossed out his name, Tigre. You shouldn't have done that. Don't point at me, man! There was a treaty between the twclicas. You shouldn't have started this. He never should've marked the walls! That was nobody's wall. Where was that wall? Santa Monica. Yeah, Santa Monica, right. So when did Santa Monica become Azteca territory, huh? Santa Monica is Los Espiritus, man! It's ours! Did you get that? Ours! Cesar wrote on it, and we crossed it off! That's all there is to it! You crossed it off. Yeah, I crossed it off, so what? Tigre, you're a dead man. Cesar says to tell you that. He's gonna waste you, Tigre. He's gonna plant you six feet under, man. And something else, Tigre, you tell your president that Los Espiritus... MAN: Tell me yourself, Emilio. Hello, Hugo. What's the matter now, Emilio? I think you know what the matter is. When Clemente was president of this club... Clemente got busted in June. I'm president now. So why don't you take care of your members? You got a jerk like El Tigre here, he goes and he does something stupid! He didn't do nothin' stupid! If we see Venice writing here in Santa Monica, we cross it out, man. That's it. Hugo, you're fooling with Los Aztecas. That's too bad about Los Aztecas. If they don't wanna see their names crossed out, man, you tell 'em not to write on the walls out here. Cesar says, "No more safe passage." If anybody on Los Espiritus gets caught coming through, he gets jumped. Then you better stay out of Santa Monica, man. Because the same thing happens here. Los Aztecas go wherever they want. Not if the shit is on, man. He's telling you it's on, that's why I'm here. Now, I think you better get the hell outta here, man, while you can still walk. What is it? Your grandmother's dead. Emilio. Mamacita. She wants to go home, for the funeral. Si. Si, mamacita. They called from Mexico about an hour ago. Mama, do you want me to go with you? Si, Emilio. Okay. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) I just heard the news, senora. I'm so sorry. Gracias. Emilio. If you've got a minute, I'd like to talk to you, all right? Outside. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Emilio, did you go to Santa Monica today? Hey, look, I'm talking to you. Is it true you went to Santa Monica today to meet with Los Espiritus? Look, Mike, what do you want from me? I want you to stay out of what's coming. Man, chale, there ain't nothin' coming. (CHUCKLING) Don't "chale" me, huh? Mas respeto, man. You know, Cesar is bragging all over the barrio he's gonna get El Tigre. He's gonna show Los Espiritus! Stay out of it, Emilio! I'm an Azteca. I can't stay out of it. Cowboy's an Azteca, too. Yeah. And he's going to jail! Cesar's an Azteca, too. And he's talking about killing somebody! Is that what an Azteca is supposed to be? You wanna know? MIKE: Yeah! Okay, I'll tell you, man. It is somebody with honor! Somebody with pride in his race! Our race, Mike! We'rChicanos! We're Aztecas! And the two of them together... Si, muy macho. Si, muy macho! I'm an Azteca, Mike, and that is something! No, that is bull-shit! To call myself an Aztec? You know how many guys would give their right arms to call themselves an Azteca? How about calling yourself Emilio Mendez? How about finding your pride and your honor and your Goddamn manhood in that? Could you try that, Emilio? For once in your Goddamn life try that. Stay out of it, Emilio. How long will you be gone? Oh, only two or three days. I'm just going down for a funeral. I'm really gonna miss you, Sarah. (SHOUTING) You wanna tell me what the matter is with you? You lied to me! You belong to a gang, Emilio! I asked Carl, in my English class. What the hell difference does it... "What the hell difference does it make?" Jesus! You expect me to go with somebody who belongs to a gang? Somebody who goes around breaking heads? That's right! We break heads, Sarah! Why? We kick ass! Oh! I belong to a gang, Sarah! Los Aztecas! Oh, no! I'm proud of it! And when I walk down that street in Venice, I hold my head high because I have my brothers! That's right, Sarah. Why? I'm proud of it! Because I need them, that's why. Because when I'm in trouble, they come running, that's why! I'm sorry, Sarah, but that is just the way it is. Oh, God! (SNIFFLING) Just the way it is. (BAND PLAYING SLOW MARIACHI MUSIC) MAN: Alicia. I'm sorry about your mother. You gonna be here long? We leave tomorrow. Jerry, this is your son. She never told you, huh? Never. Who'd you think I was? She said you were a handsome Mexican businessman. It's true enough. I run a taxi service here. Gerald R. Kelsey, Mexican Transit System. Drink up, you're not drinkin'. Don't you drink? How old are you anyway? Wait a minute, don't tell me. I'll be 18 in May. You're a good-looking kid, Emilio. You take after your old man. You got a lot of girls up there in L.A.? I have a girl. (CHUCKLING) Now, what else did she say about me, your mother? She said, you left! Yeah, I left. Why? I didn't wanna marry her. She was 16, I was 28. And I didn't want my balls cut off either. I couldn't come back to this town till after her father died. Very big on them, honor, bullshit! (SCOFFING) These Mexicans, you know. So what do you do up there in L.A.? I go to high school. You on any teams? I used to play football in high school. I drifted down here to Mexico after the Korean War. I met your mother. Well, you know, I had to leave. You could've stayed. Tell me something. Did you think that I was a Mexican? Did you think that your old man was a greaser? I didn't know what you were. Well, you know now. (CHUCKLING) Hi. Hi. How was it? It was okay. Hey, met my father. Yeah. He's an Anglo. Who'd have guessed that, huh? There are guys in Los Aztecas, they've got skin, you know, much lighter than me. They got Spanish blood going back centuries, and me, I got an Anglo father. Mexico... Mexico is really something. Beautiful. I didn't even know half the things they did down there, in Mexico. And that's Mexico down there, Mexico. And what the hell does Mexico have to do with me? I was born right here in East Los Angeles, and I got an Anglo father. Oh... Mexico, (MUMBLING) US of A. Well, it's like going back to maybe, 100 years. Sarah, my father... On the plane coming back, you know, I asked her. I said, "Why didn't you tell me? Why did you let me believe "my father was..." I don't know, I don't know what I thought. Handsome Mexican businessman, that could be anything. She told me she didn't wanna confuse me. Wow, she told me she wanted me to be proud of my heritage, proud of my language, proud of being Chicano. Confuse me. Well, if I'm not American and I'm not Mexican, then what the hell am I? They tell me... Tell me I'm Chicano, but they're just selling me a bunch of bull! They're selling me a word about honor and pride! Because I don't even know who I am! Sarah, my father, he's an Anglo! He's a drunk! He's a... His clothes stink of vomit! I didn't mean to say that. Milo. No, leave me. Some machismo, huh? Your father, he thinks I am Pancho Villa, come to steal his daughter. What he doesn't realize is that I am Pancho ninguno. Pancho nobody. I couldn't steal you if I tried. You don't have to steal me, Emilio. No, huh? I love you. I love you, too. I don't know what to do. I know you want me to quit the gang. Yes! I know that's what you want, but you see, Sarah, if I quit Los Aztecas, what have I got left? Me. And when I lose you, Sarah? You're not gonna lose me. MRS. MENDEZ: He told you, Emilio, why I cannot go to the presentacion, I am in mourning. SARAH: Yes, I'm sorry, Mrs. Mendez. You don't have this in your religion? A presentacion? No. What is your religion? Presbyterian. This has Jesus? Yes. How long have you known Emilio? Just a little while. Did you meet in school? Yes, we did.

That's good. (SIGHS) My brothers! You remember Espanol? They don't think he's gonna make it. Oh, God! And for nothing. Some guy of Los Espiritus hit him across the neck with a machete. And Danny... You don't know Danny. Danny got shot in the back. Dear God! I don't know how many of them Los Aztecas got, but Dagger told me. There were guys laying all over the place. You stayed out of it, that's all that matters. Milo, they won't try to hurt you, will they? No. Are you sure? You don't have to worry. Emilio, please, tell me, what will they do to you? They jumped me out. What does that mean? Sarah, there are just some things you'll never understand. It's late. I better get going. Milo? No, listen, I'm okay. Hey, you! I'd like you to step up on the curb, please. EMILIO: What? I'm gonna ask you a few questions. (MOUTHING) What's this? I cut my hand. Where do you live? I live in Venice. What? I live in Venice.

He's a friend of mine. He's my friend. Now take it easy, miss. Oh, but he's a friend of mine. Come on, Jake. Does this happen a lot? Hey, wait a minute. Sarah, you told them that I was your friend. What if you had to tell them that I was your boyfriend? What if you had to say that we were engaged, or this is my husband? "This man here is my husband." What would you do then, Sarah? I'd say what had to be said. Would you? Emilio, I did say it. They knew exactly what I was talking about. You see, it's never gonna work in a million years. Emilio, I love you. That's all that matters. I love you, too. But how can this work? Don't you see that? Milo. (GULLS CAWING) What are you doing here? How did you find out where I'd be? I called Katie. She told me you'd be here. Oh, Emilio, don't do this. I have to. No. You don't have to do anything you don't wanna do. Sarah, go home! Just get the hell out of here! For Christ sakes, go. Please. I want you to understand this. I wanna make sure you understand this. After today, you're not an Azteca no more. That means you don't come around no more. You don't come no place near us, you hear? You don't tell nobody what we ever talked about... Save your breath, Cesar. I know it by heart. I think you better save yours, maybe! We're gonna break every bone in your body, Emiliano. You get up off the ground again, es un milagro. You know why we doing this? 'Cause you're a disgrace to Los Aztecas. And when you disgrace us, you disgrace the Chicano people! That's bullshit! They're not the same thing, ese. I'm gonna beat the shit out of you anyway, ese. And then I'm personally gonna kick your ass through that line! Good, you do... (GROANING) CARLOS: Emilio? Emilio.
