Send me a signal. A sign. Did they answer you? You leave ? Bizarre. What's weird? When you wear makeup, you either go out or you cry. No, I'm not going out and I'm not crying. Quoi ? Mom, what is this blood? It's a client of dad's who brought us a rabbit. Pajamas, now! Health. - Mom, I made a cloud! - Very pretty. Many. - What color is it ? - Green. Eat. No, it's purple.

Little Jesus of my life You are a child, like me That's why I love you so much And I offer you my heart Take it It's yours, not mine See you tomorrow. What do you see ? Looks like microbes with dots. It is the nucleus of the cell. One thing always hides another. Are we like that in it, too? Yes, we are also a bit like that. Is it more important what's inside or outside? The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. It's not possible, this shitty country! Tell me, am I calling an ambulance? Alright, hi. She is fine. Not true ? You feel better ? Yes mom. I feel better.

Mom too. - Isn't it, ma'am? - Yes. - What's your name ? -Andrea. Adri, like Adriana. Sorry. You can sit ? Breathe hard. The bronchi are free. You breathed something special before the crisis? It is important. I ate a lot of "body of Christ". What do you mean ? What did you eat ? I went to church and took hosts. And then what happened? I do not remember. But why did you eat all those hosts? Like that. We had sworn to tell each other everything. They must do a miracle for me. Who ? What miracle are you talking about? You and dad have done me wrong. I am not Adriana. You're not Andrea either, my love. You see ? I come from another galaxy. And you don't have the powers to change me. We did it ? How far ? Up to the balloons. Shouting ? Of course, by shouting! Get away ! Health. Who are you ? Take. It's Andrea, a friend. Hi Andrea. We Dance ? The pretty lady ! Bonjour. - Can we stay with you for a while? - We offer you a coffee. Ignore them. - You are charming. - Go away ! A second ! - Where are you going ? - Go away ! Mount, Adri. Calm down, kid! Get out! Calm down ! Get out! Why are you doing this ? They're assholes and you're too beautiful. Can you stop being so beautiful? Calm down, It's finish. And I'm not beautiful, I'm ugly. I am terrible. - Look at your mother. - Stopped ! How ugly she is. Look at your mother... Stopped. - How ugly your mother is! - That's enough. You want to talk ? We sing ? Stopped ! Ready? One two three ! Dad, speed up! Left turn ! To the left ! Take it easy, please. Here they are. Hello, sorry for the delay. Don't get out of the car. Let's leave immediately, otherwise we'll never arrive. Felice, don't roll like a snail! Alberto, please don't start. I'm kidding. - Your brother is stupid. - I know. Here we go ! Please don't be crazy. Let's go ! Can you watch the road? Right turn ! If you keep going, I'm jumping out of the car. I jump out of the car! Stop it, let's have a little fun. It doesn't amuse me. Come on, we're on vacation! - Do you know how to pilot a boat? - No, but I would like to. Why do you never take off your T-shirt? I will burn. Put on some cream. I do not like that. Why don't we go out together? Why don't you close it? Pardon. Who is he ? Will see. Goodbye Mom. Have a good trip. I go ? On and go Put your hand there. Where are we going ? I dunno. Look at all those cobwebs. - Over there. - It flows. It's disgusting! Have they ever asked you how they were born? I got away with the cabbage and the rose so far, we'll see after. They aren't stupid though! They never asked me that kind of question, they managed on their own. They didn't do so well. Adri believes she is the daughter of an alien. She told me that her father is Spanish, that she is not Felice's daughter , and that you ran away from Spain because you were pregnant with her. What a beautiful story. She has an overflowing imagination, this child, fingers crossed. What do you mean ? Nothing. It's just that she lives in a world of her own. You don't worry? It's not the children's imagination that worries me, it is rather the imagination of adults, who still take themselves for children. There is too much silence here. You think ? But where are the children? I will see. Adrian! Claudia ! Swabian! They are looking for us, we have to get out. Hector! Swabian! They are not there. The children! But where did they go? There is nobody ? Do you see them? Mom, we're down there! Over there. We are here ! - Nothing ? - No, they're not here. I hear something. Mom, we're here! We are below! What are you doing here ? It's a maze down there. They will kill us. Let's try to lift that. Together, we will get there. And, two... Attention. A rope... One at a time. The pipe ! Let's try with that. The little ones first. Help Diana. - Put your foot down. - Come on, Gino. Look up, Gino. Alright. Are you doing well ? You got hurt ? Adri, hold on tight. One two three. Attention ! Catch her. From behind ! Get up, come here now! Don't run away, it's worse. grain! Don't do that, look at me. Enough ! Fresh water! What ? You are afraid ? Stop it, mom. Stop it, mom. You could have suffocated to death, do you realize? Who had this idea? It's me. It's all of our fault. So, a good slap to everyone, you are already in position. I never hit my children. You can start, since it was his brilliant idea. Mom, give me a slap. Come on. Give me a slap, please. You go-y, maman. It's a slap, right? Come on, stronger. Stronger. Stronger ! Enough. Catch me. - What are you doing ? - Lay over. For what ? Lay over. More over there. Extend your arms. Take the rose. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Where were you ? Did you go behind the reeds? It's dangerous, especially for you and your friend. Go wash up, you must be dirty. Traitor, I will kill you! Why did you tell mom? I'm not a traitor, mom was worried. Must close it! Leave him ! That's enough, stop. It's because of you that mom is worried. And she argues with dad. If Gino leaves the house, there is no longer a problem. It is you who must leave! Make peace. Make peace. The little finger. Little finger. Peace. - Now, a hug. - In addition ! A hug. GOOD. Come on, a hug without a punch. Are you happy? Don't interfere when we argue. What is the problem ? Are you worried about Adriana? Don't be a hypocrite and I don't care what women you sleep with. You're crazy, you're delirious, like Adriana. You invent anything. You don't see the real problem. I'm not even jealous anymore. GOOD. Could we separate? Discreetly, without drama. Who puts that in your head? Separate ? Forget that ! Where are you going? Our daughter wants to be a boy. She thinks she's a boy. She has no limits. Our friends make fun of us because of her. Didn't you notice it? It's humiliating ! That's it, take his defense! You can't even raise it. Why is Adriana always the problem for you? Could the problem be me? The only normal person in this house. Do you really think you're normal? I think you are a bitch. Hosanna in the highest heaven. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest heaven. The body of Christ. Amen. - Hello, Adrian. - Hello Maria. - Is your mom here? - Yes. Can you call her? Mom, dad's secretary is here. Mary, what's going on? Enter, please. Sit down. Tell me. I can't help you, Maria. You are welcome. We didn't do the test of courage today. I don't like the test of courage. I'm not going there alone. Can I see the watch? We're very brave, aren't we, Adri? Oui. Why do we have to be brave? To have powers. When will they give them to us? When we're ready. Who will give them to us? Those who sent us here. Are we going to see them? They are invisible they send signals from heaven. Gino. On sort... - You disgust me. - What do you have ? You are disgusting ! You're crazy ! No scene now! I'm doing well. Non. I'm doing well. Do not look at me like that. No not like this. Go to your room! Mom, open up! Open! Borlotti soup!

Non. Are you sleeping in my bed tonight? Of course. And dad? Do you want to sleep with daddy tonight? All right. Do you love each other, you and dad? Of course. Are you sure ? It'll be OK ? Good night. Do you smoke? You want to try ? I would like to become a dancer. Or contortionist. I would like to travel. I would like to become an astronaut or airplane pilot. Or skydiver. I would like to be in heaven. You're weird as a boy. I know. Close your eyes. Does it look like a boat? Diana, eat. Can't you cut his meat? Got it. Here, eat. It stinks of shit in this house. Mange, Diana. - Stop it, I want more. - Eat. Do you know we're having a brother or a sister? Quoi ? It won't be mama's child. It will be Papa and Maria's child . He's going to live with us? Hope it's a boy. We can call her Andrea. Come, Gino. Give me that and go say hello. Where is Adrian? Come on, I'll keep the present. Gino ! Hello, my treasure. What a beautiful boy. - Hello grandmother. - Adriana. What a pretty young girl you are becoming. Fortunately, not yet. It will ? Oui. Don't worry, go play.

What did you do ? Don't touch anything. One two three ! Sara ! I have to go, it's late. - Already ? - Yes. We have to stay in our room, mum is going to rest. Where ? I dunno. Did you go back there? Oui. Our promises no longer hold? I didn't promise anything. Where you go ? Promise me. Yes. Tell me where you are going. Look at me and promise me. Yes, I promise you. Tell me where you are going. I go to a house, very pretty, where I can rest. They will treat me and I will get back in shape. You are fit. No, Adri. You know I'm not well. I am very... very tired. We will be wiser. Wiser? But you are the best. The best of all. So why are you leaving? Take care of your sister and your brother, they are not as strong as you. You come back when ? As soon as I feel better. Grandma comes to settle here, try to be obedient. I count on you. Are you coming back tomorrow? No, not tomorrow. I am very sorry. Really. But... I can't. I can't. We are small and you are big. Gino, honey, sit up straight. Tighten your elbows. Bravo. We don't play with food, Diana. What are you doing ? It's a flower, grandma. I don't eat the flowers, it's for mom. Are we going to tell mom you're not eating? Will she be happy? Try to eat a little. Come on. A tiny bit. Come on, no fuss. Open the mouth. Open the mouth. Open the mouth ! Leave her ! I will train you! Not moving ! You stay there, until your sister has eaten the last crumb! Felice... That's enough, you too! You can't eat in silence in this house! You pooped behind the door again, go clean up. Non. You have to stop. So stop, you too. Stop what ? To pretend to be a boy. I'm not pretending! Kiss my ass ! A beautiful smile. One. Two... Let's see. Adri, try to smile. Otherwise, mom will be scared. We start again. Hang in there. You will get there, be brave. Come on. And, two... three ! Dad, how is she, mom? Mom is fine, we're taking her home. She has changed ? No, mom is still the same. Wait here. Will mom get tired if we throw confetti at her? No, mom is fine now. Do not move. Maman ! How are you, my loves? Ma petite. Come here. Mom, finally! A kiss, Adrian. Give me a kiss. Happy Carnival! Let's go. Here we are. Hello grandmother. - Hello, Julia. - Welcome. You are in good shape. Merci. She will stay a few days to help us, if you agree. Everything is ready, we sit down to eat whenever you want. - I have one of those hunger pangs! - It's true ? Thanks Mom. Can we show mom the new sofa? Do you like him ? Beautiful. - Should we leave mom alone? - No, a little longer. Let's just stay like this. Did you keep your promise? She no longer went behind the reeds. They cleaned the whole area. They removed the barracks and razed everything. There is not anybody.
