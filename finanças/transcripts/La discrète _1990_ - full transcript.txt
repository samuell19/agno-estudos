Saturday, March 24. Everything began on that day at the Gare de l'Est. I noted in my diary: "Solange left me this morning." It's the first time a woman dumps me. I usually arrange to be the first to leave. - Hello. - Hello. What's wrong? You could've told me you're coming. So I'm telling you. You could've phoned me, let me know. I wanted to surprise you. You shouldn't have come like this. I've been thinking about this and I meant to talk to you. But it bothers me to do it here. You remember what you once told me? We were up all night, I remember it well, I wrote it down at once. It was dawn, you said: "Antoine, I've never had such physical intimacy with anyone but you." When one hears about such intimacy, one can't believe it may end... So when it does, one thinks: "It's just a mistake, she's only testing me." - No, not really. - Then what? Can't you realize that I've had enough, that I don't want to see you or to live with you anymore? So all we've had together doesn't mean anything? Those months, those nights, those words that you said: "I've never had such intimacy with anyone but you." - It's different now. - I can see that. I'll even bet with this guy on a certain level... - It has nothing to do with it. - It's not quite... I don't ask about your lovemaking, although I could. How is it really? - You can only think about that! - What is love for you? A man's compliments to a woman only mean he wants to sleep with her. Say or think of me what you will. Call me every name in the book - I don't care. You remember what you once told me: "Antoine, I'm scared." "Scared of what?" I asked. You replied: "I'm scared of what is happening to us." And you added: "I'm even more scared it might end." I'm not really into 3-way relationships, but for you, I could've made an effort, I could've suggested we'd meet behind his back... if I hadn't seen him. But now when I have, the prospect is terrifying! God knows I want you but now it's just impossible! It's too much for me. I'm rambling. So long. This morning I went to the Gare de l'Est, rather tickled with my plan for our break-up. I meant to tell her like Guitry to one of his wives: "Let's make peace now. Let's separate." - Except that... - Except that... She didn't show up? Yes, she did but not alone. It seems rather banal. I'm afraid it is. What are you going to do? I don't know yet. - Are you going home? - No, of course not. I'd like to take revenge on her but I don't know how. I have so little imagination. THE DISCREET GIRL Friday, March 30. - Yes? - Are you busy today? No, not really. - I have no plans yet. - Can you come by this afternoon? - I will. - I'm counting on you. OK. See you later. Jean's in his office. He's expecting you. He's upstairs? See you. See you. What's up? Here it is. I have a proposition for you. Are you ready to do anything to get published? Of course I am. Are you crazy? It's a good start. Well... Here it is. The publisher I work with has decided to launch a new series, written as personal diaries. I told them at once that you're their man, and you're writing a special kind of diary. - What is this? - Wait until you hear the rest. You know publishers, they don't decide just on a name. They want a solid story. I thought that yours with Solange might interest them. The story itself is just a starting point that needs a follow-up. And that's it. I've got the follow-up. It was easy. You told me: "I want to take revenge but I don't know how." Here's what I propose you... A woman dumped you, and you decided to take revenge, not on a particular woman but women in general. You pick one at random... But in a certain sense you let her pick you. Then no one knows what's going to happen... No one but you. You'll try to enter her life, to seduce her, to make her fall in love with you, and when it happens, you'll dump her. And while you're taking your revenge... You record all the details, day by day, in the style of a personal diary. I even told them I'd already read the first pages and they were great. Trust me, I didn't tell them the story this way. I talked about "new libertinage," "thought eroticized," a perverse taste for revenge... I went all out. As they say: "You don't catch flies with vinegar." Well? Correct me if I'm wrong, what you're asking me is to live a trumped-up story that you've imagined? You think I'll agree? Yes. Tell me, Manu... You're a man of judgment. What would you do in my place? What's it about? - Jean wants me to meet a woman. - So? - He wants me to make her fall for me. - Anyone I know? No, it's a woman picked at random. Do you think I should trust him? It depends. What's it for? To make him work a little. He's so lazy. Some job: to meet a girl, to seduce her... To seduce her and then to dump her! Well, is it yes or no? I need to think it over. Come on, just put an ad in the paper. No, not in a newspaper. That makes you look like a regular at this kind of thing. Let's just try to write it up. "Wanted: "Girl able to..." "Novelist seeking girl..." No, "novelist" sounds lewd. "Publisher." "Publisher..." Yes! "Publisher seeking... a student." How young? The typist? Yes, I have a customer in her 50s... No, I prefer a student. Someone under 25... because they're tax deductible. It's for a company... Too bad. One of my daughters could've qualified but... she just moved out of town. Too bad. It's done! My painfully written ad, typed up and posted by by the baker's fat fingers. I lay in wait. Heart pounding, I await my muse and prey... fully aware of the childishness of my act... yet delighted with the risk incurred. Only one question now interests me: what will she be like? I hate bad surprises... and meeting an ugly girl wouldn't be very stimulating. Here I am, miles from any moral debate... ready to plunge into libertinage. I wonder if I'd better use a pseudonym. Tuesday, April 3. Responses arrived soon. Two candidates deemed too old (around 30) were turned down. I gave my secretary Monique strict orders: no one over 25. I bet she was shocked. She's one of those virtuous women who love to blush. The candidate's name is Catherine Legeay. At last! She left her number. I'm a little edgy, like on a first date. Say, your ad was for a typist or for a date? Your dress is very low cut. It's a summer dress. Hello. Ext. 55, please. You didn't even ask about my vacation. - Had a good vacation, Monique? - Great. Thank you. And you? Well, I roamed and idled about far from the "vile crowd"... as Mr. Thiers used to say. By the way, here's my new address. Hello? May I speak with Ms. Catherine Legeay, please? Speaking. Hello, I'm the one who put up the ad. Done! The meeting is set. Her name is Catherine Legeay. She's French... She teaches at a language school, she can type... She has a rather nice phone voice. I'm meeting her tomorrow at 5pm at the "Caf? de la Mairie." I got to the caf? 10 minutes ahead of time. The manuscript she is to type is most edifying. It's called "Dressing Intimately." Its author, an old erotomaniac... a distinguished member of some Academy, who preferred to remain anonymous. The text, at once erudite, rather perverse and gently misogynous... makes an excellent introduction to this first encounter. Excuse me, Miss, do we have a date? Excuse me? I'm meeting a lady here. Is it you? No, I don't think so. Are you the one I spoke with on the phone? Yes, I am. Please, sit down. A grenadine soda, please. Is something bothering you? This thing on your head. You don't like it? Your hair is wet. I was at the pool, I didn't have time to dry it. I was afraid I'd be late. I could've waited a few minutes longer. I spend most of my time in this caf?. It's where I work. Here? Yes, I give them an extra hand during the noon rush. No, just kidding. Ever retyped corrected galleys? No. That could be a problem. It can't be that complicated. It's more complicated than it seems. What is it about? Women. It was written by an old man who dedicated his life... to the study of the way women have groomed themselves through the ages. Though it seems to be written by an old onanist it's rather interesting. The chapter on beauty spots is most instructive. In the 17th century, women wore what's called "patches." Little dots of black taffeta that they glued to their faces or breasts to set off the whiteness of their skin. On the forehead it was called a "Majestic"... Near the eye, a "Passionate," near the lip, a "Galante"... To hide a pimple, a "Thief"... On the chin, like your mole, it was called the "Discreet." Now when you know it, there are about 120 pages... That means 4 or 5 days. Would it be possible to get it back on Monday? Monday is a bit difficult. I have other jobs. You'd better not. Did I mention the fee? It's 35 francs a page, the current rate. That's fine. - You came by subway? - I walked. I'll walk you back. Here. Yes. I've looked for it for years. It's very rare, especially in such a good condition. Yes, indeed. - How much did you say? - 1,200 francs. It's beautiful. And the keyhole on the cover looks lovely. It's quite remarkable. Indeed. Do you still have "Flesh for a Prayer Rug"? No, it was sold this morning. Too bad. I'll look for another copy, and will put it aside for you. Yes, please. Thank you. Manu, bring a bag, please. - Never mind. - Are you sure? Don't forget to send me your next catalog. Don't worry. You're on my list. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Did you see her? - Yes. She's revolting! I didn't notice. She seemed a bit young, perhaps. I was sitting calmly but I took a precaution... I positioned myself in a recess, to see and not to be seen. Suddenly, this girl rushed at me. She could've hesitated, looked around... paused long enough for me to rush to the men's room and hide. No, she came straight to me as if she knew me. I was stunned and stuck. I felt so embarrassed. Accosted by this girl in that get-up! I felt everyone was staring at us! I was so humiliated! Next to that gorgeous girl nearby! Come on, she's not that bad. Didn't you see her? She's revolting! So what? What? What does it matter? What do you mean? Who cares if you like her or not. Maybe it's a plus. If she were a men's magnet that wouldn't be interesting. No, but between a top-model and this dwarf... On the contrary. This situation could be beneficial to your writing. Where's the challenge if you like each other? What makes this adventure worthwhile is... its difficulty, the fact that you don't like her. She's repulsive! So she is. That makes it even better! If, to seduce her, you must overcome your disgust and redirect your desire - all the more credit to you. Credit? It's not you who has to sleep with her! Admit that for this project to succeed she has to fall for you. Yes. Except, women able to love a man sincerely... and become attached to him are pretty rare. That's why this girl would be good. It's often among the outwardly modest that one finds true lovers. The women capable of great sacrifices for love. Nowadays it's valuable. Your Catherine is a real heroine for a novel! She's exactly what you need! No, no way! You have no choice. You signed a contract. - Come now, Jean! - "Come now" what? You saw the girl! I have no desire to see her again, let alone to... Well, I don't give a damn about that girl of yours! All that matters is your promise to me and to yourself! The work that you owe me, the diary! I want that diary! Use this girl or any other girl, or... make it all up if you can! But get to work! What is it? We're closed. - It says "Open." - No, we're closed for inventory. I expected your reaction. I knew you'd make trouble. Saying this girl is ugly is just an alibi. You're just scared. Scared to start writing! You're mistaken. You'd rather stick to your menial secretarial job at the Senate! You lack ambition, Antoine! Look, I'll continue on one condition. From now on, you'll tell me exactly what to do. You'll tell me when and where to see her, what to tell her, and how to behave. Expect no initiative from me. I'll just follow you instructions, OK? Very well. She will call you... tomorrow or after tomorrow. The manuscript has one page missing. When she finds out, she'll call you. Find a way to get to her place. It might help. And once I'm there? Once you're there, above all, don't rush anything. - When's the Senate session? - Late April. Good. That gives us some time. The worst would be for her to fancy you. If it happens on the first day, there'd be no story. You meet, she likes you, you chat with her a bit... and off to bed. That's fine but it's just 3 lines. That's not enough for a book. What we need is for your second meeting to turn sour. That's it, really sour. So that the next time... you'd have someting to make up for. That's always good. Friday, April 6. I found a title for my novel and a nickname for the girl. The mole on her chin gave me the idea. From now on, I'll call her "Discreet." Hello. It's Catherine. One page is missing. - What? A missing page? - Yes. It's impossible. You must've lost it. I checked it thoroughly before I gave it to you. I swear it's not me. I searched everywhere. Look again. I will but I doubt it. Goodbye, miss. Goodbye. The set-up worked exactly as planned. Totally confident in our strategy, I went to her place... ready to commit any ignominy to reach my goal... to offend the damsel. Hello! I had the page. I accused you wrongly. Hello. Here it is. - May I come in for a sec? - Yes. Want to sit down? No, I prefer to stand. Excuse me, but I have to finish this. I'll soon have the first part ready for you. It's alright. Take your time. Is this a furnished flat? No. Why? Just curious. Have you lived here for long? Three months. Not bad. Remember, when I talked about patches the other day... women sported them to set off the whiteness of their skin... It's wrong. Men are first of all visual. The patches' function was to attract their eye or even make them squint. It was simple but amazingly efficient - quite an invention. Jankelevitch wrote somewhere: "Man is optical in essence." But women always knew that. Even the less pretty ones, those above all. They know that to be loved, they have to be far more imaginative. - It's unfair but that's how it is. - Oh shit! - You don't let it dry? - No. Funny. When I see a friend with an ugly girl, I tell myself: "Can't he see charming girls abound... while his is barely passable?" Then I think he must be the wisest of men, wiser than me. He loves that girl for her true qualities... because she's nice to him. But I never really manage to convince myself. I think many men rather cowardly settle... for whatever they can get. Don't you agree? I'd like to work, if you don't mind. I'm sorry. Just one anecdote... When I was in boarding school in the 5th grade... There was this tall, Germanic-type boy who fascinated me. We were 12 or 13. He was called Flack. He never ever used foul language. I thought he was more mature and had more class than we did. But the fathers didn't seem to like him much. Though he was quite a serious guy, and went to communion every day. Whereas we were wild. Then one day... we learned that he should've never been in our school. For this strange attitude of his, you see... this both glaring and vacant stare... we took to be superior qualities, were those of a retard. He was crazy! That's how I feel when I see a guy with a cow. I begin envying his sort of grace, and then I think... Listen, I'd like to finish this. - Have I offended you? - No. It's the way you watch me that bothers me. Then I'll stand still behind you so you won't see me. No, not behind my back! But you won't see me! - I'll still feel your stare. - I swear I won't look at you! I'd like you to leave. - Have I offended you? - Let go of me! Are you crazy? What did I do? Get out. I'll give you the text later. I really don't understand! - Anyway, will you call me on Sunday? - Yes. I'm counting on you! Call me on Sunday. It all went exactly as planned. The damsel threw me out in no time. With my misdeed carried out, I rush to the nearby florist... my letter of apology in my pocket. There's no more efficient apology than a bunch of flowers. Women are much more pragmatic than us. They know love doesn't exist, only tokens of it. Hence their attachment to these little signs of attention... men seldom bestow upon them, much to their loss... alien as they are to any psychology. Hello, Manu. Is Jean in? He left 5 minutes ago. Is he coming back? - He said to close up and left. - Did he say where he went? No, he didn't. Tell him I'll come by tomorrow. Good night. Bye! Ewa? What's wrong? It's nothing. I'm alright. Are you sick? No, I'm just a little tired. Shall I make you some verbena tea? No. Vegetable soup? No, I'm not hungry. Thank you. Shall I fix you some tea with milk? Yes, please. - I'll fix it then. - Thanks. Sunday, April 8. A diary or a novel is at its best... only when its author drifts away from his subject... into some personal comment. I notice that while waiting for the typed manuscript, i.e. in the girl's absence, this diary grows thicker with thoughts and anectodes. Hello. Yes? Hello, it's Catherine. Is this for me? I'm finished. I can bring your text tomorrow. Yes. Tomorrow at 1pm. I got it. Wait, I'll write down the address... It's 14, Avenue Trudaine. Got it. See you tomorrow. Did you receive my flo...? Not a word about the flowers... Very well. I'm going to sink her. I really hate people who hang up without answering your questions. I'm in no hurry, so I'll let her cool her heels in the street... to test the limit of her patience. I have plenty of time. A final note before the assault: Today little Catherine actually looks less horrendous than the other day. Could it be that behind her plain facade... she hides treasures of licentiousness? But there she goes, with her chaperone... Let's get to work! It's time for the final thrust! Good, I've found you! It took me 10 minutes to find a parking spot! - Have you already ordered? - Yes, we have. Obviously, even with flowers you remain deaf. In the Middle Ages, when a man asked for forgiveness... he instantly gained public esteem. When Gilles de Rais was led to the gallows... You know who he was? He killed children? He raped them and slit their throats... Anyway, when Gilles walked up to the gallows... he knelt and prayed for his companions' salvation. Then in an immense, terrible silence... he turned to the crowd that had come to watch him die... where stood probably the parents of the kids he had murdered... And addressing that crowd, he begged for forgiveness. As the first flames rose around him... in the field where all of Nantes had gathered... everyone wept! What's your job? I answer the mail, I write inaugural speeches... If you knew how many of those I have to write! It sounds fascinating. Yes, but not really. If you need anything, some administrative problem... don't hesitate to call me. So you're a writer? You work in publishing too? I do rewrites. Right now, I'm working with a friend. Who is he? He's sort of an ascetic. Bye! See you later! He's an ascetic but he's also a mediocrity. - Lunch at the Senate? - Yes, with no hesitations. It seems to be going well. Now you need to see her again... just like old friends, with nothing special happening between you. Normally, after a while, she'll wonder why you haven't jumped her bones. Usually, where a guy takes a girl to a movie, or somewhere else... it's not for her conversation. His aim is usually lower. I have no particular aims in mind. But these women you date, then leave at their doors... What do they think? What do you mean? If they go out with you, it may not only be for your philosophizing... Why not? It'd surprise me. You're known as a ladies' man. Women who go out with you are fully aware... of your reputation and what it implies. Not at all, Jean, and there's the rub. Women are far less demonstrative than you think. How often have I learned, by chance, in a mere conversation... that a certain woman found me charming, or even loved me... while she'd never given me a clue! Yet how easy it is, with a question, a hint of a smile, to convey interest. One can hardly imagine... how many women are unable to communicate their desire! I'm sure this girl is like that. But I can't be sure until I've tried. Don't try anything directly. Yes, you must please her, but delay any conclusion as long as possible. So at first, remain neutral. Observe her reactions. If you see she starts to like you, do nothing. If she's indifferent, then you must act, like it or not. She can't be completely indifferent. After all, she easily accepted lunch at the Senate. The apology trick worked. I even mentioned Gilles de Rais, can you imagine? Usually quotes can be really dangerous. But I could feel she was intrigued. The Senate is a good idea. A touch of solemnity. Yes, but what will I say to her? I usually hate to share dishes but... It's very good. I'd like to ask you... Why did you answer my ad? Because I needed money. I'd just moved to Paris from London. - Hello, Antoine. - Hello. What are you doing here? You haven't left? No, I haven't. - You're not on vacation? - I'm already on vacation. You're like my husband, hard to move. He loves you, he doesn't need an escape. It's the best! I'll have to tell him that. Do so. This woman terrifies me. So you lived in England. Why? Were you pursuing a man? No, I studied there. I got a scholarship. It's shocking, how many girls run off... under the flimsiest excuses... It's true! For a time, most girls I knew wanted to go to South America. Those were the days of flutes, caps and brown llamas. South America! In the age of feminism! It's crazy! Don't you think? And you never go away? I do, when I'm invited. So, did you get your degree in England? - No, I quit. - Why? On Wednesdays I go swimming. Want to come along? No, no! Don't you like to swim? It's good for you. - I've been to pools before. - Then come with me! I don't want to. Besides, I don't have a bathing suit. You can rent one. To rent a bathing suit? You must be crazy! If you don't want to swim, you can just lie in the sun. - We can go to Deligny... - No, it's full of pick-up artists. It's an unbearable sight. It fills me with shame. And if a girl agrees to it, I'm sickened. Come on, they don't accost me every time. I wouldn't brag if I were you! I'm at the Caf? de la Mairie most afternoons. If you want to stop by... Maybe. - Well, goodbye! - Goodbye! The lunch I dreaded actually went rather well. I must admit the kid's improving. My bias against her is on the wane. That won't do! What are these flies doing in the embrocations? In what? The ointments, the creams... Can't we insert this illustration? I already told you, it's impossible. It's very annoying. Think about my proposition, it is reasonable, isn't it? You'll sell them all! I guarantee you! I'll think it over. I'm counting on you, Mr. Costal. Goodbye. Authors! They get more pretentious with age! He wants a first printing... of 1,500 copies of "Dressing Intimately." "I'll be lucky if I sell 300," I said. Unruffled, he replied: "1,500 seems reasonable to me!" "My name is often mentioned these days!" You bet! When he goes to a caf? his waiter greets him: "Ah, Mr. Petitzon, what'll it be today?" How pretentious! How did your date go? Rather well. I wonder... I don't know... But perhaps she does fancy me a bit. Let's say she doesn't dislike me. What makes you think so? It's just intuitive but I can see... even though she doesn't say much she's warming up to me. - We almost hit a snag! - How so? Perhaps as a test, she suggested a swimming pool. And you refused? Can you picture me in a bathing suit? A rented one? Too big or too small... with her in a tiny 2-piece suit... splashing about... with a cap on her hair! Well, you might've caught a glimpse... Precisely! I'd rather think she hides unforgettable qualities: magnificent skin, wild sensuality. How can you fantasize... if someone you don't care for bares it all? - Authors! - No, she's not the case. When will we meet again? I have no faintest idea. Leaving her at the pool without setting a date was risky. I'm afraid she didn't get my hint about the caf?... or didn't take it seriously. True, my manner hadn't been very engaging. In other words, let's call it sabotage. Let's call it sabotage... Until the damsel made contact... I decided to stick to my routine... and to go to the caf? as usual... increasing neither the frequency, nor the duration of my stays. In short, to behave absolutely normally. Saturday, April 14. Sunday, April 15. Ewa? Monday, April 16. Hello, Monique. Are you leaving already? My husband's waiting downstairs. Any messages for me? I don't think so. Were you expecting some? No, but someone might've called. - Are you staying? - No, I'll walk you down. - Where are you going? - To a restaurant. - With whom? - With my husband, I told you. Antoine? It's almost a week since we parted and still no sign of her. "Discreet," indeed! I'm afraid my story's come to a dead point. I have to wait. It's her move now. Or I may call her in a few days. Here you are! Bad timing. I'm leaving to do an appraisal in Orleans. Manu! Go check on the taxi. - When did you call it? - They said in 5 minutes. - So where are we? - In limbo. Since the other day? Nothing. When I saw her last, I told her I was often at my caf?. I went there to no avail. How long do you plan to just wait? I don't know. Maybe a few more days... I'll see. Sure, you'll see! It's not up to me to call, it's up to her. That's what I decreed. Decreed? Here's my taxi. - What does it matter? - Nothing. Carry on the way you do. It'll be a different story... less glorious. Duller and shittier! You have to act now, Antoine! I'll be back tomorrow morning. Call me or drop by. Friday, April 18. Hello. May I sit down? I'm imposing again! How rude of me. Are you expecting someone? No, I came to see you. I'm going to my parents'. I wanted to see you before then. - Are you busy tomorrow night? - No, I don't think so. Maybe we could go to a movie? A movie? Yes, if that's what you like. You're always available. As if you had nothing to do. Do I give the impression that I have nothing to do? On the contrary, it's the others who do nothing. Worse, most of them work at useless jobs. Even me? Do you know why they think... the time they spend on useless chores is work? No, but I'm about to find out. Because they get paid for wasting their time. In fact, they get paid for their silence. What if I paid you for your silence? I'm not that easily bought! - Want to try? - Try what? To be silent for a bit. - What for? - To see if you can. Of course, I can! Then hush! One minute of silence. I'll tell you when you can talk again. Go! Funny! It reminds me... Hello! Please sit down. - No, I can't... - Sit down for a second... Sorry. Meet Catherine... Solange. Nothing to say to me? Yes. I'm leaving Paris. Where to? I was offered a job in Roubaix. Same thing? Contemporary art exhibits? Same thing. And you'll live in Roubaix? Partly. Alone? For now, yes. And that guy? - What guy? - From the station. Is he also from Roubaix? He lives in Paris. Nice. You'll be commuting between Paris and Roubaix? If my work requires it, yes. I didn't mean your job. I got it. What are you doing, Catherine? Leaving you two alone. Please, stay. I have to go. You're writing again, I see. So to speak. Is it going well? Are you pleased with it? Pleased with it? People always think writers are pleased with their work... when most of the time we're too absorbed to enjoy anything! Do you know what's on my mind right now? How I shall write down this conversation tonight. I may then go to bed pleased with what I wrote. Then read it again in the morning and deem it a total shit. At times, I envy the man who cozily works his 8-hour shift... comes home, slippers on, has dinner, watches TV... maybe screws his wife... and goes to sleep. I think he's right, he's the norm. For happiness is not in being witty... but in ignorance and stupidity! He may say this today but the opposite tomorrow. Such as "The best thing in life is to take interest in everything... and the most fun is in learning." He says whatever suits him whenever it suits him. Right? Have you known him long? Not very. When you do, you'll stop to pay attention to what he says. He talks and talks... He's good at bending your ear. I bet he told you his theory on women in pants. No. He hasn't? I'm surprised. It's one of his classic routines. You have a theory on women in pants, Antoine? Yes. I've never told you? No, I'd have remembered. Well, remind me to tell you. You can count on it. Well... I'm going to buy my newspaper. Do you need anything? - Do you want a ride? - No. OK. - I can't stay any longer. - Stay! I'll be leaving in 2 weeks. Do you want the apartment? No, no. As you wish. - Bye! - Bye! Bye, Antoine! Actually, Solange and I lived together for a long time. We split up because she disappointed me. We agreed that whoever got bored first would tell the other. I told her: "If you want to date another man..." "let me know in advance." It's not always possible. Indeed, it rarely is. - She didn't warn you? - No. What irks most is not so much knowing you're second to someone else... What's more legitimate than being tired of someone? I too often felt that way myself, so I understand the others. What's distressing is to realize... that in hiding the truth, the other thought you wouldn't notice... thereby taking you for an idiot. You say that because you can't bear to see her going elsewhere. Men have affairs but so can women! One guy isn't always enough. You know, Catherine, you're completely immoral! I don't think so. Are you that way, too? Flitting about, left and right? - So how did you do it with her? - What? To find out. Did you go through her purse? Did you spy on her? No, I surprised them. - Want to tell me? - I don't want to talk about it. Let's change the subject. Let's talk about you. We never discuss you. I know nothing about your life or your loves. Do you have a love life? No. Dating anyone? - No one. - How is it? Not too bad. Wait, let me guess... You're coming out of a terrible affair... That's it. You're coming out of a terrible affair... You worshipped a man who didn't love you... You went through a great emotional disappointment... And that man doesn't love you... and you're extremely unhappy. Is that it? Would that surprise you? Actually, it was the other way around. I walked out, I got bored. Really? When I was in London, a lady hired me as an au pair. And I had an affair with her husband. At first, it was fine. We made love all the time. He loved it, and I liked it, too. Then he started taking it too seriously. He wanted to leave his wife. I thought he was in love with me. But it wasn't what I wanted. So I quit and returned to Paris. One night, the night before you picked me up at work... he tried to call me. He'd found my number. I told him not to bother... but he kept calling, so I had to change my number. Maybe you tried to call me then. No, I didn't. I thought you might have. You got your car? Yes, I have my old car. Can you drive me to work? I'm running late. There. I didn't get it: do you teach or study? Here I teach twice a week. Good. Well... Bye! Goodbye, Catherine. See you tomorrow? Yes. See you tomorrow. It's Catherine. Hello, Jean. Here you are. I was beginning to worry. Come on in. - Did you get my message? - What message? - I left the message with Ewa. - She didn't tell me. Well... What's it about? Nothing in particular. I just wanted to hear from you. She didn't tell me. So you were just coming by? I was just coming by. Well... Very good. Excuse me. I'm in a meeting. Just wait 5 minutes. When will I get the new draft? I don't know. By the end of the month. The end of the month. Fine. But remember what I said! In your hands is potentially a tremendous book. A great idea! Original content! Superb writing! Absolutely! Your style is magnificent! You have lots of talent. Which is quite rare. If you saw the stuff I read! It could be a great book, but change the ending. It's no good. Don't you agree? Well, it could be better. I'm not asking for the moon! Please. Well, not the moon! Antoine? Excuse me. Antoine! Did you like it? And you? Not bad, is it? I'll take you home? Not yet. Do you want to walk a bit? If you'd like. I'd like to walk along the Seine. The banks will be too crowded. You don't want to? We can drive there. Do you want to go on a boat ride? On a boat? You don't want to? No, the dock is too far and the weather is bad. The dock on Pont-Neuf isn't far. I don't want to. What strange tastes you have... The other day you tried to drag me to a pool, tonight it's a boat ride. You're very provincial after all. I really wonder what I'm doing with you! You don't like anything! What do you mean? It's not true! - Are we going to stand here all night? - No. I want to take you... to a very special place for a drink. Would you like to? Were you really that keen on that boat ride? Leave me alone. Thank you, sir. Go on, taste it! Do you like it? Do you? Yes. Look how beautiful this place is, Catherine. It's unique in Paris. Look at these couples. I won't even mention those behind you, they're totally... they're sexless. I love this place. Give me a smile or I'll think I'm boring you and you hate me. Will that do? One day, early in this century... on board a train, Tristan Bernard... do you know him? A great playwright, a wonderful writer... Tristan Bernard was taken to task by a passenger... in a first-class compartment. There was a lady, too. The passenger resented Bernard's smoking his pipe... in a non-smoking car. "You could at least have asked for the lady's permission!" Bernard didn't respond and kept on smoking his pipe. The passenger got upset and threatened to call the stationmaster at the next stop. Dead silence... as Bernard remained mute. The train pulled in... The passenger called the stationmaster... and reported Bernard's impropriety. Smoking in a non-smoking car, without a permission... and demanded an explanation. Then Tristan Bernard turned to the statiomaster and said: "You'd better ask the lady why she's in 1st class..." "with a 3rd-class ticket." Embarrassment in the compartment... The pipe was forgotten. With the company's interest at stake, the stationmaster... demanded to see the lady's ticket, it was indeed for 3rd class... He asked to get out. The train pulled out. Picture this: the train pulled out... Tristan Bernard remained alone with the passenger. "How could you do... "such a thing to a lady?" "And how could you possibly know she had a 3rd-class ticket?" Tristan Bernard replied: "Because it's the same color as mine." Please, Catherine, be quiet! Hush! People will stare! Not so loud! Be quiet, Catherine! I'd like another. You're a strange girl. Why? Because you, who adore lies... - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. You let me tell those absolutely authentic anecdotes... which, because they're true, should horrify you. I never said I liked lying. Only yesterday you said... I never said that. You only hear what suits you. I said, in some cases, when truth may hurt it's better to say nothing. Do you always tell the truth? You never lie? I have an idea. Let's do an experiment. Look me right in the eyes. What for? Let's pretend I'm your English lover. And I ask you to swear that you've never lied to me... and you've loved only me. I want to see your face when you lie. - What should I say? - That you've loved only me. - In English? - No, in French. Wait, I'll try not to laugh. I've loved only you. Say it again. You're my only love. It's scary. You're irresistible. Now you say it. - No, I can't. - Come on, Antoine! OK, give me a second. I need a minimum of concentration. I've loved only you. You're cheating! What do you mean? I did my best. I just don't have your talent. You didn't play the game. It's you who's the perfect liar... and I'm the cheat? Careful, it's liquor! No, not my glass! - A sip for your thoughts. - Precisely. This stuff's not for young girls. What do you know about girls? Not much, but I learn more every day. Give me your glass. No, leave it, Catherine! You're unbearable! At first you intimidated me. I could barely speak to you. I felt constricted. I was afraid I'd sound silly. I wondered why'd you want to see me. I thought: "Just another one who wants to screw me." It seemed odd for a guy like you to be interested in a girl like me. After all, I'm not your type. What do you think now? You don't give me that impression anymore. You're like everybody else. - Don't say that! - Yes, what did you think? I thought I wasn't like everybody else. You look sleepy. Do you want to leave? Do what you want with me. You're turning into a wanton. I'll take you home. Let's go, Miss Catherine! Please try! Here, take your bag. It's hideous! Good night. Will you be alright? - Are you sure? - Yes. - Remember your code? - Yes, yes. You don't look like you do. What's the number? 65...A...14. See you when you return? It'll be difficult. I don't have much time between my classes. - Yes, but we can still meet? - Maybe. I tire rather quickly of people. At first I'm attracted because I'm curious. When I see them again, I'm often disappointed. And you? I don't know. And you... you never seem to need anyone. My place is a mess. Will you wait? - Of course. - I'll be right back. Come in now. What were you doing there? It's silly. I felt like going for a walk... and I closed the door by mistake. - I didn't mean to wake you up. - Come in. I'm sorry. - The front door is locked. - I didn't know it. - I'll give you the key if you want. - But I don't want to go out. I'm going back to bed. I'm cold. Aren't you coming? No, I'm not sleepy. I'll just sit here and wait until dawn. I just want to... make some notes. May I take your notepad? Don't mind me. Are you writing your memoirs? Antoine! You can't sit there all night. Come to me. I don't want to disturb you. Come to warm me up. So you're cold... You don't want to? Antoine! Antoine! What is it? Come to join me. Alright. Hurry up. Hurry up? Yes. I want to be with you. My feet are cold. Can I put them with yours? Yes. - Are they too cold? - No, it's alright. I'm very sensitive to cold. When I was little... I'd always put my feet on the belly of whomever I slept with. It was so good. It went like this. They're so cold. - Can I tell you a story? - Yes. It's something I've never told anyone. Promise to keep it to yourself? I swear. - Promise? - Yes! Here goes... It happened when I was still in London. It's a little weird and so unlike me... but it's part of me... That's the way I am. One day a girlfriend told me she made money... as a night hostess in a pub. She vaguely told me how it had happened. I kept thinking about it. I wanted to know more. I looked for "Seeking Girl" ads and I called. A very proper lady answered. She said she'd see me. I wasn't sure I wanted to go anymore... but I saw it as a challenge to myself. If I could do this, I could do much more in my life. So I went there. The owner said she was glad I was French. Her clients liked foreigners, accents turned them on. That night I went back in one of my slightly sexier dresses. Three other girls were there. They were about my age. They worked there full-time. They were very young but they looked older than me. Maybe that's why I wanted to act like them. Carry on like a woman which they knew how to do and I didn't. Then I asked them questions. I asked them what we were to do since the owner hadn't been too clear. Should we kiss the clients? Should we give them head? Were we to perform some erotic tricks? But they wouldn't talk about it. I think I shocked them. I told them all they had to do was simply explain it to me. They weren't much clearer. Then very soon, a guy between 60 and 70 came in. He was fat and horrible. He was sweaty all over and smelled awful. I thought: "If I can make it with him, then I'm really strong." But another girl grabbed him. She ordered champagne and took him into a booth. We only heard the sounds. He said he'd be "a naughty little boy." I think he pinched her, too. Then I think he got down on all fours... and sort of licked her all over for 10 minutes. Then the girl got up and left. Still, I'd done nothing, it all seemed pretty easy. Then the phone rang. The owner said Mr. Machin was coming with his friends, we were to be ready. Then they arrived. Major hullabaloo! I thought they'd throw us on the seats... kiss us all over, stuff like that. Not at all! They were rather shy. So I mustered up some courage, went over to a guy... and started asking him questions. He didn't like it, so he went to another girl. He kissed her at once and laid her on the sofa. But still, nothing was happening to me. I looked around and noticed a guy who was just there... and I started talking to him. I quickly realized he hadn't come to cop a feel with a young girl... but wanted to talk. Later he tried to kiss me but I said I wanted to wait awhile. All around, the girls were being groped and pawed... or had tongues rammed down their throats. Some danced, others were under the tables. In order to put up with all that... the girls' goal was to infantilize these men... and treat them like they were kids. The men played the game. It was strange, a man of his age... He was 40. Handsome. He was sitting there next to me. It was very friendly. But I never could have physically... You have nothing to say? What's on your mind? Nothing. "Antoine, I didn't want to wake you up," "You look so charming in your sleep," "Just slam the door when you leave," "See you later. Kisses. Catherine." Want some brandy in your coffee, Manu, to shake you awake? Are you sure you don't? I'm buying. Your boss is coming. He's not my boss. Hello! Hi, Antoine! A cup of coffee. Over there, please. - Sure. - Have coffee with me, Manu? With a little milk. The milk's for Manu, I bet. Right, Manu? Does he always treat you like this? Yes, every morning. There's something I've often wanted to ask you. How long have you known Jean? 12 years. Why? And you've always been with him? Yes. You've never looked for work elsewhere? Oh, sure! One day I even quit. My sister owns a small caf? by the seaside. She offered me a job, so I went. Less than 2 weeks later, Jean came over to get me. So... I came back with him. Actually... Jean's a rather unhappy guy. When his mother died he wouldn't sell a thing. He told me I could stay at her place... but I couldn't touch or move anything. Sometimes he just comes by... he takes a chair... and just sits there silent, for hours. All alone. Have you seen the time? I met Antoine and he bought me a drink. Did he come back with you? He was in a hurry so he gave me this. Asshole! Did he say anything? Is he coming by? No, he didn't say. Was he a bit strange? How did he behave? No, he was very nice. You never notice anything! Don't stand like an idiot! Clean up this mess! Look at this! And that! What is this? Have you seen my address book? Watch the store. I'll be right back. Hello. Is Miss Catherine Legeay there? - Hold on, please. - I'll wait. Miss... I'm not mistaken. I recognized you at once. Antoine's description's quite accurate. That's what I'd like you to do... Is your train leaving now? Yes, it is. Send it back to me at this address. - Sorry for being late... - My train... I had trouble getting this manuscript back. Odeon... My train... Paris, the 6th district... Promise? Can I count on you? Yes. - Here. - Thanks. Wait, let me help you. You'll see, it should be easy. It's a short text. Your work is much appreciated! Thank you. "Dear Antoine," "Waking you up just to say goodbye seemed pointless." "So goodbye, Antoine!" "You'll understand the charm of our encounter lies in its brevity." "Meeting again would be a mistake." "I'm sure you see it the same way." "I hope this letter will dispel a misunderstanding..." "and put an end to an artificial situation." "Rest assured, however, that you retain my esteem." "Thanks again for that evening, it allowed me to know you better." "Wishing you good luck and success," "Cordially yours, Catherine." There are certain encounters in our life, there are dates and moments that mark you forever. I recall this episode from Restif de la Bretonne's life. Not far from this very caf? he approached a girl... Her name was Rose, she was a milliner. He saw her crossing the St. Sulpice square... and dared to speak to her despite his shyness. He also kept some sort of a diary. Without this detailed account of his life... we'd known nothing about that day in September of 1768... when Nicolas, a poor author and printshop worker, encountered love. Absorbed by his writing... Antoine didn't notice the young woman sitting in front of him. Even if he had, he'd have known nothing about her. When you look at someone, you only see half of them.
