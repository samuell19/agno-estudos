He's almost done. You're doing just fine. Thanks, it's not so bad. Well, one last push. -You're ready? - I think so, Dr. Guy. All right. Doctor? Yes, Patty? I think there's a little more Where? Well, I guess there was. That should be it. - Thank you so much, Dr. Guy. -I feel like a whole new person. -It was my pleasure. I insist. What happened? Nothing. You sure you don't want to talk about it? Guy's just being really difficult this morning. Probably nervous today. -Why? - The patent examiners are coming. No, they're not coming today. -He didn't tell you? -Hello? I believe it's my turn to be seen now. -Sir? -You just called my name. Sherman, Eugene Sherman. No Sir, go sit down. Well, don't call my name if you're not ready. -He's been doing that all day. -What's going on? The patent examiners are coming back. -No. -Why is that a problem? Because last time didn't go so well. If they are coming, I'm done here. Well, they're definitely coming soon. What happened last time? This happened. This machine is dangerous. -He says it's ready now. -He said that before. Okay, let's just get my last day over with. -Yes Ma'am. -Thank you. Now seeing Carol? Are you sure you don't want to see Mr. Sherman? I thought I heard another name. Maybe there's a mix up. -I'm Carol. -Miss Carol, please follow me. Please have a seat, Sir. Won't take long. How are you doing? I'm doing okay, thank you very much. Weather's a bit cold, but can't complain. Thanks for coming in today. We'll get you fixed right up. -Thanks so much. -You're welcome. -After you. -Thanks. Please have a seat. I'll need to do a routine checkup before we get started. Okay. Tammie said you've got a small spot on your neck. Yes Ma'am, I do. Let's have a look at it. I think my boyfriend might have left me because of that. Oh no. Then this boy wasn't worth it. You're beautiful inside and out. -It's a sebaceous cyst. -Oh no. No no, it's non-cancerous, so you'll be just fine. And Dr. Guy's a specialist for this, so you're in good hands. like Let me brief him quickly and I'll be right back. Sounds just fine. I'll be right back. Laser creates a clean incision on the area. I've tested it on numerous test subjects. -Like rats? - No, human tissue, son. Right, of course. You think you might do it for me today? I mean, yeah sure. I might even hire you full time. Oh gosh, that would be great. I could really use the extra money right now. Let's just don't talk about that yet. You can't put a price tag on experience. We need to talk. -Okay. -Alone. Preston, could you give us a minute? Yeah, sure. How could you? -What? -You know. Okay, relax Patty. It's gonna work this time. I told you if you ever use this machine again, I quit. Well, if you feel that way, we'll do fine without you. The intern's working out just fine. I mean it. Look, I am sure someone else will come along and want to take you. Just remember to file that paperwork. You're gonna need it. I can't believe you. Well, you might want to start. See in our next patient, Patty. This is a good one. Nice and juicy. Could you feel that? Barely. I think Patricia said it was a bodacious cyst. Is that true? I just want to make sure it isn't cancerous. Sebaceous cyst. I'm sorry she told you the wrong name. Look, it's nothing to worry about. We'll get this out sooner than later, okay? Okay. Did she tell you today is her last day? Oh, no she didn't. I'm really sorry to hear that. We are, too. We are, too. Can you feel that? How was that? -Not to bad. - Well... Carol, on a scale of one to 10, how would you rate it for pain? Probably a four. Four? I'm afraid that's high for this type of procedure. I'm afraid it's gonna get a lot more painful. If that's the way it feels now. It is. Carol, I would like to offer you an exclusive, that I do for certain patients... with this type of pain tolerance. Okay. I've invented a machine that virtually performs this operation pain-free and it removes a cyst, just like... that. I call it "The Get Gone". Thank you so very much, Dr. Guy, but I really think I'm good. Well I insist that you think about this, because it's much healthier for you. And if you're worried about a little scarring, I've got a little special cream for that. Oh, I... yeah, I appreciate the offer. We'll even offer it half price. -Thank you, that's very generous. -I'll slice the cheese even more. This is starting to feel uncomfortable. -Well, what if... -She said no. Okay. Let's just do it the old fashioned way, the more expensive way, the less efficient way, the less practical way, and the much more painful way. Now... let's get started. Well, how was that? I think you just caught me by surprise a little bit. -Well, you want to use the "Get Gone"? -Oh, no! Wow, there's a little bit more in there than I thought. Okay, go get Clarence to clean this mess up. Thank you very much, Patty. Hey Carol, today's Patty's last day. -Can you believe that? -Yeah, you already told me. Clarence. Sorry, guys, this dang bucket. For the love of God, can't you see I'm operating? Every time this dang guy. Patty, we are all excited now, because Peter is our new intern. Preston. He's gonna take Patty's place. We are so excited, because he's gonna pop some life into this area. -Aren't ya, boy? -Yeah, sure. Patty, let's let Preston do the stitches today. I know it's his first time, but you're okay with that, aren't you, Carol? Um, I... Well, you wouldn't have to use stitches, if you used "The Get Gone". But, but... Oh, I like that one too. Patty, the patent examiners are supposed to be here any minute and Carol was supposed to be our test subject, but that didn't happen. -So I was wanting to know, if you guys would... -No! No what? -If you think I'm letting... -I figured you'd back out. -Good thing we got trusty Peyton. -Preston! -Preston. -Well, what about you, boy? You got anything against saving people's lives. I mean, I don't, I don't. -I don't... -You can do it. I don't, I don't. You can do it. - I won't let you down, Doctor. -That's what I like to hear. Patty, go out and welcome our guests to the front. Let's find us a growth. You're okay? Well, it looks like today's my last clay here. At least one of us is getting out of here alive. I've got a bad feeling about this. What are you saying? -He's different. -Like losing his mind? He lost that a long time ago. True. Me? -No. -Dang. That looks a little small. I thought it was acne. Do you have any other spots, that don't know about? None that I'm aware of. Ok. I'm gonna put some treatment on this, to make absolutely sure we get the full potential of "The Get Gone". What do you mean? I'm gonna grow this, so that it gets bigger. Small price to pay to get you down the history books. I just want to keep my job, Sir. Well, keep it up. You might not have to worry about working again. Heck, you might even get paid if you're lucky. Ow! I don't think that you would listen. Well, this whole thing is wrong. You are wrong. Oh, hello Patricia. It is so nice to see you again. Della,... AI. Thanks for coming in today. Bill. Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Patricia. Oh, it's just Miss. Pleasure to meet you, too. Let's just get this thing started and over with. -Shall we? -Me? Right this way. So what is different about his machine this time? He's making changes all the time. Does it work? -Last time it was a disaster. -I'm sure he's made improvements. Well, I hope so because this is his last chance. Patricia, can you explain the device? The machine is supposed to make skin removal operations less painful, more efficient, and affordable. Well, that could, that's it, that could cut down the use of metal tools and certain infections. I mean it would dramatically... raise the health code scores up... for all general practices. That's the idea. Oh my gosh. It is so good to see you again. Thank you all so much coming. -Guy. -It means the world to me, from the bottom of my heart. But I do have some terrible news today. It's Patty's last day. My condolences to Patricia, but we need to get this thing moving, because we need to get out of here. -I thought we had all morning. -No no, we talked about this. -We did. -More than twice. One hour and we are out. -Out the door. - I was just gonna say. This all like last -Not like last time. -The clock starts... now. Okay. Well this new version of "The Get Gone" works so well, that our trusty intern here, Presto, has volunteered to be our patient today. He'll be explaining... the machine. -Presto? -Yeah, ah... -Presto, just read it. - Yes, this... This an interstellar processor, a warp combabulator. -A warp what? -Combabulator. And a thermite compactor. You wanna follow along a little bit more'? Just read this, it's great information. This -Yes. -This... I'm gonna do it again. This... This new unit features a patented. That's not patented yet. Look, this is "The Get Gone", patented vulcanized, hypervacuum. Not patented. That sucks the infected area down the glide tube into the patented antinuclear sack. -It's not patented. -It's not patented. Pending. Look, I got to work on this machine. Patty, just read this. Why get upset, when you can got "Get Gone". When you got a cyst as big as a fist, "Get Gone". When you got a growth you've grown to loathe, "Get Gone". That was amazing. Thank you so much, Patty. -She really wanted to do it. -No I didn't. This is the area, we'll be working on today. That thing's a lot smaller than last time. Much smaller. I'm not getting a patent on a cyst. We just want to see it work on something larger. I mean, you can remove that with tweezers. This isn't life threatening. Okay, let's talk about the machine. Let's talk about the damn machine! Doctor, you might want to give it a second before. -What's happening? -I must've held the buttons too long. No, your machine went kaputz on its own. It's a failure again, Doc. Listen, we're out of here. I don't have time for this. And I don't want to get any more your sob story letters, we're done. The power converter needs a nuclear fuse and we still have 45 minutes. -We are outta here. -Look, you're wasting time now. We really need to go. I pay my damn taxes and I'm gonna get my 45 minutes. Patty, take them next door to the diner. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Sorry about that. Well, I'm not gonna say "no" to a free lunch. I remember this place from last time. Guess this trip won't be a total bust. The sausage is great. Biscuits and gravy, that's what I'm doing. I wonder, if they have grits. -Gross. -What, I've never tried grits before. Consider yourself lucky. I'll have grits with you, Bill. Of course, you do. -What can I get for you guys? -We're sort of in a rush. We need one order of B and G's, fruit, two orders of grits, sausage, and two eggs sunny side up and four coffees. -Thank you. -Wow. Aren't you special? Sorry that Dr. Guy's being a little bit cranky today, but I think he's just nervous. -It's your last day, isn't it? -Yes, it is. Bet you're happy. So what are you gonna do now? I might start selling my own jewelry. You make jewelry? I'd love to see something you've designed. Dr. Guy's wearing a copper bracelet around his wrist. I made it for him. I'll check it out. So, you're getting out of the health field. Well, I might go back someday. Sometimes a change of scenery does wonders. I think that's really smart. Thank you, Bill. So, Patricia, is there anything you want to tell us before we go back over? I mean, Guy's been throwing himself into this machine for years. And frankly I've never seen a need for it. Never seen a need for it, especially after what happened to you the last time. Yeah, how's your arm? Couldn't be better, thanks. Wait, what happened? -Well, if you don't mind me asking. -Maybe we shouldn't bring it up. No, it's fine, really. Last time Dr. Guy got a little bit too excited during the test and he turned the power up too high. Luckily, the machine turned off after a few moments. Did that laser incision leave any scarring? No, not at all. Oh, did I tell you the Dr. Guy began working on an ointment, that will rejuvenate damaged cells? Rejuvenate damage cells? We're gonna get a chance to see that today? No, that's definitely not ready yet. They wanted it bigger. They wanted it bigger! Dr. Guy? What are you doing? I'm getting my damn patent. That was delicious. Shall we? We don't have much time left. Oh, don't worry about the check. -It's on Dr. Guy. -Are you sure? Thank you. You know Patricia, since this is your last day and all, I think it's safe for me to say, that I think... I always thought Dr. Guy was a little crazy. I mean, what kind of guy obsesses over a machine like that? I know, I mean we see a lot of machines in our line, don't we, Della? We see a lot of machines, mostly food related, -I'll tell you what, this thing is... -Bizarre. -Bizarre, never seen anything like it. -Weirdest thing I've ever seen. -Well, you know what they say, it takes a crazy person to... -Change the world. -Who the hell says that? Well, I've been here for an eternity. Your appointment is at two o'clock. It's 12:20. That's not even early, that's just dumb. I need this thing off me now, or else I'm gonna walk out of here now. Thank goodness! Ready? -No. - No! Preston? Are you okay? Is something wrong? That's who I feel. Now where's my lunch? What? My stomach's so dang empty. Where is it? -I didn't know... -Get on with it, what? I didn't know you wanted me to bring your lunch. -Didn't know? -No. You didn't know, did you? You didn't know. Well, don't worry. I'm just fine. Last day. Gonna miss you so much. Well, well, well. I hope you all had a nice lunch, 'cause you know what? I didn't get one. But today is the day, 'cause you're gonna come here and see what you've all been waiting for. Patty? Please show our guests to their seats. Patty, get to it. Guy, you got five minutes and we are out of here. Out the door. Well, great! Great! Are you okay with that? Five minutes? Is it big enough... now? What is it? What is it? - Patty? -Uh, huh? Do the blessing. Do the blessing, Patty. Okay. Do the blessing. Do the song blessing quickly! (Patricia humming) -Quiet, quiet. Stop it! As you can see,... the laser is working. Pugsley, how does it feel? It hurts. Great! I'm going to turn it up to three. You have one minute left, Guy. Turn it off! -Turn that thing off! -Doctor! It's stuck to the center. Turn it off! No! Do something, do something! Oh my God! Time's up, Guy. We're out of here! This time I'm shutting you down for good. What have you done? You know, it wasn't ready. I'm getting that patent. What the? That's it, I'm outta here. Adios. Ew! It's gone. It's gone! Is this on the doors too? -Just hold on, Patty. -But why? Just I did a little lockdown procedure, that's all. -With a way out? -Just relax, Patty. When the clock hits five, I'm out. Hey! Hey, hey I need some help here. Please can you help me? Come and give me some help. Look, it's not doing anything. It's just like sitting there. This is a doctor's office, right? Because it's your specialty, right? Come on, help me! Come on, help, I'll do anything! Your patent! -The patent? -Yes, I'll give you your patent. -Patent? -Help me. Help me. You gotta help me! Come on! -Clarence, where did you get that? -I'm sorry. Thought I was gonna be ready. All the doors and windows locked down? - Looks like it. -We are not breaking through that metal. It is made for nuclear fallout shelter. -He didn't build an exit? -I don't know. -You're kiddin' me? -What about the monster lady? -You want me to shoot her? -No! We just need to get that cyst off her. It's just a cyst. I think... I hope. Let's go! Put that down. -I need y'all's help. -Trust him? -I'm not going in there, you can. Come on. You're good. - We have to save him. - No, I ain't going. Okay, I'm going in. -I need your help. -I'm not, I'm not go. We going in here? Come on! Oh! Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa... "The Get Gone" is ready. -It's the only way. - Anything... anything, I'll give you your patent. Please, just get that thing off of me. -Can't we just cut it off? -Oh God, that is so stupid. Where'd you come up with that idea? That's why I'm the doctor and you're the receptionist. Really, you want to laser it off? Exactly. No, please. Please God, don't do that. Please, no. Am I dead? Clarence, that's not going to... Is it dead? Are you gonna clean that up? We're screwed. Yeah, she hadn't even given us a patent yet. Let's get that thing off. Just be careful this time. Vacuum off, laser on. Let's blast this thing. Oh, thank God. It worked. It worked! Oh, thank God. It worked. It worked. Oh Dr. Guy, as soon as I get out of here, I am gonna sign that patent paperwork. You mean it? As I live and breathe. It worked! Shut your stupid mouth. People are dead right now. This is no time to think about your patent. Just tryin' to be positive. I think we made it angry. We need to trap it and come up with a plan. Yeah, yeah, yeah! -You get her? -Yeah, locked her in the closet. Good work, Clarence. Not sure I should have put her in there, but it's all right. It's all right. -Is there a problem? -No, no, no problem. Let's just get out of here. Is there an exit? -Not exactly. -What does that mean? It means no! You got any dynamite or anything else in here that we don't know about, that might actually help. The laser might be able to melt the door. It's not big enough. Couldn't we amplify it? What the hell? What the hell? What is this noise? I have a confession. I may have been stashing some sharp metallic utensils in that closet. Stashing? Amassing might be a better word. That's why I've been having to buy scalpels every week. Yeah, I'm a sculptor. You know how expensive metal supplies are. You're fired. If Patricia was leaving, I was gonna quit anyways. Oh, no! Hey! -Where's Clarence? - Probably just sculpting. No! What's happening? I don't know! Y'all just calm down. It'll be fine. I think it's gone. You sure? -Someone's out there. -Who? Darkness. -Bill? -Patricia? Patricia, is that you? -What are you doing? -You're not going out there. I can't see. Let me go, I'm not going to let him die. He's already dead. It's a cyst monster acting like Bill. Bill!? Bill! Okay, fine! You're the worst doctor ever! You're the worst nurse ever! This is the worst job, I ever had. Well good luck getting a referral from me. You're not leavin' me! Ooh! -I love you! -I hate you! Damn! Patricia? Patricia, are you in there? Hell, I'll do it. I'm coming to get you. If y'all wouldn't have been fighting, we probably could have saved him. -It's her fault. -What are gonna do now? We're gonna kill that thing. If we stay in this room any longer, y'all are gonna kill each other. Probably. How about we go up front, get as far away from that thing as possible? I already told her I love her, I'm not going out there. -Stop it! -Just shut up, I'm tired of hearing your mouth. You're sure, there's no way to reverse the lockdown? -Only in case of emergencies. - What? Fine, there's a breaker in the base with a reversal switch, but I'm not going down there. The doors don't work. I don't know, what else is down there. Oh, wait. So if I pull that switch, we can get out of here'? Of course. I'm not an idiot. All right. I'll go down. And after I hit that switch, I'll come back up. So please, Tammie, find a way to distract the cyst for our exit. -Got it. -Patty, if you need my help. Oh my God. Oh God! You should go check on her. -She'll be fine. -If you really love her, you should go. I only said that to win the fight. Look, you can't lie to me. I know what's going on. You're mad at her for leaving, and this is just payback. That's preposterous. Tammie? Go away! -You got a plan? -Not yet. You're hurt, aren't you? Maybe it just wants to be wanted... or loved. What? Come here, cyst. I know how you feel. All those days you just want some loving and no one wants you clinging on. I'm clinging too It just means we care a little bit more than others. Tammie, you know, that's a bad idea. No, Tammie. No! It's okay, he's not gonna hurt me. I can see it in his eye. You're not, what they think you are. Tammie. Come here, baby. See? It's working. A little closer. Tammie, no! No! No, fuckin' no! -Let me go! -No! Let me go! Come! "The Get Gone" is ready. Let's use it. But we have to find a way to amplify the laser and destroy the cyst. Well, all the tools are inside it. -What about your examiner? -It's over there in the cabinet. When the laser hits it, it will magnify the beam. -That can work. - Yes, it must work. -Patty? -Yes? Have you always hated me? No, it just took me so long to find out who you really are. It's coming! One of us will have to be in here with it. We can work this out. I'm sure we can. Open the door! Open the door, it's stuck! Last day. I'll miss you so much. No! No, please! Looks like you're gonna be out of here by five after all. Oh, no! Ah! Give that back! I insist! Get gone! Okay, here we go. Mark, please. Scene 28, Take 1, mark,. So long, suckers! George. -You're on screen. -Shit. -No, he's just a spectator. Leave him alone. -I didn't know that. I don't even know, what they are doing. Sorry. Wait! What? You know that very well. All good, that will relax. Relax? What is going to relax? I'm not going to relax. -No? -No, I just... The early bird, ma'm. I'm the early bird. -Which one, the cuckoo bird? -Oh you think I make jokes? But with a bowling ball in the neck, you become immune to insults. You're lucky. Okay, Doctor. Oh man, stop it! That accent! That accent! Dr. Guy? Not patented! That accent! Where does it come from? I've never heard it before. I know your lies, Dr. Guy. You got to be good. Just go to a happy place and you'll be fine, okay? Everything is correct. Alright? You're gonna feel right. I'm turning it up now... Oh, am I dead? Kiss me! No! Yes! No! Yes! I'm getting that patent. They're filming me! And then they're going wrap. Oh, my God!!! Not patented? All these years! All these years! -I love you! -I hate you! -I hit my head, but it's okay. -Fine. Okay, now do the one with the lasagna. -The what? -The lasagna one. -You're just making fun of me. -Oh, yeah. I don't care. All right. Toss the lasagna! Get gone, motherfucker! One, two, three... No. Again, please. Sorry. Sorry, guys. Okay! One, two, three. -No! -My patent! My patent! We are ready. Get up, here. Take four, mark! -I thought, it looks better slow. -It's pretty awsome.
