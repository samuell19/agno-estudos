I suggest you wait here, Marcy. I'll be back shortly. [ Crash ] This is one of those times when your brother should be a civilian. All right, break it up! Attention! When I call attention, soldier, I mean attention. I'm Captain Whitlock. I've just assumed command of this post. Do we have a first sergeant here? Yes, sir. Sergeant McAfee, sir. All right, Sergeant. Every man in this barracks is confined to the post until further orders. Yes, sir.And, Sergeant, don't bother to sew those chevrons on too tight. Now where will I find the acting commanding officer? Lieutenant Sayre, sir. I'll see you in my office in one hour. That's all. At ease. [ Chattering ] Lieutenant Sayre reporting as ordered, sir. All right, Mr. Sayre, you're at ease. Now tell me, just what the devil was this all about? Well, sir, I guess the men just got tired of waiting for the war to get started... and decided to give it a little push... or settle it all by themselves. Just something they had to get out of their systems. There's nothing much out here to keep a man occupied when he's off duty. It don't take long before he's rucked up and sour as a contrary mule. We're discussing men, mister, not mules. And I won't have soldiers acting like ordinary drunked-up trash. Get that through your head.Yes, sir. Time may come, Lieutenant, when the North and South are at each other's throat. But as of right now, there's no war being fought. We're all in the same army. I'm glad you feel that way, sir. That's the way I expect every officer and man in this post to feel. If they don't feel it, they can act it. Now pass this on to the men. Any more brannigans like I saw here tonight, and I'll chill their toenails for sure, mister. Tell them that.Yes, sir. They get itchy nerves, let them go out and shoot a few Indians. That won't be necessary, Captain. The Navajos are in a friendly mood. Well, from what I've heard, the friendlier they are the less they can be trusted. You heard wrong, sir. I've known Menguito since I was that high. There's nothing two-faced about him. Menguito?The chief. One of your closer friends? That's right. A very close friend. All right, they can go out and hunt pack rats for all I care. Amounts to the same thing. That's all, Mr. Sayre. Send in McAfee. [ Screams ] [ Screams Continue ] What is it, ma'am? What happened? - Did you see him? - See who, ma'am? I-- Th-There was an Indian outside my window. Tried to break in. Well, don't stand there grinnin'. Do somethin'. Now don't go bustin' your stays, miss. I'll get your Indian. What's all the ruckus, Jed? Seems like somebody tried to ambush the lady. Lieutenant Chalmers, ma'am. Anything I can do? Just-Just don't leave me alone. Now that's what I call a real nice tour of duty, ma'am. Here you are, miss. Drink this. Better?Thanks. - [ Door Opens ] - [ Gasps ] This the savage that was about to scalp you? Relax, miss. He's harmless. A mighty good man to know if you ever get lost. He's one of the best scouts in the territory. Meet Joe Copper Face.Get him out of here! He won't bite you, ma'am.I said get him out! He just wants to make friends.Don't touch me! [ Door Opens, Closes ] Come on, Joe. Let's crawl back to our cages. Don't start racking her down, Jed. She's only a woman. What'd you expect her to do, kiss him? She can try acting civil. What are you men doing here at this hour? Where's Miss Whitlock?She had a bit of a fright, sir. Nothing serious. I believe you'll find her in her room. Marcy?Oh, come in, Lee. What is it, honey? What's wrong? Oh, everything. I can't stand this place, Lee. Well, I'll-- I'll admit it's nothing like home. But after we get it fixed up, it'll be--No. No, it's not just the house. It's that and everything else. The dirt, the cold, Indians sneaking around at night, rude officers. I just hate it, that's all. Officers? What did they do? He's like a nasty little boy chasing after girls with a dead mouse. Why-Why, he dragged that awful Indian in here as if he enjoyed tormentin' me. I'll be talking to him.Talking isn't gonna change him... any more than new curtains are gonna change this house. They're both mean at the core. Troop "A" all present and accounted for, sir. Troop "B" all present and accounted for, sir. All present and accounted for, sir. Dismiss the command. Dismissed. Oh, Mr. Sayre, just a moment. As ranking junior officer, you'll be taking over as adjutant. placing officers' row off limits to all Indian personnel. Off limits? Sir, if that's because of what happened last night-- I prefer not to qualify my orders, mister. Now I don't want to see them outside their quarters after lights out. And since they're classified as scouts, we can dispense with their presence at formation. Might just as well walk up and hand them a slap across the face. I don't propose to turn this into a debate on etiquette, Lieutenant. You have your orders.[ Man ] Lieutenant! Hello, Jed. Gotta a mighty dead prospector for you to mourn. Barney Lucker. When did it happen?Uh, couple, three days ago. Saw his mule wandering around loose in the foothills yesterday morning. That tipped us to get a search party out. Where'd you find him?In the Turkeys. What do you think, Jed? Those Injuns had about all the peace they can stand? I don't know just yet, Dan. Go ahead, Captain. I did it myself the first time I seen a man with his scalp off. You men take the horse.[ Chattering ] Looks like your buddy Menguito is in for a mess of misery, Lieutenant. How's that, Mac?They got the captain convinced the Navajos broke the peace. He's sending Copper Face out with an ultimatum.What kind of an ultimatum? The chiefs have till sunrise tomorrow to bring in the bucks who killed Lucker or else. I'm not turning my cheek. Point is, I don't think Barney was murdered by a Navajo or any other Indian. Well, how can you say that? Half the man's head was gone. You didn't see an arrow sticking in him, did you?Proving what? Proving this: An Indian may scalp a man, but he'll always sink an arrow in the body. It's a superstition. It's supposed to pin the spirit to the corpse... so it won't rise up and go haunting the guilty Indian or his friends. Well, that's very interesting, Lieutenant, but it hardly satisfies me. Then maybe this will. Barney was on a prospecting trip. Yet when they brought his body in there wasn't as much as an ounce of dust on him. His money belt was missing. No Indian in his right mind would murder a man for gold. More guesswork. That rancher could have lifted the gold, or somebody in the search party. I'm afraid I can't go on what you assume, Lieutenant. Then what can you go on?Facts. Don't be so touchy about your Indians. Your bare hands are clean. Nobody will try washin' them. Sometimes a little ambition makes people see dirt where there isn't any. Just what do you mean by that? Harrison won himself an Indian campaign and got elected president. That's all, Mr. Sayre. Some people just can't stand a little peace and quiet. Now the milk's spilt. Where you going? Someplace where I can buy myself a skinful. Don't go throwin' a wingding, Jed. Whitlock's out to make a name for himself. He'll have this outfit in a glory campaign if it's the last thing he ever does. [ Marcy ] Is that right, Mr. Sayre? Well, I didn't hear you knock, miss. You couldn't hear anything. You were too busy wagging your tongue. That's partly what the good Lord put it in my head for. Too bad he didn't put something in your spine while he was at it. Any man who'd sit around twiddling his thumbs... while savages go about scalping half the country-- Bye, now.Don't you walk out on me, Mr. Sayre. Frankly, miss, one Whitlock a day is enough for me. Why, you're not fit to polish my brother's boots. I hadn't planned on volunteering for that duty. And if the captain mentions it, I'll tell him what you said. Come on, Ben, it's getting thirstier by the minute. You know, if you two put off hating each other so much, you might find you like each other a lot. ♪ [ Guitar ] You boys smell somethin'? Sorry about Barney, Tom. Tough. Yeah, I'll bet. Must be all broke up. Have to go out and spank some redskins now. Tough on you soldier boys. We buried him outside the post. Wasn't much of a funeral though. None of his friends showed. All right, I don't like funerals. Do you mind? He was your friend. Poor old Barney. I open.[ Coins Clunk On Table ] Yes, sir, things in a stinkin' mess.♪ [ Ends ] A man never knows. Injun liable to hop him on Main Street at high noon. Trouble is we got too many soldier boys like Jed, not enough civilians like his old man. Yes, sir, old Rube Sayre, he knew how to handle them red devils. No, sir, it's no wonder Barney's dead. Look who's protectin' him. I tell you old Rube Sayre had the idea. Get to them before they gets to you. Hey, amigo, play something loud. Hey, Tom.

When did you start prospecting, Tom? Been at it a long time. Maybe four years. Never got around to bankin' it?Gonna bank it today. That's how come I was wearin' it. Decided to bank it after four years, huh? Maybe on account of what happened to Barney's dust. Yeah, that's right. Don't want no Injun gettin' ahold of this. How'd you know Barney's dust was lifted? Nobody said anything about it. Well, uh, guess I-I thought, uh-- Where'd you pan it, Tom? Colorado. Got it in Colorado maybe four years ago. You're a liar. Colorado gold's red. It has copper in it. This is pure yellow. Local stuff. You killed Barney. Chopped his head open and took his dust. Cuttin' a big gut, soldier. Don't start what you can't finish.I can finish it. Take a look at his horse, Ben. If he's been in the Turkeys, the shoes will show wear. There will be sand loam packed under rims. Right. Why, you-- [ Panting ] Guess somebody better see about wakin' up the sheriff. What's up, Mac? Where is everyone? Pulled out right after assembly, sir.Didn't the chiefs show up? Did you expect they would? [ Spits ] Menguito sent the word back with Joe. Told Captain Whitlock what he could do with his ultimatum. Made the captain kind of mad. He lit out of here with a mind to read 'em the scriptures. Satisfied? Give me a hunk of that pigtail. If it's peace offerings you're takin', better get one for the captain while you're at it. He's sore as a boil about you two breakin' restrictions. Dismount! Take cover! Take cover! Take cover! Place those guns across the body off the slope! Hold the crest of the hill!No, Captain, no! Menguito does not make war! He's right, sir. They could have whittled us down to nothing by now. They're asking us to hold up here for a spell... and make it mighty clear what this visit's all about. They already know what it's all about. A white man was murdered and some Navajo is gonna pay for it. Relax. Dyin' ain't so bad. You've been doin' it since the day you was born. Yeah. I just wish I knew what I was aiming at. Sonny, if it moves and don't call you by your first name, shoot it. Can you get through to the chiefs? Well, take this message. If the Indian who murdered that white man isn't delivered to me in five minutes, I'm gonna open fire with my cannon. If he delivers that message, there's no backing out. We'll have a fight on our hands. Get going! Well, there goes a year of peace shot to blazes. Where the devil you been, Sayre? In Watrous, sir, hearing Tom Kehler confess to the murder of Barney Lucker. What?That's right, sir. Tom Kehler. He's a white man, not an Indian. Joe, come on back! It's all right! Come on back! You sure what you're saying?Ben and I turned him over to the sheriff this morning. All right, Mr. Fry, we have no more business here. Assemble the men and re-form the column.Yes, sir. Assemble! Re-form! I was just thinkin', sir, as long as we're here, it might be a good idea to have a little powwow with Menguito. I got nothing to say to him. Well, there's been a lot of muscle flexed here today. I'd hate to see him get the wrong idea. Let him make the most of it. Nobody's been hurt. Course, that's all up to you, sir, but I wouldn't want Menguito to get the notion... he'd made the cavalry turn tame and run for home. All right, Mr. Sayre. Let's have a look at your Indians. Not a kid or a squaw in sight. They meant business. Are we welcome here, Menguito? It is always good to see the face of a friend, Belinka. I kinda figured you'd be running short on pigtail. This is Captain Whitlock. He's the new soldier chief at Fort Union. Why do you come here? The lieutenant thought we should meet. It isn't right that leaders should be strangers. The captain wishes to be a friend. I have only heard his angry words accuse my people of killing. I have watched him enter our camp ready to make war. This is no sign of friendship. Yeah. Words were spoken in haste. They were wrong. Captain's ridden many miles to say he's sorry for sending them. If this is true, it takes but one tongue to say as much. Why are there so many soldiers, so many guns? Soldiers are like horses, they-- they grow soft and lazy without exercise. Do the guns also grow soft and lazy? With these eyes I saw them loaded and aimed at my people. Soldier chief thought your arrows were marked for war. A leader should be wise. A mistake anyone could have made. If he had his mind set on war, do you think he would have led his troops into an ambush... that even a child could have sensed? Isn't that right, Captain? That's right, Mr. Sayre. I would like to believe what you say is true. Ha![ Speaking Navajo ] Why, you thievin'-- [ Speaking Navajo ] He'll be whipped for what he's done. I'm sorry for this, Belinka. Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe now you'll realize that your own people can make mistakes too. All mistakes are bad things when war comes easy, and it is hard not to make them. But it will be harder for you than for me, because you are new in this land. Now I say this as a friend. You have great courage, but you have much to learn. Until you are wiser, seek counsel in this man. Listen to him well. It may be, Soldier Chief, that he has more wisdom than either of us. Then the peace is strong, Menguito? It will always be strong so long as there are men with clear minds who guard it well, Belinka. I'm afraid this fella didn't enjoy the ride so much, but I did. I'm much obliged for your company, Lieutenant. Pleasure, ma'am. Shall I see you to the stables? No, that won't be necessary. But would you tell the captain we're back, with our scalps on? He was a little worried about that.Certainly, ma'am. And rest! [ Sighs ] This don't make a lick of sense to me. What Injuns gonna stand there and let you chop on him with one of these overgrown razors? Ask Whitlock. This drill's his idea. I reckon that's the way they do things in Mississippi. I got a taste yesterday of the way they do things in Mississippi, and it darn near cost me my neck. No, thanks. I'll take a man like Lieutenant Sayre every time. Well, I'd sure feel a lot better if he was giving the orders and Whitlock was takin' 'em. That's for sure. Still looks shaky to me.I'm afraid you're right. Guess we'll have to retire him. Can I give you a hand down, miss?You can keep your hands off me. Suit yourself. Ohh! Must be the eastern way of gettin' off a horse. Interesting. [ Whinnies ] Don't excite him, ma'am. Might turn into a rough ride. Will you please help me? Why, I'd be happy to, ma'am. Ohh! You must take particular delight in trying to make fools out of people. Well, I sure been getting a lot of help lately. Bruised your fetlock, huh? Indian party approaching! Welcome to Union, Menguito.[ Navajo ] Belinka. Say, I thought we were supposed to be supplying you. Well, you have very good pigtail and flour. Not such good meat. Very bad blankets. You make us happy, we make you happy. That's a fair enough deal. ♪ [ Bugle Blows ] Well, it sounds like you're just in time for some of that not-such-good meat. Mac, see about feeding the others, will you? And tell the Q.M. we'll start issuing right after chow.Yes, sir. Let's get washed up and get some food. You see, Lee gave me my first pony when I was only 10 years old. Well, that explains why you ride so well. I believe you know everyone except the captain's sister. Miss Whitlock, Menguito. It is my honor. Your sister has much beauty. Thank you. Take my chair, Menguito. Well, wouldn't you know it. I forgot my medicine. Excuse me. I-- I'll be right back. Pleased with yourself?What are you talking about? Walking out like that.I believe it's my privilege to come and go as I see fit. Not when you've got an important chief for a guest, it isn't. He's your guest, not mine.I don't care whose guest he is. You insulted him and he knows it, and I don't like it. That's funny. I don't like to see my brother insulted either, but that never seemed to make any difference to you, did it? I figured you had something like that in mind. Look, if you got a score to settle with me, fire away. Make sure it's me you're aiming at. Think up a good excuse for taking this little stroll and get back in there. Listen carefully. I don't care if your friend is the most important chief in the entire West. To me he's just a redskin savage... and I can't stand the stench long enough to stay in the same room with him. That wasn't him. You just got a good whiff of your own soul. And, lady, all the perfume in the world wouldn't cover that up. Jed! I think I better see you to your quarters, ma'am.[ Panting ] Thank you for your kindness, Lieutenant. I-I'm all right now. In that case, I think there's something about Jed you ought to know. I don't want to talk about him. I don't suppose you've ever heard about the Sayre massacre. Used to be pretty famous in these parts. Happened when Jed was a kid, about eight or nine. His old man organized the whole thing. One night he rounded up a bunch of half-drunk vigilantes... and they set out to raid a Navajo camp. Wasn't any need for it either. Them Indians had been at peace for over two years. They were sleeping when it happened. Never got a chance to get their blankets off. I tell you, ma'am, it wasn't a fight. It was just plain slaughter. Oh, that's awful. Ask Jed how awful it was. You mean he was there? His old man dragged him along. Figured it was time he started learning how to handle redskins. Nine years old. Yeah. And he saw enough in that bloodbath to last him a lifetime. Babies killed. Squaws getting cut to pieces. His old man acting like it was fun. You don't even want to hear about it, but Jed's had to live with it. Never could get it out of his mind. It was like just being there made him as guilty as the others. That's why he's so touchy, ma'am, about the way people treat the Indians. He's never stopped trying to make it up to them. Oh, and about your brother. He'd probably be dead today if it wasn't for Jed doing some fast thinking. Jed. Beg your pardon, miss.Jed. Mr. Chalmers told me everything, about what happened with your father? And what you did for my brother. Jed, try and believe me. I am sorry. I believe you. And, Jed? Jed, there's something else. We've been fighting ever since we met. I wasn't sure why. I only know I wanted to hit out at you. Hurt you if I could. I know why now. Lee? Lee. Well, what is it? What does it mean?I don't know. I don't know. War, maybe. A step closer anyhow. Well, there can't be a war now. There just can't be. Gentlemen, you can count on war within a month. The moment war is declared, the Confederacy will strike through Texas into New Mexico. The plan calls for a swift, decisive victory in this territory. Then a campaign in Arizona and finally California. If the strategy succeeds, the South will not only have vital ports, but, more importantly, it will have cut the Union's lifeline-- the gold supply. Considering that uniform, General Stone, you have a most amazing knowledge of the Confederate's plans. The uniform has its conveniences, but it can be shed in a minute. Grantin' what you say is true, aren't you taking a risk passing such information around? Not to you gentlemen. I've known your sympathies for some time. I felt that you should know mine. We're Southerners by birth. That accounts for our allegiance. But what do you expect to get out of it? Governors are made, not elected. Well, it's a daring scheme, I'll give it that, but I don't think it'll work. Not in a million years.I'm making it my job to see that it works. After all, an army can only hold territory with good defense positions, when its troops are up to strength and when it is well supplied. I propose that our army shall have none of these things. And troops occupied with one fight can't very well take on another. And I propose to occupy our troops. In fact, I have already started. "Reliable information has reached this headquarters... "that a shipment of rifles and ammunition was intercepted by Navajos... "who killed both driver and guards. "It is believed the arms have been cached in the immediate vicinity of Hidden Falls. "A thorough investigation is herewith ordered. "If the arms are located, "it will be assumed that the Navajos have violated treaty and are not desirous of peace. "They will be immediately removed to Yellow Springs, "under force of arms if necessary... "and kept under the close surveillance of your command. Signed, Brigadier General B.N. Stone, Commanding 9th Military District." I don't believe it. Even if it was true, moving the tribe to Yellow Springs would just be asking for trouble. The place isn't fit for animals, let alone humans. That's beside the point. We've been given a clear-cut order. A thorough investigation is herewith ordered. Understand me, Lieutenant. I have no more affection for your Indians than I ever had. At the same time, I'm not anxious for trouble. So I'm turning it over to you. Get a detachment and go and have a look. You won't be coming along, sir? I'll leave the diplomacy to you. Handle it your own way. You can draw whatever supplies you need for gifts just in case you don't find the rifles. Thank you, sir.But if you should find them, don't come back until the whole tribe is moved to Yellow Springs. We won't find anything, sir. Why are we stopping here, Jed? I figure it's gonna be a touchy proposition any way we slice it. Riding in with a full detachment will only make it worse. Seems to me we look peaceful enough. No cannons. No ammo wagons.Just the same, I'm riding ahead with four men. The rest of you can light here.Four men? Primrose, Sabbath--Now hold on, Jed. Whitlock said a detachment. Vaness, Chavez. He said for me to handle it my own way. You men will be riding with me. Leave your guns here.Yes, sir. Now look, Jed, there's no sense taking chances. That's why I'm doing it this way. You men ready?Yes, sir. Let's go. Dismount! Belinka! This is a good surprise.Let's hope so, Menguito. What does that mean? Your face is gray, Belinka. Is there trouble? I don't think so. Except sometimes a man has to say things he doesn't want to say. Worries about them being taken the wrong way. Talk between friends should come easy. All right. Many days ago, an army wagon carrying rifles and powder disappeared. The driver and guards were never seen again. Now the chief of all soldiers in Santa Fe... has been told that the wagon was raided by a party of your braves... who killed the guards and made off with the rifles. I have told you that the peace is strong. You'll find no guns here. I was sure of that before I started.Still you came. Why? My orders are to look for those rifles. I have given you my word. Is that not enough? It's enough for me, but--But not for the soldier chief. No.Then go with your men and look. You'll find no guns. Menguito, wait a minute! No, Belinka. There are too many things between us. See anything? There's nothing up here, sir. All right, come on down. Looks like a wild goose chase, sir. Hey, Chavez! Under the falls! Looks like a cave! Hey, Lieutenant! [ No Audible Dialogue ] Chavez! Get back to Chalmers and tell him what we've found here. We're heading for Menguito's. You were right, Menguito. There are too many things between us. I know nothing of these guns. I speak the truth. Still, I know this is a bad thing, and I will question my people. Never mind. Just tell them to get their belongings together, - be ready to move to Yellow Springs by sunset. - I will give no such word. My orders are to move you out. You speak of a place where vultures grow fat... from the bodies of those who die without food in winter and without water in summer. This is our home. We will not move. Hear me well, Menguito. If you haven't given the word to your people by the time that cloud passes the sun, I'll open fire. Look around you, Belinka. When that cloud passes the sun. [ Guns Cocking ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Horse Whinnies ] Seems like it's your turn to look around, Menguito. An evil heart rises from the spirit of the father and enters the body of his son. I am not so old that the sight of my mind grows blind. To this day it sees another peaceful village surrounded and attacked, burned to the ground without cause. From where I stand as chief, I say that will not happen again. We will travel to Yellow Spring. But I tell you this, Son of Evil, I give you no promise of peace. "Following confiscation of the rifles and ammunition, "the Navajos were removed to Yellow Springs as per your instructions. "I will await further orders regarding... disposition of the arms"-- et cetera, et cetera-- "Lee N. Whitlock, Captain"-- et cetera, et cetera. I've seen Yellow Springs. They won't stay there for long. I hope not, gentlemen. However, I'll know more about that... after I've had a firsthand look into conditions at Union. What happens if the lid blows off while you're away? Well, if that happens, I couldn't ask for better timing. [ Chuckles ] Captain Whitlock, sir.I've been looking forward to this meeting, Captain. I hope you won't mind putting me up for a few days.It'll be a pleasure, sir. Oh, Sergeant. Would you see to General Stone's luggage? And find some quarters for his men.Yes, sir. I'd just about given up on these supplies, sir. I'm afraid it's barely half of what you requested. For some reason supplies are getting harder to come by every day. I've sent a dozen urgent letters to Washington. All I get in return are promises. Oh, Sergeant. Have a detail store the ammunition in the magazine right away. Yes, sir.Shall we go inside, sir? Hey, don't let them stripes go to your head, hominy grits. Everybody works on this here plantation. This army sure comes up with some of the stupidest, muddleheaded notions. Stickin' a magazine a half mile outside an army post. Why don't they put it inside where it belongs? Because if it ever blew up, it'd take this whole fort with it, and you included. I suppose they just couldn't put a door on it so we'd get to it from the outside... instead of crawling through a hole in the ground. Sure. Except them doors don't care who opens 'em-- white men or Injuns. How'd you get to the powder if the fort was under attack? ¿Comprende? Use the head, Biddle. What head? From the neck up he's all mouth. If that's the best the South can do, I sure pity them. You know, Vaness, one of these days... somebody gonna have the pleasure of taking the pitch out of you. But it won't be you, Biddle. You bellow and snort like a bull, but you sure fight like a heifer.Oh, yeah? Well, let's just see about that. [ Jed ] Break it up, fast. - What's going on here? - Well, I had just about all I could take... from this no-good Yankee.That's what you think, reb. Attention! Looks like a nice, cool guardhouse... is the best place for hot tempers like yours. Follow me. Well, I don't know when I've enjoyed better food or such pleasurable company. You've made Union seem so attractive, I may be permanently spoiled for Santa Fe. Thank you, General. You're most gallant. This just came in, sir.Thank you, Sergeant. Excuse me. Oh.Bad news, sir? Yes, it is, Captain. The whole Apache nation has gone on the warpath. [ Chattering ] According to this, they're already in bad shape at Fort Stanton. They need help-- all the help they can get. I'm afraid you're in for some heavy duty, Captain. How soon can you be ready to take the field?Take the field? Yes, leaving behind just a skeleton complement. Well, I should think 24 hours should do it, sir. Good. You'll leave behind only those men absolutely necessary to staff the post. Everybody else goes, full equipment. And you will proceed directly to Stanton. General, if you pull us out of here now, it'll leave this territory wide open, and Menguito'd just love that. He'd go crazy anytime he felt like it. Well, I was under the impression the Navajos were at peace. After sending them to Yellow Springs? Well, undoubtedly, Menguito's in a sulky mood, but from all reports he's not making any medicine. Neither were the Apaches. You can't tell about these things, sir. All right. I'll send a message to headquarters to rush up a company of 100-day volunteers. They're not much, but they can handle this kind of trouble. Even so, sir, it'll take 'em a few days to get here. It'll take Menguito longer than that to put his paint on, let alone round up weapons and horses. I wouldn't bank on that. The Utes are only a hundred miles away, and they'd be happy to supply Menguito with everything he needs. Couldn't we at least wait until the volunteers get here? - That might be a fatal delay. - But, General-- Lieutenant, you're worried about what a handful of Navajos might do. I'm worried about what the entire Apache nation is doing right now. There's no other way to handle it. I'll see you in your office, Captain. All right, gentlemen, I'll make this brief. Lieutenant Sayre, you'll be in charge of preparations. Every minute counts, so I'd suggest you get a move on. Lieutenant Posick, you remain here at the post. Figure out the men you need, but keep it to the bone. By the way, Sayre, you can release Biddle and Vaness. We'll need every available man. That's all, gentlemen. Come along, Marcy. We have some packing to do. Everything's under way, sir. With luck, we should be able to leave by sunrise. Good. The sooner the better. Worried? Only about Marcy. Maybe it's a mistake, my taking her along. If we should run into any serious trouble, I-- Oh, no, you won't. You won't. [ Lock Clicks ] As a matter of fact, Captain, the Apaches have never been in a more peaceful mood. Yes, I know. I also said you'd be going to Fort Stanton. Well, uh, that wasn't exactly true either. However, you will be headed in that general direction. What are you talkin' about? So far as the men are concerned, you will be going to Stanton. Your, uh, job, is to gradually ease them into Texas. By the time you get there, war will have been declared. We can assume that, uh, one third of the men... will enlist in the Confederate army. The others will be taken prisoners of war. Oh, that message was simply a device. First, it enabled me to put your troops on the march headed south. Secondly, it informed me that Fort Sumter would be fired on within a week. Well, how can you possibly know that? The simple truth is that I'm on your side, Captain. Actually, I've been in close touch with what is now Confederate headquarters... for several months.A copperhead. Well-- [ Chuckles ] not nearly so outspoken as that. In Washington, I'm still considered a staunch defender of Union principles. Then it's gonna happen. Really happen. Have you ever had any doubts?No. Just hopes. I guess I really never stopped hopin'. That there wouldn't be a war?Yes. 'Cause the South can't win this war-- not now, not in a million years. And that's what's been eatin' at my insides for longer than I can tell you. This is an attitude I hadn't expected. What did you expect?That you'd be ready to fight. Whitlock, when I manipulated your transfer here I was told I could count on you. I was told that you were a man of intense loyalty, deeply devoted to the cause. Cause? Causes may start wars. They don't win them. And I don't know why you're in this. Obviously, for what you can get out of it. I have my reasons. I'm sure they don't include love.Love? The kind a man has for his home, his people, the land he grew up on. The kind that keeps him awake nights... thinking about it all being blown to pieces. The earth scorched dry. Crops ruined. Friends slaughtered. Wonderin' what'll be left when it's all over. Aren't you jumping to conclusions? I'm facing facts-- military facts. The Union has too much of everything-- troops, supplies, production and money-- especially money-- and that's what it takes to win wars. Believe me, if I thought we had a chance-- even a slim chance-- I want you to read something. I think it will brighten your outlook considerably. This is the Confederate plan of a surprise campaign in the West. Plus an account of my contribution to ensure the success of that plan. [ Sighs ] Well, what do you think? Lee, if the strategy works, if we can cut off the gold supply, we'll have severed the Union's lifeline. It'll be over before you know it. And after we pull out, there won't be any replacements? No hundred-day volunteers?No. And the rifles the Navajos were supposed to have stolen, and the move to Yellow Springs, that was all part of your contribution? It'll put Menguito on the warpath. When he gets out of hand, I'll have an excuse to draw troops from Stanton. That will leave the territory's first line of defense completely untenable. Why, the Confederacy can walk in. After the Apaches? Do you ever stop to think... how many innocent families will be butchered because of this? How many innocent families will be butchered in Mississippi? I'm talking about cold-blooded mass murder.Well, what do you think war is? You've been talking about facing facts. Well, face these. If the strategy works, the South will have all the odds in its favor. It can win the war. If the strategy fails, everything you said before will probably come true. Make your choice on that basis. Why couldn't you have picked someone else? Because I needed a man who loved his home so much he'd do anything for it. Think about your home, Lee. Think about some of those nightmares you had. All right. I'll do it. But God help me, win or lose, I'll never sleep another night through so long as I live. All set? Here's a copy of the report I showed you. When you reach your destination, you will turn it over to a Colonel Larson. I don't have to impress you with its importance. Well, good luck, Lee. Thanks. Lieutenant Sayre, you and the scout take the point. [ Whistles ] Well, bye, sir.Good-bye, Lieutenant. Have a good trip, and hurry those 100-daysers along. It's getting mighty lonesome here. They're probably already on the way.I hope so. You can save the general a bumpy ride if you meet the stage at the junction, but you'll have to get a move on if you want to make it. [ Men Shouting ] [ Speaking Navajo ] [ Speaking Navajo ] What do you think, Joe? No Apache. According to the general--No Apache. What about Menguito? Got any notion of what he might be up to? [ Men Shouting ] [ Glass Shattering ] Howdy, Lieutenant. Is this the column out of Union? That's right.Good. I'm supposed to hook up with you. Where do I find Captain Whitlock? Where'd they come from?That's what I'd like to know. It's a funny place to rendezvous. Supply train?Yeah. Guns and ammunition. Well, we sure can use 'em. Seems kind of peculiar they'd send 'em chasséing all over the country... with just a four-man escort, especially with Apaches kicking up such a fuss. ♪ [ Harmonica ][ Chattering ] The horses are all taken care of, sir. Lieutenant Fry and two men are bedding down near 'em for the night. Will the captain be making a round of the pickets before turning in, sir? What? Oh, I'll take care of that, Sergeant. Good night.Good night. Stop stirring that fire, you idiot! You don't know any better to stir a fire in bivouac, it's high time someone taught you! Lee, is anything wrong?What make you think anything's wrong? The way you've been actin', for one thing. What do you want me to do? Let 'em burn the place down? The fact that you haven't said three words to me since we left the fort for another. Well, I'm sorry, honey. I've had a lot on my mind. Oh, I know you too well, Lee. It takes more than that to put you on edge. Tell me. What is it? If something's bothering you, there's no sense keeping it locked up inside. I told you there was nothing wrong. Marcy, I don't mean to be rude, but I gotta make my rounds. You better get some rest. Jed, I'm worried about Lee. Why? What's the matter?I don't know. I-- I can't put my finger on it, but something's upsettin' him. He hasn't been himself at all. Haven't you noticed it? Well, he's got a big responsibility. Oh, he's had responsibility before, and it never affected him like this. This is different. It's new to him. You don't think there's something else? Now, you stop worrying. There's nothing wrong. He'll probably straighten out as soon as we hit Stanton. Come to think of it, I haven't seen much of you either. Tell your brother to take me off the point. I can't be in two places at once. You're not on the point now. No, ma'am, I'm sure not. [ Rattle Rattling ] Don't move, Marcy. What's the matter? You better run along, Marcy. I'll get rid of this fella. Hey, Bid. Did you ever hear of a Colonel Larson in Stanton? Larson. Stanton. No, never. Why? This sort of fell out of Whitlock's saddlebag. It got me curious. Curious enough to risk a court-martial? Yeah. That does it. The rest of the sentries can be trusted. These men understand?I read the letter to 'em. Good. Sabbath, take two men and spike the cannon. It'll only slow us down.Yes, sir. [ Indistinct ] Now, you men all know your jobs. Let's get going. Stay where you are and nobody'll get hurt. What is this, Sayre?So we're all in the same army, huh? What do you propose to do about it? I propose to get back to Union before Menguito does. And then I intend to alert every garrison in the territory. Jed. Jed. I was just coming to get you, Marcy. This will explain things better than I can. Sergeant McAfee, send some men after the horses and get those ammo wagons turned around. Yes, sir. [ Man ] Hey, Lieutenant! You have enough ammo and supplies to get by. Don't bother with the cannons. They're spiked. All right, men! Let's make time. Forward, ho! Well, stop starin' at me, Marcy. I mean it. I can't help it. I see a stranger, and I'm curious about strangers. But don't you see? There was nothing else I could do. It was our only chance to win. Didn't the price bother you at all? It's my home too, Lee, and I love it as much as you do. But I think what I love most about it are the people. A strange breed, Lee, full of pride and honor, dignity, tradition. They may lose the war and suffer terribly for it, but I don't think they'd want to win it this way. Then why didn't you go back with Jed? Did you just stay here to see if you could tear me apart? No. I stayed because I was ashamed-- so terribly ashamed. All right, men. Saddle up. We're going back to Union. [ Chattering ] - [ Groans ] - Ambush! Ambush! Vaness, get out of there! [ Shouting ] Set up a barricade. We'll see if we can keep 'em penned in. Jed, that's suicide.We got men inside this fort and we're not leaving them. Maybe they're not gonna come out. They'll come out, all right. It's just a question of when. This waiting's getting us nowhere.You got a better idea? [ Man Shouting ]Here they come. [ Shouting ] Over here, you men! [ Whinnies ] ♪ [ Bugle: Charge ] Thanks, Whitlock. You're a little late. Menguito had the fort when we got here. Jed! Jed! This is no place for a woman. I'll have a man take you in to Watrous. Let's get one thing straight, Sayre. Marcy only stayed with me because she couldn't face you after what I'd done. [ Gunfire ] Thanks for coming back, Marcy. [ Screams ] Make these count. There ain't too much left. [ Laughs ] Didn't I tell you this army was muddleheaded, Chavez? We bury tons of ammunition in the magazine, and then run short 'cause we can't get to it. Ha! You think you and your men can draw Menguito to the front of the fort... and keep him occupied for about 20 minutes? Well, we can make a pretty good try at it. Why? Might give me a chance to get inside.Huh? Through the magazine tunnel. Putt, get the horses. You men about ready?Just about. All set, sir. All right, men, mount up. [ Gunfire Continues ] We're through! You all right, honey?Uh-huh. Hey. Where'd you get that? My kid brother sent it to me. I've been saving it for the right time. Well, let's hope this is the right time. Ready? Charge! [ Speaking Navajo ] [ Shouting ] [ Speaking Navajo ] [ Gunfire ] Do as he says. Stay where you are. I didn't do that for you, Stone. Anything you get you deserve. There's been a lot of killing here today. Looks like there's gonna be a lot more from here on in. Think you oughta know why. I know why, Belinka. It will always be this way between our people. With men like him around, yes. He planted those rifles and ammunition your people were supposed to have stolen, then sent us out to find them... and to move your people to Yellow Springs. Why would he do this thing? 'Cause he knew you wouldn't sit still for it, and before long, you'd start making medicine. That's what he wanted. Is this true? Tell him, Stone. Go ahead and tell him, or so help me, I'll kill you myself. No, Menguito! That won't help. I think nothing will help now, Belinka. Take your people-- what's left of them anyway-- and go on back to the hills. Go on home. [ Speaking Navajo ] Good luck.Thanks. Good-bye, honey.Good-bye, Lee. Take good care of her, Mr. Sayre. Yes, sir. Ten-hut![ Men ] Ten-hut! Column, south! All right, Ben, dismiss the troops. Dismissed!
