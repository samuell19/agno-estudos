Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. This old fakir born and wandering in Himanchal Pradesh is Mandhari. Grieving for his long lost friends... this artist wanders the length of the country. Mandhari. He has been witness to the history of Sanatanpur and its traders. Trader... Trader... Where are you trader? Where are you? Where are those evenings written in Suraj's blood? Where are winds laden with explosives... That which has grown and been nurtured... ...under the shade of your terror and hatred... ...that love asks you... Where are you trader? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? As per your promise, these students have come to meet you. So you want to listen to the trader�s story from Mandhari. - Yes. Mandhari, if anybody dares to point you out... The each of Sanatanpur will fall... ...on Pali Nagar as a bomb. Thakur Rajeshwar Singh doesn't talk about history, he writes history. He makes history. Where are you, trader? Is that all? No one can stand against time. Today, you can't even talk... Today, Mandhari will tell your story. Mandhari, who has seen every victory and every defeat of yours. Who has seen your friendship, deeper than an ocean. And your worse-than-hell enmity. You were so innocent as a child! As a child, when in this air of Sanatanpur... ...without the burden of any wealth, power... ...and discrimination, you... ...used to fly like a free bird. You couldn't breath without each other. One was a farmer's son and one was a king's. But childhood is Godhood. How can it discriminate between a king and a pauper? Childhood is like a wandering butterfly in His garden. And sings just one song: Dinak, Dinak, tin tara... Dinak, Dinak re... ♫ Bunch of tamarind and a plant of berries... ♫ ♫ Tamarind is sour and berries are sweet... ♫ ♫ Bunch of tamarind and a plant of berries... ♫ ♫ Tamarind is sour and berries are sweet... ♫ ♫ We are two lions of this jungle... ♫ ♫ We are getting late, let's go home... ♫ ♫ We are getting late, let's go home... ♫ ♫ Bunch of tamarind and a plant of berries... ♫ ♫ Tamarind is sour and berries are sweet... ♫ One day Raju fractured his leg while pushing Veeru's cart. The doctor forbade Raju from attending school for a fortnight. Veeru swore before God, that until Raju's leg healed... ...he too would walk on one leg. Such was the friendship of Raju and Veeru. Oh my friend. When the village hoodlum Baliram, ogled at Raju's sister. Veeru couldn't bear it. Veeru! Baliram! How dare you lay a finger on my friend! You scoundrel! - Raju! I will wring your neck! - Let him go, Raju. I said let him go! No Veeru, he leered at my sister. I kill him. Brother Raju! No Raju, don't kill him. Raju! You're bound by an oath on me. Look, he escaped. You bound me by your oath! Yes, I did. You will not kill him, Raju. - No, Veeru. ♫ Friend, why does this world swing? ♫ ♫ Friend, why does this world swing? ♫ ♫ Why is there a price for everything? ♫ ♫ All this is deceit. ♫ ♫ All this is deceit. ♫ ♫ There is no deceit in love. ♫ ♫ Bunch of tamarind and a plant of berries... ♫ ♫ Tamarind is sour and berries are sweet... ♫ ♫ We are two lions of this jungle... ♫ ♫ We are getting late, let's go home... ♫ ♫ We are getting late, let's go home... ♫ Rajeshwar's sister, Kanta loved Veer Singh with all her heart. When Raju's wife discovered this. Rajeshwar approached Veeru's elder sister with a marriage proposal. Brother, I'm very happy. We're happier than you, silly girl. Now their friendship will turn into a relationship. Sister dear, did you hear what your husband is doing? What is he doing? On Pali's wedding day, he's giving 1200 acres of mountain land... ...and Thakurgarh to Veer Singh. Chuniya, if I ruled the earth, I'd give everything away to Veeru. Did you find out where he is? - Yes, I spoke to him. He's gone for Ram Shastri's daughter's wedding. Wedding. - Yes, wedding. No sir. Don't tell the wedding procession to return. I'll pay you every penny of the dowry. But today, I am helpless. The groom will turn back! - Let's go, my son. - No, sir. If the groom leaves the wedding scene, who will marry my daughter? There's no need to plead with scoundrels like him. The daughter of our village is our honour. Then why don't you marry her yourself? Veeru! What have you done? - Nothing. Your action has ruined my Laxmi's life! I said nothing will happen. - Now who will marry her? What are you asking him? He's received 1200 acres land as dowry! Pali! Thakur! She has taken poison! Get a shroud for your sister, not a wedding dress. A shroud! Your friend has proven to be a good friend. My friend, at least ask me what happened. What can I ask you? Do I ask why you did not kill yourself instead of coming here? Should I ask why you cremated a lifelong friendship? Or if you will cover my sister's corpse with your wife's scarf? Raju! - Raju is dead and Veeru is finished. You traitor! Why are you instigating things here? Take this jinx with you! - Shut up, you dog! How dare you raise your hand on a woman? Take this scoundrel away! Veer Singh. Go away. Before I end up with blood on my hands, go away. Pal, you were right. Raju is dead and Veeru is finished. You can assume it is true. Laxmi, come on. I have seen everything. Raju! Rajeshwar left Sanatanpur and went abroad. The sun set on friendship for all the years to come. 25 years went by. Rajeshwar expanded his business abroad. And his sons swore to build their own Pali Nagar. Uncle, Gajendra and Devinder promise you. Our factories will rule every field in Sanatanpur. Every farmer will be our slave. Veeru alias Veer Singh had become the Village Chief. He had two sons who sold fruit and vegetables. Look, I put the vermillion. It is said there's no better way to apply vermilion. You and your new fangled ideas! Nobody has heard of a father teaching his son to whistle. The father never shot a hen and the son is a marksman! - Aunt! The father did what he had to, and the son is learning to whistle. Aunt - What? Have you any idea what your brother is doing? What is Gagan doing? - Loading his gun with bullets. The rumour has been confirmed, Gagan. Rajeshwar's sons have bribed the government servants. And this year's deal too will go in their favour. Just watch now, Baliram. Both will be cremated there. Now you understand politics. You've got the brains of a dog! What? - Baliram is right. But even dogs are loyal to their masters. Do you think your politics will succeed? No. That one day you will be the king of Sanatanpur? No. That you'll bury Dada Veer and Rajeshwar? Never! You can chop off the branches of their love, but not the roots. This will never happen. And I will expose you for the rascal you are, to Rajeshwar. Me! Wait for your destruction. Of your devastation. No! I'm a widow. Don't take away my child too! Don't send him away! It's not safe for him here. Vasu's life is in danger in Sanatanpur. My father wants you to raise him and teach him weaponry. But this violence has to end somewhere. Bonds. If love can be obliterated by hatred... ...only love can erase hatred. The rest is destiny. What has to happen will. Yes, collector. I've returned to Pali Nagar. I'll meet you tonight regarding Vishal's death. Sure. Come to my house. Around 9 PM. Don't tremble. The job's been done. Conspiracy! Your dear friend Veer Singh spun such a web... ...that we were helpless. And you've been sentenced for 14 years! 14 years is nothing. Thakur Rajeshwar Singh will return after even 114 years! And then he'll annihilate Veer Singh! The army officers took charge of ending the mayhem in the hills. They made the river Bees flowing through Pali Nagar and Sanatanpur... ...the border between these 2 villages. Both appointed their own guards. Many years went by. Rajeshwar was seething behind the prison bars. And Dadaveer gave his farmers guns. But he couldn't forget the companionship of his friend. In this world of drunken capitalists, truth had no place. The sweet voice from Thakur's bungalow. It didn't take long to realize This is Gaja's daughter, Rajeshwar's granddaughter, Radha. She's finished college and come here for the first time for a break. Dear. Are you Gaja's daughter? Yes and you? You are Mandhari, aren't you? Radha? You're out of your room again! Go back and don't dare step out! Come on darling. Monty. Are you sad? Let's dance together. Come on. No thanks. Sweet heart. Daddy, I love her. We'll get you married, my son. But first let me get married. Father you're going to be married? This is your third mother. What? Third mother. My name is Pammy. - And I'm Rummy. And I'm Yummy. - Father. They are her sisters. Part of her dowry. Oh Chuniya, you are very naughty. - She speaks English! Radha? What's wrong with you, my dear sis? I'll go back to Delhi! I won't live here! - Why? Everyone keeps reprimanding me. Father changed so much after mother's death. Everyone would know if grand daddy were here. Mad girl. I come here every year on my vacations. Nobody here loves anyone. There's only the palace and wealth. I feel suffocated! I go horse riding every morning. Come with me. Really? Amla, did you bring Lord Krishna's idol? Yes. But why is Janamashtmi being celebrated with such pomp? Why not? His darling nephew Vasu returns after 14 years. The prince of Sanatanpur returns. Goodness me! You're still here? Hurry up, we still have to go to Ladi hill and then bring Vasu here. Sister, where is Aarti? There's so much work. Everything waits for her. Your dear daughter-in-law is sitting and... ...reading the letter his teacher wrote praising Vasu. She's already read it a hundred times. - Why shouldn't she? Her son is returning. Her youthful son. Talented and young. Just like me. You? - Yes.

Now do you understand? Will you come back here? - Of course. No. Listen. If you do, don't cross this border. By the way, my name is Vasudev, the enemy's son. Vasu! - Vasu! Vasu! - Vasu! Vasu! - Vasu! Mother! You could hear me with all this noise? A mother's voice can be heard even in the nether world. All these years all I hear is your voice and father's whistle. May you live long, my child. I snuck away to meet you. Why? Vasu! I forbade you to come here. Where were you? You'll live at the security post, not home. Vasu... Like you, these soldiers left home to guard Sanatanpur. Henceforth you'll stay with these men! Understand? Grandpa? No. My darling. What is all this? Your uncle has done the right thing. These days the enemy has the upper hand in Sanatanpur. Now my Vasu... ...you have to take the form Krishna assumed in the Mahabharata. And fight. And fight till the enemy surrenders. If it be your command, Vasu will offer his head. The enemy's heads will be chopped off. Why should yours be, my child? They are our enemies! Don't you dare step towards the river! I'll break your legs! Who dropped you to the gate? - Papa, I don't know. Today we'll show Vasu the enemy fort that we must conquer. Thakurgarh. - Yes, Thakurgarh... ...where our lives are sold to foreigners. But how will we go there? Disguised as soldiers. Where's Vasu? - He's nowhere in sight. Vasu! Vasu! Listen. Why is it dark in here? There's no light. Go carefully.

Enemy? Friend. Good luck. - Funny. You city folk call this good luck? Of course. I mean something good is going to happen. - Is that so? Yes, good luck. Your soldiers. Who was he? - Who are you? Me? I'm here for your protection. I can protect myself. Stay here. Yes, Her Majesty Radha Singh Thakur. Wow! A girl of 4 feet with a 4-foot long name! Yes. This is how my name is written in English. My English is better than yours. What do you mean? - What does this mean? T - Yes, just T. T for tickets? I said just T. - Just T? What? T means Tea? Tea? - Yes, tea. Tea. - Now, what is this?

Rajeshwar Singh is home after serving his 14 year sentence. Rajeshwar Singh. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Pa! Grandpa! Grandpa, I'm so glad you're back! I've been waiting for you. Where were you? I didn't know you were coming today. Even the Maker doesn't know when I come and go. Mandhari! Lightning strikes the sky and doesn't illuminate the earth? That's not possible. Every child of the village knows Thakur Rajeshwar Singh is back. Welcome. Come. I counted every day left for your return. I wish you'd called out to me. I'd have evaded death to come to you. The world knows that when Rajeshwar makes a friend... ...paeans are written about it. And when he makes a foe, history is made. Look, I brought you a small present That may bring back memories. The tamarind tree, the berry creeper. The decision now lies in your hands. Either kiss this picture or... I will announce my decision. Provided you convey it to Veer Singh accurately. I promise. There can be only one deal between Veer Singh and me. Death! Who did you ask before going there? Who advised you to? What was the need for you to go there? I went there in the last hope. That he'd have cooled down after 14 years. 14 years. He says 14 years. Even after 114 years, his anger won't abate! He'll always be the same beast! He uses his sword on a painting surrounded by 4 wooden bars! You should've told him... ...step out of your home if you're so brave and go to the arena. You'll find Dada Veer standing up front! Then use your sword if you have the guts. I swear by Lord Shiv, if Dada Veer lifts a finger... If Dada Veer lifts one finger... ...every atom of Sanatanpur will explode on Pali Nagar like a bomb! We'll match stone for stone. It will be all flattened out. Dadabir. - Forget it. You humiliated me. Just wait and watch. His feet won't touch the ground. He'll be soaring in the sky. Sir, there's something wrong with the engine. So turn back to Pali Nagar. - No, we'll have to land here. Why? - We might have an accident. All right, land here. - But we have enemies here. It's better to face the enemy than to die in an accident. But they are very dangerous. Land here. - Ok, sir. Brother. I'm not astonished to see you. - Neither am I. The same style, temperament, arrogance. That was always there, and will always be. Still there is one difference. You used to soar in the skies. Today your feet are on the ground. Rajeshwar soars in the skies in spite of being on the ground. I understand. Now show me your flight. There you stand and here I am. And the gun lies between us. Pick up the gun and shoot me. Satisfy the dreams in your heart. I'm standing before you. I don't accept charity. I will kill you, certainly. But with my own gun. The bullet too. So will the time. The gun will be yours. The bullet, too. And the time. Morning or evening, whatever you wish. Just call out. You'll find Veer Singh there. Time will bring you to me Today time is on your side The army is yours. I want to see who fires the first shot to Rajeshwar's chest. You won't die of a snake bite. Crops are cultivated, and harvested on the land you stand on. We won't let this earth be defiled by attacking an unarmed man. I'm glad you've come, Colonel. Tell Veer Singh that snakes and scorpions don't sting lions... ...but crawl as far away as they can. And the deal was not about saving life, but destroying it. And this devastation will take place. Kunal, time is flying. You should talk to your family. Grandfather has increased the patrol around the house. So? - Give me some more time. I hope I don't die.... Vasu, papa has prohibited me from leaving the palace. Now I may not be able to meet you. Dynamite can rip open the earth. But the flower will still bloom in the lake. You're very glib in your dialogues. - I'm good at action too. Really? But now how will we meet? I've found a solution. - Solution? These are three coloured balloons. - Yes. If you let the red one fly, I'll think you mean, stop. There's danger I see, and the yellow? The yellow means I miss you. ILU. The green balloon signifies come over. Like a bird, I'll immediately fly to your palace. Wonderful, my love bird! 50 guns await you. Call me and see whether the guns win or a lover's magic. Challenge. - Challenge. What will you give me if I win this deal? No, I don't want to accept any challenge. Especially if it puts your life at risk. I went to Rajeshwar's house to meet him. I found all of them have gone hunting to Samistipur. Yes, he loved to hunt right from childhood. You are their childhood friend. Enlighten them. Colonel Sir, for the house that's been in the dark for years... ...a light from outside has no meaning. Only a lamp in the house can vanquish that darkness. Is there no such lamp in that house? The day there is I swear I will dance on one foot! Beautiful! What have you done? - It was a balloon, so I set it free. But it was my balloon! - So what? Red balloon? Radha! Don't you know you're not supposed to come out of your room? Go inside. ♫ Hey strange bird.

From the abode of God, the home of Allah, this was bound to happen. My children, Mandhari could sacrifice 10 lives for your love. Terrific! We don't understand. - That's because you aren't aware. The men whose children you are hate each other today. There was a time when they were the best of friends. Pardon? Want to hear their story? Then listen. Did you understand the story? They are mortal enemies. And you sneak out to meet a girl from Sanatanpur. If brother-in-law finds out- What is it? Nothing, brother-in-law. I was explaining to him... ...that being pals with a labourer from Sanatanpur... ...is akin to befriending a scorpion. I would befriend a scorpion and even consume its venom. But I can't bear even the water of Sanatanpur. This is the story of two friends who are enemies today. If your love is the holy river Ganga... ...they are its banks that can never meet. Never! If these banks try to obstruct the river of our love... ...a deluge from the river will destroy the banks. There will be a flood. No. My grandpa is very nice. For my happiness, he will let go of all his grudges. We'll make them friends again. Isn't that so? - Yes, uncle. Lord, did you hear that? Now you are being tested, not me. I just want to see if you turn their love into a river of love... ...or one of blood. Kunal, our child is born. Father took the child to Dada Veer. Come soon. Waiting for you, Amla. This can't happen. These men will kill me. What happened? Bholaram, when Radha returns, tell her I've gone back to the city. I might return in a day or two or I may just call. All right. This baby is Rajeshwar's grandson Kunal's son. He ensnared Amla in his web of love. And made her victim to his lust. He ruined our name. We will have to answer for this! First, bring Amla to me. After delivering her baby, she went to Pali Nagar to find Kunal. Kunal. Kuna... Mohanlal. - Yes? I want to meet Kunal. You want to meet Kunal? Yes, it's urgent. - I understand. Don't worry. I'm Kunal's uncle. Come in. Come in. Drive on. No! Kunal! Let me go! No! Let me go! No! No, no! Kunal! No! No, no! Thakur Rajeshwar Singh is returning from the hunt. This is a lie! An absolute lie! It's a strategy to defame our family! How can you defame the infamous? Today the entire village knows your son... ...eloped with this poor man's daughter. And gave her this memento. And then murdered her when his secret was exposed! Don't you dare accuse my innocent son of murder! If you wish, we will show you what murder is. Not one or ten. Hundreds and thousands! We'll annihilate the entire village! You got it? Such arrogance about your strength! So fire away! And see how your entire family is destroyed! Fire away! Shoot! Rajeshwar, yours pups are blind and deaf. They are blind because that poor man stands there with the girl's body. But they don't see the corpse. The child is weeping bitterly. But the sound doesn't reach their ears. Veer Singh... ...my sons aren't blind or deaf. They aren't blind because they can see the truth behind your charade. And they are not deaf Because they hear the enemy in the cries of the child. Mr. Rajeshwar, this isn't about our enmity. We're talking about a human relationship. Emotions from within. Emotions are begged for with your head lowered not raised. Sir, these are the emotions of an innocent child... ...asking you for his rights to a relationship. And one asks for one's rights with the head held high, not bent. One day this child will come to you with his head high. Because his mother got a raw deal. His mother was deceived. At least today you understand the meaning of deceit. Before you became Village Chief, you were Chief of Deceit. Even today my sister Pali's soul wanders in these hills. It screams at the mention of your deceit. Not just you, generations of Sanatanpur know this. History is not made by twists of fate. If you reopen old wounds, blood will spurt out. I swear by Shiv, swords will be unsheathed. You and your sons trample the chests of the poor. You seize the land of destitute farmers. You talk of history? The court sentenced you to 14 years in prison for murder. That was too little. You should have been hanged by the noose! Veer Singh! You know better than me who committed the murder. As for history, Thakur Rajeshwar Singh doesn't narrate history. He writes history. He creates history! Now listen to this Thakur's decision. I don't accept this child. Nor will I ever accept it. All right. If that's your decision then... ...you listen to my decision. This innocent child will grow up in Sanatanpur, with me. But until you and your progeny accept this child's rights... ...we won't let there any wedding take place in your family. We won't let any child grow up in Pali Nagar! I swear by my children and myself. I that swear by every child, youth and old of Sanatanpur. I swear! - We swear! I swear! - We swear! Veer Singh, if this ever happens, it will be Sanatanpur's last day. We swear! We swear! We swear! We swear! We swear! We swear! We swear! This is the last warning to inhabitants of both villages. After this if either side fires a shot... I will appeal to the government to cancel your licenses. Do you understand? What is going on Dadaveer... Rajeshwar brother? You are the elders. You must say something. They have taken a pledge. We are only responding to it. Talk to them because they swore to finish off our kids! Only the devil could take such an oath! Colonel, these guys are the devil! Even today their sins are smeared on our forehead! Stop it, guys! I called you here for peace! Then call the father of the child. His son. And ask him for the truth! Call him here? Why? To sacrifice my children to these blood thirsty men? - Never! But where is your son? - I'm sending both my kids to Delhi today. Can't they come here? - They're probably at the station. What are you saying, Radha? That's the truth. I can't live without Vasu. Radha! Radha! Radha! I turned out to be a coward. But I won't let you be one. You must do what's right. Radha! Dear - You go on. I'll manage everything. I said I can't help you! Go! But you are the messiah of love. That's why we've come to you. What can I do? Should I advise you to elope and get married? So they get enraged and kill you both? Or do I suggest that you commit suicide? So that gunshots kill thousands in both villages. Should I advise you to do that? Then what do we do? I can only advise you to return to your homes. And forget about your love. We've left our homes for love, Mandhari uncle. Then where will you go? - To the abode of God. Let's go. The apostle of love may concede defeat. But not lovers. Stop! You'll go to God. Commit suicide. Cowards! I have a solution. But it's very risky. Will you try it? Grandpa? This is Kunal. Kunal, how is Radha? She's gone to Shimla on a college scout camp. She'll be back in 2 months. - Take care, son. Yes, grandpa. But the weddings of our kids? They will certainly get married. Son, don't forget that if we have enemies like Veer Singh... ...we also have friends like Mahendra Singh. I've chosen a groom for Radha. No, this is impossible! It is fraught with danger! You've come this far lured by a web of danger. This is your only option. Your last hope. Last hope? But we could get killed. No Radha, uncle is right. Dying is better than committing suicide. And the world will know the truth about our love. But this is like trying to get water from stones! If Farhad could dig a river of milk through the mountains for Shireen We can build a river of love through these hills. We accept your test. Vasu! Vasu! Come on! Do just as I say. With whose permission did you throw away those arms and flee? Because I don't want to touch these arms! What? - Yes. What have these guns given us? Blood? Corpses? Orphans? Widows? Idiot, that's what the inhabitants of Pali Nagar have given us! Hence this war! I want no part of this war... ... with vengeance that's been raging through centuries! This revenge is for my brother! Your father! My father never wanted this. He wanted to destroy hatred not the enemy. So you refuse to fight. Even the Mahabharata was fought. Who won it? You are right, son. Whether we lose or win, we can't live like cowards. But grandpa - I heard all you said. At your age, I too loved to talk like that. My ideals prohibit me from taking up weapons. When his soul isn't in it, how can he take up weapons? How can he shoot? Send him back! To his teacher! Take him away. Send him back. That's a great decision. I wanted to suggest that to you long ago. Why didn't you say so then? Better late than never. I'm going to the Red Mountain to the teacher tomorrow. If you wish, I can drop him off. - That would be nice. Go to the teacher. And tell him. When we finish fighting to death and everything ends... ...tell the teacher to send this Kishen back to us to play his flute. To play his flute. He'll wander in these hills, whistling. Whistling! Mother, I'm going for a few days. You never came back to me. I just saw you grow up in pictures. Grandpa, forgive me. Silly boy. Don't you know you're a piece of my heart? Come in. This is my home, too. I was born here and I will die here. I don't know about your birth, but you will die right here. Good day. I take away one child and give you one in return. Child? Fate plays such tricks. - What are you talking about? I had a sister in Kanpur. Saraswati? Saraswati? - The priestess. Oh her. That poor woman died years ago. Yes but she had a widowed daughter Sumitra. What happened to her? - She died last night, too. She died? - Yes, and killed me too. Ask me, how? How? By leaving this child an orphan. When the neighbours brought her to me, I thought to myself... ...you are going to the mountain. What will you do about her? Then I thought what home could be better than this? Does this look like an orphanage? Sister, it's a matter of a few months. She'll help with the chores and look after you. If you wish, she'll stay here like a servant. Don't worry. This child will live in this house. Look, dear. Don't worry. Consider this your own house. Come, let's go. Ready? - Yes. Everything is ready. Come. I'll escort you to the border. - Yes, it's about to be evening. Look, don't cry. I understand that you're homeless. But I assure you, there's love in every pore of this home. And everyone will love you. Isn't that so, mother? - Yes. Good luck. When something auspicious is going to happen... ...we wish each other good luck. ♫ ILU - ILU ♫ ♫ ILU - ILU ♫ Girl, what is your name? I'm Radha. Vasu. Is our last hope. Look after him. Gagan. Vasu is my last hope, too. God will take care of him. Let's go, son. Do you understand, Vasu? In this test of love, you must make flowers blossom in stones. You must give Rajeshwar his friendship and his innocence back. Now go. Help me! Karan! Come here! Karan! My son! Here's your gun. Thank you, son. Come. Mahendra Singh, that's not how you thank someone. This is how. Here, son. You've been very brave. May you live long. Uncle, you gave that boy your precious ring for something so trivial? It wasn't trivial, son. He saved your life. And you mean the world to me and Mahendra Singh. You must think of setting a date for Radha's marriage, Rajeshwar. I already am. You? Yes. - What brings you here? I came to return your ring. What for? - I want a job, not the ring. Of course, you will have it. Sit down. What is your name? - Krishna. Are you educated? Not much, but I'm sensible. You are sensible? Then answer a few questions. Very well. What does work give you? Money. And hard work? - Bears fruit. What does an employer's order mean? - It's the servant's life. What is the greatest relationship? Friendship. Friendship? Why? Because friendship is from the heart, not from your relatives. Who is the most dangerous enemy? An old friend. I liked your last answer the most. You have passed the test. - Thank you, sir. Thank you! Thank you! Calm down, stop crying. Why should he be quiet? He's a gift from the palace. Sister, be quiet. Why did you bring this nuisance home? Someday those devils will bomb this place. Should I have thrown him in the gutter? Give the baby to me. - Yes, dear. You placate him. Come to me. No baby, no crying. He stopped crying the moment you held him. That's a miracle. Must be related to her. The child only knows love. Absolutely right. Look, this baby is your responsibility now. A burden off my head. The baby is quiet. So is my elder sister. Both are quiet. Have mercy on me. I'll be ruined. I'm expecting your child. - What nonsense! Please save me. I beseech you. Don't you dare tell anyone! I won't leave. - Go! No! - I'll thrash you! You? You mustn't hit a woman, my friend. Are you her husband? - No, you are. It's your duty to protect not hit her. You're preaching to me! You hit my friend? - He... This rascal was showing off his punches! I see. Let me see them too. You - Show me your punches. No sir, you're my master. It's not right to hit you. What did you say? Come on, scoundrel. Show me your punches. - Listen to me... Show the scoundrel! Rascal! Now I'll teach you! Sir! Mr. Rajeshwar. Sir!! He harasses girls. I stopped him, so he hit me! No, sir! I didn't do anything! I am innocent. No, you are not innocent. Let him go. Answer this. - Yes sir. What do you call someone who commits atrocities? A sinner. And the one tolerating injustice? A bigger sinner. - So you're a greater sinner. I will punish you. Take this pistol and shoot him. Me? - Yes. Respect of power is important. But it shouldn't turn to cowardice. Shoot him. Why did you miss? I obeyed your command. You ordered me to shoot him. Not to kill him. 2 lives would have been lost if I'd killed him. The lives of that woman and her unborn child. Did you guys hear that? I dug into the mountain and discovered this gem. And you were dragging him over stones. I gave you power and you committed an injustice. I gave him power and he was just. That's the difference between you and him. He spared your life so you marry this girl. And his reward will be to always be by my side. Come with me. What's wrong with Papa? - God knows. From where have you come? - From Khatagpur. Or Sanatanpur? From Khatagpur. Whose son are you? I'm an orphan. Where did you learn marksmanship? - Father was in the army. Why are you here? - For 2 square meals. Stick to that. If you try to intrude... Keep in mind, I'm better with guns. I know, sir. - Let him go. Kunal was in delhi when Amla was killed. He wasn't here. - This has been proved, Dada Veer This child is Kunal's. And he will go there. If he legally agrees to it, fine. If he doesn't agree, we'll make him agree with bullets. Be patient. The matter is lying with the court. We can't shed the blood of thousands for one child... The Pali Nagar residents initiated the shedding of blood. What were you eavesdropping? - Nothing uncle. Hear this carefully. If you want to stay in this house, shut your eyes and ears. Yes. Keep an eye on her. Radha! Finished cleaning the house? Yes sir. But the room downstairs is locked. - The key is probably with you. - That room is Radha's. The key is always with me. What are you doing? I found two pieces of a painting. I'm putting it together. What painting? - This one. I found it when I was cleaning downstairs. I was sure it was you and a very dear friend. I thought of sticking it and hanging it on a wall. Isn't it beautiful? I'm sorry sir. I hurt you. Yes and you hurt me quite a bit. This was my best friend but now... he's my greatest enemy. Sir, who is he? He is known as Veer Singh. - That Veer Singh? - How do you know him? There are lots of stories about you and Veer Singh. What kind of? That you're very nice but Veer Singh is not really... Get some soda. Get me soda. Everyone says liquor burns the heart. Liquor is consumed only when the heart burns. Meaning? You're still a child. You won't understand. Sir, after seeing your justice, now I like you ever more. What justice? You forced Shyam into accepting his child. It was his child. He should accept it. May I ask something? - Yes. Then shouldn't Kunal accept his child? Go. Did I say something wrong? Just go away. Listen... That wasn't only about the child. It was about Veer Singh. That man had come to publicly humiliate me! He had come to belittle my family! Did Kunal tell me that child was his? Would you accept it if Kunal said so? No. No way. These are such deep wounds of life that you can't comprehend. You may go. - Sorry, sir. I hurt you. You're a funny boy. First you break my heart, then you apologise. My grandpa too would say the same. Grandpa? I'm sure he's very intelligent. Forgive me, sir. This is the key to Radha's room. Henceforth you'll look after it. The master's command is the servant's life. Remember one thing. Henceforth never take the name of my enemy. Settle my family now, I like Radha a lot. Have you asked her whether she likes you? As if she's a princess! Where can she find such a groom? 3 acres of land. Single. Go. It's fixed. Betel leaf... Let this month go by. - Aunt... What? This girl's life is made... ...she's fortunate to come here or she'd be wandering around. ♫ ILU. ♫ ♫ ILU. ♫ ♫ ILU. ♫ Shut the windows, darling... the enemy will cast an eye on you. ♫ Until the mountains of sorrows dissolve... ♫ ♫ ...and we meet each other... ♫ ♫ Don't complaint and don't remember me... ♫ ♫ You don't remember me... ♫ ♫ What to do, but I remember you... ♫ ♫ ...even if I don't want to...

I will decide where will she be married to... ...Where will she sit, stand etc. It is only me who will decide. - Me? Has she cast a magic on you? Aunt this girl was lying till today. What? - Lie? She is not Sumitra's daughter. ...but is my cousin, Amita's daughter. Her mother was my childhood friend... ...and belonged to a very rich family. What? She will no more work as a servant in this house... ...but will live like a queen. Mother... - Come dear. Mother... Wipe your tears and come with me. I was thinking same thing... ...that our Radha dear, belongs to a royal family. Do you know, his father was a respectable man in our village. - Is that so? - Yes. And Amita was so giving. Do you hear how she's praising her childhood friend? Of course. She was a dear friend. As if we were enemies. But now he is my foe. Sworn foe! Won't even spare my kids! Grandpa, you too are the enemy of his kids. Radha. - Yes. Serve dinner. What did she say? What would she know of our story? As if she'd know our story. There's party in the hall. Why didn't you go? You sit with me. What will I do with those illiterates? What do I say? To whom do I explain? It's good that my craziness was put to some use. Craziness is another name for madness. Meaning? It Means... This Rajeshwar was mad right from childhood. But mother said you were great friends in childhood. Weren't you? - That was as kids. We were fools. Had no sense. Do you know any songs? I know one. Which one? The tamarind tree... the raspberry fruit... Sir, shall I sing it? - Pour me some soda. Serve me dinner. Don't talk of the enemy while serving dinner. The picture that you were putting together... He and I would sing this song. This song. - I heard he used to teach you. Veer Singh... taught Rajeshwar Singh! That illiterate? He still can't speak his mother tongue. Krishhna, he never went to school. Not inside, dear, I'd stand outside the school. I'd be waiting for him. I'd give him hot milk to drink every night. I see so that his mind would be cool. So he'd study well. And progress in life. He did become a big man. He's a big trader but his heart is this small. I loved him so much! I used to push his bullock cart. I once broke my leg pushing his cart. When his leg broke, I tied my leg up. I had pledged... I'd stand on one foot for 7 days and I did. Really? He won't understand friendship! I didn't forget him abroad either. From Raju he came Rajeshwar Singh. He changed so much. He cheated me terribly. My sister Pali Kanta committed suicide because of him. In return what a wound he gave me. He had my young son Vishal murdered. I went to pay condolence to Vishal's grief. And he had me jailed under the false allegation of murder. Did I get him jailed? Who laid out that trap? He's got snakes and scorpions as pets. I won't give him a drop of water if he asks for it! I won't give it! Betrayer! Arrogant! Illiterate! Stubborn! Unschooled! Cheat! Number one cheat! I say... Why am I narrating this to you? Look, dear... you are family, aren�t you? Yes! Sometimes emotions bubble over. But all that I said to you must remain between us. All right. - Don't tell anyone. Not to anyone. And him... I won't spare him. Does that mean you can never be united? No, never. Uncle, you've trapped us in a drama! Life is a drama. Today we must teach a lesson to the champion of this drama. He's coming. Have you understood?

May be old but after today these ears mustn't hear it. The world sings it. Maybe but you won't. I will sing. You'll sing it? - Yes. You'll sing it? - Yes. I will. Then you won't stay in my house. What? Does this mean you'll throw me out? No, not from home I'll throw you out of the village! - What? That's nice. I took your grandson to heaven. And this is how you treat my child. Great. - It's not about treatment. It's not that. She... was singing that song. Do you own that song? You've turned into Hitler! If you had your way, you'd abolish the prayers! 'Om Jai Jagish one' We're not talking about it. It's about that song. It hurts my heart. Stones don't get hurt. Come, my dear. No need to stay with this stone. Stay with me. What is it? Where are you taking her? Why. Is she related to you? - Related? You're asking me that? You're asking me... when she's become a piece of my heart! Piece? That is why you broke her heart into pieces. What do you mean? - I mean... When you want to join those pieces, come to me. Then I'll send her. Come, dear. Radha, my dear!

You've got cataract in your eyes! You've grown old. You can't see. But you were singing his song! - See... - Does that song belong to his father? Thakur Rajeshwar Singh. Rajeshwar Singh! Where are you hiding? In the palaces! Come out! Come out and see who stands before you. This is Dada Veer! He's earned some money... And thinks he's great guns! Great guns! You've grown so big on this very earth! Now you've forgotten your poor brethren! You studied in the school near The ditch. Have you forgotten? You didn't know how to tie the drawstrings! I taught you! Didn't I? And now watch the fun. He challenges me! He Challenges me! He Challenges me! He sits in bars and Has English Parties! Drinks English liquor! Damn bloody fool, go from here. Drinks English. Come down here to mother earth. And drink the local brew! Then talk to me. He's got his gun! And shooting the sky! If you must shoot, fire at my chest! The tamarind tree, the raspberry fruit... The tamarind is sour the berries are sweet. There's just one tiger in this forest. Just one tiger. Michael Thapa deposited 2 crores in your name in a Hong Kong bank. But I still haven't got papers of this property. What are you saying sir? My son Monty is soon going to be the son-in-law of this family. After that all of Palinagar is yours. I do not know Monty, I do business. Not rate with Michael Thapa. Okay. So you don't approve the match between Radha and Karan. Of course I approve. But keeping the risk of Sanatanpur in mind... I feel it's better that Radha marry in the family. That's the best. Do you have a boy in mind? I meant Monty. Your son, Monty. Yes. You are elder. You can slap me. We hear you got a resounding slap. Yes. I won't stay in this house, you Choooniya! What? I see great fury in Michael Thapa's dark glasses. Arrange for the papers. With Rajeshwar's signature. Uncle... Kunal. Uncle. I am ashamed at what I did. That is my child. I accept it. Only you can save me from grandpa. Please uncle I beg you! Baliram. Cut the telephone. And wait for me. By God. Save me uncle, please. Baby... Do as I say. Okay uncle. You shouldn't have come here! Try to understand . This is my child. I've come to take him. Chuniya Uncle sent me. Chuniya Uncle? He wants to destroy us! I will not let you take this child! You're refusing your brother? Yes because I can't forget Vasu's struggle! For the past 3 months he has been slogging like a servant in our house! He's in Pali Nagar? - Yes. He's grandpa's servant. And I'm a servant here. Listen to me, come home. There's only danger here! No!!! Mother! Catch her! Radha! Quick, run away! Sister-in-law! Uncle... What are you doing? Vasu. Isn't you name Vasu? - No! The rascal is lying! - No! I'll show you! Tell us the truth... or! Tell us, aren't you Veer Singh's child? Son, own it yourself... Your life will be saved. Else... Yes, I now confess that I'm Dada Veer Singh's grandson! I am Vishal's son! But I haven't come her to kill anyone. I came here with a message of love. A message of love. Keep this in mind. This man is the reason of the Mahabharat between you and grandpa. Beware of this snake in the grass! Leave him and answer my questions. At this moment. I can't answer anything. Why? - Because I made a promise. He's calling me! Catch him! - Yes! No! You will stay here. - Why? We send soldiers not foxes on hunt. Gaja, you go after him. What problem are you creating? Tomorrow is Holi and all guests have come for this party. I had no option but to seek refuge here. Don't you know I've invited Dada Veer and Rajeshwar? It'll be a disaster if they come. Disaster has already struck. Now only... Stop it. - Vaasu. Radha. No... no. Look, one error on your part can kill many innocents. Boys catch them. They say, for centuries, people who love are killed in your world. But today there won't be murder but suicide. If anyone tries to touch us... We will plunge into this Fire and kill ourselves. This is a promise to us.

Swear by God, I'd have shot a bullet in your chest. You son of Baliram! Rajeshwar's dead fingers too can stop your bullet. Shoot. - You'll be the loser. Chuniya makes and he also destroys. The man is a real rascal! He had you imprisoned for 14 years murder he made me commit. He sold every inch of Pali Nagar to Michael Thapa. You are now nude. There's one advantage to signing.

Move away. Let me be. Move away! Move away! Baliram, I'll kill you. No, Raju! Leave him! He'll die anyway. - He took Radha's name! He dishonored me! - He's just a stray dog! Leave him! I won't leave him! I will kill him! He took Radha's name! Brought me dishonour! He's the same guy who got thrashed by me as a kid. He was a rascal and still is. - He's not a rascal. You're supporting him! Leave him! He'll lick your shoes all his life. Leave him! I won't leave him. I'll kill him today! Leave me. - No! You let that stupid dog escape. - Yes, I did. Have you gone mad? If you were arrested, his job would be done. But have you thought what will happen to you? Did you think? You will stand in the court as a murderer! Once again the same jail. With its bars. Rigorous imprisonment for 14 years. These impotent beasts! Raising walls between hearts. The poison which runs through your heart like a fester... It runs up and down... They sowed that seed. They sowed that hatred! Forget what happened. And drink some liquor. Cheers. Here comes the group. Happy Holi, sir. Thank you Sharma. Dada Veer... I'll play Holi with you first. It's been years since Dada Veer played Holi. Why? Just didn't feel like it. Did something happen? You may consider it so? Somebody close had died. He had died. Spit out the anger, Holi is a festival of love. I said do anything but don't throw colour on me. We're soldiers. We can use force. For 35 years nobody dared. To colour me by force. Yes colonel.

Kunal ran away with the child. The entire village is chasing him. There's going to be a great storm. One day your father left like this and never returned. That is why I must go. I have to see whether the flute of love wins or the sword of hatred. Vasu. Vasu. Scoundrel! You're back? Come Radha. Let's show them what revolt is. Stop, Radha! Scoundrel! Lord Rama has sent me to protect love. Radha, come to me. Vasu. Children... Don't be scared, my children. Rajeshwar fired me after serving him for 40 years. You've only been here 4 months. Rajeshwar is the enemy of love and trust. Anyway I'll get both of you married. Right now, And I'll see who dares lifts a finger! We'll calm Devan with love and send him away. By spreading the fire of hatred among children and innocent people... A man can become king of Palinagar and Sanatanpur. But he forgets that the fire consumes him in the end. Dada Veer and Rajeshwar, now I want to see... ...how you will stop this storm? How will you put out this fire? These wires have been electrocuted. - By God. And an explosive has been planted on that gate. It'll blow up any car. Proceed. He is shot sir. - Really. Scoundrel! Gagan, I won't spare you alive! You won't kill Gagan! I will kill their whole family! No, Gagan and Vasu are the kids of my friend! My own kids! The chords of our friendship are joined, my son. You've become friends, not us. I won't let these beggars rule my throne! - No, Gaja... - Your Vasu on my child... Gaja! Gajja, hold my hand. Listen to me. Forget the Bad blood between us at least now. Accept my hand of friendship. Let's be one, my brother! It's now too late, kids. No! No! Your groom. - No! Before they come, you'll be married to me not Vasu. Vasu sir. Vasu! - Catch her! Vasu. Vasu. Radha! - Vasu! What's happening here? The race to marry Radha. Vasu or Monty. Vasu. Vasu. Look. Poison. Yes. We have no other choice now. ILU... ILU... ILU... ILU... ILU... ILU... ILU... ILU? ILU? What's that? ILU... Let Vasu go! Leave him! Hang him! No! I won't live! I won't live! Radha, Rajeshwar and I... - Are the biggest enemies! You are merchants of hate! All right, today I'll show you... The friendship between us enemies. Come with me. - No! I won't come! - Come with me. See the friendship of us enemies. He has come. - Let him. He is dashing. Grandpa! Radha dear, are you all right? Where is Veeru? - Look there. Veeru... Veeru... Where are you? I'm sitting here. On top of this tree. Near you. We'll annihilate the enemy! Hey Chuniya! You snake in the grass! Come out! You kept my pal away from me for years! You killed my Vishal! Today if you as much as touch our children... Only your skeleton will be seen here. You're bleeding, you fool! My pal it's blood. Let it bleed. The tamarind plant and the the raspberry tree... The tamarind is sour, the berries sweet... Raju! Move! Grandpa! Grandpa! No! No! This can't be true! No! My pal, what have you done? Those bullets were for me... - Nothing, my pal. Don't do anything. I bind you by our friendship. I'm absolutely fine. I've waited a lifetime for you. Veeru even I've lived for you. Only you. Don't ever leave this hand. - I'll never leave your hand, Veeru. I'll get Vasu and put him in your lap. While you watch I'll get Chuniya and throw him at your feet. I'll thrash him in front of you. Don't you worry. I'll be back soon. - I'll be here. I am here. He is coming, sir. Let him come. Hold on... Enough shooting. Talk business. My men didn't shoot you because we want your signature. I'm ready to sign your dream. But I have two conditions. Let us know. And sign here. Let him go. You gave us the fort. We give Chuniya to you. Let's go. - Michael Thapa... Brother-in-law... Sir Rajeshwar... You murdered my friendship. Today I want your blood. Your blood. I won't spare you! You touched my kids! No, I won't spare you! Chuniya... No Chuniya... I'm not dying like this. I'm going to make you pay for my friend's death. I'll take you to Veeru's feet! Veeru... I've brought this dog to your feet! I won't let you off easily. Get up and crush him with foot. Get up. Veeru. This can't be happening. This isn't true. I told you to wait. This is not fair to me. Rajeshwar! Fire! Vasu.
