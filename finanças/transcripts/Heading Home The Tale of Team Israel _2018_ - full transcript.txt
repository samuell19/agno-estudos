CODY DECKER Every four years Major League Baseball puts on the World Baseball Classic. It's basically the baseball equivalent to the World Cup. MARIA BARTIROMO Joining me right now to talk about it is MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. ROB MANFRED It gives us a chance to give fans around the world an opportunity to see the best players in the world. CODY DECKER Only 16 teams get to qualify. REPORTER I have Puerto Rico beating the reigning champions the Dominican Republic. PREDICTOR 2 The US is going to win. CODY DECKER When I found out that Israel was going to have a team, I didn't... I thought it was a pipe dream; I never thought it was going to happen. RYAN LAVARNWAY I think my... my agent contacted me and he said, "Hey, I got a call. Israel's playing in the qualifier for the WBC. Would you be interested?" JOSH ZEID I'm very proud to be Jewish. There's no better stage, no better team. It's my favorite game in the world. Why not play? MARGO SUGARMAN These are professional baseball players. For a lot of them this was long time in coming, to get redemption from 2012 when they just, just missed getting into the WBC. JOSH ZEID In 2012 when we played Spain, I blew it. ANNOUNCER Yunesky SÃ¡nchez singles to center. That's his fourth hit of the game. JOSH ZEID I didn't have what it took to finish the game, and it... I mean it killed me inside. VENDOR Corn dogs! Who's hungry? Corn dogs here. Build up your appetite. Corn dogs! RYAN LAVARNWAY The guys that had played in 2012 said, "Hey, we're back to finish what we started last time." We're like, "Man, like it meant that much to you?" MARGO SUGARMAN One thing that was clear in Brooklyn, Team Israel was a crowd favorite. We were the home team. Yeshiva schoolkids sitting in the stands with their kippot on, waving Israeli flags. PAUL SEVERINO This went right back to Zeid. JOSH ZEID In 2012, I got the loss. In 2016, I got the win in the qualifying game. PAUL SEVERINO Chris Berset is up, the last hope for Great Britain. CODY DECKER Winning that tournament in Brooklyn ... PAUL SEVERINO Slow roller towards second, the play to first. CODY DECKER ... it was the best moment of my career. PAUL SEVERINO And Israel is headed to Seoul in March. CODY DECKER It was that first time I ever felt like I won, like I really won, because it's not about my career, it's not about any of our careers; it's about something bigger. PAUL SEVERINO Chris Berset is up, the last hope for Great Britain. Two on and two out in the top of the ninth inning. Slow roller towards second, the play to first. And Israel is headed to Seoul in March. PETER KURZ Here we are at MCU Park in Brooklyn, Coney Island, getting ready for our first practice, as you can see in the background. My name is Peter Kurz. I'm the General Manager of Team Israel in the WBC. PETER KURZ According to the rules of the WBC, they have what's called a Heritage Rule. Anybody who can gain citizenship in a country can also play for that country in the WBC. The host Spanish team four years ago, there was one Spanish guy and the rest were all from South America, but they could get Spanish citizenship so they were allowed to play for Spain. MAN Alright guys, we're going to do one row sitting on the ground cross-legged. PETER KURZ Anybody who is Jewish or who has Jewish parents or grandparents can get citizenship in Israel, so anybody who is Jewish can also play for Team Israel. We're playing against South Korea, which is 50 million people. Taiwan is huge, The Netherlands is huge, United States, huge populations. There's only 15 million Jewish people in the world. We started looking around. In terms of starting pitching, I mean obviously Marquis is going to be the starter. Jason Marquis had retired. The first time I called he was in Disneyland with his kids. JASON MARQUIS They went on a ride, uh, and I was sitting there on a bench and I discussed it with my wife and what she thought so, I committed to playing. PETER KURZ He said, "You know what? I'm... I'm looking to make a comeback and maybe this could be the comeback." We've got Zeid. We've got Baker. We've got Bleich. Is he there? Where did I put him? The great challenge is finding the guys without the Jewish names. ANNOUNCER Ty Kelly with his first major league home run! TY KELLY My dad's side of the family is Irish and Catholic and my mom's side of the family is Polish and Jewish. PETER KURZ By chance, a guy called me up. "My kid had a yarmulke on him and Ty Kelly came over and signed some autographs and said he was Jewish." STEVE GELBS What is your excitement level about getting over to South Korea and getting going in that tournament? TY KELLY Uh, I'm very excited. Should I look at you or should I look up there at the camera? STEVE GELBS Either one. You can look at me. TY KELLY Okay. Yeah, I mean it was a no-brainer. I got an email from Peter Kurz ... As long as the Mets were okay with it, I... I was going to go. He asked if I had a Jewish grandparent, and the rest is history. Manager JERRY WEINSTEIN I mean our shortstop, we got him off of Facebook, because his mom looked Jewish. SCOTT BURCHAM My manager came up to me, asked me if I was Jewish, which is kind of a random question to ask. They clicked my mom's Facebook, they saw she is from New York. A lot of Jewish people live in New York apparently. PETER KURZ I'm definitely in favor of Burcham playing shortstop and putting Kelly in the outfield. A potential player had to prove that his grandparent or his parents were Jewish. One player sent us a picture of his grandfather's tombstone, which has a Jewish star on it. They actually sent me marriage certificates from their parents. One guy sent me his grandfather's dog tags from World War II. MLB didn't accept that. They said, "Listen, dog tags you can find in 42nd Street in some store. You can pick up dog tags." SAM FULD My dad dug up some old documentation and that was it. I don't know who Peter then runs that by to... to confirm that I'm Jewish, but it's enough. PETER KURZ There was a guy who we were trying for quite a few weeks to get him to prove that he's Jewish. Uh, the best we could get was his great-grandmother was Jewish. Has to be a grandparent. Which, ironically, is also the Nazi rule of who was a Jew in Nazi Germany but, uh, maybe don't include that in... in your... in your movie. NATASHA KIRTCHUK Many people don't associate Israel with baseball, but you'd be surprised just how much excitement there is ahead of the World Baseball Classic. For the first time, there's going to be 10 American Jewish Major League Baseball players on the Israeli team. These US athletes are now preparing to be in Israel next month, which will include visits to the greatest destinations the country has to offer. This is clearly the most impressive Jewish baseball team ever assembled. JONATHAN MAYO I have always been very interested in the Jews in baseball. From the time when I was a kid I just wanted people to identify with. My grandmother always wanted to know the Jewish actors. It was always a short conversation when it came to sports. There's a scene in Airplane where there's a woman and she's like, "I'm looking for some light reading." WOMAN Do you have anything light? JONATHAN MAYO And the flight attendant says, "How about this pamphlet about Jews in sports?" ELAINE DICKINSON Famous Jewish Sports Legends. WOMAN Yes, thank you. JONATHAN MAYO And it's like a one page leaflet. It always used to make me mad because I had this big Jews in sports book. I'm just excited to go to Israel with this group of Jewish baseball players, most of them for the first time. Ike Davis had a huge rookie year with the Mets, hit over 30 homers. I remember the first time I heard that he might be Jewish, so I was like, "Wait, what?" And then I, you know... the... when was it that people first started realizing that, you know... that you are a Jewish baseball player? IKE DAVIS You know, my... my mom was Jewish and my dad was Baptist growing up, so technically by law, yeah, I am... uh, I am Jewish, for sure. JONATHAN MAYO During the last season with the Pirates... GREG BROWN Ike Davis with a drive deep to right centerfield. Look at this baby. Clear the deck! JONATHAN MAYO Greg Brown, play-by-play guy, gave a big "mazel tov" when you hit a big homer. GREG BROWN Yeah, mazel tov! JONATHAN MAYO What made you that you were like, alright, I'm... I'm... I'm okay with that? IKE DAVIS Well, uh, you know, I have blood, you know, and uh, you can't really hide from that. Every city I go to, I get yelled at, "Hey Ike, I'm Jewish too, and we're here to root you on." You don't even know these people and you're playing their... their city's team, but they're rooting for you. JOSH ZEID I've worn a Jewish star since I was about 12 years old, since my bar mitzvah, ooh, that's not it. Here it is. How cool would it be to go to Israel? ANNOUNCER And the strikeout for Zeid. JOSH ZEID I missed my chance because of professional baseball and because of college baseball and then high school baseball and I think everyone's the same way. JONATHAN MAYO Thank you very much. JOSH ZEID That looks amazing. This looks kosher. People in America like baseball cause everybody played it as a baby. JONATHAN MAYO Right. JOSH ZEID As a little kid or... JOSH ZEID ...first toy was a little baseball. Would we include baseball in Israel, you know, with... with kids? JONATHAN MAYO Yeah, I think some sort of clinic kind of thing. Maybe a one... a one-time kind of deal as part of that I think would be... would be a good idea. JOSH ZEID I think that would be really cool. I mean... JONATHAN MAYO Right, yeah. JOSH ZEID I would... I would enjoy that, I think. Other guys would enjoy it too. JONATHAN MAYO As far as I know, there's only one real baseball field in the entire country. JOSH ZEID That's mind-blowing. JONATHAN MAYO Uh-huh. Well, it's not a thing there really. JOSH ZEID Yet. MARGO SUGARMAN We all got to know this team in Brooklyn at the qualifiers and they're ballplayers. I don't want to say they're robots, but they work out. If they've got a game, they play their game. PAUL SEVERINO New pitcher Jeremy Bleich takes over. MARGO SUGARMAN This is what they do. Suddenly to introduce this emotional aspect of coming to Israel, coming home, it's a whole other ballgame. JEREMY BLEICH I'm Jeremy Bleich. I'm a baseball player. But experiences that I've gone through by playing the game have kind of opened up who I am. I opened up an email from Peter Kurz. It said, "Hey, we're taking a handful of guys to Israel." RYAN LAVARNWAY And I was like, "For real? Like yes!" JEREMY BLEICH "You're gonna be flown over in a private jet." RYAN LAVARNWAY Are you kidding me? Who would say no to this? donated his private jet for Team Israel's flight. JEREMY BLEICH A few of the guys that I saw when I first got on the plane were guys that I played with in Brooklyn, Cody Decker. JON MOSCOT Cody Decker in his throne. JEREMY BLEICH Ryan Lavarnway, Ike Davis, Sam Fuld, Josh Zeid. And then there were some new guys. TY KELLY Ty. Nice to meet you! JEREMY BLEICH Nice to meet you! Ty Kelly I had never met. JOSH ZEID We got to bring our families. RYAN LAVARNWAY I brought Jamie. Josh brought Stephanie. Cody brought Jenn. Sam brought his dad. Ty brought his mom. JEREMY BLEICH You see video guys. You see some guys that supported trip financially. You see all these different pieces coming together. JEREMY BLEICH And it's like an "oh shit" moment. These people are doing their job, but what's my job? CODY DECKER We were flown out to Israel to see what it was we were playing for. JOSH ZEID Not necessarily a team building, but a country building awareness trip to a country that we didn't know much about. PILOT Welcome to Tel Aviv! Temperature is 63 degrees. MAN Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. PETER KURZ Sam, good to see you! PETER KURZ Alright, good to see you, man. IKE DAVIS Good to see you, Peter. PETER KURZ Good to see you, man. JEFF AEDER Alright Jon, come on over here for one second. JOSH ZEID Thank you so much! Do you want to click one of you with your girl? RYAN LAVARNWAY We didn't really know what we were getting into. IKE DAVIS I was jet-lagged, hadn't slept for 24 hours, hadn't showered in like 36 hours. All of a sudden I was getting dragged into a circle with rabbis dancing like crazy. One thing you think about when playing for Israel, a lot of people don't like Jewish people, and it... I mean forever. So it's... it's not like something you... you really want to have, you know, a Jewish tattoo on your forehead. I was a little nervous. PETER KURZ I just want to welcome everybody here. It's fantastic seeing you all here. There'll be a lot of reporters following us. Have fun, that's the most important thing. Thanks! REPORTER Thank you very much for the interview! IKE DAVIS Yeah. REPORTER How does it feel... how does it feel to be in Israel? IKE DAVIS Growing up away from Israel and... and not really around a lot of Jewish people, I don't know how much Israel means to me. So coming here is really, really cool to hopefully dive in and learn a lot more about, you know, my history. RYAN LAVARNWAY Throughout the Jewish history, you know, there's been persecution. There's been dislike. There's been all these things. And there are some places where we're still not accepted. I just want to spread more positivity and more love. Um, and I'm happy to... to wear Israel on my chest. REPORTER So they recruited you, they said? JOSH ZEID Yes, well, yes, they recruited me and I recruited myself. I'm proud of who I am and baseball kind of took me away and now it's bringing me back. JEFF AEDER He's a great guy to talk to, so he's going to be around and I can't thank him enough for making introductions and being part of this trip. DAVID MAKOVSKY I'm uh, a native of St. Louis, Missouri. I'm a fanatical, fanatical St. Louis Cardinals fan. Israelis and Palestinians have been at loggerheads for 100 years. United States has tried to hit a home run about three times in the last 16 years to end this conflict, solve the whole deal: Clinton in 2000, then Condoleezza Rice in 2008, then Kerry in 2014. You guys know better than anybody, when you try to swing for the fences, you often strike out. They can make incremental progress but they... they hit the wall on the core issues. What we need now is some singles and doubles. JOSH ZEID Did you guys make a wish at the Wish Bridge? JAMIE LAVARNWAY We were with you. It's like you forgot we existed. RYAN LAVARNWAY You went onto the bridge because we were on the bridge. JOSH ZEID I was... I was so deep into my wish though. I had... I had to preface my wish by saying that it was a loaded wish. RYAN LAVARNWAY What did you ask for? JOSH ZEID It's like a birthday candle. I can't just... JAMIE LAVARNWAY That's literally, exactly what I said. RYAN LAVARNWAY I wasn't going to tell you either, but I was just seeing if you would tell me. JOSH ZEID I'll tell you what I wished for. I wished... I wished that my facial hair wouldn't grow as fast. I shaved this morning. CODY DECKER I'm Cody Decker. ANNOUNCER Decker has got his first Major League hit, but his first RBI. CODY DECKER I was just meeting up with some teammates at a bar one night. And these girls were talking to us and someone mentioned that I was Jewish. And the girls were like appalled and sickened that I was a Jew. The girls are like saying to the guys like, "We don't want him at the table." To which the guys are like, "Okay, bye girls. Hitler Youth is over there. Take it easy." I'll remember that for the rest of my life. That situation showed me that how I grew up wasn't normal. Santa Monica, California was a really big melting pot. GUY SHARETT Tel Aviv is very liberal, open-minded, LGBTQ, women empowering. Jerusalem is orthodox, it's politics. Tel Aviv, I told you, we want to have nipples out. We want to be party all night. The great way for you to understand Israel is its graffiti. CODY DECKER The ambience of Tel Aviv, that's how it was in Santa Monica. Santa Monica's little league was filled with Jewish kids playing baseball. We always went to Dodger games. We always had our Jewish heroes. JEFF AEDER This is going to be a portrait of Sandy Koufax. GUY SHARETT You see the image right here? CODY DECKER He's Sandy Koufax. He's the king... he's the actual king of Jewish baseball. I think it would be exceedingly nice if us playing baseball and doing well in this tournament impacted how people see Jews in the world. I'm looking forward to the Ike Davis mural. It's in Jerusalem. When you really break it down, we're just playing a game made for 12-year-olds. Will it change things? Probably not but, you know, one can hope. This is going to be dangerous. REPORTER Team Israel, of course, they won the qualifier in Brooklyn. They are on their way to Seoul, South Korea, for pool play in early March. RON DARLING Jonathan, it's Ron Darling. One of my favorite players that I've ever come across is Ike Davis and I saw him in that photograph. How is Ike enjoying the trip? JONATHAN MAYO Uh, he was unbelievable and he was a rock star. A lot of former New Yorkers, a lot of former Mets fans, remember him from his days in New York and he was frequently recognized. IKE DAVIS What's up guys? IKE DAVIS My name is Ike Davis. You guys ready to do this? Yes. Let's get to the field, man. Let's go. My parents are Ron and Millie. My dad is an ex-Major Leaguer, redneck, hillbilly, Baptist. Mom is Jewish and a little bit of a hippy and totally different. No wonder they got divorced. You better go get a selfie stick. That's the only way I'm doing it. You better go find one. BOY Ike Davis cards. IKE DAVIS I got drafted in the first round by the Mets. ANNOUNCER It's outta here. Ike Davis wins it with a pinch-hit grand slam in the bottom of the ninth. IKE DAVIS That was the biggest thing playing in New York, the Jewish spotlight. CHRISTIAN NIEDAN His name is Isaac Benjamin Davis and he's the newest first baseman for the New York Mets. He's also Jewish. FAN We miss you big time. We miss you big time. IKE DAVIS You can't control the media. You know, that stuff is out there. They write whatever they want. I just want to be a ballplayer. No, I was a Jewish ballplayer, so accept it, you know? I had a pretty eye-opening moment. I was doing a family tree. On my dad's side I got like five, six, seven generations. And then on mom's side I got like three people and then it was over. And I was like, "What the... what is this?" You know, and then she... we... she's like, "Well, that's what happens, you know, during the Holocaust. Most of the family didn't make... you know, make it." Well, the field is disgusting. But it is a nice field and the rain kind of ruined the possible practice day. Team Israel to me is not really like a religious thing. CODY DECKER I just want to hear people go, "Ooh, ah," every time Ike hits a baseball. IKE DAVIS It's more remembering the struggles of the Jewish people. Yeah baby. RYAN LARNWAY That's gone. IKE DAVIS Obviously... RYAN LARNWAY That one might have gone to Jerusalem. IKE DAVIS ... if we made it to the championship round or made it out of like Korea, that would be great. TY KELLY That's a single. IKE DAVIS But I mean we're playing tough teams, you know? Like United States hasn't even won this thing, let alone, you know, Israel, so. JONATHAN MAYO And this trip I would imagine teaches you as much as anything else that it's not just about winning. IKE DAVIS No. CODY DECKER Ike, you're up. IKE DAVIS Yeah. That's the greatest part about being Jewish, grit for sure. CODY DECKER Let's go! Put on a show. IKE DAVIS You don't always win. Shit. It makes you tough. And Israelis are tough, you can tell, so. Uh, it's kind of a great sport. It kind of matches up. Come on get up! JOSH ZEID Ike, Ike, Ike, Ike, Ike. PETER KURZ They're going to have Israel across their chest and they're going to play for us in March, but they're all similar to all the kids out here, because they're all Jewish and they're all ballplayers and they're all playing for Israel, like... just like all you guys. Any questions, uh, it's time for questions and answers? BOY Why you come here to Israel and not stay in America? IKE DAVIS Do you want us to leave? Well, we might stay here if you wanted us to. It's just... didn't sound like you didn't. But, um, no, I just think that's what it really... that's what's great about Israel is the fact that if you have Jewish family and Jewish blood from, um, around the... you know, the globe, that you can feel like when you get here, you actually can feel like it's a little bit like home and... and uh... and uh, I think that's what we're here for this week is to find that. YOAV SCHWARTZ Alright, thanks Peter. Great to see everybody! Uh, just very briefly, today we're excited to show the new sign that will go up on Ezra Schwartz Memorial Baseball Field. Ezra's life was cut tragically short in a terrorist attack just one year ago, but his parents, his family, his friends, we're all doing our best to honor his life by focusing on all the things that made Ezra so special. He was the captain of his baseball team and a mentor to younger players. We hope that the dedication of a baseball field in his name in Ra'anana, here in Israel, will be a fitting way to remember a young man who loved kids, sports, and especially baseball. We're going to show this, uh, plaque that will go up on the field. CODY DECKER Right? ZACK RAAB I missed a picture with you last night. I didn't want to bother you right away. CODY DECKER You're not bothering me. JENN STERGER I can take it. Ready? One, two. Look at them handsome guys. CODY DECKER And I'm in the photo too. JENN STERGER Exactly! CODY DECKER Going to Israel, at first, everyone was doing it because, you know, we're Jewish. This is going to be fun. RYAN LAVARNWAY How are you? Good morning! Good morning! JEREMY BLEICH The moment in my trip where I'm like, "What am I doing here?" You see these kids you're like, "This is what I'm here for." MARGO SUGARMAN Suddenly it goes from, "It's a fun experience," to, "I'm representing this country and these kids are going crazy, not leaving me alone." JON MOSCOT Guys, walk with me. Walk with me. Keep walking. MARGO SUGARMAN "I had to sign 150 autographs in five minutes. That's who we're playing for." JOSH ZEID That's my best one today. TEEN Yo, your pitch is sick. JOSH ZEID Thank you so much! TEEN I actually watched that game, you struck out like 10 guys. JOSH ZEID Yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was really fun. It's going to be even more fun when we go to Korea. TEEN It's Netherlands, man, they have a sick team. JOSH ZEID Yeah, they've got good teams, but so do we. TEEN We've got a good team? JOSH ZEID We've got a really good team. TEEN We're going to do good? JOSH ZEID Yeah, we're going to do really good, as long as you're watching. TEEN I'm... definitely, I'm going to watch all the... all the games, get up at three in the morning. -JOSH ZEID Awesome! Is that what it is? Is that what it was? -TEEN I don't know. It's like once every four years and we finally made it. JOSH ZEID That is true, we finally made it. TEEN Last time we didn't manage. -JOSH ZEID I'll... I'll be awake too, so. -TEEN Of course! FATHER We've got Ty Kelly. We've got... we've got Ike Davis. Who else did you get? SON I think we got everybody. JON MOSCOT It was... it was incredible. You can't walk anywhere. I... I signed a yarmulke on the inside. GUIDE Guys, yesterday somebody forgot that on the old bus. IKE DAVIS That was me. I purposefully... CODY DECKER That was on purpose. JOSH ZEID Throw them out the door and say they're Ike's and see what happens. JON MOSCOT Oh gosh, it's literally dangerous, don't do that. JEREMY BLEICH Look at this. Look at this. Here we go. RYAN LAVARNWAY Make... make the kid's day. JEFF AEDER Hey, he's going to give one shoe to you and then one for the other Mets fan. IKE DAVIS Yeah. BOY 1 How much home runs did you have in one game? IKE DAVIS Three. BOY 2 I told you. I told you. And a single, right? IKE DAVIS And a single, yes. BOY 3 If you don't mind, also my jersey. BOY 2 Are you leftie? IKE DAVIS I am a leftie. BOY 3 Bye! Have a nice trip! IKE DAVIS Thank you! JOSH ZEID My name is Josh Zeid. I live in Houston, Texas. I've played baseball since I was five years old. ANNOUNCER The bunt is a good one. Zeid will flip out of his glove and roll over. And he got him. He got him. JOSH ZEID They have whiskey halva. I was bar mitzvahed. That was like taking a shot of whiskey. That was unbelievable. I mean, I... I led the service. I remember giving a... a sermon about Jackie Robinson and inclusion and equality in baseball and the world. We good? Thank you! My wife is Stephanie. She's Lutheran. Your mom would really like that. 19 pieces, that might be hard to put in a suitcase. I don't think either of our families were thrilled that we were dating. I don't think they were extremely happy when we got engaged. You know, in my mind I know it's like a... kind of a peaceful, like unicorns and rainbows view, but, you know, why can't we really all get along? JON MOSCOT Not Israel. -SAMMY Where are you from? -JOSH ZEID I'm from Texas. SAMMY Yeah, where about? -JOSH ZEID Houston, Texas. -SAMMY Houston? So Houston Texans. JOSH ZEID The Houston Astros. SAMMY Oh, Astros. We have also. JOSH ZEID You have Astros here? SAMMY We give you, yes, yes. We give you. Come. Where's the Astros? JOSH ZEID You have a Texans shirt? SAMMY Here is it. JOSH ZEID Oh my goodness! The shop owner Sammy... SAMMY No, we have any size you want. JOSH ZEID ...who was Palestinian. SAMMY What size you want it? Okay, now I want to know, who are you? JOSH ZEID I play professional baseball. SAMMY You are professional baseball? JOSH ZEID In America, yeah. SAMMY Forget about the shirt. Which... which team... which team you play for? JOSH ZEID The Houston Astros a few years ago. This past year I was with the New York Mets. SAMMY See, I want to tell you something. -JOSH ZEID What's that? -SAMMY Playing for the Astros, that means no more rings, no rings at all, and after that when you go... when you go after that to the Mets, that means also nothing. If you want to win, you're supposed to go to big franchise. Go to the Yankees. Go to the Red Sox. JOSH ZEID How many rings do the Yankees have? SAMMY 27. JOSH ZEID Yes, they do. Yes, they do. SAMMY And the... and the... the St. Louis, uh, Cardinals, how many? Answer. JOSH ZEID St. Louis Cardinals, how many, Cardinals? SAMMY Yeah, yeah, it's 11. -JOSH ZEID She knows everything, not me. -SAMMY It's 11. Correct or not? It's 11. -JOSH ZEID I think it's 11. SAMMY It's 11. JOSH ZEID We asked him if he would root for Team Israel, especially knowing that now Team Israel was going to be full of American Jews. SAMMY You know something? Nowadays it's not that easy. I'll be honest with you. I don't have to lie. It's not that easy. No, no, no, I don't want to go politics, honestly, it's not that easy. SHOP OWNER Understand me, but the problem they don't look at us as Israeli. We are living here, but we are not Israeli. For example, we don't have passport. And we are in 21 century? No? No passport. No... no passport. We don't elect anything, you know? We are nothing. And then you are in, what they call it, the only free country in the Middle East. Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you! Good luck! COFFEE SHOP OWNER I hope one day they'll have, you know, Palestinian team from throwing stones. JOSH ZEID Bodies by falafel. COREY BAKER You mind getting my back, buddy? JOSH ZEID Yes, my friend. COREY BAKER Thank you. Oh, this is beautiful. SAM FULD Nice. JENN STERGER That's not how abs look. CODY DECKER Hold on, hold on, hold on. JENN STERGER I forget that... I forget that Cody doesn't know what abs look like. CODY DECKER Ha, ha, ha, ha. I don't know what abs look like. I get it. Ha, ha, ha, ha. RYAN LAVARNWAY Oh, it burns! CODY DECKER I shaved my back yesterday. It's all open wounds. It's all open wounds. Oh my God! SAM FULD I don't think there's a team out there which likes to joke around as much as us. We have this unique bond, which I think goes beyond just the heritage. And then when we got that news, it was a reminder of where we were. MARGO SUGARMAN For those of you who don't know, and please don't be upset or panicked, I just want to let you know what went on. At one o'clock today there was a terror attack. A guy took a truck and rammed into some pedestrians in a neighborhood in Jerusalem. The team had been staying in Jerusalem, but we had gone down to Masada that day so we were away from Jerusalem. JEREMY BLEICH I got... just got text messages from my sister and brother who were just waking up on the East Coast. Obviously the chances are slim that anything had happened to me, but they were like freaking out that, you know... and you just think about how many people are probably going through the same thing and then you... people that it actually happened to, it's just horrible to think about. JON MOSCOT Oh my God! That's a big truck. REPORTER Whenever the Israeli soccer team goes somewhere to Europe, there's a lot of animosity, there's signs, anti-Israel. Are you worried about that, do you see that, do you get that? SAM FULD Not that we're Jackie Robinson, but the reason he was such a pioneer was he was so brave in being able to block all that stuff out. And I think he got... he went through something far different than what lays in store for us, but if there's any sort of that negativity, I think, in order for us to do our best on the field, it's not our job to... to focus on that. CODY DECKER The Western Wall was just a sea of people praying. I did not realize how much that was going to hit me. RYAN LAVARNWAY I kind of stood there for a second and then I just felt this sense of something bigger. JOSH ZEID It's peculiar. I wrote a note and I put it in the wall and I started just talking. I was talking to God. Baseball has kind of jaded me in asking for anything. You never want to sit there and say, "I need one more strikeout." I wasn't asking for things. I was... I was just telling Him things. I was telling Him what I wanted and how we were going to get it done. SAM FULD There's some part of you as a Jew that feels, you don't want to just shout at the top of your lungs, like, "I'm Jewish!" SAM FULD My paternal grandmother, um, all her family were Holocaust survivors. IKE DAVIS Mom's side of the family, most of them died in the Holocaust. JEREMY BLEICH Both my grandparents were in Auschwitz. SAM FULD The Holocaust was only 70 years ago. That's a very short period of time to be confident as Jews to represent Team Israel. LARRY DEKOVEN You guys are going to represent Israel here, right, at the World Baseball Classic. Everybody in Israel, men and women, serve in the military, right? It's part of like life here. Men do three years, women do two years. And you guys representing Israel, you guys are like going to be Israeli warriors. So I got you guys a little something something. It is really very little. Cody Decker, Cody Decker, this is for you. CODY DECKER Thank you so much! LARRY DEKOVEN Ty Kelly. Where's Ty? Ty Kelly, that's for you. Sam Fuld. Josh Zeid. Where's Josh? Ryan Lavarnway. IKE DAVIS The coolest part about this place is the ability to have a home as a Jewish person anywhere you live. If anything ever happens, you can always find a home in Israel. You know, a Jewish-run state actually is pretty cool. And it's not as, you know, weird as you'd think. What's up guys? NATE FREIMAN Alright, we'll make sure he goes on the bench. CODY DECKER Absolutely! JERRY WEINSTEIN You can release him by stepping back, stepping in the hole, or just with the hand, wherever you want. In any business, you're not going to like everybody who works for you, but I like everybody on our team. Oh, glad you can make it! RYAN LAVARNWAY What's going on? JERRY WEINSTEIN Right on, how have you been? The fact that everybody needed to be Jewish... JERRY WEINSTEIN Some are coming off of injuries. We'll take care of your arm. We'll... we'll... we'll make up for it. If it's critical, then we'll take you out and we'll put someone else in. Okay? -Sure! Yeah. Some of them have retired and unretired. Some of them are looking for jobs. They're resistant to the naysayers. Infield in! CODY DECKER Nate Freiman, my teammate on Team Israel, we were playing together in the Texas League in Frisco, Texas. Nate is basically a cell tower on this team. We always had drunk frat boys screaming kike at both of us. And like... I'm like, "What? What the fuck is this?" I almost jumped over the fence and kicked the shit out of them. JERRY WEINSTEIN The other teams have been having camps for 30 days and we've had three. NATE FISH Ready to roll? JERRY WEINSTEIN Yeah, more than ready. JACOBS In Korea, the crowd and the environment over there, it's gonna be absolutely wild. JERRY WEINSTEIN They're gonna have a chant, or a song, or cheerleader doing something all the time. It's not like when the guy's getting ready to pitch, they quiet down. It's... ALEX JACOBS You're gonna be hearing things you've never heard probably before while you're playing the game of baseball. JERRY WEINSTEIN We're not gonna overload you with info. We'll have video on the pitchers. But, if you don't want to look at it, fuck it. Don't look at it. I don't give a shit. We're here because we're good, and we're here because the reason we're good is because you do what you're good at. JEREMY BLEICH Sitting in business class, flying to Korea, watching every movie they had. Walking around and joking with the guys, there's a certain bond here that I've actually never experienced before. And all of a sudden there was an ESPN article about how we were the Jamaican bobsled team. JOHN CANDY Respect! Respect! JOHN In reality, Al, I don't think the Jamaicans have any chance of winning a medal. WOMAN Dear God! JOSH ZEID We were 200-1 favorites to win the World Baseball Classic. MARGO SUGARMAN The odds they were 200-1, which is the bottom of the bottom. ANNOUNCER The welcome reception of the 2017 World Baseball Classic... MARGO SUGARMAN You're not good enough to be on any other team so you got to be in Israel. JEREMY BLEICH I'm gonna use a quote from ESPN, "A lot of these guys are has-beens." SAM FULD Has-beens and wannabes. MARGO SUGARMAN Has-beens and wannabes. RYAN LAVARNWAY I mean it's baseball. BOY Come on Lupus, catch it! RYAN LAVARNWAY At any point, at any point, the worst little league team could beat the New York Yankees. Maybe one out of a million, but on that one day it happens. PETER KURZ Tell everybody, let's go guys. IKE DAVIS Peter, why did you yell at us to get out when the bus isn't here? Nice Peter. PETER KURZ The Israeli Embassy in Korea... JERRY WEINSTEIN Hello! PETER KURZ ...they're going to be having an event for us there. JERRY WEINSTEIN You get any intel on who, who, on who, yeah, on who the Koreans will start? PETER KURZ MLB has their security operations going. They know very well that Team Israel is Team Israel. NADAV PELDMAN Good evening! I would like to say a few words to the team and to the guests here, you know. I am very, very excited to have you here today. I am very excited to host here in Seoul a... a national team from Israel. It's... it's... it's not a small thing, especially for this event, which is the top sixteen in the world. Israel don't have a lot of teams that make it to the top sixteen. Most of the players here are American Jews. Israel always has a connection between all the Jewish people in the world and Israel. And part of what this team is about is about this special connection and... and I think it's amazing. JERRY WEINSTEIN L'chaim! IKE DAVIS We aren't supposed to win by predictions, but I feel like we possibly have a better team than people think and we could, you know, cause a little havoc. IKE DAVIS Tomorrow's our first game. We're playing Korea. We're ready to get this thing rolling. JOSH ZEID You tell a bunch of people who have a lotta fight in 'em that there's no chance, they're gonna give Israel one heck of a fight. IKE DAVIS We got guys with power. Sam Fuld, he's a big league lead-off hitter. JERRY WEINSTEIN Lavarnway, he can really catch and throw and block. IKE DAVIS Ty Kelly's really impressed me. He just knows how to play the game. JERRY WEINSTEIN Ike Davis, he's got a big league rÃ©sumÃ©, a good one. IKE DAVIS Freiman, he's like the biggest Jewish guy I've ever seen. JERRY WEINSTEIN Cody Decker is the social chairman. CODY DECKER Alright, so whoever's sitting back here is going to hold his head up. He's been drinking. JERRY WEINSTEIN He is one little accent in the soup that brings everything together. CODY DECKER That's a changeup. That's a two-seamer. IKE DAVIS Our pitching is really deep. Jason Marquis, he's like 38. That's old in baseball. And I saw him throwing 90 the other day, which was impressive. JONATHAN MAYO Feeling okay? JASON MARQUIS Yeah. JERRY WEINSTEIN Other than Jason Marquis, there's no big-name recognition. IKE DAVIS Holy fuck, huh? It's actually kind of a relief that we don't have superstars on the team. You need someone that's going to deal with the situation being a little off. JONATHAN MAYO How's the shoulder feeling? SAM FULD We'll know in about an hour, two hours. ILAN GALPER We're from Ra'anana, Israel. DAVID GALPER He loves baseball. I love baseball. He is the... he wants to go with me on the trip, so I figured it's once in a lifetime. MARGO SUGARMAN What happens in baseball is that you take your hat off when there's an anthem. ANNOUNCER First, the anthem of Israel. MARGO SUGARMAN To see these guys take their hat off and reveal a kippah underneath is just something that every Jewish person in the world loves. Prime Minister Netanyahu who took that clip and put it in his Twitter posting. Watching Team Israel play Team Korea, it was insane. Thousands and thousands of Korean fans, who are exceptionally noisy. MARGO SUGARMAN You've got these guys on the field... CODY DECKER They ain't ready. MARGO SUGARMAN I am thinking, "Oh my God, are they going to be okay?" PAUL SEVERINO Jason Marquis set to deliver his first pitch. MARGO SUGARMAN "Is this not going to bother them? Oy vey." TY KELLY They have a different song for every player that comes up to bat, banging drums and dancing and singing. RYAN LAVARNWAY It really helped that we don't speak the language. It was almost like background noise or static. It almost helped me focus even more. PAUL SEVERINO A chance to get Team Israel on the board here in the top of the second inning. And that is how the first run is scored, on a bases-loaded walk, one-nothing Israel. JON MOSCOT Oh shucks! Wow! Glendale, AZ, 3:30 AM, JON MOSCOT Yeah, seriously. You got cheerleaders? Oh my goodness! To try and explain baseball to people in Israel, it's... it's... you know, it's like very foreign to them and it's weird thinking that the sport is foreign somewhere. MARK SHELDON Yeah. Do you think anybody in Israel is watching? JON MOSCOT If you went to a restaurant, I don't think it would be on the TV. I hope one day it will be. I wish I was there. MARK SHELDON It's 7:30 PM in Korea. JON MOSCOT Korea, that's some dedication right here. We're... we're locked into Team Israel baseball right now. Gotta get a W, they gotta give us a W. That's what... that's what, this is our part, we're doing our part over here, so we... we need them to do their part over there. PAUL SEVERINO Israel with a one-run lead and go! This one is driven to right centerfield. Fuld is back and he makes the catch! SAM FULD The turf here in Korea is incredibly hard. It's like concrete. Came up and my skin was gone. JOE MAGRANE There's just not a ball in the air that Sam Fuld can't catch. SAM FULD At the risk of being too gory, I... I can show everyone my hand here. PAUL SEVERINO Bottom of the fifth with Team Israel up one-nothing, third pitcher of the night for Team Israel will be Jeremy Bleich. Two on and nobody out, easily the best scoring chance so far for Korea. JEREMY BLEICH I knew I was gonna be in a fireman's role, like come in and put this out. JOE MAGRANE Good pitch! PAUL SEVERINO That one is strike three. JEREMY BLEICH I struck the first guy out on a three-two fastball. PAUL SEVERINO Second baseman slaps this one through the left side for a base hit. He gets the green light coming around third. Play at the plate, not in time. JEREMY BLEICH And then a run scored. You drop a couple choice words to yourself and then you move on. If you let the last pitch bother you, then the next pitch is not gonna go very well either. PAUL SEVERINO Tae Kyun Kim pops this one up. Will Lavarnway have room? Yes. JEREMY BLEICH I was able to get the next two hitters to pop out. PAUL SEVERINO Nicely done by Bleich, but Korea ties things up. Bases loaded, top of the eighth. And he strikes out Burcham. For the third time tonight, Israel leaves the bases loaded. It's getting late here in Seoul. TY KELLY We left a ton of guys on base. PAUL SEVERINO We're tied at one and a new pitcher for Team Israel as Josh Zeid takes over. TY KELLY It was the most stressful game that I've ever played in my life. MARGO SUGARMAN The score just didn't budge for way too many innings. It's like a husband watching his wife going through labor. You're like, "Oh my God. When's this going to end?" PAUL SEVERINO Bottom of the ninth inning, runner goes. Lavarnway's throw right on the money. Got him. And we're going to extra innings. JERRY WEINSTEIN Oh, these labor pains are killing me. All of a sudden, the baby popped out. PAUL SEVERINO Grounded, can he make the play? No throw and Israel has a 2-1 lead on the infield single by Scott Burcham. And it's going to be Josh Zeid out for his third inning of work. JOSH ZEID I got my very first Jewish star when I was eight years old. I'll be throwing a pitch, and it'll just come up and hit me in the face and that ma... that reminds me that God's there. PAUL SEVERINO Zeid's gotta get one more out, strike one. JOSH ZEID Teams will say, "You can't wear necklaces." PAUL SEVERINO 0 and two, Team Korea down to their last strike. JOSH ZEID I wear it, regardless. PAUL SEVERINO Dae-ho Lee strikes out and Team Israel wins it, 2-1 in ten innings. And how about that? Tomorrow Israel against Chinese Taipei at noon local time. SCOTT BURCHAM That was one of the most stressful games I've ever played. JOSH ZEID I don't even... I... I honestly didn't see the last pitch. I threw it and I didn't see what happened. There's people texting me right now. I don't know where it ends. JONATHAN MAYO After an emotional game like this, how do you hit the Reset button so quickly? JOSH ZEID This has to be it. I mean, this has to be at the top win in my career, but tomorrow's a brand-new day. JONATHAN MAYO You guys aren't unknown anymore. PETER KURZ New York Times, feels great. RYAN LAVARNWAY My name is Ryan Lavarnway. We've all been through media training with our teams. REPORTER Is... is that something have you ever... oh yeah, get ready for the bite. Don't look over your shoulder, but anyway... RYAN LAVARNWAY But this is a little different. It feels good, um... JOOHEE CHO I am here with Ryan Lavarnway. He's the catcher. New York Times called it, "The Miracle of the Miracles", how do you respond to that? RYAN LAVARNWAY Uh, I think that, that we've believed in ourselves. Media said that, "This was the miracle of all miracles." I said, "To who?" PAUL SEVERINO Sam Fuld sends this one through the hole on the right side. RYAN LAVARNWAY I don't know why we were such underdogs. PAUL SEVERINO Ty Kelly scorches one to right field. RYAN LAVARNWAY We weren't underdogs in our head. PAUL SEVERINO And Davis will drive in a run with a base hit. RYAN LAVARNWAY We have good players on our team. PAUL SEVERINO This is sent high and deep toward left centerfield and it has gone! A two-run homer for Ryan Lavarnway makes it six-nothing. PAUL SEVERINO And Team Israel has beaten Korean and Chinese Taipei to improve to 2-0. JOOHEE CHO One thing I really wanted to ask about was the mascot sitting right there. NATE FISH Sure, the Mensch on the Bench? JOOHEE CHO The Mensch on the Bench. NATE FISH Mensch just means "good guy." -JOOHEE CHO Good guy. -NATE FISH That's it. -JOOHEE CHO In Yiddish. -NATE FISH Yeah, in Yiddish. Yes, in Yiddish. Um, I gotta give credit to Cody Decker for this. CODY DECKER I saw it on Shark Tank. NEAL HOFFMAN Introducing the Mensch on a Bench, is the new Jewish family tradition. CODY DECKER There's the Elf on the Shelf. So this company made a thing called the Mensch on the Bench. NEAL HOFFMAN A mensch is a do-gooder. CODY DECKER I said, "I'm gonna get a Mensch on the Bench and it'll be like our Jobu." In the movie 'Major League', Jobu was a small idol. Pedro Cerrano would pour him rum, making all these offerings to get wins. So, that's what we did. We gave him a new tallis, friends. I brought him to the postgame interviews. I wanted it to be like this Andy Kaufman thing. It's there but I don't know what you're talking about. REPORTER Can you please explain, Cody, what this mensch to your right is? CODY DECKER That's Jerry Weinstein, my manager. Oh, oh this. He's a... he's a mascot, he's a friend, he's a teammate, he's a borderline deity. MARGO SUGARMAN The Mensch on the Bench is probably getting two-to-one media requests over any of the players. REPORTER For people who don't know about him, can just explain more about uh, mensch and where, where he come from? CODY DECKER Well, he... he comes from a lot of places really, but you know, there's a company called the Mensch on the Bench, they sell mensches. REPORTER And, I guess your entire family's coming with you. CODY DECKER Yes, yes, so. I think the biggest Jew in my family... REPORTER Now where were you watching the game? CODY DECKER ...was my grandfather, Seymour. He almost looked like Robert De Niro in 'Casino'. Big glasses, came off mobster-like. I always thought he hated me. I wore the white jersey today for the first time, blue sleeves with Israel across the chest. It looks like an Israeli flag. All I keep thinking to myself is, how proud my grandfather would be to see this. It means a lot to a lot of people. More than I thought it would. PAUL SEVERINO For Team Israel, it's a chance for the underdog to get a crack at the big dog. JOE MAGRANE Boy, Israel is now kind of the upset-makers. It has been something out of a movie. PAUL SEVERINO It certainly has been. JOSH ZEID There's a nation of people striving for Israel to be seen in a positive light. We've chosen to be their spokesman on this baseball front. It's already beautiful and it's already perfect. SAM FULD I'm Sam Fuld. Just about a year ago, my shoulder injury happened. ANNOUNCER He's got it and Fuld's throw is there. Got him. Sam Fuld with a terrific throw. SAM FULD Did it on one throw from the outfield and right away knew it was something pretty serious. Giving that I'm getting up there in age, it just... it was pretty crushing. It felt like, "Oh, man. This might be the... the end." I made it a goal of mine: I was gonna come back and play for Team Israel. JERRY WEINSTEIN I'm also worried about Sammy Fuld, you know, leaving him out there. I need to have those middle infielders have a feel for just how bad his arm is. What concerns me with Sam is when he has to make a do-or-die play and make a quick, you know, momentum going forward, arm going back, and now. ASSISTANT COACH He's conscious about diving. We spoke about it. JERRY WEINSTEIN Yeah. SAM FULD I want to prove to others that you can be Jewish and be an athlete. PAUL SEVERINO The Netherlands in the first. JOE MAGRANE What ball cannot Sam Fuld catch? Sam Fuld has difficulty throwing. That ball bounces. He's only throwing it about 60 feet. It's like launching a grenade. PAUL SEVERINO Freiman chases him down and tags him out for out number three. SAM FULD Regardless of how this turns out, we're at least showing we can put together a roster of 28 Jewish ball players who are pretty darn good. PAUL SEVERINO The tying run in the top of the eighth in a 4-1 game, Schoop at second, Bogaerts at first. JOE MAGRANE Bringing in the strong arm Zeid. RYAN LAVARNWAY The pitcher's mound can feel like the loneliest place in the world. If I can read their body language, see their movements start to seem a little unconfident, I can remind them that they're not alone. Josh is awesome. We really hit it off on the trip to Israel. I could tell he was moving a little different. PAUL SEVERINO And the pitch, to second, Krieger, high throw, no out at second, and a run comes in to score. And now it's 4-2. RYAN LAVARNWAY I said, "Hey man, what's going on?" And he doesn't have a contract for this baseball season yet. He wasn't as confident as he could've been. It really helped that we had been spending so much time together. PAUL SEVERINO The top of the ninth inning. Team Israel is one out away from going undefeated. Swing and a miss. Israel sweeps through Seoul. In their first WBC, they finished pool A a perfect 3 and 0. JOE MAGRANE They're flying to Tokyo. And oh how far you've come. MARGO SUGARMAN The world's gone nuts. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER They won all their games. They're undefeated. They are amazing everyone. Not since Sandy Koufax, and you thought all our people could do was finance. CHRIS HARDWICK The stars of the tournament thus far have been underdogs Team Israel. They've scored some huge upsets against both Team South Korea and Team Egypt, and... KOSHA DILLZ So where you goin'? MARK DANON Their mascot's the Mensch on the Bench. They're going with the Jew Crew thing. JONAH KERI It's been a very successful team and maybe the big story in the WBC so far. YAEL LAVIE Making their way to the top, the team seemingly came out of nowhere. KOSHA DILLZ âª Next up to bat if you believe in dreams âª âª 69 years Israel we that team âª âª And we swinging for the fences âª âª from the bench with the mensches âª âª celebrating independence âª âª Bunch of rejects and they looking for respect âª âª Mensch on the Bench screaming at me like "We next" âª âª First up to bat, swinging over your soul now âª âª Swing batter, batter we approaching a gold now âª âª Couldn't catch a cold in the MLB âª âª I'm floating with Jerry Weinstein on the Dead Sea âª MARGO SUGARMAN I coordinate all the media requests. KOSHA DILLZ âª Israeli ballgame better than a birthright trip âª MARGO SUGARMAN Before we left and you're speaking to journalists and you say, "Oh, you know, we've got Team Israel. We're going to The World Baseball Classic. You know, do you want to come?" "Eh, I don't know. We'll see, maybe, maybe." KOSHA DILLZ âª We the Bad News Bears, with a better past âª âª Jamaican bobsled team, the Jewish half âª MARGO SUGARMAN Now it's like someone turned the switch. KOSHA DILLZ âª Next up to bat if you believe in dreams âª âª 69 years Israel, we that team âª âª And we swinging for the fences âª âª from the bench with the mensches âª âª celebrating independence âª âª Next up to bat if you believe in dreams âª âª 69 years Israel, we that team âª âª And we swinging for the fences âª âª from the bench with the mensches âª âª celebrating independence âª âª Fast ball, Mossad curve ball âª âª you don't see it coming, amazing defense... âª TY KELLY We have gotten attention from the rest of the world and that's a really weird thing because it feels like the same game that we've played our whole lives. My name is Ty Kelly. I was with the Orioles, traded to the Mariners, traded to the Cardinals, picked up by the Blue Jays, signed with the Mets. CODY DECKER This team is an Island of Misfit Toys. All spent years with the big leagues but have felt at times underappreciated in this game. RYAN LAVARNWAY The call-ups, the send-downs, when you've achieved your dream and you're at the top of the mountain and then the next minute you're not good enough. TY KELLY We have been kicked around throughout our careers. We know what it's like to be doubted. We're not gonna be intimidated. BLAKE GAILEN Everybody shut the fuck up. It's not over. Okay, now it's over. RYAN LAVARNWAY We just shocked the world and won Pool A in Seoul. Tomorrow we play against Cuba in the second round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic. We're going to move on to yet another arena and play with a whole other level of teams. JEREMY BLEICH All of a sudden you have kids from all over the world following us. I know back home, the USY group has an event to watch our game against Cuba, an overnight event. All of a sudden, now we're playing for something. ERIC BLUM A year ago, my dad passed, one year ago. ERIC BLUM I can't go to synagogue but I'd like to say in name in front of you guys if that's OK. I know he's watching. I can't think of a better place. PETER KURZ Say Kaddish. Say Kaddish. Say Kaddish. MANAGERS Oseh shalom bimromav. Hu ya'aseh shalom aleynu. Ve'alkolyisrael. Ve'imru amen. YONI ROSENBLATT Happier times. PAUL SEVERINO Top of the ninth inning. RICH WALTZ They arrive here to take on international power Cuba and Israel, three outs away from another win. Gracial strikes out. And he got him. And Zeid has struck out two here in the ninth. Ground ball short, this should do it, Burcham to first. Israel, again. Can you believe it? This magic carpet ride continues for Israel. CUBAN REPORTER Israel has not properly recruited a team of its country, but in fact experts are calling it United States 2 or United States 3. What is your opinion on a team that should represent Israel but actually represents the United States? JERRY WEINSTEIN Well, I don't agree with that. All our guys qualify under the heritage rules. The attitude in our clubhouse is we're not the JV team for Team USA. We're... we're representing Israel and make no mistake about that. It's a face saver. "Well, we really didn't lose to Israel. We lost to just another USA team." That's BS. You lost to Israel, brother. RICH WALTZ These two teams did meet in Korea although that game was probably not one you can really measure the two teams by. LAURIE TAMRES It makes me very proud because now Israel's got a team and it's just so great to have Star of Davids on people's heads and... and out in the world and people buying the hats because they want to have the same hats. It's great. It's awesome. AVIMADERER And the Mensch on the Bench. RICH WALTZ Kelly has really been a sparkplug and the top of this order for Israel has been terrific. One inning in, scoreless. MAN 2 People from all over the world are not accustomed to thinking of Israel as a leader in sports. And this team puts Israel on the map. RICH WALTZ And the Netherlands is up four-nothing. Gregorius rips it, left centerfield, Balentien rolling around third, on his way home. And it's a triple for Gregorius. MAN 3 Could be better, we're down ten to nada. MAN 2 Ten to nothing. BOY 1 Rally caps, people, rally caps. RICH WALTZ That ball is crushed and gone. And that's the power that Nate Freiman has. MAN 2 Somebody just hit a homerun. MAN 4 Homerun! MAN 2 Who hit it? BOY 2 It's amazing that we have such a good team. And it really shows that maybe like us kids now in a few years, we can be on that team and hopefully get to the majors, which I want to do, you guys probably also. BOY 1 My favorite player on the team is the catcher 'cause I understand what he's going through. It's not easy to be a catcher, believe me. MAN 2 I like Sam Fuld. He hustles. He's got a lot of heart. WOMAN 2 I'd have to say Ty Kelly. I'm from New York and being raised with the Mets, he's amazing. RICH WALTZ That's strike three. That's the ball game. The Netherlands evens the score. JOSH HALICKMAN It's finished for tonight, but we still get Japan on Wednesday, so miracles do happen, and we're still in it. That's for sure. MARGO SUGARMAN I'm unofficially a team mom. For some of them, it's just nice to have an older female presence around. They know that you'll have their back. Going in here to find a quiet spot. We're going to face Japan and it's going to be tough. You know, so what? David faced Goliath. You saw what happened to David. He had a really good pitching arm and it was good for him. No matter what happens, Israel has done something that no one in the whole world expected them to do. They're going to be in the top eight teams in the world in baseball. That's a good place to be for a 200-1 non-favorite. RYAN LAVARNWAY Hello! REPORTER Hi! How are you guys? RYAN LAVARNWAY Good, how are you? REPORTER I'm from the main newscaster in Israel. We want to do a report about your success at the World Classic. -JOSH ZEID Sounds good, yeah. -RYAN LAVARNWAY All right, let's do it. We don't want to have American Jews forever playing for Israel. We... we love playing for Israel and representing the people, but the goal is to... to have homegrown kids playing for the team in the years to come. -CODY DECKER You did an awesome job. -BLAKE GAILEN Thanks man! CODY DECKER Fuckin' crushed it. Sweetie, someone's... someone's marrying Logan. JENN STERGER I wish. CODY DECKER Why'd I do this? 'Cause everyone knows if there's one thing the Japanese fear, it's the wolverine. RYAN LAVARNWAY Not everybody on this team believes in Judaism. Not everyone on this team was raised Jewish. There's a couple players that are married to Jewish women or that had a Jewish grandparent. But that didn't matter two generations ago when the Nazis were grabbing you up based on the way that you were born or based on affiliation. RICH WALTZ Here's the first pitch. He lines one into right field for a base hit. RYAN LAVARNWAY Now the Star of David is there and that just means that we belong. RICH WALTZ Lavarnway to left field, down the line it goes. Kelly will score. Davis will score. RYAN LAVARNWAY We have the right to exist. RICH WALTZ The Mensch on the Bench is not done. RYAN LAVARNWAY And you can't deny the Jewish people the way that people in the course of history have tried to. RICH WALTZ And it's over. Japan is headed to Los Angeles. One of the great stories of this Classic are these guys. Look at the emotion, obviously, disappointed to lose, but I think everybody understands what they've accomplished. CODY DECKER I can't wait for you guys to have a stadium, a field, a complex here that is befitting of this beautiful country. Thank you so much for inviting us here with open arms. MOSHE ABUTBUL We are planting a small ball from which a big and beautiful field will grow. JEREMY BLEICH Someone on the way home said, "You realize we could be like the Koufax of the next three generations?" IKE DAVIS I can't wait until this thing's built. JEREMY BLEICH Maybe that's stretched, but maybe it's not. Whether that's in the game of baseball more importantly in the game of life, you're giving a kid hope to step out of his comfort zone and say, "Hey, you remember when Israel made that run in the World Baseball Classic?"
