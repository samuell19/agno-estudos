(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) You want to have yourself a beer or something while you're waiting there? BARTENDER: You hear me, mister? I'll take the bottle. BARTENDER: Howdy, boys. What can I do for you? Brewskis. Brewskis. You got it. There you go. (CHUCKLING) Hey. Fifty now, 50 more when you're done. How many? Just one. What is he, another cop? No. Matter of fact, he's a friend of yours. You're going to like this job. He was in my brother's gang. First, he dropped a dime on him, then he ratted him to the cop that blew him away. Hey. I'm gonna go on in and take a look. Want a Coke? Yeah, Diet. We're on the Simmons Road about 15 miles west off of Route 14. I need wants and warrants on motorcycle registrations. FEMALE DISPATCHER: Roger. I copy. First one, California. 6-David-8-4-Sam-Niner. Roger. Copy that. Second plate... Tom. How you doing? Nice to see you. Willie Hickok. Right here. Cherry Ganz, Officer. Do I know you guys? Repeat, code 6-Charles. (GRUNTING) Who you calling, friend? Nobody. I wasn't calling nobody. (COCKS GUN) Somehow I don't believe you. Oh, God! Oh, no! (ANNOUNCER CHATTERING OVER PA) $100,000. $50,000 now. Ice Man's a generous guy. I don't like hundreds. I told you that before. What kind of shit is this? Well, this is the guy. The balance is due when he's dusted. You understand what I'm talking about? We want him dead. Yeah, whatever. No problem. Police! Freeze! You, move a step apart. Now, I don't want anybody to get hurt here, so move slow. (SCREAMING) MOTORCYCLE DRIVER: Watch it! Shit! Get back! Get the hell out of here! (SIRENS APPROACHING) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTERING) Christ, you really toasted that guy. God damn it, I didn't toast the guy. I just shot him, for Christ sake. Don't say I toasted him, Ben. Calm down. We'll find the gun. We've just got to do this together. Get our stories straight. Checked the guy's locker. Seems okay. He works here at the track. Fifty bucks in his wallet, a pair of sunglasses, some keys, probably car or apartment. We still haven't found his gun, yet. Shit. Cates took down one of the locals. A slug hit one of the gas pumps and burned the bad guy to a crisp. Now, Jack claims it was a righteous shooting. OFFICER: All right, man. It's all right. Man, I hate these IAD scumbags. Blake Wilson, Internal Affairs. Seems like I'm always running into you, Jack. Give us a minute, fellas. What did you do now, Jack? I was on a stakeout. I was getting real close to nailing these... Close? Oh, the Ice Man, right? Yeah, God damn it. The Ice Man. I tell you, I'm getting real close. I'm gonna nail these guys. For years you've been trying to pin every case you can't solve on the Ice Man. He's the biggest drug dealer in the Bay Area, right, Jack? Except we don't have any prints, we don't have a description. You're the only cop on the force who believes this guy exists. I'll let you in on a little secret. There is no Ice Man. So let's get back to the cold facts of this because this is real. Now, what the hell happened here? I saw an exchange. Probable cause. I moved in. He had a piece. He shot. I shot back. You got the bad guy's gun? It's got to be in there with the ashes and shit. I didn't touch anything. Cruise, what do you got? Nothing much. Just some burnt metal. Must be off the pump. No gun? No, no gun. Look, a cop is a guy, and a guy sometimes steps on his dick. You think maybe today you were pushing a little too hard, trying to make something work, and you stepped on your dick? Work with me here. We're on the same side. Did you step on your... Now, wait a minute. God damn it, it didn't go down that way. He had a piece. He shot. I shot back. Kehoe, I want the lab boys to go over every inch of this place. If there's a gun here, I want it. A bullet. Something. Anything. See you around, Jack. Yeah. Reggie Hammond. You must be a real dangerous convict. You made me miss, cop. You look good, Reggie. I ain't seen you in years, man. I thought you was my friend. Well, I'm sorry. I've been busy. Yeah, me, too. You must be pretty desperate to come down here, man. You even got a new haircut. What's going on? Well, times change. Well, you lost a couple of pounds. Quit drinking. So, what, the warden pick you to come in here and tell me my sentence got yanked up another five years or something? Oh, relax. You're still getting out tomorrow. But when you do, you and me's got another little job to do. Man, you and me don't have shit to do. When I get out of here, just give me my fucking money and walk away from me, all right? 'Cause I played that cop shit once and it don't work. Have my money when I get out, please. Now, wait a minute, Reggie. You don't get it. You see, if you don't help me out on this one, I'm not ever gonna give you your money back. You're fucking with me, right? No. Hey, Jack, I gave you that money in good faith. 'Cause you told me I could fucking trust you. Now, you're gonna tell me after all this shit, I can't have my money? Yeah, now you got the picture, convict. (LAUGHING) You screwed up real good this time, Hammond. It was self-defense. Nobody's gonna buy that crap! Hey, wait a minute, man! I served two years for a crime I did and I never fucking denied that. But I've just spent five years in here for some shit that was bullshit! I never robbed no damn payroll. You people got murderers in here been here less time than me. You can spend your remaining time in isolation. Open up.

Come on, Cherry. (UNCOCKS GUN) In the matter of the officer-involved shooting at Hunters Point raceway of the suspect Arthur Brock, a resident of San Francisco, the review board has carefully examined the physical evidence and the testimony of the witnesses, and has determined that the officer in question, Inspector Jack Cates, had insufficient probable cause. Based on a review of the officer's case history and an ongoing investigation by the Internal Affairs Division, this review board cannot help but rule that the shooting was a wrongful action. I never thought they'd land on you so hard. I swear... I'm gonna have to recommend to the District Attorney that he prosecute you for manslaughter. Sure as hell wish they'd found that gun. Well, I'm sorry, Jack. I'm just doing my job. (SARCASTICALLY) Right. Wilson's got a personality profile of an obsessed cop, whose record shows his history of stepping over the line, okay? It's quite likely the DA will choose to prosecute you on third degree. In other words, you're screwed. Unless I find the Ice Man. Oh, come on, Jack. Give it up. That's what got you into this. Jesus Christ, Ben. You sound like Wilson. We're talking about the facts here. You got no leads. The department's got no leads. This is manslaughter. Protect yourself. (BELL RINGS) (CELLBLOCK DOOR SLAMMING) Hammond, let's go. Big day for you today. Just get me the hell out of here, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. KIRKLAND: Reggie. Come here. Excuse me a minute. You will keep your promise, right? Everything is... Don't worry, everything is cool. It's no problem. That white cop that came to see you yesterday? Now, he ain't no problem, is he? Oh, no. No, no, no. He ain't gonna fuck that up. I promise you everything is cool, but it might take a little bit longer than I said it was gonna take. Don't bullshit me, man. You get that money and you keep your word. I kept you alive in this funky rat hole for five years, so don't act like everything is everything. I can get you out there, Reggie. I can reach out of here and pull your fucking heart out! What was all that going on back there? Just talking about an old football bet. That's a crock. Hammond, Reggie A. WARDEN: I came by to give you $100 in cash and a free bus ride to San Francisco, all compliments of the State of California. And that's it? That is it. Thank you for sparing me the other crap. Hey, man, you ain't got to slam my shit down like that. Yo, where's my James Brown tape? The shit ain't in... Oh. Everybody trying to keep me and James in prison. Hey, we didn't get to finish our conversation. Hey, man, stay the fuck away from me till you get my money, all right? I told you yesterday, convict, you're not getting your money unless you help me. Look, man, I trusted you with my money and my car, and you fucked me. I thought you were straight. What the fuck's going on, man? I've been chasing a drug dealer called the Ice Man for the last four years. Now, last week, I find out this Ice Man wants you dead. Here, take a look at this. I got this off of some guy paying someone to make a hit on you. You recognize this guy? Huh? Now, in four years, Reggie, that makes you the best lead I ever had. Yeah? Well, helping you out while you got my money is something I don't want to do! REGGIE: Let me rot in a fucking prison for five years and you show up wanting some help. That's bullshit. That's worse than bullshit. That's dumb, man! Reggie, this time, I promise you it's gonna be different. Now, look, I'm gonna lose my badge. They're gonna put me in jail. Oh, you're in trouble with the law this time? Good! Good! As bad as I feel about you keeping my money, that shit almost makes me feel better. Now I'm sure I don't want to go with you! Now, wait a minute, God damn it. I don't beg! What you gonna do, whip my ass? You gonna shoot me out here in front of the prison? That's not a very good way to treat the best lead you ever had. Don't worry. I'll come visit you in about five or six years. Hey, man, let's get the hell out of here. Hey, we got a schedule. Hey, fuck that, man. I'm a free man now.

(GLASS TINKLING) (GASPS) (SIRENS APPROACHING) Come on! (GUNSHOTS) Come on! DOCTOR: You got a hairline fracture of your left clavicle. JACK: Right. Blunt trauma broke the skin. Right. You're lucky. You always wear a bulletproof vest? Only when I see my friends. Look, I want you to change the bandage on your chest every hour, hour and a half. All right. And I have to immobilize this arm, so wear this sling. All right. Thanks, Doc. Wait. Where are you going? I still have to wait for your lab reports. I've got police business. REGGIE: Hey, man, look, I said I was minding my own business, and then those bikers came along and started shooting at the bus. X-rays are fine, Mr. Hammond. Yeah, well, how come my head is still hurting? Hey, look, buddy, you had a bus roll over on you. Nobody said it wasn't gonna hurt. Look, you might have a slight concussion or a subdural hematoma. Either way, you're one lucky man. Now, we're gonna hold you overnight. We'll know more in the morning. No, y'all ain't holding me overnight no place. Me and my subdural hematoma are going home. I ain't spending my first free day out in no fucking hospital. Now, you're gonna be here till you answer all our questions. Are you sure you never saw those bikers before? Look, man, all you rednecks look the same to me, all right? Keep on him, Art. I'll be right back. Oh, great. I gotta spend my first day out with Art, the goddamn redneck. Coming out of the kitchen, with my arm's full of this guy's breakfast, you know. And I'm worried 'cause I don't want to be late, you know, 'cause he looks funny. Not like just he's hungry, but like he's mad at something. And then, the next thing I know, there's these big gunshots, and the window's breaking, and... Reggie Hammond. When can I see him? Hey, look, if it was up to me, I'd help you out. They're gonna keep him overnight. You know, observation. Hey, that's one lucky guy, you know. I'd like to follow him around the racetrack. You know what I mean? You know what that guy was in the joint for? No. That son of a bitch is a child molester. He's involved in kiddie porn. Now, I got to get him back to San Francisco by tonight, so that he can identify the kingpin of the organization. If I don't get him back there by tonight, the goddamn kingpin walks. Hey, Reggie. You want to go for a ride in a Cadillac? Oh, Jesus Christ. Look, man, I've been having a fucked-up day, and the last thing I wanted to see was you. Come on, Reggie, I'm just trying to help you out. Of course, you could always catch a bus. You had a lot of luck on the last one. Look, just do me a favor, Jack, and just disappear. Stay away from me, all right? I'm sorry, Reg. They released you in my custody. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) (WOMAN CHATTERING OVER PA) All right, let's get down to business. You ever seen those bikers before? Jack, my memory gets a lot better when I got money in my pocket. You know the rules, Reggie. Soon as you tell me why the Ice Man wants you dead, I'll think about giving your money back. Hey, why don't you ask that guy who you got my picture off of? He's not talking real good anymore. I killed him. Very smooth, Jack. What, they paying you by the pound now? Well, he shot at me first, only we can't find his gun. That's why I'm in the shitter. Hey, Jack, if you're looking for sympathy, you've come to the wrong person, okay? I'm supposed to be on my way to Florida to be in my uncle's used-car business. Instead, I'm here with you, I'm broke, I've been shot at, I was in a bus that flipped over 20 times, I had glass all in my hair and all over my suit, broke my Walkman, and lost my James Brown tape, and plus, I've been hit by a big fucking truck. So leave me alone, okay, Jack? Well, life's tough, Reggie. I ran into your friends, too, today. They shot me in the chest six times. You don't look bad for a dead person. I would be if it wasn't for one of these. Yeah, why do you wear this, anyway? Well, I knew I was gonna see you, Reg. Now, I wouldn't want to get killed by a stray bullet that was meant for you. Now, that'd be a hell of a way to go, wouldn't it be? That's very sensitive, Jack. You think maybe I should get one of these? Well, you can get these anyplace. You can get 'em at sporting goods. They run about 750 bucks. A little more than they gave you when they let you out, right, Reg? Jack, I hope you at least still got my Porsche. Oh, yeah. It's safe and sound back in the city. I took real good care of it like I said I would. Hey, man, look, just 'cause you said you gonna do something, don't mean you gonna. You said we had a deal and you fucked me. I fucked you? You fucked yourself. You stole the payroll out at the prison. They found the money in your cell. I checked into it. Motherfucker, I got framed. Oh, yeah, yeah. Some convict got a guard to open up the cell, put the money underneath the pillow like the tooth fairy. Yeah, you got framed. That's what every convict says. Hey, what about you, man? You know they never found that bad guy's gun out at the racetrack. That's different. What's different about that? I'm a cop. You're a crook. Get the fuck out of here! Just because I'm a convict, everything that comes out of my mouth is a goddamn lie? That's right. So just screw Reggie Hammond? That's right. Man, just take me to my goddamn car. I'm through with you. What's wrong? Your arm hurt? Yeah. Thanks to your friends. Hurt bad? Yeah. Good. You hear the news? Yeah, well, we got a problem here, slick. Hey, man, back up. I'm not the one that hired these hillbillies, so don't come complaining to me, okay? Yes. Plan B. We got an ex-Marine on the case. Only problem is he's a hillbilly, too. Yeah. Right. Later. How much of my money did you spend, anyway? Oh, about 25 grand. You said I could buy a new car. Well, where is it? This is the new car. This look like the same piece-of-shit, sky-blue Cadillac you had before. Yeah, I bought the same model, year, color, everything the same. That's the way I like it. I get attached to things, Reggie. You got the same car. Same clothes. Yeah. You got the same girl, too? Elaine? Hell, I don't want to talk about this shit. Well, this is good. Keep it all balled up like a nut. JACK: She married me about five years ago. Drove me over to city hall for a quick ceremony. She figured she'd settle me down. This is where we lived until we split up. She moved up to Mill Valley. I've been trying to sell it. Twelve grand of yours went for the down payment. Man, how could you leave my car outside all these years? Why didn't you put it in the fucking garage? Look at that dirt all over it. What if somebody stole it? Yeah, I had an alarm put on it. Here, you just push this blue button right there. You have no appreciation whatsoever for what's hype. That's what it is. You don't know that that car is fly. You know how much pussy I got because of that car? (ALARM CHIRPS) (HUBCAP CLATTERING) They blew up my car! They blew up my car! They blew up my car! It's a damn shame. They blew up my goddamn car, and all you got to say is, "It's a damn shame"? No car. No money. You're having a bad day. That's it. I'm through with you, man! I'm calling some of my fucking homies. I'm getting a loan and I'm stepping the fuck off! (METAL CLATTERING) (TRAM BELL RINGING) Buster! Hey, what's up, man? How you doing? Reggie Hammond. Yes, my brother! Yeah, I'm out, my man. I'm on the street again. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Just--Just cool it, brother. Yo, listen. No, no, no, listen. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna do that. I know. I'm gonna take care... That's what I'm calling about. I need a loan. Uh-huh. Yeah, I know I owe you some shit, but I need a loan. Now, I just got out of jail. Brother, my brother, everything's gonna be... Yes, listen. No, I don't have no collateral. I just got out of jail, man. The fuck I need collateral for? This is Reggie Hammond. Hey. Hey. Hey, Buster? Buster? (PHONES RINGING) KEHOE: Jack. JACK: Yeah? What the hell's going on? We got a report you were shot and your house blew up. No, not my house. A car. Well, the fire department's still out there. Your car blew up? No, no, it wasn't my car. It was some other guy's car parked in front. Listen, anything come in on those bikers that hit the prison bus? No, not yet. I'll check again. All right. Look, Jack, do me a favor and go see Wilson. He told me if you won't see him right away, he's gonna send somebody out to get you. Shit. Hey, Jack. You okay? (SIREN WAILING) (DISPATCHER CHATTERING OVER POLICE RADIO) Hey, you giving that guy a ticket? Good. He hates cops. He does, huh? Yeah, I rode down here with him. He told me that cops ain't shit and that y'all was just pussies that hide behind your badges. And he also said that he gonna park this car, he don't care if it's a no-parking zone, and if I see a cop, tell the cop to kiss his ass. So kiss his ass. Your friend's not too smart. Yeah, I know. He's a big dumb-ass cop named Jack Cates. Shit. Tell Cates to stop parking in front of the station. (PHONE RINGING) WILSON: Hello, Jack. First, the motorcycle track and then the diner, and now we found a bomb at your house? And I'll bet the Ice Man's responsible for it all, right? I'm not gonna stand here and argue with you. Man to man, I'm here to support you. However, as Supervisor of Internal Affairs, it's my job to tell you that you're still on suspension, at least until the court hearing tomorrow. So, why don't you give me that gun and your badge and police ID? Yeah. Right. I'll bet you think I enjoy this, don't you? Jack, do me a favor. Go home and get some sleep. I got to go down and check on a few things. Make out some reports. You know, I don't mind people checking up on cops. I don't think we're above the law. But making cops do it, it's bad for morale. It's bad for cops. Civilians ought to do it. You're a real chickenshit, Wilson. But maybe it's not your fault. Maybe it's your job. (COMPUTER BEEPS) All right. (BEEPING) Yo, Marvin! Hey, what's up, man? Reggie Hammond. Hammond. Reggie Hammond. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How you doing, man? I just got out. Yeah, my brother, yeah. Listen... What? You a born-again Christian? Get the fuck out of here. No, man, it's just... No, I just can't picture you, you know, being no-born again... I was there when you beat the bitch up, now. No, no, don't get me wrong. I know you can find Jesus. Everybody can find Jesus. No, I love Jesus. I love Jesus. I love Jesus. I love... Hello? Hello? Hello? Marvin? Hey, Willie Biggs! Reggie Hammond. Hello? Hello? Black motherfucker. MAN: Here you go, Jack. Thirteen complaints involving biker-types in the last four days. Two traffics and a D&D up in North Beach. Run these guys through the NCIC. I'll have Cruise do it. Don't look much like a biker to me. Nice talking to you. You still here? I didn't think you'd stick around. If you think I'm happy about being here, you can guess again, all right? I'm supposed to be a free man with money in my pocket and getting along with my life, and the last thing I wanted to do was get tied to your big, dumb, white ass again. (CHUCKLING) Welcome back, Reg. Get the fuck off me, man. I ain't no fucking convict no more. I'm a free man. And you? You about a inch away from where I was yesterday. So you ain't running jack shit, okay? Let me tell you something. I ain't working for you, I don't like you, and I don't trust you. All right, now just cut the bullshit. Just give me something I can use, Reggie. The Ice Man? The Ice Man bought your house. Now, God damn it, I said cut the bullshit. I can't believe you didn't put this shit together yet, man. Me and Ganz robbed somebody for half a million dollars a couple years back. That was the Ice Man, and he's still pissed off about the shit. Yeah, it's amazing how money affects some people, ain't it, Jack? I see your wheels turning. Yes. Yes. The man that you've been looking for all this time bought your fucked-up car and put a down payment on your house for you. And you've been riding around in the car that he bought for you, looking for him, which makes you probably the dumbest motherfucker in law enforcement. Get in the car. I'm driving. You got a fucked-up arm, and I'm not getting in another wreck. I, unlike you, have a lot to live for. (CAR HORN BLARING) I always wanted a chauffeur, Reggie. Hey, man, I recognized one of those bikers that attacked the bus today. His name is Cherry Ganz. He's a fucking lunatic. He's Ganz's brother. Ganz's brother? Yes, he makes Ganz look like Gandhi. Why in the hell would the Ice Man hire Ganz's brother? Think about it. I ratted Ganz to you, and you killed Ganz. Who'd want to kill us more? Ganz said his brother used to fuck this bitch named Angel. All he used to talk about was how insane the pussy was. Said the bitch worked at a place called Barnstormers or something. Barnstormers. Yeah, we got a complaint a couple bikers rousted a bar called Barnstormers. Wait a second. The cops are actually contributing to this investigation? I'm shocked. Now, wait. How the hell do you remember where this girl works after seven years in prison? Hey, Jack, after seven years in prison, you remember every story about pussy you ever heard. Trust me. Wait a minute. I gotta get something. Ah! Hey, Jack, this shit is fake. So what? People don't know the difference when you flash it fast. REGGIE: Somebody spooks that fake badge in there, and you fuck around and get your ass whipped, don't come crying to me. I ain't got nothing to do with it. You just watch your own ass, Reggie. (POP MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ We were two lovers, one of a kind ♪ We shared a love that we were lucky to find ♪ We were as close... ♪ I'll go get some info. A barmaid called in the complaint. You go do your cop shit, Jack. I'm gonna check out these hoes. All right. Hey! You're the one that called in the complaint on some bikers? Oh, well, call the 6:00 news. Cops finally responded. Only been a day and a half, you know. Are you gonna tell me what happened, or you gonna bitch a little more? I'm gonna bitch a little more. You guys are never here when somebody needs you. Can I have a shot of Stoli? On the rocks? Yeah. Great. Hey, how you doing? Hi. Buy me a drink? Oh, baby, I just got out of jail. I'm dead cracked, but you can buy my drink. Fuck off. Hi.

I just have to powder my nose. Just powder my nose. I'll be right back. (CHUCKLING) Hey. Hey, how you doing? I'm pretty good. How are you? I'm all right. Yeah. Hey, you ever see those commercials on TV with the tourists? With the guy with the big nose? Karl Malden. The big-ass nose man. Did you ever see those commercials where he shows the people getting their pockets picked in slow-motion? Yeah. Shit! Yeah. Shit is a good word to say there. Right. But, listen, I can get your money back for you, but it's gonna cost you. How much? I think half your money would be good. Half? Give me a break! I'm giving you a break, man. You ain't got nothing now. The bitch is in the back, counting your money. Listen, she's gonna get your credit cards, run your rate up, and your credit's gonna be all fucked up. Look, you don't want to do it, fuck you. You got a deal. I figured I had a deal. So the guy with the dark hair starts asking about this girl who used to work here, then he gets rough, starts grabbing me and stuff. And the blond one pulls out a gun. Cute, huh? What about this girl? Angel? She stopped working here over a year ago. She's dancing at the Bird Cage up in North Beach. Hey, aren't you supposed to be writing all this down? I got a photographic memory. Now, you got an address, or where she lives? This is the ladies' room. You're not supposed to be in here. Well, y'all are leaving, so mind your business. Hey. I thought this would be a good time for us to get to know each other. You're very smooth. Very, very smooth. I've seen a lot of pockets get picked, but I ain't never seen nobody as smooth as you. I was just talking to the guy that you hit, and he's so upset. I told him that I'd come in here, and I'd get half his money back for him. That is, unless, of course, you offer me a nice little bribe, then I'll go out there and I'll tell him that you was a bit too fast for me. I am too fast for you. Hi. Almost finished. Was anybody else with them? No, they came in, just the three of them. There was this black guy. Yeah, skinny. Yeah, the oldest one was talking to a black guy. A black guy, huh? Here. Was it something like this? Yeah. Yeah. That's him. He was okay. He didn't bother me. Now, look, if they come in again, I want you to call down to the department. You ask for Inspector Ben Kehoe. He'll know what to do. You're in luck. Here's half your money. Great. What about my credit cards? We had no credit card deal. I said your money. Your cards are still in the bathroom. ♪ Gotta give it all you got ♪ Till you drop ♪ Now sometimes you win and sometimes you lose Jack Cates? Remember me? No, I don't think so.

You disappeared on me. Where in the hell were you? I was in the bathroom taking care of some business, then I got to come out and save your ass. I didn't need your help. I was not helping you.

Oh, I was just getting even. Now don't take it so damn personal. Come on, let's go. Let's get in the car. Man, I told you before to stay away from me, right? Stay the fuck away from me, Jack.

Jack, coming to the station ain't such a good idea. Wilson's looking for you. Oh, Christ. He heard about the bar. All right, be out in front in 15 minutes with everything you got. You got it? 15 minutes. Kehoe, get in. (TIRES SCREECHING) Give me that. Here, you take the wheel. What? Steer. Jesus Christ, Jack. Got it? Yeah. "Hickok. Ganz." This guy is Albert Ganz's brother.

I talked to a special investigations guy in LA, said these guys are enforcers for their gang, the Brotherhood. Last two years, they've been linked to over 15 deaths. Brake! Brake! Christ.

I couldn't come up with a match on him. (EXHALES) That figures. (POLICE RADIO CHATTERING) Okay. Right now you're looking at accessory to murder one. That gets you five to 10 years inside, and that's with good behavior, unless you cooperate with us, and then you might not do any time at all. Look, I told the other cop. I got nothing to say until I talk to a lawyer. Are you protecting this guy Cherry because you're in love with him? I can certainly understand why a girl could fall in love with a guy like that. What's he do? Blow through town once or twice a year, let his friends jump up and down on you, get drunk, and beat the shit out of you, huh? I can understand why a girl would love a guy like that. I totally understand that. Look, I don't know where they're at. They move around all the time. I can never get in touch with him. All right? Well, who can? I don't know. Those guys are nuts. Don't worry about anything. This is officer Jack Cates. Mr. Cates, Miss Lee here was about to help us out with the investigation. I think she was about to tell me the name of Mr. Cherry's contact man. The guy's name is Malcolm Price. He's big, spooky eyes, long hair. Nobody talks to Cherry unless they talk to him first. Okay. Now, where do we find this guy? I don't know. Hey. I swear. I only know a name. Thanks, babe. Hey, wait a minute! Hey, Jack. Hey, Jack. Where in the hell do you think you're going? Radio back to Kehoe, and tell him to run up a shit sheet on a biker named Malcolm Price. Good bet he's got a long record. We're out of here. I got to get a statement. Hey, man, your ass is gonna be grass. I'm telling you now. At the rate we going, you'll probably pick up Price at my funeral. Don't worry about your funeral. If the Ice Man gets you, we won't even find your body. You know what it is, man? We need to go somewhere and talk to somebody who knows about stuff like this. Okay, where? Honestly? Yeah. We should go back to prison. Oh, bullshit. Hey, man, you got any other better ideas on how to find out something about Malcolm Price? I got a guy on the inside who knows everything about everybody. He can finger anybody, man. Plus, it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to go to prison, anyway, 'cause you might be spending some time there real soon, and I think it'd be a real good job for you to go get reacquainted with some of the brothers whose rights you violated. Oh, don't give me that! I just arrest crooks. I don't make 'em steal. Jack, you don't get it, do you? You make it sound like everybody went down to a guidance counselor, took a test, and the results came back, crook was the only job they was qualified for. Oh, that's a real good story, Reggie. Blame it on society. Put it on society's shoulders. Let me tell you something, Jack. If shit was worth something, poor people'd be born with no assholes. (RINGING) Yeah, it's me. I heard about it. Well, hey, man, I warned you about dealing with these crazy-ass crackers. What? No, I ain't carrying. That ain't my thing. You know that. Look, I'm a businessman, too, but I just don't want to get too close to these guys. You know, man, these cats are taking all of the fun out of my work. Right. Yeah, I remember. I remember. I said you don't have to remind me of it, okay? Don't worry about it. I'll pull it together. Good morning, Kirkland. You got some visitors. INMATE: Hey, man, will you shut up over there! All right. Hold on. Get that picture of the guy. He's a small-time dealer. His name is Burroughs. Recruited by the Ice Man, I don't know, a couple of months ago. Okay, I wanna know, like, do you know anything about the guy he's supposed to work for? This main dude named Malcolm Price? Yeah, I know him. Western Brotherhood. You want these guys to do a hit for you, you got to go through Price. You got an address? I'm not 411. You look it up. Sunset Motel on the beltway. And give the phone back to Reggie. What's his problem? I don't know. Say, man, do you mind? I'm trying to talk to the brother here. I'll handle this. Can you excuse me? Me and my brother want to talk, you know. It's black stuff. Excuse us. It's private. You mind? You mind? Yeah. Hang on. Just... Look, can you go over there, please? Thank you. It's private. All right, all right. Reggie, look. Now that I've given you something you need for the second time... Yes, you have, and I appreciate your patience, and thank you. You will repay your debt to me! Hey, man, not to worry. We got lots of backup. Come on in and have a drink. (SILENCED GUN FIRING) (GROANING) (BODY THUDS) Malcolm Price. Must have been a real good lead, Jack. Somebody shot him 16 times. I've been chasing this goddamn Ice Man for years. Every time I get close, it's another goddamn dead end. This job will drive you crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jack, the Ice Man's a cop. No way. Hey, come on, Jack. Put this shit together, man. Jack, think about it. You called for Price's address. The Ice Man shows up there first. It's a coincidence. Bad luck. That ain't no damn coincidence. What about the brother whose picture you've been showing around? You get any feedback on that, yet? Well, that don't mean nothing. You gotta run a mug shot through NCIC. It takes time to get a make. How long that take? Hours. It's been hours. Well, sometimes it's slow. Come on, man. That's a lame excuse, Jack. Let me tell you why the Ice Man wants to kill me. Has nothing to do with the money that I took, okay? That's fly shit to him. He want to kill me because I seen him, Jack. I can identify him. I'm back on the street. He thinks I can blow his cover. The same guy that's trying to kill me is fucking up your investigation. Find out which guy is putting up the most resistance 'cause you're on this case. That is probably the Ice Man. Only guy it could be is Wilson, and that prick's been dogging my ass for years, ever since I started looking for the Ice Man. All through this thing. Listen, I got to get you over to the hearing so you can ID this guy. Come on. What hearing? The one where they're going to decide whether they're gonna put me in jail and take away my badge for good. Started two hours ago. WILSON: After the incident in the Mission District, Inspector Cates dredged up this theory of a criminal mastermind running the drug traffic in the Bay Area. For four years, in my opinion, he has wasted department resources and manpower, risked other officers' lives to vindicate himself and his theories. Can you describe Inspector Cates' professional attitude? When a police officer takes it upon himself to violate department regulations and suspects' civil rights, it makes it hard on every good cop who's out there trying to do his job. Objection, Your Honor, these remarks have nothing to do with the incident at hand. On the contrary, Your Honor. I'm trying to show a pattern of behavior on Inspector Cates' part that will illuminate the events at Hunters Point Raceway. I'll let the testimony stand. (TIRES SCREECHING) JUDGE: In consideration of the preliminary evidence presented thus far by the State and in adherence to the laws, statutes, and rules as specified by the State of California, city of San Francisco... There he is right there! (GAVEL BANGING) JUDGE: Order! Order! Please, let's have some order here. This is an official hearing. No, it's some other guy. No, no, no! Right there! I'm looking at him, Jack. It's somebody else. That's not him. No, God damn it, that's gotta be him. Who are these men? That, Your Honor, is Inspector Jack Cates. That's definitely not the guy. No, that's got to be the goddamn Ice Man. People change. Hey, man, you don't forget somebody you took half a million dollars from. That's not him. Well, God damn it, it's gotta be him! That's gotta be the Ice Man! JUDGE: This is too much! This court rules that there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a criminal trial against Inspector Jack Cates. Trial date will be set for the earliest opening on the court calendar. This hearing is adjourned. (GAVEL BANGS) (DISTANT SIRENS WAILING) Ice Man whacked out Price. You want to talk about it? The man had no choice. Your girl ratted him out to the cops. Bullshit. I don't bullshit. You both know her. She works as a dancer, lives at the King Mei Hotel. You know, you two should be a little bit more careful about who you hang out with. Who pulled the trigger? What's the fucking difference who pulled the trigger? The cops were getting too close. That's the way the Man does business. Business, not personal. You know, you two fucking hillbillies should learn the difference. Business. Yeah. (GROANING) That's business, too. (GROANING) (LAUGHING) You happy now, asshole? That still doesn't change the job. You got to kill Reggie Hammond. And how are we gonna do that? Kirkland Smith, he's the dude who kept Reggie alive in the joint when we had papers out on him. Reggie owes him. I figured out where he's gonna pay back. The dude's got a daughter works in the Goodwill store in the Haight just off Central. Well, you know what we're gonna do? We're going to get Hammond, and we're going to get the cop, and the Ice Man, and we're going to kill them all. You just stick to Hammond, Joe Bob. That's the gig. (PHONE RINGING) I keep forgetting the combination. Hey, Jack, I don't want to see you clear out your locker, man. Let's get back out on the streets. We can get this guy. You know, Reggie, I've been a cop for 20 years, and all I've ever been around is pimps, murderers, and robbers, but between you and me, I've always been straight. Now, you did your best. So, here's your 475 thou. You kept my money in your locker? Yeah. In a police locker, Jack? Yeah. Hey, we got no more ties. You're a free man, Reg. Now, listen, my advice to you is take this money and disappear. You sure, man? Yeah. All right. All right. Thank you. Have a nice day. (WOMAN CHATTERING) Hammond. Reggie Hammond. This is $75,000, courtesy of your father. This money comes from Kirkland Smith? It's got to be dirty. Hey, wait a second, now. We both know your father's no angel, but this money is not stolen. Your father did a favor for me. I just got out of jail. Had some money before I went in. I owed some money to your father, and he thought it would benefit you. A lot of fathers wouldn't even do this. I think you should accept it. Bye-bye. Mr. Hammond. How is he? He's good. You should go see him. Maybe. No. No maybe. You should go see him. (WHIMPERING) Shh. Shh. Shh. (PHONE RINGING) Hey. Hey, Ben. Sorry I couldn't help more, Jack. It's all right. You did what you could. It'll be pretty fucking dull without you around here. (CHUCKLES) Can't believe you're not coming to work tomorrow. Get a beer? Maybe later. You got a bunch of messages, Frank. Thanks, Joe. (RINGING) Yeah. CHERRY: We got Hammond. Good. Is he dead yet? There's a change in plans. Killing one of us wasn't part of the deal. What kind of shit are you trying to pull? You want this guy dead. We want 500 Gs. That's the price for you doing one of the Brotherhood. What the hell are you talking about? 500,000, or we let Hammond finger you. There's a place out of Modesto... What, are you nuts? No way. You want more money, pick a new place, something indoors, something with lots of people. Hey, Jack, this just came in. Some guy named Burroughs looks just like the guy you were after. They found him dead in the Mission a little while ago. Here's his sheet. It's a mile long. I circulated this guy's picture at the precinct last night. I got nothing. That's funny. Cruise busted him last July. Cates, even though there's no love lost between us, I just want you to know it hurts me to see a man throw away his career. So let's let bygones be... (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) Hey, I'm looking for the Cage club. The upstairs part. Fifth floor. You got to join. 50 bucks. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (COUNTRY-ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) You don't look too happy, Reg. Sorry, babe. Look me up later, and I'll buy you a drink, all right? (MEN WOLF-WHISTLING) Where's Hammond? Who's the girl? Just somebody he was with. Five hundred Gs, right? Now, let's check the merchandise. Take him out behind the building and blow him away. Shoot the girl, too. Shoot both of them. Yo, man, what's this guy doing here? Thought you said the Ice Man was gonna bring you your money. That guy ain't the Ice Man. You're just trying to save your ass, Reg. That's bullshit, man. That ain't the Ice Man. That guy is a cop. You're getting set up. They got the wrong guy, don't they, Cruise? Hello, Jack. It's Christmas here, Willie. We can take 'em all. Hammond, the pig, the Ice Man. The whole ball of wax. That's him! That's the Ice Man, right there. Pretty good, Jack. You always were a smart cop. You know, Ben, I really didn't want to believe it. Sorry to let you down, Jack. All I want is the Ice Man. You two take the money. Get the hell out of here. Ain't nobody leaving here with my money. Money? I want the fucking Ice Man! (BELLOWING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) Get the fuck out of the way! (RAPID GUNSHOTS) (BELLOWING) (GROANING) Come on, you fuck! Somebody help me! Shut up! Get away! No! No! You fucking bitch! You fucking bit me, you fucking bitch! (SHOUTING) You set me up, Ben! You never ran that shit through NCIC. You had Cruise pick up the gun that day at the track. I needed leverage on you, Jack. You were getting close. (BELLOWING) (GUN CLICKS EMPTY) (CLICKS) (CHUCKLING) (WHOOPS) (CLICKS) (CHUCKLING) Fuck you! Jack, we can work this out. Just let me out of here. You're a disgrace, Ben. Nothing worse than a bad cop. Hey, Jack, thank you for a very pleasant day. Okay? I got no car, I got no money, and I'm gonna fucking end the day off with this goddamn dope man's Uzi by my temple. Thank you, Jack. Look, this is Jack's day. Why don't you just let Jack shoot me? Save your bullet. Jack, why don't you shoot me? Shoot me, Jack! (SIREN WARBLING) Coming through. Coming through. Oh, Jack. I can't believe you shot me, man. This shit hurts, man. Well, I told you, you should have bought a damn bulletproof vest. You did good, Reggie. You did real good. Doc says you's going to be fine. Guess I'm a pretty good shot, huh? You're going to have to take it easy for a while. I'm sorry you had to knock your friend, man. He wasn't my friend. You're my friend. Besides, I had to save my partner, didn't I? I got this off the Ice Man. It's 500 grand. I'll meet you at the hospital. We'll talk about it, okay? JACK: Here. Hold this for me.
