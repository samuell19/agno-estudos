Ugh. Relax, Wally. We're inches away. There's a quarter of a billion dollars in gold on that train, and you act like it's a load of tires. My shirt, please, Auntie. Don't call me that! Then stop acting like one. Haven't I always taken care of you? Relax, Wally. Trust me. Trust me. Son of a bitch! Get out! What the hell was that? Gas! Gas! General Truscott, Officer Simmett. All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has ever come to me thus far is the honor and the privilege of having commanded the third army. The great successes we have achieved together have been primarily to the fighting heart of America. Please accept my heartfelt congratulations on your valor and devotion to duty. And my fervent gratitude for your unwavering loyalty. Goodbye and God bless you. All Hail George. Come in. What is it, Stewart? What is that garbage? I have more papers for your signature, sir. Papers. Papers, son of a bitch, that's all I hear. They've given me a goddamn paper Army. Analyze supply procedures, do historical studies. It's all a bunch of crap! If Roosevelt were alive, they never would've done this to me. So I hired a couple of Nazis to help me run the military government. Who else knew how to do it? And those goddamn Russians. There isn't a man on the general staff who won't admit privately we're going to war with them next. Well, maybe so, sir. But, uh, telling it to that Russian general at the victory dinner with all the brass listening, maybe it wasn't a very good idea. I'm no politician like Ike. The only reason I got drunk was so I wouldn't tell him. What? What? This has been hanging around for some time, sir, but they expect a reply. What is it? General Ostranov wants your presence at Iszenok. General Ostranov? Yes, sir. Next. But, sir, it's protocol. Then you go. Protocol. I'm through with these Cossack bastards. Drunk or sober. Now, tomorrow or ever! It's good to see you again, general. General Eisenhower sends his respects. Thank you. To our glorious victory. To the United States of America. What the hell is that? You do not shoot officers in the American Army, general? Not very often, no, sir. We try to shoot people in enemy uniforms. But you would shoot spies and traitors? After a proper court martial, if the court imposed such a penalty, of course. What is the penalty for an officer who steals from the army and sells on the black market? You mean you're going to execute that boy for stealing? He took rations, clothing, whatever he could sell. He was a traitor to the Red Army. What would you have done with such a man, General Patton? Our Code of Military Justice is different than yours, sir. We don't take a human life that cheaply. I know about your idea of justice. The Americans are selling trucks, gasoline, tires, food, cigarettes, even their guns. And you, general, you and your high command do nothing. We throw the bastards in jail. That's what we do. Pardon my French, general, but you're full of shit. Come on, Stewart, staff, we paid our respects. The Americans are thieves! If they are not, then where is the gold from the Reichsbank? How l should I know? But the gold was under your command. It was your order that sent it to the vaults at Frankfurt. Only some of your men made sure it never reached there. If that gold had been stolen under my command, I assure you it would not be missing now! And the man who stole it would have faced a firing squad! There is no proof that Americans hijacked that train. General Patton, please. Even you know better. I must warn you that the gold is not yours to keep. It belongs to all the Allies. And we want it back! You want your gold? Well, general, you'll get your gold. I personally will go out and find it for you. Do you hear that, sir? I will find every goddamn bar! And when I do, you have my assurance that I will come right back here and shove each and every one of them right up your sweet red commie ass! Colonel Dawson. Second floor, sir. Come in. Major De Lucca, sir. Major De Lucca. Yeah. Been looking forward to meeting you, major. Heard a lot about you. Of course, uh, half these OSS stories you can't believe-- Never mind the bullshit, colonel. Let's get to it. I sure admire the job you did in Italy. What job was that? I've been responsible for 137 acts of sabotage, and a hell of a lot of statistics. Yeah, well, I'm thinking of one specific job. Oh, you mean the partisan I drowned in Lake Ariana? Or was it the factory that I blew up in Siena? I killed a lot of people. No, sir. I mean the train out of Milano. Oh, yeah, that. Now, that was an operation. An armored train with the Krauts' whole war room right in the middle of it. You blew it open, took Kesselring's whole defense plan. Terrific. It's brilliant. Gassing the train in the tunnel. Become a classic model. For what? The Reichsbank gold robbery. Then someone used your exact plans to steal the whole reserve. It's like they had your blueprints. Only this time, instead of killing Germans, they killed 59 American soldiers. Now, no one knew about that plan in detail except you and your OSS group. Are you investigating me? No, sir. But you know the CID. Paranoid. Yeah, I know them. Look, colonel, let's lay it on the line. You think there's a chance that I killed 59 GIs for a million, a hundred and fifty million? Whatever the goddamn figure was after what I've been through? Look, major, I am convinced that this was an inside operation. Now, I want your help. I'm the wrong man for the job. The war is over for me. I have my orders. I'm going home. Well, I'm getting you assigned over here to help break this thing. That'll be all, major. You'll hear from me. Heinz! Heinz! Raus! Fritz. Colonel McCauley? What did you do? You stole the whole goddamn castle? Just requisitioned it. Gotta have someplace to sleep. You understand? I need a clearance. For what? I wanna go home. You wanna go home. Everybody wants to go home. I know where you came from. You just saw a little ol' southern fried chicken by the name of Dawson, right? And a 16-year-old kid. Colonel. Young for a colonel. I saw him too. You know what? The OSS used to be the greatest thing during the war, but since then, all we are now is a bunch of thieves and murderers. Isn't that right? I wish the war had never ended. Really? Yeah. We just did what we had to do. Did you? And we didn't think about it. Didn't you? Alright. My lover. Buddy. Give me a couple of weeks. I'll do some of my, uh, very fancy, uh, typing, paperwork, with that southern fried chicken young colonel. He'll be so confused within two weeks, that you'll be back home in New York eating your favorite steak at your favorite place which is--? Toots Shor's. Medium rare. You're full of shit. How are you, you son of a bitch? Joe! Hello, Mara. Nice place you got. Yes. It's an improvement. How did you get out of Poland? The only way I could. A friend in the right uniform. I always wondered what happened to you. I waited for you. Did you? I waited in chow lines longer than you stayed around. Why didn't you come back? I'm sorry, the war got in the way. How the hell did they transport it out of here? That's what I wanna know. Begging the general's pardon, but that's all in the report we sent over to your office. Some jeeps were seen in the area that afternoon. We're trying to find out where they came from. I read your goddamn report and it's a load of crap. No wonder the Russians are shoving it in. The CID couldn't find horseshit in a stable. You're missing something, colonel. I don't care how many times we do this. They must have made a mistake and we're gonna find it. Clear? Yes, general. No problem, sir. No problem. Let's have some light. What was the crazy bastard doing? I haven't seen him like this since Bastogne. The Russians hold him responsible for the gold. He's taking on the investigation. He can't do that. It's the CID's job. What the hell does he care? He's taking it on anyway. The man is dead. Why doesn't he lay down? He's yelling that Ike screwed him, and he's gonna stick it to him good. He wants to prove that someone at SHAEF is involved. Rog, he's gonna find us. I'm telling you now. He won't stop till he does. Stewart! Where the hell are you? The gold's brought him right out of his cage. Hey! Hey, goombah! Goombah! I thought you were back at base. Waiting till ship docked? You didn't get to Dawson, did you? Not yet. Well, getting very comfortable here. They even got me a room. Not as nice as yours. Then you don't have to do the sort of entertaining that I do. No. That's history, okay? Yeah. Forget it. Mike, I went to your Paris bank. Did you? Someone made the deal. They sold a million dollars worth of gold. Say where it came from? They say a private investor. Might have been. No, I don't think so. I think I have something. It's real. Why are you messing around with Dawson? What the hell are you talking about messing about? This jerk has me on the gold case. If I leave it to the CID, I'll never get home. These are schmucks, the military, they go by the book. Me, I'm a Sicilian. To me, everything is a conspiracy. Yeah. Mike, everyone's making deals. So, somebody swiped your idea how to hijack a railway cart. Uh, what's that? Shit. The whole thing is turning to shit. I mean, the war was one thing but killing 59 GIs on your own side. I can't let that go. Joe, why don't you tell Dawson "go jump off a cliff." And go home, get out of here. And find yourself a real, nice girl. Get married. Have a lot of kids. And get rich, huh? You dumb bastard! Son of a bitch! American bastard. You know, you nearly blew the whole goddamn thing? Keep your voice down! Why did you have to get rid of that money so fast in Paris? What was that goddamn hurry? De Lucca found out the bank where you stashed away that million. You know that? What's he doing about it? Talking his head off to Dawson, and we have to get De Lucca home fast before he does anymore damage. It's in the works already, but we've got another problem. What? Someone's butting in. Somebody that I can't buy off. Who? Patton, George S. Junior. He's taken over the investigation. Which means he's not going to stop till he finds us. So to put it plainly, McCauley, we're gonna have to put him out of business. We? My part's done. Not yet. We gotta shut him up. Nobody shuts up Patton! Besides, I only fight guys my own size. What's the next stop? I'm gonna get off it. Too late, buddy. You're on the Board of Directors. If we hang, you hang. I didn't kill those guys. You sold me De Lucca's plan. Same thing. Does Stewart know that you're gonna knock off his boss? Just you, Gilchrist and me. Rogers, you're a sewer-- A rat-infested sewer. Now, I may drink just a little bit too much and play with the girls a little bit, and steal a little bit. But you're out of your goddamn mind if you think I'm gonna kill General Patton! My dear colonel, we're not asking you to do it. Everything you need, everything that you have to know, is in this briefcase. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Peter Shelley. A mutual friend, Esposito. You must have paid him a lot for the recommendation. Too much. Well, the black market in Italy has slowed down. The poor fellow has to make a living. You have a heart. I must have the wrong man. Mr. Rogers. Your dog tags please. Rogers, jolly dee. 01648008. Religion, Protestant. Blood type O. Any mistakes on your part, and you may have need of both. I think we're both aware of the price of failure. Do you mind if I have that back in case they have to bury me? We must try to have confidence in one another. Five hundred thousand American dollars. For that, I'd do it myself. How much? I never bargain. You wish a man killed. I didn't ask you why. I'm sure you will profit. But I must also benefit for my silence. So you pay in advance, 500,000 in small bills. Everything you need is here. Background information. Habits, staff. Everything. When? As soon as possible. December. Sometime in December. It must look like an accident. It will. Colonel Rogers. It's all set. Done. Good. McCauley, I want you back in Frankfurt. We've got another problem. Frankfurt? Ah, come on, Rogers, what's the hurry? I wanna spend a couple of days in Switzerland, uh, playing around. You know what I mean. Be in your apartment, 2100 hours, Wednesday. Alright. I'll be there. Wednesday. What--? What's the other problem? McCauley. I did not mean to frighten you. Not at all, fraulein. Matter of fact, I feel much better. Your friend will be a little late. And he has asked me to make you comfortable. I've had a hard, tiring day. I have ready a bath for us. Yes? With bubbles? With lot of bubbles. Pretty bubbles. Well, I'm maching all the schnell I can. Ah. There are bubbles for you. Oh. Steam. Yeah. Beautiful. I like it. Hilde! Dumb bastard. I wanna see all his clothes, everything he had on him. They're in the effects vault. The CID gone through this yet? Not yet. The examiner's on the way over here now. There's not much. Some coins, his gun, pack of cigarettes, ID. What do you mean cigarettes? He had a pack of Camels. Mike smoked cigars, he didn't smoke cigarettes. You guys gave me a tough one. A real ball buster. McCauley was OSS too, wasn't he? I guess that's why the CID here couldn't bust it. I mean, you cloak-and-dagger guys use such sophisticated codes. Too bad we didn't borrow this one to use against the Japs. Captain Levy, uh, you did decipher the note? It's a joke! You brought me a code a kid could break. Now, this is the date: November 3rd, 1945. On November 3rd, McCauley met S, regarding BG. Now S or BG had grey hair, eyes brown. Over 6 feet tall, about. 180 pounds, about. Now, this is a telephone number. Comstock, 6245. What the hell's that? Joe, I checked this out personally, myself. It's the Great Meadow Prison, upstate New York. Now, this last group of numbers were tricky. But I found out that it's the serial number of a prisoner in Great Meadow. What's the name? Lucky Luciano. Joe. What is it? Mike's dead. How did this happen? He was murdered. In an apartment in Frankfurt. Why? We don't know. Mara, did Mike say anything about going to New York? No. Did he ever mention a town called Comstock? Great Meadow prison. He never told me anything. He said he was going to live forever. Well, he almost made it, didn't he? I was going to throw him a wake. The old bastard finally got up and conduct the thing himself. Stupid, son of a bitch. He was kind to me. He helped me when I needed it. What do you wanna do now? Where you gonna go? I don't know. Well, you can't stay here. Mara, I wanna help you. I'm going to New York for a few days. I wanna know where you gonna be when I get back. No, Joe. We did it once before. Please go. Please. You have to understand, major. Mr. Luciano is shocked by this whole incident. The man you call McCauley came here claiming to be Commander Gilbert of the United States Navy. The man who came to see you is being investigated by Army Intelligence. Well, what's all that gotta do with me? Tell me what Colonel McCauley was doing here. He was selling me some war bonds. Frank, will you get rid him! You're in trouble, Mr. Luciano. Oh. What, you gonna lock me up? Just inform Mr. Luciano that if he and this Gilbert were conspiring against the United States government, his problems haven't started. Hey, you! Espionage during wartime is punishable by death. Espionage? Are you hard of hearing? Now wait a minute, major. You rotten punk! Do you know what I do for this country? I practically put the whole goddamn Army through Sicily! Then I fix it so the Navy can clear up those saboteurs on the waterfront! What else do you want? I want the truth. What about my deal? What deal is that? Now, let me explain it to the major, Charles. You see, major, for his services to the government, it's been arranged by Washington for a reduction in sentence. Maybe even a release. Naturally, Mr. Luciano doesn't wanna see that upset. That's the reason he cooperated with this so-called commander. If you don't talk, your whole deal's gonna fall apart like that: Tell him what he wants to know. Yeah, alright, alright! See? Mr. Luciano is always willing to cooperate fully and patriotically. Mr. Navy, whatever his name is, was looking for a hit man in Europe. The best in the business. A hit man. Now, you don't hear so good? You're lying. It's true! I know. I cleared it myself! Who did he want killed? That was his business. And you gave him someone? Yeah, sure. The guy said it was of the deal. The name. I want the name. Esposito. Gino Esposito. Naples. Naples. Where in Naples? I wand the address. Uh, since last Friday, the Holy Cross Cemetery. He was in the black market. Some MP blew his brains out. Yeah, well, that's it, major. That's all I got. Now, use your influence to get me deported back to my cell, will you, pal? Thank you. Hey, De Lucca. You're Sicilian, ain't you? How's your family? They're all dead. Major, lucky he was telling the truth. You know that, don't you? Yes, I know. Got time for a drink? No, I don't. You related to Judge De Lucca? He was my father. He was a good man. Very fair. You're a lawyer too I heard. That's right. You know, I wanted to be a lawyer once. Fat chance of that now, eh? Mr. Ferraro, the first time I walked into a courtroom, I looked around. I asked my father who are the whores and who are the spectators? You know, I tried to get in the uniform. Too old they said. Look. This is for your own ears, nobody else. Esposito was just a contact man, and they used him a lot. The man you want comes out of Switzerland. He's the best in the business. What's his name? Ah, Mr. Shelley. Come in. Can the device I described to you be made? Yes or no? With time and patience, anything can be made. It must be light and small. Easy to carry. Details. The construction can do all that you say. But the ammunition you insist upon, I've never known of it to be used in a firearm. Without it, the device would be useless to me. Then I must ask two questions you may not wish to answer. Well, ask them. What is your target? A man. And the range at which you must fire? Seventy feet. And time for no more than one shot. A third question then. Will the target be moving or at rest? I will try to make certain that my target will be either standing still or sitting. And you will not accept a conventional bullet? Impossible. You accept the commission? It will be difficult. But I cannot resist. One more thing, Herr Schroeder. I have very little time. We have that in common, my friend. Thank you general. Alright. Asking for liaison with intelligence pretty damn late. We were waiting to see what De Lucca could come up with. Don't wait when you're talking about assassination. But we weren't sure who the target was. Now the major thinks it's Patton. Patton. What do you base that on? McCauley. We found a coded record of his activities. Look, this is a goddamn dereliction of duty! Why wasn't my office informed? Because it was a CID investigation, colonel. And McCauley named Patton as the target? Not exactly. But we found the initials BG in his notes. Blood and guts? That's your connection? Patton dealt himself in on the gold investigation. Whoever engineered the robbery could've decided to deal him out permanently. Before McCauley was murdered, he made contact with an assassin. He better damn well hurry. Ike just gave me the word. Truman's ordered Patton home December 10th. They're putting the old bastard out to pasture. About time. You gotta have extra security till then, sir. Don't tell me my job, major! The target could be Eisenhower. Tried twice before that I know of. Some think Ike can keep the communists out of Europe. You already put a wall around him, sir. Damn it, it's Patton! Maybe! Maybe that's what they want us to think. We're all looking at Patton and Ike gets shot. Colonel, I want all the information that you have right now. Mara! Mara! Mara! Mara! Excuse me, please. Mara! Excuse me, please. Where are you going? Somewhere. You're staying with me. No. You're not running out on me again. I'm not. I'm just going. Where're you going? Help me? Wait-- Where're you going? I'll find a place. Did you find someone? Is that what you wanna tell me? Let me go. I need you. Let me-- It is ready. Tempered gun-metal aluminum, high carbon Swedish steel. Each part hand-threaded on a jeweler's lathe. First, the ammunition. As you instructed, it resembles something that might have come from the engine of an automobile. And now, the gas cylinder. You see, it is simple. That will give the absolute accuracy required. The range is 70 feet or more. I have carried out extensive tests. It was difficult to keep the skin unbroken and to crush the spinal cord. However, I have found the precise spot to hit. At 70 feet and a gas pressure of 4, the rubber will not enter the head. I will prepare your target. This is the spot to hit. And if your target is moving, aim a fraction to your right. Under the cover girls, it's the house detective. Well, how was it? You didn't come all the way out here to ask me that, did you? No. No. I picked up your mail. What're you doing with this tag? You mean what was McCauley doing with it? Someone sent this. From Lucerne. Who do you suppose that was, aye? McCauley had your name and serial number put on that tag. And now the guy he hired is telling us no double crosser us. If De Lucca tracks him down, we're dead. How the hell's he gonna do that? When even we don't know who he is. Don't get hysterical. We'll find De Lucca and stop him. That's all. Where're you going? I'm gonna be out for a little while. I'll be back soon. I'll go with you. I wish you could. I have to meet someone. Who? Look, does this tie go with this shirt? What do you think? It's very nice. Tell me. Where are you going, hmm? I came here to find someone. A man I used to know. Who? He works for the War Refugee people. His name is Webber. Martin Webber? You know him? I knew of him in the refugee camp. Some people said he knew too many Nazis. He's not a man to be trusted. I know that. Be careful, please. Mr. Bedwell. Do you have any further problems? No, sir. Good. Then the World Refugee Committee will meet again in Paris as scheduled on January the 9th. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The records. Our business has now concluded. Thank you. For God's sake. Joseph. What a delightful surprise. How are you? Fine. And you? So good to see you. Thought you would be back in America by now. I've got some unfinished business. Not with me, I hope. You and I, we are part of history now. Can I get you some refreshment? As long as you don't poison it. That was an old habit of yours. Yeah. Well, self-preservation. The war was made-to-order for you, Martin. You stole from both sides with equal grace. Listen. Which was the greater immorality? My petty crimes or the war itself? Petty crimes? You're lucky you weren't shot. Oh, please, Joseph. A little discretion. We'll reminisce over lunch. I know a charming place where we can talk without interruption. Come on. If you like chateaubriand, you'll bless the chef. Well. Not bad. This may be the first time in your life you told the truth. Oh. I do have my honest moments. I'll give you $5000 for one of them. Joseph, you were never that generous. You used to take what you wanted and then talk. Well, the rules were different then. I'm learning how to be civilized again. I never thought you were well suited for your work, Joseph. You were never able to look past your morality. Sorry. My father spoiled me. You know, some people have to be killed for all sorts of reason. You always asked "why." That time in Italy, remember? Where the partisan, Mario.. You jeopardized the entire operation by hesitating to kill him. He would have informed the Germans. There was no proof. Ah, except my word. You never even saw that operation. Of course I did. How? From the top of the Alps? Shacked up with your girlfriend? You knew about that? I never trusted you, you know. Waiter. Remy Martin, bitte. Yes, monsieur. So? I need some information. About? I'm looking for someone. The man I want is a hired assassin. A professional killer. Europe is full of those. Every former soldier with a gun, perhaps. This one is special. I see. Would you have any form of description? He's over 6 feet. With graying hair, brown eyes. Weighs around a hundred eighty pounds. S. Mr. S? Does that mean anything? Hmm. I don't think so. What else do you know? He operates out of Switzerland. I see. And you want me to find this fellow? Well, you know most of the scum of Europe. You should be able to find him. You flatter me, Joseph. I have reduced my outside activities since the war. My principle profession now is binding up the wounds of a ravaged world. Find him. Give him a message. A message? Tell him I know about him. Tell him I wanna meet with him. Make a deal. What sort of a deal? Hmm. That part I'll handle. I was mistaken. You haven't changed a bit. Mr. Webber's office told me where to find you. Are you alright? Yes. And you are? Mara Danelo. Oh, yes. How nice to see you again. Let's go. You know where to reach me. Excuse us. Of course. A man keeps calling. He says it's urgent. He's going to call back. Hello? Major De Lucca? Yes? You wish some information. Who is this? I may be able to help with the person you wish to find. Who is this or I'll hang up. Tomorrow morning, go to confession at Saint Paul's. The church by the hotel. First confessional on the right. Ask for Father Kasten and confess your sins. Are you Father Kasten? Be there at exactly 9:00. Father Kasten? Yes, my son. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Haven't we all, my son? Okay, Theresa. Okay. You didn't enjoy yourself. I'm sorry. I mean, you hardly spoke to anybody. All my friends there, hmm? I did enjoy it. Now, come on, tell me, what's bothering you, huh? Was it something I said or maybe something I didn't say? Somebody has been asking questions about us. Who? A man called Peter Shelley. What would Patton say if he knew you had a German mistress? Oh, come on, Theresa, half the American Army are living with German girls. Who is this Peter Shelley? I don't know. But it frightened me. Not this music. I'll be right out. Get me a drink, please, darling. Good morning. Cable, please. To Peter Shelley. Franz Schuberstrasse 15th, Lucerne. Can offer 500 Swiss francs for article on economic future of postwar Germany. Can arrange meeting in Frankfurt, if agreeable. Please reply my office, Wilhem Publishing, Ludwigstrasse 72, Berne. Your name, please. Heinz Wilhem. I trust your urgent information can tell me who killed Colonel Stewart. Same man who's after Patton. Are we speculating again? No, sir. Stewart's death confirms that Patton is the target. He knew the general's schedules and habits. The girl they found with him was Theresa Von Rodeck. She was really Dora Mueller. Her husband was a Nazi cabinet minister. The guy was probably using her association with Stewart in order to get any information he wanted. Then he shut them both up. The assassin McCauley hired had a code name S. Yes, Major, I read Dawson's report. CID Forensic traced the name Peter Shelley on this pad they picked up in Mueller's room. Shelley's a journalist living in Lucerne. Swiss father, English mother, sometime feature writer and novelist. No strong political convictions or party affiliations. And this telephone number? Shelley left for Frankfurt. We don't know where the hell he is. Alright. I'll issue an additional security order for Patton. Get our intelligence onto the search for this Shelley. And, colonel, if your men find him first, have them notify me immediately! Yes, sir. That's all. Colonel Rogers. Intelligence got a call about Peter Shelley. Where is he? A gasthof in Wilden Hirschen, Hofmannstrasse. Thank you, Sergeant. Uh, yes, sir. I survived World War II and three marriages. Ah, now there you are. So here's to the end of the world, Mr. Shelley, sir. And may we live to write about it. Mind you, the way I'm going, I think you'll be here by yourself. How many damn gasthofs does De Lucca want us to check out anyway? I thought the Irish had all the luck. But, Shelley, my friend, you seem to have appropriated a bit. Where did you find this rich uncle? In Berne. He's a new publisher, Heinz Wilhelm. I'm to meet him here tomorrow. And how much did you say he was paying? Cable said 500. In Swiss francs. You don't suppose he'd be interested in doing a story on four-power control of Berlin, do you? Uh-uh. Well, um, what about two-power control of Ilsa? Some dinner, meine herren? Of course, my darling. I will bring you a menu. May l see your register, please? How long has this man Shelley been here? He came this morning. Uh, uh, that's him. There. The man with the grey hair. Is-is-is something wrong, sir? Don't get excited. Just take it easy. Yeah. Where's your telephone? In-in my office. Please. Close your bar. The curfew's still enforced. B-but we-- Close it. Watch him. But keep out of sight. Siegfried, hold it. That's it. We're closing. Look, eh, meine Damen and Herren, ladies and gentlemen, we are closing. The bar is closing for tonight. Drink up, please! Drink up, please! Where is he, Rowan? Hotel Zum Wilden Hirschen, Hofmannstrasse. Hotel Zum... Wilden Hirschen. Wilden Hirschen. In Hofmannstrasse. If Shelley tries to leave, grab him! I want him alive. No one goes near him, you understand? We're on our way. Alright! Do you know what means to have, uh, trouble... You have to. You see, I have to close because we have trouble with the police, you know. Well, thank you very much. Maybe tomorrow, yes? Thank you. I'll tell you, I'll see you tomorrow. We'll have another bottle. It's fine. Alright. Yes. Sleep good. Which room is Shelley in? Uh, number 27. A-a-at the top of the stairs. Get rid of the waitresses. And disappear yourself. Ja. Leave everything as it is and-and, uh, go home. Quickly. Hurry. Schnell. Let's go. Excuse me, sir. Major De Lucca's orders were not to let anybody through. Lieutenant, this is a SHAEF Operation. Where is he? Did you hear me? Corner room, sir. Ah! Easy, Wally. Ah! ID. Stack! Stack, where the hell are you? Sir? What day is this? Why, it's Sunday, general. Then we're going hunting as usual. Sorry, sir, I thought with the security measures still in effect, we'd call it off. They caught the sons of bitches. What do I need security for? I would have found that gold if they weren't sending me home. They can't keep me from hunting, can they? No, sir. Find anything? No. I checked out all the people who were here last night. Nothing. What did Patton say? He wants me to send a report to Eisenhower today. Said he always knew that those bastards from SHAEF were involved. Now that it's over, he's ignoring security. He's going hunting. It's not over. What do you mean? It's not over. Something stinks here. What do you expect to find? With Patton going home, an assassination wasn't necessary. Rogers had to get to Shelley to silence him. How the hell did he and Gilchrist get to him before we did? Someone had to tip him off. Well, Rogers had informants all over town. Anyone could've made that call. Shelley could've made it. Shelley called him then he waited in his room to get shot in the head? Where was his gun? Where the hell was Shelley's gun? He was a professional. He would've slept with the damn thing! Look, colonel, McCauley, Stewart, Rogers, Gilchrist, they're all dead. I've gotta believe it was someone else. And it wasn't this Peter Shelley either. Well, I gotta do that report for Eisenhower. You do that. My priority is to make sure that Patton isn't killed. I'm gonna go see Patton. He's in his hunting lodge. He's not gonna see you. He's all packed to go home. Well, he can call my mother when he gets to New York. What are you doing here? Joe, tell me about Webber. Webber? Yes, are you working with him? What's the matter? Are you alright? When you were in Berne with Webber, someone tried to kill you. Now, he's here in Frankfurt. Webber is here? I saw him. He was in an American uniform. What? I saw him this morning! It was him alright. I know his walk, the way he moves. He was always doing that, impersonating other people. Yes. I know because I lived with him. When I thought you were never coming back in Poland, he was the one who looked after me. That's alright. It's okay. After you met him in Berne, he called me. He still wants me. He said I would be with him again soon. When I saw him here today, I knew what he meant. That something will happen to you. Joe, he's come here for you, hasn't he? No. It's not me he wants. Come on, get in. Many thanks for your information, sir. Get ready. Get ready. General Patton's on his way! Get ready! He will be here soon! He's coming! He's coming! Go on, get ready! Get ready! Looks like you've got a reception committee, general. Who the hell arranged for this? You? No, sir. Well then, who did? I don't know, sir. Pull over, sergeant. Yes, sir. Another damn reception. We thank you so much, General Patton. Uh, thank you. Thank you, very much. This damn window's broken! Let's get out of here. Yes, sir. Make a note to get that DP Camp fumigated. Yes, sir. Where's he hurt? I don't know. It all happened so quickly. We came down around this curve. We didn't see anything. And then we just rammed right into that truck. Excuse me, gentlemen. Certainly. Look at this. This way. Get those civilians out of here? Yes, sir. What happened? Patton's car crashed into that truck. Doc thinks his neck is broken. Some crash. The driver must've been drunk. Anyone else get hurt? No. They were shaken up. But Patton's hurt pretty bad. You, uh, serve with him, sir? No. He was shot. I told you, major, it was an accident. The car just hit that parked truck. I wanna see the driver of that truck. I wanna talk to him. Sorry, major, but we don't know who he was yet. Where's Patton's driver? Uh, he went to the hospital with the general. Major, what's this all about? I was with the medics when they examined him, sir. And I'm telling you no one was shot! What's this? I don't know. That looks like a bushing, maybe. Is the general alright? Excuse me, sir, but half the Army is showing up. Come here. You get up that hill and don't let anybody down. Yes, sir. Okay, go ahead. Talk to them now. Thank you, sir. Anyone see what happened? Yes, sir. We were following the general's car. They just turned out into that truck. It was an accident. Lieutenant, we need a report from you. Yes, alright. Has he been taken to the hospital? Sir, this is the vehicle struck by General Patton's car causing extensive damage of the right.. General Stackwood was sitting there. And General Patton was sitting over here where he sustained serious injuries. What a fool place to park a truck? It was Patton. His neck was broken. It was Webber. I know it. Somehow I know it was Webber. Oh, God. Patton. He'll come for you next. Let me worry about that. I know a way we can. Listen, you stay out of this! No. I've had too much taken away from me. He's not going to take you. I know what I have to do. And neither you or anyone else is going to stop me. Do you have a letter for me? My name is De Lucca. Joe. One moment please, sir. I shall get it. Here, this one. Let's go. Here. Shelley! It's all over, Martin. Let's go.
