Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was a kingdom. But it was not a kingdom like all the others. Because its Queen was Fantaghiro... The Warrior Princess. Now that the time for struggle and war was over Fantaghiro could never imagine that she was going to live out her greatest and most dangerous adventure. Chiomadoro, look how beautiful our kingdom is. The plants are full of flowers and fruit. And my barn will already be full of sweet smelling hay. How can you be so insensitive to nature? The beauty of the landscape, doesn't it move you? Really move me, no. Let's just say that I like it. To tell the truth not as much as a good meal. You're incorrigible. You'd do nothing but sleep and eat. Come, let us gather a few flowers. No, they make me sneeze. You know. I'd rather go back home. Alright. Then wait here. Flowers. But what's to be done with flowers? Can't even eat them. Now if we'd gone to collect a little hay then I could have understood. But what's this smell? It seems my favorite smell. Hay. Yes, it's hay. Then this forest has something for me too. Quit messing about. Stop. Keep still. Come back, I've not even tasted it yet. Come horse. A few more steps and you can eat as much as you want. Come back. Stop it, Chiomadoro. Just a minute and I'm done. Fantaghiro! Chiomadoro, where are you? If this is one of your jokes for going home, I'm not pleased. Looking for your horse? They've taken me prisoner. Who are you? Give me back my horse immediately. It's a shame you're not armed. Too bad for you, but I've always an old friend. - You said it was a walk. - Thank you. Come on, come on. What are you scared of? Courage. Five against one. Come on, who's next? Get off me! We've got a good catch. Let me go! Enough! Let me go! Shut up! Where are you taking me? Shut up! Let me go! Behave yourself! Here no one will hear you. Who ordered you to kidnap me? You'll soon find out. I should have known you were the only one able to organize all this. I'm afraid that you'll never change, Dark Witch. Because I believe in my values, not in yours. I am a witch and I want to behave as such. But because of you I no longer know what is evil. But you can always do good. Do you think that's a thing to say to a witch? Because of you I've already lost my reputation. If I continue like this I'll be struck out from the black book of evil! And you kidnapped me just to tell me this nonsense? Now you've had your say, can I go? Let's see if you can. What do you hope to achieve? Sooner or later someone will come looking for me! That may well be. Just that they'll never find you. Want to know why? Because tomorrow morning at dawn... You will die. Dark Witch, wait! Let's talk! There are other ways to resolve your problem. I don't think so. Only evil can resolve evil. Who said that? Who are you? Have you never heard of He Who is No More - and of The World Beyond? - No, never. So maybe you donâ€™t know there exist many other worlds besides yours. Worlds lost in time and space. Why remain masked? Because I'm very different from you, and could frighten you. No face could frighten me. Besides you have a voice that inspires confidence. Not even a face like this inspires fear? No, it makes me smile. It reminds me of a fruit basket. Don't laugh at me. I would never do such a thing. But you've cheered me up a bit. Could you untie me please? Yes, I can try. - Ahh! - I beg your pardon. - I'm so sorry. - It's nothing. I'm sorry. But tell me. Is there also here the plant of desires? No, I've never heard talk of it. No, I feared not. Without that plant I'll never be able to return. Will never again be able to return to the World Beyond. - It's there that you come from? - No. I was born from the magic of He Who is No More The Nameless One, who travels from one world to another Looking to conquer all and where he arrives brings war, destruction, death. There was only one world where I could hide. A world where they know neither war nor violence, no weapons. A world of eternal peace. A world of love. The World Beyond. The harvest is richer than usual. The fish can be caught all too easily. No, the auspices are not favorable. You do not have to store food. Get rid of those supplies! Let's see what they say, the sacred shells. They continue to give me the same prediction. What are they saying? They say something is about to change. And when it happens... It will be a disaster. It's something that even I don't understand. Here! They say... there will come soon the day when will arise from the earth bad fruit. The rotten fruit of evil. And it will no longer be us that eat these fruit. And they say that for the first time it will be our food that will eat us. Mummy, Mummy! Mum! Mum, look what I got! Look how big! Very well, Masala. Don't put it to dry in the sun. - I'll cook it and we'll eat it tonight. - Mum. That fish is so big, isn't there a bit too much for the three of us? - Who would you invite, Ezela? - Well, Sarsut. Then I would have caught one even larger. - Is that right, Sarsut? - Yes. No. But maybe tonight you won't be hungry. You've already eaten. Eaten, me? I'm not eating anything. It's days since I've eaten. I'll gladly accept your invitation, lady. - Give it here! - I don't know what my sister sees in you. He makes me laugh, and then he's nicer than you. Masala, stop picking on Sarsut. See you later, Mum. Wait, I have to go to the field to collect the fruit. Who'll look after your sister? Sarsut can, since they're such good friends. Birindi, Birondi, Birindami! Rise, branches! Asteria, wait for me. Please, for once let me enter your secret kingdom. What do you think you'll find here? I don't know, but this attracts me. It's the only bit of mystery in our world. You should be happy with this quiet life. Unfortunately it's destined to end. they'll attack us much sooner than you think. We'll be attacked, really? How do we defend ourselves? It takes weapons. Weapons? What weapons? Who taught you this word? It's weapons that started all evil. Weapons are taboo in our kingdom. I only know that anyone who'd dare to make them. or possess them would only be thrown in jail? I only said... Don't pronounce that word again in my presence! And now get out of here. Disappear from my view immediately. Otherwise I will be forced to turn you into a pig. Get out! What are you doing here? Nothing, going for a walk. Now you've just made him angry. You've come to spy on me? We spy on you? Certainly not. Well? Are you still around here, boy? What's going on? Masala, what are you doing? Careful now, I'm scared. If you only knew, how tiring it was. We've dug right down, in all directions. Yes, as you told us to do, Asteria. But we didn't find anything. There's no other kingdom. Well done, but keep on digging. before it's too late. No complaints! - What do you think you are? - We are moles. Right. And moles what do they do in general? Dig holes. Well then, behave like moles. Set yourself digging and immediately. We must find someone to come and save us. Very good. Now is my big chance to see what's under the ground. Are you really going into one of those things? But you're not a mole. I don't have to dig, it's already excavated. And if you get lost? - If you can't make it back? - I'll take the risk. No, don't go. Goodbye Masala, be careful. Come on, What are you afraid of? Somewhere I must emerge, right? Wherever a mole can go, I can go too. A monster! Help! Help, a monster, a monster! A monster! Damn. There's enough here for a whole army. Where d'you think you're going, child? I'm not a child, I'm here by chance. Didn't you know that whoever touches my treasure is destined for a cruel punishment? I didn't do it on purpose. Then how do you have that sword in your hand? Who put it there? Put it down immediately. But you have so many. I told you, put it down! Turn back! Or I'll get you, Masala! I'll get you! Go back! Stop, Masala! Stop while you can. Hey! - Ahh! - Hey, you lurking in the bushes, boy? You nearly made me fall. You're riding here, stranger? With so much open road you had to pass here? This here is a beautiful sword. Who did you steal it from, boy? It's mine don't touch it. And don't call me "boy"! I bet your father is asking what happened to his sword. I don't have a father. Give it back, it's mine. Want it? Come and get it. What are you doing, huh? - Ohh! - Why hop like that? That sword belongs to a witch. If she finds you've taken it, she'll turn you into a pig. Ohh! Now I'm scared. Get up, boy. I don't you want to steal it. My name is Aries, and you? - Masala, and the sword is mine. - Ah. - Eh! - I'll buy it. - Mm? - What are you doing? You've already got one. I'll sell it, such a piece would sell very well. But to whom? Over here no one uses weapons, they're prohibited. I've ended up in the right place. I'll resell them in another realm. Sell weapons? You do this for a living? I sell everything. But not only for money, I trade as well. Barter, you know? Do you need anything? Well, I can find it. Or if you want you can buy, even me. - You? - Yeah, if you had a fight with someone? Behold, you have a champion who'll fight for you. It cost little. Only room and board, if I'm hungry and sleepy. But where does someone like you come from? Where do I come from? Everywhere. Where do I go? Wherever. I have no land, no home, no family. I'm son of the wind. I go where my horse's hooves take me. So, what do you want in return for this old iron? Teach me how to fight. This is the eagle strike. The sword must fall from above. It should... take you by surprise! And this... Is the strike of the dolphin. Rapid movements. Up! Sure... Speed is important. But you know the first rule? I mean the essential one to win. No? Just pick an opponent less brave and stronger than you. It won't give you the glory, but it'll save your life. - And if the opponent is stronger? - Convince him not to fight. But if I can't? Then scram. - Take hold of it. - Ah. Mm. Not bad. The catching is called "dart of the cat." And now let's try some fencing? You try to fend off my thrusts. Strike from the right, from the left, from above. You have good reflexes. Your turn, attack. But if I take your sword What's the use of you fighting? Don't worry, I can find as many as I want. And where will you find them if your kingdom has no weapons? I know where they are hidden. And I don't believe you. There are thousands there. But I'm the only one who knows how to get there. Better than buried treasure, boy. I told you not to call me "boy"! If you feel so grown up I'll make a suggestion, man to man. Let's become partners, eh? We'll go into business together. You and me. And if you cheat me? No, I'm an honest person. Do you think otherwise I would have taught you "the eagle strike"? I invented it, it's a secret weapon. It's invincible. Now let's try again, eh? Eagle strike. Slow wheeling right. Head held high, proud look, like a bird. Good. Now slowly wheeling to the left. Bravo. Sword held high and now What the hell... - Grab hold of him! - What is it? - Leave him alone! - Weapons are prohibited! Let me go, let me go! Get your hands off me! Let him go! Get off me! No. Shut up! You now have what you deserve, stranger. For daring to break our taboos. Weapons are prohibited in our kingdom. - How should I know? - Eh I swear I didn't know. And also teaching a child to fight. I condemn you to the maximum sentence! - Take him to the village! - No! So that everyone can see what happens to those who breaks our laws. I had no idea! I swear it, believe me! Stop that! You must be joking! Stop it! You can't imprison me so. I'm a stranger. I didn't know your laws. D'you hear. I've a right to a fair trial. I wasn't born here. How was I to know your laws? I didn't know anything. It's not fair! It's not my fault! What a mess I've gotten myself into! Let me go! Let me go! Calm down, calm down! Where are you taking me? I'm a good person. In the water with the cage! What? No, not the water! No, I beg you! I suffer from vertigo! No, help me! Help, wait! Where are you going? Don't leave me here! Where are you going? Does someone want to come and get me out of here? Free me, please! Free me! Free us both, Dark Witch while you can. She'll never listen to you, not her, not the Dark Witch. Don't stain yourself with another crime. Don't make that mistake. You don't know it, but from realm to realm, world to world is spreading the power of He Who is No More. Before it gets here before it annihilates me too I must be in possession of my powers. I have to do one thing to get them back. Just one action, really unworthy, very cruel. For example killing you. - Don't you think you're exaggerating? - No, it's perfect. I don't see a better way of returning to my position as the Queen of Evil than to sacrifice a person all milk and honey, the most generous, the most altruistic. In short, Fantaghiro. Believe me, deep down I'm really sorry. I'm sorry? I said I was sorry? This is too much, off with her head! Oh, nothing personal. Nothing to do with you, dear. You don't have any serious fault. But try to understand me. Where do I find another victim like you and your reputation for goodness? Off with her head now! Mum! Mum! Mum, I'm here. Mum! Here I am, Masala! - Hey look, what's happening? - I'm scared. Hey, get me out of here! Stop! Somebody get me out of here! A hurricane is about to erupt! Don't leave me hanging here! Are you all deaf? No, don't leave me alone. You promised Lock yourself in, I must return to my home. No, stay, please. You can eat whatever you want. But at your place you've only apples and raw fish. - How am I supposed to eat them? - Stay, please! Something, we'll find something to eat! I can't stay, lock yourself in! Mum! Mum! Masala! Mum! Now it's up to us! Now it's lunchtime for us. Mummy, Mummy! Let's see how good you are! Let me go! Come here, lovely boy! Get off me! Now you can go! Have a taste! Mum! - Mum! - Masala! Don't stop. Run! Run! Mum! I'll eat you up! - Where are you, Mum? I can't see you. - I've got you! Not this way! Masala, turn back! Go back, not this way! Mum, where are you? Answer me, please! Hey you, come here, quick. Slip in this hole if you want to save yourself. Stop! You'll not escape us! Get off me! Ransack all the homes, look for the kids! It's dinner time and you're not yet at the table! Look who's here. A beautiful girl good enough to eat! My dear child, why do you want to go right now that it's time to eat? Hey little one? Please, Mister fish, let me go. I'm not hungry. You no, but we are! What a beautiful girlie! Surely you must be very good. Delicious. Masala, Mum, Sarsut! Help me! What's happening? Why shout? Quick, get me down from here! I've never liked raw fish! But we you we like you, sweetie. So do we! It's true, we like you so much. - Get out, you! - What a dish. Come on, let's run! - I'm scared! - Jump in! quick, quick! Come over here, over here! There are children out there! Come, come. They're on that boat! Stop that boat! There are the children! Come on, move it! Don't let them escape. Surrender! Yes, surrender. Where do you think you're going? Get out of it! You, come back here! - Run away! - Yes This way! Here, among these roots, hurry up! Hurry! Come, come! Come on! Slip into our holes, don't worry. We'll take you to safety. Hurry up! Get them! Children, down here. Somebody get me out, Let me out of here! You need me! Someone answer me, Pull me up! Can't anyone hear me? Listen to me! I can save you! Hey, I'm here! I'm here! Look at me! Hey, boy, finally. It's you that got me into this mess! Try to get me out! Help me! Look out behind you, boy! Pull me up! Try to untie that knot and pull me up! Not like that! Are you crazy? Not like that! Shut up, or I'll never get you out! Drowning, isn't the way to save me! I'm drowning! Will you come and help me? Move, will you? I have the key Asteria gave it to me. So what are you waiting for? Don't stand there, dummy! This thing is sinking! Hurry! Hurry! Take it, I'll throw it! No, don't throw! Okay, go on! Throw it! Come on! No. - Stop! - Stop where you there! Run, boy! I told you not to call me that! Whatever you're called, run! Take that! We're here. - If you knew what has happened. - Yes, I know. Come. Wait. Where's Mummy? Don't worry, we need to get to Asteria. And what the devil is this? It's that damned flying galleon! But now it's not flying. But it's a boat? Hoist the moorings, release the cable! You, come down from the mast! Whoever's up there is fishing. And we are the fish. Help! They've got me, help! Help, Masala! Hurry up! Jump off! Pull him up! I've come to save you! Don't think of me, rescue the others. Don't waste time, you're the only one who knows where the weapons are. Go on, I'll be fine! Come on, haul them on board. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Sure. It'll be dead easy. One strike will be enough. But why do it? What a question! Because they pay me. And is what they pay you worth a life? How you talk. Now you have wearied me. Put down your head. Think of the remorse you'll have later. What? You won't be able to sleep. Each time you close your eyes you'll remember you killed a woman. Stop it and shut up! Just a moment. I've a right to a last wish. You have a right to what? Well then? All those sentenced to death have this right. And I'll not give you this right because I'm too wicked. Kill her! But really she's right. A last wish is a last wish. Yes, I understand even myself. A mutiny. I cannot believe it. Alright then. So, tell me what you want. A last wish is a very important thing. I'll have to think about. Because I can't afford to waste it like that. Hurry, this way. Don't worry, I know the way. Thank goodness you're there. We're missing only three. Everyone else is here. Now we could use a great warrior. Where's your friend? Captured. If there's no other solution then I'll try. It may be that there is another solution. Where's it got to? Now where did I put it? The last one left. This is an extinct species. This is really the very last one. What is it? Let me see! This is the plant of desires. I am at your command, Asteria. Tell me with precision what do you wish. And I'll go to look for it in any other world. And our leader would be this one? And we send them against the invaders? Have not you heard? It can find whatever we want. And can find it wherever and bring it here. But in our kingdom there are warriors. I said wherever. There are other worlds practicing war and weapons as we practice fishing or collecting fruit. Don't talk to me about fruit. I'm so hungry. There are many heroes and many brave warriors in other worlds. Tell me what you want and I'll bring it here now. Immediately. But give me specific instructions - Because I can do it only once. - Choose the best. No, I'm sorry. I do not take any responsibility. The wish is yours alone and it is for you to tell me what quality and what features should belong to your champion. What do I know of arms and champions? Give it to me, we'll decide. - Oh! - I would like our... No, don't say it out loud, you must think it. Keep it in your heart. So I can read it in your thoughts. And while you think pluck one of my leaves. But won't you feel any pain? The search always involves a certain sacrifice. Nothing is as easy as drinking a glass of water. Well then... Her Grace has thought of something? Yes And because I have no more hope I wish only to die in peace. Well, good. Hurry up! Before she changes her mind! So I cannot leave with the weight on your conscience of what you will do. - I want to forgive you. - What, us? - Yes Because I know that, deep down, you are good. And that you once were children too. And you also have had a mother... That loved you deeply. And she dreamed for you a future full of joys... And of hope. Remember your mother? Yes, she was beautiful. And how I loved her. She always held me in her arms after giving me a walloping. I want her so much. Oh no! These tricks won't work with me! I'll do it myself! And just so you know, I didn't have a mother! I want a warrior expert in the use of arms... And courageous. Yes, I can do this. I want one who's intelligent, crafty and acts with cunning. One who knows how to command, but who's also good with their people And fair to their enemies. Rather rare, but one can try. - I have a wish too. - You can't, it's not a game. On the contrary. Of course, we need also a girl, it's only right. Not only boys. Did you see? It said yes. Think of your desire harder. Think hard, tell it. Don't talk, you're distracting me. I wish... I wish they were like my mother. Very difficult, but also very nice. Sorry. I'll try to please you. - What did you think? - Don't say it. If you speak your wishes then they won't come true. Forgive me, if I hurt you. Can I decide who will pluck the last leaf? Of course, little one. It's up to you to decide. Oh, thank goodness, that's nice. Now it's up to me. I don't know what the others thought. Think about what you want and you can't go wrong. - What I really want? - Then we're doomed. Then it's very easy. I want that they know how to cook. That would be an undertaking, but pluck the leaf. It's difficult, but I'm searching. Nor this one. Neither this one. This neither. Here. Maybe we're there. Perhaps I have someone for you. Goodbye, dear Fantaghiro. And for the last time, finally. Goodbye, Dark Witch. One day you'll miss me. I'll shut your mouth for once and for all? What the hell is this? Probably one of your sorceries. No, it's not so. You're tickling me. Wait, don't strike. Hey, who's butting in here? You've interrupted an execution. I knew it, in one way or another it always ends up like this! I did my best, I was really bad. Well, not too much. But now you must pay us anyway. Do you want to end it too? Here they are. Here, I'm bringing you what you wanted. But it's very hard to come back, I can't make it. Oh no! Here they are! I did it! Victory! I'm back. I am pleased to present, Princess Fantaghiro. Here they are. Where? - Here they are. - She's beautiful. She's so beautiful. What's that? A woman? Who asked for a woman? Where am I? Who are you? Was it you? What did you ask for? Leave her alone.. - She's my sister. - So what? That's no reason to mistreat her. On the contrary, you should be even more kind to her. He's never kind. And he's always angry with me. But, I'm always kind to her. So who got it wrong? No! I've no reason to reproach myself. She corresponds to all your desires. In short, I've taken her, so now you get to keep her. If it's you that's taken me, then I thank you. They wanted to kill me, you saved my life. Well done. We seek someone to save us, and instead we waste wishes to save her. What have you got against me, what have I done? And what am I supposed to save you from? You are in the World Beyond. But perhaps you don't know it. Yes, I do. I've heard of it recently. But I thought it was a world of total peace. It was. Ah. In fact, here there was peace... - Before he arrived. - He? Who he? The Nameless One. He Who Is No More. What is it? What's up? Prepare this one. A storm? Come. No, wait! There's some mistake! I'm a stranger, it's nothing to do with me! You chumps! I'm only passing through. What do you want from me now? Why am I stripped? Your clothes are not edible! But why? Eating clothes? - Come on, Get a move on. - Come on. What's happening? Now, wash him! I can wash myself. Let me talk to the Captain. Who's in charge here? I have a proposal to make him! It's freezing, you're crazy! What are you doing? I'll catch a cold! - You'll not have time to enjoy it! - Enough! Take him! At least give me something to dry myself. Prisoners of war must be respected. Did you know? And it's not even my war. How can I make you understand? But what is it? Ah, talc. Ah, full service. Thank you. Am I a fish? Yes, it's flour. Flour? No, wait. You've no intention of eating me, right? I'm so hungry! We want to eat! I'm so hungry! If I'm not mistaken, you should to know about cooking too. Unfortunately, if what Asteria told me is true I don't think you can eat. And why not? Because this invasion was preceded by a revolt of food - This was the prediction. - That's right. He who eats, will be eaten. And who's to be eaten, will eat. Such is the prediction. Does this mean we can't eat anything anymore? No, I'm sure it will pass. Maybe it's already over and we don't know. And how could we know? There's only one way, we must try it. Have you provisions here? Yes, I think so. Come with me. You should get a basket of old apples. No. It's safer if we try it alone. Have you a place to hide? Yes, everyone to the other cave. Come on. Quick, quick. I don't want to leave. - Wait before you close the door. - Of course. I don't want to leave. They are only apples. Nothing but good apples. Now we'll taste how good you are. The apples are carnivorous! I've never seen such a thing! Get ready to close the door! Hold it shut They're eating through the door! Quick, come and give us a hand! Asteria, heat the cauldron. Look what I found, the trunks are full of weapons. This will solve our problems. They're almost through, the door is almost gone. Don't worry. Now it's up to me. Quick, pass me the other swords. Throw them in the pot. Stoke up the fire, stoke it. Get off! Oh, good shot. Move, it's dangerous. Strike of an eagle. You're not a bad swordsman. I had a good teacher. - You're not bad for a women. - I do my best. Oh no, look, look at that big hole. - They're not just one at a time now. - I know. I've never struggled so much to make a pot of jam. Bravo. Please have mercy. Let us go back to our children. - Save us! - Please! Let us go. Why are you so cruel to us? - What have we done to you? - Tell us where they're hidden! Tell us where your children are and we'll set you all free! You mustn't tell them, even if you do it won't save you! You'll all end up like me, they'll eat you. Have mercy! You can't kill us! And who will prevent me? Your mercy, have mercy on us. Mercy? I do not know what mercy is and I do not care. No matter how cruel you are there has to be a bit of humanity in you. And who says that I'm... Human? Is it true you're a Princess? Yes, it's true. Is it beautiful, the world where you come from? To me it's special. - What's it like? - It's full of trees. Of mountains and streams. And then there are the people I love. They'll be looking for me. Masala was right. It's my fault if the plant of desires chose you. I thought I wanted someone like my mum. I did wrong. But you did very well. Thanks to you I was saved from a wicked witch. So you don't want to return to your world? Of course I want to return. Maybe not in to the same place you took me from. I'm very sorry to have torn you away from your world. I don't want to force you to fight for us. But it's no obligation at all. When I saw these children I read in their eyes their pain, their fear. But also the hope with which they look at me. And if I can help them I'll do so with all my heart. Even if you knew Even if you knew you could never again return to your world? - But I can return. - No, my dear. It's impossible. Never. But why is that? It's exactly the same magic. We use the plant of desires. There are no more left. - That was the last one. - You have to find a way. The Dark Witch is recovering all her powers. My people are in danger too, I must get back. It's impossible. I am the last of a great race. With me ends an entire generation of plants of desire. But you'll still have a little power left. No, I'm sorry. I no longer have my leaves. - They can grow back. - I don't think so. Resign yourself, Fantaghiro. I cannot abandon my people. The people I love. Please, give me at least some hope. Don't be like that. - Or I will not have the strength to fight. - No. You'll discover that our smiles are the same as the smiles on the faces of your people. But I I'll never be able to smile again. Ouch, be careful. You're wetting me. I'm sorry, little plant. Don't cry, Fantaghiro. Don't cry. You must be strong. And look at me. I don't know where my mum is, but I'm not crying. You're right. I love you. No, now there's a craze to hang me! Get me down! Oh no! Is this the respect you show to foreigners? I swear I'll never set foot in this kingdom again! Are you crazy? I'm indigestible! No, no. I'm not going to eat you. You're already too old for me. I only eat meat much more young and tender. Just as well. I'll give you to my soldiers. They fought well... And are starving. Why me? Please. I don't know who you are. But you seem to be the chief here. I can be useful. I can defend you. Ask your men how well I defended the children. I sacrificed my life for them. For my friend Masala. Have you actually seen my son? Then he's still alive! He was able to hide? - Have you talked to him? - Yes, he's alive. He's a really brave child. - He'll do anything to free me. - Halt, stop! Bravo, you're human. Make them stop. It's just to become more human that I need nourishment. But you can't understand and I'm not sure I can explain it. So you have a friend in this realm. And you'll also know where he is hiding. Yeah, no. I don't know exactly where he is. But he knows where I am. And if he knew I was in danger he'd do anything to save me. We too. The children of this kingdom... - Are very brave. - Thank you, stranger. You've given me an idea. Now I know how to ferret out your children. Now I know how to attract them to my trap. I won't cook you. I'll get you out of here. That's something. And I'll hang you out in broad daylight. Wake up everybody! You have to hurry! They want to hang the foreigner outside their galleon. How do you know? I managed to get in the ship, so I heard. I saw that they're preparing four gallows in the clearing which is right in front of the galleon. And if there are four of them they won't be hanging him alone. I need some weapons. A bow, arrows. We're coming with you. No, it's better that you stay here with the kids. You cannot help. - Where can I find the horses? - I know. But I need men's clothes to fight. At the mill there are some old clothes. - We'll see you at the mill. - Yes, but be careful. How do I get to the mill? I'll show you. It won't take long, you'll see. Your world is so beautiful. How can there be evil in a place like this? Before they arrived here these accursed invaders, there was no evil here. But hurry, hurry. This way. Run! Let's see. This no. This neither. Perhaps this. And this too. If this isn't bad luck... Bad luck nothing! Who are you? And how can you read my thoughts? I'm a worm. I'm in here in the wood of this chair that you broke. How sweet. - You're almost invisible. - Yes, it's true, I'm small. But it doesn't mean you can take advantage. And don't even think of coming to live here. And don't try to drive us out of this furniture of precious wood. This good wood comes from magical trees that once grew in these woods. I've no intention of expelling anyone. Just passing through, at least I hope so. The weapons are coming. But what are you doing on the ground, speaking to yourself? No, I was talking to the worms. This is wonderful. Since when do worms speak? If moles talk, we can talk too. - Yes but you'd do well to be silent. - Why? Because we have more important and useful things to do than talk useless beings like you. It's not nice to offend them. This is their home. - Show some respect. - Excuse him, he's rather nervous. With good reason. - Here, here's your bow. - And the arrows. - The sword. Didn't I tell you to stay with Asteria? Yes, but who'd accompany them? Fantaghiro, are you ready? I've brought four horses. Quick, all out so I can change. Hurry up. Get off me! - Come on, move, walk! - Damn you! - No. - Have mercy! No, no! - Get off me! - Don't shout. They hope your screams will attract your children. We'll flush them out just the same! All right. So you don't want to scream, huh? Then I'll scream for you. Children of the World Beyond! Four of your fathers are to be hanged! Three, I have no children! Put the noose around his neck! - This will shut you up. - Don't come here! You couldn't do a darn thing! - It's a trap! - I said, enough! You've no children, mind your own business! True, it's nothing to do with you. What do you gain with your courage? But they'll hang you just the same. But what courage? Just between the two of us, I'm wetting myself. Enough. We're not able to see them. We'll find another way to flush them out. Hang them! Had a good trip, gentlemen? Here's where you get off, right? Who was that? Stop them, don't let them get near! Get on the horses! This way! Up, hurry! Archers, fire! Get on! Especially that knight in the red cloak who's ruined my party! Fire! Can't we stop? I can't hold on any more, lad. Not before reaching the mill wood. We're already in a wood. But I don't know where the hollow tree is. You're a foreigner too, eh? I'd figured that from how you fight. Here, from this tree you can go underground. Ah. On a day like this who'd want to shut themselves underground? But the kids are in there. Is it also the hiding place where they keep all the weapons? Yes, why? Then let's go, and quickly. Are you good with a sword? You could help me. Yes, I'll get one. Indeed, not to brag but I'm the best blade in the area. In these parts that doesn't take much. They're not as good as you. One can see that you're a real fighting man. If you mean that as a compliment, thank you. For whom who have you fought? For me. Only for me. Then you won't have made much money. You fight for money? What else is there? Ever heard of ideals? What "Ideals"? We don't talk the same language, lad. Since you saved my life - There's no need pay me. - No, I... Not even thank me. I just wanted to tell you that my name is Aries. And what's yours? - You can continue to call me "Boy". - Fine. Ah. It's strange, there no one here. - Maybe they went to the meet the freed prisoners. - No Or maybe waiting at the mill. It's not possible. We have to go back. But this is a real treasure. Who could have imagined it? Asteria went to look for every weapon in the kingdom. And not to use them hid them here. So they don't need them. You know what that means for us? Because the two of us become partners, lad. - I don't want to do everything alone. - Do what? - We'll take the weapons, right? - In other words steal them? No, don't exaggerate. You said they're of no use. In your opinion what should we do? Come on, tell me. Sell them and become rich. And if we become rich... In short, can you imagine the life we'll lead? No, but you can explain. A life of leisure. We lie in the sun. Good wine, beautiful women. I know a kingdom where I really spent the most beautiful day of my life. - I don't know if you understand me. - Not exactly. Hey, heart of stone. I'll have to teach you everything? What is it? You only made war in your life? But if you listen to me you'll learn easily enough. I know two blondes that for someone like you - would do somersaults. - Really? And they've made them for you? Of course, yes. For you or for your money? What's the matter, kid? Why insult me. Are they to be thrown away? I am the prize. Of course a bit of money makes for a more cheerful party. And with all this stuff to sell you can celebrate a whole life long. Put it down. Put down the weapons and then go away! Are you crazy? I thought you wanted to help me save these people. But since you just want to rob them it's better for you to go. We can't do anything with that monster. I've seen it. I was there, it eats children. And to think Masala wanted to save you at all cost. Because I taught him to fight. I'm not what you think. But neither are you what they think. I'm sorry. Now you can no longer call me "boy." Now I know why I was immediately drawn to you. A woman shouldn't play with weapons. Really? And what should she do? She should think only about love. If that were so you'd be hanging right now from the gallows. First you save me and then you want to kill me? Explain to me why? Before I didn't know you. So... Let's get to know each other better. No, don't move. I like it like this. But I don't. What's happened? Aries, answer. He's fainted. It's better to tie him. How shall we tie him? As he deserves. But he saved my life, he's a friend of mine. He was only interested in the weapons. I don't believe you. Here's the proof. Next time, you'll believe me? - Do you know how to use weapons? - Not much, but we can learn. I understand, I'll do it alone. But not now, you're exhausted. I know you're angry. But for the moment it's better he stays tied. Maybe you're right, but I don't agree. Do you mean you'll try to release him? No, but only because we trust you. Very well, enough for me. So, you let them escape. They vanished into thin air But if you order it, we'll continue to look for them. No, there's no need. Sooner or later it will be they who'll to come to us. How can they stand it without eating? And then they'll know the fate awaiting the prisoners. Every pang of hunger this night will remind them of the fate awaiting their friends and relatives. Sooner or later they'll try to free them. They will come to us And so I too will soon be able again to eat. - Ah. - Are you crazy? Yes, from hunger. I'd eat anything. Then chew your nails and go to sleep. Don't you understand that if you try to touch the jam you'll be the one eaten? Pss! Hey, come here. Here! Are you sure I can eat my nails? - Shut up, go to sleep. - Oh. If I'm free, I'll help you to free your mother. My mother? Have you seen my mother? Yes, in the galleon. I talked to her. But cut these ropes, free me! Good, I see that I can believe your word. Have you seen my mother, help me to rescue her. Give me the dagger. Come on, give it to me, please. Since when do I take orders from a woman? You know that the only thing that interests him are the weapons. Give me the knife. I know, but then we're going to release her. Yes, but first we must devise a plan Or they'll catch us. But whilst you're here devising a good strategy You know what they're doing? Eating. And you know what they eat? Shut up! Do you want to terrify him? Do you find it clever to say such things to a child? All I said was the truth. They need to know whatâ€™s happening. You don't have enough guts to deal with this alone. Sure! To free you I came with an army. It wasn't that hard. I'll free her alone, my mother. If I wait it'll be too late. You've judged me too quickly. You better sleep. I'd never sleep when a a beautiful woman like you is lying next to me. Want me to tie up your mouth too? I think you like me a bit. Really? Because otherwise you wouldn't get angry. And wouldn't have tried to make me harmless with all this rope. It doesn't work with me. You're just a thief and even a conceited one. I'm a lot of other bad things, right? But why have I become so? Think about it. I had a father who educated me? No. And a mother who loved me? No. I don't even know where I come from. How can I know where I'm going? I don't have a home waiting for me... Or someone who loves me. I've got nothing. I had nothing. And all that I've learned I taught myself. - Don't try to move me. - Of course not. Because the Princess can't even imagine a life like mine. And how was yours? You never had to conquer anything. You were always served, revered, beloved. Because you always had someone who loved you. Right? Yes, and you can never know how much I miss him. So why risk your life here? You want love for all the world? Isn't it enough what you have? Go back to your kingdom. If only I could. Wait. Where are you going? I didn't mean it. Why are your eyes so sad? I'm thinking about my love. Of my kingdom and of all those I love. Do you miss them? So much. And this pain it takes even my strength. And if that pain went away, then you'd feel more at ease? Yes, of course. But it's impossible. Because this pain is part of me. What can I do to make it go? Unfortunately, right now, there's little to be done. You can't do anything. I no longer have any place to return to. And I have no more hope. Well, now you have all of us. Yes, but when everything is over... all this will be for you no more than a horrible dream. But what will become of me? I can do nothing but resign myself. It's terrible to think that the only hope is to resign oneself. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you sad. And I promise you that at the most I'll bring back your smile. This smell is familiar to me. Yes. It really is the smell of a beautiful child. Smells so good. But maybe it's just hunger. Maybe I'm imagining it. No! I can really smell it. This is precisely the smell of a beautiful, clean child. Where are you beautiful, clean child? Where are you? I can sense your rosy skin freshly washed. Smell your aroma. No. Now it's gone. Well, it must have been the hunger. But now I smell a stink... so foul. What an awful smell. But not just... any filth. This odour is the dirty skin of a child. So before eating it I'll wash it. What is it? I'm going crazy! My nose has gone wild. I smell children everywhere. Dirty, clean. Clean. It's a clean child! No, it's gone. Child clean, what are you doing? Playing with me or against me? Eh? Are you an invisible child? Where are you hiding? There he is! Now I sense that one. The dirty one. Dinner, at last! Who is it? Asteria. Can we remove the pain of Fantaghiro? What pain? Thinking of her world. Nostalgia, it hurts a lot. And then she's also worried. Because this fills her with so much pain She doesn't know if tomorrow she'll be able to fight. But she must. I know. But if we can't to take away her pain... Alright then. I cannot find it. Ah, memory. Where are you? Ah, here it is. It's this. The memory-suckers. They look so funny. What do they do? They suck away all feelings of the past. - And after you don't remember anything? - Oh no. You remember everyone and everything. But don't remember what you felt for them. They don't take away people or facts. But only the memory of feelings you felt for them. And then of course they vanishes even pain. Will we ask if she wants it. No, I don't think she'd like it. But I'm sure she'll suffer less and will fight more. Now stay here. I think it's better that you don't see what I'm going to do. Forgive me, Fantaghiro. What happening to me? I know you're upset right now. But tomorrow won't remember any more this anger. From tomorrow you'll experience new feelings. Be able to love again. But above all, you'll accept your stay in this new world with much more serenity. No, I don't want to! Your feelings of the past will leave you now. But you won't lose them. Because they'll be absorbed into these small animals. And I'll preserve them on your behalf forever. My father. My sisters. Romualdo, Tarabas. Don't desert me, don't go. It's all so distant. Forever. Forever. Ah. Forgive me. But starting tomorrow... you can start to think about this as your own world. And you can consider it your home. ï»¿1 01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,550 Let me go, you vegetables! I don't want to be eaten. Masala, I'm here! Mum you're alive? Aries told me. - I came here to rescue you. - No, you mustn't! You should never have done it! Don't cry! Be brave. Enough! What's all this whining? Don't touch my mother carrot top! Got it? Otherwise ... Otherwise what will you do? There is only one thing you can do. Do you really want your mother released? Then you have to tell me where the other children are hidden! Don't tell him! And I will free you and all the other prisoners. Quiet, you! This is a private conversation. Don't interfere. I won't speak! I won't speak! I won't say anything, I swear it. Even in exchange for this... delicious... cake? I don't want it. I don't want anything from you. Poor baby. How thin you are. How long is it since you've eaten? I can also be very generous, you know? Look, I'll give it you without asking anything in return. No, I don't want it. Don't be afraid. It won't bite. Here it's not like out there. Here food is food. It doesn't rebel. You can eat your fill. You want me to eat to fatten me up. So you'll have more to eat. Well, well, but you're a canny one! Eat it! Sooner or later you'll talk unless you want me to sacrifice your darling mother. No! I'd better not. Why not eat just a little bit. What can it do to me, a bit of jam? They're just baked apples well cooked. How can they bite me? Has it worked, your spell? We'll know only when she wakes up. She might be angry with us. She won't remember anything of the spell And will no longer feel nostalgia for her own world. She'll be ready to fight just for us. I hope I didn't sleep too long! No, the others are still sleeping. - With everything that's to do? - How do you feel? - Are you still worried? - Worried? Why? You ask some strange questions. Worried about not being able to return to your world? With everything to do d'you think I have time to worry about my world? - It worked! - Great! It worked, Asteria! Sarsut! Sarsut, look out! The prediction! The jam is alive! Get out of there! It wasn't me, I swear. Why did you eat it? No one was to touch it. I'm burning! Why am I burning? What's it doing to me? You ate it and now it wants to eat you. Get back and don't move. Come Sarsut! Don't move from there. It's Sarsut that ate it. so it'll be after us. Fantaghiro don't leave us! - Sarsut, be brave. - I can't take it anymore. With everything you ate you should be in good shape. - Maybe we've got rid of it. - I don't think so, look! To think that they always told me "Woe to you if you touch the jam! " - I understand now. - We're trapped. What shall we do? - Can you jump? - It's no use. I'll never make. - Come on! Come on, I'll catch you! - No, I'll I can't do it. - Come on, come on! - No! No! Be brave Sarsut! Don't waste time! No, it's coming! What are you waiting for? Go, jump! - Well done, Sarsut. - Hooray! Yes! But it won't give up. Hey, look! It didn't jump. It can't jump. It's so deep it won't ever reach the top. Come on. No, I have to resist even though it's good. Of course I'm good. Rather I'm super-good. I don't see why you should resist the temptation. And I only ask to be eaten by a lad as nice and cute as you are. Less of your tricks. I'm not going to eat you. Oh yes, come on, taste me! I've a double layer of golden dough under the cream. Want to see it? Please don't tempt me. And they are full of grains of chocolate... and crunchy almonds. I'm irresistible. What are you waiting? Devour me! No, Masala, don't eat it! It may be a trap! Don't listen! If you're hungry, eat! It's really very good! If it's really so good, you eat it. It was a very deep well, enormous. And I said, "Run and jump when you tell you. " But she lost her balance. Luckily I was there. I grabbed her at the last moment. Oh, yes! - Don't tell me you came to free me? - I have better things to do So what's happening? Nothing at all. I'm looking for a lighter sword. I also need a dagger. You want some advice? I mean, weapons are my speciality. Apart from women, of course. Your speciality is to talk too much. Well, this is fine, and perfect. If you go, don't leave me like this. Trussed up like a chicken. What do you want to do with me? - Wait till I've returned from the galleon. - Are you crazy? - What are you doing? - What I've always done. Defying the enemy face to face. But "The One Who Is No More" isn't an enemy like any other. Neither am I. And I was the cocky one? Hey! Stop! You'll never make it alone. Tell the children to free me! - Wait Fantaghiro! - What are you doing here? Back to the cave. But Masala has disappeared. We searched everywhere but he's not there. - Maybe he got caught. - Don't worry. Even if he's on the galleon, I'll free him with all the others. Yes, but how all alone? That's my problem. But if you don't return? At this moment there's only one place I cannot return to. And don't worry, I want so much to see your pretty face again. Romualdo, Ares, the White Witch, Dark Witch. My time has finally arrived. Yes! Finally I know how I'd like to be. Wait, who told you to take me? No, put me down, Asteria. You know I don't like... your face. Put me down. I wouldn't say yours is any more enchanting than mine. Stop admiring yourself. Get out of me. Or the shock will shatter me into a thousand pieces. No, my dear. This time I'm really ready. Really? And how is it you are so sure? Because now I have the emotions of Princess Fantaghiro inside of me. And I chose an image from her memories that I really love. And have you forgotten what you told me... A few years ago? No, what are you saying? I remember. I said: "Find the picture of beauty that will succeed in conquering your beloved knight And I promise that I will give it to you." Well, then I peered inside myself. See what is the new image I want. Come on, come on! Do what you promised. Make your magic! Here it is! Here it is, and just like that I want to be. This is a beauty he'll not be able to resist. No, what are you doing? You'll break me! Shut up! Let's see what you made me. But you're a good-for-nothing! I didn't just want to change my dress. What I asked for was a complete service. Okay, it means that we'll try again. And now that I'm beautiful I can wake up Gurdalak. And this time, you can be certain That he'll fall in love with me. If I you want my opinion I wouldn't be so certain. Children! Children! Children! Come here! Come nearer. Untie me. You can help me. - No, nothing doing. - Let's call Asteria. But where are you going? Wait! Do you think Fantaghiro alone can destroy the armies Of "He Who Shall Be No More?" You cannot imagine how bad he is. But I know. I've told you. Is he so cruel, this King? He is much more than a cruel king. Is he a powerful wizard? A sorcerer? No, he's not a wizard. He's so much more. The Nameless One... is an ogre! And the most cruel and hungry of all the ogres. - He's right. - We trust him. He was the most courageous of all the prisoners. He tried to help us. Don't forget that. Well said! If we don't help ourselves... We'll free you provided you teach us to fight. I give you the word of an ex-prisoner. I'll teach you whatever you want. Everything. But hurry. These ropes are killing me. Hurry up. Magnificent! I couldn't take any more. Now all back. If you don't mind. You're in my way. You much teach us how to fight. You want to fight? Try it. If you cannot even keep a sword in your hand! And you? Come on, try a lunge! No! See? Even if you wish, you're just not capable. There are those who can and the rest are hopeless. Goodbye! Don't go. I've promised you nothing. Yes, you did. You said that if we freed you you'd help us. And you did it? Children no, but we did. It's not the same thing, you know? Breaking one's word with a child just breaks my heart. But between us it's useless to stand on such ceremony. Right kids? Now goodbye, as I won't be coming down here ever again. Goodbye my dears. It's not yet time to go away, stranger. And now drop your sword. And that bag. Now you can turn around. But very slowly. Who the hell is this? I'm sorry, Where are we going? The galleon is far but the caves of Asteria are more quiet. - I was thinking of Fantaghiro. - That's nice! I thought... I mean, are you sure you can't return her to her world? But really? I don't have any more leaves. And then I don't think I can grow any more. Not even if you plant me where there is earth most suitable to plants like me. But we can try, at least. Try to do what? I've lost my train of thought. What are we trying to do? I'll plant you here where there's sun. What? Ah, yes, the sun. Isn't it a pretty place? Yes, but now that Fantaghiro doesn't remember her own feelings perhaps she'll not want to go back. What am I doing here alone? Try to grow. Don't you want to grow up? I can't wait. And then Fantaghiro has done so much for us. This is true. I want to do something for her. You'll see how happy she'll be when I'll tell her. Don't tell her. If I don't grow leaves for her it would be another disappointment, right? Come here, you little brat! The Nameless One needs your tender flesh. And me to thank you for the cake in the face I suggest by starting appeasing our hunger with you. Come here. You don't know how much I want to munch you all up. Keep still! Come here! It's not polite to run away before dinner. It's your time to come to the table, little Masala. Unless you have something to tell me. I won't tell you anything. I won't tell... No! I beg you, save him. He's not done wrong. Eat me instead of him. Eat me. If I want... you will be eaten too, my sweet lady. But I cannot do the honour of eating you myself. I do not eat the flesh of adults. It is too tough for me. But you will certainly be appreciated by my army. Take her! And salt her! Tonight you can eat to my health. Leave me! Don't hurt her. Tell me where the children are and your mother will be spared. No! Put me down! Fantastic! Release me. Is this a national sport? Get me down! How can you believe this crazy person is Asteria? She's an accomplice of the ogre. They want to imprison me as I'm the only one who can protect you from him And fortunately you are people who believe in peace. Otherwise, at least you'd drink my blood. It's just your blood that I need, dear. To do what? You saw that knight imprisoned? Well, he's the proud Gurdalak. There is only one way to bring him to life. Rub his lips with human blood boiled in water with a lizard tail and Aspidistra leaves. Why should this be my own blood? So you can free me? Free me. Free me even without blood. Don't worry, I'll only need a few drops. After, Gurdalak will lead us into battle Against "He Who Is No More." Because he is a great warrior. I can do it too. Free me and I swear it. And then he will love me. As soon as he sees me so beautiful and charming he'll fall madly in love with me Would you be willing to do that? I mean, let's talk this over. That's enough, shut up! I need your blood, not your words. No! Why the neck? I'm ticklish. And then the neck is dangerous. I might even die. This is a detail of secondary importance. No, don't let her! She's not Asteria! She wants to bleed me! Masala wouldn't allow it. If you don't shut up, you'll really regret it! You shouldn't treat guests like this! Ugly, wicked witch, leave him! I told you to leave him alone. You are committing a big mistake. I am Asteria. Cut it out! Fantaghiro would never allow for you to harm a prisoner. And then you're not Asteria, I know her well. She's not like you, ugly witch! As for "witch", fine, but "ugly"! That seems a bit too much. Get out of my way. - Where are you going? - Clear off! You. Me? Yes, you. Come here. Who are you? No one. Finally there is someone here who sees sense. - She's been transformed. - Will you take the weapons and escape. - I won't take the weapons, I swear to you. - I believe you. But you have to repay my faith. I respect my promise, okay? I won't take anything. But I'm tired of being tied and hung up everywhere. Sound the alarm, we are attacked. - Stop it you! - Stop it you! - I told you to stop! Hurry, up there. Come down, foreigner. You don't have a chance! I'll settle with you now! Only you can help Fantaghiro! She can manage very well alone. It's not our fault you were tied up. We don't know what to do. Neither do I, and it's not possible to beat the ogre. It would be useless, no one could succeed. Speak for yourself, horrid ingrate. I saved you from that witch. Is this how you thank me? You should be ashamed. You want me to get killed to thank you? And Fantaghiro? She didn't hesitate a moment to go rescue the prisoners. Yes, but she's crazy. But you fancy her a bit. Me? A woman like her? You must be crazy. She's trouble. Don't you love anyone? I can't afford to. Goodbye, little Ezela. So don't complain if no one loves you. You must never have been a child. No child can grow up to become as bad as you. Damn it when I came in this place! Okay, you win. But I know you're a little brat? Come here Nameless One Show me your bravery. This time for you it's over. That's enough, you've played too much. Nameless One come out. Or are you afraid of me? It's a shame that they've come to save you right now when you're facing such a bad end. I'm here and I'm alone. Face me coward! Come on! I'm bored fighting only against fruit and veg. Isn't there's a real man here? Can't anybody silence that hothead? You can do nothing against Fantaghiro! Fantaghiro? You said "Fantaghiro"? This is a nice surprise. I'll shut her up myself. Nameless One, it's easy to take it out on the children. And easy to conquer a peaceful people. Why not face me? Or without a name are you also without courage? Now listen! Of what should I be afraid? Let all go below deck. We'll demonstrate to this bold foreigner That "He Who Is No More" is not afraid of anyone. You are foreign, right? You're not from this world. Exactly, I'm not from here, I come from far away. Then go back there. Why want to risk your life for a people that are not yours? They don't know how to defend themselves. They need me. Presumptuous one. You really are incorrigible, Fantaghiro. You never lose that ugly habit of doing good to others You talk like you know me. Of course I know you. You're that Fantaghiro who converted to goodness Tarabas. That destroyed Darken. Who made a little lamb of the Dark Witch. Yes I know you. And I don't like you at all. Right! Come on, hit me! I won't give you the pleasure. I don't like you, but then neither do... all the forces of evil... Of the whole universe. They all know the trouble that goes with your stupid goodness. What you call goodness is only common sense... and a trust in justice. Shut up! Shut up! For me, your words don't mean anything. I don't fear you. You have made inroads in the hearts of your enemies. But me... I have no heart. Get out. I don't know what to do with you. Not even my men would like to eat you I will leave only when you have freed the prisoners. Conditions? You dare to impose conditions on me? So, if that's what you wish... Take her! And kill her! Wait a minute. I have a proposition for you. You have no heart, what about a brain? Killing me would earn you nothing. Instead, keeping me prisoner you'd have a greater force. I'd be the living symbol of your absolute power. Can't you understand? Stop it! Take her below deck. I will give you the honour of attending my meals. My mother has disappeared. I don't know what they've done. Bear up, I'll do the impossible to get you out of here. You mustn't risk it. If you're in trouble it's our fault. Now I'm one of you. Enough talking! Leave her! What do you want ? Save it for when you're screaming in boiling water. No! Mum! This is my mother's dress! Enough! - What have you done? - Shut up! - No! They've taken Fantaghiro! We are lost! Wake her, I want her woken. You must keep your eyes open. I want you to see what I am capable of. You are a monster. To satiate your hunger you commit the most horrific crimes. No. Not out of hunger. Not for so little. But what do you know? How dare you judge? You do not know me. I too... have a dream, Fantaghiro. But it's a nightmare for all the others. That's true. But it is a nightmare that will end... when I will become completely... Human. Do you see my face? It is flesh and blood like yours. And so is also... my hand. But the rest of my body... No! The rest of my body is all... like this! Are you made of wood? You are nothing but a puppet. Yes. It's true. And I was created by human beings like you. Two nations were at war for centuries. No weapon was sufficient to prevail for either of the two warring factions. - That's why they created you? - A King... and the magic of a hundred witches gave me life. I was created... from the wood of a magic tree. My body was carved from the twisted trunk of an apalicandro. And lightning from the greatest of storms has awakened... the life that is in me. I was born to be bad. But those who had created me could not have imagined just what... I would become. I did not kill only the enemies. But even those who gave me life. And I made their galleon my flying kingdom. In search of the one thing that can transform my wooden body... to a body of bone... flesh... and blood! Now you understand why I eat children? Only they can transform my... flesh... to human. And when I'm finished with this realm the metamorphosis will be complete. And I, the Nameless One, He Who Is No More will be... He... Who Is. And I'll have a name because I'll finally be, like all of you. Like you. completely... human. - You'll be missing something. - No, I'll be missing nothing. Rather you miss the point. What else will be missing when I have a body of flesh... like the rest of you? You miss what makes us love and respect life. What makes us suffer. But also feel immense joy. The spirit that's within us. The soul. The soul? And what is it? Tell me how to get it. - Don't tell him anything. - Shut up! Won't you tell me? Don't do it! I'll tell you if you free Masala and all the others. I don't believe you. I also offer my life in exchange. - It's a trick. - Absolutely not. - I don't trust you. - Wait! The soul is in my heart. Perfect, now I know how to get it. I will be enough to tear it out. No, not like that! The soul is fragile, impalpable. Only if I give it spontaneously will it remain in my heart. Otherwise it will vanish into thin air and you'll never find it again. - Are you making fun of me? - Not at all! He told the truth. Without a soul you'll not be human. And you'll never know joy and goodness. Goodness? But I don't want goodness. What do I care. I don't want your soul. Enough! Now I'll rip your heart from your chest with my very own hands! Help! Help me, I'm stuck. Help me! Help! Do something! Take her! Capture her! Mum, where are you? Too late. We ate her. Don't listen to him. You'll pay for that too. Don't let them escape. Stop them! Don't let them escape! Hurry, the chair! The table. Don't cry, please. I know it's not easy. She's dead! Next, come on. I'm not afraid of you. Give up! You can't do it alone! You're not alone! I'd never have believed I'd be so pleased to see you. The pleasure's all mine. I missed your eyes. Strange, I thought you only fought for money. I'm not doing it for free. Then there'll be no regrets. Boy, jump down. Come on, you go too. - You go first! - No, ladies first. I don't want you to sacrifice yourself for me. Not at all. But if you don't come back alive I won't be paid. Come on, jump! I thought you feared nothing! Excuse me, but there's a lady waiting for me. Here I am my brave. Finally I've made the potion to free you from the spell. Now I've became beautiful. You will fall in love with me. For you I sacrificed even my own blood. This will bring you back to life and free you from these roots. And you'll be mine forever, Gurdalak. You're alive, my love! Finally, you will love me! It took a long time for you to decide, Asteria. I wanted to wait until I was worthy of you. And you think you have succeeded? Am I still not pretty enough? You are beautiful. But your beauty doesn't interest me. I will never love you. I must follow another destiny. I cannot waste time with love. I have to become King And I will be your Queen. You have to help me defeat the Nameless One. And why should I ally myself with the weaker? Because you love me. Stand aside, woman. You don't understand that love holds no interest? Let me go to the Nameless One. Over my dead body. That won't be so difficult. Even this didn't work, and now what about me? You're still a beauty. You could try with someone else. No, he was the one I wanted. And now all this... beauty will remind me forever of all I have lost. There'll soon be a real siege here. You'd better leave first. I could stay, and so gain something more. Your greed has no limits. I'd settle for even a little. Perhaps a kiss. For you a little, but not for me. - Must you always be fighting? - We're not fighting, but courting. She's attracted to me. There's only one part of you that attracts me. You'll make me blush. The tip of your sword. Your eyes, however, say more. If you think you can conquer me you're wrong. You can... A horse? How did they get here? I waited so long for this moment. And now everything is in ruins. He'll never love me. Gurdalak. Lay down those weapons and turn around. Fantaghiro, Masala. You're back at the right time. Why are you dressed like that? I took you for an old friend of mine. It's a long history. There is no time to tell it. Gurdalak... is free from the spell. Who's he? A great leader. I so loved him. And now... he has gone. to offer his services to He Who Is Not More. Now we must arm ourselves. We saw a giant. A giant knight who fled into the forest. Quick, children, put the weapons on these sheets. We'll carry them out. Help me. Here you are. What did he want, Aries, to come and free us? Nothing. He did it for me. Didn't you really promise him anything? No. What could I promise him? Come on, two or three swords and we're done. - But what's wrong? - Nothing matters any more. Why do you say that? Because my mother... My mother is... I think... I think that... Masala, don't cry, please. I'm not crying. Has something... happened to Mummy? Is that it? Come on, tell me. No, I saw her, together with the other prisoners. You're not telling the truth. Aries and I are going to free the prisoners. I haven't accepted yet. Don't think I'll do it for nothing. You know I'm interested. I know you don't do something for nothing. But in return you'll get everything that you want. - All of it? Are you sure? - Almost everything, okay? - Why hold out your hand? - To seal the deal. Where I come from we hug. How's that? It's simple, you take the other person and squeeze her in your arms, very tight. I prefer it my way. That's fine. Nameless One, Sovereign of all sovereigns. Gurdalak, the bravest of all warriors is here for you. I have only one word. And my word is forever. If you are one of those crazies who want to save these people know that you will not escape. I want only to help myself. I was a prisoner for decades of a spell... that kept me from living. I have quickly to recover the lost time and become King And why should I care for your political career? I am only here for nutritional needs. But I know where the children are. And I can guide your men to hunt them. And what do you want in return? When you go from here I want to become King of this kingdom. I'll transform my subjects into a people of fierce warriors. What you do with these people does not concern me. The important thing is to take me right away to their children. Go! And bring me what I ask of you. And when I am well fed, all this world will be yours. Follow me! The way is clear. They didn't think we'd come back here. Great. We'll take the boats. There are three in the hut. And the other two are there. Masala and I will go and see what state they're in. Come. Don't be afraid. If the boats are alright we'll tell Asteria, take the children and weapons and then Aries and I will go to the galleon. Look. They made it! No one saw them! They've been smashed. It's not as bad as it seems. I hope. It just needs wood and some tools. I believe these will be OK. All right. Hey, here are the axes. It'll take some time but we don't have it. Look, go and get the others. - Tell them to come help us. - Alright. - Come on. All you with me. Follow me! We have to find a way to muffle the noise. It would take just a little fabric. We'll use the sleeves of our shirts. What's wrong? Afraid of catching cold? If it's for the cause... please take what you want. But this raises the price. Since I have to pay, it's better to use it all. At least we'll save our own. Embarrassed to look at me? No, why? You've never seen me like this, maybe you're not used to it. I don't have to get used to you. At the end of all this our paths will separate. You should sleep. I'll wake up when we're done. I'm not sleepy, and then we're not finished yet. We're almost done. When the boats are ready you can call the children and Asteria. - So I want you to sleep. - But I can't sleep. As soon as I close my eyes I see her asking for help. And I can't do anything. She's not there anymore. So it's true. It's really true. You said that mother is dead? I didn't say that. You're a liar! A great, big liar! My mother's no more! She's dead! No, wait, you don't understand! I screwed it up, right? Quick, tie it well! We have to be ready when they come to call. This, not that. You never know. It must be them. Here they are. Capture them! Run for it kids! Run for it! Where are you going? Do not waste time with that ugly hag. Just the children. No! No! Get off me! Be a good kid and shut up. Hear what he said? My mother is no more. She's no more. But her love will never leave you. If you want you can cry, my sweet. But I know that your mother will always be with you. How can you be so sure? Because a mother always protects her children. Even when she's not there. Even if you can't see her. She's always there, next to you. In your thoughts. But I can't see her. Can you see a thought? I've got one. Now tell me if you can see it. No, I do not see anything. Then why do you want to see her when you can't see a thought? Her love will always be with you. And will never leave you. But I can't I feel it. Because you don't know how. I'll teach you. But first... No! You have to stop crying, alright? You mustn't cry. It takes a long silence. The love that speaks softly in your heart. But if you concentrate, think only of your mother, of all the goodness that you want, then bit by bit, you'll hear it. Really. And what will I hear? Her voice. As she called you when you were playing. Or called you to the table. Or in the evening when she stroked your head to help you sleep. And I tucked in the blankets so you wouldn't get cold. And when she scolded me. Yes, she's yelling at me. Yes... Especially when she scolds you. I heard it. I can hear her. I heard it here in my head. She was so angry. Good, when you feel your loss concentrate and you'll hear her voice. As long as you hear her, she will always live, here in your heart. Come. You told her? Ssh! She's asleep. Is there much longer to go? A few minutes and then we'll try to put it in the water. But Aries, where is he? On guard. We're almost done. I'm going to call him. - No, you stay here with your sister. - All right. You were great with Ezela. I only followed your lead. And continued what you were saying. Besides, lying is my speciality. It's not true, you didn't lie. Everything you said was the truth. And it came from the heart. Will you give me a medal? Are you ashamed of having done a good deed? I don't want to get into the habit. When you always live in danger it's better not to have feelings. Why? Every time I tried to express my feelings... I lost. But not with Ezela. When I took her in my arms, I looked at you. You were moved. Why look at me? What is it? Now do you too fear how you feel. Maybe... we shouldn't be so defensive. Maybe you're right. I don't know how it'll turn out, but it seems to me an impossible victory. Let's make a pact for the few hours we have left. - We won't play any more. - All right. How do you seal a pact in your country? In this way. With a kiss. I made it up. It's not true. But maybe... maybe one day when When all this is over... I'll find the courage to tell you how I feel for you. Actually you're telling me. Help me! They've attacked us. They've attacked and taken all the children. We must fight back now. Take it! In there are all my spells. I hope the memory suckers too. Sure, why not? Come with me. We won't win the battle with magic. Look, I want you to be yourself prior to the battle. But most of all I don't want you to love me just because you've no memories of the past. No one can return to me my feelings. I cannot fight without knowing if you'd love me anyway. Where are they? Where did you put them? What do you want? They will return her memory. Do you realize... what you risk losing? It's a risk I have to run. I've got nothing out of life. I... I want to have you. But I must know if you really love me. Here they are. How long I have wanted to meet you. But why are you trembling? Is it the cold? Or is it fear? Maybe it's this place that scares you. Well, don't worry. You won't be here long. Enough! Don't be afraid. In fact, now you should smile. Now you can finally eat. I want you beautifully fat. Appetizing. Like him! This one's fine already. - Cook him for me. - I'm indigestible. Don't eat me. Now eat, you are too thin. Fantaghiro. - Fantaghiro. - Give her a bit more time. She must remake contact with all her past. And with the present, too. Aries. It seemed to me I could no longer return. How are you? I feel everything, I've found all my emotions. No, don't tell me anything. Not so soon. Still, it might not be true. Then, no matter what you say to me, I will respect it. But I have to tell you. You need to know... - Masala, Ezela. - Run from them! Hurry, hurry! Overturn the boat and take cover. Masala! Hurry, into the hut! Help! Help! Save us! Let them go! Tell them to free them! Why should I? They are my booty! They want to fry me, help! What are you doing? No! No! Don't fry me! Don't fry me! Please! No! What are you doing? Who told you I want him fried? Don't you see how plump he is? This one I'll do in the oven. And with chips. We already floured him. Dare to contradict me? That's that. So you've even got a side dish. Anyone else have something to say? You can't put me back? I'm all dirty and full of flour. With the things in the oven they don't want flour. But you know you're right? They don't know how to cook, these turnip heads. - Open your mouth. - No! Open it. I don't want to. Clean him well and then season him. SautÐ¹ slowly. I want him nice and crisp. Gurdalak won. He's sent the old one and two children. Good. Oh, no! No! I can't believe it. This is really a bad habit. Anyone who meets me ends by tying or stringing me up. Console yourself, this time you're not alone. At least you know what it feels like. Don't be so facetious, and swing towards me. - I need your mouth. - Now? Is it the right time? You can try to untie me with your teeth. They've left us here alone? Yes, at the mercy of the ants. Charming. Try to free me. Go ahead, try to swing. More slowly, calm down. Can't wait to be near me? Come on, just you move. Towards me. - Hold on. - There you go. - That's it. Yes, you're almost there. Well done. Try to keep going. What are you doing? Stop it! The knots are lower down on the other rope. - I told you to stop. - I like this game. Stop fooling they could return at any moment. I can't with my teeth, it's impossible. Let try it with hands. I'll try now. Right, here we are. - Try again. - I've missed it. - Very good. - That's it. Good, come on! We've never been so close. And might never be again if you don't stop. You're tickling my ass. I'm trying to free you, but it's not easy. You freely want me, huh? Look, I'm free. It's my turn now. Wait, I'll finish things off and then come to you. What's that noise? I want silence and concentration when I'm cooking. What do I see? He fled in vain from my ship. What have you done to my mother, you wooden puppet? What I'm doing to your friend. The clothes of Sarsut. No, my little one, don't move. Where is he? What have you done to him? What have you done? Come on, tell her what happened to your friend. Tell her what'll happen to you all. Leave my brother alone! Leave him! What fury! What energy! You're a little fury, a little devil. Want to play a bit with me? No, I won't play with you. I won't play with someone who harms mothers and children. - No! - Leave her! Escape, child. How ugly, take her! That child will be my appetizer. A little hunting before dinner stimulates the appetite. And she seems a splendid prey. Quick, untie me. This way, follow me. They're coming! They're too tight. Bite them! Rip them with your teeth. I can't, they're too hard. Come on! Alright, leave me here. I'll manage. Run to the galleon and think of the children. Together or nothing doing. Someone has to go to them. You go, I'll confront Gurdalak. They're over there. Take them! If we don't meet again, know that... Finish your sentence, tell me! I'll fight to see you again! A king doesn't fight in this way. You disappoint me. Ten against one. I am the champion of these people. If you want my respect... you must face me alone. Or are you afraid? Hold it! Hold everything. Let no one touch this man. Leave it to me, the satisfaction of killing him. Where are you? Where are you? There's no point in hiding, little beastie. Come here, you'll never escape me. Where are you hiding? So you want to play, then? I smell a nice, little girl. Where are you? Where did you get too? You're a right little demon! It's useless to run away! You'll never escape me! The smell of you will guide me. You can never win, Aries! You have no ideal! You're just a cheat wielding a sword. So speaks a two-bit leader. No! A king must fight alone. One doesn't attain power through love, blunderer. He Who Is Not More will return with your sister we'll resume our flight and will leave forever this stupid world. Can you get to all the worlds? Even that of Fantaghiro? Yes, and it's right there we'll go. But you'll never see it. We'll have eaten you first. I'll make you into broth, cooking you slowly. I don't have enough fat. I'll simmer you. I know how to make you tasty. So you'll pay for everything you did. I have a secret recipe. Just add an onion and some cloves. It'll be a slow, slow cook. I don't believe in slow cooking. - What you looking at? - The porthole. Fantaghiro is outside. There's nobody out there. Want to bet? Why not go and see? You're hallucinating. I don't see anyone. It'll take some time before he'll see me. We have to run to save Ezela. Come here, where are you going? I'll punish you like you deserve. Instead of boiled, I'll stew you. Have you finished giving orders. Hurry up, hurry up. Take care of Ezela. Looking for me? Come back here! Where are you going, coward? Come back. Where's your courage? Come back here. I'm sorry for you but victory is to the strong. I'm sorry more for you. But victory is to the smart. I'm metal! Ezela, where are you? No, don't burn it! Fantaghiro can use it to return to her world. Aries! Fantaghiro is not on the galleon. Are you sure? Yeah, she's chasing the ogre. Fetch all the boats. We've not won yet. It's best to run. Ezela, where are you? I'm coming, hold on. - Quick, in a moment all this will burn. - Yes Have you heard? It came from over there. Sarsut! I thought you'd been eaten. They forgot to light the fire. I swear I'll never drink lemonade ever again. I've never been so happy to see you again. Me too. For the first time I'm happy to see you. Ezela! The fire is lit. It'll be enough to put her to cook And she'll soon be ready. I'm not asking if you want to help. And I won't wish you bon appetit. Don't eat her, monster! I told you they made me from magic wood. Now you no longer have your sword, what will you do? Punch me on the nose? Look how generous I am. I don't want an advantage. Even if you're making me late for lunch. I'm sorry, lunch is off. Fire? Good idea! Yeah, I'm made of wood. Come! Ready? Burn me! Give me some of your heat. How many times must I tell you that I'm made from the apalicandro tree? It's an enchanted wood that doesn't burn and won't break so easily. You are stubborn and don't want to understand. And I'm tired of your stubbornness. I'll chop you into pieces so very small that no one will ever find you again. I'll turn you into dust, damn nosy parker. You strike a little too strongly, don't you think? Shut up! But now it's lunch time. Sorry to interrupt this pleasant conversation. But now I really have to go. It's a shame you want to go. It's a really good wood. Even this piece of furniture is apalicandro. Farewell Fantaghiro! If you love it so much, eat it. What's this? What have you done? Moths, but they eat even fairy wood. Goodbye, Nameless One. He who wanted to eat will end up being eaten. They're biting me! Get away, get away! Look, they are running away. Hurry, this way. Maybe we can really return home. Think how happy Fantaghiro will be when she sees you've sprouted leaves. Now she can return to her world. And you will be my surprise gift for her. I haven't told anyone that I tried to replant you. Now I just want to have fun seeing the face of Fantaghiro when I... Remember when we were in the hut and those vegetables interrupted us. You were about to say something. I wanted to say that I remembered my whole past. All my old feelings. Ah, I see. But also new ones. This means that... It means that now I'm with you. And come to love these people as my people. And little Ezela as if she were my daughter. But you must give me a little time. Time? What is time? I'll buy you all the time you want. Steal it for you. I'll do anything. At this time... I need just your smile. And maybe a kiss. Then you're really happy to stay? If you're asking me how could I not be? Ouch, what manners! So I can go and celebrate too. Didn't you say you had a gift for me? A gift? Me? I don't remember. But then don't grown-ups give gifts to children? What am I doing here? Come back, child. What am I saying? But who knows how long I'll be stuck here. What am I saying?
