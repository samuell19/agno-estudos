Did you hear that, mommy? Airplanes. Airplanes? Pt boats! Where? Off the port beam! Here we are! Tell number 14 to drop out. Pick up survivors. Survivors off the starboard bow. Tell him I got it. [Cheering] Throw them a line. Any water, mister? Yes, plenty, laddie. Periscope off starboard bow. Everybody back in the boat. Take your stations. Cast off. We'll be back for you! Man your battle stations. Stand by for depth charge attack. That sub's been stalking that lifeboat, trying to knock off a rescue ship. We'll see what we can do for him. [Boat whistle blows] [Boat whistle blows] [Buzz] Yes? Captain Bryson? Captain Bryson is not here. This is admiral Stewart. What is it? Somebody to see the commodore, sir. Lieutenant ward Stewart. Have him come in. Hello, ward. Uncle Bob, what are you doing so far from Washington? I'm here on an inspection tour. It's an unexpected pleasure seeing you here. I was supposed to go back this morning, but I'm staying till tomorrow night. I'm glad because it's given me this chance to see you. Maybe you can tell me why they sent for me. We'll come to that. First, you did a swell job sinking that submarine. It was a neat job of work all around. Tell me about it. Well, there isn't much to tell. That u-boat never had a chance. No submarine has a chance against those pt boats. You like the pt boats? It's absolutely the best branch of the service, sir. You said that about battleships. A pt's a flyweight battleship, only much more maneuverable. I recall your enthusiasm for cruisers when you were serving in them. A pt's a bantam cruiser, only easier to handle. And when you were in destroyers? A pt's a lightweight destroyer, only faster. It's a great fighting ship, sir. I understand exactly how you feel. I feel the same way about submarines and the men in them. They're picked for their character, their sense of duty and discipline, their hearts and their heads. They're a wonderful body of men. Not enough of them. There's a shortage of trained officers. Uh... About my being ordered to new London, sir. That was my suggestion, ward. How long were you in submarines? Two years. With an excellent record, as I recall. Thank you, sir. I was mighty glad to get out of them. I'm interested in your views on submarines. Well... Go ahead. Off the record, uncle Bob? Off the record. As far as I'm concerned, it's no life for a dog, even a sea dog. I'd rather sink them than sail them any day. My boy, you're going to sail them. But the pts, uncle Bob, I wouldn't be happy in any other branch. The stewarts have been in the Navy for three generations. They've been happy in any branch of the service. You think I'm tied to my desk because I prefer it? I'm serving where I'm needed most. You're being assigned where you're needed most. Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry. I'll be glad to get back to submarines. That's the spirit. Still, um... Yes? If I may say so... Go right ahead. Those pts are a work of art, sir. So are the submarines. That's right. I'll have you meet captain Bryson. He'll introduce you to your new skipper. They shipped me here so quickly, I didn't have a chance to attend to some personal business. Could I have weekend leave? Certainly. You rate some leave. I'm sure it can be arranged. [Boat whistle blows] There they go... Out to sea. Well, there they go. Yeah. We'll be going this time next week. Yes, sir, maybe. What do you mean, maybe, macdonnell? Well, we can't leave without an executive officer, can we, sir? Certainly not. We ain't got no executive officer, have we, sir? Captain Bryson promised we'd have one last week. Yes, sir. But we didn't get one last week. We didn't get one this week. We probably won't get one next week. No? We'll see about that. How are you, Dewey? Good morning, sir. You look as though you have steam to blow off. May I blow it? Go ahead. Open the valves. A whole slew of submarines just pulled out. Every day boats shove off, and we're tied to the dock. My men are getting fat, and my boat's getting barnacles, all on account of one measly replacement. You're not due to leave till next week, are you? We won't be able to leave unless we get that man. Why won't Washington unscrew that guy from his swivel chair and send him down so we can get away from that dock? You're inquiring about your new executive officer? Yes, sir. Well, here he is. Mr. Connors, meet lieutenant Stewart. How do you do, sir? I'll see you later, gentlemen. Glad to meet you, Stewart. I hope you'll overlook that swivel chair crack. Sure, sure. What was your last ship? Mosquito boat, sir. Pt-14. I certainly hated to leave it. I developed quite a yen for those fast, open boats, and, frankly, this is going to be quite a letdown. Cigarette, sir? Thanks. Annapolis, huh? Yes, sir. Class of '36. Care to have a look at the boat? Well, I came here with only a toothbrush. The admiral's let me have weekend leave so I could clear up a little personal business, if it's all right with you, sir. That's all right with me. Everybody says it will be a long war. Thank you, sir. Well, captain? Well, we've got our executive officer, Mac. That is, we will have him Monday, I hope. Oh, Mac, go back to the boat and tell Mr. brown to take over. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Aye, aye, sir. Thank you. Off you get, girls. Come on. That's it. Elbert, you take care of the luggage and see that the girls get on the train. Yes'm. I'll be right along. I thought you would miss your train. Oh, Dewey, darling, I'm so sorry I was late, but I didn't know till the last minute... What's this? Are you moving the whole school? No, just the honor students. They get the trip as a prize. Miss bromley was taking them, but she had a toothache, so I was elected. Where are you taking them, teacher? Just a few places of historic interest. How long will you be away? Several days. Several days? When you go away on your ship, it's for several weeks. Now you know how I feel. You mean to say you miss me? I mean to say. That's nice. Aboard! Come on. I wish I were an honor student, Jean, so I could come along too. You can make the next train. Can't you get away for a few days? I wish I could. Can't you get one day's leave? Now, don't tempt me. Aboard! I'll miss you an awful lot, darling. Drop me a line, will you? I'll call you. Have a nice trip. Aboard! Good-bye. Good-bye! Oh, I bought these for you! [Train whistle blows] Good night, darlings. Good night! Good night! Girls, other people are trying to sleep. Good night. Get to bed. Go on. Go to sleep. Button up. Oh! Good evening. It's a small world, isn't it? What are you doing in my berth? I was just about to ask you that same question. What are you going to do? Call the Porter and have him put you out. That's liable to create an unfortunate impression not warranted by the facts, especially as this happens to be my berth. It is not your berth. I have lower six. There seems to be a difference of opinion. It's certainly easy enough to find out. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Well, what do you know? You're right. Social error. My ticket calls for upper six. Please accept my apologies. Now will you please get out? Yes, ma'am. Anything I can do for you, miss hewlitt? No, no. Thank you very much. Oh! Would you mind taking that ladder off my foot? Oh, I'm sorry. Good night. Glad to have you aboard. [Train whistle blows] Excuse me, i left my cig... Oh, yes, of course. There it is. Thank you. I hope I haven't inconvenienced you. Good night. Oh! Oh, thank you. Good night. Good night. Good morning. This way, sir. Good morning. I hope you slept well last night. The children had me worried when I saw you rounding them up this morning. I thought you were their mother. I was relieved to find out you were only their teacher. The Porter told me. I was interested to hear these young ladies are super quiz kids, that you're taking them on a tour as a reward for being at the head of their class. The Porter mentioned it to me. Miss hewlitt, i understand you're going to Washington. The Porter. My name is ward Stewart. Washington is a madhouse there now... Standing room only. I hope for your sake you have reservations. Where are you staying? Ask the Porter. Come on, girls. [Giggling] Try the mayflower. I've got a reservation, i tell you. It expired at noon. It's only five after now. Please, sir, try the mayflower. What do you know about that? You give up everything to come here, and you can't find a place to live. Big man in Texas, ain't ya? What'll your constituents say? I'll see the postmaster general about this. I hope he mails us back. Please try the mayflower. We did try the mayflower. There's nothing over there. Try the mayflower. Try the mayflower. We've tried the mayflower. They told us to try the Carlton. I've been to every hotel in Washington. We've walked our feet off. The children are about to collapse. We don't need a suite. We'll take one room. Have you tried the mayflower? Would you get me Mr. Simmons on the desk? Couldn't you put us in the basement? The basement is filled up. Give us a tent, and we'll pitch it on the roof. I'm sorry, miss, but the roof is... [Ring] Hello. Mr. Simmons, this is lieutenant Stewart speaking. Yes, sir. I'm checking out, but on one condition. I want the young lady you're talking to to have my rooms. Don't you tell her i suggested it. I understand, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You're the luckiest woman in Washington. We've just had a cancellation. We were here first! Pardon me. Thank you, sir. Here you are. [Jean] Peggy, come out of the shower and give the other girls a chance. Anybody there? Well! Well! Really, this is too much. What do you mean by following me around? The following's with the other foot. These are my rooms! They're nothing of the sort. If you'd looked around, you'd find my baggage is still here. I had it moved to the storage room. You'll have to move it right back in again. You had no right to move my baggage out of my rooms. You checked out! I did not. I heard the clerk take the call. I'm surprised at you. That's an old trick. Everybody knows it. No accommodations, so you have one of your confederates call, check somebody out, and then you barge in. Are you accusing me of such a cheap, shabby trick? I didn't check out. I checked in, and I'm staying in. You'll have to find other quarters. Where? I don't know. C'est la guerre. Try the mayflower. Just a minute, young lady. I don't have to remind you that the armed forces have priority over civilians. Where's that telephone? What are you doing? Calling the house detective. Wait a minute, please. We're only going to be here such a short while. This is what you get for not casting your bread upon the waters. What bread? Last night, when I moved in on you by mistake, you flung me out. You wouldn't even say good night after three chances. This morning when I tried to help you, you walked out on me. I apologize. Now, captain... Lieutenant. I throw myself entirely on your generosity. For myself i could manage, but the children, poor dears, they're so exhausted. Lieutenant, surely... Well, I'll, uh... I'll have to give this some thought. I'm against appeasement as a rule, but in this case, I'm willing to discuss a negotiated peace. You keep the bedroom. I'll take the parlor. Oh, but, lieutenant, we're seven. You're only one. Since you're an officer and a gentleman... And I was a boy scout. You win. You can have the whole works. Oh, thank you so much. Under certain conditions. Oh? You know from your own experience how difficult it would be to find any place to sleep in Washington. Don't you know anybody here? I know an admiral, but you wouldn't have me inconvenience him. You might try a turkish bath. No. I'm allergic to steam. I'm afraid there's only one out for me. I'll have to stay up all night. I'm sorry. Don't think anything of it. I'm used to staying up all night. It's just that i get terribly lonesome. But we can cure that too. You'll have dinner with me... That's impossible. Why, the children, i have... The little angels can have dinner sent up here. I'll pick you up afterwards and take you on a personally conducted tour of Washington. Before you know it, it will be morning. Are you suggesting i stay up all night? No, not all of it. Just part of it. Say, till midnight. Is that agreeable? Certainly not. Very well. Would you send up a pinkerton man, please? Please don't do that. Cancel it. That isn't gold on your uniform. It's brass. There's an embassy party tonight. What time shall I pick you up? You realize this is blackmail? Make it 7:00. It's terribly crowded here, don't you think? It's nicer out here, isn't it? Divine. Who was that nice little man you introduced me to in there? What little man was that? You know. The one with glasses. Oh, his name was litvinoff. He was cute. Did you say litvinoff? Yes, litvinoff. When I tell them back home I met the Russian ambassador, they won't believe me. How do you feel? I'm having a wonderful time. You're entitled to it. You're a wonderful girl. You make up your mind very quickly, don't you? I know. I'm an expert. You might even say that I'm a connoisseur. I have an answer for that, but I can't think of it just now. The champagne... What time is it? Time stops on a night like this. Psst, Alice. Look and see what time it is, will you? Five after 3:00. Five after 3:00? And miss hewlitt isn't home yet. She said she'd be home not later than midnight. Should we worry? Something must've happened. Should we do something? We could call the police. Yeah, that's good! Let's do that! [Footsteps] Shh. How are they? Sound asleep. Bless their little hearts. What about tomorrow? Tomorrow? I mean today, tonight. Will you have dinner with me? I'm afraid not. I don't think we should see each other anymore. It'll be a crime if you don't get to know me better. Oh, an egotist. All right. It'll be a crime if I don't get to know you better. I think it'd be much better if it ends now. I'll make a deal with you. Have dinner with me tonight. If you still feel the same way you do now, I promise never to see you again. Is that a deal? It's a deal. Good night, Jean. Good night. I'll pick you up at 7:00 sharp. Miss Jean hewlitt, please. Miss hewlitt checked out, lieutenant. What? Mr. Simmons. Yes, sir? When did miss hewlitt check out? About an hour ago. She left a note for you, lieutenant. Mr. Simmons. Yes, sir? Did she leave any forwarding address? Bromley school for girls, new London. What? New London? Connecticut? Connecticut. No, it can't be. It's illogical. Things like that just don't happen. I don't understand, sir. Try the mayflower. [Whistling] Ambassadors, senators, diplomats, generals, and admirals. Everybody who is anybody in Washington was there. We had a fabulous time. We ate caviar and drank champagne and danced the whole night through. It was like a dream. A lovely dream. But why did you break your date with him the next day? Strategic retreat. Oh. To avoid encirclement, huh? It was only an episode, but for a moment, it had me worried. Jean, how about your friend, the rock of Gibraltar? Haven't you got a guilty conscience? Don't be silly. The rock's the one you marry. And after all, we're not engaged. [Whistle] [Whistle] It's a small world, isn't it? It's him. He is a dream. That's the one i didn't want walking around here. What'll I do? I'd probably break an ankle rushing downstairs. Miss hewlitt! Miss hewlitt! Oh. How did you find me? The Porter told me. Can I come up? It's against the rules. Will you come down then? No callers are permitted on the school premises, except parents. Well, I'm not a parent yet. Someday I hope to be. Please come down. It's terribly important, practically a crisis. Suppose miss bromley should see him standing there. I'll go get rid of him for you. Will you? Oh, I'd be glad to. May I borrow your lipstick, please? Never mind. I'll get rid of him myself. Well? Teacher, i brought you something. [Girls giggling] Thank you. I told you no one was allowed on these premises. You got back safely? Quite safely. How are the children? Fine, thank you. Would you mind getting down to the crisis? The crisis? Oh, yes. Yes. The last time I saw you, we made an arrangement, but you didn't keep your end of the bargain. I'm giving you another chance. Will you have dinner with me tonight? I have an appointment for dinner. You are the most beautiful... Don't say it. When you broke that date with me, you thought it'd be safer for you in new London than in Washington. Is that what you want... Safety? Yes. You present quite a problem. I can solve it for you. Really? Mm-hmm. Good-bye and good luck. Miss hewlitt, I... Oh, I don't care for any dessert, thanks. What are you dreaming about, sweet? Dewey, let's get married. Hmm? What? Let's get married. When? Tonight. I've been wanting to ask you that for weeks. Why didn't you? Well, I... Was sort of waiting to get another stripe on my sleeve. I wouldn't want you to marry anyone under the rank of a full commander. I don't want to marry a rank, Dewey. I want to marry you. It's not the rank. It takes money to get married, Jean, not the original cost, but the upkeep. I want you to have a place of your own. That's where the pay comes in. Probably we'll have brats of our own too. That's where the pay comes in again. We have to think of those things, especially now when we're at war and everything is so... Well, anyway, it's nice to know everything's snug and safe ashore. Snug and safe. Yes, it is nice to know, but I don't feel that way without you. Well, darling, maybe when we get back... Get back? Are you going to sea? Mm-hmm. We're leaving tonight. I wouldn't worry about it. It's just a little fishing trip. Chapman. Here. Hirschfield. Here. Millard. Here. Montroffsky. Montroffsky. On watch in the engine room. Williams. Here. Rutledge. On the bridge. All right, men. Fall out and gather around. Most of you have sailed on the corsair before, but to the new men aboard, I have only this to say. Since Pearl harbor, this ship has always returned from a cruise with a broom at the masthead... A clean sweep. We'll do it again. Make preparations to get underway immediately. Aye, aye, sir. Station the sea detail. First section has the watch. First section, sea detail. All set, Mr. Stewart? Yes, sir. Take her out. Aye, aye, sir. Take in two and three. Take in two and three. Take in four. Take in four. Take in one. Take in one. Starboard back 2/3. Port back 1/3. Starboard back 2/3. Port back 1/3. Rudder amidships. Rudder amidships. Hey, chief, how about a little relief? I've been on for six hours. That's right. Okay, Mr. brown? Okay. Oh, pat, come on. Take the manifold. Aft torpedo room. Aft torpedo room. Aft torpedo room. Aye, aye. Send Rutledge to control room to relieve Jo... To relieve Johnson on the bow planes. Aye, aye, sir. Sure is close quarters, chief. What's wrong, chief? Why... Why, nothing. A little attack of indigestion, I guess. I'll be all right. Leave me alone. I'm all right. How about a cup of coffee, chief? No, I don't want any java, thanks. Hey, you asleep, doc? Huh? Oh, hello, Oliver. You're a pharmacist's mate. What do they put Nitroglycerin in pills for? Nitroglycerin? That's what they give to people whose hearts are on the blink. Something wrong with your ticker? No, I'm all right. I'm just inquiring for a friend. I'd tell him to see a doctor before he took any of those. Yeah. What is our depth, brownie? 75 feet, sir. Bring up to periscope depth. I want to have a look. Aye, aye, sir. 40 feet. Get that problem solved, brownie? Yeah. It was a Lane 100 miles long and 14 miles wide. 30 days to patrol a Lane 14 miles wide and 100 miles long. With one of those torpedo boats, I could've patrolled the whole north Atlantic in half that time. Those new pts have everything on them but a waffle iron. Look. Mr. Stewart. Yes, sir. Come take a look. If you were on a pt boat with a waffle iron, what would you say that was? It's a freighter, sir. Right rudder. New course 2-5-0. Right rudder. New course 2-5-0, sir. That's a Swedish flag. Seems to be in distress. The men are working on something aft. They might be shifting cargo. They might be laying mines. We'll have a look. Down periscope. Stations for battle surface. All ahead 2/3. Stations for battle surface. Stations for battle surface! [Alarm clanging] Battle surface. Take her up. Hard right. Blow one, two, and five. [Alarm clanging] Show them our colors. Amerikaner. Oh. Tell them to stand by for boarding and inspection of ship's papers. Was wollen sie? Sie wollen an bord. Wunderbar. Lass sie nur kommen. Zu befehl, herr kapitan. Prepare to board her, Mr. Stewart. Aye, aye, sir. Sorry we haven't got a pt boat to send you over in, but... Get this boat back to the sub as quick as you can. Commence firing! Tell them to... Achtung! Achtung! Achtung! Feuer! Feuer! Feuer! That q-boat's got us outgunned. Don't you think we ought to dive, sir? Not till those guys get back here. Come on! Take her down, captain! Crash dive her! We'll take our chances. Come on! Cease firing. Secure all guns. Stand by to dive. Feuer! It's a cinch they'll start dropping ash cans now. How much water under us, brownie? 15 fathoms, sir. Pump to auxiliary from sea. Pump to auxiliary from sea. We're taking her to the bottom. Feuer einstellen! Feuer einstellen. Volldampf voraus. Scharf backbord. Volldampf voraus. Scharf backbord. Brace yourselves. We're going to hit. Achtung! Achtung! Feuer! Feuer! All right, boys. Take it easy. Smoking lamp is lit for 10 minutes. Pass the word. All hands, smoking lamp is lit. 10 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Stewart. [Explosion] You better go forward and see how the men are, Mr. Stewart. Yes, sir. Feuer! Everything quiet and serene forward, sir. Very well. Aft torpedo room reports flooding, sir. Take it, Mac. Aye, aye, sir. Stand by. Secure the watertight doors. Should I sound the crash alarm? And let that q-boat hear us? Belay it. Turn on your high pressure pump. Break out the corking tools. Emergency shores. Stand by air salvage. Turn on the emergency light. Hurry up, will you? If only I were up there in one of those pt boats. Well, you're not, Mr. Stewart. Oh, Mr. Stewart. Go forward and tell them to take the torpedoes out of one and two. Out? I said out. Aye, aye, sir. Brownie, break out about 10 life jackets and bring them forward on the double. I don't get it. What's the skipper taking the fish out for? Tell Oliver to rustle up all the empty packing cases and debris he can find. Men, strip off your clothes down to your skivvies. Captain, would you tell me... When you can't get away, Mr. Stewart, you play possum. [Explosion] Are they ready? Yes, sir. Give me those caps. Here they are, sir. Fill up the impulse air pressure. Aye, sir. All right. Open number one, Mr. Stewart. Aye, aye, sir. Engine room. Engine room. Aye, aye. Stand by to pump 100 gallons of fuel overboard. Open the outer doors. Stand by, Mr. Stewart. Yes, sir. Engine room, outer doors open, sir. Pump the oil overboard. You all set? One set, sir. Fire one. Secure the outer doors. Come along, Mr. Stewart. Captain's hit his head. Get the pharmacist's mate. Help get the captain to his cabin. Control room. Control room. Pharmacist's mate. The captain's quarters. Was ist das? [Speaking german] Ol. Ol. Wunderbar. Where's that q-boat? Bearing 5-0, sir. Can you give me an estimate on her speed? 5 knots, sir. It looks like the skipper fooled them. They won't drop any more ashcans. Now's the time to get away. Now's the time to get, period. How much water do we need to put her on the bottom? 4,000 pounds. Pump from auxiliary to sea. How are the bilges aft? Torpedo room practically dry, sir. Put those fish back in one and two. When she breaks loose, bring her up easily. 3,000 out. Secure at 5,000. Secure at 5,000, sir. Now we're loose. Remember, bring her up easy. Aye, sir. 80. All ahead 1/3. Give me a bearing. Where is she? Bearing 5-2, sir. Motor room answers all ahead 1/3, sir. Right full rudder. Right full rudder. New course 2-9-0. Can you level her off and hold her at 40 feet? Aye, sir. Q-boat slowing down, sir. Coming up fast. More dive on the bow planes. More dive on the bow planes. Up periscope. Steady as you go. Steady as you go, sir. Are all torpedo tubes ready for firing? Three and four ready, sir. Mark. Enemy bearing 0-0-3. Angle on the bow... 84. One and two ready, sir. They stopped, brownie. Enemy speed zero. Watch your depth, Stevie. Watch your depth. Range 1,200. Firing order, one and two. Firing order, one and two. You're right on it, sir. Stand by, one. Stand by, one. Fire one. Fire one. One fired, sir. Well, babies, you're on your way. [Spits] Do your stuff now. Stand by, two. Stand by, two. Fire two. Fire two. Two fired, sir. Bring her up, Stevie. Blow one, two, and five. Little chilly, but a beautiful evening. Lovely. I'm off watch, but I hate to think about going below. Mac, tell Oliver to bring me up a cup of coffee. Tell him to make it two. Aye, sir. Nice work for all of us. Beautiful evening. Yes, it is. It's usually like that in these latitudes. How do you feel, captain? Oh, fine. I want to congratulate you on the way you got that q-boat. Well, he'd have got us if we hadn't played possum. You know, I'm thinking someday they'll make a torpedo boat that'll submerge. That's funny you should mention that, captain. I've been thinking of a way to make a submarine go 50 knots. Ha ha ha! Here. Cigarette? Thanks, Dewey. You're welcome, ward. Let's go below and have a smoke. Hello, Dewey! [Chatter] How are ya? Good to see you. Gee, it's nice to see you back. Where'd you get that broom? Don't tell them. Make 'em guess. It sure feels good to see the sun after 60 days. Get me the officers club. You come back from one of these cruises looking like you were born in a pool room. But you head for these lights, and it's like you're just back from palm beach. On pt boats, you don't need sun lamps. Pipe down about those pts for a while. Here you are, sir. Thank you. Give me the dining room, please. Yes, on those pts, you get the real article all day long... Sun and wind and spray... This is lieutenant commander Connors speaking. We're just back from a cruise. We're coming over for lunch. There'll be two of us. No. No meats, no steaks, no chops. We want vegetables. Fresh vegetables. Fresh vegetables. All you've got. And milk. Not out of cans. Not out of cans. And fruit. Plenty of fresh fruit. Watermelon. And above all, butter. Fresh butter, and all they've got. All you've got. Right. Ah, fresh celery. Oh, fresh celery. Hello, Lee. How are you? Fine, sir. You get our order? Yes, sir. Coming right up, sir. Excuse me, ward. I got to make a phone call. Oh, fresh butter. When have i seen you before? Just an appetizer, sir. Just an appetizer, hmm? Hello, bromley school? Could you get a message to miss Jean hewlitt when she's through with class? Ask her to call commander Connors at the officers club at the sub base. That's right. Thank you. Say, you following me around? No, sir. I'm just walking with you. Well, walk up where I can see you. Okay. Wherever I am, you are. I got a feeling you're spying on me. What is this? I don't know, chief. I guess it's what you might call coincidence. You know, captain, this is Michigan celery. Oh, Mac. Macdonnell, just a minute. Excuse me, ward. Captain. Got some good news for you. News, sir? I saw some papers on the captain's desk. What papers? I don't know who, but somebody recommended you for promotion to warrant. Oh. Well, that's wonderful of you, captain. You'll pass your physical, and it's in the bag. Yes, sir. Thanks a million, captain. So, uh... You're going to make us salute, huh, chief? Is that it, Lee? Yes, sir. Ohh... Oh, boy. Is that good! And milk. Let's have some. Fill 'em up. I'm going to spoil that beautiful arrangement. Dive in, ward, before it's gone. Just a minute. There you are. You can't get milk like that from a sea cow. Ahh... ambrosia. Fill it up again. Nectar. Make it two. Better get another pitcher, Lee. Yes, sir. And watermelon? Yes, sir. Mr. Connors? Telephone, sir. Oh, boy. That's the call I've been waiting for. Excuse me, ward. Hello, darling. I love you. I love you. I appreciate that, Dewey. Thanks very much. Oh, captain Bryson. I'm terribly sorry, sir. I was expecting another call. So I gathered. Dewey, how soon can you leave for Washington? Washington? Don't tell me they're going to transfer me. Don't worry about that. The department wants you to make a personal report and properly express their appreciation. When can you leave? On the next plane, sir, I suppose. Very well. I'll be right over. Chief. Chief macdonnell. What do you want? Well, I was delivering the captain's laundry. Yours was ready, so I brought it up. Who told you to come? Nobody. It was ready, so I brought it. All right. Put it over there. Well, how'd you come out on your physical? What physical? For your promotion to warrant officer. I decided to turn it down. Turn it down? Sure. What do I want with it? More work, more grief. I'm satisfied where I am. I don't want any promotion. Maybe you'd rather have a pension. What do you mean, pension? Mac, it's none of my business, and it certainly isn't up to me to give you advice, but... If I had a weak heart... What are you talking about? A man don't take Nitroglycerin for dandruff. Who told you? I saw you get the fit on the ship. I saw you take the little pill. It's no disgrace to get sick. Maybe if you told a doctor, he could fix you up... And put me on the beach for the rest of my life. No, thanks. I'm satisfied now. I don't want any promotion. I don't want any pension. I know what I want. If you say anything, you sneaking stool pigeon... Sit down, Oliver. I'm sorry. I can't understand how you got by on your last physical. Oh, I didn't have my first attack until a couple months ago. I saw a civilian doctor. There'll be a routine checkup in three months. But there'll be one more cruise before then. You'll understand when I tell you something, something I've never told anybody else. It was in the last war... My first tour of duty in a submarine, and I wasn't sick. I was pretending. So they left me ashore. Was you afraid? Ship never came back. She was sunk in action. All the crew was lost. All except me. I was safe ashore. Now do you see? Yeah. I see. So you'll... Keep your trap shut, won't you? Don't worry about me. The way I see it, nobody consults nobody when he's born, so they ought to give him a little leeway when he's... I-i... I mean, if he's... Thanks, mate. See you around, Mac. Girls, I'll tell you once again... Pull the string back with your three forefingers, trying to rest your thumb against the... Feet 15 inches apart and your bodies facing me squarely. All right. Ready... Aim... Fire. That was all right. Let's try it once again. Shall we? And try to remember your form. All right. Aim... Fire! Oh, many a shaft at random spent finds marks the Archer never meant. [Giggling] Girls, you can relax just a moment. I told you to stay away. Many a word at random spoken can soothe or wound a heart that's broken. Please leave. Sir Walter Scott. Do you want me to lose my job? I have a suggestion. You want to get rid of me? Most decidedly. Then have dinner with me... just once. I'll never see you again unless you insist. What do you say? No. Is that final? Yes. Who's this coming along here? Could it be miss bromley? She wouldn't want to find me here. What about tonight? I've never met a more unscrupulous man with less principle. What time should i pick you up and where? 7:00. Outside the school. Hello, miss bromley. Taking your afternoon constitutional? Attention, girls. We'll try it once again. # Don't sit under the apple tree # # with anyone else but me # # anyone else but me # # anyone else but me # # no, no, no # # don't sit under... # Would you mind telling me, after riding for three hours, where we're going? The best restaurant in the state. Yes, but what state? Massachusetts. I'd rather eat in Connecticut. We've already crossed the state line. We're almost there. What sort of place are you taking me to? A roadhouse. Is this it? Mm-hmm. You're sure this is the place? It certainly is. I've been here dozens of times. You'll love not only the food, but the atmosphere... The privacy. We have to ring the bell to get in? Of course. It's very exclusive. Mr. ward! Good evening, sir. Good evening. So glad to see you. I suppose you're looking for... Reservations. Yes. I hope they're taken care of. Reservations, sir? How's business? Business, sir? Last time, you were jammed. The war, I suppose. Can't expect business as usual. Yes, sir. Would you like a drink or go to the bar? Miss hewlitt, i can explain. I don't think so. You mentioned several times this is a small world. I never agreed with you until now. You're right. It is small. Too small for both of us. Just a minute... Hi, stinky! Hello, butch! Come up here, you old sea dog. Give us a kiss. Hello. How are you? No, no, mother. You don't know her. Oh, a new one. Yes. Scoundrel. Why didn't you write? The north Atlantic has no letter boxes. I thought of you. That's why I'm here. You're a liar. You're here for some ulterior motive. Probably grub. Grandmother, may I present miss hewlitt? Hello. How do you do? Where'd you get this one? You were saying something about some grub. I'll go have a talk with the cook. He can pick 'em. I beg your pardon? You play gin rummy? Well, I just learned... A pigeon. Come along. Henry, dry Martinis. This way to the slaughterhouse. [Laughter] Yes, he was very funny as a kid. There's been a big change since then. Ah. Midshipman. It took all our influence to keep him from being thrown out of the academy. I graduated with honors. I was among the first six. There was always something very queer about that. He couldn't possibly be as bad as you say... Or as good as you say. That was taken the first day of school. I suggested reform school. They wouldn't take my advice. Aw, look at that. A demon. An imp of Satan if ever there was one. If you don't believe me, look at that. How adorable! No, no. That's all for tonight. What a guy. I'll never forget his first time in Europe. There was a girl... Miss hewlitt is not interested in your aimless meandering. Besides, it's way past your bedtime. I get you, Steve. Good night. Good night. You're okay. The McCoy. I approve of her entirely. Come on, butch. Go to bed. Oh, stinky... All right. Give us a kiss. Hewlitt, watch out for him. He'll charm the shirt off your back. I know. I haven't got a shirt left. How do you like that? Gin rummy before dinner, and she's monopolized your whole evening with that album. I think she's wonderful. So sweet. Well, in her palmy days, they do say... She had three husbands that we know of. Would you like more coffee? No, thanks. It's getting awfully late. Oh, no, no. Sit down. We haven't been alone all evening. I've got to talk to you. I think... Please. Sit down. Have a cigarette. No, thanks. Wait... Where'd you get this picture? Clipped it from the newspaper. That uso party the other night. I'm starting a new album. Now, just relax. If I get out of line, you can scream. Butch will charge down. Of course, she's a little deaf. I can scream loud enough. Yes, I'm sure of that. I think it's time that we came to an understanding. Just what do we mean to each other? I'll be quite honest. When you bumped into me in my berth... In my berth. Okay, your berth. I thought you were very stunning. Yes, that's it. And I was stunned by you. Of course, my, uh, intentions at that time... You don't need to go any further. Thank you. When I was away on that cruise, I thought of you a lot. Even under the sea i thought of you. And on the surface? I thought how nice it would be if this girl, this awfully swell girl and I could, uh... Could be friends. That's all I ask, Jean. Will you give me your hand on it? If I do, how do I know you won't throw me over your shoulder? I promise not to. My friend, it's time i take you home. Thank you... My friend. Good morning. Good morning. Here you are at home, safe and sound. Are, um... Are you wide awake? Yes. Then listen. We've been friends long enough. It's time we adjusted our relationship. We've either got to be less than friends or more than friends. Jean... Do you know what this is? It's your class ring. Mm-hmm. Do you know what it means if I put this on your finger? Yes. Hello, miss bromley. Taking your morning constitutional? Ah, it's a lovely day. Loveliest day of my life. Taxi? Well, this is what i call service. Do my eyes deceive me, or is that another stripe? Congratulations. So that's why they sent for you in such a hurry. Just a mere detail. They really wanted the dope on our run-in with that mine-laying q-boat. They're pretty concerned. They figure they must have a secret base somewhere. Remember where that was? Do I? I was in the rubber boat. Well, we're going out that way again. We're leaving tonight. Let's get going. Where to, commander? Let's go to my quarters and split a bottle. Yes, it was right around there someplace. Yeah. That's the area we've had our greatest shipping losses. The only clue is that q-boat we sunk. It must have come from the u-boat base. Our job's to locate it and, if possible, destroy it. If possible? It's not as easy as you think, ward. It's like a needle in a haystack... Pretty tough assignment. That's why they gave it to our best submarine skipper. Pipe down. Help yourself to milk, boy. I'm practically awash now. Better store away plenty of it, ward. It's going to be a long cruise. Nice quarters you have here, Dewey. Better than my diggings. Well, it's for rent. Really? Are you kidding? No. After this cruise, I'll be looking for a house. A house? Yeah. You know that new stripe on my sleeve, ward? That's more than a stripe. That's the marriage license. Well, you old granite-puss. You certainly can serve in silence. Congratulations. When does it happen? This afternoon... I hope. That's her. Beautiful, isn't she? Swell gal, too. She's waiting at the officers club now. Say, wouldn't you like... I'd like to, Dewey, but there's some things I've got to do. Okay, ward. I'll see you later. Is Jean hewlitt here? She's right over there, sir. Ward, what are you... Would you come out on the veranda? Certainly. You make your own rules, don't you? What? About stringing a man along. In fact, two men. I just left Dewey Connors. Why didn't you tell me? In the beginning... I didn't think it mattered. And in the end, it mattered too much. I thought it best to tell him first. And what about me? I did everything I could to discourage you. I didn't want to continue seeing you. You know that. I certainly didn't want to fall in love with you. But I did. Dewey's coming here to ask you to marry him. And I'm waiting here to tell him I can't. You mustn't, Jean. What would you advise me to do? I'd... Advise you to forget everything I told you last night. It all comes under the heading of... Practice. Yes. That's it. You made it sound very convincing, a whole lot more convincing than what you're saying now. Oh, wong, have you seen miss Jean hewlitt? She's on the veranda with Mr. Stewart. With who? Lieutenant Stewart, sir. Well, thank you, wong. I'm very fond of Dewey Connors, but i can't marry him because i don't love him. I'm in love with you. If you hadn't come along, maybe I'd have married Dewey, but you did come along. We've got to be honest with him. We've got to tell him. That won't be necessary. D-Dewey, I... Captain. What is it, Mr. Stewart? Before we clear the channel, there's something else I'd like to clear. I'm not interested. All right. Forget about me. But you're not being quite fair to her. Personal affairs and feelings have no place here. When we get ashore, I'll be glad to take it up with you... Any way you like. Very well, sir. That inlet's just like the last and all the others... Absolutely nothing. Well, we better find that secret base pretty soon. Their subs are doing a lot of damage to our ships. Besides, we got just about enough fuel oil left to get back to new London. Well, it's about time. What am I, a stepchild? I'm sorry, chief. Cream? You know i never take cream in coffee. I know, but I thought maybe just for a change... Mr. Stewart, ship bearing 2-8. All ahead 2/3. Get all tubes ready for firing. Forward torpedo room. Get all tubes ready for firing. Aft torpedo room. Get all tubes ready for firing. Motor room answers all ahead 2/3. What's going on? Why wasn't I called? Tanker, sir. I'm getting all tubes ready for firing. Belay that order. We won't sink that ship. Our ships aren't in this area. That's an enemy craft. That's why I'm not sinking her now. We've got to. We'll lose her in the dark. Belay the orders, Mr. Stewart. Aye, aye, sir. Secure all tubes. Secure all tubes. Captain, what are your plans, sir? If that's an enemy ship, it's operating from an enemy base. Ever play follow the leader? When they open those submarine nets to let that tanker by, they'll be letting us through too. What about the mines? The harbor's probably full of them. I know, but if we stay close to the propellers of that tanker, we've got an excellent chance of getting through without getting blown up. Coming up slowly. Speed 2 knots. Speed 2 knots, sir. Change lights for night vision. Aye, aye, sir. Gee, chief, i can't get used to these red lights. That's because you never get out of this hull. Awful lot of help, though, when you have to see in the dark. Forward torpedo room. Aye, aye. Stand by. Ready to go through minefield. Aft torpedo room. Aye, aye. Stand by. Ready to go through minefield. Boy, I wonder what would happen if we ever hit one of those mines. I don't know, but here's that five bucks I owe you. [Scraping] Mine cable. All right, Mr. Stewart, let's get on with our course. Holy mackerel. Look at those shore installations... And that harbor jammed with shipping. Boy, that looks like a grand slam. All stop. All stop, sir. We're in. Have all deck force not on watch muster in the control room immediately. Put her on the bottom. All auxiliaries proceed through manifold. Control room reports all stop, sir. Auxiliary flooding slowly, sir. Herr leutnant. Wieviel ol haben wir bis jetzt behommen? Ewoelfhundert liter, herr kapitan. Well, men, this is the place we've been looking for. This is the base they've been operating from. Now, here's our plan. A landing party will go ashore to demolish the base. We'll surface just enough to let you men off. Now, when you blow up the ammunition dumps, that will be my signal to attack the shipping in the harbor. We'll be operating on a split-second schedule. Exactly 30 minutes later, the corsair will be standing by to take aboard those of the landing party who can get back. 30 minutes isn't much. Make every minute count. Mr. Stewart will be in charge of the landing party. I'm not going to ask for volunteers. I'm going to ask only the unmarried men to raise their hands. Take over, Mr. Stewart. Aye, aye, sir. Come forward, men. Oh, boy. Get the back of your neck too. Ha ha ha ha! What's so funny? I'm the only born commando here. Mac, take charge of the machine guns and all the demolition material. Oliver will help. Curly, you and Hammond rig the rubber boat. What are we going to do, sir? Give the Germans a minstrel show? Grab them Tommy guns and give them a final check. Are you ready? Two or three minutes, sir. I'd like to talk with you. Well? You know what our chances are of getting back. Yes. Then you can believe that what I'm going to say is true. It doesn't matter what you think of me, but don't feel bitterness toward Jean. She played square with both of us. I didn't know what she meant to you. If I had, I... Well, all that matters now is that you believe what I'm telling you is true. So long, Dewey. Good luck. [Dewey] Ease her up, brownie. Come on, men. 70. 60. 40. 20. Open the hatch. Remember, 30 minutes. Aye, aye, sir. Take her down, brownie. What's it look like, Mr. Stewart? If they don't see us before we get there, we stand a pretty good chance. From now on, we're on our own. Rizzie, we'll take the oil tank. When that goes, it will be a signal to blow up the rest. Mac, take the ammunition dump. Take one man with you. Aye, aye, sir. Let's see... Hey. Okay, Oliver, let's go. Hammond, you take the gasoline drums. Take these two men and Johnson with you. Aye, aye, sir. That's it. Give me the tape. Time them. Well, what is it? It takes them about 70 seconds to make the rounds, sir. I can make it. Cover me. [Ticking] Halt! Fire one. Fire two. Keep her down. Stand by. Fire five. Fire six. Drop your guns. Mac, get these men back to the boat. Aye, aye, sir. Get back to the boat. You've only got five minutes. What about... Get going! What are you doing here? I don't like crowds, sir. No more ammunition, sir. Come on. Let's go. That was the chief, sir. Macdonnell, come on! Okay, Mr. Stewart, I'm coming! Mac! Go ahead. I'll be right with you. Where's macdonnell? Can you swim underwater? No, but I'm learning right now. Where's Mr. Stewart? On shore with Mac and Oliver. We can't wait. Stand by to dive. Aye, aye, sir. There they are, sir. Hold it, brownie! Give them a hand. Where's macdonnell? We won't have to wait for him, sir. Everybody below! Get set, brownie. We're going down. The eyes are gone. We'll have to stay on the surface. We're dead fish if we do. Let's go below. Prepare to dive her, brownie. Brownie, don't dive her. The captain's up on the bridge. Tell Mr. Stewart to take her down to 30 feet. I'll be your periscope till we get out of the harbor. I'm not going to dive her while you're up... [Dewey] Take her down 30 feet. That's an order, Mr. Stewart. Aye, aye, sir. Take her down to 30 feet and level off. 30 feet. 30 feet. Hold her there. Aye, aye, sir. Are you all right, captain? I'm all right. Steady as you go. Steady as you go. 1-7-0, sir. We're on 1-7-0, captain. Are three and four ready for firing? Three and four ready? Ready, sir. Ready, captain. Come right to 1-9-5. Come right to 1-9-5. On the course, sir. On the course, captain. [Dewey] Stand by. Stand by. Stand by. Fire three. Fire three. Fire three. Three fired, sir. Well, what about four, captain? You can save it. They won't need it. Come back to 1-7-0. Come back to 1-7-0. Back to 1-7-0. On the course, sir. On course, captain. You're wet. Slip this on. Thanks, brownie. All ahead full. All ahead full. All ahead full. Motor room reports all ahead full. [Dewey] We're heading for the net. Brace yourself. We're going to crash the net. Stand by. We're crashing the net. We've cleared the net, and we're on our way. Pretty wet up here. Bring me up a few feet. Hold her at 25 feet. 25 feet. We're hit topside. Captain! Captain! Blow safety! Get us up fast! Come on, brownie. Riley, follette, come topside. Come on, men. Bear a hand. Get him up in a sitting position. Easy does it. Get the first-aid kit. Give me a lift. I've got him. What is it, Jack? It's only a flesh wound, sir, but it's pretty deep. Hey, anybody got a cigarette? Here you are, captain. You'd better paste that back in, ward. Gonna lose it. [Cheering] Well, don't stand there like an undertaker. Open the door. [Laughing] Hey! Easy with the rice. They're liable to ration that soon. Congratulations, my boy. Thank you. I told you. Serves you right. Oh, butch. Congratulations, stinky. You don't deserve her. Uncle Bob, i want you to know my new executive officer. Here, here. Look out. He's another of them. They're all wolves in this family. Uh, just a minute. Oh, stinky, leave the poor girl alone. I want to know how he sold you this bill of goods. Well, you're back not only with a broom at the masthead, but with a bride. I'm certainly glad you ordered me to new London. I take it you're now a confirmed submarine man. Well, sir, yes and no. You'd rather go back to the pt boats? Well, uh, no and yes. Can't you chart a little more definite course? I think so, sir. The pt boats are swell. They do a grand job, and they'll play their part in winning the war, but not without the submarines. They've got their job to do in all the seven seas, and, boy, how they're doing it. And the carriers that bring the planes that drop the bombs that sink the enemy ships. And the cruisers that protect the airplane carriers. And the battleships... The dreadnoughts and super dreadnoughts... The big shots of the fleet. They're in there punching too. They're all in there doing their job, working together. I found that out, sir. It isn't one branch of the service. It's all branches. And it isn't all ships. It's men. The men behind the guns of the pt boats, the submarines, and coast guard ships, the mine layers and tenders, the tankers and the troop ships. The men that take them out, that fight their way over and land them there. That's the Navy... The United States Navy.
