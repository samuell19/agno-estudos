[man] You're out of chances, Kaem. Sutthiphong died almost a month ago. You're still doing less than half the work he did. Yes, boss. Well... As far as I'm concerned, no one could finish this job on time. Doing the annual budget summary in less than a month? Besides, it's not part of her job. All right. If you can finish it before January 2nd, we'll promote you as a replacement for Sutthiphong. What about... What are their names? Our interns. [woman] Jack and Phraeo? Yeah, whatever. Tell them to help her. Thank you, boss. Okay. Anyway, Happy New Year. [suspenseful music playing] [unavailable signal] Where the hell is he? [clanking] Get that thing out of the way. [sighs] [dialing phone] [line ringing] [hangs up] [door beeping] I'm so sorry, Miss Kaem. Miss Kaem? Well... Please don't tell my boss about this. If you file another complaint, I'll probably get fired. Please. Is that all you can think of? You're working so late. Aren't you afraid? [mysterious music playing] Afraid of what? Mr. Sutthiphong. He sat next to you and died from being overworked. If I were you, I'd sit somewhere else. Wait. Lamduan didn't come into work the other day. She said it was because she saw Mr. Sutthiphong in a Santa Claus suit sitting next to your desk. [elevator dings] I'm not surprised you're just a security guard. [eerie music playing] Phraeo. How's work? [Phraeo] Well, I... I tried to contact Miss Fon, but she didn't answer the phone. [sighs] You have to get in touch with her at any cost. Oh! If you don't, you can find yourself a new internship. [slow music playing] SUTTHIPHONG THARAB MANAGING DIRECTOR [typing] [wind rushing] [sighs softly] [continues typing] [man] Why did you want me dead? [intense music plays] [man] Why did you want me dead? [Kaem screaming] [breathing heavily] [door opening] Are you okay? Yeah. What do you want? May I go out to get some coffee? Who with? Alone. Get me a large nonfat cappuccino. What are you waiting for? I don't have enough money. Your coffee is almost six dollars. I don't want it anymore. Hurry back. Yes, ma'am. [sighs] [intense music playing] [slow music playing] [phone dings] MOM - ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T BE COMING HOME? I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO. [mysterious music playing] I PROMISE I'LL GET OUR HOUSE BACK IN THE NEW YEAR WITH MY BIG BONUS. [mysterious music playing] Why are you so moody today? Jack. You startled me. Give me a smile. How can I smile? Work is so stressful. If I can't finish this project, I'll be in big trouble. Don't worry. I know you can do it. Get back to work. Phraeo might see us. Give me a smile first. -Please. -No. [chuckles softly] Happy? You're so cute. Go. Jack! [water running] [sighs] [intense music playing] [eerie music playing] [woman screams in distance] What was that? I'll go check. [thrilling music playing] [banging] Jack? [eerie music playing] Where's my cell phone? [party MC] Now, let me tell you about the festive atmosphere over here. The place is crowded. I have to speak very loudly because it's just so noisy here. I have to shout just to be heard. There's barely any place to stand. There are locals and tourists here, so many people, and everyone is excited. The countdown is going to start in just a few minutes... [MC continues, indistinct] [eerie music playing] -[intense music plays] -[gasps] I'm sorry, Miss Kaem. You scared the hell out of me. Miss Kaem, did you need something? Right. Have you seen Jack? Jack? Jack? Jack? Jack, the intern. I haven't seen anyone. What do you mean? Well, I've been sitting here and haven't seen anyone come down. What about Phraeo, the female intern? No. If she came down, she couldn't have left the building anyway because I have the keys and the keycard. [sighs] THIEF [eerie music playing] [Kaem gasps] [elevator door closing] [thuds] [elevator door closing] [thuds] [elevator door closing] [thuds] [eerie music playing] [sighs] What are you doing, Jack?

[screams] [intense music playing] [screaming] [screaming] [Kaem crying] [sighs] Phraeo, you can come out now. [panting] Thank you, Jack. Let's finish off the slut. What do you want from me? "If you can't get in touch with Miss Fon, find yourself a new internship." Fuck you! You killed our father! [intense music plays] I didn't kill him. You know, Phraeo, I'd only been working here for four days, and she had sex with me in the bathroom. Fucking slut. You know, Kaem, we used to spend New Year's Eve with our father. After you intervened, my life was ruined. You had an affair with him. You used him and worked him to death. You seduced him and pressured him to break up with my mother. How could you do that? [yelling] Didn't your parents ever teach you not to steal someone's husband? -[intense music playing] -Father? Are you siblings? Yeah. [crying] Jack... Jack... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please don't kill me. I'm begging you. Please. Please don't kill me. [Kaem crying] [Kaem shuddering] [Kaem sobs] [Jack shushes] Give me a smile. [sobbing] [grunts] [Jack] Let's send her to hell. [crying] [Kaem sobs] It's five minutes to midnight. Do it.

[sobbing] [Kaem sobbing] [beeps] [beeps] [Kaem crying] [sobs] [beeps] [beeps] [door creaking] [elevator dings] [MC] All right, let's start the countdown! -Ten! -Somebody help me! -Nine! -Help! -Eight! Seven! -Help me! -Six! Five! -Help! -Four! Three! -Help me! -Two! One! -Help me! -[shouting] Help! -Happy New Year! Happy New Year, everyone! [ax slicing] [eerie music playing] [intense music plays] [man] Welcome back to the show! Our next story is a horror story about a movie theater. Are you curious now? Let's talk to Miss Phraeo. -This is her story. Hello, Phraeo. -[Phraeo] Hi, Puk. [Puk] All right, Phraeo, please tell us your story. [Phraeo] Okay. First, let me tell you that, before it became a movie theater, the building used to be a Hindu temple. It was later made into a movie theater. So it seems to have some demonic powers. It originally had five theaters, which they cut down to four. But the fifth one still shows films all day and night without an audience. [eerie music playing] [knife slashing] [Puk] Has anyone ever taken a peek or snuck into this fifth theater? Is there someone or something inside? [Phraeo chuckles] No one dares. The staff unanimously decided that we shouldn't go in there, so it's strictly prohibited, or else... [tsks] [girl] Hey! [Phraeo] Nun, stop it. Stop kidding around. You're so lame. Hey! Hey! Come out. Nun? [eerie music playing] Phraeo. Working a night shift alone? Yes. My friend asked me to switch shifts with her. She's scared of ghosts, so-- Nonsense. There are no ghosts here. I'm okay though. I can work the night shift. I'm not superstitious. It's not an issue. You should go home. It's getting late. It might be dangerous. [mysterious music playing] -But I haven't finished-- -Do it tomorrow! Yes, ma'am. [intense music playing] [electronic music playing] ♪ What a handsome, cool guy ♪ ♪ What a sexy guy ♪ ♪ Yo! Give your heart to me ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ [phone dinging] Shit! He doesn't look like his profile pic. [beeping] Ek! Are you Oi? -Yes. You're Ek, right? -Yes. I was waiting on the first floor. I didn't know that you were waiting up here, and I didn't recognize you. The movie is about to start, so I thought I'd wait here. You didn't answer your phone, so I thought you'd stood me up. I wouldn't do that. My phone battery was low, so I came here to find a place to charge it. I didn't even know that you would be here. Oh! You're very pretty. -Even more beautiful in person. -Aw. I've never been on a date with a beautiful girl. I'm nervous. That's so nice of you. What a sweet talker. You're a real charmer. How many girls have you met through the app? I just started using it recently. I don't believe you. You did a very good job of editing your photo. But I think you look way better in person. Oh! It's all about the camera angle. ♪ Yo, yo ♪ ♪ Give me your heart ♪ ♪ You won't be disappointed I'm begging you ♪ ♪ Have mercy on me Come on, come on ♪ ♪ Like me Come on, come on ♪ ♪ Love me Come on, come on, be with me ♪ ♪ I'm a good guy I'm the one ♪ -♪ Who will always love you ♪ -[record scratch] [eerie music playing] [man, in movie] I feel like every time I'm near her, I'm so happy. But I'm not sure if she's happy. My heart pounds whenever I'm near her. It pounds harder and harder every moment. [heart beating] -[Oi] Let's go! -[Ek] Where are you taking me? [operatic music playing] [Oi] Have you heard that those who go into this theater never come out? OUT OF SERVICE Now here we are... right in front of it. You want to go inside? Why not? Are you afraid of ghosts? No, the security guard. If you don't come in, you'll miss out on something fun. I think... it's going to be fun in here. It turns me on. I like it. [clicks] [intense music playing] Hey! Since you're so nervous, want me to start? Wait! Wait! What is it? Please go easy on me. It's my first time. Wait! You've never had sex before? [inaudible] Are you sure? [intense music plays] Hey! There's someone behind us. What? Really? Yeah. I don't know who it is. Who? [breathing heavily] [eerie music playing] Someone's there. I saw her with my own eyes. An older woman. She seems low class. They let people come into this theater? This one shows films all day. If we can come in, anyone can. And now... [tsking] ...they might see me. I'm naked. Where's my shirt? -[intense music plays] -What's wrong? [Ek panting] What's wrong? -[Ek panting continues] -You startled me! Can we get out of here? Are you crazy? I don't have my shirt on. I can't go out like this. Use your brain. Is this the movie we were just watching? [intense music playing] [Ek exclaiming] What are you doing? You want me to put this on? Okay, whatever you want. [Oi exclaiming in annoyance] Hey! Wait! Hey! It's not quite on yet. Take it easy! Hey! Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Look at me! [both breathing heavily] Where's my cell phone? Where's my cell phone? I think we should call the staff. Ask them to help us find it. No! I want it now. It's my dad's phone. Could you get it for me? What? Why don't you go in yourself? Man up, will you? Just go in there and get it for me. You're such a... Ek. Please. Please go get my cell phone for me, and then we can go to my place. Seriously? We can continue this at your place? Why not? Please. Go get it for me. Please. It won't take long. Please. Please. Jerk! So annoying! [eerie music playing] [intense music plays] [intense music playing] [Oi gasps] [gasps] [intense music playing] [thrilling music playing] [Oi yelling] [Oi screams] [screaming] [woman laughing] [woman laughing maniacally] [laughing continues] [Oi breathing heavily] [Oi breathing heavily] [music increases in tempo] [breathing heavily] [thuds] [screaming] [man laughing] [footsteps approaching] [door creaking] [door clicks] [intense music playing] [breath trembling] [woman] Miss? Miss? Please. Help me. I'm stuck in here. [woman] Calm down. Please help me. I'm stuck in here. [woman] Miss, it's okay. He chose you. [crying] [intense music plays] [shouting] What do you want from me? What do you want? Get out! Get out! [thrilling music playing] [screaming] [electricity buzzing] [screaming] [crying] [footsteps approaching] [eerie music playing] Excuse me. Um, this theater is out of service. My friend is in there. She hasn't come out yet. [eerie music playing] Please wait. I've already asked someone for help. It won't be long. Please wait. Don't you work here? Can you go get her? [woman] Absolutely not! I mean, please wait until the movie is over to not disturb the other customers. But that theater-- [intense music playing] [breath trembling] All right. We should go in together. Seriously though, what's in there? [Ek] This is Oi's shirt. [eerie music playing] [breathing heavily] [intense music playing] [Phraeo singing] [tsks] [girl] Hey! [Phraeo] Nun, stop it! Stop kidding around. You're so lame. [eerie music playing] Wait! That's Oi's cell phone. Where is she? Oi! Hey! [Ek mumbling] [shushes] A new movie is about to start. We must leave. [Ek muffled] [guard] We have to leave now. [Ek muffled] [eerie music playing] Hey! Hey! Come out! Nun? Hey! I'm trapped in here! Help! Hey! [eerie music playing] Can you hear me? Help me! [woman] Phraeo. Working a night shift alone? [Phraeo] Yes. My friend asked me to switch shifts with her. -[Oi] Hey! -[Phraeo] She's scared of ghosts. Nonsense. There are no ghosts here. Don't go! Come back! Hey! Don't go! Help! Help me! Hey! [intense music playing] [Oi] Help me! [eerie music playing] [screaming] [ghosts laughing] [Oi screaming] [screaming] [Phraeo] That's when I learned that the theater used to be a Hindu temple and that they were showing movies as an offering. When they turned it into movie theater, it gained demonic powers. Many things happened. They lost money. But the worst thing was that people kept disappearing, so the owner turned the fifth theater into a shrine. [thrilling music playing] [gasps] [screams] [knife slashes] [knife slashes] [screams] [knife slashes] [Phraeo] The dolls from the old shrine were probably gone, so the owner summoned the god into a new doll. [rock music playing] -It's fucking hot. -Yeah. Come on. -Lat Phrao, please. -Sure, but that's three dollars extra. Of course it is. Everyone knows that. Get in, city girl. Put your bags in the back. Let's take a selfie. [camera shutter clicking] Hey! My fucking cell phone! [heavy metal music playing] Start. Okay. Pretty. [message dinging] Hi, everyone! I'm in Bangkok now. Safe and sound. If you know of any cool places to hang in, please let me know. I really feel like partying. Oh! If you want to order something, please DM me. If you need it soon, I'll send it to you first, but there'll be an extra charge. If you're not in a rush, wait until I get back home. I won't charge you very much. Promise! VIEWER: WHY DOES SHE LOOK SO GRUMPY? You ask her. It's not my business. Hey! They're asking what's wrong with you. Someone stole my cell phone. Now I have to buy a new one. It's hard to make money these days. STOP BITCHING, HOOKER! IT'S JUST A PHONE. But you're a millionaire! It's none of your business! I don't live off my parents like you! You should fix your brain instead of insulting me! Use your brain, not your pussy! You're probably using free Wi-Fi at a café, trying to be a hipster. Mind your own business! Try making my kind of money, then you can judge. Ugh! Unfriend me! I don't care! Don't judge other people! You piece of shit! Blathering moron! Dumbass! You psycho! You condescending shit! Asshole! Got it? Anyway, to the customers, don't forget to buy! And make sure you pay. Or I'll block you all! -Bee. -Hmm? Could you cut? I'm upset. But it's my live video. You don't have to say anything. I'll just chat with my followers, okay? Anyway, so-- [beeps] [dog barks distantly] [dog howls] FOR RENT PAY AFTER YOUR STAY "Pay after your stay"? You bitch! Where's my deposit? I used it to buy lottery tickets. I got some lucky numbers from the mediums, and then I dreamed about the numbers, but I haven't won anything yet. I'll pay you back if I win. Okay? Bitch! It better be soon! You said you told them to clean it. I did, but I guess they didn't do it. It's not my fault. Help me find the TV remote. Shorty! Before watching TV, shouldn't we clean the place first? [huffs] Why is she so angry? [coughing] [birds chirping] What a lame picture. Look at those kids. They don't even look alike. They probably had different fathers. Or maybe the old hag is his second wife. You have such a foul mouth. Let's take a selfie. [mysterious music playing] [beeping] Guess they want a selfie, too. Yeah, right. You wish! [camera shutter clicks] [intense music playing] HOUSE OF HORRORS 5 PEOPLE MURDERED - LAT PHRAO Look. This is creepy. That's good. We can use this haunted thing as an excuse to leave here early, so we don't have to pay the rent. Perfect. -Are you serious? -Yeah. But if you're scared, you can get rid of the picture. No! They'll charge us. I don't want to waste money. You're right. You're getting smarter, shorty! [mysterious music playing] [eerie music playing] [camera shutter clicks] [beeps] [beeps] [beeps] [dings] Hi, everyone! Today we're gonna do some yoga. Are you ready? First pose. Right. Second pose.

[sighs] That's not gonna make you taller, shorty. I'm going to buy a new cell phone. Let's continue! [intense music playing] Oh. Just a second. [Shorty sniffling] [sniffling] [sniffling] Very luxurious... and really fucking expensive. Whatever! I have to have it. It'll make me look classy. I don't want to look cheap. [phone beeps] Why did you bring this? You're so superstitious. -Shorty! -[sniffles] [sniffling] Shorty! What's wrong? Who hurt you? Tell me! -I'll make him pay. -[sniffles] Tell me! [sighs] I'm reading about what happened here. I feel so bad for them. The father killed the whole family, then he killed himself. [exclaiming scornfully] Don't trust the Internet! It's all bullshit. [phone dinging] [phone beeps] Time to make some money. And you're going to help me. [sniffling] [moaning in pleasure] [dance music playing] [moaning in pleasure] [music stops] [mysterious music playing] [eerie music playing] I want an omelet. A crispy one. With lots of fish sauce. I like salty food. [rhythmical creaking] [eerie music playing] [cell phone ringing] Hello. Who is it? [man laughing on phone] Nat? What is it? [Nat] I miss you. When can we meet? [Nat laughing] I want to see you. I've just been busy lately. I have to make money for university. [thudding] [intense music playing] Fuck... [banging] Shut the fuck up! I want to sleep! So angry. One second, Nat. [eerie music playing] Hello, Nat. Yeah. Well, I... I've been having some problems. I don't have any money for university. If I don't pay on time, I might have to drop out. And if I do that, I won't be able to graduate at the same time as my friends. [Nat] How can I help you? [Nat laughing] I wouldn't want to bother you. We've only known each other for a short time. I couldn't let you do that. [Nat] Just give me your account number. I'll transfer you the money. [Nat laughing] Go on, tell me. It's 6952024777, Purple Bank, $1,000. [Nat] I'm happy I can help you. Thank you so much for always helping me. I don't know what to do. Nat? Nat? Hello? [cell phone ringing] [dings] $1,000 TRANSFERRED TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT [Nat] Study hard and graduate soon. I'm here for you. Thank you so much. Love you! I'm going to bed now. Good night! [Nat] I'm not sleepy. Can you stay and talk to me? I have to wake up early tomorrow. I have to wake up at 4:00 a.m. for work. [Nat] That's all right. Tonight I'll dream about you. Good night, Nat. How did I get down here? What? Where did this come from? [creaking] [intense music playing] Holy Mother of God, if I did something wrong, please forgive me. [intense music plays] [sighs] [creaking continues] [intense music plays] [music stops] [breathing heavily] [eerie music playing] [gun clicks] [gunshots] [woman] Where are you? You think you can get away from me? Come out! Where are you? [intense music playing] [door creaking] [urinating] [mysterious music playing] Bee! Bee! -Mmm? -Wake up! Shit! I'm sorry. You're so disgusting, shorty! Didn't your parents teach you better? I'm scared. Of what? Ghosts! There are ghosts here. Where are they? [Bee] Where are you going? [mysterious music playing] [Ann] Come on! I'm going to find one. And if I don't find a ghost, you're dead. -No! No! -[Ann] Bee! No! [Bee whimpering] [Ann] Come on! -Come on! -[Bee] No! I don't want to. No! No! Bee, come on! [Bee crying] Ow! Ow! Where are you? Huh? Show yourself! -No! -She wants to see you. No, I don't! Where are you? Please stop. Ann. -Stop!

You need to learn your lesson. [Bee sobbing] Let me out! Open the door! [breath trembling] [sniffling] -Bee! -Yes? Why didn't you turn off the TV? You're paying the electric bill this month. I won't last a month. I'm so screwed. Why am I friends with a loser like you? So annoying! I couldn't sleep. Why did you turn it on? I didn't. The remote is there. [intense music plays] Seriously? [eerie music playing] Okay. The TV isn't even plugged in. [Bee whimpers] [Ann] Bee! Why did you put the picture back? Is this a prank? I didn't. [eerie music playing] [eerie music playing] -[intense music playing] -[both scream] Come on! Run! [both panting] Help me! [knocking at door] [doorknob rattling] [thumping on door] What should we do? [doorknob rattling] -[thunder rumbling] -Just like in a horror movie. What should we do? [both scream] [thunder crashing] [breathing heavily] What should we do? I don't know. You're smarter than me. Think! You're the superstitious one, you think! What? [intense music playing] Hurry up! [Bee] One second! Don't pull at me! Okay! What is it? A charm. Are you crazy? You want to charm them? [intense music playing] [Bee] Don't pressure me! Okay! Here it is! -[Ann] What is it? -A charisma amulet. You want to be popular with ghosts? Idiot! Throw it away! [thrilling music playing] [yelling] Hold on! Hold on! This is it! This is it! There you go! A talisman. That's good. We're okay now. It's a talisman. The most sacred one. My ex gave it to me. [exclaiming] [thrilling music playing] What about the Buddha image? Hold on! Hurry up! Here! [music stops] Birth control. [Ann] Which one? The morning-after pill. [both laughing] They're afraid of that? I guess. We're safe now. How is that possible? [cat meowing] [intense music playing] -[Bee screaming] -Bee! -[Bee screaming] -[Ann] Bee! Get out! How? You locked the front door. [intense music playing] -Ann... -[retching] [Ann retching] Ann! [intense music playing] You nasty bitch! I'm sorry. I won't do anything bad ever again. If I'd known this place was haunted, I wouldn't have come here. [intense music playing] You brat! You're a bad influence on my daughter. I don't know your daughter. Stupid ghost! Filthy mouth! Watch what you say! What's your name? Kaeo. All right, Kaeo. Now I know your name! You brat! Piece of shit! You think I'm afraid of you? Idiot! Asshole! You haunt people. Even hell doesn't want you! So your whole family is stuck here. I guess no one prays for you. Pathetic! You bitch! Show some respect! Stop your whoring! Study hard! Stop being a bad influence on my daughter! Don't call her "shorty." I don't like it! [groans] You moron! I'm not afraid of that pill! Don't you get it? I tricked you. [thrilling music playing] Get off me! Get off! [Ann running] [Anne] Fuck! [Ann crashing] [thudding] Ann! Ann? Ann! [birds chirping] [woman 1] It's downtown and very convenient. The rent is quite cheap, too. [woman 2] Here's a deposit. [man] Do you like the color? Please excuse me. -Okay. -Yes. [Bee sighs] Mom, I transfer the merit to you. Ann, be good to my mom. She's fierce. Otherwise she might kill you again. I have to go now. Bye.
