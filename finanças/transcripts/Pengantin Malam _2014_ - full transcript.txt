What's on your mind? You have swollen eyes. You're not sleeping well. Are you still having the nightmares? Why didn't you wake me up? Why should I trouble you? It's not that you believed me. Maya. I will not trust your hallucinations. You have to be strong to fight all those feelings. You're my wife. It's my duty to take care of you. Let's eat. I'll take my leave now. Don't go anywhere without informing me. What have you done to your hands? -Let's go to the clinic. -It's nothing. I got this when I was cleaning and hit the edge of the bed. It's nothing. Alright then. Take care. Razif, you have to be really patient. Maya needs all the support she could get from those around her. The amnesia that she's experiencing... ...right now could be caused by many possibilities. It could either be temporary or permanent. But doctor, I see her getting worse day by day. There also comes a time where she tried to hurt herself. Why don't you bring her to see me. I'd think of the best treatment to cure her. Please help me, doctor. You're my only hope... ...and I can't bear to see her in that condition. Razif. Why don't you take her on a vacation? Away from the house. Away from the thoughts that are bothering her. What's the matter with you? I had the nightmare again. Enough, Maya. Is there anything that you didn't tell me? What happened after the accident. What I mean is, is there anything that you're hiding from me? -Perhaps something that you've forgotten? -I've told you everything. I've got nothing to hide from you. Why does it haunt me? What does it want? Let's do it this way then. Don't worry, I'll take you to see Doctor Diana tomorrow. Perhaps you'll feel better after talking to her. I'm not crazy. Maya, stop with the daydreaming. Your mind will start to wander off things that you shouldn't think about. -Until when must we see Doctor Diana? -Until you're well enough. Until you've recovered your memories... ...and not thinking about these ridiculous thoughts. There's no coverage. Help me. Razif? Help! Maya! Maya, what's the matter with you? Maya, don't you worry. I'm right here with you. Okay. Within the last week,... ...were there any changes since the last time you came to see me? I'm still the same Maya. I couldn't remember anything after the accident. And it always haunt me. I felt estranged from Razif, too far apart. He doesn't believe a word I say. He says I'm rambling off and it's all nonsense. These feelings has nothing to do with your lost memory, Maya. It all comes deep from your heart. Don't force yourself. Believe in the force of Allah swt. Razif is still your husband, and nothing can change that. Do you remember the nightmare that I told you? The nightmare. The nightmare kept haunting me, doctor. The nightmare. The nightmare seems too close to me, doctor. The nightmare scares me, doctor. The nightmare scares me. Perhaps the nightmare are clues. Who knows? -Dear! -What's the matter? Who's that? This is Mak Anum. She's the caretaker for this villa. Don't worry. Mak Anum, you can resume your work. Get inside. I'll bring the luggage in. This is for you. All those pictures. Those are our memories. A memory that I couldn't even remember. It's alright. Take your time. You don't have to remember everything at once. What's important is that you're at peace here. Come, let me show you around. What's the significance of the 28th? The 28th? Why are all the calendars marked on the 28th? And they're all in the month of August. What does it mean? I don't know about the date. But, next week will be our second anniversary. Have you forgotten? Why are we here early? Dear. If we were to celebrate our anniversary,... ...it doesn't have to be on that particular date, right? Okay. It's like this. I've got many plans for our anniversary. But, that's not the issue. The issue is that we're already here. You're happy, and we get time to spend together. And forget everything. Who's there? Mak Anum? Miss? Miss? Where are you going? Miss? Miss? Miss? Maya! Okay. What were you doing in the middle ofthe road? If Mak Anum didn't wake me up, I don't know what'll happen to you. I saw a woman just now. The woman crossed here, holding a crying baby. I followed her to the front. Which woman is this, Mak Anum? Sir, I don't know which woman is this. -I don't know her. -It's impossible that you didn't see her. I saw her. Dear. Did you see a car then? The car that stopped in front of me. There's a doll in the car. The doll that I used to dream of, I saw the doll. Do you see the car? No, I didn't. I didn't see any car except the lorry that's about to hit you. Do you know how dangerous this is if it happens again? Enough, Mak Anum. Go and make the necessary checkups. Make sure all the doors are locked and return the keys to me. Yes, sir. Impossible. It's impossible that you didn't see it. I saw it. I saw it with my own two eyes. I'm not crazy! Maya. The house is safe and there's nothing here. You think too much. Enough. Let's go to sleep. -Good morning, Mak Anum. -Good morning. Mak Anum. Last night,... ...is it true that you didn't see anybody crossing this villa? Razif says that you saw me going out of this villa last night. What were you doing so late at night? I've took care of this villa for a long time. So, I need to make sure that the villa is safe. Who knows if there are robbers or anything else? It's alright. Mak Anum, I'd like to look around the villa, alright? Miss? Miss? Take this medicine. What were you doing in the woods while I'm gone? Mak Anum told me you came out of the woods all drenched. Maya, please. Don't go anywhere outside of this villa. I couldn't assure whether it's safe or not on the outside. If you knew that this villa is unsafe. Why did you bring me here? The villa is safe, Maya. It's calm. I've lived here since I was small. I should know. This villa holds many memories of the both of us. That's why I brought you here. And most importantly,... ...you can forget all the disturbances. Do you think I'm at peace here? -Hello. Peace be upon you, doctor. -Peace be upon you too, Razif. -How are you? -I'm good, doctor. How's Maya? I haven't heard about her for quite a while. Doctor, Maya's still the same. Now, she's getting worse. Sometimes what happened to her makes sense. But I still don't believe in all that's happened. Why is it so hard for you to accept it, Razif? Perhaps there's some truth to it. Or maybe it's just her feelings. Let's do it this way. I'll meet Maya. Alright? Alright, doctor. Mak Anum? Mak Anum? Mak Anum? Mak Anum? I've told you not to go out at night. Why is it so hard with you, Maya? I saw the doll again. How can the doll be around here? -I don't get it. -It's just your imagination, Maya. Forget it. I could go crazy if you continue on like this. Just sleep. Come here. Dear! Dear, open the door! Dear! Dear, open the door! Dear! Dear, open the door! Dear! Dear! Dear! Dear! Maya. What's the matter? What's the matter? What have you done? Maya. Dear. Mak Anum! Mak Anum! Madam, your breakfast. Mak Anum. She came again last night, Mak Anum. She still haunts me. It's just your feelings. Are you saying that I'm only dreaming? That everything's just a dream? Or you're saying that I'm crazy? Crazy? Mak Anum? I'm not crazy, Mak Anum. Please understand me. Please understand me. Sometimes, things happen. Things that happen beyond human's imagination. If you wish to know what happen,... ...look for the answers yourself. Answers? Mak Anum. I'd like to have a word with you. What have you told Maya? Nothing, sir. Don't try to lie to me. I didn't tell anything, just... ...that she told me she's being haunted. Pity her, sir. Her soul's not at ease,... ...she's in pain. Maya. How are you? Doctor, I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. What are you so scared of, Maya? The woman that I told you about,... ...she really exists. She really exists. She's in each,... ...of the corner of this house. Woman? The things that I dreamt of, everything became real. The doll. Flowers. The sound. -The sound. -What sound? And an image of a woman in a wedding dress. You've got a close connection to her, Maya. She's not going to let you go, Maya. She's really vengeful towards you, Maya. But, why me? But, why me? Why did she choose me? Perhaps you've taken what's rightfully hers. Who knows, right? Taken? What do you mean, doctor? It's nothing. Enough. Don't think too much. It'll add the burden on your mind. You wait here, I'll go and see Razif for a moment. -Razif. -Wait here. Maya. -Razif. -Doctor. How was your vacation? Is she getting better or worse? I don't know how to put it. You can see it for yourself. She's getting worse day by day, doctor. I don't understand it anymore. How was the theraphy with Doctor Diana? Was it okay? Don't bite your nails. Dear, I was thinking of visiting our neighbour after Maghrib... ...because there's been a death in the family. Wouldn't it be nice if we can go together? Okay. It's alright, then. I'll go there myself. You can stay with Mak Anum, alright? Okay. Where were you from? Dressing up nicely? I dolled up for you. It's not wrong, right? Do you want to ask me out tonight? Let's go for a honeymoon. Are you alright? Are you well enough? Of course. Let me change first. What are you doing here? I've been here. I never went anywhere. I couldn't escape anymore. She wouldn't let me. Maya. I'll be meeting a client for a short while. Don't go anywhere, alright? Don't do anything stupid. Don't make me worried. I'll take my leave. What's all this, Maya? Stop it, Maya! Are you scared, dear? What were you trying to prove in the bedroom? You scribbled it with number 28 and many other nonsense! Have you gone mad? You forgot. You're the one who chose the date. You promised that we'd be together forever. Laila? Impossible. Laila's dead. She can't be alive. Who says I'm dead?! Everything happened really fast. I didn't even realize when Laila was able to attract my attention. I was lonely, Maya. You were too busy with your career... ...that you've forgotten about your duty as a wife. But that wasn't an excuse. I'm the one who's guilty. I was so lonely, Maya. Lonely without you. Laila came in to fill the void. But that doesn't mean my love for you is washed away. I consider Laila as a place to go to while you're not on my side. Laila was hoping for more. She loved me wholeheartedly. This is all my fault, Maya. I'm the one who's sinned. -I love this place. It's perfect. -Do you like it? Dear, let's get married on the 28th of August? Dear? Dear! Dear, what's the matter? You seemed really tense. You're asking me why I'm tensed? What have you told Maya? Dear, is my dress pretty? What's all this? I could imagine how our wedding's going to be like. There'll be fresh flowers, many will come,... ...the theme will be a garden wedding, some sort like a fairytale. And I'll wear this wedding dress. It's really pretty. Don't you think so, dear? I will look really beautiful. And you'll look very handsome. What are you rambling about? Don't you get it? I'm already married and I love my wife so much. I won't hurt her feelings just like that. What do you mean? Didn't we promise to get married? We've chosen a date, do you know? What do you take our relationship as all these while? When did I ever promise you? I have no plans of marrying you. Okay. I apologize. For following my lust and be seduced by you. Laila, I admit. I like you but I've never planned to marry you. How could you, Razif. After all that I've done for you? I sold myself for you, for love. I hate you. I don't think we could continue on this relationship. Dear, please don't leave me. Please. Don't do this to me. -I beg you. -Get out of this house. -Don't leave me like this. -Get out, Laila! Get out! This is what you were up to? Too busy that you were unable to come home. So what the woman says is true. This is what you've been doing all these while! Maya, I could explain. Dear. There's nothing left to explain. I've seen everything. Dear. Dear. Please let me go. Dear, please. Please let me go. Let me go! I won't do this again. I'm sorry. You're a liar. You're a cuckold! Don't you get it? I'm already married. I couldn't hurt her feelings just ike that. Laila, I admit that I like you, but I've never planned to marry you. Useless man. You lied to me. You lied to me. How could you lie to me. -Maya! -Sir. -Why do you call me out this late night? -Mak Anum, please don't ask much. I want you to bury this gunny sack. And don't open it. Why do I have to bury this gunny sack? What's in it? Mak Anum! Do you hear what I'm saying? Bury this gunny sack and never open it. If you ever open this, I'll kill you, understand?! O Allah. Why did you torment her? She's in pain. Why did you do this to us? I love you. I don't want you to remember all those memories. I don't want to lose you. I felt tortured all this while. How could you keep all this from me. It's not like that, dear. Okay. I got driven by lust. But Laila was the one who seduced me. She was the one who wanted to marry me. I've never loved her. Damn you. I was still alive when you buried me, you devil. I was still alive when you buried me, Razif. You're dead. I was bearing a child when you killed me. I was pregnant with your child. Your child. You killed our child! O Allah. Laila, that's enough Laila. Maya's innocent. We're the ones who are guilty, Laila! Let her go. Forgive me, Laila. Forgive me, Laila. Let Maya go. Please, take me instead. It was me that you wanted, right? Don't hurt her. I love her. Laila. Enough Laila. There's no use to resort to this, Laila. You're already in a different world! Let go, Laila. Let go of Maya. Let her go. Please. You should feel the pain that I felt. Everyone deserves to make choices but you chose to hurt me. Maya. Maya. Allah the Almighty. Allah the Almighty. Maya. Forgive me, Maya. She's deeply hurt. I could feel it. She's hurt because of us. Maya? Maya? How's his condition? It's just the same. There's no changes at all. If there's nothing else, I'll get going. Religion has never failed humankind. Humankind are the ones who failed the religion. Lust tells us that a woman is beautiful by her looks. Logic tells us that a woman is beautiful... ...by her knowledge and intelligence. And our heart tells us... ...that a woman is beautiful by her morals.
