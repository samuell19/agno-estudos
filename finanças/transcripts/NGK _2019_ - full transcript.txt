My name is, Nandha Gopalan Kumaran. People call me, NGK. Finally, he's here. Mr.Kamaraj. [Noble Politician] Romance after you're done with the meal. Mom! You got eyes all over. Mmmm! Newly weds are bound to find an excuse and stay indoors. But you seem to stay outdoors the most. We've become a laughing stock to the neighbors. You don't like to live apart from us. Did I ever mention, that I don't want to? Here, she's the one who is stubborn on not leaving. Listen-- --if you're disrespectful of my daughter, I'll whack you. Be careful! If at all you're planning to, then take her abroad, like Singapore or America. For about two years, I took pride in boasting about it that my son is working in a huge MNC. But you quit the job soon after. And came down to do "Arakku Agriculture" "Arakku Agriculture" My genius mother, who failed 6th grade one too many times that's not called "Arakku Agriculture". It's called, "Organic Agriculture". Working for a MNC, is not that big a deal. Once we swipe our ID cards, they lock us up inside. Look-- --sitting on cramped up chairs our spines go sore, looking at the computers entire day. Food is served at the ring of a bell once it's night, they open the doors and let us go. Doesn't it, sound like a prison? But look at this it's peaceful leave early in the morning get down and work our hearts out in our field after a heavy lunch, taking a nap under the tree. Then when it's evening catch the beautiful sight of nightfall. Amazing! Beautiful! The breeze which is laced with the fragrance of the soil just close your eyes and experience it. But you're stuffed in heat under this fan. But out there, God blesses us with wind. Philosophical!? Wonder how she agreed to marry you? Definitely she's mad. That's not called "Madness". But, "Love". It's really late, if not you would've got whacked by me. Take this. Freaking' 20 bucks for this ice-cream. Why don't you guys go to your room? Don't start off right here. Ey! What are you sniffing at? The fragrance! Fragrance!? I'm not wearing any perfume. It's not the perfume, dear fragrance of the soil. That's the best, what I like about you. Brother, our pregnant neighbor's water broke and she's bleeding Husband and wife were fighting, and that rascal kicked her in the stomach. Oh no! At this hour neither a cab or an ambulance is available. Please come over soon. If you had been late by 5 minutes, the mother would've died. If you were late by 10 minutes, then both mother and child would've died. Doctor, what exactly happened? Both are safe, she's blessed with a baby boy. Sister, come over here... [CROWD CLAMORING] If you would like to know the truth I never slept even for a bit throughout the night. I'm not posing this as our party's achievement only when I heard that the mother and the child are safe I was relieved and came back to life. Doesn't matter, if it's late in the night or it's afternoon if you people have a problem, I'll be the first one to resolve it. Thanks a lot. Mmmm-- Kumara has began his antics We didn't spend a fortune to make our kids into social workers. Ask your son to be within his boundaries. If not... Ey-- just shut up and leave.

But the Health Minister is stationed in Delhi. India marks the first place in purchasing weapons. Ey-- people here don't even have water in their toilets. Please change the channel, change it! Will your son ever change? In this nation, everyone is a fanatic of something or the other. But him, a fanatic of this NATION! Sir! Brother Giri...! What happened to you? You've been hurt. They beat me up. Is it the, MLA? Brother... Everyone is aware of his nature. Why did you go to him? I didn't go there without a purpose. I've known him for sometime. I went to ask for a favor, as it was an emergency. Favour! That too, from him. What was the emergency? There's a very good alliance from Madurai, for my daughter The boy is very good. Both liked each other, the moment they met. But-- --the mother-in-law has demanded a dowry of Two Lacs. How can I afford it? I went to the MLA, 'cause I knew him. He was pitch drunk. "Fine, I'll lend you the money but ask your daughter to please me I'll teach her how to consummate the marriage". I yelled at him out of anger. And he beat me to pulp and threw me into this alley. Fine, let it go. Don't worry about it. My mother has saved up some gold. I'll pawn them tomorrow-- --and get the money. Son-- --even a dog on this street doesn't respect me. You're well aware of it. And you trust me in lending the money? Help, shouldn't be offered based on status or capability. Help should be offered to the needy. Why are you laughing? Nothing much let it go. C'mon say it. Just let it go. You wouldn't agree, to what I have to say. I can decide only if you say so. Listen-- --if people like you join politics just imagine the well being of this country. Are you kidding? Seems like you don't like me being at peace. Ignorance of educated youngsters-- --has tarnished our Nation to dust. I've been observing you being a nobody, you do a lot of good deeds. If at all you step into politics and take over this constituency there will be no end to your good deeds. Brother come on let's leave, stop blabbering. [CROWD CLAMORING] What is the issue? Since 3 weeks, I've been observing you people waiting here what seems to be the problem? Three Weeks!? It's been Three Months. Three Months! We're a group of ten people. Our fathers were Govt. employees. They passed away on duty. Govt. did announce that their jobs will be given to their next of kin. But this Collector, doesn't seem to sign the order. What!? Just get inside and ask them. Are you new here? Really!? Collector? After a long struggle we were able to meet only the Thasildar. And he's demanding 5 lacs for a posting. 'Cause this goes high up till the Collector. He justifies stating, we'll make that money in our lifetime. We did try every trick from the book. We lost our hope, and just come down for namesake. Listen-- --give me these papers, I'll get inside and check what's happening. That's the reason, we were looking at you... ...but still Come on give it to me, I'll be back. Kumara! Kumara, is that you? What are you doing here? I wonder-- --how you've never changed since the school. Don't get angry. This is a silly issue, I'll get it sorted in five minutes. You might know the MLA but do you think, he'll agree to do this? The other day with Giri... Fine, let it go. MLA is not required for such petty issues. Our Councilor, is more than enough to sort it. Councilor? Vanakkam brother. Listen, who is Latha Manoharan? People who are here for their dead father's jobs, please come here Thasildar has asked to come over sooner you can collect your order from The Collector himself. Oh God! Please hurry up. The Collector is waiting for you people. Haven't got their call letters, but started celebrating. Come on, give way. -Hey, Raja. -Mmmm. Just a Councilor... ...can control The Collector? You never change, do you? School topper or a State topper doesn't help when it comes down to the streets. Since last night, calls have been made to everyone not sure who is it it's cringing to hear them cussing. They demand to stop everything related to Organic Farming. If we don't, Brother, hearty greetings. -I'm quite scared, Kumara I'll call you back. Tell me. The others have been informed well about it. But you're an Integral cog. If you favour, the issue will be resolved in two minutes. I don't understand. You formed a group, and have been doing a lot of good deeds. Appreciate it! Why don't you stop the Organic Farming? Please, stop it right away. Due to that, we're getting affected. WE as in? Right from the shopkeepers to loan sharks Fine, I'll come straight to the point. Just like how you're their representative, I am theirs. So-- --I thought if we get together and sort this out That's enough brother, please stop it. If I don't stop? It's Friday an auspicious day, let's talk about good things. Stop it! I'm pretty sure, you will stop it. I'm leaving! Using artificial fertilizers destroys the soil Kolunji, Senapai, Erukku, Pungo, Venmbu, Adadhoda we should plant them in soil as creepers if we do it, the soil gets nitrogen in the most natural way. Soil has been destroyed, Kumara. They've mixed some chemical-- --and ploughed it with a machine. Hereafter, even the grass won't grow on it. Oh God, everything has been destroyed. They've tarnished everything. Bloody sinners, will never prosper. Kumara! Just look at this mess. Son, now this has happened next they'll turn us into handicap moreover, they're being very abusive. They're being very abusive. Brother-- -Sister! --I beg of you Let go off everything. Let us live in peace. My son quit his job to join and help you with agriculture. After looking at the incidents he committed suicide. We rushed him to the hospital by the grace of "Goddess Maariaatha" he is out of danger now. For God sake, don't destroy their lives. Brother, this is a grave issue. You made too many enemies at once. Loan Sharks Pesticides businesses Vegetable traders who sell them at exorbitant prices Do you think they're alone on this matter? And then comes the Police Ward Councilor Municipality including our MLA has a cut in the profits. If you jump in and change everything their income is affected. Brother, please think of a solution. Poor thing. People invested their trust in me and got into this mess. You better do one thing go and meet the MLA straight away. If he decides, then will make it happen. Who? are you referring to, Pandian? -he's a bloody.... -Ey! Let that go. Think on practical terms. The gang of loan sharks is a mafia itself. If someone powerful like Pandian asks, they'll obey. Fine! If that's the case why would he even help me with this? This is extremely atrocious. You're underestimating your power. Elections are around the corner. You have a great reputation with the people. At least for that sake, he'll agree to meet you. We'll think about the rest later. Ey, come on move...move move, come on he's our friend. Ok, brother. He's Raja's friend. Hi Kumara, how come you're here? MLA Sir... ...want to meet him. MLA!? That-- --that man is What is it? Is it something urgent? Mmmm! Listen! You're asking for a huge help in the name of favour. Sir-- --an entire town is... -Mmm-hmm! -Hmmm -Chief! Did you calculate? if we do him this favour, what will be our loss? Nothing substantial though. Loan sharks, shopkeepers even after the bribes, it's a meager amount. If you ask them, they'll shut their pie holes. Ramakrishna! that's right, the impending issue Kumaran has come to meet me. Get this done with, right away. I have given my word to him. Ah-- so are we good? Get it done. He'll get it done. Sir... ...thank you! -Ey! -Huh? What happened? Sir! You came got your work done, and just leaving I don't get it, Sir. Don't you get it? I've done what you had asked for what are you going to do in return? It's not like that for the people, you... Damn it! I helped, 'cause of the reputation you have with the people. Better be clear on what you will do in return. If not, I'll call them back then they'll destroy you. Brother, brother... ...ah, brother brother, brother -brother! -My Lord! What brought you here? Your wounds are still fresh. Chief, it was me who brought him here. Oh...! So you're a gang of thieves. Are you going to tell me, what you'll do in return? if not, bloody moron Chief, he's not as simple as you think he's got an army behind him. That too youngsters. They'll be very sharp with their work. You just give us the nod brother here, will join our party with 500 members. -Brother!? -Ssshh! Just imagine-- --if you go to the High Command with the youngsters your status will soar heights. Elections are around the corner. Ah...! Listen-- --will you join our party with 500 members? Chief, I vouch for him. Ey! If I lose my temper I'll hack you into pieces bloody moron! Ey-- Kumara! I'm talking to you. Will you join our party with 500 members? Then, fine we're even now. I'll tell you when to come over. Be ready! Ey! Have you decided to run the entire family into the grave? Huh!? I didn't bother, as you were into social service. But now, you want to get into politics. Hey! Politics is a graveyard. No one has returned alive by stepping into it. Your father and I had many dreams pinned and spent a fortune on education you're now throwing it all away. Listen-- --can you please calm down? The people are happy now. For this to happen-- --you don't know, what I had to go through But that, MLA made it happen, like it was nothing he changed the lives of everyone Not only him even my friend, Raja he's just a votary of that party The things they do it in a jiffy we end up slogging for it our entire life. I've been observing everything I have-- --given a deep thought about it Is that enough? Only if I get into it, can change the system I'm taking it up. Will step in, and bring the change. You're going to witness it. Fine, get into it tomorrow when you return you'll find us all dead. Mother-in-Law! Can you please stop this? I've been patient about it. Let's not trouble him. Whatever he feels right-- --let him do it. Oh God! -Have you gone mad too? -Ma! Will you please get inside? Viji. Mmmm. He'll never do anything against his morals. Listen-- --how is struggling for nation's welfare is wrong? I have confidence. As far as you do, it's fine. I don't like your tone. Can't you say something nice? Fine, you go. But don't come back a loser. This resonates the same tone. Kumara! go ahead dear--- ---If you step in, even the sewers will turn pure. [CROWD CHEERING] Kumara, do you see the guy on the right? His name is Saghayam. If he touches his nose, you have to scream out loud. but when he touches his ear, you have to applaud harder. A bit-- damn it. If he touches his thigh you gotta take a leap forcing yourself to meet the Chief. Do you understand? "Beloved throbbing spines inside my veins." Kumara! Kumara! come on scream out loud. Brother, how does a spine throbs inside a vein? Yes, shut up and just scream out loud. On the occasion of my birthday-- --millions have gathered like a wave of the Tsunami. I have a good news to share on this beautiful day-- --it's the period where everyone is shaken by the ruling party. From, Sirvalliputtur --Kumaran of ruling party has come to join us with 500 members. Come on, Kumara! My dear young Lion, come on up. Brother Kumara, Chief is calling you. C'mon go ahead. When was I part of the ruling party? Ssshhh...they're calling you. Come on, go over there. come on, keep moving. Keep moving, keep moving. Go! -Welcome, Kumara -Chief, this the guy I was talking about. -Come on, son. -Go on, hug him tight. In respect to appreciate Kumaran-- --I'm rewarding him with this Golden Sword. The youngsters from the ruling party, floating on false hope I wish, you bring them all to us. Will you do it? -Will you do it? -Tell him, you'll do it. Will you do it? Hey! Chief! My dear Pandiya, who is behind this great achievement Give that to me. This is just for namesake get lost. come on, get lost. Thought getting into politics will pave way for doing more good deeds. Golden Sword! Pretending to be someone. I don't get any of this. Politics is very deep. You've just stepped into it. You'll understand eventually. I'm not sure, brother. I have a feeling, that I'm doing something wrong. Moreover, people doesn't have a good impression about politicians. Just wait and watch. I'll teach you exactly, what a politician can do. Just sit back and watch. Ey-- ******! stop the vehicles, damn it. stop that ******* auto. ********! Ey...! What do you think of me, bloody idiots. Ey! I kill you, I'll kill you all. Ey! What the heck have you been doing? Here, a Goddess-- --my dear Mother of Dharma. She's been stranded for half an hour, not able to cross the road. But you guys have been looking at her like morons. Freaking, I'll kill them all. I'll kill them all. Sir, Sir! Please don't get angry. You please leave from here. -Ey, hold the traffic. -Ok, Sir! Hey, stop all the vehicles. Come on, stop. Auto, please stop. My dear son, I pray that you live in prosperity. Come on take this for your expenses. You please leave from here. You've been blocking the traffic. You better be scared of me. If this was done by a common man-- --they would've thrashed him. Hope you understand now-- --the importance of being an Politician. I've understood it well. Firstly-- --I need to buy at least 10 boxers. You're damn funny. Come on eat your food. They don't give second serving. -Brother Giri -Mmmm. Introduce me to the good politicians of the party. Gotta discuss about the issues of our people. Don't be too enthused on the very first day. You're well educated-- --no matter what job you're in you got to climb up the ladder, one step at a time. Aren't you aware of it? Hey...hey...hey Ey-- look here pass it on Ey--Ey! Hey, I'm diabetic and can't run come on pass it on, I'm not able to run Welcome, Mr.Kumara. No, no, no, no... "The Golden Sword" Ey-- look over here guys The Golden Sword has arrived. What is it? Nothing much... Is there any job for me? That's the reason-- --educated morons should pick the stream they belong to. Stepping into politics with a meager crowd-- --doesn't mean they'll make you one of their own. If you suck up to everyone for 30 years you might land a posting in the party. Fine, you did get me a recognition among the party members. I do owe you one. Next time, I'll help you with something huge. You should be grateful than a dog. Understood!? Go on, join the herd. First make sure you get water in the toilet. The taps aren't working it seems. The sad state of MLA hostel. Come on hurry up. First make sure to clean the toilet-- --then get the water. Mr.Golden Sword, the water wasn't enough it didn't flush well take that broom and...Eh, Eh! also wash all of my dirty clothes. I'm leaving out of town in the morning. What are you looking at? come on deal the cards. Ok, Chief! Mr.Sword! Mmmm! There will a number under the name G call that number and just ask to come down -Chief, I'll make that call -Shut up, damn it. Hey, Kumara why are you enduring this? Instead of being at peace, you're stuck with him Tell me something, Raja I've seen you play poker you always win. Why do you keep losing to him? No one should win against him. If not he'll tie them to a tree and beat them up. That sadist gets a kick out of it. Chief, you're going overboard you're asking Kumaran to drop the girl. What's wrong, if he drops her? Social worker, Votary of the people-- Mr.Kumaran ****** moron! Let him do it. He tarnished my name in that locality. Cleaning the sewers, Organic farming that's why I made him clean my shit. Ey---get out and cough. Why the hell is your nose bleeding? You must've chug down the whole bottle. Hey, Kumara! We saw you on the TV. They rewarded you with a Golden Sword. But I don't see any sword in your hands? Listen, mother-in-law has made your favourite mutton curry. Hurry up, before it gets cold... The people and the Leaders of the party-- --think very less of the votary. Hanging on to the vehicles Biriyani, Liquor they've made peace with it. But our generation is nothing like that. We're educated we know what we're doing. Our perspective is entirely different. Starting from roots, no matter how huge the matter is That's the beauty of it! Brothers! Vanakkam brothers!

You can even take my wife away but don't ask for him. Signature. Here, put your signature. You sign it too. Signature! What happened? Hey, Raja! Hey! He came to me a year ago, it's End-Stage disease. I mean Terminal Cancer. there's no cure for it. Anytime death! He's well aware of it. What is this place, Chief? This is our Party Headquarters. Press 9 There are only 8 buttons out here. Press both 8 and 1 at the same time. That's the floor, the High Command presides. It's not easy to get there. You will be summoned only to get questioned. Are all the papers in order? Mmmm, yes they're in order. My dear, don't call me "Chief" in front of them they'll gouge my eyes out. You better stay outside. On top of it, that Vanathi-- --will kill me with her questions. Who is that? Vanathi...! Is she, Chief's...huh...huh? No, no, no, no... This is entirely different. She's the PR head of entire Indian Operation. High Command, doesn't do anything without consulting her. What should be spoken at a meeting what's happening in the constituency the culprits who swindled how much bribe was distributed not only that, the motto of the party and the election plan. To whom and what should be spoken at Delhi Which party will favour the victory if made an alliance. She decides them all. She'll be on her laptop all the time. She's a deadly women. She'll skin and fry you alive. What are you saying, Chief? Why are you scared of her? You got to fear, when it's required. Ey-- make sure you're in sight. Vanakkam, High Command. You've been an MLA thrice. With the support of caste votes. You haven't done squat till now. How come all of a sudden now? In this past 6 months, you've tended to all the petitions. Mmmm!? The entire constituency is praising you. How's that? Is it 'cause, election is around the corner? It's not that ma'am, I just did it for the people... I did it to gain more reputation for the party. -I... -Ey.. ...don't make me swear at you. Are you going to blurt it out? I joined hands with educated youths from the constituency Are you talking about the guy standing outside? No, no...he's just garbage. He's just a helping hand. I just brought him along for company. This is an agricultural land how come you've given permission to construct a building? It's wrong according to RULE #43 C Your garbage-- sorry --call your helping hand inside. -Pandiya! -High Command! I've warned you not to lie to Vanathi. What is this? You don't need his permission. You tell me. That's right, Ma'am. It is wrong according to Rule #43C but according to #44E if the Thasildar certifies it's not an agricultural land, we can construct buildings over there. I've attached the certificates for reference. What is being constructed there? Is it Dental College under a shell name? No madam. There are many chemical factories around the number of cancer patients have increased in that area. So we're building a Free Cancer Institute. Free!? That too him? Not him, madam. United Nations in India. They've applied and it's been sanctioned. Not only that-- --If Pandiyan Sir continues to be the MLA our future plans have a look at the graph development comparison for the last 20 years GDP growth compared to other constituencies. What have you pursued? -Oh no! he's done nothing -Ey-- shut up! Tell me. And of course, Agriculture. Politics!? I'm learning, Madam. Ok, he doesn't need you anymore. You can join our PR team. Sorry Madam! I won't leave Pandian Sir, for anything. Thank you so much. It's been a pleasure meeting you. High Command! Must've been the good deeds from my previous birth The spines are throbbing inside my veins. It's rising high. Hail High Command! -Chief! -Hey...! I don't like him. He fed my own quotes to me. There's something fishy about him. In my 40 years of experience-- --he seems like a weird character. It's better you keep him under the, Red List! Call in the next one. Hey! I signed entrusting you who asked you to get the cancer thing to be done? Oh no! I did inform you, Chief. You were pretty sloshed the other day. Still... ...I thought you'll leave me for Vanathi's offer If I leave you-- --then who will clean the toilet? Five days haven't been to the hotel neither have I changed my underwear no luck! CM and the ruling party are very cautious. No matter how much we dig deeper, it's the usual Scams, Political Murders-- but nothing special. We exactly have 6 months for the elections. Keep trying. We need something huge we have to instigate the people and hit them with a wave Vanathi! we tried everything possible couldn't find anything personal emails, Facebook...nothing. They're very careful. Keep trying. Hail High Command! Not bad-- --you made it in 10 minutes. Seems like you don't sleep. Seems like you don't sleep as well. Madam! No madam. I am Va... Vanathi Thiagarajan, M.A.Political Science Cambridge University. Worked for Times magazine for 4 years worked for almost all PR companies and started her own called "Solutions". Prime Minister's office, 3 Chief Ministers totaling 15 Political parties. from which 3 Political parties are unknown to this world. You've drowned 7 political parties and helped 3 win. Just 'cause High Command insisted you've been helping him. It's 'cause you both are remotely related. Even the party members are unaware of it. Your salary for a month is 1.2 Crores. If you've called me at this hour, must be something really important. Good Evening, Ms.Vanathi. Tell me, how can I help you? You are Kumara... Nandha Gopalan Kumaran. the rest is mentioned in the files on your table downstairs. You must've gone through it. So it'll be great, if you get straight to the point. You! Too smart. Welcome to my den. Come, I need some information from you. CM Killvazhuvan! If you wanna light it, shouldn't do it from top it'll take time to reach the bottom neither you should light it from down below it'll take longer for it to reach the top. Mmmm! So, if you light up the middle front it'll light both the top and the bottom right away. Kesava Moorthy: Health Minister under his support, illegally foreign medical companies are testing the medicines on the patients over here. This information is useless. This will never reach the public. They'll forget about it in two days. They need some strong sentiment to hold on to. Who are you calling? Underground! The lowest votary of the party will be the keeper of all the secrets. -Ah, brother Giri. -Ah! What is it? How come you're calling in so late? It's urgent, just answer to the question. Weren't you part of the ruling party earlier? That's right, as it didn't work out, I shifted to opposition. Are you aware of Kesava Moorthy? I know him well, he's a womanizer. Even during the last week. -Ssshhh... I want to know more about him. Thanks for the help. We got what we needed. But what you're asking in return-- --is quite impossible. Even If I agree to do it-- --not sure if it will work out. You have a very little exposure. But I can guide you. The rest is in your hands. It's just pure luck. What!? First time I met Vanathi? No, I don't understand your question. Hey! What happened? I smell perfume on you. I'm coming from Party Headquarters. May be someone out there must've have wore perfume. Ladies Perfume! very , very strong! It's not imperative that only men work in such a huge office. Even I used to wear perfume. I used to like it a lot. I know a lot about it. There are many ways someone's perfume sticking on to others For instance, if you pass by, it won't stick longer even if someone stays this close for long you will just get a whiff of it May be if-- --someone gets so close it will only stick to the face But this... Hey, hey...Ey, Ey! Let go! Only if something like this happens it gets through the body reaches the nose and ignites the fragrance. Ey-- what's wrong with you? Huh!? It's wrong. -Hey... -It's wrong! Something is not right. Come on, don't tell me you're so serious about the perfume. Ma, you're very innocent. You're not aware of anything. Who? Me is it? Even when your Father-in-law gets back from duty abroad, he will smell of perfume. Mmmm! May be even he was having an affair. Oh...! What if he did? Aren't you his mother? -confront your son. -Dad! It's getting late, Dad. The day I got him married to you -Patience, son. -since then, I'm done. You've asked for something out of the ordinary. It's a special Military line. Untraceable! Fine, what's wrong with both quarreling outside? Geetha is suspicious-- --that I'm having an affair. Are you? What nonsense? Which ****** is calling me at this time? The ******* who served this country for 30 years. I'm Retd. Major General Ramanan, speaking you moron. Sir! Yes Sir! At ease, Colonel. Sir, thank you, Sir! I need some information. Yes Sir! Do you know the current CBI Director? No Sir. Brigadier Sharma, knows him well. They're close friends, Sir. -How close? -Ah... ...Sir Tell me Colonel, it's an order. Yes, Sir. They're bar mates, Sir. They drink every Sunday. And...and do Bang-Bang, Sir. What? Bang-Bang? Same women? No Sir, different women. They both are best Bang-Bang friends, Sir. Ok, listen carefully. Yes Sir! Ask Sharma to speak to CBI Director immediately. I need some information. Since he got into Politics every thing has changed about him The thing he had on me... Love! ...do you think it wouldn't have changed? Why don't you confront him, yourself? Is this enough? or you're looking for something more? Dad! Never knew you were such a big shot. That respect is not something I deserve do you see that medal, "Param Vir Chakra" the highest award in Military the respect is offered to that. A person when dies and is taken in a coffin the world doesn't give a damn about the wealth, position or status Only your achievements will stick to you. Hey! What is it? Who are you? Ey! Ey, hold on...Ey! Listen... Hey...! If Intelligence Bureau has nabbed me I'm sure something is very serious. Let's not beat him up for no reason. I'll only talk to the CM. It's better you start talking, if they start beating you up... I don't mind though... ...but the thing is, it's a personal matter for CM. It's better, if it's only for his ears. Isn't he beside you? Ask him to talk to me. CM is not God though. Won't he speak to the Public? I've been looking forward to-- --speak to that person who has swindled millions. OUT! What is Nandha Gopalan Kumaran, saying? Good Afternoon, CM Sir. Social Activist got into the opposition party in haste. You're the only helping hand of Pandian. All that is fine. But you--- ---went to meet Vanathi during late night at their own office we've been observing you you see Elections are around the corner. Sir! So, Intelligence bureau is not present to nab the criminals? You have 10 seconds, if not-- Sir, I only speak the truth. Hope you get it. First, start talking. If I start talking, will you do me a favour in return? Hey-- how dare you negotiate with me? -In a second, I'll... -make me disappear I really don't mind. My information is like having lunch at a five star restaurant. In return, I'm just asking for a small tip. Ah... Not only that-- --Vanathi will share everything with me. And I'll tell you everything what she says. Honorable Leader! Just give it a thought. Kumaran, you're not even a mosquito to me. First tell me, then I'll decide. Only I decide! Now, shut the **** up and spit it out. You're amazing with English. Seems like you have plans to get to Delhi? But you've been working hard for it. You just studied until 8th grade-- --but should appreciate Catherine teacher for her efforts Dearest lover! A wife hidden from the eyes of the world. Am I right, CM Sir. Untie him and stay outside. Wait for my orders. Ok, Sir! You gotta talk to survive these days... here... I'm saying this for your own good. You do know who's been threatening to break your party. Kesava Moorthy! Am I right? In next two days, his Political career will be doomed. I will make it happen. How? I'm well aware but won't give out my idea The opposition is digging for dirt on your party at the same time, it should benefit you as well. I'm in favour of both the parties. No matter who is gonna win, I should survive, right? I like you. Shall we talk for another five minutes? Just 5 minutes! Ok! Will start now. Upload it. Everyone, on your toes. Timing is everything. My name is Selvi. And this is my daughter, Kayalvizhi. I was able to provide my daughter education up till 12th grade. I couldn't afford her higher education I went to Minister Kesavan Moorthy looking for help. And that person, in the pretense of helping us has destroyed my daughter's life. Now my daughter is pregnant. Madam, you've accused Minister Kesavan Moorthy do you have any strong evidence supporting that? I most definitely have. the atrocities he did to us, has been recorded on this phone. I will hand this over to you people. No matter where we go, we've been ripped off justice even the Police are chasing us away. If it was your child, will you people stay quiet about it? Listen-- don't make a big deal about it It can't be undone now Come and meet me, I'll do the needful. No one should endure what my family is going through. Selvi has accused Minister Kesavan Moorthy of molesting her daughter. She also have submitted an audio clip as evidence supporting it. This is has created a commotion among the people. That's completely a lie. I have no idea, who is that girl. I've never seen her in my life.

Huh!? Kumara, your plan is great but you won't achieve the reach you're looking for. People will look at your face for a while and flip the channel you will trend on Twitter and Facebook. but you'll be forgotten in couple of days. Not enough, definitely not enough. Death buddy, death! Someone has to die. Only then people will get interested. Hey! Hey. Take this and stab me in the chest. Then blame it on the ruling party and start crying out loud. you cry should shake up the world. Come on, stab me. Don't think too much either ways I'm gonna die. It's better you kill me so that I'll rest in peace. There's no need for this freaking promotion. Get home, damn it. Ey-- please don't. Ey-- Ey, let go off me. -Ey..Ey! -Listen to me for a moment Let go off me, damn it. Don't let your struggle go for waste Ey-- if I die in this situation my party will reward me with money and ruling party will provide compensation. On top of it, you'll take care of my family for life. Instead of dying like an orphan at the hospital I feel this is a blessing from the God himself Ey! Kumara, please do it -Ey! -You'll be doing me a favour Just shut the hell up. Ey...! Fine-- at least we'll move forward with the set plan. The boys got beaten up entrusting us we should do something in return. Just hold this knife. I should call and ask them to stop the smoke. Hey...! It doesn't hurt, buddy. 'cause it's you who did it I'm at peace now. You'll rise up to great heights. You'll be really successful. Take care of my family. My daughter is very good at studies. Make her pursue IAS. Also get her married... RAJA! RAJA! RAJA! Minister Kesavan Moorthy of the ruling party-- --against whom Nandha Gopala Kumaran staged a protest a votary member, Raja was killed. Following to that, the Chief of the Party Pichaimuthu while returning from the funeral of his party member Raja "Raja's loss is quite a loss to the party as well". Also stated that his family will be rewarded with 5 Lacs from the party funds. Owing to Raja's death which happened during the protest Chief Minister Killvazhuvan has expressed his condolence. Also has made it clear that the protest had nothing to do with his party. Moreover, Kesavan Moorthy who brought disgrace to the party will be dismissed from the post of Minister, also will be removed the party. Come on, move-- give some space. Come on madam, move aside. Brother! High Command, I have nothing to do with it. Kumara! Just the thought of you is so overwhelming. It's really astonishing to see the crowd gathered for him. He has bestowed the party with immense pride. Come on, he's the pride of Tamilnadu. But, could've mentioned it to us in prior Your perfume, is it Versace Special Edition correct? Mmmm-- I've heard a lot about you. I meant-- about the perfume. Vanathi... Do you want all of them together? Or just Kumaran with our Chief? Just Kumaran with him. Ok, Vanathi. Oh...! So it's you!

Mmmm-- can't deny the fact though she is very beautiful. Bombshell! May be to impress, this is what required. Gym, diet control I think the women of her stature always on to the married men. The husbands have no control though wonder how they live with it? I can't be so shameless. Has everything been completed as per his plan? How come he was aware of it? I knew about it or it's you people who knew about it Sir, I swear on my mother who is not alive anymore Sir, my post as Chief Secretary post is by your grace just 'cause my wife spoke ill about you I never spoke to her for a year and I've been here along with you... ...you're well aware of it, Sir. Sir one detail from his background has been pricking me Spit it out! During childhood, he used to spend the holidays at his father's camp. That streak continued until his father retired from Army. So, that could be one of the reason... My Dad used to sell stash-- --stop with the nonsense. A-Team! Move aside madam. -We're taking him for a scan -Ah! Get him. Be careful. Let's leave. Please you wait here-- --no one is allowed there. Ey-- come on guys. Sir, we managed to put him down. This is what happens, when you lock horns with the ruling party.

Excuse me, please. I'll answer only to my people. Their love is what saved me from death. Oh Kumara, our messiah you should have a blessed life, a blessed one May be I was born to a mother--- ---but according to me every Godly woman in this county is my mother. Hey, come on move. I see all your faces daily on the TV why should I catch a live one now? Let the people watch me today instead. My son, now I'm asking you my beloved son what exactly happened? Who came to kill you? Do you think the killer will reveal his name? It seems we've become united and have turned into one family they don't like me being here that's why they wanna kill me Hey, why are you crying for that?

[MULTIPLE CHATTER OVER THE PHONE] What is it? These larger than life antics was it her idea? Seems like-- --she has wrapped you around her finger. Fine! Let it be. What's it with you? That's what I've been asking you when you can speak so much about her why don't you agree that you're having an affair? Mr.Kumaran! That's right, damn it. I'm having an affair, what can you do? -Ey, Kumara! -Viji what's wrong with him? Just 'cause you agree out front I'm just not gonna talk to you Just like that. You have no better job, but to tease me. Don't I know that my husband won't lurk with a tramp. Political circle hanging around with women is quite common obviously I'm aware of it My Kumaran is a gentleman. I don't require a third person to certify it. Go and take a shower I'm just going out to the store to get a perfume for me. Damn it! that's the root 'cause for all the problems. I'll be back soon. What did I lose? If you're heading towards the peak of success an ordinary party member will have to sacrifice more than you think. The price I paid for it was-- --my life! Aren't they arch rivals? How come they look so friendly? Back in those days, they were best friends. They parted due to difference in opinion. How did he manage to bring you down? I thought you were very strong. Seems like he made you dance to his tunes. I know you won't say anything. As if, you're at peace. These days, we have to look for our names in the newspaper. It's entirely filled with Kumaran's name. "The future of the Party", "Leader of the Youth Wing" his name is being considered for the post of a Minister. On top of it, the wave of support from the people is huge. All that is fine, Pichai you don't like anyone preceding you isn't that why you tried to kill me Ah-- come on, Killi that's great, both used to be best friends must've got reminded of it. You still haven't got over it? Didn't you try to kill me in an accident? Oh God! The conflicts are increasing, Killi I've never seen your party getting tarnished like this in years That's fine-- --we have an understanding between us. Why do we need a third competitor now? Oh God no... My party's reputation did get damaged I have to stay put at the moment. Why don't you do something about it? No, no, no... He's the Chief Minister, first seek his blessings. Oh, come on. You're political genius, you have to seek his blessings. Come on! The peaks of politics are in front of you come on take their blessings together. Be blessed and live a prosperous life. Vanakkam! Carry on. No matter who among us come to power we manage to survive each other Be careful-- --this wave of Kumaran, will bring in a thrid alliance -our business will get destroyed -I understood. Do something sooner, my friend. Sure I will, we'll do it together. Vanakkam! -Vanakkam -Take care! Hello! Room Service, Madam. This is your pistol. I know, that you're angry. so... ...as a precaution. What do you want? You're under the impression, that I used you. I swear, I did not. Ah...uh... Raja... ...all of a sudden It was totally unintentional. Trusting me, is totally up to you. I do lie But-- --I will never lie to you. That's something Vanathi... ...herself is well aware of. Repeat that again my name... Vanathi! Then-- --Kumaran, Sir. Finally achieved what you intended to do. From being an ordinary votary of the party I've become a fool, madam. You've made everyone your enemy now. Hereafter, your days are numbered expecting your death. You won't believe, what I have to say during last night, death... ...here, I was this close with an encounter That's the truth. What else do you expect? It's not only you, who is looking to change the system. We too... But not everyone can fight death like you do. So it's better to shut up and mind your own business. Mmmm-- don't you see me exist? Pretending to be blind, when you can see. So, surrender! Instead of getting myself destroyed doing good I became one among the public. Look, I'm at peace now. I've got wealth, properties moreover you're there too. That's enough for me. What? Amongst everything... ...you added me to your list. Just 2 seconds, the power will be back. Five Star Hotel. Poor thing, you must've not experienced it. Instead of getting tortured by the light of a candle this is heaven compared to it. So, you mean to say candle is my wife-- --and you're the Five Star Hotel. Wow, what a punchline. It's too dark. Hey! It's the mirror... -Oh...Oh! -What are you looking for? Nothing, I came by Govt. Bus I've been stinking due to that. I gotta shower. But I can't seem to find a door. Even the shower is surrounded with glass This... Five Star Hotel. Understood! â™ª My love â™ª â™ª My love â™ª â™ª My dearest love â™ª â™ª My dearest love â™ª â™ª I've been longing for a relationship, which shines in darkness â™ª â™ª been struggling to fulfill this poor girl's extended desire â™ª â™ª as a rain drop will submerge into the sea â™ª â™ª Sweetheart 'O' Sweetheart â™ª â™ª would you be able fulfill this anxious girls desire â™ª â™ª Would you accept me? â™ª â™ª revere, will it revere â™ª â™ª will I be able to witness this beauty? â™ª â™ª will I get defeated? â™ª â™ª Does the soil shy-away at the grace of raindrops â™ª â™ª what would they say, if we get together â™ª â™ª Vision 'O' beautiful vision â™ª â™ª your love has blown me away â™ª â™ª It inspires me â™ª â™ª hope I'm able to get over the desire of sleeping on your shoulders â™ª â™ª you're the untold secret which the world is eager to know â™ª â™ª Thought of you when I'm lonely â™ª â™ª re-doles with the scent of you â™ª â™ª everything seems to fall in place â™ª â™ª like the rooster which doesn't fail to doodle â™ª â™ª 'O' the skies of summer, seems like its spring â™ª â™ª even the isolated forests clatter with noise â™ª â™ª My love, dearest love â™ª â™ª our lives are taking a new shade â™ª â™ª It's changing â™ª â™ª Our relationship â™ª â™ª is getting jeopardized like the split of an atom â™ª â™ª It's happening â™ª â™ª will this heart bear the meaning of a heartless language â™ª â™ª Is one life enough to live with your forever â™ª I need an advice from you. So, you came for this pretending to meet me. I'm just asking, 'cause I met you. It's up to you, to give one or not. Sit down. You know it very well, that I can't say no to you. You've been manipulating me with that. You want to become an MLA. Fine, your popularity is ok. a face well known to the constituency. Got an image of a kind person. But what about money? Huh!? Can you win? If you've been given a seat to contest? Don't you need money for that? That too in millions. Ground work, publicity materials, coverage on top of all, every vote should be bought public will demand though. This is the reason, millions are being swindled to spend on Elections. No! We don't use even a cent of our money during elections. Then? Party Leaders who is strong politically in spite of these being the factors do you know who are the real "Kingmakers"? these Corporate companies. Understood!? Them... I mean, the corporate companies can you arrange a meeting with them? meeting! Just one meeting. This is our first pre-election party meet. Pandiya, make sure it should be a memorable one. -Hope you understood? -Sure, High Command. Brother, I don't understand. I don't understand the need of this ceremony. That too High Command is coming for it. Pandian is pissed at me party members are laughing at him. Stating, if the seat will be given to him or Kumaran. His intentions are not right. Tell me, what exactly I did wrong? Am I not doing this for the sake of our party? Son, you've become a big shot now. CM himself is scared of you you're well aware of everything. Don't be toying around with me. I beg of you. "The reason, why I took shelter in this Ashram that's not right That isn't Classical Tamizh. doesn't strike the note Son, what are you doing? They're asking me to speak at this meeting. I can't speak with such diction. Why don't say something, let's see how it is. First roll up your mustache. Brother... My name is, Kumaran! I have another name too Are you mimicking 'Baasha"? That's right, not sure if I have to churn punchlines or... If you speak in this manner, people won't agree with you. Why? They do enjoy and appreciate the same in Cinema. Cinema and Politics are not the same. Think from people's perspective witnessing a Hero in Cinema and a Leader who will govern them for 5 years, both have a vast difference. I totally get it, what you're saying But I can't speak in classical Tamizh. Why do you want to speak in classical Tamizh? Whatever comes to your mind at that moment-- --just churn them out. No matter what you do, make sure it's your own. You gotta create a style of your own. Attitude, dressing sense and virtue also your speech should stand out from the crowd. Once you're on stage, people should be mesmerized by you. They should never feel bored of you. Fine! You stay outside. I'll... Brother, you left just 'cause I said so? Son, you've gone beyond the stage to be questioned. Your wish is my command. I'm like your elder brother it's better for me to be enslaved. Oh God, no. Son, unintentionally I blurted it out that I'm your elder brother, please forgive me. Ey...Ey! Come on brother, you have every right. If it's not for you-- --Kumaran is always very grateful. But still, Giri don't repeat that mistake. It's fine now, as we're alone in here. But in front of the people it won't look good. Everything is weird, Vanathi. So far, they've not given us any information. They just stare when you ask them. Kumaran, I'm not sure what they've planned. Please! Please be careful. I don't know what else to say. Something is wrong. On behalf of KMK Political Party at Srivallputtur, an appreciation ceremony for Nandha Gopalan Kumaran is being held Also there's an expectation that he'll be given a post in the party. Ey-- what is it? How long are you planning to sit like this? Looks like you've been possessed. You're not even answering my questions. It's getting late. Don't you have to be at that Ceremony? I was just thinking about it, and you said it. Isn't that a ceremony to appreciate him? It won't look good, if he's late for it. What is it? Come on get up and change. Mother-in-Law, how do I look? Geetha Kumari! Wife of the stupendous Kumaran. Namesake though... Dear! When you speak like that, it hurts dear. Just 'cause those party men invited you're not obligated to go. Ma, how can you be so irresponsible? On stage, I should be beside him as his wife Obviously, his mistress can't think about it mother-in-law. Oh no! Oh no! what if tomorrow, our family image... You're too innocent, mother-in-law. Take a good look at my face. Come on, listen to what I have to say. Take a good look at my face. 'Cause after today, you won't be able to. Get lost, idiot. My dear Geetha, sweetheart, my life Geetha, you too take a good look at my face. Hey, don't mess around with my daughter. Dad, even you take a good look at my face. I did give you guys a chance. Rest is up to you people. Later, you people will regret it. Let's go dear... ...Geetha Kumari! Boss, I've spoken to Kumaran-- --he'll be here sharp at 7pm. We're all set for his welcome. Why are we riding on a cycle? Oh, to make an impression? Fine, speak no more. You look really beautiful under this moonlight. How is it possible to romance two women at the same time? Keep your eyes on the road. Wonder when you'll believe me? Please trust your husband. To advice, first you should live that. 'He's heading towards the market with his wife.' Sir! How do we prepare ourselves, without any information? Mmmm-- not today dear We three usually never get together to do something and during that time, we don't trust anyone. Let everything be within us. It's enough if you do your job. Ey-- go around go through the market come on, go around. Can't you see he's yelling at us? Go through the market. Come on, keep moving. Stop staring and leave. Come on, we're getting late. Get lost! Come on, everyone leave from here. What happened? Pandit, get the car let's take her to the hospital. -Fast! -Ok, Vanathi. This is the current situation of this country. A proof of Chief Minister's atrocious Government. They don't care for the welfare of the people. A stubborn Govt. hungry for position and will die holding on to it. I'm an ordinary votary, who questioned them look at the state of the youngster. Looking at the love the public have on me they were scared I will take over the position they conspired to kill me on my way over here. The knives which charged towards me to kill took a stab at my wife that's how they getaway with their political tactics. And you people shamelessly vote for them. Respected Ladies and Gentlemen also the gathered battalion of youth Vanakkam! Be patient, we'll still have the last weapon to draw. I-- I just have one doubt shall I ask? Hope you won't get offended? Why is it always you people need a nudge for everything? Why do you endure this nonsense, and continue to be slaves? They're literally butchering us. But you people don't seem to bother at all. You don't have to give me a reason I'm well aware of it. Fear! We've been threatened in every manner. Over the time and generations. We're so used to being slaves. If suddenly asked, you people find it hard to change. We didn't use guns to attain our Independence. Gandhiji knew it well he must've thought of it "Come on-- --let's pick up our weapons and take back our freedom" if so no one would've showed up. Let's walk, sit, get hit or kicked let's go on fast these cowards deserve only this method and he knew it back then. Since then, we've never changed. What is the maximum we would do? Even if we are struck by Tsunami Phew! nothing happened to my family. Fine, let's take the TV when we witness others die pity is all we offer "Oh no, so many are dead" "Damn, scams are never ending" What!? "A child was raped and killed." The next day, we'll stuff idlis in our mouth pick up our bags and head to work. In spite of everything, if someone gets down to fight for Independence Put a post on Facebook and attract likes. Did they get arrested? Have they been imprisoned? come on, post 10 comments on whatsapp group. Have we done anything different? Who are you to question this? What right do you have to question? I have all the rights. Farmers who have shed blood and sweat on this land. Workers who are driven for the development of this nation. Being a citizen of India, that's more than enough you have every right to question, The System! Firstly the ones, who don't follow the traffic lights they still jump the signal with ignorance If we ask, they say "Attitude" Just hold them tight and lash them with a whip. "Oh God, no!" Then they'll stop right at the signal. Let's raise our current generation with such discipline. Which will nurture the upcoming generation naturally. Next... They've... Dad... a while ago my parents were burnt alive, while they were inside the house. inside the house My parents-- --sitting there as corpses. Was it the ruling party? or was it my own party? Killivazhuvan? or is it Pichaimuthu? [RAGING CROWD] Pichai! Pichai! Ey-- Start the caravan. The fire we started is haunting us back Ey...! Oh God, no! Fire! Ey-- Ey, it's burning, it's hot. -Brother! -Mmmm Please wear your Veshti. That's really not important right now. Brother, a Tamizhan should never lose his pride. -End of the day... -You're right! ...this stage doesn't belong to any Political party. -It's our party -Let's decide together. This party belongs to people. Makkal Munnetram Kazhagam [People's Development Foundation] MMK! On behalf of Kaka Munnetram Kazhagam the rewarding ceremony which took place in Srivalliputtur the party members attacked the party leader, Pichaimuthu and his associates Sahayam and Ramamurthy and burnt them alive, has created a sensation across the Nation. meanwhile, parents of Nandha Gopala Kumaran... She's alright! Vanathi, what's your next move? See, your future and relationship with Kumaran is like... Some relationships are can't be explained... Savor them until they last. I thought of something but Kumaran now we have to see what he's got on his mind. Few months later... Last week the Election Commission announced the dates for Tamilnadu elections. The two political parties from Tamilnadu, KMK and CJK announced their status on alliance with other parties. Tomorrow there will be a press meet with Nadha Gopalan Kumaran of MMK we can expect some important political decisions to be discussed. Moreover Nandha Gopalan Kumaran... After the sympathetic death of Chief Pichai-- the entire army of the party members after discussing have requested you to take up the responsibility of being the chief of KMK. What's your take on that? If the situation calls for-- --I can't stop that from happening. No matter what, I was born and bred in that party. In order to save the party from a treacherous Ruling party most importantly to save our country this is the prominent way to do it. Can we take it as a yes? "Kumaran is present, wherever the votary are..." Even if the votary from MMK are supporting Nandha Gopalan Kumaran there has been few oppositions too. Let's get to the debate on this topic. Manoj is my friend he was working in a IT company with good salary and posting. Once he started his party-- --hoping he will bring the change in the society and there will be progress in peoples lives. Trusting him, quit his job and joined the party. But he didn't bother and jumped over to the other party. What does Kumaran has to say for those 1000's of youngsters who believed in him? The answer is nothing but reality. If you look at the reality-- --only two parties in Tamilnadu are bound to contest in the elections that's the truth no other party can come into power. So, Kumaran's decision-- --shows that he's a practical person that's the right thing. You're right, Sir. This is an intense Political game. KMK was established 100 years ago they've been in power for 7 times. Kumaran taking up the responsibilities in such a party for that party and for Kumaran, it paved an opportunity for a huge win. Just like I mentioned earlier My name is Nandha Gopalan Kumaran people call me as NGK. Vanakkam, CM Sir. Firstly, congratulations on behalf of our channel. First question for you to be honest our channel has criticized you profusely why did you come forward to us for the first interview? To set an example. I'm not the person, who feels happy with praises. But the person who corrects his mistakes from criticism. You've formed the party on an alliance. Do you think it will sustain? Life is all about believing. My notion to do good for the people there will be always support for that. If not, I'm ready to face another election. Personally the love you have from the people also the leadership of KMK party still without absolute majority, 95 seats Your opinion about that? I will learn. I didn't get it. I will learn. N.G.K Will Rule!
