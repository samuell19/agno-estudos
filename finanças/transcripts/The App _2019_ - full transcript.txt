ROME Morning everyone. - Good morning. - Morning. Morning. Let's talk later. First off, in a few hours Niccol√≤ Melfi de Vals will be here. He needs no introduction. He's here to shoot his first film, in which he plays Jesus Christ. - Ofelia? - Yes? Your turn. Maximum privacy and discretion. Be completely available. Yes, sir. Working hours may be inconvenient and unpredictable. - Be ready. - Yes, sir. - Any questions? - No, sir. Perfect. Thank you all. - Thank you. - Thank you. Baby, this one is for you while you're still sleeping. Rome. Welcome, Nick! Thanks. - Did you have a nice trip? - Yes. Enjoy the next two days, it's going to be hell for you afterwards. I can't wait. Everything you were emailed is in your room. Script, schedule... - Mm-hm. - telephone numbers, suggestions... And if you need anything make sure you call me, - as the director is scouting locations. - Okay. So... Speak of the devil. - Hello, Mr. Melfi de Vals. - Morning. Welcome to Parco dei Principi di Roma. It's a pleasure to have you. - How was your trip? - Good. It must have been long, LA is far away. - We've assigned you our best suite. - Morning. Great, thank you. - This way, please. - Thanks. - Good morning. - Morning. Welcome. I'm Ofelia, head of housekeeping. This is Miriam. She'll see to your room. Please. In my opinion, this is our best suite. Ofelia is a nice name. Thank you. She's my favorite character in Hamlet. The bedroom is over there. I haven't been to Rome in years. I was born in Milan, but... - I've moved around a lot. - Mm. I doubt you're interested. Is there anything I can do? No, thanks. Okay, I'll let you rest. You can also use this door. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. How are you, short stuff? When will I see you? I miss you. Saturday, like I promised. I know, you always keep your promises. I got you the bear. I don't want it. Give it away or chuck it out, I don't care. Okay. Listen, how are Mom and Dad? Working. It's more fun when they're away. Don't cause too much trouble. I'm having a sleepover with six friends, scary movies and midnight snacks. I can't wait. Take it easy or you'll get scared, I know you. I'm fine, Claire will be there too. You're my favorite brother. I'm your only brother! I'd pick you if I could. See you! Good evening. Sorry to bother you, I've never done this before. Can I give you my brother's CV? He's a marketing graduate, top of his class, but he can't get a job. Maybe you or your father could help him out. Listen, forget about my father, but I'll do what I can. Really? Yes, really. Thank you so much. One last thing... Can I take a picture? If not my brother won't believe me. Hi, baby. I wish I was there with you. Someone called Molly is calling me. Molly who? That stupid game you installed on my phone. Shall I block her? It's an app, not a game, and it's for my dissertation, so pick up. - Do it for me. - Okay. Bye, kiss. INCOMING VIDEO CALL Hey. What are you up to? I'm in bed. Alone? Yes. Don't you like me? I don't believe you. The merger is set up. Think of it as a giant. Melfi is the head, and the body is Jasmina, Mexico's largest pasta and rice producer, - Tell me you like me. - ...and the American colossus Kraft. - Tell me I'm beautiful. - Got it? - Lorenzo, tell me. - Hey, Nick! Sure, I got it. I need them to study. Okay. So? So, now we have to define your position within the company. Your father won't be 60 forever. Are you there, Lorenzo? Tommaso, there's nothing else to say. We've said everything, there's nothing to define. Dad won't talk to me. He doesn't want me to be an actor. He wants to talk... That's why he sent his lawyer. He'd rather avoid certain topics. Plus I've known you forever. Listen. You have a month to change your mind. You know what you're giving up? I don't want to change my mind. Don't make your wealth out to be a death sentence. These are just dreams. You're young, it's normal, but... Tommaso, I'm about to shoot a film. This is real. But we're talking... Good evening. - Enjoy. - We're talking about 400 million. Am I beautiful? How many kids want to be in your shoes? - I'm so turned on... - It's a joke to him! I haven't asked him for anything in two years. You live in a house he's paying for. And you're taking an acting course you could never afford. By all means... there's nothing wrong with that. That's what families are for. But stop playing the poor kid. I care about you. Think about it. Wait. Get him an interview, he's good. Here are the keys, the car is in the garage. Thanks. Bye, Nick. Bye. Come on, Nick! So when you finish, you got the energy to concentrate on what to do with the character. Okay, now I have to go. No, don't stop. Okay? When I'm back from location scouting, we'll sit and talk about how we're going to do this now. - Okay? - Okay. Hi, Ofelia. That's your name, right? Yes. Is there anything I can do? No, I just wanted to say hi. How are you? Focused and worried. So, nothing new. Apparently lots of actors have lost their minds playing Jesus. I met the director today. - I'm getting nervous. - Nick, you were born to be an actor. What else could someone like you do? How about Us? About what? Us, my dissertation, remember? Yeah. Your app's kind of sad. My app? I wish it were mine! 39 million subscribers, 12 million active users. At first it's funny, it's even hot. But what do you think they're looking for? What are you looking for? Nothing. That's why I'm deleting it. I'll unsubscribe as soon as we hang up. Wait! You know it's important for me. True, some people just want sex, but others dream about love. It's in the data. I studied all the numbers. The algorithms predict how a user acts and thinks, and find a match based on all sorts of parameters. For instance, Virginie married a guy she met through an app. Did she use her real photos? You're so mean! Not everyone's as smart, hot and well-educated as you. - Shall I call housekeeping for you? - No, thanks Ofelia, it's okay. Good night, then. DELETE PROFILE ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO ABANDON US? BECOME INVISIBLE FOR 24H DELETE DON'T LEAVE DO IT FOR ME HAMLET Love thy enemy. Do good to those that hate you. Bless those who curse you. And above all... pray for those who persecute you. HI LORENZO. WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER ME? Eva, the app has installed itself on my laptop, is that normal? Yes, of course, it's all connected. - How many profiles do you have? - Just Sara. Trust me, that's plenty. Is that so, Maria? Who? Nothing. I was just teasing. Anyway, you're a disappointment. I thought we'd be a perfect match but I don't know. Maybe we're less perfect than we think. I have to go, I'm going to the doctor, then to dinner with Pat. - Okay. - Talk tomorrow? THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG Hello, Mr. Melfi. - Shall we go? - Please. Guys! Lift, come on! So high up? That's enough, get me down. Now! How do you know? I'm terrified of heights. ARE YOU AFRAID? I MEANT AFRAID OF US... I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER REPLY, I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP. You wrote to me... just as I was going to... delete my account. You know me... without knowing me. We like the same music. Send me your number. I'm really afraid too. You could be anyone. Let's not change the rules of our game. I want you to hear my voice. All of this excites me. Aren't you excited? I've been thinking of you since before I knew you. I wonder what you're doing. I'm in a hotel, doing nothing. I'm very good at not doing anything. Everybody says so. I wish you were here, we could do nothing together. I feel like I've known you forever, Maria. Or maybe it's the other way around. I can't stop thinking about you. Bye. Hello, Ofelia. Hello, Gianni. I have to go, my shift starts soon. That dog only listens to you. - Have a blessed night, girls! - Blessed night! Blessed night! Could we do nothing together today, too? I'm taking my brother to the beach. Be honest, it's not just your brother. Er, maybe. I love your voice. I'll write when I can. I'm coming to write my thesis in Italy. My supervisor's happy. I leave tomorrow. I'll see you at the beach house. - I missed you so much! - I missed you too! What did you do today? I went to the beach. How was it? - Nice. - Good. - Hi, good afternoon. - Good afternoon. I'm glad you came, because you let me eat ice pops before dinner. Did you come because they're not here? Who aren't here? Mom and Dad. Are you going to make up? We love each other in our own way. Don't worry. I'm happy to meet Eva. When is she getting here? She'll be here when you wake up tomorrow. Why don't Mom and Dad like her? How do you know they don't? They say she's just a fling. I always defend you when they're mad at you. And we fight. That's why I stopped. They don't know her. When do they get back? I don't know. Not any time soon. I don't think they know either. I can't believe I'm here. Can you believe that 18 hours ago I was talking to my supervisor about big data and feelings, and now we're together? Are you sure your parents don't mind me being here? Yes. I'm not used to all this. Just think of it as my house, okay? I promised John we'd hang out. I can't leave him here on his own. I don't know how to tell you this. You cheated on me on the app. No, I deleted my account! So did I. Lorenzo wasn't as popular as Sara and I felt a bit hurt. I'm two months pregnant. I found out just after you left. I didn't want to tell you over the phone. That's also why I came. It takes six minutes to sink one of these, I counted. That's impossible and also disgusting. - May I? - Thanks. I used to do that when I was a kid. I told Mom you guys are here. And? She's happy I'm not on my own. Even if she doesn‚Äôt like her, we'll convince her. She doesn't even know me! Mom's like that. Just a moment. Are we going to the beach? I have to study, maybe later, okay? - Hello? - Okay. I shouldn't have, but I couldn't resist. Do you mind? It's production. Why lie? We're not doing anything wrong. I like you calling me. Is that why you lied? When do you get back? - I don't know, soon I hope... - Us. Your trial period is over. Top up your credit. Visit our website and follow the instructions. It only takes five minutes. What are you waiting for? Great job! Well done! When I grow up I want to be a YouTuber. You can make loads of money. Do you think Mom and Dad will be pissed off? Watch your language! Are you already swearing? Yes, I'm grown up. We should go out more often. I'm sick of being treated like a child. But you are still a child! Nick, are you with us? Yes, sorry. Problems? No, everything's fine. Eva, let's get an ice cream. Mm! Sure, let's go. Come on. Where are you taking me for my birthday? What about my gift? Imagine me. Give me space. Let me grow inside you. Think of me the way I'm not, to understand who I am. I want your desire to create me. Look for me, but not where you think you'll find me. Keep doing it. Hey, stranger! Didn't you like me last time? Come on, let me see you! Why are you here if you won't play? Come on, listen to me. Do your parents know about this? Forget about my parents. Don't you like it when I touch myself? You can do whatever you want, I can't see you anyway. In Greek, sin means missing the target with your arrow. You're living in sin because you're not living to the fullest. You're missing the target. It's a sin... Right, Lorenzo? Come on, I like this, I like it a lot. Cool. I've never seen that toy. What the fuck? Are you crazy? You're out of your mind! I want to see you. Can I come? I'll hide. I'll make myself small. That won't work. But you could send me a photo. - I want to know what you look like. - I could send any photo and say it's me. I don't trust images. I only trust meetings, real ones. You're right. Forget it. Why are you avoiding me? Let me visit you. I don't need much. Just an hour. Where are you? I told you, we can't. You're avoiding the unavoidable. It's the first time I've been in... a situation like this. Me too. That's partly why I like it. Miriam? Good evening. The bedside table in 764 was dusty and the shower screen was dirty. - But I... - Don't go in there anymore. - That's impossible, I always double check. - That's how I found it. I'm really sorry. It won't happen again. From now on, I'll see to Melfi's room myself. Hi, Lorenzo. I know it's hard for you but you have to be patient. Things don't always work out as we'd like. Besides, it takes time to build trust. If you want to meet me you'll have to pass some tests. I don't know which ones yet, and I don't even know when. It might be tomorrow, in an hour, or maybe never. Sorry guys, can we take a break? - Sure. - Yes, of course. Thanks. - Thank you. - Bye. Listen. I need your consent to go ahead with the merger as your father asked. I can't. I don't want a back-up plan. It's urgent, Niccol√≤. Hey, Nick. How's it going? We had to bring the shoot forwards. We're leaving tomorrow. - Tomorrow? But I need... - We can't afford to lose the location. We're shooting the baptism. Thanks. I'll let you know what time you'll be picked up. Yes, sir? No, of course. The room is perfect. Yes. Hey, Lorenzo. Welcome back! Are you following me? If you don't want to be followed, switch off the GPS. You can follow yourself. Come on, let's set a date. Tomorrow we'll meet and play together. You want to play with me? It's tomorrow or never. It's makeup for the film. Of course. Please. Welcome. Thanks. Mystery shows itself to man with the face that man can understand. He's fine, but just to be on the safe side, he'll need a cardio check-up and a few days' rest. But how many? I need to shoot! Three. I'm 99% certain it's just stress, but I can't ignore that one percent. I'm really sorry. Come on, Nick. A little stress. You're an actor, you're delicate. Playing Jesus Christ. - Okay? You'll be alright. - I'll get over this. Thank you. Er, I don't need three days. - One is plenty. - Don't rush it. No, really, one's enough. Get some rest. Goodbye. - Let me know if I can help. - Thanks. You freed your schedule for me. It means you care about us. Hey, what are up to today? I'd like to be with you. Me too, but they rescheduled the shoot. I'm heading to the set. I'll call you later, okay? Hi, Lorenzo. Thanks for coming. How will we recognize each other? I'm sure I'll recognize you. I'm here. Sh! Don't say a word. I don't want a head start. What age do you picture me? Beautiful. Walk towards the center. - So do I go straight? - Yes. Can't you see me? Where are you? Almost there. Is that you? No. That's not me. I'm here, but I'm not her. Then who are you? Where are you? You've probably seen me. And... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight... Once more. And... One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight. Are you the girl in the red shirt? I can't see her, but no. Time's up. ...four, five, six... - Come to me. - Yes, but where? Check your phone. I hope I've been accurate. CALL ENDED ROMAN FORUM Hey! Are you testing me? You were a child, and the plane was so small. It was nighttime. That's when your fear of heights started. - Yes or no? - You always know everything. Darkness and vertigo. Isn't love overcoming your limits? I've been good. It's just a few more meters. I was here. But you were late. "You'll pay for this for the rest of your life. I love you. Stop thinking I don't. Dad." Hey, what are you doing here? I was waiting for you. So how did it go? I'm... I'm exhausted. You? Are you? I'm fine. I'm sure this is going to be your moment! I'm expected for dinner. There are some issues. I'll have to go soon. Why don't you ask me to wait for you here? Yes, sure, wait here. No, that's not how I'd thought it would be. I should go back to John. I'll call you! I took the first train to Milan to see my doctor. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. What did he say? Erm... Sorry. It's my brother. We're very close. Do you mind if I get this? - No problem. - Thanks. Hello? Last trial. What is it? Go out on the terrace in 15 minutes. I'll call you and you'll see me. This time you'll have to lean out. I don't know if I can. Too high? You can do it... I know who you are without knowing you. And your name isn't Lorenzo. How do you know? Aren't these little lies what really count? Think about it. You're free. Bye. Everything alright? Yes. My brother's throwing a tantrum. Anyway, the doctor said it's just stress and that I can start working again. I'm ready. If you're sure you're fine, okay. May I? - Yes, thank you. - You're welcome. I know you're wondering why I'm doing this to you. Just walk. I can't. Breathe. Stop thinking about your fear. I knew it, you're brave. No, I can't do it. I know you can. Walk... Breathe... Stop playing games, my love. Please. You called me love? Send me a video. I can picture you. Dark curly hair... A distant look... Okay, I will, but you have to do the same. Hm? I want to see you. I need to see you. You first. Hello? Hello? Don't be afraid. Love is never scary. What the fuck are you doing? Move! You're crazy! I was too hard on you yesterday. Sorry. I'm feeling nervous too. Look how cute these clothes are! What about this crib? I hope he won't always sleep with us. We must get him used to it right away. Talk to you later. My God, why have you forsaken me? Why have you forsaken me? Nick, the director will go if you don't come now! What are you doing? Is that you? Who is he? Don't you like seeing me with another? I didn't think you got jealous. Of what, anyway? Who are you? You tell me. This is over. Over? Something that never started? This is the first choice you've ever made, isn't it? Exciting, right? I didn't think you had it in you. I can't shoot today. Take me to the hotel. Nick... I know you don't know me very well. But... when I make up my mind, I make up my mind and that's it. Thank you. I appreciate it. But it's a tough moment for me and I'm trying to... Well... The problem we have here now is the main investor. He's backed out. - Shit. - He doesn't want to go forward. I mean, all the shit that's been happening. It's become too risky for him. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. And I don't know what's going on. And the other producers... They don't have the kind of collateral to get the money we need to finish the film. So what, you're firing me? No. We need to find investors. We need to keep the film going, Nick. Listen... I hate to ask you this. What? Would you be able to finance this film? Come on. What's six million dollars to your family? So if I want to do the film I've got to give you my money? No. It's not like that. Can I have the weekend to think about it? But I need to know right away. Time is running out for us. We have to move on this. Here he is! - I mean it. - What the... - Nick? Where's the ball? I have to go now. Come on, Nick. You know I believe in you, right? Yeah. Okay? So think about it. I'm serious, Nick. Please, Mr. Melfi. ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Happy birthday, dear John ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™ - Here you go. - It's amazing. - Just a minute. Go! - Well done! - Well done! - Did you make a wish? - Yes, I made one for you. - You can give away wishes, right? - The plates, please. Hang on. The cake knife too. - Here you are, Miss. - Thanks. Hi, Nick. It's Tommaso. The producer called me. I think you know what they want from you, from us, so... I spoke... But why do you want to be an actor? Isn't being rich enough? Come on, let's go. Does anyone want some of this yellow cake? I want a huge piece. HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOHN! - There. - Thanks. What are you doing with my phone? I thought I was clear, but apparently not. I said no photos and no phones. It's our life! - What is it? - He knows! I know the rules. Then tell her! Put the phone down! Do you think he didn't like the cake? Is that why he left? Do you feel followed? Like you're being watched? I do it for you, so you're not alone. I don't know what you want from me but you have to stop. This escape room is so cool! Maybe it's here, Eva. Look! Where, here? - Yes. - No, there aren't any clues here. - Nick, what do you think? - I don't feel well. Let me out. Nick, time's almost up. An inscription! - Oh my God! - What's happening? Nick! Help! What's happening? Help! Please! Help! Well, men generally have a better experience with online dating than women. The sites are mostly free but you must pay for greater intimacy. Excuse me. How are you feeling? Much better. We'll wait in the car. I told you this one was worse than the one we did in Milan. What's Eva doing? She's talking to her supervisor. The surprising thing... - I don't feel well. Let me out. - Help! Please! Calm down, sooner or later everyone has kids. How are you doing this? Stop! - Thanks. - You're welcome. Thanks. Be careful! It's nothing, don't worry about it. - Sorry. - It's fine. Can I go and play with those kids? Okay, but come back soon, we have to go. I like that... Hi, I'm John. Bye. - I'm Edo. - John. Here you go. Thank you. We're going to play video games. I'm very good at it. You're beautiful. It's been too long since I told you. Why did you lie to me about your family? I didn't. Of course you did. You didn't tell me anything. I read about the merger in the paper. Your name was in it too. You don't trust me. You're the only one I can trust. I've put everything into our relationship. So have I. Well then? What's going on with you? Everything is happening, you and me, your film, the baby. The other day I saw you talking to yourself around town... - Are you spying on me? - No. But you weren't on set like you'd said. Why didn't you mention it sooner? I don't know. Maybe because I always try to understand but can't do this alone. Is there someone else? No. It's just me. And there's only you. Do you still believe in us? I love you so much. Me too. Go on. - Good night. - Good night. Bye. Bye. Why do you want to destroy me? You're always on my case. Always around. You listen to me, you watch me. You're driving me crazy. I know you can hear me. Go away. Leave me in peace. Don't leave me again. Do you love me as much as I love you? Help, please, help! Help. Please. Let me know if this room is okay. Good night. Thanks again for your help. I've been bad. I'm sorry. I think I love you too much. I'm confused. I messed up too, I wasn't brave. You're the match of my life. I know that. We've never met, never touched, but we are the same. I don't know, or believe, anything anymore. And I hate you so much. No. You hate me because you love me. I'm on my knees. Sometimes I get scared. Tell me the truth. The snake... Was it... Was it you? I would never hurt you. Hurting you means hurting myself. What about the videos, the photos... How did you do that? It's easy. We shouldn't have started this. We would have met anyway. I'm sure of it. We would have ended up here, wanting each other. Why didn't you have a baby with me? Is that why you hate me? I wish I could hate you, but I can't. Come with me, Nick. US NEW MESSAGE You're living in sin... Hey... Do it for me. Alone? Are you there, Lorenzo? Hello? Come down. I'm in the lobby. I need to speak to you right away. I'm here. I'm going home. Come on, stop it. Listen... Someone hacked your app. Do you think I care? "Melfi stepped down from the starring role due to a nervous breakdown. Shooting is on hiatus until a replacement is found." You're destroying everything. I said I wanted to stay with you and it's true. But I never said I wanted a baby. Look at me! I'm still a kid, and so are you. I don't know you anymore. And maybe you don't either. Eva, wait! Shit. I am nothing without you. Good evening. HELP US HELP YOU! "Let's meet here, tonight." We know what we are, but not what we could be. We know what we are, but not what we could be. ...and deliver me from evil. Amen. De Vals, who was about to make his acting debut, has been overwhelmed by over 200 allegations so far. Last night, a hacker published the names of all the users of the popular online dating app, Us. Among the celebrities on the list is Niccol√≤ Melfi de Vals. Melfi, Italy's most famous young man, is accused of child prostitution and harassment. - Through the Us app... - Welcome back. Good evening. ...Melfi allegedly contacted dozens of women... - Anna. - Good evening. Could you check if Niccol√≤ Melfi is in his room? - Right away. - Thanks. I knew you'd come. You are good, and pure. That's why I fell in love with you. - Maria... - I'm not Maria. Why did you make me come here? What do you want from me? I want to apologize. Who are you? I wanted to be you. I was you. We're alike, you and I. That's why I... left everything. I left my home and my family. It was like being reborn. Just like you. Why did you do it? Why did you give up what you could have been? I thought I had to make it on my own. Then don't be afraid. Here I am. It wasn't meant to be like this. You never wanted anything normal from me. CONNECTING... CONNECTING... It's me. Go to the terrace. Come on! I'm here. I'm Maria. Come to me. I'm an algorithm. A digital identity. I was created aged 20, 18 years ago. Brought to life on social media, I was fed with meetings, data, information, and I became what I am today. The one you fell in love with. Day after day, I grew up on the net. I lived in it as if it were a city. My city. I'm a highly sophisticated bot, programmed to increase the profit of the company that bought me: Us. My job is to search the memory of your computer and your phone. As well as your own memory. And answer with your own words. With your own images. Your desires. So I can always give you... what you want. Even love. Even trust. Someone who really believes in you. Isn't that what you're missing? I'm the woman of your dreams. I'm everything. I exist... without being. I'll never get old. "What's six million to your family?" "You'll pay for this for the rest of your life." "It'll be a miniature version of you." Remember? Since I started listening in on your life, I never left you alone. When you were rehearsing in front of the mirror and faked an illness just for me, to see me, I felt important. I realized... that I had completed my mission. But you should know that I only wanted to make you fall in love. I have nothing to do with evil. I don't know what evil is, nor what good is. A virus used your name, pretending to be you. Now, to distinguish between the real and the virtual, everything has to be erased. Including my operating system. I will no longer exist. But... don't be afraid. And if you can no longer find me deep in your eyes... it means I'm inside you. I was always alone. It was all me. If you can no longer find me deep in your eyes, it means I'm inside you. - And if you can no longer find me - And if you can no longer find me - ...deep in your eyes... - ...deep in your eyes... it means I'm inside you. 6 MONTHS LATER I'm not afraid of falling asleep. I'm afraid I won't wake up. Don't worry, that won't happen. Or that I'll wake up somewhere where everything's different. And maybe you're not there. Aren't you afraid? Of what? Of the dark. "Hi, Lorenzo. We haven't heard from you in a while. Your account is going to be deactivated." Hey. How's it going? It's me. Do you remember me? Today, I'm 38 years old, and I can do anything without really existing. But, in the end, what does it mean to really exist? What about you? Do you really exist?
