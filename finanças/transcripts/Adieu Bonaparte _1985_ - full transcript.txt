Come upstairs! Come! No, you come down! But Aly, what are you doing? We don't have to time, I tell you! A huge fleet has arrived! It's dumb... missing such a good opportunity... - Aly! Come here! - There is nothing! Look, France answered to our call. - We were 30 to sign the petition. - 30 and they send 300 boats? In France we are all equal. You annoy one citizen, the whole Republic annoys you! Yehia, get out of here and take your children. Go away, I told you to get out of here! Go now, run after them! You're looking at the sea, but why? Ma ti ekhi ekino? If there are 1.000 men in each boat, there must be 30.000 legends! And one rhyme for each. The Odyssey of Aly Mohieddine! Why not? I can't wait. I put the ladder 4 days ago, so the neighbours get used to it. I sent my father on a journey... and my mother to the market. Why? You're right, congratulations! Let's rush to your room! Grand-ma's sleeping pills'll have lost their effect. Dad will be back from Rosette... and Mom will ask me to peel the vegetables. So, where? Here. You're really crazy! What if the French find us? I'll turn them into pigs! You are Calypso in all her glory! No... Fotini Herodotopoulos. Farewell, Bonaparte Where's Aly? He's praying. Dad, the fleet, this is the French. Forget it, they are to Governor's guests. What about my guests? Dad, the French! He knows. Yehia, you and Aly, go straight to the Great Mosque. Tell the sheikhs we'll gather home. Tell them to wait for me if I'm late. We'll all fight, Dad! I'll reassure the Governor and ask him for arms! - Where's your brother, Aly? - He's praying. Idriss represents the Ottoman State. Only my friendship for you prevent me from beheading you. Your message is shameful! Dear consul, your chief thought about breaking our bonds... to Admiral Idriss, brother and friend of Islam. You think of offering him a draft. And you pretend you're instructed and open-minded! Re-read the end, Idriss, or maybe you, Magallon. You know what's written, you were on the "Orient". It's true, I visited General Bonaparte. The letter says: "You belong to our friend the Sultan." Really, Magallon? France is friend to the Sublime Gate? If your chief wants us to feed its army... he chose the right season! The harvest was abundant, thank God... But if he thinks we'll let him do that... and occupy one inch of our sacred country... he will only prove his ignorance! Yes, sheikh Bakr? "Doesn't it concern us?" I told him. He said: "Keep educating my children..." "and may the people keep calm." "Yes? And who'll fight, the Mamaloukes?" "No conflict with the Mamelouks!" As we say... My brother and me against my cousin... "You accept the Bedouin's help!" my cousin and me against everybody. "And we, Egyptian, do nothing?" Ah, may the French win! How dare you? French are infidels! And Mamelouks are real believers? Anything but live like this! You talk like a traitor! Greed knows no borders... Both will suck us like leeches. Dad, will they occupy Alexandria? Let's go to Cairo! One thousand arrogant Mamelouks and a bunch of Bedouin... The French army will crush them. Go to Cairo? And abandon our parents? The Governor'll think it's a betrayal. Ignore the battle, that's the betrayal! In Cairo, militants are counted by thousands! We'll be beheaded! Better than stagnate in humiliation. French and Mamelouks will fight a bit, negotiate a bit... and finally share the booty. What booty? Will wee still be alive? Let's go to Cairo. No, I'm not going. - You will lead them. - I said no. And I say you will go. Let's wait for tomorrow, Selim. We all have things to settle. What things? Do you want to be stuck here? Maybe they have landed already! What will you do in Cairo? The Bedouin will kill you before you get there! You're betraying us! Deserter!! - You won't hear my speech? - But... What speech? Frenchmen! One more effort if you want to become Republican. He wouldn't understand a thing! Who? Aly? Thanks to me he knows who Racine is. You think it's a flower. Aly, stay. You'll stay, won't you? - My brother... - You can't live when you have to work! Your pregnant sister-in-law won't endure the trip. Your brother is an anarchist! These people come to help you. Here, read! "For too long Mamelouk slaves have been terrorizing that part of the world." "People of Egypt, they will tell you I come to destroy your religion." Read! Don't believe them. Tell them I come to... restore your rights and punish usurpers. And that I respect more than the Mamelouks God, His prophet and Islam! We'll be seen with these lights! General Caffarelli, I can't do better in such conditions. What are you waiting for? A miracle? God! The sea will be calm at dawn. But Nelson... will he be calm too? General Menoux, 22nd light brigade, 13th and 72nd battles. General Kleber, 2nd brigade of infantry, 25th and 15th. The greatest walked on this land: Caesar, Alexander... and above all our great Bonaparte! Get lost! God! General, the outing in Cairo was a failure. And Alexandria? We'll be there before noon. Call for rally! He's crazy! Is he worry about her? She's Christian like them. You're unjust. It's her who's worry about him. Why doesn't Bakr accompany them? I'll come back. I don't care about Cairo. Don't be caught by the Bedouin. Don't fall in French arms! Don't worry. And all of us should fear Mamelouks. They would slit our throats. Slowly, Aly! You shake her too much. She won't give birth, she's in pain because of the smell of the onions. God is great! He is alive! Let's ask to road to the dervish. I won't ask anything. Go straight. "Straight!" That's what you've been saying for 6 days! Leila will give birth "straight" in your cart! He is a charlatan, I'm telling you. God is great! He is alive! The kid will live. You will name him Chaaban. He'll go to Mont Carmel... and 17 times to Mecca. The 18th time he will die amongst his disciples... who always gave him drinks and food... and a bit of cheese, maybe? Sorry, we ate it all. Miserable greedy family! May the fire of Hell burn you! Throw your faces at the ground... and beg God for forgiveness for you insulted one of his saints! Let's go, Aly, hurry up! You will be rugged, bunch of awful disbelievers! Better show us the road to Cairo. It's going between your mother's legs! - The French are already in Cairo? - We'd have met them. - Maybe they went through the desert. - Do you think they are dumb? Water, son of a bitch! I'm dying! A lake! Water! Let's follow them. I'm thirsty too. What a cruel illusion. There is no water. Over there! No, here! Group in squares! - Group in squares! - Group in squares! At my order... Fire! It's a roadblock, let's go back. These are the Chief Commandant orders: Walk! Walk! Let the Generals know that... if you want to gain the influence on the country weapons will never grant you the immediate occupation of holy Cairo... will be an irrefutable signal that the whole Egypt was taken. We're on the border of the Nile, singing Italian songs. Tomorrow we'll eat the greatest vegetables. We'll need Brussels sprouts! Did you see that? Did you? You didn't. He did. He can see. You keep screaming: "Water! Water! Water!" He saw many things. He doesn't look at his ass like you do. You're one to speak, General, you forgot one of your foot in France! Horace, you went through a lot. There's salt if you need some. Suffering is never needed, always inevitable. One have to learn to escape the causes. Be strong-willed, overcome desires, forget sorrow, govern solitude... Things I'll never do. But Bonaparte, he can. Oh I can too. I could. But you're a professional sufferer, and you'll suffer a lot in this country. You won't dare do a thing and you'll suffer and suffer... - You're an idiot! - Yes, Dad. Time to go! Not a single second to suffer! Put it back! Don't you understand Arab? Order from Mourad Bey: requisition of goods needed for the battle. And robbery of everything else! I'm lost, there's too many of you! Fahmi, my brother, arrived with his 2nd wife... his 1st and his 12 kids! Fahmi? Don't know him. Fahmi, Fikri, it doesn't matter! Malediction! Where are you taking this? Woman, go home! If no pantry, woman doesn't go home! Aren't I right, Doreya? True, Abla? Calm down, Aunty. We need to unite and provide for the war. It's fine about rice. But what is the pantry for? What they leave us is only good for rats! Don't worry, Dad will bake us the best bread. It won't be enough! There are more than 20 mouths here... And your wife is pregnant! - I'll name him after your husband. - My husband? May he die! Call your son Bonaparte! We're safe and sound in Cairo. They robbed Aunt Nefissa's house. I'll cook you something. Do you think it's fair they robbed her house? Our house in Alexandria will become "Decoin's storehouses"! - This man taught me to.. - Say: "Yes, sir!". You only belong to your country, your relatives and yourself! Welcome. Are you okay? Why wouldn't she? We almost named to kid Dervish! My husband's name! Why call his son "Dumbass"? How are you, Bakr? Tell him we almost gave birth on the road! Mr Decoin is not like them. He's French, like them. But they'll kill the Mamelouks! And take their place. One occupant after another. May they kill each other before we attack them. Even if we may be killed! What are we doing here? We're here to fight them together. You'll be the first! - Be careful! - Sorry. Let's put a chain in the Nile. Will this stop their fleet? I don't know. At least we'll try. I don't know! At least we'll try! Stop this uproar! Go away! Muslims fight with swords! Not with your yelling and tabors! What? You won't help her to give birth? You had 3 kids, I didn't. You know what to do. You know where they come out from! - You, really... - What? Poor me! 20 years of marriage and nothing! I married dummy! As crazy as her brother. As her whole family. - Except Bakr, you and me. - Alas, Bakr is like his aunt. I don't care about their gossips. - Where are you going? - To fight! Me too, it'll be better than here! Selim! Bakr! Aly! Leila? We're taking care of her. - Did Yehia bring your food? - Don't worry, I'm not hungry. If there's enough for one, there's enough for one hundred. Honour us... Sheikh Bakr Mohieddine. My sister Nahed. She made this delicious rice. Yehia! Come here. Are you crazy? Where's Bakr's food? You go, be kind. Leila is about to give birth. - Did you say it to Bakr? - He's working. Go now! - Together: Egypt is protected... - By the Prophet! - It will fight off.. - The invader! Assault! What are they doing? I'm opening the squares! I want pieces of 12 right now! I need officers! - They are 10 by squares. - I need 20! General Yanski's boat sank in the Nile this morning. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! It couldn't be worse. Contemplate... Contemplate... from up this temple... Citizen Caffarelli... You're a connoisseur, listen to what Bonaparte'll say after he wins the battle. From up this temple, 40 centuries contemplate you. I doubt the General needs your services to find the right words. And he doesn't need to praise the pyramids. When their majesty crush me, I'll right how euphoric I am! Anarchist... I'm fleeing! I don't know you! Give birth under the bombs? Fuck! The Emir, my master and his wife fled at dawn. - If we don't act she'll die! - How sad! They fled, I'm afraid. - Name your price. - Keep your money. If I stop watching this madman for one second... I will lose everything. God! Let's go. Don't forget anything, kid. Where are you going? Not this way! Go straight, you idiot! I'll lose them now! Go to hell, you, your brother, his wife and his bastard! May God burn you! Follow me, poor idiot! May the three... the four of you die! What a stampede! Run for your life! - Bakr, your lunch. - I ate already. Nahed, go home and lock all the doors. I'm staying with you. Go away, hurry up! They are all fleeing! I'm from Alexandria. Do you know Alexandria? Show me your face... just once. I need to know what is around these beautiful eyes. Ah... you blasted me! From here, they look like ants. Who do you think will win? My eldest brother is afraid of Mourad Bey. So it'll be the French. Never! We'll win. My brother, yours, me... Real Egyptians. - Can you fight? - If you're at my side. - I'm a girl. - Each Mamelouk have 3 assistants. Me, your servant? My father was a tax collector. My brother too. No! You load the rifle and I shoot. No way. You fight, you win and you cover me with gold. - We don't fight for money. - So do it for me. No, for the glory. If it's not for me, you're dumb. And I don't like dumb people. - Where do you live? - Home! You're voracious! Give it back! Did you came to give us bread or humiliate us? It's for the fighters. To victory! Hail to Egypt! I live in front of St Georges church. My brother will kill... anyone looking through my window, on the left of the balcony. It happened so suddenly... In a few minutes... A real carnage. The best cavaliers in the world were cut to pieces by the French. Good riddance! And now, you dear Bonaparte... My Frenchmen... My dear Bonaparte... What do you mean? He will destroy Cairo as he burnt everything he touched. Aly, you're a Saint! You saved our lives! May the Prophet spare and save you. My master and his wife were beaten and robbed! - The French? - The Bedouin. Poor Lady! What they did to her his awful! No! You can't do such a thing unless the person agrees. - Be decent, Nefissa! - You know nothing about that subject. Better die home than suffer elsewhere. Suffer? Your sister, an unknown? Be proud that your grand son can be born here! Cairo, pearl of the world! A thousand canons boom to honour it! The chain in the Nile... The swept it! Hope, even fugitive... keep humiliation away from us... and make us combative. Sometimes, Aly, your poetry goes straight to my heart. She gave birth! I made it! All alone! Nobody in the world you do what I did! I'm the only one, unique! Is it true that these monsters will burn our houses? He needed all that noise to be born? - I love! - "I love"? You love? I love without restriction. Without shame! Passionately! Only a cockroach's exaltation could break this sacred place's silence. I understand you. This is an important time. Yes, Commandant. Imagine, dear Louis... From the top of these pyramids, 40 centuries are contemplating you! - He went for it! - What did you say? I was enjoying your sudden inspiration! People of Egypt! We are here only... to deliver you... from the Mamelouks. They are using... us as a pretext to... Peg leg! When do you want a second one? - What did he say? - He wishes you have two... peg legs. - You! Come here! - Let him go to hell. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. Let's start over again. France. Egypt. Mistre. - It doesn't work. - I don't speak French. Impossible! You bake it. What will people say? My father is baking bread for the French! This, bread? Barely taste like it! It's not for them, it's for the neighbourhood. The canons in the citadel too? - I didn't proposed them! - They have to find another one! And stay still? I refused their money. That's no solution. The solution is for me to work. I don't want to become lazy! God willing, Selim! You! Can't you transport something more useful? My brother doesn't speak French. Can you be the interpret? I can speak French but I won't accept money. Ask him if he wants to work. We will pay him. Neither me nor my brother will take money from you. Are you Mamelouks? Are you very rich? Your HQ requisitioned my father to bake your bread. We want him here to bake our bread. - That's enough. - There is a bakery here. Can't he learn to bake with his father instead of roaming in the street? - It's be better for him. - I'll tell him. Tell him now. Yehia! He wants you at the oven with Dad. Only if I can put his body inside it. - He said "Fine". - What's fine? Engineer, I want to breads from this bakery with your report tonight. - Tell them how to send them to me. - Yes, Dad. Come on guys, lift it! - It's as heavy as a camel. - Slowly! Why do you need a special militia? Do you think 80 savants will be enough to convince them of our good intentions? What's this? Bonaparte! The Sultan knows better than you that his people is primitive. What about you? I was born here. You're a primitive too! You may go. Here is the door. He said you have to leave. Everything is here. Even the bread. They didn't want to give it to me. The want "the man in blue". Here is the exit. Is that guy more important than Bonaparte? Why doesn't he listen to me? Kids, come up here! Watch your fairy's hands. These are fragile tools. Fragile... and heavier than a camel. Here they are. - You go. - Talk to me, I'll translate. Yehia. - The Chief Commandant is waiting for us. - Make up an excuse. I won't go to the cinema with him. I'll remain a noble and a catholic. Amen. Shops are open again. We buy, we sell... People are laughing, they forgot... as if nothing happened! Bonaparte wrote a letter proving... his respect for Islam and its Prophet. There are rats everywhere. "Where's your master's money? You'll have half." He claims to be a Christian but dethroned his chief: the Pope! Bonaparte loves Islam. You taught me principles, honesty. Where's your piety? Where are your advices? They force my father to bake their bread. My brothers are their packmen. They have taken my father's soul and my brother's hearts. Fear started to invade me. Our leader will sign the Firman they ask for. "People of Egypt, submit." "Bonaparte respects your religion." Frenchmen are armed... Might is right. In the name of God the Merciful... "You, believers, do not obey to infidels." "You will get lost and lose everything." Thus spoke God the Almighty. What are you looking for? Words? Advices? When words are not understood anymore... The stick must be used. This is the one I have. You'll have to find more. They are 40.000 soldiers. During the battle of Badr, 300 Muslims defeated 3.000 infidels. Their hearts were united... They were one burst! Fighters... not speakers! Toward Mecca two pigeons flew. How happy! After their journey, they saw our beloved Prophet. Where is Caffarelli? Unsurprising! He doesn't seem to have good priorities. He must come to see me. Your state's serenity is matchless. - One day we'll walk on these planets! - You'll bring soldiers and canons there? Soldiers, bakers, umbrellas sellers, even idiots like you. - Idiots cannot speak French. - You'd be surprised to know good they do! During the equinox it's has big as your head. - Equinix? - Equinox. Write it down. E-Q-U... I-N-O... X... not K-S. And E. You, smart ass, translate for him. He has to understand how fascinating it is. Come! How do you say "Come" in Arab? Two R, not one. Come and hold this. Look. Something else, even better. Tell him you, the Egyptians, invented this. We invented this before them. - It's... - Fascinating. S-C. It's a wonder for us men. So many victories... To win without risk is to triumph without glory. - Racine! - Corneille. - You seems easily downhearted. - I won't regret anything but death. See? And I write better things in Arab. - Really? - Yes. - I don't speak Arab. - Someday you will. Urgent. From the HQ. I'm bored. It's the same thing everyday. Look... it's mine. - I wrote it in Arab. - What for? Instead of my reciting, they can read it. Reciting is more beautiful. But I don't like it at all. Tell him I won't come anymore. You tell him yourself. I wrote it. God! You used the machine for your writings? It can only be used for the Chief Commandant's proclamations. - I will only add 2 of my lines. - Nothing but that! - I barely dare to print my name. - I dare a lot. Nelson too. God, it's a catastrophe! Are you okay? I'm fine. I have nothing to do with the fleet. It was in Aboukir! There is barely a forth of it left, Sir Decoin. The maritime road is non-operable. Sir Decoin talks to respectable and non respectable persons. Sir Decoin says: "Today, the grain is more expensive." - This is not so good. - The fleet sank? 40.000 persons are prisoners here. Now you know everything. Now you now too much. This is not so good. I don't like war profiteers. Our fleet sank in Aboukir. So be it. We have no choice but to achieve great things. And we will. We will found a great empire. We will found it. Egypt shone more than once in history. From Alexander to Caesar, they all found here an immortal glory. You will soon be proud to have revived a nation the whole world begrudges. A nation the whole world begrudges... A nation the whole world envies! Tomorrow, I want from you, glorious children of revolution, this unique great impulse from your hearts and souls than can create... immortal achievements. It shall be our eternal testimony of the nobleness of our venture. We will found an institute, beloved child of our genius Caffarelli. We will pursue our civilizing mission, main reason of our expedition. Caffarelli will like this. Call my commandants. It's horrible. You have to see that with your own eyes. I'm disappointed. From Balbes to Salaya... nothing but battles. This is not a promenade. This is very serious. - Something happened to the child? - No, Dad. To our civilizing mission. He told people Nelson burnt the fleet. Everybody knows that. Take him to the infirmary. Are you Barthélémy? Head of the militia and friend of France. Tomorrow, I want from you, glorious children of revolution, this impulse from your hearts and souls than can create immortal achievements. It shall be our eternal testimony of the nobleness of our venture. We will found an institute, beloved child of our genius Caffarelli. We will pursue our civilizing mission, main reason of our expedition. Gentlemen... We're also staying here because we have no other choice. Perfect. If we have no choice, let's stay here. French merchants also asked to be heard. Go see them, my dear Louis. Tranquillize them. Tell them nothing can stop me from fulfilling my duty. They shall be with us tomorrow for the celebration. Impeccable, General. The fiancée of the Nile. Beautiful, antique tradition. - The celebration? - Celebration of abundance, of joy. Not a single inhabitant of Cairo shall miss it. It's the people's celebration. Overtake Boulak garrison with a few sticks? That was your advice! Why are you so late? Here are the arms. 23 rifles and 100 bullets! Isaac managed to trick the sentinel. - 20 rifles against an army? - No, 23 rifles! The Cadi is hiding arms. We must find them. - Anybody saw you come in here? - Who cares? I do! Yesterday, the pretexted a search to steal everything! Let's hurry! Is it cooking or war? - Wait for two days. - Here? I won't wait. French are desperate, we have to strike! Don't be so impetuous! More people want to join you. Who? It's always tomorrow, later... I'm going! Even if I'm alone! Bring a lamp to enlighten your mind! Stop playing, Yehia. I have to go home. I'm coming. Sing, sweetheart, your ode to beauty And dance Dance all over the world Your happiness may last until tomorrow Every day offers us a thousand divine hopes O quintessence! I'm in love with love And the whispering of love in your eyes And the sighing suitor And the tear drop as an avowal And the trembling young breast May I be the loved one Or may I die O quintessence! - This Yehia is a pyromaniac, he loves fire. - I love it too. You love being burnt. - Who is that? - Yehia's friend. If I'm late my brother will stab me! Aly, ask the lady... Will she be present for the Chief Commandant's party? He's inviting you to the celebration. She'll regret it. Let's go! - You're bringing the child? - That's what the commandant said. The people's celebration! You came to deliver us upon our merciful God's order! How childish, this Caffarelli! How can he forget? Better laugh about it, Horace. The victory is yours and the Nile has never been no beautiful! My turn! Look. This is the time. Let's do it now. Calm down, Capitano! You'll frighten the guests. What? Guests? There are only two Egyptians and they are dressed like French. Our compatriots want to see the Chief Commandant. Here. He's perfect. And he's taller than him. Go. - What if he really shows up? - At this time? He's writing. Ladies and gentlemen, the Chief Commandant! Ladies and gentlemen, the Chief Commandant! What are you watering, Saneya? Water as much as you want, a rotten seed will never sprout! If they need wood to heat them up... they can gather the remains of their boats in Aboukir! So small pieces, poor ones! "Get away!" How can they pull out our doors? Thieves probably work with them! One more step and I fire! - Don't you trust them? - You're French and they betrayed you! Things have changed since Aboukir. - The mercenaries are ruining everything. - I didn't hire them! I've been looking for you for 6 days! Why are you mad at me? I brought the petition! It sent executioners! Executioners? Titine taught you that word? - Leave Mrs Decoin out of it. - She's French too! Here is my fellow after his disappearance. No wonder why the General is looking for you everywhere. He went to the bakery and bought bread himself! People were looking at his medals. But I'm still a General! Bakr doesn't want him to work for you anymore. I'm leaving too. Why? What did I do to you? Admiral Bourier suffered an edifying death! While Admiral Jotoum's death is moving. A nine year-old child... a hero. All of you. You are all heroes. Just tell me what's the problem, Aly. Be honest. The dog... A massacre. - It was a threat to the soldiers. - It belonged to someone! - They had to keep it inside - How? You pulled out all the doors! - We feel naked. - Hygiene matter! They took the carpets in Nahed's house. Hygiene matter too? - Do you think I gave the orders? - You didn't try to stop them. General Caffarelli, I'm the victim of Barthélémy. - I'm almost this child's father. - Me too. Run after him if you feel like it. What should I do? Slaughter him? They robbed us! I'd slaughter his father too! When the donkey is strong, aim to its saddle. - He's still a friend. - A friend? He's French! You know, if each Egyptian kills a French, it would be over in one day. You still work for them? Tomorrow, we'll fight. We have arms. As many as them? Look. Each tract will convince two men. Do you have friends? - Yes we are a group. - Do they have brothers? - A dozen each. - Bring them here tonight. I'll hit the ones who refuses. And fight aimlessly? Why not? I'm like "peg leg", a General, or better! Yes... Bonaparte! Go find your friends. What if Bakr hear about it? Our elder'd say... "Go, young lions, you are perfect!" Egypt, rise up! Egyptian, rise up! Let's fight together... and build a free and strong Egypt. After the first prayer, let's gather at Hag Azouz, near the watering place. - Hello, French. How is your kid? - Go to hell. Thank you Sir, you too. They aren't even ten.& Even if we had arms, could we handle them? We are your men. - The city is eery this morning, General. - Some fanatics. I called Dupuis. 10 tens before all the people and garrisons around receive flour. We will see. Bakr, Sheikh Hassouna is with us! Hail, Holy War! God is great! Arms, Cadi, arms! Let's break in the armory! Barthélémy, bastard! The people will kill you! Faltaos, where are you going? Arms first! Let's stay here! Arms first! Let's go! Beak through the door! The traitor! He emptied it! He took everything... but these! Take aim! Fire! Are you bowing before Barthélémy? He is a collaborator! Together: "Egypt! My life! May I die if I forget you!" Repeat, Yehia, repeat! Egypt! My life! May I die if I forget you! Watch out Aly! He's aiming at you! - What happened? - Sheikh Charaf! It's incredible! Retreat! Even the French abandoned... So do we! Retreat! General! General! General! General! General! General Dupuis is dead. We needed fortifications, not windmills! It was a mistake to be confused about priorities! Help! They are bombing the mosque of El Ashar! Sheikh Hassouna! They are bombing El Azhar! They pretend to respect Islam but strike at its heart. You go to the garrison! What are you doing here? Your 2 brothers are in the street, isn't it enough? Barthélémy is robbing and setting fires! Go home! At my command! Fire! The books! The books! The books are burning! Vandals! Vandals! Vandals! Selim's bakery is burning! Nobody can resist Barthélémy the Greek! Burn! Burn everything! - Where did you take this? - From "peg leg". You thief! Animals... They are animals. This is a massacre... There is no hope! Until the last breath! Leave me alone! I am right. I'm right. Yehia... Yehia. Windmills first. Why? Why? Why? You're right... I am a general after all. If you knew how lonely a general is. Do you know how a general fights it? Being silent. Becoming studious, or even intelligent. He demands, he fights, he kills... For the rights. The rights people have, their freedom. He can become intelligent. But a loser. It was worth it. A few broken tools for great victory. Your heart has to be intelligent to understand that. Still... you don't know what you missed. 1.000... 10.000 men! Say: "Egypt! My life!" "May I die if I forget you!" - You're speaking Arabic... - I speak from my heart. See, if you had one... You would understand. Have a sit. I want to understand. Yehia, let's go. I will always be baking bread! - You're heartless. - My heart? It won't feed you! - Leila, I'll be back. - When? Where? I don't know. Yehia will find me soon. Yehia? No way! Your brother won't leave this place! You scared me! I thought it was the French! No, I'm on guard. Where is he going? One comes, one goes... What's happening to us? We can't discuss reasonably anymore! "Peg leg" humiliated us. Sheikh Charaf is in jail. It'll be our turn soon. Me, your brother, maybe even Faltaos. We have no protector. God is your protector. Not a single arm at Cadi's. Intentions, but no plans. How can we win? Neither you nor the French can teach me a lesson. Why fight each other instead of fighting together? Let him be... He never knew his true friends. My friends, I chose them amongst my relatives! Don't you touch me again, ever! "Egypt, may I die if I forget you!" Who said that, Bakr? Wasn't it your brother? Follow your path, I'll find mine. And you, Sir Faltaos, you remain silent? A wounded face and you think you did your duty! Listen to me. If you think you can blame Aly for your defeat... Be careful! This is really mean! They want bread but can't bake. Aly is the wisest. We fought, we loved each other. After love, we cried. Gentlemen... I asked the president of our institute, our savant colleague Mr Monge... that our meeting extraordinary takes place here... so as to admire how the French genius turns dreams into reality. A reality that will metamorphose the whole world. Mr Contet, you have our attention and our unconditional admiration. The real balloon will be ready in a few hours. Tonight, I will have 10.000 little flags made. We'll throw them from the balloon. - Splendid! - A bit of France in every corner... Fascinating. S and C. - Good idea, Bernoyer. - And canons to protect our positions. Our positions will be sure when you finish the fortifications, Caffarelli. - El Kazouny is a mosque! - It's disused. - This is our Commandant view. - Just repeat it, don't interpret! I'm here. Allow me to make my own choices. So what are we doing here? Here you are Marcel! I asked the librarian to bring to the institute... some of the new printed Egyptian newspapers. - This may be a piece of history someday! - Why don't we take one for history? Citizen Caffarelli seems to have a suggestion. They have three. Let's bring one pyramid to Paris! It'll be our eternal glory! Why not your statue, Sir Caffarelli? A wooden one. Egypt is not enough. Now they want to occupy the sky. Is Caffarelli ignoring us or is he lost in the crowd? Hasn't this word been banned since the revolution? Aly wants to get on this inflated things! He wants to throw tracts from up there. - Tracts, Aly? - Of course! What a pain, this Aly. Sir Marcel! Hold it tight! On the left! Hold the rope better! Why did you disappear?! I never fooled you! This is... dumb and spiritless! I always took care of your education! Lady Titine too. I trusted you and I end up a madman looking for your in this circus! It's the first time I see you dressed like a civilian. With this outfit I look more like a beggar. You know, I have never begged. You are absolutely free to disappear! Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Idiot! Anyway we're leaving for Suez tomorrow. I'm not available tonight. I have a meeting. I didn't dare tell Nefissa I don't eat Nile fish. We'll go back to Alexandria tomorrow. And abandon Bakr? He brought us here. He'll find his way. Yehia is going with us. And Aly? In Cairo, he gets along well. We'll leave tomorrow. Look! It's really flying! Why, God? This will never take us home. We'll never see our families anymore. Neither France... nor our relatives. - Toulon is pretty far to go swimming. - My eyes hurt so much! This is hell. - I'd like to pray. Is there anybody? - You're free to do it. If the king knew that, Isabelle Isabelle, if the king knew that You would never wear a lace dress again Isabelle, if the king knew that Too bad. A few more meters and it would have disappeared behind the mountain. - People'd have said it went up to the sky. - Who cares about what people say? It's a failure. Period. Everybody is sulking: the French because of the balloon, Dad because he does nothing, Mom because Dad is sad, and Bakr think the French beat us. Sir Marcel, your work was not good at all. You and Aly too? We, we make problems disappear. The French, every time they have a problem... a firework! Fire... work... Yehia! Yehia! Get away! You are not welcome here anymore! He's my brother! Nobody can separate us! Yehia! Don't abandon me! Yehia, take me with you! The coffin is empty! Mom, he went up to the sky! Leave me! Leave me! Run! Barthélémy set up a trap! Take this. God, how we loved you! One day, you will come back, when things get better. Everybody will go back home. The landlady paid the dime and Aly will be welcome in our house. Bakr has his ideas. But you know he loves you. He's obsessed with you. Understand him. Be patient. Promise me you will visit Yehia every Thursdays. Don't forget him for the Prophet's celebration! The gates of the Sky will be open that night. Promise me. Go greet your father. Poor father... In two days and one night, he lost three sons! Tell that to your general! He loved him more than a son. You had understood that. A real passion. Caffarelli always use this word... Passionately. - Is passion greater than love? - It's suicidal. All the intentions were edifying. All the results were disastrous. A dumb accident. No, it was inevitable. Violence was all around him. I assume my responsibility. Knowing the stone found in Rosetta... could let hearts communicate 4.000 years away... When, for me... 4 minutes away from you are unbearable. But... you are no more, Aly. I have nothing but you... Only you can hear... the silence of my solitude. I need to share yours. Make Mediterranean sea meet the Red Sea... How ambitious. The road to India... What a chimera. You are the last one... who is able to hear... the silence of my solitude. Did we come here to die like the Pharaohs? No! Leave me... Leave me alone! Let me die in peace! For God's sake, go away! Go away! Let me die in peace! Sheikh Charaf Salem. Sheikh Mahmoud Abd-el Bassek. At my command! Fire! Turn right! Walk! You think we're alone, infidels? We are hundreds... thousands! - He saved your life. - He thinks he can humiliate me? You are not at easy with yourself. Presents... I don't want this. He needs you for his campaign to Syria. I won't go. You're crazy. - I understand you pain, but... - You're Nordic, you'll melt. It is supposed to ease your pain? Too easy. You're still unfit? Enchanting, this Caffarelli! - Easily forgettable. - Nordic! I won't. Every time my stomach aches. Mediterranean... They chase each others, kiss each others, fight each others... He was enlightening the dusk of my existence. He is dead. Maybe, but it will never end. We are bound to each other. He has the same gestures, the same looks. Aly? Are you talking about Aly? "It will never end..." Listen, Caffarelli... He needed a father. You were a cheater. A possessive cheater. Learn to love them less. It's possible, you know. It's even a better love. You profiteer, coming to extort a favor. A friend begging for a favor. A friend? To what extent? To the extent of not caring about people who... are discrediting me. Saying you are...? - A collaborator. - Why not my lover? That too. But you are not. We can only be enemies. Admit you are ashamed. You said it. You are enduring... calmly, the accusations. So what? What you felt for Yehia wasn't love. Love for a person. It was passion. Maybe even a desire to succumb to your instinct. No, it was love. Love cannot easily be forgotten. It lasts a lifetime. What about me? Love. For both of us? How does a French think? I don't know who is who anymore. You're a speaker, but he was... Your body? No... You too? Your body?! Stop thinking I'm debauched! You and him are only one. Because he is dead. Asshole! - I'm the only one left! - Pretentious! I can love 10, 100... Why not? You too can. You love your father, your mother, Nefissa, Bakr, fucking Alexandria... - And many more! - But each differently! Me too, differently! Would you force me to something I don't want? How would you call that? A ransom. You're like Bakr. Might is right. - Do you see canons here? - A guillotine. - Who taught you this world? - The revolution! It's Titine! Your mistress! Sade taught you French. That's how you learned. What an ecstasy! Bastard! Stop acting like a virgin. You shouldn't be surprised anymore. It does when it comes from you. Conquests, abuses, rapes... First, the country, the houses... Then us. It won't happen. Listen. Even if I wanted to... I couldn't. To me... It's very important. Maybe. But for Yehia and me... It's different. I'm just hurting you. Maybe I should roll away. Forever. Aly! Don't expect anything! I will wait. Martin! Martin! To the citadel. - I don't owe you anything. - Go away! Go away. After all... you're a general. Farewell, Bonaparte. Your benediction, Madam, I beg you! Not you, unfortunate face! But you... and you too! Do you dislike us that much? Hope? You're selling lies! They need them so much they believe them, darling! Beauty is very expensive! But hope even more! Come work for me. You will be surprised. Let's sell dreams and chimeras together. "Come, wretch. Come near, you who are frustrated." "I'm a hope dealer. And hope is very expensive." Some of them were hiding, because of pudor. Then they would wade into us, hands full of money. The end of dignity... "Me first! No, me! Me!" Hope dealer! Weird hope! - Bakr joined the Mamelouks. - And Faltaos is in a convent. - Who's in charge of us? - Ourselves. One of another. - Do you have the strength? - Do you? I am hungry. I want to eat. Good! I'll cook an omelet. Don't move. Your foot are full of mud. Mud from our land. From Rosetta to Belbeis. We went to 500 villages. Ashes and despair everywhere. So, the witch was right. I'm completely lost. But I understood they all capitulated. Now, I just want them to leave me alone. Let me tell you... Nobody exists... but you. As soon as I see you, catch sight of you... My heart stars beating. This means I'm alive, right? Me too. - I didn't say anything. - You said "Me too". You heard it, so why ask. My heart beats so hard it dazes me. - Go tell everybody! - I didn't hear anything! "Death and ashes"... Go away. The tracts, who printed them? Your heart is beating. "Egypt.." "May I die..." It was yours? Wasn't it useless? No, your heart is beating. We have to get ready to fight the enemy. They are in troubles too. More than us. The printer told me... Bonaparte in St Jean d'Acre. Half of his army got killed. He doesn't care. You know everything! He lost his mind. Sheikh Hassouna agrees with me. You met him before I did! "Peg leg" is wounded too. He'll die. His arm got jagged. He only has one leg and one arm left. What a strange guy. Is your friend with or against us? Violence is everywhere. We spread it. A surprising man... courageous. He feels so guilty... Let's not blame him for Yehia's death. The one who doesn't try to avoid trivial mistakes... prepares himself to greater sins. I love you. I owe you everything. There is an assault. None of our comrades will survive the massacre. Catastrophe! He will find a way to pretend it was a victory. These poor persons. I seduced ans dragged them! Why? To be killed in their shanties? Tell him, General! Eternity is staying alive in people's hearts! It's not building monuments with their blood! Prestige, Commandant... Better retreat with dignity. - Tell him, General! - Shut up! This battle is useless. Let's admit it! - We need to secure our borders. - Human mind knows no border. - Enough, strong enough! - We have to punish the Mamelouks. By slaughtering Egyptians and Syrians? You and your colleagues, you enlighten them... What a joke! Just like the balloon! What a failure! - You want to live through people... - They don't want that. - The glory of France... - It's about yours! Corporal Lattienne. General Boor. Dead. Chambaux, Fuseau... 600 men! Horace. My admirable Horace... They are all dead. The glory of France... We leave behind us a siege of suffering. No, Caffarelli. Maybe they do, but you don't. Aly... It was difficult to come here. There are ashes. Ashes everywhere. All the beauties of the world can come out a spark. And another one can turn them into ashes. You are more attractive, Aly. Are you in love? Alexandrine? We moved in near your house. This is from her. Yehia once told her you love dates. You... Did you tell her? She loves you as much as we do. You are surprising persons. - United you could achieve great things. - Together, we would be better. Fight? Until the last of them is gone. What do you mean? You would pay a high price. I had a good teacher. You are too humble, master. Until the end. Until the end. Aly... Aly! Shake my hand. I love you less, Aly. But way better. Farewell. Farewell, Caffarelli. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG
