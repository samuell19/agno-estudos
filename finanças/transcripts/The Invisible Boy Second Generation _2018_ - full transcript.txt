The city is preparing to inaugurate the pipeline which will link the East to Europe. Igor Zavarov, the president of GazGlobe, is also awaited the Russian company that dominates the market. Hi Michi, you still sleep but I wanted to say hello, so I took your phone... Do not worry, I have not read the messages. Today is your birthday, turn sixteen... Happy Birthday to You... When you leave the house take a look at the garage. I promised you, right? It's not really the latest model, but it's a nice scooter, - Meanwhile... - Happy birthday to you... Hello, my love, see you later. Hi Michi, you still sleep but I wanted to say hello, so I took your phone... Do not worry, I have not read the messages. Today is your birthday, turn sixteen... When you leave the house, take a look at the garage. I promised you, right? Let me talk, do you understand? I was summoned by the principal the third time this year. You always say the same things. You took another three from the math question. Nine to the written. The average is six, I think. Why do you always have a silent scene at the oral offices? I am shy? Michele, I'm tired. I worked all night. I can not take it anymore, it's a difficult time. Can not you help me? Why do not you commit a little more? What does it cost you? And it costs you so much not break my balls? Oh! But what a way to talk! Do you really want to piss me off? Michele! Every night I have the same dream. And then I wake up thinking that it's not true. I visit her whenever I can. I'll let her hear her music. I talk to you. Or at least I try. It is then that I feel stupid to speak alone. Only that... I do not believe that the last thing I told you is not to break my balls. Michele, we have already talked about it during the other sessions. You do not have to blame yourself. It was a stroke of sleep. Sure... Why should it be my fault? I could not save her. But what could you have done? You do not have to ask too much of yourself, basically you're just a boy, Michele. Social workers say that in spite of everything, you do it very well. I do not know if it makes sense to continue to come here. Listen Michele, you "must" come here. Three times a week. Remember what the judge told you. You'll see that talking to me will do you good, thanks. My mother is dead, my father is gone, I'm alone in the world and there's nothing that can make me feel better. There will be someone you love. I think I fell in love with you. Maybe it was when I found out that you saved me. I did what anyone would do. Can you tell me again how it went? So maybe memory comes back to me. So you were fainted, I picked you up. One of the kidnappers tried to stop me, but I punched him... With me in my arms? On the bridge there was another one, but with a kick I threw it into the sea. I put you on the pier and then there was the explosion. Gentlemen, make your game. Games are made. Twenty one red. Always wear it under your clothes and consider it as a gift from your mother. My eyes do not see you, but our minds are always in touch. I'm your father, I'll always know when you need me. Now I need you. Who were you talking to? You knock ever, eh? I went to see you. Are you still very sad? Giovanna misses me too. Do you know what is the most annoying thing? Who never knew who I really am. I had to tell him. But superheroes can not tell anyone! Yes, "superhero". You're the Invisible Boy, you also have a second power, you told me. I do not wanna talk about it. You blew the submarine with a shock wave! Candle! I said I do not want to talk about it! Superheroes do not exist. If as a human being I could choose everything by myself, first I would like the return of the father. Thus says Telemachus, the son of Ulysses. So he told you he saved you too. Yes. But he does not want anyone to know. You know, it's very humble. Sorry for the inconvenience. Guys, I want to introduce you to your new classmate. Introduce yourself. Natasha. Guys. Hi, Natasha. Good, good work. - Hi, I'm... - I do not care. We said that from now on Telemaco is no longer a teenager. You come to her party tonight? No I do not think so. Right during the festival Telemachus and Ulysses they take their revenge on those who have usurped their power. I think I'm coming to the party. Silence! It's from a lot that we do not see each other! - What do you do? - Work. Mica lose time at school for free as you losers. I'm a driver, and I'm better than Hamilton, I've never had an accident. God, I'm sorry! I forgot about your mother, what the fuck! Hei, Silence! Hei! Silence, how come you're the only one who does not have fun? Always better than pretend, like you do. I broke pretend. Hello. Michi! I did not believe you were coming. - Why? - You're not a party type. And what kind are they? I never understood it. Silence! Go, there's the open bar. Let it out! You'll see how I vent in a little while. Hi beautiful, where do you run away? You are busy? They are demanding. Wait, come on! You must not touch me! I just wanted to thank you on behalf of Brando for coming. Brando is a special person. Come on, Silenzi. It's not the case. Well, you're a hero, are not you? The heroes must celebrate them. Do you remember the story of the kidnapped boys three years ago? It was he who saved them not? Why do not you come here and tell it to everyone? Enough, please, you're drunk. Do not you want to come? You know... He is "humble". Michele, come on, stop. Or maybe it's not that he does not want to say it. Maybe he does not even know what happened. What the fuck are you saying, Silence? And do you know why he does not remember? Because he did not save them. Come, let it go. - Brando? - Leave me alone. Star! Watch me. Stella, it was me... Can I know what happened? You were about to die burned. Yeah, the fire... Quiet. Nobody has hurt himself. The blonde is safe. You were going to make a big bullshit because of you. Normal people must never know of our powers. What are you talking about? For months I hear you say how special you are. But it does not seem to me. I'm leaving. It was not a nice shirt. Who are you? It's your sister, Michele. I am your mother. No. I do not believe it. Misha, look at me. Mom, you know you do not have to do it. Can I hug you? I've been waiting for sixteen years. You have used your power too often lately. I'm already better. No, I'm sorry, you can not use it for a while. Dr. K, the only normal we can trust. Dad was also sick when he used power. It's the problem of us Specials. Dad told me you were dead. There was little lack. He did not even tell me about her. I do not know what to tell you. He promised me he would be with you. I've been looking for it for years. Maybe now I discovered something. You know where? Has been kidnapped. That's why he has not made himself alive. Do you know who kidnapped him? PRESIDENT OF GAZGLOBE He is seizing all the other Specials. Why? He has always wanted to discover the secret of our mutation. He tortured us for years. He wants our powers. Even at the cost of making us die. And what can we do? We have to save them, right? We are the only ones who can do it. Natasha? But as Dr. K says, I am too weak to participate in the action alone. - I need you. - Action? Which? We have to kidnap Igor Zavarov. And how? He will come here in five days, for the inauguration of his pipeline. And when did we kidnap that we do it? In your opinion? We ask that our people be freed in exchange, no? So, Misha? Are you ready to use your power to save your father? But it's beautiful, it's home, it's big. Do you live alone? Yup. So I'll see you tomorrow at school. Yup. Then bye. Yup. See you later then? Hello. Listen, but the other day at the party, what did you want to tell me? I do not remember. We see that it was not important. Everything changes under pressure. You know about the new pipeline, which will be inaugurated in our city. In your opinion, how does gas travel in the pipes? In form... liquid. Because of the high pressure. As inside the tank of a lighter. At this point, in contact with the oxygen contained in the air just a little spark is enough and... Fire! Calm, guys. Get out of the classroom, calm down! What have you done? Mom has to talk to you. And you need to start a fire to tell me? She does not like to wait. Come on let's go. No physical contact. It's very important, Michele. I would do it but I'm too weak to remain invisible all that time. What should I do? You must steal Zavarov's security plans. Where is it? How did you do? Did you copy? - No! - Yes, you copied. - No! - Yup. - No Yes. - No. - This way. Zavarov lands on Saturday at 13:45. The entire route is at risk of attacks, therefore maximum alert. For surveillance along the way you must coordinate with Lobanowsky, head of the GazGlobe security service. Mr. Quaestor, excuse me, but... A civilian? Former colonel of the Soviet Army and head of the secret services for a fairly sufficient time managing the security of a country of almost 300 million inhabitants. On the other hand, how are you doing on the battlefield? From 2:40 pm there will be welcome speeches by the authorities and the performance of the gym team. At 3:30 pm Zavarov will turn the tap, starting the new national supply. Will the gas start from Piazza Unità d'Italia? No. The central hub is here. We call it the Boiler. It is the central unit that distributes the gas to the whole city. Now please deliver the file where you will find all the details. I'll take it. Do not trust the Italian police? Dr. Zavarov gave very precise instructions. Nobody can get hold of this information. I had the network card removed. The computer stays here, and nobody comes in here. Now we can sit outside. You are welcome. Come on come on come on... Italian police. Did not you make it? It's true? Zavarov will be escorted by an armored car and two police cars. From the airport you will pass by this road which will be closed to traffic. The gallery. This is where we will attack. And how? As soon as Zavarov's car enters the tunnel, Natasha will create a wall of fire by trapping them inside. At that point, you and you Misha, from invisible, will disarm security. But is not it dangerous? I'll protect you. I'm your mother. We have the same blood. We are one, nobody will ever separate us anymore. To our powerful future. As we say, there are no ugly women, there is little vodka! Are we going to a rotisserie? Do I get roast chicken and chips? I'm not so hungry. Me neither. Can we have a beer? Michele! We did not introduce ourselves. I'm the one who designed your suit. I'm Boris Knyazev. But your mother calls me Dr. K. Is it very bad, my mother? Yes, his blood does not have enough red blood cells. But now you are there. You and your sister are all you need to feel good, of you and your blood. Come, let's go to your mother. Get me a curiosity, Misha. How did you sink a submarine full of armed men, all alone? One thing happened. I do not know. A drop in pressure, I think. I entered the rescue capsule just in time. I see. Who knows how Dad is. We'll see him again soon. The superhero? But you're just stupid. And why not, sorry? I had a superpower, I had just saved everyone. I thought, maybe I can help someone else! And then? Here there are never bank robberies, car chases, I do not know. The only thing I did with my power was to correct my homework in class. I was talking about this one that day with my mother. The day when... Since then, I have not cared for anything at all. I know what it means. What are those scars? That asshole of Youssouf, the brother of the woman I was entrusted with. I ended up living with him when she died. Youssouf drank, and when he drank he raised his hands. He beat me. My cigarettes were extinguishing. He said I was not worth anything, and that since he fed me, I had to repay him. And then at night he entered my room. And I discovered my power. And I bet he discovered it too. I hated you, do you know? The only time you were in danger, our father ran right away to save you. Instead he left me. And now you still hate me? Do you like that one? And what a problem there is. Go, go, go, go! Sorry! Very beautifull. My first theft, who knows what my mother would say. Which one? What are you doing? Do not you put it? It's not for me. All right, I... I go. Excuse me, why do you come back to your house? Sleep with us, right? Do as you wish. Good morning, Misha. Dobreudra. I made you coffee. Do you drink it? Yup. Thanks Mom. You know that here you can say anything. This no. This no. This is the last time I come. Why? Because I do not need it anymore. Mom, this is for you. What's this? A gift! For my part and for Michele. It's beautiful. Thank you, my treasures. I do not take it anymore. Two days are missing for the big event. As the city is buzzing, curiosity rises around Igor Zavarov. But who is this gentleman? Igor Zavarov, this € 15 billion lord? There will be consequences. They will chase us all. And here there is nothing left for you. If you have to say goodbye to someone, do it now. Quite right. And we'll see each other tomorrow. But where are you going? I'm leaving, Candle, with my real mother and my sister. Are they as special as you? Will you do the superheroes? OK then. Then... Hello. Goodbye. My love. That day I lost you I was desperate because I did not know if I would ever see you again but happy because you had managed to escape. Two second-generation Specials free for the world. But then things got worse. Katia! What happens? It's a great day, here's what happens. Good, good girls! So I want you tomorrow! Come here for a moment. During the inauguration of the pipeline we will have the whole city to see us, print and television, we must be perfect, understood? Well, let's go from the beginning? In position. Hello Star. Mum? Mum? You too were lost in the world. I had to come and get you one by one. They have imprisoned us for years. They used us as guinea pigs, they tortured us, but that's enough. Now we are healed, and we control our powers. Just run away. Just make the life of thieves, escape, hide. Time has come to fight. But why do not we stay on the original plan? Yes, indeed. Let's take it, let's get the money and goodbye. No. Our real enemy is the normal. Are not you tired of being treated like monsters? Rock, the strongest man in the world, how many humiliating jobs forced you to do? Kinetics, how many times have they put you in jail? Do you remember Katia? The little rubber band, those bastards made it die! And you? My little Natasha... What would they have done to you if I did not come to rescue you? Alone, sick, marginalized, this was. But now, everything has changed. Now we are united. And powerful. Dr. K has prepared an explosive mixture. Natasha will have to drill a 10 cm thick silicon carbide wall. Then Dr. K will insert his mixture into the pipeline, that liquid is our detonator. When the gas arrives at the inauguration place, Natasha's fire will do the rest. A few seconds... And bum. Zavarov will burn. And with him all the other Normals. We are stronger than them, right? We are Specials! Yup. Yup. Yup! The world will discover whose true power it is. She's crazy, she wants to kill them all. I have to do something, Natasha agrees with her. Where are you going? I need to go to the toilet. I do not believe it, he lied to me all the time. I do not believe it, he lied to me. He lied to me all the time. She's crazy, she wants to kill them all, I have to do something. Michele? Show yourself, I know you are there. How do you know I'm here? Hi, I just arrived. Do you know where mom is? I have to go and call the police. My brother is here. He wants to betray us! It was not Zavarov who kidnapped the Specials, you told me a lot of bullshit. Is not this what you dreamed of? A group of Superheroes. But which superheroes? You are only murderers. So you'll have time to think about who you really want to be. One of us, or one of them. You can not do it without me. You can not use your power, you're too weak. Not anymore. See Misha, you and your sister are second generation Specials. The only ones who do not get sick using their power. By combining your genes, Dr. K managed to find the cure. To do this we had to modify our DNA. Dr. K invented a machine for this. He called her Uterus. An appropriate name. Because I was born again in there. I healed. We are all Specials. Thanks to Natasha and you. And this would be your way of thanking me? You wanted to betray us Misha, for now you will be here, good, then we'll see what to do with you. You're a monster! Monsters are the Normal! Natasha! I do not believe you agree with her. Natasha! Natasha! Good morning, Michele. Goodnight, Michele. Are you sure, mom? Why do not we do what we decided at the beginning? Now we are too strong to be content. Go get the keys to the van. Now do you give me one too? But when does the bus arrive? But that's Ivan! But then you give me the photo? Sorry for the delay, girls. I was doing nice for you. But do you have a driving license? That is the only exam I have passed. Vamonos! Michele. Michele. Michele... Michele... Michele, can you hear me? Michele, it's Andrej. Pope? Are you okay? Dad, where are you? But you're here! I've always been closed in here. It was she who kidnapped me, just like the other Specials. He tried until the last to let me participate in his plan, I have refused and here I am, he used your DNA to become more powerful but something happened inside her, it's like a dog that has been kept too long in a cage! And what time is it able to... To do what? I read something in his mind, Michele. What? One thing that concerns you. It's right that you know it. Why do not you commit a little more? What does it cost you? It's too expensive for you not to break my balls? But is this the way to talk is this? But do you really want to piss me off? Michi? It is a difficult age. It is no longer a child. But he is not yet a man. How I wanted to see him grow up. Who are you? You were good with him, really. So good that when I sent someone to pick him, he chose you. Not his real mother. He will always choose me. This is what should not happen anymore. Oh, fuck, no! Michele, we have to stop it. And where does it come from? What an asshole. Fucking does this? - Oh, fuck. - Ivan, what did you do? Oh God, you've invested it! This side is not there! Not even from this one. Parts, parts! It does not work! It does not work! It's wrong, it's not right! What a fuck... Should not there be gymnastics girls? We contacted her but still no answer. Try again. - Everything good? - Sure! Very well. - But do you really want to steal it? - You can drive, do not you? The scooter yes, I do not know this. Mount, come on. Daddy I do not know how to tell you, but... You're blind. Thanks for reminding me. And anyway it is said to be blind. Look at the road! I can only do it if I see it in your mind! At the control unit, it is there that they will hit. Focus on the road, do not think about anything else, you have no idea what it means to live by feeling people's thoughts. I had to stay away from everyone. Look at the road! Curve to the right! If you want to try and stop them, it is important that you know who your opponents are. Natasha is incredibly powerful and can now read even in thoughts. As for Yelena, you must forget that she is your mother. There will be no scruples to hurt you. Here we are. Boris Antonov, known as the Rock, has the strength of ten men. Rock 'n roll, brothers! On the other hand it is not very intelligent. Then there is Irina Pietrova. They called it Kinetics. He can move objects with thought. And then there is Piot, called Morpheus. Thief of jewels and wanted by the police of half of Europe. A glance is enough for him... Yes I know. I've already dealt with him. Look at the road! This is a call for the 70 Specials that are out there in the world. Hidden, persecuted, treated differently. It's time to come out into the open. We have found the cure, we can heal you. You will be strong, you will be free. The whole world must know that we exist and that we no longer want to be submissive. To others, to Normals. When this video is released, you will understand that the world will no longer be the same. Because now we are there, the specials, we are the evolution of the species, and evolution is never painless. If your mother is evil you are too, because she is a part of you. It's that part that triggers your second power. And it's very powerful, that's why it scares you. What if I can not control it? We all have to deal with our dark side. It is called becoming adults. So, are you ready? Pump activated. Estimated time for the saturation of the conduit? Seven minutes. From now. The gas will arrive in the square in eight minutes. Yelena! Andrej. Yelenushka, do not do it. There is always time to stop. "Yelenushka"... This time I'll read them, my thoughts. You are thinking that I have changed, that what you knew no longer exists. You're right to be afraid of me. No! No, Rock! No! Here you are. Here's how he did sink the submarine. Finished the petrol? Stay back! Stella, wake up! Help us! And now Michele, stay good or your friends die. Help! You're not normal. Help! You must always have a plan B, listen to your mother. You are right. General, there are two minutes left before the mixture arrives. No, Natasha. You can not stand against me. People will die! Do you really want to kill innocent people? Are you also like that crazy mother? Is that how you are? Stop that! I thought I was different. Show yourself, you coward! You're my sister, I do not want to hurt you. You try it, brother. You're better than... General, we must proceed! Natasha, it's up to you. Natasha, I know you hear from me. Do not do it. Natasha, no! Natasha, Natasha! Natasha. We have to do it, there's no more time. Stand up. Natasha, listen to me. Read in his mind, look who he is. Do you know what he did to me? He killed Giovanna, my foster mother. What's wrong with you? He read your thoughts. You are scared. You're afraid I do not do it. You only want to get revenge, you're ready to kill us if we do not obey you. You do not care about us, you came for us just because we needed you. Just because you needed to heal. It is not true, I love you, you are my children! Now I see only hatred and anger. Now enough Natasha, ignite that gas. You do not give orders to me. You are just children. Stop them! Yelena! Yelena! We have an outstanding account with Mr. Zavarov. You see that you are a superhero! Candle... please. It was you, it was always you. Stella, you do not have to tell anyone what you saw, invent something. It will be our secret. Michele? Natasha... Let's get out of here. We are new orphans, Misha. And he. Rock 'n' roll brothers!
