PRESENTED BY ALL ORIGINAL ATTRIBUTES OF THIS FILM WERE PRESERVED DURING REMASTERING WHICH WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY DELIVER US FROM EVIL Hi! How are you? André, long time no see! - What's up? - Not much, as usual. You should get a job. It would help you. Should I ask Charles? He's already offered to help. Tell your husband I can fend for myself. As you wish. Have you seen Mom and Dad lately? No, it's been weeks. - And you? - A few day ago, but— Where's Georges? He'll be back soon. He's in the boss's office. He'll be on vacation Saturday. Is that why you want to see him? I want to know where he wants to go. You should leave him alone. - Leave him alone? - Yes, stop chasing him. How are you, sweetie? Here's where we can go for the holidays. Take your pick. Yeah! Miami, Florida, Bermuda, Los Angeles! Anyone care to travel to those parts? I'm not interested! - Not the Laurentians again? - No! - Not to Brome Lake? - No! I'll tell you where I want to go for those two weeks. He wants to go alone! - Georges! - Yes, André? What do you want, my sweet? Stop fooling around. It's not funny. Poor sweetheart! Look at him. He's always around me. Like a moth, a louse. A leech. A leech. - Good night! - Yes, good night. - Things will get hot here! - Wouldn't want to miss it! - What are you doing tonight? - I've a date. Don't ever do that again, Georges. Or I'll have to kill you. Oh, you'd kill me? How, may I ask? I don't know. But one day, I'm sure I will. You and your plans! But I know you… Good night, madam! Listen, André, you know how I suffered over him? I was crazy about him. I can tell you. I even saw Georges often after my marriage. I wasn't over him. I went as far as to bring him home. He wanted me to say I regretted marrying Charles. But now, it's over, for good. And I feel much better. You should get away from him too. Leave him… if you still can. He's always around me. Like a moth, a louse. A leech. A leech… He's always around me. BUT ANDRÉ INSISTS. SO MUCH THAT A FEW DAYS LATER, THEY GO ON HOLIDAYS TOGETHER. You still want to kill me? When you do, do it quickly, I hate to suffer. What's wrong, André? Are you angry at me? What's wrong? You won't talk to me? Here we are, sir! Do I book two rooms? Book ten, if you want. - Good evening, sir. - Two rooms, please. Do you have a reservation? Miss! Don't forget, for the gentleman… always two pillows, clean sheets every night. No wool blankets, he can't stand them. He's allergic to dust, even to women! That's it, two rooms. If I had the guts to get rid of him… You again! A double cognac. Would you rather have gone somewhere else? I don't know… South? To the seashore? The sea? Nothing duller! Nothing more boring! Always the same tune, the same old song. A wave, another wave, then another. An annoying old whore! No, I'd have liked to go to the Rockies. It would have been different. Mountain climbing, I've been dreaming of it forever. - It must be exciting, no? - Sure, Georges, but— You couldn't. You get dizzy on a stepladder! You're such a klutz, my poor André! - I'd try. - Come on! You couldn't even climb Mount Royal! Waiter, another double cognac! Poor guy, he's not feeling well! The party's been organized for our members to mark the Holidays. Look at the sky's asshole! Poets will never understand the stars! Magnificent fireworks will light up the sky right after the torchlight descent. There they are. They've started their descent. It's magnificent! We invite you to have drinks at a discount after the fireworks. The show is grandiose! The skiers are now midway down the slope. I'm alone tonight with my sorrow. I've lost hope… In my heavy heart I'm alone tonight With my sorrow I've lost hope of ever seeing you again Come with me. Let's burn the house down. We'll just leave two small mounds of cold ash. You'll see! We'll fly over Quebec! High above Quebec, you'll see! While lounging about, we'll go see the holy city of New York. Then, we'll fly to Mexico and… Then, to impress Soviet scientists… we'll go up and settle on Planet Venus. Then, with the Venus de Milo, we'll see the glow of the Earth and we'll go to Mars also. From there, we'll send messages of peace and friendship. Then, we'll come back. We'll return to Earth. We'll see how the gentle earthlings have managed with their little problems. - I'll take care of it. - Last warning! It's okay. We'll go back to bed. We'll see how Lucille manages with her charming notary. "How beautiful you are, my beloved! "How delicious! "Our bed is but greenery! "Like the apple tree amid an orchard, "thus is my beloved among young men. "In his warm shadow, I sat, "and his fruit is soft to my palate!" Dog! Bad Christian, listen! God is speaking! "I hear my beloved, here he is, "leaping over mountains, bounding up the hills. "My beloved is like a gazelle, "a young fawn! "Get up, my beloved, my beautiful. "Come, my dove landing in the cracks of the rock, "in the hollow of the steep face. "Show me your face. "Let me hear your voice, so soft and charming. "My beloved raises his voice and tells me, "‘Come, my beloved, my beautiful! Come! "‘The winter is over. no more rain. "‘On earth, flowers are blossoming!' "So, my beloved is mine, and I'm his. "And his herd is grazing amid the lilies. "Before the day gets cooler "and the dark vanishes, "come back, be like…" Let's leave. Let's go. What's wrong? Are you sick? No, I'm fine. You want me to tell you what's wrong? It's simple and complicated at once. I'm bored. It's awful. I'm bored to a point you can't understand. That's all, André. I'm disgusted. I've had it. I don't feel like doing anything. If I could just end it… What if we spent the rest of the night here? Are you crazy? Do you know how much it costs? Never mind the money. Did you ever wonder if I minded seeing you pay for everything? Please, don't start that. "Please, Georges!" Idiot! I'm fed up seeing you waste your money on rubbish. Seeing you be exploited like an imbecile! That's what you are, an imbecile! Aren't you ashamed? Think of what I suffered, what I had to eat in my miserable life. You have no conscience, no scruples, no tact. You call yourself Christian, a Catholic on top of that! You go to mass every Sunday? You'd never miss your mass! - You have your rosary on you! - Stop it! "Georges, stop it." Idiot! Can't you see? What were you thinking? It's not true. I love luxury. I like you to spend lavishly. I find it soothing. It's fair for the rich to pay for the poor like me! I'm happy every time you waste your money. You're surprised? Well, that's the way it is. The sooner you're bankrupt, the sooner I'll be rid of you. Leave if you're not happy! Goodbye! Georges, don't go! Come! - You're having fun? - Yes, of course. - You didn't come alone? - No, with a friend. - Can we invite you tonight? - No, I'm sorry. - I have a date. - Too bad! We could have had fun together. - Another time? - Surely, madam. - Mr. Dastous, how are you? - Very well, thank you. - And you? - Very well, thank you. - You're with Mr. Langis? - Yes, I am. - Say hello to him for me. - I will. - Your parents are well? - Yes, very well. Pay my respects to your mother. - Happy with the service, sir? - Yes, thank you. - Does the room suit you? - Perfectly, thank you. Let me know if you need anything else. - We'll accommodate. - Thank you. You didn't like our duck à l'orange? Yes, but… - Will you have dessert? - No, thank you. A liqueur, sir? Cognac or coffee? No, thank you. Perfect! - You're spoiling me! One more? - One more. Fine. Standing up, perhaps? You mean… Well… yes… - Here! - Like this? It's beautiful! Chin up! - Another! - Again? Lower. Turn a bit… - Like this? - Move your hand. My God, what will I do? Like this! Don't move. Perfect! André, aren't you fed up? Aren't you ashamed? I work for my money. I'll photograph her nude in her room. My first nude. - You're wasting your time! - So what? I'd rather waste it like that than with you. Would you rather spend the rest of our holidays elsewhere? But, my poor fellow, you'd still be there. Come here! Come! We'll dance! Pressed against each other, like two Siamese kittens. - It'll piss off the girls. - Idiot! Listen, Georges, your antics no longer make me laugh. It's crazy. Insane! You're just a weakling, a coward, a sad sack. You're afraid to be yourself. That's what I hate about you. Play the snob without me! He no longer wants me. He won't have me anymore. My dear Georges… I finally understand. I'll vanish from your life. Don't dramatize. It's ridiculous. And now, the final act. Go ahead. You don't have a choice. What pleasure you give me! Hurry up, do it quickly! Good riddance! Finally, I'll be able to breathe, to live, without you following me. Thank you. Do you really think Georges would kill himself? Georges, kill himself? No, I don't think so. Well, I don't know. Read. My dear old Norma, take pride in having been the last woman I loved. You know how much. I've finally reached the end of my tether. You won't be the most pitied. I'm leaving a friend more dejected than you. You know him. It's my last car ride. Goodbye, Norma. What do you think? Don't worry. I could show you a collection of such letters. Listen, André. We never know. If I told you he told me… How can I explain it to you? I've known many fools, but I don't think… It's serious. I feel it. You can't fool a woman! Find out for yourself what a fool he's made of you. I'm no longer amused! - He took my car. Lend me yours! - You're crazy! I can see you don't really love him. Monster! You're a monster! - Are you from Montreal? - Yes. I'm looking for a friend. Would it be Georges Langis? Yes, it is. We're also looking for him. His brother's been killed in a car accident. "A little blood. "Just enough to wash my sail. "A coal is my guiding star. "My dead are at the prow. "A mast is my scaffold. "The wind, my shroud. "I gave my soul to the pilot so he'd take it to Satan! "A hanged man is a good lookout "when hell is our haven." Thank you. Thank you! Here's more rubbish: With sovereign detachment. "I blew out the last glimmer "of our troubled lighthouse. "A stairway of ruins leads "to the stronghold of oblivion. "A memory has become a burning wound. "I walk under the seas towards this net "strong enough to bring me back to the surface of a new era "on the boat of naïve beliefs." Thank you! I don't know where I am! Since the beginning of our vacation… I've felt like getting drunk, hurting someone, everybody. If you'd seen in what state I left that woman at the hotel! Completely lost. Crazier than me. I'm worthless. I'm nothing. - Wouldn't it better to end it? - Don't talk nonsense. I remember Lucille saying that in spite of your madness, you needed to feel loved. Don't bother me about Lucille! She's no better than the others. - Georges… - "Georges. Poor Georges!" Poor imbecile! Lucille loves me. If I show up, she'll fall into my arms. - You're wrong! - You'll see if I'm wrong. - What will you do? - Will you stop pestering me? You'll see what will happen. If you ever dare— Go away, I can't stand you anymore! Your brother's been killed. A car accident. - I don't care! - This is ridiculous. Stop! Don't you understand I've had it with you? Don't follow me anymore. I'll kill you if you do. I don't want to see or hear you ever again! THEY RETURNED FROM THEIR VACATION SEPARATELY. AND SINCE THEN… She's great. Congratulations. Cigarette? Helena's precious. You'll understand when I tell you her father is Stan Stewart. You know? Stewart, textiles. Mr. Dastous… telephone. - Hello? - It's me. - Who's "me"? - Your sister Lucille. - Hi, how are you? - Come over right away. It's serious. It's about Georges. - Georges? - Yes. - Are you coming? - Yes, I'm coming! Hi. Follow me. Don't make noise. You'll wake up the children. - And Charles? - He's away for a few days. Go, I'll join you. Listen. Wake up! Georges is coming. He wrote me a letter to tell me he was coming. - Are you listening? - Yes, yes. I'll read it to you. "My dear old friend, "You remember what you promised me in May last year? "Your wedding dress. "I'll get back to that dress. I'm fond of it." "You were crazy, you cried. You admitted to our pain. "You remember? You said it, you also. "Everybody's pain. Yes, long life." You crushed it and cried. I'm not telling you any more. When I get to your place, I'll collect your white dress. I'll make it my standard, a flag of unconditional surrender. I'll wave it galloping on Parents Street— in the district of Marriages of Convenience. André will be my squire. He's so intelligent. In fact, I know André is close by. He'll start flooding you with virtuous warnings. I want you to know he's not acting in your best interest. He doesn't want to protect you, no. All the bad things he said or will say about me, he invents. He does it only to better betray you. In any case, I'll come tonight to collect the dress, which I'm so fond of. Yes, André, he came. He was as gentle as a lamb. He was crying, and lamenting loudly. He talked about the weather, the years gone by… and the moments of happiness we spent together. André organized trips for three to better watch me. Faraway trips, cruises… where at the last minute, he'd tell me… you couldn't come, that you were sick. Your mother would hide you at an aunt's in the countryside. They managed to convince you to marry Charles. Then he talked about nothing, his nightmares, his sleepless nights. He looked like a kid who'd been up to no good. Lucille, I'm bored! I'm terribly bored! You don't want to know how much. It's a dreadful pain. There's nothing worse in the world. I'm bored to death! He was shy, André. He put a Bach record on your old phonograph. I could have died for him, just to see him smile. I couldn't do otherwise. And he didn't smile. He remained sad. I kept looking at him. I wanted to make him happy. I told you, André. I undressed her. She was impassive like a dead woman. I swear to you… I said nothing, did nothing. I was embarrassed. All that smouldered in us like a volcano. It was terrible. Quite beautiful. She gave me everything. And then, I refused her. I humiliated her. Poor imbecile! I made fun of her and left. Shit! André, open up! I brought back your music. I came on a motorbike with a kid in a leather jacket. He thought he'd scare me. He shouted, "Are you scared?" I answered, "Go faster, faster!" Where were you? At Lucille's. - You saw Lucille? - Oh no, don't start! You won't stand between us again. I saw her. She saw me too. Did she ever see me! She couldn't stop looking at me. So much that at one point, I told her, "Close your eyes, it'll be better." She didn't stop looking at me… crying. Poor André, you miss everything. It's her… Lucille. She's looking for me. I forbid you to answer. I'm warning you, if you answer, I'll punch you! Things are bad, André. Your sister loves me too much. Do you love her? You know very well I never managed to love anyone. I'm leaving, André. Tell her… Explain to her… that she can't rely on a bastard like me. Bye! Mrs. Lucille Leblanc, please. She's not here. Is there a message? No, thank you. How was he? Drunk. I saw him get into a cab. It's terrible, André, I still love him. I'm going to his place. Come in. I was expecting you. Sit down. André, I've been thinking. I've decided to change. I found out what pains me. When I was young, I took myself for a god, a genius. I'm not alone, you'll tell me. Many others did also. But with me, it was serious. As I realized I wasn't different from the others, I dug my heels in. I cursed society, life, fate. I held the world responsible for my failures. And you encouraged my lies. You applauded my fits. It harmed me, a lot. Now, I want to become somebody without fussing, hitting, swearing or drinking. It'll be hard, I know. You'll have to help me. I'm fed up with writing adaptations and translating for American magazines. I want to start my own paper. I need money, lots of money to achieve a dream I've had for 15 years. How much? Well, $10,000 right now. You can't imagine what it means to me. I'm sorry, but I've also decided to change my life. I've also been thinking. I wrote to my dad this morning and asked him to cut me off, which means I'm out of money. - You're not serious? - I'm very serious. I'd sell everything rather than go back to living off my dad. Do you have any esteem for my life? Listen, André, I'll tell you something once for all. You're just a little wretch. You did everything to prevent me from becoming somebody. You were always scared of me achieving anything. You did everything to separate me from Lucille. - You're speaking out of anger. - No, I'm fed up. You don't know how fed up I am. - What time is it? - It's 8:00. - What date are we? - March 30. Well, on March 30, at 8:00, you saw Georges for the last time. Here, keep this for me, a little memento, a symbol of your impotence, your lack of courage, your uselessness, your cowardice! - All that over money! - It's not a matter of money! I just bought our plane tickets. Meet Helena Stewart. Soon to be Mrs. Langis. What? We're getting married next week, then leaving for the Caribbean. I want to get rid of somebody who hates me. - $2,000. - No matter. - When? - Tomorrow night. Do you have a preference as to how? None. Arrange to meet him on Mount Royal and it'll be done. I want to be there. Fine, we'll pick you up at 9:45. May I speak to Georges, please? One moment, please. It's me. I need to talk to you. It's urgent. About what? I can't tell you over the phone, it's too important. Okay, come over! - It's personal. - Okay! Could you meet me on the belvedere right now? OK, but hurry up. Careful, he's not alone. OK, they're gone. You're too much of a sissy to do it yourself? Well, you made up my mind! No, Georges! No! I just killed Georges. AMEN THIS FILM WAS RESTORED IN JULY 2016 Subtitling by MELS
