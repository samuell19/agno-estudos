Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Why do you keep staring at me today? No reason. I’m looking at you normally. Sorry, it’s my fault. I was with the English teacher. No worries. I've never seen this one. You like it? I just got it. I ordered it from an American website. It's really nice. Thanks. We were on autumn break and the boys had come over to watch a movie. I can’t remember what it was, but we laughed a lot. Once the movie was over, we wanted to take a stroll. Outside my house, there were police cars with the lights turned on. There was a body on the ground, lying under a sheet. One of the policemen told us that two young men had fought with knives. That’s when I found the name for our band: Knife Fight. I chose this name in memory of the young men who died outside my house. When I ran it past the boys, they accepted on the spot. They thought it was sick. I've been looking for you. You're acting weird today. I lied earlier. - I wasn't with the English teacher. - Who were you with? The guidance counselor. That's not a lie. Whether you’re with the teacher or the counselor, it’s the same thing to us. Not to me. Because with the guidance counselor we talk about my future. Talking about my future makes me anxious. That's why I'm this way now. What way? Withdrawn. Like I'm a lesser version of myself. I don't want to think about next year. I feel sick just thinking about it. Usually I can’t wait for the summer but this year I'm dreading it. We all know it's over for the band because Laetitia's moving to Paris. We're acting like it's not going to happen. I don’t want to think about who I should become. I don’t want to stop practicing every night with you guys. Come on, you'll see. Next year will be fun. My favorite bit's coming up. Shit, I missed it. It's just after this. When the guy says "sun". I still remember the first time I heard your voice. Naël and I saw your ad on our way to the bakery. It said you were a singer looking for a band. I even thought your handwriting was beautiful. I called you that same night and fell in love with your voice. Your voice was like caramel. A warm feeling in my ear. Not too soft, not too harsh. The prettiest color. A golden voice to shine at night. I still remember the first time I saw you. Naël and I were waiting. You opened the door and introduced yourself. Ever since that day I love you. I've never had the guts to tell you and I lose courage every day. It's as if something stops me each time we practice. You're annoying, Laetitia. Every part of you I discover makes me love you even more. The skin behind your ear, the hairs in your mouth. Your spittle. Your tears of laughter. Even when you sleep in an awkward position and it gives you a double chin. Even then, I think you're to die for. Sometimes I wonder if you cast a spell on me. And that one day I'll wake up and find you boring. I can't wait for that moment. Roca! Laeti! What are you doing? The hell were you up to? I was playing her a song I like. What was it? Sun. When are you going to tell her? Tell her what? Don't try that with me, I know you too well. You’re not very subtle. You stare at her like you’re trying to learn her by heart. You have to tell her Roca, or you'll regret it forever. It’s not the end of the world if you get rejected. You'll be sad for two weeks. Or two months. Maybe longer, but it'll pass. Then you can fall in love again. Whereas if you keep this love to yourself You'll end up stuck. You have to tell her, Roca. You have to tell her before she leaves. What do you think they’re talking about? I don't know. Boy stuff? What did you do today? I was at the library. I’m reading books in Spanish for my test. What are you reading about? The Umayyads. They’re a dynasty who came to Spain in the 8th century. At first they had emirates. Then they grew really powerful and founded a caliphate. But I'm mostly focusing on the city of Saragossa. What about you? I went shopping with my mom. She wants to buy me a suitcase. You'll come visit us next year, right? Boys, come here! Stand side by side. Naël you stand there, and Roca right here. I'm sending it to you now. So if any of you miss me next year send me this picture and I'll come over, OK? Ready? Subtitles by Amos Levin :) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
