Five more minutes, Computer. Warning, ship entering a meteor shower. What? Computer, repeat. Warning, ship entering a meteor shower. A meteor shower? That's what I said. Perhaps a visit to the ship's infirmary for a hearing test is needed. My ears are fine, Computer. Whoa, so are my eyes! Computer, take evasive action. Warning, critical hit. Oh, what are we gonna do? I have initiated wake up protocol. Wait, no, don't wake up the captain. And why not? Captain Ace, Arcee! You're awake. What's going on? Well, I was taking a quick nap and this media shower came out of nowhere and... Oh. Arcee, can you get us outta this mess? On it. I'm sorry, I really messed up. It's okay, Hex. We'll get through this. Look, a shooting star. Yeah, that's 'cause there's a big meteor shower tonight. I know that, but how did you know that? I may have taken a peek at your star site. You did, did you? So this was planned? Well, I figured this would be the perfect way to start our summer in our new house. You are so sweet. Isn't this amazing, Sam? Wow. I haven't actually seen that many stars in the sky before. That's 'cause you've never been out of the city. Look, another shooting star! Make a wish, honey. Really? Of course. I wish that we could all spend the summer back home in the city. Buddy, we're spending the summer here so that your mom can do her research. I know. I wish someone would empty the trailer for me tomorrow. Mom, you said your wish, so now that one's not gonna come true. Actually, bud, that wish probably will. What's your wish, Dad? Not gonna tell you guys. Isn't this place the best? You know, I used to come here growing up with Grandma and Grandpa, looking at these same stars and exploring the woods. Dad, you don't go outside. I totally go outside. Okay, I'm going inside. The mosquitoes are biting. They're not biting me. Ow, all right, I'm out. I told you this was a bad idea. This is a great idea! Come on, Cassie, bedtime. I wish that I can make some new friends. Whoa, just missed that one. Almost there. Come on. Yes! You did it! Watch out! Hex, thank you. Don't mention it. Oh, that's not good. All this damage caused an explosion in the power core. Meaning? Meaning we are about to crash. Initiating emergency landing protocol. Buckle yourselves in. I'm going to attempt an emergency landing on that planet over there. Computer, can you gimme a rundown on that planet please? Planet 2224. Third planet from this system's sun, known to the inhabitants as Earth. Population 7.8 billion of these Earthlings. Did you just say billion, with a B? Yes. Are you sure a hearing test is not needed? Arcee, see what you can do about avoiding as many Earthlings as you can. Entering Earth's outer atmosphere. Brace for impact! This is it. They're here. Whoa. Come here. Just a little closer. Come to Papa. Gotcha! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, hey, are, are you okay? I'm fine. Marvin? Marvin Skerety? Hey, it's me, John, John Griffin. Yes, yes, hello, John. Nice to see you. Here, here, let me help you up. Nope, no, no. I'm, I'm, I'm fine, I'm fine. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Well, at least let me grab your, your... No, no, no. I, I can get it myself. Actually, I, I do think I need some help up. Yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Thank you, thank you. So, how are you? Fine, fine. When did, when did you get back in town? Last night. We're here for the summer. Avery, you remember my wife Avery? She's here doing some of her star map documentation. Obviously, as you know, the skies here are perfect for that. Yes. Yes, yes. Well, well, welcome back, John. I must, I must be going. I see you're still doing your, your alien thing. It's called ufology, okay? And it's a real thing. Yeah, of course, of course. I'm, I'm happy for you. I, it was great to see you. We should, we should get together sometime. Not sure I can. I'm very busy. I got a big lead. Very, very, very top, top secret. Oh. Tell Avery I said hello. Yeah, will do. Take care, Marvin. Good old Marvin the Martian. Emergency power initiated. Are we dead? It doesn't look like it. You have successfully landed on Earth. Your definition of successful is very different than mine, Computer. Damage report. Significant damages detected. Hex, what can you make of it? Well, we aren't getting home like this. But you can fix it, right? Of course. Great. After we collect all the parts that fell off during entry. Uh, what parts? These parts. And thankfully, they aren't too far away from this area. Well, let's go get 'em. Aye, aye, Captain. Um, Hex, you probably shouldn't go out there looking like you do. And why not? We don't know if this planet is friendly. She's right. This planet isn't a part of the explored areas of the Alliance. Computer, what do Earthlings think of aliens? Searching. Running research now. We're gonna end up someone's science experiment! Okay, calm down. We can figure this out. How? This planet doesn't exactly welcome aliens. What if we weren't aliens? Say what now? Computer, is the morphing tube operational? Affirmative. We're gonna blend in as something else. Ace, you're a genius! That's Captain Genius. We're too small to pass as Earthlings. Computer, run a search on the creatures in this sector, please. Wow, there's so many. What about those? Naked mole rats. Oh, they are so cute. Uh, no. Computer, what is this region's most popular creature? Something cute and adorable. This region's most popular creature is known as a dog or canine. Also known as man's best friend. Man's best friend? They're perfect. We'll change into them. Kids, breakfast! You guys are going to love this food. Sandy's is the best. This is good. Don't talk with your mouth full. Yeah, don't talk with your mouth full. Don't encourage him. Fine. Oh, I have missed Sandy's so much. Mom! Don't talk with your mouth full. Sorry. What do you guys got going on today? Nothing. My phone is dead. Good, you can take me exploring. Where? In the woods. That sounds fun. It does? Here, give this a shot. What's this? A solar powered charger? Yeah, well, with the power out, figured this would help charge your stuff. Cool. - Thanks, Dad. - Yeah. Wait for me! Is that really helpful? Baby steps. Plus, have you ever seen him that excited to go outside? No. Oh, you know who I saw today? Who? Marvin. Yeah. Remember, the kids used to call him Marvin the Martian? You used to call him that too. All right, maybe I did. Yeah. How's he doing? He's fine. He's still doing the alien thing. Anyway, he said to say hi. Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, this is so good. Come on, Sam. Hang on, I'm trying to get some sun to charge my stuff. But we have to go this way. What's that way? You'll see. Initiating. How do I look? Amazing. How do you feel? Furry, smaller, and a little itchy. Your turn, Arcee. How's everything feel? Everything good? A little strange, but yeah. Whoa. Look at this tail! Ah, I can't stop wagging it. Cute. It's gotta be around here somewhere. Yes. How about you keep looking around? I'm gonna stay here for a few minutes, charge my phone. Fine, but you're gonna miss it. Don't go too far. Where are you? There you are. Are you sure you don't need me to go too? I already have my dog form picked out. I think it's better that you stay here and continue to repair the ship. No one does it better than you. You got it. Good luck, Hex. You too. All right, team, listen up. The quicker we can collect the pieces we need, the quicker we can get home. All right, let's go. Watch out for Earthlings! Cassie! Earthling! Ow! Cassie? I have to say, I'm really enjoying this dog form. Oh, watch this. - Woo! - Hey. Sorry. Huh, that was interesting. Let me try. Wow! Woo-hoo! Great job. Hide. I found this over there. It's an Earthling child. What do we do? I don't know. Stay put. Maybe she can't see us. I can see your tails. Quick, what do dogs sound like? I don't remember. Wait, I think I got it. Meow? Meow, meow, meow, meow. Um, dogs don't meow. Oh. Moo. That's a cow. Ribbit? Frogs. Oh. You're an alien, aren't you? No. We are just highly trained dogs. I don't think so. Pretty sure she's on to us, Ace. Maybe not. I saw your ship land last night, but don't worry, your secret's safe with me. I'm Cassie. I'm Renkanavi Cion. But you can call me Arcee. Well, I guess there's no use in the charade any longer, huh? Captain Ace Beadlock of the Briox Alliance. Nice to meet you. Just so you know, dogs don't talk. They bark. Oh, that's right. Bark? I think this is yours. The flex ionizer? You found it? Whoa! Thank you. Well, at least we recovered one of the pieces. Do you need help finding more? Yes. We lost several pieces of our ship when we entered your planet's atmosphere. We need to recover them so we can return home. My brother and I would love to help you. Your brother? Sibling unit, sir. Cassie? Yes, perhaps we could keep our presence a secret from your brother. The less your kind knows about us, the better. Okay, I won't tell him. Cassie, Cassie. Sam? Cassie, we are in danger. Why? Where did these dogs come from? I found them in the forest. They're my new friends. Captain, Captain! An Earthling saw me! Hex? I mean, bark. Uh, oops. Is he dead? No. Well, what happened to him? I think he fainted. Fascinating. Do all Earthlings just fall down like that? Sam? Sam, are you okay? What happened? You fainted. It was amazing. Oh, oh, is he gonna do it again? Hex. What? Aliens! Looks like the cat's outta the bag. I thought we were dogs. I'm calling Mom and Dad. You can't. Why not? Because they're our friends, Sam! How do you know that? It's true, Sam. We are friends. I'm Arcee and this is Ace. Captain Ace. I'm Hex. We met back at the ship. That was you? You look different. Yeah, that was my true form. We became dogs to try to blend in. It's not working very well. They need our help. Help with what? To take over the world? No, no, nothing like that. Actually, a bunch of pieces fell off our ship and we have to find them. Do you know where they are? Yes. Our collars are locked onto their last known trajectories. Do you know these locations? No, we just moved here. But hang on. Maybe if I... Yeah, there we go! It seems like a lot of your pieces are close by. Two of them are right by our house. Your house? As in your dwelling? Yeah. Yeah, do you wanna see it? Yeah, I would love to. We should probably keep them outta sight of Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad? Parental units. No problem. I was the top of my class in stealth abilities. I will be as quiet as a vop. It sounds like vops aren't very quiet. That was my stomach. We haven't eaten for several cycles. Oh. Sorry. That one was me. Mom can make us lunch. Let's go. Yeah, hello? Yes. Power's out. Oh, is that the power company? Yeah, I'm on hold. I've got lunch. Nice. Okay. It looks like Mom has some food. Great, I'm starving. You three stay here in the garage. The garage? Yes, just try not to touch anything. We'll bring you back some food when we can. Sorry. We will anxiously await your return. What do you think all this stuff is for? I believe they are the Earthlings' version of tools. How do they fix anything with these? Look! It's the missing rotator coupling. Oh, I'm still on hold. Come on, is lunch ready yet? It is actually. I got us barbecue. Yum. Guys, save some of that for us. Oh, watch out, that's spicy. Hey, we're gonna go eat outside. Bye! Outside? Country's great. Love you, Mom, bye. Would you look at that? What, you don't think that's weird? I think it's two kids enjoying the great outdoors. Mm-hmm. I think they're up to something. Oh, they're 100% up to something, but at least they're doing it outside. Whew! That's spicy. I told you. Yep. I'm still here. I think I got it. Wait! Hex, are you okay? Mission accomplished. Kids? Dad's coming, hide! Kids? Oh. Yeah, sorry, I thought I heard a noise in my garage. Yeah, yeah. The box is over here. Yep, I see the switch. It's in the off position. Uh oh. Uh oh? What do you mean, uh oh? Oh no, the food's too spicy. Something is wrong with my mouth. You're gonna give away our position. Turning it on now. Hot, hot. Hot, hot, hot, hot! Yes, I'm fine. The power is on. Thank you. Somebody there? Hey, honey? In here! The power's back on. I know. I fixed it. Fire! My mouth is on fire! Here, drink this. Better? Yes. Excellent. Shall we eat? Yes. And do you have any more of that spicy sauce? Is there something I can help you with, fella? Hello. Hello, sir, sorry to bother you. Marvin Skerety. I'm with the AIA and I have a few readings here that suggest you may have some extraterrestrials. Extra what? Terrestrials. No, sir. I don't know what that fancy piece of equipment is telling you, but I can assure you we don't have any terrestrials, let alone extras. I've got a couple chickens. You know, I've got a cat. No, no, no, I think you're confused, sir. The AIA is the Alien Intelligence Agency. You know, the little green men. Little green men? Don't you think there could be little green women too? What? You never thought about that? I, I don't, I... Sorry, sorry. Look, can we rewind? I believe something alien may have landed on your property last night and I'm trying to recover it. Oh. Follow me. When I woke up this morning, there was a hole in my roof and this thing was laying in the dirt. I didn't touch it or nothing because I'm afraid of radiation or something. Oh, it is definitely alien. Hmm. Well, Mr. Anderson, thank you for your time. As a member of the AIA, it is my duty to take this off of your hands. Whoa. You like the FBI? Sort of. We just aren't a bunch of hacks held back by a bunch of red tape and bureaucratic nonsense. They wouldn't hire you, right? No. But they will, once I prove that aliens exist. Good luck with that. You have done a great deal for your planet, sir. Unfortunately, you are going to forget that I was ever here. What was that light supposed to do? It was supposed to make you forget. Did it work? No, sir. Darn it. The internet these days. What about 40 bucks? Would that make you forget? Forget what? It is only a matter of time before your owner comes looking for you. I can't say I've ever eaten anything quite like... What do you call that again? Barbecue. Barbecue, yes. It was rather delicious. The item should be right around here, Captain. Is that it? Yeah, good eye. I'll get it. He must do that a lot. I've never seen him climb a tree before in my life. You're doing great, Sam! Thanks. Whoa. Whose idea was this? You're almost there. Be careful! Yeah, I know. Got it. What just happened? We caught you with our collars. They manipulate electromagnetic waves. Oh, cool, cool. Yeah, cool. Oh, he did it again! Sam. Sam, are you all right? Come on. What happened? You fainted again. Oh, I thought I was done for. Wait, couldn't you just have grabbed this thing using your collars? Yes, but you climbed the tree before we could use them. You seemed happy to do it too. I thought it was fun to watch. Yeah, next time when you have some amazing powers that can avoid my impending doom, please feel free to stop me. This request has been received. Perhaps we should begin the repairs with the parts we have. A fine idea. Would you like to see our ship? Yeah. Here we are. I don't see anything. Computer, deactivate cloaking device. Whoa. Welcome to the X76. This is crazy. Would you like to come inside? Yes. Sure. Wow. Wow. Hello, Computer. Welcome back, Captain. I see you've brought guests. Yes, and some parts. I'm gonna start working on some repairs. These are our new Earth friends, Sam and Cassie. Greetings, Sam and Cassie. Hello. Hi. This is the bridge. That's where Arcee pilots the ship. And this is where I sit to command the ship. Awesome. Well, is there anything we can do to help? Yeah. Let me show you. All right, baby. Come to Papa. Is everything ready, Hex? Yes, Captain. We have installed all the parts that have been found. Okay, what's next? Commencing hover test now. Hover test? Initiating hover mode. It's so quiet. That's because it's riding electromagnetic waves. Well, thanks to you, our hover systems are back online. So you can go home now? No. It's enough for us to move the ship, but not enough to leave the planet's atmosphere. But it's a start. It's Mom and Dad. We have to go. - Bye, Computer. - Bye, Computer. Nice meeting you, Sam and Cassie. We really appreciate your help today. If you want, we could take you guys to town and find the rest of your parts. If it isn't any trouble. No, we wanna help you. Perfect. Let's make it so. Warning, unidentified human approaching. Initiating security protocol. Oh, hello there. I thought I heard voices. Walking your dogs? Oh, yeah. Sorry to bother you, but you haven't by chance seen any strange things out here, have you? Strange man with a strange device? What? Oh, no, no, no, I'm cool with that. I'm just looking for some unusual metal pieces. Have you seen any? Nope. Nope, just some garbage here and there. Hmm, anything like this? You mean like alien pieces? Cassie. What, what makes you think this is alien? It's glowing, just like- Cassie. Just like what? Just like his video games. Yep, yeah, just like my alien video games. Looks like I... Looks like I have something. What? What was that? Did you feel that? Yeah, crazy wind, right? What, what in the world? Well, we better get going. Good luck with your alien stuff. Hey! Just curious, I thought I heard some other voices out here. Excuse me? You know, like adult voices? Oh. Uh... My brother was on the phone with our parents. They want us to go home, so we better listen. Yeah. Yeah, don't wanna get in any trouble. Bye. Hey, if you happen to find any, you know, alien pieces, give me a call. I'll even pay you. Yeah. Sounds good. Thank you. Come on, dogs. Sam, slow down! We can't! He might be following us. Did you see that, Captain? He had our gyroscope stabilizer. Indeed. But we have to get them back to their ship. Captain, I don't know who that guy is, but I think you should spend the night with us. I agree with this plan. But what about Mommy and Daddy? Yes, but what about Mommy and Daddy? You let me worry about them. Whoa. We're staying in an Earthling house tonight? Yes, so you'd better behave yourself. Hey, I always behave myself. What about that time on Meko 50? That wasn't my fault. And the time with those throttle trops? They started it. Two words, urchin arena. Oh yeah. That was totally my fault. Sam, Cassie, is that you? Yeah, Mom! Perfect timing. Come eat dinner. Mm, dinner. Hex, shh. What? You three just wait here for a bit. I'll bring you dinner later. Approximately how long is later? I don't know, whenever we finish dinner? Kids, you heard your mom. Come on. Oh, there you kids are. Come on. Mm, looks really good. A lot easier now that the power's back on. Where were you two today? Just out. We met some new friends. New friends? That's great. How old are they? Um, we don't know, but they're really funny and nice. Aha. Hex, what are you doing? I am making us dinner. Sam told us to wait. He doesn't need to know. Hex, I order you to stop. Okay. But try this first. Oh. Hex, I order you to keep cooking. Captain! I can't help it, it's delicious. What was that? Just the wind? Mice? I'll go check it out. Me too. Now I really know they're up to something. Definitely. What are you doing? What is going on in here? Let me guess. Your new friends? Yeah. Oh, the father figure looks pretty upset. What's he saying? Hang on, hang on. I'm an expert at reading mouths. I really like dancing around the lake with noodles on my head. That's not what he's saying. Yes, it is. Step aside, okay? Your mouth reading skills are not as in tune as mine. Tomorrow, I want you to go to Casablanca where you will find the odors of the dudes. No way. Mine made more sense. Really? Dancing around the lake with noodles on my head? That made more sense? Yeah, maybe that's his thing. I don't judge. Um, pardon me, Captain. But the biological makeup of this dog form has very acute hearing, so I've been using it to listen in. Mr. Griffin is very upset that the children tried to hide us from them. But good news is he said that we can stay here for the evening. Oh, well, that's great. And tomorrow, Sam and Cassie have to go into town to find our owners. Wait, they're coming. All right, everybody in. All right, you three. We've decided that you can stay, but no more craziness like we just saw in the kitchen, okay? Pretty smart dog. You two make sure you find their owner tomorrow, okay? - Okay, Mom. - Okay, Mom. All right, go ahead, head up to bed. Good night. Come on, pups. Is that us? Yes, you. Come on. I made a nice little place for you to sleep. Thank you, Cassie. Ooh, it's so soft. So tomorrow, Mom and Dad are going to take us to town to find your owners. But this is perfect 'cause it gives us time to find the rest of your ship pieces. Excellent. I like this plan. Shh, they're coming. All ready for bed? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. John, don't you think maybe you should take the dogs out for a little walk before we go to bed? Yeah, okay. Pups, come on. Mush, mush, this... Come on, this way. Let's go. Goodnight, kids. All right, dogs. Do your business. Come on. It's getting, getting late. Do your thing. Come on. Go ahead. Come on, let's go. You better do this now. I'm not gonna get up in the middle of the night to take you out again. I give up. You were gone for like 30 minutes. They did not go to the bathroom. They just stared at me. Maybe they didn't have to go to the bathroom. It was the weirdest thing. It was like they didn't know what to do. He wanted us to what? Go to the bathroom. Outside? Is that how humans do it? Ew. I'm gonna have to watch where I step. No, we do it inside in the toilets. But dogs do it outside. If you don't mind, I will not be going outside. Me neither. Uh-uh, nope. Hey, you guys need to keep it down in here. I can hear you through the walls. Sorry. We have a big day tomorrow. Get some rest. Sam's right. Everyone, let's get some sleep. Good night. - Good night. - Night. Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. No more snacking before bed. Okay, you put up flyers so that Mom and Dad think we're looking for the owners of the dogs. It looks like there are a couple of ship pieces nearby, so let's go. What? The aldidinator should have been right here. Maybe someone took it? Yeah, maybe that weird guy from yesterday. We gotta find the other parts fast. It looks like it's over there? Perfect. Should be around here somewhere. I don't see it. I think it's up on the roof. I see it. I got it. Wow, it's really stuck. Here, let me help. Help. What's happening? Let me down, please. Let me down. Put him down! What's, what's happening? Okay. He dropped it. How did you do that? How did... Hey, hey, kids. Hey, where, where are you going? Kids, wait, wait. Hey, kids, come back! Hey, kids, kids. Come back here. Kids, where you going? Come back. In here. I just wanna talk to you! What is this magical place? It's an ice cream shop. Do you wanna try some? Does a mildridop have eight arms? Uh, yes? That was the most pleasant experience of my life. Agreed. What was your favorite flavor? Oh, the one at the bottom. You mean the cone? Yes, the cone was delightful. Wait, wait, where you going? Kids, wait, wait. Hey, kids, come back! He's chasing us! Marvin. Was that Marvin? Yeah, it was. You know that guy? Yeah, we went to high school with him. Do you know him? - No. - No. He had a huge crush on your mom. No, he did not. Yes, he did. Why do you think you guys were in all the same classes together? Because we both loved space. Mom, can we take the dogs out for a walk? Sure. Be back before dark. Come on, doggies. Good luck with that. We're not gonna see them for a while. Those dogs don't go to the bathroom outside. They're trained to use the toilet. You are talking nonsense. I saw it with my own eyes. Like that? That ought to do it. Okay, Arcee, try it now. Computer, initiate flight systems. Initiating flight systems. Systems initiation failure. It's no use. Without the pieces Marvin has, we aren't gonna be able to make it home. Too bad we can't distract him for a few hours. Wait, I got it. All we have to do is convince Mom and Dad to invite Marvin over for dinner. While he's over at our house, you'll go to his house and collect all of your spaceship pieces. Isn't that stealing, Sam? Not when he took something that was already yours. I like this plan. So I downloaded the blueprints from Marvin's lab. It seems that this is the best way going in through the air duct here. So Arcee, if you could go here and just go through here and get about here, you could use your collars to float down and get all your pieces. That doesn't sound too bad. It shouldn't be. We'll stall as much as we can, but don't spend too much time looking around. Get in and get out. Got it? Got it. Now all we have to do is convince Mom and Dad to invite Marvin over for dinner. Okay, here's the plan. I will go search up some alien websites on Dad's computer to get Marvin's AIA ads popping up. Cassie, you will go ask Mom about her space classes in high school with Marvin. Marvin, Marvin, Marvin. And Hex, you will drop Marvin's business card where Dad can find it. Everybody good? Good. Hey guys, hope you don't mind, but your mom and I invited our friend Marvin over for dinner tonight. Oh, you did? Yeah. So we're gonna need you guys to be on your best behavior, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Oh, and maybe leave the dogs in the garage? Thanks. So do I still need to bring the card in? Marvin, so good to see you. - Oh yeah. - Come on in. Absolutely. Yeah. All right, Marvin's here. Go, go, go. Come on. John. Marvin, how are you? - Good, good. - Good to see you. Kids! Our guest is... We're right here, Mom. You snuck up on me. Marvin, these are our children, Sam and Cassie. Hello. Nice to... Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Shall we eat? Yes. Whoa. Somebody lives in this place? Captain, do we have to go in there? Yes, we have to go in there. Come on, guys, we can do this. All right. Gotta fit. Oh, excuse me. That's my home alarm. Oh. Everything okay? Yes. Yes, it looks like a few raccoons are trying to get into my trash, yes. Thankfully, I have a few traps set up for situations like this. Look, there's the opening up there. I'm on it. Okay, Hex, keep watch. Once we're in, we'll open the door for you. You got it, Captain. Which way was it? Two lefts, then a right. That's right. Everything's going as planned. Hey, looks like you left the door open. How about that? Are you sure everything's okay? Hmm? Yep, yep, everything's going according to plan. So Marvin, where are you living now? Oh. Do you remember the old science facility? Oh, those dome buildings? Yes, yes. I live out there. Wow, I loved those buildings. Yeah, you know, after it closed down, I got it really cheap. You know, it's really secluded. Lots of space. That's so you. I'm gonna get the dessert. - Let me help. - Okay. Hey, kids. Wanna see what I'm watching? Let's see here. Oh, there's our parts. Hey, Arcee! Hey, Captain! Hex, how'd you get in here? The door was open. And look, it's all of our stuff. No, Hex, wait! Uh oh. Yes. All that work for nothing, huh? Oh, yeah? Uh oh. What's that? Got it. Whoa! Oh no, Arcee! I, I can't hold on! Hold on, Arcee, maybe I can push you up. I got her. Oh no, my collar isn't working. What happened? I figured out your friends were manipulating electromagnetic waves. My buildings were made to block EMPs, so now they're pretty much helpless. They're going to get hurt! Maybe. But you all chose to break into my house instead of just asking me for the metal pieces back. Why are you doing this? Because all my life people have laughed at me, saying that aliens don't exist. Well, I'm going to prove them all wrong. And soon people will finally believe me when I tell them that there are aliens out there. What makes you think they'll believe you this time? Because this time I'm calling my contact from the FBI. Oh, it's breaking. Arcee, hold on! No! No! What? I didn't mean for that to happen. Who wants dessert? Cassie, wait! Actually I'm... I'm pretty, pretty stuffed. I better get going and take care of those intruders. Thanks for dinner. Sure. Dessert doesn't look that bad, does it? Well... Skerety. Didn't I tell you if you ever call my phone again, I'd have you arrested? Yes, yes. You did, Agent Bridger. So I must have a good reason to be calling you. You always claim to have a good reason. Ah, but this time is a really good reason. I am sending you videos right now. Lemme guess, more alien conspiracy videos. Oh, I knew you still watched my videos. What can I say, Skerety? My kids think you're hilarious. This isn't a joke! I just apprehended three ETs disguised as dogs and they have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves. There are aliens among us, Agent Bridger. These videos are proof. So you either do something or I call the CIA. All right, now calm down, Skerety. I'll have my crew take a look at it. We'll be in touch. Yes sir. Yes, yes! Oh, my time is finally here. FBI, here I come. Agent Dawes. Yes sir. Get ready to move out. Everything good, sir? Yeah, everything's fine. Looks like Skerety finally paid off. Marvin the Martian, huh? Who knew? Oh, and Dawes. Have a dissection crew on hand too. It looks like he has some live specimens for us. Roger that. Let's move out! Cassie, you all right? No, we have to do something. I know. But what? We could tell Mommy and Daddy. Tell 'em what? That our dogs were secretly aliens and their weird friend kidnapped them, so now we have to go to his house to save them? Yeah. You know what? I guess it doesn't sound that weird when you say it out loud. All right, let's go. Arcee, Captain? Arcee! Hex! Where's Ace? Did anyone get the name of the ship that hit us? Ace, you're okay! So are you. Oh, wow. How are you, Hex? I'm fine, but I'm pretty sure Marvin will be back soon, so you two better get out of here. No, Hex, we aren't leaving without you. It's okay, Captain. Please, you take the pieces, get to the ship. I'll be fine. Go! Don't worry about me. We'll be back. I know you will. Hi there. And how is our little guest? Yes, very cute, but the jig is up. I already know your little secret and soon the whole world will know it too. So there's no use in continuing with the charade. Uh, what's a charade? I knew it, I knew you could talk! I knew it. You got me. But what's a charade? It means pretending to be something you're not, like an alien pretending to be a dog. Oh, you mean charade. Oh, I understand. I don't need English lessons from you. Actually, I think it's French. Okay, enough of that. Let's check in on your friends, shall we? Where are your friends? I dunno. It's fine, it's fine, I only need you. And that, that fancy collar of yours. That's what lets you manipulate electromagnetic waves, right? Maybe. Let's document this, shall we? All right, world, the moment you've all been waiting for, proof that I am not a quack! No. Should I have told you that was gonna happen? Sorry, not sorry. So let me get this straight. The three dogs that you brought into our home are really aliens from another planet? - Yes! - Yes! And now we have to go to Marvin's science complex to save them. - Yes! - Yes! Even if this story is true, you came up with a plan to break into another person's house. Do you have any idea how bad that is? It's really bad. Really, really bad. I know. And it's my fault, not Cassie's, but we need to go. You two aren't going anywhere. I'll go over to Marvin's house and ask if he has my kids'... Alien dogs? Hey, look, he fainted. Like father, like son. You're okay! Yes, we're fine. But Marvin still has Hex. We need to get him. I'm pretty sure Marvin already called the FBI. The FBI? The FBI hurts aliens. We better hurry. Shall we, Mrs. Griffin? Uh, sure? Okay, let's go. Come on, honey. What's going on? We're helping alien dogs. - We are? - Uh huh. Yes, and we really appreciate this. Captain Ace, at your service. Arcee. Nice to officially meet you. Nice to meet you. Is this a dream? Uh, not unless we're having the same dream. No more letting the kids play outside. Wanna try for three? Ow. What the... Where are the ship pieces? Did your, did your friends take them? We're not finished here, mister. Agent Bridger, hello. My crew's validated your intel and we are headed to your location. Really? I mean, perfect, perfect, I'll see you there. I mean, here. And Skerety, don't mess this up. No, sir. No, sir, absolutely not. I've got it all... Hello? He hung up. Okay, Arcee, Sam, and Mrs. Griffin, you head to the ship and finish with the repairs. Mr. Griffin, Cassie, and I will go to Marvin's complex to save Hex. Got it? Got it. Whoa, isn't this a bit much? John, it's gonna be fine. You save their friend, I'll meet you back here later. Are you sure? I have been staring at the stars my whole life, waiting for a moment like this. It's gonna be fine. All right, good enough for me. Let's go. All right, time for us to go. Oh. You mean I don't get to stay here in these fancy accommodations? No, I have something even fancier. And before you get any ideas, I've added a few upgrades to this here carrier so you can't use your little superpower. So don't even think about it. Come on, little doggy. How you doing with that stabilizer, Sam? Almost got it. Oh, is there anything I can do to help? You're doing great, Mrs. Griffin. Got it. Hello, Computer. Hello. Hey, Computer. Welcome back, Sam. This is Mrs. Griffin. Greetings, Mrs. Griffin. Hi. You can call me Avery. Greetings, Avery. I am Computer. This is amazing. It is not too far from what I always imagined. Computer, status report. Systems check. Stabilizers are online. Ship is ready for operation. Ha! We did it. Although. What do you mean, although? A short has caused some loss to the star charts, and we still don't have full access to the power core, making it impossible to leave this planet's gravitational pull. Oh no. We're gonna need Hex for the power core, and I don't know what we're gonna do about these star charts. Star charts? I am the queen of star charts. Computer, what are you missing? Calculating. They're beautiful. As you can see, I am missing several sections of this galaxy's charts. That's all? This is what I do. Sam, my boy, watch your mama work. Yeah, way to go, Mom. Any moment now, my life is going to change. Yep. And mine is too. I sure hope it was worth it. You know how many doctors my parents brought me to because they didn't believe I saw aliens? I don't know, two? A lot. It was a lot. But I thought none of this matters because the aliens promised they'd come back and when they did, it would make it all better. But they didn't. They didn't come back. So... So, I'm sorry you have to be the one to make it all worth it. But that's just the way it has to be. You know, there's a lot of us out there. Some aren't as advanced as others and space travel takes a long time. It's possible they just haven't made it back here yet. Or maybe they just got lost. The universe is a big place. Yeah, well, it's too late now. All right. Let's go save your friend. Roger that. Hey, Marvin. What, what are you doing here? Relax. We're just here to talk. Don't come any closer! Do you think we're just gonna let you give Hex to the FBI? Who's going to stop me? I am. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Oh yeah? Why? You didn't think I planned ahead? One push and your friend gets zapped. Don't hurt him! Then tell your little alien friend to put me down. Put him down, Captain. Now, everybody, everybody back up, please. Yeah, that's right, that's more like it. Get outta here, there's nothing to see! Leave, go home. Yeah, I'll give you 10 seconds or I'll push the button. Get out. Mr. Martin? I'm really sorry we broke into your home. And you were right, we should have just asked for your help. Please don't be mad at our alien friends? They just wanna go home. It's okay. Let's go, come on. Cassie, I'm sorry. She gave you Rumpelstiltskin. That's so nice. And that button you were going to push. Wasn't that just your car remote? Quiet, you. There he is. Showtime. Well. Nice to see you, Skerety. You too. You have what we came for? Yes sir. Go for dissection team. What? You, you brought a dissection team? Just a precautionary measure. See what you have. What is this, Skerety? What? What happened? It must have transformed into a stuffed animal. What is this, some kind of joke? Sir, we have a vehicle leaving the perimeter. That's them! Hold on to your cowboy hats. Yeehaw. I'm not wearing a cowboy hat! Move out! Cancel dissection team. You're done, Skerety. Oh, I was hoping that wouldn't be your response, but I understand. All right, Sam, do you see some tubes? Yes, tubes, got it. Connect those into the goo. How far? Until it lights up. Got it. Okay, now what? Now do that five more times. Come on. What you get on those plates? I found an address, but it's in New York City. All right, see what else you can find. Come on, can't you go any faster? Yes sir. But is the point to catch them or follow them to the destination? Odds are they're headed to the alien ship. Well, if you catch them, I can force 'em to tell me where their ship is. Yes sir. Oh, they're gaining on us. Captain, I've got an idea. Would you mind if I tried something? Go for it. Whoa. Okay, everyone, hold on. Agent Bridger, I found a local address for those plates. Let me hear it. That was awesome. Those guys gonna be okay? Oh yeah. It's only temporary. They'll grow back in a few minutes. Good, because I can't have the FBI after me. Hurry, to the ship. To the ship. Okay, last one. Okay, it worked. Sam, you did it! Main power core activated. Thank you for fixing the maps, Mrs. Griffin. Glad to help. Yeah. Computer, set a course home. Setting course. Course complete. Captain Ace approaching. They're back. Oh, honey. Hey, guys. Hex! All right, we better make this fast. Is everything good to go? Yes, Captain. Thank you all so much for your help. Yes, thank you. We really couldn't have done any of this without all of you. Sam. Captain. You're quite the leader. Your plan saved the day several times. Who knows, maybe one day you'll become a captain yourself. Are you hearing this? Hear this? I saw it. Thank you, Captain Ace. I learned a lot from you. Bye, Arcee. Bye, Cassie. Oh, I'm gonna miss you. Bye, Sam. Oh, I'm sure gonna miss all that food. Bye, buddy. Take care, everyone. Bye, Cassie. Be good. I will. Bye, Mrs. Griffin. Bye, Sam. Hex, I'm gonna miss you so much. Wait! Marvin? Is it okay if I say goodbye too? Of course. I'm sorry I was going to turn you in. I... I know you are. And I knew you weren't gonna go through with it. You did? Yep. So, this is your ship? Yep. Was it here the whole time? Uh, yep. I knew I wasn't crazy. And you never were. Always remember that. I will. Is now a good time to remind everybody that the feds are gonna be here any minute? Ah, yeah, that's more like it. Bye! Bye. Thank you! Bye! Bye. Stop them, stop them! I'm not sure how, sir! You all are in so much trouble. Oh, no, we aren't. What are you gonna do with that? My alien friends left me this shrinking technology. So if you mess with me or this family again, I will shrink you. This time, permanently. You wouldn't. Try me. You haven't seen the last of me, Skerety. Let's go. I look forward to our next encounter, Agent Bridger. Marvin, you really came through for us today. Yes, you did. Thank you. It's nice to have people believe in you. And kids, my wish came true. What's that? My wish on the shooting star. Yeah? I wished that you guys would have a good summer. I think that came true. - We did. - Mm-hmm. Ah, quite an adventure. Yes, it was. Do you think we'll ever see them again? You never know. I hope so. Me too, Arcee, me too. Computer, take us home. Affirmative, Captain. Little Marvin, is that you? You came back, after all these years. You finally came back.
