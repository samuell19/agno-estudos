That awful, fidgety man. He's muttered the words all through the play. My dear, don't you know who he is? Frederick T.H. Skeates, the critic on the Daily Post. Good evening, Mr Skeates, sir. Lovely evening, isn't it, sir. Is it? Good evening, Mr Skeates. I can give you 65 lines. Will that do? Good evening, Mr Skeates. - Take this down, Ann. Opening night, Othello. Tragedy by William Shakespeare. Evening, Mr Skeates. I don't want to say good evening. Why aren't you taking this down? Opening night, Othello. What a day! We're coming out with 32 pages tomorrow. Sensational news. A resolution passed at the plenary session of the League Of Nations today. For a new plenary session of the League in which .. The League Of Nations would be laid down for next year. Ann, don't tell me news. Take this down. I thought you'd be interested. You never read papers. Ann, will you write .. Well then: Opening night. Othello. And so on and so on. Musical sequences by Samuel Coleridge Taylor. Once more, after a long interval. The London stage presents us with this, the most .. Tragic .. of all Shakespeare's plays. Othello. Where the human soul gropes .. yes, gropes. And is lost in the pitch-black caverns of .. When the London theatre takes it upon itself .. To let this play of Shakespeare's stand forth .. In a new light .. it must at least provide itself with actors .. Who possess the soul .. In which to bring the poet's characters to life. But! I only want to know if you really need 65 lines for your review tonight. I don't know. Why are you butting in like this? The whole sheet is crammed full but for 65 lines reserved for you. I need 20 for my obituary. A member of parliament slipped roller-skating this morning. A dead cert he'll pass away in the night. Why should he? A man can slip up roller skating without fatal results. Mr Skeates, the man is 93 years old. The nurse promises to ring up when the sad event takes place. Take your 20 lines, only get out, Out! - Yes, sir. Oh Ann, saw a lovely girl today. I'd marry her like a shot. Like to see her picture? Isn't she sweet? Fool! Oh run along, Tom. - Thank you, Mr Skeates. The man is a perfect pest. Never in his own office. Where on earth does he do his work? Go on, Ann. Go on. Take this down. Tommy's as mad as a hatter. But he has something, Mr Skeates. Really he has. You ought to read his articles. I don't even read my own articles. Let alone Mr Stapleton's. I think you're absolutely right not to read newspapers, Mr Skeates. It only puts one in a bad temper. - Oh. Keep the 20 lines, Mr Skeates. The 93-year MP has picked up a lot. He's toying with the idea of marrying his nurse. Oh Stapleton .. please go! Apropos, nurse. When do we get married, Ann? Oh get out, Tommy. Please go! - Yes, sir. Please take this down. Now where were we .. oh yes. The .. title role of Othello was taken by an actor .. Entirely new to the London stage. Mr Edmond Davey. We are accustomed to actors who .. Bravely make the most of a small part. Mr Edmond .. Davey .. puzzles us by making the least of a big one. Modesty is one of the Moor's virtues. But diffidence is no .. Virtue in the actor who plays the Moor. Certainly, Mr Davey was very nicely blacked. He will forgive me. Or perhaps he will not. If I mention. That for an actor to imagine. That Othello's passion is only skin deep .. Is as though Cyrano de Bergerac couldn't see further than the end of his nose. Mr Edmond Davey's Othello was, apart from his black make-up. Wan and colourless. His love .. was without passion. His jealousy .. without rage. In the great murder scene in the .. Last act. Mr Davey was so phlegmatic .. That one did not for one moment .. Fear for Desdemona's life. What's that? This is Mr Skeates' office. Who is it, please? There's a lady on the phone for you. She won't give her name. I never converse with nameless ladies. I'm very sorry. Mr Skeates can't speak to you just now. The part of Desdemona was taken by an actress likewise .. New to the West End stage. Miss Barbara Halford. An artist with great depths of soul. Deserving of a better partner. [ Telephone ] What is it now? This is Mr Skeates' office. Who is ..? It's the same lady who called before. She says it's very important. It is very important? It is very important to establish here and now. That the performance of tonight .. Does not signify a gain .. For the English theatre. Mr Edmond Davey. Is by no means .. The ideal Shakespearean hero for whom we have been waiting so long. Support parts were played by actors long known to the public and valued by them. Write that out, take it down to the composing room and .. goodnight. Good evening, Mr Skeates, sir. A lovely evening, isn't it. - Couldn't be better. Mr Skeates, please. - I'm sorry, Madam. Mr Skeates .. Don't say I can't see him. I've got to. Where is he? I'm sorry Madam, but Mr Skeates is no longer on the premises. It isn't possible. He can't have gone out yet. He must be in the building. I am sure he is writing his review. I telephoned only a few minutes ago. So it was you on the telephone? I ought to be very grateful to you. You saved my pompom twice. That is Mr Skeates' secretary. Wait a minute, Katharine. - Very well, Madam. Listen, you've got to help me. Is that the notice of tonight's opening of Othello? Yes. I'm just sending it to the Comp' room. Will you please tell me, is it good or bad? You'll be able to read it yourself tomorrow. At 7am the newspapers will be on sale at all street corners in London. Goodnight. I can't wait until tomorrow. I've got to know before that notice goes into print whether it's good or bad. But you must realize, I can't tell you that. I'm Barbara Halford. I played Desdemona tonight. Now perhaps you'll tell me what the notice says. Barbara Halford? - Yes. Well, since you rescued my pompom I'll tell you. Mr Skeates wrote very well about you. It is not me I'm interested in. I've come about Edmond Davey, the man who played Othello. What does Mr Skeates say about him? If he's the way Mr Skeates described him he'd better look round for another job. I'm afraid I feel a little faint. Could you get me a glass of water? - Why, of course. Listen to me. As it stands at present, Mr Skeates' notice will not be printed. Are you mad? Open that door at once. No, I'm not mad and I'll not open that door until that notice has been altered. A bad notice from Skeates is death to an actor. It means the ruin of his career. Edmond Davey's career is not going to be ruined. He was bad tonight, I know he was. He was hopeless. But it was only tonight. He was nervous, unsure of himself. He'd never played in a London theatre before. But he'll be better tomorrow. A thousand times better. He is definitely a very great actor and that notice has got to be altered. Well, this is amazing. Never before in the history of theatre have I heard of a leading lady .. Going out of her way to get a good press for the leading man. I'm not only his leading lady. I'm his wife. Halford is only my stage name. My husband has no idea I'm here. He would never have let me come. But you can help me. Mr Skeates must be made to go to the play again tomorrow night. Then he'll see my husband give a real performance. We can't do anything. You must realise that. Ann, Ann, Ann. Come on, Ann. Buck up. It's merry Hades in the Comp' room as you haven't sent the review down. Go to press in ten minutes. - Righto, Tommy. I shan't be long. Alright, I'll wait. I want to go to the funfair in Piccadilly Circus. Have some luck and win on the pin-tables, so hurry up. Listen, you can help me. You're the only person who can help me find Mr Skeates. How can I find him at this time of night? But you've got to. I appeal to you as one woman to another. Listen, you're young. Likely don't know what it is to be in love with anyone. But when you do, you'll understand. Oh, please, please find Mr Skeates for me. Alright. I'll see what I can do. I don't know what .. I'll see what I can do. I'll wait outside. This is Mr Skeates' secretary. Is Mr Skeates home yet? Oh. [ Mr Skeates: ] "I don't even read my own articles." Daily Post! Daily Post! Paper! "Daily Post!" Waiter. A pint of bitter. - Yes, sir. In a tankard. Very good, sir. A pint of bitter in the can, for Mr Skeates. Would you point out Mr Skeates to me? Yes, sir. It's the gentleman sitting down under the portrait of Dr Johnson. Thank you. Pardon me. Mr Skeates? - What? My name is Edmond Davey. Forgive this intrusion. I especially wanted to speak to you and I was told you lunch here every day. I suppose you do recognise me? I played Othello last night. May I sit down for a moment? I must thank you, Mr Skeates. You're the only critic who had good words for me. Of what? I know that on last night's performance, I didn't deserve your praise. I was nervous, unsure of myself with my first appearance in London. But your review, coming at a moment when I'd lost every bit of faith in myself .. Was a wonderful encouragement. It was an inspiration. Mr Skeates, allow me to shake you by the hand. Goodbye, and thank you. Don't tell me it's a lovely evening. Miss Williams. I want to speak to you. Mr Skeates, you're here already? - Yes, Miss Williams. I am here already. Do you want to dictate, Mr Skeates? - No. I don't want to dictate, Miss Williams. Well, sensational news today. The eclipse of the sun was prevented by fog and .. And the plenary session of the League of Nations has .. I know, Miss Williams. I know. I've read the paper. Since when do you read the newspapers, Mr Skeates? Since today. - That's what I always say. People shouldn't read newspapers. It just puts them in a bad temper. Ann Williams, what explanation have you to offer me for this? For what, Mr Skeates? - For this. "Concert in the park. Guards' bands play nightly from 7:30 to 10pm." Not that! The article under it. "Opening of the exhibition of ornamental plants." No! This .. this .. this! "Mr Edmond Davey .." "Is the ideal Shakespearian hero for whom we've been waiting for so long." Pah! Miss Williams. Is this Edmond Davey a relation of yours? No .. no, Mr Skeates. He's .. He's no relation of mine. No relation at all. Then you are in love with him? Mr Skeates .. how could you think such a thing? You did something for this man that a woman will only do .. For the man she loves. Put me through to the Staff Manager. That's alright, Mr Skeates. I understand perfectly. I'm going. Goodbye, Mr Skeates. I've .. I've been very happy with you. I'll leave you this for a keepsake. Goodbye. Goodbye. What happened? - What did Mr Skeates say? Just what I expected. Mister Noble, I must have an advance. I haven't a penny. I lost all I had on those slot machines in Piccadilly Circus last night. More, out of sheer gratitude, I'll warn you .. Don't use the one on the left as you go in. You know, the electric football match. It's phony. I shall have the match investigated by Scotland Yard. But first of all, I must have an advance on my salary. Look here, I must have some money! Got anything for me? - For you, Miss Williams? I'll see. Hello, Ann. What are you doing here? What do you think I'm doing in the cashier's office, tap-dancing? Well if it's dough you're after, I can tell you now, it's MTG. I've been reasoning with him for hours to give me an advance on my salary. I'll get my money alright. - It's just come up the manager. Half a week, nine hours overtime, minus health insurance. Makes two pounds, eleven shillings and fourpence. Thank you. There you are Tommy, without any risk or trouble. But what does all this mean? - Shush. I'll lend you some. How much do you want? Ten bob, fifteen bob? I don't borrow money from women. If you let me have a quid, I'll pay you back Saturday night. - Alright. Now why on earth did they give you money and me none? Hey, toad in the hole. How is it other people can get money in advance and I can't? What is this favouritism? Oh shut up, Tommy. This isn't an advance, this is salary. Salary? What, in the middle of the week? Yes, and I shan't get any at the end of the week. Be an angel darling and hand this in to the editor for me. Personal column. What? "Capable young secretary, expert typist, newspaper experience. All office work." I think I'll put "attractive" instead of "capable". It will have more effect. What's all this about? First, you get money in the middle of the week, and then you're writing Ads? It's very simple, Tommy. I've got the sack. You've got the sack? - Are you deaf? I've got the sack. Say it again. Once and for all, I've got the sack. Why have you got the sack? Because Mr Skeates read the paper this morning. Goodbye. That's not legal grounds for dismissal. - It happens, in this case it is. You'll tell me here and now what's been going on. Come on, out with it. Don't shout at me. I'm not your wife or fianc?e or anything. That's the point. Why aren't you my wife or fianc?e or anything? Because I'll never be a wife or fianc?e or anything of anyone who shouts at me. Alright, I'll ask you in a whisper, why did you get the sack? That's very much better and now I'll tell you. I've been shut out on account of Othello. Goodbye. Don't take that seat! I saw it first. You're a lot of rowdy, uncultured barbarians. That's what you are. It's perfectly disgraceful treating people like this. Where are my mints? Where are my mints? Where are my mints? Give me my mints. What's the idea? - I want my mints. It's absolutely a disgrace. Where is my shoe? Where is my shoe? Have you got my shoe? Where is my shoe? I haven't seen your shoe. I'm going to complain to the management. Buy a seat to see a performance, and you get kicked around like a rubber ball. Chocolates .. chocolates. Chocolates? I'd give them poison. How anybody put up with this theatre .. in my opinion .. Here, look what they've done to me. They've ruined my shoes. Three guineas I paid for this at Barkers. Listen! Better take a box next time, dearie. Well I could easily have done it. I'd have only had to say the word. But you couldn't think of the word, could you mate. It's nothing to joke about. I'll let you know that it's thanks to me that Othello is plays here this evening. It says to me Othello ever go wrote. I'm the author, see. It's a silly show anyway. That's where I'm with you, duck. I ain't interested in it either. What's going on in there? Why do the people shout like that? - They ain't people. They're actors. The first act has started. "I fetch my life and being from men of royal siege." "And my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this." Who is that speaking? Treat yourself to a program, duck. It's all inside, you know. Sixpence for the program and sixpence for the hire of the opera glasses. "Aye, to me." "She is abused." "Stolen from me, and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks." "For nature so preposterously to err." "Being not deficient, blind or lame of sense." "Sans witchcraft could not." "Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding .." "Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself." "And you of her?" "The bloody book of law you shall yourself read .." "In the bitter letter after its own sense." "Though our proper son stood in your action." "Humbly, I thank Your Grace." "Here is the man. This Moor." "Now it seems, your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought." "We are very sorry for it." "What in your own part can you say to this?" "Most potent, grave and reverent Signiors." "My very noble and approved good masters." "That I have taken away this old man's daughter. It is most true." "True, I have married her." "The very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more." "Rude am I in my speech and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace." "For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith." "Till now some nine moons wasted." "They have used their dearest action in the tented field." "And little of this great world can I speak .." "More than pertains to feats of broil and battle." "And therefore, little shall I grace my cause in speaking for myself." "Yet, by your gracious patience .." "I will a round unvarnished tale deliver." "Of my whole course of love. What drugs." "What charms." "What conjuration and what mighty magic." "For such proceeding am I charged withal?" "I won his daughter." "Oh now, forever. Farewell the tranquil mind." "Farewell content." "Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue." "Oh, farewell." "Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trumpet." "The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing pipe." "The Royal banner and quality, pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!" "Farewell.." "Othello's occupation's gone." "And in such cases, men's natures wrangle with inferior things." "Though great ones are their object. Nay, it is even so." "For let our finger ache." "And it indues our other more healthful members even to such sense of pain." "Nay, we must think." "Men are not Gods." "Nor of them look to such observances as fit the bridal." "I kiss'd thee .. ere I kill'd thee." "No way but this .. killing myself." "To die .." "Upon a kiss." Hello Edmond, hello Barbara. My dears, it was grand, it was colossal. We've made it. You should hear what they're all saying. The pick of the London public was there and the entire aristocracy. Let me tell you one thing. If Skeates hadn't given that notice, we'd have packed up. We'd have played to rows of empty seats. Yes, I know. Well come along my boy, you've got to meet some people. Miss Williams? How lovely. Miss Halford, I didn't mean to drag you away. But I am delighted to see you. - I saw the play. I simply had to tell you. You were right. He is a great actor. Well, I think so anyway. Thank heavens it's all turned out alright. Look at all the people congratulating him. How do you do, and may I introduce you .. Yes. You must come and have supper with us. Oh but I can't, Miss Halford. I haven't been home yet. I'm still in office clothes. That doesn't matter, really. Here he is. Darling. Barbara, why disappear like that? They want to congratulate you as much as me. It was your success as well as mine. - Oh, don't be so silly. They don't want to see me. It's your big night. That's all that matters to them. For heaven's sake stop being so noble. I can't stand it. I insist on your coming down to the restaurant and showing yourself. But darling, we can't go down now. We have a guest. This is Ann Williams of the Daily Post. My friend. How do you do. How do you do. Katharine, will you tell the waiter to serve supper now. The usual for Mr Davey. I see you're having supper with us. Dry or sweet? Pardon? My husband wants to know whether you want dry or sweet champagne. Oh, the champagne? Well really, I think I prefer sweet. You come and sit here. - Thank you. I'm so sorry. I'm sure you're only having supper upstairs because of me. We always have supper upstairs. Well, tonight's success! - Thank you. Oh, I was thirsty. You've no idea how hot it is up in the gallery. Were you at the theatre? Of course I was. And if you'll let me say so. You were a magnificent Othello. Your love was full of passion. Your jealousy full of rage. You played the great murder scene in the last act so powerfully that .. Miss Williams is quoting Mr Skeates. She's his secretary, darling. Was. What do you mean? Aren't you still his secretary? Not just at present. Certain differences of opinion have arisen between us. Questions of stage technique. So I prefer to retire for a while. You see, my husband doesn't take supper as we do. He has to be very careful. He's on a special diet. Oh that's so humbug, diet and suchlike. Take it from me. The best cure for the stomach is to eat what you jolly please. The more the better. My colleague Tommy Stapleton says most people who diet are being too careful. And Tommy ought to know. He writes the obituaries. Oh .. if he could only see me here now at the Savoy, he would throw a fit. Tommy is frightfully jealous. Just like you, Mr Davey. I mean .. jealous like you as Othello. Not like you .. as you. Is Mr Tommy Stapleton your fianc?e? Oh no fear! He's always badgering me to marry him but I won't. Why not? Oh, I don't know. Tommy is sweet, but .. Well, I don't think it would work out. You see, we're in the same profession .. and .. It's no good for 2 people to get married if they're in the same profession. A man's job ought to be .. Well, a man's job ought to be rather a mystery to a woman. Something that .. Inspires her with respect. How else is a man going to inspire woman with respect if not with his profession? And there's another thing. If they're .. if they do the same job, they are always together, they're .. They are always in each other's pockets and that simply can't last. They are bound to get on each other's nerves in no time. Present company always excepted, of course. Oh dear. I feel so funny. It must be the champagne. Oh, it would be lovely to walk home. Along by Hyde Park. And the grass smells so delicious. If you must walk home, I'll come with you. I don't think it's a good idea. Remember how careful you must be. The night air. Your solicitude is very flattering, Barbara. We can't expect Ann to walk home alone at this hour. I wasn't suggesting she walk home alone. If you object to my walking, I'll take her in a taxi. Now you are being absolutely ridiculous. A draughty taxi late at night. She's perfectly alright. She's not a baby. You're making me uncomfortable. Anyone would think I were an invalid. Darling, you would be if I didn't take care of you. Put your fork down. Very well. But somebody has got to take her home. I shall take the young lady home. Thank you. Thank you so much. And don't forget. Best love from me and thanks for a lovely supper. And au revoir, au revoir. Oh that champagne, that champagne. Whee .. ooh. There must have been something in that champagne. Where is my key? Here is the key. Tommy! Hello, Ann. Tommy, what are you doing here? I'm waiting for the girl I was once in love with. Oh Tommy, what does she look like? Do you happen to have a photograph of her in your pocket? No, I haven't a photograph of her. But I've got a photograph of someone else. Someone thoughtless, unkind and debauched. Debauched? That was the champagne. Oh, there must have been something in that champagne. Tommy, what's this? The tangible proof that you don't love me, Ann. But it's cigarettes. - You're right. Cigarettes. I didn't buy them, I won them. I won them at the funfair at Piccadilly. The machine on the left as you go in. You know, the electric football match? That told me everything. If you're lucky at that phony football match, you must be unlucky in love. My dear Tommy, I fail to see the slightest connection between love .. And Piccadilly Circus. Ann, grant me one last favour. Give this to the new obituary man in the morning. What do you mean, the new obituary man? My last article. "Obituary. It is with deepest regret .." "That We announce the sudden demise of our esteemed colleague .." "On the editorial staff of our paper." "Who was carried off in the prime of life by a broken heart." "Mr Thomas Newbiggin Stapleton." Tommy, is your middle name "Newbiggin"? "Newbiggin"? Really? Tommy, that's marvellous. Newbiggin. In the future, I shall always call you Newbiggin. Goodnight, my dear Newbiggin. - You stop and hear what I have to say. I saw Skeates. He told me you're infatuated by that actor. I think it's pretty disgusting and silly for a girl like you .. To get all romantic about a man who blackens his face every night. Like Al Jolson. "You are abused." "Stolen from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought off mountebanks." That's nonsense. It's not nonsense. It's Shakespeare. Act 1. Scene 3. Tommy .. Tommy. Tommy. - Oh, Mrs Williams. Worthy relic to the worthy Captain W. Williams, deceased. Late of the Canadian Mounted Police invested with the British Empire medal. "Your daughter .. I say again, hath made a gross revolt." "Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortune in an extravagant wheeling stranger." "Of here and everywhere." Tommy, have you gone mad? You are waking all my lodgers. - Oh. "From hence, trust not your daughters' minds by what you see them act." Shut up! It must be something in the champagne. [ Telephone ] Hello. Hello. Hello? Who's there? Who is it? Hello? Mister Skeates. So when one wants to find one's secretary. One, either has to go to the theatre. To Othello .. or to the Royal Academy. Mr Skeates, it is simply by chance. You mustn't think that I'm always here. - No. Your Edmond Davey has taken the town by storm. His picture hangs in the Royal Academy. In the offices of the film companies. And in the hearts of the women. - But Mr Skeates. - Ah .. I am bound to admit .. that Edmond Davey is a great actor. The old critic was wrong. The young heart was right. But Mr Skeates, you're mistaken. At the time I .. altered your review. I didn't even know him. But you loved him unconsciously at the time. Every woman unconsciously loves every man on earth. Though she may not know him personally. Consequently, when she meets him. That love .. functions .. automatically. Mr Skeates. Tell me what to do. You know more about life than I do. I've never been in a situation like this before. You must put the whole thing out of your mind. Why, the fellow is married. Now go to the country for .. for a fortnight. To the Cotswolds. Take your fishing rod with you. Have a good rest. Fishing. Then come back to us. And the newspaper. You are absolutely right, Mr Skeates. Of course. You are absolutely right. Ann, dear. This telegram came for you a little while ago. A telegram? Maybe it is an answer to my advertisement. Miss Williams. You're here already. Listen, will you go in and wait. I shan't be a minute. There's something very important. I am so sorry. But Miss Halford ..? This way, Miss. Barbara. Barbara. Barbara! Hello. Give me the hall porter, will you. It is Mr Davey speaking. Is my wife downstairs? She's just gone out? I see, thank you. Give me the hall porter again. Listen, there is a young lady coming to see my wife. Now tell her Miss Halford is not in. Send her away, send her away. Say she is very sorry, but she is .. What? She's been shown up? Well, where is she? Here I am. I'm terribly sorry. I had no idea you .. - But I had no idea that you .. And did .. Did you hear what I said over the phone just now? - Yes. Yes. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Oh. Are these for me? No, they are for your wife. I came a few minutes ago. Mrs Halford had to go out. She asked me to wait. She said she'd be back soon. She was looking for something, but .. I couldn't understand what she was looking for. Yes. I think I understand. I'm accustomed to it from her. You see, in private life the parts are reversed. Desdemona is the jealous one. Othello is the victim. Poor Barbara .. she always thinks I'm with another woman. She'll be glad when she gets back and sees there's no reason to be jealous. No reason? I'm not so sure. I really am with another woman. Why, you are .. - Here. With you. Yes, I know you are. But .. It isn't that kind of thing. I'm not dangerous. Well, how can you possibly say that about yourself? Whether a woman is dangerous or not depends entirely on the man. You're dangerous to me. So dangerous, that I went out just now when I heard you were coming. My danger must have passed off quickly, since you came back almost at once. I can't explain it. I hardly got to the street when I felt I had to come back. I expect it was too hot for you in the street and you were thirsty. Will you have some tea? - Yes, I was thirsty. But not for tea. Since the night you had supper with us, I've often thought about you. About your simplicity, your laugh. You must have some tea or some orangeade. Stay here .. you're something completely new to me. Something I've never known. For me, you're the .. The representative of the great public. The symbol of the unreserved seat. The gallery. With its capacity for enthusiasm. I've never had personal contact with the public. I'm cut off from the outside world by my wife. But your wife loves you. I've seen the way she looks at you. - Yes. She loves me, she .. Takes care of me. She looks after me. But a man sometimes needs a woman who loves him differently. Differently? As you love me, for instance. As I love you ..? What do you mean? I'll answer that question another time. Don't look round. My wife is just coming into the room. What? Pull yourself together. Smile. Edmond, you're here. Miss Williams, I am so sorry. You see, I was obliged to .. Well, I had to .. I've been trying to entertain our guest while you were away. How about some tea? I came back on purpose because I was thirsty. Yes .. tea. I am so sorry, Miss Halford. I'm afraid I can't stay any longer. I've got to get back to the office. Mr Skeates is expecting me. You're back with Mr Skeates? I am glad. - Yes, I am back. I'm sorry you must go, but you must come another afternoon. Tomorrow or Sunday? I'm afraid I can't. We're frightfully busy at the office just now. Goodbye. Darling, how can you put up with a wife like me? You know, I believe she's hurt, because I kept her waiting. Run after her and say something nice for me, will you. Of course I will. If I can catch her. You? What do you want? - I followed you. Barbara sent me. I'm to say something nice to you. I don't want to hear any more from you. You go away and leave me alone. Anyone might see us here in the park. Hyde Park belongs to the lovers of London. So Hyde Park belongs to us. You are absolutely crazy. We are not lovers. You sort of, sort of .. Fascinate me, but that's because you're a great artist. I'm not only an artist. I'm a man and I want to be loved as a man. What good is it to me to sit here as you say I fascinate you as a great artist? How can you talk like that? We've only been together once before in our lives. Oh, I've been with you much more often. That night, remember? I walked home with you in the spirit. We went on foot by Hyde Park palings. The grass smelt so delicious. You're mistaken. I drove home with your maid. The taxi reeked of petrol. Aren't we together every evening for hours? Othello on the stage, and you in the gallery. How can you say that? You can't possibly have seen me. I don't see you, but I feel you. Your eyes seem to burn down into mine. My eyes. It's the lenses of my opera glasses. I wanted to send you a box, but I was afraid of frightening you away. I wish you had. At least it would have made the gallery attendants sit up. And after every act, I always heard your hands out of the thousands .. clapping. You'll feel my hands clapping in a minute. Don't move, don't move! Pardon me just one moment. Please stay just as you are. Or you will spoil my little picture. Poor old thing. If you won't stay for my sake, at least give her a chance. Just for the foreground. I've nearly finished. Nearly finished. Listen here, Mr Davey. I confess quite openly. Yes .. I do love you .. but .. I've never taken anything belonging to anyone else and I never will. And you belong to someone else and to a woman I think very highly of .. Just because she loves you. You won't be taking anything away from her, Ann. I've got to make you understand. I'm not an unscrupulous scoundrel .. Who simply leaves his wife when he finds someone he likes better, but .. I'm only human and I can't fight against my own heart. I don't want to leave my wife, but I don't want to leave you either. Oh, this isn't just an ordinary selfish seduction, Ann. I need you to keep me sane. You don't know what it's like to be persecuted by jealousy. We've got to be together sometimes. Anywhere where I can find you when I need you. A little flat out in Hampstead. A room, a house. Anywhere you like. Somewhere where I can get you when I can't bear it any longer. And find you alone .. waiting for me. That's every man's ideal picture. "Alone and waiting for me." Every man's geometry. The triangle. Himself at the apex and two women, right and left, at his feet. And you tell me this isn't an ordinary selfish seduction? When you're bored with the Savoy you'll come to Hampstead. When you're bored with Hampstead you'll go back to the Savoy. No, no, no, my dear Mr Edmond Davey. I'm not participating in that combination. Goodbye, Mr Davey! Shall I see you again? - Never! Be at the theatre tonight at 8:30. - Never again. Tomorrow, here. Same time. I'll be waiting. Then you will wait forever! Ann, dear. I should so like to see Mister Edmond Davey as Othello. Won't you please take me with you when you go this evening? I'm sorry, Miss Wall, I'm not going. You are not going this evening? - No, not going this evening. Or tomorrow or the day after or ever, ever in all my life! [ Radio: Othello ] "Most potent, grave and reverend Signiors." "My very noble and approved good masters." "That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, it is most true." "True, I have married her." "The very head and front of my offending hath this extent, no more." "Rude am I in my speech, and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace." "For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith .." "Till now some nine moons wasted." "They have used their dearest action in the tented field." "And little of this great world can I speak more than pertains to feats .." "And therefore, little shall I grace my cause." "Yet, by your gracious patience." "I will a round, unvarnished tale deliver." "Of my whole course of love." "What blood, what charm." "What conjuration and what mighty magic." "For such proceedings I am charged withal." "I won his daughter." "Her father loved me, oft invited me." "Still question'd me the story of my life, from year to year." "The battles, sieges, fortunes, that I have passed." No, no! No, no, no, no .. no! No .. no! [ Car radio: ] "She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd." "And I loved her, that she did pity them." "This only is the witchcraft I have used." I knew you'd come. It is too bad that the sun is not shining, today of all days. You realize now that we belong together, Ann? Yes. And you know now that it is better for three people to be happy together .. Than for all three to be unhappy apart. Yes. May I take that place in Hampstead? Yes. Who's there? Katie, there's a lady to see Miss Halford. Miss Halford hasn't come yet. I wanted to speak to Miss Halford. - What is your business? Well, I wanted to offer her something for sale. I heard she was a connoisseur of pictures. We are not connoisseurs of pictures. It is a real bargain. Practically a gift. Oh .. I am convinced that madam will be interested. We are not interested. But I am sure madam will be charmed. It is an idyll .. made in Hyde Park. We don't care for .. idylls. There. So pretty. So sweet. The green grass, the lake, the loving couple in the foreground. All so true to nature. Young man, young lady. Great love. What does the picture cost? - Thirty pounds. And cheap at the price. Dirty cheap. I could get twice that if I went to a newspaper. You see, the gentleman in the picture is celebrated. I recognised him at once. Although he wasn't made up black on this occasion. I am sure Mrs Edmond Davey .. Would be willing to pay thirty pounds for such a pretty picture. If you can persuade her, I'll give you ten percent. Ten percent? - Yes, that's three pounds. Three pounds. Well .. Would you give me five pounds? Five pounds? Alright, five pounds. That leaves twenty-five pounds for you. Mercy! What have you done? With that hole in it, the picture is worth ten pounds less. It only costs fifteen pounds now. And there is another hole! - Why, you're mad! Give it to me. My picture! And now it's worth another ten pounds less. And I keep the picture. I'm going to fetch the police. You're mad. I'll stop you! And just let me tell you this. I tell you I'll give you some excitement about this picture if you don't get out. You good for nothing, blackmailing old hag! You vixen you! Miss Williams. I've came to you as I came to you once before. About my husband. I'm afraid I've no time, Miss Halford. Mr Skeates may be in at any moment and I .. I don't want to lose my job for the second time. I'm sure that Mr Skeates won't mind when he hears that it was I who detained you. Well. What can I do for you, Miss Halford? My husband is in love with another woman. And I've come to ask you to speak to the girl he loves. And tell her that she mustn't take him from me. But why must I be the one to tell her that? Because you helped me once before. And because I feel that you are the only decent person in this business. Tell her she's got to give him up. To her, perhaps it is only an adventure. But to me, it means my .. whole life. Oh. And suppose this girl .. Really loves him? Suppose it isn't .. Just an adventure for her? Then she must give him up just the same. Not because I'm his wife. That would be an empty reason for trying to hold him, however much I loved him. But .. But? We're going to have a child. Does your husband know? No, I haven't told him yet. I couldn't tell him while he was thinking of another woman. Thank you for coming straight to me. Miss Halford. You shall have your husband back. Why didn't Ann .. Why didn't Miss Williams come to see me herself? I suppose she thought what's written in black and white .. Can't be so easily retracted as the spoken word. Did she want an answer? - Nope. You are wondering what I'm waiting for, I suppose? I wouldn't have put it quite so bluntly. - I would. And I'll answer bluntly, too. I'm waiting to see your famous face after you've read the letter. I understand. You are Tommy Stapleton. Ann's colleague on the newspaper. I work in the office next to her. "I'm absolutely firm in my resolution. It has to be over between us.." "You belong to Barbara as long as she lives." You wanted to see my face. Well. Here is my face. Thanks. That will do. Anyhow, I'm glad to have met you. Perhaps you'll hear from me shortly. Something of interest to your paper. Delighted. I write the obituaries. "As long as .." Mr Davey! What is it? Mr Davey, please. Miss Halford has rung up from the theatre to see if you're still here. It is 8 o'clock you see and the performance will soon begin. Tell her I'm on my way. I'm coming now. Very good, sir. "As long as .." "As long as she lives." Kitty, I can't understand why he's so late. He's usually in before this. Good evening, Mr Davey. Good evening, Mr Davey. Kitty, he didn't come in. He's gone straight into his room. How extraordinary. Matches. Bring me the whiskey you were hiding. I beg your pardon, sir? - The whiskey. The whiskey? - Whiskey! Very good, sir. Hello Mr Skeates, I'm looking for Ann. Oh, she's finished with the dark horse. The worthy daughter of Captain Williams has returned from darkest Africa. Honestly, Mr Skeates. I can't understand Ann. I had a look at this Othello, in white I admit, but .. I can't imagine how she fell for him. What did he say to the letter? - Say? He didn't say anything. He just smiled. Like this. Ah .. like that? - Yes. Now listen, Mr Skeates, you're an expert in the theatre. Wouldn't you think that a fine, known actor would be able to do more than .. Just produce a thin smile? Ann .. Ann .. Ann! Mr Skeates, where is Ann? - Ann is not here. She's at the theatre. I thought she wasn't going anymore. She wanted to see him. For the last time.

Let me go. Curtain! Quick, curtain! Edmond. Barbara. Someone get a doctor! Here she is. I've had my eye on the girl all evening. Shush. Katie, shut that door. Here, take this. Ann, it's alright. Ann, they've all gone. You're alright now. Pull yourself together. Shush. It's alright, doctor .. it's .. It's only nerves. I'll take care of her. Thank you so much, doctor. Ann. Please, everything is quite alright. Ann. Now listen. It's alright. They've all gone now. But you mustn't go on acting. Not tonight or tomorrow. Not ever. Alright. I promise. And if I'd had my way she'd have stopped a long while ago. A woman in her condition. Barbara. It's nothing, dear. Take no notice of Katharine. - Nonsense. He's got to know sooner or later. Why didn't you tell me before? Why? Why? You want me to answer that question? Why? Oh .. Why. Oh you fool. Barbara. That comes of not looking at my knitting. Or you might have seen for yourself. Ah .. there you are, ducks. Feeling better now, eh? What a shamozzle. Ha. Now here's your little bits and pieces. I found them upstairs. Thank you. - Anything I can do for you? No thank you. No, Edmond. Don't explain anything. I've nothing to forgive you for. When things go wrong between husband and wife. The wife is always just as much to blame as the husband. Oh no. - Yes. 0h my dear, there is so much truth in the words I say every night on stage. "Men are not Gods." And now. Now go and find Ann. And say something nice to her. Now you go home and have a good sleep. You'll be alright in the morning. Ahem. That's not the way out, Miss. This is. Thank you. You've saved me from doing something terrible. You must forget it. It's all straight between you and Barbara now. She'll have her child to mother. But .. what will become of you? I shall go on being .. What you once said I was. The representative of the gallery. The symbol of the unreserved seat. The enthusiastic audience. And applause. Ladies and gentlemen. I much regret to have to inform you. That Miss Halford and Mr Davey have been .. So upset by the unexpected occurrence which you have just witnessed. That they are quite unable to go on with this evening's performance. I hope that you will .. I hope perhaps that even Shakespeare may forgive us. If .. on this occasion only. We allow Desdemona to live. Thank you so much. [ Singing: ] "Long live our gracious King."
