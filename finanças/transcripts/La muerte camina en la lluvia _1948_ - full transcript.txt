Death Walks in the Rain Good evening, friends. It's raining... and once again death is out on the streets and the shadows crouch in ambush. Yes, my friends, death walks in the rain. This is no mere literary phrase. It's a painful, brutal, incredible reality that makes Buenos Aires shudder in fear. Who is S. Lopez? Who is the raging criminal who kills in the rain and leaves his calling card as if he just finished a work of art and left his signature? Is he a morbid exhibitionist? A paranoiac? Let's leave the theory of man and beast to the cinema. S. Lopez kills in order to rob. And he acts so diabolically that having committed 6 crimes in only 3 months, no one has even a minimal clue as to his identity. Fear is driven like a claw into the heart of the city. It's raining tonight, my friends. Is S. Lopez already on the streets, stalking that unfortunate who chance will make his seventh victim? S. Lopez Sows Terror The usual, a fractured skull produced by a blackjack. That's S. Lopez. Why this absurd interest in signing each crime, doctor? Is it logical that after killing in the open street, where the loss of seconds could be fatal, he risk precious time to leave this infantile challenge? Believe me, Mr.Lima, S. Lopez is going too far. His daring will destroy him. On the contrary, Morales, it's his best ally. He's intoxicated by crime, nothing will be capable of stopping him. His entire radius of action is confined to Palermo and Belgrano. After the third crime the patrols there were doubled, and reinforced at the least sign of rain. All agents have orders to question and even search all solitary walkers. As for boarding houses, hotels, etc., they've been ordered to report any guests whose conduct appears suspicious. As you can see, we're taking all the possible measures. Very well. Understood, sir. Furious? What do you think, these damn newspapers! They're revealed that I'm offering a reward for clues. On Malabia Street, despite the heightened security, last night the cynical criminal claimed a new victim. This calls for a removal of the corresponding authorities. Morales! Yes, sir? Removal of the corresponding authorities! Who's the police reporter for Clarin? Lucho Rivas, the little Chilean. He's a smart guy... Well if he keeps this up we'll quarantine him! I doubt that's his headline. He's a good friend of ours. Anyway, all the papers point out our powerlessness. Come in! What's up, chief? What do you say about this? I didn't write it, I assure you. What's up, Morales? A storm? Don't look at me with those eyes like an automatic pistol. In two minutes you'll be sorry you ever doubted me. Chief, I have the news of the century. What's it about? Ah, I'm counting on your discretion. My duty here was to betray my paper and delay my promotion. But my boss wouldn't understand. Come in. Barquinazo! The pianist Barquinazo. But will you tell what this is all about! It means, chief, that this hardworking kleptomaniac... has come to give you the address where... S. Lopez lives. When the music stopped, I didn't know what to do. I was afeared real bad, ready to split, when the door opened again. I hid, and saw someone else come out. Would you recognize him? He recognized him. Who was it? Me. What? You two came here just to pull my leg? No, chief. What Barquinazo said is true. He followed me to Clarin and offered to sell me his secret. I told him you'd pay better. Within a half hour the police will announce an offer of 5,000 pesos in exchange for useful information. Five large? Do you withhold 8 percent for retirement? Hold the bullshit and just talk! S. Lopez lives on Huerfanos Street number 21. And in that very same house...lives my girlfriend. What are you saying? Nothing but the truth. It's clear that S. Lopez slipped into his room while Valeria Duval, who you will soon meet, played a catchy bolero on the piano. The only people present were my girlfriend and me. The other tenants had already gone to bed. What tenants? Don't you understand, chief? Number 21 is a rooming house. Answer the front door! Go answer the door, Goodluck! Yes, Ma'am. Do you want breakfast, Mr. Norton? This will be my masterpiece, Mrs. Duval. This time I'll pay you the six months, without fail. I've been inspired by this thing. By S. Lopez the Exterminator. I'll call it Death Walks in the Rain. What do you think? I don't see S. Lopez. Who sees death, Ma'am? And now, if you'll allow me, I'll draw three swirls on my cafe au lait. The man wants to talk to you. Did you ask who he is? No. Heh... Okay, serve breakfast to Mr. Norton. Good morning. Good morning, Ma'am. This is the Babel Rooming House, no? I'm Professor Hermenegildo Miranda. Didn't Mr. Camelio Vargas mention me? You're the new tenant! Excuse me, sir. Good luck! It's the maid's name. Ma'am? Show the gentleman to his room. I've had it ready for you since yesterday. Good morning! Mr. Boris Andreyev. Professor Miranda, our new guest. Mr. Miranda. Babel, in ancient Aramaic, means The Gates of Heaven. You'll soon see how our hostess empties the gold from her pockets and the blood from her heart to serve you. At your service! A great pleasure, sir. Excuse me. Would you be so kind, my dear Valeria, as to ensure these shoes turn your eyes misty with their shine? At your service, Boris. Ah, Mr. Andreyev. Wouldn't you like me to serve you breakfast in your room? [Russian] I'd never permit myself to cause you such troubles. I'll eat in the dining room. Mrs. Duval! The magician has swallowed a sword. What happened, Mr. Merlin? Can you come up for a minute? What don't you come down? I order you to come up, Ma'am. Unless you prefer to do so under hypnosis! See that? What a man, Mr. Andreyev! Indo...hah! Hindu, yes! In India, my homeland, I learned to dialog with the mystery. I'm not a fake, like you! What did you say? Remember you're speaking to an actor! One chosen by god! The phony is you! Ahh, I'm on my way, Mr. Merlin! Don't irritate the Hindu, next time he'll have better aim. Hindu? Hah! I swear he's not so much as seen a map of India! Please be so kind as to knock here with your hammerlike knuckles. Anyone there? That's what I'd like to know. You're the psychic! She hasn't died, has she? No, I haven't died. I speak, therefore I exist. Then I remind you that a gentleman, even if he is Hindu, do not spy through the keyhole while an honest woman takes a bath. I've met some honest women, but none who spent an hour in the bathroom. Camelio, did you hear? What? What this fakir said! What did he say? One moment, my good man! He who now bathes is me. Why don't you insist on your rights? If he did that to me I'd pull his turban down around his molars! But woman, humanity has suffered enough already. Why keep fighting? Ah, Mr. Vargas, a minute ago your friend arrived. The professor? I'll go say hello. Excuse me, dear. Then come help me brush my hair! Come in! Good morning, Miss Espinosa, breakfast is ready. I'll be right down. Do you know they've agreed to publish my novel? Yes, congratulations. So you'll leave the ad agency? No, Mrs. Valeria, why? They pay me well for each slogan. Yesterday they bought another: 'If you don't want her to cry, don't make her fly standby.' Excuse me. Here is your watch, Miss Lila, it works divinely. Thank you, Mr. Lamas. Although I don't know why you need to know the time. For a young girl in love, time is a dream. To dream...to wait... For what else is a woman born? To prepare us breakfast too. Your shine is not due to your wit. To the dining room! You're going out, professor? You already ate? Yes, Ma'am. You came just for water? Yes, I detest the vibration of the airplane, Vargas. I love the velvet of the water... You won't spend all day in the bath? Here everyone has to bathe. Oh, don't worry, Ma'am. Excuse me. Good day, doctor. Good day, Mrs. Duval. Dr. Robledo? What do you want? I've told you not to talk to me about those damn bonds! Don't get angry, doctor, I just wanted to introduce you to the new tenant. Dr. Miranda, who's come from Uruguay to give a lecture. Aha. Dr. Robledo, ex Army surgeon. One of the most coveted hands in the country. It's such a pleasure, doctor. Do you still practice? No! S. Lopez committed his seventh crime. When? Last night, six blocks from here. The radio just announced it. The police offered 5,000 pesos to whoever provides valuable information. It seem they think S. Lopez should also be paid a Christmas bonus. But naturally he will not turn himself in. He'll prefer to look for that sum in the pockets of his victims. Don't you think so, professor? Professor Miranda? Yes? You'll have to come with me. I don't know you, sir. That's not necessary. S. Lopez could be any of the tenants. And it's naive to think he may have evidence is his building. We'll just end up warning him. But he's not infallible and can commit an error. That's why we need an observer inside the house... To closely watch the tenants and give us a daily report on their movements. But I... I'm a scientist, not an investigator. Your arrival at the rooming house is opportune. And you'll run no risk, the house is surrounded by detectives and plainclothes agents. Mr. Miranda, the service you can render is immense! But...it's that... living under the same roof as a murderer... it's horrible. I suffer from insomnia... now with this, I'll never recover. You refuse? Ahh... You must decide, professor. We can't afford to lose even a minute. S. Lopez will soon discover you're watching him. Professor? Ma'am? What's wrong? I'm...I'm very sorry. But I need to leave...to return to Montevideo. You just arrived and you're already leaving? Circumstances... Excuse me. Are you not happy with this house...with me? On the contrary, Ma'am. But you'll at least eat with us, no? Well...sure, okay. Excuse me. Don't bother, I'll get it. Thank you, doctor. Hello, Babel House. Lucho! How are you, dear? Listen, and don't repeat any of what I tell you. Are you alone? Good, listen. S. Lopez lives in Babel House. You don't say! Lila, I'm serious. I swear it. The house is surrounded, later I'll explain. No, not tonight. I promised the police I wouldn't go there tonight. Yes, tomorrow. Go to your room and don't open the door for anyone. Understood? I'll call you early tomorrow, dear. Happy? Ah, men! Why would they be naive in their lies, doctor? Naivety is a masculine privilege, miss. You see, my boyfriend can't come tonight. A party, I imagine. You know what pretext he chose? Only Merlin could guess. The imagination of one in love... is as delirious as that of a criminal. Ah, now I understand how Lucho could have made up that fantasy. Do you think, doctor, that S. Lopez lives in Babel House? My calcium! My calcium has disappeared! Merlin! Mr. Merlin! Be nice, give it back, Mr. Merlin. But I don't have it! I swear, Miss Lila... Wait. Let's see... You're insolent! Camelio! Did you see that? The magician framed me! The truth is that you don't need it. Camelio! Borscht! No, Mr. Lamas does not eat beet soup. I suffer from antonism. You could have chosen another moment to fix your watch. Goodluck, serve me Mr. Lamas' ration. For two plates of borsht, I'm ready to convert to Bolshevikism. No, thank you. You're not eating, professor? It appears that the professor has a contracted diaphragm. Don't worry, Mrs. Duval, I'll eat the professor's ration. Thank you, Mr. Andreyev. You look sad, my dear lady. No, no. Oh... Or better said, yes. The professor is abandoning us this very night! What? What's that news, Miranda? Don't talk while you eat, Camelio. Shut up! I must go, Vargas. I think the professor is afraid of us. We disgust him, perhaps. What an idea, Mrs. Duval! Are we that repugnant? Maybe the professor thinks that S. Lopez lives in Babel House. Doctor! What do you mean by that? Perhaps you don't know who is S. Lopez? A... A.... Say it without hesitation, professor. A murderer! The cruelest that Buenos Aires has ever known! 7 crimes in only 3 months. As you can see, an excellent average! Next to him, Leviathan was a suckling baby. I've just arrived from Paysandu. I seldom read the papers. I think that... he kills in the rain. As the pine distills its resin, the stone forest of the city distills crime. S. Lopez wanders in the rain, Following his victim like a wolf... He raises his arm and... You appear to be admirably well-informed. And I don't even have memory like Mr. Merlin. My faculties far exceed those of a mere memorist, Mr. Andreyev. You're a friend of S. Lopez, perhaps? Even more, my dear fakir, S. Lopez, is me! That's a terrible joke, Andreyev! You shouldn't speak like that. Pardon me, my dear lady. He who laughs embellishes in gold the brief book of their existence. Excuse me, but I must pack my suitcase. Prepare the bill, Ma'am. Ma'am? Bring me Mr. Miranda's bill. Right away, Ma'am. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? Finally! What have you been doing for so long up there? Ah... Shut up! Come death, and welcome, Juliet wills it so! Let's talk, my love. It is not yet day. A kiss. Farewell. Farewell. Be gone. Coming, coming! Solitary! Why did you take so long? Because... Don't make excuses! Bring the bill to the professor! No! Wait! I'll bring it to him. Goodluck! Have you seen my rubber gloves? They should be in your room, doctor. I looked for them, and they're not there. I thought you'd have taken them for washing. I'll ask the Madame. Professor? A Respite for S. Lopez? What? His eighth crime? Where, did you say? Who's speaking? S. Lopez? You're speaking with Heddy Lamarr. How are you, my lovely? Hello? Hello! A joke! Clarin. One moment, sir. It's for you, Lucho. Thanks. Who is it? Oh death, you call us with your silent voice. Somber, in love... Andreyev! Be respectful for once in your life. There's a dead man in the house. So, Mr. Merlin? Miss Espinosa was by my side. It's true. I think Mr. Merlin didn't leave. But...I was reading and... You could have gotten distracted, no? And the gentleman is a magician, and could have made himself disappear, no? Mr. Merlin, where were you born? ...a city in Bengal. Good evening. My dear, I'm so happy you've come. It's terrible. To think that this afternoon I thought you were joking. What's up Rivas? Thanks, Morales, for getting me in here. Lima authorized it. How did it happen? Excuse me. He was killed with a scalpel. The killer used rubber gloves that he later destroyed. We found residues in the boiler in the kitchen. That's all. Where's the chief? Upstairs, with Kaplan, the coroner. Doctor? He must have been killed between 10 and 10:30. Instant death? Everything points to that conclusion. No fingerprints, sir. Imagine that! This scalpel, the burnt gloves, all seems to point to Robledo as the killer. But also to a clumsy ruse to frame him. And this damn card! Why this absurd interest in signing each crime? Goodbye, chief! Well said, goodbye! Am I bothering you? Sorry, Rivas, we're in a labyrinth. What do you need? Did you see Morales? Yes, he's downstairs. Torres, tell him to send me Andreyev. Come, doctor. Why did it occur to him to paint this? Ask Rembrandt why it occurred to him to paint The Anatomy Lesson. Or Murillo, The Submission of the Virgin. Freedom...is free. No one asked you anything. By the way, haven't you got anything more manly to entertain yourself with? I know of nothing more effective for an active spirit. Morales, the chief orders Mr. Andreyev up to see him. Don't permit anyone to touch my embroidery, Mr. Inspector. Mrs. Duval... And the chief, Rivas? He's in Dr. Robledo's room. Surprised, young Sherlock Holmes? For the first time, S. Lopez kills with a scalpel? And without rain? It seems to have been an urgent killing. No? Or committed with the desire to get the attention of the police. With which intention, Andreyev? Ask the magician. S. Lopez...is Arcadia himself. There's no doubt. They took it from here. Sir? Boris Andreyev at your orders. Russian? Siberian. Your accent makes me suspect otherwise. I've been vaccinated in all the world's cities. An artist has no homeland. After eating, did you go up to your room? For a second. To get my embroidering. Did you see anyone? Yes, Lamas. He's the watchmaker, sir, the tenant who left after the crime. Did you see anyone else? Dr. Robledo. You have a dangerous memory, my dear Andreyev. May I retire? Yes. [speaking Russian], doctor. Do you recognize this, doctor? Nothing looks so much like a scalpel...than another scalpel. It belongs to your case. What are you suggesting? No one kills with a weapon whose very nature can accuse the killer. It would be risky...but wieldy. And the doctor is a very skilled surgeon. What motive could I have to eliminate that poor old man? I'm a doctor, but I don't practice. We know why you can't practice. In that unfortunate case that ended your career as a surgeon, you weren't very...compassionate. You're mistaken, sir. It was my compassion for a woman that ruined my life. Why did you go up to your room after dinner? To get some digestive pills. I ran into Andreyev, as you know. I almost forgot! Today, after lunch, Lamas showed interest in seeing my scalpel case. Did you show it to him? Right here! He seemed to be an expert. Why did you go up to your room after eating? To look for some old letters I wanted to destroy. And why did you leave after the professor's corpse was discovered? I felt bad and went to the pharmacy to get a sedative. Why didn't you ask Dr. Robledo? It didn't occur to me, I was so scared. Accompany him upstairs. Mr. Vargas, why did you go to the kitchen? Ahh... Calm yourself, Camelio. The gentleman is not going to eat you. Take all the time you need to reflect. But for the love of god, don't say anything stupid! Answer me without thinking, young man! Why did you go? Ah...to smoke. Oh, the doctor prohibited it! Cigarettes attack his chest. Bu...bu...but I didn't smoke. I thought I heard footsteps and thought tha...tha...that my wife was coming. Was it your wife? Answer! No, no, sir. It was Lamas. Why did you ask doctor Robledo to show you his case? No, that's not true! He denies having been in my room! Do you think I could make up so stupid a lie? The scalpel is yours. My god! I have a witness! Andreyev! He passed by as Lamas was entering my room. We exchanged greetings. Is it true, or is it not true? Must I call Mr. Andreyev? No, no. I swear I didn't come here on purpose. The conversation turned to surgery and.... Morales! Why did you go to the kitchen after dinner? To burn some old letters in the boiler. Didn't you notice a smell of burnt rubber? No, I have a bad cold. I didn't notice it. You're a perfect liar! Chief! Come here! How strange! They look like letters. They are letters, chief. When I showed them to the maid she said she had never seen them before. Just yesterday she shined the table and prepared the room for the new tenant. Could Professor Miranda have stolen a few seconds from death? Personally, I'd bet not. You'd lose, doctor. The professor, who hardly knew the tenants by name, remembered some particularity of the killer in his last seconds. He didn't manage to finish the word. A 'w'... ...'w'... What do you think it means, sir? A posthumous accusation...the watchmaker! Chief? The dead man's money is missing, no? Yes, we found his wallet empty. Well then, I think I know where he hid the money. Are you coming in? No, dear. I'm running to Clarin. You see? Your work steals at least 3 kisses from us. But it seems to me that Valeria is losing a tenant. Or gaining a new one. See you soon, dear. Call me. It seems a bit expensive. Is that what the dead man was paying? That's what he was paying. Good afternoon, Mrs. Valeria. Good afternoon. Who would have thought it? You saw him come in full of life. And I saw him leave full of death! What else do you want to know, Ma'am? You seem very happy, Miss Lila. I am, Ma'am. They just named my boyfriend Editor in Chief. Congratulations! And Mr. Vargas? He went out to buy me a girdle. To be, or not to be. That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. To die, to sleep, No more. Checkmate! Lost again, Dr. Robledo? It's impossible to beat Andreyev! He smokes constantly to distract his opponent, blowing smoke in his face! A limp impedes smooth walking. But a cough does not. This is terrible, I can't take it any more! What's the trouble, my dear lady? People, Mr. Andreyev! Since they arrested this damn Lamas, the house is full of snoopers. But none takes a room. All day I'm up and down the stairs! You should tell the police, Mrs. Duval. The street is full of them, you can't even go out. This morning a rude journalist insisted on asking my opinion on the Boca vs. River match! Well, the scandal has been good to me. Making you even more beautiful. There's nothing like fear to beautify a woman. Please, Andreyev. I mean that Radio Splendid has offered me an audition entitled 'Alone with S. Lopez.' See you later. Mr. Merlin, how elegant! Scandal attracts, Miss Espinosa. They've hired me at the casino! Great, we'll get in free. And you'll write me an ad slogan. I'd love to! Your destiny you'd like to know? See Merlin in the casino. That's it! No raincoat, Mr. Merlin? It's raining cats and dogs! Rain? Your sword, my dear magician? Why? I no longer have a need to stick in through S. Lopez! Marvelous confidence! My divinatory faculties never fail. I always suspected Lamas! Good afternoon! Offensive jokes... are still your weakness, Andreyev. On the contrary. I was speaking seriously. They arrested Lamas four days ago... and he still denies he's S. Lopez. He'll soon confess. And what if he were innocent, my dear doctor? Did you know the professor? No! Then why did you kill him? I...I didn't kill him! You killed him! No! Your fingerprints are on the scalpel! That can't be! Why did you go to the kitchen? To burn some letters. Why did you burn the gloves? No... Answer! I don't know what you're saying. I burnt...I burnt the letters! What about your blackjack? I don't know... So you have a blackjack, then! No, no! You killed the professor to rob him! I...I... Speak! You are S. Lopez! No! No! You are S. Lopez! You are S. Lopez! You are S. Lopez! Yes... I am... S. Lopez. Sir, a telephone call. Hello! Lima, yes. She died about a half hour ago. Sir... Here's the wallet Torres found around the corner. Empty, of course. The woman has marks of rings on two fingers. Surely the murderer took them off. S. Lopez! When will we see the end of this cynical exhibitionist? S. Lopez is abnormal, sir. And he couldn't resist the temptation to challenge us. No, Morales! S. Lopez must have a vital motive. An extreme need, to take such risks. What is that need? If only we could answer this question... Wait! Look! See that little pool next to the right foot? Yes, sir. Do you think that... It's clear, Morales! Torres! Take photos of those tracks. Fast! Yes, sir. Let's go, Morales. It seems the real S. Lopez still lives in Babel House. Knock on the door! Where are you coming from, doctor? Good evening, Mr. Lima. You were saying? What were you doing around 6:30? I was walking. With this weather? Why not? I love the rain. Under it we find everything. Fallen women, ghosts and madmen. Adventure, love... And death! Well said. Good evening, Mr. Lima! Are all your tenants present, Mrs. Duval? Yes, sir. Except Mr. Norton, that is, who left early for his club and hasn't returned. Very well, tell the others to go to their rooms and wait for my orders. Yes, sir. Go in. Go ahead, doctor. Do you limp? Like Epictetus, the stoic philosopher. Have you only now noticed? What time did you leave to buy that girdle? At around 5. I ask you once again to shut your mouth, Ma'am! And why did you only return now, at 7? I went to the movies, sir. Aha! My wife doesn't like it, so I went alone. Which cinema? What movie? A risque movie, surely! They're the only ones he likes. Please, Ma'am! Which cinema? The Rosedal, the one on Plaza Italia. I regret it for you, Mr. Vargas. Why? At about 6:30, on Las Heras Street, next to the fence of the Botanical Garden, S. Lopez killed a woman. I was leaving the home of a promoter who asked me there because he has a bad flu. And you went to give him fumigations? No, sir. I went to get a contract. In a few days I debut in his casino. Where does your promoter live? In a mansion on the corner of Alvear and Acevedo. Close to the botanical garden? Exactly! From 5 to 7 I was with a lady. She was stupendous. She had a fragrance of wild violets. In the home of a lady who walks... in the Botanical Garden and serves tea in a samovar? No, chief. In the home of a young lady who lives in Palermo and prefers whisky over tea with milk. But whose identity you insist on hiding? Ah, yes. A Russian never implicates a woman. Not even when obligated by the law, chief. Good evening, Mr. Lima. Good evening. Where are you coming from? From the Gimnasia y Esgrima club. In Palermo? Yes. I had a bridge game. What time did you leave the club? Ah... Around 6:15. I remember because 10 minutes earlier the game ended. Do you know that S. Lopez just committed his ninth murder? No. It doesn't seem to surprise you much. I always suspected Lamas was victim of a trap set by the real S. Lopez. Tell me, haven't you suspected that Miranda's accusation might implicate someone else, not only the watchmaker? Yes. Who do you suspect? Yes. I've suspected him since the beginning. Dr. Robledo, all the evidence points to you! The tracks in the mud are identical to yours. You must explain where you were yesterday at 6:30! Your silence will get you nowhere, sooner or later you'll have to explain! What are you hoping for? I'm not hoping for anything...I'm waiting. What are you waiting for? I'm waiting for S. Lopez to deign to commit his tenth crime. Welcome! Excuse me, friends, but... this is the first time in my life I've felt...so happy. I... Don't get emotional, dear friend. After all, we owe you this. Lamas, the one who won't forgive you is Lila. Miss Lila? Why? You made her miss her audition. Norton! The central character alone with S. Lopez was a watchmaker. She's suddenly had to change him into a doctor. Truly, my dear Norton, you were correct in doubting Lamas' guilt. Do you now believe in that of Dr. Robledo? Without any doubt. I always suspected that insufferable misanthropist. Not me. Would a bet interest you? I'll bet you 100 pesos against 50. Accepted. Please, gentlemen, why speak of such a painful subject? Spasiba, my dear lady. Mrs. Duval is right. We should prepare for the theater. It wouldn't be right to arrive late for Mr. Merlin's debut. Well...we, Miss Lila, you'll have to excuse us... We're all going! It's that, since my husband gets paid at the end of the month, Mr. Rivas, we... But it's on me, Ma'am, of course. I appears our young journalist has an inheritance. Even better, Mr. Andreyev, today I got my first check as Editor in Chief. Tell your men not to lose sight of any of the tenants after the show...especially the magician. And now, my distinguished audience, the sensation of the present, past and future, displays of telekinesis, clairvoyance, and oneiromancy! There is no impossible answer for Merlin! Ask away, audience! What is my name? Juana Rodriguez! Who will win the football championship this year? River Plate! Who is... S. Lopez? S. Lopez... is me. That was spectacular, Mr. Merlin! Marvelous! Fan...fan...fan... Fantastic! So much so that he could be a magnificent S. Lopez! I'm going make a painting of you, Merlin! It gave me goosebumps! That crematorium trick is increible! Miss Lila, I owe you part of my triumph. Your posters were a hit. Miss Lila, I owe you part of my triumph. Your posters were a hit. [The text of this poster was disappeared by the famous Merlin.] A brilliant idea! Superb! [The text of this poster was disappeared by the famous Merlin.] My girlfriend and I are like that, gentlemen. You won't stay a while, Lucho? It's raining hard. And it will keep raining. The only radiant sky is that of your smile. Ay, dear! Another kiss like that and I'll never be able to think up another slogan. I'll help you. If you want a nice life, make Lila your wife. Hi, Rivas. They closed the cafe and I had to wait outside. Luckily it stopped raining. Please excuse my tardiness, Andreyev. I understand. It's not easy to forsake the presence of an enchanting girl. How did you give the detective the slip? To hell with him. For a few blocks we played cops and robbers. Finally... he threw himself against the wall. Where are we going? Wherever you go. And if I were to throw myself in the river? I'd lend you a hand. Very well, S. Lopez, I appreciate your frankness. What's gotten into you, Rivas? I've decided to question all the tenants like this. That way I'll be sure to name the guilty party. A very stupid diversion. Stupid and dangerous. Let's suppose I were S. Lopez... That would mean my idea is not so absurd. No, Rivas. It would mean you're opening yourself to be dispatched to a better world. Don't believe it. The right pocket of my jacket contains a pistol. And my finger is on the trigger. So... you also don't think Robledo is the criminal? No. The doctor was arrested due to that flimsy story of the tracks. S. Lopez is not a man to commit that kind of error. You're not starting to regret this encounter, Rivas? The street is deserted... The fog covers us in its impalpable powder. I regret nothing. This conversation fascinates me. But your suspicions regarding me deepen by the second. No? I suspect you...and Merlin. Bad move. Which? To suspect the Hindu. Why? Because he's innocent. You're impossible to scare! This is your house, no? I'll take my leave. Tell your chief I'll write the piece he wants for a thousand pesos. That's what I wanted to tell you. Please excuse the joke. Are you angry? No. Good. See you tomorrow then, and bring me an answer. Dr. Robledo Freed Double Crime By S Lopez Leaving the casino, the painter continued to Esmeralda Street and took the number 10 tram. I didn't lose sight of him for even a second. He entered Babel and didn't leave for the rest of the night. And Vargas? He and his wife turned on Corrientes when it began to rain like a deluge. Passing by the Opera, they mixed in with the people coming out of the cinema and... And then? They disappeared? As if the rain had swallowed them. And you, Torres? The Hindu came out an hour later. He ran after a taxi and stopped it and... He made himself disappear! No, sir. I could have followed him, but no other taxi came by. Very well! How is Rivas? Out of danger, sir. Unfortunately he couldn't give us any clues, aside from confirming the innocence of Andreyev. So our great theory goes out the window! The watchmaker, the cripple, the Russian, all cleared! Another red herring so he can have a laugh at our expense! But he's hemming himself into a smaller and smaller circle. There are only three suspects left. Two! If Pena is not lying, Norton is no longer a suspect. And if we arrest Vargas and Merlin, sir? What would we gain? We don't only want to stop the killer, we need to unmask him. Have you read the papers? If this keeps up we won't be able to resist the public's anger. Yes, Morales. What? Yes. Perfectly. Wait for further orders. Leiva found S. Lopez' weapon in the basement of an abandoned building on Guemes Street, suspended from one of the bars of the skylight. They haven't removed it, no? No, sir. The bag is still in its place. The trap is ready to spring. Sir! No, let him go! At 9 I'll call Leiva. Hang tight. Maybe this rain means it's S. Lopez' funeral. Did you go to the hospital today, Miss Espinosa? See Mr. Merlin, Lucho says hi to everyone. He'll be discharged this week. I'm happy to hear that. Tomorrow I'll go see him before the show. Ah, yes, it's going to get late on us, Mr. Vargas! I'm off to my club, Mr. Merlin. Would you like to join me at a bridge table? Go out on my day of rest? Never. I appreciate it, Norton, but when in bed I come up with the most incredible tricks. It's still raining... On S. Lopez' watch... it's the hour of crime. Vargas, since your wife's not here, let's play some poker. Wonderul idea! Will you join us, doctor? Might as well. Do...do...do you plan to bet high? Oh no, Vargas. An innocent poker, like a spring morning, running naked through the grass. Would you like to play, Lila? No thanks, Andreyev. I'd prefer to watch, if it doesn't make you uncomfortable. Oh no, my child. And you, Lamas, shut off that blessed record. Three! Three aces! Queens full. A...another card. This is my last 100 pesos. You're not very lucky tonight. Terrible. Me...my wife... Do you feel sick, Vargas? No. I'll open with five. Ah... You open. Forty. I'm in. See. I'm out. See. How many cards, Vargas? I...I...I stand. And you, Andreyev? None. One. Straight. I win! Jacks full! One moment, my dear man. Kings full. What's wrong, Miss Lila? No. Nothing. Nothing. I beg you to... to forgive me. Strange... she looked terrified. As if she had seen S. Lopez in person. Ex...excuse me. Excuse me, I need to go to the theater to get my wife. Please, don't let her find out I lost so much. Mr. Merlin! What's wrong, Miss Espinosa? S. Lopez! What? I know who it is! You must help me! They'll kill me! What are you saying, child? Explain! But what a fantasy! It's ridiculous! I swear, you must believe me! Listen, your boyfriend's accident has frazzled your nerves. Go and rest. Believe me, Mr. Merlin! Take a sedative and lie down. Don't make me use my powers! Go, lie down. I'll tell Dr. Robledo to prepare you a sedative. No!!! Then forget about it and go rest. Where are you going, dear? When I saw the tricks they used to beat Vargas, I suddenly understood the truth. It was so unbelievable that I couldn't hide my fear. Those three collaborated in poker and in crime. I didn't doubt for an instant what you told me, Lila, but I suspected they were listening and would kill both of us at the first sign of our defense. I faked disbelief, then went to Robledo with the pretext of the sedative. I knocked him out, tied him up, and put on his S. Lopez disguise. You've done us an immense service, Miss Espinosa. Now it all seems so simple. In the famous card lay the brilliant idea. With it, Lamas, Andreyev and Robledo closed our eyes, making us think we were dealing with a lone murderer. When they knew their lair had been discovered, they killed Professor Miranda. They tried to outplay the police with that diabolic act of killing, making themselves suspects, and obtaining, finally, a certificate of innocence for each one. God knows who they planned to frame for the crimes. You were right, Morales. This rain turned out to be S. Lopez' funeral. Well, boys, I think we deserve a little distraction. Let's go see that movie! Death Walks in the Rain
