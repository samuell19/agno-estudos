There's nothing like the physical strength of a woman scorned... Not physical, but the mental strength. That mental strength can weather the pain of childbirth. It can lift a gargantuan mountain and throw it to the ground. I didn't see anything. I can't imagine an elephant moving that lamp post... ...let alone lifting it with my bare hands. If the monk hadn't interfered, that man would be dead. I didn't hear anything... Amazing... The places they choose to work out their problems. What you need to work out problems is not a suitable place, only an opportunity. I didn't understand what the problem was. You're still too young to understand it. How much older do I have to be? After you're married and become a mother. Why are you laughing? No reason. No reason? It's not a joke. Sometimes, everything feels like a joke. What is that? Sarcasm? It's nothing like that. Why? No reason... Why laugh for no reason? If you can cry for no reason, why can't you laugh for no reason? Madam, why are you crying? Just felt sad... Is that a reason to cry? Let her cry. Hi. Hi. You seem really tired. Your shirt is all wrinkled too. Did our son call? He's going to San Francisco with his friends. That girl called again. She said you came there. Why did you call the house? To make sure that you got home safe. You could've just called my mobile. It wasn't working. No, don't. I have enough money. Then what do you want? To talk a little. Come. Come in. Sit down. Please. Yes. It is insanity. But what am I supposed to do if I can't control myself? Yes! I fully understand the gravity of the situation. But none of that matters to me. I want you! That's all. Hi. Hi. Was the beach crowded? She told me that the two of you went to the beach. What is the meaning of this nonsense? What, me? I don't know how to handle this girl. She's a smart kid. All of us have multiple identities. There began a period... ...where people started looking around for identities. "Who am I? What is my place in this society?" Identity politics, in many ways, comes from insecurities... ...that we have to find an anchoring in other people who are like us. She didn't come for lectures today, professor... Madam... Sir, he just has to see me. His mind searches for me. When I don't go to Campus, he comes here looking for me. He waits for me to come out of my room impatiently... He can never wait too long. He has very little patience. I am not confessing this to mess with you. Only to ease my own mind. He knows every nook and cranny of my body. When he combs through it... ...I don't understand what he is searching for. I don't want to understand. He is looking for something he thinks I have, that you don't. I would like to remain the object of his desire. For that, I am willing to sacrifice my life. He is taking a journey across my life. I am enjoying it. Madam, you think he is doing something wrong. But I don't think he is. Why do I think that? Searching for lost desire, in someone else's life. What can be wrong with that? Madam. If you won't get upset, may I confess something to you? I would like to carry your husband's child. Madam? Madam? Madam! Hi. Hi. Why? I am having a headache. Must be the climate Just sleep and you'll be all right. What's this? Why? You never come in here You never lock the door. But you never open the door when I am inside. I needed to spit. May be you're coming down with a fever. No. There's a sour taste in my mouth... Oh! Go and sleep. Why are you trying to put me to sleep? Where were you headed? Campus. What lectures did you have today? I don't have any lectures today. Then? I don't care about lectures. What kind of crazy game are you playing? That's something even I don't understand. I helped you because I thought you were talented... ...at studies. I didn't expect anything in return. I know that. Shall I make you some tea? I don't want your tea. Just answer my question without driving me crazy. I won't be making any exceptions for you from now on. I don't need any help. You've helped me more than enough. Then what do you want? Two spoons of sugar enough for you? No sugar. This is a dangerous game. You should stop this. I have a family. You should have a future. How come? Just like that. Isn't our daughter home? She won't be home till evening. She's having practices. Have you eaten? No. Hold on, Let me fix something quickly. No, I'll eat whatever is there. Let me just have a shower first. Hello! Madam, can we talk? Yes, we can talk. Madam, I am afraid. Of whom? Of myself. I know that sir started helping me because I am good at studies. He had good intentions, but what am I to do? I developed feelings for him. A suicidal type of love. That's why I am afraid. That something might happen to you because of me. Don't worry about me. Why don't you find a more suitable relationship... ...without trying to destroy your life for no good reason. I know what I am doing is wrong. But you can't think and reason when it comes to love. I know he doesn't love me. But why does he come to see me here? Tell him not to come again. I think he likes my body. Madam! Hello! - Go on, go on. - Hello. Madam. I don't go to campus because I can't control myself. I avoid him. But he can't do the same. He comes here looking for me. He came today as well. He came today? Yes. He's still here. Still there? Bitch! That's true. This is simply because people-- There are more cars than people, in Kalamburam. So, how long did marketing take you today? You won't believe! One and a half hours. - You drove there or... - Yeah. I did. Amazing! I just can't believe this. Not because-- Excuse me. Come on. Don't be a child. Come in. Where are you going in such a hurry? I told the girl she can stay here and go to campus with you. Going to her place to help her looks bad. You attend dad's lectures? Prepare your brother's room for our visitor. I don't have lectures today. Then why the hell don't you get out and go wherever you want to go. I meant if you don't have lectures either... ...then we can go somewhere and talk. What would I want to talk to you about? Sir, is there a problem? Sorry, I felt like the engine was lagging. In a new vehicle like this? Drive safely... Shall I order another drink? What's this? What do you mean? You never come in here. Just felt like it. Stop messing around and leave. Tired? There were a lot of lectures. Our son called. What did he say? Says he's learning to surf in the San Francisco bay. Honestly, the boy is crazy. Good! It's his vacation. Nice to have new experiences. If something happens to him? What's going to happen? They are just boys. Boy? He's old enough to get married now! There's no set age for marriage. Oh sorry, the door was open. It's all right, Madam. I thought you must be studying. Had no lectures today. The two of us went to a beach restaurant. Yes, he told me. Even though you're skinny now, you'll end up like a sack of potatoes. Is your father a big man? I wouldn't know. Never met him. Oh, Sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Oh, no. Things like that don't bother me. Is he dead? I don't know. I think he's around somewhere. So you're a product of your mother sleeping around in the bushes? Not in bushes. On comfortable mattresses. Can't you tell? A body like mine could not have been conceived in the bushes. Stupid whore! Come to eat. I thought you were asleep. What's wrong? Nothing. Look... If you have something to say, don't keep it inside. Just say it. Don't take me for a fool. Why should I take you for a fool? If you want to sleep with that girl, go! The door is open. Nonsense. Don't make a fool of yourself in public places. It's not good for your reputation! Whatever you're thinking is not on my mind. What are you doing here? The professor threw me out and took off. Why is that? No idea. Looks like you know your way around a kitchen! I helped cook for hundreds during the 'Alms Giving' at the village temple. Is there a large temple in your village? Yes. A royal temple. I am going for a sermon today. Do you want to come? Why? When I go to sermons, I get kicked out by the women. Why is that? Afraid the monk might mess up his sermon if I sit at the front! For sure! What happened now? Let's put some ice on it. Hi. Where's your mother? She went to the temple. I asked to join, but she said no. 'She' went too! Madam, that sermon today was some love story! Have you been to Sanchi? - In India? - Yeah. Not at all. After our son was born, we didn't have another child for over 10 years. So we went to India, to Sanchi Stupa praying for a baby girl. The Sanchi Stupa is located in Vidisha. The hometown of King Ashoka's first and most beloved wife, Asandimitra. She gave birth to... ...the King's two children Mahendra and Sanghamitra. She was a Buddhist! Another consort of the king was Karuvaki. She was a Hindu. She didn't bear children. Some claim that the King Ashoka loved Asandimitra the most. Others claim he loved Karuvaki the most. Well, the King is not alive today to confirm anything! So the monk's sermon was the 506th Jataka Story. It is a similar story to King Ashoka's alleged love triangle. It's the story of Lord Buddha, who was born... ...as a King Tusker in one life, and loved two elephant queens. A version of this story is illustrated in stone at the Sanchi Stupa. My favorite incident in the story is where the King Tusker topples the Sal tree. The monk described it beautifully like a scene from a movie. Have you finished? I've had enough. Ridiculous! Why? She wants to go in the bus. Why is that? Who knows! Let's go! I won't come if you're going to throw me out halfway! What's with the long face? Your mother was the one who said you can't come. But you could have persuaded her. How am I supposed to do that? You could have if you wanted to! All right, next time I will say something. Don't bother. Don't get mad at me. We weren't friends in the first place. No need to sit next to people who aren't your friends! Hey! Stop that! Why? Is it hurting you? You deserve so much merit for saving my daughter's life. Bring her back. No need. Bring her back. It feels like there's a great absence! Ridiculous. Why did you leave? I won't leave that easily. I meant why did you leave the house? Living there distracts me from my goal. What is your goal? Let's go someplace, where no one can see us or hear us? Here? Yes. Don't take me for a joke. You're not a joke to me. A dangerous dream. Let's go. Do you want to go to the temple? I can't. Then why did you almost kill yourself? Couldn't you find her? I didn't look for her. Wasn't she at the university today? I don't know. I didn't look for her. The few days she was in this house, things seemed whole for some reason. In vain. What's with you? What the hell! Then why did you invite me? You said you're not coming. Your father will be alone! Is he a baby? Jasmine! Your favorite scent. Why did you go... ...leaving behind only your scent? You kept pushing me away. Me too. But what was I supposed to do? When they see me, even animals go insane. That's what my village folks used to say. When I walked back home in the evening after bathing, women would not only hide their husbands, they'd lock their dogs in the house too. So saying you don't want me, is a lie. But when there are so many young boys on campus... ...why me? I can find hundreds of men who want me. But I don't want to go to bed with a man who just likes my body. I want to win the love of someone that I feel love for. Men went crazy over me. But you, sir, made me go crazy. Is that right? The absolute truth! I... ...want to look at you. I exist only for you to look at. But I am worried that others might see me looking at you. I am afraid of that. I will secretly show myself to you. Did she come back? Who? Did she really come? Who? No one came here. I can still smell her all over the house. That bitch came here today didn't she? Didn't she? That flowery scent is still all over your body. Tell me the truth. She came here didn't she? Yes. When? A little while ago. What do you want? I've left my perfume bottle here. It's probably in the room, may I check? Hmm. This bottle was full. No one here would use someone else's perfume. Professor gave me this for excelling in my second year. That's not a very good perfume. Do you want a better one? I don't use perfume. I only used it because the professor gave it to me. That too only when I went to see him. I shouldn't have come here when you invited me. Everything got messed up because of it. What got messed up? Your grand plan to ruin our family? I had such a strong conviction about my love, about winning that love. The strength to even kill myself for it. But that strength melted away after I came here. I saw you yesterday at the temple! So he told you that too? Told me what? That we went to the temple. Who told me? Who else? I am going, Madam. Listen... ...can we stop this game at least now? Please! Have you had breakfast? Eat some milk-rice before you go. Hi. Hi. I am going to the temple. What's with you? I am going to the temple. Don't you have homework? Exams are around the corner, isn't it? I'll study after I come back. No need to go today. Why is there no need? I want to come! Young girls don't need to go to the temple everyday. No need to come. I will go alone! So what's wrong if the girl goes to the temple? What's with young girls and their craze over temples? She doesn't need to go today. You little whore! You sleep with my husband and then come here to reach enlightenment? What the fuck! If your man runs behind other women, go and deal with him without trying to murder me! I came here to see for myself! What the hell is there to see, bitch? Get the fuck off! Let go of me! Let you go? Yes that is exactly what I plan to do! Let go of me! Let you go? That's exactly what I am going to do! Get the fuck off! Stop this shameless thing! I am shameless? Just because I am stuck in the house all day, you think I don't know what goes on? You bastard! It must hurt to see your secret whore in pain! Yes, the two of you! Get together, kill and devour me! Isn't that what you want? Everyone, get out of here without polluting these sacred grounds! Yes, your Greatness, I will leave... I'll leave only after I've ended this once and for all! Bitch! I will finish you, stupid bitch! Let's go! Go where? Let's just get out of here! There's nothing like the physical strength of a woman scorned. Not physical, the mental strength. That strength can weather the pain of child birth. It can lift a gargantuan mountain and throw it to the ground. I didn't see anything. I can't imagine an elephant moving that lamp post... ...let alone lifting it with my bare hands. I didn't hear anything. Amazing. The places they choose to work out their problems.
