(dramatic music) (beep) (suspenseful music) (projector crackling) (upbeat music) (volcano exploding) (air whooshing) (glass shuttering) (bright music) (metal clanking) (water bubbling) (unsettling chord) - I made it. I got it. Wolf. (Lamb screaming) Wolf. Wolf. Wolf. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - Come on you fuck, come on. No, no, no, God. Hi, baby. - Where were you? - What do you mean? - When I came out of the water you weren't there, I thought you were gonna wait for me? - Well, I mean it's your adventure (chuckles) it's not mine. Any way I had to, fuck it it's raining I don't wanna get wet where the fuck did you thin I'm am. Anyway what do you got, you got something for me? You got, so lets see, okay come on. Lets do it. Get dry, lets see what you got. - Oh my God. Tt's pretty. - That is so lame. - That is so awesome, I can add it to my collection. - Oh yeah, look at that. - I don't care what you say. This is like fate or divine presence or something. - Listen, don't become a Jesus freak just because there's a pig in the box and you collect pigs. It's no big deal. Like it's just a coincidence. It's nothing more than that. - You're such a skeptic skeptic. - I'm not skeptic, I'm someone that others would call a realist. - Or (indistinct) an actual pig. - Hold on, hold on. All right. Be prepared to be wowed. That's what its, (bells chiming) Are you fucking kidding me? What is that? What is that like a Ben wobble. What is that? That's it, that's fucking it. That's the only thing in here. That's bullshit. - Well, let me see. Let me see. It's pretty, (indistinct) pretty piggy, yeah. - All right. Well, the good news is it will make numero uno a lot easier. - What's that? - That's Spanish for number one. - Thanks, genius. What's the rule? Rule number one is you're supposed to leave something of equal or greater value. - Isn't that subjective? I mean, how do you know, how do we know this had any value to the person who left it? - Well, that's the, honestly, it's a little frustrated. I'm being completely serious. Why do I have to keep repeating myself? That's the whole point of this experience it's about emotional value, it's not about monetary value. It's about emotional value. I don't know, do you have something? (bird chirping) Nice. I thought you hated this. - I don't hate it. I love it. It's the first thing you ever gave me. It's just not something I would wear, but I keep it with me all the time. If that's not an emotional value then I don't know what is. - Okay. You're the boss. (Wolf groaning) Now listen, don't get too warm, you gotta go back in the water. Let's go. I don't wanna be here all day. (doll squealing) (unsettling music) (bricks rambling) (suspenseful music) (creature groaning) (muffled breathing) (machine beeping) (man laughing) (gun banging) - Stinking beast. (suspenseful music) (creature groaning) (gunshot blaring) (Roger groaning) (suspenseful chords) (gun banging) - Keep you stinking of off me. (Roger groaning) (creature groaning) (dramatic music) (machine beeping) (Bright music) - So they swear to God it's true. He opens the box and what's inside the box? A first edition Hemingway, old man and the sea signed by Hemingway. Now, how do you leave something of equal or greater value? - You can't. - You can't do it. I'm just saying that you can't, there's no way to find an equal or greater value. That's what I'm saying. - Jury Duty. - I don't know why you fill out the form? - Legally required. - Bullshit listen to me, if you fill out the form they know where you live, if they know where you live, they could put you on Jury Duty. You just don't fill out the form. - It's civic duty. (Garret sighs) Well, what did you guys get? - You wanna see what got? - Yeah. - You'll never believe it. Look (indistinct) that. - You got a ball. - Yeah, fucking ball. A ball that I could have gotten out of a box of cereal. That's what I found. Okay, do you want it, I don't want it, you can have it. This has some kind of sentimental value. This is the hand of an Oscar winner. That's what this is. That's why it's amazing. - (indistinct) - It's a jingle ball. - Whatever happened to sentimental value. - Oh wait, whose is this? Is this mine? Oh, this is his? Turtle. Turtle. Turtle. Jesus Christ. Anyway, sentimental. You wanna know about sentimental? It's a very good theory. And then I read about this guy who found this first edition Hemingway. So all bets are off. Oh, my good try this. - No, I'm good thank you. - No, take a bite of it. - I become a vegan. - Vegan. - Even the next one will be aligned with your materialistic sensibility. Speaking of which, when's the next expedition thingies? - It's not called an expedition, it's called a challenge in the first place, in the second place, I was thinking that maybe the next one, I'd like to go alone, all right? - Why, I thought we had fun together? - What are you saying? I thought we had fun together. - Baby here's the thing. This is, you know, it's my time. It's like my me time. - I'm always with you. - Why can't we do your me time together? - How about this? How about we go off and on like one time you come with me, one time I go alone or with my brother Turtle. Maybe I can do that. I don't always have to be together. You know, you could go shopping- - Yeah, okay, but that Arnold Ralston guy went off by himself and look what happened to him. He got stuck under a Boulder for 127 days. - Do you mean Aaron Ralston? Aaron Ralston wrote a bestselling book and they made a big movie about it. And James Franco played him. I'd like to Franco to play me. Wouldn't you like to see James Franco play me? - He got nominated for an Oscar. - He got nominated for an Oscar. I could have an Oscar. - Yeah, and then he cut his own arm off. - That's, leaving behind something of equal or greater value. Do you see how it all comes back in circle? - Oh, Griffin's here. I'll go get him. - [Turtle] I think he'll crank a loss a lot. - Hey Griffin. - Hey, Mrs. Scarlett Lamb (indistinct) gift. - Thank you. - Remember Sable Ladel? - Wolf's skin turtleneck. - Mr. Griffin. - No, no stay seated. You're gonna want to stay seated for this. - I wasn't standing up. - Hey, you want something to drink? I got a nice smooth Merlot or something called Total Domination. - Whatever you're having is cool with me. - Baby Total Domination, please. - Yeah - No, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, actually. My heart's racing like a Jack rabbit. - What's going on, what's the big deal here? - Let me ask you a question. Are you ready for the queen motherload of all geocache challenges? I'm talking about the challenge, It's the challenge of a lifetime. Are you ready for your minds to go (air blowing) - Oh, I don't want that. You want that, Turtle, you want it. - Okay. (desk slamming) - What is the number one rule in life guys? - Wait a minute, life has rules, I wish somebody would've told me. - Of course it has rules. If you want something, you go after it. Am I right? - Right. - I feel like I'm right, I know I'm right? - You're right, you're right. - (indistinct) baby, get to the funny point bout the foster challenge. - Ah, he knows about the foster challenge. - I know about- - What's the foster challenge? - It's a legendary geocache challenge. - It's a myth. - Where Roger Foster plan- - It never happened. - It happened. - It happened. - Doesn't exist. - Wait a second, we're talking about the entrepreneur. - The guy is an inventor, an aviator, everything he touched turned to gold. - Yes, so in other words, an entrepreneur. - All right, Alex Trebeck, he's an entrepreneur. Wait a minute. Did you know that he wasn't geocacher? - Yeah, I think I got that part too. - All right you got that part. did you know that his mother died a week after he disappeared? Did you know that smarty pants. - Guys this has zero to do with his dead mother, all right? What's important here is that he was out in the desert geocaching when he vanished. - Or so some people say. - Guys, the whole thing makes sense, listen, this is this right here. (suspenseful chords) Boom. - What's that? - It's a longitude and a latitude and that looks like some sort of frequency. - A frequency to what? - To a blip, - A beacon that was sent out for almost three whole minutes yesterday, yesterday. Smack dead in the middle of all that governmental land. There I call it forbidden zone. - [Garret] Holly shit. - Holly shit is right - Wow, wow you're not thinking of going out there. Didn't you just say that places is all toxic? - [Griffin] I mean, radiation it dissipates, it goes away at some point. - And you know that how? - Turtle, (indistinct). - Oh, it was an explosion. Generally, when there's a leakage, it's more dangerous because it soaks into the earth and it basically got a shelf life of 2 billion years, but when there's an explosion, the heat from the blast only burns it up immediately. Relatively speaking, I mean, there's still radiation, but it's generally no more than we get every single day. So no sunblock, long sleeps. - Couldn't have said it better myself, that was amazing. Guys, we're not building somewhere else, you guys you're going to be in and out bada bing bada boom (indistinct). - Okay then. Wait, does that mean we're going on another geocache challenge? (Lamb screaming) - Oh, shit, yes. That's great. - Wait do that mean? - Yes, yes, That's what it means. - [Griffin] (indistinct) this one yet. - Okay, so where do we go, where do we go? - Put that down you are not old enough to drink. (upbeat music) (Griffin laughing) - In a post in June '06 Roger Foster mentioned that this entire area, he said, that it would be amazing for tressure hunters. - I'm so fucking excited. I can't even tell you. Sable don't look up (indistinct) (Garret laughing) Rodger fucking Foster. - [Voice Over radio] Senator (indistinct) comment, one moment you're there and then splat wiped away just like that. - Let me ask you something. - (Voice over radio) The president referred to this- - Why do you put up with him? - What do you mean? - You're young and attractive. You could have any guy that you want, and yet you stay with this guy, well too old for you frankly. - [Voice over radio] with this in mind, one can only wonder- - Who know what he buried to here? Like that time he did it (indistinct) sound like that. - Somebody buried that stupid thing? - [Garret] Yeah. - [Voice Over radio] I don't believe it and neither should you, frankly- - He doesn't even treat you that well. I mean, he's not a bad guy. He's my brother and I love him, but he is kind of a controlling narcissistic as whole, isn't he? (air whooshing) (upbeat music) - That's the thing, man. This is Roger Foster we're talking about here. This is the Foster Challenge. Dude, I mean, this could be anything. It could be a suitcase full of money. It could be keys to a house, a blimp. - Or it could be a Kewpie doll. - Its easier to be cynical about these kinds of things, but you all know number two rule in life, what's the best way to find something? - You look. - You look. - Look. - [Garret] Oh, shit. (car engine roaring) (upbeat music) - This is it. The last place the blip is transmitted. - Can you pin point the spot exactly? - Yeah, up in there. (horn blaring) - Up in here is a pretty big are. - I don't believe this. - Wolf, can I talk you right now? - You know what? Baby now's not a good time. We're kind of in the middle of something. Let's go, come on. - Garret Reed, if you care about me at all, you will stop what you're doing and talk to me. - Okay. Lamb, do you remember what doctor Orrick said? Do you remember what he said about you coming at me all aggressive and then I flood and then nothing really happens. Now, this challenge has me all hyped up emotionally and then, you know, kind of mixed in with that at this moment, I'm having a little bit of frustration and to be perfectly honest, a little guilt. - Oh really? What do you feel guilty about. - Honey, can we just table this discussion for the moment and then maybe we can have it later. - When? - What? - When are we gonna talk about it? - I don't honey, later, please. - Well, Dr. Orrick also said, if you can't talk about something in the moment that it would be helpful to plan and commit to a time later on that way I will be able to manage my expectations. - Okay, how about three o'clock? - Today? - Yeah. - PM. - Lamb, there's only one more three o'clock in this day. So yes, it would be PM. - You'll commit to that no matter what. - Yes, no matter what I'm doing, doesn't matter whether I'm opening some great treasure that Roger Foster left for us or taking a big smelly shit. I'll stop exactly at three o'clock and you and I will have this discussion. - Okay. Putting it on my phone. - Okay, you do that. All right I'm coming. Wait for me. (suspenseful music) - Find anything? - Creepy doll and I assume this a graffiti. Sable looks like she's upset. Griffin, is camera. - What's up buddy? - I gotta go. (Griffin laughing) (bell chiming) - Please do something about your brother. - Turtle. - Aw, what the hell? - What are you doing? You're taking a piss in a room that we're all standing in. Go outside. You don't have to get abusive I'll go outside. - I don't believe I was being abusive. I believe I was being informative. Go outside. You need a thesaurus. You need manners. - [Griffin] You need a face. Love you turtle. (metal clanking) (zipper zips) - [Garret] (indistinct) smoke that all the time. No, I don't want it. - What? Come on. - [Garret] I mean come on, I don't know what you're doing, why are you smoking that now? - [Griffin] It's like ridding a dragon. - [Garret] You don't ride the dragon while we are on an adventure like this. I need you focused and I need you to clear headed. - Why does it have to be now? Any events (indistinct) time. - No, time's a good time. I think we need to stay sharp and we need to stay focused (indistinct). - He's trying to sneak a little box out there. It's kinda cool. - Thanks. - Why is it wet? - [Turtle] I was just (indistinct). (Griffin laughing) - Shut up. - Oh, my God. This guy. - All right, other than the hat for the battery, I don't know what to do. There's no way to open it. There's no way to open it. There's there's no USB port, there's no plug. All there is is a battery hat, I don't know even how it works. - What do we do now? Do we turn it over to the authorities? - You know what, this is bullshit. We find something guys. We find this thing. Right here, what is this? You know, the only way we find out what this is, is to hand it over to the fucking regime. The administration. Fuck no, cause those, those are the same jive turkeys that wanna keep our eyeballs off this in the first place. You know what I mean? - Fight the power. - Fuck, yeah, fight the power. That's what I'm talking about. I mean, we know we're not supposed to be here. You know, we know what we know, even though we don't know what that is. - This is what happens when you smoke marijuana. - But it doesn't even fucking matter, right? Because these guys, they can get ahold of our cell phones. They can get hold of our computers and they can just set the information right in front us. And then they're gonna know what we know. And then they're going to know that we know that they know it. This could be the biggest challenge of all time. And we can't a soul about. That my friend is bullshit. - [Sable] Bullshit. - But what is this? Do you know what it is, Turtle? - I have no idea what that is. - Did you see any instructions on this thing? I don't see any God damn instructions. (indistinct chattering) - I do not think this building is structurally sound. Hello. - Turtle check it out. Come on. - Wait, don't go in there. Have none of you ever seen a movie? - Are you fucking for real? In pretty much every movie, especially the scary ones, there's at least one moment where the audience is just sitting there knowing better, knowing something that the characters in the story don't know and it makes them wanna scream out, "No, stop, don't do that, don't open that door." What if this is one of those moments? I mean, just imagine some couples sitting on their sofa or some kid watching on his computer under the covers when he should be sleeping. - Okay, even I'm confused now. - I'm just saying this could be the moment. This could be the tipping point. - Lamb, I want you to listen to me very carefully because be the tipping point of our relationship because in every moment life gets ramped up. And what do you do with those moments is what makes you who you are? You do not say I will go gently into that good night. You say I will go into that good night and I'll do a kicking and screaming like hell. Now listen to me, the bar just raised a little higher in everybody's life right here. What do you want to do? Do you wanna go in that hole with the rest of us or you will go "No, not me, not me." "No, thanks I want to go home, "I'll stop at Starbucks and get an $8 latte on the way "and I'm gonna watch some fictional TV show "or fictional people have fictional adventures" or do you wanna live your life? Now, the only way that we're going to live our life is to go through that whole. Okay, it might be dangerous, might be amazing. Might be a fucking hole in the fucking wall. But the only way we're gonna know what's in there is to go inside. Now, what is the second rule of life? - You want to look for, the best way to look for- - Oh, wait a minute the other second rule? The third, let's say what's the third rule is life? - If you don't take a step you'll always be in the same place. - You want to always be in the same place, Lamb? (melancholic music) What do you wanna do? Do you want to get on the other side of this hole and see what life has to offer and see who you over there or you wanna stay here because I'm going through that hole. They're going through that hole and I would love for you to come with me and if you want to stay here, I understand, but you have to understand this, the man you married is a man who loves life. And the only way to love life is to live life. Now you wanna live it or you want to go home. - Okay, let's take a look. (all applauding) - Yes. - [Garret] All right, honey, what's it look like down there. - I can't really see anything. - [Garret] Hold on I'm coming, I'm coming. - [Griffin] Okay, Wolf. - Yeah, it's dark buddy. - Okay. - Everybody be careful. - [Garret] Are you all Right? - Good. - This is, - Bad ass. - Let me see and it's getting a little tight. Alrighty. - Dirt all over the floor. - [Garret] Turtle, did you bring the box? The black box? (bats chirping) - [Turtle] Got it. - (indistinct) I hate caged crickets guys. (indistinct) Nasty creatures - Smells like a sewer. - Smells like death to me. - Guys this reminds me of a goldmine that my dad took me to When I was really little. It was a bad day guys. - [Garret] How convenient gold mine with a bad experience. - Guys (indistinct) giant mutant spider that just wants to cocoon us and then suck all the bodily fluids out of us living us, dry and (indistinct). - I'd like you to suck me dry so that I'm a husk, baby? - (indistinct) you know what I mean. - Guys, wait up. - Garrett, Wolf can you slow down, please? - Hey everybody be careful. I think I smelled something very cool. (ominous music) - Fuck, God damn it, what? - Guys we stop moving. - No, no, no. Oh no, we can't be. I can't go back. We must've missed a turn off the manhole cover or something. - What the fuck is the matter with you? What manhole cover? - I don't know. - There's no manhole cover. Wall, wall behind you guess what? Surprise another fucking wall. - That's three walls. - Okay. I haven't explained anything like this to you guys before, tight spaces really freak me out. And you guys keep saying- - It's uncomfortable. - You guys feel uncomfortable or is it just me? It's really tight back here. - It's not helping. - Wait, - Turtle. Turn off all your lights. - That's a terrible idea. - Turn them off. - All right. - Now let your eyes adjust. (suspenseful music) (rocks shattering) (heavy breathing) - (laughs) Oh, God, God. - [Lamb] Griffin. - Yeah, yeah. - Are you gonna go ahead? - Sorry. - [Garret] Sable you are next. - [Turtle] Why does she get to go? - [Garret] (indistinct) you get to look at her ass. Come on Sable you are next. - Come on. - [Garret] Would you just be patient for one in your life? Let me show you how it's done. - Amazing. - All right don't anybody help me, I'm coming up on my own. (laughs) - Not good, guys. Hello - What'd I tell you guys, - Guys. - You gotta live in adventure. - Guys I am up. I'm back. Yeah, how this? - Turtle - That was easy. - Turtle be careful. Come here wanna show you something. (indistinct) beautiful. You know what we need right now, Walmart? And I'm gonna buy this land and I'm going to build a Walmart right there. - No, you're not. - I was joking (suspenseful chords) - Hey guys, I think someone's here waiting for us. Some stuff over here. (ravel crunching) (ominous music) - Aw, God damn it. - Holly shit. What the hell is this? - Oh, wow. - Okay, I vote we leave immediately. - Maybe this is the whole point of why we came. This is a clue of some sort, right Griffin? - Absolutely. - What does it mean? - Your guess is as good as mine, man. - It's like an alter, like an offering or something. - Yeah, it can be. - All right, see honey, that's the point point. See she knows, you leave a little something. There you go, you got it? There you go. - [Sable] Needs a hat. - [Garret] Needs a hat yeah, just like Frosty. - [Woman] Hey, Lamb bring your shit over here. - [Griffin] Come on (indistinct) with this. (ominous music) - [Garret] Turtle, look away. - Sable you're so shy. - [Garret] Oh, I love it. - So shy. - How about here, put it around here. There you go.(laughs) - [Griffin] How about like this, there you go. Uh, see. - I like it. - How about that? There you go. See she's got it down. She knows what's going on. - All right. Now where do we go? - Maybe we look for a couple more of these see if leads us anywhere. It's a start. (gunshot blaring) - What was that? - [Garret] That was a in shot. Turtle. - Go. - [Garret] Gunshot, get down. (heavy breathing) Everybody stay down. Stay down. Lamb, Lamb are you all right? (creature growling) - What the fuck is going on. - Scarlett. - Wolf. - Lamb are you al right? Okay, stay where you are you hear me? Stay exactly where you are and get your body blow to the ground as you can. Griffin save 'em. - Griff. - Yes. - Turtle. Turtle. - [Griffin] Turtle. (creature growling) - What the fuck are you doing, get in there, get in there. Are you all right. - Your eye. - Don't worry about my eye. (gun blasting) Where is Turtle? Where's my brother? - I don't- - What do you mean you don't know? - (indistinct) I don't know. - All right do you know where the hole is? - Wolf. - You gotta go back the way we came in. You hear me? They way we came in. (gun banging) Shit. - [Sable] Griffin. - (indistinct) run. Turtle, brother. Turtle. - Wolf. Wolf. - Fuck you. (gun banging) (heavy breathing) - Seb. - Seb, we gotta run, go, go, go. (creature growling) (gun banging) (Sable crying) (phone alarm ringing) (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) (Lamb screaming) (ominous music) (geyser bubbling) (creature growling) (metal clanking) (Lamb screaming) (creature squealing) (man screaming) (creature squealing) (suspenseful music) - Oh, my God. Where's my (indistinct). (keys jiggling) - [Roger] It's a dead zone. - Wolf, Griffin is at you, hello? - [Roger] Your phone, do you no good in here. Not in this place. Really bad reception. - Who is that, hello. (door squeaking) - No, no, no. (suspenseful music) (water splashing) No, no, no, no. (creature squealing) (blood dripping) (body sizzling) - [Roger] It's not the end of the world. It's the beginning of a new one. Twisted, backward new world. There's an overlap. You see things they need to coexist for a while. (geyser bubbling) Here we are in this place. People stumbling. No one wants to come here, but here's where they end up. I know it. Your friend in the kitchen sure as hell knows it - Shut up. - And now you know it too. So you've had your eyes open, one eye anyway. We'll see about the other. See if you can stay off the menu. - Shut up. (cage banging) Fuck Who are you anyway? - Name's Roger. Nice to meet you. - Holy shit, you're Roger Foster. - Let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice. You wanna be a pet and you gotta eat. Don't forget to eat. - Eat what? - Whatever they give you. Table scraps mostly. It's a real garbage diet, but you'll choke it down. If you want to live that is. Out there we eat them, in here they eat us. - So what are you saying? I'm supposed to let them fat me up so you can eat me for breakfast. - That's just being negative. Priced pig lives a long and happy life relatively speaking. You don't want them thinking you're angry. Sad is okay. You can put your sad eyes. Maybe a whimper (indistinct) I can whistle. (Roger whistling) (ominous music) (cage banging) - Oh, my God. - What are you doing? - I'm getting out of here. - No, my God. Listen to me, do you really think it'd be that easy to go. (indistinct) be here if that was that easy? No, (indistinct) walk around (indistinct). Even in daylight it's dangerous. You don't have a plan. You haven't been here long enough. You don't know what you're doing. You're going to be walking around blind. - My eyes are open you said it yourself. - I said you had one eye open and that's not what I was talking about. - Yeah, well, in the land of the blind the one eyed man escaped. - In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is labeled a heathen and executed for telling everybody what he sees. Stop what you are doing I'm not going. - Fine, suit yourself. (suspenseful music) (creature growling) - Stop. You don't want to go in there. (dramatic chords) (Lamb screaming) (door squeaking) (Lamb screaming) (creature growling) - [Roger] This is it, feeding time. It helps if you think of it as one last meal (indistinct). Go on take it. (creature growling) (Lamb screaming) Hold on to something. (ominous music) (creature squealing) Don't stare at eyes. - Don't forget to smile. (Lamb screaming) A little whimper may be. - Hey it's me. - Oh, my God. - Okay, okay, okay. - What are you wearing? - Don't even ask. Where is Griff? Where's the Wolf? - (indistinct). - What? Who? - You think you're important now. Oh, you don't know what you've done. - Come on. - Oh, God. Hi, Roger Foster, nice to meet you. - Save it. What am I, the prize? You got something of equal or greater value to leave behind. - We gotta get out of here, which is the way back to the tunnel. - Uh, tunnel, that tunnel is a bad idea. I tried to go through that tunnel and I got this for it. - Wait, no, no, no we can't (indistinct). The thing is the beacon, we have to get- - Forget the fucking beacon. We have him that's proof enough. - That's true. We can't take the tunnel. So listen, there was this Mexican girl that came in here sometime ago. She told me she came up here through a Creek with her friends, right? Some kind of underground waterway, probably for flash floods where they paved it all in and then make your- - What is the point of this. (suspenseful chords) - Point is I think if we can get to that waterway, we might be able to get out of here. - Okay, let's go, we have to go. - (indistinct) thank you. Hold on. You can't just go out there Willy Nilly. Those mud pots will swallow you up and cook you through. Now I've been through this door several times. There's a trail off to the left, goes through the tall grass and leads to the foothills. Just follow me. You know what, I just thought of something. My mother's gonna be happy to see me. (unsettling chords) (creature growling) (Sable screaming) Go, run. Keep going. Get outta here, run. (ominous music) (gun banging) (suspenseful chords) (Lamb laughing) - Fuck. Please, God don't let me die here. If you want to do it just do it fast. Just do a fast. (somber music) (Lamb screaming) - Fucking bitch. What the fuck are you doing? - Oh my God I'm so sorry. I thought you were one of those things. Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay. You just hit me in the head with a fucking rock. - I know, I know, let me see. - Oh, my God you're bleeding.
