His Lordship's Will from a novel and play by Hjalmar Bergman "ROGER MANOR" Bother! Uncle is still asleep. Well, we've got time for a swim before he wakes up! Beat you to the beach! Sirius and Singoalla aren't here. You'll find the kids are gone too. Yes, they'd left last night for the hunting lodge. Jacob! Blenda! Birdie! Lassie! Jacob! Have you seen the children, Johnsson? No, but the stalls were already empty last night. Goodness me! Silly old chook...! Mrs Enberg has her knickers in a knot again, eh Johnsson?! Do you know what His Lordship said the other day? That if Jacob is to have a surname... ...it will have to be Enberg, as he can never be called Toni's son! I wonder what Blenda's surname should be. It's not easy to keep track of family relationships in this household. What are you sighing about, Toni? How can I get Jacob to stop hanging onto Blenda's skirt? But you promised that Jacob will go to agricultural college this autumn. Yes, but Blenda doesn't want that he should travel. That's a tricky situation... ...because, "what Blenda wants..." I can't fall asleep. It says in this book that you fall asleep... ...if you look at your own stomach for a long time. [Sagas of India] But your stomach has to be bare. Strip off then. I don't dig Buddha! Can't you read "Moon Rocket" instead? Come down here! – Go on, read! – I can't see... where were we? Yes, here it was. Chapter 4... ...what happened when Lu Ching Chang after 3 hours of silence, shouted... Heck! You naughty boy! Can't you act normally?! Forget about "Moon Rocket". Come on, let's get dressed instead! You haven't seen the children, have you, Vilma? They're sure to come when they get hungry. Yes, hurry up! Hurry up, or we won't have time. 2 choices, Wickberg Still asleep, are we? We've been asleep for 17 minutes. Have you seen the children, Wickberg? It's hard enough keeping track of His Lordship. Isn't it terrible the way His Lordship spoils Blenda the way he does? "Father's little sweetheart..." What will become of the poor kid, when His Lordship passes away some day? "Abundance declared", gentlemen. Fiddlesticks! Do you think the rector will take care of the girl? No way! Jacob! Take a look at this! Yes, you can see all the way to Bjorkenas and Klockeberga. And it all belongs to Uncle! I pity whoever will have to figure it all out. Nothing we need to worry about. Wait! Is Toni really your dad? Yes, you know that. Who's my dad then? Is it Uncle? Yes, so it's said. We both have illegitimate fathers. Such damned carelessness, eh? Do you know what uncle said the other evening? No. He said that I would marry you. So what did you say? I laughed. Then he got angry. But then he made up, and kissed me on the mouth. Jacob! I turned my head away, so he mostly kissed my ear! – Again! – Nope! Not one more! Pooh!... You're silly! Such as the conditions are in that house, you have to keep yourself presentable. My brother's colossal fortune... Mum, you're going there for his birthday ...not to his funeral. One first, the other later. I've written to advise them of my arrival. You are coming too. You'll be respectful! Imagine if we come his heirs. Mail, Mr Wickberg! The morning papers... ...and two love letters from the family! I can tell by the seal. Excuse me, gentlemen. The dean's wife, Julia Hyltenius... ...announces her arrival due to the birthday the day after tomorrow. And her son Roger with her! P.S... "The dogs should be kept confined." No bull is allowed to graze during the time she stays at "Roger Manor". So Lady Muck is coming? All I can say is one true word... fiddlesticks! The bell! He's ringing! Where's the tray, Mrs Enberg? The strawberries... and the sour cream! Hurry up, woman! Can't you have it ready?! You hurry up yourself! Johnsson, find the children! How shall I keep them out of the way on the birthday?! Shoot them, Mrs Enberg! That's the only sure way. Your Lordship... My Lord Chamberlain... My Lord Baron Roger Bernhusen de SARS... Roger... Roger my pet... What did you say... you creep? My snuff! Frigging good snuff of his! Can't understand how you can afford such good snuff. Are you taking my pan? Was there snuff in the pan? Tell me then! The wine is just the right temperature! Give Mrs E a kiss from me. Then of course you both deserve one! The mail has come, Your Lordship. No, forget it. The tray! No, no, no... mind my gout! You have to think about it. Wickberg, tell me... How old am I, actually? In two days you'll turn 70, Your Lordship. Yes... reaching the age of respectability. As far as years go, at least. Pass me my stick. Your Lordship still displays admirable vigor. Yes! Frigging hell, I've got vigour! No, look, there's little Roger... ...in his nightshirt. Frigging hell! Do I have to get so ugly... ...before I die? Take me, God! Take me! We can assume that on Your Lordship's birthday... ...there will be tributes of great respect. Whatcha say? Why do you have to look so creepy? It is most likely... ...that her grace, the dean's widow, will be here to congratulate you in person. Julia? That bible-bashing bitch! Your Lordship, please! You really are a creep! After all, she's my sister, not yours! Her grace has announced her arrival here at "Roger Manor"' tomorrow. - Where's the letter? - Here, Your Lordship. Watch out, Blenda! Yes, you were quite right... She IS coming. ..."to kiss my brow"... "and call down the blessing of He Most High..." "...on the twilight of my life." Yes, the twilight is dimming. Uncle! If you're not tipsy, Uncle, could I come and give you a kiss? Shut up! Wickberg, tell her I'm very tipsy! His Lordship wishes to inform you that he is very tipsy. Pooh to you, dirty old uncle! Bye bye! Remember, Wickberg, that I was also young once. As young as that naughty little brat down there. Well, I'm not sure I can remember being THAT young! But in that direction. Remember I had a little lassie who I always saw, like Jacob down there. Yes, I remember. And do you remember who separated me from that the poor girl? Yes, dear Mr Roger, I remember. Oh my! You do have a good memory! Her name's Julia. And she was my sister! Where is it written that we should have her son as an heir to "Roger Manor"? Nowhere, Baron. HERE it is written... Between the lines! Earlier on I'd leave everything to old-age homes... ...for disgraced chamberlains, or ex-actresses of dubious reputation. Tell me, Wickberg... What's the name of that fellow who lives in town? Lives in town? Yes, the one who robs me! Don't go stupid on me now! I mean my lawyer... That fox, Bjorner. He's going to come right away. I intend to draw up my will. Your will?! For the benefit of my daughter, Blenda. Daughter? But is Your Lordship quite sure that... Miserable creep! How dare you insinuate?! Get out of here! - Wickberg, stop! - Your Lordship... Tell Mrs Enberg that she's a fat old... ...opossum! Her strawberries are mouldy. The sour cream was watery! A blind pig would reject it! And the wine was only fit for boiling crayfish in! Get out! Wickberg! Come here! At your service, Your Lordship. All my older servants are to go! I don't want old rats anymore, rooting around behind my back! - Where are we supposed to go? - To the poorhouse! I'm going to build a special wing for incompetent servants. Anders Wickberg thanks you for this show of recognition... ...after 50 years faithful service. There was nothing to thank for, Wickberg. Wickberg... ...old friend. At you service, Baron! Don't stand there listening at the doors, you damn creep! Well, have you found it today? No, I've been looking for that blasted ball all night! You can wait until tomorrow. No, I don't want to wait. Maybe you think I'm a dog? But I don't have to obey his lordship! - I want to go inside now. - You have no willpower! Haven't I?! Let me go! You're tearing my dress! Will you say you've got will, will you....? Will you say you've got will, will you, will you? No, I probably don't anymore. I'm tired. Can't you carry me? You being so heavy?! But I'll pull you instead. Lift your feet. If you wear holes in the soles, you'll get a beating. From whom, may I ask? From me of course. Oh, what a sack of flour! What would become of you, unless I raised you... ...with fair discipline and love. You look funny... like an old man sitting there. – Am I an ugly old man? – No, you're not ugly at all.. Come and sit here. - Why are you sighing? - This is so beautiful. Why can't it always be summer? Damned mozzies! The one who got to sit here all night and play alone all over the world. So this is where you are?! We've been looking everywhere for you, Blenda. So that's how the story ends! Should I get the red room ready for the county chief? As soon as someone dies on a farm, he's there writing everything down. Then he gets paid so well, there's nothing left for the heirs. Is everything in order for the rector's widow? Yes, the dogs and bulls are inside. What about the children? No, they're running around. No, higher! No, lower! Much lower! How peaceful it is today, when everyone else is in such a hurry! That's Birdie! Fiddlesticks! It's too bad, I know, Birdie and Lassie! But now freedom is over. The Devil's grandmother, that is the rector's widow, the smirking shrew... ...she's fearful of tails! What are you up to, Johnsson? I'm saying goodbye to all my favourite spots. Do you feel your end approaching, dear old Johnsson? Not at all, but I DO feel the approach of the rector's widow. Who's tied up the dogs? The rector's widow's orders. Beware of defying her! Who is this "rector's widow"? You'll very likely know soon enough. How great to be here again at last! Hello, Nils. How are you and your beloved master... and Wickberg? No, look, are the Ajaxes still alive? How long has it been since I saw them?! I've not been here in ten years. My beloved "Roger Manor"! Roger! Are you going to stay there standing with the horses all day? May I ask? I'm so happy! Drive, Nils! The Devil's grandmother is like a gentle west wind compared to the rector's widow. I once happened to be the target of her tender flame. Yes, that was at that time when I was a young, handsome hunter. Then one was happy for a kiss in the haystack. But the old baron gave me a pension for good behavior... ...and beer for life. And so I retired to my "leisure with dignity". The safe place is the hunting lodge, up on Mount Ararat...... ...high above the imminent flood-waters. How about you and I go with him? And stay in the lodge while the old dame is here! We'll stay a week... Just you and I. There'll be me as well. Speak of the Devil.... Better get a move on! Whoa! Isn't that Johnsson? Poor old thing looking very mossy. Yes, I'm the same age as the rector's widow.. Who's that young girl? That's his lordship's bastard daughter... ...sired on Mimmi, her ladyship's ladies maid. Good God! At "Roger Manor" they don't have the sense to shut up about anything! Drive, Nils! No, stop! I'd like to say hello first. I have to say hello! Hi there, Blenda. Delightful to have a little cousin. How is your father? Do you mean... uncle? No, my mother's brother... your father. Fine, thanks. That's what he got for "little cousin"! A splendid reception, Jacob. Hey... welcome! What a dope you are, Jacob! The old bag seemed harmless! And the son was quite cute! Come on, we're going with Johnsson. No, I have to get my toothbrush. What a show-off you've become! Come on! We men are clean by nature. We do not need a toothbrush. Birdie! Lassie! Perfect, dear chap... my will will be drawn up today... And will be announced tomorrow, on my birthday. It should feel nice to receive the gratitude before one's death. What do you have to do with my death?! Have you become a gravedigger? With the exception of "proscribed heirs"... ...which according to the laws of nature passes to an idiot appointed by fate... ...I will bequeath everything I own to my daughter Blenda. But my dear chap... I'm not anyone's dear, so don't patronise me. I'll do what I want! But think of the rector's widow, your only sister! Julia is a pious woman. She doesn't care about worldly things. Apart from which, let me tell you, I simply don't like her. You look perplexed, my dear fellow. Wickberg! Bring us a glass of our best Napoleon for the county chief. We have a deserving case. But if the girl becomes heiress to one of our greatest fortunes... ...you must realise she'll be a target for all sorts of marriage speculators! I have chosen her husband. Pardon? That little girl's husband.... ...will be Jacob Enberg, my housekeeper's son. Don't be embarrassed, Wickberg. Take a cognac, for yourself, too. I'm the only one that doesn't need one. With the greatest of reverence, I apologise... ...but for your own sake, Baron, you should prepare for your sister. As Mr Wickberg pleases! Be quiet? I shan't be quiet! Where's your family affection? First he sets the dogs on me, and then servants steal my boxes! Careful what you say, Mum! And he doesn't even show himself when I arrive. I'll teach him the respect he owes his only sister, the old ruffian! 13! It's started! It's that rector's widow. Quack quack quack! There are feathers all over...! A bit of shit in the food never hurts.. I feel like I might be facing a bull. She was already furious when she arrived! Last time she was here, she left quick as a flash. I can go. No, I'll go myself. She's absolutely furious! I'll go with you anyway. She can only kill me.? Take this with you. She dropped it. Good Lord in Heaven! Take these. - Didn't you hear it ringing?! - I'm coming! I'm coming! - Who's the fire for? - The rector's widow's room. No way! That frightful bell! She's ringing. Take this. She dropped it out on the main road. On the main road? Come in! - Begging your pardon... - I pardon nothing!! That's my box! It was out on the main road. Why hasn't my brother received me?! His lordship is busy writing up his last will and testament. His... WILL?! It shall be read out in the morning. And I ask for your grace to allow me to give you... Give me what, my dear Wickberg? Forgive me your grace, but... ROGER! My beloved brother! No... No! Oh, how you've aged, dear friend!! You look like a sick old eagle. And you look like the stuffed goose in the Wadkoping School Museum. A little moth-eaten and the worse for wear, one might say. I just wanted to beg you... now that you are writing your will... Do not give me a thought, even though I'm your only sister. No, I'm not going to. - Your sister, who is destitute! - No, don't try it on! ...and for whom you have to thank for most of your fortune! Because you married me with a woman I did not want... ...since you robbed me of the girl that I loved! Yes! And today I thank you for what you did by leaving you out of my will! So it's true what Wickberg said? It's true. How deeply can you sink, to defraud me?! I, who have always portrayed you as a role model for my son! With gout in my knees, shaking hands, fungus in my toes... ...champagne in the knees, brandy in the nose and whiskey in the eyes... Have you set me as a role model? My dear Julia, have you done that?! So your son will become a scoundrel and a renowned beast, with time?! Then I'm do nothing but the right thing, disinheriting such a creep! Wickberg! My dressing-gown! You're surely not serious?! Let me go, otherwise an accident will happen! You reject me?! You're a brute! No, but I have diarrhea! Wickberg, hurry up! We have to get the old boy to think differently, all the time. There must be a competent person who can take control of his property... ...a lawyer who knows the law and all its loopholes. Bergfeldt is an estate entailer, but understands nothing but horses. No, and Lilja at Hviskingeholm knows about nothing but ladies! And sweet little Blenda is sure to understand as little as her mother! Beautiful Mimmi DID know a thing or two. You have to try and hit it off with the girl! Me? Isn't she already engaged? You mean the Enberg boy? That guy doesn't amount to anything! I'm aspiring to become a Supreme Court justice. And after all, little Blenda is a bastard. A bastard having maximum potency. So you also believe that old story of Mimmi and the hunt-master? Well, it IS said... Ignore the gossip stories and start moving on the little bastard... now! Hey! Blenda! Hello again. We never got to talk properly. Where are your dogs? With Jacob at the hunting lodge. Is that where you're going, little cousin? You're very inquisitive, aren't you?! They say you're engaged to Jacob. Nonsense! I'm certainly not engaged. You're not? That's good. Shall we take a little walk? You might be able to tell me some romantic legend about "Roger Manor". No, I can't. But Johnsson could. Though I never like to hear what he talks about. It's always stupid and dirty. Yes, men can be a nasty lot. But they often say things they don't really mean. Do you do that too? Yes, but I usually regret it. Johnsson should tell beautiful tales. They don't exist about "Roger Manor". Blenda, maybe you and I could come up with something beautiful? The fryer stuck to the stove like the rector's widow herself! Put the coffee on. Blenda will be here soon. The way she runs along the main road! Girls have a thing about roads! Light the juniper twigs to keep the mozzies away! Go find Blenda! This is good for your poor dear stomach. Thank you. I'm going to read a nice story in "The Scandalous Chronicles". Wickberg, fetch me the book! Yes, really pleasant, dear sister. Here I lie all alone with that sour-faced creep. Here he comes... About time, too. Let's see... No! Yes, this is the one... "En retournant a la Maison, le coeur defaillant malgre son courage..." No... Roger, you have to rest. Tomorrow you have your birthday. Then we shall have a really pleasant time! Where shall Lovisa Enberg, your future son-in-law's mother, sit at the table? What? Will Mrs Enberg be joining us?! Her at the table? Well, I'll be damned! That is very likely! And I have the honour of sharing table with a servant... ...Toni, your son-in-law's father. Damnation...! Damnation! Think how tactless it would be for your guests! What'll we do? Forget about announcing your will tomorrow. Then we shall do so. But buzz off now. Go! Thank you, little brother. Good night. Listen, my pet creepy-crawly... Come... come over here. The first thing we do in the morning, is to sign the will. In private, shall we say... ...but with witnesses and accessories! What took you so long? I had trouble. Tell me, Johnsson... What does "a bastard" mean? Fiddlesticks! It's something very nasty. A deformed mongrel for example that knows neither his dad or mum. But he said that about me! Who said that? Roger! First he said I was a bastard... A bastard having maximum potency. Maximum potency? Yes, but that's another thing, Blenda my pet! They words usually reserved for royalty. And he kissed me several times. What? Did you let him kiss you? Yes. - Where are you going, Jacob? - To "Roger Manor"! I'll have a word with that rotter! You just calm yourself down, you jealous little whippersnapper! Would you bring disaster on yourself and your mum on account of that piece of shit? Do it on the sly some night, when no one's watching. Fire some buckshot up his arse, but don't wake up the manor! Birdie! Lassie! Jacob, I promise that next time I'll turn my head away. I promise! Look, there goes father moose, with his wives and children. Yes, the biggest antlers get the most beautiful wives. Good night, kids. Should I snore... ...dream of Napoleon on board the proud warship 'Waterloo'... ...which sank with all hands off St Helena! Jacob, are you comfortable? May I just ask you one thing... Do you like Roger? I don't really know... I guess you're the only one I like. You guess...? Jacob, I love you! Blenda! Pull the blanket over your head, Jacob! Napoleon is landing on beautiful Helena! Here, Birdie! Now remember what you have to do. You'll ruin the whole party otherwise. We'll soon have them all here. They come to pay tribute to the old fogey. Look how they swarm out of the woods! The whole main road is full of the little creeps. And think of all this that I'll be leaving... to the kids. - We'd better hurry... - No, wait a moment... Shall we wear the Chamberlain's uniform? or the Colonel's...? I dare to suggest that we wear the one that fits best. Very sensible. Hurry up, then! Look at those cows, rushing across the fields! The music's scared them! Do you know what I'd like? To see Julia straddle one if those cows... ...galloping all the way to Stockholm! Oh what a scream it would be... ...to see her riding past the palace changing of the guard! Do not laugh so heartily, your Lordship. He who laughs in the morning... ...can come a cropper by evening. I'd come a cropper anyhow, if Julia got her way. There goes the Lord Chamberlain! - Where do I have the papers now...? - You have them in your hand. Yes, without the program, I don't know if I'm coming or going. Must it be buttoned, too? Do you have to pull so hard? Can't I just wear Mrs Engberg's apron? Roger, you have to hurry! Your underlings are crowded in the yard! Julia, go down and offer the men some snuff while they're waiting. But Roger, the aristocracy is also beginning to arrive! - Tell them to go to hell! - The pastor has also come. He can show them the way! Don't you have respect for anyone at all?! Yes, for old biddies who know when to shut up! I revere them as saints! Victory! It's holding together! Open the window, Wickberg! Yes... there they are... mine! Big and small, farmers and blacksmiths.. ...mothers and husbands, girls and boys. I've seen them all grow up as seedlings from the soil... Or as chickens from a large nest. God bless your work and your rest. And you young people... God bless your games and your joy. Damn me, I think he's starting to blubber. You old mummy's boy Wickberg! It was the first time in many years, I saw the Baron stand to attention. The baron doesn't understand. Get me a brandy! The day is showing signs of being strenuous. What are all the banners about, down there? First there's the Blue Ribbon Brigade... Then the Verdand Temperance Society... ...The United Sobriety Lodge... The Friends of Temperance Lodge... That's good.. It's very good for the people to stay sober. I could join such an organisation... ...but those creeps seem to harbour prejudice... ...even against brandy and other lighter drinks! - Does he drink alcohol in the morning?! - Only a few drops for his stomach. Who is it? Your sister, who is burning with desire. Hurry up, Wickberg! Julia's burning with desire, even at her age! Is it holding now? As much as it can, Your Lordship! Can't ask for more than that. I feel like I'm wearing Armour! Eager for battle! Combat-ready! Show the bitch in! We need to conduct him out to the people. Conduct? I'm not helpless, am I?! Where is Blenda and Jacob? I can tell you that... Those kids have spent the night together in the hunting lodge. At their age! My dear Julia, night falls regularly each 24 hours... ...and must be spent somewhere! It would not have been difficult for them to be here on my birthday. Long live Roger Bernhusen de SARS! Cheers! HURRAH, HURRAH, HURRAH, HURRAH! Thank you, my friends, thank you! The colonel's wife, thank you... Dear brother! And now, Wickberg, open the portals! Let the people's homage be loud, but brief. Here he comes! - At the age of 70... -...you are an old dolt! We'll skip that. Load your rifles! Discharge! That's all that's needed when an old knight approaches the pearly gates. Long live our beloved master, chamberlain and colonel... Commander of the Royal Order of the Sword... Royal Order of the North Star... Royal Vasa Order... Order of the Italian Crown... Russian Order of Saint Anna... Knight of the Spanish Order of Isabella... Order of Mauritius and Lazarus... And the Greek Order of the Savior! Long live our beloved master, chamberlain and colonel... The Devil take you! Is it right for a man to toast his own life? Well... Long live the old fogey of "Roger Manor"! If it really has to be done... – Long may he live! – HURRAH, HURRAH, HURRAH, HURRAH! Well cheered! Very well done. Dear friends and faithful servants and tenants... ...my heart is overflowing... Quiet Mr Baron, sir...! It's not your turn yet. It's written down here... The kids are first! Get yourselves together! And then go up the stairs to the baron... ...and do what you have to do. Long may he live! Long may he live! Yes, may he live for 100 years... Well, I'm not going to manage that... ...if these kids keep fooling around between my legs! Long may he live! Long may he live! Yes, may he live for 100 years... Squad, attention! Raise arms! Shut up kid, or I'll have you shot! Watch... here's the salute! Fire! That awful noise! I must go inside! My nerves! Out of my way! After the salute, the baron will convey his sincere thanks... ...to each and every one of you. – That's what the rector wrote. – Really? Thanks everyone, it's been damned nice! Now I'll retire to torture! Yes, you did well, kids! Really well! Hi sweetheart, do you know where Blenda is? In the hunting lodge with her fiance. - As usual. - Damnation! "Sweetheart"...? What a jerk! Hey kid, would you like this? First you show me the way up to the hunting lodge. Keep it, I'm going back to the drinks. That tribute was impressive... and that was just the beginning! In a quarter of an hour, the clergy... and then the school board. And at 2 o'clock you're hosting lunch for fifty people. Wickberg, say no to the lot of them! Say I've got foot and mouth disease, and my sister's got hen fever! Hear that Wickberg? He called me a hen! I only heard him say hen fever... ...but it usually prefers to attack hens.. I've issued the invitations... Now you repudiate me! I'll be on my way! Wickberg, put her ladyship in the 4-wheeler. And close the carriage door well, so she doesn't fall out and walk back! You old beast! What time would madam like to leave? Never, Wickberg. Never! Dear Julia...! The biggest scandal in living memory! This is not the time for hysterics. The will is signed! The only possibility to modify it to your advantage... ...is to show him kindness. I have to be nice to him?! No way! Julia...! Wickberg, send Nils with the surrey, and bring the kids home from the lodge. I want to see their faces, when I read the will. Jacob! Hello! Why have you come here? I wanted to see little cousin, who so shamefully ran off last night. Did my uncle ask for me? I'm sure... A day like this! I should have congratulated him with coffee in bed, roses and beautiful verses... ...that old hobgoblin! But when all his fine relatives are there... ...the bastard would only be an annoyance. Blenda... I'm in despair. Can you forgive me? I was so upset, because... ...I'd thought you were a nice person. Little cousin, tell me you forgive me. Otherwise I'll be inconsolable. Yes. Thank you. Maybe Uncle wants to make me disappear? So he doesn't have to be ashamed of me. Cheers! It was really kind of you to come and see an old hermit. I was very happy to get the invitation, Uncle Roger. It's so calm and pleasant here, as long as it lasts. So, you're sitting in here? May I join you, DEAR friends? As if anyone could stop you! No, it would be our pleasure. Wickberg, get a place mat for her. "Could stop"? "Would want to stop", don't you mean? I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No, of course not. We'd started on a very interesting topic. We were just talking about illegitimate children... own and others. What about Ankarstjerna? Didn't he have an illegitimate boy with the housemaid? No, it was with the governess. Bravo! You're the real expert on this subject! Toni! Fill us up, and then you can go to blazes. But old Ankarstjerna was thoroughly cheated by that girl. We shouldn't cast aspersions willy-nilly! There was a young, very handsome forester working on the estate. HE was the child's father. How can you possibly know that? I just know for certain! No, what you're actually saying...! You probably remember him, my friend. He came here that summer when I and my maid lived in the wing. That was the year before Blenda was born. Everyone understood what was what. It was just you who understood nothing. Wickberg! What do you think you're doing! Sorry, madam, I just dropped... Just keep calm, Wickberg. I feel like smashing a glass, myself. But whose health shall I drink to? That little god Cupid's? You pierced my heart so diligently... ...both sharply and ruthlessly, you little rascal! But I do praise you on one point... You never shot with poisoned arrows. And now I'm probably too old to drink your health. Therefore... ...I empty the glass... ...to my daughter Blenda... And to her blessed mother... ...the very dearest little friend I ever had. No one shall drink from that glass again! For, strange as it may sound... ...that glass... was holy... ...to a cynical old heart. Your arm, Wickberg. If you'll forgive me, honoured guests, but the old boy needs to retire. How touching, eh?! Now you've done it! You'll soon have nothing. That may have happened, but I have a son! So far, I've already received Miss Blenda's forgiveness. First, you speak ill of her... then you kiss her. You scoundrel! ME, the scoundrel?! Boys! You can be heard all the way up to the cottage, where the girl is! Come on boys, go down to the creek. It's more private there, and you can wash the blood off! You keep out of this, you old fool! - Johnsson, talk sense to the boy! - Of course! I'll pour the spirit of reconciliation into you! But wait... ...accept one piece of advice... Take off your jackets! Scram! I'll sort this rotter out! Rotter, eh? Go to it! This is looking good! But Jacob, let me hold your knife. It's not worth risking the electric chair! That's the way! Boom! Yes, that was well-aimed! Fiddlesticks! I think our Jacob's getting thumped! How about that law clerk! Didn't think you learned that sort of thing in the courthouse! Now our Jacob's starting to get really angry! What are you two fussing about? Hurry up, boys! I hear Brenda coming. Then the sabbath calm is over! Jacob, just give him one more, for the hell of it! "Gotta keep yourself in perfect nick. At fighting time, it does the trick!" No Birdie, you can't join in! Jacob! Roger! Whereabouts are you?! That's a sight for sore eyes!... The Supreme Court judge himself flattened by our little Jacob! Shut up! Grab my hand. What are you two up to?! I fell over and got a scratch. No point in lying! She knows we've been fighting. Blenda, this wasn't a common fight... It was a real match! In the old days people looked down on a brawl. But nowadays it's called a match. Because people are more educated! Get the surrey. - Try to get up. - I must have sprained my ankle! Get lost! Don't show up here till I'm back at school! I don't want to see you again! Gipsy boy! So, that's the way its... That's how you say thanks and goodbye? Well then... We'll see what I can come up with. Jacob, what are you going to do?! Worried I'll give your sweetheart another beating? Oh no, Miss High-and-mighty! Bye bye. Enjoy yourself. Jacob, come along and get the surrey. No, I'm going to get my gun. There are foxes in the area. Does it hurt a lot? Looks so yucky! "Sweetheart", he said. The cheek! Thank you, Blenda. "The cheek"? Why was it that? He's just a little boy. Yes. But you've has grown out of such childishness, right? Yes, Birdie... ...a lot of things are starting to happen. But if he takes the girl from our Jacob... Go get 'im! He's taken the girl from our Jacob! Blenda is engaged to Mr Roger! What's Nils blabbing about? Where's Jacob? Lovisa, where are you going? I feel sorry for Mrs Enberg. You did this so well, my boy! You did this so well! Please Mum, take it easy! Oh yes!! But where is your beloved little Blenda... my adorable niece? She went to talk with Uncle. That Jacob... Wouldn't it be best to make peace with him? It could well be worth it. I guess I could look for him. Jacob would have been so full of himself, if I hadn't yelled at him. Do you not like Jacob anymore? Well it's obvious! No need for you to ask. At first I was just going to tease him, but then... And then? What then? Roger said we should get engaged. You aren't mad at me, are you Uncle? My dear kid... You are so damned like your silly little mother. I could never be mad at you. What do you say about the big news, my beloved brother?! Isn't it lovely that my son and your daughter have exchanged vows today?! You took the will, Bjorner. Give it to me. Here you are. What are you doing?! A little while ago, it would have made you happy. Now it makes you miserable. Life is full of surprises, little sister! I do not think this young lady is able to take care of herself. Even less, a couple of large estates. Yes, off you go. On the other hand, I think that Jacob Enberg is. I'm going to make him my sole heir. It's not my fault that Blenda prefers me. You should get some compensation. Shall we say 5,000 kronor? Start running, you milksop, if you value your life! Scram! Go get 'im! Who's shooting?! It's Jacob! He got his gun! Jacob!! It's all gone too far. The riff-raff wants to kill us! Wickberg, look after his lordship. Wickberg... a little eau-de-cologne. Frigging dog! Good dog! The police should come and arrest Jacob Enberg right away! Yes, for attempted murder of my son! Jacob! Where is Jacob?! Johnsson! Mr Roger has been shot! One more or less won't affect the flea-circus. They say he's as good as dead! She's leaving this house! All she does is attract disaster! See to it that my sister and her son are on the evening train! Who is it? It's Jacob. Show the scoundrel in! Baron... It wasn't intentional. It's not Rogers fault that Blenda... Skip the lass. Go on...! He behaved like a boor. When I was prepared to give up on her voluntarily... ...he offered me... cash! Should I sell her?! But the shot... Did it hit him? Oh, I would have said if I'd shot him! I threw the gun away and then the shot went off. Look here! Jacob! Jacob!! Uncle, The police mustn't take him! The rector's widow rang for the police! I only love Jacob! You have to get away! She said you are an assassin! Hide him in Uncle's closet! Get her out! I'm not going! I just love Jacob! Pull yourself together. You're upsetting his lordship! Jacob, my sister's coming. Take Blenda out by the back stairs. Quiet! The rector's widow is coming. Wickberg! The snuff, if you please! Roger! Are you prepared to face me?! Not for a moment. Bless me! Before you say anything more. you shall hear what I have to say. Do not take the will merely as a result of my whimsy. That's not the question right now.! Hell and damnation, will you sit down! - I'll stand. - No, you're not going to cross me! SIT! If I could understand what it is for a damn idiotic feeling... It's like those two kids Jacob and Blenda have infected my blood. Maybe that's why even though I sit here quite alone... I sometimes hear through the window... That was a big bumblebee! And then you hear... A little bumblebee! And they buzz out of one bush into the other... You wouldn't have a frigging clue as to what I hear, sitting here. It's burning down there in the bushes... ...and the old man breathes heat, and sticks out his frozen hands. And then he gets the urge to play providence. A providence for us poor earthworms! Put the catechism in your back pocket, for I know it better than you! I'd never expected to get my plans so damned mixed up! Don't swear so much! I believe you! So, you do, do you?! Then perhaps you also believe me when I tell you... ...that you should receive the reward of your deeds... ...for calling up the police! Wickberg, bring in a bottle of punch... and the inspector as well! Roger, calm down! I'm starting to get anxious! You've no reason to be anxious... ...if you only promise that for 5 minutes you'll follow my wishes. Yes, of course, of course! Come in, Inspector. Highly obligated, dear friend, to see you here. Yes, the entire situation was a happy misunderstanding, But the rector's widow herself said... Dear oh dear, my poor sister...! Now, now, little Julia, drink a glass with the Inspector. Here you are, Inspector. My poor sister has suffered all day from the most severe nerve crisis. What a shame! Your health, Madam. Cheers. The day has been a bit strenuous for a sensitive heart. What a shame... A bad heart? Cheers! Cheers! But my sister is not ungrateful. Therefore, she asks, with the glass in hand... ...that as a penance for her inconveniencing you, Inspector... ...that in this family setting... ...we dispense with titles. That would be a terrific honour for me, I must say that! Roger! What do you mean by this?! That you hook arms with the guardian of the law. As they used to call us. My name's Charlie, in case you didn't know, Your Ladyship. Julia. Thank you, Julia. You look a little happier. Take him out before he starts kissing us on the mouth too! Give him food and wine. The Baron is tired. Well then, I'll just say thank you. Goodbye then... Julla. How dare you scandalise your own sister! You don't seem to mind being scandalised by your underhand attempts for gain! And that without results, for Blenda will still be my sole heir. I presume you realise she's not marrying your son. Sorry, Your Lordship, but Madam's train leaves in 45 minutes. Oh well, it's time for separation Au revoir, my dear. We'll probably never see each other again. Goodbye, brother! Farewell... ...sister Such a lot of fuss because he's so obstinate about his will. – Only that? – Yes. Soon he'll ask: "Who the hell said those nobodies should inherit?" No, come along, I want to talk to you. Please Jacob, let's not. What? Are you scared?! Great balls of fire! I truly believe that... How about you be a nice girl now, and talk about everything... ...just as it really is. No, you just don't understand me at all! No one on earth understands me. It was naughty of Uncle and you to arrange this. You ruin everything for me What? Everything that's fun. - Don't you want to marry me? - No... Jacob. Don't you like me kissing you? Of course I do! But in the name of all the saints, why you don't want to get married? Jacob, what if we were to get married... What would we do next, then? You see, I like fairy tales so awfully much. But if we get married, what would become of the fairy tales? – Become of the fairy tales...? – Yes. If we spend our whole lives on the estate taking care of the crops... ...and cattle, maids and servants... Fairy tales are fun just because you think... ...that one fine day all those wonderful things will happen to you. Jacob, tell me you understand...! It will be so boring otherwise. Couldn't it be a fairy tale that we got married, then? No, Jacob. It's all just nonsense, what you're saying! All lies! Shall we go now? You go. Nice doggie! You'll see that she'll have changed by morning. - She's on her way! - And you should have seen the train! You'll get the best cut of meat, for taking her away from here! [Christmas Eve dinner - some months later] – It's yours! – Yes, can I have it? Lovely.. No, Karlsson should have it. Where are the children? Toni, go and look. - Here she comes. - Jacob is coming soon. Sorry, Aunt Enberg, I must say good night to Uncle before I eat. Yes, as the oldest of us... ...I shall propose the toast to his Lordship. Very insensitive for him to get sick with foot and mouth disease... ...just as dinner was ready. Cheers! You're such a nosey creep, aren't you?! You have to know everything! Alright... this is my new will. And the last one! Who's that? I'm so tired. I can barely function. God, what a day it's been! When they said Jacob would be arrested... Then I knew where my heart was! So, where was it then? With Jacob? Not at all... with "Roger Manor". That a "Roger Manor" boy would get arrested... I never imagined I'd survive it. You and I would get on well in the grave. I like everything very much about you, your dear old ugly creep! You do? Yes, but I have to go. I think Jacob was unhappy. Goodbye. In she flew... out she flew... Alas, yes... youth and summer evenings. They're what we remember, eh? Then only the signature remains. It is a very significant name. It has been written on many important documents. Do you see, Wickberg... That, that's ME. Jacob! Jacob!! Yes, what did I tell you? She's already regretted it! Jacob! You really are a crazy kid, you are! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
