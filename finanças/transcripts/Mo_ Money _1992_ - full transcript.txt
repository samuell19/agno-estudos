Died at 1:13 a.m. Messenger for the Dynasty Club Corporation. It appears to be another hit-and-run. I just don't understand it. Yeah, it is pretty insane, Lieutenant. I mean, how do they get the jelly into these things? Huh? Any of your men touch this? No, sir, I gave specific orders not to move anything. Well, somebody did. I wonder what that means. - I don't know, sir. - Lieutenant. Me neither. Thank you. Here, hold that. Oh, boy. Get me that case. I'll deliver that myself. You wrap everything else up over here. I got a few things I got to do. Yes, sir, Lieutenant. Hey, anybody got some paper? Smells like you need The Sunday Times. Hey! Like I was telling you, man, I had that little bitch by the neck like this. I start twisting it till it snaps. Pow! I almost killed that little ho. Then mom come running in, talking about, "What you doing to your sister?" Yo, she's lucky, man. They both lucky. You know, pop, pop! Two for one, that's right. She's my mom, but she ain't breastfeeding me. Right. Now Mom talking about pressing charges on me. Man, I don't give a damn blam sam. Forget the peanut butter and jelly. I'm ready to jam! Right!

I'm considering postponing your case for a few months just to let you think about how you're wasting my time and the taxpayers' money. But since you've been so ill-represented by "the propaganda of the court structure," I'm going to have a sympathetic decapany on this case. Dismissed. Thank you.

Yeah, come on, come on. You were sweating in there, kid. You're not as tough as you think you are. Yeah, well, thanks for getting me out, Walsh. Me? Are you hungry? Nope. Well, I am. I thought you were supposed to be working. I quit. I'm sorry? I said I quit. Oh, I see. You quit. Then maybe I should quit trying to help some little street punk make something out of his miserable life. What happened to the job I got you at Cluck-A-Bucks? Yo, Walsh, they had me in a giant chicken costume handing out coupons. It didn't go with my image. You don't have an image. You're unemployed, you're invisible. You're not even a statistic as far as the system's concerned. John, a job is a job! Tell that shit to them white boys downtown! So you're going to have to try a little bit harder! It doesn't matter if you clean shithouses, as long as it's honest. Well, I ain't cleaning no shithouse. Just take a look around you. Is this it, John? Are you going to be happy with this the rest of your life? You tell me what it is that you want to do. Maybe a cop like my father. Come on, you don't have what it takes. Talking about your father, let me tell you, he was the... "Best damn cop ever." And he's dead! What's that say about cops? Well, not too much, according to you. But he was a cop. He was my partner. And he saved my life. You understand that? He was stupid because you're here and he's gone. I can't help that, John. I can tell you something about your old man. We're on stakeouts... God, not again. What about Seymour? What does he do with his life? Drugs? Play Cornbread? Who's he got to look up to'? You? You're too involved with yourself. Go ahead, turn your back on me like you always do. Hey, John, it ain't going to fall from the sky! You got to work for what you want! Look at me, at least. I'm yelling at you! It was about 90 degrees. Hey, Johnny! Sweet and sour pork, very good. How'd you like the lawyer? Filthy. Move, crackhead. You out, ain't you? Guess you won't be coming to my concert. This is the artificial intelligence designed to cut down on fraud and unpaid charges. We developed this through interviews with over 300 Dynasty Club authorizers. Basically, this computer can determine credit approval. So, the computer makes the decision on who gets credit and who doesn't? Who would've guessed? Technology. Remember when you had to heat an iron on the stove? I have no frame of reference, Lieutenant. I'm a product of the computer age. Another tough question. Yes? I lose my credit card. I don't report it. Someone finds it and goes out on a shopping spree. Please, sit. Thank you. Does the computer pick up on that? Well, yes and no. It may be more difficult during, say, Christmastime when shopping is heavier. But on the whole, it's very effective. Ain't that something? I hate to be so pedantic, Lieutenant, but I believe it's "isn't that something?" Isn't that something? Yes, it is. It's also a shame. What is? Mr. Forrest's death. I think it's a shame. Could I get a printout of the names on that tape? Certainly. Anything else I could do? No, thank you. Oh, and uh... Thank you for the English lesson. Yo, come get some of this. I got what you need. Get high off of this. Hey, yo, check it out, baby, eye up, lady. Come get some, lady. Hey, baby, you look good. Hey, Miss Lady, ma'am, buy a book for Biff. Tell Mom to buy you a book. Screw you. I'll knock them freckles off your face. Hey, hey, customer's always right. Knowledge is the key. Reading is fundamental... Johnny, people don't care about their children's futures anymore. That's why Bush is in office. Walsh said I'd go to jail if... Fuck Walsh! He don't care about us! You can stay here and sell these damn books. I'm going to get paid. Ladies and gentlemen, knowledge is the key to understanding and learning, and... Damn! Here we go! We going to get paid today. Yo, my man! Shaft! Little Jack! Play a game of three-card. Here we go, red card. You want the red card. Look for the red. Excuse me. How much is this book? For you? Free. Take it. Nothing in America is free. Love is. Oh, really? Besides, your kid will like it. I don't have a kid. Yes, Lord. Give me my $2. What happened to free? It's America, remember? This is a great book. You should read it. Oh, yeah? Yeah? Could I read it to you now? "The Ice Cream Dream." I wonder what that's about. "I wish I had an ice cream. "It'll look just like you. "Sweet-tasting chocolate, good all the way through. "I'd lick it slow from head to toe..." You're fresh. I'll take my book before it melts, thank you. Come again. And again and again... Never the black, never the black. You want the red card. The lady wants to play. All right! Oh, no. Try your luck, make a buck. $10 gets you $20. How do you know? Trust me. I sell children's books, remember? Come on, Miss Lady girl. Always the red. Open your ears, hear what I said. Here we go! Here we go! What you got? You sure? Yeah, she wants the right card. Barn! All right! Yeah, a winner! Winner, winner! It ain't impossible.

You want this one? You sure? Come on. Ah, she won! Another lucky winner! I think she won all that. Didn't she win all that? Oh, you won it all! This her lucky day. You just going to take the money and run? I won it. What the hell are you doing? Sold me out for a piece of ass. What am I supposed to do? Sell those books. Sell some books? Shit! Stupid! Excuse me, miss. I didn't get your name. Amber. Amber. Ooh, I like that. Excuse me, Miss Amber. Do you think we could get together for lunch? Someone press seven, please. I'm busy. Hi. Remember me? How about dinner? How about breakfast? How about... How about a drink? Water fountain's right over there. Yeah. She wants me. ♪ Never trust a big butt and a smile, that girl is... ♪ I'm here to apply for the mailroom position. Did you fill out an application? No. Here. Fill this out. Good luck. Thanks.

Ah, come in. Hi. Some interesting responses here, Mister Stewart. It says here that you attended Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Four years of work, work, work. I thought Mount Holyoke was an all-girls' school. Uh, no, they changed that. Probably as soon as I got there. You wouldn't happen to be related to Tracy Stewart, would you? That's my aunt. He's a man. His wife's my aunt. You should have put that on your application. It could only help. Tracy truly is an asset to this company. He keeps things in order around here. He's funny about nepotism. I'd rather do this on my own, so I would appreciate it if you wouldn't mention my name to him. You certainly have personality. Listen, I'll, uh, review your application and, uh, check out a few references and get back to you in a couple of days. Oh, this is your correct telephone number, isn't it? Yes. Yes, sir. Good. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Next, please, next. Yo! Bighead! Yo, what took you so long? I been home and back. Did you talk to her? Yeah. Did you get her number? So what took you so long?

You used to be my best customer. Now you bust me because I wouldn't do a freebie? Right, liar. Get that whore away from my door. See what you started? Come on, Mary. What happened to us? What are you doing? I'm up for a promotion. Lieutenant, I phoned the coroner's lab. Autopsy confirmed that Forrest's broken neck was not sustained in the accident. Didn't I say that? It was inflicted... After the fact. Now it's official. So anyway, everybody's laughing and having fun, when all of a sudden Stanley jump up and run out the house. He done forgot his Depends!

I'll have to get me some gloves. Let me ask you, what do I do with this? That's a credit card that Mr. Geoffrey wants cancelled. The idiot didn't break it in half like he's supposed to. Why break it in half? Our credit cards go out preapproved. They have to be processed before being cancelled. I see we got a new guy here. Johnny Stewart, this is Keith Heading. He's head of company security. Hi. Hi, Johnny. Hey, did you hear the one about the psychiatric patient? "I'm having weird dreams. "Last night I was a wigwam. The night before, I was a tepee."

Terry, how are you? Yo, Chris. Is that you? Yeah. Why you crying, man? You constipated? Mmm-hmm. You should try rocking back and forth. That's what I do. You said it would take an hour. It's been an hour and a half. That's unacceptable. Alison, file this, please. Hey, what happens if I push this button? How did you get in here? I work here. What can I do for you? It's my lunch break. I was looking for someone sweet and pretty to talk to, maybe show me around. You wouldn't happen to know someone like that? Actually, yes. Yes, I do. Oh, yeah? Yeah, Charlotte.

I don't think so. No? I love your smile. It's beautiful. Thank you. Amber! Amber! Let's go! I have to go. That's your boss friend? He treat you like you ought to be treated? Amber, let's go!

Would you? I mean... Go ahead. Chris, Lieutenant Walsh. Nice to meet you. He just wants to talk. Just a few questions. About what? Don't worry. Ah, life. - How you doing? - Not bad. How do you like this office? Well, it's just great. Nothing. He just asked me a bunch of questions about the mailroom. Did he ask anything about me'? A couple of things. What did he ask? Just who you were. What did you say? Nothing. I played dumb. I knew the cops were going to find out. This is just getting way out of hand. I don't know how to handle it anymore. Listen, you did real good. Don't worry. Just go on home, and I'll take care of it, okay? All right. Sasha. The things we did to each other aren't even in books. She had a set of headlights on her...

I got to talk it over with my husband. Get a haircut. Husband, what you doing? Sometimes I feel like a nut. Sometimes I don't. I feel like slapping the shit out of you. So anyways, husband said I could put it on my Dynasty Club card. Great. He's so good to me. Now, what you whining about? You hit me. There you are. Of course, I will need to see a driver's license. You done gave me your cold already! Am I supposed to run out the store every time I open my mouth? Damn! Here you go. Stop it. Tell you what. Why don't you just read it to me? Certainly. 0-6-9-1 -3 D-I-C-K. Expires whenever. Here you are, gentlemen. Enjoy your ring. Ain't he so sweet? I'm sorry. Did we get you? No. Bye, doughboy. We got stuck. Bye-bye. Bye. Hope you wash your face. That shit was sweet. Yo, we could sell that for $100, at least. $100, man, that's crackhead prices. For her? I'm keeping this. Yeah. You better get that girl a mood ring. Look, then get me a leather jacket. Just a jacket. And a hat. And a hat. No, and a shirt. And a tiger-skin blanket and some snakeskin. Yeah! Mo' money. Mo' money. Mo' money. Mo' money. Amber-poo, open the door. It's Tom. Go away. Amber. I just want to talk to you. I have nothing to say to you. It's over. Amber, you're being irrational. You'd open the door for the fucking mail boy! Yes, I would. You know why? Because he's nice to me. He doesn't treat me like a piece of shit. I've got a joke for you. What does a man with a one-inch penis have for breakfast? You give up? This morning I had baby food and therapy, lots of it. Keith Heading told me that joke. How did you know where I lived? I followed you. You followed me. My dreams need detail. So what do you want? I brought you something. Where is it? Go ahead, man. Hey, fatso! Give me your wallet! Here! Here today, gone tomorrow. Found this on the platform. His name was... Chris Fields. "Darren Clinton, Lloyd Bradley, "Tony mason..." Here, let me see that. Boy, this kid had credit. Stealing? Man, that's ridiculous. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, no. No, no. Not one, not two, but three Cartier watches. Five Italian suits from Elite Wear. Flight limousine service. Let's see. Dinner at Lu Chan's Yum-yum chm sum. The list goes on and on. You've got good taste. Look, man, I don't know whose list that is, but... I love this part. Hey! That looks just like you. Wait a minute. That is you! You know that's a federal offense? See, I had you checked out, Johnny boy. You're on probation, right? Right? I put the cards there. It was just a matter of time. I'm a pretty good judge of character. Cut your bullshit, man! Are you calling the cops, taking me in'? No! I hired you! I do my affirmative action bit. Besides, it wouldn't benefit either one of us. I got something much better in mind. I want you to look through returned credit cards and bring me these names. What if I don't? You go to jail for a long time. Now get out of my face. I hate thieves. Hey, what you all standing around for? You look like somebody died. It's Chris. He got stabbed to death last night. Damn. I'm sorry to hear that. Excuse me, everyone. As you all know, due to a very unfortunate episode last night, Chris is no longer with us. I've just been informed that Jonathan Stewart will be Chris's replacement as mailroom supervisor. Good luck. You're the number-one guy. - Over? - Over. This is the easiest shit we ever did. And it's over? Like that. Barn! Are you crazy? I don't want to do it anymore. Oh, come on, Johnny, man! Yo, do you know how much shit is out there that we didn't get yet? Yo, I saw this dope four-finger ring. It says "Seymour" going across here. And one said "Johnny." With thumb attachments. Sound like handcuffs to me. Come on, man, I saw a crocodile sweatsuit. Are you going to play ball in the jungle? Why are you bullshitting, man? Yo, we could get paid. It's not like they're going to find out. We get paid... They did find out! Keith's trying to blackmail me, so just leave it alone. Okay? It's over. Damn! So I guess you don't want to hear about the mink socks. Get the damn meat out of here! This is way over my head. I just don't understand. What don't you understand? Well, the whole thing. Could you explain the whole system again? A credit line is determined... That part I get. There's a bank of information on everyone's spending patterns. The computer rejects any abnormal purchase. Abnormal purchase. Yes. What? Well, I found these receipts on the late Chris Fields. These are some really big purchases. $30,000, $72,000... Now, I checked these against my printout, and the funny thing is, every one of them are deceased. So I asked myself, "Do dead people shop?" I can't believe that fat little mailroom clerk must have got into the system. Ain't that something? You're right on time. I like that. There's your cards. Whoa, whoa, Johnny! This is great. This is really good. We got some shopping to do. I thought you said all I had to do was get you the cards. Johnny, I lie a lot. Come on, this is going to be fun. I like that hat. Kiss my ass. Don't be sad. Life is good. You just need some direction. Yeah, you're going to take care of me, right? You with me? Torn! Johnny! Come on. That stuff in there doesn't concern you. The only thing that concerns you right now is this list and this card. Be nice. Get some clothes, too, will you? You're in the big time now. Charge it. John.

I hit the lottery. You know, I've watched you spend money like water for the past couple of weeks, and I wasn't going to say anything. Just please tell me it's not drugs. It's not drugs. I'm serious. I'm serious, too. It's not drugs. Look, I'm doing it for you. For me? Okay, for us. I like being able to take you out to nice places, to buy you things. I want to give you the things you want.

I got you the promotion. You're making that extra money. You got that nice girlfriend. I don't understand. Yeah, you wouldn't. Let's just say I know when to throw in my cards. I guess I was wrong about you, Johnny. Yep, I guess so. Fine. Fine. This shows its a stolen card. Security is on its way. Stop, you son of a bitch! Come here! I'm going to kick your ass! Hey, you bastard! Ha, you fat bat! This is Detective Lawrence with Dynasty Club security. He wants to know where you got this card. Maybe shoving my foot up his big ass, That will get it out of him. You're so tough. Take the cuffs off and see how tough you are. You got it. What you doing? What are you doing? All right, come on. Go for it! I think he'll cooperate. This card came through the mailroom at the Dynasty Club. We also know that your brother Jonathan works for them. We figure your brother gave you the card. No, he didn't. Then who did? A white guy. What's his name? I don't know. They all look alike. And smell like baloney. You... I'll kill you, son of a bitch! Now you tell me! You are going to tell me what you know, or I'm going to beat it out of you! Talk, damn you! All right, all right! I know this guy, this dude. His name is Keith, Keith Heading. Keep it up! Here's the deal. I know this guy, right? He owns six travel agencies. He wants to use your phony credit cards to purchase airline tickets at full-fare prices. Then he's going to sell those to his customers at a lower fare than any other travel agency can offer. He's willing to be 50-50 partners with you, Keith, or give you $25,000 a card. 25G. And there's no risk involved for you. I don't know what you're talking about. Look, Keith, Johnny told me everything. Yeah, Really? Come on, Keith. You can't beat this with a baseball bat. Listen to this. Look, man, if you ain't the top guy, tell me who is! 'Cause I ain't got time for games. I don't like to be set up! What are you talking about? If I was trying to set you up, don't you think the cops would be here with their guns out? Oh, shit! Help! Jesus Christ! Who authorized this sting? You did? Well, that's great. No, thank you, Sergeant. I think you done enough. Let's get out of here! Doesn't the billing department receive complaints? From who? They're all dead. Oh, then you have to go to Walsh. No. He'll just tell me I fucked up my first legitimate job. I got in myself, I'll get out myself. You need evidence. That's in the system, and I can get it. No. I don't want you involved. I am involved. John? Oh, Johnny. I need credit card numbers. I gave them all back to Keith. Wait. I got receipts. Here. Shit! They changed my access code. Johnny! Seymour! Shit! Come on. Lloyd, put the little dick in Dilton's office. Eddie, check the mailroom. That's it. I'm going crazy! I have to get Seymour. Let me help! No! Hey, stupid! Oh, you fuck! Are we having fun? Peek-a-boo, I see you. Come on, let's go. What about the tape? Forget it. We got dead bodies. Oh, wow. What are you doing here? Ran out of donuts? No. I came for credit. You okay, Seymour? Of course, he's okay. I wasn't talking to you. I thought by now you'd have your shit together. Obviously, you don't. Take us both to hell. Johnny, shoot him. Shoot him! Come on, test me out. Shoot him, Johnny. Close the door. Fuck you! Close the fucking door! What are you waiting on? Stay with her. Hey! What the hell you guys doing? What are you... Son of a bitch! You are crazy! Come on, Johnny! Get me out of here! Yeah, come on, Johnny! Catch me if you can! You ain't saying nothing, bitch! Watch the lady! You're crazy ! Aw, shit! Oh, shit! Sorry! Move it, you piece of shit! Shit! I got to go see my brother! You again! You again! Son of a bitch! Damn! Don't be sad. Unit three to home base. I got a situation here. You know something? I have no use for you anymore. Son of a bitch! Shit! Where's my brother? I hope he's dead. Then you're going to join him. Oh, Johnny! I'll kill you, you stupid fuck! I'm a pretty good driver, huh? That was close, Johnny. Hey, where are you going? Look at me. I'm not going to hurt you. Come here! The difference between me and you, Johnny, is you play fair! Hold this, Johnny! I told you if you fucked me, I'd kill you. Well, you fucked me! Remember when I told you to kiss my ass? Well, kiss my ass! Here we are, Mr. Kahn. Please, not so quickly. Excuse me, nurse. What room is Johnny Stewart in? I said, what room is Johnny Stewart in? 332, down the hall, to your right. Get out of my face! Thank you. Son of a bitch. Yes? Flowers. You won't be needing these, Jim. Let's go, let's go! Come on, an emergency! What's up? Oh, am I interrupting something? No, sixth toe. Got you some flowers, bro. Oh, how sweet! No, he probably took them off some dead guy or something. Yo, Johnny, I was thinking, and I came up with a master plan. We sue the Dynasty Club and get paid for workman's constipation! Look, no more scams. You need to settle down. With who? I know a girl. Is she cute? Now, what's my name? Is she cute? What's my name? Is she cute? Seymour! Hey, what's up? Yes? Long time, no see. You're looking beautiful! I got you some flowers, baby.
