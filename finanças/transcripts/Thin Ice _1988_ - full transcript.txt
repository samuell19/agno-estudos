- Uh. Uh. Go away, go away. Uh. Uh, uh. (snoring) Please. Uh. Stop, stop. Go away. Uh, uh. Uh. What are you, who. (screaming) - Vince, Vince. It's me, Ross, your roommate, remember? It's okay, you're just having another one of your nightmares. Hey. - What's that? What is that? - This? Just a little night music. It helps me sleep. You oughta try it sometime, with the way you've been waking up lately. - I dreamed that I woke up and there was nobody here, it was like I was isolated from everyone in the world. I was walking down these barren streets and this cloaked figure was following me. And he takes off, and so I start chasing after him and I'm running and running, we're running for miles through empty buildings and through alleys and I finally catch him, and I pull off his hood, and you know what I saw? Ross, I saw myself. I was standing there looking at myself. I was like, more alone than I was before. - Vince, man, listen, you're probably just letting everything get to you, you know? You got your play next week, you got finals, man, you gotta learn to take it easy, man. Deal with school like I do. - Right, you're failing every class, Ross. - (laughs) And am I losing any sleep over it? No. - I don't know, I just wonder sometimes. - Look, trust me, loosen up, man, forget about things. You'll feel better. Then maybe you'll be able to sleep as good as me. - Yeah, yeah, maybe you're right, maybe you're right. - Of course I'm right. Now, get some sleep. Oreo? - [Disc Jockey] 102.5 FM GZLT, that went out to Jenny, who says she's glad to finally be done with her last exam. If you'd like to request a song, the number is 677-1025. Well, school is out for the semester, but don't forget tonight. Oregon State hosts the University of Washington in PAC 10 basketball play. And weather for central Oregon, it's gonna be a warm weekend, highs should reach into the upper-- - Bus log, diary date December 14th, this is Captain Vince Fuller of the star bus, Booby Prize. This entry marks our departure from the strange galaxy of Oregon State University. From here we begin our journey to the home town planet of Los Angeles. And so the voyage has begun, into the unknown, the meaningless, the absurd, where we shall stand firmly against injustice, cruelty, and other bad things. If we can just figure out what they are. As a wise old guru once said just before attaining complete unity with the cosmos, don't take life too seriously, man, 'cause you'll never get out of it alive. After all, could we not summarize life itself as just one lengthy stage performance with no intermissions? What strange, unknown marvels lie before us? What great achievements of valor and bravado await us? And will Mom have dinner ready when we get home? - [Dad] I've been thinking, son, have you ever considered the promotional end of the theater? - Aw, come on, Dad, please, this is a very old and worn out topic. - [Mom] It is worth thinking about, though. - Yes, it is. It is worth thinking about. And I'll think about it, okay? Can I have the salt, please, Mom? - Well, I know you're not real interested, but if you ever change your mind, I have a client, Steve Cather's his name, he's a promoter. And I'll bet he'd have some connections for you. - By the way, Vince, tomorrow's Sunday and your father and I have started attending a very nice church. The Seeleys down the street, you remember Mr. and Mrs. Seeley. Well, anyway, they invited us to go to church with them and we met a lot of really friendly people. I think it'd be good if you would go with us tomorrow. - Church, huh? - Oh, come on, son, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. Pastor really had something to say. (laughing) - You're going to church? Come on. - The cry of every person is, I want to be free. Many understand freedom to be the liberty to do as you please. We read in the Old Testament that every man did what was right in his own eyes. Freedom is not the absence of all authority and restraint. Think of a train. A train that ignores its rails is no longer free to move. The rails that give freedom to man are responsibility and truth. On the one hand, we must accept responsibility for our own lives. On the other hand, we must let our lives be directed by God's truth. Jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Jesus Christ is the truth. - [Vince Voiceover] He makes it sound like if you don't have a commitment to Christ, then you're some kind of prisoner. Wonder what would happen if I jumped up and shouted out, excuse me, sir, but where's the line to get your ball and chain, because according to what you just said, I'm not free at all. People would flip out. Probably excommunicate Mom and Pop. I could just shout it and then dive into the aisle. I could escape through the back doors. I'd have to knock down that big guy there, looks like some kind of a guard. But if I ran down hard enough, boom, he'd go right over. - [Pastor] Freedom to be what I ought to be, a child of God. - Hi, I'm Nick Martin. - Hi. - I don't think we've met. - No, I'm up in Oregon most of the time. Vince Fuller. - Right, right, right, right. I met your father before at a businessman's breakfast. - Yeah? - Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that we have separate meetings for people our age, in case you wanna meet some new people. - Great. - I have a schedule here somewhere, anyway, we meet Thursday nights at seven and Sunday at eight, and the rest of the week we do your typical college age stuff, you know, like going bowling and going to the beach or hit a movie. - Sounds great. - [Vince Voiceover] Why am I saying this? - Yeah, you'll have to come along sometime. Oh, oh, oh, I don't wanna, I don't mean to hold you up. Look, here's my work number. Give me a call sometime, if you need a ride or something. And I have your folks' number at my house. - Great. Well, just give me a call if something comes up. That'd be great. - All right, great, man. - Nice meeting you. - You, too. - Okay. - Bye-bye. - [Vince Voiceover] What are you, crazy, Fuller? (phone ringing) - Hello, Fuller Estate, Vince speaking. - Hi, Vince, this is Nick Martin. We met at church today? - Right. Yeah, what's up, Nick? - I know this seems kinda like a strange offer since we just met, but there's a bunch of us, that we go up to the mountains on a sorta ski trip. my folks have a cabin up in Tahoe. You're invited if you want to come. And it's next weekend. And don't worry if you don't know how to ski. Do you? - Yeah, I ski. - Are you busy next weekend? Well, actually, it's Friday through Monday. - No, I'm not too busy. - [Nick] Great, there's so far five of us going, most of us are friends of mine from church, so I doubt if you met any of 'em. - Church, huh? ♪ Come on choir ♪ ♪ Come on with me ♪ ♪ All you got to do ♪ ♪ Is just reach out and try Jesus ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ - Vince?

(laughing) (screaming) Hey, you guys. Oh, that's great. - Woody Wells, sorry about the bursey wuss attack. We thought you were bush whackers. - Hey, don't worry about first impression, guys, Vince, this is Woody Wells, - Woody, I think we met. Thank you very much, appreciate it. - This is Xalton Stiles and Woody. - How you doing, nice to meet you. - This is Trish, this is Alton's little sister. - Hi there. - Wait a minute, why am I always labeled little sister? - Well, because I'll always be your big brother. - And you're Shawna, right? You go to school or college with Woody, don't ya? - Yeah. - Hi, I'm Nick, and this is Vince. - Hi. - Nice to meet you, pleasure. - Nick, Woody Wells, how ya doin'? - Hi, hi, Woody. Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Anyway, so Xalton over here takes it upon himself to place his own trail. And he's cutting in and out of the woods, trees and he doesn't see the avalanche signs. - Wait a second. - Hey, you. Which were all over the place, but he doesn't notice, he was into his skiing, you know, and so all of a sudden he looks up and there was an avalanche, and for the first time he was paranoid, ahh, boom, down the hill, he got swept, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, bah dah dah, he's down the hill, he's all over the place. (laughing) And bam, right into the ski chalet window. Right into the window, and not a scratch. Not a scratch. I loved it. - Yeah, that's very entertaining, Woody, but the reason I didn't see the signs was because somebody had plod 'em all down before I got there. (laughing) - You're gonna see a lot of that with these guys. - Yeah. - So when'd you become a Christian, Vince? - Well, uh. - Xalton, I don't think everyone here is necessarily Christian. - Nick, you don't mean. You can't mean. There are pagan skiers in this very room? - I'm afraid so, Woody. - No, help. - Oh, no, he needs CPR. - I need you, baby. (laughing) - Get outta the way. I need you. - Huh? - I thought you said this was, this trip was supposed to be with a bunch your friends, not with a convention of preachers. - Well, they are my friends. - Woody, you're a lot of fun to be with, but you have got a lot to learn about life. Why didn't you tell me that this was, that you were into all this Christian stuff? - I'm sorry. I did not think that it would be such a-- - It's too late now. Look, I just hope that I don't have to hear anything about God, about Christians, or about pearly gates. - So, where are we going tomorrow?

Same one you guys go to, my parents just started going there. - Any reason? - My mother thinks it's social. - No, I mean you. Is there something between you and God? - Well, no, I wouldn't really say that, no. - Listen, Vince, whether you realize it or not, if you haven't accepted what Christ did for you on the cross, then there is something between you and God. Our sin has caused a separation in the relationship between God and us that only he can fix. - Okay, great, Xalton, that's great. I understand where you're coming from. And I respect that, but I don't think this religion thing is for me, okay, okay? - That's fine, it's your decision. I just hope you realize the choice you're making. - I do realize the choice I'm making. Can we leave it at that? - Not really. As much as you don't wanna face it, one day, there's gonna be a judgment for our choices here on Earth, and I think you should know that judgment is for eternity. You are unholy, evil one, and you shall be thrust deep into the bottomless pit. Only now, could you be like me, divine and holy and never parting from the narrow path, not given to any form of idolatry. Blasphemy, adultery, drunkenness, slander, uncleanliness. Slander, uncleanliness, all forms of worldliness. These things are called abominations. And if you haven't asked for forgiveness, then you're in rebellion against God. - Great, great. - Anyways, I've made it as clear as I can. But if I were you, I'd do some serious thinking about it. - I will. - Hey, that's okay. - How you doin'? - Fine. - All right. - [Xalton] The rest is up to you. Because right now, you're walking on thin ice. - Who's walking on thin ice? - Xalton here was just telling me all about how he can walk on water. Let's go ski. - Vince isn't too receptive to the gospel, is he? - Hey, gang, would you look what I found in the attic? - All right. - Hey. - Official bobo transportation of 1802. - Those are great, buddy, those are great. Fat web skis, exactly what you need for the slopes. (laughing) - Hey, very funny, Nick, I'll remember that next time I pull you out of the snow bank, huh? Gee. Hey, there's another pair up there, does anybody want to do a little nocturnal snow shoeing? - Hey, 20 bucks and being all railroad? I'm outta here, gang. (laughing) I'll try it out. - A novice? - Yeah. - Well, then let snowshoe Woody give you a few lessons, my son. - All right, all right. - Oh, give me a break. - We're about to be enlightened by the snowshoe guru. Let's do it-- - Aaahhh. I love you, let's get outta here. - How you doing back there, Denna? - I think I smell engines. I think we should wait here a bit. - Hey, great man isn't getting tired, is he? - Heck, no, just trying to protect my shoes from the savages. I know you don't see 'em, but they're here. - I appreciate the protection man. - Coulda used a little protection from Xalton a little earlier today, so I hear. - Ah, oh, no, no big deal. He's just lucky I didn't get mad and use my snowshoe fu on the guy. (grunting) - You know, that might not have been a bad approach. I don't know, I don't know about Xalton. I don't get along with the guy too much. We sorta have nicknamed him the Pharisee. (laughing) - Hey, what's with that? I thought you were one of the Christians on this trip. - Oh, you mean the dope? - Yeah. - You mean, you don't do-- - Huh-uh. - Ah, well, I, way. Yeah, I'm not into the heavy duty righteousness stuff, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, there's better things to do in life than go around being a monk. You know what I mean?? I mean, I'm human, too, you know. I need to get my occasional kicks just like everyone else. I mean, what's an occasional joint? What's integrity, man? It's just a concept, huh? I mean, I carry my bible on a keychain. It's subtle, it's quick, and it just has the words that I wanna see. Do you know what I mean? Seriously, because just because I'm a little bit more into God than you are, I'm really not that much different than you at all, really. - Yeah. I guess you're not. Okay. What do you say, Grizzly, ready to get back to the fort? - Let's do it. - We're outta here. - Ow, oh. Whoa. - Hey, hey, hey. - Hey, hey, hey. What's up? - Not much. Just checking out what you're reading here. What've you got? - A little Tolstoy, "Resurrection." - Huh. - You ever read it? - No, can't say I have. I'm strictly a Hardy Boys man. - Is that right? - Yeah. (laughing) - So what are you doing tonight? - Mm, nothing. I basically came over here to ask you a couple questions, though. Is that okay? - Sure. - How did you get into all this? - Christianity? Well, actually, it started when I was in high school, Vince. I was struggling, searching for answers that I didn't have. I started partying a little bit. I was confused with my life. But I met some Christian guys and when I was in college, and they turned me on to some material, I started reading it, and I got interested. - And so all of a sudden, overnight, boom, you're a Christian? - Well, not exactly like that, but. See, Vince, I was brought up in a church. And it always seemed so meaningless to me. All the people cared about was their formality and their tradition and I thought all I just had to be good. But for God, that's not enough. - Okay, so what made the difference? - Well, the difference, Vince, is there's someone that'll always, always care about you. And your life. And you're not alone out there. Here, lemme show you something. Read this part right here in red. This is a conversation between Jesus and a man who asked him about life after death. Go ahead, read that. - For God loved the world so much that he gave his only son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life. - You see what that means, Vince? We all mess up. God loves us so much he gave us his only son to die for our sins. So we could have another chance. Now it's our choice. - So that's, that's it? It's that simple? - It's that simple. But it's not always that easy. I still have my struggles, my problems. But now I know I never have to go through 'em alone. - Thanks. - Anytime. - [Disc Jockey] Good morning, it's 7:32, I'm Crude Morris, KSLN. - Hey, you know, if you brush 'em any more you're gonna blind somebody when you stand in sunlight. Okay, just step aside, c'mon, man. - Hey, come on, I'm awake. - What? - I gotta comb my hair. - Forget it. - No. - It's a lost cause, buddy. - Hey, you wanna have a morning pepe? (laughing) - So you guys ready for bible study this morning? - Um, so, I was thinking about postponing it and cutting it out, Shawna does not go for this. - Well, why do we have to change some things just because Shawna doesn't think it's-- - Xalt, Xalt, maybe Woody's right. - Yeah. - Let's get together later on. Us and Trish, okay? - All right. - Okay, fine, whatever. - Cut you down. - Don't do that. - Bad news, guys. The plows won't have the roads cleared until this afternoon. - What? - Oh, dear. - Okay, wait a second, so skiing is completely out? - You got it. - We can't ski? - Wait, you can't ski anyway. - Hey, come here. (laughing) - So now what do we do? - Well, don't be so pessimistic, kids, I mean, there's plenty of fun indoor games. - Yeah, like what? - How about an exciting game of Charades, huh? (cheering) - The day I play Charades is the day I die. - [Woody] She's dead. - [Nick] "Death of a Salesman" You're dead, right? - [Woody] You're dead, but your eyes are open. - [Vince] Uh-oh. - [Woody] It's a movie, it's a movie. - "Night of the Living Dead." - Return, uh. - "Return of the Living Dead." - Superman. - Wait. - I got it, "Night of the Return of the Revenge of the Living Dead." - Ha. (screaming) (laughing) - It's a classic. - Well, that's enough for me. Who's up for some sledding? - Right here. - It's too cold. What we need is a good party. (laughing) - [Woody] Come on, Shawna, what do you call this? - Oh, yeah, right. You guys went to college, you go to college, right? You know how to party. - Well, we don't really have that need. - Oh, I stand corrected. What about you, Nick? I can see you letting loose. Don't you get sick of all this school book stuff? - Hey, I have my party animal moments. Hey, you've seen me ski haven't you? - All over the place. - Yeah. You got potential. Let's take Trish here. Trish, why are you doing this Christianity thing? I mean, why are you, you're so good all the time. - I'm not, I wouldn't say I'm all-- - I mean, who are you doing this for? For your parents? For yourself? Who are you doing this for? - Hey, what does it matter? At least she's on the right track. - Whoa. You really take this seriously, don't you? I'm just trying to figure you guys out. - I'm gonna go pack some lunches if anyone wants to go sledding. - Need some help? - Vince, do you guys believe in this whole Adam and Eve thing, too? - And I suppose you've studied about it. - No, not lately. - Well, actually, it's pretty easy to see why people have trouble with it at first. I did, Shawna. - Woody. - There's a lot of good books on creation, I think if-- - Would you please help me out here? Do you believe in this whole Christianity stuff, too? - Yeah. - Well, at least you don't let it ruin your fun. - Which makes an excellent Christian example. - Oh, listen to you. Is it better to go around and preach to everyone like you do, huh? - Now this is getting interesting. ♪ Was I not born up in the sky ♪ ♪ When all there was was you and I ♪ ♪ So far from you ♪ ♪ I was not made to walk alone ♪ ♪ I was counted in a holy war ♪ ♪ Now you're leaving me notes on my door ♪ ♪ Sending on the shore ♪ ♪ You're leaving me notes on my ♪ ♪ I went in search of a greener place ♪ ♪ Like some lost art in outer space ♪ ♪ Ship lost at sea ♪ ♪ John and was writing from a make ♪ ♪ I was drowning in a holy war. ♪ - Yeah, I guess I meant it at the time. But I was mad. And then every once in awhile, you know I get out of hand. But I really felt hurt, Xalton. I mean, I know I'm not an ideal Christian, but I wish that you'd care a little more about me than what I do all the time. - I don't know, Woody, this is really hard for me, because I have a hard time with people who-- - Say one thing and do another? - Yeah. - Yeah, I know I've blown it. But so have you. I mean, Christ did not die so that I could party hardy. But he also didn't die so that you could go around thinking that you live up to his standards. I don't know, at least I'm admitting that I'm wrong. - You know, you're right. The worst part of it, I guess, is that I start feeling like I'm better than other people. 'Cause I don't do the sort of things that seem like real sin. But if what you do is like the love of God without the obedience, then what I do is like the obedience without the love. And that's real sin, all right. I'm sorry, Woody. - Me too, man. I never knew you felt like this. Guess we help feed each others' problems, huh? - Yeah, I guess. - [Woody] Come on, Vince, get in. - I'm not doing it, man. You're a spastic gorilla, man, I'll push you. - Get in, you wimp. - C'mon, there's lots of room. - Come on, let's move. - Let's take it easy start the run. - Okay, I'll push this one, ready, Conan? - All right, Conan. (screaming) - Woo. - Hey, are we in the hot seat here, or what? - What do you mean? Oh, you mean being the only non-Christians in the group? - Yeah. - Yeah, I hear ya. - Look, I don't mind most of them, but that Xalton guy, I'll tell ya. - Yeah, he gets pretty bad sometimes. - Yeah. - I don't think he means it, though. - I think he does. - Uh-uh, he was talking to Woody earlier and I heard the guy said that he was really down on himself for being so hyper holy around us, and he admitted he was wrong. - Maybe there's some hope for him, I don't know. But I mean, this whole Christian thing, hey, it's the 20th century. - Yeah, yeah, but Nick's a great guy, right? - Yeah. - So what's the great insight of the 20th century, anyway? - Good times. (laughing) Good times. Party, good times. That's what life's all about. See, what did I tell you. I mean, that makes a lot more sense to me than believing in some invisible god who tells you what you can or cannot do. I didn't ask to be here. I mean, what god would tell you don't have any fun or you're going straight to hell. - No, no, that's not what they believe. - Yeah, yeah. - No. - That's what they believe in so many words. That is what they believe. And you know something else, it's definitely not my lifestyle, that's for sure. - Maybe, but what I'm wondering is, is my lifestyle any better? - I don't know. - Where are those guys? I can't make the spaghetti without the Xalton secret sauce. - Xalton, we're trying to concentrate here, okay? 725, 726. - Look at this. Three hours to get 10 bucks worth of groceries? - Frescas. - Oh. - Hey, Woody. - Hey, we stopped to get one beer, one. And, but she didn't want to leave. - That's great. Look, you can do what you want, when it's just you. Everybody here is waiting on the groceries. - I hope I wasn't too late. (laughing) Oh, excuse me. 'Scuse me. I was wondering if we can just get together and gather around this altar here, so I could do some spiritual exortations on the merits of taking wine? (laughing) Oh, come on. Come on. Okay. You guys wanna be deadbeats, it's cool with me. I'll just go find myself another party somewhere else. Right, Woody? - Don't you know when to stop? Can't you see that we've blown it here? And that you-- - Uh-oh. I think I see a halo. He wants to be a good Christian tonight. So be it, Woodrow. - Hey, Shawna, what's wrong with being Christian, huh? - What is it like riding the fence? Huh, Vince? Does it hurt? You're in no man's land, buddy. You're nowhere. Either you ride the straight and narrow for Christianity or you don't. Or, you could be like Woodrow here, the hypocrite, at one instance, you say that you're a Christian, are you really a Christian? You don't get points with God. You don't just all of a sudden say I'm a Christian and then the next day, say, I don't know, and the day after that say I'm a Christian again. And don't tell me about this Christianity stuff, 'cause I know all about it. And you know something else? You might be right. Church boys, at least you stand up for what you believe. You, my buddy, my friend, you don't even know what you believe. And I feel sorry for you. I'm outta this dump. This place stinks. - No, Nick. I started this, I'm gonna finish it. (car sputtering) - Oh, no, no, you come here. - Stay away from me. - What do you mean, you stay away from me? - Just stay away from me, Woody. - Oh, get away from you. (screaming) The wine was real cute, you know that? - Come on. - Leave me alone. I am so sick of this holy roller Christianity garbage. I am sick of it. Now I just want you to leave me alone, just leave me alone, okay? Leave me alone. - Shawna, listen, if it means anything, I know I come on too strong, and I've been out of line, and I'm sorry. Hey, I wouldn't blame you if you don't want to forgive me, Shawna. But please don't hold that against the others. - Shawna, come on, let's go in. I'll make everyone some coffee. - Oh, you're such a nice, sweet little Christian girl, aren't you, Trish. - Okay. - Everything is so neat and together. If anything got outta line, you'd get a little crazy, wouldn't you? You know, I'd never be accepted into your Sunday school picnics or your prom nights, would I? I'd love to go in and have some coffee with you, Trish, but I just don't have the time. - You know, Shawna, you're right. I probably have been much too sweet to you. I was just hoping that maybe somehow, underneath all that anger you have in you, that I could find somebody I could be friends with, somebody that I could like, but no, instead you've got this incredible thing against Christians. And there is no way in this world we're ever gonna make it with you. You know what your problem is? - What? What's my problem, Trish, huh? - You won't let anyone near you, that's what your problem. - Yeah, right. - That's right. - Don't even tell me that. Right. - Trish, where are the mushrooms? - They weren't in the bag. I guess they didn't get any. - No mushrooms? - Hey, Woody. - Hey. - She still out there? - Yeah. She wants to be alone. Hey, you guys, I'm really sorry about all this. I feel so stupid right now. - It's cool. - I think I'm gonna need a little bit more oregano. - Oregano, here you go. - Hey, you guys, I don't know what's going on, but Shawna's taking off into the woods. - What? - Crazy. - What? - I'll go with him. - Hey, Vince, why don't you stay here with Trish? Hopefully this won't take long. - Okay, yeah. - Keep stirring this, all right? - All right. - Okay. - Keep stirring. - How long do you want me to stir? (tense music) - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so obnoxious, Woody. I can't help thinking about my daddy. - Your what? - My father was a preacher, you know. - What? - Yeah. He was so good, Woody. I used to sit in the front row, so proud of my daddy. And I can still hear him if I want to. God loves, you Shawnie. Yeah. One night he was walking along this road, he was trying to get to a gas station, and he never made it. And the next day, they found his body. They still don't know who or what hit him. And you wanna know, you wanna know something? You wanna know how the Christian people treated my family? You know what the church did to us? My mom, my sister, and I were like outcasts. They didn't know what to do with the preacher's wife. She worked so hard to support us. And the church didn't help her out because she wasn't on staff or anything. And they expected her to go on with all her volunteer work the way she used to. After all, it was her duty. I miss my daddy so much. And that is what the Christian church did to me, Woody, that's what they did to my whole family. It's the only kind of Christian love I know. I don't know. I just miss my daddy. - I'm sorry. I never knew. Will you forgive me? - Yeah, what if you forgive me? (laughing) - You're forgiven, a long time ago. Let's get outta here. - Okay. (screaming) (coughing) Woody. - You know, it's been almost an hour. I hope everything's okay. - Everything's fine. She's probably sitting under some tree, being drunk and sobering up. - You know, you really outta go easy on her. I have a feeling that underneath all that anger there's something really troubling her. - Whatever. You know, you two make an unlikely pair up here. You're pretty funny. - She scares me. I don't understand her. I've always avoided girls like her, they've always avoided me. - Help, Vince, Vince, you gotta help me. She fell through the ice. - Talk to me, man. - Shawna fell into the river. - What happened, man? - Shawna fell into the river. - Shawna fell where? - Shawna fell into the river. She's down in the river. - What river? - I pulled her out. - Is she okay? - I couldn't carry her. She's gonna freeze to death. Hurry, Vince, she'll die out there. - All right, all right, it's gonna be okay. - Just couldn't carry her. - Shawna. Shawna. Shawna. Help. Help. Somebody help. Hey, help. Hey. Hey.

She's fine, she's gonna be fine, okay? Look, I gotta go down there, make sure she's okay. Great spaghetti sauce. Freezing. - I am, too. - Why don't you go in, I'll get some firewood. - Do you need any help? - No, just go for it, I'll get some wood bring it in. - Sure? - Yeah. - Okay. - [Nick Voiceover] The difference, Vince, is there's someone that'll always care about you and your life. - [Vince Voiceover] For God loved the world so much that he gave his only son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. - [Shawna Voiceover] Buddy, you don't even know what you believe. And I feel sorry for you. - [Vince] Coffee? - Well, thanks, who trained you? - I think some zookeeper somewhere. It's cold outside. - I have a confession to make. - Well, speak, my child. - No, I mean it, Vince. I used to be afraid of you. - Why? - 'Cause you're not a Christian. - Oh. And that makes me some kind of a monster, right? - Well, I guess I thought so. But you know, you're not a bad person. You see, I was raised in this really strict Christian family. And I was always told that people who went to parties and did things that I wasn't supposed to do were really bad people. But I guess that's not always true, is it? - No, it's not true. I mean, if you never feel any guilt, if you never know you're wrong, then you don't think you're a sinner, right? I mean, I was never taught anything about God. I didn't know that God was important. I never did any reading or anything. - Are you thinking about it now? - I'm thinking about something. I mean, I've been thinking about something for a long time. I mean, before I came up here, I was saying to myself, man, there's gotta be more to life than what I've got. I mean, I go to parties, and I'd be in groups like this, but it was always held together by something, you know? Like drinking or drugs or something. I mean, we had a good time, I guess, I always felt really empty, though. Felt like everybody was just afraid to be themselves, for crying out loud. So I don't know, I came here and I met you guys, you guys have something real here. You guys have here what I think I felt missing. - You aren't trying to say that you're thinking about becoming a Christian, are you? - Yeah. The pay's right. (laughing) - You know, you're really silly. - I am silly, and I'll always be silly, Christian or otherwise. - Well, you know, you don't have to be strait-laced and boring to be a Christian. - Well, that's good. I'm glad. Thank you very much. ♪ Jesus, Jesus, you found me. ♪ - I got a roll. Thank you, guys. Take care, Xalton. Trish, Nick, ahh. She's never been in a fine automobile like this, she doesn't know how to get in. (laughing) - Hey, you gonna be around this spring? - Yeah, why? - Well, we have this little tradition. A few of us, we go backpacking every year, right guys? - Tell me you're joking. - Really, you'd love it. - [Trish] No, you'll have a good time. - Hey, I even talked to Shawna, and she might even think about coming. - Well, I might even think about thinking about coming, too. - Well, good, you do that. - You guys be good, give me a call.
