WILD HORSES It?s possible to live a long life without learning anything. It?s possible to live on Earth, without changing or adding anything to its landscape. As it is possible not to be dead, without necessarily having to be alive. It?s enough not to love, ever, no one, nothing. It?s the only way to avoid suffering... I decided to bet my life on the opposite. It was many years ago when l ceased considering important whether I had lost more than I had won or otherwise. I thought the world and I were even, since neither of us respected the other very much... But one day, I discovered that I could still do something to feel myself fully alive, before being definitively dead. So... I put myself in motion. Cut off! Thanks! Excuse me, friend. Can I take up a few minutes for an interview? -Buddy, can I ask you some questions? -Yes! You stay right there, it's for channel... What do you think life is like when you're an old man? What would you do if you were, today, seventy years old? Monday 12:30HS. Good morning, can you help me? Yes, sure I can. Take a seat. Peter... I?ll be with you in a minute. -Excuse me... -Yes? Peter, please answer the phone. If it's Perez, tell him I?ve got his stuff that he can pick it up at anytime. OK, Rody... If you don't mind, Let's go there... Monica, we'll use Rodolfo's office. Okay. Come in. Sit down, please... But... Have you read the note? I don't understand. Can't you read, boy?. Put the money there! Put all the money! -No, there's no money here, sir! -Put the money there! Look, look, money is kept only in safe boxes, sir!! -Come here!! -Get all the money in there! I said there's no money! You want me to kill myself? Put it now! But... What's this doing here? Please I?m begging you. Stop, that's enough! -What are you...? -I?m asking you please! I?ve asked for fifteen thousand, three hundred and forty-four, damn it! Please, I beg you, stop it! Drop that gun! -Don't aim that at yourself! -Fifteen thousand, three hundred... It?s all here! Don't move! Heads down! Aim the gun at me! Come on! But, how will I aim at you? No... Don't shoot, I?m his hostage! It?s all right, I?m all right! Don't move! Everyone to the floor! It?s all right! all right! Drop the gun! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Drop the gun! Don't shoot! Don't you shoot! Drop the gun or I?ll shoot! No, don't shoot! Everybody to the floor! Don't aim at me, it's all right! All right, all right... That's it, all right... Drop the gun! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Aim the gun at my head! Shout at me! Give orders to me! Why?. Why would l? -Because I?m your hostage! -I don't want any hostage! How will you get out of here?! Hold me tight. Tight! Follow me, follow me! No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! He's holding me hostage. It?s all right, it's okay. Nobody dare shoot! It?s fine, it's okay, don't shoot! My God! Did you see anything? What's going on here?! No, no! Stand back! Don't shoot or he'll kill me. -He'll kill me! Get back! -Easy. Take it easy! Say something! Shout at least, please! Stand back! Louder and pretend you'd shoot some other people! How do you know what's going on here? Yes, yes, yes, yes! Hey! Hey! What's wrong with you? You're not going to die right now? Can you hear me, sir? Sir, please! Listen to me... Tell me what I can do to help you. Don't dare die now! Hey! Try to remember what happened, Monica. I was just sitting here and when I looked inside the office, I realized that Pedro was being aimed at with a gun. Describe the gun, please. No, I don't know nothing about guns. I want to be on the air in half an hour! The CNN will hire me! I?ll be famous even in China! I?ve got it! I?ve got it!! -You have to wait outside. -But please... "This is a simple matter, either you give me back the money you stole from me, or I kill myself here and now." Where did you find it? I found it. Congratulations. Stop it there! There was a man here, a minute ago! There are men here all day long in this ward. -You've come back, huh? -And you've come round! -Let's go! -Listen, boy. I just want what's mine. You can do whatever you want with the rest of the money. We're appearing on TV. Nice first shots, if you know what I mean? "... but Espina, who said at the beginning that there was no robbery at all, now confirms that the money stolen by this peculiar burglar amounts to fifteen thousand, three hundred and forty-four dollars... " How come fifteen thousand, three hundred and forty-four dollars?! That's what I asked you for! The money they'd stolen from me! But I thought it was your account number. "... his own car, which hasn't been found yet. News from abroad... " We didn't take fifteen? We took... I don't know... about five hundred thousands!! What do you mean "we took", "You" took the money! I didn't know what I was doing! What is it? You think I have a suicidal old man in front of me everyday?.! But, why do they report fifteen only?. What? Why was all that money inside the drawer? -You didn't know? -How could I know? I thought you were using me. Using you? What for?... I was trying to help you not to be killed. You know what? I think we're in big trouble this time. This won't have a good ending. No! I?ll call my boss and explain everything to him. I don't think it'll be that easy to explain. You don't understand. He's my... tennis mate. Rody is like a brother to me... Rody! Where are you? No, wait. You can't imagine what happened. I?m not a hostage. You think I didn't notice that? Where are you! What was all that money in your drawer? Listen, you asshole, you think you did something smart? What do you want? You already have the money... though I doubt you'll have any time to finish counting it up? Is that a threat or what? I don't want the money! What is it, then? You trying to prove to yourself you can fool me? You want my position? I?ll stomp you! What do you want? An agreement far beyond me? Agreement?! Don't act like an idiot and tell me where you are! Peter... you better come to an agreement with me. You don't know who you got involved with! What do you have to offer? Your silence? Your silence is worth nothing, man. see? I mean, for all we care, you're already a dead man, Pedro... Wait Rodolfo! What are you going to do now, boy?. I have to think things over. Where will you do that? I don't know. Don't make me nervous. I need to keep calm. Please, forget about me. Is that all right? How could I possibly forget about you? You're in danger and that's my fault, and... Well, you should have thought that before! Besides, nobody will be killed, it's only a matter of giving the money back. I have to think of how to do it. You have some place to hide? Where no one can find you? No, I don't think so. No, no, no. Why is that? Am I a criminal now or what? I don't know, a friend's house? Somewhere they can't reach you? Yes, but... I can't go there really, he lives in Australia. Come on, come with me. Let's go! Where to? To the South. What's there in the South? They're waiting for me. But, is it a safe place? Safe, would have been letting me shoot myself right here. "I?m tired of searching, I will find some place. I?m badly hurt, I don't know what to do now. I will wait for you in some place. I?m tired of waiting now, but, all the same, I don't know where to go... " Come to an agreement for my silence? My silence? I don't even know what it is they think I know! You know there was at least half a million in the vice-president's office. You know you took it and nobody is claiming it... And you also know someone was going to call to pick it up later. Perez! Sure, Perez! He'd called before. And I guess you did see him carrying a suitcase occasionally, didn't you? No! No, no. I think I never saw him. Your friend Rodolfo thinks so... He also thinks. He probably thinks you know who Perez is and everything behind his name... Money laundering... You're talking about drug smuggling, illegal sale of weapons... And bribes. Bribes? Yes, bribes paid to mediators involved in dirty transactions in the whole system. The system? You're trying to say that we're now messing up the whole system? Look, I know things are bad, but you don't need to exaggerate! Where the hell do you live? Don't you read the newspapers? Aren't you aware that this kind of business grow, and grow, and... Look, let's try to make things clear. You're talking about politics, while I?m saying that someone wants to kill me! Wouldn't it be better if you understood what kind of a trouble you're in now? But I don't care about politics at all! You bloody piece of shit, damn it! Who the hell is talking about politics, huh?! Who the hell? Am I talking about politics?! The hell with you, damn it! Fuck and fuck... But... How could I be talking about politics, huh?! I?m not talking about politics. I?m talking about the world you're living in. Countries get... devastated... are sold. Many corporations are dividing the whole world among them without... caring much about the people living in it. That man, Perez, may be a drug dealer, but he can also be a businessman... or an agent for the Intelligent Services. This is the way the whole system works, not only drug dealing! I see... you're a Marxist. No, not at old... I?m much older than that branch. Much older than a communist? I?m an anarchist. My God! "...always lost in time and space... " Why did you choose me? It was a bet. A bet? A bet with whom? With you. I bet you wouldn't let me kill myself. You do faint quite often? Never. What was that, then? I?m a bit diabetic and being under pressure doesn't do me any good. Besides, I had forgotten to eat. "...it may be things, never come back to the same place. But anyway, I?ll find a place some day. All the same, I have no real place to go... " What if they recognize us? I took out my gun... always aiming at him, see? But... when he shot at the glass... We have only fifteen seconds left... ...and everybody started running... Tell the assistant to finish with the make-up, please... You can start. In this robbery, in this story, there are several victims. Our news program, the only program to put this on the air, will show all of you a note found by one of our journalists, the very note the thief gave to the young businessman at the bank, before he held him hostage... "This is a simple matter, Give me back the money you stole from me, or I?ll kill myself right here and now. This same entity, eighteen years ago, when it was called Alcazar Bank, though it had the same board of directors, received a deposit, used that money and never returned it to me. I?m already seventy and I wouldn't mind dying now. This is not a robbery, quite the contrary, you owe me fifteen thousand, three hundred, forty-four dollars. Either you give it back, or you'll have to take charge of my dead body and get the carpet cleaned. " Our society is to blame for this pain, and this pain has caused a new one, which is even more unfair... Tell that man to treat my son well. Pedro is not to blame for anything, see? If this bank did something wrong, my dear Pedro is not responsible for that... He's kind of... nice, honest. He's my only son, so please... Look at the picture she gave them! What's wrong with her? If she's not such an idiot! She's scared. You haven't even called her yet. After the ads, we'll go on discussing this case which is already... I can't call her. My telephone is probably tapped! You watch too many movies... Go and call her. Hello, mom. What is it? You're crying, mom? Take it easy, woman... I?m fine. No, Pedro, you're not fine. They've been here... The police? No, it isn't the police. They're even worse... Did they hurt you? No, not me. But they're after you... I don't really know what you did, but I don't care. I trust you. Please, take care. all right, mom. And please... don't come back home. That'd be the best you can do. The bank did not report any robbery, they didn't want to call the police, just for safety of the young hostage. We're very worried about Pedro. I wish he knew that. I wish he understood we believe he's in real danger, he's taking too many risks... This son of a bitch is threatening me on TV! ...a journalist from our team of reporters, who investigated this case from the very moment the robbery was accomplished... We were carrying out a survey about one of the most painful pending debts in Argentina... ...the old-aged. What do we do for our old people? What are we forcing them to do? And watching that white-haired man carrying a gun, seemed to be a terrible answer to our questions. Pedro Javier Mendoza, this young businessman, is victim of another victim, an old man in despair that doesn't want to surrender and is determined to fight, like an untamable horse, against this wild financial system. An 'untamable' fighting against injustice... We'll investigate his accusation deep further. Meanwhile, there's a young man in danger... We go on with the news... That's it! We have to make this clear... Make clear what? That I?m not your hostage. So, are you my accomplice then? No, you heard it! Nobody talks about the robbery! Who the hell cares about fifteen thousand and some hundreds? We must tell them that I?ve been your sort of shield... We have to appear on TV. Explain to everyone that I sympathized in a way with your claim... On TV? Who's going to believe us? Come on, a young businessman sympathizing with an old chap like me? Oh! You believed it, or am I wrong there? It isn't easy to make people appearing on TV... disappear with a bullet in their heads all of a sudden. We have to tell them our version of the story so they can be our own shield. Oh, what? Garcia del Campo our shield? You don't like Garcia del Campo, then Martin... something, that guy who found the note. You like that one... or he's not your cup of tea either? Same way you chose me? Didn't you think beforehand what a mess you were getting me involved? The note said fifteen thousand and three... The note said you were going to kill yourself! That was my own risk, my life, not yours! Now, suppose for a while that I was so scared that I?d let you kill yourself, I would have felt guilty for the rest of my life!! Hey! Wait, boy! I really don't care about the feelings of people that think money is worth more than life itself! -Than any life! -Sure. Your famous bet, huh? You think you have any right? You think you have the right to decide?! What did I do? You made your own decision. Yeah, with a gun in front of me! The gun was aiming at me, nobody else but me. Understand it or not! Has anyone done this to you before, or is it just another smart anarchist idea of yours? Was it that important to get that money back? Or was it... how can I put it into words? Was it just a social achievement? I needed the money... for something really important to me, and nobody else but me... But nothing is more important than your life. No! I didn't want this, boy. Well, here we are already... And we are there too. How will we defend ourselves? Are you serious when you say you want to appear on TV? Television does exist. I?m fed up with old chaps saying that old past times were better! It exists! And we have to use it! Tell me, haven't you used a gun in the other way around to convince me? Martin, there's a call for you. Take it there. He says he's Pedro Mendoza. Hello? This is Martin Juarez. You read the note. The guy was going to kill himself with the gun. How could I let him kill himself or get killed by the police? And least for that amount of money! He didn't prompt me to do anything. I was just his shield, see? And it was my own decision. so, I want you to tell everyone that I?m all right and that this man is not a criminal. If you want you can record what I?m saying, maybe you're doing it already? No, we aren't recording anything. Pedro, I?m Garcia del Campo. Recognize my voice? Garcia del Campo! I?ve never heard yours. How can we know you are who you say you are? You want to tell this same thing to the audience? Where are you now? I can send Martin over with a camera. I have to discuss it. We must look up in the files of Alcazar Bank... the ones from eighteen years ago, nineteen seventy-seven, huh? Maybe we can find something to help us get the name of the guy. Shall we look in all deposits done for fifteen thousand? No, darling. We'd have to estimate the original deposit less interests accrued after all these years. Tell Alan to do it, and tell him I want it right now. What shall I tell the reporters? They'll surely go on with this tomorrow. Keep on crying for them. I won't talk to them myself. Okay. Moni... Beg them to give you any kind of information about Pedro, right? We have to be the first ones to know if he appears safe and sound. I don't even know your name. Jose. Jose? Jose and Pedro. Sounds religious, doesn't it? And what do you do for a living when you're not betting your own life around? Guess... I think I can't... Aren't you going to tell me? Not now. Aren't you going to tell me where we're heading for either? To the mountains, to Trevelin, a small town twenty kilometers away from the border line. Why would we go to the frontier? You think I?ll become a sort of a "Fugitive"? You're an only child? Hmm! My mother's only child. Dr. Mendoza has four more, but... they're all women. Have a girlfriend? Girlfriend... A girlfriend for real? Someone you love and who loves you... No, I don't have anyone... What about you? Have a wife... children? I used to have... all that. Forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight... Forty-eight. Four hundred and eighty thousands. What will you do with that money?. Give it back. To whom? How should I know? You're the one who thinks smart things here! Why don't you tell me to whom?... This is yours. 15 thousand 344 dollars! It will have to be fifteen thousand four hundred because there's no change... I wonder what my mates at the bank would be thinking, huh? They'll trust Rodolfo, surely. And that's obvious, I'd have done the same... What about the others? My club mates? And the university mates? The doorman... What will Lucia think about it? What would she say?. One never knows... With women, one never knows, is that so? And Dr. Mendoza, what could he be thinking, dear Dr. Mendoza? Who the hell cares what Dr. Mendoza could possibly say, huh? Who's that? My father. No, it doesn't matter. He's a piece of shit anyway. I?m serious. I doesn't matter. Though there are other people that I do care about. People that know me better, people that... What if I never come to see them again? What if this little Pedro here never comes back? What if the door has closed and I am left outside? And if everything collapses now? I?m in real trouble, huh? I am! I don't give a damn if it was a lie... I just don't give a damn if the system is as corrupt as you say or whoever says so! I don't give a damn if you're right and they're wrong! I don't care a shit, damn it! It was my life the one you aimed at with the gun, and it was a good one until you showed up! What if I?ve lost everything for your sake?! Now what? Come on, tell me, how could I be sure you're not a fucking crazy man?! I?ve already told you... sure I would have been killed there. Maybe I am a bit crazy... maybe... But if it helps you... I?m not fucking crazy. My father was the city type. He never wanted to get away from Buenos Aires. That's why we didn't see much of him... I couldn't stand the noise and silence drove him mad. But he was proud of his grandson, and before he died, he sold everything he had and put all the money in that bank so that his grandson could go to study at a university in Buenos Aires... Pablo could never used it. He was seventeen when we were told he had been killed. And everything began to die slowly with our son's death... TUESDAY, 8:00 AM "When will this God above turn things upside down. When are the Poor going to eat bread and the Rich, shit, shit... ". Breathe! Breathe! Hey, I am breathing! Look at the landscape and breathe! Deep inside!... You feel it? This is the way the world smells outside big cities! Do you know who rents video cameras around here? It?s for a birthday party... Of course. Rogelio, he's the one that video-films all parties right here. There, in the house in front. Thanks. For a birthday party?. You said it three times already! You don't have to shout. Do you always charge your customers before they've finished? If you can't pay, you should have said it beforehand. When you're a beggar, you have no right to shout. Drink all of it, for all I care. Son of a bitch! And she even gets offended. She would have asked. Poor and vain, she won't go anywhere. Remember, as I told you, you bring this device here, press this button, look through this window and then, when you want to make another shot, you only have to press right here... all right, all right. I know how it works. Thanks a... I?m just trying to be helpful. As I said, I can go with you and do it myself, see? No, no, no. Thanks, anyway, huh? I?ll bring it back in a while, okay?. See you then. Well, that's fine... You work on TV, don't you? -Me? -Yes. Oh, come on. I?m a financial agent, what TV you're talking about? Can you come over here? I need you to bring into focus the right angle. What are you doing? So they won't recognize the place. You certainly watch too many movies, huh? I think it's just the other way around. That's a perfect disguise. No, sir. Mine is a question of experience. Experience? Don't tell me you're in fact an actor? A man can trust or not. That's up to him, because it's his own life he's taking chances for. His faith, his disbelief, his love, intelligence... And there's no other truth in this world for the human soul than this humble and wonderful condition. Man risks his own life each time he makes a decision, and that makes him free! Maximo Gorki... "The Lower Depths"... by the dramatic cast of the South. What? Then... you are an actor, really?. No, not really. But before being a seventy-year-old chap, long before that, I was a young man... Have you come up with something for the video? Start now! No, you begin!... I mean, what would I say first? Oh! I see, our financial agent has comeback, huh? It?s an excellent camera, see? Here you are, your five hundred dollars for the guarantee, Mr. Mendoza. I wish I could explain it to you. Of course, sure. Explain it to me. But I don't have much time, really. Oh, no, please. I?m so sorry. But you know, nothing really happens in this town! Is it true that guy holds you hostage? No! I knew that! A man that writes such a note... You're helping him escape, aren't you? Kind of. And where are you planning to send that tape to? -To Buenos Aires, where... -I see. ... is the post office here? No, please. How would you send it by mall? It won't be in time for the news program. I mean, I think you want to send it to the TV channel, huh? -Yes. -Leave it to me. I can give it to Norberto, he's about to leave in his truck. Oh, thanks a lot. Frankly, thanks a lot. Look at yourself in the paper. See how handsome you look there! What are you doing, man? Septuagenarian, what a fucking word, huh?... Isn't there any WC in this damned car? You better stop by the road. You pee every now and then, right? Every now and then. Hey! Hey! The car! The car! Fuck it!... No! Hey! Hey! They are going to dredge the river! To look for the money?. No, to look for your dead body... To find... I mean, they'd think I killed you... "We can't say where we are. I want everyone to know that I am not nor have I ever been a hostage. This man was aiming his gun at his own head. I became his shield because I believed and still believe in his reasons. You had the chance to read his note, too. How could I possibly let him kill himself? Or get killed by the police? And as long as the Justice is investigating his accusation, I don't feel like belonging to that bank any more, a bank which surely has stolen money from many others like him!" This young man is not to be held responsible for my actions. His generosity and good-will prompted him to help me. I'd have never done what I did, if I?d known I was getting someone like him involved in this. I want that to be clear. However, I?m not regretful at all, because that entity is just a disguise for illegal transactions." I?ve been investigating and so far, it seems to be true. At least, eighty per cent of the members of the board belonged to the board of directors of Alcazar Bank. Stop investigating that about the board... Let's make that girl investigate the company, the blonde one... -Laura. -That's it, Laura. And as soon as we get more concrete material, we'll let the bomb blow up... Now we have to put it on air raw, as it is. -With the answer from the Bank, for sure. -Consider it done. Oh, you and your favored dwarf. What was its name? -Saverio? -You and Saverio, to the South. With all the information you might get from the truck driver, you have to find these crazy men no matter what. I have many years in this, but I tell you... this couple of 'untamable' ones, by the way a very good name, with these untamable men, people will go crazy, really crazy, huh? If deposit was made in January, nineteen seventy-seven, in historical currency it would amount to three thousand and seven hundred. Quickly, tell me all you found. Well, it isn't the same January or December, because, and above all, we don't know, apparently... I understand that, and I don't care. Tell me, how many did you find throughout the whole year? Names? Any detall? Three... The first is dead, the second is a woman, for whom we have no current details... and the third, he seems to have filed a legal suit. Search for that man. "Look for me where the sun goes down, wherever there's a song playing. Look for me down the seashore, kissing the foam and tasting the salt. Look for me, and you'll find me, in the country of freedom, in the country of freedom... " Open up! Come on, open it! "Contribute with the popular stew. Sign the petition of workers from Santiago that fight for their rights. Don't let them kick us out from our native town." I?m sorry. I made a mistake. This is not mine and I don't want it... It?s you! The one in the picture! I saw your picture on TV! It was you... It?s all your fault! What shall I do now? Tell me, what? If you don't get your hands off me, I?ll shout! Shout as much as you want! Shout, for all I care! And to make it worse, we're far away from the frontier. And now we've lost the bus, and you're to blame! Fucking thief! Don't you call me fucking thief again! Son of a bitch! She was stealing your bag! Even the Bible says that you can rob another thief of his possessions! And now? What will we do with her? We can shoot her in the head... and bury down there, in the middle of this big field, or drop her into deep water with a heavy stone tied to her feet. -Very funny. -Nothing! It?s she who has to make up her mind, not us!... There're no more buses till tomorrow!... We should find a place where to sleep in. What are you going to do now, huh? Hey! What's her name? Girl!... Come over here. Have a nice trip. Have you seen what the father looks like? -Good afternoon... -Hello... His father looks like him, see? But he seems to have less blood, as if he were made of metal, a piece of shit. You are become his friend. Of whom? Smoking or non-smoking area? Of whom? The Mendoza guy. Poor guy, it would be great to become his friend, huh?... Don't take me wrong, I?m a good professional, right? Departure is at 7:00 PM, gate eight. Take your ticket, you "professional". "The closing up of Petromaq, leaves five hundred families unemployed. Why don't you go find out how much is a room? Wait, huh? I won't sleep with both of you... With neither of us, girl, right? His father is an economist. Margarita Lamadrid, his mother, took part in the eighties of many Human Rights Demonstrations. Pedro always lived with her. We don't have any other thing, but this could be a hint... We couldn't identify his accomplice yet, but it's obvious that there are more people involved. The important thing now is to get to know how much they do know, so as to see if they can really get us into... I accept my mistakes: First, I shouldn't have trusted Mendoza; second, I shouldn't have underestimated this episode, thinking that they only wanted the money; and third, I should have managed the press before this turned into such a mess. But now we have the opportunity of using an strategy that closes them in and we have good contacts to do that... the media... I do accept the suggestion of sending specialized people right now to find the place where they are hiding, and I?d like to meet them, if possible, right tonight. "...because that entity is just a disguise for illegal transactions"... Great, genius! We got this surprising material a few hours ago. Pedro Mendoza is no longer a hostage and he says he does not want to go on being an executive businessman either. We also wanted to know his father's opinion. -No, no. -I know very well my eldest son... What the hell do you know? You, son of a bitch! ... because his mother and I got divorced when he was four... -may be five years old... -Six, I was six, six! -He doesn't even know that! -...we've always been in contact. Pedro inherited my passion for Economy... I hate Economy, figures and all that...! ...and I know that he has a very promising future in front of him. I am sure that there is something dirty behind this episode, I am sure my son is not saying the things you're telling me, may be he was drugged, you know?... -I don't know what to think... -I can't believe it! ...Pedro, if you are listening to me.: Your father does not judge you, I know you will explain all this to us... -You are a real son of a bitch! -There's somebody else who thinks... that there is another explanation for Pedro Mendoza's behavior... Thank you Enrique. Pedro is now twenty-three years old, but we know him since he was a teenager. It?s obvious he has been cheated on him by someone who is undoubtedly using him. The bank, Enrique, well, his mates... we all think in the terrible way his life is in danger and we want to ask the whole community to help us to save him. Anyone who can help us to help Pedro will be given a fifteen thousand dollars reward... that's all. Today there were no changes in the markets... But, this creep bets on the worst things in people!!... And you say this thing was your friend? One of you both is a big jerk, don't you think so? Both of us, both! We both made a mistake! Let's go and strike back! Who is it? The police. Very funny. Not as much as you on TV... I need money. You need fifteen thousand? Why don't you go to the fucking hell?... I can manage with ten dollars by now. It was then when they gave me the video tape. Where were they going? Oh, no. Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. ?ll right. Cut. You called them the "untamable", Martin, huh? -That was wonderful! -Fine. -You're an excellent reporter, know? -Well, thanks, thanks... Now the camera is turned off, just for me, you see I?m trying to help them both. Where did they go? Oh, no, no, no. What have they done to you? Let me look at you, baby! All right, your turn now. Just what I needed right now. At least you should cut your bear a bit, see? If I were you, I wouldn't even try. Are you planning to keep on traveling by bus? You better not worry about us. It'd be better if you don't know more than you already know by now. I know what's best for me, not you! Look, we're running away from the police and my head is worth a lot, baby. And now the price will surely go up, huh? But it's too expensive, if you mind my opinion. We aren't interested in your opinion. Thanks for the hair. Now... wouldn't you like to go to sleep? You certainly need me... They're after two, not three. Yeah! Thanks, anyway, all right? You both need me! She wants a share of the money. She thinks she deserves it. "Contribute with the popular stew... " Well, let's make a plan, step by step, huh? First thing, a key name:... "Cerros Azules Phase"? You watch too many movies!... Well, let's see. We'll need... a board box, strong one if possible, like those where biscuits are packed... an alarm clock and a roll of thin rope or cord... Have you eaten something?... Please don't faint while doing that, huh? I ate. Shut up. Who is it? -Police. -I?ll kill her. We have a car already. Listen, girl...! My name is Ana. Mind you, we're not thieves, see? Although that's what in fact seems. -You are not? -No. -And you better not... -Don't start with that again, please. We didn't meet at a convent, remember? We met when you tried to steal from us. Something you had stolen already. We'll have to explain it to her. What is it? Who's there? Who's making such a noise?!... What is it? Who's making such a terrible noise out there? Hey! What are you doing? Who are you? Get out!! WEDNESDAY 6:30 HS. Yes! Have they dredged it? It?s already five minutes to ten. We're in Cerros Azules, in Petromaq facility. As you can see, the whole town has gathered here. The police as well as the judge in charge, received a warning today saying that in this same place, where dismissed employees from Petromaq have been going on strike for twenty- seven days now, and where a popular stew will take place in request of the re-opening of the company, it would be delivered a box containing some new pieces of evidence related to the Untamable Couple. Two minutes now to the fixed time. You call me Untamable. The day I went into the bank to steal what they had stolen from me, in a drawer from the bank vice-president's desk, there was a heap of four hundred and eighty thousand dollars. Young Mendoza, confused as he was, put all the money in my sack. But the bank never admitted having lost that amount. Ask them why?. Ask them what that money was doing in a drawer?... Honorable Judge, journalists, people from Cerros Azules... Here's the proof! Here's the money! We're giving back to you four hundred sixty-four thousand and six hundred dollars that are not ours, and we never really wanted! In the name of the many cheated on people of our country... enjoy yourselves! There we go! "... Let me go through the wind without papers. l'd do it for the time we lived. Because there's no other way out. Because you seem to be asleep. Because I would spent all my life looking for your smile. I want to be the only one to bite your lips... " "... I want to be sure life won't finish after you. Because I feel it, I feel it, I feel it. Because I don't want to Live a single day without you by my side, because I feel it, I feel it, I feel... " Then you call Ingeniero Huergo, Villa Regina and General Roca... Remember, a boy and an old chap. They're driving a black Escort Cabriolet. You know what you have to say, right? I?ll go on making telephone calls. Thanks. They didn't appear in La Aguada either. Well, they're probably sleeping in the car. But they surely have to put gas in the car... Rio Colorado Station... Yes. Cerros Azules! They've been there?... How could I call you if you're so near!... What? They did what? How much? They made it rain at least half million dollars? What?! Repeat that! And the police? They're fantastic, brother. -Just great...!! -We must put them on the alert! Tell them as soon as possible those guys are after them! Young, talented, independent, good at figures, according to his father; a generous young man, according to his mother; a good buddy, according to his colleagues... Listen to this: an excellent tennis player, ambitious and good-looking. What made this young yuppie become the protective shield, the ally of a desperate old man, according to the Law, to whom the people have started to call The Untamable? This is certainly flattering. This is good for us. Why didn't you buy some more? You could sell them with your signature on the way?. You're all that? More or less. He has to be crazy. He must be completely nuts! Then, both of them. No, the old chap was crazy long before this... But the boy?. Can you see what he did? Half million dollars blowing off in the air... Like in movies, or better. That's what it seemed! He behaves as if he were shooting a movie and he was given the main role. And you're the director of the movie? They don't look like tourists, huh? They know everything. They must be planning a financial or political move or both of them together and we don't know how far they might get. Then, as things are getting too complicated, I think we have to make them disappear, the sooner the better, no matter what. "When would this God above turn things upside down. When would this God above turn things upside down. ...turn things upside down. Let the Poor eat bread and the Rich shit, eat shit, shit... Turn things upside down. Let the Poor eat bread and the Rich eat shit, shit, shit. Let the Poor eat bread and the Rich eat shit, shit. Let the Poor eat bread and the Rich eat shit, shit. Castillo! Castillo, why didn't you report anything about all the money stolen? We know nothing, as we already said, about the origin of that money. Which is your answer to the Untamable's accusation, Castillo? The Untamable... We have nothing to do with that and I repeat, we do trust in Justice to solve all this matter. Castillo, can you describe the situation in Cerros Azules... ? No, no, no. I can't make any statement now, please! Where did that money come from? Come on, does any of you really think we were keeping half million dollars in a drawer?! Oh, please, that's not serious! The cops! The cops are coming! Stay quiet. Hello? Hello, good morning! You need help? A new car rather, see? Well, bye-bye, huh? See you later! He recognized us. I?m not sure. It?s them. The Untamable Couple. -Take your gun out. Hurry! -Don't bother, buddy. They gave away half million dollars. Do we always have to be the bad guys in the movie? Let the Federal Police look for them if they want. Get into the car. Let's go and have something to eat. If you are ready to spend your whole life roaming around in this old car, that's your business, but I won't! I?m sorry, guys, huh? I must go on with my trip. I hope you don't mind, friend... Get your arms up, huh? Come on, come on, come on! Just out of curiosity... You're the famous Untamable Couple, aren't you? Take your gun out! Just with two fingers, huh? Easy, easy... Drop it there, throw it! Now yours, come on! Come on! Come here. Pick them up. You too. Come on! Son of a bitch! Stay there! Don't move! Want me to shoot you in the head? You want me to do that, huh? Are you okay?. Yes! Pick up the guns! Throw everything away! Come on, hurry up! Come on! I told you! If you had taken your gun our instead of arguing! Keep your arms up! Hear me? Don't you dare get them down! We'll soon got you. And you'll learn never to mess around with police officers again!! Hurry up, get into the car! Shoot, you fucking old chap! Shoot! You will regret having... Get in, damn it! Shoot them! Shoot! You won't go anywhere in that old thing! You! I want to see your arms up! Come on! We'll catch you soon!! Awesome!!! I didn't have any bullets! Hey! What are you doing? Hey! The only one I had, I used it by accident at the bank! "... from the south, from this side of the planet where there's more water than earth, more hunger than tiredness, more future than past times. " "Well, It?s half past seven, time to read the news, although I don't feel like it, see? We have so much bad news... Don't you feel that, in spite of the news, we know less and less about reality at times?" Hello. Hello. I can never open this. You've got two rooms? You're The Untamable, aren't you? No! You can't possibly know my uncle Salvador. He's never been to the South. You can't stay here. There're some guys chasing you... and they are the kind that like beating up people. You should take another road, see? Thanks. Carrasco. Thanks, Carrasco. No, no, please. I won't charge you... I?m sorry I can't put you up here, but... It?s dangerous for you too. Besides, I guess you know there's a reward and there's always an idiot trying to win it, see?... Hold on a second! Beba!! The kind of buddies that Iike beating up people... Come on. It?s meat. And it's still warm. And this for the cold, huh? How did you know we were coming? all people from Service Stations are on the alert... Well, good luck, friends! -Thanks a lot. -And be careful. Thank you very much. They had guns. -Both of them? -The woman too. A woman? You mean, the old chap, Mendoza and a woman? Who is she? A prostitute. What kind of guns did they have? Ordinary and a thirty-eight. And now they have our guns too. Are you sure Mendoza was carrying a gun too? You think he had a Lollipop and we got confused? No, I?m sorry. It?s just that so far, things were different... There was no violence at all and... Look, kid. Don't be mistaken. These guys are very dangerous! The old chap especially. But the boy too. And your wife... ...what is she like? She died. Fifteen years ago. Oh! What was she like? Her name was Clara and she was dazzling. And who are you? How did you come up with something like this? Like a robbery but the other way around, huh? You were confident they wouldn't say: 'Oh, kill yourself old chap, who cares? I didn't know. What would you have done? How should I know? He would have killed himself. Actually?. Who's this old man? I don't know. And you? Me what? What was it? What got into you? You know him well now, but at that moment... You saved his life, but he screwed up yours, didn't he? A guy like you... What am I like? That the paper said about you. From the south. Today I feel it is possible, don't you think so? sometimes one hears things that make one believe... it's possible to do something even now, that we still can do things. Well, let's talk about it later. Now messages from the audience... First.: for Nora, come back home! Ricardo says you can start it all over... second.: for Matias from Malacara.: Ponce says that the truck is ready now and that he'll send it back tomorrow. The third one is not so private. For The Untamable... listen friends, try to avoid Road Number Three and remember the chain of solidarity is getting larger and larger to help you. You're welcomed, you deserve it. Take care... ...And now from the south and for The Untamable that made us realize that we still can fight for our beliefs... Come! Come on! Come on, you too. Damn it! Life is certainly worth living!! The important aspect of this case is the example given. Society can once more start musing about their rights in a different way this time. These people are crazy. What do they want? Old people to start threatening with killing ourselves? Want us to rob banks from now on? The boy was great! I don't know if I?d have had the courage. I really admire him for what he did. May be rich people learn to respect people a little more, huh? And to steal less from us. Look what they've done! Most people don't even remember this started with a robbery. You mean the old chap's or the bank executives'? Forget about the old man being cheated on and the young heroic businessman. This is not what it seems. They're taking advantage of us, you know? This happened twice in my life, only twice. And I don't want this to be the third, see? Nobody gives half million away just because. And they won't use me this freely, huh? I like that girl. I like women who don't ask for permission to lead their own lives. Where could she come from? You are the kind that likes tango, aren't you? Me? You care too much about women's past. She said it. We didn't meet for the first time in a convent. Neither did we... We have to split up. Not even mad! Look, this is not a game, boy. Realize that? They're after us and not only the police, see?... Getting apart would be the most reasonable way. I only have time till tomorrow, and you have to reach the border line... I have the necessary money. We can divide it in equal parts and... That's your money!... and you needed it to do something. Yes, but I don't care about that now. Things have changed. You were about to kill yourself for an unimportant reason?! I only care about you both, now. -What we have to do is get another car. -Listen... You and me are partners... The Untamable Couple won't give up! I told you... my son was named Pablo, didn't l? I think I haven't thanked you yet... You didn't let me kill myself after all. A toast to you, partner! some years ago, in USA, an incredible series of suicides took place in public. Men and women, due to various different reasons, killed themselves in front of large TV audiences. This horror ended the day a responsible journalist asked the cameraman to turn off the camera because a suicidal wanted to kill himself on the air. He said: "you may kill yourself for all I care, but let me tell you that you're not going to appear on the eight o'clock news. "It?s high time to let The Untamable, as they are called, know that statements from their victims as well as decisions from competent authorities are much more important to our cameras than their suspicious exploits, because that's what ethics demands for responsible journalist. Things have changed now? Things have changed, Martin... Understand? Have changed! Wait, wait, wait. What will you do now? I?ll blow the horn to call their attention. Can't you see they're eating? So what? Will we wait until they've finished? We will. Hello, friends? Hello. Enjoy your meal! -Thanks, thanks. -Could you... You need gas? Yes, but we're not in a hurry. Don't let it get cool. We'll go to the toilet meanwhile... How delicious smell! Come nearer. Want to eat some meat? Sure, brother. There's enough for everyone. Let the girl sit down. There's enough for everyone. Isn't it true guys that there's enough for all of us? Even if there wasn't! How could we not share our meal with The Untamable? Sit down. Come on, come over here... I knew it! I knew I was going to find you eventually! But... The radio said you were around Camarones City?. Don't be a beast, huh! Excuse me, madam. Excuse me. I didn't mean to be rude, see? Sorry, but, er... May I shake hands with you? A toast! To old guys that have big balls and young men that... also have big balls! Cheers! Cheers, buddy! Cheers, cheers! The meat looks tasty, huh? Chief, you want some of this well-done part? Are you sure you didn't eat all of eat, fatty friend? There're ribs. You like ribs too? I like just anything. Hey, Nestor! Now that you've got them in front, why don't you ask them that question? You're embarrassed to repeat it? God, you do like gossiping, huh? You look like old spinsters from town. Our friends here mock at me because I don't really believe much in your story. We are two, now. The same guy who threatens to kill himself if they don't return him fifteen thousand dollars then gives away five hundred, quite strange, isn't it?... ...at least I think so... The fifteen thousand had been robbed to my family, the five hundred thousand were robbed who knows to whom... so... Yeah, and it was surely only a little confusion, when you opened the drawer you... only wanted to take out fifteen thousand, but unwillingly, you took out the rest by accident... But, if we had wanted to steal that money, why would we return it then? And if you didn't want to steal it, what did you take it for? -Are you a cop?! -Hey! Sit down, right. Sit down. Hey, man... you're being disrespectful... Why? Because I say I don't understand too much what they want to sell us, huh? Because of that? You're not talking about us, you're taking about what you saw on TV. The TV branded us, TV has to sell, you know, cars, candies, everything. Today, they speak about us and tomorrow, about any other thing. But we aren't selling anything... That sounds good and we could even believe it, but while you try to get your money back and give away the part you don't need, a guy in Rio Colorado was hit in the head... -Wait, wait, wait... who got his head broken? -What's wrong with you? all of a sudden you became a jerk? The ones to blame for what happened to that guy are... those sons of bitches who are following them, not they! Well, some people like to become heroes, not me. Hey, you, the telephone is ringing! Excuse me... Are you going far away?. No, no, no! You have to drive. Yes, partner, yes... Friends... kind friends that we met on the road... Oh, my God... ... I?d like to make a toast to your honor... A toast! Cheers, friend! Great, friend! But wait, besides... I want to have a toast to the man who let me meet you... He made a bet with me and he thinks he won, but I am the one who won it... I told you... not to get drunk!, he's a boy... Hey! They are near here! They were calling us and we didn't hear the phone... Oh, those fucking men, let's go! Let's go! Quickly, let's go!... Take the first detour on the left. It?s a fucking path, but you'll find a garage after twenty-five kilometers, ask for Esteban there! A car is coming, they must be them! They are close, let's go! Let's make a kind of wall! You, Hugo, stay behind! You, come with me! Hurry up, men, we won't be able to stop them for too long! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Don't let them get through! Watch out!! Ouch!, Bloody sons of a bitch, they are firing at us! They are coming, look at this! You can leave it at the end of the valley, right? On the road to Molino Viejo, on the bend!... Could you please stop that fucking noise?!... I don't want you to waste time, you leave the car and go away, OK? Yes, you already told me that. -We are leaving. -Just a minute, I?m coming. The Jeep is from town 'Cerros Azules', we borrowed it, two hundred dollars in payment of the use we made of it... "The Untamable" Bye man. Thank you very much for everything, huh?... Bye, man. Thank you. Bye, bye, kid. Good luck. Thank you very much, right? Let's go! There are no mistakes, we already checked everything three times. There is one big mistake, everything's been wrong, from the very beginning... he didn't calculate any interests... he's the kind of guy who... he made no calculations! We must look up for the amount he asked in the note, fifteen thousand three hundred and forty-four, that's the original amount deposited with no interests at all... My God! They are two fucking idiots, only that, two fucking idiots... Fucking old guy! We have to go to Trevelin first, but leave us wherever you can, we'll manage. You're not thinking to go by car across any police post, are you? No. I?ll drive you along paths free of policemen. You are in good hands, nobody knows these paths better than me. I cross these mountains all the time... I?m a smuggler.. I already knew you when I saw you in that bus... Me? I had seen you, that morning in Rio Colorado. I am not what the newspaper said. I had already realized. -Where did you come from...? -That toast was great you know? Why are you alone? What do you want to know? My surname? Where I was born? Or what you really want to know is the number?... How many guys I slept with? ... I could tell you that with anyone, it would almost be the truth. I had never before met a man not included in the scale that goes from microbe to gorilla. In general, most of them were cockroaches... And I know that... tomorrow, may be the day after, I?ll wake up and you will have disappeared, but I don't care... Nobody is going to disappear, Ana Those are not cops! The are private pigs... The thing is getting serious! "A growing violent situation surrounds each time more that old man, who some ones call "The Untamable" and his hostage, now his alley, Pedro Javier Mendoza..." "Undoubtedly, this story is changing its way. We are in Chubut, close to Road 26, 12 kilometers away from Manantiales, the nearest town. This place has been burned only three hours ago. Its owner, Jaime Salcedo, was taken to hospital with many wounds in his head. A couple of hours before the fire, "The Untamable", together with an unknown girl we already know has joined them, had stopped right here..." You really think they burned this place? No, I don't think so. But they did something. Something, yes, sure they did something... You changed the movie, "Director"? Don't bother me! You heard what policemen said, that now they carry weapons! I only believe what I do see. They'll cut off our allowance, we must go back. This is my story! I started it and I am going to finish it! Garcia del Campo, besides your allowance is going to cut off your balls! If I find them, you know how much l will care about Garcia del Campo? Everything's all right, we are leaving. -Who is that guy talking with? -Who? Hi... Get down... Down! Down!... It seems that the taming of the Untamable will start right here, get down! We are from the News, Channel 5 from Buenos Aires! Drop that camera! Drop it or I?ll make your head blow!... What are you waiting for? Take it out from him! Ow! Bloody sons of a bitch! What if I burn you, huh? I am sure you won't dare throw that match, you old chicken! Want to bet? What happened? Nothing, nothing, nothing... it just grazed me, nothing else. There is a first-aid kit in the van. Let's see, let me see... Let me see. Is he all right? He's all right, all right. The bullet grazed him, just a scratch, nothing else. Pedro, at last we met, I am Martin!... You really went ahead in a wonderful way! You and... what's the name of your partner? -Untamable, don't you know it? -And the girl? She's not part of it... Leave her alone, leave her alone! -Stop shooting! Stop it! -But we are here to help you, brother. We went out to help you with those guys! Well, all right, thank you very much. Now could you stop recording, I told you, huh? Stop fucking around, go! It?s getting late, what shall we do with these two? What can we do? -Which one is your car? -The green one. If you do it again you'll loose your knee! Pedro, how did you get involved in this, a guy like you, why?. Because of a bet. Fucking whore! This is almost over for you, you dirty bitch! I?ll shove that gun up your ass! Take your clothes off, sweet mouth... And start before I starting counting one. "When would this God above turn things upside down. When would this God above turn things upside down... They are calling you, it must be your boss, right? "Men?ndez, you hear me? Men?ndez, you should have called two hours ago, where are you? Rodolfo? Peter?... is that you?... Listen, we still have time... Son of a bitch!... You, fucking son of a bitch! You don't understand that it's you who is sending me to hell?! I know you are a jerk, but if you want me to calm down you must help me! You're sending pieces of trash to kill me! To find you! To find you... you're going to end up with a shot in your forehead and, what for? Give the old guy in, Peter. My name is Pedro! You want to bet?... Let's bet who dies first and in the worst way! Don't hung up! Don't... hung up. Who the hell knocks at this hour! Surprise! You, son of a bitch! Shhh, there are ladies here. Oh, you even bring ladies, you creep! What? Anyone else? Not for now. No! But if I haven't asked you anything yet! Let's save time. No!... Where are my glasses? How are you?... -What happened? -Nothing, nothing. Why don't you congratulate him too? Eusebio, behave yourself... I?ll bring you some cups of coffee. Behave yourself. Even if you hadn't stolen the money, it wouldn't be enough for you. I don't want the house. -It?s not enough anyway. -I don't want the land. I should have guessed that... Where are you going to put them? That's my business, you know well why I told you to wait until Thursday. Today is Friday. -Why don't you go to hell a bit? -Look after your vocabulary, huh? You received the order to sell them and you have to sell in the most convenient way for the owners and, right now, I am willing to pay you more. Any good lawyer would reject my offer. Our children always leave all their mountain clothes. There are too many, they never tidy them up... Neither do l... I start missing them and I may start crying looking at a scarf... Isn't this Jos?? Yes. That's the four of us, before getting married. Was this his wife? Clara, she was my sister. You resemble her. And, what did Jose do? Where did he work when he was young? He's always done the same... until a month ago when the owners put everything on sale and... Didn't he tell you? He'll tell you soon... He likes to do things his own way... You are...? You can manage by yourselves, take this! Take everything you need. You've seen how young they were? Be careful. Why?. I will believe anything you say. I am not a cockroach, Ana. No, you're not a cockroach. I really don't understand you, fucking idiot, if that was what you wanted, why didn't you take it with you directly?. That would have been a theft. And this thing you did, how is it called? That money belonged to me Eusebio, they are the thieves, they are the ones who steal money from thousands of poor idiots everyday. Save the speech, Jos?... Now you like to speak a lot... You gave place to a lay miracle over there... When your voice was heard while those dollars fell down like rain, you looked like a preacher, exactly like those ones who speak... on TV... Why don't you go to the fucking hell? How obscene! -You can't be arguing, are you? -No. What do you want? To make a party?. I was dreaming with Clara when you woke us up. Let's see, tell me. Very good, now let's tell our dreams. We were little girls... and were playing near the river... ...we laughed and then... we held each other and Looked at ourselves in the water... and the image did not reflect our girls' faces... we were old... very old, much more than we are now... but we were together... We'll be together again. Not long ago... I dreamed of the day we met, the four of us.... And then she had a bad dream! I was kidding, Natalia. Sometimes I think you did wrong when you introduced him to me... Your friend is turning into a horrible old man... I was kidding... They never give up... The only two things you did right in your life were to marry Clara and to introduce Natalla to me... Yes, sir Yes, sir... Well, give me that money once and for all. We don't have all the time in the world. Trucks are coming at seven? And you're going to pay their cost! "You know that I went there so that they let me kill myself, it was the only thing I could do to make the attempt to save them. They have always trusted me, since they were born. And they were going to sell them to a meat processing plant, to turn them into mashed meat. Why? They could turn myself into mashed meat too!!... But you changed everything, we started meeting people, and people are there when one goes out to look for them, and I had already forgotten about that... ...l couldn't prevent my son from getting killed, I couldn't help my wife, Clara, not to die out of sadness. They are... well! They were the only important thing left for me. I raised them, it was worthy to risk my Iife to save them, but only mine, but only mine, you understand?... I felt ashamed to tell this to you but, before meeting you, they were the only living things I felt responsible for... It?s all right Jos?, everything's OK. We saved them... and, by the way, you also saved me. Here you have Brumario... He's brave, so you will understand each other... You know how to ride a horse? It doesn't matter, he knows. His name is Germinal, he likes girls... ...let him take you... I hope you find what you are looking for... Good bye Caos, I?ll miss you so much! I?ll miss you a lot Caos!... Take care. His name is Caos, like my first horse. Take care, he will take care of you. What's this, a farewell? Don't get lost again... Don't offer yourself as hostage every now and then. Don't take long. Don't wait for me. Go, damn it! Pedro! Thank you!! There will be no more dry grass... when the frost comes. From now on, when it snows, you won't have a shelter... and nobody is going to remove your thorns, when you put your legs close to dangerous plants! Come!... Nobody is going to set your pace now... nobody is going to show you the way, you will be able to choose, you are free!... Go! Damn it! "You can do something to feel yourself fully alive... ...before being definitely dead... However, I shouldn't die yet, there are so many things I haven't told him, so many ones I had forgotten... But it's good this way, we both won this bet, isn't that right, Pedro?!" Damn it! Life is certainly worth living!
