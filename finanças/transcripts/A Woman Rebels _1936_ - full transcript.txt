You may proceed, Miss Piper. As women, the first thing of importance. Is to be content to be inferior to men. Inferior in mental power in proportion as she is inferior in physical strength. A really sensible woman feels her dependence. She is conscious of her inferiority. Don't cry. - Shush. For women .. - If you please, Miss Piper. I thought you'd learn, Flora, that it is not deemed good manners to interrupt. I'm sure we'll all be very interested to hear your breathtaking news. You may tell us. Speak up, girl. Speak up. Don't sit there snivelling. She didn't speak, father. I did. Really? And what did you say to your sister? I .. told her not to cry. Your solicitude for your sister is very touching. I could find it in my heart to wish you were as considerate of your father. I have never been inconsiderate of you, sir. Do you think it's a pleasure for me to return here to my home .. Where I should find peace on the Sabbath after a hard week in London. Only to be disturbed by the reports of your behaviour during the week. Stand up, girl. I have here Miss Pipe's weekly report. Of the misdemeanours of her charges. As usual it is a very long one. 'On Monday, Miss Pamela did not appear for her painting lesson'. 'On Tuesday, Miss Pamela was discovered in the kitchen'. 'Entertaining the housekeeper and two kitchen maids'. 'With an imitation of the unfortunate stuttering manner of the vicar'. 'On Wednesday Miss Pamela left her bedchamber'. 'After retiring for the night'. 'And surreptitiously descended to the library where she removed two books'. 'Damaging the lock on the bookcase in so doing'. Pamela, is this true? Is this violation of every rule of this house the truth? Answer me, girl. Quite true, father. For your sake, Pamela, I trust you can satisfactorily explain your behaviour. Though I confess I cannot imagine any. I want to know things, father. The only way to learn anything is by reading. Really? Continue, pray. You see, I can't learn worthwhile things from Miss Piper as all she knows is .. Amateurish watercolour painting and needlework and childish piano lessons. And anything that you consider worthwhile in your limitless wisdom .. Can be learned of course only by reading forbidden books? That is just it, father. Why are they forbidden? It's absurd to be treated as if I were a little child without a mind of my own. If the earth moves around the sun why shouldn't I know it? Is it a crime to know that a horse has four legs? Or is it a crime .. - That will do. Serena. When I entrusted my house and my children to your care. I believed that as my sister you were in full knowledge of your responsibilities. I inform you with regret. That my daughters are deliberately ungrateful and disrespectful. Don't talk in plurals, father. Whatever it is that I am accused of I am alone responsible. Flora has nothing to do with it. Come here, girl. Take that book. Take that book. Your thirst for knowledge shall be satisfied. What do you know about the book you have in your hand? The results of your teachings, Miss Piper. Yes, Judge Thistlewaite. Will you inform your pupil what she should know about that book. Mrs Ellis's Daughters Of England is the true guide of every lady. It is the bible English womanhood and every sentence is a holy command. Thank you. You understand that, Pamela? - No. What? - I don't believe it. I believe nothing in that book. It's nonsense. Silence. You have provoked me beyond the bounds of mortal patience, Pamela. You must be punished. You shall go to your room now. Without any supper. - But I am hungry. You remain in your room until you learn by heart the chapter in that book .. Devoted to a daughter's attitude toward her father. When I return here next Sabbath I shall expect you to recite it to me verbatim. That is all. You may go. - But father .. I said, that is all. I should hate to be on trial before you. Either innocent or guilty. If you're unjust as a father you must be equally unjust as a judge. Hungry? - No. I brought you biscuits. They're very good. Thanks. Why did you cry? I couldn't help it, Pam. He frightens me. That's silly. He's human like anyone else. He's only a man. He is our Papa. That makes a difference. Besides, everyone is frightened of him. Not just me. Even you are a little. - I'm not. [ Door knocks ] Quick. That may be him. Well, my pretties. Betty. You startled me. She thought it was Papa. - Him? I've a notion to give him a piece of my mind but I know he'd take it out on you. The idea of sending a growing girl to bed without any supper. There. I won't let you starve. Betty, you're an angel. I am famished. - Of course you are. He should be ashamed of himself treating you like that. But don't you fret your pretty heads. Betty will look after you. I brought you into this world and I will keep you in it. I thought you weren't afraid of him. I'm not. - Oh no? I suppose that's why you jumped so when you heard Betty? I'm not afraid of him. I just don't like him. Pam. He is our father. We couldn't help that, could we. I've been reasoning it out. There isn't a reason children must love their parents whatever they're like. Father is always horrid to us. He never pays any attention to us unless he thinks we've done something wrong. That is just the way Papas are I expect. He has never even kissed us. Not once. You don't know, Pam. Perhaps he did when we were little. - He didn't. I can remember. I can remember everything. I can remember even when mother died. I was five then and you weren't even four. He didn't kiss us then. Did our mother kiss us? Hmm. All the time. Except when he was around. She was afraid of him too. I'm going to have it out with him. Pam, it will only start more trouble. I won't get you into it. But something has got to be done. We can't go on this way any longer. All our lives. Hush, hush, hush. Nobody ever tells us anything. Such a lot of secrecy about nothing. When I marry and have children I shall tell them everything. What will you tell them? I don't know but .. I'll tell them. There won't be any of this hush hush. [ Door knocks ] Just a minute. Come in. Pamela. Flora. I have given much thought to you both. I have decided that you are intolerably spoiled. This ceaseless pleasure. This irresponsibility which you have indulged in will be stopped. You must learn something of the seriousness of life. As soon as possible, I shall arrange to have you introduced into society. It is my desire that without too much waste of time .. I shall be able to select suitable husbands for you. I shall of course expect you to be guided by my selection. In that way. Appropriate marriages can doubtless be arranged. Put out the lights. Pam. We are to make our d?but? We're going to get married and give dinners and have babies .. And go to teas and everything. Yes. But we have a right to pick our own husband. How can we until we meet some men? We can't. But I'm not letting him pick my husband for me. He picked our governess and look what we got. The Piper. I wonder if young men are like Papa. Merciful heavens. Well anyway. We'll have a chance of finding out. I am going to sleep. Here. Ready? - Hmm. I am going to open a window. But the Piper said at night one should never open a window. Hang the Piper. I want the window open. Is this my dance, Flora? Yes, Alan. Yes indeed. You are a very forward young man. Do you mind? No. Now then. Tell me. What rivals have I to dispose of? And a very sure one. Sorry. I am. Have you met Papa? And asked him for permission to call? You misunderstand me. I don't want to call on your Papa. You will give me the next dance? Sorry but I have already promised it. I knew there would be a rival. Perhaps Miss Piper will give you the next dance? Would you .. Would you like an ice, Miss Piper? I would. And then he asked for Papa's consent and Papa agreed. Then he asked me if I would marry him and .. Pam, the whole room when round. The only thing I saw were his eyes looking at me and .. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. I said yes. - You love him? Yes. And Pam. Alan has to leave for Italy in two weeks to rejoin his ship. Papa is prepared to let us be married at once. Papa? Are you sure you love him? - I do. Darling. Be happy. Alan is waiting for me. I shall miss you, Pam. - Me too. I have come to claim my dance. But I told you I have already promised it to someone else. Good. Then we won't dance. You know, this is very rude of you. But you promised to show me the garden. This is the summer house. You are a very strange person. Tell me about yourself Gerald Waring. I? I am what I believe is technically referred to as a black sheep. Good. So am I. You? Well, that's what my family seem to think. Except my sister. So, we are kindred spirits. What does your being a black sheep consist of? Oh. Nothing very exciting I'm afraid. Except. Coming out here when I should be listening to Miss Piper's lectures. That is shocking. You know, I am. I am afraid we are very disreputable characters. Well. They would probably lock me in my room for a month .. If they knew how often I came out here alone after they had all gone to bed. Don't you ever have any fun? This is fun. No. I mean. I mean real fun. Well, yes. My sister Flora and I have jokes together. But she is to be married. And you will be alone. Yes. So we will have fun together. I tell you what you do. Wednesday, I will be in London. So why don't you come up to town on some pretext and we'll have a day of it? We will go to .. We will go to Madame Tussauds. I couldn't. Miss Piper wouldn't go. I did not invite Miss Piper. You mean you want me to go alone? Un-chaperoned? Why not? No reason. I just couldn't. That's all. Ah, rubbish. I'll meet you at Madame Tussauds on Wednesday. The left wing at 2 o'clock. No. No, I couldn't. - The left wing at 2. I beg your pardon but which way is the left wing? You're five minutes late. - If you knew how difficult it's been. The important thing is that you got here. You know, I was so desperate I was on the verge of engaging the beast. That old thing? He's nothing. I defied the Piper. Ah, brave girl. You see, even Romeo kneels in admiration of her courage. He wouldn't if he knew how frightened she really was. Surely not of Romeo? - Of course not. Oh. Of herself perhaps. You see. She has been behaving in a very irrational way. Perhaps that is because of the inconstant moon. No. I mean. Walking through the streets of Verona to meet a young man she doesn't even know. Whom she likes? - She must. Or she wouldn't behave so. Don't go. Please. - No. I must. Don't look over my shoulder. - I am sorry, father. Flora has pleased me very much. I hope the time is not too distant when I can enter your name in a like manner. Yes, father. However, I am very displeased at your lack of interest in my partner's son. Mr Ashley? Father, he is so dull. Dull? He is a very worthy young man with excellent prospects. Young women are not qualified to pass judgment in these matters. As a matter of fact I learned before our marriage your mother considered me dull. When I return next week I shall bring him with me. And I am sure you will not find him dull. Papa. You aren't going to London tonight, are you? It's my practice to return to London when I have early-morning court. I know, but I thought that tonight with Flora gone .. I see no reason why Flora's marriage should disarrange my life. Papa. Please. What is it, girl? Speak up. It's just that it's lonely here tonight. Piper is here. You have Miss Piper. Goodnight. Juliet. Juliet. Here is thy Romeo. Gerald. Pamela. What is it, darling? Everything. Now mind, my dear. I will chaperone you up to London but none of your pranks. Miss Piper is still frightened of the way she lost you that last trip. Isn't it wonderful that she has one of her headaches today. That's the sweet Christian spirit I must say. You will be an angel and do exactly as I say when we get to London? Now, what are you planning? Nothing wrong. I just want you to go to the post office and mail my letter to Flora. And then let me have half an hour to myself. Bless my soul, Miss Pamela. You make me all excited. You are indeed. Who is he? Where did you meet him? On a street in Verona. Verona? Verona? I never heard of such a place. You don't have to tell me this time. I know. I beg your pardon, Miss? Gerald. Pamela. Pamela. - Yes, darling? I did not know until yesterday. What is the matter? What's wrong? I thought his whole matter was settled. But .. What? What are you trying to tell me, Gerald? I was on a .. Drunken spree in Paris and .. Pamela. I am married. Gerald. She found out I'm a nephew of Lord Gaythorne so .. Now she has come to England. You should have told me. - Yes. But I thought I would be free. Pamela. I never loved her. And yet. I imagine that you told her that you loved her. Just as you told me that you loved me. No. No. I did not. That's not true. I will swear I didn't. Pamela. Won't you try and understand? She knows that if there's a scandal my uncle would cut me off. Well, let him. Let him cut me off. I'll make her divorce me. Darling, we will get married. - No, Gerald. You're no more to blame than I. Except. That you knew. I didn't. Buongiorno, Signorina. Buongiorno. - Good morning. I wonder if you realize what a very fortunate young woman you are. You know, most men would dislike having their wife's relatives visit them. But I am really glad that Pamela is coming. Well, you are wonderful. What do you know about it? I am a sailor. Sailors have a girl in every port. Ah yes. But this is the only port you are in. And you're the only girl in it. Pamela, do say something. It fair gives me the shivers the way you just 'sit'. I'll be more cheerful when we get there I promise you. Don't worry about Miss Flora. Women have been having children for .. Well, ever since I can remember. These foreign donkeys do act up. Come on, get him up. We're in a hurry. Fa molto caldo. It is too hot. The donkey, he gets tired. Yes. I know it is hot but we have to get on. In time he will get cold and he will get up. Miss Pamela, don't. You'll get your dress wet. No, Miss Pamela. No, no. There is a man here. Come on you wretched creature. Get up. Don't be so stubborn. Just the nature of the beast. Is there anything I can do? It's just this stupid donkey. I say. You need not have got your clothes all wet. You made a very charming picture. Now that you've been happily entertained, would you mind driving on. I beg your pardon? I didn't realise you were doing that for pleasure. Onward, Giuseppe. - Benissimo, Signore. Get up. Get up. Apparently, this is amusing to you. I regret that it is. There you see. He is cool again. I told you so. Hello Pam. - Hello, Alan. Oh my, this is fun. - Pamela. May we present Thomas Lane. He is to be our guest for the weekend. I believe we have met before. I believe we have. You know, Miss Thistlewaite. Meeting you like this is the unkindest trick fate has ever played on a man. Unkind? - Yes. I spent one solid year of boredom in this deadly country. And now on my last weekend you arrive. You make me hate to go. Why didn't you go into the diplomatic service? I'd like someone to make speeches like that to me. Food pronto, Signore. Everything is ready. Alright. It's very well for you women to sit here chatting about forbidden fruit all day. As for me, duty calls. The weight of empire hangs heavily on my shoulders too. Paris and the embassy await me. I wish you didn't have to go. I wish I didn't too. And how. No tears. It's only .. You have never left me before. It will only be a short cruise. You'll have to get used to it. Leaves are always ending. - I suppose so. You'll take care of ourself, won't you? - Yes, Milord. I will not run. I will not jump. I will not fall down. In fact. I will not do anything except sit in my little garden and await your return. Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. Well. - Goodbye. They have a much nicer word here in Italy. What's that? Arrivederci. Arrivederci. Goodbye, Alan. - Goodbye Pam. Goodbye, Flora. Thanks for the splendid time. Goodbye, Thomas. Please come again. Thank you. Goodbye. Pam. Pam, it is from Alan. Written in Gibraltar three weeks ago. According to his reckoning he'll be home tonight. Oh, Pam. Do you think he'll remember me? There's one from Papa also. And Papa. In his well-known dignified way. Informs us that he considers .. 'Postponement of your return ridiculous, extravagant and unnecessary '. How like Papa. You won't leave me until my baby is born, will you? No, Floss. I won't leave you. What is it, dear? - Nothing. It's just that I am glad that Alan is coming home. Pam. There's something troubling you. Floss. I don't know what I'm going to do. I have to stay here. I have no alternative. It isn't just on your account. It's on mine too. I have wanted to tell you. Mary has been urging me to. I didn't know how. My poor darling. And him. You love him very much? I don't know. I just don't know. Stop your jabbering. I don't understand you anyhow. Miss Flora, I was trying to make a civilised roast for Mr Alan. This silly woman won't let me stay in the kitchen. Don't worry, Pam. We will tell Alan. He'll help you. Now, now. I'd give her a piece of my mind if I thought she understood what I'm saying. Mrs Freeland? I am Mrs Freeland's sister. There was an explosion on our way back. Lieutenant Freeland was killed. He was buried at sea three days ago. I came as quickly as I could. Alan. Floss! Please. I want to talk to Pam. Hello, darling. I know. Please. Please don't be unhappy. I just. I can't go on without him. There is something. Something you must promise me. Anything. You're going to get well, darling. No, Pam. But no-one .. Need ever know. My baby was never born. Your baby .. Will be mine. Do you understand? Promise me. Promise me. - I promise. Thank you. Now. I can stay here. In happiness. With Alan. Dear Alan. Remember. How worried you were. About us marrying. Now you know. How wonderful he is. How sweet. - Yes, darling. I knew. Pam. Don't go. I won't go, darling. I won't leave you. We'll stay here together, you and I. We can do .. Floss. Floss. The last time I crossed The Channel I made it in 14 hours. How remarkable. You can talk your head off for all I care. I don't understand a word of it anyhow. Pamela, do tell this silly fellow that this baby must have milk on the boat. There's a dear. Mary, dear. If the inspector says it is against the rules then .. I don't care what he says. The baby must have milk on the boat. And milk she shall have. I'll show these foreigners if it's the last thing I do. But Betty, we have milk and the doctor said it was perfectly safe and healthy. Milk in bottles? Never heard of such a thing. The doctor is crazy. He can drink it himself. Our baby won't. Why must the foreigners be so stubborn? It's just the nature of the beast. How do you do? Once more. Can I be of any help? - How nice to see you. I am afraid there is nothing you can do. Indeed there is. This monkey in his fancy suit .. No, no, no. Betty is trying to say she wants Signora Maria to accompany us. And the inspector says it's against the rules. Signora Maria? That is Signora Maria. [ French language ] You see, my pet? I told you I'd have milk for the baby. What on earth did you say to him? I explained that the goat was in Her Majesty's service. You have changed tremendously. The last time I saw you. How long ago is it? Nearly a year. I thought you were the loveliest girl I had ever seen. That is a very doubtful compliment. You were a girl then. Now you are a woman. Different from any woman I've ever known. Honest. Forthright. Independent. - Why shouldn't I be? I can still see you spurning my help while you wrestled with that donkey. There's nothing helpless about you. Don't you think that the dependent myth about women .. Is one that men created? For their own protection. Perhaps. I have a confession to make. What? Our meeting on the dock was not accidental. I wondered about that. It did seem a little fortuitous. How did you know? Her Majesty's diplomatic corps knows everything. When the embassy was notified that you were returning to England .. With Alan's child. I put in for some leave so that I may cross with you. That was sweet of you. Glad you think so. Purely selfish really. Miss Pamela. I hope you're going to let me call on you when you get home. Often. Of course I shall. I am really frightened to death of London. London? No. I thought you lived in Surrey. No. No. I am going to live in London. I am going to live alone. Don't be tactful. Say it. A girl can't live alone. That's what you are thinking, isn't it? Well. What are you going to do? Work. Work? Why not? You do. I will tell you a secret, Mr Lane. Even though I am a woman. I have brains. I intend to use them. Miss Pam. Miss Pam. Pam, something has happened to the baby. The baby. What's happened to the baby? - Nothing to the baby. But look. The water is smooth. Everyone is alright and she is seasick. But. But I advertised for a secretary. For a man. But you are a .. - I am a woman, yes. But I have very neat handwriting. There's no reason why my work shouldn't prove just as satisfactory as any man's. My dear young lady. A girl as a secretary? The whole idea is so startling. So new. Steamboats were once new, Mr Williams. And you accepted them. But a girl as a secretary? No, no. Bless my soul. I would be the laughing stock of London. But perhaps just because it would be such a new idea. It would .. - Sorry. Cannot be done. A salesgirl in a shop? Unthinkable. My customers wouldn't tolerate it. Yes. But don't you see .. - Sorry. Betty. Betty. Is she awake? Yes, young Pam. I am coming. Here she is. Oh, see she smiles at me. No. It's only air in her stomach. Nonsense. She's happy to see me. No, no. What do you want to say? What do you want to say? Mary, I want to hold her always. Why can't I hold her up and say to all the world .. See. This is mine. My daughter. You can't, my dear. That's your punishment. You can never say it. Of course. I'm not sure that I can write at all, Mr White. You can. You've a very nice style. A very nice style indeed. Now this of course, we couldn't use. Not possibly. It wouldn't do at all. The Ladies' Weekly Companion is accepted in the best of families. Articles on emancipation of women and rubbish of that sort won't do at all. No. I see. But this. Is an entirely different matter. It can't corrupt the morals of anyone. I mean to say .. It wouldn't give women ridiculous ideas, if you know what I mean. A simple little story of Italian peasant life. Very edifying. Very edifying indeed. Would be glad to publish it. You mean it? You will buy it? I will earn something? - Naturally. Naturally. I said I would publish, didn't I? How about some more? Could you write any more of these pastorals? Yes. Every day. As many as you like. 'Pastorals'. A good word that. Yes, yes. I will use that in the description. Of course we can't pay much, you know. We're not a rich magazine. Not like the London News you know. Nothing of the sort. We're just a woman's paper. Just a woman's paper. I will write them for nothing, Mr White. What is that? - I said .. I'll write them for nothing Mr White if .. If you will give me a position. What's that? A position? But that's preposterous. A woman working? Why not? Isn't this a woman's magazine? It sets a very dangerous precedent. There's no knowing where it may lead. And yet .. - Yes. Then you'll do it. There's no reason why you shouldn't correct proofs I suppose. But mind, it's a dangerous precedent. I wouldn't want it known. No, no. I'll keep your secret, Mr Job. 'White', I mean. If you will give me the job. Cab. Cab. What luck bumping into you like this. Quite unexpectedly I suppose. Not quite, no. Betty told me. Thomas. Thomas. I have a position. - Wonderful. I hope that means I can see you more often. I have a position. - What? I said I've a position. See here, young lady. - No. Not you. Me. Oh, Thomas. I will see you as often as you like. Oh, Thomas. I have a position and the sun shines again. I have not noticed it. - Oh. I have news for you too. - Good? I am going back to Italy. I've been appointed to the embassy in Rome. I do congratulate you with all my heart. Thank you. I want you to come with me. I love you. - What? I love you. Sir? Not you, ma'am. This lady. I beg your pardon, lady. Pamela. I beg your pardon. But this is an emergency. I have just been asked to marry a good friend of mine. Really? And what do you propose to do about it? I don't know. I am thinking it over. Betty. Betty. Hello. Where have you been? Thomas. Shush. You disturb the baby's bath. What are you doing here? It's a very .. Slippery kind of soap, ma'am. Do be careful. Perhaps you are better qualified. I think you did very well for the first time. Thank you. I've wonderful news. I have already told her about your position. And also that I want to marry you. Don't you think that perhaps I should be consulted? You are being consulted. What is your answer? Well. I can't give you an answer now. Are you going to be really feminine and ask for time to think it over? Exactly. Thank you for suggesting it. I shall give you five minutes. Thomas, you must go. I will go. If you promise to let me take you to the opera on Saturday evening. Anything. But .. - But go? Very well. But this is the last time I shall do it. Here she is. Ready for bed. Betty, what am I going to do? Tell him to go about his business. I don't want him to. My pet, are you sure? I love him, Betty. And now I know that I have never loved anyone else. My lamb. If you love him, why don't you marry him? There's nothing to stop you. There is you, isn't there, darling. - Oh pooh. Who is to know? You've been through enough. I would have to tell him but that's not what I'm afraid of. What else could it be? Suppose it ever came out? He's in the diplomatic corps. A thing like that would .. Mean a scandal. It would ruin his career. Oh, stop fretting. All that the world knows is that you are bringing up your sister's baby. And that is all that it will ever know. Do you think so? Could it be as simple as that? I wonder. Could it? Is the editorial ready yet, Miss? We've got to start setting up type. Just a moment, Mr Perwick. Mr White went home with a bad cold. He told me to find one of the old editorials and run it. Do you think this would do? 'Needlework'. Oh yes. Mr White has always been very partial to needlework. Then set it up, will you? Right, ma'am. That will be everything for this issue? That's all Mr White ordered. Then I will come back tonight and go through the proofs. Very good. Can I help you? I wanted to see the editor. - He's not here at the moment. Is there anything that I can do? It is difficult to start. I felt that as you publish a paper for women this would be the place to come. I mean for advice. Won't you come in and sit down? Perhaps I can do something to help you. What is it you wanted advice about? Is it needlework or cooking or ..? No. It's about my baby. He is sick. I am nearly desperate with him. I don't know what to do next. Is your husband out of work? I haven't got any husband. I can't keep a position anywhere. They always find out, however hard you try to keep it secret. I left home because .. I thought that up here in London .. Everything would be .. Would be different. But some folks from the village came up. They saw me leave the boarding house with my baby. And took the trouble to tell what they knew? Yes, Miss. I got the sack straight off. Milady said her house was no place for a fatherless child. I must take him away. And him ailing and all. I don't know what to do. Where to take him. I can't take care of him myself. The doctors said .. - I know. It takes money. Yes, Miss. I have tried hard. Really I have, Miss. All I want is to take care of my baby. No, no. Please don't cry. I'll find a way to help you. You will, Miss? - Yes. Take this. It will take care of the baby until .. - Miss, thank you. No. Don't do that. Come back here on Monday. - I will. And God bless you, Miss. Mr Lane to see you, Miss. Here? I hope you don't mind. I've changed our plans for this evening. Really? What are we going to do? Pamela, I shall have to teach you not to be so inquisitive. I hope you don't mind missing the opera. I am glad you changed our plans. It is lovely here. I knew the heath would be beautiful tonight. I had advance information. Moreover, after careful consideration. I decided that I wanted you for myself tonight. Pamela. Yes, Thomas. Is that my answer? It must be my answer. You will marry me. Say you will. - Thomas, please. I love you. You know that? - Yes. I know. Then say it. Say you will. Say you will. - No, no. Thomas, please forgive me. I am so grateful to you. For your love. For its warmth and tenderness and everything that's dear. But. But what? I can't marry you. I envy him. Envy whom? That other man. The man you're in love with. How did you know that? - I am not blind. Do you think I didn't see that hurt in your eyes when I first met you? But I hoped. - You mustn't. Not anymore. - It's beyond your control. I love you and as long as I live I shall try to make you love me. I won't. Not you or anyone else. - Don't talk rubbish. You're young and alive. You need someone. I don't. I need no-one. I'll go on by myself. If you won't let me wait for you to see you home. At least let me send the carriage back for you. Thank you, Thomas. Goodnight. Goodnight. Good luck. Thank you. Mr Perwick. Are the proofs ready yet? - Yes, Miss. And a young lady left this note for you. Thank you. Mr Perwick. Editorials alright, Miss? No. I have destroyed them. I am writing a new one. Here's another cup of tea, Mr White. Here is the new number. - Thank you. Minnie. Minnie. My hat. My coat. What is the trouble? You can't go out. I must. I am ruined. My magazine is ruined. I must stop the press. I can't do it. I can't do it, I tell you. You'll have to wait. Mr White, come here and do something please. Perwick, shall I send for the police? Is this a riot? - A riot? You may call it that. They want me to print more copies in an hour .. Than we've printed in all the 32 years we've been here. You mean they want to buy copies? Sit down, Mr White. You look faint. Bless my soul. Auntie Pam, why shouldn't I eat a worm? Because it isn't for eating, my sweet. Why isn't it good for eating? Because it's bad. Why is it bad? Well, it's bad because it's bad. Now run along and play. Auntie Pam. - Yes, my sweet? It isn't bad to eat a worm. How do you know? I just ate one. We have won a victory. But it is only a momentary one. We have not yet achieved any kind of legislation. Which prohibits the employment of children under 12 years of age. This is our goal. Your turn, Floss. Very well. Splendid. - Good one. See how I improved in the past year? Yes indeed. You are getting to be more like your aunt all the time. We have such awful fun when you are here, uncle Thomas. Why do you have to keep returning to Italy? England needs me there. But I should think England would be much happier to have you here. I know we would. Wouldn't we, auntie Pam? Sir Thomas Lane? Yes. You're sure you are Sir Thomas Lane? Quite sure. Then Sir Thomas, I am awfully glad to see you. My dear young lady. You didn't know me? Uncle Thomas, you didn't know me. You? Don't tell me. Flora? I am delighted. How are you, uncle Thomas? - Just splendid. Let me look at you. Grown up. - It has been four years. So it has. And now look at you. A charming young woman. How nice of you to come and meet me. - I couldn't bear not seeing you. Don't I dine at your house tonight? Yes. But I shan't be there. I go down to the country for the weekend. Auntie Pam is bringing you down with her tomorrow. Good. How is Pamela? - She is very well. She was to meet you too but a meeting .. - I know. Yes. Women's rights. And why not? I beg your pardon. I forgot for the moment. That you are the perfect example off the new woman. I am not so bad, am I? My dear. In the strictest confidence. Not speaking officially mind you. I think you're simply marvelous. No wonder you're such a success as a diplomat. It was a most extraordinary experience. As we walked through that station I suddenly realised .. She was the same age that you were. When I first met you. Don't be a cad, Thomas. You show your age too. I've had a very hard life. Years of waiting for a woman to change her mind. Patience was never one of your virtues. - That's where you are wrong. I've been far too patient. But those days are over. Thank you. Now. In three days. I return to Rome to wind up my affairs. Then I prepare to leave for Washington. And you. Like it or not. Are going with me. I am sorry. But you are going to give up this career of success. And settle down as the wife of a stodgy diplomat. You, stodgy? Well. Forty-odd is around the corner. I don't go without you, Pamela. I have loved you for too many years. I love you, Thomas. I always have. You never knew that, did you? Then, what on earth ..? Flora. Do you mean because of the child? Pamela, how could you? She is your niece. We could have adopted her. No Thomas. Not my niece. My daughter. That's why I wouldn't marry you, dear. Not because I didn't love you. Oh, my dearest. Do you think that would have made any difference to me? I was afraid, Thomas. It is only now that Flora has grown. - Afraid of what for heaven's sake? I couldn't know that someday it wouldn't be found out. Think of the scandal. Your career. - Hang my career. Think of the woman I might have had. My dear, you can still have her. If you want her. Thistlewaite. - How are you? Sir Thomas. Nice of you to bring Sir Thomas down with you, Miss Thistlewaite. Kind of you to let me come. - Where is my niece? There she is. Playing tennis. She is still such a child for all her grown-up mannerisms. Don't deceive yourself, dear. Your niece is a most attractive young woman. You should see the way the young men are swarming about her. No danger of her becoming an old maid. Like her aunt. Sir Thomas, really. - No. That's alright, Mrs Seaton. Sir Thomas has lived so many years among savages, he always behaves like one. Very good. Beautiful. Bravo. Beautiful shot. Very good tennis today. An attractive boy. Who is he? - Young Gerald Waring. A nice-looking couple. What? Anything wrong, dear? No. No nothing. Why? Miss Flora is in her room. - Thank you, Betty. It's very late for that child to be out. Don't worry, Betty. Mrs Seaton is bringing her home. Well, I suppose it's alright. But girls didn't stay out as late as this in my time. Evening, Miss Flora. - Evening, Frederick. Hello darling. Did you have a good time? Wonderful. We danced and danced. And danced. Isn't it fun. We go to Gaythorne Manor next weekend. Gaythorne Manor? Gerry has asked his mother to invite us. He wants to show me the estate. And his father? He lives in town. Next weekend you say? I am afraid we can't. I will have to work. If you cannot come I can go with Mrs Seaton. They are to be invited too. You can't go to Gaythorne Manor. You can't go with anyone. Why not? I don't want you to see young Waring again. This isn't like you, auntie Pam. What have you got against Gerry? I have nothing against him. Nothing at all. You can't say anything against him and yet you don't want me to see him again? That isn't reasonable. I am sorry, darling. But you will have to trust my judgment. But without any reason? Whenever there has been anything that you didn't want me to do .. You have always told me why and then let me make up my own mind. Listen to me, Floss. I can't let you go to Gaythorne Manor. I don't want you to see young Waring anymore. You must promise me. If you say I can't go for the weekend I shall have to obey you. I have no alternative. But I certainly won't promise not to see Gerry again. We plan to see a great deal of each other. I forbid it. Goodnight, auntie Pam. Bless my soul, ma'am. That's clear the other side of the city. It will take near an hour to get there. - It doesn't matter. Drive on. And now she's met your son, Gerald. The one man she should never have met. Only as a last resort will I tell her why she must never see him again. You must prevent it. You must help me. You know, Pamela. There are few things that happen which make life worth living. This moment is one of them. Because it gives you satisfaction? - No, no. Not because you ask me. But because I can do it. My son will leave for abroad tomorrow morning. They'll not ever say goodbye to each other. I will see to that. And he will stay abroad until she forgets him. But will he do it? Oh yes. You see, I learned the handling of the weakling from my late dear uncle. 'I shall cut off your allowance'. That's all I have to say. But his mother? My son does not like me. And his mother hates me. Do you know, Pamela. That hatred. Can hold two people together more strongly than love. I don't believe that. Well, it is true. I can tell you. She has asked for a divorce many times. Many times. That's been my only satisfaction. That I could refuse. You see, she wanted to be .. A lady. And she wanted to be rich. Well, she is a lady. But she won't be rich. That is my one real pleasure. Gerald, how terrible. Pamela. In my youth. I did many foolish things. They were worse than foolish. I don't know. But one thing. I cannot forget. Once there was a real feeling of love in my heart. That was for you. You don't believe that, do you. Yes, Gerald. I believe it. Pamela. Perhaps we could .. No, Gerald. Goodbye. Goodbye, Pamela. And her name? - Miss Thistlewaite, milady. You are sure? Yes, milady. I announced her myself. It was past 2 o'clock when she left, milady. I saw her with my own eyes. Thank you. I will send you your money. Well, my darling. It's perfectly ridiculous. But I feel like a young girl saying goodbye to her first beau. You won't be long? - No. Three weeks at the outside. I am making arrangements about the magazine today. Goodbye, my darling. We have a nicer word in Italy. Arrivederci. Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Thistlewaite. You look charming this morning and so radiant. Thank you. I feel radiant. To work. What is there today? I made a clean copy of your Oxford address for the papers. You had better look over it. And this just came for you. - Ah. I don't understand it, Gerald. I've never done anything to hurt her. Why should she now .. She knows that my only thought is to protect you. To keep your name out of the whole thing. That's where she can hurt the deepest. No, Pamela. She will name you as corespondent. Nothing in the world will stop her. Well, Gerald. Whatever happens. I want you to promise me one thing. That you will keep silent. But if I don't explain the reason .. - No, Gerald. If you explain .. Everything will be dragged into it. The whole past. Flora. There is just one thing to do. You must keep silent for her sake. Floss, dear. Come here. I want to talk to you. Come darling. Don't be so tragic. Sit down. After all, it isn't the end of the world you know. Isn't it? No. Of course it isn't, darling. Just give yourself time to forget it. I tell you what. How about a trip to Switzerland? Betty can take you. You did want to go. No thank you. I don't care about it. Darling. Young men have gone away before without even saying goodbye. How did you know that? I don't know. You being so upset. You had him sent away because you were jealous. You were afraid I'd fall in love with Gerry and find a new kind of happiness. That's what you wanted to prevent. - Flora, stop. Suppose I did fall in love with him? What then? Just because you have never been in love, you think it doesn't matter. Well it does, It matters more than anything in the whole world. It's because it matters so much that I want you to wait and not make a mistake. You don't know what love is. All you think about is your career and success. If my mother were alive she'd understand. You never will. You're hard. - You don't know what you're saying. Darling, don't you see .. - Don't touch me. I'll never forgive you for what you have done to me. Never. Send me to Switzerland. Anywhere. Anywhere where I'll never have to see you again. It was three o'clock after midnight. And His Lordship was wearing his dressing gown. I saw him with my own eyes. Although you prefer not to answer my questions, Miss Thistlewaite. After this evidence you cannot deny you visited Lord Gaythorne late at night. You cannot deny you spent considerable time in Lord Gaythorne's quarters. And that you left them at two o'clock past midnight. If there is any explanation for your conduct. Except the one charged. Please say so. Thank you, Miss Thistlewaite. Your silence is answer enough. The court must warn you that your silence is far more damaging to you .. Than any explanation could possibly be. I trust you're now satisfied. Father, please. I am very tired. The arrogant career you started on twenty years ago when you left my house. Has come to a fitting climax. I have done nothing of which I am ashamed. You have stood silent and defenceless in a divorce court. Your talk of not being ashamed. Papa. Please. For what you have done you are being justly punished. I am being punished. Not for visiting a man at two o'clock in the morning. But for what happened twenty years ago. Pamela. That shocks you, doesn't it. But it's time you learned that women are human beings. Have feelings. Get lonely. It's because you made no allowances for that, that this has happened. Now you're blaming me for your foolhardiness. I would cheerfully have gone hungry if I could find sympathy and understanding. But I could not. Not from you. Nothing but coldness and indifference for both Flora and me. Because we were girls. I did no different from any other father. Perhaps not. Perhaps it was your generation to blame and not yourself. I can only say that now, when .. Everything else is gone I have .. Only one satisfaction. That children are beginning to be raised more intelligently. For that I can claim some small credit. Women are beginning to have some standing. Not enough .. but some. Pamela, I am old now. Why not come back to Gideon Grange? Thank you, Papa. I could never go back. It would be no use. Papa. Frederick. Tell Delia to pack my bags and have a carriage here as quickly as possible. The carriage is at the door, madam. - Thank you, Frederick. I am sorry. I know you are, Frederick. Thank you. Where shall I forward your mail? I don't know. I don't know where I am going. Why aren't you in Switzerland? I read in the papers what you were going through. You knew it was going to happen, didn't you. That's why you sent me away. Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Because it was my problem. - No. It was mine. I saw uncle Thomas in Switzerland. He told me .. That was cruel. I made him promise. - You should have told me. What difference could it have made to me, auntie Pam? I mean. I should have been with you. I could have helped you. Don't cry, darling. You could have saved me nothing. I wouldn't give up a moment of it when finally I hold my daughter in my arms. My child, I am so proud of you. And at the moment a little proud of myself. I hope you don't mind my interrupting. But I am a little proud of my self. Thomas. Thomas. You know, Flora. These modern women are so weak. Aren't they. ..w-g..
