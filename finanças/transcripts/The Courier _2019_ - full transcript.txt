You need to follow up with Agent Bryant after they come for me. He knows what to do, but it will be hard for me to communicate with him directly once the chaos ensues. Of course, Father. Anything. Don't make a scene, Alys. It'll all be over in a flash. May I have your attention, please? Everybody stay seated and remain calm. Ezekiel Mannings, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. - I've got a job. - Yes? - Fire her up. I need you back in ten. - Shit. Morning, agents. See, Dad? House arrest isn't so bad. It's just temporary. He won't testify. I take it everything is in its right place. Yes, Father. And so it falls on you now... my love. A prisoner... in my own home. The fucking indignity! Please report in, Agent Parlow. All rise. Due to the circumstance of the case and the individuals involved, we will now hold a closed court where we will hear the testimony from Witness A via a live feed from an undisclosed European location. She's new, right? I mean, I'm bigger than her. And you guys are supposed to be protecting me? So why don't you listen to us, talk less, and I'll do my very best to keep you alive. You do know what Mannings is capable of, right? Oh, God. Please. No, don't. I'll do anything. Please. I'm begging you. All he ever caused in this world is crime and corruption. You're doing the right thing. This will all be over soon. Agent Simmonds arriving down on level one. Preparing for level two extraction. Eyes peeled, boys. You're safe now. I promise. This package is priority, remember? No bullshit. - 'Cause it falls on me. - Have I ever been late? - No. - So, shut the fuck up, Serge. This room is our Fort Knox. It's housed in six-inch bullet- and blast-proof steel. So no one's getting in. The video link is arriving directly from the courthouse. - It's a secure line. - Right. So... I testify and then Mannings rots in hell, yeah? - And you get your life back. - No. I just get a new identity and then I get the fuck out of here. When the package arrives, we'll go straight to a live feed to the courthouse. No one will know your identity. You give your testimony. That's it. And Mannings? Currently under house arrest. Excuse me, ma'am. The, uh, music. Father. What is it, my dear? Can I speak to you upstairs? Yes? Sir, the package is en route. My father will be right out. He has two minutes, Ms. Mannings. Whatever it takes. Finish this. What would I do without you? That's 14 minutes, people. Fuck me. Here we go. Keep sharp, people. Get in. Check this. Now. - Keep still. - I'm unarmed. Shut up. - What the hell. - I said, shut up. I need to confirm your identity. What? I'm supposed to deliver the package to Simmonds. I am Simmonds. Oh, for fuck's sake. Get in. Go. In. Go. Name? - No names. - ID. - I'm just a courier. - That's not good enough. We have clear. And we are almost set. Um... I need to take a piss first. The live feed is now online. - Hey. - Shut up. What the hell is going on? Let's send this motherfucker to hell. Cyanide. You fucking idiot. You just killed a high-value witness. Simmonds? Fuck. Jesus. Fuck. Who is it? I'm trying to save you! Breathe into this. Wait! Wait! Wait! Who are you? I said, who are you? Who the fuck are you? - What? - Get away from me. Don't you get it? Someone is trying to kill you. It was an inside job. - Simmonds was in on it. - No. Why the hell should I trust you? Come on! Hey, you got a phone? Oh, God. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Uh, Simmonds took it. She told me that it could be tracked. I can't believe that bitch tried to kill me. Relax. You're not the only one. See? What? Ballistics vest. Who are you? - I'm just a courier. - That wears a bulletproof vest? Uh... You can never be too careful. Why were those guys choking? What did that in there? The package I was hired to deliver released fucking cyanide into that room. - And you delivered it? - I didn't know what it was! Hey. Hey, relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I just saved your life, didn't I? It's okay. Why did they hire you? - I'm the patsy. - What? They wanted it to look like I was the one who killed you and everyone else in that room before Simmonds took me out. - Fuck. Fuck. - Jesus. Don't panic. Look, all we need to do is get somewhere safe. Okay? You'll be fine. - Can I come with you? - No! Go to the police. Hey! You gonna be okay, yeah? Yeah, sure. We live to fight another day. - What? - Nothing. It's just something my dad used to say. Simmonds, this is Bryant. What's your status? He's gone. What? He's with the courier. The courier? You gotta be fucking kidding me. - I'm not kidding. - I'm dying. Then die. Wait! I have no idea what I'm doing. Okay? But I need to get somewhere. Anywhere. Fast. Shit! That's the only way out. Hold on! Great! Just great! Looks like you got us nowhere quick. But I'm assuming you have a plan for what the... You have a plan for what the fuck we do next. Because that would be really fucking useful. Elevators disabled. Gates locked. All floors are locked down. There's no way out. Give us the witness and we will let you go. Come on. Shit! You're trapped. In a meat grinder. You have no way out... that doesn't involve you looking like chopped liver. Come on! Oh, fuck! You have nowhere to run. Special Agent Roberts. Bryant, what the hell's going on? Lost contact with Simmonds, and the witness failed to make his testimony. The witness is dead. They're all dead. What happened? - Protection unit was compromised. - No. No, I vetted them personally. Simmonds. Simmonds? She was on Mannings' payroll. She was working with a courier. An assassin. They poisoned the team, but the witness managed to get away. Is he alive? They killed him in the parking garage. I was too late. This courier, and Simmonds... do you have them? They're dead. Christ. Without this witness, Mannings walks. Fuck. This is the closest we've ever come to putting him away. I know. It's a goddamn shit-show. Shit. Secure the location. I'll have NCA prep a team and head over right away. I can handle it. It's protocol. - How long? - One hour. I know this game. I know this game. We have a high-value witness under the protection of an unarmed black-market courier. They must be eliminated within the next 58 minutes. This is Mannings. It's me again, sir. I take it the deal has been... acquitted. Not exactly. How so? The deal will be finalized within the hour, sir. I paid a high price for this. You fail me, you and everyone you know will pay a higher one. This way. This way. Fuck. Hey! Fuck. Hey! Hey! Listen. They see you, they see me! And if that happens... Okay, okay. I get it. Do you have a gun? Fuck. Don't you have anything of use? Here. Okay. Take this. - Nice view? - What? Put it on! - What about you? - I can handle myself. Fucking... I'm not a child! Jesus. Pain in the ass. Hey. So, I'm bulletproof, right? Providing they don't shoot you in the head. Come. Quick. Your Honor, clearly the prosecution has no witness, no evidence and, quite frankly, no case for my client to even comment upon. We ask Your Honor for an extension. The case is adjourned for tonight. Find your witness, or I'll have no choice but to dismiss the case. He is just doing that to torture you, you know. It's fine, ma'am. Don't call me "ma'am." You know, under another circumstance... you and I could've gotten to know each other a lot better. In another life. Parallel universe. Tell me, Agent Parlow... what would this parallel universe look like? Call me Mickey. Mickey? Mickey. My father is a great man. And you are a yapping little dog. There is no universe in which you and I could be anything. Because you are nothing. A great man, huh? You do know that your father has some very, very serious charges against him. My father built all of this from nothing. He is a visionary. He is a leader among men. He's had to make choices and take action that you could never comprehend. Because you're a yapping little bitch. Did you kill him? Please don't cry. Oh, shit! What? It's a smart gun. So, what, it knows calculus? It's coded to his hand. It's useless. - Here we go. - What are you doing? Help me. Come on. Okay. Mr. Mannings, looks like we'll be moving out of the premises. All of us? Myself and the agents. Not you and your daughter. What happened? Let's just say it looks like the case against you has collapsed. Tell me, Agent Parlow. You know this how? I got word from the director of the agency himself. Mmm. It's a good job you didn't unpack. We're awaiting confirmation. But I expect we'll be out of here within the hour. I hope you've enjoyed my hospitality. Of course. Mr. Mannings. Finally, things can go back to the way they were. Mm-hmm. It seems so. I knew I could depend on you. Ah. Is he gone? Yes. So, how did you get into this mess? Okay, you don't have to tell me. Ezekiel fucking Mannings, okay? - You curse a lot. - What are you, my fucking mother? Why does he want you dead? Because I'm due to testify against him. I saw something. I didn't do it, Mr. Mannings. I would never steal from you. I'm not that fucking stupid. Whoever they are, they're lying. I swear to you on it. Are you suggesting to me that my daughter is lying to me, Frank? Of course not. I'm... I'm saying, whoever told Alys was lying. Oh, no. No. No, please. I'll do anything. Please, I'm begging you. Please. Oh, God. I think we have a problem. I managed to run away. I went straight to the police and I told them what I saw. I've been in police protection ever since. Mannings... well, he flew back to NYC. And I got stuck here, in the center of a huge joint task force investigation. I'm the only living witness to any of his crimes. So, basically, I'm fucked. Okay. You ready? Yeah. Stay down! - Fucker! - Fuck you! They're coming up to level two! Fuck! I hate cars! When I say jump... Now! They're not here. Where the fuck are you? Hey, do you have a light? Yeah. Come on. - What are you doing? - Boom. Go! Time to punch in. Your services are required. I've been looking into this bitch. We don't know her real name. Just aliases. No Social Security number. No date of birth. No place of birth. No family history. She's a ghost. We will find her. Gotcha. They're on the third floor. Entering the service corridor. Oh, fuck! Fuck! What the fuck! Go! Shit! Go! Go! I'm going! I'm going! Go, go! Sit the fuck down. Come on. Come on. Come on! They're in the service corridor. Help me. - Okay. - Shit! We're trapped. Shit! Shh! I think we lost them. Who are you? Huh? - You're not just a courier. - Oh, don't worry about it. You're the only thing that's keeping me the fuck alive, so yeah, I will worry about it, thanks very much. I didn't mean to swear. You're forgiven. Kickboxing champion or what? I was military. Deniable ops. Served my country. Me and my brother, Danny. He was the only family I had. We were in Syria. My team and I got cover, but Danny was badly hit. The sniper was using him as bait, trying to lure us out, taking potshots at him. I can't get him out of my head. I saw him there... dying in the dirt. Save yourself! Danny! He knew I wasn't gonna leave him. He knew I was... I was gonna try and save him. So... before I could get to him, he grabbed his gun and killed himself. His sacrifice to save me. So I walked out of that war and... fell straight into this one. So, you went AWOL? They call it desertion. I now exist off-grid, unconnected. Alone. Well, you're not alone. I'm here, too. Hey, courier! You killed a good friend of mine. Come out and fight! From what I remember, I think I killed two of you fucking pussies! I'm gonna make you suffer. Where the fuck is she? There. Bryant, come in. Go ahead. We lost them. They escaped through the ventilation system. Get in there after them! We won't fit, sir. Fucking moron! Find out where they come out. If they're not dead before backup arrives, we are all fucked! Come on! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This way. Come on! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! You told me this was a fucking bulletproof vest. - It's a high-caliber round. - Oh, great. Fucking great! Without the vest, you'd be dead. Keep pressure on it, okay? Fuck me, it hurts! He's got us pinned down. It won't be long before the others arrive. What are you gonna do? We have to slip this roof. Can you move? I don't know. You can do this. Okay? Listen to me. We can make it, but we have to move. Live to fight another day, eh? Run! Mr. Mannings. I hear we have cause for celebration. Almost. Well, it was my understanding that the contract was signed and executed. Agent Bryant? Almost, sir. Almost. You're fucking with me. I'm a professional, Mr. Mannings. I'll close the deal. Mr. Mannings? You know what the famous politician Joe Biden once said about hunting? If you need more than ten rounds, and some argue that they hunt with that many rounds, you shouldn't be hunting. Because if you can't get the kill in three shots... you shouldn't be hunting at all! And you are therefore... a fucking embarrassment! Are you an embarrassment, Agent Bryant? I'll get it done, sir. You have my word. Catch the rabbit. Careful. Jesus. You can do this. Courier, I know you're listening. I think we can all agree we've had enough of this bullshit for one night. So I wanna make you an offer. Half a million dollars. A lot more than you'd get for delivering packages around London on your scooter. Hell, he's been shot anyway. A 51-caliber round erupting out of the chamber of an M82 sniper rifle at 900 meters per second. I imagine it tore a hole through him the size of a goddamn fist. If he ain't already dead... he's gonna be. You have five minutes. Be smart, courier. I'm listening. Yeah. Baby. I got your attention. You did. I think we can all walk away from this smiling like... the cats who got the cream. That's why I'm going to tell you how this is gonna work. No one is walking away. I will annihilate all of you because you have no clue who I am. I will bleed you dry and grind your bones to dust. I'm your worst nightmare, and I will rain hell down on you, you piece of shit. Thank you. Fuck! You can be scary. You know that? I need to get you to a hospital. We don't have a lot of time. Sorry. This is gonna hurt. Wait, wait. Careful. But I need to stop the bleeding. You're gonna be okay. You're doing well. I need to hide you somewhere first. And then I'll go and take out this piece of shit. Okay? Hide me where? Here? - No. They'll be here soon. - Then where? I'll figure it out. We're done. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Take the knife and hold it. Okay? - What are you gonna use? - Don't you worry. Stay there. Don't get up. No fucking way. She cut the fucking power. Get to the maintenance room. And get the power on. Copy. Can't see a fucking thing. Sights? Any sights? It's time. Whoa, whoa, whoa, friend. Relax. Just me. I'd have shot you. Move. Come out, you fucking rat. I've had worse fucking paper cuts. Fuck. Fuck you! - Stop! - What? Nick Murch is gone. His testimony is gone. The feds are gone. Bryant hasn't confirmed. And he has been consistent in not confirming. So, put the bottle back in the fucking bucket! And go to your room! Lights. Shit. Hello? Interpol has a team that's 23 minutes away from your location. Perfect, sir. Listen to me! You fucking find him! You fucking find him now! Courier. Courier. Courier! Courier. I wonder what happened to you... to make you this angry. You had problems with your father? I could find him for you. I could hurt him. I could hurt him real bad. I don't have much time. I wanna make this quick. Where the fuck is that rabbit? You're so pretty. You're so pretty. Where the fuck is that rabbit? Look, we are where we are. It is what it is. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Fuck's sake! Why are you even doing this? You involved me. I gave you the chance... to walk away... a rich woman. Come on. You think this is a fucking joke? This is not a joke. Yeah, that's right. Where is he? Have it your way. Let's let that little rabbit decide. Nick? Nick? Come out, come out, wherever you are. You have 30 seconds... until your partner is run over and crushed... unless you come out now. Twenty-five. Twenty. Thirteen. It's okay. It's all right. Seven seconds. Fuck it. Do it. No! Nick. Just in time. You don't look so good. Right? Run! Nick! There's no way out of this! Oh! You're gonna be dead in half an hour judging by how much blood you're losing. Don't worry. You won't feel a thing. The next time I put a bullet in you, it'll be the last. Rabbit. Rabbit. Run, run, run. Run, rabbit. Run, rabbit. Run, run, run. Run, rabbit. Run, rabbit. Run, run, run. Feel that? Good boy. You little shit! You're a dead man! You got spirit, Nick. I'll give you that. But it's time to set that spirit free. Come on! Nick. Nick? Nick, hey. Hey. Hold on. Hey, Nick, stay with me. Hold on. Nick? Oh, no. No, no. I'll get you to a hospital. Hold on. Doctor! I need a doctor! Help me with this. Quickly, quickly. Easy, easy. - Thank you. - We live to fight another day. What's your name? You never told me your name. What's your name? What's your name? I thought you boys were moving out. No. We're actually here to move you out. Someplace a little smaller. Rikers Island has a dank little cell just waiting for you. What do you think you're doing? Nick Murch is still alive, Mannings. Sorry about the, uh, indignity. Good morning, Nick. I'm a federal agent. My name is Special Agent Roberts. It appears we have a mystery woman who seems to have saved the day. Yeah. She saved my life. Problem is, we can't have a vigilante taking control of official business. - Yeah. - No matter how useful they are. Is there something you want to ask me, Agent? I take it you don't know her name. No. Well, then... you make sure you get some rest. - Good morning, sir. - What? I have some bad news. Bad news? He claims he doesn't know her name. So I'm afraid we're still very much in the dark. Are you able to get this done? Yes, sir. So catch the rabbit. Of course, sir. Consider the rabbit caught.
