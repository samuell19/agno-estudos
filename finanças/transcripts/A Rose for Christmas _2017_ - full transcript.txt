Van Gogh once said, "great things are done by a series of small things brought together". So don't second-guess yourselves. Just paint, draw, create! It's Christmas! One way or another, your artwork will be amazing. Photography's next semester, Eric. You know how you love lifting weights? Let's try lifting a paintbrush. Okay. You got this. And on our acquisition of East Wind Financial, our January deadline is not going to happen... Because I closed the deal last night. Now, I know this means a working Christmas for some of you, but the real Christmas present here is the increased reach this merger gives our company. Thank you. Bulldozer Cliff strikes again. Good job, though not everyone seems to think so. Yeah, I guess that's why I got a lump of coal from my office secret Santa. So, what's next? Pack your bags, Cliff. I need you on a plane. Opening the new Shanghai office? Actually, supervising the building of our Rose Parade Float. Think of it as a chance to hone your team-building skills. Whose idea was this? Yours, when you convinced me we needed more worldwide visibility. A North Lake float means millions of global customers learning our name... Perfect to launch our overseas expansion. But sir... We've hired a float design firm, best in the business. You're flying to California first thing in the morning, and just try to keep things simple and on-time. The stakes couldn't be bigger for us. So I'm not getting the Shanghai office? You're not getting it yet. I'm just keeping you hungry. You ace this assignment, you write your own ticket. Beautiful work. Merry Christmas! Eric, I believe this is yours. Look, we need to talk. You are distracted in class. You don't do the assignments. Ms. Lindry, trust me, I'm trying! You know, maybe if I saw some of your work, I'd get inspired? You get an "A" for trying to change the subject, but I don't show my work. Merry Christmas, Eric! Merry Christmas. So once the float's frame is welded and built, that's when our dry-decorating starts. Every single item in these boxes will eventually end up being used. You see, kids, every inch of a Rose Parade Float has to be decorated with botanical materials, anything from walnut shells to lima beans! Hi there. I'm looking for someone named... Then, after Christmas, the roses arrive, and it's a mad sprint to finish decorating the floats. Then, on New Year's eve, the parade officials show up to make sure the floats are parade ready. Excuse me? Excuse me! Excuse me, sir! Sorry! Can I help you? Yeah. I'm here to see Al Lindry? Big Al's not here right now. I'm from North Lake Financial. You're building our float. Yes, you have an appointment. I think it's tomorrow. Yeah, I'm early. I'd like to get ahead of schedule. Bottom-line is, I'm here to help. Great! Well, decorating starts soon and we can use as many hands as we can get. Not that kind of help. I'm here to make sure everything runs smoothly until my boss gets here in three weeks for the parade. I'll be taking charge and overseeing things. You look a little old to be a babysitter. And you don't look like a typical welder! Cliff Baskers. Andy. Your parents named you "Andy"? What can I say? They wanted a boy. Big Al's my dad. I just pitch in part-time with the welding. Big Al's your dad? Why didn't you say anything? And interrupt your "I'm in charge" speech? I didn't want to be rude. Sorry if I came on a little heavy before. At the office, they call me "The Bulldozer". I see an obstacle in my way, I just knock it over. You must be really popular at the water cooler. Business isn't about popularity. Did your parents name you Cliff 'cause they wanted to push you off one? Is this our float? Yes, this will be the proud bear from your company logo... We just have to add foam, dry decorations, and about 20,000 roses. Great, and is there a particular methodology you follow? Happy chaos? "Happy chaos?" Not on my watch. Here, I've drawn up a schedule. If you could pass that along to your dad? Conference call in an hour. Mr. Ellsworth likes to stay updated. I should go. I'll tell my dad you stopped by. Nice to meet you... Mr. Bulldozer. Miss Chaos. Hello? Yes, I'll be right there. Dad! I got here as soon as I could. Sweetie, you didn't have to rush. I'm fine. I'm as fit as a fiddle. A fiddle that could use some tuning. He needs to rest. That dizziness your dad felt last month was a heart flutter, and he had another one this morning. "Flutter?" What am I, a butterfly? Wait, last month? Why didn't you say anything? And have you worried by the endless tests this guy is putting me through? Sweetie, remember why they call me "big Al"... Because I take on all the big problems. But dad, this is serious. Now, look, the initial tests turned out fine, but consider this a wake-up call. I've ordered some follow-up tests, but I need you to de-stress and take it easy until we know more. "De-stress?" How much more de-stressed can I be? As it is, I only have one client. Can we wrap this up, all this medical stuff, doc? I've already let things slip behind schedule! Dad, you can't do it all. Look, I'm fine! Managing the circus is what I do... And if I don't do it, who will? Maybe your daughter can take the lead this year? Wait, me? No, no, no, I've got this. Not this year, you don't. He's right, dad. Look... Andy, sweetie, you've got more than enough on your plate. You're teaching. You're pitching in with the float. You've had zero time to focus on your own work! Never mind that. But I do mind! Stop worrying about me. I'm worried about you! Trust me. I got this. Andy, I know how much your dad loves his work. He's a legend. It's more than that. The business is his connection to my mom since she passed away. Look, he'll be fine if he rests up a bit, but someone else will have to do the heavy lifting this season. Understood. Merry Christmas, Andy. Merry Christmas. Okay. Hey, Em! Thank you for coming by. I brought muffins. I know how busy you are, and you never take time to eat so, you're our new fearless leader? Let's just say leader. I don't know about fearless. Did you see these volunteer rosters? Dad never even put out the call for volunteers! Oh, you're kidding! No, I'm not. I guess with everything going on with his health, it just kept sliding further down the checklist, so present company excluded, our a-team of volunteers has signed on to other floats by now. Oh, honey. Well, I'm here to help, and I think I can get my neighbors, Elliot and Mary, to pitch in. Thank you. That is a start, but we are going to need way more help than that if we have any hope of succeeding here. If this goes off the rails, dad's whole business could go under. Well, your mom always said nothing is impossible. And I agree with her. The company has launched dozens of floats down Colorado Boulevard for three generations, and I am not going to let us fail now. Okay. So, what I think we can do... Cliff, hey. Thank you for meeting me here. I really needed to talk to you. That sounds serious. Let's walk. Okay. So, I looked at the schedule of yours, and it's ridiculous! Look, why don't you stick to the art and let me handle the tough stuff? The art is the tough stuff! Look, no offense, but you don't know the first thing about float decorating. No, I don't. Our dry-decorating hasn't even started yet. You've scheduled it to be finished by Saturday? We're already behind schedule. Mr. Ellsworth believes in results, so when we set up the live feed, I want him to see decorating already underway. Look, Cliff, my father is under the weather, so I'm taking over, and he wasn't able to put out a call for volunteers, so we don't even have a team yet. We don't have a team? No. What am I going to show my boss, a metal frame? I don't know, Bulldozer, but this schedule you've committed us to is simply impossible. Look, I'm sorry about your dad... Thank you. But it's a float. How difficult can it possibly be? First order of business, I'm going to take charge of the volunteer recruiting. And how do you plan to do that? I'll use a multi-pronged approach involving message board posting, viral advertising, and targeted social media engagement. - You? - Yeah. Somebody's got to do it, and clearly, your approach is... A little chaotic. Don't know. How about this fella? I love it, but a little too short. Look! This one's lost half its needles. You're sure you're not being too picky? Dad, selecting the right Christmas tree is an art. Speaking of picky, when are you going to let me set you up on that blind date? I'm a little busy right now. I know, and that's on me, but come New Year's, you've got to get back out there! Andy, hello? Dad, this one is a keeper. Why do I bother? You never listen to me anyway. Kind sir, can you help us? We'd love this tree. Can you pack this up for him? All right, dad, I'm late, but I love you. I love you too. And we have a Christmas tree! - Bye! - Bye. Thank you guys so much for your help. You are sculpting like rock stars. It takes our minds off our empty nest back at home. Our son's spending Christmas with his fiancee's folks in Duluth, and our daughter's in Europe for work, so... So please, distract us! Gladly... The volunteers will be here any... So sorry! That is going to dry hard. See you're living up to your credo of "happy chaos". Sorry. Missed a spot. Okay. Well... It's 9:00 a.m. sharp. You think we're going to have enough donuts for all those volunteers you promised? Are you ready to let me handle the recruiting now? So you're an artist, huh? More like an art teacher now. What happened? I don't really want to talk about it. - Why not? - Because I just don't. That gives me a great idea for a New Year's resolution. Well, I'm glad you realize you've got room for improvement! It's actually a New Year's resolution for you. You should learn how to pick up on other people's signals. Interesting... And this is just a thought, but you might resolve to keep your opinions to yourself once in a while. No, that's not going to happen. Yeah, I figured it was reaching. Community college, huh? What exactly are we doing here? I teach an art class here, and no one has more time on their hands than millennials. See? Especially during Christmas. So pretend like you're Santa recruiting your elves and make yourself useful. Watch. Hey! We are building a float... Hey, we're looking for volunteers for a float. Skateboard on over! We'd love to see you. Hey there! We're building a Rose Parade Float. We would love to have you there. Hi! Look, Eric, trust me. You're going to love it. Decorating? Yeah, I don't know about that. Dude, believe me, I know what you mean, but you know what they say... No pain, no gain. Push your elbows together while you press. Can we stay on the matter at hand, the float? Look, Ms. Lindry, I appreciate the offer, but it's really not my thing. It might be! I mean, I am tossing you a life preserver in the form of an independent study. I mean, your grade in art is, like, a c-minus at best. It'll raise his GPA? Yes. - Oh, he's in. - -Great! Coach, seriously? Old management trick. Helps to go directly to the top. Nice work! Good morning! We are looking for volunteers for our Rose Parade Float. - Thanks. - -Free pizza! Free pizza. We are looking for volunteers, and we would love to have you there. It's our Rose Parade Float. I'll handle this. Merry Christmas! Hi! Or should I say "fleece" navidad? Fleece? Get it? Knitting humor? He's funny! Do you mind if we hand out some flyers? We are building a float for the Rose Parade, and we would love your help. It's a great group of people. How we doing? Well, we got a couple dozen maybes and a lot of "merry Christmases," so we've got a long way to go. Rose parade, huh? Yes... And we could use some help, so your steak and eggs are on this guy, if you hear us out. Now, my family's been involved in the Rose Parade for many, many years... Just spread them out a little bit more, hon'. Dad, I got this. Maybe I should go grab the other ladder and help. No, no, just sit down. Relax. Enjoy your hot chocolate. Honey, I'm fine. Besides, you know me. A little decorating is therapeutic. A little? You promised to take it easy this year. I can't help myself. I've got time on my hands and decorating in my blood. Let's finish the fence. You know, you don't have to spend all your weekends with me. Who else would I want to spend time around Christmas? When are you going to slow down and do something for yourself? Dad... We've had this conversation a million times. You know, the holiday gala's coming up soon. How about you stand in for me this year? I mean, somebody from the company's got to put in an appearance, and, hey, you might meet somebody nice there, and it would make your father very happy. Okay, I'll go. Great. You need to be putting yourself out there. These lights are going to be beautiful. Don't change the subject. Okay! The broken record's done skipping. So how are things down at the warehouse? I am going stir-crazy here. They're going great, but we do miss our four-star general. And the fella from North Lake? Don't ask, but I have made a New Year's resolution to look on the bright side of things. We handed out 2,000 flyers, so I'm hoping for the best. That's the spirit! Good job. Not a bad turnout, considering. Yeah, it's time to separate the wheat from the chaff. Cliff, are you nuts? We need to take anyone and everyone! No, I've hired hundreds of people. If I've learned anything, it's that you only take the top 10%. A hundred percent of people have talent, if given the chance. That's as statistically impossible as it is absurd. No, trust me... I got this. Can you tell me about a challenge you encountered that you bulldogged through and then got results from? No? We're looking for volunteers who are fully committed to the Rose Parade. Why are you fully committed? Well, I don't want to fail... Great. My art class. Okay. So, Christine, I see you are a physics student. Why do you want to volunteer for the Rose Parade? I'm trying to do one thing a day that scares me. That's great. Last week, I tried rye bread. Rye bread? Yeah. Making it? Eating it. So do you have any experience building Rose Parade Floats? Building? None, but as former rose queen, I have ridden on my fair share. Right, and if you volunteer with us, you'll need to get your hands and, oftentimes, your clothing quite dirty. Is that something you're comfortable with? Yes! Yes. Yes. Great. And what about any experience with flowers or natural decorating materials? I spend 10 months out of the year driving a big rig, so... None. Great. - Yeah. - Yeah. What are natural decorating materials? Thanks for coming by. You bet. I'm always happy for an early start. - I brought us coffees. - Thanks. What's with all the sheets? No, don't worry about that. So here they are. Great, you got the wilderness girls. No, they actually got snatched up by the south Pasadena community float, and we lost a couple others, too. Like I said, we need to take anyone and everyone. Okay, fine. You win. Okay... And we need to find a few more like Emily, too, if we're going to pull this off. Emily? Emily bowed out. Wait, what? Why? Yeah, I don't know. Something about my being too controlling. Cliff! You just lost us the best dry-decorator in all of Pasadena, if not the world! Come with me. We've got to get her back right now! Come on! What could you possibly have said to her? I really don't see why one person's worth all this trouble. Really? Hello, darling. Emily, how do you make golden bear fur? Two parts tamarind shells, one part gold strawflower petals, put in a cement mixer for 30 minutes, add golden flax seed, and mix with coconut husks. Emily... Will you... come back? Because? Because... I'm sorry. Yes, for you dear. Not for you, wingtips. I'll get my things. I'm glad you saw the light. Yeah, I just didn't want to be on the receiving end of a woman with a blowtorch. That's our team, and this late in the game, we are lucky to have them. We need the float ready for inspections by New Year's eve. Hello, everyone. My dad, he usually kicks things off with a few words, but clearly, I am not big Al... I just want to say thank you so much for being here, and we truly appreciate you giving us your time during Christmas... Some may say that our challenge is daunting, that the odds are against us, and while it is true that we are completely and totally understaffed, and the roses are going to start arriving in only nine days, that means it's just going to be a race against time. Andy, what are you doing? I'm inspiring the team! No, clearly, you're scaring them. Christine! Come back. Think like Van Gogh. I have never supervised a float before... But I don't think Vincent Van Gogh did either, and he once said that, "great things are done by a series of small things brought together". And if that isn't us, I don't know what is. We have a chance here to do something great, something that people might remember forever, so what do you guys say? Let's build a great float! So now, we have the bear assembled, and we painted the float, so we know where all the dried petals and colored seeds go. Helps all you greenhorns stick to the design. And now, we take our glue. Put in your paintbrush. We add it directly to the float. We then place on the moss, and then next, we're going to take the colored seeds and place them one at a time using tweezers. Wait, one at a time? The parade is this New Year's, remember? Art can't be rushed, Cliff. Clearly, not when you're in charge. It's not rocket science. It's putting flowers in glue. Okay, guys, pick up the pace! So we put these on the outside. - Yes, I agree. - Paint them white. That will look good. Eric? I think those flowers right here, they should be red. Right! Wait a minute. Has Eric been having trouble with colors? That's beautiful. Are you sure this whole webcam thing is a good idea? Sure. It keeps my boss in the loop. And we might have the Rose Parade host and camera crew coming by later to shoot a promo. And shouldn't we wait 'til we're a little further along in the decorating? Yeah, we should be further along in the decorating process. If you think decorating is so easy, why don't you give it a try? Are you afraid to get your hands dirty, or you think you're above it? I'm supervising. Right. Honestly, I'd rather be in Shanghai. Shanghai? Yeah, heading up my company's whole Asian operations. It's where I'm supposed to be, and where I will be once this is done. Well, excellent! I kind of look forward to you being in Shanghai, too. Miss Lindry? There's a problem. I might be allergic to flowers! Sweetie, did you just realize this now? I didn't totally think it through. But it's the Rose Parade. Okay, let's just... There's tissues right over there. You just take a little break. Off to a great start. Well, it always takes the newbies a little time to find their decorating legs, but we're going to be fine. Okay? Lou, you ready for the water test? Just got to tighten this one last pipe, and then we can do the water test. Let's get moving. Come on, guys, let's check it out. - Let's see it! - Okay, Andy, can you press the black button on that panel? We're going to see how the water flows. You ready? Yeah. Yeah! - Yeah. - Nice work. Good job. No, no, no, no, no! Stop! Red button! Red button! Red button! - Red button! - It's not working! Quick! Quick! Quick! What? Where is it? Turn off the spigot! Turn it off! No... That was bad. Pump's broken. And we captured it all on webcam. At least it can't get any worse than this. Yeah... Hi! I'm Mark Steines. I'm here to do the interview... Hi! You want me to come back later? Maybe after the monsoon-season ends? That would be great! Sure. Do you need help? Yes, we do! No... Here. Thank you. Thank you. Let's reschedule, yeah? - That sounds great. - Good. Merry Christmas! Same to you. Happy New Year! Take care. Stay dry. Thank you! 'Kay, watch the water, Bill. Off he goes. Mr. Ellsworth, wasn't nearly as bad as it looked on the webcam. I find that hard to believe. It's just that these creative-types don't always understand the bigger picture. Or maybe it's that the business-types don't understand that float decorating is an art of its own! I'm sure you two can work this out. Is that all? Then goodbye. Thank you for throwing me under the bus, by the way. That's rich. Blame me! You know, instead of "Bulldozer", they should call you "apple pie", on account of how quickly you crumble. Are you done? No, but our float might be! We're going to be behind schedule and over budget, and if we don't pass inspection, that means no parade for us. If... Did you hang up the phone? Nope. I got this. Nonsense, I got it. You a longshoreman when you're not working here? There's "tough", and there's "Rose Parade tough". I'm the latter. Never knew a float could use so much Spanish moss. So you known Andy very long? Gosh, all her life. She always been as stubborn as a mule? Andy knows her mind, all right. Ha! One way of putting it. I know she's an artist, but what else does she do? What doesn't she do? She loves to hike. She bakes. She volunteers. Her rummage sales alone helped her church build a new youth center. Why do you ask? Just... Trying to find some common ground. You could start by respecting what we do. Well, well, well! You again. Mr. Bulldozer. Miss chaos. What are you doing here? A little shopping for a friend. What? You have friends? That's amazing. Male or female? It's actually a gift for my mother. You have a mother? I know I can be a little overbearing sometimes. I'll try to take my foot off the gas. This place is a minefield. What do you mean? Everywhere I look are reminders of how soon our deadline is. Are you getting nervous? Fine, look... I've got a lot riding on this, okay? Thing is, Mr. Ellsworth's pretty intolerant when it comes to failure, and we're not off to a great start. If I deliver, I'll get the promotion I've been working towards my whole career. Is that your dream? I... I'm not a "dreams" person. Come on, Cliff. Everyone needs a passion. Well, it's a goal. I understand that. I mean, it's all I can do to keep my dad's business afloat. Well, maybe we have something in common after all... Pressure. That gives me another idea for a New Year's resolution for you. It's okay to sometimes ask for help. And I've got one for you... Don't smile so much when you know you're right. How about from now on, I handle all the decisions when it comes to decorating, and you handle everything else, or to put it in terms you may understand, we make this a win-win? You had me at win. Okay, everyone! I just want to let you know that Cliff and I have worked it out, and we are on the exact same page from here on out. That's right. A coach and an assistant coach need to get along for a team to win. Right, Eric? And to be clear, Cliff is the assistant coach here... And the assistant coach is snacking on our decorating palette! Sorry. I love edamame. Okay, so let's get started. Ashley and Lou, you will be on decorating duty with Emily. 10-4. We're on it. And Mary and Elliot, can you finish up the critters today? We want to have those ready by tomorrow... And Eric? I think I owe you an apology. You're colorblind, aren't you? And that's why you've been having trouble in class? It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Christine, come here! I have a mission for you two. I want you to go to all the other float barns and scope out what they have going on, 'Kay? Awesome! Have fun. And Cliff, we are running low on a few supplies. Do you think you could help me out with these? Sure. Coconut husks? Tamarind seeds? Millet? Where am I going to find this stuff? 'Kay, it might be best if I handle this one myself. No, no, no. Remember our agreement. You take care of the artwork, I do everything else, including the purse strings. Okay, then grab your credit card. We're going shopping. Never leave home without it. That clanking noise when you park means your caliper's not mounted right. Thank you. Who would have figured you for a gearhead? A rusty one. I love cars, but it's been a long time since I've looked under a hood. Well, it must be hard, being away from your family at Christmas. Actually, it's kind of a relief. What, you don't like Christmas? Honestly, I like when it's over. Yeah, Christmas for me is the day the stock markets close and everything just stops. So you'll be spending Christmas in your hotel room? No, I've got a couple colleagues in town. What about you? I'll be going to my dad's house. He always has us over. It's really fun, but I have to admit, this year, I am feeling the stress of finishing the float, and just a million other things going on. You are always on the move. You should slow down a bit. You're one to talk. Hey, I work hard, but I take time to enjoy. You just work hard. Honestly, I... I don't get it about parades. I mean, all that work, they go by, then it's over. Come on! I mean, you get out there on New Year's day, it's incredible! You've got precision equestrians, a marching band, b-2 fly-over, all these amazing floats. I mean, the flowers fade, but the floats, they live on in people's memories. Trust me, when you see the parade up close, you'll understand. I will, huh? You will. Come on. $50 a pound? That must be a mistake! What can I say? My supplier in Asia's got me over a barrel. That's highway robbery. We can't afford that. What're we going to do? I'm going to make a call. Great. Thanks for the help! What are you doing? I minored in mandarin. The supplier said for the Rose Parade, he'll donate our supplies for free. He's over-nighting what we need to the warehouse. Wait, what? I've got to say, you are full of surprises. That's as close to a compliment as I think I'm going to get. What's next? One final stop. Come on. We just have to swing by my place. This'll be quick. I just have to pick up a few things for the float. Hello? No, no, no, I'll be there. The documents are signed. Great doing business with you. Goodbye. That's amazing. Nothing to see here. No, that's really great! You should show that off! It's just something I do for myself. No one needs to see it. But this is really good. But it takes work and time, and I have no time, so lately, it's just a way to channel my frustration. Well, then... I guess you owe me a debt of gratitude for all the inspiration. Well, look, I'm no art critic, but this could be in a gallery. You're just being nice. Do I look like someone who's just being nice? Why don't you put it out there, let the world decide? I saw a poster in town for an art auction at the holiday gala. Why don't you submit it? Cliff, I don't show my work. I've got another New Year's resolution for you. Challenge yourself. Get out there! Okay, there's way too many paint fumes in here. I think we should get back. Come on. What's going on? Well, we are back from recon, and we are in for some serious competition with the other teams. Animation, surround sound, and almost all the floats this year have moving parts and hydraulics. We're going to have to kick it up a notch. No, no, no, our current float is just fine! Mr. Ellsworth couldn't have been clearer. He said simple and on-time. On-time I get, but simple? Cliff, 80 million people watch this parade. We can't deliver just any float. We've got to do something amazing. Amazing, or impossible? It's the Rose Parade. People do the impossible all the time. If we add animation to get the bear moving, I can help with the physics. And I know a little bit about hydraulics. And Cliff, didn't you say you're an ex-gearhead? It's been years. Besides, adding animation this late in the game would be a risky gamble. Don't business leaders get where they are by taking risks? Are you bulldozing me? Look... This is the only thing standing between me and Shanghai. Can we please just keep it simple? But don't you see? By going big, we're going to show the world that not only is sunshine floats at the top of our game, but we build a show-stopping float. I don't know. This coming from the man who just told me to challenge myself? I'm making the same resolution for you. All right, fine. Yes! Thank you! Let's do it. All right, guys! Let's do this. So, what's the plan? You're going to work on hydraulics... You guys ready? - Ready. - Ready. - Cliff, you got this? - Yep. Going up! Okay, the bear's coming forward. All right! Nice! Keep it coming. - Got it? - Yep! Keep going, and... Set! Whoa! Going down. Keep going, keep going! Keep it coming! Nice! Hey, Rockefeller finally got his hands dirty! What can I say? These big toys bring out the inner child in me. Lou! How's it going? Good. We can put the hydraulics under here, and then we attach the swivel system to the bear. Then we should be good to go. Great. Let me know if you need any help. 10-4, boss. In the meantime, we have plenty of dry decorating to do, so let's get back to work! Our team is a decorating machine powered by coffee. Yeah, well, here's hoping it doesn't stall. I love this store. I used to come here with my parents when I was little. All right. What? You didn't have any family Christmas traditions? Making gingerbread, singing Carols? Apart from the odd snowball fight, Christmas for me was my parents entertaining work friends. I'd watch a Christmas movie with one of various nannies, and off to bed. I'm sorry you didn't have more holiday fun. Do you honestly still not like Christmas? Sure, I like Christmas. As a matter of fact, I've got you an early Christmas present of sorts. I entered you into the art auction at the holiday gala. - You did what? - Yeah. It's done. Look, they printed the program. Why would you do that? Well, "challenge yourself," remember? It's a two-way street. For me to fail miserably? Cliff, my work isn't done! Well, what's the big deal? Just finish it! It needs something more, something to pull it all together. Like what? I don't know! If I knew that, it would be finished. Cliff, you just... You don't get it. Andy! Cliff, right? You're big Al? They call me "big Al" because I make all the big decisions. Have a seat. Thank you. So, what's the problem? Decorating giving you trouble, or mechanics? Actually, sir, it's... your daughter. Yeah, I heard about that auction stunt of yours. I just don't get it. Andy's a true artist. She can be sensitive about her work. I thought I was helping. Her work is amazing! Look... Your heart's obviously in the right place, but my daughter has an incredibly strong will. I know. And sometimes, it's just better to go along with her. You know, in 1934, the parade theme was water, and that was the year that it rained the whole day. Don't worry. Parade day's always so sunny that right after it's over, people from all over the country move out here for the sunshine. The year I was rose queen? Five and a half miles of California sunshine. Hey, what's going on here? It's Andy's idea. I'm drawing numbers to show Eric where different flowers go. Carnations are twos, daisies are threes... It's like a giant paint-by-numbers. That's smart. Cliff! I was just thinking... Why don't we go 50-50 on that ticket to Shanghai? I feel like we're robbing Asia of your presence. I deserve that. I realize now I should have talked to you first. I was honestly trying to help, but... I'm sorry. I can... I can see that you had good intentions... Just in your Bulldozer-y way. Well, let the Bulldozer help. Let me run interference here, and it'll give you time to do your own work. The guy who hates decorating wants to lead the team? Try me. Maybe it's time the assistant coach got in there and spread his wings. - Thanks. - All right. That's great. Insert the pole in the belly as far down as you can go. We can either hang this from the knot and just... So, wind down the thing. Yeah, no, the other way. Nice work! You guys have made great progress. The float looks amazing! Thanks, but I just checked the weather. 60% chance of showers for the big day. Just what we need... More obstacles. Every parade throws some curve balls. That's just part of the fun of float building. My husband is an equestrian in the parade, and he's had to round up more than one runaway pony. Fog, rain, floats breaking down... I've seen it all. I used to go to the parade every year before I started driving my truck. I always wanted to go to the parade, but I was too nervous. There are so many people. It seems noisy and overwhelming. Well, look at you now. Maybe you'll be in the parade this year. You know, we need two drivers for the float. And no matter what happens, there's always a solution. It's these obstacles that bring us together. That's why, by New Year's, we're all a family. Nice. Can you pass me some more of that moss? You got it. Thank you. Hey, everyone! As you know, it's Christmas eve, so we just want to wish you a very merry Christmas, and rest up for crunch week! Thank you so much for everything, and we really appreciate the sacrifice. Sacrifice? I've been on some long hauls over Christmas. Doing this feels like coming home. Before you all head out, you might want to check out the Christmas tree. Gifts? Well, normally, yes, but this year, it's... I took care of it. Cliff! Thank you. That's for you. Thank you! Careful! Mary, Elliot, I know you've been missing your kids a lot this holiday season, so I arranged for them to Skype in in the office. Thank you! Can we open them? Well, yeah, of course! A Christmas sweater? You told me the temperature dropped when the roses arrive, so I hope I got the right size. I love it. A nail gun! Thanks, Rockefeller. Guayusa Chai tea? Where did you find this? I have my sources. Thank you. A telescope? Great for gazing at the stars, or spying on floats. Lifting gloves? Man, you shouldn't have! It'll help you grip the free weights. This is a beautiful scarf. Well, merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas! Thanks, Cliff! Merry Christmas! Take care, you guys. Merry Christmas! Thanks, Cliff! Thank you so much! Cliff, that was so thoughtful of you. Well, I should get going, too. I have a painting to finish and family to see. Of course. What are you doing for Christmas again? My colleagues are in town. Right. Going to head over there. Okay. Well... Well... Merry Christmas. Bye. Bye. Hello. Yeah, dad, hey. No, I just... I lost track of time. I've been up all night. Of course! Merry Christmas. Okay. I'll be over in a second. I just need to check on something. See you soon. 60... I thought you were room service. I thought you'd be here. What happened to those supposed friends of yours? Got me. Get ready. You're coming with me. You know, this... This really isn't necessary. Just pipe down and enjoy. My dad's Christmas ham rocks, and no team member of mine is going to spend Christmas alone, even if he did turn my world upside-down. Hey, everyone! This is Cliff, and he loves Christmas! Hey, Cliff! Welcome, Cliff. Thank you. Hey, they need another body for football. It's a Christmas tradition here... Our own family rose bowl. Uncle Jason and the others play pretty rough, so he would love to. Come on. I want you to meet everyone. Good man. Are you ready, Mr. Bulldozer? Ready as I've ever been. - Ha, nice try! - Nice. Okay, so, on three. Go! Stay with me. Come here. What? What? Hey! Come on! Nice play! Someone's going to have to pay for this. I think it's you! Or you! What? No! Don't even think about it. Should I? I've got to hand it to you... You really know how to throw a Christmas. Thanks... But you better rest up. Crunch week on the float. The roses fly in tomorrow. Ooh! Cheers to that! Cheers. These are amazing! My family has sent floats down Colorado Boulevard for decades. It's a business that was started by my great-grandfather. That you? Yes. My life told in floats. Here's one with my mom. Are you cold? It's cold out here. No! Thank you. Thanks. I've been meaning to ask you something. What's with not showing anybody your art? It's just not where I want it to be right now. Yeah, I know. It's in your house, collecting dust. That's not what I mean. When... I graduated from art school, I got invited to exhibit my work in a show, and I jumped at the chance. All my work, unveiled for the world to see. And...? It was a disaster. The critics were brutal, my work wasn't ready, and after that, it was really hard for me to get back into it... Especially after my mom passed away. She was my biggest cheerleader. Since then, I've just had a block. Well... Push through. I'm trying. I'm not the Bulldozer. Andy, I didn't enter you into the auction to throw you under the bus. I did it because you're lucky. You're great at something. You have a passion. I never found mine. What about business? Being good at something isn't the same as liking it. To be honest, a big part of the reason this job, and Shanghai in particular, is so important to me is that... I've always been driven to show my dad that I can make a Mark, too. He's a self-made man, no-nonsense, started his business from the ground up. You know, I... Really didn't expect to enjoy this assignment. Sounds like you surprised yourself. I bet that doesn't happen often. You're right... Although it reminds me of one summer in college. I was doing volunteer work, building houses from scratch, and... I still remember this feeling, working with my hands all day, and then, at the end of the day, just... Pure satisfaction. I know exactly what you mean. I had a fantastic night. Me too. I'm becoming a fan of happy chaos... And Christmas, too. Well, I knew there was a heart in there somewhere. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I believe in you, Andy. Thank you. Okay. Time for a fresh start. I haven't skated since I was a kid! I can't believe you talked me into this. Well, this is one Christmas tradition I never skip, even if it is... Not nearly as sunny and warm back home. You're good at this! Stop. So, how's the painting going? It's going. I had a breakthrough, but I have to admit, I'm really nervous about the auction. Just be yourself. Easy for you to say. What do you mean, "easy?" I'm managing a parade float for the first time in my life. Ha! You admit that it's hard! I guess we both have to push through. No! No, no, don't! Too fast! I am so proud of all of you! This looks incredible, and now, we have three days 'til the parade, so we are in the home stretch. So what do you think? We got this, right? Nice! Either it's lack of sleep, or that bear is moving. Compliments of four hydraulic cylinders actuated by valves. Thanks to Cliff, I'm an honorary gearhead. No. What happened? Not sure. Okay, I'm going to have to look at the hydraulic system. That bear's going to have to come down. I'll put it back as soon as I can, but... It's all good. I got this. Just... y'all just keep on decorating. I got it. Bulldozer looks worried? No. No, no. Come on. We got this far. We'll push through. Right. Even with all the pressure, this is my favorite part of the build. I have to agree. 'Cause every year, you get to see a new float finally coming together at the last minute, huh? That's what's so incredible about the Rose Parade. New floats, New Years, new beginnings. Speaking of new beginnings, how are things going with you and Cliff? Me and Cliff? Well, there is no "me and Cliff". You know, he actually came with me to my dad's house for Christmas. - Really? - He did? He did... And it was... It was nice. Aw... At the end of the night, he... He...? He actually told me he believed in me. That's so sweet. I was inspired. Well, like you said, a New Year brings a new beginnings. And possible new romances, new relationships... New weddings... It's a start. My fingers are numb. Tell me about it. Where is Andy? She's getting ready, and then off to the holiday gala tonight. And the art auction, thanks to me. You know, the gala is the biggest party between Christmas and New Year's, and the sort of thing a pretty girl could use a date to. You look beautiful! Stunning. I'll be right back. What? You look amazing. Shouldn't you be at the gala now? I live down the street, and I couldn't drive by without stopping to say thank you, guys, for everything. And dinner is on me tonight. I'll be back to work the late shift. Okay. Now you both go and have fun. "Both"? I just had to grab my jacket. I figured, since I got you into this whole auction mess, I should probably make sure you're not alone. This feels like a date. Why does this feel like a date? Maybe because it is one? Do one thing a day that scares you. No, I'm not scared! I'll be fine! I'm fine. Shall we go? The auction should be starting any minute now. Here, let's have some champagne. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. You're going to be fine. That's easy for you to say. It's starting. All right, now for the highlight of our evening, an auction of artwork from some of Pasadena's best artists, and every dollar goes towards the many wonderful charities and groups funded by the tournament of roses. Our first item, a painting done by Pasadena's Princess of float decorating, Andrea Lindry. That's your dad's place. It looks just like it did the other night! I was inspired. It's beautiful. Our bidding starts at $500. Do I have any bids? Anyone? It's history repeating itself. No, these are just a bunch of stiffs. We just need to prime the pump. $500! Cliff! What are you doing? It's basic sales psychology. Someone will chime in now. We're at $500. Do I hear $1,000? The bid is at $500. Do I hear $1,000? A thousand. $1,100. $1,200. $1,300. $1,500! We're at $1,500. Do I hear $1,600? $2,000! Told ya. That was amazing! You just raised $4,000 for charity. They just needed a little push, thank you. Now, if you're so angry at me, why are you smiling? I'm not smiling. Do you have time in your busy schedule for a dance? Are you serious? Yeah, why not? This is how we do snow in California. You're a good dancer. Got some tricks up my sleeve. Yes, you do. All good. Like all of us, this little fella just needed a little extra support. Guess that MBA didn't push all your construction skills aside. Makes you proud, huh? Normally, when I do my job well, I just see tired faces and papers getting pushed, but... Here, I see something real. Yeah. I think we're going to make our deadline. Yeah, I think I hear the echoes of success. It's almost 8:00. Day shift will be in soon. Cliff, didn't you say you missed Christmas snowball fights back east? Yeah, why? We don't have time for this! I know! Cliff! Mr. Ellsworth! Hi. Sir... Mr. Ellsworth, this is Andy... From sunshine floats. Hello. What is that? Why is the bear's head detached from its body? It's just a minor setback... Cliff, what happened to "ahead of schedule and under-budget"? Sir, we've made terrific headway! You just caught us at a bad moment. It's not nearly as bad as it looks. I'm sure there's a logical reason for all of this. Yes! We just had a little problem with the hydraulics, so we took it apart. It'll be up and running... Hydraulics? When are hydraulics become part of the plan? Well... We thought it would add a special touch. Yes, and up our game. You're nowhere near done, and you decided to reach for the stars? I mean, I was already skeptical about the waterfall, and now this? Ahead of schedule's clearly not happening, and the budget? I don't want to even think about it. Mr. Ellsworth, we have been building floats for years, and I'm very confident we can deliver. Ms. Lindry, I hired your father to oversee this. I didn't hire you. Yes, my father is the best in the business, but given his health, I am doing my best to fill his shoes. I'm sure you had good intentions, but Cliff said you were out of your depth and that this float would be a disaster with you in charge, and it seems he was right. You said that? No! Yes, but... I didn't know what I was talking about. I didn't know you yet. I was just venting. I can't believe you would said that to him. Andy... I'd expect that from art critics, but not from you. You never believed in me. Andy, wait! I should have known better. Hey! Good morning, Christine! What's going on? It's not pretty. A guy in a suit is speaking in low tones to Cliff. Where's Andy? She took off as I was driving in, and she looked pretty upset. Dear. Well, let's find out what's wrong. Look, Mr. Ellsworth, there have been some executive decisions, and if any of them are missteps, then that's all on me. There's been some missteps all right. But the reason this float was on its way to being terrific is Andy. She and everyone else have put their hearts and souls and art into it. Look, it's noble to defend her, but let's finish what we started. Forget the waterfall, forget the hydraulics, and get the bear's head back on... Nothing more. But sir, we have a chance to... And then I think you should head back to Chicago, and when I return, we need to discuss your future at North Lake, and whether you still have one. I understand... And for the record? I've never met anyone who's put more passion and commitment into her work than Andy. Yeah, so if you hear of any jobs at your firm, let me know. Thanks, John. I owe you. Good morning, Mr. Baskers. Looking forward to the parade? Actually, I'm checking out early. I've got to catch a flight back east in a couple of hours. On New Year's eve? But you will miss everything! Yeah. Think I already have, actually. Well, I hope you enjoyed your stay with us here in Pasadena. Yeah, it's been... Surprising. Dad, I'm sorry I let you down. I let everyone down. I disappointed the client. Aw, honey, you're doing the best you can in an impossible situation. That's all you can do. But what if it hurts the company? Honey, companies come and go. My life is my family. Everything else is window-dressing... But when are you going to get back into your passion? Dad... Back into life. You've been living on the sidelines for too long... And... Whatever happened with Cliff? We got into an argument. Crunch week. Squabbles happen. This was no squabble. He's opinionated. He's rude. He's always so sure he's right. I've got a whole list of things. Well, he may be a Bulldozer, but Cliff seems to be a pretty good guy. That's what I thought, too, but I was wrong. Anyway, I am going to pull myself together, and I will see this float through to the end. Sweetheart, all these years building floats... Haven't you realized? New year's isn't just an ending. It's a beginning, too. I love you, dad. I love you, too, sweetheart... So much. Coming! Hey, Emily! Come on in. I'm just getting ready to go back to the warehouse. I thought you should know... Cliff is heading back to Chicago. Well... I mean, what does it matter, right? In the end, it was just business to Cliff anyway. Really? 'Cause it wasn't very good business, the way Cliff took all the blame. What do you mean? After you left, Cliff stood up for you and took responsibility for the whole thing. He did? Yes, and made perfectly clear that he never met anyone who put more passion into their work than you. Just thought you should know. Thank you. Hey... Here to make sure I leave town? My cab will be along any minute. Actually, I'm... Here to apologize. Emily told me everything you did, standing up for me to your boss. I was just telling the truth. Even if that cost you your job? Maybe it's time I found another job where I wasn't constantly having to prove myself... To my dad or... To myself. I'm really sorry, Cliff. It's been a challenging past few weeks. You can say that again. I have an idea, though. I mean, our float, it may be a lost cause, but didn't a wise person once say that every problem is just an opportunity in disguise? Come on, we don't have a lot of time. Okay, team, thank you for holding down the fort. Andy, could I say a few words? Of course! So we could launch an ordinary float, but a wise person once helped me understand that a true artist never settles. We have one last chance for a hail Mary here, and we can do something really special as a team. Hail Mary's my favorite way to win the game. The hydraulics still don't work, and we're not finished decorating, and re-building that bear, we... We're still a few thousand roses short! Am I missing anything? Then we have our work cut out for us. I'll take care of the roses. And... I think I have an idea about how to get us some extra hands. All right! Let's go, team! Go, team! Only six hours 'til the float inspectors come. It's going to be close. Off! Turn it off. Still not working? No, and if we don't get the float working properly, we won't pass inspections, and then there's no parade for us. It just doesn't make any sense. But we just have to keep at it. Hey, Eric! There he is. All right! It's my teammates to the rescue. Looks like you guys brought your friends... And your families! Hey, bro, who needs a hand? Guys, meet my teacher, Ms. Lindry. Hi! The one who was failing you in art class? Well, he may be struggling in class, but he is acing this independent study, and the important thing is, you guys are all here, and we are paying with pizza, so I'll let you put them to work. All right, let's go. Thank you! How's it looking, Christine? We still need more flowers. Cliff, is that you? Let me help you. I got it. I got more in the delivery truck. Where did you find these? I stopped by a few of the other float barns. Even though they're the competition, every team chipped in to help us with their spare roses. The rest, I got special ordered. How did you pay for them? My treat. Seemed like a small price to pay to finish the float. Thank you so much! All right, well, this is definitely enough roses! Yeah, you think? Let's get started. Down to business. Grab those. So these are the pink ones right here? How are the mechanics looking, Lou? We don't have a lot of time. Honestly, I'm stumped. Now, if this would've been a good old diesel engine, I would have had this fixed days ago. I heard you got a big problem. Dad! It's okay. I have a note from my doctor. In fact... I brought my doctor. Figured I'd lend a hand. Thank you for coming! So, mind if I have a look at the patient? Be my guest. Thanks. Cliff! You want to assist? Good news. I put in a couple calls, and the inspectors are going to stop by our float last! This is going to buy us a few extra hours. - That's fantastic! - Yeah. How's it going? Good! Well... You're trying to turn the bear, but also drive it forward. You've got to remember that the momentum of the float is putting stress on this drive chain. No matter how much you try to make it run as designed... It's never going to run smoothly. Give the drive chain some slack, and I bet you'll have no trouble at all. Just needs a little room to do its thing. Yeah, I guess I need to learn to do that. She's a creative spirit, Cliff. She's lucky to have your support. Okay, so, what's the prognosis, dad? Don't ask me. Cliff here figured out the problem. Cliff, we don't have a lot of time. I think I can fix it. Let me give it a try. If that doesn't fix it, I don't know what will. The float inspectors should be here any second. So what do you think? I think it beats a day at the office. I knew you'd see the light. So this is what 20,000 roses look like... Actually, 19,999. Saved one for you. Hello? Are we ready for float inspection? They're here! And here we have the North Lake float, "fishing follies". You ready? Here goes nothing. So consider this our small thank-you for the hours of tireless work. To the float builders and volunteers that make the magic happen! Covered in glue... Sleep-deprived... Sore... This is easily the best New Year's ever. It's almost midnight! Time to break open the champagne! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five four, three, two, one... Happy New Year! What's that? It's the list of New Year's resolutions I was writing for you. It's long! I don't think we need these anymore. Let me see what's on it! We don't need 'em. Happy New Year. Well, one New Year's resolution I do intend to keep? This year, I'm going to take time to stop and smell the roses. And so, as we welcome America's New Year celebration, the Rose Parade, dawning with flowers and a promise of happiness and hope in the year ahead, and remember, as we all enjoy the biggest single floral display in the world, let us take time to wish happy New Year to all of those, including our family and friends. Does that give you goosebumps, or what? Now, this is the way to watch the Rose Parade! I just hope Christine's enjoying driving the float. I mean, she did say her New Year's resolution was to try new things. Well, Eric will be watching every turn. There it is! Nice work, everyone! Cliff? What can I say? I was wrong. You took the initiative, made an executive decision, you got great results. Just the executive I need to head up the company's new Shanghai office. Congratulations. I'd be honored, sir, but... Actually, I'm going to be staying in Pasadena. You see, there's a gallery that wants to show some of my work, and sunshine floats sure could use a new co-manager who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. And I could use a change of pace. Don't worry. We'll give you a deal on next year's float. Well, best to you both. Here's to new beginnings. New beginnings... I couldn't have said it better myself.
