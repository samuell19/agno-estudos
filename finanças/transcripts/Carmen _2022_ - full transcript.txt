Carmen, my heart. These men. They weren't the first and they won't be the last. Different faces. Different shapes and sizes. But they are always the same man. One man. His eyes are sad but produce no tears. He is parched and cold like the desert in the night. His heart pumps sand through his veins, not blood. He yearns for the tears of our eyes. The milk from our breasts. The blood of our womanhood. Anything, that he might taste life again. He won't. He can't. Where is she? Where is she?! You have loved me, as I loved my mother. Now it is time for you to leave me. Time for you to fly. Go to the City of Angels, to La Sombra Poderosa. And find Masilda. If you are my heart, then she is my spine. She will be yours as well. My precious Carmen... inside you, you carry my blood, my milk, my tears. Take them to my Masilda. Both of you, share them. Feast on me. And I will live inside you forever. Loving. Dancing. Laughing. Hey! Do it. You're the only one that keeps me out of trouble. - Is that a beer for me? Thank you. - What? Oh, fuck you! -You like that? -Ha! -Hey. -Hey. How are ya? Okay. -You look like you could use a beer. -I'll take the Pepsi. -Sure. -Thanks. -Is there anything I can do to help? -No, I'm good. Thanks. Hey, John. Stop. Not now. Hey, handsome. Can I get you a beer? No? Oh, okay. How about I just stand here and rub my boobs against your arm-- -She's just looking for attention. -She could get it from her husband. -You should mind your own business. -You are my business. It's an unfortunate side effect of being my little brother. Mm-hm. -Have you said hello to Jay yet? -Uh... -No. Hi. -Come on. Hey. How're you doing? - Okay. - Thanks for coming. - Hey, Marie. - Hey. Hi, Jay. How are you? He's good. Always eager to see you. -Last time, was it Thanksgiving? -Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, it was. And we all got so hammered. Did we? I guess so. -It was so funny. Remember? -Yeah. I remember Aidan played this song on his guitar. Oh, he's always playing some song on his guitar. I should get back. -Aidan... -I don't want this stuff to burn.

I'm oh so sorry, but he has to cancel tonight's lonely concert. 'Cause unless you know something I don't, strumming that guitar isn't gonna pay the mortgage. There it is. Yeah, nice. If you're ever gonna get a job, you'll need to meet more people than me. You know how many jobs there are in this town? One. So tonight, you show them how good you are and maybe we won't have to move to the Motel 6. Wait up, asshole. What's your name? Ramon. Are you Mexican, Ramon? Yes, yes. Francisco is my wife's cousin.

Got home from Afghan last August. - How many tours? - Uh, two. - I'm volunteering the next. - Damn. -Yeah. -Welcome home, son. -I appreciate your service. -Thank you. We need more guys like you here. Wait until you see how it feels to guard your country from your own backyard. All right, listen up. We've had two or three scout sightings just west of Puerto Palomas, so maybe keep an extra eye out there. You guys are out here on your own dime. Helping us do our jobs. We appreciate it. The country appreciates it. You guys know the drill. You put eyeballs on anybody, you call it into base. - Base calls Border Patrol. - All right. Weapons check! So anyone learned Spanish yet? What for? If we're hunting Mexicans, someone ought to speak Spanish. Why? You know how to speak deer? What the hell? You seeing this? Call it in. Mike. Either the beaners left it here, or someone left it for them for when they cross. Mike. Mike. Get back in the truck and call it in. There's nobody here! Mike, stop! Put the gun down! Got him. I got him! Hey! Hey! Mike! - Fuck! - Mike, Mike, Mike, stop, Mike! Mike! Fuck! No! Mike, let her go! Okay. Take these. Here. Come here. Thank you. Here you go. Water, water. Wait, wait, wait. Go. Go. Quickly, okay? Don't fucking move, all right? I will fucking shoot you, I swear to God. You wanna say good night? You wanna say good night? That's fine. Hey. Todo bueno. Hey! Hey! Get out of the truck. You know where you're going? North. Take the next right! Get in. Christ, Mike. You knew him? Where you from? El Paso. Well, this is damning. Of course I fucking knew him. Get an APB out on a blue '88 Chevy. That man you shot. Was he your friend? You speak English good. Well. I speak English well. His name was Mike. Are you a soldier? Mm-hm. Marine. My name is Carmen. Do you have a name, Marine? Hello, sir. What's your name, sir? Angel. And yours? Carmen. -And where are we going, Carmen? -To your city. The City of Angels. I've never said no to an adventure. Me neither. My name's Aidan. Angel. This is my friend Pablo. He is going to Los Angeles and he offered to take us. Are you sure? Yes. We've taken you far enough. No, it's too much. Please. Thank you. Be careful, Carmen. Always remember that the thing you're running from is almost always the thing you are running toward. Thank you. Thank you. So how long have you guys been together? Long enough. Long enough? Okay. Okay. I wouldn't do that. My boyfriend gets jealous. And violent. Why don't you get rid of Blondie and come with me? Because he's a man, and you're a musician. -Pablo. -Yo. I understand Spanish. It's all good, man. Let's hit the road. You think I'm a man? Hm? This is it. There you are. -Sure you don't wanna come in? -No, I should keep moving. What are you gonna do? Hide. Figure it out. Anyway, I... I'm glad you made it. You should lay low for a while. She's here, they're here. Make way for her. She is from nowhere in particular, but she knows where she comes from and she knows where she is going. Clear the way for this woman. Her strength is her root, her story. What holds her when she loses her way, when she doesn't know where to go. Clear the way for her strength. The strength of her blood. The strength of her mother, of her grandmother, of the soil fighting to emerge. Throw me a chance, and chance will throw you back to me. Clear the way for this woman. Majestic in her domains. She is from nowhere in particular, but she knows where she comes from and she knows where she is going. Clear the way for this woman. Her story is her root. What holds her when she loses her way, when she doesn't know where to go. Clear the way for her strength. The strength of her blood. The strength of her mother, of her grandmother, of the soil fighting to emerge. Throw me a chance, and chance will bring you back to me. Clear the way for this woman. Come and rest on me. Put your life on pause. Rest in my lap. Come and rest on my chest. Life is a mystery that no one can solve. What's important is to know who you are and where you want to go. What's important is to know who you are and where you want to go. -Excuse me. -What can I get you? I'm looking for Masilda. To drink. What can I get you to drink? Uh... tequila. Tequila, hm? You? Hey. -Hm? -Casper the Ghost, what can I get you? Uh, just a Pepsi. -A Pepsi? -Yeah.

I... I don't know. Maybe. Carmen? Carmen, is that you? Holy Mary! My God, I can't believe it. You've got your mother's eyes. Like burning coals. They killed her. Damn those sons of bitches. My mom told me you were like sisters. Yes. Sisters of life and sisters of death. I wanted to ask you if I could stay here for a night or two? Of course. Of course, sweetheart. Can I give you a hug? Oh, Carmencita. Carmencita, little girl. Who is this? This my friend Aidan. -Ah. Welcome, Aidan. -Thank you, ma'am. Oh, he has manners. The quiet ones with the manners always have the big pee pees. Masilda, stop. See what I have to put up with? He looks like he has a good pee pee, doesn't he? What'd she say? She say you have potential. Yes, you have lots of potential. Lots of potential. It's true. I'm sure he's hungry too. - Are you hungry, huh? - Yeah, sure. Give him something to eat. Gabrielle gonna give you something. Go with her. Get some food. Yeah. A pleasure to meet you. Oh, my pleasure. My pleasure. For me a pleasure, too, darling. Great. Look, he look like Anthony Hopkins. If I was 30 years younger, I'd go: Like a platter of chilaquiles. - Come. - Mm-hm. No, no, no. It's okay. Shh. It's the first time you enter my home. Let me do it. In Sevilla, in my family, we do it like this. These feet know how to dance, right? They're butterflies. Do you know if there's a telephone booth anywhere I could use? A telephone booth? Yeah, you know, like a pay phone. I have to make a call. Yeah, I didn't think you were gonna change into a cape and tights. You can use mine. I won't listen. No, it's, uh... it's private. Use the house phone. There's one on the podium. No, I just need a pay phone. I don't think they exist anymore. But check the old bodega. Think I saw one at the back. It's okay. Don't worry. Thanks. I, uh... I have to call my sister. I didn't ask. Hello? Aidan, is that you? You have to tell me because we don't know if you're... Is it you? It's me. Oh, Thank God. Are you okay? I don't know what they told you, but it's... It's not... Stop. I just wanna know if you're okay. I'm okay. Jules-- The bullet they found was... They said that... Just tell me it was an accident, Aidan. Tell Nancy I'm sorry. And Sarah. I gotta go. Jules-- Don't tell me where you are. I don't wanna know. I can't come back. I'm not coming back. Jules... you took good care of me. I love you. Yeah. I love you too. Aidan? Here we are. It's not everything, but you're gonna be comfortable. Thanks. I thank you very much to take care of Carmen. She's tough, but she's also frail, you know? So are you. Right, sweetheart? Uh... Anyway, my heart and my house are both full today. Sweet dreams. Sorry. I didn't see you. You do it beautifully, Carmen. Precious. I don't dance like her. You don't need to. Everyone dances how they feel. That's how it's supposed to be. Look at yourself. You're beautiful. Everything you're looking for is here. Inside you, everything is here. Don't doubt it. Oh, my little girl. Get it out. Get it out. Don't torture yourself anymore. Get it out and don't torture yourself anymore. She is here with us. I miss her. She is here with us. She is here, feel her. Everything is wrong. I don't know what I'm doing here. -You're alive. -Why am I here and not her? You're alive. And you're looking for yourself, and that is already a gift. Don't worry about anything else. She will always be with us. Always. Carmen. Dance. Dance, because that is what she made you for. To dance. Dance. Dancing will heal you. Don't worry about anything. For her. Dance for her and for you. Look. Do you feel it? Can you feel her here? Your hands are cold. Cold hands and warm heart. Why didn't she tell me about this place? Why did she leave? She needed to be with your grandmother. And then with you. She sacrificed herself for both of you, but... you have to make sure it was worth it. Don't torture yourself anymore. You have to be free. Beautiful Carmen. Let's move our skirts. And let's dance. And let's sing. That's what we were born for. We built this place together, your mother and I. We dreamt of every corner. We would stay up late, smoking and drinking. Dreaming. This place is your home. You can always come here, whenever you want. Always. She'll be waiting for you because she is here in your heart. She is in both of our hearts. Why do you think we named the club La Sombra Poderosa? Because Zilah means "shadow" and Masilda means "strong." Strong shadow. -Dance for me here, okay? -Here? Yes. I can even change the name if you want. I can name it El Poema Poderoso. Because Carmen means "poem." And you're the beautiful poem that she wrote. -Good to see you. -You too. How you been? Yeah, I've been better. Have you seen Jay lately? Yeah. Yeah, we had him over. He's, uh... He's the same. -Shit. -Yeah. They called me. And? And I said it didn't sound like you. What can I do? I need cash. You know I wish I could. Fuck. You know I'm fucked, man. I... And what do you mean, you wish you could? I... Aidan. Every Friday, there's a fight. Cash prize. -How much? -Over 10 G's. Could be more. Three rounds. No gloves. You come throw down, pot's gonna get big. Why's that? 'Cause you're a white boy.
