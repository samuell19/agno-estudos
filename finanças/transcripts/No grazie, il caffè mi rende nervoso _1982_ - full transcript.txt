Good morning, Mr. Giuffrida. Good morning. Buy the airplane. No. For your son! Have the advantage, have a lighter. Buy these handkerchiefs, 1,000 lire! - No, I already have some. Buy them, boss! They're good. Actually, I don't need them. Doctor, do you like the bell? It's nice, but I don't need it. Only 1,000 lire. I already have one. You don't want it, do you? I have an item for your wife. I bought it last week. Help the unemployed, only 1,000 lire. You already have it. Doctor, I also have Batman! Batman? No! Only 1,000 lire! - I've got one! Make twins. Take it, only 1,000 lire. Let me go, it's green! One moment! Are you in a hurry? I don't have it. I don't have the hourglass! These are the first arrivals. Take it, 1,000 lire. Thank you! Good day. - Go to work! - You go! I get it, it's green. Scoundrels! They drive through the red. Stop! Lets go, Sandokan. - They try and run us over. - Be careful! What would I have done without my dog? Scoundrels! This story will end soon! I know what to do. TENDA THEATRE TENT Mr. Giuffrida, the death announcements. Mortuary announcements! Okay, it's a job like any other. 1ST NEW NAPOLI FESTIVAL It doesn't write anymore. - Mr. Giuffrida, mail for you. - I'm here. - Where are you standing? Why don't you talk? - I'm here 'Ten-Tenths'. - Ah. Why did they hire you as a postman? My family has a great tradition to honour. Really? Were they all postmen for "Il Mattino News"? No, all they're blind. - Now I have to finish my rounds. - Ten-Tenths, tell me.. - Why do they call you that? - I'm missing 10 tenths of my sight! Mr. Giuffrida, that was not the question you wanted to ask me. - No. - I know what you want to know, but don't worry. Feel free to speak. Please, ask! You can express any thought, but have the courage to say it! - I wanted to ask you ... - If I was born blind? ... or did I become blind. True? - Yes. I used to see us before. I still remember the sunlight ... ... the blue waves of the sea, the color of the wheat ... ... and my mother's smiling face as I accompanied her ... ... with a wheelchair, in front of Our Lady of Lourdes. As soon as we arrived in front of the Madonna, there were so many people ... ... and everyone prayed harder, harder and harder! At one point I didn't see anything anymore. I started shouting: "I can't see! I can't see!" And all around: "Miracle! Miracle!" I'm used to it now, so it's no longer a problem. It is as if all of my senses have suddenly awakened. Now I can do things that I couldn't do when I could see. (Song from speaker) "Come on, come on! Come on, come on!" "Funicular, funicular!" "Come on, come on! Come on, let's go! Funiculì, funiculà!" - There was an accident at the Tenda Theater. - What happened? The scaffolding assembled for the New Napoli Festival collapsed. - They say they want to stop the Festival. - That's crazy! - I'll say. Some think it wasn't an accident. Be ready. - What time did it happen? - Half an hour ago. - Let's go! - Michele, is something wrong? - No. Nothing. - Strange, there seems to be. - No. - Were there any deaths? - No, only three wounded. Lucky, I won't have to make an announcement for them! - Do you enjoy doing the obituaries? - It's a job like any other. Michele! This postcard of Old Naples is beautiful! In my opinion it's from the 1930's. Michele, look! In my opinion it dates back to 1920, because Via Petrarca ... - No! Look what it says. - Behind? - Yes! "The donkey is injured, but not dead. Naples must not change." "Whoever performs at the Festival will be killed, fear makes 90 ..." "We are from Napoli. Signed, Funiculì Funiculà." Those who perform at the Festival will be killed. What is "Funiculì Funiculà"? - It's a famous song. - Oh really? That's very strange.... ..at the Tenda Theater, loud music was coming out of the speakers. - Do you know that song? - Yes. - Sing it. - Here? - Yes. - No, I'm embarrassed. - Do you know "Funiculì Funiculà"? - I do. - Will you sing it? - Why? - Please! (sings) "Come on, come on! Come on, let's go!" Thank you. Michele, that is the same song from the Tenda Theatre. - What's strange? - Nothing. But the postcard with the warning is signed "Funiculì Funiculà" ... ... and at the Tenda Theater, after the scaffold collapsed, that song was playing. It wasn't an accident, it was sabotage. Michele, take the postcard to the boss. Lisa, similar things arrive here every day. Don't panic! It might be important. Take it to the boss. The boss could write a novel with something like this! - I want peace and quiet ... - Come on! - Look what I do with it! - Do as you like! - Don't get involved! > Who is it? > Is it you, Mr. Michele? - Yes, Mrs. Rosa! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Dad? - Today... he is more agitated than usual. He told me that I have no right to keep the door locked ... ... and that I'm his jailer, but it's not my fault. - I am sorry. - Be patient, there's no alternative. I'll open the door for you. - Did you lock that door too? - Sure. I thought it was the lady upstairs ringing. - Do you remember what your father did the other day? - Thanks. - You're welcome. Sorry. You're welcome. Dad! I know you are not sleeping. You should have come earlier, I've been dead for three hours. Still the same old story! Open your eyes. - I brought you the cannoli. - I do not like them. Do you want to keep your eyes closed? The dead have their eyes closed. I haven't been resurrected. Mrs. Rosa said you are upset. I want to go out, I can't always stay locked in here. I miss the air, the sun! I want to play with my friends. Dad, I'm not letting you out because you are dangerous. You don't understand anything. Every year I wrote a song for the Piedigrotta festival. I wrote it and they stole it. When I protested, they replied ... ... "Who do you think you are? A fisherman, or a musician?" So I reminded them of the feast of Piedigrotta. Do you remember that party? You loved it too. The lights, the food, the fires by the sea ... ... the floats that passed by the church! You were happy as we went past the jury with our boat ... ... I was singing and playing the mandolin. Seven times I won the first prize! Naples must be like this again. These things are part of the past and you know it. I know! Michele, I want to show you something. Look. These are my burial robes. - I want you to come and dress me. - Think about your health! - Don't always think about death. - What else do I have to think about? Death did not come today, but it will surely come tomorrow and I must be ready. - You need to come more often. - I come every day, and then there's Rosa. Rosa? I only have you and when I don't see you I feel like I'm dying! Haha! You believed it! What a fool! I am a great actor! The words and music of this song ... ... are from the maestro Antonio Giuffrida! Gentlemen, "Fragolella, fragolè"! What is this poster? Yes, I sent you a negative of a postcard. Develop it. Then print it in the center of the news page. Be careful, it's torn. But you must able to read every word. Giuffrida! Why didn't you bring the postcard you received? - Miss Sole had to do it. - I didn't want to publish it! Do you decide what the newspaper should publish? - It seemed exaggerated to me! - Did you title it as I told you? "The Festival Continues" "One of our journalists is on the trail of Funiculì Funiculà." Giuffrida ... where are you? He will bring you the article. No, boss! We can't believe a postcard! You have been threatened by a bunch of clams! - That was a joke. - And this? - This is serious. Wait a minute. Yes, typography. Now you go out that door and try to learn ... ... as much as possible about this story. Bring me an article about anything. Maybe get killed! But try to understand, I have to fill in these columns of newspaper. Yes, it's Torre. - And? - Are you happy? I said no! So why did you take the postcard to the boss? Don't be a hypocrite! You will be happy to have your name on the front page. Do I look happy to you? - Do you want a coffee? - No thanks. Coffee makes me nervous. What are you afraid of? There is no reason to worry. - What if there really is a criminal? - If it isn't, there's no danger. - If there is, you can help avoid another mishap. - What if it happens to me? - No! Now go away and let's not talk about it anymore. - The more we talk about it, the worse it is! - Ugh! Hello? Nicola? Nicola, I'm going to shoot you! I'm sorry but your going to disappear. You must die! Nicola! Nicola. Nicola. Hello? Hel... Signoriello house? No, wrong number, lady. I was looking for Nicola. I had to tell her something. No. Excuse me. DOORBELL RINGS - Hi Michele. - Hi Lisa. Sorry I didn't warn you, I just happened to be passing by. - Excuse my present state. - Don't worry. I love you that way too. - Well? - What? - Have you finished the article? I'll finish in two minutes. I'm missing a ... - I don't know how to conclude. - Have you had something to eat? - Are you done? - I haven't written anything yet. Two minutes. What did you decide about the Tenda Theater? Are you going there? The dress rehearsal is tonight. You can talk to the participants. - If you want, let's go together. - I'm writing this article ... ... just to avoid being fired. - I'm not suited for these things. - Okay, are you done? I'll finish in two minutes. - You've been saying that for an hour! - You keep interrupting me all the time. - I need two full minutes. - Two minutes! - Two minutes have passed. - Okay, it doesn't get better than that. Let me see. "Please can whoever made this rather lively gesture ..." "... try not to do it again". Michele! The problem isn't that you can't write, but that you don't want to. - You're afraid to write the truth. - It's not true. - I was trying to be careful. - Careful? Look here! - After all, we don't know anything yet ... - Are you touching me? No, it was the chair and I didn't get this far. Michele! Did you get offended? I was joking. Are you really offended? It was a joke! Come on, come on! Sorry! Are you hurt? Look! What did you throw in my throat? - It was just popcorn. - It looked like a button. Now you have to guess a sentence that I say. - Is this dangerous? - No! Nothing will happen. INCOMPRENSIBLE WORDS What did I say? INCOMPRENSIBLE WORDS No! I said "a thousand little killers". Try it yourself. INCOMPRENSIBLE WORDS Let's go to the Tenda Theater. Lisa! - Please! - One moment. Help me! Look at state I'm in! You could have had someone help you! What are you doing with these posters? It's not your job! You avoid doing your job. Don't start. I can't interview James Senese. What do I ask him? They're rehearsing. They're busy. That's just an excuse. - Here. - What's this? - I've prepared some questions. - I wanted to interview him. I'll give them to you. - No... It is a good time. James Senese! - Michele wants to interview you, can he go up? - If it's convenient. Yes, but let's hurry up. We have to rehearse. Oh! Go! SENESE IMITATES THE DRUM BEAT No! The interval must be one and a half measures! Senese. Senese! Wait a moment! Did you understand? James. Senese! Senese! What do you want? Do you want to do the interview? - Hurry up, we have to rehearse. - I don't have a pen, I'll be back later. - He doesn't even have a pen! - I have one. - Here! We will do it now. - I'll ask you the first question. - Did you want to ask the second one? - No. "Why does a character like you remain relegated to singing..." "... within the confines of your dialect? Maybe you should rise above..." "... provincialism to a more Italian outlook." "Are you afraid you won't be able to express yourself clearly?" What do you mean? You're crazy! Is a reporter trying to tell me how to sing? - I've always sung in dialect and I want to continue like this. - OK, OK. All right. I'll ask another question. "You project a normal image of yourself, performing on an empty stage." "A stripped down, barren spectacle." "Do you think your music is so perfect that it compensates for this?" Is this an interview or a insult? - What do you like, music or smoke? - The music. - Well, this is music! All right. So you don't want to answer? No! I answered already. I'll give you another one. "Where does James Senese stand ..." "... on feminism today?" "Have you managed to solve your relationship problems with us women?" You're crazy! I'll break this saxophone over your head! You are stupid! You have to go! Toto, chase this madman away! - Which newspaper are you from? - "Il Mattino". Tell your boss to send another reporter. Go away! I told you to go away! Let's get back to rehearsing! - Michele! - It's always your fault, I didn't even want to come! You could have read the questions first and then asked them a different way. (from the speaker) "Friends, good evening!" "The donkey is injured, but it's not dead!" "I already warned you. Naples must not change!" "So whoever performs at the Festival.. dies!" Farewell James Senese. "I sentence you to death. You played the wrong song!" 'FUNICULI FUNICULA' PLAYS FROM THE SPEAKER Guys, who playing these jokes? Who put this song on? Let us rehearse. James, listen to me. We should leave. Too many strange things are happening. The only thing to take seriously is performing at the concert. We have to rehearse. - You are stubborn! - What do you say? Get your instruments. DISTURBING DEATH THREATS MADE TO J SENESE Other festival participants under Police protection The train arrived late. There's no danger. I came directly to the hotel. All right, pass me to Dad. Dad! It's all right, don't worry. The Police are here, the detectives are guards. Don't worry. I'll do the Festival and leave. I have to be the bait, the decoy. The decoy ... No, I'm not doing the trick! It is not dangerous. So why do you say ... Look, It's like a bird that sees his reflection in the mirror. ...the Police shoot the mirror, and when the bird hears the noise he takes... What? Why would they shoot a bird? Don't worry, dad. I'm fine, there's the Commissioner and two big guards. Hey, I'm not Khrushchev. I said "big" guards, not "red" guards! I'm fine, really. Don't worry, I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. - It was my father. - Is he concerned? You are the only one who can help us unmask the maniac. Rest assured, everything is under control. You are occupying this room under a false name. Did you hear that? Right by the window. There was ... just a ... a kind of rustling. It's probably a bird. A lark! - Fusco, take a look outside. - You are so calm. I heard it clearly. Mr. Troisi, you will always be followed by one of my men. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Inspector. - I'll sleep like a baby. - I hope everything goes well. I'm leaving you with my men. This is Amaniera. - Maniera?? - Amaniera! Go to your place. This is Fusco. Go in your place too. Fusco and Amaniera. I feel calmer now. - You can sleep peacefully. - That's everything! No, now that Fusco and Amaniera are here I... - Okay, I'll sleep like a baby. - Rest assured. And the lark stays outside. I am almost calm. Good night. I am calm. - If you need us, just call us. - Fusco and Amaniera. See you later. I am almost calm. Fusco and Amaniera. I don't feel safe at all. - A fruit juice. - What flavour? - Pear. - What time does Pasam Records open? - They're usually closed. But sometimes I see someone come in from the back. A fruit juice. 600 lire. I'll also take this and a token for the phone. A thousand lire. Thank you. Michele, hello. It's Lisa. Join me immediately at Pasam Records, Via Catanzaro. There is a back door, I'll try to enter. Hurry up. Lisa. Lisa. Shut up! It's me. Come on. You're crazy, are you trying to kill me? - You took ages to get here. - That crate nearly killed me! - Why did you call me? - At the bar across the street I found ... ... the same postcard that arrived at the editorial office. Here I saw some cassettes identical to the one used for the message. - I don't want to know any more of this! - Lower your voice. Someone's coming! You over there, you over there and you with me! He stopped! They went away. Michele, let's go! (muffled) Help! (muffled) Help! (muffled) Fusco! MUFFLED SHOUTING Fusco! Amaniero. Fusco, Amaniero! Mr. Troisi! Everything's OK! I was just testing. - Can you hear me OK from the outside? - Very well. - I faked a strangulation. - Well, we're out here. Thank you. Is it okay in terms of modulation? Hello, Nicola? I'm going to kill you. You can't treat me like that! You must die! Is that still the Signoriello house? Right. Sorry, ma'am. I dialed 7695322. Yes. Oh, only seven ... And Nicola's not there. Then why are you answering? That's OK, stay home. But I have to shoot her. Not you! I don't know you, I don't even know where you live. Nicola is the one I'm trying to contact. I'm not doing this for fun. Yes Ma'am. We're leaving. Are you coming with us? I'll be another ten minutes, I'm tired. If you come with us, we'll be more at ease. Are you still thinking about that madman's message? If he comes, I'll break his head on the wall! Don't worry. - James, let's go. - I'll see you tomorrow at nine o'clock. I've got a headache. I'll be another ten minutes. See you tomorrow. 34. 34. INDISTINCT NOISE Three things dear to Napoli: The sun, pizzas and sfogliatelle pastries. Funiculì Funiculà. URINAL FLUSHING INDISTINCT NOISE LAUGHING NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS Fool! I thought I was going to die! You were scared, right? On stage you played the fool ... ... "If he comes, I'll break his head on the wall!" Look at his face! You must have time to waste. The noises, the footsteps ... Where did you get the knife? You even had a recorded message! That wasn't us. The idea of ​​the joke came to us later. If it hadn't been Franco joking, you might have come to a tragic end. The tragic ending was with this fool! I was going to have a heart attack! - You are crazy. - It was just a joke! - Don't get offended. - I don't normally play these jokes. - Ciao James. See you tomorrow. - See you then. CHUCKLING > Troisi. > Troisi! > Massimo Troisi! > Troisi! > Troisi! - Who is it? > Funiculì Funiculà. - Who? > Funiculì Funiculà. - Funiculì Funiculà, I ... > I'm behind the curtain. > Don't move or you're dead. Traitor! You too have come to do the New Napoli Festival. - What's wrong with the Naples of yesteryear? - They invited me. - You don't have to. - Mr. Funiculi Funicula ... ... they invited me to the Festival and I came. - You did not have to. - Are you behind the curtain? - Yes. I came for you ... ... because you also say that Naples must change. I really like Naples as it was. - They said there was a maniac ... - Maniac? "Maniac" so to speak. They call you that. I said you're just a little nervous ... ... instead they say that you are a maniac. I said there was no need to exaggerate. - I won't do the Festival ... - Bravo! (aloud) I ... - Keep your voice down! In the morning I speak like this to clear my throat. - I don't like ... - Keep your voice down. Mr. Maniac, Funiculì Funiculà, I like the Naples of yesteryear. I swear! I like the sun, the pizza, the mandolin. - But you say that Naples must change. - I didn't say that! In fact I chatted with them about why Napoli had to change. Let's change Mantua, Rovigo ... Those cities are always the same! I went there as a child with my father 10, 15 years ago. I went back now and nothing has changed! Instead of changing Naples, let's change Rovigo! - Change Rovigo! - Lower your voice. - Then you like Naples as it once was. - Sure. There are two big guards outside ... - I'm going to see if they are there, so you run away. - Stop or I'll kill you! I just wanted to get some exercise. If you go to the Festival, you can excercise. Mr. Funiculì Funiculà, I was told to perform the Lark. I heard... and the maniac, the mirror ... - I do what you want! - Good boy. Say you like the sun, the pizza ... our things. - I like the sun, the pizza ... - The mandolin? I like it! If you give me the sun and the pizza ... But if there is no mandolin ... It seems that the sun does not tan and the pizza does not satisfy. - Songs? - For the songs you need the mandolin. - Sun, pizza and mandolin. - What songs do you like? - All. - "Reginella" ... all of them. - Sing "Palomma", it's my favorite. - Do you know her? - "Palomma"! Sings. Am I just singing the beginning, Funicular? Only the first words. (sings) Palomma, Palo ... (sings) Palom ... It's been a long time since ..... what comes immediately after? (sings) Palomma, Pal ... - You said that before. - What comes next? (sings) Palomma, Palomma ... ... who wants to be a son of a sciore ... - You don't know. - I know! - (sings) Palomma, Palomma wants to ... - You didn't convince me. - You came for the Festival and you will be killed. - I didn't. I won't do it! Mr. Funiculì! Mr. Funiculì. Fusco! Fusco! Ammenieri! Maranieri! Fusco! Who is it? I was wrong! Funiculì Funiculà! - Don't kill me! - What are you doing? Are you crazy? - Ah! It is you. - Michele, what's happening to you? I'm very tense these days. Me too. Look what I found out. -Look. James died with his head smashed. -Yep There is a coincidence. Remember the number on the postcard, 90? - "Fear"? - Yes in 'La Smorfia' 90 means fear and James' saxophone had the number 34. - Do you know what 34 means? - No. "The head." James head! Do you understand? For this maniac, La Smorfia numbers have precise meanings. PHONE RINGS - Hello? - Mr. Giuffrida? - Yes - It's Ten-Tenths. I am at pier 25, in front of dock Santa Lucia Nuova. Aaaaahhh! Hello? Hel... - What happened? - Nothing, I have to visit my father. - See you tomorrow. - Are you leaving like this? Michele! Ten-Tenths! - What happened? - Mr. Giuffrida? - Yes, it is. - Why did you yell? - This wretched dog... ... while I was talking to you he dived and dragged me with him. Look at the state I'm in! My glasses should be around here. I can't see them anywhere. - Can't find them? - No. - Did you come by car? - Yes. I called you to ask you to come and get me. Let's go before you get pneumonia. Careful, there is a step. Do you help your master like this? Shame on you! You really have to be ashamed. What is the use of training them? The course costs 5 million. I'd give him 5 million kicks! SHOOTING Mr. Giuffrida! There is a wounded man, come here! Be calm, it's better if you don't get excited. Who are you? What a sweet scent comes from the sea! - Why tonight and not tomorrow. - Who did it? Look how many people are behind you. Everyone asks me who it was. - For me it was them or maybe you. - Me? Tonight I was unlucky. Who are you? Where were you when I was young ... ... and unconcerned about Mum and Dad's tears. - You knew my father well. - I never saw him! - It was ... - Who? It was who? It was beautiful. Manniti di riale... - What? - 'Mannitidiriale' 'Mannitidiriale'? Leave him alone! He's blind! What are you doing here, Fardaglione? "The Rock" knew that "The Dove" was up to no good. And what do you do? Embezzlement or burglary? - Embezzlement or burglary? - Burglary! Embezzlement! I want to know where the "The Dove's" base is. Hurry up and tell me or you'll meet your end will come immediately. My pistol does not forgive easily. - What did this henchman tell you? - Nothing, I don't know anything! This Moroccan spoke to you first and died! What did Fibbia give to Steusa when they opened the tobacco shop? Looks like they gave us fools and kept the gear for themselves. Talk! It's better if you do! Mr. Giuffrida! Speak if you understand what he's talking about! - Why don't you talk if you understand something! - Boss, he's got nothing on him. Talk, or you'll regret it! Who spoke to him before he died? Him! I wasn't there! I was too far away! - Didn't YOU hear what he say? - What he say? He said many things. The tears of his father, his mother ... - The smell of the sea ... - Before he died, what did he say? That he had an unfortunate life and many other things. He also said ... 'Manniti Di Riale' or 'Mannitdiriale', I'm not sure. - It was three separate words. I'm sure. - Give me a cigarette. What are you going to do to him? Leave him alone! What are you doing to him? And then? What? Watch out for the cigarette! Aaahhh! Mr. Giuffrida! Speak! They'll kill you! I only understood 'Manniti Di Riale'! These two are laughing at us. We need "The Specialist". One moment! I saw him at the Pasam Records warehouse. It's not true! Leave me! Surely the dead man gave you something! You know what we are looking for! It's him, boss! Search this traitor's house. Mastino, let's take care of these two. Put them in the car! Ten-Tenths! > Mr. Giuffrida. I've come up with a trick. When they tied me up ... ... I held my breath. Now I'll untie myself and free you. Did you succeed? - No come on! - Give me time. Damn! The trick worked! Come on! - Did he hear? - No. Come on! - I'm here. - Where are you? - This way. Speak freely, a man must express himself. Where are you? - Is there fire here? - Yes. I'll get something to burn your rope. - Leave it! - Ahh! Ten-Tenths, what are you doing? Put that thing down! Leave it! Mr. Giuffrida, Mr. Giuffrida! Lower your voice. - Where are you? - Don't come near me. - Stop. - Don't say that, don't you trust me? I want to free you. Stop! Lower your hands. Ah! - It was him? - No me! Where are you, Mr. Giuffrida? Did I hurt you? - A rope broke. - Now I'll come untie you. No, put the ember down and let's run away. No! - Why are you shouting? - It's Mastino. - Let's run away! - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. You don't scare me with that match! Ten-Tenths, let's run away! You don't trust me, but how would you have done it without me? Commissioner, you must believe me. I don't sleep anymore, I don't eat anymore ... - I cann't do it! - With the safety net ... You tell me about the safety net, you can tell me what you want ... No element, however evil ... Evil indeed! Whatever you say, you won't convince me. You told me to sleep like a baby... ... but I didn't really sleep. - There is no chance ... ... that somebody will try and kill you. - I don;t care! I am master of myself, just as you are master of yourself. If I ask you to do something, you can refuse. - I understand. - So if I'm my own master... You can also tell me ... If I could do it at your place, I would. I would be calm. It would be like a walk on a summer's day. - Is this an example? - Yes. - If you take this example ... ... do you know what I would answer? I would say no... In my opinion Massimo will give up participating in the Festival. It's understandable with what's going on. You are right, but without him the Festival risks cancelling. Commissioner, can you also tell me ... I'll give an example. The Maniac ... - I can't think of an example. - The maniac is not here. If you tell me that the maniac is not there, I say no. It will be fear, it will be what you want ... - It's only a suggestion. - No, it's fear. You make all your assumptions. It's a suggestion, it is fear ... - You can stop at fear. - If there was any danger ... ... I'd be the first to go. - No, Inspector. I understand you. You want to convince me. This is your job and you want to catch the maniac. But try to understand me too. When you say there is no risk ... ... and you ask me to do it, but I answer "no". I'm afraid. I tell you honestly, I'm afraid. - F-E-A-R. - You really don't want to do that? It's not that I just don't want to do it ... I just don't want to do it! Right! Mr. Troisi, on reflection you're right. The maniac could be hiding anywhere, even among those guys. - We must be wary of everyone. - That's why I'm not sleeping... Whatever you say, I won't do it. Guys, I'm sorry. Troisi will not participate in the Festival. I tried to convince him, but to no avail. - Can I talk to him? - He's adamant. - Let me talk to him. - Go. - Massimo, I have an idea. - I don't care. The commissioner also tried, but I always answered "no", right? I don't even want to know what this idea is. - Don't you want to do the Festival? - No We give a press release in which we say that you will not do the Festival. No. "I will not" do the Festival. Exactly. But you make a surprise appearance on stage. First he says I don't, then I go out by surprise? Should I make a surprise that comes out of the hat? - I won't do it. - The surprise is only for the maniac. If he knows you're not attending, he has no reason to kill you. After the show, they will escort you out of Naples. What do you think? - It could be a good idea. - Could be a good idea? Then it might also be a bad idea. "It might be a good idea" I don't like. Commissioner, you speak if you want ... But you are a little ... You said I could sleep like a baby. I'm not blaming you for something ... ... but I thought I could feel comfortable. - Never mind. - Actually it's a good idea. Now it's a good idea. First he said "it could be". We'll keep this thing between us, nothing will happen. Quite right. Nobody will know. Commissioner ... If it stayed between us, it would be fine. But there is a risk that someone will speak. You speak. I first heard him speak. He spoke, I heard him. I don't remember what he was saying. But he spoke. It can happen that someone talks about it. - Nobody has to report this. - Sure. It is not necessary to claim that Troisi will not do the Festival. We can talk about another topic. History, geography ... I have one doubt. It's my duty to inform you. That the maniac could also be among us. Quite right. I'm glad you say this. You're always a little vague. However, you're right. The maniac could be one of you. If you get killed, the inspector will know the maniac is one of us. - So the maniac won't act. - This is also true. "This too" ... Inspector, you are a good person, but ... "Could it be ..." "This too ..." What does "this too" mean? Does that mean "the reverse is also true"? If the maniac was one of you ... I'll make a guess. If I were you, I wouldn't kill Troisi ... ... because the inspector would immediately suspect you two. If you were the maniac ... leave me alone! The inspector is smart. It would be much better to leave Troisi alone. I come out by surprise and walk away. "A NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN" (MODEST MUSSORGSKY) PLAYS Michele, what are you doing here? How did you dress? - Why didn't you tell me you were coming? - I'll explain. - How long are you going to talk? - You're right. - Sit down! - Stop it! - OK, answer! I thought the maniac might hang out at a place like this. And your hair, the suit, the shoes? I dressed like this to blend in with the others. - Why are you here? - I've been looking for you all day. Michele, look at that man. The one on the door. He was at the Pasam bar and was in a photo of James just before his death. - Leave it alone, please. - No, let's go! Lisa! For once in your life, listen to me! We shouldn't interfere. - Do you want to back off now? - What do you want to do? I need to talk to that man, I think he's involved. Come on! Hey! Leave me! - Ah! - Eh! I never imagined we would see each other again. But this time it will end differently. He only told me 'Manniti Di Riale' and he didn't give me anything! - I swear to you! - Thank God I can't kill you. What is this story and what do you want from us? He knows what I'm talking about. - Look how well Giuffrida does! - Leave me! What a pity this meeting is so unpleasant, or I would give you more attention. - But that stinker has something that belongs to us. - No! You have 24 hours to give us what the dead man gave you. Calm down! We could be friendly, but you're stubborn. So to encourage you, we're gonna keep her. - No! I have nothing to do with it! - Leave her alone! You disgust me! - Oh sorry! - Look before you spit! You say "you disgust me", you spit and hit me! - But I ... - Enough! She comes with us! - No! - Here we go! Michele! Help, Michele! You only have 24 hours, remember that. Only 24 hours. Hello? Nicola, you can't treat me like that! You deserve to be shot! You must die! I see.... Signoriello house.... Lady, what can I do? It's not my fault. No, I checked the number and it's right. Mr. Giuffrida, I have news for you! - He's not here, let's go. - I'm here. - Ah, you're here! - Someone called for you at the bar and I answered. - Who called? I don't know, he spoke with a strange accent. He said: "Lisa, 38 Imbriani Street, under the staircase. 7693381." I don't think you understood anything. I made the guy from the bar write down everything. Sandokan, give me the note. Look. Read it. (voice disguised) Hello. We know that at 38 lmbriani Street... ... you hold a girl prisoner. Don't you dare ... What? Signoriello House? No, ma'am. I was wrong, sorry. (voice in disguise) Hello. I know you are keeping a girl at 38 lmbriani Street. If you've touched her ... If you've even touched a hair, your life is worth nothing! What? If I come there and can't find the girl, I'll kill you! - I'll kill you! - He's crazy! I'm coming. Leave her alone or I'll tear you apart! He's crazy. Excuse me, didn't you go to the nuns' school? - Yes, I was in elementary school. - Franco Giuffrida! - No, Michele Giuffrida. - You haven't changed at all. Who am I? - Ciccone? - No, Merolla. Do not you remember? We were classmates. Many years have passed. - It's been almost 15 years. - Let's go have a drink! No, I have to do something ... I'm in a hurry. See you after so many years and you don't want to be with me for a while? - Don't worry, I'll buy! - That's not it, I have to do something important. Even as a child you were a bit proud. This is not pride, it is very serious. Don't have time for a coffee? I have to go free a girl who has been kidnapped. You haven't changed! Even as a child you used to like telling the nuns stories. But I'm pleased to see you. Actually, do you know what I was doing? I've nothing to do. Let's take a walk together. - We'll have a reunion! - It is not possible. - It's a very delicate thing. - Tell those who don't know you! You're still the same! Even among the nuns, you liked to play pranks. Always the same. You're still the same! MUFFLED SOUNDS Keep calm. Do you know where they took the girl? INCOMPRENSIBLE WORDS - Where did they take the girl? INCOMPRENSIBLE WORDS - Where did they take the girl? INCOMPRENSIBLE WORDS I get it. Wait there. Giuffrida, you were wrong to come here. Hands up! Your time has come. No, Mastino. - You won't shoot. - Stay back! - Come on, give me the gun. - Stay back! - Don't you have a mother waiting at home for you? - Yes. - You don't want me to suffer, do you? - No. If you shoot me, your mother will cry and despair. You'll come home tonight and she'll ask you what you did today. - And you tell her you killed a man. - No! And she cries and despairs! You will not shoot. Give me the gun, Mastiff. - Hands up! - No. Giuffrida, give me the gun. You will not shoot. - No, I'll shoot. - You won't shoot! - I'll shoot instead. - Do you have a mum waiting for you? No, I only have my father. If you shoot me, your father cries and despairs. Do you want to make him despair? When you come home tonight your Father will ask you what you did today. Do you want to tell him you killed a man? Your father will cry and despair. Do you want to make him die? No! Give me the gun. Giuffrida, give me the gun. Hands up! - No, Mastiff. You will not shoot. - I'll shoot! - Do you want to kill your mother? - No! If you shoot me, it's like you're shooting her. You'll break her heart! - Shit! - That's enough! Hands up! - You won't shoot. - Don't deceive me! Do you have a mother or father waiting for you? I only have one aunt and she doesn't care about me. Go! Good morning, I would like the "Il Mattino" Newspaper. I'm not doing the Festival anymore. "Troisi won't do the Festival". I came for this alone. I can walk amongst people. - I read it in the paper. - The maniac can't do anything to me. If I'd done the Festival, he would have killed me. But I didn't. I'm alone, do you see anyone? I came all the way here. "He won't do the Festival." (sings) Palomma your mother calls you.... It's a good song, right? It is my favourite. I like music, words ... - Beautiful.. beautiful. - The whole thing. "He won't do the Festival." I'm alone without ... goodbye. 'FUNICULI FUNICULA' SONG PLAYS (Triosi Won't Do The Festival) > What's going on? What is this confusion? > Go away! They killed Massimo Troisi! He's got pizza in his mouth! MASSIMO TRIOSI ASSASSINATED Important news about Mr. Troisi. Please contact me at the following address. Hotel Raphael - Camera 18, Vicolo Fondo 78 CLOCK STRIKES Did I scare you? It's my favourite joke. Keep still, move and you're dead! Hey, cool it. You shouldn't play with guns. I know why you're here. We've met each other a lot lately. But it's not the way you think. This is a misunderstanding. Don't move! Or I'll shoot! It's only my business card. Kim Norton, General Manager and organizer of shows aboard the Naples Navy. I don't believe one word of it. Stand up and put your hands over your head. You can explain it to Commissioner Barra. It won't help. I've aleady told him. The night they killed James Senese, I was with his manager. You can phone him. He will confirm it. Ah! So you're buddies! I only came to Naples only to hire the Festival Nuova Napoli. I've nothing to do with all that killing. And that man Mastino. He used the Festival as a front. He was illegally dealing. I see. But you were there when they took me. Yes, and it was only by chance that I found out where you were being held. And I informed the paper, the Mattino. I understand. Sorry I was wrong. Hey let me give you some advice. Don't bother him. Give up the whole thing. She's really stupid! She believes everything that's said to her. Nicola, you can't treat me like that. A gunshot ... Nicola! Don't move! I'll make you disappear! You deserve a bullet. You must die! I have to kill you! Hello? You're Nicola, right? Then you have to die! What now? Madam Signoriello, why didn't you answer instead? - Miss, where are you going? - I'm looking for Mr. Giuffrida. He's not home at this time. He's in his studio. - In his studio? - Do you see that gate? Go down the stairs and enter the room at the end of the corridor. - Can you go and call him? - No, I have to stay here. If you want to talk to him, go downstairs. Go ahead. Go down. Michele! Michele! MUSIC PLAYS Michele! Come out, I have him at gunpoint! Lisa. Help me! Help me, Lisa! Help me. How could you fool me like that? How stupid! Now I understand. You weren't in the office with Massimo. I told you everything! And you killed him. Why? Michele, why? The same face of Senese and Troisi! "I'm on the trail of the maniac. I understand everything." Instead you didn't understand anything. I've always made fun of you. No! Not her! Lisa no! You always say so. "Senese no, Troisi no." But it is necessary. They don't understand us, they laugh. New Naples, everything has to change. But why? Coffee, pizza, mandolin. They are pure things, they never hurt anyone. But no! New Naples, everything must change! The sun sucks, the sea sucks, Piedigrotta sucks! Lisa must die! I didn't want to do it. It's his fault, I didn't want to do it. Shut up! Shut up! Don't apologize. It's not worth it. Now let's have some fun. Dad! Don't pretend you're dead. Yes! Sing the songs from my childhood. (sings) Strawberry, strawberries'. Pulcinella, Vesuvius no longer smokes! But we have to make it smoke. How do we do it? I'll handle that.
