I'LL BE ALONE AFTER MIDNIGHT CALENDAR SULFURIC ACID Members of the jury, answer "no" to every question asked for, if the defendant is sentenced, it sets a dangerous precedent... for those poor souls who commit crimes of passion.

Where do you think you are, in a cargo hold? Do you hear me? - I need to leave. - First I need to identify you. Since your colleague hasn't returned, maybe you could call one of my friends.

The Nurseryman. The Fisherman. Gentlemen, I'm delighted to meet you. I'll introduce myself. Monique Argilliers. Married. Twenty-five years old. Without profession. Obliged to commit adultery. I'm in a hurry. I'm taking the 1:45 train. Then you're already eliminated. To get revenge, I've decided to spend the night with one of you. The night, you hear? The whole night. I organized my evening. I allotted you exactly 72 minutes and now you just dismiss me? Yes, exactly. - It's a swindle! - Have some champagne before you leave. No, I'm taking the 1:45 train. One down! - No! - No more room! Calm down, gents. It's just the phone. Is that you, Monique? No, it's not the police chief. It's Michel. Poor guy! What did you do? How awful! Of course I'll come. Are you alone? Hello? She hung up. Stay here, please. If you'll excuse me, I need to go out for a few minutes. Trying to run off? We won't fall for such tricks. Madam, I beg you, please don't leave. You're mistaken. I've no intention of "running off." One of my friends, held at the police station, needs me to vouch for him. I'll be right back. - What proves you'll be back? - I give you my word. - That's not enough. - What proof do you need? We'll go with you. It's safer. I can't. I left without authorization. You'll stay and guard the house. Shall we go? No. Think about it. It's not very proper. Don't worry. We'll behave ourselves. - Fine, if you insist. - Off we go! You, no crazy driving. I'm on a bike. As you say. Madam, I have so much to tell you. Madam, listen to me, please. - Clear out. You're all I can see. - What did you say? Clear out! You're blocking my view of madam. - What? - Clear out! Now I can see her. I feel like I'm escorting the First Lady's carriage. No, buddy, we're not stopping. Make way for Love! Never heard that before, right? Ever heard that before? Ever - You crazy kids! Open the window! Open this window. We'd better open it before he breaks it. Don't be selfish, guys. Give somebody else a chance. Step on it, buddy! And away we go. Enough! Are you coming in? No way. That's no place for us. Suit yourselves. - I'm here for Michel - - Monique! - There you are! - It was nice of you to come. I see you've made some friends! Stop it. - Are those ladies your accomplices? - Monique. Did you ask me here so you could introduce me? I don't know those women. We have the info we need. You can leave now. It looks like you came for nothing. Let's go, Monique. - No good-bye? - Don't go. - Ladies - - Good-bye, honey! Ladies, I'm not that sort of guy! - Bye! - See you soon! - Good night, Michel. - I'm staying with you. No. I came to get you out. Now I'm going home. - I'll accompany you. - Impossible. I'm not alone. - Who are they? - Friends. - Introduce me. - No. - Why not? - I don't know their names. Doesn't matter. You know mine. Let's go. Good evening, gentlemen. Get in, Monique. I'm delighted to meet you. 78, square de la Muette. We brought her back. - Irma, bring us some champagne. - Yes, madam. Now, Michel, go away. I'm following the rules. I received a balloon. - Please, Michel, go home! - Never. I was invited like the others. Why should I give up my spot? In that case, suit yourself. Gentlemen, champagne? - I'd love some! - After our long trip... - Stand back. You didn't go. - Neither did you. Can you believe this guy? - Madam, may I speak? - Go ahead. You'll talk later. I'm married. I have seven children. Two still in the cradle. I live in Bécon-les-Bruyères. I yearn to experience the finest adventure of my life. I've sacrificed everything for this affair. Although you wrote "I'll be alone after midnight," I notice you're not alone. - No, she's not. - How appalling! - Be quiet, Michel. - Michel is right. Hold on, gentlemen. Of course I sent more than one balloon. Some were bound to get lost. Good Lord. What will we do? We'll settle it with a draw. Present! Reporting for duty. - You can't do that, Monique. - Why not? It's awful, playing poker for madam! - No, we'll play dice. - No dice for Zanzibar. - Not funny? - No, it's very funny. - How about bridge? - Yes, you can be the dummy. - Monique. - Enough joking. Come with me. Sorry, madam, gambling is against my principles. Take this then. This way, gentlemen. - This is hilarious! - No, it's outrageous. Everyone write their names on a slip of paper. I'll be right back. - I don't have any paper. - I'll give you some. - No one has anything to write with. - Here, sir. - You call that a pocket pencil? - I don't have anything smaller. - Here's your pencil back. - Thanks. - What's he saying? - He probably can't write. Hold on, I may have just the thing. That's perfect. This is yours. God of chance, smile upon us We swear to you Our allegiance It's up to you to decide Who will win The grand prize In this moment of suspense You could hear a pin drop He's in for a fine time The one who'll share her bed God of chance, smile upon us We swear to you Our allegiance Now the purest heart shall pick. - He can't read. - Give it to me. It doesn't count. "Michel." - It doesn't count. - Why not? - Because... you're practically family. - Not yet. Michel, what you're doing is despicable. I want revenge on my husband, but not with you. - Why not with me? - Because you - Because I - Who are you? Good evening, madam. What are you doing here? You received a balloon? I'm too old to play with balloons. How did you get in? The window. - Why not the door? - I didn't dare. - I'd have let you in. - If I'd known that... - Who are you? - Who am I? Sportsman Megalomaniac Booklover With a healthy fear of the law Art lover and most of all I am, madam - What? - A gentleman A gentleman Thief - Open up, madam. - Open the door, Monique. Be quiet. Madam won't be able to sleep. - Really? - Of course. - Open up, madam. - Open the door, madam. Your friends are too noisy. With your permission, I'll leave. No. In my profession, we don't like noise. - If you're truly a gentleman - - Thief. ...you won't leave me alone with these men. Please stay, I'm begging you. - What if I get caught? - Who cares? Stay. - Monique, please. - Madam, why do you resist? She must be deaf. Deaf and heartless! I see now. She's a tease. A tease? A tease? I'll teach her to play with fire. Where's he going? Hello? There's a fire! 78, square de la Muette. - I need you. - Me? I guarantee it'll be worth your while. Really? I don't want to submit to a certain man. You must stay with me until morning. I can't refuse that. Now I'll open the door. - Don't open it, I beg you. - Are you afraid? In my profession, we fear nothing, but prefer to keep the door closed. Be quiet. - Her husband has returned. - Dear God, how terrible! I guess we'd better leave. Let's go. Stay! It'll take two men to protect her from that brute. You can count on me. My life is hers. - I'll open and you'll shoot? - With pleasure. Except it's never loaded. Too bad. Maybe next time. What are you doing here? Ask the lady. - He's my lover. - Monique. No. Not yet. Listen, sir, go home. - You have a wife. - Yes, madam. - Ten children, three in the cradle. - Yes, madam. Go home now. You can dream of your unrequited love affair. It's better that way. - I loved you so much already. - You'll get over it. Here comes trouble. I'd better go. I'm out without authorization. Hurry! Leave me alone! - Is there a fire? - Yes, in my heart. Open up for the firemen! Excuse me, sir, where's the fire? I don't know. I'm leaving. Ask my neighbor. The fire, sir. Where's the fire? What? - Tell us where the fire is! - I don't know. - Here's my mistress. - What is it? Madam, where's the fire? Fire? This is idiotic! There's no fire in my home. Pardon, madam, but is this 78, square de la Muette? - Yes. - And you deny there's a fire? - No fire. Right? - Absolutely. Hands up! - At your service, madam. - Thank you. Good-bye. Help! There must be a fire, madam. Someone is calling for help. What's going on? Hurry! - Hands up! - Calm down, kid. Help me. What's wrong with you? What is this man doing here? How did he get in? - Through the window. - He's a burglar. Unbelievable! Me, a burglar? Listen, little lady, shall I tell them? - What? - That you invited me. - I'm a buddy. - A buddy? He's crazy! He's just a burglar. He called the fire department to create a diversion. I did it to drive this fox from her den! Be quiet! Go on, take him away! Let me go! Come on, let me go! Let me go! Be quiet. While you're at it, will you take him too? If your siren is broken, he'll come in handy. - Afterward, you'll leave. - No, I received a balloon. - So did the black man. - I played and I won. I'm the winner. - It was a joke. - I demand my prize. To your health! Thanks. - Definitely not. - Why not? - You'd be angry at me tomorrow. - I love you with all my heart. That's what I mean. The man who spends the night with me, I'll never see him again. I don't want to spend one night with you, but 18,262 nights. - How much is that? - Fifty years. Boaster! - Come on, Monique. - Michel. I don't want to ruin our friendship. My husband will be back soon. He can't find us together. - Understand, Michel? - I understand, but I'm not convinced. No, no. Madam, you asked me to spend the night with you. That's right. - I didn't come with that intention. - I hope not. I need to leave for New York tomorrow. Yes, I will burgle, on May 12, at 12:12 a.m., Al Capone's safe. - Sounds like a good plan. - It's not bad. Regrettably, I must leave you at dawn. - You're staying until dawn? - It's the best I can do. It's more than I'd like. Monique, please ask him to leave. Mr. Thief, I beg you to stay. All right. In that case, I have a proposition for you. Twenty-five yards from here is a villa with a fine collection of antiques, silverware, and transferable stocks. The owner is away, the servants are on vacation, and the guard dog is paralyzed. How very interesting! I'll draw you a map. Hold on. It's perfect for you. Thanks, this is great. You won't even need to pick the lock. My friend left me the keys. 75, square de la Muette. Thank you, sir. You're very helpful. Madam, duty calls. I must bid you farewell. You're not very gallant. My humble respects, madam. And my regrets. Get out of here. Good-bye, sir, and thanks. Don't mention it. Cocktail, Monique? - It's your villa he's going to rob. - I know. - You're crazy, Michel. - I love you, Monique. - And I'm - - Extremely decisive. I'm beginning to believe it. Halt! Right face! Coats down! To the paintings! I've loved you for six years. You know that. You told me for the first time today. I've been telling you for six years. I didn't hear you. - You just had to look. - What? To look at me. To speak of love Is looking into each other's eyes To speak of love Is a kiss that speaks volumes Hands can say, "I love you" Better than any poem Communicating without words Is delightful To speak of love Is a very expressive sigh To speak of love Is a smile that says, "How divine" How can I lie When my heart is next to yours? That's worth more Than any romantic speeches To fully express The joy of loving you I dream of unknown words All sounds uttered Have already expired All the words have already been said To speak of love Is looking into each other's eyes Each other's eyes To speak of love Is a kiss that speaks volumes Speaks volumes The pink of your blush Expresses so much Nothing could be more marvelous Romantic oaths Can't hold a candle to it It's worth more Than every love poem in the world Madam! Your husband is back. - Where is he? - In his study. - Did he see you? - I think so. Thank you. Go. Michel! Monique, love calls me elsewhere. Forgive me, I'm leaving. Excuse me, gentlemen. What's going on? Where are you going? We're going to see the lady at number 78. The lady at number 78! Get out of the way. I'm going there too. Where are you going? We're going to see the lady at number 78. Excuse me, I'm looking for 78, square de la Muette. Unbelievable! I have no idea. You made the right choice, dear. - What a tramp! - Yes. Hear that? It must be the balloons. - More? - The others. - What others? - The latecomers. Some balloons flew far before they landed. Weren't any lost? - Michel? - Monique. What will we do? - I'm scared. I don't want to stay here. - Then come with me. - Where? - To my house. I like what you've done to the place. He left me a chair. "With my best wishes for your happiness." What a swell guy! - Monique. - What, Michel? Tomorrow, I don't think you'll be alone after midnight. Michel... No, Michel. THE END
