Here's a surprise. Guess who's not coming to Thanksgiving? Your dad? He's such a hypocrite. I hate hypocrites. I'm sorry. Is this for me? I figured you'd have more use for it than I will. Right. Thanks. I swear to God. The man is incapable of keeping a promise. What was his reason? You tell me. He's your friend. - Carrie... - He said he has to, um, stay in London. Why would anyone choose to stay in London? London's awful. When's the last time you were in London? When I was 12. When your mom was sick? Don't do that. Do what? Make associations in your head. I don't like London because it is cold, it is repressed. And everyone looks like they've smoked too many cigarettes. Did you make any friends this week? You and I both know there's a perfectly good reason I don't have any friends. So, what did you do this week? What I normally do. - Reading? - Mostly. And how many books did you read? Seventeen. And does reading 17 books in one week seem normal to you? No, no, of course it's not normal. I mean, does skipping three grades of school seem normal? Does going to Harvard at the age of 14 seem normal? I'm clearly not normal. I thought we'd established that was the problem. Carrie, I want you to do something for me. What? You and I are going to come up with a list of goals you're going to achieve between now and the end of the year. So, for our next session, I want you to think about some of the things you'd like to have on that list. Things you've done in your life and enjoyed. What kind of things do you expect me to put on this list? For example, join a club. Why should I force myself to go out and meet people who have lowered their moral, ethical, and intellectual standards in order to fit in with other people who have low moral, ethical, and intellectual standards? You're such a contrarian. No, I'm not. A little helpful advice. One, try to stop pontificating and rubbing your exceptionally high IQ in people's noses. Two, give humanity a chance. Someone might surprise you. Time's up. Carrie, wait. You were quite late, so I don't mind going a couple of minutes over. I do. I'm actually in the middle of reading Foucault's "Archeology of Knowledge." I highly recommend it, by the way. And, if you speak to my dad, please give him the message that I don't accept his excuses or his apologies and that hiring me a therapist is no more a satisfactory replacement for an actual parent, than sending me off to college at an inappropriately young age. Sorry for being, um... I completely understand. Happy Thanksgiving. You too. Hey, Carrie. What's up? Hi, Ronald. - Do you need a menu? - Oh, sure. Someone still buys DVDs, huh? Someone still does, yeah. And you know what? I have never had to wait for the movie to load halfway through the film. I'll have the soup. Yeah, sure. - Hi, there. - Hi. Look, before you launch into your moves or whatever, I just want you to know that I'm not really in the right frame of mind to make flirty chitchat with a total stranger. Even though, admittedly, you're quite a cute one. But I've just... dealing with being let down by my dad... not for the first time. And I've just had a really tough session with my therapist. - Um... - I'm sorry. I just wanted to know if I can borrow this chair. Oh, definitely. Yes. Take it. Knock yourself out! Not with the... chair. Hey! Do you want me to pack this to go? Yes! Please, yes. What the hell is that? Yo! World music guy! - Hey! - Can you go and hold your one-man aborigine festival thing somewhere else? Like Australia? Sure. Hi, Dad. Hello, darling, how are you? Got your message. You're not coming for Thanksgiving. Shocker. So sorry, darling. I really thought I could swing it, but I just can't get away. It's such an American thing anyways. I promise I'll be there for Christmas. Well, it would have been nice to have a bit more notice. But listen, I do have good news. I've found you a job at the law firm of a friend of mine. In what world is that good news? If anything, that is very, very bad news. But it'll be good for you. Well, I'm still four years ahead of my peers. Do you want me to be maladjusted? It'll be easy, I promise. It's a night job, proofreading legal briefs. You love reading. Not proofreading, and certainly not legal briefs. Well, at least it'll be quiet. You won't have to talk to a soul if you don't want to. If you have a better offer, by all means. What happened to "Take some time"? Well, it has been a year, darling. And to be absolutely honest, it would really help if you could bring something to the table, so to speak. Isn't there some other way? You could get a roommate instead if you prefer. Okay, fine. I'll take the job. Hello? - What you listening to? - Hmm? Wait, isn't that from Bugs Bunny? It's "Morning." "Peer Gynt," Edvard Grieg. I'm pretty sure that's from one of the "Looney Tunes." Who are you? - Douglas. - Do you work here? No, I just didn't have anyone to spend Thanksgiving with, so I've been wandering around the building hoping to find someone to share my turducken. Right. I'm kidding. You're Carrie Pilby, right? I might be. Sometimes when the documents get copied and/or faxed, the periods end up looking like commas. And the "Hs" end up looking like "Ks," You know, that sort of thing. No wonder lawyers charge 400 bucks an hour, they pay people to play "Concentration." Oh, no. I'm sorry. Douglas got to you first. I always try to get to the new people before he does, but he's quick as lighting. Ooh. I'm Tara. Carrie. I wish I could say he's more the exception to the rule, but what can I tell you? This job attracts a strange breed. Clearly. You're gonna fit in just fine. Holidays are a drag, huh? For some people, yes. What did you do for yours? Nothing. Just... just went to work. What? You got a job? Well, my dad got it for me. Kind of a consolation prize for not coming to Thanksgiving. But I didn't have to eat any dry turkey or talk to anyone. Wonderful. So, how's it going with the list? What list? The list we talked about last time. I have no recollection of this list. You've got a photographic memory. - It's selective. - Excuse. I've been very busy. Excuse. I haven't had time to... - Excuse! - Stop saying... Excuse. Well, not to worry. I made one for you. Go on, read it. "Go on a date." "Make a friend. Spend New Year's Eve with someone. Get a pet." It'll help to have something to care for. Keep going. "Do something you loved as a child." Like what? Well, it could be anything. What did you do when you were six that you don't do anymore? I wrote several strongly-worded letters to oil companies when I was six. Wow, okay. How about an indulgence that you no longer allow yourself? I used to love drinking cherry soda. Excellent, there you go. Great, I'll drink a cherry soda and all my problems will just disappear. What's next? "Read favorite book." Ah! Do you have one? Yeah, "Franny and Zooey," Salinger. But I don't have it. I lent it to someone. Can you get it back? I don't know. Well, look, just try. See how it goes, do what you can, one at a time. Why do you want me to do this so much? Because staying at home in bed all day won't make you happy. You need to get out and meet people, begin some meaningful relationships. Maybe if you put yourself out there, doing things you enjoy... Hmm, "Franny and Zooey," one of my favorites. You've got good taste. Well, welcome to English 303, the Modernists. I'm Professor Harrison, and you are a bunch of kids who think you already know everything but haven't even got a clue about what life is really like beyond the ivy walls. It's banal, nauseating carousel of responsibility and disappointments, one after another. But, my sweater is soft and the rain streaking down the window is kinda lovely, so I guess I won't off myself just yet. The Modernists, especially Joyce and Wolff were very big on stream of consciousness techniques in their novels, and you just got your first lesson in it. Would anyone like to give it a try? Say whatever pops into your mind. "Franny and Zooey," how about you? Oh, I wouldn't know what to say. It's not difficult. You just start with your name, where you're from, kinda go from there. My name's Carrie Pilby, I... well I was born in London but I moved to New York when I was 12 just after my mom died. I guess I shouldn't have said that, 'cause now everyone's feeling weird about the girl whose mom died. Like I'm Antigone or Harry Potter, or Bambi or something. But I'm not a Greek tragedy or a wizard. And if I was a character in a movie, I'd like to be Katherine Hepburn, preferably in a movie where she gives Spencer Tracy a run for his money. But I can tell I'm boring you now. And this is hard, harder than skipping fourth and eighth grade. But not as hard as skipping second grade, because going from pencil to pen was pretty abrupt. Excellent. If you want to use pencil in my class, you're more than welcome. Now, anyone else wanna give it a shot? Carrie? Carrie? I really believe that if you do the things on this list, you're going to feel a lot better about life. I bet I won't. So, prove it. Prove to me that I don't know how to do my job. - You're a very odd man. - Thank you. That's the nicest compliment I've had all day. Hi. Davy, I would like a goldfish, please. We're having a two-for-one special. I just want one. But the other one is free. They're social creatures. You heard me say I want a fish, right? Not a chimpanzee. Fish swim in schools. They like company. Fish swim in schools because, evolutionarily, it gives them a better chance of surviving. My fish is going to be living in a one bedroom apartment, not the Great Barrier Reef. Fine, just give me two fish. Great! Taxi! Katherine... your job is to prove Petrov wrong. Spencer, your job is to keep Katherine happy. Hey! Get away from there before I call the police! Why? One, because you're clearly smoking something illegal. And two, because it looks like you're about to burgle that apartment. Why would I want to burgle my own apartment? - You don't live there. - Well, then I definitely - need to stop paying rent. - No, some other guy - lives there. - Yeah, my roommate, Ted. Okay, well, if it's your apartment, why do you play your didgeridoo in the street like a crazy hippy? Because Ted doesn't like me practicing in the apartment. I can't say I blame him. You wanna play it? It might help you relax. What makes you think I'm not relaxed? When people's shoulders aren't naturally aligned with their earlobes like that. Maybe I'm cold. Maybe you shouldn't make assumptions about people you don't know. Hey listen, I was just razzing you... I didn't... mean anything by it. I am going to work. If anyone calls, take a message. Did you just have an orgasm over a cherry soda? Can you just leave me to drink my soda in peace? Oh, of course, of course, I'll let you two have some privacy. So, what's your deal? Are you a student? No, I graduated last year. From where? Boston. Boston University? No, it was in Cambridge actually. Emerson, Brandeis, Northeastern... Harvard. So, why don't you just say Harvard? Because when I say Harvard, people always reply with something asinine, like, "Say something smart." Hey, did you know Carrie went to Harvard? No way. Say something smart. No, no. Seriously. I think the influence of Kierkegaard on Camus is underestimated, I believe Hobbes is just Rousseau in a dark mirror, and I truly believe with Hegel that transcendence is absorption. Cool. I have no idea what you just said, but you sure sound like a friggin' genius. I stole that from "Infinite Jest" by David Foster Wallace. Oh, come on. Smart and pretty? You must be killing it out there. You have a boyfriend? Is that really your next question? Okay, so what kind of guy are you looking for? I'm not looking for any kind of guy. So, you go for girls? No, I'm not a lesbian. Are you a nun? Good one. I can't believe you've never had Moroccan. I've always wanted to try it. And thanks for inviting me. Well, I couldn't have you alone on Thanksgiving, now could I? What, so you don't take all your students to dinner? Only my best and brightest. Sparkling water for the lady, and a glass of Barolo for me, please. Thank you. You know... I skipped a grade of school growing up, too. Yeah, it was so frustrating knowing that I was smarter than most of the adults I knew, and yet they still treated me like a child. I hated, absolutely hated, being treated like a child. Yeah, I really hate that too. Although, I technically was a child until fairly recently. Yeah, but you've got an old soul. And I'm kind of young at heart, so I guess we meet in the middle. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Well, cheers. Cheers. Oh, oh, that's just masterful. Really, really delicious. How's your water? It's pedestrian, with a frothy finish. Would you like to taste my wine? Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay. First, breathe in the bouquet. All right, now take a sip. Let the wine coat your tongue. Really? That looks good on you. What? The wine. It stained your lips red. It's in every single sexual fantasy I have. Things are going great, and then right before the main event, the phone rings. Do you answer it? No, but it still totally ruins the moment. So, things get hot and heavy, but just before intercourse, the phone rings. And then, my penis becomes the size of a nub. It practically disappears. I'm like a Ken doll - with no genitalia... - Oh, uh... - Good God. - Sorry. I thought I was late. I'm sorry, George. It is time, in fact. Let's come back to this next week, shall we? Oh, we have a couple more minutes remaining. But we could tack that onto next week? Absolutely. Thank you, George. Okay. Thank you, doc. - Call me. - Carrie! Carrie! That was awful. And I'd appreciate you not listening in on my sessions. Sorry, the door was just flat enough for my... for my ear. Anyway, I was very eager to get here, because I have your precious list, and I'll have you know I've already ticked two things off. - Really? - Don't act so surprised. I'm a very good student, you know. All right. Well, let's hear it, then. Okay, firstly... I'll admit the cherry soda was excellent. Very good. The jury's still out on the goldfish. They don't do much. Well, when it comes to goldfish, I'd lower my expectations. Good start. Maybe if we can focus on some of these other things. Carrie. What's so great about being happy anyway? There are some brilliant unhappy people. Kierkegaard, Beethoven, Van Gough... Morrissey! Anyway, I'm not unhappy. You'd be a lot more convincing if you could look at me when you say that. One of these days, you should decide you're going to let someone get to know you. You can start by trusting me. Don't you think that real companionship would help? What about going on a date? Any more thoughts about that? Why does everyone act like sex is this magical, happiness cure-all? I didn't say anything about sex. Well, then, you're the only one, because it seems to be the only thing anyone talks about. Who's anyone? Well, people at work, people I overhear in cafes. That weird little perv who was in here just now, talking about his disappearing penis. Please, leave him out of this. Why can't I go into a grocery store without being accosted by headlines claiming 101 ways to have an orgasm. Wouldn't 50 three-ways be sufficient? Wouldn't... wouldn't one? Well, it's true that sex is a big part of adult life. If it weren't, the human population would die out. But it doesn't mean that everyone is sex obsessed. It may seem like that to you now, but I would gather that if you were older and had more experience, it wouldn't seem as glaring. What makes you think that I'm not sexually experienced? Are you? I can have opinions regardless of whether I myself have had sex. True, but it's hard to comment on what it's like to fly in an airplane if you've never been off the ground. However, if you have had sexual experiences, and you want to discuss them... No thanks. Ew. Anyway, you can't just go on a date. You have to be asked. Not necessarily. I refuse to troll the Internet for a date. I don't know, You just might end up having the most fun you've ever had. Or I 'll end up locked in a crate and shipped overseas to be a Saudi prince's sex slave. My guess is it'll probably end up being somewhere in between the two. "Single male seeks adventurous woman into hiking..." Blah, blah. "Single male, 76." No. "Single white male, engaged and confused. Due to be married, but want to test the waters first." That has to be the most inappropriate ad ever posted. All right. I do not need to be judged by you right now, Katherine. Petrov said, "Go on a date." He didn't say it couldn't be to rat out a cheat. I could find out the name of his fiancée and warn her. Huh? Kill two birds with one stone. Cross off the list, and catch a hypocrite in the act. Shh. It's ringing. Hello, this is Matt. Please leave a message. Hi, Matt. You sound really, really cute. I sympathize fully with your situation. I'm dating this great guy, but there's just no chemistry and I wanna see if I'm right. When I saw your ad, I thought, well, this could be discreet way to find out. Like you said. My name is... Gloria Patch. Gloria Patch. What? Are last names even allowed? Maybe that wasn't so discreet. So yeah, just Gloria. Call me and we'll go on a date. Bye! Okay, that went well. Thanks for the support. What do you mean I didn't leave my number? Damn it! Hello? Is... is that Gloria? Who? Oh, yes. Yes, it is. This is Matt, you just called me? So I did. But I didn't leave my number. Oh, it came up on my phone. Oh, cool. You sound really great. - Thanks. - So... would you like to meet somewhere or something? Sure. How about 12:30 at Añejo on 28th? It's very nice, very atmospheric and very public. Well, I don't want too public. No, no. Of course. Well, it's not so public that you would be outed, but public enough that you wouldn't be able to kill me without witnesses. Okay. Okay, well, that sounds good. Okay, great, bye. What does one wear to expose a cheater? Not that. Jesus! You scared the crap out of me. How long have you been standing there? No time at all. I was just about to knock. Look, I just wanted to apologize about what I said the other day about you not being relaxed. You're right, I don't know you and I shouldn't have judged. I'm Cy. Okay, well, apology accepted, I guess. Carrie. I thought maybe I could invite you to dinner or something. - What for? - I don't know, I thought it might be fun. - Fun? - Yeah, fun. You've heard of the concept? I'm familiar with it, yeah. One of the things that people do and they indulge in it to divert themselves from the true realities of existence. Well, look... If you ever feel like leaving your apartment... - Just... - What the hell is that supposed to mean? Nothing, just... You have a reputation around here for being a bit of a hermit. Is that right? Well, if you don't mind, I'm actually just going now to meet someone. A male someone. See how I'm leaving the apartment? I see, yeah. You might want to spread the word. Oh, I'll definitely do that. Good. And Carrie... got some lipstick on your teeth. I hate it when that happens. Hey, party of one? No, actually, two. I'm meeting someone. Really? Like, a man? Yeah, a man. Okay, cool. Just look around and see if he's here. Well, I haven't actually met him before. I see. But I know his name. It's Matt. Matt. Yeah, I think I know who he is. - Uh, um... - Gloria... Sorry. That's okay. There. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Wow. You're just, uh... You're much more beautiful than I had expected. Am I? Yeah, I thought I would only get desperate ogresses applying to an ad in the "Village Rag," let alone a woman who's into literature. How did you know I'm into literature? Gloria Patch... from Fitzgerald's underrated masterpiece, "The Beautiful and the Damned"? Okay. I'm a massive geek, sorry. Oh, don't be sorry. You won't beat me for geekdom. I'll take that challenge. - You're on. - Okay. Should we order some drinks? I'll just stick to water. Not to be a spoilsport. No, actually, I don't drink either. I never saw the point of it. Oh, well, in my case, it would be illegal. Really? How... how old are you? - Nineteen. - Wow. So, you... you're a student? Ex. I graduated Harvard last year. No way, I went to M.I.T. - Did you? - Mathematics. Hang on, so you must have been 18 when you graduated? That math degree came in handy, huh? Well, that was a little thing called subtraction. Have you guys decided? I'll just... a quesadilla with water. And I'll have a diet Coke and a cheese enchilada. Great. I'll take your menus. Coming up. A diet Coke? Yeah, I'm just trying to keep the weight off before the... Yeah, so, I'm surprised that someone from Harvard reads the personals. How else should I find a man? Wait for our eyes to meet while trying to solve Fermat's theorem? Well, Fermat's was already solved in 1994. Well, one nil to you. - Asshat. - Shit for brains. Dwayne, Joshua... I just used to get called dork. We actually had a kid whose last name was Dork. But it didn't really hurt him, though. He was way too good-looking. Well, luckily, he didn't have a first name like Dick. It was Dick, his first name. Dick Dork was a person's name that you knew? - Dick Dork. - Well, I'm gonna have to come to your apartment and look at your yearbooks to make sure you're not lying to me. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Was it just me or did you find everyone in high school stultifying? Yes, in fact if you used that word, "stultifying," in front of them, they would have shouted SAT word! - SAT word! - Yes. - I remember that. - Yeah? And the teachers were lousy too. Well, actually, two of them are coming to my wedding. What are you doing? Oh, nothing, I was just playing - with my napkin... - No, no, no. What are you doing here? I mean, what's with the ad? Oh, uh... My fiancée and I got together when we were really young, and I love her. I do, but I... I just sometimes think something's missing, and I don't wanna do the wrong thing, so I'm just looking for clarity. Does that make any sense or do I just sound like a total dick? The two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. When's the big day? February 4th. Oh, excuse me! Hey! I'm choking! Oh, I thought you didn't drink. And I thought you'd be a creep. Would that have helped? Frankly, yes. I came here with the intention of exposing you. What do you mean? I read your ad, and as a member of the female gender and people with integrity everywhere, it pissed me off. So, I thought I'd make a date with you, find out about your girlfriend, and then tell her she's about to marry a cheat. - Oh, my God. - What do you expect? You're getting married in two months, you're trying to meet girls in classified ads. - That... - I thought I'd find a narcissistic rat bag, not some handsome, charming, smart... you need to be honest with her. I know, I know. You're right and I... I just want to be clear about how I'm feeling before I do that. Are you clearer now? No. Well, I'm glad to have helped. Good luck with the nuptials... I guess. Or not. Oh, yeah. You liked him, didn't you? Whether I did or not is irrelevant. He's engaged. And that is that. You should definitely see him again. What is it about the word engaged - that you don't get? - He's not even married yet. What's the problem? Even if he were married, who cares? I care! I try very hard not to be engaged in activities that are harmful to myself or others. Okay, you don't think it's gonna hurt you to not get to hang out with someone you like? You don't think it hurts to deny yourself the possibility of love? Okay, next time you see Matt, ask him his fiancée's middle name. There won't be a next time. Why? Because guys don't usually pay attention to details like that. But if they're in love, they do. They've been together forever, of course he's gonna know her middle name. So, it's a good test then, isn't it? And if he doesn't know it, I'd say he's fair game. Yo, yo, yo. What's up? What are you guys... what are you talking about? Oh, you know, clothes, makeup, boys. Hmm. Sorry I missed that. So, are you going to see the legend tomorrow night? Who? My recently ex-boyfriend is playing a gig at Natto's. Why is he your ex? Because he chose to go off with some whore, that's why. And she is so not his type. Yeah, he much prefers sluts to whores. What's his name? His name is Dex and he's a jerk. But he's amazing. Like, his tongue should be registered as a national treasure. Hey, you should come. You... you should totally go. Sure, why not? Hey, that's my philosophy too. Thank you so much for going. I cannot watch another Dex show. ♪ Never really felt bad about it ♪ ♪ As we drank deep from the lie ♪ ♪ 'Cause I felt melting magnets... ♪ Uh, hi. Vodka, straight up. Actually, what's the one all the sorority girls drink, the one that makes you really drunk? - Oh, rum. - Rum, double. I.D.? Can I... can I give you my I.Q. instead? 185? Surely I can be better trusted with alcohol than older, less intelligent people. Are you 21? Alcohol is an organic compound in which the hydroxyl group is bound to a carbon atom so that the chemical makeup of the ethanol in your slightly toxic wares is C2H 5OH. I think I can handle it. - Hey, just lie. - I'm not a liar. Well, he's not going to give you a drink unless you do. Well, you know what? Morality is inconvenient. Coke, please. Regular, not that diet shit. Okay, you're feisty tonight. I like it. But at least let me, like... Wait, can... Why can't people just like me for who I am? Nobody likes anybody for who they are. That's why we have to pretend to be better than who we are and then let people find out the truth later, you know, once they've already invested. That makes you sound like a psychopath. Okay, well... Mm. It's spiked. Wow, looks like she is a genius. Finally, the recognition I've been craving. Maybe... maybe that was a move. I don't get why people are so sex obsessed. It's like a national epidemic. Because sex is freaking fantastic. It's not that great. The kissing part maybe, but the main event is nothing to be obsessed about. Yes, I win! I knew you weren't a virgin. What do you mean "you win"? - Win what? - Just a bet with Dougie. About my virginity? It's not about your virginity, okay? I made some money. Be happy for me. Your problem is you haven't had sex with the right person. There's a lot of good, clean sex going on out there. And by clean, I mean dirty, okay? And just because people like to do it, doesn't mean that they're obsessed. Do you think people are sleep obsessed because they like to sleep every day? You have to sleep for survival. Some people screw for survival! Sleep obsession doesn't hurt anyone! Neither does sex, if it's between two consenting adults. The Victorians forced people to deny their natural desires... Shouldn't our natural desires sometimes be denied? Like, what if your natural desire is to step on a baby? Okay, yeah, you... you have a point. - Like, stepping on babies... - Bad! Should be avoided at all costs. I just think that people make an awful lot of excuses to indulge in bad behavior on the pretext that "I wanted to do it," or "if we're discreet, it won't hurt anyone." Humans are hypocrites. And that's what makes us so bloody interesting. What language was that? That's how you speak. That's how you come off. You should know that about yourself. Oh, my God. What is this? Is this a bucket list? You aren't dying, are you? Because I do not have the emotional maturity to deal with a terminal friend right now. It's not a bucket list. Then what is it? I see a therapist. He made it for me to help me be happier. Oh, honey, you don't need a list for that. I'll help you. Okay, I'm having a New Year's Eve Party, for one thing. You should definitely come. Also, you should call up that bad boy from the paper and give him the bang of his life. He'll leave that twit he's with, and you'll never be lonely again. Do you seriously think that? It's not your job to be everyone's moral guardian. If you like the guy, that's between you and him. He's the one with the fiancée. That's for him to deal with. Not you. Ooh, there he is. Okay, okay. Do they say, like, "Get off the stage and do me?" Yes, but not in a good way. How can it not be in a good way? Dex, I love you, you asshole! I have to go. I know! He's so good, right? ♪ I put my foot down ♪ And I stomp on the pavement ♪ ♪ I'm a wire through a plaster wall. ♪ What are you thinking about?

No, you did, you did. Then who are you? Oh, dear, I probably should not have picked up the phone. This wasn't how I wanted us to meet. But I did want to let you know how excited I am that you'll be joining us here for Christmas. The kids are practically wild with anticipation... The kids? - What? - Oh, Daniel, please tell me you have told her about us. Told me what? Oh, God. Hello, darling. - What's the matter? - Told me what? What haven't you told me that this woman and her children know that I don't... apart from that you're not coming to New York for Christmas! Well, it was meant to be a surprise, darling. I've got the ticket so that you could come here. To London? But that's a shit surprise. You know I hate London. And anyway, you promised we'd always have Christmas here in New York. You know, darling, life doesn't always work out as we... as we plan it. We have to adapt. But why? And when were you gonna tell me? And when are you ever gonna stop lying? I thought it was too long a conversation to have on the phone, and so I decided - I'll wait till you... - And then what? When exactly was the perfect time to tell me that you're abandoning our Christmas tradition because of some woman you're shagging, and her kids are obviously more important. Now, Carrie, that is not the way it is. Matter of fact, Fliss and I are going to be married. I'm sorry, it sounded like you just said you were getting married. I did. I am. We are. So, when you come over, we can have a long luncheon, talk everything through, and I'll explain all to you. You get to meet Fliss. I don't want to meet Fliss. Darling... we can sort this out... Go sort yourself! Hi. I can't believe you called. Neither can I. - Allow me. - Oh. - I'm glad you did. - Mm. Thank you. ♪ Bring me back ♪ Bring me back to you... ♪ This is a nice place. Ah, thanks. Can I get you something to... Where is she? She's at a meeting in Westchester with some guy at Craft. She opened her own advertising firm and he is a friend of her dad's, so she thinks he might throw her a bone. Is that a euphemism? What? Oh, God, no! What if he did throw her a bone?

You can't see, but I had my eyes closed for second. - Um... - What? - What's the matter? - Is that her? Yes, it is. She's watching us. No, no she isn't. It's just a photo.

All the photos and stuff are a real mood killer. You know what else is a mood killer? Having a fiancée. Get... my... How are you going to say vows, sacred vows in front of everyone you know, that you will honor and love and cherish this woman, forsaking all others, when you clearly don't respect her, which is the foundation of all of those things? You're not going to leave her, are you? I... I really like you. I really think we could be good together. You deserve to be stimulated by someone who's on equal footing with you, and so do I. Then end this facade of an engagement. I will! I mean, you know, I might. I just met you! Not for me! For you, for her! Look, I thought that you wanted this. Just because you want something, doesn't make it right. Oh, Jesus, Pollyanna. This is real life. Real life is complicated. Don't be such a child. I think this has been my best semester ever, Carrie. Me too. Oh, I forgot, I have something for you. Oh, yeah? Mmm-hmm. It's um... it's more of a loan than a gift. I thought you might like to read the first edition version. But, I need it back because it's really special to me. How sweet, thank you. I promise I'll take good care of it. You make me happy, you know that? You make me happy too. Um... You know what would really, really make me happy? What's that? If you could say this one thing for me... What thing? I can't say that. Why not? Come on, you're such a quick learner. And it's just one little thing. You only have to say it once. You can... I mean, you can start slow. It won't sound right. It won't sound like me. Sure it will. Just say it. What do you want? I... I can't. It's too embarrassing. Are you serious? Why can't you just do what I ask? Because I don't want to. And frankly, I find it a bit demeaning. It's not demeaning, it's fun. Not for me, it isn't. You know what? I tried. But if you can't just do this one thing for me, then... Then what? Jesus, David, why are you acting like such psycho about this? Don't be such a child, Carrie. I'll call you a cab. Shit! No! No, no, no, no. Katherine! Ugh! I'm sorry! I don't understand. I need you to take him back. We can't accept returns. He's all alone. I can't do that to him. And you're the one that told me that fish were social. I already killed his friend, I don't wanna kill him too. You killed who? Katherine. It was an accident. Did you eat her? What? No. What? Lots of people eat goldfish on dares. That is insane. Please, take him back. But don't let anyone eat him. I told you. No refunds or returns. I don't want my money back. Just have a heart, it's Christmas Eve. Oh... Store policy. Hey, hey, what are you doing? Be free! Make friends! Have a life. You can't do that. Take him back. I don't know which one is which. I'm calling my manager. Merry Christmas, Spencer. Is everything okay? What? I heard screaming. Oh, no! That was the television. Oh, okay. Has your roommate put you outside again? Yeah, but if you don't want me to, - I could... - Oh, no, that's fine. You go ahead. I'll be here... obviously. Hey, hey, hey. Do you want to go for a walk? I mean, it is Christmas Eve. Normal people don't like to spend it alone. How would you know what normal people do? That's just what I'm told. Don't you have to practice blowing indeterminate sounds out of a large piece of wood? I could do with a break. So, do you live alone? - I do. - Lucky girl. My roommate Ted is insane. - Really? - He barely says a word. And when he does speak, it's invariably to lie. It's actually incredible. I've never met anyone like him. How long have you lived there? A few months. I was roughing it, living in a basement down in South Jersey for a while, just waiting till I got a job so I could move to the city. I didn't want to come here and be owing money to friends, or having to live with four annoying roommates. - You know? - Now you just have one annoying roommate? That's a victory from where I'm standing. And you actually have a job playing the didgeridoo? There can't be too many of them - going around. - Well, I don't just play the didgeridoo. Oh, what else do you play? Just some other instruments. Like what? You really want to know? Otherwise I wouldn't be asking. Okay, let's see... Flute, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, tuba, saxophone, guitar, piano, drums, bassoon, harmonica, and the triangle. I'm actually pretty killer on the triangle. And the didgeridoo. I'm still learning that one, but yeah. Did you study music in college? Yeah, at Berklee. Do you like music? I'd be a weird person if I didn't like music. I used to listen to old records at my grandmother's when I was a kid. I was actually quite odd when I was younger, you know. Impossible. Who's your favorite musician? John Coltrane at the moment. Nice. You heard of him? He's kind of famous. You'd be surprised by how many people have never said that. Knowledge is kind of my thing. Oh, yeah? So, were you one of those head-down academic types in high school? You could say that, yeah. And I'll bet you were in every after school society. Not every one. Just Harvard Model Congress, Excellent Exegists, Mathletes, College Bowl. Wow. You really were a nerd. Well, that's something coming from a band geek. Touché. What's your actual job? I play, um... I play clarinet for the New York Philharmonic. But I mean, I just started, so it's... it's nothing. That's incredible. Your parents must be so proud of you. You know, you'd have thought they would be, but the truth is they really don't get it at all. My... my dad wanted me to do something more practical, I guess. Ever since I tried to explain to him that music's my thing, he pretty much refuses to engage in any discussion about it. That's awful. How do you deal with that? I don't know. I didn't for a long time. And then one day I just thought, "Screw this," you know? I have one life and I'm allowed to be happy. You know? He'll come around if he comes around. Yeah. My dad has a whole new family. I just hate the feeling that I've disappointed him. Has he disappointed you? Mmm-hmm. But that doesn't mean you don't love him, does it? No, no, no, of course not. So, maybe it's the same for him? I mean, I'm sure he loves you. What's not to love? So, uh... what about you? - What do you do? - Oh, proofreader. Professional, though. Not one of those amateurs you hear about. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm not like you. I don't have it figured out yet. Well, when you do, I've got a feeling you're gonna set the world alight. What makes you say that? That's just what my gut says. Do you wanna dance? No, no. I dance like a rhythmless four-year-old. No, no. Seriously. You'll have images you won't ever be able to get out of your head, like when you see - a really bad horror movie. - I love horror movies. Seriously, no. I won't take no for an answer. Here, come on. - Oh... - Come on. Okay, okay. You asked for it. All right. Here. Put your arm here. - Are you ready? - Mmm-hmm. You're freezing. No, it's okay. Here. Take my coat. Thanks. Looks good. Is this yours? Yeah, Salinger. You read it? What am I saying? Of course you have. Um... I... I have to go. Go where? There's just something I have to do really quickly. Would you mind if I borrowed this? I'll bring it back tomorrow. You're really close by. Of course. - No problem. - Thank you. It's been really nice. You're not nearly as bad as I thought you were. Merry Christmas! Hello? Is David there? Who is this? Carrie. Who? Can I just please speak to David? Carrie? I want my book back. What book? The one I lent you. My first edition of "Franny and Zooey." Yeah, I'm right in the middle of hosting a Christmas party. Can we discuss this next month when I get back to my office? Could you please just do this one thing for me? Well, I'll tell you what. If I find it, I'll be sure to let you know, okay? Merry Christmas, Carrie. Okay... God... I'm not going to lie. I don't really believe you exist. So, I don't really know what I'm doing, or who I'm talking to, but anyway, I just thought I might at least let you know in the unlikely event that you did exist, what my requests would be this Christmas. It won't take long, I promise. So, firstly, I'd like things to be better for the homeless, the old, the sick, and anyone who's not doing so great. I'm sorry for when I judge people. And I'm sorry for the not-so-good things I've done lately. It just seems kind of hard to avoid doing them. But I'll try and do better, I promise. Oh, and this might sound really petty, but could you please help everyone learn how to pronounce "In Excelsis Deo" correctly? Thanks. And... I know... that my mom probably isn't up there with you, but if she was, I just want her to know that I really, really, really miss her. And I know that my dad does too. As for him, I'm just tired of fighting. I just really wish everything could be like it was before. So, anyway, that's it I guess. Amen. Oh, and happy birthday. I know it's Christmas, so you don't have to work, even though you're Jewish, and technically you don't celebrate, but we need to talk. Are you okay? Not really, no. And I'm sorry to interrupt your non-holiday, but I couldn't wait another week to tell you that your list is crap. - All right, just hold on... - No. I will not hold on. I need you to listen to me. Because of you, I am a fish murderer. Even worse, I almost slept with an engaged guy. And I am more confused than ever. Like, is it so wrong for me to do what is right and be happy? Because if so, I am destined to be a miserable person, list or no list. Carrie, stop. Please, come inside... I know what you're going to say. You're gonna say I can't say the list is crap because I haven't finished it yet. But the thing is, I can't finish it because I left my "Franny and Zooey" at Professor Harrison's. - Okay, so get it back. - I told you, I can't! I don't need to finish the list to know that, shocker... drinking a cherry soda will not make my dad pay attention to me. Having a goldfish won't bring my mom back. It did help me learn, though, that going on a date could make me feel more lonely than ever. You know what I think? I think you're the one who needs a list. And it should have things on it like, "Don't have affairs with married women." - Now wait a minute. - And fine, you're an adult, so you can do what you like, but so can I. And just because I don't want to do demeaning or immoral things doesn't make me a prude. I mean, a prude wouldn't sleep with her English professor, would she? You slept with your English professor? Dad! I tried to tell you. What are you doing here? What... what is he doing here? I was worried about you. Obviously, I had a very good reason to. - Why didn't you call? - I did call. You didn't pick up your phone. Because my phones are broken! Where's your new family? Did you ship them off too, so you didn't have to deal with them? That's not fair, Carrie. What he did to me isn't fair. That didn't stop him. Go home, Dad. I came so that you wouldn't have to go to London, which you seem to hate. No, I don't hate London, I hate you! And I hate this stupid list! Well... that went well. Give her some time. Hi. Wasn't sure if you'd remember. It's been such long time. I'm a prodigy, aren't I? I think I can remember the simple phrase, "If you get lost, I'll meet you at Hans Christian Andersen." Poor guy. Never found love. Wrote all those books for children and never had any of his own. Mm. Might be a good thing. If he had them, he undoubtedly would have disappointed them. I really want you to like Felicity. I should have told you. But I thought that if you met her first, then she and and her kids, you'd give them a bit more of a chance. When your mother got sick, I felt that I had failed her somehow. My whole reason for being was to take care of her, and you. And then I got really terrified that I was going to fail you as well. So, I thought that you would be better off with people who understood how to teach you. I mean, you were so far ahead of your classmates. You were brilliant. And I thought if you went to college, you'd meet people who were of like mind. I was 14. I was a freak. What about the English teacher? Made me feel like less of one. At the beginning at least. Did he... hurt you? No, no, it wasn't like that. You can press charges. Dad, I don't think you can press charges for hurting someone's feelings. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fact that you were underage. I was 16. That's the legal age of consent. And anyway, he never forced me. He manipulated you. He used his position. I'm gonna have him fired. Well, he's teaching at Columbia now, so it looks like someone beat you to it. I just wish the bastard would give me my book back. - What book? - "Franny and Zooey." Don't you remember? Mom gave me a first edition for my 12th birthday. Oh, yes. So she did. You lent him that book? I thought he'd appreciate it. I thought he'd appreciate me. Right, that's it. Come on, let's go. Where? We're gonna get your book back. - What? - Where's he live? Dad, I really don't think... Carrie, where does he live? Hi. Hi. Is David here? Who is it, Amanda? There's a girl here to see you. Carrie. What an unexpected pleasure. This is Amanda, my wife. Carrie Pilby, a student. Ex-student. You got married? Yeah. Congratulations. I'm Daniel Pilby, Carrie's father. Well, it's nice to meet you. We've come to get a book that your husband's been kind enough to look after for me. Oh, yeah, the book. Well, it's somewhere inside the house. As soon as I have a chance, I'll find it, and I'll put it in the mail. Why don't we save you the trouble and have a quick look ourselves? Excuse me. I already told you, I don't know where it is. But you said yourself it must be here somewhere. Hello. Do you mind? No, not at all. We won't be a moment. Happy Christmas. Same to you.

I wasn't sure if you'd show up for your appointment today. Did your dad leave? Yeah, he did. I miss him already. You can go back to sleep if you want. No, no. I was just a little tired. Long night? You do realize it's not appropriate for me to discuss my personal life with you. I think it would really help me if you did. All right. What do you want to know? Was there ever a time when you thought that cheating was wrong? Of course. I still do. Then how do you justify it? Don't you feel bad? Yes. No. All of the above. I do part-time consulting for Cheryl's agency. She works with abused children. We spent a lot of time together. I invited her for coffee. We talked, we talked more. We wanted to spend more time together. I suppose I am what you might call a hypocrite. It must bring you great joy to hear me say that. No, no. It doesn't. Her husband doesn't show her any affection. - That's an excuse. - He's always gone. - Excuse. - He's been cheating. - Excuse. - And maybe... Excuse! Maybe she'll leave him? Excuse. I just came to let you know that my dad and I made up. I'm very glad. And, okay. He helped me to get this back. "Franny and Zooey." And as we often say in my profession, how did that make you feel? Like maybe I should finish that silly, or not so silly, list that I threw in your general direction? Oh, I was hoping you'd say that. You saved it. Just in case. I have a photographic memory, remember? Thank you. So, what are you going to do about Mrs. Rubin? I don't know. Contrary to what the degrees on the wall may imply, I don't have all the answers. I wouldn't trust anyone who thought that they did. Maybe you need to make her a list. "Five ways to leave her husband." You know, sometimes... you really remind me of your mother. Thanks. I'll take that as a compliment. Compliment intended. You are allowed to be happy, Carrie. You know that, don't you? Your mom would want that for you. Shit. Carrie! Oh, thank God! I thought you might never speak to me again after I abandoned you at Dex's gig. How can I ever make it up to you? You already did. You helped me cross something off my list. I did? Which one? Make a friend. - Oh! - Oh, okay. You're hurting me a little bit. Oh, come on. I want to introduce you to Dex. - Dex? Dex-Dex? - Yeah. What, "Nationally registered tongue" Dex? - Okay. Okay. - Oh, sorry! Oh, Carrie, this is Dex. Dex, this is Carrie. Hi, nice to meet you! Yeah, you too. Oh, uh... He seems... nice. Yeah, he is. I'll call you. We'll go for lunch. Oh, oh! I would love that. Well, see you later! Okay. Pilby! - Cheers. - Cheers. Are you wearing eye makeup? It looks good. Hey, what's the square root of 6,023? Seventy-five. You're a freaking genius! - I made it up. - Like, what's the equation? What special equations do you use? You know what, I'll tell you on Monday. You're leaving? I have a party limit, and I'm all partied out. But I'll see you later. Happy New Year. What a scene here in Times Square! Hundreds of thousands of people crammed in here. Very excited, counting down to midnight. - That's a no brainer! - Absolutely. Well, I'd like to get in the hot tub already. - I'm so cold right now! - You're cold? Are you kidding, it's 40 degrees. Try living in Minnesota. - Should they get in the hot tub? They should because we're freezing and we would love to get in the hot tub. You're from Phoenix! Should they get in the hot tub? Yes, you ladies get in the hot tub quick! - Get in the hot tub! Come on, get in the hot tub. - Fuck it. Hey. Hi. You must be Ted. Is Cy in? Moved out. What? When? Yesterday. Oh, okay. Um... - Well... - Bye-bye, then. Oh, okay, um... Well, is there any way that I could... Happy New Year. Is it... What is the matter with you? Can you not stop lying for one minute? Hey, sorry. You see what I mean? The guy's a compulsive liar. You literally can't believe a word he says. Nice tux. Oh, yeah. We had a concert. I just got back. You didn't wanna go out after? New Year's Eve isn't really my thing. Me neither. Do you want to come in? If that's okay. Yeah, I think that could be okay. Actually, would you mind waiting here one second? There's just something I have to do really, really quickly. I'll be... I'll be one minute. Okay. You're always disappearing. Sorry, I thought I left the stove on. That's okay. This is a much better spot anyway. Spot? To watch the fireworks. They're about to start. Here, take my hand. It's freezing. I'd loan you my coat, but someone forgot to return it. Oh, right. Oh, I'm sorry. Shall I pop in and grab it? You just stay right here, Carrie Pilby. So, what's Cy short for? Cyrus. What about Carrie? Nothing. It's just Carrie.
