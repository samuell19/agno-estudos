[music] [John-Boy] In those days before Thanksgiving, 1947 it seemed unlikely that we would sit down together as a family for the traditional dinner. The years of growing up were passing and we were caught in the tides of our individual lives separated by much more than miles. Hi. - Why did you do that? - Because I'm your husband. And besides you're crazy about him. [both chuckling] Well, I wonder if I want another of those or for you to help me with the groceries. - How about both? - Okay. This isn't for tonight, is it? Oh, no. I got a head start on Thanksgiving. Mommy, Daddy. - Hi, honey. - Hi, sweetheart. Give mommy a kiss. - Got some beans. Yum, yum, yum. - Yum, yum, yum. Oh. Where'd he get to? - Who? - John-Curtis. Told him he can play, but not go far. You know, he has sand in his shoes. Give him half a chance, he'll run off. You blink and he's gone, Elizabeth. Supposed to keep an eye on him, right? - That's right. - 'Ha ha ha.' - I wasn't gone for two minutes. - We'll find him. - Elizabeth, what's the matter? - He's gone. No. What's the matter with you? - Something's bothering you. - Nothing. Nobody's going to be here for Thanksgiving. John-Boy isn't. Mom and daddy can't. Elizabeth, I'm sorry. Everybody is sorry, but nobody understands. If we aren't together, then it isn't Thanksgiving. John-Curtis. John-Curtis, where are you? There you are. I knew you'd be here. Could you, however, come down where I live? Nobody there believes you're my friend. Sometime. Maybe? Hey, Jim-Bob. Hey, Yancey. Where you going? Oh, just taking Isabella out on her constitutional. Say, Jim-Bob, I got a tire that is nothing, but patches. - You got a inner tube in there? - Sure. What size you need? Well, I'll make do with anything you got, but, uh uh, I ain't got any cash. Hmm, that's a problem. Of course, we'll be needing a turkey for Thanksgiving. Jim-Bob, this ain't no ordinary turkey. This here is Isabella. A friend and companion. Why I've known her ever since she was an egg. I'm sorry, Yancey, I can't help you. I do have chickens you might be able to pry me loose of. The coop's full now. I need that truck, darling. Truth be known I need the truck more than I need you. You're a cruel man, Jim-Bob. Get me that inner tube. Yancey, what are you doing? - Rope wasn't part of the deal. - Now, what am I supposed to do? Leave her in there, tonight. She won't be no trouble. Thanks for the inner tube. - How you doing? You Walton? - I am. How can I help you? Hi. My name's Sweeney. This here's Al Peterson. - Howdy? - Howdy? We got this garage over in Rockfish. And we're just closing it up. Thought you might be interested in expanding your little place. - What you selling? - Parts. Gas tanks, piston rods, radiators. - Fuel pumps, fuel lines. - Ha ha. You name it, we got it. We'd like to get rid of the whole kit completely just to one customer, you know. And we got thousands of dollars worth of merchandise here on the truck. We're gonna let it go for $500, cash money on the barrelhead. - Now, look here. - Hmm, fan belts. Fan belts? We got 200 fan belts. This case right here all by itself that's worth two to three hundred dollars. - You'd be rich, Jim-Bob. - I don't have $500 though. I barely get by as it is. That's too bad. If people found out you had spare parts market corner well, you'd have more business than you can handle. That's my other problem. My partner went to college and I don't have anybody to help me. Well, Sir. You can't say we didn't give it a try, can you? I'll tell you what you do is, well, you change your mind you're gonna give me a call at this number right here, huh? - Okay. - Uh, you fellas wait a sec. Alright. Jim-Bob, are you crazy passing up a deal like this? Well, you heard what they said. They're asking for $500 in cash. But I could be your new partner if you wanted me to. I mean, I ain't got no money, but Lord knows I can fix anything on wheels. - What about your barber shop? - Barber shop? I ain't cut nobody's hair since I cut off Casper Foley's earlobe. - What do you say? Partners? - Okay, Yancey. Yeah. You won't forget. You won't, I tell you. Okay, fellas, let's us talk some business. - Let's talk, alright. - Ha ha ha. [phone ringing] Hello. Hello, Daddy. Its me, Ben. How are you? Oh, I'm good, Ben. Is everything alright? Oh, everything's fine. How is mama? She's alright, son. She tires kinda easily. It's a long process this recovery, you know. You sound worried, daddy. No. I don't want you to be worried either, son. We're gonna beat this thing. It's just that my patience gets a little thin sometimes. Too bad you can't be here for Thanksgiving. Might be good for all of us. And I wish I could, son. Just everything is so disconnected without you around. This is tough on all of us, Ben. Well, give mama a big kiss from all of us, okay? I sure will. You give everybody a hug from me, huh? We'll be thinking about you Thanksgiving. Sitting around that big table. Oh, we'll be thinking of you too, daddy. Goodnight. You take care of yourself, Ben. Goodnight. [typing] [typing continues] Goodnight, boss. If, uh, if you're working for me, it's time to go home. You look awful, you know that. Don't let me keep you. Go home. Get it fresh in the morning. Got a deadline tomorrow, remember? 9:00 a.m. You told me you'd have my head. Only 35 or so pages to go, huh? - Nothing to it. - I'll make it. Look, Kanoy turned in a script today for next week. We'll run that in. You need some rest. And I don't want to see you here tomorrow either. Look, Van. - I can finish this. - You got a doctor? W-wha...I don't need a doctor. Well, you need something. Now, get outta here. Oh, hi, Van. Is he still in his office? Take him home, will you? I think, he's sick. - I've orders to take you home. - How am I supposed to work? Every time I look up there's somebody coming in the door. The phone rings or this typewriter breaks down. You really look sick, darling. Well, that's a very popular line tonight. Hey, take it easy. - Sure. - Mm. What are you doing here anyway? Well, I had a dinner date, but he stood me up. Oh, Jane, I'm sorry, I forgot. What's the matter with your head? It doesn't work. It hasn't for a while. Afraid I'm blocked as a writer. I'm not much good to me or anybody else. That bad, is it? - Did you take anything for it? - Nothing helps. I'll take you home. That'll help. Come on. Come on, John. "Love, your brother, John-Boy." He still writes a great letter. - But he's not coming? - No, he is too busy, Elizabeth. But maybe on Thanksgiving they'll broadcast one of his radio shows. That'd be nice, but its not the same. New York is a long way off. Sometimes, I've trouble believing it exists. Elizabeth, I know this is an awful disappointment-- You know, mom and daddy aren't coming either. Elizabeth, come on. There'll be a whole houseful of us. Sure is. Is something wrong? What could possibly be wrong in the land of a thousand Waltons. I don't understand. What is it you want? Air. I could use some air. I shouldn't drag work out at night. - Sometimes I push him too hard. - It's more than that, Ben. A lot more. Hi, Paul. How is the great outside world? Ah, it's busy and it doesn't know night from day. Is my family still here? My wife, your family, they'll always be here, Mary Ellen. Hello, everybody. Late as usual, sorry. You did come home, mama. You did. Oh, I'm glad you're still awake. What's everybody laughing about? Well, your son ran off again today for one thing. I went to see my friend. You better tell your friend to play here once in a while. He won't come. Goodnight, everybody. Yeah. I'm going to bed too. - See you all in the morning. - I'll be along soon. - Okay. - Okay. - Goodnight, Ben. - Goodnight. We all don't seem to get together lately. Isn't there something coming? I have this dread. - Just Thanksgiving. - 'We ought to make some plans.' Well, don't count on me and Paul. - 'Why not?' - I don't know. Paul's got some chip on his shoulder. Don't count on us. Well, try and work it out, will you? [piano music] Thank you. Thank you very much. That's all for right now. - How you two fellas doing? - Not quitting now, are you? - You're playing so good. - Thanks, Ike. - Gotta take a break sometime. - But nobody plays like you. Why don't you give it a shot, Ike? - Me? - Yeah. - Alright, I will. - Ha ha ha. - Thanks. - Paid cash for my root beer. Good. Because that's the house rules. No credit especially to relatives. What kind of a crack was that? - What crack? - About credit. I didn't ask for any. Drink your root beer, Jim-Bob. It's been a long night. It's been a long day. Seems like it kept starting over and over again. Go long so far and some come in, interrupt it. Stop and do that and then start all over again. 'It's kinda like running in place.' 'Until Yancey came over.' Not getting anywhere. Not pleasing anybody. Least of all yourself. I do the best I can. You ever think maybe you were just dead wrong. That you ought to go back to school. Start over. Listen better, work harder. Stretch as far as you can. And never stop trying? No, I don't and one thing I don't need is a lecture. Not from somebody who's kind of mean, I don't. Wait a minute. I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about myself. What's the matter with Jim-Bob? I don't know. Sometimes, I think, this whole family's falling apart. Perhaps it's just a friendly letter, sister. Let's just go ahead and open it. I'm certain it's Octavia's annual letter insisting that we join her for Thanksgiving. I don't want to join her for Thanksgiving. Whoever heard of putting blackstrap molasses in turkey stuffing? Well, Octavia thinks it's good for the digestive process. I hate to think of the digestive process. Especially at Thanksgiving. Sister. Thank you. Oh, open the darn letter, Mamie. Emily. I always secretly yearned to use profanity. Well, don't make a habit of it. "I look forward to seeing you on Thanksgiving. "Dinner will be served at 3 o'clock. "Bring something to stuff the bird with. "Preferably some of your father's blackstrap molasses. Oh! "If you've made other plans for the holiday "cancel them. Octavia." Sister, I do believe you're catching a cold. If we're lucky, it'll develop into pneumonia. [laughing] More coffee? - The script's awful. Isn't it? - Well, it certainly isn't you. Oh, it's me alright. I wrote every lousy word. Tortured word, I suspect. It feels heavy, John. I've gotta hand it in to Van. I owe him a script. But he'll never believe you wrote it. I don't believe you believe it either. I don't. I can or I'd quit and sell shirts and ties. Then, you'd get a discount on clothes. I love you, Jane. Even if you are my harshest critic. You know, it might not be such a bad idea quitting for a while. You write radio scripts all day and work nights on your novel. 'If you're not sick, you must be worn out.' - Or written out. - Is that a crime? Everybody needs to let up now and again. Change the scene, maybe the characters. Recharge the old batteries. But I never needed to. I couldn't help writing. All the time my head wrote when I was asleep. It was free and easy. There's nothing free and easy here. No, nothing. And you've already gone away, you know? Somewhere where I can't find you. [men laughing] Hey, come back here. What's the story now you got? I think Jim-Bob just went ahead. I-I'm not even sure I understand the game. I don't know either, but they've been at it the better part of the day. It's about time for the local veterinarian to lend a hand. The opera. Let me take over. I don't want you to get too much of that. Are you happy here, Ike? What kind of a question is that? I'm sure, I'm happy. I've just been doing a lot of wondering lately. Well, you got a pretty good life. I got Corabeth. We've a business and Aimee. Yeah. Elizabeth tells me Aimee won't be coming home for Thanksgiving. Yeah, Aimee's spending the holiday with a classmate. Yeah. She's really growing up, Jason. Won't be long before she'd be spending Christmases with her husband. That'll be a dollar and thirty, Jason. I guess your family is, uh planning for the big dinner at home, huh? I reckon they are. They're in bed by the time I'm home, gone by the time I get up. And we're going down to Williamsburg. Thanksgiving is a family holiday and with Aimee gone, well home is the last place I wanna be. You're right about that, Ike. - Say hey to Corabeth for me. - See you, Jason. [mouth organ music] For a while I didn't know who was gonna end up on the rope. They're pretty mean, you know that? That's what makes them taste so good. - Isn't this Yancey's Isabella? - A turkey is a turkey. They all look the same once you get the stuffin' in 'em. You want me to take care of her? - Sure, Jonesy. - Okay, come on. - See you at home, Jason. - Goodbye, Jonesy. Come on, come on. You didn't hear me out last night. I heard plenty. Just skip it. I want to set things straight. You misunderstood. I did come to borrow money, but I'm making other plans. You were right about no credit to relatives. That was supposed to be a joke. I'm sorry. How much do you need? I don't even wanna talk about it. I'm gonna handle it and that's it. - What's out the window? - Rest of the world. You're gonna have to talk to me about it sometime, Paul. About what? About whatever it is. The rest of the world, where ever you are. You're not with me anymore. Erin, our life is being crowded by your family. Everywhere I look, every minute of the day, there is a Walton. Paul, they live here. We all live here, that's the point. Ben and I work together every single day. This room, the only place we're ever alone. This is your grandmother's room. Well, can we afford to live anyplace else? No, not unless it's in a tent on the mountain. Well, it seems to me that you'd prefer that. Erin, I'm just tired of being surrounded. Sometimes I feel like I'm boxed in. I think we should go away for Thanksgiving. Maybe we could spend it with your father. I thought you wanted to stay here. I think, we need to be alone together. Away from this house. I think, I'd like that very much. Oh, I think you should go call him. I will. [sighs] Isn't it lovely? It is from a more gracious time. When ladies and gentleman actually were ladies and gentleman. - Achoo! - Bless you, sister. Thank you, dear. I was so hoping this cold would get worse. But it just sits there. Uh, this costume is for Colonial Williamsburg. Mr. Godsey and I are visiting the restoration for the holiday. We have taken rooms at The Inn. For the holiday, I remember now. It is time, don't you think that we harked back to a gentler, less grasping time? - Indeed. - Sister and I seldom grasp. Corabeth, I just can't stand this get up. I feel like some sort of a jackass. - 'Mr. Godsey.' - That's alright, Corabeth. We weren't born yesterday. But you are right, Mr. Godsey. You do look like a jack-- Sister! It's gone, Belle. Whatever made ideas fine words, shut off. There's a lock on my mind. I can't pry it open. I wouldn't try. But the novel is dead in it's tracks, I can't finish it. Writers hit snags, you know. This is a war. How are the radio scripts going? I missed my last deadline. Van's put another writer on the show. He thinks I'm sick. So does Jane. I expect you are. Well, creative juices have dried up. And dust doesn't flow, you know. I know, all the platitudes. I'll spare you most of them. But there comes a time to set your writing aside. Walk away from it for a bit. Then after a while if you really are a writer the ideas will start coming and your problems will be over. Or you maybe sick or tired. You may just need the change. Or the well maybe dry. As an editor I know the hard truth is you are the only one that can find that out. The only one. [piano music] Ah! Bravo, bravo, bravissimo. - If you say so, Corabeth. - Oh, I do, I do so verily. I never dreamed that I'd be treated to a private recital. Well, private, anyway. I need some advice.. ...and I need it kept in confidence. You can count on my discretion. Whatever you reveal to me, shall be kept...secret. You think, you can sell this place? Bah! Word.. That is the last thing I expected to hear. Can you? Well, I have to believe that I can sell anything. But.. ...it may take some time to find a buyer for this establishment. There is time. Dare I ask your plans? Nope. I see. Well, it really is in very good repair, you know. I've got all the accounting. What I've paid... what's been invested since. I shall want to be familiar with that, of course. Jason. I shaln't sleep until I know. Do you plan to run away and marry Tony? Corabeth, all I want you to do is find me a buyer. And keep this whole thing between you and me. Oh, it was impetuous of me and extreme. Please, forgive me. Well.. ...we shall simply tend to business. - You and I. - Corabeth, it's a deal. You know, I made a lot of money, one year, raiding chicken coops. Too bad I sold my hot-rod. Maybe, they would've taken it and freed it. We'll think of something. We've got to think of something. I've been out of work four and half years. What's bothering you two? We're thinking. Yeah, me too. About Arizona, mostly. We're mostly thinking about money. And Isabella. After Thanksgiving, every time I see a Walt I'll see a little of her too. Elizabeth, is Drew coming home for Thanksgiving? No, he's spending it with his grand parents. Just another person who isn't gonna be here. Too bad. [plane whirring] It can't be landing around here. Sure, Katter's hay field, on the other side of Rockfish. 'It's been barn-storming all over the country.' Did you know him? [Jim-Bob] 'I've gone over and watched him for a while.' 'Charge you bucks to see the sights.' He goes all over the country? He makes a few bucks and moves on. Could he find Arizona? Couldn't find me, not in that crate. What's her name? Her name was Isabella, but we're not gonna call her that. She's not a pet. You understand? Then what are we gonna call her? Food. She's ugly. We can play with her, can't we? Johnny, turkeys don't play nice. So just forget she's here, okay. 'Now, we're gonna give her some feed and water.' And try to fatten her up. Here we go, baby. 'No, no. Alright, get..' I'm not gonna eat her. Uh, she'll taste the whole lot better than she looks. Come Thanksgiving. Not only is no one coming home for Thanksgiving but half the people already here, are leaving. Maybe you ought to try to toughen up, Elizabeth. Not try to hold on to the old ways. Everybody else has already outgrown them. - Well, I haven't. - Can't stay a baby forever. I'm not a baby. I just like to have my family and friends around me at an important time, like Thanksgiving. Where do you think you're going? Far away from here, Elizabeth. I don't suppose you'll be back for Thanksgiving. I'll try, and that's the best I can promise, Elizabeth. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is. You don't need to yell. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, me too. [up beat music] - How are you, Jim-Bob? - Hey, Ike. Jim-Bob give you those, Yancey? - I picked them, Ike. - Outta whose yard? [laughing] It was going wild in the forest. Hey, Ike, you got any real great boxes of candy, cheap? Yeah. Well, if it's for Yancey, I'll make sure it's real cheap. [laughs] That was good, Ike. - Great candy and cheap? - Yeah. No, no, I'll call you later. No, I'll call you. Say, how's this one? I'll know when I see the price. - Hello, Jim-Bob. - Hi, Corabeth. Oh, what a suit and tie, and buying a box of candy. How is a buck and a half? Okay. Should my Aimee be jealous? That wouldn't hurt. Um, tell Jason to drop by. I can't. He's on a trip somewhere. - Oh, where did he go? - North, east, I don't know. See you later, Ike. Wonder where Jason went. John-Curtis! [John-Curtis] 'We've got a turkey at home. Jonesy says we're gonna eat it.' Please, come. She's awful big. John-Curtis! Mama. Oh, what am I gonna do with you? Now, you can meet my friend, see. He was just there. Did you see him? He'll be back. We'll wait right here for him. Not today, honey. We've to get on to Jonesy now. Sure wish he'd come home with me. [knocking on door] Good afternoon, Ms. Mamie. Jim-Bob! Yancey! What a pleasant surprise? Do come in. Thank you. Come right down into the living room. Sister, look who's here. - Hi, Ms. Emily - Jim-Bob, Yancey. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. We've brung, you ladies, these. Why, how perfectly lovely. How very thoughtful. Thank you. Now, to what do owe this unexpected pleasure? How could sister and I ever repay you such kindness? How'd you ladies like to go into the garage business? [dramatic music] Hi, there. Hey, you're home early. I'm glad. I thought we could spend the afternoon together but I'd to find John-Curtis. He was up on the mountain again. Well, you should've yelled. I'd have come with you. He talks to an imaginary friend up there. Yeah, I'm starting to talk to Isabella. Who is Isabella? Oh, I thought we'd have her over to dinner one of these days. I get frightened, Jonesy. I don't like him running off. You just give him a few more years and he'll start running off after girls. You don't think it's serious? No. Now, he's just going through a phase, it'll pass. Well, I hope it passes soon. Even Isabella has an imaginary friend. Me. Trusting her doctor, is one of the biggest mistake this dumb bird's ever made. [music] [knocking on door] Hello, brother. Well, don't blink me away, I need a place to sleep. I still can't believe it. I danced to the door and this big mountain boy standing there. I should have given you some warning. Well, I'm not complaining. This place suits you. I like it. - You read all these books? - More than once. I like Hemingway and Faulkner. Both. Now, F. Scott Fitzgerald, I've trouble with. Because you're a mountain boy, Fitzgerald was a city slicker. You're turning into a pretty good one yourself. Uh, tell me something. Were you sure when you left home that this was the move for you? I was positive. Why, you thinking about making a move? I'm not getting anywhere. It's the same thing, same songs, night after night. I can almost feel the time passing. Sometimes, it moves and you stand still, that's the worst. [sighs] I need more study. I want it, I wanna compose. But, there's the Dew Drop to run and pop tunes to play. It's a living, though. A good one. There's a lot to be said for that. That's the last thing I expected to hear you say. You're the one, who gave up everything. Your own newspaper to come here. Seemed like a good decision. Sometimes I wonder, how things would've been if I'd stayed home. It would be nice if we had a crystal ball, wouldn't it? I could look in there and know if I had the talent to change my life. Here. Read this. "The young man of this land are not "as they're often called, a lost race. "They are race that has never yet been discovered "and the whole secret power and knowledge "of their own discoveries locked within them. "They know it, feel it, have the whole thing in them and they cannot utter it." Thomas Wolfe. You're saying, I have to unlock it myself. Like, Bell says, you're the only one who can. [instrumental music] Lady of the house in? Daddy. Elizabeth. Hiya, honey. Is mama with you? No, but she told me to give you this. [kissing] I made gingerbread this morning. You must have known I was coming. Grandpa! Grandpa! John-Curtis, how are you, son, how are you doing? - Welcome, nice to see you. - Jonesy, thank you. Take up the bag, let's go inside, come on. - How you've been Jonesy? - Oh, good-- - Daddy. - Jim-Bob. I thought I recognized you in that taxi. Good to see you, son. Come on, let's go inside. John-Curtis, come on. Paul, it's daddy. - Hey, daddy. - Daddy, how are you? Oh, man. Ah, good to see you. Oh, my goodness. [indistinct chatter] - Give me a break. - Oh, child is crying. Come on, let's go inside. How long you'll be out here? [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] What made you change your mind, daddy? Your mama did. She felt thanksgiving was better than waiting till mid-January. Well, it certainly is better for us. Mom isn't gonna be alone on Thanksgiving, is she? No, she's got plenty of friends. She's hoping I'll bring her all the news about what's going on here. There's sure plenty of that. You wanna go on the mountain and meet my friend? Sure, John-Curtis, but not today. Today, I wanna be with all my family. - How about a hug for grandpa? - Okay. Thank you, honey. How about you? Come on? - What's your brother's name? - Charlie. Charlie! Charlie, look at you.. 'Look at that. Isn't he something, isn't he something?' [laughs] You haven't said hi to my dad yet. I'll be along. Figure he's got enough people on his hands already. Well, that's the wonderful thing about daddy. He makes time for everyone. How long's he gonna be in town? Through Thanksgiving. You wanna stay here, don't you? I haven't seen him in months. It'd mean a lot to him if we're both here. Okay. Ha-ha-ha! Thank you. I'll go tell him. Hardly been here two days and you're out, fixing the porch. It's nice to be active, honey. Place in Arizona is so small, there's nothing to do. Sometimes, I just sit around watching the sun go down. Did I tell you how glad I am to have you here? You have, half a dozen times. It's nice to hear. I'll say it again then. If you weren't here, it wouldn't be Thanksgiving. Appreciate you saying that, Elizabeth. I doubt, it's true. Well, it is for me. The house, maybe full, just it always was. But still, if you and mom aren't here, it feels empty. I know what you mean. You haven't been feeling sorry for yourself have you, Ms. Elizabeth? - Sometimes. - Sometimes, we all do. But you can't sit around and count what's missing. You gotta count your blessings. That way you can have a happy Thanksgiving even if you're alone. Will mama be happy? Well, she'll miss us. Yes, she'll be happy. She knows, she's got a lot to be grateful for. Especially for having a daughter like you. - Hey, brother. - Hey. I never thought, I'd get here. New York is one crazy town. It's a bad time to hail a cab. - You should've walked. -I did. I walked. I ran. Did I tell you about Dr. Lager? Milton Lager works with only the finest concert pianists. That's the one I went to his office. His secretary said he won't be able to see me for days. Try patience, you've got days. Ah, but I don't need them. Guess who walked in saying, "I'll take you to him myself"? Paderewski? No. Better. Professor Bourne from Kleinberg. So I met Langer and I played him one of my compositions. So, what did he say? Well, that we needed work, the composition and I. But, he heard me, John-boy, and he wants me to come back. - Wonderful, that's promising. - Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, I finished your beer. [laughs] [John-Boy] 'Waiter, two beers.' John. Jane. I'd to come meet who made you smile like that. Uh, Jane, this is my brother, Jason. - Jane, Schuler? - You've heard. Well, he writes letters once in a while. Jason's interested in concert music. He had a good interview today. Good for you. You'll be staying in New York? Yeah, maybe, past few days have been encouraging. - You gonna join us? - Oh, I can't. They may not look like clients, but they are. I miss you. I love anyone who makes him smile. If you go back to that mountain in Virginia take him with you for a while. Bye. She's in love with you. Well, I'm in love with her. Thanks a lot. Should I take you home? I'd go in a minute, if it were there. It is there, and everybody misses you. I wanna see grandpa there. Strong, full of life. Grandma feeling fine. Mom and daddy working hard. Full of love. I wanna see us.. ...tripping over each other's lives and laughing. Just laughing. What else, is back there? I think I must have left my talent back there. And so much I can't discover anymore. Joy in work. Aw at the wonder of this city. Astonishment, it just...simply being alive. I had those things once and they've ebbed away. I'm sick, brother. I think, I need to be home. And that's where we're gonna go, as soon as we can. [Jason] 'Let's get the bill and get outta here.' - Good morning, son. - Good morning, daddy. How are you feeling? Okay? Sure good to see you here. If I ask you how you're really feeling, you'll me the truth? I'm tired, honestly. That's all there's to it. I just had to get back to the faces I know kind of air I remember, the special feeling of this place. Looks like you've lost a little weight. Maybe a little, I'm fine, though, don't worry about me. Anything I can do for you? Yeah, If a girl named Jane Schuler calls I wanna talk to her. Jane Schuler, Jason mentioned something about her. Everything I hear, I like. Just talking about her, makes me feel better already. [laughs] Good afternoon, Johnny, where you're off to? To see the turkey? I think she's been expecting you. Is the dog sick? He got hit by a car, but he's healing just fine. When is mommy coming home? I don't know, she'd a lot of classes today. Studying to be doctor is hard work. You're not my daddy, are you? No, but we've talked about this before, haven't we? I keep forgetting. I'm married to your mom, so that makes me your step-dad. What's that? That means, we're real good friends. - I'm glad. - Me too, Johnny. I can't sleep either. Jonesy hasn't come home yet. I thought he might be working in the barn. No, Junior called, and said he fed his horse. Usually, it's other way around. He waits up for me. Daddy has been up and down, all night long, he needs mama. Those two were never any good apart. No couple is. I wish I'd been just like her. Just as understanding, just as loving, just as unselfish. Who'd play second base for us? I wasn't bad, was I? - You were the best. - Just better than you. And you're always so modest. What do you suppose, made me like that? I used to think I could do everything, so I tried it all. Mary Ellen meets herself, coming and going. That's what grandma would say. You weren't too bad at that, yourself. Think nothing of writing a whole newspaper, if you had to. [Mary] 'And now, serious work, like your books.' I haven't written anything serious, in nearly a year. I don't know if I ever will, again. You're tired. You need to rest. Thank you, doctor, that's certainly the first medicine I'm gonna try. [Mary laughs] - Where'd you say it was? - One of those boxes, there. [John] Yeah, well... so is everything else. You ought to label all that stuff. I'm the one who knows the inventory. Paul, always had a car that looks like this going way back to the old judge. They never drive it very far. Except, like at Thanksgiving at cousin Octavia's. I keep it running for him. Well, you must have keep a lot of cars around with all that stuff in there. More all the time. That suits me just fine. You think I'm crazy? I like it, right here on Walton's mountain. I like what I do too. - Doesn't sound crazy to me. - Tell that to Ben and Jason. Sounds like you already told them. Ben thinks, I should branch out. Maybe open two or three places. Now, that's not your style. Jason tells me, I should go back to school and learn more. Listen, if you're where you wanna be and you're doing what you wanna do, you're way ahead of the game. Yeah? Thanks, daddy. Well, I'm here to discuss that with the seller. Uh-huh. When would you have to know? Oh, that's-that's the only free time you have? Could you hold on a moment, please? Will you be here over Thanksgiving? I will, but you don't-- Yes, we'll be happy to accommodate you. 'We'll be here all through the holidays.' 'Uh-huh.' Thank you so much for calling. Goodbye. Corabeth, you don't have to stay home. I can show the Dew Drop. You and Ike go on ahead to Williamsburg. I wouldn't think of it, would not. Now, this man, Zimmerman, has a place outside Rollick. and my sources tell me that he is very successful. Well, it sounds good. But, I don't want you changing your plans on my account. I'll be there when we close the deal. - Jason. - Hey, Ike. - How's you daddy? - Oh, real good, thanks. We're keeping him home for thanksgiving. That's great. Listen, tell him I'm gonna try and drop by before leaving. I was just saying to Jason, that I feel a genuine pull to be near our own heart, this Thanksgiving. Uh, but Corabeth, we just made reservations in Williamsburg and went through the trouble to get those costumes. I've gotta be going. I'll say hey to my daddy for you. But Mr. Godsey, on Thanksgiving of all holidays one should be at home. Corabeth, I just put a deposit on a hotel room. I know but I've been thinking it over, and I've changed my mind. I really don't like spending Thanksgiving with strangers. Okay. How about sharing it with our daughter? Well, I-I do hate to say no, after I've said yes. Well, I know, how to put my foot down. Hello, Ms. Tany...would you connect me with the women's dormitory at Bodryde College? Right, thank you. Hello, I'd like to speak with Aimee Godsey please. This is her father. Thank you. They're going down to get her. She's in her room. Tread lightly, Mr. Godsey. I did tell her, she could spend the holidays with her friends. Corabeth, I know how to be sensitive to her needs. Hi, daddy. Who gave you the idea that you could spend Thanksgiving away from your family? Don't you understand, you're breaking your mother's heart and mine too? Daddy, please let me-- Well, I'm just gonna have to put my foot down. Daddy, I've already got my bus ticket. I'll be arriving at 3 o'clock on Thanksgiving day. You will? The more I thought about it, the more I decided I wanted to be with you. I love you. Daddy, I love you too. Bye. Corabeth, she's coming home. She's gonna be with us on Thanksgiving. [car approaching] Ms. Mamie, Ms. Emily, how nice to see you. Hello, John, how nice to see you. Two of our favorite children, home for the holidays. Come. Have a seat on the porch. Here's a little package for you. It's got that familiar gurgle. A small Thanksgiving remembrance. A little smile, that's what papa used to call the recipe. Have a seat, right over here. Right this way. Well, you two look fit. Well, we've had colds but unfortunately we are better. So, now we're honor-bound to go to cousin Octavia's. for Thanksgiving. Is that a dreadful thing to say? I know the poor dear enjoys having it. I don't remember cousin Octavia enjoying much of anything. [Emily] 'She always enjoyed ruling the roost.' Specially our roost. Now, sister, that's enough about our family tyrant. Jim-Bob has readied our car and the drive over there is beautiful. John-Boy, we keep expecting word about your new novel. [Emily] 'Yes.' Well, thanks for your interest, Ms. Mamie. You'll be hearing about it, one of these days. [Mamie] 'We'll be thinking of you on Thanksgiving.' Do rest and take care of yourself. Gasoline, I smell gasoline. So do I. A whole puddle of it underneath your car. Gas, all over the ground. Must be the gas tank or the fuel line? Got a new fuel line. Brand new. Jim-Bob just put it on. At least, it didn't cost us anything. - Sister. - Oh. Good ones are on the top. The stuff on the bottom is always that's sad. Maybe, we can put 'em into some other use. This will make a good razor strap. Let's face it, Yancey. We've been had. All I can think of is 'em poor Baldwin ladies. What do you think, sister? Well, you know, it's papa's money, don't you know? And us talkin' 'em into with the flowers and the candy. Empty. Well, at least, they'll end up with something. - And what's that? - 'Your garage.' Remember, you told it was theirs if you didn't pay 'em back. Yes, you gotta help me get out of this mess. This garage is all I've got. Well, maybe, you ought to call the sheriff. I don't think that'd do any good. Sweeney and Peterson are probably in Tennessee by now. Well, that leaves you, Jim-Bob. Leaves me where? Holdin' the bag. Still no answer. Guess, he's still out of town. Dad doesn't stay in one place very long anymore. Well, someone should answer. He's going to be disappointed. He's counting on us. - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. I think, you should stay here anyway. And you're going. I need...sometime alone. I love you, Erin. But I think we both could stand to be apart for a while. Funny, what I thought we needed, was to be together. No, I didn't. I knew we were coming to this. Where you going? I don't know. No place special, just.. Just away from here? I guess, there isn't any way to make this easy, Erin. There's no reason to make anything longer or harder. So, let's better go. You'll hear from me. Alright. [dramatic music] [footsteps] - Hey. - Put in a long day, son? You missed supper. Pretty busy. You get the Baldwin shoe line fixed? Yeah, just put another one along. Only this one will work. Got it from a garage in Rockfish. Mm, looks to me like you had enough fuel lying there to supply the whole East Coast. Baldwin's got the best of the bunch. You know, those two guys seemed okay. Closing out their garage, they said. Selling their stock cheap. So you bought stock and 'em too, ah? I bet, they load up that truck every morning and say, drive me to the nearest fool. He saw your money? It's not the worst of it. Did you use the Baldwin's money? The assembly let it slip. I didn't give him a bad deal, daddy. Promised 'em free car care, while I paid back the loan. I told 'em I could pay him back next month. Not a bad deal. You should've come to someone in the family. I couldn't go to you. I couldn't go to John-Boy. I tried to ask Jason, but he didn't hear me. Yancey Tucker wanted to help, but all he did was run away when things went sour. So you promised the Baldwin's the world, huh? I really feel bad about it. I'd give lot if I hadn't. If you lookin' for a partner, how about me? Well, you don't want to do that, daddy. There's enough on your mind as it is. And enough bills. Everyone needs a second chance, son. I'll tell you what? 'Why don't we pay off, Ms. Mamie and Ms. Emily and start over.' You've any idea how good that sounds to me, daddy? I think, I've an idea. [footsteps] Erin. Paul left. He...he thinks, it would be better if spend sometime apart. [slow music] [sighs] Well. - Goodnight. - Mmm. [music continues] Want to talk about it, honey? [sobbing] I want to cry. Erin, I wish there's something I could do. You can hold me. Yes. [crying] Baby. I knew it was happening. I couldn't stop it. Paul, knew it too. I just can't believe it's come to this. - Too many Waltons. - You talked to him? No, but I can see. He married his girl and he inherited her whole family. Didn't start it out that way. Things just happened gradually. Our live-in here. Paul, working with Ben. Me not understanding the kind of privacy that Paul needed. Privacy is a real personal need, honey. Some people need a lot of it. Well, I hope, Paul finds what he needs. I hope, he needs me. - He'll be here, you'll see. - I hope so. [John-Curtis] I come here all the time to see. He could be your friend too. There he is. I told you, he was tall. Big, tall and strong. He sure is. And he is always here. [car approaching] Best way in the world to get rid of your tension. How'd you know, I'd be up here? I figured you love these woods and want to be close to Erin. I want to be right next to Erin. Alone with her. You said it before you married and agreed to move in with her. I suppose you're angry with me? Yup. Seems to me, you're walking away from your problems. - Instead of dealing with 'em. - I came up here to think. Come to any solutions? Only that I love your daughter very much. Well, I'm glad to hear that. So, what are you gonna do about this problem? Keep coming up here and choppin' wood, I guess. Why won't you move up here with Erin? Plenty of privacy. I can't bring her up here. Half the windows are broken up and all I got for heating is a fire place. Not to mention the plumbing. There is none. I may have an answer for that. If you do, please, I'd like to hear it. [music] Is that it? That's it. Ms. Schuler, you don't know me, but my name is Elizabeth Walton. I know you better, than you might think. - How's your brother? - He's fine. I'm calling to invite you to spend thanksgiving with us on Walton's mountain. Oh, how very nice of you. The problem is I have this puppy named Stormy. He was lost and I kinda took him in. I was going home to Iowa, but it's so far away I decided to just stay here in New York. Do you think, you could come? I'd have to test Stormy, out on a bus to see if he travels. I just thought, I'd give it a try. And, so will I. Thank you, Elizabeth. - Buh-bye. - Buh-bye. Come on. Will you eat? Hey-hey, come on, eat. Stop lookin' at me and eat your dinner, come on. Got to get you fat, come on. Come on. When are you gonna wring her neck? When the time comes, I'll get it done. I thought you were suppose to safe life, not take them. Hunger drives a man to great extremes, Elizabeth. - She'll quit that. - She will. Oh, yeah. She will, won't she? - 'She is getting pretty fat.' - 'Yeah, she is.' We'll need to know, how much she's going to weigh. Afterwards, you roast them, so much a pound. I'll let you know, Elizabeth, but don't talk about this in front of her, alright? You never whisper in front of chickens or pigs. I never knew, you were from this world. [music] Do you approve? I sure do. Put a lot of life into this place. Paul's a good draftsman, he and Ben are good combination. Yeah, I hope, he and Erin are. They'll find out. Ready to talk, son? Talk about what? Now, John-Boy. You got the kind of face that says a lot. You don't need to talk. - Havin' a problem, aren't you? - My face doesn't say that. It did. Ms. Mamie asked you, how your novel was coming? See what I mean, your face is doing it right now. Well, I don't think, I can write anymore. Maybe, I had a passing flair for it but I don't think, I'm a writer. So, that's it. You gonna let it go with that? Well, what else can I do? I dunno, son. If Paul was here, he'd probably tell a story and you could figure it out. I got a better idea. "I walked the land and it's footsteps of all my fathers. "Back in time, to where the first one trod. "And stopped, saw a sky, felt wind "bent to the Mother Earth and called this home. "This mountain, this pine and hemlock. Oak and Poplar. "Laurel, wild and road had ended. "Rock and soil, long, rich for growing. "Home and mountain. Father, mother. "Wrote to the seeds. The sons and daughters. "To walk the old pals. "To look back in pride and honored heritage. "To hear it's laughter and it's song. "To grow, to stand indeed with themselves one day remembered. "I've walked the land in the footsteps of all my fathers. "I saw yesterday and look now to tomorrow. "John Walton Jr." Tell me, you can't write, don't ever tell me, you can't write. Son, you're not going to give way these feelings, are you? I'll try not. You better or I'll.. I'll kick your butt. [clucking] I dunno what I'm gonna do without you, Isabella. 'You mean more to me than all the tubes in the world.' They sure fattened you up for the slaughter. I want you to think kindly of old Yancey Tucker, now. I don't mind you for being mad at me, but try and think all the good times we had together. Morning, Yancey. Hi, Jonesy, I didn't know you was here. I hope, you're not thinking about kidnapping our prized thanksgiving turkey? I admit, I thought about it, but I turned from crime years ago. [John] 'Ah, she is a real beauty.' Many is the road, we walked together. Well, look at this way, Yance. She's fulfilling her destiny. - She is? - Sure. It's a sad and lonely turkey that doesn't die in the name of thanksgiving. I never thought of it that way. Oh, you rest easy. She wants it this way. - Thanks, Jonesy. - See you, tomorrow. Won't you come by and see what a work of art we turn her into. I'll do that. [music] There you go, sweetheart. Open for business? I got some coffee. You want some? That'd hit the spot. You find what you're looking for in New York? I'm not sure. How'd you know I was looking for something? Always hard to keep a secret around here. Corabeth. John-Boy too, he's worried about you, you know? Just not sure, if this is the place for me to be, daddy. It's right for Ben and Jim-Bob. There is a gap in my life and the Dew Drop doesn't fill it. You got any plans? Dreams, yeah. Plans, well, I'd like to go back to New York. - Get on with my music. - What's holding you here? The family needs me here, daddy. You can't think about that, son. Look at John-Boy. He's getting a life started for himself in New York But the money from the Dew Drop. Look, Ben is doing alright with the mill. 'Jim-Bob is got that little garage going.' You're not scared, are you? I met a man in New York. A great teacher and a brilliant musician. But he lives like a pauper. I never thought much about material things. Had my family and my work. It made me happy. You got to decide what's important to you in life, son. I don't even know where to begin. I think you do. [music] Here's the black strap molasses, Octavia wanted. Thank goodness, it's the last jar we have left. We must go out to the garden and pick some fragrant herbs. I hate to say it, but everything that Octavia smells so sour. So milder. [knocking] I'll get it, sister. Perhaps, someone who needed the recipe. Thank goodness, we didn't go running of to Octavia's and leave someone in need. Oh, Elizabeth. What a treat. Do come in for a visit. Sister, we have a thanksgiving visitor Welcome, Elizabeth, can I bring some tea or some milk and cookies or anything at all? Thank you, I came over to see if I could perhaps convince you to spend thanksgiving at Walton's mountain. Instead of going over to Octavia's. - We're packing. - But with great reluctance. Why don't we just stand up to Octavia and say no for a change. Because it's not good manners. This is 1947. 'Well, now what does that mean?' I've had good manners all my life. Perhaps, it's time for a change. Does that mean, you're not going to Octavia's? Well, it means, Elizabeth, that we will give the matter some serious thought. Indeed, yes. Ma. My god. Ma! Ah, my baby. Elizabeth, did you have something to do with this? She sure did. She insisted I drive over to Buckingham County and bring Grandma home. Well, it's about time somebody did. Oh, ma. It's good to see you. Hello. - Jonesy. - Got her all cleaned up here. Oh, my. You'll do the cooking won't you, Grandma? You're still the best. Look here. - Oh, I thought she'd be bigger. - They dress down quite a bit. Grandma you should have seen Jonesy he practically made friends with that turkey. Elizabeth has a tendency to exaggerate. Just glad it was you that killed Isabella. Yancey, would never forgive me. Well, I've done my part, now, if everybody else does theirs it ought to be a pretty good dinner. - See you. - Alright. Do you mind getting this? Never thought he'd get up the nerve. He's used to that thing, Elizabeth. He's seen him born and he's seen him die. [humming] - Good morning, Erin. - Hello, Paul. Get in the truck. - What? - Come on, get in the truck. 'Come on.' [engine starting] Actually it's not the most up-to-date centrifuge I bought it second-hand from a vet at Charlottesville but it works. Things are getting fancy around here. Yeah, it's coming along. Little by little, we're putting it all together. Business is good. Never thought I'd see this barn used like this. Have either of you seen John Curtis? - I haven't seen him. - I haven't since breakfast. Nobody has, he's been gone long. Will you help me find him? Let's go. What a way to start a Thanksgiving Day. Why are we here? Come on, I got something I want to show you. I see you've done some painting. Yeah, still a lot to do. I gotta put the plumbing in. I picked this sink up yesterday in Rockfish. And I figured that I could put a kitchen in, right over here. 'It won't be ready for a few more months.' You gonna live up here? If I could find a pretty girl, to help me live it here. Well, I don't know. But I suppose, that I might know someone who'd want the job. I love you. Oh, I love you too. - May I help? - Oh, sure. Come on over here, just sit up here. Let's see. If you pour that in here, and that in here and take all this and mix it up. - Okay. - 'You can use your hands.' - Okay. - 'Alright.' Are you looking forward to having Thanksgiving. Yeah. - 'Will you have turkey?' - Yes. - You know the turkey's name? - What? 'Don't you know what the turkey's name is?' No. - Isabella. You like that name? - Yeah. That's good. 'And what noise do turkeys make?' - Dabble-dabble-dabble. - 'Dabble-dabble-dabble?' I thought it was "gobble". It is. 'What do you wanna be when you grow up?' - Mommy. - 'A mommy.' 'How many babies you're gonna have?' - I'll have six. - 'Six of them.' 'Why?' - 'Cause I want to. - 'Cause you want to? Do you always get what you want? - Yeah. - 'Always?' - Mm. - 'I see.' [Mary] 'John Curtis.' John Curtis. - Answer me. - Hey, hey, take it easy. He was along here the last time he ran off. Well, let's spread out. Cover more ground that way. [Mary] 'John Curtis.' I feel sorry for the bus driver, having to work on Thanksgiving. Come to the store. My parents will show you to Walton's house. Thanks. [music] Hello. I'm home. - Aimee. - It's so good to be home. - Hi, daddy. - Hello, sweetie. Jane Schuler, Ike and Corabeth Godsey, my parents. - Very nice to meet you. - How do you do? Are you the Jane Schuler of New York city? Yes, and this is Stormy. I didn't want to leave him alone in my apartment. Ah, this the young lady, that John-Boy has spoken of so often. - John-Boy? - 'John-Boy Walton.' I guess, you'd be wanting me to give you a ride outta the house. That's alright. I can walk if you'll just tell me where it is. We wouldn't. We'll give you a ride. We're all going there for dinner. Well, that will be very nice. Thank you. [melodic music] [music continues] John Curtis. John Curtis. Did you fall, son? Are you hurt? He told me to take a nap. Your friend told you to sleep? I was tired. Come on, son. Let's go home. Come on. Ma? Oh, ma. Here, let me help you with that. Yeah. - Okay. - Have you ever noticed, ma? The more things change, the more they stay the same. Oh, yeah. Here, let me help you. I mean, look at these kids. Grown up. Some of them married. Some of them moved away. Still are coming to their old pa, for some advice. Yes. Thank God, they're not life and death problems. It's hard, you know. It's not easy to sleep at night when one of your own is down the hall not being able to sleep either. Yes, I know. I wouldn't have it any other way, though. If not come to their pa for advice, who can they come to? No one. Oh, ma. Remember, when I was a kid, I used to keep coming to you and pa for advice. Now, my kids are coming to me for advice. - Yes. - Life is a full circle. - Yeah. - It's a good circle, though. Yeah. Now, you've solved my problems, we can go check on the turkey. Oh, my God. [melodic music] Grandma, that looks just perfect. - But we should've cooked it. - No. These pies have never smelled so good. Mm. Grandma, you found the recipe. [chuckling] [indistinct chatter] If it wasn't Thanksgiving, you'd be in bed without supper. Don't worry about these kids, they're doing fine. There is Jim-Bob. - 'Who is that, right there' - Brampa? 'Yes, grandpa is right.' 'And let's see who's over here.' There he is. There's my friend. Everybody, come here, look. Yes, there he is. That's him. Ma. You know him too? Yes. Yes. A big.. [melodic music] Hey, everybody, looks like we've got company. I wonder who that is. - Hi, ladies. - 'Oh, happy Thanksgiving.' [indistinct chatter] - Octavia, came down with flu. - You're always welcome here. - Happy Thanksgiving to you. - Nice to see you, welcome. - Daddy, this is Jane Schuler. - Hello, nice to meet you. - Who's this? - Hi, this is Stormy. - And we're both so hungry. - Welcome, come on in. Set up another table, make everybody comfortable. - Hey, John. - Hi, Ike, it's good to see you. Jason, it's the moment for Thanksgiving. Zimmerman has accepted our price. - We have sold the Dew Drop. - Corabeth, that's wonderful! - Congratulations, son. - Thank you, daddy. You and Ike must visit me in New York as soon as I find a place. - Daddy, Erin and Paul are here. - They are? - Daddy! - Good for you two! - How are you, John? - Good going. Yancey Tucker. I thought, I recognized you, Yance. I didn't know. You know, I got my fancy duds on here. Oh, you're looking real spiffy. Uh, John, I don't look to ask me but somebody invited me over for dinner. It could've been any one of us. Come on in, my friend. There were times when I'd go on a mountain and shoot our Thanksgiving turkey. But this year, thanks to Yancey we got a special turkey, some of us have known. Since she was a egg. John, I appreciate your hospitality, but.. ...I just can't. [turkey gobbling] You mean, that ain't Isabella? Certainly not! That's the turkey that Mr. Godsey sold to Jonesy. [Yance] 'Isabella.' Isabella! [laughing] Isabella, darling. As soon as I finish my thanksgiving turkey.. ...dinner.. ...you and I are going home. You stay right there. Let's just eat, I'm starved! This is a bit funny. Would you ask blessings? Dear Lord, thank you for this food and, people gathered here at this table. I thought this was going to be a sad day. But, it's turned out to be a wonderful one. Please, bless this home our family and our friends on thanksgiving day. As we each count our own blessings. - Amen. - Amen. Well, come on, everybody, let's dig in. [John-Boy] There's in the wonder of childhood the magic of believing. The all entrusting, sensitive mind that reaches out to be touched. Our grandfather's long presence on this mountain made him live on, in the lives of the family who cherished him. Somehow, even unto a great grandson, he never knew. Blessings need not always be understood only deeply felt. That thanksgiving day in 1947 became a day of release and discovery. I'd come home again. And, home was still there. [Elizabeth] 'Daddy.' [John Walton] 'Yes, Elizabeth.' [Elizabeth] 'You remember the last time we were all together?' 'Before, grandpa died and before mama got sick.' 'Before, John-Boy left home for the first time.' [John Walton] 'Was up in the mountain, wasn't it?' 'Last time we were all together, we had a picnic.' [Jonesy] 'We sang songs, just about all night long.' [Elizabeth] 'I think, that was the happiest time I can remember.' [The Walton's singing] ♪ Let me call you Sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ Let me hear you whisper ♪ ♪ That you love me too ♪ ♪ Keep the love light glowing ♪ ♪ In your eyes, so true ♪ ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love ♪ ♪ With ♪ ♪ You ♪ [music] [music continues]
