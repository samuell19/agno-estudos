"MAN, MAN, ONE CANNOT LIVE QUITE WITHOUT PITY." — DOSTOEVSKY, CRIME AND PUNISHMENT Come on! Look. Down there. No, Calvez. In theory, I still agree. I just want to clarify a few details. You'll thank me one day. Your brother has a recommendation. - We'll take him. - Excellent. If we fail, we'll easily prove him as a foreigner. Because when he entered the country, he was registered at the border. If it all turns to hell... we execute him. This way, we are cleared and our men avoid the worst. This is perfect. And I have no objection to the plan. - Except... - Except what? That, even if successful, we will have to execute this man. If we win, our lives will no longer be at stake. Why then would we sacrifice his? Because we don't know him well enough. Because you too don't know him well enough. None of us knows him well enough. Nevertheless, we cannot forget what he did. The Fort Arcudia prisoners' escape. In that political prisoner rescue, nobody really knew which side he was on. Not even his lawyer, your own brother. This kind of man forever belongs to the side he has chosen. And then he keeps quiet. - Hello. - Hello. - Passing through? - Yes. - What was delivered? - Corn. Would you like a drink? Come on. It's on me. His name is Pancho. We'll wait here. Beautiful house. But the woman who lives there... she's the devil. Do you, as a foreigner, know of a worse danger for a man? Do you not understand Spanish? Do you not speak Spanish? You could have said so. Hey! We need to wait longer. CAFETERIA Your guest has arrived. Is this any way to speak? Apologize. Apologize to Mr. Miguel. Please forgive him and understand. Before you considered bringing in a foreigner, we chose him. If you don't trust my idea, it's not too late to switch. Calvez! I don't doubt the foreigner is a decent man of action, but it certainly isn't enough for his life to be spared afterward. I'll think about it. Luis? I see that you're in a hurry yet again. Why? Because you're already wearing the new army uniform. I think you're pushing your luck. I'm off. I don't want him to know me. Good luck. I hope... the people like you. They will. He'll be like his shadow. And one always needs a shadow. Men of war are so unpleasant. Good evening, friend. Please, do come in. Calvez. There's a man behind this door. Have him come out. Lanza. Did you have a nice trip? Yeah. He's a friend, I suppose? Can we talk business? - Who is he? - INDEPENDENCE The President of the Republic. That's not part of our deal. I have to shoot an unsuspecting man. We'll catch him off-guard. That'll be a stretch, for a traveling head of state. It depends on the purpose of the trip. See this woman? The trophy in the palm of his hand. That's Camito, a former actress. She is waiting for him in this house. On the road to pleasure, a man loses suspicion. You'll shoot him easily as soon as he exits his car. You really think he's going to come to this town? He decided on a local tour, and it ends in this town. He is convinced that, by traveling, his people will come to love him. He'll arrive in two days at the latest. - Who's paying me? - Me. So what are you waiting for? Just a moment. Let me introduce you to the one we've assigned to share the risk. What do you want me to make of this? This boy is our first president's grandson. He'll pass for having killed the tyrant. He'll be a national hero, see? Yeah. I get it. The people's hero... who doesn't like the people's smell. As usual. He's too known to be exposed. Just put him in a foster home. And take him out on the day of the burial. We don't want to cheat that much. We want him in the heart of the action. We want him to believe in what he will be. That's why I need a foreigner... who can keep his mouth shut. A local man would have stayed here. - Among us. - And you would have had to kill him. I'd hate to have to kill the one I hired. Lucky me. Is that all? Yes. That's all. Reach into the bottom of your bag, Calvez. If all goes well, he will become a national hero. And if we fail? I hadn't intended on failing. You're an even better liar than your brother. In America, we call it a package deal. I accept. I thank you on behalf of our cause. Do you and your cause not know how to count? - That's exactly $10,000. - Yes, and I agreed to 20,000. Yes, 10,000 now and 10,000 after the job. - It's 20,000 in advance. - "In advance"! Who's to say that once you-- Wait! There's your $20,000. This is the people's cause. Poverty. This is a lot of money for them. And so it is. - Your guns are here. - I've got my own. They will be used elsewhere. Do not leave under any circumstances. We will keep you posted. Good luck. I'll need it. Don't get worked up about it. Who's cooking for us here? Women run a cafe downstairs. The two women. You have nothing to worry about. Brothers and husbands died for the cause. "The cause". Dying means nothing in politics. Get that straight. And the ideal? Do you deny the ideal? There were martyrs, you know. We owe them everything. - Yeah? - Definitely. It's thanks to them the world's changed. Yeah? Did you read Voltaire's Comparative ideologies? And Lenin's State and Revolution? - Have you read it? - No. But I enjoyed The Three Musketeers. Go figure! So what? Nothing. It's not... This fires in bursts. It's said to travel 200 meters. - Give me that! You'll end up killing me! - I know guns. I had military training. - And left with a nice little uniform. - I'm not a child. My name is Miguel Cuaro. What's gotten into you? - I don't care about a name. - What did I say? You'll be called Chico. Nice and short. Repeat it! Chico. "My name is Chico and I know nothing." Repeat it. My name is Chico and I know nothing. That's nice. You're a good little hero. It appears not everyone likes me. Is he dead? Yes. That's one less soldier. Who sent him? Nobody, I think. - He was jealous of you. - There's no reason to be. - He was supposed to-- - Should have said so sooner. When it's too late, I no longer care. Search him. Here. Keep it. I've already been paid. I'm not here for money. Not yet anyway. Just wait until you and your little friends are in power. When we're in power, all smugglers will be shot... without remorse. I've already heard that tune. In the meantime, lock him in the closet. Me? Yes, you. This, too. Yes? - What do you want? - More coffee. And a tortilla. Watch this. I don't smoke. Chico, the little hero, who doesn't drink, doesn't smoke... A real little hero. I thought you might be hungry. TRIUMPHANT SPEECH BY ADOLF HITLER AT NUREMBERG What a monster. He shouldn't be allowed to live. - Do you disagree-- Pardon? - Tell her it's missing fried onions. Tell her it's missing fried onions. - My friend wants fried onions. - Of course. He's not hungry. Am I wrong? Are you sick? No. I'm going to clean your room. A real little hero... who only eats medals... and drumsticks. Isn't that right, Chico? I'm a little fat... Not at all. You're great. What's your name? Aurora. Well, then. - Hello, Aurora. - Hello. I heard you're a nobleman. No. You're the noble one. Hey! The action's over here. That's a woman. You must find her beautiful? Much more than that. I find her unforgettable. "Unforgettable"... Unforgettable or not, she's a sex worker! She's still the president's wife, or just about. Yet another reason. Your grandfather was president, wasn't he? And I'll bet you a thousand dollars he's had a bunch of girls like her. I'd be shocked. He'd be embarrassed. For all you know, such a woman is your ancestor. My grandmother and mother were Natives! Maybe she's Native, too? I don't like people looking over my shoulder. A rifle butt! What's a rifle butt during a revolution? She didn't undergo military training, but I'm sure she could've taken it better. Better than me, even. Repeat after me: Viva el Presidente! Long live the president! Shut up, you idiot. You speak nothing but English today! Here we go. Viva el Presidente! - Viva el Presidente! - Bravo, Cresus! What's next? - Long live the president! - Long live the president! Splendid! Magnificent! Enrique! Enrique! - Enrique! - Madam, the package we were waiting for just arrived. I went to the station to pick it up myself. Enrique! I think the priest will die of joy! Chico. There's a man with her. Who is he? I'm talking to you! She has a butler. A faithful dog, so to speak. - Good day. - Good day. You look nice. Are you meeting someone? Maybe I dressed up for you. - I didn't think you had tenants. - We don't. All this meat is for you and the old lady? Yes. If you'd like to come, you may. There's a policeman down there. Leave him. Hey, look straight ahead. Have you seen the new arrival? A leopard. I think she compliments her. Let's go. I'll force them to like me. My father was one of them. What are you scribbling? This is my journal. What are you writing in your journal? What I came here to do? Put it away. That's amateur, but it's not bad. Yeah. This is the God. A Native American legend. So, you parade around with your relics. My mother made it by hand. She gave it to me before she died. I've never been without it since. Destroy it. Are you crazy? - Any news from the outside? - Nothing. We're waiting. What are you doing? What did she do to you? Take out a pen and write. Do it. Write the guy's name who's leading the capital insurrection. Is this a joke? No, little hero. I was waiting for this. Write, or she dies. And you must have one or two ministers? This is pathetic! I can't. Look at her face, little hero. A real martyr. And I know those. There! No! You have too much to lose. A revolution can't happen with things to lose. What happened? The foreigner doesn't have a heart. This telegram announces the arrival of the president tomorrow. We didn't receive anything official. I am the official. Ruiz has arrived. He's waiting for you over there. I just got in from Potrerillos. The president will spend the night there, but he'll be here tomorrow. Camito requested him in town. They changed the escape plan. - He doesn't need me anymore. - Not true. I'm afraid that after the attack, the foreigner will be suspicious again. Take the kid, Miguel, with you. - To the border? - No, here. I sent Carlos to warn them. You go, too. I need the foreigner to get used to you. See those barrels? You'll say you need gas to continue the journey. Put them in the car... and escape through here. Behind it, there's another car. Take it to the volcano. I'll be waiting for you. What will happen to the two of them? I have three trusted men who will take care of the problem. Deserters who only think about the new army... when I'm general. - Miguel, the kid, what will-- - Young Miguel has nothing to worry about. Everything will be executed as planned. But the foreigner remains a prisoner until further notice. His fate will depend on you. The revolution forgets no one. They may forget us all. Very well, Pancho. It must be done. It must be done. Yes, but he'll leave afterward. I'll come back for you. For your eyes that brought me luck. Chico! Shit. What is it? What are you going to do about it? About what? Him! Him? I don't know. What do you mean? Are you going to wait until he gives us cholera? Cholera? I don't know. "I don't know!" "I don't know!" A hero knows everything, Chico. Good evening, gentlemen. How sad. What did he say? He said the house is sad. His face is what's sad. After this bastard president dies... I'm transporting you both. After the attack, I'm going with you. Where to? Where to? Calvez will say the word. Calvez will let us know. We're here to wait. A game? I only play chess. Foreigner. Bravo, foreigner. Bravo. One more? He plays well. Ask him... if he wants a rematch... for honor. And that he plays with White. He wants one last game, for honor. Start with White again. Thanks, foreigner. He's going to lose. He's saying you've lost. How, if he gets a king? That's irrelevant. King! Foreigner. You're done. See you tomorrow. - Losing is hard, isn't it? - No. Just not like that. Not to a fraud! You're all two-faced. He beats you all! He even gets lost in his own scowl! Don't insult my friends! "Friends", you think you have friends? Garbage, I say! Idiot! Know what you are?! A puppet! A clown! A fashion plate! That's what you are! God, don't make me. Are you alone? - No. He's here, too. - No, he's not. Bloodstains. I hurt myself. I know living with this partner is difficult... but you mustn't take things lightly. He takes some time to get to know. Maybe so. Lanza made an unforgivable mistake. His death doesn't mean much. It stays between us. Your mission is what matters. Good evening, friend. You shouldn't have left. I don't take orders. That was simply a cautious recommendation. Caution is also what is obliging us to change Miguel's itinerary. He'll travel with you 50 km from Tegucigalpa. From there, men will drive him to where he will await the aftermath of the insurrection. What you'll do for the sake of caution... They'll see me standing, facing their bowed president. Enrique? Enrique? Do you hear me? - Yes, ma'am. - Wake up. Today is the best day of my life. - Are you shaving because it's Sunday? - No. You don't want me to believe it's for the president. Yeah. He's still a man, isn't he? Not in my mind. When you're president one day, then we'll talk. How will you do it? Will you wait for him to take a few steps? No. - No? - No. So? When he gets out. What do you mean? Are you joking? Not at all. I bet when a man like him took the risk to get a woman like her... we can wait for him to come out. Especially since she must be worth it. You can trust me. Yeah? Well, congratulations. When she's widowed, you can get in line. If that is your ambition. Listen, Chico, lover of big words. See this? This. With this, all of them. Any of them. And I'm not the president. - Yeah? - Yeah. That's why you wanted that much money. Maybe you thought it's for my golden years? You've always been in this line of work? Really? - See that? - You're not answering me. You're running away. Running away? Running away from what? Something. - Or someone. - Watch it. What are you looking for? To provide me with a good reason? I don't have a good reason. I have mine and it's sufficient. Dead man! We found a dead man! A dead man... A dead man! A dead man! Let's go. We found him behind the railroad tracks. He must have fallen from the train. The train doesn't run on Sundays. - Who is this man? - I've never seen him before. It's not a good sign, especially with the president's visit. We'll inspect the houses. Couldn't his condition cause an epidemic? It's better to bury him immediately. Thank you. Let's get back to church. This doesn't mean he was killed. No. Not in the house. - Where? - Tonight, outside of town. - We must warn the others. - We don't have time anymore. But we can't abandon them! That's Camito's house. - We're not going to-- - Yes. I should have thought of it sooner, really. Wait here. But... Carlos! He's dead. Don't try anything. Go to the car. You're French? If you will. You dared kill Carlos? Just get a poodle like everyone else. Upstairs. And don't forget this. When stealing, foreigners shouldn't forget anything. Hear that? She thinks we're thieves. You're not thieves? Tell her what we are. We're... Go on. - We're going to kill the president. - Why? I think she wants to know why? You're mistaken. The president is a good man. He's done a lot for the country, and he will do plenty more. Yes, he'll make more prisons. Have you visited these... nice prisons? Did you hear about the dead children he sent for execution? Children. Have you seen how they shoot them?! Feel free to be upset, but not with women. He's young... so he believes it. And you? Why are you doing this? Then the horse galloped into heaven. There, he slept on a bed of roses, and God gave him corn and honey. And to distract him, he created shooting stars. Joaquín, come. It's bad. The foreigner left. No. He and Miguel are hiding in Pamito's house. He will complete his mission. You want to move. Start by carrying those bags by the wall. Bon voyage, Mr. President. Long live the president! What a pleasure. President. - Now, you-- - The president! Come, quickly! What happened to the president? Something happened to the president! Open the door! Quick! Poor man. - Open up! - What happened to the president? Careful... Why were you waiting for us in the car? That's my assignment. He followed us because he had orders to watch us. Joaquín... we killed him. He killed him with a single shot. A single shot. Can you imagine? Congratulations, foreigner. Weird. It's stuck. Next time, watch where you leave it. Thanks. Yes. I couldn't see them, but I heard them. Was there more than one foreigner? If there was, I didn't hear anyone. Captain! What's going on? - Backup is arriving on the train. - And over there? Detained soldiers. They may have met guerrillas. If they are many, let them join my men. Backup has been requested to take the president to the capital. And you, ma'am... - we will transport you somewhere safe. - No. Whatever happens, I'm staying with the president. As you wish, ma'am. Freedom. Ask if he can drive faster. Faster, Joaquín. I can get gas here... so no one sees us. Watch it, Pancho! Careful with young Miguel and Pancho. In a month, I'll-- Drop your weapons! Exit the vehicle! Hands in the air! Chico? - Yeah? - Come here. Hold this. Listen to me. Fire a round... every ten seconds. Once there and once there. On my word. Okay? Come out! Leave your weapons! You've been caught! Come out! You're done for! Drop your weapons! How long is this going to last? Until they run out of ammunition. Your efforts are useless! Leave your weapons! You've been caught! For the last time, come out! Let's try something else. - Give me that. - The torch? Here. Take it. Tell them if they don't come out, we'll set the car on fire. Perfect. That's enough! Come out! Easy there! It's me! What happened? What is all this? And where's Joaquín? I told you, you don't have friends, little hero. - Power isn't easily shared. - Luis. Carl Luis. If I'm not back tomorrow morning, go to the bridge, get on the first train. Where are you going? To look for that sorry man and his posse. A little revolution of my own. You saw, right? I don't have a choice now. It's me or them. Wait! No! I'm on your side. Where are you from? Who are you? Miguel. Miguel Juarez of San Miguel. Leave. It's all over. Where? Where?! Everywhere. Soldiers. So many soldiers. Who's in power? Who's in power?! Who?! Alvirez. General Alvirez. The worst one of all. Any news on Miguel? They got separated. There was only one backpack in the car. Miguel must be hiding or asleep somewhere. We'll find him later. And the other one... do you want him alive? I expected you to try. Now I'd be happy to bring his head to General Alvirez. That'll help him forgive our mistakes. Heaven grant it. It may be you who'll bring him. Do you know how to use it? I hunt once in a while. They don't have a car. They can't travel far. You two, drive 10 km and back. If you find them, return immediately. We'll go together. He'll have to take the train from this bridge. We'll monitor both sides. Joaquín, stay here. You, over there. Calvez... Joaquín? - I think we missed him. - Patience. Just wait. You should have waited. Come on. We'll take him from behind. While I'm shooting, run to the other side of the bridge. No. After you, sir. All right. Keep shooting. It won't do much good. I'll see you later... General. Listen to me! Listen up, foreigner! It's me, Joaquín Bosco. Your friend. Listen to me. Listen, foreigner! It's me — Joaquín Bosco, your friend! Look at me, foreigner! My cousin! I'm disarmed. I'm your friend Joaquín Bosco, Foreigner! Don't shoot! You'll shoot a defenseless man. Go on, shoot! What are you waiting for? I'm right here! Shoot, foreigner! You... you're hidden like a vulture! The revolution is dead. The poor will stay poor. Well, little hero? You brought me my bag. That's nice. He didn't come alone. Yeah. He left a car in town. Can you drive? - Yes. - You'll see. It's a gray car. You can leave now. Nothing to fear anymore. Your friends won't talk about you anymore. Safe travels. "Safe travels." I'll be fine. Camito. Did you forget about Camito? Did you consider her? - She knows everything. - No. She'll sleep with the new boss, but she'll say nothing. How do you know that? I just do. You stopped me from shooting her. Why?! Why?! Because we don't kill women. You're talking morals now?! I could help you. I know every border. You don't even speak the language. You saw! I've proven myself, haven't I?! Listen here, little hero. One day or another, I'll end up at the end of a rope. Do you want that for yourself too? I want to leave with you, because you're the only one who did anything for the people, who almost freed my people. And what now? What do you expect? Your people may drown. Since the beginning, you always expected the worst. You're kidding yourself. You want to look like someone else. If I'm following, I've disguised myself, yes? As a pastor, perhaps. With a good heart, too. Is that your epiphany? Now I know you. I know you well. You know me well? That's me? Move another foot... and I'll shoot you. It's curious-- It's nothing serious. A bullet pierced his leg. But he's very tired. We'll take care of him. I know you will. Besides, time will pass. That'll be good for him. You see... I no longer need an interpreter. Goodbye. We're going to the mountains, to my uncle's ranch. Do you want to come? We'll hide you. No, thank you. I have a train to catch. Good luck, you two. Foreigner... where are you going?
