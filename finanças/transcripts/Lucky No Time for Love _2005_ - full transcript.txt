Dear Priya, it's me And this is the bucket that I'd started filling with my tears... two months ago, while leaving my friends in Delhi It's filled now Why did Papa have to take up a job with the Indian Embassy? Every year they have him transferred, from one embassy to another This time it is Russia Know what? The mornings here are so cold that... my teeth wrestle with each other The things we used to eat on our way to school, back in India! Nandulal's "kachoris"... Karim Lala's "falooda"... In Russia, we find milkshakes, no faloodas... rosous, no kachoris... Priya, this city seems to have no houses at all And the buildings here look more like palaces But looking at the brighter side of the life... Now that I'm here... it seems like a Disney Magical Adventure city to me There's a forest on the way... and a small pond inside the forest Every morning, my sister Lucky throws bread-crumbs at the ducks in the pond Remember, in India, my sister Lucky always used to be immersed in... well, well... her thoughts, her poems and her books Here, her plight seems to have worsened... now she sings religious hymns too! My sister Lucky! Meera in Russia found it! Found what? Lucky Your name is Lucky. How come that's Lucky? Oh no, it's a four-leaf clover. They say, it brings good luck You mean, it'll help me clear my examinations? Sure. But it is effective only once If I find one like that, I'll pass the examinations this time... and give Papa a surprise. - Then take this one Really? I need it more than you do, because you pass every year Thank you, sis Okay... okay Now shall we? Why do we've to go to school every day? "Priya, there are three Indian girls in Lucky's class" "But in my class, all of them are foreigners" "I haven't made a single friend yet" "I miss my India everyday" Really, I miss India so much The Volkswagen VWPD for motion as a potent PDI PD130 engine The Ferrari Enzo is a successor to the f40... To the f50. Does 0.60... in 2.6 seconds, which makes it the fastest car in the world Sunaina, you are best. - Thank you, darling Sunaina, how do I look? - Like shit! Sunaina, we have a test tomorrow in school And what is this that the two of you are reading? You study for the school test, while I study for the "cool" test When he comes, he'll find that our thoughts match Who is coming? Girls, just guess No way Don't tell me he's coming! Is it a dream? - Should I pinch you? I'll be meeting him after three years The last time he came... he didn't even cast a glance at me Those dirty braces spoiled my smile But now... - smashing seventeen! I was also a bit plump then But... now... This time he'll turn around for sure, and also admire his new girlfriend But who is he? - Hush When everyone is asleep at night, I'll quietly dress up and go to meet him He will be waiting for me! He'll come for me... and lost in his eyes, I'll be a little nervous He'll grab my hand and say, "come closer" I'll comply. At some noise, I'll hug him, out of fright Ah, someone might see us! Then he'll bring his lips closer to mine and say... "Give me a kiss, honey". And then... And then? You tell me. What would you do? What do I say? I don't even know who you are talking about I know what this bore will tell. What say, Padma? Right. She will say, "The moon appears so near, no?" "Know what? The moon is 384404 kilometers away from the earth" "I learnt that in school" Really? I'd say something else "Good Lord" "Oh my God" "Why is my heart..." "hysteric?" "Someone will come, take me in his arms..." "and kiss my lucky lips" "I feel ticklish..." "I'm lost..." "I'm half-awake, half-asleep" "It's an entirely all-new feeling" "A thirst lingers on my lips" "It's a special sense of pain" "someone will leave..." "with a restless feeling..." "after seeing my lucky lips" "I'm soaring with the breeze..." "in my obsession" "My eyes, downcast and coy..." "my breaths reveal my story" "My heart thumps wildly..." "and my lucky lips yearn" "Good Lord" "Oh my God" "Why is my heart..." "hysteric?" "Someone will come, take me in his arms..." "and kiss my lucky lips" But who's coming? Adi. - Adi? Adi, who? Ambassador Sekhri's son Oh Lucky! He's so dashing... so charming... - so manly If he's so dashing and manly, why'd he be interested in a school girl? Please! You are just jealous. Okay?

You're lying All right, if you don't have a boyfriend, would you tell me... who gave you these "hicci"? Hiccups? - Not hiccups, "hicci" Know what a love-bite is? Strange. When I was in school we used to call love-bites "hicci" I don't know what they're called these days. Whatever, but I'm sure... your boyfriend gave you that. - I don't have a boyfriend And may God never give me one! I just asked God for a miracle, because I didn't want to fail the exam But then, my bicycle's tire went flat, and then I met that filthy man... who told me he'd fix my tire. But he tugged at my hair... Tugged at your hair? Why didn't you hit him? I did? - How? With my lunch box very good, Lucky Tell me... how did you get into my car? The door was locked. - Right. How did you unlock it? I tried using the cutter cutter? You keep a cutter with you, eh? Paper cutter And it unlocked? - No Then? - I used the compass And it gave in? - No I got it. Then you shoved the compass as well as the divider... into the lock and broke it. Right? - Right But it took all my strength Had you waited two more minutes, I'd have come and rescued you I don't have... Pardon? If you could talk a little louder... a normal man like me would hear you I don't have a boyfriend. I'm not those types Please believe me I've heard that several times before But I believe you Let's go shall we? Adi, are we going home? - We'll have to take the same way back And you know the situation. Dead phones, dead radio... Do you have grandparents? - No, they are dead Would you like to meet them? You wouldn't, right? So we'll have to stay here Thank you. - What for? I saw you thrash him Tell me... was that lunch box empty? Or full? Actually, I couldn't reach school, so... What's this?

Peter, I'm Aditya Sekhri. And she is Lucky Negi Nice to meet you.

Not water, it's only a sip of water Give it back if you don't want. - I'm drinking Looks like you'll have to spend the night with me. Know what? Girls would do anything for such an opportunity I know. The girls in my school... are willing to do anything for this opportunity The girls in your school are still talking about me? Not bad! I'm not history yet! Look, I belong to a well to do family, so the front seat is mine You take the backseat. And here's your blanket What happened, Lucky? Why are you making noises under the blanket? I've never spent a night away from home I'm scared If it's because you are spending the night with me... don't be afraid at all Because I'm not those types Trust me Adi...

The eldest queen is called Queen Tullu so, of all my cars, she's my Queen Tullu I was born in her lap, in her lap I played... she has showed me around, she's been hurt several times because of me... but she never let any harm come to me.

In fact, I've come to help you "Hey folks, try to recognize me..." "where I come from, who I am" "Who am I?" "Who am I?" P.D. I bring news about Adi and Lucky Great An explosive factory was blasted yesterday A cop stopped Adi at a checkpost near the factory When the terrorists attacked, Adi slipped away Ever since, there's no news of him or his car But... No news is always good news There's another good news Lucky is with him Amazing! Where is she? - With your son Impossible With Adi? Why? I too want to know why But I know that they are together Good she is not alone. Besides, Adi can speak Russian I'll inform Negi Only P. D can trace them, I told you In my worries for Lucky, I doubted P. D's capabilities, sir Another in your place too would've been surprised by his antics Where is he? Got a screwdriver? P. D? But in such a short time... - How did I change the mask? I'll tell you that in leisure I got to go to the telephone exchange. - What for? If Adi has a cellphone, I'll talk to him and find out where they are But all the phone lines are dead, sir Who said they can't be fixed for just five minutes? A great man once said... "small things like these happen always in great cities" Over here How did you get there? - Peter helped me Hungry? If you are a vegetarian, eat this. Else... Phone... phone My phone buzzed! Hello Aditya Sekhri here I have only five minutes so don't ask questions, just answer me The Ambassador, your father, asked me to trace you Are you okay? - Yes Are you hurt? - No Good How's Lucky? - How did you?

Actually, we can stare into each other's eyes and sit here all day... but there's a small hitch. The fishes can't get fried on their own so if you don't mind, would you get some firewood like a good girl? For fire? - That's right I've sent Peter to fetch a microwave But in the meantime, we'll have to make adjustments The lighter is in the car, hurry up Take the water-bottle.

"silence speaks today..." "my heartbeat's going awry..." "there's something my heart is saying" "Listen..." "O pretty one, listen to me..." "Memories of moments spent together stand frozen in time" "I'm reminded of the things you said to me" "On my moist eyes, even tears have frozen..." "but I still can't take my eyes off you" "How helpless I feel, what am I to do?" "My heartbeat's going awry..." "there's something my heart is saying" "Listen..." "O pretty one, listen to me..."

"my heartbeat's going awry..." "there's something my heart is saying" "Listen..." "O pretty one, listen to me..." Are we home? "O Righteousness King Rama..." "Thou art the Lord of Sita" "You are Ishwar, You are Allah..." "let sanity prevail, Lord" Is someone there? What happened? - We were coming towards the embassy... when someone attacked us This is ridiculous! Even the Indians are now being attacked! Excuse me, Ma'am. Mr. Negi wants to see you He's waiting for you in the Ambassador's office Dhara... stay right here. I'll be back soon Get out! Get going! Go on! - What are you saying? The police are searching every house for the terrorists! You know how seriously ill Lucky is. If I take her away, she'll surely die! But I'll land in trouble if they find you in my house! They're scouring every house for the terrorists! But they're looking for terrorists! And we are not terrorists, are we? I'm the Indian Ambassador's son! - How will you prove that you are... the Indian Ambassador's son? - With just a telephone call Telephone call? All telephone lines have been cut off! Doctor... - What doctor? Do you have a passport to prove your identity? They're going to drag you away and dump you in a dark cell! And the two of you will rot there until this war is over! And that might take 5 years, 10 years or even twenty! Take this... and get going All right. I'll go away But I'll really be grateful to you if you let Lucky stay here It's terribly cold out there, doctor. She won't be able to survive I had promised to take her home to safety Please... please, doctor? What do you want me to do? Beg you? Fall at your feet? Stand before you with folded hands? I'm willing to do that, too Please... it's just a matter of a few days I don't want any arguments with you I told you... just go away sticking a few Indian movie posters on your walls... does not make you an Indian! Doctor, an Indian is one who will burn his own house... to protect others. Thank you What happened to you? Are we going to a party? Now you're crying. You'll go home and say, I only made you cry Why're you crying? Huh? Am I crying? I'm here with you forgive me, my child My daughter is also as old as you are If I didn't worry for her safety... I'd never have let the two of you leave this place in this manner But what can I do? An Indian has been let down by a father today But I pray that wherever you live, you are always safe and sound Adi... I've just had a telephone conversation with the Minister of External Affairs... in India, and we have reached the conclusion... that all of you will be evacuated to India at the earliest Because... because the situation is worsening beyond control In the next 12 hours, all the families that are here in the Indian embassy... will be taken to the airport under special security convoys With great difficulty, we have arranged for an aircraft... and it's this aircraft that will take you folks to New Delhi sir, sir... how can we leave everything and go away like this? It took me 12 years to set up my business here and... you want me to leave it in 12 hours? It'll destroy my efforts of a lifetime! I'll be ruined, sir! - Mr. Agarwal... if you live, you will be able to work hard again But if you stay here, you may not even live, Mr. Agarwal But are we going to be re-established here... once the situation has normalized? Even if you do return, do you expect to find things as they were earlier? It would be better for us to forget about this nation God... ghosts haunt places like this scared me Why's everything so huge in here? No worse place to spend the night. What do you think, Lucky? Lucky... Lucky! Oh my God! Hypothermia! Once she sleeps, I've had it! Lucky... wake up! Open your eyes! Good. Let me go to sleep. - Do you know, Lucky? I know, I shouldn't go to sleep If you go to sleep now, I'll never be able to sleep in my entire life so wake up Ever since we've met, you either call me a school-girl, or keep scolding me You don't even know how to talk politely to girls What makes you think I don't? I know all that very well How? What do you say? Hello Thank you very much and... My fault, I'm sorry. - Is that all? No, there's more Bye... I say bye - Bye? Yes. Why? - Okay, bye I've got hypothermia, and I'm going to sleep Oh... shit "slowly, silently, come dwell in my heart" "slowly, make for me a world of my dreams" "Don't tease me... I give up" "Every thing you say is a pack of lies" "slowly, silently, come dwell in my heart" "slowly, make for me a world of my dreams" "stop being stubborn... forge a relationship with me" "Build with me a relation" "Let me go... let go of my arm" "feel my heart. It's thumping wildly" "Is this how every boy is?" "For my sake, please don't shake off my hand and go away" "slowly, make for me the world of my dreams" "slowly, silently, come dwell in my heart" "slowly, make for me the world of my dreams" "Our time of union is fleeting by, wasted" "What will I say? This is indeed a dilemma" "How I wish I could lose my heart to another girl" "Don't ever do that... I'll swallow poison and die" "I'll be the Prince of her Dreams" "There will be several girls like you" "Do not be so wicked, do not punish me thus..." "come, take me in your embrace" "slowly, silently, come dwell in my heart" "slowly, make for me a world of my dreams" "Never did I imagine that we would one day tread the same path" "slowly, silently, come dwell in my heart" "slowly, make for me a world of my dreams" Adi... I can't go to sleep. Something's poking me Madcap. Don't scream! They'll take offence Hand's up Or I'll shoot you. "Birju's a little boy, Uncle's a fatso..." "and the Uncle goes to Delhi" "from Delhi, he brought four bowls..." "one of which was broken" "And Uncle's legs were broken!" You sure have grown up, lad Looks like you haven't had anything to eat in two days Hi! I'm PD How about going home? Why the Russian army uniform? 15 hours from now, the last plane will take off from the airport here Orders are to airlift all Indians living here to Delhi A friend of mine is an officer in the Russian army His battalion will be leaving this place in just a little while In this uniform, we will look a part of his battalion And this is the safest way of making it to the airport And my Papa? Is he leaving me and going away? He will leave you and go away if you don't get to the airport on time And as long as Pindi Das Kapoor is around... I just can't see how you won't make it to the airport God doesn't work his miracles every now and then My child, as the wise old saying goes... "He who is protected by the Lord, no one can ever slay" Let me see! You look like a baby Sikh! So all right. From Lucky, let me turn her into Lakhan Singh A true son of Punjab now! That's something! Let's go, comrade. Shall we? Two miles away to the north is a railway station That's where we've got to take a train from It's tricky territory There's also the frozen sea ahead. But if we stick to this battalion... we won't face any danger Keep marching on quietly. I'll go and take a look ahead Hey midget... however high you wear the helmet, you're still going to be the midget! Hungry? What's this? - Meat I can't eat this. - Why not? It's a sin. - Why? I'm a veggie Eat it up. Else, we'll neither be veggies, nor alive Hey! Adi! Help! Help! Hands up. - Put your hands up Whatever they ask, just say "Da" "Da" means yes Adi, what did he say? He wants us to prepare ground plans of the army-base for him But we know nothing of that. - Give it to me What sketches are you making? - This is what I'm going to give him Maybe this will save us No... no! Snatch that gun! Get behind me, Lucky! Are you okay? - Adi! Hurry up I'll go and check on PD! Make it quick, Adi! PD's not in the truck, Lucky! He's not at the wheels! What happened to him? See that place? Jump! "A strange feeling torments my heart" "Maybe this is love" "In yearning, my heart finds peace" "Maybe this is love itself" "I said nothing, I heard nothing..." "and yet..." "I'm restless at heart" "my feet falter..." "we're in trouble..." "how are we to steady ourselves, my love?" "Much against our wishes, we've gotten close to each other" "Yes, this perhaps is love" Lucky! Lucky! Stop there, Lucky! Stop there! "Keep an eye, stand vigil on the heart..." "but it still won't heed anyone" "We tread on thorns, we burn in flames..." "we're in love, we shall unite" "Love blossoms even in a storm..." "this, perhaps, is love" "A strange feeling torments my heart" "Maybe this is love itself" Lucky... over here! This door is open! It's open! Get in! Quick! She said there was room only for one "Your memories, your eyes..." "I can't get over for even a moment" "so dearly do I love you..." "how will I ever tell you?" "The one I love. Smiles before me..." "maybe this is love after all" No, sir. I'm not going anywhere without my daughter Negi, my son is with your daughter. He's gone missing, too Do you think I'm not worried at all? But for how long are we going to deny the fact that... it's difficult for them to survive on those streets out there? Sir, for me, my daughter will be alive till such time... as I find her body You may go, if you wish to. But I'm staying here Negi, you can't stay here. You were sent here by the Indian government... which has now decided that all Indians must go back To carry out the orders is our responsibility and duty! In that case, I tender my resignation right now, sir Think about your wife and Dhara Don't you have any responsibilities towards them? If you stay on, you're going to die Do you want your wife to be widowed? And your little girl Dhara... loses the support of her father and her sister, in just a moment? I give you my word. Even after we have left... the search for Lucky will continue But, sir, if I don't have my daughter back... I... God, I don't want to pass my exams Wherever Lucky is, see that she has all her luck with her Adi... Adi! Adi! Why've you come back? Why did you come back? Why have you come back? Don't ever say again that you won't take my hand for a lifetime What have you done? I love you... love you I know... I always knew Hey PD! I knew you'd find us! But where did you find Queen Tullu? Oh, I love you! - My boy... enjoy the fruit, don't worry about how it has come By the way... - What? Come on Mummy! Papa! Lucky has arrived! Let's go Destiny is that I am to be with you till this place As the wise old saying goes... "seeing loved ones off isn't easy. So don't ever say good-bye" "Torn away from me, you will be. But you will always live in my heart" Which wise old man said that? - I did You take my princess on the plane... I'll send your princess on a ship Promise? - Promise Thanks, PD Let's go shall we go home? - Sure But not mine. Yours
