* THE FASTEST GUN ALIVE * I'm looking for Fallon! Is that what I heard? Are you the man, who is looking for Fallon? That's right! I'm Fallon. So, you're the one I'm looking for! Have we met before? Not... So, what is our disagreement? No disagreement! They say you are, faster than me. Yes, just that? Only that. And you want to find out, if it's true. That's right. Sir, I don't want to fight... but don't tease! Mr. Fallon... I'm provoking you, because I have to know. You only found me here because it rained tonight. Let's get this over with, Mr. Fallon, because I have to know! You don't leave much choice for a man, do you? Not when you say it is, faster than me! My name is Harold. Vinnie Harold. The money is for his headstone. Write that he was killed, by the fastest man there is. This is not true! What? There is a man faster than you! And who is he? You will find it. Who is he? You will find it when you least expect it. And in a place where you would never expect. You can't see! How can you say that there is someone faster? How can you say that there is someone faster? Because there is always someone. It doesn't matter, how fast you are, there is always someone faster. How did that happen? Fallon served first. That's right, Sheriff! Very well... take your horse and go! We don't want people like you here. We need to buy some groceries. Not here! We have money, we will pay very well. You have three minutes to leave the city. Don't waste them. No matter how fast, there is always someone faster. The purse, or life! Could it be a mint stick? Good... Come on... It's ok! Does your mom know you're in this part of town? Come on, get up here. I take you back. Come on, son. Dad said, that when I grow up... will give me a real gun. How long will it take me to grow up, Mr. Temple? Still some time. Why don't you use a gun, like the others? I see no use in a gun. So you don't have a gun? I think it's best to stop, with these silly questions. What I meant is that a gun can cause problems. You need a good move, Eric. I know what I need. Hey, George, how about you and me taking on Harvey and Walker? Not today. What's up with George, Lou? Be quiet, I need to concentrate! He never refused a game, it was always, the first to want to play. Quiet! He's kind of lost, as far as I'm concerned... Now, Lou, don't say I'm wrong... I'm not picking on George... but there is something that I cannot understand. Like what? I don't know what it is, I just... I cannot understand what it is. Yeah, I also think there's something weird, Lou. Good morning, George! Good morning, Ben. I see you are, with our little friend. His mother searches for him all over town. Can I say I was helping with deliveries, Mr. Temple? Don't you think you're missing, a little bit of the truth, Bobby? You can say that you kept me company for part of the time. That would be true. Thank you, Mr. Temple! What is it? What are you doing here? Oh, you don't have to treat me like a china doll, George... The doctor said that a little exercise would do me good. He told you to walk, a little, and not carry... Hey, do you think nobody's ever had a baby before? It happens every day. I know I know. I didn't hear you leave this morning. Well, it's just that I... I didn't want to wake you up. I was... just delivering Tucker Eddy's purchases only that. I will prepare lunch for you. No, not now. But he has nothing in his stomach, he needs to eat. I'm not hungry. That's it. I'm not hungry. So, let's start, with the inventory. Not today. That's what you said yesterday. Yes, I know... I... And the day before yesterday... and last week too... What's the difference if we don't do it today? George... What is it? Tucker Eddy came to pick up, shopping an hour ago. The store is starting to make you nervous, isn't it, George? No, it's not starting. I notice that every chance you get, you leave. No, it's nothing. Didn't sleep well, the last night. What is George? There is nothing. You are feeling the same thing. No, no. You've been like this for weeks. I'm worried. Oh, come on, stop it! There is nothing to worry about! Let's go. I know... okay... I know. What is it. New earrings? Ahn! Ahn! They're very pretty. Very pretty. I don't want to see you bored with anything anymore. It's ok? You know what. I'm going to take that inventory tomorrow. Promise. And you want to know one more thing? I would like that lunch now. It is. Future parents also need to eat. You look very beautiful tonight, Teresa. Thank you, Eric. Come on, Eric! Dance for us! Yeah, Eric! You have to dance! Come on! Come on, Eric! I play for you! But I'm not in the mood to dance! Come on, Eric. Dance! Please Eric, you can dance any type of dance! But what can I dance? And show us some steps! Come on Eric. Come on, Eric... I will accompany you. Come on, boy! Show us how it's done! Hey, Eric! Hey, Ray! Pule! Come here, George. Have a drink. You know that George doesn't drink anything stronger than cider. Isn't that right, George? That's right, Harvey. My father always said: "Watch out for the man, who doesn't drink!" I was talking about my son, who is coming home tomorrow... And you know what? I will make him the best clerk you have ever seen! Now, anyone can be a clerk! And not just anyone, who can raise cattle! You have to be a real man to raise cattle! That's right! It's like Doc and Ben here... You work, with your own hands! You build something! And you're proud of it! It is a feeling that only a man can have. A woman will never be able to feel it... Their love is totally directed, for her husband and children,... but, for man, the story is different. He can love each piece of land as his own skin... And he is capable of loving the work he does and being very proud of it... There is nothing wrong with being a trader. Nobody said there was, George. But that was what he meant. Excuse me, Brian. I just wanted to take some fresh air. Is something bothering you, George? No, nothing. Would you like to talk about it? Perhaps he would feel better if he talked. I told you, there's nothing to talk about, Dora. I already know what's going to happen. I've been noticing for weeks. You're imagining things... Okay, George. I imagined things in Dodge City, Deadwood, Cheyenne? Was? It's all over. You too, said that before. No, I know all the signs... You don't eat well... can't sleep at night... walk with your head in the clouds... and don't want to talk about it. George, this is a terrible thing! Dora, I don't want to... I just... Will you leave me alone, please? Excuse me, dear, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! We've been having a good life here, in this city, George. For four years we have lived well. Don't screw it up now. Now that the baby is coming, let's think about our son. I promise everything will be fine... I promise you! You know, that I want to believe you! But this time, George, if you're not sure... if you're not really sure... we... we won't stand a chance. Clint Fallon was killed, in a duel... happened in Silver Rapids! Who killed him? Vinnie Harold! McGovern has the button on his shirt, that Fallon used when he was killed. How was the fight? Who drew first? I tell you, it was a scene to behold. You have never seen anything like it! There they were... face to face... and then it happened! Faster than meets the eye... You should have seen Vinnie Harold. Calm and undisturbed. As if nothing happened. There is Dad. Hi, Fred. Fred, good to see you! Dad, you look great! Here's the button on Fallon's shirt. He was shot right in the throat. Mr. Spink was there and saw everything. I was a witness. Murdered there. I saw. It was like, McGovern said. Were you close, Mr McGovern? There are about 20, 30 meters, maybe less. That's what I'm saying. You should have seen Vinnie Harold. I want you to say you were killed, by the trigger, faster than there is. Hi, George. Clint Fallon was killed, in a duel. McGovern watched it all. And how is this Vinnie Harold? Cold as ice. You get chills just looking at it. Without the rain, Fallon said, he wouldn't have found me. No, Harold replied. We will solve soon. I hope the goods are whole. The road was flooded. We had to use the chains. It must have been a spectacle. You can't even imagine. Fallon was killed by a quick guy, McGovern saw. How many shots did Harold fire? Three. No, no, I'm wrong. Two, the last one was from Fallon. I say one thing. You'll never see a guy as fast as Vinnie Harold. Never. How far were they, Mr. McGovern? About 30, 40 meters, maybe closer. Aren't you afraid? Fear? I didn't have time to be afraid. It happened so fast. Faster than the blink of an eye. Then some people approached the body. How long does it take to get to Sarabande? About 3 hours or so. Here is George. I'll help you with the heavy boxes. Excuse me. I think I know you. Haven't we met before? I think not. My name is Spink. I'm a fiscal. I walk around a lot. In all cities. Kansas City, Abilene, Saint Gloria... You're wrong. And in Cheyenne. It wasn't Cheyenne! Your face is familiar to me. I've never been to any of those places. And I never saw him either. Don't be offended, Lord. I think I made a mistake. That's what I say. I do not believe. I've never seen anyone go so fast. He was about 30 meters in the open air, unprotected. Something else? You must have been terrified. Oh! You should have seen that guy, Spink. As in a show, the circus. Teeth clicking, knees bent. I asked if it was just. It's just, yes. Thanks. Vinnie Harold was terrifying. Eyes of an animal. Fast as a snake. McGovern saw Fallon, being killed in a shootout. He saw everything. Yes. Ask how it started and what Harold said. It's a dollar and twelve. I was about 20, 30 meters... Yes. Prices are growing. Yeah. With Vinnie Harold, in front of the bar... You won't want me to tell the story again! From the start. Do not. McGovern, an hour ago, who's been chattering. This is not a meeting place. This is... this... If you have business to do, great. If not, I would like you to leave. Okay, I was just telling the story. Well, then tell it, somewhere else. I've heard this story half a dozen times. It's ok. It's ok. If that's how you want it. Yes. This is how I want it. Come on guys, come on. The drink is on me. Let me see the color, McGovern... I shouldn't have done that. Look, I... They sit there talking. They always do that. You never complained before. I saw that same look in your eyes, George. I saw it outside on the stage. The same I saw in Cheyenne, and elsewhere, before the confusion. I... I didn't have a look. Just me... I can't stand to hear it like everyone else. Okay, George, okay. My mom said the easiest way to be disappointed is to wait anxiously. We carry trauma for life. So when I opened the box I almost cried. Really. That's the box that arrived yesterday, with your dress, isn't it? Exactly, what I thought when I saw it. I thought, the dress finally arrived, which I had been waiting for so many months. That's why when I opened it, the box almost cried. Was there no dress in there? Yes, you will find one there. We will see. Can't see! Doesn't it jump out of your eyes? No, no. It doesn't jump out of my eyes. Ah! So you must be colorblind, Mr. Temple. Completely. Because the dress is brown. I... I know, the dress is brown. So, there you have it, I ordered blue. I am not color blind. You asked me for brown. Ah! Of course not. I ordered blue. I remember it perfectly. Ah! Wait a minute please. I have noted your order. I'll show you right now. No, it is not necessary. Wait a moment. Of course, I remember what I asked for. It was blue, the color I always dreamed of. Here, see? That's the color I want. Hmm! Hmm! I am seeing. What do you think I do with this dress that came from New York. I can't return it. Can't you return it? Of course I can't. That's not fair. Yes, I see. Well... Ah. maybe someone else will buy it. My sister, who knows! I say maybe, because she talked about the dress. But as there is a difference in size, you will have to lower the price. Okay, okay, okay. What are you looking for, Linda? What do you want? Still do not know. So take your hand off the candy, okay? I don't like being touched there. Beautiful! I asked when it is, that you will receive the blue? I heard, Mrs... I... Linda don't touch the candy. You don't have to yell at the child. I am not yelling at the child. Just because you were wrong with the color of my dress, there is no reason to yell at the child. She fiddles with the sweets. I didn't yell at the child and the mistake was not mine. I said I remember... Look! I am... I am want my dress. I hope you take the blue dress, the green dress... Mr. Temple, I'm sure my sister buys... Look! Take the dress. Pick up any dress from the store. You can take the sweets too. Anything. Why... George! George, where are you going? He's going, to the bar! He hasn't touched alcohol in 4 years. That's why we came here. Maybe Brian can tell you, that I changed my mind, and that I will keep the dress. I can't stand drinking. Even though my husband owns the bar. I hate to think that I was responsible. There is no responsible... The color of the dress even, I don't care much. I'm going to tell him that. No, don't bother. This has nothing to do with the color of the dress. Nothing at all! They say it's faster than me. Harold told him. Then Fallon answered him. You can not imagine... A whiskey Whiskey? That's right. I want a whiskey. Is there anything wrong with me ordering a whiskey? Don't be offended, George. It's just that we've never seen you drink before. I know. I know that. Leave the liter here. You better take it slow. Why? Drinking too much alcohol without custom will make you dizzy. It will make me completely dizzy! You know, that's exactly what I would like now. My mind is so full of women's dresses and... sweets, beads, books... A man doesn't like it, to look when he's drinking. Where was I? He was facing each other. You're right. And there was one facing the other. You don't leave much choice for a man. Fallon said. Not when you say you're faster than me. Harold said. That was more or less what they said. The fastest trigger, I ever saw was Wyatt Earp. There would be no more man alive if he faced Billy The Kid. In my opinion nobody is, as fast as Harold. You know how fast Fallon was and it didn't stand a chance. Where was Fallon shot? Right in the throat. It is very difficult to shoot a man and hit him in the throat. That's exactly what happened. And you have the collar button to prove it, don't you? That's right. It is true. It's here for everyone to see. So, enjoy and tell them, what Fallon said afterwards, than Harold replied, hum, hum. What happened to you today, George? Some people don't like this type of conversation. It looks like they get bored. You know, Harvey, I already imagined, it was anything like that you were going to say. Look. Harvey gives very little value to a man who doesn't use a gun. Is not it? Eh! If you don't want to be armed, that's his problem. But if he isn't armed, you don't think much of him. Look, what's up, George? I never heard... I never heard Harvey say that. And he needn't say. Harvey, I want to ask you something. Have you already drawn that gun against someone? Harvey, did you... did you hear what I said? He said you never drew that gun against anyone. Because I never needed to. That's right. He only had to withdraw to kill, a rabbit or a coyote. You are mistaken, George. Oh! No, I'm not. There is nothing wrong with me. Does any of you here know, how to actually use a gun? See how you use that weapon, Harvey. Above the waist. You don't use a gun like that. You wear it down here... tightly tied to your leg. When you lower your hand, it is within reach. See? So, when you have to cash out fast. It comes out of the holster easily. If you put that gun on without tying it to your leg, will never get you out of that holster. Now you Carl. With all your flowers and all the nonsense there. It really is very good. It's full of tricks, with that weapon. You impress. It just doesn't mean that you know how to shoot. McGovern, you... I'm going to tell you something, McGovern. You don't shoot yourself in a man's throat. You shoot in the chest, or in the belly. You look for the widest part of a man's body. I don't... help! You think you?re very good at horseshoes. At least that's what you think, isn't it, Harvey? How many hours do you practice a day? Can you tell me how many hours? Maybe one, one, Harvey. And how many hours do you think you have to practice to be good at the trigger? I tell you, Harvey. Six hours a day. Every day, for years. You seem to know a lot about guns, George. I know! You all think, McGovern, that what they see is as real as it looks. Very well! I'll tell you something, guys, that will really haunt you! Really, very amazed! Do you know who I am? Do you have any idea who I am? I am the fastest man in the world. Faster than Wyatt Earp... faster than Billy the Kid... faster than Fallon and faster, than the man who killed him. You don't believe me. You don't believe me, Harvey. Very well. Lend me your gun. You are drunk. Carl? How about you, Lou? Can I borrow yours? No, George. Ah! That was the best joke I've heard in years! The fastest trigger in the world! Him! George Temple! What is going on with him? I do not know. George Temple is the most peaceful and kind person I have ever met. My guess is that his wife will put him to bed. Tomorrow morning you won't remember anything that happened. I hope you're right. It's always the same thing... we have to be careful, whoever walks with us. Nobody had patience with him, only me. Now everything fits! I always wondered, how could I live without a gun. Now all makes sense! He told me he had thrown it away. You even swore! He said he had thrown it, in the deepest part of the lake. You even described it, how it sank! George, don't do this. Do not do that again. They think I can only sell dresses and sweets... What does it matter, what do they think? They have to know who I am, Dora! See, Harvey? I also have my own weapon. See? You can all see it. Put it in the holster, George. We don't want confusion. Listen, George... Stay... stay where you are, Dell. Are you looking for trouble, George? Brian, give me two silver dollars. Okay, George. Brian, I want you to count to three. When I reach three, I want two men throw those dollars in the air. Bill, do you want to play one? There is no one in the world that can hit two coins while they are at the top. How about you, Lou? Okay, George. I have one more here for someone to play. Who's going to play this one? I can play. Okay, Eric. Stay right there. Lou, stay there. Very well, Brian. Start counting. Are you sure you don't want to wait until tomorrow? You'll be feeling better. I've never felt so good. Start counting! Okay, George. On... Two... three! Oh, I've never seen this...! Here's one! He got it right! Here's the other one! He got it right in the middle! Right in the middle! Harvey,... now do you believe me? I think not yet... Very well, I want you to stand, right there. Right there, Harvey. George... I want you to hold that beer glass right in front of you, Harvey. Listen, George... I'm not kidding... It's too high, Harvey. A little bit lower... A little lower... That's great. You can release it whenever you want. Gentlemen, let's celebrate inside! Hurry, back, from the counter, Lars! I pay. Let's drink, to your health, George! I've never seen anyone, use a gun like that! Just look at George. And I thought Vinnie Harold was fast! If he were to face George... he would be dead before he even touched the gun! Gentlemen! I've been to many cities and I've seen all the greatest snipers! Earp, Masterson... I saw them all... but I?ve never seen anyone this fast, as I saw here today... Never. George Temple! The fastest trigger in the world! to yours from George...! That gun! Look! It's checked! Yeah, it is. Six times! Six times... That means he already killed six men... There's nothing wrong with him, Dora... just drank a little too much. I know, Lou. He gave quite a show, Mrs. Temple. Said it was, the fastest trigger in the world. And then he showed it to everyone! You must be very proud of him! Look at those silver dollars, Mrs. Temple! I've seen it before! Dora! Here it is. You better take this with you. Now... what do you think made them move to Cross Creek? All right, all of you! Everyone stay against the wall! Why do you want to be a hero? Let's get out of there... Come on, we have work to do. Young man, my arms are getting very tired. Very well, ladies can lower their arms. Hurry up with that, Wells. I'm almost finishing. Hey! I'm done. Is that you? Oh! Not yet. How long will it take? Hmmm... not much. Don't take coins. Once, in Kansas City, he took three bags of coins. You there, wait. I'll take that! Stay against the wall! Let's go fast! Tom! Ready! I'm sorry for making you worried! Let's go! Vinnie Harold! I thought it was really you. Now you're sure... Why did it? I want to be remembered. I like to be remembered. We need to get out of here. Excuse me, if I worried you. What's up? He's dead, Bill. There was no reason for that! It was Harold, Bill! Vinnie Harold! There is no doubt! Assemble a patrol, John! Tell them to get ready for a long trip! Sheriff! Yes, Mr. Roebel? I don't like the way you are conducting things. I really do not like. What would you do? I would continue, much faster. It would be risky. That's right! They may be playing a game! But I don't want to play! I just want to get them! Today, tomorrow or next week. Does not matter. I'll get them. I'll get them, Mr. Roebel. In my way. In their own way, they will have the rest of their lives to get rid of the money. Who will want to catch them, then? I want to, Mr. Roebel. They killed my brother. Mountain! Yes, he proved to them that he is the fastest man on the trigger. The story started again, George. It is not whiskey, what people think or the demonstration. It never was, never. Dora, would you like to stop, please. Let me... You will hear me. I will say now, what I had never said before. It's all because your father's death is on your conscience. and the way he died. Stop. After the words are separated, the fact remains. One thing you were never able to admit. And you carry it brooding over you inside, until one day, like those days, like now, explodes and punishes both of us. Look, look! It seems!... it seems! Think, this is what is happening. Every time like now... who thinks of his father's revenge, who left him to die and ran away. Until you redeem yourself, you will never stop punishing yourself. Dora, I don't want anything else, okay? You have to stop. We are leaving Cross Creek tomorrow. Do not. Oh! Yes, we are going. No, George. This took us, across this country. I will not run away anymore. I will not leave Cross Creek. I will think about my son and me. Oh! no, no. Dora, don't do this. Let's go. We're in a hurry. Ah! I hate water. I hate it. It is dawning. Where are we now? I know this region very well. According to my calculations, I think Yellow Fork is here. Porterville there and us here. The patrol will take at least an hour to find out where we passed inside the stream. So there must be more or less two... two hours behind us somewhere around here. We will need to change the horses. Yes. There is a small town to the south, around here like this. It's not a big deal. But it caught my attention, for one thing. It's too small to have a sheriff. I think we can get horses there. Yes. It looks excellent. What do you think, Vinnie? How long will it take us to get there? Some time this morning. This city without a Sheriff, what's your name? Cross Creek. I've never heard of it. Let's move on. Today is Sunday. We still have time to go to church. Don't forget the thick socks. Hmm! Yes. I already put it here. Are you sure you put your sweater on? Have. Remember the night, the ball when we... I was wearing this tie... Dora, please come with me. Please, please, Dora. Will you get rid of the gun? As soon as we settle somewhere, get rid of it. I know. Cheyenne was where he promised me last time. Cheyenne, the day we left for here. Come on, I don't want to be fooled again. This time, in this city, I promised myself that wouldn't happen again. That we would have a little peace and stay here. I don't want to be fooled again. George! Say it! I love you. And I will always love with all my heart. If you ever find out, that got rid of that horrible thing inside, I'll be waiting for you. But as long as you're not sure, very sure, I don't want to know about you. Dora... Dora, don't let this happen to us... No... don't leave... Are you going to destroy that weapon today? Now? Yes... Is that... See? This weapon... It is more important, than me, our son... or anything else! No, no. There it is, the terrible thing about it. You will never be free until you get rid of it. Goodbye, George... I will pray for you. I will pray for us... May the Lord's blessing preserve us from evil... and accompany us, for life. Amen. Anem...! I'm leaving, the gun with Mr. Reverend. I don't care what you do with it. I'm sorry Reverend. I'm leaving Cross Creek. Going away? That's right. Is it because of what you did yesterday? Yes but why? Why? A lot of people here know why... and heard what happened, elsewhere. You've seen it happen before... And before they knew it,... snipers everywhere would now come to Cross Creek, just to find out... how fast I am. How do you know that? Because trouble comes with snipers. Did you know that there is a type of scum that would deviate... a hundred kilometers of your way, just to fight? This is a nice city. It's a good city... You would not want them here. These men, who you say would come... how would they know that? The story of a quick trigger runs fast. The faster the person, the faster the story spreads. Nobody outside the city knows what happened... and everyone is here in the church. Suppose they don't tell anyone else. How many of you wrote letters yesterday? Please raise your hands. All of you? How many counted in the letter, what did you see me do yesterday? That's why it won't work. Let them come! Quick as you are, they won't stand a chance! Lars, I haven't used a gun in years... and I will never use one again. But yesterday... What happened yesterday was a mistake! It was a mistake that will never happen again. Never... Now you can come with me. Yes, George. Good... whoever wants to buy my store, talk to Lou Glover... and when we're doing well, somewhere, we'll write. Wait a minute, George! Now, listen up! George Temple, has been a member loyal and valued of that community... and participates in that church... since the day you came here four years ago! I never knew he spoke ill of anyone! And that no one has spoken ill of him! It's not the kind of thing, to make a splash... but maybe some here don't know very well. But if you have had problems, in the last four years... they must know you very well. Because he was always ready to help, the way he could! Just... just ask Joe Fenwick. Ask Tucker. Ask me. Lou, this is not what George, George, don't worry. I talk to them. Does Cross Creek have that many good men... so you can lose George Temple so easily? Everything Lou said about George, I sign below! All! But... we have no choice! I lived in a small town like this, before I came here. One night a neighbor had a problem with a stranger. The stranger challenged my neighbor to a duel. But his revolver failed and my neighbor killed him. When they looked in his pockets, discovered that he, was Carl Mansfield, the fastest man in the territory. In a week, killers everywhere... went there to see, the fastest man, than Mansfield. They got drunk, scared the whole city... started fighting among them... and some people were injured. Well, this neighbor of mine... he was a great person, really a great man, very dear in the community... but... in the end, we had to ask him to leave town. That is what happened. I understand, Harvey. Suppose no one comes, to know what George did. The letters have not yet been sent... and the diligence will not come here again for three days. Now, suppose, that we never send them. Nobody will write or comment on what happened... don't even exchange a word, just a word with someone else! Could this be done? No, Lou, it wouldn't be that simple. But it could be done! Of course! Of course it could! What do you think, Doctor? George is right when he says that it will not be easy. On the other hand, everyone who knows the case, are in that church, now. Too many people to keep, a secret. I think I'm the biggest talker in town,... but I will keep my mouth shut. Just like me too! I'm with him! Me too! That's right! Me too! Wait a minute! Are you forgetting, than Harvey, said about what happened, in the other city. It won't happen here. Suppose someone speaks, by accident. It could happen by accident! And who could it be? You, Harvey? No not me. It won't be me! You bet on it! I'll swear! I swear to God, that no word on, what happened here yesterday it will never leave my lips. I think we should all swear too... one by one, all of us... including children, or anyone who is old enough to understand. I swear to God, I will never say, no word on, what happened yesterday. I swear to god. I swear to God I will never write or say anything... about what happened outside my bar, yesterday afternoon. I swear. I swear to God and this man. That I will never say anything to anyone. I think we can stay. You wanted to stay, didn't you? You... you didn't tell them everything. By God and by our friend George, here present. I told them everything that was needed. No, it had to be everything. I'll never say a word about what George Temple did yesterday. I swear to god! I declare, before God, that George's secret is safe with me. It's all right! There is no one here, just a boy! Ah...! Hey now! Have you seen anything, more invigorating than that? How long do you think they are from us? Two hours. Go to the stable and get fresh horses. Now! He said that we are more than two hours ahead of them. Why such a hurry? Okay, Vinnie. Okay, Vinnie, okay. In things like that, you really have to be very careful. It is certainly a very peaceful place. Where is everyone? At church? I'm talking to you, boy. Is everyone in the church? And why aren't you at church? I used to go to a church, like that, in the old days. My aunt took me. She was very religious. We went every Sunday. Do you know what is the only thing I remember? Do you know what is the only thing I remember? Which one? Of the Shepherd. There was always a drop of sweat running down his nose. He could say, that the drop was there. it dangled half hanging down and half up. We children always bet if... she would fall before the ceremony was over. I don't think I ever paid attention to the words I said. All because of that drop of sweat. You don't like to talk, do you? Hey, he has a wooden gun! Let me see it. The first weapon I had was made of soap. Do you train a lot? Look. Not the way I've always practiced. You are teaching him too well, Vinnie. It may still end up being faster than you. You will never be faster than me. I am perfectly comfortable with being the second fastest. I'm not the least bit bothered by this. Not even a little. Hey, kid. Come here. Do you know who is the fastest trigger in the world? No, no, you don't know. But I will tell you who it is. It's him. Not? He said no. That you're not the fastest. He's just a kid. You can't listen to a child, can you? Let me see that. The man who did this, what is his name? The man who claims to be the fastest trigger, what's his name? He won't say anything if you scare him like that! Son... did you see this man shoot the coins, hunm? Saw? Where? On here? On here? In this room? When? When did this happen? Come on, when? Yesterday. Now, listen to me Vinnie! We have other concerns today. We have no time to lose! Besides, the boy shouldn't even know what he's talking about. He probably made it all up. I swear I will never say a word about what Mr. Temple did yesterday. Where's Bobby? I don't see it. I swear, before God, I will never say a word... about what Mr. Temple did yesterday. You can let me look for him. One man stayed there and another man stayed there. So my father counted to three... and they threw the silver dollars up. How many shots did he shoot? Two. And how far was he? He was right there. Let's go back inside, boy. Come on. I saw "King" James try that, from half the distance. Half! And he was wrong. Nobody can do that. You are making it up. Someone told you. Not! I saw! What's his name? What is the name of this man? What is it? What's going on here? This place is closed. Who are you? You should be in the church. What are you doing here? He's entertaining us. He's telling us a story. He said that there is a very fast man in this city. No, no, it's not true. The boy talks a lot. He is very dreamy, he makes up things... You know what children do. What's his name? I can't tell you. Are you sure you can't? I can not. I gave my word. I swore. I'll count to three. A... Two... Fuck... What's the matter with you? Got crazy? He's fine, boy. Nothing was hurt. Your father is fine too. It looks like it was a shot! It came from the street! Brian is out there! Brian is out there! Hey, hey... It looks like a bandit. A real bad guy! What does he want? Let's find out now. We heard a shot! That's right. What happened? Ah... The boss is kind of crazy. Brian. Was it Brian? The boss didn't kill anyone. Not yet. And what do you want? There is a man in this city, there in the church, which is very good, with a gun. My boss wants to face you. He wants this man to go out that door and come down the street. He doesn't want anyone else to get out, just his trigger ace. Who said we have someone like that in town? The boy with the wooden revolver. He showed my boss those silver dollars. Bobby! They have my Bobby! No need to worry, Madam... the boy is fine. Nothing happened to him. The boss doesn't shoot children or dogs... mainly boys and dogs... And what happened to Brian? Now, tell him! He wants to face his ace on the trigger, see if it's really as fast as they say. As I told you before, he... is getting angry. He doesn't have much patience. So you better hurry up. He won't be waiting for long. Your boss... What's his name? Harold. Vinnie Harold. The man who killed Fallon? Himself. As I told you... we cannot wait, for long. They have three weapons. We have one! One weapon alone is not enough! It's enough for a man! I was ready to go, because I didn't want to cause them any problems. But you didn't let me go. You have to reconsider, George! Quick as you are, there will be no problem. I can guarantee that you are faster! Don't forget, I saw them both! I already said that I will never use a gun again. Remember, McGovern? I said a little while ago. One of them is coming down the street, with three horses harnessed! He got my calico! Look! It looks like they're running away! This means that they will not be here long. I think we can wait. Well, it looks like they're running away... I think we can wait here. What will they do with Brian? Let's all pray with me. I told you, that you are a fugitive. That can't wait too long. Did you see anyone? No, that I have seen before. I brought the horses. One is a very good calico. The others are not as good as the ones we left, but they serve. The piebald is mine. Ah!... I've already saddled him. Who is that? The owner of that place. I heard a shot... You talk too much. What are you looking at so closely? The church? What's in there? There is a trigger ace in the church and Vinnie is waiting for him to leave. Who is he? We do not know. Yeah... what if he doesn't leave? How long do you intend to wait? Why? There's a patrol behind us! Did you forget about the patrol? You said we had a two-hour lead. Our advantage is running out. We don?t have all this time. As you said, we don't have to be so careful. But I am telling you, that we cannot take that risk. Let's wait until the man leaves the church. Listen, if we don't get out of here, we'll be dead! I know... Well, then do something! Talk to him! It won't do! Do you remember the woman who ran away with that trader in El Paso? There is one thing, that you don't know. She was Vinnie's wife. Since then he has tried to prove something for himself. He needs to know that he is the best at everything! Shut up! Dink, you're knocking on the wrong door. Swope doesn't want me to lose this fight. You don't want me to lose, no fights. He wants to see me dead. He would try it himself, but he can't. He wants someone to do it for him. Or maybe today is the day. Perhaps. What is it? They are singing. Singing? Ah, well, I think, that no one will leave. We can go, can't we? He will leave. But they are singing! So, they will have to stop singing! Go to the warehouse! Take kerosene and soak all the buildings in the city! All buildings! What do you think you are doing? Do as I'm told! The church, too? All buildings! Go to the church, and give them my message. If the fastest trigger doesn't appear in five minutes, exactly five minutes... I will burn the city! You don't think a bunch behind us is enough. Come on! You know, until they don't sing badly. I told you that my boss doesn't have much patience... Now, I came here to tell you this: He wants his sniper on the street in five minutes,... or it will burn the city. Burn the city? How could he do such a thing? Why would he burn the city? It's like I told you before, he's going crazy! But it's our homes! Everything we have! He... he can't do that! Remember! You have five minutes! Five...! Joe Fenwick and son. Everything I have! It's all I have! You are to blame for all this, George Temple! You! Wait a minute. Wait. Listen. That's enough for me! He's the one to blame for all this. I think he should leave. A lot is at stake out there, George. You will cause our deaths too. We are not asking you for a very difficult thing to do. We have exactly four more minutes. Here they changed direction. They probably went to Cross Creek. I think they are trying to change the horses. Come on, men! Hear me out! They came here when they found out who he is! And they will burn the city for George. I say, what are we waiting for? I say we have to, we have to get him out! Wait a minute, Harvey! There is no other way, Lou! He has to leave! George... I will not move a finger to make you leave, nor a finger. I don't want to know who you are or what you do,... but I'm asking you to go outside and fight. I'm asking you for all of us. Dora, if there's any kind of promise he did to you, release him! He's under arrest, at his own will. It always has been. I've always hated guns too, George,... so I know how you feel. But you have the destiny of this city in your hands. Doc is right, George. A gun has put us in this situation... only a gun can get us out of it. This is not the time to think of ideals! It is not a matter of ideals! So, what is it, George? We have three more minutes. What's the matter, George? He is afraid. Fear! Fear? That's right. That's right! I... I'm scared. Is there anything wrong with being afraid to die? None of you are afraid? But you are the fastest! I'm the fastest! You've already killed six men! I never killed six men! I didn't kill. And those marks on your gun? Not! Has anyone of you heard of George Kelby? It was the Sheriff who cleaned "Abilene". That gun, with the marks on the stock, is his. It was George's father. Yes... that's right. That's right. I am George Kelby's son. My father worked with weapons, he was very good with them and very proud of what he did... He told me everything, that he knew about weapons... he even talked about me, he was faster than him. But there are certain things, which one man does not teach another. I never served against another man. That's it. The whole time he taught me, I hated guns, I hated them... That... Then, one day someone came and said: "A man thinks, that it's faster, than you and want to face him in a duel". Then you realize why you hate guns... because you feel fear and fear right here... dread! He told me, my father told me he could run if he wanted to... so go ahead, you can run if you want, but... whoever has the name Kelby always has to stay, always have to fight. So he stayed there, he fought and... then he was killed. But I... I couldn't even face my father's killer. I... They have a minute. Didn't they give a signal? Do not. But this time I'm going to force him out. Why are you doing this? Oh well... you can never know, when will we part... Dink! Get ready! Lit up! We have less than a minute. A man is already, with a torch! Oh, oh, oh... Excuse me! There must be something we can do! Something! And there is. Hi! Vinnie Harold! What you want? There is no need to set the city on fire! The man you want will be leaving soon! What do you want, Lou? I'll take George's gun and go outside. You are not fast, like Harold! It doesn't even come close! You have no chance, Lou. You cannot go outside. It would be suicide. We can't let you do that, Lou. I am solely responsible for George's staying here. I was the one who forced him to stay. I'll get my gun, Lou. But, George said he's scared... That's right. I'm so scared, I'm in pain in my stomach. George... Don't say a word, Lou. For one word, that's all I need to convince me not to do that. So don't say anything. George! George... You know I have to go outside, Dora. Otherwise, I will always carry this with me. What was this? It was Dink. He's gone. He took one of the horses and ran. Why didn't you stop him? There will be more money left for us. Vinnie Harold? There's a man standing at the church door. Is he armed? Brother! Brother! And how does he use it? You have one. I think you use it as if you know. It was about time, right? Yeah, I think it's about time. Withdraw! When I'm out there, I don't want you behind me, alone. Why don't you pull out your gun? If you don't want to cash out, go away! Leave it all there. I'm taking my share. Leave it all there! You can wait for me there, boy. You will see that I am the fastest. Did you shoot those silver dollars? Yes. And by what name do you know him? Kelby... George Kelby. We met, with Dink Wells and Taylor Swope. They didn't give us much of a choice. Are they both dead? They are. This guy, George Kelby, must have been really fast. He was the fastest man in the world. So, how did he get killed? He preferred it that way. "GEORGE KELBY JR." Killed by VINNE HAROLD November 7-1889 "VINNIE HAROLD" Killed by GEORGE KELBY JR. November 7-1889 You must be finding it funny to look, to your own grave! What's in there, Lou? Oh, just a coffin full of stones... and the reputation of the fastest man in the world. And the gun? It's there, too. Well, I think that makes it all right... I think we can go home now. "THE END"
