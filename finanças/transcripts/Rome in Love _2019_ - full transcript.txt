RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM I'm home. Hey. Hey. How's your day? Great, I've been dying for you to get home. I wanna read you this article. Okay. "Director Dominic D'Andrea has announced plans "for a remake for 'Roman Holiday' starring Jonathan Lyman." I love Jonathan Lyman. So do I, but this isn't about Jonathan Lyman. I don't get it. Just listen, "'Roman Holiday' "famously introduced audience to Audrey Hepburn, "and in keeping with the spirit of the original, "producers of the remake are conducting a worldwide search "for an unknown actress to play the lead." That's cool. You just download the script pages and submit a video. Could you imagine the thousands of people that are gonna audition for that? Yeah, so you should change your clothes. What, why? Why not? Because I'm not an actress. But you did "Barefoot in the Park" last year. That's community theater, and that was maybe for like 200 people. So, this would be an improvement. This is crazy. Amelia, you majored in theater in college. You did that web series. You wanted to be an actress. And then life took me in a different direction. Well, what if life is taking you in another direction now? Look, community theater in Bend, Oregon is one thing. A movie audition, I could humiliate myself. Or you could be brilliant. Come on, let's find out. It's 10 minutes out of your day. What have you really got to lose? You're not gonna give this up, are you? No, I'm not. Fine, fine. Stop. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. Relax, okay? Just have fun with it. Okay, okay, let's just do this. And go. Hi, I'm Amelia Tate, and I'm submitting for Princess Anna. That! Do you see it? She's wise but demure. Regal but without pretension. Bellissima. Yes, Dominic, we watched it four times now. Bring her in, she is the one. I shall fly her to Los Angeles for a screen test. I like it. Amelia Tate, got it, on the list. My instincts are never wrong, right Sophia? Mark my words, this will be our princess. Can you pass me the wrench? Thank you. Hello. Hello, I'm trying to reach Amelia Tate. She's kinda busy right, can I take a message? Yes, this is Sophia Lombardi from Pinnacolo Productions in Rome. Hold on. Amelia, you're gonna wanna take this. Okay. Hello. Is this your first time in Italy, Signorina Tate? Yes, it is. And what brings you? I'm here to film a movie. Really nice. I can come back late... Well, Philip, this is fabulous. Your description of the cuisine, the atmosphere, all the details. Makes me want to close up shop for the day and tour these cafes immediately. Well, thank you, Vivian. Yeah, I can run it on a long line edition. That pays 100 euros. 100? I spent more money on the food. Well then, you must have had a simply marvelous meal. To be honest with you, money's a little tight right now. Isn't it just? Look darling, you know I adore your writing, but there is simply no room in my budget for travel logs and short stories. Then give me an assignment. I'll take anything. Have you seen "Roman Holiday"? Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck? No. Well then, first of all, you absolutely must. Dominic D'Andrea is directing a remake with Jonathan Lyman and some mysterious new discovery. Now, they're keeping her under wraps until the big reveal next week at the press conference. You find me that actress, secure her first interview, and you might just have a cover story. So, a movie star profile? That's not really Vistoso's thing, is it? Correct, and that is why we're losing readers, and Celebrita magazine is picking them up. So, we adapt. Don't think of it as a celebrity profile, no, no, no. Think of it more as investigative reporting. Invest, I really wouldn't even know where to start with something like that. Well, you already have an in. I mean, all of Dominic's stars stay at the Hassler Hotel. Isn't that where you're bartending these days? I'm a porter, a waiter when they're short staffed. Well, fabulous, use your connections at the hotel. Go find me that actress. Amelia Tate, Sophia Lombardi, associate producer. We met at your audition in Los Angeles. Right, yes, I remember it. It's so nice to see you again. She speaks Italian. I spent the last three months trying to learn as much as I could. Dominic sends his regrets. There were obligations at the studio. Okay. Let's get you settled, yes? Yes. So, you have dinner with Dominic tonight at eight, here in the hotel at Imago. And I left the remainder of the day free for you to recover from the flight. I probably should, but I need to do some sightseeing. What would you like to see? Everything. I must stress the importance of keeping a low profile. No social media, no conversations about the film. Of course. Till you're introduced at the press conference with Dominic and Mr. Lyman. I'm doing a movie with Jonathan Lyman. Yes, you are, and you will be fantastic. Perfect timing. Buongiorno, Sophia. Buongiorno. This is Signor Petruzzi, your personal butler. Hi. A pleasure, Signorina. This can't all be for me. The Hassler Hotel wanted to extend a proper welcome. Filippo. Si, Signore. Signor Petruzzi will be on hand for anything your require. Sounds like you're a good person to know. I certainly try to be. I guess I'm gonna just get washed up and head out. Shall I draw you a bath, Signorina? Thank you, but I'm usually pretty good at doing that myself, but thank you. Of course, just ring the front desk if I can be of assistance, yes? I will, thank you. And I'll see you for Vespa driving lesson tomorrow afternoon. Yes, thank you again for everything. Filippo, come. Scusi. Kathryn, you're not gonna believe this room. Amelia, it's 5:30 in the morning. I know, I'm sorry, but I have to play it cool here, so you're the only person that I can freak out and call. You have to let me a little bit. I have a butler, a butler. Hold on, look at this view. Have you unpacked yet? Right side pocket of your suitcase. What's this? It's a map of Roman landmarks, sort of like a photo scavenger hunt. That way, it'll be like we're experiencing them together. This is so sweet. I'm gonna do this right after I take a bath. You have to see the bathtub, it's Italian marble. Okay, show me the tub. He's just there. Enzo, I was looking for you. Filippo, I thought you were off today. I'm just covering for a few hours. How was your meeting? Did you sell your story? Yeah, no, not really. Look, Dominic D'Andrea, the director, would you know him if you saw him? Of course. Okay. No. You. The tub! Can I please have Signor Petruzzi? Enzo, Filippo, a guest on the fifth floor has locked herself out with the bathtub running. Race you upstairs. Signorina, it was a pleasure drawing your bath today. Please don't make this any more embarrassing than it already is. Now, if you plan on leaving your room again today, I would suggest turning off all faucets before you go. Thank you. Hey wait, are you American? I am, but let's keep that between you and me. Enzo, Filippo, that will be all, thank you. Signorina. - Grazie. - Thank you. Thank you. - Signorina. - Thank you. In the future, I would be very happy to draw your bath for you. I promise you, despite all evidence to the contrary, I got it. I'm sorry, thank you. Good evening. Filippo. Ciao, Signora Richichi. Buongiorno, beautiful day, isn't it? It is. Ciao, Dante. Yeah, good boy. Well, Dante, that's more interesting than anything I came up with today. Filippo. I hate to interrupt a genius at work, but if you have some tea, I made some fresh biscuits. That's perfect. This genius needs a break. Good, we'll have it in the garden. Hey, Dante. Be good. I don't know, Signora, I think I'm just frustrated. I've been in Italy for about a year now, and I figured I'd have more to show for it. But you're upstairs all the time writing your novel. I'm hopelessly blocked. I haven't made any real progress on my novel in months. And the only real writing assignment that I've had lately is some pointless piece of an actress that no one's ever heard of. Signora, I'm starting to consider it might be time to pack up and go home. You want me to tell you want I think? Please. Try waking up in the morning smiling and say, "Oh, I wonder what the day will bring." Think of all the possibilities there are out there in life and about that story. You know it's gonna be a nice story because you're writing it, and you're my favorite writer. That's very kind, Signora. But one thing, you've never read anything that I've written. I know. Oh, come on. Buona sera. Pronto. Filippe. Grazie mille. Right now would be a very good time to stop by the restaurant. Thank you, Enzo. Excuse me, Signora, I have to go meet with a famous film director. The European adapters don't work in Italy. Why? Because we Italians must always do things in our own unique manner. Thank you. You're welcome. Do you require anything else? No, that's it. Okay. I think it's just nerves mostly. You know, the thing they don't tell you about getting the opportunity of a lifetime is that you are so afraid you're gonna make a mistake because chances like this, they don't come twice. Signorina, I know nothing of making films, but Dominic D'Andrea does. Now, he has excellent taste. I mean, if he believes you're the perfect actress for this role, what do you lose in presuming he's right? Why not assume everything is wonderful? Precisely. You, sir, would get along very well with my sister. She must be very wise. She would say so. Thank you. You're welcome. Buona sera, Signor D'Andrea, my name is Philip Hamilton. I'm a writer for Vistoso magazine, Italy's largest English-language publication. I am familiar. Right, of course you are. Do you mind if I sit down, sir? I do. Okay, I'm more than happy to stand. I am very interested in writing a profile introducing your leading lady of "Roman Holiday" to the world. Now, I've been living in Rome for about a year now, and I feel that a writer who has... Grazie. I'd very much appreciate the consideration on this. I would be more than happy to supply you with any writing samples if... Do not negotiate past a closed deal. I was with Vivian this afternoon, and we are giving the exclusive to Vistoso, and, from what I've been told, to you. Really? Well, that's great news. My actress, Amelia Tate, she's an American like yourself. Vivian suggested you could help put her at ease. She's never faced the press before. I will certainly do my best, sir. Here is my discovery now. Amelia. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Miss Tate, Philip Hamilton, Vistoso magazine. So you're a porter and a reporter? And of you promise not to mention that, I promise not to mention the whole bathtub story. Deal. Cool. Look at this, you're hitting it off already. So, my introduction to this reporter was as a woman who locked herself out of her room and then tried to flood the hotel. Dominic and Sophia'll be here any minute to give me a crash course on how to deal with the press. And speaking of crash, this afternoon, I get to learn how to ride a Vespa. Neat. Are you even listening? Amelia, it's nearly midnight here. You really need to start considering time zones. You're right, I'm sorry. Get some sleep, I miss you. I miss you too. You're gonna do great tomorrow, just be yourself. Thank you, love you. Love you too. Buongiorno, Amelia. Hi! Don't you look lovely. Thank you, can I get you guys anything? Juice, espresso? No, no, no, no, no, no. No, we can only stay for a moment. Okay. So, today is your first interview. Now remember, anything that you say about yourself or your friends or your family will be read by the entire world. So, you must exercise care. - Okay. - Without appearing to be guarded. 'Cause otherwise, he may think you're hiding something. Just be your own natural, delightful self. But also vigilant and charming. And prepared. But not over-rehearsed. No. And you'll be great. Okay. Perfetto. Let's go. Filippo. Vincent, ciao. Celebrita magazine send me. I'm supposed to find Dominic D'Andrea's new leading lady? That's interesting. Do you mind? So, are you on assignment? Me? Oh no, I'm just making some notes on my novel. Worked the overnight shift, about to head home. You know, I did see Dominic earlier with a beautiful woman, I think the caught a car to Tiberino Restaurante. On Tiber Island? That's the one. The traffic would be impossible at this hour. Well, the you better hurry. Yes, thank you, Filippo. Prego. Mr. Hamilton. Please, call me Philip. Amelia, officially. So, I know that we are doing this interview, but I really, really, really wanna do a little sightseeing. Is there any way that we could both? - Sure. - Is that okay? No, it's fine. Not unprofessional? No, no, let's go. Gelato for breakfast, I like your style. It's a special occasion. My first big interview. Actually no, that's a lie, the local paper in Bend interviewed me when our softball team won regionals. Well then, I am honored to land your second big interview. So, you're originally from Oregon? Yes, I was born in North Bend, and then we moved to Bend, which, fun fact, is north of North Bend. And what do your parents do? My dad was in the Coast Guard, and my mom was in Human Resources. Is that what they still do? If it's all right, I'd like to keep my family out of the story as much as possible to maintain their privacy. I see. Do you really pretend not to speak English when you're working at the hotel? Only around Americans. Why? Well, I'm a collector of stories, and you would be amazed what people will say in front of you if they think that you don't understand. Clever. How did you end up here? Same as you, I guess. Took a chance, got on a plane. What about you, do you travel a lot? Not really. So, you performed with a community theater back in Oregon? I did, I do. Any favorite roles? Five years ago, I played Meg in Little Women. Okay. I always wanted to play Jo though. She's the scrappy one who craves adventure, but I think all Megs secretly want to be Jos. Look at you now, you found your adventure. It appears I have. It's kind of what I'm hoping to bring to Princess Anna in Roman Holiday. Do you have a favorite scene? Yeah, the scene where Princess Anna, she runs away from home and she meets the journalist and then they go on that brief holiday in Rome. You haven't seen it, have you? I have not, no, but I do intend to. No wonder Shakespeare loved Italy. Did you ever do any Shakespeare? I did, in college, we did The Merchant of Venice, and I played the Prince of Morocco. We were short on guys. So, you have experience playing royalty. Yes, I suppose I do. And you were in college for three years, is that correct? That sounds about right. Okay look, if you don't want to do the interview, I wish you would just say so. What? You're dodging and evading. You haven't given me a straight answer on anything besides the roles that you've played on stage. I don't think that's true. Now, you're being evasive about being evasive. Philip, I've been cast in a movie, shouldn't the conversation be about my prior work experience? Actually no, no, this is a fluff piece about an actress where you talk abut how proud her mom and dad are, and then she throws in some happy little unexpected detail about your stamp collection. Well, I'm not talking about my parents, and I don't collect stamps. Well then, I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here. It doesn't sound like you wanna be here very much doing a fluff piece about an actress. Well, that might be so, but you still don't have to treat me like the enemy. They told me you were. Who did? Dominic and Sophia this morning. They didn't say that exactly like that. I just, I'm new at this. I don't know how to be careful but unguarded and vigilant and delightful all at the same time. Yeah, that would be challenging for anyone. I'm sorry, I just. What I mean is that I have a life and people back in Oregon, and I booked this movie, not them, so I'm just trying not to disrupt their life any more than absolutely necessary, and I just, can you appreciate that? I can. I want this to be a good interview, I do, I just... Okay, look, how 'bout this? You promise to be candid and honest with me. I'll write the story, and before I turn it in, I'll let you read it. Anything you're uncomfortable with, we can discuss. You can do that? You know, sooner than you'd like, you're gonna have very little control over what people write about you. I'm here to help you introduce yourself to the world. If you'll allow me. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. And for the past eight years, I've been happy just managing a coffee shop and doing community theater in my hometown. I've forgotten what it feels like to reach for something... Something more? Not something more, something unfamiliar. It's scary. Maybe now it's time. Maybe. Time, time, what time is it? One o'clock. We have to go, I'm gonna be so late for my lesson. Come on. What lesson? Let's try one more time. - Okay. - Okay? Be gentle on the throttle, just, that's right. Okay. - Steady. - Step by step, okay? - Slowly, slowly. - Okay. Let's go. Okay, yup. - All right. - Okay. That's good. That's good. Brava! Quite the discovery, isn't she? Yes, she is. This way. Okay. That's really good. That's good. And that is it. I did it. - That's good. - You did it. So, shall we try it with someone else? Hop on. No, take her. Oh, oh no, you go. Come on, trust me. Okay. Cute. Is it? You're so heavy. - Okay. - Same thing. Wee, ooh! Wait, where are you going? Amelia, what do you do instead? You were perfectly safe the whole time. I don't know why you freaked out. Well sure, you say that now, but you didn't know at the time. I thought you weren't much of a risk-taker. Well, I didn't think I was. Filippo. Oh brother, just follow my lead. Okay. I spent all day searching for Dominic and this mystery woman. No luck, you haven't seen him, have you? No, sorry, I've been out most of the day. I've got a friend visiting from college. Vincent Viverito of Celebrita magazine, this is my dear friend, Jo March. Jo March from Massachusetts. A pleasure to meet you, Signorina March. Welcome to Rome. Thank you. Filippo, you see Dominic, you call me, okay? Will do. Okay, thank you. Jo March, really? You're not a Meg, you're a Jo. See you tomorrow? I don't know what came over me. I just felt like I wanted to keep driving, so I kept driving. Such a daredevil. You should've seen Philip's face. I thought he was gonna have a heart attack. Philip's the reporter. I know. Anyway, tomorrow, I meet my stylist. You're getting a stylist? Of course, I'm getting a stylist. Have you seen my wardrobe? Hey, did you remember to register for fall classes? It's due Friday. Amelia, stop. This is the beginning of a new chapter for the both of us. You're on this grand adventure, and I'm finally gonna be treated like an adult. I'm sorry, old habits. Get some sleep, and say hi to that cute reporter for me. I never, I don't think I ever said that he, cute. Survived by her daughters, Amelia and Kathryn. And then I received a call from the editor of Celebrita magazine furious Vistoso landed the interview. It really was quite satisfying. I bet. So, I hope you can assure me that she's a compelling interview. She is. Great. Come on, tell me something exciting. Exciting? Exciting's not the right word. She's engaging. She's intriguing. Yes well, these really aren't words that sell newspapers, Philip, you know? Give me some drama, foes vanquished, heartache, that sort of thing. I think that's all there. I just, I still need to earn her trust, she's new at this. Well I am not, and I need something more than intrigue. The blue dress was perfect, I think. Would you, right? Buongiorno. - Buongiorno. - Ah, our American reporter. You're just in time for the big reveal. Everything running smoothly? The script is exquisite, the production will be favoloso. But do you know what the secret ingredient is? The one element that truly determines a classic? No, what is it? Casting. It all comes down to casting. Bellissima. It's incredible. Yeah, it is. Is that the line to get in? That's it. You'd think for a half a building it'd be half the wait. You know, there's a park nearby if you don't mind walking. No. Thank you. I did some research on you last night. What'd you find? Rave reviews on your performance in "The Man Who Came to Dinner." Oh, yeah, well hey, that was one of my triumphs. Also, I read about your mother. Right. You were 20? 21. I took a semester off to help. You know, take Mom to radiation, take Kat to school. When it was clear that I needed to stay, I stayed. And that's why you never pursued a career in acting. I had a 13-year-old sister who lost both parents, I needed to be there. I'm not sure how much of that I want in the story. If that's okay? We don't have to decide today. Is that? Signor Petruzzi! Ah, Filippe, Signorina Tate! What a lovely surprise. I'm sorry, scusi, this is my wife, Tina. A pleasure. Amelia. Where are you headed? Back to the hotel, I have a script to study. Ah, si, si, yes. Have you eaten? - No. - No? Well then, you must come to the house. We're having a small gathering and... Oh, no, no, - we wouldn't want to impose. - No, it's just family. No, no really. It's not imposition if you're invited. Come on, insist. Yeah. Yeah, sure, thanks, can I help you? Thank you very much. So, where have you been? Oh god, I've been everywhere. Oh no, I don't know. Yeah! Filippo, bravo, 'Lippo! So wait. Mamma, my, my! Grazie, grazie. What do you say we go play a quick game? Let's go play a game. Come on, let's go. You come too. Sure, okay. What? High five! Try it? - No. - All right. - I mean... - You wanna try it again? Don't they make a lovely couple? The worst game I've ever seen. I know. Thank you for another fine day. I feel like we didn't get much work done. I picked up a few things. Will I see you tomorrow? No, no, you are off the hook. Cool. Yeah, I have to work my other job at the restaurant. Well, I have dance rehearsal, so all day I'm learning to waltz. Ah, well, good luck. Thank you. Goodnight, I guess. Goodnight. Buongiorno, Signora! I'm a writer, I've written! Good boy, Filippo. I don't know what came over me, Signora. I just spent the entire night writing. I haven't done anything like that in years. I just suddenly saw these new details so clearly. It just, these twists and these turns. It was thrilling, Signora. I can't stop shaking though. I think I might've had too much espresso. I'm very proud of you, Filippo. And what brought on the change? I don't know. I had a really good day. - Good! - You know what? I need a shower and a nap, but before I go, Signora, what is the most appropriate flower for wishing someone good luck? Ah, Filippo, let me think on that for a second. Daffodil, definitely daffodil. It announces a new beginning. New beginnings, that's it, grazie mille. Okay, ciao. It's right. Amelia, thank you. Around. Around. Around. Philip, hi. I'm sorry. I was just on my way to work the lunch shift, and I thought I'd stop by and say hi. Oh, well, let's see what you got. Okay. Nice flowers. Thank you. They're for you, daffodils, new beginnings. Thank you. They were supposed to be for luck, but it doesn't look like you need any. Well, for that, you can credit Darla Smith's Dance Academy in Bend, Oregon. I'm sure she'll appreciate the free advertising. Well, I will make note. You're not so bad yourself. Thank you, my grandmother made me take lessons because she wanted a proper dance partner for my sister's wedding. You learned to waltz for your grandma? I did. That's the cutest thing I've ever heard. That is exactly how she sold it to me too. She said the girls would love it. By the way, I think you're leading. You're welcome. Sorry, sorry. I'll see you later? Yeah, I'll let you get back to it. Okay. - See you. - Bye. Again. Thank you. So, Philip says the story will run on Tuesday, and other outlets should pick it up pretty quickly. This is exciting. Yes and no. You know, that means four more days of privacy only. I tried to keep your name out of the story as much as possible, but I don't know, you might have to deal with some reporters. Amelia, will you chill out? If people wanna find out more about you, why shouldn't they? You're a fascinating person. Stop worrying so much. And it seems like that Philip character you always mention is looking out for you. Yeah, I think he is. And I do not constantly mention him. He just happens to be around all the time working. Stop laughing. Kat, goodbye. Sit, please. Thank you. So, I was told that you were as a graceful as a swan in today's rehearsal. I had a very patient choreographer, but I appreciate you saying so. That's humble, I like it. My friend here will take the almond granita. That is delicious, you will love it. Okay. Signore D'Andrea, I... Dominic, please. Dominic, I just wanted to thank you again for this opportunity. I intend to make you very proud. It was an unexpected benefit from a delicate situation. What do you mean? We brought many names, established names to Jonathan Lyman, but he would approve none as his co-star. "Roman Holiday" is more Joe's story than the princess, no? Why, you're asleep on the sofa for 1/4 of the film. Right. But the audience, they will adore you. Everyone loves a princess, no? And you'll be beautiful on screen. Hi, Vivian. Your story goes live in four days immediately after the press conference. I'm aware. And I have yet to see one single word. Well, I'm still sorting out what I can include and what I can't. What do you mean, what we can't? What I mean is what would make for the most interesting story. Philip, you're not giving her approval, are you? Of course not. Because we don't do that. Right. If I found out that one of my writers did that, I would... I understand. No, no, no, let me finish, please. Fire him? I would fire that writer. Of course. So, a draft tomorrow. Not tomorrow, I still need to interview Dominic this afternoon. Then you will bring me your notes. You know, I need some proof that I will have a story ready to run on Monday. Well, Dante, looks like we're in a bit of a mess. You again. You following me? Hi. No, I'm interviewing Dominic and Sophia. What about you? I'm here to get fitted for a special outfit for the press conference. By the way, my copy of the original "Roman Holiday" came in today. I'm thinking about watching it tonight. Well, I'm excited to see your reaction. Well, we can watch it together if, I mean, if you wanted. That could be fun for the story. So good for the story. Okay, sure. Leave address with the front desk, and I'll see you at seven? Seven's great, sure. I'll just go to the market after I'm done here and pick up a few things to, you know, feed you. You don't have to do that. No, it's fine, it's easy. I'll just throw a couple things together. If you're sure. Nothing. Yeah, okay, all right. Well, I'll see you then. See you. Bye. There you are. Did you get everything on the list? Si, Signora. Chianti? Si, Signora. Fresh basil? Si, Signora. Look, if it's not fresh, you're gonna go right back to the market. It's fresh, it's fresh. Okay. Can I try? Okay, of course, yeah, go. - That's good? - Good, yeah, right. Good, good, good, good. You're getting the hang of it. A little bit more. Okay, now these are little pieces that we have cut. - Okay. - Okay? Remember that you rolled out? We take little things like this. Just the right amount, and you roll it like that. I see. - See? - Okay. - You go ahead. - Okay. Now, not too big. Two. Three. Roll it over, good, good, good, good, good. There you go. You get the air come out, perfect. Not too close, okay? They have to be squares and not rectangles. Yeah, good. Perfect. - Look at that. - There you go! Good. Filippo, remember to open the Chianti. It needs to breathe. Yeah, it's open. She's gonna be here any minute. Hey, Dante. Come here, kitty, come here. I think this is the best ravioli I've ever had. Really? I'm glad you like it. It's the fresh tomatoes. Hey, Dante. Where'd you find Dante? When I first moved into this place, I heard some meowing outside, so I opened the door to check and Dante just walked right in and made himself at home. I put posters up all over the neighborhood, but no one claimed him. Because he claimed you. I guess you're right. So Amelia, tell me, I understand your father was a sailor. Sort of, he was in the Coast Guard. My first big love was a sailor. I thought your husband was a butcher. Mr. Richichi was my third big love, my third husband, and if there's a fourth, you never know. What about your second? That's another story. So, what'd you think? It was good. I thought it was a good movie. Are you crying? No, I'm not crying. Anyway, can I make you an espresso? I'd offer you a cappuccino, but I have no idea how to make one of those. Oh well, luckily, you know a professional. New froth. And then, you have cappuccino. Ecco. So, I'm still waiting for your review of "Roman Holiday." Okay, I liked it, I loved it. It was a great movie. I just, I didn't expect such a downer ending. What? But that's, that's the whole reason that Anna's holiday is rare and special. They couldn't ever actually be together. It was never meant to last. Yeah, I get that. It's just, it was kind of a downer. Actually, you know, the movie that we're doing, originally, Dominic wanted to change it. He wanted to surprise the audience with a happy ending. Thank God we are sticking to the original. So, that's your preference? Yeah. Just because it ends doesn't mean it's not a love story. That's true. Does your book have romance? Maybe. Does it end happily? Time will tell. Until lately, I've been pretty stuck. Stuck on what? I don't know. Well, there has been marked improvement lately. What changed? I sort of just gave myself permission to see what the day would bring, to just be open to new possibilities, and then things just started happening, you know? Apparently, it's not always a bad idea to divert from the path. I know what you mean. Before I graduated, I was accepted into a performing arts program in London, and that's the exact path I would've chosen for myself, 100%, but then everything that happened happened, and I spent so long, years just wondering, "What if?" You know, and I don't know, everything would've been so different. I wouldn't have the amazing relationship that I have with my sister, and you know, I wouldn't be here right now. And are you happy right now? Yeah, I'm pretty happy right now. So, can I read your book? Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Okay, okay, okay. The first 73 pages. Now, you're its first audience, so you need to be forgiving. I know the feeling. "Rome in Love." Working title. I like it. Good evening, gentlemen. Do you need a car, Signore. No, thank you. Do you work for the hotel? No sir, all private companies. So, you collect your own fares? Yeah. Have any of you recently had a fare that was charged to Pinnacolo Productions? Yes, sir, an American woman. So, tell me everything you remember. Okay. Okay. Pronto. Well, well, well, the infamous Philip. This is Kathryn Tate. Well, that was fast. I know, I'm up way too late. So, you're looking for some Amelia stories. Well, my friend, you've come to the right place. Tito knew he should answer the knock. The life he prayed for was waiting on his doorstep. All he had to do was open the door, and yet. Hmm, and yet what? That's all he wrote. No, no, no, does Tito open the door? I don't know! Get Filippo on the phone, ask him. Do you see why I got no sleep last night? Filippo must finish this book. - I know he... - You will see him today? No, tomorrow. Today, I have a photo shoot. I'm gonna see myself as a princess. Ah, you are beautiful. Yeah, that's what they've been telling me. Okay, so when she had to leave school and forgo the move to Europe. I don't know what you mean. The training program in London. Amelia was accepted to school in London? You know what, I might have my details mixed up. No. I don't think you do. I'm seeing a bit of tension in your jaw. Can you relax your face a bit. Okay, wonderful. Your face, over here. Number four. Getting her to take a few pictures. Let's try to loosen up the face a bit. Okay. Could we stop for a moment? Okay. So, how were we today? I'm okay, bit of a headache, but I'll be fine. And what else? Nerves probably. And what else? Nothing. I see. I don't think he meant anything by it, but... What did Dominic say? Signor D'Andrea. Excuse me. - Si. - A word. Grazie. Amelia. Signor, I've been thinking about what you said the other day, and I was afraid to say anything because I didn't want you thinking that I was just another actor with a big ego. - Not at all... - Please. We're telling a love story, and from what I understand, a love story involves two people standing on equal footing. - I agree. - Right. But Princess Anna is the heart of this story, and I want to do that justice. I'm sorry if you think that I shouldn't be or I'm stepping out of line, but I just, I needed... I appreciate your candor, Signorina Tate. Shall we get back to work? Yeah. Sure. Amelia, we do not apologize for insisting that our work be respected, okay? Be still my beating heart. Word count? Just shy of 1,600 words. Sourced. Her sister, two co-workers, a college classmate, and her high school drama teacher, and there's already a digital copy in your inbox. Fabulous. For goodness sake, Philip, it's not a sacred relic. I have one more appointment with her tomorrow to do some last-minute fact checking. If you wouldn't mind just holding off on the final edit until I do that. Is it awful? What? No. Because your behavior suggests that it was really quite terrible. It's a very good piece of writing, if I do say so. Then why so morose? It's just that I know how much she values her privacy, and I can't help but feel like we're the people putting an end to it. Oh no, no, no, no, dear boy. We are the people helping to promote a major theatrical release in which she chose to take a starring role. You're right. But news sensitivity is encouraging. That's very kind of you to say, Vivian. Oh, no, it's the truth. I do not give unearned praise, I'm British. So, final draft at 6:00 p.m. Amelia. Signore D'Andrea. Did we have an appointment? We did not. Please. Hey. You see, when a man has been a fool, it is best to let him face it. Amelia, I fear that I have led you to believe that I think your performance, your abilities, your craft are less than essential. Forgive me. We need you in this, this film, we need you. Thank you. Her? Si, Signor. The star of "Roman Holiday" is Jo March. Good morning, Vivian. Well, it's fantastic. What is? Well, the Amelia Tate story, of course. You have crafted a hero's journey, no, no, better than that, a heroine's journey. You were right about her. She is intriguing, exciting. I mean, giving everything up for her sister. All that stuff about her serving coffee just to make ends meet. Yeah, she's something else, isn't she? I'll get an intern to fact check. No. What I mean is that's not necessary because I already have an appointment with her in a few hours. Enjoy your Sunday, hmm? Celebrate your success. Don't you look at me like that. I'm gonna show it to her tonight. She's gonna read it, she's gonna understand. She's gonna sign off on the whole thing. Good morning. Good morning. That's an adorable car. It's a rental. I figured it would be nice to get out of the city for the day. Where are we going? First stop, best view in Rome. Okay. So, I'm hesitant to ask... What took you so long? I thought you were gonna bring it up in the car. I'm not gonna bring it up if you don't bring it up. Philip, your book is amazing. I read it all in one sitting, and then I reread my favorite parts to Petruzzi, which I realized I did not ask permission for, and for that, I apologize. No, that's fine, I'm just surprised. I didn't think you'd like it that much. I did, I loved it, and so did he. Do you mind if we talk about the story for a minute? Your story about me? Yeah. Can we wait until we get back to the city? It's so nice just to be checked out with a friend for a minute. Sure. You ready for the next stop? Sure. Signora Daniels. Vincent Viverito, I thought I smelled cheap cologne. Amelia Tate, works in a little coffee shop, does amateur theater. Well, well, well. Someone's learned to google. Your story runs Tuesday. Mine will be online in the next hour. Just look at you. Enjoy your desert. One moment. Dominic, hi, it's Vivian Daniels. Listen, if you want our exclusive to remain exclusive, we have to run right away. Do you have any service? No, no, not even a bar. We probably won't have any until we get back in the city. That is fine. Thank you. Grazie. So, there aren't any menus? No menus, whatever the family makes for dinner is what we're eating. How'd you find this place? Well, when I first moved to Italy, I would travel to these little villages, and I would just ask people to show me their favorite place to eat. Smart. Every travel piece that I have ever written can be summed up as, ask a local. That is so true. If you ever come to Bend, I'm gonna take you to this place that serves peanut butter tacos. They're a lot better than they sound. I'll defer to the local on that one. So, do you see yourself going back to Oregon? As opposed to what? Hollywood. That's where all the movie stars live. Did they not tell you that? Shut up. What about you? Think you'll stay in Rome once your novel becomes a best-seller? That's a good question. This whole idea of just seeing what they day will bring, I think I'm gonna keep rolling with that for a while. It's given me a lot to be grateful for. Sweet. Listen, Amelia, when you read the article... No, please, we have the whole ride back to the city for that. This is so perfect, please. Okay. Thank you. Have you practiced your waltz today? - No. - Come on. Come on. Are you gonna let me lead this time? This isn't a waltz. I think you might be right. So, am I gonna see you once the story's published? I hope so. I know how busy you're gonna be, but you're more than welcome to stop by and make me a perfect cappuccino whenever you want. Oh, can I? Well, now that we're back, I did bring a copy of the story for you to read. Should I be worried? No. No, it's just, in the same way that you find out about the best restaurants by talking to a local, you find out about... What's going on at the hotel? I don't know. You know what, I bet Jonathan Lyman just arrived. Ah, yeah, that could be it. But why don't I drive around back just to be safe? No, no, I'll get out here, I'll get us a table. You get a parking spot, and then we'll go over the story. Are you sure? It'll just take a second. Yeah, it's not like they're waiting for me. It won't take long. - It's fine. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm already here. Rome. - Signorina Tate! - Miss Tate! Signorina Tate! Signorina Tate! Signorina Tate! Mm, thank you, but I'm okay. I was just startled. I don't know how that happened. Celebrita magazine, it had to be them. They were offering bribes to the hotel staff. Oh, is this what it's gonna be like? The best thing you can do is just refuse to engage them. Well, Filippo, your story certainly found an enthusiastic audience, but next time, a little bit more warning, yes? I mean, there are protocols here. Oh no, Signor, my article doesn't run until Tuesday. No, I read it a few hours ago. It's actually very good. You released your story. No, no, no, I was with you. I have no idea what's happening. You said that I could read it first and that we would discuss it. Yeah, I... You said I could trust you. You could and you can. What did you say? What did I say? All of the, how could you do this? Amelia, I am so sorry, but I... You knew I had a sister. I gotta go. Wait. You know, Signorina, forgive me, but you know, he truly captured your essence in this profile. It is written with admiration and affection. Thank you. It's not the point. We were supposed to agree on what information would be shared. I trusted him more than I should, more than I meant to. I just feel so betrayed, you know? Understood. Can I get you anything else? No, thank you, you're very kind. Oh, come on, Kathryn. Door is open. Filippo, Filippo. Oh, I didn't know. Signora, what's wrong? Your words, her life, so much beauty, so much tragedy, so much love. You read the article. Yes, I did, and I was overwhelmed. Thank you. But I betrayed her trust. But Filippo, there were so many things that happened beyond your control. They were never in my control, and I should've told her so. She will forgive you. And if she can't? I saw the look and the gestures between the two of you at dinner, hmm? If a man ever looked at me like that, I think I will have found my love number four. Amelia's heart is hurting, but hearts can be mended. So, give her time. No, give her flowers. Give her hyacinths and lily of the valley. Noted. Your butler's kinda cute. Kathryn! What, how did, what is going on? You should know I could only afford a one-way ticket. Oh my. I have no idea how I'm getting home. I missed you. What are you doing here? I answered questions for Philip's profile, and it all seemed a little intense, so I thought I'd be here to support you. But then the story dropped early, and when I got off a 15-hour flight, you were internet famous. My taxi driver said you were an inspiration. Hold on, Philip contacted you? I'm pretty easy to find, Facebook, Insta, Twitter. He didn't ask my permission to do that. Amelia, I wanted to talk about you, about our family, our relationship. I'm proud of our story. Aren't you? Of course, I am. Why would you even ask me that? Why didn't you tell me you got the chance to study in London? I never wanted you to feel like I gave something up to come home. Of course you did, you gave up everything. No, I didn't. None of that stuff was meant to happen. Being there for you and growing up with you, that's the most important thing I've ever done in my life. There's nothing, not one thing, that would have been better or would have made me happier. God, I'm gonna cry. Please don't cry, no, no, no, no. If you cry, then I'm gonna cry, and I think I have to be ready in like two hours for this press conference. Before you do, I need you to hear this. What you did for me, it's extraordinary. And there are so many people who have to be there for their families when the worst happens, and they're not celebrated like they should be. When they read this story, the one that you're super mad about right now, they're gonna feel seen, and they're gonna know that wonderful things can happen for them too. That's why I wanted everyone to hear about you. When did you get so wise? Now, you be a good boy and behave, okay? You know that there's no guarantee that she'll even talk to me. There's no such thing as guarantee in life, what a silly thing to ask for. That's true. Now, you go to her and you tell her that she's beautiful. Okay. No, no, wait a minute. Tell her that she's magnificent. And then tell her the three words that every woman hopes a man will say to her. And those would be? "I was wrong." He's a good boy. I ordered room service while you were in the shower. Okay. Buongiorno, Amelia. Sophia, hi. Hello, come in. Your gown squad has arrived. Cool. Buongiorno. - Hi. - Buongiorno. - Buongiorno. - Buongiorno. Hi, hi, come in. Oh my god, this is so cool. This is Sophia Lombardi. She's one of our associate producers on the film. This is my sister Kat, she flew in to surprise me. Kathryn, your comments about Amelia in Vistoso, so heartfelt. Thank you. I should probably read it. You still haven't read it? Amelia darling, we really must get you into makeup now. Okay, sure. I'll get it. Hi, I'm looking for Amelia Tate. Who is it? I'm sorry, my manners, I'm Jonathan Lyman. Hey. Jonathon, hi, it's so nice to see you again. It's good to see you too. Seems a lot has changed since our screen test. That's an understatement. I've just been reading all about you. Yeah, well, I'm getting that a lot today. See, now I understand what people mean when they say they feel like they know me already. And don't get me wrong, I know that I have so much more to learn about you, but wow, the Vistoso story was such a great preview. Thank you, I am flattered. Okay, I need to know the truth. Did you really steal the Vespa from your training and take it on a joy ride? I didn't steal it so much as expanded the training course a little bit. You see, Sophia? This is exactly why I told Dominic that I wanted my co-star to be an undiscovered talent. Because I want the audiences to feel the same way they did seeing Audrey Hepburn for the first time, just witnessing that raw emotion, witnessing the arrival of somebody new and amazing. And that's you, Amelia. I have been fielding emails and phone calls since last night. They're quite complimentary. That's nice. Is she speaking to you yet? Like you said, it's not important. Of course, I said that. Now, now, I'm invested. Signora Richichi, what are you doing here? I had to find out how it ended. How did you get in? Pure charm. I'm nervous. Amelia, I know all of this is a lot, it is, trust me, I was here years ago. And the trick, if there is one, is just continue to surround yourself with people who see through everything, past it all to who you are and who you've always been. That's what real, that's what matters. I mean, the rest of all this, this is just playing pretend. Okay, you ready? I'm actually gonna do one final check, and I'll meet you down there. Okay. Okay, thank you. That man is ridiculously charming. Right. Okay. Kathryn! Kat, I think there's something wrong with the door. You're going to get asked questions about the article at the press conference. I've left a copy of it by the sink, and I'm not opening the door until you've read it. Kathryn, this isn't a joke. I need to be down there. If you're going to insist on being mad at him, then you should at least know what you're so mad about. Oh no, they're coming right now. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us for today's event. We will be welcoming the creative team momentarily, thank you. Did you finish? I finished. And you get it? I get it. Good 'cause they've sent your butler to retrieve you. Are you ready, Signorina? Yeah. What drew me to "Roman Holiday"? I love that it's unabashedly romantic. Those are the movies that I grew up with, and they taught me how to be a gentleman, the rituals of courtship, and I still think that those stories have a place today. Centro. Jennifer Leeds for Sunrise USA. Amelia, what's been your favorite thing about Rome so far? Well, the food, for one. The people. The people I've met in Rome are some of the kindest that I've ever met. So, do as the Romans do because they are doing it right. Thank you. Good answer. Back row. Philip Hamilton, Vistoso. Ciao, Filippo. Dominic, I was wondering if there's any truth to the rumor that you'd considered changing the ending? Let the couple stay together? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we would never. If I could add to that? This story that we're telling in this film is about two people who meet in extraordinary circumstances, and they feel the spark of something wonderful, and they bring out the best in each other, but ultimately, it's not meant to be. Thank you. Okay, we have time for one more. Si. So, you're the writer. How would you change the ending? Well, this journalist character, it sounds like he made some promises that he couldn't keep. So, we should probably begin with an apology. It's a good start. Amelia, I just wanted the world to see you the way that I do, to know how remarkable you are, and the sacrifices that you have made. I think you are so brave and stunning and funny and kind, and yeah, I agree that there's some beauty in a story about two people that aren't meant to be together, but in life, I wanna fight for a happy ending. I wanna be the happy ending that you deserve, and you are magnificent. And I was wrong. How were you wrong? I'm not entirely sure, but I was specifically advised to tell you that. It wasn't your fault. You didn't know the story was running, and you did your best to protect me. It was a beautiful story. It was easy. You inspired me, and I got to introduce the world to Amelia Tate. Sorry, these are for you. Thank you. Look, Philip, this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and I don't know how it happened. I mean, I can't believe it, and I don't really know what I'm doing. Amelia, you are going to be amazing in this movie. I'm not talking about the movie. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
