- I watch Bella. - Not anymore. I knew you was up to no good. But going after your own sister? Shame on you. What? You're talking crazy. Look, Veda is a liar. You can't trust anything she says. - Get out of the way! - Get off me! Uh! Get off of me! Ah! No... Is that you, mama? -I'm so sorry. -Look. I ain't got no money to put my mama in the ground, okay? Honey, I'm not here for that. But I'm sure there are some people that will help you bury your mother. If you leave her to the state, you will never know what happened to her. I know what happened to her. She hustled, then she died. Keisha, you supposed to be sleepin'. Mama? I told you, don't call me mama. Kids in my class were laughing at me because I have no daddy. You don't. Daisy, everybody's got a mama and a daddy. Ms. Burgess said so. If your teacher says so, then it's true. Everybody's got a daddy. Everybody except you. What do I want you to remember? "His Name is Jehovah, sing praises to Him. A father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows." You got a mother and you got God. Ain't nothing else matter. "Elijah Wilson." "My dearest Elijah..." -Excuse me. -Wait! You left this. God forgot me a long time ago. Now it's my turn. Elijah Wilson... "Elijah Wilson is the proud father of Gabrielle Flores." What a cute little girl. I have a confession. My dearest Elijah. Mommy, can you fix my hair? -Ah... -Ooh. Come on, I worked really hard on those. I'm sure you did, babe. It's okay, daddy. They're not as bad as the last time. -Ah. -Oh, come here, honey. -I'm sorry. -Oh. Hey, guess what? I was able to get us a reservation at Chez Casmimir for tonight. Dinner, dancing. Maybe make the B-A-B-Y we've been talking about. That you've been talking about. -But I can't tonight. -Oh, come on, baby. It took me weeks to make this reservation. It's okay. Sorry, babe. Uh, big fires at work. Sorry. There's always gonna be something. Well... I'll make it up to you. I promise. Oh, I like the sound of that. Hey, um, have you heard from daddy? He hasn't returned my texts in the last two days. Well, that's interesting. We were supposed to watch the game yesterday, but he never answered my calls. I'll swing by his place after work. All right. Bye, honey. Hey. It's not much better than what I did. -Uh, yes, it is. -All right. -It's better than what I did? -Yes. -Whatever. Come on. -Sorry, daddy. Daddy? It's Gabby. Gabrielle? Daddy, what's going on? Are you okay? Gabrielle, Gabrielle, Gabrielle. I would never do anything to hurt you or the memory of your mother. I know. Of course, daddy. Many years ago when you were very young... I had an affair. Life on the road was hard. There were months I barely saw your mother. I d... I don't... You and mom were happy. We loved each other very much. "My dearest Elijah... I have a confession. I did not have that abortion." Daddy? "Her name is Keisha. I never told her about you because... I didn't want her to feel rejected like I feel. And I'm hoping you will give her the things that I couldn't..." I'm sorry, Gabrielle. So sorry. I made a terrible mistake. But I loved your mother with all my heart. I-I'm just trying to reconcile all of this with the man who raised me. The man who sings in the choir every Sunday. I can't believe you, daddy. Maybe we ought to... go look for her. I love you, daddy. Nothing will ever change that. I really don't think daddy's wrong for wanting to get to know Keisha. I mean, I'm such a daddy's girl, and I couldn't imagine anything worse than growing up without a dad. I mean, famine, war. -Morning sickness. -Oh, Regan, stop it. You know I'm here for you guys, whatever you decide. -You can't just walk away. -Well, what does your pop say? It looks like daddy has pretty much decided. And it looks like I'm taking my butt to Arkansas. No, you're not, I just had a conversation with Justus' people this morning, they do not like our strategy for his new Justus shoe collection. Oh, yes, I know, he wants something younger and fresher, or we're fired. I'm aware. Yeah, I need you to stay here, work on strategy, and I will go and deal with Keisha. You have a better relationship with Justus. Okay. Thank you, Regan. Mm. That's what friends are for. I will take my pregnant baby bump... Oh... ...all the way to Arkansas, because I love you. -Oh. -And I will deal with Keisha. And you are my best friend. Reporting live from my golf cart, darling, gas on my steak as I do always come to you from all over the world. I'm Veda Laurelton. And party, I got to give y'all the T on Justus Collins' latest video. Mm-hmm. She thinks she's cute. I'll show her cute. Mm. Oh, shit!

Never listen to what you gotta say. Keisha Jones? Libby, I'mma have Alisha finish pinning you up right here in this next chair. Okay. -Hi. I'm Regan Givens. -Hm. I'm here on behalf of my client. Mm-hmm. She might be your sister. She and your father would love to meet you. I don't have a sister, and I was always told I didn't have a father. Are you here to tell me different? Um... Your father's name is Elijah Wilson. Is there somewhere else we can talk? Somewhere more private? Yeah. Hm. You never wondered about your father? No, my mama was enough for me. I'm sure she was a lovely lady. But don't you wanna meet your daddy and sister? I gotta work. I got bills to pay. This is a lot to take in, I understand. Look, take your time. So Gabrielle isn't checking for me? I never mentioned that name. Sure you did. Whatever you decide, I will respect. Call me any time. -Look, I'll call you. -You do that. Now, if you want that type of speed, you need to change your RAM from DDR2 to DDR3. -Okay. -Okay. That means your ports are not compatible, sir, okay? But we can do upgrade, it's just gonna, you know, it's gonna cost you, and it ain't gonna be cheap. Guess who came up into the salon today? - Oh. Sorry, excuse me. - Who? -Regan. Gabrielle's BFF. -You... Uh, Afro man, come on, hit the door, B-dawg. Come on. You got no money. She came up in there like "Surprise, you got a family." Ooh, that's great, boo. That's great. Girl, they about to have their lives turned upside down. Gabrielle didn't even come to find me. I mean, she the one that got everything, my daddy. She got a daughter, too. Cute as hell. So, what's your plan now? I'm going to the A-T-L and I'mma take what's mine. You know, get a taste of that high life, their money, and anything else I can get my hands on. Okay. Well, you know, I got my boy Que on standby. And all we need is the bank information, and we got the rest. She ain't gonna know what hit her. Finally! So, what do you think? - What's she like? - I don't trust her. I spoke with the landlady at her old place, and she told me Keisha skipped out on four months' rent. Well, her mom just died. She's probably down on her luck. There's something else, the landlord said Keisha's been a little off ever since... -Since what? -She lost her baby. That would have been the same age as Bella. I can't even imagine. And do you think she's even gonna come? Oh, hold on. She's texting me right now. Like I said, she's in. We'll be there tomorrow. Let's talk details later. Thank you so much, Regan. You are amazing. Talk tomorrow. Princess Bella has requested that the queen of the house tuck her in tonight. Oh, did she? That's sweet. Well, that was Regan. Looks like we're gonna meet Keisha tomorrow. Okay. You sure about this? I've heard some pretty terrifying DNA tracing stories gone wrong. Yeah. It's what daddy wants. What do you want? For this to have never happened. But it looks like it's too late for that now. You know what I want? -Hm? -You know what I want. Oh, don't you start! But I wanna put our daughter to bed. You stop it! Leave me alone! Mm... You're not gonna answer that? -Hello? -Keisha, you on the plane yet? No. But I wish you were coming with me. Man, Regan is such a bitch. Look, don't worry about her, okay? Keep your little pretty eyes on the prize, and we'll be rolling in cash in no time. Yeah. I can't wait to get out there and do what I gotta do. Who's your little friend? Are you spying on me? Sounds like an interesting conversation y'all were having. No. It was my boss. I'm supposed to be working, remember? Mm-hmm. Ugh... Well, we should have met them at the airport. Daddy, we agreed it'd be best to let Regan bring Keisha here. I'm sure she'll be here any minute now. I-I-I just, I just want her to feel welcome. - And she will. - Oh! Hey, pops. -Hey. -How you been? Here she is! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Excuse me. -I need to go to the bathroom. -Yeah. Hi. I'm Gabrielle. -Hi. -Your sister. I can't believe I have a sister. Me neither. I'm so glad you're here. Well, looks like we have a lot of catching up to do. Yeah. Come on, let's, let's go inside. It was, it was great. Girl, I got to get this baby to bed. Here are the test documents. Documents? -Oh, yeah, the docu... -No. It's-it's nothing. -I'll see you later. -All right. Have a good night. You get some sleep. Uh, goodnight. - What documents? - Oh, it's nothing, daddy. Look, I don't wanna cause no trouble. No, no, it's, it's-it's-it's all right. Well, um, we're glad you're here. What's going on, Gabrielle? Daddy, can we please just talk about this later? I don't want there to be anymore secrets between us. Come on. Paternity test? I'm being cautious. Ever since my mama died... it's been really lonely. And I'm just happy I have people now. Look, I'll do whatever y'all want me to do. No, it's-it's-it's all right, sweetheart. Thank you. Thank you. I don't need a paternity test to know that Keisha is my daughter. Daddy, it's a necessary precaution. You said it yourself, I chose not to believe Daisy all those years ago, I'm not gonna make the same mistake again. I thought you were onboard with me on... I'm here, aren't I? Look, it's just, it's been a stressful night, all right? How about we all just get some sleep and start fresh in the morning? -I'll get your couch ready. -This my bed? I-I'm sorry, Keisha, I don't have a spare room. I've been trying to get daddy to move somewhere bigger. Well, I've been comfortable here for a long time. Wasn't no reason to change that... till now. I mean, this is the nicest thing I've ever had. Look, I'll tell you what, you-you take my room. -What? No, no, no, no. -Yeah. Daddy... Keisha, you can stay with me. No. It's fine, really. No, my place is bigger, and you'll have privacy. And it'll give us some time to get to know each other. Yeah, it would mean a lot to see my two girls get along. What do you say, Keisha? -Yeah. -Yeah! All right. I'll get my keys. I'll be right back. I'm just gonna check in with my husband. No, baby, you see, the problem is you made the decision without consulting me. Honey, I had to offer an olive branch. I mean, daddy was really upset. It doesn't make any sense. Of course, we're getting a paternity test. Yeah, but we hadn't discussed it with him yet. I mean, he was completely blindsided, and so was Keisha. How convenient. Ready to see your room? Yeah. -It's right up here? -Yes. Okay. They couldn't tell you forged the letter, right? Yo, I'm trippin' off these pictures, man. Look, she got it beyond that. You think it's bigger than Cousin Que's triple wide? This is on a whole other level. Ain't no storm coming and blowing this place down. Well, then show me. Do a video. No, I don't wanna look like I'm creeping around her house. - So they nice? - They cool. Elijah's all crying and stuff. He knows he did me dirty. Well, what about Gabrielle? I mean, I know how to play her. Look, I didn't come here for friends. Me and Daisy hustled my whole life. All right, I'll start looking for account numbers tomorrow. Bank, uh, transaction, routing numbers... Account number, account number... What is this? Will. "I appoint Gabrielle Flores executor sole heir?" -Hold on! Okay... -All right, yes. - That's it. - Not bad. Just like the Congo line we did last night, huh? Yeah! Everyone started laughing, too. Then we had a paint fight. Oh, I bet all the moms just loved that. Daddy did, too. -Really? -Yeah. That's right. Because daddy was the only man at the mother-daughter night. Honey, I'm sorry, but I promise I will be at the bake sale. Mm-hmm. We'll see about that. But it's all good, 'cause Bella and I had fun anyway, didn't we? Mm-hmm. We even won the dance competition, pops. You wanna show grandpa our moves? Come on... -Yeah, let me see a step... -Come on. Ready? And... And... And turn and turn and... That's a girl. Dip. Hey, Keisha, good morning. We didn't see you there. Hey, Keisha. What's the matter, hon? Okay, all right, come on. Keisha? -I'mma go see what she... -No, no, no, daddy. Just give her a minute. I'll go up in a second. All right. All right. Yeah, I'm fine. Look, let's just continue with our plan. It's all good, baby girl. Any line on the old man's dough? Yeah, I found Elijah's will. He's giving everything to Gabby, but I'mma change that. How you gonna do that, Keisha? All I need is for him to take a paternity test. Once we have legal proof that I'm his daughter, the rest is easy. Keep your eyes on the prize. I gotta go. Daddy wanted to come up, but I thought maybe you might wanna talk to your sister? Look, I know that seeing us all together down there probably made you think of your mom. I'm really sorry. Yeah. She was all the family I had. Hm, trust me, I get that. My mom passed away, too. Really? I didn't know. Well, when she died seven years ago, I felt like I could barely breathe. But day by day I cried less and less. And now I'm able to smile when I think of her. Someday you will, too. Keisha, if it helps, you're not alone anymore. You wanna come downstairs and have breakfast with your family? Yeah. Uh, your better half took the baby to ballet. Got it. I'm gonna make some tea. -Hey. -Hey. -You all right? -Yeah, I'm good. Good. I'm gonna fix you a plate. Okay. Ooh, this floor is cold. I-I'm gonna go upstairs and get some shoes. -All right. -Okay. ♪ Oh Lord ♪ Are you okay? You were sad yesterday. Are you gonna live with us now? Aunt Keisha's gonna be staying with us for as long as she wants. Can I bring her to school for show and tell? -What y'all do? -Well, Mauricio's an accountant. And Regan and I started our own PR agency. Did it, uh... Did it take a lot of money to start your company? Well, Regan's family made a generous investment to get us up and running. Y'all must be rolling in it. We do fine. And we've been really blessed to have a couple of big clients. -You ever heard of Big Justus? -The rapper? More like a thug. Well, I love Justus. And his sneakers are dope. I mean, it's like perfect old meets new-school. -But... -But what? It's the way he's selling them, it's just straight old-school. What do you mean? Okay, like, like his last shoes, they came out at all the big stores at the same time. But you build more hype when you surprise people. Have a, a scavenger hunt for hidden sneakers. Scavenger hunt. Uh, hide a dozen signed pairs with little hints on his social media for-for people to find. I mean, his-his PicaPost would be blowing up with those shoes, trust me. - Right, Bella? - Yeah. - All right. We're here. - Pound 'em. Yeah! Folks. All right. Look at these beautiful people. So does your mama fix your hair? Sometimes. But she's a very busy woman. Yeah, well, I'll twist you out sometime. You know, your mama's my sister, so that makes me your aunty. -Like Aunt Regan? -Better. I hope we can be friends sometime. Would you like that? -All right. -Bella, time for Sunday school. I can take her. Can she, please? Uh, look, kiddo, we're all going to grandpa's after church, so you'll be able to see her then, okay? Huh? She'll be okay. You don't have to. No, really, I'm happy to. Okay. It's right upstairs on the right. Good to see you, good to see you. Hey. Pastor, this is my, my daughter Keisha. Oh, Keisha, good to meet you. And, of course, you know this one right here. My friend right there. How you doin'? I like those shoes, too. Listen, uh, your family is a big part of this house. And I hope you feel at home here. -Okay? All right. -Mm-hmm. All right, I'll see y'all in. Good to meet you. -Yes. -Yes. Hey. You ready to go? Lord knows I love you, Gabrielle, but you know how I feel about it, and you went and did it anyhow. I'd never order a paternity test behind your back. So now I'm confused, why did the clinic call and say my results would be ready tomorrow? I have no idea! Wait a minute. Did you send in a sample? Yeah, but I thought Regan must have set it up. Well, it's not ideal, but it's done. All right, at least now we'll know for sure. For the last time, Gabrielle, Keisha is my child. I don't need a paternity test to tell me that. Fine, I understand. Hey. I'm sorry you had to hear all that. No. She's just trying to protect her family. You're family. You have a place here. Do I? I mean, I came from nowhere. Look, I understand if you feel like you don't owe me anything. Oh. Keisha, I'm your father. You need anything, I'm here for you. What is it? I'm just so ashamed... Ashamed? What? I made a lot of mistakes in my life. Evicted. I still owe my landlord money. Credit is a mess. I, I couldn't even afford to put Daisy in the ground. You tell me how much you need, I'm happy to help. Come on. Let's go get my checkbook. Come on, Lord is in the blessing business. Come on. I still haven't signed off on the completed version. Hey, Gabrielle? One second, honey! Yes, 8 a.m. sharp. Thanks. - Goodnight. - Gabrielle. Yes? Is it just me or does it seem like this whole thing is happening a little too fast? With Keisha? I don't know. I think she's fitting in nicely with the family. Yeah, I hear you, I just like to know who's in my home and around my daughter. Well, I think it's nice having her around. She's harmless. Yeah, she was asking a lot of baseless questions in the car about work, money, Justus. She's probably just star-struck. It's not her fault you're so touchy about him. So many roads, let's not go down that one. Well, daddy's happy and I know that he wants to make up for lost time, so... Right. Uh, I'm gonna go check on Bella... No, I will check on our daughter. So precious. My precious daughter. My baby girl. I'm glad you called. Come on, sit down. Keisha and I had a good long talk and she helped me understand where you were coming from. I'm sorry. But I'm glad you're both here. The paternity test results. "Keisha Jones is a 99.9% match." Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I told you, girl. I'm gonna take both my girls to the steakhouse. We gonna go out and celebrate a little bit. Okay. Great! Well, let's go. Yeah. ♪ What good does it do if we never say this? ♪ -Is everything good so far? -Hm. Everything's amazing. -Great, thank you. -Mm. - Wow, you look nice tonight. - Oh, she's beautiful. My two beautiful daughters. Keisha, I'm so glad Daisy's letter brought you into our lives. I don't mean to pressure you. I've been thinking... You think you might consider staying here in Atlanta? You want me to stay here with y'all? Why not? You're family. Uh, I-I got a job back home. Well, heck, you can get one here. Um, could we help with that? Um, well... Keisha could work for me. -For real? -Yeah. You're a bright young woman. I'm sure we'll find something. Mm, I-I got a good contact down at the car dealership. Thinking Keisha might like her own car. Y'all would just take me in just like that? -I-I don't know what to say. -Say you'll stay. I-I, I really don't, don't know what to say. Well, ever since I got Daisy's letter, I've been overwhelmed by guilt. After all this lost time, I just wanna make things right. I used to pray for... I used to pray for this. I believe God heard. Oh, look at my baby. What's up, baby? Que got us swimming in cash. I told you, we living big time, girl. No, we just getting started, okay? I got keys to Gabby's house, and I got a new job running things. What that mean? Means... that they want me. They wanna make things right. Just like that? Are you forgetting about everything you and your mama done been through? Huh? Look, you in too deep, baby. Now you're forgetting the plan. I'm not forgetting. It's just this is better. I'm finally living the life I'm supposed to live. Look, just do not get your hopes up too high with these folks, all right? If there's one thing Daisy taught me, it's to take care of myself. One more step, right here. -Where? Okay. Got it. -Okay, okay. Keep going. -Keep going. -What is it? Keep your eyes closed. Keep your eyes closed. -All right. -Okay, okay. - Oh, my God. - Hold on. -What is it? -Hold on. Okay. All right. -Stay right there. -Here? Okay. Okay? Keep your eyes closed. Okay. Open your eyes! No, no, no, that's my car! Over here! This is your car! What do you think? Wow... Surprise! It's great, isn't it? Yeah. -Thank you. -Oh, it's perfect for you. Daddy and I picked it out ourselves. We're so glad that you love it. Yeah, all right. Big day. We got to get going. Okay, but it's so cute, isn't it? Look at it. You're gonna look so good in it. Okay, so I have to stop by Diore to pick up an order and then we will swing by Spend Less for your new clothes. Oh, my... Y'all got a DJ? Yeah. You play Ping-Pong? No, but I-I-I guess I'll try. Oh, excuse me. -This is legit. -Thanks. Hey, Pamela, this is Keisha's first day. Do you wanna get her set up? She'll be with us for a while. I got a big presentation with Justus today. -Today? -Yeah. -Oh, my God. -Wish me luck. Okay. Good luck. Does everyone get one of those? Is everything okay? Uh, yeah, everything's fine. I don't trust her. Can we just focus on the meeting, please? Can we focus on not letting a stranger into our business? I understand how you feel. All right, Regan, like, just talk to me, please. -We need to get this right. -I understand that. We could lose one of our biggest clients. I know. But I do love your pitch, it's really good. Yeah, and most of them are Keisha's ideas. She should be in this meeting. I'm not gonna allow a stranger to come into our office. -Our company depends on this. -Yeah, but... I'm just trying to do the right thing. I-I, I know I may have just met her, but she's my sister, Regan. It just feels wrong. It's simple. We're sticking to my plan. When Justus gets here, Keisha's not gonna be in this office. The one, the only Justus Collins. Regan! Are you ready for this evening... The question is, oh, are you ready? -Oh, I stay ready. -Okay. -Okay. -Oh, my God. -Justus. -Go back, go back. Yeah, I thought this was supposed to be a fan-free zone. Um, Keisha, she's new. -Oh, okay. We good, Smokey. -Ah, it's cool. Um, you're gonna be so excited because I'm excited because we have a new strategy. - Heh-heh. Hey-hey! - Ah. Um, I need you to go get coffee. Well, what about the meeting? That's above your pay grade. He loves the lattes down the street. I'll text you the order. Thank you. Welcome. So it's a sneaker release and a scavenger hunt. Regan, I never got your text, so I did a little digging on Justus' social media to get the orders right. - Double shot, no foam. - Great job. Um, Keisha, I must have forgot to text you. I'm sorry. - Keisha, I'm-I'm s... - Two... Gabby, I know we go way back and I gave you the seed money to start your company, but I gotta be honest with you, I was starting to doubt you. But this? This is so fresh! I cannot wait! Great job. Great job. I cannot wait for the J. Collins scavenger hunt to begin. Well, in honesty, this pitch was based off something that Keisha told me in the car the other day. Really good ideas, Keisha. Oh. I hear you. Okay, well, look, hey, great job. Great job, yo. Thank you. Uh, I'm glad that you like it. Um, excuse me. I'm taking her business, her money and her family. She ain't gonna know what hit her. Hey, boo. We back on. Come on, babe! Come on, we got to do this for the Justus campaign. I get it. But shouldn't Keisha go instead? -She's a part of it now. -No, not for this. And Regan's already pissed about her joining the company. - Come on, let's go. - Okay. Oh, uh, Keisha, you know what I mean, right? Yeah, it's cool. Look, I'm happy to watch Bella. It's no problem. Great. -Save me. -Stop it. Come on, let's go. -Don't wait up. -Have fun. -Thanks. -Goodnight. Who are you wearing tonight, Ms. Wilson? Oh, me? Oh, Veda. Veda, hi! I'm Keisha. Nice to meet you. Yeah, let's take some pics. What are you doing? I mean... Um, hey. I'm sorry. It's just... Everything is just so hard. Hey. Uh... What's-what's going on? I've been trying to make Gabrielle happy, and nothing is working. I mean, she didn't even want me at the meeting with Justus. She sent me to go get coffee. And look, I know that-that he's giving money to the company an... -Wait, wait, what? -Yeah, he said "seed donor..." He gave them the money to start the company. Didn't you know? Well, I can't, I can't believe she didn't tell me that. -She's very protective of him. -Yeah, don't I know it? I mean, um... Hey, look, hey. It's not personal, okay? Don't let him get to you. I just don't wanna let Gabrielle down. I just wanted to feel better, that's why I put the dress on. Hey, I understand, okay? Just talk to her first next time, okay? Oh, please don't tell her. Look, I-I'm just trying to do everything perfect for her. Hey. Keep your chin up, okay? No one's perfect. Come on, up, up, up. You're doing just fine, all right? Come on, give me a hug. Babe, did you find the tickets? Uh, yeah, I'm comin' now. You, you okay? -Yeah. -All right. Take the dress off so you don't get in trouble, okay? Okay, we're all done. Bella, you get the first pick. Which cookie do you want? Mommy doesn't like me to have them. Where is Gabby? Cookie monster can have half a cookie. Where she's always at these days, pops, working. Cheers. Yeah. I made it! Mm! Whoa! What's goin' on here? -Mommy! Mommy! -Hi, honey. What's goin' on? What are you up to? Come, come. We made cookies for my bake sale. And-and you got to try them. They're amazing. -Oh, my God. Chef Bella, here. -Oh. All right, ready? Let's do a drum roll, Bella. Here you go, pops. Wow! -Mommy likes them. -And they're homemade. For the first time we won't get dirty looks from the mean moms. Yeah, I hope that it's okay, um... I just knew that you were working late and everything. Yeah. No, it's fine. I have to prep for the Justus meeting tomorrow. Oh, maybe you can sit in this time. Wait, you-you're coming to the bake sale tonight, right? Look, I can go with Mauricio and Bella. I-I love hanging out with you guys. And family is everything, right, Bella? There you go, there you go. You know what, Saturday, ice cream, on me. -I'm taking everyone. -Oh, yes, yes, yes! Uh, hey, Gabrielle? Stop making promises you can't keep, okay? Um, let's finish wrapping up these cookies, why don't we? Yeah! Mm-hmm. Yes, exceeded expectations. But I still have to give my final approval. Can you have it on my desk tomorrow by 9 a.m.? Yes. I'm gonna call you back. Okay, thanks, talk soon. -Oh, yes. -Cream with no sugar. - Oh, thank you. - No problem. -So how was the bake sale? -It was great. I mean, Bella had such a good time. I just had a hard time keeping those moms off Mauricio. I mean, those ladies... Whoo! -Uh, anyways, enjoy. Goodnight. -Goodnight. Oh, my God, I don't know what happened. I must've slept straight through my alarm. I-is Justus even still... -Justus is gone. -What? -How bad is it? -Not bad at all, actually. Little miss thing here did the presentation. What do you mean? What? Oh, yeah, I mean, you weren't answering your phone and Justus was ready to walk out of here. You've worked so hard on this, it didn't feel right to let you lose the account. I mean, how did you, how did you even... You know what, um, thank you... for having my back. Yeah, of course. I got your back same as you got mine. You still upset? It just bugs me that Keisha was so ready to take my place. Sounds like she saved the day, to me. Yeah, well-well, Regan thinks she's up to something. Mm. Keisha thinks the world of you, Gabby. Oh, really? Since when are you so pro-Keisha? Well, look, I wasn't gonna say anything, but the other day I found her in your closet, trying on your clothes. -What? -Don't make a big deal. About this. It is a big deal. She has no business touching my things. She was trying to fit in. She wants to make an impression on her big sister. I think you may be holding her back just a little bit. You know what, a couple of good ideas does not make her an expert. Keisha's got a lot to learn. Hm. By being Justus' coffee girl? -Noted. -Here we go. I'm sorry, it is just obnoxiously clear that you put him above everything and everyone else. That is not true. He is our biggest client. -And he's also your ex. -Oh. You really need to get over that. It was years ago. You want me to get over it? All right, so, so why didn't you tell me that he financed your business? You told me that Regan's pops gave you the cash to start the business. Why, why would you lie to me? This isn't even supposed to be about Justus, okay? It's about Keisha. My bad. You are absolutely right. You screwed up, Keisha cleaned up. So why don't you drop the conspiracy theories, and, I don't know, show a little gratitude? What's, what's going on? -Oh, my God, is that Justus? -Yeah. Just a little celebratory brunch to welcome you to the agency. Hey-hey! You are something special. I should have known you two were sisters here. -Wow. -We are so, so proud of you. Come here. - Thank you. - Thank you. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Appreciate it. So you two known each other for a while? - Oh. - Forever. So I asked Gabby to marry me when I was 13 for the first time and then I asked her about, ooh, 15,000 times after that, and every single time she said no. -You were never serious. -What are you talking about? I was crazy about you. I got to get to choir practice. I'll see y'all at church tomorrow. We're having lunch after, right? -Of course. -Okay. -Good to see you, pops. -You, too. - Bye, daddy. - Buh-bye. -Okay to talk shop? Great. -Yup. So look, I was thinking about the sneaker launch next week... -Next week? -Oh. I guess you weren't CC'ed on the, that email yesterday. Um, the J. Collins have been getting so much attention on PicaPost, Justus wants to drop them sooner. So we're gonna do the release next week instead of next month. PicaPost is gonna sponsor the event. That's great. I mean, I just wish that we would have talked about this before Keisha ran with it. Now, Gabby, look, you know you are the smartest woman I know. You're my ride or die, all right? But I do believe that Keisha should take point on this campaign. -For real? -For real. Oh, my God! -No way! Okay! -Yes. I mean, Gabby, only if you're cool with it. Yeah, uh, you've shown real initiative. Of course it's fine. -Awesome. -So what's your plan? Well, a premiere party with a pop-up store. I mean, his social media is already blowing up. And get this, we invite Veda Laurelton. -Ooh. -Well, who's Veda Laurelton? Well, she's the new social-media gossip queen. Oh, okay. -Cheers. -Cheers. Oh. Well, I think that went well. There appears to be a significant amount of money missing from our accounts. What? What do you mean? How much? Uh, well, they are pretty good at what they do because they didn't take a ton at once. Roughly $500 daily for a few weeks, give or take. Do they know who did it? No. Right now it's under investigation. But I needed to close our accounts. Depending on what they find, hopefully we get our money back. Yeah, I mean, I hope so, too. That's really horrible. -Hi. -Oh, sorry. On a lighter note, how was brunch? Oh, it was good. Justus is so talented, and, oh, my God, so fine. Wait, what? You were with Justus? Keisha. Keisha, uh, can you give us a moment, please? -Sure. -Mm. So let me get this straight. It's not enough that you have to work with him during the week? No. You have to have brunch with him on the weekends as well. I don't get it. At what point are Bella and I a priority in this equation? Baby, you know that you and Bella are my world. You just say that, but your actions don't match. You see, there are plenty of times that I know firsthand where this family comes behind your career. This isn't even about my career. It's about Justus. Oh, yeah, I can't put anything past you, can I? Look, right now I need you to be honest with me. Did you hook up with Justus when we broke up six years ago? How many times are you gonna ask me this? You're not answering the question. Because we've been over it. Well, then how about we go over it again? I just found out that he gave you money to start your business, you had plenty of time to tell me about that. Did you hook up with Justus or not? You know, it'd absolutely disgrace me to think that there is a possibility that Bella isn't even mine. Don't you ever say that to me again. Daddy? Daddy, can I have some milk? Sure, baby. Of course. Ahem. -Um... -And I'll get some milk. Get you some milk and some cookies 'cause mommy's gonna get you cookies. How about that? You with it? - Mm-hmm. - Cool, cool, cool. All right now, let's give it up for the praise team. Come on, somebody! - Amen. - Don't they sound good? All right. Everybody can have a seat real quick. Yeah, I know the day has been long, but it's been a wonderful Sunday. I'm not gonna keep you much longer 'cause I know you wanna get out into the world on this Sunday afternoon and have a good time doin' what people do on Sunday. Today I have a word for somebody. - Amen! - Amen! Reading from Philippians verse two, chapter three. "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility, value others above yourself." Ambition is what we do to promote ourselves. But when our ambition becomes your primary agenda... - Come on now, pastor. - Uh-huh. Come on now. We will compromise our values to, what, to attain any kind of success. And that's a dangerous thing to do right now w-when you, when you have so much ambition that you will compromise your values, your morals, just to attain success. - Mm-hmm. - Amen, somebody. Come on, somebody. Come on, somebody! Come on, somebody. Y'all get me. Aunt Keisha! -Hey, do you need me? -Hey, Veda! The marketing genius herself! Hey! Now what's this T you gotta tell me, girl? Okay. - Hello. - Oh, oh, uh... Is it true, the CEO of your marketing agency, Gabrielle Flores, is also your baby mama? And that's her right there, isn't it? What are you talking? What? Are you helping take care of your daughter? How do you live with yourself? Mrs. Wilson-Flores. Is that your official statement? You need to get the hell out of here right now. So are you denying that the two of you were ever involved? Justus, is it true that Gabby is the one that got away? A gentleman never tells. -Hey, what'd you say? -You heard what I said. Oh, yes. Whoa! Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Get off! -What are you doing? -Let me go! Regan's taking Keisha and Bella home. Let me see that. It's fine, it's fine. It's fine. It's okay. You know I put up with a lot, Gabrielle, but it absolutely kills me that you were ever with that dude. We were broken up, and I was upset. And you thought it was a good idea to run to Justus when we broke up? That's what caused all of this! Forget Justus, okay? I'm your wife! Listen to me! I'm yours! I'm yours! -Only yours. -Prove it. Prove it. Just stop representing Justus. We've been through this. Without him, I do not have a business. You'll survive. You'll survive! Our agency is all about image. Like, how would it look if I dropped my biggest client? Gabrielle, it's him or me. I won't choose. What are you doing? Making it easy for you. I'll stop by the house later to pick up my things. -Wait, come on, Mauricio, plea... -I'm done talking! We're done. Look, I just, I need to take a walk. Take the car whenever you're done here. Oh, man. Keisha, how much of that did you hear? I wasn't snooping. Yeah, we weren't exactly being discreet. Are you really gonna leave Gabrielle? Keisha, no. Look, just, um, find Regan and take Bella home. I need to clear my head. You crossed the line. I'm good here. Me? Your husband almost tanked my event. -I should sue his ass. -You provoked him. And now, your little act... it may have cost me my marriage. Gabby, I'm sorry. Listen, I would never do anything to hurt you. Look at me, the only reason why the Bella stuff came up is because Keisha asked me about it, that's it. -She convinced me. -What? She made me think that Bella could be mine. What do you mean? It's been in my head ever since. I'm sorry. Hey, Mauricio, I know that you're mad, but can you please just call me back? We really need to talk. All right. I love you. Hey! Who told you about Bella? Mommy? No, baby, she's busy. She's always busy. Yeah. But I'm here for you. And, Bella, you know I love you very much, right? I love you, too, Aunty Keisha. If you want, you can call me mommy. Or Mama Keisha. Okay? Let's get you back to bed, okay? Hello! You were right about her all along. Who? Keisha? Veda's been getting all of her info from Keisha. And after talking to Justus, I think she's been trying to destroy my family since the day she walked into my house. What... That devil! What? Why would she do that? Envy. She wants to be you. Regan, where is my daughter? O-oh, my God. I-I left her alone with Keisha. I'm heading back. In light of the recent events... at the J... Ah. Uh... In light of the recent conflict at the J. Collins event... Yeah. I will be transferring all my clients to Keisha. Hurry up! Open this door! -You forget something? -Where's Bella? Why? Get out of my way, Keisha. You need to check your lane. I watch Bella. Not anymore. I knew your ass was up to no good. What are you talking about? You're talking crazy. No, what's crazy is you over here spreading vicious paternity rumors about Bella! But you've got no proof. Oh, but Gabrielle does. And now she sees you for who you truly are. Look, Veda is a liar. You can't trust anything she says. Oh, so I suppose that Justus is a liar, too, huh? Look, it's a misunderstanding. Gabrielle's about to throw you out on your broke, lying ass, and I can't wait because I'm gonna enjoy every moment of it. Now get out! Get out of my way! No! No... - Is that you, mama? - Uh... Yes, it's me, baby. Come on. -I'm scared. -Let's just... -Watch your step. -Why are you yelling? Come on, it's okay. Just watch your step. I got you. 911, what's the nature of your emergency? The address is 5555, Wilson Place. -Please hurry, she's pregnant. -Yes, ma'am. Emergency personnel on their way. ♪ Jesus save me from sin ♪ ♪ 'Cause I need your help ♪ Elijah. Look, text me your location. -Are you near the house? -Yeah. Meet me around the corner from Gab's house. On the corner of Olivia and 1st Street. Oh, thank God. You have to get Bella home. Elijah, I can't do it. I can't face them. Keisha, we are family. Please don't call me Elijah. Let me be your father. What the hell does that mean? Fathers are there for their children in their sins and in their graces. I'm here. You're not alone. Let's face this together... as father and daughter. Your friend's vitals are stable, and we think her baby will be okay. -But we got to get going. -Okay, thank you. Her name is Bella Flores. Okay? She's six years old. She's about three-and-a-half feet tall. This is the picture that we took of her tonight and that's the young lady that took her tonight. -Oh, my God, Bella! -Bella! - Oh, my God. - My God. -Gabby, I'm so sorry. -Don't! You took my child. How could you? Keisha Jones? I'm sorry. Is Regan okay? I will never forgive you. I will never forgive you. - I'm sorry. - Stop it. It's-it's-it's gonna be all right. I'm coming... - I'm coming down there. - Get out of here! How could you? L-let me, let me... I know, sweetheart, but Jesus and granddad are looking after you. It's-it's okay, baby. It's all right. Come on. Gabrielle, we're gonna be all right. I can't imagine my life without you, without Bella. I know who I married. I wanna fix us, I wanna fix this. I wanna fix us, too, and I promise that I'm gonna do better with work, with, with everything, with our family... -Hey, hey, hey. -I won't, I... I love you. Nothing will ever change that. I love you, too. I love you so much. We're all she has. And, daddy, I understand why you have to do this. You're Keisha's father. But I have to draw the line somewhere. -And she took Bella. -I... I will walk in to support you. Please don't ask more of me. Keisha? Keisha? - Keisha? - Hey, sir. -Please move away from the door. -My name is Elijah Wilson. I'm-I'm here to see my daughter. Gonna need some help in here. Uh, sir? Sir, this is not where we usually hold the inmates. Toda... Listen, you need to use that little walkie-talkie thing to call your boss. I will see my daughter. If it helps, you're not alone anymore. You're family. You have a place here. I used to pray for, I used to pray for this. I already told the lawyer I'm staying. You can't change my mind. Why do you keep punishing yourself? You made mistakes, but you deserve forgiveness. All the terrible things I've done to you... When I came into your lives, it was all based on a lie. Everything you feel for me is based on a lie. Daisy brought you into our lives. -It was the last thing she did. -No. That letter from Daisy... I wrote it and I sent it. -She told you? -No. I found you myself. I sent it because I wanted what I thought y'all owed me. But-but, Keisha... Daisy did write the letter. Someone from the hospital sent the Bible with the letter in it. You wrote a new letter and you sent it. But... what Daisy wanted was real. The letter is real. God doesn't love us 'cause we're perfect. He loves us even though we're not. He's forgiven me... for abandoning you. And He's forgiven you for what you've done. As much pain you've caused me, I can see that you're in pain, too. We need to heal together as a family. Oh, my child, there's always hope. I'm sorry. Gabrielle, I'm so sorry. I know. You're my sister. Come on, let's, let's pray. Our Father, who art in Heaven... hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done... on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day...
