We're all set. You sure you know what you're doing? Yes of course. The museum closes soon, in one hour, I'll be in and out. You'll get what you want. The security system is taken care of. I'll meet you in the warehouse. Look out for my money. You'll get your money. - Good. - So get out of here. Beautiful. Oh, thank you. Haven't had this much hands-on attention since I was in diapers. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. After you. O'Brian, Judd Ross. - Judd, how was your flight. - Terrific. It was a perfect excuse to sit under the headphones, drink some good wine and stare at beautiful women. So is my bodyguard with you? Like Velcro, not exactly the talkative type, huh? He's not paid by the word, all I'm doing is protecting my investment in you, pal. This deal is worth so much money. You're damn right, it's the biggest startup this country's seen since the Bolshevik Revolution. So when's Janie coming? She's not. That's one of the reasons I'm here, my man. Now I wanna shake off the dust, get a little excitement back in my life. Speaking of which, what time for cocktails so we can talk business? What do you say, about seven o'clock, we'll walk through the plan, make sure it's foolproof? - You got it. - Alright I'll see you then. All ready to go? Why don't you take the next couple of hours off? I'm gonna see some sites. Alone. The warehouse isn't that way! No! Hey man, are you alright? What are you doing? Look, you just came out of the blue, I didn't see you. - Go! - What? Go, right now. Run! Red Audi, license E345, my hunch is registered, call me back. Yeah. Oh, what the hell is this all about? - I'm in big trouble. - Yeah no kidding, I got that much. Look, put that thing away, just put it away! Who was that guy? A pimp, he's after me. A pimp! They sell girls to tourists, of course not you. Alright, which way to the nearest police station then? - No police, no no no! - Yeah but can't they? No no, this is not America, no police. - Well where am I going? - Just drive, keep driving straight. Alright, alright. - Look, I'm Judd Ross. - Sasha. Sasha, yeah. Listen up, Sasha. You know, I'm a lawyer, maybe I can help you with this. I do not want your help. - Well what about your pimp? - What pimp? That guy, you said he was a? Ah, I'm not that kind of girl. - Well I didn't mean to imply. - Slow down, slow down. Alright, alright, alright. Look Sasha, Sasha, listen to me, listen to me, I just think that if you're in trouble, there ought to be someplace safe where you can. What? Poor baby, you know nothing. No one in Russia is safe. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee. I have no time for coffee, there is someone I have to see here. Goodbye, Judd Ross. I've just come from the hermitage. One of Katherine the Second's tiara was stolen. - The tiara is missing? - Just before closing. Thief escaped on a motorcycle. Come to my desk. Any leads? Somebody on a BMW wearing black leather. This will be impossible to keep quiet. Especially if the tiara is already out of the country. Although, it will be difficult to move this quickly. More likely, it will stay in the underground until it is safe to move. Perhaps a wealthy foreigner. It wouldn't be the first time that the foreigners paid thieves to steal our artifacts. Priceless artifacts. What do you intend to do? I will keep you posted on any developments. Please do. Who hired you? Andrew O'Brian. To guard his friend. What? Why is he here? Lots of money, foolproof plan. Now come on, come on! Is this where he went? I don't know. Hello? Some bodyguard. Bond, Judd Bond. Jeez. Where's the phone? Come on, come on, come on come on come on. Yes, Mr. Ross? Yeah yeah, I'd like to make a phone call, please. Alright. Thank you. Yeah, Andrew O'Brian, please, it's urgent. Yeah, well you get him out of the meeting, this can't wait, do you understand? Alright, thank you. We need to meet immediately. Come on, Nicky, while you can still talk. No devil cross, I will do that, I kept my word, we had a deal. There there, you wanted to have a holiday at the Black Sea. How does the bottom of the Neva River sound instead? I don't know what went wrong, I swear to you! I'll cut your body into bite-sized pieces. Who stole the tiara? I don't know, really. I was ready to go into the hermitage, I didn't even know what happened until Pavrick told me. So it was someone dressed in your clothes riding one of your motorcycles? Maybe it was Matisse. Like Pavrick loses control. - Should I kill him? - Keep him alive. He may lead us in the right direction. Come on, come on! I need to see Andrew. Andrew O'Brian, is he in? Is he in? You're sure, okay thank you. Andrew. Oh good god, listen man. Andrew? Hey. Come on, Andrew, are you? Oh god. Oh my god. I didn't do this, I didn't do this. Please, shh shh shh. I didn't do this! Hey, I didn't do it! Sasha! Sasha! I'll be right back. Sasha! Sasha, hold on, I need to see you. You owe me some answers. Is everything alright? Yes Papa. I owe you nothing. Well I think you do. Like why one hour after meeting you running away from some trouble, my bodyguard and my business partner are both dead. - Dead? - Yes, he was definitely dead! I am telling you, no police, it would be crazy. Crazy? Crazy is the only two people I know in this city both dead. Which leads me to believe a similar fate in store for me if I don't figure out what's going on. Were you seen by anyone? Oh yeah, and screaming bloody murder too. This is not America, do not go to the police. You will be arrested, you will be imprisoned, you will not get a fair trial, provided that you are innocent, of course. Of course I'm innocent. Do I look like a killer to you? Maybe your friend, he was mixed up with mafia. What? Mafia. Mafia, I have known Andrew since we were both at Harvard together. Harvard, that is a very good university. Nevermind about Harvard, this is about you. And whatever it is you are mixed up in. It is not safe to tell you. Not safe? How can I be anymore unsafe? The only thing I can be more of here is dead. Come with me. Whoever's after you has undoubtedly traced the plates and knows this car is leased to me, hence the dead people in my wake. - Jude. - It's Judd. Judd. I'm sorry about your friend. This will not be reported. What do you mean? The government is afraid to scare off American investors. Somebody will take the bodies and make it look like a terrible car accident. No one will ever know the truth. Yeah, but what about Andrew's secretary? I mean, she saw me standing over his dead body. They will give her a nice new apartment, a new car, she saw nothing, she knows nothing. I can't believe this country. You Americans, you think Russia's so easy. No. What do you know about Americans? I know what your great country brings us. Coca Cola, Big Macs, Jack in his box. The box. Jack In the Box. Look, America may not have all the answers but a couple of bucks tossed at this economy wouldn't be such a horrible thing, you know. If the dollars made it to the economy, but the dollars, they make it into the pockets of big shots who make deals. Another piece of Russia gone, nothing for her people. - Over here. - What? - Slow down. - Alright, alright. So where are we? Just follow me. Are you afraid I will run away? You're not going anywhere if you know what's good for you. Is this how you treat your girlfriend? Who said I had one? Nicky. - Nicky. - Sasha? - No. - Sasha? I'm so sorry. Pavrick is with us. I said come along. Wait in the car. I lost a very valuable tiara. It seems an American is involved. We're dealing with it. Judd Ross? - You know? - So do you. Is that why his partner is dead? Better not be traced back to you. You worry too much. Inspector Ladimia had the keys. Well he can't put the murder on me. I'm talking about the tiara. Ladimia is a tired old man. Do not underestimate him. He might put you in prison again. We'll see. Sasha, who is this? Judd, he's a friend, he's trying to help me. Nicky, somebody hurt you bad. Is it the same person who hired you for the job? What job? Hey, what are you talking about? - They will not. - Will not what? - Find you. - Who won't find you? - Sash. - Nicky. Who are you talking about? - We must go. - Who are they? Nicky's friends, they're no good, trouble always finds them. Oh, like it hasn't found us? Come on. This way. Okay, let's go. Wait, Sasha, you have got to tell me everything that you know. Now what job were you and Nicky talking about, huh? Sasha. Turn around and listen to me. What the hell is this? Your watch, I borrowed it. You mean you stole it. I'm good, huh? You didn't even notice. Here, take it back. I think it may be too masculine for me after all. I don't believe this. Nothing in this country is what it seems. That is what makes it so interesting. You know, Sasha, I have a life in America, I'd like to make it back home to that. And your girlfriend? Now that's a whole new topic. Ha ha, I knew you had a girlfriend. I'm glad you think this is so funny. I am in a strange country, I'm in a hell of a lot of trouble, can't go to the police. And the only one that can help me is some irresponsible... I am not irresponsible. I work hard, I've made something for myself. Oh yeah, you call getting mixed up with murderers making something for yourself. You do not know what I have done or why I have done it. Well now you're getting the picture, lady. If I knew a little bit more about what's going on here, maybe I could help. You are so naive, you cannot even help yourself. How do you expect to help me? Well this can't be a completely lawless country, I mean, there has to be someone who can help us. Isn't there one person in this whole city you can trust? One. I would like you to meet Judd. Judd Ross. I was about to eat, will you join me? Sure, yeah. My Sasha. Very good coffee. Yes, very good. Sasha spent many hours at the hermitage with me as a little girl. It fed her love of art. I had the privilege of being a guard for over 50 years. Starting when he was just 18 years old. The Nazis, the Nazis think they can destroy Russian treasure, 900 days we lived at the museum. This is why Papa said we won the great patriotic war. They underestimated Russian dedication. After each bombing, we dug out the living, bandaged the wounded, buried the dead. All the while packing every treasure, over three million pieces they sent by train into the Euro mountains for safekeeping. After the war, not one, not one piece was missing until now. But why now? Sasha, my paper. Catherine the Great's tiara, stolen from the hermitage. This is a great tragedy. A great tragedy. So what does it say right there? I do not believe what I see! That's what they're after. There was a plan to steal it, and Nicky wasn't... Nicky will come to no good end, I told you. I know, Papa, but I couldn't think straight. You're not kidding. When you jumped into my car, you'd just stolen it? That means they think I'm in on it with you. It was an accident, you saw it for yourself. Accident? Oh well that is terrific, everybody around me is dead because of your little accident. Dead? People are dead? Sasha, what did you plan to do with the tiara? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know, you're hiding a priceless piece of stolen jewelry in your backpack and you don't know? Nicky was to steal it for somebody but he wouldn't tell me who, I couldn't let that happen, Papa. I knew that if I did not take the tiara, it would be gone from Russia forever. But how? How did you manage to steal it? From my work at the hermitage, Sasha knows all about the security. Papa, you and so many others worked so hard to save our treasures. But nevertheless, it's still an illegal act, you've broken the law. If the truth were known about what I did, I would be a Russian hero! Our fakes were more real than this. What fakes? The director of the hermitage was worried the war might never end. He commissioned the finest jewelers in Russia to copy the most famous works, maybe 50 pieces total. And where are these fakes? Hermitage basement, long forgotten. How many people know about them? Everyone was sworn to secrecy. Probably most are dead by now. I know who I must call, someone I've known for years. No police! He loves art as much as I do! What do you plan to do, Papa? Hand him the tiara and say, here I was out for a walk and look what I found? Sasha, we need to find a solution or you're going to go to jail. I am not staying for this. What the? Sasha! I'll fix it. Sasha. Listen to me, we can fix this. No we can't fix this. We cannot fix it, I was wrong to get you involved, I am so sorry. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Shh shh shh. Go ahead. How can I help you, inspector? I think you know. More cat and mouse games? I am better at that than you. - Perhaps I've improved. - Six months in prison? Why not? Still the comedian, I see. You heard about the hermitage robbery. - And? - And what? I just run a small night club. And a few other operations as well. Enough to get the diamond tiara out of Russia. - Prove it. - Perhaps I will. People are dead and it is my fault. No, no no no, it's not your fault. Whoever plans this robbery bears the responsibility. It's easy for you, a lawyer, to feel like that. But I know it is my fault. Sasha, listen. I understand your motivation to wanna save your country's artifacts, I even find it admirable. You do? I never thought I'd think that, but yeah, I think what you did was admirable. - What are you going to do? - Lose 'em. Okay, try. To the end of the street, make a right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's move! Go go go! What the hell are you doing? Look, we need a new car. Why do I get the feeling you've done this before? Because I have. Besides, this was necessary. Oh yeah? Well what about my watch, was that necessary too? Of course not, that was just for fun. So, what do you think of Russia so far? Being on the run for an art heist. I feel positively invigorated. Let's get out of here. Thank you for coming, old friend. Since you've retired, I've missed our conversations. Were you surprised to hear from me? It has been a very long time. Little Sasha? Not so little anymore. She works as a model to support her art studies. Now she teaches classes herself. Let's have a drink. I do not arrange her dates. - So? - So. You have heard. Everyone in St. Petersburg, the city weeps as one. You called me for something. I want to know, who would be so bold as to steal a million-dollar tiara? Two million. That's right. As to who took it, we don't know yet. Is there something you need to tell me? No no. Just an old Russian heartsick at the thought of losing a piece of our history forever. Yeah, it's me. The police have found the American's car. - And the American? - Gone. - But he's with a girl. - Who? - We don't know yet. - Does she have our tiara? When we find her, we'll know. Check Drovsky Street, that's where we last saw her. Okay. So where are we now? I'm not sure what to think about you. You say you stole this tiara as a historical gesture. I get the feeling you also did it for the thrill. What is life without a few thrills? Thank you. And what do you do for thrills? For thrills? Let's see, okay, when I was a kid, I backpacked all the way across Europe. That does not sound very dangerous. Does not, huh? Alright. Okay, you want thrills? I'll give you thrills. I ran with the bulls at Pamplona. - Not bad. - Yeah, see? Just once. Yes. And then I got married, then I got divorced and then, now I work. - Poor baby. - Yeah. - Hello. - Hi. Wait a minute. - Careful! - Sorry! This luggage cost me a fortune. Mr. Ross's room, please. I'm sorry, but Mr. Ross is not in right now. Oh, well that's fine, just give me the key to his room. I'm here to surprise him anyway. I'm sorry but I cannot do that. I'm his girlfriend. There is no mention of your arrival, ma'am. Well there wouldn't be, would there? It's a surprise. He doesn't know I'm coming. I'm sorry but Mr. Ross is registered as a single. This should take care of your crisis of conscience. Right? Oh yes. Three-one-nine. - Happy? - Oh yes. Sasha, you never mention your mother. Russia is my mother. Papa found me in an orphanage when I was 10 days old. I looked into his eyes and from that day on, I'm his daughter. But your real parents? My real father, his name was not on the birth papers. And my mother, she died giving birth to me. Now I understand why the tiara has such a special place in your heart. Not just the tiara, everything Russian. They will undoubtedly pull each jewel out of the tiara and destroy our history. To them, the value is about the jewels, not the tiara. Each ruby, the blood of Russian soldiers. Each sapphire, the color of Russian skies. Each diamond, the tears shed by our mothers, daughters, sisters. All of that lost? I could not let that happen. We need to talk to Nicky again. He's the only one who can help us put this puzzle together. I know where to find him. Oh no no no, no. Put it there. Oh, mess. Typical. Nicky. Who is this? You met him yesterday, he's a friend. Everybody is Sasha's friend. So who beat you up? Sasha knows who beat me up. I don't, that is what I'm trying to find out. You know very well why I couldn't tell you. Could it be if we're talking about? It is the only person I trusted and told about the ruble. I'm sorry. Yes, you should be sorry, Sasha. I was going to use the money for us, for a vacation, relaxing. There is no us, Nicky. Not for a long time. I should tell who stole the tiara and still get my money as a reward. You don't know what you are into here. Look pal, you have no proof that she stole that tiara. If you were smart, go home now. Otherwise, you might not make it. Nicky. I need the motorcycle. Why? Am I never ever to say no to Sasha? I'll bring it back, I promise. Sure, try to make it in one piece, okay? Nicky, you are sure they do not know about me? You wouldn't be alive if they knew. Sasha. Don't go near the Black Cat. The night club, why? You heard me. Where are we going? Dre. See? There is a Mercedes. Yeah. Nicky was right about the Black Cat. This could get dangerous. It's our only lead. Okay, let's go. I just wanna order a drink. Okay. Room service? Can you send a bottle of Dom Perignon? Dom, oh for. Yeah, just a minute. Champagne Skaya? Yeah it's me. Listen Pavrick, do not come back until Nicky tells you who the girl is, you understand? And what if he does not? Kill that little piece of shit. Can you give me a lift home? There's Nicky and his friends. Yeah. - Yeah, that's very funny. - I'm in pain, I have to go home. He's after Nicky, go! Don't worry, you just hang on! Where the hell is he? Oh, this is your last chance. I don't know what you're talking about. You do, Nicky. This is the girl I'm looking for. What's her name? Put it down. She's a very sexy girl. Put it down! And she looks like a good motorcycle rider. Who is she? Nobody. The same nobody who helped you to steal our diamond tiara. Sasha had nothing to do with it. - Sasha? - Yes. Sasha? Sasha, Sasha who? My own babushka hits me harder than that. It's your last chance to save yourself. Who is Sasha? Bye, Nicky. No no, no no, no no! No! Let me go! Nicky! - Sasha. - Yes. I loved you. Nicky. Who was behind this? Artium, Artium is behind it. No. Here we go. Listen Sasha, who is this, this Artium? Everybody in St. Petersburg fears him. Yes I know that, but who is he? A criminal. Very powerful. He can arrange anything. Nicky's dead. I'm not surprised, but I am sorry. Come here. I have something you will find very interesting. Papa, you went to the hermitage. When I tell you about the fake, I see that you are thinking. You bet I was. Look at this. Man. They are impossible to tell apart. It's a very good thing, da? Oh, da, very good thing. Now I think I know what to do, and if this works, we all walk away. You know, this could be dangerous. I know, I don't have any other choice. I need my papers and my passport. Listen, maybe you ought to wait here. I don't think so. Yeah, it's me. No no no, not that way, not that way. Come here. You son of a bitch! Jane, what are you doing here? I came to surprise you. Certainly seems I've been successful. You gave me a ring, you shit! Stupid airplane food, my fingers are swollen like sausages. I thought we were a couple. Well we were, but that's not an engagement ring. I mean, come on, things have been lousy between us for a long time. Consider this ring thrown in your face, you loser. Janie, come on, don't be so upset. Upset? I should be cool and calm when you tumble into the room locked in a passionate embrace with some two-bit Russian hooker? - I am not a hooker! - That's enough! Is it? Are you sure you don't need to be tested for every disease known to man? You can have your horrible girlfriend. Wait wait, Sasha! Janie, look. I am sorry, I am. But we were over, we both knew it, we just hadn't faced it yet. Sasha! Sasha wait, I can expl... Wow. Hello. Wait, she's totally innocent. She doesn't look so innocent to me. Judd, what on earth is going on? The bullet will go through both of you. Stay put. - My father is a wealthy man. - Not now, Jane. Looks like I have everybody I need. Beautiful company. Let's go. - Where are we going? - Wait wait wait wait, just leave her here, she has nothing to do with this! She does now, come on. Wait wait wait, Judd, ladies first. Son of a bitch. I knew it. - My tiara? - Soon. Tell me please, why are the Japanese yakuza so interested in getting their hands on it? You know, of course, and that's why I want my share of the money now. When I get the tiara. I read the tiara is now worth at least $2 million. Our deal remains, as before. Then, my friend, we have no deal. Wait. Hey, come on, guys. Move. It's okay, Jane. What are you gonna do with us? That's for Judd to decide. Kill you, I think! As soon as the tiara is found. I think he told you about the tiara and you decide what to do. Sit down. We don't have the tiara, we don't know a damn thing about it. Nicky didn't talk to protect you. That's very sweet, and also very dumb and you, you drive away with it after the robbery, I saw you! Come on, she's hyperventilating. - Get her some water! - Get her some help. Sasha no! Put the knife away. - But he killed Nicky! - Put the knife away, now! Alright, get up, get up! Come on girls, let's get out of here. Out the door, go on. You too, pal. Come on, get out there. Nice work, Janie. Piss off, Judd. Judd. Is this Artium? - What a lovely surprise. - Go. So you're the guy we have to make a deal with. A deal? Now why would I want to do that? Because we have your tiara. - You can't fence it. - No, and we don't want to. We just wanna get out of here and get on with our lives. - Very smart. - Yeah. And your proposal? Same deal you had with Nicky. Whatever he was getting, you pay us and we give you the tiara. We'll meet at the warehouse. Pavrick knows the way. No, no no, I'm more comfortable with a lot of people around. Sports arena. Sports arena, five o'clock, you bring the money, we bring the tiara. Now, perhaps you'd be so kind as to release Pavrick? Yeah, sure. In return for the car. Stop the car, stop the car! - Alright, alright. - Stop the car! Let me out. Janie. You won't even know where you are! I know exactly where I am with you. Jane, Jane! You don't have a passport, I can't let you out in the middle... What does this look like to you? Alright. Don't go back to the hotel, alright? I don't intend to, you mega loser! - Papa? - Papa isn't here. Papa's police friend. Where is Papa? In the country. You think you cannot trust me, but your Papa and I, we are friends. Right now, it's not safe for him here. Papa would not leave me here. I gave him no choice. I have many enemies. They will try to destroy me. If they do, make sure these photos get to the right people. - Lieutenant Kreiko. - With Artium. So where's your goon? Hi. Nice to meet you all. We meet again, and no American woman to hide behind now. You've got your tiara, let's do it. And I have poor, dead Nicky's money. Go to hell. Safe journey. $100,000 American. - Good. We're going now. This meeting never happened, we were never here. If we don't walk out of here in one hour, photographs of you and Lieutenant Kreiko together will be passed onto the press. They were taken by your good friend Vladimir. Real Kodak moments. You're gonna have a tough time explaining why you and the head of the Nebski militia precinct are making a deal for a stolen piece of Russia's history. Well I'd say the problem is all with Kreiko, especially since he's already paid me. And the tiara is safely on its way. Good day, my friends. This way. Quick! Back door. Sure. Go go, go, go. Go go, go go go! - Goodbye Sasha. - Pavrick. You're sure you do not want to go to a hospital. No no no, there'd be too many questions. Look, he just grazed me, it looks a lot more serious than it is. But you and Papa. Sasha. You can use this money. Your father sacrificed his whole life for this country and its treasures, you use it. I was never meant to stay here, you know. - I don't want you to go. - I don't wanna go either. Then stay with me. My life is in America. And mine is here in Russia. - Why so sad? - Judd? I thought I would never see you again. You weren't supposed to. So you changed your mind? Well it was a long flight. When we landed in Los Angeles, I looked around and you weren't there. But your life is in America. No Sasha. No, my life is here, with you. Listen to me, we're gonna go ahead with that deal and since no one else would move over here. - So Juddson will. - You bet Juddson will. Judd. Papa, Judd has come back to stay! This is excellent, this is good! Listen, got some news for both of you. Check this paper out. Japanese yakuza are rumored to be searching for the elusive Artium for selling them a worthless and fake tiara. Lieutenant Kreiko is already in jail. And the strangest of all, somebody somehow put back Catherine the Great's tiara. I'm telling you, you just can't make this stuff up. Go on, you two, get out of here. See you later. There is something I have to show you now that we are partners. Ooh, partners, I like the sound of it. I saw that the hermitage museum had added this to their collection and I was thinking that perhaps it might be. No no, no no no no no, my dear, you are permanently retired. We are going to find a new way for you to go. But the Fabruge eggs, they have such a rich Russian heritage. Yes but you are officially out of the heritage business and all that it implies, or else, or else. You may find yourself in dire need of a great lawyer. Oh well that is one thing we both completely agree on.
