[ALARM SOUNDING] Take over, Jim. I'm going below. Yes, sir. Nothing, huh? Well, that does It. We can't wait here any longer. I'm sorry, sir. You served on the Grayfin,didn't you? Exec. She was a good ship. She was the best, Bill. Communique, sir. COMSUBPAC. That all? Yes, sir. Oh, uh, Morris. Send the following, SS-240 to COMSUBPAC. Attempted to rendezvous with the Grayfinthree nights, results negative. That's all. Yes, sir. Prepare to get underway, Bill. Take your course from this. Meet the Albany. What does that mean? As far as I'm concerned, It means we'll only have to wait just a while longer. Sir? To get a couple of Jap ships the Grayfin. Personnel coming aboard. Special assignment. All details... Commanding officer UDT. UDT. Underwater demolition team. Now, what the devil do they want? A ride. Lieutenant Hayes, UDT 12 requests permission to come aboard. Permission granted. I'm Lieutenant Fourtney, executive officer. Glad to meet you. I have special orders for the Captain. Can I bring my men aboard? I assume that's included in your orders. Yes, it is. Bring them on. All right, Chief. All right you guys, come on. Where do you want us? We'll arrange space forward. Kingsley. Yes, sir. Get a couple of men and store this equipment in the crew's mess. Now, you men can leave your gear here and follow me. Just our luck, a pig boat. Pig boat? What's your name? Malzone. Joseph, sir. Yeah. Well this happens to be a submarine, Malzone. A fleet ship of the United States Navy, and the best of its kind in the world. I could call it a pig boat. The crew can call it a pig boat. But don't let me hear you call it a pig boat again. Yes, sir. What's the trouble? There's no trouble. Follow me. Leave your weapons with the deckhand. He'll store them with the rest of your gear. Ed, take them below. Hey, uh, who are these guys? Looks like the enemy. Maybe we're being invaded. Yeah. It is the enemy. Maybe we should toss them out, huh? Okay. You want to throw them out or shall I? Let's flip. Knock it off. You got room for all those men down there, Chief? I can hot sack some of my boys back aft. Hiller, you want to move out? Now, Lieutenant, I'll, uh, I'll take your orders up to the Captain while you're getting your men settled. All right, Sarge, you can use these empty sacks now. Okay. Davayo, you down there. Malzone, you up there. Givens, you're in the penthouse. Okay, let's snap it up there. It ain't the Ritz. Well, what's cooking? Don't know yet. Guess it's all there, though. Here. Yeah, It figures. "Transport UDT group to Marshall Islands. "Avoid contact with enemy." Avoid contact with the enemy. "Contact guerilla forces on island. Locate..." What's the matter? They found her, Bill. The Grayfin? On Bikini Atoll. Bikini Atoll? That's a graveyard. Why would he go in there? Rusty Miller would have sailed his ship anywhere to get a shot at something good. Yeah. I wonder what it was. COMSUBPAC's afraid the Japs will try and find and salvage the equipment. We're supposed to see that there's nothing left to salvage. In other words, we've hauled 24 torpedoes 2,000 miles for nothing. Why us? Because It says so here. Let's get started. Take the top one, Davayo. Ah, nuts to you, man. The Chief say I take this one. But I... I don't like heights. I get dizzy. Look, up there, you're still below sea level. [GROANS] All right, get up there. He's liable to fall on both of us. He's big enough to eat hay. You'd think they'd find a better place to put these things. What's the matter, Joey? I thought you liked explosives. Yeah, but I don't take them to bed with me. Everybody all set? Yeah, fine. Come on, I'll take you to your bunker. This is the control room, conning tower above. When your men get a mess call, they'll come through here. This is the crew's mess and there's your equipment. Everything all right? Yeah, everything's here, yeah. But, um, I'm not so sure that everything's all right. No? What's the trouble? I thought maybe you could tell me. I've got a feeling we're not exactly welcome aboard. Welcome aboard. What's eating you? This mission got you worried? Now look, Hayes. Our orders are to take you safely to your destination and bring you back again. That's three days each way, plus the time it takes you to do your job. So for the better part of two weeks, this is one sub whose torpedoes the Japs don't have to worry about. So that's it. That's It. Lieutenant, we didn't ask for you or your submarine. And I want to tell you something else. Now, outside of walking, a sub is about the last way I'd pick to travel. Scared? Hell yes, I'm scared. Weren't you the first time you ever got on one of these? Sometimes I still am. Will you look at the size of these things? How's a man supposed to fit in there? Try a little grease, will ya? Well, if there's anything I hate, It's being cooped up. Hey, what do you know about being cooped up? I could tell you about it. Just try living with four brothers sometime. All jammed up into a crummy little three-room apartment. You know, I never had a bed of my own until I joined the Navy. Yeah. I guess I wanted that more than anything else. My own room, my own bed, my own place to sleep. Hey, do you know what I used to dream about? An island. Yeah. I read someplace where you can buy these islands if you had enough money. And I said to myself, "Oh yeah, yeah, that's for me. "That's for me and Roxanne." And when I got married and had kids, why, every one of them could have a whole bedroom. All their own. Sounds real nice. All right, fellas, let's get some sleep. Yep.

Come ahead. Sleep all right? I surprised myself. You know, uh, this thing is quite a ship. 1,815 tons. 115 tons more than a destroyer. Only we're a lot slower than a destroyer, and not as well armed. About the only thing we can do that a DD can't is, uh, go underwater, and that's not as good a trick as it sounds. How do you mean? FOURTNEY: Sometimes you can see its shadow down to 100 feet. With sonar, you can find it even when you can't see it. You're pretty encouraging. Well, maybe It isn't quite that bad. Anyway, for a submarine man, it's the only game in town. [PHONE BUZZING] Bridge, Fourtney. Yes, sir, he is. Right away. The Captain wants to see you in the ward room. Dining room in the rear, gentlemen. Come on, let's hustle. Little chow. Come on. Down! Ooh. Ah, look, graceful like this, see? What's the matter with you? Chow, huh? Right, sir. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Come in. Hello, Lieutenant Hayes. How do you do, sir? Captain Carey. Sit down. Well, It looks like you got a rough one on your hands. It could be. Could be? Huh. All we have to do is sail through 1,000 miles of enemy water, put you ashore in occupied territory, and hope you can quietly blow up a sub under the nose of the Japanese. Well, we'll try to get you there. I guess after that, you'll know what to do. We're pretty well briefed, sir. We're to meet guerrillas who'll lead us to the location of the sub. We'll do the rest. The trouble with guerrillas is you never know whose side they're on until it's too late. Leave plenty of room in your thinking for unknown factors. Maybe you can clear something up for me, sir. Why this, uh, this particular sub? Radar, Hayes. As you probably know, the Japs are very slow in developing radar on their own. Even now what they have is pretty poor. It's one of the few advantages we have in this war. And right now we're equipping the fleet with a new microwave unit that antiquates even our own new models. And the SS-342, that particular sub had one of those prototypes aboard. I see. Hayes, there were some fine good men aboard the Grayfin. They were good friends and good shipmates. I want you to give them a good send-off. I think I understand. I don't want anything left. MAN ON PA: Dive! Dive! Dive! [ALARM SOUNDING] Green board! Main induction shut and locked! Main induction shut and locked! What's happening? Ow! You're burning me. That's what's... Ow! 100 feet, level off. 100 feet, level off. What is It? Airplane. Well, welcome to the fraternity. How do you feel? Out of place. CAPTAIN CAREY: Periscope depth, Bill. Periscope depth. All stop. Up scope. Ah, looks clear, Bill. Surface when ready. Yes, sir. Down scope. [ALARM SOUNDING] Do you ever get used to this kind of thing? Well, yes and no, Hayes. The diving you get used to, but looking through this eyepiece never knowing what you're liable to see, that you never get used to. Smoking lamp is out, junior. [WAVES CRASHING] [RADAR PINGING] Radar contact, sir. Captain, radar contact. Yes, sir. HILLER: Contact bearing 127. Come to course 127. Course 127, sir. We'll close and determine their course. Captain. Looks like a convoy, sir. Get your lookouts, below. Standby to dive. Yes, sir. Dive, dive, dive. [ALARM SOUNDING] It's a convoy all right, sir. I can't tell how many, but it looks like they're going to go right over us. Rig for silent running. Maneuvering, rig silent. Pipe down, you guys. What the hell is that? Sonar trying to get a fix. What does that mean? It means they want to find our address so they can send us some presents. Some nice little 400-pound presents. Knock It off, will ya? Everyone all right in here? Yeah. Can't seem to sleep for some reason, though. Hey, maybe it's one of our ships. I don't think it'd make much difference. As far as our Navy's concerned, there aren't any American subs in these waters. There's not a damn thing we can do. [SONAR BEEPING] They're headed this way, sir. Attention. Attention. This is the Captain speaking. There'll be absolutely no sound aboard this ship. Still coming. Still coming. Contact. Here he comes. All ahead, hard right rudder, come to 180. Hang on, honey. Turning around. 500 yards on starboard bow. Take her down to 200 feet. Steady as you go. Depth, 200 feet. That last bunch went off below us. If they've reset, the next will be too high. They'd better be. They're running right above us. We'll try to break out as soon as he loses sonar contact. Yes, sir. Go, now, now, now. Right on the button. 100 feet above us. Screws going away, sir. Zig-zagging. You threw him off good, sir. [EXHALES] Come to course 127, all ahead one third. Re-rig for silent running, one half hour. Aye-aye, sir. Rig silent. They out of ammo? Don't bet on it. Hey, I don't hear them anymore. I think we've, uh, I think we've been through the bad part. You mean there's a good part? FOURTNEY: Secure for battle stations. All clear. All clear. Why don't somebody turn them fans on? Don't run your battery down, junior. All right now, maybe we can get some sleep around here. Sleep? The Navy ought to fill this thing full of beans and tie a label to it. You look a little green, junior. This duty too rough on you? You know something, swabby? You got a big, fat mouth. You're real tough. Well, why don't we run a test. Knock it off, Givens. Get back in your bunk. All right, Nolan. Listen, I'm warning you for the last time. The next time you stick your arm in the cage, I'm going to let somebody chew it off. Now listen. Shove off. The rest of you, now get some sleep, you understand? If you can't sleep, fake it. That's an order. All right, what's the trouble? How much longer we gonna be in this tub? Not too long. Well, I hope not. Or else we won't have a team when we get there, we'll have a pack of wild cats. I'll see what I can do so we can work a little steam out.

[ALARM SOUNDING] Go on! Come on, get down. Hurry up. Come on, come on. CAPTAIN CAREY: Attention. Attention, Lieutenant Hayes. This is the Captain speaking. I see you in the ward room as soon as this ship's secure from diving stations. What's the situation? Radar contact. Unidentified aircraft. All right, run submerged until we clear, use your own judgment. Aye-aye, sir. You were the OD? Yes, sir. Then report to me as soon as we secure from battle stations. Aye-aye, sir. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine any more stupid or unmilitary-like behavior on the part of an officer. Now, I extended to you and your men the privileges of the deck in these waters because of the unusual nature of your mission and in the interests of keeping you fit. Now, do you consider a fist fight in those interests? In this case, sir, I did. Oh, you did. Yes, sir. Well, did you also consider the danger involved to this ship? Sir, with your permission, the order to dive was given immediately. Mr. Cale, you were officer of the deck, and as such, you were responsible for the deck. Now, just how did this happen? I don't know, sir. I suppose I looked forward for a moment, and when I looked back, they were at It. But the, uh, deck was cleared in good order, sir. I didn't say it wasn't. Under the circumstances, it was nothing but a miracle. That's all, Cale. Thank you, sir. Hayes, I don't understand you. I really don't. Can you give me one good reason for your actions on deck? Yes, sir, I think I can. There are six of us, and I need every man. Now, I can't go ashore with a crew that's ready to tear each other's throats out. Mister Hayes, the fight was between one of your men and one of mine. No, sir. The fight was between one of my men and everything this submarine means to them. Fear, confinement, helplessness. One way or another, It was going to come out. All right, Hayes. If it'll make your men feel any better, you can tell them we expect to sight the Bikini Atoll at about 2300. Thank you, sir. We'll be ready. That's all, Hayes. What did they say the name of this place was? I don't know. Bikini. Bikini? Sounds like something you take for heartburn. [CHUCKLES] Hey, what are you doing that for? Well, just in case. In case of what? Well, he didn't send us here for no bayonet charge. He's going to make grass skirts for bald-headed natives. Let him sharpen it, it might come in handy. For what? Peeling coconuts. During the day, we'll lie submerged about here. Every night at 2000, we'll surface for recharging. Under no conditions are you to attempt to make visual contact with us. If you need any help or you want to come back to the ship, we'll be here. Sorry I can't take you any closer. Now, you should meet the guerrillas about here. You're to get across the island to where the S-342 is supposed to be. Visual contact with the island, Captain. Well, lots of success with your mission, Hayes. Thank you, sir. I'd better get my gear. Good luck, Hayes. Take good care of our pig boat. No sign of a signal, sir. Uh-huh. Captain... I see it. Maneuvering room. All stop. Jones. Yes, sir. Answer their signal. Two long and two short. Aye-aye, sir. Lieutenant Cale, tell Hayes over the side at, um, 0030. MAN 1: What the hell was that? MAN 2: Japanese patrol boat. Get a move on. MAN 1: Let's go! Let's go! Come on. [GRUNTING] Where is everybody? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Welcome! [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Let's get your gear and move on. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Everything's okay. He said the nearest Japs are 10 miles from here and the thick jungle protects us. Davayo, tell him we're here to find the sub that was sunk in the channel last month. An American submarine... Ah, yes. Sunk. Boom! You saw it? Well, can you take us there? Many Japanese. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I'll take you. Givens, Sherman, you stay here. Malzone, Davayo, your lungs. Reiko! Ed, brush up on your Tagalog. Chief doesn't carry his own gear. Oh. Oh, boy. And they expect us to win the war with this stuff. Me Yankee. Yankee. Yankee. Go long way, far off home. Bring food... Mmm-mmm. ...for you. [SPITS] Yankee, go home. [SCOFFS] Do you speak any English? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] That's what I figured. Davayo, ask him how far. Hey, Paul, how far is it? Not far. Not far, he says. That what he said when we left. Like three hours ago. Holy Pete, will ya look at that. Many Japanese. Is he kidding? It must be half their navy out there. Where's the American sub located? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] It's a salvage ship. HAYES: Looks like they've found her all right. Doesn't look like they're ready to raise her, though. There are no air hoses. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] I'd still like to get a closer look. Yeah, but how are we going to get past them? [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [BLOWING WHISTLE] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Paul. Shut up! Come on. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [YELLS] [GUN FIRES] Take them off if you want. [PAUL SCREAMING] Reiko! Come on. [TWIGS SNAPPING] You okay, Ed? Yeah. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Where's the kid? We lost him. Find the sub? Yeah. So'd the Japs. Sitting about 200 yards off shore. What else is new? Well, it couldn't be much worse. The bay's full of ships. And there are Japs all over the place. I don't think we have a chance getting in by the beach. Then how? By water. We'll take the raft as close as we can and swim the rest of the way. When? Well, the way I can see it, it's a... It's a one-way ticket. All right, fellas, let's go, come on, let's get some sleep. Come on, on the double. Twenty-four hours without sleep makes the Chief a cranky guy. Let's go. That's nice. Very nice. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] What? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] A little higher. I, uh... I wish you could understand me. I'd tell you how glad I am that you're here. And, uh, how beautiful you are. You are beautiful, you know that? Mmm-hmm. You're very, very beautiful. [WOMAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [ALL SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Wait a minute. What is he saying? He says there's a Japanese cutter coming down the coast, and it's a spy ship and they're searching the coast. Ask him how long before it gets here. [BOTH SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] One hour. Oh, that's trouble. Davayo, tell him we're going to need his help. Ed, I've got an idea. Any questions? No, we're all set. Say, where's Givens? Up on the rocks. The best seat in the house. Malzone, you get on down to the beach. Watch out for the gals. You bet I will. You know how to work that thing? Yeah, it's all coming back to me. I'll wait till they're in front of me before I fire, then you open up. Now, aim at the base of the radio antenna. You can handle it? Yeah. I can. Givens, we can't let them get a message through. Good luck. [WOMEN SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [WHISPERING] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [GIRLS SCREAMING] Reiko. Reiko. [SCREAMS] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I'm sorry, Reiko. God, I'm sorry. [GROANING] Just take it easy, will ya? Gee, that hurts. Oh! Easy, damn it. [GRUNTING] Ow! Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. How's the wound? How do I know? I'm no corpsman. Which way did you say you were facing? I tell ya, a slug bounced off the rock behind me. And what are you laughing at? I didn't say a thing. Let's shove off. Watch it, will ya? HAYES: Two forty. It'll be up in about a half an hour. MAN: Sure hate to miss all the fun, Lieutenant. Hell of a way to wind up a mission. I'm sorry, sir. Don't worry about it, you. Just see that the Captain finds out about those ships in the bay. HAYES: Let's get into the suits. Malzone. Givens, you're next. Man, I don't know what I brought this thing along for. Well, you sure know how to use it. Yeah. Me, I always could shoot. Far back as I can remember. Not like my old man, though. You see, we lived in Oregon. Dad was a great one for hunting. Pheasant, grouse, deer, you name it. He started taking me with him as soon as I was big enough to stand up. You know, sometimes he used to come into my room so early in the morning, it feel like I hadn't been to sleep yet. He'd say to me, "Come on, son, duck's on the move". I'd jump up, you know, like I was wide awake. Run down to the car and we'd drive away. Wasn't 30 seconds before I was asleep again. He'd have to wake me up before we got there. Sounds real nice. Yeah, it was. Sitting there all hunched up in our jackets to keep warm. Watching the sun come over the hills. Everything around us cool, wet and new. Just me and the old man. [CLEARS THROAT] Come on, kid, I gotta get dressed, huh? Yeah. Hold on, Chief. You know, your lieutenant is a very stubborn man. Yes, sir. A little unorthodox perhaps, but maybe that's what it takes. Your Chief Fennelly just got a flesh wound. He'll be all right. Could we get through? Yes sir. COMSUBPAC acknowledged the message with a "Well done." Good. Only hope we have some units in the area to take advantage of it. That lagoon sounded like quite a target. Yeah, quite a target. Now, Bill, this is the course we're going to follow. See? I want full speed. From now on, we run submerged. Well, what do you think? Can we make it? The Grayfingot in. There's no reason why we can't. Good. Get on it. Yes, sir. We're going in after them? That all depends on you, my boy. Do you have another set of lungs? Yes, sir, I got the best set of lungs in the US Navy. Right here. Salvage boat ahead. Take her in. Okay. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Malzone. Givens. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [ORDERS IN JAPANESE] [RINGING BELL] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [ORDERS IN JAPANESE] Set the throttle and come on. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Ha-ha! This is one message, fellas, you're not going to forget. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] HILLER: Depth 100 feet, sir. [AIR ESCAPING] [SONAR PINGING] Something's coming, sir. [PHONE BUZZING] Fourtney. No, sir. No sign of them yet. Right. I understand. We'll give them a few more minutes. [METAL CLANGING] MAN: Lieutenant... They're here now, sir. Drain the tank. Everything's all clear down here, sir. Yes, sir. All ahead two thirds. Periscope depth, Cale. Hey! Chief. Hey. Look who's here. How are you? Nice to see you. Nice to have you aboard. Hey, how'd it go, Lieutenant? Where is Davayo? That did it. That got it. The Grayfin? Yeah, I think so. Come right to 225. Full ahead emergency, let's get out here. Screws bearing 294, sir. Full stop, up periscope. Make ready all forward tubes! Yes, sir. All forward tubes ready, sir. Stand by to fire tubes one, two, three and four. Range? Range 1,100. Firing bearing? 042. Standby to fire one. Fire one. Fire two. Fire three. Fire four. We got one, a hit. That only leaves 15 or 20 to get us. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Hey, how many torpedoes did we fire? Well, let's have a look. Up periscope! [ALL CLAMORING] I see carrier planes. They're bombing the whole fleet. Steady as you go. Let the Airedales finish the Job. Down scope. Attention! Attention, all hands, this is the Captain speaking. Units of our carrier force have attacked the ships in the Bikini lagoon. The last time I looked, they were running out of Jap targets. Also, the UDT unit might be interested to know that a certain salvage vessel seems to be missing along with everything that was near It. I told ya. I told ya. Boy I'll bet you they never knew what hit them. I puts enough stuff on there to blow them sky high. Hey. Hey, where's my torpedo? Come on, you guys, what did you do with her? Where'd you put her? Who? Roxanne. She was on my torpedo. Oh, no! You couldn't have. NARRATOR: A tiny coral atoll. A barren spot in the face of the vast Pacific. Bypassed, overlooked, ignored by man for 2,000 years. Its name would not be heard again until it became synonymous with the greatest destructive force ever known. How will men remember Bikini? As a way station in a war of the Pacific? As a symbol of the atomic future? Perhaps. But man mocks his fate and laughs at destiny, and chances are Bikini will be remembered for something else. Not a bomb, not a battle, but a bathing suit.
