Alright, back in my hometown. Not under the greatest circumstances but… Let’s do this. -Hey, Chad! -Hey, Chris! Holy crap, hey! Thought I’d see you here. Yeah, right? It’s been so long! Lisa would be so happy for you to be here with her. -Yeah I’m sorry it’s under these circumstances. -Yeah. -So hard to believe she’s gone. -Good to see you guys, though. She would have been happy you are here, it means a lot, you know? But seriously, dude. How is the filmmaking thing going? You know? It’s going good, I mean, uh, I just joined the union as a permit worker. You know, making my way up. Oh, that’s great! I’ll be able to say ‘I knew him when!’ -I hope so! -Yeah. [elevator door opens] -Be careful, son. -Yeah, thanks mom. Thanks dad. This is just really weird. There you go. -Chad! Are you filming? -Mom... That’s not appropriate. Sorry, I’ll put it away. I’m just going to pay my respects to the family. I’ll meet you there soon. Crap. -Chad. -Father Anderson. How are you? -Sorry for your loss. -Thanks Mr. Mayor. -So sad. -It is sad. And uh.. so young. -Right? -Right. -It’s never a good time. -What can you say? Ah, I fucking hate funerals. God damnit... [someone screams from inside the church] [guests screaming] What? What the-?

[Lisa screams] [people screaming and running around] [Lisa breathing aggressively] [Lisa screams aggressively, Chad screams in fear] [Chad panting in fear] Lisa. Lisa. [people outside screaming] I gotta see what’s happening. Lisa. My daughter, My sweet... sweet daughter. You’ve come back. You’ve come back. It’s not her! It’s not her! [people screaming outside, Julia crying] Where did she go? [police siren outside] Where did she go? Lisa? [Police siren, Julia crying] -It can’t be, it can’t be! -I mean... I know... -We’re going to figure out what happened… What’s going on. -​What happened? I don’t understand! We’re. We don’t understand. There is some weird situation inside the church and I mean… I can’t even, I, I don’t…. Chad, get that camera away! Sorry... [Julia continues crying] We’re going to figure it out. Whoa, Chris! Chad! Oh my god was that not the coolest shit ever?! [starts wheezing] [police siren, radio static noise, ambient sound] [car drives by] Hey what’s going on everyone? It’s Dom here. Filming my first documentary with the gang. I don’t know. I don’t know what to say, we’re behind the scenes. Anyways, I’ll introduce the gang to you so we’ve got Chad. What's going on, dude? Dude. Dude. Behind the scenes footage. Quick. And go! Well uh, I guess I’ll tell them I’m driving my two broke-ass friends from Toronto to my hometown. If you guys had a frickin’ license you could rent a car. -Alright, I see how it is. -But uh, nope! Driving to my hometown, Girl came back from the dead guys. Yeah. We’re going to find out what’s happening. I don’t know, what do you have to say about this Ms. Assistant Director? Uh, I think this could be our big break. I think this is going to be great for us, I’ve always wanted to do documentaries, you know? Never seen anything like this. This is real shit. Uh..I think it’s going to be great. I think it’s a great opportunity to learn and... Better than PAing. Fucking way better than PAing! Tired of that shit, been doing that for way too long. I don’t know, I just don’t know. I mean, I’ve known Lisa since like, we were in high school together... Elementary school... She’s just... she’s always been weird. Even her mom and family, it’s just... I mean like, she used to say that her house was haunted by this demon. She... she even drew me a picture of it once. It’s creepy. I just, I don’t know what to think. I really don’t know what to think. Katie. Are we taking the train back? I don’t even think, I don’t know if that’s an option. By the way, there’s no train. Great, yeah, see? There’s no train!? We’re stuck here, great! What do you mean there’s no train!? Well, there’s … there’s one bus. [music playing in the radio] Okay, On 3.. Scare the shit out of her. Okay. Ready? Okay? 1, 2, 3… [Katie screams] Oh my god! [Chad and Dom laughing] You guys are fucking assholes.

Town of Minto, -Yeah! -Harriston. -Yeah! -Brought you city folk out. -Yeah! -How are you guys feeling? -Yeah! [Chad and Dom chuckle] -Can you be more excited Dom? -Woo. [chuckles] Jazz hands, jazz hands. [Dom chuckles] -Alright, ready for it? -Come on in, come on in, come on in. Ready? Go. [camera clicks] Alright, there it is guys. That’s where Lisa lived. That’s where the zombie of Harriston lives? It’s fucking freaky, man. Yeah, dude. Yeah. -Wow. -Yeah. Ah. Okay, dude. It’s a gorgeous place, man. And Mrs. Taylor? How is she? She’s good. Snacks, I want more snacks. Mom’s got lots of food. Oh my god, we're set. -Hello hello! -Hey, mom. Welcome home. It’s good to see you. This is Katie. -Hello, nice to finally meet you. Hello. -Nice to meet you! -And uh, this is Patricia. -Hi Mrs. Taylor. -Hi! -How are you? Here, grab this for a second. We’re already filming, okay! How are you?

Uh… no, actually. No? I got a nice bud here. -​Want to roll? -​You have bud? Yeah, wanna roll? Yeah I am. -You like it, right? -That’s fake. -You like it. -That’s fake. Look at it. Okay, stop, just relax. Look at it, come on! It’s fake. -Touch it. -​Ah it’s fucking real, dude! Touch it! [Chad chuckles] It’s get, get the fuck away from, [Katie laughing] get away from me, dude. I’m serious. Get the fuck away from me. [Katie Laughing] -Dude, get the fuck away from me. -I’ve been keeping this for a while for you. [Katie laughing] I’ve been keeping it- -Come on! -Get the fuck away from me, dude! -I’ll fucking start swinging, dude and you will never- -It’s nice, it’s just a little bug! -It’s just a little bug. -Chad?! -I’m so sorry Mrs. Taylor. -What are you doing?! -I’m so sorry Mrs. Taylor. -That’s a lot of cursing. -Yes, I understand. And although your son- -​Chad! Chad. Your son, he has a bug in his hand. -You know I like to joke. -I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. [Katie laughing] Okay, giving me a heart attack out there. [paper rustling] -This, this is what she said she saw. -Wow. -That’s fucked up. -Right? [people screaming in the video] This is it. What is that? [people screaming in fear] [people screaming] Get Chris, get Chris! [fast-forwarding] [keyboard clicks] Look at her! Jesus Christ, man. [keyboard clicks] [Julia crying] There was a situation inside the church and… -That’s the mom, right? -I don’t know. Listen, we gotta start with the mother. We gotta, we gotta interview the mother. -Yeah. -That’s where we start. -I understand we gotta interview- -People don’t scream like that unless they know something! Hey guys! Can I get you guys dessert or popcorn or something? Oh no, thank you. We’re okay thank you so much though. Mrs. Taylor. As a church minister, What is your take on the incident that just occurred? Sorry but .. With the funeral. Yeah, I.. I don’t want to talk about it. I just feel like we should just keep it in the town, you know? Until we know what we’re dealing with. And you just kind of coming here.. I think people are kind of getting upset about it, you know? Is there anything in the bible that may explain something about what happened? Yes, yes there... there is but I feel like we should just leave this. I mean, I can't believe she's still missing. When you say she’s missing, you mean Lisa? Yeah. It’s.. it’s bizarre, right? I mean, she’s been gone for four days. No one’s seen her. I’m scared to step outside. So.. you guys should just let me do the talking. She can be really weird, okay? I just don’t want to scare her. What do you mean weird, how? You’ll see. But.. What, is she violent? No, she’s just a little loopy. Well, I know karate. Well she knows crazy, so… Well, my sensei would argue that logic. Door's open. Hello Mrs. Harris? Let’s just go in. Mrs. Harris? Chad I think this is breaking and entering we should leave and come back- -She knows me. It’s okay. -The door’s unlocked. Mrs. Harris? Hello, It’s Chad? We are here to talk about your daughter. Hello. Maybe in the back room? Hello? Hello? Mrs. Harris. Let’s just leave. [Julia screaming] [Julia screaming] Whoa. Guys, Shhh. [Julia screaming] [Julia screaming] The basement. [Julia screaming] [Julia screaming] Mrs. Harris. Are you okay? What? Are you okay Mrs. Harris. Get out! Get out! She’s got a knife. Get out Get out. Go, go, go, go. -Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. -Oh god! What! Oh God. You crazy fucking bitch! -Fucking jesus. -What the fuck did you say to her, man? Her daughter, like Lisa. I remember her in school, She used to jump out of her seat and get on her chair and start screaming like there was a demon right there. She used to scare all of us. Maybe she’s just crazy. What about her dad, was he around. No mom said that he committed suicide when I was really young. I don't know what happened but… Sad. And this is it. Wow. Yo I can’t believe you owned this place, man. Wait till you see inside. That’s awesome. Cool. [people laughing and chatting in the background] So I mean like, after my dad passed away. I uhhh. I had this weird dream, where I saw him. And he told me to follow my dream of becoming a filmmaker. I was hesitant to ask mom, if she would be okay. But when I told her, she actually had a similar dream. And so she told me to go. So I sold this place, bought her the house and moved out. I wanted her to move in with me but there is no way I could get her out of the small town. I mean, all her friends are here, Church, everything so.. I mean, I still come back every couple weekends, this place will always be home. Chaddery, now you have us as your family too. Oh yeah, I'm so glad too. What a heartwarming moment. Let's cheers to chosen family. Yes. Yes, til the end. Salud. Till the end. As a matter of fact. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention for one second? Chad is back. [laughing] [sighing] That was fun. So. I needed that. Yeah. Needed that laugh. Yeah and that drink. And that drink. Laughs and drinks. What do you guys think we should call the documentary? You know what. We should put a question mark. Just a question mark. It is right now, but gotta think of something. Clever. Yo Chad! Hey Chris. Hey. What’s up buddy? Here to join me for some ganja. I never say no to that. Come on. Still filming the movie I see. Always, always, as you know it. This is Katie. -Hello Hi. -Hi, how are you? Good. How are you? -And this is Dom. -Hey how’s it going? Very well. How about you? Good, good, good. -Don’t mind the camera. -I see you got a few joints there. -Yeah you want some? -Looks like you are having a good time, Yes. I thought I was gonna be all alone tonight. How fucked was that funeral. I know. I have never seen anything like it. Like... Are we still looking for her? They are still looking for her. -Yeah. -But where is she? That’s the question. I mean I have heard of cases like this before you know. People you know… waking up from the dead. But the thing is that they never really were dead. People waking up while they are already buried. It’s... It’s weird. That’s quite unsettling. What's that? Unsettling. Thank you. It’s almost out. Hey, who's that. Hi, hello, -Hi, he’s so sweet. -Everybody, this is Spock. He comes and goes whenever he fucking pleases. Yes he does. Oh, he’s so handsome. Well. That is it of that one. Anyone cares to stay for another? No, I'm really tired. Thank you though. It’s okay. I'll stay for one. -Yeah. -Yeah, yeah I am down. We grew up together, fuck we are practically brothers you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Him and I would be fucking around in the town you know. Getting into trouble and shit. Yeah looks like you already got yourself into trouble. My bad my bad. That was a bad joke, bad joke. No it’s fine, any cripple jokes are down with me brother. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just give me a second, dude. Holy fuck! What? What the fuck is that? What? Over there in the house! [camera glitches] Careful Dom. [Dom slips] Oh fuck. I see someone, dude. Dom. [door opens] Chris, Chris where the fuck are you going, dude! Chris! What the fuck is that? It looks like. [Lisa screams] Oh shit! Oh shit, oh shit! [camera glitches] Chad! Chad! Chad! [camera glitches] What happened? Dude, the fucking dead girl, dude, the dead girl Lisa. What? Who? Lisa, the fucking dead girl, man, she went into fucking Chris’ house just right now, dude. What do- What do you mean? She just fucking walked from across the way, man, She went into Chris' house is what I'm telling you, dude. [Chris screams] Why did you bring me here, man? [Chris screaming] -Did you hear that? -Fuck. Why did you bring me here, man? No, no, no guys, Chad, Katie. Don’t go in there. What. Oh my god. [screams in joy] Oh Chris! Take it slow! [laughing and screaming in joy] I can’t- [screaming and laughing in joy] Easy, easy! I can’t believe it! [screaming and laughing in joy] I can’t believe this! You're walking! You're walking! Please tell me I'm not dreaming, It’s… it’s true! It’s true! It’s real! It's so real! [laughing in joy] Happy day. Oh Chris. [gasps] It’s okay. Yeah just… Getting used to it is all. Oh Yes, yes. Oh wow. Man, what.. What happened? This is gonna be great for your Hollywood movie. Chad. So, I was scared shitless. But she came in through the window like a ghost, or the door, She just phased right through it…. and then all she did was tell me to calm down. Then she put her hands on my legs like this and she was holding me tight and she wanted.. It was just…. Wait, wait.. Yo-you mentioned something when the camera was off. How did she communicate with you? Oh, I see. No, no. She never said anything out loud or verbally. She had a menacing look. It was very scary, but she…. Did it like… Telepathic. Yeah, she was inside my head, Chad. She put her hands on my legs like this, and they started to feel a bit cold. I’ve never felt that feeling before. And then I could feel the blood rush through them... Up and down. It was so nice and warm and then my muscles could twitch and then I could fucking walk, Chad. I could walk! What happened next? She asked to stay with me, Chad. What? She’s in the house. She wants to be my guest and that's the greatest honour. You mean, she’s here right now? Yeah, she’s in the basement. [sparks] Jesus! She’s in there. She’s in there, Chad! Whoa, Dom, get the light. [light turns on] Get it off the tripod. Follow me. She’s over here. She’s in there. What? Chris? Did you hear that? -Hear what? -Hear what? She’s in my head. You guys stay here. What did she say? Chris? Chris. What are you doing?[cat meows] What are you doing? What are you doing? She’s hungry. Chris, no, not your mom’s cat. He’s joking.. She’s in there… She wants to feed. Chris. -Whoa, wait. -Chris. Fucking…. [cat growling] [cat growling] [cat hisses] [Lisa screams aggressively, cat screams in fear] [cat suffering, camera glitches] -Jesus Christ! -Oh shit! [cat suffering] Jesus fucking Christ! The camera. [camera glitches] The camera is fine, dude. [camera glitches] Dom! Be careful! [camera glitches] Whoa, what are you doing? I gotta check it out, man, I gotta get it for the footage. [slurping, creepy breathing] Nope! Nope! Fuck that! -Fuck that.Fuck that. -What happened, what did you see? Okay. Okay. I’m not going to lie, I’m kind of freaking out right now. I’m okay for now but um…. I don’t know what’s happening. No, that’s not what I’m saying. It’s amazing that your son is walking again. No- Having that thing in your house is not right. JoAnn, I understand that. Okay but you have to admit it’s not natural, right? Clearly JoAnn doesn’t understand. You think that’s okay? [Dom chuckles] That is some freaky shit, dude! I know, I know. I think we got a documentary. It’s starting. Yes. I think someone else might need some convincing though. Wh-what do you mean, Katums? I just have a really bad feeling about this - I think this is a really - I don’t like this, I really think I just should go home. But come on, this could be our break. I mean you’ve been PAing for how long? Exactly. Right? We have a chance to make something. This is your big break. Do you really want to go back to get shit on? Thank you. Fuck it. Okay? Whatever. I’m sick of being a PA just it fucking sucks whatever, I’m in. Whatever. Yes, yes! [police siren] Hey what's going on here? You can’t trespass here. We know that house. It’s my friend’s house! Just wait right here we're trying to figure out the situation right now. Father Anderson! Wait… -Who called the cops? -What’s going on? You’re not giving us much information. We don’t know right now, we're trying to figure that out. Just give us a minute. Man, this isn’t good. What should we do? What can we do? Jesus. [faint screaming from inside] [faint screaming from inside] Are you sure Chris is in the house? Chris is in the house, I saw him, yeah. [social worker screams] [social workers running in fear] Hey! Hey you can’t pass here. Stay right here. Father Anderson, what happened!? -Get in the car! Get in the car! -What happened? -Guys, can you tell us something!? -Anything! Anything! What happened! [police siren] What happened! They’re leaving. Well, I went for a walk yesterday and I told everyone what happened. I told them that she can save us all. And.. is that what she wanted you to do? Yes, she did. All she wants is our love and our faith, Chad. In return. That’s it. [gasps] She’s ready. Ready for what, Chris? You’ll see, Chad. You will see. Hi… Hi. She’s going to take good care of you, okay? It’s okay, baby. She’s going to make the pain go away. No! It’s time to go! No. No filming! [boy screams] What’s going on? Yes! Is he okay? He’s great. [mother sobbing] Oh my god, she’s doing it. I told you. Yes. Yes. [celebrating and talking inaudibly] She just touched him, and instantly I could see a transformation in him. The black spots under his eyes started to disappear. The shaking was gone. I’ve got um, this infection going and the doctors don’t know what to do with it. I really hope that it's all true, what I’ve heard… See what she did with Chris? He’s walking again, it’s just amazing! And I know that her eyes are going to be healed, I just know they will. [gasps] [celebrating inaudibly] Look at the sunshine! I’m so excited. It’s really hard to have this and like, walk around school and everyone looks at me. So it’s really, I really hope it works, and that I don’t have to have this anymore. Kids can be mean sometimes, I bet. Yeah. Especially at this age. And mom, you excited about this? Oh I’m so excited. I really, I really hope. I... It worries me to hope, but I really hope.. She did it! She did it!! [celebrating] Oh, look at her! Here we go. -Thank you. -Absolutely. Our pleasure. We’re so glad. Would you like one? Careful on the steps, now. You are going to be so happy to be here, I know that you are! I understand that your son’s been sick for quite some time. For a very long time, it’s been hard. I’ve been sick for months, and I’ve been throwing up at least twice a day. It’s a miracle that it worked. [screaming in disbelief] Oh my god! Yes! I’m so glad you came dear! I’m so happy for you! Tell me, how was it? I can’t even describe how I felt, like… it was… I don’t know, like waking up. What brings you here today? The death of my father. He was just, uh, taken, uh, without… without warning. Yes! You wouldn’t believe it! Thank you very much. It’s a miracle. It’s a miracle. We saw him. We saw him. He’s here and he’s in a better place. [people cheering, shouting and celebrating] When I met Lisa, I can’t, uh, I mean I felt it. I felt it immediately. She went through me. [people humming] I didn’t think what I felt was possible for a person to feel. It was beyond faith, it was, it was knowledge. I felt the knowledge and I felt the love. There is certainty that I feel now since I’ve been in contact with Lisa. It’s life changing. I feel like a new person. All those anxieties, all those fears, all that doubt, it’s just gone, it’s just gone. And it’s all thanks to Lisa. Are you okay mom? [sighs] No one comes here anymore. Did uh, did you talk to Father Anderson? No, he’s disappeared. No one’s seen him since he was in the room with that thing. He left me the weirdest voice message. Hello, Nicole. I’d personally like to apologize for leaving in such a hurry today. At the moment, I just had to get as far away from Lisa as possible. I am saddened to tell you that starting tomorrow, I will be going away. Burdening you with the duties of the church. -I have to go away for now. -Why are they doing that? My father used to tell me to fear God. [people cheering] I always thought that was foolish. What the fuck? God was our friend. [tapping on the car] What are they doing? [tapping on the car] [tapping on the car] Okay. [tapping on the car] [tapping on the car] Guys! [tapping on the car] Chad! What are they doing?! [tapping on the car] [tapping on the car] -What are they saying!? -Just go around them Chad. Oh my gosh, which way am I going? Why? Why are they there!? Okay, okay this is freaky. I devoted my entire life to God. But now, I’m 100% at loss here. I must take some time to rethink everything. My beliefs, my faith, everything. To get some clarity. This can’t be it. This can’t be the ultimate truth. There must be some trickery at play here. [dog sniffing and panting] [camera clicks] -We gotta get everybody that was at that house. -Yes. Like, we gotta talk to everybody. Yes, and you have numbers? I can get numbers. Perfect. Perfect, we’re good. I am so sorry to interrupt this conversation. What? That dog of yours just took the most impressive shit I’ve ever seen in my life. Hey, that’s not my dog, he just shits in my yard all the time. Get out! It’s not even your dog? That’s Chris’ dog, man! -Okay, have you noticed that anybody that meets Lisa just changes completely? -Yeah. Know what would be good for the documentary? What? If one of us went in there. [Dom chuckles] Yes! Yes! Not me though. Well, I was thinking about myself, but….. I’m not sure. Okay, yeah I’d think about that one. Smart thinking. -Are you sure you want to do that? -We gotta find out what happens. Chad, Chad, who is that? Let me see, Katums. It’s Father Anderson. What’s he doing back in town? I don’t know. What is he doing? Does he usually do shit like that? Uhh… no. I don’t know what you guys do up here! He’s got the rhythm going though. Jesus. He’s just blessing Chris’ house. Okay, I guess that makes sense. But like, just in the middle of the road.. Like? -Holy shit. -Jesus Christ! -Okay shit we gotta go! We gotta go! -Okay. Okay. Father Anderson! Father Anderson! [camera glitches] [Katie screams in fear] -Is he dead!? -I don’t know! [camera glitches] I don’t understand why the fuck would he do something like that, dude! -Father Anderson! No! Oh my God! -No mom, mom, mom! [camera glitches] Don’t look! Don’t look, don’t look! What did he do? No, no, no, no! [glitches] Oh my god what did he do! [camera glitches] [camera glitches] Katie, Katie, Katie come over here, baby. They’re taking him away. Why would he do that? He's the strongest person I know. Listen, I think you should just get a good night's sleep, okay? I’ll make you some tea okay? We’ll deal with it in the morning, okay? How’s she doing? Stop it. [camera bumps] There’s something very wrong here. That thing in your house is not normal. Just call the police. Have you not seen enough? The whole town is experiencing it. Oh just meet with her once. Just once and you’ll be a believer, I guarantee it! Father Anderson met with that thing yesterday, he ended up killing himself in the street. You didn’t even come out of your house to see what was going on. What’s wrong with you? Father Anderson killed himself because he couldn’t handle the truth. There is something very wrong. That thing is not God. There is something very sinister going on here. How could you say that? She’s done nothing wrong. Just meet with her and you’ll be a believer. You know what? I will. I’m going to do this and prove you wrong. Mom, mom. I don’t think it’s a good idea. No, Chad, I have to do this. Okay. Your mother is stronger than she seems. This is not a good idea. JoAnn I’m worried about you, I’m telling you, this isn’t right! Be careful with the steps! Mom, mom… I don’t trust this. [sighs] Just….. I’ll be fine. [Lisa growling and giggling] [Lisa growling and giggling] Mom, be careful! [Lisa growling and giggling] [Nicole breathing heavy in fear] You are not God. And there is nothing that you can do to prove it to me. [Nicole breathing in fear] [camera glitches, Nicole screams] What the fuck is happening? What is she doing to her!? Just wait Chad. [Nicoles inhales intensely] [camera glitches, Nicole screams] [Nicole screams in fear] Mom! Mom! Help me! Help me! Mom! I'm sorry! I’m sorry! Please forgive me, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to doubt you, please! Please forgive me. [Nicole sobbing] Mom, [Nicole sobbing] Mom. Oh god, I didn’t mean it! I didn’t mean it! Mom. [Nicole gets startled] Mom. Chad!?! Where are you!? -Mom, mom, I’m right here. -I can’t see you! -I’m right here, mom. -Where are you!? Mom, I’m right here. [Nicole screams in terror] Chad! What’s happening!? [Nicoles screams in terror] [Nicoles screams in terror] JoAnn! You said she’d be safe! [Nicoles screams in terror] Mom! [Nicoles screams in terror] [Nicole screams in terror] Mom! [Nicole crying] [Nicole crying] It’s okay. [Nicole crying] It’s okay. I’m right here. [Nicole crying] I’m right here, mom. It’s okay. It’s okay. Hey, hey, what's going on with your mother, dude? What’s going on with your mother, dude? Fucking Chris. -Chad? Chad!? Where are you going? -Chad!? Stop! Chad! Chad, stop! Chad! Chris! Chad. Chris! Get out here, I need to talk to you! Chris! Chad? -Chad? Just stay calm, Chad. -What the fuck is going on with my mother?! -What did she do to her!? -She was being saved! She wasn’t being fucking saved, look what she did to her! Are you abandoned? We all need to be saved, Chad! We need to be saved! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Relax, relax! Come on, come on! Look at my mother! Look at my mother! [wind blowing] Come on, mom. You have to eat something. Okay? Katie made this for you, it’s really good. Just have a bite? It’s okay. It’s okay. We may not have a documentary after all. [camera glitches] And the fact that it’s Chad’s mother I don’t know if we should continue because… Hey man, can I talk to you? Yeah, yeah… Man, my mom needs help, I gotta get her out of this town. Okay. What? You guys are going to be taking off? What are you doing? Yeah, if you want to stay, you can stay, but me and Katie are leaving. Stay for what? I’m not staying here, are you kidding me?
