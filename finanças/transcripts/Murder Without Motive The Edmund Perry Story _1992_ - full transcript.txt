- We live in an age of boundless expectations. An age where nothing seems beyond our grasp, and yet, this is an age of great responsibility. Yours is a generation to whom the torch of leadership will soon be passed, the next century will belong to you. You have a chance to make it a century of justice, hope and opportunity. The time to prepare for that responsibility is now. It is appropriate that this ceremony is designated a commencement, not a graduation. This day marks the beginning of the next chapter in your lives. For well over two centuries, the graduates of Phillips Exeter Academy have left the campus and gone on to great achievements. But, do not let your diploma give you a false sense of security, it is not so much a guarantee as a challenge. The knowledge you have acquired here at Exeter will gain in value as you apply it to your lives. You have the foundation upon which to build a worthy life, may your actions from this day forward make each and every one of you a credit, not just to yourselves, but to your family, your academy and your nation. - I am so proud of you! - Thanks, Ma. - Well, Eddie, you made it, Son. - Yeah, a lot of people didn't think I would. - Yeah, but we didn't listen to them, did we? - Didn't want to let you down, Ma. - You never let me down, not my boy. No, no. - Be right back. - Look at my baby. - I wanted to apologize to you, Sean. I owe you a lot, man. - So where you gonna go? - Stanford, you know, I figure I could get use to the California sunshine. - Junior, you gonna have to watch yourself up there at Cornell, your brother pushin' you. - I'll be fine, Mom. - We faced some crazy times, man. - Yeah, a little too crazy some of the time. Yeah. - Will ya write? Stay in touch? - You bet. - I just wanted to say-- - It's over now, another time, another place, maybe things could have been different? - Maybe. - Hey, ain't no two days alike. - We oughta be gettin' ready to go, it's a long drive. - You're next, girl, I got some plans for you, too. Sean, I thought the three of us might take a picture together. - Great, will ya take it for us? Testing, testing, one, two, three. Testing, testing, one, two, three. - It work all right? - Yeah, fine Sarg. - NYPD undercover, state of the art. - Hey, whatever works, right? And Louie? - What? - Try not to eat all the bagels this time, all right? - Sue me, I was hungry. Yeah! - You may think you're a hot shot of New Hampshire, but your home now and I own this court, come on! Come on, come on, show me. Don't try to bring that shot in here, man! Baby, bringin' it! Give it up, twice! What up, boy? Okay. Let's go. - Hey, just mind your own business. You back off! Let's get outta here! Police officer, help! - It's Hooten. Move, move! How is he? Look at him, what the hell do ya think? It the perp breathin'? - Barely. - Hey, he's clean, cuff him. I gotta get him in the car, give me a hand. - What about him? - Regulations say he's gotta go in an ambulance, he stays. Come on! There were, two black males both young. They jumped me and, I shot one of 'em. - Come on, people, let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on. I don't believe this, you guys wanna take the cuffs off of him? Okay, I want 200 milligrams of narcan, get the EKG started and call Dr. Moore, get ER 3 prep, stat. - How'd it go down? - One punk tried to mug the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. - Van Hooten said there were two guys that jumped him. - The kid was the only one we saw, Sir. Here's his wallet. - Says his name's Perry, he goes to some, some kind of academy or somethin'. - Let me see. What the hell? - What's the matter? - I gotta call the commissioner. Well? - Kid's got a clean record, nothin' on him. - Nothing except the fact he just graduated from the best prep school in the country. Are you sure he's the one that jumped our man? - Officer Van Hooten ID'd him, Sir. The press is gonna get ugly, Perry was supposed to start a summer job this week for a Wall Street firm. He just received a scholarship to Stanford University. - Look, a policeman got attacked and beaten, he fired his weapon in defense of his life. Now if young Perry got hit by mistake, yes, that's a tragedy, but if he was there, in the commission of a crime, now scholarship or no scholarship... Let's just take it easy, pray it doesn't get any worse. - I'm sorry, we did everything we could, your son never regained consciousness. I'm really very sorry. All right, here he comes. A statement Mr. Commissioner? Is this another example of unnecessary, deadly force at minorities in this city often complained about? - We believe Officer Van Hooten acted properly. A full-scale investigation is taking place. - Many people don't trust the police investigation to be completely even-handed. Perry had no weapon, why did your officer fire? - We don't know all the circumstances yet, we'll let you know when we have more answers. - A boy is dead, Commissioner, a model kid with a clean record, an excellent reputation. He was shot down like a common criminal, why? - Hi, Dad, sorry I missed breakfast with you guys. - I remember a kid from Harlem you introduced me to at your graduation, what was his name? - Eddie Perry, what's up? I'm sorry. My God. - It says he was trying to mug a police officer. This can't have happened? - It doesn't make sense? Here's a boy who had every opportunity, a kid from the inner-city could wish for, every opportunity any kid could wish for. So how do the police expect people to believe that he would risk it all for some petty street crime? It doesn't make sense? - Yeah. It's time to stop the killing of our talented young men! Yes! The police that kill first and ask questions later. Yes! It's the new form of militia. They don't value black life! - Yes! - Eddie was one of our shining stars, I hope he's gonna help change things. - Yes! - Make this community better! - Yes! - Give us self-respect. Yes! But, they want to kill our hope. Run down our self-respect. Officers of the New York City Police Department, your arms and hands are dripping with blood! - It doesn't make any sense? - It's some crazy times, man. It doesn't make any sense? - Hey, yo, hey! I'm lookin' for your boy, Tyree. - So? Have you seen him? - No. - Well, when you see him, tell him I'm lookin' for him. - Do I look like Western Union to you? Man, get your hands off me before I kick your big butt up and down 114th Street. So you bad now? - Eddie? - You and me, for real, one day. - Who was that? - Nobody. - Didn't I tell you about fightin' with these fools around here, they'll kill you without a second thought. - Mom, chumps like Pedro are out here all the time, if I want to walk the streets, I have to deal with them one way or another. - Well, maybe what I better do is get your behind off these streets like I did your brother. Ma. - How come you're not in school already? - I'm waitin' for Tyree and them. - I'm goin' in, I'm goin'. - There he go! - Eddie, Eddie, Eddie! - See, man, waitin' for you guys made me late. - Chill, Eddie, nothin' goin' on in the building no ways. - Hey, yo, man, you watch out for Pedro 'cause he's after you. I'm not waitin' on Pedro, man, he mess with me, I got somethin' for him. - Hold it right there. Okay, Tyree, let's see what you got in your hand. - Nothin', Mr. Lee. - Let's have it. Leave us alone, we ain't done nothin'. - Not yet, you ain't. Tyree, I've known your folks since we was kids, I don't want to get into a thang with you. - You don't understand, Mr. Lee, I need this. - Yeah, man, somebody's after him. - Who? Okay, Ty, when you got somethin' real to say to me, you know where you can find me. All right, y'all get to class. Move. - Watch your back, bro. - See y'all. - Hey, wait, forget it, Tyree man, look stay away from Pedro, Pedro's a punk. He ain't gonna do nothin' if there's a crowd. So, I'll meet you in the cafeteria at lunchtime, you meet me in the hall afterschool, we'll leave together, all of us, all right? - Yeah. - Check y'all later. She's just gonna ignore me now. - Okay, settle down. Settle down, you people are gonna have to do better. You need to moan and groan after all the time I spent going over current events with you, most of you still managed to mess things up. - Lighten up, Mr. Tolliver. - Cynthia, the Middle East encompasses part of North Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, among other places. Have you ever heard of any of those countries? - Yeah. - Then why did you identify the Middle East with being next door to Vietnam, which is in the Far East? What's the difference? - I don't see what's so funny, Hassan? You could not place the Middle East either, and you have a Muslim name. - Man, I ain't no Muslim, I ain't no Muslim. - Ain't? - I mean, I'm not a Muslim. I'm a Baptist, my mom just named me Hassan because she likes it. - Stand up. All of you! Look out those windows. Now you think that your jokes and your lazy mistakes is gonna get you over? Well, you can rot in those streets down there or you can thrive in the world beyond Central Park. You can be a deadbeat, or you can make something out of your lives, it's up to you! But you give me those jokes and those lazy mistakes, don't blame me if you find yourself a dead beat. Eddie! Can you wait a moment? - Yes, Mr. Tolliver? - You obviously did your reading. - Yeah, my mom, my mom keeps on top of me. - Have a seat. I gotta meet somebody in the cafeteria. - It'll only take a minute. - I really have to go. - This won't be long, it's important. How is your brother doing up at Westminster Academy? - Okay, I guess. - You're doing real well here, all A's and B's, you work hard, you're just the kind of student that A Better Chance program is looking for. - You want me to go to a prep school like my brother? - Eddie, those are the schools that take the best and brightest, and turn them into leaders of tomorrow. - But, but, my friends, my mom and pops, I like it here. This is where I belong. - Where you belong is with the best, don't ever forget it. - I gotta go, Mr. Tolliver. - You think about it, this is a chance of a lifetime. Don't throw it away. Eddie, you can be a credit to your people. - Get off me! You hurt, get on up, get on up! Boy, you hurt, get up, get up! Get up, boy, get up! Get up! Get off me, man, get off! - Get back to your homeroom. All right, get back, he needs some room to breathe! Go get the nurse for me, please! I want all of you to go back to your homeroom. - You're gonna be all right, Ty, okay? Be strong, man. Come on, man! Come on. Hang in there. They say he might die! - Only God knows that for sure, honey. Eddie, I think you should take Mr. Tolliver up on his offer. - If I hadn't have been talkin' to Mr. Tolliver, I could have helped my friend! - Baby, what you need is some new friends. I always knew that you had the smarts to get into that ABC program. I always said that if Jonah could go, so can you. 'Cause as smart as Jonah is, you even smarter. - Just ain't gonna give up, are ya? - Don't start with me, man, okay? - You got Jonah's head filled up with all that preppy mess and now you workin' on Ed. - You damn right I am, our boys' lives are gonna be better than ours. - Better? I work my fingers to the bone, and you took all those courses in night school, what's it gotten us? - You quit on life, I gotta live with that, but I'm no quitter, neither are my children! - They my children, too! - Well, then why don't you start actin' like a father? Teach the boys how to be a man and not a quitter! I'm a man! Workin' for 20 years to be Assistant Manager! Watchin' all the white boys come in and take the promotions that were mine! - Please! - I know what it's like to be a black man in a white man's world! Now the more you make this boy expect, the more disappointed he's gonna be, and you know that! - I know that my children deserve a dream and I ain't gonna let nobody stop me from givin' it to 'em! Not those punks who cut up on Eddie's friends, not no white people, and not even their own daddy! Eddie, if Tyree was able to go to private school, you think he'd be lyin' up in that hospital bed now? - This is the beginning of your new lives. You'll study harder than you've ever studied before. You'll be on the line all the time. You drop the ball, you're out of the game. But if you push, and you push hard, you'll make something of yourselves. Go out into the world, make your community proud. Goodnight! You represent the best Harlem has to offer, that's why you're here. If you don't agree with that assessment of yourselves, then you don't belong. You'll be here everyday after school and three hours each weekend until you're ready to take your SSATs. It's not just the knowledge you'll gain in prep school, it's the contacts, you'll be meeting some of the future leaders of this country. The people you meet will be your friends, your study partners, and one day, your business partners. You will be one of them. - Nobody dances like this, not even white people. - Years from now you may find yourself attending a formal at the White House, wining and dining with heads of great nations, and when you take to the dance floor, I'll be smiling down on each and every one of you from Heaven. Keep dancing. All right! All right, Exeter, can you believe that? He's the first boy from this neighborhood ever to go. The first! I knew you could do great things like this! The best school in the country is gettin' my best! All right, all right! Yeah! They better be ready for me, 'cause I'm goin' in there smokin'! - No, prep is not like Wilding, man, everybody's smart there. Sometimes it can blow your mind, they're so rich. - Am I gonna have to deal with a lot of them calling me Nigga and all that? - No, they'll never come at you like ordinary white people, they come out of the side of their mouths with corny little sayin's and play mind games with you. Trying to make you take low to them. - Well, they won't make me take low. - Just last week, I had to deal with a bunch of rich white boys in the locker room at Westminster. They were sayin' things about black people in a nasty way. I know I can't hit, if I do, I just get expelled as one more crazy Nigger, so I swing my fist against the wall. Cracked the cinder block, man, they ain't bothered me since. - Well, you know, none of that's gonna happen to me, Exeter's a better school than the one you go to. I expect my white people to be better than yours. - You just watch yourself up there, Ma's countin' on you. - She's countin' on you, too. - No, Ma, and every one else, they're watchin' me, they're countin' on you. - Eddie, to you, baby. - Congratulations! - Cheers. - Way to go, Eddie. How we doing? - What do you mean, we, white boy? - Hey. So, you're gonna take off? Up to one of them preppers. I don't know. - It's worth it, man, you don't need this crap. - Gonna miss you, though. - No you won't, you gonna come back here talkin' all that white stuff, I know you. - Nah, man, I'm never gonna forget where I come from. - Maybe I get my grades together and come up with you next year? That good? You bet. Well, number on the card matches the number on the door. - Well, you get the bed by the bathroom, it's, last one here, it's a bummer. I'm Barry Harrison. Upper Darby, I'm your Sophomore guide, and you're? - I'm Eddie Perry from New York City. - Well, Eddie Perry from New York City, this is Kyle and, I'm sorry, what was your name? - Sean, Sean Putnam. - Yeah, he's from New York just like you. - Yeah, what part? - Long Island. - That's New York State, that's not the City. Get him, an elitist. Look, curfew's at 10 p.m. unless otherwise posted, no visitors, no excuses. Also, like your handbook says, ties and jackets should be worn at all classes, dinner, lunch and assemblies. Of course, these rules are meant to be broken, so stick with me, I'll show you how. - I stand before you today to offer a unique privilege, an Exeter education. It is up to you to take advantage of that privilege, and to use it for your own betterment. Your membership in this class is a testament to your intelligence and to your character. We build leadership at Exeter, and we expect the best out of you because you are the best America has to offer. - Hi, hi, I'm Eddie Perry. - How you doin', Eddie Perry, I'm Lamar and this is Rachel. - Hi. - Hi, Rachel. - Welcome, welcome to Exeter. We are so glad to have you here, really. Well, thanks. - I think this is gonna be a good experience for you, well, for all of our students it's important to get to know people you wouldn't otherwise meet. - Think it'll be a good experience for us, too. - It's going to be challenging at times, but then, that's what this school is all about. Now, if any one of you needs any tutoring, or any special help, I want you to feel free to come see me. I know what pressures you're under and I just want you to know that my door's always open. I'm on your side. - Thank you. - Believe me, if there are sides here, there ain't no way he's on ours. - Come on, let's get outta here. - Hey, Eddie. Wanna get some lunch? - Sure, I'll see you guys later, okay? - Later, no problem. - You comin'? - I'm comin', I'm comin'. So, where do we sit? - It's the worst question of the year. - How is that? - Well, all school cafeteria's are broken down into clicks, you know, the climbers with the climbers, the grinds with the grinds. - Climbers? - Yeah, the social climbers on campus, you know, the students who are really caught up on being with the in-crowd. Then, of course, you've got your jocks, which are the athletes, and grinds are the guys who get straight-A's on everything. - Back home we call them brainiacs. - Jocks, climbers, grinds, nerds and burn-outs, everybody falls into a category sooner or later. Pick the wrong table on your first day, you could blow your whole academic career. - Didn't think there was that much to rich kids. I always thought they was just, you know, like rich. - So, you're here on scholarship? - Hey, yo, are you tryin' to crack on me on the sly, or what? - I just asked a question. - Do you think scholarships are the only way a black kid can get to a prep school? - You think all white kids don't have problems because they're just, you know, like rich? - How come they never play music we like? - No beat, man, rhythm's all off. - It was the same thing at the private school my cousin went to, nothin' but rock all night long. - See what's up in this place. - Where you goin'? - What's up, Sean? - Bored, man. Man, you should join my friends over there, y'all got a lot in common. Who's that? - Who knows, a prep? - Hang back, hang back. Hello. - Hi. - Punch? - Thanks. - My name is Eddie Perry. - Hi, Allison Conners. - So, you seen much of the school yet? - Yeah, I visited here last year. I didn't have a chance to visit, I just kind of came. - Um, it gets cold early in New Hampshire. Yeah, I like the brisk weather here. Me, too, I like it, too. - You want some more punch? - No, I'm fine. - So, you wanna dance? - Sure. - Okay, okay, um, all right. I'll be right back, okay, don't go anywhere. Lamar, give me that tape. - What? - Come on, lend me the tape. They won't let you play it. Baby, they're gonna play somethin'. Hope y'all enjoyed that one, and now we have a special request from one of our new preps. So wave your hands in the air! We don't care. I said wave your hands in the air! Wave like we don't care. Now, everybody, scream. - I said wave your hands in the air. Wave 'em like I just don't care. - I said wave your hands in the air. Wave like I just don't care. Now everybody scream. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! - And as King Sisyphus spent his lifetime outwitting the gods, only to spend an eternity pushing a boulder up a hill. Now this poor king has implications for us in modern life. Anyone care to venture an analogy? Don't everyone raise their hands at once. - Well, I think it's kinda like building up the arms race, right? Explain further, Miss Conners. - Well, the weapons these Super Powers have they can destroy the world, so everyone's afraid to use them. - You're point being? - They're like the boulder, they serve no useful purpose. - No, wrong, nuclear weapons are a deterrent, Sisyphus' boulder was a punishment. Anyone else? Mr. Perry. - Well, um, I come from Harlem. And down there, you got lots of people that can remind you of Sisyphus. They all got their dreams and schemes, but nothin's ever gonna come of them, you know? It's like they keep pushin' these dreams up a hill but all they ever do is go crashin' back down to the bottom. - Very interesting analogy, Mr. Perry. Go ahead, I'll catch you later. - Hey, Allison. - Hey. What you said in there really made me think. Thanks, thanks. So, do you wanna get somethin' to eat? I'm gonna meet some girlfriends of mine. - Okay, all right, well, maybe next time? - That'd be nice. - Okay. Nice. - Yo, Eddie. Need to talk to you, man. What is it, homeboy? - You need to chill on that white girl, man. - What? - Look, these people may act liberal, but they ain't gonna be so liberal if you start messin' with their girls. - Hey, man, what's between me and Allison is between me and Allison. We're just friends, me and her, okay, so don't come out of no racial bag on me here. - It's just what they expect us to do, man, chase after these white girls! They think that's all we got on our minds! - I'm not in to what other people think, all right, I'm in to what Eddie knows. - All of us who come over here have got to think about what's important, Eddie, priorities! You need to ask yourself if that white girl represents any kind of priority? - Do yourself a favor, Lamar, don't push this. - Ain't nobody here gonna stand up for you, not these white bread teachers, not these white bread students. You better start hanging out with the people from back home or you're gonna find you don't hang out with nobody. - Hey, Eddie, Eddie, gotta talk to ya. Our basketball team last year was 2-12, that's the third worst record in the division. - Humiliation time. - Yeah, no kidding. I think we need some new talent on the court. What do I have to do to talk you into it? - What are you, the team recruiter or somethin'? - No, I mean, I just figured, well, he's from New York so he must be a player. Yeah, yeah, I'm a player all right. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Great, so I mean you'll show us some of those slick city moves, I mean, turn the team around? Well, um, I, yeah. Come on, a little hustle here, come on. Man, this place is big! - Yeah, you should see the hockey rink. Man, man, it's like being on the floor at Madison Square Gardens. Listen, never say Madison Square Gardens, you wanna say Boston Garden. - Let's go guys, a little hustle out there. Come on, drive the ball, come on. - Hey, Coach, it's the guy I was tellin' you about, it's Eddie Perry. - Thanks for comin' out, Mr. Perry, it's good to have you here. It's very good. - Thanks. - I look forward to watchin' you play. Okay, let's do it. Okay, gentlemen, let's see some action. - You okay? - No problem. - Yeah, Barry told me you didn't make the team. - I said, it's no problem. - It's only basketball, Eddie. - I know! I just gotta be on top of things. Basketball or studies. - Okay, all right, you wanna be on top? Let's play some one-on-one. No, come on, I'm serious, let's go. Give me the ball, let's play! - Get outta my face, I'm shootin' baskets. - You get outta my face, come on. Let's go, gimme the ball, give me one shot, one shot. Putnam gets the rebound, dribbles down the court, tryin' to shake his man! But rookie sensation, Eddie Perry's all over him! The shot's up! And the shot is down. - Yeah, play with me and you'll always be number one. - Yeah. You're lucky this time. - You were lucky. - Yeah, okay. It'll be a miracle if I don't fail this exam. - Come on, you'll ace it no sweat. Kyle's in the class, too, and he hasn't even opened a book. - Typical. - No, I don't get it. You know, you come to a school like this, you don't expect to see people who say, "So what," to everything? - Hey, don't make the kids out here to be somethin' they're not, okay. I mean, being smart or rich doesn't really change that much, you know, just kids. Hey, come on, will you guys just give me the book back? - Hey, take it back, yourself. - This is really stupid! What's this, you his boyfriend? I'm his roomie. You mess with him, you mess with me. - Why don't we leave you alone and you can mess with each other? Eddie, stop it, please! - Hey, hey, hey! - Eddie! - Hey, hey, come on! Break it up! That's it, break it up! Stop it! Brinkman, what the hell's goin' on here? What, so why were you punching him? - Me, they were the ones. - Hey, these guys jumped me! - You know, you shouldn't be such a hot head, pal. I mean, preps are always gettin' ragged on. - You're actin' like I started this! - And you're actin' like this campus is some sort of ghetto street corner. - What's that supposed to mean? Hey, Eddie, come on, let's go. - No, no, no, no, I try to stick up for my friend and this guy cracks-wise with some okey-doke remark about Black people? - Hey, I didn't say anything about Blacks. - The hell you didn't. - I was commenting on your behavior, buddy, not your race. Go back to your dorm. - Come on, let's go. Come on. - I don't understand, Sir, I was only trying to help Sean? - No one faults you for that, it's how you went about it. - Well, he was tryin' to get on my race. Eddie, the rules are, people can speak their minds as long as they do so in a civil manner. - So, I gotta stand there like a chump and take this because he's speakin' to me civilized? - You can reply, but only in an equally civilized fashion. That's a rule, Eddie, doesn't matter if you understand it or not. - I understand it when somebody's crackin' on me. - Intemperance is frowned upon here, Eddie. You punch somebody out, for whatever reason, and you will find yourself an outcast. - I'm telling you, I won't let people walk all over me, I won't. - And I'm telling you, as someone who cares about you and about the Better Chance program, watch your step. - Sir, I'm just used to standin' up for my friends. I'm just-- - Just nothing! You listen to me, Eddie, you get Harlem out of your mind because if you don't, you're not gonna make it here at Exeter. You understand? - Great meal, Ma. - Yeah, it was smokin'. - Good meal after church is always in order. Like my mother used to say, "Food for the body." "And food for the soul." It's true! Junior, your brother made honor roll up at Exeter, isn't that somehtin'? - Way to go, Eddie. - I'm expecting you to do the same thing. - I'm doin' all right, Ma. - All right? You're too satisfied, Junior, you're a smart boy but you're too content on coastin' by. - Ma, it ain't that easy for guys like us up there. - I didn't say it was always gonna be easy, but you gotta rise above that, keep your eye on the prize. - You ain't havin' no kind of racial problem are you, Son? - Well-- - What kind of trouble could he be havin' up there, everything is just fine. - Let the boy talk, Veronica. - I don't wanna hear that kinda talk. Now you can find prejudiced people wherever you go, his job is to rise above it and ignore them. You hear me, Eddie, you ignore them. Now you hear me, too, Junior? Prejudice didn't stop Martin Luther King from doin' what he had to do, and it damn sure ain't gonna stop us from doin' what we have to do at prep school. You hear me? - I never put that gleam in her eye, but you do it. - She don't mean to hurt you, man, it's just she pushes so hard. - Seems like I can never do enough for her. - Where we headed, Jonah? I mean, Ma's got all these plans for us and Dad, he just sits and watches. But, where we headed? You and me. - I know it ain't easy up there, Eddie. Ma don't see it but I do, I could ace out too, but why bother? - I try my best up there. - And that's their game. Good grades, good schools, they just turn us into little white boys. They ain't never gonna let us get ahead. - It's just, it's just I'm scared, Jonah. Come on, let's go shoot some hoops. I'll wipe your butt all over the court. All right, come on. - So, I think if I can keep my head in the books enough, I can become a doctor some day. Maybe a lawyer, maybe both. Ambitious. - Yep, I think I'll always be that way, too. - What are you lookin' at? - Well, I was just thinkin' how nice it is to see you. I thought about you a lot over the summer. You think about me, too? Yeah. Well, here we are. - Yeah. - Thanks for walking me. My pleasure, really. - Well, I'll see ya later. - Allison. - Yeah? - Um, good night. Good night. - So, Allison, we can't believe you're still seeing that guy. - I'm sure you can't. - Are your parents freaking out like you're having this total rebellion or something? - It's not exactly a crime. It's not? - Hey, I'm jealous, my parent would totally disown me if I was seeing anyone like that. - Allison, tell us the truth, what's he like? Is it true what they say? - You'll just have to see for yourselves, won't you, girls? Hey, loverboy. - Quit that loverboy stuff, Barry, what are you doin' in the hall anyway, you forget your keys again? - No, come on, somethin's happenin' over at McConnell I want you to check out. - Sean there? - Forget Sean, this isn't for him, come on! Guys, this is the guy me and Kyle were telling you about. Eddie, this is Bobby, that's Joe, Sam and you already know Kyle over there. - Well, you know, it was nice meetin' you guys, but it's almost after curfew and I-- No, no, don't worry about the proctors, they're on our side, and we didn't just bring you here to say hello. - We got, kind of a lose aggregation here. Club, McConnell Club. - Yeah, thought you could be one of us. - I gotta go, see you guys later. - Hey, Eddie, what's up, thought you'd be glad to join us? - Look, you keep that junk outta my face. - Whoa, wait a minute, man. - Get off me, Barry. - What the hell's your problem? - Look, I'm on scholarship and I'm not blowin' it, you understand? - Look, you better relax, man, all right? There's no need to get so uptight. - Next time you push that junk in my face I'll show you just how uptight I can get. - Eddie, I want to be friends, I'm just not sure about, you know? - I don't get it, not sure, not sure about what? I'm scared, all right? - I think if two people care about each other, they, you know, can handle anything. - I don't know what I can handle? I mean, your friends, my friends, it's not that simple. - What are you sayin', Allison? - We need to think about this, be realistic. I don't know that this is right, okay? I just don't know? - Okay, fine, let's just break it off right now, let's just forget the whole thing! - I didn't say I wanted to break anything off! Eddie, I care about you, all I said is that I'm scared and I don't know what to do. - No, I do think you know what you want to do, so fine, we'll break it off right now! Eddie! - You okay? - Yeah, great. - Eddie, what's up? - This room is a mess. - Eddie, come on-- - Just back off, okay! - Okay. - I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I just can't take this place any more. Yeah, yeah, the pressure can really get to you? Yeah, I know what it's like. Come on, Sean, being the only black kid in the class, you know what that's like? Every time somebody's got a question, I gotta answer for the whole Black race. You know what that's like? Watchin' people watch me all the time. Listenin' to people ask stupid questions about what it's like to be Black, you know what it's like? - No one means anything like that. No one means it, but they say it, they think it! - Eddie, I-- - They're always so careful about how they say things around me, they always talk to me different. Nothin' straight, nothin' racist, but always different! I can't even get a haircut in this town! When I first realized that, we laughed, remember? Remember? - Yeah. - It ain't funny anymore, Sean. It ain't funny. - Listen, next year we go abroad, Spain'll be better. It'll be great. - Maybe. Maybe I'm just homesick. - Yeah. - Yeah, maybe. - Como, estas, Amigo? - Hey, deja vu! - Is that Spanish? - No, that's how you two first met, remember? Freshman Dance? - What? - What, Eddie, you've been starin' at her all night, why don't you go say hi? - Not a good idea, man. - Eddie, you look like a sick puppy. Come on, what have you got to lose? - Just my ego. Leave that here with me. I'll give it back when you're done. - Hi. - Hi. - I was-- - It's-- - Go ahead. - No, I'm sorry, you. - I was hopin' I might get a chance to see you, talk with you. - So, you settled in yet? I mean, do you like the family they put you with? - I'm fine. - Good. So, you wanna dance? - Sure. Wave your hands in the air. Come on, like you just don't care. Come on. - I say, wave your hands in the air. And wave 'em like you just don't care. Said somebody scream. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I said, wave your hands in the air. Wave 'em like you just don't care. Now somebody scream. It's so beautiful here. - Real beautiful. - Everything's gonna be different here, maybe we'll be okay? - Things can be whatever we want them to be, Allison, it's up to us. - Yeah, it's up to us. - Well, good night. - I could arrange to have someone drive you home. It's okay, I can get home from here. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. We'll have two of those, Senor. - You will be paying for this, yes? - He can pay for himself, what's your problem? - I have the money, do you want me to pay first? - No, forget that! Does anybody else pay first here? There is no need. - What did you say? - Forget it, Sean he's an idiot. - You don't like what I say you can leave! - Yeah, we don't like what you say and we want an apology. - Look, you can get out, too! - Not until we get an apology from you! - Get out! - Come on, Sean, let's just leave, okay? - I want to see your boss right now! Right now, you little-- I don't believe you! - You okay? - I'm callin' the cops! - Come on, man, you can't call the cops, you just started a bar room brawl. I need some ice. - I hope the guy knocked some sense into your head. - Hey, I was standin' up for you. Hey, weren't you the one that taught me that the only way to get by in the Hood was to hang together? You know, mess with him, mess with me? - I forgot to tell ya about the exception. - What's that? - It the other guy's bigger than you. - I gotta letter from my parents, they're in Paris, they're comin' to visit. - Cool. Don't worry, I'll behave myself. - Eddie, maybe it'd be a good idea if you didn't meet 'em this trip. - What? - You don't know my parents and I don't think you'd want to. - No, no, no, no, they don't want to meet me, right? - Eddie. - What is it with you? Back and forth, back and forth, it's like you got me on a yo-yo. - All I'm asking is that you not meet my parents this trip. - You're askin' me to be a fool. - You think I want it to be this way? It's easy for you to be the injured party here. - I'm the Nigger, I'm the one who gets told he ain't good enough for nothin' white, especially you. I'm the one who's on the outside of everything. - Eddie, I can't be strong. - I can be strong for the both of us, Allison, I just gotta know you're with me? - Eddie, I can't. Eddie? Eddie, wait! Eddie! - Man, this place is nice. - Yeah, we lookin' for a place on Long Island, now. - We're gonna split right after the baby comes. - Hey, y'all got a family and everything, this is deep! - Well, anything's possible when you got money. Excuse me. Eddie, you remember Cynthia, right? - What's up, Eddie, I ain't seen you in a long time. Um, so, you want a girl or a boy? - I don't know, girl? So, how's Hassan? - He's upstate, he got busted on an armed robbery rap. - 10 years, man, first offense and they give a brother 10 years. - 10 years? Wow. - Wow, that's all you can say? Why you got to come back to Harlem anyway? Don't nobody here want to see your Oreo ass! Hell, I was just as smart as you, I got good grades, too. You was lucky, Eddie, it's all it was. You was lucky! - Forget her, man, that's that crack talkin'. - You're givin' it to her! - Hey, man, I'm her friend! I look out for her, she know that! - Ty, I'm gonna go get some dinner. Okay. - See you, Eddie, if you ain't here when I get back. - I'm headed out, too. - Hey, Eddie, you go by Russell's place on the way home, right? - Yeah? - You wanna drop off a package for me? - Package of what? - Maybe I'm askin' you for a favor? - You know I can't do that. - Hey, don't be eye-ballin' me, man! - Why not? - I'm pullin' in $1200 a week! I'm makin' money! See, takin' care of my family! - This ain't right! - Man, you get by your way, I get by mine, okay? - No, not okay. - Don't get me mad, man. - Look, Ty, this is wrong, there's no way you can make this right. - Times have changed, homie, and so have you! Cynthia might be a crack head, but she sure peeped you, brother. You don't belong to Harlem anymore. You a white boy now. You might look Black, you might even talk Black, but you a white boy now. Don't make no moves you can't back up. - I don't know if I want to go back? I don't know if I can hold out? - You can hold out, your grades are terrific. - I know about my grades, Mr. Tolliver. - Listen to me, you have to think of Exeter as a bridge you have to cross, not a cross you have to bear. - It's hard, I mean, it gets so confusing up there. - You can't allow yourself to be confused. You must apply yourself if you want to rise above. - But why me? Why do I rise above? - 'Cause you keep trying, you never give up. - Like Tyree and Cynthia gave up. I don't know anymore, Harlem, Exeter, everywhere I go I get hurt. - Look, I know that the last few years haven't been easy for you. - Then why'd you send me there? - To see to it that you didn't end up like Tyree or Cynthia! To give you a chance to be somebody! - But I was somebody, I was Eddie Perry of 265 West 114th Street! All I am at Exeter is a smart, black kid! I smart, black kid. All I am here is a credit to my race. Gotta do good for my family, do good for my people, do good for my school! Where's Eddie? What about Eddie? - Eddie, it is the same everywhere, Harlem or Exeter, it doesn't matter. - Yes, it does! This was my home! I don't have a home anymore, I don't fit in anywhere now! - Listen to me, the Tyrees of this world are not Harlem, you are Harlem! And you will go back up to Exeter, and you will fit in because other black kids have! - I'm not other black kids, I'm Eddie! - Then act like it, dammit! Be the Eddie who showed us all that energy and promise. Don't come home with your tail between your legs like a whipped dog! Eddie, you've got to pay the cost if you're going to be the boss! Now you can make it! - What the hell do you know about makin' it in that White world? I'm the one who's gotta be up there and deal with that mess so you can sit back and have your fantasy future of Black America! Don't tell me anymore what I gotta do, tell me what I am, tell me who I am! 'Cause I don't know anymore, I don't know? Forget it. - Mr. Perry, you're five minutes past curfew. I'm sorry, I won't let it happen again. - Where were you? - At the library. In the reading room. - Well, you'd better get back to your room, you're late enough as it is. - Okay. - Hello, Anna, yeah this is Lewis Porter, how are you? Listen, was Edmund Perry at the library tonight? No, no problem, just checking. Yeah, thanks, good night. - Why'd you call the library? - Don't let it bother you, Eddie, it's part of my job. - But I told you the truth. - Look, a lot of people say a lot of things to keep from getting in trouble. Eddie, what's going on? Why wouldn't you believe me? Eddie, come on, let's go. - What do I gotta do, man, ain't the scholarship and the honor roll enough for you? What do I gotta do, man? - Eddie, Eddie, let's go, man, let's go. Fine, let's go. Eddie, what are you doing? - I'm transferring to another dorm. - What, what, move to McConnell, join the McConnell Club? Maybe? - The school burnouts, the losers? That the best you can do? - Come on, man. All my mother ever talked about was how different Exeter was from Harlem. This place was paradise to her, you know? Well, Exeter ain't different. Maybe the kids are white and rich instead of black and poor, but ain't nothin' changed. So, all I'm gonna do is hang back, kick loose with some friends and chill. - Friends, what friends, Kyle and the guys from the McConnell Club? - Man, everybody else here's two-faced, why not me, too? This is about Allison, isn't it? This isn't about Exeter? - Sean, you don't know. - Well, fine then, keep it bottled up. - Leave me alone, Sean. - Eddie, why don't you get mad at the people you're supposed to get mad at instead of your friends all the time? I wanna help. Yeah, you wanna help me, Sean? - Yes, dammit! - You wanna help me out? - Yes! - Help Mr. Porter trust me when I tell him the truth. Help Allison see past my black skin! - Race, race, race, everything's race with you, Eddie! See people, why can't you see people? - 'Cause they can't see me! - Well, give them a chance, you know, not all white kids are alike? You know, it's not like we all sit around thinkin' up ways to screw up Eddie Perry's life. We've got lives of our own to screw up. Sean, this has got nothin' to do with you, okay? It's on me this time, it's on me. - I'm gonna get a single room in McConnell. I gotta learn to look out for myself from now on. - Well, that's just great, Eddie. You look out for yourself and I'll look out for myself. We'll be great friends. - I don't need you to judge me on this, Sean. - Right, you don't need anybody for anything. Sorry. - Gentlemen, we spent our Junior year studying abroad, and she was fine! But now we're Seniors, and there's only one way a McConnell Club Senior knows how to battle senior-itis, and that's party. So let's party! Eddie, glad you finally joined. - Well, hell, that's what everybody expected, isn't it? - Yeah, so Eddie, think you can do us a favor? - What's the favor? - Well, next time you go back to Harlem, you think you could score some serious drugs for us? - That's why you wanted me to join your club? To score you drugs? Come on, you're one of us, now. Hey, we got the money. Excuse me. - Hey, yo, my man. - Your man? I need to talk to you. - Hey, Eddie, your fly's open. I can't believe you fell for that one. That's just a joke. - I'm sorry, Barry. Get the hell away from me! Just stay the hell away from us, we don't know you and you don't know us! - Help me! Help me! - Eddie, congratulations, I just spoke with the admissions counselor at Stanford, full scholarship, have a seat. Would you like a sip of sherry? I keep a bottle here and this does merit a celebration. I won't tell anyone if you don't? - Thanks. - We're very proud of you here. And we're not the only ones. You're a credit to your community. Stanford represents a major accomplishment. - Well, call Eddie Perry, he delivers. - Yes, you have delivered here, Eddie. You've done a fine job at this school and you'll do well at Stanford, too. You're part of the Exeter tradition. - What's Stanford like? I mean, should I be preparing? We'll get you a good internship for the summer, something in the business community, probably. Don't worry about preparing for Stanford, you've had the best preparation anyone could want right here. I'm sure you'll find it's not all that different from Exeter. Thanks for the drink. - You have the foundations upon which a worthy life can be constructed. The knowledge you have acquired here at Exeter will gain in value as you apply it to your lives. May your actions from this day forward make each and every one of you a credit, not just to yourselves, but to your family, your academy and your nation. - Really had to push hard for that affirmative action on the Stanford scholarship situation, 'Eddie? - I'm not gonna get into a thing with you, not today. Baby, I'm so proud of you! - I'll be right back. - All right. - I wanted to apologize to you, Sean. I owe you a lot, man. - You don't owe me anything. - You were a friend, I didn't realize how much that meant. We had some crazy times, man. - Yeah, a little too crazy some of the time. Yeah. - Will you write? Stay in touch? You bet. - I just wanted to say-- - It's over now. Another time, another place, maybe things could have been different. - Maybe? - Hey, ain't no two days alike. Wouldn't want them to get the wrong idea. - Eddie! - Bad joke. - Sean, I thought the three of us might take a picture together. - Great, would you take it for us? - Sure. Hey, everybody, get together, smile. So, how's the job? Wall Street's gonna be a trip, man. Private schools' take care of their own, I'll say that. - They do, all right. You know, the only thing harder than going to prep school is coming home from prep school, then you gotta fit in. - Yeah, I know that. And when's it gonna stop, Jonah? This summer on Wall Street, four more years at Stanford, and what about graduate school? It's like it won't go away, it doesn't stop? - It is what it is, you know. The thing is, you're gonna make do with it, take what their offering and walk by the rest. - I can't just walk by the rest, though. - Don't take it so personal, Eddie. Come on, bro, let's play some hoops. - Man, get off me. - You need to blow off a little steam. I need to make me a little money. - It just gets to me sometimes, Jonah. - Get you out. - Come on. - Man, you think you're the hot shot of New Hampshire but you're home now and I own this court, come on! Come on! Yeah! - Hold up, Jonah. You see the way he looked at us? - What way? - Like we was gonna mug him or somethin'. - Come on, Eddie, we gotta go. - You see, that's how they do. - Hey, chill, you're makin' somethin' outta nothin'. - Nothin'? He looks at us and sees two black guys and he figures he's gonna get rolled. Don't ya see, it's just more of the same, man. - Eddie, forget it! - Same suspicious look, same attitude, like I'm gonna do something wrong. - What's your problem? - Eddie, wait. - No, you wait. Ain't nobody gonna make me feel like that in Harlem. They may make me feel like somethin' else at Exeter, but not here. - You're a white boy now. - Hey, yo, what's your problem? - Hey, just mind your own business. - You're in my neighborhood, this is my business. - You get Harlem out of your mind. - What, you come up to our turf, boost whatever you want and who takes the blame, black kids! - Hey, just, just back off. - Back off, you back off you son of a bitch! Eddie, relax, man. - Stop, police officer! - Eddie, he's a cop, he's a PD, let's get outta here! - Help me! Help me! No, no! My baby! Goodbye, Exeter, you taught and showed me many things. Some things I saw I did not like, and some things I learned, I'd rather not know. Nevertheless, it had to be done because I can never learn not to learn. It's a pity we part on less than friendly basis, but we do. Work to adjust yourself in a changing world as will I, signed, Me, Eddie Perry. - Hi, Sean, you okay? - I guess so, you? - I don't know? - I can't get it out of my head. I keep going over and over all the time we spent together, wonderin' what I could have done? - You were his friend, Sean, you were a good friend. - I don't know? All I ever wanted, all anybody ever wanted was what was best for Eddie. - But no one ever asked him what he wanted, did they? I never asked him, Eddie. - It's okay, it's okay. - I just keep thinking that we all could have done something different, something better. - I know. I keep thinkin' that, too.
