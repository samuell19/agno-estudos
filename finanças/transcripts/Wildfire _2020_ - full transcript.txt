This was the deadliest terrorist attack ever in Northern Ireland. Good evening, from Castle Buildings at Stormont outside Belfast on the day of a truly momentous agreement, promising a fundamental change in the relationship between North and South and between Britain and Ireland. Unites Loyalists and Republican, Unionist and Nationalist. So far, more than 300 have been freed early because of the Good Friday Agreement. We are concerned that Brexit has brought about those divisions to the fore again. The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has called on the Government to set out how it intends to avoid a hard border following Brexit. Please prepare your ID cards and passports for inspection. Excuse me, miss? Miss? - Hm-hmm. - Hm. Remove your jacket, please. Have you got something in your hand there? No. Open both hands, please. It's St Christopher. He's not really a saint any more. He wasn't doing enough miracles, so they just got rid of him. He's more likely to hear you. "Less people wrecking his head," as my ma would say. Here you go. Can you remove your shirt? And your top. And your trousers. Can I go now? Kelly, you've come up on our system as missing for the last year. Now, you're not in any trouble or anything. People are concerned. Do you want us to call anyone? Let them know you're OK? - I mean, what about your... - No! I'd like to go, please. Yous can't keep me here. My knife, please. Hey! So... You're back to visit your mamma? Get your washing done? My mum's dead. Shit. It's fine. Years ago. Car crash. I was just a kid. Sorry. We're here. We're at the border. Thanks. Here, I don't even know your name. Christopher. Like the saint. Is Lauren in? Is she here? - Jesus Christ, Kelly. - Can I come in? Is that OK? Yeah, yeah. Come in. Shit. She'll be back soon. You can stay in the spare room if you want. Thanks. I have to get up early in the morning, so... Yeah. - Kelly... - Yeah? She's been through hell. She'll be happy to see you. What's with her always limping? That's a fake leg, you know. - No, it isn't. - Aye. She's had it since she was a wee one. Well, if it's the same leg, it explains the limp. Christ, Ania. If you knew what happened, you wouldn't be laughing. We all knew someone in that bomb. What I'd love to do is run a bubble bath. What I have to do is get the bloody kids out to school. - I'm been dying to get to bed. - Mm. I hear you. Is that your Sean? What's he doing here? Hey. It's OK. She's OK. Kelly's OK. She's at home. She's home. She's at ours. She's OK. Come on. Come on. What happened? I think, erm... I think Kelly's back. Kelly? Kelly? I made you breakfast. I burned it a wee bit. You're not hungry? You said you'd keep in touch. I didn't know where you were. I thought you were dead. No. No. I can see that. When are you leaving? I said when are you leaving? Get out. Get out, Kelly! - No, please, Lauren. - Get out! Please, I don't wanna be on my own. Please, can I just stay? Come here. What you wish for? I'm not telling you. Fine. Hey! Huh. Oh. So we'll say goodbye from another fabulous evening with Radio Shine from our hosts Kelly and Lauren! Kelly and Lauren! Come on. Come on. Let's go to bed. Come on! Come on! Jump on the bed! Come on. - Come on! - Go, Lauren! Whoo-hoo! Can you touch the ceiling? Oh, my God! Do you remember? Her laugh! Is that your mum? When was that? July 2000. July? We did Christmas early that year. - With what? - Decorations, lights, tree. Presents. Even wrapped them. Are you serious? - Mum hid them all over the house. - We were finding them for years. In the summer? - The whole place was lit up. - You could see it for miles. Aunty Veronica nearly did her nut in. Told her to take it all down. Then she painted the house pink. Salmon. It was pink! You never told me this. Well, you don't know everything. - How was your day? - Oh, it was good, yeah. - How was yours? - Yeah, it was good. What do you fancy for dinner? I'm starving. I don't mind. My God, she was never out of this. Get that off, now. Was she wearing that when they found her? Was she? Lauren, was she? She was only trying on the coat. Mum didn't kill herself. Lauren... No one said she did. Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has called on the Government to set out how it intends to avoid a hard border following Brexit. The Committee says time is running out for a technological solution to be found before the UK leaves the EU. You OK, Lauren? Yeah, I'm fine. Lauren? Lauren? Lauren! - You're late. - I know. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Fuck. Here. Hit the bitch with that the next time. Actually, don't. She'd love that. Come here. How's your Kelly? She's great. Where did the police find her? Is she OK? Yeah, she's fine. She came home herself. Shouldn't have worried. Right. - I hear your Kelly's back. - She came home herself, Mary. She's OK. Aw, see? Someone up there was listening. - Where was she? - She back for good? For fuck's sake! I have to go. Is she all right? Hi! Hi! Over there! Hi! - Hello! - Hi! Hi there! Can you hear me? Yes! I was saying to Kelly she is the spit of your mother got. Do you not think so? It's great to see you back. Your sister was worried sick about you, weren't you, Lauren? - Right. See you later, Mary. - See you. Bye. Don't go talking to them, you hear me? You know I'm the same age that mum was when she died? Better take care of her good coat. Yum, yum, yum. Lauren! Oh! You got it on her coat. Here, hold that. - Hey! - Oi! - What the fuck? - You're disgusting! - Kelly! - Fuck you. - Fuck you! - Kelly! Fuck you. Did any of yous get their reg? Your mate started it! She's fucking nuts. Quit that! I'm warning you! Delete it. Lauren... Lauren, leave it. Come on. Lauren. What are you doing? Nobody will see us. Come on. Oh, Lauren. Come on. One, two, three! Come on! Come on! They should have kept it pink. Imagine she was home right now. She'd be smoking the head off herself. Van Morrison blasting. Dancing away. I'm in the north. I'm in the south. I'm in the south. - I'm in the north. - I'm in the north. I'm in the south. I'm in the south. - I'm in the north. - I'm in the south. Couldn't get us out of here. Even when we got sunburnt and I got all those freckles on my back. We got heatstroke. - No, we didn't. - We did. Veronica called the doctor. Where was Mum? Exactly. Come on, Kelly. Aunt Veronica... Oh, God. Where have you been? Hm? Have you nothing to say for yourself? She's only just back. Come on. I'll heat up your lasagne. Have you any idea what you put us through? Do you? Veronica... She took to the bed. Lost her job. We were worried sick. - If only for Sean... - That's enough! Let's head inside. Have some dinner. No, I'm away to bed. Why did you say that to her? - Someone needed to. - Screaming in her face? We wanna keep her here, for Christ's sake! - Good night. - Night. Mm. Kelly... what are you doing? - Kelly? - Jeez... Jeez, Lauren! - It's five in the morning. - Yeah. It's good, isn't it? It opens the place up, doesn't it? We could put spinach, lettuce, chives. Rosemary. Mum loved that, didn't she? Kelly, just stop! Stop it. Why? Why? It's just... I know it's shit now, but I'm in the middle of it. Lauren, please. I'm good at this. I am, aren't I? Please. Please. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. OK. But put the fence back. Lauren? This is gonna be the best fucking garden you've ever seen. Right... There you go. Do wolves still exist? What, in the world? No, here. No, you mad thing. Why didn't you wake me? I'm gonna be late. Oh, shit! What the fuck? Growing vegetables. This is our home, Lauren. - Not one of her bloody squats. - It'll give her something to do. What, and the whole street something to talk about? Are you mad? There's enough of that already. Either you tell her to put it back or I will. Kelly, I want that lawn back before we're home. Lauren, come on. We won! - Hi. - Hi. - See over there? - Yeah. Right now we're in the north and over there is south. If you go there and do this... Watch. Ready? Yeah. - You can be in two countries at once. - No, you can't. - No way. - You can. - Really? - Yeah. - Where is the line? - It's invisible. If it's invisible, you can't see it. Just cos you can't see it doesn't mean it's not real. - See that house over there? - Yeah. That house used to be pink. Crazy woman lived there. - Say she killed herself. - Yeah. - Did you order the sausage rolls? - Mm-hmm. - And the wee mini-burgers? - I did. Was she wearing this when she died? Was she, Veronica? I found that in her pocket. What is it? I don't know. Did you read it? Will you read it, please? - - Kelly, just sit... sit down. Just read it. Will you read it? Everyone knows it was a car accident. The police said so. Read it, then! Read it then, please! Just read it, will you? I don't want to. Please, just read it. It's a shopping list. For fuck's sake, Kelly. Why would you do that? I took yous in when your mother died. I looked after yous. She's quick to forget that. - I just need to know. - Kelly, go to bed. - No. - Kelly, go to bed! She's every reel of your mother got. She's away with the fairies. Just shut up! Lauren. Lauren, this has turned into a madhouse. She's staying here. Did I say she couldn't? I know what you meant. Lauren? - Lauren! - What? Lauren, love, you forgot your high vis. Sorry. Is everything all right? Yeah, it's fine. ...75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90! - - Wow! Whoo! - Can I try? - I want a go. I'll teach you how to hold your breath properly. Let me go first! Come on. Grab it. Help him. She scared me. - It's OK, it's OK. - Wait, I didn't mean to. She's a weirdo. Stay away from her. I'm telling on you. What's so funny? Oh, it's just a stupid Facebook video. Let me see. - Quit that! - She's fucking nuts. Delete it. Delete it. Yous all have a good laugh? He punched her in the face. It's fucking hilarious, isn't it? - You broke it. - Sorry. You did that on purpose. - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you fucking did. You're right, Mary. She's crazy like her mother. - Lauren! Lauren! - And you... You shut your mouth! You hear me? Hi. Can I help you? There used to be a black market here every Sunday after Mass. - You know that? - No. Yeah. One Sunday a car bomb blew everyone to bits. Sorry. I had no idea. How were you to know? They tell you fucking nothing around here. I'm here to see Lauren Cassidy. She's my sister. I need to ask her something. It's important, OK? Are you OK? They send you to spy on me? No, your sister's outside. Kelly! Kelly, you all right? What happened? Am I a weirdo? Are you serious? Am I, Lauren? You got me out of work for that? Don't. Come on, come on. You're soaking. You're not a weirdo. It's this fucking town. - You hear me? - Yeah. OK. All right, girls! That's enough of that. - Come on! - Come on. That's three times already. Can I buy you ladies a drink each? Yeah. You want something stronger? No. - Sure? - Yeah. Yous twins? No! Guess who's older, me or her? Bet you're older. The size of that belly on you. That's all muscle, love. Muscleman, see if you can do this. Watch. Lauren, hold my legs. Yeah! - Can't be doing that in here, girls. - Why not? - What harm is she doing? - Cut it out or get out. Sure, they've done far worse and you still serve them. - Yeah, far worse. - You should go on now, girls. We haven't done anything wrong. Someone shut that fucking hyena up. You don't know who you're dealing with. Yeah, I do. 12th of July '92. Busy day for you, wasn't it, Gerry? My ma told me what you did. Our dad was one of the 26 your bomb killed. She doesn't even remember him. And you lot got early release to keep the peace. You might be a free man, Gerry, but you're still a murderer. Am I? Am I? Am I? You don't scare me, mister. What are you going to do? What are you going to do, huh? - Get those fuckers out of here! - That's it. - Get the fuck... - Bye-bye, girls. Come on, Gerry! Fuck you, Gerry! Come on! She gave this to me the day before she died. Was dad's. She loved that. Here. You have it. Go on, please. Close your eyes. Go on. Just do it. All right. Breathe in. Remember the smell? - Burnt coconut. - Mmm. Hmm. And the heat. Everyone asleep but us. Mum taking photos. "This place is hell," she said. With those murderers free, I'll never be at peace. Mum started it, didn't she? Lauren! Shit. Lauren! She's getting worse. You want her ending up like your mum? What are you on about? Veronica told me. I know about the week she died. She stole Veronica's car and went on the run with it. On the run? Jesus! She borrowed it. She was taking us on holiday. Spur of the moment. Do you hear yourself? She stole a car. She took yous out of school. No one heard from yous. - The police were looking for yous. - She just needed a break. From here. From everyone. And those dicks walking around free like they'd done nothing wrong. When they killed our dad. She painted "murderers" outside a pub with IRA men drinking inside. She was a danger. Put you kids at risk. Veronica wanted to get her help. Veronica's such a shit-stirrer. Me and Veronica want Kelly to see someone next week. No. There's nothing wrong with her. Hold on. - Kelly? - Yeah? It's Veronica's 50th. Here's money to get your hair done for the party tonight. Thanks. If you leave, you'll kill her this time. Lauren? Lauren. Lauren! Leave that. Come with me. You haven't been reaching any of the targets. - That's because they're unreasonable. - No, they're not. There have also been some complaints that your behaviour has been unusual and it's starting to make people feel uncomfortable. Who? Who said that? Lauren, we all seen what happened in the canteen. Did you see what they were laughing at? You know what? I'd rather shit on my hands and clap than work here! Now, if you could just... Your face looks familiar. Are you from around here? Yeah. I probably know your mummy. What's her name? Anna Cassidy. Oh, my God. Anna Cassidy. Was she your mummy? Yeah. Car crash, wasn't it? Hit a wall? And just her in the car, too. Oh, God love her. Awful sad leaving two wee girls behind like that. Such a waste. Such a glamorous woman she was, too. You'd never without the red lipstick. She was like something out of the films. Do you know what's mad? You are the image of her. I have to go. - OK. - Sorry. I have to leave. - Are you OK? - Yeah, fine. Here. Take this. Thank you. - Oh, hey, no. That's too much. - It's fine. Don't worry. Is she OK, Veronica? Hello? Hello? Come on, guys. Let's go to bed. Come on, come on. Bed time, bed time. No! Snug up. Get in under the sheets. Come on. Oh, my God. Your feet are freezing! Oh, your feet are so cold. I love you. I love you so much, my darlings. Take it, Kelly. And look after your sister. Marty! Marty! There's someone in the house! Marty! Where? Come back here! Come back here! I left my job today. What do you mean you left your job today? I'm not going back. Jesus Christ, Lauren. Hey. - Where the fuck have you been? - Sean. You've got five minutes. - What happened to your hair? - I changed my mind. You know what, I'll be waiting in the car. Your drinks. Veronica, there's nothing wrong with Kelly. She won't be seeing anyone. You hear me? You going behind my back? You are making a scene. Oh, Sheila, John... Lauren, we're not talking about this here in front of everyone. Fuck! Can I get another? You all right? Don't mind them. Hey, you! Stay away from my kids. Do you hear me? Marty. She's a psycho. Nearly drowned my son. - What? - I didn't hurt him. - You broke into our house. - That's our house. Tell them, Lauren. I should call the police. - Don't. She's not herself. Then fucking do something! Or I will. What are you looking at? Stop looking. Stop looking. What were you thinking? Stop looking. - Lauren, please. - Answer me. - Just leave her alone! She's a danger, just like your mother. I knew this would happen. She tried to have our mum taken away, now Kelly? Your mother wasn't fit to look after yous. God knows what she'd have done next. She killed herself. That's what she done. - I wanna walk. - Kelly, get in the car, now. Get in, please. She's seeing someone. Tomorrow. - Go the other way. - No, this way is faster. - Open up. Open it up. - Open the door! - No. - Open it! - Let me out! - No! - Open it now! - Kelly, I'm sorry! I can't! Open them now! Lauren? Lauren? Let me out! - Kelly... - Open the door! - Open the door! - She's gonna hurt herself! - Open it! - Open it! - Open it! - Open the door! - Lauren, she needs to... - Open the door! - Open the door! - Open it! OK! OK! Come on! Lauren, look after your sister. What is your name? - Don't get up! Stay down! Stay down! Kelly! - Kelly! - Stay still. Kelly! It'll not be long now. - Ring Lauren! - Get in the car! Kelly! Lauren! Kelly, get in the car! Breathe, breathe, breathe, Kelly. - - Breathe. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Where are we going? Where are we going? Shh, shh. Hey. It's OK, it's OK. it's OK, it's OK. Lauren. Kelly? Kelly? She drove us here that time. We'd fallen asleep and when I woke up she was over there. Looking down. Was ages before she got back in. And then she put the car into first. I don't remember if we said anything. But I put my hand on top of hers. Together we put it into reverse. We drove for ages before you woke. She took us to the garage to get ice creams. Would she have killed us? I think that's why she left us at the garage. Do you think she loved us? Lauren... It's her. See? She loved us. She did. She did. The best she could.
