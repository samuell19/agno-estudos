Look, I am quite sick and tired. I've been listening to your baloney excuses, and confirming the next destination for weeks now. I've been breathing the same air for hundreds or maybe thousands of years. Even the smell of this room that used to comfort me is now making me sick. You asked for this sir. This room is the exact replica of the original. Everything, even the dust particles on the books, is the same as it was once on earth. Though I can change the room if that's your wish. -It does not matter! How long has it been? 100 years? 1000 years? You've shown me 55 habitable planets Robot! 55! Some of those planets were even better than Earth itself! But you keep saying damp air this, short daytime that. Isn't there a single suitable planet in the whole wide galaxy? We cannot know that until we examine every possibility, sir. We must keep looking. I'd rather have a miserable life down there on that planet, than spend one more second in this room. As long as your health is at risk, I don't have to obey your orders. I must decline your request. Health is more than just a functioning body, Robot. Believe you me. We're losing time. We should begin our journey for 56th alternative. Do you confirm, sir? Do I have an another option? Do you confirm, sir? Yes. Yes, I do, yes. Yes, I confirm. Hello, sir. This planet is almost perfect. It has all the basic conditions for life. Yes? Some of the atmospheric values aren't exactly how they should be. Although it may seem harmless in the short run, the long term effects might be different. That's okay! That's okay, that doesn't matter at all. What's the worse that could happen? I'll just die a little sooner. That's okay. Come on, Robot. I'm ready. Come on. Do you confirm the journey to the 57th alternative? Instead of accepting death like everyone else, I'm lost in this infinite darkness. Which is worse? I don't know. We have to move on. Do you confirm the journey to the 57th alternative, sir? No. No. No, I do not. I don't, Robot! You are dropping me off on this planet, and we're ending this right now! I'm sorry, sir; I cannot obey an order that will harm you. We have hundreds of planets ahead of us, sir. I'm sure one of them will be just perfect. No. This won't work. This won't work like this. Do you know what we should do, Robot? I'll give you the confirmation to travel to the next planet. Oh, yes. In fact, I confirm the journey after that, as well. Since you won't like that one either, I'll even confirm the journey after that one, too. And you won't like that either, so I confirm the one after that. You just go and wander around the whole galaxy, and wake me up when you find the planet of your dreams, all right? Neither of us will waste the effort that way. Do you think that's possible? Thank you for placing your trust in me, sir. I hope this will be your last sleep. Hello sir. Our mission is complete. Is that so? Where is this planet? There are no such planets sir. No? How's that? I've traveled to all the habitable planets in the galaxy and inspected them. But none of them have the required conditions. You wandered around the whole galaxy, and among all these planets couldn't find one single planet that is similar to earth? To be honest... even earth was inadequate for my standards, sir. Well, I used to live there! But you had to escape for your life. Take me to the best among these planets, Robot! Whatever comes, I'll welcome it. Look. This ship was designed to supply your every need. I can provide every service you need, until the end of your life. Are you serious? I would rather die. I don't want to spend one more second in this room, Robot. Find me some place, Robot! Find me some place! That place is here sir. We must keep going and gather resources to keep the ship running. We are no longer searching for a planet, therefore a shorter trip-- -Everything in this room... and I mean everything, is the same as my home, isn't it? Yes, sir. Even the dust particles among the books-- I think you've failed robot. I shouldn't have let this happen. But that is your decision. I cannot intervene. This won't change anything, anyway. Futhermore, I wanted you to understand this. I think you'll now understand how well I can take care of you in this ship. This is just a temporary precaution, don't worry. Your real body is safe. If you have calmed down, I'd like to get your approval, and resume our journey. I'm trying to die in a rescue ship. Go, figure. I wish I stayed on Earth like the others and… Look here, Robot. Was the Earth among the planets you examined? No. I rescued you from there in the first place. Look, too much time has passed since we left Earth. Who knows how it is right now? There is always something left. Life always flourishes again. Sir, there is no better place for you than here… Have you seen the Earth? How would you know? Let's go and see what became of it. You were talking about journeys, here's a journey for you! Next planet, Earth! As you wish, sir. Next planet: Earth. Do you confirm the journey? I must repeat that this ship is the most suitable place for you, sir. Tell me, was I right or not? Is there anybody? A small group. Told you! Told you! And what do they look like? They are the same kind as you, sir. Humans? Sir, the conditions are still inadequate. Robot! Right there, right now, people are living there. Your mission was to find a habitable place, wasn't it? And now you've got it! What else do you want? Now restore my body, and set me free. Right now! I'm sorry sir, I can't follow that order. Ouch! Look at this! Oh, it's awful, awful! You have to fix me now. Yes, sir. Or, let's not waste the effort, huh? Just give me a brand new body. It'd be my pleasure, sir. And leave this old one to Earth. It won't harm anyone. Yes, sir. I'm sorry for everything you have lost. It's over now. Now, we must keep our last promise to you, and find you a new home. We are embarking on a very long journey. Take one last look at Earth. I'll be your friend until we find day and night again. Now... Do you confirm the journey to the first alternative?
