MY FATHER THE HERO. I brought you some croissants. I'm going to be late again. Did V?ro call? Isabelle? It's me. I've just read your letter. You could've told me to my face. It's cruel. I never thought you were just a passing phase. Couldn't we have talked it through before you decided? I'm late as usual. I'll call you when I get there. Lots of love. I miss you. Isabelle? Yes, I heard the horn. I'm on my way. - Hello - Hi - Is she ready? - You kidding? - Hurry! Dad's here. - We're late already! Calm down, good dog. That's enough. - He's pissed on me. - He wants you to pet him. - We'll miss the plane! - I'm coming. - Mum, I'm taking your jacket. - What? No way! - Good dog. - Are you listening? - Out of the way! - Remember what you did to my skirt? - Stuff your jacket, then! - Don't talk to me like that. - Get out of my room. - See how she treats me? She's 14! V?ro, I don't like you speaking to your mother like that. - One day, I'll leave this dump! - Good idea! - Go and live with your dad! - Keep your hair on, it's a dump anyway! Don't come back until you've apologized. - Apologise. - I hate her. - She's sorry. - Who asked you? I'm warning you, I'm serious. The same goes for you. V?ro! You didn't give Mummy a kiss! That's right, good dog. - Call as soon as you get there. - OK. Take your dog and give me my daughter. - Promise? - Yes, Mum. - Take my jacket. - No, keep it. - Just for me. - No. Take the jacket. We can go now. Bye! - Welcome to Mauritius. - Hi. - This place's full of old people. - There are lots of youngsters. - Oh, yeah? Where? - They're young, aren't they? Awful! - He's not too bad, is he? - I know his type. - Acting cool 'cause his dad's rich. - You're hard to please. - Here we are. - Mine's the rum punch. Andr?! - You don't mind? 'Dad' is so dumb. - Yeah, it's dumb. What do you think? I bought it specially. - It's totally indecent. - It's sexy. - I want you to meet someone. - Not with the hat? - She's really nice. - I just want a quiet time. Come and say hello. He's shy. Christelle... And this is my father. Sit there. - How do you do? - Hello. - What do you think? - He seems very nice. - Thanks. - Not bad for his age. - Just needs to lose weight. - Charming. - Want to join them? - I was clubbing till 5 a.m. - Really? - Wanna burn off your love handles? - Thank you, but no. - Too bad. I'm going. Her mother isn't here? We're divorced. Who's he? A musician at the hotel, called Pablo. He's funny. - You scared him. - Obviously very shy. - Did he chat you up? - We were talking, that's all. He's playing at a private party on his next night off. - He invited me, nice eh? - Very nice. - We can go after dinner. - I can't go with my dad! - Exactly. You're not going. - Why not? - You're not dating him. - It's not dating. - I said no. - It's because he's black, isn't it? I'm not racist. You're 14 years old. - 14 and a half. - The guy's a layabout. - Probably takes drugs too. - Drugs, of course! - He only invited me to a party! - Where are you going? For a walk. Do you mind? - Is the lounger free? - Yes, I think so. Hot, isn't it? Think of the weather back home! - Alone? - Yes. - Aren't you scared? - Of what? This is a magic place. Can't you feel it? - Spirits live in these ruins. - I'm not scared of spirits. That's good. You're brave. But don't stay out late. Night falls quickly in the tropics. - Your parents 'll be worried. - I'm too old for that now. I'm sorry. May I ask how old you are? - 18. I'm not with my parents. - Friends? Not with friends, either. - What's that? - Coral. Can I see? It's beautiful. - What do you do for a living? - It's a question I often ask myself. - Your coral. - It's for you. A present. Thanks. - Alright? - Fine. - And you? - I'm fine. - Walk normally. - I am. You're acting like you're on a catwalk. Sexy. I didn't think you'd be with such an old guy. - I thought you were just a kid. - Benjamin? Benjamin? What are you doing? Are you coming? - Will you be at the ruins tomorrow? - I don't know. Maybe. - Benjamin. - Yes. What's this? - You're suddenly very affectionate. - Don't you want me to be? - How are you two lovebirds? - Good evening. - Stay for a drink? - I'd love to. - But I'm going to bed early tonight. - What a pity. V?ro. Come and see. - What is it, Andr?? - The moon. - What's wrong with it? - It's rising. - Really? - Are you coming? It's wonderful. Yeah. Hurry, sweetie. What's the rush? The moon's not going anywhere. Come and see the goddamned moon! It'll be back in a minute. You can tell me all about it. What's up? Hello, I'm not in but you can... - What are you doing? - Looking at the moon. I'm going to sleep. Is that you? - Is this your chalet? - Where are you going? - Home. - Aren't you at the hotel? I help out during the summer to earn some money. My parents have a house along the beach. I'm not sleepy. Fancy a walk? If you like. - Do you live in Mauritius? - My parents do. I live in Paris with my grandma. Is he sleeping? Yeah. - He's old enough to be your dad. - I know. Actually, he pretends to be my dad when we travel. I'm not really 18. I'm 14 and a half. I'm under-age. It's dangerous for him. They're looking for me. - Who? - The police. I left home. - You're on the run? - Yes. He picked me up hitch-hiking. I liked him straight away. I was homeless, taking drugs. He got me out of all that. Without him, I don't know what would have happened. - What does he do for a living? - International business. - Does it shock you? - None of my business. - You're too young to understand. - And you...?! With the life I've had, I've grown up quickly. V?ro? My daughter and I would like to go water skiing. - Benjamin, V?ro. - Hi. - Hi. - Who's going first? - You go. - Me? - Any problems? - No, but he's the jealous type. What are you doing? You're going too fast! - The old creep! - Slow down! - Let's teach him a lesson! - He's not a creep. - He's taking advantage of you. - You've got it all wrong! You don't know him. He's a great guy! - If you knew what he can do... - What can he do? You can't imagine. He's an adventurer. He was a gold-prospector, a smuggler, a mercenary in Africa. - Is that it? - No... Look! - You're crazy! - Adventurers like taking risks. Look out! - Slow down! - OK. - You're not funny. - You said slow down, so I did. - 14. It's disgusting. - She doesn't even realise. She's had it tough. Her mum's crazy and her dad walked out. Poor kid. He's no good as an instructor but he seems nice. - You could be friends. - No way, I can't stand guys like him. Oh great, is she still here? Some faces look good under the lights, others don't. I've got a good eye. I've been in this job a long time. I'm her father. - How do you do? - Patrick, Andr?. - She's very beautiful. - I know. - A juice for mademoiselle. - Allow me. Say thanks to granddad. Put it on my account. - What did he do wrong? - I just don't like him. - He's a photographer. - Ah, just what we need! He says I could make a fortune as a model. Great news. Plenty of boys around and who do you pick? A drugged-up singer and a phoney photographer. - You're a pain. - Yes, I'm a pain. Stop it! You're pissing me off. Leave me alone! I had to try, didn't I? Was it very wrong of me? No? - Then I'll try again. - Enough! - Tell me what I'm doing wrong. - It's not my job to teach you. - You like old guys. - I don't like jerks. - Don't call me that! - Let me go. What are you going to do now? You're in my power. Go on, silly little girl. Silly girl! OK, we'll stop. Let's forget about it. So why did you come here then? Does he know you're here? Does he know? Silly girl! Nice walk, sweetie? - It's nice here. Lots of youngsters. - I don't know anyone. Why not make friends? Want me to try? You think I can't? Just you wait. Like to have a drink with us? - Stop it. - Forget it. Sorry. - Have fun. - I don't like it. - Let's dance. - I don't want to. - Come on! - No! You're no fun. I'm going to dance. - I need to talk to you. - Are you kidding? - Two minutes. - Leave me alone. Thank you. - Do you like dancing? - I love it. I dance in front of the mirror for hours on end. - You're teasing me. - Not at all. - Can I borrow him? - I'm not sure. - As long as you give him back. - I promise. - I could have got rid of her myself. - She's nice. - Silly girl! - Did you hear that? - Someone shouting. - Silly girl! - I can't hear what he's saying. - Neither can I. What a night. It's paradise, isn't it? Isn't the Southern Cross beautiful? It's the brightest star. - Do you like Mauritius, sweetie? - Yeah, it's not bad. - Not bad? Honestly! - What's the matter? - At 14 I'd never been out of Paris! - OK, calm down! Some kids can't even afford the public swimming pool! - I know. - You didn't even look at the stars. I did look, dad! Come here! - Are you crazy or what? - Completely bonkers. - Don't do that again. - Then talk to me. - We've said all there is to say. - No. I'm sorry about yesterday afternoon. I behaved like an idiot. - If he'd seen you... - I don't care. - He's a dangerous man. - He doesn't scare me. - Will you come to the ruins later? - What for? - I want to see you. - What about your girlfriend? - It's over. - Since when? Last night. - Will you come? - You'll see. Since the failure of Marxism, the north-south axis is paramount. If we don't help the south develop, there'll be a return to fascism. The triumph of capitalism will have been in vain. - Events in the eastern block... - A friend for you. - Julien, V?ro. - Hello. You're studying at Moli?re. What's it like? - It's OK. - I'm in my final year at school. It's tough but I want to fast-track into politics after I go to college. - I'm going to dive right in. - Good idea! Listen, think of it this way... ...financial and economic problems... ...an institution with some political power, or a major financial organization like the IMF, or OPEC, for example. - Not going for a dip? - Later. - What sports do you like? - Horse-riding mostly. - I'm sports mad. - I'm thirsty. I'm going to the bar. Want anything? - A coke. - I'll come with you. As a result, we're slowly but surely returning to gunboat diplomacy. Just look at the Falklands War... We over-estimate their capacity for recovery. Apart from Hungary and Czechoslovakia, maybe. And the rise of nationalism, together with border disputes... If you're on the run, how come you can travel abroad? He got me a false passport. - He's strange. - I think so too. There's so much mystery in his life, I wonder if it's all a front. - A front? - Yes, he works undercover. - Smuggling? - He's not the type. Probably information, like a secret agent. - You're crazy to stay with him. - Maybe, but it's exciting. What about you? - Tell me about you. - I'm in my final year at school. - But it's all a front. - Really? - I'm really just a waster. - V?ro! Evening, Madame. Can we have the bill? - You like Isabelle, don't you? - She's OK. - She likes you a lot. - When are you getting married? I have to ask her first. And she might say no. Yeah, right. Wouldn't you like to have a little brother or sister? Why not? It's time I moved on. And you'll soon be flying the nest. Your own life, a boyfriend, no more holidays with your old dad. Why don't you pay so we can go? - Waiter? - Yes, sir. I'll pay at the desk. - Thank you. - Goodbye. What's the matter? - What did that creep do to you? - I hate him. What happened? Can't you tell me? Is it because of me? - Have you seen my daughter? - You have a daughter? - You've seen us a dozen times. - She's your daughter? - I haven't seen her. - Thank you. - It's not his daughter. - Didn't you know? - I'm looking for V?ro. - I'll come with you. - No! - But... Are you crazy? Let me go. What's wrong with you? - Where's Pablo? - I don't know. - Where is he? - He took a girl home. You're off your head! Don't move. - Who is it? - It's me. Excuse me. Sorry. I made a mistake. - Want a lift back? - No, thanks. - You haven't seen my daughter? - You should ask Benjamin. Who? - Leave him. - I can't. - Why not? - He'd never let me. - I'll keep you hidden. - He'll find me. I know him. I've got an idea. Come and see. My dad's yacht. I'll steal it and we'll hide on that island. - You're mad. - I've always wanted to. I know the islands inside out. I spent my whole childhood here. What will we live on? I'll go fishing. We'll find a deserted creek to anchor in. We'll live like savages. Would you really do that? You don't believe me? We'll leave tonight. We'll go once my parents are asleep. - Benjamin... - Before dawn. Listen to me. - I understand. - No, you don't. I'll get you away from that creep. I have to tell you something. It's not an easy thing to say. It's him! I'm sure it is! - What are you doing? - Stay there. - Wait! - Keep out of sight. Sorry to bother you so late. - Is Benjamin there? - Who's this? - The boyfriend. - Of that little girl? He's seen me. If it turns nasty, call the cops. - The cops? What do you mean? - I'll explain. I'm sorry to bother you. - Have you seen V?ro? - What do you want with her? - Haven't you hurt her enough? - Leave it alone. She doesn't want to see you. - Keep away. - Wait. - Stay here, please. - I'll explain. I won't let you go with that creep. We'll call the cops. - Not the cops. Let me go. - Have you quite finished? - V?ro! - Calm down. - Let me go! - Be quiet. - If you lay a hand on her...! - Be quiet. The whole family's crazy. Are you going to tell me what all that was about? Have you been seeing that boy in secret? - Pack your things. - What? We'll take the first plane. You're going to your mother's. I was about to call the police. What have I ever done to you? Out of the way. I slogged my guts out to take you on the holiday of a lifetime. Am I not allowed to start over? I have to live alone forever? Why? - I have a selfish, jealous daughter - You don't love me! What? V?ro! Wait! You don't love me any more! You're crazy! What are you saying? You're going to marry Isabelle and have children. I'll come and visit like I was a stranger. I won't be your daughter any more! Will you be quiet? I love you. - You're my little girl. - Leave me alone. Come here. How can you say such things? Nobody's more precious to me. You'll always come first. You're my little princess, my baby. My little girl. - Better? - Yes. Why were you seeing that boy in secret? - I told him you weren't my father. - What's all this nonsense? - Who was I supposed to be then? - A friend. - A friend? - Yes. Doesn't he think it's weird at my age? No. - It's normal for us to share a chalet? - He thinks it's disgusting. - He thinks we're together. - Together? - A couple. - What? - Why do you invent such stories? - I don't know. - Lies make life more interesting. - And then some! He'll think I was making fun of him. - If he loves you, he'll forgive you. - I know him, he's proud. - You have to talk to him. - I tried. It's not easy. In the meantime, can't you just pretend? Pretend? Are you crazy? - What's it to you? - I said no. Do you love him? I like having a daughter but sometimes it'd be easier if you were a boy. - He's here. - Who? - Benjamin's coming. - What? - What does he want? - To speak to you, I suppose. - I'm going. - He's seen you. What are you doing? Don't abandon me. Please don't say I'm your daughter, I'm begging you. What can I tell him? Yes, come in. - Is V?ro here? - She's out. Good. I have to talk to you. You don't scare me. - Pity. Have a seat. - I know everything. - Did V?ro tell you? - Yes. - Do you ever think of her feelings? - Sometimes. You think this is normal for a girl her age? Look at yourself in a mirror. You could be her father. You're harsh. Would you mind? Are you trying to ruin her life? She went through hell as a child, with a mother who's half crazy. - And as for her father... - Him! - It's gone far enough. - I agree. - I've decided... - Yes? She'll stay with us till the end of the holiday. My parents agree. - You can see her from time to time. - Very generous. Then, she'll return to Paris with me. She should go back to her mother. - You think so? - Yes. It will be hard, but I'll be there to help her. - And what happens to me? - You disappear from her life. - Forever. - Really? What makes you think I'll give my... er... V?ro up so easily? Because of what she's told me about you. I think that deep down, you're a decent guy. Thanks. And you love her in your own way. You're very perceptive. And you? Do you love her? In your own way? Yes. - You're asking a lot from me. - I know. Can't she stay here? You'll see her as much as you like. - Impossible, sorry. - I see. It's too sordid. I couldn't stand it. Alright. I suppose she's agreed? - You've spoken to her? - Not yet. You didn't think to ask? - Shouldn't you ask her opinion? - Of course. Sit down. She won't be long. Talk to her. I'll respect her decision. After all this upset, I need a swim. Good morning. I think you're great. You're mean. I had to wait half an hour. That'll teach you. So? He went out and I pretended to come in. - How did it go? - We talked. He changed his mind about you. He's agreed. - To what? - That I stay here with you. That's nice. He's not jealous? I said it was over between us because of your illness. - Illness? - Promise you won't be angry? - What now? - Promise. I'll promise nothing. I told him you were very ill. I can't leave you because you don't have long to live. You've got an incurable disease. Crazy. My daughter is completely crazy. I'm not going to stay in bed for the rest of the holiday. You can lead a normal life but I must be with you. - He understands perfectly. - Completely crazy. - What's my incurable disease? - A virus. - You don't mean... - No dad, it's very rare. I said I couldn't remember the name. A tropical disease you caught on one of your adventures. - One of my adventures? - Promise you won't be angry? - I'll get really angry in a minute. - Calm down dad. - What did you tell him? - It was before. - I said you were an adventurer. - Adventurer? I said you'd been a gold-prospector, a smuggler, a mercenary in Africa. - Is that it? - No. A secret agent too, but I said I wasn't sure. You take me for an idiot? - I know what's going on. - What's wrong? He's not sick, he's a picture of health. Just say you want to stay with him. What are we playing at here? You think I'd invent a story like that? - Listen... - You haven't got a clue. Go back to your girlfriend and grow up! The pig! He doesn't believe you're ill. - He called me a liar. - You? - Yes. - What a nerve. Sit up a bit. That's better, isn't it? You still look really healthy. Sorry, I'm doing my best. Be warned, I'm not doing this forever. Just tonight. Don't talk about it. He doesn't know you know that he knows. - I get it. - You're just a bit tired. Watch out. Don't overdo it. You're tough. I see. Benjamin? Come in. - Evening. - Hello. - Are you alright? - It's nothing. An old wound that brings back memories. Is it serious? A bullet from a Kalashnikov perforated my intestine. A witchdoctor operated but it didn't heal. I crossed 300 km of jungle to get back to base. But I was young. Those were good old days. - Memories! - Well, see you later, honey. Why not have dinner with Andr? and meet me later? Not at all. I've ordered a nice noodle soup. I'll watch a bit of TV and have a very good evening. - Off you go. - Shall we go, then? Just a second. - What's this about an old wound? - Your lies are catching. - Isn't an incurable disease enough? - Alright. An old wound, on top of everything. It's an excuse to avoid talking about his illness. It's just a flare-up. He'll feel better tomorrow. Poor guy. He's going to die and you leave him to have dinner alone in his room. Sorry, but that seems cruel. Hello, I'm not in but you can... - Come in. - Hello. V?ro said you were unwell so I've come to see how you are. You look terrible. Can I do anything? Within reason of course! Yes. Leave me in peace. Stop harassing me! It's ridiculous! I can't even spend a quiet evening in front of the TV. I'm sorry, I'm talking rubbish. My nerves are on edge. Forgive me. I don't believe this. Christelle! Christelle, wait for me! - Come on, Christelle! - Let me go! - Let go of me! - Calm down! That's enough. Calm down. Everyone's looking at us. Forgive me. - It's crazy to get so worked up. - I can't take any more. Stop owing- Is it really that bad? I'm single. I'm 35 years old. I run a clothes shop in a small provincial town. I think that's explanation enough. No, that's fine. - One last drink? - No, thanks. - Are you sure? - I'm having an early night. Last night, I was clubbing till 4 a.m.. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Will you be alright? He keeps asking about you. He's obsessed. - This is stupid, you have to tell him. - I know, but I can't. At least if something happened between us... - What do you mean, between you? - We haven't even kissed yet. - We're not out of the woods yet. - He wasn't like this at first. - I think you're inhibiting him. - Me? He's scared he won't live up to you. - That's understandable. - He's less confident than he seems. - What would you do? - That's hard to say. When I go outwith a boy, he's usually all over me. OK... Sorry. Have you tried twisting your ankle? You're walking in the moonlight, you twist your ankle and fall into his arms. - That won't work. - Let me think. Or pin him against a wall and kiss him. I thought of that, but it might scare him off. - We're in big trouble. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. - Benjamin came to say hello. - He's teaching me to play poker. - Could you bring us two beers? - Good idea. - Draw. - Draw. I'll stick. And I'll go all in. I'll call you. Four aces. You've all the luck! - Sorry. - Don't worry. - It just slipped out. - You didn't mean it. I'm really sorry. - Will that be all? - Yes. - Would it kill to say thank you? - Thanks, sweetie. OK, cut. It's crazy. He told me more amazing stories. What a life he's had. - He's incredible. - What else did you tell him? - Just a couple of things. - You said you'd stop. I can't. Once you start lying, it's hard to stop. You're giving him a complex. Why ask him to come riding? - I thought it would be nice. - So you can show off? - Sorry? - I know what you're up to. - Up to? - You're jealous, like all fathers. You've got some cheek! Goddamn it! After everything I've done to...! - I've no boots, just trainers. - That's fine. - I've only had two or three lessons. - Let's go. - What's up? - He's jealous. Sometimes he just can't help it. You can't imagine. Poor guy. - He won't canter. - You're pulling on the reins. Go on! He's usually quite fiery. What's wrong with him now? Don't wait! You go on! Come on. - You'd better get down. - It'll be OK, don't worry. Come on. OK. - Pull the sail up slowly. - What? Let it find the wind before you take hold of the wishbone. Wishbone. OK, here we go... Pull the sail up slowly. You'll see, it'll take the direction of the wind. OK... Pull it up slowly... Slowly. Come on. Benjamin! - And then take hold of the wishbone. - Benjamin! Come here! Got it! Was that OK? Did I make a fool of myself? - What's up? - His father had a go at him. - He'd told him to stop seeing us. - What a mess we're in. - He's confiscated his surfboard. - I've had enough. - You must speak to him tonight. - OK! - You've something to tell me? - Promise you won't be angry? - Why? Are you going to make me angry? - Yes. Possibly, anyway. - Is it something serious? - Yes and no. - You're not very... - Promise? OK. - So? - I'm working up to it. That's beautiful. It's one of Chopin's nocturnes. Hang on... It must be him. Come on. He plays piano, too? He studied at the Conservatoire. I love it when he plays this piece. Benjamin! Is it from him? Tell me. 'You love him, it's obvious. I think I've known it all along. It's best for all of us if I stop seeing you. Later, perhaps... '..after Andr?'s death.' Wait... Give it here. - The things you make me do! - You don't have to. I can't let you out alone at this time of night, can I? That's enough! Calm down. Quiet! What's wrong with him? Be quiet! Sit! I have to talk to you! I've something very important to tell you. - Won't you try? - Why ask me? Put more emotion into it. - Tell him you love him. - Are you crazy? - Say 'Benjamin, it's you I love'. - That's dumb. Do what I say! 'Benjamin, it's you I love.' Go on. It's you I love. - I don't believe you. - He doesn't believe me. - Try again. - What can I say? I don't know. Say, 'I swear it's the truth'. - I swear it's the truth. - 'I've never felt like this before.' - I've never felt like this before. - Stop it. - It's not working. - He's a tough one. Benjamin? - Who are you talking to? - No one. - What are you doing? - Getting some air, OK? It's no use. I made a fool of myself for nothing. We did what we could. When his dad's asleep he'll meet me at the gazebo. - Gazebo? - Young people go there at night. - It's one in the morning. - Leave me and go back to the hotel. Where is this gazebo? - What am I doing here? - They're in love, just fooling around. - What's he playing at? - Waiting until his parents are asleep. Here he is. - Stop! - What's going on? - Papers. - The cops. - I don't believe it. - We're not doing anything wrong. Philippe... Deal with these two. - Papers, please. - Is it illegal to park here? It's illegal to sell or take drugs. - You too. - I don't have them. - I've told you a hundred times! - How old are you, miss? - 14 and a half. - I'm her father. Inspector! There's a weirdo here with an under-age girl. Thank you. You should apologise. We woke up the hotel manager. - Sorry. - That's no place for a girl her age. You've a funny way of bringing up a child. Come on. - Benjamin's dad will be furious. - Don't mention that boy again. Are you angry? - Andr?... - Stop calling me that! Hello, I'm not in but you can leave a message after the tone. She's sitting by the phone. She's playing with you, you know. - Nonsense. - You guys are all the same. It's the only way to get you to budge. You're slow to catch on! She'd decided to marry you before you even asked her out. Go to sleep. - Night-night, sweetie-pie. - Night, Andr?. Goodnight. Hey, you. - Leave my son alone, you hear? - But... - Do you hear me? - It's a misunderstanding. Whatever you do with that girl, leave my son out of it. I won't tell you again. It's a disgrace! This is a family hotel. Pervert! Why not pick on someone your own age? What did you say? Repeat what you said. - Let me go! - That's my husband, you brute! - Somebody do something! - I'll see to him. - I'm waiting, you halfwit. - Have you quite finished? Just give me a second. Get some help! Monsieur! V?ro's in trouble. - She's surfing too far from shore. - I told her not to go out alone. She's being pushed onto the rocks. The launch won't start! I'll swim out! I'd been waving for half an hour. No one saw me. - What happened? - I had no strength left. The wind pushed me towards the rocks. I was scared. What's wrong with him? Where is he? I can't see him. He's drowned! daddy! There! Slow down! - Daddy! - Keep calm. He'll save him. Watch out! Quickly! Your father's out of danger. Don't worry. Everything OK? Don't worry, he's strong. He'll be on his feet tomorrow. - ...hit my staff! - I'm just out of hospital! My barman is still in hospital, thanks to you... They're chucking us out. 'I don't know if we'll see each other again, brackets, that depends on you, but I want you to know that, 'know' with a 'k', comma... ...whatever happens, comma, I will never forget you. Full stop.' - That's cheesy. - I can't take any more. We've spent four hours on this already, come on 'full stop, lots of love.' - Lots? - OK. 'Love, comma, your V?ro'. - Your? - Your. Yes, your. Your. Y-o-u-r. And you sign 'V?ro'. - Wait, let me re-read it! - Absolutely not! I've never had such a hard time writing a love letter. What's the matter, sweetie? It'll all be OK, I promise. Look at me. It's New Year's Eve. Those idiots aren't going to ruin our lives. We'll show them what we're made of. Go and get dolled up. I'll put this letter in their post-box. I'm warning you, you've got exactly 90 minutes to get ready. Not one hour more. - Please... - I paid for this in advance. Kindly give us a table or I'll tear your hotel apart. - Please... - My father's in the secret service. Would you like fireworks before midnight? Here's an advance on the tip you'll get if all goes well. Follow me. The champagne. Thank you. Send us a waiter, we're starving. To us... United against the world. Waiter! - Allow me. - Wait. One, two, three... Waiter, please! Serve them. And now, a big round of applause for Pablo and his band. I think you're fantastic! You too. Let the party continue! Dad? He's here. He wants to speak to me. See? I was right, wasn't I? Go on, off you go. - May I? - Of course, take a seat. - You dare be seen with the pariah? - Exactly. I never believed a word of what people said. They're idiots. Anyone can see that you're a wonderful father to V?ro. That's the nicest thing I've heard in ages. - People love to look down on others. - For that, you deserve some champagne. I've something to say too. I think you're adorable and very attractive. If I wasn't already in love with a woman in Paris, I'd have fallen for you. - You're making fun of me. - Look at me. Do I look like I'm making fun of you? - I've no luck. - That will change. Let's drink to the man you're bound to meet very soon. Well, I wish he would hurry up, whoever he is. It's crazy. Why do you make up such stories? I don't know. I like lying. It makes life more interesting. You can say that again! Do you forgive me? - Promise you won't lie to me again. - OK. Swear you'll always tell me the truth. Raise your right hand and say, 'I swear'. I swear. It's midnight. We should kiss. Yes. Daddy! He must be looking for me everywhere. Let's wish him Happy New Year. Andr?! Happy New Year! - B?n?dicte's studying politics. - Happy New Year! - Have you seen V?ro? - She and Benjamin left a while ago. Well, I'll go for a walk. I think you've got better things to do. - Happy New Year. - Bye. - What's wrong? - You ask me that? I looked for you all night. Where were you? - I came back but you'd left. - I was worried sick. We came by but you weren't here. I got changed. - You got the note at the desk? - No. What did you do? We looked everywhere. I hung around in dodgy bars all night, that's what. I'm sorry. Did you really look for me? We looked everywhere, I swear. Forgive me. I was very angry. Happy New Year, dad. Happy New Year, sweetie. So everything got sorted out? Yes. He even kissed me. At last! We got there in the end. It's time we went to bed. I've something to tell you. Promise you won't be angry. Promise? Benjamin and his parents are going sailing for a few days. They've asked me to go with them, just four days. - Until the end of the holidays? - Yeah. - When do they go? - Right now. They said they'd call you. Take your passport. You're not angry? No. I'll just take a couple of things. - Sure you're not angry? - No. Off you go. You're a brilliant dad. Yeah, that's right. - Hello? - Andr?? Isabelle. Where were you? With friends in Normandy. I just got back. - I've been phoning all the time. - I know. I got your messages. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year, darling. - Is V?ro OK? - She's fine. She's gone away for a few days. Your voice sounds odd. Are you OK? I'm OK. Not too bad. - I'll explain later. - What's going on? Is there anything I can do to help? Yes. What? Marry me. - Is that all? - No. Have a baby with me. You're very demanding this year! - Anything else? - Yes. Try and make it a girl. K's OK And even if it's not OK It's OK After all And why... ...are you looking at me like that? I'm not angry with you I know you love me Daughters... ...and their dads... It's a funny kind of love To our daughters, Noura, Fanny, Julie, Andr?a, Constance, Julia.
