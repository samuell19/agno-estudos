Not your right, my right. What? No? No. That's what I'm doing. We have the same right. This is impossible. You have to start at the plugin, silly. You do know that we can buy trees with lights already on them, right? Where's the fun in that? Mum, where are Nani's ornaments? Well, I thought it would be interesting to try a new theme for the tree this year. Everything candy cane striped. -Okay, but... -Calm down. We've had them since we were kids. Calm down, Mira. They are here. Woah, Woah, Mom. You have to let Mira know about changes six months in advance. Don't tease your sister, beta. Mira... I learned a long time ago never argue with your mother when she's feeling inspired. Why do we have to decorate on Thanksgiving anyway? I mean we could be doing literally anything else. Like watching football. You don't watch football. Nani always decorated at Thanksgiving every year because everything gets busy after that. Come on Manisha. You know that Christmas is fruitcake's time to shine. Not that shiny these days. Don't say such things. You must honor the sanctity of fruitcake. You know, if they don't go virtual we could start selling them as eco-friendly bricks. Biodegradable yet impossible to destroy. Our fruitcakes are deliciously tender and light. There she goes. And the very reason you have that sweater upon your back. You know, I actually got this from the mall. Mom and Dad started Varma Fruitcakes with nothing but a dream and our Nani's Kerala Christmas Cake. Actually, there's something we want to tell you. Mira? It's true. Business has been slower the last couple of years. But your mother and I have a plan. Mm-hmm. What plan? We've hired a top tier consulting company to handle this year's holiday advertising campaign. What? Who? We always do our own ad campaigns. Phillips Woolsey Consulting. Hmm. Change it to a blue dress. Blue elicits emotional trust from shoppers. Good morning, Dad. Morning Brady. Can I interest you in a peppermint latte? My assistant swears it'll put you right into a holiday mood, but I'm not so sure. I think I'll pass. It tastes like somebody accidentally put toothpaste in my coffee. I don't know, I think they're sort of festive. Okay. The Christmas madness has begun. And amen to that. All those people down there, scurrying about to buy presents. It's the season we love the most, because what do we say, my son? Christmas is the ultimate ad campaign. Your grandfather coined that phrase and it has made us the number one consulting firm in the world. And speaking of Christmas, pass me that folder. That one. I have... thank you. A project for you. Varma Fruitcakes. Mm-hmm. Never heard of them. You will. Mom. I have looked up Phillips Woolsey, and I just don't know. How can we afford this? Don't worry. Trevor Phillips is an old friend of your father's from college. I have never heard Dad say anything about him. Well you don't know everything about us. We could be criminals living a double life. Mom, I'm being serious. We have money in the emergency fund. Is this an emergency? Sweetheart, people don't appreciate fruitcake the way they used to. Things will pick up by Christmas. Think. What did Nani always used to say? Beti, we think it's time to try something new. I have new ideas. We could do in-store tastings in all the local markets. We can dress Manisha up like a reindeer. Daddy and I would never want to leave you kids with a sinking ship. Mom, it is not a sinking ship. That's why we've hired Daddy's friend. And if this doesn't work, then you need to understand that we might have to make some hard decisions about the future of Varma Fruitcakes. You would consider shutting down? Try not to worry, beti. Trevor Phillips is the best of the best. Okay. I love you Mom. Fruitcake? They're a small regional family-run company. In the era of 3D printed gingerbread houses, fruity doorstops isn't exactly a hot holiday commodity. I admit they're not our usual client. But Avi Varma is an old friend and I'd like to help him. It's a little late to launch a holiday campaign for this year. Although we could plant seeds for next season. They are struggling, Brady. I don't know if they're going to have another holiday season if they don't see some growth. Is that cold business heart of yours turning into a marshmallow? They're paying customers. And it might be a feather in our cap if we can sell the unsellable. Okay. Not marshmallow. Maybe nougat, the sticky kind that ruins your dental work. I've had Finn book your hotel. You'll both leave first thing in the morning. All right. Varma Fruitcakes. It's time you become the most coveted of holiday treats. I told Manisha to have them ship everything to the back entrance. Hey, can I have somebody please move all these boxes? Woah! Gotcha. -Thanks. -Yeah. Um, all of the shipping and receiving should be processed at the back entrance. Safety reasons. I'm not the delivery man. Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you a customer? Let me help you. Sorry about all the boxes. What are you doing here? Working. Uh, you're never here this early and I didn't even hear you leave the house. Uh, I'm the special projects manager, and well, this is a special project. Where'd you get these ribbons? Oh, this is a joke, right? I gave them to her, and it's not a joke. Okay. Who are you and what is going on? Brady Phillips. Phillips Woolsey Consulting. And this is my associate, Finn Webber. I thought your name was Trevor. That's my father. You can think of me as a special projects manager too. Well, I know that you're new around here, but Varma Cakes are wrapped in red and green ribbon. It's tradition. Well these particular cakes are part of a small batch limited edition run. We're marketing them in conjunction with this year's annual color tone holiday hues. It's super on trend. Okay. Well, if you want to hold onto that idea for just a few minutes, you know, I'm going to run it past my father. He's the boss. Well, feel free to speak to Avinash. But your parents have given Finn and I carte Blanche over the new campaign. We have to rush to get them to market on time. Oh. Well, all the same I do think he should know what you're planning before we make any final decisions, right? Standard procedure. I trust Brady. He doesn't like to brag or anything but he's singlehandedly responsible for scrunchies coming back in style. Oh. Not sure they should have. Thank you, I will look this over. Excuse me. Okay for real, scrunchies? We need to keep going. Dad, morning. Have you seen what that man is doing with our bows? Tying the knot? Hot pink? Really? Manisha said these are the cool new colors according to social media. Oh, so now this is some kind of fashion show? I don't think this Brady guy knows anything about fruitcake. Yeah, but what is there to know, beti? Flour, sugar, eggs. Well, these are his ideas. This guy isn't even wearing a shirt. It's shameless. Do you have his number? Dad. Lookit, I mean, if I had abs like that, which I obviously don't, I wouldn't wear a shirt either. Dad. I don't think he knows anything about us, or Nani, or the company. I think you guys should've talked to me about this first. The reason we didn't tell you sooner is we didn't want you to worry. It's our job to worry. It's your job to teach him everything there is to know about fruitcake. Fine. I'm taking it to senior management. Oh no! Go right ahead and tell her that I love her more than I did the day I married her. Mom. So, you've already met Brady. Mm-hmm. Isn't he handsome? No. Mom, focus. Did you tell Brady that he could use those ugly Easter ribbons on our beautiful Christmas cakes? Glad you're taking it so well. Your father was afraid you might overreact. I'm not overreacting. Ah! There you are. Brady, our Mira knows everything there is to know about Varma Fruitcakes. Oh. Beti, why don't you give Brady the full tour? I'm looking forward to learning more. Okay. Well, um, after you. Oh no, no. I insist. Did you see the way he looked at her? Okay, there is hope. Our store front. You're familiar. Okay, so Mira... Um, do you prefer Beti or Mira? Mira. Beti means daughter. Oh. It's like a term of endearment. Well, it's very rural. Mm-hmm. Is this your only location? Yes. This is our only storefront. My parents bought this farm back when they started the company. But it works out just fine for us. Most of our foot traffic is only seasonal. But we do bake, pack, and ship from here as well. And online sales? Jay handles our website. And my father believes in talking to our customers, so a lot of our sales are done over the phone. Good morning, I'll be right there. This is where the real magic happens. Good morning. Delia, your niece made me the most beautiful thank you card. It's so cute. She drew us holding hands and eating fruitcake. Well she said she got the best report in the whole first grade. Aww. But that might be because she handed out cake. Oh, this is Mr. Phillips. He'll be around for the next few weeks. He's working on a new Christmas marketing campaign. Nice to meet you. You too. Varma Fruitcakes are handmade using my Nani's 100-year-old recipe. Hmm, a treasured family secret. And although it's considered fruitcake in the United States, it's actually a traditional plum cake from Kerala in India. That's good to know. You know it lends the brand unique character. Every batch contains a special blend of spices. What's in this spice blend? Only three people have ever had that information. My Nani, my mother, and now me. And it's going to stay that way. Until I have my own son or daughter. Shall we continue? Mm-hmm. You see, what makes Varma Fruitcakes so special is that it's steeped in tradition. A good ad campaign can make a customer think that something new is already an old tradition it won't be Christmas without. You can't fake tradition. Hmm... Would you like a coffee? Oh, always. Nothing can be a tradition until it's shared with someone special. And you can't get that from a billboard. I beg to differ. Okay. Um, why don't you tell me about one of your family's Christmas traditions? When I was a little boy, my mother would come sit on my bed- Mmmhmm. -and read The Night Before Christmas to me every Christmas Eve. Okay, that's what I'm talking about. And then we would drink a cup of hot cocoa and watch for Santa. I always fell asleep before I finished mine. So sweet. And then on Christmas morning, my empty cup of cocoa would be there beside the tree with a note from Santa thanking me for saving some cocoa for him. You wouldn't have that tradition if your mother hadn't shared it with you, and that is what makes it so special. So you like that story? Yes. That's exactly the kind of thing that I want you to think about when you're creating our ad campaign. Real traditions. Huh. What? Well that "real tradition" is an ad I wrote for Huey Cocoa last year. They went from being sold in discount chains to being the top selling cocoa in the US in one holiday season. You know, not everything can be measured in dollars and cents. Oh, there's nothing wrong with pulling heartstrings to bump ad sales. As my grandfather always said, "Christmas is the ultimate ad campaign." Wow. Should embroider that on a stocking. No, no, I'm not a Grinch. But it's my job to look at Christmas as a business. Right. Well, that's the tour. Um, do you have any other questions? I think I've got what I need for today. Great, I will walk you out. This is very generous of you. You have to eat the fruitcake to sell the fruitcake, right? Woah, hey, oh! Sorry. No, it's all good. Wow, Jay. Are you going to have any left to sell? Well you can never be too generous with fruitcake. I was just explaining some of Brady's idea for the campaign. Mm. And they sound great. I mean, who knew there were so many amazing ways to sell fruitcake? Yeah. Brady is full of it. Ideas. He is really just full of ideas. Well, Finn and I will be back tomorrow to go over the rest of the pitches. Hmm. Great, and I'll be here. Well, no rush. Um, little brother. You and I have our own work to do. You know, I really like Finn. But for the money Mom and Dad are spending, you'd think they'd have sent a fuller fully seasoned team. Oh, he seems smart and Brady does too. You just don't like change. I can change. I'm like a liquid. A flowing, morphing, chemical reaction of change. Uh-huh. You know, I bought a new kind of pen for the office the other day, and you sent a company-wide memo regarding the importance of office supply continuity. Can I help it if I'm passionate about ink quality? Come on, Mira. Just give him a chance. Look, you might be surprised. All right. Brady, I've been meaning to talk to you about something. Shoot. I've been your junior associate for two years. Hm. And I... I think I'm ready to take on some more responsibilities. Okay. And I'd like to do that with the Varma Fruitcakes account. Yeah, I don't think... I need to get some of my own ideas to the table if I'm ever going to be considered for full Account Associate. We just don't have a lot of time. And my Dad has this sort of special connection with this client. But I totally understand, and I promise we'll come back to this in the new year. All right? Sure. Yeah, I understand. Great. Let's go. This is Christmas. Okay. This is coffee. Am I playing the game right, or? I'm not playing a game. It's Brady. He is super-hot by the way. Manisha, focus. This is research. We need to convince Brady that his ad campaign is totally wrong. Yeah, who is the other person in this "we" we're talking about? Because I like his ideas. You like this atrocity? Yes! I talked about these shades in my latest fashion vlog. Did you not watch it? Not yet. I've just been really busy. Well, it's not my fault that you're going to shame the Varma name by ending up on the worst dressed list. That is not the point. The point is we need to do something to make Brady understand what a real Varma Christmas is all about. The way that Nani did it. Otherwise, how is he going to know how to sell our cakes? And you're going to do that with our old Christmas crafts? No. I have written a list. Yep. Brady has no idea what he's in for. It's a really good list. Mm-hmm. So I have a proposal for you. Oh, this sounds serious. It is. Varma Fruitcakes is a family company that believes in the heart of the holiday season. So you've told me. And while you may know market trends and demographics, I know Christmas. Is this about that story I told you? I wasn't trying to trick you. I just wanted to prove a point. Well, you know what I think? Have a seat. I think my dad reached out to your father, because as a fellow family businessman he would understand the importance of tradition. Hmm. But instead we got you. I'm the top partner at our firm. I'm trying to say that I think you're just not the right person to market Varma Fruitcakes. Oh, hang on a second. Yet. You're not the right person yet. I think you just need a crash course in my Nani's holiday spirit. Why am I slightly afraid? My parents have agreed to make me your point of contact. And before I give final approval on anything to do with the ad campaign, I need to know that you fully understand a Varma Christmas. Do you know how much research my company has done into the psyche of the holiday consumer? You don't need to be a Varma to sell someone a fruitcake. You know, we're paying you your ridiculous hourly rate. Wow. So what difference does it make if you just do my kind of research? I think you're wasting your money. But it's yours to waste, so fine. What do I have to do? Be at my parents' house today at 3:00 PM. Are there any other clues? Wear something you can climb in. What have I gotten myself into? Seriously, all those ideas you told me about are great. You should talk to Brady. Brady is a good boss, but he's really serious about what he does and that doesn't leave a lot of room for collaboration. Can't hurt to try, right? I'm saving up my best ideas for when I run my own campaign. I just need Brady to see that I'm ready. Well, I get it. Nobody around here takes me seriously. That doesn't seem fair. You know, it's not like I spent my childhood dreaming about creating a website for fruitcakes. My family just expected me to work here so, uh, so I did. Oh jeez, prepping papers. What would you do if you could be anything you wanted to be? I think I'd be a coach. Like PE? With the shorts and the whistle? No, definitely not shorts. Um, I was on the youth Olympic snowboarding team. Wow, did you get a medal? I didn't get to compete. I had a pretty major wipe out on a trial run. I broke more bones in my body than I ever knew a person had. Anyway, that was the end of my professional snowboarding career. I'm sorry. That's okay. My parents never considered it a real career anyway. I bet you're incredible. Thanks. All right. Back to fruitcakes. Uh... this way, candy canes, right? Woah. Have we been drafted into a garage sale? Haven't you hung Christmas lights before? I think my mom usually hired somebody to do it. And I live in a high rise now. I mean, I guess if I wanted to I could put some out on the balcony. That's not exactly the same thing. Oh, hang on. Hi Dad. You'll never guess who I'm having dinner with tonight. Did you finally lock in a meeting with the real Santa Claus? Almost as good. I am wining and dining Mr. Hardy Everett, CEO of Origin Electric. But they've been with Ginsberg Advertising for 50 years. And I intend to convince them to make a change. Now that would make for a very merry Christmas. Guys? Seriously? Are you at a demolition site? Actually I'm doing some important market research. Well then, by all means carry on. And tell Avi I say hello next time you see him. Will do. Thanks Dad. Bye. -Hey. -Hey. Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you. I was just checking to see if your home insurance includes a provision for draining the entire pacific seaboard of electricity. -Where is it? -It's behind the chair. There is no plug behind the chair. It is behind the chair, that's where we plugged it in last year. Brady, I'm so glad you came. We can always use an extra pair of hands. Oh yes. Hey, just happy to help. Oh, and Dad says hi. I'm going to tell him that I'm going to put you to work. Hard manual labor. Mira, why don't the two of you go help Tim with the decorating on the side. Okay? Yes, yes. Go, go, go. Okay? Okay, now enough procrastinating. Here, take this. Put it over there, put it over there. Okay. We have to go get that box inside. Come on. Okay, then don't procrastinate and go get the box inside. So who's Tim? His family runs the farm where we get all our dried fruits. We've known them forever. So more like a cousin or a brother, really? Sort of? ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride. ♪ Around the corner! We can hear you. ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh. ♪ -Hey. -Hey. Brady, this is Tim Bradshaw. Tim, Brady Phillips. -It's good to meet you. -Good to meet you. Mira told me you're going to revolutionize the way people think about fruitcake. I appreciate her confidence in me. Well, we do have to make him an honorary Varma first. Well then. Brady, grab these berries. There you go. Watch out. And uh, they go up there. Oh. Yeah, I think I have this bum knee, you know, lacrosse injury. High school. You know how it is. Yeah. Are you afraid of heights? No, no, no. Don't you work in a skyscraper? Yeah well, those have elevators and walls. They got walls. They do. I'm going to go up the ladder. -Okay. -Okay. Careful. So uh, you've known Mira a long time? Yeah, we've been close for years now. She's a pretty amazing woman. A force to be reckoned with. Well, she's a Varma. They don't do anything halfway. I can hear you, you know. Tim, can you grab me a set of lights? Lights around the corner. Sorry, Brady. Hey, hey, hey. There's lights right here. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. You know, my family decorates. Hmm? We usually stick to the white lights. Just white lights? Isn't that kind of boring? Oh, hey, hey, hey. That's my family tradition you're talking about there. Oh. This is high. Oh! -Woah. -Woah! Gotcha. You okay? Well, you'll never get anything done with your arms full of Mira. Uh... Come on you two. As per Nani's tradition, you will be paid for your decorating services in fruitcake. Dig in. I have a confession to make. What? I don't actually like fruitcake. I mean I know Jay gave us all those samples and everything, but I haven't actually tried any yet. Okay. Set aside any preconceived notions you have, and open your mind and your mouth. Come on, open wide. Ah. Mmhmm. Mmm. This is delicious. I know. So light and airy. I told you. Nani's fruitcake is the best. Fruitcake's just boring to most people. It's what your great aunt would serve with afternoon tea. It sounds cozy. Sounds like a snooze-fest. We need to make Varma Fruitcake seem sexy. Desirable. Aspirational. Exactly. I love fruitcake more than just about anyone, but even I know no one's going to aspire to it. Well that's what they said about kale, and look at it now. Woah, Woah, Woah, wait, wait. Are you telling us that you are personally responsible for the fame and fortune of kale? Well I don't want to brag, but yes. Okay, but nobody's putting fruitcake in a smoothie anytime soon, are they? It's actually a good idea. We could come at it from the health angle. Talk about the fiber and the fact that your fruit is all organic. Yeah, play it up with the yoga set. Exactly. What does any of this have to do with Christmas? Christmas will be the window dressing for everything. Remember, Christmas is the ultimate... Ad campaign. I think somebody needs another project to get him back on the Varma track. Ooh. Watch out, Brady. She is relentless when she's trying to prove a point. Yeah, right. You don't have to walk me to the car. Oh, come on. It's my pleasure. Hey, you going to be at the factory tomorrow? Bright and early. All right. Well, can I take you to lunch? I'd really like that. Thanks for tonight. I had a really good time. You're welcome. Um, drive safe. It's a little icy out there. Will do. I got you some fruitcake. Thank you. Somebody's got a Christmas crush. I'm... I'm just being friendly. You know it's okay to like him, right? I don't like him. He's a coworker. Mira's got a boyfriend, she's a smoochy smoocher. Stop it! I'm going to go help mom in the kitchen. Mira's getting married, it's a Christmas love story. Wow, well I will let you in on a little secret. He makes great French toast. Thank you. Bye bye. -Good morning. -Good morning. So, did you get any inspiration from last night? Some. But I don't think I've landed on the exact right thing yet. Hmm. Well maybe project number two of Operation Varma Christmas will be the thing. Hey, does this one involve ladders? I promise I will keep your feet firmly planted on the ground this time. Deal. When and where? My place tonight after work, and bring a hot glue gun if you have one. Well I'm certain I do not have one. That's fine. We can share. Excuse me. Okay. I've got work too. Varma Fruitcakes. Stop being nervous. It makes you look weird. Why would I be nervous? I don't know, maybe because you have a crush on Brady. Wait, what are you doing? Uh, putting on my scarf. It's winter outside and I don't want to get frostbite. But you can't leave. Why not? Because then I'll be alone with Brady. Okay, I don't think he's a thief or a murderer, so you will be just fine. That is not what I mean. Hey, you know, if he does get fresh with you, you could use the fruitcake as a weapon. No, but seriously, I have been using them as dumbbells for my workouts. It's amazing. Do you ever stop? You know I love you, and you know I love fruitcake. Now go have fun and don't be a weirdo. Did you forget your keys again? I told you to always... put them in your purse. You are not Manisha. Sorry to disappoint. She was just here. She's always forgetting her keys and she was just here, so... Should I go look for her? Hey, I thought you didn't have a glue gun. Oh. Well now I can't say that anymore, can I? Can I come in? Oh, yes. Sorry. Entrée. So this is our project. Looks complicated. Don't worry. It's really fun. When we got to a certain age in our family, everybody got to make their own stocking. Hey, I was seven when I made this okay? I can see that. Don't judge. It was made with love, just like Nani's-. Fruitcake. Oh. You've been listening. Mm. I like that. I'm not that much of a crafty person. All you need is an idea, okay? Maybe you start with a character. Like who would you want to meet the most? -Santa Claus? -Hm? -Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer? -Hm? Uh... Frosty the Snowman? I did always like that Frosty song. Okay. That is perfect. All right. Okay. I would get so excited to hang my stocking up every year. Did your family do Christmas stockings? We had stockings. But they were mostly only for... for show. Santa didn't bring you any stocking stuffers? Oh no. Santa brought plenty of candy to the Phillips' house. But they were mostly in my mother's antique crystal dishes. Hmm. It wasn't tragic or anything. No, I had lots of great Christmas memories. Yeah? My parents would hold these amazing holiday parties for all of their business clients. And I used to love going to the studio with my dad when he was overseeing Christmas ads. Okay. But that sounds like business. Where was the magic? I promise I am not scarred by my kind of Christmas. Oh, oh, okay. I'm not. Okay. -All right. -Yeah. See, you'll have this forever. And every year you can hang it up, you'll remember this moment. And think of you. Oh, no. That's... that's not what I meant. I meant you'll think of Christmas and traditions and snow... persons. Not me. I think I'll have a hard time forgetting you. It's Tim. I should... You should get that. -get that. -Yeah. I should be going home anyways, and, you know, put this inspiration to good use. Hey, can you hang on a sec? See you soon? Yeah. See ya. Are you checking on me? Hey there. You got the files open? Yes. Um, what am I looking at here? We have to pick a couple to play a husband and wife getting ready for a cocktail party where they'll be serving Varma Fruitcake. Anybody giving you a spark? This isn't really what I had in my head. I know, we couldn't get any redheads on such short notice, but I could reach out to another agency. No, that's not what I meant. Where's the warmth and the friendliness? These don't look like people I want to have fruitcake with. Okay. That's sort of the point. It's a... a rebrand, remember? I, I should go write that email. I was going to write to that person. Okay Mira. Why don't you tell me exactly what you do have in your head? When we were little, I would wake up to the smell of fruitcake every Christmas morning. Jay and I would run downstairs in our pajamas, and Nani would be waiting for us by the tree. Wait, where were your parents? They were around, but I'm a first generation American. They came to this country because they wanted to build a successful life. Something that they could give to us one day. So they worked hard building a business. And then Manisha came along, and you know, they just didn't have time for the fun stuff back then. I get it. I mean, my dad missed a lot of little league games. And honestly, they didn't really care that much about Christmas back then. They didn't grow up with it. Well they've definitely caught up since then. I mean, they knew about Christmas. They were starting a holiday fruitcake company. But at home Nani did it all, and mostly for me. Being the only Indian girl at Robert Louis Stevenson Elementary was not so fun. And Nani didn't want me to feel weird or left out at school, so she did everything she could to learn about Christmas so we could celebrate like pros. That's really sweet. Yeah. Nani was the best. It wasn't her culture, but she wanted to make me happy. And she did. I can see why her fruitcake means so much to you. Yeah. Nani was pure love. And she baked it right into her cakes. And these people, they're not showing me the love. That's a beautiful memory, Mira. But I'm trying to create a future for Varma Fruitcakes. And you just keep getting stuck in the past. You know, I think I have to go write an email to someone as well. -Mira? -Hmm? Pass me the firetrucks from the second shelf. There's two. Who put a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking? I thought I was getting through to Brady, but he just doesn't get it. Mira, Brady is a professional. Just let him do what he knows. What he knows is not Nani's kind of Christmas. And it's not what this company is about. Varma Fruitcakes will be about nothing at all if nobody eats them. Mom, I love coming to work every day and being with you guys. I love that it still smells like Nani is here with us. And I don't want any of that to change. Beti, your Nani will always be with us. Look at your hands. They're just like hers. You even have that small freckle on your thumb. The same one. She's in your heart. She's in every cell of you. Remember what Nani used to say? Keep a light touch... ...Or the cake will fall. So maybe keep a little lighter touch with Brady? Mmm. Hmm. It's going to work out. I'll try. Ah! That's my girl. Now, we have a toy drive to complete and I need you to deliver the rest of the donations. Okay. Um, maybe I will get Tim to go with me. Why don't you invite Brady instead. It might help with some of that holiday inspiration you've been trying to give him. Maybe you're right. Mother's always right. That's all the toys for the toy drive. Hey, I used to have one of these when I was a little buckaroo. But did you have the hat and spurs to match? Well, yippee ki yay little filly. I surely did. Aw, now these, these were my thing. Before I was going to rule the fruitcake world, I was going to be a race car driver. There was a time when you weren't obsessed with fruitcakes? It was brief but real. Oh. So where do you donate all these toys? Oh, we take them to the hospitals all around the area and they give them to the kids who are going to be stuck there for Christmas. Ah. Hey, you know we did all the ad work for the Turbo Slime Lab. I bet they'd be willing to donate some product to the cause. People are hitting each other with rolls of wrapping paper over those things. Well, I could get maybe 100 units. Would that be enough? Are you kidding? That would be amazing! Thank you. Yeah. Um... Are you sure this isn't some kind of publicity stunt for your client? You don't think I could ever do anything just out of the kindness of my heart? Christmas is the ultimate ad campaign, right? Touché. But I promise I just want to make a donation. No strings attached. Hey. I can be a pretty nice guy, you know. We'll see. All right. Back to work, nice guy. All right, boss lady. So he makes one phone call, and they don't just give him 100 Slime Labs, they give him 300. What? Yeah. And he gets them all sent directly to each hospital, and he spent the whole evening helping me pick up donations. And he's not charging us for his time. He sounds like a great guy. Yeah. Maybe you should ask him to the world famous Varma holiday party. I thought you were going to be my plus one. Actually, I asked someone else to come with me. What? Tim, you're finally getting back out there? Who is she and why didn't you tell me you're seeing someone? It's all still really new. Okay. But I met her at the support group for people who have lost their spouse. Oh, so she's a widow. Yeah. Okay. Well, we both said we're going to take it slow. Mm-hmm. But I like her. A lot. This is great! Ahhhh!!! So great. Why don't you ask Brady? Oh. I mean, he's nice, but I don't like him that way. -Really? -Yeah. Because he's exactly your type. Okay, I will admit that he's pretty dreamy. But like, in a Manhattan business mogul kind of way. I don't have time for useless entanglements right now. Is that what you're calling first dates these days? You know, I don't need a man to be happy. One can have a complete life on one's own. I know you don't need a man to be happy. But there are plenty of things that I want that I don't need. Like this cookie. I don't need it. But I want it. Woah. It's late and it's Friday. You should probably go do something fun. Yeah, what about you? I want to finish what I'm working on, but you go ahead. Are you sure? Okay. Wait, how do you get back to the hotel? Call a car. Begone with you. Okay. Yeah. Do you want me to turn the light on? You know, it's nice in here. Just leave it. Mm-hmm. How'd you know I was getting off work now? I didn't. But I don't mind waiting for what I want. Where's my umbrella? Hmm, I thought this would be more romantic. You know, waiting out in the rain. Would you like to take me to dinner, Jay Varma? I know just the place. Hmm. This just isn't Christmas. Good morning. Hey there. Just doing some inventory. You almost need sunglasses for those things, don't you? They're bright. Well good thing we have Brady. He brings a whole new perspective. Yeah. Do you and Mom think I can't manage the company? Is that the real reason that you are putting off retirement? Why would you think that? You do everything around here. There'd be no Varma Fruitcakes without you. Are you upset that we hired Brady? I'm not mad. I just thought that since you and mom are thinking about passing the torch, that if there was some big decision to be made, that you would've talked to me about it. Your mother and I, we were just sitting in bed talking over ideas, and I remembered Trevor. And then she said I should ask him to do an ad, I said that's a good idea, so I sent him an email on my phone. It all happened very quickly. Okay. But is there anything else you're not telling me? Like, are we in more trouble than I thought? I don't want you and Mom to be putting yourselves in a bad position. Things are not great. But they aren't totally desperate. And your mother and I would do anything for you kids. That's the whole reason we started Varma Fruitcake. And I would do anything for you guys. Even if that means working with Brady and... not against him? Hmm. Busted. Mm-hmm. He is pretty great, isn't he? Mm. And very attractive. Dad! What, it's my duty to see my daughter settled. And he's from a very good family. I have eyes, beti. I can see the little sparks fly when the two of you look at each other. You should give him a real chance. He might surprise you. -Hello? -Hi. What's up? Um, I was wondering if you could meet me at the bakery. All right. Okay great. So what are we working on? You are going to make a Varma Fruitcake in the very place where my Nani taught me. I'm not much of a cook. I'm not much of a teacher but we'll have to figure it out together. Okay. What's first? Well first you dry the fruit and then you soak the dried fruit in brandy for a month. I might have to take a few appointments between now and then. Lucky for you, that part's already done. So, you need to toss the fruit in the flour so that it doesn't sink to the bottom of the batter. So here, just dump it in. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah. And then gently toss. Okay. What's that? This is ghee. It's clarified butter. It's used in a lot of Indian cooking. It's one of the secrets to making a very tender Kerala Cake. I thought you were keeping all of your Nani's secrets. You can have this one. Because I'm nice. Ahh. Um, I'll grab that. Ooh. So is this what goes into the secret spice blend? Yes. I will let you watch me mix them, but I will not tell you what they are. Can I smell them? Sure. Mm. Smells nutty. But also a little bit like licorice. Is it anise? No. It's cardamom. Oh... Gotcha. Oh, you! Crafty. Okay. You got two of Nani's secrets now. Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go. Thank you. Okay. Ah, ah, ah! Don't you dare. You have to let it cool. Just a taste? No. It'll be worth the wait. You can't expect me to just sit here and stare at this cake if you don't want me to eat it. Wow. Let's go outside. No, it's so cold out. Come on. We won't be out too long. Okay, fine. Look at those stars. Yeah. You know when we were little, during the Christmas season when things got extra busy, my parents would come home for dinner. And then they'd let us come out here and run around in our pajamas. That sounds cute. It was more noisy than cute. But my poor Nani, she probably needed a break. Mm. And we would look up at those stars, and pretend this whole yard was a planet and we were on a space quest. Cool. And we would each pick a star that was our home that we were trying to get back to. See, that's the kind of thing I missed out on being an only child. I bet you were really cute though. A little bit. You know, we did everything together. We liked all the same stuff, we even had matching pajamas. Wow. Yeah. Everything's different now. Of course everything's different now. You probably don't even fit in those pajamas anymore. I know it's different for Jay and Manisha. To them it's just a job, but to me it's my family. It's Nani's Kerala Cake, is what holds us together. I don't think that's true. -No? -No. I've seen how close you all are. But I am scared. Of what? That if we... lose this company, that if we lose Nani's kind of Christmas, we're going to lose each other too. I promise that won't happen. You know, that cake is probably cooled by now. It's cold. I'm just going to pack this up for you. I thought we were going to try it together. I just didn't realize how late it was. Oh. Right yeah, I guess it is kind of late. But hey, time flies when you're having fun. I know I'm not your only account. I shouldn't keep monopolizing your time. Otherwise, what's going to happen when you go back to the city? Hey, we still have time. I should... get home. Hey I um, I... I still have some stuff to do at the office. Do you mind if I head back for a bit? No, that's fine. All right, I'll lock up when I'm done. Okay. See you tomorrow? Aww. So where are we at? Well, Finn has some great ideas to help Jay update the website and increase our online sales. Oh, that's exciting. Yeah. And after spending more time with Brady... Oh yes, we've noticed you two seem to be joined at the hip. Hmm. He's growing on you, eh? I know I gave you guys a lot of pushback about him. It's your job in this family to provide the pushback. It always has been. But you guys were right. And it's time to let him do his marketing magic. Ha! Good for you, Mira. We know change doesn't come easy for you. But change will be a big part of the company when you take over. Uh, was this some kind of test or something? Wait, are you guys going to make an announcement? Well it wasn't a test. And it's not like we're packing today or anything. But we have been thinking about buying an RV. We'll be like snails with a house on our back. With a king sized bed, a full kitchen, and a retractable awning. I want to see America with my beautiful wife by my side. Aww. I hope my husband looks at me that way after 34 years of marriage. You aren't even going to get one year of marriage if we can't even get you out on a date. Mom, stop! I'm doing something with Tim tonight. Tim doesn't count as a date. No, but he's showing me how to use a dating app so it sort of counts. Bless our Tim. Have you taken a picture for your profile? I just bought this wonderful pink lipstick that I think will look perfect on you. Mom... I have plenty of lipstick. I gotta go count some fruitcake. It's true, you look lovely in pink. Thank you Papa. See, even Dad thinks so. Dating app? -Hey. -Hey. Little too cold to work outside tonight? Actually I was going to finish up inside. You know, I haven't seen you today. Hmm. I thought maybe you fell into a vat of fruitcake batter. Sort of. More like a vat of paperwork. There's um, something I want to talk to you about. It's Tim. We have dinner reservations. Can it wait until tomorrow? Yeah, sure. Have a good night, Brady. You too, Mira. Hey... Hey Dad. I take it you got my email? I did. I'm surprised you've decided to move in a new direction with the Varma account. Spending all this time with the Varmas has got me thinking about Granddad and his old ad campaigns. Now I'm making the connection. I decided rather than fighting it, we should latch onto the idea that fruitcake's a retro product and let that be the selling point. I love it. Avinash will too. He's always been the sentimental type. All the Varmas are amazing. I know I... I came into this thinking of it as a throwaway job, but spending time getting to know Mira and the rest of the Varmas? You know, I think I may be having a renaissance. Ah, I see. Mira is Avi's oldest daughter, right? Yeah. She's kind of devoted herself to steeping me in Varma Cakes culture. Uh-huh. Yeah, we've been doing all of these projects like... well, making a Christmas stocking, and decorating, and... Brady, I didn't call to discuss the Varmas. Huh? I wanted to tell you we got Origin Electric. That's incredible, Dad! And we're going to need you back here as soon as possible to get things running on the account. We can't just leave the Varmas with nothing. They're depending on me. Plus we aren't done with the toy drive and... and I promised I'd go caroling with them tomorrow. Finn can finish this off for you, Brady. He's ready and you've already laid a strong groundwork. But I'm not ready. Brady, I need you for this. We made big promises and we won't get a second chance. It's just that Mira... Your grandpa would be the first to tell you that success involves a great deal of personal sacrifices. I've certainly made my share of them. But building this company is bigger than just you and me, Brady. I understand. I'll be back in Seattle by tomorrow night. The sooner the better. I know, Dad. I'll... I'll see you tomorrow. It's a full-scale social media blitz, in conjunction with a ton of online influencers. Collabs are so hot right now, and by crossing over audiences we get maximum exposure. Have you talked to Brady about this? This is... this is great stuff. Brady is really supportive, but if I roll it out as his junior everyone will just assume it was his idea. Then use it as a launching point to get your own campaign. I told you, he doesn't think I'm ready. What? Um... Look, you've been encouraging me to follow my dreams, and that's what finally got me to reach out to a few of my old contacts... about coaching. -For snowboarding? -Yeah. You're doing it? Yeah, it's not set in stone and my family doesn't quite know about it yet, but one of my old coaches is looking for someone to train his more junior boarders. I am so happy for you. Come here! That's so amazing. Hey. You should take your own advice, all right? I think it's time you go for it too. Why are you always right? I don't know. What did you say? Huh? Oh, I'm practicing my French. She puts together another box. Practicing for what? Okay. Do you remember Elise? Sure. Well she's been living and working in Paris at this magazine. She saw my vlog and she thinks that I can get an apprenticeship there. You are not moving to Paris. What about the company? What about it? I mean, Jay, Mom and Dad are here. Plus you can run the company with your eyes closed. That is not the point. Honestly, Mira. Everyone's cool with it. You should be too. And besides I don't even like fruitcake. How can you not like fruitcake? Oh... Does Mom know about this? Yeah, no, about that. She may or may not have caught me feeding it to the cat a couple years ago. You fed fruitcake to the cat? Boite. Hey everybody, Brady's here. What? What's going on? Did I forget to tell you about the Christmas sweaters? Yeah, you definitely forgot to tell me about that. Okay. Well don't worry about it, we have lots of extras. No, no. Don't go to any trouble on my account. It's tradition. You're not thinking about kicking up a fuss are you? Oh no. I know better than to argue with you when it comes to Christmas traditions. Good. Hey. I didn't know you were caroling. Um... This has become about more than just work for me. I hope you understand. Brady? I understand completely. Come on, let's practice. Come on, come on, come on. Let's practice. One, two, three, four. ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ Brady? Hey, I think this should fit you. Enjoy the lights. Wow, of all the things I thought I'd be doing tonight, wearing a Christmas sweater with lights was not one of them. You can change in there. Merry Christmas! Hey! All right. Okay, okay, okay. Mira, Tim, have you guys practiced your duet? Oh, we've just been super busy. You know how it gets this time of the year. Yeah, I don't think we're going to have time for it. They have been doing this since their grade one Christmas concert. I think that you two should just do it for us here. To make sure that you're good to go. In the Varma family there is no willy-nilly when it comes to Christmas caroling. That's right, no willy-nilly. Fine, fine. You ready? One, two, three. ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin, mother and child ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ That was so beautiful. Okay everybody outside, scarves, toques. Okay, okay, okay! And we're taking two cars because there's so many of you. Okay. -Good voice. -Thanks. Hey um, by the way. I heard about Origin Electric. Congratulations. Yeah. I need to tell you something about that. But I haven't talked to Mira yet, so if you could just keep it quiet for a little bit longer? Trevor called me this afternoon. He was worried you might be distracted and need some help wrapping up? Huh? I know you don't want to hurt her. But I really believe she's going to be fine. She's got a lot of love and support here. You're right. Yeah. Yeah, she can do anything she wants. Yeah, she can. Yeah. I'm glad you came. Yeah. Mira, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. I would've told you this sooner, but really there was just so much going on. What's up? Well uh, Phillips Woolsey just got this big new client. Huge, really. Origin Electric. Wow. That's so great. Yeah, my father's putting me in charge of the account. Oh. So I have to drive back to Seattle, right away. Well what about Varma Fruitcakes? We're just getting started. Finn will be taking over. And I know he'll do a great job. When are you leaving? Tonight. I am so sorry. I should probably get inside and help my mom. Have a safe drive. And Merry Christmas, Brady. Merry Christmas, Mira. So. Thank you for all... Thank you all for coming. I'm very excited to tell you about the launch of our... Finn? Yeah? What's a woke? Woke, um... Woke is really about being in the know. And that's what we wanna do with our social media takeover. Ooh! How do you take over the whole social media? Dad, no. The social media's not one thing. It's like when different influencers talk about the product. Like the girl Manisha is always watching, that hauls the clothes from all the stores. Mom, she doesn't haul clothes. It's a "clothing haul," like when you buy, you know... Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all very exciting. And I've been in contact with a ton of influencers who are going to vlog and post for what I'm calling #NationalFruitcakeDay. Woah, Woah! There's a holiday for fruitcake? How did we not know this? There's no holiday for fruitcake. What's he saying? I... It's not actually a holiday. Finn is just trying to whip up interest. Exactly. And the reason I gather you all on a Sunday is we have to overnight all the fruitcake swag bags and I was hoping you'd help me pack them. Sure. Doesn't that sound like fun everybody, huh? Yeah. Uh, what's in the swag bags? Well, fruitcake of course. And tote bags. And... Oh. Look at the sweater. And don't forget the hats. That's a fruitcake. Okay. Do we have any control over what the influencers will be saying? Well, no. Part of the deal is that they make independent content. But they're all on board. And you're sure of this? Of course. It's all going to be a lot of fun. And by the end of the day, fruitcake will be trending. This is all very exciting. They're especially interested in promoting their clean energy efforts, so we'll want to showcase them as a green friendly company. Might not be a bad idea for you to take a trip out to California, see some of the wind technology work they're doing out in the desert. Brady? Brady, are you listening? Sorry. I'm just brainstorming in my head. You're already giving me a lot of ideas. I... I really need you to stay centered. I'm sorry. I just haven't slept well these last couple of nights. I'm just readjusting. I get it. Take the afternoon if you need to. Open your mail, get caught up on your Christmas shopping. Tomorrow you have your first team meeting. You know, I think work is the best thing for me. Speaking of which, I've got a lot of research to do. Is... is this everything? That's it. You go do what you do. Why can't we see anything? Because it's a livestream. They should be logging on any second. The Dare Guy's huge. I can't believe Finn got him. What kind of dare can you even do with a fruitcake? What's up dare guys and gals? It's me, The Dare Guy, coming to you live from The Dare Mom's house. And today, we're celebrating National Fruitcake Day! I don't know. Anyway, I got here 26 slices of fruitcake and I'm going to eat them all in one minute. Bob, you ready? Guys, what you got to remember with these things is the only rules are there are no rules! Well, I do have to get all the cakes down without hurling. Okay? Our fruitcakes don't make people sick. It's all in fun. People love it. Yeah, like last year he jumped into a pool full of marshmallows. Three, two, one, Dare Guy go! Oh, we should've done water bottles! Manisha, shh! That was... Awesome! Was it? I did not hurl! Guys, thanks for watching. Have a good one. Peace. But he didn't even say Varma Fruitcakes. This was just the first one. I'm going to send out an email memo to the other influencers. I promise we're going to get on top of this. I don't think we should've ever done this. People are going to make fun of fruitcake now. I can't believe we actually paid money to make things worse. Go take care of your sister. Seriously? Okay, okay. This will blow over. Yeah. Right in time for our going out of business sale. Oh, don't be a defeatist Mir. Okay listen. Mom called and she wants us to come over to watch a Christmas movie. I think we all need to take our minds off fruitcake. I really should stay and go through emails. Customer service is extra important right now. All that product we gave away is an additional loss. Mir, come on. Look. You need to eat and Mom's making biryani. -Ooh. -Mm-hmm. All right. Um... but I'm going to take my work with me. Yeah, no. Computer stays. There are other computers. Hot chocolates to go. What's up dare guys and gals? It's me, The Dare Guy. Hello, this is Mira. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you. You should hang it up for the night. Join in. I'm not feeling too merry and bright. A lot of long nights in this business. A lot of hard work and pressure. I can handle it Dad. But for me, the thing that always kept me going was knowing I was coming home to you and your mom. You know, you never missed dinner. Even if you had to come back to the office afterwards. This company has allowed me to build a beautiful life, and I couldn't be more proud of you for following in your grandfather's and my footsteps. Thank you, Dad. But Brady. You don't have to do things exactly the way we did. I'm always so blown away by your talent and ideas. Dad? And I know you've got it in you to give twice what your grandpa and I did, and still have all you need to go after the things that are really important. Like Mira. Dad, she makes me laugh. She makes me want to care as much as she does about things that most people just take for granted. And she made me see that Christmas could be magical in a way that I never saw it before. Well then, go get her. I think I screwed up big time. I've had your mother so mad at me that she could roast a turkey with the fire in her eyes. But one of the best things about love is that it's very forgiving. I should get back out there. Thanks Dad. Okay, It's A Wonderful Life gets me like every time. A retro-chic campaign. -Manisha! -Huh? -Look at this. -What? Oh, wow. Check this out. I think we can fix this disaster. Right? Uh-huh. Hey. Mira. I just want to apologize. I moved too quickly on the social media thing, and I should've... Wait. It's going to be okay, Finn. I have a plan. What are you going to do? Show them. I found Brady's ideas. He wanted to do a retro-chic ad campaign mirroring all the best traditions that I love about fruitcake, with an aesthetic that appeals to the modern hipster. This is genius. Yeah. I made some initial calls to get the ads into print, and I would like you and Manisha to handle the social media element. Are you sure? If we're going to make this work, we're going to need all hands on deck. Jay Varma reporting for duty. Mom confirmed that the shipper can still guarantee delivery by Christmas. And Mir had me reach out to all the local coffee shops. Every one of them is going to feature our fruitcakes. I think this is going to work, you guys. One, two, three. Go Varmas! Woo! What? Amazing. ♪ Good King Wenceslas looked out ♪ ♪ On the feast of Stephen ♪ ♪ When the snow lay round about ♪ ♪ Deep and crisp and even ♪ ♪ Brightly shone the moon that night ♪ ♪ Though the frost was cruel ♪ Merry Christmas. Ohhh! Congratulations on your big ad campaign. Thank you. You know your dad put an extra order in to keep up with the rush. What? Are you kidding? I'm so proud of you. Oh, thank you so much. ♪ Hither, page, and stand by me ♪ ♪ If though know it telling ♪ ♪ Yonder peasant, who is he ♪ ♪ Where and which his dwelling ♪ ♪ Sire, he lives a good league hence ♪ Brady. I wasn't expecting you! I would've picked you up from the airport. Oh, I drove. I came to congratulate Phillips Woolsey's newest partner on a very successful holiday ad campaign. Honestly, if it hadn't been for Mira finding all your ideas and pulling everything together, this would be a very different party. Well the Varmas have had nothing but nice things to say about you and all of your hard work. You deserve the promotion. I probably should've seen that sooner. They make a great couple. What are you talking about? Oh, here she is. Mira, this is my date, Rachel. So nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. Well, I hope it's all good. It's all good. You know, I've been spending a lot of time with Mira. She doesn't gush a lot when she gets really excited about something, but she does get this little sparkle in her eye. I've seen that too. She does get that sparkle every time she talks about you. I don't know what to do. Should I say anything or should I be patient? I don't want to push. Can you wait here a second? What? Just hang on. Just wait right here. Okay, okay. You have a special guest. Hi. When did you get here? Sorry to be a party crasher. I don't want to step in on your family Christmas. No. I mean, what took you so long? So. I guess this is where things get complicated, huh? I don't have everything figured out, but I just know that I don't want to spend another Christmas without you. You ready for your gift? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Tickets to Paris? Think of it as a Christmas bonus. You deserve to follow your dreams, Manisha. Thank you. And... Oh! For your future adventures. Aww, I love it. Just remember, you can always drive that RV back home. Aww. Hey, when did you have time to get this? When you're a big famous coach, I want front row seats to the Olympics. -Thank you. -Me too. You managed to get everyone the perfect gift. I didn't know you were coming back, so I didn't get you anything. I have everything I need, right here.
