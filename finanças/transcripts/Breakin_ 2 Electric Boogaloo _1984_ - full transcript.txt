[Cassette rewinding] [I believe in the beat playing] [Audience applauding] Boy, I'm sure glad this show is closing. Me, too. You have another gig lined up after this? No, but I know I don't want to do another chorus line. Well, Kelly, now that you've left your life in the theater, maybe you'd reconsider my offer of four years at Princeton. I haven't quit, dad. I'm just taking a break. I've told you a million times, dance is my life. I don't understand. With your intelligence and the opportunities that I could provide... What about your young friend, that lawyer? What's his name? Derek? He wanted to marry you. Why did you break up with him? Derek is a nerd. And you're the one that liked him, not me. At least she's not spending time with those street people anymore, darling. Look, I come home to relax with you guys, not argue. But we are relaxing, dear. Mr. Bennett: I'm not arguing with you, Kelly. I'm telling you. I don't like the life you're leading. It's my life, dad. [Sighs] [Chattering] We don't clean up for any of the other girls like this. This place is a mess. It needs cleaning anyway. You just now realized that? The mere sound of Kelly's voice on the phone drives the funk from your dingy socks away. You should have more respect for our dance partner. Girl: Hey, look who's here! Girls: Kelly! [Honking] Hey, Kelly! Turbo! Ozone! Hey, turbo, it's good to see you. Good to see you. Look at that rod.Hi. I really missed you. That's a sharp car. Looks like show business is treating you good. Actually, I'm pretty burned out. Yeah, I've been hustling for pennies. Doesn't it seem like dancing is just the same old tune? Yeah, I know. All those auditions and cattle calls. "We'll call you next week." Kid: Hey, look who's here! It's Kelly! Special k!

They're really good. Ozone: No, they're kids. They're from the neighborhood. The ghetto. I'm telling you, this place is fresh. This is great! This place is great for the kids, Kelly. Look. Man, you have mirrors. This is great. Wait till you meet Byron. Where is he? What's happening, champ? How are you?All right. Good to see you. Hey, hot stuff! What's going on? How they doing anyway? They're doing all right. Not deadly but they're determined. What's this? Who's the new talent? This is Kelly. She's our dance partner. Kelly, this is Byron, the dude that runs this place. Good to meet you.Hey. It's a pleasure. You must be the one who danced with these two turkeys. Yeah. It looks like you're doing a great job with these kids here. We try. If you have any spare time, drop around. We can always use help around here. All right. I'll talk to you later. Got to get back to work now. Come on, I want you to meet my kids.Okay. These kids got a lot of talent. Michael! Get off! Look at those girls. They get off! Come on, you guys, I want you to meet Kelly. How're you doing? Michael, why don't you get out here and show us what you got? That's fresh! Try it like this. Hey, come on. Let's turn the music up! Got to get somebody down here with a couple of flatbeds. I don't know. How long will it be before we can start this project? Not long. It'll come down soon. Should pass through channels in about three weeks. Randall, I want this building. This is the perfect site. So how did you wind up here, anyway? When Byron found it, it was a dump, Kelly. Yeah? We all got together and fixed it up. It looks fantastic. You guys did a great job. Yeah, well. The kids really mean a lot to you? It's like a second home to all of us. This place is great. I love being here. You're between jobs, aren't you? Yeah. You could teach. You think it'd be okay? You heard what Byron said, didn't you? [Imitating Byron] "We need all the help we can get." I tell you, I would love working here. Well, all right! Mr. Douglas: I want to build that shopping center. I want to build it on the site that we talked about. The property values in that area are just going to take off. And that building that the kids are in, that has got to go. I'm working on it, but you know commissioner snyder is soft on these so-called "community projects." Randall, I want zoning's cooperation. [Din daa daaplaying] Randall: I'm counting on you to get it for me. Wait a minute, isn't this a city building? Yes, the city loaned it to some kind of local group for a community center. They call it something... "Miracles," that's it. Miracles. What an inspiring name. What do they do here? It's just designed to keep kids off the street. They have classes in art and dancing, that kind of thing. These ventures come and go. The key thing though is that our current engineering reports show that that building is structurally unsound. It would be more cost effective at this point to tear the building down, and offer the property for sale. And I don't think it would be bad if we took this area and put in a shopping center here. Mrs. Snyder: But where will all those kids go? They've got their club, radiotron. Well, Mr. Randall, you might be right.Good.

It's a whole lot of nickels and dimes. We gotta try, champ. Byron: Ms. Snyder, we received this letter saying that you people plan to tear our building down. Yes, Mr. Smith. I know about that letter. What can we do to save miracles? Listen, kids, I really am on your side. But the best that I'm able to do is get you a 30-day grace period so that you can raise some money to renovate that building. We appreciate your 30-day grace period, but do you really think that's long enough to raise that kind of money? [Mrs. Snyder chuckles] I don't know. But I do know this is your only chance.

Not looking too good, is it? Come on, you guys, it's a start. But we don't have too much time before the end. $7,000 is not going to impress the zoning committee at all. Why don't we just put on a show? Like those big ones with the dancing and juggling. We could have it in the streets. Like a street festival. I'll dance! I could choreograph. I'll run rehearsals. And of course, I could be the star. So they called you about me? Yes, they're considering you for the lead. It opens in Paris. In Paris? You're kidding. Stanley! That's great! Relax. You still have to audition. I'll call you when they set a date, if I can find you. You've been hard to reach lately. I've been teaching at this community center. It's very noble, but don't let it interfere with your career. I have had a lot of time on my hands lately. Don't worry, that'll all change. Okay, I'm going to hold you to that. Nice to be working with you again, ozone. Yeah, it is. Here, help me carry this. Sure. Okay. Back it up. Hi! Sorry I'm late. Hi, Kelly. Guess what? Stanley got me an audition. I might be the lead in a show that's going to Paris. Isn't that great? Yeah. But what about this show? You guys got a lot done. You gonna stick with us or what? Electro rock! Ozone: Hey, let's take these suckers! Later, sucker. I'll get that guy! [All clamoring] Ozone. You been off the street too long, blood. You got lazy. You lost your edge. You're the loser, punk.

You get back to work, and you, kid, you get out of here. Look, let's pack up. We've got enough for now to go on. Over there! Hey, hold on, buddy, what's going on here? What are you fellows doing here with that equipment? Well, we're making a preliminary survey of potential construction sites. The name is Douglas. Whoever you are, you got no business coming around here with that equipment. We haven't had a hearing yet. And you don't own this property yet. I'm very aware of the fact that the city owns it. Are you, perhaps, a city official? No, we're the legal tenants here. That's a situation I don't think will last very long. Yeah, well, look here, hot shot, you can forget your plans, man, 'cause we're going to stop you. We're going to stop you cold. I doubt if an arrogant bunch of street kids have the power to... You don't how much power we really have, do you? We'll go to the press, and we'll fight this thing all the way. Well, it's your time. Waste it if you want to. Is that man going to take away miracles? No, we're not gonna let him. Yo, turbo. Hey, man, you know, we should work on some new moves, man. Somethin' fresher than fresh, man. Somethin' funkier than funky. You know what I mean? Yeah, man, let's put on... Let's put on some Ollie and Jerry. Yeah, that'd be cool. [Knocking] Rhonda: Hi, ozone. Ozone, I'd like to talk to you. What do you want to talk about? Hi. Bye. Are you going with that Kelly now? Oh, girl, what difference does that make? It makes a difference to me. It shouldn't. Look, that thing between us, baby, was over a long time ago. Well, I still love you, ozone. Look, Rhonda, I'm sorry. Forget it! I don't need your sympathy, ozone! What do you want? You know what I want? I want you to stay away from that girl! [Hisses] Girls are whacked. [Cheering] [Speaking Spanish] Come on. Hey, man, what did she say? She thinks you're sexy. She wants to dance with you. Go on, man, I think she likes you. Yo, ozone, you think I look like a stud? Did you say something? You think I got sex appeal, dude? Gimme a break. You're acting weird. Dude, I need some advice. What advice? I wanna know how to start off with a girl, dude. Yeah? You mean, you're askin' me how to get it on with a girl? Well, something like that. All right. If that's the case, I'll show you a few tricks of the old master. There's two phases to this. There's phase number one. You got to get the girl interested. Then there's phase number two, the old tactical maneuver. First, you've got to get the girl to come to you. After that, you've got to play it cool. You walk by like this. Real close. Then you look at her. Only, she doesn't know you're looking. Now you try it. Go ahead. Okay, suppose she knows I'm there. What do I do next? Tell her I love her? No, if you tell her that... She doesn't even know you yet. Can I kiss her?No. Do that, and she'll punch your lights out. Then what do I do? You do like I do. You just stand there and you smile. Smile? Like this? No, matter of fact, don't smile at all. Well then, can I kiss her now? No, you whisper in her ear. Whisper what? You know, softly, like, "hey, baby, you look fine. "I like you. Hey, check this out." Butter up to her. Try it. Here, try it. Go ahead. You have the nicest teeth. No, man, she's not a horse. Tell her about her eyes. Your eyes are so Move over. Let's start from scratch. Let me show you how you do it. Here we go. Everybody. Thank you. Thank you all very much. Every one of you did a fine job. I'll contact your agents about the part next week. Thank you very much. Now I know this director. Your chances with him are excellent. Man, I wish I could know right now. I don't know what I'm going to tell ozone, though. All you used to talk about was your work, now all I hear is ozone, ozone. Are you in love with the guy? Come on, Stanley. I just like the way he dances. What's this Stanley tells me about our daughter dancing in Paris? Darling, she doesn't have the job yet. I also understand that she's been back in the streets with that bozo or turbine or whatever the hell their names are. She isn't in the streets, she's volunteering. It's charity work. She's helping all those poor, little, underprivileged children. Yeah, I'm going to do something about this nonsense. I don't know what you can do. Kelly's old enough to make her own decisions. I'm going to find a way. Call her up. Yes, dear. Get her over here for dinner. Yes, dear. I want to talk to that girl. Yes, dear. [Glass shattering] You know, maybe my father could help. I'm invited over for dinner tomorrow night. Why don't you guys come over? That's a whacked idea. Why? He's an intelligent man. He can help us out or give us good advice. I don't beg from rich people. I work for what I get. I thought you'd do anything for those kids. Well, it's not that. I don't want to use you, Kelly. That's okay. Yeah?yeah. Wow, this is some layout. When you said money, I wasn't expecting all this. Come on, ozone, they're just people. Rich people. Very rich people. They're also my family. So are we. I know. Come on. [Doorbell ringing] Hi, Rosa. I'd like you to meet my friends. This is ozone and turbo. [Greeting in Spanish] Hi, mom. Hello, dear. Good to see you. Kelly: How you been doing? So you must be turbo and ozone. You certainly have original names. Unique flair for fashion, which apparently is rubbing off on my daughter. Thank you. [Doorbell rings] That must be dad. Thank you.Kelly: Derek? Hello, Evelyn. You look lovely as always. I'm so happy you could accept our invitation. Thank you very much. Hello, Kelly. Hi. Boys, this is Derek Sloane, Kelly's fiance. Hi.what's up? Hello. Kelly: Mother. What's he doing here? You know I can't stand him. Mrs. Bennett: Don't blame me, I didn't know. Well, your father thought it would be a good idea. Sharp outfit. We know. Hi, dad.Hi, honey. I want you to meet my friends. Ah. Good to see you. How are you?Very good. How's your law practice coming along? Very well. Fortunately, in Hollywood, everybody sues everybody. Shall we dine? Bon appetit. So, what do you think? Mr. Bennett: Good? See, Mrs. B, everyone loves your cooking. Mrs. Bennett: They should. After all, you spent a fortune sending me to cordon bleu. Mr. Bennett: It was well worth it. Mrs. Bennett: But I do enjoy it. Kelly: It's pretty good. Mrs. Bennett: This is the first time I've tried this dish, but I'm really rather pleased. Derek: Wonderful. Mrs. Bennett: Yes, it is good. Mr. Bennett: You know, I think I'm going to have just a little bit more, if I may. [Laughing] Mr. Bennett: Well, boys, how are things going down at your club? Kelly tells me you've been doing wonderful things for these poor, little deprived children. Actually, miracles is having some trouble, dad. Those people can't stay out of trouble, no matter what. You're looking at one of "those people." Derek didn't mean to be rude. Did you, Derek? Derek always means to be rude. Well, what kind of trouble are you in? We're not in trouble, our building is. They want to tear it down and build a stupid shopping center there. But they're giving us a chance to save the building. Oh, I see. You're here for money. I know what you people do with money. You mismanage it. You spend it on drugs and fancy clothes and cars. Dad! I don't see any point in throwing good money after bad. Come on, turbo. Look, we don't need your help. We can take care of our own. And thanks for the dinner, Mrs. Bennett. Turbo: Yes, we loved your cooking. Could we have a roll? Arrogant riffraff. Kelly: Sorry about the other night. I should have known better. My parents live in a world all their own. That's okay. I kinda liked your cat. Ozone was really mad, though. He was mad, but he wasn't mad at you. It was just... Don't worry about it. He'll cool off. Kelly, listen to this situation. I've got this friend. He likes this girl. Does she like him? Yeah. Then what's the problem? Well, it's just that he gets so confused because he's such a cool dude, and he's never had these feelings before. This must be a good friend of yours, turbo. Yeah. Don't worry about it so much. I've seen her looking at you. It's just that, I don't know what to say or do. Just say yes. "Yes"?yes. Yes!

This would not only upgrade the entire area, but make it commercially viable. Viable for who? [Striking gavel] The chair, at this time, does not recognize comments from the floor. And the floor recognizes this panel's trying to push us out of our neighborhood. I object to this outrageous interruption! Mr. Randall, this is a public meeting. Right. And the public says that miracles is more than just a piece of property. [Crowd shouting encouragement] It's people. Miracles is the lifeline of our kids. Now, we know what kids can do with pistols, knives and needles. Miracles makes them feel good about themselves. Gives them something to look forward to. Gives them a sense of achievement. And it's not by stepping on people. It's by working hard and working together. [Cheering] Those are certainly admirable goals, sir, and the city greatly appreciates your efforts. But the fact is that the building that houses miracles has been considered unsafe. [All exclaiming] Woman: It's not unsafe. And, unfortunately, you just haven't come forward with enough funds to save it. But we're working on a show. We'll make lots of money. Commissioner, it's clear that it's beyond these people's resources to provide the necessary improvements for this building. In light of the fact that the city has already received a healthy bid from Mr. Douglas, [crowd booing] The planning office recommends to the zoning board that we approve the development plan for this proposed shopping center. You're crazy.Crazy? Order! Order here! I'm afraid that the zoning committee has no choice but to accept the development bid on the property currently occupied by miracles. What? Kid: You're crazy. You guys are whacked, man. Whacked? Who... And the building will have to be vacated within the next two weeks. Wait a minute. This hearing is adjourned. Yo, Douglas. You haven't won yet. You may have the city dancing to your music, but you don't have us. Get out of my way. Hey, man, we're going to stop you, commission or no commission. Listen, if you cause me more trouble, I'll finish you, your friends, and your whole damned neighborhood. Listen, sucker! What are we going to do now?

[Knocking] Dad? I find this hard to believe, but Stanley tells me that you backed out of that Paris deal in order to run off with that street dancer. Well, may I come in? Sure. Oh, boy. I've got an offer for you, Kelly. I'll bail out miracles, pay the cost of renovation on the condition that you stay out of that neighborhood, and go to Princeton. I really do want to help miracles. Maybe I should do it. A very sensible decision. No, you won't. I can't let you do that. That's not what you want. That's not what you are. Why don't you just stay out of this? I told you, we can take care of ourselves. We don't need your money. But we do need you. You really mean that. Mr. Bennett: Wise up. Your pride can't afford to turn down an offer like this. And what do you know about pride? Pride's more important to our kids than your money will ever be. Nobody is going to tell me when to lay down my pride. Let me tell you something. That theater, or whatever it is, of yours, that's just another public project that takes good money and throws it down the toilet. Why are you always so negative about everything? Everything that I have ever wanted to do, you have always been against it. Dad, I'm staying. You're making a big mistake, Kelly. I've got to get out of here. I've got to get back to miracles and help with the show. [Speaking Spanish] I can't be laying up in this traction. You don't understand. You must help me get out of here. It's very important for me to get out of here. I can't lie in bed... Look. This belongs on stage, not in no hospital. [Shushing] Come on. Are you new here? You have to take linens down in the service elevator. Me no english. When are they going to hire some help that speaks the language? [Imitating Woody woodpecker] Guess who? Hey, you guys ready for the show? Tear this show up, right on. Girl: What's she doing here? I thought I told you to stay away from here. I didn't take your advice. I can see that. Kelly, I'm only going to tell you this one more time. Leave. You're not going to tell me what to do or where to go. I liked it a lot better here with you gone, and I want it to stay that way. You think you're so tough, don't you? Well, you don't have your bodyguards. You know, I turned down a good job in Paris to stay here and not you or anybody is going to tell me when to leave. I'm staying! [Motor revving] What are we going to do, ozone? I know what we're going to do. Turn on the music. [Music playing] Get out of here! Move away! Get off that machine! What's going on here? Look at this. Never mind that. I said to get this thing moving. Now get it moving! Okay, you're right. Mr. Douglas: Damn right, I'm right. Hey! Hey, what's going on? Hey, that's turbo. Come on now, move it! Get out of the way. Get out of here, man, what's up? [Cheering] Get away from there, kid. You going to run me over with the bulldozer? You going to try break down the building? You'll have to get past me, sucker. Man, I said stop! Why did you stop?The kid... I don't care about the kid. Knock that stage down now! No way.What do you mean, "no way"? You paid for a job, not to kill kids. Who're you working for? You wait here. I'll get that kid out of the way. I'm staying right here, man. Let's go, let's get out of here. [Cheering] Where are you going? Bring that machine back here! You'll not work again for me! Bring that machine back! Okay. We'll be right here, we'll get the background, okay? Good afternoon. This is Howard Howard, channel 3 news. Today, the little guys are going to take on the big guys. Right behind me here you see a bunch of spunky kids who are getting ready to fight city hall in their own way. Why? Because they don't want this community center torn down for a shopping center. There's a gentleman here I'd like to bring in. This is Mr. Ken Randall, from the city planning office. Howard Howard, channel 3 news. I've got a quick question for you. Will the city let these kids lose their community center? No, the city is here for the people. And there's obviously been some kind of a snafu here. These things happen, even in the best of cities. But I can assure you that we will do everything to straighten this out for the benefit of those deserving youngsters. And that's good news. The gentleman coming here is Mr. Douglas, Douglas construction. Mr. Douglas is head of the firm that wants to tear down this site. Howard, may I take Randall? It's important. I need some information. Certainly. What did you say to that guy? I said it was a snafu. What do you mean, "snafu"? The mayor doesn't need bad publicity in an election year. Are you telling me that you and the city are going to pull out of this? Yes. Mr. Douglas. Question, sir. What action do you plan to take against these kids blocking your project? Oh, well. We're not going to take any action. We of the Douglas construction company feel we won't disrupt the community, we will withdraw from the project. [All cheering] This is a new and dramatic development, here. I would like to get a little reaction and comment from Mr. Byron Smith. Well, you just heard Mr. Douglas change his mind on the whole affair. And I'm sure that Mr. Douglas will make a nice, sizeable contribution to help us pay our loan just fine. That right, Mr. Douglas? A contribution, yes. It was suggested that $3,000... [Clears throat] That was suggested by Mr. Randall. But we, of course, of the Douglas corporation, feel that $6,000 [clearing throat] Really isn't enough for this project. Therefore... In fact, we're going to make a donation of $10,000! [Cheering] Howard: As you can see, there's a lot of excitement here today. Finally the little guys are coming out on top and I think that victory deserves a lot of applause from all of us. Ozone, quick question! Howard Howard, channel 3 news. You really danced your way to victory today. Well, it's not over yet. We need a miracle to save miracles. We're $150,000 short. Why don't you tell them about it? We're having a show today, right here, to raise money to save miracles. There will be dancing, juggling, the whole works. So come down, enjoy yourself and celebrate with us. I'd like to see you there. [Music playing] My god, it's Kelly! I do wish she'd do something about that hair. [Cheering] How about it for the miracles dancers? Put your hands together for them one more time. Now we'd like to bring, for your appreciation, put your hands together and welcome, if you will, Mr. Ice t and hot tot! Yeah, party people in the place to be! First thing I want you to do is clap your hands. Everybody, clap your hands. ♪ We're here for one reason you know it's true ♪ got to raise a lot of money before the day is through ♪ this is not a party, but a demonstration ♪ to try to counteract the city council's legislation ♪ we must save the miracles the time is now ♪ all together, we can do it somehow ♪ so reach to your pocket and give us a sign ♪ a quarter, a nickel or even a dime ♪ everybody in the place sing along with me ♪ everybody in the place, g-i-v-e ♪ Say "give"!Give! ♪ Give, for miracles to live, say "give"! ♪ Give, so miracles can live ladies and gentlemen, as we check out the scoreboard, we have $70,000, and we need $200,000. So please, reach into your pockets. Right now, welcome, if you will, little Lee! These kids have put together such a show here today and single-handedly have raised over $150,000, which is some feat. But it's not enough. They have more to go. They have to raise at least $200,000. Are they going to make it? We're going to support them. You've got to hand it to those kids. They really fight for what they believe in. Darling, that's what we always taught Kelly to do. Didn't we? You know, Mrs. B, I think you're right. Let's go. Right now, once again, here they are, the fabulous miracles dancers. Dad, what are you doing here? I thought you... I've been thinking. I guess we all have to live our lives the best way we possibly can. You kids have done a great job here today. I'm proud of you, Kelly. All of you. Even without Princeton? Yeah, even without Princeton. Thank you, dad! All right! [Exclaiming] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm holding in my hand, thanks to the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, a check for $50,000! We made it! We saved miracles! Thank you! We made it, we made $200,000!
