[cans clink] - Hey! Fucking kids. [traffic humming] - Give me that. [water trickles] [water lapping] [tense music builds] [music continues] [traditional Asian music] [music continues] [birds chirping] [grass rustling] [pig oinking] - Come on, Stinky. - Hold this for a second. [urinating] [horn wailing] Paul! - Coming. - Hurry up. - Yup. [door rattles] [pig oinking] - There you are. Get to work! [machines whirring] - Paul, smell this! [pigs oinking] Come on. You two, over there. You two, go get more. [bang] [match strike] - From earth and dirt grew a girl, different from all the others. - Was she beautiful? - Her teeth were white as snow. And her name was Hygeia. [children whispering] She was pure of heart. The world loved the girl, and she loved the world. Whoever she touched, was made healthy, and whoever drank from her chalice remained healthy forever. But Dirt hated this child, for she had the power to end his dominion. He sent out two snakes to kill her. At night they slipped under her gown... And bit her on the breast. - Yummy. - But as the snakes drank Hygeia's blood, they lost their poison. Their skin turned a brilliant white, and from then on, whoever tasted their poison awoke purified before the gates of Elysion, the paradise of the blissful, which only the pure may enter. - Good night, Irina. - Good night, Paul. - Irina? - Yes? - What happens to the ones who aren't pure? The dirty ones? - The dirty ones... They go to the eternal garbage dump, where there are rats that slowly eat you up from the inside. Maggots and worms. But don't worry. We're safe here. - Yes. [wind howling] - Paul! Move it! [angelic music] Hurry up! [feet clomping] - [P/A] Pure the skin, pure the heart within. [organ music] - A long, long time ago, the world was black. There was no air, and no sun. Only earth, dirt, and filth. - Just like it still is out there! [all laughing] - But from earth and dirt, a goddess grew. Let us welcome he who will lead us to her. [gong rings] [percussive music] ♪ Fust has come from far away ♪ He means us well ♪ He'll never stray ♪ Against the dirt ♪ He'll win the war ♪ If we love him evermore [coughs] [group laughs] - Frog in my throat. It's a sign I should keep my mouth shut. [laughing] [whistling] Do you hear? Do you hear me? Do you hear it? The silence? - Paul! Stop it! - Nothing is more pure than silence. [light guitar music] - Why did you stop visiting me? I can't sleep. You must wash me. I must wash you. - Shh... Be quiet, Maria. - Paul! I told you to stop that! - [rattling] - [gasps] - The firstlings. Perhaps you think you are nothing. Dirt. But nothing is more valuable than your sacrifice. What you wrestle from the dirt is... Just a bar of soap, right? [gasping] [gasping] [applauding] It is nothing we can grasp. Nothing we can fathom. Nothing we can touch with hands of clay, nor comprehend with dull minds. Please, give it back to me. Don't you want to give it to me? [gasping] You must learn to let go. - I'm sorry. - [laughing] - You're such an idiot. - You have a job, Albrich. To keep your people under control. Do you understand? - [whips] - [grunts in pain] - I look after the factory, keep the workers in order. I protect the soap. That is my sacred duty. - [whips] - [grunts in pain] - Albrich... I have an assignment which will allow a worm like you to raise itself out of the earth. Will you accept it? - Anything you ask. - [whips] - [grunts in pain] - Ah. [water lapping] - Paul. Paul, stop it. - Get up. Come with me. This place stinks worse than a monkey brothel. [eerie music] - [light gasp] [door closes] - Come in. You're just in time. I always feed her at this time. Do you think she's too fat? Come here. Please. Wait. Not just any one. The ugliest. - The ugliest? - Precisely. It is called "pharmakós": the sacrifice of the ugliest. Kalí órexi! I saw you before and I wondered if it wasn't time for the next phase. Or do you want to remain a firstling forever? - I'm to go upstairs? - We need someone for the mystery play, to play alongside Siegfried. Would you like that? - But that's Maria's task. - Maria... Sadly, she is no longer up to the role. This task requires someone who will truly lose themselves in the role, who would do anything to fill the stage with light. I saw that light in you today. - Are you sure? - I am sure. But... This task is not child's play. The stage is the intermediate realm upon which we may encounter the gods. If you open yourself to them fully, they can fill you to the brim. But... If you don't take your task seriously, you may bring great calamity upon us all. You must decide. [eerie music builds] [mouse squeaking] [water lapping] - He stood right before me. You can't imagine what that feels like! It's like looking into the light. Like the sun is rising. Suddenly I could imagine what being pure must be like. With the others. Raised up, and at home. - But you're at home here! - He asked me if I wanted to move upstairs. He wants me to be in the play! - But you said if we go up, we only go together! I hope you told him that! - When he stood before me, there were no questions. He didn't give me a choice. He said it was my task. - How can you do this? - Because I'm sick of being down here! - Then get lost! [footsteps depart] [distant door closes] [water trickling] [eerie music] [percussive music] - All that is truly pure rises up to Elysion. The filth sinks to the ground. [water trickling] - If out into the world you go, smear yourself from head to toe. Smear yourself so nice and thick, from head to toe with fat of pig. With fat of pig. [boxes thudding] [engine humming] - We are surrounded by a sea of garbage. Yet with each wave, our rock grows. Nothing can shake us. - Ooh... - Ooh... [clapping] - Bravo, Siegfried! Truly impressive! Maria! Do you know how you look when you eat? Like a pig! [group chuckles] Your mouth goes to the food, instead of the other way round. [laughing] That was a joke. Siegfried, be a good host and pour Irina some of our water. The ancient gods once drank from this glass! - You've never tried it? It's the purest water there is. - It's just water, right? [chuckles] [eerie music] [water bubbling] - So, Irina? The first time is always overwhelming, is it not? Let us welcome Irina! - Welcome, Irina! - Thank you. - We have a ritual here. Why don't you tell us something about yourself? - Like what? - Anything. Something personal. Perhaps there's something weighing on you. Or delighting you. Perhaps you like something better about being upstairs than downstairs? Or worse? [laughing] - Well, the children and the piglets... I miss them, honestly. [pig oinking] But the smell-- - It smells better here! - It does. - Great. [laughing] That's behind you now. [pig oinking] - Go on! - [pig squealing] - [woman screaming] - Stinky! - [gun shot] - [pig squeals] [pig squealing] - [panting] [light music] [wind howling] [cutting] - Did you know that Fust's organs are white? Doctors discovered it, even before his birth. "Ultrasound." They thought their machine was broken, but... It was just Fust. That's why he never gets sick. - [girl chuckles] You're so funny, Siegfried. - I'm glad you're here now. How can we speak of light if we've never experienced the darkness? - [girl chuckles] That trick with the soap bubbles was really good. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, the way you put that thing in the water, and those air bubbles came flying out. Maybe we could use it in our performance? - I'll be doing better things on stage. - Like what? - We'd better start rehearsing now if we want it to be really good. - I wanted to see my brother first. - You want it to be really good, right? To honor Fust. Irina. You're one of us now. [whimsical music] [hissing] [inhales] - Pass it on. - Yeah. - [coughs] - How come they're up there and we're down here, Albrich? - Fust wants it that way. - Fust... Why can't I be Fust? - [distorted] He has very different knowledge. - [distorted] We have knowledge, too. We know how to make the soap! - [distorted] We're dirt, Paul. As long as we're down here, we're dirt. - Without dirt, there's no soap. [inhales] - [distorted] I want Irina back! - [distorted] Irina? She's not coming back. She's doing really well now. [tense music] - [echoes] Paul! [echoes] Stop that! [water trickles] [light gasping] [somber music] - Come on, Maria. Hurry up. Get in the boat. You stink. Dirt to dirt. Dirt to dirt. [motor humming] - You must be Hygeia, goddess of purity. Take pity. A small offering for a poor vagabond... - Do you still think it was a good idea to let someone from downstairs take part? - It's what Irina wanted. - I don't wish to cause you any harm. - What is it, Hygeia? Did Dirt harass you? - Who are you? How do you know my name? - I am Fust... Come to liberate the world from Dirt! - But he's just a vagrant! - Vagrant? No! He is Dirt! Only when we free ourselves from him can we approach the gates of Elysion! - Prove to me you're Fust! - For he who is as pure as I am... is immortal! [knife clicks] Unlike Dirt here! [hurried footsteps] - Stop! Siegfried, you disappoint me. You know who you're portraying! Search your soul. What feelings does the sight of Paul stir within you? - Disgust. Revulsion. It's like staring into a sewer and being met with an infinite stink. Yes, disgust. Endless disgust. - Ah! Bravo. Again. From the top! Go on, Siegfried. Strike him dead! Strike him, it's just Dirt! A pile of rotten... - Shit! Rotten shit! Your shit! I stink so much, I make you all puke! [hurried footsteps] [tense music builds] - Fantastic! - After your brother left, and we were alone on stage, that was magical. - You think so? - Yes. Fust is right. I have to become more pure. Like before... - Before? - Yes, before. You know, I played in Epidaurus. In the Theater of Dionysus, at the foot of the Acropolis. It was pure delirium. - In Athens? - Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides. "For I would not be a man if I accepted the lesser share when the greater share can yet be won." [tense music] I was a real star. People would rip off their clothes and throw them on the stage. But that was more than 2,000 years ago now. - I wish I'd seen it. - Maybe you were there. - Really? - Yes. In a pigsty somewhere, hiding as a slave. - Or maybe you were my slave. [music continues] - Elysion! Elysion! - The stink is approaching. [sharp inhale] [exhales] We are drawing closer to the great performance. - Children, faster! What's taking so long? Come on! - I'm sick of being pushed around. - Shh. Be quiet, Paul! - If you're so brave, prove it. - Or shut your mouth. - I am Fust. Come to liberate the world from Dirt. What's the matter, Hygeia? Did Dirt harass you? For he who is as pure as I... is immortal! [lights click] Who's there? [footsteps] Paul? - You... Dirt! [thud] [water lapping] - He who attacks Siegfried, attacks me as well. What do you have against him? Come on, Paul. You don't need to keep any secrets from us. - He spread Irina's legs and looked inside. - What? - I couldn't see everything, but suddenly he started jerking around and muttered, "Elysion! Elysion!" - And after that, what did they do? - Then I shut my eyes. - Is this true, Siegfried? - I wanted to get to Elysion. I saw it before me. I could almost touch it! - Ah! [inhales] - [labored breathing] - [gasps] - I forgive you. [eerie music] [clapping] [eerie music continues] [footsteps approaching] - [whip] - [grunts] [whip] - Water? - [whip] [water pouring] - [whip] - [grunts] [panting] - [whip] - [grunts] - At least he's not getting a rhaphanidosis. - A what? - You don't want to know. - What an idiot. I am... Dirt. I have come to liberate the world from purity. I am dust, slime, and waste! I am the ground beneath your feet! I am the earth that swallows everything! What are you, Ulca? - I am... Dirt? - And you? - I am Dirt! - You? - Dirt. - And you, Albrich? What are you? Why do you let them treat you that way? - Watch it, Paul. Watch it. - And now everyone. We are Dirt! We are Dirt! - [all] We are Dirt! [all] We are Dirt! [all] We are Dirt! [all] We are Dirt! [tense music] [all] We are Dirt! [all] We are Dirt! [all] We are Dirt! [tense music] [all] We are Dirt! [all] We are Dirt! - [coughing] [muffled chanting] [music continues] [chatting continues] [music continues] [chatting continues] [music continues] [chatting continues] - [whip] - [grunts] - [whip] - [grunts] - [whip] - [grunts] - I wanted to wish you luck for the performance tomorrow. - It will be brilliant. [panting] I will enter the stage like a god! Then we will fly straight to Elysion! [coughing] - Siegfried! - Don't worry. It's just the dirt coming out. It's all part of the cleansing. - [whip] - [grunts] - [whip] - [cries out] - Well, Siegfried, are you ready? - I will give my best. - Do you think it will be enough? - It will be the greatest show you have ever seen. - I believe you, my friend. I believe you. [tense music builds] [deep sigh] - A small offering for a poor vagabond. A piece of bread, a sip of milk. Let me rest on your breast and refresh myself. Take this bread. It is but slightly moldy. And this milk, it is but slightly sour. Good enough for the likes of you. [audience laughs] Who are you? - I am Fust, come to liberate the world from Dirt. Someone as pure as I... No. No, I am tired. I am weak. How can that be? Am I pure enough? Will I ever be? Why have the gods chosen me? How can a single man carry such a burden? How can I win against an element? The fight is already lost. I breathe dirt. With every breath, I become more my own enemy. [echos] My sight dims. The voices in my head torment me. [sighs] For a moment, I believed I'd defeated Dirt. But it is a part of me. Of all of us! [audience gasps] To defeat it, I would have to kill a piece of myself. [sighs] I am no longer afraid. I am both blade and wound. I fight. But Dirt remains. We are all Dirt. [all gasping] [eerie music] [thud] [audience applauds] [ominous music] - [stuttered breathing] [sobbing] [ominous music] [water lapping] - It wasn't me. It wasn't me. - Dirt to dirt. [boy grunts] [engine humming] [engine humming] [wind howling] [somber music] [water lapping] [light music] [gun clicks] - You're filth! Filth is disposed of! - Then do it. Come on. Or can you just kill pigs? [music continues] - I will now make contact with Siegfried. Why me? [light dramatic music] Why now? Why in this cowardly, malicious way? But have no fear, I have arrived. Finally. - I'm glad, Siegfried. What is it like? - There are no lies here, no pain, no misgivings. - [echoes] Only warmth, security, and love that flows through me in an endless river. I am so infinitely relieved to be here. The earlier you can follow me, the better. - First you... now Paul! I don't understand anymore. - [eerie music builds] - [sighs] We have found our calling. And do you know who was liberated by it? [grunts] You. And soon, all of us. [water lapping] [breathing heavily] [ominous music] - [grunting in pain] [labored breathing] [music builds] - [thud] - [gasps] - [light gasping] [tense music builds] [ominous music] [traffic noise] [ominous music continues] [traffic noise] - Hi, Albrich. - Good evening. [dance music thumping] - And you, little man? - He's my colleague. Call him "Dirt." - Hm. [dance music thumping] - [exhales] Eh, eh, eh, eh... Tell your boss this'll be the last delivery. [chuckles] We've got this now. Better and cheaper. From China. The Chinese are taking over everything. [squirting] [chuckles] And it's got aloe vera in it! - Alo-what? - Vera. Aloe vera! Good. I warned your boss a long time ago: Adapt or die. - Come on. - Wait! I've got something to cheer you up. [ding] [percussive music] [liquid sloshing] - So... Are you ready? - I thought it'd be darker. - You have doubts yet again. Ah... Give me the chalice. My father. He left us far too soon. [percussive music continues] [camera flash buzzes] From nothing, he created everything. [shoes clomp] - Thank you. - The factory. [light music] My mother, and me. - First rest it on your shoulder, and... [gun shot] Your turn. Go ahead. First cock it. Very good. [gun shot] Bravo! Well done! Very good! - [both] Siegfried is invincible because he bathed in dragon blood... He takes his sword and chops off the giant's head... - He told me of the Lindwurm, Valhalla, the Twilight of the Gods. My mother told me of Ithaca, the Minotaur's labyrinth, and of Hygeia. - [speaking in foreign] [wrench clangs] [light music] [dramatic music builds] [heavy breathing] - [moaning] - [heavy breathing] - [moaning] - [heavy breathing] - [humming tune] - My father wanted to keep all things pure. That was his only aim. - [humming] - "Beware of the dirt," he always said. "It will ruin you." [bubbling] - [screaming] [water dripping] [echoed water dripping] - Relax. [water dripping] [echoes] Don't be scared. Don't be afraid, Albrich. There's nothing to be afraid of. - Our destiny is revealed to us through pain. I was on the brink of discovering mine. [silverware clinking] - Father, will Mother get well again? - If it is God's will. [whimsical music] [thunder rumbles] - [grunts in pain] My love. Help me. Please. - I was able to save her. - [thunder rumbles] - [faint struggling] - But my father was beyond all help. - [light thud] - [grunting] [thunder rumbles] Bless the suffering that taught you to become what you are. [dramatic music builds] For only when we have lost everything, when everything around us has fallen silent, can we hear the voices of the gods. [dramatic music] That is when I saw Elysion for the first time. [dramatic music] And recognized my calling: To save those who cannot save themselves. I collect the trash and bring it here to clean it. Like you. Like a snake, you shed skin after skin in order to grow. First the old world... Then Siegfried, your brother... And now all the others. - Is it time? - You will give it to them. That is your calling, your role. You want to be a goddess, don't you? Or do you want to stay human? [liquid trickling] [fire crackling] Do you know why Hygeia is what she is? Because she remains pure. [rustling] - Irina? - No matter what she does, no matter what happens around her. [hurried footsteps] [exhales] - [inhales] - [inhales] [digital percussive music] - That's how it is in the beginning. Everything's fruity, fleshy, full of life. But under the surface, everything is rotten. The island is a garbage dump, and Fust is the garbage king. An iridescent fly on a pile of shit. And when he doesn't need you anymore... - Like Siegfried? - Is he dead? You don't know who Fust really is. I was ready to follow him to the very end, but... Now he has... - Irina! - Drink up. I'll bring you another one. [digital music continues] - [echoes] Let go, free yourselves. Purify spirit and body one last time. - [door slams] - [lock clicks] When I shut my eyes, I can already see Elysion. My nose sings. My soul opens up. It is land and sea and man and God. Let us welcome her. Hygeia will quench your thirst. Hygeia, we thank you. - [all] We thank you. [dramatic music] - [echoes] Hurry, my children. Drink. You become light. You rise up. Every molecule, every atom. The weight of the Earth. Everything falls away. - Shall we go? - It's your turn. [female vocalizing] - Are you not coming with me? - From here on out, you must go alone. [music intensifies] [gas hissing] [percussive music continues] [banging] [gas hissing] We now end the performance, and enter the reality of Elysion. [percussive music continues] - Fust... [gas hissing] - [coughing] [all coughing] - Help! Help! Help! - [pounding on door] [whimsical music] - [gasping] - [coughing] [intense music] - [coughing] Children! - [all coughing] - Open the door, dammit! [door rattling] - [all coughing] - [grunts in effort] Children! [somber music] - [panting] - Dirt takes many forms and many names. It infected this island in the form of a small boy. But now that he has departed, this place has become pure. Purified for Hygeia's return, and our last performance. - [chuckles] Come. Come. [groans] Is it not fantastic? Slowly the paralysis takes hold. The brain fades away. Come. Life leaves you, yes! You are purified of life itself! And then... [singing] Fust has come from far away He means you well... And you and you and you... Against the dirt, He'll win the war You must love him evermore [humming] - [grunting in effort] [panting] No! Children! [eerie music] - You must drink now. [sniffs] - You first. - But Hygeia brings the poison. - Don't be afraid. Do it. You must drink now. Huh. - Hygeia! Hygeia! [tense music] [music stops] [vocalizing] - What are you doing? - You didn't want to drink. [vocalizing] - [thud] - [grunts] [groans] [vocalizing] [dramatic music] Finally. The garbage man is here. [gun clicks] [vocalizing] [grunts] [wind howling] Look after my snake, won't you? [groaning] I'm glad it turned out to be you. A worthy end. Irina, live your dream. [wind howling] [thud] [somber music builds] [groaning] Fust has come from far away He means us well. He'll never stray...
