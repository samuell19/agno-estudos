Hello? Hey. You're actually there this time. Yeah, I was just about to head out. Turn your camera on. Are you at the hotel? The WiFi's really bad right now. I wanna see you. I miss you. The girls miss you. Look, I gotta run. I just wanted to let you know I'm all right. Is this our guy? Yeah, name's Victor. - Introduce me. I hear you're training for the National Police Boxing Championship. Rumor is, you're gonna make a lot of betting men rich. - Victor, this is my friend, Akkarat. He like the way you fight. - I could use as man with your skills. - I already have a job. - Hey, trust me, he is someone you need to know. - If you tire of your police work, call me sometime. - How many more hours? - You should know. You've done this route 100 times. - Remind me. - Eight hours. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened? I don't know. Start it. - Ah, come on! - We need to get this truck to The Pearl tonight. They were found in the early hours of morning, just as the sun was breaking over the hills of this remote Thai village. The scene is one of horror. Bodies are strewn about the belly of an abandoned truck where women, and according to local reports, young girls, were left to die. Officials have blockaded the area from international press, but this is what we know. At least 51 migrants are dead, trafficked through the southern border of a country that at least publicly, has committed to combating human trafficking, but this shocking incident raises a-- They drove right across the border. Were there any survivors? Now there's the real question. How many? We don't know, but that's what I'd like you to find out. - I was wondering why your office called this morning. - Maybe I just wanted to meet with someone other than a lawyer. - I am a lawyer. - Not the bloodsucking capital hill type. I need a favor, Marta. - Come in. Hey. - Hi, so handsome. - Are you number 18? - Yes, but you can call me anything you want. - My phone's been ringing off the hook over this incident. - I'm supposed to believe you're suddenly moved by the voice of the people? - I'm meeting with the state department this afternoon. I'm gonna recommend a task force to look into the incident. I want you to lead it. - How big a task force? - Of two. - I may have said anything is better than what this administration has on the ground, but you want me to lead a team of two aides? - Not two. One aide, you and someone else. I envy the poor soul who has to live up to your expectations. - I'm sure this has nothing to do with the president's trade deal. - The state department's report on human trafficking-- - Is the reason this trade deal shouldn't go forward. - It makes things tough enough with our trade partners. And adding this task force could kill it. - Good. - Do you want it or not? - Of course and I have the perfect person in mind to help. - So do I. This is your guy. How long? - I paid for 15 minutes. - Such a short time for such a handsome man. Come here. - No, I wanna sit. I'm not hear for that. - Family man? Yes, but-- - First trip? No. - It's okay, don't be shy. - Don't do that. Please don't touch me, just stay over there. Okay. - I'm not like the other men. - Oh, I see. I go get boss. - Don't do that. - You want girly man? What? - Small boy. - No. - Boss have those too, you should have told me. - I don't want a girly man or a boy-- - Boss can make all your fantasy come true. He let you get back your time. - Please, sit. I don't have that much time. - That's why we should hurry. Boss won't let you take picture. You only paid for 15 minute. - He doesn't have to know. How old are you? - I need extra. If boss find out. - He won't. I brought more money with me. - How much? How much money did I bring? - For the photos. - 1,000 Baht. - 1,000? - Enough for you to pay your bar fee, you could take a night off. Get a little rest. - Let me see. Money first. Oh, sorry. - No, no, no, no. I just want your face. Don't smile. Am I like girl in magazine? - How old are you? As old as you want me to be. What year were you born in? - 2001. - 15. What's your name. - I'm number 18. - What's your real name? - I'm number 18. That's a three minute warning, there's still time. Give a little extra and I make it worth your money. - No. Oh, come on. It's stuck. - You're a handsome man. I can make you a very happy man. A weekend you never forget. - Now I can't go blow all my hard earned money on one girl. I've got a few more numbers to visit. I've already paid. - Hey, boo, how are you today? Aren't you gonna join in? It's not as hard as you think. Just watch. See, if I can do it, you can do it, and I'm old. Okay girls, you have 20 more minutes and then we have to go in for a math test. Okay, okay, 30 more minutes. How long has she been with you? - Nearly six months now. She was one of the girls on that truck. Routine is crucial to our girls here. They have a math test in the morning, so you have 20 minutes at most. - I understand. - Mae is a sweet girl, but she is still healing. You have to be patient with her. - Back for more? - Don't you know what this place is? - Yes. - Don't be scared, I'm clean. You don't have to do that. It's my job. I know. - What do you want? It's okay to look now. - I wanna ask you some questions. - About what? About how you got here. - Ask someone else. - No one else will talk. - You asked the other girls? What for? - I, I'm putting together a story. What story? - I'm writing a book. The other girls wouldn't even let me take their pictures. - Did you tell them about me? I didn't say a word. They were too afraid of the boss. - They're younger. Yeah. - Stupid. Are you? - Stupid? - No, afraid of the boss. - Of course. How much? - Same as last time. - No. More. - How much more? - Another 100 Baht. - I can do that. - You pay all that money just to ask me some questions? You can't tell anyone else what we're doing here. - I won't. - Not your boss. - Are you crazy? - Well, what about the other girls? - Give me another 100 Baht each time we meet, and I won't tell them. It will be tricky to hide all that money. - 100 more Baht? 1100, okay. So we have a deal? - Deal. How long you pay for today? - 30 minutes. Good. The other men, Germany, Norway, Singapore. - Yeah? - If they like a girl, it start like this. Test us out like a car. See which one they want to drive while on vacation. - Yeah, I understand. - BMW, Ferrari. - Yeah, I get it. - You like expensive cars? What kind of car do you want me to be? - Give it back. - I'll take you places you never dreamed. - I drive a minivan. - You never dream of driving a sport car? - You know what? The deals off, I'll find someone else to talk to. - I was only playing game. - I'm not hear for games. - I see that. - I'm here to ask you questions. - Okay. - Nothing else. You got that? - So serious. - There's other girls who wouldn't mind getting paid just to talk. Maybe not in this bar, but there's 100 more in the city. Why go anywhere else, you're already here. - This is my hard earned money, will do what I want. - Anything you want. - Maybe I'll come back tomorrow. You can ask me some questions now. You already paid for 30 minutes with your hard earned money. - Your boss won't be suspicious if I come and visit you again this week? - He'll think you really like me. He'll ask you if you want weekend away at the beach. I bet that's how you make him the real money. - If you have any more question, maybe you will take me to one of the islands. - Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Hey. Hey, I'm in here. - Is she giving you trouble. - I paid for 30 minutes. - Sometimes this one causes trouble. - We were talking. - Talking? - Hey, open, open the door. - He asked you to leave. - You give him what he wants. None of your silly games. Why aren't you working? Huh? - It's not her, it's me. - So young to have trouble. She's not pretty? - No, she is. - What do you want? Yum yum, bang bang, she can do. Or else I can get you a younger girl. - No, no, I like this one-- - Maybe a few girls at the same time. - No, in a few minutes I'll be fine. Just, just leave us alone. - Okay. You take your time. Boss wants you to be a happy man. - I am, or at least I will be. She works for your boss? It's dangerous for you to make her angry, isn't it? I'm sorry. I think it's okay now. Bye. - If you like me after the island, maybe you'll take me with you to America. - Hello, Mae, are you ready for our visitor? Mae, this is Marta. She came all the way from America to visit you. She wants to ask you some questions, but today I thought you should just meet. One of the things we do with the young women here is art therapy. It helps them indirectly address their trauma. Do you like to draw, Mae? - But I'm not very good at it. - I can't even draw stick men. - What's stick men? - See, I'm useless. You should see my stick animals. - Hey, wanna join us? It'll be fun. No thanks. - Hey, Mr. America. How was it? She make you a happy man? - Mamma, whoa. - Did you get my report? - He's spending a lot of time in that one area. - What's going on, Janet? - Our counterparts there wanna put on a show. Send a message that their tough on organized crime. - How come you know about this and I don't. Don't let your boy get caught up in it. - Megan, I'm not gonna ask you again. Mom, just wait. - It's breakfast. - She should be grounded. - Shut up, Sarah. - Hey, don't tell your sister to shut up. - I need to get these moves down before dance tonight. - Megan, I mean it. ♪ Hold me ♪ - Thank you. ♪ Show me what I feel, show me how I feel ♪ ♪ I know you're to keep ♪ ♪ Don't tell me how to feel ♪ - Will dad be back for the recital? - I don't know. ♪ I got none, none, none ♪ - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down my friend, slow down. Come on, sit down, I don't like to drink alone. Hey, Kimmy, two beer each for me and my friend. - One for me. - Ah, come on, come on, what are you some kind of light weight? We're gonna be here all night partying. - I don't have all night, I have to work all day tomorrow. - Ah, so you're a businessman like me. Relax. First time in this place? - Yeah, to this part of the city. I'm still tryin' to figure it all out. - Ah, well you came to the right place. Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you have good taste. There's many more visits. I'm Alex. - I'm Jason. How often do you find yourself in this part of the world? - Once a year, for work, and play. Sometimes twice. The work's government's tough. It's pretty boring, but play. Woo, it's outa control. Have you checked out any of the other bars? - Oh yeah, but I always come back to The Pearl. And who can blame me, right? You see that girl? This one. Yeah, this one right here. Yeah, yeah, I took her virginity last night. We had a whale of a night, man. It was amazing. I had to pay 10 times the going rate, but where else in the world can you do that, right? She's a little nervous at first, but then she really got into it and it was historical. Oh, it was amazing. Better me than some pig, right? So anywhere she goes from now on, she'll have me in the back of her mind, and we had some fun. Oh yeah, it was fantastic. You know what I mean? - I wouldn't know. - Yeah, I'm thinkin' about taking her to the islands with me this weekend. Oh hey, maybe I'll take her. You know what, maybe I'll take both. I don't know yet. I'll figure it out, it'll come to me. Sorry. - What was that, your wife? - No, it's the boss. - Same difference. Hey, I've got a question. - Yeah, well, you keep buying me beers and I'll answer any question you want. - How do you know if they're still virgins? - Oh, well you get 'em to take the virgin test. No, I'm just messing with you. You go see Akkarat. - Who's that? - He's the boss, he's the main man. You go to him, you ask for anything you want. I can introduce you. - That would be great. I'm actually going to party with him later this week. - Yeah? - Yeah, government clients, expensive girls. It's gonna be crazy. Woo! Hey sweet thing, come back here. Come on now. Shake it, don't you break it. It took your momma nine months to make it. Hey. - Everyone. - What's goin' on, Mamma? - Everyone, we're closed. Let's go. - Mamma, what's goin' on? - Come on. - I get a meeting here tonight. - Alex, rain check, okay? Please, go, leave, everyone. - Hey, where are you going? - Please everyone. We're closed. - You need to leave, too. - Let's go, please. - Go out the back. Why? - Bedbugs, we've got to clean the place, all right? Go. - Is that your girl? - Yeah, I guess. - Oh, you got good taste. Come on, their gonna be raiding this place. - Hey, hey, will you set me up with the big boss? - Yeah, let's go. - Yeah, I'm gone. - Keep up. Don't look. - Are you girls okay? Why is your friend crying? - We were on the street when the policemen came. They scare her. - There's nothing to be scared of. - Victor, come on. - We're going to make these streets safe again. Come on, let's go. ♪ Mocked as I fell ♪ ♪ Broken man with his bed in Hell ♪ ♪ Dug my own grave ♪ ♪ I can hear all the voices say ♪ Hi, Mae, how are you today? - I'm fine. - Mind if I join you? I don't care. Don't let me stop what you're doing. So what are you working on? - Nothing. - Nothing? Can I see. - I. - Hey, anything you do will be better than my stick man. - Okay. - Oh, my. Well, you're good. - This is my house. - What a fine house it is. - I miss it. Do you ever draw any other pictures from before? Before you came to this place. - Sometimes. I'd like too see them. - Okay. - Mae. Have you seen this before? - Yes. - Do you know what it is? - Leave me alone. I didn't mean to frighten you. - Get away from me. - Welcome, ambassador. Steven, welcome. - Long time no see. - I trust you had a safe trip. - Well, it's always on the trip back when the jet lag kicks in. - Come. I hope you saved some energy for tonight. - I think I can manage a little something. - Whoa, Steven Mitchell, you low down dirty rotten scoundrel. - Who let this man back in the country. - Woo. - I'd like you to meet a very special guest. - Hi. So handsome. - And what shall I call you? - Anything you want. Wait, wait, wait. Hello? - Jay? Oh, you look like hell. - Oh, what time is it? - It's 3:00 here. I tried earlier, I gotta go pick up the girls from school. - Oh shoot. How are they? - They're good. They miss you. - Hey, where'd you go? Will you slip through the screen just for one minute? Just one? Hey, come on. Hey. - Can you just come home to us forever? Come on, don't do that. It's been raining here a lot. - Are you sure you should be wearin' that? Remember what happened last time we talked. - I don't cry about you leaving us anymore. - No? - No, you jerk. - Jerk? - You heard me. If I do cry, it's about the shear beauty that's surrounding me on my run. - Have the leaves turned yet? - They started. It's beautiful, Jay. It's like, I don't know, running through a forest that's on fire. Spectacular. - I wish I could say the same. It's sweltering here. Yeah? How hot? - Are you getting dressed up for the meeting? - No, I'm going out after. With who? - Jim and Nancy. Don't you remember? Your parents are watching the girls. - Ali, it's your birthday. I am a jerk. No, you're not. - Yeah, happy birthday. - Okay, stop. The weather. So, how hot is it there? - Uh, three, 400 degrees. Yeah, I sweat even when I chew. The only way to escape the humidity is a mall or a movie theater. - That's no good. - I guess some of the brothels have air con, but it's like one big armpit. - That stuff's nasty. How many have you been into now? - 50. How can there be so many? - That's just on one street in one part of town. - How many did you go into tonight? - Three new bars, six girls privately. One was probably Megan's age. A 12 year old, doing what? Tell me. - No, no. You gotta get to school. - I've got a few minutes. - Well, I bumped into this guy a few times, a Canadian. On business with a number of his colleagues, he comes every year. He's a normal looking guy, right? Right. - So you'd think if he was walking down the street at home. He's well dressed, maintained, socks match, professional. But, he's a pedophile? - He pulled me into a booth where a girl no more than 12 years old was riding at a pole in the middle of the table. - What? - She's hardly got clothes on, she's caked in make-up. She's dancing like a robot. I don't wanna look at her, but I can't help but look at her. She hasn't hit puberty yet. Oh, Lord. - So, I'm looking at her and you can tell. I don't know, I don't know, it looked to me like she was terrified out of her mind. But she just kept dancin'. And after a little bit our eyes met and God help me. Babe. - It's like she'd lost her soul. I mean, ripped out of her body. She was a corpse, living but dead. You know what I mean? - I can't imagine. So, what happened? - What do you mean? - To the girl. - What happened? Alex, the Canadian, yeah, he says that he broke her yesterday. Had to be 10 times what you normally pay, but there's nothing quite like getting 'em for the first time, wouldn't you say? - Did you help her? - I just walked away. Well, what could you do? You're there to get evidence. - Exactly. I needed him to rape her so that I can have proof to hand to the judge that this girl's in fact forced to live in Hell. She's forced to have sex with men like him, 10, 15 times a day. - Maybe I don't wanna hear this. - If I had a gun, I woulda blown his head off. Jay. - I shoulda shot him and every other predator in that room. - Jay, come home. They are asking too much of you. You know you have a place waiting for you at my Dad's firm. - Don't. I hate the thought of you in those places, with those type of men. - Hey. Look at me. - I can't let the girls see me like this. - Are you in front of a T.V.? No. - Well, find one. - You sound excited. The president sure is. Known as a popular destination for sex tourists around the world. The raid has received praise and commends of the international community. The lead up to a landmark trade deal. The U.S. trade delegation issued a statement congratulating. - Victor. Cigarette? - I'm trying to quit. - That's right, you're a prize fighter. I admire your self control. - I'm just passing through this neighborhood. - Oh, it's my neighborhood. You know, the whole thing. You know, it's nice to notice, still men like you are working to clean this dirty place up. - Yeah well, we just caught a few small mice today. We have a lot more rats to catch. - They are waiting for your call. - Well, don't just stand there. Come in and close the door after you. Took me all morning to cool this place down. This air conditioner's a piece of junk. - I've got a feelin' about this one. I don't work on feelings. - Well you know that some of the girls ended up at one of the bars on this street. Why The Pearl? - A good source confirmed that the pimp brought girls through the border before. Good. - None of them are willing to talk, but she is. You need to talk to the pimp. - But, if she was in that truck, her testimony could make our case. - If, let's not get ahead of ourselves, Jason. You need to get the pimp. We need proof that he's trafficking underaged girls and then forcing them to service the men at this bar. - You mean pimping minors so perverts rape them? I need him on the record, that's what I'm saying. - I'm working on it, trust me. See him. - Marta, this girl, I think she's the key to our case. I've been developing a rapport. - No. No rapports. She trusts me. - Is that a feeling, too? - I can, listen, I can convince her to testify, I just need to spend a little more time with her. - Time doing what? - I'm the one going into these bars, risking my neck. You're working mostly on your own. - Yeah, I'm well aware of that. I'm the one investigating a case, trying to stop that sort of thing. It happens in this line of work. - Not with me, it doesn't. Well meaning men, overwhelmed, with their defenses down, start getting attached. - You can't be serious. - This is your first case. What's that gotta do with it? - You seem on edge. - I am doing the job that you asked me to do. You seem a little off. - Well, what do you expect? - For you to be on. You weren't my choice, Jason. I want you to know that, and I don't care who your father-in-law knows or what mid-career crisis pushed you out of your pin striped suits and into this thankless line of work, but what I'm asking for is evidence that will be the bedrock of our case. I'm not here to develop a friendship with one of these girls or to be a hero. I need you on that pimp. We take him down, we send a big message. Turn your focus on him. Be smart about it, but get to him. Am I clear? - Absolutely. - Good, now I've got investigative work of my own to do. Hi, it's me. I need somebody from here that I can trust. - Can I order you a drink? No. - What is this about? I need good men like you. Who stay that way. - Is this about Akkarat? - No, it's about you being on the right side. - Come here. Look at me. You're beautiful. ♪ In the morning when it's done ♪ ♪ And all will see the rising sun ♪ ♪ Oh, I'll be there ♪ ♪ Your God, I'll swear ♪ In a very productive meeting with our Asian counterparts, have confidence in the deal, which will offer new market access for the export of import of agriculture. ♪ I'll be there ♪ - Great. But for the service and financial service industries, bottom line, the deal will remove barriers for American businesses to create jobs for American people. Stimulate the economy people, that's what I keep telling you. Stimulate it and whatever comes. - She doesn't wanna see you today. - I feel terrible. I triggered a traumatic memory, didn't I? - You have to be careful, Marta, it's a long road to recovery. - This isn't the way I usually run things. You know that Leslie. - It's just happening too fast for Mae. - I'm getting a lot of pressure from Washington. - Take a look at these. - I have to talk to her again. I came to see you yesterday. Then Mamma said you weren't here. I wasn't. Where'd you go? Oh, what happened to you? - Nothing. Did you try to run away? - I know better than that. Who did this? - Boss threw a special party. It was a long night. - They hit you? Some like it rough. - I'm sorry. - Sorry? That they did this to you. - It was a gift. What do you mean? - Mamma gave me the afternoon off. The other three girls had to work all day. She said you needed time with me real bad. - I was pretty insistent. - Do you like it rough? Make her hurt? - I would never hurt a women. You don't have to hit us to hurt us. - I have a family, with little girls just like you. Can we start? - What happened to your hidden treasure? What else do you have in there? That's it. - No cigarette? - I'm sorry. Chocolate? - This is it. - American magazine? - No, this is it. - Oh well. What kind of question do you want to ask? - Why don't we start with some basic ones like, what's your name? Okay, no names. What's yours? - Jason. - Jason. - Yeah. - You sound funny, what does it mean? - It means healer. My parents wanted me to be a doctor. Can you tell me your age? You know. - I wanna have it on here. You said you were 15, is that really how old you are? - Close enough. - How long have you been here? Maybe six months. - Really? Yes. - How old were you when you started this, when you started this kind of work? - 10. - 10? - Nine. - Nine? - Close enough. I was so bad, I fail every man at first, get boss no money. Scream and kick every time. Pull hair, not always on the head. Back then I was so bad, I was like girly boy. Flat chest, not with much. - And now? Worth more. How much did you pay when you first see me? - 200 Baht, that's five, $6 for 15 minutes. - You see? - What were you doing before this? When you were just a nine year old girl? School. - Did you like school? You're hurt. Last night? - We played game. Someone careful, especially boss. He always have to win. - Is this hard for you to talk about? - I liked it. - What? - School. - Oh. - I was a good student, good at math. I wanted to run a business. What kind? - Sell food, candy, American magazines, drinks, like 7-Eleven. American men always laugh at how many 7-Eleven there are here. - It's true. More than at home. - You wanna own a 7-Eleven? - Maybe some day. - Your family, do you miss them? - My brother, baby sister. Parents? - My father is dead. - I'm sorry. He always had poor health. He was a farmer. - When did he die? - When I was eight. Is your mother dead, too? - To me. - When did you last see her? - After my father died. - You're not Thai. - No. - Where are you from? Burma? Okay, well I can tell you're not Indonesian or Malaysian. Cambodian? So, in Cambodia, before you came here, another brothel. How long? - Which one? - There were others? Where? - Phnom Penh, Hanoi, K.L.. - Malaysia? - Why do you care? You worked in all those cities? - I'm international girl. When one boss get tired of us, he send us away. - How? - Many ways. Tape over mouth, hand tied behind back, lock in trunk of car. Walk through jungle late at night. If there's water, by boat. Sometimes just like normal. In the middle of the day with boss. Like I'm his daughter. On a bus. On a train. - Just like that, huh? - He says, try anything and I'll kill you. - How about in the back of cargo bins? Maybe a water truck? Have you ever traveled from one brothel to another that way? Some girls get more luck. - Do you know anything about that? A passport and a new name. - 18. - You fly in airplanes. - When you came to Thailand. - Go to Australia. - Were you in the back of a water truck? - Fly out of Asia forever. that's what I want. - It would be very helpful if I knew that. - Orange juice and champagne. Maybe you'll take me when I'm old enough. When I'm 18. - 18. Do you know about that? That water truck in Malaysia? You were there, weren't you? You escaped. Oh, God. - What kind of story are you writing? - I'm here to help you. - Give me that. - No, I need this. Hey, I'm paying to spend time with you to get information. I need you to testify. - Testify? - Sh, calm down. What are you, what are you doing? - No one can have this. Any girl who talks about the water truck disappears forever. - That won't be you. - It's no joke. - We know about your boss. No, we know that he bought you, that he forced you to work here. We know about that water truck and how they left you all there to die. - Are you with the police? - No. - Some of the girls thought they came to The Pearl to help, but they didn't help. - I'm so sorry. - They're friends with the boss, too. - We'll make them pay for what they did, and for what they're doing. - How can I believe you? - When people found out about that truck, I was sent to go after your boss. We have evidence, we just need witnesses. We'll make sure you're safe. I'll take you away for a whole weekend. - The beach? - Yes, the beach. You'll never have to come back here again. - Please, take me away from this place. - I'll come back for you tomorrow. I'll arrange it with your boss right now, okay? This nightmare will be over very soon. - Pinky promise? - Pinky promise. - I'll be just outside. - Mae. I brought you something. For your drawings, now you can keep them all in a book. - Miss Leslie said you can maybe stop those men. I'm trying. - From hurting other girls? - Yes. - When I saw your pin, I thought you work for them. Where did you see them wearing it, Mae? - I don't know name of city. - It's okay, it's okay. - It was with my last boss, before I come here. We call them guardian angels. - Guardian angels? - Because they watch the very rich Americans go to the bars. - I want to put those bad men in jail. - Okay, Mae, we are ready. Are you? - Hey, hey, my friend. - Hey. - Perfect timing, perfect timing. - For what? - You're about to meet the big boss. Hang on, hang on. My friend. That guy over there is the one I told you about. He's likes the young ladies. - Hello, my friend. - Well done, Jason. - Welcome to The Pearl. - Thank you. - I trust you're happy here. - Absolutely, this place is amazing. - If you're happy, I'm happy. - Thank you. - Alex, my friend, why don't you go order a drink. Tell them it's on me. - How about a girl, too? - Always, Alex. - Look, I don't wanna offend you. See, honestly I love this country, I just don't love your women. - What do you like? - How about your girls? - Which one? - Number 18. - She's not like my other girl. - Tell me about it, I get turned on just thinking about her. Where's she from? Hey, I'll do what it takes, I'll pay what it takes, just name the price. - For a girl? - Yeah. - 20,000. - For an entire weekend? Where do I come and get her? - Tomorrow, 11:00. - All right. All right. I love Cambodians. Take these girl out as fast as we can to distract, got it? Yeah, let's go. They're dead? Whoa. Reach up your hand, we pull you out. Come on. I need a doctor. We're here to take you to the hospital. - There a lot of people here very sick. - Come on, I got a ladder. Come on, hurry. - Get up. Get down. Come on, hurry up. Get down. Let's go. - Don't worry, it's over now. Help, my friend is very sick. I won't leave you. Stay there. How many more down there? Maybe 60. - How many alive? - Maybe half. - Okay, get the girl who cannot get down. - Where are you taking us? To the hospital, come on. Higher. Yeah, I got her. We have to get out of here now. Leave the rest. You, come on, turn around. Here, get up. I got you. Undo the latch. I said we have to turn tail. - You are not doctor. Shut up. Stop it, don't let them take you. Shut up. Yeah, go, go. Get up. Go. Hey. Hey. - What? - She escaped. Go get her. We gotta go now. Boss gonna kill us. Okay, go. Go. - Looking for this? - That's mine. - Everything in this place belongs to me. Why is the American giving you so much extra money? Huh? - Hey. Hi. My guy is on his way to The Pearl right now to pick up our witness. He's arranged it. She's willing to testify. Listen to me, Marta, there's a real concern the whole trade deal could go sideways. - We have a girl whose willing to risk her life. - All I'm relaying to you is what I've been told. - Are you covering for him again? - Who? - I'm sending you an email right now with photos. I'm not in the office. - Check your personal account. - What am I looking at here? You tell me. - I see Steve. - The U.S. Ambassador. - I see Steve and a few other delegates from the trade mission in a meeting. - A government meeting. These were taken at The Pearl. The scene of the crime, where our whole investigation is taking place. This is a bombshell. - Sorry, hey, whoa, hey, take it easy. - You need to back off. - Of what? - Stop screwing around. You don't know what you're getting yourself into. - You work for Akkarat? - Shut up. - Hey, hey, hey. Ah, ah, ah, take it easy. Ah, don't, ow, easy, easy. Give it back. - Beautiful family. Why don't you stop trying to be a hero and go home to them while you still have a chance. - You can't intimidate me. - I never forget a face. - Especially not a pretty one like yours. - She was like my big sister. When she was with a man, I would go through his clothing. When men were with her, I would take money from their wallet. She did same for me when I was with customer. They never expected anything. Some men are so stupid. We did this for a few months before we got caught by Mamma. She almost beat us to death. She make us give her all the money we had stolen. She was the one who put us in the truck. She act like she is God. She always knows what's happening. - Massage, massage, massage. - Massage, massage. - No thanks. - Body? - No. - Okay. Massage. - Massage. We're closed. Come back later, okay? We'll make you a happy man then. - It's already 11:00. - We had a special event. - I made an arrangement to take one of the girls with me for the weekend. I already talked to your boss about it. - Your little girlfriend isn't here. - I have an arrangement. I'm supposed to come here at 11:00 a.m., take the girl away with me for the weekend, I give you a whole bunch of money and we're all happy. - The plan has changed. - Okay, uh, well just, let me talk to your boss. I spent a lot of money here. - Believe me, we know. If you need time with a little girl, you can come back later. - Did he take her? - Your girlfriend isn't here. She's dead. - You're lying. - Go see for yourself. She slit her wrists this morning. We had to shut the place down to have her body removed. To get all the girls. - Wait, wait, are you saying, you're saying she's still in there? - Nobody wants to touch it, it's bad karma. The boss is very mad. She was one of the whores that was making good money. - She is not a whore. She has a name. - What is it? - She never told me. Did you call the police? - You really don't understand how this part of the city works, do you? Where do you think you're going? - I'm going to get her. We will handle this. - You will get out of my way if you know what's good for you. I will not let her stay one more minute in this god forsaken place. 18. She's gone. She's still alive, isn't she. I'm talking to you. - That cost me good money. - It'll be better for you if you help me out. - How much do you take then? - You can't bribe me. - You're a cop, aren't you? No. - Who do you work for? RJM? The UN? - It's all over. We're gonna shut this place down. - If you shut this place down today, someone will open one tomorrow. Everybody knows that. It doesn't matter. It matters to me. - Go to Hell. - Where is she? - What are you gonna do, kill me? Rape me? - No. - Go ahead, no one can see. - Just tell me where she is. - She's gone. Go inside. - Hey, have you seen 18? - Go inside. Have you seen? - Hey, where are you, you usually don't. Have you seen 18? 18? - Close your doors. Inside, get inside. I will find her. - Hey, don't let him get away. Hey! Don't, hey! Hey, stop! Come on, you took the wrong turn. - Put the knife down. - You come with us. - I'm trying to go to one of the islands today. - And I got a knife. What happened? - He took her or she ran. Someone tipped them off. - I thought we could get to her first. Before who? - I got a call from D.C. this morning. They pulled the plug. - And you still sent me there? Why would you do that? - Because I wanna save 18 as bad as you. They have her? No, we do. - What? - For now. This guy's with us. - What guy? National police. - The police? And you can trust this guy? Why am I just learning about this now? - Look, I don't have time to explain myself. It's getting complicated. - I've gotta go get her. - You're staying here. - Okay, she trusts me. She's waiting for me. - Your cover is blown. Our case is over. Look, maybe I can go and get her. - And what am I supposed to do? - Pray. I can't stay here much longer. I know. - The girl's boss is going to be here soon. He's a very dangerous man. - Is someone with her already? - Mamma inside, you don't have long. - Thank you for what you've risked. - I'll stay as long as I can. - I would always plan an escape. But I never had a chance to run, and was too afraid. Mamma makes it impossible for you to run. She chain the door at night. She lock your door shut. She make sure you cannot run. I remember asking her one day if she was more afraid to live or if she was more afraid to die. She looked at me and smile and she said, I'm more afraid of Mamma. - You are whore and the daughter of a whore. And that's what you'll always be. Excuse me. Who are you? And what could you possibly want with her? - Not everyone in this world is cruel. Whatever you do, don't go anywhere else. - It's time for you to leave. Come with me, please. - Hand over the girl to me and I'll walk away. She'll disappear, I'll disappear. - And why would I do that? Let her walk away, let you walk away? - Because no matter how corrupt and greedy you are, even you don't wanna go to jail. You wouldn't last a month in the hell hole I'll have you thrown in. - Sit down! You should come work for me. We'd make a good team. But you gotta know this. Whether you walk off with the girl or not, I'm not going to jail because I own this place and soon I own this whole town. And as the king of the corner of this city, let me give you a little advice. If I ever see you again, anytime, anywhere near me, near one of my girls, near one of my officers, I'll kill you myself. Why don't you just get it over with now. - Get to the back of the line, huh. Get out of my face! I mean what I say. Victor. - Yeah? - Where are you? - I'm on my way to you, did-- No, you're staying there. - Did you see 18? Yeah, I saw her. - Thank God. She won't be there for long. - What? - Her pimp's there, Jason, we don't have anymore time. Our guy risked his whole career for us to save this girl. This is over, Jason. I'm sorry. He says he has to leave. Once he leaves, she's gone. - I'm going. - You can't afford to be a hero on this one. - You tell that to 18. - I'm ordering you not to go. Jason! - We used to make up story, happy story about our village. About school. We used to imagine there was a man somewhere who would come and rescue us. Sweep us off our feet and take us away. 18. 18. I'm here. - You came. But the policemen, they're dangerous. - They won't be a problem anymore. We don't have much time, we have to leave now. - The American woman, she your friend? - Yeah, my boss. She wanted to help. - When she left, I thought I never leave this cell. I planned to never leave this cell. I lost all hope. - I'm sorry. - But you promised. - I keep my promises. It's clear. Let's go. We have move now. We don't have much time. I'm taking you away. - To America? - Yes. - Why? - I know what they did to you, those men. I will never let a more rough hand violate you. - 18. - Please go back there. How can you live yourself if you don't. Yeah, hang on. How long until we get there? - Five minutes, five minutes. - Five minutes, I'll be five more minutes. - I've been looking for you everywhere. I lost six hours of business because of you. You owe me money. - I owe you nothing. You've taken everything from me. - What do you have when you came to me six months ago? Hm? What do you have when you came to The Pearl? That's right. Nothing. You were sick, I took care of you. You were worthless and now you make some of the most money a girl can make in a bar. You have your own room. I give you nights off. Six more months, you'll be the best girl in the city. Do you know what most of the other bar owners did to the girls who came on that truck from Malaysia? Answer me. - Yes. - And you run away? - I'm sorry. - Where will you go, huh? - Away. - Tell me, what you had that was so much better than what I've given you. - I had a name. - I gave you a name. You're number 18. Do you think there's anyone else out there that will take better care of you of than me? - Yes. - The American? You girls, you're so pathetic. You think one of these white men, lonely and bored on a business trip is gonna fall in love with you? Huh? And then what? Take you home with them? - Yes. And then what? - Live a life. - Tell that to their wives and their grandkids. They're not coming here to fall in love with you. You're just a cheap fix, a fantasy, something to keep them happy while they're here. - He's coming. He promised. - Men break a lot of promises. - I don't want to work for you anymore. - If you weren't a little girl, I swear I'd kill you. But you're worth something to me right now. Do you know what's worse than a dead whore? - No. - A worthless whore. You're beautiful. I'll take care of you, I promise. You're gonna leave the city. - Victor? Thank God you are here. Oh, God. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold it. - I came back. - Yeah. You did. - He took her. - Where? Hey, hey, stay with me. Stay with me, look at me. Where? 18, 18! - We made a pact and we cut our hand with scissors. We mix our blood and we promise each other that we would stay together. But I, I gave her to that man in the truck. I didn't know. It was so bad. I was not careful. The body, the smell. We had to get out. We had to get out. If you see her please tell her I didn't mean to. If you see her, tell her I didn't mean to break my promise. U.S. Ambassador Steve Mitchell was in Bangkok, Thailand today to sign a multi-lateral trades deal that large passenger reports are calling the most comprehensive trade agreement in Asia. Saying it help to to make America's trade size will rapidly grow and is dynamically-- Hey, it's okay. - It's not okay. If I got there a minute sooner, that cop wouldn't be dead, 18. I won't be able to rest, I'll have justice for her and every girl like her. - I've cried a lot of tears in my life, God knows. More than I can count. I don't have any left. But you do. So let them go and maybe, maybe, one of those tears will be the final drop that causes the dam of justice to overflow. Let me know when you're ready. - I'm ready. Hi, Mae. I'm Jason. - Jason. - Yeah. - You tried to rescue my friend. - Yeah, I was too late. - I tried to rescue her once, too. - What do you have there? I drew a picture. - Can I see? It's beautiful. You're a very talented artist. - Do you think she will like it? - She'll love it. - When you find her, give it to her. - There's so many questions I wanna ask you, Mae.
