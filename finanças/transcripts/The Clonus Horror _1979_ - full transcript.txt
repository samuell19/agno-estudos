Hey, it looks good, it really does. - You think? - Yeah, it's great. It looks good. - No kidding, well that went well. We'll be right back. - Yeah, it's a look that challenges people. Good for you, Mike. - Yeah, it says, "I look like this and I don't even care." I say, go man, go! (chuckling) - Well, great, thanks.

Tell them, "Don't not send us the movie that doesn't exist." Yeah, yeah, yeah. - How about guilt and shame? They worked on me. - No, no, no, Mike, kids are fragile but they need structure. Be firm but fair then offer them money. - Nah, just tell them we'll take away their pagers and their big pants and I don't know what else. - Okay, wait, wait, I've got it, okay. Hi, kids, you know, we've always been there for you, working so hard to provide for your future, so don't you dare send us a movie or it'll be the belt for you!

From the first day we met, I knew there was something different about you. - [Mike Deep Voice] There is? - You know what it is? Your eyes. They're so alive. - [Crow] Your nose, so truncated. - You know, I noticed the difference too. I mean, you're not like my friends. - [Tom] You're more icky. - Yours like mine, Richard. Why? - I don't know, Lena, I asked the confessional and it just said that it was all part of the plan. - [Mike] Like Dan Fogelberg said. - Yeah, me too. - Hey. - What? - It's getting a little cold. How about some firewood and a fire? - [Crow] Mmm, she burns good. - [Richard] How long before you leave? - [Tom] Later on. - For America? Oh, I don't know. - [Mike] Watch your head there. - We go when it's time and when we're ready. - Yeah, that's what they tell us. Constantly. Where do you work, Lena? - I work in the (muffled word). - Huh? - Oh, I like it, it's nice. - [Mike] I like the (gibberish word). - Gives me time to write. - Write? - Yeah, I write my thoughts and my ideas. - [Crow] I've already filled a Post-it note. - It was my special place for writing. - It was? - [Tom] I'm not listening. - What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. - Oh, come on, Lena, don't be like everyone else. You can tell me what's wrong. - Big slab. - Richard, we are not supposed to be talking like this. They told me it was not important. - What's not important? - [Crow] My gosh you're ugly. - His name was Allan and we met in compound four when we were 16. - [Mike] When I had a nose. - You know, he's beautiful, Richard. - [Tom] Not like you. - His hair was like the sun and his eye were green. No, he really was beautiful. - [Crow] There was this thing one time, I saw it. Boy, it was really neat too. - I never heard anybody talk like that before. - Oh, I'm sorry, then I won't-- - No, go on. - [Tom] I love it when you talk about your other boyfriend. - He was a friend. I mean, we were in love. - [Crow] Right. - And when it came time for him to go to America, we asked if he could stay. - [Crow] Oh sure, sure. - They said no. And we asked if I could go and they said no and finally they said he didn't have to go at all. - [Crow] Uh-huh. - And? - And he disappeared. - [Crow] Huh? - No one knows anything, not even his roommate. - [Mike] Let's crack the Pringles. - What must be must be. - Don't you get tired of hearing that? - [Crow] They're at EST camp. - [Lena] What's wrong? - I've never heard anyone say that. I mean, I've thought of that. - [Tom] I think. - But I've never heard anyone say it. Everyone here believes what must be must be. - Richard, stop! We're not supposed to be talking like that. - Why? There's nobody within miles of us. - [Mike] I used "agree" today. - You know, you're right. (Tom chuckling) - You know, Lena? - What? - I love it when you laugh. - [Crow] Boy, if only you had a nose. - I like you. - [Tom] You have skin. (pleasant music) - I like you a lot. - [Mike] Look at that, he has really feminine hands. (Crow laughing) - [Crow] Shouldn't we wrestle and slap each other now? (upbeat music) - [Mike] I guess I gotta go a little easier next time. - You know, right before I met you, I found a piece of metal and it had a word on it. - [Tom] Only you can prevent groin fires. - "Milwaukee." And I asked... - Wow. - If it came from America and they said no. - [Crow] Hmmm. - And then I asked the confessional and it said it was a plant from the ocean. - [Crow] She really was on top of Ol' Smokey, huh? (Tom chuckling) - You know, when I was a little girl and I lived in the north section, I saw something. - [Mike] Wow, that's amazing. - One day, I was out playing and I saw one of the guide cars. - [Tom] Really? - And there was something there that was covered, so I was curious and a peeked. - [Richard] And? - [Tom] She looks like Henry Silva in a wig. - I saw one of the older members, Richard. He was very still. - [Mike] She fell asleep on dermabrasion wheel. - [Crow] Ow. - And they said he was asleep, that sleep was very important. But I'll never forget how odd it looked. - [Tom] Do you like paper? - We've gotta find out more. - No. I'm frightened. - I am too. But something's not right. Unanswered questions, Lena, have to be answered. - Richard, no, please. I am frightened, you don't understand that. - It'll be okay. - [Mike] Come on, let's put out our flaming crotches and we'll find your nose. - Hey. Trust me. - [Crow] After all, I look like the guy on "Three's Company." - [Richard] Okay? - [Mike] Is your face made out of clay or... - Okay. - [Tom] Now let's help Jack and Krissy move that couch. (gunshot booming) - Ow! (Mike, Crow and Tom huffing and groaning) - [Mike] Des Moines Olympics are kind of a letdown, aren't they? - Richard. Are you okay? - I'm fine. - [Crow] I'm just a puss. - I see, well you slowed down. I thought maybe it was your ankle or something. - No, I just slowed down. - I don't understand. You can't just slow down. When you're in a race you have to win. - Why? - Why? What kind of a question is that? - [Tom] I'm just your Time Life operator. - Why get involved in a race at all if you're not gonna give it all you've got? - [Mike] Was this an after school special? - I gave it all I wanted to give. I just didn't feel like winning. - I'll have to report this. - To who? - [Crow] To the council of loser clones. - I'll have to report that too. - [Tom] It's starting to stack up. - Can I go now? - Sure you can go. - [Mike] Yeah, report my ass. - [Tom] This is one of the 12 Steve Prefontaine movies being released this year. It's great. - [Mike] "Crotch Fires and You." - [Tom] Let's see, "Jake Cardigan pulled his hovercraft." (ominous music) - [Mike] Did I finish those cheese curls? - [Tom] Doo, doo, doo. (gasping) - [Crow] I'm coming, Elizabeth. I'm coming. Elizabeth, I'm coming. - [Mike] Feels like an elephant clone is sitting on my chest. - [Tom] The James Garner Story. - [Crow] Beef. It's what's for dinner. Oh. - [Mike] Hi, we're your heart attack consultants. - [Tom] Let's get you out on that track, young man. - [Mike] Oh, please be careful. My chalky, spongy midsection. (ominous music) - [Crow] On Tuesdays you get extra prints for free! - [Tom] God, the human body is hideous. - Huh. Well, I can't see anything. - [Mike] You're dull and lumpy inside too. - What did it feel like? - It felt like a burning sensation in my chest. - [Crow] Well, Richard, did you makes a run for the boarder earlier today? - Are you sleeping okay? - Sure, fine. It just happened so quick, I don't know what it is. - [Tom] Have you been eating your boogers? - Let me ask you, Richard? Do you spend a lot of time in the country? - Or down by the river? - No. Why? - Oh, no reason. It's just that the air by the river is not really very good for you. - [Tom] Uh-huh. - We just thought that it might have something to do with it. - [Mike] Am I dead? - What do you think it is? - Oh, just a little attack of the nerves, I guess. After all, you're probably excited about going to America. - [Tom] Today! - Yes. You're scheduled to go in two days. - [Crow] We traded you to Cincinnati. - We were going to wait but you've been progressing so well, we're letting you go early. - Jeez. - Isn't that nice? - [Mike] Ugh. - Great. - So why don't you go and get some sleep, all right? Take these pills just before you go to bed, I'm sure you're not going to have any trouble at all. - [Mike] Can I bring my bike to America? - Okay. - [Tom] Nice gal. - Well, did you hear enough? - He's lying. - [Crow] He looks like an adult fetus. - [Mike] They found my nose! - [Tom] The tight short clinic has been so much fun! - I'm so happy to see you. - [Crow] Allan and I are getting married, isn't that great?! - Lena, we're being watched. - Richard, what're you talking about? - I tried a test last night. I pretended I was sick when no one was around. We are being watched. - Richard, why would they watch us? For what reason? - [Richard] I don't know. - [Mike] Maybe to see if we do that rubbing thing. - [Tom] Let's go pray at the shrine of Dolly the sheep. (wind howling) - [Crow] Are you going to Bobby's America party? - Lena, there's something strange happening here that we're not allowed to know about. - I know. Richard, ever since you and I met, the guides look at me strangely. - Did you see the way they looked at us when we first met? They got angry. - Speak to the confessional. - I don't get any answers from the confessional. I think the only place I'm gonna find any answers is America. - [Crow] Today! - And I'm gonna try and get there tonight. - [Crow] Or today! - But Richard, you're not qualified. - Look, I saw the guides. They took George up to the building in the hill after his party. I think that's a good place to start. I'm gonna try and get in. - [Tom] If my SATs are good enough. - No. - [Crow] You and your big nose! - [Mike] So you wanna take your shirt off now or... - Lena, I have to go. I've got to find out. Don't be frightened. - I am frightened, Richard. I'm very frightened. I'm never gonna see you again. - Of course you're gonna see me again. I'm gonna go to America, find out the answers and I'm gonna come back. - Richard, why? Why do you have to go to America? - [Tom] Today! - Because I have to find out for you and for me and for everyone else. - [Crow] For the baby I'm carrying. - Lena, you can't say anything to anybody. - [Tom] I'll leave you a lump of dough with hair on it to remind you of me. (dramatic music) - Lena. - [Mike] She's trying to start his crotch on fire with her mind. - [Crow] Whoa, there at Chuck Berry's ranch. - [Tom] Aren't these stables phony? (electrical buzzing) - [Crow] Yeah, Secretariat is a personal friend of mine. (upbeat music) (singing tune) - Ah, red! - Hey, that was blue, I saw. - No it wasn't. - You're in the molasses swamp. - I am not. - Yeah, he's in molasses swamp. - [Both] You're in molasses swamp! You're in molasses swamp! You're in molasses swamp! - Mike... - You're in molasses swamp! - You know me. I'm a patient woman. - You're in molasses swamp! - Shut up! Oh, momma, do I need a break. I sure could use that old electronic babysitter right now. So could you guys quick whip up a TV show, maybe one of them public kid shows. You know, educational. You know the kind of crap I'm talking about. (Bobo groaning) (laughing) - Ah, Mrs. Forrester, so you need me and I have all the power. (laughing) Once again you see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away. Too bad. The Havidos could've warned you if only you spoke Havidos. (speaking foreign language) - Ugh. Oh, would you just help me out. Hey, kids, "Satellite of Love" is on. - Oh, I don't like that show, it's dumb. - It's got robots. - Robots are dumb, you're dumb. - I took the liberty of making some fruit leather. - What the hell is-- - [Kids] Fruit leather! (chiming music) ♪ We'll have fun on the Satellite of Love ♪ ♪ Today (giggling) - Hi, kids! - Hi. - I'm Crow the... Cow. (laughing) And this is Tommy the timid tuna, right. - Aaaww. - Today's letter... - A. - A? - [Both] A! (laughing) (clearing throat) - Today's number. - Three. (gasping) - Three? (laughing) So today... Today we learned... - A and three. ♪ Today we learned ♪ A and three ♪ Today we learned A and three (laughing) - I love you. ♪ Today we learned ♪ A and three ♪ Today we learned A and three (giggling) - Moo. - Great, thanks. I'm gonna sneak out and see if I can find a casino on this crumby planet. (speaking foreign language) (cheering) (upbeat Latin music) - Woo! (speaking foreign language) - Agua. Agua. (cheering) (upbeat Latin music) (crying) I'll get you for this, Nelson! (cheering) (upbeat Latin music) (alarm buzzing) (yelling foreign language) (mechanical buzzing) (water bubbling) (beeping) (door creaking) - [Tom] Weee! - [Crow] Super Dave Osborne come to turn down the bed. - 807, secure. - [Mike] Proceeding to number eight to re-pet the bunny. - [Tom] Leave the hall light on! Oh. - [Mike] Well, I'm wet already. - [Crow] I'm gonna get the last of the Frusen Glädjé. (ominous music) - [Tom] The director just points the camera at the lamp and trusts the lamp to carry the scene. - [Mike] I forgot to have my nightly glass of cottage cheese. - [Crow] He's gonna wake up the whole floor and tell them about that damn can again. - [Tom] Sssh, I don't wanna wake me. - [Mike] It takes a dork. - [Crow] You know, everything's so dramatic with him. He's just going to the lavatory. - [Tom] I'm gonna head to the student union and shake a candy machine till a Clark Bar comes out. (Mike giggling) - [Mike] This movie was really a promotional film for UW-Stout. - [Tom] No one knew how to hit the shuttlecock. They're all getting F's! - [Mike] I work for the Clonus Project. We get free coffee. (eerie music) - [Crow] I left my flute in the band room. - [Tom] Ow! - [Mike] Hi, Richard. - [Tom] Yah, yep. - Come on, it can wait five minutes, can't it? I just poured myself a cup of coffee. - [Crow] Now, now, now, Harvey, Harvey. - Yeah, so? - [Mike] You talking to me? You telling me to put down my coffee? - Look, Ernie, it's clear over on the other side of the facility. Have a heart. - [Tom] I'm gonna free Randle McMurphy! - [Crow] He's a nurse's aid that doesn't play by the rules. (Tom singing tune) - Okay. Okay, I said I'm coming. - [Mike] This job ain't worth the free puffy hats! (ominous music) - [Tom] I just authorized myself. - [Crow] I'm gonna amortize the crap out of some of these spreadsheets. - [Mike] Just gonna change my nutritional chart to include more pop. (Mike chuckling) You know, I think they cloned him from Timer, the cheese mascot. - [Tom] Let's face it, clones are rock stupid. (ominous music) - [Crow] Larry Dallas is "The Saint." - [Mike] It might help him at this point if he had an objective of some sort. - [Crow] You know, the truth is out there. - [Tom] Oh, neat. - [Mike] Sure it is. - [Tom] Let's see, "smoking crotch, smoking crotch, "smoking crotch." (ominous music) - [Crow] Gotta see if there's hot dog tater bake on next week's lunch menu. - [Mike] The Clonus Project seems remarkably disorganized. - [Crow] Yeah, they really need to get online. - [Tom] Yeah. (foreboding music) (Tom chanting in demonic voice) (Crow laughing) - [Crow] That's pretty good. - [Mike] What do you know, we aren't at war with Eurasia. (ominous music) - [Tom] As soon as I get to America I'm going straight to Branson! (Mike singing "Mission: Impossible" tune) Marty, we'll march into Masina and I'll sweep down from the north.

I don't understand a thing. - [Crow] Darn. - [Tom] Hey, anybody ever been to Milwaukee?! (Crow chuckling) (Tom shushing) - [Crow] Sorry. (Mike singing "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" music) (military drumming) Rat-a-tat-tat. Old Milkwaukee, Blatz, Hooper, Howenstein, Chief Oshkosh. (footsteps thumping) - [Mike] They'll never know I was here. (somber music) - [Tom] Security, huh? A very complex security system. - [Mike] This is probably the most interest anyone has shown in Milwaukee. - [Crow] He's trying to find a map to the original Cunningham house on "Happy Days." (somber music) - [Tom] "Camp Reject was developed to house all the losers." - [Mike] Wow, this guy's hideous! Oh, it's me. - [Crow] Thanks to Miss Taylor's fourth grad class for transcribing our secret clone notes. - [Tom] Yearbook staff, two, three. - [Mike] They don't need to know this about me. - [Crow] Maybe the ear clip is to trace his migratory patterns? (footsteps thumping) - [Mike] Black helicopter, Roswell, Area 51, Waco, formula for Coca-Cola. (foreboding music) - [Crow] Ah, here it is, "Parts: The Clonus Horror." Should explain everything. - [Tom] I have been wanting to read this book. - [Mike] Great, someone taped "Models Inc." (chuckling) - [Crow] Uh, the network's down. - [Tom] Yeah, I tried that. - [Mike] Well, I'm not waiting up. (foreboding music) - [Tom] Good morning, Mr. Lump. - [Narrator] Each cell in the human body contains-- - [Mike] Hi. - [Crow] Hi. - [Narrator] It is these chromosomes, one set from each parent, that determine who and how we are. - [Mike] Mom, I'm watching cartoons. - [Narrator] Genetic roadmaps. The process of reproduction finds a sperm cell and an egg cell. - [Crow] Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Excuse me, trying to get through. - [Narrator] Joining and reproducing. - [Tom] We've been hit! - [Narrator] The cell is complete, resulting in a separate organism that shares the traits of its parents. - [Mike] Mr. Mutant and Mrs. Freak. - [Narrator] In 1931, we successfully removed the nucleus of a female-- - [Crow] Hey! What's the idea, I was using that. - [Narrator] The replacement nucleus, which contained two sets of chromosomes-- - [Tom] Duh. Duh, duh. Duh, duh, duh. - [Narrator] Resulting in a second organism exact in every respect to the first. - [Mike] And butts were born. - [Narrator] This process has come to be called "cloning." - [Tom] Duh, duh, duh, duh. - [Narrator] Armed with this technology and unlimited funding, we established "Clonus." (Crow laughing) Isolated and secure, Clonus is a breeder facility for clones. - [Crow] Secret. - [Narrator] Each a unique duplicate of a counterpart either domestic or international. - [Crow] And the food! - [Narrator] One of the most serious problems encountered was the suppression of individuality. This problem proved temporary as medical technicians learned that through simple lobotomies... - [Crow] Ow. - [Narrator] These clones could be made benign and cooperative. - [Mike] I like mittens. (footsteps thumping) - [Narrator] Further research led to the perfection of-- - [Crow] Well that was a waste. I didn't find out a thing. - [Tom] Convenient he happened in to the Department of Backstory. (ominous music) - [Mike] No one's guarding my father! - [Crow] He's a renegade mime. - [Tom] Okay. I should be in Milwaukee by now. - [Crow] "Chariots of Puss." - [Mike] Trot, trot for my life. - [Tom] Just his luck, he's gonna get killed by Merv Griffin. - [Jameson] Dr. Nelson, hold that elevator! - [Mike] I can't, it's too big. - [Crow] Nelson. And he bumps right into Bruce Willis. (bell ringing) - [Tom] I think Yoshi parked up on seven. - [Mike] Boy, the water's really good today. - [Nelson] You got here early this morning, Dr. Jameson. - I had to. - [Tom] Rode in with Endora. - A lot to do. - [Crow] Ride the elevator ride at Six Flags Over Texas! (Tom groaning) (Tom gagging) - [Mike] You going to Applebee's for Karen's birthday lunch? - [Tom] I suppose we have to. (Mike groaning) - [Crow] This is what happens when Ottis Elevator sponsors a movie. Hey, hey, stop it! - [Mike] Ah, don't do that. - [Tom] Bill Muscleman, Private I. - This is Davis in records. There's something wrong, we've been busted into. Sound the alert. - [Mike] I hope he never becomes the naked prey. - [Tom] Yeah. (alarm buzzing) - [Mike] You turn the light on. That's why you're my assistant. - [Crow] He didn't fluff! - I don't care what it takes. We gotta find it and get that tape! - What'd they say? (Tom singing "Mario Bros." theme music) - They'll find it. What're you worried about? It can't get away. (foreboding music) (Tom growling) (Crow whimpering) - [Crow] It's the map of the shopping district in Des Plaines. (Mike chuckling) (Tom whimpering) - [Mike] A member of Mummenschanz is on the lamb. - Oh, they're watching the "Mondrian" channel. (Tom giggling) (Mike whimpering) (exciting music) - [Tom] Maybe have to rethink their $11 security budget. - [Mike As Woody Allen] "He's running through "fields of wheat." - [Tom] "Wheat." - [Crow] "Plenty of wheat." - [Crow] Lou Rawls is "The Equalizer." - [Tom] Kind of a weird biathlon. (gunshot booming) Ow. - [Crow] The bullets caused the Kettle Moraine. - [Mike] I feel disappointment that I was shot. - [Tom] There, there's the flavor! - [Crow] Let's get our trained gnats after him! - [Mike] Gentlemen, we have a soft, lumpy target search. (suspenseful music) - [Guide] He's been hit but not stopped. He's headed toward the outer perimeter. - [Tom] Pew, "ow." Pew, "ow." Pew, "ow." Pew, "ow." Pew. - [Mike] I'm starting to think Peter Graves didn't invest much time in this movie. - [Crow] Oh, he jumped right into the soylent green factory. - [Jameson] He's over the fence! Damn it! (computer beeping) - [Tom] Would you stop playing pong back there please? - Mr. Walker! - [Mike] Mr. Texas Ranger. - A clone has escaped. - [Tom] Pew, "ow." Pew, "ow." Pew, woo, "ow." Pew, "ow." Pew, "ow." (Mike laughing) Pew, "ow." Pew. - [Crow] He's taking a lot of hits. (foreboding music) Oh, I bet they're filming a truck commercial up there. - [Mike] Look how many time a coyote fell off that. - [Crow] I am Kurock. (whining) - [Tom] Wow, this is one tough hole. Do you think? - [Crow] Do it! - Yes! Jump! - Jump! - Jump, do it, come on! - Come on! You want to! - [Tom] Yes! - [Crow] Jump! - [Mike] He walked right into Golan Heights. - [Crow] Think how many new things there are out there for him to not understand. - [Tom] I'm dreaming about Pep Club. - [Mike] I hope I get the part of Chrissy. (Crow snoring) - [Crow] You're late for Econ! - What's the matter? No! - [Tom] You will enjoy our free continental breakfast! - [Mike] He blends right in with the dimwitted, overly-armed southwest. - [Crow] Oh, the Ravenite Social Club social club. - [Mike] It's the all white version of "Salaam Bombay." - [Crow] This isn't exactly the naked city. It's the clothing optional city. - [Tom] There's gotta be a clone counseling center around here somewhere. - [Mike] Watch, he'll run into Chauncey Gardiner coming the other way. (Tom laughing) - [Tom] Hi Sanford, hi son. - [Crow] Wow, the arcade's kind of under stocked. - [Mike] "Don's Pinball Machine." - [Crow] James Galway owns that porn theater. - [Tom] "Oh, come right in and enjoy some wholesome porn." (traffic commotion) - [Crow] It's Juan Epstein. - [Tom] Hey, Lionel. - [Mike] Is that Harley Davidson or the Marlboro Man? - [Crow] Can't tell. That's Peter Fonda. - [Tom] Gary Busey. - [Mike] Malcolm Forbes. - This is Unit Two. I'm pursuing. All right, 10-4. - [Crow] This is "Then Came Bronson," over. (foreboding music) - [Mike] Ow, over. (motor rumbling) - [Tom] Pew, "ow." Pew, "ow." (Crow laughing) - [Crow] Even though I've never seen one of these things, I'm completely terrified! (Tom whimpering) Watch it! - [Mike] Big tombstones for the big and tall man. (exciting music) Hey, I just wanted to tell you your zipper's down. (gunshot booming) - [Tom] Ow! Ow! (Mike chuckling) - [Mike] Hi, how are you? My name's Richard. Can I borrow your bike, that's really nice of you. - [Crow] Gotta get to the sculpture garden. - [Boy] Hey, come back with that! That's my bike! - [Mike] Pacific blue afternoons. - [Crow] Join us for the East LA Fun Ride. (Tom whimpering) - [Tom] Oh, the garbage ran in front of me! - [Mike As Pee-Wee Herman] "I meant to do that." - [Crow] UPS man, down! - [Tom] What is he doing?! - [Mike] Ew. - [Crow] Stop it! No heaving, thrusting or splaying! - [Mike] Honey, we got mimes. - [Tom] You wanna of them perverts? - Hey, fella. - [Crow] Go suck someone else's garbage. - You've been through some really heavy scenes. Come on, I'll give you a hand. - [Mike] Trust me, I'm Keenan Ivory Wynn. - There's nothing to be afraid of. Come on, I'll give you a hand. Come on, you're all right, everything is fine. Come on! - [Tom] He talks like Ruth Gordon. (Crow whining) - Good Lord. - [Crow] Oh boy. - He isn't hurt, he had a bike accident. Just get some hot water. - Oh, I will. Oh my gracious. Take him in there, take him in the other room. - [Mike As Aunt Bee] "Andy!" - Sit down here. Perfectly all right. - [Crow] Soon as Tanta Kringle gets in here, we'll get started. - [Woman] There you go. Oh, wow. - [Richard] Can you help me? They're after me and I've got to find my-- - Oh, hush now, here. - [Tom] I'm just gonna pour ammonia in your eye. - Anna will talk your leg off while she's fixing you up. - He says I talk too much but I don't. Oh. - [Mike] You are a hunk of man. - Try to get a word in edge-wise around him. - What is that? - What? - Right there, what is that? - Oh, Jake, that's an earring. They're all wearing them. - [Crow] That means he's a friend of Dorothy. - Will you help me find my other part? - [Tom] Help you find Arvo Pärt? - This part you keep talking about. - [Mike] Wow, that is one sexy bun. - [Crow] Yeah, her hairstyle's cute too. (Mike chuckling) - [Tom] 53 hours of AOL?! - This is your father. - Let's see that. Let's see it. - All right, dear! - I would like to. - [Crow] Good improv. - [Richard] I don't know who he is. I only know I'm his clone. - Clone? Clone, now where have I heard that? Clone. Oh, I just-- - [Tom] Well. - Jake, do you know what a clone is? - Just keep quiet for a moment, will you, Anna? - Everybody knows what a clone is. Let me see, I was reading in the Digest the other day. - [Crow] Think. - [Anna] And there was an article about-- - [Jake] Anna, would you just-- - [Anna] Tadpoles! - Look, I broke into the main building. I got that paper and the records of all my friends. You know what they're trying to do? I can prove they're trying to kill-- - Sonny, sonny, please. Just keep it down. - [Tom] All the double-wides in LA, he hold up with "The Lockhorns." - The place. - [Mike] A face inspired by a tuna melt. - Clonus. - [Crow] Oh, the horror down the street, sure. - I'm going to help you find your father. Now, I'm a newspaper reporter. - He's retired. Forced to at 65! - I am a newspaper reporter! You don't have to tell me right now who shot you. - Yes, well you just leave him be, will you, Jake?! Now, let's look at this address. - [Mike] Keenan Wynn is Jack Perkins as Mr. Food. - Well, I can tell him how to get there. - No you can't tell him how to get there, you're going with him, right now! - Anna. - What? - [Crow] If you weren't pregnant, I'd leave you. - Don't you think he's maybe a little... (Crow whimpering like a puppy) - Won't you take me to find my other part? ♪ Won't you take me to find my other part ♪ - We will! - [Richard] Will you take me now? - [Tom] Whoa! - Yeah, I'll take you. - Well, at last. If he didn't, he'd never hear the last of it. Well, don't sit there, go. - I'm going! I have to put on a necktie and a coat. - [Crow] Do you realize how much I hate you?! - Jake! (upbeat music) - [All] Whoa! - [Mike] Oh, why? - [Crow] "Agua." - "Once we killed with stone clubs." - [Crow] Richard Harris as Robert Bly. - "Now we kill with atomic bombs." Period. Paragraph. - [Mike] And erase it all. - Are you through yet? - Why, do I bore you? - Today, yes. - [Tom] Everyday, yes. - What about the idea of taking today off? No dull philosophy for you and no boring speech writing for me. - You bored campaigning with your Uncle Jeff? - [Crow] Mark Spitz and Michael Caine at home. - [Mike] Oh no, no, no, oh. - [Crow] Oh boy. Stay. - [Tom] Don't. - [Mike] Oh, we've found it, this is the horror. - [Tom] Stop it! What have we ever done to you? - And you try to blind those who cannot see. - [Crow] With your shrink-wrapped batch. - That's a good line. Using that in the class? - [Tom] A bad version of "Prick Up Your Ears." - Who's red? - Me. - Excuse me. I beg your pardon. Mr. Richard Knight? - Yes. - [Crow] The neighbors have got together and bought your friend a robe. - Richard Patrick Knight? - [Richard] You have the advantage on me. - I'm sorry. My name is Jake Noble. - [Mike] Napoleon imitator. - I wonder if I could talk to you in private. - This is my son, Rick. We can certainly speak in front of him. What is it that you want? - [Tom] To cover his parts. - Oh, I have your other son. - Other son, what're you talking about? What other son? - The one who was shot. The one who keeps talking about Clonus. - Look, Mr. Noble, I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want but I've got a lot of work to do and my son, here-- - He's right outside. - [Crow] Let's show him what he's won. - But I don't have another son. - Oh, really? Well then how do you explain this? - [Mike] I got out of my car seat. Oh, and you need to change me again. - What is this, a joke? - [Tom] Are you a clown, do you amuse me? - [Mike] Another Scott Baio. - [Tom] Wow! - [Crow] Did the guys at the office set this up? - Who are you? - I'm you, Mr. Knight. I'm your clone. - [Tom] Oh, that's right, I ordered one and forgot. (ominous music) - [Walker] Don't tell me that. - [Crow] It's dirty. - [Walker] Damn it, why am I paying you all of this money for security? I don't care what it takes. - [Mike] We should get cubicles. - [Walker] If you can't handle it, I've got people who can. Now I don't have to remind you what could happen to you if that tape got into the wrong hands, do I? - [Jameson] No, sir. - [Walker] Well do I? - [Jameson] No, sir. - [Tom] Well do I? - [Mike] No, sir. - [Walker] I knew you'd see it my way. - [Crow] I thought it was skin cream but it was Elmer's Glue. - [TV Narrator] An ongoing and self-supporting institution of service and research. - [Mike] At Oral Roberts University. - That's incredible. - Difficult to believe is more like it. - [Tom] Will you wipe me, clone daddy? - Get up! - [Jake] What're you doing? - [Mike] Oh. - [Old Richard] He is a clone, my clone! - [Crow] Ugh, like the movie wasn't horrible enough?! - Someone took bits of you and created a duplicate. - [Mike] Are you mad at me, clone daddy? - Damned if I know. - Now this place you keep talking about, Clonus. - [Tom] Is there a bar? - Is everybody from there a clone? - No, they're all my friends and then there are the guides and the doctors and that's all I've ever seen on Clonus. - Why? Why Clonus and who's doing it? - [Ricky] Where is Clonus? - I don't know! I am confused! - [Crow] Put me in my Johnny Jump Up! - I ran a long ways. And then I came up to the boulders and I looked down and this is what I saw. - If he escape from Clonus. - [Crow] Yeah. - Somebody is probably looking for him right now. Jake? - [Mike] A nice roast beef sandwich with horseradish on it. - Well I hope you're right. - [Tom] Do you cry a lot, clone daddy? - We better proceed as if nobody, nobody else knows you exist or where you are. - Professor. You know that tip will blow the lid off of everything? - [Crow] Speaking of, where's the bathroom? - [Ricky] Yeah but what're we gonna do with it in the meantime? - I'll take it home. - [Ricky] You? - [Mike] I'm gonna tape golf over it. - I know where to keep it. - That's good. Rick, is Jeff at home? - Sure. (Mike, Tom and Crow laughing) - Fine, I wanna speak to Jeff and meet him somewhere. This whole thing is probably something the public is not supposed to know about. Jeff may have heard of this place, Clonus, and can fill in some of the empty blanks. - I don't think so, Dad, because I know just about everything that's going on with Jeff. - [Tom] Uh-huh. - Professor, are you talking about the Jeff Knight? - Senator Knight's my brother. - That's very interesting. - Yeah, well, he'll know if anybody will or know he'll know how to find out. I'm going to try to call him. - We'll go take care of everything, son. - [Tom] And they all head into the closet. - [Rick] Looks like you could use some new clothes. Let me get you some. Does your shoulder hurt? - [Crow] Let me get you some boot-cut jeans, some mesh cut off tees and some tight cargo shorts. - [Tom] Hey, short time companion. - [Rick] You look so sad. Everything's going to be all right. - [Crow] So, you're stupid, hideous, ugly and repulsive clone, so what? Ugh, boy. - This is not my world. - [Mike] It's a marshmallow world. - I am so alone here. - [Tom] Well, there's the Ropers and Jack Tripper downstairs. - [Mike] Hello? - [Crow] Grandma's back and she had Ensure. - Rich, hey! - [Tom] There he is. - Sorry I'm late. - It's okay, thanks for coming. - Oh, well, you know, trying to get away from the campaign. - Sorry, sorry. - I hope Rick's taking the day off too. - He sure is. - [Tom] Peter Graves movie bookend. - This supposed clone you mentioned on the telephone. - [Crow] Is he cute? - Where is he? - My house, why? - [Mike] He's need for "Biography." - Well, because this is big. It's really big. Is the tape at your place too? - How did you know about that? I didn't say anything about a tape. - Well, I just assumed. Everything's on tape today, isn't it? - No, you didn't assume, you know, didn't you? - [Tom] All right, draw. - [Jeff] Yeah, you saw the tape? - Yeah and it's scary. - [Crow] Adam Sandler's in it. - All right, you know part of the story, there is such a project. - [Mike] On "Biography" tonight on A&E. - It's still in the experimental stage. - [Tom] It's called "Biography On Ice." - But the fact that you know about it leaves you sitting right on a keg of dynamite. - [Mike] Oh, hey, and remember to watch "Biography." Paul Lynde, tonight. - [Crow] Climb aboard "The Monkey Business." Donna Rice is waiting below deck. - [Tom] We have brainstormed a lot of good biographies on this baby. - You're gonna find this hard to understand. I know I do. - [Mike] You can't be on "Biography." - The whole thing is about organ transplants. - What? - That's right, hearts, kidneys, lungs, all that. - [Crow] Thumbs, elbows, nasal hair. - If a person needs an organ transplant, his clone, which is an exact duplicate of him, can provide him one very easily. - They're used for transplants for who? - Well, obviously not for everyone. It wouldn't be practical or economical. - [Tom] Or Republican. - I see, for the select few. Those the politicians decide. While you try to create a master race. - Consider the possibilities. Supposed Einstein had lived. Suppose Churchill or Roosevelt had been able to live for nearly 200 years and still function for the world! - Or Stalin or Hitler. - [Crow] Yeah, right, exactly. - Ever since we were little kids, you've been doing that knight on a crusade. There are a lot of things more important. There is the good of the people. - Good of the people?! - [Tom] "Good of the people! Good of the people!" (Mike laughing) - He's been shot! You're telling me that's for the good of the people? - [Mike] Fine, then you host "Biography." - Using that boy for transplants is premeditated murder. Those people are being kept prisoner for a specific purpose, which eventually leads to their death! What happened to their human rights? What? - Well that's exactly the point. Human rights. Clones are not humans, they're things. - They're people! Exactly like us! - No they're not. If it weren't for us, they wouldn't even exist. - [Tom] On "Biography." - You're playing God. Jeff, that's wrong! - The ultimate intention is to help humanity, Rich. - Then why keep it a secret? - Because as soon as the word got out, you know what would happen, people would start yelling "corruption and evil." They'd condemn the idea of immortality as being against the purpose of creation. (Tom mimicking ape) Or some nonsense like that and you know what they'd really be saying? - [Mike] Bite me! - "Why not me? Why can't I have one?" - Now this can't be kept secret. It's legally and morally wrong! (rumbling) (beeping) (mechanical buzzing) (chains rattling) (thudding) - Hey, what's going on down there, Mike? - Well, the kids asked Mrs. Forrester a difficult question, so they're having a serious talk. You know, "that" talk. - Ah. Kirk versus Picard, huh? Yeah, that's a tough one. - Yeah, exactly. - Oh, the facts of life. Don't you kids get the "Spice Channel?" - I believe it was a mediocre sitcom of the 1980s starring Charlotte Rae. Anyway... - Now wouldn't you rather have Tanta Bobo show you how to use a stick to catch some yummy, crunchy termites? - No. - Okay, okay, here we go then. - When two brains love each other, they may decide they want to share the same brain pan, as it where. - Every chick for herself, that's the real facts of life, cookie. If he wants to dance, he's gonna have to pay the band. He wants to paint the house, he's gonna have to buy the enamel. And the primer. And you still might wanna consider aluminum siding. - Grandma Pearl, I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm not sure I do either, darling. But if he wants to sod the lawn-- - Yes, lad, love is kind and tender and delicate. The gentle pleasures of two people connecting in love are many. Love is a sort of gossamer beauty and ignore it! Thankfully we've moved beyond that nonsense. - A really good mate's gonna be able to outrun you for a bit but just grab hold of one leg and hang on tight, you're gonna get kicked, that's always part of it. And an advanced tool user's probably gonna nail you with a few rocks. And there are always rivals to fend off. That's why we have the full charge. Now I'm gonna demonstrate, so don't worry, don't be scared. Just watch me. (growling) (gagging) Good boy, you'll go far. (chuckling) (upbeat music) - If I need another heart, what am I supposed to do? - [Tom] I blew all my "Biography" money. Went straight up my nose. - That heart operation I had two years ago. The heart came from my adult clone. It's exactly the same as my old heart only younger and stronger and without it, I wouldn't be alive today. - [Mike] In fact, I'm not. - My new clone is just a baby. - [Rich] Now wait a minute, you have two? - [Crow] Clone hog! - I plan to be around a long time. And, Rich, I am offering you a gift certificate to life and you turn your back on me. Your my brother and I love you. Do you know the strings I had to pull to get you cloned? - [Rich] How did they clone me without me knowing it? - That's easy. All it takes is one body cell. It happened almost 30 years ago during one of your physicals. Rich, this is your chance for immortality. You don't have to worry about dying because there is a duplicate of you. And if you don't believe it, go back and take a look at that clone you have. Its been conditioned for 30 years to make sure that you and I stay brother for a long time. - [Tom] Mom says hi, by the way. - [Mike] Well, I've had my eye on a new spleen. - I have to think about all this. - All right. All right, you do that. Because there are people who will do anything to make sure this is kept secret. People I can't stop. - Jeff, I really have to think about this. Some of the things you've said are well taken. (Crow and Mike laughing) - All right, then you go on home, keep him there. - [Mike] Nice boom mic. - [Crow] I'll order you up a gross of clones in the meantime. - And, Rich. - [Mike] Sorry I made you eat paste. - Keep it capped. Even I'm expendable if it means keeping Clonus alive. - [Tom] So what happens if your clone is a hard drinking, hard living clone? - [Crow] Sorry, we need your liver to keep your clone alive. Sail away! - [Tom] I want my Teddy Grams. - [Rich] Where is he? - He's asleep and Jake went home. - Ah. - [Crow] Sure. - What did Jeff have to say? - [Mike] Well, "Biography" continues to do well. - He said he'd look into it. - He hadn't heard, huh? (crying) - [Crow] I wet another bed. - [Rick] Well, maybe we oughta call the papers. - [Tom] Meatloaf sweats less than this guy. - We have to help him get back. He misses his girl. He's just like us. - [Mike] Oh, wait, that's not just like us. - No he's not. - [Mike] Wow. - [Rich] He's a freak of nature. - [Crow] Could you turn down the heat? It's like 90 in here. - [Rich] I'm just saying, whatever's going on is out of our hands. - [Tom] Can I watch "Lion King" again? - No, Jeff thinks it's all a ruse. Nothing to get seriously concerned about. It's just something that's.... (Tom slurping) - If you're not gonna call the papers, then I'm gonna do it. - [Mike] I'm calling Michael Flatley. - Damn it! What is going on?! (Tom laughing) - [Rich] I can't tell you. Honestly, son, please, now I can't tell you. - [Rick] You turned him in, didn't you? - [Tom] You're getting divorced because of me! - Richard in, didn't you? - [Crow] Sure! - No, I didn't. I just talked to Jeff and he told me the whole story. He said do nothing and he'll take care of it. - [Tom] So you're not taking me to the Harlem Globetrotters. (Tom whimpering) (Mike laughing) - All I know is you're talking crazy. - [Mike] And I'm the posture prince. - No I'm not. - [Crow] I can't smoke chocolate, I know that now. - Maybe because you're young it sounds that way. But when you grow older there's a definite scheme to things. You're born, you run through life, you wear out, you die. - [Tom] You have one illegitimate son. Oh, dang! - So? - So, Clonus. - [Crow] Walks into a bar and he-- - I don't get it. - [Tom] I'm not done. - So Clonus replaces what's warn out. - [Mike] Did I eat all the Kaboom or is there some left? - [Rick] Have created this clone farm, an organ bank, right? - What's wrong? - [Crow] With my line read. - With wanting to live? - [Tom] Nothing, unless it's you. - You murder to do it. - If they're not really human. - [Crow] He needs to be damp mopped. - [Rick] Dad, he's a human being. - [Rich] No he's not. - [Mike] He swallowed his lips! - [Tom] Wow! - No! I'm just like you are! - [Mike] Isn't that horrible?! - [Crow] Duuuh. - [Mike] Hey, a "Testosterossa." - I wanna go back! I have to go back. - I wanna help you. - No. - [Tom] I just wet your car. - Listen, I wanna help you get back. - [Crow] I'll lend you my low-rise pants. - Trust me. - [Mike] Is this starting to feel funny to you too? - [Tom] There's a stirring in my little clonus. - [Crow] Oh, why don't you kiss him instead of holding him to death?! - [Mike] Now pull your top down and pretend this never happened. - [Tom] "Clonus: The Boys In the Band Horror." - [Crow] It's official, Dad, we don't know what you do for a living. - You're gonna have to help us or you're gonna have to kill me! Because there's no way I'm gonna keep quiet about this. - There's nothing I can do! It's out of my hands. - Didn't I hear you say just this morning that we're all morally responsible for all of our acts? - [Mike] Ah, you kids with your morals and your ethics and your 8-track tapes, aaaah. - All right. All right, go. - [Tom] And never darken my towels again. - Quickly. - [Mike] Thank you, Sir Dad. - I'll take him back while you call the newspapers. - I'll do it. Son, be careful. Careful. - [Tom] Okay, bye, me. (Mike laughing) - [Mike] "Starsky and Clone." - [Tom] I wanna know if they're gonna listen to BTO. (engine rumbling) - [Crow] And Abraham drove Issac to the top of the mountain. ♪ One more clone up in the canyon ♪ - Damn you! - Sorry. - [Tom] As long as they're here, they should've filmed in a cloud. - I don't care about anything right now. Just Lena. (faint speaking) - [Crow] I can't hear what they're saying and, frankly, I don't care. - [Mike] Sorry about our pants toughing earlier. - [Tom] The clone is tagged and set free in its natural environment. (dramatic choir music) - [Crow] If you have to take a pee, I'll just turn around! - [Mike] Where am I going again? - [Tom] The Bulgarian folk choir. They arrived in limousine. - [Crow] Well, thanks for that liver, guys, that was really nice of you. (crickets chirping) - [Mike] Hey, my clone's doing all right for himself. - [Tom] Door-to-door "Biography." I'd like to tell you about the fascinating life of Charles Grodin. - Rich, we have to talk. - [Crow] Some coffee for your thugs? - You might as well tell us now, there is no backing out. - I've already told you, I don't know where he is and I don't know where the tape is. - [Jeff] No, you're lying to me. - [Mike] I'm gonna have Barney rough you up. - You're not sure, are you? So you might as well tell these gentleman to kill me. That's what they're here for, isn't it? - Rich, I told you there were people I can't stop. - Besides, if you kill me, you only have a couple new parts, right? - [Tom] The Sansabelt Murders. - How does that work? Can you do that? Reprogram my mind so I that I won't cause you so much trouble. Maybe even dance at your inauguration. - [Mike] Huge lamps of the '70's, tonight on "Biography." - Is it really worth it, Jeff? When did you change? - [Crow] Dressed like a liquor distributor. - It is worth it because I'm going to be president. - Oh. - [Mike] Oh, you'll be president, my butt. - Jeff Knight, the people's choice. - [Jeff] Damn it, where is the tape? - I don't know, truly, I don't know. Maybe it's on the way back to your clone farm. Maybe it's on the way to the newspapers, who knows? - [Tom] Smack on him! - [Crow] Sit on his head! (Rich groaning) - [Mike] Oh, you're gonna write "dork' on his forehead. - Cain raised up and slew Abel. - [Tom] It was kinda like this because you're my brother, get it? - It's Pentothal, I want the truth. - [Crow] I prefer Jack Perkins, there, I said it! - That's a little too sophisticated for you, isn't it? Who gives you your orders? - Shut up! - Certainly, after all, you're only doing your duty. Someone threatens your spare parts bank, destroy him, it's clean, simple, neat! - [Mike] Close to all the shopping. - Shut up! - [Tom] He's going to be a bigger problem then Billy Carter. - [Crow] Mistakes were made, brothers were killed. - [Mike] Shoot, Mom's home! (upbeat music) - [Tom] Sure! - Ricky, get out! - Dad! - [Crow] I'm home. - [Tom] Give me your posture medal! (groaning) - What're you doing? Ridged! - [Crow] "Ridged?" - Leave him alone! Ridged! - [Crow] Ribbit? Frigid? (bubbling) - [Tom] You dead yet? - I don't know! - [Mike] Cut it out, you booger! - [Tom] I think they found the outrage. - [Crow] This is our pool! Notice there's no pee in it! (electric guitar music) - [Tom] Soundtrack by Yngwie Malmsteen. - [Mike] For God, Country and the Queen! - [Tom As Old Woman] Boys, not in the house! - [Crow] This is about a lot more than super secret government clone projects. - [Mike] Ah, kill and release. - [Tom] Secret service is out from having a smoke. - [Crow] Tonight on "Biography." (Crow groaning) - [Mike] He's not done. The poker didn't come out clean. - [Tom] Quick, rig the shag carpeting! (foreboding music) - [Crow] Can I have a wet nap? - [Mike] Dale Evans wants her shirt back. - Well, that's that. - [Mike] Turned on the gas. - Whatever the hell they're called. - [Crow] Mimi-skirted Grandma. - It'll soon be over, I made sure of that. - [Tom] Oh, and happy 50th anniversary. - You know, I've been sitting here thinking about that young man. - [Crow] If I was 80 years younger, I would just. - If everything they say about how he was born was true, sure takes the fun out of it. - Why, Anna, you salty old lady. - [Mike] And I mean dehydrated. - No, but I'm not dead yet. - [Tom] Soon though, right? - He will be all right, won't he? He has his whole life in front of him. - Anna, he will be fine. - [Tom] Oh boy. - [Crow] Here we go. - That nice boy is taking him back to his girlfriend, everything's gonna be fine. Don't worry about it. You mind if I just read the sports page? - [Tom] Hunker down. - [Crow] Just generic... (explosion booming) (screaming) Forgot about those cookies, sorry! (Tom laughing) - [Mike] Yeah, Grandma and Grandpa will be fine on their own. - [Tom] Brought to you by the Greater Nursing Home Council. - [Crow] Never store your combustibles with your old people. (somber music) - [Mike] Later, a guy is somewhere in the dark doing something. - [Tom] This passes for a car chase in this movie. - [Crow] And step and dance and kickball change, and yes. ♪ Maria (pleasant music) - Lena? - [Tom] Or extra Lena? - [Mike] I'm not sure about this. - [Crow] You know, this doesn't look like it's headed towards a happy ending. - [Mike] You know, any ending would make me happier than I've ever been. - [Crow] That's true. - [Tom] She sees a squirrel and wants to go out. (ominous music) - [Mike] When track coaches go bad. - [Crow] And they expect the audience to feel bad about this, I guess. - Lena! - [Tom] Hi! - [Mike] Oh, remember to duck when you go under helicopters. - [Crow] Let me guess, he's gonna turn out his mouth and look depressed for a change. (ominous music) - Welcome home, Richard. - [Tom] I'm sorry, Ollie. - Did you like America? - [Mike] I liked "A Horse With No Name," but after that... (dramatic music) - [Crow] She's gonna make a perfect mid-afternoon talk show host, at least. (Mike and Tom chuckling) - [Tom In Creepy Voice] Hi. - [Announcer] Fellow delegates, our candidate is in the press room and will be joining us shortly. - [Mike] Wait, he's been killed. - [Announcer] Your nominee, the next president of the United States. - [All] Biography! Biography! - [Crow] Yay! - [Tom] Hey, it's... Oh, I thought it was Dale. Product placement. Now I'm gonna buy NBC. - [Walker] Ladies and gentlemen. - [Mike] Does anyone have a kidney to spare? - It is my pleasure this afternoon... - [Crow] Ted Turner. - To introduce to you the next president of the United States. - [Mike] Arrr, me buck-os. - A man we all know and love. - [Crow] Senator Gravy Skin. - The true people's choice. - [Tom] Gus Hall. - Presidential nominee, Senator Jeffery Knight. - [Mike] Arrrrr. - [Crow] And his lovely family. - [Tom] Thank you, thank you. I was killing my brother earlier today and, d'oh! - Thank you, thank you, George Walker. - [Mike] Arrrr. - Ladies and gentlemen of the press, let's get right to the questions. - [Tom] Who's coming up this week on "Biography?" - Miss Grady. - [Crow] Grady! - [Grady] Senator Knight, what will your position be on the subject of human rights? - [Jeff] Well, you know, I talked a great deal about that during the campaign but I think it's important to repeat it now. As president, my position will be that any suppression of rights or infringement-- - [Mike] Wow. - [Crow] Mm-hmm. - [Mike] Get it?! (Tom giggling) - As such cannot and will not be tolerated. - [Crow] Senator, I'm Brown from the Sun. - Senator! - [Jeff] Yes, gentleman in the back. - Bernie, Daily Sun. - [Tom] I love Bridget. - Senator could you please tell us about Clonus. - [Mike] Arrrr? - [Crow] Yes, definitely. Um, Brit Hume, front row. - [Tom] I can barely hear my heart beating. - [Mike] I'm a sad clown. - [Crow] Boy, that clock never moves, does it? (ominous music) - [Tom] Was that a bad movie or was I just in the wrong mood? - [Crow] Oh, we can leave, all right! - [Mike] Wait... Oh. Oh boy. Executive producer, Walter Fiveson, was a good friend of Supervising Executive Producer Ray Dryden. They grew up together in a log cabin with a woman involved in casting, Susan Arnold. - [Tom] But all was not as it seemed. - [Crow] The arrival of Associate Producer Peter R.J. Deyell, proved both groundbreaking and heart wrenching for the young Liverpoolians. - [Mike] And then Co-Producer Michael Lee and Carolyn Haber and Michael Lee and Paul Berkowitz and Joe Gianonne and Robert Cummings and Michael Lacoe and some other guys and Harley Pence. - [Tom] I'll take it, Mike. The oddly named, Timaree McCormick, young and brilliant production assistant, developed an unhealthy fixation of Joe Blasco, founder of the Joe Blasco Makeup School. - [Crow] I'll take it. Dwight LaVers, a name known to millions, yet a dark mystery, to even his closest friends. - [Mike] Tomorrow, the fascinating world of M.A "Ma" Schreibman who conquered his blindness to become one of the most sought after visual consultants in the business. - [Tom] The thin stylings of Brogan DePard... Brogan... Paul Sharp and Ted Keep, two crisply-named young men, tonight on "Biography." - [Crow] Freeze Frame, the J. Geils Band. Synonyms in the hearts of Americans everywhere. (Mike laughing) - [Mike] Ah! Peter Graves, the underrated, underpaid and incredibly handsome host of "Biography," tonight on "Biography." - [Crow] Tonight on "Biography," Paulette Breen who turned down perfectly innocent sexually advances from Peter Graves on the set of the movie "Clonus," who will never work in this town again. - [Tom] James Mantell, in a striking coincidence, shared a first name with the hulking, expressionless pseudo cowboy, James Arness. James Arness, as a young boy, James Arness nurtured a howling bitterness in the face of the awesomely superior talent of his brother, Peter Graves. Peter Graves' life and career were marked by a generosity of spirit and loving attitude towards his fell man, which were altogether missing in the pitted soul if James Arness. Often, James Arness' mother would remark to friends that she loved her son, Peter Graves, so very, very much, while she hates James Arness and cursed the day her womb had been blighted with such a creature. James Arness, ugly and stupid. Tonight on "Biography." - [Crow] Okay. - [Mike] That's as good as it gets. So, Peter Graves? - Biography. - [Mike] Biography. - Agua! (rumbling) (thudding) (beeping) (mechanical buzzing) (chains rattling) (buzzing) (clearing throat) So, what do you think of my new nose job? - It's downright Bruce Jennerian. - Yes, well I went a little deeper than I might have because I feel I can always add more later if I wanted. - Mike, Bobo's calling. - What're you looking at? - Please, Mike, keep it quiet. Evil orphan space children were very fussy getting down tonight. I think they're off their routine. - Aw, well I've got just the thing. I wrote a little night music inspired by a poem I've always loved. The words are, "Sleep, oh fair one, sleep. "The night is low and drowsy, "your dreams are fair and deep. "On feeble tender wings rest all Earthly things. "Sleep, oh gentle lamb, "till morning mother sun does bring." - That's beautiful. - Okay, Mike. (exciting marching band music) (crying) - You are so dead, Nelson! It is a John Agar film festival for you! (thudding) (groaning) (crying) (somber music) - Sure.
