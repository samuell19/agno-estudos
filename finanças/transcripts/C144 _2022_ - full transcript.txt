When you are in the jungle, you must follow the rules. FIRST! Never call names at night. Second, Never pick up anything in the jungle. Why? Sometimes better not to ask. Just listen! Third, Always ask permission whenever you want to do something. And last, Stick with the group. Never ever go alone. Fire! Don't show off ah, Kabal! Don't call names in the jungle, remember? Sorry, sorry. I didn't know your name was Kabal. Then I call you Kurma la. Ok le! -You guys know la, right? You're not supposed to call each other's name at night. - Ya... I think we should give each other a nickname so we can use at night. Yeah! Tha's right. Good idea! Guys, do you know that they discovered this aircraft after a very long time? It's been more than 50 years. Yes you are right. This is the very aircraft that crashed during World War 2. So indeed it does have a very high historical value. But this aircraft is not the only thing that you need to worry about. All of you must respect the jungle. If you don't respect, something will happen to you. Aye guys! Guys! Not only that, legend say never look up at the trees at night. H's right! Can I see? - Thank you. - Don't challenge supernatural. You don't know how dangerous it is. If you don't know what to do, just follow the rule and listen to me. I hope everyone is very clear now. If anyone doesn't follow the rule, anything happen, not my problem. What happened? You suddenly spoke Japanese. And you suddenly hummed a song. Girls, calm down... You can use mine. Where you going, Peter? What is that gu's problem? Can't he just shut his mouth for once? Idiot! Chanel? Chanel is that you? Chanel? Chanel? You there? Hello? Chanel? Hey! Quit playing around! I know yo're there. Chanel? It isn't funny anymore. Hey quit playing around, alright?! Come on!

Alright, everybody listen up. From this point forward, We gonna have to go down that slope. Are you kidding? Seriously? You want us to go all the way there? Hey! You never mention anything about this when we first discussed. Jie... don't worry Yes, y-you are right. But plan has changed. You told us it's all the way by car to the aircraft. So what's this? Seriously what type of planning do you have? Well I guess they are not familiar at all. Alright everyone, just calm down, ok? I'm the organizer of this trip. Obviously I know where we are going.

Hey, ther're others here, Don't cause them to panic, ok? Calm down Okay... - Okay? W're good ah? - Okay... W're good. Everything's fine guys. There's nothing to worry about. Bro I... I m so sorry I... I actually left my bag in there and... the GPS is in it! Kamal, Where's your bag? - I... Where's your GPS? I... You mean we've been walking around all this time with no GPS. What? You lost GPS Why? Aisyah? Wha's going on? If 'm not wrong, they had lost the GPS. In other words, we are lost in the jungle. Why are you not honest to us? YOU... should have told us! Bro... what are we going to do now? I got this, ok? Don't worry guys, just because we lost the GPS doesn't mean we are lost! I still got this compass. I got the bearing. I got the bearing... Hey guys! Can we cancel this trip? Shun is very scared now. Can you lead us back to where we were just now? Bro, I think we should just cancel Can you just shut up and follow?! I don't need you to question me anymore, ok?! Let's go! Didn't you all say you want to reach the aircraft earlier?! I will not be responsible for any of your delays! And i will not hesitate to charge the fifth day, alright?! Have i make myself clear?! Let's go! Jason! Are we going to reach the aircraft site on time? I'm afraid I will need to charge you for the fifth day onward! Seriously?! Can we just stop and rest?! Look at her! Please! Guys, guys, I found a place for camp! Come on, let's go! Can I ask? Why do you put those things on the ground? What is that? Actually it's for our protection. Protection? From what? From that kind of thing ? Does it help? I... think so. Actually I don't think I can get us to the plane without the GPS. What?! Then...? What do we do now? Bro! Answer me! See! I told you, right? We should have cancelled the trip in the first place. I... I spent the money. What did you say? I... spent all the money to clear my debt. WHAT?! I... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! Just calm down, bro. Listen. Even if we cancel the trip now, we can't give the money back Well, I guess something's wrong again. Well, you know. Jenn is coming. Can we just talk about this later? Please Anything happened? They can't even work together. Nothing. Just personal stuff. W're starting early tomorrow. You should get some rest. Haven't sleep ah, bro? Maybe we should go find the GPS. You think so? You were right. We should've canceled the trip earlier. Great! Then We can bring all of us home. But the money though Don't worry about the money! Just make sure that they are safe. We need to find it before the sun rises. Bro, is this the right way to my backpack? It does seem like we've been here before. You know what? Let's just head this way. Bro, wait Are you sure... this is the right way to your bag? I... I... 'm not sure. Kamal, you only have one damn job! - Seriously...?! What's wrong with you? What do you mean "What's Wrong..?" Look at where we are! We are lost! I don't even know what to say to you right now. Jason! WHAT?! Ya right! That way Go la! One after another! Jason! Nice Check out those mountains. Hey...Come back here..come on! give me back...come on! I've been watching you. I know what you're up to. What if I show this to the girls, what would the group think of you then? I didn't do anything wrong! Those photos are just candid! Go ahead! Show it to them! I don't care! Really? Really? Including the photos you took with the girls, hiding like a creep without them knowing? You know what? I actually only came for the aircraft. There's something very valuable . - What? Like treasure? You could say that. There's an artifact in that plane tha's worth a lot of money. Then why take my camera?! If I can't get the artifact, I could always get some money for these pictures. That was close! Good try! Guys!I heard Pete's voice! Yeah, Yea... I wonder where Peter is. I don't know, maybe wild animal ate him. We are in the jungle. Animal eat Peter?! Guys! Anyone seen Jason and Kamal? They are not here! Peter, Jason, Kamal The're gone! We need to follow Tam Tam back to the car! Only he knows the way back! NO! I came here for the aircraft! There's no way 'm going back in there! Ya! H's right! Ya! We follow him. We all must stick as a group! It is not good to separate! Tam Tam, what do you suggest? You mean yo're not gonna help us out? How could you? Guys! You all should be worrying about this! We only have one day of food left! And if we don't make it back... by tonight, there will be no more food for us tomorrow! Give me half the food and get lost! - Relax... Stop! Hey! Stop it! Are you ok? Alright! Just take half of the food and you can go! If any of you wanna join me, you can. If not, you can rot in the jungle. What shall we do now? I guess we need to find Jason and Kamal, since Tam Tam is not gonna help us. How do we know whether they are still alive? So Jaso's and Kamal's bag is not there. But Peter's bag is still here. It means that Jason and Kamal must have go out to look for the GPS. So we need to find them. And also I've recorded the video footage of where we came from. This could help us. How're you doing? I am tired and thirsty. Let's get some water there. We've never been here before. Are you sure this is the right place? We can never go wrong by following the stream. But we need to go all the way up there. I guess this is the safest route up there. And we have to keep going before nightfall. Let's go. Jenn are we on the right track? Sorry, guys. There's no more battery life left. And I'll been following the tracks from the video. Looks like this is the furthest we can go. So you mean... we are lost now? This is not good. Is there any other way we can get out from here? - Shun? Shun! is a kind of amulet! Whatever in the jungle, all of us are not supposed to pick it up! Shun I would advise you, putting down that thing. You don't know what curse it might bring upon us all. Yoga you seem to know all of these? Please! Respect the forest! Whether you believe it or not it's not meant to be offended! I can somehow sense that the jungle is alive. Who do you think you are?! I am not your slave and I do not serve princesses! Put up your own tent! Sebastian, the day is not dark, why we no go to the plane? You can always leave if you want. Since Jason and Kamal are not here. means I'm in charge. Got problem with that? Hey! No food for us! There's a loaf of bread here, you can have that If not, I can have it. Fine! I will protect you. Look! Be careful! I think we are lost. If we found a river... we can definitely find a way out. River..? I thought we just went past Jenn, There was a waterfall just now! Why don't we follow the trail in the first place? You say you can find a way and bring all of us out! Look at us now! I am trying to figure a way out! Just trust me and follow! We all trusted you! But what is this now?! OK! If you think you know so much then why don't you lead us out?! What are you talking about?! Try to push all responsibility to me? No... -I did not say that, Okay?! So it's not my responsibility to bring us out in the first place! [ complaints in the background ] ENOUGH! Can you two just calm down? We know that we're stuck in this jungle. But this is not the right time for us to fight or argue! W're supposed to be a team! Solving the problem together! Not pushing the responsibility to one another! We need to be more focused! No matter how much we quarrel, it's useless! The problem will still be unsolved! Yoga A team? All you know about is putting this toy everywhere! N~! but it is there. Please tell me that this is not true. That is supposed to protect us! But that does not makes any sense! Yes! I believe it's something to do with the amulet. Since Shun had touched it, I's been following us since then. And she is the only one who can see it. Aisyah! Yoga Yoga Please help me I feel something is around me. Aisyah Just... trust me. Okay? Whatever happens to me, just run. Find Jie and Shun. Yoga, what are you going to do? And when you run don't turn back. If you do, you might end up lost in the jungle forever. Aisyah! Run! Yoga!! Don't turn back! Just run! I'm so sorry, Yoga. I don't know what's going on. I should have listened to you. Kamal Hey! Kamal Hey! Kamal! Kamal! Hey! Kamal! What happened? Oh! Dude! Your leg! My leg! - Hey Kamal, I think I gonna have to settle in, dude! Ready? Three! two! Thank god you're still alive, man. Aye... Hold still ah This is a secret Chinese remedy I learned from my mother. I know it seems weird. Trust me it will work. Come on man! You feeling better man? What the...?! What? - Did you just rub sesame oil on my feet? I mean it's an old Chinese remedy, You don't know la. Well, Let's get going. Where's the compass? I... I'm so sorry, bro. If... I haven't told you about the crashed aircraft, we wouldn't be here right now. It isn't exactly your fault, ok? We don't even know where we are. Are we gonna die here, bro..? Hey.... Enough of that, ok? W're gonna get out of here with everybody. We go back to our city lives We live the rest of our life happily, ok? You're good to go? Yea... - Alright? Come on. Three! two! Why you so heavy, dude? You should have joined the other group. Guys! I found a shelter! Come... Is there anyone here?! I need help! I need help! Jie, over here! Come follow me! I found a room! Aisyah, is that you?! Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Peter? Where have you been? I'm sorry, I'm just so hungry. Sebastian where are you...? Sebastian! - Sebastian! You don't have to call him anymore. Why?! Because I killed him. What?! Why did you kill him? Because he tried to kill me first. Leave me alone! You girls should thank me, you know! Do you know how dangerous he is? You have no idea, Sebastian was trying to use you! You girls aren't going to tell the group that I killed Sebastian, are you? I knew it! How could I be so naive to think that you two could help me keep a secret but NO! Why you girls looking at this? Are you trying to steal it from me? So you are going to kill me. No Peter, please don't be like this! You're scaring us! AM I RIGHT?! Peter, You better put it down! ANSWER ME! Look at me! Do I look... like someone who would hurt you? Oh no BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME! Chanel I'm so sorry. I don't mean to hurt you. Chanel, are you ok? Geena! GEENA! GEENA! Shun! I'm so glad that you recovered. Luckily we met a scientist last night. Scientist? Who are you? What you're doing here? Please! You gotta help me! My friend is dying! Follow me! Over here! - We're almost there! You will be ok! It's okay, it's okay. - What is going on? Don't worry. - Can I trust you guys? They know what are they doing... - Okay, okay Jie. Just trust them Wha's going on? - It's okay. You seems familiar with the jungle and the native people here. Yes, this group of people that lives here are known as the "Orang Asli". I've written a couple of papers about them. Would you like to see them? Yes please. Thank you... - yaa.. How long have you been here? Well, actually I came here to study insects. But I also spent a long time studying these people's culture and their believes. I heard that the native people have their own mythical believes. What are your thoughts on that? That's a good question. And actually it's very true! Yes, they do! They believe in all sort of spirits. and the Gins . Gins are spirits and they have Gin Tanah which is the spirit of the earth. Gin Air the spirit of the water. They also have a belief that there are spirits within the forest. This would be called the "Orang Bunian". or the whispering people. I don't understand what happened to my friend, Shun yesterday. She told me she was seeing "things" in the forest. Do you believe that's true? Well your friend may have done something to upset the spirits of the forest. the "Orang Asli" believe you should seek permission, before you do anything in the forest. Don't joke about the jungle. We don't know what we might be offending. Before you enter the forest, you should seek permission first. you should always show respect in the forest You don't damage things. You don't break plants. You don't make noise. You don't act foolishly. You also don't call out each other names in the night. And never ever walk alone in the forest. A lot of people believe these things but there are many people who do not. I cannot say I believe... and.. I also cannot say that I do not. But it is much safer to just follow what they practice. So what are your thoughts? What do you think? Your leg feeling better? Yea... See, I told you Chinese remedy works right. What ever you use. Bro Wha's that? Is that our compass? It is our compass. What? Like how? Ya... how? Why is it pointing there? Ok. Let's go. Kamal! We found the plane! I can't believe we found it! Wait, I told you I was right, right? Aye, dude. You go and rest first, and I'll go and explore ok? Kamal! Wha's happening? Kamal, what's wrong with you?! Have you lost your mind?! Kamal! Get Yourself Together, Kamal! Kamal! Wake up! Kamal! Kamal Bro What happened? You would't believe what happened? So what now? I don't know, man. Hey! Who are you?! Do you know that you are trespassing?! You are not supposed to be here! We brought a group of people to look for the aircraft C-47B. What?! How many of you are there?! You better tell me everything! Squad! Squad! Attention! Stand At Ease! Stand At Ease! Squad! There is a group of people who are lost in the forest! We need to rescue them as soon as possible! Understand?! Yes Sir! I promise we will find them! Surrender yourself! I'm alone! Kamal! Jason! I's me. Peter! What happened to you?! He is the murderer! He killed my best friend! Peter! Do't do it! What are you doing? Calm down! Just put the knife down! Don't do anything stupid! Stand Down, Cool Down! Yaya, Peter, don't do anything rash! Your whole life is ahead of you! You don't need to do this! Look at us! Ok?! No one has to be hurt! Look at me! Jason! Peter! Peter! Wait! W're on your side! No no no no! Do't shoot! Don't shoot! H's with me! Is he seeing things as well? W're only trying to help you! Just stand down! Peter! Peter, it's over! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! It's over! Listen man! Listen! We all here! JASON! Kamal... I am so sorry Kamal... Are you alright? It was... all my fault! This incident happened 70 years ago. It was during this second world war where this particular American Plane It was transporting goods from Singapore to Butterworth in Malaysia. It crash landed in a small town in Perak in Malaysia which is called as Beruas. There was three people on the plane as for the Americans. one was the pilot, one was a Captain by rank in the army, and the other one was a Sapper in rank in the army. Obama has promised his people if he brings them out of their country for any incident or any issues, he will make sure they are brought back, dead or alive So this is where the NGOs came into Act and they requested to Obama that to fulfill his requirements and his promises that he has made to his country. That's where he communicated with our country. We felt great doing this honor for our Big Brother (USA)! And we managed to locate the plane. But it was not an easy task going into the virgin jungle to make your way through, we have to carry all the equipments But at the end of the day, we managed to reach the crashed site. We revived those things, and we sent it back to US to do a DNA test. and the DNA result came out as a confirm item that is whatever remains we got back, was confirm was theirs. We decided to give it a Royal Send Off, by wrapping the three coffins with an American flag from the Subang Airport in Kuala Lumpur. In the jungle there's a lot of taboos or do and don'ts which they believe, they refer to these people as "Small People", "Orang Halus" "Orang Halus" can be in a form of "Gins", it can be "Bunian" If you go to the site where they practice the "Anjak" you should not, in any circumstances remove anything near or on the site This ritual is an exorcism where they drive off the evil spirits from the "sick" person and leave it in a specific place The "Gins" are the things that give problems and to people who enter the jungle. So you bring one of these, stick it on the ground and then you walk away, go on with your journey. This toy-like... object is actually a riddle. It is a riddle meant for these unseen things in the jungle but you have the idea is to get these "bad spirits" occupied and doing something, so that they do not disturb us or people who go in to the jungle Okay, one of the other spirits which is very... famous in a way...It's the "Bunian". The "Bunian", they believe is actually living things that is in the other realm. You cannot see them but they can see us. They will entice you to do certain things, you think they are human, so you follow them, and then you sing along with them. and you play games with them, and then you disappear in their world. Yoga is not an expert in the belief system but he is a believer. And he knows what to avoid and what to do and not to do in the jungle. The reason why we suggest that he had joined the "Bunian" world He is the only one in the movie that was not found. The rest made it out of the jungle either dead or alive but Yoga disappeared in the jungle. Urban legend... Be it Bigfoot or the Bellwitch, Pontianaks (Female Vampires) or Toyols (Goblins) I believe all legends begins with reality. Either someone with a super power of imagination has written it or it really did happened and someone found a way to avoid the negative effects of the spiritual realm. There are uncountable unexplainable situations in the world, be it reality such as conspiracies or spiritually such as fairies, witches or wizards, ghosts or spirits of a place. There are even humans who can predict the future and look into the past. If one can explain it logically, well and good. If not, out of desperation one will try anything in hope for the best solution that is befitting. There are thousands of myths that cannot be explained neither by science nor logic and that is where the mystery lies and that is why is it so intriguing. The choice is still yours, either to accept the practices to avoid unwanted repercussions and hope to avoid tragedies, or be brave, kill the curiosity cat to end the myth. When the time comes, you choose.
