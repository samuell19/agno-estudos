–êfter the coup d'etat on february 21, 2014, mass demonstrations began in eastern ukraine against the policy of the new regime, which violated the rights and freedoms of residents of this region. In response to this, on april 13, 2014, the national security and defense council of Ukraine decided to conduct an "anti-terrorist operation" (ATO) on the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In fact, under the guise of the anti-terrorist operation, large-scale military operations were organized by the ukrainian state bodies, which entailed the mass extermination of the civilian population. The Ukrainian authorities sent regular troops and volunteer battalions (the so-called "dobrobats") to the south-east of the country, most of which were criminal elements, looters and nationalists. In fact, the widespread genocide of the russian-speaking population has begun. Punitive measures were used to intimidate civilians, including bombing residential areas from the air and ground. The so-called "wandering mortars" installed on civilian vehicles have gained particular popularity. As a result of the fighting on the territory of the donetsk and lugansk people's republics, according to official statistics alone, 6,255 people were killed, 127 of them children. According to the latest data from the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, for the entire period of the conflict, from april 14, 2014 to march 31, 2020, the number of victims reached 44 thousand people.

The katsaps (likening a stereotypically bearded Russian man to a goat) have already rummaged around. Resist bitches. And this is our greyhound. Hear, I stopped somehow at a gas station, shouted to the boys: "Glory to Ukraine!" And this one sent me the fuck. Bitch. Escaped three times. Well,now we cut his tendons on the heels. now there's no fucking running around. What are you shining your headlights on? Work. Gibbon. Let's go. Let's go straight to "you". Our situation is complicated, Lech. The weapons that lay in the warehouses are from the time of the Second World War. With uniforms the same ass. Sponsors only help, that's all. There are very few experienced fighters. The chaps were braveon the Maidan, but here everything is serious. So you need to teach them, train them. Will you? Let's try. And these are my boys in the neighboring village took a walk. Separ was caught there. Walked with a colorado ribbon, moron. (a mocking insult of the ribbon, similar in color to the —Åolorado beetle) Not too much with a ribbon? Wow! Didn't expect from you, Lech. Honestly. Or maybe I should give him a drink, feed him and put him to bed, like in that fairy tale, huh? So this is not a fairy tale. There's a war here. It's no different with these bastards. You must understand this, Alex. Did they lie down under the Muscovites? Yes, legs apart, right? And I, Leshenka, do not want to be treated as they like. Let's go. You'll see enough of this shit later. - What are you looking at, monkey? - You'll be fine now. Why are you lying down? you'll freeze. Are you okay? What do you like, huh? I'm... Here's how I think. They will play the fool there in Kiev and calm down. It's not a big deal., they want to go to Europe. To Europe, wow! We have already lived in that Europe. Lived for almost 7 months. You know, Lugansk was then called Voroshilovgrad. I was still a kid, but I remember everything, everything. Everything. Then the Germans were here, and the Italians, and these Romanians - all this Europe. - So they bomb the city first. - Juice... And then in their newspapers they write, that only the power of the great Germans can bring progress to Ukrainians. Then Germany was already called the great German. Serezha, that's enough. - What? Ninochka, try lecho according to my recipe. Ninotchka, do you have any? Is it poured there? Thanks. - So, I have a toast. - For all the good. - Hooray! - Hooray! Hello honest company, I brought the products. - Son! - Hello, Mom. - Bon Appetit. - I'm going to change my clothes - No no no! Join us. - Sit down with your father. I need to talk to you, sit down. Pash, you said that they want to cancel the Russian language, right? - Put it down. - Thanks. And I'll tell you so. This is complete nonsense. Even under the Germans, everyone spoke Russian, Russian. Not, except for those who wanted to go to Europe. Here they are, yes, they quickly forgot Russian and spread to mova (ukrainska mova). You see, dad, everything repeats. Pasha, you are talking nonsense. What is repeating? Then, Pasha, there was a war, the Germans, all kinds of shit. And now, Pasha, peacetime, understand? Or what? Kiev will bomb us, do you think? Everything can be. What could be? It was you who stirred up trouble in the city. You only scare people. Let's get to know each other. Let's. Here you are, well done. - Well? - For acquaintance!

They are there, bitch, firmly seated. It is necessary with them somehow more convincingly, or something. Let's try. Listen, I've been told some officers are gathering a group, sort of how to help us. Would you like to know who they are, did not hear anything? - Not. - Okay, I'm in the administration report back.

Am I understanding you correctly? They still have n‚Äôt really learned how to hold a machine gun. Yes, Lech! - This question is for you. Well, did you teach them? Do you think that in two days you can train a fighter? Okay, don't piss. Find out the situation and that's it. I'll give you a mortar. so that you don't piss yourself there. Commander, I'm sorry!

And I stay. - Listen, Ilyukha... - I don't want to listen to you anymore. - Why? - That's why. I think we should defend our country, not run away. You're still young, you don't understand a damn thing. Of course, where can I... First you need to protect what is dear to you. First of all, it is a family. For me, family is you, mom. Understand?

You're out there, adult. You make decisions yourself. Yes? Come on, stop. Have you seen enough films about the war? Do you know what it is? This is not romance, these are not feats, Ilyukha! War is scary! And it's not scary that you get hurt or killed. Wounded - it will hurt, but not scary. Kill - you will not understand anything! And it's scary when others are killed in front of you! And you can't do anything to help - that's scary. It's impossible to get used to it! It's clear?! I'm going on shift.. I hear a voice from a beautiful distance. Morning voice in silver dew. Turn on! Edik, come on. I hear a voice, and an alluring road. It spins its head like a carousel in childhood. Children, dear, beloved, there is no sparkle in the eyes.

Your students... are dead. Vlad, sit down, please. What is this? Stupidity, how did they die like that? dead? BUT... And how is it ... how ... . I can‚Äôt understand one thing, why are they shelling the villages? In the same place, except for ordinary residents, there is no one. Their tactics are like this. Nightmare the civilian population in order to turn against us. As during the Great Patriotic War - burn down the village, so that it would not be habitual to help the partisans . Yes, all sorts of rubbish got out. To whom is war, and to whom is dear mother. And what about the border? We are working. I promised, we'll solve the issue on the border - you'll leave right away. Hello. Where are you from, friend? I saw her in Kyiv. - Just before you come here. - Come on. Did she run here from Kiev to you ? No, I just have such a sign from Afghanistan. If you see a white dog before the fight, then everything will be all right. Just be sure to be white. Well. - Excuse me, are you Pavel Sergeevich? So, is something really wrong? I would like to know, I want to join the militia. Me too. Your aspiration, of course, causes respect. But, excuse me, how old are you, 70 years old? And vision somewhere minus 5, minus 7? Does not matter. - Are you 17 years old? - Eighteen. Look, I really respect your willingness to help. But you both have every chance in the first fight, as they say, die the death of the brave. I don't need more sacrifices here. So go home to your family. - I have no more relatives! - Listen! Do you really think that you have the right to decide who can protect their land, and who can not?

Who tortured you? Go away! Shh, hush... It's all right, calm down. Well, what is it, brother? It's me... This is all because of me. He was gone for two weeks. I thought that's all. And today he returned. He needs to be taken to the hospital in Lugansk. They kept him in a cage. They asked about the separatists. I say, what kind of separatists are here? This is where we live. I told you - take off that ribbon. And he says: "Grandfathers fought with her, and I will go with her." I could not. I told them that I know nothing. And they didn't believe. - I only told them to let them go. - Let's go. I won't let him go anywhere. He will stay here. I take it out myself. So I will be calmer.

Reset. - Kidding. To their hospital. Then we'll figure it out. Understood! Look look. Wow, did you decide to help us? That's right, why sit with your mother? It happened to me the first time too. - Nothing, Ilyukh, you'll get used to it. - I hope no. Commander! Found another one! Wounds treated? Take him. Vlad, let's go. Let's go! Burov Igor Sergeevich. Moscow?! Tekstilshchikov, 31. Deniska, by the way, have you been to Moscow? Nope. And I was. Yes. Went on vacation with my wife. We walked along Red Square. We went to TSUM. TsUM ‚Äî Central Universal Department Store - In GUM. - At VDNH too. The wife liked it very much. This, he says, is life! Real! And there is no prospect. Yes... Well, what are you waiting for, sit down. In short, she left. See how it turns out. Everyone who is smarter is leaving here for Moscow. And you are the opposite. What didn't work out for you there? I just want to understand you. So you came to Kyiv. Well, you jump there along with everyone. Tires burned. Well, I somehow understand you until now . But why the hell did you take the machine in your hands? Do you like killing people? And I'll tell you. You are a shit-man. Do you think he took a machine gun - did he look like a man ? No. You're just shit with a gun now. Polina Maksimovna Stepanchuk. 29 years old, your wife. Artem Grigorievich is your son. Registered in the village of Gorskoe, Mykolaiv region. Lviv region. Kyiv wanted to see? And what, on the Maidan is more fun than with your own family? You shouldn't have left them there. I sent my people there. What are you looking at? You don't have a family anymore. Your wife was raped and stabbed to death. Artyom was also killed. Throat was cut. Do not trust? Do you want me to show you a photo? What are you, bastard ... bad joke ... Sit down! They called your wife, they found out about you. They are waiting for you... Everything is fine with your family. But with ours, no. We didn't come to you, but you came to us. What for? I couldn't even imagine. You were completely different back then. I don't want to remember it. Ah... Do you have a family? There is. Wife and son. And the wife, probably, cooks deliciously? And the son ... loves his dad very much? And everything is fine. And then suddenly the war started at the wrong time, right? War, it is always at the wrong time. After all, you stormed cities, took heights. Was one of the best. Just when was that? And now it's better to sit on the sidelines. So it will be calmer. - And who are you fighting with, Lech? - What? Who are you fighting? Ah... yes, yes... You still tell me that there are no Russian troops here. And they really don't. but you are here. When we crossed paths in Kiev in 1999, I already then realized that you definitely need to fight with someone. So many years have passed since we left Afghanistan. And you stayed there. Remember, under Gardez? Sasha... Oleg... Pasha... They still haunt me. This is war, Vlad. - It happens in war. - I don't want it to be like this anymore! Understand? I wish my family would never know that this happens! - Not everyone is so lucky with a family! - And I was lucky! lucky Leh. Dad... Let's go home. Go. Let's walk! Don't push. Well, citizens are volunteers. As they say, according to the laws of war? Zheka, brotherly heart, only I beg you, take them somewhere else. Let them fall on all four sides. And I won't see you again! Cat, put them in the car. Come on, let's go. Go, go! You are good, Pavel Sergeevich. What to do with these idiots? Shoot them, right? This is wrong, Jake. All wrong. Well how are you? Katyusha, why do you have a black sun? Do not know. Let's color it yellow. Hello mom. - You know what... - Sorry, I feel bad. I'll talk to you later! And do you feel okay? Everything is fine? He is no longer a little boy, he is a grown man. Mm! And that's why you decided to show him how people die? So, can you give him a machine gun? Will you learn to shoot? You can. He should know too, right? - All right, that's enough! - What's enough? This is our son, understood, ours! Not yours! Aunt Nina, please don't swear. Kate, close the door. Katyushenka, let's go, this is adult talk. Let's go draw. I'm tired! I'm very tired... Nin ... Calm down, Nin. Calm down! Come out! Final. Well guys? You don't have to come to us. tell yours. No need. Bitches, fucked up creatures! You don't have to climb to them, huh! Yes, who are you anyway? Miner's bastard. Why were you silent? Why didn't you tell them all at once? - I'll tell you more! I'll see them. Where are you going? Home! Mom, yes, hello. It's me, me They gave me the phone for a while. Everything is good yes. Everything is fine. I'll be home soon. Just calm down. It's all right, it's all right, Mom. Yes Yes. Everyone, don't cry, don't cry. I'll be home soon. Cube of tramadol. - There is? - Yes. Stas, Ambu! Adrenaline prepare! - Faster, faster! Let's, let's. She said get going. Well, are you tired? Now let's stop at the store, buy some water. Will you stop? He said we would stop. lift it up Mom, where is my hand? Help? Come on, come on, come on! Boys, help the wounded man to be transported to the operating room. Help! Come on, what are you standing, help. One two Three! - Go! - Hurry, hurry. Let's have a smoke. By the way, I also have a son. Danka, Turned 15 in March. In fact, he doesn't want to talk to me . His mother was divorced a long time ago, it did not work out. Yes, and then... somehow it all didn't work out. You are right. It did not work out for me in a peaceful life. Are there many injured? The family was driving a car, four people, all died. Passers-by shrapnel hacked, eight people, four heavy. What are they doing, bitches, we are one country. Yes. Now I will. If anything, I'm at headquarters. Pash! A friend wants to help me. You know how to choose your comrades. We served in Afghanistan with him. If he wants to, let him help. Bonya, you are the best, you understand? I will never leave you. Zhulka! Zhulka! Where are you, Kat? - Zhulka is there, I am now! Where are you going? - Yes, you never know. - The weapon, it should be in order. Zhulka! But I don't care Uncle Pasha, well, that is, Pavel Sergeevich, he will take him into the militia anyway. I'm actually going to be 18 soon. Oh, yes, you invent everything. Militia... And what, I'm a man, I have to protect everyone. And you, by the way, too. Zhulka! Zhulka, stop! shot! Help! It was they from the mortar at us, I understood by the sound. Bastards! Phone of the called subscriber is turned off or is outside... Baby! Scared? Fell asleep. You know, all my life I wanted to forget the war. Get it out of your head like nothing happened. Did not work out. I will go. Thank you. Stay. Where will you go? I'll put a bed for you in another room. Give me an automat. Decided under our banners? You caught yourself too late, brotherly heart. I have 500 fighters. And the Ukrainian army is against us. This, you understand, is not a dobrobats. (volunteers) These are tanks, aviation, artillery. You can go against a tank with a machine gun, like with a saber with a bare ass. - And these former officers are some... - You said that a group is being assembled. This is nonsense, rumors, there are no former officers, and no one will help us. Pavel Sergeevich, here the information came. Yes, speak already, Zhek, everyone is here. Kyiv is sending reinforcements. Three aircraft. Landing and heavy equipment. That's what I'm talking about. So, you see, we will have to roll up our banners. Maybe we can arrange a meeting? Do you propose to take the airport by bull? They have 200 fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine sitting there. We've been butting heads with them for a month, but we can't knock out. Well, can we try something different? Dnepropetrovsk May 2014 Well, my friend, I'm glad that you heeded my advice, although I didn't invent anything new. This strategy was still used by German specialists in 1942 here. And we have already used it in different countries. It is simple and effective. Why waste strength, energy on direct collisions with armed rebels, as you originally suggested? It's a risk, it's a high percentage of losses personnel and weapons, this is irrational. Much easier, as they say in our business, transfer everything to outsourcing as much as possible. With someone else's hands! Yes. Absolutely. Look, you have terrified the local population. They are afraid. They are not ready to resist. That is, you solved this problem with almost no loss. Well, with those who are not ready to lay down their arms, our specialists will work. I am sure these guys will solve our problems in the shortest possible time. We will now strike at the very heart of our enemy. Where they don't expect. And do not worry, I will help you solve this problem. But in history, you will be the winner. ON THE RADIO: - "Dnepr" group "101st" - take off!

My great-grandfather was already here, in the 42nd. Here he is in the photo. He made them listen to Greater Germany. But he did not have time to do what he wanted. So now I'll finish it. - I do not understand. We have a lot of Ukrainians in Canada, but I have never been here. Now you can get to know them better. Do you understand what I mean? Too bad there are no snacks. Is a dead Russian for a snack good for you? You will have plenty of this snack tomorrow Then I'm afraid we took too little whisky. More whiskey!

Your feats are all over the news Well, that's how we work. Do you know that a dozen countries have declared mourning on this occasion? Why is that? -Yes, from that. That side the mercenaries flew: Poles, Balts, British, Kind of like Americans and Canadians. So we met these bitches beautifully. With fireworks. - Denis! Help. - Uh-huh, now. Let's lift it up! Right here. Vyacheslav Andreevich, I wanted to ask, what kind of book do you have? Denis, this is not quite a book for me. This... I'll let you see it later... - MLRS worked perfectly. - Everything is clear, you can advance. Let's go! With God. Your combat mission: Unite with our grouping, which defends the Lugansk airport. The separatists down our plane, which we counted on very much. For this we must triple hell for them, but in case of an emergency, you must evacuate from there our trump ace - a general from a friendly country. Accepted. We are working! Trumpet solo! "7th" everyone, get ready. We are working! We are working! - Cover! - I'm holding! Let's go! I'm holding! Sorry for the guys. They died helplessly. How did he shoot with such vision? Teacher, right? Calmly. Who are you? - Calm down, friends. We'll help you a little. If you don't mind, of course. Well, if you help, we won't refuse. We stopped the convoy two kilometers away , it was heading towards Lugansk. In general, you now have armored vehicles. Take away. Follow me! Listen, brotherly heart, maybe you can help too? We have everything. Richard Wagner Selected works I took the book and read it at my leisure.
