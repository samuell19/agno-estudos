- Can we go around them or do we have to go back? Plan has changed. They've got a prisoner. - I assume that means you're going in? Yep. Let's get to work. - We, we can't go in there! We'll be massacred! - You don't know Henry. - He's a legend. It's got to be smooth. - Hey! - Ha! Got him! Sim, have the crew meet me at the other side of the bridge. - I'm going in. - Come on. Wait here. - Oh, no! Come on! - Hey! Here they come! - Let's get ready to move. - Uh-oh. looks like they've got company. - Good for you, Henry! All right crew, let's get going. Looks like Henry's not finished yet. - What? What's he doing? Where's he going? - He's going back for his hat. - Yeah! - Sir! Are you okay, sir? Did I hit you, sir? Well I sure didn't hit myself! - What's going on out here? - You've got to get a handle on your day-dreaming, Henry. - I know, sir. There probably isn't much chance of me being a guide, huh, sir. Report of a prisoner coming in, sir. There's plenty of work to be done around here, Henry. - I can't believe you hit the boss! He needs help. - Henry's gonna be the death of me. - I don't think he meant to hit you, sir. - It still hurts just the same. - Well, back on business. I'm pretty worried we're not going to be able to keep up. There are so many prisoners escaping. We don't have the man-power to help them all. - It's these new laws. They're packing out the prisons. More prisoners means more runners escaping, which means more guides needed from us. So what do we know about this new guy? - He's a she, sir. She appears to be very spirited. From what the look-outs say, the wardens had quite a time getting her from the courthouse to the prison. - What prison was she headed to? Ravenshead. No! Let me go! Let me go! - Hey. Don't! Wait! Come back! Here, you'd better put these on. - Hey! I need you to calm down and follow me. Listen! It's for your own good. Come on. It's probably been a rough day, but you can't throw rocks at the guards. They don't like that stuff around here. Look. I'm on your side, but this isn't just about you. You can get us all in trouble. Stay away from the walls! Here, get under this bag! We'll be fine. This happens most every day. - Thanks. Sorry for losing it out there. It's just been a really rough day. I'm Sam. - Clyde. Hang in there. It'll get better. - Hey. Thanks again. - You're welcome. Remember, no throwing rocks at the guards. Hey, are you coming? - Runner from Ravenscar. - We can send Charles. That'd be fine. - He's our last guide, you know. I don't expect any of the others will be back for at least three or four hours. Any prisoner that escapes in that time will be on their own. - We've somehow made it through these tight spots in the past. Let's hope our luck holds out again. - These tight spots are becoming more and more frequent, sir. It's just a matter of time before we can't send help. - Next! Get out of there, Rat! One biscuit only! You got that? Next! You gonna throw rocks? - She's past that now, so give her a break. Okay, Clyde. - So what does he do? I mean, is he like a head prisoner or something? Kind of. He helps new prisoners settle in, keeps us in line. But mostly he keeps us going. Yea, without him down here it'd be pretty bleak. - Seems like he keeps a pretty positive attitude. Probably because he can escape whenever he wants. - He can escape! Shhh! - He can escape? Most of us can. But it's not about getting out; It's about staying out. Clyde's the only one that can stay out for very long. Oh, no. Don't get your hopes up, kid. Earthquake! - Phew. Hey, kid. You can come out now. Hey, kid? - Runner from Ravenshead. - Any of the guides back yet? We'll have to send headquarter personnel. - Hi, Henry. Hi, sir. Come in! Hi, Ike. - Hi. - Got a question for you, Walter. - Just a minute. Best cover your eyeballs. Aw, man! - Oh, no. - I guess that means we can't send you into the field. - That's your call, sir. There's always Henry, sir. - Oh, no! I'm sorry, sir! - So much for that idea. - Henry? Yeah? - Can you come here a minute? - Sure. Yes! - Shut the door, Henry. - It was the mop bucket, sir. - Fill him in. - Henry, we need your help in the field until we can get a guide back in. There isn't much time, so I'll be brief. Your main goal is to get the runner safely to the City of Refuge. There are two simple rules. First, you can't force the runner to the core against their will. Second, you can't hinder the wardens, they're just doing their job. I assume you know the standard flare codes? Henry? - Oh, um, yeah. - We've lost a lot of time on this one. If the runner hasn't been caught you should be able to rendezvous near the Red Bridge. Any questions? No, sir. - All right. Let's get to work. Good luck, Henry. - Thank you, sir. I hope we did the right thing. Me, too. - Finally a bit of a break. How does he do that? - Hi. You guys from the prisons? - Ravenscar. You? - Ravenshead. Hey, you know I saw a few wardens out in the distance. - Those are probably ours. - What do you mean ours? - You've got a warden, I've got a warden, they've got wardens. Those ones are probably ours. - Either way they're headed this direction. - Those two are done, so might as well get it over with. - What do you mean done? - Done. Finished. Worn out. When you get to the point you can't keep going anymore, you're done. Judging by the looks of you, you're not far from done either. - I don't plan to be done! I've been able to outrun my warden just fine! - You must be new to all this. Well let me give you a few tips. The wardens don't catch with speed, they catch with a steady relentless pursuit, never stopping, never resting. They let you burn yourself out. No matter how fast you run, they are always right behind you. And don't let the fact that they appear uninterested deceive you. Believe me, they only have one focus. - Well, you can't just sit around and give up. - You think we want to give up? You think we like this life? Slaves in those pits or tirelessly hunted out here with no rest and no hope? You think we have a choice? Reality is simple. Stop and they catch you. Run and they catch you. All we can do is delay the inevitable. - Has anyone gotten away? - There's a few that occasionally don't come back. Clyde thinks they, probably don't make it. - You know Clyde? - Sure. We all do. He's the only one that gives us a glimmer of hope. Sounds like they're moving the crew. Let me show you something. - Hey, uh, any of you been from Ravenshead? Ravenscar. - Thanks. Hey, uh, you know there's a city that, uh- We've heard about that whole thing. Thanks, but no thanks. - Okay. The bridge is out ahead. This area turned into a kind of bottle neck for the prisoners. - What's happening? - That's the main road back to all the prisons. The warden's bring their day's catch back here before herding them in. Odds are you and I'll be down there by tomorrow. - Thanks. - Shhh. You let him go! - It's no use. I'm done today. Your warden's coming! - I think this might be our problem. - What do you see, Walter? - This might be our problem. It might be this wire. I think it's 49. - Hey, 47! - No, 49! - No, it's 47! - No, 49! No, it's 47! Hey! Give that back! Ow! Quick! Grab the rope! - Who are you? - The name is Henry. I specialize in assisting the legally compromised and I'm here to render my services on your behalf. I'm here to help you. Whoa! Sorry. That was no help! Now what am I supposed to do? - Quick! - Clyde! - There's not much time! Grab the rope! Sam, you've got a lot of grit. - They told me it was tough out here. The wardens aren't fast, but they never give up. - I know a place. A city where they can't get you. Not again! Ow! Maybe someday we'll look back on this and laugh. Or maybe not. - He's a gem. - I don't know if I can keep going. - The one thing I've learned is that you've got to believe in yourself and never give up. Come on. - What city was he talking about? - I've seen it myself. It kind of looks like a trap because there is only one way in and out. Here's where we part. - Why can't I go with you? - It's not good for your warden and my warden to team up. Good luck, my friend. All right, let's give this thing a try. - Do you need some help? - Nope. - Bang! - Well, back to work. You guys have a broom? The one thing I've learned is that you got to believe in yourself and never give up. Reality is simple. Stop and they catch you. Run and they catch you. All we can do is delay the inevitable. No matter how fast you run they're always right behind you. They're always right behind you. Right behind you. - Come on, Sam! Get a hold of yourself! I know you guys aren't real! - East? That can't be East. West? Mock me, will you! I bet they're gonna want that back! Ew. I wonder where the rest of the pieces are. That's not the way it's going to be. I said, No. - Hey. You know, this isn't a great hiding spot. - I don't care. I'm done. - You think you can make it to that tree? - Why? - Please just trust me on this one. - What have I got to lose? That one there? - Run! Run! - I'm running, I'm running! What do I do? - Just run around the tree! - Hi. That was awkward. - No time to lose. You've got to keep moving. All right. We're here and we need to get you to there. I don't know if I can make it that far. Aren't these two cities a lot closer? - But there's only one City of Refuge. Uh-Oh. Looks like trouble. Quick! Out that tunnel. You'll find a trap door. Head towards the woods. You go about a mile before you'll find a tree with this symbol on it. Take a left up the hill and that will take you to the City of Refuge. Go! - Aren't you going with me? - I'm going to go out that tunnel to try to slow them down. - Which way do I go? - This is getting really awkward. I know it doesn't seem like it, but I'm really trying to stay out of your way. You know, I can't thank you enough for padding my fall earlier this morning. Get out of the way! Not the blackberries! Ow! - Just because we used him to fill a temporary emergency doesn't mean we should make Henry a permanent guide. - He's trying to do better, sir. You know he has good intentions. - He's got to put a little more thinking with his good intentions or someone's going to get hurt. - It's either that or let the runners fend for themselves. - They might be better off. The more I think about it, the more I think I was wrong in sending him out this time. I mean, he nearly did me in with the broom twice today. Then I give him a flare gun? And send him off unsupervised? It was a gross lapse of judgment on my part. - I don't think it's that bad, sir. I'm sure he's doing just fine. You head toward the woods, go about a mile before you'll find a tree with this symbol on it. You take a left up the hill and that will take you to the City of Refuge. Go! I don't know if I can make it that far. Aren't these two cities a lot closer? - I think I'm just gonna start crawling everywhere I go. Why doesn't she ever listen to me? - Be back in a second. Howdy. - Hi. Ike, are you in here! Ike? Are you in here? Ike! Are you okay? - Hey! Up here! Come here! - Gotta keep going. - Wait! Are you all right? - Yea, I'm fine. - It sure hasn't been your day. - I don't know. It's been better than most. - Well, looks like you're fine. Better be on my way. - You're going to the wrong city! Don't you remember what I told you? - I appreciate your help, but this city is closer and will work just fine. - Just listen to me for a minute! Why would a little guy like me be out here killing himself if there was no truth in what I'm saying? We both know I'm not out here just for my health. Okay, I'll listen, but make it quick. When the three prisons were built, a City was established. - Clyde! I'm headed down there! - Wait! Shh, look! - Don't give me that look. You probably wanted her handed over at the bridge. That's the problem with you wardens, you never understand the thrill of a hunt. - Clyde's one of them! - It's no fun unless you give them a sporting chance. - He's not a warden, but he's in with them. - Enough said. Let's get back to business. There they are! - Come on! - It's no use. The wardens are going to catch me sooner or later. - Won't you just try the City of Refuge? I'll do my best to help you get there. - Are you sure the wardens can't catch me there? - That's the only place they can't go. They're calling in the dog, we'll need some help. I assume you know the standard flare codes? - Hi, Walter. We have an odd flare code from down the North line. We think it's Henry. He needs some help. Is the rocket-car ready to go? - I'm not sure, sir. There's still a few problems. - It doesn't matter. We'll have to send her anyway. - Okay, sir. - You get Ike loaded and ready. Walter and I will head up topside and open her up. - Bring her up! Good luck, Ike. Bring her back in one piece! When you get to the City, all you have to do is cross the Bridge. Are you sure? Yep, I'm sure. - Okay, but if the wardens cross the Bridge, I'm done. - Here he comes! Duck! Hi, Ike! Howdy. Hop on! - You sure that thing is safe? - Oh, yeah. Ready, Ike? What's the matter? Get it going! Why won't it go? Come on, come on! Yahoo! - Don't look down! Get out of the way! - You snake! How could you do that? - Just doing my job, putting people like you back where they belong and you know what? I like it! - What about that believe in yourself and never give up stuff? - Whatever it takes to keep you going. - You're a liar! - You're a criminal! Help! - Help, please. - Are you all right? - I think my leg is broken. - Let me take a look at it. - No! Don't touch it! You can help me find my stuff. It spread all over when I ran into the tree. - Does that happen very often? - What? - Running into stationary objects? Sorry. That actually happens to me quite a bit. You really shouldn't be helping the wardens. - You shouldn't be helping the prisoners. - At least everyone knows what side I'm on. - Stuff? You gonna help me with my stuff? - Hey, look at this. There's two of them. Hey, I thought it was the other leg. No, you were right the first time. It was that leg. All right, all right, it's not broken. - Then why-- Because I was trying to do this! - Yay! - You listen up! I've got a good thing going here and you're not going to ruin it. Thinking you're a hero! When all you are doing is helping prisoners. The authorities were right when they convicted those people. They were also right in building a city. - Now that's where I disagree. Those people don't deserve mercy. None of us deserves mercy, but we all need it. Don't worry, there will always be enough of those who want to find their own way to keep you busy forever. But as long as they seek the refuge of the City, the Guide Service will always be there to help. - Not if I can help it! - What's that noise? Is everything okay? - We've got problems. You gotta jump. - Are you crazy? I'm not gonna jump! You have to jump! - No, I'm not jumping! - Looks like I got a souvenir. Let's talk this thing out... - I thought you weren't into that whole mercy thing. - Hold on a sec. You know the rules. You can't hit a warden. - You're right. As far as I can tell, you're not a warden! - You gotta jump! No! - You have to! - No, I'm not gonna jump. - Now! No! - You have to! - I'm not! Ow! Lookouts report an explosion and fireball near the City, sir. - It's got to be Henry. What has he done now? - We can't be sure it him. We'll just have to wait and see. - It's Henry. I hope there's something left to salvage once he's done. - Go! - Hey, Ike! She made it! Where's your rocket car? It's broken. - Walter's not going to be happy. Isn't it ironic that she should find freedom in the confines of a City? - No. - You were right! Thanks for sticking with me even when I wouldn't listen! You're welcome! - Glad to be of assistance! - Good-bye my friends! I'll never forget what you did for me! - Bye! - Makes it all worth it, doesn't it? Well, time to go, my friend. - Hey, you're back! That's it? That's all that's left? Well, I think we can make a better one. Wish I could be a fly on the wall in that room. - I hope I won't regret this, but I'll give you a chance at full time guide duty. But remember, it's probationary. If you can't reduce the collateral damage, it's back to the mop. Thank you, sir! Henry!
