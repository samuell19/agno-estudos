[music playing] Oh, Frankie, where have you been? I got caught in a traffic jam. [whistle] Boy, look at that new receptionist. She's a honey. You'd better forget about her and put your uniform on. You know how Mr. Carl is about us being late. Yeah. Plenty of time, my boy, plenty of time. Now, if you'll excuse me? Good morning. -Good morning. May I help you? Yes, would you see if there's any mail for me, please? Perhaps, you'd better tell me your name first. Yes, of course, Ryan. Frankie Ryan. What's yours? Anne Mason. No, there's nothing for you, Mr. Ryan. All right, thank you. Say, you're new here, aren't you? Uh-huh. Just started this morning. From out of town? Uh-huh. Well, which is it? Singer or an actress? Oh, singer. I've always wanted to be in radio, and this is as close as I could get. But how do you know all this? Oh, well, you see, all our employees would like to be on the air, but, well a lot of them are pretty good too. But well, you see, most of them just don't get an opportunity. Singer, huh? Say, has anybody auditioned you yet? No, not yet. Well, we'll have to take care of that right away. Right away? You mean right now? Why, sure. There's no time like the present, you know. Well, what about my job here? Oh, well, that can wait. This is important. You see, the radio field is always open to new talent, and well, yours might be just the voice we're looking for. You're very kind, Mr. Ryan, but I don't think I-- Oh, no, no. I won't take no for an answer. Come on. Uh, Stella, you watch the desk, will ya? We're going to audition Miss Mason. You're what? You heard me, audition Miss Mason. Right this way, Miss Mason. Well, of all the-- Mr. Frankie, I can't. I gotta the jitters plum down to my toes. Suppose that-- -Well, what's the matter, Jeff? You're doing fine. Now, come on, try it again. Are you sure this is all right, Mr. Ryan? Of course, it's all right, Miss Mason. Jeff is just worried because we're using this office instead of the regular audition room. It makes no difference where we is. If that Mr-- Jeff. Are you ready, Miss Mason? Yes. Nervous? A little. Oh, well, that's only natural. We're all that way at first. All right, Jeff, go ahead. well, good luck. Go on, Jeff. [MUSIC - MARJORIE REYNOLDS, "BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS"] Wow, ain't that something. Mr. Frankie. Say, you have got a voice. That was great. Oh, thank you. I'm glad you liked it. Like it? Why, say with a voice like that, you've got no business behind a reception desk. I can see you now, a star. Your name-- We're all gonna be seeing stars if we don't get out of here. That Mr. Farrell-- I thought I'd find you here. Up to your old tricks again, huh? This ain't my idea. I know who's idea it is. Oh, Mr. Farrell, this is Miss Mason. She's got a wonderful voice. The greatest you've ever heard. Well, how do you do, Mr. Farrell? How do you do? And don't try to evade the issue. Why aren't you in uniform, and why aren't you at work? You took the words right out of my mouth. Well, we didn't mean any harm, Mr. Farrell. That's not the point. One more shenanigan like this, and you're gonna find yourself out of a job. -Yes, sir. -Now, get busy. See if you can find Miss Wilson. She's holding up the rehearsal. Yes, sir. Right away. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Farrell. I didn't know. It wasn't your fault. I know that. Well, then I won't lose my job? Of course not. Well, thank you, Mr. Farrell. Not at all. Mr. Farrell will call you when he wishes to see you. Anne, have Rita Wilson report to Mr. Hastings as soon as she comes in. All right. FRANKIE: Miss Wilson, please. Oh, page. Page, front please. Oh, page, when Miss Wilson comes in, have her see Mr. Hastings at once. It's important. Look, Anne, will you forget about-- That will be all, page. Nice work, honey. You sure put him in his place. Well, he needed a lesson. But he is kinda cute. Excuse me, Miss Wilson. What is it? Mr. Hastings would like to see you in his office right away. That's all for today. Some other time. And Mr. Farrell is waiting for you in Studio A. Tell Mr. Farrell I'll see him as soon as I talk to Mr. Hasting. Yes, ma'am. But you must be sensible, Rita. I am being sensible, BJ, Just the way I like to be. Sure and at my expense. Now, you listen to me Rita. You listen to me, Sam Quigley. I've been pushed around by you two long enough. Either I get my way, or I quit. That's final. But you can't do that. Oh, can't I? Well, you just watch me. Now, now. Let's be calm. Let's not lose our head's about this thing. I'm surprised at you BJ, getting her all upset like this. Well, when she told-- Now, now, I'll take over from here. Now, Rita, why can't you be a good girl-- I am a good girl. Well, you know what I mean. Give up this silly idea of leaving us for the Denti Glow people. Haven't we made you happy here? No. We gave you a raise in salary, didn't we? So what? So-- we pay you as much as any sponsor can afford. What do we have to do to please you? Why, hasn't Mr. Hasting told you? Told me what? What is this, BJ? Well, you won't like it, Sam. She wants her salary doubled. She-- doubled? And that's only the beginning. Look, Sam. She wants the right to chose her own producer, announcer comic-- Stop. That's enough. That's enough. Are you out of your mind? Nobody's worth that money. The Denti Glow people think I am. You mean they agreed to that? All I have to do is put my name on the dotted line. Now, Rita, you can't do this to me. I can't afford it. Well, you better do it, Sam. You'll be the laughing stock of radio if she signs with some other toothpaste account. You don't have to tell me that. I know it. Think it over, Sammy Boy. And don't keep me waiting too long, or I might lose my patience and sign with Denti Glow anyhow. And you said you would bring her into line. Why didn't you do it? After all, it's your program. Yes, and costing me $15,000 a week. And for what? It's got the best rating of any show on the air. And you've still got Rita. Oh Rita. Who cares about Rita? There are plenty of singers as good as her. You can buy 'em for a dime a dozen. The woods are full of them. But she's got the name. Yeah, and the glamor. Not for me, she hasn't. But she has for 20 million radio listeners. And if you think I'm going to let a rival toothpaste manufacturer cash in on it, you're crazy. All right. All right, Sam. I'll take care of it. Now, don't worry. I don't intend to. How's that "Blue Moonlight" number for Timex, Farrell? Well, I don't know, Dick. Mr. Farrell, I'm not getting enough strings. Oh, all right. Dick, have the brass hold down a little bit. The fiddles are in the mud. Hey, when do we start? Just a minute, Ted. And incidentally, while you're on your feet, how about digging up some new gags for that script of yours. What? Go back on Joe Miller after all these years? Not a chance. Look, if those gags were good enough for my grandfather, they're good enough for me. What's the idea of rehearsing the show without me? What we're doing doesn't concern you, Rita. Doesn't concern me. I like that. The whole show is built around me, that's how little I'm concerned. Would you mind stepping outside with me a minute, Rita? I want to rehearse your lines with you, privately. What's the matter with you and the prima donna, Martin? I thought you two were pretty chummy. Ah, forget it. She looks through you like you weren't even there. I said, forget it. OK. Oh, hi, fellas. Say listen, I got a great new gag for you for the Pearly Dance Show. -OK. Shoot. All right, look, one fella says to the other, he says, you're so dumb I bet you don't know what kind of skin shoes are made out of. Now get this, the other guy says, no, but banana skins would make good slippers. All right? Huh? All right. You can't rule me out for trying. Page. Mr. Farrell wants to see you in Studio A, page. Oh, look Anne, can't you lay off of that. I was only trying to help you. Yes, you almost helped me out of a job. Look, I can explain everything if you'll only have lunch with me. -Well, I-- Yes, sir. I'll tell him right away. On your horse, Frankie. Yeah, OK. Well-- well, how about it Anne? Well, I'll think it over. Aw swell. Look, meet me in Studio A as soon as you're off. Hey, boss, we got a terrific gag for you. This I'll murder you. Don't tell me it's the gag where Rita Wilson breaks her leg and has to be shot. No gag could be that good. Now get this, you're so dumb, I bet you don't know what kind of skin shoes is made out of. No, but banana skins would make pretty good slippers. Ain't that a lark? Just a gag for the snapper. Hey, mister, you can't go in there. Why? I'm not going to hurt nothing. I know, but that's a rehearsal and ain't nobody allowed in there but people in the show. Well, maybe I'm on the show. I know you ain't in the show. I know everybody that's in that show. You can't go in there. You can't-- Listen, Banjo Eyes, I'm going through that door-- Mr. Frankie, tell this gentleman he can't go in there. Wait a minute, cowboy. What seems to be the trouble. Well, I ain't aiming to horn in on nothing, buddy. I'm from Olgalla, kind of a stranger around these parts. I ain't never seen a big broadcast before. Oh, well, this is not a broadcast. It's just a rehearsal. Oh, that don't make no difference, just as long as I can see some of them big stars at work. You reckon I could kind of go in there and watch? Well, I reckon maybe you can. But look, you got to sit in the back and be quiet. I won't make a sound. All right, come on. Hey, Jeff, you come on with us too. But Mr. Frankie, why me? Well, I want to show you how easy it is not to be afraid of a microphone. Oh, Mr. Frankie, it ain't easy for me not to be scared of nothing. You know that. Come on. All right, I'll go. Now listen, go right there and sit down and don't make any noise. Say, has anybody seen Mr. Farrell. He sent for me. He's out on the roof. Tell him to hustle it up, will you? We got to time the Wilson spot. -Right away. There's no argument. I simply want the script changed. That's impossible and you know it. We can't rewrite the script at the last minute like this simply because you don't happen to like the comic. I can't stand that man. It's impossible for me to sing under such circumstances. Now look, Rita, as the producer of this show, my reputation is at stake and you're not going to ruin it. You'll sing all right, and you'll like it. [clears throat] FRANKIE: Excuse me. What do you want? Well, Mr. Martin is ready to time Miss Wilson's song. OK. All right, Bob. I'll sing. But you won't like it. Frankie, stick around till after rehearsal. I want to talk to you. Yes, sir. All right, let's go. Places, everybody. Ready and waiting, Bob. We'll pick it up on page 10 , the tag on the Wallace routine. I've made some changes. That'll be an improvement. Quiet everybody. We're timing this. What's the idea of running around-- Hello. Hello. Didn't take you very long to get here. My feet got hot, so I turned the hose on them. Oh, I get it. Farrell, huh? Don't be silly. You're so dumb, I'll bet you don't even know what kind of skin shoes are made out of. No, but banana skin's would make pretty good slippers. My gag. Will you please lower this? Stop the music. What's the matter with you, Rita? Can't they wait until I'm ready? Oh. Well, are you ready now, Miss Wilson? Yes. All right. Start it again. [MUSIC - LORNA GRAY "DOIN' THE CONGA"] HASTINGS: What happened? Find the switch. Turn on the lights. [gunshot] [rita screams] Somebody get those lights on. Something's happened to Rita. She's been shot. Somebody watch that door. See that no one gets out. Well, do something. Don't just stand there. Get a doctor. Never mind a doctor. You better get the coroner. This girl's dead. Dead? Let me out of here. Let me out of here. Coroner's on his way up, Morty. What do you make of it? Whoever shot her knew his business, that's a cinch. Plugged straight through the heart. No powder burns. You know that gun was fired out there someplace. Lights out too. That's fancy shooting. Yeah, too fancy. All right, boys, I won't need you. You can beat it. Are you sure nobody left this studio while the lights were out? Why yes. Or after they came back on? You can see for yourself. We're all here. I don't see anything. Who's we? Why-- That's right, Lieutenant. Nobody could get out of here, even if they wanted to. No? Why not. Well, you see the doors lock automatically from inside the control booth. That's for rehearsing and broadcast too. It keeps out anybody-- Right now I'm only interested in who they keep in. Is he telling the truth? What do you mean am I telling the truth? I'm asking him. All right. He's right. Well, in that case, the murderer is still in this room. Oh, that's preposterous. These are radio people. Broadcasting is sacred to them. Why they wouldn't think-- Of course, they wouldn't. I'm stupid not to have realized that. It was suicide. When nobody was looking, she tiptoed over and switched out the lights, shot herself, swallowed the gun, and then trotted right back there to die. That's not what I meant. Well, if Rita Wilson didn't swallow the gun, who did? Just hold your horses, bud. I'm coming to that. Delaney, find that gun. It's around here somewheres. OK. FRANKIE: 10 to 1, you don't find it. No? Tell me, why not? Well, because I've looked the place over from top to bottom before you got here. And of course, you searched everybody too. Well, no. I-- I guess I forgot that, but-- holy smoke, the cowboy. What cowboy? Tex, the singing cowboy. He might carry a gun. Hey-- hey, Lieutenant, he's gone. Oh, he won't get far. Wait here, Delaney. Come on, Jeff. Excuse me, y'all, please. Wait a minute. If he used the elevator, we'll take the stairway and cut him off. -OK. Let's go. Is this a routine? You should write up a funnier one. Hey, Farrell. Quote. If you were a smart producer, you'd hook this up and shoot it out over the air. The top [inaudible] program to come out of this madhouse yet. Unquote. You must have been out of your mind. What-- what do you mean? You know what I mean. -But I didn't-- -Shh. Keep your voice down. You're safe. Hey, Miss, did a cowboy just leave here? Why, yes, Tex Martin. He just walked out. There he goes. Hey, come back here. [police siren] You shouldn't have done that, mister. You're liable to hurt somebody doing that. Where do you think you're going? Back to the hotel, I reckon. Oh, you was, eh? Well, sure, I didn't figure that killing was any of my business. Brother, you don't know how much that killing is your business. There's nothing on him, Marty. There's nothing here, boss. All right, what did you do with it? Do with what? You know, the gun, the one you killed Rita Wilson with. Oh, you've got me all wrong. I don't pack no gun. Them things are dangerous. Suppose somebody got killed? Somebody did get killed. Well, see what I mean? ABC regrets to announce that the Pearl-a-Dent program, usually on the air at this time, will not be heard tonight. An unfortunate incident this afternoon took the life of Miss Rita Wilson, knows to millions as the Pearl-a-Dent Girl. Miss Wilson was shot down by an unknown assailant during a studio rehearsal. [jazz music plays] FRANKIE: Oh, that's fine Jeff, but can't use that on the radio JEFF: No? FRANKIE: No. You see we have to-- oh, hello, Mr. Farrell. Oh, I was afraid you'd gone home. No. That cop Marty help everybody up. You want to see me? Yes. I'd like to talk to you, Frankie. Oh. Oh, I get it. I'm fired, huh? Excuse me, Mr. Farrell, I'll see you all later, if you don't mind. No, on the contrary, I-- I came to ask a favor of you, if you don't mind. Well, sure. Go ahead. Shoot. Well, you overheard Miss Wilson and me having a bit of an argument this afternoon before the-- That's right. Well, it-- it didn't really mean anything, Frankie. As a matter of fact, there was nothing to it, but you can understand how that sort of thing might look if taken in the wrong light. Yeah, sure. I understand you. You mean, it might get you in a mess, huh? Yes. There'd be a lot of embarrassing questions and, well, you realize that with my reputation as a producer I couldn't afford to. Oh. I'm way ahead of you. You mean you want me to keep my mouth shut. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. It's all right with me. Doesn't mean anything to me. I knew you'd see it the right way. Thanks a million, Frankie. I won't forget it. Oh, Mr. Farrell. Yes? Say, who you going to get to fill Rita Wilson's spot? Well, I-- I hadn't thought about it. It's a little early for that, don't you think? Yeah, but look, when you do think about it, will you keep Anne Mason in mind? She's got a wonderful voice. Certainly. Thanks for reminding me. As her to come and see me. We'll talk about it. -Right. -Good night. Good night. I'm sure glad you didn't come out first. Say, what that Mr. Farrell man want? Is you in trouble again? -No. No. He just invited me over to his house for a game of checkers. Checkers? Checkers? Now, ain't that something. Mr. Frankie, one of these days you going to try me too far. Well, look, pull yourself together, will you? We've got a lot of work to do. I want to go over this knew routine of ours. But Mr. Frankie, between me working here in this studio all day and running around all night helping you, well, I ain't getting no sleep. Well, a growing boy like you doesn't need any. I know. But just growing wears me to a frazzle. Look, you got your script? -Oh, I got that right here. -OK. I got to get something for a mic. Mic? Does you have to? Are you still scared of a microphone? Every time I see one of them things I get the jitters all inside of myself. Well, look, we gotta break you of that. Now, look at that microphone. That ain't no microphone. That's a mop. I know. I know. But look, can't you pretend it's a mic? Now, go on, look at it. Now, you still scared? Oh, Mr. Frankie, how do you expect for me to be afraid of something that's closer to me then my own brother? Yeah, I never thought of that. Wait a minute, I got an idea. Uh oh, I don't like to looks in your eyes when you say you got an idea. That means trouble. I got just the thing. Uh oh, whatever it is, I ain't going to do it. I ain't going to do it. I ain't going to do it. I ain't going to do it, Mr. Frankie. No sir, I ain't going to do it, because right there is where Miss Wilson got killed. -Quiet down, will you, Jeff? What do you want to do, wake the dead? Wake the dead? Mr. Frankie, ain't I got enough on my mind without you putting ideas in my head? Jeff, do you mean to tell me you're actually afraid of Rita Wilson's ghost? It ain't the ghost, it's the person that made her a ghost. That's what's bothering me. Boy, you're terrific. Come on, let's rehearse this thing. We want to get out of here sometime tonight. Go ahead. Mr. Frankie, I've been thinking. Uh oh. I don't think I want to be-- FRANKIE: Now, wait a minute, Jeff. There's nothing the matter with you, you're just afraid of that microphone. That's all. -That ain't all. Where's-- Well, now look, you want to be a success, don't you? You don't want to be a janitor all your life. Well, at least I get paid for being a janitor. Well, sure you get paid. Yeah but look, if you're on the radio, think of the glamour. People clamoring for your-- Now-- now wait a minute, Mr. Frankie, that lady Miss Wilson had glamour. Look at her now. That work is too dangerous. You tell me something, will you, Jeff? What would you do if you didn't have anything to be scared of? What I would-- Never mind. Look, let's rehearse this thing. We want to go home sometime tonight. Well, if I've got to, I've just got to do it. Well then start reading, will you? Mr. Frankie, it's your first line. Oh. Yeah, that's right. All right, you ready? No, I'm ready. Morning Rastis, How you feel? Morning, Moe. I sick. Sick? Boy, you is always complaining about-- Mr. Frankie. You don't expect me to speak in no dialect, do you? No, no. You read yours just plain. You're the straight man. Oh. Now that's different. Come on now, let's start again. Morning, Rastis, how you feel? Morning, Moe. I-- I sick. Sick? Boy, you is always complaining about-- Mr. Frankie, it's a little hot in here. Let's go outside, huh? Yeah, it is kind of warm. No, wait a minute. I'll fix the ventilator. Oh. No wonder it won't work. Hey, Jeff, come here, quick. Yes sir. Look in here. Goodness, is that a gun? Yeah. Must be the one that killed Rita Wilson. Pretty smart, huh? It was probably put in there while the lights were out. A gun and me ain't got no business in the same room. I'll see you. Uh oh. Hey, Jeff, wait a minute. Hold the phone. What are you two doing in here? Well, we were just-- What's that? The gun you've been looking for. Oh, trying to hide it, eh? Ah, now, wait a minute. You certainly live up your reputation as a cop, don't you? You suspect everybody. It's my business suspecting people. Where did you find it? Come on over here and I'll show you. Right there in that ventilator. Must have been put there after the murder. Ah, no wonder we couldn't find it. How do we know you didn't put it there? Yeah. How do we know he didn't sneak back here tonight and try to grab it off when you thought nobody was around? We caught you right in the act, didn't we? Now wait a minute. Settle down. Where do you get that stuff? It's a good thing you used your head and picked this gun up with your handkerchief, because if your fingerprints are on it-- -And what if they are? Now, wait a minute now. Where y'all going to take us? -Police headquarters. What for? We didn't do nothing. Look at that. And that. Well, we've got let you go. Yep, it wasn't your fingerprints. Well, don't have to look so disappointed about it. Mr. Lieutenant, do that mean that we is free again? Did we ain't murder? Well, to an extent, yes. But don't leave town. No, sir. Well, what makes you think we'd want to leave town? Well, you've nosed out all the other answers. Try dipping your beak into that one. Now, listen, Marty. Don't call me-- All right, all right. Lieutenant. Come on. Paging Mr. Waters. Paging Mr. Waters. Mr. Waters in studio B, please. Oh, hello, Tex. Hiya. FRANKIE: Paging Mr. Waters. Well, good morning, Tex. Morning, Miss Anne. My you look happy. Get some good news? I sure did. Mr. Farrell's going to let me audition for him this morning. Oh Tex, that's wonderful. It's about time you had a chance. You've waited long enough. Well, we both have, Miss Anne. Maybe you'll be next. Well, I hope so. Good luck, Tex. Ah, thank you. Well, that cowboy don't waste any time, does he? What do you mean? Well, he's always hanging around you, always talking to you. What's he want, anyhow? I think that's none of your business. Oh, well pardon me. But if you must know, he was telling me about his audition. Audition? For who, Farrell? Yes, Page. Mr. Farrell is going to hear him this morning. Oh, Mr. Farrell, is it? Well, I guess that puts me in my place. Well, you asked for it. Yeah. Paging Mr. Waters. Any mail for us, beautiful? Oh, I'll see. Oh, hello, Mr. Pringle. Listen, I got another great gag for you. Stow it, kid. We ain't buying gags anymore. We're off the air. Off the air? Yeah, Wallace quit this morning. But he couldn't-- Ah, but he did. And now we're on relief. Ain't that cute? Gee, I'm sorry. But look-- Watch your job, kid. We might start angling for it. No mail, Mr. Pringle. Thanks. So long. Good luck. Hey Anne, did you hear that? Well, what about it? What about it? That means they need a new comic to the Pearly Dent Show, doesn't it? -Yes. -Well? Well what? Frankie, not you. Well, who else? Why not? Look, Jeff and I have got a swell comedy act worked up. Does Mr. Farrell know about this? Well, no, but don't you worry. It's in the bag. Well, just make sure you don't wind up in the bag. Keep your fingers crossed. Say is he kidding? [MUSIC - GORDON JONES "OH, BURY ME NOT ON THE LONE PRAIRIE"] Nice, cheerful little diddy. Yeah. Now I know why they call them lone cowboys. Heard enough? Plenty. [MUSIC - GORDON JONES "OH, BURY ME NOT ON THE LONE PRAIRIE"] That'll do, Mr. Barton. Thank you very much. Well, I'm not through yet. I got a lot more to do. Well, we've heard all that we require. We'll let you know if we can use you. How much more of this torture? One more coming up. Presenting the two Blackbirds, Rastis and Moe. Hey, what goes on here? Morning, Rastis, how's you all? Morning, Moe. I sick. Boy, you is always complaining about something that you ain't even got and couldn't have it if you did have it. Boy, I got it. You got what? A kind of a feeling that starts-- I had that once. You mean the kind of a feeling of starts in the head and walks around-- That's it. Yeah? What you doing for it? Well, I seen myself a doctor and he give me a bottle of-- Don't take them, they'll kill you. Now, why don't you try-- I tried two boxes of them. They didn't do me no good. Then why don't you go see a doctor-- That quack? I had him. You see, he's one of these kind of doctors-- Yeah, yeah I know I know. Well look, in that case, what you need is a cutting doctor. You know, a sturgeon? A man who can cooperate on yous. You know, one that takes a knife and he cuts you here-- I had mine taken out last year. Oh, you did, huh? Well look, what else do you think maybe could be wrong with you? Well, you see, I thought maybe it was-- Oh no, no, no, no. You all wrong. Couldn't be that. Now look, why don't you try some of them pills, you know, that my brother took when he was suffering from what he caught when he was-- Was he out there? I thought all the time he was going to go-- Yeah, he did. But he done come back. What's he doing now? Well, you see, he's working again. Where? Well, he's got a job. And boy, do you know he's making a salary of-- That ain't no money at all. Yeah, I know, and that poor devil, he's fixing to get married. Look here, Mr. Frankie. You've got to talk slower if you want me to keep up with you. I can't talk that fast, Mr. Frankie. Who is he going to marry? Well, don't you know? He's going to marry the daughter of-- She's a nice girl. All right. Break it up, you two. What's the matter, boss? I thought we was doing pretty fine. You know better then to try a stunt like this. Well now, just a minute, Mr. Farrell-- You think I wouldn't recognize you behind this stuff? Don't touch me. I don't rub off. Ah, Frankie. This is taking things a little too far. After all, I agreed one audition, but not-- Yeah, but Mr.-- I mean, Mr. Farrell, we knew you needed two new comics for the Pearl-a-Dent Show, so we just thought that-- Uh oh. Here come that man again. Sorry to bust in like this. Not at all. Were you-- were you looking for me? Tex Barton. They told me he was here. Well, uh, he just left here, Lieutenant. Who's he? Who's who? You. Frankie, don't you remember? What happened to you? Fall in a coal bin? Yeah. I think I did. You should have passed him in the hall. He must be in the building somewhere. Thanks. Hey Lieutenant, wait a minute! Hey, Marty. My name's Lieutenant Phillips. Don't forget that. Yeah, OK. What did you want with Tex Barton? Were those his fingerprints on the gun? Don't know yet, but it was his gun. We got a wire back on the serial number. Well-- well then he's the killer. Well, you can't tell. He did time back in Cheyenne. Used the same gun in a shooting scrape over some woman. What's her name, Delaney? Wharton, Gladys Wharton. Yeah, that's it. Oh. Thanks a lot, Marty. I mean Lieutenant. Come on, Delaney. Wharton, Gladys Wharton. Oh, Jeff, have you seen Frankie? Yessum, there he is. -That? -Yes. And it's not funny. Here Frankie. Take these contacts over to Mr. Hastings office and wait for an OK. Right. Come on, Jeff. Say, now's a good time to sell our act to Mr. Hastings. Yeah, but we've already been beat to him once by Mr. Farrell. Oh, quit beefing. Come on. Wonder what this is all about. I don't know, but this ain't no place for me. Come here. Pull yourself together. Something's all wrong. Where's Mr. Hastings? Don't look at me. I ain't got him. Come on, Jeff. Let's take a look around. Tex Barton. Jeff, he's dead. I'm glad you left that door open. We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin. Death once again stalked the halls of amalgamated broadcasting company today, striking down Tex Barton, cowboy troubadours. Detective Lieutenant Marty Phillips, in charge of the investigation, believes the crime to be the work of the mysterious assailant who less than 24 hours before took the life of Rita Wilson, beautiful ABC singing star. What bothers me is why in an institution of this size, nobody heard the shot when gun was fired. Oh well, that's easy, Lieutenant. Yeah, with you everything is easy. Well you see, all these rooms are soundproof. Well, that could account for it. Which reminds me, how does it happen you're always on deck every time a murder's committed around here? Well, coincidence I guess. Yeah? Well, men have been convicted and hung on the strength of coincidence. Don't forget that. And you say you two were auditioning at the time of the murder? Yes. That's right. And you claim you were in his office across the street when it happened? Yes. Yes I was. That's right. We were looking over some contracts. I can prove it. That leaves you, Ms. Mason. I know. I know. You were listening to the Swing Parade broadcast. But I-- And you can prove it. Where were you? I-- I was in the coincident with Mr. Frankie. Well, if this ain't as neat a set of alibies as I've ever heard. Well, it'll be off and now you can go. But don't anybody leave this building without checking with me first. And don't try anything funny. And that goes double for you. Yes sir. Oh, Frankie. Look, you-- you won't say anything about-- Oh no. Don't worry about that. Oh fine. But listen, don't you forget Anne's audition. Oh that's right. I'll tell you what, you-- you have in the audition room in half an hour and I'll hear her then. That's the stuff. [MUSIC - MARJORIE REYNOLDS "SOMEHOW OR OTHER"] Not bad. Very good. Well, she's all right. [MUSIC - MARJORIE REYNOLDS "SOMEHOW OR OTHER"] Was I all right? Honey, you can sing for me anytime. Quigley doesn't sign you up, he's crazy. Crazy, am I? Like a fox. That girl is great. I'm going to sign her up. Oh but, Sam she's a green kid. She's had no experience. Well, that's what I like about her. Get her in here. OK. Oh, gee, Anne. That was marvelous. You were great. You sure was, Ms. Anne. You sing that like nobody's business. Oh, I hope so. You think Mr. Farrell will like it? Well, how can he help but like it? Well, Anne, you're in. You made it. -Really? Yes. Mr. Hastings just called. What did I tell you? He and Mr. Quigley would like to see you in the clan's room right away. -Well, come on. What are we waiting for? Hey, where do you think you're going? Well, with Anne. Oh, well what? I'm her agent. She's the greatest discovery I've ever had. Yes, I know, Frankie. But under the circumstances, don't you think you'd better me handle it? Oh, but gee, Mr. Farrell-- I think maybe he's right, Frankie. Oh. Yeah sure. OK. Good luck. I guess we got the brush off. how do you like that? How do you like that? But Mr. Frankie. Wait. How do you like that? I arranged for the whole audition, I get her all set. What happens to me, yeah, I'm a smart guy. I wind up behind the eight-ball. Is you talking about me? No. Jeff, I'm through with women. Absolutely through with them, especially singers. That's the best idea you had yet. Cause singers don't last long on this network. No, sir. You said it. But you know, Jeff, gee I'd hate to see anything happen to Anne. I mean like-- Like what happened to Miss Wilson and Mr. Tex? Yeah. You know, somebody has to catch those killers. Looks like it's going to have to be us. Yeah, not so heavy on that us. You go find them killers. Them killers ain't finding me, and I ain't giving them no help by finding them first. Jeff. I've got it. We've got a date. I got a date right here with a broom and I'm gonna keep it. No, you haven't. Go on, change your clothes. Does I has too? Go on and change your clothes. Am I going to have trouble with you? Changing clothes, sir. Stella, have those cops left yet? Well, I haven't seen them, Frankie. Look, have you got Tex Barton's home address there? Sure. Give it to me, will ya? Well, now, look, Frankie, this isn't another one of your brain storms? -Never mind that. This is an important. Well, it's Room 203 at the Walsh Hotel. Swell. Thanks a lot. Come on. Oh my goodness. Tex killed in Mr. Hastings office. It just don't make sense. Don't none of it make no sense to me. Well, if Tex did kill Rita, who killed Tex and why? Why ask me riddles, Mr. Frankie? Why should I know? I was just thinking out loud. Uh oh. Say, you don't suppose Mr. Hastings could have killed Tex or Rita, do you? I don't think so, cause Mr. Hasting is an awful nice man. Yeah, that's the way I had it figured, but I don;t know, the finger seems to point to him. But Mr. Frankie, If you don't be careful, the finger's gonna be pointing at you, and-- If I could only get my hands of one good clue. Like what, for instance? Like getting a line on that girl that Tex was mixed up with in Cheyenne. What was her name? Gladys Wharton. I don't know the lady. Well, I'd like to. I think she's the answer to the whole shooting match. That's one answer I don't want to know. Well, if my hunch is right, we're about to find out. Here it is here. [WHISPERING] Uh, Mr. FRankie-- Sh. 203. This is it. If you ask me, we's it. There's nobody in. How can you expect Mr. Tex to be home if he's dead? I wasn't thinking of Tex, stupid. Did it ever occur to you that somebody else might have the same idea? But if anybody else ain't got it, the idea must not be no good. I'm going. Now, wait a minute. This is the break I've been waiting for. We're going in. Ain't that trespassing? And besides, ain't the door locked? Yeah, but this skeleton key is the answer to that. You always got the answer to everything. Come on Mr. Frankie, you got me in here, now what's I gonna do? Now, look, get busy. If I know Marty Phillips, he won't be long in finding this place himself. You examine the bed. I'm gonna look through the drawers. Yes, sir. You never can tell what you'll find. Might be something big. Looky here. Looky here. Tex's suitcase. Boy, let me at it. Oh, them ain't nothing but papers. What did you expect to find, a dead body? Well, wouldn't nothing surprise me lately the way we been going. I done got plum scared to open my dinner bucket anymore. Hey, listen, if these papers are what I think they are, it's better than finding gold. Mr. Frankie, you sure got a funny sense of value. Looky here. Now, ain't that something? Anne's picture. Then my eyes didn't fool me after all. Look at that. A telegram too. I can't believe it. Yet they tie up, the picture, the telegram, she must be Gladys Wharton. Well, you don't mean to say she killed that cowboy, do you? Oh, Jeff, I don't know what to think. Looks bad. Look, don't you say anything to anybody, not even Anne. Oh, you know me. You know, if she did-- well, if she did, she must have had a good reason. You know, Jeff, we've got to help her. Yes,sir. Greetings, kiddies. I know it was gonna happen. I know it. I suppose this is a coincidence too? Well, no, not exactly. You see, we kind of liked Tex so we thought we'd come up in his room and gather up the things and, well, send them home. Sure. I know. A very noble gesture. You wanted to help him so much you tore his room apart doing it. It's robbery, all right, Marty. No doubt about it. It's as plain as the nose on you face. But-- uh. Marvelous, Delaney. Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without you around to tell me these things. Yes, sir. All right, kids, spill it. What did you find? We didn't find anything. I just thought that-- Well, suppose you start thinking of a nice cozy room behind bars, because that's where you're going to wind up if you don't start talking fast. Well, what makes you think we found anything? That look on your face, like the cat that ate the canary. You ain't kidding nobody. OK. You win, Marty. And my name's Lieutenant Phillips, not Marty. Oh, holding back evidence, eh? Anne Mason. And a telegram from Gladys Wharton. Very interesting. You wouldn't be trying to protect your little girlfriend now, would ya? Well, uh, no. That's my picture. She gave it to me. Get away. This belongs to the state now. In the case of the People versus Gladys Wharton. What do you mean? I mean, for my money, Anne Mason murdered Tex Barton. Bring them along, Delaney. Hey, wait a minute, you know, Jeff and I didn't look this place over very good. Aren't you gonna look around and see if we overlooked anything? Yeah. I think you got something there. They locked us in. Break it open. Open this door! Anne, Anne, wait a minute. Oh, Frankie, I've got the most wonderful news. Never mind that. Listen, I got to talking to you right away. Come on out on the roof. Go on, Jeff. Well, what's the matter, Frankie? What's wrong? -Everything's wrong. Marty's wise to the whole shebang. Wise to what? I don't understand. That picture and the telegram, he found them. What picture? What telegram? Oh, you know, Anne, the picture you gave Tex Barton. Oh, that. Oh, that? Listen, you're on a spot. Oh, don't be silly. I knew Tex before. He'd work with some of the smaller radio stations and when he heard I was out of a job, why he took my picture around. Well, look, that's all right with me, but you're going to have a hard time making Marty believe it. Don't you realize, he thinks you killed Tex. And he's coming up here to make an arrest right now. Well, that's awful. Well, I can't believe it. You better believe it, because he's not fooling. He sure ain't, Miss Anne. But my contract, I just signed it. Forget about your contract. The best thing for you to do is to get out of here as quick as you can. Find a place to hide-- And I know just the place. The county jail. You're under arrest, Miss Mason. Or should I Wharton? And I'm taking you along with her. Me? What for? For locking me in that room. OK, Marty, we'll go with ya. But you're sure gonna look like a chump when the papers tell how we made a monkey out of you. Come on. Don't worry, Ann, we'll do everything we can for ya. Now, there's a guy that's a credit to the police force. It ain't fair, Mr. Frankie. Here it is way past my dinner time and I'm starving to death and there you is reading a book. All right, be quiet, will ya? I'll be through in a minute. That's what I've been telling my stomach but it keeps on arguing. Here's one, look. Robert Farrell, radio producer, formally in New York. Well, no Cheyenne. He's out. No, he ain't. I just seen him come in. Look, look at this one. BJ Hastings, radio executive, formally owner of WRW in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Jeff, that's it. We've got it. You mean, Mr. Hastings is the killer? Well, he could be, but gee, it's hard to believe. Look, if Anne knew him in Cheyenne, then she's in on the whole deal. Now, of we could only talk to her, and find out-- My goodness, she is the killer. No, Anne, couldn't kill anybody. No? She-- well, she's not the type. Where we going? To see Anne. Down to the jailhouse? Well, certainly. Oh, Mr. Frankie, this is one summer that I thought I was gonna get some fresh air. You'll get plenty of it. Come on. OK. Goodbye. Hiya, Marty. How many times have I got to tell you my name is Lieutenant Phillips? And if you're looking for any clues, I ain't got any. You're telling me. I told you-- I'm sorry, Marty, they slipped past me. It's all right, Delaney. All right, kid, get it off your chest. Well, it's nothing, I, uh, just wanted to see Anne. What makes you think I'd let you see her? Well, as a taxpayer, it's my privilege. Hey, wait a minute, you don't pay taxes. Well, I will someday. So couldn't I see her now on account? Delaney. Wait a minute. You can't throw me out. I gotta right to see Anne. Well, she ain't here. She ain't here? We released her on bail a half an hour ago. You released her on bail? We released her on bail. Well, who did it? Who did it, Marty? Who got her out? Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. You mean, you don't know? The deal was handled by Max Creager, a bail broker. Wouldn't give his client's name. He wouldn't, huh? Marty, do you realize what this means? It means I've got too much on my mind right now to worry about it. Now, will ya please-- Now, look, Anne didn't kill Tex, and if she is Gladys Wharton, she knows too much. So the killer gets her out of jail so he can murder her. Maybe he's got something there, Marty. Yeah, I kno-- say, if that's straight, that girl's life means less with every tick of the clock. We gotta find her. Listen, there's a chance she might have gone to the studio. She's supposed to be on the Pearl-a-Dent hour. Well, it's a long one, but we'll try it. Say, Marty, you know, I've been thinking. -Uh-oh. -Well, stop it. Every time you start to think, I got a headache. You get a headache? Every time he starts to thinking, I get a nervous concussion. Quiet down, Jeff. Look, Marty, I don't think Anne is Gladys Wharton. No, then who is? Well, how about Rita Wilson? No, you're crazy. We looked up Anne Mason's record. She hails from a little town about 50 miles outside of Cheyenne. Yeah? I didn't know that. Oh, nice of you to admit it. Say, look, did you know that Mr. Hastings comes from down there too? Where did you find that out? Oh, I looked it up in the radio yearbook. He used to own a station down there. Them maybe he's the one we're looking for. I don't know who we're looking for. This case gets more mixed up every time I blink my eyes. How about it, Marty? How about what? How about Mr. Hastings? How about shutting up so I can think? Step on it, Delaney. Right. Excuse me, miss, I,uh-- Stella, have you seen Anne? Why, yes, She came in a minute ago with Mr. Farrell. Farrell? That's all I want to know. Farrell, I want to talk to you. Oh, hello, Lieutenant. You still on the job? What have you done with Anne? I haven't seen her. The girl at the desk said you come in with her a while ago. She must be confused. I think you're the one that's confused, mister. Now, are you going to tell us where she is? Well, I-- yes, I did come in with her, but I don't know where she is now. That's a fact. MARTY: It better be. It is, and now, if you gentlemen will excuse me. the Pearl-a-Dent show goes on in half an hour and I-- Oh, no, you don't. You're staying right here with me. What about Mr. Hastings? Will you get that idea out of your head? Now, I'm getting to the bottom of this thing, once and for all. Delaney, round up everybody and have them in the client's room in 15 minutes. And that goes for you too. Yes, sir. Jeff-- Uh oh. What's been the matter with me? That's just what I've been trying of figure out. The teletype. I should have thought of that a long time ago. Well, here's hoping it works. Here's hoping we don't get caught. We've got them. It's coming through. You don't say so. Mr. Frankie, you sure is a genius. Yeah, Jeff, Tex used to do a singing act with a blond girl named Gladys Wharton. Jeff, it's beginning to click. Rita Wilson used to be a blond. What do you know about that? Says they both left town hurriedly after a shooting scrape with some radio executive. Who was the radio executive? It's gone dead, and just when we were going to find out something important. You don't think a ghost did that, do ya? No. That machine went off too conveniently. Say, this one's connected with the machine in the newsroom, isn't it? I wonder. You wait here, Jeff. Alone? With all these ghosts? Mr. Frankie-- Hey, where the fire? Listen, I'm on the trail of something hot. Come on, follow me. Somebody slugged him. Jeff? Jeff, wake up. Is that where I think I is? Or is that where I hope I am? Oh, my head. What happened, Jeff? I was standing over there looking at that machine, wasn't hurting nobody, boom, I gets it. I know'd it was going to happen to me, Mr. Frankie. I know'd it. It's gone all right. Delaney. He must have come in here from the news room and grabbed that tape and then went out the other way. Yeah? Did anybody enter or leave this room? Nobody but you, the kid, and the porter there. Thanks. Must have used this door. Where does it lead to? Well, to a hall that leads to the sponsors room. Well, let's go. Y'all go ahead. I'll stay here and recooperate. Has anybody left here? Don't ask me. I didn't notice anybody. Now, listen here, Lieutenant-- Quiet, quiet. Speak your peace, Frankie. Well, I just checked with station WRW in Cheyenne, and I think I've got the low down on who killed Tex Barton and Rita Wilson. What-- What did you find? Well, the way I've got it figured, you see, Rita was Tex's wife, and well, she ran out on him for some big radio executive. What? And just who is this big executive? Well, I don't know yet. It was just coming over the teletype when somebody tore the tape. But I've got a new line on him. Now, as I see it-- All right, get 'em up everybody. First man that moves follows the same route that Text took. Nice work, Frankie. I killed Rita, sure. I found out she was throwing me over for someone else. What about the cowboy? We was the only one who knew about Rita and me. I had to get rid of him too. All right, I'm in this thing pretty deep. Don't try anything. One or two more won't make any difference to me now. Oh, Mr. Frankie! Good work, Jeff. Gimme that. Thought you'd get away with it, huh? Take him down, Delaney. It's our pleasure. Come on, you. ANNOUNCER: Presenting the Pearl-a-Dent hour. The broadcast, where's Anne? Now, where do you think? ANNOUNCER: Presenting for the first time on the air, the girl who was destined to become radio's new singing sensation, Anne Mason. Well, how do you like that? Practically sitting right in my lap, and I didn't know it. Sure. You didn't think I'd leave her running around, so you could throw her back in jail again, did ya? [MUSIC - LORNA GRAY, "DOIN' THE CONGA"] She's my discovery, you know? [MUSIC - LORNA GRAY, "DOIN' THE CONGA"] Well, Mr. Quigley? She's in, Frankie. Ah, swell, thanks a lot. [MUSIC - LORNA GRAY, "DOIN' THE CONGA"] Well, what do you think of our new find, Marty? For the last time, my name's Marty. Shake. Shake, Lieutenant. Say, you're all right, Frankie. You know, I suspected Martin as soon as you started talking. Guilt written all over his face. But tell me, how did you figure it was him? Well, to tell you the truth, I didn't. He had me fooled too. I thought it was Mr. Hastings. What? You're-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I'll be seeing ya. Me too. Hey, Jeff, wait for me. [music playing]
