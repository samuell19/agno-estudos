"This movie is based on..." "...an accident in Parit Buntar in 1972." "Any resemblance to actual events..." "...or persons is purely coincidental." -Hi Boss. -Hello. Your hotel looks brand new. Not really. It has been seven or eight years. Is there a vacant room? Yes there is, please give me your identity card. OK, thank you. Just walk up from here. Be careful. "Rumor says that a couple gave birth" "to 17 children to pay for the sin." Hey Ah Fu. They're in the news again. Are they expecting another baby? Yes, time flies. We have prayers every year, but they're still haunting us. You're right. I hear children cries every night. Really? The kids should be taken to get rid of the bad spirits. That's so scary. Boss. The latest model is much smaller. Do people still use this old model? There are many old-fashioned people. There will be people buying them. Hey pretty girl. It's you again. 17 sets of school uniform. I knew it. OK, thank you. Why are you buying so many school uniforms at once? She's weird. Go and do your work. Mind your own business. Having this kind of staff... ...is really a headache. Dad. It must be your mom telling you to buy these. Dad, look. They're taking photos of us again. Just ignore them. Mom. I bought it. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Dad, someone is looking for you. Yi Hui. How are you? Where is Ah Mei? Ah Mei. Look who is here? Ah Mei, how are you? I'm Yi Hui. I really don't understand. Look at your situation now. Why do you still want to have so many children? Do you realize that children need... ...a good environment to grow up? If the welfare department finds out, they will definitely take the children away. I will think of a way... Wake your siblings up. Follow me. Yi Hui. Yi Hui! Come. Come with me. It's time to pay it back. It's finally time to pay it back. Mom. What are you doing? Mom! Don't do it! Mom! Don't do it! -Mom! -Ah Mei! Are you out of your mind? Ah Mei! Are you crazy? They are your children! I must pay my debt. I must pay it back to the 17 children. I must pay it back to Sister Lan. Sister Lan lied to you. Sister Lan is already dead! Sister Lan is dead! -Mom! -Ah Mei! -Mom! -Ah Mei! Dad. We're finally home. Uncle. Thank you. You're welcome. I only have four sets left. When will there be stock? Tomorrow. Please reserve 13 sets for me. No problem. Sister Lan. This is the latest TV model. Do you want one? Boss. Sister Lan always buy so many school uniforms. Who are those for? Mind your own business. Go and do your work. Having this kind of staff is really troublesome. Send the other goods to the riverside Yi Hui. You didn't follow us to the press conference. What a waste. A pack of biscuit and many product samples for everyone. That's right. Yi Hui. Assistant supervisor. Supervisor has asked you to amend this part. Why haven't you amended it? The news of missing donation... It's not fair for the victims. If we take out this part from the article, this news will be meaningless. These kind of articles is going to offend some people. -There's no point in doing that. -Yes. As journalists, we should report the truth... ...and present it to the readers. Am I wrong? Recently I heard rumors saying there are kids running on the street at night... ...and they don't have heads. This kind of news will definitely get the attention of readers! What do you mean? The deceased became wandering ghosts. If the family of victims heard that, how would they feel? I'm going out. Good morning. These are the information you are looking for. Please see if they are what you want. Just what I needed, thank you. What? You saw a ghost? Where is the ghost? Who saw the ghost? Come and say it in front of me! It's true! People are saying they saw ghosts. We must invite a Taoist priest to conduct prayers. The intention of having this memorial... ...is to remind everyone of lesson from the accident, not to spread rumors around. Let's make this clear. I'm not trying to cause trouble. I just want everyone to feel calm. I just want everyone to feel at ease. Am I right? Calm? Peace of mind? To make who feeling at ease? All these years, families of the victims has suffered so much. Here you are spreading rumors of seeing ghosts. If you want everyone to feel at ease, please keep your mouth shut, alright? It's not that... Haven't you said enough? Mr Zhao is right. Please don't be so superstitious. That's right. Mankind have landed on moon many years ago. Yet you are still being so superstitious. This is so ridiculous. Mr Zhao. I'm a journalist from Sin Pin Daily. Can I do an interview with you? Mr Zhao... It's getting dark. Why are you still sitting here? Where do you stay? Are you not from this town? It will be dangerous to stay here at night. Follow me. Where are you going? Let's get a place for you to stay. Come in. Don't be afraid. I work here. How much for one night? I'll talk to the boss. Ask him to give you some discount. Boss, she wants to stay for a night. I know her, can you give her a better price? Small room, RM20 will do. What smell is that? Smells like mud. It's so smelly. Yes. Where does the smell come from? I'm serious. It smells like river. The praying ceremony is happening soon. It must be those things... I'm not surprised. I heard rumors recently. They saw those things. Don't talk nonsense. You should stay here tonight. Thank you, aunty. Everyone calls me Sister Lan. What are you doing here? You should take a bath. I'll get a new bed sheet for you. It's time for dinner. Ah Mei... Let's go. We are leaving here. Daddy, where are we going? I don't know, but we must leave this place. Lets go. My doll! Come, lets go! I'll buy you a new one. It's getting late. Don't wander around. Who are they? My parents. Sister Lan. When are you leaving? Leave? Where should I go? Back to where you came from. My mom passed away ten years ago. My dad passed away last week. This is where I am from. I want to stay here. This is not a place you should stay. After all these years of suffering, it's not easy for me. You should leave as soon as possible. Why? It's for your own good. Hey. Stop daydreaming. Go and deliver the goods. Boss, are you hiring? Boss, are you hiring? No. Aren't you local? Where are you from? I grew up here but... I moved out when I was ten. Really? What are your parents' names? My mom is Ah Siu. My dad is Ah Han. Ah Han? The bus driver? Yes. But... ...both of them have passed away. She's Ah Han's daughter! We should mind our own business. I'm not hiring. Please leave... Sorry. We're not hiring. She's Ah Han's daughter. Ah Fu. Fatty told me when he walked by the riverside last night. He heard children cries. This is not news anymore. All these years, many people have heard of it. Some even saw it. After all these years, they still linger around the river. Go! Go away! I'm working, go away! I said go away!! I'm doing my business! Play over there. Go! Go! Go and play over there, go over there. Ah Mei. Are you Ah Mei? Don't run! Don't run! Watch your steps, young lady! Are you OK? Do you need to lodge a police report? Don't worry. I'm a reporter. My name is Lin Yi Hui. Do you need to lodge a police report? Miss. Why did you scream? On the bed... How many times have I told you, don't go into people's room. Come on. Let's go back to our room. Come. Sister Lan. What's wrong? I saw those people praying by the riverside. Is this town haunted? More than ten years ago, an accident happened at the river. Many lives were lost. You don't know anything about it? I don't care if you know. Please leave this place! Kids... They're here. They're here. They're here. Don't come near me. It wasn't me. -It wasn't me. -Dad! Dad! Stay away from me! Dad! Stop chasing me! Dad! Dad! "Sin Pin Daily." Miss. You.... How can I help you? I'm looking for... -Yi Hui. -Yi Hui? Yi Hui went out to the riverside to conduct interview. Master, what time shall we start? Yes, it's almost time. Let's start at 5 in the evening. Mr Zhao... He's well-known in our town. Yes! The Taoist priest said he's well known in Parit Buntar. Yes, that's right. Let's prepare now. Let's prepare and start soon. Aunty. Why are you crying? My grandson... He was washed away in this river. Washed away? Don't you know about it? More than ten years ago, the ferry sank in this river. Many lives were lost. On that day, it was raining heavily in the morning. I told him to stay home, but he said there's an exam. He must go to school. That morning, he went out... ...and never came back. Aunty... Don't be sad. Are you from other town? I was born here, but ten years ago, I moved out from here. Where did you stay? My home was on the 11th road, right by the big tree. Isn't that Ah Han's house? Ah Han is my dad. You know him? Aunty, what's wrong? She... Who are you? She is Ah Han's daughter! On that day, your father caused that incident... ...and ran away! Yes, more than ten kids died. They lost their lives because of that. Yes! He caused the death of the students and ran away! Everyone, stay calm. Please leave, you are not welcome here. Go away! Sister Lan. What did my father do? Why does everyone hate him? Didn't I tell you? Your father caused the death of the students. That ferry sank more than ten years ago. Your father was driving 17 students. The bus sunk into the river, and your father escaped... ...without saving any of the kids. All of them died. It's your father's fault. No. My dad is not a killer! If your dad didn't kill them, why did he run away? Don't you understand? Many lives were lost because of him. You can't stay here. I have... ...nowhere to go. You must leave no matter what! All of them died! Those students... ...died in such a tragic manner, with their spirits yet to be calmed. Hello. You found it? Library? Thank you. You scared me. Boss. Are those student uniforms back in stock? Yes, there are here. Take 13 sets for Sister Lan. Sister Lan, do you want some joss sticks? It's the time of the year for the praying ceremony. No. Recently, the town is not so peaceful. You should go and pray this year. It doesn't guarantee peaceful. I have lived here for decades. There's nothing I haven't seen before. I'm afraid of nothing. Close the door! Close the door! Sister Lan. Can you do me a favor? Can you ask the kids to come out? I have some questions to ask them. Are they here? Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. The driver... ...killed all of you. The driver killed all of you! The driver killed all of you! The driver killed all of you! Impossible. My father is not a killer! The driver killed all of you! Impossible! My father is not a killer! The driver killed all of you! The driver killed all of you! The driver killed all of you! The driver killed all of you! My father is not a killer! The driver killed all of you! Don't cry. Is that you? Dad. Dad. Dad! Please don't disturb Ah Mei. Please bless Ah Mei. Don't accuse my dad. He's not a killer. He's not a killer. Bring my father back! Ah Mei! Ah Mei! Ah Mei, are you alright? Ah Mei. What happened? What are you doing here? Many kids... All of them wear school uniform. They're here for revenge. What kids? What revenge? It's my dad, he killed them. That's why they're coming after me. Ah Mei, listen to me. Look at me and listen to me. In this world, there's no ghost. You're just too tired. It's your illusion. I saw it. All those kids were dead. My dad killed them. That's why they are coming after me. Sister Lan asked me to leave, but I don't want to go. I have nowhere to go. It's alright. Don't worry. No matter what happens, I will help you. Don't be afraid. I will help you too. I have prayed. I prayed for the god to bless you. It's alright. Let's go back and get some rest, come on. I'll pay for 3 nights now. If she wants to stay for more, let her stay, I'll foot the bill later on. OK. No problem. Here. This is for you. Are you Tan Kim Fu? I have been waiting for you. You're finally back. Ah Mei, I have paid for the room. You can continue to stay here. Ah Fu. I want to return this to you. Ah Mei. Let me bring you to a place. I found some information. Hope it will help... ...answer your questions. "The old wires broke," "and ferry capsized in the rain." "17 students trapped in a bus and killed." It's them! It's them! What's wrong with them? My dad took me away that night. I was forced to leave. I was angry at him for not bringing me back. We were living a happy life here. Did your dad mention to you... ...about the shipwreck? Every time when he's drunk, he sees spirits of the kids come after him. I asked him why... ...but he would not tell. My dad is not a bad person. My dad will not harm others. Thank you. Ah Mei, can you really see ghosts? Can you do me a favor? This is my fiance. I wanted to see her. Just forget about it. Master, you must help me. You have not visited me for a while. Master, help me. There are things... ...that you can't control. I must protect my daughter. I cannot leave this place. Ah Chan cannot be homeless. I must protect her. In order to protect yourself... ...and harm others, this kind of sinful acts... ...will result in bad karma. I will bear the consequences. Ah Chan must stay safe. Master, help me. If you are seeking revenge, go after Ng Yu Mei. Look for Ng Yu Mei. Hi, Mr Zhao. Do you remember me? I said that I won't do the interview. I'm not here for interview. I'm asking for a favor. Do you remember the girl that day? Ah Mei. Ah Han is her dad. She wants to come back and stay here, but there are some misunderstanding with the villagers. They don't welcome her. Can you help her? Say a few words with the villagers? Sorry, I'm in a rush. Mr Zhao... You can find this person, maybe he can help you. Thank you. Are you Uncle Xiang? -Uncle Xiang. -Yes. Uncle Xiang, how are you? My name is Lim Yi Hui. I'm a reporter from Sin Pin Daily. Mr Zhao told me to look for you. I want to ask you about the shipwreck many years ago. Uncle Xiang, I heard that when the accident happens, you were at the riverside, right? Time flies, that was ten years ago. I still can't forget about it. That morning, I was already on the ferry. Then I remembered I left my things at home. So I got down... ...and walk home. Not long after I got down, I turned my head and look... The ferry was in the middle of the river, it sunk. Do you still remember... ...there were 17 students. Yes, it was because of this. Ah Han became the public enemy. I did help him explaining to everyone, but no one believed him. I know he felt guilty. All students in the bus, none were saved. Only the bus attendant was saved. The bus attendant? Every bus... ...has an assistant to help the driver. She was lucky... ...to survive through that tragedy. Do you know where she stays? How can we get in touch with her? She's working at a motel in town. Everybody knows her. They call her Sister Lan. Sister Lan? Ghost! Did you see that? A group of students in uniform. I didn't see anything. Only those sinful people... ...will see those spirits. Be careful. They are haunting you. Leave here soon. It's for your own good. Hi, Sister Lan. Sister Lan, can we talk? Sister Lan. I want to ask if you are the bus attendant... ...for the bus that Ah Mei's father was driving? Sister Lan, do you still remember the shipwreck accident many years ago? Sister Lan... Hi everyone. I hope everyone can calm down and listen to me. We all know that it was an accident. No one wish to see it happen, especially her dad. Are you saying she is not to be blamed? Please listen to me. There's a person who knows the whole story. It's Sister Lan, the bus attendant. I tried asking her to explain about the incident, but she would not do it. I hope the chairman can ask her to clarify the confusion. Mr Lim was right. Have a reasonable conversation. It's good for everyone. Since Ah Han's daughter is back, in our upcoming praying ceremony, bring your father here... ...and apologize to the victims. -Yes. -Her father is not here anymore. What do you mean? He passed away. Passed away? Then her daughter can do it on behalf of him and apologize. This has nothing to do with his daughter. It was an accident. Why are you giving her a hard time? Do you know that those children are innocent? Alright, stop arguing. Go back... Can you imagine how the victims' parents... ...are living their lives all these years? Some kept thinking of their kids... ...until they lose their minds. Some grandparents even before they die, they were still thinking of their grandchildren. One person's mistake... ...had caused such trauma to many families. Do you know that? We all know it's an accident. Accident? All of these happened because of her father! Why are you giving her a hard time? Why can't I give her a hard time? She got nothing to do with this. This has nothing to do with you either. Don't worry. I will find another opportunity to explain it to them. Come on. I'll walk you inside. Are you alright? You want to get rid of me? I won't leave... ...no matter what! I don't care who you are, I'm not going anywhere. You stay here by yourself? You can stay here. No one will bully you here. I bought you this. Look. You helped him before, and he repays your kindness now. This is what I said. Good deeds will always bring good karma. Everyone here... ...hates me. That's how the people behave. When accident happens, people will always look for a scapegoat to blame. It's alright. I hope Sister Lan can help you. I'll see you again. What's wrong? Sister Lan is a bad person. Why do you say that? I saw her visiting the shaman. The shaman knows how to make curses. Boss, excuse me. I'm a reporter from Sin Pin Daily. I want to ask you about the shipwreck accident many years ago. Do you have any photos regarding that? Photos? Let me have a look. Thank you. Thank you. Sister Lan. Sister Lan. Sister Lan. Where's Sister Lan? Ah Mei, what did you see? What happened? What did you say? Sister Lan caused... Sister Lan... Sister Lan caused... Go away! She said... Sister Lan killed us? What do you mean? Go away! Ah Mei! Go away! Ah Mei! Ah Mei, listen to me! Calm down! Let her go... It's alright. It's just an illusion... It's alright. Let her go! I said let her go. Let her go! All of you, let her go! Let... Let her go! Go away! All of you, go away! Haunting me for so many years... isn't that enough? I'm not afraid of you. You deserve it! I must not... I must not let others know the truth. Hurry up! Get in the car. Hurry up... Come. Get seated. Three of you at the back, stop playing. Faster, Sister Lan! Stop playing. Get seated. Old lady, why are you closing the door? Who are you calling old lady? Old lady. Behave yourself. You are so noisy. -One eyed freak. -Rascal! We have to get on the ferry. Close the door! Get seated! Hurry up! One eyed freak. Let me lock all of you up. So you can't open the door! Rascals! When you close the door just now, did you lock it? I didn't. Help me! Students! Save the students first! Save me! Help! Help me! My leg! Help! Students! I will not leave. Ah Chan will not leave too. God has punished me... one of my eyes is blind, a limping leg, a husband who passed away when I was young, and an autistic daughter, isn't that enough? Let me go! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Take me! Take me with you! Are you satisfied? Let her go! Take my life. Let her go! Take my life. Let her go! Ah Mei... I sacrifice my life for you. You must... ...take care of Ah Chan for me. Mom. Ah Mei, are you alright? It's alright. Ah Mei, do you remember... ...why you came back in the first place? You want a happy family. Before this, everything was going well. Why did it end up like this? Why don't you believe in ghost? Don't you... ...want to see your loved one? If you don't believe in ghost, you won't get to see them. When people die, there's nothing left. Even if there is, it's just the past. We should let go of the past. You should not live under Sister Lan's shadow anymore. Alright? It's not your fault. It's not your father's fault too. You need to understand, even if the backdoor was not locked, the accident was not something your father can prevent. I can't give you 17 kids. I can't let them die for me. You caused their death, but I don't blame you. I hope you don't blame me... ...for not taking good care of Ah Chan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The praying ceremony... ...ha been conducted for decades. I want to ask you, why would you come back? Don't you afraid of ghost? Although this place has changed a lot, but the folks here are still the same. Keep talking about the same myths. That's right. It has been so many years. Everyone still can't get over... ...the shipwreck accident many years ago, and the rumors from time to time. Maybe it's their way of remembering the deceased. How about you? Have you seen a ghost before? No, how about you? No but I believe in ghosts. It's just that... ...those with fears in their heart will see them. Only writers can come up with words like that. Have you seen Ah Mei when you are back? Now, only Ah Mei can help herself. In the past, when I heard of people talk about ghost, I would be annoyed. Now I understand that... everything happens for a reason. Her health has improved a lot, and she looks cheerful than before. Do you have better sleep recently? Remember to keep a positive mood. Relax and be optimistic. Many problems are not as complicated as we think it is. It's just that if we worry too much, it will become a burden for us.
