[Mysterious music] * [Growl] [Splashing] [Ominous music] * [Cocks gun] * [Thrashing] [Roars] [Squishing] [Growling] [Dramatic music] * * How'd we do today, Judith? Well, let's see. [Beeping] They've grown 22 inches since our last reading, And that was... [Beeping] That was this morning, doctor. Imagine a technology that can rapidly regrow damaged organs... A technology capable of bringing a cow like Jersey here To full maturity within weeks instead of years. That means... More dairy product... [Whispers] And beef. All of this and more is possible With a promise a.G.T.: Accelerated growth technology. Welcome to the future. Welcome to gereco. Expect big things. Uh, I'll check the scanner on the way out. Continue to record their progress hourly. It's very important. Good night, Judith. Good night. [Dramatic music] * [Growling and screeching] Oh... Shit. Stop it! Stop it! [Muted growl] [Rapid beeping] [Moaning] [Ominous music] * [Rattling] [Electricity buzzes] [Roaring and screaming] [Distant roaring] Dr. Campbell? Judith? Is everything all right in here? [Roaring] [Buzzing] No... [Roaring] [Dramatic music] * Hmm. This is the test animal in question. As you can see, it's clearly dead. This is the animal that killed the girl? Yes. This was a freak laboratory accident. Nothing more. Okay, I'll put that in the report. If there are any further inquiries, Mr. Mayfield will be glad to assist you, sheriff. Deputy. Hmm. Mr. Mayfield. Do the police want to talk to me now? Remember, you didn't see anything. But I did, miss Kennedy. I saw it running down the hall. We don't need to open our private company To public scrutiny. You didn't see anything. Understand? What about the one that escaped? [Thumping footsteps] You said yourself, these specimens Have a limited lifespan. Oh, we don't know that for sure. There's been progress with each successive test. There's no reason not to expect this one to reach full maturity. [Stomping] I've got some calls to make. Hi. Hey. Lost your dog, huh? His name is lucky. How long has lucky been missing? Since yesterday. I thought he would come back, but he didn't. May I have one? Sure. He's only got three legs. Yeah, I can see that. Are you Michael? Mm-hmm. Tom banning. Is that your father? No, he's my brother. My dad died. So have you seen lucky? Uh, I'll certainly look for him, okay? Okay, thanks, lady. Bye! Larry? I'm here, Diane. Just need you to pull an adoption record. Sure. Is something wrong? I just ran into a kid whose dog I gave away this morning. The three-legged mix. Okay, I got the number. [Buttons beeping] [Line ringing] The number you have reached is not in service at this time, And there is no new number. That bastard. Payday already? We have an animal loose on the preserve that needs to be fed. It's critical you feed it At the same time and place every night. We've got to keep it coming back until it can be recaptured. I could trap this thing for ya. My brother and me, Hank, used to trap muskrats all the time. We're bringing in a trained specialist. Miss p., I could do this. Mr. danders, your job is to feed it. Just do your job. I'll leave you with the good doctor to discuss details. But, miss p., I can do this. So, doc, what kind of animal are we looking for, anyway? All right, little dog, you just wait right here. [Chuckles] Ah, mutt. [Mumbling indistinctly] [Dog whimpering and panting] [Saw buzzing] Michael, tell me you're not out riding your bike this late. Well, I've been looking for lucky, And it isn't that late. I mean, it's only 11:00. 11:00 is late. You still haven't found him? I put up all these flyers for lucky, And I've been looking really, really hard. Do me a big, big favor. I really got to finish this work, Mikey, So go inside and eat something and get ready for bed. And, look, if he doesn't come back by tomorrow, I'll help you find him. I promise. Okay? Okay. [Saw buzzing] Come here, dog. Come on. Come on. [Chuckling] Come on, dog. Come on. Fingers, you dog. Come on. [Whimpering] [Crunching] Lay down. You ain't gettin' away. No, you ain't. [Barking] Hey, dog. Come back here, you mutt! [Thrashing] [Suspenseful music] * [Splashing and growling] [Dogs barking] It's okay, babe. It's okay. Hey, you wanted to see me? Yes, sir. A man came in yesterday and took a dog. He gave me a false name and contact number. Here. This is the dog. So? Well, he lied. Actually, he did you a favor. You got to start getting rid of some of these animals. I'm working on it. Diane... Are you having trouble putting these dogs down? I'm sorry. I just can't gas an innocent animal. I know that, but it's costing the taxpayers a hell of a lot... You know, if the taxpayers Would spay and neuter their pets, We wouldn't have this problem. Mm. Look, I'm having a special July 4th adoption day. You and mom don't have a dog. You know how your mom feels about fleas. I'll see you later, tiger. Take care of business, okay? Mm, I'm not gonna let him get you. [Saw buzzing] [Knocks] Does your dad know you're here? Nope. How's your jaw? Healed eventually. So... How have you been? Okay. You? I ran into Michael the other day Looking for his dog. Lucky. Yeah. I just wanted to let him know I wasn't giving up hope, That I was still looking. Diane, are you there? Will you excuse me? Diane? Diane, pick up, please. Yeah, Larry? Someone reported seeing your missing dog. Said he was running around over at the gereco preserve, Like the devil was after him. Are you sure it was him? You're kidding, right? Right, Larry, thanks. 10-4. If it has to do with Michael's dog, I should be involved. Five minutes to get my act together. Edwin! Edwin! Larry said he was seen somewhere around here. What's going through that head of yours? Nothin'. Just thinking. About what? How you've grown up. Yeah? So what happened to you? [Laughs] Oh... Lucky! There he is. Lucky! [Whistles] [Suspenseful music] * Edwin? [Cocks gun] Sign says "no trespassing." It's just for civilians. So, what, I wait here? You're with me. Hey, there he is! Lucky! Come here, lucky. He might not come. He's afraid of me. I-I dropped an anvil on his foot when he was a puppy. It was an accident. That's horrible! All right, you're forgiven. Come on. [Suspenseful music] * [Goose honks] * [Flies buzzing] [Both panting] [Laughing] This is ridiculous. Okay, look, more tracks. It looks like he went that way. Well, what are you waiting for? [Splashes] [Dramatic music] * [Barking] Yeah. What was that? I think maybe we got him. Come here, you little... [Growls] [Laughing] Ah, you got to be kidding me. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's funny, huh? Go on, laugh. * Come on. Help me out of here, will ya? Come on. Oh! [Screams] [Beeping] [Growling] Oh, this is so gross! Oh, my God. [Growling] [Giggling] [Beeping] Out! Get... Out of the water! Get... [Laughing] [Distant yelling] Go! Get out! Go! Hey, is he talking to us? Move away! What's he doing? - Come on, get out of the water. - Let's go. Let's go! Oh, my God, he's got a gun! What? Come on! Where should we go? [Gunshot] [Gunshot] Where are ya? Hide! Get down. Get down. Get down! Get down! You stay here. - What? - Just stay here. Take him out. What? I'm gonna take him out. Stay. Careful. [Grumbling] [Blow lands] [Moans] He's waking up. We should take him to the sheriff's station. No, he needs a doctor. No. No doctors. No sheriff. Please. I have a reason for what I did. Well, start talking. My name is Dr. Lance Campbell. I'm sorry if I frightened you. If you'd be kind enough to drive me to gereco, I'll explain everything. Please. The facility has restricted access, so... Give me a few minutes to clean up. Genetic research corporation, better known as gereco, Is a multifaceted company That utilizes genetic technology to enhance everyday living. Look, cut the sales pitch. Why did you attack us? I didn't. I was protecting you. Oh, okay, from what? A rather large chimaera crocodilian. So you have crocodiles? Uh, just one. It escaped as a hatchling, and it's grown remarkably fast. And this crocodile lives on the preserve? Yes, but for how long, I can't say. So far, none of our test subjects Have survived very long. I assure you, the preserve is well-secured. Still my jurisdiction, doctor. Gereco leases the preserve from the county. [Cell phone rings] Uh, excuse me a moment. [Ringing continues] I don't trust him. Yes. Why did you bring them here? There's been another incident. Edwin danders was killed. By the experiment? Yes. Dr. Campbell, listen carefully. Gereco will not be held responsible For the indiscretion of a rogue scientist. Rogue scientist? It was developed by... Our help has arrived. I suggest you remedy the situation at once. Well, good news. A wildlife expert has arrived from Australia To take care of the problem. So we won't be needing your help after all. Wasn't offering my assistance, doctor. This is my responsibility. We go along, whether you like it or not. Now, where are we meeting?

Y'all coming? * Thank you. More than welcome. So, uh, what does Diane do? Diane is the regional animal control officer. Ah. Glorified dogcatcher, really. Hmm. What do you do, dick? I'm a snake charmer. Dick is a herpetologist. Reptile expert. I handle personal wildlife, Anything from deadly snakes to rampaging wild boars. But my favorite animal to kill is the croc. The bigger, the better. You know what I mean? So what's your plan? Well, that's easy. We just scope out the feeding area, Catch it, cage it, and kill it. How big is it? I can't say for sure. That means we have to get a lay of the land. Ever hunt a croc before? I don't hunt. We all do, sweetheart. It's our nature. [Laughing] I still don't know why You're wearing desert fatigues in the woods. 'Cause we're going hunting, you idiot. Well, they don't allow no hunters in here, Carl. You know why? Why is that? 'Cause there's deer everywhere, man. And you know what that means? What? This is like fishing in a bowel, brother. [Laughter] Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yee-haw! How come we ain't seen one deer? We ain't seen a squirrel or a possum. We ain't seen a groundhog. We ain't seen any fishes. Enough already! I'm gonna go take a leak. You keep your eyes open. This is stupid. Idiot.

[Both yelling indistinctly] Swim to the boat! [Both yelling indistinctly] Come on! Come on! [Yelling] Dr. Campbell, swim! Dr. Campbell! No! No! Diane! He's gone. He's gone. [Bulbs flashing] [All yelling indistinctly] Miss Kennedy! Miss Kennedy! Miss Kennedy, what does... What does gereco have to do With the deaths on grant's lake today? Nothing, that I'm aware of. The reason I invited you here is to make it clear that, Despite the viscous rumors, Gereco has no knowledge or involvement In any of the tragic events that occurred today. Miss Kennedy! Miss Kennedy! Miss Kennedy! One of your employees was killed, And there are eyewitnesses... Dr. Campbell... Dr. Campbell technically was not an employee of gereco. He was an independent contractor. But hasn't he been using gereco facilities? I'll turn this over to sheriff Harper. [All yelling indistinctly] Sheriff Harper, There have been rumors of a large lizard in the lake. What is your response? We're investigating the accidents on the lake. Until further notice, All activities are suspended. The park is closed. Sheriff Harper! Thank you. Thank you very much. Sheriff Harper, could you please comment? They haven't told us anything. Miss Kennedy. Last week, a baby crocodile Killed a girl in your laboratory. Now I've got a giant lizard killing people in my lake. What's the, uh, gereco connection here? None, that I'm aware. That's bullshit, and you know it. [Elevator dings] We're done, sheriff. If you have anymore questions, I suggest you take it up with our legal department. [Groans] How long is he gonna be like that? Uh, I don't know. A couple hours maybe. It's a strong tranquilizer. Yeah. So this is his flat, huh? Yeah, he's an artist. An artist? [Chuckles] That explains everything. Well, I happen to like him a lot. He makes all this stuff? It's called "sculpture." Sculpture? Well, it looks to me like you and I Are never gonna sing with the kookaburras, are we? Whatever that is, no, I don't think so. Well, you can't have everything, can you, sweetheart? How about a ride to the bar? Actually, my father would like to have a word with us. She's in love with the artist. So what are we talking about here? A giant crocodile. I've seen everything, but I've never seen anything like this. This is no ordinary croc. Gereco. Yeah, gereco. Hey, boyne. Take out a warrant on gereco, And make sure you include miss Kennedy. Gotcha. Broke my best knife on her. She's made of steel. So how do we kill this thing? Gas it. Carbon monoxide. Exterior vertebrates are very susceptible to carbon monoxide. She might have a point. That's how we used to put sea crocs out of their misery Back home. Okay, so how do we find this thing here, though? Well, this is where she lives. She might feed elsewhere, but she'll be back. We should wait here till morning time. No, tonight. We're gonna kill this thing tonight. Kill it with what? Diane, I'm gonna get us all the firepower we've got. We've got to get rid of this thing tonight Before it kills somebody else. Dad, if anybody's gonna get killed, it's gonna... Diane, please! Sheriff, maybe we should wait. We should be patient. Hey, look, dick, I'm running the show here, okay? Kerrigan. Yes, sir. No drama. Have it your way, sheriff. You know where to find me. Get the croc doc out of here, will ya? Let's go, desperado. Okay, men, let's move. Spread out. Let's go. Ah! Ah. [Solemn music] * [Engine rumbling] [Suspenseful music] * Sheriff? Sheriff, I think I got something here. Guys, I got something. What is it? It's a kid's bicycle, what's left of it. Damn. Oh, no. [Retches] Hey. [Ominous music] * It's the boy. How am I gonna tell tom? Tell me what? What is this? Don't. You don't want to see this. Hey. Hey, hey! Oh... [Solemn music] * Tom... [Engine turns over] I'm sorry, honey. I can't let you go. It's too dangerous. I'm part of this. Diane, please listen, honey. If something happens to you, I'd never forgive myself. You can imagine what your mother would do to me. Be careful. All right, come here. I want you to stay together. Stay in radio contact. I'm gonna try to lure him to the South shore. If you get a shot, take it. Don't wait for my orders. Let's move. [Guns cock] Hey, um... Let me have a shot glass and a bottle of anything, And leave it right here, huh? And we've had such an exciting game Up here the bottom of the 4th inning, and it's heating up. And, you know, at the end of this ball game, It's playoff time, And only one of these teams is gonna move on. So, I got to tell ya, To be in this booth and to see the energy of the field, It's just unbelievable. Excuse me. You look like you've seen a ghost, mate. [Scoffs] It got my brother. My 12-year-old brother. I know how you feel, mate. Hey, you don't... You don't know how I feel. One of those bastards killed my son a few years back. Well, then, I'm sorry for you.

We're gonna need Tommy too. I don't think it's a good time. I'll help. Let's kill the fucker. Right on. [Dramatic music] * [Zapping] * [Zapping] How's it going? It's all set, boss. How we gonna lure the croc into the tunnel? There's no worries about that. We've got the bait coming in now. What bait? [Dogs barking] Oh, no, you don't. "No, you don't" what? He thinks he's gonna use the dogs. Dad, please don't use the dogs. Honey, I have to. Well, I won't allow it. As animal control, I'm in charge, And I say no. Well, then, you've just been fired. What? You can't do that. Yes, I can. I just did. Look, Diane, it's not your decision. It's mine. Well, I won't let you! Diane, please don't do this. No, you don't do this! I'll get in the way. Kerrigan. Cuff her. - What? - Are you sure, boss? Do it. Hey, no, you stay off of her. Cuff him too. What? You can't arrest me. Who said anything about arresting you? I'm detaining you. There's a difference.

Spotting unit? You mean spotlight. Yeah, mate. Okay, turn off the spotlight. It would really help matters if you would, uh, Learn to speak English, you know. Too right, boss. Too right. Grab the torch. Grab the flint strike right there. All right, now, the knob at the red hose, Turn that counterclockwise Till you hear gas coming out of the nozzle. Okay, now hold the flint strike at the nozzle. Get the flame... Going. All right, now, this knob right there, Turn that slowly. All right, good. Now, you gonna aim for the middle link, all right?

[Engine turns over] [Intense music] * You're crazy. [Roaring] [Engine revving] [Roaring] [Screeching] You think it'll work? [Roaring and pounding] [Pounding] [Defeated screech] First he breaks my jaw, then your dad has me handcuffed. I love that guy. What's this? Who's that? She's the one that hired me. Where's the animal? Over here. Come on. Make sure you use the soft light. I'm sorry, sir. She heard the activity over the radio. It's okay. What do you want? Well, the public needs to know that the danger is over. Is it? I don't hear anything. Well, then, open it up. I've got to do this quickly. I've got an injured man. We'll talk later. Let's go. - Open it. - Yes, ma'am. Let's get this moving. Not that I could do anything about it now, but... It's okay if you see my daughter. Thanks, dad. Take care of her. Thank you, sir. So, uh, when are you heading back to Australia? After I see a couple of sights. You're a lucky man. How did gereco get involved in all this? As soon as we heard that there was a problem, We contacted sheriff Harper and his men. We made every resource available we had, Including our subcontractor Dr. Campbell, Who, unfortunately, Had a terrible accident on the lake. Was there a plan? No. But we came up with one. After the tragic loss of life, we decided to step in and... She's making things up. That's the way of the world. Let's go, dick. See ya later. Maybe we should turn the gas back on. [Engine turns over] Thank you for being there. I'll always be there, If you like. [Romantic music] * And if it weren't for the efforts of gereco, We may not have seen the end of this incident For days or even weeks.
