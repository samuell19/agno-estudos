Didn't know my own strength. That was odd. What happened? What is it? It's very quiet, sir. Last subject was...? What's this Lloyd? 2300. Yes sir. Couldn't you, couldn't you be neater? It's the ballpoint, sir. It was the car ferry to Tucay. Should be back any minute. They run all night from now to September. You know, Lloyd, if the Russians start to invade, you'll be sitting here watching that radar and telling me it's the car ferry 20 minutes early. Yes, sir. Here she comes now, sir. Back to the mortgage. The eight four to town and the flowers, and the greenhouse. That's a bit odd. What is? Well she's off beam, sir. Look, can you see it? No, that's much too small for a plane. Call control. Alpha Bravo, calling control. Alpha Bravo, calling control. I can't get them here, sir. Coming this way, look. 8000. That's ridiculous. What do you think, sir? What do you think we should do? Much too small for a plane. Less than 5000 now. It could be a fuel tank. It happened in Alaska last year. Off a car ferry. This thing is flying not falling. The Russians haven't sent anything up recently, have they? No, not at all. And the Americans not until the... That was odd. The battery doesn't suddenly cut out like that. I'm glad we didn't get stranded on a night like this. Is he dead? Is he? No, he's still alive. Funny clothes. - Is it a fancy dress? - No. Look, let's go. Can't we leave him? He looks alright to me. Let's go before we get mixed up in anything. He might die. No, someone else will find him. Shut up. Just shut up. Doesn't smell like fog, does it? We must get him to hospital. Oh god, god, god, god, what am I going to do? I'll drop you at the house. Can you drive? You know I can't. - Where are you going? - To fetch the car. It may come out, they may say you were drunk. Don't give them my name, will you? I don't want to get involved. You know... you're the one who was always scared that your wife would find out about us. Shut up and get in the car. No, no I'm not going into any dorsal. I need treatment, treatment. You think I'm just an old, there is something wrong with me nurse. I was blinded by those lights, blinded by those lights. ...doesn't know anything. Nurse, I'm not going into any hostel. He doesn't know what he's doing. If he did I would be admitted. If he did I would be admitted. My car is in for servicing. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here at all. You just think I'm an old malingerer. No, no, I've got money in the bank. They're all trying to kill me, oh god. Blast, there's no going into this room. Wait in here. I'll be back as soon as I can. Surgical spirit. - What? - The bottle. No, gin. - Must be the manitys. - Don't let me see him again. - Joe. - 13 times in the last 10 weeks. Everything from Beri Beri to the Black Death. What was it this time? The best of the lot. Temporary blindness from seeing unnatural lights in the sky. Yes, that's a better one. Well next time it's the police. RTA sir, there's a child.. Doctor, quickly. I've left him in the car, I knocked him over. One minute the road was clear then suddenly there he was. He didn't move. He jumped out in front... he's in the car. You've been a patient here yourself, haven't you? I have a thrombosis, Mr Carter. Carotid pulse, but very faint. I couldn't help it doctor, he jumped out - in front of the car. - Ted, get him in and get that fancy dress off him. - Right sir. He must have jumped straight out, I didn't even see him. Were you alone? Yes. I'd call the police if I were you sir. Can I ring from inside? Yes of course. Nurse, I want to take some blood for cross matching. Never seen clothes like these before? Kind of rubber. Any papers? Driving licence or anything like that. No, not even a label of any sort. Well his condition is more important than his identity. Hello. Oh, hello didn't know you were on duty. You just caught me as I was leaving. What have you got there? RTA, wandering around in a fancy dress. Chinese I think. No, he's not Chinese. How do you know? Well... is he nurse? No, I don't think so. Japanese? Nope. Doesn't matter, we'll worry about his nationality later. Apian natural? Yes, he may have a fractured skull. Any localising signs? Can't find any. Well leave him to me, I'll let you know as soon as they're ready. Ted, Harry, X-rays. When they finish bring them back. You may also find some fans we may need to cool him. I'm taking it to the lab. It's all right Sister's with him. Keep an eye on his pulse and respirations, if there's any change, call me. All right. Hello residence. Oh dear. Hello Dr Harland. This is Dr Vernon. What do you want? Sorry to disturb your beauty sleep but I need two pints cross matched. - Now. - Yes now, the patient's unconscious. Could be internal or cerebral injuries. Oh, all right. Now are you really awake or shall I call you back. I'm awake. By the way, I thought you were giving them up. Do you mind? Oh dear. Oh, well. Two pints of blood cross matching coming up. So you'd been to a party, sir? That's correct, Sergeant. Good party? Reasonable. - With some friends? - Naturally. Some old army friends. Reunion party, was it? Just a party. And you had quite a lot to drink? I was not drunk. That wasn't my question sir. Still, I don't know what these reunion parties are like. Let's just stick to the facts, shall we? Then we can go home and get some sleep. Earlier on you were saying something about fogs. There were patches of it on the road. - We drove through one or two... - We? I thought you said you were alone, sir? I meant I. I see. Carry on. I drove through this patch of... Was this before or after the electrical failures? Before. As I said, I drove through this fog then the engine cut out... sort of picked up again. Then more fog and then this man suddenly stepped out. And you braked? Yes, of course I braked. Marks on the road? I suppose so. I couldn't miss him... tipped him over on to the verge. There's only one thing that puzzles me. We haven't had any fog here tonight. Sister, is nothing ever hot in this hospital. I'll try to think of a witty reply. His pulse is going up so I thought we'd better bring him back. - X-rays? - They're being developed. Well, we may have to cool him. Come on. Sorry to bother you, Sister. That's all right, Sergeant. What are his challenges? Why? Identification. Where do you start with this one. Can't we give him blood transfusion? God, some people in this hospital - have got pretty feeble minds. - What? If this is your idea of a joke, Doctor Vernon - then I'm sorry... - What are you talking about? Don't you think I've got enough to do... - Okay calm down... - ...without you getting me up in the middle of the night - for this rubbish. - ...and tell me what's the matter. You know, damn well. I haven't heard yet what it is I'm supposed to have done. The blood, dear. What's wrong with it? Don't be so ridiculous. I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I collected it myself - and I gave it to... - I took it straight to the lab. Now you're asleep. - Are you sure? - Look do you want - a sample of this? - You're asleep, are you sure - you didn't make a mistake? - Do you want a sample? What do you know about him? Nothing. Is he an ambulance job? No, he was brought in by a Mr Blackburn. Do you to remember him? - He had a coronary... - Oh yes. I did it at... Well according to Blackburn he virtually stepped on to the wheels of the car. Well, you better examine this with me. What about hypothermia? Can't do any harm? Yeah, what else can you do? I don't understand. Will the second lot of blood look normal too? What are you doing? I'm just reminding myself what normal blood looks like. It's month since I looked down one of these things. Well here you are, try this for size. I don't believe it. Well, it seems I owe you... Doctor, I'm sorry too. But it's absurd. Well, there it is. Whatever he is, wandering around the road in the middle of a night in a rubber suit, what does it mean? Perhaps it's some rare form of sickle cell disease. The American and the Russian astronauts... Oh no, no. No human being ever had blood, the remotely matched that. Well maybe a prolonged period out of space - because see the... - No. Yes. Yes, Miss Guff. All right, we'll be right down. She wants us to see the X-rays immediately. Why? She wouldn't say. Any sign of the fracture? No, none at all. There's a radio opaque disc inside his brain. - Inside the...? - Inside. That confirms it. Confirms what? He's not human. Look at the size of it. Look at the position. Yes, I see what you mean. What's the position gotta do... It's in on the Broca's area. Well it's a specially developed part of the premotor cortex, it controls language and lingual movements. Another name for it is the motor speech area. So if you wanna put something inside the brain to control speech that's where you put it. It looks like metal. Could it be some sort of communication device? Whoever he is and wherever he came from he came prepared. He treated me like a criminal. You didn't tell him about me? More or less accused me to my face. What did I say you might have... The he had the gall to say they hadn't been any fog. Well, I told you it smelt odd. What did? The fog. How do you mean? I don't know, it just didn't smell right that's all. How are you gonna get back to town? Charming. I can't drive you there, the police might call any minute. God, what a night. You won't lose out, I'll see you that. So will I. Night of bliss this this turned out to be. I don't know. Somebody moving about outside. You see, contrary to normal, the more he's cooled the more his blood pressure goes up. And his respiration improves. Dr Vernon. What's the panic Vernon, why did your phone? It's a casualty, sir. We... Take a deep breath. We admitted him just after... I'm not an expectant father, Vernon. No, sir. Well, he's not. He's not human. Not human? That's what I said, sir. Well, then what is it? I don't know. Are you drunk'? No, of course I'm not... The blood is definitely not human. It doesn't begin to match our... And not only that but he has a large metal disc inside his brain. What is it Sister? He grabbed me doctor, I didn't know he was conscious. Well he looks perfectly human to me. Yes he does, doesn't he? Who are you? I didn't mean to frighten her, I'm sorry. I had to touch her before I could speak. Touch her before you could... Direct electronic pathway through my hand to my brain. It enables me to speak to anyone, - Presumably that would... - That accounts for the disc. Who are you? Where'd you come from? I'm from the planet Lystria. Were you here Sister when he was admitted? Oh, yes, sir. He was brought in by car. Thank you for your help. Sister, would you turn these things off please. Why have you come here? We were on our way to... another planet. Our ship broke down, two prisoners escaped. I was looking for them. Prisoners? We re-captured them. My uniform, what have you done with it? It's over here. Can I have it? Something is missing. A power pack on a belt shaped like a cylinder. It may have fallen off in the car. - Car? - Yes. Yes. That's all right then. - Are you in pain? - Tired. So, perhaps when you've rested a little we could have a talk. Obviously there are lots of questions we'd like to ask you. Certainly if you wish. I'd like to make some notes. Sister would you get his case paper please? - Yes. - Thank you. - You tell her what to do? - Yes. Interesting. And she obeys you. Why not? Good, I approve. What you and Vernon see, but to accept it though, it makes me suspicious. We've had longer to adjust to the idea. Obviously it isn't one we can decide ourselves, we'd better call the other Consultants in. I'll call Mr Dawson. No, on second thoughts let's let's keep this to ourselves just for the time being. As you wish. Is that blood sample still up in the lab? I'd I better take a look at it... and the X-ray plates. Imagine by lunchtime tomorrow we could have every newspaper in the world down here. If he's still here. Why shouldn't he be? Why should he? We've got to keep him here. Perhaps I'll have to take some pictures just in case. Those blood samples are enough for me. I want this fully documented. Can you imagine what it would be worth? He's not only a creature from outer space but a man, a human being. You have to get him to cooperate. I don't see how that's going to be a problem, he seemed quite grateful for all we've done. Electronic pathway to the brain. Let me take a look at that X-ray. They could be years ahead of us. They still have prisoners. - Hey you. - Huh? What are you doing? What are you up to? We're looking for rockets and spacemen. Whose idea is this? The Major's. I'd like a few words with him, You asked for it. Sir. Come on lads, cut out the talking. Let's get on with the job, eh. Yes Jones. Morgan, sir. Well, same thing, isn't it? Sergeant Draker of the local constabulary. Constabulary, he's a police officer, isn't he? Yes, sir. Well say so. Now Good evening Sergeant. What are you up to here? Well that's a very interesting question. See this. Come and have a look. What do you make of this? - Looks like fin marks. - Yes. Well, that's what they are. Well what from? I don't know. But, whatever it was it was certainly some size. Where's it gone? Wish I knew. We just heard the roar of its engines. I see. We picked up something else earlier on, on the radar, but, nothing the size of this of course. Why didn't you pick up this? Well, we just didn't. Jones. Morgan sir. - Yes. - Oh, yes. You know what this is? Yes, it registers radio activity, doesn't it? Yep. Now I'll stand about here, now listen. Satisfied? Mystified. Well, we we think that a rocket touched-down here and hull rested here. It was atomic powered and that's why we're picking up the radioactivity now. But we've still no idea what the other thing was we tracked earlier on the radar. - Sir, sir. - Yes. We found something sir. Right. Come on, Sergeant, drive up! Stand by. Looks like a... space capsule. I reckon this I what we tracked on the radar. Those marks we saw came from a spaceship, this must be one of the pups. I reckon this is a Russian job. The Americans aren't launching anything 'till next month. There was a foreign looking bloke involved in an accident earlier tonight. Knocked down by a travelling car. What time was it? One o'clock. That was just after we spotted this thing, wasn't it? He could be the pilot. Man in the car said that there'd been some fog. I checked, there wasn't any. I'll report this thing from the local hospital. I think I'll go down and have a word with this chap. He was unconscious when I left. Sister didn't rate his chances very highly. Well it's worth a try, isn't it? Otherwise Sergeant you're wrong about the fog. When we got to the field where the fin marks were it was covered in it. - Sergeant Williams. - Sir. Take care of it till I get back and don't let anyone. It's all right I'll dive. Don't let anyone near that... Very good sir. - Where will you be? - Local hospital. I'm placing him under arrest. Charlie, how can you arrest... well we don't even know what he is. Exactly. Well, he's not an enemy or an invader. How do you know? I talked to him. What I see tonight ensures that we should take the strictest security precautions. While he's in this hospital he's my responsibility and I say we treat him like any other patient. All right, I'll phone for authority. It doesn't make any difference to me. This is a hospital not a regimental barracks. Hello switch board. Give me GHQ Sergeant Commander. When was that? I see. All the outside lines are out of order. The outside lines are out of order. All of them. Yes, apparently we're cut off. Hello, it's Mr Carter here. What's this about the phone being cut off? When? 20 minutes ago. Let me know when it's back to normal, will you? You still think there's no danger? Yes. All right, keep trying. No good. Is it... my imagination or is it getting hotter? It's always warm in casualty. Not this warm. It's off, sir. Perhaps the central heating gone wrong, it's happened before. - Possibly. - ...like a furnace. There's no good opening the windows either, it's just as hot outside and going up. Yes, we've noticed. Well, I think this has something to do with your patient. How could it? Well remember, we're dealing with people who are very much in advance of us, scientifically, and I think maybe... maybe there's... some sort of force field has been laid over the hospital. Yes, yes, it's possible. What is a force field? Well, let's say that force and energy equals heat, I don't know. What would be the point of it? Well, the Lystrian said he was after two prisoners, perhaps it's to prevent them escaping. Or to prevent us from capturing all three of them. If they're so far in advance of us they can't... They might not realise that themselves. This force field could it affect the phone? Possibly, certainly would account for the increase in temperature because the radiant heat's no longer being dissipated. Yes, well who is responsible for it though? Him, a spaceship, a rocket, who knows? - Well that fits. - Why? Well out on the field we saw these marks, fin marks, as if they'd come off a giant rocket. I think I better go and talk to him. - All right. - No, no. Vernon, William, start some fire precautions, don't let anyone panic. Phone is to be used only in emergency. Yes, we'll cut all the electricity we can. Nurse, don't run... oxygen's precious, if you hurry you'll tire yourself unnecessarily. Where are you going? Sister send me to change. I'm wearing a nylon slip... it's producing static. Fine, but walk. Who are you? Thank you. Now you're going to sleep. He's a bit bit long winded, isn't he? He ought to be in my regiment, I've got one or two who'll go well with him. You all right? Fine. But if it gets any hotter we'll be in trouble. How do you mean? Let's wait and see if Carter gets anywhere. You don't sound very optimistic. I'm not. Well, sir. We've reached an agreement. I've promised to communicate with the civil authorities. - On whose behalf? - The hospital's. What does he do in return? He'll see that the hospital comes to no harm... If he can do it. Dr Harland, this man is the leader of an advanced civilisation, from any point of view we'd be mad if... - Yes but what if he's lying. - Yes, well that what I mean. - Why on earth should he lie? - Well doctor... we'll have to assume he can do all these things... what if he can't? What is this force field? There's nothing... It certainly has nothing to do with a hospital. Doctor, I've seen those fin marks... that was one hell of a mark for just one man. He said he was after two prisoners, remember? All right, what if they were after him and where are they? Sir, who is it you're going to see? That's my business. When I suggest. Look, we haven't got much time, when you get to a phone call... - There's plenty of time. - Call the army, call... My friend's an MP. If I leave now I can catch him before breakfast. But by tomorrow we might all be dead. We must tell the authorities now. Can't you see I'm doing this for the hospital if we handle this properly... But supposing he isn't their leader. That he is, I know. How do you know? He told me, I have his word. Suppose he's lying. You believed him a few hours ago, why the change of heart? Because 300 patients lives are more important than any glory we may get... out of it. What did he hit? Nothing. You mean we can't get out? Look at the car. So much patient's promises. Can you tow it away? Yeah. If no one can get in or out of the hospital... Imagine what damage a fire would do? How'd you keep so cool? Get some tea, will you? Nurse, will you get some tea? I'll get tea. Yes, Sister. - Will you talk to him? - Why? Well, you might get more out of him than I can. Why should I? Well he seems... he seems scared women. Well not scared exactly, more. Well, he was surprised when I was ordering Sister around. Okay, well it's worth a try. Mr Carter was killed a few minutes ago. Killed, how? His car ran into an invisible wall. That's murder in any kind of civilisation. I had nothing to do with it. The hospital's cut off, - are you responsible for this? - No. Then who is? You can't get away can you? One man chasing two prisoners? They're after you, aren't they? You're the prisoner. Yes. Why are they after you? They say I committed murder. - And did you? - No. Our justice is a poor thing often conducted by women. I had no trial, I was on my way to prison. A penal settlement on another planet. The spaceship failed. While it was been repaired, - I got away. - How? In a communication capsule, it's hidden not far from here. The force field, this heat, is created by your guards. They can't find me. Well, why not? Because your friends lost a power pack from my tunic, that was the only way they have of tracking me. When I've rested, I'll leave. Where will you go? Some other part of your Earth, somewhere warmer. How many more people will be killed before that happens? Well done. Why, what did I do? Now we've got one chance, to get hold of that cylinder, the power pack, and then his guards come here and pick him up. I know it's a risk but at least we can reason with them. Maybe they're... not as savage as he says. Come on sit down. Anyway, our first duty is to the hospital. Well you can't get out, can you? I've got to. Oh, god. Our chest patients won't be able to breathe. There's a hidden point in the iron lung - if the electricity fails. - I know that. We're just gonna sit here and boil to death? Or what, commit suicide like Carter? Did you hear what he said about - going somewhere warmer? - Yes. Thanks. That's better... it's warm. I think this heat enables him to move around in more comfort. And without their spacesuits. Look. At what? If water can get in, I can get out. The plans, the plans of the building. I've seen them here somewhere. That cylinder thing, where is it? In Blackburn's car, or... or the accident or somewhere in between. But, that could take you hours. It could but it's better than sitting around here on our backsides doing nothing. Now let's get a torch and I'll show you. Okay... Sister, don't let him out of your sight. Very good doctor. Put on your most ferocious expression and keep it pointing at him. Have I got one? And, don't leave him for a minute. Stay with him all the time. How long to find Blackburn's address? About a minute. Right meet you by the fire escape. March and it's like mid summer. Well what are you gonna do? Well listen, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna try something. Going anywhere near London. Covent Garden, do you? Marvellous. Hop in. What are you doing running around the countryside in the middle of the night. I've been to a party, only it wasn't the sort of party I thought it was going to be. You know the transport caff a couple of miles back. No... It's just like a casualty clearing station. You know, the old butcher shop. There was some sort of blackout and then a pileup on the motorway. - Oh yeah. - Terrible when you think of it. - Would you like a cigarette? - Ta. It's all right nurse. Would you like me to take over? No thanks. You go and get some rest? Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Yes. Why is it so hot? There's a fault in the central heating... nothing to worry about. You're off you're rounds aren't you? Just helping out. What's going on? Nothing. They don't tell you a darn thing in hospital, do they? You'll wake up dead before they say anything. Why have all the lights gone out? There's a fault in the electricity. I don't get it, the lights go out and it gets hotter. Now there's nothing for you to worry about, go to sleep. - I can smell something. - What? Burning. Major. You fire, I'll open it, ready? - Any word from the Major? - Nope. He's probably having a quiet drink somewhere in the warm. Do you blame him? Couple of nurses thrown in for good measure. May I help? No thanks. I'm just waiting for the ward to ring through. It'll be light within the hour. I expect Dr Vernon's there by now. He should have taken me with him. Has the... patient said anything more? Not that I know of. Yes. She's just here now, hold on, Sister. Hello Sister, Dr Harland here. Well, give him the same dose as before. How's the temperature up there? I see, I'll come up as soon as I get a minute. Thank you. I hope we find his power pack. Yes, Sister. Yes, all right, I'll tell her. Sister Jenkins in surgical. What did she have to say? It's over 80 up there and all the windows are open. Oh, dear. - Oh, dear, we're all going to die. - Rubbish! Yes, we are we aren't going to get out of here. We're going to be burnt, oh my god. Oh dear what should I do? Oh dear what should I do? Now pull yourself together. I thought there was... where's nurse Lynne? She's safe, she's all right. Please help us. Don't complicate the situation, which is already very tragic. I'm sorry, I don't know what who are... Let me take the man and everything will be as it was. Well what about the man you killed in his house and the man you killed in a car, can you resurrect them? I'm very sorry for them, they were accidents. Blackburn died before we could touch him. All we wanted was to learn your spoken language. But if you don't raise this... this barrier you'll kill half the patients in the hospital. That is not our intention. It will be raised as soon as I can get to my ship. We did not realise that we are more advanced technically than you. Why did you kill Dr Carter? We did not mean to, we are peace loving people. And if you want, we could have done it more easily. We have a duty to perform, let us do it and we will go. - Where are you going? - Away. - But you can't. - Why not? Well you'll never get through the force field. It won't affect me or anybody with me. You're thinking that perhaps he's innocent, perhaps his story about women ruling his planet is true. It is not. It is the fantasy of an immature mind. You're disappointed that a civilisation such as ours should still produce destructive people. You're right to be. We are ashamed. I'll take you to him. If you come with me through the force field, you can at least phone for help. All right, I will. Hey, where are you going? What happened? Sister, what happened? - He took Dr Harland with him. - When? A few seconds ago. What about the Major? The man stabbed him. Don't worry, you'll be all right, just lie still. Major, where's the capsule? Field, behind Grange Farm. I'd better go after them. Dr Andrew's on his way down to look after him. Look I... Get down men, hold your fire. It's moving, scatter. - You all right. - Yes. You knew he was gonna take you with him as a hostage. No, I didn't, not 'till we were clear of the hospital then he said if I didn't go with him he would just kill anybody or anything, just to escape. Have you seen the Major, sir? Yes, he had an accident but he'll be fine. Come on. I think I prefer the idea of space being peopled by three eyed monsters. At least it was nice and remote. Now we've got them killing each other, just like us.
