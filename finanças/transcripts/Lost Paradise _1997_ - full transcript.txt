Presented by Kadokawa Shoten, Mitsui Bussan & Nippon Shuppan Executive Producer Kadokawa Tsuguhiko Produced by Hara Masato From the novel by Watanabe Junichi Lost Paradise See me home? What? Here you are. What do you do? I'm in publishing. You're here for work? Half work, half playing hooky. Hey, kuki! They want circulation up another 30,000! We're already up 10,000 from when you were editor. Well, Mizuguchi... That's what you get when you run all the magazines. Chief! You're supposed to call this number right away. Yeah, yeah... I wish they'd move me to an easy job! Let's have a drink. Come on! Hurry it up! After the meeting I'll be at the lab. So you'll be late... Oh, yes... get some Epoisses. Are we out already? You certainly like cheese! Try Fermier's if there's none at Kinokuniya. All right. The phone... Don't worry. That'll be my mother. Off you go. Yes? Oh, it's you... That was you just now, wasn't it. Just now? At this hour! That's not very discreet. I haven't had an indiscreet thought yet... But I hear your voice and suddenly... Tonight? I'm going out with a friend. Who? A male. It's been a while since we were out. Keeping busy? With what? After your sideways promotion we can't talk about work... You always were blunt... I'm not twiddling my thumbs there because I want to. You know what I've been thinking lately? I'd like to fall madly in love. Citron-flavored taro... Fried Autumn eggplant... Fish flakes on mine. Ginger and horse radish here. So have you got your eye on someone? Of course not! Although that little Mrs Print would be nice... Mrs Print? Matsubara Rinko... Remember when you lectured on writing at the culture center? You met her then. The beautiful calligraphy teacher. She won't write nice, rounded-off characters. She likes the printed style, so I call her 'Mrs Print'. 'Mrs Print'... Matsubara Rinko... Rinko... So where? Everywhere you touch me feels good... I mean where should we take a trip to? Anywhere... as long as I'm with you. Somewhere I've never been. Enter. Next weekend some college friends are planning a trip. Oh. Yoshioka's been promoted. Send him a gift. All right. Orchids again? We always send orchids... Something else, then? No, that'll do. Ah, I was one popular fellow once upon a time... What are you doing? Can you pack for yourself? I have to go to Kyoto. There's some material I need for my damn history series. I see. Sounds like a lot of work. Sorry. Were you waiting? Here. Well done! 'This hatred now... '...is retribution for jealousy past.' 'The flame of jealousy... ... consumes itself.' 'did you not know?' 'know it now, then.' 'A heart filled with jealousy! 'Oh! 'a heart filled with hate!' I've never seen Noh by firelight before. It was very good. It used to be pure firelight, with no electric lighting. Maybe the Noh the samurai saw was deeper... More eerie. Wait... I'll take a shower. You're fine this way. Tonight we don't have to go home. We'll pay for this... It was different again. It's different each time... It takes me further. It's scary. That word again... I wonder if it goes like that for everyone? No. Not everyone's in love like we are. Come here... See you home? What? It'll be that much harder to say goodbye. Is this all right? Just to your station. Hello. Well, look who's here! I finally get to come home, and you're away! Toru's away on business, and you went where? Kyoto? This isn't much of a souvenir... You're back early. Kyoto candy... a souvenir from daddy. Well, I'll go take a shower. He brought a gift... how nice. Doesn't the tempura there taste a little weird? Yeah? Yeah. A bit oily. Tea break: Mr Suzuki, your strawberry yogurt. Kyoto coarse tea for Mr Yokoyama. For Mr Kuki, Earl grey. Mr Muramatsu, you've almost used up your herb tea... Yeah? Agh, it tastes awful! Tea is something you drink for pleasure. It's not a health food. But they say it works. How much can it do? Tea is tea. This yogurt drink's good. The problem is the straw they give you with it... How far along are you in your history series, Kuki? Up to Abe sada. The woman in the 30's who cut off the guy's thing? I don't understand that. Yeah, dying for love! Falling in love so much that you'd do that! Slice! Ever been in love? Funny how a job with no deadline... never seems to end. Do you miss having someone always hurrying you up? Here you go. But Mr Kuki... Doesn't look as if he minds not being an editor any more. He looks fine. You mean the rest of us don't? It's how you view it. You don't have 'spare time', you have 'freedom'. Seeing fewer people means not so many idiots. And we can sit and drink tea and say whatever we want. Well, you can rationalize it that way. The problem is how to pass all this time we have. How's work going? Busy. It's winter-gift time. Is chinaware still popular? Tiles with designs, yes. People use them in bathrooms, or for hot-dish holders. I see... Well, I guess I'd better be going. After the reception I'm going out to Hakone... To a hotel near the golf course. Hey... Oh... see you. Special Mention Matsubara Rinko I know you're busy. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much. How have you been? Begin in prudence, end in devotion. She's quite a woman. I'll bet every man here thinks so. Thank you very much for coming. You look wonderful tonight. This guy can't take his eyes off you. This is Imai Midori, a friend from high school. How do you do. She's just been divorced from a frenchman. I see... say, why don't we all go for a drink later? I can't... What, you've got plans? Golf. I'm staying out near the course tonight. Thank you for coming. I know you're very busy. Well... Too bad. He's usually more sociable. Sorry, I couldn't get away... Shall we go? Just a minute... Hold this, will you? What, are you still here? I was a bit thirsty... Oh! Well, look who's here! I guess he's not coming... Who? Oh, someone important was supposed to come tonight. Well, if he stood you up, to hell with him. Come with us instead. You'll have another one, won't you? Uh, no thanks... Oh yes, you're playing golf tomorrow... Yeah... see you, then. Goodbye. The three of us, then... Is it all right? What? This is good... And you're beautiful. Good liquor and 'flowers on both sides'! Share my umbrella? Damn thing... Huh? I didn't mean to wake you... - When did you get here? - Just now. So you got here by yourself? Yes. Do you want to go in the bath first? Let's both go. At that point I had to put up a fight. A fight? You? Me versus sales, head to head. They wanted sales, I wanted quality. So now I have lots of free time. Well, your having free time is good for me. Shall we stay one more night? All right. It's strange... Has it always been like this? People bathed by the sun, listening to the wind... Doing the same thing over and over for ages untold? A man doing all he can to delight a woman... And the woman responding. No change, no progress... Just the same thing, over and over and over. But it's the woman who's the greedy one... It wasn't like that at the start. You had a special gift. A gift? Yes. A talent. Something good... Right here. Doesn't your husband say anything? I can't make love with anyone but you. Nothing's as good as this. He's a fine boy, isn't he. He's adorable. - You have a nice one, too. - Huh? Your 'Cookie'...Mr Kuki. Your husband doesn't know? No. I think I might fall in love, too. I need to be happy... For my sake and my son's. I've got someone in mind. I'll introduce you. What's he like? Every bit as nice as this boy here. Sounds great... This time he's Dutch. You're not suited to kids, are you. Here you are. Had lunch? Not yet, but I've got lots of time. What's on your mind? Well... In January they're farming me out to Maron Co. The affiliate? As president? Well, vice-president, for now. But even president... big deal! Being a salaryman is a real joke, isn't it. Once they don't need you, they just toss you aside. You aren't being tossed aside. A guy like you is just what Maron Co. Needs. All these years working my ass off, and what for? Now I know how you must feel. 'it is not at summer's end that Autumn comes.' what's that? It's from the miscellany of a Japanese priest. Summer doesn't just end and fall start... The summer heat prepares us for the chill of Autumn. I see... In nature and in personnel, the things we see... Happen because things have been moving below ground. We just don't notice them, that's all. I won't keep quiet and think of my pension like most do... when they're shunted aside. Hello? Oh, it's you... Some friend you are! Keeping your college drinking buddy in the dark! Word is you're getting it on with Mrs Print! You're a real piece of work! Midori told me. So are you and Midori... Don't talk to me about her! I ask her out and she brings her damn kid! Anyway, it's Mrs Print I'm calling about. About her? She came in a few days ago and asked me to keep her on. And not just two days a week. She wants full-time work. Four days a week. Might she be needing money for something? She looked a bit tired, too. Do you know anything about it? No. You don't? Well, I just thought I'd let you know. See you later. Yes? An application, please... Certainly. Matsubara residence... Were you watching TV last night? This show said girls now are crazy for middle-aged men. Really?! What kind of guy would they like? Well, we should make use of the sharp eye of a woman. Let's ask Ms Miyata. Who of us would be the most popular? I don't know if 'popular' is the word... But the one most likely to have a girlfriend... It's Mr Kuki. That's not so! It's the cell phone! I knew it! I suspected something... Mr Kuki gets the best part. He needs his strength. Oh, thanks. It's been years since I was in a love hotel. Me too. One where the concierge brings tea and rice crackers... She brings what? No, love hotels are out of date. So if by some chance I got lucky, where would I go? A first-class hotel, it seems. An affair would cost a lot of money... wouldn't it, Kuki. It sure would! This guy already owns his own house. His only daughter's married and his wife works. Money isn't a problem. He's not like us guys with mortgages. To play around, first you need money. And then time. Stamina! To have an affair... Without stirring up trouble takes true, mature affection. Can there be affairs like that, I wonder... Excuse me... Hello? Is that you? I'm sorry I haven't called. I'm happy you did! Where are you? My father's died. They called us this morning and told us to hurry. A heart attack... I didn't realize... Keep your head up. I will. Still, it's good to hear your voice. I want to see you. I want to see you... For an hour, even 20 minutes. If not tonight, tomorrow... Sorry... can you call back in five minutes? I want to see you... I can't tonight. Please understand. I could be dying at this very moment... - I want to see you... - I can't! I'll be waiting at the hotel. Here you are, sir. Thanks. Did it happen all of a sudden? Yes. He was very good to me. He was my step-father. Step-father? My real father... left us when I was three. My mother remarried when I was nine. He treated me just as if I was his own child. So you never saw your real father again? I don't even know where he is. All I remember is him... carrying me on his shoulders. His shoulders? I was still small. I was on his shoulders, holding his head. I remember the warmth of his neck... The smell of his hair tonic... No... We won't do anything. Just lay down for a bit. I had a call from Kinugawa. If you need some money... I thought we might talk about it. Or if there's something hard to discuss... It's because I want to see you, of course! I thought if I had more work... I could get away from the house more easily! I want you... Please! Just a little... I need you! I do this for you. It's all I can do. No... I want you... Make me forget! Haruhiko's gone ahead home. You'd better hurry, too. I'll stay here with you tonight. Well, it's a good thing Haruhiko's a doctor. He helped so much at the hospital... Life's so short, isn't it... Father was really very good to us... When he was with me, I felt so secure... Be sure you take good care of Haruhiko. After all, you don't have children... Hello... last night was hard, wasn't it. Are you hungry? No. I'm sleepy. I'm very, very sleepy. Um... thank you for all you did for my father... Yes... What was all of this for? Don't you like the way I do it? What are you thinking? How could a father like that and your mother make you? Toru, what are you saying?! Nothing... sorry. Toru wants kids right away. Well, we went and got married... Let's have some fun first. Having a kid is fun... Isn't it, mom. Father was busy from the day we got married. He didn't have time for fun. Or he pretended not to... I have to visit the director. I hope it doesn't turn into mah jong. A little mah jong sometimes doesn't hurt... Dad... be good to Mom, all right? You are good to me... Aren't you. What will the new year bring, I wonder... I want to see you more. To be with you more, and for longer. But what will happen if we go on like this, I wonder... We'll go to hell. Already? The new year's just started. I don't know about you, but I will. Acting like that the night my father died... Well then, let's go to hell together. All I'm going to think about from now on is seeing you. Kuki seems very busy these days, doesn't he. But he still seems to have time to shop. You're early. Bread, celery, fruit... A coffee-maker... And... Chateaux Margaux? It's a dish I like... Duck and cresson. Then I'll like it, too. Mm... it's good. It tastes even better when we're together. What are you thinking? Nothing... If we could only be alone like this... forever... I know everything you're doing, you know. Where you eat, what hotels you stay in... His name, too, of course. All in great detail. Are you having fun? What other mischief have you been getting up to? I won't divorce you, though. Without a divorce, you're still my wife. Do you have any laundry that needs doing? Mizuguchi? Cancer? It's spreading. He doesn't know, apparently. His family says it's best not to visit just yet. I see... When someone our age goes down... You start to think you'd better be prepared yourself. They were going to shift him out to Maron. That's wiped out. They've already moved someone else into that job. The reshuffle might have had played a part in this... The reshuffle? It happens a lot. You move out of the fast track... You lose your motivation and you get sick. Guys like him live only for their work. Are you off to the Diet library, Kuki? Yeah. Don't overdo it. Moderation... in everything. So this is the dope on us... Looks like he hired a good detective... I don't know. I don't want to know. 'October 8... 'After viewing a pottery exhibition in Nishi Azabu... '...the subjects dined at 'Kie' in Ryudocho... '...then checked into the Prince Hotel.' It's just like a souvenir scrapbook. It's natural to like someone and fall in love, isn't it? Well, you wouldn't fall in love with someone you hated. But once you're married, it's not allowed any more. Anyone except your husband and you're 'immoral', 'loose'. You shouldn't fall out of love with him... But people's feelings change, don't they? It you force yourself to stay with a man you don't love... You end up hurting him and betraying him. Is that all they can say when I'm so in love with you? That I'm 'immoral'? You're so proper, yet you have so much lust... You're always so serious... That lack of balance is what I love about you. Shall I say what I like about you? Is there anything? That lust has bent you completely out of shape. I'm back. Hello. I meant to come home, but I was with people from work. I would've called, but I was drunk and fell asleep. You don't have to do all this, you know. All what? Why don't we get a divorce? It would be better. I'd feel easier that way... And you'd be free and clear. Soon I'll be too old to start over again. But... why? This is so sudden... I'm confused... 'Confused'? Remember that we've had this talk, all right? So you talked to mom... What, you knew about it? So what will you do? Well... She's serious. To be frank, it's a complete surprise. Do you think all this time she never suspected a thing? Well, not exactly... But a divorce? She cried in front of me, you know... just once. But she's very strong. She wouldn't want to let you see. That'd be just one more blow to her self-esteem. I wonder if she really means to go on alone... Well, she'll be alone, so do all you can for her. You've certainly grown up, haven't you... Yep. Slowly but surely, I'm moving ahead. Well, I'm going. 'Last summer an employee of your firm, Kuki Shoichiro... '...forced his attentions on one Matsubara Rinko... '...a calligraphy teacher at the Towa Culture Center. 'Aware that she was married, he telephoned her repeatedly... '...and enticed her with skillful persuasion. 'He then lured her to frequent assignations... '...and last September took her to a city hotel... '...where he prevailed upon her to perform indecent acts.' I'm very sorry. I don't believe everything in this letter, of course... But since it's been sent, we can't just ignore it. It is true that you have been intimate with this woman? Yes. The girls like you, don't they. What would you think about a transfer to Kyoei? Kyoei Co.? I know it's sudden... I'm afraid your history series is being cancelled. That leaves you with nothing to do. Because of this? No, of course not. Take your time. Think about it. It looks like I'm going to be leaving you all. The director has told me... That as of April I will be moving to Kyoei Co. Application for Divorce I called late the other night but you weren't home. Where were you? Aren't you two getting along very well? The same as ever. I hope so. He's been such a help to us... Mother... I've I've fallen in love. I've fallen in love for the first time. Rinko! Don't be silly! You sound like your father! That's right. Even though he abandoned us, a father is a father. Of course I'm like him. I didn't raise you to be a tramp! A tramp? You're in spell to the call of the flesh! It's driven you crazy! If I'm a tramp, so are all women! You just refuse to accept it! They've finally operated, and he's feeling better. But the doctor gives him... Three months at most. Does he know? No, I haven't told him. I said they got it all, and he's going to be fine. You should wait till you're completely healed up. Now's your chance. I don't have much appetite. I've been rereading Shiki. Shiki? Oh, the poet... yeah, you write haiku, don't you. There's one about waiting for dinner... From his hospital diary. As death comes closer, it turns into... The wait for dinner. It's typical of Shiki. He couldn't move even a step from his futon. He passed the time by watching everything around him. And still dinner didn't come. And his final poem is really good... 'Flash! A ray of sun shines down on the tatami... 'and dinner is here.' 'Flash! A ray of sun shines down on the tatami... 'And dinner is here'... You're better than I thought you'd be. Hurry and get well. Maron Co. Will be lost without you around. Don't lie. You know better than anyone... That companies are set up so it's no problem... if one or two people aren't there. Kuki... I never played hard, like you. I always thought too much before I acted. But if all that happens is you get old and die... Then you're better off just doing what you want. My mother found out about us. We had words, and she said she never wanted to see me again. She said I was a tramp, and I should be pitied. She said what? She's right. My body has me in spell to you. My heart, too. So when you hold me... I'm yours in spirit and in flesh. Now I've gone and thrown everything away. As a matter of fact, I'm having problems, too. What's that? Read it. This is awful! Who would have... Who do you think? No... he wouldn't! So I'm being sent to an affiliate. Well, I guess I brought it on myself. Can't you say no? If not, you could always quit. Yes, I could. You've thrown everything away. Hold me... Hold me as tight as you can... I have something to say. I was neither prevailed upon to do anything... Nor was I enticed by skillful persuasion. Keep well. Have you gone out of your mind?! No. I am... As I should be. In Memoriam - Mizuguchi Goro Yesterday he took a turn for the worse. No one from the company made it in time. Of all the guys to get cancer, why did it have to be him? Mizuguchi was a good guy, good at his job. Going to a wake, though, you realize we're all the same. Even if you're in the best of health, you die someday. The only difference is who's early and who's later. He left a final poem. 'Was there not the love to burn up all the stubble?' 'a withered, fall field.' 'was there not the love to burn up all the stubble? 'a withered, fall field.' Yeah... Love... So how are things with Mrs Print? No matter where you're sent, don't do anything stupid. I called the other day... The girl had to struggle for an excuse why you were away. If you get fired, want to come lecture at the center? We're doing well. We got an award from the president. That's great. Work's all very well... But I'd still like to fall in love like you. The older I get, the more I'd like to. However... One false move and you lose important things. What important things? Your job. Your family... I've got cold noodles. I've got the jumbo size. Letter of Resignation What's this about? I'm an editor. Nothing else. I'd only get in the way over there. Aren't you selling yourself a bit short? I'm not the one selling me short. Thank you for all you've done for me. Why not cool down and think about this some more? I have thought about this... I'd like my resignation accepted. Yes, why don't you both just go abroad somewhere? Strike out together with someone you love. I'm glad you think that. Midori! Come here a minute! Anything can happen in life. It can't get any better. I'm happier right now than I've ever been. Happier than ever... That's right. But I'm scared. I'm too happy. I wonder if it can go on like this... I'll tell you a story. I was handling this novelist once. He was writing a story about lovers committing suicide. But this wasn't going to be your normal love-suicide. They were to die at exactly the same time... Clutching fast to each other. If they hanged themselves, one would have to die first. The author talked to a doctor friend... To see if there was a way this could be done. And was there? A drug. It they took it, they'd be sure to die simultaneously. And after rigor mortis set in... They couldn't be parted. Well... If I were with you, I wouldn't be scared. Shall we make love again? Of course! Do it so it's forever. Forever? Without end... forever. Anything new? The divorce... I've decided to get a lawyer to handle my side. You've lost weight, dad. You're looking well. It feels like we're a couple of strangers... It'll be spring soon. Thanks. I'll just look upstairs a bit. Thanks for these. Well... Take care. Don't go! Duck and cresson... Our own very special dish... Shall we go? Yes... No regrets? Regrets? None. It's getting harder for me to tell where my skin stops... And yours begins. It's become right for us to be stuck together. No one will be able to separate us. I'm not afraid... No more. Nor me. As long as I'm with you, I'm not afraid. When I was seven, I got lost in a lotus field. The sun was going down... I was so lonely... When I was nine, my dad bought me a baseball glove. I was so happy I went to sleep wearing it. When I was 14, I first wore stockings. My feet were sliding around in my loafers. When I was 17, John Kennedy was assassinated. I sat glued to the TV. When I was 25, I made an arranged marriage. There was a typhoon on our wedding day. When I was 27, my daughter was born. I was too busy with work to even go to the hospital. 38 years of age, summer: I met you, and fell in love. When I was 50, I first lost my heart to a woman. 38 years of age, winter: I am with you now, and always will be... Forever. Forever. Postmortem Examination Coroner's report on the deaths of Kuki Shoichiro... And Matsubara Rinko. The couple was found nude, in a tight coital embrace. Due to the effects of rigor mortis... They were separated only with great difficulty. Bodies are very rarely found in this situation. Cause of death: Suffocation from poison mixed with wine.
