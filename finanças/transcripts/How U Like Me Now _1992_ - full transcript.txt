(loud explosion) (clock striking) (smooth jazz music) - Hey I come here to work every day and I see these women getting ahead of me at work, every day, I see them getting the jobs that I should be getting, doing the things that I should be doing. I see them here at work trying to be just like men you know and I don't know where they're coming from. Now don't get me wrong I think a woman should work just not making more money then the man, 'cause it causes friction. - They can give the jobs to black women, white women, the Chinese or a damn chimpanzee for that matter. You see it's not gonna affect me in the least. I'm bringing home in the neighborhood of $63,000 a year. Drive this sweet little SX and in just a matter of days I will have closed on this rather nice lakefront home. So you see I truly do have the best of both worlds. I mean I go out with the cream of the crop in both black women and white women. And when you stop to think about it, deep down inside, every man wants to be just like me. And could you blame them, I didn't think so. (water running) - You know it aint affected none 'cause I aint got no job, I really don't want my motherfucking job you know. 'Cause that work shit it fowl, I mean everybody else getting paid 'cept you, event the government, and when you see Uncle Sammy bust a sweat, you know what I'm saying. I figure if I've gotta do something I drive a cab man 'cause drive motherfuckers around for money is easy as shit, till I hit that old ladies. I mean there's this old lady out in the middle of the street right and I figured she got Alzheimer's so I'm a help her remember where the fuck she at. Say old bitch get you arse out the street, right. She didn't move so I sped up on her just a little bit right. Tag her arse, cost my license but I had a laugh, straight up. - See I knew it was coming 12 years before it did so I've prepared myself, so I opened up a business right here in the neighborhood. That way they can't systematically oppress me. My only problem is finding a sister involved in the movement the black women of today are involved in them bourgeoisie European values, fake hair, fake eyes, fake nails, but talking about they want a real man. But when they see that they're not white and never will be they'll be back. In the meantime I'm gonna drop these newsletters off in their mailboxes till they wake up. * Treat me with respect and don't object, just check it * * And treat me with respect * You've got to give a heck and try to reflect * * And just check it, and treat me with respect * * You know it's no good to be checking on site * * It's shows your less a person not more of a man * * So give me my profits and the ends in sight * * And I'll treat you with respect * * And everything's all right * We all know our lives are shaped * * By what we choose to do * And some of us we just don't care * * Who we do bad things too * If you treat me right then I am sure * * That you will see * I'll treat you with respect, you've done the same for me * * Treat me with respect * Everything will be all right yeah * * Treat me with respect * Everything will be all right yeah * * Treat me with respect * Everything will be all right yeah * * Treat me with respect * And everything will be all right yeah * (smooth music) - Hey how you doing? - All right. - So what's up? - Working my fingers to the bone, all these nappy head assistants coming in here talking about make me look fine, give me the latest I wanna tell them there aint nothing I can do with them naps, especially the ones with the kitchens. But I tell them sit on down peer, I'll take care of you. - Now see I'm gonna do what you say about my hair when I'm not here. - Nothing, you're beautiful, I love working on your hair. - Yeah I bet. - How's work? - Well, I'm up for that promotion, and if I get it I'll be making so much money I might even have to pay you when I'm supposed too. - Hmm, well you deserve it, how's what's his name? - Now you know his name, Thomas, he's fine. - Are things improving? - We're trying, I'm trying. - I don't know what's wrong with you, you know what you need? - I don't even know why I said anything, don't start. - No I'm serious, you know what you need, you need a man with some cash flow, not somebody sitting around waiting to win the Lotto. - What did I tell you before, it has nothing to do with money. If I just thought that he was trying. - Well I'd like to see him try with no money. You getting your hair done today? - No, just a manicure. - So where you going tonight? - I'm going to ask Thomas to take us to Curry's. - Curry's, why can't you go somewhere nice? - 'Cause he can't afford it right now. - Forget what he can afford, if I were you, I would put my foot down. - Well you're not me so don't worry about it. - No you see I understand how they think. They think that if they can get the goods for free then why pay for it, if I were you I'd put my services on strike until he came up with some money. I bet he finds some then. - Do you hear how you sound? I am not a prostitute. - That doesn't have anything to do with prostitution, just don't settle for less. (laughing) - What man, what? Look man, she's totally into me I just want to make sure she's satisfied man. - Spoony, Spoony, I can't believe you really think that shit is gonna work. - Look man when I pop a woody, and old girl gotta play like Paul Bunyan, you're gonna be asking me if you can have some and I aint gonna get you none. - I don't think so, I don't think so besides how you gonna buy this shit. You don't look 21, you don't have a drivers license. - Look man I got all that shit taken care of okay. Let me show you, let me show you something. Bam (laughs). - Oh yeah that should do the trick. - Yeah. - Don't you think that's a bit extreme? - Look man Spoony do anything to get a nut off, anything, I'll be right back all right. - It don't even look real, what is that shit, piece of you momma's rug? - Can I help you? - Yeah I'd like to buy some Mr Big Cream, it's for my little brother he's out in the car. - Small, medium or large? - Which size do I need to get about 10 inches. - Hmm, how long is it now? - Just give me the large will yah. - Sure, here you go. - Thank you. - Sure. - Hasta la vista. It's time to go bust Jimmy man. - So how long before this stuff takes effect? - I don't know I gotta go home and read the instructions. - I can't wait to see how it works. - See? You better go ask old boy how it works, he aint seeing shit. - Boy shut up, let's go. - See how it works? (smooth music) - Hey. - Hey. It's a good movie. - So, are we still going out tonight? - You know I was thinking maybe we should take a rain check tonight, I don't think I can afford it. - Thomas you promised me we'd go out tonight. - Yeah I know but hey, what am I gonna do, you don't have it, you don't have it. - You'd have it if you went to work sometimes. - How much money do you have? - Why is it that every time we go out I have to chip in or pay for the whole thing? - Come on now, get with the program, it's the 90s. - I don't care what year it is, why can't you be a man sometimes and treat me like a lady? - Hey man, wait a minute, what does my being a man have to do with taking you out? - Look I'm sorry, it's just that you don't even try to do things for me. - Valerie come on you know how much money I make. - Honey there has got to be more to life then you making $6 an hour and hanging on the street with your friends drinking. - You only make $9. - At least I'm trying. - Hey come, I'm trying too, it's just easier for you. - Oh yeah here we go again, it's easier for a woman. - It is easier for a woman, you know that. And you know I always try. All right, all right, all right, all right, where you wanna go? - Anywhere except Burger King, I'll let you choose the place - Yeah well I'll surprise you, at least you aint got to be in the kitchen burning shit. (laughs) (suspenseful music) - Hey yeah. (screaming) Fuck that. - So Carl, just why did you become a Jehovah's Witness? - Because it eliminated a lot of the confusion in my life. - Yeah how so? - Well, when you live by God's word, life's heavenly. - Life's heavenly huh. Well listen tell me, what would you do in a situation like this right? You're involved with this woman and she knows what your financial situation is yet she still insists that you take her to the most expensive restaurant around, what would you do? - Am I married to this woman? - No, no. - Well I'd tell her to seek Jesus. (laughs) - You would, I'm sorry you don't have a woman now do you? - Gentlemen, a little less talk and more productivity here. - Yes ma'am. - Hello Carl. - Good afternoon. - Thomas, is everything okay. - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. - All right then well let's get busy here okay. - She's quite a lady, she belongs to the AME church. If she was a Witness I'd try to talk to her. - Why's she gotta be a Witness? - You don't mix the devil with Jehovah. - Carl, you shouldn't condemn people just 'cause they're a different religion. - Well all I know is there's only one way to become a righteous man. - Yeah right. - Look I'm gonna go try Jack. - Good luck. - [Carl] Want to come to one of the Witness meetings? - Hell no. (knocking on door) - Who is it? - Carl. - Carl who? - [Carl] Carl from merchandising sir. - Oh Carl, come on in. How you doing Carl? - Hi. - Have a seat. How can I help you Carl? - [Carl] I have a cousin Rosemary, she's a singer and I was wondering if you could do a story on her. - Carl is she top 40? - [Carl] No sir. - Does she have a video out? - [Carl] No. - Then she can't sell my magazine. - [Carl] I was thinking maybe you could do just a little article on her in the back. - No, how many times do I have to teach you all that I am not in the business of trying to make stars. I exploit them once they're big. Now get the hell out of here, and keep saying to yourself all day that exploitation of stars is money, money, money. Close the door behind you Carl. (car horns blaring) - See I'm telling you man, if Jesse had won the election this world would be a better place. - Oh yeah, how's that BJ? - We would have someone on the inside to look after our needs. - Man that black, white shit is so tired. BJ, our needs as you like to put it will be looked after when we stop being so complacent, start taking some control of our lives. I'm a tell you the truth man I voted for Bush. Yeah, Bush, you know why, 'cause Bush has the tendency to look after those of us who know how to look after ourselves, and I might add that might have just a little bit to do with why I'm standing here getting rich, and you, you're over there behind that counter, complaining like a bitch. - Look man it figures you would think that but you know what individual success doesn't mean anything compared to the collective. Sure you get you a couple of toms who they let slip through the cracks and then give them a few crumbs. - Tom, man who you calling a tom? - You, you the one always bent over for the white man. - Hey er, boys, boys, what's up? - Hey Thomas. - What's going on Thomas? - Nothing much, listen-- - No nothing much at all, we just here listening to Marcus Larvae over here, he's just taken another enema and he's spreading that back to Africa shit all over the place again. - Yeah, yeah, well that's real nice but I need a little favor. You see I need to borrow a little money, okay, a lot of money, well $100 you know, I gotta take Val out tonight. - Ah what is it, her birthday? - No man, you see this class thing it's kind of contagious and our friend here he's been hanging around me for a little while and I do believe I'm starting to rub off on him. He wants to explore some of the finer things in life tonight - No Alex we just wanna go out. - Man can't you take her somewhere more affordable? - You know that is a serious infraction of the perpetration laws. - You know something Alex you're deep. No man I'm just trying to take her somewhere nice because I guess I'm a little overdue you know. - You know what man, I had a lady pull that one me once. Wanted me to take her to this restaurant that she saw on television, I told her to get that media hype out there of how we're supposed to eat steak out of her mind, go into the kitchen and make us some tofu or she can leave. - What she do? - She left. (laughs) - Breakfast, lunch and dinner, BJ the poor girl probably just couldn't eat another bean pie. - No, no, no man she was a down sister when I met her. But see then my business went down and she had to go get one of them downtown jobs then she started meeting them shells of men, well dressed, looking good with a nice car, and then she turned into a handkerchief head like you. - What you mean is she developed some taste and class which is a good thing because as I recall she was one ugly sister. - Man you wouldn't know a beautiful woman if she slapped you in your face. - Tap, what am I, am I good for the money here or what? - Look man, I got $34 I can give you. - There's 16 I wouldn't pay a penny more for that heifer. - Thank you Alex, fuck you Alex. Thanks BJ. I'll see you later. - Okay, hey Thomas coming to my rally. - Yeah, yeah I be there. - You'll probably be the only one there too. - Do you have a reservation sir? - Uh yeah, Weinstein. - It just so happens that we have a cancellation but next time I do suggest that you make a reservation. - There won't be a next time. - Why you always gotta embarrass me? - Well I'm going to work for everything I want, I don't need a man to take care of me. - No Paula you're going to work for everything you get because you have too. - Why won't you just lay off Paula? - I just don't like the accusation she makes, she's too jealous. - Oh jealous of what? It's just that my body isn't up for sale. - That's because don't nobody want to buy it. - Are y'all gonna play cards or what? - She's just pissed because I'm tall, I have long pretty hair, I can wear Spandex and I'm lighter then you. - Sharon, you're a whore, and you make all women look bad and you need to stop. - Don't blame me for making you look bad. (phone ringing) - Hello. Oh sure Alex, when will you be by? Uh huh, see you then. That was Alex, you remember the rich guy, the one with the Corvette. The one that said you look like a turd. - I see he knows who to call when he gets a little extra money and wants a little sex. - Why don't you and your ugly ass momma just get on the bus and work your fingers to the bone okay. - We'll do that. - Guess what. - What? - Guess. - You want lobster now. - Now see I don't even wanna tell you now. - I'm joking, I'm joking, come on, come on, tell me, what, what. - I got the promotion. - Yes, that's great, that's great congratulations. - Now I'll be making $35,000 a year. - Whoa, wow, you can buy me that car. - No. - Come on, come on, that's excellent, that's excellent. You deserve it, you worked really hard, I'm proud of you. - The boss took me out to this real fancy lunch today. - You what, your boss took you to lunch? - He is 40 years old and married, don't worry about it. - Okay, okay. - So. Have you been thinking about what you want to do yet? - No I still really haven't figured it out yet. - Well, I can't wait till you figure it out 'cause once you do we can start on the future. - Welcome to Pierre's may I help you? - I need a touch up and please hurry. - You've never been here before, I never forget a perm, what's your name? - Sharon. - Sharon what happened to your last dresser? - He's not in, he's in Paris for the month and I have some place to go tonight. - Let's see how beautiful I can make you. - Pierre I have something to tell you. - What is it? - Bend down. Be careful I have an extension. - You mean a weave. - You know, you have a lot of tacky tacky nerve to bust me out in front of your customers like that. - Talk about tacky, look at this tacky weave you brought up in here. If God wanted the shit to be long, the shit would be long. - You know I do not have to take this abuse from you I have other places I can spend my money and I think I will go find one. I know where the door is. - Then use it. (smooth jazz music) - Pierre you are too raw. - I'm not raw, I just don't play that shit. If you gonna wear a weave be proud, don't go around trying to trick people. (smooth jazz music) - No bus yet. - I cannot believe I am standing here all dressed up waiting for the bus. - Rain, rain, rain, rain, why you always got to complain? Besides where's your car Miss It? - I knew you were gonna say that. Look I'm not trying to cause a fight. - Valerie look I know you think I'm walking through life with blinders on but I'm not. Hey I see what's out here but it's hard all right. Why can't you just be satisfied, content with what you got right now. - Content, I am so tired of being content. What's gonna happen when we get married? - I thought we'd live happily ever after. - And how are we supposed to give our children a better life if all you're living for is today and not for the future. - Man being with marriage you've got kids now come on. - Oh I'm sorry we're just supposed to fuck all our lives and never make a commitment. - Well you know honestly I never really gave it that much thought. - So Thomas where is this relationship going? - One step at a time is good for me, how's that grab you? - Where did he take you? - We went to the French Riviera, it was so wonderful. - Dave took me to Barbados for my vacation. - Valerie what did you say the name of your boyfriend was again? - Thomas. - Where did you and Thomas go on your last vacation? (doorbell ringing) - Who is it? - It's Pierre is Valerie home? - No she isn't. - Well she'll be home in a few minutes, do you mind if I wait? - Yes I do. - Go have a seat. Go have a seat. - No, no, no I aint here for that sister, all I want is some rubbers that's it. - I can't hear you. - I said all I want is some rubbers and I'm out of here. - Could you speak up I can't hear you. - Damn, all right you trying to bust me, all right. I said I'm getting some ass tonight and I need some rubbers. (laughing) What? - Thomas why didn't you let Pierre in the door? - Hey I was taking a shower I didn't want him in here roaming around. - You aint got shit I want. - Yeah well I was just making sure. - You are so childish, oh yeah I called your work today. - Well I was tired, so I took half a day. (burps) - Disgusting. - I'm sorry. - You don't have to apologize for that. - He is so frustrating sometimes. - I told you what to do about it. - I don't want to have this conversation again okay. - Going to the store, you want anything? - No. - You don't have to be so damn rude, you see me sitting here I might want something. - Here, suck on that, should hold you over till this evening. (laughs) - He is so tired. Like I was about to say to you, you have been seeing the wrong type of man. - What kind of man should I be seeing? - Valerie sit down. You need to get you a rich man. - I knew you were gonna say that. - With a rich man you don't have to worry about being embarrassed or anything. - That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Men are men, they're dogs. Probably wouldn't have anything in common with a rich guy anyway. - Like you have something in common with Thomas. - Yeah that's right. I don't know, we used to have so much in common but it's like he doesn't care about anything anymore. - See rich men believe in old fashioned tradition of treating a woman like a lady, with respect. - Now how would you know? - You don't think I go out with broke men do you? - I don't know what to do. - Look there's a party coming up for the Gold Coast Single Club, there'll be lots of single rich men there. - I cannot do that. - If you don't like it, you can leave. - Well, maybe it wouldn't hurt anyway. (suspenseful music) - Yo Spoony. - What up yo? - Give me two. - Dry or lubricated? - Lubricated. - That's $7 my brother. You only gonna crack two huh? - It's a start I just met her. - Get it for me one time black man. - Sure will. - Sexy money. - Thomas look at that. - That looks boring. Oh check this out, see that? - Thomas? - Oh come on Valerie, $2 for a flower that's gonna die tomorrow, I don't think so. - I wonder where they're going? - Going to work, that mans a waiter. - You're so romantic. - Come on let's go home. Oh yeah, oh yeah oh baby, oh baby, oh yeah. (groaning with pleasure) - Hey, hey baby what's wrong? - Nothing. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Come on baby, tell me what's wrong. - Why would you think there's something wrong? - You know I've been with you for eight months now, and I know that something is wrong. - Surprised you're that sensitive. - What are you trying to say? - I'm tying to say you're over there huffing and puffing like you conquered the world or something. - Damn Val you bitch about everything, I just finished. - Yeah I know what you just finished. What about me? - You didn't, you didn't-- - No I didn't. I mean do I ever? - Now that's a fucked up thing to say. You see I thought you did. - That's because all you think about is satisfying yourself. I mean as bad as things are between us you think that I could at least be sexually satisfied. I mean the way I see it that's all you're good for and you can't even do that. - You know something you can really be a serious bitch sometimes. What the fuck am I supposed to do? - You can try thinking about my needs sometimes. - All right, all right I'm sorry. Listen just give me a few minutes all right and I'll work it back up. - You don't need a few minutes. - Well it's not like I got an on and off switch you know. - You can do something else. - Something else like what? - You know. - What? - You know. - Valerie have you lost your mind? Have you fucking, I just finished fucking you. - Fucking me, you know what you're exactly right, you did just finish fucking me, satisfying yourself. - I can't believe how crazy you are girl. I mean you know how nasty that shit is? - Yeah about as nasty as having somebody on top of you who don't know what the fuck he's doing. - Hey, hey, I can say what you want, but I ain't doing that nasty shit. - Yeah well fine, you don't ever have to have sex with me again, it's not like I'm getting anything out of it anyway. Why don't you just turn your poor ass around and go to sleep. - Why you always got to throw that shit in? - Because you're a broke motherfucker. * Lets treat each other with respect * - So as you already know I had to call this meeting because our sales are down 2.3 million dollars from last quarter, and Jack isn't happy. And this morning he said that he will be laying off a few people within the next 30 days. These are your performance records, they'll give you an indication of what you did last quarter, what you didn't do this quarter, and where we expect you to be by the end of the month. It will also give you a good indication as to whether your job is in jeopardy, and if you are in danger you have 30 days to get back on the right track. Now I suggest that we work real hard to bring those performance levels up. I wish each of you good luck, and let's get to work. Thomas I'd like to speak with you for a moment. - Yeah sure. - Thomas I'm particularly concerned about you because your performance levels have been so far below par that it's almost a cinch that you're going to get fired. Thomas, what do you have to say for yourself? - Well I've just, I don't know, been having a lot of problems lately. - It's been more then just lately, your performance levels have been down now for several months. - Yeah I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. - Thomas, did you know that your placement scores ranked you in the top 25%? - No I didn't know that. - Well they did, and based on that information quite frankly I'm real disappointed in you. Thomas if there's anything that I can do to help please let me know, okay. Okay. - Okay. - Now let's get to work. - I tell you man Alex got it going on man. He got these fine sisters man. - Man, he's as lost as hell bro. - Lost in that looked good to me. - Them gold diggers, as soon as his money runs out so will they, he be hanging out with Martha over there. - That? She foul man. Her hairs so nappy Moses couldn't put a part in it. - Your brothers got a lot to learn man. - Yeah, yeah. (doorbell ringing) That's ugly man. - [Thomas] Who is it? - It's me and Baby Malcolm. - [Thomas] Yeah well I'm having a discussion I'll be right down. - All right. (sexy romantic music) - Val please, don't go out tonight, not tonight all right. - Don't be stupid, nothing is gonna happen to your job tonight. - I just think we should be together tonight, that's all. - Oh yeah well what about the times when I needed you and you were out with your friends hanging in the streets. - I can't believe that you're comparing this time of crisis to some stupid shit like that. - It wasn't stupid to me, excuse me. - Valerie. - No. - Valerie. (doorbell ringing) - [Valerie] That you Pierre? - Yeah it's Pierre. - Yo P man, let me ask you a question. What's a brother like you do for fun man? - You'll never know. - Oh man why you gotta get all smart and shit man. I bet you go to the deli and like pick up a roll of salami right, run around to the drug store and get a tube of Vaseline and you and the girls make sandwiches all night. - Look you don't need to worry about my evenings, what about yours? - No problem man. - You baby, let's pick up a 40 ounce, get a two piece chicken dinner, take it back to the crib, turn on the radio and if you can find it and I can get it up we'll both get some tonight, word. - Well that's real funny. - Punk motherfucker. You know what you're doing to our women? - Yeah nothing. - Listen man with the shortage we need all of our men for the survival of the race. - That's funny, the women I talk too don't complain about the shortage, they complain about the black men not being about shit. - What are you saying man anyway? - I see a strength, I see a side of manhood that most people never see. - Yeah the back side. - Love, trust, respect, qualities that surpass a black man stereotype, I have found in my brothers. And if you're lucky enough to find these qualities in someone man or woman, I suggest you hold onto it and be proud. - Valerie, Valerie. - Let go. - Are you ready? - Let's go, hello BJ. - Hello Valerie. - That's fucked up you know that, that's really fucked up. - What's that man, Valerie going out with Pierre? - No man the fact that I can lose my job any day and she's going out partying. - Hey guys, what's going on? - Working like clockwork man. - Oh shit. - Told yah, working like clockwork. - And what does Mohammed BJ have to speak about on this fine night? - What I'm speaking about man is by the year 2000 70% of our brothers gonna be unemployed, in jail, homosexuals or on drugs. - Where does he get this nonsense from? - It's not nonsense man, so you need to educate yourself. They already said that the best place to hide information from a brother is between the pages of a book. - Well, at least one thing we know is I'm in that 30% percentile. - What difference does it make if you don't reach back? - I was kind of thinking man, you know, you be sounding right sometimes you know, 'cause I don't be doing shit half the time and I could be doing something a little better you know. - Trifling, simply trifling man. Do you know what I see when I look at you guys? - No Alex what do you see? - Tell you what I see, what I see is a bunch of lazy, self defeatist, slave mentality type niggers. Who don't have the gumption, or let me break this down for Mr Spoony over here, the balls, to pick themselves up and do something with their lives. - Too bad for us because you've been brainwashed to run from that which is real man. - Real? What the hell you talking about with this real stuff? Everything about me is real BJ. I mean just today I pulled me another Caucasian persuasion. - So what's that supposed to mean Alex? - Come on get with it Thomas. What is means is I'm extraordinary because it's quite obvious that not every brother can have himself a white woman. - Hey you're right cause they're gold diggers, they go after you simple brothers with money. (laughing) - I can sure smell the jealousy in the air tonight. - That's not jealousy, you just don't see dogs mating with cats and cats mating with rats, and all that kind of stuff. - BJ what is this dog, cat, rat shit got to do with who I'm sleeping with? Man listen, I believe in a colorless world and not you, you and especially not you will tell me who to adorn myself with. - See they got you to assimilate to that kind of thinking. - So how do they do that? - Stop encouraging that motherfucker man. God damn. - That's all right I'll tell you, it was back in the 70s when we had out unity and they knew that in unity there was strength right. So then they came in, they stripped us of it so we all be like Alex. - Whole lot of hot air out here but I'm still not hearing how. - I'll tell you how man, it was back in the day when we were learning who we really were. (upbeat music) - I told you Rosa Parks did the right thing. - You know you right man, and ever since that incident happened we've been together in the struggle. - Yep, we even got out own black movies coming out now. Speaking of which I think it's time for that movie. - Let's go and check this thing out. Yeah bro, I wants me a Cadillac and a white bitch. (laughing) - Now that was the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life. Thomas listen to me man, just forget about Valerie she don't count, go out here and get yourself two or three of those little, well you know the kind of jobs you can get. Save yourself some money boy and then you'll go out and find yourself a new woman and this time Alex promises you, you will keep her. - Alex, yo my man, you don't have a clue. - Hey Alex, remember you're black. - Y'all talking that crazy shit man, I'm out of here. - Hey Thomas, don't worry about it man, things gonna be all right. - I mean how could the bitch do this to me. - See from what you just said I probably can tell you. - Um Mark, I really need to talk to Pierre for one second, can you excuse us, one minute? - Why you introduce me to crazy people? - What's wrong with you, you could have gone to see Rick James, I told you the man had big bank. What is wrong with you? - You saw how crazy Thomas was acting at the house. - What's up? - He's probably gonna lose his job. Pierre look, that guys been looking at me ever since we sat down. - Which one? - The one in the tan suit. - But he's a-- - Yeah I know what he is. - Look Thomas may not be the best, but you want to do that? - Why don't you go talk to your friend Mark, and maybe he'll come over here and talk to me. (laughs) * Maybe as soon as it seems * Oh my lover, you are the last * - Can I sit down? - Yeah sure. - Look lets just get to the point, do you wanna go out some time? - Yeah, I do. - What's your name? - Valerie. - Valerie, Brandon. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Can I get you a drink? - Yeah sure, Perrier water. - Okay one Perrier and a beer please. You know I'm here all the time, I'm surprised I haven't seen you. - Well this is the first time, I came with my friend Pierre. - Oh. - Here you go. - Thank you. Um, would you like to dance? - Um, yeah sure. - Great. So what do you do? - I'm a computer programmer for Comtex. - Oh my God, what a small world, I handle their account. - You're kidding, what are you a sales man? - I'm a trader. - Oh that's good. - Yeah, it's got it's highs and lows. - Looks like we have a short dance here. Why don't you come over here and let me introduce you to a friend of mine. - Sure. - Um Brandon this is my friend Pierre, Pierre, Brandon. - Hello, nice to meet you. - Look Valerie, I gotta get going but dinner tomorrow night? - Sounds great. - Great, let me get your number. - Oh okay, um you know what why don't you give me your card and I'll give you a call. - Oh great, sure. Here you go, so tomorrow night eight o'clock. - Sounds great. - It's nice seeing you, nice meeting you. - It was nice to meet you. - And I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Okay. - Great, bye. - That is mine. (somber jazz music) - I just wanted to let you know that was real selfish what you did tonight. - Selfish, you got a lot of nerve calling somebody selfish. You have to be the most selfish person I've ever met. You know Thomas you have got to start doing something with your life, I am tired of you being a bum all your life. - Do me a favor and just stop bitching at me just for once, just for a minute here. - You know what you're right, I'm sorry, it's not like it does any good anyway. - All right, all right, since you're so unhappy with me why don't you just pack your shit and leave? Yeah that's right, you go ahead, you find somebody else 'cause I'm sick of this shit. - You're sick of this shit? - Yeah. - Well then fine I will leave. - Good, get the fuck out. - Don't you even think it will be hard to replace you. (fingers clicking) - Just hurry it up bitch. I can't believe you're really doing this, especially at a time like this. - What do you mean especially now? - I'm losing my fucking job. - So how long did you think they were gonna let you just take off and mess up? - Look, can we just um, can we just try to give this another shot? I'll get my shit together baby, I just need you, I need you. I need you now more then I have ever needed you before. - Thomas I'm sorry but it's like we're moving in two different directions. I need somebody who wants to do the same things that I do. If I stayed here now you'd be fine today, but next week you'd be back to the same thing. - Valerie, you gotta give me another chance. You gotta give me another chance Valerie. - Try not to be here tomorrow, I'll come get my stuff. Thomas I really hope you get your life together. - Yeah. - Seems as if this was bound to happen man. - I don't know, I just wish she hadn't left. You think we could have worked it out? - To be honest with you man Valerie was base level. - Base level. - Yeah see man, put people onto three levels right. The first one is spiritual which I'll say is about 8% of the population. See you get a woman on this level and you'll be happy forever. - What are the other two levels? - Well the second is the intellectual. These are the people that try to apply logic to everything, lot of book sense but no common sense. Then the third is the base level person, they're into cars and sex and money and all that superficial stuff. I hate to say it but this is the largest segment of the population. - Yo how much for the paper? - 20 cent. - 20? - 20 cents. - 20? - Yo man the man said 20, two dimes, give the man the money, damn man. - Thank you brother. - That brother looked like a cricket man didn't he? All right, all right what up yo. - Peace bro. - Man I'm telling you man I'm taking you to this going on ass party tomorrow man. - Nah man, I don't feel like going to a party. - For like, man I know you aint up and worried about Val are you man? - I just don't feel like going to no party okay. - Okay man look, I don't see why not. I mean it's gonna be much, much, much ass there man. I'm talking about ass, all over the place. - Spoony, Spoony, see what I tell you, base level. * We got to try to love one another * * Do the right thing * We got to try to love one another * * Do the right thing - You wrote this? - Mother maybe that is a stereotype just like the ones they have about us. - I understand you wanting to leave Thomas but I just think you're going off the deep end. - Are you prejudice? - No I'm not prejudice, I just know you're doing this for the wrong reasons. - What do you mean? - Look Valerie if you just happened to meet a white man and he was nice to you then you'd have my blessings. You start telling me how they treat your coworkers and I know you're tripping again. - I am not tripping again. How can you say that there's no difference? - I'm not saying there's no difference I'm just saying that any difference that you think exists is more then individual thing and not a racial one. - Okay well we'll see, do you know where the vase is? - It's in the pantry, why do you need it? - For the flowers that Brandon's gonna bring me. - I thought when someone brings flowers it's usually a surprise. - Now see that's why I'm making the change, they always bring me flowers on the first date. - Oh please, I just hope you're not setting yourself up for a big let down. - Well mother when Brandon and I are in Europe I'll give you a call. - God bless you. (doorbell ringing) - Now see he's even on time. - He's probably anxious to see if it's true. - If what is true? Hi, why don't you come in and meet my mother. - Great. - Mother this is Brandon, Brandon this is my mother. - Hello Mrs Young nice to meet you. - Oh my pleasure Brandon. Oh I have something for you. For you. - Thanks. - I'll take care of this for you. - So where are you two going tonight? - To a restaurant or wherever she wants to go. - Sounds good. - Yeah. - Well don't let me hold you back. - It was nice meeting you Mrs Young. - Nice meeting you Brandon. - See you again sometime. - Maybe next time I can cook dinner for you and Valerie? - Sounds great. - Goodbye mother. - Night. - Yo sis what they get you for? - Brandon, this is my brother Andre, he thinks he's a comedian. - Oh I get it I was supposed to be a police man, how funny, nice to meet you Andre. - I forget, how the heck are yah. - I'm all right, I'm all right. - Go on in the house, I will see you later. - Dope. - Dope? Hey don't you think you're a little too young for that. - Huh funny. (upbeat dance music) - You know would you lighten up man, this is a party not a funeral. - Yeah I knew I shouldn't have come out here. I don't know how I let you talk me into this shit. - What up homey? Sit down man, sit down. I'm telling you man the honey's is here, and they all over the place so don't be slow driving. Check out old girl, she's fine. She got a trunk of funk. - She does look good doesn't she. - Yeah well that means you should go mack her down. Go on, go get her. Yeah, go on. I don't know what to say. You know how long it's been man. - Look Thomas I understand okay, but Valeries gone, her days are over. - Right Valerie's gone. - You need some yams. - All right. - Go get them. - All right, you're right, you're right. - Go get them. - I'm going. Do the right thing yeah. Do the black thing I'm going. - Go, go, go. * You don't have to worry - Hey how you doing? I'm Thomas, and I was er, well I was, and em-- - Hi, my name is Shirley, would you like to buy me a drink? - A drink yeah, what are you, what are you drinking? - A sloe gin fizz. - Sloe gin fizz all right coming up. - Baby we should just go back to my crib and get busy I'm telling you. - But I don't know you. - Ooh baby that don't mean nothing. We can get acquainted back at my crib. - Someone as frank as you I don't think you can handle me anyway. - Slow gin fizz, Shirley, if I, if I put a move on you am I gonna get turned down? - It depends. - On what? - On how drunk I get. - Let me straighten you out baby. Jimmy's strapped with four big inches. - So have you ever gone out with anybody black before? - You know I haven't really on a kind of one on one basis but I have a lot of black friends. - So why'd you go out with me? - Why not I mean I find you attractive. - That's a good reason. I don't know if you could tell but my mother's a little apprehensive about us going out tonight. - Yeah so that's what's going on between you two huh. - Yeah I mean I told her, I said mother, it shouldn't make a difference what race somebody is. I mean we're all the same right. - You know, now that I think about it there might be a small difference here and there but I mean we don't have to let it get in our way. - No we're all God's children. - I agree. So tell me what do you like to do? - Go to the symphony. - Do you really? I love it, I love Danielle. - Oh yeah he's great. - You know, you're all right just like your brother. - Why? - Well she's one of the greatest conductors around and you call her a man. - Oh. - Look I'm sorry I didn't mean that, it's a bad habit of mine. - I really like shopping at Neman Marcus. - I always thought they were a little overpriced. - Well you know they say you have to pay for the best things in life. - Guess you're right. Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean that. - Thomas used to do that. - Thomas? - My ex-boyfriend. - Hmm, so I take it that kind of thing bothers you. - I think it's disrespectful. - You know Valerie I never understood why women get so shook up over something like that. I mean it's just like if you're looking at a car or something, it's not that big of a deal. - What you think that women are objects? - No it's just that I mean all women look different and as long as you don't lust, I mean, I don't see anything wrong with it. - Yeah I know I just figured that if a man is out with me he shouldn't be looking at anybody else and if he does maybe he shouldn't be with me. - You're that jealous kind of type aren't you? - No. - Yeah you are, I know you are. - Well maybe a little. - That's cute. - So what time do you go to work in the morning? - Hmm, about 8:30. - Would you like to go for a walk in the morning? - Yeah that'd be great I'd love too. - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. - Come on you gotta be thinking about something. - Look what does nothing mean, I said nothing all right. - Could you please not twirl my hair I don't like it. I don't feel comfortable with it. (laughs) - You know something I really don't give a fuck what you don't like . - What is your problem? - You. You're my problem, do me a favor, get the hell out of here. - What? - Just shut the fuck up and get the fuck out of here! - You know you are really sick, you are sick. (gentle piano music) - Now see that's another thing about Thomas, he wasn't romantic at all. He thought it was stupid to go for walks and go to plays and stuff like that. - That's crazy, you know Val it really seems like you weren't too satisfied with him. - Yeah that's right, now see, look at that building. That's exactly how I wanna live, penthouse apartment, doorman, big car, all the best things in life. - Val that sounds great but how do you plan on getting all of these things? - Thomas I really hate to have to tell you this but I was in Jack's office earlier this morning and I caught a glimpse of the pink slip list that he had on his desk, and your name is near the top. - Well you know something Michelle it really doesn't matter. - Thomas, you've either been a no show or late for work for the past two weeks. Now I don't know what it is that you're going through but it can't be the end of the world. - You don't understand, Valerie left. - Valerie, who's Valerie? - Well she was my lady till she got tired of me not being able to take her out and buy her expensive things so she left. - First of all, any woman who would leave you because you can't afford to take her out really isn't a woman. Secondly, this is a good company, and I would hate to see you tarnish your work record by getting fired. Thomas, there are some good women out here. But you have got to get your act together if you hope to meet one one day. As for right now you really shouldn't even be thinking about a lady, you should be focusing on getting your life in order, can you do that? Think about it okay. - Hey, thanks. - So is it true. - About this new guy? - What are you two talking about? - Lisa told me what he's like. - Oh I get it. - So what happened to what's his name? - Thomas, we're not seeing each other anymore. - So what does Brandon do? - Oh well he's a trader. - Sounds nice, have you been out yet? - Yeah he took me to dinner last night and then he took me for a walk this morning. - Oh them were the good old days when George picked me up. Of course when he first started dating. - He stopped? - Of course he stopped, all men do right? They wine and dine you at first and when they get used to you they stop. - Better enjoy it while it lasts. - What's up? - Whoa, so how was traffic? - The worse, the worse. - So what are we gonna do today? - I didn't tell you, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to take a rain check today. I'm in a tennis match at the country club. - Well can I go? - Look maybe another time it's not a good time. - I wish you had told me I could have found a way home. - No it's okay, I can still give you a ride. Okay, so how was your day, good. - Very tiring. - All right I need to get to this rally man. - One more, one more, just one more all right. - Come on man, let's go man. - All right, all right, all right. I was walking on the beach right getting high with some of the homies and we saw this female in the sand. She didn't have no arms, no legs right. So she called me over and says, excuse me I aint never been hugged before. So I figured she wanted a hug, I gave her a hug right. The next thing you know she said, excuse me I aint never been kissed before. So I was like fuck it, I give her a kiss right. Then she pulled me real down close to her and she was like, I aint never been fucked before. So I picked her up, threw her in the water and said you fucked now. (laughing) - All right man. - Be cool. - Peace. - Brothers a fool man. (smooth jazz music) (car tires squealing) (car horn blaring) * Girl we've come so far * What about my heart * Don't you even care anymore * I can't believe you say * You've thrown it all away * As if there was no love ever there * * As if we never loved before * I never meant that much to you * * You believe you won't stay to see it through * * Did you know you would break my heart today * * And you tear it all apart and just throw it away * * I never knew that I could hurt so bad * * Never. (crying) * I never knew it would hurt so bad * * When I think about the dirty love that we had * * Should have known when the fire wasn't in your eyes * * I was in too deep to realize * I didn't know * I never meant that much to you * * Can't believe you won't stay to see it through * * Can't you love me baby * It's hard today * Why didn't you let me know, * Why didn't you let me know - Hey what up Spoons. - What up man, what the fuck you doing up in there? - Was talking with a friend of mine from high school. Ex-criminal, now he's the pastor of this place. Guess he was just giving me some of his truths. - Look man you bring your arse to the crib around 8:30, I'll hook you up on some truths. - Not those kind of truths Spoony. - Man I hope you aint letting Valerie make you lose your mind are you man? - Oh Spoony you wouldn't understand. - Oh man don't even try to fade me like that man, see that's the problem you niggers start going to college and church and all them places and you come out thinking you're all that, but you aint. - Yeah you know I don't think I'm all that. I aint better then anybody else, I just went in there to check out the service all right. - Look man I just hope there's no fucking with our friendship 'cause I aint gee for that church shit. - Spoony don't talk like you don't have the sense you were born with all right. - I bet you got the Holy Ghost though didn't yah, I bet you you did. - Yeah, I got your Holy Ghost. - [Brandon] Hello. - Brandon it's Valerie. - [Brandon] Hey, how you doing? - Fine, I was um, wondering if you'd like to go to breakfast this morning? - [Brandon] Oh I'd love too but I gotta run, I have a breakfast meeting this morning at work. But can we get together after work? - Oh sure. - [Brandon] All right, um, pick you up at the same time. - Okay I'll see you then. - [Brandon] Bye. - Bye. - Marty it sounds like a real attractive offer but I'm not ready to make a move just yet. (knocking on door) Oh hold on one second. - Cheryl, how you doing, you got a minute? - Sure, sure, come on in. Listen Marty I'll have to call you right back okay. Bye bye. So what's on your mind? - Uh listen I was wondering if there was anything I could do to um, save my job? - Oh really, so why the sudden change? - Well I guess I figured that er, if I didn't do something with my life soon I wouldn't amount to much. - Wow, I'm glad to hear that you're finally thinking that way. So what happened, did your girlfriend come back? - No, I er, I just want to make a change. - Wow, I'll tell you what if you're really sincere about making an improvement I'll have something to take back to Jack, and you know that I have Jacks ear. - Yeah, yeah. - So, do we have a deal? - Sounds like a deal to me. - [Cheryl] Okay (laughs). - Thanks. - It was really nice of you to make dinner for me. - Oh it was my pleasure, can I get you something else. Perrier water, I bought it just for you. (laughs) - Um, I have to tell you something, I hate Perrier water, I um, I told you that when I met you because I didn't know what to say, and it seemed like the right thing at the time. I was really nervous. - Oh come on, it didn't matter to me. - Why don't you tell me about your family? I haven't met your parents yet. - Man let me tell you I thought I knew all about women, turns out man I'm just beginning to learn. - That's 'cause you have to learn to make love to a womans mind man, anybody can have sex with them. - Yeah, yeah, now I know what happened between you and your woman. Her mind was feeling good but her body wasn't feeling like nothing man. - No, no, don't get me wrong now brother, I know how to physically satisfy a woman too, I'm just saying she needs more then that. - Spoony I bet you do what I used to do all the time just bust your nut, roll right over and go to sleep right. - You know that shit dog, she better get it while it lasts 'cause it's going fast. - Yeah but doesn't that make you stop and think why you can't hold onto a woman? I mean they gotta be tired of being treated like sex objects. - You know you really shouldn't be so hard on black men, you just haven't found a good one. - I'm not hard on them, I just know they aint no good. They just out to use you for what they can get. - What are you complaining about, you get paid for it. (laughs) - Oh here we go. - I mean look at me I've got a good man. - A good man? - Yeah. - He works at the gas station. He's the reason our average income is so low. - All right he doesn't make a lot of money but he treats me right. Now I don't sit around bitter about men, or jump at their every whim because they bought me. - You know things always seem to work themselves out for a reason 'cause the men I know they wouldn't want you. - Back to that again, Sharon what's wrong? I thought you and Alex were going out? - Oh Alex is not like a real boyfriend. Shoot he just comes around sometimes. I don't know, they either conceited, broke, or uneducated, I think they all messed up. - You shouldn't think that way 'cause if we don't believe in them for sure no one else will. - There you go. - Look at him over there. I bet you he's a drug dealer. - Nope, I'm an accountant. - And look at him, I bet you he's running from the police. - Nope, I'm late for work. - Ooh, my God, now see that is my kind of man. I bet you he's an engineer. - Hello ladies. - Hi. - Hello. - Hey how you doing? - Okay. (laughs) - Hey! - Am I learning something here or what right? No, no a woman not only want physical love, she needs that mental love, that spiritual love and the emotional love too. - See that's something that you brothers aren't doing. - You know I think I've figured out why some women just might fall for a clown like BJ. I mean his whole game is crying, begging, playing up to them, he's just like that pathetic singer, what's his name, er, Ray Parker Junior, he used to try to put in his music. * A woman needs love just like you do * Scratch all of that, you don't have to be whining like some puppy dog, old girl gets hurt you just take her downtown and you buy her something. Next thing you know she's feeling all better. Now preferably you wanna get her some nice lingerie so she can make you feel better later on. (laughs) - Now see that's what you have to do. See when I make love to a woman I hold her in my arms and I let her know that she's mine, and that together we're strong right. I use foreplay to stimulate her, plus I'm sensitive to her needs. - Oh man, man, man, tell you man by the time you get started with all that nonsense I'm through, Jimmy's wet and I'm catching some Z's up in the corner, man, get out of here with this. - That's why we all need to follow up behind you Spoony and make sure we satisfy your women because we know you won't be satisfying them. - Come on Spoony man we need you to be a man for our women, don't you know that's one of the main reasons that women leave men 'cause you all are all insensitive and all you think about is yourself? - Tell you the truth guys, I can't even relate to the stuff y'all talking about. As a matter of fact, most women they get all hot just looking at me. - Man, man, Alex come on back down to Earth with us, join us here on reality street with that shit. - No man straight up, listen, just the other day I had this divine creature in bed with me and you know she had the nerve to bet me that in three tries I couldn't knock her arse out. - So you fucked her three times and busted her head with a brick. (laughing) - Y'all pathetic man, listen I'm out of here later. - All right homey take care. - What are you watching? - This show it's crazy, I've never seen anything like this before. - What's so funny about it? - Val you gotta check it out, there's these black guys they're all walking around town going yeah, where's my hoe, tag up dog yeah. I've never seen anything like this before. - And you think that shits funny? It's exploitive. - Yeah so what I'm saying is I'm trying to get my shit back -- - Man Thomas as soon as I brought in the crib man she was just like -- - Trying to do better at work. - Over me man. - I'm thinking about going back to school. - She just whipped her bra off and her titties just blam, fell out all over the place. - Why do we always have to talk about women like this? - Nipples this big. - Spoony, spoony you don't even hear a damn word I'm saying. - And it was just waiting on me, waiting-- - You're momma. - Just calling me, said Spoony come get it, Spoony come get it-- - With a big fat skanky ass Spoony. - And she was just woo man, and finally I was just getting ready to grab her ass-- - Spoony what is that on your lip, a big old fat herpes sore? - Thomas I'd like to see you in my office for a moment. - Me? - Yes you, your name is Thomas isn't it? - So, why do you think I've called you into my office? - I'm fired? - No just the opposite, you've been doing remarkably well, and I just wanted to tell you to keep up the good work. - Yeah well, I'm working, you know, I've been, I've been trying, I've really been trying you know that. - Yes I know and Jack has taken notice. As a matter of fact he wants me to start working with you a little more closely. - That's great. - Yeah. - That's great. - Congratulations. - Yeah thanks, I've really been trying. Thanks. - Well carry on. - So this place you're taking me has great barbecue huh? - You have to go to the south side for barbecue, it's the best. - I hate this. - What? - Did you see them back there? The way they're all standing around wasting taxpayers dollars. - They're homeless, where are they supposed to go? - School, they can get a job. - These people are trying to find shelter and they're supposed to be able to go to school and do homework at the same time? - Oh come on don't you think that's a cop out? - No I don't. Brandon you know who your parents were, you had a role model, these people have had to rely on themselves all their lives. - So what are you saying? - I'm saying too often we want to take credit for how we end up in life, but say for instance you had to relive your life through one of these peoples experiences, do you really think that you'd still be a trader? - Of course, Valerie that's the great thing about living in America, rich or poor, black or white, Chinese, whatever, we all have a chance. I mean what do you think Federal Aid is for? That's why I get so aggravated every time it's being wasted on someone. - Well you just don't get it do you? That's what it's supposed to be like but it's not. - So as a result I took him to court, and they awarded me alimony. - That's what he gets. - God damn. - What did you say? - I said God damn. - Look I'd advise you to look straight ahead and mind your own business. - But you're just sitting there bragging about that alimony shit man, pathetic bitch. - You don't even know him, I'm sure if you did you would understand that she deserves every penny. - That's fucked up. - Really, well let's see what your supervisor thinks about this. - I mean that's like paying for a car you can't even drive man. - Just wait I'm sure one day you will be paying someone alimony. - Fuck that, if I send a bitch a check she's gonna send me some pussy in the mail. - Brothers and sisters, I've been noticing a lot of talk going on about our sisters, wearing the contact lenses right. I just wanted to shed a little light on what I think part of the problem is, I call them sassy Susies. She's hanging out by the pool room, over on East Ferry Street. Seems like a likely place to be, when you're out to sell your meat, packaging is so important. Mini skirts and punk high heels, she knows your fantasies by number, the price you pay to make them real. Old Sassy Susie she aint a floosy if you know what I mean. Old Sassy Susie she aint too choosy, you've got to have the grain. A blonde girl died and left her hair so that Susie could have more fun, her neon sign for a good, good time, she knows that she's the one. Her brown eyes turn blue, in an instant anything to please her man. You see she gave up on herself long ago, why can't you understand. It's not a matter of pleasure when Susie is doing that, the pleasure's all yours, it keeps you coming back. So why you picking on Susie, when you ought to smack Jack, life's a bitch and Susie's a fact. - That's right, don't be blaming us, we're only doing what y'all want us to do. - That's right sister. (gun firing) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) - Oh shit, oh God BJ. BJ, don't go out the game, don't go out the game. What about the black man man, don't go out the game. Just please, don't go. (screaming) (crying) * Treat me right, treat me right * * Stop killing one another - [Reporter] In memory of community leader BJ Brown slain by a senseless driveby, this song is for him. (knocking on door) - Come in. - Mr Jackson, I received your memo. - Great. - I'm honored that you think I could handle such a position one day. - Hey you deserve it, you know I can see you being VP of this company one day. - Well is there anything I should be concentrating on? - Well to be honest with you I thought maybe we could go out to dinner, see a show. - Strictly business? - Look baby I'm rich, I can help you get ahead, I just thought we could give it a try. It would be most beneficial to you. - Mr Jackson, I do believe you're stepping well beyond the bounds of professionalism here and I really thought that you knew me better then that. - All I know is this is something I want, so if I were you I would put it in my plans. - Um, Mr Jackson, no disrespect intended, but I'm not interested. - I'm one of the most powerful men around, how in the hell could you not want me? I'll tell you what, you're fired, till you can see things my way. - But Jack. - I'm not joking, get out of here, and don't come back until you're ready. Oh by the way, you can tell whoever you want about this, I'll take care of that too, goodbye Michelle. - I don't believe you, what are you looking for? - Look Brandon is fine, you know he's fine. (laughs) It's just we have different sensitivities. - I don't think you've given it a fair chance. - Yeah, if we had children what kind of values would we teach our children? - Yours, yours and his. - No matter how much he loved me, he could only speculate on my existence as an African American. - You are so confused, you find a man 10 times better then Thomas and you start talking this shit. - Oh now I wouldn't necessarily say that he's better then Thomas, but I will say that he has had all the advantages that this country has to offer. - I don't know what you're hiding, aint nothing back there. - You know BJ may have been a lot of things to a lot of people man, but to me he's my family D. See Thomas man I aint never had no family before, least none that cared man. BJ really cared you know. Now that he's gone nobody cares, just like it was. - You know Spoon we all miss BJ, he was a good man. But you still got family, I'm your family man. I mean I'm here and I care all right. Don't forget that bean head. - All right man. - Why we stopping? - Sharon I thought the way you carried on with Reggie back there was a bit disrespectful. - Don't be jealous over that, he's your friend. - 12 records in a row, I swear if I would have heard Key Sweat Wine one more time I would have taken this pocket book that you left me holding and threw it at that damn DJ. - Oh, he wouldn't stop. Anyway he's the star, I wouldn't subject myself to that kind of life anyway. - Um, I have to make a phone call I'll be right back, I'm gonna use the pay phone over there. - What's wrong with the car phone? - There's nothing wrong with the car phone baby it's just that well you know the guy that I'm gonna call he has one of those cheap cellular phones right and I read somewhere that if you call from your car phone the static could mess up your phone and I don't wanna use this one so don't worry about it, just relax I'll be right back okay.
