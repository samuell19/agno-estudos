WE WENT TO THE THEATER. MONEYPENNY, I'M DEVASTATED. WHAT WOULD I EVER DO WITHOUT YOU? AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER, JAMES, YOU'VE NEVER HAD ME. HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL. THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR COULD QUALIFY AS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. REALLY? WHAT'S THE PENALTY FOR THAT? SOMEDAY YOU HAVE TO MAKE GOOD ON YOUR INNUENDOES. - AFTER YOU, MONEYPENNY. - NO, I INSIST. YOU FIRST. - GOOD EVENING, O07. - TANNER. WHAT'S UP? 16 MINUTES AGO, WE INTERCEPTED A DISTRESS CALL FROM A SUPPOSEDLY ABANDONED RADAR STATION AT SEVERNAYA. LOOK. - WE FOUND A MATCH.

PROCEED WITH YOUR BRIEFING, MR TANNER. THANK YOU. YES, AFTER THE DISTRESS SIGNAL, YOUR HELICOPTER TOOK OFF AND THE RUSSIANS HAD THREE MIGS INTERCEPT IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BASE IS USED FOR? WE SUSPECTED IT MIGHT BE THE GROUND STATION FOR A SECRET SPACE-BASED WEAPON CALLED GOLDENEYE, BUT... OUR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SAW THEY HAD NEITHER THE FINANCE NOR TECHNOLOGY. NUMBERS WERE NEVER MY STRONG SUIT. ARE THESE PICTURES LIVE? UNLIKE THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, WE PREFER NOT TO GET OUR BAD NEWS FROM CNN. NEGATIVE SO FAR. EVERYTHING SEEMS NORMAL.

THE IDEA BEING TO KNOCK OUT THE ENEMY'S COMMUNICATIONS BEFORE THEY CAN RETALIATE. SO, GOLDEN EYE EXISTS. YES. - COULD THIS BE AN ACCIDENT? - NO. THE HELICOPTER. FOR STEALING THE GOLDENEYE, IT WAS THE PERFECT GETAWAY VEHICLE. SETTING OFF THE BLAST WOULD WIPE OUT ANY TRACE OF THE CRIME. - THE JANUS GROUP? - IT MAY BE LINKED TO THE HELICOPTER. I KNOW THE RUSSIAN FAIL-SAFE SYSTEMS. YOU JUST DON'T WALK IN AND ASK FOR THE KEYS TO THE BOMB. YOU NEED THE ACCESS CODES. THERE HAD TO BE AN INSIDER. AT LEAST ONE PERSON PROBABLY KNOWS WHO IT IS. VERY WELL, SIR. THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT. THE PRIME MINISTER'S TALKED TO MOSCOW. IT WAS "AN ACCIDENT ON A TRAINING EXERCISE". GOVERNMENTS CHANGE. THE LIES STAY THE SAME. WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT JANUS? TOP-FLIGHT ARMS DEALERS, HEADQUARTERED IN ST PETERSBURG. RESTOCKED THE IRAQIS DURING THE GULF WAR. THE HEAD MAN'S UNRELIABLY DESCRIBED. NO PHOTOGRAPHS. THE WOMAN, ONATOPP, IS OUR ONLY CONFIRMED CONTACT. - WOULD YOU CARE FOR A DRINK? - THANK YOU. - YOUR PREDECESSOR KEPT SOME COGNAC... - I PREFER BOURBON. - ICE? - YES. WE PULLED THE FILES ON WHOEVER MAY HAVE HAD ACCESS OR AUTHORITY AT SEVERNAYA. THE TOP NAME ON THE LIST'S AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS, I UNDERSTAND. OURUMOV. THEY MADE HIM A GENERAL. HE SEES HIMSELF AS THE NEXT "IRON MAN OF RUSSIA". OUR POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY HE DOESN'T ﬁT THE PROFILE OF A TRAITOR. ARE THESE THE SAME ANALYSTS WHO SAID THAT GOLDENEYE COULDN'T EXIST? WHO SAID THE HELICOPTER POSED NO THREAT AND WASN'T WORTH FOLLOWING? YOU DON'T LIKE ME, BOND. YOU DON'T LIKE MY METHODS. YOU THINK I'M AN ACCOUNTANT, MORE INTERESTED IN NUMBERS THAN YOUR INSTINCTS. - THE THOUGHT HAD OCCURRED TO ME. - GOOD. BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE A SEXIST, MISOGYNIST DINOSAUR, A RELIC OF THE COLD WAR, WHOSE BOYISH CHARMS, THOUGH WASTED ON ME, OBVIOUSLY APPEALED TO THAT YOUNG WOMAN I SENT OUT TO EVALUATE YOU. - POINT TAKEN. - NOT QUITE, O07. IF YOU THINK I DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO SEND A MAN OUT TO DIE, YOUR INSTINCTS ARE DEAD WRONG. I'VE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT SENDING YOU TO YOUR DEATH. BUT I WON'T DO IT ON A WHIM, EVEN WITH YOUR CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARDS LIFE. I WANT YOU TO FIND GOLDENEYE. FIND WHO TOOK IT, WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO WITH IT, AND STOP IT. IF YOU COME ACROSS OURUMOV, GUILTY OR NOT, DON'T RUN OFF ON A VENDETTA. AVENGING ALEC TREVELYAN WILL NOT BRING HIM BACK. - YOU DIDN'T GET HIM KILLED. - NEITHER DID YOU. DON'T MAKE IT PERSONAL. NEVER. BOND... COME BACK ALIVE. GOOD MORNING, GENERAL OURUMOV. DEFENSE MINISTER MISHKIN... GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, DELIVER YOUR REPORT. AS YOU KNOW, 72 HOURS AGO, A SECRET WEAPONS SYSTEM - CODENAME GOLDENEYE - WAS DETONATED OVER SEVERNAYA. AS HEAD OF SPACE DIVISION, I PERSONALLY UNDERTOOK THE INVESTIGATION.

A LEVEL-TWO PROGRAMMER. I WILL INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY.

THEY USED THE CHOPPER TO STEAL A NUCLEAR WEAPON. KILLED A LOT OF INNOCENT RUSSIANS. - WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A COSSACK? - WHO? THIS JANUS - I NEVER MET THE MAN, BUT I KNOW HE'S A LIENZ COSSACK. THE GROUP THAT WORKED FOR THE NAZIS, SECOND WORLD WAR. YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY. AT THE END OF THE WAR, THE LIENZ COSSACKS SURRENDERED TO THE BRITISH IN AUSTRIA, BELIEVING THEY WOULD JOIN THEM AND WAGE WAR AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS. BUT THE BRITISH BETRAYED THEM, SENT THEM BACK TO STALIN, WHO PROMPTLY HAD THEM ALL SHOT. WOMEN, CHILDREN, FAMILIES. NOT EXACTLY OUR ﬁNEST HOUR. STILL, RUTHLESS PEOPLE. THEY GOT WHAT THEY DESERVED.

PARTICULARLY FROM YOU. DID YOU EVER ASK WHY WE TOPPLED ALL THOSE DICTATORS AND REGIMES, ONLY TO COME HOME - "WELL DONE! GOOD JOB, BUT SORRY, OLD BOY." "EVERYTHING YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE FOR HAS CHANGED." - IT WAS THE JOB WE WERE CHOSEN FOR. - OF COURSE YOU'D SAY THAT. JAMES BOND, HER MAJESTY'S LOYAL TERRIER, DEFENDER OF THE SO-CALLED FAITH. OH, PLEASE, JAMES, PUT IT AWAY. IT'S INSULTING TO THINK I HAVEN'T ANTICIPATED YOUR EVERY MOVE. YES. - I TRUSTED YOU, ALEC. - TRUST. WHAT A QUAINT IDEA. HOW DID THE MI6 SCREENING MISS THAT YOUR PARENTS WERE LIENZ COSSACKS? ONCE AGAIN, YOUR FAITH IS MISPLACED. THEY KNEW. WE'RE BOTH ORPHANS, JAMES. BUT WHERE YOUR PARENTS HAD THE LUXURY OF DYING IN A CLIMBING ACCIDENT, MINE SURVIVED THE BRITISH BETRAYAL AND STALIN'S EXECUTION SQUADS. BUT MY FATHER COULDN'T LET HIMSELF OR MY MOTHER LIVE WITH THE SHAME OF IT. MI6 FIGURED I WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER. AND IN ONE OF LIFE'S LITTLE IRONIES, THE SON WENT TO WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT WHOSE BETRAYAL CAUSED THE FATHER TO KILL HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE. HENCE JANUS, THE TWO-FACED ROMAN GOD, COME TO LIFE. IT WASN'T GOD WHO GAVE ME THIS FACE. IT WAS YOU, SETTING THE TIMERS FOR THREE MINUTES INSTEAD OF SIX. - AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOU? - NO. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DIE FOR ME. BY THE WHY I DID THINK OF ASKING YOU TO JOIN MY LITTLE SCHEME, BUT SOMEHOW I KNEW 007'S LOYALTY WAS ALWAYS TO THE MISSION, NEVER TO HIS FRIEND. CLOSING TIME, JAMES. LAST CALL. FOR ENGLAND, JAMES. WAKE UP! MISTER! WAKE UP, PLEASE! WAKE UP! I'M HERE. I'M HERE! HURRY! HURRY UP! COME ON! PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER OR WE'RE GONNA DIE! - DO SOMETHING! GET US OUT OF HERE! - I'M A LITTLE TIED UP! NEVER MIND. THE THINGS WE DO FOR FREQUENT-FLIER MILEAGE. HERE. LET ME HELP YOU. THAT'S IT. MIND YOUR HEAD. LET ME... GO! WHO ARE YOU? - LISTEN.

I'VE NEVER BEEN TO SEVERNAYA. YOUR WATCH HAS. FROZEN BY THE GOLDEN EYE BLAST. AND I'M WILLING TO BET YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CLIMBED UP THE DISH TO GET OUT. - WHO ARE YOU? - I WORK FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. THE MORE YOU TELL ME, THE MORE I CAN HELP YOU. - BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING! - THEN START WITH WHAT YOU DO KNOW. MY NAME IS NATALYA SIMONOVA. I WAS A SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER AT SEVERNAYA FACILITY UNTIL... GO ON. - UNTIL THEY KILLED EVERYONE. - WHO? ALEC TREVELYAN? - NO. I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS. - WHO'S THE INSIDER? WHO'S THE TRAITOR? BORIS.

GOOD MORNING, MR BOND. SIT. I AM DEFENSE MINISTER DIMITRI MISHKIN. SO, BY WHAT MEANS SHALL WE EXECUTE YOU, COMMANDER BOND? WHAT, NO SMALL TALK? NO CHITCHAT? THAT'S THE TROUBLE. NO ONE HAS TIME TO DO A REALLY SINISTER INTERROGATION ANY MORE. - IT'S A LOST ART. - YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR DOESN'T SLAY ME. - WHERE IS THE GOLDEN EYE? - I ASSUMED YOU HAD IT. I HAVE AN ENGLISH SPY, A PROGRAMMER AND A HELICOPTER... - THAT'S HOW YOUR TRAITOR WANTS IT TO LOOK. - WHO ATTACKED SEVERNAYA? - WHO HAD THE CODES? - THE PENALTY FOR TERRORISM IS STILL DEATH. - AND FOR TREASON? - STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU! STOP IT. YOU'RE LIKE... BOYS WITH TOYS. IT WAS OURUMOV. GENERAL OURUMOV SET OFF THE WEAPON. I SAW HIM DO IT. - ARE YOU CERTAIN IT WAS OURUMOV? - YES. HE KILLED EVERYONE, THEN STOLE THE GOLDENEYE. AND WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? THERE IS ANOTHER SATELLITE. ANOTHER GOLDEN EYE. THANK YOU, MISS SIMONOVA. WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT THE LOST ART OF INTERROGATION, MR BOND? DEFENSE MINISTER, I MUST PROTEST. THIS IS MY INVESTIGATION. - YOU ARE OUT OF ORDER. - MOLCHEETYE. MOLCHEECH! FROM WHAT I AM HEARING, IT IS YOU WHO IS OUT OF ORDER. I'VE SEEN THIS GUN IN THE HAND OF OUR ENEMY. - PUT IT DOWN, GENERAL! - DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO THE ENEMY IS? - DO YOU? - GUARD! DEFENSE MINISTER DIMITRI MISHKIN, MURDERED BY BRITISH AGENT JAMES BOND, HIMSELF SHOT WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE. GUARDS! COME ON! THEY'RE IN THE ARCHIVE! DOWN! SPREAD OUT! COVER THE OTHER SIDE! TRUST ME. ARGH! GO NOW! FASTER! DAMN IT. DOWN THE ALLEY! USE THE BUMPER. THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR. NAZAD ! WHAT WAS THAT? GO LEFT! GET OUT! EITHER YOU'VE BROUGHT ME THE PERFECT GIFT, OR YOU'VE MADE ME A VERY UNHAPPY MAN. MISHKIN GOT TO THEM BEFORE I COULD. BOND IS ALIVE? - HE ESCAPED. - GOOD FOR BOND. BAD FOR YOU. TAKE A SEAT, MY DEAR. YOU KNOW, JAMES AND I SHARED EVERYTHING. ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. TO THE VICTOR GO THE SPOILS. YOU'LL LIKE IT WHERE WE'RE GOING. YOU MAY EVEN LEARN TO LIKE ME. - SVINYA! STAY WITH HER. BOND. ONLY BOND. HE'S GOING TO DERAIL US. - FULL SPEED! - SHTO? FULL SPEED! RAM HIM! BYE-BYE. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE A GOOD BOY AND DIE? YOU FIRST. YOU... SECOND. UP! SITUATION ANALYSIS... HOPELESS. YOU HAVE NO BACKUP, NO ESCAPE ROUTE. AND I HAVE THE ONLY BARGAINING CHIP. - WHERE IS SHE? - AH, YES. YOUR FATAL WEAKNESS. OURUMOV, BRING HER IN. LOVELY GIRL. TASTES LIKE... LIKE STRAWBERRIES. - I WOULDN'T KNOW. - I WOULD. SO, BACK WHERE WE STARTED, JAMES. YOUR FRIEND, OR THE MISSION? DROP THE GUN. I'LL LET HER LIVE. OURUMOV... WHAT HAS THIS COSSACK PROMISED YOU? YOU KNEW, DIDN'T YOU? HE'S A LIENZ COSSACK. - IT'S IN THE PAST. - HE'LL BETRAY YOU! JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. - LS THIS TRUE? - WHAT'S TRUE IS THAT IN 48 HOURS, YOU AND I WILL HAVE MORE MONEY THAN GOD AND MR BOND HERE WILL HAVE A SMALL MEMORIAL SERVICE, WITH ONLY MONEYPENNY AND A FEW TEARFUL RESTAURATEURS IN ATTENDANCE. SO, WHAT'S THE CHOICE, JAMES? TWO TARGETS, TIME ENOUGH FOR ONE SHOT. THE GIRL, OR THE MISSION? KILL HER. SHE MEANS NOTHING TO ME. SEE YOU IN HELL, JAMES. - ONE-INCH ARMOUR PLATING. - I'M FINE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! BORIS. YES! - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - BORIS IS ON-LINE BACKING UP HIS FILES. IF I CAN SPIKE HIM, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING. - DON'T STAND THERE! GET US OUT OF HERE! - YES, SIR. GOOD LUCK WITH THE FLOOR, JAMES. I SET THE TIMERS FOR SIX MINUTES - THE SAME SIX MINUTES YOU GAVE ME. IT WAS THE LEAST I COULD DO FOR A FRIEND. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - WE'VE GOT THREE MINUTES. - WHAT ELSE DO YOU CALL YOUR BOTTOM? - WHAT? BORIS' PASSWORD. HE PLAYS WORD GAMES "WHAT I SIT ON BUT DON'T TAKE WITH ME." - CHAIR. - LIKE I SAID... 30 SECONDS. HE'S NOT IN RUSSIA, GERMANY, PARIS, LONDON, MADRID, - 25 SECONDS. - NEW YORK, TORONTO, CHICAGO, - SAN FRANCISCO... - 20 SECONDS! MEXICO CITY, RIO, MIAMI... - COME ON! - WAIT! HE'S IN CUBA. HAVANA - NO. NOW! DO YOU DESTROY EVERY VEHICLE YOU GET INTO? STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. BOYS WITH TOYS. MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE TRANSPORTATION FOR OUR TRIP TO CUBA. OUR TRIP? DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DISARM THE WEAPON? I SUPPOSE THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF WEAPON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DISARMING. SO... TELL ME. ARE THERE ANY OTHER STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES I SHOULD BE AWARE OF, COMMANDER? THOUSANDS. BUT I ONLY PAY THEM LIP SERVICE. MY WHOLE LIFE I DREAMED ABOUT COMING TO THE CARIBBEAN. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. NOT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING IN SIGHT. WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND MOVING VEHICLES? YO, JIMBO! BROUGHT A LITTLE GIFT FROM OLD... WHATSHISNAME? T? Z? _ Q_ - YEAH. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, WADE? - BANYAN TREES. UH... LAM NOT HERE. THE CIA HAS NO KNOWLEDGE, NO INVOLVEMENT. NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR INSERTION INTO CUBA, IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT. MM-HM. YES, I DO. BORROWED THE PLANE FROM A FRIEND IN THE DEA. THE COAST GUARD AND THE FAA ARE IN THE LOOP. YOU'RE CLEARED ON OUR RADAR FOR 0600 HOURS. HERE'S THE LATEST SAT-INT FROM LANGLEY. - STAY BELOW 600 FEET. - 500 FEET. - WHO'S THAT? - NATALYA SIMONOVA. - SIM-YO-NOVA. - RUSSIAN MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION. DID YOU CHECK HER OUT? - HEAD TO TOE. - RIGHT... SO, YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR A DISH THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL ﬁELD, HUH? DOESN'T EXIST. - LIGHT A CIGAR IN CUBA AND WE SEE IT. - I KNOW IT'S THERE. IT'S A DUPLICATE OF SEVERNAYA, LIKE YOUR SECRET TRANSMITTERS IN NEW ZEALAND. I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE. HOW DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT THAT? - WHAT IF I NEED BACKUP? - GET ON THE RADIO. I'LL SEND IN THE MARINES. ANYWAY, HANG A LEFT AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY. - CUBA'S 80 MILES ON YOUR RIGHT. - YO, WADE! JUST ONE THING. DON'T PUSH ANY OF THE BUTTONS ON THAT CAR. - I'M JUST GONNA BOMB AROUND IN IT. - EXACTLY. YO, JAMES. I GOT FAITH, BUT BE CAREFUL. HE KNOWS YOU'RE COMIN'. HE WAS YOUR FRIEND - TREVELYAN. AND NOW HE'S YOUR ENEMY AND YOU WILL KILL HIM. IT IS THAT SIMPLE? IN A WORD, YES. - UNLESS HE KILLS YOU FIRST. - NATALYA... YOU THINK I'M IMPRESSED? WITH YOUR GUNS, YOUR KILLING, YOUR DEATH. FOR WHAT? SO YOU CAN BE A HERO? - ALL THE HEROES I KNOW ARE DEAD. - NATALYA... HOW CAN YOU ACT LIKE THIS? HOW CAN YOU BE SO COLD? IT'S WHAT KEEPS ME ALIVE. NO. IT'S WHAT KEEPS YOU ALONE. JAMES... YES? ON THE TRAIN, WHEN YOU TOLD HIM TO KILL ME AND THAT I MEANT NOTHING TO YOU, DID YOU MEAN IT? YES. ALWAYS CALL THEIR BLUFF. NO. TURN TEN DEGREES SOUTH, BEARING 1-8-4. YES, SIR. NOTHING. THERE IS NOTHING HERE. LET'S MAKE ANOTHER PASS. MAYBE WADE WAS RIGHT. THERE IS NO DISH. NATALYA. THIS TIME, MR BOND, THE PLEASURE WILL BE ALL MINE. YOU WAIT FOR YOUR TURN. SHE ALWAYS DID ENJOY A GOOD SQUEEZE. - LS THE SATELLITE IN RANGE? - SIX MINUTES. - PREPARE THE DISH. - NO. IT'S TOO EARLY. - I AM NOT READY. - DO IT. NO WONDER WE COULDN'T SEE IT. COME ON. THE WORLD'S GREATEST CASH CARD. IT HAD BETTER NOT BE REJECTED. - MISCHA IS ON-LINE. - SIR! KILL HIM. THE MAN JUST WON'T TAKE A HINT. HM! - TARGET COORDINATES? - THE TARGET IS LONDON. HE'S GETTING READY TO SIGNAL THE SATELLITE. - HOW DO YOU STOP IT? - THE TRANSMITTER ABOVE THE ANTENNA. ANTENNA IN POSITION. ON MY COUNT. THREE... TWO... ONE. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. - THE MAINFRAME COMPUTER. - DON'T MOVE. JAMES! WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE. - WE AIM TO PLEASE. - WHERE'S THE GIRL? FIND HER! SO, HOW IS OLD Q? UP TO HIS USUAL TRICKS? THE WATCH. AH. A NEW MODEL. STILL PRESS HERE, DO I? INTERESTING SETUP, ALEC. YOU BREAK INTO THE BANK OF ENGLAND VIA COMPUTER, THEN TRANSFER THE MONEY ELECTRONICALLY JUST SECONDS BEFORE YOU SET OFF THE GOLDENEYE, WHICH ERASES ANY RECORD OF THE TRANSACTIONS. - INGENIOUS. - THANK YOU, JAMES. BUT IT STILL BOILS DOWN TO PETTY THEFT. IN THE END, YOU'RE JUST A BANK ROBBER. NOTHING MORE THAN A COMMON THIEF. YOU ALWAYS DID HAVE A SMALL MIND, JAMES. IT'S NOT JUST ERASING BANK RECORDS. IT'S EVERYTHING ON EVERY COMPUTER IN LONDON. TAX RECORDS, THE STOCK MARKET, CREDIT RATINGS, LAND REGISTRIES, CRIMINAL RECORDS. IN 16 MINUTES AND 43... NO, 42 SECONDS, THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL RE-ENTER THE STONE AGE. A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN. AND ALL SO MAD LITTLE ALEC CAN SETTLE A SCORE WITH THE WORLD 50 YEARS ON. OH, PLEASE, JAMES! SPARE ME THE FREUD. I MIGHT AS WELL ASK YOU IF ALL THE VODKA MARTINIS EVER SILENCE THE SCREAMS OF ALL THE MEN YOU'VE KILLED. OR IF YOU FIND FORGIVENESS IN THE ARMS OF ALL THOSE WILLING WOMEN FOR ALL THE DEAD ONES YOU FAILED TO PROTECT. ENGLAND IS ABOUT TO LEARN THE COST OF BETRAYAL, INFLATION-ADJUSTED FOR 1945. - WELCOME TO THE PARTY, MY DEAR. - NATALYA! DON'T EVER... DO THAT AGAIN. THIS IS NOT ONE OF YOUR GAMES, BORIS. REAL PEOPLE WILL DIE! YOU PATHETIC LITTLE WORM. SHE WAS IN THE MAINFRAME. CHECK THE COMPUTER. SHE'S A MORON. A SECOND-LEVEL PROGRAMMER. SHE WORKS ON THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM. SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE ﬁRING CODES. RETRO-ROCKETS FIRING. - WHAT THE HELL'S HAPPENING? - WE WILL HAVE RE-ENTRY IN... 12 MINUTES. IT WILL BURN UP SOMEWHERE OVER THE ATLANTIC. - DEAL WITH IT! - SHE CHANGED THE ACCESS CODES! THEN SHE CAN FIX IT. GO AHEAD. SHOOT HIM. HE MEANS NOTHING TO ME. I CAN DO IT! I CAN BREAK HER CODES! THEN GET ON WITH IT! TELL HIM! NOW! GIVE ME THE CODES, NATALYA! GIVE THEM TO ME! - CAN BORIS BREAK YOUR CODES? - POSSIBLY. POSSIBLY? WE HAVE TO DESTROY THE TRANSMITTER. BY THE WAY, I'M FINE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! DO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE ONE OF THESE? YES. GOOD. STAY OUT OF SIGHT. - HOW LONG? - TWO MINUTES. - ONE MINUTE. - GUARD! - I'M ﬁXING IT. - IF HE MOVES, KILL HIM. YES! I AM INVINCIBLE. YOU KNOW, JAMES? I WAS ALWAYS BETTER. ALPHA ONE TO GUNSHIP. ALPHA ONE TO GUNSHIP! SPEAK TO ME! FOR ENGLAND, JAMES? NO. FOR ME. AAAAARGHHHHH! AAAAAARGHHHHH! AAAARGHHHHHH! YES! I AM INVINCIBLE! JAMES! JAMES! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, I'M ﬁNE. THANK YOU. SUPPOSE SOMEONE IS WATCHING? THERE'S NO ONE WITHIN 25 MILES, BELIEVE ME. YO, JIMBO! IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR IDEA OF "COMING THROUGH IN A CLINCH"? IT'S TOBACCO PLANTS. I SAID I'D BE HERE, HUH? YO! MARINES! MAYBE YOU TWO'D LIKE TO FINISH DEBRIEFING EACH OTHER AT GUANTANAMO, HM? - READY? - I'M NOT GOING ON A HELICOPTER WITH YOU. NO PLANE, NO TRAIN, NOTHING THAT MOVES.
