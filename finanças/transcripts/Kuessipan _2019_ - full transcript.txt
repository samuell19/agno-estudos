Oops, I dropped one! Say, hello. We'll put them all in here. Mikuan, c'mon. It's our song! Stop! You can't sing! Stop it! Stop or I'll throw a fish at you! I'll throw it, I swear! Everything resists in this moment. Everything opposes common sense. Everything reposes? Ancient souls and families on holiday. I've invented lives. I wanted to see the beauty. I wanted to create it. I wish things were easier to say, to tell, to put down on paper. Expecting nothing? just to be understood. Of course, I've lied, thrown a white sheet over the dirt. Don't go empty-handed. Take at least one bag. Here you are, son. Give us a hand. There, Metshu. OK, Mom. We're going inside. Ouch! Shaniss, time to go home. Can I stay for supper? Can she sleep here? She has to go home. It's enough. Mikuan! Come! Help me. You can go now. Shaniss? Mikuan, we should go. Mikuan, let's go! Mikuan! I see. Is that what you heard? So she's alright? She's not hurt? That's a relief. Thanks for letting me know. Bye. Where is she? They sent her to her aunt in Maliotenam. But she's not at Youth Protection. When will she be back? She'll stay there for a bit. Maliotenam's so far away. Not that far. Only 15 minutes. By car. It's not far away. It's very close. I want to go see her. You will. There's no rush. No, right now. Go to school, now. C'mon. Here, we say nuitsheuan. It means, my friend. But I've called you neshim, like a sister, for I don't remember how long. It seems like forever. Mikuan! Mikuan! Look. Does it hurt? We'll never be apart again, OK? What's that? Just a half. You're totally wired. I saw Josh eyeing you. Ugh! He's such a dork! It's not like there are so many good guys. I'd rather french a cat. We have nothing in common, nothing to talk about. What should I talk about? What can we talk about? So stay all alone and die! Really? Move, I gotta pee. Hold this. You're totally wasted! My love! Ten more! - What's up? - I'm good. Cool. Great vibe tonight. Usually it's non-stop country. Can I get you a drink? Water? Excuse me, madame. I'd like a water and a cranberry-vodka, please. Cranberry-vodka? It's for my bladder infection. I gotta tell you, 'cause it's kinda dumb, but? I lost a bet with my friends over there. So I have to kiss a girl in your gang before the end of the night. What happens if you don't? I gotta pay them $100. But I win $50 if I do. Nice friends you have. Actually they're pretty lame. But, like, it was sort of a joke. Sorry for bothering you. - See you. - Wait. We split the cash? What do you mean? We French and split the cash. - OK. - Deal? Sure thing! So you mean, now? Yeah. What's going on? I'm really sorry, man. Fucking savage! If you can't drink? - A savage? - It was an accident. - Seen a savage who bites? - Lots here. What's with you? Who are you calling a savage? Get the fuck out! Greg? Greg? - You asshole! - Relax, shit. Stop it, fuck. Take it easy. - Let's get Nishkiss. - Forget her. You're not going to party with Shaniss every night. We don't party. You heard me. I get good grades. Gimme a break. Scouts are coming to watch me play. Look at your brother. He's always at practice. I'll find you a job. Doing what? You can help me do beadwork. It's so boring! - Find an activity. - There's nothing at school. That's not true. You could play volleyball. Volleyball? Did you feel that? - Hardly. - Up yours. But the scouts? Aren't you happy? You know that our community has been offered a billion dollars in exchange for unlimited mining rights. What's your view? I'm for. But maybe for $3 billion, not $1 billion. So we can invest in education. Yeah, but the community gets tons of money. Tons. And the poverty's as bad as ever. Think it'll make a difference? Earth is a living creature. The scar will be there forever, showing they exploited our lands, and left us nothing. It'll be one more scar. I'm really against it. For me, our territory is really important. I'd like my kids to know, too, that our territory is important. It would be tough for the elders, losing the land where their grandfathers or mothers lived all their lives. And hunting and fishing are sacred to us. It's our tradition. We don't need to hunt or fish now. Before it was for survival. Today we have supermarkets, clothing stores? Sure we have supermarkets, but the meat is full of chemicals. Full of antibiotics. So you'd give up our entire culture for supermarket food? You say that, but ironically, you love the comfort of your home, your living room, your cozy bed. After six months in the bush, you'd miss all that. I really disagree. With technology today, things have gotten so messed up. Traditionally, you lived on the land. You had fun, you'd hunt moose? when you were hungry? - You had a purpose. - On the move. I think the problem's about finding a balance between the economy and tradition. Japan's managed to keep its traditions alive and at the same time to integrate Western culture into them. So it's a good example. Do you agree to let foreigners exploit our mines? Only if we manage them ourselves. Our territory. We manage it. I'll pass out the application forms and a list of all the colleges in Québec. Highways aren't all the same. Those that head north. Those that go the opposite way. The rutted, dusty ones, on which you have to go slow. Paved roads, with lines that lead you exactly where you want to go. Roads that fall apart, too rarely travelled. - Have a good game. - Enjoy your activity. Is everybody here? I see we have new faces. I'm glad. For our first text, we'll listen to a song. You'll have 15 minutes, to explore where it takes you. It can be prose, a story, poem, whatever you want. OK? So? does a brave soul want to read their text? Yes, Francis? A bird, a vulture high above Floats in the currents of your love The demons laugh, to my chagrin I feed them, take them in Don't all look so glum. The song's deep, so it inspires deep stuff. But it's a good song. Thanks. They were surprised to have a girl from the reserve. Yeah? Were you surprised? Yeah. First time someone's from Uashat. I dunno, it's like they don't mix. Who's they? - The Innu. - With who? Well, with us. The Québecers. I don't mean you're not a Québecer. No, it's just, it seems like they don't mix with us Whites. Yuck. What I said really sucks, huh? I'll start over. It's like they don't mix with, like, us, the? the? the non-Innu. Still not right? I'm teasing you. Good, it was getting rough. Do your poems always rhyme? Well, yeah. I'm writing songs for my future band. And it's better when a song rhymes. Your future band? Yeah. I play the guitar. So I'm missing a bass player, a drummer, and a singer. So at the moment I'm a soloist. Are you on foot? Do you want a lift? Well, yeah. Sure. But I'm going to Malio. OK, and you were going to walk there? I hitch, it works. Have you always lived here? - In Sept-Îles? - Yeah. I grew up here. I live near the old pier, close to Uashat. Hey, I'm really sorry for what happened at the bar. It was really dumb and it's just? I was drunk. Like, really wrecked. And when I'm drunk, like? I get really stupid. I'm sorry. Yeah. And the guy taken away by ambulance? Last I heard, he'd been left paraplegic. What's the music? Want me to put it on? Yeah, sure. It is decreed that from now on, truth is a value It is decreed that from now on, life is a value It's? It's surprising. You expected Kashtin? Why not, they're a good band. Yeah, Kashtin's a good band. It is decreed that the greatest pain has been and always will Being unable to love the person you love Can I send you some songs? I'm sure I have lots that you'd like. - Yeah, great. - OK. You have to give me your number, then. - Thanks! - And my money? - I was serious. - Oh, right. Do you have change? The rest is for gas. Thanks! - My pleasure. - Bye. Go to hell! You useless piece of shit! The baby's healthy, no? So? Her vaccination's important. Don't you get it? You're like a broken record. I stop listening. Where were you all this time? Her diaper needs changing. The clinic called 3 times and he didn't tell me. Gimme a break. The baby's fine. No stress. Where were you? I told you, a writing workshop. School on the weekend? Fuck, the cops! Beat it! Go! Dammit! - What do I do? - Well, open. Hi. We're looking for Greg Mestokosho. - He doesn't live here. - Do you know him? Yeah. He doesn't live here. We're investigating an assault that you witnessed. We heard he does. Whoever told you is wrong. Here's our number. If you hear anything? This is an Indian Reserve. You can't be here. The incident occurred on our territory. Who could've ratted him out? It must be the guy you made out with. Everyone there saw it all. Those cops aren't allowed here. - Yes, they are. - They're not! Think whatever, but they are. Their goddamn investigation! What did you expect? He was dissing us, a lame-ass fighter. That should be illegal! Here's what I'll do. I'll disappear until it blows over. What about me? Alone with Nishkiss? She's a heavy one, my baby! Are you going to charge me for excess weight? Thanks. It's to order from the restaurant. Don't use it to party! What about me? You'll mooch off of them, as usual. Have a good hunt! You'd have to pay me more to kiss one of them. Your opinion. Felt good to me. We can't just go for guys here. On the reserve we have 20, 30 choices. But look further and there are millions. You're too picky. You sure aren't picky if you're with a guy like Greg. It's true that sometimes? he can be intense. Intense? Gimme a break. It's way past intense. It's like he goes rabid. I once saw a rabid squirrel with dad. You scram. A squirrel? Like, a chipmunk? Yeah. I get a bad feeling with Greg. I won't go to my aunt's! I didn't say that. No, I know it sucks at your aunt's. But? you need your own place. You can ask the council. I'm sure my dad'll help you. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. We'll build a house. Right there, on the shore. Just you and me, nobody else. Like, really, really big! Fucking huge! The living room's on your left. with the wood stove in back. Facing the stove, there'll be a sofa. - Leather? - For sure! - A big one? - Real big. You know, the ones that recline. There'll be your room here. And next to it there'll be a playroom. And we'll have a friggin' huge deck. Like, with a jacuzzi. Yeah, totally. She doesn't want me. Here, give her to me. There, there. What's your trick? It's a gift, not a trick. Some people stop nosebleeds. Him, it's babies crying. When you cough you get even more stoned. Did you know I took piano lessons? Piano lessons, you? - Didn't I, Mikuan? - Yeah. Here, I'll lay down a beat. You're really good! He can even play without his hands. How could I fall for it! Defend yourself! It's Francis. Ready for lots of songs? Damn you! Just wait till I slug you! C'mon, try to hit me. Stop! Holy shit! Jesus! Goddammit! It's not funny! Come help. Where you going? Shaniss! Shaniss, it's not funny! I told you to follow me. Wake up! What's all this mess? - It's my fault. I was making fries. - Fries? I told you to order out, not burn down the house! What the hell happened? Clean this up fast. Your dad needs the floor. Good job, Louise! My center of the world lies on a bay. A sandy bay, covered in snow six months a year. The houses are rectangular, with sand at the entrance. The doors are never locked. If you keep going straight, there's the cemetery. Wooden crosses, flowers at their feet. There aren't many. And not because people rarely die. You can't get lost on the reserve. It's too small. Children play unattended. The cars are used to it. They drive slowly. People also walk slowly. If you keep going, you'll see the stadium and its bleachers in faded red paint, invaded by dogs and rain. Things age faster here. Sometimes without anyone noticing. Very good. Very strong. Thank you. Have you been writing long? Yeah, kind of. And what does writing bring you? I don't know. It's just, my way of seeing things, describing them. Bravo. Anyone else want to share their text? The guys are chained in a cave. And all they can see are shadows on the wall. Finally one escapes. He's never been outside before. He's blinded by the sun. But when his eyes adjust, he discovers another reality. What does he discover? He goes back to tell the others what he's seen. But they don't believe him. They can't imagine what he's seen. I dunno if I'm explaining it well. When my teacher tells it, it's way cool. Come look. It's totally sick. Can you hear it? - Yeah. - It makes a buzz. All that noise from something you can't see. It reminds me of the blockade. The blockade? Against the power lines on our territory. The riot squad came. Yeah, when people blocked the road. My dad was there. He even got arrested. Really? My dad bitched about it. That's all I can remember. Did you ever learn why you all ended up on reserves? After owning all this land? Yeah, sure. Didn't you guys? No, just that I could buy you for a musket and two mirrors. Cheapskate. Why? Mirrors were expensive. Do you find the reserve small? For sure. It's like, what? Five streets, max. I used to find it big. But it's become too small. Are there Pokemon on the reserve? Sure. Nice! I have to level up my Gyarados. Go back. More. More. Are you trying to kill me? Real sweet. OK, right there. Lemme see. Cool! The ship's in the background. Nice. I'd like us to correct this SMS. Wher r u? Your late. Well meetup @ the beach. Anyone want to risk it? Yes, Alicia? Beach isn't French. Good, beach is plage in French. Any other errors? What about this question? Wher r u? Is it "Where"? Where are you? - Where? - Are you? Right. Where are you? Next? Well, Well meetup @ the beach? Well takes an apostrophe. We'll meetup. So it's just the apostrophe in We'll? - Yeah. - OK. So what's the verb? To meetup? I meetup, you meetup, he meetups? Kuei, bitch. No, I'm already in my PJs. I'm not up to going out. Mom wants me to help with her beadwork. I know, she's such a pain. A movie? What are you going to watch? You seem in a hurry. I love you, my girl. Aren't you helping me? No, I'm going over to Shaniss's. To watch a movie. These look good on you. They're for your show. No, I made them for you. Try them on. You're so beautiful, baby. Look at yourself. See? They're perfect with your hair. Is that you? Yeah. You had your wisdom teeth removed young. You don't like my cheeks? Your cheeks are beautiful. Have you ever? You? Yeah. But it didn't really count. Why not? Close your eyes. Who's that? Go see. We have a warrant. Let us in. OK, watch her. This way. He's in the bedroom. Tshinashkumitin. (Thanks.) Almost! But say I want to be polite and ask your parents, How's it going? - Really want to know? - Yeah. It's? Ta petshisseshu netshess. A pet shit on my nachos? Call me! - Shaniss. Where are you, fuck? Almost there. When do we escape to New York? I'll follow you anywhere. Even to Quebec City? Yeah, even to Quebec City. Did you lock the door? No, what are you scared of? I dunno. Like, Indian women. When they catch you in their dream catchers? you're trapped for a long time. God you're dumb! Good morning. It's really amazing here. A gift. Happy birthday. Greg got arrested. Oh no. I kept calling and texting you. Where were you? With Francis. - Who's that? - A guy. Yeah, but who? From my workshop. - White? - Yeah, White. Oooh! A white guy! You saw him, at the bar. Don't make that face. Uh, no! The father of my daughter got arrested while you fucked the stool who got him in shit. He didn't jump anyone. "He didn't jump anyone!" That's how you thank Greg for his help? Let's calm down, OK? I don't like you lying to me and your friend. Mom, wipe that stuff off. Don't change the subject. You heard. How can I tell the truth when you react like that? You don't even know him. Hello? What's up, are you OK? OK, yeah. I'm coming. Curfew in your residence from 7 pm to 7 am until your hearing. You are forbidden to contact the victim and to enter a bar, tavern or anywhere alcohol is served. Understood? Yeah. I order your immediate release on your promise to appear. I'm sorry I lied to you. You'll have to accept it. I'm not going to leave Francis. Did you sleep with him? It was amazing. 1, 2? A little jab. Yes, sweetheart. It's all done. It'll bleed a bit, but that's normal. A band aid and it'll be all over. Yes, sweetie. There, the worst is over. The Maliotenam Mikuns penetrate their opponent's zone. But the defense immediately regains possession. No. 24 of the Sept-Îles Basques again goes on the attack. Metshu, slash him in the knees, shit! Come on, get going! 3, 2, 1! Wanna get a picture? Shaniss, Francis! Yeah, you bet. I always go all out. Is there more? It's my dream to play for Baie-Comeau. I won't disappoint you! OK, thanks. Thanks, bye. Careful of my beads! Yay! Baie-Comeau! He thinks, "Not another one!" He says, "Madame, come here." "Yes, father?" "Take $300 from the collection box and buy yourself a lawnmower!" He's told it 200 times! Did you get it? Course, I got it! - Francis is learning words in Innu. - Yeah! Go easy on me, but yeah, what I learned is? "I have a little penis." Why? What does it mean? Christ! I have something to tell you. I'm going to college in Quebec City next year, and Francis is coming. Who's going to pay? What do you mean? You help Metshu, but for me, no way? With Metshu, it's for hockey. And me, just for school. I'm glad you told me! We just decided. You're putting ideas in her head. No but? It wasn't like? I thought you'd be glad! I wish you'd asked us. Hey, I think it's cool. Ask you? What's the point? Nobody here really knows me. Francis knows me better than you. He knows you better than us? What a joke! Madame hangs out with kakusheshet. We're not good enough. Shut up! You're racist! You hear? You're racist! Being proud isn't racist. It's not that! They want our land and I'm racist? Francis isn't taking anything. You have no pride. If everybody was like you, we wouldn't exist. But you? It doesn't seem to bother you! Careful! In the city, it's easier to be no one. All the people you see know nothing about you. They look right through you, their minds elsewhere. The city stops where the reserve starts. The fence planted there, keeping the wolves at bay. People search for a way out, find the path of their own laws. They want to escape where there is no barricade. C'mon. That wasn't a deke, you cheated. It went in. C'mon, I didn't have to reach. Dumb luck. C'mon, again! You think too much. You don't think enough. You should call her. You're too proud. It's not up to me to apologize. We'll wash her tummy here. And let it dry. Meanwhile we get the needle. We put this here. And now? Ouch! Then you remove the needle and put it in the yellow jar. Easy, huh? Can you do it by yourself? Mikuan, you're off to Quebec City? I'm going with Francis. Shaniss isn't here? She was busy. Too bad, I wanted to see her little girl. You'll burst Nishkiss's eardrums. Don't go crazy. Calm down. Leave it alone! You've played that track six times. I can't take it! Hands off, Shaniss! Goddamnit! Shit! I told you not to touch it! What's this for? To turn it on. Does it make a real flame? Yeah, if you plug it in. If you put it on the heater, it'll make flames! Don't lose the remote. Ask the white boy, he must know how to use it. Leave him alone. Stop making fun of him! - Afraid we're laughing at you? - Kind of. You catch on fast! Thanks! Try it on. Looks like a lollipop! Now G. Then you start the chorus. No, hold it. There's a flat. Richard Séguin? Dig in! Did Greg do that? I'll go see him. No, get off me, Dad. I have to go. Get off! I have to do this! Metshu, come back here! I always push his buttons. Don't say that. It's not your fault. I know it's not my fault. But still, I went too far. I should've backed off. I missed you. I missed you too. I can't believe we weren't talking. Y'know, at Greg's, when I was all alone, I thought of you. Because it's you who's always there when it's tough. I'm with you. Sorry, but your Freezie's dripping down my back. Sorry. It's OK. My son! The silence. I'd like to write the silence. I detest the faces of the dead. Their look of serenity, their closed eyes. The absurdity of cold skin painted in sad colors. The wrinkles they no longer have. The departed soul taking with it all existence in one breath. I want his mouth, forever mute, to tell me that I look like him. I don't know why I never cry. Wait! No way I can sleep tonight. Do you think things happen by chance? Or are they decided by a kind of force, like God? I think when it's your time, it's your time. Would he have died if he hadn't gone to see Greg? Do you think it's my fault? Of course not. I just wonder, is it worth pushing yourself to do things if everything's predetermined and you can't change anything? We're taking Shaniss's things. You too? I'm here to help them. And Nishkiss? Is she OK? What's the rush? Have a drink. Let's talk. We're not in the mood. Lots of that stuff's mine. Like what? The kid's. I paid for it. Exactly, belongs to the kid. What I mean is, I paid. You know what I mean. You never see my good side. My love? you know I'm sorry for what I did. It won't happen again. I'm sorry. I learned my lesson. Come back. Here. Mikuan? I wanted to go to your brother's funeral. But I? You were right not to come. These things happen. Take care of yourself. So this is your room. Smoking's not allowed. We're strict about that. I'll let you settle in. Thanks. I can't stay here. It's way too small. Bigger than Greg's place. I mean, the room. It's fine, plus there's the TV room. I don't belong here. They're all abused women. It's depressing. Sure I can't stay with you till I find a place? My parents need peace and quiet. I'd like that, but? Y'know. Sometimes I feel we're already old. Want me to come to the police station? - No? - I'm not pressing charges. I can't, it'd be too mean. His trial's soon. He'd be up shit creek. He beat you up and you'll let him off? I don't trust the cops and everyone. Do you want him to go to jail? My daughter's dad would be a criminal. Jail or not, he is a criminal. Greg's my sole family. You have me. Yeah, but you're leaving. I just said what I think. What I think is, my daughter needs her father. Go back to Greg and you'll end up like your mom. That's enough! You've changed, Mikuan. Not the others? You! Think you're better than me? Than everyone? Think that if you study in Quebec City, your life will be, wow, sublime? No, that's not real life. It's not 'cause I dropped out that you're smarter than me. Stop making decisions for me. I'm sick of it! Your life is as shitty as everyone's here. OK, that's enough. Good, leave! I don't need you. I dreamed of my grandfather. He took me to hunt hares. We were in the bush, setting snares. Suddenly, I lost sight of him. I was caught in a storm. Mikuan! You were home? What's wrong? I have to talk to you. Go ahead, talk. Look, it's not your fault. It's me, but? It's over. What's over? Well? It's not your fault. But after everything that's happened, like? It got me thinking about everything and? Christ, it's so intense. You're pulling this? - Well? - You're pulling this now? Well, there's never a good time. Would you prefer me to wait and pretend? Pretend? Were you pretending? Were you pretending? That's not what I said. I was never pretending. It happened so quickly. We come from two totally different worlds. - I don't know what to say. - For me too. I have to adapt too. It's new for me too. I tried. But I realize it's not that simple. And again, it's not about you. You're an amazing girl, even? Then what is it? Is it my family? - What? - My friends? That's what I'm saying. Everyone's great. It's me. I don't want to go to Quebec City. I like it here. I'm ill at ease. I feel like I don't belong, like I'm an impostor. Me too? I wish it were simple. But it's not simple. Christ! C'mon! Mikuan! Mikuan! Everyone's looking for you! Go away, leave me alone! Are you crazy? Are you going to shoot me? I don't need you either! Put that down. You know I didn't mean what I said. I'm sorry! Is it Francis? I knew it! Don't say that. You can't trust 'em, they? Shut up! Just shut up. I just want to wake up. I miss my brother. Don't worry. We'll build a house. Together. I'm here. I'll look after you. I'll never abandon you, I promise. We have to stay together. That's good. Good work. Did you buy groceries? What's this. What's what? Put it back. You haven't had a drop in 20 years. - Hello. - Hi. - Your name? - Mikuan Vollant. Perfect. Good luck. Seeing freedom as a right is a force for social change. At its best, it helps humanity to advance. Thus, we are free, each in our own space, as long as your freedom ends where mine begins. Thank you. Our next contestant, Mikuan Vollant. In my mother tongue, the word freedom in its broader sense doesn't exist. There were no limits. There never were. Perhaps one must first know captivity to conceive what freedom is. I search for a word that comes close. Perhaps nutshimit. Nutshimit is the land, the land of our ancestors. Nutshimit is peace. The silence of the stream following its path, hidden under a meter of snow. Nutshimit is not a place. It's the vastness. The reserve is a place. I hate that word. But since it exists, we must name it. I think it's possible, without our realizing, that the place where we live rubs off on us. To believe those who tell us who we are. To embrace a life of limited ambition. And meekly accept that we are born without promise. Pride is not a repressed emotion or feathers worn in our hair or beads sewn on my jacket. Pride is something you build. To stand up straight, you must believe in your legitimacy. And thus, perhaps, you can begin to conceive what freedom is. You who understand what I am saying, I want you to know that my pride is us. Like you, I am Innu. For if my feet are drawn down new paths, if my eyes tirelessly scan the horizon, I will always know where my heart is rooted. That, perhaps, is part of what freedom is. Thank you. Come to Daddy. You're taking so much stuff! Yeah. I thought you'd left. All that packing took a long time. You look beautiful. Thanks. What'd you do last night? Not much. We watched a movie. I can't remember the title. Y'know, with what's-his-face. What's-his-face? I'm a bit stressed. Y'know, with school and? Everything. You shouldn't stress out. It'll be fine. You're good at it. Well, I guess I better go. OK. If I want to get there. Lemme know how it goes. Promise to take care of yourself. I invented lives. The man with the drum never told me his story. I embroidered from his rough hands and his bent back. And those other lives? I embellished them. I wanted to see the beauty. I wanted to create it. I'd like you to know her, the girl with the round belly. Let's go inside, Nishkiss. I'd like you to know her, the girl with the round belly. Who will raise her children alone and scream at her cheating boyfriend. Who'll change diapers all her life. The girl who'll get a job at age 30. Who'll finish high school at 35. Who'll start to live when fear leaves her, relieved to finally be herself. She wants only, like everyone else, to have children, a way of strengthening a race people tried so hard to destroy. Like a passion to live or to stop dying. Do you see this gaze, blazing from inside? Indian women who've seen everything, and are surprised they laugh so often.
