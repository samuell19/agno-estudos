For Werner Bergmann Long, long ago... Three weeks ago. Berlin - Spring 1990 That's me - Niyazi. ''Work is the salt of life,'' my grandma used to say to me. Oh well... I actually like cooking, especially Turkish pizza. But in this city, I haven't had the chance to make one in ages. I'd have left this place a long time ago if I'd known about another way of earning some damn money! -Offline? -Offline. It's high time to pack up my things now that life here isn't getting any easier for someone like me. Shortcut to Istanbul Based on material from the story ''Romeo'' by Jurek Becker I had actually intended to go to the East, albeit much later - in a big car. When the enormous rent for my tiny room kept going up, though, I was ready to leave. A friend of mine gave me the idea. If it worked, I'd be all set. Then I could return home in 2 years instead of 3 - and where else do you get a year as a present? It's like this: For one West German mark, you get a lot of East German marks. So you could live in East Berlin and work in West Berlin - and get paid in the better currency. It's forbidden, of course. And you can't have your own apartment in the East. But only millionaires can afford a clean conscience anyway. All you need is a girl with a room and you're a rich man. All the seasons are the same in this city. You hardly notice any difference between them. No wonder all the people here look so grey and serious! The sun is probably shining at home. A friend of my friend wanted to introduce me to her friend. No harm in looking, she said. I had decided to come across very cool. -Hello. -Hello. This is Klara. I'm Niyazi. Excuse me you two, but I've got to go. Bye. Bye. You have pretty eyes. -Were you waiting a long time? -No. Miserable weather for a date, isn't it? Can I try? Any idea where we could go? Of course, I hoped she'd invite me over to her apartment. I mean, we couldn't stand in the rain forever. Could we go somewhere more comfortable than here? We can probably get a seat in the hotel restaurant. Good afternoon. A menu for the lady and one for her friend. Don't worry about the price. She read the menu for ages and then ordered some ice cream. I didn't mind. I wanted to save money, after all. I ordered a glass of wine - to lower my inhibitions. Klara is a pretty name. Sure. In our village, there's a woman who tells your fortune. She reads your palm. Once she told my sister she would have an accident and 2 days later, a bucket fell and hit her on the head. She had a... What do you call it? A concussion? -What was it again? -A concuss... Right, a concussion. And once she told me that I'd make a lot of money abroad and find myself a beautiful wife. The woman was right. Has anyone ever told you your fortune? Now let's see... Your lifeline is very long and simple. And quite a number of children - 4 of them. Do you have children? No, I'm on my own. You've got your own apartment? Well, the children will come with time. You'll see. Lucky in love - that's very clear. Oh yes... ...that would be me. You can't read my hand at all. Of course I can! -I also saw where you work. -What? Sure I did! Now that would be a surprise. You work... Let me look again. You work... ...at a hospital. -Kerstin told you that. -I swear! Is the job alright? Too much work, not enough money, 3 shifts. You probably have a more exciting life. What's is like over there? You can see for yourself. I mean, in Turkey. Oh, you mean at home! Wait a second. This is my mother, my father, my sister and my brother. This was during a boat trip in Istanbul. Blue sea and blue sky - so different from here. And this is the town of Fetje, where we come from originally. It must be beautiful there. Sometimes. -In a nice house near the sea. -It cost 30,000 marks. That's a lot of money. My parents earned it by working in Germany for 17 years. 17 years. -You want to stay that long too? -Absolutely not. That's...just a hobby of mine. Hey, don't go! That wasn't supposed to happen. It took her quite some time to calm down again. She said males are all the same; they just want one thing. ''No reason to panic,'' I thought, but her room was a long way off. My grandma used to say: ''When you cross a bridge with a bear you should call him brother.'' Her plans had changed now, and I had to follow the rules of her game. The Old Guardhouse. Is this your first time here? There's more going on in your Berlin on a Saturday. Not so boring... ...and more colorful. I don't mind the peace and quiet here. That's odd. That's the Opera House. My left foot was hurting. A box had fallen on it 2 days earlier. I couldn't walk around all day. And that wasn't what I had come for anyway. That much was clear. What do you usually do on weekends? Nothing special. When I don't have to go to work... ...I clean. Sometimes I go out with my girlfriends. We've also been over there... ...but it's no fun without any money. You feel like a beggar there. You walk through the department stores, but you can't buy anything. Actually, I didn't quite understand her. I thought: ''If she's got such a big problem with money, why doesn't she invite me over to her apartment?'' They're showing a murder mystery, I think. My German isn't good enough for films. I never get the jokes. Your German is very good for a foreigner. Could you say something in Turkish? What should I say? I don't know. Whatever you want. But what? I can't think of anything. Say anything. Do you have a boyfriend? I mean, since you're so pretty... I've had a few... ...but only two serious ones. One of them suddenly dumped me. I don't really know why. The other one I dumped myself. Oh well. And I'm not pretty. I was getting tired of this and asked myself if I wouldn't rather deal with someone more like a prostitute, like Klara's friend, for example. There were advantages and disadvantages either way. But comparing women like this is pretty stupid because there may always be a better one out there. We could go back to my place, if you'd like. Well, if you don't mind! But I only have syrup at home. I mean, if you wanted wine or schnaps. It was the only shop that was open on a Saturday. Unfortunately, they only accepted West German money, as Klara had said. That was very annoying. Would you like to have this? Why did so little cloth cost so much? But, as they say at home, saving your seeds means losing at harvest time. Hopefully, the apartment would be alright and not too far from the border. Otherwise, the whole thing would be pointless. Well, at least the building looked very promising. Those old buildings usually had spacious apartments. Here we are. I'll put the wine in the fridge. The apartment is beautiful. You're lucky to have an apartment at all. Expensive? 28 marks... ...not including utilities. That's nothing. -Know what we pay over there? -I know? I knew I'd get too shy if I waited for too long. I knew that from previous experience. When she let me kiss her, I thought: ''Well at least that's been sorted out.'' There are usually some good shows on Saturday. -Thanks. -What should we toast to? To freedom. Do you like him too? -Do you like him too? -Yes. -Could you get me his record? -Of course! What's his name? I'll write it down for you. And instead of starting with ''By the Well, '' you will hear ''In the Well before the Gate." Ladies and Gentlemen, the Frankfurt Underwater Brass Band. ''If God gives you a wife, then he'll also give you patience,'' they say at home. But God hadn't given me a lot of patience. I needed to find out at least if I could leave all the money here that I had exchanged. I thought: ''If she just watches TV the whole time, I will never be the wiser.'' Don't touch it. It's okay as it is. I had never made love with the TV on. That's because I don't own one. It's disturbing because you always want to hear a few words, or you'll think about who the singer reminds you of. I once had a fling with this girl who used to wind up her wrist- watch while making love. I had my revenge, but I don't want to say how. Should I leave? If you'd show me how much you enjoy it, then you'd enjoy it more. Do you have LOTTO in East Berlin? Of course we have LOTTO. We've got it in West Berlin too. I play it regularly there. For 4 marks per week. And always the same numbers. I won 9 marks and 90 cents on my very first time. But nothing else ever since. Then you're losing over 200 West marks a year. Can't you do anything better with that money? With 4 marks a week? No. There isn't a better option. The prospects of becoming rich are very small indeed, but if I didn't gamble, my chances of becoming rich would be much, much smaller. You can never be rich enough. For me, hope is worth 4 marks. Oh well. It's your money. Do you know what? I'll write down my numbers that I play in West Berlin for you, and then you can play them here for me. Every week. OK? I'll make us something to eat. Klara seemed to have changed somehow. Maybe it was because of the blouse she now wore. I tried to imagine our relationship as one that had nothing to do with one Berlin or the other, with the different currencies, where I was simply a young man and she'd be my girl. You look really great right now. I mean, even better than before. What about that envelope? I'd like to leave it here. Until next time. It'd be stupid to keep carrying this forbidden money back and forth across the border. Did you count it? Of course. I'm on the night shift this coming week. I've got to work tomorrow too. You still need to give me the numbers. What numbers? Oh, right! Are you coming next week? Saturday? I'll be on duty the weekend after next. That's a long way off. I felt it was too early to talk about my housing problem during that first night. My grandma used to say: ''If you want your ox to pull your plow a little longer, then you'll have to wait for its leather.'' My boss is very strict about working hours. You can't punch your card when you show up, but only when you're changed and ready for work. It's the same after work: first you punch your card, then you change. Your time is stolen twice. I'd have quit by now, if only I knew how to earn some damn money another way. But at this rate, I'll never be a rich man. Subtitles by Evan Torner ©2007.
