HADJI MURAD, THE WHITE DEVIL AKA THE WHITE WARRIOR In 1850, under Tsar Nicolas the 1st, the Mad, the fierce people of the Caucasus, barricaded themselves in the mountains, around King Shamil, fighting for liberty and independence against the brutality of the Russian troops occupying the region. The Russians! The Russians! The Russ…! The Russians! The Russians! The Russians! Let go of me! These are the tactics we plan to follow. Now, if your Majesty will put 2 more regiments at our disposal, we'll finally have the opportunity to organize a mass attack. Our strategy… - Strategy? Tactics? Attack? And now you want 2 more regiments! 2 regiments! You talk as if this were some game! You're like children who amuse themselves playing soldier! If Vorontzov is an idiot, you're not any better! Your plans are certainly equally disastrous! That a few ragtag mountaineers could stalemate an entire army! Incredible! You get medals and it's me who pay for them! They cost me millions, these decorations! This one: 7 million rubles! And this one: 10 million rubles! I'm tired of it. From this moment on, I act alone. Everything that concerns this campaign will be under my direct supervision! Understand? And I give you my guarantee that this war will end quickly! What do you want? Get out! Forgive me, Your Majesty. Princess Maria has arrived. Now take back your trinkets. Whatever they're worth. And now, get out! Ah, the princess. I'm coming at once. Go before me. Your Majesty. How do you do, Maria Grabilievna? You always wear an enchanting perfume. French, is it not? It's a terrible pity that you're my goddaughter. You inspire me with feelings of quite a different kind. Please, sit. I have something to tell you, Maria Grabilievna. It concerns your husband. Why? Has anything happened? He's an idiot, Maria. I thought it was something serious. Well, you see, Your Majesty, Sergei is certainly far from brilliant but… I'm delighted that you agree, Maria. In that case, you won't be surprised when I tell you of my decision. I think that you'd be convinced too that I had no other choice. It's the order which would relieve him of his command. You see, Maria, your husband has many enemies and up to now, he's led the campaign in a way that is hardly satisfactory. He hasn't made any progress in the war against the rebels. He only knows how to ask for money and soldiers! Always soldiers and money! But your husband has one saving grace that makes him dear to my heart: his perfectly enchanting wife. Your Majesty… …is too kind. - I can easily be much more, Maria Grabilievna. I don't think your Majesty could be any kinder. A father couldn't do more! You see, I really should submit your husband to an inquiry. Instead, I'm giving him the opportunity to reestablish himself. Would you be willing to leave St Petersburg tomorrow morning in order to join him at the front? If Your Majesty wishes it. Very well. Now listen to me, Maria. You are to give him this. It is my personally written authorization to negotiate with the enemy. It shouldn't be difficult. I'm sure the rebels are tired of this war too which has dragged on for years. They're bound to come to terms! King Shamil is old. The Caucasian tribes have elected new chiefs, young and ambitious men who will gladly ally themselves with us if we offer them position and honors. Those things exert an enormous attraction upon people who live in those desolate mountains and which cost absolutely nothing. We just need to find one and all the rest will follow him. You understand my plan? And Your Majesty has already made his choice, I imagine. You're a very clever girl. I wish your husband was like you. Have you ever heard of the "White Devil"? No. No, Your Majesty. I find the name a bit melodramatic. - His real name is Hadji Murad. Unfortunately, he has given us much trouble in these last 3 years. He is the youngest of the Caucasian tribal chiefs and his people consider him an invincible hero. Negotiate with him and the war is over! I'm certain Sergei will do his very best, Your Majesty. Yes. But I expect a good deal more than his best. That's the reason, I'm sending you. As you see, Maria, I have great faith in you. Thank you. And I will try to be worthy of it, Your Majesty. And when it's all over, I will anxiously await your triumphal return to St Petersburg. Giddy up! Giddy up! Are you worried, Princess? Why on earth should I be? Don't you fear the rebels? You forget, Louise, we have an escort of Uhlans. I don't believe there's anything that could stop Hadji Murad. The White Devil? You know his nickname? His fame has spread all the way to court. It seems that he's truly an extraordinary man. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't mind meeting him face to face. Holy Virgin, protect us! The rebels! The rebels! Holy Virgin, Holy Jesus protect us! Stop it! What an exhibition! Will you stop? Ah, ladies! Real ladies! Please, come out. This I will help myself to. What are you doing? Give me that. Sorry, my lady. This is not what we want. I don't understand. Don't you want to rob us? Our baggage is up there. Take it and let us go! Keep your luggage. We wouldn't have disturbed you, if it weren't for your escort. They aroused our suspicions. We're not robbers. I'm sorry about him too. But your people and my people are at war. War? You are rebels against the Tsar. I'd like to know how you dare place yourselves upon the same level as Russian soldiers? You're absolutely right. We're not upon the same level. We only kill soldiers. They kill women and children. There's a great difference. Let's go, boys. Sit! Sit! Stand! A carriage has entered the park. - Good. Come! Let's go. Bring up the luggage immediately! My sweet dear, this is madness. Such a long journey. You must be very tired. But I'm flattered by it: Your desire to be by my side. Oh, Excellency! Such an exciting journey! - See to the luggage, Louisa. There was an excellent reason, Sergei. A reason? The Tsar. Long live Hadji Murad! Long live Hadji Murad! See, the hero returns to us once again. One might say he's a very lucky man, as nothing is impossible for him. The people are all with him. At least, until the day comes when Allah grows tired of smiling upon him. I bid you welcome, Hadji Murad. We are all happy to have you among us again, safe and sound. You were the only chief missing from our assembly. I was lucky, King Shamil. We've had several skirmishes with the Russians. And we've taken much booty. I brought you a gift. This Russian Sabre. As you see, the others are here: Asman Yamouti with his riders and Ibrahim Bey, the Sultan of Riab with his men. And even Akmet Khan with his tribes. Come. The other chiefs await us. The Terek River flows through here. If we could only use it for navigation, it would be the best route to reach the valley. But now it's impassable. The fort of Tabarasan has blockaded the river with its heavy artillery. It is the key to the entire valley. If we could silence the mouths of those cannon, they couldn't impede our march anymore. It is here, we must concentrate our forces. With a long and unrelenting siege, Tabarasan will finally have to capitulate. Great Shamil, it would be madness to try to overcome the resistance of that fortress. We've already lost many men in our attempts to assault it. Nevertheless, if Tabarasan were ours, the Black Mountains would be impregnable. We must make another attempt. That fortress is a trap! Nobody has the right to risk our men's lives in such a futile attempt! You may win further glory, Hadji Murad but how many lives will it cost us? How dare you insult him? Why this hostility? Hadji Murad is right. He has always risked his own life 10 times over before he would expose any of his soldiers to danger. I believe he has a plan in mind. I do. But I won't discuss it. I'll act alone, as usual. If we give up the attack on Tabarasan, we must give up the Black Mountains. The Russians will occupy them and before long, they will be defended by Russian forts. King Shamil, let me remind you of something. He who holds the Black Mountains is the master of the Caucasus. That's why I risk the lives of my men and myself to take that fort. Forgive me, noble Hadji Murad. Your courage and unbounded generosity transform all our apprehensions into admiration for your boldness and spirit of self sacrifice. Keep your plan a secret, by all means. I'm certain that you'll triumph. Let me embrace you in all our name. I'm going to Makete and the other villages. We need men. You mustn't be so imprudent, Hadji Murad. The Russians are everywhere, you know. Be careful, don't expose yourself overmuch. It will be a dangerous undertaking. - Tabarasan is a deadly trap. A deadly trap for who falls into it. Who outside of it, must be wise. We'll circle them from afar before springing the trap. It will be a fine surprise. How we'll laugh. You do very well not to reveal our plan. We'll see each other tomorrow with all the men. You come with me. Hadji Murad! Hadji Murad! We'd heard that you'd returned! We didn't expect you here so soon. Aslan Bey! Aslan Bey! Master! Master! Hadji Murad has come. Hadji Murad? Hadji Murad! Glory of our people! Why did you come here in secret? We had planned to give you a grand reception. But for tomorrow. - I'll be far away tomorrow. And I need your help. Go! Go to the other room. More soldiers? You guessed it. That shouldn't be too difficult. But I must make a complaint: War! War! War! You think of nothing else. You must cease and think about marriage. Your son needs a mother. How is Yusuf? Yusuf? He's in the best of health. You need not worry about him. I've had 19 children with my 4 wives but I've never seen such a little devil! May Allah bless him! Hey, ladies! Don't you see we have a guest? - Papa! I'm glad you're here. I was sure you'd come this evening. I even told the others but they wouldn't believe me. Ladies, see? He came to see me tonight! Hey, kids! How many have you killed today? With this sword, I can't kill anybody. How can I? With an old piece of wood, you can't do anything. I'll give you a real sword tomorrow. And I give you permission to kill a couple of my wives. Then I'll be able to marry more and then we'll be very happy. Papa, take me with you. You're too little. But when I grow up, can I go with you to kill Russians? By the time you're big enough, I think the war will be over. At least, I hope so. - Oh, no. It can't be. Because I know if I wanted to, I could be a good warrior even now. Only she won't let me do it. Yusuf, it's time to go to bed. Come, do as I say. What did I tell you? She treats me as though I were still a baby. Sultanet is a mother to perfection. She'll watch your rascal and if you marry her and get her out of my hair, she'll give you more children and mother them also. She is strong and a fine housekeeper. She's not like these good for nothings that I married! Are you offended by what your father said? No. I'm used to his ways. To him, women are worth less than beasts. He's no different from all the other men. All other men? Including me? You know I love you. Must I repeat it? You love me for 5 minutes when you come to see my father and meet me by chance. Then you go away for months. And you forget all about me. I'm tired of waiting and thinking about you, while you are far away. You won't wait much longer. I promise. You keep me quiet with promises so I won't annoy you. But you don't care about my feelings! Are you convinced of that? Why don't you take me with you? My younger sister got married the other day. The man she loved carried her off instead of bartering for her, as they all do. And she's happy and satisfied. I couldn't stand to be traded for cattle. And someone has unfortunately already made an offer to my father. Akmet Khan? -Yes. My father knows I don't love him. But he's tempted by his good offer. That's another reason why I'm mad at you for making me wait so long. I'd rather be an old maid all my life than marry that man. I'll carry you off too, Sultanet, according to our customs. I only wish it were true. But you're going away again soon. But I'll come back. I'll marry you and carry you away with me. Forever. Your beauty outshines the splendor of the rising sun. If I frightened you, forgive me. What? You're blushing? That's very flattering. May I understand that my presence has finally made your little heart beat faster? No. Let me go. I'm a powerful chief but before you, I'm as awkward as a school boy. And you amuse yourself by torturing me. - Goodbye, Chief. I'm thirsty. Give me a drink. Would you deny me a little water from your pitcher? No! No! No! Always thinking of your hero, right? I've known about it for a good while. But you'll forget him very soon. I give you my guarantee. What do you mean by that? You'll wait for him a long time. Why are they waiting so long to give the signal? I'm worried. The nitroglycerin could explode in their hands. There's the signal! The alarm! The alarm! They're anxious to be slaughtered. - We'll receive them as they deserve. They're insane to defy our artillery. Let them approach even closer. - Yes, Captain. Prepare to open fire. Fire! Fire! Fire! Watch out, It's blowing up! Now to them! Get down, dogs! On your knees! This is a joyful day. Forget hatred. I promised to spare their lives. Forward! Get going! Get going! Sultanet! Go tell your father that Hadji Murad will be visiting your house tonight and that he's bringing with him 3 magnificent lambs for the banquet. If you knew how long I've waited for this moment. It seems like a dream. You can do it! You'll be splendid. How lovely you are, Sultanet! I wish someone like Hadji Murad would come and carry me off. All the girls in the village will die of envy! I can't wait to see you dressed! - Oh, how lovely! My daughter! Well, now you won't be able to say that I treat you badly, my beloved. If you knew how much this magnificent gown alone cost me, you'd never call me stingy again. However, I can say that giving my daughter to marry Hadji Murad is an honor to my house. Tonight, as you know, there'll be a feast in celebration of his victory. What do you want? Hadji Murad's servant has just arrived with 3 lambs for the feast. Run! Hurry! Run to the kitchen! The dinner is not yet ready and the table hasn't even been set! I won't permit shame to fall on my house when the guest arrive! Look at yourself. Look how pretty. Here comes Hadji Murad! - Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Hadji Murad! You can do it! Hurry! Throw him to the ground! What will they do to us, Sir? Don't worry. We have the word of Hadji Murad that we'll be spared. Death to them! Death! Death to them! Death! Let's go, my fine gentlemen! On your feet! Whip the horses! Death to them! Death! You were splendid, Hadji Murad. Justice has been done! Here are those murdering dogs, Hadji Murad. We've carried out justice. Who's responsible for this? Who gave the order? It was the will of the people. -So it was you? What does it matter who gave it? You seem to forget Russians are our enemies who murdered our wives and children! Because of you, I'm a chief without honor! You have thrown mud upon our victory! Have you two lost your minds? I demand justice, Shamil. I won't go back on my word. Since when did become so tenderhearted to the Russians? Perhaps they've begun to sell you those victories of yours at a good price! I await your word, Shamil. If you don't respect your allies, there's no justice or honor in you. Is my loyalty to be repaid with the slaughter of my prisoners? Your prisoners? Who is king here? You or Shamil? You're getting old, Shamil. Your judgment is weakening if it supports a scoundrel like him! You dare insult me like this before my people? I've always loved you as a son. You've forgotten respect you owe me. I must have a sign of repentance and of submission from you. Only then will I become again a father and a friend. There's no justice here. He among you who is still faithful, follow me. Hadji Murad! Hadji Murad! - What are you doing? Sit down! Hadji Murad. My dear, old friend. What a terrible thing. What a disaster for our country! They just told me and on this day when everything was ready. And now, naturally, we've had to cancel everything. My poor girl isn't one to… If you could only see her! I've come to get Sultanet as I promised. You mean, despite everything, you still want to marry her and take her with you? Are you sad? Not anymore. I've forgotten Shamil, Akmet Khan and everything else. I've never been so happy. But will you be happy with me? I have no friends. My future is uncertain. I will be your friend and future, everything. Just as you are for me. When you're away, I'm afraid. And the world becomes a horrible place. But when you're with me, my fear disappears. And life is wonderful. Don't ever leave me again. I never will. I promise. Tomorrow, your father will give us his blessing. And then we'll go to my people. I've never seen your land. You'll love it as much as I do. Having you is enough to make me happy. And little Yusuf, he'll come with us too. He never knew his mother. She died when he was born. You'll bring him up. I'll love him as if he were my own son. During all these years, every time you were far away, I looked into his eyes, long and deeply. And it seemed that it was you and not he who looked back at me. We'll be so happy from now on. We'll never leave each other again. What's that noise? Perhaps, it's only my horse. Hadji Murad! Don't move, you're surrounded! I want to parley with you! Don't return fire! Fire but be careful not to kill him. Come on! Don't shoot! Hadji Murad! Get back! Get back! Get out! Get out of the way! They've hurt him! - Out of the way! Stand aside! Move! Out of the way! Get back! Get back! Out of the way! I warned you about him. You should never have let him go. Now that he has joined the Russians, he'll take vengeance on us. No. I can't believe it of him. Forgive me for being blunt. But your excessive indulgence brought him to this. He had become ambitious and it that which turned him against us. He's at the Russian HQ now. Perhaps, at this very moment, the Russians know our most secret plans. We must give up the Black Mountains. - We'll never do that. Never, I tell you. Friendship. Honor. Loyalty. They're all words with no meaning. I'll never have faith in anyone again. You must have faith only in me. We still have one important advantage over him. His wife and son are in our hands. Hadji Murad must be denounced as a traitor to the people. In every village, it must be proclaimed that no one may offer him aid without incurring the severest punishment. Give me the authority to carry out these measures. This must be done! You understand? Yes. It must be done. You're right. I want to see Aslan Bey. - At this hour? - Immediately! There's a man who wants to see you. In the name of heaven, what are you doing here? You want them to kill us all? Where is Sultanet? - How should I know? Your master carried her away. But you must leave. They mustn't find you here. We've had enough trouble. They sent the soldiers here and took Hadji Murad's son away by force. Yusuf? - Yes. I'm telling you the truth! They say Hadji Murad betrayed our cause and went over to the Russians. Do you believe that? I don't know. What does it matter what I believe? The only thing I'm sure of is, if they find you here, we're doomed. Don't be afraid. I'm going. How do they do it in the mountains? Do you have your doctors? I'm your doctor. Doc-tor! Doesn't he know our tongue? - Perfectly. But he refuses to speak. Very good. I'm glad to meet you at last, Hadji Murad. Get up! His Excellency represents the Tsar…! Absolutely not. He mustn't tire himself. He's… wounded. I'm sorry about what happened but you know what they say about love and war. Let's hope it winds up being a case of love! How is he? The prisoner will be better in a few days, Excellency. Prisoner? I hope you'll consider yourself my guest. But what's the matter? Doesn't he understand? Now, listen to me, Hadji Murad. I made every possible effort to bring you here because there were several important things I wanted to discuss with you. I've heard that you've withdrawn your people from the war against us. And I know the cause of the difference of opinion between you and Shamil. You seem to be a reasonable man. I want to negotiate the peace with you. Not now. When you're feeling better. Very good. I hope you'll be comfortable here. And that you'll discover that you're among friends. After all, we're no longer at war, you and me, right? I see you're still a little upset, and not inclined to conversation. Well, there's no hurry. If you please. I hope you will accept this small gift as a token of my esteem. Among your people, the custom is to exchange gifts between host and guest. I know your customs. See? The prisoner! Stop him! "And he took her in his arms…" - This way! I… Water, quickly! Splendid! Truly quite lovely. You're extraordinary. A true artist. Then, Princess, may I hope that you'll allow me to do your portrait one day? Certainly! If you promise to make me more beautiful. You can be sure, Princess, that in your case, no expedient will be necessary to make your beauty stand out. He tried to kill himself, didn't he? He'll come drink tea with us before the night is over. Gentle as a lamb. Let's hope he can play cards. We can always teach him. Yes. You're Princess Vorontzov. I should've known. The joke was at my expense. I don't want to have fun behind your back. I'm sorry about all this. I wanted to tell you I'm grateful for your behavior during our first meeting. I promise that you won't be mistreated. Your husband said the same thing. "I'm not a prisoner. We're friends." These are the tokens of friendship, right? I'm sorry but it was necessary. We had to protect you from yourself. I'd rather be dead than held here. No. You must live. What do you care if I live or die? Your people have need of you. Only you can help them. - By making a pact with your husband and enslaving my people for the Tsar? Is that why he sent you? He didn't send me. I'd really like to help you. Is this how you help me? I'm a prisoner. My people are without a leader. My son has no one to defend him. You could see him again very soon. Why won't you negotiate? Sooner or later, there must be peace. Why not now? The Russians will only crush our country again. You're nothing but a vile traitor. As soon as I'm out of here, I'll tell what you did. Who would believe that it was me who gave Hadji Murad to the Russians? Instead, everyone's convinced that he is a traitor who went to join our enemies of his own free will. No one will ever be able to prove the contrary, since his desertion. Shamil will believe what I say! He will, I tell you! The king is very ill and doesn't believe anyone anymore. He has lost faith in humanity. He now believes only in me. Perhaps you don't know it yet, but I've become very powerful. More powerful than you could ever imagine! And therefore, you have everything to gain by marrying me. You're a stubborn minx. But I like you all the better, because you're not afraid of anything. I hope our children will resemble you. If you take another step, I'll kill myself! Perhaps you don't realize it, but in the end, you'll love me willingly. And then it'll be you who begs to marry me! What the devil's going on? Well? What happened? - Some men tried to get in the villa. We killed one, Excellency and captured another. The rest got away. Where is the one you caught? - We brought him down to the cells. He seems rather obstinate, if I may say so. But our men are taking care of him now. Let's go. Come, let me look at you. Who are you? - It's no use. He won't talk, Sir. He has only said his name is Eldar. However, we've been informed he's the right-hand man of Hadji Murad. I see. It's just as I thought. Oh, well… Try to pass the night comfortably, since it's to be your last one. Continue. Forgive me, Your Excellency. Shall we execute him tomorrow? - I don't know. We'll see. He might be useful to us. Good morning, my dear friend. I hope you slept well. It was a rather upsetting night for all of us. Take a glance over there. Eldar! Last night, we caught him prowling about the garden. Evidently, he wanted to help you to escape. Very generous and praiseworthy. His friendship deserves a better recompense on your part. What do you mean? I mean that because of you, he will be shot in… …exactly 3 minutes. What do you want me to do? Nothing that is dishonorable. I only want to discuss the conditions of the peace. Platoon! Attention! In exactly 1 minute, the captain will give the order to fire. Aim! But you still have time to save your friend's life. Decide! Time is flying. Very well. Tell your men to untie me. Bad news: 4 of our garrisons have been attacked. Several officers and soldiers were killed. It's evident the rebels are beginning to suspect our weakness. But if you succeed with our plan? Our plan? You mean yours and the Tsar's. A fine plan, indeed: trying to talk that savage into a diplomatic agreement! I've been talking with Hadji Murad all day. Trying to get him to sign a treaty. But he refuses! He keeps discussing and postponing. He's trying to gain time. If I had my way, I'd have his head carried through all the villages as a good example. They would understand that. They understand nothing but terror. You must insist. His people love him. If you kill him, they'll all turn against us. I'm not so sure of that. Listen to my counsel. Try to convince him again. He'll become our friend and his people will follow. The Tsar is right. It's the only sensible way. You mustn't kill him, you understand? That's a brilliant defense, Maria. One would think you're his lawyer and not his enemy's wife. For the love of God, Sergei, I'm only trying to help you. Forgive me. For a moment, I was almost becoming jealous. Stupid, right? It's my nerves. Trying to make that madman listen to reason has worn me out. Well, if he doesn't want to sign, we'll have to persuade him by stronger means. What do you mean? There are many ways of making him give in. For example, crushing his fingers, one by one, slowly, while he screams and screams, maddened with pain! Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you. You are so tender-hearted. Even that savage excites your pity. I envy him. He seems to have moved you. You can't believe such a thing. Certainly not. Otherwise, I think I would torture that man to death with a great deal more pleasure. Good night. Hadji Murad, you're in terrible danger. I know that. No, you don't understand. You're in my husbands hands. He can do whatever he likes. His only reason for not hurting you is the hope that you'll sign the treaty. Today you managed to gain time. But you can't go on this way. I'll never deliver my people into your hands. But the Tsar will allow you to govern your people. He told me so himself. He's made those promises before. He flatters and cajoles because he hopes to subdue us and enslave us forever. But can't you understand? You must give in sooner or later. The Tsar is too powerful. Why don't you do it now and gain an advantage? You could be free and live in peace. Yes. Free to forget the murders and the massacres of the Russians. You can't keep on hating them forever. You must have a home and a life, one day. Without freedom. But isn't there any way out? Have you made up your mind to be tortured to death? I can't stand it. It's all my fault. If I hadn't come here with a message from the Tsar, they wouldn't have tried to capture you. You would still be free. You must not reproach yourself. After all, you're on their side. I'm not on anybody's side. But I know I'll never have a moment's peace, if anything happens to you. Why won't you listen to me? I've much influence in St Petersburg. You would be received at court like a great king with all honors. And you and I would no longer be enemies. I'm not your enemy. But would you be happy if you had to live in the mountains among strange people, in a world that could never become yours? Certainly not. And would I be happy at your court? A savage among civilized Russians? Is that what you want? I want you to be safe and sound. That is what I want. Why does it matter so much to you? Because… Because I admire you. I believe you are a generous man, ready to sacrifice everything for what you believe in. And that is so beautiful. Poor little boy! He's the son of a traitor! You have dared to defy the authority of the king. You have attempted the abduction of the son of Hadji Murad from the king to whose care he was entrusted. Your death and that of the son of the renegade will serve as an example to all traitors! There's only one traitor here! And you know very well who he is! Beware, King Shamil! You're staining your hands with the blood of innocents! King Shamil, I have followed for 50 years in the holy war. My old body still has the scars of the Russian bullets! I beg you now to kill me! Spare me the sight of your shame! And now the boy. Yusuf! Yusuf! No! No! - No, Sultanet! Come back here! Come back! Mercy! We can't afford to have mercy on traitors. Save his life, I beg you and I will be yours! No, my dear. I want you to accept me freely and willingly. I accept you! I accept you! You swear? Yes, yes, I swear! I swear… My lord, my promised bride intercedes for the son of the traitor. And I also intercede with her. And perhaps the boy will be more useful to us alive. He'll be a valuable hostage. Yes. He's your prisoner. I entrust him to you. The boy's pardon is granted. Yusuf! My dear Yusuf! Then… …in the name… …of… He's dead. How long will it take to deliver this? - In 3 days, it'll be with Hadji Murad. You don't believe he's a traitor? - Oh, no. No one believes it. But we're all afraid. We're in terror of our lives all the time. - Hurry. You are killing your son! Sultanet! They think I'm a traitor. You know that's not true. And you must tell them. You see? These are the people for whom you want to risk your life. These hyenas, who have revolted against you, calling you a traitor, are now ready to kill your son. While I… …offer you glory, freedom… …and vengeance. I only have to give the order and your son will be here in 3 days. Akmet Khan will see to it that he's delivered to me safe and sound. Akmet Khan? This is all his work. Not a very clean individual, eh? He has betrayed all of you. He was very useful to me. But I'm ready to drop him as soon as he has served my purposes. The people hate him but love you! That is why I need you. If I could only get my hands on him. That shouldn't be difficult. You only have to sign this. Otherwise, your heroism will save neither you, nor your son. And Akmet Khan will receive the crown from the hands of the Tsar himself. Shamil will discover who has betrayed him. I don't think so. By now, it's too late. Akmet Khan has already decided to remove Shamil from our path. There are deadly poisons which work very quickly. Will you sign? I will never sign. I won't betray my people! To our beloved sovereign, Tsar Nicholas the 1st, emperor of all the Russias, to him who protects us, and who is our leader, let us, with the greatest reverence, raise our glasses! Long live the Tsar! Long live the Tsar! Damned white devil! Are you going to sign? No. Excuse me, Excellency, is it true Hadji Murad will attend the ball? I think he's busy tonight. Your Excellency, the princess wishes to speak to you most urgently. Where is she? - In your study, Excellency. Where is Hadji Murad? He's in good hands, my dear. Then it's true. And I didn't want to believe it. You've had him tortured! I'm sorry they told you. I wanted it to be a surprise. Because I knew it would make you so happy. I mean, he's going to sign the treaty. A triumph, my dear. A triumph… …of your exquisite diplomacy. In a month we'll be back in St Petersburg. Everyone will admire you. And they will envy me because I've such a clever wife. The Tsar will pay you many compliments, as usual. And as usual, I will be happy to bathe myself in you reflected glory. Let him go free. My dear, you're behaving in a very strange manner. I'll say it again, Sergei, I want you to let him go free! That depends on him. Come, dear, control yourself. If you don't, I'll kill you! Then you do love him! Yes, I love him! Well, what do you have to say? That I'm crazy? I certainly must be! For all those who are wallowing in vice and hypocrisy like you are unable to comprehend the soul of a man who is ready to die for an ideal! But I do understand him. I understand and admire him! I know that he'll never give in to a coward like you! Whore! I'll make him pay for this too! I'll drag you before him! And I'll cut him to pieces before your very eyes! It will be a magnificent farewell between 2 lovers! A sight that I wouldn't miss for anything in the world! Go to hell! Get out! But Your Excellency, Hadji Murad has decided to sign. Bring him here. See? Your plan was a success after all. So this is your hero. This is the man you consider to be so worthy of respect. He's no more heroic than some third-rate brigand found in children's tales. And you fell in love with him. My poor Maria. Come now. Let's forget all that has happened. You've always been a bit romantic, my dear. And the air of this country has gone to your head a bit. It'll pass off as soon as we get back to St Petersburg. No. Stay here. My victory is your victory. It's only right that you should enjoy it too. I see that you are dressed to suit the occasion. Are you still ready to sign? Yes, I'll sign. You've won. I was foolish to hold out. A cigar? May I have my son back? First, you must sign. Will you free Eldar too? When you have signed. Forgive me, General, but I prefer it to be done first. It's my fault that he's here. Very well. He will be a witness to our pact. Bring the prisoner here! Unshackle him and bring him a chair. Do you feel ill, Princess? Please, leave me. Well, my friend, this is a day of joy for you too. From this day on your master is my friend. And you are a subject of His Imperial Majesty. The end justifies the means. Follow my example, if you love freedom. Are you ready? Jump out, Eldar! Alarm! Close the gates! You mustn't be so sad. This will be a very happy day for you. You'll see. You'll be queen and reign with me. We'll go down into the village for our wedding. I want everyone to be happy and in peace, at last. Alarm! Alarm! Close the gates! Hurry! Close the gates! What's happening? - Hurry! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! One of us must step aside! Don't shoot! That's an order!
