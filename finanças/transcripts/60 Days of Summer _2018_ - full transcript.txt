Don't be late. Because you don't study, earn money! Oh my, nit-picking again!! And where can I earn money seriously?

Give me, give me... Ah shit... Ah... I drink only 'Gatorade'... Has anything happened yet? Okay yet. Wow, You bear well. Because that is me, Dude. Don't even talk. Old bastard's personality is so terrible. Really terrible. He makes me mad. That's his capability! So? What are you going to do? Hey, I must endure. Just two months... Ah. he said I'd better work to earn money. Eh? Was it a lie that he has much money? No, because I don't go to the school so I have to work a part-time job. Oh. Oh my! Asshole, why are you doing that? Let's eat something... Gaeul will come. Shit... Oh. So did you make breakfast? Yes I did as he ordered me. Hey, but there was only one egg left... so I just cooked it... The smell of It was shit.

Sure you will be shocked, It could have gone worse. Just a moment... Eh, stay a moment. Be careful all of you darlings. One of guys is not tall. He was short... Fucking guy, you bother an old lady for fun? Yeah, so terrible. So how did he look like? Did you see his face? Hmm... Hmm? How could you catch the face? She would not have a chance to see his face in that situation. I... saw the face... What have you been doing until now? Don't you get to sleep? What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. Then, come here. I branched a cafe on online... Oops! Online cafe? I want it to play some music and make it cool looking, but I have no idea how to operate it. Wow, I can't really adapt to your style. What is your online cafe name? 'People with silvery wings' I do some riding... Wow, You have some various entertainments to do! Can you make this to look awesome and cool somehow? Me? Why me? Well, you said we are family last time! I will make the breakfast tomorrow. Perhaps that would not satisfy me.

Wh... what? Carrycus? You know, the painting that transforms into like real photos? Painting? Who will paint it? If you can't make it work, just upload some nice and tidy photos. Photos?

I would like to upload a montage sketch of the criminal... Something like Looking for a witness or Wanted sign. It is the first floor, The door opens. Don't you think that hat looks like old fashioned? What? Old fashioned? The fashion is a cycle! I think you should change your hat too! This hat is my fashion emphasis. Tut tut... It's an unbalance. Young people don't know fashion! Unbalance? Grandpa! What is unbalance? Hat? Fashion? Eh? Jaehoon! What brings you here? I came to see 'Yoonsung'. Here? Eh... - Oh my...

You are like a movie actor or something. That one. Ha Jungwoo from the movie 'Assassination' Hey, let me try it. Uh-oh! It doesn't look like If it matches well with your clothes. Hey! Unbalance is a key emphasis of the fashion, you know? What an unbalance?! Shit! Yoonsung, what do you do these days? I don't see you often. I was away so that you two can go for a date. Nice sense... Hey, does the car even have enough petrol left? The bro will charge it up for you. Uh-oh? You don't even have money, idiot. Yea. What do you mean by that? You are rather pretty much empty. I haven't seen you paying for someone. You don't have to care about my business little kids. Okay little ones? Darling! Open your mouse... Our cafe name is 'People with silvery wings'. How does it sound? Is everyone impressed? Do you like it? Yes!! Stop chasing after me. It's troublesome... Phooey... You chased me today, Daring. Hey, hey, hey! It's a crystal. For real! What is it? What? oh! Jaehoon! Come quickly! Hurry! Come here! Any space? None. None. Go that way. There's no space for parking... How about there at the front? Let's see. Go first. Go first. It seems to be empty. The day goes long during the parking... Isn't it empty there? Hey! Hey! It's empty here. Really! Oh, Nice one bro... I told you, right Gaeul? Reverse... What happened? Hey! Did you crash to it? No shit! I didn't! Jaehoon! Let's park somewhere else. Hey, wait a sec. What should we do? Hey, Is it scratched? Ah! Shit! What should I do now? - Is it scratched? - Be quiet! Oh shit! Hey, get in first now! Why? What's wrong? Why do we walk leaving the elevator behind? To check If there's any security camera around. Oh... Security camera. Lee Jaehoon! What are you doing here guys? Grandpa... Guys, this is my grandfather. Hello! I am Sim Gaeul. What is even your name? Me me...? Hello. I am Kim Yoonsung. 'One of guys is not tall. He was short... 'He didn't wear glasses and on his arm, he had some kind of black spot or bruise...' 'He looked a bit dense and stupid...' Go home early guys. Goodbye! Why do you smile? Shit! Then, should I cry? Where the hell are you even going out to? What's your future plan? Come on. Why would you say like that to me again? Like a bustard. Bustard? Bustard! Can you at least think while you are living unless you are not a human? I think too! I don't live without thoughts. You must think it's easy to live without thoughts. Do you have any plan? What can I do with a plan? People say it's all nonsense and ignore the plan. What do you want to be? Eh? An author. Eh? An author? Look! You laugh at me too! I wanted to be a webcomic author! Do you even know what a webcomic is? What? Web... what? Look! You don't know! Wow! But, did he not see the scratch? Well, if he found it out, he would have found it out way earlier. The old bastard does not give any interest to me and his car. Okay then, can we go to 'ChunCheon' next time? Spicy stir-fried chicken is the best there. Yep. Shut up. An excellent cub Yes, that's me. Where? I know that it's a scam so I will hang up! Shit! Hey, is scam this much obsessing these days? Yes? Oh look at this? Can you hear me? I'll buy you a ramen. Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Hey, I'm very sorry, but I really must go. I'm really sorry. OK? What do you mean? How can you go now? We have already arrived here! It's going to be a short moment. Don't go! Sorry. I gotta go. Shit! You disloyal son of a bitch! Just go. Go! Sorry! oh...! Hello student? So why did you do it? I'm not a student and I didn't do it either. I was going to let you go easy, but not anymore. It wasn't me. Do you have any evidence? It was recorded through all the dash cams around and are you going to keep lying? There was no appropriate measure after the accident!! It's called running away. Do you even know how grievous offense it is? You didn't have to make it worse If you have apologised and negotiated an agreement for the victim earlier. May I negotiate the agreement even now? The victim is already offended. Would you do it if it were you? Jaehoon! Hey, it's okay. Piss off. You disloyal son of a bitch. Ah, I am strongly sorry. I was just busy before. Fuck off. How did it go? An agreement will do. How much is the agreement money? I keep being sorry. I will go now for today. And about the agreement money or something, I will try to help you to get some money. Sorry. I'm in a real hurry. Sorry! Hey, where are you going again? Am I a beggar. Shit! How are you, sir! Who? It's me. Do you not remember me? It's really nice to see you again, right? Nice to see you. Sir? Do you not know me? Me? Of course you don't because I don't know you too So can you see what's happening now? Aye? You can't do this to me although you are having a hard time, young men! No... I was going to be a bit generous to you, but... You old man. Talk nicely. Okay? Mon... money is not the problem, guys! For fuck's sake. This bastard. You talk too rudely. Hey! Grandpa! Give me money. I won't give you even a cent! I'm not going home yet. Then, shall I go out now? Forget it. I'll go home anyway sometime soon, but... Should I go out now? What are you saying? First, I'll go home when grandpa is asleep. When are you going home then? I must go into my room at 11 o'clock. I guess I still have about 30 minutes left? Then, shall I go out now? Hey! It's okay! I keep getting a call from someone who I don't know. Hang up first. Who are you? Yes, that's me So who are you? Pardon? Yes. Well, the same incident is happening very frequently in your town. We do try our best to enforce... Hey you idiot! We do try our best to enforce... I am very sorry for you anyway... I know you are feeling very uncomfortable, but look closely to the montage sketches of the criminals and... You too, it seems to be like they are at your age and report immediately to us If you would know them. I get it, just arrest them as soon as possible. Grandpa! Hey, you are making me embrassed. It's okay now. They'll arrest them soon. Right. We will catch them soon and don't worry too much. By the way, your grandpa shocked... Where's Yoonsung by the way? I don't know too. What is this moron these days... He disappears often. Jaehoon, do you have a mirror? Why would you look for a mirror here? Oh no, I think a contact lens fell out... Hello! Mr Lee... I am still okay as a man. Wow, what a relief! Seriously, why is the world so harsh?! It is okay. What's the point of exercise? We are all just old people! Our reaction ability gets worse! We are not recommended to drive as well! It was two people, so... Yes, of course. This is a good fortune just like this. By the way, is it your grandson who just left? Wow, he doesn't look like you at all. His father should be handsome, he is very good-looking! He looks just alike me... Yes, that's right, the shape of eyes... Where? Not at all... So, did you see the criminal's face? How are you? I'm going out soon. I'll be late, too. Are you meeting someone? I have difficulty with movement yet. It looks fine though. Are you meeting that guy again? The guy called something like Yooseok? Now you interfere? And who is Yooseok? The guy who has a black spot on this arm. Looking dumb one. Oh, Yoonsung? Right, he looks dumb, but did he have a black spot on his arm? Don't trust your friends too much. You may feel if friends are everything... but there are some people who you shouldn't meet, too. I didn't like his impression... What do you mean? And why? He doesn't even go to school, right? Is it bad for not going to school? Your grandson doesn't go to school as well! I'm not a bad guy! Hew... this stubborn bastard... Old bastard talks stubbornly always... Bastard? I told you not to call me a bastard!? And you! I told you to do it correctly, didn't I? What is it again! What did I do wrong? Socialize with right friends!! Shit. Now you interfere with me socializing my friends?! He is my bestie, did you know? So please stop it. I won't see you again If you talk more! You call a thief as a friend! I saw his black spot on his arm? He is the criminal!! Shit! Seriously! Who do you mean! He isn't! I'm very sorry, but I really must go. I'm really sorry. Ok? And about the agreement money or something, I will try to help you to get some money. Sorry. I'm in a real hurry. Sorry! Please call again... Shit, this moron must be crazy. Why does he not answer the call? Hey! What is that moron? Shit really... Hey. Don't you want to work? Eh? Why? There, he wants to quit the job. Sir, am I the person to work here? I'm busy. I hardly stopped him from leaving right now. Help me. Until I get another worker! I still don't want to. Will you give me a meal? Yes... What about sleep? Sure... Ah... It's tiring... What? What are you? Why are you here? I work for your agreement money after you bought a car. You won't be able to earn money since you don't have any experience yet. Why do you now answer the phone then? I may want to hang out. I may want to run to you. Do you know how hard it was? Hungry and... I'm so hungry... It's him... - No way... - They don't give me a meal... So, your grandpa suspects me as a criminal? Not just suspecting. It's a conviction. Wow, seriously? How could I be it? Wow, that's too much. I suspected you a bit, too, moron. What? Did you actually run away from home? Shit! I am mortified. I am very mortified! Seriously! hat did I do wrong... But I think the bastard would be mortified, too. What? Why? Let's arrest them. What, how? Who!!?? I am mortified, too. Those morons, I will arrest them by myself. Your revenge. Grandpa's revenge. I will do them all! This is my boy, mate! Hey, get off first. Hey. What is it? Is it a black spot? Ahhhhh. It's a bruise not a black spot!!! Your friend is hurt because of you... aye? The ears look like this. The lips look like this. Yeah yeah. Look at the eyes... How big are clothes? Hm? I saw this person before... comic? He has a black spot on his arm... should I draw the arm as well? He has black spot on his arm? Big one? I know someone like. Who? You sure about this? I am! By the way, why do you go that internet cafe often? It's still 80 cents. You traitor... - Bro, I have to pee. - What? I must be nervous. Then, hurry up! Sorry, this one. It is coming... It feels good! There he is! There he is! Really? But why are we hiding? I don't know. Hey, I am sure he is, no, that bugger. I have no Idea. But he is not that guy with a black spot. Then who? wait a second. He will come soon. Hey! That dude. That dude! Coming? Let's check one more time. I am sure he is... What should we do? Follow behind them. Let's go... - You go first... - Damn... Let's go together... I am coming... What the hell? I guess it is today. Let's catch the scene. But why we? I am going to catch them. How? Even you lose a battle with me. Then would you just leave it? Grandpa almost died. No. Can... we Just call the police? Then how about the old lady! Come on, idiot. Hey... bro... just call the police! Madam. Do you not know me? She doesn't know. Old lady, give your ring, necklace, wallet to us. Help, help me! So, give it to us! I will let you go! Huh?? This is the problem of old generation, no quiet old cuss. Hey! What are you? Me? I am the victim's grandson. And this man! What? Hey, get up. Hey, wait a second. He's the son of a bitch, a paltry fellow from the internet cafe'? What? Do you know him? He's an asshole from the part time job. You take this one!! Shit, this is so bothersome. You! Take this idiot quickly! Okay... You! Let go! Stop right there! You motherfucker! Jaehoon! Lee Jaehoon? Yep. Well-done, good work. By the way... you've received notification of attendance because of traffic accident. What happen to consult with victim? Well... I don't know how to do this, so... You don't? I am sorry... Grandfather settled right after accident. There is no problem because of the insurance. However, you better take the responsibility and apologizeabout the accident. Do not just pretend like you don't know. Do you understand? Here. Victim's number. Call him and apologize politely. Grandfather specially asked me to tell you off. And this. I found this on crime scene, it belongs to your grandfather. It is a special gift for you, because we have enough evidence. We found the tablet, but we couldn't find the pen. And your grandfather grasped it in his hand. He was strong... does he work out? That day... buying this on his way? I don't know that, but anyway it was found from the crime scene... That is a good guess. Do well to your grandfather, idiot. W... what...? Get out, If you don't like, get out! okay? Well, you said we are family last time! Go home early guys. Ah, shit, seriously grandpa... Get home early! Yes, sir! That was a long trip leaving a child to you. I am sorry. I don't owe you an apology. Take him, now. What the heck? Am I a piece of luggage? What's with this vibe? Now, I need to show you something! Grandfather didn't like my mother drawing. So, my father didn't like him. But, a little life was growing inside. Father. The time passed by hating each other building a small gap between the two. Feelings of hurt slowly removed the memory of each other over and over. If they don't understand, the misunderstanding won't be solved, even if time goes by. They waited each other and wanted to speak. But, they just waited. Eat rice. So, they pretend not to and lost each other, like the old cover of an old book. I am going. Do you Know... what was the saddest thing? When I run away from home? No. When I didn't call you when Jaehoon was born? None of them. I must have committed a lot of crime to you. So, what, father? You didn't come when your mother fainted? Right? No? I went every time? Before an operation. You didn't come once. I was so scared being myself In front of operating room. A brave man like you?! It doesn't matter brave or not. It is all the same... In front of person you love. I shouldn't had opposed Jaehoon's mother like that. I am so sorry for everything before, father. I didn't do well too. Well then! I will foot the bill! Let's celebrate! You... Well... then... I will drive too! But, shouldn't we drink the champagne as well? Why are you alone even you went to the US? I will need some time to think for a while. What? Did you get dumped? I did not get dumped! Then? Did you dump her? Well... no... You idiot! Live alone! Father, I am full of love so I would be hard as a single. Jaehoon! Who did call her? I did. Well well... You are great father! What do we do with the burnt ones? Where did you say your father is going this time? Japan. He will go to Japan. He doesn't have his own business to do. Grandpa. I'm better than my father, right? He is my son anyway though. Oh? Are you standing on a side? I'm just saying... Grandpa. How about a trip just with you and me? I like trip. Well, trip cost must be half half. That's too much! Seven to three! Who's seven? Eh?!
