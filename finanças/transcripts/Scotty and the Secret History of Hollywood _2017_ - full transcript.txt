- [Answering Machine] Two new messages. Message one. - [Bernardo] Hi, Scotty, it's Bernardo. I got your message. So call me any time you want to see me or get together. We look forward to seeing you. (birds chirping) - Bernardo took me shopping. I mean, I paid for it, but he took me shopping. (laughs) Bernardo insisted that I have a handkerchief for the pocket too. Jeez, I hope it fits. - [Matt] When was the last time Scotty was dressed like this? - When we got married. (Scotty laughs) Hey! (&quot;It had to be you&quot; instrumental) - [Scotty] You look so pretty, honey. - This is the birthday man. - Happy Birthday, Scotty! - He only looks a day over 50. (&quot;It had to be you&quot; instrumental) - [Man] Andreas, for 40 years. - You're looking wonderful. We're talking about the Gomorrah of Hollywood. - Talking about what? - [Woman] The Gomorrah of Hollywood. - It's amazing! Can you believe it? - He must've lived his life in a good way, because look at him, and he's 90 years old. - I'm telling you, he worked every day of his life. And God knows he partied, you've read his book. (&quot;It Had to be You&quot; instrumental) - Are you still working? (laughs) We wanna know if you're still working. - You might say that. - [Man] Scotty? Oh, Scott, where are you? I think there's something with your name on it over here. (lively instrumental music) - [Crowd] Yay! - [Man] 90 and still going! - Happy birthday, Scotty. - Thank you. That was so nice of you. - It wasn't until I started working my book on Katharine Hepburn. I was talking to some of the other biographers, and they said to me, &quot;You know, there's this character out there &quot;that you really should try to talk to, &quot;and his name is Scotty Bowers. &quot;And he had this gas station, and he, &quot;you know, he supplied men and women &quot;to the various Hollywood stars. &quot;He knew, he knows all about that era, &quot;but you know, you'll never get to talk to him.&quot; I began to think that maybe he was an urban legend. (laughs) You know, that there was no Scotty Bowers. (lively horn music) - Did you have a little black book? - No. - No? You kept it all in your head? - Yes, yes. - Some people have described you as a sort of pimp to the stairs. - [Scotty] Oh, yes. - [Anthony] In the book you say you were just trying to help people out. - Yes, I was. - [Anthony] But the risks, particularly for gay or bisexual actors, were serious. - [Scotty] I met Cary Grant first, then Randolph Scott. Back in those days, people knew they were lovers. - I've lost my clothes. - But why are you wearing these clothes? - Because I just went gay all of a sudden! - People are very invested in the establishment view of Hollywood movie star history, which Scotty's story re-tells in an honest way and in a way that's more true to what was going on. - [Scotty] 90% of jobs could be lost from being gay. You were in the closet, basically. So many people were. This is why what I did in the gas station was so nice for people. - You don't think this thing is gonna get around? You don't think everybody's gonna know about it? I won't even be able to show my face in Lindy's. - People get very angry at the idea of these beloved Hollywood icons being revealed to have secrets. But actually, all it is that Scotty is doing is revealing that these people were real. They were actual people. Flesh and blood, like us. - It turned out that Scotty was the center of a whole different alternate world. A world to which most of us had no access or knowledge. - It can add up to an awful lot of people, when you stop and think about it. You would say, each day, 365 days a year. It's certainly into the thousands. And it's hard to believe a lot of people who've only been with two or three different people would never believe it. (slow dramatic music) (birds chirping) &quot;Dear Scotty. &quot;What a read, what a life. &quot;A group of Hollywood's best writers &quot;could not have made up the life you actually lived.&quot; - Really gets one who doesn't like the book. - &quot;I believe every word you wrote. &quot;Why would you lie? &quot;God, I wish I'd lived next door to you.&quot; - 'Cause those would be the ones that you would think would let him have it. Both girls, but not a one. And yet I know there are people who don't like the book. The lady that cuts your hair told me. - [Scotty] Yeah, but she's guessing. She doesn't know anybody-- - No, she, not guessing. - [Scotty] She told you there are people that don't like the book? - Because it, yeah, I told you that you took away their dream. Shame on you. - You know, there's a new book called Full Service. It's written by a man who says he used to set up gay and bisexual affairs for some of the biggest stars from the 1940s and beyond. - The point of this is, these people are now dead. They cannot answer. - Right. - Some of them have families. Is it right? Do you out people after they're dead? - Why? What does it, what does it, no, you do care because they got family. - The point is it's their business and not yours. You shouldn't out someone when they're alive and you shouldn't out them when they're dead. How's that? You shouldn't out them any time unless it's you saying it about yourself. - Unless they gave their permission. - [Whoopi] Yes, yes! - That's kinda pretty out there. I mean, with the sun in the background over there. Jesus, look at that beautiful rainbow. I created the rainbow in Hollywood. The Rainbow is at 5777 Hollywood Boulevard called Richfield, and that was a rainbow, that was the fuckin' end of a rainbow for a lot of people. I mean, it's hard to believe unless you were there, how much fun that gas station was. People disappearing up in the trailer and going in the washroom and doing this and that. The whole thing was fun. (laughs) (soft piano music) 5777 Hollywood Boulevard. And the streetcar used to go along Hollywood Boulevard, ding, ding, ding, and stop right there in front of the gas station, which was very nice. Where the gas station was is a huge three-story firehouse there now. Now, see, that's their property, came right to here, went straight back to that corner and down. And the gas station was a little thing, it was no higher where, where, than those letters that say fire station. It's so completely different now that it's hard to believe what it was then. (lively jazz music) That period of time after World War II, that was quite a different time, never to be repeated. Remember, had the war not come along, people lived on the farm and still be on the farm, like myself. I went in the Marine Corps when I was 18. My brother went in the Marine Corps two years after I did. I was in '42, '43, '44, and most of '45. (slow soft music) When you're overseas, you're a long ways away, and how many guys get killed every day, and you're burying people all the time. (slow soft music) You think, you do think you're never gonna get back home. (crowd cheering) When the war was over in '45, many guys, when they got out of the service, they went back home again to the little town, to the farm. I upgraded myself and went to Hollywood. (laughs) (slow soft orchestral music) I went and got the job at the gas station. (bell dings) The very first person I met at the gas station was Walter Pidgeon. It happened purely accidental. He drove in, in a nice Lincoln Continental. It was a hot day, and he was a real gentleman. - [Matt] Did you know who he was? - [Scotty] Not really. I just thought he was a nice guy. He said, &quot;What is a nice-looking guy like you &quot;doing working in the gas station?&quot; That type of thing. (laughs) &quot;It'd be nice to have you come and take a dip in the pool,&quot; and things like that. I got into the car and left with him. (slow soft jazz music) - [Matt] That day at the pool, what happened? - [Scotty] Well, you know, you're, you're there, and pretty soon, one person's touching. Things just automatically kind of happened. - You look at how he stumbled into this, and literally, he did stumble. But then, the key fact there is that there was a whole network of folks, certainly the set designers, the hairdressers. They were waiting for someone like Scotty to come along. - [Scotty] Edwin B. Willis, the number-one set decorator at MGM. Every picture that came out of MGM, it said, &quot;Set Decoration by Edwin B. Willis.&quot; All of a sudden, Edwin called me and says so-and-so is coming to the station, so-and-so, and this happened in a matter of days. And then, word of mouth, everything flows automatically. You couldn't believe how busy I was. I needed help. (lively upbeat jazz music) There's a place on Sunset called The Crossroads of the World. And there were women, voluntarily worked down there that would take messages. I left a number there and the guys picked it up, and pretty soon, I had about 20 guys hanging around the gas station, very soon. And these were guys who just got out of the Marine Corps too, and didn't have a dime. Somebody I knew would come in to the gas station and say, &quot;Jeez, I'd love to take that nice-looking guy to dinner.&quot; I'd say, &quot;For 20 bucks, you can suck his cock now &quot;and forget the goddamn dinner.&quot; You know, everything was $20 bucks. I would say to my friends, &quot;I'm gonna fix you up with a trick, &quot;and all the guy's gonna do is take and suck your cock, &quot;and it's the same as if your girl was sucking your cock. &quot;If you wanna close your eyes &quot;and think it's her sucking your cock, do.&quot; &quot;Okay, I'll do it once.&quot; Well, once, twice, you know. (laughs) ♪ When the world should all be sleepin' ♪ ♪ And the melody comes creepin' ♪ - [Scotty] I was fixing every bit of 20 people a night up at the gas station, seven nights a week. Behind the gas station I had this huge house trailer. Now the guy that left it gave me $50 a month to park it there. And he said, &quot;Use it any time you want.&quot; ♪ It's no cabaret ♪ - [Scotty] And you entered from the center. Up here was a king-size bed and over here was a king-size bed and they had a drape that could separate it. Son of a bitch, I had that going night and day, you know. (upbeat jazz music) And then a friend of mine, an old queen, ran a motel right across the street. He would call me and say, &quot;I have six, seven, eight, 12, and 14 vacant. &quot;The door's open. &quot;Just go right in. &quot;Five bucks, do you get what I mean?&quot; (upbeat jazz music) A lot of people liked the bathroom thing. It had a little hole, a quarter-inch hole, and I had that directly underneath the toilet paper. You would lay on the air compressor, put your eye up against the thing, and watch the washroom. So I had people in there, and I had people watching and the whole bit, you get what I mean? That's what you call business, baby. (laughs) (upbeat jazz music) (men laughing) Good to see ya. You sweet little baby, you. - Oh, I've been trying to get you over here for years. - [Scotty] You've been so nice. - I told Scotty he was so well-organized in those days. I said if you'd been in the business world instead of here, you would've ended up as chairman of General Motors. - (laughs) You sweetheart, Jack. Jack was a young trick of mine. - You picked me up in Acapulco. - That, that's right. We met in Acapulco. - Acapulco. - Son of a bitch, that's right. (laughs) - [Jack] Where did those years go? - [Scotty] Jesus, I don't know. Those years slipped by, Jack, so quick. - This, this was a book you had to write. But everyone trusted you. Did, did anyone ever bother saying to you, you know, &quot;You would never betray me, would you?&quot; I mean-- - That's why, when everyone was living, I would never even think, under any circumstances, no god-damned dime, and no matter what anyone offered me, I wouldn't write a book then. (people chattering) (cameras clicking) - All those people. - Ya. - Don't you think you misled their trust by writing a tell-all book? - A lot of people at the time knew what, who these people were and what they were, so it's not a secret, really. It may be a secret to some square that lives in Illinois, but people who lived in Hollywood, they knew these people. - Yeah, but you, but for their fans, I mean, like if they had a grand kid, the grand kid remembers, &quot;Oh no, my grandfather was gay,&quot; or whatever like that. - What's wrong with, what's wrong with being gay? So, but thanks anyhow. - [Man] Okay, that's just my feedback. - No, I can, I can see it. Thank you. Thank you. I did the book just to show some of these people that people are still people. But some of these squares think oh my God, you're weird, you're different, you know. Like, ladies would say to me, &quot;Just what are you?&quot; I said, &quot;I'm everything.&quot; (man laughs) - [Woman] Thank you. - [Photographer] One more, one more. There we go. (men laughing) - Just Hollywood trash, Scotty. You and I traveled on the same highways and low life, and the alleyways. - [Scotty] That's right. - You know I worked for George Cukor for two years. And, and Katharine Hepburn lived down in the guesthouse. You know, she would come up, &quot;George, George! &quot;I hope you're not up there spilling the beans about us, &quot;telling, telling the truth! &quot;We've been in the closet for 40 years, &quot;and don't, don't you,&quot; and, you know, finally we had to cancel the book, and he, George hated it. George had to give back a $75,000 advance. That nearly killed him. - [Narrator] George Cukor has been the center of more controversies than any other director in the history of Hollywood. He's not only directed a string of highly successful pictures like Little Women, Philadelphia Story, and Adam's Rib, but he's also been fired from quite a few, including Gone with the Wind. (slow soft bass music) - [Scotty] I met George in 1947. George came in the gas station in his new black Dodge Sedan, introduced himself, and invited me up to the house. Within a few days I was up here. He almost came on like Walter Pidgeon. &quot;It's a hot day. I'd love to have you come up, &quot;take a dip in my pool, and cool off,&quot; and things like that. - [Narrator] George Cukor has never married, but lives alone in a palatial home in Beverly Hills, a house which has seven living rooms and only one bedroom. - George Cukor was, really one of the arbiters of Hollywood society. He was someone who had the greatest parties, he, he knew everyone. (soft orchestral music) - On Saturday nights, there were like the great, elegant soirees with the kings and queens of Hollywood: Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Garbo. Sunday afternoons around the pool was brunch with 10, 12, 15 of the most beautiful men in Hollywood. Scotty Bowers would always provide new talent. - George Cukor was the epicenter for gay Hollywood in the '30s, '40s, and '50s. If George gave his seal of approval to someone, the rest of the community looked on with favor. George respected Scotty. He wasn't simply this Madam Cukor called for events, he was also a friend of George Cukor's, and Scotty became friends with many of Cukor's friends. (soft piano music) (birds chirping) - [Scotty] That son of a bitch is loaded with stuff in there, wow! (laughs) - [Matt] How many garages like this do you have? - Let's see, I have one, two, three, four, about five full. I started this, Jesus, 25 years ago, I guess. And I kept packing in, packing in until you couldn't even move anything. (birds chirping) The pictures should be in here. These were all the guys from the gas station. All clean-cut, nice-looking guys, aren't they? - [Matt] When was the last time you saw those photos? - Uh, about the time they were taken. (laughs) But I haven't seen them since then. I forgot about them completely. Every one of these guys, including the girl, were all hustlers, every one of them. (laughs) (steady jazz music) Ronnie Stinson was my buddy from Regina, Saskatchewan. One of my number one guys, Ronnie was. Bob Atkinson had a big prick, and Bob was out of the Navy. He had a nice rugged look about him, looked like a cowboy, you know, that type of thing. Georgie Fargo from Chicago, put him on a few tricks, he wasn't great. His heart wasn't in it. One day, I introduced him to Clint Eastwood, and he and Clint were buddy-buddy, and, and Clint got him a part in pictures. And Lee was a pretty, little, 21-year-old boy that every fucking queen in Hollywood was hot for. (laughs) - [Matt] Are any of these guys still alive? - Some of them are still living. Lee, Lee's old, but he's still around. (Scotty laughs) Hello, baby. When I think of Lee, I can only think of nice things, and a smile comes on my face, because here we are back together. It was a cool little car, that little '55 way back. - [Matt] Some people don't believe the book. What do you say to those people? - I showed it to a friend of mine. He thought it was trash. I said, &quot;Well, it's, maybe, that's your opinion, &quot;but it's all true.&quot; - [Matt] About what year did Lee show up at the gas station? - 1951. I came into Hollywood. I saw this sign on a glass window and it said, &quot;Are you looking for employ?&quot; I said yes, so he hired me right there. - [Scotty] Right then and there. The moment he walked in, he was on his, he was on his first trick, right, within a, within an hour. (laughs) - Customers please, Scott. - I must have given you this card 60 years ago, right? These are basically business people out of New York. Don't forget, I was fixing an awful lot of people up that weren't famous, too. This is just a backup. So when you go to New York, in case something happens with the deal you got, you got somethin' to fall back on for a ticket back home, you know? What the hell. - Well, this is a program from a Shakespeare's Memorial Theater. Charlie autographed it for me. He said, &quot;Lee, to Lee, who bawled the hell out of me &quot;until I did this. &quot;Gratefully, Charles Laughton.&quot; That's Charlie here, King Lear. - Lee was Charles Laughton's favorite, and Charles loved Lee, really he did. - [Lee] Charlie, he was a beautiful man. He really was. - [Woman] Hello, Charles. How are you? - Hello, gentlemen. - How do you do? - Hello, Elsie. - [Lee] And whenever he had problems with Elsie, he'd call me up and we'd go have dinner some place. - Hello, come on in. - Come on. - [Lee] I was a good listener. - [Matt] What did Charles like to do sexually? - He just likes to suck cock. (laughs) - That's right. (lively jazz music) Charles Laughton and I were very close from, way back from World War II and up until he died. I saw him myself and fixed him up with tricks. Charles was going to England, I drove him to the airport. And Charles, he gave me an envelope and I looked at it later, it was a thousand dollars. It's ten $100 bills that he gave to me. That's just being, being nice, you know. I certainly didn't ever ask for it. (lively upbeat jazz music) The world was different then than it is now. (birds chirping) You know, every four or five days you gotta run this up, you know. (clock winding) This is a little house that I paid $22,000 for, about 52 years ago. $22,000 for the house in $20 bills. You know, those $20 add up quick. (laughs) There are some pretty things in here, you know, but... Underneath it all, I meant. I lived here with Bette for just a dash over 50 years, I guess. Bette was my first wife. You might say that we were common-law. We never really married. And, and as many years as I've been here, I rarely ever stayed here, considering my work. There were some years I might be here one and two nights in a year. There are some nice little goodies in here. These are, these things in the house are called goodies. Bette had it very nice, really, she did. It's me that fucked it up. And then that's Donna when she was a little girl that a friend of mine painted. I'm rarely here. I come up, get the mail, get some phone calls and, and other than that, I don't even come here. - [Answering Machine] Message two. - [Gerard] Hey, Scotty, it's Gerard from Book Soup. We were wondering if you could come in and sign some books for us when you get a chance. Thanks. (birds chirping) - [Man] West Hollywood Book Fair this weekend, so we wanted to take some signed stock back. (woman chattering) - Boy, they have a book on everything here. Randolph Scott, Cary Grant. What was so funny is they, they lived right behind the Chateau Marmont there. And they lived at the beach too, they lived right at Santa Monica Beach. And they lived together, of course, people said they were roommates. Okay, we're roommates. I mean lot of people who are lovers are roommates too. - Well, I feel it's about time for a dip. (lighthearted orchestral music) - Young man, is that Johnny Weissmuller? - No, I wish it were. (drum roll) (lighthearted orchestral music) - [Scotty] Back in those days, people knew they were lovers and together. Then, all of a sudden, as years go by, they're kinda, &quot;How dare you talk that way?&quot; But I'm not talking about them, I'm just saying they're great guys, you know, both of them. (moves into soft piano music) I'd been with them individually and both of them, what you call a three-way, and I've also brought another buddy for them to where there were four of us, you know, two-and-two. (soft jazz music) Before he became an actor, a known actor, Cary Grant was living with Orry Kelly in New York, who was a mad queen. Orry Kelly was a dress designer. Actually, he got three Oscars for dress design. - Some Like It Hot. Orry Kelly! - [Scotty] Then he came out here and lived here for a year and a half together. Then he met Randolph Scott and left Orry, dropped him like a hot potato, because he wanted to steer clear for fear they might think he's gay, if he's with someone who's known to be gay. (upbeat jazz orchestral music) - When Hollywood began, when the studio system really got, got rolling, Hollywood was a rollicking place, there were very, very few rules. It was a haven for people who lived larger than life, had radical views about sex or politics. And there were, you know, lot of same-sex cohabitation, people, men and women living together who weren't getting married. The kind of rules that, and, and strict moral code that we associate with Hollywood came in place in the 1930s with the production code. - It's vulgar, it's cheap and the tawdry is out! There is no room on the screen at any time for pictures which offend against common decency, and these, the industry will not allow. - With the production code came morals clauses in, in people's contracts. (soft piano music) Hollywood had adopted a very different relationship with the public. It was really about, we're just like all of you. It was very important to sell this myth to America, that the movie stars were just good, honest, moral, law-abiding citizens. - If it became public that you were gay, you would be immediately fired. - When actors were under contract to their studios, everything about their life was defined: how, what they wore, how they wore their hair, you know, and they worked, very, very, very hard. They made lots of movies a year. Where could they get a real life where they could just let go and sort of undo the, the belt, as it were, and the, the constraints? Scotty gave them that. - Scotty was able to provide a very real service to these people, who otherwise were very restricted by this moral code. (slow dramatic music) (traffic humming) - Now, this is a fucking low-flush toilet. This is not a good toilet at all. That's a low-flush. Let's see. Not a bad-looking toilet, but that, that's just a recent type. I would take it otherwise, but it's not that good of a toilet. - [Matt] Where did this hole come from? - Huh? - [Matt] This hole. - Oh, she had a rug on here, and the rug dry-rotted the wood. - I fell in, and it went down up to here in this leg, and I couldn't get it out. - [Scotty] You can see that circle. See the circle? She had put a big carpet down. When you a carpet down, it dry-rots below. - Anyway, I had to call the neighbors to come and get me out. - [Scotty] So I gotta replace all of that stuff. - [TV Reporter] Police got a call that two hand grenades have been found in a fire pit in the backyard of this house. - He's just collecting things. He never did this before. Never. So it's just since we've been here. - I have every copy of Playboy Magazine since Playboy came out. - [Matt] Where are they? - Over at the other house, stacked in the basement. - [Lois] There's no room here. - Well, you know, you know how much, I got stacks this high for Christ's sake. - [Matt] Tell me about these photos on the wall. Lois, are they your family? - [Lois] That's my mother and my brother and I up there. That's me. A long, long time ago. (laughs) - [Scotty] We've been together about 35 years. And that was Cindy. The god-dammed time goes. - [Lois] We met in December of '80, we were married July '84. ♪ It had to be you ♪ - [Scotty] A friend of mine had a bar here on Robinson called Alberto's and I met her in there. She was singing at the piano bar. ♪ Could make me feel bad ♪ ♪ Even be glad ♪ ♪ Just to be sad ♪ ♪ Thinkin' of you ♪ ♪ Some others I've seen ♪ ♪ Might never be mean ♪ ♪ Might never be cross ♪ I'm singing at Alberto's. He came past me one night and said, &quot;I love your singing.&quot; I don't know, he looked like a, an old leprechaun. I mean, it was the dickens in his eyes, you know. (laughs) I don't know. ♪ Wonderful you ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ (audience clapping) - [Matt] Is that the paperback? - Yeah, it is. For a paperback it's kinda nice, you know. - Honey? - What? - Didn't you get a box of these home? - [Scotty] He took eight books out of here. Another good title would've been, How To Make People Happy. - Mm hm. - Same thing as the, the real book, yeah. - [Matt] Lois, do you think you'll be tempted to read one of them? - No, she won't. She won't read those goddamn things. Are you kidding? If she read the book, she'd jump off the balcony. She'd jump out the window. - [Matt] You're not planning on reading it, why not? - Well, two reasons. I don't, I didn't know him then. I don't know him as that person. And not sure I want to. (Scotty laughs) And I'm not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I'm just not. I guess I feel some, I don't know how you'd put it, regret. - Regret? - That he didn't say something. - [Scotty] What do you mean, say something? - Before, when I first knew you, about your life prior to my meeting you. - [Scotty] You never told me about your life prior to me meeting you. I never asked. - Ain't nothing to tell. - [Scotty] Well, you never know. I mean you could've been a hooker, I don't know. - You know what I'm talking about. Stop being silly. - [Scotty] You could've been a hooker and something. I never asked you, you know that. I'm not that type-- - Well, apparently, it didn't matter to you. It might have mattered to me. (birds chirping) (slow soft music) - Yeah, you know, the god-dammed toilet. I didn't get it right away. I got so much yesterday, yesterday afternoon. And, and... You never know when you're gonna need it, baby. (laughs) I used to take care of Beach's houses. Beach Dickerson owned about 18 or 19 houses up here. And I maintained them. I did all the plumbing in all of them. I mean, see, see Beach could count on me to do it, and do it right. Originally, Beach met me at the gas station, then we became friends. This was his house and he lived here all those years. Beach was originally from Glennville, Georgia, went in the Army, ended up in California, and stayed here, and became kind of what you call a half-assed actor. I still get checks. $1.80, $2.25 for little things he was in. You know what I mean? - [Announcer] The Creature From the Haunted Sea! (dramatic theatrical music) - [Scotty] Oh, they were class C movies by Roger Corman many years ago: The Attack of the Crab Monster and Creatures of the Haunted Sea. (soft orchestral music) Beach was my steady number-one person that I would see. Oh, that's Lois's, the Columbia University, City of New York, Lois Broad. (soft orchestral music) Beach owned about eight, eight thoroughbred horses. And the only horse he ever had that won, he named the horse Hollywood Scott. And that was the only horse he ever had that won a race. - Beach Dickerson owned a house up where I'd walk my dogs. I said, &quot;I understand, you know, &quot;we have a mutual friend, Scotty Bower.&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He said, &quot;Scotty's my lover.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, that's news to me. &quot;I didn't know Scotty had a, a gay lover up here.&quot; And he said, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; (laughs) - [Scotty] Here's Jennifer Aniston. Here's Beach. Every one of these girls are actresses, and they all lived here. And this was taken out on the patio there. Elvis Presley and a girl they were, when he worked on a show with Elvis. There's Beach and Corbin Bernsen. - [Jack] He was Beach's godson. He was on LA Law and a few things. - Beach left me two annuities, plus $300,000, plus two houses, which was quite nice. He left me this house, another house around the corner down there to sell. And the house that he left me, I sold for a little bit over $600,000. The will was made out that I have this house until I die. Then when I die, and I, I've gotta be really dead, then, and may not happen, then fuckin' Corbin gets it. See? (laughs) Corbin, when Beach died, Corbin was gonna rent a yacht and spread the ashes at sea and have a big party. He wanted something like $35,000 from the estate, and I said, don't give him a fucking dime. That's all bullshit. You know what I mean? Right now, Beach's ashes are down in, in Pat's garage in the trunk of his car where they've been for the last five years. We were always gonna do something with them, I don't know what. And then, then Pat died and they're still in the trunk of the car down there. (crickets chirping) Hello kitty. Did you know cats hate scented litter? Look. There, look at those, those eyes. You gotta say they're cute little things. David called and said they've got a check from the publishing company for $188,000. That guy from the office said, &quot;Is it okay to send to the house?&quot; I said yes, so they'll send it here. - I just wonder how they do it. Do they have an accounting? Do we know how many books were sold? Do we know what are his percentages? Nothing. - Well, whatever you get helps, you know. I mean, what the hell. - No, I'd just like to know how many books, and how much do you get, and how much do you get, and how much did David get and... - [Matt] That seems like your policy. The money takes care of itself. - That's right. Do you know there are a couple of old Jewish ladies in Beverly Hills who have money, that years ago I worked, I worked for them for $5 an hour. I go to work from them now, they have money. They hand me $20. I'm there five or six hours. I give them a kiss and say thank you, like everything is okay, right? Perfectly all right. - But they're laughing at you. (laughs) - Everything works out. Things always work out. They, they, you know... (jazzy piano music) - [Man] So Scotty, we are all big fans of your services. - There's Polish, French, and Spanish now. - We can get a German. (laughs) - Well, they're going, they're going to German and Italian in about two or three months. - Oh, yeah? - Ya. - How cool. - You know somebody emailed me just a week ago, and was asking, you know, &quot;Have you guys thought of doing something &quot;with that guy Scotty Bowers?&quot; and, &quot;He's so cute.&quot; Did you pose for Bob Mizer? - No, but I had many guys pose for Bob Mizer. Bob Mizer was kind of the number one queen of guys. (upbeat jazz music) You know, Bob Mizer was the number one photographer of boys at the time. (upbeat jazz music) - [Dian] The stories about Ewell. Did you know Tom Ewell? - [Scotty] Oh yeah, I knew Tom very well. But Tom was a mad one. - [Dian] That's what we heard. He was in The Seven Year Itch. He was an everyman. - Tom Ewell, a lot of people didn't even know he was gay. But Tom, he could see 20 guys, one right after the other, and want more. So, I called them big users. (laughs) The three, what you call big users, three of them were: Tom Ewell and Ramon Novarro and Cole Porter. Cole Porter would say, &quot;Can you bring 15 guys by? &quot;I wanna suck 15 guys off, one right after the other.&quot; ♪ You're the top ♪ ♪ You're Mahatma Gandhi ♪ ♪ You're the top ♪ ♪ You're napoleon brandy ♪ (moves into bluesy jazz music) - Normally, I would not talk about it really, but people have often said, you couldn't have done that many things in, in any given week, fixing up that many people, seeing that many people, doing this working at the gas station. You're fucking right, I did it. I fucked Bette Davis in World War II when she was married to a guy I used to fix up with tricks. And we used to have three-way deals. I went to bed with J. Edgar Hoover. He was in drag. He was not a great beauty either, you know, but I was treating him just like he's a girl. Judith Anderson was a friend of Alex Tear. Alex had said, &quot;I'm sending Scotty over with a gift.&quot; &quot;Where's the gift?&quot; I'm the gift. You get what I mean? We finally go to bed together. But she was more into girls than guys, because later I fixed her up with girls. One day Cary Grant was in the gas station and Rock Hudson just happened to be there. Cary Grant picked him out, so I fixed him up with Rock for $20. And Rock saw him several times. This is before Rock had any money. And Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, I never tricked them together. I would fix them up with guys, and then I would see her at George Cukor's house. She would come and quietly open the gate, and all the way in it was, &quot;Shh, don't say a word.&quot; 10 minutes later in the bedroom as I'm fucking her, she's screaming. - Whoo! - And Bill Holden, I fixed him up with an awful lot of girls too. When they did Sunset Boulevard right here with Gloria Swanson and Bill Holden. And Bill called me and said, come on over. - Goodbye, Norma. - [Scotty] They did night scenes at the swimming pool, behind the big house that was there. - [Gloria] Joe! - I went over and fucked around all night long while they were shooting one little scene that could've taken three minutes to shoot. And I said, &quot;Bill, forget that bullshit.&quot; (gun fires) Hi Tony. - Hello. - [Scotty] How are you, baby? - And we still, he still comes to the house and works for me. - That's right. I still come and work here. - [Tony] But Scotty, you can show them around. You know the house. - See how many Emmys Tony has right here? Right there. (birds chirping) There are some gorgeous paintings here. Oh, (laughs) that's a thing he did of me. (laughs) - Since he serviced a lot of people, and we were having a party on the Fourth of July, and so, I had to have an American flag. And, of course, he did all of his work with the telephone, and most of it in a bedroom. - I mean very clever, Tony, the way he thought when he did it. - This is from a Fourth of July event. That's Joe Kennedy from Paris, and he was Big Dick Strauss, Richard Strauss. - [Scotty] Oh, yeah. I remember him. - [Tony] We would have a parade in drag. (bluesy jazz music) - [Scotty] Tony had all kind of parties. You know me, I'm up for anything. (laughs) I'm in it for anything, anytime, you know what I mean? (laughs) (bluesy jazz music) Hi honey. - Hi. - I got your car all covered and everything. Did you find Hollywood Sheet Music? - No, I went to Chico's instead. (laughs) - [Scotty] Oh. (laughs) - I'm going to a new place to sing Sunday. - [Matt] Oh, where? What's it called? - I don't know. - It's a fucking gay bar. - [Lois] It was beautiful. It was like a nightclub, and it felt very strange to be there on a Sunday afternoon. - Yeah, it's a purple lights and everything and-- - But, it was filled with gay guys, and I don't know how to react. I mean, you, you know, I don't care what they do, but I don't like to be in the middle of it, you know. - [Scotty] (laughs) You didn't know. - You know, I'm writing a book about how gays are treated in Hollywood. So, when I came across your book, I mean I was just amazed. - [Scotty] That's a perfect one to ask, right? - Exactly. (laughs) - [Scotty] You know, you're right. - You're revealing a lot, so that was the point. The fact that at that time, studio were trying to secure what was happening with their leads-- - Remember, at that time, many people who were gay had jobs, that they would lose their jobs if they were exposed in any way. After World War II, the vice squad was red-hot in this town. They were picking up guys for nothing. - It wasn't fun, sitting in a gay bar on Melrose in 1962 waiting for the police to raid. They'd go in there and they'd say, &quot;We have a quota of eight for tonight.&quot; And you know, to be beaten up in public parks, or have an effeminate friend viciously attacked going down the street. - It's probably hard for people who were born the last 20, 30, perhaps even 40 years to fully grasp how difficult it was. Not only was it hard for them to find someone to fall in love, but if they tried, they could go to jail, they could go to a institution where they might be castrated or lobotomized. This was a terrible, terrible time for people. - Crush the monster. Crush homosexuality. Homosexuality is, in fact a mental illness, which has reached epidemiological proportions. - When we hear about these stories of people being arrested in the parks, and we think, oh, they must have been such degenerates to be down there having sex in public. But in some cases, you know, they were simply there to meet someone like themselves. Scotty was able to allow these people to have lives that were honest and authentic, which is really what they were seeking. - I think what Scotty did was kind of an introduction service. People wanted something, Scotty would get it for them. Being exploited may be true of prostitution, but that wasn't what Scotty did. It wasn't prostitution. - Oh man! - Hello, baby! (laughs) - This man helped buy this house in the darkest days of my life when motion pictures sucked. If it wasn't for this guy, he, I'd be, I would have sank. - You sweetheart. (laughs) - I love you. - Al, you sweet baby. - You have no idea. He never took a dime of my money. He, he introduced me to some great, nice people, like John Schlessinger. I was the least qualified of all of his boys. But I made a tidy sum, you know? And like Scotty's motto always was, &quot;That's 20 bucks I never had.&quot; And that's his philosophy, and, and that's why he's so successful. - That's right. You, you know, I never took a dime from anyone, right? You bet. - Yeah, never. Never, never, never. There's his book. Oh, is this you, Scott? This photo, that's you! You were posing sometime in the '50s or the '60s. - Yeah, that is me. I remember. Did you like the book at all? Did you read it? - Yeah! Everybody's reading it, and I tell them it's all true. - You know, we were very close, and I fixed him up with a lot of good tricks, didn't I? - You bet, and some bad ones too like Paul Lynde, the drunk. - [Scotty] Oh, remember Paul Lynde? Remember Paul Lynde? - (sighs) Ay-yai-yai. - [Scotty] Jeez, Paul was, Paul was wicked. - And George Cukor, the salivator. (laughs) Yeah, we had some great times. (laughs) You know, I've tried working for pimps and it's horrible. Scotty was never a pimp. He was a friend doing another friend a service and helping both ends. And for that, I really respect him. - [Answering Machine] Time not set. Message two. - [Dian] Hey, Scotty. This is Dian Hanson. Not sure if you remember me. We met at the Benedict Passions and I'd like to talk to you about a book project. We'd like to have you do some writing, I would work with you on it. It involves World War II, so please give me a call. (Scotty whistling) - The Crossroads is (laughs) same as it was, 75 years ago. And, and on a Saturday afternoon, right here there'd be well over 1,000 servicemen in uniform. And this was in 1942, this was during World War II when this took place. - We recently found these photos. A guy contacted me, a huge collection of amateur photos from World War II. And we're gonna make a book about this. I'm thinking of calling it My Buddy, which is named after a song that was popular in World War II. I mean, look at these, walking along, crossing a bridge with their dogs. - [Scotty] Everything and a hat, and the whole bit, and the rifle, and... - [Dian] And then, I found this: a man being consoled when his buddy has been killed. - That's right, and it's got nothing to do with the gay bit at all. It's just buddy-buddy. - [Dian] You offer such a unique resource 'cause you were Marine who was actually there. - I don't know why he, you know, that's not like him. But you can see, it's just falling apart. It's dangerous. Hello. - It was Rod on the phone. That fucking house sold, I gotta get my stuff out of that garage. - [Lois] Oh my God. - Within 10 days. (laughs) I'm young and innocent-looking there, though I wasn't, but. (laughs) What's this? This a picture. Is this a picture too? - [Matt] Can I see? Can I see? Which one are you? - Right here, right there. Here, here, here I am right here. That's my mother's handwriting, I can see. That teacher, Mrs. Ham, Ham, Hammerhand, she was a nice lady who liked a little girl I was going with. I used to fix her up with a girl I was going with because she was a dyke and her brother was gay, and I'd always trick her brother. (laughs) - [Matt] How old were you? - Whatever I was there. When I was 11, yeah, probably. - [Matt] You didn't have any problem with that? - Oh, no, fuck, are you kidding? I never had a problem with that shit at all, baby. (laughs) Never. I was always tricking, even when I was very young, you know, even back on the farm. (birds chirping) (slow soft music) With the Depression being at its full swing, you couldn't make a dime from the farm. And certainly there, it wasn't a lot of food. My brother was two years older and my sister was two years younger. I had a very nice childhood, a good childhood. And that neighbor who had two kids and everything, and his wife was a sweetheart, and he was too, and I couldn't think of anything but nice things about them. Just because he wanted to cuddle me and hold me and jack off me, nothing wrong with that. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that, baby. - [Matt] Many people would consider that child abuse. But you don't think of yourself as abused? - Being abused? Absolutely not. I mean, this is bullshit, Matt. There's no such thing as somebody ruining your life when they suck your cock. The only way that they ruin your life is when they run over you with a bus on the street. That can ruin your life. And even as a little bitty kid, Matt, I never saw anything wrong with anything. You know what, (laughs) I went along with everything. And I never told anybody. (dramatic theatrical music) When we moved to Chicago, my mother and father had divorced, and I ended up later with a stepdad. We moved directly across the street from Holy Angels Church on Oakwood Boulevard in Chicago. We had an old car with a trailer, went loading, and a priest introduced himself, and he, I could tell by the look in his eye, he kind of wanted me, and I'm over there staying all night with him the first night we're there. And I thought, uh-oh, I could pick up a few bucks. Then he proceeded to fix me up with friends. And through him, I'd meet other priests that I would go to their church. Within weeks, I had seen approximately 25 or 30 priests. They'd paid me off in change: penny, nickels, dimes, and quarters. Whatever they got out of the collection box, you know? (laughs) (lively jazz music) I was always out hustling around. And I would go downtown, shining shoes, selling papers, selling rubbers. You know what I mean? I had that going, and the tricking too. And, baby, I had a very good thing going. You know, everybody knew me downtown. Are you kidding? And they'd take me over to their apartment and then, then they had their friends over. - [Matt] Your mother never knew that you were-- - [Scotty] Never picked up, my brother and sister never picked up on it at all. My brother, Donald, did his own little thing in a very square way, never said a word to him. He thought I was selling papers and magazines. I never mentioned a trick to him at any time. Him, my sister, my mother, anybody. My little thing I was doing all by myself. (laughs) (jazzy theatrical music) Many years later, when Dr. Kinsey met me, he'd already heard about me. That's why he interviewed me about four, five or six times. Kinsey was a zoologist, and he started the Institute of Sex Research, Indiana University in Bloomington. - This research has been possible because of tens of thousands of people who have cooperated. - Scotty did play an academic role in the sexual revolution in a way, because he was the connective tissue between the academic Kinsey and the people who were doing it. Scotty was a revelation to Kinsey. - [Scotty] We became friends and he liked interviewing me. I was one of the only people that completed interview from one end to the other, meaning, had done everything. It would always start out by saying, &quot;You ever had sex with a girl?&quot; Yes. What did you do with, you know, doom, doom, doom. How about with a guy? Yes. What did you do? Everything? How about with an animal? Yes. So whatever he had, I did. And I got him, not only the best interviews he had, I took him to gang bang parties and things like that, and put him in a fucking bedroom and everybody fucking, and mainly guys, and then, girls and guys. And, and he'd be over there and I'd crawl over and reach to see if he had a hard-on, and he'd say, &quot;Scotty, I'm just observing, you know that.&quot; (laughs) I think he had a hard-on watching. (jazzy theatrical music) - [Guard] Hi there. - The name is Scott, Ellie Valiant Byron Clark's place. (panting) (people chattering) I do a lot of bartending. That looks full, but it's just the ice that makes it look that. And I started doing it, shortly after the gas station. I left the gas station after about 10 years. You know, the, the station got so busy, and I thought, the vice squad has got to get onto this eventually. There's a vodka. Even though I was in full swing of tricking, people that I knew started, you know, when, I'm having a party, why don't you tend bar for me, things like that. So I proceeded to that. - Read your book. You behaved yourself. (laughs) - The desk needs cleaning, that's true. But in the meantime, I know where things are, and it's not exactly in file, it's just written down on available space. - [Matt] When you were writing down a trick, it was the same thing? - Yeah, but when I was writing down tricks, I didn't, it wasn't lying around. It was in my pocket, and it was for the moment. And the moment that was taken care of, it was torn up and, really torn up and thrown away. You follow what I mean? - [Matt] So you did that because you were worried Confidential might pick it up? - 'Cause they could, those son of a bitches went through garbage and everything, you know what I'm talking about. - [Matt] Confidential? - Oh, yeah. ♪ You got to accentuate the positive ♪ ♪ Eliminate the negative ♪ - [Scotty] There was a paper much like the Enquirer, called Confidential. Confidential was a red-hot thing where they exposed anyone that was well-known that was gay. ♪ You got to spread joy ♪ ♪ Up to the maximum ♪ ♪ Bring gloom down to the minimum ♪ - I am going to file a $25 million libel suit against Confidential Magazine. - If it was written that you were gay in Confidential Magazine, your career was over. - Confidential came as close as you ever could to toppling the whole house of cards here. - [Scotty] Confidential came to me with stories that they had already written and said, you just have to sign the story and say the story is true. They'd hand you an envelope with $1,000 in, and most people would've signed for $1,000. One story was at Frank Sinatra's house in Palm Springs, when I had a three-way with Ava Gardner and Lana Turner. Ava Gardner and Lana Turner, they were buddy-buddy in those days, you know? They were a little stoned, and they were in the pool in the nude, and pretty soon we're in bed together. The word got around. You know how the word gets around? Confidential came to me with a story first, and that's one they wanted me to sign and I wouldn't sign it. After I wouldn't sign it, they grabbed two other guys who signed and went for the money. (slow bluesy music) - He declined to do it. I'm sure he could've used the money. $1,000 was a lot more back then than it is now. But his personal code of honor prevented him from doing that. - Hello, baby. Hi sweetheart. That's a pretty kitty. Just look at that pretty little thing. Chicken dinner, tender chicken dinner. Gotta get some of that. (laughs) Tender chicken dinner for my kitties. Look at the size of that cat food. It's a little bitty thing, and that particular thing was $1.69 plus tax. That's fucking you when they charge you that much for a little bitty can of food like that. I always, when I go over there, I always throw a couple, three in my pocket for my little kitty, you know. And, all she does when you open it is, lick the moisture off of it, eat a couple of little bites, and then I put the rest out for the skunks. Do you want me to show you that picture? - [Matt] Sure. - Baby was a wonderful little doggie that came to the house. She just all of a sudden appeared one day and she was my baby from then on. Oh, here I got a book I wanna show you. This is by Cecil Beaton. He liked to be called Cecil, you know. (laughs) Cecil was very grand, you know. &quot;Don't call me Cee-cil, the name is Sesille.&quot; He's a great photographer, and he photographed the Royal family. And somebody gave me this and I'm in it. There it is, Scotty. &quot;Scotty is a phenomenon. &quot;I heard several years ago &quot;that the police had caught up with him, &quot;that he quit his racket and was out of the running. &quot;This is a blow to me 'cause I'm very fond of him. &quot;But no, Scotty appeared among the bushes &quot;at a Beverly Hills bungalows with his smiling &quot;and trimmed form as ever. &quot;He still continues his nefarious activities.&quot; - [Matt] It's like you were hiding in plain sight. You were always very discreet. - No, but it was just like, Matt, when I took people to see Wally and Edward, I never told one person, even though they were close buddies. And they were seeing the Duke and Duchess. When I met the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, he said, &quot;You came so highly recommended. &quot;Cecil Beaton's told me about you numerous times.&quot; And he said, &quot;I feel that I know you.&quot; - The Duchess and I are actually very glad to set foot in America again. - My friend was a manager of the Beverly Hills Hotel, so I would get a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel for a whole week, and then flood them with people. As you know, the bungalows there, even today, you can walk straight into from the street. It was easy to get people in and out and never ask who was there at all. Two at a time, sometimes three at a time, but usually two at a time. Maybe I'd bring a guy and a girl or both; a girl for her, a guy for him. He'd like to see guys and girls together, and then, sort of work his way in. And when a guy wants to see a guy and girl together, they're usually gay or have tendency of being gay, because if they were straight, why would they want the guy? She's the one that would do the talking. He'd sit there this whole time and not say a word, he was very shy and bashful. She's the one that would say we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, we'll suck his cock. Do this, do that. You know what I mean? I mean, you know, she was a real ballsy chick. But they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them. If Eddie and them were around now, and Ronnie, I might tell them now, now the book is out, &quot;That was, that was them that you saw &quot;at the Beverly Hills Hotel.&quot; (birds chirping) It just, it seems like I just keep adding. You know, I'd come in, I'd throw this there, and this there, and... - [Matt] Do you still work at the desk or is-- - No, I can't get to the desk now. I'll eventually get there again. Look how pretty that tiger is. It just came in, someone brought it in, at Out of the Closet, and I said, &quot;How much?&quot; And he said three bucks. It looks kind of real, doesn't it? - It's horrible. We just can't live like this. It's dangerous. I was talking about getting help, but you can't get help until you cleaned, had the house cleaned out. And one way to do it is to call Social Services. It would be considered elder abuse for him to make it dangerous for me to walk through the house every day. And I can't do that. - All these bags here are new. - [Matt] Do you think that it's compulsive? - You see, if you don't have control, the world will fall apart. And I'm sure the war did this to him. - [Matt] Do you think Scotty could've used some therapy? - No, I don't know that that would've done any good because he doesn't believe in it. But normally that's, should've been with all-- - I'm the one that, I'm the one that gives therapy to people. I don't need therapy. (both laugh) - [Matt] A lot of people would say what you did all your life was wrong. - You're kidding? I mean I, I think it was right. - [Matt] Probably because you were damaged when you were a child. - Oh, yeah, bullshit. I mean, that, that's damage, but hey. (laughs) - [Matt] Someone needed to tell you that you were traumatized. - I did what I did because I wanted to do it and knew what I was doing and it wasn't a case of accidentally or anything. Anything you do, you best better blame yourself and forget that bullshit of coming up and blaming someone else. - But you don't. - No, I don't blame someone else for anything. - [Lois] You don't blame yourself, either. - I don't blame myself. I've done nothing wrong. Why do I blame myself? Today, tomorrow, and forever. Bette and Scotty. - [Matt] You and Bette never married. Did she change her name to Bowers? - Oh, yeah, she changed it to Bowers. When I was in Seattle, before I was discharged, I met Bette in town at the Olympic Hotel. It naturally brings back memories, you know. - [Matt] Good ones or bad ones? - Oh no, they were good ones. Of course, I'd naturally get pictures of Bette like that. (laughs) A lot of romances turn cold as you know what I mean. But at the time it was great. No, Bette was a good Joe. Son of a bitch, she was. It's just a shame that I was not a one-person person. I had too many things to do. If anyone was to blame for not making it work over the years, it was me, because I wasn't a stay-at-home person. You know what I mean? - [Matt] Did she know you were doing tricks? - Even though I didn't sit and discuss it with her, she'd have to know because I was so busy doing that. You know, I bought the house up on St. Andrews for Bette. I'd saved my money from tricking. Stash it away, you know. You gotta see my nice new roof here, baby. In 52 years, it only had two roofs. So this will be the third one. I put this fucking roof on 52 years ago by myself. Bette and I, we just bought the house for $22,000 and she and my little daughter were very excited to come here. We only lived a short distance away from here. I mean, I was always in the neighborhood here. And we-- - [Matt] Did you guys go out to dinner to celebrate? - Oh no, I went out and turned a couple of tricks. I was, you know, I was busy. I didn't do that fucking dinner bit. When you're busy, you're busy. And I was busy every day and every night. I didn't have, which I'm sorry to say, I didn't have time to do that. - [Matt] You're sorry to say? You wished you could have? - Well, I should have, I guess, spent more time with them, which I didn't. I don't know, maybe, maybe I did take her out to dinner on her birthday once. (laughs) Once. Maybe I did once. It was very nice to have a pretty little baby. She was a good girl. This was Donna's little room here. Donna's clothes are still in the closet. And she went to school and never missed a day, and went from grammar school to high school at Hollywood High, and then to college, and finished college, and, and then she died. Here's a picture of her here, too. She had an abortion. And within three or four days after having the abortion, she went into a coma and never came out. She had an abortion by some, obviously, quack doctor back in those days, you know. And she was 23. (slow soft music) And her phone is still there with the same number. (laughs) I didn't go around saying anything. Within an hour after I learned she died, I'm on my way to Malibu to a party with a carload of guys. I was 100% dependable, reliable, whatever you wanna call it, regardless of what it was. None of that bullshit: It's too cold today, it's raining today, or whatever might happen. If I told someone I was gonna be there, I'd be there. I never said anything to anyone about what had happened. - A number of people deal, deal with grief that way. They stay on their regular path, keep your regular routine. (birds chirping) (slow soft music) - I want to get somebody to trim all the trees over there, the bushes over here, this thing. - I'm gonna cut that. - Uh huh. - Soon as my arm is better, I'll cut that. - Yeah, sure. I'm gonna hire somebody. - No you aren't. - Yes I am. - No you aren't. - Yes I am. - [Scotty] Oh, no. Are you kidding? I can do it far better than they can do it. (soft bluesy piano music) - You know, they've asked me why do I stay. 'Cause I love him. And somebody asked me why, and I said, I don't know, it's just, you just do. And, mainly because of the way he is, his sense of humor, his warmth, his caring. You know, they don't just go to the profession he chose years ago, they go into life. He likes to make people happy, but I see it as a terrific need. It must be a chore to have to want everybody to be happy. - [Matt] But you didn't know until the book, to what lengths Scotty went to make people happy. - (laughs) No, no I didn't. (people chattering) - [Woman] Oh my god. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Scotty ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (crowd cheering) - Clever, the way they'd made that phone, wasn't it? (laughs) That was good. I even had a card from my sister as recently as two days ago. From my sister, it says, &quot;Happy birthday, brother. &quot;Remember how I used to tease you &quot;and it really got on your nerves?&quot; And you open that fucking card, it's upside down and it said, &quot;I'm not finished yet, have a good one. &quot;Loads of love, Phyllis and Barney.&quot; (phone ringing) - [Phyllis] Hello? - Hello? - Yeah, hello? - [Scotty] It's me. - [Phyllis] Okay. - How are you? - [Phyllis] I'm, I'm good, George. How are you? - What happened to you? - [Phyllis] Well, I just fell down and they picked me up and I'm over here in the nursing home right now. - But you're going home, though? - [Phyllis] Well, not for a week. - [Scotty] Is there anything you need at all? - [Phyllis] No, not really. Just to hear from you sounded wonderful. - I'll call you back again tomorrow. (phone dialing) Dale. - [Dale] Yeah? - Scotty. Well, you, you mentioned that book, that book, I had forgotten about that book you've talked to me about. - [Dale] Uh-huh. Yeah, Full Service? - Full Service, yeah. - [Dale] Yeah, it was, that was a pretty good book. - Well, hey. Well, don't give it to your mom 'cause it'll upset her. You know what I mean? - [Dale] Oh, no, well, I, I already did. - She's upset over what? - That's why I said, don't show it to her. - [Dale] Yeah. Yeah, I won't show it to her again. - [Scotty] Now don't forget that, okay? - [Dale] No, I won't. - [Scotty] Okay, baby. (people chattering) - Was there ever any discussion about the need for subterfuge and to leave the life in the closet? Or was it just something that everyone knew? - It's just the way it was then. They had to play it very cool, you know? - What, what can you say about, if anything, about Katherine Hepburn? - [Scotty] Katherine Hepburn would've liked you. (group laughs) And Katherine Hepburn was not really nice to Spencer Tracy, you know? - Because? You have any idea why that was? Because he was married, or what? - [Scotty] No. They were merely friends, and they were in business together, show business. And they were not in the bed department together at all. - Never? - Never. (soft theatrical music) All these movie magazines sold a story. And that's why so many square people say, &quot;Oh, I thought they were lovers,&quot; you know. And I said, &quot;Well, they, they weren't, but it sounds good.&quot; - The story of Hepburn and Tracy is one of the best examples of Hollywood crafting a public image. George Cukor directed some of the, the greatest Hepburn/Tracy films. Spencer Tracy lived on the grounds at George Cukor's house, but he was still married to his wife, who, who he loved very much, and there's always been the presumption that he and Hepburn lived together in that little, little cottage. In fact, they did not live together. There was another cottage that, where Hepburn lived. Hepburn in later years tried to make it seem as if they were living in a cottage together sharing a household like man and wife. - Remember that night when, oh, I don't know, you felt so disturbed and I said, &quot;Well, go on in. &quot;Go to bed, I'll talk you to sleep. &quot;I'll just talk and talk and &quot;you'll be so bored, you're bound to drift off.&quot; - It was not that way. They were not living together. They never lived together. (slow soft theatrical music) - She was a designer of her own legend. And she had several fervent relationships with talented other women. She was very guarded about what she did. - [Scotty] George kind of told Katherine Hepburn early in the game what I did, you know, in a way. Then, I could see running it through her head, well if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls too. With a girl, you know what I mean? I could see that. (laughs) I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls. And people says, &quot;How would she see that many?&quot; I said, this was over a period of 39 years, that's almost 50 years. I mean, that's not unusual at all. - [William] The traditional image is that Tracy bullied Hepburn. This was not true. - Ow! What are you doing? - Testing. - She wouldn't have tolerated that kind of behavior from anyone. I began to understand that if, in fact, there were conflicts between Hepburn and Tracy, they went both ways. And she was not happy about his drinking or his friendship with Scotty. Scotty would come down to Cukor's house, specifically to see Spencer Tracy. - I'd get a ride there at five o'clock in the evening. At two o'clock in the morning, I'm still sitting at the kitchen table listening to him talk and going (mumbles), and I'd better go to bed now and he'd get up and almost fall, and he'd put his arm around me and we would go to bed. But then the next morning, he would always say, &quot;Geez, I must've gotten drunk last night. &quot;You were so nice to stay.&quot; Just like nothing ever happened, it was always the same. He really didn't want to be gay, or admit to himself he might possibly be. And so the best way is not to admit it, right? - Uh, (laughs) I can't handle this in my head, it, it rocks me. - The ironic thing is that it was somehow more acceptable to the general public to be in an adulterous relationship than it was to be gay or lesbian. - But the whole thing about being gay in Hollywood, if you played along, you were okay. The studio executives did not really care if someone was gay or not. They only cared about your public persona. You know, in Hollywood, everyone knew that Rock Hudson was gay. - [Announcer] Rock Hudson, selected as the Most Popular Film Actor of the Year. This is the second year in a row that Mr. Hudson has been picked by Modern Screen as Most Popular Actor. - But, his sexuality became really a problem when Life Magazine had done a cover story on him. It said that he was approaching 30 years old and it was about time for him to get married, and if he didn't get married, he needed to tell his fans why. And like, a month or two later, he married his agent's secretary, Phyllis Gates. - [Scotty] And of course, Rock was gay, Phyllis was gay, and nothing happened. - It became kind of an open joke in Hollywood. Everyone kind of knew that this was an arranged marriage, but it was very important to sell that myth. It was about reflecting back a very traditional middle-class, middle America viewpoint. The truth of that was, was something very, very different. (traffic humming) - Oh, that and that's the book? Jesus. Introduction by Scotty Bowers with, with text by Gore Vidal, with James Jones. (laughs) Isn't that... Everything Dian does is you know, she should've designed weapons during World War II. - (laughs) Yeah, right. - I was wondering if you could just start by talking to us about the buddy system, sort of how it worked and why it was created. - When you're in the Marine Corps, the closest thing to you is your buddy, you might say your foxhole buddy, who watches out for you and you watch out for him. - Scotty really had it tough. I mean, he was in three, just horrific battles without much down time, right? I mean, you were fighting four months straight on Guadalcanal. - And Bougainville, two months. - He developed the buddy system in World War II, because they found that the men were able to hold up in battle with a buddy. - Young guys who just left home for the first time to go in the service, the closest thing to you is your buddy, you know what I mean? Your so-called foxhole buddy is the closest thing you have. It's the best friend you have. Service record World War II was put out by Grand Ridge Community. So it was a little town in the area I was born. That's my brother right there. Camp Elliott. Finished training in Hawaii, participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima, lost his life March 4, 1945. My brother was two years older than me. He went in the Marine Corps two years after I did because he was working. He went into Iwo Jima, and on Iwo Jima, we had 7,000 guys killed in 28 days and about 20,000 wounded. (slow somber music) Every time I see some, it reminds me of my brother. (weeps) Every time I see someone, it reminds me of my brother, I liked... (slow somber music) (stammers) It runs through your mind quite often, you know what I mean? You, you don't forget things. Some people forget things, but I don't. It comes back. I have, I still have dreams about it at night. Oh, yeah, you try to put it out of your mind, but it's still there. (slow somber music) It made me fucking happy to be alive. December, well, Beach died December the 7th. They sent the ashes to Pat. He got them, put them in the trunk of his car saying, &quot;We're gonna go up to Beach's and spread the ashes.&quot; And that was six years ago. (laughs) During the war, Pat was in the Navy, Beach was in the Army, and I was in the Marine Corps. We represented all three outfits. (crow bar clamors) Seven years later, and Beach wanted them dumped over the patio, so I'm gonna dump them over the patio here. The wind is blowing a little bit, so I think I'll dump them here. I think I'll just dump them right down here. (slow somber music) If I dump them here, they'll last longer there. You know, you know what this reminds me very much of? Throwing guys overboard, a fucking dead guy's aboard ship, you throw them overboard, just like you do the fucking garbage. Now people think they had burials. Bull shit. You just, you grab one, then another, and then another, and another, you just keep pitching them overboard. And that's what they did in World War II. (somber opera music) My baby Beach's ashes are over the side of the hill where he wanted them. (somber opera music) Yeah, without a doubt, Beach was a good person. A good person, and always very nice to me. (somber opera music) The bad things that happened were: my brother, my daughter, Bette, and the most recent one was my little doggie dying that I loved so much. And you're gonna say that's foolish. It's not foolish. Can you understand how I could love a little doggie or not? - [Matt] I can. - [Scotty] Some people don't, that's why I don't tell them. - [Matt] You've had some pretty terrible things happen in your life. Do you think that you've had to keep busy to not think about] your brother and the others? - [Scotty] Yes, yes, I do. I created happy things, and making people happy to kind of compensate for the unhappy things. Do you think that's possible? - [Matt] That many good years, the late '40s and the '50s were such a glorious time-- - [Scotty] It was a glorious time because nothing bad happened to anyone, you could do as many people as you want and fuck around as much as you want. Things really didn't change along those lines until AIDS came along. (slow somber music) When I think of all the people that I knew, who not only had AIDS, but died of AIDS, I mean, a lot of them, not some, but a lot. And I mean, a lot. Look at, look at Rock Hudson. That AIDS was a very sad thing. Is a very sad thing. (slow soft piano music) Rock was a good friend of mine. He changed so much in appearance, you hardly knew him in a matter of two or three months. I remember when he went off to Paris thinking they're gonna cure him in France or something. - Hollywood was shocked by the Rock Hudson story because there was not really an acknowledgement of the gay scene and the secrecy surrounding his condition. That hit the town like a tidal wave. - This ended the Hollywood myth right there. That, that exposed it as the lie that it was. And Hollywood was never the same again after that. Things changed for Scotty. Scotty was devastated by Rock's death. He was aware that this was a disease that was spreading. AIDS brought a whole new layer of danger and risk to being gay in Hollywood. - When AIDS came along, I thought I'm gonna pass on fixing people up because I don't want to be involved in that. It's a case of, you just hope you don't catch it. - [Matt] Luck. - [Scotty] Luck. That's right. That's exactly what it'd be. It'd have to be just luck, just one of those things. - Honey? He shouldn't be up there. (dog barking) What are you doing? - [Scotty] I'm gonna get over to the ladder and get down. - [Lois] Oh, good. - Jesus, when I think of how I used to be able to maneuver around, now I'm a fucking cripple. My goddamn arm. - [Lois] You shouldn't be doing this. - [Scotty] Wait a minute. (babbles) Fuck, what's the matter with my goddamn legs now? Is it on the thing? - [Lois] Yeah. (Scotty sighs) (ladder rattling) (slow somber music) - Apparently, I had a little bit of a kidney problem from taking Atabrine. Atabrine is for the prevention of malaria. They found out later that everybody that took that, it did damage to their kidneys. - [Matt] You took it during the war? - Took it for three years, yeah. And I should never have taken that shit. Reserved only for who? - [Matt] Volunteer parking. - I'm a fucking volunteer. Fuck it. (laughs) - They do ultrasound every so often to check how the kidneys are. And obviously, they're slowly going, 'cause when it first started it was only 25% loss. You know, then they said, maybe someday we'll have to consider dialysis. And the last time he went they said we have to do it. They wanna put the, like a stent in his arm and, soon. I think he thinks he can buy a kidney someplace. - [Scotty] Lee, how are you, baby? Huh? You sweetheart. (slow soft music) - [Lee] Morning. - You know, Lee and I said, to show you what a buddy is, Lee called me and said he wants to give me a kidney. (laughs) Now is that a buddy? I said you're a real buddy. You're a real buddy, Lee. (garage door rattling) (slow soft piano music) I often think back of how nice things were. I can't think back of any bad scenes or bad things at all. And, and so many people have said the nicest and best time of their whole life was that gas station. And that's why I felt good that I made so many people happy. (laughs) - [Female Reporter] Team coverage, Jay Yamamoto is looking ahead for what is next for gay couples. - [Male Reporter] The decision from the Supreme Court now paves the way to historic change here in California. - The Justices dismissed Proposition 8 and the news sent shockwaves throughout Southern California. (slow soft piano music) (people chattering) - I would say the timing is just about right, now. And when I tell people the gas station days were different, I mean they were completely different. 50 or 60 years ago, this could have never happened, you know that, impossible. - History evolves in incremental steps, and Scotty really was lighting a way forward that we are now embracing where the motto is: Do your own thing. He was doing that when it was not culturally accepted. - You want to wear those clothes? - No, I don't wanna wear this thing, I just want to get married! (dog barks) - We were given a myth, and it's important to show the public that their heroes can be flawed, or their heroes can be complicated, or their heroes can be gay. You know, Scotty holds a mirror up to the culture to help people see the kind of puritanical nature of, not only the culture during the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s, but even to this day. - I think a mistake would be to look at the story of Scotty's being a story of a, you know, gay renegade in a gay world, in a gay subculture. Because, Scotty was pre-gay. He, he himself doesn't conform to any particular label. Scotty just breezes across all the fences that we erect to separate ourselves from others. ♪ Nights are long ♪ ♪ Since you went away ♪ ♪ I think of you ♪ ♪ All through the day ♪ ♪ My buddy ♪ ♪ My buddy ♪ ♪ Nobody quite so true ♪ ♪ Miss your voice ♪ ♪ The touch of your hand ♪ ♪ I hope to know ♪ ♪ That you understand ♪ ♪ My buddy ♪ ♪ My buddy ♪ ♪ Your buddy misses ♪ ♪ You ♪ (audience clapping &amp; cheering) (&quot;The Hut-Sut Song&quot;) ♪ In a town in Sweden by a stream so clear and cool ♪ ♪ Some boys would sit and fish and dream ♪ ♪ When they should've been in school ♪ ♪ They couldn't read or write a word ♪ ♪ But happiness they found ♪ ♪ In a little song they heard ♪ ♪ Here's how it would sound ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And a brawla, brawla soo-it ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And a brawla soo-it ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And a brawla, brawla soo-it ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And a brawla soo-it ♪ ♪ Now the Rawlson is a Swedish town ♪ ♪ The Rillerah is a stream ♪ ♪ The brawla is the boy and girl ♪ ♪ The Hut-Sut is their dream ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And a brawla, brawla soo-it ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And a brawla soo-it ♪ (&quot;The Hut-Sut Song&quot;) ♪ Now the Rawlson is a Swedish town ♪ ♪ The Rillerah is a stream ♪ ♪ The brawla is the boy and girl ♪ ♪ The Hut-Sut is their dream ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And a brawla, brawla soo-it ♪ ♪ Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah ♪ ♪ And brawla soo-it ♪ (moves into soft orchestral music) (soft playful orchestral music)
