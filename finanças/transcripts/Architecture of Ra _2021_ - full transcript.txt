('DISCOVERY' BY TOY INVENTION PLAYS) ('DISCOVERY' BY TOY INVENTION CONTINUES) 2,000 years ago, Antipater of Sidon constructed a list. It was of the greatest monuments that humankind had ever built. He called it the Seven Wonders of the World. He was a Greek poet, and, so, inevitably his list was dominated by Greek constructions. There was the great Statue of Zeus, a temple devoted to Artemis, a colossal statue of the sun god, which was so big that ships could sail between its legs, a lighthouse whose mirror could be aimed at enemy ships and burn them up, the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Tomb of Halicarnassus. But none of these have survived. There was a seventh, though, and it has. And that's despite it being 2,000 years older than the rest. It's called the Great Pyramid. (MAJESTIC MUSIC PLAYS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Of all the incredible things that we humans have built through the ages, this has to go down as the greatest. It was built 4,500 years ago and it still stands, which in itself is remarkable. It has survived massive quakes. It survived being used as a quarry to build mosques in downtown Cairo. And it's been attacked with dynamite. And still it looks magnificent. This is the Great Pyramid, so named because it's the best. The Egyptians built hundreds of pyramids, but King Khufu's surpasses them all. (WIND BLOWS) Truth be told, this project was madness - two million bricks, each weighing twice as much as a car, shimmied into place with pinpoint accuracy. Just getting one of these out of the ground confounds us, let alone raising them 400 feet in the air. And then there's the delicacy with which they handled these stones. This structure is a compass when they had none. And it isn't just within a degree of true North, South, East and West. It's within one-20th of a degree. Perfection. And what we see is just the skeleton. Originally, it was completely encased in limestone blocks. These formed a perfectly smooth skin. And it wasn't this colour either. There's only one pyramid in Egypt which still has its casing stones attached. It's a pyramid built by Khufu's father. Every pyramid was originally encased in another layer of stone. They're called casing stones. But the quality of these stones make them a tempting target for people wanting to build but not wanting to go to the effort of quarrying the stones for themselves. So they were systematically removed from every single pyramid. However, one pyramid, a strange-looking one in remote Dahshur, survived this vandalism. This is Pharaoh Sneferu's Bent Pyramid. It's the only one with the casing stones still attached. FILM CHARACTER: 24,000 feet. (BLIPPING) The Great Pyramid was originally encased in stone like this, so it wasn't the step thing that we see today. Instead, it was smooth, completely smooth. Unfortunately, it's been used as a quarry for thousands of years, and, so, the fine white casing stones have been removed. However, just a few remain near the base. And these tell us something. The gaps between these stones are imperceptible. A razor blade can barely fit between them. They went to these lengths for a good reason. They were chasing an effect. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) When the finished pyramid was seen from a distance, the lines dividing these casing stones dissolved, leaving just a smooth, white, blemish-free pyramid. It didn't look like anything that we'd bump into in nature. Instead, it looked like it was beyond nature. There was one problem, though - they needed a door. This would ruin this perfect effect. To avoid compromise, they invented a new type of door, a pivoting door. Even though this door weighed many tonnes, one strong person could pivot it open. But when it closed, it became invisible. It was so well hidden that when the Arabs first broke into the pyramid in 820 AD, they gave up trying to find this elusive door and instead they bored a 100-foot-long hole into the side of the pyramid. This would have been exhausting. It was solid stone. So, despite working on the opening for months, no-one in the crew noticed that, just 10 metres above them, one of the bricks was different to the rest. That's how well-disguised this door was. ('USKUDARA GIDERIKEN' BY TURKU NOMADS OF THE SILK ROAD PLAYS) When the Great Pyramid was finished, it was a perfect geometric shape, which stood out like a sore thumb in the Saharan sands. It was so unusual, so unnatural, that when Diodorus visited the pyramids around the time of Christ he was moved to say... VOICEOVER: "They do not have the appearance "of being the slow handiwork of men, "but look like a sudden creation, "as though they had been made by some god "and set down bodily in the surrounding sand." This was the heavenly on Earth. That's why they were built with such love and exactitude. The harsh Saharan sun would bounce off the shiny white exteriors, making them visible from outer space. That's exactly what they wanted. The gods would notice this and they'd see that this is beyond the scope of mere mortals, that it had to be their own handiwork. That's the effect they were after. It had to look like the gods made it because it was the gods who were supposed to use it. (EERIE THEREMIN MUSIC PLAYS) FILM CHARACTER: There is the solar reflector. They're signalling us. (BLIPPING) FILM CHARACTER 2: Red alert. Alien spaceship... When the Great Pyramid was finished, it was a pure mathematical shape. Four perfect triangles all rising to a singular point - the summit. And these sides were completely smooth, so there wasn't a blemish or gap in the entire structure. However - however - there were two tiny little chinks in this otherwise perfect skin. They're to be found halfway up the pyramid, one on the north side, the other on the south. But they're impossible to detect because they're just nine inches square and 260 feet up. But why would they go to such effort to create such a perfect mathematical pyramid and then leave these two openings? There had to be a really good reason for them. These openings are the mouths of two very long shafts. They lead all the way to the king's chamber, deep within the pyramid. At first, people assumed they were for ventilation, but this room was thought to be a tomb room for King Khufu. He's dead when he's in this room, so why the need for good air flow? Furthermore, these shafts were very well-built. They're not just a hole bored through the sides. They are a complex construction of massive interlocking stones. They were built using three different masonry styles, plus they were all built at different angles. They're an absolute nightmare to create. There must have been a very good reason for these shafts. And then, in 1888, shafts were discovered in the other chamber, the queen's chamber. These ones definitely weren't for ventilation because they didn't reach the exterior of the pyramid. Recently, little robots were sent up these shafts, and what they discovered was fascinating. They both ran for 65 metres till terminating at two miniature doors. Clearly, these shafts carry some deeply symbolic religious function. FILM CHARACTER: I'm right behind you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) When we moderns look at a structure like the Great Pyramid, we see it as we would some grand monument built for Queen Victoria's jubilee or the coronation of Napoleon. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) We assume that the Great Pyramid was a tribute to the greatness of King Khufu and that's it. But that's not the case. It wasn't just a propaganda piece to declare Khufu's greatness to the world. It was also designed to function as a religious structure. And it's the southern shaft which holds the key to how it worked. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) The main event for this pyramid, the very reason why it was designed, involved this shaft. At noon on November 2, the midday sun is low enough in the skies to align with it. Right this minute, the sun is aligning with that small hole 260 feet up. It's sending a beam of light into the pyramid. This beam of light is cutting through 175 feet of stone until reaching the chamber within. And in that chamber there's only one thing - the sarcophagus. The Egyptians approached their architecture like they did their hieroglyphics - they spelled everything out. And what's happening here is pretty straightforward. The light of the sun god is entering a tomb. We're watching something truly sacred. We're witnessing the sun god being laid to rest. (BOOMING) (ALARM WAILS) FILM CHARACTER: I'm all set. CHARACTER 2: Be careful. (INDISTINCT FILM DIALOGUE) Remember... Yes? ..you'll have only a matter of minutes to effect the transfer. I'll make it. Just hold it steady. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) When the Great Pyramid was sealed, it was in complete darkness for the entire year, except for two brief moments - at the start of the winter and at its end. On these two dates, the sun shone down the southern shaft, and, when it did, the king's chamber was briefly illuminated. These two illuminations connected the sun to this earthly structure and the presence of a coffin within shows what this connection meant. The sun god had come here to die for the winter. It still rose each wintery morning, but it was a shadow of its normal self. So, the Egyptians started to believe that the sun was two separate parts. One part was a golden boat and the other was its captain, the great god Ra. The boat was eternal but each winter, the captain died. This explained why the winter sun was weak and carried no heat. It was just an empty boat sailing through the heavens. (BRAYS) (CAR HORN BEEPS) (MAN SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE) Video. Mm-hm. Having a good time? Yes. (BOTH LAUGH) (SPRUIKER YELLS INDISTINCTLY) Uh-huh.

(LAUGHS) Is that a good price? I can't tell. (LAUGHS) The stones they used to build the Great Pyramid weigh roughly two tonnes each, which is about the weight of a rhinoceros. But the main chamber, the one used to store the sun god, that has stones in it that weigh 50 tonnes. That's about 20 rhinos. And there's about 43 of these granite beams in that chamber, which is a total of 2,500 tonnes, which they had to raise up in the air 180 feet. It... It's staggering what they managed to achieve. And the insanity doesn't stop there. The stones they used to build the bulk of the pyramid came from local quarries. But these heavy granite stones, they came from a long way away. They came from here, Aswan, which is a thousand kilometres away. It's... It's no wonder that people think that the Great Pyramid is humanity's greatest technical achievement, because it's absolutely mind-blowing the lengths they went to to build it. In ancient times, architecture was used to tell a story and it was believed that the better that the story was told the better the structure would function. So, when they built the sun chamber, they chose stones from a place where the sun god was at his most powerful. They chose Aswan. At noon on the summer solstice the sun is exactly overhead here. It's one of the few inhabited places on the planet where this phenomenon occurs. At this moment, objects are casting a shadow... ..shadows of the darkness that follow us humans around wherever we go. But here, at the summer solstice, there are none. The sun is the god of light, and at this one moment in the year the light rules completely. So, the Egyptians reasoned that there was no better place to source the materials for his tomb from than here. They believed that the granite from Aswan was special, that these stones contained some link to the sun god, and this link would somehow help to preserve him through the long winter months. (INAUDIBLE CHATTER) ('SAAT BAQOUL' BY WAEL JASSAR PLAYS) (SAAT BAQOUL BY WAEL JASSAR CONTINUES) (SAAT BAQOUL BY WAEL JASSAR CONTINUES) So, they cut huge slabs of precious red granite out of the Earth and then shipped them a thousand kilometres north. These stones weighed as much as those at Stonehenge, but the ancient Britons only had to raise theirs a few metres high. These ones, though, had to be lifted 60 metres up. The main chamber was built exclusively out of Aswan granite while the rest of the pyramid was constructed out of local limestone. This marked this chamber as special. It was the focus of the entire structure, and it was built for their great sun god. But how could Ra enter this chamber? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Naturally you would think the door of the pyramid, but that's located on the northern side of the pyramid. The sun sails past the southern side, not the northern one. The only way for him to get to his chamber is the tiny opening on the southern side, that nine-inch gap, which guides the sun's light downwards through 175 feet of masonry. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) The sun only aligns with the shaft twice a year. The first alignment is the drop-off and the second is the pick-up. And the amount of time between these two events was precisely 100 days - the length of their winter - and the amount of time that they believed that the sun god was deceased and the amount of time that the sun was stored in this chamber. The Egyptians liked to encode their monuments, kind of like pairing their architecture with its function, believing that this imbued them with extra power, making them more likely to work. So, when they built this chamber, they built it out of stone they shipped all the way from Aswan, which is completely unnecessary in our books, but, for them, essential. They then cut the stone into bricks, huge red granite bricks, and they chose to make this room out of exactly 100 of them. And this encoded the length of the sun god's stay in the room in its architecture, each brick counting off one day of its stay in the room. This was their magic. And it can be read a little like their hieroglyphics. On November 2, the sun aligns with the southern shaft. The chamber within which had been hidden in darkness is briefly lit up. The sun is sending a ray, its life force, into a room made out of sacred solar granite. The sun would be safe here for the winter. The length of its days written in the walls in the number of bricks - 100 days, 100 bricks. And when this time was up, the sun aligned once more, illuminating the pitch-black room again. This signalled that the sun boat had returned to collect its passenger. This moment marked the start of the spring and explained to them why the sun regained its heat after the lengthy winter. Ra was back aboard his boat. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) The Egyptians loved their deities. They had thousands of gods and goddesses. But one deity was revered above all others - the sun god. They called him Ra. He lived in the blue skies of the day, which they imagined to be a great sea. He sailed through this ocean on his golden boat. However, when the weather cooled in the winter and the sun lost its ferocity, they began to believe that their great god Ra had died. This idea makes more sense the further north we go. During a Scottish winter, for example, the trees lose their leaves, the ground freezes and nothing grows. Further north still, in Norway, the sun doesn't even rise above the horizon in their harsh winters. The sun god had to be dead. And so the Vikings wrote tales of the sun god being defeated by the Frost giants. Here in Egypt, Ra's death is less pronounced, but it's still evident the days lose their heat, the nights get cold. They, too, believed that the sun god had died. This didn't mean that the sun ceased to exist, though. His boat still sailed the blue skies each day, it's just that Ra was no longer aboard. This explained why the sun had lost its ferocity. It was still sailing through the skies, but it was just a shadow of itself. The god which they worshipped above all others had died. It's the one thing we feared. It was Khufu's dad who built the Bent Pyramid. He was the true innovator of the family, but no-one's heard of him. Khufu and the Great Pyramid, Khafre and his Sphynx - everyone knows about them. But the genius in this family was Snefru. It was Snefru who wrestled control from a rival dynasty, and, with his ascension to the throne, things changed. His tribe had its own set of beliefs, and he set to forging the Egypt that we know and love. He turned them into the solar worshippers that they're renown for and he also built the first pyramids. In fact, he built for four. Four. And when you consider it takes 20 years to build a pyramid and he only ruled for 30-odd years, that's...that's quite a feat. When we think of pyramids, we like to think of smooth-sided structures. Scholars believe that this was their first attempt at one of these. So, when we see that its angle changes drastically midway up, we think that it's a mistake, assuming that this pyramid was supposed to look like the others. But this was the first of these new style of pyramids. There was no prototype for them to follow. Before this was built, pyramids looked completely different. This was the world's first smooth-sided pyramid. The story that's typically used to explain this unusual state is that structural issues led to a change of plan. They feared that it would collapse, and so they reduced the angle midway through the build. We look at the pyramid next door and then we look at this one. Naturally, we think, "Something went wrong, it's bent, "so he had another go down the road, "and that ended up being his proper tomb. "And as for this one? That's a 20-year exercise in futility." But there's no reason to think that he was trying to put a style of pyramid that did not yet exist. Plus, if these structural anomalies were that bad, then why is this the best preserved of all their pyramids? We think the change in angle midway up is a mistake, but it's not. This pyramid was designed to be this way so it could function as a calendar, an indestructible and incorruptible calendar. The Egyptians used a measure called a cubit, which is about half a metre. This pyramid is 360 cubits long. Their calendar was also 360 days long. Later they added five more days, but these were secret days, days that were hidden from the gods. So their calendar was 360 days and this pyramid was 360 cubits. Snefru had created a giant calendar out of stone. Each cubit of the pyramid's length represented one day. Snefru used architecture to make his pyramid function. The top is built at a shallower angle than the base, so, as you walk up to it, it seems to reduce in size. He used these two angles to trick the eye. The steeper base rears up as you get closer to it, while the top steadily shrinks. At a certain point the top completely disappears, and this moment reveals the viewing point. MAN: Yeah, my friend! I have the two spices shop! Yeah. Australia, I have the two... Yeah, we got it all. Sha' llah! Sha' llah. Show the spices to Australian people. Because Australia, you can't take the spices back, because of the Customs. Ah, yeah. I bring a shai bil-laban. What's that?

Awesome. Like tea mint. Sounds good. Now you open. This film? Yeah. Australian? Australian. Action film? No, no. (LAUGHS) No, it's a documentary. But what were they viewing? In summer, the midday sun is overhead, so it won't be affected by the structure. But as the sun wanes, it drops in the skies. Today is November 2, the start of their winter. The sun has got so low that it's being obscured by the pyramid's base. In the coming days it'll sink into this pyramid. And, as we all know, pyramids are tombs. This calendar functions like their hieroglyphs - it reveals their beliefs step by step in pictures. In summer, the sun is overhead, but as the year progresses, it drops lower and lower in the skies until it eventually slips into the pyramid. It's then hidden by the pyramid's base. And, within that base, there's a chamber designed to store the sun god. Only once it reappears above the pyramid does it emerge from its Earthly tomb. And that took it exactly 100 days. The Egyptians wholeheartedly believed in magic and illusion, so, if the sun APPEARED to be within a tomb for 100 days, then it WAS within it for 100 days. And since tombs are clearly for the deceased, they believed that it was the dead sun god who was stored in this pyramid for the winter. FILM CHARACTER: He was buried alive. Then, thanks to the magic of their powerful priests, somehow life was restored to their great god in the spring. FILM CHARACTER 2: He's alive! It's no coincidence that these dates match those when the sun aligned with the shaft in the Great Pyramid. Both father and son built pyramids to receive and store the dead sun god for the winter. Behind this pyramid, there's another one, a smaller one, but it's not nearly as impressive. These two pyramids were walled in together, meaning they were built at the same time. But the Bent Pyramid was supposed to be their first attempt at a true pyramid, but it's got that kink halfway up. This one, though, doesn't, meaning this is the world's first proper pyramid. The length of the Bent Pyramid matches the solar year, meaning that each cubit of its base stood for one day. The smaller pyramid was built to form a unified complex for the bent one, meaning that they both followed the same code. This pyramid is 100 cubits long, therefore, it represents 100 days. The Egyptians of this remote area believed that the sun god died for 100 days each winter, and, so, Snefru purposely designed this pyramid with the length of 100 cubits so that it would function for these 100 days. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Interesting. SCOTT: (LAUGHS) "Not camel shit." (SPRUIKS INDISTINCTLY) Shukran. Do you call them tea? Yeah. Hot tea. Yes, it's tea. You need water, you know? In the pyramid age, they believed that the sun god died for 100 days each year, and this explained why the Earth was cold in the winter. They built incredible pyramids to store the sun god for this part of the year using innovative lighting phenomena to capture the sun and simple architectural devices to show exactly how long the sun was to be stored within. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Khufu built air shafts to capture the sun's light 100 days apart, and then connected these to the chamber within, which was made out of 100 bricks. These bricks counted off the length of Ra's stay. His father built a Bent Pyramid so that it could illustrate the same belief. The sun sinks into his tomb for the winter. But Snefru didn't build a sun chamber made out of 100 bricks like his son did. No, Pharaoh Snefru was so powerful that he built a separate pyramid to house the sun god for the winter, this 100-cubit-long pyramid. Cheap rice! Cinnamon! Saffron! Hibiscus tea! Black tea!

At the southern edge of Egypt, Ramses ordered his people to build their most ambitious temple in the hottest part of Egypt. Untold thousands would have died building this insanity. And that's the only word that could be used to describe this. It is... It is truly insane. It's a mountain that they transformed into a temple. This is Abu Simbel, the world's most spectacular temple. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) In the 1960s, President Nasser decided to dam the Nile. It was going to boost Egypt's agricultural production and energy supply, but it was also going to submerge this temple. Luckily, UNESCO had recently been formed for just such an emergency. They gathered Europe's finest engineers and came up with a plan to cut this temple into pieces and move it brick by brick to higher ground. But they didn't want to move the entire mountain, so they created a fake one. Ramses' temple has been rebuilt over a giant, hollow hangar. But they did such a good job of reproducing the original that you can hardly tell. We like to think that this temple was an ode to the massive ego of King Ramses. But of course that's our view, because that's how we think. Think of our great buildings, like the Empire State - that's office space for an insurance company. And the Burj Khalifa - that's a hotel. Our great buildings don't hold any hidden depths. But theirs did. They designed this temple so that twice a year the sun will shine in and light up the back wall, and we interpret this as if it was built by someone like Donald Trump, thinking that these two dates must be his inauguration and his birthday. But there are only two days in the year when the sun aligns with this temple, and the odds that one is his coronation and the other is his birthday seem really remote. (CALL TO PRAYER OVER LOUDSPEAKER) Ramses ruled over a thousand years after Khufu and Snefru, and by this stage the Egyptian calendar had changed. It had been simplified into three seasons, each 120 days in length. And they used this one temple to mark each of these season changes. The summer solstice was the end of their harvest season and the start of the flood season. Ramses' architects aligned this temple to the rising point of the belt stars of Orion to work this one out. They could use the heliacal rising of these stars to pinpoint the turning of these seasons. However, determining exactly when the flood season finished and the winter began was tricky. Likewise, finding when the winter ended was tricky. But on these two dates, the start and the end of winter, the sun rose in the exact same spot in the skies, 11 degrees south of east. (CALL TO PRAYER OVER LOUDSPEAKER) So Ramses ordered his workers to cut a 200-foot-long shaft into the side of a mountain. The angle, though, had to be carefully orchestrated so it'll only let the sun peer in on these days. However, since the sun rose in the exact same spot on both these days, only one hole was required. But the angle had to be perfect, it had to be exactly 11 degrees south of east. This temple is a simple calendar but with the most incredible alarm system built into it. It marked the start and the end of the winter season with incredible illuminations that still draw a crowd 3,500 years later. (WOMAN VOCALISES HAUNTINGLY) VOICEOVER: "All the east was a deep rosy flush, "then that paled and a hard white light filled the sky. "Clearer and whiter it grew "till, with a sudden joyous rush, "the sun swung up over the lower ridge of the hill "and in an instant, like an arrow from the bow of Apollo, "one level shaft of light pierced the great hall "and fell in living glory upon the shrine itself."

(SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE) (CAR HORNS BEEP) (TOOTS HORN) (BARKS) (WOLF HOWLS) When Snefru and Khufu built their pyramids, the winter lasted for 100 days each year. King Ramses ruled over a thousand years later, and by this stage the winter had been expanded to last for 120 days. He followed in their footsteps and created a temple which used the sun to mark the start and the end of the winter. (SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE) These illuminations are so impressive, though, that three millennia later they draw thousands of people to this remote temple. They think they're celebrating Ramses' birthday, but they're not. They're witnessing something much more profound. They're watching the death throes of the Egyptian sun god. He was dying, and it was time for him to be interred in his mountain tomb for the winter. SCOTT: I don't think he realises it's not the road. (LAUGHS) He's going the wrong way up the street! Yep. Are supposed to be on this side of the road? See how that side of the road goes that way? Are you... Are you on the right side of the road? Wrong road? No, right road... Alright. But just maybe that one. Over there, like... 'cause that goes that way. Because I think this one just goes this way. I think. Oh, where? On other side? Yeah, it goes that way, I think. Ah, this, yes, yes. Yeah, and this one goes this way. Yeah. I guess it's a bit late now. I don't know. (BOTH LAUGH) But this wasn't all that happened on this date. The light effect also marked time for the locals to inter something. It was time for them to plant their most important crop, the corn, bright golden corn. It's the perfect solar symbol. So, as the golden sun was being laid to rest in a massive mountain, the locals paralleled this by burying golden corn kernels in the ground. This elevated the planting festival to something much more profound. It became a religious event. When the locals planted their corn crop, they was symbolically interring the sun god. The Egyptians needed a structure like this because their calendar was faulty. The Egyptians calculated the year as 365 days long, which is close but not exact. The true year is 365 and a quarter days. We use the same-length year they did, but we know to adjust it with leap years. But they didn't. As a result, their calendar wandered a quarter of a day off the solar reality each year. After a few years, this wasn't a problem, but after a century it really was. By then it had wandered 25 days off. After two centuries it was almost two months off. This was extremely dangerous, especially in a country which had a massive flood each year. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) When the weather warms, it melts the snow in Central Africa. The melting snow gathers in the River Nile and it begins to flood. By the summer solstice, these flooding waters had made it all the way from Tanzania to here. The Egyptian Nile began to rise. And not just by a bit. It turned their lands into a virtual sea. If the farmers followed their calendar with its set planting dates, they'd soon run into some serious issues with the flood. And, so, to fix the problem with the calendar, Ramses built his incredible temple. It illuminated when the planting festival was supposed to take place rather than when their faulty calendar said it should. And this ensured that they only planted the corn crop once the floodwaters had dissipated, and consequently they had the corn out of the ground before the next flood came along to wipe it out. It had nothing to do with Ramses' birthday. Twice a year, the sun streams into this temple, illuminating a group of statues carved into the back wall. It features three popular sun gods, and sitting in between them is the one human, King Ramses. The three sun gods represent the three seasons. Each season, the sun god takes on a different complexion, has different traits and behaves differently. So, Ramses used three different deities to capture the different state of the sun god in each season. For two of these seasons, the sun was considered to be alive. For one, though, for the winter season, the sun was understood to be dead. So, one of these sun gods is different to the rest - Ptah. He was their death god in this era, and he's usually depicted bandaged and looking a deathly green. When the sun peers into this mountain temple, it illuminates the sun gods Amon and Ra but it doesn't light up Ptah. That's because Ptah represents the deceased sun god. The sun's light is life, but Ptah represents the opposite - death. He can never feel the warm glow of the sun's rays. So, only two sun gods are lit up, and Ramses sits between them. He's the odd one out. He's not a god. But he clearly wants to be. FILM CHARACTER: Keep going. Keep on. (EERIE THEREMIN MUSIC PLAYS) The time for Ramses to board the sun boat was when the sun shone into the temple. This was when the sun and the Earth were linked. And in October the sun shone in to drop off its passengers for the winter. This didn't present such a great time for Ramses to try and board the sun boat. But in February the sun shone in to collect its passengers. And this presented him with the perfect opportunity. When the sun gods departed the Earth for the sun boat, theoretically, he could tag along. And upon the entrance of this temple there is an image of what they understood was taking place in this particular dawn. It's an image of one of the sun gods and he's shown striding out of the mountain. This is Ra. It's the only statue in the entire complex which is in motion. He's walking out of the temple upon... ..well, upon nothing, there's just an empty doorway. But, on 22 February, a beam of light shines into the temple, creating a bridge between the Earth and the sun so Ra could simply walk out of here upon the sun beam back to his celestial sun boat. The central statue is Ra. And by his left foot is the goddess Maat. And by his right foot is a dog-headed sceptre called a User. These three words combine to form a hidden spell. They form the throne name of King Ramses - User-Maat-Ra. So, it isn't just Ra walking out of this temple, it's also Ramses. He has fused with the sun god, and together they walk out as one. This amazing statue is the ascension of Ramses to the heavenly sun boat caught in stone. FILM CHARACTER: Attention, flight personnel. Moving elevators are now being withdrawn. Ramses built this temple for his Heb-Sed, which was a ceremony celebrated by pharaohs after they'd ruled for 30 days. During his Heb-Sed, Ramses will be converted from a pharaoh into a fully fledged god. To become this god, he had to do what all pharaohs wished they could do - depart this world and sail aboard the sun boat with the sun gods. He didn't literally depart the Earth during the ceremony, though. Ramses continued to rule Egypt for another 37 years after his Heb-Sed. However, they believed that a part of him did make it aboard the sun boat and thereafter he shone down on the Egyptian people every day. It's amazing... Actually, my shop is special. Not like everyone else. Yeah, it's very different. And my collection is special. Not like everyone. You cannot see this collection of keys...

This lady in the back of the truck. Oh, yes, yes. She's not wearing any sunglasses. How many people do here? Wha! Many people! I don't see it very much. (HORN TOOTS) ('BARN BEAT' BY SOUNDJAY PLAYS) The Egyptians had this odd habit. When their beliefs changed, they didn't just get rid of the old ways, they kept them running alongside the new, and a classic example of this is Abu Simbel. Ramses employed two modes of escape from the Earth. One was to fuse with Ra and together they'd walk off to the heavens on a beam of light. That was the new belief system. The old one is only remembered by a plinth, which stands in front of the row of sun gods. FILM CHARACTER: Attention, please, Luna 3. FILM CHARACTER 2: This is Station Luna 3. Station Luna 3 calling Earth. No signs yet of beings. For the duration of the winter, the sun boat sailed through the heavens without its passengers. But when the winter finally ended, it shone into this temple, and the scene, which the sun saw, revealed what the Egyptians hoped would manifest. The sun had returned to retrieve its passengers, the gods Amon and Ra, and nestled between them sits a hopeful Ramses. In front of these statues stands a plinth, which originally supported a golden boat. From the sun's perspective, it sees itself, the sun boat, and aboard this golden boat are three passengers. This is their version of magic. If the sun boat saw the scene, it would help to make it happen. They wanted the sun boat to retrieve its passengers, the two sun gods, but they also wanted Ramses to be taken as well. It's the temple of Abu Simbel which reveals how the pyramids of old were designed to function. We think these incredible monuments were simply mausoleums for their pharaohs, but they weren't. Instead, they were palaces built on Earth designed to connect with the heavens. That's why the Great Pyramid was built with such exact mathematics encoded into its design and shafts linking it to various stars. Khufu didn't need all this, but Ra did. If Ra was to lay himself to rest in an Earthly structure at the start of the winter, then that structure had to be a worthy palace for the gods. This pyramid wasn't built for Khufu. It was built for the sun god. It was his winter tomb. However, Khufu was inspired to spend decades building it because if he was lucky enough to rule for 30 years he'd be allowed to use it. That's how long he had to reign as pharaoh before he could undergo his Heb-Sed. This incredibly sacred ceremony took place within his pyramid, and during it, if all went to plan, he'd convert from a human into a god. He'd depart this Earth for the heavens, where he'd stand shoulder to shoulder with Ra aboard his sun boat, forever after illuminating and warming the Earth below. And, like Ramses, he employed two different methods to achieve this ascension. When the Greeks thought of their sun god, they imagined him driving through the heavens in a chariot. They had roads, and so they figured that the gods did too. But the Egyptians, they didn't have roads. Instead, they had the Nile. This natural highway meant they could sail whatever they wanted to go. And, so, when they thought of the sun god, they imagined him sailing to the heavens. When Khufu thought of transportation to the heavens, well, naturally, he thought 'boat'. In the 1950s, excavations at the foot of the Great Pyramid revealed a row of granite slabs neatly lined up next to each other. And when they lifted these up, it revealed a giant boat pit, and within was a disassembled boat. It was made up of a staggering 1,200 pieces of wood, and it took 10 painstaking years to piece back together. This was Khufu's mortuary boat. It was 143 feet long. Like many things Egyptian, the design of this boat can be read like hieroglyphics. It's a giant sun dial. Its prow points to the noonday sun in summer, while its stern points to the noonday sun in winter. This oriented the boat. It only functioned as a sun dial when it faced south, therefore, it was designed to sail south. But not south along the Nile - rowing this thing against the current would be a tough ask. Instead, this boat was designed to ferry Khufu south through the heavens. This Earthly sun boat would carry Khufu to the heavenly sun boat. This is a very literal and primitive belief. This boat would physically ferry Khufu to the heavenly sun boat. The Egyptians, though, weren't afraid to have several beliefs running side by side just in case one didn't work. Khufu had a second exit mode. It was the new, improved belief system. A part of Khufu would turn into light and fly up into the heavens. SCOTT: Hello. MAN: Do a camel ride with me? Uh... Camel ride? Yes! Why did the Egyptians build the world's greatest-ever construction? It wasn't just a lavish tomb. It also had to function. It had to assist in the stated afterlife ambition of every pharaoh, namely to sail aboard the sun boat for all eternity. That's what Khufu truly wanted. And, to these ends, he connected the heavens and the Earth in the one incredible structure. So, imagine the pyramid how it was - a white, seamless, mathematical shape. It doesn't seem to fit the Earthly picture. It's too perfect. Instead, this marked it as something godly. And the particular god to whom it was dedicated was their favourite god, Ra. Every year the rays of the dying sun god entered the pyramid. It then stored the sun god for the winter for 100 days. And once this timer was up the sun reached in once more to collect its solar passenger. This was its winter tomb, and it functioned each and every year. But if Khufu ruled for long enough he earned himself the right to include himself in proceedings, much like Ramses had. On the date of his Heb-Sed, a part of Khufu's spirit was taken up from out of the pyramid and into the heavens, hand in hand with the sun god Ra. The Bent Pyramid, Abu Simbel and the Great Pyramid were all designed to store the sun god for the winter each and every year. But the true reason why Khufu, Snefru and Ramses built these monuments was because after 30 years of rule they earned themselves the right to participate in proceedings. These amazing structures enabled them to depart the Earth hand in hand with the sun god so they could join Ra aboard his sun boat and sail in the heavens for all eternity.
