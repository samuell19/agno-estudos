(camera shutter snaps) (melancholic piano music) - As we have discussed previously, Justin is agoraphobic. A condition I've explained and given you information on. But I feel the need to add a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder. - Schizotypal? So just what exactly does that mean? - Ah, schizotypal. It's a mental disorder. Usually appears in late teens and early adulthood, but sometimes it can manifest in childhood. - Okay, so? - Well, a person with schizotypal disorder, they tend to isolate themselves. They may exhibit atypical social behavior patterns and paranoid ideations. - He locks himself in his room, is obsessed with becoming, you know, the world's next Van Gogh. - Does Justin ever leave the house on his own? You know, without coaxing? - He does have an elderly lady he goes and sees often. You know, she's a kind of a crackpot, but nice. She used to be a teacher, so she helps him with his homeschool lessons, and you know, lets him stay there when I'm out. She's one of the few people he feels comfortable with. - How would you characterize yourself as a mother? Are you loving? Nurturing? - This isn't the part of the conversation where you're gonna pull that... "It's all the mother's fault" business, is it? Because if it is, I can tell you, I busted my ass for that kid. I had him when I was 16! And you can't just, no! - Please. Don't misunderstand me. These are important questions, not accusations. The best case scenario is that he will simply outgrow this. He's very healthy, for the most part. He just takes certain behaviors to the extreme. I mean, having interviewed him privately, he has a firm grip on reality. The behaviors he exhibits are just coping mechanisms, to help him work through the things that disturb him and make him quiet. - You said best case scenario. So let's hear the worst. - Okay. Occasionally, and very rarely, schizotypal disorder can progress into schizophrenia. I mean, Justin is eccentric for his age, but he's grounded in reality. Schizophrenics, they lose touch with reality altogether. They hear voices that are very real to them. As real as a conversation you and I are having right now. - So what you're saying is, he's just kind of nuts now, but on his way to being even more nuts? - Please, hear me out. I think we can treat him with cognitive behavior therapy. - Let's go with this worst case scenario. Let's say my son goes bobo loony! Then what? - I know of a wonderful inpatient facility for children with this disorder. - Two grand to get to this point? Shit! - [David] Miss Travers, please. - Let's go! Now! Come on! - Ow, God. - [Deena] Let's go! - [Justin] Take it easy! - Your father was nuts! My mother, your grandmother was nuts! Your Aunt Joanie is nuts, your cousin Suzette, nuts. You don't get to be crazy, Justin. There has to be a normal gene in our gene pool somewhere! - But Mom- - No, you don't get to be crazy, Justin. You just don't. God damn it! - Hurry up, Mom. - I'm coming. Piece of shit. (car doors slam) (somber ambient music) Justin. Justin, wait. I wanna talk to you. (dog barks) Justin! Justin, wait. Wait! I wanna talk to you. Wait! I wanna talk to... Justin. (knocking) Justin! (upbeat band music) I swear to God, you turn that shit down. I have something to say, and you are gonna hear it. Off! Now this is how it's gonna go down tomorrow. I have a lot to do in the afternoon, so I'm gonna let you off at the park. - [Justin] Oh hell no! - Justin! I swear to God, this shit stops. If you continue to behave this way, I'm taking away all your art supplies, all your posters and your iPod. All your traveling, psychology magazines. - [Justin] Go away! - That's it. You open the door right now, or I'm taking it off the hinges. I'm going to get the screwdriver. One, two... Now that's better. Let me see your face. Okay, look, we are gonna take baby steps. You can take your art box and your iPod. I don't expect you to make friends yet, but you can at least be around other kids. You cooperate and you get to keep your door, and all your stuff. Deal? (door slams) Jesus Christ. (calming music) - Vinny. Vinny, are you there? - [Vincent] Greetings, my young protege. Are you having trouble sleeping also? - Yeah. You need sleep? - Of course. Your soul does not lose its need to be replenished. - Oh. - I have been fascinating on something, perhaps you could be of assistance. I'm planning a trip in the future to the Louvre, and I would like to perform, how shall I say, some harmless little pranks? So, shall I tilt the Mona Lisa? Or shall I have security's pants suddenly come loose and fall about his ankles? (Vincent chuckles) - I think you should do both. - Perhaps I shall. what's on your mind, this glooming? - Well, I'm kind of embarrassed to say. - Well, you know you can share your inner most thoughts with me. How does the saying go? Dead men tell no tales. - That's not a saying, it's a book. - Mm. Thank you for the astute correction. But what is concerning you? - Mom's making me go to the park tomorrow. - What could be more delightful than a day at the park for an 11 year old boy? - You know why. - Mm, well. Sometimes we must just face our fears. What would life be like if we never had the courage to attempt anything? - I'm not scared. - [Vincent] Mm, if not trepidation, than what? - I just like it better here with my things, and you. - And I too greatly enjoy our time together, Master Justin. But it remains a curiosity what deters you from seeking the companionship of children your own age. - [Justin] I don't know, it just doesn't feel right. - Justin? (knocking) Justin. - What, Mom? - [Deena] Who the hell are you talking to? - Nobody. - Exactly. Now settle down and go to sleep. - We can converse later, my young protege. But remember, what would life be like if we never had the courage to attempt anything? - Justin, are you going to sleep? - [Justin] How can I go to sleep when you keep yelling? - You're as mouthy as your dad used to be. Justin, remember what I said about all your stuff? I don't wanna hear one more peep. You're gonna go to the park tomorrow, and you're gonna have a wonderful time. Life would be easier if I had a kid I could ground. Justin, let's go! Come on! Could you walk any slower? Let's go, chop chop! Did you remember to bring your inhaler? - Yeah, I got it. - Speak up, Justin. And stop that damn mumbling. I asked you if you brought your inhaler. - What does it matter? You won't be around to see if I have an asthma attack or not. - Don't pull that shit with me, and knock it off with the guilt trip. Do you have it or not? - Are you happy now? - Yeah. (lighthearted radio music) Carla is such a little sweetheart, ugh. You know, she lives close to Aggie. Maybe you could visit her sometime. I bet she gets lonely. - She's a freak. - Why? Because she's handicapped? - No, I don't think she's a freak because she's handicapped. I think she's a freak because she's not handicapped. - What do you mean she's not handicapped? She can't walk, for Christ's sake. - She can walk. - Are you saying she's faking being crippled? - She's not exactly faking it. - What the hell are you talking about then? - She had a conversion reaction. - A what? - A conversion reaction. It's when you don't wanna deal with something, and you don't wanna think about it, and that problem transfers to a physical problem. - Where the hell did you get that garbage? Ugh. (car honks) God damn it. Yards and parks to play in, they gotta run in the street. Anyway, what kind of crap are you talking about? - I read about it in my 21st Psychology magazine. She can walk with the proper therapy. - Proper therapy. Concentrate on your own therapy, Justin. And if I'm gonna continue to give you an allowance, you need to order more age appropriate stuff. And I know with all the crap that's probably building up in your room, I know well that you are playing on Aggie's sympathies. You know, it's not right to let that old lady give you money for a bunch of off the wall shit. - Well, Aggie's smart. She agrees with me about Carla. She told me. - Justin. It is just plain strange that you're an 11 year old boy, and you spend your time gossiping with that old busybody. It's weird. Now, I want you to stay here at least an hour. After that, you can walk home and drop in on Aggie. - Walk home? Why the hell can't you pick me up? - I told you, I have things to do. - Like what? - Like go to the store and fill out job applications. - I don't know my way home. - Justin. You know this neighborhood like the back of your hand. - I think I'm gonna hyperventilate. - Ha! - The hell is so damn funny? - You. You are not getting out of this. Look, there's an empty picnic bench. Take your art box, go sit down, and draw something. - Fine. (car door slams) (kids yelling) (calming radio music) (Deena sighs) - [Woman] Would you like a drink? - [Man] Oh yeah, that's my girl. - [Woman] Oh! (woman moans) - [Man] You stay right... (cell phone buzzes) - Sonny. - [Sonny] Hello, birthday boy. Is this the call to thank me? - Thank you for what? - [Sonny] The birthday gift I sent you. Has it arrived? - No, man. I didn't have time to go to my mailbox. - [Sonny] Oh, it's way too big to fit in your mailbox. It'll be delivered to your front door. - Yeah, whatever man. This chick you hired, she stinks. - [Sonny] Huh? Who stinks? - This.... Sierra Love chick. It's a pain in the ass editing this stuff. - [Sonny] Not enjoying it, kid? - Are you kidding me? She can't act. - [Sonny] Rocket, think about what you doing. - I am. I wrote a good plot with a decent storyline, and this chick blows. - [Sonny] Mm. Isn't that the point? - Screw you, Sonny. Sex is secondary here. - [Sonny] Rocket, you think our fans are looking for a plot? Get a grip. Listen. We're not trying to make Sundance worthy projects here. What the hell's wrong with you, birthday boy? (papers crunching) (knocking) - Who is it? - Open the door and close your eyes, Rocket, sweetie, you're in for a big surprise. (knocking) - Oh, what the hell. Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming. (door slams) - Happy birthday, from Sonny. (party favor beeps) I'm Bambi. What's wrong, handsome? Cat got your tongue? - Yeah, something like that. Sorry, I wasn't expecting company. - Looks like you could use a woman around here to take care of you. You like champagne? - A little early, sweetheart. Well... How long are you gonna be here for? - As long as you want, birthday boy. Sonny said you've got a running tab. His treat. - Good ol' Sonny. - So, what's your pleasure? - You know what would be really sexy? - What's that, handsome? - If you went into the kitchen in that cute little number you're wearing... - Mhm. - Got the sink full of suds- - Oh, I like the way you're thinking. - And did the dishes for me. - Your wish is my command. - Hey, look at this kid. Let's get him. Hey, little girl. What you got in the box? - Loser! - None of your damn business. That's what I got in the box. - Oh man, he means business. - Ooh! - Get away from me! - What's this? Drawing something pretty for your mama? - I don't think she'll like it. How about you start over? - Oh, are you gonna cry? (sink runs) - You're doing a really good job. You'll make a wonderful wife someday. You ever do any modeling? - Oh yeah, all the time. You know, I just got back from Paris on this shoot for the cover of Cosmo. - You got kind of a smart mouth on you. I like that in a lady. Keeps things interesting. (intense music) (kids chattering) (Justin breathes heavily) (Deena sobs) Hey. I know I've been kind of ignoring you, I... - I don't do this. - Don't do? - This. - My son. He's sick. (cell phone rings) (Deena sobs) I think someone is calling. - It can wait. - [Deena] Maybe it's important. - Just one sec. Yeah, Sonny? - [Sonny] Hey, Rocket. You don't have one actress, Leslie Jones? Well, word on the street is that she's 15! - What? How could you let this happen? - [Sonny] It's not my fault! She said she was 21. She looks 21, she acts 21. She gave me her ID. - Jesus Christ. 'Cause nobody's ever used a fake ID before. You shady son of a... You said everything was gonna be above board. No druggies, nobody underage, we're running a legitimate business. Ring any bells? - [Sonny] It is legit! - Have we filmed anything with her yet? - [Sonny] No. - Okay, okay, okay. Good, if she comes by the studio, we'll tell her to kick rocks. I'll head down there right now and do some damage control. Listen, I'm sorry. I gotta... - No, it's fine. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine. - Hey, what's your real name? I know it's not Bambi. - It's Deena. (Rocket exhales) - Aw, you little crybaby. (kids teasing) Are you gonna cry? - Not so fast, you little piece of shit. And the rest of you better not move. What's going on here? Huh? What'd he do to you? Now you skinny little assholes get down on your hands and knees, and pick that shit up. You too. Every damn bit of it. That's better. Now, you little punks, y'all apologize to this young man. I can't hear you. Speak up. - [Kids] Sorry. - Mhm. Now, we're let it go, this time. But if I ever, and I mean ever, witness some shit like this again, I'm gonna go to every single one of your houses and I'm gonna tell your parents what a bunch of little assholes you are. And if they don't whip y'all ass, then I'll gladly do it for 'em. 'Cause Wishbone Devon, he don't really like to tell nobody nothing twice. You got it? I don't think I heard you. - Yes, sir. - Mhm. Get y'all sorry asses home. I walk past here every day, and I don't wanna see y'all ugly faces no time soon. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you pay those kids no mind. Look, they ain't nothing but punks. Just little punks, that's all. Yo, hold up. Ooh! You draw this? - Yes, sir. - Wow. And you didn't trace it or nothing? - [Justin] No, sir. That's cheating. - Wow. What's your name, kid? How old are you? - My name's Justin Travers, and I just turned 11. My mom got me that art box for my birthday. - Well, Mr. Justin, she sure did pick out the right gift. You ever sell any of your drawings? - No, sir. - Could I buy this? - It's ruined. - Oh! That ain't nothing a little Scotch tape can't fix. Look at this, Tania. Isn't this cool? Mm, let's see. How much would you take for it? - Oh, it's okay. If you really like it, you could just have it. - Nope, mm-mm. No, sir. You're gonna be a huge, famous artist one day, and that would be taking advantage of you. Let's see. Well, I'm a little bit short on cash today. Would you take $5 for it? - [Justin] Sure. - Yeah. Hey, you just sold your first piece of artwork. How's that feel? - Good. - Where you live, kid? You want me and Tania to walk you home? - No, it's okay. I just live over on Dowling Street. - Dowling Street, huh? You wouldn't happen to know a lady named Aggie Langford, would you? - Sure, she's a good friend of mine. (Wishbone chuckles) - Well, you just tell her that Wishbone Devon says hello. And kid, you do me a favor. If anybody ever bothers you again, you tell 'em Wishbone Devon will hunt them down and kick they ass. They'll know who I am. Come on, baby. - Hey, Daddy, don't you like any of my drawings? - I love your drawings, baby. - You don't give me any money. - That's 'cause I'm your daddy. You give 'em to me for free. - Oh. - [Wishbone] Oh. (Wishbone chuckles) (engine revs) ♪ Heavy shackles used to hold me down ♪ ♪ Now my feet don't even hit the ground ♪ ♪ Just like a prisoner at a sentencing ♪ ♪ All my dreams are coming true ♪ ♪ I think ♪ (dreamlike music) (Aggie breathes heavily) ♪ Now my dreams are coming true ♪ (dog barks) (knocking) - Oh, hold your horses. Hey, I didn't expect you until tomorrow. - Guess what, Aggie? I went to the park alone. - That's wonderful. - Well, I didn't want to. Mom made me. She said it for my own good. - How did it go? - Well, not so good at first. - [Aggie] Well, what happened? - This group of kids attacked me and broke a bunch of stuff in my art box. - [Aggie] Oh, no. - It's okay, Aggie. This guy that came by the park with his little girl helped me. He even bought one of my drawings for $5. - That's wonderful. - He says he knows you. His name's Wishbone Devon. - Sweet Jesus. Wishbone Devon? Go inside, I got a surprise for you. It was many years ago. He was one of my foster children. Just a little boy, no younger than you. He was a sweet little man. So timid when he first came to me. (Aggie chuckles) Scared of his own shadow. - He sure doesn't act like that now. - You know, I adored that little guy. Then my husband got sick, and the social worker who came by to visit the kids once in a while said it was just too much for me to take care of my husband and the children at the same time. - So, what happened to Wishbone? - Well, you know, he was sent to a foster home, and another and another. I tried to keep tabs on him, but he just got lost in the system. It's just sad how that happens. Well, how about I make you lunch? Or are you full of lemon bars? - No, it's okay. I kinda wanna go home, 'cause I'm working on something. - School work, I hope. You want me to walk with you? - No, I'll be okay. (calming piano music) Mom? Mom, you here? - I'm up here, Justin. I'll be right down. Well, hey you. So, how did it go? - It was okay. - [Deena] What'd you do? - Well, I set up at the bench and I drew. - Well, did you make any friends? - Yeah, a couple. - Well, do you think you might like to go back? - Maybe. Hey, do you know a guy name... (phone rings) - Hang on. Hello? Oh, hi, Gina. You know, actually, I was just thinking about you. I'll call you back, okay? No, I gotta make Justin something to eat. Okay, yeah, no, I'll call you back. Okay, thanks. Bye. All right, yeah, I'll let you know. All right, thanks. Okay, bye. - So, at first I thought he felt sorry for me because of those asshole in the park, but I saw his face, and his little girl's face. - Her name is Tania, and I think they really like my drawings. - Of course they did. How could you feel anything otherwise? Remember who your mentor is. So tell me about this man, your new friend. - Oh. His name is Wishbone. - [Vincent] That's a very curious name. - Well, that's just a nickname. His real name is Clarence. - We feel lonely from time to time, long for people, and sing to ourselves. We should be quite different, and meet a friend and say to ourselves, "This could be the one." But there's much self deception in this longing. If we yield to it too much, it could lead us from the road. - So you think I shouldn't be friends with him? - [Vincent] Quite the contrary. What I'm saying is you should make many friends. - But I don't wanna make a lot of friends. Shh. (calming music) (people chattering) (bell rings) - [Jack] There's a sight for sore eyes. - [Deena] Hi, Jack. - How you been? - Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. - Yeah, how's Justy? - Justin's moody as ever. You know, holed up in his room all the time drawing and dreaming. - Hey, you. How you doin'? Come here, let me buy you a drink. What are you drinking? - Um, you know what? Just a soda. I'm here about a job. - Jack. Can you get her a soda, and put it on my tab, please? - So, how did it go? You know, that problem at your work. - It blew over. It always does. - Well, that's good. - How's your boy? - My boy? - Yeah. He doesn't have cancer, does he? - No, cancer, no. - You said he was sick, I don't know, my head- - Oh, oh, well, he's sick, but he's not sick sick. You know? Not like that, at least. (Justin chuckles) - What kinda homework are you doing? Whatever it is, it sure is making you happy. - Um, science. - Now, mister. You know I have a rule in this house. School work first. And then... Hm. - [Justin] Do you think it's good? - I think it's very good. Who you drawing a picture of? - It's Tania, the little girl from the park. (plates clanging) (catchy instrumental music) - Ah, Tanny. What did daddy tell you about standing on that couch? - It's a balance beam, Daddy. I'm gonna be a gymnast. - Yeah, that's a real fine dream, baby. But you won't be a gymnast if you fall off of there and break your little legs. You said you wanted to be an artist, right? I don't know maybe that's a little safer for you. - I want to do both. - And what do you plan to do with it when you're done? - I was thinking of getting Wishbone's address and sending it to him as a present. - Well, I think that's very sweet, baby. But I also think need to concentrate on your schoolwork at the moment. - I know, I just have one more thing to add. Can I finish it, Aggie? Please? - All right. 15 minutes, and that's it. - Thank you, Aggie. - [Aggie] Mhm. - Hey, Jack. Do you have any jobs open available? I just got laid off. - Oh honey, I'm so sorry. I wish I had known. Missy quit to go to Brooklyn, and I just filled her position this morning, so. But people come and people go, so I tell you what. I'll let you know first thing if something comes up. All right? - All right, thanks. I'm willing to do anything. - You keep your chin up, and I'll check around. - [Deena] Thanks. - Hey, Daddy, what are you making for supper? - Chicken, mashed potatoes, and carrots. - Yuck. I want spaghetti. - Well, future gold medalists, they ain't gonna survive on no spaghetti. Now get down from there. Tania Agnes Devon, you are trying daddy's patience. Now for the last time, quit messing around and get off of that couch! - Okay, Daddy. But I gotta dismount. (intense hiphop music) (gun fires) - Tania. Help! Tania. Tania. Tania. Come on. (Wishbone cries) Tania, come on, baby. Come on, wake up. Come on, baby. Come on. (dramatic music) (heart thumps) - Oh my God! - Somebody help! - Please, somebody help us! Oh my God! (woman sobs) Oh my God. - [Rocket] Let's make a toast. - What are we toasting? - To the future, and to all good things to come. And to Deena and Rocket, who met under the strangest of circumstances. - Is your real name really Rocket? - William. I know, kind of boring. - No, I mean, it's rather digni... Hey, what'd you do to your hand? Oh my God. - I was kind of a klutz as a kid. - A six year old girl has died following a drive-by shooting, officials said. The victim, Tania Devon, was found dead- - Piece of shit. Six years old. - [Reporter] Around 6:30 PM. - Do you know them? - Wishbone and I were friends as kids. - What happened? - Nothing. We both just went our separate ways. Neither one of them good. - Ah, God, this makes me sick. - I gotta get out of here. Take care. - [Reporter] I did speak with the police chief and she said that there were no leads and no suspects at this time, and urged anyone who witnessed the incident or has information, to please contact the department. - Aggie, can you walk me home? - Sure, baby. - Thanks.

What is it that's bothering you, my confidant? - I feel so ashamed. - What is it that shames you? - I didn't do anything. I just feel stupid because I cry a lot. Men shouldn't cry. - Ah. There's no shame in emotions. That's what the creations of the greatest artists are born of. - I guess you're right. (somber music) I don't get why somebody would do that, Aggie. You shouldn't do nothing to nobody. - I know, baby. But, well... It's just a damn shame when someone has to pay for the sins of their father's. - You mean Wishbone? - Oh, no, no. There's an old saying. "Things that happen now started a long time ago." You know, things that got a hold on people. And well, it's very complicated. - Nothing should be complicated enough to kill a little girl. Any asshole should be able to figure that out. - [Aggie] I know, baby. I know. - Aggie. - Hm? - Do you keep things locked up around here? Your door? Do you keep that locked up at night? - Of course. Are you worried about me? Justin, I want you to listen to me. I've lived here my whole adult life. It's never been a very nice neighborhood, but it's my home. Nobody bothered me then, nobody bothers me now. I'm just an old woman with a house full of things that mean nothing to nobody but me. And I refuse to be afraid of the men who were little boys I love. Okay? (Aggie chuckles) I got something for ya. I remembered that you love nostalgia and old photos. And I ran across these the other day. - Is this you? - It sure is. - Wow. How long ago was this? - Oh, it was many, many years ago. I was 18 years old. That's a scene from an off Broadway play in New York City. I was a member of Gabby's Girls. The only African American gal in the bunch. Mhm. - How long were you a dancer? - Well, not long. The love of a man took over the love of dance. - How were the white ladies? Were they nice? - Well, they were very nice at first. I was the underdog, and they took me up under their wings. They were sweet as pie, until they found out how well I could dance. And then I became one of them colored bitches, among other things. (Aggie chuckles) (punching bags thudding) (Wishbone grunts) (Wishbone shouts) - Tyson's at the park. - He there right now? - Right now. - Yeah, right now? - Come on, man. - Let's go. - Get outta here, you punks. Wishbone. Don't do it, man. Don't do it. Remember what the man said? If you're gonna go looking for revenge, you better dig two graves. Do not make things worse than they already are. - How can anything be worse than it already is? Huh? In three days, I got family flying in from New York. And guess what? It ain't gon' be no family reunion. I'm burying my beautiful six year old baby girl, who never did one damn thing, except for try to bring joy to everyone she met. She was trying- - Look, Wishbone. Wishbone, look. Listen to me. Look, I can't even pretend to understand what you're feeling right now. - You got that right. And I hope you never do know how that feels. - Don't do it. Wishbone! Wishbone, don't do it! - [Justin] There's nothing but crap in here. - There's plenty of canned stuff in there. You can microwave something. - [Justin] That's all crap too. God, Mom. It's like you don't even give a shit. - Sometimes you make it hard to give a shit, Justin. - What are you doing there anyway? - I'm trying to pay the bills. - [Justin] What? - Sit down. I want to talk to you about something. Come on, sit down. As soon as I get a job, I'm gonna be working a lot of overtime. - Why? - [Deena] I wanna save as much money as I can. - Why? What are you gonna buy? - [Deena] I'm not gonna buy anything, Justin. As soon as I can get a little bit ahead, we're gonna pack up the truck, and we're getting the hell outta here. - Well, maybe you are, but I'm staying here. - [Deena] Justin. You don't even like it here. I mean, we could go anywhere. We could go somewhere warm somewhere, somewhere peaceful. Some nice little town somewhere. - I said I'm not going anywhere! - Justin. - [Justin] I'll just go live with Aggie. - Justin. I know that you're mad, but you can't live with Aggie. Aggie is an eccentrical lady. You can't live with her the rest of your life. You know, watching old movies and listening to jazz and having her give you the gossip of the neighborhood. That's another reason why I think we should leave. - That "eccentric old lady" as you call her happens to have more class in her little finger than you'll ever have in your entire body. Oh, what's that? You wanna leave off for another town 'cause you used up all the men in this one? (intense music) - Justin! Justin! (intense music) Oh my God, his inhaler. Shit, shit, shit. (tense music) (engine stutters) Shit. Oh, come on, damn it, come on! Shit. (tense music) Um... (phone rings) Oh, come on, Maria. Come on, pick up, pick up. Shit. My God. (tense music) (dog barks) (fire crackles) - You know after she put it down, I gotta go back. I gotta go back. - Get over here, you... - [Man] Get off of him! Let's go! - We had this huge blowout, you know. But he's out there all alone in the dark, and he didn't take his inhaler! - Deena. He just went to cool off, okay? That's what kids do. He'll calm down and come back like nothing ever happened. - No, no, this was different. You know, this wasn't just a little tiff. You know, I wanna call the cops, but he hasn't been gone long enough. - Look, look, look, we'll find him, okay? I won't leave until we do. (sirens blaring) - [Officer] Put the knife down! (radio chatter) - Oh my God, over there! No, a little closer! Please, pull up. - Deena. - No, something may have happened to my kid! (radio chatter) - [Rocket] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - [Deena] No, let go of me! - [Rocket] Wait. - [Deena] Justin? - [Rocket] Deena! - [Deena] Justin? Justin! - Need a 52, code two, for a stabbing victim. - So that was your friend? Wishbone? - Childhood friend, yeah. - Oh my God, his little girl. - Stellie should've kept her mouth shut. - Stellie? - Yeah, Wishbone's wife, ex-wife. - I don't understand. - His little girl, that was a message to Stellie. - What are you talking about? - In my line of work, you hear things. Sonny is the pulse of the grapevine, nosy shit. He tells me things that I'd rather not hear. - Look, I still don't get what you're talking about. - Stellie got pitched. They had her on drugs, dealing. She was gonna go away for a long time, unless she started naming names, and she did. - Why didn't they go after her? Why her kid? - When she disappeared, every Tom, Dick and Harry in this town knew she was somewhere running her mouth. - But what do you mean running her mouth? I mean, yeah, she was trying to save her own ass, but she was doing some good for the neighborhood by turning in those pieces of shit. - You don't turn on your own, Deena. - You sound like you're defending them. - I'm not defending them. I'm not. It's not right, but that's just the way it is. (dogs barking) (motorcycle revs) Deena, hey, hey, hey- - What? What? - Hey, hey. - No, I hear his music. I think he's home. - Okay, he's home. He's safe. (knocking) - Justin. Justin, are you okay? - [Justin] What do you care? - Hey, buddy. My name's William. My friends call me Rocket. Listen. Why don't you open the door, let us in, see that you're okay. Or I could come in. You know, we could talk, man to man. - [Justin] If I let you in, there would only be one man here, and his name is Justin. - What'd I tell you? Kids love me, I know we'd hit it off. - You know what? Don't even worry about it. He's just gonna get himself all worked up all over again. Okay, Justin. I'll leave you be, and we can talk in the morning, okay? All right, good night. - I'll stick around for a little bit, all right? Make sure he doesn't jet. - Okay. Yeah, thanks. - Of course. (drowned out jazz music) - You know, you get a phone call. - I know the drill. Won't be necessary. - Suit yourself. (cell door clangs) - So I'm 17, homeless, sleeping under bridges. I get a job as a dishwasher, cook, some shithole bar. That's when I meet Sonny. Tells me he's in the movie business, asks me what I'm doing wasting my time in a place like this. Says he needs editors, screenwriters, cameramen. I was just some dipshit kid, I bought it. - So, what happened? You know, when you got started at 17. - I mean, he was real slick at first, you know. Had me running errands, shit like that. I didn't know what was going on. Ah, that was stupid. - So when did you, you know, realize what he was really doing? - I think deep down inside, I kinda always knew. - Sure. - For my 18th birthday, he had a woman come over to my apartment. - Oh, geez. (Deena laughs) - Yeah. (melancholic acoustic music) - So here I am, older, not a whole lot wiser. (Justin grunts) (somber acoustic music) (Justin sighs) - Vinny, I'm surprised to see you. I haven't called for you. - I sensed some angst. Could I perhaps be of some comfort? - Well, do you know what happened? - Alas, no. I can only see into your life if you allow me to. A disgruntled artist. You should tell yourself... "I'm seeking, I'm striving, and I mean with all my heart." - Well, it's not that easy. I'm trying to remember something, and it's too bad to talk about. But I can tell you. - So you write screenplays? - Yeah. Even had the nerve to show one to someone. - [Deena] Yeah? - Yeah. He said he was "blown away". He said he was gonna change gears for a while. Produce something reputable for a change. Said he'd use my script. - So did he? - Yeah. He calls me, tells me he's got a surprise for me. It's my script. Now what I wrote was PG, okay? Sonny sends me over some moaning, groaning sex fest. - [Deena] Oh. - With a little bit of my dialogue sprinkled on top. Jesus Christ. I can't believe I ever thought that sleazy bastard would produce anything reputable. - Well, have you shown your stuff to anyone else? - Who am I gonna show, Deena? I edit porn. Nobody's gonna take me seriously. - I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I just have this feeling like, you just never know. (melancholic acoustic music) - It's getting kind of late. - Yeah. - I should get outta here. - Yeah, sure. Thanks for the beer. - Yeah. - [Rocket] Take care. - See ya. - So, I don't know what to do. - Well, I wish I could advise you, but I have little knowledge of the workings of the 21st century. First and foremost though, there is self-preservation. - Well, I have to do something. - Well, remember what I told you in our first encounter? - What would life be if we never had the courage to attend anything? Hey, Mom? - [Deena] Yeah. - Can you pick up newspapers? One of my assignments is on current events. - The convenience store is just a couple blocks down. You can walk down and get one. - But Mom- - No, Justin, come on. Dr. James said you that you were- - Fine, I'll do it. - You were supposed to be getting out to do these things. Here's a couple bucks. I'm gonna be out for a while, so you can go hang out with Aggie. You guys can have a movie night. Bye. (cell doors slamming) - [Man] All y'all knew. - [Judge] Clarence William Devon. You are here charged with first degree murder in the death of Tyus Freemont. How do you plead? - [Wishbone] Guilty. (catchy music) - Aggie. Were you able to dance like that? - I probably thought so. (Aggie chuckles) Oh my goodness, look what time it is. It's my fault, I got you caught up in this movie. But you know what? We still got time for you to do one of your assignments. (Justin sighs) (Aggie chuckles) - [Wishbone] What did daddy tell you about climbing on that couch? - [Tania] It's a balance beam, Daddy. I'm gonna be a gymnast. - [Wishbone] You said you wanted to be an artist, right? - [Tania] I want to do both. - Aggie. - Hi, Justin. I'm sorry to wake you up. You weren't in your room, so I was thinking you might be here. I hope I didn't scare you. I know you've been real, real sad. I just wanna stop by and tell you I'm okay. Justin, can you please do something for me? Can you please tell my daddy I'm okay? He's been real sad. - Do you think you can do it? That might be better. - I can't, Justin. My daddy doesn't believe the same things as you. That's why it wouldn't work. - [Justin] Oh. - My daddy sure did like that picture you drew. He told me if I kept practicing, I'd be as good as the little boy in the park. He bought me an art box like yours for my birthday. It was supposed to be a surprise. I found it. I snooped. I'd be real happy if you'd tell him. - [Justin] Okay. - But don't tell him I found that art box, he'd get mad at me 'cause I was so nosy. - I won't. - One time Daddy told me, "Tania Agnes Devon. You may be only six years old, but you're the nosiest woman I ever did know." - Tania, are you happy? - Mostly, but I'm sad about my daddy. I'd be real happy if he knows I'm all right. - Okay. (calming ambient music) Vinny? - [Vincent] Greetings! - I need to ask you something, it's gonna sound stupid. - Well, the only unintelligent question- - Are you real? - Of course I'm real. Why would you think otherwise? - I was reading up on schizophrenia. "A person hears voices and sometimes sees things." And I saw the little girl, the one that got shot. She seemed so real. - Do you doubt that she was real? - No, that's the point. Schizophrenics believe what they see and hear. I read about it in the issue of the 21st Century Psychology. Maybe I'm just sitting here talking to myself. I'm getting scared. I also read that voices are really nice at first. I don't know what to do. I don't wanna be crazy. - These people, voices that you hear. Are they kind? - Yeah, they're really nice. But that's how it starts. - You have opened your heart, Master Justin. Once you do that, you open yourself to visits from all kinds of kindred spirits. They'll always be kind. They won't visit you if you don't want them to. If you are truly mad, they would continue to come, whether you wanted them to or not. - I just hope I'm not crazy. - Mm. I thought as you did, my protege, that I was mad. But after my demise, I realized I was not mad at all. It was the world around me that was mad. Does that make sense? You're probably too youthful to understand right now, but you will someday. - I'll be back in a minute. Might be a little longer than that if Rosa's working. (Aggie chuckles) You know, she can talk a person's ear off. - Okay. (phone rings) Aggie? (phone rings) Aggie. (phone rings) Hello? - Aggie, it's Wishbone. - Hey, Wishbone. It's Justin Travers. - Oh, I thought I called- - This is Aggie's house. You met me in the park. Aggie went to go get some coffee. I can talk to you until she gets back. - Justin? The little boy from the park? The artist? - [Justin] That's me. - How you been, buddy? - I'm good. Aggie's helping me with my math homework. - Oh, I see. Well, I don't have much time to talk. You draw any more masterpieces? - Yeah, I'm working on something now. It's taking me a really long time. - I'm sure whatever it is, it will be awesome. - I hope so. I'm thinking about entering it into a contest. - Well, I know if I was a judge, I know you'd get my vote. - Thanks. I wanna tell you something, but I don't know if I should. - You can tell me anything, buddies for life. - I saw Tania. - You mean that day at the park? - No, she really came to talk to me. She wanted me to let you know that she's al right. - You mean you had a dream about Tania, huh? - No. Or, kind of. I really saw her. Don't you believe me? - Yeah, look, I believe you buddy. But it was just a dream. A vivid dream. Hey, I appreciate you trying to make me feel better. - I wasn't supposed to tell you something, I promised, but... - What's that? - You bought her an art box just like mine for her birthday. You said if she practiced real hard, she'd become as good as the little boy in the park someday. (melancholic wondrous music) Wishbone? Are you still there? - Hey, look buddy, I gotta go. You tell Aggie I said thank you for letting me add her to my call list. And you take care, okay? (phone slams) (wondrous melancholic music) (Justin sighs) (Wishbone exhales) - What? (people chattering) (bell rings) - What is up, little man? How you doin'? All right. Good to see ya. - My mom needs smokes, sir. - Yeah, she just called. I'll get 'em to you on the sly. I don't wanna get my ass in a jam with anybody. Now, come have a seat. You tell me what's new. - Not much, school lessons. Mom nagging me. Whatever. - You be good to your mama. She's good people. Hey. I usually save those for happy hour, but this is a special occasion. Hey, can we get another round? - Yep, I'm there. (plates clanging) (cell phone buzzes) - What? - [Rocket] Deena? - Hey. - [Rocket] Something wrong? - Oh, no. You know, it's just Justin. I mean, sometimes I think he's a lost cause. I don't wanna get into it. What's up? - [Rocket] I was just thinking about you. I was wondering if you might wanna hang out. - Sure. Yeah, when? - [Rocket] I'm at work, but I'll be home in a bit. You can go over, hang out and wait for me if you want to. My keys are in the bottom of the mailbox. Bring Justin. (Deena laughs) - Yeah, right. What are we gonna do? Make popcorn and watch movies? - [Rocket] Sure. Didn't you say he likes the old stuff? I got a bunch. Cagney, Stewart, Grant. - Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. I'll see you there. - [Rocket] Wanna do the dishes before I get home? - Not funny. - [Rocket] It was a joke, Deena. I gotta run, but I'll see you guys soon. - Okay, I'll see you later. Bye. Hello? Yeah. Hi, Maria. No. Yeah, how's life been treating you since the big layoffs? What? No, I never heard of it. When? Yeah, I mean, that sounds great. Yeah, I mean... Yeah, maybe we could share a place or... Yeah, until we get enough money saved, or yeah, until we drive each other crazy. Yeah, that could work too. (Deena chuckles) Okay. Well look, I'm gonna head out for a bit, but can I call you back in a while? Okay, sounds good. All right. Hey, Maria, thank you. Okay, bye. - Whoa. When'd you get this? - Ah, a couple weeks ago. When Rudy's Bar closed down. (bell rings) Ah. Is this a red letter day or what? Martavious King, you get your ragged ass over here, and give your god-daddy a big hug. (Martavious laughs) All right. Hey. What's this that I have to learn through the grapevine that you're gonna be a daddy? (Martavious laughs) - I'm sorry. I've been meaning to stop by though. - Oh, sure. (Martavious laughs) Hey, sit down. - What's up? - What's this all about Wishbone? Do you know anything? I'm just sick about him. It's really sick. - I don't know. (men chattering) (tense music) (bell rings) (phone beeps) (phone rings) - [Aggie] Hello. You've reached Aggie Langford. I can't take your call right now. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Hey Aggie, it's me. As soon as you get this, could you please come over? It's really important. (tense music) - So you know after she put it down, I gotta go back. I gotta go back. - Get over here. - Get off of him! Let's go! Get up! Let's go! Come on, baby. - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, boy! What you doin'? Come on, man. Devon, we gotta go, man! (tense music) (Justin knocking) - Aggie. (Justin knocking) Aggie! (Justin knocking) Aggie! (melancholic music) Aggie? Aggie? (melancholic music) (Justin shrieks) - It was my time to go. Not yours, baby. - Please wake up, Justin. You're the only one that can help my daddy. - In spite of everything, I will rise again. - [Operator] 9-1-1. What is the address of your emergency? - [Woman] It's Dowling Street. - [Operator] What's going on, ma'am? - It's a little boy, and he's unconscious. It's Mrs. Gladys, I'm his next door neighbor. (siren blares) - [Operator] Is he breathing, ma'am? - I don't think so. Justin. Justin. Come on, stay with me, buddy. Come on. (melancholic music) (siren blares) - Sorry, I was running a little late. I see you found the spare keys all right. What the hell are you doing? You going through my shit? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was waiting here for you, and you didn't show up, and I started reading, and I couldn't stop. I couldn't put it down. William. You're so good. - Stop. - You're so damn good. You should be submitting this to something. - Stop. (melancholic music) - Oh. Oh. The little boy. That was you. - So what, you know me now? - No. - You don't know shit, Deena. (soft piano music) (cell phone buzzes) - Hello? Oh my God. No, no, I will be right there. I'll be right there, thank you. Okay, thank you, bye. - What's wrong? - It's Justin. He's in the hospital. - Come on, I'll go with you. (knocking) - Hey. How you feelin'? Mrs. Layton is here. She brought this for you. They're pictures of Aggie. - I know what it is. - Okay. I have to go out and just run a couple errands. She's gonna stay. She'll be downstairs if you should need anything. Okay? - [Justin] I don't need a babysitter. - Justin, I know. But you just got out of the hospital a couple days ago. So she's here just in case, okay? - Fine. - I won't be gone long. I'll be back to help you with your nebulizer. Okay. And I don't know how I'm gonna tell him, Gladys. I mean, this is just a bad time to pull up and leave. But I have to work, and it's decent money. - Hey, hey, don't worry. Okay? He is a strong little boy. He is. - You know, he loved Aggie so much. You know, I loved her too. I mean, I never even told her that. Do you know I never even said thank you after everything she did for us? - Oh, come on. She knew. And she knew what it was like to struggle. She knew. (wondrous music) (uptempo hiphop music) (knocking) - Yeah? - Martavious King? - That's me. - Can we come in? Ask you a few questions? - [Martavious] About what? - Clarence Devon. - What about him? - He's- - Well, he's run into some unfortunate legal problems, and we thought that maybe you could give us some insight. We'd like you to come down to the station. Just ask you a few questions, you're not in any trouble. - Listen, listen. Without a search warrant, you are not coming in. And without an arrest warrant, I'm not coming out. Have a good day. (door slams) (melancholic music) - Mr. Justin. - [Justin] Hi, Wishbone. I hope you are okay. I'm fine. We're moving in a few days. We're going to California. The factory my mom works at is starting a new one there. I'll send you my new address, and we can be pen pals if you want. I drew a picture for you, and I hope it makes you happy and not sad. It's from the day we met in the park. Your friend, Justin Travers. (melancholic music) (Wishbone sobs) - Hey, David. Would you like to go to lunch with... Oh my goodness. When did you that? This afternoon. It was a gift from one of my younger patients after our last session. He painted it himself. Looks like one of those Vincent van Goghs you love so much. - Right? It was for a thing called the Van Gogh Challenge. Each one of the entrants had to do their own version of a Van Gogh painting and rename it. He chose the Starry Night and called it Charcoal Skies. - Did he win? (David chuckles) - [David] No, he never entered. - Why not? It's amazing. - Yeah, well, he didn't think it was good enough for the competition, but he did think it was good enough for me. You know, there's an interesting story behind the painting of Starry Night. Vincent Willem van Gogh painted it while looking out at an area called Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. He was in a mental institution. And the view from his window was looking east from his room. He loved to paint in the stillness before dawn to calm himself. He didn't like the painting, he wanted to destroy it. But his brother talked him out of it. One of the most famous paintings in the world. (Deena laughs) - Justin. You have to see this. Look at it, it's this video that's going viral. This big hotshot from the Louvre Museum, he was showing some dignitaries around, and he reached up, and his pants fell down around his ankles. You should appreciate this, as much as you love art. (Deena laughs) (wondrous music) (car honks) I'll be right back. (wondrous music) - There she is. - Hi. - So this is it, huh? - Yeah, yeah, I guess we're about set. - How's Justin doing with all of this? - You know, I don't know that he's real happy about it, but he's resigned. You know, he's still gonna see a psychiatrist. Dr. James found me someone in California. - Good, that's good. - Yeah. - I'm glad I got to see you before you left. I got some news. I wanted to tell you face to face. - Wait, wait. What's wrong? - Why something always gotta be wrong, Deena? - Because when someone tells you they need to tell you something face to face, Usually there's something wrong. - No, nothing's wrong. - So what is it? - You ever hear of a film company, "Again With A Feeling"? - Yeah. Yeah, but what does that have to do with anything? - They bought one of my scripts. - Oh my God. For real? - Yeah, for real. What you said to me the other night about being a great screenwriter, it helped me. I submitted a script to an agent. He hooked me up and... - William, you should come out to LA. - LA? - Yeah, I mean, we're gonna be right near there. You'd have all kinds of opportunities, you know? Just the sky's the limit. - I don't know. What about... - What about what? - Well, Sonny. - What about him? - He's not doing so hot. His health, it's failing. I'm all he's ever had, you know? He's all I ever had, Deena. - I mean, he could come with you. It's just never too late, you know. I mean... - Sonny's not gonna move. (somber music) You're an amazing person, Deena. - Well, you know, I'm still really happy for you. I'm gonna tell everyone I know that I'm friends with a big, famous screenwriter. - Take care, Deena. All right? (dramatic music) (door slams) - Well, are you all set? - Yeah. I took one last look around the place, and I got everything. - Okay. You're not gonna take Van Gogh? - No, I think I'll leave him here. He kinda cheers up the place. - Okay. Well, will you help me with these last couple boxes, and then we can head out. I'll lock up. (dog faintly barks) Well, are you ready for this, kiddo? - Yeah, I think so. - I mean, this has been my... Our home, you know, our whole lives. - I know, Mom. But what would life be if we never had the courage to attempt anything?
