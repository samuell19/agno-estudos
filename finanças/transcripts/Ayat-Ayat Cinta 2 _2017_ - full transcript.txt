GAZA, PALESTINE Fahri, Alicia, I have to... Aisha, where are you now? Fahri... Oh, my God! Kabar buruk, Meg. I forgot to read the textbook assigned by Prof. Charlotte. Bagaimana aku bisa lupa? Bagaimana denganmu? Aku juga. Tapi kabar baiknya./ Apa itu? Prof. Charlotte hari ini tidak masuk. Dia tidak masuk?/ Tidak. That's her substitute. Apa yang sedang dia lakukan di sana? Dia sedang pamer. He's a terrorist in a suit. Showing off to us how religious he is. Apa? Don't be fooled by his looks. We're about to be taught by a professor from some underdeveloped country. Masih ada ya orang yang bodoh dan rasis saat ini. Benar, kamu bisa mengerti maksudku. Aku sedang membicarakan kamu, kamu yang bodoh di sini. Selamat siang, teman-teman. Terima kasih telah sabar menunggu saya menyelesaikan sholat. Once again, I apologize for praying in the classroom. Had I done it elsewhere, I would've needed more time. Now... ...raise your hand if you haven't read the textbook assigned by Dr. Charlotte. Meg, apa yang harus kita lakukan? Thank you for your honesty, both of you. Dr. Charlotte requested me... Students who haven't read the book... Kalian bisa meninggalkan kelas ini. Kalian tak perlu meninggalkan kelas. He has no right to tell you to leave. Dia bukan apa-apa, hanya seorang dosen pengganti. Right, I'm just a substitute. But if Prof. Charlotte were here, what would she do? She would ask us to leave the class. Please. Thank you for your respect. After you leave the room, please come back in. Go ahead. Leave the class, and re-enter. Go back to your seats. I've done what Prof. Charlotte asked me to do. But as the teacher in charge... ...I believe you have every right to benefit from the class today. All right. Dia keren sekali. Aku penasaran, apa dia masih sendiri? Ada cincin di jarinya. Hello. Peace be upon you, Hulusi. Peace be upon you, Hoca. I assume your students enjoyed your lecture today. I overheard them talking about you when they walked past me. You're always exaggerating, Hulusi. I'm being serious, Hoca. Pull over, Hulusi. Is that Keira, our neighbor? I believe so. Let's offer her a ride./ I don't think we should, she... Selamat sore, Keira. Saya Fahri. Kita bertetangga. If you're on your way home, we're going that way too. Ya, lalu? We're offering you a ride. I think she's not interested, we'd better... Keira, are you sure? It's not a problem for us... Saya bisa mengurus diri sendiri!/ Dia bisa mengurus dirinya sendiri. Let's go home./ I'm just offering you a ride. Just in case you need it. You'd better leave now, or I'll call the police. Hei, Keira, Fahri is just trying to be kind to you. Why do you... Who knows? Maybe you want to harm me. Keira, I swear to God, I don't want to harm you. Kebiasaan kalian. Using God as an excuse for everything you do. Including your acts of terror and mass murders. Watch your language, Keira./ Calm down, Hulusi. I'm just offering you a ride. If you don't want it, that's fine. Semoga harimu menyenangkan. Hei, Seksi. Mau ke pub bersama kami? Tunggu! Just this time. Are you still playing the violin, Keira? My wife used to play the violin, too. Keira, it would be polite if you... Hey, Jason! Kenapa kamu bersama mereka? Diam! Terima kasih. Terima kasih kembali, Keira! Let it go, Hulusi. Hoca, I never liked those two kids. Their language... Wait, Hoca. Damn homeless. He thinks this house is a shelter? Hei! Kamu tidak boleh tidur di sini. Bangun! Ini bukan tempat penampungan. Tempat penampungan? Kau pikir aku... You think I'm homeless? Oh, my God. Misbah? Fahri! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. Why didn't you tell me that you're coming? I didn't want to trouble you. It's been a while since we were in Al-Azhar, right? Let's talk inside. Hulusi, can you prepare the guest room for Misbah? Sorry, I forgot to introduce you to my assistant. He's from Turkey. His name is Hulusi. Hulusi, the helper?/ Hey, watch your mouth. This house belongs to people who respect each other. For example, I call Fahri "Hoca", because I regard him as my teacher. Sure, Hulusi. Now, bring my backpack inside. Glory be to God, Ri. Where's Aisha? She's fine, right? You must be tired. Let's talk again tomorrow. You should rest. Hulusi will show you the guest room. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. May God forgive us. Follow me. I don't want you to get lost inside the house. Keira! Kamu dengarkan Ibu. Berhenti memainkan biola itu. Mau Ibu apa? Ibu ingin kamu berhenti. Sudah berapa kali Ibu bilang? Aku sudah muak dengan Ibu! Ibu yang sudah muak dengan kelakuanmu. Terserah... Sudahi bermain biolamu. Hulusi. May I ask you something? What's wrong with Fahri? He was so awkward when I asked him about Aisha. Where is she, anyway? You're his friend, you should know. It's been a while since we were last in touch. The last time was when I told him I would visit him here. Are you saying that you only contacted him because you need him? Why is he mad at me? This tea is a great idea. Why waste a nice warm pot of tea? I'd better have a cup. May God forgive us. What in the world... They're crossing the line this time! May God forgive us./ You can go to Prof. Hawker's office... ...and explain why you're here. We've covered all the expenses until you complete your thesis. Thank you, Ri./ You're welcome. Thank God. What are you doing? Nothing. All's well. We belong to God. Hulusi, what did you do to the car?/ Me? I didn't do this. May I remind you what you were hired for?/Enough. Hulusi, can you take the car to a garage? I'll take the bus, I'll be fine. Hoca, please, don't./ No, I'll be fine. Misbah, you can ride with Hulusi... ...familiarize yourself with the neighborhood. Baiklah. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Pada abad ke 9 dan 10. Bahasa Arab menjadi bahasa tulis utama di dunia. Terutama di bidang ilmu pengetahuan. Termasuk tafsir. Sangat ironis. Maaf? Ada yang mau kau sampaikan? Boleh aku bertanya? Kau mengatakan... Islam played an important role in developing... ...the written language and science in Arabic. But, as far as women are concerned... ...they are considered the inferior gender in Islam. Itu pertanyaan yang menyesatkan. Sayangnya... That's off our topic today. Berikan pendapatmu. Aku yakin mereka tidak akan keberatan. Ya, aku juga ingin tahu, benarkah Islam... ...places women on a lower status than men? Just like he said, Professor. Tidak. On the contrary, Islam puts women on a pedestal. There's a phrase in Islam "Heaven lies at the feet of your mother." Aside from that, there are many great women in the history of Islam. For example, Khadijah, the Prophet's wife. Not only was she the first person to accept Islam. She was also a successful business woman. Hold on. I was talking to.../ And Rufaida Al-Aslamia. A nurse and surgeon from Medina. At a time when in Europe... ...all illnesses were considered an incurable curse. Excuse me, I'm.../ And there was Fatima al-Fihri... ...a founder of the first university in Morocco. Have you heard of them? I figured you haven't. As I suspected, you don't read much. You had no right to answer. I was asking Prof. Fahri, not you. You are just like me, you're a student here. I apologize, Prof. Fahri. I was rude to interrupt. May God forgive us. No problem. Your explanation was excellent. Even more proof that Islam has never subjugated women. You can see Prof. Fahri was not angry or offended when I interrupted him. Prof. Fahri! Ya? I was so impressed by your class. Saya buat ini untuk Anda. Kalau Anda tak keberatan. Terima kasih banyak. Kalau Anda suka, akan kubuatkan lebih banyak untuk Anda. Terima kasih. Sampai jumpa. Peace be upon you, Professor. Peace be upon you. No wonder your justification earlier was brilliant. You're a Moslem. Fahri, I'm Hulya. You don't remember? Apa? Yang benar saja? Hulya? You're Uncle Ozan's daughter from Germany? Do you remember now?/ God's Will. So you just sneaked into my class then? I didn't actually mean to do that. But I couldn't help myself when I heard your voice. Sorry./ You haven't changed at all. Still as spontaneous as ever. Even though that's against the rules. That's not entirely true. Since I'm here to survey the university. Survey? I would like to pursue my postgraduate degree here. So it seems you're a favorite Professor here. Someone even baked you a cake. Wait. Senyum. Ayo foto sekali lagi./ Baiklah. Sorry./ Okay. Satu, dua, tiga. Mom and dad asked me to send them your most recent photo. You haven't commented on my intention to pursue my postgraduate degree here. While I study here... I would also like to gain some practical business knowledge. Aside from being a professor, you're also a reputable businessman. You have a restaurant, boutique, and mini-marts all over the place. They aren't mine, Hulya. I'm just fulfilling my responsibility towards Aisha. Wait a minute. Ya, Phillips. Baik, aku ke sana secepatnya. I have to go to the mini-mart, there's something... Okay. I'll go with you. Ayo. My employees are mostly illegal workers who don't have passports or visas. So I employ them and help them complete the required documents. That might take a while, one or two years sometimes. You don't think it's risky to employ problematic people? They're not criminals, Hulya. Even if they were, I believe they can change and fix their lives. Like my assistant, Hulusi. He was a thug in Turkey, but now... There he is. May God forgive us. I'm so sorry, Hoca. I didn't realize. I was driving the car and I saw a man... ...walking and talking to a woman. So I just passed.../ This is Hulya, Hulusi. Aisha's cousin. Perfect. I mean, I just had the car washed and a beautiful woman is here. Perfect./ Thank you, Hulusi. Let's go to the mini-mart./ Sure, Hoca. Let's go, Hulya. Itu dia. Itu dia si Curut. He only steals small items, like chocolates or magazines. See how he moves? So fast. By the time we realize, he's gone. Saya akan buat salinannya dan memberikannya pada polisi. Kalau kamu nanti menangkapnya, hubungi aku. Baiklah. How are you, Mr. Fahri? Did Mr. Phillips tell you? Yesterday, we had a charity event for the orphans here. Of course, it was my idea. If you want to know more about my ideas, I'd be happy to tell you. But it has to be over dinner. And who are you?/ I'm Hulya. Are you applying to work here too?/ No, he brought me here. Are you and Mr. Fahri... She's Aisha's cousin. A cousin, Thank God. Excuse me./ Yes, sir. Hello. Do you have anything to report?/ Our sales are up 60 percent now. Thank God. Now, please check the new shipment from Indonesia. Yes, Sir. Mr. Fahri. I brought you some lunch. It's Malay cuisine, a family recipe. Let me know if you like it, I'll bring you more. I'll take your leave now, Sir. Peace be upon you./ Peace be upon you. Fahri is amazing, Hulusi. In just one day, two women have professed their love to him. Thank God. Lucky are those men who are admired by so many. You are both exaggerating./ No, we're not. I have proof. Campus cake infused with love. And a mini-mart lunch box prepared with love. Where are we going now, Hoca? Could you take me home?/ I thought Hulya is staying with us. Thank you for the invitation that didn't come forth from Fahri yet. I have rented an apartment here. But I can visit your place, right?/ Of course, whenever you like. Thank you. I don't think the Imam was happy with what you did back there. Sorry. You skipped Sura az-Zumar 21 and went straight to Sura Ali Imran 23. Glory be to God. Thank you. Thank you for correcting me. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. No wonder you were Syekh Utsman's favorite student. Go away! This is not a place for beggars like you! It's against our religion to beg at a mosque. What's going on? Stop yelling at her. Why are you treating her this way? She's a beggar. She's an embarrassment to all muslims here. And you're an embarrassment to Indonesians here. This is not about citizenship. It's a sin to beg. It means you're giving up. But you don't need to be rude to her. Simply telling someone to stop begging is not enough. They have a right to a portion of our wealth. You always think you're better than the rest of us. Peace and blessings be upon him./ Peace and blessings be upon him. We should be proud that even in a time of suffering... ...she continues to wear her hijab. She is staying true to her faith. It's true, our religion condemns begging. But as a fellow Muslim, do you have any idea what drove her to this? We have no right to jugde without knowing the facts. I apologize for their behavior. Actually, I'm not a beggar. I sell merchandise, but somebody stole all of it. May God forgive us. You heard her. Now we know why she was driven to this. Peace be upon you./ Wait. This is for you. Please take it. Please pray for my wife, Aisha. Hati-hati. Hulusi! What is it, Hoca?/ Brenda. Uang. Uang. Hei! Lepaskan dia./ Dia harus bayar aku. Aku hanya ambil uangku. Watch her head. Hulusi, please get a pillow and blanket from home. But she already looks comfortable, Hoca. She could freeze to death out here. Hurry up. Sorry, Brenda. Hei, kau. Aku kenal kau. Yeah, it's me again. Hello. Have you found your wife yet? Tak apa, jangan sedih. A lot of women want to marry a good man like you. What is she after? She always comes home drunk. Let's go inside. Everything's fine?/ Everything's fine, Hoca. Granny Catarina. Good morning, Granny. Are your legs still bothering you? Where are you going?/ You're lucky my legs are weak. Otherwise, I would've come after you last night. Taking advantage of an unconscious woman. What do you mean?/ Brenda. She was drunk and I saw what you did to her. You misunderstood./ Fahri, aku dengar kau. Selamat pagi./ Selamat pagi. Fahri, ini punyamu. Thank you for your help last night. Dan maaf, I've caused you trouble so many times. It was my friend's birthday. Once lawyers get together, drinks are always involved. Dan seperti biasa, I can't stop myself while partying. Next time you should be more careful./ Ya, pasti. Sekali lagi terima kasih. Akan kutraktir kau nanti. You don't have to, Brenda./ Aku memaksa. Oke, aku pergi kerja dulu. Sampai jumpa, Nenek. I believe I did misunderstand. Are you going somewhere? Can we give you a ride? I'm going to pray at the synagogue./ Okay. Come with us. Hoca. You're serious about dropping her at the synagogue? Thank you, Fahri. Pray peacefully, Granny. Would you like us to pick you up? No need, Fahri. Thank you. Let's go. May God forgive us. Granny! Amalek! Pergi! What are you doing? They're my neighbors. They're good people. They are Amalek. They don't belong here. Jangan berpikiran sempit seperti itu. Enough! Enough! Go away! Kau tidak diterima di sini. Go away! Why would you refuse to give Granny Catarina a ride, Hulusi? In my opinion, what Hulusi did was right. Did you see how they treat.../ I don't care how they treated us. They have the right to be suspicious. But I'm disappointed that Hulusi treated Granny Catarina in the same way. Granny is a Jew. She is our neighbor. We have to help her. Our Prophet taught us to help our neighbors. Or did you forget? We only fight the Zionism, the injustice. Not the Jewish people as a whole, and definitely not as individuals. If we treat Granny Catarina just like they treated us. Then how are we better than the Zionist in Palestina? So you're okay with what they did to Aisha? Hulusi! I'm sorry, Hoca. I crossed the line. I apologize. I treated Granny Catarina, the way Aisha would want me to. You mean... Aisha chose this neighborhood to make me feel at home, like in Indonesia. Do you know why? Misbah? No, I don't. Because of the multi-ethnicity within this neighborhood. Jews, Catholics, Muslims, and others. Just like home./ Well, not quite. We have The Five Principles back in our country. Whereas, here... The Five Principles are in here. You can find Unity in Diversity wherever you go. After two miscarriages... ...the doctor said it was too risky for Aisha to have another baby. Our dream to have a child was crushed. It broke our hearts. To feel better, she accepted her friend's invitation... ...to visit Alicia in Jordan. Then Alicia asked her if she wanted to be a volunteer... ...for the Palestinian children who became war victims in Gaza. "I'm going to write a novel based on my experience there, Fahri." That's what she said on the phone when she asked for my approval. I went there to meet her. But Israel kept bombing the Gaza Strip. We couldn't meet. And ever since... ...I haven't heard from her. I blame myself, Bah. "There is no might nor power except in God." "There is no might nor power except in God." Hei, kau, berhenti! Berhenti! Apa kalian melihat seorang gembel lewat sini? Dia berpakaian serba hitam dan menggunakan... Memangnya kenapa, Pak? Dia terlihat mengotori jalanan. Did you see her run that way?/ Maybe... Who is she, Hoca? Her name is Sabina. And she will stay here with us. But we don't know who she is, her background... She's alone in this country. She used to live in Eastern Europe. Her husband has passed away. She lost all of her documents and belongings. But.../ We will help her. I know that you're not comfortable accepting our offer. But there's no other option. We'll make sure that you're safe here. We need a housemaid. We're tired of eating canned food every day. Can you cook? Great. You officially work here. What do you think? What do you think, Sabina? If Mr. Fahri could truly use my help... Thank God. Peace be upon you./ Peace be upon you. Hulusi./ Hulya. How are you?/ I'm fine. Welcome. Thank God./ And Hulya... Look, she brought us delicious food that will save our family today. Sabina, come here for a second. I'd like to introduce you to someone. Hulya, this is Sabina. She's a housemaid here. She's Hulya, Aisha's cousin. Aisha is Fahri's wife. Late wife./ That's not certain. Do you want some, Sabina? Don't be shy. Please take some. Thank you. Fahri really is a great person, isn't he? Of course. Just like these kebabs. Real food, without artificial canned ingredients. It's great. Where's Fahri?/ Upstairs. He's upstairs. If Sabina lives here, then I can come more freely. Yes, of course, Hulya./ How about spending the night? I'm just kidding, Fahri. Excuse me. Hulya. I think Granny Catarina is in trouble. Get out! I'm telling you again... Get out of here! Granny. Who is he? Why is he moving you out of your house? He's Baruch, my step son. He wants this house to repay his debts. But he can't just throw you out like this. He sold this house behind my back, Fahri. Hulusi, take Granny to our house. I will talk to Baruch. Please don't, Fahri. He has always caused trouble. He was fired from the Israeli army due to misconduct. Get out! Get out of here! May God forgive us. Hey, watch it! That's not how you treat women, especially your own mother. Who are you? Are you a moslem? I don't want to deal with someone like you. You don't need to be violent. Granny Catarina is my friend. In fact, she's like my own mother. Great. You can take her with you. How much did you sell this house for?/ Why? Granny Catarina will buy it back. She can afford it?/ Tell me whom you sold it to. She will buy it back from that person./ Call him. Discuss the price, and if there's no deal within a week... I don't want to see her face in this house anymore. Granny.../ Thank you, Fahri. But about this house, I can't afford... Please just rest for now, Granny. Granny, this is Sabina. She's a housemaid here. She will help you with whatever you need. Please, don't bother. I can... Considering you're living alone now, you need someone to help you. Please, let us help you. Hi, professor. Bolehkah saya datang ke rumahmu? Saya mau masak untukmu. Linda./ Hai. Maaf, ini tidak mungkin. Terima kasih atas pengertiannya. Aku tidak mengerti. Apa maksudmu? Itu bukan aku. Maaf. Ini bukan dia. Ini aku. Liat ke pintu. Hei!/Hei, pecundang! Tendang bolanya ke sini! I'll make sure this ball hits them on their faces. May God forgive us. Hulusi!/ I'll puncture it right in front of them. Don't do that, Hulusi. Who kicked this ball? Tell me, or I'll puncture it. Kalian? You?/ Ya, Kenapa? Hebat, Hulusi. Threatening a person with a sharp object and destroying someone's property. That will take you straight to jail. It was your brother's fault./ Who started it? I saw the whole thing. You started it. Tell me, or I'll puncture it. You'd better tell your boss to stop spying on his neighbors. Don't act like a hero. We don't need a hero around here. Ayo, teman-teman. Kita main lagi. What the hell... Oh God! May God forgive us. Thank God. Enjoy your dinner, Misbah. Ya, Phillips./ Thank you, Sabina. Baiklah. Tahan dia dulu. Aku segera ke sana. Jadi, ini benar kau, Jason?/ Apa maksudmu? Ini bukan urusanmu. Pergi! Jason, jaga mulutmu!/ Aku tidak peduli! Fahri is the owner of this mini-mart. Could you leave me alone with Jason for a little while? I heard they have the best milkshakes here. Try it. Okay. It's amazing. Try it, Jason. Why are we here? Just take me to the police, I'm not scared. Aku tahu kau anak yang tangguh. But how about your family? Your mother? Imagine how she will feel if you go to jail... ...just for stealing some snacks./ Omong kosong! Ayo berteman, Jason. Sit down. Please. Next time, if you need anything... As long as my mini-mart has it, you're free to take it. Kenapa kau bersikap begitu baik? I don't like having enemies. Especially when they're my neighbors. No, you started it./ What are you talking about? You're all terrorists. You guys killed our father. My father just wanted to buy us some gifts... ...when the bomb blew up in London. Since my father passed away... ...my mother has had to work hard to support us. Keira had to quit her music school. And I got kicked out from my soccer club. Bom bunuh diri al Qaida terjadi di London Seorang meninggal, 1.000 terluka 300 luka parah Dalangnya para pembunuh Ken Bigley Terserah, aku tak peduli!/ Keira, kita tak punya uang. Aku lakukan yang terbaik. Hei, kau!/ Keira, kita belum selesai bicara. Ini semua karena kau! Kau telah merusak hidup kami! Jangan. Jangan mendekat. Aku sudah muak. Someone is looking for you./ Who? Jason. What is this little devil doing here? What happened?/ Keira is in danger. What happened to her? Sudah saya transfer uangnya. Kenapa kita berhenti di sini?/ Kita akan bersenang-senang, Sayang. Ayo, cepat keluar. Ayo. Kami membayarmu dengan sangat mahal. Kami? Apa maksudmu? Jangan takut, Sayang. Kami akan memberikanmu kesenangan. Pengalaman yang tak akan pernah terlupakan. Tidak! Kau tak bisa lakukan ini padaku! Berhenti! Hei! Berhenti! Hei, berhenti! Aku membuat kesalahan besar, Jason. Siapa mereka? Apa pun yang kuberi tahu saat ini, ibu tak boleh tahu. Berjanjilah. Baiklah. Ayo. What is it, Jason? I need to see Fahri right now. Wait a second. Jason is outside. Terima kasih. Fahri... Hei, kau! I'll kill you, bastard! Jason, calm down./ You bastard! Calm down, Jason. I told the man and his friends to bid for her, Jason. I thought you were a good person. Listen to me, Jason. You have to believe me. Please help me, Fahri. After you told us about Keira the other night. Misbah and I started to research the auction on the internet. The only way to save Keira was by becoming a bidder. Hulusi hired three actors to pose as the bidders. Using a fake identity, we succeeded in becoming the highest bidder. Baiklah. Our strategy was to scare Keira. So that she realizes that what she did was very dangerous. It was the only way to save her, Jason. For your sister to learn that she can get what she wants... ...without sacrificing her dignity. Terima kasih, Fahri. But you have to keep this from Keira. She must not know what actually happened. I think you're in too deep Hoca. You spent your money to buy Granny Catarina's house. And more money to free Keira. We should not hope for anything in return when we help people. Aside from God's blessings when we meet Him one day. I hope Aisha also benefits from our efforts... ...if she is truly no longer alive. And if she is, may God keep her under His protection... ...under all circumstances. Until I am given the opportunity to see her again. I'm worried about her whereabouts. Special drinks from Misbah. You wanted the cappucino right?/ Thanks. Black coffee for Hulusi. Water is enough for me. Don't worry about it, Fahri. Hulusi is an expert at ruining the moment. I apologize./ Apology accepted. I'm not talking to you. Ya, ampun. Hai, semua. You guys hang out here, too?/ Yes. I've been wanting to bring you all here. Permisi./ It's ok, Brenda. We have already ordered our drinks./ Don't be shy. Aku yang traktir. Fahri, allow me to repay your kindness. You're a lawyer, right? Ya, itu pekerjaanku sehari-hari. Have you ever handled an illegal immigrant case? Who needs citizenship? You? He was in that position once, but no, it's not for him. Her name is Sabina, she works at our house. Ya, tak masalah. Sepertinya aku bisa bantu. Tapi sebelumnya... Can I order you some drinks with more of a kick? Lalu kita bisa bersenang-senang dan mengobrol. We really don't drink alcohol, Brenda. But please get one for yourself. Kau tahu, David? Yang penting kita tak menjadi orang munafik seperti mereka. In front of people, you guys act so religious. Behind closed doors, you're just as bad as everyone else. Maaf, jaga mulutmu. Dia temanku. Mind your own business./ What? You hurt my friends' feelings. Your friends' masculinity is questionable... ...if you have to defend them. Calm down, Hulusi. May God forgive us. Please forgive my friend. Let's go, Brenda. You think you can just get away with it? Do you think you're great, throwing money at my mother? Do you think you're better than us? You're a teacher at Edinburgh University, right? I am./ I have many friends who teach there. They will gladly crush you at a debate. I don't like to debate. Especially if it's just for the sake of quarrelling. I'm not talking about a quarrel. It will be a scientific debate. To prove that you are in fact garbage. You don't belong in Edinburgh. Are you scared? When? He accepts your challenge. Bravo! Keira B. Walsh? Kau Nadia Varenka? Ya, Keira. Jadi, kapan kita bisa mulai? Mulai?/Kursus biolamu. Kursus biola? Kau serius?/Kau pikir aku bercanda? Tidak mungkin. Bagaimana ini bisa terjadi? Seseorang memberitahuku bahwa kau bertalenta luar biasa. Yang membutuhkan bimbingan. Ya, ampun. This debate will give you a chance to perform. I wouldn't call it a performance. Baruch has turned it into a battle for my reputation. I'm sure he'll try to corner you, make you appear partial. I know. I need prepare for that. Hoca. There's someone here to see you. He's wrong. I'm not here to visit you. I'm here to help you. It wasn't Hulusi who told me, Fahri. I read it here. Benturan Peradaban Then again, if the topic in a debate is about the Middle East conflict... ...you need a woman's perspective too. Accepted. Let's... Hoca, she's waiting for your approval. Sure. Would gladly accept your help. Thank you, Fahri. I already have some books that we can use for reference. Let me see. Hulya. This one is perfect for the debate. Sorry, I fell asleep. Here I've prepared some new material for you. Thanks, Hulya. It's late. Time for me to go home. Let Hulusi.../ Yes, sir! See you soon, Fahri. Peace be upon you./ Peace be upon you. Hulya. This is good. Thanks. Excuse me. I made tea for you. Please have some. Sabina. Tomorrow Brenda will help you get started on your work permit. She will take you to register your fingerprints. Sabina, what's wrong? Thank God. Allow me to rest. I'm ready. Ready?/ Yeah. Your tie. You're not nervous, are you?/ No! No. That's good, Hulya, Thank you. What do you think?/ Perfect. In the name of God. Selamat pagi./ Pagi. Kita semua ada di sini untuk menghadiri sebuah debat... ...tentang konflik yang ada di Timur Tengah... ...dan konflik tentang kemanusiaan. Saya ingin mengundang Dr. Fahri bin Abdullah... ...untuk membicarakan pandangannya tentang konflik tersebut. Terutama mengenai Palestina dan Israel. Dr. Fahri. Terima kasih, Pak. In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful. Manusia diciptakan untuk saling mengenal... ...saling mencintai, dan saling menghormati. Those are the most important human traits. I don't agree with Samuel Huntington's theory. He encouraged people in the world to treat each other like enemies. I agree with a Turkish theologian, Syaikh Badiuzzaman Said Nursi. He said, the worthiest thing to love is love itself. And the thing that deserves the most hatred is hate itself. So if we want to be honest to history and to ourselves... ...there shouldn't be war in this world, for whatever reason. And those are my views on this subject. Thank you. Perhatian. Menurut saya... ...teman kita di sini hanya menentang teori Huntington... ...hanya karena dia seorang Amerika? Atau mungkin karena dia seorang Yahudi? Benar, 'kan? Kau sangat lucu. Debat ini merupakan debat ilmiah. As such, my focus is on textual references... ...theories, and opinions. It doesn't matter if they're American, or Jewish. Even if it was the devil who spoke the truth... ...I would listen and agree with the devil. Thank you. Tn. Baruch, ini debat ilmiah. Dan Anda bukan peserta debat. But I think it's worth mentioning that this self-righteous person... ...is actually an antisemitic. Through humanitarian pretexts, they are funneling money... ...into Palestine to fund the terrorists. He's a smooth talker... ...but in actual fact, he's a terrorist. He's a dangerous terrorist that could destroy the future of our country. He's not an antisemite. Nyonya, saya mohon Anda mengikuti peraturan debat. I am Jewish. I know Dr. Fahri very well. He's not antisemitic. He is anti-violence and against inhumane acts. My voice is hoarse, but I have one important thing to say. Please hear me out. I swear to God and Moses, that Dr. Fahri is a good man. He cares only about humanity, and about love. And when he said, only love deserves to be loved. And only hate deserves to be hated. It's not just a theory for him. He truly practices it and has done so towards me. He did what should've been done by my own son, Mr. Baruch. I'm telling the truth, when I say that the person on the podium... The man you accuse as a terrorist today... ...is, in fact, a man with a golden heart. He loves everyone. Including a Jew who hurt his feelings. This man is like an angel to me. Thank you, Fahri. I'm sorry for causing trouble and disappointing so many people. Don't worry about it, Sabina. How are your hands now? Thank God, they're better. Brenda arrived at the right time. Thank God./ Fahri, can we talk for a moment? Sure. Fahri, aren't you the least bit suspicious? All the immigrants that I've helped dream about this day. But, Sabina? Boom, her fingers are suddenly burnt... ...and she's not able to register fingerprints. I don't understand, Fahri. Selamat In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful It's so hard to find your favorite food in this country. Are these tempe from you? The only way I can compete with pies, brownies, spaghetti, cheesecakes... ...is to bring you Indonesian food. Thank you, Hulya. Is it good? Have you tasted it?/Not yet. Take one. It will taste better with garlic chilli paste. I will try to make that for you./ Can you cook? Sabina's fingers are getting better. So, she can teach me how to cook. I've applied as a postgraduate student. Same major as yours, Philology. You don't mind, do you? No, as long as you are interested in that as major. I wasn't. I thought it was boring. But after I attended your class, it became a very interesting subject. Just like this tempe. Eating it while looking at you makes it taste so much better. Fahri. Thank you. Hulusi? Misbah? Hi, Fahri. Sabina is teaching me how to make your favorite soup. Then I'd better wait outside. Wait. Don't go yet. You have to taste the soup. Just a spoon. In the name of God. Well? Is it good? Sorry. Peace be upon you. Thank God. Baik, Yah. Fahri ada di sini. Sebentar. Father. Hello? Peace be upon you, Uncle. I'm fine, Thank God. Sure, I'll help her. If God wills. All right. Yes, Uncle. Peace be upon you. Yes, Father? Baiklah. Yes, I'm cooking right now, I'll tell him later. Peace be upon you. My father said he's coming to Edinburg next week... ...he wants to meet you. He has always been impressed by you. That's one of the reasons he gave me permission to study here. - What do you think? - Like it? Sure. I would like it if you study here. Not that, Fahri. I'm talking about the soup. Is it good? - Good! - Good? - Good. - Thank God. - Excuse me. - Baiklah. Sabina. He likes it. - Thank God. - Thank you. God, please forgive me. For having to do all this. For lying to my own husband. Fahri, please forgive me. I can't be your wife anymore. Aisha... You're Aisha./No, I'm not, Granny. Aisha. You're Aisha!/ No, I'm not. I'm not Aisha. Swear to God! Swear to God that you're not Aisha. Please, don't say anything to Fahri. But why?/ He must not know that I'm Aisha. Why, Aisha? Why? Because I'm not the Aisha he used to know. How could you lie to Fahri? He's been looking for you all these years. I don't want to be a burden to him. You think Fahri is that superficial? You think he won't accept you simply because of your appearance? I'm only half the woman I used to be. It's better he knows me as Sabina now. You may say you're Sabina. But in your heart, you're still Aisha. Who still loves her husband deeply, true? So how about your feelings? I'm happy to see him happy. Aisha. You have been reported for aiding terrorists. Aiding terrorists? I know you, Fahri. I know that it's a false accusation. But you know... ...how tight the grip of Bowinkle's Foundation is on this campus. May God forgive us. But don't worry. It's not going to affect my recommendation... ...for you to transfer to Oxford. I can guarantee it. Semoga berhasil./ Terima kasih, Professor. It's absurd, accusing someone without evidence. I think Baruch is more suitable to be labelled a terrorist. Hulusi's right. We can't let them accuse you of aiding terrorists. There's nothing we can do./ Why are you giving up like that? It's not fair. My father knows many scholars who are far superior... ...to the Bowinkle Foundation. You should object... Sometimes it's wiser to step back... ...to enable us to jump further. For how long will you keep paying for her lessons with Madame Varenka? Think of it as her scholarship fund. Don't you listen to her practice every night? Is that Keira? Kuat dan bersemangat. Hulya? Brenda! I'm sorry. Tak apa. Kau sangat merindukannya, ya? - You even mistook me for her. - I didn't know that you were coming. Tak apa. Saya tak akan lama. I stopped by to give you some documents... ...that need to be completed by Sabina. We are seeking approval in a way that doesn't require her fingerprints. - Baiklah. - Ya. Sabina, don't forget to fill the documents... ...and call me when you're done. Okay? Okay. - I should go, Fahri. - Thanks, Brenda. Sama-sama. Fahri... When you find the right woman, don't wait too long to marry her. You might break more hearts. Baiklah, sampai jumpa. Maaf, ada perubahan. Bisakah kita ke tempat lain? Ada sesuatu yang mau dikerjakan. - Hai, Hulya. - Hai, Brenda. You changed your mind? I forgot, I have some urgent errands to run. Fahri akan senang sekali melihatmu. Hulya, if you think I'm your rival, you're wrong. Your only rival is his past... ...which will never completely disappear from his heart. Terima kasih, Brenda. Sampai jumpa./Kau juga. Hei, hentikan! Stop right there! Hei. Lepaskan aku! - Keira? - Let me go! Let her go, Hulusi. No, Hoca. We should bring this brat to the police. Go ahead, I'm not scared. I will tell them everything. The police will support me because they hate you too! Hei, Keira, what's wrong with you? We've never done anything to you. Enough! Let her go. Get off me! I don't need your pity. Just report me to the police! Let them put me in jail like you always wanted! If that's what I wanted, I could've made it happen long ago. So you knew she's the culprit? You think I will thank you for not reporting me? Beg you to forgive me? No, Keira. I know the feeling of losing a loved one. The grief that makes you angry at the world. I lost my wife too. She was a victim of the Palestine war. You miss your father? I miss my wife too. Now, go home. Or if vandalizing my car makes you feel better, go ahead. But if it only feeds your hatred and anger, then what's the point? It won't bring them back to life. Hulusi. Misbah. Aisha's tragedy... ...has somehow made you a very important part of our family. We would very much like for you to marry Hulya. Father. What do you think? I'm honored, Uncle. But I think you should ask for Hulya's opinion. What about her postgraduate degree?/ You don't need to worry about that. She can do both at the same time. Ayah, apa tak terlalu cepat?/ Let it be. We don't need to delay the obvious. Right? Seeing the two of you together... ...I'm certain you're perfect for each other. I have no doubt that he will be a good husband to you. Right, Fahri? I'm sorry, are you saying the family has accepted that Aisha is gone for good? We haven't been able to track her at all, Fahri, you know that... We have tried our best to look for her. So, I think it's time... Sorry, Uncle. I can't accept this proposal for now. Fahri, how long will you wait for her? Until we find her, Uncle. Reassure me, Misbah. About what, Fahri? Anything. I'm asking for your advice. I'm sorry if what I'm about to say offends you. Don't fool... Don't fool God. What do you mean? This advice is for myself too. Everything you've been doing all this time... ...who are you doing it for? And why? Is it really for God, or are you finding a way to cope with your grief? If you are simply running from your grief... ...then it's only for you, it's your loss. You're fooling God. But I just want to... I know you mean well. Good intentions are always rewarded. But if your efforts are half-hearted... ...your good intentions will not amount to anything. And the worst part is, the end results won't be anywhere near ideal. May God forgive us. I was wrong. It's time I face the facts and look forward. Forgive me, if I doubted you. I will no longer stop myself from doing... ...something I should've done earlier. Hulya binti Oskan, will you marry me? I will, Fahri. Thank God. Peace be upon you, Fahri. My flight is at 7 pm tonight. You'll pick me up from the airport, right? Of course, Fatimah. I'll be there. I know you will. I will represent our parents, Fahri. They would be so happy to see you start a new life. Peace be upon you./ Peace be upon you. Valid?/Valid. Thank God. You washed up for prayers? Yes. Okay, let's pray together. Are you asking me to wear a hijab, Fahri? But I don't think I could be as perfect as Aisha. Step by step, Hulya. Terima kasih. Selamat menikmati. Bersulang./Bersulang. What are you looking for, Hulya? I'm making tea for Fahri. Here's the tea you're looking for./ I'm looking for the camomile tea. But he loves mint tea. I know. But this time, I want him to try my favorite tea. Do you know where we keep it? The camomile tea? There it is. Thank you, Sabina. Are you ready, Fahri?/ Yes. Come have breakfast with us before you go. I need to get to campus soon, love. Management wants me to complete all the administrative paper work... ...before they issue an official dismissal letter. Eat a little, or at least, have some tea. Your sister's right. Come, let's eat. Okay. In the name of God. What is this?/ Camomile, my favorite tea. Do you like it?/ I like it. Thank you./ You're welcome. Fahri. Beef lungs?/ Right. Okay, give me some. Thank you, Sis./ You're welcome. Sorry, I really have to go now. Let's go, Hulusi. Prof. Charlotte has promised to give me... ...her recommendation letter for us to move to Oxford. Hold on. So romantic. That's my finger, Hulusi. I have to go./ Okay. Peace be upon you./ Peace be upon you. Take care. Peace be upon you. I miss you. Hulya, can I bring this photo home with me? Look who's smiling at herself. Who are you messaging? It must be her new husband. I can feel the love in the air. But tomorrow he'll be free to take me to the airport, right? Sorry? Yes, he will, Fatimah. And tomorrow after we go to airport... Orkestra klasik London Congratulations, Fahri. You're going to be a father. I'm pregnant. Are you serious? Thank God. Hello. Peace be upon you./ Peace be upon you. It's Daddy. Hello. Peace be upon you, it's Daddy. Thank God. They accepted my application. We're moving to Oxford. And they offered me a permanent position. Selamat datang di Universitas Oxford, Fahri. Terima kasih./ Senang bertemu Anda. Terima kasih./ Sama-sama. Anyone for ice cream? Thank God. Thank you, honey. You're welcome. Why are you laughing?/ Look. The baby keeps moving. Let's name him Umar. What do you think? I like it. Peace be upon you, Umar./ Peace be upon you. Be healthy./ Amin. Mari kita sambut Keira B. Walsh. Senang bertemu denganmu. Kau cantik sekali./Terima kasih. Silakan duduk. God's Will. Is that Keira? Yes, it is. Menurutku, penonton juga pasti setuju... ...kau punya masa depan yang cerah dengan kemampuanmu. Aku hanya beruntung. Ada malaikat yang selalu mengawasiku. Malaikat penjaga yang mengirimiku seorang guru biola... ...Madam Varenka. Siapa pun itu, aku sangat bersyukur. Jadi, Keira. Jika malaikat pelindungmu menonton acara ini sekarang... ...apa yang akan kamu katakan padanya? Aku ingin malaikat pelindungku tahu... ...jika dia seorang perempuan... ...kita akan bersaudara selamanya. Jika malaikat pelindungku seorang lelaki... ...aku akan menikahimu, berapa pun usiamu. Ya, aku akan menikahimu. Pria itu pasti sangat beruntung. Hadirin, inilah Kiera B. Walsh. Keira? Must be the wrong address. Keira, wait! Ini tak mungkin./ Keira, tenanglah. Keira!/ This is impossible. I asked Madame Varenka to send you here. Tidak apa-apa. Come inside. Fahri never told you about this all this time... ...because he knew you would misunderstand and refuse his help. Why did you do all this? I don't deserve your help. Keira.../ I truly don't deserve it. Ya, ampun. Apa yang telah kulakukan. Aku sangat bodoh. Keira. Please stop. Tidak apa-apa. Tolong maafkan aku, Fahri. Tidak apa-apa, Keira. You have saved my life and Jason's, Fahri. No, Keira. You both saved your own lives. If you hadn't taken your lessons seriously with Madame Varenka... ...you wouldn't be where you are. Tidak apa-apa. It's okay. Marry me, Fahri. I beg you, Fahri. I made a promise, marry me. Keira.../ Hulya... Hulya, I'm begging you. It's the only way I can repay him./ Keira, listen to me. Please, Hulya. Fahri made my dreams come true. Each and every dream. Please, Hulya. Keira, listen to me. Take back your words. Marriage is not a payment for somebody's favor. You have the right to marry someone you love and who loves you back. Take back your promise, Keira. Focus on your dream to become the best violin player in the world. If you're successful, I will be happy. And so will Hulya. Forgive me, Hulya. Forgive me, Fahri. Forgive me, Fahri. Forgive me. Fahri, we need to use the toilet. 30 pounds, Nomor 5. Terima kasih./ Semoga harimu menyenangkan. Peace be upon you, Hulusi. Hello? Peace be upon you, Hoca. Yesterday, a man called He said he is a good friend of yours from Egypt. A good friend?/ Yes. He said he misses you and wants to see you. So I gave him your address in Oxford. What's his name? We should buy flowers. May God forgive us./ Bahadur? Who are you?/ Hulya, run. How do you know me?/ Tell Fahri that Bahadur is here, hurry! Who is Fahri to you? Hulya! Tolong! Hulya, run! Run. Aisha? You're Aisha! No, I'm not./ Tolong! Sabina! Hulya. Hulya! Tolong! Tolong! Siapa pun tolong kami! Tolong! Siapa pun tolong kami! Tolong kami! You have to pay for all my miserable years in prison, Fahri. Tolong! Jangan bergerak! Letakkan senjatamu! Fahri, Hulya. Aisha. Aisha. Aisha? Aisha. Aisha, stop! I'm not Aisha. Please don't touch me. I'm not Aisha. Don't. Please don't do that. I'm not Aisha. May God forgive us. How could I have been so blind? I didn't recognize my own wife. Please forgive me, Fahri. Forgive all my mistakes. Why did you do all this, Aisha? I just wanted to make sure that you move on... I just wanted to see you happy, Fahri. But why? Why did it have to be this way? Because I can no longer be your wife. I'm not the Aisha that you knew. I'm broken, Fahri. I'm broken. It's your turn next. I can't wait to enjoy what's hidden under your gown. Jangan! Bawa dia! Lepaskan dia! Jangan! Kamu selanjutnya!/ Lepaskan! Lepaskan! I didn't want them to get... ...what was left of my dignity and my honor. I destroyed everything they might have wanted from me. Are you out of your mind? Crazy! They were mad. They were mad and tortured me. May God forgive us. Forgive me, my love. Please forgive me. Forgive me, my love. There is no might nor power except in God."

He's an expert in facial reconstruction based on a reference. Seeing you happy will make me happy too. And that's a blessing for me. Please take care of Fahri... And raise Umar as your own child.
