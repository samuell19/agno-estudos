As governor of this great state, sometimes I'm forced to make difficult choices, for which there are no clear-cut solutions. Given the crisis we are now facing, with the rapid multiplication of the medfly, I am hereby ordering the spraying of the chemical pesticide Phythyon... Governor! ...in order to save our crops. Governor! I am Dr. Hiro Fujimoto of Animal Research Institute and I must respectfully point out that my studies have shown Phythyon not only to be potentially dangerous with respect to any animals that it may come into contact with, but... to certain types of insects as well. I have reason to believe that chemical can lead to abnormal and hyper-accelerated growth rates and even potential mutations-- Dr. Fujimoto, while I am completely familiar with the possible dangers of spraying with Phythyon, the risks of not spraying are far greater. We could lose our entire food crops from one end of the state to another putting thousands of workers out of a job. Now I ask you, Doctor, what could possibly be worse than that? You have no idea. Hi, folks. General George here. From the jungles of Vietnam to the jungles you call home, I've seen the same problem everywhere. Pests. Hate them all. Roaches. Ants. Fleas. Scorpions and snakes. So, the next time the minions of Satan declaring war at your door, don't raise the white flag. Attack! Call for General George, Pest Eliminator! I'll kick some bug... ass! General George, he's the man ♪ If he can't do it Nobody can ♪ Call 1-500-KICKASS for the Pest Eliminator in your battle field and tell them the General sent you. As you were. I still don't understand why we have to move. I love living in Newport. Oh, honey. You know losing his job, wasn't the best thing for your father's heart condition. Here we go. Look, we can all do with a lot less stress in our lives. We're going to be fine. Well, Dad couldn't you just get a job that was less stressful. I mean, I'm sure there are plenty of places that would hire you. Honey, getting fired--downsized was the best thing that ever happened to me. It opened my eyes to what's truly important. Buying the lodge is something I should've done a long time ago. I'll finally get to relax. We'll have a better quality of life. All of us. Want to go swimming? What, here? Now? Nah, I didn't even bring my trunks. Who said anything about trunks? Come on, silly. I'm glad you could join me. Your swimsuit' s a little long though, isn't it? I feel safer that way. I won't bite. At least not yet. Come on, you've heard the stories about this lake. Oh, please, you don't believe sheriff Carlson's old wives tales about people getting their legs gnawed off in the water, do you? What about the Johnson kid? I heard he partied too much with his dad and got caught in a propeller or something. And his daddy covered it up so he wouldn't have to go to jail. The sheriff seemed pretty convinced. Yeah? Well I am convinced that we would make the most People Magazine-looking couple in the entire county and the children we would have... it would be so hot. - Jesus. I've never had quite that reaction. There's something in the water. - Get out of here! Did you see anything? It never came up from under the water, but... whatever it was it was big, I'll tell you that much. You think it was the same thing that mangled the Johnson kid? I don't know. Veronica, let's get that leg of yours cleaned up. I don't want to risk any infection. Okay. Bo, first thing tomorrow morning we search the lake. Until then, it's off limits. Yes, sir. Well, this is it. This sure is a beautiful peaceful place, isn't it? Yeah, so is a cemetery. Doesn't mean we have to live there. Oh, come on Shannon! I know, I'm being a brat. It's just... my whole life was just pulled out from underneath me. I didn't even have a choice. And I didn't have a choice about losing my job, but I dealt with it and made the best of a bad situation just like you will. Now look, I know that we've come here for a reason and I just know that our moving here it's going to be a blessing for all of us. Don't you think that some things just happen for no reason at all? I don't mean to be difficult, Sheriff, but don't you think you're being a little bit hasty here? I mean, just because some girl got a scratch on her leg, you want to shut down the lake? You saw Jaws, didn't you? Sheriff waited too long before doing anything. That's a movie. Look, we haven't even moved in yet. I've got my life savings sunk in this place and you want to shut down the lake. We'll go broke. It's only for a few days until we find out what's going on out there. Then everything will be just fine. Nice meeting you folks. Alright doc. I've never seen anything quite like this. This laceration wasn't made by any animal I've come across. You said this happened in the lake? Yeah, last night. It was probably a fish or water moccasin or something. Yeah. Look, I'd cover it, but I think the wound needs to breathe. I've done all I can, but I'm going to send a culture to the lab for testing. But, just as a precaution. Oh, I hate needles. Won't take long, ready? Here we go. - There. All right, Veronica. I want to see you in a few days, just to make sure you're alright, okay? It'll be fine. Thanks, Laurie. Sure. All right, come on out with it. I know that look. Remember the Johns boy? How could I forget? This town did have a real MD until that happened. Scared old doctor right out of town. Yeah, I heard it was pretty gruesome. Damnedest sight I've ever seen. It was like something rotted his flesh to the bones and then devoured him alive as he watched. When we found him, his eyes were bugged out like... one of those old monster movies. You don't think there's any connection between that and Veronica, do you? I mean one's a flesh wound and the other... besides, that happened ten years ago and there hasn't been anything since, nothing. I'm sure you're right. But, call me when you get the test results. I will. Don't see anything, Sheriff. I don't know, let's keep going. Shit! Sheriff! Get a little closer, Bo! Get a little closer. Don't shoot me! That was one hell of a shot, Sheriff. I mean, I wasn't scared or anything, but... Then you are opening the lake up again? I don't see why not. Oh, honey. What happened? Did he catch the great white shark out there or something? Yeah, that's what he did. He caught that big white shark. I haven't seen you here before. Are you staying at the lodge? Actually, my parents just bought it. I'm Shannon. Steve Williams. - Hi. - I work at the station down the street. Well, at least until I get enough money to get out of this town. Yeah. Beware! The demons amongst us! Beware the demons. Oh, go spook someone else, will you. It's over here. There aren't no more demons, you drunk old loon. Armageddon is near. Death is near. Get out of here. The party's over. What was that all about? That was crazy old Jedediah. Guess every town's got a guy like that. Not Newport beach. Who is he? People say he used to be a minister. One day a bolt of lightning struck his church and the whole place burnt down. He says that the end is near. Anyway, that was all before I was born. I guess this town is just full of weirdoes and old stories, huh? No, just old Jedediah. And the lake. Freaky. I can't believe anybody would go into that water again. Well, it happened a long time ago. I must've been ten years old, and it hasn't happened since. Not until the other night. Have you lived here your whole life? Well, most of the part I can remember. I never really knew my folks. My mom was raped when she was a kid and died a few years later. And Buck, the guy who owns the gas station kind of took me into his home. I guess today, I'd probably be an abortion statistic. Don't even say that. Everything happens for a reason. Steve, there you are. Veronica, hi. What are you doing here? I was about to ask you the same thing. Who's your little friend? This is Shannon. Her parents just bought the lodge. Oh, how rustic. I'm Veronica. Steve's girlfriend. I-- I'd better get going. It was nice meeting you both. Nice to meet you. Veronica... why did you do that? - I mean, that was completely uncalled for. Like I have to tell you. I mean, two seconds later and she'd have her tongue practically down your throat. I saved you. You saved me? From what? Mono, herpes, maybe even aids. - I don't get you. I practically save your life and you're upset with me? What are you talking about? I mean, how to do you know she isn't like a total slut or something. You don't know her. You don't know anything about her. But me on the other hand, I'm like honey, and you're my Mr. Bumblebee. We're just so sweet together. I know you want me. Every man wants me. Well, Sheriff... both lucky you're still a pretty good shot. This could have been pretty bad. Exactly what kind of fish is this? Well, it's scientific name is ichthyosis. It's commonly known as a scar fish. The most tenacious fish there is outside of the shark family. The strange thing is they usually live in very cold, very deep water. This is the first I've ever heard of one coming to shore before. Let's see what we got in here. It was pregnant? Well, in a matter of speaking, yes. Looks like in a couple weeks this baby would've given birth to dozens more of these guys. Do you mind if I study these? Have yourself a seafood omelet. Listen Laurie... you don't think there could be more of these? I just don't want anyone to get hurt. I understand. Look... even if there are more of these, they live thousands of feet below the surface. This is the first I have ever heard of one attacking a human. I just think this was a very rare, very isolated incident. So you think the lake is safe? Well, from bacteria, germs and other forms of contamination, no. But from killer fish, I think we're in the clear. Thanks. Ok, let's see. What? Oh my gosh. How on earth did this get in there? Hello? Dr. Fujimoto. Hi, this is Laurie Casey. I was one of your graduate students. Oh yes, pretty blonde. Long legs. Nice chest cavity. I remember you very nicely. Tell me, Lacey what can I do for you? It's Laurie. Laurie... never mind. Listen, we had an incident involving a scar fish and I found a roach inside its digestive track. Well... how do you know it didn't get in afterwards? Well, that's possible, but I don't think so. Would you mind having a look at it? Very disgusting. Professor? Professor, you there? Sorry, Lacey I was seeing which insect would survive. The short powerful one I call Tyson. The tall fast one I call Holyfield. Tyson just bit Holyfield's antenna! I see. Don't worry, Cammie everything's going to be just fine. Hey, Norman. Hi Norman, this is my wife Cammie. Cammie, this is Norman, our manager. I'm so happy to meet you. Gill has told me so much about you. How's business? It's busy now through the end of August. Then it's packed again at the start of ski season. Great. - All 18 rooms full. I think you made a real quality investment here. Well, we're just looking for some peace and quiet. My husband tends to get a bit nervous. Honey... Stress. - Honey, I'm not stressed. Yes, he is. Well, if you need anything, I'll be right here at my post. Uh... I hope they sing better than they look. Black cat, full moon. All I need now is to walk under a ladder. Get out while you can. Save yourself. Armageddon is near. Death is near. - Hi, honey. - Hi. Hello, sweetheart. Well, what do you think? They're actually kind of colorful. I think they're very... real. Yeah, regular Hootie and the Blowfish. She sure is nice. Sweet, you know. It's like you can just just talk to her. A girl you wanna talk to, instead of doing the wild thing. She must look like dog shit. I'll be right back, okay man? Okay. Hi. Town song? Practically the anthem. I guess our music is a little behind here. - Not quite top 40. - No, I don't think so. Hey, I want to apologize for what happened at the diner. It's not your fault. Just because you're involved with someone who's a little possessive... I'm not involved with Veronica. She's not my girlfriend. She's a little... crazy. She said that you guys were-- She says a lot of things. I've known this girl my whole life. Everyone in this town has known her their whole lives. Well, we're not exactly in Kansas anymore. But, we're pretty damn close. You know what, this place grows on you after a while. There's some good things about it. Do you wanna dance? To this? Yeah. Yeah, sure why not. All right, come on I'll show you how to two-step. You know, I'm beginning to think that moving here was a good idea. I think I'm going to like it. I think you may not be the only one. Look over there. Good morning, Norman. You all right? Still a little shaky, Mr. Griffin. That incident last night sure scared a lot of people. It scared the hell out of me. Did they check everywhere for bugs? Checked and sprayed everywhere. Nothing. Good. Did my daughter come down yet? Haven't seen her. She's probably still sleeping. I'm sure she was up most of the night. The kid's just terrified of bugs. I'm more than happy to help, but don't you think this is something the county coroner's office should handle? I am a veterinarian-- And more qualified than any MD I've ever known. You know how it is when something goes to the county. It'll take months to hear back anything. Look, I don't know. Once you've taken a look, we'll send it there anyway. I just want to play it safe. Alright. Oh, god. What do you make of it? Larvae living in a human corpse? I know it sounds crazy, but I think the larvae somehow killed him. Do you remember that strange insect I sent you, the one I found inside a fish? Mhm. I just found another one alive inside the corpses mouth. Very peculiar specimen you sent me. Why is that? Although it closely resembles a member of the genus Blattella. Blattella? Yes, Blattella. Better known as the common cockroach. But this fellow's genetic sequence is unlike that of any insect on record. It's an entirely new species. What are you saying? I don't know yet. I don't know. I don't know why I keep having the same dream. The funny thing is, the room in the lodge I dreamt about it before we even thought of moving here. It's like déjà vu or something. That's pretty weird. Kind of freaky. What's freaky is that guy last night. I hate bugs. Who doesn't. I'm sure it's one of those things that happens once every thousand years or so. Hope so. I can't believe I actually have to live there. Yeah, did they check for more? Fumigated the whole lodge. I made them do my room twice. That's good. Do you have plans tonight? There's an old movie playing in town and I thought maybe... Anything to get out of my room. Good. General George here! Pest Eliminator! From the jungles of Vietnam to the jungles you call home General George kills them all. Roaches. Ants. Fleas. Scorpions and snakes. I hate rats too. So the next time you see Satan's minions attacking your door, don't raise the white flag. Attack! Call General George. Pest Eliminator! I'll kick some bug ass! General George he's the one - If he can't do it - Yeah... right. Call 1-500-kick-ass for the Pest Eliminator in your battlefield and tell them the General sent you. I also hate rats. Isn't there anything else playing? These movies scare the shit out of me. This is a classic. Anyway, it's just a movie. Effects aren't even that good. This is too scary. It's just a dream. Vincent Price is playing with the guys' head so he's got him right where he wants him. At least I'm not the only one having nightmares. There you are. I'm going to kill you. I can't watch this. This is great. See the whole thing with the dream is that he's finally facing his fears So now he knows who the true enemy is and he can confront the guy or go insane. I'll work on that. - Can I have some popcorn? - Yes. Last night the small, very small resort town of Mountain View California was rocked for the second time in as many days when two people watching a horror movie inside this movie theatre died sudden, inexplicable deaths that can only be described as gruesome and disgusting. Right out of a Freddy Krueger movie only way gnarlier commented one young movie goer that was in there. Apparently authorities are baffled as to the cause of these bizarre deaths and inside sources are saying the town may be quarantined until the causes of these deaths can be found. Ma'am! Katie Cunning, FU2 news. We understand that your grandson was actually one of the corpses identified inside. Well, that is what could be identified from the ghoulish, - bug infested rotted flesh that was once - your son-- - That's enough. Quick, zoom in on the old lady. In an FU2 exclusive in mere seconds, those of you at home may witness - for the first time-- - Get the camera off-- ...live on national television a living corpse as it rots and oozes right before your very eyes. I'm Katy Hennig from FU2 news. What the.. March 3, 11:57 am. The outer membranes of the shell seem to have experienced a growth of what appears to be 100% in just two days. The strange thing is these eggs don't seem to be exhibiting any of the characteristics normal for their species. There've been three deaths. Larvae infected each of their corpses along with a live roach-like insect being found in each of them. I just can't help but wonder if there's any connection between the roach I found in the fish and the ones I found in the humans. The answer may lie inside of the eggs. Hi, Buck. Miss Veronica. Would you like yourself a fill up? Actually, I need a man. Is Steve around? Hey Steve, get your butt on over here. Ms. Veronica wants to talk to you. What is it Veronica? I wanted to see you. I haven't been feeling very well lately. You've seen a doctor? I don't need to see a doctor, I need you. I keep thinking about you. C'mon Veronica, you're a beautiful girl. You could have any guy you want. Then why don't you want me? Is it that plain-looking girl from the lodge? Because I can look more ordinary. Schoolgirl-like, if that's what floats your boat. I can't do much about these, although I must confess no one's ever wanted me to. They seem to like them just fine. C'mon, you know that's not it. - It's just that-- - What? I mean, I'd do anything for you. I cook, I clean. I make love real good. What else is there? Veronica, don't do this. I just don't want to be alone. It's depressing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Processing data. Analyze DNA. What exactly are you my little friend? Searching database. One moment Dr. Fujimoto. No match found. - No match found. - If you're not anything exactly, maybe you're mostly something. Reproductive. Warm blooded. Nocturnal. Toxic. Blattella. - Impossible. - Blattella. - It's an insect. - Blattella. It can't be warm blooded. What are you gonna do? You want to close off the town like they did in the outbreak? I don't know what to do. Forty years of sheriff and hardly a problem and now this. You think the bugs could be intelligent? Maybe like aliens, trying to kill off the human race so they could take over the planet. You know like in one of those old movies. And they're starting their planetary take-over with Mount View? You have quite an imagination. Well, you have to living in this town. I mean imagination and booze, there ain't much else. The autopsy results should be back in a few days. I don't have to be a coroner to know the bugs caused these deaths. Question is... what do we do to stop them? What about spraying the town with bug spray, like from a Cessna. Hmm. You may just make sheriff yet. Hey Sheriff, you sure you want to use this stuff? I heard it did some terrible things with the rats they tested it on. And it killed the net flies? Averted a major crisis. Let's just hope it does the same for us. Good luck. We just don't have any options, okay? Buying this place cleared out our savings, so like it or not we're just going to have to wait this out. Oh Gill, couldn't we just go to my parents' house for a couple of weeks till this all is over. Yeah, I'm up for that. Then we can come back and you can sell this place when it's safe. Aren't we maybe overreacting just a little bit? I mean they're not even sure what caused all this. Dad... I saw it with my own eyes. I'm really scared. I can't sleep. I can't even turn my lights off. Oh, honey... are you having the nightmare again? The on where you're covered by giants bugs? Sweetheart, you've been having that same dream since you were a little girl. You're just afraid of bugs. It's a common phobia. Well, this place isn't helping the situation any. Mr. Griffin, there's a press conference the sheriff called - to talk about the problem. Good afternoon As I'm sure everyone in Mount View is by now painfully aware, there have been three deaths in recent days. While the cause has yet to be determined, there is reasons to believe the Larvae found at the scenes may somehow be linked. Therefore, I have ordered the spraying of the pesticide Phythyon. Due to the toxic nature of this chemical, I'm requesting that everyone honor a curfew of 9 o'clock this evening. To reduce the risk of human contact... You see, the Sheriff's got it all under control. Everything's gonna be just fine. I reckon that spraying killed off all of them little critters. I'm a hell of a lot bigger than they are and that shit sure affected me. Gave me one whale of a headache. Don't you worry, Buck. It's all gonna be over soon. I'll take it. Laurie sounded frantic. Hope she's okay. Oh, god what are you doing here? You scared the hell out of me. I'm sorry Laurie, but I guess we're all a little bit on edge. Yeah, from your call it sounded like trouble. Yeah, look at this. Damn, bugs ate the fish eggs. I don't think so. What are you saying? I'm saying, I think the bugs evolved from the fish eggs. I thought these were the fish eggs. The fish was the host. She was just carrying the eggs, sort of like a surrogate mother. Who's the lucky father of these slimy little children? I don't know. Well, let's get rid of them, before they cause more trouble. Bo? Don't look at me. You're the Sheriff, I mean, you got seniority in this, experience. Careful, Sheriff. Yeah, don't let them slime you. Lacey thinks Larvae hatch in water. Computer says your DNA is Larvae. So if Larvae is born in water and Blattella is Larvae, then Blattella should survive in water, right? There you go. I guess Mark Spitz is not a very good name for you. - Steve? - Yeah? There's a young lady on this phone whose voice is as sweet as sugar on honey. I wish to hell I was young again. Hello. Hi Steve, it's Shannon. Hey, are you okay? I was a little worried about you. I barely slept last night, but I'll be fine. I wanted to see you. Can you come by? Yeah, I get off about seven. Is that okay? Yeah. I miss you. I miss you too. Bye. What's with the pins? It represents every time there's been an attack. I'm trying to see if there's a pattern. Very professional. Hey, what do you think about old Jedediah? You know Shannon, the girl whose family bought the lodge? Her family filed a complaint and said he's been outside her room the last couple of nights. He do anything? Isn't being a peeper enough to haul him in? I mean the guy scares the bodily waste out of me. We just have to wait until he actually does something. Shit. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, Shannon. Shannon, you there? Hello? Steve. Did you just call? No, why is something wrong? No, no I'm sure it's nothing. I'm almost ready, are you on your way? Yeah I just gotta go home and change then run an errand so I'll be there as quick as I can. Oh... OK, just don't be too late, I'll be waiting in the lobby. OK. Business isn't exactly thriving. The lounge act died, what do you expect? Honey, that act died a long time before we ever got here. The... sheriff came by this afternoon. Yeah? Is he gonna do something about that psycho old guy? Yeah, he said he'd do what he could. He also presented an offer on behalf of someone. What sort of offer? A real estate offer. Someone is willing to buy the lodge. You're kidding! That's great! When can we leave? I can be packed in no time. Hold on, before you get too excited, you should know the offer isn't a very good one. In fact it's barely 25 cents on the dollar. But... in light of all that's happened here, I'm not sure we have much of a choice. Look, I can only stay a minute, alright? You just got here. I mean... Have a little drink with me. What is it, Veronica? What is so important you had to see me right away? Here. Jesus Christ, what happened to you? I don't have the foggiest idea what you're talking about. Don't you just love this song. It's my absolute favorite. Veronica, your skin, it's all... It's all festered. I don't know what's wrong with me. My skins it's all funny. I think maybe I need to see a cosmetologist. What? You know... a beautician. I think there's one in San Bernardino. Oh Jesus, what is this? You don't like it? It's moonshine. My great grandfather's recipe. They say it'll cure anything. Even better than chicken soup. Look, Veronica, we've gotta get you to a doctor. I mean a real doctor. No. It'll be OK. I mean it's probably just a... Just a 24 hours bug or something. What is it? What? What is it? Is it your leg? I got bit. I think it's maybe a little bit... infected. Let me take a look-- - No! My legs don't look very pretty. It's OK, I'm just gonna take a look, OK? Oh my God. Oh Jesus! I'm scared! - Oh God. - I don't have anybody left here. I didn't know who else to call. Veronica, we've gotta get you to a hospital, OK? No, I don't wanna go to a hospital. People die there. I just want you to hold me, please just take care of me. OK, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine, come on. Everything's gonna be OK, just like that. You really think so? Yeah. Really? - Yeah you know, doctors can... can do anything these days. Yeah I mean I guess if they can put a man on the moon they can fix a few silly little bumps on my leg, right? Oh Jesus! Veronica, I'm gonna call an ambulance, OK? Just hang in there. Help me, please! Jesus. It hurts! What's happening to me? You're gonna be fine. Come on! Please help me! Help me! Steve! Please! Ow! I don't believe this, he's over an hour late. He's standing me up. Oh honey, I really don't think he's doing that. He seemed like such a nice young man. Yeah they all seem nice at first till you get to know them. I'm going to bed. Daddy, I'm really glad you decided to sell this place. I can't wait to get home. Good night. - Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Good night, darling, sleep well. I worry about her. I do too. But you know what, I'm proud of you for selling this place. I know it's not gonna be easy, the money and everything. But, honey, we're gonna be fine. You're a good husband. And a good father. And I love you. You know... I think our daughter had the right idea going to her room. What do you say we go to ours? Oh yeah? What do you have in mind? - Something nasty. We'll be right back after this message from our sponsor. - General George here. Do the soldiers of Satan have you by the short hairs? I'm talking bugs, my friend. And I don't mean bunny. Are bugs infesting your life? Making it a living hell for you and your loved ones? - Well it's time to fight back! It's time to bring out the redeemer! Oops. So when you wanna rid your life of irksome insects, call on the one, who does it best. Call for General George. Pest eliminator! - And I'll kick some bug... ass. ♪ General George he's the one Eradicating the insect scum ♪ Call 1-500-KICKASS for the pest eliminator in your battlefield and tell him the general sent you. As you were. ♪ All day long ♪ ♪ I keep neglecting ♪ ♪ Things I have to do ♪ ♪ That people Are expecting... ♪ Well... What do you think of this, Mr. Griffin? I don't wanna have to think. Did you remember to take your heart medication? With the way you look tonight I better have the whole bottle. Ho-ho-ho. Look at you feeling frisky. I feel like a whole new man. I like the way this man feels. Oh my God, mom! Oh yes. Oh, Gil! Oh! You're the king! Gil! Don't stop! You're the best! It got worse. What in the hell happened to her? They... they just started hatching out of her. I called the medic over an hour ago but he's still not here. There's nothing more you could've done. You did all you could. Could someone cover the body? She wouldn't want anyone to see her like that. Bo? I ain't going near that thing. No damn way. Shannon! Shannon! Shannon, are you in there? What is it? I'm coming in! Shannon! Get them off me! Don't move. Get them off me! I got it. I got it, OK. I got it. - No problem. OK. Oh my God! I'm sorry about Veronica. I know we weren't exactly friends. But nobody deserves to die like that. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. So what time are you guys getting out of here? If I had my way as soon as my parents wake up. What time do they usually get up? Early. Last night was a special night for them. They didn't get to bed till kind of late. I'd better wake them up. They'd be mad if they blew the whole day. Can you ring my parent's room please? Sure. Oh my god. No! Oh God! Come on, Shannon, we've gotta get out of here. No! Come on! No! Come on, baby. Gil and Cammie Griffin who recently purchased this lodge were the latest victims in these bizarre deaths as they're naked bodies were just rolled away moments ago and I for one can tell you it was not a pretty sight. Also last night the rotted, bug infested corpse of Veronica Heart was found inside her home. Now sources say that the busty town babe's death was different than the others in that Veronica Heart was incubating roaches and larvae inside what was once her body. Excuse me sir, Katie Cunning, "Fu2 News". Now, first the lounge act, then your boss and his wife both naked. Very gross, very dead. This cannot be good for business. I'm not sticking around to find out. Well there you have it. We have five dead humans. One dead bimbo, bugs are everywhere. Rumors are rampant-- excuse me, Sir? Katie Cunning "Fu2 News". Now everybody is talking about that Mount View is just one giant bug infested nest with alien insects incubating inside humans to launch an attack on mankind. Can you comment on this? Armageddon is near. Death is near! Aren't we a ray of sunshine? Well word is that world renowned pest eliminator General George has been called in to help eliminate the problem. Until then all roads in and out of Mount View will be closed off. Well, as you can see it's sunny and breezy now but the town's population, what's left of it wait in terror - for night to fall. The unspeakable question on everyone's mind is - who will be next--excuse me! Come on! I'm Katie Cunning, "Fu2 News". Due to technical difficulties beyond our control - we now return to... - night. The attacks all happened a night. Or near moisture, that's it! Yeah. Mhm. What's she saying? Just a minute. Until we find the source everyone in this town should know one thing. Don't even think about turning out the lights. Well? It's just like Laurie said, they're pretty much everywhere, dark or with water. The lake, the lodge, the theater, homes. I'll tell you this I'm sure glad I don't own any real estate in this town. At least not if I had to sell it. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand. Practically an epidemic. Well I did something about it. I called General George. He said he'd welcome the challenge. He's on his way as we speak. You called who? You know, General George, the bug guy on television. General George? You may as well have called one of those TV ministers to exorcise the town from the bugs. Wanna get out of here. Just gotta get out of here. Thanks for coming with me. It's not like I have any reason to stay. What the hell? What's going on, Luke? What, are you a deputy now? The sheriff, he deputized all of us. Town's under quarantine till further notice. That's why we even have the Highway Patrol. Sheriff's orders. So what are you saying, we can't leave here? If you leave, the bugs may leave with you and we can't have that so... you're gonna have to turn around. When can we get out? General George's coming in. It should be no time at all. TV bug guy? Due anytime now. Well I'll be... And they said pesticides wouldn't cause side effects. Looks like they were wrong. The question now is... what are you? What in the Sam Hill is going on with you two? I thought you were leaving town. We were but they shut off the whole highway. Nobody in or out. Well it looks like somebody got in. General George. He's real? I thought he's just an actor from one of those commercials like Colonel Sanders. That man is a living legend. He was a war hero in Vietnam. What did he do? He survived. General George. General George! General George? I hope you don't mind me interrupting you like this, Sir. But... I just wanna say what a great honor is to finally meet you. Fill it up. It'll be my pleasure. I'm a military man myself. Served in WWII in the Motor Pool. Served under the command on General Dwight D. Eisenhower himself. My one regret in life was that I never really did have the chance to meet that man-- Oh! I'm sure you would've made quite an impression. Listen, Sir. You're just gonna have to forgive me but... I gotta go and use the facilities. It's all right Buck, I'll fill it up. Hop to it. I understand your town has a little... problem. Things have gotten pretty bad around here, so I hope you're as good as you say you are. Shannon's parents, they... Casualties of war? Come here, dear. Come here. It's always a tragedy when innocent civilians lose their lives fighting a battle that wasn't theirs to fight. I'm sorry. Thanks. I just hope you get the rest of the bugs before anyone else... dies. I leave nothing to chance. I want a full comprehensive all-inclusive briefing. Facts. Everything you know, I wanna know. Understood? You do know the war's over? The war's never over son. Not as long as fine, God fearing people like yourselves are subject to the dark shadow of tyranny. What's your plan? First and foremost you have to know and understand the enemy. Learn their strengths. Exploit their weaknesses. I've still got the good stuff. So tell me. Have you seen the face of the enemy? I never want to see another bug as long as I live. Don't you worry. When General George opens up his can of whoop ass... there will be roaches in Siberia feeling the heat. Uncle Buck! Buck! Stand back son. You two sure you wanna do this? This is personal. For both of us. Then lets kick some bug ass. So this is where it all started? A postcard of serenity to the untrained eye. What do you mean? Do you see something? Bug tracks. Lots of them. Yeah. They appear to be amphibious. That means they can live in water and on dry land. And... as we learnt at the good soldiers grave. They have a particular aversion to... daylight. What are they, killer roaches? Mutants. Mutants? Yes. What started out as an ordinary insect is now a toxic killer that thrives once inside the bloodstream of human beings. So you're saying that once they get inside the body they spontaneously lay larvae which destroy human tissue as they multiply at hyper-accelerated rates? That's exactly what I'm saying. The larvae metamorphoses into mature insects which then continue to lay more larvae eggs until they enter their cocoon. The Blattella undergo metamorphosis? What do they become? It's amazing, Lacey. It's unlike anything I've ever seen. Can you see it? Yes. Yes! What is it? - It's a-- Professor? Professor! Professor! Professor! What is it? Talk to me! Oh my God! Professor! Professor! You say this is where the dead girl was fish bait? Yeah except it was at night. Uh-huh! That's always when they attack in the dark. They have the advantage of not being seen. - Yes Question. How do they spend their days? And where? Somewhere dark? Where it's damp or wet. Very good! You guys are very good! I'm very impressed. Hungry? Question. What's dark and damp? With bugs all over? Bo? Bo? What happened, are you OK? Dr. Fujimoto's dead. Dr. Fuji-who? A scientist in Palo Alto. I sent him a roach and the roach turned itself into something and killed him. Look, we have to take action now because the bugs are going to do the same thing to us. There's nothing more we can do. Bo, listen to me, you don't understand. The people we have lost so far that's nothing compared to what will happen if we don't do something. We are all in grave danger. Don't you think I know that? The sheriff told me to stay put. Someone's got to be at the station. What is that? I was just trying to figure out if there was some sort of pattern on the attacks. The lake. They all started at the lake. You think they're spawning under water or something? Underwater or underground. Where it's dark and damp. The old Esther mine. When was the last time somebody was up there? It's been a long time. Place has been shut down for years. Ever since old man Jonathan got drunk and killed his kid in a boating accident. Boating accident? Yeah. Jonathan's son got all mangled in the lake. Everyone thought it was from the boats propeller but... Jonathan's been a drunk ever since he found out there's no gold in the mine. That ain't the gold we're looking for. What do we do now? - Hang on. - Hey! What is it? I'm not sure. Is it... bugs? What the hell is it? Vampire bat. Vampire bat? Its bite's deadlier than the king cobra. Kill you like that. Holy shit. Come on. I sure hope we're doing the right thing coming here. - Well if I'm right... Try it again. Damn thing won't start! Great, now what do we do? How do we get up the hill? Well... Wait a minute. What? You ever rode a horse before, Laurie? Oh no. Do you see something? I sense something. What? What is it? Movement. The walls. It ain't the walls, sweetheart. Oh my God! I think we hit the mother load. It's time to put these bugs... On ice! Damn I'm good! You sense something? I see something. Oh it's you. For a minute there I thought you were the enemy. Sheriff? You know, for an old abandoned mine this place sure is crowded. General George! I love your commercials, I'm a big fan. Are you? Oh well, thanks. Which one you like the best? You know the one with the rope, where you're swinging? The Tarzan thing. They wanted me to wear a harness for the thing. Then they wanted me to wear a little skirt there like a-- Will everyone cut the crap! Why don't we all get out of here. - Good idea. Let's go. Wait! Do you see something? Do you sense something? I hear something. Well I'll be a larvae's uncle! Oh Jesus. The eggs. Stand back everyone! These bugs are gonna feel the heat of hell. I'd put that down if I were you, general. I said drop your weapon, general. What is this? Now, everyone into the shaft! Now! Son of a bitch. You knew the whole time about this place. The Blattella, everything! You knew! Why, sheriff? Why in the world are you doing this? Why do you think? You think I'm going to be broke my whole life? Sheriff in some hip town pushing 70? And can't even afford new dentures? Not this, yoko. This whole damn town is standing on a billion dollars' worth of gold. It's going to be mine! All mine! The Jonathan's kid. The mother bug got him. Only the old Doc has figured it out. Stupid old bastard wanted to kill the mother that laid the golden egg. I knew it was only a matter of time before she struck again and people would want to get out of town. Sell their property... cheap. You made the offer on the lodge. And if they'd taken it sooner your parents might still be alive. You're a twisted old bastard. You have no idea. Um... sheriff? What is it, General George? Mommy's home. You don't actually expect me to believe that nonsense? Do you? It's nightfall. She's in the lake! Oh yeah. I forgot. Now, into the damn shaft! Or I'll shoot every damned one of you starting with the girl. Do as I say! Now! If you're gonna shoot someone, shoot me. What? If that's the way you want it. No, no! Get her out of here! Go! It's just you and me. Let's get ready to bumble. You messed with the wrong exterminator, sweet cheeks! Your head's gonna look real nice on my wall. Missy. All right, cold war's over, baby. Let's see what you look like as a firefly! - Oops. No! I hope General George is gonna be all right. No! - What are we gonna do? - Let's wait till he comes out. What if another bug comes out instead? Steve! Let's see how you like a little hot lead! It's just you and me. Mano y mano. Come on! Come on! You want a piece of me? You wanna piece of me? You're really... pissing me off! I'll see you in hell! Wait here, ladies. I got me a bug to rope! Yee-haw! Come here, buggy! Oh shit! Come on, horse, get me out of this! Watch out! Give it to him! God, General George! Where is she? Hurry! Where is she? She's right there. Careful. Hurry, please. Oh God! I'm good, I swear! Die you hairy bitch. I kicked that bugs... A... Ass? Yeah. In the news today, General George S. Merlin remains in satisfactory condition after a life and death struggle with the mother bug... Oh, it's nothing really. I was looking for you both everywhere. Stopped at the police station and everything. Hi! I'm sheriff now, got me a little more responsibility. There was a little disturbance in the lake, that's all. I was just checking some water samples. I'm sure it's nothing. Well I just wanted to say good-bye and thank you both for everything. You sure you don't wanna stay with us? Well, after everything that happened, I'm sure. OK. All right. Well... Bye, bye. Take care - OK. - Bye, see you later. Bye. Armageddon is near! Death is near. You're all gonna die! Bye! See you later.
