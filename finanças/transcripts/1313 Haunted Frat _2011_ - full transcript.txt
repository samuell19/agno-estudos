Gordon ...! Yeah, what, Smiley? Where the hell is everybody? Spring Break, man. There's still a few of the guys around because of the game. Everybody else is gone til next week. Yeah, well, that's great, except I got stuck writing this tenth anniversary essay for the fraternity. So? "So?" You told me we'd all pitch in on this. Why do I have to do it by myself? I thought you were the brains of this outfit? Apparently not. You know this counts as part of our review, right? If I don't get it done on time, they cut our funding. Talk to Andrew. When did we all start taking orders from Andrew? Since always. He's the head of the fraternity, man. Well, I didn't vote for him ... Guess what? I'm going swimming. Gordon ... I hate Spring Break ... (Knocking) Hello ...? Smiley, if that's you, I'm still not helping you with that essay! Cowboy up, dude! Gordon ... Hello ...? Why won't you play with me, Gordon? Okay, what's up with the Peeping Tom routine? Well, whoever you are, I hope you like what you see.. (SCREAMS) Huhhh.. Huhhh.. That was so not funny, Kels! Not from where I'm standing ...! What are you looking for? A puddle! Are we done now? Come on man. I'm sorry I gotta amuse myself somehow ... Glad you have some free time on your hands. What's wrong, little buddy? Knock it off, huh? I'm serious. I got stuck writing the essay for the frat committee. Ohh, that ten-year anniversary thing? How did you get that gig? Because everyone else either went home or decided to hide out from me. So Anyways, if you're just sitting around bored, maybe you could ... Uh-uh, man, I would but uh, I got a month's worth of laundry to take care of before a stroke of lightning strikes and brings it to life or something. How about some one else? I know Andrew's still here, so are Brad, Liam, Cliff, Dude get Gordon ... Well, I already tried Gordon, but he blew me off to go swimming. No he didn't. I was just at the pool. and theres No one is there. Well, somebody's gonna help me. Well how hard could it be to write about this place? Some rich guy builds a mansion, decides to donate it to the fraternity a month later. The end. Add some paragraphs about rich people boom your done. It's not that simple. Sounds pretty simple. You know about the place that was here before the mansion was built? A national park? Try an insane asylum. What? Yeah. Some kind of sanitorium. I couldn't believe it, either, but I just read it in my copies of the public records ... So, what happened to the sanitorium? Well, I didn't get exactly to that part, because you decided to mess with me. Wait, Just now, you were reading? 'Cause that didn't look like "reading" to me. No, I meant, up in my room ... Look, anyways, What's important someone else besides me is gonna work on this. Or else I'm gonna go swimming and let you guys worry about the frat losing it's sponsorship. Ok Fine, if I run into anybody else on my way to the laundry room, I'll send them your way. That's the best I can do. Gee, I don't want to put you out or anything ... Hey, Don't mention it! Man! You don't get enough of this at practice? No way, man. They postponed the game, I'm taking advantage of the extra down time. I'd rather have gone on Spring Break. A bunch of us were gonna go down to Costa Rica . No offense, Brad, but the last time you guys went down there, two of you came back in handcuffs. And no regrets. I'll tell you what. We win this game, I'll pay for everybody to go to Costa Rica. Then, I suggest somebody get out their checkbook. You sure talk a good game. Somebody needs to take you down a peg. Anytime you feel froggy ... You give? Yeah, ease up! The last thing I need before the game is a dislocated shoulder! I could have had you. Yeah. Yeah "Could have". Well, while I can still move, I'm gonna hit the weights. Nice practicing with ya. Crap! What are you doing in here? Don't tell me you've been in here the whole time! You okay, man? Join us, Kelso. Let us show you how dark it is down here ... What are you talking about? Join us ... What the hell is wrong with you?!? Don't fight it, Kelso ... Oh !! Please tell me this is a joke ... Entre'. Sorry to disturb you, my liege. Oooo, nice! What the hell do you want, Smiley? Some help, for openers. So ... what's that? What's this?!? It's the essay that everybody else blew off! What the hell do you want me to do about it? Well, as head of the fraternity, I figured you'd kind of be interested in, you know, not losing it ... Again, what do you want me to do about it? Some help would be nice. A bunch of the guys are hanging around for that game. Why don't you ask one of them? I tried that. Gordon's busy, Kelso's busy, Brad and Liam are supposedly off practicing somewhere, I don't even know where Cliff or Davis are ... Don't look at me. I don't "do" essays. What makes you think I do? Aren't you the brains of this outfit? Why does everybody keep saying that? What do you need me for? You can bang this out in like an hour. See, that's what I thought. Turns, out, this place has a really wild history. Remember the old sanitorium outside of of town? Yeah, the freaky old hospital they had to close down back in the Eighties? It burnt down. Anyway, guess what they built in its place? Here? Are you serious? I haven't gotten to the good part, yet. You know when the hospital burnt down? Twenty-five years ago today. This place ain't twenty-five years old. Yeah. It was just an empty lot for fifteen years. Nobody wanted anything to do with it. Then, some rich dude builds This place. A mansion here and abandons it a month later, no explanation, no nothing. He sells it off for a quarter of the market value, which is how the Beta Beta Sigma got it. I heard one of the patients was locked in a closet and got burnt up in the fire. Maybe it was just bad karma? There's nothing in the public records. Okay, so there used to be a loony bin here. So what? So what's the big deal? What am I supposed to do, write an essay about the mental hospital that used to be here? The committee wants a fluff piece, not an expose' ... I'm sure you'll figure out something. You're a bright guy. I'm coming back here after your little game. Look, man, you get this done for us.. I'll owe you big. You name it. I'll give you a free backrub. What?!? Cliff buddy, I need you. I got a big essay to write! I'm sleeping! It's half-past noon! I had a rough night last night! I'm not writing this essay by myself, you hear me? I need your help! I thought you were the brains of this outfit? I'm gonna strangle the next person who says that! I need some "me time". As soon as I get up, I swear I'll pitch in! I'm gonna strangle the next person who says that, too. Huh! Some people ...! Join us, Liam. Join your friends. Come see how dark it is ... Who was that? Betty? Lisa? I swear to God, you sorority babes are nuts ...! Pre-game jitters. You're just hearing some chick's voice in your head. Maintain, buddy ...Maintain.. What's with the negativity? Did you see Cliff? I just got up. I was on my way to the shower. So ... no? Did you see Gordon? Brad? Liam? Kelso? I haven't seen anybody. They're hiding from me! I know it! You mind telling me what's going on? First, I get stuck writing this frat essay. Now, I find out this place was built over some burnt- out old insane asylum. What?!? Yeah, have you ever hear of the sanitorium that used to stand around here? That place is an old wives' tale. No, that place really existed. Here. It burnt to the ground twenty-five years ago today. Then, some rich dude builds this place on the same lot. He moves out a month later. Ten years ago today. Nah, man, it's a horror story. It was haunted or something. C'mon, Davis, haunted? Yeah, I think they said some patient was accidentally left in a padded room when the fire broke out. Whatever it is, there's no way I can gloss over the facts here and make it sound good. And it has to sound good. I thought you were the brains of this... Don't. You want help, I'll help. We'll figure out a to spin the whole loony bin angle. I'm a Journalism major, so it's no big deal. Finally! But first I have to hop in the shower first. No. People have been doing this to me all day. You'll go off, take a shower, then, you'll disappear into the magical world of the cafeteria or the gym or wherever the hell everybody else went ... It'll take me five minutes. No. You can wait outside the damn door. Okay. Take your shower. You're really gonna wait outside the door? You have no idea how bad I've been dogged today. You want a magazine or something? I'm timing you. What hell's going on in there, Davis ...? Still having a nervous breakdown about that essay? Something is very, very wrong ... What? The guys ... something happened ... something bad ... they're not normal ... Define "not normal" ... Uh ... blank stares, the sudden need to kill ... Yeah, very funny. I'm serious. Here's what happens. I'm going out that door. I'm going to go out into the hallway. And as soon as I see any of my frat brothers looking like rejects from "Night Of The Living Dead" -- and I won't -- I'm coming back in here, I'm kicking your butt and then, I'm gonna fix it so you don't have to stress out about that essay one more minute. Know why? Because im going to have you kicked out of this fraternity faster than can say "campus housing". Listen. Today is the twenty-fifth anniversary of that sanitorium burning down. Let's say, for the sake of argument, they forget to evacuate one of the patients. Some girl, some Jane Doe, she's locked in a padded room, she's burned alive. So, each year on this date, she comes back and haunts the grounds. Only now, it's a frat house. And this is the first time anybody reported it because ...? The dude who built this place moved out. Ten years ago today. Who knows what he saw? Then, it's a frat house. And this is the first year anyone's been here during Spring Break, because of that game getting postponed ... I don't believe you. Until five minutes ago, I didn't believe it. But you didn't see those guys. Something bad happened to them, and I think it has something to do with that patient ... Like I said, when I come back, you're out. Andrew? Andrew? Andrew?
