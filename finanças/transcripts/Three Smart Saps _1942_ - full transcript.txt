[WOMEN SOBBING] Stella. Nella. Bella. What's the matter? We have to call the wedding off. Father's in jail. We know he's in jail. He's been the warden for years. But he's not the warden anymore. Walker's clique framed him. And now Walker's the warden and father's a convict. How do you like that? [ALL SOBBING] Aw, don't cry, honey. I can't stand that. Dry your tears, dear. That's it. And you-- You make me feel so sad. Stop that, now. There you are. Wait a minute. I got it. He's got it. Listen, you got nothing to worry about. We'll get into the jail and get your father out. But there's something fishy going on. They won't arrest ordinary people. We're not ordinary people. We're morons. Speak for yourself. We gotta get into that jail. Come on. Nyuck nyuck. Hm. [CHUCKLES] Ow! No! [CRIES OUT] Woo-hoo. Look, we're practically in the clink now. Come on. Who did that? ALL: We did. Arrest us. Oh. Close your eyes. ALL: Oh! Our jail is for important people. Some nerve. He wouldn't arrest us. I got the idea. We get some rocks, we throw 'em through a window, we're sure to get pinched. Swell. Why didn't I think of that? What a dumbbell. What are you doin'? I'm mad at myself. So am I. [CRIES OUT] Listen, you. What? I think I know where I can find some rocks. Mr. Lansky, there she is. All done and absolutely unbreakable. [CLANGS] See that? You can't break it. [CLANGS] Now, come on, we'll get the other panel in, and you can help me. It's out in the back. All right. Company, halt. Right, face. Ready, aim, Wait a minute. I said right face. This is my right face. Well, I don't like it. That way. Ready, aim, fire. Hey, look. The window didn't break. Somethin' broke. I thought I heard a hollow sound. Hey, Moe, want to-- Hey, Moe. Say somethin'. Talk to me. Anything. I hate you. That's the sweetest words you ever said. And you won't slap me? Who said I wouldn't? Oh. Oh. Get up there. We gotta get into jail, and that window's gotta be broken. Well, what can we do? I don't know. Use your head. I-- Hm-hm. [CRASHING] [IMITATING JIMMY DURANTE] I got a million of 'em. Am I mortified. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh-- Bars on a jail. How do they expect anyone to get in? Quiet! Now, look, 5736, if you're gonna be out late, you better take the key. I want to go to sleep myself. All right. So long. Have a good time. Hi, guys. How could he see us? Must have been the garlic you ate last night. [KNOCKS "SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT"] MAN: Hello, Mr. No One. Come in. That's for us.

I quit. Good work, kid, good work. That's using your head. Look. A marble machine in jail. That's where they belong. That's for me. [WHINES] [BOINGS] [BELL RINGS, CUCKOO CHIRPS] [MAKING STRANGE NOISES] Wait a minute. We gotta find our fiancées' father. Maybe he's in solitary refinement. Wherever he is, we gotta find him. Boys. It's him. Our future father-in-law. Hello, Mr. Stevens. The girls told us about the trouble you were in, and we got in here to help you escape. No, there's only one way for me to get outta here, and that's to expose that crooked Walker. And then I can get my warden's job back. How can you expose them? They've been usin' this place as a hide-out for racketeers and gangsters. Right now they're holding a big party in the main room. Here, get some candid pictures for evidence, and I'll soon be free. And it's wedding bells for us? That's right. Leave it to me. I'm an expert. [CLICKS] Exhibit A. Exhibit B. Come on. [CROWD SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [CLICKS] Boy, this is really somethin'. Come on. Sorry, gentlemen. I can't admit you unless you have formal attire. Oh, snooty, eh? Yeah, you gotta have a snoot suit. That guy's suit will fit me. What are we waitin' for? Hey, Billiken.

Well, yes, I'm asking. Then I'm dancing. Fun's fun, but this is ridiculous. Oh! Moe's the name. Would you like to trip over the light fantasia? [CHUCKLES] Mm. Spirits. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Would you care to dance? Do you rumba? Only when I take bicarbonate. Nyuck, nyuck. But let's dance anyway. [HISSES] [SNORTS] [BARKS] [CRIES OUT] [CLICKS] [ALL LAUGHING] Do you feel a draft? Draft? No, I was exempted. Somebody lost their skirt. [BOTH LAUGH] [LAUGHS] Oh. I could dance like this forever.
