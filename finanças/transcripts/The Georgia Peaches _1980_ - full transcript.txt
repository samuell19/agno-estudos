(birds singing) (soft harmonica music) (exhilarating music) - This here's a waste of time. Ain't nobody dumb enough to run shine in broad daylight. Hot damn, it's him! (sirens wailing) (engine revving) (tires squealing) (officer bellowing) (startled yelling) - [Dusty] Uh oh! (sirens wailing) So long, sweet moonshine. (explosive booming) (rapid instrumental music) (engine cranking) (machinery zapping) (low radio music) (distant sirens approaching) - [Sue Lynn] What now? (low police radio chattering) - Hey, Sue Lynn, I'm lookin' for a silver coup with a madman behind the wheel. - There's nothing like that on my property, Orville. - Well, it looked an awful like your friend, Dusty, and you tell him for me that I'm gonna nail him good next time I see him. - I sure will. - [Orville] You do that now. - Bye! (low radio music) - Afternoon, Miss Peach. - Well, Dusty Tyree, you've interrupted your perpetual motion to see me? - [Dusty] Mm hmm. - I'd have fixed you a sweet potato pie if I'd known you was comin'. - Sue Lynn, honey, you know you're much better under the hood than in the kitchen. Now how's that new fuel injector coming? - Fine, but you ain't gonna be driver of the year in the penitentiary. - Hey, gotta catch me first. Listen, you mind if I do some work on that silver coup? I got me a new gadget I wanna try out for tonight's run. - Don't you think you should lay off? - Not after dumping 100 gallons of first-class shine. Someone tipped 'em off. They're layin' for me. Had a roadblock and everything. - Oh, and that's good as winnin' first place, huh? Havin' a roadblock in your honor. ♪ Been told guys'll make you smile ♪ - [Sue Lynn] Listen to that. ♪ Like the Mona Lisa ♪ So put a little mystery in your life ♪ - That is my sister. Did you hear that? - Lorette? - Yeah! - Last time I saw Lorette, she had so many braces her smile looked like the front end of a '53 Studebaker. Or was it '55? - Dusty, you wanna see what two years in Nashville have done for her? SHe's in town, singing at the Aces High. - Oo, sounds like she's going places, but I gotta make that run. - Well, you just remember what I said and take care. - Cross my heart. - Bye. (gentle instrumental music) - You know what to say, Delbert? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I mean, yes, ma'am. - [Vivian] That's better. - Want me to slap her around a little bit first to get her in the mood? - This is neither the time nor the place, Delbert. - You're the boss lady, Miss Stark. - You just be smooth and polite like you sell encyclopedias. But remember, Delbert, this deal's only going one way. - Yes, ma'am. (low plodding music) Afternoon, Miss Sue Lynn. - [Sue Lynn] Well, well, Delbert Huggins. You on sabbatical from the chain gang? - Sabbath radical? Hey, I ain't no sabbath radical. I go to church, real regular. - Oh, like to keep your hand in the collection plate? - You got a lot of sass for such a little ol' gal. It's a lucky thing for you that I don't take offense real easy. - What's on your mind, Delbert? - Well, Miss Vivian Stark, she's got a business proposition she thinks you might take a real liking to. - You know, when I hear the word proposition, you know what I think of? Traveling salesman with his hand on my knee. - (chuckling) Well, you might take an even bigger liking to this. Well, it is that Miss Vivian Stark, she's thinking about opening up a automobile distribution business, and this here location is ideal for that kind of operation. Now, she'll pay you good, cold, hard cash for your poor, dead daddy's land and this property. And you can stay on with your repair business. And on top of that, we might even be able to throw you a little extra work in body work, paint jobs, switch a engine or two. - You're talking about stolen cars? - I am a-talkin' about big bucks, gal. (startled squawking) - For doctoring hot cars. - That ain't no concern of yours. Damn, Sue Lynn. This here's my new seersucker suit. - Well, now it's your new grease-sucker suit, Delbert. (alarmed yelping) - Now hold on just a minute. You ain't heard me out, yet. - I heard plenty! Now get outta here! - [Delbert] Hold your fire, crazy woman! - Delbert say something to annoy you, honey? - I want you off myo property. - Why Sue Lynn, this isn't like you at all. Didn't he offer you enough money? - I'm just afraid if I took any of your money, I'd contract some sort of social disease. - You cheap little grease monkey, I can buy and sell you 10 times over. - What I got, you already sold, and all the crooked money on Earth can't buy it back, neither! - [Vivian] You little nerd! (rapid country music) - That's him, that's him, Miss Stark, that's Tyree! Goldarn, I guess our setup didn't work. - Well, he'll try again, but let's not bother the authorities this time. I would like you to take care of it yourself, Delbert. - Oh. Yes ma'am, yes ma'am. - Let's get this car cleaned up. - Yeah. (tense instrumental trill) (uptempo country music) - Why are you wearin' your costume, now? - Costume? This is my street clothes. You should see what I wear on stage, girl. - Woo, let's get down and show the people what they wanna see. - Boy, you got it. You know, one time, my agent sends me down to do this big-time convention deal. Took all my clothes, hauled 'em all the way down to Mobile. Got down there, and it was one them dadgum nudist colonies. I couldn't believe it. Everybody was running around naked as a jaybird. Gosh, the emcee, the orchestra, the audience. Boy, it was funny. They told me I couldn't sing with my clothes on. - So what'd you wear? - My goosebumps, honey. - Did you blush? - Oh, God, clear to my toes. - God. - But there was nothing else I could do. I didn't have bus fare to Nashville. - Ain't no business like show business, honey. I swear. - [Lorette] But I did get a good tan. (low harmonica music) (light country music) (phone ringing) - Afternoon, Georgia Peaches Automotive. Uh huh. Swingley Road? - Oo, a high-octane heaven. Boy, it brings back good old memories. - This is your old playpen, girl. - Breaker, breaker. Can you read me, Peach Pit? - Loud and clear, Dusty. - Call just come in to pick up a red '78 four-door, Virginia plates out on Swingley Road. - 10-4, I think I saw that on my way over. - Threw a rod or something. Owner said she'd call back in the morning. - Thank you. See ya shortly. - 10-10, 'til we do it again. - Is that the same Dusty you had a crush on in high school? - 'Fraid so. - You blushin' like you was in the nudist convention, too. (laughing) (muted police radio chattering) - [Officer] You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you-- - I just can't believe it. I just can't believe it. Here I come all the way down from North Carolina, trailing this old boy, hoping he'll lead me to his buyers, and you airheads bust him with a roadblock. - Well, howdy Officer Orville. No moonshine this trip. - Howdy, Sue Lynn. And howdy to you, Lorette. - Hi. - We're not after shine today. - You're not? - No, ma'am. They had a big holdup at the government printing office in Atlanta this morning. Over five million in brand new bills. - Oo, doggies. - That's a big game than whiskey runners. Is that your boy over there? - No, that's just some smuggler. - No loot, huh? - Not yet. - Well, happy hunting, anyway. - [Orville] Okay, Sue Lynn. - 55 gallons, Leslie, guaranteed to clear your blues and blur your vision. - Long as she clears 400% profit, it's all right with me. - The gospel, according to Leslie. Sorry about bein' late, catch you next week. (engine revving) (rhythmic drumming music) - Delbert, he's a-comin'. - What's the trouble? - Ain't no trouble. Lessen you fixin' on startin' some. - Why Delbert Huggins, I see you done misplaced your chauffeur's cap. - You gonna misplace you some teeth, you sass me one more time, boy. - Boy, howdy, you sure one tough hombre. - Now this here is what you call (weapon clicking) a business meeting. - Call it anything you like, Delbert. Call it anything you like. - Well, we'll call it business, that way, you see, there ain't no hard feelings. Now, Miss Stark, she ain't got nothin' against you personal. It's that she don't like a bunch of nickel-and-dime shine runners. You understand? - I think Vivian Stark have enough to do what with keepin' her crooked little fingers in every swill pot in the county. - (scoffs) Well, taking care of the competition's the way she stay on top. Now get outta that car. - Right now? - Right now. - Sure thing. (rapid country music) (pained grunting) - Hey, hey, hey, wait, what you doing? Hey, hold on. No! Ah! Now, then, no, it's a joke! We just kiddin'! (terrified wailing) Come on! What are you waitin' for, instant replay? Come on, you mangy hairballs, let's get that guy! Come on! Let's go, let's go. Yee-haw, let's get that boy! Yee-haw, come on, let's get him! (maniacal laughing) Come on! Lock up the women, here we come! (laughing) Woo! Come on, man is this the best you can drive this, Paul? - [Dusty] Ya! Ya, ha ha! (rifle booming) - Ah, missed him! Hold this thing steady, will ya? - Time for a taste of the claw. - Hey, look out, that thing, look out! (passengers yelling) - Woo! Ya! - [Delbert] You guys okay back there? - [Man] I'm okay, you're okay? - [Man] I'm okay. - [Man] Delbert, we're okay. - [Man] Delbert, you okay? - [Delbert] I don't know! - Hm, take up slack. - Yep. Well, now I know why I went to Nashville. - Puts hair on your chest, honey. - (laughing) Don't want no hair on my chest, else I'd be in a sideshow. - Well, it might be a cut above the nudist camp. - Knock, knock, anybody home? - Howdy, Dusty. Y'all remember my sister, (kiss smacking) Lorette? - Hi. - Boy, howdy, someone went and growed up when we wasn't lookin'. - You're doing enough lookin' now to make up for lost time. - I can't help it if I like what I see. - Once sister at a time, cave-dweller. Will you help us with this? Here. - Sure, it'd be a pleasure. - Right there. - This the outfit you picked up yesterday? - Mm hmm, folks called this morning, said they'd let it go for 500. - [Dusty] Oh, you made out like a bandit. - Sue Lynn? - [Sue Lynn] Well, howdy, Orville. What can I do you for? - Well, you don't have to do nothin', but this here's a warrant for us to search this place. - Dave, check the garage. Hank, take a look at those cars out in the back lot. - Search us, for what? - Well, there ain't no telling. If you're anything like your daddy, there's probably a still in this cellar. - If you was anything like your daddy, I'd just give you a couple jars of shine, and you'd be on your way. - Tyree, I'm gonna nail your hide to the barn door one of these days. But this here don't concern you. Hm, look like we got one right here. Red '78, serial numbers the same. - I just bought the car this morning. - You got a bill of sale? - I'm not a thief, Orville. I got a call yesterday to pick it up. - Chief, we got 'em now. I found four hot cars parked in the lot and a souped-up coup rigged to run shine. - Looks like there's some rotten Peaches in the barrel. I'm takin' you all in. - Now hold on, Orville. - Tyree, you were born guilty. - We're being framed. Vivian Stark set this up. - Let's go, come on. - [Lorette] Well, I think I was better off in the dadgum nudist colony. (jailhouse harmonica music) - Boy, oh boy, I can't believe this. I mean, I cannot believe it. I mean, I'm bad. I'm madder than a cat in gunny sack. Hey, deputy? Hey, deputy, let us outta here. (cup clanking) You hear me? I'm gonna get a lawyer and sue the county for everything it's worth. Now I demand we be released. - Have you gone crazy? - Deputy, you hear me? You get in here and let us outta here! I demand we be released! You hear me? Or I'm gonna get a lawyer and sue this county for everything it's worth. Hear me, I'm hot. I'm really hot! Deputy! - [Deputy] Y'all are free to go. - Yeah, well, you made the right decision, old boy. Yeah, girls, you just stick with old Dusty. He'll take care of ya. - Your bail's been posted. - [Dusty] Bail, what, what? - [Sue Lynn] Let's just get outta here. (low string music) - Boy howdy, I was beginning to consider pleading insanity to get outta there. - You'd have no trouble proving that. Who paid our bail, I wonder. - I think we're fixin' to find out. - No, let go of me! - Okay, all right. All right, all right. - Let go of me! - [Lorette] Let go of my hair. - [Sue Lynn] Let go! - [Lorette] Let go of me! (tense instrumental music) - [Man] Move out. Move it along. - [Sue Lynn] Let go of me, bozo. - [Lorette] What's goin' on? Where are you taking us? - [Dusty] Hey, take it easy now. I bruise. (low sinister music) - I don't know where we are. - Whatever you come up with, I'll agree. - [Dusty] Look, I'm ready. - Boy, you kids got yourselves in a real pack of trouble. My name's Dukane, Randolph Dukane, US Treasury Department. Seeing the trouble you got yourselves in, I thought maybe you might like to make a deal with the United States government. - We didn't do nothin'. - Well, seein' how as one of them stolen cars came from out of state, you didn't do nothin' to the tune of a federal offense. - That wasn't my car. - Hold on, now, I don't know anything about-- - I didn't have nothin' to do with it. We just got a call to tow it. - Oh, come on. - They got a good case against you, whether you did it or not. - Well, we'll just get ourselves a good lawyer. - Yeah, best damn lawyer in the state of Georgia. - What are you gonna use for money? Spare parts? Now listen, I'm working on a case of national import involving a crime ring so insidious that its tentacles spread to every state east of the Mississippi. - Sounds real bad. - Well, it's worse than you can imagine. It's costing the taxpayers of this country millions of dollars every year. An invisible empire is picking our pockets just as we talk right now. - Wow. - I'm talking about the illicit transportation of tobacco products in order to avoid state excise tax. - What? - Bootleg butts. (girls laughing) - Woo-hoo, that's great. - Oh, no! - Smugglin' smokes, crime of the century. - Well, now, listen, it's a real serious situation. Just one truckload costs this country $75,000 in evaded taxes. - Got yourself a problem, but what's that got to do with us? - Well, I've been doing some checking up on you kids. How would you like to work undercover for me? - You mean bein' in the wrong place at the wrong time. - Who's got time to play James Bond? I've got a business to run. - Well, if you're convicted of car theft, your garage will be confiscated and sold at public auction. - Well, I can just guess who the buyer would be. - [Sue Lynn] Vivian Stark. - Vivian Stark? Vivian Stark's my main lead. - She's in on this smokes smuggling thing? - And the other night, I busted a load of bootleg butts the night before you were arrested. The truck was leased from Vivian Stark's truck and transfer company. - Well, why don't you bust her, then? - Well, I don't have enough on her. Now, Dusty, I'd like you to get a job working for the Dixie Transfer company, and I want you to girls to get a line on the Charleston nightclub district. We think it's a distribution center. - This sounds crazy to me. - Well, your only other choice is to walk outta here and straight back to jail. You can say goodbye to your singing. Your stock cars, bye-bye. That sweet little garage of yours, you can just kiss it goodbye and let Vivian Stark win another one. - Well, you're saying that they'll drop all the charges? - You'll have the whole US Treasury Department behind you. - Oh, great, we'll be as big a hit as the $2 bill. What do you think, Lorette? - Well, singing in the penitentiary somehow just ain't my idea of a class act. ♪ Oh, fetched from the kitchen ♪ In an old slop pail ♪ And that's how they serve you ♪ ♪ In the Mount Holly jail ♪ And it's hard time ♪ In the Mount Holly jail ♪ And it's hard times ♪ In the Mount Holly Jail - Oo, get you. - Well, I sure like singing about jail a lot more than I like being in one. - Amen, they was fixin' to throw away the key on us. - Yep, my ma always told me I'd land in a heap of trouble if I hung out with wild women. - Oh. - Oh, you don't need a woman to point you towards trouble, Dusty. - That a fact, well, I was doin' just fine 'til you asked me to help out in the garage. - You call runnin' shine something to be proud of, don't you, yeah? - Mm hmm, yeah. - Oh, you guys, quit squabbling. I mean, they're on the same team, now. - Yeah, well, we may be on the same team, but we sure as heck in last place. - Oh, shut up, born to lose. - Oh, let's stop and get something. - Yeah, I could use a bite myself. - I can't take this another sec. - Yeah? - [Sue Lynn] Yeah. - [Dusty] Hm. - Ow! - Not too bad, a little too much pepper, but it's better than barbecue. - Okay, another 10 miles-- - How about another one? - And we'll be at that Truckadero Dukane told us about. - [Lorette] Yeah, here we go, woo! (truck horn honking) (low country music) - Hey, now what is this one? (imitates bird singing) - Uh, turkey buzzard. (patrons chattering) - Hey, sonny, is that your idea of a double date? Now if you got your hands full and need some help, you just give me a shout. - Girls, hear somebody say something? - I better warn you straight off that my cook quit me last week, so we ain't got nothing but sandwiches. - What about eggs? - I got plenty of ingredients, it's just I'm a little short on talent. - Well, talent's my middle name. You mind if I go back there and rustle something up to eat? - Oh, oh, no, no, be my guest. As long as you pay for what you burn, you're sure welcome to give 'er a try. - Yeah, thank you. - All right now, ladies, see if you can guess this here, when it's something that you hear every day. (clears throat) (imitates bird calling) - A teakettle? - A busted differential? - Oh, no. Y'all disappoint me. Now, that is a yellow-bellied sapsucker. - You're kidding. - Oh, absolutely. Yeah, now, do you wanna hear a Kirtland's warbler? - I'd much rather get a pack of cigarettes. Do you have any? - Oh, no, I'm sorry. My machine broke. - Yeah, just like everything else in this crummy place. Here you go, little darlin'. You have one of mine, on the house. - Thank you. - Why don't you tend to business, Tweety Bird. Hey, hi. - [Dusty] There ya go. - Mm. You make pretty good food, boy. You do housecleaning, too? Gimme a cup of coffee. - Black or cream and sugar? - Black and hot. - Oh, it's hot. - [Ed] Ya! (rapid music) (furniture clattering) - Oh, I got 20. The boy's gonna take the big dude. - You're on, Big Bird. - [Man] Oo, you got him mad now, boy. He's gonna tear your face off. - [Sue Lynn] Don't let him hurt ya, Dusty. (effortful grunting) Get back, get back! (punch thudding) - [Man] Hey, now, all right. - [Man] Hit him again! - [Man] Like that. (pained grunting) - I'm gonna cut you, boy. You're gonna bleed. - Ed! Ed! You're through with Dixie. Now you pack your stuff and get out. - This ain't over, boy. This ain't over. - It is for you, Ed. You move it, now. - Thanks for your help. Listen, appears that you got an opening at Dixie Truck and Transfer. I'd like to apply for the job. - I don't hire nobody without a recommendation, son. - Lay that money right in there, gentlemen. I do so appreciate it. - Be all right, honey? - Golly. - Yeah. I'm feeling a little better now. - [Lorette] Well, you gonna feel even better when you see what we got for you. - Yeah, what's that? - Pack of butts that gorilla laid on me. Look at the tax stamp. - Connecticut. - Connecticut, that's what Randy Dukane said. It has the highest tax rate of all. - And ain't it a little weird, a North Carolina boy toting around Yank smokes? - Probably filched it from that load he was hauling. - Why I think it's counterfeit. Look, the ink's all smudged. - Mm, appears the trails getting warmer. That big bozo worked for Dixie Truck and Transfer. I think I ought to stick around here and keep an eye on things for a while. - Yeah, what about us? - You all go down to Charleston, check out the nightclubs, like we planned. - [Barker] Hey, polyester, come on in, this here's your kinda show. See 50 daring and titillating tigers of Trumbo Street. - We can't hear anything in the audience. - She, she rates it. - We gotta get backstage. - How? - Equates it and makes all kinds of-- - Well, these places are always looking for dancers. - [Barker] Come on in! - Well, what if it's a topless bar? - Well, you know, you got all the right equipment. - I'll keep it under wraps, thank you. Don't they hire waitresses the same as the dancers? - Yeah, but in these joints, the waitresses go topless. - You been to too many nudist colonies, you know, mouth? - And you been hiding out in the garage too long, girl. That's your problem. Hey. This is the place. I think I got an idea how we can keep our clothes on.

We can learn a lot from those two guys. - I already got plenty on Jarvis. - Oh, and I'm gonna need a federal bench warrant. This is the big one. (phone ringing) Dukane speaking. - Mr. Dukane, this Sue Lynn Peach, we're in a club in Charleston called The Big Wheel. Now this place is owned by a low-life named Jarvis Wheeler, and it's a front for bootleg butt distribution. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I saw the setup myself, tonight. - [Dukane] Good girl. - Me and Lorette's been working as a singing act. The trouble is, this guy, Jarvis, he wants us to come entertain on this big yacht at his friend's. - Well, what's the problem? - Well, there's no problem. I just thought our job was done, is all. - Oh, now, listen, you're doing a great job, but I want you to go to that party. I mean, it's a wonderful opportunity. There's no telling what you might discover. - I don't know, Mr. Dukane. - Well, it sure wouldn't hurt when your case comes to trial. I'll tell you that. Might even mean a full pardon. - All right, all right, you don't need to twist my arm anymore. Just a sec. Honey, why don't you go out and stall them two off for a while. I'll be there just a second. - Oh, sure thing, sis. - How's Dusty? - Well, as a matter of fact, old Dusty's headed down your way. He's driving a load of bootleg butts down to Charleston. - When? - Tonight. - Well, one down, but where's your sister? I hope she's not sick or anything. - Well, she had to do, you know, feminine things. Uh, why don't you pour me a little champagne to make the time pass a little more quickly. - Oo. - Well, my pleasure. (chuckling) There you go. - Oh, a lady just loves it when a handsome gentleman performs such a special courtesy. - Well, isn't that just nice? - He's headed down Interstate 26, and he ought to be there at pier 10 around 5:05 a.m. I'm gonna have four armed men standing by and units on call. They'll never know what hit 'em. I tell you, it's gonna be a complete surprise. - Oh, yeah? Oh, listen, I gotta go. They're waitin' on me. You don't let Dusty get hurt now, okay? - Well, nothing's gonna happen to Dusty, but you girls be careful now. - Okay, bye. - Yes, sir, Tom, I tell you, this is the big one. Yeah, get me the regional director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. - Sorry. - What in tarnation took you so long, huh? - Modesty does not permit an answer, sir. - Pier five, driver. - So I just thought I'd tip you big-time crime busters off to a party the underworld's holding tonight in a yacht in Charleston Harbor. Over here at Treasury, we do more than print money, you know. - [FBI] The name of the yacht's the Blackjack. Our informants tipped us off weeks ago. (Dukane choking) (chuckling) You better hope your people don't get in the way. One of my best, I mean my best agents is on the case.

Go make the introductions. - Mkay. Stop the music. Stop the music. - But we're not through with our numbers, yet. - Your number's up, lady, take a powder. Now let's hear a great big round of applause for the fantastic Honeysuckle sisters from Nashville, my latest discovery. (audience applauding) And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I present our guest of honor, Miss Vivian Stark. - Boy, our gooses are cooked for sure, now. - We gotta get out of here. - Hey. (distant cheering) Boy, I feel like a pussy cat at a dog show. - Sh, somebody's coming. - [Vivian] Perfectly charming evening, Captain. - Just a few old friends wishing to pay their respects, my dear. - Why thank you. (upbeat instrumental music) - Sue Lynn, in here. - [Vivian] I do need a word with you in private, Captain. - [Wade] Yes, well, that's why I suggested my cabin. Nothing could be more intimate than that. - We're trapped? - Well, isn't this nice, Captain? But business must always come before pleasure. - Oh, of course. Champagne? - I simply cannot tolerate that frog water. However, four fingers of Kentucky bourbon would do me nicely, thank you. - [Wade] Of course, my dear. - Tough old buzzard. - To you and your beautiful eyes, brighter than the brightest gemstones. - My eyes would brighten considerably if I knew the diamonds were here. - Well, now, you know Mr. Marco better than that. I don't suppose that you brought the money along. - You see me lugging a two-ton purse? It's on it's way. Finger Point at noon tomorrow, just like we agreed upon. - Perfect. Perfect. Mr. Marco's bringing a helicopter in for the pick up. The diamonds will be aboard. I would like to make another toast to your brilliance. To the mastermind that thought up one of the greatest and certainly the sweetest heist this country has ever seen. - [Vivian] And to the most dashing pirates in the Southern seas. - Well, now, honey. Pirate just ain't nothin' without his treasure. - Indeed. - Oh, I'd walk the plank with you any day. - Well, you make the idea sound most appealing, Captain, but I think it best that we get back to the festivities. Come along (coy giggling) - My heart's beating faster than the rhythm section. We gotta abandon ship. - I second that motion. We gotta tell Dukane about the diamonds and money business. - The coast is clear, let's go. - Uh, just, 'scuse me. You're not leaving so soon. How 'bout having this dance with me, beautiful? - Well, I'd love to, but I've gotta go. - When I ask a little gal to dance, she dances. - No, you don't understand. See, it's not my sister don't wanna dance, it's just that-- - Darlin', she don't seem to mind. - Sue Lynn, you go on ahead. I'll be there shortly. - Okay, I'll be waiting at the car. 10 minutes, okay? - 'Kay. (rapid dance music) - Yes, ma'am, Miss Stark, me and the old Captain here have been friends longer than an elephant would care to remember. You might say that we are thicker than thieves. - Uh, yes, well, I'd put that just a little differently if I were you, Jarvis. - You're a sensible man, Captain. - There's one of my little songbirds right now. Come on in here with me, honey. I've got a very important lady that I want to introduce you to. Miss Stark, this here is Miss Lorette Plum, one half of the Honeysuckle sisters, soon to be famous. Ain't she just about as sweet as pecan pie, now, huh? - How do you do? - Pleasure to meet you, ma'am. - [Jarvis] Where is Sue Lynn, sweetheart. - Oh, she could be anywhere. - Have I seen you somewhere before, Miss Lorette Plum? - I don't think so. Have you ever been in Nashville? - Your face looks so familiar. - Well, maybe you caught our act somewhere. Listen, it was really nice to meet you. Come on, Bobby Lee, I thought you wanted to dance. - I've seen your sister's act, but I'd sure like to see yours, Miss Peach. - Oh, the name's Plum. I think you got your fruits mixed up. - Hold onto her, Bobby Lee! - You take it easy on my nightingale now, Miss Stark. - Shut up, Jarvis. You're the mangy dog brought home the fleas in the first place. Now I want some answers. I want 'em straight and fast. Where's your sister? (slap cracking) - She's someplace where you'll never get your hands on her. - I think I saw her get off the boat. - Who sent you here? How'd you get outta jail, huh? (slap cracking) Huh? Okay, nightingale, you just sing your song. - Miss Vivian, I think I have a perfect solution to this problem if you would care to take a short stroll with me, belowdecks? - Okay, Captain, you lead the way. Get rid of the guests. Let's get underway, Captain. (phone ringing) (rapid, tense music) - [Lorette] Oh! - Spend the time on ice, just let it setting your own teeth chattering, young lady. - Oh, no! - Excellent, Captain. Just another piece of cold meat unless she starts talking fast. - I ain't got nothin' to say to you. - Cooling your heels just might change your mind. - [Lorette] No! - Breaker 1-9, Dusty? Dusty Tyree, you got copy? - I don't want her suffocating in there, Captain. - Oh, no need to worry. Now just you keep still in there, else this lid'll slam shut and you'll choke to death inside of 10 minutes. - I need to use your phone while she's on ice, Captain. - Oh, there's a ship-to-shore in my cabin. - Thank you. - Keep an eye on things. See that she don't get out. (engine revving) - Joe Don, it's me. Everything set? Good. Look, we've run into a little snag on this end, nothing real serious. Who's driving? - Got a new boy, named Steve. Ah, he's sort of blonde, says he used to race stock cars. Yes, ma'am, that's him. - [Vivian] Your mother raised a fool! He ain't no Steve! That is Dusty Tyree, and he is trouble. - Miss Stark-- - He's gonna bust the whole setup wide open, you idiot! - Miss Stark? I promise you I will drop that Tyree boy like a treed coon struck by lightening. (pistol clicking) (tense instrumental music) - [Sue Lynn] Dusty! Dusty, stop! (horn honking) Am I glad to see you! - How you doin', hon? (irritated whimpering) - Cut it out, Dusty. This aint the time or place for backseat ballet, right now. - Hm? How'd you find me? - Dukane said you was haulin' a load of butts to Charleston. - Where's Lorette? - That's just it, I don't know. We was singin' for this gangster jamboree on this big yacht, and Vivian Stark showed up, so we knew it was time to go. So, I was supposed to meet Lorette back at the car. Well, she never made it. - You tell this to Dukane? - I couldn't reach him. Vivian Stark's mixed up in diamonds, and they got some money deal going on. - Well, we got the goods on her this time. We'll see how she likes it behind bars. - Well, they gotta catch her first. Come on, let's load this bike up. - All right. - Well, I think it's time that we had a look at our little Popsicle. - Well, peach is my favorite flavor. - Well, young lady, are you ready to answer some questions? - I got nothin' to say. - [Vivian] Put her back. - Can't do that, now. She'll freeze to death in the next couple of minutes. - Save us the trouble of slitting her throat. - Well, she can't do much talking with her throat cut. Now I got a better idea. - [Vivian] I sincerely hope you do, Captain. - Well, it's an old, nautical tradition. Bobby Lee, gimme a hand here. (Lorette moaning) - [Sue Lynn] I thought you said you was haulin' butts. - Course there's bootleg, honey. You don't think they'd pay me a grand for regular run? How 'bout a smoke? (awed whistling) Take a look at that. - This must be the money Vivian Stark was talking about. There's gotta be millions in here. - 10 grand in this pack alone. - Well, won't Mr. Dukane be tickled red, white, and blue? - I never seen money this new before. - Dusty, you better not think what you're thinkin'. - Boy could live awful high on the hog and not even spend a half of it. - Well, you ain't no hog, and you're not spending a dime of this loot. - Oh, Sue Lynn, honey, who's gonna miss a few little old bundles? Probably take 'em a year to count it all as it is. - Dusty Ty, I'm ashamed of you. Here you are workin' for Uncle Sam. You're thinking like Vivian Stark. - Well, sure was sweet coppin' a feel of it. Oughta be a reward or something. - Keeping yourself outta jail will be reward enough for you. (somber nautical music) - Let her splash, Bobby Lee. (Lorette screaming) - [Vivian] Yeah, try not to think about that big shark swimming down there, honey. (thumping eerie music) - Rise and shine, honey, we're here. Just crossed the city line. - Okay, you better drop me off here. I gotta see if Lorette made it back to the car okay. - Lookee here, if Lorette's still on that boat, don't you go doing anything crazy. I'll bring Dukane and his boys soon as he shows over at the warehouse. - The boat's docked at pier five. (tense instrumental music) (somber instrumental music) Shoot! (brakes hissing) - Alec, you get the rest of the guys. Unload that baby, pronto. Take the boxes, put 'em in the back of my van. Warm up, too. - Right on time, Mr. Carter. I believe I still got half a paycheck coming. - Oh, now don't you worry, Steve. You gonna get everything you deserve. - I just want what's due me, that's all. - Sure, that's only fair. Here's the first installment. (punch thudding) Dusty. With interest. - Yeah, you're real tough when it's three against one, ain't ya? - Oh, I hadn't even started to get tough, cracker. I'm just warming up. (pained yelping) Tell me who you workin' for. - Dixie Truck and Transfer, but I just quit. - [Joe Don] Let's try it again without the cute answers. - I ain't gonna tell you nothing. - Oh, I think you will. Now you spit it out. Who you workin' for? (pistol clicking) - He's working for me, Randolph Dukane, US Treasury Department. Get your hands up before I blow you into next week. You're all under arrest if you ain't guessed that by now. - Spread 'em, you know the position. - Now move 'em out. - Oh, boy, am I ever glad to see you. - Are you all right? Dusty, I'm sorry it took me so long to get here. - Yeah, me too. - All right, read 'em their rights, Lieutenant Smith. I wanna feast my eyes on a load of bootleg. - [Smith] You have the right to remain silent-- - I hate to disappoint you, Dukane, but that wasn't butts I was haulin'. - What? - Court of law. - Come here a minute. - You have the right to an attorney and to have an attorney during questioning. - You mean we don't have a (stammering) case here? - Well, not unless a few million bucks in brand new cash might interest you. - The Atlanta heist. - I reckon. They offloaded everything and put it right in that van, there. - Well, let's just have ourselves a look. (rifles clicking) - You guys is ground meat if you so much as breathe. (tense instrumental music) - Well, now, it looks like a little Mexican standoff with the T-man, doesn't it? Why don't you do yourself a favor, have your boys drop the heat. (revolvers clattering) (brakes squealing) (engine rumbling) (weapons booming) - They got Lorette in a place called Finger Point! - [Both] Yee-haw! - Hey, up there, Bobby Lee, can you hear me? Hear me? - What you want? - Get me outta here. I'll talk, I swear! - Now that's more like it. You hang on, darlin'. I'll have you up here quicker than a hound dog honeymoon. - Dukane to central. Now listen, I'm gonna need that assist. Oh, oh, and listen. Put out an APB on a late model blue van. That's right. - Oh. - Woo, looks like I done caught myself a puredee mermaid. - Untie these ropes. - Oh, comin' up, darlin'. Comin' up. There you go. We'll just take off your little jacket. Woo-ee, doll, that wet look fits you to a T. - You like that, huh? - You bet I like it. Hey! (frightened wailing) (birds singing) - Yep, there's Finger Point, 'bout 45 miles up the road. - Isn't that your friend from the warehouse up ahead? - [Dusty] Yeah, that's him all right. - Well, let's surprise him. (rapid country music) (heavy thumping) - Yah! Get him again, honey, get him again. - Gee! - Atta girl. - [Sue Lynn] Oh, no! - [Dusty] You got it, you got it! - Oh, it's a bad end for you, darlin'. (engine revving) - Oh, boy, I really done it now. - Oh, honey, you sure did. Woo, perfect time for the trusty claw. (explosive booming) (Dusty and Sue Lynn cheering) - We got him! - Who did? Woo! Hi. I owe you something. Sue Lynn, tie this turkey up. There's some electricity tape in the back. - What have you got in mind, Dusty? Oh, Dusty, no! - Now, now, it ain't how it looks. - It looks bad. - They got Lorette, but we got the cash. I'd say things are lookin' real good. - [Radio] Dukane to Dusty Tyree. Come in, Dusty. - Yeah, this is Dusty. Listen, they got Lorette prisoner on a big ol' yacht called the Blackjack. They're headed up the coast now for a place called Finger Point. - Mr. Dukane, this is Sue Lynn. - I read you. - Vivian Stark's onboard the Blackjack with a whole bunch of crooks, and the boat's owned by a man named Holt, and me and Lorette, we heard 'em talkin' about stolen and money and diamonds. - All right, now listen. That's wonderful work, but I want you kids to back off now, you hear me? Let the department take over. - They've got Lorette. - [Dukane] I want you to back off now. - Over and out. - Dukane to central. Now listen, the big one's still on. I'm gonna need five helicopters plus areal reconnaissance, a backup team of 50 federal marshals, plus ground transport and... All right, 30 marshals, then. Two highway patrolmen? What do you mean, no helicopters? Can't I just have one copter? Savannah? Columbus? Too far. - I hope you got some kinda plan, Dusty. - Well, if we can get to Finger Point before the Blackjack, we're in business. - Let's hustle then, 'cause it's due in at noon. We got less than an hour. - Yeah, well, gimme a hand. - All right, listen. Call the Coast Guard. I want a Coast Guard cutter with an armed taskforce ready to go in five minutes. (stammering) Can't I just have one cutter? (engine revving) (gentle guitar music) - We have all the latest in navigational equipment: radar, sonar, LORAN, the works. Hey there, little lady. What y'all doin' down there? - Okay, you guys just hold it right there. What we're gonna do is turn this little tub around and set a new course. - Well, just what course would you like me to set? - Back to Charleston, and I don't want any arguments 'cause I'm calling all the shots now. - Oh, now, no arguments intended, my dear. It's just hard to call the shots when two of my men are standing right behind you. - Oh, try another one. That's the oldest trick in the world. (revolver blasts) - Well, my dear, sometimes the oldest tricks are the best ones. Take her below. Put her in the engine room. - Mr. Marco, after we finish our business, would you be kind enough to dispose of that little problem for me? - No problem. We just swing the chopper out to sea and drop her. (sirens wailing) (tense music) - Let's go, fella. - Mr. Dukane, welcome aboard. Ready when you are. - Is that it? - Yes, sir. - All right. Let's go. (engine rumbling) (siren wailing) - [Sue Lynn] Are we about there? - I hope so, it's almost 12. Yeah, here we be. There's the dock, and there's Vivian Stark's limo. (gentle instrumental music) (soft chortling) (water splashing) (swimmer gigging) - Woo! Woo! Hey, would you all handing me something to wear? - Here you go, pretty thing, and I'll be real sure to avert my eyes at the proper moment. (chuckling) - Yoo-hoo. - [Delbert] What? (pained grunt) - This here is what you'd call a business meeting, Delbert old boy. Honey, try and raise Dukane, if you'll pardon the expression. I gotta start setting things up. Woof! - There's my limo. Money must be in those boxes. - No one's around. I don't like it. - Maybe they're answering the call of nature. - All at once? It's not natural. - Well, we'll bring her in, nice and easy now. (engine revving) - Sue Lynn Peach to Randy Dukane, come in, Dukane. Sue Lynn Peach to Randy Dukane, come in, please. - [Radio] This is Dukane, over. - This is Sue Lynn, where you been? We're at the dock of an abandoned fishery outside of Rantowles, about a mile. - [Dukane] All right, we're gonna be there in about five minutes. Now I just want you to lay low and keep outta sight. All right, pour it on, Skipper. - [Skipper] It's full ahead, now, sir. - [Dukane] Well, just keep revvin' it up. (helicopter whirring) - You were early. My boys are right on time. - Why, Marco, let's go compliment him on his punctuality. Delbert? Joe Don? I'm here. Where the hell is everybody? - Perfect, Eddie. Now I got the rocks right here, but I don't see no cash. - Joe Don? Where the hell are you? - Joe Don couldn't make it, got all tied up. - Who is that? - Don't matter, shoot him. - Now don't do nothing stupid. There's a few million bucks in them boxes right there, and I soaked it down real good with gasoline, so if anybody so much as looks at a gun, I'll shoot this flare at it and you'll have the world's most expensive barbecue. - Hold the heat, boys. What is it you want? - Lorette Peach. Consider the money as her ransom. - She the singer? - That's her. - Get the girl! - She so much as has a hair out of place and you boys can roast marshmallows on your money. - Now, don't worry, honey, she's unharmed. - Hey, Dusty. - How ya doin', kid? - Better and better. - All right, now here's what's gonna happen: nobody moves, Lorette walks over here, all by herself, she gets in, and we drive away. And the money's all yours. - It's a deal. Start walking, chippy. (tense instrumental music) - That's it, honey, keep a-comin'. - When she gets to the car, let 'em both have it. (engine revving) Where'd she come from? - Look out, ah! - [Sue Lynn] Get on, let's go! - Get 'em! - Shoot 'em, shoot 'em! (Vivian drown out by cycle) - Hit 'em in the hearts, boys! (pistols banging) Stop them! He's getting away! (explosive banging) All right, all right, knock it off. Get 'em from the air in a minute. - Look at my car! - This ice'll buy you a fleet of 'em. All right, boys, get the cash. Put out that cigarette! They were smooth, those kids. - It's empty, boss. They're all empty. - Double-crossing tramp! - I don't know what's going on, but I want those diamonds and I want them now. Either one of you guys touch your piece, I waste Marco here. Now, hand it to me real slow. You're a classy gent, Marco. - How do you think you're gettin' outta here with no car? - I'm gonna borrow your pilot, and your chopper. (quick country music) It's them again. - Get outta the way! (Vivian screaming) No time, get in the chopper! - Damn you! - [Marco] Get the ice! Let's get outta here! - I'll handle this one. - Marco, you give me back my diamonds! They're my diamonds! - I owe you for that bath, little lady. - What are you doing? You get away from me! - [Dusty] Yee haw! (startled yelping) Bath time, boys! (pistol banging) - Go, go! Go after him, he's got my money! - [Vivian] You'll never get, get away from me! Ah! You give me back my diamonds, you little hussy, Lorette Peach. - To the left, to the left! (siren wailing) - Line's away. Now back her off. - [Dukane] All right, drop those weapons. You're in the custody of the United States Treasury Department, any attempt to resist arrest will be met with force. - Over, over! (pistol banging) What's he swinging? - Yeah! - [Pilot] He hit us with something. - Go! Go! - Go where? We're tied down! - [Marco] He's pulling us toward the trees! Pull back! - [Pilot] We're pullin' back! - [Marco] Give it full power! - [Pilot] We're losing power! - [Marco] We're goin' down! (yelling) Ah! Oh! Get clear! Get clear! (explosive booming) (siren wailing) (triumphant music) - [Dusty] Mr. Marco? - [Soldier] Show the men. (soldiers yelling) - [Soldier] Get that copter. We got the spares in route. - [Solder] He'll be at the risk perimeter, Corporal. Where that chopper gonna land? Move it! Double time! - [Soldier] Armory 53 reporting, Mr. Dukane, sir! - What's your name, Captain? - Captain Avent, sir. - I ordered five helicopters, not one. Next time, why don't you come prepared? Or just don't bother to come at all. - Sir. - [Soldier] This way, keep your hands in sight. - [Soldier] Hold it right there. We'll take it from here. - Yeah. - [Dukane] Well, now, I only got one question. - [Soldier] Search 'em. - Where's the money? (all laughing) - Well, it's safe and sound. I picked the sweetest hiding place you ever did see. (chipper harmonica music) (bees buzzing) I figured this one out when I was runnin' shine. See, the bee colony always lives in the bottom of the hive. Now, when I had a few jugs to hide, well, I'd just add empty supers to the top of the hive and stash my jugs right there. - I'll tell you one thing, the department sure will be grateful. - Well, I kinda hate to say it, but I'm gonna miss all this excitement. - Yeah, it was sorta fun, kinda like winning a big race. - Yeah, well, the best thing of all is that Vivian Stark is behind bars. - Yeah! - Amen! Well, I tell you what, let's celebrate a little. - Yoo! - Wow. God. - Well, I never had my honey off the money before, but there's always a first time. - [Dusty] How sweet it is.
