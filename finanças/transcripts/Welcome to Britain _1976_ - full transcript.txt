(Man) They don't like my coming over here. I've come over here as a visitor. For about three weeks. I've got my parents over here. I've got my brothers over here, sisters over here. And what happened exactly? What happened when you got to Heathrow Airport? They've only one attitude. They're not interested in people coming over here, whether as a visitor or as an immigrant or as any damn thing. If they wanted me to be a visitor over here like I requested them, I've got enough of friends to prove that I am a genuine visitor over here. I've got a brother who is here for last about... seven to eight years. I'd never seen him. I left him as a baby over here. And there I am now over here, I just can't meet him. I can't see my house where my people live. I exercise the benefit of the doubt more than any other minister that we've ever had in charge of immigration. But if we did it in every single case there wouldn't be immigration control. Anybody could come in. Now, the fact of the matter is that there's a serious pressure to come and settle in this country from certain areas of the Commonwealth. It's irrefutable. If... When I was in Bangladesh at the beginning of the year, I went into one village and I said to the men in the village, "How many people here would like "to come and live in England?" He said, "The whole village." The fact of the matter is there is a substantial pressure and we cannot take them all, and therefore a control system has to be applied. Now, once you get to that stage, there are difficult problems when you get to the borderline. There are some cases that are absolutely plain. But there are some cases when you're on the borderline. You're not absolutely sure one way or the other. And we do exercise the benefit of the doubt in a great many cases, and sometimes we make mistakes. That has to be the case in any human system. Now, what I am anxious to do is to limit the number of mistakes and particularly to limit any kind of suggestion that the motivation is wrong, that it should be racialist or restrictive or in some other way seeking to frustrate the rights of those who have to come. Can I speak to extension 2-6... You're the Home Office, aren't you? (Woman) 'That's right.' 2-6-2-2. 'Right.' (Man) '2-6-2-2?' - Mr Potts? - 'Speaking.' Mr Potts, good morning. Mr Davis. 'Mr Davis, yes?' You got a minute to spare? 'Not really, no. I'm very busy, I'm afraid.' You're very busy? 'I'm going to put you onto the telephone enquiry bureau...' No, no, no, no, no! This is very important, - and before I... - 'I'm very sorry, Mr Davis, 'but if you want to ask me a question, 'I suggest that you ring the telephone enquiry line...' But this concerns you... This concerns you and a letter you wrote to me. 'I'm sure it does concern me, 'but I just do not have time to deal with it at the moment, 'and I suggest you ring the telephone enquiry...' Mr Potts, I suggest you change your name to Mr Schmuck. That's what I suggest. 'You do that, Mr Reuben Davis.' (Click) That's it. Mr Potts. You know him? (Woman) 'He's one of the... 'um... officers in one of our case-working groups, I think.' Yeah, well, Mr Potts refused to vary her leave. 'Mm-hm?' And to give her a right of abode. 'Mm.' And the next thing I have here, I wrote again, because I thought he must have made a mistake. Now, this old lady, she can't have any children. She's 68 years of age. She can't breed any kids. You should give her a bit of rest and peace. 'Mm.' And I've got this letter from him. 'Mm?' "Dear sir, re. Mrs Eleni Charalambous. "I refer to the appeal made by the above name "against the Secretary of State's decision "to refuse her request to be allowed "to remain permanently in the United Kingdom. "Taking all the facts into consideration, "it has been decided to maintain the refusal." Now, I'm sure that the Secretary of State has personally... if he was personally involved, he would go mad. I know that because I know he's a man of compassion, and I know he wouldn't treat the widows of British soldiers like this in this manner. But I'm sure... Mr Potts, I don't know why he refused this. Now, could I take it to somebody else? Because if it goes to an appeal court, you'll be the laughing stock of everybody. It'll be disgraceful, inhumane, and the British people are not inhumane. Your mother has the right to have abode in this country. Yes? But unfortunately in the Home Office they have a lot of young boys and girls - working there... - (Barber) Yes? ...who don't know the difference between arsehole time and breakfast time. They make decisions on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State, he doesn't know what's going on. I'm sure the Home Secretary, he knows about this case, or the Minister, Mr Alex Lyon, he'll have no difficulty. At the moment we're waiting for an appeal. We have the right of appeal, and when the appeal comes, then we'll see. Yes. Before she came here, where was she? She was used to live in the camp, in the tent, you know? And, er... (Mr Davis) That's why the Home Office didn't want to send her back in the tent. (Barber laughs) Not going to have an abortion, is she, or anything? Not going to have a baby, is she? No, no, no. Jesus. (Mr Davis) That's why they send them back, you see. Send young girls back or women back who are gonna have abortions, - free medical treatment. - Nice. She's almost 70 now, you know. Well, they're mad up there. They're mad up in the Home Office. Stark raving mad. Old lady, she wants somebody to look after her, you know? Peace and quiet. Is she a good cook? Er, in my... yes. Is very good cook. All right, then. I'm looking for a good cook. So even if I marry her myself, she'll stay in the country. All right, then, Mr Davis. - All right? - Thank you very much. So you'll be... What will you be? You won't be my father. You'll be my uncle, won't you, or something? All right. Bye-bye, anyway. - Bye-bye. Adio. - Adio. Adio. Bye. Thank you very much. Bye-bye, Mr Davis. (They murmur) (Woman murmurs) OK, thank you. (Speaks Italian) Bye-bye. Thank you. (Mr Davis) Yeah, are you the CIO? I have... My name is Mr Davis, Reuben Davis. And I have some very distressed people in my office at the moment. It appears that they have their little sister... She came here last night. Only a child of 14. And you've locked her up. I'd like to know what it's all about. Well, I've made the arrangements today. I'm making arrangements now, and I'm getting her into the Cambridge School of English. Yes. Yes, I will, but I don't want this child detained. She's only a baby. You can't lock up young kids of 14. I can't dictate to you? No, I'm not dictating to you. It's... But it's inhumane, what you're doing. A young child of 14 years of age came alone and you just lock her up. Surely, you have the power to release her in the custody of her sister? And please can we see her, Mr Davis? (Mr Davis) Well, why don't you wish to exercise it? Where is she at the moment? In Harmondsworth Detention... A young girl on her own? With all those different people in here in Harmondsworth? What's that? For people coming on holidays? Is that what it's for? And that's where she... You sound... you... Excuse me if I may say so, are you a Pakistani immigration officer? You sound as if you've got a foreign accent. I can't hear you very well. Can't understand you. I'm not being abusive at all. I know you've got Mr Chirin Gheling there as an immigration officer. And Mr Gomez. Yes, because it does matter, because English people won't take a young girl of 14 and lock her up, and that's why I'm asking you. And you are the people... You are the people that turn round to Amin and tell Amin what a bastard he is for letting... not letting British... You're the type of people... I think I'll have to talk to the Chief Immigration Officer. We'll get her out. We will get her out. All right, now, we phone the Home Office. I'm gonna phone the Home Office now and I'll speak to the guy at the Home Office. - Morte. - (Woman) 'Maude?' Yes, please. Alex Lyon's secretary. 'Oh, Mr Moore.' Could you please get this child released? (Man) 'I'll have to ask for more details, Mr Davis. 'Does she come from Cyprus?' She's from Cyprus, and she's in the Turkish sector of Cyprus... 'Yeah?' ...and she came... Her sister's here with me at the moment. 'Yeah. 'I'll certainly make enquiries about this girl's situation 'because of her age. 'But other than that I cannot say.' - I've never met you. - 'Yeah.' I'll say this about your governor. He's a decent feller and he's a nice chap. I wouldn't like to change my opinion about him. I want to keep the same opinion. 'Yes, so, if you can assure the girl's sister 'that we are considering the case urgently on her behalf.' Yeah, I wouldn't like her to spend another night in that place. 'No, of course not. We are considering it now.' Good. I won't phone you no more. Have a nice weekend and I won't bother you anymore. And thank you. I'm grateful to you. - 'My pleasure. Bye.' - Bye-bye. Well, OK. They're going to act. Today. And they are looking into the matter right away. I wouldn't be surprised if she'll be out tonight. I hope so. (Tannoy announcement) Excuse me. They can take her, they can undress her, and examine her private parts, under the law, for... they call it... they can photograph her, measure her... ...and they can examine her private parts for the purposes of identification. - Did you know that? - No, I didn't. Well, this is the law. This is disgusting. Yeah, well, that's what I call it, disgusting, but they can do. And Securicor employees may also be authorised by the Home Secretary to do these things. They can also do it. So, any man there, if he wants to examine her, and he's a Securicor guard, he can under the law take this young girl undress her, strip her, and examine her private parts if he wants to. Did any of this happen to her? (Speaks foreign language) - No. - No. She wasn't? Well, thank God for that. How long you been working here? Half past three. Half past... Pardon? Half past three. Half past three. No, how many years have you been here working? Half past three years. You mean three and a half years? Yeah. And when you came here, then what happened? I understand now that the police came and picked you up. Yeah. And what did they do to you? They arrested both of them here? Your wife was working here as well? Yeah. She is deported. - Pardon? - She is deported. They deported the wife? And what about you? They told you you can have an appeal? - Yeah. - And you have an appeal now. It took me a year to break him in to use this certain machine. You understand? One whole year. We spent a lot of time with him, overtime and Saturdays to break him in to work this machine. - He's a nice type of chap, too. - Gentleman. (Mr Davis) How did I get into this business? Well, I used to be a personnel director for a large export group... in the clothing industry, I've always been interested in the clothing industry. Every factory would be about... The machines would be 40 per cent idle in every factory because of the shortage of workers. So, I went abroad and I managed to contact 100 girls who had come to this country for two years on a contract earning about 35, 40 pound a week. I came back to this country, I went to the Department of Employment and I asked them for work permits for the applicants. The Department of Employment said, "Sorry, Mr Davis, "we can't give you work permits, "because there are half a million people unemployed." I said, "Goody-goody, "if there's a half a million people unemployed, "that's what we want. "Give us 1,000 machinists, "British workers first, "and we will employ them immediately. "They'll all be working within 24 hours." They said, "I'm sorry, Mr Davis, "but there are no machinists unemployed." So, I said to them, "Well, can I have work permits for these people coming in?" They said, "No, Mr Davis, "you can't have work permits for these people, "because there's a half a million people unemployed." They said, "Mr Davis, would you mind trainees?" I said, "Yes, I don't mind taking Jack the Ripper's sister, "as long as she can use a machine." So they sent me along to the trainees' department to see if I could get some trainees and I had a letter from the trainees' department saying, "I'm sorry, Mr Davis, "young girls today don't want to go into the clothing industry. "They want to work in shops. "They would like to work in stores "or they would like to work in offices." I came back again with this letter to the Department of Employment and they said to me, "Mr Davis, if we give you the work permits, "the unions will go mad." So, I went along to the union and the union... Here's a letter here from the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers, and they said, no, Mr Davis, we will support the application because if you have no machinists, then you don't need finishers, and you don't need designers, because they're the mainstay, machinists are the mainstay of the business, and they gave me a letter supporting the application. The Department of Employment then said to me, yes, Mr Davis, don't worry, we can get these workers for you. We've got thousands of Ugandan Asians coming into the country and you're sure to get as many machinists as you can get. Subsequently, I went down to four of the camps, where these girls and all these Ugandan Asians were, to see if I could recruit labour, and I managed to find one girl only out of the whole issue. One girl said she would come and work for me if I bought her a house. So I said, "Listen, my darling, you buy me a house "and I'll come and work for you." I came back, I went along to the Department of Employment and I said, "Department of Employment, what shall I do?" And they gave me a wonderful answer. They said to me, "Mr Davis, "the best thing to do is don't take export orders." Now, this man must have been a genius, because I understand that he's been promoted since then. Are you married? No. Are you engaged to be married? Yeah. And why don't you get married if you're engaged to be married? And if you get married you'll be able to stay here under the new ruling by the Home Secretary. Yeah. That's a good idea. It's a good... Well, if you're engaged to the girl... - Yeah. - ...you're gonna marry her. You don't get engaged unless you marry her. Exactly. Or do you get engaged... Is this a habit with you? - Always to get engaged? - No. And they teach you to speak English in school? Yes, I have been to school in evening classes. They taught you to say God save the King? Yes, sure, I have got. Used to sing it in school? Empire days? Used to have the British flag and wave it about? - The Union Jack? - That's right. Mr Lyon gave me some very good news today. Mr Lyon told me that he's going to stop me and put me out of business, and I can't carry on my business anymore, because I charge people for what I do. So, I said, "Well, under the laws, "you're empowered to give me a grant. "So, if you give me the grant, I won't charge people." He's gonna instruct them up there not to answer my letters, not to talk to me, not to discuss anything with me. (Woman) Yes. So, what do you think that'll mean for your business? Nothing at all. Not a thing. I said you can't stop me representing people if I go up to the adjudicators' court. He said, "The adjudicator might not want to listen to you." I said... "You're telling me," I said, "now... "...you're telling me that the adjudicator... "you have no control over the adjudicator, "and now you say the adjudicators won't listen to me? "Supposed to be independent, "and you're telling me they won't listen to me? "So, that's your independence?" I said, "According to the immigration law, "the adjudicator must listen to anybody, any appellant "or any appellant's representative "they wish to appoint. "That's the law." "Yes, but they may not want to listen to you." I said, "Come on." I said, "You know it's not independent, "because next time I go up there, "I'm gonna wear my pith helmet up there. "You know these colonial magistrates." I told him that. - (Woman) What did he say? - Oh, he smiled. He knows the score. He's not a fool. He knows what it's all about. He knows I'm absolutely right. He knows. Probably that's what he got the needle about. If he was so concerned that we're charging these immigrants money, why doesn't he give them free legal advice? The same as anybody can get in the court. It's easy for him to do that, to say they can get legal advice, legal aid. Won't give them legal aid. So, what do they have to do? It's all down to one thing. They must go to where he wants them to go and that is the UKIAS, that's all there is to it. (Woman) You reckon there's a connection between UKIAS... Course it is. Any idiot can see that. UKIAS get a 125,000 grant. People don't want to go to the UKIAS. They can go to anyone they want. They choose to come to me because they think I can do a job much better. (Lewin) Is that what you told him? Well, I said give me a grant. Well, no, he said UKIAS. I said it's like me suing you and sending you to my solicitor to help you. (Man speaks in foreign language) (Woman speaks quietly) Yeah, I suppose it is. (Typing) We will write a letter on her behalf to the Home Office... Yes. ...and say that for family reasons she would like to stay here for a year more, and as I said to her a year ago that we are an independent body. We are not controlled in our direction of the work as to how we do. We are entirely independent on that. Though we are a government-funded body but we don't take directions from the Home Office or from anybody from the Home Office how we should do with our clients. What advice we give you, what advice, the answer is entirely between us and the clients. We absolutely were under no directions from the Home Office as far as how our job's concerned. Is that clear? Because some people have got some doubt that, oh, because we are a government-funded body, we are under their thumb. It is not so. We are not under their thumb as far as our duties are concerned. - OK? - Yes. Now, you have come well and truly freely to us... Yes. ...and our service is free of charge, we do not charge you a penny. And because we don't charge you a penny, it doesn't mean it's a cheap service. It's a specialised service by itself. No, this is our speciality. The immigration is our speciality. You've seen your sister, have you? (Man) Yes, I just left her. Well, I've telephoned Immigration to find out what the situation is as far as they see it. Um... it appears that the main problem is that she applied for an entry certificate last year and was refused. Um... she was refused because they didn't consider she had especial incentive to go back to Guyana, if she came here. Um... now they say that they interviewed her all yesterday, um... and that she wasn't... well, didn't really give them all the true details, and I think they told you this as well, didn't they? (Man) Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yes. I think she must be a bit confused. Do you think she is a bit confused? Well, I was confused when I was there because, you know, I don't think it's... It's a catch, you know what I mean? They're pumping things in your head and they're trying to catch you, you know what I mean? It's a test, more or less, you know? And they are trying to tempt you to do this, and before you know what you said, they confuse you with something else. It's, you know, it's... I don't know. It's more or less they are putting things in your mouth and they want... they're hoping that you will say those things. Mm. What do you think her incentive is to go back to Guyana? You see, once she comes here as a visitor, she is quite entitled to make an application to stay here for studies or for permanent settlement or for anything else. So as far as you're concerned... But this is what they want to avoid her doing, we think. So how do you avoid that? You're guilty before you prove yourself. No. Yes, are, because they say that, you know, she want to come here to settle. (Woman) Well, this is what they suspect. Yeah, this is what they suspect, right? It's not a suspicion anymore because it's a fact now, isn't it? (Woman) It's not a fact, no. They suspect. Well, it's a fact because they're sending her back, aren't they? It's true to say that Immigration can refuse people here permission to enter the country as a visitor without definite proof that they're not genuine visitors. So, you're guilty before you're innocent? I know what the British Constitution says. I went to school in my childhood days and that's one of the fundamental rights. You're innocent until you're proven guilty. You know what I mean? All this detention thing they have there. I'd like them to go and spend some time there themselves, Just live there for a day or so, and see how they like it. Yes, I know it's not very pleasant. Um... I've been living over here long enough. I know a lot of things and you know I'm not stupid. But you behave decently and they try to make you stupid. Well, the only thing we can do now, as she has been refused, um... if you want to, she can appeal against this decision. Um... but only after she's been sent back. What, put her though all this again? No. I think they... (Woman) If I can just explain what the appeal procedure is. She will have to lodge the appeal within 28 days of her return. The appeal will... (Man) And they're gonna pay for all the passage and all that, I suppose? Well, the airline that brought her here has to take her back, yes. She doesn't pay for that. No, but if you appeal and you do win, they have to pay for the passage and everything else, won't they? Or you have to spend all the money all over again? - And that's justice? - (Woman) It may well be, yes. You could take that up with the Home Office. I don't know. No, I could take it up for what they've done to her since yesterday. I call it torture. Mm. Well, what are you going to do? What do you want to do? I can only give you advice. So ask me questions, and I'll help you if I can. I just want to go home and sleep. Um... and think it over so you want to decide... No, go to sleep. I'm so tired. Mm, and what about the appeal from abroad? Do you want go through with that or not? Or haven't you decided? I don't think... I mean, you come over here to visit, and all this argy-bargy just to visit. Is it worth it, visiting a country under these circumstances? I don't think it is. Well, that's for you to decide. No, you see, the visit is over. I mean, that's her visit. Mm. Well, I'm trying to find out whether Miss Rama... Rama Khan... - (Man) Shanti Devi. - Shanti Devi Rama Khan. She's a girl from Guyana who came here from Toronto yesterday. I'm trying to find out whether she's gone yet or not. Well, I think she's supposed to go at 2:30. I'm not quite sure really. To Toronto. Mm. (Man) I don't mind if they let her stay for a day. That'd be all right. But just to come and go like this, it's probably like people like animals in the zoo, you know, which are bad and you send them back. You know, that's the only way you can think of it. You're not human beings anymore. You're just animals. No... you know, it makes me think of Nazism and all that sort of thing. (Phone ringing) (Man) 'Hello?' Hello. Can I speak to you about a client that you have detained down in the Immigration there? - 'Who's that speaking, please?' - Mr Davis. - 'Mr Reuben Davis?' - Yes, it is Mr Reuben Davis. 'And what's the name of your client, Mr Davis?' Mr Sharif Ali. 'Well, I'm afraid that I have instructions 'from the Home Office 'to have no further dealings with you, Mr Davis, and...' - Can you tell me... - '...to advise you that, er... 'should you wish your client to be represented 'then you should advise him to either represent himself 'or to seek some further representative.' Would you advise me, then, as the Home Office advised you, to tell me where these people should go for representation? 'No, they have not, but, as I've been advised 'to have no further dealings with you and...' Is that what the Home Office told you, that you mustn't have any further dealings with me? 'Goodbye, Mr Davis.' Can you please tell me why? (Click) Just cut me off. Can't... can't deal with me anymore. You see, the Home Office, I explained to you, they want to nationalise my business. They don't want me to act on your behalf because I fight too strongly for my clients. So there's not much I can do. So I advise you now to go down to the... Dover, go to Dover now, and speak to the Chief Immigration Officer, tell him that your brother's not illegally in this country, he's not, he has been here legally with the consent of the Home Office, to remain in the country until the appeal is heard. Anyway, he's gone back. He's gone back. Did you explain to him about the appeal? Yes, I did. They don't want to know anything. He looked so miserable. He was hardly talking to us. (Man) Crying. Crying all the time, coming from his eyes. (Ben Lewin) What about the immigration officer? What was his mood? What was his attitude? He was very joyful. He was very joyful because he's sending him back. And he was the chief immigration officer himself. - (Ben Lewin) Which one? - The one with the beard. He is the one who stamped his passport to go back and he called a young chap inside to interview us, and he was sitting next to him. But mostly questions he was asking. (Ben Lewin) What was his attitude to you? Well... To me? (Ben Lewin) Yeah. He look all right, but to him, they ask him who organise this press to come here and he told them that you organise it. (Ben Lewin) That I organised it? Yeah, but I think they were a bit annoyed to see the press down here. They didn't like it. They didn't like it when they see the press. They close all the windows. They... they put the lights inside. All the windows were open when we get in and when we sit down they put curtains... (Woman) Inside the police station? Yeah. (Ben Lewin) What's your experience been like here? Experience? What sort of experience? Oh! My goodness! This is experience? Oh! Experience is horrible. Everybody's got the same story, all back along behind there. How are you treated? Obviously when I'm treated as a prisoner over here, you can make a zebra out of me, like right now you are seeing. I'm not allowed to step out of this place, as if I'm a criminal. I've not committed any crime. Everybody is depressed. You can see people crying around here. (Ben Lewin) Hmm? (Man) You can see people crying around here. (Ben Lewin) Do people here understand why they're in here? Well, most of them, if they've not understood, they're made to understand, do you see? We had one person in the morning today. Two of them, rather. They were going to United States of America, coming from Saudi Arabia. They had a transit halt of about 18 hours over here and they had hotel booking and everything. These people never allowed them to go the hotel. They said this was the hotel and when those poor chaps landed over here, they were shocked. They were just shocked, you see. They felt they were taking them to a hotel. They didn't know that they were putting them to a detention camp. (Ben Lewin) Before this, did you regard yourself as having any British sympathy, British connections? I did always feel that I was possessing a British passport and that was something. Till such time I have realised that possessing a British passport, I think it's a discredit. Mind you, I'm not going to possess it anymore. When I go home, I will think it over, whether I should possess it or just ask for some other nationality of some other country, not this one. He holds a British passport. And these men, they were kicked out of Burma, you know about Burma, you see, for about ten years. For ten good years of his life, he has slogged. He has slogged. Just because he's a national of this place, obviously he's not going to be entitled to work in any other country other than this. So, wherever for these ten years he has worked here he has worked illegally, do you see? All this... all these years. And poor chap, he did not have money to come over here all these years. So now he has borrowed money from his friends, and landed over here. (Man murmurs) Same place, detention room. (Ben Lewin) What's the average length of stay here? What seems to be the time that people have to... The average length? I won't tell you average length because most of the people around over here have stayed more than a week over here. In fact for myself I have 15 days. This gentleman must be about 13 days. And there are people who have stayed for two months and one month. (Ben Lewin) Mm. This gentleman over here, he had, I think, a pure British passport before about 1939. 39, yeah. In the year '39. He has been setting off for United Kingdom. Setting off for the United Kingdom by bus. Past 40 years. (Ben Lewin) How long has he been here? (Man) He's been here for about two months now. - (Ben Lewin) For how long? - For two months, I think. (Ben Lewin) What's happening with his case? Well, God alone knows what's happening with his case. So far he has not been asked to come to the Immigration. Nobody has informed him anything about it. This man wanted to come from Karachi to this place and settle over here. He says he has a right to settle because he has got a pure British passport. Mr Lewin, if you'd like to come and have a word with me, please. (Ben Lewin) I think I'll have a word with you here. Look, I'm not required to come and have a word with you. I'll have a word with you here, if you like, Mr Mitchell. You're not prepared to come and have a word with me, then? We can talk here. Oh, I see. Well, tell me, have you got permission from the Home Office PRO for this? I spoke on Wednesday to Alex Lyon, the Minister of Immigration and he has no objection himself to my filming any matters involving immigration control. I'll give you his home telephone number. No, no. You say you did this on, what, Wednesday of this week? I spoke to Alex Lyon on Wednesday of this week. He has no objection to my filming anything involving immigration control. But did this include the people in the detention accommodation? The only proviso was, that if officials working in the Immigration service didn't wish to be included in the film, then I should respect their wishes, and I've agreed to do that. So, you've not taken it up directly with the press relations officer? You've gone straight to Mr Lyon? (Ben Lewin) Yes. But the press relations officer is acquainted with me. All right. Well, if you say you've cleared it... (Ben Lewin) I haven't asked... I haven't on this occasion asked the Home Office for any facility, to provide me with any facility. But as a personal discussion between myself and Mr Lyon, - he has nothing to hide. - No, very well. (Ben Lewin) I don't know if your opinion differs. Well, if you say that you've done that, there's nothing much more I can do. All right, thank you, Mr Lewin. But if you talk to the officer like this, he believes in you, but when I tell him that I am right, he doesn't believe in me. When I tell him that I have come as a visitor, he says no. When I tell him I've got business over there, he says no. When I tell him that my wife is pregnant and I'm expected to reach home earlier, they say no. When you say that you have talked to somebody, he just takes it for granted that you have talked. Why doesn't he phone after the minister concerned and ask whether you have taken permission or not? But just merely, I suppose, because you are white, and I'm brown, he takes you for granted and with me, no. (Vehicle approaches) (Ben Lewin) I think we'd best be off. Well, we can see some new faces coming over here. - They're the latest. - (Ben Lewin) Yes. (First man) The latest criminals, you see. God knows what is their crime. Because over here people come with visas and even they are refused. (Lewin) Have you been assisted at all by any outside agency? (First man) Well, my brother approached the UKIAS and they said they are going to take care of it, and UKIAS, I tell you, that's a body which just doesn't get into my head, you see? I've been here for bloody 15 days. Nobody has come to see me so far. Nobody. One person did come, day before yesterday. But that is when I phone him up to find out as to what's the fate of my case. The man says it's with the Home Office and he doesn't know the fate of it. I was working one day late in the office and then I had a telephone call from Benjani and he said that I should inform the... Immigration that he would like to go back if he's not let in. So, I found him... he was in a bit of a mood, so I decided that I go and see him personally. So I visited him in the detention centre and I gave him a bit of advice. And advice was that... be patient. I wanna stick this up the Immigration. Of course. And that is my main... my main idea. Yeah. And that's why I want to do this, because I think myself that it's wrong what they are doing to people. It is wrong. They are making people suffer for nothing and they're bloody hypocrites and therefore... and that is the main reason why I wanna have a go at the Immigration. Yes. Well, let 'em change their bloody laws. They give people passports, British passports, when they need them, when they wanna milk 'em, and after they can't milk 'em anymore, the passports, they might as well put it down the toilet. Now... I came to see you because I don't have many contacts in Pakistan and India, and I wanted to arrange, in view of the new ruling, by Lord Denning, that people don't... or wives of patrioles don't have to... ...go to the British High Commission in Delhi or Pakistan, Karachi, to get the entry certificates. It could be given from this country... ...and therefore people don't have to wait 21 months before they can join their husbands and before fathers can see their children. So, I've come to you to see if we can sort of arrange whereby we can fetch over 100, 200 or 300 wives... ...of patrioles into this country, without having to wait in long queues and being messed about for 21 months and maybe longer. Now, do you have such contacts there? Yes, yes, we have. Do you think.... Are you interested in doing this? Yes. It says that, um... golden years for the Pakistani in Britain. (Man) Hello? You will be delighted to hear that that you could bring your children, your wife from Pakistan and you don't have to wait so long. You need a passport. Marriage certificate. And a birth certificate. We are bringing a flight from Pakistan to carry 300 families, so if you like to be one of the passengers, please contact us. And especially, you see, they don't have to worry about any legal aspects and they don't have to be scared that they'll be sent back. People from India, Bangladesh, has got no fear. They could come, jumping up to Britain, without any problem. But the people from Pakistan, they've got a bit of problem, which I'm taking care of. You know, they won't have any problem. They will come. After this high court judgement, I feel, that if we arrange a flight, and people come here, at the airport, the immigration officers will have to give them the OK to enter the country as legal immigrants to join their husbands. What airline will accept them? Of course, they're all immigrants, all of them. If you like... - Yeah. - Yes. We are bringing them by Russian Airlines. No, let them... No, we'll even bring them by Air India. No, no. British Airways. We'll bring them by British Airways and Air India. Look, we've got a very small country over here, very small, compared to, you know, the world, - a tiny little country. - Yeah. Why overpopulate it? Why make it worse for everybody that's here? No, it's not overcrowded. Listen, why did they come in the first place? You tell me, why did they come here in the first place? Why did they come? Why did somebody allow them to come here? Because they did think they'd have a better life over here. No, why did somebody allow them here? - Because they... - They needed 'em. - Yeah, they needed them, right? - They needed them then. Yeah, but they don't need 'em now. You can't say it like that, they don't need them now. They just keep the manpower and they don't... they don't want their wives and children. Why is that? I know what we're gonna do. We are going to bring three loads of aeroplanes, three loads, and we'll see what the Home Office does. We are going to bring three loads of aeroplanes full up with wives and children, which have been stranded in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, right into Heathrow Airport, Gatwick Airport, Stansted and Luton Airport. - Is that all? - No, maybe we'll bring more. It's a matter of opening a floodgate. If we open this, we open the floodgate to everybody, to the world. The British islands are swamped. They can't take any more people! My wife and my children have to stay with me. Yes, your wife and children... But if they're allowed to come here, and they're not allowed. That's what we're going to request, the British Government. To be more human. They're not. At least some of their officers. They don't want to consider us on equal par. What they want, to give the rights to you as white man. We have the same rights. Either they shouldn't admit us in this country. If they have... if they have... we are working very honourably, we are living very, very, very honestly, hard-working. We work... It is eight o'clock and I'm still working. I earn my living and I earn the right to bring my family to enjoy the benefits of my work and they can't do that in India or Pakistan or Bangladesh. They have to be here so that my children can be here to enjoy all the benefits, which by my hard work I deserve in this country. I deserve as much as you. First of all, my criticism is that the adventure is ill-timed in the sense that the divisional court is considering that matter. It might prejudice their decision. Secondly, that the way it has been propagated, that they don't need an entry certificate, that it has already been decided by court. I'm just saying they don't need the law. That's my view as a lawyer. But when you tell the people the law has already decided, now that is a mischief. It's the wrong way to put it. The way it has been advertised in the court of appeal has now said Pakistanis don't need entry certificate, the court of appeal has not said. So one thing was that is a wrong way to inform people. And secondly, I come back with the same thing. That people ought to know what risk they are taking. If they are taking, knowingly, they are taking risk, if they know when they are in the air, before they land at the airport, that all may not be lovely and green, they might have to stay in detention and are ready to fight for their rights, then I'm all for it. Mr Dooley, how about a nice cup of coffee and we sit down and we have a little talk. What about Coca-Cola? Better still. Cheers, man. Best of luck. (Speaking Urdu) I made a terrible mistake. My brother-in-law came from Finland and I took him down Hatton Garden and I just bought him a watch. (Mr Dooley) You are very angry? (Mr Davis) No, I didn't know he sold watches. Let my advertisement go through first. Yes. It will take another... about a week. You know, this advertisement may come this Saturday. Yes. And it reads... should I show... should I read, would you say? Please. In Urdu or in English or what? Well, I don't understand Urdu. You'll have to tell me in English what it means. Yeah, it's written, how many beds you've got in your house. In your home. Um... how many trees are in the lawn. And what is the colour of your dog. And how many animals you got in the house. (Mr Davis) What do they want to know that for? Yeah, but this is what these people are asked in Pakistan. So these are the questions which are asked by the entry... the entry visa officer in British High Commission in Pakistan. (Mr Davis) How many trees they got in the house? - What, in Pakistan or here? - In Pakistan. And if they don't know, they don't think that they are the right people. If they don't answer the right question they say no, we don't give you visa. Well, I've been living in a house 17 years. I don't know how many trees I've got in my house. So therefore I can't go anywhere. This is how they prolong it. This is how they prolong the... the dates. They give them... keep giving them dates until somebody pay them the money. And they ask them the colour of the... Yeah, the colour of the dog. The colour of the dog. Do they ask how many times the dog has a piss each day? Yeah, of course they do. They ask them. And if they can't answer them, they don't give them any entry permit. No, why Home Office should write a letter to me? Why? They're very worried. They're worried. If the law is all right, why should they write to me? Who wrote it? Yeah. God Almighty. Hello? That's right, yes. Mr who? Oh, yes, he's here, yes. One second, please, yes. For you. Hullo. I've been informed that you must have no dealings with me. Is that... is that what you're saying? Yes, Mr Dooley has been over to my office to see me to discuss this plane we're bringing in tomorrow. Can I help him with it? Yes, well, we've got... no, we've got a letter from you. It says that, er... the Minister of State, Mr Lyon, has asked me to express to you his concern about this advertisement and to endorse the observations of Mr Sibghat Kadri. Who's Mr Sibg... I know Mr Kadi. Kadri. I know him well, and he's only a young barrister. I mean, the barristers that Mr Dooley has been to are very senior members of the bar. I mean they're real pukka barristers and, er, the advice he's got from them is OK. Bring them in. Just like that? Yes, well, when... Right. Well, then, Justice Denning, Lord Justice Denning, if he will issue... (Clears throat) ...corpus habeus, mandamus papers... I don't see how you can return them. It'd be contempt of court. (Clears throat) Mr Wicks. But, Mr Wicks, in all fairness, I told Mr Dooley to cancel it. I've tried to tell him to cancel it. Because I told him that it's silly. He should hire a ship, a boat. A great big boat. Well, if there's nothing further you can add, then we'll have to see and wait to... wait and see what happens. Ah, bye-bye. He's gone mad. Nothing further I can add, these people will be returned and... Yeah. So the next meeting will be in a hall? Yeah. Would you arrange for a hall, or what? Well, I had to tell him that we've got a ship coming over. Get them all worried. And there's a plane coming over tomorrow. And you can bet your life that down at the airport there'll be about 600 immigration officers. So we'll give the poor immigrants a chance in Dover to get in. Cos there'll be no immigration officers in Dover. They're gonna transfer them all to Heathrow. Yeah. With all the Securicor people. Yeah. Which is good because I've got some people coming in Dover so I don't want to get them aggravation. So they'll be able to come in. Let's divert 'em, shall we? Yeah. We'll tell 'em they're coming to Heathrow. We'll get the plane to land at Gatwick and we'll have those immigration officers running up and down. They'll be giddy. They won't know where they're running. OK, then, Mr Dooley. OK, then. Fine. Thanks a lot. And I'll see you. Yes. Thank you for calling and that's lovely. Yeah, yeah. I'll have to put in a word first, you see. No, we'll fight. You ready to fight? Then we'll fight. Yeah, yes. Yes. (Speaks Urdu) I'm not asking any money or anything. (Mr Davis) And therefore you should... Asking people to come forward. And let's do together. (Mr Davis) Yes, but nobody's come forward, you see? You should form yourself into a group. Those long waiting queues, they should be eliminated. Yes, that's it. They must make these arrangements in such a way... Yeah, well, what the public is going to do for this? So, what we people are going to do for this? Are we doing anything? Are we writing to the Home Office? We have to agitate here to the Home Office. And if you can bring numbers, 200, 300, they won't send a planeload of people back. We can have 'em out on bail. We can have them out on bail to be with you, and I think you'll win the case. Actually, they cannot withstand the impact which will be generated by the numbers. (Mr Davis) You've got people fighting for you. There should be some reason why. Sorry about this, you see, and that's it. I thought that you people really need help. But you don't need help, do you? No, they don't need help. I mean, Pakistanis don't need help. What help do you need? They think everybody on fast now. They're too tired to come. Yeah, that's a possibility, you know. Tomorrow is a festival, you see. Today's a fast. What, tomorrow's Ramadan? Yes, end of Ramadan tomorrow, yes. The end of Ramadan? It's a feast day, you know, it's a holiday. All right, OK. We're fasting for Ramadan. All right, we'll go along then. We'll speak to them tomorrow. - Yes. - It's a good idea. That's what we should have done in the first place. Gone to the mosques. In the first place. Yeah, you're right. Well, the people here in this country, who are living here, you see, they are living scattered all over and they're not organised. That has been the main, you see, difficulty, that, as you have witnessed inside, that there has not been a good gathering over here. I mean, some of us... for instance, myself, I'm not faced with any difficulty so far as this problem is concerned. But I'm interested in the problem itself and its solution, because the solution, it is so, so difficult for the Pakistanis that so far we haven't seen anything, you see, coming out. People whose wives are waiting to join them, they are giving dates. Their applications to be examined in Islamabad in 1977. You see? For instance, this gentleman, his daughter, you see, has applied to come to her father, and she has applied in Islamabad, and she has been given a date for her application to be examined and for her to be interviewed in July '77. When did she apply? When did she apply? About six month ago. She applied six months ago. And she was already in this country over four and a half years, and she went back in 1969. What kind of business are you doing here? (Ben Lewin) I'm making a film about it, about these problems. Well, how do you like this jacket? - (Ben Lewin) How do I like it? - Yes. (Ben Lewin) I've had it for ten years. - Ten years? - Yes. It's time you had a new one now. - You think so? - Yes. I'm very attached to this one. Oh, it's very nice, but we are dealing in leather jackets. (Ben Lewin) Oh, yeah? We are dealing in leather jackets, and actually these are very expensive garments. But we'll do a deal, cheap for you, since you are interested in our problems. (Ben Lewin) Mm. You'll also take interest in mine? Yes. Yes. (Ben Lewin) Well, I've never really regarded this jacket as one of my problems. Thanet House. And we go in there. - (Woman coughs) - All right. Would you like to go in the waiting room? We're gonna have a colonial hearing today. Of course. In there. Now, I've forgot my native boy. He's coming along with a palm leaf in a minute and he's wearing a loincloth. Is he? So, please show him the way to the waiting room. I will. Right, and my two bearers will come along in a minute. - Is that OK? - (Laughing) Yes, sir. Are you calling any more witnesses? Er... yes. The names were all taken, weren't they? The coach will be along in about one hour. (They laugh) You'd had two witnesses, hadn't you? Yes. And there's one more to go. Yes, we have this gentleman to go. Oh, fine. Any more? The coach. I don't know what time the coach will be down. Are you joking? No, they've just come off... They've just come off. The plane has just landed. With the 72 Pakistanis. (Woman laughs) They'll be along soon. They're coming straight along. Right. We're in the big tribunal room. Are we? That's fine. I never know whether he's joking or not. - It's hot in Africa. - I was gonna say. It's goddamn hot in this midday sun. - Mr McCall will like that. - Tigers all around me. There we are. Have you already been a witness? Yeah. Oh, so you can sit anywhere you like. And do you want him... Shall I sit him there? You're gonna be straightaway... (Mr Davis) Isn't it a fact you refused these people because they were Cypriots? (Man) You're coming very close to attacking this witness's character. - (Mr Davis) Am I really? - (Man) Yes. (Mr Davis) Do you know a Chirin Gheling? (Man) Well, do you know a Mr Chirin Gheling? (Man 2) Yes, he's the Chief Immigration Officer mentioned in the last paragraph here. (Mr Davis) Very well. Did you know what... did you know that Mr Chirin Gheling told me that he doesn't like Cypriots, they're all liars? (Mr McCall) Mr... Don't answer that question. It's completely irrelevant. (Mr Davis) I'm asking if he knows about it. (Mr McCall) Well, I'm telling him not to answer it. (Mr Davis) Why? (Mr McCall) Because it's completely irrelevant. (Mr Davis) Why? (Mr McCall) Because I say so. (Mr Davis) Why? (Mr McCall) Mr Davis, please get on with it. (Mr Davis) The reason for not letting this man in was that you thought he had too much money. £550. (Mr Gaughn) One of the reasons was that, er... his funds compared with his, um... salary initially, as the driver of a shunting locomotive and then subsequently after being a refugee, um... ...as the driver of a bulldozer, that, er... he seemed to have a lot of money compared with his earnings. (Mr Davis) Well, on the same flight there was a chap by the name of Chris Ndulu. He was sent back because he never had enough money. He only had £320. On himself. Now, what's enough money? I want to ascertain what is enough money. (Mr McCall) Don't answer that question. It's irrelevant. (Mr Davis) I think it's a lot of rubbish with you people! You look at a person's face and they turn round and say too much money, not enough money. You went to Greece for a holiday. How much money did you take with you? (Mr McCall) You needn't answer that question. (Mr Davis) Can't answer this question, you can't answer that question, you can't answer this... It's a perfect, legitimate, relevant question. (Mr McCaw) I don't agree with you. Don't answer it. (Mr Davis) Because I know people here, that come over here, to this country... Six weeks ago, an Arab come to this country and, sir, these people said, "Are you gonna work in this country?" Man says no. "If I gave you a chance to work in this country..." (Mr McCaw) Mm. "...would you work in this country?" The Arab said, "Look at my passport, you idiot. "I'm the son of the Sheik of Kuwait!" (Mr McCaw) Mr Davis, you really go too far. Now, get on with it, please. Otherwise I'll have to withdraw my recognition of you. (Mr Davis) Have to... (Mr McCall) I'll have to withdraw my recognition of you as an advocate in this, er... hearing. I've got the power so to do. (Mr Davis) Of course you have. (Mr McCaw) You've tried my patience... (Mr Davis) Of course you have your instructions as well from the Home Office. (Mr McCaw) Well, now, under those circumstances, you bring me to the brink of withdrawing. That is an infamous observation. (Mr Davis) There has been instruction... There's the evidence here. (Mr McCaw) I am a completely independent adjudicator, subject to no influence whatsoever. "From your conduct in this building, as reported to me, "by certain of my colleagues and staff, "I have for some time suspected "that you are not a fit and proper person "to be allowed to represent appellants before adjudicators." Took 'em two years to find out that I wasn't a... fit and proper person. It's up to me to decide with whom the Home Office will deal. And, er... where there's such a wide range of choice and there is this very... difficult question, about the control of a professional agent, um... I think that it's legitimate to make the ruling in the way that I did. (Lewin) As you would know from a Sunday Times comment, though, there is a certain Levantine philosophy that you get only what you pay for. Well, I think there is a feeling among some groups that unless the advice that is offered to them is paid for, it's unlikely to be very sound advice, but I think it's... it's an attitude that we ought to try to resist because I'm absolutely certain that the voluntary organisations, by and large, give excellent advice and that the kind of efforts that are made by members of parliament in particular on behalf of constituents, are... very effective, and therefore it is unnecessary in dealing with immigration to have paid agencies, in my view. (Ben Lewin) It is unnecessary? Mm. (Coughs) (Mr Lyon) On 7th August this year, I asked Mr Davis to see me. He explained that he considered immigration control to be a joke, and since the situation was what it was that he saw no reason why he should not base a business upon it. There is little evidence to show that at any stage that he's done anything that is illegal. But he is the kind of engaging conman who works in the East End markets, selling plates. (People laugh) With people who are immigrants he is a very dangerous man indeed to be let at large. (Man coughs) Therefore I decided that we were going to put a stop to his activities. He claims that his average price is about £50. On that basis, if my honourable friend is right in saying that he does 1,000 cases a year, his average income is £50,000. (Man) How are the public to sum you up, Mr Davis? Your sincerity might bring tears to their eyes. At the same time they might feel that no minister would call you an East End conman if he didn't have some facts to back him up. (Mr Davis) He's accused me of selling plates off of a barrow. There's nothing wrong in selling plates off of a barrow. Maybe Alex Lyon doesn't eat off plates. Maybe he eats off the floor. I don't know. Mr Lyon said in Parliament that you earn £50,000 a year. He said you told him that. Is that true? No, I told Alex Lyon that I earn £50,000 a week. Not a year. Because Alex Lyon, after five minutes, I realised I was talking to a nut. I... I run my organisation in this manner. People who can afford to pay subsidise the people who cannot afford to pay. And I say that I earn about seven and a half thousand. About seven and a half thousand to ten thousand a year. Alex Lyon can make any allegation he likes. When I was with Alex Lyon, and he told me he wants to be a priest, and I said, "Well, good luck to you, "I hope you'll be a bishop one day "and I can become your curate." He's gonna be a parish priest? God help us. He'll be worse than Oliver Cromwell, won't he? (Laughs) They've done some shocking things. I think when anyone takes a young girl of 13 years of age for no apparent reason and sticks 'em in a concentration camp... Because we've got concentration camps in this country. I took a lady out of the concentration camp last week. She was there six months pregnant and she has been there for seven weeks. She committed no crime. She came over here to join her husband. Yeah, it's a legal right for a woman to join her husband. He is a resident in this country. Right of abode in this country, in the United Kingdom. Why can't she join her husband? So, I brought my wife with me on 12th October and then they take her in a detention centre and they locked her up to seven weeks over there. - (Man) For how long? - Seven weeks. (Ben Lewin) Which detention centre? Er... Harmondsworth Detention Centre. So I have to go there. If I take her any food, they say the food is not allowed, and she was pregnant. She had to feed two people and they just giving her only rice dinnertime, and rice the night-time. (Ben Lewin) How much pregnant is she? What's her... (Man) She was over six months pregnant and sometimes she was quite hungry there. (Ben Lewin) Could she rest there? She have no rest at all. (Ben Lewin) Why not? Because they never, er... open her room so she can lie down somewhere. - (Ben Lewin) Her bedroom? - Bedroom, yes. (Ben Lewin) Why? What happened? They're locked from 9am, nine o'clock, and up till 9pm. They don't open the room till 9 or 10. (Ben Lewin) So, she couldn't lie down? No, she couldn't lie down. If she tries, sometimes she like to be, like relax, then she have to make two chairs together. (Ben Lewin) What did you do once... once they put her inside the detention centre? Well, I went to see someone at the detention centre. I went to see the UK Advisory Service. I said, what I should do? They said you can see your MP. But our MP was sitting in the House of Commons that time. I couldn't speak to my MP at all. Then I was fail everywhere then I went to see the solicitor. The solicitor said to me, "I will take £100." (Ben Lewin) How much? £100, before I spoke to anybody. I said OK. Go ahead, I gave him £100. (Ben Lewin) What did he do for the £100? Well, he just took it and put it in his pocket. (Ben Lewin) No, but what work did he do? What work he done, he done this one. He wrote a letter to MP and he wrote a letter to immigration officer and he sent a copy to the Home Office as well. So, then they says, OK, we will be... stop your wife. As long as his MP involve in this case. So it was seven weeks. I never heard after that what is going on, where I'm going. I got fed up, you know? Then I went to Mr Davis. Then he told me that... he phoned to everywhere. I mean in the journalists' papers there's... I know he done a lot of work for me. Then he put in the papers, Times, Guardian, It came to the Guardian. She was released same day when the article came in the paper. (Ben Lewin) Your wife doesn't speak English, does she? No, she cannot speak English at all. (Ben Lewin) What does she think of her whole experience? Was she surprised that... Well, she was thinking, that we were thinking everywhere, that is Britain is very great, very humanity over there, people is nice, and everything is going well, people love dogs and cats. But I've seen different in here. People love dogs and cats. They don't love people each and other. Huh? So, I'm pregnant woman. What I have suffer, I know, she says. But nobody else knows. I don't want you to think that I am for immigration. I'm against it. I don't believe we should have a million Pakistanis over here and five million Africans and, er... four and a half million West Indians. I'm against... But the British Government printed a lot of passports, and they didn't know what to do with these passports. They printed too many and they gave them out to all these people. Well, if you give these passports out, on the front page... I've got... No, I don't think I have mine with me. But in front of the passport it says, Her Majesty with the Privy Council... You know all this jazz? Let the holder have free, er... and in school they taught 'em to sing God Save The King and God Save The Queen. See, the public don't know. They don't know what's... You, Mr Lewin, you've been to Harmondsworth. You've seen cases of girls locked up. Now, I'll ask you. You've been asking me a lot of questions. I'll ask you a lot of... I'll ask you just one question. Were you surprised at the things you saw? (♪ Steel band plays "Rule Britannia")
