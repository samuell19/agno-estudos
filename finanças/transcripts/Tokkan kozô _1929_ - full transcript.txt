Do you want me to find a good hiding-place? You're making funny faces. Do you know how to make the snail face? Come with me. I'll take you to a funny place. I want to go back home! I want to go back! This kid seems very nice. Well done. I underestimated you. Is there anything you can do? Yes, I know how to make the hippopotamus. But first, you show me something. Again. You know, I can also imitate Matsunosuke. Flattery is useless. Get him out of here and abandon him. You must take a lot of money when you go out. Fed up of taking care of him, the kidnapper is going back where he got him. Show me the snail face again. You know, I'm a kidnapper. Liar! You don't look like a kidnapper. Uncle Kidnapper! He's the one who bought them for me. A Straightforward Boy THE END
