( Car honking ) ( Max ) In everyone's life, there are defining moments. Events after which everything is different, after which nothing is the same. I can smile now, and at times even laugh, when I think of what happened to me. But while I now have an understanding of the events of my story, I doubt I will ever have a full explanation. I am from a small town where I spent much of my life being told to get a real job. After putting myself through school, I spent a few years working 9:00 to 5:00, struggling to support my habit. And then one day, I got a break. This story begins just after the end of my first show in New York. ( Chattering ) Max, you did it. It's like a red-dot special in here. You sold almost every print. Look around. To Max. In all my years of owning this gallery, I have never seen a first show go so well. ( Max ) Yes. I want to thank you guys. This--this has been great. To Amy... Not much to say, except that I would do anything to get her to move here to New York with me. ( Music playing ) It's really great that I can call myself a photographer without feeling like an idiot. I--i guess I just, um, want to thank you guys for making a dream come true. Look, you should stick around. I--i'm gonna go to the hotel. Ok, but would you, um, would you promise me one thing ? That you'll reconsider ? Max, please. We knew this was going to happen. I don't want to talk about it again. Ok, I'll see you back at the hotel. Bye. ( Footsteps receding ) Max Martin ? Schuyler winn, Max Martin. She's with in file magazine, Max. They do, uh, events, people, art-world type stuff. She's here to make you famous. Ah, ok, Greg, give it a rest. It is so nice to meet you. I've been hearing great things. Hi. ( Schuyler ) Max, where did you shoot these ? ( Greg ) He's been hiding in Pennsylvania. No longer, I'm afraid. These are really incredible. Smile, Max. Life starts here. ( Max ) The show was a huge success. Things moved so fast in the following weeks and months. It was a confusing time that I thought was going pretty well until I realized i--i couldn't shoot a good photograph to save my life. ( Phone ringing ) It was a year after my opening, and I was in trouble. ( Schuyler ) Max, you have to get the rental car back. Everything had changed. Max, could you get that ? ( Max on answering machine ) Yeah, you've reached 549-7097. Leave a message, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thanks. ( Greg ) Max, you there ? Max, you screening ? That's great. Listen, tomorrow's a big day, pal, ok ? Bring the 10 shots in whatever form that you want. Just make sure you have 10. The decision on who makes the show will be made at 9:00 A.M., so do not be late, boychik, ok ? I can't wait to see these shots, man. You're a slam dunk, kid. Slam dunk. Oh, get this. Julie just sold a 10-shot set to Cher for $75,000. Do you believe ? Cher ! See you in the morning, pal. I didn't know it was tomorrow. Let's see what you got. Max ? ( Max ) As much as schuyler and I cared for each other, and we did, there are times when who you know can be as important as what you do or how you do it. It's unfortunate, but true. Schuyler knew everyone, and made it her job to know the next big thing. For a brief period, I was it.

( Horns honking ) ( Laughing ) I can't believe you just found these. Max, these are gonna change everything. Just hold on. How many times do we have to go over this ? I--i--i understand. Just let me think for a minute. You need these. Now listen to me, baby. This is what we've been dealt. Without these, you're finished. God ! These fucking horns are driving me crazy. Let them help you. Let them give you another chance. I can get in file to do a piece on you. You know, like, "he's back." Jesus, Max ! ( Answering machine ) You have one message. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Message one. This is exactly what you need to get back into the public eye. I know how it works. The 2nd show is the hardest. The 2nd movie, the 2nd novel. God, I know it's not what you want. But maybe it's fate. You get past this, and it's smooth sailing. I'm not just justifying it. You said it yourself. There's gotta be a reason. ( Horns honking continuously ) I'll respect whatever you do. Whatever you do. Fuck it ! ( Horns stop honking ) ( Sighing ) I mean, they're here. Right ? Right. Right. Let's celebrate. Champagne ? Oh, god ! The car. We're stuck. Why-- why don't we just return it tomorrow ? No. I said I'd stop by marcello's, anyway. So, I'll-- I'll take it. I want to see what marcello thinks of these. Be careful. It's late. ( Max ) I would show them to marcello. He had been a mentor, a teacher, a friend to me. If anyone would know I didn't shoot those photos, it would be him. He'd see through them. He'd stop me from making a mistake. Wow, man ! You haven't shot anything this honest all year. Thanks. Well, don't lose these. These are your ticket back. These are great. You know, I might as well be shooting weddings and bar mitzvahs. You're the best photographer I've ever seen. Yeah ? Well, guess what ? I don't have these. Yeah ? Well, that's because you spend all your time hiding in this fucking bathroom. All you got to do is say, "today, I think I'll have a-another show." And boom, there it is. ( People whooping ) Yeah, "boom, there it is." Hey, babe, you ok ? Hasn't talked to me in a month. How's the party going ? Come in here to get a little something for yourself, huh ? ( Sniffing ) Tough to compete. ( Marcello laughing ) Do you hear that ? That's a pro. ( People chattering ) ( Laughing ) You know, Max, whatever happens, don't lose your camera. Things fall out of focus, you have your camera, everything will be fine. Same goes for you. It's never too late to fix your mistakes. Yeah. Me, you know, I think my camera is buried under 100 beach towels at sag harbor. Or maybe my camera is in the wine cellar. Well, get it. Come on, man. You got something you can really be proud of here. Congratulations. Give me a hug. Give me a hug. ( Sighing ) All right ? Get out of here. ( Man chattering on t.V. ) ( Sniffing ) ( Man yelling ) ( Mugger ) Yeah, give it to me, come on. Oh, please, no ! Please, please, no ! I don't have anything. Please ! What did I do ? ( Man screaming ) ( Grunting ) Oh. ( Man groaning ) Hey ! Hey ! I called the cops. All right ? I called the cops. ( Groaning ) (Glass shattering ) ( Car alarm ringing ) You ok ? Yeah. You ? We've got to get a cop. Fuck ! They could've killed US. I didn't have any change. I'm bleeding. Hey ! ( Police radio chattering ) They were giants, really. They were, they were 2 giants. That's really all I can tell you. ( Police officer ) Any distinguishing marks ? I can't believe-- scars, anything like that ? We'll tow the car to the 38th street pound. If we find these guys, can we get you on your cell phone ? Yes. ( Groaning ) You did a good thing. You may have saved that guy's life. Right. Listen, I gotta get my stuff back. Without my stuff, I am dead. Beat it. Check garbage cans in the area. You may find some of your stuff there. The other shit is as good as gone. Right. Like I'm gonna check every fucking garbage can in the area. Christ ! ( Panting ) Huh ! ( Laughing ) I can do this. God ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! ( Panting ) I just wanted to thank you. Don't worry about it. Did--did a guy run by here ? No, really. Thank you. Did they get some of your stuff ? Yeah. I feel responsible. What did they get ? Photographs. What's the matter ? Wow ! I--i don't understand. How did it get up there ? I don't know. All right, um... Your photographs, how many you looking for ? 7 more. I got to go. Listen, I'm really good at looking for stuff. Let me give you a hand. No, thanks. It's--it's ok. No, you don't understand ! I can help ! I'm a writer ! What's the point ? Why would someone dump them in different places ? I know this great place. They got all kinds of stuff there. Maybe they'll have your photographs. ( Bicycle bell dinging ) Hey, man, it's a sign ! It's a sign. We got to go. We've got to go ! I don't think so. And you know, you really don't need to help. ( Clattering ) Jesus Christ ! Flying rats, that's all they are, pigeons. Squab. Hey, look, you need all the help you can get. I'm half bloodhound, half golden retriever. The perfect guide. ( Max ) Can we pick up the pace ? Ok, but I've got blisters. Did you say Cher was gonna buy these ? As in-- as in the singer ? No, no. No, you misunderstood, I mean, Cher is going to buy somebody else's set from the gallery. ( Cell phone ringing ) Hello ? ( Schuyler ) Where are you ? Schuyler ? We have some celebrating to do. Max, how ? It's like you were handed these things-- I know, I know. I fucked up. I don't know what to say to that.. Hello ? Hello ? ( Phone reception breaking up ) Hello. Hello ? Yes. Yeah, I'm here. Max, we are screwed without these. You think I don't know that ? Look, I'm going to get them. Hello. Schuyler ? Schuyler ? ( Marcello ) Well, don't lose these. These are your ticket back. ( Schuyler ) Max, now listen to me, baby. This is what we've been dealt. Without these, you're finished. What's up ? Come on ! No, no, please. Listen. I need your help. Ok. My name is Max. Romeo. ( People chattering ) "The streets were bursting. Alive. "Afire with life and energy. 'Could she be among the crowd ?' he asked himself." ( Max ) What ? Feel the abrusso. Just look around. That's an antique. It's a classic. How much ? Make me an offer. $10. Come on, that's an original. Give me $50. $15. Sold. Sold for $15. $15. There we go. That's... Hey ! Come back ! God. He's got one. Oh, this is great ! ( Romeo ) Got him, Max ! Apprehendo, Max ! I got him, Max ! Scissor-hold ! ( Man ) Get the fuck off me ! Relax ! You're free ! ( Max ) Why did you run ? Look at you two ! Why did you chase me ? Because of this. This is mine. That ? Yes. Yes. Where did you get this ? You took this picture ? Yeah, but it doesn't belong to him anymore, because he sold it to Cher. The singer-actor ? No, don't--don't worry about that. Where did you get this ? Violet gave it to me. She had a bunch. It could be a Christmas card. You send out Christmas cards ? So ? Well, I just... I thought that... Who's Violet ? Wait ! I know her. She's that drifter, homeless, spirit woman. Where is she ? Uh, you can ask downstairs, but you'd probably have better luck with a crystal ball. See ? I told you we should've kept that flyer. Here you go. Nice ! Don't. ( Music playing ) I bet you don't see this part of town too often. So, they know where Violet is ? No. No one does. They talk about her like she's some sort of... What ? What ? I've got to get some film for this thing. $15. See if it works. Look, I'm not going to a clairvoyant, ok ? So, let's just make that clear. But there is abrusso everywhere tonight. You gotta understand. It's in the air. "Abrusso" ? Yeah. You know, calm, understanding, faith that anything can happen, and that-- and that sometimes you just gotta go with it. Abrusso. It's Italian. ( Laughing ) Come on, man, you gotta believe in something. What else you gonna do ? I'm going to find Violet and get my pictures back. You lost 10 photographs and y-you expect to get them all back in one night. Getting 4 was a gesture of abrusso. To get all 10 would be... What do you got to lose ? Where is this place ? Your photographs... it's like you get something special that I just see as regular, you know, until I see your photographs. You write. It's the same thing. It's no big deal. N.b.d. What ? N.B.D: No big deal. You know, it is a big deal. I don't get special stuff ! I gotta be honest with you. I don't really write. "She was everything to him. Yet he was still to meet her." ( Romeo ) I don't even have a ribbon in my typewriter. ( Dinging ) You said you were a writer. I want to be a writer, but I'm having trouble, you know. I can't think of anything. I mean, nothing special, anyways. I mean, that's why I'm out here. You know, I figure I could find something. I'm an aspiring writer. You've probably got all the ideas you already need. Just sit down and write what you know. Oh, easy for you to say, you know. You're the artist, the photographer. I take photographs. You're walking better. Much better, thank you. We're closed. "And then she just appeared, as if from a dream." Look, I'm sorry, we're closed. Please, we're on a journey. What kind of journey ? We're looking for something: Lost photographs. Cher's involved. Come in. I'll wash up and be back with you in a minute. Yowza ! She is some looker, huh ? "She held a look of an entire culture in a single feature." ( Spitting ) What is that ? Shh ! "She smelled..." Why do you do that ? Talking to yourself ? Well, it's just writing stuff, you know. I'm just composing. Well, I'm sorry, but it makes you sound like a fucking lunatic. Quit it. ( Cell phone ringing ) Hello ? ( Greg ) Maxie, it's your agent, what's up ? Greg, hey ! Schuyler just called, freaking out, brother. What's going on ? Uh, n-nothing. Everything's cool. You all set for tomorrow, then ? Oh, yeah. I mean, you know schuy. You had me a little worried there, bingo. Hello ? Max ? Hello, Greg ? Max ? Yeah, um, what do you mean, "worried" ? Oh, it's nothing now. Just, the agency was gonna drop you like dead weight. But that was only if you didn't come through tomorrow. Listen, I have to go. All right, pal. See you in the morning. Get some air. Hello ? Hello ? Are you-- are you almost done in there ? Ok, sit down. I'm zora's daughter. My name's Mira. We are worried about you. Sometimes I think you've gone crazy in here, with the newscast thing and the constant cleaning. This is mirabel, reporting live from zora's new age clairvoyants. You know, someday, all this will be yours. You know, I would try giving Phil dry food for a bit. Do you know that diet stuff ? Uh-huh. Because it sounds like he might just be eating too much. ( Sighing ) What if I was meant to do something else ? Like what ? I don't know. So, you're on a journey ? See ? ( Mumbling ) You know... ( Clock ticking ) You know, I feel like you've lost something. Not something material, like these. I mean something internal. You know, I know this sounds strange, but I almost feel like you're empty. Yeah. ( Sighing ) Could we just focus on the photographs, please ? Oh, ok. Well, I don't usually work like this. You know, it's not like I see everything. But... I do see a color. I don't know, maybe it's nothing, but... Violet. Yes ! That's it ! Violet, miss Violet ! All right. All right. Where is she ? She's... Um, out there. Ah ! And ? I'm sorry, that's all I have. That was pretty good, though. Come on, Max. Let's keep looking. She's seeing for US. She can help. Help US what ? She's told US what we already know. Is this-- is this all we get ? ( Romeo ) It's a sign ! If she can see that now, who knows what she can see later ? I want her to come. ( Bells tinkling ) What's that for ? Uh, um, well, there's so much dust around. You know, you never know when it might come in handy. And, um, well, you never know when an event of civic and newsworthy importance might occur. Nice. ( Sniffing ) Let's go. ( Mira ) So, what's the deal with these photographs ? ( Romeo ) Well, if Max does not find them, then he will lose his girlfriend. God ! Come on, you got to believe in something ! What else are you gonna do ? I'm gonna find Violet and get my pictures back. Max, time out. Shoe-tie. Shoe-tie. Sorry. This is kind of fun. It's like, well, it's like we're on a search, like that t.V. Show: In search of. Yeah. We really got something going here now. We're a team. Hey, there's a dumpster up there. I really want to check it out, ok ? Hey, wait. I'm sorry. How did you do that back there ? What ? The Violet thing. How did you know her name ? That's what she does, Max. N.B.D. Right. But everyone knows it's smoke and mirrors. You can't really tell the future. I don't know. Um, I... I guess i--i just... I look at people, and I try my best to... Just because you don't understand it, Max, doesn't mean it's all smoke and mirrors. You just got to go with the flow, ok ? ( Rat squealing ) Jesus Christ ! Did you see the size of that thing ? Average. ( Romeo and Mira chattering ) So, you're a photographer ? I take photographs, yeah. He's just being modest. He's bigtime. Famous. Thank you. ( Man ) I'm not who you think I am. ( Woman ) Don't pull that crap with me. Come on, answer the question ! Leave me alone ! Please ! Help me ! Help me, piss off ! Please ! Piss off. Piss off, people. Piss off ! It's-- it's all right, she's--she's leaving. Are you ok ? What are you guys doing out on a work night ? Well, just hours ago, this young man beside me was in the possession of 10, that's right, 10 8 by 10 glossy photographs. And now he's lost them, frittered them away. Max, here, fears a life, a lonely life filled with despair, wandering around on the streets of New York, a nothing. A plankton, a bottom dweller, a toothache. A tiny speck of dust that... Everything. I think he gets it. He gets it. My name is Paul. Yeah, late night ! ( Sputtering ) Why are these guys throwing you a bachelor party on a Monday night ? More grog ! Another round. Make it a double for Paulie. Cool. These guys are some pretty serious partiers, aren't they ? Yeah. And so am I. I'm gonna go get some chicks, ok ? ( Sighing ) Yeah. Don't worry. I'll bounce back. I love her with all my heart. We're doing this for you, uh. It's your last chance to rage. I'll be here. ( Laughing ) Maybe you should get some fresh air. That's a good idea. Oh, my god ! Oh, my god ! Hi. Hi. ( Paul ) So anyway, I came, I saw, I conquered. This Saturday, and the man is o.T.M. What's o.T.M. ? Off the market, baby. Can't touch this. Stop! Hoo ! I'm a warrior tonight ! Hoo ! Let's grog. Max, what's the deal with these snapshots, anyway ? It's photographs. It's not snapshots. Photographs. Whatever. Can we tell him ? Yeah, sure. But-- I don't care, but can we go ? We're on a quest for Cher's photo album. Cher ? Yeah. Cool, I dig her ! We know a few people in common, actually. What do you do, romster ? It's--it's Romeo, actually, and, uh, I'm an aspiring writer. God, a writer and a photographer. I don't know anybody like you guys. Well, I don't know any seers, either. It took me a while to find my passion: Accounting. ( Mira ) Mmm-hmm. And you're a fortune teller ? Kind of. So, what's with the newscasting stuff ? Um, it's just for fun. Hey ! You should get one of those public-access cable shows. You'd be great. I've got a friend who's got a show on Tuesdays. You could call him. You know, those guys write off everything. Everything. Cable, movies, Broadway theater, um, the circus, art fairs-- yeah, maybe I will. So, Romeo, what have you written ? Uh, well, nothing yet. Hey. Hey, don't worry about him. You're a writer. Aspiring. Eventually, you're going to have to sit down and write something. Otherwise, you're just gonna feel like shit. I don't feel like shit. I got abrusso. Bullshit. Abrusso, or whatever it is, it's all fine and good, but don't let that be an excuse. You got to sit down, and you got to write. I try to write every day. And what makes you think I feel like shit ? You don't even have a ribbon for your typewriter. You got to be in the game in order to win. Not everybody can just do it, Max ! Not everybody is like you ! Wow, man, you haven't shot anything this honest all year. Yeah, thanks. Let's just drop it. Sorry. ( Ticking ) ( Wind howling ) ( Mira ) Hey, cool, let's look in here. ( Romeo ) Now this is where we should've been looking. ( Paul ) "Welcome to the thunderdome." ( Max ) Romeo. Romeo, wait up ! ( Romeo ) Look around. There's gonna be good stuff here. ( Max ) Paul ! Where you going ? I'm going to drain the main vein. Warrior has had too much grog. Drainage necessary. ( Glass shattering ) Hey, is everyone ok ? Nice. ( Mira ) Max ? Hello ? ( Paul ) Uh, dudes ! Little help here. Maxie ! Ran into a little trouble with the old vein drain. Just a little snag. Help. Don't move. Are you hurt ? I don't think so. Just stuck. ( Sighing ) Max ? Romeo ! ( Romeo ) Mira. You ok ? Where did you guys go ? Man, I hope I didn't rip my pants. Judy loves these pants. I couldn't find you anywhere. ( Max ) I want to show you guys something. Just come out to the light. Uncool, man. I still got to take a leak. ( Mira ) This place is creepy. ( Paul ) That was crazy. ( Romeo) Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! I'm-I'm sorry, but... Look. See, I knew we should come here. Where did you get it ? This is crazy. Ok, I gotta go home. But this--this is your bachelor night. Come on ! You don't get another one. ( Mira ) Yeah, it's cold, and I'm dirty. I'm gonna go, too. ( Romeo ) Don't go. ( Max ) Let's sit down someplace. How about a drink ? ( Paul ) Ok, I know just the place. ( Music playing ) ( Max ) "Just the place" was the normal inn, where I had started the evening. I knew I wouldn't find any photographs there, but that was starting not to matter. Warrior need grog badly ! I love these dive bars downtown. Very hip. Oh, yeah. Only the most serious of partiers hangs out in a place like this. Hey, Max, what comes before part "b" ? What ? Part "a" ! What ? ( People chattering ) ( Music playing ) Hey, what happens if we don't find Violet ? I will lose everything. Even Cher ? Cher. Well, Cher and I go way back, and we're pretty tight. She may stick with me, but it's a risk. A risk. We'd better get back out there, then. No, no, sit down. We came here for a drink. ( Man ) You took this picture ? ( Romeo ) He's big time, famous. ( Marcello ) You haven't shot anything this honest all year. ( Mira ) I feel like you've lost something. Something internal. You're empty. ( Paul ) Max ! That worm has l.S.D. In it. Make you see Moses. Max, don't drink that. Hey, you. What are you-- what are you doing in New York ? I live here now. I've been here about 2 months. What are you-- what are you doing ? Hi. Hi. Uh, sit down, please. Sit down. These--these are my, uh, friends. These are my friends. Hi. Hi. Amy. Paul. Hi, my name's Romeo. I'm Mira. Thank you. So, what are you-- what are you... Oh, I just... I live around the corner. I don't know, I just came in here. Can I get you a drink ? No, no. Uh-uh. I'm good. Amy and I are, uh, are old friends. Uh, Paul, do you remember, um, you were talking about worms and Moses ? What sea did Moses cross ? Moses came down after getting those stones and said, "come on, people. Let's get out of here." Rocks, actually. Igneous rocks. St. igneous. The patron Saint of the rocks. ( Romeo ) And to answer your first question, Mira, uh, Moses parted the sea of tranquility, which, actually... Is the sea on which Noah sailed upon, uh, a bit later that year. So, this is what you've been doing since we broke up ? You go out late at night, and you discuss... Is it-- is this religion ? Yeah, every--every Monday night, we all-- the 4 of US get together and discuss different topics. Astronomy, historical figures, and, uh, sports legends, and tonight is--is--is... Religion. Religion. Ok. No, wait, that's wrong. Noah sailed on the wave of the flood. The sea of tranquility was where Jesus Christ walked upon water. Jesus walked for 40 days, I think. The 40 days of lent. ( All laughing ) Sorry, just, um, brush my teeth. ( Slurping ) ( Sighing ) "40 days of lent." ( Laughing ) Do you think she likes me ? Of course, dude. Really ? ( Sighing ) All right, what do I do ? Take her out for tapas. It's really good stuff. These little things. You get a few dozen, it's like a huge meal. Ok. It's a funny group, huh ? Yes. They're not what I expected. What ? They're great. I think they're totally great. I just-- I just always pictured you with miss glamour puss and the rest of them. Schuyler. Yeah. She's still in the picture. Hey, I didn't mean anything by that. I mean, we met at this great crafts fair. What can I say ? She just blew me away. ( Max ) It occurred to me to tell the group, to come clean about the photos. But I stopped myself. I didn't want the night to end. Are you going on a honeymoon ? Yeah. Going to this really cool dude ranch. ( Romeo ) Only a year, and they're already getting married. ( Paul ) Well, we're both huge art lovers. ( Chair squeaking ) It's hot back here. ( All laughing ) Where did you get this shirt ? The bartender gave it to me. Max, that looks like one of your photographs ! It is. This just in: They've found another one. I want to dance. Romeo tells me that he's quite the dancer. May I ?

( Max ) No, I'm not coming home. I--i... There's 4 more. Sounds like you're at a party. ( Sighing ) Trust me, ( Max laughing ) It's not a party that you'd wanna be at. I've got some news, Max. I need to see you. What is it ? Tell me now. I don't want to tell you on the phone. Just come home. Schuyler. It's marcello. Vivica just called. They found him on the street below. I--i don't know what happened. Maybe he fell. They said he'd been drinking. He's dead. I'm sorry. What ? He's dead, baby. Got something for you, coach. Don't lose these. These are your ticket back. I don't have these. Maybe it's over. Maybe it's over. ( Max ) It's never too late to fix your mistakes. Right ? ( Romeo ) He can't be gone. I'm afraid he is. I just saw him run out the door. But what did he say about coming back ? Nothing. I didn't even get to say goodbye to him. He--he can't have left. How will he know what to do with his photographs ? He--he needs US. You guys, I'm gonna go. Um, it was really-- I had a good time. It was really fun. So can you just... Can you give him my number, if you see him ? But--but Max would want you to be here. Yeah, Max will be fine. I gotta go. Take care. Bye. Bye, Paul. Take care. Good night. He'll be really disappointed, though, when you're not here when he gets back. No, let's call it a night. I think Judy's probably very worried by now. Oh, come on, man. We're a team now. We're together. He's right. That's it. It's over. Life back to normal. What ? You, of all people-- what--what are you going to do now ? Go back to your storefront ? Come on, we're having fun now. Romeo, there's nothing wrong with my storefront. I know, I know. I'm not-- I'm just saying-- I'm just saying that Max is coming back. We're having fun, and we should stay together. Come on. Hey, barkeep, another round. Another round of grog. ( Ticking ) No. No, wait. Please. Please ! Wait ! ( Cell phone ringing ) ( Panting ) Hello. ( Schuyler ) Max ? Are you ok ? I think, maybe I found her. Who ? Violet. The photos. How do you know ? where are you ? Small street. Benson. ( Max ) In the beginning, the photos were going to save my career. Outside Violet's, I was just looking for answers. Hello ? H-Hello ? ( Woman humming ) Yes ? Is someone there ? Are you Violet ? Yes. I've come for the photographs. Come in. Is it too dark ? No. It's ok. It's good to finally rest for a minute. Of course. Can I have them ? What ? The photographs. You know, the black-and-white ones. The silhouettes. No. I'm sorry. But you're Violet. I'm sorry. I am Violet, but... Come on. You don't know what I'm talking about ? No. Explain them to me. What do they look like ? ( Whimpering ) ( Sobbing ) My eyes are killing me. Close your eyes for a bit. Rest. I am sorry for bothering you. They made you out to be some kind of superwoman. Mmm. I was so sure that you would be the answer, and have all the photographs. I'm sorry I didn't live up to your expectations, but I am just a person. Just like, uh, just like all of US.

Um, well, Amy's gone, but she told me to give you this. Yeah. And, uh, Paul's in the bathroom. ♪ All night long ♪ ( Ticking ) ( Wind howling ) ( Max ) Let's go in. Before we go in, I have something that I want to show you. ( Sniffling ) ( Phil ) It's a snapshot. Some-- someone slipped it under my door when you guys came by to get your fortunes. It's Violet. She's a really well-known person on the street and when I saw that you had snapshots that looked like it, I knew that she was involved. I'm sorry. I just really wanted to come along. Don't worry about it. Look, we're going to go in here and we're going to hang out with Violet for a bit, and then, we're done. ( Panting ) ( Max ) What are you... Greg ? I'm here to make sure this thing happens. ( Schuyler ) I was so worried. You told me where you were, on the phone. Schuyler, you can't-- god, Max, I thought you'd be happy to see me. Let's all relax. Can we see these shots, Max ? Wow ! Contrasty. Beautiful. Really nice. Max, you're the man. Greg, listen. I have some really good ideas for some other shots I saw tonight. And I was thinking that if you could give me a little more time, i-- there's no more time, Max. You know, forget about more shots. These are great. These are better than great. Fuck Cher at this point. We're talking top-tier names, Max. What if I don't have the negatives ? Don't worry, man. It's original. It'll be a big one-time sale. I even like that t-shirt. He's here now, so could we see the other photo ? She doesn't have any more. I was wrong on the phone. No, no. She says she has one. Violet ? Right here. I just thought you needed some time to rest. Max ! Is this it ? Are--are there any more ? There's one more. I gave the last one to a friend who lives uptown. He works in the park. ( Greg ) Let's go, Max ! Jesus, come on ! ( Mira ) I'm so sorry that I lied about Violet. You must think I'm a real fraud. No. I understand what you do. You make people have faith. This has been so much fun. Yes. So, you think I'll ever be a writer ? Romeo, you already are a real writer. Someday, everyone is gonna see that. Are you seeing that ? Yes, I guess I am. You know, you should come by the store sometime, maybe, and meet the rest of my family. I think they would really like you. What ? Of course you should use them. I can do this on my own. It's been a long night. Let's just get this last one and talk about it in the morning. Look at you, you're a mess. What happened to you tonight ? God ! Max. I just wanted to tell you that I have had a great night ! I mean, wait till I tell Judy about this ! I wish she could have seen this. Head butt ! No, Paul ! Paul ! So what's the spread on that last game ? Greg. Ok, put me down for $500, then. Actually, you know what ? Bump that up to $1,000. Greg, you need to speak to him. Forget it. Just forget it. Listen, any guy who misses his fiancee during his own bachelor party... You are making an awesome decision. Yeah. ( Grunting ) ( Exclaiming ) ( Max ) All right. All right. I love you guys. Hold--hold on one second. We got a group hug, hold on. All right, love you guys. Max, look. ( Wind howling ) ( Horse snuffling ) Are you Violet's friend ? I have been known to run an errand or 2 for her. It's you. I think you have something of ours. Schuyler, just hold on. You must be the photographer. He is. He is. It's here. Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Would you like to come for a ride ? Uh, no, that's ok. Thanks. Sure. ( Hooves clomping ) Update, update: This is mirabel, coming to you live from a horse cart in the magnificently beautiful central park. Max, you'll have a private showing. Get the buzz going. It'll be all about you and the journey you've taken. I'll get in file to do something on it. We'll get sponsors, maybe a fragrance, gift bags... This has been a story of life and death. All 10 photos in one night, giving our hero... Where do you wanna go ? Belvedere castle. Max. We have all of them. Let's just go home. It's not over yet. ( Mira ) ...That has given this reporter a new eye on the world. This is mirabel, reporting live. ( Snorting ) ( Church bells tolling ) ( Schuyler shivering ) ( Schuyler ) This is great, but can we go now ? ( Max ) Relax a minute. We did it. All 10 in one night. ( Greg ) Breathe it all in, Max. This is the big one, pal. Ah, look. It's a nice view. ( Birds chirping ) Where did he go, Max ? Doesn't matter. ( Schuyler ) Max, no ! Oh, my god ! Oh, my god. Cool. Are you crazy ? ( Laughing ) That's beautiful, Max. That's it. You're fucking crazy. That's you, Max. Always been a wild card. Take care of yourself. After all that... Cool. They didn't matter. Yes, they did. Nice. Yeah. Abrusso. ( Max ) In everyone's life, there are defining moments.
