MONKEY GRIP (1982) soundtrack Christina Amphlett & The Divinyls : subtitles by van26 NORA: sometimes long afterwards it's possible to look back and see the beginning of things the point at which you'd already plunged in although at the time you thought you were only testing the water with your toe. (Fitzroy, bikes) Chou baby! - Chou baby ! You're the dirty rascal! You're the dirty rascal! You can't get me! Want to go now? - Oh not for a while. You know Javo, do ya? -Sort of. G'day! G'day. Javo's coming down the Bay for the weekend with us. - Oh yeah? Pity you don't want to come. OK! I'll come. NORA: It wasn't as if I didn't already had someone to love. There was Martin, teetering on the dizzy edge of smack like so many others that summer. He was as much a part of our household as any outsider could have been. He slept very still in my bed, jumped up with the kids in the early morning And somehow put up with my crankiness and fits of wandering heart. But now Martin was unhappy, And to my shame I wasn't concerned with kindness. I was happy then, it was early summer And at night our backyard smelt like the country. And then as it always happens everything began to heave and change... This is pathetic Mum! We're not even gonna get a swim in. That's right - tomorrow... I thought you didn't like the beach? No, I don't like the sand. It gets up your bum. You'd rather swim in all that peee would ya? How's the break going? - Still trying to get thru the introduction. Half of it's in bloody German. What's going on with you and Martin? - did he say something to you? He thinks you're getting sick of him. See, it's all in the lighting mate, it's too moody or something, too 70s, know what I mean? Too 70s ? Too 70s. See look. Tell you what - forget all that. Just give me a 10 x 8... How are ya ? - Gday. All right, OK. You can do it darling. Thought you were meant to be rehearsing. - Yeah I was. How many ways can you say 4 lines. Fair enough. Thought we might be able to duck out and have some lunch. Oh mate I'd like to, but I just can't get away from here. And then I've got to pick Gracie up I'm supposed to be showing up at this. You an art critic too? No I'm a speculator, I'm meant to be reviewing it . Would you like to come? - Yeah I'll come. Well I don't think there's much I can do .. Oh hang on a min. mate, my daughter's here. Gday. - Hello. Hi I've got someone on the phone. -OK Ah Don look, I'll give you a ring back in about an hour mate. No - minny Actually, make that 10 minutes. All right, great. What's this? Oh it's Diana's. - what's all this? - Mine. Hey you've got new glasses! - You've got a new shirt. You've got a new haircut. - You've got new shoes! You've got new teeth. - You've got a big bum! Hey I've got a proposition. What's that? - Can Gracie stay the night? Yeah sure. - How are ya? What time does it start? That'll be two dollars for her, and four dollars for you. - I'm an arts student, College of the Arts. Free for arts students isn't it? If you show me your student card, I can give you a concession. Must have left it at home. Don't worry, just let me in. I can't do that! Don't give me the sh--s. You can't keep me out. Art belongs to the people. Look I don't make the rules here, I'm just doing what I'm told. Oh you just do what you're told do ya? Why can't you show some f--king initiative sometimes? What's the problem here? - Hold that, pal ... Hey! Sorry. Excuse me madam, you can't touch the exhibits, all right? JAVO: Psst! Want to buy a watch? What do you say we get out of here? Yeah, I reckon. # I'm gonna get you # (what did you ask for - two beers? Three beers) # I'm gonna get it right if it takes all night # # I'm gonna get it right # What's her name? - Angela. Really good isn't she? - Yeah .. they're playing well. I've been attempting to write the lyrics for her. # I'm gonna make you say you want me to stay, hey # # I'm gonna make you say # # Oh, got to get through to you # Oh, something that we can do # # Oh tell you I'm wanting to # # I'm gonna get you # # I'm gonna get you # # I'm gonna get you # # I'm gonna get you # ANGELA: OK thank you. We'll be back soon I'm off in a minute. What are you doing? ... with some more tales of heartbreak, jealousy and revenge. See you soon. Going your way. Oh yeah. Martin be at your place? Probably not. (scraping) CLIVE: Is that you Martin? Oh. You looking for Martin? No. -G'day how's it going? Oh you have done a lot. Mmm. Thought I might hit it with a bit of paint tonight ... just to relieve the monotony. Oh all the best. Hmmm ... not interested in renting a room are you? See you mate. Would you like to stay? - That'd be good. Are you nervous? Don't be. It's all that scraping. You listening or something? What I'd tell you? - Can you turn out the light? I have to get up early in the morning for Gracie. - Don't worry mate. Nothing wakes me. Love getting into bed when my ears are still ringing... MARTIN: G'day mate. Nora about? Mmm hmm. - Javo? - Ah look mate. I don't know what's going on. Did she say anything? Oh well, tell her I'll give her a call or. Yeah, sure. At last I've found someone that f--ks soft. What time is it? GRACIE: 8:30. You slept in. I need a dollar to go to the clown show. - The what? The clown show. What about your lunch? Want some money for that? Eve's already made it. Hello! - G'day! C'mon Gracie, I'm going! All right. Bye mate. Think she's trying to tell me something. Oh she just doesn't like change. Morning! EVE: g'day Oh tea's up - that's good. Clive trying to beat the price structure again is he? EVE: what's happening with you and Javo? You're not doing it again are you? Yeah I s'pose I've done it again. - Oh God I'll thump you , Nor. You know what you're doing, don't you? You're looking at every new one and you're saying : is this the one? That's not what I'm doing. Look I don't want to sound like your mother, But you will ! Well what future is there in it? I'm not all that worried about futures. I don't want to love anyone for ever. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy. Apart from anything else he's a junkie No he's not. He got off it. He got off it in Tasmania. C'mon Nor ! You going now? Yep. what are you planning? - I think I'll go home. So see ya when I see ya... Yep - see ya. Who's is this anyway? It's blunt. - Dunno. Martin's probably. See ya! NORA: See ya when I see ya. What was that supposed to mean? I think I already knew this one was going to be trouble. Still, a person shouldn't be ashamed to wish for love. What's Martin doing here? Does he just want to get things straightened out does he? Smart ass ! How was the clown show? Really terrible - it turned out to be a puppet show! It was really stupid. Baby stuff. You could even see the strings! - You can always see the strings mate. Hi Mondo. - G'day (oooh true love hey. Oh shut up) Can I come over ? - Course you can. Yuck. I said no honey! - Well I'll have it won't I? Martin I don't know what to say to you, you know. - I just want to know uh, what's going on. I mean last week we were all buddies, and now it's... Maybe that was the problem. Oh sorry mate - you sounded funny. - don't be sorry. Now you don't want to f--k with me and you won't talk with me. I don't just miss you, I miss him. Everything's cool, then derrr... good night nurse. It was easy to begin so it's easy to end. Oh that sounds stupid. Easy for who? I mean like, I don't really - G'day mate! - G'day. What's everyone having for tea? - Vegetable curry, but ah, we don't start serving until 8. Might watch some TV then. I had a bit of a talk with Martin, thinks I shouldn't feel guilty ... Does he? What do you think? Think I back-doored him. Don't be pathetic, that's boys talk. He's my friend. - So am I. Is that all? - No... NORA: We slept together three nights in a row. In those three days I drifted pleasantly in a haze while Martin wept and Javo felt confused. Three nights in a row was enough to make it too late. MARTIN: I meant like, you're doing a soap commercial they obviously want some old dear with three kids, Or not an old dear but ... of a reasonable age and you turn up with all plastic?? on, chopsticks in your hair Of course you do. Is she attractive? See. No, it's absolutely true. It's to do with the fact that you're good looking. So you're not going to get that kind of job. Yeah but I mean, people on the list All I had to say was F**k off! - Come here. You're making me look like an idiot. I just want to talk to you. - Go and talk to Rita will you ! Half the problem is, certain people ... you're beautiful right? Easier for you to Chat someone up. I mean why do you dress like you do? What's wrong with it? - well it's obviously dressed To attract people... I mean that's what it's for. Dear Javo, there's a few things you ought to know. Mostly involving things like elementary courtesy. Like saying hello. Like not making that ludicrous adolescent gap between how you behave towards me at night when we sleep together, and how you act in public as if we hardly knew each other. Don't get me wrong, I don't want a flood of attention. Just hello would do, so I don't have to wonder if I've been hallucinating other times we've been together. Good luck to you Javo, I like you and I'd still like to see you some time. I brought you a note, I didn't think you'd be here. But now I'm here I feel pretty uncomfortable so, I think I'll go. Hey Nor, hang on a min. - Fast recovery. Look last night, I was sure I didn't want to see you any more. - Oh. - But I don't feel like that now. Look you give me a hard time but I understand why you do it. Well I wish you'd tell me, because I don't know why I do it. Well, you just don't want me to need you, do ya ? No. No that's got nothing to do with it. - Well that's how it feels! I just find it really hard to come on like that when there's people around. Oh that's bullsh-t mate, you were doing all right with Martin and Lillian. That's different, they're friends. Well what am I? Look Nor you know how I feel; I really want to keep seeing ya. I can't read your mind, I don't know you so well that I can tell these things. For all I knew, you were trying to tell me you'd had enough. I know. - So what do ya mean? - you just don't get it, do ya? Oh what? - look when I said I was stoned, I meant smack. Well why didn't you tell me that? - Didn't seem like a very good idea at the time. Jesus Carl, what did you light this with, a bloody cigarette lighter mate? You're going to look beautiful .. now let's have ya. Marlene Dietrich always insisted on being mentioned way up there. Oh there's a nice lady. ANGELA: Who am I going to look like? Hello? Yes, hang on ... Nora? Is this music helping? - Martin here. - Martin! - Got a moment? Yeah we got a bit of a problem mate. Javo's sick. Think he's had a dirty hit or something. I rang Mac, and we got him to the hospital but. - When can we see him? - Now. Better already - didn't give me nothing, my body's beaten it. Last night mate I thought you were a dead one. You've still got a fever. - That's nothing ! I know people who've had it and only stayed in for a day. Blood poisoning. Who? -Schultzy had it Remember Schultzy? He got it, he was all right . Ta mate. These old people give me the sh-ts. Old guy over there, he reckons he's dying but he keeps pissing his pyjamas just so he can call the nurse. Real senile. Good dope isn't it ? We'd better go, put that out. - yeah see you later mate. Well don't tell mummy ... I'm sorry you have to go. I'm alone now and then - will you come again? Yep. - Oh please. - Bye... I'll try to come in tomorrow, bring you something to eat and something to read. Yeah don't worry - just go. What are you doing here? - I couldn't take it, pissed off. Told them I had someone who'd look after me. - Oh did you? Thought you didn't like it here . it was too domestic for you. I only get to see you when you're desperate. They said OK if I could get a doctor to take responsibility. - Oh Mac I s'pose. Yeah I rang Mac, he said he'd come over later, teach me how to give a penicillin injection. Oh really? Ah! Christ what are you f**king doing? - You tensed your muscles, bum like an elephant. Sh**! give it us here, I'll do it better myself. GRACIE: Yuck don't do it! You'll get hooked. Aaahhh ... Aren't you going to see RayMondo before he goes? He reckons it's his birthday. I know! - Oh I see. It's ridiculous, I can't give it to him like that. - What did you rub out? - I wrote "love from Gracie" . It's not funny. - Mmm hmm. - It's a mess isn't it. Well, you just cut the bottom off it. Oh yeah. - Oh yeah. I don't get this joke. - It's easy. What she's saying is like - I write down what gives me the s---s about you, and you write down what .. You know , they give each other the sh--s? It's for you Mondo. Reckon that's really neat don't you? - Yeah .. it is neat. (scorn) Yeah that's really neat! NORA: He didn't stay around our house for long, and the truth was, I didn't really want him to. I couldn't live for long with his restlessness, his violent changes of mood, the dangerous idleness in the bloodstream. How come you moved in here? - Just needed a change of scenery. Have you fallen out with Martin? No no , we're still going on our trip. - what trip? You know - Asia. - Are you fair dinkum? - Yeah. How can you afford a trip ... I don't want to know. When are you going? - Week after next, maybe. How old are you in this? - Oh sixteen, seventeen. What was it like? - Air Force? Sh-t, terrible. Only thing the Air Force ever showed me was how to tidy up me room and fold blankets. Is that your mother? Yeah. She's great - should meet her some time. Who's that? Who's the arm? - The old man. Someone must've torn the bastard right out of the picture. God he was a sh-t. Once when I was in the Air Force... Christ I hated that place. All I could ever think about was getting out. He could have got me out. All he had to do was wack his signature on a couple of papers. He wouldnt do it. No way. I begged the bastard, used to plead with him. Not him. Sometimes now when I keep mucking things up with a woman and that, I think yeah yeah , he's the reason I do it - that bastard. What do you mean? Like I always got plenty of woman's love. - Never quite hit the mark? Yeah, something like that. He sent me a card from Singapore, something he wrote on the plane. "A love with no fade from distance." Nothing more. NORA: I remember a dream that I had not long after he'd gone. Javo and I were walking along a beach There was no one else in sight. I remember trying to say some difficult emotional things. Something like - I love you so much that if I thought you didn't love me, I'd die. I stopped talking, looked sideways at him waiting for him to speak, but he remained silent, and I realised that he didn't love me like that. By late autumn our old house had been sold under us, and we all went our separate ways. As a last resort Gracie and I moved into a huge house down by the markets with Rita and her daughter Juliette. I should have known better. And then one day near the beginning of winter, I heard my first news of Javo. He and Martin were stranded in a Bangkok prison, busted for stealing sunglasses. I was writing to him almost daily, afraid for his safety but having no means of helping him. Sending letters to nowhere and getting nothing back. Oh pig! Put it away! OD-ed on the bread again. .. just because you haven't had a f--k for weeks. Get, you'll ruin my picture! You planning something desperate? Nah, something's bound to fall in my path sooner or later. I think I can safely say I hate that picture. They look so bloody smug. NORA: Naturally I remembered only the good and lovable things about him, and not the wretchedness he caused me. The dope and the resentments and silences, and the half crazy outbursts. Instead I was remembering the colour of his eyes, and the way he'd throw back his head when he laughed These things I could recall in an instant. But I knew for the sake of truth and sanity that I had to keep some balance in my memory of him. WILLIE: what's this, a nostalgic visit? No Javo just wanted me to collect some of his things. Is he still in prison over there? I don't know what's happening . Martin's father's trying to bail him out. Here - try some of this. - Ta. Sorry. - Mmm it's good Did you make it? - No. You hungry? - You on your own? Just for a while. Are you sure? - OK. ... He said I'll fix it. He went in , found out it was 17 bucks, came out and demanded forty from me! You still in love with him? - I miss him a real lot. Yeah. Like you miss a piece of glass in the foot . Love. What I feel for you isn't exactly love but then it isn't just sex, either. I'm finding it really exciting being in this room with you, and I'm going to be extremely pissed off if the others start coming back. Why don't you stay? - Because if Angela showed up, I'd freak. Angela! Angela won't come back.. what's all this about Angela? She's me mate. - I'm your mate! Oh Willy - I couldn't handle it	. Rita's putting the sh--s up Angela as it is and it's complicated enough. And we're mates. It doesn't matter if we f--k now or later or never .. I'm really enjoying getting good at karate. When anybody comes at me, all I have to do is just, I just drop back every time. Wacker. That's it. Big stretch - Midget hands. And the other one was - down to an E. F sharp E - That's it. - OK. - Yeah. Yeah give it a burl. Hit it! # No relief with the break of day # # feels like you're melting away # # the ghost of love is holding you. # # Your mirror has drawn a blank # # Don't know whether to fight or faint # # Ghosts of love following you. # # hear them sing a familiar thing # # Phantom choir # # you were surprised # # as each ? flies # # higher and higher ..ah # Very tasty. I think it's beaut. -Your lyrics mate. Me first rock 'n roll song. - Here's to it. - Just like a bought one. Want to try another one? No I should go I think. - don't have to you know. Yes I do. What difference is that gonna to make? - Might make you sound a bit less like a garage band ay. That tom's a bit flat, can you break it up a bit? It's all a bit of worry really isn't it? All this technology being brought to bear on a modest little song we wrote. You're worried. - I just hope we can get it up tonite. Considering what we're up against. Very exciting ay? When's it all going to start? About dawn I'd say... How come Angela hasn't shown up? She was here, and now she's gone... RITA: What's this? Will and Angie been brawling again? OK - I need a level from you, get this show on the road ay. Mmmm look at Willy. I always want to f--k with him when I watch him play. - After you. Hey we were wondering where you were.. - No doubt about where you're at though, is there ? What do you mean? - Just want to say that I don't hate you any more like I have been for the last few weeks Hate me ? I didn't notice. I must be a bit insensitive. Yeah. Part of the trouble actually I've been thinking you were some kind of sexual predator. If you wanted to f--k with someone you didn't give a damn who else might be involved like when? Oh with Martin and this thing with Javo and now I ve heard you've been putting it on Willy too. I've been thinking you've got this habit of using people up and just throwing them away but it's all right because I don't hate you any more. # I know all about girlfriends # It's twenty minutes past four. Let's make this the one ay? - Danny wants to go home. # I know all about girlfriends # # I know all about those friends # # I know all about girlfriends # # You'd better know you're the target here # # You better know she's a pistoleer. # # A cameo then she'll disappear # # Disappear. # # You'd better know you're the target here # # You better know she's a pistoleer # # A cameo then she'll disappear # # Disappear. # # She'll just use you # # then she'll walk out on you ... oh # Listen ah what key are we singing in? - I was flat uh? Can we give it a bit of edge? Make it a bit angry hey? Supposed to hate this woman hey. Yeah OK OK. # I know all about girlfriends # # I know all about those friends # # I know all about girlfriends # # I know all ... # FRANK: Listen kids ah, why don't we just fade out on that last chorus hey. We've got one that'll do the job, and uh it could be a lot less painful, ay. ANGELA: F--k! We do it her way, Frank. - Not tonight, we don't. Sorry I dumped all that crazy stuff on you. I'm a bit pissed and I'm tired. Oh Willy, I don't know what he wants any more . Me .. you .. Rita, or all three of us! I'm tired Nor. Stuff these boring perfectionists! Will you take me home? - Yep. (singing) A drink of wine and then he goes Leaving behind his pain and woes. You give me my gloves back! You you .. Thanks a lot. What's the matter? Javo's journal? He's back! You're going to cry! You lucky duck. Javo! Javo ... My heart's full for you. (the play) Put your arms around me. And hold me close .. just for a while. Well you won't take no for an answer will you? (I feel like tearing this place apart) (the play) Well then wreck the place Arthur. And we'll go away together. We can't leave. I owe money! I wouldn't last a week. You don't know what it's like Lying beside you and wanting you so badly. Walked out last week without paying. He's standing at the bar! Better bring the girl in (the play) You! get dressed. Talk about a cheapskate! We'll have to teach him the value of money. NORA: Now that he was back, all the splinters of my life made sense again but almost straight away we began to misunderstand each other I didn't want to hold on to the way things had been Or stop him from hitting up or be with him 24 hours a day, But it was losing our old ease together that I hated. Just wanted to see ya. Look I really want to have a talk with you, can we have a cup of coffee or something when you're finished? - Yeah. What do you want to eat ? I cashed my pension cheque this morning so .. - Just give me a plate of gnocchi, that'll do. JAVO: Hang on, I just want to see if I can score a cigarette. # little senorita # Thanks Roberto. # little senorita # # little senorita # Lily, she's too much. - Yeah. What's this for? It's for the bill. I was just going to leave. - That's stupid mate, I just got carried away. C'mon we've got to open this play tonight. Actually working with Lillian's been a bit weird What's the matter? - It just feels like she's lining you up. I probably just hate her because she's prettier than me, it doesn't matter. Isn't going down too well. - Try and eat something. - I reckon it's off. It's perfectly all right and it cost four bucks. Eat it. (the play) Get me a drink Arthur, I'm dying in this heat (the play) What'll it be mister? You're obviously here on business. First drink's on the house! Gin. - In that case make it a double. Hey babe you're a sight for sore eyes. Need some new talent round here. (the play) Look I know you're not going to go through with this. Arthur are you trying to back out? I just know you back to front that's all. You're new to the game Gonna spew... - shooting up again, have you? (clean up here .. only competition) (the play) you'll clean up here.. your only competition! Sucking booze out of a rag .. I heard that. Jesus what a f--g embarrassment. (She's drinking the place dry.) I was hoping you'd take it with ya. You don't have to hang around, Arty! What's with him! You can't f--g walk off stage in the middle of a play! Jesus Chri (laughing) The Crk ?? will do a job on us. "Technicolor yawn stops play" . We're going to go now. See you guys. Want to come? - I'm going to drop round at Al's place, pick up some stuff. They're my friends too you know I know that. I never said anything. I'm not trying to organise your life. Nor hey Nor! Hey? Nor. Nor! NORA: When he was stoned, he usually kept out of my way disappeared for days at a time, then turned up at some crazy hour of the night to creep into my bed for comfort like some sick helpless child I would have done anything to help him, but it wasn't my help that he wanted. It wasn't dope as a spectre or rival that frightened me, it was the way it turned him into a stranger. Juliette get out from under my feet! - No. I am trying to make a cup of tea. I want some Milo! - I know you want. Your junkie friend's cleaned out the kitty again! Go on Julia get a glass, I'll make you some Milo. Go outside. Javo. You left your fit on the dining room table! Bullsh-t, left it here - Oh mate don't be stupid. do you think I hallucinated it? Rita doesn't know you bring dope here. Why do you have to make it so hard for me? I told you Nora! Fffing left it here. I can't handle it! Javo I want you to understand, I love you a real lot but I can't handle you when you're like this! Better if you found somewhere else to stay, to sleep Till you've got it under control a bit, or Look I want to stop, but I can't do it now. When will you be able to? - I can't stop while the play's on. I couldnt get thru it! I can't perform when I'm coming down - I know that. I know that. When the play's finished - I'll get off it and Well go away somewhere. We'll go up north. I'm sick of the junk scene. I want to get off it. How? - I'll take a cure, go cold turkey, I can do it! Go to Sydney. See some friends and Go to the beach, get a tan... We'll do it, we'll go ... - I'll fix it! Oh f--k it, we won't go then! Hey you're starting to nod off on me. Here. don't mind givin; the old system a bit of a revving up? Sorry? Beans mate. Pills, shakers.. - I don't know. - Go on get a couple of em into ya. ?? Light out ya bum I'll be turning off shortly so I'll have to drop youse up here wake your family up - Hey Nor! Steak and chips and one egg - $2.25 Spaghetti on toast, $1.85 . Yuck. It's all junk food. The menu ... We'll go to Manly tomorrow and get some oysters. - Oh really? You'se made up your mind yet? Just give us a couple of pies thanks - I can't, me microwave's off. I'll just have an orange juice thanks With a straw. Where you heading for? - Sydney How ya going to get there? - Think we'll have to walk! I could ask my mates, going all the way into town. I could fix it for you. - Thanks Hey Noll, got room for a couple more? Hi! - Hi I'd given up on you. Go up. C'mon Biggles off you get. Pre-warmed. Don't worry about a thing, see you later . What a good idea. Ahhh Race you down to the water! - Not fair, I've got boots, you wait. Geez you're good looking. - You get excruciated when I say things like that don't ya? Twenty bucks OK? - You going out? Yep. Going to see some friends. - See ya when I see ya ( I Ching ) Can I ask you a question? - You're not supposed to interrupt, Nor. Sorry. Which one is it? - Oppression. When the water has flowed out below... the lake must dry up and become exhausted. That is fruit. One sits oppressed under a bare tree and strays into a gloomy valley. For three years one sees nothing. Sounds horrible, what did you ask it ? If we might be going to Manly tomorrow, just us two I mean. What do you feel about Javo? Just be nicer to him and leave him alone. That's what I reckon. You're stoned. You went out for a hit! We've sat around here all day Not knowing whats going on. You've been out trying to score This was supposed to be a holiday. What do you want? - want some Vegemite. You don't care about me and Gracie do ya? You just make empty promises and piss off when it suits you. Why did you have to open your big mouth about Manly? When she really thought you meant it. Don't even notice what anyone else is feeling. I DO! You don't know what's going on in my life. You don't want me to know. - I f--king do! Look you don't understand. You only like me when I'm off dope! And I only like myself when I'm on it. And that's something you'll never accept! When you're cold to me and you shut me out like that, you make me feel ugly and stupid - And boring and I give up. And I wonder why we bother. I don't know ... Neurotic . I do this over and over... whenever I get something good I destroy it. Everyone's got patterns they can't break.. I've got one. It's different from yours. - Yeah? - I go on giving it all away. I'll go back to Melbourne in the morning. - No I'll go. - I love you. - Look um when you get back to Melbourne, I'll probably... Hey Gracie .. want it? - Yeah. Be a dollar. - Bye. Cheer up Nor, you'll get over it. - What do you mean. How would you know? Don't you remember RayMondo and that dumb card? What happened to your love? - Just passed. There's a ferry, look. Oh yeah it's nice at night, NORA: It had been impossible, and now it was over. In a way I felt relieved that at last something had been resolved. For months it seemed I'd been draining myself away towards him, and now it was time to put the plug back in and fill up the tub again, for myself and other people. # I am through with hanging 'round # # all the boys in town # # Now I want a man around # # Get me out of here. # # I am just a red brassière # # To all the boys in town # # Put this bus in top gear # # Get me out of here. # # I must have been desperate! # # I must have been pretty low # # I must have been desperate # # I must have been pretty low # # I was always driving home # # All the boys in town # # But they never telephoned # # Get me out of here. # # I think they're pretty phoney # # You're not like the rest, # # You've heard of matrimony # # They've all flunked the test. # # I must have been desperate! # # I must have been pretty low # # I must have been desperate # # I must have been pretty slow # # oh oh oh oh # # Ooh, I'm tired # # Ooh, I'm wired # # I'm tired .. # # Ooh, I'm wired! # # Ahhhhhh # (guitar break) # Too much too young # # Too much too young # # Too much too young # # Too much too young # # Get me out of here (too much too young) # # Get me out of here (too much too young) # # Get me out of here (too much too young) # # Get me out of here (too much too young) # # Get me out of here (too much too young) # # Get me out of here (too much too young) # # Get me out of here (too much ..) # # Get me out of here! # NORA: I started writing again. A short story about a woman who years after the break up of her marriage, goes to see the other woman, the one she believed to have been the cause of everything She goes there wanting a reconciliation, but ends up discovering to her horror that she only wants to get even. I honestly thought it was going to be amusing. Unbelievable eh ? -Unbelievable. I got so ripped before I came Can't wear these shoes any longer. ... hope this director knows what he's doing! Or else we're in big trouble. Look mate.. if it doesn't work, you can always apply for a grant and make it into a B-grade I feel so stupid, I don't know what all this means. So uncomfortable in that outfit. You're lucky you just write, Nor. Without someone trying to tell you what to do all the time, trying to mold you. So - you're moving into a house with Gerald uh? Well it won't be just the two us. Eve's coming too. Does Rita know about that? -No not yet. See you later. What did Angela want? She was just complaining about her feet Here's your story Ah ta. What did you think? - Fantastic, it's really good . Suppose you've shown it to Lillian? - oh what do ya reckon? Think you better before you try and sell it! I don't think so. It's already sold, anyway. Well I know a nice place up the country where you can go and stay and hole up for a couple of weeks. Give us a break. Cut! Gday .. You going to Rita's ?? - No just want to use it. Oh is that it? - that's the one. Oh fantastic. Where's the cover? Show me show me show me. Who's that? - Me stupid. How did they manage to get you looking like Bruce Springsteen. That's beautiful. # Yes all I want is you # # only only you # # I say you let me down # # only you can # # Paranoia, soul destroyer - Paranoia # Why didn't you give me the choice of coming with you? Because I can't handle you and Juliette. I can't help you with it, and I can't bear it the way it is. What do you mean? Fights? You can't leave each other alone. It's like a war zone. I know. I thought that's what it was. You don't like what's going on between me and Willy either, do you? It's the whole thing, the whole setup. I've been going crazy here. - I can understand that. So I'm leaving. AGENT: Morning. Sorry I'm a little late, look around the grounds? Just wander round, take your time and let me know when you're ready OK. The master bedroom, the master bed. - What do you think? Are you happy about this? I don't know. What's up? You worried about us? I just want it quite clear, we're not moving into the house as a couple. Bit strong isn't it? Not personalities.. I just can't do it any more. We'll have our own rooms. That will establish us separately. Own dressing gowns, muesli, toothbrushes ... You two settled in already? - Oh you're so apt! I like it. - Yeah me too. (piano downstairs) Little bastards! He came in and buggered up our music. - Well you didn't have to hit him. He doesn't get it if you don't hit him. - Shut up, there's someone at the door! - How are ya ? - Thought you'd be at that party. Yeah I was but .. Eve said you were stuck here on your own with the kids. Yeah ... come in. You look great, what happened? Been having a really good time These days I've been knocking around a bit and that seen Lillian a couple of times. I was over there last Sat night. No, getting late, you know. She came to the door with me and said Would you like to stay? So I did. - Why are you telling me all this? Are you pissed off because it's Lillian? I suppose if it had been someone else, might have been easier She reckons she really likes you! - Oh don't give me the sh-ts! Look - there hasn't been one time this year When I could have said I didn't love you. That time I was coming back from Thailand. Look I really needed you and you were there. But I'm starting to feel better now. Getting into it, again. So um I can't just stay with you all the time Left it a bit late to tell me all this didn't you? Come on babe, we can outlast the lot of 'em . We see so little of each other, we're bound to! What are you doing here? - Hey? I live here. I'm waiting to take you to the party. Javo's here. - Yeah I noticed. I don't know why you keep putting yourself thru all that. Neither do I. (party) You wrote the lyrics to that clip. Yeah. - Someone showed me that story you wrote... No I'm not tense. Just want to get a drink. Da dah. - What? It's finally happened. - What. They're f-cking, that's what. She just found out. - Oh mate! Bloody Rita I hate her! - It's not her fault, it's Willy Yeah yeah yeah - what really sh-ts me is, you spend all those years trying to get rid of all that eyelash fluttering then you find out that men really like it. They fall for it every time. Course they do! - Don't say course they do What's all the theorising been about, about how cool it should be between people? What's that for? - You two finally got it on. - Some achievement hey. So much for multiple relationships. - Oh yeah well it was like that with us Reason I had to put a stop to me and you was mainly Angela's jealousy. I starting having so many dreams and fantasies about you I couldn't tell which was which. - That's easy. Dreams are when you're asleep. Fantasies are when you're awake. Little boy and a little girl walking down a street, Little boy's beating a tin can and Little girl says - what are you? And he says I'm a drummer. Little girl says : Can I've a f--k? And the boy says: I'm not a real drummer. Are you all right? - Nor. Tell me - how much they pay you? - What? Story. - about twenty cents... why? Pity cos it gave me the sh**s! You had no right to use that stuff! That stuff about ME. My life! Jack! Wasn't fair Nora. Wasn't yours. What do you mean? Events don't belong to people! You act as if they do! Everybody knew who those characters were. - Twenty people in Carlton do not constitute everybody. Doesn't matter how f--g many people. It mattered to me. I did not write that story to get at you! - Nora? No. No what I really hated was beneath all that sisterhood sh-t I had no way of knowing how much you hated me and that hurt. I did it for me. I did it for me for myself! Yeah I bet you did. you're not even a journalist! You just publish your f**king diaries. Just lay off mate ! What's the matter? - Oh he's gone! Can you help me get him outside? Yeah I'll give you a lift. C'mon mate. Javo get up! C'mon. Get up. Sorry Nor. Guess the dope's f-ked me liver. Don't be sorry. People have had to do this for me heaps of times. I guess those country girls find you pretty irresistable ay. Couldnt do any worse than I do round here. - It was a joke. Look I'm aware of all this sh-t you're going through, all this crap with Javo. I suppose I just have to wear my share - feel frustrated. Gerald I'm sorry. I just wish things were simpler. -That wouldn't hurt. Maybe I should spend some time on my own. - Yeah well you're going about that the right way. Have a good tour. NORA: In the weeks that followed I hardly saw Javo at all. Some nights he'd come around and we'd talk for hours about his worn-out friendships and his endless struggle to put his life in shape. And sometimes he'd want to talk about Lillian, Not realising how painful that was. He just didn't see that he held all the cards. Finally I wrote him a letter trying to explain that the arrangement wasn't working and I took it around to Lillian's place. Maybe because I was just curious. I walked right in. Nor ! - Lillian. - How's things? OK.. a bit difficult.. Oh I got your letter. - I got yours too. Must've been the same day. - Must've been thinking about each other the same time. Can you see that gets to Javo? Sure. I'd better go. G'day Nor. (SOBBING) I'm Nora. - This is Annie. Annie. Oh Christ Can I go in for another swim? Doing any more work? - What, more thinly disguised tales of revenge? No, give us a break. I nearly got my windows bricked in after the last one. How you going with Willy? - it's not working out at all. Bloody Angelo's still hanging on I wouldnt even mind that, But I never get to see him. He's always got a rehearsal or a gig, or off to see Angela. I'm not even supposed to ring him up. Nora! - what can I do for you I havent got any. Why don't you ask Martin. He's over there I think Hey Nora. We're on the radio! Turn it up! - What? -Turn it up. NORA: How are things? - Thought you'd been trying to steer clear of me. That note you left me - Lillians place - really cut, you know. Giving you a use is the furthest thing from my mind. Well it seems I only get to see you when you want something And I suppose I got used to you needing me to keep going, And now it feels like I'm watching my kid grow up and take off Which makes me really happy, But its bloody painful you know Sometimes it feels like you don't give a s--t about me, now that you don't need me. Mate. Our relationship's PERMANENT. Maybe we can go out tonight... Anyway knowing you, you'd probably promise to turn up and not show. Who you going with? Gracie. - Ah. Yeah we're going to a movie, not exactly your sort of thing. Anyway I'm off. - Hey. NORA: I thought of how it'd been that summer before. Me in the water, And you - you grinning down at me from below the sign that said Aqua Profonda. And it made me think about all of us, How we thrashed about, swapping and changing partners like a complicated dance, to which the steps hadn't quite been learned. All of us somehow trying to move gracefully in spite of our ignorance./i>
