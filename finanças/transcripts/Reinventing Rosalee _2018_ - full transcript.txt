I'm so happy! Hesitate and you lose. ♪ Oh ♪ And always think what to do next. Narrator: There are certain people in life we consider to be our heroes, those who inspire us to be the best we can be. Sometimes they're celebrities, athletes, world leaders, even adventurers. Sometimes they can be right in front of our own eyes. And there are moments in life that define a person's heroic character. Rosalee Glass was born in 1917 in Warsaw, Poland. I loved my father more than anybody in the world (laughs) and he sang songs to me. That was my name. I was sewing, that was my favorite. So I made shirts for my little brother and my little sister. My business started to grow and at 15, I really sold a lot of shirts around the neighborhood. Then I went into the stores and they loved it. Everybody bought the shirts from me. I had to hire people to work, 10 girls or more. Some made the collar, some made the sleeves. It started to get very popular around the town and my mother said I don't think you should go any further in the business. Now my father took it differently. He says, I believe you can succeed. Narrator: Then, one day Rosalee heard music coming from outside of her window. And it was the same song that her father sang to her as a little girl. And I saw a very handsome man. He looked like a movie star, like Cary Grant. My mother invited him into the house and it was love at first sight. A year later, Abraham asked my father if he can marry me. My father said you're too old for her. So he says, your daughter is very mature for her age and she needs a mature man around her. So my father took it as a good answer and they arranged to make a wedding. Narrator: Rosalee and Abraham set up home in an apartment on Mila Street. The name, Mila in Polish means pleasant. It was the center of Jewish life in Warsaw, Poland. Little did they know that their lives would soon become unpleasant. The Germans and the Russians made a pact with one another, the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact. This pact divided Poland into two parts, the Russian side and the German side. Adolf Hitler was in charge of the German side and Joseph Stalin was in charge of the Russian side. It was impossible to come outside. Then when the bomb they stop, my husband and I went out, we saw six Nazis and all of us and one soldier ran straight over to me and slapped me hard on my face. I was wondering why he did it. He asked, why don't you say thank you? I just looked at him and I didn't say anything. He saw that I don't understand what he's saying, but I really did. My husband didn't respond to fight back, so he let us go. Narrator: Rosalee and Abraham went back to her parents' home and told them they were going to leave Warsaw immediately. I was four months pregnant. My husband made up his mind to go by himself first and make sure that I will go into a house. While he was walking, he looked down and saw a new hat unfamiliar to him. He put it on immediately and he looked like a high-ranking Nazi. He went through the border with a lot of salutes to him. And he saw a man standing there with a horse and buggy, so he went into a house in Bialystok. and gave away his gloves. He said my wife will come and she will pay for everything. Before I left the house, my father said, where are you going? You've never been away from home. I said there's always a first time, we have to go. My father said, I can't leave your mother here. So they started putting everything into knapsacks in case in will be needed to exchange for food. I begged my sister to come with me. She says, I can't come. When you will write me a letter that everything is okay, then I will come. My father insisted that I take my brother with me. Then my father put both hands on my head and said a prayer. Man: May God bless you and protect you. May God make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May God turn his face towards you and grant you peace. And he had tears in his eyes. We were not sure if we will ever see each other. Narrator: Rosalee and her younger brother, Jacob, headed towards the Russian border. And what her eyes saw is something that no eyes should ever see. I saw the Nazis beating people left and right. People were shot from the back, lying dead all over. You had to cross over them because there was no way to walk through otherwise. And I saw an SS man cut off the beards of anybody who had a beard. Horses were ripped and people started to come out and cut off pieces of meat from the horse. There was a man lying in the street shaking like he's going to die. I had a half cup full of water and I put it into his mouth and he opened his eyes. I told him, get up and start walking. One lady carried the baby to an SS man. She thought the SS man was gonna be sympathetic. Instead he took the baby and threw out through the window. There was a long line to go into the border. I had a big sack, it was very heavy. There was a Nazi who beat up another man. He walked back and forth 'til I called him. So he took the stick in his hand, put it on the ground and he stood up and he helped me. He could hardly lift it; he almost fell over. But with all his might, he did it and I went straight to the border. I had to take a chance. The Germans said, you go there, we'll catch you because nobody could walk through the Russian side because there were a lock on the gates. Nothing to eat, nothing to drink. It was raining on everybody. A baby was born under the sky. And with no anything to wrap it around. I had a razor blade in my pocket. I made a hole in the bag and I pulled out a sheet for the baby and helped the mother too. She was naked so I gave her my green shawl to wrap her around. When the baby was born, it was such a panic. And they stormed through at the Russian side. So I saw a man with a horse and buggy and I said to take me to an address. Narrator: Abraham reunited with Rosalee at the farmhouse where he had told her to come. They were so thrilled to see one another. Rosalee thought, now that we are in Russian territory things could only get better. Rosalee: And I had a baby, Eliot. Then one night somebody knocked at the door terribly. It was a Russian soldier, he came in and said, get dressed and come. He took us into an open truck. They told us we are prisoners of war. Narrator: Her son Eliot was born just two weeks earlier. And they didn't know what destination they were being taken. The destination the Glubokovskaya Region in Arkhangelsk, Siberia. When I came to Siberia, we saw a Russian soldier with a rifle. They gave us a little room, the bed with a few boards in it. Right away they put people to work. The job was to find the stems from the trees that were cut off. The stems have to be taken out from the ground so we could plant the potatoes to eat and it was very hard to do it. Because of my husband finding those stems they called him the doctor. Everybody had to stay in line to get a small piece of bread and water from the faucet. That's what we had. The milk in the breasts disappeared. I was so afraid I couldn't nourish the baby. I had a pillow on top of the other pillow and tie it with a string so the baby would be warm. Anything I tried, it didn't work and the baby was crying so hard that I just cried with the baby. And then the baby was quiet. It was used to hunger. He was numb, a little skeleton. I carried the baby, back and forth, like I was a prisoner in my own room. So that's how it was until the baby was many, many, many months alive and then it starved. It died from hunger. That's what happened. As soon as the baby died, they gave me an iron stick to break the ice on the ground. If anybody would move closer, they would be killed. I wasn't dressed right, I didn't have winter clothes. People were dying every day. Who's gonna be next? It was a terrible feeling when they asked that question. One day I said let's talk about living not about dying. Let's make a party. Let's take everybody a piece of bread and put it on the table. Let's make pancakes out of potatoes and we'll drink hot water and we'll imagine it was tea. Everybody had to tell a joke and everybody had to think of positivity. People started clapping hands and put a smile on their faces. A man told me, thank you. Thank you for giving us hope. Once in awhile they make an announcement that we can get parts of the meat from the cow. So I went miles in the horizon and I prayed to God I shouldn't see anybody. It was very dangerous. My husband couldn't go 'cause he was in there with the work. A lung was busted and he got very ill. After I tragically lost the baby, I had another baby, that was Manny. The milk came back into the breast and I nourished the baby in that way. Manny changed my life. Dressed in winter clothes, jacket and boots, beautiful. He solved my problem, being heartbroken. Narrator: Years later, the Russians sent the prisoners from Siberia to another unknown destination. My brother was on the train with me and my husband and the baby. All of the sudden, the train stopped. Two nurses came in and asked who needs medical help. One man said that my brother Jacob needs medical attention. He had a sore foot, so they took him off the train and I didn't hear from him ever since. Narrator: Decades later, it was discovered that Jacob was taken off the train in Inzensky, Russia. He was forced to serve in the Russian Army as a paramedic. While serving there, he was injured and taken to a military hospital near Leningrad in Volkhov. Six months after his release from the hospital in 1942, he was sentenced in Vologda to 10 years hard labor in a prison camp. It's unknown why or what happened to him since. Kazakhstan, the ground was muddy. You had to leave the shoes in the mud and you walk out barefoot. Terrible. I lived in a chicken coop. It was like a shack. To this day, I hate to eat chicken because they were smart. There was a black market, if you had money you could buy food. My husband was a violinist and he didn't know any other trade or how to survive so Abraham became a shoe maker. I went on the black market and I sold a pair of shoes and I could buy a piece of meat from the Cossacks. I had a baby girl in Kazakhstan. She had blonde hair and she was very beautiful. And the baby got sick, she had tuberculosis. There was no doctor to give some medication. It was nothing I could do to help the child survive. The child died. Narrator: After little Perla succumbed to tuberculosis, Rosalee, Abraham and their young son Manny were taken to a displaced persons camp in Feldafing, Germany to wait until they knew which country they would settle in to build a new life. Then my husband was taken away to the hospital in Schloss Elmau because he had tuberculosis. I didn't have money to travel to see my husband, so I started making brassieres. I never did it in my life and I could afford to go to see my husband. When I came to the hospital he was in bad condition. He stayed in the hospital a couple of years and he got one lung removed, so he lived with one lung. One day I was sewing and Manny was playing outside. All of the sudden I didn't see him. I was panicked so I went outside and looked for him. And I couldn't find him. So I went over inside the school and there was Manny. He was four years old and he wanted to be with the other children. Manny took himself to school. Then people registered to go to America. So my husband registered us. We boarded a ship named General Muir. When I came to America, I bended down on my knees and I kissed the ground. We were given three tickets to go to Miami. ♪ The sway of the coconut trees ♪ ♪ The feel of the cool ocean breeze ♪ ♪ No more snow and having to freeze ♪ ♪ As the warm waves hit your knees ♪ ♪ Miami ♪ Rosalee: Everything was so bright and clean. ♪ Miami (singing in foreign language) ♪ ♪ Miami (singing in foreign language) ♪ After what I went through, it was like heaven. I had also a sewing machine I brought with me. The Jewish Family Service helped me financially to pay for rent and food. The first thing I said to my husband, I wanna have a baby. Some places I went to work, they heard me talk and said, oh we can't have you 'cause you don't know how to speak English. So in the evening, I have to a school and get into the life of Americans. Narrator: In addition, Abraham went school and learned a new trade, watchmaking. Rosalee: A year later, I had a beautiful baby girl, Lillian. Narrator: A newspaper in Miami did a story about the new immigrants that came to America, Rosalee, Abraham, and Manny. They called Rosalee and Abraham a radiant couple. They were indeed now that they were living in a free country. Oh baby Lily, God bless her. She was the apple of my eye. She was extraordinary; she was smart. I always bought children's books, so I read it to her and we both learned the language together. Narrator: On a routine doctor's visit for a checkup, they found that Abraham's tuberculosis had returned. He was sent to a sanitarium in Denver, Colorado for treatments spanning three years. Rosalee: They didn't let him up until he was cured. It was very hard for me to be the mother and the father and with small children and not knowing the language and not have help from anybody. That was terrible. Narrator: Even though times were hard for Rosalee, her children gave her joy, especially Manny. Rosalee: Manny was seven years old and we went out for a walk. He noticed a man wanted to cross the street, but he was blind, so he ran over and took the man by hand and crossed over. He was born a gentleman. He did things that I never expected. Narrator: While Abraham was in Denver, he went blind in one eye so as a result, he couldn't work as a watchmaker when he returned home to Miami. Rosalee: I had to go to work and let him stay in the house to take care of the children. Initially, my mom was there constantly. She was a very warm, wonderful presence and suddenly, it was all gone; I never saw her except on the weekends and when I did see her on the weekends, it would be at the beach. But she was always exhausted from working so hard, but she said, you know Lillian, I think of you all the time I'm at work and I love you very much. And that made me feel really good. Narrator: A few years later, Rosalee and Abraham decided to start their own business together so she could spend more time with the family. I loved working with my husband in the drapery business because any decision we made was together. I loved watching my children grow. Narrator: Rosalee and Abraham had a great life together and lived in their retirement community for 15 years. Until Abraham passed away. Rosalee: When he died it's like taking away an arm from me. Narrator: Abraham's grave reads that he was born in 1910, but he was really born in 1906. He and many other immigrants during that time, wrote younger ages on their immigration documents. This was often done in order to avoid further prejudice due to ageism. Rosalee: He hoped to stay with me forever and he did. He had kidney problems, liver problems, all kinds of health problems and yet, he lived to be 90. Why? Love, I'm convinced it was because he loved Mom so much he didn't wanna die. Abraham don't send me a visa. I've got a lot of things to do yet. Narrator: Rosalee tried to manage on her own. She joined various activities and went to exercise classes. Then suddenly, tragedy struck her beloved son, Manny. Rosalee: There was a young doctor, seven months a doctor. He made mistakes; he put something into his throat and he choked on it. He became a vegetable and he died. It was the worst day of my life. As soon as Manny died, I brought Rosalee to New York to stay with me. It was one of the worst experiences that we ever went through. My mom was a broken woman. She couldn't eat. I tried to take her to the best restaurants, didn't matter. She wouldn't touch her food. I tried to take her to the theater to entertain her. She would fall asleep. She'd walk around in a daze. She really couldn't function. She would wake up in terror; she would scream. She would cry; she would wail. The depression was so, so severe. I'd never seen her like that before. Life had no meaning for me; I wanted to die. Narrator: Then one day, it was as though a miracle happened. Rosalee woke up one morning and said to her daughter, Abraham's gone, Manny's gone and now I'm going to live my life to the fullest. Rosalee: And I did it! Narrator: So in her late 80s, she started doing things she never did before. She took piano lessons, Tai chi, dancing and tango lessons, pool exercise, and boxing lessons. She even took an acting class. The teacher called me up and said, your mother is fabulous; she's a natural at this. You've gotta do something with it and we did. When Lillian was 10 years old, she sent me a birthday card where it says, when I grow up, I'll take you around the world and she did. Wherever I went in the world, I loved to see animals. I loved when a penguin was chasing after me. Lillian: I think you're gonna win turtle (laughs). Okay Rosalee, you won then. Mom, you look so cute. I can read (laughs). Lillian: So what do you think of your new style? I think it's marvelous. Lillian: Your turn. Lillian: Oh my God! ♪ It's impossible ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ Ask a baby not to cry ♪ ♪ I'm not crying ♪ ♪ It's just impossible ♪ - ♪ Can I hold you closer ♪ - Yes. ♪ Amore ♪ Isn't it wonderful? Rosalee: We went on a tour. The tour guide told us to wait 20 minutes for him. I saw him go close to the gate and we followed him and when I came over to the gate, the guards opened the gate for me and we started walking and there were over a million people over there. A lady came over to us, volunteered. She made everybody move out of the way and let me through. We went so far until we came to a gate where it was forbidden for anybody to go through. And then after finish the coronation, the Pope went in the pope mobile. And he went through the aisle where I was standing and he looked at me and blessed me. I have tears in my eyes, because it was not to be believed. And then a whole line of priests went by and shook my hand and smiled at me and talking to me. Lillian: Say something. Yeah. And I felt healed after what happened in World War II. It recalls reminds me. Lillian: It recalls what? - It reminds me of something. - Yeah? Narrator: Joseph Stalin was the reason that Rosalee was sent to prison camp in Siberia. 65 years later, she indulged in pastries, drank wine, played pool in his billiards room, and even had the opportunity to urinate in his private toilet, which made her giggle. Then they went back to Warsaw, Poland where it all began. I'm very happy to go to the places where we have to go-- Lillian: That's right, to pay our respects, huh? To pay our respects to everyone with the flowers. Lillian: Yes. Wow, what a taste of reality, Mom. You don't look at life the same after this. So what we did here is we buried Mom's family. We gave them an honorable burial, a burial that they didn't have, with dignity. We gave it to them with dignity. And then we took xeroxed pictures and put them in the grave. Today, right now, we're going to pay our respects before we leave. Rosalee: Yes. Lillian: Right here, right here. It's a place we'd put it on the grave. Amen. It's beautiful. I'm sure they heard you, their spirit heard you. It's beautiful, that was so beautiful, - so touching. - Thank you. Lillian: Is this hard for you Mom? It's not easy, but I have a lot I'm doing yet. Lillian: That's where, oh I see it. There it is, Mom. Oh look at it, oh I see it, yeah, yeah. Roslee: It's also there. Lillian: It's like, this is for you Mom. This is a monument for you. Isn't that incredible? You are a miracle, Mom. So are you. Lillian: You're a gift from God and I cherish you, you know? Thank you and I cherish you. I feel relieved; I feel that we closed up all work we had to do. Narrator: Perhaps the most moving experience for Rosalee was knowing that her daughter's internationally bestselling book, Toxic People, was translated and published in Poland. Rosalee: I said, we are here in Poland and you've got your book here? I couldn't believe it. Talk Show Host: My next guest wrote a book entitled Toxic People, 10 Ways of Dealing with People Who Make Your Life Miserable. Meet Dr. Lillian Glass. Thank you. Host: Recognized as the country's foremost authority on speech and communication skills, she's coached many celebrities and politicians, she is Dr. Lillian Glass. - And she's just fantastic. - Please. You know, Dr. Glass deserves an award, maybe an Academy Award. Her books changed people's lives. It made my life worthwhile. And we've also invited Dr. Lillian Glass, who specializes in communication. Whenever I see her on television I smile. I'm her biggest fan. Having a daughter like Lillian is a dream come true. Phil: Let's welcome Dr. Glass to the show. I met an Indian man and he said that Lillian is worth more than 10 daughters and it is so true. I very honored an privileged to introduce Dr. Lillian Glass. Rosalee: I survived so Lillian could help the world. Thank you so much for your graciousness and I appreciate everything and there's Rosalee Glass right there. Narrator: After traveling the world which helped heal Rosalee emotionally, in her 90s her acting career really took off. As a result I got an agent and start doing commercials. My favorite commercial was seen at the Super Bowl. Announcer: To the metal! You hesitate and you lose! Announcer: Never forget where you came from. Oh my gosh, there was Rosalee on a Super Bowl commercial. I was screaming. Narrator: When Lillian was younger, Rosalee entered her in a beauty pageant. Then at 94 years old, Lillian decided to enter Rosalee into a senior beauty pageant. Announcer: Rose has been active in the television commercial industry. She owned her own interior decorator and drapery manufacturing business. Ladies and gentlemen, Rose Glass, contestant number two. My philosophy of life is to be compassionate, having sensitive feelings towards others, having a positive attitude, giving smiles to everyone you meet, and always think what to do next. Announcer: Rose is singing an American prayer, God Bless America, acapella. ♪ God bless America ♪ ♪ My home sweet home. ♪ Narrator: During the judge's interview competition, she was asked, of all people whether living or not, who would you like to have dinner with? And her reply was Matt Damon. Announcer: Rose Glass, come on Rosie. Ms. Congeniality is going to Rose Glass. When my mom won Ms.Congeniality I was trying to take pictures and video tape it, but I couldn't see anything because tears were just dripping down my eyes. I was so proud like any parent would be so proud. It was Ms.Congeniality, showed her inner beauty not just the outside beauty and that's what she's taught me all my life, that it's what's inside that counts. We had the great pleasure of going to see Rosalee compete and she was easily one of the most beautiful women there, because that's who Rosalee is. She always has a kind word; she always smiles. She makes you happy. This is a person that is funny and a giving person and again, that's part of the magic that she brings. I think we all should know somebody like Rosalee so we have something to aspired to. Joyce: She is an inspiration to anyone that she meets. I've never seen her without a smile that lights up the world and that is the truth. Rosalee: No, no. Lillian: Mom, now that you've finished eating, I have surprise for you. What is it? Lillian: Close your eyes. Okay, now look down. Look at your plate. (laughs) Rosalee Glass, 100 Years of Wisdom to Guide You Through Life's Ups and Downs. Lillian: Congratulations. Thank you. Lillian: You're an author. Beautiful (laughs). I really love it. One day my mom was wearing some tight shoes and I said, Mom, you're never happy unless your feet are happy and she said you know, I say that. And I go, of course you say that. That's your saying. I have all your sayings, in fact you have about 100 sayings and I've memorized all of them. She says, do you know what I'd like to do, I'd like to share that with people. Maybe I should write a book with all these sayings and we should share that with the public. And I said, done, let's do it. So Mom, now that you're 100, what do you want for your 100th birthday? I would like three things. Lillian: Okay, what are the three things? First, I would like a little party with people that I really like. What's your secret to keep your long life? A long life is being, having love in your heart and feeling it and doing the best you can for anybody who needs help. Lillian: Beautiful, beautiful. Rosalee, so you're still in such great shape. - You're beautiful. - Thank you. How do you stay in great shape? Because I'm using Pilates. Man: Pilates, nice. Pilates is one of the best exercises I have ever had. I love this machine. It helps my back. This is somebody that's very exceptional because she never said no to activity and she is very energetic and that is paying massive dividends now. It works out on all parts of your body and you can feel it in your arms, in your muscles. Your posture is becoming beautiful. Rosalee is so fit, not just fit, she is sexy. She could be a playmate, seriously she could. Rosalee, I've known you a long time. You never ever age. How do you stay so beautiful? I always look for the quality of makeup, 'cause makeup makes you look younger and you feel it. Your father sang a song to you when you were a little girl and for your birthday, I learned that song. And I learned it in Yiddish. So, I'm gonna sing it to you. - Okay? - Yeah. Oh my! Ready, okay, all right. Okay, wait a second. Thank you. Guest: That was really good. Thank you. I have another present. Miamon Miller, the top violin player. He's gonna play Reisela for you. Look, go ahead, here you go. Thank you Miamon. - Happy Birthday. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Wow. - It was beautiful. Lillian: Mom, what's your second wish? I wanna start a new business. Lillian: So you're gonna start a new business? Yes, to give people advice over the internet. Lillian: You know what, nobody could do it better than you. Thank you. Lillian: I mean you helped me millions of times. Thank you. Lillian: I'm excited about this. Well that makes me happy. Oh beautiful. So this is the homepage where we have a lovely picture of you. We also created her bio page where we have a nice little bio. And she also offers an advice-giving service at age 100. You can go to her website, go to her advice form, fill it out and you'll receive a reply back. This is awesome. I recall once when I had a problem and she told me, remain true to yourself and it really helped me through that time because it was a very difficult time for me. And I'm very grateful for that. And to top everything off, we also have a Facebook and Twitter page. Very few 100 girls have a Twitter page. - I mean it's perfect. - I couldn't be happier. An elegant website for an elegant lady. I really appreciate, I really do. Man: Oh my pleasure, my pleasure. Lillian: So what's your third wish for your 100th birthday? To go to Alaska to ride on the sled dogs-- - What? - With the sled dogs. Lillian: Are you kidding me? (laughs) No. Lillian: Are you serious? Yes I am serious. Lillian: To ride with the sled dogs? - Yes! - But Mom, you're 100! You can't be in the cold riding with the sled dogs. But I feel like I am 50. Lillian: But Mom, look at what happened to Buzz Aldrin. - Do you know Buzz Aldrin? - Yes. - He's the astronaut. - He's the astronaut. I'm gonna show you, let me get my iPhone. I wanna show you what happened. Here, look at this; read what it says. It says Buzz Aldrin almost died. I know what happened to him. - He didn't dress right. - He didn't dress right? The clothes he was wearing was too light. He should wear heavier clothes. Lillian: All right, you know what? I think the best thing we can do is talk to Dr. Huizenga, so if he says you can go, you can go. If he says you can't go, you can't go. Okay, I agree. Lillian: I really don't feel good about you going to Alaska, I just don't feel right. If Dr. Huizenga says not to go, then he sees a reason for it and I will not go. I will not jeopardize my life. Nancy: You're one of my best patients. You look so cute. So do you. Nancy: Aw, thank you honey, thank you, thank you. And we'll go here, straighten that. I've seen, Rosalee? I've seen a lot more knee problems on 30 year old Raiders than I see on you. This is a good knee. Look it, your heel touches your butt. That's like an 18 year old schoolgirl. And then you can straighten your knee, that's good. And we're just gonna make sure it's in one piece, so we try to go sideways and then we pull it this way. Okay, Dr. Huizenga, I'm going on a dog sled, but I'll be dressed right. Well I'm worried about some of the gold miners when they see you. You know, I'm worried about their hearts. I don't think so because I will watch myself. Well, I'll tell you, my only advice to you is to do what you've done your whole life, just be yourself and be successful and you'll have the time of your life. - Okay, thank you. - Okay. The average age is 85, plus or minus 10 years, so when you're outside that range, you're a very exceptional human being and I attribute a lot of her longevity just to this. She has the will to live and a great body, but the brains I think have kinda kept everything together. I wish I was related to her, because I'd like a little of that myself. You're my hero, okay. Go out and win for me okay? All right, gimme a big hug. I'm really getting excited. Lillian: So what do you think about being here in this cold, 76 years later? It's a reminder of Siberia (laughs) that I went through. Now I feel better, like day and night. Lillian: Do you wish you had these clothes in Siberia? Oh that would be great! Lillian: Tell me what you think about all these colors. I think of colors, life. Life is built on colors. Wherever you go and see colors, you think of life. You think of beauty. You can imagine clothes, shoes, anything you want in life is related with colors. Lillian: You said you wanted to be colorful and you wanted to be warm, right? - Oh your hands are cold. - That's right. Guess what? Look what I found. Do you wanna wear this? Ah, yeah. Lillian: Do you wanna wear it now or later? Later. Annabella do you wanna wear it, huh? Oh she's gonna wear it. Mom, look how cute she looks, is she adorable or what? - Yeah. - Look at this, look! Yes, yes, yes. Stunning, stunning. Annabella, you could wear your little hat and they'll think you're a sled dog. (laughs) You're so cute. So Mom are you getting excited? Rosalee: Yeah, very much. This is gonna be great and today is your birthday. Today is my birthday. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Rosalee ♪ ♪ Happy 100th birthday to you ♪ Thank you so much. You mean the world to me, you know. Same here. You know it's interesting because you know I always wanted children and then I'd get involved with some guy that he didn't wanna have children or he had grown children or he was non-committal. So then remember when I was trying to adopt that Chinese baby? Rosalee: Yes. Yeah and then they closed the acceptance of single women to adopt Chinese babies and then that didn't happen, but you know what, I got something even better. I got to be your stage mother (laughs) your mother. I feel that you are my mother now. You used to be my daughter and now you are my mother. It's true, it's true, I feel like your mother. Well what kind of mother am I? The best mother. Well you know, I tell you something, Mom, I really wanted to give you the life that you never had because I know when you were in Poland, when you were kidnapped to Siberia and you had that hell of a life, it was horrible, living hell. You've seen the most toxic of human beings, - of human kind. - Yes, I did. And yet you're so beautiful and so warm and loving. Why is that? 'Cause most people would say, I hate the Germans because of what happened and you don't feel that way. No, I don't. I don't have prejudice in me. I don't have hate in me. To me, every person is the same. I love you. I love you too. And you should have a long, happy life. Lillian: And you too, Mom. Thank you. There's a lot more to be done. I don't think there are words to describe how I feel about my mother. She's amazing. Dignity, intelligence, warmth, love. She has no prejudice, no hate. She's the most incredible human being I've ever met. I'm blessed; I'm truly blessed. I cherish every moment with her and I'm honored. I'm honored that she's my mother. Lillian: Duck feet, duck feet, duck feet. One more duck foot. Okay, I've got you. Thank God, thank God I can. I got you Mom. Let's go! I got you. Rosalee, what do you think? Are you okay? How do you feel? Rosalee: Wonderful. Lillian: Do you love it? Rosalee: Yes. Narrator: When the dog sled ride was over, she wanted to do it again. But this time she wanted to do it with a real professional, a champion dog musher. Lillian: So Mom, are you getting excited?
