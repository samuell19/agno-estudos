What's gotten into you? Are you mad? What are you doing? Can't you see? I am drawing. - At 3 am? - I can't sleep. Turn off the light and come to bed. We have to get up early to take the kids to the dressmaker. Oh no! Please... Hello, ma'am. Hello, sir. Henri Serin, salesman from Godineau. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. - You've been here for a long time? - No, barely a month. I was looking at your store from the outside. It is a true gem. - My husband decorated it. - You'll give him my compliments. You know the work from Godineau? Of course, such an old company! The oldest! We celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. We have not had the opportunity to work you yet. We usually work with Jaulin. - Jaulin-Dumont? They do fine work. - We are old customers. I'm their daughter's godmother. Oh, really? Would you like to see our collection? Yes, go ahead. Since you already know Godineau, you won't learn anything new. You know our motto: quality, solidity, waterproofness. This year our company has made big efforts on the models and their colors. We renewed the whole collection without increasing the prices. Isn't it appreciable. We have the 8-rib #48, the 10-rib #56, #60 has 8 ribs, or 10 for the ladies. And the famous #63 that you certainly know. 8 or 10 ribs, our flagship product.

Thai umbrellas, and... umbrella for ecclesiastics, standard models, We use standard measures in a wide range of fashioned colors. Java handle, covered with leather, a classic. Black plastic cherry wood, exotic wood, bamboo, fake bamboo... And our entire collection of country-style umbrellas, of which you can admire the bright colors. You missed her for 10 minutes. She went to her hairdresser. I can't decide alone. She fills the order forms. I understand. Come back tomorrow morning, my wife will be here. - Very well. At what time do you open? - At 9 o'clock. Well, I will be back tomorrow then. - I'm sorry. - No, no. It's okay. - Goodbye Sir. - Goodbye. Mister... Serin. Like the bird! Well... Excuse me. - I'll put you in the back, as usual. - Yes, near the garden. Leave your luggage here. The concierge will bring it to your room. You can go directly to the dining room. Dining time is 15 minutes earlier now. To let some customers watch TV. Good evening. Good evening. - How are you doing? - Very well. And yourself? - Fine. - So you're in this area? - Yes, for another two or three days. We have sautéed rabbit. I'll take menu #11. I'll start with a beetroot salad. - Any drink? - One quarter of red wine. Oh! Mr. Serin! - What a surprise! - Hello, Ms. Licois. - You're lucky, I was about to close. - Really? Guess what I brought you. - You did it? - A promise is a promise. Oh, you're so nice! I thought you were joking when you told me that. I wasn't. - That is so beautiful! - You like it? The colors are great. You are so talented! It's belongs to you know. It's a gift. I'm spoiled! You make me look like a young girl. I did nothing. It's just you! You sure know how to talk to women. When I think you have to do this job! While you have golden hands. Life is really weirdly made. - I was telling my husband... - Is he not here? No, he's in Nantes. He went to see his sister to hospital. He'll be here tomorrow. I'll hang it in the living room. It will be so chic! Be careful, it's not completely dry. You are too kind. Here, let me give you a kiss. - You have three TV channels? - No, only two. Look at it, above the sideboard. It's so great. It looks like a Matisse. It is magnificent. Oh... Mr. Henri, I almost made a mistake. That's my goal. You are so teasing! Your husband better watch out. If only he knew what I was holding right now... Mr Henri, be reasonable. I have a plum brandy. Tell me how you like it, it's great. Since the start of our dinner, I have this idea in my head. But I don't really dare asking you. Say it. It's a dream I've always had... What is it? I would like to pose for you, Mr. Henri. How so? Naked or in my underwear, as you prefer. I've always dreamed of being a model. It must be amazing to present new designs. Well! Well! This is very nice. Isn't it? Ms. Licois still has it. I think so, yes. Don't move. No, keep this position. I'm intimidated. I am before the master's eye. This isn't very aesthetic. Lower your panties. Like this? A bit more. Turn around in my direction. Oh, Mr. Henry! I can't take it anymore! I need to calm down! Mr. Henri... What's wrong, little girl? Mr. Henri! Oh, Mr. Henri! Oh! You are crazy! What's gotten into you? Mr. Henri! Don't move. So, things are not going well with your wife? How am I supposed to get along with that bitch? She's a Catholic, a bigot. She's a turd. Poor Monsieur Henri. A man like you, so kind. And so talented. What a waste. I only stay for the kids. How are they? Like their mother. He, he's a little Nazi. And the girl thinks I'm a fool. So you don't feel comfortable at home. I only feel well when I travel. And yet... But tonight... I'm good. That's very nice of you. I ruined my whole life for these three assholes. Don't say that. I have to say, when I saw your wife for the 1st time I thought you two were mismatched. A woman so cold, so rude, with a man like you, so warm. If you could see that bitch. She doesn't even know what a dick is. - Mr. Henri! - It's the truth. You, you smell of piss, not holy water. Mr. Henri, your way of talking... Mr. Henri... Mr. Henri... Mr. Henri... Oh no! Not there! No, Mr. Henry. No, allow me. Let me. Let me live, let me breathe. God! I'm suffocating! - Henri... - Oh, you're so hot! Oh, you smell so good. You smell so good! Ah, you're hot! You're so hot! God damn it! Oh holy fucking shit! - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Serin. - Where are you going? - To Redon. Redon? Come on, get in. You are a Godsend. - God will reward you, for sure. - I doubt it. He recognizes His fellows with this kind of free act. Ordinary things from each day. - I never believed in that shit. - don't despair. It's not too late. The ways of the Almighty are wondrous. - What a beautiful day, isn't it? - Yeah... The sunlight on the brooms! Another blessing from our Lord. - 49? You are from Maine-et-Loire? - Yes, Saumur. Ah! Saumur! The abbey of Saint-Maur, the banks of the Loire... "My little Liré more than Mont Palatin" "And the sea air over the sweetness of Anjou" Yesterday I was on a pilgrimage in Notre-Dame-de-Béhuard. - Béhuard? You know that godforsaken hole? - I do. I used to go there with my boss when I was a kid. What a farce! So many foolishnesses we did in Béhuard! - Do you know Brittany? - You bet I do! I could cross that land blindfolded. I'm a commercial traveler! I knew it! I don't know why, I knew you were a man of the roads. - Just like me. - Really? - What do you do? - I'm a door-to-door salesman. I'm permanently connected to the Lord and I go from one pilgrimage to another to spread His words. Come on, stop that bullshit. The angels from heaven have departed. And the time is coming when the celestial legions will strike the false angels. Why are you laughing? Because you rock, buddy! You need to see a doctor! You shouldn't laugh. You're one of God's chosen ones. You just don't know it. You will come to Christ, I am sure of it. The right time... just has not come yet. Bonum vinum laetificat cor hominis. Here is for you. It's here. The first house on the left. I live with my sister. Don't be surprised, she is a little strange, but she isn't a bad woman. What were you doing? I waited for one hour but in the end I dined alone. Also this is Thursday, day of your injection. Sister St. Jean-de-Dieu looked for you. This gentleman invited me to dinner. Mr. Serin is a commercial traveler. He drove me here from Vannes. He was about to stay at the hotel, I told him he could sleep here. Please come in. I don't mean to intrude, Madam, but your brother was very insistent. Isn't hospitality one of the main demonstration of Christian charity? Please come in. Just make sure you use the overshoes. I've saved some rice cake. Thank you but I'm fine. Mr. Serin... I'm fine, thank you. I thought we could give him Mom's room. You know I've not prepared it! What about the covers? I'll help you to carry your luggage? You can remove your coat. You will be fine here. It isn't very comfortable, but there is a good bed. Well, I leave you. I won't see you tomorrow, I'll leave very early. All right. If you ever come back to Redon come say hello. We'll have a talk. So many things separate us spiritually. - Thank you again. Good night. - No, thank you. Good night. If you need anything, our room is down the hall. Thank you, ma'am. Good night, ma'am. She's crazy! Shit! I just crushed a guy. Shit! What is this? Oh no, no, no! The fucker! Good evening, gentlemen. I'm sorry to disturb you, I just had an accident on the road. Could you tell me how far is the next village? Is the next village very far? Throw him out. What?! What's wrong with you? Leave me alone! I need your help. I ran over a boar. Enough. We have never seen a boar around here. How is that? Look at this! My hands are full of blood. Look a the hair. So? Is there a garage around here? You lunatics! At first glance, it doesn't look good. If the front axle took a hit, it will need a lot of work. Maybe a longeron got damaged. I will need the parts to be shipped from Quimper. Is there anything you need in the car? - Where can I wash my hands? - There is a sink behind. I'll take it inside and elevate it. Give me a beer please. Fuck! Come on Naik, another round. Excuse me Sir, do you know a hotel nearby not too expensive but with good food? - There is the Coq Hardi. - Yes, in the square near the Church. Or Guérec pension, on the way out of the village, - On the road to Pont-Aven. - Thank you. - You are passing through? - No. I had an accident earlier. Where? Five kilometers from here, on the road to Quimperlé. - An accident... Something serious? - No. Only car damage. I ran over a wild boar. A boar? You mean a badger. No, no. It was a wild boar. I thought there were no boars in this region. Sometimes they come from the forest. So I got towed and I'll have to sleep here. Go to Ms. Guérec then, that's your best option. - Or go to Pont-Aven, 4 km from here. - No. - Do you live nearby? - No. I'm a traveling salesman. You sell goods for painters? I sell umbrellas. This portrait is for a client. - But you can also paint. - Just a bit. I'm an amateur. Let's shake hands. I am a painter too. But a professional. Can I see it? Well, if you want. - But it isn't finished yet. - It does not matter. Ah. Strong job. I need to polish a few things. It isn't finished yet. - I am not satisfied with the hands. - No. They are botched. Don't bother, you can sleep at my place. - I don't want to intrude. - No! We are colleagues, aren't we? And don't be so formal. My name's Emile. You'll see, I have a great house along the river. It cost me 250 grands. Not a thing the little scribblers in Pont-Aven can afford, trust me. - Do you do exhibitions sometimes? - Are you kidding me? Why should I care? I gave up making art a long time ago. I work for dough. I don't admire my ego every morning pretending I'm a genius. I work for summer vacationers and tourists. Sometimes I decorate an inn. You'll see, I do great things. I paint 5 meters by 3 panels. It's impressive. It's almost frescoes. See, here it is. I did everything myself. The foundations, everything. There is a terrace, facing South, all to way to the river. Only for the thatch did I call a professional. This is my place. What do you think of it? Yeah, it's a fine place. It is the work of my life. Kitty! Kitty! Where is she? Kitty! Ah, there you are. Here is a friend of mine. Coming from Loire. Hello! Hello, miss. I'm so tired. I just finished half an hour of exercise. That's the workshop. The first floor isn't done yet, I'm trying to finish it. Sit down, gentlemen. - You wish you could fuck her! - Well, yeah. - She's hot, isn't she. - Well... Yeah! She's very pretty. The eye of a painter! - Is she Swiss? - No. She is Canadian. She's been here for a month. Please excuse me, I'll right back. I have an emergency. No! Get off me! Get off me! Leave me alone. No! No! No! Let me go. Let me go. No! Leave me alone. No. No! You're disgusting, really! You're disgusting. When I see her butt-naked, I can't control it, I have to fuck her. I like it rough. - What do you want to drink? - Whatever... What do you have? Everything! What about a whiskey? If you want. Take off your coat, you look like a dumbass! Have a seat. You're a friend of Emile? - It's funny, I've never seen you before. - Of course not! We've just met He had an car accident yesterday. - Anything serious? - No, no. A trivial matter. His car won't be fixed before tomorrow. So I told him to come here. You did right. See? That's what I do. Yes, I see. It's nice. - You think so? - Yes, it's nice. You're a true friend. You can bang her. Why the whispers? Nothing, sweetheart. He's a painter, too. - Really? - I'm just an amateur. - I saw his work. He is a champion. - Can I see? Yes, he will show you later. Do you know Karchlisky? - Of course he doesn't know Karchlisky! - Who is that? Karchlisky? He's an imposter. A kike ho thinks he's Soutine. Don't you dare! I forbid you to talk ill of him. He is very talented. Sure, "talented". Come with me, I'll show you what he does. Indistinct. You sleep well. Can you spare some space? don't be afraid. He told me to come here. Yes, I swear! Come on, make room.. - Is that me? - Yes. - Wow, you draw a nice ass! - That's yours. Yes, it is beautiful. You did a fine job. So he told you to come? Yes. He needs that to fuck me. - Really? That man is insane, isn't he? - Yeah. He always wants me to get fucked by his friends. Sometimes it's a chore. - And you always accept? - No. Usually I don't. But with you, it's not the same. You, you look nice. You're hot. You're boiling. - Aren't you a bit messed up too? - Why? It's weird that you ended up here. But... Why do you stay with him? I don't know. It's just like that. How? - How can it just happen? - Kiss me again. You do that well, too. What is it? - It's him. I must go back. - Why? This is the signal he gave me to come back. - No, stay there. - Don't be silly. But why? Why would you go with that faggot? No, let me go, seriously. I must go back. See? Did you have fun, horny? - Huh? - What do you mean? Well, what? It sounded like bullfight last night. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't too bad. Thank you. When women act like sluts, it's worth everything. I think I hit the jackpot. She has a great ass, but she is crazy.. Sex! That's the only thing that truly matters, artist! I'll drop you at the garage. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Your car won't be fixed before 15 days. Why don't you stay here? You could use my workshop and paint whenever you want. Sell your paintings to the freaks who come here. With the talent you have you'll get rich quickly. I know, but... You know... Don't tell me your family is stopping you. You say yourself they are assholes. You send them a note, you tell them: "Expensive shit is over." "I'll send you that much each month. If you don't like it, suck it." Look at Gauguin. He ditched all of them. Don't you think it's better to live with this. Look at that butt crack! It's more beautiful than the face of the Virgin Mary, isn't it? Okay, let's go. - Where are you going? - To visit Goulven in Rosbras. I want to show him the room that I decorated. - Can I go with you? - No, no. It's just a fast trip. Let's go. What a pain! She always wants to stick to my ass! I can't stand that guy anymore. He makes me sick. When he comes back, he will want to make love to me. - Take me away. - Where do you want me to take you? I don't know. But it is like hell here. I can't stand it anymore when he touches me. I don't want you to leave and to go home. No, but... What would you like? I know a place where we could be happy. Where? In a village by the seaside. A small inn. You could paint. You're a good painter. You have a lot of talent. That's really nice of you. People never talk to me like this. At home, my wife, my daughter, my son... Godineau and everybody, all they do is stifle me. It's true. No, don't think about it anymore. This is all over now. You think so? That's him. Don't move. - I must go. - Don't move. - What are you gonna do? - Wreck him. - Be careful, he's mean. - I can crush that pygmy with a finger. Kitty! Kitty! Don't move. Hey, lovebirds! Enjoying it? Enjoying it so much that you're forgetting your friend Emile. It's not very nice of you to act like this. Come on Darling, come here. Why don't you come and get her? Am I dreaming? What's going on? Are you in love, the two of you? Look at this, it's so moving! Don't tell me the sales rep fell in love with the whore. This slut, this cock garage. Damn you, dirty dog. - Come back now. - No! No? All right. We will use strong-arm tactics. Careful, he will take his gun! You're not laughing anymore, huh? You, the sales rep, you gather your things, now. And cover your ass. And hit the road. And you, you go back up there. He scared me, you know. We can expect anything from this kind of madman. - He might have shot. - Not at all. Look, it's not even loaded! Feel how fast my heart is beating. I was afraid. - What do we do now? - I don't know. You told me you knew a place. - That's what you want? - Well, yes! I love you! Hurry up. Take your things and let's go. I don't want to hit him again. Go get dressed. We'll take his car. How far is it from here? Approximately 20 kilometers. You'll see, it's very pretty. It's a small fishing port on the Aven. The sea is always so beautiful! And you too, you're beautiful. Wonderfully beautiful. How could I live without you? You see, in my earlier life, with my wife and all that, it was like a nightmare. But now... It's like a dream. I've been waiting for this for so long! I will paint. Oh yes, I'll paint! I'll paint like a madman. Your eyes, your mouth, your forehead... Your body. Your thighs. Your ass. Oh yes, your ass, especially! Show it to me. Come on, show it to me. Show it to me. Arch your back! Push it toward me. How beautiful it is! It looks like a Courbet, I must say. You need to be a genius to be able to paint it. That guy painted thousands of them and was charged with obscenity. Yet he painted the most beautiful thing in the world: an ass! A woman's ass. It is so beautiful. I'll paint it in green. In blue, in red, in yellow... I will spend days, nights, months on it, if I have to. Holy fucking crazy shit! You make me crazy. You make me crazy. I'm crazy. Let me grab it. Your ass! Your ass! This is my genius. You're so beautiful, dammit. Don't move, stay still. No, stop that. I've never been so happy. Are you happy too? I'd like to take you to my country. Quebec is beautiful. Take me wherever you want. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. Bye! Angela! Angela? Angela? - Have you seen Angela? - No, Mr. Henri. The last time I saw her, she was with you for lunch I haven't seen her since. - She isn't in our room. - She must be in the village. Her belongings are not there. Anybody came to get her? Not that I've seen. Angela! Angela! Angela! Ida! Have you seen Angela? - Yes, Mr. Henry. - When? - About an hour ago. - Where? She went in your car with some man. What was he like? Small, and kinda chubby. Oh my God. - She isn't at the inn? - No. - Thank you. - Good evening, Mr. Henri. - Are you going to Riec? - Yes. - Can you take me there? - Sure. Can you go a bit faster? Sure thing. - Are you here on holidays? - No, no. This region is really beautiful. Are you from this region? I'm looking for a good creperie. Do you know one? Do you feel unwell? Are you ill? I can take you to a pharmacy, if you want. No. Drop me there. - Do you need some help? - No. How much do I owe you? Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela, open up! Angela! Angela, answer me! Ang... Angela! Henri? Hi, Henri! Henri Serin, sales rep for Godineau. How are you doing? Hey Henri, how are your umbrellas? Quality, strength, waterproofness. I'll have a 10-rib #56. Henri, don't you have a 8-rib #48? # 48-8, #48-10, # 60-8, #60-10. Umbrellas with invisible ribs. Java handle covered with leather, black plastic, cherry wood, exotic wood... Godineau, umbrellas for ecclesiastics. The Thai umbrella. Henri, your beret! The beret... is the painter's umbrella. ♪ A small corner under the umbrella ♪ ♪ Against a corner in paradise ♪ ♪ She had something of an angel ♪ - They are all bitches, Paulo. - All? Yes, all of them. Except for the small one. She was a lily. A dove. Henry, you're sad today. Sing us one more little song. Les Fraises de Plougastel! Are you kidding me? I've been your buffoon for 3 weeks already! I'd rather be a beggar. I'm not Théodore Botrel, I Henri Serin. Like the bird. Henri, guess who I saw last night in Concarneau. My wife and her chimpanzee? Your dove. She looked like she had taken a hit. She took a room with a guy, in the Hotel du Port. - What did you just say? - I said I saw Angela yesterday. Take your words back. Are you crazy? What's gotten into you? - I said take your words back. - Let go of me. You're going crazy. Let go of me! Fuck! Don't stop me. - Forget it. - I'm gonna kick this bastard's ass! - Henri, forget it. Go to bed. - Why is he saying bullshit? - You did not see that. - I didn't dream. Yesterday, at 9 PM. You did not see that. How do you know Angela? What can you say about her? I'm the only one here who knows Angela. I was there when she slept with me. You weren't! - Henri, enough. - Angela isn't a whore! I know her better than you! It is I who fucked her ass, you didn't! - I know her better than you. - He's just kidding you. I'll fuck you, bastard! Angela is a white goose. - She is a white goose. - Yes, she's a white goose. She is a white goose. - Angela is a white goose, motherfucker! - Go home now! Damn wind. No! Her ass was not like this, god damn it! But I have it right here. I have it, dammit! - Hi Henri. - Hi. It's been a week since we last saw you. - What will you have? - Red wine. My mother said she saw you in Petit-Kariou this morning. - You're painting again? - Yeah... Have you heard? Emile and Angela. It seems they have been here since last week. Le Goff, the fishmonger, saw them yesterday in Riec. I wouldn't tell you if it wasn't true. What's gotten into you? Beautiful! What's this? Who is that fool? Oh, it's the sales rep! Hey! Come in! Come in! Who's that guy? You don't know Henri? He's a salesman. It's that fool who messed this place. Henri! Come in! Come have a little whiskey with your friend, Henri! Come on, put your ass here. So you're still in the region? I thought you had gone back to your home. You came to get the little whore? She went back to her godforsaken place long ago. She was a slut. I never hid it to you. Everything in her boobs, nothing in her head! Henri... Aren't they cute, the two of them? Look at that! What a slut. Go ahead, what are you waiting for? Come on, go ahead! - What's wrong with him? - He's too drunk! Come on, get up. Are you selling lino now? Get up! He's going to puke everywhere. He will puke on my tiles. Hey, help me! The moron is heavy. One! Two! And three! There he is. Hey! Come here chubby! Come here, come! You're ugly, but I'm going to fuck you anyway. Good afternoon. Did you sleep well? You drank too much last night, again! You are not reasonable. You know it hurts you. You don't even finish your paintings these days. Hi Marie. Why did Angela leave? I'm such a loser. - What are you saying? - I messed up everything. What is this nonsense? I should have kept my job for Godineau. No, you did the right thing. You think so? You were not happy. I can't even paint. It will come back. - I haven't sold a single painting. - That will come too. Don't be impatient. You're nice. I did not even have enough to pay the hotel this week. It doesn't matter. The owner likes you. You will pay on credit. - You think so?- Yes. And you can leave some paintings as a guarantee. When will you paint my portrait? You painted the boss, but not me. Whenever you want. Promise me you won't drink anymore. This is bad for you. It makes you sad.

Come, the water is hot. Wow, you seem awfully drunk. Let's do our deal first. Come on. Give me the money. One. Two. Three? I'm still not getting rich tonight. Come on, undress now. You'll need to be more active than a post. Come here. You've drunk, huh? You looked depressed tonight. You're sad? What... What do you want? No! You know this is more expensive. You don't have the money. No. Don't undo my hair! It took me an hour to fix my headdress. You leave me alone now! Hey, old man! This is even more expensive! - I want to! - You don't have a penny. - But you're crazy. - Bitch! What's wrong with you? Help! Help! Help! Help! - You have troubles in your head! - What? Go somewhere else! I can't believe it! Thief! Thief! Thief! Never come back here. Cursing in Breton My mother gave me this headdress. It belonged to my grandmother. - But this isn't the Pont-Aven headdress. - No, this is the Kergoulet. My grandmother was from there. Why did you want to paint me dressed as a Breton? Because it's prettier. And it suits you very well. It emphasizes your childish side. You have a doll's face. When I was a kid, my grandmother called me Mary Doll. Ah, see? She told me it was the name of a woman Gauguin loved a lot. Is it true? Yes. But she did not like him. She loved somebody else. I heard he was a bad man. What? Who told you that? Also my grandmother. She told me he was hated because he wanted to sleep with every women. Is that so? Gauguin was like me then. Am I moving too much? No. It's okay. In 15 days, I will leave the guest house. Really? What are you gonna do? Make crepes at the Rospico. I do this every year in July and August. They pay me twice as much as here. I'll be back in September. Will you be here? Perhaps, yes. I also sell donuts and api apples. Come and see me. Api apples are beautiful. A nice red. Turn your head a little. Good. Why don't you go see Marie Pape? With all the money you have, you can convince her to remove her headdress. I'm counting on you, Henri. Don't let me down. Priest, you're my friend, we get drunk together. And I like your face and I'm one of yours. - I'm one of the Lord's chosen ones. - Really? Yeah. A hitchhiker I took one day told me so. A weirdo doing a pilgrimage. - Loyant? - I don't know, he did not say his name. Tall and slim? He travels in sandals, carrying red wine. Ah yes, yes. It's Loyant. The guy has a peculiar appearance! - You know him? - Yes. He'll be here for the bazaar. I hope he won't bring his sister or it will look like the Weirdoes Festival! The pilgrim is coming! We have to celebrate it. No! I don't have the time. - Why? - I must go to Trémalo. - And I have a rendezvous with Mary. - See? See you, the apostle! Say hi to the Christ. Don't let your skirt get caught in the spokes. So? I really like it. - It's very pretty, you know? - Oh... My friend Lena would like you to paint her. Sure, when she wants to. It won't be for nothing. She will pay. She says you are the most talented painter in Pont-Aven. Your friend is really nice. Sit down. It won't be long. We will go catch shrimps tomorrow. Come with us. Okay. Low tide is at 5 AM. Don't forget to wake up. Hey! What did the priest tell me? On Sunday, you will be an actress during the bazaar? I won't act, I will sing in duo with Patrick Le Gueden. I don't have a beautiful voice, but... Lena's lucky. She will act in the biggest play. - She knows many things about Gauguin. - Really? Her grandmother told her. Her great-grandmother worked for Marie-Jeanne Gloanec. People say he was such a pervert no girl accepted to clean his room. Hold it tight! Mr. Henri! We caught a lot! I want you to know that Mr. and Mrs Loyant who came with me and who you know well will pass through the rows between the acts to offer you scapulars of the Immaculate Conception. Please so welcome them warmly. A small change in our program! Our dear Patrick Le Gueden had a moped accident. He won't take part in our play. Thus, our great friend and artist Henri Serin, who has decorated the bazaar, kindly accepted to take his place at such short notice. He will be signing when the curtain rises, with Marie Guédèc "The Farewell Duo", from the great and missed Botrel. Bravo! Bravo, Henri!
