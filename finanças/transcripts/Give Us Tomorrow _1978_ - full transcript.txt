(light gentle music) (engine turning) (door knocking) - Yes? - Who is it-- (woman gasps) Who are you? What do you want? - Take it easy lady. Just relax and no-one will get hurt. - Take that filthy thing off my table! (girl gasps) (girl screaming) (ominous music) - Leave me alone you beast, let me go! - Now, that's it. That's nice. One big happy family. - Mommy, what do they want? - I don't know. - Well, now that we're all together, let's have some breakfast. - We've already finished our breakfast. - Then cook us some, love. - I am not your love. - Now, that ain't nice. I asked you polite. - I'm not a servant. Look, leave us alone. We're respectable people, we lead respectable lives, just, leave us alone. - [Radio] This is Radio London bringing you the news of today, October the 11th. And the big news today is that two Irish ladies, Mrs. Betty Williams and Miss Mairead Corrigan have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to bring the troubles in Northern Ireland to a peaceful conclusion. - [Black Mask Robber] Isn't she a pretty little thing, a right bantam hen. You know, you're not bad looking yourself? Probably a right knock-out in your day. Now you don't wanna get damaged, do you? Why don't you play along like a good girl? - The children have to go to school. - No school today, missus. - Oh, don't be ridiculous. Of course they have to go to school. Nicola's taking her "A" levels. - "A" Levels, isn't she a bright little thing, eh? Now why didn't you take your "A" Levels and you could have worked in a bank? (robber chuckling) No, it's a holiday today. My orders. Just cook us some breakfast. Like we was part of the family, then no one will get scarred. - [Radio] The pound rose by another 15 points against the dollar yesterday. And the stock market was in a cheerful mood as the Financial Times Index climbed another 3 points to its highest level this year, 511.8. About a year ago it was down below the 400 mark, and this recovery indicates a remarkable display of confidence in Britain's economy, and according to a West German delegation of businessmen visiting London, the economy can only get better as Britain's North Sea oil flows on tap in the 1980's. Meanwhile, there's been a massive flow of hot money into the London market by foreign investors, and British reserves rose last month by 1,327,000,000 pounds to 9,826,000,000 pounds. The British Tourist Authority announced that tourism earned us 3,000,000,000 last year, and tourism is now our biggest earner of foreign currency, with over 12 million visitors to these shores predicted for the coming year. It seems that London is fast becoming a city of tourists. And now for your time-check, it's just coming up to 08:37. Despite the apparent recovery in the economy, unemployment remains high at over 6%, almost 1,600,000 today, and there was no immediate sign of this dropping for some years to come. Meantime, feud on crime continues to rise at an alarming rate. With three in four crimes in Great Britain now committed by under 21's, and no less than half by children under 17. (horn honking) The Metropolitan Police say there is no sign of this showing any decrease. They say there is little they can do to contain or combat it. Only yesterday, Cartier's the world famous jewelers in Bond Street, was robbed of rings and bracelets valued at over 400,000 million pounds when thieves walked in and took the jewels from a show case. Police are appealing for passers-by on the street who may have seen the men escape based on the description they'd been given. (ominous rattling) (doorbell ringing) - [Male] Morning, Peter. - Morning, Sir. - [Male] Coffee ready? - It's on the brew. - [Male] Good. (woman gasping) - Nobody move! Not a muscle! Anybody moves, it'll be their last. Stay where you are, or he gets it. Move! Right, nice and easy now. Right, move! Alright, open it up! Everyone outside, one at a time. Nobody needs to get hurt. On the floor, flat! Now you. First, the alarm. Where is it? Come on, make it easy for yourself. And no mistakes. That's what I like, a little cooperation. Now you're gonna make a telephone call. - Who to? - To your wife. - My wife? Why should I call my wife? - To hear what she has to say of course. That's if you ever wanna see her alive again. Now make the call. (telephone rings) - Alright, answer it. Go on. - Hello, Wendy? Wendy? - [Masked Robber] You be very careful what you say. - Who is it? - [Masked Robber] Find out. - Hello? - [Husband] Darling, are you alright? - Oh, Martin. What's going on? - Well, what's happening there? Well there are two men with guns. - And the children, where are they? - [Wendy] They're here with me. - Oh my god. - Please, please, what am I to do? - Don't do anything. Just stay calm. Do as they tell you. I'll take care of it. - Yes, but what's it all about? - Now you listen, buster. You do exactly what you're told, d'you hear? Or I'll blast the lot. Now I'm already up for a long stretch if they catch me, so it don't make no difference to me. - Hello? Hello? - Get the picture? Now you do as I say, and you've got nothing to worry about. Do anything funny, and it's... No, but you're much too smart for that. Now the vault. Open it up! - But I can't do that. It's not possible. - Well you'd better make it possible, and quick! - It needs more than one key to open it. - So? - Well, my assistant has the other one. - Well, where the hell is he? - He comes by train. The train sometimes is late. He should be here soon. - Sodding railways, they screw everything up. Well, you'd better pray he gets here, and quick. (slow light music) - Yeah, that's just the job. Y'know, nothing like a good English breakfast to set you up for the day. Don't forget my mate. - I'm not hungry. - Of course you are! Don't let a little thing like this spoil your appetite. Does he, Mom? Here, what's that? - Coffee. - Coffee? - Ah, gives me the burps. Tea. Give me some tea. - It'll take a little time. - Now, what's the matter? Do you want me to think you don't like us? - How long will you be stopping here? - Well now, that just depends. - [Wendy] On what? - On whether your husband's a good boy and does what he's told. We just wait here for that telephone to ring again, tells us to leave. - Supposing it doesn't ring? - Lady, you'd better start praying it does. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (sobbing women) (doorbell rings) - Alright, answer it. No tricks. - [Male] Good morning, Peter. - Good morning. - [Male] How's the coffee this morning? - It's not ready yet. - This your man? - Yes. - Now aren't you the lucky one. Now get your arse over here! Move it! (women sobbing) All right, tell him. - I need your key to the vault, Tom. - But Mr. Hammond, I can't do that. - Don't argue. These men mean trouble. Give me your key. - I'd like to, but it's more than my job's worth. - Your job ain't worth nothing to you dead, mate. 'Cause that's what you're gonna be if you don't hand over that key. - Damn it man, do you wanna get us all killed? Give us your key! - Very well. - You'll have to take the responsibility. - Yes, of course, now hurry! - On the floor! (women sobbing) - Move! Hold it. You know better than that. - What do you mean? - Think I'm bloody ignorant? The alarm key first. That's better. Now it's all systems go. Open it up! And god help you if anything goes off. (suspenseful music) You too, over. Right, now that one. (women sobbing) Beautiful. Right, now fill 'em up. Leave that. Just the green, the brown, and the blue. - Oh, it's lovely. Makes all the difference when you've got some food inside yah. Now why don't we go in the other room and sit down, relax, quiet like. - I must do the washing up. - Hey, it won't run away. Sit down and wait for that little old bell to ring and then after that, we can leave you in peace. That is what you want, isn't it? - All I want is for you to go. - All in good time, missus, all in good time. Get out. - Jamie. - Now, well we don't want any nosey parkers looking in, do we? Now relax, missus. We ain't so bad. I know a dozen others who'd have you stretched naked on the deck by now. Believe me, the sooner that bell rings, the better I like it. Oh. (robber burps) Terrible digestion. Never can keep no nosh down. It's me nerves you know. (dramatic music) - That's it. Tie the bags up. (women sobbing) Right, back up. Now, let's go! (shotgun fires) (dramatic music) (car screeches) - [Robber] Blimey, how the rich live. - We're not rich. - Well I wouldn't mind a pad like this. Would you, kid? Course you wouldn't, given half the chance. Now that's the main thing, chance. - My husband had to work very hard for this. It took years of hard work to buy this house. - With a little help from his bank, course. - He works for them, doesn't he? - Sure he does, a nice safe bank manager's job. 10,000 a year, no sweat. And all the other poor buggers who don't have no job, all they gotta do is ask! Men like your husband. And what does he say? "Where's your security?" Security. What's that? Lady, I could put a bullet through your brain, now how secure would you be then? (dramatic music) - Oh my god. You bloody fool! Why'd you have to do that? I must get home to my wife. Look, somebody call an ambulance, quickly! Tom, you, you look after things here will you? (somber music) - Just a small transaction, you understand. Since the banks won't help us, we're helping ourselves. Now that is fair, innit? With all the big fat profits they're making, they're not gonna miss a few nicker. That's gonna be one in the eye for all your fucking bank managers! - He can't do just as he pleases, you must understand, he has some, responsibilities. - Well, now we're doing it my way. No more crawling to fucking bank managers or social security for hand outs. You can piss on 'em all! - Please, don't use language like that in this house. - It might be your house, lady but it is my mouth. - And a foul mouth it is, too! - Well at least it talks straight, which is more than I can say for all your bloody hypocrites! (car engine turns) (ominous music) (slow light music) Well relax lady, we'll be gone soon, then you can kiss us goodbye forever. You can think of us relaxing in some tropical isle, soaking up the sun, while you continue with your wet little lives. - I don't know what you mean by "wet". Just because we're respectable. But you wouldn't understand that. - What, respectable? Just 'cos you live in some swish house on some swanky street, respectable? Do me a favor. - Well you don't seem to have respect for anything. - There's only one thing I respect. - What's that? - That's the same as everybody else. Money. That'll buy me all the respect that I need. - Money isn't everything. - Not when you've got it, it ain't. - You don't need money to make something of yourself. - You know, it's funny lady. The only people I ever hear say that are the one's who've got it. And do you know why? 'Cause the other poor bastards without it are too busy trying to scratch for a living. - That is no excuse for stealing. - Well now don't you fret yourself lady, 'cause the bank can afford it. And with money, nobody cares who you are. You can be Chairman of the Board, you can be President, or you can be simply that guy that robs the bank. You can buy anything. Or anybody. I could even buy you. - You've got a hope. - Hope? Oh, I gave up hoping a long time ago, lady. It don't pay. You're no different from any other kind of skirt. Offer you the world, you'd be off like a shot. - Not without my family I wouldn't. (suspenseful music) - What's your name, lady? - Mrs. Hammond. - Oh yeah I know that, but what's your first name? Come on, don't be shy. Sarah? Jennifer? Veronica? Do you know, you like like a Veronica to me. - It's none of your business. - Oh, come on now. Just trying to be sociable. Give us a kiss. - It's Wendy if you must know. - Wendy eh? Well I'm Peter Pan. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (somber music) (car screeching) What the hell. Kid, stay here. - Wendy! Wendy! Where's my wife? - [Robber] What are you doing back, you shouldn't have come back. - What have you done to my wife? - [Robber] Are you alone? - Where is she, I wanna see her? - Just stay there, mister! Just stay there. All right, get in there. Go on! - Darling! - Oh, Martin! - Are you alright? - Oh, that's very touching, but hey, what happened at the bank? - Look, you've got what you wanted, now get out. - Did you hear that? They done it, they pulled it off. We're rich, boy! There's gonna be no holding us back now, come on! Let's pack it in. Here lady, we're going now. Now, no hard feelings, no harm done, right? - Get out, get out! - Now listen here, mate! You keep your cool, eh? Just being polite. Come on. Stay good, lady. (ominous music) 'Ere, wait a minute. - What's the matter? - We can't go yet. - Well why not, the job's done isn't it? - And we agreed they should phone. Why haven't they phoned? - Well perhaps they couldn't get to a phone? - How do we know they got away clear? We've only got his word for it, this could be a trap. - Oh, come on, Ron, you're only guessing. Look, let's get out of here. - And run into the police at the bottom of the street? No, I don't like it, it stinks. They should've phoned. That was the plan. (shotgun clicking) Here, let's find out. - Are you all right sonny? - Daddy, did you see that gun he had? Can I have a gun like that? - Oh, don't be silly Jamie. - [Robber] Oi! - I thought you'd gone. - All in good time, mate. First, I wanna know straight. Did they get away with the money? - Yes, I already told you. - I know what you told me, but is there anything else? - No, there's nothing else. They just took the money and left. - You're sure they got clean away? - Yes, yes! - Oh, come on, Ron. - Why don't you give 'em my address while you're about it! - Well we can still get away before the coppers find us. - They, they won't find us. They don't even know we're here. The only one who knows we're here is him. No. I think we'll stick around for a bit. Wait for that call. - Look, we've done everything you've asked. We can't do any more. (door knocking) - Who can that be? - Well, how should I know? It could be anybody. - It's a policeman. - What'd I tell you, he's crossed us. You lousy creep! - So what do we do now? We've gotta do something! - Alright, you come with-- Hey you! You cover this little lot. Now don't you, don't you make a sound. Don't you even breathe, if you know what's good for you! If they move, you blast 'em! Right you, get outside! (cocks gun) Alright. You answer him. Say anything you like, but you get rid of him, huh? - [Officer] Good morning, Sir. - Yes Officer. - Mr. Hammond isn't it, sir? - What can I do for you, Constable? - You're the manager of the London Provincial Bank in High Street? - Yes, that's right. - I thought I recognized you, sir. When you passed me back there. You seemed to be in quite a hurry, sir. - Yes, I'm sorry. I had to get home quickly. - Oh, trouble sir? - Oh no, just a call from my wife, that's all. - [Officer] Anything I can do to help sir? - No, no, it's just another domestic crisis. You know how it is. - Quite sir. Yes, everything's alright then? - You know how women are, they get excited over the most trivial thing. - Yes, well, take it easy next time sir. I wouldn't want to have to book you for dangerous driving would I? The local bank manager. - Yes, I'll, I'll watch it. - Yes, well we'll leave it at that then, shall we sir? I take it you'll be going back to the bank shortly? - Oh yes, just as soon as I get things sorted out here. - You're sure your wife's alright sir, there's nothing I can do? - She's perfectly all right. - Oh, just one thing before I go sir. That van parked outside. - Oh the van? I hadn't noticed it. - Do you have any workmen in the house sir? - No, nobody. - Then you don't know who it belongs to? - No, I'm afraid I don't Constable. - I see sir. Well, I'd better look into it. Somebody must have dumped it there, we can't have it despoiling the road, can we sir? I'll have it removed. Thank you sir. - You should've been an actor. - [Dispatch] Control to all units. Report your positions. Keep a look-out for a large car travelling at speed. Occupants are armed. Do not attempt to intercept. Repeat, do not intercept. Control over. - Sector Four to control. I'm in Chislehurst Road. What's cooking? Over. - [Dispatch] Sector Four, there's been a hold-up at the London Provincial Bank in the High Street. One man shot. Over. - Sector Four to Control. Patch me through to Sergeant Wilson. I've got something for him. - [Dispatch] Stand by, Sector Four. - [Wilson] This is Wilson, what is it Mac? - It's about that bank raid Sergeant. I'm at the bank manager's house. - [Wilson] What are you doing there? - I followed him, Sergeant. I thought he was in a wee bit of a hurry to get home at this time in the morning. - [Wilson] Is that so? WelL he's wanted back at the bank. Get him there fast. - I don't think that's gonna be so easy, Sergeant. - [Wilson] What are you talking about, McLaren? Just get him back to the bank. That's an order. - I'm gonna need some assistance, Sergeant. - [Wilson] McLaren, what's the matter with you? Have you gone soft? One man? Can't you handle one man alone now? - It's not as simple as that Sergeant. I think we've got a situation here. Somebody's holding a gun on him. (dramatic music) - Has he gone? I told you, we should've got away before. - What, and bumped straight into him? That would've been real clever, wouldn't it? - Well what are we gonna do now? If he stays there... - Well we can always shoot our way out, can't we? I mean that's what we brought these for, innit? - Well I didn't really reckon on having to use it. - Well what do you think this is, do you think this is a film? You think this is Butch Cassidy? Now you listen Sundance, you've only got one chance. So you'd better grab it! Remember, nobody helps them who don't help themselves. - Don't listen to him. That sort of talk will only help you to an early grave. - Shut it, mister! - You know, you haven't got a hope of getting away with this now. - Balls, you just watch. We've got you and while we hold you, they won't dare make a move. Now you remember that! - Perhaps we'd better pack it in. - Now that's a sensible thing to do. - I told you to shut it! I've had enough of your bright remarks. You were the one who already buggered up this deal by coming back. You should have stayed where you belong in that fucking bank! - I dunno Ron, if they snatch that motor, how we gonna get away? - Look, kid, don't get soft on me now. Just think of all that loot. 100,000 nicker! We've gotta give 'em time to get away. Look, the longer we hold 'em here, the longer they got. And the cops? They don't know nothin', they don't even know we're here. They think this joker came back just to see his wife! - That Constable is waiting for me outside. You forget, they want me back at the bank. - Yeah, well let him wait. Your wife's sick. You can't leave her. - And how long do you think they'll accept that? - Long enough. Until that telephone rings. Just until that telephone rings. (dramatic music) - Well, McLaren, what's this situation you've got? - Not sure Sarge. There's no sign of anything since I spoke with you on the radio. - Are you sure that was a gun you saw? - That's what it looked like, through the glass. - Hmm, I'd better go and see. Wait here. (Wilson knocking) - Nobody move. - Well somebody'll have to answer. - Let him stew. - Mr. Hammond, are you there? This is Sergeant Wilson of the local police. I'd like to have a word with you please, Sir. - Well, it's your move. What now? - Alright, answer him. But from here. Shout. - Well, what do I tell him? - Anything, but you make it good. Get rid of him, for your sake. - Yes Sergeant, what is it? - Mr. Hammond, will you open the door please? I would like to speak with you. - I can't Sergeant, not right now. - [Wilson] Why, what's your problem? - Well it's... There's no problem, it's my wife. - [Wilson] Is she hurt? - No, she's just resting. I've given her a sedative. It's better she's not disturbed - I see. Well I'll still have to speak to you sir, it's about the raid at your bank. Now we can't talk through the door. - Well, later Sergeant. You go on, I'll follow in a moment. - I hope so, Sir. We need you to help with our inquiries. Don't be too long, will you? We'll be waiting for you. (chimes chiming) - Well, Sir. What do you make of it? - Yeah, you could be right. Drawn curtains, looks like a funeral. There's something fishy. I'll call the inspector. You go and chat to some of the neighbors, they might have seen something. You never know your luck. - Just one thing, Sir. This van, it's empty. - We'll let the experts go over it. They might come up with something. Oh and McLaren, be discrete will you? We don't want to upset the natives. - Well, that got rid of him. - But not for long. You don't think the police are fooled that easily? - No, it's all you know Mr. Bank Manager. They're dumb! Do you know how they make most of their arrests, eh? Through information received. From narks, splitting on 'em. They couldn't find a monkey in a zoo! - You underestimate them! - Yeah, and you smoke too much. It'll be the death of you. If you live that long. - Can I go upstairs please? - What? - Can I go upstairs please? - Oh, later, girlie. - I want to go to the toilet. (Ron chuckling) - Well we can't have you pissin' in your pants, can we? Here, you'd better take her. Keep your eye on her, these girls get up to all kind of tricks. While you're up there, close all the windows and draw the curtains, alright? Go on. - Be careful, darling. - Relax, Mother. He won't touch her if she behaves herself. - You're not coming in with me are you? (slow piano solo) (toilet flushing) Did you think I climbed out of the window? - Hey, where do you think you're going? - I want to change my clothes. (light gentle music) (chimes chiming) All right, stay there if you want to be nosy. Well, aren't you going to say something? Don't you think I have nice breasts? - [Robber] They're alright. - Is that all you can say? - [Robber] They're a bit small aren't they? - Oh, don't tell me you're one of those. - One of who? - Those men who slobber over big boobs. All heavy and droopy. Like the girls on television. - I haven't really thought about it. - Haven't you? I thought that all men did. Think about girls' boobs I mean. I want mine to stay firm and hard, so I don't need to wear a bra. I massage them every day you know. You're supposed to massage them, it helps the muscles. - What are you two playing at up there! It don't take all that time to have a pee! - Yeah, we're comin'. I think you'd better put somethin' on. Come on. Come on. Can't you hurry up? - Get down here, you two! - Will you do something for me? - [Robber] What? - Let me see your face. - Oh, oh, I don't know about that. I mean he said we shouldn't, all that identification and all that. - I won't tell anyone, promise! You're not afraid to let me see what you're really like are you? - Oh well, I don't suppose it matters now. There. - You're not so bad. - About soddin' time. That was a bloody long pee. Are you sure you didn't knock off a quick one, eh? (Ron chuckles) Hey, look at this, then. A proper little cock-teaser. She getting to you, boy? You'd better watch it, she'll be tearing your pants off next. - You mind your language. Do you have to be so crude? - Oh, come off it lady, who do you think you're kidding, eh? She ain't no baby, I bet there's nothing much you could teach her. - You're loathsome, don't you dare touch her. - Ooh, what are you gonna do? You gonna call the cops, eh? Look, I thought I told you to keep your mask on! - There wasn't much point anymore. - Point? You'll see the bloody point when they put you in an I.D. parade! Alright then, let's all have a party then. Well now, that's better. Handsome, aren't I? You think you could go for a fella like me? - You make me feel sick. - Oh! They're all the same, these class Sheilas you know. One minute they're pretending to hate the sight of you, and the next minute you're fighting them off. Y'know why? They don't get enough of it! That's why they go for all these milkman and window cleaners. Isn't that right, lady? Ain't that right, mush? - We're very happy and we lead a normal sex life. My wife has never complained, if that's what you're suggesting. - What are you gonna give him, eh? 60, 70, 80, 90 out of 100? - I think this has gone far enough. - I don't want to discuss it. - Well of course you don't because you don't wanna admit you're not getting enough cock, do ya? - Is that the sort of gun the police use on television? - Jamie, come here! - How does it shoot? - [Wendy] Jamie! - How many bullets does it fire? - What's the matter Kid? Are you planning on starting a war? - I was only asking. - Well, you know what curiosity did, don't you? - No. What did it do? - Why don't you ask your mother, she's got all the answers. (sirens wailing) - Attention. This is the police. We have the house completely surrounded. We know that you are armed, and we know that you are holding Mr. and Mrs. Hammond in there. Now there is no possibility of your escaping. We suggest therefore that you come out peaceably, and surrender yourselves before any more harm is done. Nothing can be gained by your staying inside. Throw out your weapons, and come out with your hands up. - No imagination these coppers. - If you had any sense, you'd give yourself up. - Give ourselves up? You must be kidding! It's them or us. Or you. Remember that. You're our trump card. (chimes chiming) - Look, let them go. I mean, be reasonable. Hold me if you like, but let them go. - What, break up the family? Now that wouldn't be nice, would it? - You enjoy frightening innocent children, don't you? - Well, they don't look very frightened to me. Now then, why don't we all cool it down. And why don't you get us a nice cup of char, eh? - Take your hands off me you filthy animal! - Ooh, I like that eh? Ain't she got spirit, I must give her that. Here, is she always like that eh? I'll bet she leads you a merry old chase. Now then, what about a cup of old Rosy, eh? - Get it yourself! - Now that's not nice. No way to treat guests. Be nice! (suspenseful music) - All right, but you needn't think I'm waiting on you. - Keep your eye on 'em. Hey, some set-up you've got here. All the mod-cons. Must've cost you quite a few nicker. My old lady'd do her nut to have a kitchen like this. Still be a lousy cook of course. Hamburger and chips. That's about her mark. She likes to eat out. - I'm not surprised if she's married to you. - She gets what she wants, she ain't complaining. Mind, there's only one problem. Money. She loves to spend, spend, spend. Gotta give it to her, don't I? - Does she know how you get your money? - Well you don't think that she thinks I'm a bank manager, do you? We got spliced before I went inside last time. Five bloody years wasted. No, I can't leave her again, can I? Now then! What have we got here? Fuck me, look at this! Bingo, we've hit the jackpot! You don't mean to go short, do you? - It's called bulk buying, it's more economical if you must know! - Economical, oh. I'll bet not many people could afford this little lot. - It's just a question of proper planning. - Is that right? Well I must tell my missus that. Well they're not gonna starve us out! We could stand a bloody siege, there must be enough here to last a month. Now, why don't you cook us up a nice nosh, eh darlin'? Now, let's see what we'll 'ave. Chicken. Leg of lamb. Hey. Smoked salmon. (quirky music) - How did a boy like you get involved in something like this? - It was just a bit of fun, like. - Fun? Oh you think this is fun, threatening people in their own home? - Yeah, well I didn't know it was gonna work out like this, did I? I mean, it was only a way of getting some money. - Why, you need money that badly? - Doesn't everybody? - Do we know how many people are in there? - Can't be sure, Sir. Mr. and Mrs. Hammond, they've got two children, but they should be at school. We're checking. We don't know how many of the bandits are in there. - So all we have to go on at the moment is P.C. McLaren's sighting of the gun, one voice, and the van. - That's about it, Sir. The experts are going over the van now for fingerprints, that may tell us something. - Well, we'd better reckon on two of them at any rate, maybe more. All right? We'll just sit tight, and wait for them to make their move. - Yeah. Y'know, that was real smashin'! I'll bet you make a rare steak and kidney pie. I'm gonna recommend you to my mates. - Don't bother. - You know, you should really thank us, you're gonna live off this for years. Think of all the attention you're gonna have, hey? Telly, newspapers, films even. You'll be able to sell your story for a fortune. You should pay me a royalty. - I don't need that kind of attention, thank you. - You should have something to eat. She really can cook. - Ron, I've been thinking. - Oh Christ, now we're for it. The Great Brain. I told you boy, I'll do all the thinkin' - No, I mean what do these mean by "any more harm"? - What are you talkin' about? - The bloke, you know, the copper on the loudspeaker? Well he said "any more harm". Well, we haven't done any have we? - Yeah, well look he's only talking. He's tryin' to con yah. I told you, you can never trust a copper. They're always tryna trick yah. - How do we know what happened at that bank? - Well, he was there. He should know. Yeah, what did happen at that bank? - I told you. - Yeah, I know you did. But you tell us again, and this time you keep nothing out. Go on. - It was one of my clerks, he set off the alarm. - Always has to be some joker, don't there eh? Well, so what happened? - They shot him. He was only a young man, not much older than him. He thought he was doing his duty and they shot him. - The stupid bastard. He shouldn't have interfered, should he? Well he asked for it, didn't he? Shouldn't have tried to be so clever. Always someone wants to be some hero. - Here look, they can't blame us for that can they? Look, we weren't even there! Ron, look, let's just get out of here. - What, and spend a lifetime in some stinking jail? Listen kid, we're accessories whether we was there or not. They'll pin it on us, don't you fret. - How can they? We was nowhere near the place. - They'll find a way. Law always does. - But that's not fair. - Fair? We're not talking about fair. We're talking about the law! At least now we know we've got nothing to lose. No, don't worry kid. I'll get you out. I'll figure a way. - You're a bigger fool than I thought you were. They boy's right, the house is surrounded. You can't get away. - Oh, dry up lady, I don't need advice from people like you. (telephone rings) That's him. Yeah? Yeah? Who is this? - This is Superintendent Ogilvie of the Metropolitan Police. Who am I speaking to? - Yeah, wouldn't you like to know, mate? - [Ogilvie] Are you the leader of the group? - Look, look, look, speak your piece, copper. What do you want? - Are you listening? - Well I'm here, aren't I? Get on with it. - Whatever your purpose is, you can't possibly achieve anything. You're holding innocent people in there. Let them go, then come out yourselves, one at a time. Throw your guns out of the window first. We don't want to be shooting, but we're armed, and if you start anything we shall be forced to retaliate. Now each of you, come out with your hands in the air. - And then what? - [Ogilvie] Then you'll be taken into custody and held, awaiting trial in the usual way. - That don't seem much of a deal to me, copper. - We are making no deals. That's the way it has to be. - Go stuff yourself. - What did he say? - Oh, the usual crap. They expect us to walk out of here and fall into their waiting arms. - Well what can we do? There's only us two. - Well they don't know that, do they? There could be four, five, six of us here for all they know. Nah, we gotta keep 'em guessing. (quirky music) - We could try turning off the water and electricity, Sir. - No. The family would suffer as much as anybody. And we don't know their state of health. No, we'll just wait. They're not going anywhere. Let them do the sweating. - Got anything for us, Mr. Ogilvie? - Well, you can see for yourselves, they can't get away. We have marksmen positioned all around the house. - Are you expecting them to shoot their way out? - They'd be foolish if they tried. No, I would think that most unlikely. - What about the hostages they're holding? - What about them? - Are they alright? - Well, as far as we know. - How many bandits are there in there? - Two at least I should say, we can't be sure. Four, possibly five at the most. - [Woman] Have you identified them yet? - No. The two who took part in the raid at the bank were masked. And apparently, there was a girl involved. - [Male Reporter] How will you flush them out? - Oh, we're not going to try. We have all the time in the world, and patience always brings its reward. - [Male Reporter] Is there any political motivation do you think? - Well that hasn't been established yet. - [Woman Reporter] But you've had communication with them? Have they made any demands? - I've spoken with them, and I've told them there will be no deals. If they come out quietly, there'll be no trouble. - Do you think that likely when they've already committed one murder? (clock ticking) (clock chiming) - I suppose you're feeling very proud of yourself. - Proud? Yes, yes I am. 100,000 nicker. Now that's not bad for a day's work, is it? - Not a thought for that poor boy who was murdered, or his family? - Yeah, well it's a pity about that. But the way I see it, he's only got himself to blame. I mean getting yourself killed, that ain't smart, is it? No way to live. - He was an honest boy, he was doing an honest job. - Now you see, honesty gets you nowhere. - Oh god you're impossible. You twist everything. You despise anyone who works for a living, don't you? - Suckers, that what I call 'em, but don't ask me, ask him. He'd like to work, wouldn't you boy? - Well nobody's stopping him if he gets a proper job. - Yeah, you know something lady? You have got a big mouth, and nothing comes out of it. Don't you ever read the newspapers? Don't you ever tell her, hey? Tell me something, now would you give him a job? - He probably doesn't have the qualifications. - Qualifications, eh? Did you hear that missus? Qualifications. That is the name of the game! - If you'd worked harder when you were at school and you had the chance, you might have gained some. - Oh, bullshit lady. He don't wanna be no doctor, or professor. He just wants a job, don't you lad? Three soddin' years since he left school and nobody wants him. - Well I'm not surprised if he hangs around with the likes of you! - Now you leave me out of it, I'm different. I know what I'm up to. But all he wants is a job. Qualifications? Now what good are they if you wanna be a, wanna be a driver? So he pulls a stunt like this, and then another, and then another. And you know why? All because clever sods like you, you just don't wanna know. You know, you make me puke. You are full of shit lady, just shit! - Oh, leave it Ron. - All right. I'll do, I'll do something. I'll get you out of this. - Don't listen to him, look. He's just making things worse for you. Can't you see that? - Oh, can it lady. Christ! She's the bossy one, isn't she? Why don't you shut her mouth before I belt her one! (dramatic music) - Mommy, I'm thirsty. Can I have a drink? - Yes, of course dear. Well you can't deny the boy that? - Yeah, it's a good idea boy. I could do with one myself. Right then squire, where do you keep it, eh? Come on now, you can afford it. Ooh. What have we got 'ere? Ooh, now look at this. Here, you could open a club. Help yourself. Thank you, I will. Oh squire, you're ready for a right old booze up. Vodka, brandy, gin. Cinzano? Yeah, sounds indecent to me. It's pronounced Chin-zano, and I rather like it. - Oh, well I knew you had to have some vices. Well, scotch will do me fine. - What about my son? - Well, this is too rich for him. Don't want him to turn into an old boozer like his old man. - There is some cola in the kitchen. - Ooh, that is better. Well let the girl take him. No, don't you move. I don't trust you. Here, go along with them. Make sure the little bugger don't make a run for it. And careful what you do with that bird, we don't want mom shouting the odds do we? (telephone rings) Yeah? Oh, it's you again. Yeah, well look. I'll make you a little proposition. Listen! Can't you listen?! Look, I got four hostages here, I'll shoot them one at a time if you don't listen! Now that's better. Now we want a safe conduct out of here. Do you hear that? Look I know one man's already dead, but that was nothing to do with us! Bloody twisters! I'll show 'em. - [Nicola] Do you want some? - Yeah. Thanks. - You don't say much, do you? - Well there's not much to say really, is there? - Is that really how you got into this, because you couldn't find work? - Yeah, I suppose so. There was nothing much else to do. It seemed a pretty good idea. - What if you get caught? - I don't really think about it. I mean you see it on the telly all the time, don't yah? Doesn't seem so difficult. Besides... - What? - Well, you think it's never gonna happen to you, don't yah? Only I mean, it wasn't as though I was in the actual raid. - What did you do before if you didn't work? - Y'know, we got up, walked about a bit. It was a crowd of us y'know. We started nicking from shops and lorries, that sort of thing. It was the only thing there was. Well this came along, it was a bit of excitement. - Do you still think that? - I dunno now. I dunno. I mean that bloke who was killed, now I had nothin' to do with that, did I? - I'm sorry. - Well it's not your fault. - I wish there was something I could do. We'd better be getting back I suppose. - Are you finished? - Y'know, it's funny. I thought after we pull this off, with the right dough, I might get somewhere. Y'know, get started up somewhere. Australia perhaps. I could've got there. And they say it's pretty easy to make a decent living down there. New Zealand. South America even. I mean you only need a chance, don't ya? - How about you squire? You feel like a drink? - Not right now thank you. - Oh, look, don't mind about her. How about some of your Cinzano, hey love? Or don't you drink with the likes of me? You know I reckon you'd be a good screw given half the chance. You got good arse on you, I tell you that. - Oi! - Whatsum matter love, are you frustrated eh? Are you frustrated? The old squire not give you enough? Now why don't you and me, we just knock off a quick one, eh? I'll show you one or two things, I promise you that. Now you know the old saying, don't ya? "A fuck a day keeps old age at bay." - That's enough! - We've had enough of this! Want your head blown off? You just stay there, chappie. Now, you don't want me to lose my cool, do ya? Now, here's to crime. Long may it prosper. Hmm! Oi kid, help yourself to a drink. It's on the 'ouse. Bank manager's perks. - I just had some coke. - Coke? That's cat's piss. That'll put hairs on your chest. Here's lookin' at you, girl. You fancy her? - [Boy] I haven't really thought about it. - Haven't really thought about it? Course you have. Make you feel horny just lookin' at her. - She's all right, yeah. - All right he says. Hey, she's real class. She's not one of your scrubbers from down the den, hm? She's only a filly of course. By god, give her a couple of years and she'll lead the field. You won't have a chance then boy. - What are you saying? - Just doing a bit of match-making lady, there's no harm in that. Since we've got a little time to kill, we might as well use it. - Don't be ridiculous. She's not interested in him. - What, he's not good enough? Hey, boy. You want her? - Don't you dare touch her. - Now Wendy girl, you behave yourself. You wanna live to be a grandmother don't ya? - She's only a child, she's, she's 16. - Sweet 16 and never been, eh? Well, now's her big chance. Where I come from, they're old pro's at 16. - Where you come from I'm not surprised, you're scum! - Them harsh words lady, harsh words. - Well, don't just sit there, do something. - Like what? Getting his head blown off? - Well you can't just sit there, she's your daughter. They're going to rape her, don't you see? - Rape? Now who said anything about rape? Christ! She don't half rabbit on, eh? How do you stand it? Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap. Don't she ever stop? - Oh, you savage! You disgusting, despicable pig! - Oh lay off, love! You're jealous! You know that? Now don't you worry, your turn will come. I will see to you personal. How do you like it? Rough I bet. It's all the same with these prissy birds, you're about to get down to it, and they're worse than Piccadilly whores! - Look, be reasonable. Let's discuss this rationally. You can see she's only a child. - Only a child? Phew. She looks ready to me! All right for a bit of the old one-two? How about it love? You fancy a tickle? - Stop it! She doesn't know what you're talking about! - Course she does! Look at her! She's been eyeing him ever since we came in. She can't keep her eyes off him. Go on kid. Take Snow White upstairs and show her what's what. - You leave her alone! - Why? Well what are you saving her for? Some snotty nose bank clerk? - I don't know Ron. - Ah, come on. Now what are you waiting for? It's Christmas. It's a present. She's free 'n knowing. - Well, it doesn't seem right. - Fuck me! It's on a plate! Get up them stairs! - You stay here Nicola. I won't let you! (Martin groaning) God! - What were you sayin' squire? Now then, why don't you go and enjoy yourself while you can? Tomorrow it might be too late! - Oh Nicola baby, you can't, you can't. - Of course she can! She's gonna love him for it. Go on kids. Have fun. (slow light music) - My baby. (Wendy sobbing) My baby. - There'll be red letters in her diary today! Hey, what say we settle down and watch some telly? With a bit of luck we might find something interesting? (light gentle music) (chimes chiming) - D'you? - [Male On TV] Initial entry. There are now some 27 jumped. And this is against the clock from the start. This magnificent gray horse comes up to a big spread fence, which is the first fence. (light gentle music) - Have you done this before? Will you love me? Will you show me? You won't hurt me, will you? Tell me what to do. - [Male On TV] Over the circular wall, and then the little ornamental gate at a rather awkward angle. Now she comes up to the combination. A one stride and then two strides. - Please don't hurt me. - Oh, who wants to see bloody horses prancing about? Ah, that's it. Yeah, that's better. That's more like it. - I think it's his only one machine gun up there. - Right? - Yeah. - I'll get word back to Klasky. Keep 'em busy. (gun firing) - Show me. Tell me how. I want to learn. (Nicola moaning) - Attaboy kid, you give it to 'em. - You enjoy seeing people hurt, don't you? - Well they asked for it, didn't they? - Hey you think you got a private war? - No, I think there's enough to go around. (light gentle music) - Oh no, no please, it hurts, no please. - That's it. Look at him, the kid's only 19 he's really ripping into him. That's the stuff kid, you show 'em. - That's your idea of fun I suppose? - Look lady, if there were a few more wars, we wouldn't be doing this. That's the trouble today, there are no decent wars to fight. If there was, we'd all be heroes. - Or dead. - Oh, that's good. Oh, it feels so good. Is it always like this? (gun firing) - [Male On TV] That did it! - Oh, that's so good. Oh, I feel so good. Be kind to me. (light gentle music) I want. Please, please. I love you, love you. Do you love me? Oh yes. That's wonderful. Oh. Oh kiss me. Kiss me hard. Harder. Harder. (chimes chiming) (Nicola moaning) I want you. Yes, I want. Please, hurt me. Hurt me! (dramatic music) (Nicola moaning) (gun firing) Thank you. I always wondered what it would be like. - Bang, bang! - Jamie? Jamie, where are you! Jamie? Jamie, where are you? (Wendy gasps) Jamie. (suspenseful music) Jamie, what are you doing? Come down here. - Hands up! - You'd better drop that gun kiddo. - Hands up, or I'll shoot! - You don't cover me up, do ya? Get him down here! - Stop playing Jamie, and come down. - [Jamie] Hands up, or I'll shoot! - Better not kid, you don't wanna get killed do ya? - Listen to me Jamie. Put the gun down It's not a toy. - But Daddy, I can save you. - Put it down! It isn't a game. (gun fires) - I could have shot him Mommy. I could have shot him. - Oh yes. Oh yes darling. And you were very brave. - Stupid I call it, letting a boy play with a gun. Likely to get himself dead, that's no way to live. - Yes, killing little boys is about your mark. - Listen lady he's your son, you shoulda looked after him better! And what's the matter with you, you got a death wish? Letting a little kid take a gun from you! - [Officer] All right now, get back. Come along. Back, further. Right, back. - You should whack him one missus, that's the only way they ever learn. - Is that the way you learned? - My old man walloped me so much my nickname was "black eye". - It didn't seem to do you much good. - Well at least it taught me if I don't look after myself, nobody else will. (telephone rings) Yeah? - What's going on in there? - What do you think, copper? We're having a ball. Ere, do you wanna come and join us? - Well what was that noise we heard? - Noise? What noise? - It sounded like a shot. - Nah, shot? (TV gun firing) Must be the telly. All these war films they keep on showing. (TV exploding) Hey, you hear me now? - Is anybody hurt? Do you need anything? - [Ron] Look copper we've got all the comforts of home here. What more could we want? - Somebody might want medical attention. - That's right, we might. But we don't. So cool it copper, you ain't gonna get in that way. - It's getting late. Come on now, give yourselves up. - What? What'd you say? I can't quite hear ya. It's gone very quiet in here. - Doh, come along now. Be reasonable. You know you can't hope to achieve anything. Make it easy on yourselves. And on those people you are holding in there. Give yourselves up. - Make it easy for you, you mean. Now you listen, copper. If you're so worried about us, I'll tell you what the deal is. - [Officer] I've told you, there will be no deals. - Listen, goddamn ya! Jesus, don't you ever listen? Alright? Okay. We want a car. Now, we got four hostages in here, right? Two of us will come out with two of them. And the other two will stay here with our mates, and guarantee that nothing happens to us, right? Nobody follows us, see? Now we keep the two hostages, until we hear our mates are away too. If not, you'll find 'em in a ditch somewhere, very dead. You understand that? Hello? Hey, you still there? Hey, what about it then? - What sort of car do you want? - Ere, you call yourself a driver, what sort of car? - A Jag I suppose. - A Jag? You got Jags on the brain, you berk. They'll spot that a couple of miles away. - His car's outside. - Smart, yeah. Bank manager's car. They won't have time to tamper with that. 'Ere, you hear that? Yeah, well we'll take the bank manager's car outside. You make sure that it's got a full tank. And the road's clear. No tricks mind ya. Right, we'll be ready in 15 minutes. Coppers. Give me a pain in the arse. (suspenseful music) Alright then. Here's what we do. We take the two birds, you'll like a little trip with loverboy. Call it your honeymoon. - You're not taking anybody without me. - Oh, well you leave me no choice. (Martin grunting) Tie him up. - I'm not going with you. - Oh, is that right lady? We'll see. - I am not going to leave my home. - All set, Sir. - Good. Now remember, nobody makes a move without my signal. There are innocent lives at stake. Understood? - Sir. - All right. Give them the okay. - You inside the house, this is the police. Everything's ready. You can come out. - Make sure he's secure. - Well this should hold him. - Well gag him! - That won't be necessary. - Oh, what are you gonna do, give me your word of honor? - [Martin] If that's what you want! - You make me scream. Gentleman's honor? I wouldn't take the word of the Pope! Gag him! (suspenseful music) - Oh, you will pay for this! - I wouldn't take no bets lady, you won't be alive to collect. Now, now it's the little boy's turn. - Well you're not gonna tie him up? - You don't think I'm gonna let him run around loose do ya? - He's just a little boy, he won't do any harm. - He's already tried, hasn't he? Now he won't get hurt if he behaves himself. - Oh Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, please! God you! - You didn't know you was married to a regular tigress, did yah? Don't worry, I'll tame her for yah. (Jamie grunting) Alright then go on, put him in the cupboard, come on. Out you get. - No no! - [Wendy] It's dark in there! - The dark won't kill him. Go on then, get him in there. - Oh, you bastard! (suspenseful music) (Jamie grunting) - Right, that's it! I've just about had enough of you! You shut your fucking gob! Come 'ere! - I hope they kill you! - I ain't ready to die yet lady, but you remember one thing, if they kill me, they also kill you. Now that'll keep you quiet. - [Officer] Come along. I've told you before. Move right back. You don't want to get hurt now, do you? Move back. - Look, put your mask on, you wanna give the game away? - Oh look for Christ sake, Ron it's over! - Listen to me! Now look, you take the skirt and I'll take the old lady. Now this is what you do. You take her out real close to you as you get outside the door. Keep the gun against her head. Move very slowly to the car. When you get there, you get in first. You listening to me? And then you pull her in after yah. Check everything. Check the ignition, check the petrol, check everything. And when it's okay, you give me a couple of toots on that horn. Alright? - But what if it's not okay out there? - You listen to me! It's gonna be all right. I've planned it all out haven't I? Look, they're not gonna do nothin' when you got the girl! Now get out! - Oh, mommy, mommy. Oh daddy! - Put your mask on I said! Now hold it. All right copper! Douse those lights, we're comin' out! (chimes chiming) Alright, go on, out you go. Keep that gun up. Go on. - [Boy] Come on, slowly now. I don't wanna hurt you. We're gonna be all right. - What's your name? Tell me your name. - [Boy] Come on, we're gonna make it. We're gonna make it, we'll be all right. (Nicola sobbing) (ignition grinds) (engine starts) (horn honking) - Okay love bird, this is your big scene. Now you try and be clever and your husband will be a widower. Cheerio squire, don't cash any dud checks! Here we go, nice and easy. Just like my old man used to say. (muffled shouting) Get over here! Hey, open it up, it's locked! Come on! Get down in 'ere! Come on! (suspenseful music) Come on. A dream. You need to step on it. Let's get out of here. Let's get rich.

(gun firing) Get back here, come! Get back here! Right, give it! (gun firing) (Ron grunting) (somber music) (Wendy sobbing) - What's your name? Please, tell me your name. [sobbing] - [Officer] Recognize him? - Look what you've done. You've killed him you bastards. You didn't have to kill him. You didn't give him a chance. (Nicola sobbing) - Well, let's get it cleaned up shall we? I'll be at home if you want me. - Very good, Sir. Good night Sir. (camera clicking) - [Male] Hold it! Look at me. Look at me, this way love. - [Male] Over here, over here! - [Male] That's it, great! Keep it going. - [Male] Hold it. - [Male] This way love. - Keep it going. Look up!

And another one. - [Male] Hold it! (solemn dramatic music)
