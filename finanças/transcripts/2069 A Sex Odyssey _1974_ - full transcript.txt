Ladies and gentlemen, we’re all here to investigate one heavenly body, the remarkable Coqueta’s Comet. But it’s an elusive body. About all anyone can say is that it has curious properties that we cannot explain. It appears to have a stronger than normal attraction for heavenly bodies, often leaving its proscribed orbit and meandering around the Milky Way. Another curious phenomenon has been observed. The comet’s tail is of remarkable proportion. Oh, it’s a big one. That’s right, Miss, one of the largest ever recorded. You’ll see. And it’s thick as well. I think you will agree it’s astonishing. It might extend 100,000 kilometers. You must be exaggerating, Professor. (spaceship pulsing) Oh, Professor Comquick, look at this, there’s something else. - Well, what is it? - It’s a curious object. No, not flying saucers again. Well, it looks like a saucer. Oh, please, no more UFOs.

Naturally these primitives can’t appreciate the immense gift they possess. Many use it several times a night. Don’t the seeds ever run out? How do we get the seeds to go out? We haven’t learned. Advanced research indicates that a certain part of a man’s body appears to undergo a change. We’re working on it.

As our leading authority the professor assures us that it’s just a figment of mass imagination. Unidentified flying objects do not exist.
