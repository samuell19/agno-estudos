Bravita Blood Young. - You have summoned me. - chimaera. The time has come. Wild Witch is ready. - What do you order? - We need her blood. So I can get free. So we can take power in the whole wild world. (Fugleskræp) Hey! Stupid cat. Honestly. (Spinner) That here is a spurvehøg. It is one of the most famous Danish raptors. The species has a very tight hierarchy. Good morning, Oscar. Better late than never. For the sparrow hawk applies to the weakened isolate themselves from the pack. Otherwise expelled the and subjected to rough treatment - - the dominant. After a short time... - Yes, Oscar? - It could just fend for themselves. - It is gregarious animals like us. - But we can handle ourselves. If we are excluded, we become lonely. And if it will not be part of the pack? It shows a long-term studies of birds. It is called ornithology. You can not know what the thinking. It's dead. If one sparrow is not with his flock, then it dies. (clock) On Friday you must take your pet with. Kiki has been in the bath. I take her on Friday. So you can see how tame she has become. - Seems I also smells strange? - more obnoxious than usual? - Yes. Have you taken a shower this morning? - What do you think? - Of course. - It smells just strange. What? The cat again. - Clara, will you? - Yes. - What just happened in an hour? - Shh. He comes there. - He asks about the strangest things. - He's really creepy. - He is so annoying. - He should always discuss. As if he knows more about animals than biology-Henrik. No wonder nobody wants to hang out with him. - I think he himself has chosen it. - It makes him even more abnormal. - He always sits alone. - Who wants it? - Do you talk ever with him? - With Oscar? - Why would I? - I think he's a little crazy about you. - He's always looking at you. - It does he not at all. - Do you think? - Yes. (Smoker) Ad. - Tunsalat? - Mm. I would not eat it there. It is too old. - Not, ad! - Well, you did not eat it. How disgusting! (Bell) Oscar? - Hello, Clara. - Hi. - Are you not with Josephine? - Ha, ha. Fun. - Josephine K is not that bad. - And you're sure? We are friends. I think. - But you're my best friend. - As if. It is true. Who is your best friend? - I do not know. - Where are you string. What kind of a fog? It's really strange. One can not see anything. Nah. Oscar? Oscar! And. (echo) Her! Her! Where? (whisper) Witch Children. Come with witch children. Oscar, are you? - Witch Child. - Oscar, it's not fun. - I thought it was you. - Who? There were not any. - That was really strange, huh? - Mm. But we'll see tomorrow. - What are you about to do? - Over to my grandmother. - Should not we be home to me? - I had just forgotten. (Smoker) You are lying. You're nervous. - What do you mean? - I can smell you sweat. We are best friends, and I've never been in your home. What should I say? I'll see you tomorrow. See you. (Cat Meow) What are you doing here? Do not! Go away now. I do not play. Go away. Stop it. Of. (Murmur) (Hiss) Stupid cat. Go away. Get lost. Go away! Clara? Clara? Hey darling. What happens? What is it? - I do not know. - Clara, what happened? You boil wildly. Tell just what has happened. It was a cat that scratched me. - A cat? - Yes, such a black one. It has been worse this evening. Her temperature is 40.7. If you then just open mouth ... - What do you think it is? - Quite ordinary flu. Clara. Clara. You are the chosen one. The wild world is calling you. (Pipe) Beware. (Means ever) Hi there. I was worried when penicillin is not got the fever to fall. - Has there been anything else? - Hi. Hey darling. It is ... Isa. - It's your aunt. - Do I have an aunt? Yes. We just have not met before. - You're hurt? - I was torn by a cat. - Was it black? - Yes. Such a strange one that followed me all day. - I know it well. - Do you? - More than you think. - Isa are here just to help a little. Now you see here. I do something for you. - Drink this. - What is it? Just drink it. Otherwise, it takes a long time before the fever disappears. I still want to know what it is. The toad venom and snake saliva with willow bark and some herbs. It tastes really bad, but just drink it anyway. You can do it. And then something warm herbal tea and cold compresses, and you are fresh in the morning. Thank you for coming. - I was hoping that it was not ... - What had you imagined? - She was 12 and a half years ago. - I could not grasp it. - Call me if there is anything. - I'll do that. Thanks. - What is wrong with me? - Nothing. You get it right. - It tasted really bad. - I know. I think you should stay home from school a few days. Why do I suddenly have an aunt? It means you have a sister. Why did not you tell it? Something I would tell you. Shh. (Bravita moans) It is her. You have found wild witch. Vildheksen. I need more. I need all her blood. When I am free, we must together dominate the wild world. - What do you order? - Get hold of her. Before she even know his strength. As it may be too late. (Rallen) - Hi Mom. - Where are you going? - In school. - Is it a good idea? I'm fine. You will still not tell me what's going on. That, my aunt gave me helped. Or else it was penicillin. The doctor told you to lie ... Bye, Mom. There are not many people know, but outdoor is an active dog - - chasing the neighbor's cat. But inside is a pommeraner or pom pom, as it is called, - - calm and relaxed. I think it's the world's best pets. Thank you, Anne Katrine. Sit just down. That was exciting. Take the fun. The next is Josephine K. Come down here. Tell what your pet's name, and how long you've had it. I have taken my chinchilla with. Her name is Kiki. I've had it for about eighteen months. If a chinchilla is not tame from the start - - one must accustom it to be with someone ... It is a little lively. A little vildbasse, what '? Never ever take a chinchilla hard around the stomach. Me? Out? - Clara? - The Right Way ... Clara, do not. Sit down. Where are you going? - Clara! - Come back! Josephine. Be seated. Josephine! - What is she doing? - What are you doing down there? - Clara, what are you doing? - Now you are free. Goodbye. Clara! What do you do? What is it you have done? - Come up here immediately! - What are you doing? It said it was locked. The going out in the wild world. Kiki! Clara! Clara! Clara wind. - Clara! Where was the game! - The game? It was not as damn game. Two days ago I was normal. Now beyond me nothing. - I have to get this to go away. - Why? It's a disaster. I will be frozen out as a freak. So what? - You do not take home to me? - That is not so good today. - What are you about to do? - I'll have to slip now. Okay ... Bold friend I have. - What will you? No Redial. - Let me explain. Explain that Kiki spoke to you? Forget it! Men... Isa... I have slipped Kiki loose. It told on me, it would like. Why do I suddenly have an aunt? What are you not telling me? It is not so easy to explain. Where are you going? Over to my aunt. She is apparently the only one who can help me. (Door slams) - Stop. - Tell me what's going on. I had hoped that it would not happen. What do you mean? I believe that you are a little different than others. - I'm as much in control of it. - You do not even know where she lives. There goes well a bus. I'll take you. - Are we there yet? - Yes, we are right there. See. It says Isa and Tumpe. - Hello. - Hello. - Did not drink? - Yes, I got better. But I was unpopular at school. I let my friend chinchilla free. - The bath well with you about it. - Can not you hear, it sounds crazy? It was Josephine K's pet. I can not go back to school. - You must help me. - With what? To get it to go away. I train only wild witches who would like to be wild witches. What does she mean? I do not know what a wild witch is. You will find out. I will not be vildheks. I just want to be normal. Isa, come now. I have thought about it. I'd like your help. If there is anything ... It is only you who will. Then we'll see how it goes. We find just your thing. Came. - I love you. - I love you too. - See you. - Yes we do. Off. Hi. Tump, came. Witch Children. (Hane galer) (Animal sounds) (Prut) Not, Tumpe! (radio) (Changing channels) Good morning. Hi. Nårh. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Isa! (Remove woman song) (Female voice) And continuing. Game. - Well, Kahla. It's Clara. - Hi. Are you also here to be normal? I told you I usually only train those who want to be wild witches. Shall we get started? Go down to the house and pick nettles for dinner. - I just came up here. - Do as I say. Clara? Come on! - What with stinging nettles? - Leave them. Wild Witches helps animals. But to help them, we need to find out where they are. Use your senses to find out - - there are animals nearby who need our help. Is there anyone who is hurt? Is there anyone who has been away? It may be birds - - small rodents, hedgehogs and other small animals. So noticeable. Listen. Concentrate. (Pipe) Here! See, a baby bird. Once stirred at a young bird, its mother did not know of it. Now we have to take it home. - Try to see. - It's great, Kahla. It has turned the blade. It's probably fallen from the tree. It is 9:00 to 10:00 days old. Look there. It is a columba livia. - Hi Dad! - Hello Darling. - The Master Millaconda. - Hi. - So you're the new student? - I'm just visiting. Oh yeah. You look like your mother. - Do you know her? - Almost everyone here knows her. - Thanks for today, Kahla. - Thanks for today. - It was nice meeting you. - See you. With one hand. - What is it? - A shifts of this type. A road, wild witches can open with their senses. - Can you travel with it? - Yes, when you master his skills. - I did not think men were witches. - There is still a lot you need to learn. Should I ask Tutu to move? I'm just not used to eating with animals. Now you see here. The stinging nettle, you picked. And then there's rusty nest roots and Epipactis helleborine in the bud. Finished flowering orchids. You may like to put salt in. - Is it like the drink I got? - No. This tastes good. Here you go. - Can be eaten? - It actually tastes really good. - Is Tutu your owl? - Yes. - It's my vildven. - What is it? One that comes when you need it. Which helps you to find strength you never knew you had. - Do I have one? - Yes. It's the cat. - Is that stupid cat my vildven? - Mm. - The attacked me in the bicycle cellar. - Are you sure? - Yes. - I think it suited you. - What really happened that day? - It was a pretty weird day. In the morning came the cat after me. The afternoon was me and Oscar away in a thick fog. And there was such a creature. It looked like a black angel. Did she say anything to you? "Witch Child. Come with me." Should I be afraid of it? Not as long as you do as I say and being in the house. (Murmur) Today we train wild song. It creates contact between us wild witches and the wild world. Wild Song can both soothe the animals and attract them. The better we master a wild song, the better we can help nature. The important thing is not the song. It helps just to focus energy. Try again with your eyes closed. (Humming tone) Can you hear the sounds around you gets higher? Try sometime to sit down. Just take your time. Feel. Listen. Concentrate. Can you hear nature respond to you? (echo) (Knurren) (Loud cry) Fantastic! He came right up to you. - Um, what are you doing? - I listen to the roots. Have you always wanted to be wild witch? It's not just something you choose. You can try to hide it. But are you crazy witch, it's a vocation. - You Do not be crazy witch? - I do not really know. - I think it's a little ... - Shh. - What is it? - Shh. Just try to listen. Clara, try to see. I could hear it. It was inside the tree. Came. Then we go for a little walk. Hi. Try to make as me. (Wild song) Is it you who have taken all these? Most. This is your grandmother character. It's your mother and me, standing in the garden. - Does my mother stayed here? - Yes. When she was little. Why has not she told me that she had a sister - - and she grew up here? Since our mother died we reacted very differently. Everything in this world made her miss her mother. She decided to take off and put all this behind him. I still think it's strange she has not told about it. It does everything for a reason. Do not try to make a drawing? Yes, but I'm not very good at it. One should just try. Close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose - - down in the stomach, and exhale through the mouth. See the white paper in front of you without opening his eyes. Concentrate on paper. Remove everything else from your mind - - and see how your drawing stand out of the paper. As if it already exists. Inside you. Can you see it? Here. So open your eyes. Do you remember drawing? - Yes. - So you draw. How do I know if I do it right? If it comes from within, it is true. (Wild song) (Squawk) It's just Clara. How did it go with the drawing? I think it was crazy ugly. One should practice on everything. Whether you're talented or not. This also applies to wild witches. What is it exactly a wild witch doing? We take care of the wild world. The wild animals and wild plants. We are the wild nature guardians, you could say that. Will you take the lamp? Can you see the fence here? It's a wild protection. It surrounds the house and goes out in a large part of the wild world. You must be inside the fence until you can get by as wild witch. We move in nature. We are in contact with the various elements. Water. Land. Fire. Wood and metal. Our movements, together with wild song help us - - to communicate with nature and gather our magical powers. Becoming wild witch is to control his abilities - - and thus protect the wild, wild world. Try. It has actually been your mother. And now it is yours. It is nice. So both my mother and my grandmother loved witches? And. How did my grandmother? In a battle against the dark forces that will destroy the wild world. - Is the dark forces still? - Yes. They do. But they can not reach us when we are within my wild protection. (Barking) Mabel? Calm, Tump. It's the cat. It fits you. We ourselves are a small but important part of the wild world. When we look at nature, so it fits on us. - Why would you be a wild witch? - My mother was an accomplished wild witch. - What happened? - She disappeared. How? Wild roads are some of the strongest in the wild world. If you can not control them or evil forces affecting them - - they shall be as mazes. My mother was caught in such shifts of this type. I will look for my mother and become so skilled - - that I can make my own shifts of this type. I understand that. Come on. What are you looking at? Seriously? Nothing? (Barking) Mabel? Mabel? Isa? Mabel? Mabel? (Hylen) Dolt, is that you? What are you doing out there? (Making and whistles) We should not be there! Give! We should not be out of wild structure. Mabel? What are you looking at? Hello? Can you hear me? We shall be back. We should not be out here. Hallo? Give! Can you hear me? Clear? Clear? (Remote clock) Clara? Mabel? Give! (whisper) Who are you? Kimæra. - What will you? - Your blood. Have you always been like this? The wild world excluded me. U.S. Bravita Blood Young. But with your blood, we get it all back. (Cat Meow) (Both hiss) - Hey darling. - Hi Mom. - How are you feeling? - Fine. Has something happened with Tumpe? He'll probably clear it. Not too Tump? - Oscar? - Hello. - What are you doing here? - I heard you got into trouble. I came out here with your mother. I was also almost by ... - Are you okay? - Hold on. - What are you about to do? - I gotta get something. He. It was her. Chimaera. It was she who abducted me. She tried to kill me. Like the grandmother was killed. (Squawk) - What does it mean? - That raven mothers have a message. - Hvem? - Ravnemødrene. Wild Witches Supreme Council. Raven Mothers want to talk to us. Distinguished Valla. Distinguished Thuja. What can we do Ravn mothers Council? Our ravens tells us that chimaera has been found. She kidnapped my sister's daughter and tried to kill her. Tried... She escaped. With the help of his vildven. Where is she? The selected. The time has come. Bravita leader chimaera further into the darkness. Chimaera will set her free from the grave. With your blood. It's your job. You are the one we've been waiting for. You are the only one who can find Bravita blood Youth grave. And destroy her. If Bravita get power that she heed - - so she's going to destroy the whole wild world. - Why did not you tell it? - I did not know it. - You did not think it was important? - We should never be taken here. It's a sick idea that I must beat chimaera death. If you do not find chimaera, she finds you. We can not escape from who we are. Isa, stop. Forget it. We're going home tomorrow, honey. Those raven mothers does not therefore completely normal. The selected? I'm just going home again. I've already been away too long. What is it? Where did you get it? - And what are these wounds? - Clara, stop. It was you who was out of the tower. It was you who helped me. You're the cat. You are my vildven. Is not that right? - Clara, listen to me. - It's crazy! The old claim that I must save the world from a crazy witch. And now my best friend is also a cat. Unbelievably, I have not discovered it sooner. - That explains the quite a lot. - What do you mean? I've never been in your home. And so are you so strange. - Are you so cat or human? - Most cat. - Show it to me. - What? - How do you become the cat. - No. Are not you supposed to be my vildven? So get started. Come then. You have known what I was, all the time. You're just like them! Full of lies like the others. - Go. - What? I do not have anything to do with you. Go! Now. Okay. Are fallen out? He's not my friend. Did you know who he was? I also think you knew. Deep inside. - Sheep? - Yes. - Do you think Clara go home tomorrow? - Yes. It is probably also the best. (Wheezing) Oscar? Kimæra. (Squawk) Do you know where they went? Keep up. She is gone. Did she say anything about what happened? She said... She had fallen out with Oscar. Maybe she went out into the woods to find him and apologize. - If anything happens to her ... - She is an accomplished wild witch. I have spent so many years to put this behind me. And now I have sent her into the arms of chimaera. - That is not certain. - She is 12 years old. - You were also on the move all the time. - She is gone! Do you understand? Kahla? Kahla? Isa. Mille. Kahla is gone. Wind! Wind. Chimaera have taken my vildven. What does she know him? - What she would do to you. - Tell me what I should do. The Council requests the selected step closer. Step closer. Do you promise to protect the wild world from evil forces? And. Do you promise to protect the wild world of your own life? And do not let you take of the dark forces, that seeks your life? And. You are now in the wild witches-ed. We all use our abilities to help you. Bravitas tomb is hidden even higher against the cold north - - in the distant shifts of this type in the tip of the wild world. I love the way is no direction, no help. It's like another world. Clara. Clara. You must use your senses. Your skills. Follow them and lost the way. Then you will meet your destiny. Hi there. You're completely cold. Are you okay? Come here. (Raslen) Is there anybody? Who is it? Hi. Kahla. I thought you might need help. Yes. I can certainly. - It's a ildøgle. - I found it behind a rock. - It was quite cold. - Hi there. - Well, I think it likes you. - I certainly like you. - Where are we going? - I try to find an exit. Its far down. Now I can not see the path more. There are quite dark. (Croaking) It is ildøgler. They are all over. - They are helping us. - Thanks. - Look, there's light. - I think that is where we are going. - Where are we going? - I do not know. I just need to find her. Now I find Oscar. We try to go this way. There is smooth here. Beware. What do we do now? We can not move forward. They just said I had to find chimaera in wild road. But how do I get it up? I can not find out! (Wild song) - What are you doing? - Had you not need shifts of this type? We can of course not do. - What do we do? - I do not know. Let's try. (Wild song) I do not see any shifts of this type. Can you? No. Let's try again. (Wild song) (Nibble) Again. (Wild song increases) - Thanks. - Thank you. Came. Kahla? Stop. - Why? - You have to go back. - You can not come up with. - But Clara ... I must! Kahla Millaconda! I can not explain it, but I have to do it yourself. I must go on alone. - Promise you that does not happen you something? - I promise. Okay. - You are a skilled wild witch. - You too. - Take good care of yourself. - I'll do that. Oscar? (echo) Oscar? (Squawk) Clara. Clara. You are on the right track. - What should I do? - You must continue. Use your senses wild witch. Witch Children. Witch Children. Come with witch children. Witch Child, follow me. Come with me, witch child. - Clara! Hurry away! - She does not need you anymore. You do not need all those who say they apply to you. Your mother. Your aunt. Your so-called vildven. - They have filled you with lies. - She is lying! Clara. - Told the you who you are? - Do not listen to her! - No, did you? - What have you done? But the truth is - - that you do not need them anymore. Nor your vildven. Yes. Finally you came. It is Bravitas grave. She has waited so long for you. Bravita is the largest wild witch of them all. She becomes part of you. And you become a part of her. You will live forever. Come on. Let me taste ... ... Viridians blood. More blood. (Raucous laughter) When Bravita are free, we are all part of the wild world again. And then we take the power back from all raven mothers and wild witches. The whole wild world is ours! It is well. Do not close Bravita in. Only you can save the wild world. (Weak wild bed) Do not cry, little witch child. Do not you understand that now we take back what is ours? (Wild song) - What are you doing? - Stop! (High wild singing) Stop the witch child! (cry) (raller) Let my soul rest upon you, wild witch child. (High wild-song) Clara of Viridian's generation. So. See. Do you know this guy? - Your vildven? - Yes. - Congratulations. - Thanks. See you. - I will miss you. - You too. - Goodbye. - I'm so proud of you. Take care of it all until I come back. - Of course. Farewell, my girl. - Goodbye, aunt Isa. Oscar? (Miav) Now, there you are. I had not done it without your help. You are a good vildven. Goodbye. See you. - Oh, where is he stupid. - Yes, really stupid. - It must have been painful. - Hi. And where have you as weather her? Out to beat the crazy witch to death. - You're not normal, Clara. - No I am not. I am the wildest witch. Who does she think straight, she is? - May I sit here? - Yes. What are you reading?
