THE WEATHER'S SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY NICE THE REST OF THE WEEK. SOUNDS GOOD. YOU OKAY? I JUST MISS AUNT BETH RUNNING OUT TO HUG ME HELLO. I KNOW. UNCLE ROY'S IN THE BARN. HE'LL BE IN SOON. LET'S GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT. WELL, I HOPE MY STEAK AND EGGS LIVED UP TO YOUR MANHATTAN STANDARDS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I WOULD TAKE BREAKFAST WITH YOU OVER BRUNCH AT THE RITZ ANY DAY. WHAT'S THE RITZ? WELL, IF YOU EVER CAME TO VISIT ME IN NEW YORK, YOU WOULD KNOW. I KNOW, I KNOW. I... I PROMISE, I WILL TRY AND COME AND VISIT IN THE SPRING. OKAY. BUT YOU'RE HERE NOW, SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WHILE YOU'RE IN TOWN? HONESTLY, AS LITTLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THE ONLY THINGS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ARE THE TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY AND THE CHRISTMAS EVE PARADE. WELL, I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY TREE-LIGHTING THIS YEAR. WHAT? YEAH, AND NO CHRISTMAS PARADE EITHER, BY THE LOOKS OF IT. WHY? WITHOUT AUNT BETH, PAIGE IS STRETCHED TOO THIN AT THE CAFE TO ORGANIZE THE PARADE, AND ROY JUST DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTING WITHOUT HER. BUT THAT'S OUR TRADITION! [MAN]: IT'S ALSO A TRADITION TO HUG YOUR UNCLE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN SIX MONTHS. UNCLE ROY! [CHUCKLING] GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU! HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

LOOK, NOBODY LOVES THE CHRISTMAS PARADE MORE THAN ME, BUT I AM SWAMPED THIS YEAR WITH WORK. BESIDES, I DON'T HAVE THE CREATIVE GENIUS THAT RUNS IN YOUR FAMILY. YOU COULD PROBABLY DO IT WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED. HONESTLY, PAIGE, I CAME ON THIS VACATION BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM WORK, NOT PICK UP ANOTHER PROJECT. BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE PARADE, HOW WOULD YOU DECORATE? WELL, I WOULD DEFINITELY USE AUNT BETH'S GIANT CANDY CANES, AND THEN I WOULD TAKE THE PINE BOUGHS WITH THE RED AND GREEN LANTERNS, AND I'D PUT THEM UP OVER THERE, AND I'D GET ALL THE STOREFRONTS TO PAINT THEIR WINDOWS WITH DIFFERENT SCENES FROM THE ADVENT CALENDAR, AND THEN FOR A REAL COUNTRY CHRISTMAS FEEL, I'D USE MASON JARS WITH LIGHTS AND TWIG GARLANDS ALL ALONG THE ROUTE. -THAT'D BE PERFECT. -GO ON. OH... NO, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. NICE TRY! NO, PAIGE... I JUST WANT TO RELAX. OKAY, FINE... AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY, BUT YOU KNOW THAT THIS WAS AUNT BETH'S PRIDE AND JOY. I KNOW, BUT I JUST... I JUST SPENT THE PAST HOUR TELLING YOU ABOUT MY BROKEN HEART. WELL, THIS WILL HELP KEEP YOU BUSY AND HELP YOU FORGET MR. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME. BESIDES, YOU KNOW YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER REPLACE HER. AGH! OKAY! FINE! FINE, I WILL... I WILL DO IT, BUT I'M DOING THIS FOR AUNT BETH. OKAY, SO... THESE ARE SOME FLYERS I HAD PRINTED UP FOR THE CHRISTMAS PARADE WHEN I THOUGHT I COULD STILL DO IT. CONVENIENT. WELL, AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE THE PARADE. YOU KNOW, MY UNCLE ROY DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY THIS YEAR. YEAH, I HEARD. EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT. [SIGHS] I KNEW THIS CHRISTMAS WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

BEEN AROUND THE WORLD AT CHRISTMAS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, CHRISTMAS TIME IS... YOU KNOW, IT'S MORE OF A TIME TO BE ENDURED THAN ENJOYED... BUT, UH, LAST YEAR, I WAS IN BARBADOS, AND... NEXT YEAR? WHO KNOWS. WELL... LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BOTH HIDING OUT THIS CHRISTMAS. YEAH, LOOKS THAT WAY. [SARAH]: YOU KNOW... SINCE YOU'VE MISSED OUT ON SO MANY CHRISTMASES, SEEMS ONLY FAIR THAT YOU GET TO PICK THE TREE THIS YEAR. ME? YEAH. GO FOR IT. HUH. WHAT ABOUT... WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE? NICE NEEDLES... STRONG BRANCHES... IT'S A GOOD, DEPENDABLE TREE. I THINK WE'VE FOUND OUR TREE. Y'ALL PICKED A GREAT ONE. GRAHAM CHOSE IT. WE. WE CHOSE IT. [DOOR OPENING] WHO PUT THAT TREE IN MY LIVING ROOM? DELILAH? WAS IT YOU? NO, I JUST STOPPED BY TO DROP OFF SOME CHRISTMAS COOKIES. AND I WAS JUST STARTING THE FIRE. [SARAH]: LOOK, UNCLE ROY, I JUST WANTED TO... IT WAS MY FAULT, SIR. ALL DUE RESPECT, I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP THINGS LOW-KEY THIS YEAR, BUT I SAW THIS TREE, AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK PERFECT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM, BUT... I THINK IT WOULD LOOK EVEN MORE PERFECT IF IT WERE DECORATED. SON, YOU CAN SAVE THAT HUNDRED-DOLLAR SMILE FOR YOUR FANS. YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST GUY WHO'S TRIED TO SELL ME THE SAME HORSE TWICE... BUT... AROUND HERE, HOSPITALITY COMES WITH THE TERRITORY, SO, UH... SUIT YOURSELVES. WANT TO HELP US DECORATE? NO, I'M GOING TO TURN IN. YOU COULD FIND BETH'S ORNAMENTS IN THE CLOSET IN THE HALLWAY. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. THAT'S A LOT TO ASK OF HIM RIGHT NOW. MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL JUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE MORE TIME. SURE. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. UH-OH. I NEED HELP. LOOKS LIKE I HAVE A MOVIE STAR TO RESCUE. OH, THAT'S PRETTY. PUT IT UP? SURE. [PHONE RINGS] JOSEPHINE! MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS YOURSELF. HOW ARE THINGS IN COLORADO? ARE YOU GETTING THE R&R YOU WANTED? HAH... NOT EXACTLY, BUT I AM DOING WHAT I DO BEST... STAYING BUSY. HOW ARE THINGS BACK AT THE HOTEL? OH... YOUR LOBBY'S SUCH A HIT. JACOBS CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR NEW YEAR'S. HE WONDERED IF YOU COULD COME BACK A DAY EARLY TO GET A JUMP START? UM... I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE A PARADE TO PLAN. TELL EVERYONE AT THE HOTEL I SAY HI. BYE, JO. MORNING! MORNING. YOU'RE UP AWFULLY EARLY. READY TO HEAD DOWNTOWN AND DECORATE MAIN STREET? THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD RATHER DO THAN GO DECORATE MAIN STREET. OH. UH... WHY DO YOU HAVE A SNOWBALL IN YOUR HAND? UH, WELL, THIS WAS GOING TO BE YOUR WAKE-UP CALL IF YOU WEREN'T UP YET. SEEMS A SHAME TO WASTE SUCH A PERFECTLY GOOD SNOWBALL. REALLY? OKAY. THAT'S IT. [LAUGHING] I COULDN'T RESIST. [LAUGHING] OKAY. AH! TRUCE, TRUCE, TRUCE, TRUCE. TRUCE. OH... [SCREAMING AND LAUGHING] YOU KNOW WHAT? I CALLED A TRUCE. YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T AGREE TO IT. AND YOU SAID YOU CAN'T TRUST AN ACTOR. HI, GRAHAM. NICOLE! HI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WELL, YOU'D KNOW IF YOU EVER CHECKED YOUR PHONE, SILLY! HA. UM... THIS IS... I'M NICOLE COLLINS, GRAHAM'S CO-STAR. AND THIS IS... SARAH. IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, SARAH. PETER TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOUR RANCH. HE SAID THAT I'D BE IN VERY CAPABLE HANDS HERE. WHOA, WAIT. ARE YOU STAYING HERE? IF THAT'S OKAY. I FIGURED, SINCE WE'RE BOTH IN THE SAME FILM, I SHOULD PROBABLY LEARN ABOUT RANCH LIFE, TOO, RIGHT? YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO BE A RANCH HAND? I JUST FIGURED I'D LEARN MY LINES WITH GRAHAM AND ABSORB ALL THE ATMOSPHERE HERE... AND THEN WE CAN SPEND CHRISTMAS TOGETHER. I'VE MISSED YOU. HUH... HEH. 'KAY. [NICOLE]: YOU HAVE TO CATCH ME UP... ON EVERYTHING. YEAH. I'M JUST GOING TO... IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, SARAH. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER. YEAH, ME... ME TOO. YOU HAVE BAGS? YEAH, LOTS OF BAGS. HEY. HEY. UM... SORRY ABOUT NICOLE. I HAD NO IDEA THAT SHE WAS COMING. IT'S FINE. SHE SEEMS NICE. YEAH, SHE IS. SHE'S GREAT, BUT... GRAHAM... IT'S FINE. YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN. I'M JUST HAPPY WHEN THE GUESTS ARE HAPPY. OKAY. CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHY NICOLE COLLINS IS OUT ON OUR PORCH? SHE'S OUR NEW GUEST. ARE YOU SERIOUS? UM.... [CODY]: CAN'T SWING A LASSO WITHOUT HITTING A MOVIE STAR THESE DAYS. YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE STAYING HERE. WHY NOT? WELL, I EXPLAINED TO HER THAT YOU GUYS AREN'T REALLY OPEN. THE RANCH IS CLOSED FOR THE HOLIDAYS. I CAN HELP SHOW HER AROUND... I MEAN, ONLY IF THAT WOULD BE USEFUL. NO. NO, IT'LL BE OKAY. THANKS, THOUGH. THAT'S FINE. THERE'S AN EXTRA ROOM IN THE MAIN HOUSE. I'LL GO GET IT SET IT UP. [TYPING] HEY, YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY? OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN DOING DOUBLE-DUTY WITH GRAHAM AND THE PARADE, SO IT'S GOOD. NOW I CAN JUST FOCUS ON THE PARADE FULL-TIME. IF YOU SAY SO. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU SHOULD REALLY MAYBE TRY TAKING IT A BIT EASIER ON YOURSELF. I'M FINE. YOU SAID IT BEST. IT'S BEST FOR ME TO JUST KEEP BUSY. WELL, I CAN KEEP YOU CAFFEINATED. THANK YOU. PROMISE ME YOU'LL BE CAREFUL ON THAT LADDER. OKAY? I WILL. ♪ CHRISTMAS IS HERE AGAIN ♪ ♪ CHRISTMAS IS HERE AGAIN ♪ ♪ CHRISTMAS IS HERE AGAIN ♪ ♪ EVERYBODY'S HOME FOR CHRISTMAS ♪ ♪ CHRISTMAS IS HERE AGAIN ♪ ♪ EVERYBODY'S HOME FOR CHRISTMAS ♪ I DON'T KNOW, SARAH.

IT WAS ORIGINALLY JUST A PUBLICITY SET-UP, YOU KNOW. THEY ACTUALLY... THEY DO THAT? SURE. OUR PUBLICISTS THOUGHT WE LOOKED GOOD TOGETHER, SO WE WENT ALONG WITH IT. I WAS SURPRISED AT WHAT A NICE GUY GRAHAM WAS, BUT, UH... UNFORTUNATELY, WE'VE BOTH BEEN SO BUSY WITH OUR CAREERS, THE WHOLE THING NEVER REALLY WENT ANYWHERE. OH, YEAH? I FIGURE THIS MOVIE'S A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER AGAIN. AND YOU'VE ALL BEEN SO WELCOMING HERE. LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP. YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE ACTUALLY IS. CODY HAS ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BEING, LIKE, A STUNT GUY WHO WORKS WITH HORSES. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD... TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT? YEAH. SURE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU. YEAH. HEY. HEY, UNCLE ROY. WHAT'S ALL THIS? I JUST FIGURED IF THE HORSES WERE GOING TO BE IN THE PARADE, THEY MIGHT AS WELL LOOK THE PART. JUST LIKE YOUR AUNT-- ALWAYS FIGURING OUT A WAY TO DECORATE THINGS DIFFERENTLY. SHE WAS THE BEST AT IT. YES, SHE WAS. YOU OKAY? YEAH, FINE. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY YOU'VE BEEN WORKING YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE LATELY. THAT OBVIOUS, HUH? MM-HMM. IT'S BEEN TOUGH... WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED THIS YEAR. SEEMS LIKE AS SOON AS THINGS CALM DOWN, ANOTHER STORM MOVES IN. WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS, THERE'S ALWAYS SUNSHINE AFTER A STORM. SOMETIMES, YOU'VE JUST GOTTA BE A LITTLE BIT PATIENT. SO... HANG IN THERE, OKAY? THANKS. YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER TAKING IT EASY YOURSELF. SURE THE BARN CAN WAIT UNTIL THE NEW YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY, IT CAN'T. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OH, UM, MY AUNT BETH ALWAYS SAID THE CHRISTMAS PARADE RAN ON SWEETS. HER, UM, PEPPERMINT BARK RECIPE WAS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE. OKAY, YOU NEED TO STOP AVOIDING ME. WE NEED TO TALK. UM... JUST IF YOU'RE GOING TO STEAL, YOU'VE GOT TO HELP, SO... FINE. CAN WE TALK ABOUT NICOLE? WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT? WELL... THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOVIE RELATIONSHIPS AND REAL RELATIONSHIPS. YEAH, I KNOW. NICOLE TOLD ME IT STARTED AS A PUBLICITY STUNT. WHAT, WHAT STARTED? A RUMOR? GRAHAM, YOU'RE GOING BACK TO L.A. IN A FEW DAYS, AND I AM GOING BACK TO NEW YORK. MAYBE SO, AND MAYBE I CAME HERE TO LOSE MYSELF AT CHRISTMAS TIME, BUT I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND YOU. [NICOLE]: GRAHAM, READY TO RUN OUR SCENE? [CLEARING THROAT] HEY, NICOLE. OH, UM... I'VE GOT TO HEAD TO TOWN WHILE YOU GUYS WORK, SO... SEE YOU LATER. HEY. HEY. HELLO. CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING? HI, IS ROY AROUND? UH, NO, HE'S NOT. IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD HELP YOU WITH? UH, THAT'S OKAY. JUST HAVE HIM GIVE ME A CALL WHEN HE GETS BACK. SURE, CAN I TELL HIM WHAT IT'S ABOUT? JUST TELL HIM I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS. I HAVE A CLIENT THAT'S READY TO MAKE AN OFFER. MERRY CHRISTMAS! MERRY CHRISTMAS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN'T DO? YOU KNOW, I LOVE ROY AND CODY, BUT I'VE OFTEN IMAGINED HOW DIFFERENT THAT RANCH WOULD LOOK IF YOU EVER DECIDED TO RETURN HOME. PAIGE, YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT. MY LIFE IS IN NEW YORK NOW. I KNOW, BUT A GIRL CAN DREAM, RIGHT? HOW IS THAT MOVIE STAR? ANY CHRISTMAS MAGIC BETWEEN YOU TWO? I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT GRAHAM. I HAVE ENOUGH GOING ON. BESIDES, WHO WANTS TO BE WITH AN ACTOR, RIGHT? I MEAN, THEY'RE ENTITLED, AND HAVE TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT, AND THEY ARE ALWAYS LEAVING. SO HE IS GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION? NO. I MEAN, IN A WEEK, WE'LL BE 3,000 MILES APART, AND WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN. OKAY, THAT'S OPTIMISTIC. NO, IT'S REALISTIC... AND BESIDES, HE'S GOT THIS, YOU KNOW, GORGEOUS HOLLYWOOD CO-STAR. SHE FOLLOWED HIM ALL THE WAY OUT HERE. SHE'D... SHE'D PROBABLY MARRY HIM IN A HEARTBEAT. OKAY, NOW, SARAH, YOU'RE JUST MAKING ASSUMPTIONS. NO, PAIGE. I'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE, AND I AM NOT DOING IT AGAIN. YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU CAME HERE TO HIDE OUT WHILE THINGS SETTLED DOWN, AND I AM REALLY GLAD YOU DID, BUT AT SOME POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO REALIZE THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIDING OUT, AND JUST PLAIN HIDING. MORNING. MORNING! SLEEP WELL? YEAH. UM... SO, UNCLE ROY, A REAL ESTATE AGENT STOPPED BY LAST NIGHT. JENNY SOMEONE? WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE SAID SHE HAS AN OFFER FOR YOU. ARE YOU GOING TO SELL THE RANCH? IS THAT WHY YOU'RE MAKING A NEW BARN? WELL, NOTHING'S FINAL YET, BUT THINGS CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS MUCH LONGER. BUT WHY? I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING OKAY. WELL, I... I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO RUN THIS PLACE ANYMORE, AND IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME WITHOUT YOUR AUNT. WE ALL MISS HER, UNCLE ROY, BUT, HECK, I'LL HELP YOU RUN THE RANCH. I'VE PRETTY MUCH BEEN DOING IT ANYWAY. YES, YES, YOU HAVE, AND YOU'RE STARTING TO RESENT IT. NAH... NO, DON'T DENY IT. ANYBODY CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE ITCHING TO GET OUT THERE INTO THE WORLD. -YES, BUT I... -AND SARAH-- YOU'RE HEADING BACK TO MANHATTAN SOON, SO... BUT UNCLE ROY, THIS IS OUR HOME. NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT, HONEY, I DO... AND WHEREVER I END UP, THAT'LL BE YOUR HOME, TOO. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE WELCOME, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PLACE IS GETTING MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE, AND, I MEAN, WE BARELY BROKE EVEN THE LAST TWO YEARS. YEAH, BUT... THERE'S NO BUTS ABOUT IT! THERE'S NO BUTS ABOUT IT. THIS PLACE'LL TAKE EVERY CHOICE YOU GUYS HAVE IN LIFE, AND IT'S GOING TO WHITTLE IT DOWN TO JUST ONE, AND I DON'T WANT TO SADDLE EITHER OF YOU WITH THAT. OKAY? NOW, LOOK, LIKE IT OR NOT, WE GOT GUESTS HERE, SO LET'S GIVE THEM THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY EXPECT. OKAY? WHAT DO YOU THINK, NICOLE? NICE RIDING, GRAHAM! YOU BOTH LOOK GREAT. ANYWAY, I'VE GOT TO HEAD INTO TOWN ON SOME OFFICIAL PARADE BUSINESS, SO... I'M GOING TO GO WITH YOU, HANG ON. UH, I DON'T NEED ANY HELP. ALL RIGHT, TOO BAD. UH... YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME. FINE. I JUST HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE LOCAL RADIO STATION AND TALK ABOUT THE PARADE AND BEG FOR MORE VOLUNTEERS, 'CAUSE WE PROBABLY NEED ABOUT TWO DOZEN MORE ON THE DAY. OKAY, WELL, IF YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU TO THE RADIO STATION, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DO A LITTLE PRESS HERE AND THERE. I THINK I CAN HANDLE THE LOCAL DJ. OKAY. BUT IF YOU INSIST ON HELPING, YOU COULD RUN TO THE STORE FOR ME AND PICK UP SOME MORE RIBBON FOR THE WREATHS. WOULD BE MY PLEASURE, MA'AM. [ENGINE STARTING] I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT LIFE ON A RANCH. AFTER ALL THE WORK'S DONE AROUND HERE, DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT TO DO. YEAH, CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU THERE. I COULD TAKE YOU INTO TOWN LATER, IF YOU PREFER... OR... I COULD SHOW YOU HOW WE DO CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS ON A RANCH. YOU TAKE ONE OF THESE, JUST ADD A LITTLE GREEN AND RED PAINT, A SNOWFLAKE, SOME MISTLETOE, HANG IT ON THE FIREPLACE, GOT YOURSELF A CHRISTMAS COUNTRY STOCKING. THAT IS ADORABLE! YEAH, YOU GET CREATIVE WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE AS MUCH AS I AM. SARAH SAID YOU'RE QUITE THE MOVIE BUFF. WESTERN FILMS, MOSTLY. SHE ALSO MENTIONED YOU WERE INTERESTED IN MAYBE DOING SOME STUNT WORK ONE DAY? THAT'S SILLY, I KNOW. I'VE ALWAYS HAD A DREAM OF WORKING IN THE MOVIES. I ALMOST MOVED TO CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR, AND THEN AUNT BETH GOT SICK, AND, YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T LEAVE THEN. SINCE SHE PASSED, ROY'S NEEDED ME AROUND HERE MORE THAN EVER, SO HERE I AM. SORRY, CODY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. NOW THAT ROY'S DETERMINED TO SELL THE RANCH, I MIGHT GET MY CHANCE SOONER THAN I THINK. IF YOU DO MAKE IT TO L.A., I COULD INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR STUNT COORDINATOR. REALLY? THAT'S... THANK YOU, NICOLE. AND WITH CHRISTMAS IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, ROCK CREEK'S ANNUAL PARADE IS BACK ON, AND A NEW ORGANIZER THIS YEAR, SARAH MCKINNEY, IS HERE WITH US TO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT. HI, SARAH. HI! UM, YES, THE PARADE IS DEFINITELY BACK ON, AND IT IS VERY SPECIAL FOR ME THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE'LL BE HAVING IT IN HONOR OF MY AUNT BETH, WHO WAS THE ORGANIZER FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR, WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED FOR VOLUNTEERS, SO IF ANYONE OUT THERE IS INTERESTED, YOU CAN GO DOWN TO THE HARVEST CAFE AND ASK FOR PAIGE. AND WHO'S GOING TO BE MARCHING THIS YEAR? WELL, WE HAVE THE, UH... THE HIGH SCHOOL BAND, AND, UM... THE ROTARY CLUB, AND SOME PEOPLE FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. ANY FLOATS? MY KIDS JUST LOVE THOSE FLOATS. YEAH, WELL, WE GOT A BIT OF A LATE START THIS YEAR, SO, UM, WE HAVEN'T MADE AN OFFICIAL DECISION ABOUT THE FLOATS YET. WORD AROUND TOWN IS THAT AFTERWARDS, THERE WON'T BE A TREE-LIGHTING AT YOUR FAMILY RANCH THIS YEAR? UM, NO, BUT, UM... WE'RE-- WE'RE STILL HOPING FOR A GREAT TURNOUT, AND, UH... UM... UH...

[LAUGHING] AND THERE ARE TEN MORE JUST LIKE 'EM. WOW. [CODY]: SO YOU COMING, SARAH? COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE OUT OF EXCUSES. LET'S GO. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THIS. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. HONESTLY, AT FIRST, I WAS A LITTLE OVERWHELMED, BUT THEN I STARTED THINKING OF IT AS ONE BIG HOTEL LOBBY TO DECORATE. YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB. WOW... SNOWMEN! I HAVEN'T BUILT ONE SINCE I WAS A KID. WE SHOULD JOIN IN! SURE, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE MISSED THE DEADLINE. [NICOLE]: MM... HANG ON. [LAUGHING] WHAT IS SHE DOING? NICOLE HAS A WAY OF WINNING PEOPLE OVER. SHE'S GOOD AT USING THE CHARM CARD. RIGHT, AND YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT. WHO, ME? C'MON GUYS! LET'S BUILD A SNOWMAN! SEE? -THANK YOU! -THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. I HAVE TO SAY, YOU ARE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS FOR A CALIFORNIA BOY. WELL, I HOPE SO. YOU KNOW, I... I TOOK A SCULPTING CLASS FOR THIS FILM I SHOT A FEW YEARS AGO, SO IT'S... IT'S FINALLY PAYING OFF. SURE SEEMS LIKE THINGS COME EASY TO YOU. YEAH? IS THAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE? EVERYTHING THAT I'VE EVER REALLY CARED ABOUT, I HAD TO WORK PRETTY HARD FOR. YOU KNOW, LIKE MY CAREER. SO I WENT FROM DOING CAR COMMERCIALS TO GUEST SPOTS ON TV TO FEATURE FILMS... WHAT? AND THEN... [CLEARING THROAT] OF COURSE... THERE'S YOU. YOU GUYS ALMOST DONE OVER THERE? [CODY]: UNCLE ROY JUST TEXTED. DELILAH CAME OVER, AND SHE'S NOT LEAVING UNTIL WE ALL HEAD HOME AND JOIN THEM FOR HOT COCOA. WELL THEN, SHOOT. LET'S GO. THERE YOU GO. CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS, OLD WEST STYLE... I LOVE THEM!

THAT'S NOT THE ONLY GOOD NEWS. NICOLE PUT A CALL IN TO HER PRODUCER, AND GOT ME A JOB ON THE FILM. CODY, THAT'S AMAZING! [DELILAH]: CONGRATULATIONS! LOOKING AT THE NEW ASSISTANT STUNT COORDINATOR. I'LL HELP WRANGLE THE HORSES. I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, CODY. THANK YOU. IT'S A START. AND SARAH, YOU GO BACK TO NEW YORK NEXT WEEK, RIGHT? YEAH, THERE ARE A DOZEN HOTEL LOBBIES EAGERLY AWAITING THEIR NEW YEAR'S EVE MAKEOVERS. CANVASES AWAITING AN ARTIST. AND GRAHAM AND I WILL BE BACK IN L.A., REHEARSING FOR OUR NEW MOVIE.

[CODY]: QUITE WELL, I'LL ADD. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THE CHRISTMAS PARADE IS HAPPENING. WE PULLED IT OFF. I KNOW! I MEAN, I WISH WE WERE DOING THE TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY, BUT... AT LEAST WE HAVE THE PARADE. HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR AS GRAND MARSHAL? SOMETHING VERY CHRISTMAS-Y. THAT'S MY THOUGHT EXACTLY. [CELL PHONE RINGING] HANG ON A SECOND. I'VE GOT TO GET THIS. JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND. HEY. HEY, PETER. HOW YOU DOING? COLD! I'M IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S UP? WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU BETTER START PACKING, BUDDY.

NO, NO, NO, NO. NO CAN DO, BUDDY. THEY NEED YOU GUYS THERE TOMORROW. ALL RIGHT, THE STUDIO IS HOSTIG A CHRISTMAS PARTY ON THE LOT. MARKETING NEEDS YOU THERE. THEY'RE TURNING IT INTO A HUGE PRESS JUNKET, SO, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO SEE YOU AND NICOLE, WALKING ARM-IN-ARM. SO, UH, BETTER COME HOME, COWBOY. [KNOCKING] NICOLE, HI. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU. CODY IS OVER THE MOON. HEY, IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO. OH, ARE YOU PACKING ALREADY? YEAH, I'M HEADED BACK TO L.A. TOMORROW, UNFORTUNATELY. -OH. -PETER CALLED, AND THE STUDIO NEEDS US THERE FOR A PRESS EVENT TOMORROW NIGHT. GRAHAM'S NOT GOING, RIGHT? HE IS. WHEN THE STUDIO HEAD SAYS JUMP, THE RIGHT RESPONSE IS, "HOW HIGH?" HE JUST... HE HADN'T SAID ANYTHING. OH... WELL, I'M SURE HE'S GOING TO TELL YOU. YEAH. GOOD NIGHT. BYE. [SARAH]: UNCLE ROY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE? OH, JUST OUT FOR MY EVENING STRETCH. YOU? I... WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW FOOLISH I'VE BEEN. GRAHAM'S LEAVING. HE'S GOING BACK TO L.A. WELL... I WOULDN'T JUDGE HIM TOO HARSHLY. HE SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HEART. I WISH I COULD BE AS FORGIVING AS YOU. WELL... IT'S NOT ALWAYS A QUESTION OF FORGIVENESS. IT'S JUST ACCEPTING FOLKS FOR WHO THEY ARE. I KNOW. IT'S MY MISTAKE MORE THAN HIS. IT WAS TOO SOON FOR ME TO START SOMETHING WITH SOMEONE NEW. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FOAL THAT YOUR AUNT RAISED? IT WAS BORN THREE WEEKS TOO EARLY. IT COULD BARELY STAND. YEAH. THE VET SAID, "DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED..." BUT BETH SPENT EVERY WAKING MINUTE WITH THAT ANIMAL... MADE SURE THAT IT WAS WELL-FED AND WARM. I THINK SHE STAYED IN THAT BARN FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS! NOW, THAT LITTLE FOAL IS A VERY BIG, HEALTHY HORSE, AND YOUR AUNT'S THE ONE WHO'S GONE. YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT, HONEY, THAT... THINGS COME AND GO. BEST WE CAN DO IS JUST ENJOY THEM WHILE THEY'RE HERE. IT'S JUST SO HARD TO MAKE SENSE OF IT SOMETIMES. IT IS... BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS... TOMORROW IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN TODAY. WELL, HOPEFULLY, OUR CHRISTMAS PARADE WILL PUT SOME SMILES ON PEOPLE'S FACES. I THINK IT ALREADY HAS. [CHUCKLING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] SORRY. IT'S PROBABLY MY BOSS. HE DOESN'T SLEEP. [PICKING UP] GOOD NIGHT, UNCLE ROY. GOOD NIGHT, HONEY. MR. JACOBS? MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU, SIR. NICE WORK. HA! LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE REALLY CAUGHT THE CHRISTMAS BUG, HUH? I THINK SO. VOILA . MAYBE YOU CAN SHOW ME HOW TO DO THAT WHEN WE'RE ON LOCATION. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT I CAN. I'LL BE AN EXPERT BY THE TIME WE START SHOOTING. [LAUGHING] GRAHAM... I WANT TO APOLOGIZE. FOR WHAT? FOR NOT SEEING THINGS MORE CLEARLY BEFORE. LOOK, I GET IT. DESPITE OUR HEADLINES, YOU AND I... WE WEREN'T MEANT TO BE... AND I HAVE TO ADMIT, SARAH'S PRETTY GREAT. I CAN SEE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER. IT'S THAT OBVIOUS, HUH? WELL, YOU'RE NOT THAT GREAT OF AN ACTOR. OH, OUCH. HEY... WE'RE STILL FRIENDS? WE BETTER BE. WE HAVE TO SPEND THREE MONTHS ON LOCATION TOGETHER. HEY, YEAH, WE DO. HEY? THANK YOU. HEY, SARAH... I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. WERE YOU GOING TO LET ME KNOW YOU WERE LEAVING? NICOLE TOLD ME. HOLD ON... HOLD ON, SARAH. IT'S FINE. I KNOW YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES BACK IN L.A. SARAH... I KNEW WE'D HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE SOONER OR LATER. IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SOONER, RIGHT? IT WOULD NEVER WORK OUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. YOUR... LIFE IS IN LOS ANGELES, AND... I HAVE TO HEAD BACK EAST. LOOK, I TRAINED YOU HOW TO BE A RANCH HAND, RIGHT? SO YOU'RE READY FOR YOUR MOVIE, AND... YOU HELPED ME OUT WITH THE PARADE, SO... YOU HELD UP YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN. IT'S DONE. WHAT'S DONE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE DEAL'S DONE. GOOD LUCK IN L.A. UNCLE ROY? IT'S SO EARLY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP? I COULDN'T SLEEP. ME NEITHER. SO I CAME DOWN, AND I STARTED LOOKING AT THESE. OH... ALL OUR OLD CHRISTMASES HERE? [ROY]: MM-HMM. [SARAH]: REMEMBER THAT ONE? YES, I DO. I'M GOING TO MISS THIS PLACE SO MUCH. YEP. A LOT OF WONDERFUL MEMORIES. [SARAH]: I KNOW, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO, IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME TO ASK YOU TO HOLD ON TO THE RANCH, IF I'M GOING BACK TO NEW YORK, AND CODY'S MOVING TO L.A... BUT TONIGHT'S CHRISTMAS EVE. IT'S PROBABLY OUR LAST ONE HERE, SO... AND? AND I THINK WE SHOULD LIGHT THIS PLACE UP AS MUCH AS AUNT BETH EVER DID. I MEAN, SHE WAS SO PROUD OF THIS PLACE. WOULDN'T SHE WANT US TO SHOW IT OFF AND DECORATE THAT TREE ONE LAST TIME? AW, HONEY, THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN EVER DO THAT. WELL, WE COULD TRY. WELL... IN THAT CASE... WE'D BETTER WAKE UP CODY AND SEE WHAT DELILAH'S UP TO. I LOVE YOU, UNCLE ROY. I LOVE YOU BACK. HEADING OUT TO THE AIRPORT, HUH? YEAH. JUST WAITING FOR THE CAB TO SHOW UP. UH-HUH. ANY CHANCE YOU COULD STICK AROUND 'TIL AFTER CHRISTMAS? UNFORTUNATELY, I'VE GOT TO BE BACK IN L.A. TONIGHT. SARAH MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR THAT SHE WANTS ME TO GO, SO... YOU KNOW... I WAS IN A SITUATION NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN YOURS BACK WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE. I WAS AT A TRAIN STATION, HEADING HOME FROM CHICAGO. SO I WENT AND BOUGHT MY TICKET, SAT DOWN ON A BENCH TO WAIT FOR THE TRAIN, AND, UH... THIS AMAZING GIRL SAT DOWN NEXT TO ME. [CHUCKLING] WELL, WE STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION. IT TURNS OUT WE HAD A WHOLE LOT IN COMMON. WE TALKED FOR HOURS. AND? AND... TURNS OUT, I MISSED MY TRAIN. [LAUGHING] WASTED A TICKET, TOO... BUT WHAT I GOT BACK... WAS A WONDERFUL LIFE. MATTER OF FACT, I STILL GOT THAT TICKET. KEPT IT ALL THESE YEARS. IT'S MY LITTLE REMINDER NOT TO LET LIFE PASS ME BY. MAY I? I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE PULLED THIS OUT A LOT SOONER, BUT, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NEVER TOO LATE... FOR ANY OF US. YOU HAVE A GOOD FLIGHT. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. WE MIGHT BE UP AGAINST THE CLOCK, BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS THE BEST TREE-LIGHTING CEREMONY EVER! CODY, THE DECORATIONS AND THE LIGHTS ARE OUT IN THE BARN. I HATE TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS, BUT IT USUALLY TAKES DAYS TO GET THE TREE UP PROPERLY. HE'S RIGHT. WELL THEN, WE'D BETTER GET GOING! THAT TREE AIN'T GOING TO DECORATE ITSELF. DELILAH, CALL AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN. WE'RE GOING TO NEED HELP. I'M GOING TO PUT A PHONE CALL IN TO THE RADIO STATION, TOO. COME ON! LET'S GO! DO YOU THINK I COULD LEND A HAND? I THOUGHT YOU'D LEFT. NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET RID OF ME THAT EASY. BUT... I'M HERE. I'M HERE FOR THE PARADE. I'M HERE FOR THE TREE-LIGHTING. I'M HERE FOR YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. BUT I DO. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU... AND BESIDES, A RANCH HAND DOESN'T LEAVE A JOB HALF-FINISHED. WHAT ABOUT NICOLE? THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING BETWEEN ME AND NICOLE. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THAT. TRUST AN ACTOR? COME ON. EVERYONE, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP LOOKING AT AUNT BETH'S OLD PHOTO ALBUMS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET AS MANY OF HER PERSONAL TOUCHES AS POSSIBLE. WHO KNEW A MOVIE STAR COULD CLIMB LIKE THAT? HOW ARE WE DOING FOR TIME? WELL, WE'RE CUTTING IT CLOSE, BUT I THINK WE'LL MAKE IT. [PAIGE]: WELL, I CLOSED DOWN THE CAFE, AND MY STAFF SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE TO HELP. OH, HEY! SARAH, CAN I GET ONE MORE? I JUST WANTED TO MAKE MY AUNT BETH PROUD. WELL, YOU DID. I THINK YOU DID. LOOKS AMAZING. THANK YOU. [TEXT ALERT CHIMES] I'M SORRY. UM, THE PARADE STARTS IN AN HOUR, SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY-- IT'S PETER. DO YOU NEED TO GET THAT? NO. NO. I'LL CALL HIM BACK. [THUNDER RUMBLING] WOW. I HOPE IT DOESN'T RAIN ON THE PARADE.

YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S LOOKING FOR A RANCH HAND? DEPENDS. DOES HE HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE? YEAH, HE'S GOT SEVEN DAYS ON THE BEST RANCH IN COLORADO. I THINK I COULD USE SOMEONE LIKE THAT. SEE, I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD SAY THAT.
