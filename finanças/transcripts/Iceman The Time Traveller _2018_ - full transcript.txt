Time passes. Seasons change. What actually is 'time'? If we could control time - travel back and forth, could we then change fate and rewrite history? Mankind has always explored this riddle of time Scientists discovered that time is actually speed If we could master the secrets of speed, then we could control time And thus control the past and the future Man devised technology to break the sound barrier But even faster than sound - is light And so, we wait to see how light-speed can be broken Will such future technology be rockets and spaceships? Or will it just be a program developed on the internet? Remains of ancient civilizations actually show us some did traverse space-time came to this world Mysteries of the ancients the pyramids, the heads on Easter Island, or the still-unexplained Mayan civilization And sages who could predict the future, were they cosmic travelers who held the secrets to space-time? I can tell you now There really were those who became time travelers. Because I am one of them Back then, the Ming empire was formidable I was one of the Emperor's elite guard I was born in 1591 When I was ten, Nurhaci united the Manchu banners, the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci came to China I was drafted into the imperial court, away from Taoyuan village and my people Away from my people I was then placed into a training camp for the elite guard. Training was arduous, but that's how I met the friends who'd die for each other Can you do it? Yes, we can! He Ying, what do you want do when you grow up? Me? I'm gonna be a real man - a servant of the court and a good son - That's it? - Yep. What about you? I'll do something big so I don't waste the skills I've learned And you, Niehu? What's your dream? I want to marry a beautiful wife You wish Dream on What about you, Sao? Me? Let me think I want a giant chicken leg, a drumstick so big, I'll never finish it You're hopeless! It's always about food! "1624 AD" The four of us were sent out west I never expected that expedition would change my life Shall we? Let's go! I met a holy monk He bestowed on me the secret to time travel Can you swear on your life that you will never reveal the chant that starts the orb? That monk had me deliver the orb to the capital But the Emperor was young and neglected his duties I don't think we should give him the Linga For the sake of the people, I will forever guard the the orb's secret Deceiving the Emperor could cost your head For you Alright This almost cost me my life four hundred years later That was a catastrophe Or should I call it a conspiracy From the western reaches, I bring back this sacred orb! Long live the Emperor! Please slow down, Your Highness This western campaign has wrought great rewards, but why has General He Ying not returned? Eunuch Wei, Japanese pirates and Jurchen forces lurk at our borders Generals He and Sao received word en route and voluntarily set off to fight them That pleases me greatly Especially this golden orb It is the work of the gods Put it in the treasure stores so that I can toy with it! General Yuanlong, is there some way to operate this orb? It requires something called a Linga. He Ying has it This orb has the power to alter time and space Are you telling me everything? As your ally, I of course would conceal nothing But you are destined to suffer great calamity What calamity? Life becomes death. Death becomes life. In three cycles By Heaven's authority, the Emperor decrees He Ying has failed him, colluding with pirates, and slaughtering Justice Minister Du's entire family I have been honest and true all my life I could not possibly commit such murders! The Emperor has ordered your whole clan's execution! That was the avalanche that buried us When we awoke, it was to a world hundreds of years later "Route 3, Hong Kong" An illicit businessman smuggling national treasures brought Niehu, Sao, and me down to Hong Kong I met many strange people They said I was from the past At first, I couldn't believe it But everything here was so unimaginable, it wasn't a matter of believing Luckily, she was at my side, helping me understand what to me was a totally unfamiliar world of the future And yet I never expected that my three best friends would be here as well Four hundred years later, they still believed I was an ungrateful traitor who abandoned the Ming empire Even more unexpected was that their pursuit would paralyze all of Hong Kong And that is how I fell into the sea At that moment, I thought I had left the world for good Thus is your fate and thus is the test Heaven hath given Should you pass this adversity, you will reach another plane Inspector! Inspector! About the chaos at the bridge caused by the strange men, does the police have any comment? Can you tell us anything? sir, we got the one from the ocean and took him to the morgue Be right there There's another one held in solitary I just checked. He still has a pulse Niehu Boss! Eat something If everything you say is true, then I say write a book Write it all down. It ought to do better than that Palace series - He's still alive. - What do you mean? I have to find him Where would you look? Police are still investigating the bizarre events at the bridge, but have declined further comment The deputy inspector of this case has been missing for several days and is a suspect in an officer's death in the morgue Police have ordered his arrest Sao isn't important to us Only He Ying knows the chant Help me find the orb. It's the only way back Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine Yuanlong would be the one to save me The execution of the Minister's family was really a setup My brothers finally realized they had me all wrong But with all of Hong Kong looking for me, I had to completely change my look To save my mother and my village, I had to change history But first I needed to find May She had to be worried about me So he got here before you did and now he's even some kind of assistant police chief? If he hadn't intervened to save me, I would've been a goner Hey, you cut your hair That's right, I did Because I needed a fresh start May, I really must thank you for looking after me all this time Oh, you noticed So what are your plans? Actually...I came to say goodbye You're going back to the Ming era? How is that possible? Yuanlong found the orb! He found the orb! Hey, why don't we take a selfie? The times have moved on The old hutongs are all gone Now they're all these strange, tall buildings Let me use your phone You have friends in Beijing? How could I have friends in a place like this? But I've got one in Hong Kong "At the capital, don't worry" The Emperor was young and Eunuch Wei ran amok He died after a six year reign Chongzhen ascended. He fought the tide, but the dynasty was doomed This is the Ming Mausoleum Thirteen of the Emperors are buried here "A country falls, the land remains. The city in spring, green grows thick" Look at the Forbidden City of today Back then, no one could enter Now, anyone who buys a ticket can go in How were you able to find the orb in the palace? It was in the northwest treasure room all along At the end of the Qing dynasty, a great fire struck the treasure stores Eunuchs smuggled it out during the chaos It's been out among the people, ever since You and He Ying owe your trip to Hong Kong entirely to these guys Mister Deng! Mister high-level, Hong Kong, fugitive cop! "Beijing welcomes you!" Beijing is your turf. You've got your ways That thing from last time - did you do it? When I'm on the case, you can relax Here you go That's where it is Even a fighter as talented as Yuan Chengzhi at last had to flee far away The fall of the Ming dynasty was a foregone conclusion Where's Niehu? Dealing with something in town He'll meet back with us later at the cave Wow, truly a divine creation Hundreds of years and yet still flawless How is it activated? The orb is made of two companion parts With the Linga inserted and the chant spoken, it should start working Do you still remember the chant? Of course Then there's no time to lose The four of us were trapped in ice for centuries If we leave, we should leave together If it can really make time travel possible, we can go first, then come back for them No way Defying nature cannot be taken so lightly We're out of time - Boss! - There he is I'm here. Let's go Where's Sao? He Ying, Hong Kong police found Sao's body yesterday He's not coming back with us What? He's dead? Enough waiting. There's no more time Yuanlong! ls Sao dead? He's gone! What are you waiting for? If he's dead, I still want to see the body! Everyone is looking for the three of us! This is the modern world. We can't stay here! You want to go back to Hong Kong to see the girl, right? What was that? May! Had you worked with me, He Ying! I wouldn't have resorted to this - We're brothers - You're naive, He Ying Since we found the device we should make good use of it I've waited eighteen years, just for this day With this orb, the world is mine I have no words Tell me what the chant is or I shoot her dead The chant! The chant, spit it out! God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... I'm going, too! You can stay. See you later! You okay? Let's go Well, we can't get out Hey, why did you come out here? Back home, the news said they found one of you I was so worried about you Today, two fishermen discovered a bloated body out on the Gold Coast. The dead man's identity is unclear Police have not yet commented on the matter "Come to the capital, quickly" Niehu captured me I didn't expect to see you here I've brought you trouble yet again No. I'm the one who brought it to you If not for me, you wouldn't have used the chant to start the orb Damn you! I'm sorry I may not have a job or even any family, but since the day we met, I haven't regret a thing Truly no regrets? Then that's a good thing Come see that? Never give up hope LINGA is over there God mandates the Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates the Bodhisattva... Let me help you Get up This is an inspection! What's going on? Looks like they mean business Don't make them angry Oh no! Excuse me, what year is it? The sixteenth year of the Republic He Ying! We arrived in the 'Republic'. - You know it? - The Republic? - When was the Republic? - After the Ming That's them! What do you want! None of your business! Grab them! stay out of this! Don't give it to them! Take her away! Down with warmongers! How dare you! Let her go! Down with warmongers! Jap bastards strutting on Chinese soil Hand it over! in broad daylight?! I will not stand for this! I'm gonna kill you! Attacking a woman? I'll murder you! Die! Okay, that's enough Jap bastard Bring backup! Outta the way! Don't be frightened You could take on ten of them Bring it on! Let's get her! Get out of China! Quit staring! Let's get out of here! This is from the Japanese Prime Minister It details a plan for their emperor Brave young people risked their lives to steal it We were tasked to bring it back and alert everyone, so they might stand and fight Japan You two are the real heroes Allow me to pay you my respect We would be honored to know your names Yes, everyone should know of your decency We are... visitors Take care It was through a freak set of circumstances that this trip took us back to 1927 The document they guarded was the Tanaka Plan, It advised their emperor that conquering the world meant conquering China To take China, they must first take Manchuria The exposure of this document delayed Japanese invasion by ten years Let's go! Holy monk...why are you here? Seasons depart and return. Finally, so have you How do I save my people? Once the major planets align, your life will see its greatest change Cause and effect Those hang upon you now No matter the price, I will pay it to save my family Behind you are two roads back to your village One on the left, the other on the right Note well: as paths differ, so do outcomes Do I go to the left or... to the right? He Ying! Where are you? May! He Ying, where are we now? We're back in the Ming Really? Get on. We're going to Tao Yuan village Desolation abounds The corrupt hold power. Thieves run rampant What's your plan? A man of character must do four things First, we must protect our land, our households, our brothers, and our women and children Then my conscience will be clear Halt! Hold it! Who goes there! It's He Ying! Oh, He Ying! He Ying! Da Zhi, I'm so happy Brother He, your hair... I went out west Men out there all wear it like this Pretty convenient! It's so good you're back He Ying's come back! He Ying has come back! Everyone! He Ying has come back! Brother He! He's returned! My son! Look out, look out! How have you been? - Son! - Mom! You're finally back! I am It's so good to have you back You've been gone ten years Son, why does it seem like you've changed so much? Yeah, his...his hair Right, let me explain The westerners like the convenience. Out w-w-west. Look, Jade's been so worried for your return that she's thought of nothing else Long time no see. Brother He! Stand a little closer! Don't be embarrassed You're no strangers And this is? Ah. May... This is Miss May Say hello How do you do, auntie Welcome to our village, Miss May Yes, welcome! So tonight, let's all make dumplings!

Un What are you doing here? We want to see your challenger Yeah Watch your tongue - Hi - Hello What's this? Oh, my bag it has things I normally use Wow, what is this stuff? What's this for?

Dumplings are best with vinegar, soy, and sesame oil He Ying told me the same thing, too That's right Everyone let's raise our drinks and give He Ying a proper welcome! - Let's drink! - Bottoms up! Don't drink so much Over here It's okay, steady now Don't worry Miss May, you can take the bed tonight That's okay I'll be fine over here. It's nice It's alright, come I promised He Ying I'd take good care of you When I have things on my mind and can't sleep, I eat this Oh...you try some Thank you It's delicious. What's it called? Um...the future The future? The future is so sweet. It's delicious The future is sweet And one day, the future will be finished With all in disarray, the Ming dynasty could not last To prevent my village from being destroyed, I'd have to follow Yuan Chengzhi's example and take my people out west as soon as possible Ever thought you might sit there one day? Impossible. That's the Emperor's throne We were able to go 400 years back into the past How couldn't it be possible? As long as we make good use of the orb, the world will belong to us Everything in the universe, for all time, is soon in our grasp But He Ying still has the Linga that activates it He'll be back for sure to save his village I grew up here I wouldn't want to leave, and at some point I'd need to settle down Good Jade, she's been hoping for that Here I drink to you, brother-in-law Da Zhi, there's something... I want to discuss with you, the village leader If I can call you brother then say what you have to say Here goes I want to take everyone in the village And move them. To someplace far away! You're drunk Listen to me You're really drunk! Our whole village is soon going to be executed! Executed? We haven't done anything wrong why would we be executed? You're drunk. Really drunk I'm not listening to your nonsense I'm leaving. You go sleep it off. I'm going there to keep watch Da Zhi! - Yeah, yeah, stop calling my name - Hey! Listen to me! How does it feel? It's really damp Hey, not so loud Could you... tell me how you met He Ying? Yeah I used to work at a bar Wait, no. I worked at a winery Bad people would always come Luckily, He Ying came to the rescue Yeah, that's just the kind of heroic thing that only our He Ying is able to do Then how is it you came back here together? You're not thinking of stealing him, are you? Quiet, you. Our Jade is so gentle and true, He Ying, would never fall for someone else Tao Yuan celebrates Chuan and Hua Niu! Bow to Heaven and Earth! Now to your parents! Ladies and gentlemen! On this happy day for Hua Niu and me, I stand here and drink to you all! Chuan! Sao? Hey, Sao came back! Sao is back, too? You've finally come back! When I heard you were getting married, I took leave Didn't expect to be late and miss the formalities So it didn't count. Do it over! Go on, do it over! Ah, it's great you're back. Let's drink! He Ying! Brother He! What a guy. How did you get here before me? Do you like Hong Kong? - Gong gong? - No No, it's a foreign tongue. From the west. It means I really missed you I missed you, too, brother! Drink up, come on! Sao... Not an easy thing rushing back from so far off You know it, brother Actually, I came back together with Minister Du Minister Du? He expressly wanted me to invite you to a feast tomorrow night at his home And Brother Yuanlong will be there Inviting me to the Minister's house? Hear this well! If the Du clan isn't killed off, I won't be wrongly accused, and Tao Yuan village can avoid a disaster There is a cause for everything History will change tomorrow night Brother, General Hojo has arrived Long time no see, General Yuanlong! Ever since Tokugawa eliminated the Hideyoshi, the era of warring states was essentially over My clan was once grand, but we've had to lay low, waiting for an opportunity since the Edo bakufu has General Hojo, it's no wonder your nation's power keeps growing I sailed here this time in hope of receiving support from the Ming court, especially that of your strength, General. If you could extend a helping hand, then the Hojo clan has hope for a revival Don't you worry. So long as you're my ally, I will help you banish the Tokugawa and help you rebuild If so, then I thank you Brother He! Sao! Hey, how does my hair look? Looks good! Like yours! Looks damn good! Did something on your mind bring you up here? Sao help me protect the village, okay? Protect it? Why? To guard against bandits sure! When? Tonight I'm counting on you This is who I was telling you about - General Hojo This is Eunuch Wei. In the Ming court, all are below him, except for one Having access to the great general's forces is a great honor for this humble servant "So many stars, are thoughts that stir my sleep" "Like the moon, shining into night" "The past drifts away, yet returns, so vague" "Like my visions of you" "Just a goodbye, yet so hard to say" "My heart left stranded" "A forever farewell, adistance so vast" "Just one, last look at you" "If time could slow down," "Then I could think of you again." "Before that last day arrives," "Let me rewrite its end." "Just one more moment," "And we can have forever." It is an honor, Excellency General He, forgive my not coming to meet you Please Our plan of grand conquest begins tonight! Luckily! Catch 2 for dinner You are on a mission for the Hojo clan Will you give it all you've got? Fear not, General! Thanks to the Emperor's good graces, I am home to see family Your sworn brother Yuanlong and my daughter have come, too Professionally and personally, inviting master He Ying to attend is a must Brother He Ying! Little brother. Long time no see Indeed. I have yet to wish the newlyweds well Congratulations, madame Most gracious, General He The new song you just learned - could you play it for my little brother to liven up tonight's celebration? I will do my best What, don't you like my hairstyle? I'm the one who gave it to you When you reach Tao Yuan village, kill everything and spare nothing! Kill! Kill! Kill! Move out! Niehu? Together with the Jap raiders? Minister... General He, Eunuch Wei has ordered that you hand the key activating the orb over to General Yuanlong to take to the capitol for presentation to the Emperor I can't I cannot give it to him Minister should it be wrongly used, it would cause total chaos and harm everyone What's more, the Emperor is young Please think this matter over Minister Du, did you know This son-in-law of yours, has long known this secret He Ying, disobeying imperial edicts is a crime punishable by clan execution You shut up Minister I came tonight hoping that we might go to the palace and see the Emperor Do you realize that the Ming dynasty will be destroyed in ten years? If the Emperor stays in the dark, he will die of illness in two more years! Insolence! More ridiculous with every word! Since when do you decide when the Ming will perish! And you dare curse the Emperor's life! Soldiers! Sir! Niehu! You'd dare collude with the Japanese! Don't be so hasty, Sao. Let me explain You know I hate Jap raiders more than anything! You could befriend the enemy and take them as your own? Your brothers are already allied with me Kill him, Niehu I know you're up to no good! Where did that group of raiders go? They went to level Tao Yuan village Jap bastard... I'm going to kill you! Execute him! Sir! - Dad! - Don't go over there! Dad! Very brazen of you, He Ying - killing Minister Du, and then even my wife? We will attest to it You're the murderer! So this was all your doing, all along, dishonoring me, setting me up! You couldn't even leave your family out of it! It's just a few lives But let me tell you a beautiful life, wealth and rank, it's all bullshit! For me these two were nothing but an interlude They had to die. You have two choices One, your clan dies Two, give me the Linga and we work together And I say, I choose option three - me walking out and definitely not giving you the Linga! He Ying! Cooperating with me is your best choice! There is no better way! Stop! We grew up together! When I make it big, so will you! Bring it on! Stop it! I'm going to kill you tonight! I'm not going to hold back! So you come back from the future and learned nothing? I learned only one thing from the future And that's... He Ying if you don't work with me, you won't be able to change history I found the Linga The big things we're working on why won't you help me? Why! Instead, you push me? Why must you push me! You push and push! Niehu settle this Did you guys have fun today? Yeah, but I'm a little tired You think the drill instructor will be mad because we slipped out? Who cares about him I'm hungry Why don't we catch a rabbit later? Yeah, good idea Niehu in the next life, I'm not going to catch rabbits with you Ever thought you might sit up there one day? I never thought that when Chinese kill each other, they'd more ruthless than us Japanese Ma! Jade! Ma! He Ying you're back As long as you're back safe He Ying... A man of character must do four things Only then can my conscience be clear We must first protect our land, our households, our brothers, and our women and children May! May, I'm back! May! Boss You're back Hojo's men wiped out the village The Linga you wanted...we found it He Ying you didn't think I'd do it, eh? What? I killed Sao He saw me with Hojo I had to kill him Good You're in the big leagues now I'll get back the Linga, then return and save you again May if the orb was right before us, and could take us take us once more to the future, Where would you most want to go? I don't know You? What I most want to know is - where I came from... and where I must go You're so philosophical Come out, Yuanlong. I'm here You're worthy of your title, General He The Forbidden City No one is permitted in If you hadn't arranged it how could I have entered so easily? Time to jump in I want you to start the orb with me Eunuch Wei the Tao Yuan people have always been submissive subjects of the empire We were content, knew our place and lived in peace! Why did you kill them all? Why? You deceived the Emperor You deserved extermination! And I carried it out And your brother, Sao - also died by my sword All that I promised General Yuanlong, I delivered He Ying! Stop wasting time! Work nicely with us and start the orb! You... so long as I'm here, I won't let your plan succeed! Fine, Yuanlong I promise to start the orb! But on one condition send May back to the future, or you won't get the incantation! He Ying, I don't want to leave! Just go, May! This is not your world! He Ying, I want to be with you! Such drivel May! You want to save her then start the chant! He Ying, do you still remember? What I want to know most is where I came from, where I must go, and where I truly belong This is where you belong Stay here But I can't stay with you start the orb! Dammit! I'll come back to save you, May The chant! The chant! Do it! God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva...

You haven't fulfilled the bargain You're not going anywhere! Yuanlong! I told you I won't let your plan succeed! You can't escape Then you're going down with me! Whose is this? What the... Who asked for water? Why is this happening? You're not getting out of this Come back, He Ying! He Ying! God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... God mandates Bodhisattva Mahasattva The Emperor mandates Bodhisattva... Why are we still in the Ming? Why are we still here? Impossible! Boss! Shut it! Yuanlong this catastrophe is your doing Arrest him! Soldiers! Arrest him! Sir! We are allies! You allied with Japanese raiders with malicious intent You defiled the palace. I hereby strip you of your title! Let it go, boss! Now the elite guard has me to lead them! since we were kids, you called the shots Unless you die, how can I advance! Go back to the future with me The future? The future is dangerous! The Emperor approaches! Careful, Your Majesty What happened here? I bow before the Emperor Eunuch Wu, protect the Emperor What are you doing, General Yuan? Such audacity! Will you not kneel before the Emperor? You kneel! This is the future! No one kneels! Insolence! Look out, Your Majesty! Where am I? What is this place? He Ying! You've returned once more, General He Life becomes Death Death becomes Life In three cycles This is your last chance I'd already mastered the orb's secret Why then can't I change history...change fate? Such is life When you chose to go right, what awaited you at the end was naturally a predetermined conclusion And should I choose to go left? Would the outcome be different? I cannot answer you as the choice is yours to make You can only find out by walking the paths yourself If life's outcomes could be foreseen, then what is the joy in life? Perhaps... activating the orb was a mistake Possessing the ability to travel through time may not bring the happiness and results one wants, after all Much less could it bring peace Power corrupts It stokes greed and ambition Its consequences can't be controlled Man cannot even control his own fate How can he alter history? And so the space-time orb must be destroyed Traveling between past and future is a dream that should not be realized Yet I have become the universe's sole time traveler
