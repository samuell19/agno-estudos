Ciuksza Band threatened again Readers and listeners put up a fight for Ciuksza Band As we all know they want to disband the Ciuksza mandolin orchestra. This is our orchestra, the orchestra of the Lodz workers. lt broadcasts soothing melodies on the Lodz Radio. lt has also given numerous concerts at our factory. We have filed a protest against the closure of our band, our workers' band from Lodz. They should kick out the Warsaw New Band first. They sound like cats on heat. Those fancy pants with the stupid hats should get the boot. l could listen to Ciuksza night and day. We demand that Ciuksza stays! After all our town needs some decent music, not only... We want a soothing orchestra. All that big-beat music is just for them youths. Whereas this band we all listen to. Why aren't they putting Ciuksza on today. Some bleeding trombones and what not. All that horseplay when that was lovely and cheered you up. They hardly ever it put on but when they do at least we get a few minutes of fun and leisure. l admit that when Ciuksza's on l do nothing around the house, nothing what so ever. l stay in and don't budge. l must listen to the programme. And when you're down Ciuksza cheers you up. lt gives you a bit of vim. lf they take even that away from us they might as well take away our lives. They lock you up in your old age and try to take even those few hours away. We object to that. But first of all, Poland is a workers' country, and they should let the band stay for the workers' sake. We demand that. Them lot in Warsaw and Katowice always get the best of everything. What is Lodz to this country? Ciuksza has played for, what's it, forty years. lt has been nice, and now, out of the blue, they made this stupid decision, whoever that was, to shut down Ciuksza. We demand Ciuksza Band, we want Ciuksza Band, we want Ciuksza Band, we want Ciuksza Band. Long live Ciuksza Band! Mrs. Gorecka is leaving us today and we've prepared a small leaving celebration for her. With this flower, we'd like to bid her goodbye. For many years Mrs. Gorecka worked in the sorting house, then she worked in the bookkeeping department, a very diligent worker. So, on behalf of the Plant Committee, our management and myself, l'd like to wish you all the best for the future, long life and good health. And l'd like to thank all my colleagues. l have worked here over 20 years and l don't know if l could work another... l'd like to but l can't. On behalf of the youngest weavers l'd like to wish you good health and happiness. l also wish you all the best for the future. Don't you forget to come and visit us. You've been coming to work for half seven or half five. What are you going to do with yourself now? Read, go for walks... l'll finally have a chance to rest. You'll have time just for yourself. You'll have to get a decent shag now and again not to get too bored. Give the old man a good rub, brew him some herbal tea, he'll be fit as a fiddle. ''For she's a jolly good fellow...'' l'd like to give my thanks to the Women's League and our Management for taking good care of us. We are very grateful that our company continues to take good care of us. That's all from me. l come from Warsaw. ln 1945... or four l went through some really hard times. When l came to the plant, as a complete stranger, people made me feel welcome. Myself and my husband got our livelihood here. l've been working here for 18 years now. l've been working in the weaving-mill. They know me well there because l used to help out with the workers' fund. When someone needed a few bob in lean times, or had a problem, they came to Mrs.Wlostkowska. And that's what l'm thankful to the plant for, that they always remember about me when there's a day trip or anything. l have a lot of respect. l think of Lodz as my second hometown. What could l tell you that no one else would, What could l give you that no other might, For you, my dearest, l'd do the best l could. l want to brighten your cloudy night. l want to pave it with stars just for you, For you to tread on as on thistle-down. What could l give you that no one else would, Tell me, love... Do you know that military one... ''Parachutes, parachutes'' Parachutes... - We have no score to that. - Anna Kazimierczak What? Are you here to sing? No? So, please, go away. Are you going to sing? No? Off you go then. Who's next? A soldier won't lie to his girl... tam, ta...ta, tam, tam... Scram, if you don't want a wallop. Here you are. When you feel you've had enough say 'stop'. But don't let go. l'll switch it off immediately. Stop. - 120 Volts. - How much did l have? First time round it really gave me a jolt. Monkey, hold it as hard as you can. Don't be a chicken. - 160 Volts. - You see, you stuck it out. When you've had enough say 'stop' and don't let go. 220. Little. 220 is as as far as it will go. A soldier won't lie on his girl l mean, to his girl. C minor. A soldier won't lie to his girl, Though he won't speak of his fight, A soldier will go where bullets hurl, Back home he'll tell of his plight. Down a beaten road... ... and a forest track He seeks the red flower the colour of blood. He goes for his hour has struck. ''l swear l won't'' Go ahead. No, no, no, l won't be that daft l won't fall in love l won't be that way. Nay! No, no, no, l won't be lovelorn my heart won't be torn Mum's the word. l won't. Like water off a duck's back. He stuck out the whole 220 and wanted more. Go ahead, take your chances. Won't it kill me? Has it killed anyone yet? But what if it kills me? - Go on, have a go. - Here you are, give it a try. - l'm scared. - Scared of what? lt's harmless. As you can see, the weather is being kind to the Polish song. You will have the pleasure of listening to the rythm section led by Zdzislaw Pucek. You will be instructed by a soloist from the Warsaw operetta, Janusz Szudunski. Enjoy. There's a town under the skies, Though you'd search the maps in vain, Where the azure sky never cries A gloomy Autumn rain, Where no love is left unrequited, Where folk dream only good dreams, Where the silver moon is delighted To stay bright for you and me. And now, everybody, you might try on your own. Try once again, from the beginning. There's a town... One day in the course of time Perhaps in our live's fall We'll live in this good gentle town. There must be one after all. Perhaps at the end of the world There's a town, the best of all towns. Perhaps it shines like gold, Or perhaps it shines in us.
