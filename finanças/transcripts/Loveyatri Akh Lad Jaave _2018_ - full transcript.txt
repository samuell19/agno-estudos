How are you, Hari? How are you, Dinu? - Great? - Great. - And, what about your family? - They are all great. Nice. Nice. So...what's up? It's about your son Susu's tuition fee. You haven't paid him yet? I told him clearly. So what if he's our neighbor. But since he's tutoring our son, we must pay the tuition fee. Settle down. Settle down. I already paid his fee. Yes, he's paid the fee. Then why are you asking For fee again? Mrs. Seema, I've come to return the tuition fee. I've been teaching at that college for 13 years. But, I've never seen anyone as ambitionless as Susu. I've heard that when Einstein was his age,.. ...he didn't have any ambitions either. Hari, Einstein gave the world the Theory of Relativity. But your son teaches children how to play "Garba" See...it's all because of your WhatsApp jokes. What've my WhatsApp jokes got to do with this? - Your brother spoilt him. - No, he didn't. Don't drag my brother in all this. You better explain to Susu. I will talk to him. Call him. Where is he? He's still in College. He's got the entire college dancing to his tunes in the name of "Nite before Navratri" "Says Lord Krishna to Mother Yashodha." "Why is Radha so fair and me so dark." "Leave me alone..." "Don't cast a spell on me with your eyes. Your words..." "Steal my heart." "Come closer, don't skirt eyes." "Make me yours, beloved." "Steal my heart." "There's no one like you wherever I look." "You and me look wonderful together." "Colours flying..." "Colours flying..." "When you winked at me." "Colours flying..." "When you winked at me." "Yo Yo Honey Singh." "Sway with me...and put your hands up in the air." "Sway with me." "Sway with me." "And call the Garba party over." "Sway with me." "So what if your beloved's dark." "But he has a big heart." "Hurry up... and don't delay anymore." "I've asked for you on the night of Loveratri." "Hold your veil dear, as it flutters in the air." "As I move closer, you step back." "Hold your veil dear, as it flutters in the air." "As I move closer, you step back." "There's no one like you wherever I look." "You and me look wonderful together." "Colours flying..." "Amazing." "Colours flying..." "When you winked at me." "Colours flying..." "When you winked at me." "Says Lord Krishna to Mother Yashodha." "Why is Radha so fair and me so dark." "Colours flying..." "When you winked at me." "Colours flying..." "When you winked at me." Break the harmonium and the drum That was fun. That was fun. Why can't you drive properly? I got you here safe and sound. Goodnight. - Later Bro - Look Negative, its uncle. Let's quietly get out of here. - Come on. - Take care. Why did Rocket and Negative run away when they saw me? Don't know, dad. Maybe they were getting late. Late? Late for what? It's only 12.30 am. Call them back. Go for another ride. Don't worry about home. You can come home at any time. Stop taunting me, dad. I got late because there was a Garba program at the college. Garba program. Son, have you thought about anything other than Garba? Actually, I have. First I'll get changed and then hit the bed. Goodnight dad!! I am not talking about that. I am talking about your future. What have you thought about your future? Well, my future... What do you want to do, What do you want to pursue. Dad, you know my dream is to start my own Garba Academy. Garba Academy. Son, Garba can be many things... ...but, it cannot be the goal of your life. Papa. Look, son. I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you. But Garba is played only for 9 days. You'll have to do something for the rest of the 356 days. Look, dad, I have a theory. Garba is the mother of all dance forms. Everything has evolved from Garba. For example, if you hold a Girl's hand and do Garba, then... Then that's Salsa. If you keep breaking between Garba... ...then that's Breakdance. Yeah! If you clap while dancing, then that's... D I S C O Disco! Disco! Disco! And, when beautiful girls Go up on their toes,... ...& raise their chins high... ...draped in suede white clothes, dance slowly- and softly... With mesmerizing music... ...and girls as beautiful as angels... ...twisting and turning. ...then that's called Ballet. Good morning boys and girls, the day has come when you are to graduate. Here you go. Well done. As usual, Michelle. Best student. Well done. Well done. - Yes. - Well done. Dad! Michelle. Michelle, my love. I was just messaging you. - I got my results, and... - I know, I know. A Grade, 1st Class. That's why I got you this. Do you like it? - I love it, dad. - I knew you would. But, how did you know? - How did I know what? - My results. Don't be silly, Michelle. You're the most ambitious girl I know. You had to top. You're awesome, dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. You got me this gift, but I want another gift. Of course, anything you want. The trip to India, Dad. Michelle, India... - You promised dad. - Yeah, I know I promised. But ...you have a lot of preparations to do for B-School. I don't think you will have the time. Next year, okay. - Do you want to go for lunch? - Yes. - Do you want to drive? - Yes. Who is it now? - Hello. - Sameer, Sameer - Please come down here. - There's been a big problem. Wait...what's going on. Uncle Natu, Uncle Natu What... What happened to my brother? - Seems like a heart attack. - Heart attack. - It's a heart attack. - Yes. - Just a minute. - Can only one of you talk, please. Sameer, please come to India immediately. No-no-no, hold on a minute, guys. I can't come like that. Please take the next flight and come down here as soon as you can. And we're taking him to the hospital. What...what is wrong with my brother? Yes...let's talk later. We've to take him to the hospital. - No no no. I can't leave just now. Listen to me. Try to understand. "The goglet is jingling." "The manjira is tingling." "The bracelets of the girl are jingling" "It's chiming along with her anklets" Hey Harry Potter. Come on. "Along with her friends.." "Move..." "He will play his melodies with his flute" Susu! Let's go. We've to go visit your uncle. "The colour of love will fall on everyone." Sahil.

"Pardon " "the insolence..." of my eyes." How is it looking? Ma'am... Don't buy this. But why? If you wear this dress to the Garba... ...then I am sure at least a dozen guys will drop dead. They will have to call the ambulance. Garba will have to be stopped. You will cause a lot of problems. So let it be. Oh, come on. You're just praising me for sales. I swear on Lord. Fine, pack these. That's more like it. So, this is the third dress. Choose six more. What? Do you want someone to notice that you repeated the same dress twice? No-No-No. Exactly. I don't want that either. Choose a few more dresses quickly. Laliya, show her the good ones kept at the back. Come on. Amazing, uncle. just amazing. You can sell anyone to anything. I am a specialist. Lady's specialist. I can sense what women want Rocket It's nothing like that, he's just flattering you. The point is what about the Navratri passes. Negative... Thank you. That's the problem with you. You're going to remain negative all your life. - Why? - Am I not the best Garba singer in the city? - Yes. - Then as long as I'm the lead singer you guys don't have to worry about the passes What do you think of me? Here you go. That's too many uncle. We only need two. We two, happy pair. Leave him out. Rascals, he's my uncle and I don't get a pass? You attending the - Garba is a waste of time. - Exactly. Girls from all around the world attend it. But he never likes anyone. I fall in love a dozen times during Navratri. - And even a dozen heartbreaks. - Look, bro. I am only interested in Garba. Uncle, you should get him checked up. There is some technical fault in him. There is no technical fault. You are always bothering him. Just watch. This Navratri, he'll get lucky too. What do you mean? And, how will I know if I do? What nonsense, uncle. What? Son... When you'll meet her for the first time... ...your eyes will communicate.

Missed you so much. I missed you too, my angel. Son. My brother is back. It's a good thing you are here. You look absolutely fine. You wanted to see me in the hospital? No. - Then... You said over the phone that you had a heart attack. Who did? - You said on the phone. - Me. Yes, you said you had a heart attack. Oh yes... That. That was a gastro attack. I took some digestives and gone with the wind. I get it. I get it. I get it. I left my laundry business behind, she was preparing for her MBA school... ...and you guys are playing a prank on us, right? I was going to call you and say this is a false alarm... ...but, you had already boarded. Okay. But, there's no emergency now. You know what, Daku, go book our return tickets. Yes. - Now that you're here, stay for a few days. - Why? - Navratri starts tomorrow. - So. - You can leave after Navratri. If you stay for a week here, will the queen's Gown get dirty?

But only she... ...will look colorful and bright. Your heart will skip a beat. You'll lose all ties from reality. It will be like magic. Susu, what happened? How did you fall down? - It came true. - What? Uncle's poetry, it came true. Everything was in slow-motion. I could only see her in color, and everyone else looked black and white. I grew wings. - In the middle of the ground? - Yes. He's lying. Oh man... - I am not lying. - I was flying... in the air. At least 12-13 feet in the air. Were you flying with a measuring tape? He's in love. He's found his love. Who is the girl? Did you talk to her? Did you take a picture? What group was she in? What is her name? Stop celebrating prematurely Why are you being so negative? - Let's look for her. - Negative. You go right, I'll go left. Susu, you go straight. - Okay. Come on. - Hold on. Only he's seen the girl. - He's got a point. - Fine. Then let's look for her together. That will be more fun. Are you guys high? How will we find one girl in this massive crowd? Negative, where there is a will, there is a way!! Come on. In our case, we've brighter chances of finding God, but not the girl. - I found her. - Where? We found her. We found her. Enough celebrations now, Lets get some more information on her. How do we do that? We don't know anyone in her group. Let's take a look first. Khusboo. 'Friendship...or Loveship.' Don't even think about it. She will slap me immediately. But you're used to that, take one for the team. Yes, but... People take a bullet for friends, and you can't take a slap. Friendship demands trials. - It also demands lives. - Shut up. Stop worrying about your life. Go on, Rocket. Can't you do this much for me? He'll get slapped again. Khus... Khus... Khusboo. - You? - Sorry. It's me, but... I'll hit you with my dandia stick today. I'm not here to propose today. - Then? - I just want some information. What information? Who is that? Nattu uncle? - No, Ewww... - Then? The one next to Nattu uncle. You mean her. Have you seen yourself in the mirror? Not for me, stupid. - I am happy to settle for you. - What? Sorry. For a friend. - Which friend? - Susu. Has Susu lost his mind? Tell him that this girl is out of his league Just tell me, please. Fine. She is Michelle. Michelle. As in Obama's wife? -Is she Christian? -Maybe. Father's name is Sam, the daughter's name is Michelle. So you'll have to covert your religion. Stupid. Don't talk nonsense. People normally change their name in the UK. - He's right. - Wait. How do you know? That's what they do in foreign countries. Trilok becomes Tom, Jignesh becomes John. Don't try to teach me. The other bad news is that the girl is a scholar. She's topped the London University. And they are very rich. They are only visiting for Navratri... ...and leave on Dussera. Got it. You need to forget about this love story - There is no scope for it. - Why? Why not? You're saying this because you haven't seen the girl. She's the one whom the other 74,999 people are staring in a crowd of 75,000. She is so beautiful that if she uploads her picture on Facebook... ...then Zuckerberg's servers will crash. Plus she's an NRI, uncle. Guys here loose their senses when they hear the word 'NRI'. She's a rich NRI, means they earn in Pounds. And we three share a cup of tea. She has topped the London college... ..and he barely goes through with grace Chagganbhai Gokuldas Art's College. Are they even a match? Are they? No... You really are no match for her. Then? But don't worry Susu. We'll find someone from Fatheganj for you. No need to find anyone. - Don't be disheartened. - No, you should be. Let him be disheartened, uncle. There is no scope for him in this case. Be quiet, please be quiet. Susu, come here. Don't pay attention to what he says. This is about love. And love never cares about rich or poor. Love is like a sim card. And sim card fits in every mobile phone, big or small. And you guys... ...you're forgetting one important thing. She is leaving but after 8 days. Susu, no one can take these 8 days and 8 nights from you. Remember what I said to you? This Navratri you will find your love too. Son, in these 8 days... ...come doomsday, or earthquake,... ...you will win her heart. Uncle, what's the plan? Okay, this is the Garba ground. This is a veil. I know its a veil. But can we assume this is a Garba ground? Yes, okay. - Is that okay? - Yes. - Can we move ahead? - Please. This is the Garba ground. What happened? What happened? - She injured his eye. - What the... - His eye is injured. - Poor guy has gone blind. - Let's go. - Come on, get up. - Who is going to marry him now? Will you marry a blind man? Your eye is injured. Your eye, not your leg. - What happened? - That guy... - Come on. - Here comes the apology call What's the matter, uncle? Why isn't it ringing? - It's ringing. It's ringing. - Is it ringing? - Hang up. Hang up. - I was just checking. Sorry. Sorry. I hung up. Uncle, when is it going to ring? It will ring. Look she must have sat down to have breakfast. Now she will shift to the side to call you. Excuse me. Now she will dial your number. What's wrong, uncle? Why isn't it ringing? She will disconnect. - I knew it. - Hey... She is hesitating. Now she will dial your number again. It's ringing. It's ringing. - All the best. - Thank you. Hello. Hi, Susu. Who is this? This is Michelle. Last night I accidentally injured you. Okay. I mean, it's okay. I just wanted to say sorry. I mean you wouldn't intentionally hit someone in the eye with a Dandia. How is the injury now? I hope it's not too serious. Well, the doctor's put a bandage on the eye now. - I can see with only one eye. - Ohh... But when he changes my dressing in the evening,.. I'll know how serious it is. Okay. Take care. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Uncle, what's happening? Now for the most important point. Tonight... Why tonight uncle, I'm heading over to the Garba ground right now. No. Tonight you will not attend the Garba. - Uncle, what are you saying? - You won't go, you won't go. Uncle said you won't go, so cannot go. Coming. Hello. Yeah, hello. No one's here. You guys have given me this duty instead of Garba. I told you she won't come. Hold on. Wait. Yes, she's here. I saw her. I saw her. Don't know, she's looking for something. She is looking for you. Maybe Are you listening? Two exercises in a single second. "The number you're trying to call is currently not reachable." - Hello. - Hello, who is this? Who are you? I am Michelle, Susu's friend. - Is Susu at home? - Yes, he is. I think he's sleeping. Okay. How is his eye? His eye? Its brown, why? No, I mean is his eye all right? Well, when he was small, I thought he's a little cockeyed. But, he looks all right now. Why? No, I mean can he see everything clearly. What can I say, dear? He can see everything clearly except for his future. No, I mean he got hurt on his eye. - Hurt? - Just a minute. You injured your eye? But when? Hi. Sorry, I was taking a bath. What did the ophthalmologist say? Who? What did the eye-doctor say? Oh, the eye-doctor? He said its nothing major. He's just put a patch on my eye. Oh, okay good. So are you coming today? Yes. But I am not supposed to play Garba. - Says who? - My uncle. - What? - Doctor uncle. My uncle. He's an eye doctor. He said I shouldn't play Garba. - Okay. - But I will come over to see you. Okay, great. - See you then, bye. - Bye. Bye. How are you now? Good. Does it hurt? A little. - I am really sorry. - It's okay. You didn't hit me intentionally. But still... I felt bad. I didn't become blind. Your Hindi is pretty good. I am not a foreigner. I know Gujarati as well. We moved to London only a few years ago. I see. By the way, were you always so fair... ...or, did it happen after you moved to London? By the way, what's the story behind your name Susu? Sushrut. Susurut! Shu-shrut. That's what I said. Susurut! Don't confuse yourself. Even Susu sounds pretty good from your mouth. Yes, but isn't this a weird name. It's very weird. It was the name of a great sage And that name took all my happiness from me. It's so obvious that people will cut down Sushrut to Susu. But no. Papa named me after him. It's okay. At least it's still your name. And I can't use my original name. After we moved to London, Papa changed my name to Michelle. And he said this Indian name won't do in London. You know, everyone's busy with themselves. I sometimes feel like an alien there. Alien? You mean like Jadoo? Jadoo? Jadoo? Koi Mil Gaya. Don't you watch Indian Films? Yes, exactly like Jadoo. It's a good thing you're here then. This magical night of Navratri... ...doesn't let anyone feel like an alien. "O, Drummer." "O, Drummer." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." "O, Drummer." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." "On this magical night, you make my heart sway..." "...tinkering your bangles at midnight?" "On this magical night, you make my heart sway..." "...tinkering your bangles at midnight?" "This magical night, beloved..." "...makes my heart beat faster." "Just say that you're with me tonight." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O, Drummer." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." "O, Drummer." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." "The clouds have covered the sky." "As my heart flutters with you, sweetheart." "The clouds have covered the sky." "As my heart flutters with you, sweetheart." "With your eyes..." "...you pull me towards you." "With your eyes you pull me towards you." "Don't make me pine." "This magical night, beloved..." "...makes my heart beat faster." "Just say that you're with me tonight." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O Drummer...beat the drums." "O, Drummer." "O, Drummer." "O, Drummer." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." Aren't you going to wear a helmet? Helmets are illegal in Baroda. Just kidding I am just joking. This is my friend, Negative. Na... Nagendra. - That's Rakesh. - Rocket Nice meeting you guys. - Me too. Nice meeting you too. - Here you go. - No! Please serve her in a special cup. - Okay. - No-no, its fine. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. So people in Rome also drink tea in such small glasses? I don't know. I have never travelled beyond Rajkot. Me neither. No. I meant...even I'll have cutting-tea like you guys. I see... In case you guys don't know, even I am a Barodian, like you guys. I know, I was the one who told them. What? That...we should invite you here for a cup of tea. - Okay. - Ohh... that was his idea. By the way, drinking cutting-tea doesn't make you a Barodian. Oh really. Then how do you become one? By travelling through the flavors of Baroda. The journey of flavors? Dude, please explain. Mahakali's Sev-Ussal. Papdi-no-lott. Pyarelal's Kachori. - Manmohan's Samosa. - Raju's Omlete. - Vishal's Sandwich. - Lalji bhai's fritters. - Panipuri. - Rajasthani Kulfi. Sasu Vahu no Handvo. Marutinandan Soda. - And then... - Penda. From Dhuliram's. Not your cup of tea, forget it. Shall we? During Navratri, you can get food here all night. - And the food... - Pav-bhaji. - The food... - With extra butter. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. This Pav-bhaji with double butter is really amazing. People come to eat this from far and wide. Bouncer Pav-bhaji. World famous in Gujarat. What happened? - Manisha? - Wait. Where are you going? You will drop the Bhaji. It's got extra butter. Sorry, couldn't stop myself. Of course not. That's the best thing to do. You know, back in London I volunteer every Sunday. So there's this place called the Goodman Shelter. And they provide food, clothes, for the needy and poor. So. Wow! Where is Manisha? I don't know. I have looked everywhere for her. You two were playing Garba together, weren't you? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Your family. It's getting late. Where were you, Manisha? You know, Nattu uncle and the children have already left. I was here. - What are you doing? - Meaning? She is a very nice girl. Don't play with her feelings. What do you mean? I am not a bad guy either. This charade of getting injured... - ...shall I tell her about it. - What are you saying? You know what, it's all my fault. I should have never given her your number. But anyway, I will tell her everything now. Listen, Khusboo. Just listen. Susu, what are you doing here? Yeah. You didn't come for Garba, didn't answer my calls , or reply to messages... ...hence I came here. Actually, I was... - Sorry. Actually, I was going to tell you everything... ...but that tattletale Khusboo told you everything. - Tell me what? - The truth. Look, I know I shouldn't have pretended about getting injured. I should have rejected that idea in the first place. But I had no choice. You are so beautiful, intelligent, plus you're an NRI. You would've never given a second look to a guy like me. That's why I took the sympathy route. But is it my fault that I started liking you. I had no option. I am not giving you any clarification, because I am clarifying myself. What am I saying? I am sorry. You didn't give me a chance to explain myself, and switched off your phone. That's why I had to come down here and do all this. Now, you can slap me if you want. Why are you laughing? You're so sweet. Khusboo didn't tell me anything. And, I already knew about your fake injury. How? You got hit here, and you put a bandage here. And only for one day. Later you forgot all about it. Rocket and Negative are useless. And so is uncle. Doctor Uncle. ? Why didn't you come for Garba night? I've had an upset stomach since morning Who feeds these things to an NRI girl? Duffer. So you knew everything, then why didn't you say something earlier? I liked it. I found you and your fake bandage really cute. "I can feel being drawn closer to you." "Becoming aloof from myself." "There has to be a reason..." "...that we met." "Gradually I became yours." "Slowly I became yours." "Eventually I became yours." "Without you...I've no existence." "Gradually I became yours." "Slowly I became yours." "Eventually I became yours." "Without you...I've no existence." "Try to understand... Understand my gesture." "I am completely...yours." "The way I'm in love with you..." "...it will never happen again." "The place you hold in my heart..." "...there's a reason you dwell in there." "There has to be a reason..." "...that we met." "Gradually I became yours." "Slowly I became yours." "Eventually I became yours." "Without you...I've no existence." Take a left from here. Where are we? Manisha, where are you going? Listen. This is my mom's place. All my memories of her begin here... ...and end here. Mom used to run a NGO here... ...where underprivileged women would get work, and respect. She had various plans for this NGO. Manisha. - Mom. - Mom. Then what happened? Papa was very supportive of mom's plans. When I was only 4-years-old... ...they decided that if papa goes to London for sometime... ...then things will get much easier for us financially. And mom can achieve her dreams much sooner. After papa went to London, he had to face many complications. Like setting up a new business, or the immigration. He kept asking for more time, more time... ...and couldn't come back for many years. Not even when mom was seriously ill. And then one-day mom was no more. I was only 10. For the next two years, Uncle Nattu was like a mother & father to me. I have no complaints from dad. He loves me a lot. He means the world to me now. Sorry. I don't know why I am telling you all this. I don't know either. But you should tell someone. Takes the burden off your chest. You just wait and watch Susu. I will come back after finishing my studies. And fulfill mom's dream. finally after many years we'll celebrate Navratri happily. Remember the Navratri in the olden days. And look at it now. It's a complete makeover. They are over there Hey Himanshu!! - Samir. - Welcome. - Come on, come and join us. - Yes, come on ?. - No, you guys play... - Come on. Come on. Madhvi, where is Michelle? Michelle went home. Didn't you meet her? - But she didn't come home? - Didn't she? Wait. Her friend Khuboo must know. Khusboo. Khusboo. Samir uncle. - How are you? - Bless you, dear. Where is Michelle? Michelle. She... - Madhvi you go. - Yeah... - Hello. - Hello. Sushrut. Yes, Sushrut speaking. This is Sam. Sam Patel. Michelle's father. Yes. Hello, sir. Susu. Sushrut. But aren't you know as Susu? Come. We've come quite far up, haven't we? Baroda City. Every person in this city wants to settle abroad. Isn't it? And the easiest way to do that... ...is to find an NRI girl and marry her. I am sorry sir, but I have no such dreams. Is it? What do you do? Sir, I teach Garba to small children. And, what about your future? I want to start my own Garba Academy. Start my own Garba Academy. - Garba Academy. - Yes. Wow... You see, Michelle will join the London Business Academy. I know. It's the best Business school in London. - Yes. - Later, when she starts her internship... ...her starting package will be 85,000 Pounds. And in a couple of years, it will be double. Very nice. The cultures are very different. Michelle is from western culture. And so is her understanding. No, sir, she's very much Indian. - Her dream is to... - And you understood this in two days? Huh? Look. The reason I am talking to you is so that you don't get hurt. Because you have no future with her Because Michelle is here. On the top. And you're there, down. The gap is too big. Did she tell you about Chris? - Chris? - Yes, her boyfriend. They study together. Didn't she tell you? Strange. Let it be. Dude, take it down. And gently. Papa. Yes, dear. I am here. - Papa, guess what? - What? I got into business school. Really? Congratulations. Congratulations. Well done, dear. But I knew it, you know. I was so confident of you. - Do you have my credit card? - Yes, papa. Then go celebrate. Throw a grand party for your friends Go. Go. Go. Your pizza ma'am. - Thank you. - Welcome ma'am. Guys, I still can't believe this. This is the best day of my life. Ours too. We never imagined we'll get to dine in an expensive restaurant like this. We're happy with extra gravy in ussal. A special occasion calls for a special party. It does. Cheers. And do you guys know,... London Business Academy is the UK's - no. 1 business school. - Yes. It was my dream to get admission there. I worked very hard for it. It's a really big deal for me. You know, last year their average pay package was 85,000 Pounds. Mind-blowing. What mind-blowing? Do you know how much is 85,000 Pounds? I don't, but the way she is saying, it must be a lot of money. I see. Almost 7.5 million rupees. What the bloody... And that's just the beginning. It will double up in a couple of years. I've already planned everything. After that, I will go into investment banking. And after that, I've no words to express it. The sky is the limit. Susu, stop it. How much ketchup are you going to pour on it? Why? What's wrong with ketchup? Huh! Anything wrong with ketchup? That's the way we are. We eat more ketchup than the pizza. - What's wrong with you? - Calm down. No...I've had enough of her. What do you mean you've had enough? I've had enough of your pompous behavior. You've been going on and on boasting about business school, investment banking,... 7.5 million package. Whether your package is 7.5 million or 70.5 million. I don't care a damn. I teach Garba to the children because I like it. And what do you want to prove by telling us all this? That you're superior to us. - What are you saying, Susu? - Shut up! Don't interfere. I am not trying to prove anything. I am sharing all this with you because I thought you're my special friend. Special friend. Please don't try to convince me with this 'friend'. You can tell me these things... ...but, you never told me what you should have. And what didn't I tell you? You are so shameless. I am not finished yet. You didn't think it was important to tell me because you didn't think I wasn't important. Because I put ketchup on my pizza. You want ketchup. - Here's your ketchup. - Stop showing you're anger,... ...and also your love for India. The truth is you have a rotten mentality... ...who thinks we're superior because we're settled abroad. - And the others... - Stop it! You stop it! Okay. End of the day, you want to be a money-minting machine like your father. The truth is you're not interested in fulfilling your mother's dreams. That was all a lie. What were you two doing when he was arguing with Manisha? - Why didn't you do something? - What could we do? Look, uncle, the truth is always bitter. Whoever had realized the gap first, this would've happened. Shut up! Please! Susu! Susu! Listen to me. Maybe she's not the kind of girl you think she is. I think you hurt her. Uncle, what now? Call her. Talk to her. Say you're sorry. she's blocked my number. In fact, she's blocked me on FB as well. What FB. Forget Facebook. Tell her face-to-face. Susu. Go. Excuse me I want to meet Michelle. They left for Ahmedabad. They have a flight to London. She is going to London. - Let's go to Ahmedabad. - Why? We'll make it to the airport before her flight leaves. - Are you joking? - Haven't you seen in films? The climax of every love story takes place at the airport. I agree your relation is like the movies but this is not a Film. - This is real life. - Be quiet. - Let's go. - What? It's 120 kilometers. His bike will never make it. "I can feel being drawn closer to you." "Becoming aloof from myself." "There has to be a reason..." "...that we met." "Gradually I'm becoming yours." "Slowly I'm becoming yours." "Eventually I'm becoming yours." "Without you..." "I've no existence." Do you know how far we had to push the bike? We had to drag it for 13 whole kilometers. Even the mechanic at the garage asked for RS.2000. Okay,... ...just forget what happened. Uncle I didn't expect this from you. She's gone to London, not Mars. What... Look Susu, don't even think about it. What do you mean? I have made up my mind, uncle. Done for. It's a 10-hour flight. Doesn't matter. Have you lost your mind? It was fine this far. London is a bit too much. Uncle, what do you say? Since you've made up your mind,... ...i am with you. Will you explain them? Have you all lost your minds? What are you laughing at? This will need extensive planning. - Come on. - Uncle. Are you his well-wisher or not. How's he going to get there? One Pound is equal to 90 rupees. He'll be bankrupt. It's not that easy to get there. Even if he gets there, what will he do? She's not in Limbdi, she's in London. Listen to me. - Virgin?. - Yes. I meant the passport. But, we can send him on a student visa. - That's great. - What was your percentage - in final year? - 41 percent. 41 percent. That's too much. We even send those with 35 percent. How? There are many fake colleges out here. Their sole purpose is to provide student visa. That's great, uncle. You'll have to take admission in one such college. The rate starts at 2.5 million. Deposit 500,000 first. I will start the process. There is one way, but there's a risk. I am ok taking a risk. - Morocco. - No, sir. I want to go to London. I am getting to that. From Morocco, you'll get in a container and travel on a cargo ship... ...and go to Calais. And from Calais, you'll have to walk to London through the tunnel. If you're caught, you'll be jailed. But in the UK. But you'll get to the UK. Susu, let's go. Where? Let's go. Don't worry, we'll think of something. I'll close the shop. 'London, Thames River.' 'But no stamp.' You'll get jailed in UK. But you'll get to UK. 'Not a penny in your pocket, and you want to go to UK.' "I wish my dreams come true and you become mine." "And these seasons change." "I wish my dreams come true and you become mine." "And time stops." "If you're with me, I'd share a lot of things. "This is the season of love." "Come to me and stay." "This is the season of love." "I can feel your effect on me..." "...and I am starting to forget this world." "O zealous.." "Dance lover.." "O spirited one." "Your fellow friends are waiting for you." "O zealous.." "Dance lover.." "O spirited one." "Your fellow friends are waiting for you." "O zealous.." "Dance lover.." "O spirited one." "Your fellow friends are waiting for you." "O zealous.." "Dance lover.." "O spirited one." "Your fellow friends are waiting for you." - Cheers. - Cheers. Susu. I have the perfect plan to send you to London. What? You... ...should start walking. You can say that I am walking for World Peace. You'll get there in a year or two maybe. Negative, I am in no mood for jokes. Ohh...then I'll give you a serious idea. - Stop it. - This is a better idea. - Tell me. - Come here. Sell one of your kidneys. We always have one extra kidney. You'll get 500,000 for it. Now laugh. I am in a terrible frame of mind, and you're cracking jokes. What else can I do? It's been 10 months. Even cough syrups expire in 10 months,... ...but you still got a crush on her. - Why you... - Listen... I've found a way to send you to London. How? This Navratri my orchestra group is going to London. You can go with us. Uncle. Well done. Let go. Let go. What's wrong now? Who is going to tell Uncle Hari? Why do you want to go to London? Why are you asking him? Ask him. This guy. What did I do? I am talking to him. Who is going to tell us? Uncle. - You tell them. - Stop wasting my time, and tell me clearly. We're going to London. Why? - To play Garba. - Garba! Son, wasn't our country big enough for you... ...that you now you want to go to London to play Garba. He's going with me. See... See... Your brother is spoiling his life. At least hear us out. - What's left to hear now? - Please calm down. Son, do you have any other goal in life, other than Garba? Right now I only have Garba on my mind. And I am even getting an opportunity to go to London. And for free. Yes, traveling is free. Plus he'll get paid. Yes. By the way, nothing's final yet. He can come along only if he gets a visa. When is the visa interview? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Uncle, why are we all wearing red shirts. It's Tuesday. If you wear a red shirt on Tuesday, you will get the visa. - Ohh... - Oh yes. Just a minute. Put this beetel nut in your right pocket. And these rice flakes... Take it. - Keep it in your left pocket. - You will get the visa. What else do we have to do for a visa? People chants all day. But we are not that superstitious. I don't believe in all that. Go on, it's your turn. Good luck. Hello. Shusrut. Sushrut! So what is the purpose of your visit to the UK? I am going with my uncle, for Garba. Garba. What is Garba? You don't know Garba. I mean...it's... Its divine dance form for the Goddess. - Show it to me. - Sorry. - Garba. - Show it to me. - Here? - I mean over here. Garba. Show me now. What a weird man. Uncle. He wants me to do Garba. Yes, of course. Why not. Get up, guys. Push these at the back. Back. Back. Bring me a chair. Give me that. Bring me a chair. Yes, bring me that. Okay. - Ready. - Ready. 5...6...7...8... "O, Drummer." "O, Drummer." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." "O, Drummer." "O Drummer...beat the drums louder." "On this magical night, you make my heart sway..." "...tinkering your bangles at midnight?" Wow... Good. This is Garba. You're approved. Stop it. He's only going for 15 days. I packed only one back. I've packed Thepla, Khakra, pickles and Laddoos in the other bag. Don't forget to eat them. Take their blessings. We'll miss our flight. We better leave. Go carefully. Rasik. Take care. Let's go. All this for nothing. I mean nothing will happen to them. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, God. This is nice. This is no time to lie down. Let's go. I am not going anywhere. I've got jetleg. - What? - Jetleg. Don't you feel it too? Uncle, that's jetlag. Shut up. Susu, why aren't you dancing? I will when she gets here. "I've been waiting..." "for ages." "But still no news..." "of my beloved." "Yet I believe..." "she isn't disloyal." "Then what is the reason..." "for this wait." Forget it. Today is Sunday. And the pubs in London are just fantastic on Sundays. Let's go to the Pub. - Sunday? - Yeah. Soup Kitchen. Shelter Home. Uncle, you're great. - See you. - Where are you going? What a weird kid. Do you need any help? You good? Here you go. Thank you. Hi. Remember me? Excuse me. So, how have you been? Good. You? Good. Thanks. What brings you to London? I came along with my uncle's Garba group. We have a show here. I know. I saw the posters. And you still didn't show up? Well, I was busy with my friends on a project,... ...and I also had the Shelter home. So, I couldn't make it. How did you find me? It was pretty simple. You told me that night. You remembered. I remember everything about you. You can test me. Manisha. I am sorry. Don't bother. I've already put that behind me. But... Sorry. Hello. Okay. Okay, I am coming. Yes, I am coming. Sorry, Susu. I need to go. Give me your phone. - Huh? - Phone. Let's meet tomorrow. I'll call you tomorrow, yeah. Uncle. - What are you doing, Susu? - Uncle. - Let me sleep. - Look what I got? I don't want to see anything, just let me sleep. - Take a look. - I said I don't want to see. - Please. - Fine, what did you get? I got her number. You never got any number when you were in school or college. What number did you get in London? Uncle, I got Manisha's number. See. We're meeting tomorrow. What are you saying? Yes, Nathan. That's the English language. Unfortunately, your tongue sticks out when you're saying certain words. Nathan. Nathan. Nathan. So there's this slight stress. I hope they get my soy fish right. - My soy fish. - This is.. - I dare you to open it. - Really? - Really? - No, don't. - Hello - Hello Guys, this is my friend Susu from India. - Hello. - Hi. Susu, this is Nathan. That's Sarah. And this is Kate. Hello. Hi. I've heard so much about India from her. I am just dying to go there. Funny. Why funny? Because I am dying to come here, you're dying to go there. We both are dying. Susu. I've never heard that name before. What does it mean? So... So my dad... It's named after a holy man. Like a great sage. - Wow...holy man. - A sage. Hey, it's my boy Chris. Hey... - Hey, how are you doing? - How are you? Looking smart. - You're looking lovely. - Thank you. Hello. Hi. Susu, that's Chris. Susu. Cool name, mate. You all right? Okay. So, how was the interview? All right, listen to this. We get to the end, and this guy's like the main hiring guy at Bloomberg. He looks at me and goes "Well, how much are you expecting". And I am like, "I'd be happy with 50,000". And there's a pause and he leans in. "I am going to give you 60." Just like that. 60,000 a year. And I am starting on Monday. Oh wow! I can't believe it. - Congratulations. - That's amazing. Yeah... Drinks. Drinks. Drinks. We need drinks over here. - Drinks on me. - We need drinks over here.

So where do we take Susu? I think the Salsa bar. Susu will like it, I mean... You know, I like Salsa once... (Football Commentary) What is this? Negative was right, Uncle. We have nothing in common. Look, I am already high, I've had too many drinks. So stop your yapping. And let me drink. What nonsense. Rocket and you kept provoking me, and I went with the flow. I even came to London for her. But not anymore. This chapter is over. Now back to Pavilion. Game over, uncle. It's all over. What's over? Have you lost your mind? What's over? You alright, mate. I am sorry. Sorry. Sorry. He's my nephew. He's my nephew. My baby. Sorry. He...is in love. True love. This place... Makeup, breakup, patch up, and all that. But we...are Indian. Our love spans for many lifetimes.

These people taught us how to love. - Aamir Khan. - Aamir Khan, you know. - Aamir Khan. - Of course. Yes. He takes a bullet in the chest. For love. Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. Shahrukh Khan. Shahrukh Khan. You know Shahrukh Khan. Yes. Shahrukh Khan. He spent 20 years in jail, for two days. For a two-day love. Veer Zaara. Yes, Veer Zaara. Thank you. For Veer Zaara. For love. Salman Khan. Salman Khan. You know Salman Khan? - Yes... - He shaved his head. He shaved his hair. And gave up his life. For love. In Tere Naam. That is how we love. That is how we love. Man. What is over, Susu? Why are you being so negative? That Chris, or whoever he is, he's no match for you. He is not. Hey! Back then it was Navratri. And it's Navratri now. Anything is possible in these 9 days! Don't be negative. Go to her. Just go. Tell him please, tell him. Go get her. - Go get her! - Go get the girl! Go get her! Go get the girl! - Go get the girl! - Go! Go! Go! - Uncle. - Go! Go! Go!

Sushrut Sushrut, stop. Sushrut Sushrut Why did you leave so suddenly? What's wrong? Everything. Everything is wrong. What do you mean everything is wrong? I mean everything is wrong. Nothing like this should've happened. You coming to Baroda in Navratri. Us meeting. Staying out all night. Garba night. Visiting your mom's NGO. Me coming to London. Meeting you again. Nothing like this should've happened. What are you saying? What are you talking about? Oh, man... ...I've got an attachment for you. I am from a small city, after all. A beautiful girl comes down, talks to me sweetly. sat on my scooter's backseat. And that was it. That was all the hint I needed. Without considering that our lifestyles are different. Our lives are different. Our habits are different. Your father was right. But I never understand things easily. Even though I knew that you have a boyfriend in London, I still came over. Hoping that maybe you... But sorry, after meeting this Michelle from London I realized... ...I was just a weekend love. No update, guys. Hello, why are you sounding so low? It's nothing. There's nothing left here for me. You sound sad. Forget it. I was happy without a reason last Navratri... ...and this time I am getting sad. - There's no point. - Why are you sounding so negative? Did you give up so easily? Did you travel all the way to London from India just so that you can give up? Negative, you're saying this? Negative is no longer Negative, Susu. He's become positive now. - How? - Negative's scored with... Khusboo. Negative, you got a girl too. Don't worry, you'll get yours too. No. It's time for my love to expire. And anyway, she is with Chris. I see. Like they say, made for each other. Ha, ha. And that's not me. - Did she say that to you? - No. Then how can you assume it on your own? One can tell. There's no way for you to tell. Susu, why don't you clearly ask about Chris. Look Susu, forget about everything else. You should straight away ask her about her feelings. Think about it Susu and then decide. Look Susu, don't take a hasty decision. Are you listening to me. Hello. Hello. Answer me, Susu. I'll call you back later. See. Remember the giant wheel in Baroda. Just like that. Then you must remember what I explained to you back there. I explained to you that there's a huge gap between Michelle and you. So why did you come here? I won't lie, sir. I came to meet Manisha. Wasting your time, boy. She's with her boyfriend Chris now. Go back to India. Sir, he's her boyfriend. Let her speak for herself. Or, are you going to do that too. Meaning? Sir, you left India behind... ...but, you couldn't get rid of this Indian dad attitude. Her life, her decisions, she can take it herself. Indian dads can go to any limits for her daughter. Got it? You don't know who I am. I know, sir. You own a chain of laundries. You're an expert in washing. For example, you brainwashed me last year. And I ended up arguing with Manisha. What did you think? You can brainwash me again. Go back to India. Go bloody fool, idiot. I am not a big idiot, sir. And why do you keep showing me giant wheels all the time? Do you know the wheel keeps spinning? The one on the top comes down. And the one who's at the bottom, also goes on the top, sir. Isn't it, sir. You'll go to the top. How? By playing Garba. Isn't that what you want? Starting your own Garba academy. Please stop worrying about what I want. Do you even know what your own daughter wants? You know that she wants to go back to India and start her mother's NGO. But you want her to do MBA. Make her a money-minting machine like you. Isn't it? You're right. Come with me. What are you doing, sir? What are you doing, sir? Sir, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? You're under arrest. "The number you're trying to call is currently not reachable." Stop it guys. Susu's missing, and you guys are busy beating drums. What's going on? Uncle. where is Susu? You're asking me about Susu. He's always with you, so you should know where is Susu. We didn't talk after last night's argument. I don't know where he is That's the problem! Just tell him whatever is on your mind. Even though he knew that Chris is your boyfriend... ...he came all the way to London from Baroda for you. Chris? My boyfriend. Says who? Your dad. Back in Baroda... ...your dad told Susu... ...that Chris is your boyfriend, and a lot more to brainwash him. But where is Sushrut now? A black Mercedes stopped outside our guesthouse... ..And Sushrut got in it. I don't know where. Manisha. Sir, he doesn't like me because I like his daughter. He's playing silly games. Sir, I didn't break the glass, he broke the glass. Sir, please believe me. I don't want to work in London, sir. I want to go back to India. I came to London for her. Sir, this is not a criminal matter. This is a matter of love. Please help me. - Jignesh. - Bhavesh. What do you think? Are you two Gujarati? - Where are you from? - Karamsad. - Borsad - Born there. Brought up here. Sir, myself Sushrut. From Baroda. I am a Garba teacher - Jignesh. - Bhavesh. He's a Gujarati boy. From Baroda. From my in-law's place. Then you can definitely understand, sir. Indian father. He's trying to get me into trouble. He can't get you in trouble. Now we'll get him in trouble. Dad, we need to talk. What's wrong? What's the problem? What is your problem? Why do you take everything from me that gives me happiness? Mom! Nattu Uncle! Sushrut! I need an answer, dad. Why do you want to control everything in my life? I feel suffocated. I was only 4-years-old when you came to London. And I stayed back in Baroda with mom. I was only 10 when mom finally passed away waiting for you. That's when you came to India. This time to take me with you. When you were busy making this empire... ...did it ever occur to you how will a 12-year-old girl... ...survive in this place without friends or family. But still, I molded myself according to you. And the love I kept craving for... ...if I was getting it from Sushrut, you won't approve of that either. Why don't you want to see my happy, papa? Why? I know why. Because you've made your expectations my ambitions. But sorry, papa. I cannot live this fake life anymore. I don't want this. I want to be myself. I want to live. I want to go back to India. Why don't you understand, papa? I want to go back. Fulfill mom's dreams. Can I say something, dear? A father and daughter's relationship... ...cannot be explained. My expectations are not your ambitions. Your expectations are my ambitions. "It's the night of dance. Forget everything." "This is the season of love." "Come to me..." "...and stay here." "It's the season of love." "It's the night of dance. Forget everything." "This is the season of love." "Come to me..." "...and stay here." "It's the season of love." "If you be mine..."

And remember... We're not arresting you because of this boy. Otherwise, we can clearly see on the CCTV camera who broke the car's window. So brother, stop playing dirty games. And let's play Garba. "O zealous.." "Dance lover.." "O spirited one." "Your fellow friends are waiting for you." "O zealous.." "Dance lover.." "O spirited one." "Your fellow friends are waiting for you."

Even Sushrut's life changed around... His dreams of opening a Garba Academy finally came true. Two negatives make a positive in Algebra. Something similar happened between Negative and Khusboo. This jealousy made Rocket fly all the way to London. And finally received love from Kate. Sam doesn't just wash the queen's gown anymore... ...he's also washing tunics and traditional dresses.
