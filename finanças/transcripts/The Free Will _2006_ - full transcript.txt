Der Freie Wille (The Free Will) **** Encoded by Jalucian **** For other high quality encodes, visit: Theo! Hey, guys! Hey! Butt-fucker! Let go of me! You fucking bastard! Let go! Let go of me! Shut up, or I'll kill you! Don't! Don't! Please. Don't. Cunt! Cunt! Cunt! Cunt! - Shit! - Pig! Bastard! I feel pretty good about it. I think I've reached the point. I know there's no guarantee... that everything will work out okay, but... it's good I know that. I'll look after myself. I'll take advantage of the opportunities I get. Okay. I'm Sascha. Hi, Theo. You'll be staying in our shared apartment in Muhlheim. On probation. If you get in trouble, you'll be back here in no time. How long were you here? 9 years and 4 months. 4 years ago, I was granted leave, under supervision of a therapist. And 2 years ago, I stopped taking sex drive inhibitors. For the last 6 months I've been given day leave and had to return to the facility in the evening. And now I'm finally getting released. - Hello, Ms. Neumann. - Hello. Toilet. Bathroom. This is the kitchen. Ingo, Ralle... Hi. Hi, I'm Theo. Everything okay? My room. It's comfy. The living room. That's Marius's room, but he's out. Welcome home. I know the doctors tell you guys this is a big opportunity and all. But the guys who live here call the front door "the gate to hell." This is gonna be fucking hard for you. So prepare yourself. Make the best of it, Theo. What's wrong with him? He's lonely. - Hello, are you getting along all right? - Yeah, I'm looking around a bit. Of course. Are you looking for a nice jacket? Yeah, sure... - What size do you have there? - I think it's a baggy large. That's for men who are a bit shorter and stockier. - Not the right size for you, is it? - No. You could use medium to large. We have other jackets over there. A super color for you. - It looks good on you. - Yeah... - The right size, too. With jeans... - Too long. Or corduroys. - Too long? - Yeah. Have a look at this one. That's a more classic sweater, light wool. A slight pattern. You can wear it with cotton or virgin wool pants. And the color goes well with lots of things. - Can I go to the toilet? - Sure. Hey, you look good. Theo got out 4 days ago. Correctional facility trained him to be a printer. - Psychiatric Detention... - He lives with us and needs a job. Yes, okay. Why were you there? Rape in conjunction with... grievous bodily harm. How often? Three... I abused 3 women. Why didn't they put you in prison? Because the doctors felt I was ill... And they thought it was better to help me instead of locking me up. And now you're no longer ill? Yes... I mean no. I'm healthy again. Yes, well... This may sound a bit strange, but... I'd like to be a kind of role model. I was locked up, but I know what it's like outside. I watched TV. Unemployment, social neglect and so on. I read a statistic that an average teen has sex for the first time at the age of 12. I don't want to sound like a wiseguy. I'm sorry, but... I just want to do my job. And I want to show it's possible to live a normal, healthy life, even if you started out wrong. Nonsense. This is nonsense. We're out of meat sauce. Would you like something else? Penne with walnut pesto is pretty good. Or tagliatelle with mushroom ragout. We also have rigatoni al forno, topped with cheese and baked. Or fettuccini with pine nuts and parmesan cheese and olive oil and garlic. - I'll take that. - Okay. Here. For the early shift. Thanks. - How's it going? - Fine. ...8, 9, 10... ...11. My therapist and I went over it second by second to find out how it happened. So I can stop it the next time I feel something brewing. Like how? Like deliberately going back to the facility. The problem is, I think something's brewing. It isn't so strong, but... How did you notice? The waitress. - That young girl at the pizzeria? - Yeah. I thought you liked her. Sure, I like her, but somehow I don't like her either. Understand? It isn't that bad. It's still on the safe side. Find somebody else. It's no problem if you do the bookkeeping just once. - I'm not going to do it anymore, Dad. - Where do you want to work? This is all you know how to do, sweetheart. Theo, come on in. Come in. This is Nettie, my daughter. She does... she did the bookkeeping. - Theo. - Hi... Dad, I'm leaving now. - Yeah. See you later. - See you later. Yeah, she's moving out. Now she's really moving out. I'm going back to work. Hello, Mr. Engelbrecht. Dad? - What are you doing here? - The doctor's appointment is tomorrow. My mistake. Is everything okay? Yes. Dad... - I'm leaving now, Dad. - Just a moment. It's okay, Dad. - In the corner? - Mmh. Here's the last load. - Thank you. Yeah. - My pleasure. Hey, we could go out and do something. No, I'm tired. I gotta unpack the boxes. No, please don't. I thought you didn't want to anymore. Right? Yeah, sure. I mean... You're right. I... I'm sorry. Yes... Well... I guess I'll go home. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? Sascha, it's me, Theo. I... Oh, hi, Theo. What's up? Hey, Ralle. Just cool it! It doesn't work. It just won't work... - It doesn't work. What doesn't work? - It... Hey, guys. Not so loud! It just doesn't work. - It just doesn't work at all. - It doesn't work? Where are you? Wanna come here? - Sascha! - Just a minute. I'm on the phone. Theo? Hello? I just sit there and... The others are there, too. - And there's nothing. - Nothing? What do you mean? Inside me, there's nothing. Uh... you sit there and uh... there's nothing... So what happens? - Understand what I mean? - I don't know. Not exactly. When I'm... Not until I get home... ...and I'm alone. Then I feel something. Listen, Theo. You can't solve your problem when you think about it the whole time. Go out and talk to girls. - What? - What do you have to lose? Just try it. Make a fool of yourself. We all make fools of ourselves sometime. Sascha? Dad... I'm sorry. I really didn't hear it this morning. It doesn't matter. Really. Don't even think about it. It's just so terrible, so embarrassing when your back no longer allows you... When I can't bend down and tie... But it really isn't your problem. - I haven't seen you for ages. - Ages? I didn't want you to get upset. I'm sorry that... Hey, Dad... Listen. I just moved out a week ago. - Do you feel better alone? - That's not the point. What is the point? That it's embarrassing to live with your father at the age of 27. - When can I see your apartment? - When it's fixed up and not a dump. I want to bring you a house-warming present. - I want you and your boyfriend... - I don't have a boyfriend. - I don't want to bother you two. - Listen, Dad... - I'm going to... - Mr. Engelbrecht, the doctor will see you now. Fine... No, no, everything's okay. Thank you. Yes, I'm coming. See you later. I know none of them can stand me. But now I understand why. I'm a rather pathetic person. I realize that now, 'cause I'm heartless... Yes. It sounds quite cruel, but I think it's true. I always wanted to be somebody, to do something better than the others, so they'd love me, but... In the meantime I realize that was the very reason why nobody ever really loved me, not even your mother... to be honest. It's all my own fault... Really. I won't even complain when my own daughter despises... - Dad! I can't stand this anymore. I'm going to get up and walk away... and break off all contact with you. - Hi there. - Hi. I wanted to ask you if we could go for a drink. No, I'm sorry. I don't want to. - Okay? - Okay. Here are the sauces. Daniel's the boss here. He'll tell you what to do. Over here are the vegetables. Richard's the boss here. When he tells you what to do, then you do it, okay? - Richard, this doesn't seem to work. - I'll get you another one. Oh, yes it does. I have to turn it. Sorry about that. No problem. Hi there. Hi. - Hello. - I have a problem. I have to buy corn. And I have to get back there at once, or they'll slaughter me. Think you could lend me some money? - Yeah, how much? - Like maybe 20. Great. Thanks a lot. I can give it back to you tonight after work. Where? Listen, this isn't getting anywhere. I don't like men. I don't want anything to do with 'em. So let's just skip the conversation. That's convenient. I'm not very fond of women either. Well, that's great. - A cup of tea. - 1.60, please. - Thanks. - A cup of tea. What do you mean, you aren't so fond of women? Huh? You guys use the most stupid tricks just to put the moves on us... It makes me sick! It's no trick. It's just like I said. Sorry if you got the wrong idea. I'm going. Cunt! You cunt! - Where's Marius? - Back at detention. - Why's that? - Better that way. I'm going back to Berlin. Wanna come along? What about Berlin? What about the apartment? - I'm out. - Why's that? The Welfare Office is full of idiots. You know that. They fired me. How about it? Wanna come along? Berlin's cool. - Hello? - Hi, it's me, Nettie. - Hi. Where'd you get my number? - Information. Am I disturbing you? I'll call you back tomorrow. What did you call for? I wanted to apologize for the last time. Ice cream parlor? I thought we could go for coffee and talk and all. Again. Well... talking might not be such a good idea. Yeah, maybe you're right. Theo! - That was good... the movie. - The movie? Yeah, I thought so, too. Okay, take care. And lots of luck with Nettie. It's an opportunity, and you don't get many. Wise ass! You're gonna miss my wisecracks, old man! Take care of yourself. - Hello. - Hello. You got your stuff with you? - I think I'd better leave. - No, no. It's great you came. You can get changed over there. - Yeah? - Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Around the corner and to the right. Okay, you... choke me. Go back a step and then hit. Everyone hits like everybody else. You decide how hard you hit. - Take care. - Bye. See ya. You're still here. Yeah... I'm sorry. It's okay. Will I see you again? I'm going away for a while. To the seaside, to Belgium. I'm doing an internship at a terrific chocolate factory. Well then... ...good luck. Thanks... Same to you. - Bye. - See ya. Hello, madame. Hello? I booked a room for Engelbrecht. Of course. Just a moment, please. Here is the room. - Here is the key. - Thank you. Oh, there's no soap. I'll get you some. Would you like shampoo, too? No, I have some. - You speak good French. - Thank you. It takes all night to melt 100 kilograms of chocolate. This chocolate is from Ghana. It's 70 percent cocoa. It's no problem if the cellophane is too long. Hello, can I help you? This is from the summer collection. Very sporty. You might like it. - I always go there... - Yes? ...and pick it out myself. - Really? At the market? I know a seller with a wide selection, and that's where I get the ginger. I sometimes make a certain drink for myself when I feel sick. - Really? - Yes. With ginger. I chop it into small pieces, pour hot water onto it, and, like you said, I add cayenne pepper and maple syrup. - Really? - It's so good. I've never used maple syrup. There's no sugar added to maple syrup. It has a very special taste. What're you doing here? How did you find me? Information. I don't have time for you now. That's okay. It's my first time in Belgium. Where are you going to stay? I'll get a hotel room. You won't find a room. The hotels are all seasonal. They're all closed. I'll find a place. Do you have a room? No room? - It's okay. I got a room. - Okay. Sleep tight. Yeah, thanks. What're you doing? They got no rooms here. Yeah, I got the picture. So, why didn't you tell me that? - I can't do it. - You can't do it? What? Everything. I can't do it. Come on. Come on. There's a bed in there. Theo. Theo. Hello. How are you? And you? Yeah... I have a surprise... tomorrow. Okay. Sit down there, okay? A bookcase? A sofa bed. This is a sofa bed. Are you coming? Just a moment. Don't move. Take off your clothes. - Do you like my tits? - Yes. - They're too old, aren't they? Too old. - What? - Your tits? Nonsense. - Yeah. Yes, they are. - They look old. Don't look at them. - No, they don't. - Yes, they do. They do! They do! - Nonsense. Nonsense. It's strange, 'cause they've always looked old. No, they don't. Yes, they do. Look, sorry. They do. That's the way they are. Stop that! - You're crazy. You're crazy. - Huh? - I'm not crazy. And that's the truth. - No. Yes... You have to get out if you don't stop it. Yummy. - Yeah? - Mmh. Oh God! Theo? Look at me. I love you. It's so nice. What? To look at you... ...and to be able to say that. To be able to hear my voice when I say it. - Hi, it's me. - Hi there. I wanted to tell you that I'll be home a bit later today, okay? It's Thommi's last day, and I'm at the Lux with him and the others. You don't have to wait for me. I'm a bit drunk, but no problem. - Everything's okay. See you, honey. Bye. - Okay, bye. Hello? Get lost! Let go! What do you want from me? Are you crazy? You asshole! What did you call me? What did you call me? Huh? Asshole? Asshole? You cunt! Cunt! Slut! You bitch! Hi. Well? - Was it good? - Yeah, it was good. It was good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Who was there? Wilms and Thommi... Why are you eating? It's too late to be eating. - I got hungry again. - It isn't good for your body. It isn't good. Hi there. - Did you have a nice evening? - I stink, don't I? It's okay. I gotta go wash myself. I don't feel so good. - I gotta go. - Yeah. Is everything okay? Yeah. Okay. Nettie! Theo? Hey? Theo? Hey, wait! - Theo? - It won't work. - I can't do it. - What? I just can't do it. It's over. Hey! What did you say? You don't love me, and I don't love you. So let's forget it. - You're lying! - No! I don't love you. You don't know what you're saying. You don't know anything. You don't know a single thing! Stop it. Please, stop it. Before I came here, I was locked up for 9 years. I raped 3 women. First I beat 'em up, and then I fucked 'em. I stripped one of 'em, on the hot oven... I wanted... I wanted everything to be good between us. I wanted it to stop. But it's inside me. Always... always. And it'll never stop. I know that now. Did you hear me? I know it'll never stop. - Did you...? - Yeah. Yesterday. I lied to you. I've been lying to you the whole time. I don't love you. I hate you! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Don't you understand? I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Come on in. I'm a piece of shit. - Hello? Yes. - Ms. Anja Schattschneider? - I'd like to talk to you. - What about? About Theo Stoer. Please... Get out! - And one espresso. You're welcome. - Thank you. Thank you. It's been 8 years since anybody asked me about it. And you? What? Me? What? How...? Doesn't matter. No, it does matter. I mean... You don't have to talk about it. Not here. Not at all. It isn't like that. I'm not a victim. - I'm sorry. I didn't want... - What didn't you want? Who gave you the right to look for me? How did you find me anyway? A person I know, from a newspaper in Muhlheim. What do you want from me? Theo... Theo... Theo... ...is a friend. A friend? I wanted to see you and talk to you. Excuse me. I have to... Hey, sweetheart! Don't! - Don't! - Oh yes! Don't! - Yes? - Hello, Sascha. It's me, Nettie. - Nettie? ...Hi, how are you? - Hmm. - How are you? - Great. I mean, Berlin's a bit wilder than Muhlheim, you know? No. What're you doing? Me? Oh. All sorts of stuff. I watch lots of TV. Terranova, Discovery Channel, Amazing Planet... - Hey! - Stuff like that. Yeah? Is Theo staying with you now? Theo? No, he isn't staying here. I'm sorry. I see. Okay. I gotta hang up now. Yeah, sure. Take care of yourself. Bye. I'm gonna finish taking a shit. A croissant, please. - Excuse me, there's a man... - Yes? What? Pardon? Nothing. Thank you. Great, very good. Yes. I've already thought of it, Ms. Gerhard. Yes, I have. Yes, that's great. - Stoer. - Yes. That's fine. I'll send a brochure for your sister, too. Yes, I will. Yes, like I promised. Have a nice evening. Yes, of course. Sure thing... Theo! Give it to me. Theo! - Theo, give it to me! Theo! - No! Theo? Theo... Theo... Don't! Don't...
