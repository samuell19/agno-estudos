Small fry, and here's your toy. A Zurg belt buckle? Can I get a Buzz Lightyear instead? We're all out of Buzzes. Well, can she have that one? I'm sorry, those are for display only. Thanks anyways. Come on, Bonnie. See? I told you we're never gonna get played with. But we're just here to sell chicken. - All right! Ball pit! - Hey, hey, wait a minute. Splash! I think I just found our ticket to playtime. Come on, let's go! I better not. I don't wanna get in trouble with the chicken people. Fine. You stay here with the belt buckle. Me, I'm gonna get played with! See ya, Zurgy! Oh, boy. Oh, no! Hot lava! - Splash! - Come on, Bonnie! Coming! I love playtime! It's a little unsanitary, but... Playtime's the best! Bonnie, don't forget your toys. Hi, toys. Bye, toys. Hi, everybody! We're home! Hey, welcome back! How was Poultry... What smells like chicken fingers? I'm Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace. What happened to Buzz? He says the plastic in the ball pit made him shrink! Yeah, yeah, that's right, Tex. Say, when's the playtime start around here? All right, where's the real Buzz? Blast. Well, hello! Welcome to the support group for discarded Fun Meal toys. We're just about to begin. T-Bone? Would you find him a seat? Right this way, sir. I think there's been a mistake. You see, I was just left in the ball pit, and I... Oh, we've all been left in the ball pit of life, haven't we? Yes, Tae-Kwon Doe? You have a question? What? Oh, I'm sorry, this is just my play feature. Hi-yah! That's super. Now, why don't we just go around the room and introduce ourselves? My name is Neptuna. Hi, Neptuna. I was from the Mermaid Battle Squadron tie-in. Summer '98. I was thrown away, and that's okay. I'm T-Bone, leader of the Steak Force. We battled the Vegi-Tanarians for dinner table dominance. Well, I never got played with. G'day. The name's Koala Kopter from the Down-Underables. I got swapped for a Kangaroo Kanoe! My name is Recycle Ben and I got recycled! I don't get it. Why don't the kids like me? I'm like history, but on wheels! Nobody wanted to board the Vampire Express. My name is Roxy Boxy. I was recalled because... Sorry. I mean, who wants to see an accurate depiction of the human nervous system when they're chowing down on a burger! Kid not like Pizza Bot. Pizza Bot sad. - My name is Buzz. - Hi, Buzz. And I need to go. Wait, don't run away from your problems, brother. Look, I need to get back to my friends. We're your friends now, Buzz. Look around you. We've all been discarded and we need to stick together. - Isn't that right, Super Pirate? - Yar. The playtime's coming super soon Doc-dab, doc-dab Guys, I'm telling you, this is the real Buzz! Doo-doo-didley-doo-doo-doo Oh, playtime day Rex, he's like three inches tall. Yeah, but he's a pretty good ice dancer. Well, I'm gonna go find out what happened to our friend. Little Buzz guy! Oh, playtime day Listen, about this playtime... Playtime? Hey, I'll be the cowboy! Hey! Come back here! Get along, little piggy! Hee-haw! Could somebody tackle him, please? Playtime is your friend Thank you. Even though I have been thrown away, I am not garbage. How am I gonna get up there? All right, everyone, this is a good time for some re-enactment therapy. Let's break into groups of two. And let's have Beef Stewardess with Ghost Burger. Bozu the Ninja Clown with Funky Monk. Wassup? - And then Condorman with DJ Blu-Jay. - All right! Lizard Wizard? I'm gonna put you with Buzz. Now Buzz, you are a child who has received this toy. Pick him up and play with him. Oh, boy. Play, play, play. Good. Now, to simulate the abandonment, discard him. - What? - And walk over there next to Gary Grappling Hook. Gary Grappling Hook? Hey there. So, wouldn't it be more devastating if I left the room? Oh, what a fabulous idea! Thank you, Buzz. Gary, do you mind? Yeah, sure, whatever. Whoa! Oh, yeah! That was awesome. Now, how did that make you feel? Well, let's see now. It made me happy when I was played with, -but sad when he left. - Good. Okay, good, hold that thought. We're going to have Buzz come back in now. Buzz? - He left. - No! Okay. To save Buzz, we need to find a way to get inside Poultry Palace. So, I used to work at Poultry Palace. You like honey mustard sauce? Yeah, you do. Come on, guys, think. How do we get inside? We could jimmy the lock. Let's act our way in! We could drive a truck through the front door! - Or, you could use the drive-through. - Buzz! You're back! So, what do you have to say for yourself, Space Ranger? I've done some things that I'm not proud of. I've spent a lot of playtime thinking I was the prize that came with the meal, but with the help of my sponsor, I know now that the real prize is inside of each and every one of us. Sorry. Oh, that was a good one. Belt Buckle, you crack me up sometimes.
