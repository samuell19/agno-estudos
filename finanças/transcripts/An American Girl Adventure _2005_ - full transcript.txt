(HOOVES POUNDING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) FELICITY: My grandfather always told me to embrace the changes that life brings. But it wasn't until last spring, on my tenth birthday, that I truly understood how very difficult change could be. Whoa, Bess. NAN: There you are, Felicity. Good morning, Nan. Mother's been looking for you. 'Tis a beautiful morning for a ride, don't you think? Gentlewomen do not sit astride a horse. Oh, Nan. Says who? Gentlewomen do not sit astride a horse. Yes, ma'am. Felicity, help me with the apple butter, please. Today is your tenth birthday and you're growing into quite an independent young lady. It's time for you take on more responsibility. FELICITY: Cooking is so much work. And afterwards it's all gone. 'Tis true, there's nothing left that anyone can see, but it gives me great pleasure knowing that I provided for my family. I want you to be a notable housewife when you grow up. One who gains pleasure by doing things for others. (DOOR THUDS) GRANDFATHER: Hello, everyone. BOTH: Grandfather. You've arrived. Oh, my precious children. How have you been? NAN: Quite well, Grandfather. But Felicity was riding astride a horse. Oh, well, it is her birthday. I suppose we can forgive her that. Can't we, Nan? Lissie, hurry quickly to the store. If I'm to bake your favorite cake, we'll need more sugar. But Grandfather just arrived. Grandfather needs to rest before dinner and you need to run to the store, young lady. Straight away, Mother. Father. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) WOMAN: Good day, Felicity. MAN: Whoa. Steady, steady. Miss. FELICITY: Good afternoon, Marcus. Afternoon, Miss Felicity. Good afternoon, Ben. Is Father here? Good afternoon, Miss Felicity. Your father's in the counting room. Could I be of service? A cone of sugar, please. (GIRL CHATTERING) That's the most beautiful shade of green. It would make a splendid ballgown. (LAUGHING) Ballgown? What use would a ballgown be in this place? They probably don't even know how to dance. We have grand dances here. Felicity Merriman. ANNABELLE: Merriman? The shopkeeper's daughter? Yes. I beg your pardon, Miss Merriman, but I doubt you have the kind of dances we're accustomed to. Lady Templeton's Christmas Eve ball is the grandest in all the colonies. I'm sure it is. Come, Bitsy. In a moment, Annabelle. I'm Elizabeth Cole. Pleased to meet you. You must forgive my sister. She woke up in a disagreeable mood. (CHUCKLING) Several years ago. MR. COLE: Shall we go, my dear? Father, this is Felicity Merriman. I'm pleased to see our Elizabeth has made a new friend. You see, we've just arrived from England. I'm ready, Father. (HORSE NEIGHING) MR. COLE: Miss Merriman. Elizabeth? It was a pleasure to meet you, Felicity. And you, Elizabeth. Ah. Is this Mistress Merriman? Father. To what do I owe this pleasant surprise? (GIGGLING) Father. Mother's baking a ginger cake for my birthday. Oh. Ben, do you know that our Felicity is 10 years old today? Congratulations, Miss Felicity. May I stay and help Ben and Marcus? No, there's really no need. Oh, but it's no trouble... Felicity, you really must learn to listen. (WOMAN CHATTERING) MR. MERRIMAN: The answer was no. Lady Templeton. What a pleasure. Mr. Merriman. And Felicity? (LADY TEMPLETON GASPS) I hardly recognize you. Today is Felicity's birthday. Well, that explains it. Well, I must say, you're growing into a fine young lady. (GIGGLING) Thank you, ma'am. Are you practicing your dancing? Felicity's really not much for dancing. She'd much rather spend time at the stables. Oh, speaking of which, can you have your man bring round a sack of oats to my house? Why, certainly. My, uh, my apprentice will be delivering a bit and bridle to Jiggy Nye at the tannery. I'll have him stop by your home directly afterwards, madam. Jiggy Nye doesn't deserve a horse, much less a bridle. I do believe he beat his last horse to death. He's a cold-hearted scoundrel, if you ask me. But let's not waste our time on that. Ben. (FELICITY GROANS) May I walk with you? If you can keep up. I would dearly love to be able to wear breeches. Beg your pardon? Breeches. Like yours. Gowns and petticoats are so bothersome. Small steps are supposed to be ladylike, but they don't get you anywhere. What are you laughing at? You should try to wear a petticoat one day. You'd see. You are a strange child, Felicity Merriman. I'm not so much younger than you, Benjamin Davidson. I'm no child. Men in petticoats. Sometimes it's very tiresome to be a girl. There are so many things you mustn't do. You mustn't walk too quickly. You mustn't talk too loudly. You mustn't be impatient. (SIGHS) You're so lucky to be a boy. You can do whatever you like. I can't do whatever I like. I'm an apprentice, I have no freedom. How silly. Of course you have freedom. Not to join the militia? Till my contract is up with your father, I must work in his store. I'd gladly trade places to work in Father's store any day. MAN: Good day to you, young miss. (HORSE NEIGHING) The smell is enough to make your hair curl. (HORSE CONTINUES NEIGHING) (DOG BARKS) JIGGY NYE: Hold still, will you? (HORSE NEIGHING) I ought to tan your hide while you're still wearing it. She's a splendid horse. BEN: Aye. Thoroughbred, I'd say. Look at her color. Like a bright new copper penny. That's what I would name her if she were mine. Penny. You vile monster, you. She's a wild one. No, not wild. She's independent. (SHOUTS) (SNORTING) I'll beat the fire out of you. You beast. What's he doing to her? Stop. Don't do that. Hold it. Stay back. (JIGGY NYE GROANING) Run, Penny. Run. (GROANING) (NEIGHING) You wretched beast. (PENNY NEIGHS) Get away with you. You spooked my horse. You spooked your horse yourself. And what do you want? I've got the bits you ordered from Master Merriman, sir. Give it here, then. I'm to wait for payment, sir. Oh, you are, are you? Well, keep your blasted bit. And get away with you before I shoot you. Shoot you for trespassing. FELICITY: Penny was tugging at the rope, trying to get away. But then the horrible Jiggy Nye raised his whip... Felicity. Felicity. Sit. Thank you, Rose. Nye was such a decent fellow. 'Tis a shame indeed. As I recall, no one knew horses as well. But then his wife passed on, and he began drinking, and I... Perhaps we could choose a more suitable mealtime topic. You're quite right, my dear. Felicity, your father and I have a surprise for you. A surprise? May I have one? It's for her birthday. Now that you're 10, we've decided it's time for you to begin your education. Oh, am I to be apprenticed like Ben? Oh, shall I be working in your store? Goodness, no. You are to be educated as a gentlewoman. I don't want to be a gentlewoman. I do. You'll have your turn when you're 10. Felicity, your lessons will begin in two days. You will be educated by a very respectable lady named Miss Frances Manderly. She will instruct you in penmanship, dance, stitchery, the proper way to serve tea... Tea? Lessons on how to serve tea? A lady's manners are judged by the way she serves tea. My mother brought her best teapot with her when she came to Virginia from England. She used to always say, "The King himself would be at home at my tea table." I don't see why anybody would want the King at their tea table. I beg your pardon? (MR. MERRIMAN CLEARS THROAT) Ben, I wonder if you would be kind enough to escort Felicity to her lesson? Aye, sir. Why do I need an escort? A young lady does not arrive unescorted at a gathering. Thank you. And a young lady does not constantly ask questions. Why not? **(BAND PLAYING) May I try your signal whistle? Only a soldier can use it in case of emergency. You're no soldier. I will be someday. This is serious business. A little whistle? Soon, it won't matter if you know how to serve tea. It will be too expensive to buy, thanks to the King and his ridiculous tax. You'd best not say any disrespectful things about the King in front of Grandfather. Disrespectful? Is it not disrespectful of the King to tax us without listening to our voices? **(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) BEN: How I envy them. To be able to fight for our independence. Grandfather says nothing is worth going to war over. The ability to govern ourselves is. Here we are at your lessons. (WOMEN CHATTERING) Enjoy your tea. WOMAN: Come along. Miss Merriman? Miss Felicity Merriman, may I present Miss Annabelle Cole and Miss Elizabeth Cole. Felicity. Hello, Elizabeth. Annabelle. We're taking lessons with the shopkeeper's daughter? My father's store is the finest in all of Williamsburg. Probably in all the 13 colonies. The King of England himself... Ladies, your parents have entrusted me with the important task of preparing you to take your places in society. Our time together will be pleasant and civil. Understood? ALL: Yes, ma'am. MISS MANDERLY: A gentlewoman must behave perfectly at the tea table, both as a hostess and as a guest. Now observe, young ladies. Miss Cole, would you care for tea? Thank you, Miss Manderly. Milk or sugar, Miss Cole? Milk, please. Thank you, Miss Manderly. Would you care for tea, Miss Cole? Yes, please. Thank you, Miss Manderly. Milk or sugar, Miss Cole? Milk please. Thank you, Miss Manderly. Miss Merriman, would you care for tea? Yes. Thank you, Miss Manderly. Milk or sugar, Miss Merriman? Milk and sugar. Thank you, Miss Manderly. Would you care for a cake or a biscuit, Miss Merriman? No, thank you, Miss Manderly. Miss Merriman, you are not drinking because you are thirsty, or eating because you are hungry. The tea and biscuits are offered as a sign of your hostess' hospitality. If you refuse them, you are refusing her generosity. Yes. Thank you, Miss Manderly. This does bring up an excellent point. One may not wish to drink tea all afternoon. (GIRLS GIGGLE) There is a polite way to show you've had enough. You merely turn your cup upside down on your saucer and place your spoon across it. And the correct phrase to accompany this gesture is, "Thank you. I shall take no tea." ALL: Thank you. I shall take no tea. Ladies. She's even more beautiful than you said. But she's so wild. I've looked into her eyes, Elizabeth. There's spirit under the wildness, not viciousness. I could tame her. (PENNY NICKERING) Felicity, no. I won't hurt you, Penny-girl. I promise I won't hurt you. (PENNY NEIGHING) (SNORTING) FELICITY: It's all right, girl. Felicity. FELICITY: It's okay. (NEIGHING) FELICITY: It's okay, I'll be back. (PENNY NEIGHS) Come, Elizabeth. Where are we going? Hurry. (PENNY SNORTING) (DOOR CLICKS) (CHAINS CLANKING) (GRUNTS) (PENNY NICKERS) Hello, Penny-girl. (PENNY NICKERS) I-It's your friend, Felicity. (PENNY GRUNTS) I won't hurt you, Penny-girl. That's a fine girl. (PENNY GRUNTS) I know you don't trust me, Penny-girl, but you will. You will. (PENNY CHOMPING) (DOOR OPENING) (SNORTING) JIGGY NYE: Who's out there? (PENNY NEIGHS) (FELICITY SHUSHING) Who's out there? FELICITY: Quiet down, Penny, he'll hear you. It's all right, girl. (NEIGHING) JIGGY NYE: You scoundrel, you. You can't run from me. I'll catch you. You scoundrel. (GRUNTING) (GASPS) (GRUNTING) Come here. Come back here, you villain. (MUTTERING) You little trespasser. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Grandfather, let me help you. (PANTS) The strangest thing happened early this morning, Felicity. I was sleeping, and I heard a noise from outside. You know what I saw? Look at this stubborn weed. Someone running up the front path. (GRUNTING) I've got it. Someone who looked an awful lot like you. Oh, Grandfather. She needs me so. I had to go back and see her. Who, my dear? Penny. Jiggy Nye's horse. You won't tell, will you? I've raised thoroughbreds for over 30 years, and I dare say you love horses even more than I do. But I don't want you mixed up with Nye. Understood? Grandfather, if you could just see her. I know, child. But remember, she belongs to someone else. Yes, sir. Good. Now, let's tend to those weeds. GRANDFATHER: It was an excellent meal, Martha. And where are you from, lad? Yorktown, sir. Ah. Grandfather has a beautiful plantation near Yorktown. We visit every summer. Did you hear about an incident there involving an English ship carrying tea? Aye. Last November. The young hotheads threw crates of tea into the river just like those rebels in Boston. It was a disgrace. They simply do not want the King's taxes, sir. Not at the cost of their own liberty. Nonsense. All this talk against the King is nothing but the ranting of irresponsible scoundrels. There are those who would disagree with you. I've decided to stop selling tea. What? The King's taxation of the colonies is unfair. It's unjust. Stop this talk. Gentlemen, please. The children. GRANDFATHER: I'll not have it. I will not listen to such talk in my own family. It is treason. Treason. Do you hear? I've never seen Grandfather so upset. They have different beliefs. Your father and Ben are Patriots. They believe that the colonies should be independent of the King. Grandfather is a Loyalist. He... He is loyal to the King. Like Elizabeth's parents? Yes, dear. But they've just arrived from England, you see. Now, you must try to get some sleep. Mother, what side should I be on? That is a question you must answer for yourself, my child. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Father. Grandfather. You're not angry any longer, Grandfather? My dear, words that are spoken in the heat of anger are never from the heart. I do not agree with your father, but I love him. Do you understand? I wish you didn't have to leave so soon. Well, it's not long before your visit to the plantation. We'll be together all summer. I love you, Grandfather. And I you, child. Sleep well, Miss Felicity. (ROOSTER CROWING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (ROOSTER CONTINUES CROWING) I'm here again, Penny. If Grandfather would see you, he'd understand why I had to come. Penny, he'd love you as much as I do. Penny. That's my pretty girl. Still haven't decided on your sampler, Felicity? No, ma'am. Not as of yet. (BELL DINGS) Thank you, young ladies. Please bring your dancing slippers next week. We shall begin instruction in the minuet. Where on earth would we dance the minuet in this place? While I'm certain you consider our colonies provincial, Miss Cole, the balls here are quite splendid. The Templeton Christmas Eve ball is a grand occasion where people dance the minuet flawlessly. Do hurry along, Bitsy. Oh, how I despise that name. It's hard to imagine that two sisters could be so very different. Bitsy, I'm leaving with or without you. I know. We should think of a name for her. Bananabelle. ANNABELLE: Bitsy. Coming. Bananabelle. (BOTH LAUGHING) Shoulder your firearms. Rest your firearms. Oh, Felicity, wouldn't it be wonderful to attend the Templeton Christmas Eve ball? We'd have to dance. We're going to learn. I'm not one for dancing. We could wear beautiful gowns. You make it sound so grand. It would be grand. And we could go together. Just think of it. BOY: Felicity. Here. Hello. Father says we're not to speak to the militia soldiers. Why not? Father says they're disloyal to the King and the King's armies. They don't like the King's tax. That's all. I think I should be going. Goodbye, Felicity. Goodbye, Elizabeth. (SOLDIERS CHANTING) Would you care for a biscuit, Lady Windsor? Yes. Lady Windsor. Your manners. (BABY CRYING) Felicity, will you put my mending basket in my bedchamber, please? Of course, Mother. (BABY CONTINUES CRYING) (NAN CONTINUES CHATTERING) (WHISPERS) Ben's breeches. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (PENNY SNUFFLES) (ROOSTER CROWING) Hello, Penny. (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) (FELICITY LAUGHING) Whoa! Ben. Felicity. What are you... It's not what you think. I wasn't thinking anything. Except I've found my missing Sunday breeches. Yes, I was thinking something. Why are you wearing my missing Sunday breeches? Come with me. (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (WHISPERING) What are we doing here? Penny. I've been visiting her every morning. Secretly. And I borrowed your good breeches so my petticoats wouldn't get muddy. You hardly ever wear them. And I... (PENNY NEIGHING) (WHISPERING) It's him. I told you to stay away from here. (PENNY NEIGHS) I'll teach you. Defy me, you worthless, hopeless nag, you. I'm telling you. I'll teach you. (PENNY NEIGHING) (GRUNTS) You run. You better run. (GROANING) You worthless nag. I'd give you to anyone who can ride you. Anyone can have you. (GROANS) (SIGHING) I hope you never come back. Stay away, for all I care. Did you just hear what he said? Let's go. Let's go before he sees us. I can ride Penny. I've tamed her. You've what? He said anyone can have her who can ride her. You can't always have everything you want, Felicity. We need to go, now. Ben, if I leave her here, Jiggy Nye will kill her. She's not yours to claim. (PANTING) I'm duty-bound to tell your father about this. Ben, no. Please. You mustn't tell. Please. (HORSE NEIGHING) (GIRLS CHATTERING) There you are, Bitsy. You know Father doesn't want us to patronize this shop. Is that true? Yes. Why wouldn't your father want you to shop here? Isn't it obvious? We're Loyalists. We'll not patronize a shop which sells no tea. Are you a Loyalist, Elizabeth? Of course she is. I was asking Elizabeth. Are you? Well, my family is. But what about you? Is that what you believe in? Yes. Just like you're a Patriot because your family are Patriots. We have both Loyalists and Patriots in my family. I haven't decided which I'll be yet. I just hope we can still be friends. We'll be friends always. No matter what. Bitsy. Coming. Bananabelle. (BOTH GIGGLING) Are you all finished, Felicity? FELICITY: Yes, ma'am. Well, we'll be on our way then. By the way, Ben, have you still not found your good breeches? My good breeches? MRS. MERRIMAN: Yes. They've been missing nearly a month now. It's not like you to be that careless, Ben. I know where they are. Well? I have lent them to a friend. Indeed? May I ask why? This friend needs them more than I, ma'am. MRS. MERRIMAN: How very charitable of you. Perhaps we can find you a new pair. Felicity, come along. Thank you, Ben. Yes, well... I have a surprise for you. MRS. MERRIMAN: Felicity. Tomorrow morning. Hmm. Mother, Father, come quickly. Whoa, Penny. Felicity Merriman. Where did you get that animal? It's Penny. Isn't she beautiful? That's Jiggy Nye's horse. What on earth are you doing with it? He said anyone who could ride her could have her. I'm riding her, so... He said this to you? Not exactly to me. But I heard him plain as day. I don't understand. You said that this, uh, was a wild horse. How did you tame it? I went every morning and waited for her to trust me. I was patient, Mother. You went every morning? I'm sorry, Mother, but I know if I had asked, you wouldn't have let me go. Felicity, you have to take this horse back to the tannery at once. And you have to apologize to Jiggy Nye. Father, he beats her. And he starves her. Nevertheless, she belongs to him. You can't just take other people's property whenever you feel like it. Then let's buy her. Oh, please, Father, let her stay, let her stay. Let's buy her. Felicity... JIGGY NYE: You. (PENNY NEIGHS) (PENNY SNUFFLING) Thief. Get down off my horse. You said you'd give her to anyone who could ride her. I never did, you lying girl. Yes, you did. I heard you. (PENNY NEIGHING) Mr. Nye, no one is trying to steal your horse. My daughter misunderstood. She was wrong to take your animal, but it was a child's honest mistake. Mistake? Taking a horse is a crime. The only crime committed here, sir, is your mistreatment of this poor beast. (PENNY NEIGHING) I'm willing to buy her from you. I'm not interested in doing business with you, Merriman. Now tell your brat to get off my horse before I rip her down myself. You hold your peace, sir. FELICITY: Penny, you're not going anywhere. It's okay. Penny doesn't belong to you, sweetheart. No! Father! You have to give it back to Mr. Nye. No. Father. No. Let her stay. please. Sweetheart. No! Felicity. Calm. Calm. You can take your horse FELICITY: No! (PENNY SNUFFLES) FELICITY: Penny! And get off my property. And don't you come sneaking around, girl. If I see you near this horse again, I swear, I'll kill it. I'll tan its hide before I let you touch her again. Penny. (PENNY NEIGHS) (SOBS) MR. MERRIMAN: Have you cried all your tears, my dear sweet girl? (SOBS) Mmm-hmm. (SNIFFLES) (CRYING) (MOANS) It was all a waste. Wasn't it, Father? To do a good thing echoes in the world, and will come back to you. Penny will never come back to me, Father. She'll be forced to live in that horrible place until she dies or is beaten to death. It's so unfair. Aye. She'd be better off loose again. (HORSE NEIGHING) Running free in the woods. You did everything you could to help her, child. Not everything. (PENNY NICKERS) Hello. (WHISPERING) Come on now. Come on, my independent Penny. Let's fly. (PENNY NEIGHS) Here we go, girl. Come on, girl. You can do it. Faster. Over the fence, Penny. Over the fence. (GRUNTS) (CRYING) Go on. Why are you still standing there? Go. Go, you're free. Go. Goodbye. Goodbye, my beautiful Penny. (HORSE NEIGHING) If I'm to escort you, we must make haste. The soldiers are marching on the green. I wanna watch a while. I wish I could watch with you. I wish I could be out there with them. Someday you might be. It's started. The fight for independence. The Patriots are gathering at Yorktown now. Soon all the men will be leaving for war. Let's pray it doesn't come to war. The world is changing, Felicity. You must pay attention. There's more to life than tea lessons. I know that. Yet you're still drinking tea. It would be impolite to refuse. Tea is a sign of your hostess' hospitality. Tea is a sign of tyranny. Come on now, off to your tea lessons. **(PIANO PLAYING) MISS MANDERLY: Proper deportment, please. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Attention to your carriage. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. MISS MANDERLY: One, step, two, three, four, five, six. One, step, two, three, four, now, reverse. One, step, two, three, four, and... Would you care for tea, Miss Manderly? Yes, thank you, Miss Cole. Milk and sugar, Miss Manderly? Milk. Thank you, Miss Cole. Would you care for tea, Miss Cole? Yes, please, Miss Cole. Milk and sugar, Miss Cole? Milk, please. Thank you, Miss Cole. Would you care for some tea, Miss Merriman? Miss Merriman? Yes? Would you care for some tea? Thank you, Miss Cole. I shall take no tea. I suppose you're a Patriot now? I suppose I am. Annabelle says we shouldn't socialize with Patriots. But that's just because no one wants to socialize with Annabelle. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Oh, I'm going to miss you this summer. And I you. I wish you could come to Grandfather's plantation and visit. We need to stay in Williamsburg. Will you write to me? Every day. Miss Felicity. FELICITY: Marcus. What is it? It's about Master Ben. He's gone missing now most of the afternoon. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Felicity, come away from there. She's waiting for Ben. Maybe he's hurt. Maybe he needs our help. Or perhaps he went to meet a friend. Perhaps, Felicity. Perhaps. He's not coming back. He is coming back. He is. Ben is not a runaway, is he, Mother? I can't say, dear. I really can't. Marcus, you know Ben. He wouldn't run off without a word, would he? Well, he's never missed a day of work since I've known him. It's out of our hands now. MRS. MERRIMAN: Here you go, Nan. Come, Felicity. Oh, Felicity. Good to see you. Oh. Must I wear the hat? It's part of the new riding habit Grandfather gave to you. I think it's quite elegant. Come, let me see what you look like. Oh, Felicity, how beautiful. And look. A sidesaddle. (ALL CHUCKLING) Where are we going, Grandfather? Well, I could use your assistance on a morning errand. Are you sure you're up to all this, Father? MRS. MERRIMAN: Perhaps you'd rather rest in the shade for a bit. You worry too much, Martha. And with a child on the way, you should take a bit of your own advice. (MRS. MERRIMAN LAUGHING) (HORSE NICKERING) GRANDFATHER: These animals appear to be in fine condition. I do believe some of them are handsome enough to pull my riding chair. You're a good judge of horses, child. (HORSE NEIGHING) What do you think? They seem so... (GASPS) Oh, that can't be. Penny. Penny, is that you? (HORSE NICKERING) (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHING) Penny. It is you. It is. Oh, Penny. Penny. I prayed so hard we'd see each other again someday. (LAUGHING) Grandfather. You found her. You would not believe how many copper-colored mares there are in Virginia. But I was fairly certain this was the one. What if Jiggy Nye wants her back? Oh, I'll settle matters with Nye. Oh, Grandfather, I will never forget this for the rest of my life. I don't even know how to thank you. You've done an old man's heart good. Oh, may I ride her? To your soul's content, my child. (BOTH LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) (FELICITY GIGGLING) (LAUGHING) GRANDFATHER: Oh, Felicity. (LAUGHING) I'm not hungry, my dear. Thank you. It's from your father. Is he coming? Is he? He'll be joining us at week's end. It will be so good to see him. Will he stay long, Mother? I'm afraid, with Ben still missing, he won't be able to leave the store but a few days. I always had doubts about that lad. He's included a notice from the paper, Father. "Runaway apprentice. "A lad named Benjamin Davidson. Medium build, brown hair, able-bodied, 15 years old." GRANDFATHER: Really? Let me see. Darling, hand that to your grandfather. "I hereby forewarn all persons not to harbor him. "Reward." That will get the bounty hunters' attention. Perhaps, if he did run away, he had a good reason. Felicity, there's never a good reason for breaking a contract. I hate Ben. MRS. MERRIMAN: Nan. Well, I do. He ruined everything. We don't know what happened to him. And I don't think we should judge him without knowing. Isn't that right, Mother? Aye, Felicity. We should dwell on what we do know. Your father is coming at week's end, and it will be wonderful to have him. Oh, Father. He says that the Royal Governor and his family have been forced to leave Williamsburg. Things have turned for the worse quickly. I worry where it will all lead. You should worry less and rest more. If you'll excuse me... Why is Grandfather so tired? I'm afraid he hasn't quite recovered from the fever last winter. We must all try to help him get stronger. (DOG BARKING) BOUNTY HUNTER 1: A lad was sighted last night near the Reynolds' plantation by the creek. BOUNTY HUNTER 2: We think it's your runaway, sir. Are you still offering that reward? We have our dogs at the ready. They can find him. GRANDFATHER: My son-in-law will be here shortly. If you capture the lad, he'll make good on the reward. BOUNTY HUNTER 1: Do we have permission to search your land, sir? Search away. Thank you, sir. Thank you. (DOGS BARKING) We should head north first. BOUNTY HUNTER 2: All right. BOUNTY HUNTER 1: He must have come in... Ben's signal whistle? (HORSE NICKERING) (NEIGHS) (WHISTLE BLOWING) Ben? (WHISTLE BLOWING) (PENNY NEIGHING) Ben! (WHISTLES) Ben. Felicity. You're hurt. (NEIGHING) Let me tend to that. Be careful. It's true, then? You ran away? I didn't plan on running. (GRUNTS) Stay still. How foolish I was to believe in you. You had a contract with my father, Ben. You gave your word. I have to do more for my country than serve out a contract. I have to be part of the battle for our freedom. Aren't you the one who told me that you can't always have everything you want? This is different. Not to me, it isn't. I know you're angry with me, Felicity, but... (SIGHS) It's nice to see you. Don't you try and make me forget how mad I am at you, Benjamin Davidson. There. That should hold until we get you to Grandfather's. Come on. I can't go. General Washington is going to lead an army of Patriots. I'm going to be one of them. There are bounty hunters out there looking for you. Do you hear? You need to turn yourself in. I won't waste three more years of my life being an apprentice. Grandfather says, "'Tis never a good thing to run toward something "if you're running away from something else." Look at that. You can't even bear your own weight. Yes, I can. It's fine. BOUNTY HUNTER: Dogs picked up a scent. (HORSE NEIGHING) (DOGS BARKING) Looky. He's gone into that. Did you just hear that? Ben. Bounty hunters. I'll go hide in the woods. You go on now. Go. No. Ben, can't you see how dangerous and foolish this is? Come with me. Please. (BOUNTY HUNTERS CHATTERING) (HORSE NEIGHING) (DOGS BARKING) They're getting close. Let's go. Please. All right, then. I'll stay in the stable until nightfall. When will you leave? After midnight. I'll not see you again, Felicity Merriman. I thank you. Did you ever think of talking to my father? Asking for permission? You know as well as I that he would have held me to my promise. Shouldn't you hold yourself to the promises you make, Ben? Isn't that what making promises is all about? (HORSE NEIGHING) GRANDFATHER: All right. Proceed to the second paragraph. MR. MERRIMAN: Of course, we must be certain that everything is attended to properly. Excuse me, sir, there's a gentleman here who'd... Ben. Ben, you're safe. What's the meaning of this? Ben, where have you been? He's been hiding in the woods, Father. Felicity convinced me to come back. I apologize, sir. It was wrong of me to run away, break a promise I made to the both of us. I meant no disrespect to you. You've always treated me well and fairly. But there's things that I believe in with all my heart and soul and I wanted to become a soldier, so that I could fight for them. Ridiculous. This lad should be in prison. I will not allow you to break your apprenticeship agreement with me, Ben. You are pledged to me for three more years. Aye, sir. But within that time, you will turn 16. When that occurs, if you still wish to become a soldier, I will allow it. Thank you, sir. Thank you, I'm most grateful. But you and I must have an understanding, young Ben, that you will return and you will finish out your service to me once your soldiering days are through. Is that understood? Yes, sir. It seems more than fair. Now, I suggest you put on some clean clothes so you can return down here and join us for supper. Thank you, sir. Thank you. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Tell me, child, how did you convince that obstinate lad to come home? (CHUCKLES) I didn't, Grandfather. You did. I told him, "'Tis never a good thing to run toward something..." If you're running away from something else. (LAUGHING) Oh. You've learned well, my... (GASPING) Grandfather? (CHOKING) Mother. Mother. (GASPING) FELICITY: My dearest friend Elizabeth, it is with heavy heart that I write these words. My grandfather has died. It is as if summer has ended forever with his passing. I did not have the chance to say a last goodbye, to kiss his cheeks, to thank him
