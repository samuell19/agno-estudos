Hey. You didn't wake me. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want some coffee? Mm-hmm. That's no good. Something you ate? Yeah, maybe it was your cooking. - Yeah? - Yeah. Probably. Shut up. Go on, sit down. What's all this? It's just some work. I have to go. No, no, you're not getting out of here that easily. Okay, we're going, just tell her, get it over with. She's gonna to hate me. No. You'll be fine. I should eat. Hey he hey, what are you doing? We're going for lunch. But your brother doesn't have lunch till about five p.m.. He's not my brother. Oh, "he's not my brother." We're not even related. Yeah, still. Fill up while we can. Still worrying? Hmm? It's gonna be okay. My brother made me a quiche. Well, that's all vegetarians eat anyways, love. Yeah, every week. - Just quiche. - Only quiche. Well, go on, then. Play something. I need to pee. It's not ready. We don't have lunch till three on Sundays. Yeah, I remember. If you're hungry, I can make you something. No, no, I'm fine. Hi. Sorry. Hello. How are you? Good, good. How are you? I made you a quiche. Thank you. Delicious. Hey babe. - Everything all right? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. She's waiting. Have you seen the state of the grass? You know, I'm just glad your father isn't here to see what I've been reduced to. You got Thomas. Oh yes, I have, but he can't do everything. Grab us more lip. Any more for anymore? Charlotte passed her driving test on Friday, didn't you? Oh, good. Well, that's useful. Thank you. Mum. We've decided that we're moving. Well, that is good. You know, I think the Hendersons' place is becoming available. No, no. We're moving to Australia. Excuse me? Australia. We've been thinking about it for a while and it's... Kind of... Just makes sense. What about your responsibilities? What responsibilities, Mum? This house. Your family. Nine generations. Here we are. Your brother is leaving me. He's not my brother, and I'm not leaving you, Mum. We're moving to Australia. Well, I don't feel really well, you know. - Where are you going? - I'm going to go lie down. - It's my hip. - Hip. - Will you bring my food up? - Mum. Yes, and I'll bring your hot water bottle, don't worry. No, we will discuss it, just the two of us. My glasses. Thank you. Lunch is almost ready. We're not staying. When you're finished clocking out, can you give me a hand moving Stanley? Door's loose on his stable. Oh, man, you know I have to start riding lessons? Open this place up to schools or something. But you hate kids. Aye, I do hate kids. You all right? Yeah, I just feel a bit dizzy today. Okay. Well, do you want to sit down? Whoa, are you all right? I am so sorry. Don't be sorry, it's fine. I think we should take you to the medical center. - No, I don't like doctors. - I'm not asking, we're going. Charlotte Wilde? Dr. Richards is ready for you. This has been going on for how long? A week or two, maybe three. You live with Ben Clayton up by Horn Lane? Yeah, a year and a half. Not married. Nope. Your last period, how long ago was it? I'm not sure, it can be irregular. - More than six weeks? - Maybe. I mean, I don't remember. Well, we should, please, sit down. We should do a blood test to be sure, but I'm quite certain you're pregnant. Congratulations. But I can't be because I'm on the pill. No form of birth control is 100% effective. I need to get you booked in with a stenographer, they come to the hospital every Thursday. Don't seem to have any of your medical records. Any family history I should know about, preexisting conditions? What if I don't want it? The baby, what if I don't want to go through with it? What are you suggesting? It's a shock, I just want to know what my options are. I think your best option would be to go home, discuss this with Ben, and not make any rash decisions. Thanks. Hey hey hey, I'll get that. I'll get that, you shouldn't be lifting. Oh my god. How the hell do you know? - Doesn't matter. - Ben. Mum told me. - What?! - Dr. Richards told Mum. He's been our doctor for ages. You are, you are, aren't you? I could have him struck off for that. Come on, I know it's not news you wanted, but it is such good news! - No, is it? - Yes! We're meant to be going away. How are we gonna do that? We'll go as a family. You, me, and the baby. No, no no no, no, I'm on the pill for a reason? You're not your mum. Fuck off. And that's what you're worried about. You're not your mum, you're gonna be a great mum. You're gonna be a great mum, all right? Promise you. And I'm gonna be an amazing dad, obviously. You don't get it. Go away, leave me alone, leave me alone. I'll put these in water. Congratulations are in order. This is very exciting. Thank you. So we're going to have to act quickly before she starts to show, prepare everything. - Prepare what? - For the wedding. Oh, Mum. I thought we'd have a marquis. We don't need one. But we can't have that many people in the house. - No, we don't need a wedding. - Of course you do. No we don't. What will people say? Well, they can say what they like. We're not gonna be here long. You're not still planning that nonsense. You're not taking my grandchild. I'm sorry, Mum. We have to do what's right for us. You're not stealing my own flesh and blood to the other side of the planet. We need a fresh start. It's easy for you, you have no one. Coming back here, Mum, it was only ever temporary. I can't stay here. - You don't mean that. - I do mean it. I do mean it, and stop telling me what I want! You cannot walk out on this place! I've got to go work. It's not gonna be that bad, Mum, okay? We'll fly you out to Australia, we can fly back, we can come for Christmas. Please. We can Skype. Look, I'll call you later, okay? We can talk about it. Mum. Look, I know that was hard for you. I'm proud of you. Yeah? You did it. We are going to Australia. We're going to Australia. We're going to Australia. We're going to Australia. Jesus fucking Christ. What is it? Congratulations. Thank you. See, he's okay. No he's not. Whoa, dude! Shh, don't say anything. Oh, god. Okay. Do you want to talk about it? I don't want it. I don't want the baby. I mean this whole something using my body as a host and then getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then coming out of a hole that is that big. It's , to be fair. Oh, I don't want to be a mum. I don't want to be stuck being a mum, and I don't even know what being a mum looks like. Exhausted. You already live like that, so it's fine. Shut up, I'm serious. Look, you'd be great. And I mean, at least you'll be making Margaret happy. Oh, fucking Margaret. And Thomas. I mean, why is he even there? I don't know. They're not even related. He just... Ben reckons he's trying to worm his way into the will. Ah, probably wants the house. Yeah, he can have it. This is shit. You're getting rid of it? Ooh. - Oh. - Speak of the devil. Sorry. What time do you call this, then? It's been a mad day. Why people think pigs are pets. - How you doing? - Hi baby. What we got? Bonnie. Hey. Hey. Hey, you. Is there anything I should know? She's just not been herself, to be honest. You know, she's normally so lively. Anyway, I'll be back with your tea in a sec. - See what you think. - All right, cheers. Bonnie. You all right? All right? Ben? Charlotte! Jane? Charlotte, someone help! - What happened? - Charlotte. She's kicked him. Ben, Ben, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Ben, can you hear me? Ben. Ben, you're gonna be all right. It's Jane. Ben, it's gonna be okay, we're gonna get you, Charlotte, come help me lift him. I think we should all someone. Charlotte. No, there's no time for that, will you grab his legs? We need to get him outside. Ben. You're gonna be all right. It's Jane. You're gonna be okay. Let's lift. We're taking you there now. Grab that, put pressure on the wound, okay? Okay. Just keep talking to him, okay? - Stay with me, please. - It's gonna be all right. Stay with me, okay? Going to be all right, just stay with me. It's gonna be okay, Char, all right? Charlotte. I'm sorry. We did everything we could. The damage was just too great. What have you done? - I'm sorry? - Not you, her. This is all your fault. Charlotte! Get her off me! - My son. - My god. It's my son. Oh, my son. My son, my son. Hey. How you feeling? Here, have some of this. Been in bed for the past few days, you must be exhausted. You remember what happened? The funeral's tomorrow. Okay, well I need to see him. No you don't. I wish I hadn't. There are some things in life it's better not to see. I think we've all behaved in ways that we regret. How are you feeling? How is the baby? I should go home. No, rest. It's the doctor's orders. Need to start thinking about the baby. Just stay here with us for a while. We'll look after you, we have everything you need. It's a bit cold in here. Thomas, get her a heater, I don't want her to get sick. Just try and get some rest, and we will serve lunch at one. Where did you get that? In Ben's room. Would you take it off, please? - I was cold, I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'll get you something else. Come in, my dear, how are you? Come and have something to eat. Sorry, I was very hungry. - Here you are. - Thanks. Well, I think it's important that we all keep our strength up. Oh, goodness, Thomas. Oh. I'm so sorry, my dear, so sorry. Honestly, no, it's fine. I'm not even that hungry. - Oh. - Excuse the fingers. It's fine. Have a little bit of salt and pepper. I think we need to find something suitable for you to wear at the funeral. Where is it? It's going to be here. On the grounds, we're going to... Lay Ben to rest just takes to his father. I think that's what he would have wanted. I'm gonna need to go home. I need some of my things. Well, I sent Thomas over yesterday. He collected some of your things. I think everything you want would be in your wardrobe. Do you know where my phone is? Yes. Thanks. It must've broken when you fell. But I can get it fixed for you when I'm next in town. Yeah. Yeah, do you mind, is that all right? - Of course. - Thank you, appreciate it. Gee, I thought there'd be more people. It's so remote here, and Margaret said she wanted a small family thing. What about what you wanted? It doesn't matter. You okay? No, I've been feeling dizzy. Well, it's understandable. Hello, Jane. I'm so sorry. How are you feeling? Would you like to have a rest? I'm fine. There's going to be some refreshments headed around shortly, so make sure you eat something. I swear, this grass. It's a disgrace. - Should we head in? - Hmm. Listen, I can't stay, I've got to get back to work. - But will you be all right? - Yeah. Sure? Can play something else, if you prefer. No. Don't really get a chance to play that often. I'm trying to convince Margaret to learn a song with me. She's got such an amazing voice. But she won't. It's a waste. You play, don't you? I used to. Oh, whoop. - Sorry. - Okay? Yeah, fine, I just get a bit dizzy. - Sorry. - Okay. Sit down. Ooh. I'll get you some water. No, I'm fine, I'm okay, honestly. It's not fair. Sorry, I don't mean to disturb you. Oh, been too much death in this family. Poor Ben. His father William, he died of cancer. And I miss him every single day. He was the most wonderful father, and Ben just adored him. And Thomas's dad? That was a farming accident. I just should never married him, that was the biggest mistake of my life. Come. Oh. I think it's gonna be a boy. I really hope so. Some women flourish when they're pregnant, it certainly seems to suit you. It won't be long now before you start feeling some movement. I'm looking for my shoes. I was thinking of taking walk to the grave. Thomas said that you were dizzy last night. Yeah, but I think some fresh air might do me some good, no? Yes, well maybe later, but it's a bit cold now, you've got to think about the baby. It's all I think about. You just follow what Dr. Richards' orders are and that baby will be just fine, and that means you resting and not rushing out into the freezing cold. I think I'm ready to go home now. Oh, well look, we have your things here. Come, I'll show you. You know, he was never very good with money. Just like his father, would seem that Ben had more than a few financial problems. When the bank found out he was dead, they foreclosed on the cottage. What? I'm sorry, I don't understand. I know you may have some reservations, but you can stay here. I think is the best place for you. But he didn't mention anything. - My house. - Ben's house. You just have a rest and we can worry about the future later. I'm sorry, I had to go through everything. I had to get the paperwork for the inheritance tax. If there's anything belonging to you, I'll make sure that Thomas brings it up to you or puts it in the basement, isn't that right, Thomas? Yeah. So you're telling me that I no longer have a home. I know. Bit of a shock. But maybe for the best. Being part of the family. Sorry, is everybody okay with quiche? Hey. What happened to my hand? You cut it on a glass last night. Do you not remember? Maybe you should just stay in bed. You've got a visitor downstairs, but I'll just send her away. What? Jane? Yeah. No, no, no, I'm coming. It's good to see you. So how you feeling? Stuck. - Still? - Hmm. Well, I know that I don't want to be here. Australia? Yeah, somehow. How is the yard? Oh, it's all good, you know, same old. We miss you. So has everything been okay with your scans and stuff? I've not had any yet. The doctor comes here, he said I don't need to. What? Can I get you some tea? I'm okay, thank you. Maybe you should see another doctor. - Well, yeah- - Oh, don't worry. Dr. Richards has everything under control. Does she not need to go to hospital? He doesn't seem to think it's necessary. We can take care of her here. Right. You okay? Yeah. Sorry. God, I just felt, I'm just gonna go to the toilet. Give me a minute. Do you want me to come with you? No no no, sit down, I'll be back. Be back in a sec. Thomas. Where's Jane? She had to go, something at work. She said she'd call you. What, she just left, just like that? Hmm. Okay, so have you fixed my phone? Should be ready Friday. I'm gonna start making lunch. Oh my god. Jeez. Thomas, what are you doing? What? Why are you in here? You were screaming the night, so I came in. You wouldn't let me leave, do you not remember? No. Well, can you get out, please? Okay, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I've ordered everything for the nursery so we can start painting soon. - Nursery? - Yeah, for the baby. We won't be living here, Thomas. No, I know, I know, it's for when you visit. Hopefully. Okay. Sorry. Hello Mr. Magpie, how's your wife? It is bad luck to see only one. Thomas tells me you were feeling a bit sick yesterday. Bit nauseous? Hmm. I was the same as Benjamin. Just terrible. You have a drink of this. Thanks. Now, I'm just gonna leave you to have a rest. Margaret! Margaret! Get your scrawny ass down here and give me my money now! Just calm down, George. I was situation, I wasn't sure that you could manage it on your own. I was managing. I don't understand why you insist on. How the hell would he get here all the way to the house? I don't know, he must've just cut the chain or something. I was terrified. Right, well, he's gone now, he's all gone. Anything could have happened. Look, look, I'll go down to the gate and I will make sure it's locked. But just calm down. Okay? I want to go to the hospital today. Now, I want a scan. They have someone there on Thursdays. Well you can't, I have an appointment elsewhere. Well, I'm going, with or without your help. Don't be ridiculous, how are you gonna get there? I'll walk if I have to. Okay. Okay! Thomas will take you. - Charlotte Wilde. - Yep, that's me. No no, I can go alone. - Is this dad? - No, no, he's- - A friend. - Okay, follow me. Okay. So you're 20 weeks, but this is your first scan? Yup. Okay. So... There we are. Can you see it? Oh my god. Bear with me, I'm just gonna take a few measurements. I'm just looking at the blood flowing in and out of the heart. It all looks okay? Yes, so far everything looks fine. Do you want to know the sex? It's a boy. That's right. So are you planning on having the baby here? There's a few great birthing rooms upstairs. I dunno. I haven't thought about it. Yeah, I guess so. I can organize for you to come in and take a look. You okay? I've been feeling dizzy. Well, that's normal. I've been having these weird dreams as well. When I was pregnant, I kept dreaming about clowns. It was terrible. What are yours? Birds, crows and stuff. It's better than clowns. So it's normal. Completely. It's hormones. See, there you go. Is there anything else on your mind? I'm feeling a little thirsty. Thomas, can you go get me some water? Oh, there's a water fountain at the end of the hall. - Thanks. - Yeah, yeah, of course. Can I still fly? Fly? I was thinking about going away. I mean, yeah, I don't see why not. Usually up to seven months, although I'm not sure I'd advise it. You off on holiday? I'm not sure. Is everything okay? Do you want to talk to somebody? Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but they won't let me go anywhere. Who? The family that I'm staying with. I think they broke my phone. And they put something in my tea. What do you mean by something? Some kind of tablet. I'm confused all the time, not just dizzy. I think they're giving me something. Look, I think I'm gonna need your help. Okay, wait here. Thank you. Where's she gone? She said she needed to get someone. Who? Dunno. - What is he doing here? - He's your doctor. No, no, no, he's not my doctor. Listen to me, listen to me. What you're experiencing. Paranoia, anger, resentment, and during pregnancy, your hormones are all... No no, I'm not paranoid. They won't let me out the house. He took my phone. Maybe they're a tad overzealous, but it's your health and the health of the baby they have in mind. Baby's the most important thing, no? I'm sure we can all agree on that. Charlotte? Yeah, I'm trying- - If you keep this frenzy up, I mean it, you will lose the baby. Ben's baby, I'm not exaggerating. For the baby's sake, for your sake, try to stay calm. Do you understand? Go home, go to bed, read a book. Relax. Okay? Thank you, Dr. Richards. Look, I don't know what you think is going on. All we want is to keep you safe, keep the baby safe. Really? - Yes. - You sure about that? Yes. That baby is everything to Margaret, and to me too. Why do you keep me shut in the house? We don't keep you trapped in there. Dr. Richards said total bedrest, okay? So all we're doing is what he told us to do. Charlotte, you are pregnant, it's safety first. I can't wait to leave this place. I know you broke my phone. - I didn't break your phone. - I know you did. I told you they can't fix it, it's dead. Did you put something in my tea? Do you really think we would do something like that? I can't believe you think we would do that. That's crazy. Look, we can give you somewhere safe to stay until the baby's born. After that, if you want to leave, no one's gonna stop you. But let us look after you. If not for you, for Ben, for the baby. - You condition, Charlotte- - I don't have a condition. That was my mum's thing. Yeah, my mum had a condition, this is not that. Okay? Where else are you going to go, Charlotte? Hello. Hey. Can I come in? Yeah, sure. I've just brought you a... Come sit down. Have you thought about names? Oh, not really. Maybe Benjamin? You're doing so well, I think he'd be so proud. I just feel so big and fat and tired. Yes, I know it's hard. You have to enjoy it. I didn't. The feeling of something growing inside me. The aches and pains. For the last two months, I was confined to bedrest. High blood pressure. It was this room, I sat in that bed. Looking outside, watching the birds and the trees and just waiting for it to end. I was never very broody. It was William who wanted the child. And even when he was born, it wasn't like people say, I didn't feel some overwhelming rush of love. I just felt numb. Indifferent. This strange, vulnerable thing sucking from me. Longing him for the day that he'd stopped crying and would just sleep through the night. You know he loved animals. He was always chasing after them, whether they liked it or not. And one day when he was about three or four, I think it must've been four. I don't know what age. But he was bitten by our dog, Fraser. Was terrible. Blood. So we rushed him to the car, screaming, and William driving like a mad man to the doctor's, and I was in the back with him. And suddenly I had this awful feeling. It was a feeling of worry and sickness. Simply blind panic. It was then I realized that I did love him. I loved him more than I thought was possible, I loved him so much. My whole body ached. It wasn't a nice feeling, but it was beautiful. And from that day on, I dedicated myself to him. But I'd missed out on those early years. I really envy you. I'd love to do it all again, and really enjoy it. To not wish it away. To love every bad night's sleep. Just to do it properly. To love having a baby in this house. What happened to the dog? Fraser? We had George shoot it. Ben was devastated, but we couldn't keep it. We got rabbits instead. Right, you have to use your imagination, okay? But I thought this would be the perfect choice for the nursery. Look, look. Paint's arrived. Mint mocha is apparently the most soothing color for newborns. Right? But I can do a little bit, and if you don't like it, we can choose something else. Now, I thought the cot would be perfect here, and that means we can plug the baby monitor into the socket down there, and it keeps it away from the radiator, because that can get so hot. No one knows how to turn it off. Oh, that's just a bunch of stuff Margaret asked me to bring up from the cellar. I think it's things that belonged to Ben when he was a kid. Charlotte. Are we all right? I know you miss Ben. I know, and I can't imagine how hard that's been for you. And I'm not trying to do anything weird, like replace him or anything like that. But I am here for you. And the baby. I'm here for you. I'm just gonna go to the loo. Okay. Oh. Margaret, the doors are all locked. I want to go for a walk. I'm afraid not. What do you mean? You can't lock me inside. The baby is due any time now. It's time for you to stay in bed. So I can't even leave the house now? You're not well. You don't even seem to realize that. It's terribly sad. No, no, Margaret. Margaret, I'm not ill. Your mother, she was ill too, wasn't she? You don't know anything about my mother. Did she scream at her sleep too? - Give me the key. - No. - Give me the key! - No! I'm leaving. - You have nowhere to go. - Oh really? Really?! You can spare me the histrionics. - Crazy bitch. - Why don't you just go up to your room and get into bed and wait for Thomas to prepare your food? Am I a prisoner now? It's to keep you safe. Don't tell me it's to keep me safe. Where's Margaret? She's gone to the solicitor again. I don't know why. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I've been thinking about what you were saying in the nursery and I am sorry if you think that I am being ungrateful. I don't think you're being ungrateful. I just want to say thank you for being someone in here that I can call a friend. Yes. Someone who gets it. Someone to look after me. I'm just glad you finally see that. I think I'm gonna head up to bed. Okay. Charlotte. I was gonna make dinner. Oh, I'm quite tired. Okay, okay. Thanks though. Good night. Good night. Charlotte! Oh god. Charlotte, wait! No no no! No no no! No no! Stop! Charlotte! Shit. Charlotte! Wait, Charlotte, stop! Stop, don't! Stop! Charlotte, don't! Charlotte, stop! No. No no no, the baby. Please, Charlotte, the baby. Charlotte, stop. You're not well, Charlotte. Charlotte! Charlotte! Hello? Please, you have to come and get me, they're coming. Where are you? I don't- I'll meet you by the fields where I gave you - riding lessons. - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah, okay, I'll Be there. - All right. - Stay calm. Okay, thanks a bunch. I'm coming now, okay? Charlotte. You're all right. - It's gonna be okay. - Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Thomas? Thomas. Thomas! Yes, Margaret? Can you bring my supper upstairs to my bedroom? - Now? - Yes, now. There's a good boy. Margaret? Margaret, I can hear you, open the door. Charlotte? Look, you had me worried. I thought you might lose the baby. Margaret, you have to open the door. Can't have you running around like a mad woman. I know this is hard work, but at least here I can keep an eye on you. You're sick. Don't you realize you're the one who's sick! I don't enjoy this. Maybe some time on your own will do you good. Thomas? You need to help me, please. I'm not supposed to talk to you. I don't feel well. There's something wrong with me. My head. Hopefully once the baby's out you're gonna feel better. What if I don't? You will. No, don't go! I'm sorry for running away, Thomas. I was just scared. I don't like seeing you like this, Charlotte. You have to start helping yourself. She's out all afternoon. I'm making us lunch. Can I go for a bath? Yes, of course you can. I'll bring up some towels. Lunch is ready. Why do you stick around? It's my home. Family's important. Do you really feel at home here? Of course I do. She doesn't treat you like you're family. That's not true. She uses you. We've been through a lot together. With your dad. Your mum, what was she like? She was a piano teacher. But she was sick. She had this thing called perinatal psychosis, and severe postpartum depression. Basically, she just couldn't cope with being a mum. So blamed me. Never really... Your turn. Tell me something about your father, then. He was a drunk. And? He was a horrible drunk. And he used to beat me. But then when we moved here, he beat Margaret instead. She sort of... She managed to absorb it. She was a lot braver than me. But... One night, he beat her so badly that she shattered her hip. God. You could hear her. When she was in hospital, he just sat around the house, drinking and shouting, all day, until eventually, I found him passed out upstairs on the landing. Just lying there. Completely useless. And I don't know why, but... I suddenly knew exactly what to do. And I'm glad I did it. What did you do? I knew they were threshing the top field, so I picked him up and dragged him up there, into the middle of the field, right into the middle, and I left him. And I knew the combines wouldn't see him in the morning. Did Ben know about any of this? Ben? Ben wouldn't have done anything. I did, I did it. Me. Don't worry, it's not murder. It's not. She needed me. And I'd do the same for you, if you needed me to. I understand. Please don't make me force you. Something else I need to tell you. She's been selling the cottage. What? The bank never foreclosed. And I told her to tell you, but she said not to. So I can move back in? No, no no no, it's gone. She can't do that. That was my house, Thomas. I know, but that's the thing. This can be your house now, here, with us. You're gonna get better, and then, and maybe then you and me, we can... Maybe we can... Look, this room, it's all gonna be over soon. Just do as you're told. Thomas. - I have to go. - Where are you going? Wait, where are you going? Why, Thomas, wait, no, please. Wait! Wait! Thomas, please don't leave me! Just talk to me, don't leave me alone! Don't leave me alone. I really, really like you, and maybe more than I should, and I think we have a connection, you know, something special, and maybe you're right, maybe me and you, maybe we could leave, maybe we could just go. Together, me and you, we can raise the baby, Thomas. Please, me and you, we can do it, but we have to go. We both have to get out, Thomas, please, I need you to get out of this house. You really are a twisted piece of work, aren't you? You sold my house! No, I sold Ben's house. I did it for us. And making Thomas kill his own father? Who was that for? Thomas and Ben had more allegiance to this family than you will ever know. Ben hated you! He was desperate to get away from here and away from you! Please don't speak about my beautiful, dead son! You should have had the things we said about you, Margaret. How he would laugh and laugh about you. You keep your poison away from Thomas, and from now on, you will deal only with me. Do you understand that? You don't even care about him. You only care about yourself. I care about this family. Which is more than can be said about you. Yeah, when I give birth, I'm gonna tell everybody what you've done, everyone in that hospital. We're not taking you to the hospital. The birth is going to happen here. Dr. Richards will oversee it. But Margaret, you can't do that, that's crazy. Well, I had my baby in this house, my dear, and so can you. Dr. Richards is more than capable. I'm sorry, Margaret! Come closer, I need to tell you something. Excuse me? Come closer. What is it? Closer. I have no interest in anything you want to say to me. No. Thomas! Thomas! Help! Is it coming? Is it coming? We need to go to the hospital right now. - Right now. - Okay. - I'll get Margaret. - No no no, there's no time. We need to go now. Thomas? Margaret, I think we have to go to the hospital. The baby's in trouble. I'll go and telephone Dr. Richards. Just not until I call the doctor. No, Margaret, I think we have to go now, the baby's in trouble. Look here, you stupid boy, don't you realize what she's up to? She's bleeding, I'm taking her. She needs me. You are not taking her! Stop it, Margaret! I'm taking her, come on, go. Margaret, stop it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Margaret, I'm sorry. I don't understand what's happening, is it coming? No, it can't be, it's too early! Is it still moving, is the baby still moving? I don't know, it just hurts, it just hurts, oh god. Look Charlotte, whatever they say, you gotta know that I had no idea it would do this, okay? What are you talking about, Thomas? It was just some stuff to help keep you calm, stuff to help you sleep better. Well, what did you give me? But then you just kept trying to run away. I don't know why you wanted to leave so much. We're family, you and me, we can be a family. No no, what did you give me, Thomas? What did you give me? Look, I'm sorry, it was stupid. It was stupid, it was stupid, I'll tell Dr. Richards everything, I promise, he'll know what to do. No, we have to go to the hospital! You can't take me there, Thomas! Let's go. I can't move. I can't move, you have to get him. You have to get him, get him, get him, get him now! Okay. Dr. Richards? He's with a patient. How can I help you, sir? - Sir? - Dr. Richards? Need help outside in the car, please. Okay. Charlotte? Thomas! No, no, no, no, no. Charlotte, Charlotte, what are you doing? Thomas, help! Charlotte. No no no no. Charlotte! Charlotte, no no no no! Charlotte! Charlotte! Yes! Oh my god! Thanks. - Hi. - Hi Charlotte. Hey, where's the where's the baby? - Is he okay? - The baby's fine. He's in the postnatal ward. I'm Dr. Rios. I'm one of the consultants here. Charlotte, do you remember how you got here? There was a crash. That's right. You were very lucky. All the swelling has gone down. You have no internal injuries, no broken bones. Just bruising. So when can I see the baby? Because I haven't seen him. Soon. But because of your medical records and the crash, social services have advised that you can't be alone with the child for now. What? Why? It's okay to have supervised visits. We should be able to clear it up soon enough. No, no, I don't want to do that. It's okay, Charlotte, just stay calm. I'm very calm, I just want to- - Stay in bed for me, please. Just tell me where he is. He's with his father, all right? If you can just lie back down, please. - What? - Okay? Look who it is. Oh, Mommy. - Look who it is. - No no no. That's not the dad. That's not. Just stay calm for me, okay Charlotte? - Thomas, what are you doing? - Charlotte. Please, please, Charlotte. Charlotte. Thomas, get away from him! Give me back my fucking child! Get him away from the baby! No! Please, you have to listen to me. You have to listen to me! He put something in my tea! He was gonna... What are you doing? Please, Thomas. We're gonna get you help. Thomas! Give me the baby. Open the door. Please, please! You have to open the door. Somebody help me!
