We'll be rewarded. The time draws near. The good kings emissary soon comes here. When yonder clock chimes with golden tone the banner of the king will be our own. Wealth and fame will be ours. Hamelin town is sure to be clockmaker to his majesty. Where is the clockmaker? Yes your honor? Have you completed the molds of the golden chimes? Well I cannot your honor, until this construction is prepared for exact measurements. I'm shock to view your efforts fragging. Woe to Hamelin if we're found lagging. Here now you precious little brats. Put on your gloves and get to work. During this emergency I proclaim a patriotic aim. We'll stretch each hour and crowd each minute. Work is more fun if all are in it. Therefore our little men and women will voluntarily eliminate school and play. Oh father, they have so little time as it is for play. Less than half an hour a day. Time for food and time for rest. How else can we make Hamelin best. But Truson will be furious. ’Twould indeed be curious if that fool were not. Your honor the mayor of Hamalout seeks audience with you. 'Toh ho, our rival of long tradition. Methinks he feels the pinch of competition. Truson! Truson! Holz told me of this new decree. Mara this time they've gone too far. But they hope to win the banner of the king. The children need to learn and play. To dance and sing in the sun of the day. The council's mad with envy and greed. Cherishing things of no use or need. A banner hear a metal there. Children bewildered, in despair. Songs outlawed, play forbidden. Love ignored. - It's outrageous. - I know. But the worst crime of all is melting down the gold of the town for chimes. Truson for my sake don't anger father. He angers me, it's time I spoke up. But I can't defy him. He could forget our marriage. Today he hinted. Oh, accept without protesting this new order. Just this once for me. "Just this once." How many times have I turn from their crimes because you feared to anger him. Each silence brought a harsher measure. Now not a minute is left for play. Someone in Hamelin must protest. Arouse the people. Force a test. Of who is strongest. What is right. He and the council has the power. Would you ask me not to fight? Deprive me of my sight. To see the world thru but one eye.

He'd stop at nothing to best us. Show the gentleman in. Remember, those who listen, smiling and wise are never taken by surprise. Mercy is a virtue you'll find a plenty here sir. We're doers sir not dreamers who cry into their beer sir. I come to tell of a cruel and tragic plight sir. The River Weser has overflowed its banks. All we process has been washed away. The fair city of Hamalout is submerged. Our people have taken to the hills with scant clothing and no food. So utterly desolated it is our city that even the rats have fled before the onrushing waters. Oh! There are no rats in Hamelin. Our needs are great. Children cold and hungry. Help us with food and shelter. Your kindness will rebuild our city. A pity,.. A deep felt pity. Yes, once it was a lovely city. Good sir we are deeply moved by your tragic plight. We'll search our purse and cast about for something worthy of Hamalout. Return to your people without further ado. We'll see what we can do for you. You have the everlasting gratitude of our children sir. Aw, me. 'Tis sad indeed to find an arrogant enemy in need. Our chief competitor wiped out. I feel a tear run down my snout. Three tears for the clock makers of Hamalout. I take it you reach your decision? We have. I take it we're unanimous. All agreed. We'll help them in their hour of need. What! We'll send our deepest sympathy. - Up course. - Indeed. I think the nicest way to tell them, our gentlest sentiments on the softest velum. Oh yes. Together with suggestions.. On how to guard... Against future floods in their front yard. - How nice of us. - To give advice. - To one of our competitors. - A word of warning gentlemen. There is danger still within the very gates of Hamelin. - With Hamalout not in competition? - Beware of complacency. There are other rivals in this race. This is no time to slacken our pace. Let's put our backs in our work. More effort by twice. - Make thrice. - Good advice. Thrice the work around the clock. - One for the tick. - And 2 for the tock. Oof! No time wasted for children in schooling and fooling. Nor women with their chatting and their tatting. No loss of the minutes any manner. If we’re to win the good kings banner. I protest! I protest! Oh, it's only Truson. Where in an official session. Get out. You'll hear me out. I'll make it plain for all to see how monstrous is your new decree. And he would be my son-in-law. Why I refuse, it is not hard to see. Your son-in-law I do not seek to be. Just husband to your daughter. Spouse to her and not a thing to me? How silly can he be? Aye,.. You robbed the children of learning, laughter and play. And darkened their lives in the sun of the day. You mock your neighbor in his hour of need. Blinded by arrogance, bloated with greed. You're selling your souls in the shoddiest manner for a worthless rag a king calls "a banner." A worthless rag! The banner of our king why... Its treason to even think such a thing! Hear me! Of all your stupid crimes, wasting our wealth for golden chimes, is a crime for which we'll have to pay. Deprive your children and you'll rue the day. Wh-who let him in?

Catch her before she falls! The mayors office! We're calling on the mayor! What is the meaning of this? A meeting is in progress! You have not been asked here. Help us! You have to do something! All complaints must be in writing. Father, we've been invaded! Invasion! Send a messenger to the king! We'll get the army! It must be the refugees from Hamalout! They will not invade us with their misfortune. Not by people father, we've been invaded by... Ouch! It's a plot! An evil conspiracy. The Hamalout citizens have sent their rats to us! What audacity! I'll issue fourth with a proclamation. Ouch! Tarnation! Oh father, not a proclamation. We need a fumigation to get rid of them. Aye, aye. That’s right. Quiet. Everyone be calm. I'll prove that this is just a false alarm. Let's put an end to this agitation. Your counsel has the situation firm in hand. Here is my proclamation. To be written on the finest vellum. It is herewith decreed that in this hour of need, each and every citizen we'll employ his wit and wisdom and ingenuity to end this willful act of retaliation of Hamalout. The meanest town in the nation. Here here! We know how. And we'll show how that we know how. We don't see how a decree will drive the creatures from Hamelin. They chase the dogs and kill the cats! And bite the babies in their cradle! - And eat the cheese right out the bag. - And lick the soup from the cooks own ladle. Fled off the kegs and soiled the sprats! They nest inside my Sunday hat! And even spoil the women's chats. My god there squeaking! Squeaking and squeaking. They never stop squeaking throughout the night. Good people,.. Rest assured your mayor and his council we'll treat this emergency with a keen sense of urgency. I promise you the counselors will think as hard as every other citizen for the duration of a crisis. Meanwhile before we give you a solution for this plague don't stand there looking vague! Beat them with brooms. Kill them with stones. Remember, the emissary of the king we'll tolerate no such thing. Mara, Truson listen! The music of the Piper. Oh Paul your imagining it again. Truson listen. You hear it don’t you? Yes I think I do. Yes! No Truson, there is no music. Methinks our mayor is a knotty. As for his counsel, shocking. To think we'd buy gown's lined with ermine for those who can't or won't determine how to read our town of vermin. Right, better give your brain a wracking. Find the remedy that's lacking or sure is fate will send you packing. - Yes. - Aye. Bolt the door! Did I promise too much when I said you'd think? Remember, everything's at stake. Our action now may make or break us. They'll never take us. This spot is ours. Now let's be calm and not forget we in Hamelin live by reason. Regardless of the season. Only in recent light can we end this blight. I have it! It's as simple as pork and sauerkraut. We'll flood them out. And suffer the fate of Hamalout. - The counselors a clown. - Or worse. Hamelin is in the grip of a curse. Let's face it this situations tragic. We'll not be saved, save by magic. Did you call me? Call me. Call me. Call me. Call me. Call me. The door was bolted. Who are you? Although I wear no robe of sable it so happens that I'm able to charm all creatures neath the sun. That creep or swim or fly or run. If you have an invention? I attract attention. Chiefly with a secret charm on creatures that do people harm. The mole the toad the newt and viper? Who doesn't know the Pied Piper. You have a trap? Ahh... Always they search for the better trap and other forms of tasty up hap. So dear to the hearts of every sap. No insult here your honor. On this, a special tune I'll play. And lure the rats away? Before their dawns another day. If such a thing can really be... You're the very man for me. There will be a fee. Naturally. I think you'll find our only fault is generosity. Then we'll have no difficulty striking a bargain. How much money in your treasury? - Ƒ50,000 guilders. - Stop! An idle boast sir. You fool. We'll be roasted over a pit for your lack of wit. Makers of bobbles, chimes and clocks. Leaders in virtue. Character builders. To rid your town of this verminous pox, my fee is ƒ50,000 guilders. - Ƒ50,000 - he's joking! - It's a hoax! Be gone you fraud! On your way. We have no time for your preposterous play. I don't hear anything from his pipe. Not a sound. What manner of music can it be that we can't hear it. And yet we see our children hear it. But I can't hear it. You do, don't you Truson? Yes. Magic your honor! Yon' man can play a tune on his pipe but none but the children hear. Tin cup, prankster enough of this hoax we'll have no more of your graceless jokes. It is but music, your honor. I hear no music from your pipe. Try as I can. On your way you tricky scamp. We have no need of you. And the rats? Have you need for them? Who else can get them out of your town? Tell us Piper is it true, can you send them on their way? With the music that I'll play. Music we cannot hear? The music I play for rats, you'll hear. For it...

What would you do with such a sum? Have fun! What are you? What manner of man? Figure it out as best you can. I'm a juggler one might say. I hold the night and the light of day. In a world that's such a mess with little room for happiness. I juggle it here and I toss it there. I take from the foul and give to the fair. With so much love in your heart sir surely you'll share apart sir with the unhappy children up Hamelin. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. If truly you can end this plague, this terrifying pestilence, you'll be cherished in their mind 100 years hence. An honor sir worth more by far than money. Whooping you joy. And a certain bliss beyond all dreams of avarice. I offer you in the name of our children, ƒ1000 guilders. Come again? 'Tis beneath my dignity to bargain. I'll make it ƒ10. Take it Piper. He knows my fee. I offer you ƒ20 that's more than plenty. Please we have a budget. Largest. The price is ƒ50. The man's without conscience minus a heart. He deserves a fate fashion to fit him. I'm forced most reluctantly to out wit him. The urgency of this emergency leaves us no choice because of the hard press state were in... - You win. - Eep! Ƒ50,000 guilders! You've lost your mind! But not in advance. Not until the vermin dancing are out. Every last one of them back to Hamalout! You heard him good people one and all. A bargains made. Though he sounded more like a rusty gate he's agreed to pay the going rate. - Hooray! - Yay! - Ok! - Sounds great! - Wonderful! - Yay! Now little friends, go to your homes. Sing your songs and read your poems. And have no fears. The music I play will not touch your ears. At the rise of the moon when the sun goes down, one plague will be gone from Hamelin town. He stolen your wits. How could you agree to such an exorbitant fee? It's all we have in our treasury! They'll be no gold for us to meltdown f-for the chimes for the glory of Hamelin town! Gentlemen gentlemen. Such trembling emotion. Let's drink a little soothing potion. For such lack of faith you'll soon atone. I was not made mayor for my beauty alone. Oof! There Truson, now the moon is rising. The moon is rising. Now we'll see if he is all he cracks himself up to be. Truson, I hear it. The music. I don't. Yes. Yes! Why don't you hear it? Why did you hear it this morning and not now? Can't you hear it now? No. Listen. I hear it. His pipe. Squeak squeak. Squeak. Squeak squeak. - Can you see them? - Yes. Look at them run. Squeak squeak. Squeak squeak. Squeak squeak. Squeak squeak. Squeak squeak. Don't fret child. That frightening music won't last long. What music mother? It's unbelievable. They fell asleep as soon as the music started. Squeak squeak. Squeak squeak. The Piper said the music wouldn't reach their ears. Squeak squeak. Awake awake! Come and hear the mayor's decree, proclamation of victory. Awake awake! Come and hear the mayor's decree, proclamation of victory. Awake! Awake! Attention attention! His honor the mayor. Citizens, your attention. I feel the gravest apprehension when joy is misdirected and unconfined. First let it show gratitude for our good fortune. Let me hear for our good counselors a thunderous cheer. - Hurray! - Hurrah! - Yay! - Hurrah! - Hip hip hurrah! Modesty forbids another hero of this occasion who's wit and wisdom ended the invasion. - Huzza - hurrah! - Yay! - Hurrah! I seek no applause or any renown. All I did was to save the town. Which is a mayor's duty. Now, an emergency. A letter from the kings emissary, he's on his way. He'll be here today. And our work is not completed. So, though the moment joyous, let it not decoy us. Smelters prepare the ovens for the gilders. The women, forget powder and puff and show your male sterner stuff. Let every kettle test your feminine metal. What's merely spic now makes spanner and Hamelin town will win the banner. Improve each shining hour. Back to you work on the tower. And now gentlemen to the council room and our own serious task. Let's break out the cast of cheeses and wine and make sure everything's, tasty from soup to pastry. Mr. Mayor, the pipers waiting for his fee. I'll see him presently. I have a request sir. At the feast, at least it would be proper to you have the children sing. How absurd, the children are not even to be seen! Much less heard. But without the children this is no town. If there's anything the kings emissary detest,.. Yes even worse than rats, it's a bunch of noisy brats at dinner. You can spoil the taste of rarest wine with some little darlings wail and whine. There is nothing makes food taste more vile than the yammer and clamor of a juvenile. By the way, where are the children? There with the Piper father. This is no time to pause.

Mother, the Pied Piper was just in the classroom... Now now now now wait just a minute. What is it Johnny? The Pied Piper was just in the school room and he did all sorts of magic things. He turned in apple into a snowball. He made the milk turn red. Add more than that, he rid us of those terrible rats. O mother, I hope he never leaves. Isn't there some way we can make him stay? Maybe... If we could turn snowballs back into apples. Aah! The burdens of office. The time has come to pay the Piper. But of course. In Hamelin, there is no frugality. Our spirit flows with liberality. My worthy colleague will bring the receipt. All you have to do is sign on the designated dotted line. Without reading you have me sign? Your signatures a mere formality required in any municipality. Uh, just to say you got your pay. Come on Piper we're in a hurry. I think I better read it. You'll find nothing improper sir, just here and there a clause to conform with custom and the laws. I'll read it. Well, were busy men but if you must then... Unroll the scroll. Just here and there a clause to conform with the laws? "To be held in escrow for 100 years?" A mere formality regarding your fee. A hedge against litigation, inflation in currency. I see. And this? A guarantee and warranty. A stipulation that your fee be forfeit should there be pollution of the river. No danger of course. But required by the courts under the law of torts. And this about rebuilding roads. Required by our building codes. I see as we go up the line the print gets rather fine. "Reparations?" A safeguard for future generations. Ah, this is best. Aw, cleverer than the rest. Mere legal art. Protecting the party of the first part. I am now to deposit with you the sum of ƒ1000 guilders. Guaranteeing the plague will never return. And if by chance they do, then I owe you? Ƒ50,000 guilders. Men of Hamelin settle your debt. Is that a threat? All we ask is you meet our stipulations. Maneuvers of manipulations. How dare you sir. In all our dealings to prevent ill feelings we require a legal form. 'Tis no departure from the norm. Come fellow your name on paper. As a rule I refrain from calling any man a fool. Heed me now... I'll wait until yon clock strikes the hour. Don't let me go away without my pay. Here a catch and there a clause. Here to the "whereas" in our laws. Give the order. Now we'll have golden chime.

Easily reelected. But I don't want to marry the kings emissary. I don't even know him. Know him you shall and without delay. You'll meet him at the gate today. Make haste, don't wait another second. Array yourself in your finest gown. The kings emissary must look on you as the fairest in our fair town. But I must see Truson now. Not now or ever. You'll see him never. - No one can keep us apart. - We'll see. Now my colleagues remember, not a word about the chimes until they are ready. Even if he ask a hundred times to see them, be steady. Divert him engage him. Keep his mind on other things until he hears the clock that rings its golden notes. - Understood? - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. I'll handle the meeting and greeting. Mr. Mayor! For the last time pay the Piper. Why you foolish fellow we did our part. Trickery deceit. The kings emissary will be told about Hamelin. Shiny without, tarnished within. You win no battle while I can speak. Speak! Where we'll put you we'll hear no shriek. Arrest this pettifog! - No! - No! - No! - No! - No! - This self seeking demagogue. What are the charges? Troublemaker. Sower of treason. Disloyalty or loss of reason. We'll find the proper ordnance to cover your offense. Away with him! ♫ We bid you a welcome most wonderful one. ♫ ♫ We've heard of all the high and mighty things you have done. ♫ ♫ We welcome you proudly your excellency. ♫ ♫ The powers of that volley of the powers that be. ♫ ♪ We here you have the strength of 20 and the courage of a lion. ♪ ♪ The fame of you has even reached the constellation of Orion. ♪ ♫ We know the future of our city lives in your hands. ♫ ♫ So we'll make hast to satisfy utmost demands. ♫ ♫ We bid you welcome. Bid you welcome. Bid you welcome. ♫ ♫ Bid you welcome. ♫ ♫ Hail hail to him. ♫ ♫ Today! ♫ Please. Please. Please. Such vulgar vigor. I am not attune to such rigorous enthusiasm. Spare me a nervous spasm. And now I dare say that you have a key to offer me? Why yes, excellency. Welcome... Welcome sire. A symbol of our graduate and our... Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Good fellow, before you start I know that speech by heart. And now no doubt you have a daughter somewhere about to, ha ha, present to me? Excellency, how did you know? Ha ha, it's always so. It doesn't always thus. And now let me see... What... brought me here to this... Hamlet of Hamelin. The banner excellency. Oh! Yes, yes, yes, the competition. Get on with it mayor. You see my time has a limit. I have another place to visit. A city called Hamalout. Ha! Ha! Ha! Hamalout! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Hamalout? I'm sorry, truly sorry. But you'll find that this time a visit to poor unfortunate Hamalout a waste of your precious time. I fear Hamalout will not vie for honors in the competition this year. Besides,.. We thought you'd wish to dine first. Dinner, no. But uh.. I do have a... Ahem! Choking thirst. His excellency has a thirst! Bring out the wines! So I kept the lady-in-waiting waiting, waiting, waiting, and waiting. Let's get down to the business at hand. What exhibit am I to view? Not yet your excellency for the clock makers work on the chimes is not nearly through. Let's ply him on wine. A little more won't hurt him. No no, he's had his fill. We must find other means to divert him. Chess? Now now gentlemen, let's proceed. A little less talk, a little more speed. Patience noble sire. Let me temp your palette. These Arabian plums are ripe and succulent. The nectar of Beaujolais grapes can temper a temper that's... truculent. This Persian melon not too tart not too mellow. No, no fruit for me. Look what an apple did to that poor fellow. Enough of this feasting and cheer let's get on with..? Whatever the occasion that brought me here. All in good time your excellency. Time! Time, it has something to do with a clock. That's it! Your excellency, before your official inspection may I turn your attention in this direction. You may. You may! You may! Quickly Truson. I have a key. The jailors a friend. You must escape. I can't leave now. But why? I want to go with you. No Mara. Running away is not the solution. Don't you see? We'll not find peace anywhere else until we find it here, first. But I fear for your safety if you stay. I know they mean to harm you. You said you were willing to run away with me. Are you just as willing to stay here in Hamelin... Stand beside me while I fight?

Music of the Piper. No Truson he's gone. Yes gone. And now our honor with him. That's what I fear. What the Piper will do to us? No. What we've done to ourselves. I’m afraid of music I cant hear. Music! He's come back! Paul? Paul, where're you going? Do you not hear the Piper? No. Now where is he? The music is coming from over there. He's calling us. Listen to me! Can't you hear me?! Jeffery! Michael! Debby. Kathy. Don't go! He looks content. Is bouquet of the wine and the foods aroma. The man's achieved a happy coma. Father. Father! Shhh! Father he's taking the children! The children can be fed later. No, please listen. The Pied Piper waltzed them away. They're bewitched. Which? Gone! The children gone! I last saw him going towards the river. Oh the children! The children. If truly this is an emergency, be thankful that your mayor is me. Why they're dancing, they're gay. Take them on the mountain path. He'll lead them up and knead them down. That path goes nowhere but back to town. Of course, they'll come upon the cliff. The wall of stone. No one has ever claimed it. They'll be home. Aye-aye of course. No! No, it cannot be! Look! You'll need no glass to see! What? What now? The mountain! No! It has opened! The wall opened! Your leaving me Piper! Don't leave me! Take me with you! Please take me too! Take me! Is my boy here?

I know you and your counselors are busy with important affairs and... I'll only take a moment of your time. It's about Johnny. Who's Johnny? He's my son. You remember the boy with the curly red hair, the boy who opened your carriage door for you once. He's gone. Looked everywhere and... I can't seem to find him. And I know such men as wise as you can surely help me find a small boy. Why don't you answer me? Your decisions have always been so... Quick and so clever. Like the way you handled the Piper. I understand your concern for our welfare and I won't bother you again ever. But he's only just a baby. Your honor, I know you understand. Because you have a child of your own. We've been up all night. The sun will rise in a minute. This mountain is solid granite. I don't believe we ever went in it. It was you who saw them go. Beware when their mothers woe turns to wrath. Where is the mayor? Where tired of his speeches and his deceit. He must be around here somewhere. Our patience is at an end. We demand to see the mayor. Where is he? There blasting open the mountain side with a canon. That will surely bring back your children. Canon and artillery!? What medicine for our misery. Now its ingredients must be blended with the strictest obedience. One part... White powder. There we go. And one part. One part black. And 2 parts sulfur. There we are. To uh... to complete the stack. Let's see, one pinch for the pot. You there. Clean the cannon and insert the ball and I'll assign task for one and all. I've uh... figured the target. I've uh... measured the distance. I even allowed for wind resistance. Oh, incidentally, I once wrote a directory on missiles and their trajectory. I blew up a fortress, killed 104. I would have won a medal but we weren't at war. Fusileer are you in the rear? Come here. Ready the fuse. No time to lose. Apply the light and I'll watch the flight. Your excellency, if I do, they'll be a big hole in you. I don't mean to offend but... You see you're standing at the wrong end. Oh! Yes, how clever of you to mention. I'm merely wanted to see if you were paying attention. Ooh! Ooooh. The campaign is over the last shot is fired and I am tired. We blasted this mount inside and out and nary a cry from a child. We must find a way to save their lives. The votes of the husbands the wrath of their wives. You set my nerves atwitter with all this bitterness. Lackey my litter! No no don't go. You know it's suddenly too absurd, children lured by a Piper who's music no one's heard. What children do you speak of, pray? I saw no one throughout the day. Anywhere. Me thinks I smell conspiracy. Mayhaps. Gid-yap! What ingratitude. Father, everyone's looking for you. There's trouble in the air, the people are waiting in the square. Eh? Oh, of course, well I'll be there they know that they can trust their mayor. - To do what? - Yes what? - What can you do? - What. - What. - What. - What. - What. - What. Quiet! Stop squealing and squeaking as if you were rats. Remember that you're bureaucrats. We done it before we'll do it again. We'll manage them. When you have a stratagem? It says oldest the kingdom I know it by rote. To escape their wrath, scape the goat. And the person? Truson. Oh no father. Who's the cause of your sorrow and misery? Who's to blame for this deviltry? That viper the Piper. Who brought him here? Let grief not dim our memories. Were victims of Truson's sorceress. - Truson? - Truson? - Truson? - Truson? - Truson? Let not sorrow blithe our reason Truson must be hanged for treason! - Oh no. - Truson. - Truson. - Oh no. It's not true! He did not but say, we had a debt to pay. What further proof is needed of his sorcery. He had turned my child against me! He's the culprit, he's the one! Who lost your daughter and lost your son. Mr. Mayor, hanging me will never bring voice back to laugh and sing. He's right. We want our children! Did not Truson revel in the music of that devil the Piper? Which none of us heard. I tell you they're in league. They even look alike. No! No father! There's music all around us that you will never hear. While the clink of the golden guilder rings loudest in your ear. - I'm just trying to.. - I just want my... Our hearts must find a way to accept the bitter fate of all who failed to pay the Piper. You've lost your children. A heart wounding blow. Yet they lost their parents long ago. - True. - True. - True. - True. - True. But is there nothing we can do? Seek your heart relief and acceptance of your fate and find consolation in helping others. People of Hamelin be not misled by this criminals harangue. First things first. Let's see this scoundrel hang. Then for all the world to see for our children a shining golden plaque. In loving memory. No golden plaque will ever return your children. There is a way that you can find solace. The homeless children of Hamalout would be warmed with our love and our treasury’s gilders. - We will. - Yes. - Ok. - Let's do it. - Fine. Instead of being saddened by your grief you're madden. Mark you, on another calmer day, you'll see that mine was the wiser way. What he calls love and decency is the shortest route to bankruptcy. Enough of talk that covers greed. Fathers and mothers have a need to seek an end to grief and sorrow. To face with hope a new tomorrow. The time has come to make a change. Mara? How better to start Paul, on his mission of mercy, then for us to pray. Made the news of our determination spread throughout the land. That grieving parents of Hamelin take all children to their hearts as their own kin. O father in thy words suffer little children to come on to us as we kneel in silent prayer. Truson do you hear it? Yes. I hear it. I hear the music of the Piper. I hear my child's voice. Oh no dear, you're just imagining it. I'm not imagining it. That's my child's voice! Mother! Mother! Hey mom! Oh daddy! - Mother! - Mommy! Mother! Oh John! The bells! {\Move (400,10,190,270,100,400)\fad (0,1000)\fscx25\fscy25\t (0,6000, \fscx125\fscy125)\c&h000000f&\3c&0000a6&} Subtitles by: MightyMike77020 Joel & Noel
