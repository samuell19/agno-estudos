Ripped and synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Based on letters and diary entries written by Queen Victoria and on the comedy play Mädchenjahre einer Königin by Sil-Vara Victoria in Dover London, 19 June 1837 his majesty, the king of Belgium. My dear brother, we have been living in our dear old Kensington palace for nearly 20 years now. Every day is the same. I write letters, my ladies do needlework and Victoria studies. I watch over the dear child day and night... “England is a rich, cultivated and civilized country. Thanks to the wise leadership...” “England is a rich, cultivated and civilized country. Thanks to the wise lea... Wise leadership...” “England is a rich, cultivated and civilized country. Thanks to the wise leadership of our sovereign rulers...” Princess? Princess? Princess. Victoria! “Thanks to the wise leadership...” “...of our sovereign rulers, the people know nothing of hardship, poverty or hunger.” Very good. I'm hungry. Princess... Princess? “As a result, the people have great affection and loyalty toward their ancestral dynasty.” Very good. Princess, you look a little tired today. Oh, no! I feel quite awake again. Tea? May I ask a few more questions, your majesty? Of course. Dean davys, your lesson will be over in two minutes. Your offer of tea was premature. King Edward vi. He made the anglican church the church of england. What did king Charles il do? Charles 11? Mensch, what did he do? Victoria! What a crude expression! Forgive me, mother. It just slipped out. But it isn't crude. That's how they talk in Germany. Isn't that right, baroness? Yes. There's really no harm in it. Thank you for educating me. Mensch' your highness? What? Oh, nothing. Wait a moment! Where are you going? I'm not having anything, thank you. Charles il restored... He restored... He restored... - He restored... - National influence! The anglican church and expanded england's overseas territories. Mary I of england? Attempted to restore catholicism. I marvel at your memory, Princess. So do I. Tomorrow, we shall discuss the economic situation in the colonies. - You've already eaten, Victoria. - Just one! But that's enough. But they're so small, your highness. Baroness lehzen, that's the second time you have lectured me today. Mr. taglioni is waiting in the music room for your dance lesson. Leave your tea. Come now. I cannot dismiss this woman. She, of all people, is the Princess's confidante. Unfortunately. Gluttonous, too! She sneakily took a sandwich with her. That's just like her. Thank you! Princess? Today we will learn to walk naturally. If you'd be so kind. Music, please. Note the spring in my step. Always natural, always natural. And the supple shape of the body, always natural. And the flowing body movements, natural, always natural. Mensch, how stiff-legged he is. Baroness! What a crude expression! Would you like to try now, Princess? Excellent! Exquisite! I just need to walk unnaturally and he will be satisfied. His majesty, the king of Belgium. His majesty? Good day, my dear sister. Leopold! I had no idea you were in england. I've just written you a letter. I come from windsor. You were in windsor? Yes. The king is on his deathbed. What is the matter? Please forgive me. The end is expected at any hour. Victoria must not be kept in the dark any longer. The unsuspecting child. - How so? Does she not know? - She knows nothing! We had no idea ourselves that the king would deteriorate so quickly. I mean, is she still unaware that she's to become queen when the king dies? Oh, I see. No, she doesn't know that, either. I've kept it strictly secret from her until now. I wanted to protect her childlike nature... For as long as possible. But now, of course, I shall immediately... No. It would be highly dangerous to upset her childlike nature with the heavy blow of news such as this. No, the realization that she is the future queen of england must dawn on her slowly and gently. I'd like to speak with her governess, baroness lehzen. What? That woman is to tell her? I think this is a matter for her mother, no one else. I quite agree, my dear sister. Naturally. Nonetheless, I think the baroness could prepare her. You know, my dear brother, you always get what you want. Inform the baroness. Yes, your highness. And sir Conroy is to be sent to me, too. Lady lyttelton, keep your spectacles on, even when you're not working, please. What were we saying? - My apologies. - Oh, yes. I've waited for this day for 18 years. And now that it's come, I can scarcely believe it. My child is to become queen. Long ago, a gypsy woman predicted that Victoria... My dear sister, please spare me your gypsy tales. And now, Princess, please extend your hand for a kiss. No, not like that, Princess. Always naturally, slowly, with your arm outstretched like this. Just so, Princess. Wonderful! Excellent! Exquisite! You will make wonderful progress if you remember the most important thing is to be natural, always natural, Princess. Sir Conroy, the duchess wishes to see you immediately. - Has something happened? - No. I mean, yes. Not yet. I fear we're all about to see great changes. I see. The Princess may be a child still, but she's much wiser than other girls her age. Yes, I know. She understands the responsibilities of a ruler, without suspecting that one day she herself will have to bear the heavy burden of this responsibility. We have you to thank for this wise upbringing. That's why I would not want anyone else to alert the Princess, in an intelligent and delicate manner, to the fact that her big moment is approaching. Thank you for your confidence in me, your majesty. Do as you see fit, baroness. Now I would like to see the dear child. What will happen when Victoria becomes queen? Will we all have to leave? Or will she give us a position in the royal household? Don't worry so much, ladies. - Leave it all to me. - Oh, please. I shall... - Magnificent weather today, isn't it? - Just marvelous. I was actually hoping to go fishing, but... - Oh, do! We get such good fish... - Trout... The trout yesterday evening was just delicious, simply superb... We must disarm this woman as soon as possible. - Who is it? - It's a surprise. Uncle Leopold! I'm so glad you're here! I have to return to Brussels today, but I wanted to give you a good-bye kiss. Can't you stay a few days longer? Sadly not. My country awaits me, duty calls. Your dear mother has been telling me of your progress. I'm very happy. Is there something you'd like as a reward? There is something I've wanted for a long time. My dear uncle, my dear mother, please, may I have just one hour to myself each day? Does this mean that I disturb you? Indeed not, mother, but... I'd like one hour a day on my own. So this is the fate of a loving mother. You worry day and night, and then you're in your daughter's way. I don't understand it. I just don't understand it. My child, I fear your request has offended your mother. I didn't mean to. I withdraw my request. Come. She wants to be alone. Baroness lehzen has talked her into it. Compose yourself, duchess. She won't have long left to talk. Hopefully not. A handkerchief! Handkerchief! - Here you are. - Thank you, my dear sir Conroy. The child is so ungrateful! Condemnably ungrateful. - Unbelievable! - I can't even find the words. - It's incomprehensible. - Ladies! You're talking about the future queen of england! Please leave me on my own. You haven't told me about your confirmation. It was magnificent, uncle! I wore a white lace dress, a white gauze veil, and a crown of tiny white roses, beautiful! But my confirmation was the most solemn occasion of my life. I'm glad this solemn day made such an impression on you, my child. Keep it that way. Religion is the most important thing. You should talk at length about the church of england. Without tying yourself down, of course. First of all, there must be a change of cabinet. Lord Melbourne and his government must disappear. Very well. But who knows what will replace his government? I will worry about that. In lord Melbourne's hands, Victoria will be a puppet that dances to his tune. Positively. You should also stress, time and again, that you were born in england. - Is that so important, uncle? - Very important. Especially since you're of German ancestry. I'd like to say good-bye to your dear mother. I'll call her. I must apologize to her. I shall creep in from behind her on tiptoe, cover her eyes and give her a kiss. Then everything will be well again. Safe journey, uncle. And you must be more assertive in future. But what should I do? You must take a large annual income from your government... Why are you so worried about my finances, all of a sudden? Who else will take care of your future... If I do not? Victoria! Uncle Leopold wishes to say good-bye. So soon? Forgive me, sir Conroy, I'll be right back. Princess? I'm glad to see you. Here you are, Princess. I've been looking all over. What's the matter? Princess, what is it? Has something happened? Princess, say something. Won't you tell me what's making you so unhappy? - Shall I call your mother? - No! Compose yourself, Princess. Don't cry. It's time for our history lesson. Can it not wait until tomorrow? No, Princess. Come. - At least let us stay here. - Very well. Today we shall look at the history of the illustrious house of Hanover. I've drawn up an accurate family tree for you. Well, then? “George I, elector of Hanover, was crowned king of england in 1714. Then came George il, 1727-1760. George lll, 1760-1820. George iv...” - That was my uncle. - Yes. And he was followed by his brother, our current king, William iv. “His children, Charlotte and Elizabeth... Who died in 1819 and 1821.” So he has no descendants. If the king were to die... If the king were to die... There would be... There would be... No-one left except... Except... Me. I want to be good. Announce us immediately. Lord Cunningham, the archbishop of canterbury... But everyone in the palace is fast asleep. Wishes to speak with the duchess immediately. This enchanted palace will soon come to life. A new age is dawning. Indeed. - Your highness, we bring sad news. - Dead? - I shall wake her at once. - No, let us leave the queen to rest. No, I shall wake her. She's said to be defiant and headstrong. She's devout... And honest. The sun is just coming up. Perhaps that is a good omen. She's coming. We have the unhappy duty of bringing you news of the king's death. He died peacefully and devoted to god, your majesty. I want to be a good queen. And no effort and no fatigue, no matter how great, shall seem burdensome to me if it is for the welfare of my people. Lord Melbourne, the head of your majesty's government, will visit your majesty in the next hour. My queen. Oh, my queen! There are no words needed between us. My only friend. Be the same to me as you ever have been. Thank you, your majesty. Victoria! I have lived for this moment. Now heaven has repaid my fear and worry. You are queen of england! Thank you, mother, for everything you have done for me. My dear child, you will learn from the very start that the days of a monarch are never their own. I shall work tirelessly. There are some important circumstances to consider. Never let yourself be pushed into making immediate decisions. Always ask your dear mother first. So, my child. And now the most important thing. When lord Melbourne comes to present himself as the head of your government, then tell him the following... “It is my wish that your lordship stand down from your office as head of my government, and from your other current ministerial duties.” It's all written here so you don't forget. - Is this not sir Conroy's hand? - Yes. He is our most faithful adviser. No one shall be allowed in our circle. Only sir Conroy, no one else. Will you promise me that? Sir Conroy has certainly done you a great many services, and I shall offer him an annual income. That is very good of you, Victoria. At the same time, I decree that he vacate his residence here at the palace and that he never again appear in my presence for as long as I live. But my child, he was always my closest friend. Victoria! Take it back. It's slander, do you hear? Spread by this baroness lehzen. I have never discussed it with baroness lehzen. And from today onward I want my own bedroom. Is this in earnest? Yes. I wish to be alone. Are you cutting yourself off from me? This is what I have lived for. This is what I have lived for, waiting years for this day. I do not deserve this, Victoria. Your majesty. George. Your majesty. - Does your majesty have any orders? - Yes. When lord Melbourne arrives, show him to the parlor and he shall wait for me there. But all the others, the geography professor, the dancing master... Send them away. Yes, your majesty. Just for once, I want an hour to myself. My lord is requested to wait here for her majesty. Thank you. Lord Melbourne. Good morning, baroness. You poor thing. Roused from your bed so early this morning. Heck, yes. These english monarchs only ever die at night to spite me. The child, Victoria. It had to happen to me. If I were a man, the challenge would excite me. To turn this child into a queen. And it does excite me. That is precisely what bothers me. In what school of politics do you plan to educate our inexperienced queen? Mine, of course. I don't doubt it for a moment. I'm glad you're so open. We may be candid diplomats, yet we're treated with the greatest suspicion. But I hope we may truly trust one another, baroness. Let us be friends. If you wish to be a true friend to Victoria. I can only be so if you permit it. Whatever advice Victoria receives, you, baroness, have the last word as her friend. I have a request, baroness. Here in england, we have forgotten how to present a young queen at the great council. I'd like to do some reading on the subject. - You'll find everything in the library. - Many thanks. Have the guards of honor arrived? Fifteen minutes ago. There are two giants at each door. We're not at all used to it here at Kensington palace. There are many things you'll have to get used to. I believe you're right. For Melbourne! It is my wish that you, lord Melbourne, stand down from your office as head of my government, and from your other current ministerial duties. Stop! Why are you tiptoeing around? Your majesty, I've come to pay my respects and to ask for a sign of your majesty's confidence in me. Your majesty, you must say something. Otherwise, I'm not permitted to stand up. Oh, I see. Yes. Your majesty, allow me to give you a piece of advice. If your majesty does not know what to say to someone, as will often be the case now, I'd recommend simply extending your hand without saying a word. - That does not commit you to anything. - Yes. No one is permitted to introduce themselves to the queen of england. Your majesty can of course ask anyone their name. Yes, of course. Who are you? Lord Melbourne. You are lord Melbourne? It is my wish that you, lord Melbourne, remain in your office as head of my government, and in your other current ministerial duties. Forgive me, your majesty, but is there not some mistake? No, no mistake. Thank you for your faith in me, your majesty. I shall try to lessen the hardships that accompany your majesty's work on the most powerful soil on earth. I lay all my life's experience at your feet. I want to be a true servant to you, your majesty, if you will do me the honor of allowing me to. Thank you, lord Melbourne. - I'm so frightened. - That is fitting, your majesty. If your majesty were not frightened, your majesty would have no understanding of the tremendous responsibility weighing on your majesty's shoulders. In one hour, I'm to give my big official speech. I shall not be able to speak a word, I"m sure of it. What should I do? Your majesty, I myself did not yet know until a few minutes ago. But I've been reading up on it. - Shall we try a little dress rehearsal? - Yes, please. Let's suppose this is the throne room. We need a throne for this, actually. Where is...? Ah, here. This is the throne. That is the entrance to the throne room. Your majesty will descend the great marble staircase from the upstairs chambers, two lords-in-waiting will open the door, and your majesty will enter from the left. Just a moment, your majesty. I must announce you first, your majesty. What, you? Yes, on ceremonial occasions, the prime minister does it himself. Her majesty, the queen. A little further, please, the throne room is bigger than this room. There. Now your majesty stands in the center of the room. Dignitaries of the empire surround the throne. Church dignitaries, ministers, generals... I feel quite dizzy. Take a deep breath, your majesty. It will pass. Then everyone bows. Your majesty bows, too. Not so low. Just with your head, please. Excellent... but not so many times. Just once to the right, and once to the left. Very good. Then your majesty gestures with your arm to indicate that the men may rise. Not so stiff. Graceful, natural. I've learned that from master taglioni! “Always natural!” Very nice, but we do it more like this. Yes, just like that. Then your majesty walks to the throne. Without the arm movement, the men have already raised their heads. - Oh, yes. - Then you sit down, your majesty, and extend your hand to the representative of the grand council, the Duke of Sussex, for a kiss. - My old uncle will kiss my hand? - Yes, that is the etiquette. Well, then! What next? Then your majesty stands up again... Then I will hand your majesty the scroll, and you will read from it slowly and as clearly as possible. That's it. I shall not be able to speak a word, I know it. You will. Your majesty, you will fulfill your first magisterial duties magisterially. - Will no one ask me any questions? - No, don't worry. Anyway, I'll be standing right here beside you, your majesty. Now and forever? Yes, your majesty. But your majesty, now you must get dressed. Yes. Mensch, I'm still in my dressing gown! Good-bye, I'll be right back! So? A splendid girl. Lord Melbourne! I mean, a splendid queen. Oh, I see. Her majesty, the queen! Since it pleases almighty god to appoint me to this office, I will do my utmost to do my duty to my country. I'm very young... And inexperienced in many, perhaps all, matters. But I'm sure that no one has such good intentions as I to do what is right. And so I vow to defend law and justice... And to promote the happiness and well-being of my subjects. This I swear to do. Long live the queen! The queen! The queen! I'm glad to see your majesty is in good spirits. Yes, because I know they're happy with me. - I'm making every effort, am I not? - Indeed, your majesty. To the queen! There's the funny little paper boy. George? Buy a few newspapers for me. But your majesty. All of them? Hurrah! Leave them under a tree or give them away. - But I wanted to read them. - No, your majesty. You don't read newspapers anymore. Tell me, lord Melbourne, is there anything in the papers that I'm not to know? Oh, no, your majesty. Is it not splendid weather? And these magnificent trees! Marvelous! You once advised me to change the subject and talk about the weather - when I do not wish to answer a question. - True, but this was quite unintentional. There must be much to conceal from me. Will you promise me no longer to concern yourself with newspapers? Is it not splendid weather? And these magnificent trees! Marvelous! Isn't that so? I raised her to be a queen. Then she came under the influence of baroness lehzen and now only lord Melbourne's advice matters. He takes her to the theater, goes riding with her, tells her stories. Even pensioners in their graves hear her laugh out loud. Well, he's a curious prime minister. That's why I asked you to come to London, dear brother. You must talk to him. Do you have my newspapers? Yes. But unfortunately, lord Melbourne noticed and confiscated them. He says there is nothing of any interest in the papers. So you have both conspired against me. I want to know what is happening in the world! But your ministers tell you, your majesty. I want to know what the ministers say, too! But I can get newspapers without your help, too. I'm sorely disappointed. Don't be offended. You both want to keep something from me to spare me some pain or worry. I'm not offended, your majesty. My visit is purely personal. I merely wish to inquire after my niece. The queen is in the best of health. She works, laughs, dances, sings, rides. May god preserve her childlike disposition. Yes, and I shall assist him. I have made it my mission in life to protect her against whatever fate may throw at her. But do you not think that there is little place for your way of conducting state business in a light-hearted fashion? She's a child who needs nurturing. And that is what I'm doing. But in my own way. You there! Get me a few of today's newspapers, quickly. - As many as you can find. - Yes, your majesty. But bring them straight to me, through this window here. Got it? Yes, your majesty. And when you've got them, whistle. Yes, your majesty. You, come here. Get me today's newspapers, as many as you can. - Newspapers? - Nothing to write home about. Hurry! Send for lord Melbourne. King Louis Philippe of France invites your majesty to visit him in Paris. Impossible at the moment. Perhaps when I have more time. Why are you so serious today? Uncle Leopold has just instructed me to be composed. He thinks I'm too cheerful for a statesman. He also gave me good advice on foreign policy. Really? He should let us govern england how we want to. May I be cheerful once again, then? - I command it. - Thank you. - I have another new card trick. - Really? Show me! I mean... after we've done our work. Your majesty, I need your signature. Self-government of the colonies? We ministers deliberated over this problem one rainy afternoon, when we had no idea what else to do with ourselves. Will we not become alienated from the colonies and ultimately lose them? I don't believe so. England will remain the rich uncle and the colony will be the poor, faithful relation. Your majesty, england is big, very big. And mankind is small. One day, the time may come when the responsibility of governing our vast empire is beyond human power. In order to safeguard your majesty's estates, we've sought to find a way out. Self-government of the colonies. Lord Melbourne, you're a genius. It is valuable, your majesty, to understand, embrace and implement good ideas. King William refused to sign this 14 times. - Will it hold? - Yes. Give it here. - What, on there? - Yes, yes. Now, lord Melbourne, tell me how things look in my country. Are the people happy with me? Or do my people worry? Well, your majesty, what should I tell you? Nothing. I mean, I don't want to take up your valuable time. Not at all, your majesty. I'm really not missing out on anything. No, no, you still have to prepare so that everything goes to plan with the dubbing of lord aberdeen. - It will go to plan, your majesty. - You can never be sure. Sometimes you prepare everything and then it doesn't go to plan. - Shall I see again that all goes to plan? - One more time. Very well, then I shall practice some more. Please do. And I don't wish to be disturbed now. Thank you! Her majesty does not wish to be disturbed. Your majesty, it's time for the investiture ceremony... Where did your majesty get these newspapers? - Your majesty, it's time. - Yes. I'm coming. Lord aberdeen, as a sign of our appreciation and gratitude, it is our wish that you be installed as knight of the bath and that you be awarded the grand cross of the order of the bath. You shall honor god, you shall protect the queen, you shall devote yourself to the poor and defend the wise, and oppose any oppression. Lord aberdeen, I hereby knight thee. I would like to talk with lord Melbourne, lord palmerston and lord Russell at once. God and my right the new knight of the bath has just sworn to defend the poor and to oppose oppression. Ministers, I ask you, are these merely words or will these oaths be kept in my realm? It is a medieval decoration, your majesty, and it is not always possible... But it must always be possible from now on! - It's not as simple as that, your majesty. - Can I not issue commands in my own realm? Your majesty should not agonize over such things. That's what we're here for. But I want to agonize over it! Do you want a people where poor children must work over 13 hours in the factories? Do you want a people where helplessness, desperation, hunger and oppression in england are not just empty words? Do you want a people where... Where did your majesty get this information? I'd like an answer to my questions. Your majesty, to satisfy hunger and to maintain order, that is why we have our parliament. Then I want laws to be drawn up immediately to make the lot of the poor more bearable. Do you hear? It is my wish. Or I no longer wish to be queen. - What"s wrong with the queen? - The childhood illness of all monarchs... The delusion that they can improve the world. - I've never seen her like that before. - It will pass. But she's right, it is time to think about reforms. And then... The queen will need to marry. Baroness. I'm so unhappy. Your majesty. Your majesty, you must be happy. Once one has identified an ailment, then one knows how to cure it. And your majesty has identified the cause of england's suffering. And you will restore it to health. I hope so. But lord Melbourne, the queen is still far too young to marry. A queen is never too young to marry. But we cannot make arrangements for the life of such a dear, sweet creature as simply as that. Why should we deprive the child of the most beautiful thing in life, the feeling of awakening love? Baroness, I love the queen just as you do. And just as you, I only wish for her to be happy. She will fall in love with the man I've chosen for her. He's prince Albert of saxe-coburg. A German? Mensch, why didn't you say so! 'What does he look like? No idea. But from everything I've heard, he's a born prince consort. It will be so wonderful. So, are we still allies? Yes. - So, mother, how do you like this hat? - Very good. Isn't it? I think it's sweet, too. But this one is enchanting. Look. Very pretty. But, my child, I have something very important to discuss with you. Yes. And what about this one? Very pretty. It's just delightful, your majesty. But it makes you seem a little too old. - Really? - Yes. - I have something for you, too. - For me? Here. Doesn't she look sweet? Very sweet. My dear child, it is about your birthday. Yes, lord Melbourne promised me he would organize a wonderful ball. He's already waiting in the study. I'm talking about your birthday meal today with your close family, and I thought it would be a good opportunity I'm to marry? The prince of orange is a charming young man. Is this uncle Leopold's idea? No, the good ideas are always mine. He wants you to marry grand Duke Alexander. And he will be there this evening, too? Yes, but I'm completely against that marriage. I'm for... My dear mother, please don't trouble yourself, I shall marry neither of them. But Victoria! I have to get to work, but give uncle Leopold my regards and tell him I'll marry no one at all in the next 20 years. - No one at all? - No one at all! Do not be cross, lord Melbourne, that I've kept you waiting so long. So? - Delightful. - Pardon? I mean, your hat. Oh, I still have it on! So what do you have for me? The new law, decided by your majesty and passed by parliament, a radical reform of relief for the poor. Thank you, lord Melbourne, for satisfying my request so quickly. Here are a few judgments from the military court. They include harsh punishments. Following my reform of the criminal justice system, which aims to do away with capital punishment, the only crimes still punishable will be high treason, murder, piracy, rape... Rape? What is that? You don't know what rape is, your majesty? No, what is it? It is violation. It is difficult to... If "m to sign something, I need to know what it concerns. Yes, your majesty. How can I explain it? Rape concerns something, not inherently repugnant, that a man inflicts upon a woman against her will. But your majesty, we'll set the law aside for another year. Your cousin, your majesty, prince Albert of saxe-coburg. He's enchanting! I'm glad, your majesty. Lord Melbourne, he must come visit us some day. He's coming today. Really? And will he be staying long? Hopefully. Your majesty is to marry him. Now you're starting, too. Everyone wants to marry me off, my mother, my uncle, you. You even want me to marry a child! The child is 25 years old. He's stunted? No, your majesty. I just wasn't able to get a picture of him as an adult. Albert will be at your birthday dinner today... He's coming too? There will be three suitors here at once! Only mine will come into consideration. Lord Melbourne, I'm warning you, you do not know me. I will not be pressured into this! And I will not marry. You have miscalculated this time. It is a matter of pride that I have never miscalculated in my life. She does not want to marry at all. You asked her outright? Very diplomatically, of course. You know me. I do know you. Your diplomacy can destroy an entire generation. Leopold! - I'm speechless. - For the first time. Come in, George. At your command, your majesty. Tell baroness lehzen to be ready to travel to windsor for a few days. Wait, one more thing. George, can you keep a secret? If your majesty commands it, I can. Can you drive? You must be able to drive. If your majesty commands it, I can drive, too. Then have the hunting carriage made ready. You'll drive me, in civilian clothes, no livery! May I warn you, your majesty, my civilian clothes are somewhat out of fashion. It doesn't matter. And you must ask no questions about this trip, I command it. Do you hear? None whatsoever. That way! Forgive me, your majesty, but windsor is this way. But this is the way to Dover. We're going to Paris. To Paris? George, I ordered you to ask no questions on this journey. Yes, your majesty. To Paris. - Forgive me, your majesty, may I ask? - Yes. But first tell me, how does a young lady know when to marry? When she finds a man who... When she suddenly feels that... Your majesty, every young lady will know herself. Only she doesn't always know which is the right one. Precisely. And that's why one needs... How can I put it? Something to compare against. I don't have that. But when I arrive in Paris, I'll take a good look at all the young men there. Your majesty! I won't have another opportunity like this. Paris is the city of love. - Who told you that? - Lord Melbourne. That's just like him. Your highness, I have just discovered that the queen has gone to windsor. To windsor? So late? Her majesty will barely be able to get back for her birthday celebrations. Extraordinary. - It's lovely here. - So romantic. Forgive me, your majesty. George, do you think this storm will stop? Your majesty, I don't dare ask if... We cannot consider traveling any further today. Ask if we can stay here tonight. Your majesty, you cannot stay in this vulgar fishermen's tavern surrounded by sailors... Ask, and stop calling me “your majesty”! No one must know who we are. The baroness is my aunt, got it? - The baroness is your majesty's aunt... - George! Bless my soul! George! What? I'm to marry the queen of england? That's why you brought me here in this beastly weather? This is the pleasure trip I've been promised for so long? Professor, I didn't expect this from you, of all people. Your highness, I wasn't supposed to tell you the purpose of the trip. Because you knew very well I would never have come! I've always been not only your tutor, but your friend, too. Indeed. The country's diplomats believe this marriage will be beneficial for all of Europe. If these diplomats are not able to benefit their own countries in any other way, - they should... - Your highness. Don't worry, I have nothing to say. I can only think what you wish to say! Which of you occupies this room? I do, if it's all the same to you. - It's not all the same to me. - Really? It's really the warmest room in this inn. That's right. And you gentlemen must be so kind as to vacate the room immediately. I've already discussed it all with the innkeeper. I see. I couldn't care less what you've already discussed with the innkeeper. I will not vacate this room. I must ask you, all the same... Please allow me to inform you that nothing will induce me to leave this room. Then unfortunately I have to tell you... Sir, the most you can do is wish us a happy easter, and next year at that. Your bag. Gloves. - I think he's lying! - Yes. Come in. Put everything down. I'll unpack myself. - May I ask where you are, your majesty? - Here, on the fireplace. - Good lord. - Are you feeling this cold, too? Yes, forgive me, your majesty. I wanted to find a warmer room for your majesty, but unfortunately I was unable to. Perhaps it's warmer in the dining room. Your majesty will be disappointed with the dining room. It's a smoky cave full of impossible people. George, don't be so genteel. Now put the bag down, please. And order something to eat. Yes, your majesty. And some wood for the fire! George! You, the fire is going out, bring me some wood. - What do you want me to do? - Bring wood. Right away, madam. Who is it? I've brought the wood. Put some on the fire, please. On the fire? There's nothing but embers left, you'll have to make a fire. Then make one. Make one? Fine. Do you have to make so much noise? I cannot chop wood silently. - What are you doing? - Making a fire. But that's far too much wood. Too much? Then I'll take some off. - Take it all off. - All of it? All of it. All of it. - First, you put paper in. - Really? - Let me go there a moment. - There you go. You see, this is how you do it. - So much paper? - Too much? Yes. We can take some off. All of it. - All of it? - Yes, all of it. All of it, all of it! And now a piece of paper, a piece of wood. A piece of paper, a piece of wood. Paper... Wood. Paper, wood... It's burning! It's actually burning. How did we do that? My paper. You don't appear to have made a fire before. No, I haven't. Normally the servant does it. What are you then? I'm a German student. I arrived by boat this evening. - You're a guest? - Yes. And you came into my room? - Forgive me, you asked me to make a fire. - Please leave immediately. Very well. - But... - Out! Forgive me. What do you want now? I wanted... - I wanted to take the basket. - Then take it. Yes. I mean, I'll fetch it later. Excuse me. - Tell me... - Yes? Was prince Albert of saxe-coburg on the boat that brought you from Germany? How did you know the prince was coming to england? I just heard... - So, was he on the boat? - Yes. I see. What does he look like? He seemed like a nice fellow, about this tall. He was planning to attend queen Victoria's birthday celebrations, was he not? Yes, he was planning to. That was the plan. The plan was for him to marry queen Victoria, too, - but that won't happen. - And why not? Firstly, he's not interested in marriage, and secondly... - How do you know all of this for certain? - I don't know for certain, but as prince consort he'd have to run around after her. No, he won't do that. No, no. Anyway, apparently the queen is a little stopper. - Stopper? - Yes. - What is that? - Stopper. Stopper. - That's a stopper. - She's a cork? Yes, a stopper. But this is a big stopper. And the queen is apparently a much, much smaller stopper. You're a little stopper, too, but a lovely little stopper. Out! Again? Forgive me, I'm going now. Stopper! This one is better. I'm curious. - Of course, I drink this myself. - Yes? You can go on drinking it yourself. Bring me a different one. - The gentleman's seated over there. - Thank you. I've kept you waiting so long, professor. I hope you're not cross with me. No, your highness. But what's the matter? You're suddenly in such good spirits! Yes, I've been working. - What, working? - Yes, I've chopped wood and made a fire. Chopped wood and made a fire? For a shivering young lady. I introduced myself to her as a German student. I see! And did you spark a fire? Yes. I see. The wood, of course. Of course, the wood. Where's the table for her maj... I mean my maj... my mistress? Here's the table. - Here. - Thank you. Just a moment. - Do you not have another table? - No, I'm afraid not. - There are no serviettes, either. - Here. I hope no one recognizes you, your majesty. Don't worry, I'm not that popular yet. The queen! Play your queen! - I thought the man had... - Yes, never mind. Where is our table? Over there. - Where shall we sit, then? - Up here. How do you know this man? He was in my room. - What? - By mistake. - And did you not throw him out? - Of course. But he came back in. - "M speechless. - So was I. He is handsome, is he not? I mean, as something to compare by? - Here you go. - I had George order this. How lovely. We shall not be able to keep up our disguise much longer. - I have no more money with me. - Then George will have to give us some. - He has none either. - He doesn't? - Would you ladies like anything to drink? - Yes. I mean, no. Perhaps we don't need anything. May I treat you ladies to a glass of wine? No, thank you, that's out of the question. That may be difficult and lonely, madam. We'll be drinking a toast with these people in celebration of their queen's birthday tomorrow. That would be difficult and lonely. May I introduce you? Professor landmann, my tutor. My aunt. My niece is only allowed one glass. Of course, one after the other. I et us drink to the queen. May she flourish and prosper. Long live queen Victoria! Long live the queen! Long live the queen! I have an idea. Get your violins! What is that man playing? - It"s a waltz. - A waltz? Yes. That's what the new dances are called this year. He was on the same boat to england as I was. - He's a composer? - Yes, a fellow countryman of mine. His name is Johann Strauss and he was invited to the birthday celebrations of queen Victoria to play his latest waltzes, to add a little spark to this sophisticated english society. I see. - Did you know about this, aunt? - No idea. But it's probably a surprise from lord Melbourne, for the queen. Probably. I'm delighted! I mean, I'm pleased that this lord Melbourne is so kind to his queen. - Would you like to dance? - I have no idea how to dance to this. - May I show you? - With pleasure. But your maj... my child. You cannot dance here! Why not? One can do anything on the queen's birthday. Of course! A lovely way to spend the evening! Come closer, please. - Closer still. - So close? Yes, and now lay your hand on my shoulder. - I should what? - Lay your hand on my shoulder. Not so stiff. The other one. Put it very gently on my neck. You see, that is the lovely thing about this dance. Now, turn slowly and count softly with me. One, two, three, one, two, three. More flexible. Lighter. That's it. Wonderful! Bravo! It is an immodest dance. Is it? Well, yes. - Would you like to try it, too? - Me? Yes. Come now. Come a little closer. Closer still. Yes. Not so close, I do need a little space. Count along very gently. One, two, three, one, two, three. There you go. Oh, my foot! I'm so sorry! - What do you think of this dance? - Delightful! What, the queen has gone? Yes, to windsor this afternoon. Apparently for some time. - Why do you say that? - Her majesty has taken several cases. Extraordinary! I must say, for the first time in my life, I'm speechless. Something has to be done, we must arrange something. We cannot put out a wanted poster for her majesty. Lord Melbourne, why haven't you canceled the dinner? Because I think it is difficult to cancel a preliminary birthday celebration on the birthday evening. He's right. What will grand Duke Alexander say? How can I tell the prince of orange? - Embarrassing. - Very embarrassing. - It will bring disgrace throughout Europe. - Yes, but quite unforeseen. - It is tiring! - Yes, but beautiful. Yes, beautiful. - Here, my dear. - Thank you. Wonderful. Move aside. Move aside. How did you get up here? “With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls, for stony limits cannot hold love out, and what love can do that dares love attempt.” Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare. I know, but don't think you can talk like that simply because I accepted your offer of wine. Forgive me. - Don't fall! - I won't, you're holding me. “Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, that tips with silver all these...” Quiet! I cannot hold you until you've finished quoting Romeo! I'm still on act two, but very well, I'll skip a few scenes. “One kiss, and I'll descend...” Don't you dare! Tell me, how long are you staying in Dover? Until tomorrow morning, and then I travel to Paris. - Shall I come with you? - It's impossible. - I will! - No! Please, you have to go. “Love, dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!” We'll meet again. The last part's by me. Your majesty! Out in the cold night air on the balcony! You'll catch cold. “0 gentle Romeo, if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.” Yes! What was that? Shakespeare! Act two, scene two. But your majesty, you feel hot! That must be from waltzing. And I had a little bit to drink, too. Me too. I had five glasses of wine! Yes, and from somebody whose name we don't even know. Baroness, it would be nice not to be queen sometimes. Your majesty... Certainly. We must be getting to bed. We'll have a lot to do in the morning. If only I knew how we might leave without paying. We owe four pounds already. Indeed, I want to know how we can get to Paris without any money, too. So do I. Not dry. But we can discuss all of that tomorrow. First, let's sleep. And if your majesty needs anything, just knock on the wall and I'll come straightaway. - Good night, sleep well. - Good night, thank you. My dear professor, please don't trouble yourself. If I hadn't met this girl, perhaps you'd still have managed to drag me to London, but now, all hope of that is lost. But your highness, consider. - Do you remember Heidelberg? - Yes, that was... You fell head over heels in love then, too. - That was completely different, professor. - How so? I shall marry this girl, even if it is the worst mismatch. Professor, our boat sails for France at 11:00 tomorrow. Be there on time, or you'll be staying in england on your own. That won't be easy. Who is it? It is I, miss. What do you want? Young lady, I must speak with you at once. No, not now. Young lady, I'd never dare barge into your room if I hadn't been forced to by matters of great importance. Please leave my room immediately. Please, I am no diplomat, so I shall get straight to the heart of the matter. I do not know the details of your financial circumstances, but I assume they are not particularly rosy. I will offer you 30 pounds, 30 pounds, if you and your aunt leave Dover at once. Tell me, have you also had too much to drink? Yes, definitely. Nevertheless, I'm completely serious. Please, by leaving Dover, you'll be fulfilling a grand, one might even say, a patriotic duty to your country. - How so? - I shall explain, but please keep this to yourself. The young man with whom I'm traveling is not a German student, but rather... A German prince. Yes, he's prince Albert of saxe-coburg. - That's prince Albert? - Yes. No! Yes. And tomorrow he's to be engaged to the young queen Victoria. - You don't say. - Can you imagine? And instead of traveling to London, he wants to go to Paris with you. It's impossible, nonsense. You can see that, can't you? Yes. Then are you prepared to disappear from the scene immediately? - At once. - That's very kind of you. But, if I disappear, do you think he'll definitely travel to London tomorrow? - He must! - Right, he must. Of course! He must! Please, would you like the money? Yes, of course, otherwise I cannot disappear. - I mean, leave. - Of course. But four pounds will be enough. Four will be enough? Very well. Four pounds. One, two, three, four... and five. Four pounds! - One pound for your aunt. - Well, now. - Young lady, I'm very happy. - So am I. Forgive me for disturbing you. Your majesty, what's happened? Baroness, get dressed quickly, we're going back to London. - When? - Now, at once. - But we cannot pay the bill. - We can, look, here. Your majesty, where did you get this money? That's my secret, and this is for you. - For me? - Yes, for my aunt. Your aunt? And tomorrow, at my birthday celebrations, I shall be engaged. - With whom? - With prince Albert of saxe-coburg. Your majesty, first sleep off the alcohol. I'll need to be about this tall. But I'll wear my crown, it makes me look taller. Or high heels? Or my hair styled high? But your majesty, you're not small at all. Don't you think? Actually, you're right. I'm average height. Yes. But I am small. Wait, what am I? A stopper, a tiny little stopper. A lovely little stopper. Who said that? He did. But he's much more handsome than I am. Much, much more handsome. “Who? - He is! Say, that's the young lady from Dover! Of course! My dear Victoria, this is the prince of orange. He traveled on the stormy seas to wish you a happy birthday in person. I'm pleased to meet you. You're very welcome here in england. Your majesty, it's an honor to be able to celebrate your birthday here with you. I hope you enjoy your time here in england. I'm certain I shall, your majesty. My dear Victoria, this is grand Duke Alexander. I'm pleased to meet you. You're very welcome here in england. My father sends his wishes. He's sorry that he's unable to accept your majesty's invitation himself. I'm sorry as well, and I hope that your stay here will strengthen the bonds between our two nations. Where's the young man from coburg? The devil only knows what's become of him. My dear prince, I'm positive this evening will decide not only the fate of our two houses, but that of Europe as well. I do not know how, but that would make me very happy. Your majesty, may I ask which suitor your majesty has chosen? No, it's a surprise. Your majesty, I like surprises very much, but in this case, in the state's interest, I'd ask you to tell me... Magnificent weather today, isn't it? Attention! We're too late again, of course. The queen's already received her guests. It doesn't matter. We'll only be staying an hour anyway. Professor! What is it? Look there! That's the qu...? That's the queen! Stay here. - I wish the ground would swallow me up. - So do I. Do you have any idea what I said to this girl? Me too. I offered her 30 pounds to disappear. I called her a stopper. And I said the prince had no intention of marrying her. I must make amends at once. Tell me, professor. Can I go straight over and tell her I'd be delighted to marry her? For heaven's sake, your highness, that's impossible! You mustn't forget protocol. Besides, you have no idea whether the queen is prepared to marry you. You're right. But what shall I say to her? Nothing. Keep quiet. His royal highness, prince Albert of saxe-coburg. Prince Albert, I'm pleased to welcome you to my country. Your majesty, forgive me for being so late in wishing you a happy birthday. I had a stormy crossing and had to rest in Dover. Have you just arrived in London? Yes, your majesty. Then you must not have seen much of the city. No, your majesty. But what I've seen so far has surprised me greatly. I can imagine. We have a new conductor here from Vienna, Mr. Johann Strauss. His music is wonderful, especially these new dances, called waltzes. Have you heard of them? Yes, your majesty. And do you know how to waltz? Indeed, your majesty. Really? Then let us dance. With pleasure, your majesty. So you're professor landmann? - I'm pleased to meet you. - Likewise. May I ask, with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking? My name is Melbourne. You are lord Melbourne! Very nice, tremendous! What do you think? We did this! Excellent. Back in Vienna, we'd say “smashing”! What's that? Smash... smashing. You do not seem overjoyed to see me again. I am, your majesty. I am delighted. But wouldn't you rather be going to Paris with the young lady you met in Dover than dancing with the queen here? Your majesty, the young lady in Dover no longer exists. And I kindly ask that you forget everything I said to her. There's no need for you to ask me that. I've forgotten it all already. Forgive me, I think your majesty has misunderstood me. No, I understand you very well. I think something's happened. Forgive me. - Come, baroness. - You look pale, your majesty. It's just the waltzing. Well, your advice worked splendidly. I shall retire. Excuse me. Did you see that? The prince of orange is disgruntled, the grand Duke of Russia is offended, and now it seems she's snubbed the prince of coburg. The child is going to start a world war. I quite agree, my dear sister. He doesn't love me. - Has he said that? - No, but I can tell. I'm so unhappy. Well, you have a good appetite, considering. It was completely different in Dover. He danced with me like this, so far away. Outrageous. - He"ll never ask for my hand. - No, indeed. - No? - No. No one can ask for the queen's hand in marriage. But you can give your own hand. How do I do that? I'm sure your majesty will find the right words. Me? Never. Is there not a book to teach english queens how to propose to a man? Your majesty, queen Elizabeth, who had some experience of such matters, sadly neglected to write a guide. How foolish. Lord Melbourne. - Your majesty. - Have you had breakfast? Three times, your majesty. Once with the prince of orange, once with grand Duke Alexander, and once... - And once...? - With professor landmann. I see. Please sit. The prince sends his apologies. He's gone out for a ride. He's run out on me? - No, gone out for a ride, your majesty. - I see. Here I am while he's out riding. How do you like him? Almost as much as I like your majesty. He's the most handsome man in the world. And he thinks you're the most beautiful woman in the world, your majesty. - Who told you that? - Professor landmann. He'll be here soon. - Professor landmann? - No, the prince. - He's coming here? - He asked for permission and if your majesty permits it, I've granted him permission. Lord Melbourne, you're an angel! But just look at this place! Such disarray! What will he think, a man from Germany, where everything is so orderly? And these windows haven't been cleaned in weeks! We'll have them cleaned, your majesty. - And it's cold in here. - Shall we make a fire, your majesty? Yes. Please clean the windows and make a fire at once. That's impossible, your majesty. Why? The royal footmen report to the master of the horse. They are not permitted to touch the windows. Who's in charge of the fire? The lord steward prepares the wood and the lord Chamberlain lights it. But we do not keep any firewood in the palace before September. Now I know why I'm always so cold. Please be so kind as to determine how her majesty's wishes might be satisfied, if at all possible. I shall inquire. See how much power I have! I can't even have the windows cleaned without convening parliament. Well? The internal windows are the responsibility of the master of the household, and the external windows... Presumably the exterior ministry. No. The royal forestry administration. This is getting ridiculous! Please clear the table, quickly. Your majesty, I'm afraid you'll have to get engaged without clean windows. I fear you're right. But now prepare everything so that I can change my clothes quickly. The most beautiful engagement dress, your majesty. And my hair! You know. Oh, yes! That's him! See how marvelous he looks! I see the windows are not so dirty as to prevent your majesty noticing as much. He's wonderful. If your majesty will allow me, I shall withdraw. My mission is complete. Lord Melbourne, I have something for you. The highest honor I can bestow... The order of the garter. Your majesty, this distinction elevates me above all other men in your kingdom. I no longer want this power. I'm not young enough anymore. It is enough for me to know that you still have a little fondness for me. I don't want to impose it on you. I just wanted to thank you. It is I who must be thankful for my good fortune. I've had the privilege of teaching a noble, young woman to be queen. No one can imagine what pleasure it has brought me, only I. God bless you, your majesty. It's time for us to take our leave of one another. I take my leave of power, of politics and of love. Crying, your majesty? I've just bid farewell to lord Melbourne. Will you be leaving me, too? Me? No, your majesty. I'll always be by your side, if you need me. Even though someone else will be guiding you through life now. Baroness, I'm so in love. That's wonderful, your majesty. But now go and get dressed, your majesty. We cannot keep prince Albert waiting. Yes. - What kind of dress have you prepared? - The pink one. - And my hair? - Everything is there, everything. Baroness, are you as happy as I am? - Whoops! - Forgive me. I believe we've met. Your highness, if only I had known... Forget it. If only I had known! Her majesty will see you now. Please, take a seat. Did you go out for a ride this morning? Yes, through London. Through London? It is a beautiful city, isn't it? A magnificent city. Can you imagine living here? Yes, quite happily. The english are very friendly. They are, aren't they! I think they are very devoted to me. I think... I mean, if I were to marry, they'd be the same with my husband, even if he were not an englishman. Perhaps, hopefully. Not perhaps, hopefully. Definitely! You must not look around, it's such a mess here. - It's a very old palace. - A magnificent palace. Yes, but it needs reforming. Everything's in need of reform here... The conditions, the laws, the windows, everything. But I cannot do it all alone. I need a firm hand. I mean, at home. A firm hand, used to German discipline. - Do you understand? - Yes. Forgive me. Over here. Today, for example, the queen is cold, you see? The fire is cold, too, as we don't keep wood in the palace before September. - Would you like me to light a fire again? - No. I mean, what would you do if there were no firewood? Me? It's no use. There's nothing to be done! Her majesty would like a fire to be made at once. Your highness, I've already reported in detail three times that... The queen is freezing! Yes, me too, but according to the calendar... If there's no fire here in 15 minutes, then I'll really let you have it! Out! You really are a man! Of course. And if custom were to allow it, then... Well? - If custom were to allow it, then... - Yes? I think... - If custom were to allow it, then... - Then what? You have to say it first. But I'm forever beating around the bush. Albert, I love you. Will you be my wife? I'm so confused! Will you be my husband? Victoria. Are we engaged now? I think so. Then kiss me! The End -- English --
