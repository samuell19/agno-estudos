-[coughing] [spits] -Good morning, girls. Come on, girls. Here we go. MALE SPEAKER [ON RADIO]: Your early morning radio show. And now the markets from Milwaukee. Here's Jack. JACK: [ON RADIO]: Thursday the cattle market. Premium bulls were higher at 67, with a couple at 68 and 6850. MALE SPEAKER [ON RADIO]: Thank you, Jack. It's 6 o'clock in the morning. and now we move to Wednesday and our experts. FEMALE SPEAKER [ON RADIO]: Good morning. MALE SPEAKER [ON RADIO]: It is a little chilly out there this morning, eh? FEMALE SPEAKER [ON RADIO]: Yeah, it is. 34 degrees is what I've got-- MALE SPEAKER [ON RADIO]: And our weather report brought to you by Rottweilers TV, thank you for shopping. [radio playing] [phone ringing] -[sighs] MALE SPEAKER [ON RADIO]: Hello, Americans. This is Paul Heart. Recreation vehicles or an airplane. People got together to exchange information about new ways to get more enjoyment out of their travels. All of us learn from one other to be sure to have a [inaudible]. [laughs] So innovative that this little beauty has even the Japanese doing their shopping in Cleveland. [shouts] [rock music playing] -Tell me I don't know what I'm seeing. You can see for yourself. -What? -That father of yours Go up there again flirting with that neighbor lady. You can come look for yourself. You think what you want, but she can see that from over there. You better believe it. They've probably got some kind of code set up. Ha. We know her. She's flipping her fat ass every time he's around. Mmm. -You start in on stuff again, and you know what's going to happen. -I'll tell you something else. I wouldn't trust that floozy as far as I could throw her. -I brought this milk for our little kitty girl. The milk truck's coming this morning. There won't be any more until tomorrow. I don't see how you can stand listening to that stuff. You can hear it clear down to the barn? -The TV? I'm not even watching it. -No, I don't mean that. I mean the garbage she listens to. She must be half deaf. -That's not what bothers me around here. -Well, I'll tell you something else. She'll get that boy hooked into listening to that stuff, too. That's not good for him. Well, is it? I can hear it all the way from the barn. I think it would drive you crazy. -Oh, buddy. Come on. Oh, god. Oh, damn. I don't know what she's eating. -You're too damn good to her. She's been eating those goddamn rats. They've been sons of bitches lately. -Well, maybe you've got rats where you are, but I haven't seen non around here-- no siree. -Hi, Lyle. -Good morning, Fran. -Hey, you're back with a full load already? Uh, listen. Bud next door has been asking how long you're going to keep that camper parked out there. You know, it's kind of an eye sore. -I should have it going in no time. -Bud's one of these guys who likes to worry about things. -And I think you give him enough to worry about, Franny. -Who, me? Well, yeah. I give him his share. Well, it's about time. Good morning Clovis, honey. You've got a lot of work to do, young lady. -Sorry. We had a sick cow. -Sick cow or no sick cow, it's high time you came to work on time for once. I hope you washed your hair after being in that barn. -Snuff. Did you find out what time you were born? -Hell, I think everyone's forgotten by now. [laughs] -I've been telling Fran she ought to let you do her horoscope chart. -Oh, I don't believe in that stuff. Heaven's sake. It's superstition. That's what it is. It reminds of that Ouija Board. -Oh, i think it's pretty neat stuff. -Ah. It gives me the creeps. I don't suppose my stars would line up to make sense anyway, no matter how you look at 'em. -Yeah. You could say that again, Fran. You and a lot of the people around here. -Watch your tongue, young lady. -You spent all that time in there and you're still not dressed? You're not a baby anymore, you know? -Well, when she catches a cold, Clovey, we'll just get a big syringe in from the barn and we'll give her a shot of penicillin. Hmm? We'll give her a great big shot of penicillin, eh? -Ah! [laughs] -Stop it, now. Let him eat supper. I think you'd be, uh, worn out climbing on top of that silo every day. -What? Just trying to knock a few pigeon's nests down it. -It must be awfully interesting for you stay up there for so long. -I wasn't up there that long. -25 minutes this time, according to that clock. I'm not blind. -Do I have to listen to this every night? -All I said was-- -I would think you would have better things to do. -All I said was-- -No, god damn it, I know what you said, all right. -Oh. Go and waste all your food. That's going to prove a lot. -Garbage. I wouldn't feed it to a goddamn dog. I'm a farmer my whole life, and I gotta eat this shit? -Will you just stop it? -It's my own goddamn house. I'll say what I want. You hear me? -Yeah, well you're not the only one living here, you know? -You don't like it? You know what you can do about it, don't you? -Let's just drop it. -You can get the hell out. That's what you can do. -No. Stop it. Stop it. I'm sorry I said anything. Let's just change the subject. Come on, Clovis. Come on. -You can follow that good-for-nothing brother of yours into the Army or Navy or wherever the hell he is. -[SINGING] La, la, la, la, la. La, la, la. -You've been leeching off home long enough? -Leeching? I'm not leeching. Pay me the money you owe me and I'll go. -Pay you. Pay you. Pay you. -You know we can't pay you right now. Why even bring it up? -[ANGRILY] Yeah, right. -Come on, Clovis. Help me sing, huh? [SINGING] La, la, la, la, la, la. -Oh, be quiet, would you? -Will you two then-- I don't know why you have to talk to her that way. -What'd I say? You shoot off your mouth whenever it suits you. You would certainly have been interesting for you to sit up there for so long. My God, if I wanted to flirt with the neighbor's wife, I wouldn't be passing notes back and forth like a damn schoolkid. But that's what you think, isn't it? You sit here at the window spying on me. -I'm not spying. -I'd think you have better things to do. My God. Don't you have enough to do? Is that it? You don't have enough to do. -All I said was I don't know what you're looking at from the top of the silo-- taking pictures. It's suspicious. -Suspicious. Suspicious! My God. If you don't have enough to do, I can sure as hell find you something to do. By god, I'm going to give you something to do. -He's a dick. -Oh, well, you're setting a good example, now. I didn't know you smoked too. -Yeah. You two drive me to smoke. -Well, I don't know what he's up to out there. Ugh. Oh, he's got the loader tractor going. -Clovis, why don't you go outside and see if he needs your help. I don't know why you couldn't just keep quiet. He worked hard all day. -Me quiet? You started it. God. You are so two-faced. -Two-faced? Listen here, young lady. You can just give me a little more credit. I told him just the other day that he was lucky that you were still at home, helping out. We plan to pay you for helping us. -Yeah. Just like you were going to pay Tommy? -If Jack had just treated Tommy a little bit better, he might still be here farming with us instead of halfway across the world. -I bet Tommy's a lot happier now than when he was here. -I'll bet you anything Tommy regrets his decision. Well, that's a fact. If you go and leave now, you know who's going to get stuck with all the work? It's going to be up to that boy. You better believe it. -He's digging a hole. -A hole? -Mhm. -I'll give you something to do, all right. -Are you crazy? -You're going to fill that hole up with that shovel. Then we'll see how much time you've got left to spy on me. RANDI: What am I supposed to do? ARLENE: You can go down there and apologize. That's what you can do. RANDI: Why should I have to go down there? ARLENE: Well, I can't talk to him. Then just let him drive off a cliff and kill himself. That's what's going to happen, you know? -Put some clothes on. You're going to drive the truck back. -Dad. -What are you doing here? -Dad, let's go. I'm sorry. -I'm sorry, Dad. -Come on, Dad. Let's go. Mom's waiting. -Let her wait. -[explosion sound effect] -Let's go, Clovis. We're running late. -Well, well, well. Is our little sleepy-head Randi? -Ahh. Knock it off. -[laughs] Excuse me. Pew. Ah. I smell that barn of yours. -Yeah. You don't smell so great yourself. -She just told me this morning what happened to her husband. -She drove the poor bird crazy. -So you have trouble getting up in the morning too? -Oh. I get up way before I come to this hole. I have to milk those cows 365 and one fucking quarter days a year. -Dad says she sleeps until the sun shines up her ass. -Clovis! -[laughs] -You ever had your horoscope chart read? -Nope. -That's Fran's. -What star from hell was she born under? -I can do yours if, uh, if you give me the exact time and date you were born. -Well, I'd have to ask my mom about the exact time. Do people pay you for these? -Donations. -What, are you a church or something? -I could do yours for free. -So these things can really tell something about what's going to happen to you? -It's like an emotional weather report. I should get going. I have a couple of more stops to make. The Olsons are milking three times a day. You want to ride with me, sport? -Please? -Don't be late. Mom and Dad will be wondering what happened to you. Oh. Don't forget to ask your mom about the time. -[laughs] Oh. Yeah. OK. Bye. -What's the matter? You don't like this music? -Oh, it's OK. Dad plays country in the barn. [SINGING] Ooh, darlin', you broke my heart when I broke my back. Ooh, darlin', how I miss you. -[laughs] -If you dig a hole deep enough, will you get to China? -That's what they say. -Dad dug a big hole in the yard. -Is he trying to get to China? -It's for mom. -Maybe he's going to plant her something. -I don't know. -You got any other brothers and sisters? -No. Well, there's Tommy, but he doesn't live with us anymore. Why is that? -I don't know. He sent me this. [airplane sound effect] -See that? I used to tell you they were rabbits running through the corn. When it would blow like that, you'd watch that for hours through the kitchen window. Remember that? -I'd just love to go-- go on one of these things. -Fran's getting on my case about it being parked out here. -Did you know that whales were land animals that returned to the ocean? Did you know that baby whales have a nose in front, like a dog, and then right before it's born, it moves to the top of their head, like a-- like, right here, and then it makes that sprout that the spew water out of. [laughs] -No, I did not know that. -It's true. My brother's in the Navy. That's what I'm thinking about. -You? Join the Navy? -Fuck you! What's wrong with that? They'd take me. -You're too free-spirited for that. -You think so? Well-- well, I haven't joined yet. [clears throat] I'm-- I'm working at home for now, and I'm getting paid really good. I'm working here, too. I'm saving a lot of money. See, I have to take care of Clovis, too. He doesn't really have anyone else to influence him, and stuff, you know. Don't you miss your daughter? -Sure I do. -It's 10:30 already. She still hasn't come home. I don't know what's taken her. I hope she didn't run off the road somewhere. Can you do this for me? My hands are so crippled up I can't even open it. [sighs] I suppose it's going to be clouded up by morning. Hmm. [sighs] Crazy weather. -You sure this is OK with your mom and dad? -Yeah. I'm sure. -You asked them and they said it was OK that I parked it up there? -Yes. My dad really likes you. He even said that you're the best milkman we ever had. -Yeah, right. Let's go. -Oh, shit. See I told you you would see everything. Oh, man. Stop. Come on. -Get out of there. For god's sake. [shouts] -Give me that shovel, Arlene. -Come on, Mom. Give him the shovel. You're going to get sick. -I'm not going to have people talking-- -Come out of there. Give me that shovel, Arlene. -Mom-- give him the shovel. -Clovis, go get a raincoat from the house. Get out of there, for God's sake. This is crazy. -[shouts] Stupid hoe! -For God's sake. This is crazy. -Mom. -Get out. Get out, dammit. -You think you can humiliate me with this. Climbing that silo. I know what you're looking at up there. -Thank you. You can park that thing anywhere you want. Just don't get stuck. And keep this quiet. -Hi. -Hi. I thought I'd see you down at the Grill this morning. -Oh, I had to stay home again today and help with something. -Oh. -A stupid cow died. -Really? -So how long do you plan on keeping this job, anyway? -This job right here? -Well, do you have another job? [laughs] -I read astrology charts. -Oh yeah. Are you really going to do mine? -Sure. Like I told you, I need the exact time you were born. This stuff here? Just between you and me, I don't have a very good track record when it comes to sticking out a job. -So you don't plan on staying around that long? -I didn't say that. It's just that I-- I don't know. -Do you know where you're going to go from here? He's stuck out there. -Did you see a red sticker for this new sweepstakes entry? They say right here there's supposed to be a red instant winner's sticker. -Oh. I forgot to give you these. -Oh. Oh, good. Good. You know, I am, uh, tempted not even to send this one in this year. They never tell you who wins. It's probably just a hoax. -No. -Oh, stop it. Now you can all make fun of me. As soon as I give up, that'll be my lucky day. We can't give up hope, you know. Where would we be then? -Lyle's pulling him out with his truck. -Can use the money as well as the next guy. Maybe everyone would be a little happier around here, digging holes in the middle of the yard. Is he crazy? Who in their right mind would do a thing like that? -Lyle's almost got him out. -Yeah, sure. And he'll leave a little bigger hole than he dug in the first place, I'm telling you. You better believe it. [sighs] That Lyle seems like a nice man. Do you think he has any interest in farming? -Do you remember what time I was born? -Uh, what time you were born? Well, why do you want to know that? -Lyle's going to do my horoscope. -Horoscope? Well, that's neat. He believes in that. Well, let's see. I remember it was early morning. And I'd been up all night with labor pains. It must have been 5:00 or 6 o'clock. I'd have to check with the hospital. You know, you had your umbilical cord wrapped around your neck three times. Heh. The doctor was scared when he saw that. I didn't know, of course. I was so drugged up. I never had much trouble with you after that. You-- you know, Tommy took care of you. You were always by his side. Oh, you know? I remember Dad taking you out to the barn, and he'd put you up on that old gray cow we used to have. The kids used to call her Popsicle. -[laughs] -I don't know why you called her Popsicle. Do you remember her? And she could wiggle her skin up and down her back. Oh, I'd go out there, and he'd have you up on that cow, walking up and down the barn aisle, every light on and the radio blaring, full volume. I tell you. It was like a circus. I was afraid you were going to fall off. -I remember touching the lights on the top of the ceiling when we were on the cow. -You could have been electrocuted. Now, I tell you, I worried plenty raising you kids. [laughs] Oh, well you ought to remember when I brought Clovis home from the hospital, you wouldn't hardly let anyone touch him. You was just used to parading around the house with him in your arms saying, isn't he cute? Mmm. Isn't he cute? All day long. [bell rings] Ah, I don't know if these things do any good or not. Sometimes I think I just feel worse. -Why don't you go see a better doctor? -A better doctor. What's he going to do? I'd be fine if it weren't for all this commotion. I just want everybody to be happy. -Happy. Oh, yeah, we're all really happy-- one happy family. -Yeah. Well, now, they, uh, have things on TV and in the newspapers that inform people a little bit more. If Jack would have read some of those things on raising families, we might still have Tommy here to farm with this. -And you think if you-- if you-- if you buy enough of these stupid lotteries we'll get rich and everything will be different? -Listen. We can't give up hope. Where would we be then? Maybe I'll get lucky someday. -You don't just get lucky and everything changes. God, you don't understand anything except for your stupid jackpot and your fucking statues. -Oh! Stop that. Stop that. Oh. Oh, what am I supposed to do? -Wait. Let me do it. Does my hair still smell like the barn? -Nope. -Are you sure? I think I can still smell it. -It smells like you. -Great. If the world only knew that my chaperone, hairstylist, chauffeur was a 10-year-old boy. What? What is it? -Be still. -Come on. We've got to go. He's going to leave without us. -No he won't. -[coughing] You get me so worked up. I'm just not myself anymore. You had no right digging that hole. That was cruel. Well. I guess it can just sit out there staring at us, like a big gaping mouth. Oh, I don't know why it's always got to be like this. [clears throat] -We're going. -Ah. Well, don't be late. You know how the mornings are for you getting out of bed. I'm not going to be out there tomorrow to help out. -Clovis will sleep in my room tonight. He can get me up in the morning. -You know, I would think that you'd just dress a little nicer if you were planning on dancing, huh? Come on. Give me a kiss. Kiss. You have fun. -This place is pretty wild. My mom has candles like these. I used to stare at them for hours while she said her prayers. -What did she pray for? -Oh, I don't know. I guess things people usually pray for-- her kids, her marriage, sick cows, rain, crops. Her eyes looked so sad. What's your mother like? -Mine? Oh, I don't know. Let's see. My dad left when we were kids. She missed him-- that much I remember. -Why'd he leave? -He didn't believe in families. He said they were unhealthy institutions of domination, or some bullshit. He thought kids should have more freedom. -He probably thought he should have more freedom. -Yeah. That's more like it. In the end, I think I kind of respected him for all that freedom. Maybe it was just as well I didn't have an old man to fuck me up, huh? [laughs] -Mmm. My dad used to beat my brother Tommy up all the time. He used to try running away, and then my dad would promise him things to get him to come back. And then everything would start all over again. You probably wonder why I'm still here. You probably think I'm some sort of stupid farm girl who doesn't have a clue. I plan on leaving, just not right now. -I know No place where you can ride dolphins, near where I used to live. My daughter is crazy about dolphins. In fact, let me show you what I got for her birthday. [toy squeaking] -Where are your wife and daughter? -Back East, with my wife. I mean, my daughter is with my wife. I haven't seen them for a year and four months. -You miss 'em, don't you? Where'd you go? Those guys from John's Valley came down to the Grill again tonight. Is Mom sleepin'? -Where you been? -What? -I said, where have you been. -At the Grill. Where do you think? -You drove in the yard two hours ago. Where have you been since then? -Talking with Lyle. -You want to know something? He can drive that piece of junk right down the road anytime he wants to. You know that, don't you? That son of a bitch hasn't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, and he never will. -Well, you're the one who said he could park it out there. -I know I said he could park it out there. That dumb thing I did. -Did Mom take her medication? -How should I know? -She doesn't sleep when she doesn't take it. She should see a doctor. -What are you dressed like that for? You look like a damn slut. -You're Drunk. -I heard some things about you. -Yeah. I'm sure you'd be the first one to believe what you hear, too. You always have. -What? I'm still the boss around here. JACK [VOICEOVER]: If you don't like it, you know what you can do about it, don't you? You can get the hell out. That's what you can do. -Oh. I always wanted to make myself really, really small and ride away in one of these. -Mmm. I always think of that spaceship that they sent up-- you know, with the greetings from around the world in different languages. -Ah. Imagine how confusing that'll be when someone or something finds it in a zillion years. -Why is that? -Well, I think we went extinct because no one knew how to talk to one another. -Well, I think it's like a prayer. [laughter] Why don't you come with me? I'll fix this thing, and we'll go traveling anywhere you want. You said you wanted to go to the ocean. -Yeah. But, um-- -But what? Just up and disappear. -[laughs] Oh, little guy. Oh. Hey, come on. Oh, good. I have an itch in my back. Crazy. There's straw down there or hay or something. -Let me see. -He's-- he's growing an inch a day. -Yeah. He's getting big. -I'm going to give you this calf. -Why? -Well, if you're going to take over the farm someday. -I came to ask if Lyle can help with chores. He's never even milked a cow before. -Sure. Yeah. You know what? I've got some things to do. You can go ahead and get started without me. -Oh. -Well, I've got to show you how to do this. -Like that? -[laughs] -Ah, help! -Get back here. Get back here! Hey! Hey! Get back here! -Ah! Stop it. You're hurting me. Stop it. -All the milk's been going down the drain because of all of your goddamn daydreaming! -Fuck you, you bastard! Stop it! Leave him alone! -What are you looking at? Get the fuck out. -Hey. Wait a minute! -[coughing] -Where's Randi? -She didn't come home last night. -What? She didn't come home? -Dammit. -Oh! -Move over. Move over. Come on! Move over! -Ow! -Come here, you son of a bitch! God damn you. Son of a bitch. God damn it. That's the last time you're going to get me, son of a bitch. God damn it. [groaning] God damn it, son of a bitch! -I just stopped to get some things. -I'm sorry. It's my fault. -It wasn't your fault. Look. I'm not mad at you, toe head. Honest. -Are those coveralls Lyle's? -Yeah. They're pretty cool, aren't they? -Yeah. -Where you planning on going? Need any blankets? You can have the, uh, blue one off my bed. -Did she check to see if there's enough gas in the car? -She's right there. Ask her yourself. -I'm not taking the car. Can I have the money you owe me for working here, please? -The money we owe you. We just don't have it. -You promised. -That boy cleaned the whole house hoping that you'd come home. -He stood by the window waiting for you to come home all night. You can't leave us like this. -Morning. Did Father Walter tell your mom and dad when he was going to come over tomorrow to do the blessing? We're going to have plenty of food-- that's for sure. I made three hot dishes. Clovis is going to love that. Lyle quit his job. Did you know? Yeah. He sat up here all night until I kicked him out. He said you and he are going off together. -Do you know if he's gone? -I haven't seen him so far this morning. Come here. You know, after Roger died, I felt so guilty and responsible. There was this one guy that I could have married after it was all over. It was my own stupid fault-- my godson's father. Oh, he was a handsome dish. I loved him, believe me. -Why didn't you marry him? -Well, I kept asking myself-- how can I be a godmother and a stepmother all at the same time? Isn't that incredible? So here I sit. Sometimes we can't see the forest for the trees. -[sighs] Oh. I'll be damned. They finally got that eye sore going then, huh? -So what's up? -Nothing. -What do you mean nothing? -I can't leave right now. We have problems at home and I have to stay and help out. Sorry. -Sorry? Look. I just quit my job. I burned my bridges for you. -Don't give me that, like you need any help burning your bridges. -Oh, what the hell is that supposed to mean, huh? Maybe you should burn some and stop feeling sorry for yourself. -Fuck you! -Just cause you think you can-- you can run away every time you can't handle it anymore. -Yeah right. -Why aren't you with your wife and daughter? -That is none of your business. -Yeah. It's because you're afraid, just like your old man. -Fuck you. -Yeah, fuck you too! This isn't any of your goddamn business either. I don't give a flying fuck about what's going to happen to me. I'm my own self. Just leave me alone. CLOVIS [VOICEOVER]: Daddy. Daddy. JACK [VOICEOVER]: You can follow that good-for-nothing brother of yours into the Army or Navy or wherever the hell he is. Oh. God-- [glass breaking] CLOVIS [VOICEOVER]: [crying] JACK [VOICEOVER]: You can get the hell out-- that's what you can do. [gunshot] -Look. -Cool. -No. You can have it. -Thanks. Hey Clovis, do you ever think about what you want to be when you grow up? How would it be if I left you for a while? -Where would you go? -To the ocean. Maybe get a job on a fishing boat or something. See, I eventually want to get a really good job working with whales-- maybe at a marine biology place or something. And then I could come back here and-- and get you. And then you come live with me. How would that be? -A farmer. -[laughs] What about a farmer? -I think I'll be a farmer when I grow up. Wait. -You'll miss me? [sighs] -Ahh! [echoing] Ahh! -I-- I can't do it. [gunshot] -Have you ever been to the ocean? Have you ever seen a whale? They're a lot like cows, you know. They even call them cows and calves. Did you know that? I've always felt that I could make up for something that I did. It isn't my fault Tommy left. You chased him away. He wanted to be a farmer, but you chased him away. -Everything was sick. Everything. Everything's more and more sick. -Every time I tried to leave, you make promises to make me stay. I feel so stupid. What have I been thinking? I was afraid of you. Suddenly I feel so stupid. It's just like when I stopped being afraid of the dark. You're just an old man. That's all. -We are gathered here today for a special blessing-- a blessing for our land and the fruits of your labor. Let us give thanks. Lord, yours are the praises-- the glory, the honor, and blessing be to all your creatures. -Come on. Get up. Come on, girls. Get out of there. Come on. Get out of there! Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Come on. Ya! Ya, ya! Hya! -Praise and blessing to the wind and air and every kind of weather, with which comes sustenance for those creatures. JACK: Ah. Ya! Ya! Ya. Ya! Come on. Ha Go. Come on. Ya. -Lord make us instruments of your peace. Where there is hatred, let us so love. Where there is injury, harden. Where there is doubt, faith. -[shouts] [shouts] [shouts] -Where there is despair, hope. Where there is sadness, joy. Grant that we may not so much seek to be consoled as to console. To be understood, as to understand. To be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive, and pardoning that we are pardoned. -Dad? Dad? [gunshot] [gunshot] MALE SPEAKER: Take it easy. FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh my god. [gunshot] -Oh my god. -[shouts] They're all sick. Let them go. -Dad! Dad! [gunshot] [gunshot] -Let them go. Let them go. -Oh. MALE SPEAKER: Over there. Over there. -Oh my god. [gunshot] Oh my god, you're going to kill somebody. -Let them go. I've been watching them from up here. They're all sick. Let them go. [shouts] -Dad? JACK: Go! -Dad? JACK: You don't understand. Let them go. Go! Go! Go! Go! -Dad! [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [sirens] [gunshot] -I'm warning you, don't try to stop me. They're all sick. -Dad! Dad! Dad! -Jack? JACK: Don't try to stop me. I don't give a damn. Let 'em go. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Let them run. -Ugh. Ah. JACK: I'm warning you. Don't try to stop me. Let them run. [shouting] -Dad! Dad! -Hey. Everyone's looking for you. We thought something might have happened to you. My dad's driving my mom crazy with these photos. I can't believe he's been carrying those things around with him. -Nobody knows what to do. -He ain't gonna listen to anybody. -Well, maybe you can talk to him. -Talk to him. I talked to him last night. [crashing noise] -[coughing] Oh. Oh. Ah. Ah. Whew. Whew. Oh, I didn't know I still had that much strength left. What's got into you, Jack? Sometimes it's still the farm I saw when I was 20-- the farm I always dreamed about. From up here, it's all green-- fields in straight rows, trimmed, the grass around the house, a herd of cows, beautiful cows in the pasture, all facing the same direction with their heads held high, as if they were smelling something on the air. I always thought I could pass it along. Why do you think I've worked so hard all of these years? It's the only thing I ever really wanted. -Randi's leaving, Jack. You've got to stop blaming her and Tommy for all the things that have gone wrong. She's a grownup. She has to live her own life. I'll help you, Jack. I will. I, uh-- I brought you something to show you. Hmm? There's not a day that I don't thank the good Lord for that little boy. -It's that field out there. -What's he got planted in it? -Rabbits. -Sorry. -It's all over. -Hey, sport. -How big a engine they got in there? -Rebuilt 351. 153,000 miles on it. I think they'd be putting Honda engines in these things by now. -Maybe I'll be lucky sometime and win one of these. Wouldn't that be nice? You know, in a lottery or sweepstakes contest? Then we could, uh-- we could come out and visit you sometime. -Bye, Mom. -Can I use your knife? -Dad. -Bye. Be good. Don't take any wooden nickels. If you see Tommy, say hello. -OK. Here.
