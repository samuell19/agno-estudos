Your name Chanel willows, 'cause they just called you for court. You better get up and get ready, 'cause they be down here in a couple minutes. Okay. Thank you. What time is it? It's 5:30 A.M. in the morning, Princess. You can call me boss lady if you want to. - Chanel willows. - Okay. Yeah! See you later on, Princess. Me and you, baby. Dinner for two! Sexy! Pretty green eyes. Hey, keep it down in here, man. Yeah, I see you up to no good, as usual. Can't keep your damn hands off of people. Take your ass down, too. Your honor, counsel Shelly Miller for the defense. The defense would request that the court release miss willows on her own recognizance during the wait of her trial. Miss willows has never been in trouble with the law before, and she has a six-year-old daughter to look after. Your honor, counsel William a. Leone for the prosecution. I would like to add one condition to that request, your honor. And what might that condition be, Mr. Leone? A 24-hour mobile electronic monitoring surveillance system. Miss willows, you are charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, receiving stolen property and money laundering. With these charges, you are facing the maximum of 15 to 20 years. You are due back in this court one month from today. Until then, you are released and placed on house arrest. House arrest! Damn. House arrest? At least I get to leave that cold-ass hellhole. What the hell are they talking about? House arrest. We can't even go to the mall on house arrest. The judge should have just let me go. Now I gotta deal with this court shit and house arrest. I mean, I didn't do nothing anyway. Nothing but spend money. I can't even go back to me and Deandre's spot. What's up with that? I ain't got nowhere else decent to stay. So I guess I gotta go stay at mee-mah's house. Miss willows, have a seat. Miss willows, I'm officer Wanda Davis. I will be your pre-trial probation officer while you're under house arrest. That means that you are a ward of the state. Now you are afforded the opportunity to prove to the courts that you're a responsible citizen. No law-breaking, no drugs or alcohol in your system, no missing court dates and absolutely no missing curfew or drug tests. Now you are due back in court... On June 8th. And until that time, your ass belongs to me. Now you left-handed or right-handed? I'm right-handed. Okay, give me your right ankle. Hell, no. That is gonna have to go, miss thing. What is that? This is the latest in technology. It will go off if you leave a 50-foot radius perimeter that will be based around your home. If that sound goes off, this office will be immediately notified. And at that time, you will be tracked down, you will be apprehended and, miss willows, you will be taken directly to jail. - Now are we clear? - Yes, ma'am. I'm not your ma'am. I'm your officer. And do you know what that means? That means that I have the right to talk shit. I've got the right to take your ass to jail. Ouch! That's too tight. Is it? You'll get used to it. Have a good day, miss willows.

Yeah, that is correct. Okay, then she goes to the bank, she gets a certified cashiers check for the amount. Then she comes to your company with a copy of that check and places an order for delivery. Is that correct? That is correct. Then you send your delivery guy to deliver the ordered computer chips and to pick up the original cashier's check for payment. - Isn't that right? - Exactly... But then the boyfriend Deandre shows up with his thug friends, they Rob the delivery guy of the computer chips and assault him in the process. Isn't that right? Yeah, they beat him so bad, that my delivery man started bleeding from the nose. And now he's trying to sue me for a lot of money and I have no insurance. Whoa whoa whoa!

Okay, I do not need nor do I want to hear any lectures from you right now. - I got enough problems. - No, Chanel, your problem is you can't separate what you want you from what you need. Excuse me. Since when are you the expert on my wants and needs? But as usual, you a day late and a dollar short. Listen, Chanel, even though you've been a bad mother to our daughter, the only reason why I haven't taken you to court for custody is because I know how much Autumn loves you. - You crazy. - Whatever. Autumn, honey, come in the house. Mommy, I want to change my name. You want to change your name to who? I wanna change my name to Gucci. Autumn. Sign in. - Early in the morning, isn't it? - Now, miss willows, I want you to remember that I expect you to get enrolled in school or get a job soon. You can part-time for both, full-time for one or the other. Get a job or go to school. You also have the privilege of attending a religious service on sunday. And you are required to be back home by 3:00 P.M. and, miss willows, the judge is gonna be looking very closely at your progress while you're on house arrest. Do you understand? - Yes, I do. - Well, I tell you what. If you don't obey those rules, if you break those rules, you will pay for it in court, because it will affect you tremendously. So I suggest you do yourself a favor... Take care of your business. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. Okay, miss willows, get your test done. I'll see you later.

You gotta go. And when y'all gonna let my dog out of jail? Who? Deandre? Wow, I can't even believe you went there. No. Trixie! Look, your dog's in the pound, because we believe he's stolen property.

Is Chanel willows available, please? I got it, mee-mah! Hello. Hello. Miss willows, there are conditions that you must follow when you are under house arrest. Now answer this for me. What were you doing shopping at the mall when you should been looking for a job? Okay, first of all, I was not in the mall shopping. I was looking for a job. I got three applications... Gucci, Louis and dior, okay? Those was not my shopping bags. Those was my girlfriend's. You are really pushing it close. Now I want you to just call me if you get a job at any one of those stores. You are almost in violation, Chanel, so you'd better watch it. You don't want us to come over there and get you, do you? No, miss Davis. I didn't think so. - Who is it? - It's me, girl... keisha! I've been nonstop all day. I got your message telling me to come by yesterday. Just came by to make sure everything was all right. - No, everything ain't all right. - Well, what's wrong? I don't even know where to start. See what I mean? - Swah. - Is blue there? - Blue? - Yeah, 'cause you about to be real blue, - 'cause your car ain't here. - Hell, no. - My car ain't there? - Where? - In the garage. - It ain't here. I told you. I can't believe this. Deandre straight got some broad driving our shit? - - What about the rest of my stuff? I don't know, girl, but it's a mess up in here. Search warrant said they came up here and took all your stuff. And I'm scared, I'm telling you, they got all kind of forensic evidence up in here, and they left your ugly stuff on the bed. I don't understand. What's going on? Do me a favor. There's a key in the pool house under the dresser. - Right. - I taped it there. Okay. All right, I'll get the key. I'm just scared. I can't go to jail. You know what they'd do to me in jail. Okay, I'm just scared. I'm scared, though. No, I don't... Where is it at? It's not on your dresser. Fran-swah, Fran-swah, stop trippin'! It's not here. Look underneath it, okay? - No, is not in this. - Look! Keep... keep... keep looking! I think... I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm on my way, okay? - Mommy, mommy! - What, Autumn? Mommy, does the house have hands? Does the house have what? Yes, does the house have hands and arms? 'Cause... No, baby. Who been touching you? Well, how did the house arrest you? Autumn, baby, can you go to your room and I'll be in there to talk to you in a minute. - Okay. - Bye-bye, Autumn. Okay, girl, what's really going on? Tell me the business. Me and Fran-swah straight saw some trick - driving Deandre's car today. - Well, what did she look like? I didn't see her face, and now the police done raided my house and my car ain't even there. My god, I can't believe that. But you know what? The police raided my homeboy's house and took his car and started driving it around. Yep, yep, they probably doing the same thing to your shit right now. Using it in a sting operation or something. Yeah, you know what? You right, 'cause I know, Deandre would not let some ho drive around in our car. Hell, no. Ooh, I need to speak to him. And he called me up yesterday straight trippin'. Talking about I need to take the fall, 'cause all I'll get is probation and they trying to strike him out. What you think about that? Wow! You know what, Chanel? You are a good-ass woman for holding your dude down like that. Y'all are in love for real, girl. I wish I had a man like that. You know what? You just have way too much going on right now. You just need to relax for a little while. That's all. I'ma go, - and you call me if you need anything, all right? - Yeah, okay. Just get some rest. I just need some rest. Well, that's how you feel?

I should squirt you with this hose. Whoa, what you doing?! Remember, ike and Tina. He sure is a fine young man. Who? Jason? 'Cause if you're talking about Chris, mee-mah, he ain't all that cute. Yes, Chanel, I am speaking of Chris, but I'm not referring to his outer appearance. A beautiful spirit is something that can be passed on for generations. What are you passing on to Autumn? Tumny, baby, come on in the kitchen. Here, baby. Let your mama pass onto you how to take care of your flower your daddy gave you. You know why your daddy gave you that flower, tumny?

Well, let's see, miss willows. Okay. You haven't found a job and you haven't enrolled in school, either. Is that correct? Yes, but I... I also see here that you're asking me for a favor and you haven't even cooperated with the detectives. So tell me, Chanel, why should I allow you to walk your daughter to school? I know you don't think I deserve this, but my daughter Autumn does. Okay, so if not for me, then please do this for my daughter. I know I haven't gotten a job yet, but I am trying to be a better mother. Hello. Dear god, help this girl. She's trying, lord. Hello? 45 minutes, Chanel. 45 minutes you have to get home every morning. Now are we clear on that? Yes, thank you. Thank you, officer Davis. It's very clear. I will not be late.

You ready for court today? Yeah, Deandre, I'm ready. And you know, I love what we had. What? Listen, don't let me down. I mean, don't let yourself down. Deandre, I just think it's best if we let god... Decide. You know what, Chanel? You right, so I'll leave it at that. Yeah, let god work it out. I'll see you in court, baby. Okay. Bye. Father god, we thank you for your most gracious presence in our lives. You said if two or more come together in prayer, there you will be also. So we come together in prayer to ask you to bless Chanel with favor when she goes to court today. We ask you to bless her with favor, father god, greater than we can conceive. And in you, lord, we do have faith. - Amen. - Amen. Miss willows. You've claimed not guilty to the crimes you were charged with, but the d.A. Feels that he has enough evidence against you to convict you of all charges, so you will be required to face trial. Counsel for the defense, do you have any questions? Your honor, the defense asks the court to reconsider its position on miss willows' case. There is no hard evidence against her, nor has she been positively identified to have anything to do with this crime. In addition, we ask that miss willows be released from house arrest, so that she may go home to her family and obtain a job. A job, your honor. That is exactly what the defendant has not done. She has not cooperated with the detectives. She has not cooperated with her parole officer. Therein she has not cooperated with this court. Your honor, the prosecution not only wants to continue this trial against miss willows, but also would ask the court to revoke her privileges on house arrest and allow her to continue her fight in this case in the halls of justice, just like her crime mate Deandre stamps is doing. Well, attorney Leone, sounds like you have very valid points. We may have to go ahead and Grant you your... Your honor, with all due respect, my client has done her very best here. Your honor, if I may. I have just gotten some very important information concerning this case, and I would like to have a recess. A recess? One hour, sir. One hour recess! Thank you, your honor. Your honor, the district attorney has dropped all charges against miss Chanel willows. She's innocent. The district attorney will be bringing charges against miss keisha mcking. Yeah, that's her! That's her! She has confessed to all the crimes, your honor. My god! I can't believe it. Come to find out keisha had been messing with Deandre behind my back. The day we were arrested, she was the one who called the police, 'cause she thought I was going up there alone. And she was the one getting the cashier's checks to help Deandre set up the robberies. He told me he had got the computer chips from a liquidator. And to top it off, she broke into me and Deandre's crib before the police raided it and took Deandre's benz, our money and all our stuff. She was a cold piece. Was, that is. ♪ Jesus ♪ is the lord ♪ give him a chance ♪ a chance ♪ Jesus ♪ is the lord ♪ give him a chance, a chance. ♪ Thank you. Congregation, it's time to give thanks and praise to the most-high lord, our lord and savior and share with the rest of us how the lord has been good to you. Someone please come up and share some of your uplifting joy. Choir, keep singing that inspirational hymn. Why don't you? Why don't you? Happy and thankful is what I am this morning. The lord has truly blessed me. I was caught up and I got caught. But I went to jail, and I had an awakening. I saw that I had the meaning of life twisted. I was more concerned with a man and this season's fashions, money, than I was with my own blood... my daughter. I was selfish. I complicated my life. I complicated my family's life. Now I know... That it's the simple things in life. The simple things in life are worth more than all the riches in the world. And I am truly grateful that god has given me a second chance. So my house arrest has turned into a much-needed house rest. So I would like to say from the bottom of my heart... Thank you, lord. That's right. That's right.
