OK, my Christmas elves, the fillet is up. That risotto's almost done. Check the consistency. Make sure you don't forget the basil. We've got two minutes on the sea bass for table five. Make sure someone follows you with the sauce. How's your meal? Very good. Great. Thank you. So, we have a slight... problem. The waitress accidentally sold the flambe to table nine, and so, now we're out. No big deal, but now the wife wants something... off-menu. That menu is perfect. Every course complements each other perfectly. We can't do substitutions. Oh, I-I know the menu is perfect. But he's City Council... and the waitress promised we could do something special. Is there any way you could whip something up? I could do a tart with a vanilla ganache, or... Napoleon with a hazelnut drizzle. She wanted something a little bit salty. It won't go with her entree at all. Erm... I know - I'll do a pistachio crust with some Himalayan sea salt on chocolate-covered strawberries. She'll love it. Mm! It'll just take me a couple of minutes. Thank you. Welcome. You got it. You got it. YOU got it. And remember, great cooking isn't A to B. You've got to find the M-A-G-I-C. Each dish has to be extraordinary. Risotto's up. Mm... You really outdid yourself on the duck tonight. Just great reviews from a bunch of tables. What? Er... Well, er, it's just... the amount of duck. That got me thinking, erm, we've been friends forever. Which was why I was so excited to open our place together. And then, when Scarlett's was on all of the Best Of lists right away... I know, it was unreal. Absolutely incredible. But... the new buzz has died down. And the lines aren't around the block any more. Well, yeah, I mean, I know, but Christmas is a couple of weeks away, we'll get our numbers back up after. We always have a slump around the holidays. It has to do with what we serve. Which doesn't change. People love my menu. Yeah, but people want simple around the holidays, you know? Hearty and comforting. Christmas roasts, candied yams, snickerdoodles. Snickerdoodles? Yeah, meals with spirit that make people wistful and romantic about holidays. We are losing clientele. We have to cater to them. OK, what do you suggest? We need a holiday menu this year. No. No! Holiday menus bring down quality. They're too cutesy, they're too simple. We're going to keep our quality high and we'll bounce back, I promise. Well... I'm worried about Stetson. What? Why? Stetson loves us. I mean, he lets us do what we want. That's the best thing about him, he trusts our judgment. Well, he's coming by tomorrow night to check on everything. OK, great. Yeah, he can't resist my stuffed dates. I'll make them for him. It'll smooth things over and reminds him why we're a no-brainer investment. I'll pick up the ingredients on my way in. Right... No! Those potatoes? Yeah. It's quite the Christmas weather we're having, eh? Oh! Erm, hi. I-I think you have the last potatoes... Snow in New York City, nothing like it. Any way we could split those? You know, I-I could trade you for something, or... You know, I could buy them from you. I'd even pay a little more. What? Scarlett Bridges, as I live and breathe. James... Guidry. It's, erm, been a while. Yeah, years since Cordon Bleu. Mm-hm. Still as determined and persistent as ever, I see. First impression's a little strong. And you're still taking nothing seriously. Pushing your buttons is very serious business, Scarlett. Are you still doing that saying? What was it... "The magic of cooking is A plus B to the power three?" It's actually, erm, "Great cooking isn't A to B." "Let's find the M-A-G... I-C." It doesn't... matter. Right. I like that one. Listen, I'd really like to help you out, but I need these potatoes for a big dish. It's fine. How about you sing that song for me? No. Come on, Professor Saunders would be so proud. Yeah, I-I hated that song. And actually, I didn't need a song to remind me the names of spices... Just sing a little bit for me, and I'll give you the potatoes. Seriously? Mm-hm. Here? Yeah. TO THE TUNE OF "GOOD KING WENCESLAS" ♪ Adobo, ahi, Aleppo ♪ Anise, basil, and bay ♪ Brown sugar is sweeter than... ♪ You know what? I am done. That's enough of that. It was great, and I was just kidding. You can have the potatoes. I'm just going to get them somewhere else. Scarlett, I was just messing around. Please. Take the potatoes. You don't even have to pay for them. They're yours. OK, well, erm... lovely to see you, James. What, no "thank you"? You sounded great, by the way. And I guess I'll pay for the rest of your groceries. Sorry about that. Stetson. Hi. Claire. Mm! Great to see you. You, too. Well... I will have... Absolutely delicious. We'll get that right ready for you. Thanks. He's here. Stetson... is here. Great. And he ordered the ribeye palm puree. Perfect. And I'll throw that order of dates in right away. Girl, he doesn't look happy about the seating. Relax, OK? It's going to be the best meal of his life. Oh, my gosh! I mean, the kid broke, like, four glasses, too. Which is good luck on opening night! And every dish was perfect, and every diner left raving. I knew my confidence was well-placed. Which is why it pains me to give you this bit of news. I'm seriously considering selling my stake in the restaurant. What? Wh-Why? No, no, Stetson! Ladies, you know, I love working with you and believing you both. But the numbers... haven't been great lately. I-It's just a... slower time... for eating out. It's the holidays. The buzz at Scarlett's has unfortunately faded, and I'm worried that another down holiday season would spell big losses for the end of the year. I'm sorry, but it might not be feasible. Y-You know, that's not what we're forecasting. Erm... No. Because, erm, well... Er, Scarlett is working on a... fantastic... new holiday menu that's going to blow everyone out of the water! Hm. Interesting. A new holiday menu? Tell me more. Erm... yes. Erm... You know, I am still... I'm still working out the details a little bit, but I can tell you that it's going to be really fresh, seasonal dishes, and the courses are just, they're going to be very... unique and, erm... Uniquely traditional. Yeah! It'll put everybody into the holiday spirit. Traditional. If that's the case, I'll reconsider. I'm very excited to see what you've come up with. I will call Wyatt Bruce... Oh. And convince him to come get the menu reviewed. See you both later. Claire, are you crazy? Wyatt ripped us apart on the last review. I know, but we have no choice. If our angel investor leaves, negative press follows and, shortly thereafter, our staff begins fleeing. We will be shut down completely before we can even blink, Scarlett. Yeah, I know that. But... you promised a holiday menu that doesn't exist and dishes that I don't have. Keep it simple! I-It'll be fine. Wyatt Bruce is one of the top critics in the world, and he will crush us unless we have special items. You're right. It can't be ordinary. And it has been a few months since you put any new dishes on the menu. I just, I-I haven't been feeling inspired. OK? It's not something that you can just force. Especially in this short amount of time. Well, you have to. For Stetson. And for Scarlett's. Which needs it badly. Wait, don't you and Dad have a plane to catch. We do. But I wanted to drop off your gift for the holidays. Your dad's wrapping up a few work things before we hit the road for Italy. Aw, thank you. It's a, it's... It's a new sharpener for your knife set. Oh! Well... thank you. How's the restaurant? It's OK. Everything all right? Have you and Dad... ever had a restaurant fail? No. Why? Even one of the first ones? You know, know before the big hit with Tucson? I still don't understand why you sold that place. Scarlett, what's going on? We had some bad news tonight. Stetson told us that he might... pull out his investment. I know, and Claire wants this holiday menu, I mean, she's always wanted a holiday menu. And you don't? Well, no, I've never believed in them, but she... You know, she pitched it to him, and now he thinks it's amazing. And... I have to come up with this new holiday menu, which I'm not even confident is going to work. Scarlett. Do you think that Claire is passionate about your restaurant? She wants it to succeed? Yes. Absolutely. I'd say you both have that passion in common. You're just disagreeing on the path. Part of being a restaurant owner and leader is trusting your manager. I know how much you care about Claire. And having faith in your partner is sometimes all there is. Scarlett, you've always been such a talented chef. You always loved creating new delicious dishes. We couldn't keep you from inventing new tastes and recipes as a kid. We may not have had a restaurant fail, but we've certainly had to work on recipes, ones that didn't work and we just had to get right. And we both have complete confidence you'll figure that out. Even if it's not the plan you imagined. Sometimes you have to take the word of someone you trust who shares the same passion as you so you can hit the target deep down you know you're both aiming for. Right? Yeah, you're right. Thanks, Mum. I should get going. OK. Have a good trip. Oh, hey. Hey. I-I'm sorry, Claire. I know you want what's best for Scarlett's, just like I do. And, you know, if you feel that strongly about it, then I trust you. I'm sorry, too. And whatever you come up with is going to be great. And Wyatt will see the light. Yeah, he will. Mm-hm. Thank you, Claire, you're the best. And so, erm, on that note, I've been thinking, and I've come up with an idea. OK. And you need... inspiration. "The Season of Christmas"? Mm-hm. "For the holiday host looking for a new spin on" "traditional Christmas dinners." A cooking class? It's a little cheesy! But it'll help, I promise. I mean, this is for beginners. It's not for trained chefs. OK, come on, just go for some inspiration. What have we got to lose? You need to take this seriously - for the sake of our dream together. And I am. I just don't think the answer is peppermint and figgy pudding. It's going to be fine. I'm just, I'll do a riff on some of my old dishes. You know, I've made food that's cheery before. I'll just tweak those and add a little pixie dust. And besides, I can't just leave. The restaurant needs me. But we need something new, Scarlett. And I've already booked your ticket. And you're going to love it! Just go, find your inspiration again. Take some time off. We need it. Fine. Fine. Only because I trust you. Well, then, it's good to be me. Whoa. Mm! I get the candy cane one. It was definitely the most delicious. OK, candy cane it is. So, are you excited to learn some new recipes? I mean, I can't wait for this course. Yeah, I'm curious to see what they have. Us, too. I'm all thumbs at cooking, unfortunately. I always joke that my husband, Ed, had literally had all thumbs. Most people found that uncomfortable. I'm Roseland. Oh. Rosie for short. Scarlett. And over there is Ed. Ed, come here. This is Ed. Pleasure to meet you. Scarlett. Nice to meet you, too. He's a monkey. So, where are you both from? Er, just outside the city. In the 'burbs. Ah, beautiful. Yeah, we love it. Just... we only arrived here, what, a few hours ago? How about you? Oh, I just got in today. And I actually got in yesterday. I wanted to give myself a chance to look around. Jackie. Hi. It's beautiful here. Mm-hm. The trees, that crisp air when you know that snow is coming. Being up here in nature, it revitalises you. It's like a reminder that you needed a break when you didn't even know it. You know? I really do. Yeah, I was trying to put my finger on it when I was driving up. And that's... yeah, that's exactly it. And over there is Bryce and Gloria. Hi, I'm Bryce. I'm Gloria. Hi. Show 'em. Oh. We're newly engaged. Oh! That's beautiful. Congratulations. I'm Scarlett. Hi, Scarlett. Nice to meet you. Excuse me, everyone. If I can just have a moment, please. I, er, just would like to welcome you to the Season of Christmas! A week-long getaway where we'll be exploring your culinary voices, learning essential skills, and broadening cooking prowess through the magic of Christmas-time's beautiful food. Your families will be blown away this year. Thank you all for coming. I'm your host, James Guidry. Class starts tomorrow. But part of this course is about having fun and getting into the Christmas-time spirit. So, now we're going into town where I'll introduce you to the local shops of the area and deliver Christmas gifts! Because it's a nice, neighbourly thing to do, and it'll buy us all some wonderful Christmas charity with the shops we'll be using. I've got your gifts all bagged up right here, and... again, welcome to the Season of Christmas. I cannot believe you're running this. How about that? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. When I saw the name Scarlett Bridges on the class list, never did I think it would be you. Hm. It's me. What are you doing here? Oh, erm... Sorry. Merry Christmas. I, er, just hired some new chefs for my restaurant, and we have to teach them some holiday menu items. So, my partner and I thought it'd be a good idea that I brush up. Honestly, I'm just glad to hear you're doing so well. Your restaurant, too. Oh. Erm, thank you. You, too. Yeah, I'm really glad you're here. I'm happy you're taking the class. Frankly, it's rare to have another chef of your calibre here, so, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have you help me teach a few of the classes. Be a shame not to put all that expertise to use. Sure. Yeah, why not? Great. And this is the master kitchen we'll be doing all of our baking in. Used to feed guests in private parties at the villa. As you can see, the kitchen can handle any meal, large or small. And it's a place where pros work. And now, you do, too. I know we all got to know each other at the meet-and-greet the other night, but let's go around and share something about ourselves and why you're in this class. Rosie, how about you go first? Oh, OK. As you all know, we've been married for 28 years this June. Very happily. And this room, it's incredible. It makes me think of the beautiful places we went when we were dating. Yeah. But we're here because we used to have Christmas at our house, but, because we only know how to cook one thing, the family asked us to stop hosting. So, we need some new recipes, some new tricks. We can help with that. Jackie, how about you? Well, erm, I love Christmas. The best time to spend with my family. Now that my babies are out of the house, and it's the time of my happiest memories. Oh, and I know all the holiday recipes, but I keep on taking the class so I can keep sharp! Well, as we said last night, we are getting married. We haven't known each other that long, only a few months. But it's been a bit of a whirlwind love story. Yeah, to say the least. Now, because it's been such a whirlwind, our parents haven't exactly met yet. So, we're going to make them a big dinner. I've been cooking a while, so I already know most of this stuff, but Bryce is just starting out. New guy. And so, we just thought it would be a fun chance to learn something great. Well, we can help with that, too. And how about you, Scarlett? Oh. Me. Erm... I am a chef, and I graduated top of my class, actually, at Cordon Bleu, and now, I own a restaurant. You weren't always top of the class. Yeah, the top. Really, just right there at the top, the whole time, huh? Yep. Uh-huh. I mean, there may have been the odd occasion where someone else might have finished ahead of me. Super. So, you were amongst the top two in your class? That's great. I just wanted to clear that up for everyone. And... why are you here? Hm. I am here because I am a big fan of Christmas classics, just those, you know, simple recipes that are... so, so good. Great. Scarlett's actually going to be assisting me in today's session. Which I'm very excited about. But first, we're going to be diving headfirst into core concepts. Food prep and proper technique are a chef's greatest assets in the kitchen, especially when jumping into the Christmas classics. So, let's get started. We have to walk before we can run. The mise en place, or food preparation, not only saves you time and keeps you organised in the long run, but it also helps you acquaint yourself with the ingredients that will become part of your masterpiece. So, we'll practise proper chopping techniques on these yams, and the ingredients in front of us will later be used to make our candied yams. But remember to take your time. The more time you put in, the more proud of your dish you'll be. Sliced Christmas quiche. But with cranberries, honey, crumpled cheese... Ech. Ohh. Scarlett? I just don't seem to get the hang of this. Would you mind helping? Of course not. Whoa, OK. First, we're going to use this knife. OK. So, you're going to hold it steady with this hand, this one, you're going to go front to back, just rocking it. You see? The base will do most of the work. Oh. It's a little advanced. I think it's better to stick with the top-to-bottom method, Rosie. It's also more stable and safe. Rosie can do it. I mean, that's just such a basic cooking technique. It's like what I did with my training knives when I was nine. You can handle it right, Rosie? Erm... Yeah! Just believe in yourself. OK, OK. You had training knives when you were nine? You didn't? How old were you? 14. Doesn't matter. Well, look at that! Top... to bottom. Top-to-bottom. Ed, look! I'm getting it! Remember, guys, it's not a race. Take it slow and safe. Scarlett's going to step in and help demonstrate on this one. Thanks, James. This lesson is all about finding your artistic flair and decoration. Engaging that creativity is the heart of Christmas and, frankly, everywhere in the kitchen. And there's no better Christmas recipe to have up your sleeve than a good meringue. So, we're going to make meringue cookie snowmen. There's an art to shaping meringue. Follow the recipe, then form and add all the ingredients, dab some colour, add some chips as buttons. Just have fun. Now, begin. OK. Are you taking notes? Erm... Yeah. This is all... very useful. Wow, I didn't think you were taking this seriously. I mean, snowmen and meringue? How do you do it? Well, I mean, I can't really take credit for it. I remember this. You're being sarcastic. What? No. Oh, really? Erm... what do I do with those little chips again? It's more of a... surrealism version. Snowman. Voila. It can be sticky stuff, Bryce. You know, take a knife, and you can shape the edges if you want. Around the edges, right. Good work. This isn't the recipe, Scarlett, what are you doing? Well, the recipe's so simple. I thought we're supposed to be creative? The point is it's simple. The creativity's in the shaping the merengue. OK, well, I think I probably made it better. That's fine, but the lesson's about the art of creativity. These aren't even snowmen. There. Buttons. Beautiful snowmen. Oh, he's THE James? The one you always had the rivalry with? Yes. Can you believe it? I had no idea. Jeez! You two really used to fight. Oh, he's driving me nuts. He's still completely immature and stubborn. Oh, no. Yeah. I mean, I thought for a minute, maybe he'd grown up, but... no. Oh, and you should see some of the techniques he's teaching. Anyway, I am trying to keep an open mind. And I want to make this work. How are sales? Oh, er, well, they're holding. Not improving at all. But you need to keep your eyes on the prize. Just blow Stetson and Wyatt away. Yeah, I know. Are the classes helping at all? Not yet. No sparks of inspiration. OK. I will keep working on it. We just need a couple entrees and a dessert. I will figure this out, I promise. Scarlett, you are the best chef I know. Just... roll up your sleeves. I know you'll figure it out. Thanks, Claire. You're the best. You are. Great day, everyone. You should be proud. Now, we're just going to slide your cinnamon rolls into the oven. Have them for dessert after dinner. My only assignment is to come up with three new gingerbread concepts other than men. Other than that, have a great night. Pretty beautiful around here, isn't it? Yeah, it is. What, are you looking for inspiration? Yeah. Well, just remember, gingerbread ideas sometimes do grow on trees. That's not what I... Remember, try to have fun with it, Scarlett. Mm... that's delicious. Mm, Scarlett! Do you want your cinnamon roll? They left them for us. Aw, I'm OK. Thanks. They're delicious. We did a great job, if I do say so. Yeah. So, tell me, what type of meals does your restaurant normally serve? It's like, erm, upscale European cuisine. That sounds ambitious. But what I really love is the food that we make here. I've taken so many courses of these now. SHE LAUGHS You just keep taking them? Oh, yes, I love them. It's the food. The season. Now that my house is empty. My husband passed a few years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh... it's OK. It was a long time ago now. And I'm in a great place. But the holidays are when I get to see my family. It's not always easy to get in the same place at the same time. We were just about to start talking about Bryce and Gloria. And that special connection they have. Ooh. Oh. Honestly, it's been unbelievable. He's perfect. I don't know. Well, are you excited about the big holiday dinner? I am, yeah. Yeah. I think Bryce was a little nervous, just doing something so big at Christmas. But he's come around, and now, we're just both excited to bring our families together. You know? That's amazing. Yeah. It seems you have a little connection of your own. Er, me? Well, I've never seen James so... lively teaching. James? No, stop. No, I mean... Fine, he's got a little... more handsome over the years. He's still the same, just... irritating, competitive, frustrating chef he was back in school, so... It's not... no. OK. Hi, Mum. Hey. Just checking in. Thank you, I appreciate it. So, how's it going? Erm... good. Fine, I guess. Have you had any ideas for the new menu? Yeah, I've got some ideas. Gourmet pumpkin pie with buttermilk, sweet wafer crust, banana bread stuffing with sausage and sage. I don't know. Nothing that feels right. You know, when I got stuck, I used to think of the last dish that I truly loved from anywhere, and I let that inspire and guide me. In fact, that's how I came up with the holiday apple turnovers that year, remember? You asked me to make something that had never been made on Christmas, and I'd just had a great apple pie the week before, decorated with frosting and colours. You loved that. Yeah, I remember. I was, like, five? That was really, really good. Well, I just wanted to see how you're doing. Thanks, Mum. 'Night. Goodnight. Well, listen, guys, I've got something really special planned for later, but first, I'd like to see your gingerbread designs. Bryce, you're up. Erm... It's a mouse, and not a rat. It's a mouse. Oh, those are great. Good job. Thank you. And, er, a Christmas tree, a pickle, and, erm... Is that Santa's house? Close. But actually, it's his man cave. I'm really proud, guys. Very creative. Scarlett, you're up. Oh, erm, OK. Er... Huh. A little intricate for gingerbread. What's that, a ship in a bottle? Yeah, that's a ship in a bottle. Is that an oven? Oh, it's a confectionery oven for baking Christmas treats. And that's... Oh, that is a hotel in Switzerland I went to that had literally the best gingerbread I've ever had. Right, right. I don't think those will work. What are you talking about? I think they're... great. Anyway, well, you guys all have the recipes in front of you. Just really brainstorm with herbs and spices you want to use. And then, when we're done, we're going to go outside and make maple taffy. Ooh, that'll be fun. Let's go. Do you want to go outside and help me prep? Sure. OK. Students always love these maple syrup popsicles. If the syrup's seated just right, the snow should cool it perfectly. Then we add Popsicle sticks - and presto, instant taffy tree. You know, those designs were way too complex for gingerbread men. I mean, who remembers a random hotel in Switzerland, anyway? Well, if you'd tasted the gingerbread, then you would've remembered. Regardless, they're way too complex to make cookies out of, I think you have to rethink your whole concept. Well, I think you should rethink your cookie-making skills. Scarlett, great chefs know how to take directions. A good chef gives directions. That's what it just did. Thank you. We're just on a lunch break. So, apparently there's a shop in town that sells rare ingredients, so I'll check it out. I'm going to try and sneak into the kitchen later and do some experimenting. Mm, great idea! Good work, Scarlett. How's it going there? Oh, it's OK. You know, soldiering on without you in the kitchen, doing reasonable replicas of your easy dishes. You know, actually, some guy said he liked the chicken better. Don't want him back. OK, tell me what you think about these holiday ideas. Chocolate eclair with gold and coffee shavings, or, like, erm, a riff on French croqueenbouche? Oh, I don't know. OK, well, you don't sound excited about any of those. Yeah, I'm not really. Scarlett. I know! I know. If I'm not excited, then Wyatt definitely won't be. I just need to find the M-A-G-I-C. I need fresh and unique. I happen to be in the most Christmassy market I've ever seen, so I'm on the hunt. Well, I love it. I'll talk to you later. OK. Bye-bye. Hello? Hello, Scarlett. Erm, Mr Bruce. Hi. It's very nice to speak with you. Nice to speak with you, too. I wanted to reach out and Stetson gave me a call. But I heard you were out of town. I-I am. Yes, I just love to go to new areas and, sort of, er, immerse myself as inspiration for new dishes. Mm! Always in the laboratory. I admire that. And I admire your palate. It's... very discerning. So... what's going on? Well, aside from my usual critic duties, I have actually been getting into the business side of food recently. I'll get a little taste of your world. OK, that sounds great. You know, I've been following you since your days at Cordon Bleu. And I admit, you know, I was a little harsh on you before. But Stetson raves about you and said that you have some amazing dishes in store. They're going to blow me away and reinvent the Christmas menu. Oh... yes, we do. We are, erm, very excited for you to try them. Well, I'm looking forward to it. Looking forward to it, too. All right. Bye. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Good morning. May I help you? I was wondering, do you have any cookbooks, maybe... outside-the-box recipes? Mm, we have regular cookbooks over there. They're seasonal. Erm... what about... self-help? Like, thought-expansion? That's called eggnog this time of year, sweetie. By the ornaments. What are you actually looking for? Oh, erm, I'm a chef. I'm... looking for inspiration. Oh, well, that's a tall order. Our cookbooks do have plenty of festive recipes, feel free. But I don't think that self-help or thought-expansion will help. No? The great thing about Christmas is that every year, you get to see the entire world from a new angle. You open yourself to it, it'll change your perspective. No book works as good as that. Thanks. I like that. It's the moment we've all been waiting for. We're going to make real dishes. We're going to get real practice, making some wonderful Christmas classics, beautiful, wholesome recipes your whole family will love, all leading up to a big surprise I have for you. Without further ado, let's get started. Exciting stuff going on over here, really. I, er, love the creativity, but... I think this is going a little too far. I don't think so. I love the dedication, too, but tradition still has its place in these meals and without embracing that while being creative, you're not going to capture what makes a Christmas meal special. Just saying. Well, I disagree. I think I'm going to blow people away. OK, if you think so. Best of luck. Thank you. Well, looks like things are going really well over here. It is. I'm surprised no-one thought of this sooner. Yeah, they did. They're called gingerbread men. Not like this. You know, I'd give you a taste, but I don't want to blow your mind just yet. Pretty confident. Why don't we let the class decide when you're finished? Done. OK... James and I are having a little disagreement. So, I was hoping that you would help us settle something. I present to you gingerbread that you eat with a spoon. Gingerbread tiramisu. It's a little bit unique, but it's delicious. And I know you're going to love it. Congratulations. Thank you. Shall we? Scarlett has created something, a new dish, a new take on a classic. Now be honest. Which do you prefer - gingerbread cookies or the tiramisu? That's really great. Yeah... delicious. But you don't always have a spoon. This is great. The cookies just feel better Christmas. The fun part is making all the little shapes, you know? I like the cookies. I surrender. Want go for a walk? Sure. Sorry about today. Oh, it's fine. Remember the old ancient saying "a cookie should stay a cookie". OK, OK, I get it. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Did you always know you wanted to be a chef even before Cordon Bleu? Always. I guess that makes sense. Suits you. I never had any doubts, either, but... So, how come you're not...? Running my own restaurant? Yeah. I was... for two years, serving high-end food farm-to-table, and I poured every ounce of my heart into it. And when it failed, it destroyed me, and that's how I got into teaching. Hm. Sounds like you gave up on your dream. No, that's it... I like this much more. Maybe you just haven't found the right situation yet. Maybe. I didn't think it was going to be for me, but I had a student tell me he wanted to become a chef because he was inspired by my class. And that's... that's why I fell in love with it. Yeah. So, I'm not actually here to brush up on dishes, to train chefs. My restaurant's in trouble, and if I don't come up with an... incredible holiday menu to impress a critic, then... I might lose it. You know, my parents were in the restaurant business my entire life. And because of that, I never really had a real Christmas. They were just always in the kitchen during the holidays. I mean, they would do stuff to try and make it special, like have my favourite pie in the oven or decorate cookies or these handmade figurines we'd hang around, but they were just always at the restaurant. Always. I guess I kind of feel cheated cos... looking back, I... wish it was different. Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I had something else planned for the last couple of days, but I brought you here this morning to announce that we're just going to skip ahead to the final project, where you're going to develop your very own signature dish, something special from the heart that you can take and show off as your very own using the skills you've learned and putting your lessons to work. And at the end, there's going to be a final taste test where you'll be judged on what you've done and how far you've come. But first... we're going to do something a little different. To make Christmas food really great, you need to be in the holiday spirit. So, during your breaks, I encourage you to get out and explore the grounds, make snowmen, ride sleighs. Just make this place your own winter wonderland. Now... go have fun. Whoo! Let's go, Rosie! I'm not sure what's below first gear, but I'm pretty sure you're in it. I haven't been on one of these things in years! Scarlett, sometimes you just have to let go. You can't control everything. I'm scared I'm going to fall. Well, you're certainly not setting any speed records at that pace. Oh, yeah? See you at the bottom, James! Oh... Ahh! Hey! Whoo! Ahh! Hey! Hey! Quit wrecking my snow angel! You call that a snow angel! So, what was it about teaching? You mean, "What made me stop wanting to be an executive chef?" Yeah. About a year after the restaurant folded, took a local job at a community college. Students were adrift, trying to figure things out. I was having a hard time getting them to understand the core concepts we learned at the Bleu. Some wanted to goof off. Some thought they knew everything. Hm. Sound like anyone you know? Me? I just decided to throw out the curriculum. Told them the grades didn't matter, and we were going to make dishes that they'd had at restaurants they'd never made themselves. And professional kitchens are cut-throat. I don't know. I realised that I never had the same joy giving dishes to customers that I had when I saw pride in my students' faces after they made their own dish. I'll admit... that I haven't felt this inspired and creative in a long time, so you're pretty great teacher. I'm really glad you came. And I hope you find whatever you're looking for. Yeah, me, too. So, how's the course going? Great! I've really been enjoying the things we've been doing lately. Yeah, I can hear it in your voice. You sound happier. Yeah. And how's it going with James? Um... actually kind of good. Yeah. And I don't know if you know this, but he had his own restaurant, this farm-to-table place, and when it went under, he started teaching and he worked with this group of college kids, sort of helped focus them through cooking. He seems super passionate about helping people. I never saw that side of him before. And then he has these outdoor activities that we've been doing, and it's been really helping to inspire... Oh, my goodness! You like him! What? No, I don't. What are you talking about? Uh, yes, you do. What, "passionate", "helping kids", "growth" - sounds like all the ingredients to an irresistible little recipe to me. Oh, stop, it's not like that. OK. Oh, more importantly, I have a new menu idea for Wyatt. So... I am thinking my take on a sweet potato souffle with a vanilla bean creme. I think it's going to be perfect. Oooh, he's going to love it. That sounds great. Yeah, he will. We just have one more entree and a dessert to go. Keep rolling up your sleeves. If anyone can do it, it's you. Thanks, Claire. Bye. Bye. Hey, what's up? Hey, with all the busyness going on, I fell behind in decorating the rest of the tree. What are you talking about? It's beautiful. This one's fine, but that's a little underdressed for a holiday ball, and I keep telling everyone that Christmas decorations in the house create an ambience that elevates the food. It's all part of the chef's presentation. It's true. It's missing something that... I don't know, something specific to us, something from the heart. I was going to head into town to get some more decorations. Do you want to come? Sure. So, this is one of the perks of teaching? What, free time? Yeah, it was my favourite part about school. I used to get in quite a bit of trouble. But Bryce and Gloria did far better than they ever thought they could and will always remember their experience here. And who knows? Ed and Rosie might surprise themselves and start a cookie shop sparked by something they learned in class. You know, there's a joy in food and learning how to make it that I think we forget about sometimes. I mean, isn't that part of why you wanted to be a chef? Maybe, but I also learned that I can make a better funnel cake than this. I don't know about that. So, what are we looking for again? Scarlett, we are looking for an ornament that speaks to you, something special that reminds you of why you love the holiday season. You know, something that will put a smile on your face. You know, that's what our tree's missing is something specific and personal to the class. You know? I do. Like something like this. Hm. Oh... Hello. Hey, Scar-LETT. It's Scarlett. Um, hi, Mr Bruce. Now that that's done, you ready to get back to class and... Um... Class? You're taking a class? No, she's, uh... she's assisting me, a VIP demonstrator. I had to call in three favours just to get her to pick up the phone. Wow, very nice of you. Um, yeah, just trying to give back. Hey, Scarlett, do you have a second to talk? I do. Listen, when I mentioned earlier about the business side of things, well, I'm opening my own restaurant, high-end brasserie, harkening back to the old world. It's all very exciting. Congrats. Now, we only have a little while before opening, and to put it frankly, I am stressed. I can't find the right head chef. I have to admit you're on my very short list. And I understand that you have Scarlett's. I just think that your talents would be better suited for a different type of food. Is there any chance you'd be interested? Wow, I'm... I'm flattered. Thank you so much. Um... no, Scarlett's... is my home. It's my dream, and I can't just abandon it. Hey, you know what? I understand. Yeah. But I'm excited to impress you next week. All right, bye now. Bye. Where'd that come from, anyway, that M-A-G-I-C? Stop! My mom has always had a tendency for the straightforward when designing her recipes. Yeah, she starts out with something simple. She'll incorporate something easy. She'll perfect that before she makes it her own. I mean, don't get me wrong, she's a great chef, she's... amazing actually. But... you know, I wanted to do my own thing, so I came up with the saying to remind myself to always look for the extraordinary, push myself to be the most creative, strain if I had to. So you can beat your mum? Yeah, I... I mean, she casts a really big shadow. It was really hard for me to go out on my own. She had expectations, especially from her. Now, our relationship's a little bit complicated. I wish it was simpler, to be honest. It sounds like your mum just wants what's best for you, and honestly, you should be grateful she cares so much. Because, yeah, her love might be tough... but is that maybe because you're tough on her, too? Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Now that's what I call a perfect tree. Yeah, even better than before? Much. Those are so great. Yeah, you like them? I have a very particular method for picking out my ornaments, and you followed it. So, you get to see your whole family at Christmas? Oh, goodness, yes. It's my favourite time of the year. And I know I get overexcited, but I get to learn new tricks in all of these courses. Mm. That makes me happy sharing them with my kids. I can't even imagine you with your recipes and your family. Oh, I don't know. Tell me, what is your strategy for picking ornaments? Oh, well, I just look for ones that make me remember Christmas, all of the good times and all of the bad. Really? The bad ones, too? The first Christmas after my husband passed, it was just me and the kids. And Fred had all of these things that he liked to do - rituals, little customs... like arranging the presents in weird shapes or hiding acorns. Oh, but if you found it, you got the first pancake. OK. So, we're just sitting there, looking at presents just stacked normally, not knowing how... how to feel. So my youngest finds the acorn that I hid... looks at it and bursts out laughing. And then before you know it, we all are. You know, in memory of him and those crazy tricks that he used to do. That was good. It's the best. And it is the most meaningful Christmas that my family's ever had even though it didn't start out so good. Wow. So, every time I see acorn decorations, I buy them, and I think of that. Because, no matter what, the really best memories, they come from the most unexpected places, and they might mean more than you know. You know? That's beautiful. Thank you. Oh, hey. Mind if I come in? Sure. Do you want to taste? That's not some weird souffle or, like, mashed potatoes and a salt shaker, is it? Peanut butter shortbread cake. My family and I used to make the cookies every year during the holidays. It was, like, a tradition. So, this is my take. That is the best thing you've ever made. Really? Yeah, I've tasted a lot of it. Yet no matter how busy we were, we always made sure that we made them. I mean, they were quick and nothing fancy compared to what they made their guests, but I love them. That's your mum's recipe? Yep, and she always added nutmeg. That was, like, a little touch that only she would think of. And I think I was the one that thought of the peanut butter, so... It was my grandmother's cookie recipe, my mum added the nutmeg and I was the peanut butter. Sounds like the whole family had a hand in it. So, it doesn't always have to be something unique or something special, it's about taking people back to the things they love. I was thinking, you know what you said about your childhood Christmases and feeling like you were cheated and didn't have a real Christmas. Yeah. I think you're looking at it all wrong. Those were unique Christmases, and they sounded great. Ah... I mean... They might not have been traditional under a tree in the family room, but... Well, I mean, I was working. Yeah, and look what you got out of it. That's real family history in that cake. Might not have been straining or the M-A-G-I-C you were looking for, but... that's real magic. And I know there's no other place that you'd rather be than in the family business. Maybe. The joy of the season was in those rooms, Scarlett. There was love in those rooms, and at the end of the day, that's what the holidays are all about. You know, you didn't always play it safe. Yeah, maybe. Ah... It's getting late. We've got a long day tomorrow. We should probably get to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight. I just want to congratulate you all. You should be very proud. In our time here together, you've grown, you've learned, you've developed amazing culinary skills. You came here to be true holiday chefs, and I am happy to welcome you into that league. I'd let you cook my Christmas dinner any day. And I have no doubt that all of your dishes will taste incredible, so thank you all and for your help, too. Raise them up! Cheers! Cheers! To you guys! Cheers. That was delicious. Thank you. This, uh... reminds me of the old days, being in class. Yeah, almost. So, how, pray tell, are your dishes coming along? For the restaurant, I know you've been working on a few. They're coming. I've got both the entrees. I just am still missing a dessert. Listen... I wanted to thank you. For what? For giving me the time to try and figure it out, and... for everything. Really, this whole experience has been way more than I ever thought it was going to be. Yeah, for me, too. You know, I have to confess, when we were at Cordon Bleu, I was always looking over my shoulder to see what you were doing. Really? I was definitely paying attention, too. Probably why I was a little more... harsh with you than I should've been. Oh! Harsh? Yeah, OK, that's what we'll call that. I'm sorry, too. And as far as Scarlett's, there isn't anything you can't do. I've always thought that. And as far as dessert goes, you seemed to be on the right track the other night with your holiday magic. Those shortbread cookies were to die for. Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, I've always thought you were a great chef. Maybe even almost as good as me. But I'm serious, you're so talented, you should get back out there and show it off in the real world, not just out here in the mountains. Thanks. Hey, I have a surprise for you. OK. James, this is Wyatt Bruce... and he's here to judge the final. Oh, OK. Isn't that great? Yeah, sure. I made a call, and he very graciously agreed to come up last minute. Now, he knows he won't be trying my dish because that's for next week at Scarlett's. Mm-hm. But a critic of his stature will only bring prestige to your great class, which I've told him a lot about. Yeah, it's a pleasure. Scarlett has been raving about your course. I'm excited to see what you have here. Thank you for coming. Welcome. Not bad. Spiced cranberry because I've done some... Mm. It's going so well. Yeah. Don't you think that went great? Everything just went so perfectly. The meals were awesome. I think you really shined. That could've gone terribly for those students! Luckily it didn't, but it so easily could've. What?! What are you talking about? It was just a big dog and pony show for you and Scarlett's. What? No, I did that for you. Look, I wanted him to see you because you're a great chef and you're great in the kitchen. I appreciate that, but I told you that I don't... The only reason I invited Wyatt here is because you deserve to be back out there. He's hiring a chef for his new restaurant. But I told you I don't want that, and those students didn't need the extra pressure. You mean YOU don't want the extra pressure? I mean, you couldn't handle criticism in school and you still can't. So you removed yourself from it. You're playing it safe, but you can't hide out in the mountains teaching beginner classes forever. You don't get it. James... No, you haven't changed one bit, Scarlett. Hey, James... are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on, let's talk. No, I'm OK, Rosie, thanks. I said come on. We're talking. OK, coming. Yeah. Got a ten-person party coming in just before... Hey. Oh, hey, you're back. Give us a minute, OK? You can handle things out front. She doesn't hear people, and she's always been like that. I know that she was trying to help, but... It's crazy. I always liked being in the kitchen with Scarlett. Even though she drove me nuts, I couldn't wait to go to school every day. It just... made me feel... alive. And she's right. I could take more risks. And I love teaching, but... I do want more. You know, when Ed and I first met, you might find this hard to believe, but he was a lot to take in. Everything he said either made me laugh or got under my skin. Made me angrier than I'd ever been. But after we started talking, I mean really talking... I started to ask myself why that was. Turns out the things he was saying were truths I didn't want to hear, best things for me. And it was only years later, he told me he figured out the same things. Gloria and I had an argument. I just think this Christmas dinner's putting a lot of pressure on us. Gloria thinks that it's the solution, so I think I'm just really nervous about doing all of this. No matter what happens with that dinner, you're marrying an incredible woman. Mm-hm. And that's what matters. I guess all that matters, isn't it? Yep. Yeah, he said it wasn't what he wanted. I tried to apologise, but... yeah, that was it. I still remember those calls from cooking school, you know, you venting about how crazy James made you. And I remember thinking that you two were pushing each other, you know, always looking over each other's shoulders, driving yourselves to be better. Yeah. And isn't that what it's all about? You know, even if neither of you could see it? And... James was right about something. What was that? Your drive and competition makes you great. And you think Christmas menus bring down restaurants. And you need to be the best. But that shuts people out of your life. It puts these blinders on to the love they show you. You've been a part of the family business ever since you put peanut butter in those cookies. And I'm sure that's not the last time your mother thought that she'd be cooking with you. You know, the memories of sprinkle fights and baking pies in kitchens, those are wonderful Christmas stories. You know, James is right about that, too. And I was wrong earlier. Instead of searching for something extraordinary, I wish you put a different ingredient into the recipes that you love... and welcome the people in who want to share Christmas memories with you. That's the only Christmas wish that I have for you, Scarlett... regardless of Scarlett's. Thanks, Claire. And if you don't believe me, I... I brought some backup along who might be able to convince you. She cut her trip short for you. Hi. Mum! I didn't know you were coming back so early. Well, Italy's overrated anyway. And there was only one seat left on the flight, so I took it. Were you going to ask me to work alongside you at Tucson? I had hoped you'd take it over from us eventually. Then when I just left and started this, you sold it. Yeah. I'm sorry. I can't believe I didn't see it. I was just so stubborn and determined to get out on my own, I just didn't realise it. No, it's all right. I didn't ask. I meant to, and then you were off and we were proud of you. I was just a little sad that maybe you didn't want to. And then I didn't know what to say. I'm sorry, too. No, it's all right. And you're a tough act to follow. You are! You are such a great chef, and I think I may have been a little competitive with you, which is a problem. You know, growing up, I always thought that whatever restaurant you guys had at the time was more important than me during the holidays. And I know that's obviously not true, and you just, you know, you just wanted to share what you loved with me. Yes, that's right, sweetheart. With a little help from some people that I care about, I realised that even though I haven't been there lately, I've always been a part of the family business and... that makes me happier than they ever knew, so... thank you. We'd love to spend Christmas together after your big presentation here... away from a kitchen. Yes, please. Anywhere you'd like. I would love that. Hey, it's make-or-break time. Absolutely. They're going to be here in a few hours, so we have until then to figure out a dessert to end this meal. Well, I'm here to help, whatever I can do, as long as that's all right. Hey, Mum, do you... do you remember those little gingerbread horses that we made when I was a kid, the ones with the interesting texture? Of course. Why don't we just make those today? I mean, we already have dishes that are really complex and interesting. You know, maybe ending with something simple will be sweet, and we can use your gingerbread recipe because it's the best. I love that. You do? Absolutely, but that's not just my recipe. You're the one who made me add the oatmeal and the glaze when you were nine. Don't you remember? I don't... but I'm happy I do now. Scarlett and Joanne, Stetson and Wyatt. Good evening, everyone. Hello again. Merry Christmas. Nice to see you both. If you're ready, I brought my appetite. Shall we? Why are they in the kitchen? They insisted. You got this. OK. I must say I wasn't exactly sure of the meal I'd have today, but I'm happy to admit it's all that I hoped for. Wonderful, imaginative, heartfelt Christmas magic in all its sense. I absolutely loved it. Kudos to you, Scarlett. Not only is it some of your best work, but it's just what I wanted for this time of year. And I have a feeling that your guests are going to crave it, too. Way to go. That's all I needed to hear. I'm very happy to say that not only will I stay on, but I'd be thrilled to extend as well. What...? As long... as we continue to have Christmases like this. Oh, thank you! Thank you so much! Oh, my...! Raise a glass, ladies! OK. Thank you. It's James. He's... he's outside. Well, go! Go! Go! Go! Do I look OK? Go! OK, OK. I cannot believe you're here. Couldn't miss your most important day. I bet it went great, you killed it and your partner loved your 12-layer holiday souffle. He did, but I also made some dishes I think you would've loved. I bet. So... I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said, and I'm sorry that I said you hadn't changed because that's not true, and I know you were just trying to help me, but... I just wasn't ready to hear it, and... Actually, there's a lot of things that I haven't been ready to hear until now. I'm sorry, too. You know, I shouldn't have overstepped and called Wyatt. No, I'm glad you did. I mean, I love teaching, but there's a lot more that I want to do. And you're right, I need to take more chances. You know, you've always pushed me to be better. HE SCOFFS You have! And... I was wrong about the holidays... about a lot of things, but... especially about you. This is the best holiday season I've ever had. And I'm tired of playing it safe with my feelings, too. I want to spend every Christmas like this... with you. We are booked through to the end of the month. Yes! Nice work. Is the class list up yet? You'll be teaching three classes next year at the Seasoning of Christmas. Perfect. Here it is! SHE GASPS Oh... Wow! Aww! That looks fantastic! Amazing! Oh, thank you. Now that is the Christmas M-A-G-I-C.
