I'm your agent, we gotta talk. Wait, I'll answer the call... Marilyn Monroe came out in Playboy And a calendar Landed without clothes Everyone wondered Mom called her a slut... But she has sold millions of magazines and tripled his fortune. She was rude and a bit naive. And when asked: "Honey what were you wearing?" Believe me, she replied: "I was just using that song Nothing, just that song I do not believe, What do you too? And believe me this is a beautiful song... Using only this song. The young Burt Reynolds also proved. In Cosmo, everybody saw it. On a bearskin rug and a smile. Hand over the treasure. He had good taste And three decades later My mother is still amazed! But when it no longer a novelty embarrassed in my city... Burt became the number one... And he used only this song... Just used this song... Now tell me, What's wrong? And believe me this is a beautiful song... Using only this song. Only a few dreams And with a pleasing personality Even though ambitious, I'm shy. (He's shy!) But know that even liked... With flashes on me. And with the clicks of cameras... I felt like a star (One star) And I was only using this song. Using only this song... Using only this song... Now tell me, What's wrong? And from now on will always play my song Yes! Using only this song... I'm fine. And much better than the rest. Using only this song... Using only this song... Using only this song...

Drinking lots of water and not beer, Or discuss the consistency of your skin. That's where I sear... I really want is Robert Mitchum. Do not you remember him? He did Cape Fear? That was not just a movie, was something extraordinary for me He was sexually and murderously serious. Tough and lightly dressed. I'll never forget The close in his eyes that gave He knew exactly what to do. A perfect tan In the era of real men. As Robert Mitchum. And I'm not alone... For us, We want the days of Robert Mitchum. When the guys came in all shapes and sizes. And some even managed a couple. And as played out conversation...
