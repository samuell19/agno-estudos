Bogdan Khmelnitsky In the XVII century, Ukraine was under a heavy oppression by the Polish gentry. Time and again people rose against the Rzeczpospolita (Polish?Lithuanian Commonwealth, further: PLC), but could not lose the Polish yoke. First-class, by the standards of the time, the Polish army made short work of the rebels, committing villages and towns to fire. *organ and choir* Who is that tall knight? Don't you know? But it's Chaplinsky. He destroyed Khmelnitsky's khutor, killed his son and took his wife. - Yes? It's beautiful. - Yes? No, no, not there. Over there, near the column. - Ah, this pale lady next to Mrs. Chaplinsky? - Well, yes. - Couldn't he find a wife among the Catholics? - She is, but a noble. - I do not envy him. - Why? He killed Khmelnitsky's son! On the fifth day we shall lead Bogdan on a noose like a dog. All the way to Warsaw. On the fifth? May God bless... In one night I destroyed his farm and grabbed you. Zaporizhian Sich will be destroyed in five days. If I didn't want you to, you wouldn't take me. Christians! Tell you we must that schismatic Khmelnitsky fled to the Sich! He sent kholops all over Ukraine! To call the rabble together to Zaporozhye! He gathers an army to raise the sword against the PLC! - Zheniye(?) on Khmelnitsky! - On this schismatic! To the stake! Kholops, while we ???, sharpen their scythes, await the schismatic I bless your weapon, which shall cleanse the PLC from the Schism with fire! In the name of our King... In the name of our King, I declare Zheniye(?) on the Zaporizhian Sich! I declare Zheniye(?) on the Sich! The army shall be lead by ??? Stefan! - Viva! - Viva! - Viva! - What you called? - Ivan. - Why have you come to the Sich? - Don't you know? Got no life at all. - Who is your master? - Master Skorynsky. What can you say about him? - Nothing I can say about him. - Why? - I killed him. - A sacred task you've done. Show your hands. - ??? - No. - You haven't betrayed the Holy Faith, have you? - No, Holy Father. - Know the Lord's Prayer? - I do. Go ahead! - Our Father in heaven... - Shhhh... - You like vodka? - I do! Oh! A true Christian soul! - Kiss the cross, God's servant John. - Pashuk, check him into the third hut. Next! Ah! You Satan! Great! And I thought you were dead. I've heard you were very sick. Alive thank God! What?! Ivan! Balyk! Who's this with you? My lad. Ivan, bow to the ground to father otaman. And what's that you got? Dovbnya, iron bound. Couldn't find him a saber. Whichever he picks, each one is light! Still he fights... and good too! And how much weight is there to you dovbnya, son? A pood or two. Go ahead, take a swing. - So? - A good lad you got, you Satan. We'll call you Dovbnya. And that's the name you'll be checked under into a hut. It's nothing... father otaman! The skin doesn't have to be patched! It'll heal itself! You asked for it! Teach them, Ivan, teach them good! Teach them so that their hands become strong, able to meet the polack masters. And we'll bring the new ones to you. Farewell, brothers! Farewell, tough knights! Go from village to village! Throughout Ukraine make your song sung. Farewell, tough knights! Uplift the people! Call to fight the gentry! So that everyone who doesn't want to die a kholop could start growing wings! So that castles burn and in the night illuminate the road for our army! Oh, how that black cloud's advancing... But then it's no cloud, it's the enemy forces... Spit, children! Spit into fucking polacks' eyes! Laugh, children! Laugh at the polacks! I am surprised at the king's orders. Shame to besmear the noble saber with Zaporizhian cattle. I'll use whips to disperse them. As true as I love God, reverent lady, the first cossack I see shall be decapitated with this saber. In your honor! It seems to me that the gentleman has the opportunity to prove it. For the King! At the time of the Tatar-Mongolian yoke, at the terrible time for Russia, our grandfathers did not know such suffering. Lord, lord, look! - Who are you? - Ambassadors of the king of Moscow. Prince Trebetskoy. Lord Pushkin. Going to the King in Warsaw! Who would you be? I'm Stefan Potocki. Listen, you! Make way for the PLC army! And in Russia Ambassadors are given way! And in Poland - the sword! Take it easy, Prince. I can see that. Make way for the PLC knights! Schismatics. Lucky for you you're an Ambassador! Zaporizhian Sich welcomes you, Maxim. I walked the road of death to you. From Nezhin to Kiev itself Potocki drove stakes into the ground and our people are dying on them. Ask them! Maxim Krivonos, Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky wishes to see you! Tell the Hetman: Maxim Krivonos awaits him here. Less than a month has passed since this strong-willed man became the Hetman, but he's already managed to lure all of your men to the Sich. Bogun, Thor. Krivonos has just arrived. As soon as Krivonos sets foot on the Sich, Khmelnitsky will arrange a new order. He'll make him... Although Khmelnitsky's hand... Any day now we'll have to flee in random directions. Rather he'll have to. Hush, hush you, hush. Well, why are you worried? What are you unhappy about? We chose Khmelnitsky for a Hetman, so that he'll listen to us, worthy men! And he knows that you don't want a war with Poland. That you're against the alliance with Moscow. Yeah? Moscow's far, and Potocki's close. Huh? Yeah! - Quiet, you. - Potocki's got tens of thousands of armed Polacks and we 6000, plus unarmed populace. - Us and Moscow go different ways, we have to make peace with Potocki! - Oh quiet, quiet! We have to make peace with Potocki! - Who would you rather call on to be the Hetman? - Who? And even if you. You're a scribe... you're loved and respected by every cossack. - What for? - For heart, smarts and for commitment to worthy people. Farewell, friends. I'll go and listen to what the Hetman says. The Hetman of the Zaporizhian Army Zynoviy Bogdan Hmylnitsky! Hail! - Hail! - Hail! Have you called me, Maxim Krivonos? Not me alone, but them, the army that I had brought! The dead with scythes! Ukraine is waiting for you, Hetman! A rumor has spread, about you sending messengers to the king of the PLC and postponed the rebellion for a year! And you believed... Maxim Krivonos... Nay, I await an answer. Answer, Hetman! Answer to Maxim Krivonos! - Answer! - Answer! I've sent the messengers. It's true! But not to the king. To the Russian people, asking for help. This night we set a day for a campaign on gentry Polacks! Ten barrels of vodka to the Krivonos army! Hail the military scribe Lizogub! You're cool... cold as death... Whoever took you in hand, became the leader of the army, which has been envied by many a king. But no one could keep you for life. Cool you are! Deathly cold. You hetmen firmly held, but lacked the brain. - You haven't been seduced by unions? - No. - You haven't betrayed the Holy Faith? - I have not. - Oh my, how many you are! Know the Lord's Prayer? - I do. - You like vodka? - I do! A true Christian soul! Kiss the cross, God's servant. Don't suck, kiss. - Pan Potocki loves to torture people! - We know. - I know the Lord's Prayer, I like vodka. - Hands! Go ahead and do the sign of the cross! - Tell me who sent you here! - I fled! You're lying, polack! - Look at the sky! See the God's dawn? - I do! Won't see it again. Tell! Or I swear on your mother, I'll discharge a pistol at you! I fled! Heard he went with his son to the Khan in Bakhchysarai. With his son... but he returned alone. So where is your son? I used him to seal the contract with the Horde. Stay down. It was necessary. If not us, the king will make an alliance with Islam Giray. And the horde hits us in the back. - Khan forced you to give up the son and you agreed? - Yes. - And you know, the first failure... - Gimme some tobacco, Maxim. Yours is stronger. (I have only a vague idea of what he means here: an offer for a smoke?) Hetman, the Tatar has arrived on the island. Umsa Tugay Bey, the great knight... Maxym! Stand by. Hello, Tugay the knight! Healthy Slomanus! - Here. - Here. Well? How are your ribs? Grown together? Grown, grown. Well? And how is your nose? Illustrious Khan Islam Giray ordered me to help you with a sword in a fight with the Polack camp. A 1000 knights await your order. You cannot give me orders! I'm not giving an order, reverent lady But you have to understand that the fate of the country depends upon you. Your eyes shall stop the beast faster than the knights' sword. - I'm not going anywhere! - Lady Helen! I am not a slave who you can play with! I am a Catholic! I'm a noble! - Lady Helen! - Denied! Calm yourself, reverent lady. Our merciful God will help you. Your Excellency sends me into hell! And there is no God in hell! - God has power over hell too! - In that case, Adam Kesel will go to Bogdan Khmelnitsky with me! Lady Helen! - Lady Helen! Wait! - I will not go by myself! Lady Helen! - Where is the Holy Father? - Pray, my son. Lady Helen! Lady Helen! I will not go by myself! Think about what you're saying. Aren't there any knights in PLC, so a woman is forced to go to war? Lady Helen... But when they are gone, I'm not just going to the schismatics, but to Satan himself! Helen! Pray! Our Father commands you to go by yourself. - Ah! Good taran! Pity there's not enough vodka. In the health of our Lord! - Oh, taran's great! - Great! In the health of the Virgin of the Immaculate! - Wait up, clerk. - Wha? - Are you, then, at a wedding or something? - You must be kidding! Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk, Kozhukh! You're a sinner, Kozhukh! Drink to the apostles! Twelve Saint lads! Kozhukh, there's not a drop of vodka in paradise for you. In heaven, oh Lord, only angels sing. Hey, clerk, God's servant, Bogdan Khmelnitsky ordered to send for you to demons in hell and immediately. Although I am a servant of God, I can find friends among demons! Cuz Gavrila the clerk in the fire doesn't burn! Cuz got an ascended soul. - Well, drink, fellas, drink. - Drink, fellas. - Go to Korsan with Satan. - Fine. Polish Hetman there with the army. Spread the word among the Orthodoxy, that we're moving out with an army of 100000! - So the polacks tremble before our arrival! - Tremble. - So the Transnistrian Cossacks flew to us. - Flew to us. That's it! Just avoid the stake, clerk! Do not plunge me into grief. We love your sermons like vodka! The stake! - I entrust you, Thor, my child, Ivan. - Fine. Well, son, farewell. Otaman gave him a nickname: Dovbnya. - Well, goodbye, Satan. - Goodbye, old man. - Here, to remember me by. - Thank you. - Come on! Farewell, Thor! - Goodbye! Goodbye, boy! In the name of our Lord Jes... Kiss the cross, God's servant. - Good lad! - Good! Well, let's go! Oh, taran's great! Pity there's not enough vodka. Farewell, fellas! Farewell, all ye! Farewell! Soon you'll be lead by Khmelnitsky to fight with the Poles for your freedom and faith! Ho-ho! Look out! Cut the polack gentry down to the navel! And for that, you definitely get the kingdom of heaven! And if you cut polacks badly, all go to the hellfire! And there, oh Lord, jesuits and demons will cook bacon from you! And a bald demon is what you'll see instead of the paradise! Farewell! Farewell, ye sinners! Farewell, Zaporizhian Sich! Well, son, show what you can do. Well? What has the old Satan taught you? Well, nobody I can on. Well, come on with me! Well! - No, I'm afraid. - Do not worry, I'll be gentle! Nah, I'm afraid I'll break your ribs. Look, son, you see a cossack with a fife? Well that's Piven. He can kill a horse with a fist. Better not to touch him. Hey, Thor! Tell me, how many zloty had Khmelnitsky bought the mace for? Listen, Piven, I won't fist-fight you, but with the sabers. Let's go! And I want to try the fists. Just wish to! Hey! Let you and me fist-fight. And then you can try uncle Thor. Now come here, I'll put you down with one finger! That's just a kid. Dumb kid! Go, go. Now stop! I'm going to hurt you. Now. Here's for Khmelnitsky. And here's for Uncle Thor. Well? What's with you, stupid? Well, get up! Nah, finished. Oof, sorry I didn't get one in for myself! - Killed? - Nah... Come on, pull him down to the Dnieper, he'll come to. Quickly! Sonny, sonny, but who's the one who taught you that, huh? Dad. Five years Dad beat me. Vigorously. Until I'd learned. Then I let him have one, so he spent a month in bed. Ill he was. War council's beginning. Let's go. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Let's go to the council! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Let's go to the council! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Let's go to the council! Hail! Hail Bogdan! In the year 1648, day 18th, month of April we convened a council of Zaporizhian Sich! Upstairs, dragoons, quickly put out the signal! Get him! Take him alive! To the stake, schismatic! Cattle! Burning! Burning! Burning! See? Burning! Hail! 30000 polacks coming! 30000! Company! It's a force! They've got lots of cannons! Knights, dragoons! And us? We're only 6000! Consider this, company! We're only 6000 and only 1 coward! Come on, who else'll tell me that Zaporizhians have been afraid of polacks, knights, dragoons, demons, jesuits!? Come out! I can't hear! Company, polacks are coming. For many years I've lived. Many times asked Cossacks, but they either can't recall the old Dnieper spread out as wide as this spring. Take a look! Coasts are not visible! A sea! But it's not the melted snow nor the ice, it's the streams of people's tears that flew into Dnieper. It's the Ukrainian land that's no longer accepting blood, tears of tortured children, fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers of ours! (And the gentry blow their own trumpets about how they'll destroy kholops with fire & sword) You Maxim are a schismatic! Your knights are cattle! Me kholop contemptable! That's what Poland has given us! And took all, will, honor, life! Remember, Nalivaiko burned alive at the Copper Bull? - I remember! - We do! Look, knights, at skinned, severed heads of Khamlyuga, Remich? We remember! They, fine Cossacks, faithful Ukrainian sons, were bludgeoned to death on the wheel and had their veins pulled out from them while alive at the Warsaw square! Martyrs in the graves cry out to us for vengeance! So either we wait for a shameful death or go into battle for the fatherland, for freedom and honor, for the life of our nation! Under Zhovti Vody for the first battle and there we'll drive out lords and polacks from Ukraine until the very Riga! This place is known as Zhovti Vody. (Yellow Waters) - Permission, Hetman! - Speak. There are dragoons in 30 versts and a shoving raincloud of polacks. Let them shove. Their rainclouds will make light rain. - Permission, Hetman! - Speak. Helen? Go inside the tent. God! Why didn't the Cossacks kill me! God! Farewell, my husband. Farewell. The dawn is coming. But no Hetman. Chick in the camp is worse than the devil. She's going to bring bad luck. Hetman calls starshina to the council. Tell Hetman: where there's a woman there can be no council. C'mon, company. I will not allow anyone insult my wife! And I will not allow even the Hetman... That in the settlement, in our heart, an enemy! She cheated on you! And you've been blinded. Shut up! I will not shut up! Maxim, I love her. Can't be so, Maxim. Chaplinsky took Helen by force. What is her fault? Ah, by force! She's Polish. Can't be trusted. - A Polish woman will cheat. - All people are equal in the face of love. You hurt Hetman and before the fight too. Shame on you. Bogdan. Give me some tobacco, Maxim. Yours is stronger. Let's smoke... - What did you dream of this night? - I did not sleep. - And you, Lizogub? - Won't tell. Why not, do tell. Prophetic dreams come before the battle. Fine. Here's what I dreamed of: I went out of the tent. It's daylight outside. And the sun is dazzling. Beside the tent there sits an eagle. Spreads its mighty wings and looks directly at the sun. Long time. Suddenly there's rustling. Quietly a snake crawls to an eagle. The eagle does not notice it, spreads his wings, wanted to take off, but the snake jumped and... And why the hell were you standing still? But wait! It's a dream. Go on, Lizogub. The eagle's fallen. And the rest I don't want to talk about. Speak! Well, I walk up to the eagle and suddenly everything's vanished. Disappeared. Instead of the eagle there's you, Bogdan. Dead. Shut up! And instead of a snake above you - Maxim Krivonos. Shut up! That's it. But this is only a dream. Imagined. Bad dream before the battle. I did not want to tell. - The sun rises. - The sun rises. Hey, Churin! Bring ? here. Play the pre-battle! - Permission, Hetman? - Speak. - They've got upwards of a 50 cannons. - I know. And we've got 8. It'll be hard for us, Hetman. 50 cannons, that's the force! Only one solution: Someone goes to the polack settlement, as if to accidentally get captured, ...and there under torture show that all our cavalry and Tatars are not in this forest, but there. That's when the polacks are going to face most of the cannons towards that forest, we strike in the back and cut off the cannons. Polacks won't do this, polacks won't put cannons that way! They will. Honest to god, they will! So do send me, Khmel, to the polack camp. Never. Oh! Khmel! Khmel! - Hetman... - Well? - And did you know that I haven't had a fear of fire since the early age? - I did not. Listen, is the value of me alone great? I would gladly accept a painful death, if that was even a small help to fatherland. Let me go, Khmel. Well, let me go! Well, Khmel, let the old cossack laugh at polack gentry. ??? demon children, when we strike at them from the woods! Let me go, Hetman, let me go! Well, the hell do you need me, an old demon, here for? After all, we'll be able to save our regiments. And we have but a few. - So stay healthy, Hetman! - Old man! .. Oh, yeh, I forgot. Here's a souvenir. Farewell! Oh, will I have a laugh over the polack gentry! Ride immediately to Stefan Potocki and warn him that Khmelnitsky sent cossack Thor to him. - And if they won't believe, and start torturing? - They'll believe. Ride right now! Otherwise Khmelnitsky can win the battle and then we're done! Ride faster! Allow me, Hetman! Cannons were put right in front of us and on the sides! Bad news you've brought. They did not believe the old man. Pity. What a cossack died tortured and for nothing. Well, will you tell the truth? How many tatars and cossacks waiting in the woods? Tell, khlop! I've already said, the Tatars are 8000, cossacks are 3000 in that forest... to the right... Tell the truth! Say, khlop! Say, khlop! Burn him! With fire! I'm dying, telling the truth. 8000 tatars, 3000 cossacks. In the woods to the right. - Seems khlop's telling the truth. - We have to move the cannons to face the forest. - Khlop's baked. - What'd he say before he died? Same repeated. Forty cannons facing the woods! - Well? - Good saber master has got! I gave my word of honor to Lady Helen, that the first Zaporizhian whom my eyes shall see, will be decapitated with this saber! Master already given the chance. - A horse! - Gentlemen, here to see you! I beseech you, stand still! - I give up! - Pull out the saber, khlop! Pull out the saber, khlop! - But I'm yours, gentlemen! - I in the name of Lady Helen! Dziekuje, gentlemen, for giving me an opportunity to fulfill the promise given to Lady Helen. And where's his saber? He fought me like the devil! But I knocked his sword out of his hands with a special move! Allow me, Hetman! Poles are moving their cannons to face the wood! Eternal glory to cossack Thor. Everyone, here! You, Opanas, lead yours to the left. Come around there! Swoop with the cavalry! And take that corner. - Fine. - You, Bogun, stay closer to the center and cut off the cannons by any means. - You, Maxim... - Right in the center! - Fine! - Fine. Remember, there isn't anywhere to await help from. Won't leave anyone but a 100 cossacks and squires here. Last one before the battle! Oh, woe is me! Oh, woe is me! - Hey, godmother, why are you crying? - What have you lost? Children of mine, give it to those polacks... And I need to see Stefan Potocki. Ooh need, need, need! - Hey, godmother! - Huh? What d'you want Stefan Potocki for, huh? I need to, he's been kissing me here and there! To the cross! Schismatics! Cattle! Oh, you bandit! Scurvy sons! ??? - Pig! - Pig! Come out, scum! ??? Come out! Here is where you shoot! Here is where you shoot! When will the messenger from Stefan arrive? Stefan has a surprise in store for us, doesn't send messengers. I can not wait any longer. When will Stefan arrive? Oh, do not worry, Master Stefan destroyed Khmelnitsky and will soon arrive here. Traitor Khmelnitsky sent two Cossacks from Zaporozhye. They've spread a rumor that he's he's got 100000 armed khlops! - They were caught. If you like, I'll show them to you. - Yes, yes. If my guests so desire, I will show the first two Zaporizhian prisoners Will consider it a great fortune, Hetman, if you allow to interrogate khlops here. I'll untie their tongues in 3 minutes. Good day, cattle. Robbers, schismatics! On your knees before the reverent Hetman. On your knees! Silence! I'll hack you up! Cattle! - You what? - Nice castle, but full of fleas! Ah, there's one biting. But they've conspired! I've been bitten by a flea. They've spread in here! Gotta squash them. Finish schismatics, finish them! Oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh! Biting. It's nothing, soon Khmel will be brought here, all the fleas will die! What?! Sgotsky! Hide it. Hide the sword. It's not how you talk to them. - Listen, khlops ... - Yes, master? Tonight you'll be tortured with hot iron. - And tomorrow you'll be placed on high stakes. - On high ones? - Yes! - Well, well, well, well ... - So we see from the windows, how you dance. - Well, sir, all right. - Stakes will slowly move through you... - Well, well, well, well... - Only towards the evening they will come out through the throat. - Through the throat? - Yes! - Ayayayay. Got it? Got it... Hetman. Thank you for your kindness. Here's a conversation khlops understand and are even grateful for. You have a good heart, reverent Hetman. Good heart. Indulge us sinners before death in a request. Ask. Order them to put us on the low stakes. Why the low? Why? One way or another they will come out through the throat. No, reverent master. If we are going to sit on low stakes, then you, reverent Hetman, and all of your gentry will have an easier time kissing our naked asses. Hold it! For this they will die a cruel death. Cruel! Instead of sabers. Khlop. Schismatic! Cattle! It's not you who beat us, but him. Your khlop sold his soul to devil, lied under torture til death, and deceived us. You lie! If you were scorched so with fire as old Thor, you would have sold the whole of Poland! You are not worthy to kiss such khlop's feet! Take off the hats before cossack Thor! Well?! - Let me go! - No! - Let go! - Wait, cattle! Let go, Hetman. Who are you? I'm a zaporozhian cossack Piven... Let go! Military scribe Lizogub sent me to warn you of great trouble. Jesus Maria! Khmelnitsky chopped up your army on Zhovti Vody. - And my son? Stefan? - Killed by the hand of Bogun. You lie! Khmelnitsky defeated, he sent him here, so we retreated and escaped mob could leave volast. What have you got to prove that you're telling the truth? - I brought a sign from Lizogub. - Come on, come on. Well, release me. - Let go. - Let go. What does this mean? Don't know. What does this mean? Don't know. So. Tie him up and to the stake. But I brought a sign from Lizogub! To the stake. To the stake, khlop! You'll absolve your sins on the stake. But I brought a sign from Lizogub! Out! What was the sign? Couldn't make out. Hetman, stop! Khmelnitsky's cavalry! What? What did you say? - Khmelnitsky's cavalry in 20 versts. - What? Ah... yes. Yes. Khmelnitsky ran away and wants to break through here. Everyone to the troops! Get out! To the troops! Give me armor and a sword. Well! Ayayayay. And how did Stephen let Khmelnitsky slip away? Well, it's nothing, nothing. I'll lasso him. What? What?! - Well, yes ... Pray for the victory. - No. What? What?! God punished us for our sins. - Khlop said... - Get on your knees. Pray for my son. Khlop told the truth. My son! My son! Stefan! Go to the troops, Hetman! Lord, what shall I say to my knights? Give me strength, Lord. Teach. - With Fire and Sword. - With Fire and Sword. With Fire and Sword! With Fire and Sword! With Fire and Sword, khlops! With Fire and Sword! Why tarry, Hetman? Let me work! Narrow ? goes! Why tarry, Bogdan? Time! - Horse! - Horse! Stop! Bogun, Maxim, look! Look! Ah!..Now I'll annihilate your cannons without casualties! Dziekuje... gentlemen! More! Bogun! Come on! Hoorah! Maxim! Come on! Hoorah! 10103! 10104! 10105! Don't count, clerk. I'm tired. A sinner you are, Satan. Great sinner! Hetman, give reinforcements to Bogun. A horse for me! Dangerous, Hetman! If even one schismatic touches our castle, I'm going to hang you, colonel! Reverent Hetman, I demand to send a messenger to Warsaw. We can not be taken, but will be besieged and starved to death. Coward! Coward! Coward! - Bogdan! - Assault! Everyone assault! - Bogdan! - Come on, come on, come on, come on! Bogun, and so even demons become scared. Fill the ditch up with corpses of polacks and corpses of masters! - Will do! - Come on! His Serene Highness Khan Islam Giray Khan ordered to assist, ours won't assault the castle! Such was our agreement. Thank you for your help. You fought like lions! We're about to assault! 11904...11905! - Stop! Oh! - Strengthen body weakness in prayer. Repeat. - Lord! - Lord! - Send master Potocki! - Send master Potocki! - In the belly. - In the belly. - In the heart! - In the heart. - In the liver! - In the liver. - Demons! - Demons. - How much? - How much? 11906! - 11907! - Send, Lord! Retribution to masters! Retribution to masters! Retribution to masters! Retribution to masters! Krivonos! * Prays in Polish * 17002! (Chorus) 17003! - Glory! Glory! - Glory! Shoot! Shoot! Hit the masters! - Gavrila! - Dad! - Alive? - Alive! I appoint you priest of our troops! Scribe! Scribe! Are pipes playing or it's just my fancy? - Fancy. - No, no. Do you hear? Our surnas. Opanas! Opanas! Look! We won! Glory to us! Glory to us! Lady Helen, I brought you a gift from Warsaw, from the Order of jesuits. The holy fathers remember about you. - What's in the locket? - You're supposed to give Hetman the wine and press here over his cup. - And in the cup shall flow... - Poison. I know. Khmelnitsky dies immediately and I'm caught. Well, why why why why, Lady Helen! He'll fall sick for ten days and you'll leave tomorrow for Warsaw. - Khmelnitsky won't die right away? - I swear to you before God! For ten days he shall be sick. Holy Church expects a feat from you. Its order cannot be unfulfilled! I wish to escape from here. Press here for the sake of our order. *Reads Latin* For the glory of thou ancestors, thou glorious win over your adversary... ??? Glory to immortals! Crowned be the glory! Because in the sky they don't give vodka. And will you? I will! Vodka? No, not vodka! Pay, Holy Father! But no money, sinner! Boys! No money! Here's what, harlot! Give me vodka and I'll absolve you all sins! And who'll absolve my sins with you, Holy Father? Huh? Oh, Devil into the soul! A witch! Lucifer's daughter! Harlot! Ram's navel! Me? Ram's navel? Oh you deacon! Pig's belly! Hey! I'm crying! Will you give me vodka, harlot? Ah! Crying! Crying, but paying! - What you doing? - What? My uncle has just been caught and taken to the fortress to be tortured! Bogun, order his immediate release! And stop making decisions by yourself! Don't be hasty. It was me who ordered your uncle taken to the castle and questioned. I'm curious: why does a messenger from Warsaw visit him, why do you? - And how come military scribe Lizogub is acquainted with him. - What? - Lies! - When I've checked, then I'll see. - Lies! - Run! Run before Khmelnitsky's not here. And the locket? Ah! Crying! You lost it, father! Will now smoke from this ???. ???, will die anyway! Won't give you! And won't give you! Won't give to anyone! - You will, honeybun, you will! - Will not! Will not? Huh! Boys! Draw out pistols! Boys! Extinguish the candles! Come on! Come on! Come on, boys! Shoot here! Shoot! Now here! Now here! Now there! Come, Holy Father, stop the mass. Bogun! Bogun, where's Helen? Why wasn't she there to meet us? - Not sick? - Healthy. Well, call her. I will and I'll ask her something in your presense. Hetman! Our Father Gavrila's being cashiered out there on the square! Good people! The clerk of our troops, father Gavrila, was appointed priest of Zaporizhian troops by the Hetman in the battle of Korsun. Unholy power seduced him. He served the first God's service and that same night drank away his clerical robe, for which he will be beaten mercilessly by sticks. I told you so. Eh, my friend! So ruled the cossack court. Anyone who drinks a glass of vodka, is to hit three times. Let's start, orthodox ones, to beat the demon out of this sinful body with the sticks. Ah, sinful Gavrila! Your eyes behold vodka and you are treated to the sticks. Good stick! Say farewell to ribs, priest. Sinners! Look at the sky! What do you see? (People) Nothing. And you don't deserve to see! Mother of God, sorrowfully watching me. The Holy nurse! For the sins of the Zaporizhian Sich I accept the torment! Huh? Listening! Aha! Well, well, well, well... Good cossack! Good cossack! Sinners! Which one of you hasn't drunken away pants and shirts, go ahead and start thrashing my sinful body! But if one of you is a proudling, who'll lie, then he'll end up in the blazing inferno! - I haven't! - Oh, my death! - Dovbnya too. - Oh, Lord! Allow me, Hetman. Mother of God! Untie him, Dovbnya. He didn't make much of a priest, but he's a fine cossack. Do you hear? What were father's orders? ...He's standing, oaf! Shave the beard, Gavrila, and come to me. I'll appoint you centurion! How have you lived here without me? I waited for you. Gavrila! Oh! What? What? Eh, you fool! What Gavrila! Eh, Gavrila! What a cossack! Heh, that's a cossack! I'm a cossack! - Hold it! - But I'm Gavrila, Gavrila, come on! Hetman's waiting for me. To your visit, my lover. But drink it up. I never drink half. Don't drink, Hetman! Don't drink! - She poured poison into the cup! - You lie! Matka Boska, Bogdan, they all hate me! They want to kill me! I poured the poison? Give me your cup, Bogdan, I'll drink up and go away. Ah! Viper! Gavrila, go away! I won't! Father, she'll poison you! Go away, you're drunk! Father! Go away, I'll kill you! Ah, Khmel, Khmel. No need for killing! Huh, growing pale? Tell him whos lying, me or you? Who gave you the poison, tell, Catholic! Who da...? Take her, keep her safer than your eyes. I'll come to her. Ah, viper! Ah, viper! Helen, run. Run, run! It's cold. Father, that's farewell, father. Father, have a drink for sinner Gavrila. And be kind, father, put a stone on my grave, and write the following words: "Sinner Gavrila loved Zaporizhian Sich. Loved our God, and still love vodka and the bargirl. Drink for his sinful soul." Father, beat the masters on the Earth, and I will in the sky. ...alive? Not so fast, Lizogub. Sold your soul to jesuits! Wanted to poison Hetman! - Polish priest revealed under torture, he's sold out. - Not true! I am not to blame! I'm facing you with clear conscience! The priest could not say anything! - I swear! - I swear to God! Good Lord! Look upon my sorrow and grief! Why are you allowed to cover the Earth with a plague in cassocks? Plague! Plague covered the Earth! And in the jesuits' footsteps death moves invisible! Tell me, my colonels. More than once have you met with death, battle-grayed. Tell me, knights, is there in the world retribution for the tortures of our people? But where, where is the limit of suffering? Bow your heads. For the last time over a great heart by betrayal killed. In your coffin, Gavrila, I put my heart as well. From now on, my heart is gone from my chest. From now on, inhuman hatred is beating in my chest instead of the heart. Over your cold forehead, Gavrila, I swear, you'll soon hear, how heavens shake from our vengeance! Retribution to the masters! Tombs shall cover the steppe! Reverent King knows, that you, Khmelnitsky, as a loyal subject to the King, shall immediately begin negotiations. For this His Mercy forgives you and your army your guilts before the PRC. Take the banner of our king and be humbled. Accept. Accept. We are inordinately comforted by your victories and the beginning of a release from the Latvian yoke. Take the letter of His Tsar Majesty. In it Sovereign joyfully answers your letter. And he awaits your ambassadors in Moscow. You know Adam Kisel, Hetman. You've known me for a long time. Bogun. Bogun! King shall forgive insults the whole army. - Look, I'm an Orthodox like you. - The hell are you bothering me? Wish you'd burn. Hetman! King with the Polish Army broke into Volhynia! We're falling back! Shut up! Know, Hetman, the king announced a Pospolitian movement! Today it's Volhynia burning, and tomorrow the king's army will be here! And flame... Start talking another talk, Hetman! Or it'll be too late! Too late?! For whom?! For whom! Today I'm going for your king! Today! Now! Go to you without cannons. I'll get cannons in your king's camp. I'll drive out all the princes and tooks(?) from our land! Drive you out to Vistula. Will camp over Vistula and will stay day and night. I'll say, "Sit down, be quiet!" And if you'll make noise there and there I will get you. Now go and tell it to your king. Hold it! Listen. It's Kiev revolting! Glory to the Russian people, our brother, who gave us a hand in a terrible fight. Soon the day will come, brother shall join brother, and shall not exist a power that could break us. And shall not exist a power that could break us.
