THE CRIME OF THE WEEK All right, Ben, what's the big idea? Drag me into the middle of nowhere to look at the bottom of a hole! I'm going back to the car. So on November 21st. Benjamin Willis of Ogden, Utah, killed his unfaithful wife, Eleanor. Willis was sure he had committed the perfect crime. But he was wrong. In the next "Crime of the week", presented by "Colonial Cigarettes" we'll reveal the full story of the Willis case. Colonial is everyone's favorite cigarette brand... No. 1, put yourself in your position. ... according to a formula designed for the last cigarette of the day, give the feeling of freshness from the first day of the day. Attention, on number 1! No. 2, frame the poster. All cigarette manufacturers buy good tobacco, They have modern factories, but the difference between a good cigarette And the best cigarette is the difference in experience. It's not enough to buy good tobacco, you need to buy the best, Who doesn't scratch his tongue. Know how to choose well... Hey mom dad is great this week, right? Two crimes! Silence! The commercial is the most important. ... the pleasure of smoking. Compre "Colonial", tente "colonial", and will smoke colonial, always. Attention two... camera two. Within 8 days, "The crime of the week" will make you discover, the smallest details, do caso Willis. We close with a black closure. Finished! Another one in your pocket! How have you been? Well Don, what do you say? Nothing bad. You wrote this. And that and everything you do "A great Dave Markson production!" We take care of the smallest detail. The woman was not carrying a bag. Calm down, Henry. It doesn't matter. I think everything is in order. Another success! Mom, can we go see the mine? Yes, but be careful. I hope the kids enjoyed it. Barney, was that tie needed? Willis wore sportswear that day. It doesn't matter, Henry. Of course there is, I take care of the most precise details. This is my obligation. What do sponsors think? A great script, darling. As if you like that. You could write better things than these crimes. Children, come here! Um fast food? Yes, in the little French restaurant. I should be back early for the conference... Dad! Are you coming with us to dinner at the restaurant? Of course my dear. But then I have to get back to work. Mom will come home with you later. - Dad, can I see the gun? - Sure, go ask Jake. Daddy, are you coming to dinner at the restaurant? Will you be back at 10? Yes, I must have certainly finished by now. Don't be long. - Hi Henry - Hi Louise An excellent chapter. Tell the sponsors, please. Don't let Don be too late. - See you in ten minutes, OK? - He is well. Is it a Webley? Look, Jimmy, all I know is, when they shoot this show, somebody's going to die. Our actors are never wrong. Jimmy, come on! - Bye, Jake! - Bye, Jimmy! One of our best shows! Did you like it? Yes, Dave. But who cares about extra expenses? And what do you say, Everett? Great, Dave, but... Okay, so go ahead with the autopsy. Come with me! What else do you want? Leary and Kenny offer "colonial" on a variety show. If you cancel the sponsorship, my agency loses as much as you. And I will have to look for a job. Our option expires in three weeks. The next show will be fulminating, Even if I have to kill for it! Oh Don. What did Louise tell you? Give me a hand, Henry. I told Louise I would be working because I have to see my brother and she doesn't like it. I didn't want to upset her. Do something for me, Henry. Of course, count on me. Thanks. The next three programs will terrify 14 million viewers. The script about Jordan is unimpressive. I've been sweating for 8 days. And nothing, does not come out. Henry, me sirva um bourbon, - do you want one? - No thank you. The Jordan case offered a number of possibilities. Some of these crimes are exciting. I should have done the killing more dramatically. I know you're exhausted, Don. Don't think about the "crime of the week" anymore. See you tomorrow night at eight. Louise is waiting for me. Will you review the text on Friday? For Friday, yes. Mr. Markson, sir. How sensitive are these writers! For some time Don is very nervous. It's no fun writing a screenplay every week. Dave... If I share the work, Don would have two weeks to write. Would it be worth it? For the sake of the program. Everyone must have noticed that Don... Myself: poor boy, with his problems. What type of problem? I thought everyone knew that! Bah, Louise and he will get over it. We will have our option. Good night, Mr. Hayes. What delayed you? I'll tell you already. Where did we have dinner tonight? In my house. I expected us to leave. Talk better in my apartment. I have to talk to you about your next role. Thanks. ...that's why the protagonist will give it to you. I'll tell everyone to watch the show. A golden paper for you, Paula. Just what we were waiting for. And will Dave agree? I know how to handle Dave Markson. Why has Cathy been the lead for three weeks? It was not my fault. She was the woman the role demanded. I know you do what you can... but falling into a mine, What glory! What do you think of Cezanne? Oh, exciting! A very new spatial concept. Yes indeed. You will learn a lot in a few months. Now you know how to distinguish impressionism from surrealism. I appreciate everything you've done for me. You are way above the guys in the study. Don't worry about the studio ones. You are worth much more than all of them. You and I are way above them... and we'll prove it soon. You will get the roles you deserve. And my talent will be recognized. I will make a lot of money. Yes, let's not forget the money. It's wonderful. Sou? You know it is. I'm sorry I'm leaving. But... we've barely finished dinner. Didn't I tell you? I'm sorry I have to go. Where you go? For an audition for the summer in "The Captain". Tonight? Who selects the cast? Paul Matthews. Tomorrow morning I will call him from my office. The agency wants to see me tonight, Henry. Okay, I follow you. I know the guys at the agency. I don't think it's appropriate. Why not? that they see me with you? Henry, I didn't mean that. But what kind of night is this? I was hoping to spend time with you... It's okay that you found it, but you don't own me. No, I'm not, Paula. But I never got around to it. You understand the situation, right darling? Sorry, Henry. Thanks for the wonderful dinner and everything. The picture is adorable. Thanks good night. Good night. I call you. Of course you won the races, darling. I call you. Good night, thanks again. Come on, Marco... Get out. Come in, the door is open! Come sit down. I'll get you a drink. Why did you make me come? We have nothing to talk about. Of course yes. We have a lot to say. There is no lack of topics. I already broke up with you when we got back from Tahoe. It's over, Paula. No more love... No more money. And don't call me back at the studio. You think you know all the answers. And you don't even know the questions! For example, Paula? For example, Donald? For example... Do you recognize this? Yes I lost in Tahoe. What you do with him? You didn't miss it, darling. Upon returning from Tahoe, okay, during your big farewell scene, you were in the kitchen looking for something to drink. So I got my "insurance policy". Her pajamas were on top of everything. You can find the same, no matter where, for five dollars. But yours is worth 2,500 with your beautiful name sewn inside. Me exhibits. You're kidding, of course! It's safe. And for sale. times 2 ... 5 ... 0 ... 0 ... You didn't think this was cheating, did you? You will not blackmail me. I'll tell my wife everything. Oh no you wouldn't do that to your wife. If you could avoid it any other way. Oh no? When she finds out that it was all over last summer... I would like to see her convincing from last summer! And what did you come up with for tonight? I barely have those 2,500 in total. But you have them. And if I pay, will I have pajamas? When you pay, We will exchange. Don't forget to wrap it. I'm sorry to do this to you, but his gifts ran out too quickly. When we stumble across TBC, Surely you wouldn't think it was casual, at least. A screenwriter as subtle as you. Okay, Paula... You win. Give me a few days. Till Friday. Nine o `clock pm. I will be waiting. I'm surprised you're still alive! I know how to choose my partners. None of them have the courage to do anything drastic. Good night, Mr. Newell. Max... pour me a double whiskey! How could I let myself go like this? Why did I go so far not to get out? Because I didn't know how to judge Paula Ranier from day one, How did she have me? Sorry, did I hurt you? Of course not. Don Newell! Enchanted. I finally find him. It's funny to have known him this way. I am Paula Ranier. I always dreamed of interpreting an article written by you. Oh! Thank you! What about Henry Hayes? You should hire her now. It's impossible to see Henry Hayes! Are you going to the cafeteria? My story is regrettable. Would you listen to her? At least in the cafeteria, I get what I want. Naturally, I accompanied her. I was flattered. I liked her dress That didn't cover much. Certainly an accident... An innocent! If Louise hadn't gone to Tahoe, if I hadn't been so disoriented, if I hadn't "stumbled" with Paula... What's wrong with having a drink. This is not something that compromises anyone. At least I thought so. I'm delighted you are out of town. I'm not prejudiced against married men. Many of my best friends are married. I too, so to speak, am married. - I'm separated from Fred Abbott. - Abbott? The exact type of unstable adventurer. I like peaceful men like you. With real talent. Henry Hayes gave him a small paper, and Paula was careful to thank me. For my part, I was delighted about it. Really delighted. Even the cat seemed well educated. He hung up on time. The gift was ready to be opened. And I opened it. I didn't realize what was to come when on a Sunday. in the afternoon I went to Santa Barbara for lunch. When I could still back away from it all. Don, could you lend me $50? I haven't paid my rent yet. I will return it to you within eight days. Okay, let's eat at a drive-in... 50... then 100... and which quickly became a habit, one that I couldn't break. Without breaking this so sweet I had and it made me feel so good. I went to Tahoe for a weekend with my family. I almost didn't dare look at Louise. You leave me lying for a whole week and now you come and declare it's all over. I just told you, just. I don't understand it. We knew it wouldn't last A little futureless fantasy. I won't see you again, Paula. It's just like that! You had your fun and now you go home. We've had enough, right? "We had"? Well, it's not worth getting angry, don't you think? I'm glad you saw it that way. What's done is done. How about one last drink for the old days? Paula, what have you... Please just one for me. And then goodbye. Just what I wanted! Goodbye... Paula. "Bye... Paula" "Bye," she said. Did you call me sir? No. Bring me the bill. Today I attended the bar, huh? I am not sleeping. - Hello dear. - Hi. - Have you been doing well? - Yes of course. I love you. I love you too. Is something wrong, darling? Are you sure? Come soon... I'm cold! You should like this, Henry! - A hundred times better. - And what's the secret? I'm learning to love the common. Yes, it's a good script, normal. Why do you censor him? Don't take this the wrong way, Don. It is in the interest of the program. Yes, yes... OK... But...? It's flat. Characters are predictable. Henry, take care of your work with the cast, I'll write the texts. Good. Let's see the details. Page 15, you talk about a wristwatch. Jordan carried it in his waistcoat pocket. See police photos. Very precise! It doesn't matter, if the scene works. We do "realism". Viewers want to see the crime. As if they were there. Smell the stench. They love it! And all our success comes from there. It's an obsession! Never mind the name... Okay, it's an obsession. Do we reproduce the crimes, yes or no? People like children, details about all those poor victims. The shade of a lipstick, the book you read, silk stockings, the favorite song, the jewels... Thank you, Mr. Hayes! - Do you want to see another error? - Yea. Well, listen well. In the background image... let the car off Battery street and stop at the bakery? Then? Battery is a one-way street... in the other direction. This is important, Don. Well, Dave, I get it. Here it is, Mr. Newell, In three checks. 500 from your child's account, 500 from your daughter and 1,500 from you. - Where do I have to sign? - Here. "Donald Newell for his son James Newell." The same for your daughter. Credit unions lament losing customers. They prefer to see them open accounts saving for their children's future. I know, but it's necessary. They will certainly enjoy a long vacation. Yes, more than I thought. Wait a minute, I'll call her. A call, Miss Ranier. From who? A man. Very well about having changed everything. So it looks bigger. Very elegant. Thanks. Come back later. Who is it? Who do you think I am? Your husband, Mrs Abbott! Did the police let you cross the border? You think you are very funny, right? Paula, I have to see you. What are you doing in town? You better disappear! I don't want anything from you. Paula, listen to me... What if I told Miller about the coup? With that your mink got paid, right? What a coincidence! Skirt! You don't tell me anything. See you tonight. I will not be here. Don't waste your time. I will go now. You should know by now, Don... I think I can come in? What are you doing here? I already told you on the phone I was busy. An audition on "El Capitan"? Do not argue. Go away. And who is this famous Don? I know him? It's nothing important! - And besides, you don't mind. - I have a right to know. Since when? I feel sick because of your spying. I would like to try to help you. All I want is for you to have somewhere. That you know more than knowing how to dress. Forgive me if I don't know how to appreciate this. "I'm going to make a great actress, Paula!" "You will have a role for you!" I did everything I could. Of course you did. But it wasn't enough. It's a shame I'm leaving town. Are you leaving? Where? For how long? Forever. I already have what I wanted. Nothing ended between us. - Yes, what's over is over. - Nothing's over. Do not say that. Paula, we understand each other so well. You don't have what I want. And you will never have it. But you took my money. And everything else. I have one more thing to offer you. You earn 150 a week! I still don't write "The Crime of the Week" But very soon I will. What? And I will get 500 a week. What is so funny? It seems. You writing the show! You will be no more than a ladder to others. A little guy with a little job. "Below the others", You said yourself. And it always will be. Taking care of your little details. And it will be a great pleasure for me to say goodbye. You're not leaving! You hurt me. I leave you, California, and everything. I won't let you. You understand, don't you? Or do you want me to spell it out? You nasty old little man. I leave you delighted. A guy like you. The great brain, who knows art, music, who has read everything! As far as I'm concerned you're despicable and low. Didn't you see I was making fun of you? A girl should be dying to love you! You have only small roles to offer me. Do you think you are a Don Juan or what? Come back dear. Cliffie, stay here. There is a lot of space. Every minute with you was hell! You dirty bitch... Okay, get out! Skirt! And don't write me. You see... I try to join the party. I have fun. Come on dear. I need to talk to you, please. You can't leave the party like this. You are not a cop to stop me. Go get a drink, It'll make you happy. - Let's go to the terrace. - No, wait a moment, come back. And you that Madeleine? She's the kind of girl someone invites just to complete the table! Come on, come on... She tells me I'm a professional... Okay... I'm going back to the party. You can always try to make me drink. but don't even say hello to me again. You finished? Sim. Come on. Marco, what are you doing? Hey Paul where are you going? Look at her. Paul is not his name... Hey, Charlie? Paul or Charlie, come have a drink. Stay... Don't go. The party is just getting started. I'm sorry... Another day. This damn record is driving me crazy! I like classical music but this... is awesome! What about the two of us getting out of here? Thanks. I'm sorry I have to go. Paul, don't be an idiot! I love you Charlie! Stay, Charlie. I have to go. All right, Charlie. Never mind... He drank too much! Let's get back to the party. Hello Mr. Newell I already serve you. The tag... They'll find it. They will know that Paula was blackmailing me. They will say I killed her. I was stupid to say that I worked with Henry tonight! What can I do... what can I say? Do you want to kill yourself? Hey, be careful! Special edition! "Wife kills blonde lover." Who would say? Newspaper, sir? Extra, extra... All the details about the crime! Take care! Don't appreciate your life? Friend, is everything alright? Are you okay? Yes I'm fine. Go home to sleep and it will pass. Spirit! Turn around! Serve. - That's not mine! - He is well. Look, I wasn't the one who strangled her! We'll see it soon. - Can I call? - No. There's nothing to condemn me. Hello? Very good. I do not know... Thanks. In the suitcase you left at the terminal We found an insurance policy. You are eavesdroppers. You make 90 a week working in an aviation office, huh? However, you pay an insurance policy for Paula. It's an old policy from when we lived together. Come on! $10,000 is enough as a crime motive! Tranque-o. On the march! But do you want to hear me? Yeah, let's get going. Is he the killer? The husband? Yes, he is. Thank you for your help. - All ready? - We're done. All reports in my office. Do you already have what you need? It is ideal as "Crime of the Week". For television? Of course, and for the covers. We still don't have the culprit. You just accused Abbott. Abbott foi "preso". Why this interest in the case, Henry? It's the typical case of "The Crime of the Week" Exciting, new. Who everyone talks about. If you don't help me, your captain will be happy to do so. I did not say that! But... did you know the bird? Sure. Interpreted some things for the studio. We found lots of links from her for you. And for all casting directors, of course. What was she like as an actress? I had many other talents in another area. How dare you say that? Did you know her, sir? I knew her. Don't look at me with that look. I change sidewalks when I see a policeman. It is true that she has had many men. Who are you to dare judge her? She was the way she was. You are perfect? Paula Ranier had a heart of gold! I know what men thought of her! Did any of my agents bother you? I'll clean this place when you get out of here. I'm going to have a cold beer. We're done for now. If I can be of use to you, tell me something. I will need some details for the transmission. Between us... it was Abbott, right? We are friends, Henry, so I can tell you. She had many men. Abbott had both the motive and the opportunity. - And the other men? - Perhaps. That night there was a very lively party next door. The manager received three complaints. Anyone could have done it. We are following other leads. What is it? People and their gum. When will I have the photos? As soon as they're ready. This early morning there was a collision between four cars. There were no victims... Are you going to hear the news all the time? You haven't done more than that all morning. The body of Paula Ranier, television artist... You are only interested in crimes. Do not touch! Fred Abbott, husband of the actress, He was arrested. He admitted to going to see her last night but he swore he was innocent. According to police, The result is imminent. Where you go? I bother you, So I'm going for a walk. no honey stay here I'm sorry I know I'm hateful. It certainly is. But that's over. Look at me. I adore you! Why didn't you marry someone in your profession? Because I married you. Dear darling! Don't do this to me again. No my love. I didn't know where I was going. But now it's all over. I am happy that you deposit this money again. I feel like your vacation has been cancelled. I prefer to stay here and work. Interest out, lost, but still at the same point as before. You were absolutely right. They are waiting for you. Why did you make me come here? What do you think of all this? I am not aware of the case. It's the best idea we've ever had on the show! The guarantee of success! And they don't want to know anything about it. Let's see ... It is you who will write. What do I have to write about? We need an impact for the next issue. And what we have doesn't work. And I have a brilliant idea. This will take you directly to the dungeon. Forget the Jordan case. You need something sensational. The case of Paula Ranier. It is impossible from a legal point of view. We take care of it. Abbott was not convicted. Wow! What am I going to write? He was accused. It's enough for us. And we'll always have the Jordan case at hand. Now I begin to understand: Henry made a discovery... Don't touch it, Dave. It's morbid. An artist from our studios... We absolutely need to protect the "Colonial" account! I have the support of the police. - And the permits? - I'll have them. Dave, everyone will be talking about us! We'll take care of the program right away. Find out if we can film there. Betsy, chame o Sr. Weatherby. Who is he? I think he can help us a lot. Thank you for helping us. Sirs... Mr. Weatherby, trustee of Paula Ranier's estate. Dave Markson, producer. Mel Gilbert, attorney. Don Newell, screenwriter. It's a pleasure, gentlemen. Mr. Weatherby, we decided to run the show in this case. If you allow us to film in the apartment. At the agreed price? Yes, Mr. Gilbert will take care of it. Very good. It's a horrible situation, of course, but since the damage is done... Mr. Newell, isn't it? That. I think we met, Mr. Newell. From the Thompsons' party? I do not believe. Everything must be done in good taste. Clear. Okay, Dave. I will sign the agreement with Mr. Weatherby. Thanks again, Mr. Weatherby. Will you keep me posted on everything? With pleasure. Thanks for coming here. Goodbye. Goodbye. Don't worry, Mr. Newell, I never forget a face. I will remember! Ben, I have nothing more to tell you. He must have seen you at the apartment. Why not admit it? What does this mean, Henry? We all knew about Paula Ranier. You sent it to my office yourself. I knew her a little. Is that? That maybe you could have known her better. This will be difficult, but you will make it. - What will you need, Henry? - Here I have some elements. "Colonial" will renew his contract I'm convinced. These are the interrogations carried out in the apartment. Stevens Statements... By the way, we'll have to take care of Lieutenant Stevens. The pictures. What do I know about Fred Abbott. Notes about a stranger, "the other man". What Abbott swears is the murderer. Maybe there you can upload the ideas. Surely the ideas will come to you. OK. See you again on Wednesday. He doesn't look very excited. No, it looks very cold. And this is not good. We cannot allow this to sabotage the script. Say it again. Dave... Why can't I take care of the text? Just to be sure. I could do this with my eyes closed! Without effort! "Crime of the Week" Paula Ranier case. By Don Newell. First sketch. "Crime of the Week" Case Paula By Don Newell. First draft. Dinner: Ranier apartment. Day... Apartment 801 in a new building. Modern furniture, very attractive set, big couch by the window, A phone on the right. Have you ever seen decorated so good? These drawings are very good. Let's not forget the outdoors. I want the ones from the day before yesterday. "Colonial" will renew the contract, I assure you, Don. Did we just cut it half a page? This makes the "other man" more mysterious. Magnificent How do you talk to Paula? Whereas we can keep all dialogues. Many children watch the show. What does Henry think? By the way, where are you? Trying to perfect the masterpiece I gave him a copy. Lieutenant Stevens on line one. How is everything my dear inspector? Hi Markson. You might want to know the news: let's charge Abbott. They got Abbott! Wonderful, Mike! Thank you for your help. Could you let me watch the show? With pleasure. Do you want to have dinner with me on Wednesday before it starts? Magnificent. And a thousand thanks again. He doesn't know if he's going to charge Abbott. - Will you file a complaint? - I am thinking about it. don't tell me you love television There is something very strange about this. No programa, Markson? Paula Ranier only dreamed of TBC. He called TBC more than anyone else. Anyone who knew her knew that... could escape from anything. Voluntarily? A cigarette, Ted. This will be our best production. Well I will make these changes. In this business you have to know how to risk it! "O caso Paula Ranier", por Henry Hayes. What is this? "O caso Paula Ranier", por Henry Hayes. Nothing is ready. Henry was always in it. I didn't ask for it. Someone will have encouraged you. I'm not going to throw this in your face, okay? You know well that I will always support you. Go home and take a break until Wednesday. And don't worry about anything. I WISH YOU HAD A GOOD SHOW, DAD. Don took his time, but he made it. Look, honey, we have a visitor. - Hi, Henry. - Hi, Don. What a pleasant surprise! I was passing by and went in to order Louise a cup of coffee. Of course yes. I see you very little these days. I have a lot of work. In "The Crime of the Week"? Yes and no. Have you... examined my text? Yes of course. It is excellent. Practically perfect. You haven't made any changes? No, almost none. I suggested some ideas to Dave. By the way, I brought you a package that came to you at the studio. Don't you want anything else, Henry? No thanks, Louise. They should know that... Do you want eggs? No thank you. I'm done. Something interesting? All right, Henry. Come on. Are you leaving? Honey, you barely touched your breakfast! Henry wasn't finished either. Henry is satisfied. We're satisfied. Thanks, Louise. Sorry for the inconvenience. I'm going to see the show tonight. The more I work on it, I find it more mysterious. Don't you think, Don? See you later. What is it? Nothing, a joke. A gift from a fan! I'll be back late. Dave should let you have breakfast. Where did you get this from? I bought. The best investment of my entire life. Your face told me when you unwrapped it. I just bought the same size the police found it. You admitted the guilt reacting like that... Guilty! Guilty of what? I think the evidence speaks for itself. All right, Henry. Stop this conversation. What evidence? We should look at the police photos. Even being convinced to know everything about Paula. He was betrayed by his script. Your text confirms that you were a regular at your apartment. You described it by heart. I don't think you would notice it in the photos. But by placing the sofa near the window and the phone in the living room near the dressing table, It was something that intrigued me. Continue. So I spoke to Mrs. O'Halloran, the maid. Everything was correct, until the day of the murder. The day she moved the furniture. It doesn't mean anything. No... Not by itself. But it's enough to please someone with a critical mind. And the striped pajamas, did not come back from the laundry. up to two days after the murder. So, you had seen it before, put it on it. Hard to prove, Henry. You believe? You took the wrong path. No... I need time to hear you. If you had such a good relationship with Paula Ranier, definitely, it was for money. Not for love. Not even with you. There is also the coincidence of the Credit Union. What are you saying to me? I am a member of the committee, you already know. They informed me of their $2,500 withdrawal, exactly on the day of Paula Ranier's death! To vacations! What a stupid idea! Then the money was returned. That was pretty obvious. Why did you stop here? You want to put this behind my back. Let's talk about it now, the two of us alone. They've already arrested Abbott! Yes, but it has not been tried. If you can suspect that Paula Ranier was ruining you... and that, taken to the extreme, you killed her. You are crazy... Are we going to see the police? What do you want, Henry? May you see Dave before Team "Colonial". They will renew the contract after this script. Tell them you're going to New York. And you will take my place! Yes... There is such a possibility. Otherwise, Dave knows my work. You got everything you wanted. - I think so. - It's full of tricks, Henry. Unless I refuse and dump it in the sewer... everything I've worked for. New York's sewers are more attractive than prison... I think Louise will agree. The last few weeks have been very happy for you, Henry. Even more than he had imagined with his brilliant brain. You threw your spider's web around me! They will love phrases like that in New York. Don't even think about it, Don. It wouldn't do you any good. You're a nice guy, but you have a lot to learn. Louise? Come quickly to the studio. I have something urgent to tell you. Get ready, it's important. It's very important... When will you be here? Well, see you before the broadcast. So are they convinced they're going to win? I had to pay Abbott a few more bucks. Henry found one that looks like you. And I don't say he's guilty! But liven up the show. There's nothing wrong with that. The text impresses me. Hayes is a smart guy! And the screenwriter too. I would like know you. On the right time. Don, this is Lieutenant Stevens helping us. - Your text is very interesting. - Thanks. Did you like the rehearsal? I couldn't see it. Henry seems to have done it well by his hand. Well, let's go to the studio. On the table, in the right lamp. And all that? The panda in the armchair. Give me that. Oi, Henry! Finally it came. - Is everything okay? - Yea. See you later, Mike. You will be surprised, right? George, turn on the lights! - Very realistic! - Thanks. Don, nice ending to the series, right? Have you seen my wife? Your wife? Do not. Camera three, frame the image on the ground. Where is Sonia Here I am. Well, dear, a sound rehearsal. Chamber three, frame. OK, microphones are ready! Testing: Morning Star Members, they will always receive me with all their disposition. Okay... Clear the scenery! Go to the public booth. Ok, Henry. He will tell me what the ad looks like. Sensational. Looks fine to me. Ready in three minutes. Everything is ready? All set, instead... English translation. Yes. All ready. Sit down, Ted. Two minutes. Attention operator! Courage, friend. Here we go again. Attention, camera. Ten, nine eight. Run the movie. six, five, four, three, two, one... Action! We started with the location, ok? Please don't get up. What is so important? Tomorrow, "Colonial" must renew. Or not. Mrs. Newell, Lieutenant Stevens, - from the Los Angeles Police. - How are you doing? How are you? - My assistant. - How is it going? Attention #1, fading with the music. "Colonial" the sweetest cigarette... "Your" cigarette! Tonight, "The Crime of the Week" presents a true story, based on a real fact, a murder. Police files have not yet been closed. The end is not yet known. But the beginning is! at least, for the most part... "Colonial" invites you to judge... "O caso de Paula Ranier" Your turn, Sonia. This is Paula Ranier. Actress... from time to time. Model ... occasionally. A confident young woman that with her beauty she could achieve anything. Men always look at Paula two or three times. and for a time Paula Ranier did it with her looks. and got his way. Just being Paula Ranier would be enough. Jake, sync the music to the scene. But it's really enough, enough to die for. Just three weeks ago, the doorbell rang as he used to do often. And a man was at the door, as he used to be so often. His name is still unknown, but what he did carried her definitively to her death. You can't dump me like that. It's all over... Go away! Who are you waiting for tonight? Of course you already know where the alcohol is? I know where everything is here. And what is the use? That lighter... It's exactly the same! "We are realistic." You think you know all the answers. Without even knowing the questions. For example? For example Sam Martin's 25,000, Staley bribes. Details that may interest a lot of people. Paula, you won't say anything to anyone! So leave me alone. Paula, you don't know what you expose yourself to. You seem to know too much. I'm glad you see the difference. Unlike other people, but not for me. So, you will do what I tell you. You're going to drown, dear. I learned to swim, you know? Gave me an insurance policy. Get out of here, you fool. It's amazing that you're still alive. I know how to choose my partners. They are too shy to be violent. You're wrong this time, Paula. And that can get very violent. But come on man, I was just kidding. No, please, please, no. Thus, Paula Ranier. Born in Missouri 25 years ago, died... strangled. In a few minutes you will see some details. about the life of Paula Ranier. But first, a message from "Colonial". Who told you to play this song? Shut up please. - Who told you to play that song? - Henry, of course. If you don't smoke "Colonial", loses the pleasure of smoking. Buy "colonial" cigarettes, try "colonial" cigarettes, and will be a big fan of "Colonial". Nobody goes very far. What's happening? I have something to tell you now. I knew Paula Ranier, more than an actress. She never meant anything to me. I'm very sorry. - Did you kill her? - No. No, I didn't kill her. But Henry pretends to blame me. Please help me dear! Jake! Or what did Don want? Know why I used this disc. - You told him. - Yes why not? This continues. I have to find the script! "Por Henry Hayes" Whatever happens, nothing matters if you don't believe me. I try to understand. But why... Yes, I believe you. Because... I love you. - Have you seen Newell? - No, Mr. Hayes. Did not leave? No sir... The transmission has not ended... He's with "The Crime of the Week". Okay, don't let anyone out. "The door is never locked." He knew this because he had been there. "Get out of here" She starts to laugh. Unable to stand up. I heard her laugh before her death. And her killer too! If there is a disc title, it's proof. "He looks at the body. The disc is replaced. The melody of "Tentation" is heard, "the only sound in the room". Henry we Paula! He put down even the smallest details! His obsession! What are you going to do? Call the police. Mike Stevens, he will understand right away. Hello, call me Lieutenant Mike Stevens. Lieutenant Stevens is in the studio cabin. He's gone. I'll meet you in the elevator. Weaver, is Lieutenant Stevens gone? When you see him, hold him in the elevator until I arrive. This is Don Newell. I have to talk to him. Come on. Good night. Second floor table, Weaver speaking. Sim, Sr. Markson. Mr Newell urgently wishes to see you. Okay, Mr. Markson, I'll tell you. Mr. Markson is waiting for you in study "B". He was wrong, must be the "D". I'll take a look. Drop it! I beat you again, Don. Come here! Henry... you! I called as if it were Weaver, for you to come to this soundproofed studio. I said come here! Ok, Henry. Henry... I beg you! You are nervous. Reflect a little. I've been thinking for a long time. That way you won't save yourself. Stop talking! Stay by her side. You thought you were too smart. Please, Henry! You did not listen to me. - You forced me into this. - What? Do you think I'll let you live? You've gone crazy, Henry. Reflect on what you are doing. You had your reasons for killing Paula. The jury will understand them. It won't go that far. Are these stupid Westerns the best we've got? - It's better than nothing. - You believe... I would like to speak to everyone right now. Well I'll call the boys. Everything went well? I couldn't do better, Dave. In study B... are they doing a rehearsal? Ligue o som do "B". The weapon will be in your hand. Who will believe it was a suicide? Henry, your big brain is getting stuck. I will say that Paula was blackmailing you. They will believe you killed her. Mike! - Who will suspect me? - Yea? Henry, how can you... To kill? Why not? Why not me? With that door closing in my nose. Insulted by that... little bitch. Yes, I killed her! - Where is it? - In study B, come on. Too late, she said... Goodbye, she said. So she kicked me out. I took a few steps. He knew how to proceed. I returned. The door was always open. Not Louise! Shoot, but don't touch Louise. Shut up! What are you waiting for? He is well? - Where's the phone? - In the cabin. I took care of all the details, almost all. It was perfect until... Here you have a great script. But... don't forget... the details. Come on, everybody out here, we have rehearsal! I have important things that... What is this, what happened here? Translation: Adil Qatine
