Veronica! Michelle? Yeah? Dinner's at six, okay? Okay. It's the voice of the Blue Jays' Buck Martinez. Nice to see you here in the studio. - Good morning, Jan. - Good to see you. - Nice to see you. - We are rooting for our Jays. And they haven't been in the playoffs for 20 years... So what's going on with our Jays? [speaking native language] - No. - Go sit down. - Dinner will be ready soon. It's a matter of now going out and proving that they're worthy of the close season. It's been a long time. Now, obviously, they got a lot of great players, Bautista, Encarnaci?n, Landon. It's just a matter of having the ability to score runs. That's been the biggest concern. This team has always been about pitching concerns. But right now, they're having trouble scoring runs. Ooh. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Would you like to say Grace? Sure. Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive. - Amen. - Amen. Michael, would you give me a hand with something after dinner? Yeah, Dad. Do you suffer from ED? If the answer is yes, you're not alone. Damn country radio! Roses love sunshine Violets love dew Angels in heaven Know I love you You know, in France, Michelle is a man's name. - Hey, Bruce. - How you doing, brother? Uh, sorry, 21 and up, big guy. I'm 27. - Like hell you are. - Come on. Sorry, ma'am. Without a single penny in your arms You were set to do some harm Like a leech on my neck Made my life into a wreck Should've seen through sins you did I'll be the one whose blood will spill Posing as someone you'll never be Oh, God, I hope you never breathe I was always in your chains Always being your little saint Time and time, you break me down... Here we go. - Nice girls, huh? - Yeah. I'm made of steel I will survive You were my brother in arms... My dad brought me to a place like this when I turned 18. I've never been. Well, here's to making up for lost time. Mmm. Cheap little liar Not so long time ago I would've ate a bullet for you... They've got a great buffet here, $9.99, all-you-can-eat at lunch. Sweet. That even ain't fuck you Just take a look around Hell hounds will tear you down You were my brother in arms... Be right back. Oh, no, hey Like a sister Screaming many times... - I'm sorry. - Oh, it's okay, hun. Up next, put your hands together for the gorgeous Georgia!

You got a ten, don't you, Bruce? - Oh, I'm all right. - No, thanks. Pardon? - I'm all right. - No, thanks. They say you're not supposed to touch anything, but if you're real discreet, it's okay. - Sorry, I'm... - Pardon? - I'm not interested. - Not interested? - Sorry, man. I didn't mean... - Sit down!
