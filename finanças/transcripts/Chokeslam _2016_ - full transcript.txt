Okay. I um... I just want to be clear about something... This is a deli, a delicatessen. You're robbing a deli, not like, a bank. You know it's like meat, cheeses, potato salad, macaroni salad... okay. Should I bag it? Yeah. Okay. Have a great day, rocket. What did you call me? Nothing. Nothing. Enjoy your money. No, no, no. What did you call me? Class 2006, "let's go lions, let's go!" You're Luke Cromwell. The rocket. First of all, it's pronounced crom-well. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Second, I have no idea who you're talking about. You dated Alice Evans through most of grade 12. I'm warning you, man. You also have the single season football rushing record and you Stop it! have your nickname tattooed on your knuckles. Shit. Who the hell are you? Oh. Yeah. I'm Corey. Corey? Swanson. Corey Swanson. No. No? Wow! Okay. No, no. Dita wait. Wait, wait, wait. Just wait. Call the cops. - This guy, he... - He... He chased the robber out there. And he got the money back for us, actually. You're sitting on the wrong guy. This guy is a hero. He is. Yeah, he's a hero. Oh. Yeah, when Dita retires she's going to sell to me. There's an old hardware store sitting empty next door, so... Expansion. Expansion. Yeah. Some big brain buddies you got there. You. You remembering all that stuff you said about me. You perform that mental trick tonight, you're going to be the hit of the party. I mean, you are going tonight, right? The reunion? Oh, is that... that's tonight? Yeah, man. It's ten years. Ten years, can you believe it? I won't be going now, I guess. How come? I just needed some extra cash to fix myself up a bit. The rocket can't just show up looking like some kind of a homeless loser. You were the most popular guy in high school. Sure. No, really. Look, when I was in grade 10 you were in grade 12, everybody looked up to you. You were a god. When I was a senior and you were still there you were.. Same deal. You know what? You and the rocket. Walker heights reunion. Oh, I... Come on man, get excited for once in your life, huh? No. I can't. There's too many bad memories. You know I read that... you know, what's her name is going to be there. Miss thing. Sheena... what's it... you know that wrestling girl? Sheena dewilde? Yeah, that's the one. Yeah, I want to get a good look at her. See if she's as bangable as she is on TV. I'm just going to stop you right there, because I wasn't dumped. It was kind of a mutual decision that I needed to take some time off and that's why I've been training and focusing on becoming a better wrestler. It wasn't like I was fired or anything like that. Everyone's careers go up and down and I've... Dude, seriously? Off. Oh my god. This is Zach. Hey. Really, really cool guy. Smile for the camera. Stop doing that. Dude, just... I have universal abundance within me. I am one with the world. Hi. You're not easy to find Dr. Hayden. - Corey. - Corey! - Yeah. - Corey. I was coming for some advice, but I think I can figure it out actually. No. Follow me. As you can see my therapy career is temporarily on hold. Economic downturn, what have you. Yeah, I know it's rough out there. Yeah. An opportunity has sort of presented itself suddenly and it's... if this is a bad time I can just take off ...? No, no, no. No, no. I've just got to do something quick. Okay, yeah. So look, it's sort of the big c-word. Closure. I should have just said that. Ah. Look, Sheena is Sheena's back. She's back in town. What does getting closure mean to you now? I don't know, I mean I just figured... Sorry, continue. I don't know. Really I got the chance now to like, see her. Look at her. Not when she's on TV, in person. I should go see her, right? Corey. The last time you two saw each other, as I recall, things did not go very well. Yes, yeah. No, I know. It went really bad. Yeah. It's been a long time, okay? Ten years. Then I would proceed, with caution. I will. I'm going to go do it. I'm going to go see her. I'm going to go see her. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, mom? Hey, I'm going to the reunion tonight. I'll probably be home by like, 11. Not that I have to tell you any of that because I'm a 28 year old fully grown man and I don't have to tell you anything about my life. Hey. Oh, you scared me. I figured I'd take you up on your offer. Corey Swanson? You tried to rob me earlier? Oh. Yeah, you. - Yeah. - Yeah, Carey. - So what do you want? - To go to the reunion. You said you didn't have anything to wear... So this is my dad's. Boom. Hey, man. All right. Let's do this. Oh, is that Alice Evans? That's Alice Evans. - Right there. - Yeah it is. How do I look? Awesome. Hey babe, the rockets landed. Don't touch me. - Why? - Oh, Luke! Yeah, what's new? I'm born again. You're... okay. Christian. Fucking a. She still wants me man. Let's get a beer. We're sticking around. Yeah. 9 o'clock, check it out. Yep, I'd still do that. You know back in the day she used to hit on me all the time. Yo Carey, where you going? Your plane is going to crash and then you're going to have to eat other passengers so you can survive. You're going to die a friendless virgin who's had no sexual interactions so the blue balls kill you. You wrestling contract is fake and you actually signed up to be a lifetime spokesman for north Korea. You're going to live with your mom forever in her basement, and sleep in the same bed for the rest of your life. Oh I hope not. You still nervous? Yeah. What if this is a big mistake? What if in 15 years I'm nothing? - That's not possible. - Why? Because you're Sheena, and you're really talented and super smart and awesome and... come on. You're awesome, you know? You'll always have me. I don't know what I'd ever do without you. I've been blabbering on for long enough. What do you say we bring her on out here and give her a proper send off? You look great and you look like you're in super shape I found this online! - No, stop screwing around! - I hate your coffee! Sounds like you're stalking me. No. Dude, dude. Where the is my money, where the is it? I don't have it! Would have been nice if someone told me this was happening. I didn't do anything. No I'm not a drug addict, get out. Idiot! What do you have to say for yourself Sheena? Get that out of my face. Love you Sheena! You. Walker heights' biggest export, Sheena dewilde. Thank you, ten years. Yeah, it's been a long time. That sleazy reality show that you were on, you gonna do another season? Yeah, good luck. Broke her producer's windpipe. Wait that's not at all what happened, okay what happened- Why did you really quit the bwl after the rocky mountains smash thirteen. She never quit, she was fired for attacking some guy in a golf cart. Sheena? Okay, yeah it's no secret, I've made some mistakes, okay? But the bwl, they banned me for a year, but that year is almost over. Ask her a question. See if she's a born again. Let's put on the proper video. Smasheena's new career, "Do you want fries with that?" Aaagh! Whoa! Get in there. Cop a feel, grab her underwear. Sheena! Sheena! Sheena, come on let's get out of here. Come on, Sheena. Careful. You don't want to set him off again. Hey isn't that that guy? That's the guy that jumped isn't it? Alright he's very fragile, let's give him some space. Thank you for this really nice, yet incredibly awkward send off. To a special someone you make every day worth it, you know who you are. What else? Definitely not going to miss physics, or home ec, or the questionable beef dip in the cafeteria which I have no idea why it's... Sorry, sorry, I'm so sorry. I don't want to interrupt but I do, I just want to say something really fast. I'm sorry. Okay, all right. Sheena, you look beautiful. I know everybody here is going to miss you, obviously, but I think I can say that I'm going to miss you the most. I was thinking, I wouldn't miss you if... Sheena dewilde, will you marry me? Say yes! Come on, say yes! Do it! I just don't know how this could have happened. Mom, shh. He never gets hurt, he never does anything. I do stuff. Corey. Any medical problems that you're aware of? Of course not, he never gets sick. I give him vitamins every morning. He doesn't know. I know. Write down that he is perfectly normal. We may need to run more tests. Corey you stay there and don't move. - Hi. - Hey. So you're him? Huh? I realised it when smasheena was caving in your face that you were... you. Yep. Yeah, that's me. Look man I get it if it's a little weird to hangout with me now. I understand. No. No, no, no. I just wanted to say to you that I just wanted to see, I meant see if you were okay. Actually sounds crazy, but last night was awesome. That's good, so... you know, hang loose man. Hang loose. Yeah. Flowers, those are for you. There were chocolates but I ate them. Ow. Hm. Mom, what are you doing? What, what-those are my flowers, mom. Not anymore. You always thought that you could hide things from me? What? What things? Bad report cards, broken toys, lingerie catalogues. I've explained this, like, a million times, all right? Those, they came with the mattress. They weren't mine. Ow. Are you okay? Inside? You remember what Dr. Hayden told you? Inside, I'm fine, okay? Outside, you're hurting my neck. I'm just so angry. That angry libesian cow coming back to hurt you again. What? What are you talking about? What is a libesian? If you don't know, I'm not telling you. Oh, mom. This was an accident, okay? And I put myself in the middle of a big fight, so. It's always an accident when someone breaks your heart. Oh my god. Mom, we barely even talked, okay? There was no heartbreaking. Well, you just make sure that you don't give her another chance. Promise me? Yeah, mom. - Ow. - I have to go now. - Okay. - I have chores to do. See you later. Good day, mom. You too, honey. Is this gonna be, like, a tradition for you? Every 10 years, you gotta hurt the little perv? What did he do, grab your ass? No, and I didn't mean to... And hey, no big deal, I just planned this whole charity meet and greet for my famous pro wrestler sister. The least you could do is, I don't know, support me. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgive you. Okay, follow me. Do you see that man right there? Yeah. Okay. So that's the president of my board. He's basically my boss, and he's a huge fan of yours. So you want me to... Go over there. Chat him up. Casually bring up the need for funding for this shit hole, and you know, like, show some cleave. Like, stroke his... Evelyn! Ego. His ego, his ego, Sheena. Just go over there and be nice. Please? Open your mind to this kind of work. Please, please, please? - Fine. - Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Cheers. Would you like something to drink? My grandfather would take me to the legion hall on Friday nights when the legends would come through the territory. Course, then it was all territories, not like now. No. No, no, no. So Evelyn, she's very... Frank gotch. - Frank, yeah. - Lou tees. Mm-hmm. And my all-time favourite, killer Kowalski. Yeah. He, he, he was, he was good... - For my money - mm-hmm? - And repeat this to no one. - No, I, I won't tell anyone. - Gorgeous George. - Mm-hmm? Was really quite stunning. Miss dewilde? There is an urgent phone call for you. Oh, I, I hope everything's okay. Excuse me, Mr. cross. Bruno summerkino. He, he was, he was good. Join me this way virgins. You know, I'm not actually a caterer. You know, I mean, I do work with food, oddly enough, but, see, they wouldn't let... they wouldn't let me in, and so I sorta... and you looked really uncomfortable back there, Yeah, I, I should actually get back to my sister. Woah, woah, woah. I mean, we really didn't get to talk yesterday, and... Actually, can I show you something? It'll take, like, five minutes. Is that cool? Yeah. Yeah. We'll be right back. Five minutes, okay? Patrick's still booking matches? That's crazy. He gave me my first break here. Look, I'm, I'm sorry. I embarrassed you, and I embarrassed myself. Yeah, I definitely could've handled things better. I really wish that I'd stayed in touch with you. I just miss this place. This room, the sounds, the smells. I thought your dream was being in the bwl. Yeah, it was. It was awesome for a while. You know, I got to travel around the world and get a little famous. Oh! Horatio, you smell terrible. Just years of 300-plus days on the road, no real friends, working my tail off while I have another hand in my pockets. It just wasn't what I thought it would be. They're bringing me back, bwl, after my suspension. That's great. Isn't, isn't that great? Yeah, no. My manager worked really hard behind the scenes to get me in their good graces, so. If you're not happy, you know, you should quit. Technically, yeah, I haven't re-signed my contract, but I, you know, I couldn't just... It's your life, right? You just... Let's get out of here. Yay, you found me. Yeah, I texted your treasure. Not working? Missed you. Oh, hey, brother. Hey. - I'm tab. - Oh, a tad what? - No, tab, with a b. - Oh, yeah, it's tab with a b. - Yes. You okay? - Yeah, yeah, totally. What took you so long? It was this whole deal, and now I need multiple cocktails. Sheena; Yeah, sounds good. Just give me a sec. Oh, sure, yeah. Hey. That's your boyfriend. - Manager, but boyfriend, yeah. - Okay. Hey, maybe keep that under your hat, what I said. - Yeah, totally. - Okay, cool. I'm, I'm so glad that we did this. - Yeah, me too. - All right, well, I'll see you. Yeah. See you. - Hey. - Hey. You okay? Yeah. No, I... look, I, I just, I've been thinking a lot lately, and I, I know this is gonna sound like it's coming out of nowhere. But what if, like, instead of going back to the bwl, slamtasia, the deal that you've been working on nonstop for me for 10 months, what if instead I just kinda gave it up and sort of retire from pro wrestling as an alternate plan? Look, it's, it's what I want. I'm sorry. You're not mad? No, this is what you want. I'll support you. But we should just have a big old retirement match. I can call Mitch in Fresno or bj in Jersey. Or you could do it here. All right, easy, guys, let's just take it one step at a time. Yeah, we've gotta get going. It's really nice to meet you. - Yeah. - I'll see you, Corey. - Yep. - Good night. Take care, bud. Hi, may I help you? Let's go sit over here. Yeah. Okay, so, you saw her? Mm-hmm. - Closure? - Yeah. - Good, good. - Did it real casual. I was like, "hey, let's get out of here" because she was gonna fight again, and she punched me in the face, and it's totally fine. We talked later, cleared the air, and we really but she is awesome. She looks awesome. She sounds awesome. She smells awesome. You're still in love with her, aren't you? - Oh, Corey! - Mmm okay. I know, yeah, I look, you saw her. - Yeah. - You survived. - Yeah. - Turn the page. The last thing you need is to damage all the positive strides that you've made. Hey, Julius, call for you on line 2. Do you hear me? Hm? Loud and clear, Dr. Hayden. Loud and clear. I get that I'm getting a little ahead of myself with the mock ups. I do, you know. But I got two days, really, you know. Because after this machina day ceremony, she's gone, you know, and I-so I gotta get it together quick, and it's gotta be big. And I can't do that alone. You know, and I figured you know wrestling, right, and everybody knows you and so could, could you help? She could have her retirement match anywhere in the world, right? Yeah. Why the hell would she wanna do it here? Well, I... look, I get it, but it... we talked last night, and, you know, she got, like, really sentimental about her career, and she got, like... Wait a minute. Sad, actually. You were actually talking to her? Actually, we hung out at the pavilion. It was cool. Smooth, buds. You're smooth. So did you climb her beanstalk? Climb the old-oh, no, whoa. No, no, no. No, nothing like that, no. We just, we just talked. Look, I, I just know that she really needs this, Sounds like what she really needs is a good old foggy slam, if you know what I mean. Yeah, know what you mean. I get it. Go for a figure-four leg lock. Make her tap out. Make her show you her Boston crab. Okay, that's really funny. Deliver her a vietnamese Jewel press. You wanna stop now? Wait. Pile drive her. I'm just, I'm trying to reconnect with her man, And I don't know where this opportunity's gonna go exactly. I just, I don't want it to blow by me. And the longer you keep her in town, And then her love for the downward tingles touches your penis, and she stays forever. Something like that. Never gonna work. Never. I mean, we're talking about Sheena de wilde. You are, like, you know, buds. The odds are... I am aware of the odds, yeah. Hold up. I'll get to work on some ideas right now. Really? Yeah, for 165 bucks. 165 bucks? Rent's a little steep, you know, and you're the one who came to me. Well, yeah, I know I came to you, but I work in a deli. Yeah, I want it in cash. Now. I was just wondering if oh, my. What are you.. Ow. What-okay, ow, wait, okay. I just have a quick question. Sorry. Thought you were going for my tips. I'm sorry to interrupt... Excuse me miss, I-I, I'm sorry Hey, no cutting! Yeah, I won't. I'll go to the back. Reverse it like... Like that kind of thing. Anything you can think of, throw it all in one pile. I like where you're goin' with that. They're the only things I have planned. Wa, whoa-what are you doing? You scared the crap outta me! I've been hearing things. What... what, what things? Like you. Renting out the pavilion. What's next? Ask her out? Date her? Marry her forever? How do you know everything? Ah shit! It's just Malcolm, all right? He's helping me with hedges. Just uh, helping with the hedges. That's cool, Malcolm. Okay... Mom; We are not going through this again. Yeah, I know. Goodnight, Malcolm. Night, Corey. Partners in business, life true. When I saw her perform, well she just takes your breath away, doesn't she? These hundreds of fans who came out here today, they feel the same way that I do. Her story's yet to be told. - Hey. - You made it. Yeah, I did, yeah. Uh, thank you for the invite. The whole town was invited... but you too. Yeah... I'm sure you're busy... Hey, uh, actually I was wondering have you put more thought into doing the retirement match here? Cuz', if you did, I'm sure we can get the pavilion... Which would be... we'd redo the whole thing. We're actually looking into some bigger opportunities down south, Corey. Chicago. Maybe even Florida. Yeah, but it'd be great, you know, I mean this whole town would come. Guarantee it, like everybody you've ever met would pack that house. Oh, that's our cue. Oh, okay, um, talk after? - Yeah yeah. - Okay. Cool. Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a big hometown welcome Sheena de wilde! Thank you. Fraud... Fraudulent robot. Reality check! Who here thinks that living the Los Angeles dream has made her soft? Ohhh! Is this part of the deal? You don't see me flying around the world... Getting my feet massaged... Drinking cucumber smoothies. You sure as hell don't see me getting my opponents hand-picked. Just... just roll with it, there might be a good spin. Calling me out? Easy payday. Oh yeah? Easier than your webcam gig? Ohhh! I saw that. It's really nice stuff. Let's dance bean pole.. Luke, I don't know what the hell happened, man, big problem. Big problem! Luke, I called you like three hours ago man. Easy, broseph, all right? It's all done. What do you mean, what's done? The posters, duh. You put up the posters? That is what you do with posters. Beer? The posters I gave you were, were... were a mock up. A mock up. I just wanted your help to design it... It wasn't finished, I didn't want you to put them up yet. I was gonna tell Sheena about my idea after this ceremony, okay? Do you know... she hasn't agreed to do a retirement match here, sh-she hasn't given us permission to put her face u, u- u, up... literally everywhere! So I messed up. Yes, you royally frickin' screwed me, is what you did. She likes to do things her way. You know that. She likes to do things on her terms, and and, and this is not, uh... this is not... on her terms. This is not good. The posters are already up, so stop being so scared of her. I would say you're acting like you're scared of her. Oh yeah, I'm only going to say this once and that's it. I am not scared of Sheena de wilde - oh, shit. - Oh, shit. You trying to wreck my life, asshole? No, no. I can explain this. The whole bloody town is expecting me to wrestle Friday for my retirement match. What's wrong with that? I haven't announced my retirement yet. Besides that, though. Oh, a retirement match doesn't make sense here. It should be in a bigger market. Okay, hold on. I'm going to stop you right there, okay? Is that you or is that tab talking? Oh, back off! You back off. Did I just hurt you? I'm sorry. What I said to you was in confidence and then you went a broke my trust just like every shady wrestling promoter I've worked with for the past decade. Sheena, this is your thing, okay? You get to decide whatever. You can give the proceeds to charity. Sheena, this should be your thing and you should go out on your terms, right? Wouldn't that be cool? - No. - Okay. You leave me with no choice! Backyard, now. Okay, all right. It goes a little something like this. Smasheena, I pin you, okay? Then you do the match. Yeah? Oh, I see. You're afraid the match isn't choreographed? Yeah, I get it. You ready? Whoo! Okay, hold on. Wow, that was intense. That was awesome, yeah. For real. Ah! Aagh! Ooh! Okay. Whoa. Aaagh, oh. Oh! Shit, was that too far? Oh! Okay. I got you, one, two. Okay. I'm pinning you. I'm pinning you. Okay, okay. I'll do it, okay. Yeah oh. Why is having my retirement match here so goddamned important to you? Because it's important to you. Oh bullshit. You want something. What? You're just like everyone else. - Me? - Yeah. I'm sorry, when have you ever known me to try to take advantage of you? Yeah, even St. Corey Swanson is capable of hurting someone. Between the two of us, the only one I ever see getting hurt is me. Oh, oh. Low blow and not true. - Oh, so true. - Holy shit! - What? - Oh my god. What? There's wood in your ass! What? Did you-aaaagh! You take it out and then there's an artery and the blood will go everywhere and I'll die! Really? An ass artery? Yes, there's an ass artery, okay? There's such a thing as an ass artery. There's no such thing as an ass artery. Yes, and it's in the left butt cheek, okay? Oh, I can feel it now, now that I know it's there! What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Call the doctor! Did you even look at the picture? My first costume. Grade 11? Yep. God, I look like such a dork. So dorky. You helped design it. I helped with it. What? A scar. Be nice to hear what happened from you. There's a lot of stuff flying around over the years. Yeah. Only if you're comfortable with it. I'm sort of the farthest thing from comfortable at the moment, but yeah, okay. I was walking home. That was a few days after you left. I found myself in our old spot. There were these guys. I think they were just having fun, but one of the guys must have spotted me. Man, he started shouting like a maniac. What'd he say? Nothing. He didn't say anything. Cory, come on. What did he say? It wasn't crazy. Just this little voice he was doing was like... Hey, Sheena dewilde, will you marry me? Marry me, marry me, marry me. Ooh! I slipped and fell. This nice family found me. I guess the word spread that I had jumped. Anyway, after that, I became that guy. The guy that got so depressed that he botched a marriage proposal and then he decided to kill himself. So, I hurt you again without even being here. What? No, what are you talking? That's ridiculous. It's not on you. Okay, look, I know nobody in this entire frigging town believes me, not even my own mother believes, but I need you to just-oh, wow. I need you to listen to me for two seconds, okay? I'm dead serious when I say I did not try to kill myself, okay? Okay. Right, I've seen a lot of this. Sex toy mislaunched? God! You kids are sick. Okay, so all proceeds can go to my sister's art therapy charity. Let's do it. Come on, no. If you're going to do this whole thing out of pity then you shouldn't do it. I'm not doing it out of pity. I'm doing it because I want to. All right? Let's put on a good show. Deal? Yeah, deal. Cool. Good night. Night. What does your sister pull in? Sixty? Seventy a year? She could do better. So we're doing the retirement match here after all. I'm only going to say this once. We haven't even spoken to anybody about my mail-outs yet are you high again, Carl? It's Luke and yeah, I'm a little buzzed. Can always spot a weed man. I'm late, what's up? Nothing. I don't know. Yeah, did we want to discuss any business stuff. I could just jump into... We don't have to be formal or anything. If your wrestling people, puke or shit or urine anywhere that's not in toilet, you will pay to clean it up. No ifs or buts, none. Bruno raises a valid point. He's had a few tough nights janitorially speaking. So much urine. Maybe talk to the boys about their accuracy. Yeah, that's pretty disgusting. Cool, we can like monitor the bowel movements somehow. The audience is best we can. I'm not working with Horatio anymore. What? Yes, you are. Can I be serious for a minute? He's dead weight. Hey, I am not dead weight. Get the hell out of here. I'm tired of carrying you. You don't need to carry me. Get out of here. Get out of my way. Make me, huh? Boom. Gone. This bickering. '85, I'm in Mexico City, working with El chupacabra, place is sold out, 60,000 fans, I'm on top, working for the strap, puma comes out of the jungle, bites off a piece of my ear - there's that bad boy, I not only finish the match, I win it, keep the strap, and I get free Margarita mix for the rest of the night. Morning everyone. Corey, what's up? Great day, huh? Hi. Tab hennessy, pleasure. Tab hennessy hello. Wow. Wow. Boom. If it isn't baron Von brashton himself. Big fan, sir. That cage match in Pittsburgh in '95? Sold out? That was a heart-stopper. Guess who was working on top that night? - This guy. - This guy. Boom. That guy. Well hello, there, young lady. I'm tab. Tab hennessy, and I love your sweater. Those are mittens, tab. Sorry, I interrupted? Yes. We were just... I was just about to launch into a few things. So, I... my favourite seats, they're in row 6. But 6a through 6g, the whole row is a little wonky. Seats are fine the way they are. Yes. Yes, no, I love those seats, they're my favourite seats. And what about pyrotechnics? Is there any way-funny story. We had a fuel spill here, back in 2000, you put pyro, this whole place goes up. Boom like a box of kindling. Don't want to blow everybody up. Can I have a look? Mm-hmm. Hm. Wow. You put a lot of thought into this, but here's the problem, Corey. Can I call you Corey? I don't fault your passion, at all. But I did a quick tour here, earlier, and this pavilion is kind of, no offence intended it's a shit-hole. Hey, no shit. I don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I have a few alternative ideas, if anyone cares to hear them. Finally, and I promise we can move on after this last point, I check the breaker board, the light show Corey here's proposing, it'll blow the circuit. May even cause a fire. Could've killed us all. Could've. We'll need two 6,500-watt gas generators. One out front, and one out back. Tab should be in charge. Oh, guys, whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't organise. I can barely find my pants in the morning. You're in a really nice suit right now. Quiet, quiet. The tab is talking. Okay, where is your vip area? We don't have a vip area. This is athletic dancing at its finest. We need a vip area. That whole front row there, section that off, that's our vip area. Bruno, vip area. Very good. Vip. These electronics on this table, are these plugged into the intercom? I don't have a clue. Bruno? I'll make sure that they are. Now, where do your athletes enter around here? - The athletes, yes. - Down there. Down here? Okay. We need a red carpet. Sheena enters with a red carpet. Why the hell is there no red carpet down there? - What? - Okay. Okay. Who's the beast? - Oh, hey, that's... - Don't touch me. Okay. That's Renee partridge. Sure. He drives the giant hot dog truck down the street yeah. His handle is merciless mordecai. Hey, hey, that doesn't go there. Really going to let that pretty boy get in your way? That pretty boy just took over the entire thing. Back, there perfect. I mean, I had a solid plan. You know? Everybody's looking at me like I'm a mass murderer, it's crazy. Look at him, he's so manipulative. What is he doing right now? Tabloom hennessy the third. Man with amazing cheekbones and the most chiseled earlobes I've ever seen. You know, I had to fight the urge to kiss him on the mouth when he was talking earlier. You're cute too. I get it, I do. Okay? Figure something out. Nah, forget it. I'll make sure he's out of the picture. God, look at these girls. They need my help. What do you mean, out of the picture? I'm on it. That sounded weirdly threatening. Yo, Andrea. Luke, Luke, I can handle him. Luke. We need to talk. Luke, I can handle him, Luke. Like this. Oh. See that? I love this town. So pumped about the timing of this, Corey. Me being here for this, I can really put my thumbprint on it. Make it a night people remember for years. I'm going to transform this place. That's cool. That's sort of Sheena's thing, though, right? Who else should it be for? I don't know. Just sort of used the word "I" a lot just then. We're going to be like that, are we? Voices from ring: Good, Thursday. All right. Elbow. Okay? Like this. Right? Okay? Like this, right? You've got to get some speed. Yes, no, no, that's good. That's good. Yes, that was a very informative tutorial. Yes, I thought so. Hey, why are you doing this? I want to make your performance more believable. No, I mean, what's in it for you? What do you mean? You and Corey barely knew each other in high school. Mm-hmm. I just want you to know that if you put one toe out of line, I will break your limbs. And then bury you alive. You read me? Yes. Why don't you take a shot at me? What? Yes, yes. Get him the chair angel just help me warm up. You want me to hit you? Yes. It would really help me out. Oh, I don't know. With a chair? You know, I don't feel comfortable with that, you being a woman and me being a man. I'm fine with it. I think I should... chair shot. Oh. Ow. Nosebleed. Check that out. That's good. That's good. Where were you, bud? I had to run an errand. You okay? Yes. I got blasted in the face with a chair. I'm freaking awesome. Where are you going with those chairs. - Put them here. - No. Put them back here. Hold up, where are you going with her? Over there. - Is that where she goes? - Yes. Okay. Then get her over there. Hey, you all right, tab? Yes, I'm fine. Fine. Luke, hey. Hey, did you do something to tab? What did you... I told you I could handle him. What did you do? Oh, is he in the hospital? What? No. No, he's just... Has digestive issues, it looks like. - Nice. - What did you do? - Cut the brakes to his car. - What? Yes. He's sick too? Bonus. Beginning of the end for Horatio. Pile-driver. That should do it. One. Two. Three. Ring the bell. The winner. That is a scary individual, right there. You suck. You suck. You suck. You suck. You suck. Mordecai, you cannot work that stiff with an old man like Horatio. Hey, I hear your point and I don't disagree with you, but there's a time and a place. We have guys who can work that stiff. In my day, I liked it snug like that. Can you imagine me and you in my prime, would have taken every puma in Mexico City to town. Corey. Corey. What? I need you to do me a favour. What? Oh, yeah, anything. Come here. I need you to slap me in the face. What? I just, I need some adrenaline. What are you talk-no. What? No. Look, Corey, come on. I do it on the road all the time. Just hit me as hard as you can. No. Corey, I'm asking you to hit me. - What- - so hit me. I can't hit you. Are you kidding? I'm not gonna slap you. I can't hit you. You're a girl. I'm not gonna hit you. Grow a pair and hit me. Okay. All right. I'm gonna hit you. - Okay. - Okay. I can't do this! - Corey! - I can't- - Okay, okay, okay. - Okay, just do it. Ah! Ee! Ooh! Oh! Shit, sorry. It's reflex. It was reflex. Are you okay? Hm? Yeah. No, no. Is that what you said? I'm good. I'm good. I'm totally good. Totally good. Was that good enough for you? Yeah, actually. Best I ever had. Ladies and gentleman, allow me to introduce the three-time winner of the gold medal, the overseer of all that's good and true, get ready to witness your Saint, angel! Sheena destruction mode activate. Three, two, one. Smash! Smash!! Yeah! Come on. The sold out pavilion crowd on it's feet, smasheena can still whip up a crowd like nobody else. Angel's not wasting any time. She wants smasheena bad. Off those ropes, smasheena ducks under. Malfunction at the junction. Smasheena, smasheena, smasheena. Boo! Boo!!! One, two... Whoa. What an upset this would be folks. Lots of fond farewells to a legend. Smasheena, smasheena! These two warriors are leaving it all out there. Something's got to give. Come on! Angel going for her patent finish. Wait, quick reversal. Look out, Nelly! Smasheena, smasheena! Chokeslam, chokeslam. One, two, three! That's it. That is all. You could count to 50. Smasheena, smasheena! The winner of this match, smasheena! Smasheena! Smasheena! Smasheena! Woohoo! You folks want some more? I said, you folks want some more? Tomorrow night bring your ticket stubs back for 25% off. You ain't seen nothing yet. One more match, one more match, one more match. One more match! One more match! One more match! Sheena dewilde, allow me to introduce... This is Mr. suzuki. He represents- extreme Japan wrestling. Oh. You're welcome, babe. Hey, it's business pal. You understand. Yeah. Yeah. Read the important stuff! All right. It was a big success. The community raised almost $9,000. Malcolm! All right. A top scout from extreme Japan wrestling is interested in signing dewilde to a pro contract. Another impromptu event is to be held tomorrow night so the President of the company can see her in action. I thought you were going to relax? Mothers don't have that luxury. Oh, easy there, jumpy friend. You okay? Yeah, totally fine. You just scared me. Hey. Hey. Why you guys cabbing it? Somebody lock their keys in the car, or ...? It was the weirdest thing. Mechanic told me that someone cut my coolant line. It happens though, right. What are you doing out here? Oh, I don't know. Actually I was just riding and I guess I lost track of where I am. Tab's going to Cleveland today. - No way! - Mm-hmm. I've never been to Cleveland. That's cool. Why is he going? Some hot shot kid is killing out there so he wants to book him for my farewell match. - That'd be awesome. - Yeah. Oh, we should grab a drink then. Yeah, yeah. My sister's place actually is just- Sheena. Got to go. Next flight out. Oh, okay, well actually you can take the cab because Corey's going to walk me home. Yeah. A little celebratory drink. For Japan. Yeah, so I'll see you tomorrow. Travel safe. - Yeah. - Cool. Cleveland, that's awesome man. Konichiwa! Bye. Here you go. Wow, this is fancy. Yeah. Cheers. Yeah. Wow. That's bourbon, so you're supposed to sip it. Oh. Yes. That makes sense because that's really... intense. It's on fire right now. Oh, yeah. So if all goes well with the match tomorrow then you leave forever when, exactly? I have... I don't even know. I'm not there yet. God, Japan. It's weirdly perfect though, don't you- I mean, can't you see me there? Yeah, totally. It'd be weirdly perfect for you. See, you get me. This place is really ni... Oh, woah, ow! I did... I just stood up to fast. You're not riding your bike home. You can stay here. Well, laying down. You look really gross in this dim lighting. I hate being here with you, now, in this very moment. It's really awful. Right this second. It's terrible. Guys! - Oh! - Jesus! Evelyn, oh. Okay, yep. So I bumped into tab. I am so excited for you. You bumped into him where? Now I have a place to stay in Japan. Can you imagine? Yeah, I guess we'll see how it goes tomorrow. Sweet. Good talk. Okay. Bedtime. Okay, yep. Good night. Yeah, good night. It was fun. I had a good time. I'm sorry. Did I scare you? What? No. Yes, a little bit, actually, but it's okay. I was just making a sandwich, and I remembered how big of a loser you are. Oh. I even though about pouring burning hot bacon fat all over you while you were sleeping, how deformed your little face would be. I'm gonna go. So help me, if you even think about putting the moves on my sister again or proposing marriage or whatever you're gonna do. Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was for me? For you? That was embarrassing for you? Oh, wow, that's crazy, because, see, for me it wa- I am not interested. Got it, okay. Tell your sister I'll see her later. Sure a lot of anger in this house. Hey, I'm looking for the Russian bison. Are you from the beauty salon? Swanson. My apologies, just... no, you don't. I've got a groupon. You have a-oh, okay. Okay. Come on. Towel. Oh, yeah, thanks. Congratulations on Japan. Excited? Yeah, yeah. Must be hard going through life wrecking everything you touch. Mrs. Swanson. We're not going through this again. I don't know what you're... No, no. Okay, this is weird, so I'm gonna go. Do you know what his life has been like since you've been gone? Jesus. Yeah, people have moved on. Did he tell you about the billboard? Yeah. Some jackoff yelled at him. He was startled, and then he fell. What about the mental institution? Oh, wait. Excuse me. Look at this. Obviously you're getting pretty slack there in the kitchen there, Dennis. I mean, I'll still eat this, but I think you should give me a discount. No? I'm not gonna pay for this. Oh, hey. Andrea, I mean, sheen, sheen, Sheena. You Luke? Oh, what can I do for you? You're a really good friend to Corey, and I pegged you wrong. It's actually really comforting to know that he's got this support system here, especially if I go to Japan. Well, yeah, totally. I mean, we're buds, right? Me and Corey are buds. We're buds. I gotta ask you something. Mm-hmm? I'm just super confused because everyone is saying that he jumped off the billboard, but then Corey's telling me that there was these guys yelling stuff from their motorbikes. And, like, what, what happened? Do you know? It was a long time ago, you know, so, you know, I don't-I don't remember. Hey, can you pass the salt? You okay? Yeah, I'm frickin awesome. I gotta take a piss. Don't suppose you could put me into a figure-four leg lock. Not today. Oh, okay. Aaaahh! Ah! It was you that day, wasn't it? Ah! Tell me the truth! - Gah! - Tell me! God! Uh! Hey. Hey. Hi. What happened to you last night? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I should've said goodbye. I actually had this really weird nightmare, burning hot bacon fat all over my face. - What? - Got all deformed. Stupid. I had a good time last night. Have you seen Luke? I've been calling him, and we have stuff to do, and he's nowhere to be seen. Have you seen him? No. What? Nothing. Jesus. Did you get that from wrestling? No, I didn't. Why are you being weird? Then what is it from? He confessed, Corey. He's the one that shouted at you from the bikes. What? I'm sorry, did you... Did you beat it out of him or something? He's not your real friend, Corey. He's only helping you because he feels guilty. That sounds familiar. What-okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you mad at me? He's- who do you think are you are, coming back here and meddling in my life? He's my friend, okay? Look. I know about the psychiatric hospital, okay? What, did Evelyn tell you that? No, your mom. You went to my mother? She came to me, okay? She was worried about you. Oh, you're unbeliev- you're unreal! I didn't know, Corey. If I knew, I would've come back. I didn't need you to come back, okay? I don't need you to come save me, all right? It was a stress clinic, okay? And my mom checked me in there, and I stayed to appease her because she's crazy, and you know that, and I was there for a total of 48 friggin hours. Well, your 'friend' is the reason you fell. Why do you think I was up there to begin with, hm? You said in the hospital that it wasn't because of me. Yeah, look, I know what I said. Okay? I don't know if I was up there and I was going to jump. Except for some really dark shit because I was 18 years old and you broke my heart. Cool. Yeah, okay. Well, I have the biggest match of my life, so I don't know how I'm supposed to do that if- You were never worth killing myself over and you definitely weren't worth all of this. I'm done. I'm not thinking about her anymore. I'm not thinking or talking about her every again. Not one more moment after this moment right now where I'm talking and thinking about her. That's it. That's the last one. Hey. Hey. You've still got me and if you want to start seeing me regularly, again, we can arrange that. Okay, so, I explained everything. Are you sure you're okay here? Absolutely, yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah, so, you know, just don't unplug this cooler at all. Ever. Day and night leave it running and don't eat the jelly salt, that stuff is disgusting. If I put my hand right here. No! No! No! Don't! Don't! Don't! I'm just kidding. I'm kidding, Corey. Kidding. Kidding. Ha-ha-ha. That's the no-hands zone. Okay. All right. You be careful. She's a tricky devil, don't lose a limb. Good luck. Plan b, you're fighting Horatio. Okay, what about the guy in Cleveland. He made me shave his back. Never mind. Why are you so tense? Just, it looks like a sellout. Yeah, well, I had to show watanabee you're a global draw. Just do what you do best and we're set for life. Look, I know that Japan is important to you... This is everything you've ever wanted. I went out and I got it for you. Is this because of him? Because if it is, I don't know whether I should be angry or laugh. Yeah, wait, uh, yeah. Hey, jan? Is this the right baguette? Malcolm, now you know you can't come barging in here like this. I'm sorry. Thank you for bringing the groceries, like I asked, very nice of you. On your way now. Ah, well, you're welcome, Ms. Swanson. Mm-hmm. See you, Corey. See you. Bye-bye now. Bye. How about that? Just negotiated you a signing bonus. Right there. Two minutes. What do you think Swanson was up to in that time? Look, I appreciate all your help. I do, and I want this Japan deal also, but could you just like give me some space? Just have a lot on my mind. Well, excuse me for trying to better our lives. Let's just talk after the match, okay? Let's be clear, I got you this opportunity and I can take it away. Oh, really? What? You think I don't deserve my due, after all the shit I put up with handling you? Holding your hand in rehab. Getting you on a reality show. Building up your wrestling credentials only to have you start having feelings again for some pathetic little waste of skin. I appreciate all that you've done for my career. Thank you. Your career? Mm-hmm. What about us? It's like that is it? Fine. Hey. Hey. You know how I've been trying to... I feel like shit, man, and I just wanted you to win one. You know? Just once. You know, get the girl. I should've apologised for the billboard. Everything. I'm sorry, bud. Okay? Cool. So you're not going to the big match? I saw through the window you were eating. You know? What are you eating? Hot chocolate for my boys. All right. This is ridiculous, Janet. - Mr. Kirby, really, you can't- - no, no, Janet. Please. Enough. - Malcolm, this isn't- - now I know this isn't my place. I know you're not my wife. He's not my son. I'm just the friendly neighbour, right? Yeah, well, I'm the friendly neighbour who has been nailing your mother for the last 11 years. Classic. Hey, Malcolm. I knew that. You did? Why do you think I keep asking for earplugs for Christmas? Oh, my word. Okay, good. And her opponent from the netherworld, weighing 300 pounds, 'merciless' mordecai. You can't sit here eating cereal and expect to be with that girl. I don't expect to be with the girl. The girl is never going to be with me. Okay? I tried, so why bother anymore? Okay. Okay, let me get this straight, she's gone, forever, and you're back working at the deli- forever. Are you good with that? He's right. That creepy old man, who's nailing your mom, he's right. You're wrong. Yeah! Woo! Now's the time! Things going bad to worse for smasheena. Come on, guys. She's getting her ass kicked. Corey, you've got to do something. Mordecai living up to his name, showing smasheena no mercy. Locks in the "crab," this could be it. Oh. Oh, this smells like ass. Oh, this is disgusting. Oh. Hey, buddy. Playing a little bit of dress up? Oh, god. Oh, you're a bastard. You put mordecai in the ring with her, man. Don't think I don't know you're trying to screw Sheena over. What is wrong with you? Someone's got to feed the beast and she's made a poor, poor career decision. Yeah. No, totally. You know, but she's Sheena, right, and she's like really hard to deal with sometimes. I was really hoping things would get physical. Look like a fracas has broken out in the crowd. Smasheena has shown no offence tonight. Hey, that's the douchie guy from last night. What's he got against Horatio? I had to shave that guy's back, Corey. I shaved his back! Horatio! Horatio! Horatio! Here come the Horatio chants. Horatio! Horatio! Horatio! He's looking trim, by the way. Lost maybe 90 pounds since last night. Is that even possible? Mordecai's looking to finish smasheena off once and for all. Kick that guy's ass, Horatio! Douche drops an elbow. He's saying something to mordecai, I can't make it out. Rake of the eyes! Smasheena has the chair, cracks mordecai with it. Finally, smasheena showing some life. Woo! Yes! And so is skinny Horatio. Douche into the turnbuckle. It's chaos in there. The ref doesn't know what to do. Mordecai down, so is the douche. Skinny guy of his own count. Have you ever seen anything like this, folks? Who even won the match? Who cares at this point? Oh, shit. Sheena, i... Ever since you got back into town I've been trying to... Muster the courage to tell you that... That I love you. No! Do what you got to do, boy. If you leave, I want you to know that I'll be fine. You know? I will... I will pick myself up and I'll be okay. Oh, wow. Smasheena! Smasheena! Smasheena! I think I have a concussion. Eh, you get used to it. Good height on that chokeslam though. See the leg-whip kick and you look like a champion out there. Come on. Yeah. Smasheena! Smasheena! Smasheena! I sometimes get mixed up in the ring with my clients. It's this whole heel/manager character that I've been working on. Can I still come to Japan? Please? No. Aaahhh!!! Okay, fine. That was fairly romantic. I guess you're not a humongous loser. Corey- oh, yeah. Piledriver. Yeah. High-five. Yeah. Corey, there may have been a small fire at the deli last night. I'm not sure. I ran out. Dr. Hayden, thank you for your help. I appreciate it. Great job out there, Corey. Hey, why don't we all go and share a nice banana split? How about you guys do that and then I'll hangout another time? Cool? Mom, I'm okay. All right? I kicked that dude's ass and it was really awesome. Yes, it was. Yes, it was. It very much was. Oh, hey. Yeah, sure. You get the girl and I get a hotdog, even though it's a pretty boss hotdog. What happens to me now, huh? Where will my life lead? You want a job? You mean like one of those working jobs? Yeah. Like for money? Yeah. Yeah? Sure, boom. Cool. Yo, buds, where do you work again? Hi. Where'd you get that hotdog? You want my hotdog? So, well... I just... Wait. Stop, wait. Woah. Okay, hold on. Wow, that's... No, okay, look, I think you just like- no, no. Hold on, this is going to make things a lot harder. You understand? Because you go and now I have this moment to think about for god knows how long. I go? But you're coming with me, you idiot. What? What are you talking about? They said that they talked to you about your crazy character and that you're super excited to come with me. Wait, what? What are you do-... what? Talked to who? Talked to where? Go where? To Japan with me. Don't worry, you're not going to be like my sidekick or anything. Oh. Oh, wait the people... I do. The people I just met. We like high-fived. Oh, no way! They want... Are you kidding they want... Yeah. I will totally be your sidekick. - Great. - 100%, I will. - Absolutely. - Okay, awesome.
