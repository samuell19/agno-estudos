Not much. Hey. Hey, very good. Hey Jack, anything I can help you with? No, not really Steve. I appreciate the help last week on that project. It's nice to know I have that one friend who will always be there no matter what. People around here are so fucking flaky. Hey man, just trying to help. See, some of these people come here. They come in and they leave. They only out for themselves, and they don't care about anything but themselves. I know they don't give a shit, man. I hate people. You know, some of these folks have two lives. I see some guys come in with rings on their fingers and get all touchy with the women. That's fucked up. Yes it is, man. It's like they have a face they put on for the public, and then they have a face, a wife and kids at home. And then it's like they're living two lives. Dark side, and the other side. Hey, Jack? Do you have a dark side? You don't know the power of the dark side. (LAUGHS) Right on, Vader. Can always use a Steve wisdom, though. See you around, bud. Have a good one. TED: Jack. How the hell are ya on this fine morning? Could not be better my friend. How are you? Doing good. What's on the Jack Allen priorities for today? Just uh, a girl's head on a stick. A what? JACK: I said one of these ideas need to stick. Oh yeah. The new forms, the ones they're sending out. I mean, the old slogan sucks ass man. JACK: I could agree on that. Hey! Did you hear about the clown on the loose? Maybe it has something to do with the disappearances of the city. Shit, who knows. Yeah, I don't know. I heard a little about it. I mean, if it's true, he's probably getting rid of some of these lower class assholes. I mean, the city is too big. Someone's gotta do it, am I right? (LAUGHS) JACK: That's true, that's true. I can agree on that, Ted. TED: Look. A fucking clown outfit? Right? TED: I mean, that shit is dumb. JACK: I couldn't agree more. I know you gotta put something on if you're a bitch and can't show them your face. (LAUGHS) He is a bitch. (LAUGHS) TED: You always got that fucked up laugh, Jack. And you always had that fucked up smile, Ted. Hey man, duty calls. I'll see you at lunch, brother. - See you, Ted. - Yep. Hey, it's Ted. Yeah, yeah, I told you. I'll be there in ten. Did you not hear me? I said I'll be there in 10 minutes, all right? Okay. Get the fuck out of here, you piece of shit motherfucker. (HEAVY BREATHING) I'm the one who laughs! (HEAD SLAMMING THE GLASS) Fuck you Ted! Piece of shit! (TRACKS SQUEALING) (TRAIN PASSING) Robert, you're here. You let that asshole go last night? Look, you had me with Kyle, and I mean, he does what he does best. He gives teens shit for no reason, especially those in the Maul Creek area. CHIEF: Well? Well, we were patrolling the same area you always have us patrol. And the shit for brains sees some teenagers about 17 or 18, and starts flashing his lights at them. CHIEF: And? And what do you think happened? He pulls them out and makes them blow each other. One kids starts taking off running and he tells me to go chase the poor bastard. I'm not chasing a kid doing nothing. Well fuck me. Yeah, I wish somebody would. Listen. I'll talk to Kyle personally. All right. Hey. One more thing. Look, I know you got an opinion on everything. Yeah. What's your opinion on this guy running around in a mask, acting like a clown, killing everybody? Well, I think the killings for him are personal. Anyway, I don't know. I kind of got an idea of when and where he's gonna strike next. All right, slow down cowboy. Just stay in your lane. You know? - Just get back to work. - All right. (CARS PASSING) Okay, either we figure something out or we're gonna lose money and we're gonna lose our jobs. We don't need be biting at each other's throats. We got bigger problems than this. And what's that, man? Well we need to cut out the personal crap, you know? Yeah, just focus on what's in the business at hand here. Your personal business is your personal business. Your personal business is your personal business. We don't need to be knowing anything about it, unless it affects the company itself. Jack, what do you got? JACK: How do you expect our employees to work so well with somebody who's a manager, who's a complete fucking hypocrite? Well I don't know Danny, Danny... JACK: Get a life! I saw the job you offered at work today. Oh well, okay one, that wasn't my wife or ex-wife. That was an Uber, thank you very much. Yes, she was sexy as fuck, too. JACK: Fuck, I'm gonna need some fresh air. Okay. Jack, we're in a... I'll see you guys. Kid going through his daycare. You kidding me, right now? (DOOR CLOSES) He left in the middle of the meeting. Why's he so upset about your personal business? I mean, is there more going on than we know? I mean, you know. Yes, this is really not going to help. Is anybody going after him? I'll go. Or should we just let him cool down now? Chase him away. Oh no, I'll go chase his stupid ass down. (ENGINE REVVING) (TIRES SCREECH) (DOOR OPENS) Hey. Hey. Long day? You've been gone since 5 a.m. Yeah, something like that. Uh, how's work? It's fine, you know. The usual. I think I might be getting a raise soon, so that's good. You know, it's finally so great to be recognized for the job that I do. You know, I just work so hard every single day. (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) I've been working so much. I get so stressed. You know how much stress that I've been under? I deserve this, you know? (RINGING DROWNS OUT JEAN'S VOICE) (MULTIPLE VOICES CHATTERING) (JACK LAUGHS) JEAN: So that's funny? What? No, I'm sorry babe. It's just been a really long day. My mind's fuzzy. I was just saying, everyone at work has been talking about this clown and all the missing people in the city. Mmm. JEAN: It's really scary. Yeah it is. JEAN: I can't even feel safe going out into public anymore. I just hope someone finds him and turns him in, you know? Yeah, I hope so too. A clown, that's something else. Anyway, um, there's leftovers in the fridge if you get hungry. Thanks babe. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PINBALL MACHINE RINGS) Heading to bed. All right, we'll see you. JEAN: You coming? (PINBALL MACHINE RINGS) Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. - All right. - All right. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (JACK SIGHS) RADIO VOICE: 2-13 80, we have a follow-up on the missing persons case from last Tuesday. They were last seen at Myer's Park in the back section. Over. I'm in that area. I'll go check it out, over and out. (ENGINE STARTS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Jesus, fuck! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WATER RUSHING) (CARS PASSING) Look, at the crime scene, I found a red nose and clown paint. That proves it! But no prints. No, I guess he was wearing gloves or something. Thought I told you to stay in your own lane. Look all I did was... I don't want to be involved. Look, I responded to a call, that's it. Stay in your lane. (CAR HORNS HONKING) TV VOICE: Local officials have indicated that the suspect linked to the Myers Park killings, looks like the following sketch. It is believed that the suspect is working within the metro area. Officials request that any tips be submitted to our hotline. (JACK LAUGHS) In other news... Jack, you okay? Look fellas, I gotta Usain Bolt. I gotta get some more. (DOOR CLOSES) What the hell just happened? Wow! You don't think it was him, was it? On the TV? No, I don't think Jack's capable of something like that. (CAR HORN HONKS) Seriously? What do you think? Was it him? It can't be him. Hope not. Never know what a man might do. Or is capable of doing. He's got his issues, but you know. I don't think Jack's capable of doing something like that, or even that he'd want to. I mean you know. That can't be him that was on TV. That can't be him. I thought it was you. Why the hell would it be me? It just seems more likely. Was I a dick to you last night? Pretty much. Okay. You think (MUMBLES) Hey, you know I think we're making more out of it. Hope so. I mean Jack? Seriously? I don't know, man. You should talk to him. He still hates my guts, still. You probably should talk to him. You guys need to patch things up. Can you see if he's willing to talk to you about it? Get things settled? Yes. (JACK STOMPS DOWNSTAIRS) Fucking kill you, Ted. (JACK BANGS ON FENCE) (HEAVY BREATHING) (JACK CACKLES) Did you have a good day today? Yes. Are you ready for Christmas break? It's coming up soon. Yes. Is this the same parking garage? I think. I can't remember. It doesn't say which garage it is. Nah, not over here. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey mom, can I get a picture with the clown? I don't think that's a good idea. Let's go. (TRAFFIC NOISE) (JACK STABS MOM) (JACK LAUGHS) (UNICYCLE THUMPS JACK) You bitch! You you fucking bitch! (JACK SCREAMS AND LAUGHS) Fucking daughter! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KNIFE STABBING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ENGINE REVVING) (TAPPING ON GLASS) JACK: Hey! Seriously? JACK: What? I've let it go the last few nights, but I'm sick of this shit. Babe, what the hell are you talking about? Oh, I don't know. You're hours late home every single night from your shift. Last night, I didn't even hear from you. You were gone all night. Look, what do you want me to... I know when you're lying, Jack. Sweetie, it's just... (KNIFE HITTING FLOOR) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) No, don't leave! (JACK CRYING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (JACK YELLING) (DOOR CLOSES) (LEAVES RUSTLING) (SCRAPING METAL) (JACK GRUNTING) Fuck Fuck! (JACK SCREAMS) Fuck! Goddamit! (JACK SCREAMS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (JACK LAUGHING) (JACK SCREAMS) (CRYING AND LAUGHING) (JACK SCREAMS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WATER FLOWING) I'm telling you all this, so you know before the media freaks out. We think we got the serial killer, and a little bit more information on him. We know he worked across the street. Now the press knows a little bit more. But they don't know his name. His name is Jack Allen. How do I know this? That's a great question. His girlfriend reported him last night. She told us everything. Without going into detail, keeping this brief, it all adds up. She brought in the knife used in the killing in the garage. And the blood and prints match. And the other disappearances line up with the times he was not home. If this doesn't make sense, I got it all right here. Courtesy to the fellas and ladies back at the office. Some of you need to focus on this, some of you keep your eyes peeled. Oh, and he stole a Volkswagen, stolen right around the corner, at the time of the disappearance. It was right across the street as well. That's everything. Good to go. Check. You run the DMV on the Volkswagen. I'll track this other information down. I'll give you a call in a little bit. Sounds good. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Oh Ted, what's up? Come on in brother. Hey man, doing good, how you doing? Pretty good, pretty good. Good seeing you. Good seeing you too. How long's it been, a couple years? Yeah, it's been two years. Probably two years and three days. Yeah, it's been a while. You can go ahead and take a seat over there. All right, man! How's work? How's that been? Work's going all right. I thought I was gonna get laid last night, but it didn't happen. But other than that, work's going okay. Wanna drink? Yeah yeah, yeah. Whatever you want. Look man, I have to talk to you about this Jack Allen character. Can't say much, cause I'm on the force. Just personally I'm trying to piece some shit together, man. What can you tell me about him? Well everyone at the office is paranoid, since the news named someone in the building as the killer. Since they got all of that evidence given up by his girlfriend. You sure it's not Jack? Personally, between us bros, I can't tell you too much, but he's a person of interest. So is there anything you can give me about acting weird around work? TED: Okay, I got you. But look, he hasn't been at work in the last few days. He's been acting odd from the last few weeks. Yeah. I always joke with him, but it seems he can't take a joke. He has a strange view of this world. Yeah, you know, I'm getting, in his position, that are higher up, they do have some separate lives. Not naming him the main suspect, but... Hey man, duty calls! All right, brother. Hey, thanks for the drinks. Thanks for everything. It's good catching up on old times. Yes it was, yeah! Keep in touch. I sure will. Thanks for the information, brother. Mmm-hmm. Hello? Who's this? Are you gonna fucking say anything? TED: Where are you going? I'm getting some air. Okay. TED: We got less than a month to decide about this company. Okay, we'll make the meeting at noon. I don't have to worry about your bullshit. Okay, we'll meet at noon tomorrow. Right here, all right? And I promise you guys, I will straighten up. Oh my God, I just hope it's not Jack. I just hope it's not Jack. I just hope it's not Jack. (CROWBAR HITS TED) Ungh! (BODY FALLS TO FLOOR) Fuck, Jack is that? (HEAD HITTING WALL) (HEAVY BREATHING) (BODY DRAGGING ON FLOOR) JACK: You motherfucker! (HORNS HONKING) Yeah right? Jack? (ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE) (JACK WHISTLES) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come in! (DOOR CLOSES) Hi! Nice to meet you, I'm Robert. I'm Jean. So I can't give you too much information about the case, and what we're doing. You saw the weapon fall out of his pocket. JEAN: Mmm-hm. And you found letters. JEAN: Yes. Pictures. And so you kinda pieced everything together. Yes, um, yes. That's exactly what... As soon as I saw the knife fall out of his jacket, everything started to make sense, and he's been gone almost every single night, and when I pieced everything together, everything lined up with the killings. It all made sense. Could you give me a brief history of y'all's relationship? Oh Gosh, um, like from the beginning? Yes, from the beginning until up to now. Well, we met in college. We've been together for five years. When we first met, I was smitten. We were very close in the beginning of our relationship. I guess everything was perfectly fine for a couple of years. And then everything just recently, in the past couple of years, has been going so far downhill, he's pulled himself completely away from me. He doesn't talk to me. He's spacing out almost all of the time. He's gone almost every single night. I have no idea where he is. I just, he doesn't talk to me. He doesn't do anything, so I just don't understand. It's just changed a lot. So, when you found the letters that he had written, to the police officers, and the drawings of the dead bodies, was your first instinct to call the police and give it to us? Or did you sit on that information for a little bit of time? JEAN: Um I did, I went straight to the police. Okay that's good. Do you feel like you're in any kind of danger? You know, do you feel safe being where you're at? I do, no I do feel like I'm in danger, yes. Because I could have some police officers outside of your house, doing 24-hour surveillance, just for the fact that we all wanna protect you as well. But we also wanna see if he's gonna come back for any belongings, or to harm you, or whatever's going on in his mind. If something like that could be done, that would be amazing. We can definitely make that happen. Because if there's any possibility that he's gonna come back and try to harm you, or just try to come back to the house for any kind of belongings, we would want to be there, not only to protect you, but also to see if we can catch him, and put an end to his doings. Okay, thank you. Don't have fear today. Again, I would like to thank you for your time. Thank you. I'll show you out. So much. Right this way. Thank you so much. You have a good one, be safe. Find anything, please let me know. JEAN: Okay, thank you. (LIGHTER FLICKS ON) JACK: Wakey wakey, girls! (JACK LAUGHS) Oh, that's what happens when you run away from a clown car. You know, a long time ago, crazy used to be considered a real thing. Nowadays, everybody's considered crazy. My mom left me at an orphanage when I was 16. My mom sold my clothes, she sold everything I had. I'd get the shit kicked out of me every day. The world would just keep fucking watching. I ran, then I keep running. There's no catharsis. The evil never stops. I'm a mirror, and I am what you people made of me. (JACK LAUGHS) What am I, a demon? Or am I just some fucked up silly clown? I'd like to think I'm I am He, I am He! I am doing the fucking devil's work. (GIRL SCREAMS) (CHAINSAW ROARS) (GIRLS SCREAM) (VOICES ECHO) (CHAINSAW ROARS) Hello? Look motherfucker, you've already done this once. Quit calling my phone. (TRUCK DRIVES OFF) Where the hell is everybody? They've already came and went. What do you mean, they came and went? I debriefed them, they're gone. CHIEF: Why did you debrief them? Well, when I got here, when I got the call, I noticed you wasn't here, so I stepped in. We don't have any time to waste here. Robert, that's not how this works. We had no time to waste here, Chief all right? Listen man, I told you to stay in your lane. ROBERT: Stay in my lane, I know. You're not listening. This is personal for me. I wanna catch him just as bad as anybody else does. I wanna look that son of a bitch in the eyes, so he knows that I'm the one that did it. Listen man, I'm re-assigning you. I can't have this. Well if I'm off the case, then I'm off the force. I quit. (WATER SPLASHES) (PIANO MUSIC) ROBERT VOICEOVER: Over the last few years, I tried to move on. I did a damn good job too. Finding work was not easy, but I found honest work. That led to new friends, and eventually, to someone special. The phone calls stopped. Everything was great. (PIANO MUSIC) But evil never dies. I knew he was out there, and it burned me to my fucking core, that no one would stop him. It must not be the popular case anymore. No one cares about serial killers. It doesn't sell. The bastard found his loophole. Got out the radio again. Heard something about a guy working in an antique store. A few counties over. Matching what Jean said in those old tapes. I know it's him. (CAR HORN HONKS) Sir, can I help you? No. (PULSATING SOUND) (CHIMES RINGING) (JACK LAUGHS) (LAUGHTER ECHOES) (MULTIPLE VOICES OVERLAPPING)
