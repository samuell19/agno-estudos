Christmas is one of my favorite holidays! Mine too! It's almost as fun as... Halloween! Our family and friends will be here soon, so we need to hurry and finish the party preparations. Oh! [grunts] These twinkle lights are all tangled up. Oh, goodness! My mommy uses a special comb when my hair gets all tangly. I wish there was a special comb for untangling twinkle lights. Speaking of wishes... Have you thought about what to ask Santa when he comes to our party? -What? -Huh? Santa...? Is coming here...? To our school...? For our party? Of course. Santa and I are old, old friends. And he loves holiday parties. Oh! That reminds me. I should bake another batch of ginger snaps. Santa loves ginger snaps. Especially the ones with lemon icing. They're his favorite. I'm going to wish for a super high stack of pancakes! Taller than Igor! I'd like a beaded headdress. With lots of beads! I wish I had a bigger basket for my broomstick. Then Henri can bring a friend. I'd like a mermaid tail. In rainbow colors! I wish I had a new baseball bat. No, wait! A batball base! I wish that my cousin Vida could be here for Christmas. She lives far away, in Ciudad Monstruo, and I miss her. That's a nice wish, Lobo. I hope it comes true. Wait till you see the Christmas tree my dad and I picked out! It's in a really big planter. After Christmas, we can plant it outside, and have our very own Christmas tree all the time! All the time! How tall is it? Are the branches really bushy? Well, I didn't exactly see the tree, but the planter is huge. That sounds very exciting, Frankie. Ooh, and you know what else is exciting? Sun down... Monsters up! Drac! Katya. Lobo! [howls] Frankie! Zoe. [music] Cleo! Spike! [all] Super Monsters! OK, Super Monsters. Drac, Zoe, and I are organizing the decorations. Check! [grunting] Check! Igor, Lobo, Spike, and Cleo are in charge of snacks. Yay! I'm good at snacks! I like making them and eating them. I'm making everything punch! My mom let me borrow one of her cauldrons. And I know the recipe by heart. These sure look good. [Lobo sniffing] Yum! [children laughing] [wind blowing] I can't wait to put these ornaments on our Christmas tree! It sounds like Frankie found a really big tree. So we need to make a lot of ornaments. [Cleo and Zoe laughing] Spike. Want to taste the punch? [Spike gulps] Ah! It's really yummy. Thank you. Now, what color should I make it? Hmm... maybe green? That's Christmasey. But I want to make sure I add something for everyone. So maybe blue, for Hanukkah? Or red, for winter solstice? Or maybe green, blue, and red! Huh! It's purple. Cool! The tree is here! Wait 'till you see it! [loud thump] Huh? Umm... Where's the tree? Right there. Oh, it's so... small. Christmas trees are supposed to reach all the way up to the ceiling! Oh. But the planter was so big, and I thought it would be fine to put the tree in our garden after Christmas, and... We didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Frankie. Maybe it will look bigger if we decorate it! Well, it doesn't look any bigger... But it sure is tasty! I've got this! Holiday magic, give it your all, make something big from something so small! [all] Oh! Oh, bats! My witches magic won't work on plants. Maybe it just needs some water! Spike, will you help me? [Spike roars] [wind blowing] [Spike and Cleo gasp] OK, If we can't make the tree bigger-- We can still make it beautiful! [Zoe laughs] Tah-dah! [all] Oh! Oh, wow! There's a star on the tree! Oh, and there's a note with it! It's from Santa. Oh, he's sorry, but he won't be able to come to our party. Apparently, Santa and the elves still have a lot of giftwrapping to do. But he promises he'll be by to visit everyone later. And in the meantime, he sent us a Wish Star! What's a wish star? [chirping] A Wish Star is a very special ornament, it's made with Christmas magic, and it can grant one Christmas wish. But, how does it work? It's simple, all you have to do is hold the Wish Star in your hands, close your eyes and make a wish. Ha-ha, yeah! Cool! Igor, since Santa is your friend, this Wish Star must be for you! I already have everything I want. I can't think of a single thing to wish for. How about a trip to the moon? [Lobo howling] A giant castle made out of cookie dough! Or a magic cape, so you can fly, like me! Or, maybe a bigger Christmas tree? I wish I could wish for my cousin Vida to be here. Feliz Navidad, cousin Lobo! Vida! Surprise, mi'jito! You're here! You're really here! I'm here! I'm here! And I'm getting dizzy! Woah! Ha-ha-ha! Wow, that Wish Star sure worked fast. My Christmas wish came true before I even made my wish. Your father and I have been planning this for weeks. Hey, Lobo, we want to meet your cousin. Oh, for sure, for sure, for sure! Vida, this is Cleo, and Zoe, and Spike, and Drac, and Katya, and Frankie! [all] Hi, Vida! [Vida chuckles] Hi! Come on, I can't wait to show you everything. Hello, little tree. I know it's kind of small. We don't mind. We love tiny trees! And really big planters. This little tree is really happy, because it has lots of room to grow. [music starts] [tree grows] Wow! That's the biggest Christmas tree I've ever seen! Woo-ho-ho! How did you do that? Vida's Super-Monster's super-power is plant magic. Oh, wow! I've never met anyone with plant magic before. It's amazing. [everyone cheering] Gracias, Super Monsters! I love helping green things grow, and Lobo has told me that you like being helpful too! [everyone agrees] Whoopsie! [adults laughing] Dad! Dad! Wait 'till you see the tree! [Frankie] Tah-dah! Oh, wow! It seems so much bigger than I remember it! It certainly is big. And beautiful. But how are we going to get it into the classroom? I've got this! Perfect! [Glorb] Wow! He he he! Merry Christmas, Glorb.

[Glorb squeaks] [Glorb squeaks] [Henri meows] [Glorb squeaks] ♪ Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells ♪ Spike, would you and your mom like to come caroling after the party? Oh, can we, mom? Can we? Oh, absolutely! I love caroling. It's one of my favorite Christmas traditions. Wonderful! Igor and Esme are coming too! [Glorb sings "Jingle bells"] Yes, Glorb, of course. You can come too. [Glorb cheers] Are you coming to our winter solstice party tonight? My mom's brewing hot apple cider, and we're making ginger bread. Yummy! We'll be there! Right, daddy? Mhmm. Will we see you at the solstice celebration? You can bring Glorb. [Glorb squeaking] I do love hot apple cider. And I love home-made gingerbread. But we already have other plans. [Glorb squeaking] It's OK, Glorb. You can still go without us. [Glorb cheers] [Frankie] It's called a dreidel. I love spinning! Fast, fast, fast! [everyone laughing] Lobo! You're supposed to spin the dreidel, not yourself. Oh, oh, too spinney! Can't stop! -[Cleo gasps] -[wind blowing] [Lobo gasps] I like your wind powers. And I like your plant magic! And I like spinning like a Dreidel! Let's do it again! You should all come over to my house, we have a monster-sized dreidel. It's so fun! [Glorb singing] It sounds like fun, but we're having a tamale dinner at abuelita's house. Lobo, are you going to go too? Frankie! You know that abuelita's house is my house too. Of course I'm going, and I can't wait to eat lots and lots of tamales! Cleo! You should come for tamales! Thanks, Vida, but we're going to Frankie's house. Mrs. Mash is going to teach us how to make latkes. Why isn't Albert at our party? Albert and his family are watching Christmas movies while they wait up for Santa to come! [Glorb cheers] I was thinking, it would be fun to wait for Santa on the roof, with the gargoyles! Drac! Your mother will be very disappointed if you miss the Vampire Ball. Oh, I'm definitely going to the Vampire Ball. I've been practicing my moves all week! -♪ One, two, cha-cha-cha ♪ -[Glorb imitates] [Glorb sings] You have a recipe for fruit cake pizza? [Glorb cheers] Are you sure you can't come over for tamales? I've been cooking all week. And I made some special cheese tamales for you, Glorb. [speaking Spanish] Tamales, oh, sí, sí. I do love tamales, but I've already planned a pajama party at the petting zoo. And the monster pets are so excited. [Glorb chirping] Of course you can come to the pajama party, Glorb. But then, you'll miss out on abuelita's cheese tamales. [Glorb squeaking] There are so many fun things happening tonight. It's too bad we can't be everywhere at the same time. Indeed! So, Glorb. What have you decided to do? Pajama party, or tamales? Or would you like to come caroling with us? [Glorb squeaking] [Glorb squeaking] [Glorb squeaking] [Glorb chuckling] [Glorb laughing] Oh, oh! Tah-dah! [Glorb singing] Glorb! I'm so glad you decided to come caroling. I know it was a hard decision to make. [Glorb agrees] Tamales! [Glorb squeaking] Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel!
