(thunder rumbling) (gentle acoustic music) - Now, miss. (grunts) Let's go. (knocking on door) I'm not ready yet. Going somewhere nice? - Better than nice. And, uh, take your time. No need to hurry. - You said you were gonna book for 7:30. - Yeah, I booked for 9:00 instead. - We're an hour and a half early. - That's an hour and a half to fill in. - Donny! (laughs) - The kid asleep? (laughs) (sighs) - You're my girl. (Donny sighs) (Marge giggles) (Donny laughs) (pot clangs) - What's that? - [Mac] Marge? (door lock clicks) - It's him! - Jesus Christ! (door thuds) - What's goin' on? - Donny? (pot clangs) - Donny Carol. - [Marge] Don't you touch him, Macauley! - That's it, Donny, get your strides on. - [Donny] Don't do anything stupid Macauley. - [Mac] I'm gonna take you apart. - You leave him alone, Macauley. - Shut up! (grunts) - You bastard! (groans) - [Tony] Get off me! (groans) (grunts) (breathing heavily) - [Marge] Please. - When did I ever. - [Buster] Ma? Mommy? (Buster groans softly) Mama? - What'd you give her to make her like this? - [Marge] Just aspirin. (breathing heavily) (Buster whines) - That's brandy, ya bitch. (grunts) I can't leave her in a brothel, can I? (pot clangs) - Where are you going? Macauley! Macauley! Mac! Mac, don't do this! Mac, I'll come to the border! I'll follow you around! You were right. I'm a lousy wife, you're a lousy husband. We're made for each other. You leave me now, Macauley, I'll get you! You'll wish you were dead! (dog barking) (train creaking) (train whistle blows) (Buster groans softly) - It's okay. - Who are you? - I'm your dad. - Oh, yeah. I've got a picture of you. You come and visit us. - Yeah, I come and visit you. I'm your dad. - What is this? - A train. We're on a train ride. - Where's Mom? - Your mom's no good. Forget her. - I want Mom. - You can't have her. - I want mom. - [Woman] It's all right, kid. - You're not my mom. - I know, dear. Nevermind. There you are. - Not on train. - Yes, dear. - I want Mama. - Just go to sleep. That's it. (people laughing) - Hey, uh, my turn. - Hey, Donny. Be my guest. - That's all right. (laughing) - That was very generous of you, Mac. - Last dance he'll get with her. You're gonna have to get yourself another fighter, mate. Marge and me are gonna get married, go to the city. - That such a good idea, Mac? (match strikes) I mean, Marge is a nice kid, a pretty kid. But living in the city, is that what you want? - She wants to be near her mother. - She's very young. This is very sudden. - Look, the only woman I've ever wanted to marry is married. I recon Marge and me can make a go of it. - That's no way to go into marriage. - [Mac] We can't all be Romeo and Juliette, like you two. - Don't do this, Mac. - It's done. I made her a promise. That's it. - Where's this? (train whistle blowing) - Beltana. Now, come on. - Where's all the people? Where are we going? - Shut up and walk. - I know where we're going. We're going to see your mom. Aren't we? We're going to see your mommy! - You don't want to see your mom. She's no good to you, I told you that. She's useless. Come on. (birds chirping) - [Woman] Maybe some toast. (diners chatting) There you are. - I hate flakes. - Everyone likes corn flakes. Look. Good oil. - Hate 'em! - You eat your corn flakes, or I'll smack your ears loose. - You got a sore hand. How'd you get a sore hand? - From hitting the last bloke who didn't eat his corn flakes. - You didn't hit him. - I hit him. Eat 'em! (gentle music) (goats bleating) Like walking with a flamin' mushroom. - Where are we going now? - Out there. - What for? - Find work. - Why? - If I don't work, we don't eat. (dramatic music) (goats bleating) (cows mooing) - [Cowhand] Get her right, will ya? (cows mooing) Got him! - "Stop that," said the cow. "Leave me alone." - [Cowhand] Watch him. - [Cowhand] Bring him down. (cows mooing) (cowhand groans) (cows moos in distress) - [Cowhand] Come on, Mac, get the iron over here. (cows mooing) - No, Daddy! - [Cowhand] Do it fast! (shouting) (cow moos in distress) - What the hell? - My bloody leg! (groans) (Buster cries) - Thanks. Stop dawdling. - I'm tired. Carry me. I'm not coming, you rotten old dad! Dad! - Snake. Where is it! - Here it is, Daddy. It's a caterpillar. - A bloody caterpillar. Stone me, don't you know those things can sting ya? - Can I keep it, Dad? So, where we going now? I wonder how many of them sheeps there. Whoa, listen to that cow. (gentle music) - Hey, Cheetham! - Hey, Mac. Come in, come in. - Caterpillar wants his dinner. - Tell him to tie a knot in his gut. - Ow. (pots clank) - Come in, come in. - I'm trying, I'm trying. (gentle music) How's it for camping out in the back? (gentle music) Good night. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) - We got any paper? (sighs) - Why didn't you go before? - Didn't need to. Ta. - Not here. Go behind a bush somewhere. - But it's dark out there. Might be, things. - Do what you're bloody told. (crickets chirping) - Daddy! - Found another caterpillar? (breathing frantically) What's the matter? You been bitten? What? What are you saying? - My caterpillar. - What about him? - Gone! Where's he gone? - Probably gone off somewhere to go to sleep. You can get yourself another one in the morning. - I don't want another one! I want my caterpillar. Shop. My caterpillar's in the shop. - Oi! We can't get Cheetham out of bed at this time of night. We'll go there in the morning. - Put me down! - Your caterpillars in the shop, he'll still be there then. - I wanna go to the shop! (grunts) - [Mac] Now, be a good girl. (groans defiantly) - Want my caterpillar! - Here. Have a lolly. Eat a bloody lolly. (groans) Now, go to sleep. No more nonsense. (crickets chirping) (sticks snaps) (breathing heavily) (Buster eating loudly) - A bloke should have his head examined. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (rooster crows) - Go to shop. - Hm? - Get my caterpillar. (groans) - Morning. - Just. It's only first light. The flamin' sun isn't up yet. - You said morning. - Shop isn't even open. - Aw. (rooster crows) - Breakfast first, then shop. - But-- - Don't argue. Now, go and get some sticks for the fire. We can't even start. (birds chirping) (pot clanks) - [Buster] Ow! Oh, thanks! Daddy! Look, Dad! - You want that? What's the damage? - Do me a favor, Mac. Let the kid take a g'day. It lowers the tone of the place. - All right, only if you carry it yourself. See ya, Cheetham. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - What's he doing? - Looking for food. - Did he get his dinner? Can I have mine? - Show me you can walk a bit further. (goats bleating) A ride! Come on, before they shoot through. Come on, it's a ride! - [Buster] Hang on! - Hey, Thad you old bastard! Bloody hell. Lily, how are ya? - Mac, you old bastard. If you know anything about gearboxes, come and give us a hand, will ya. - [Mac] Yeah, sure. (grunts) - Here. - Ooh, your dad must've put this one on. (sighs) How's Jim? - He's dead. - Dead? - A couple'a years back, felling a tree. - I'm sorry. Was a good bloke. - Yeah. I never heard. How's Thad? (sighs) - Dying. Cancer's got him. If he'd been a horse, I'd a shot him six months back. Mac, I don't need your sympathy. I need the truck to work. I'm sorry, I'm tired. I've been runnin' the place on my own. Morning. - Good morning. (grunts) - Gooby wants to help. - Who the hell's Gooby? Oh. - Who's your little friend, Mac? - My daughter, Buster. - Oh. Lily. - How do you do, Lily. - Very well, thank you, Buster. - Like a flamin' tea party. (grunts) - Where's your mom? - Mom's useless. We don't want her. - Oh. - [Mac] Try it now! - Beauty. (engine revving) (chickens clucking) Dad? I brought you a visitor. Remember Macauley? - [Thad] Ah, yes, Mac. - Come and help me feed the chicks. (chickens clucking) (door creaks) - Good to see you, Thad. - Sorry I put you on the train. - Best day's work you ever done. - Was it? A bit of a spark went out of Lil that day. Never come back. Was that a kid I saw? - Mm, mine. - Don't see you with a kid at foot. - Not many people do. - You married? - We left her. (inhales deeply) (sighs) - Mac, I got maybe two months left in me. And Lil is a widow now. She's gonna need a bloke about the place. - You haven't seen me in 15 years, Thad. You don't know what I'm like. I couldn't work for a woman, and that's flat. - [Lily] Really? - [Buster] Bye-bye, little chicky. (Lily giggles) (Lily chatting) (chickens clucking) - Okay. You like raising chicken? - Yeah. - And of course, I thought it was a bloody snake. (laughs) - Well, I reckon she's lovely. - Yeah, she's not a bad kid. (gentle music) (chuckles softly) - Dad says you won't work for a woman. - Yeah, that's right. Not unless I was down to my last razoo. Even then, I doubt it. (laughs softly) I couldn't work for you. - What? - It's all still there. (gentle music) - You're a married man. - She's a tart. She's got another bloke. Yeah. I'm a married man. (dramatic music) - Shearing starts soon. Thad's still alive. You'd be working for him. - We'd only be trouble for each other. - Honestly, Mac. I know your irresistible to women, but get it in your head. I don't need you. I don't need you to work for me. I don't need you to run the place. I don't need, that. I had a good husband, I buried him. That part of my life's over. You want a job, you've got it. You don't, goodbye. - I'd better get to bed. - Got to be in Nilpena early tomorrow morning. See about a job. (dramatic music) - You got a brown chook, and you got a black chook, and you got lots of white chooks. - [Thad] Yeah, I like a lot of chooks. - You sick? - [Thad] Yeah, I'm sick. - You look sick. - [Thad] Well, that's 'cause I am sick. - You got a cold? - Yeah. Bad cold. - Did you know that people die? - Yes, I had heard that. - My granny died, Mom's mom. We can't visit her anymore, and that's why. - Yeah, well, when people die they're not around anymore. You can't visit them. - But why? - 'Cause they're in Heaven, or Purgatory, or Hell. - Where's that? - Hasn't Macauley told you anything? - No. - Buster! Come on. Time to hit the road. - See ya, Mr. Thad. - Hey, Mac. She doesn't know anything about Heaven and Hell. - Don't know much about it myself, Thad. See ya. (door creaks) - See ya both. - [Buster] Bye, Lily. - [Lily] Goodbye, Buster. (gentle music) - You look like you could use a hand. - Yes, but... She yours? - Yeah. - Ah, thing about too much trouble, mate. Sorry. (birds cawing) (gentle music) - [Farmer] Look, I've already told ya, mate. I'm sorry, but I can't help ya. We can't have a kid hangin' around. (rooster crows) (sheep bleating) (dog barking) - Did you get the job, Dad? Huh? - What do you think? (gentle music) (thunder rumbling) - I like it here, Dad. It's nice. (gentle music) (rain pattering) (sighs) (thunder rumbling) - If it wasn't for you and your mother, a bloke could get some work. I'd do better than a loaf of bread and a couple of pies. (rain pattering) Come on. Up. Walked in worse than this. If it wasn't for you, a bloke would be out in it. You don't walk, you don't get where you're goin'. (gentle music) (groans softly) (people chatting) - Look, baby horses. - That's a donkey, that one. - Oh. - That's a pony. - They talk. - [Mac] Yeah, sort of. (carnival music) - Look, Dad! Can I ride? - Now, don't get carried away. I'm looking for work. - Can I have one, what is it? - Fairy. - [Stella] The frilliest, the dilliest little dollies in the show today. - Stella? - G'day, Mac. Long time no see. - [Mac] Been a few years, yeah. - She yours? - [Mac] Uh-huh. - She looks just like Marge. Here you are, love. - [Mac] What I owe ya? - On the house, Mac. - [Mac] Thanks. Thank Stella. - Thanks, Stella. - Bye-bye, love. - See you around. - Bye. Here, Dad. - [Stella] How's Marge? - She's all right. - [Stella] Get to your bag. - How are ya, mate? - [Mac] Pretty good. How are you? - Real good, Mac. (chuckles) - [Announcer] Roll up, roll up, ladies and gentlemen. Come and see the most amazing-- - [Buster] That lady's got pictures on her. - [Mac] Uh-huh. - Oh, G'day, Mac! - [Mac] G'day, Kitty. (sighs excitedly) (exotic music) - Is this her? - Buster. (sneezes) - God bless you, Buster, darling. (laughs) Hey, hey. Come and say hello. - [Mac] I will. (exotic music) (drum beating) - Who'll take a glove now? Who'll take a glove? Two more to match before we step inside and watch the boys in action. Best money's worth on the showground today. - I'll have a go at the muck. (crowd cheers) - Yes, people! Give him a big hand, ladies and gentlemen. (crowd applauds) I'll make do with Lenny here. Watch out though, he's due for a win. - Easy way to make a quid. - You hear that, Lenny? Reckons it's an easy way to make a quid. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Who'll take a glove against my final fistic fanatic? - I'll take you on, you old rooster! (crowd laughs) - [Spectator] Whoa! - There's no suicides here, sir. It's against my religion. - Go on, put the gloves on yourself, you old bugger! (crowd cheers) - Macauley! - Beauty! - Mac! (crowd applauds) Get yourself up here, son! (crowd applauds) Ladies and gentlemen, this here is Macauley. He could've been the light heavyweight champion of Australia. (crowd murmurs) Who'll take a glove against Macauley? - Hey, fair go, Beauty. - Don't worry, Mac. There's a quid in it. - I got me kid with me, I can't. - Kitty'll look after her. Who'll fight Macauley in the main even? - Yeah, I'll have him. (crowd cheers) He's long in the tooth though, isn't he. - [Beauty] You hear that, Mac? - You be good, and I'll take you to visit the lady with the pictures on her. And she'll look after ya, while I hammer this drongo into the ground like a tank. (crowd cheers) - Well, we got ourselves a great match. Shake hands, boys. It won't be long before we come out fighting. - And Macauley putting the combinations together now. Whoa! One of those connects, you'll find Macauley's head in the horse pavilion. And here he goes, and it's good night nurse! Good fight, son. Get yourself trained, you can be contender. And now, ladies and gentlemen, our next fantastic fight is between two battlin' bruisers from the back plots. Good on ya, son. Two angry assassins in, help him out, will ya, Johnny. Two angry assassins in silk. Stick around for the next fight. - No, I can't, mate. I gotta go and see how the kid is. (door opens) (carnival music) (coughing) - S'pose you won, did ya? - Yeah. - She's sick. - She'll be all right. Tough as old boots. - You wanna stay here, or... - What happened to Greg Forenzo? - Shot through with a half man, half woman. (laughs softly) He's a woman. - What about the mustache? - Glue, mate. - And a dozen other beauties. - Hm. (sighs) No, leave her. Leave her, Mac. I'll look after her. (carnival music) (people chattering) Always wanted a little girl of me own. - You sure you won't come, Mac? - No, I'll be right. I'm real sorry about Ruby. Just heard too late to get to the funeral. - Oh, I miss her, Mac. If you ever get through Nilpena, you could weed her grave for me. - Of course I will. - Good on ya, Mac. - Well done, Mac. - Thanks, boys. - Marge reckons you'd shove now. I've got a note. There's a letter inside for you. She reckoned we'd bump into each other. - Crawling to get her kid back. You told me Marge was no good for me. Ruby told me the same thing, but I bloody knew best, didn't I? Ha! Sent her every quid I ever earned. Got to town whenever I could. - How long did ya last in town after the wedding? - Couple of months. Stayed a whole month longer than I wanted to, for her sake. I told her straight. I gotta go, or I'll go stark raving mad. She's says okay, then she turns around and she takes up with another bloke. Took the kid to spite her. - Can't be easy, Mac. Getting your kind of work with a kid at your heels. - Like fighting with two hands tied behind your back. - [Beauty] Why don't you put her in a home? Get someone to look after her. - Yeah, I reckon it's come to about that. - Maybe should send her back to Marge. - Yeah, why not? Kid'd be all she'd have. (flies buzzing) - Why don't you get your bloody shirt on, come and have a drink with a man. - Nah. - Suit yourself. (somber music) - [Marge Voiceover] I hope this finds you, because I want you to know a few things. You thought I'd come crawling after you for the kid, didn't you? You thought I couldn't get along without her. Fat lot you knew, you bastard. You have a turn with her and see how you get along. See how she gets on your nerves for a change. Don't come back here. I don't want to see either of you again. (somber music) You ruined my life, but thank God a good man has come into it now. You hurt Donny. You broke his jaw and smashed his ribs. And he could go at you through the court, but he's too big a man for that. (somber music) He's a gentleman compared to you. He's kind and thoughtful, and you're nothing but a selfish brute, and you always will be. I wasn't right in the head when I married you. Donny and me will be married just as soon as the divorce is through. I can nail for desertion. But don't think I'm finished with you yet. I'm not. One day, I'm gonna get you, if it's the last thing I do. You mongrel. I hope you die. You're faithfully, Marge. (somber music) (crickets chirping) (chickens clucking) - You stay here. (pots clanging) (chickens clucking) (birds chirping) (whines softly) - What's this? Two visits in 15 years? - How's Thad? - The same. Thanks. - Job offer still open? - Naturally. Down to your last razoo? - You don't take everything I say so seriously, do you? - Team's due in tonight. - Good oil. Get the best hut while the going's good. - Buster worn out, is she? - [Mac] She's fine, thanks. (pots clang) - I feel funny. (groans) I'm sick. - Come on, over. A little of this. - What's that? - It's good stuff. It'll make you better. - It smells. - Yeah, but it'll fix you up. Gotta get you better. - Oh, by the way, Macauley's come to work for us. - I heard. Must be desperate. - Must be. - Or in love. - Never heard you use that expression. - I used it a lot of times. To your mother mostly. - Hm. - Are you in love with him? - We're grown ups, dad. - Oh, grown up doesn't inoculate you against it. Grown up can be pretty bleak without it. - I don't have time to listen to nonsense. Need anything? - But you might. - Hm. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) (shearer whistling) (clippers buzzing) (raspy breathing) (engine revving) (dog whining) - [Shearer] You right? (dog whining) - [Mac] Buster? - Be quiet. She's sleeping. - [Mac] What's she doing here? - She's sick. - She was all right where she was. - She was not! She has the flu badly! She needs care. - Are you telling me I don't know how to look after my own kid? - Yes, Mac. That is precisely what I'm saying. You don't know how to look after your own child! She shouldn't be sleeping by roadsides and in shearer's huts! By rights, she should be in hospital! - Rights! I got every right to look after my kid the way I see fit. And you've got no right. Nobody's got the right to tell me what to do! - Mac, you need help! - I do not need help! I don't need anybody's help! - She can stay here in the house, or you can both go. She's got influenza! If the shearers catch it, I'm finished! You can stay here, or you can both go. - That's it, isn't it? It's the bloody money! - That is a lie, and you know it. Yes, go on, Mac, punch me. Someone disagrees with you, and you punch them. That's how you do it, isn't it? So, go on. - I'll take her, and then we'll go. - If you camp out with her tonight, she will die. - You give her to me now. - I'll give her to you if you spend another night in the hut, not unless. I will not have Buster's blood on my hands. (somber music) (crickets chirping) - [Shearer] Recon we oughta help Mac? - [Shearer] Nah. Nah, I saw what happened to the last bloke who tried to help Mac when he didn't need helping. (match strikes) - [Shearer] Yeah? (fire crackling) (Buster moans softly) (breathing heavily) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - Here. Just a little. (mumbles) Yeah, it's good for you. - There's flame at the top of the chimney. - Shut the door! - What the hell are you trying to do? - Shut the bloody door! I'm trying to sweat the fever out of her before you chuck us of the place tomorrow. - Oh, don't be so ridiculous. I'm the one that wants to get the child to hospital. Macauley, you could kill her like this. You know that. We've both seen grown men die from this sort of old wives' cure. - If I don't sweat the fever out of her, she'll get pneumonia on the road and die anyway. - That'd solve a lot of problems for you, wouldn't it? You couldn't be blamed. You'd be the poor sad father who's child happened to die, and you'd be rid of her. (Lily sighs) You'd have your life to yourself again. - Get out. Get bloody out! - She'd better not die, Macauley. (dramatic music) - Yeah. You're right. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) How do you feel? - Thirsty. - Fever's gone. - It was hot last night. - Yeah. - Where's Gooby? - You gotta look after him better. He hasn't got anyone else to look after him. You don't look after him, anything could happen. He could die, anything. How's he now? - Good. Not sick anymore. - Right. You make sure you look after her. - Gooby's not a girl. He's a he, you know. - Yeah, that's what I meant. - You made me better, didn't you, Daddy? - Shut up. You talk too bloody much. (gentle music) - Here's some tucker, and the blokes took the hat around. - I'll take the tucker. Thanks. - What are you gonna do? - Got people I know out Hawker way. Live with them, I reckon. - Best. - Oi. - Mornin', love. You look pretty as a picture. - Come on. (gentle music) We're right-oh. (grunts) (gentle music) - I'm going to town, Dad. - [Thad] Give my regards to Macauley. - Macauley? Shouldn't think it'd see him. (Thad chuckles) (vehicle approaching) - I don't want any favors. - [Lily] I want to make sure you're leaving. I'll take you to the railhead. - I'll pay ya. - [Lily] Just shut up and get in, will ya? You talk too much. (laughing) - [Buster] Gooby likes you. - Hm. - Gooby likes you too, Dad. - Gooby's got very broad tastes. (birds chirping) - [Mac] Hey! You old bag of bones! - God, stone the crow. Me and the cow were just talking about you the other night? - You talk to a cow? - How are ya? - All right! - And how's Bella? - Lost a bit of weight. - Really? Very good. (laughs) - Hey, Bella! Come and see what I found! (screams) - What are you doing, you great lug! Where have you been? - Hey, Bella. How are ya? - What are you doing? Trying to sneak through town without seein' us, you wretch? - [Mac] Not much chance of that. - Hello, darling! Oh! Yours and Marge's? - Mine. - Bella, this is Gooby. - That's his name. - [Luke] Oh, I thought he was Buster. - No, I'm Buster. - Oh, my darling! My sweetheart! My poor little dear! What do you think of my Lukey? Isn't he looking well? Oh, Mac. (giggles) - She's a lot quieter than usual, mate. She's not off her tucker, is she? (chuckles) - I won't have your father take you back on the road until my cherub's been made strong and healthy with roasties and roly-polys. (giggles) Isn't that right, Mac? - Yeah, that's right, Bella. Now, you be careful with that kid, Bella. She'll break with all that handling. - Not like me, with rubber bones and numb nerves. (Bella giggles) - [Bella] Isn't he a funny old bugger, my Lukey? - Yeah, we'll get rid of these and have a drink. - Now, I don't do any washing, sling 'em out. Girl will be here in the morning. - Thanks. Oi! Stop that. You'll smash the mattress. - I like this place. Do we live here now? - As long as you like, my cherub. Come on, you come with me. - Go on, off it. (Bella giggles) (batter sizzles) - Like that. Now, come on. Show me. (batter sizzles) (inhales deeply) - Beautiful. Now another. (chuckles) - How's it for work around here? - See John Cameron. - I know him, do I? - We'll find him around the pub. (rooster crows) - After breakfast, we'll make a cake together. - [Mac] All right, I'll see you this afternoon. - Where we going? - [Mac] You're gonna eat the nice breakfast Auntie Bella's cooked for you, and I'm going to work. - I'm coming. - No, you're not. - I wanna come! - You're gonna get cut in half, blood an guts all over the place. Stay! - Mm, got daddy's temper, all right. - My daddy's got a bigger temper than that. (laughs) (gentle music) - Open wide. - When's Dad-- - Coming home. For the 21st time, cherub, when he finishes work. One more. Oh! - [Buster] Dad! Daddy! - What the hell have you been drinking? You smell bloody awful. - Medicine. - Flung herself off the steps. Flung herself straight off the steps into her arms-- - [Mac] Anyone home? - Oh, yes, you found her. - Yep. Sure did. - Doctor called, gave her something for the cough. - And he said what she really needs is rest. - [Mac] What, not walking the roads? - She needs to stay in bed like she's told instead of galloping around. "Where's Dad? "When's Dad coming home?" Trouble is you're daddy's little girl, aren't you? (giggles) Where daddy goes, you have to go. (giggling) - That child loves you. - What about the (mumbles), let's play some reg-ohs. - She loves you with every ounce of love in her body, the precious little darling. - Tell me where it is, I'll go and get it. - She's right, you know, mate. - Giving her milk custards, broth. She laps 'em up like a little angel. - You're not careful, you'll have her as healthy as you are. Then you'll have trouble. With me, I mean. (laughs) - Isn't he a funny old bugger, my Lukey? (laughs) - We're not gonna play reg-ohs, we're gonna play cards? - Sorry, Mac. Mm, pass. (crickets chirping) She really loves you. (fork scrapes) - [Mac] Another day, another quid. See you all this evening. - Bye. - See you, Mac. (birds chirping) (Bella humming) - He's forgotten. - [Bella] Forgotten what, lovey? - My birthday. - No! No, he's playing a game with you, cherub. He's pretending he's forgotten. Daddies don't forget their little girl's birthdays. - No. (birds chirping) - [Bella] Mac? Down here in the kitchen. You ready? - Ready for what? - Well, what do you think of your little daughter now? - Looks okay. - Just okay? You bought it for her. - You like it? - Thanks, Dad. - You smuggled it in and gave it to me, and said, "Make sure she's wearing "this when I get home on her birthday? "Because I'm going to pretend I've forgotten." - It didn't work. I knew you'd remembered. - [Luke] Well, what are you gonna say to her now? - How old's that make ya? (crickets chirping) - How could you forget? - What sort of a father forgets his daughter's birthday? - I didn't forget. I just bloody never knew. Thanks. (crickets chirping) Look, if you got a minute, I've got a bit of a proposition. I'm gonna head down Quorn way. Hunt up some work. I was wondering... Seeing as how well Buster gets along here with the pair of ya, maybe... - You're gonna have to say it, Mac. - I was wondering if you wouldn't mind keeping her here for a while. - Mind? I've been feeling sick at the though of her going. Oh, I would've missed her something dreadful. I got so fond of her. She can stay here as long as you like. She can stay here forever! (giggles) We'll keep the little darling if you sell her. (giggles) - It'll give me a chance to get some work behind me. Get flush. Work out what the best thing to do is. - And you can visit. - Often as I can, yeah. - You could even settle down somewhere. (liquid pouring) - Tried that. - Mm. (inhales sharply) Mightn't be easy. She mightn't want to stay. - Shouldn't be any trouble, not the way you two hit it off. - Will you tell her? - Yeah. But I'll wait 'til the last minute. - [Bella] When will you leave? - Saturday night. After she's gone to bed. (laughs excitedly) (birds chirping) (dishes scraping) - [Buster] Another day, another quid. - Saturday. (dishes clanking) - Dad? Daddy! (footsteps stomping) Are we going? - We're not. - What are you doing it up for then? - Doing what? - What about my clothes? - Just sorting a few things out. (birds chirping) (crickets chirping) - [Buster] Where you going? - You should be asleep. - You're going away! - Just for a while. - No! - Just for a while. I'll be back. - You won't! I come too! - No, I don't want any carryon. Just stay here. - No! I'll be going with you. I'm coming. Daddy! (banging on door) Daddy! Daddy! Dad! Daddy! Dad! (dramatic music) Daddy! (crickets chirping) (dog barking) (pots clanging) (crying) Dad! Dad! Daddy! (frogs croaking) (pots clanging) Daddy! (footsteps running) Daddy! (Buster crying) (creek trickling) Daddy! Dad! Dad! - Why do you? (frogs croaking) Buster! (Buster shouts) (footsteps running) (breathing frantically) - Oh, daddy. - What are you dong here? Didn't I tell you to stay with Auntie Bella? - I wanna go with you. - Stop bawlin'. (cries) - You said you wouldn't leave me. - Oh, quit it! Look! Didn't Auntie Bella give you nice tucker to eat? (crying) Didn't she give you a nice bed to lie in? And a cat to play with? (crying) When did I ever give you that? - I wanna be with you. (crying) - I'm not leaving ya! I'm just going to get a job! I was gonna come and see ya. - You never came and saw mom! You'll never come and see me! (crying) Don't leave me! I won't give up! I want to stay with you, Daddy! (crying) - Oh, strike, I don't know. (crying) (dramatic music) - [Luke] Looks like she found you all right. - I don't wanna go with you. - Shush. - We can take her back. - Yeah, she'll tame down in a couple of day. - Or run away again. - You shut up. - [Luke] Welp. What's it gonna be, Mac? - Well... I reckon I'll get by somehow. Sorry you had all this bother. - See. Go away, funny old bugger. Go away, my Lukey. - Oh, that's charming, that is. All right, I know when I'm not wanted. - Good bye, my cherub. See ya soon. - [Mac] Thanks. - [Luke] Oh, God. Waterworks for a week. (somber music) - Fair dinkum, I don't know what I'm gonna do with you. - You should've left me. - Oh, for crying out loud. I was just looking for work. - [Buster] You had a job. - Yeah, well, I couldn't stay there. - [Buster] Why? - Christ. - Because why? (mumbles) (gentle music) - Bell, stay out of it. You don't know what happened. (pen scratching) You don't even know her. Now, Bella, I'm serious. If you write another word, I'm not gonna let you cuddle me anymore. (pen scratching) Do you hear me? - This is what we're saying. Dear Marge, We've never met, but we're friends of Mac's. Just a note to let you know that Mac and Buster have been staying with us and they're both fine. We just saw them off to Quorn. In case you were worrying, Buster's looking terrific and having a bonzer time. Trusting you are well in yourself. We remain yours truly, Mr. and Mrs. Luke Sweeney. - I'm not signing it. - You already have. (birds chirping) (pans clank) - You're a mean, nasty, old dad. - That's what you think. - You never leave me again, see. - Why, what will you do? - I'll run away. - You do that, and you mightn't find me again. - I'll walk along the roads, and on the roads, keep going on the roads, 'cause I know you always walk along the roads, and I'll find ya! - Come on, hurry up. (gentle music) (birds chirping) Yeah, well, it won't happen again. - It better not. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Ma'am? Wondering if you could tell us where we might find a boarding house. (birds chirping) (chatting distantly) Right, thanks. Thank you.

Mommy and me got things to talk about. - I want my child. - That's not what you said in your letter. - I was angry. I was wanting to hurt you. But I want my child. - So, you sneaked in and stole her. - You stole her from me in the first place, remember? - Oh, yeah, I remember. Reminds me of a French post card every time I think about it. I took her out of the brothel, and you're trying to put her back into one. - She needs her mother. - A mother? Is that what you call yourself, a mother? - Of course, you're so clean and holy. Such a saint. - I'm no saint. I never said I was. But I did the right thing by you, and it wasn't easy. - Trying to tell me you were faithful? - Yeah. Bloody mug, wasn't I? And I sent you money, and you never knocked it back. Food, clothes. You never went short of the rent. Always your bloody breadwinner. - It was your responsibility. - Then it was your responsibility to see you deserved it. - Money every week, and I'm supposed to be grateful? Do you think that's all there is to being a husband? Do you know how much married life I had with you? Six months! - Dad. Dad. Gooby's got a blood nose. - You left me alone with her while you walked that road of yours. - Alone with her? If it was that tough, then why take her back? By heavens, you must have it in for me. You don't want the kid. You don't give a damn about her. Just as long as I get hurt. That's it, isn't it? - She's not your child. You're not the father. - He is! - Her clothes back at Mrs. Weiss's, are they? - You've got no right to her! - You are my dad. - Come on, tiger. (somber music) She can keep this dress, can she? Present from her mother? - I'll get her back! You'll see! I haven't finished yet! I haven't even started! (somber music) - Bye, Marge. (crying) (birds chirping) (somber music) - Where we going, Dad? - Away. (somber music) (bird chirping) (crickets chirping) - Dad? - [Mac] Yeah. - What would happen if the sky fell on you? - Who cares? Go to sleep.

(distant radio chattering) - That's a pony. - Yeah, little horse. - No, pony. - Not a bad looking pony you got back there. (radio chattering) - Yeah, he's cheap too. - [Radio announcer] In the previous month. Estimated values-- - Not a bad sooky. - Aw, I took that to cover a debt. I'd have to get me money back. - [Mac] How much? (radio chattering) - Seven quid. - I'll give ya five. - Well, I got a full set of harnesses in there. I'll chuck that in for right. - [Radio Announcer] Brought to you by J&M Harvey.

(radio chattering) (birds chirping) - What'll we call him, Dad? - How 'bout Windbag? (birds chirping) (gentle music) (speaking foreign language) (pony nickers) - Amen. - Amen. - [Mac] Amen. - What men? - [Mac] I'll tell you later. - Gooby, there's men in there. They can't see, and they can't hear. They're like logs of wood. - [Mac] Shh. It's Uncle Thad in there. (speaking foreign language) - Six foot and dead in the grave is a better woman than our mom'll ever be. (spanking) - [Buster] Ow! (crying) (gentle music) - [Lily] G'day, Buster. - That's a bad father. - [Lily] You want me to sort him out? - I want you to whack him. (giggles) - I got a note from Dad. It's anything like the one he left me, I reckon he was senile at the end. (gentle music) (rips envelope) - Dear Mac, see you in Hell. In the meantime, marry Lily. - Senile. - Yep. - Neither of us need a cross like that, do we, Mac? - Hell, no. - I'll see you around. Ta. Thanks, Buster. (gentle music) (pony nickers) - You go? (gentle music) (crickets chirping) - Dad? - Huh? - I'll go and get some sticks for the fire. - Mm. - Wee! (crickets chirping) - Hungry, fella? (pony nickers) (car horn honks) (tires screech) (dramatic music) Buster! (dramatic music) Buster. Buster. (breathing heavily) (dramatic music) You're all right. (dramatic music) (coughing) (fly buzzing) (sighs) (footsteps approaching) - Mr. Macauley. - What do you know? - Well, we're going to have to operate. - Don't come at it like a bloody old woman. What are her chances? - She's in bad shape. If there are any relatives you want to hear, you better inform them. - You're licked before you started. You do something. You got her dead and in a coffin! Now, do something! - Just accept the reality, Mr. Macauley. We'll do all we can. I'll get the nurse to give you something to settle your nerves. - Nevermind me! You just make her better! Listen! You just go your hardest and give her a chance. She's a tough little bugger, and she'll do the rest. - She's already proved that. By all the rules, she ought to be dead now. (somber music) - [Officer] Mr. Macauley. - Yeah? - How's your daughter? - They're operating. - Fine. I need a description of the car. - It was modern, Yank job. Chev, Plymouth, something like that. - Number plate? - Don't know. - See the driver? - No. - Well, we can check around. May have been some damage to the car. Blood, something like that. Want anyone informed? - For what it's worth, yeah. Her mother, Mrs. Margaret Macauley. (pen scratching) (somber music) (crickets chirping) (frogs croaking) (birds chirping) - She's still unconscious, but she is hanging on. - Look, I'm sorry I bit your head off yesterday. Don't hold it against me, ey. - I'd forgotten. Get some sleep. - Yeah, I'll get camped out somewhere, come back. - I said get some sleep. - I heard what you said. (birds chirping) (clears throat) - Mr. Macauley. - Yeah? - For you. - What is it? - Now, I'm a solicitor, Mr. Macauley. Bathgate, from Wilson, Bathgate, and Wilson here in Wilmington. Your wife has made an application to the court for the custody of your child. - What are you talking about? - This is notice of when the application will be heard. - She's lying in there three quarters blood dead. - Yes, uh, I heard. I'm sorry. - I tell her about Buster, and she uses it against me. Well, what do I do about it? - Oh, well, it's quite simple. Um, if you want to contest the claim, then you go to court. If not, tear it up. - If I don't go to court? - Well, then the court will almost certainly make an order giving the applicant custody of the child, provided she's a suitable person. - She's living in adultery with her bloody SP bookie. - Well, I can't really express an opinion here, Mr. Macauley. But, well, even in circumstances like that, the court will tend to favor the mother. - Well, they can't just go ahead if I'm not there. - [Bathgate] Yes, they can. - What, with the kid in hospital, touch and go whether she lives? They'll still go ahead without me? - Yep. (dramatic music) - Mack? It's all over the district. I'm so sorry. - She's not too good. - God. - I'm not gonna be there. - Well, you've got to. Otherwise you've no chance. - [Mac] What, and leave her here? - There's nothing you can do here either. - [Mac] What if she wakes, wants me, and I'm not here? - [Lily] Mac, she's got to wake first. What can you really do? - I'm her dad. I care more than they do. That's why I've got to be here. - I care. Go, Mac. Telephone anytime, day or night. I won't leave her. (train clattering) - [Mac Voiceover] You're honor, I can't afford a lawyer. So, I've got to talk for myself. She's only a scrap of a kid. (sighs) But she's a fighter. And if she pulls through at the hospital, it's only right you give her a go. - [Woman] Do you mind if I sit here? (train clattering) - [Mac Voiceover] She came as a stranger, and she grew on me. I didn't want her. She wanted me, and I was wrong. - Have you got a light? - [Mac Voiceover] She put the hobbles on me. Had a rope 'round my neck, and she wouldn't let go. I didn't have to be frightened of her gettin' away from me. She was frightened of me getting away from her. - Thank you. - Thank you. (train clattering) (train chugging) - [Mac] I'll admit this. I took her out of spite, and it turned out to be a good thing for both of us. She was growing in sour soil, and I don't want to see her back there. But I don't want to see her in a home either. If you're dead set against giving her to me, then give her to her mother. That's all I can say, Your Honor. (knocking on door) - [Marge] Well? - She's alive, just. (sighs) - Good. Then the court'll give her to me. I told you I'd get her back. - Why'd you give me the chance to go to court? - To see your face when they give her to me. (laughs) - You won't get her. (laughs) No court can make me. God himself couldn't make me. (laughs) I'll be at the Hotel Metropol when you're ready to talk sense. - [Marge] Mm. (laughs) (door unlocking) - You on that again? - No one's gonna hurt ya, Donny. - What's he here for? - Tell him. Tell him why I'm here. - [Marge] Get out! - You said he wouldn't be here. You said it'd be a work-over, just to get your own back, you said! - Child, Donny. To get her child back, for Municipal Councilor, Donny Carol to be father to. - Well, what's he doing here? If this gets in the papers, I'll lose-- - She asked me! She sent me an invite. - You stupid bloody. - What was gonna happen to the kid, Donny? Tell me, or I'll put you through that window, third floor, and we'll find out whether bookies can fly. - I-I-I don't know. Get her adopted, an orphanage, I don't know. - I think she lied to you, Donny. I think she was gonna talk you around, keep the kid. - Okay, that's it. Stone him. - Now, I go to court tomorrow and I talk. - No. - Front page. - Donny, please. - Councilor's love nest. - It's a finish. - I need you! - It's not too late. - Call off the case? - That's up to Marge. - Did you hear? Call it off. It's the kid or me. (somber music) (crying) (birds squawking) - Mac. - It's okay, we got her. - Oh. - How is she? - Well, they've operated 'til her body won't take anymore, and we just have to wait. (sighs) (door opens) (footsteps approach) (somber music) - [Buster] Gooby likes you. - [Lily] Hm. - [Buster] Gooby likes you too, Dad. (car door slams) - [Lily] Gooby's got very broad tastes. - [Mac] You don't have the right! Nobody's got the right to tell me what to do! - [Lily] Mac, you need help. - [Mac] I do not need help. I don't need anybody's help. - [Buster] Dad! Dad! I'll walk along the roads, and on the road, and keep going on the roads, 'cause I know you always walk along the roads, and I'll find ya. (somber music) - [Lily] We're grown ups, Dad. - [Thad] Grown up can be pretty bleak without it. (somber music) (footsteps approach) - She's through. She's awake. She's been asking for somebody, something. Sounds like Gooby. Does that make sense? - Bloody kid's spoiled. Always wanting toys. 'Bout time she grew out of it. (gentle music) (cries) (crying) Now, what'd I tell you about motorcars? - [Buster] Gooby's getting better now, Daddy? (gentle music) - Yes, love. Gooby's getting better. (gentle music)
