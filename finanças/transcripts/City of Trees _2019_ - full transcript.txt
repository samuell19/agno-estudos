[acoustic guitar and piano music] It's called the City of Trees, but why do I feel like I can't breathe. Don't be so dramatic. High school was fuckin' weird. What's weird about it? I don't know, man. I just feel like You were good. I feel like you're just always good. Years of practice. You know. - You practice at it? - Yeah. - That's what you do? - I don't know. I just feel like I made a decision to just kind of say "fuck it" and just be who I wanted to be. - In high school? - Yeah, I'm kind of a Kind of a cool guy, aren't I? [laughs] Okay you can go now. You want me to leave? Okay, I'll just get out of here. - No, no, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Bye. - Bye! Cheers. I don't know man. I just-- I don't know. I think peaking just wasn't on my graph chart. I feel like my life has always been just kind of a straight line. You know just [makes monotone sound] You've never really changed. Not in a bad way though. In-- yeah, really good way. - Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, not that I'm like giving you a compliment or anything. Thanks, I appreciate that. Now you never, you know. [Teddy laughs] [Ainsley coughs] - Yeah, I feel like yours is - Don't. Is more like Aww... Hey! [fluctuating tone] Aww... Hey! Aww... Like waves in the ocean. I'm like... Maybe like a sound wave of a really, really complex... ...techno song? - You're an asshole. - That's me! Or like heartbeat. Or something like more rhythm to it. - One with a murmur though. You're such a dick. I guess no one knew me in high school. Unless people that, I mean, I don't know. There were some that really knew me. - Yeah. - There's you. Yeah, there's me. You know the ones you know. You know? - You know. Do you think that's why you didn't get invited to the 10-year reunion? Why would I care though? It's-- Don't burn yourself. - I don't want to burn myself. The popular ones are just married and have four kids or gross. The weirdos are making it happen in life. The fuck do I care? - Yeah. Yeah! Fuck you, Ryan Langly! [Teddy laughs] - Fuck you, Donna Hughes! - Yeah! The fuck kind of name is 'Donna Hughes' anyway? Don-na Huuughes! Fuck you, Derrick Mallock! That's too many consonants in a name. Der-rick Mal-lock. Shut up! - Fuck you, Sophie Michaels! - Ooh-- She's actually still pretty hot. And kinda nice, actually. How? How is that fair How the fuck is that fair? [Mom] Do I smell smoke? [Ainsley/Teddy] Uh-uh We're not smoking. Who's that? - [quietly] She's never going - Hi, Mrs. Sadler. - It's Teddy. - Oh, hi Teddy. - Hey. Goodnight mom. Listen, you need to go to bed really soon because we got to get to the grocery store really early tomorrow. Why? Because they're having a sale on turkeys. - Okay. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I don't know why we're so afraid of you mom. [laughs] How old are we again? Ugh. - Old enough. Yeah. I just can't believe you make it back here every year for this. Nostalgia, man. Gets me every time. - You make it back for Easter. - I love Easter. - Who says that? [knocks on door] I better not see anyone I know here. It was your decision to come out in pajamas, not mine. Do you know what time it is? So when did you decide that hair color? I'm going to get the cranberry sauce. We need eight cans. Hey, it's Sophie! Look who it is. Sophie. Hey Sophie! Hi! Oh hey, Mrs. Sadler. Hi. Look who's home. It's her first holiday home in seven years. [Mom laughs] Ainsley. I know who you are. We went to school together for like 12 years. Uh, are you here for the 10-year reunion? No, I actually wasn't invited to that. Oh, well this is awkward. [awkward laughs] Yeah. I'm just here for holidays and stuff. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. Are you gonna be around for the sweater party Friday night? I Wouldn't miss it. [chuckles] It's supposed to be freezing tomorrow night, so I'll see you then too. - Okay. That's great. Thank you. [man] Number 8. Gotta go, called my number. - Bye. - Bye. How do you know Sophie? She comes over to cover the plants when it gets cold. She's a nice girl. - What's our number? - 39. Oh my god, mom. Hey, what's the rush? Hold on. Okay. Gotta get dad some soda. You know how he like his soda. Pineapple crush. Ooh! He'd love that. [Mom sighs] Let's see. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Get some of that.

It seems like it kind of requires a lot. Not really. Like what? Ugh. Checking the weather? [chuckling] I do that most days anyway. You're not used to the cold weather anymore, huh? Not really. You know, last year when I was out here covering everything real snowflakes started falling. I've never seen that before. Real life ones? As opposed to the fake ones? I'd only seen the paper ones we used to cut out in school. It's crazy. You think you know a place so well, but it still surprises you. That is crazy. Surprising is definitely the last word I'd use for this place. It's kind of the beauty of it, though. I'd say it's more the anxiety-inducing part. Thank you for helping.

He'd love to see you in it. How long has Sophie been helping you? She just helps with the plants. Um, I don't know like Four winters? -Why? -Because my carpal tunnel. When it's frozen, it hurts worse. -Do you pay her? -No, I don't. She works all over town in those community gardens. -She does? -Yeah. You know, when I tell her about your big fancy job, she's very impressed with you. -Mom... Stop. -[Mom chuckles] Whenever I talk about your big fancy job ears just seem to perk up. I even made my doctor subscribe. [Ainsley takes a deep breath] I just don't understand why they don't put your pictures in the magazine. You're more talented than all those stuffy photographers. That's not how it works, mom. You have to get it approved by a lot of people before you can get printed. What time's Kelley get here? Uh, she's going to get here at about 9 o'clock. Oh god, I gotta prepare. She's going to show up with the whole neighborhood like she always does. Da da daaa. Pumpkin pie! -I'm not hungry, dad. -Oh come on, come on. You're gonna love this. I already got it started. I'm really not hungry. -[Dad] One little bite. -[Mom] Take a bite. Come on, my poopy face. This is your holiday pie. -Just a little bite. -That's big bite. -[Dad] Mmhmm. -[Ainsley] Mmm. Okay, that's what I wanted. That's a smile. That's Sher's sweater, huh? You're gonna where that? That is so sweet of you. Okay, alright. More pie, more pie. [rhythmic humming] [sniffs] [Mom] Close the door. [door slams] [Mom kisses] [timer goes off] Oh boy, the pot roast. -You need help? -Nope.

In a little while. [party chatter] [party guests chatting in the background] [party guests laughing] [Dad] Where's your train of thought though? [Mom] Oh boy... Let's get serious here. A toast to-- [Dad] You worked on this. For a week, yeah. A toast. To togetherness. [Dad] Yeah. And to my beautiful, baby daughter, Ainsley for being home. And to her job for allowing it. I love being left out of the speech. [Mom] And to my other beautiful daughter Kelley and her love of many things. -[Dad] Here here, Kelley. -There you go. [Mom] And to new recipes with glazed carrots this year. I hope you all like them. You can um-- -[Dad] It's so good. [Mom] I have brussel sprouts too. I roast them with cloves of garlic. A toast to cloves of garlic. Wait a minute. [Dad] Garlic? You're toasting to garlic? [Mom] Yes! I am toasting garlic. You're not writing a novel. Let's just toast. Please, we're hungry. [Mom] Come on now, I wasn't finished yet. [Dad] I thought you were winding down. [Mom] No, we have more people to thank. [Dad] Ah gee. Alright, okay. Thank everybody that's here and let's eat. Please. Alright, and everybody that's not here. So... -[multiple] Cheers! -[Dad] Bravo. Hey. [laughs subtly] [exhales] [quietly] Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. You look ridiculous. [bottle opens and cap drops] You feel Okay? Yeah. No we'll go soon. We'll go soon. It was fun. It was a lot of fun. I'll be home in few. I'm gonna leave really soon. Try to fall alseep. Okay, love you too. Bye. -Hey. -Hey. Thanks. Trying to outlast everyone? Food coma. Right, me too. What? What? No, nothing. It's weird that you're at my house. It's weird, right? [laughs] No. I'm at your house more than you're at your house. I hope they have Uber here. This town's not too small? No, you just call your friends. They're not conditional, you know? Not like the one's in the big cities. Ouch. What do you know about big cities? I lived in New York for six months. Six months? Yeah, it wasn't for me. [laughter] Which part? Ugh, all of it. I see your work. Your magazine? -Mmm. Your mom always buys me a copy when it comes out. It's really cool stuff. Thanks. You work with--trees now? Oh you make it sound sooo glamorous. [laughter] Yeah, I guess I hated the city that much it actually pushed me into it. No, I'm kidding. Um, remember Mr. Lawson's class? That guy was so nuts. -NUTS! Nuts. But-- as I get older, I don't know he makes more sense to me. He used to have this saying on his wall "The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, the second best time is today." I think maybe I took it too literal. Why do you cover her flowers? Why not? There has to be a reason. Why? Do you believe that? That there's a reason for everything? Most things, yeah. You're probably not going to remember this, but she gave me a ride when I was maybe twelve? And it was like below freezing out and I was waiting for the bus. I do remember that. I got so embarrassed for her stopping. I really thought she wanted to embarrass me. Honestly. I was so mad. It's funny how people feel different things from the same situation. Yeah. I should head home. Yeah. Yeah. You have one of those unconditional friends You have one of those unconditional friends to pick you up, huh? [laughs] No. I'm gonna walk. I like walking. I can walk you. No, you don't have to. -I'm not tired. I'm really not. Well then who's gonna walk you home? That's a good question. [laughter] Is it more dangerous around here than I remember? Well-- we did have a gang try to form once like four years ago. But they quit. They quit? You can't quit! I thought you have to kill each other or something. Yeah, I don't know. [laughter] [laughter] [sighs] [footsteps walking] I forgot how cold it is here. And I survived a winter in New York City. What are you trying to say? I mean, I never knew you that well, but I never took you for a complainer. -That's probably why you left. -Probably. Yeah. I heard about your dad. I read about it online. I'm really sorry. Yeah, thanks. We weren't super close when he passed so... Still. Really sorry. I think it was the unexpected part that threw me off the most. I bet. You know, when I was a kid, I rode up this curb too fast. And that's how I got this scar here. -This curb? -Yep, this one. This very curb. Yeah. Good times. I just remember thinking my mom was going to be so pissed at me. Why? I don't know. Guess I was a worried kid. But no, I borrowed my sister's bike and I kinda scratched up the front. I, uh... convinced her to let me take it 'cause she wanted some sour watermelon gummies from the store. And I told her I'd get some for her. It's the only reason she said yes and I flipped over the handle bars and [laughs] I rode back home. Freaked out. I hid by the trash cans. And yeah, I didn't go back in. 'Cause I just thought they'd be more worried than mad at me. And what happened when you went inside? Well, I mean, I got hungry waiting outside so I ate the gummies. And then they were pissed. They were so pissed. [laughs] You messed up her bike and you ate her gummies. Yeah, I mean I wasn't that smart as a kid so... -Yes you were. -No, I really wasn't. Guess I was just open to learning. This is me here. Thanks for walking me home. -Yeah, of course. Bye. -Goodnight. [sniffs] [chilly exhale] Ok Well, long story short: I'd been with them for 27 years and I had a loss in the family and they, they let me go. No sir, it wasn't. No, but... Well, I missed a week or two. Maybe two weeks. But you can be sure that won't happen again. You can be assurred. Um sure, yeah, you can call them. Yeah, sure. Of course. Do your due diligence and all. Um, when can I expect to hear from you again? Oh. Okay. Well Alright, well Thanks for considering me anyway. Yeah, you have a good holiday too. Okay I appreciate it, yeah. [Sophie] Hey. Potatoes. Celery. Small towns are weird. Hey, you wanna get a coffee? At 4pm? Yeah. Okay. Ugh, okay. This coffee's really bad. Is it? It tastes like mud. Do you not taste that? I don't really drink coffee. I don't have a palette for what's good and bad, yeah? Then why'd you say yes to having a coffee? I was cold. -[both laugh] It's warming me up. I can almost feel my fingers again. So we're getting better. ['Silent Night' plays on radio] Oh I love this song. [music gets louder] I should probably get going.

It's not just a job. That's what anyone in this town brings up--is my job. You know, no one approached you in high school because it was like you had everything figured out. It was because you were intimidating. That's not true. Ha. I don't know. People ask you your job right off the bat so they can calculate how much respect to give you. Mmm-- -Yeah? No?

What does it say you want to be when you grow up? A dog. Let's not talk about it. [whispers] A dog? A boy made fun of me, he said it was stupid and it wasn't a real dream and I cried.
