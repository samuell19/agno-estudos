Fantastic! Fantastic! If you create any more like this, you'll put the human race out of business. Don't be so magnanimous, Jerry. You know that heat sensing detector was your idea. Oh, now... stop tearing yourself down, you were about to discover that yourself. All the same, it was your idea, and as you can see, it's the key to the whole... May I? - Congratulations, darling! - Hey Mom, turn off that light! Not now, Billy, this is much too important. Your father has just became a famous man. What do you mean? International Peace Prize awarded to Jeremy Spensser. Dr. Jeremy Spensser, 34, son of the distinguished brain surgeon and anatomist, today received one of the worlds greatest honors for his contributions toward word peace. I want to see the movie. Oh, yeah, sure. Come on, I'll show you how to reverse the machine. As head of the World Food Organization, Mr. Spensser's work with frost-resisting plants promises to create, out of frozen polar regions of the globe, a new breadbasket for the world. Spensser, remarkable for his versatility in this age of specialization, has contributed significantly toward flood control, toward the isolation of element 106, and with his brother Henry, achieved a significant new development in automation. It's all sort of, ah premature, isn't it? I mean, an award for peace, with peace still so very far away. - Will it ever come any closer? - Oh, yes, yes. I think he can. If the people of the world get enough to eat, war might just become obsolete. And that's what you're going to work towards. As soon as we come back from Stockholm. Stockholm? Oh, now, honey, do we have... do we really have to go? I have already wired your acceptance. You know, she always Dad! I want to see the machine that works like a man. Oh, yeah! Peace Prize Winner Returns Attention! Flight number 37, now arriving from Stockholm and London. Landing on the west landing strip. Passengers should clear customs within the hour. Thank you. I repeat. Flight number 37, now arriving from Stockholm and London. Passengers should clear customs within the hour. Thank you. Dr. Spensser, you must be very proud of your son's achievements. I am, I am. Of course his present achievements are nothing to his future. Don't you agree, John? Oh, I beg your pardon. This is Professor Carrington. He's Jeremy's oldest and dearest friend. Well, I believe he's one of the few authentic geniuses in this country. - Don't you agree, Henry? - That's what I've always been told. Of course, you know Jeremy's brother Henry. Brilliant man too, in electronics. Dr. Spensser, I understand you're one of our foremost brain surgeons. Tell me, does the brain of a genius look any different from the common garden variety type brain, say, such as mine? Afraid not. You mean to tell me there's no difference in size or shape? No, none that we've been able to ascertain. The question of genius has fascinated scientists for centuries, but many genius brains have been minutely examined and as far as appearances are concerned, they're physically identical to any other brain. Of course, there are variations mind you, to the use that genius is put. How do you mean, Doctor? Well, for example, you take men like Machiavelli, like Napoleon. They used their genius for purely selfish purposes. They used them to promote their own needs and their own desires. And I'm very sorry to say, that most people are in that first, primitive level. Then of course there's the second level, that of the people who work to satisfy the needs of their own families and their community. And then the third and highest level where they work to satisfy the needs of all humanity. And I must say my son Jeremy is in that third class if you'll forgive a doting father. Look, there's Grandpa! - Looks like a welcoming committee. - The price you have to pay for fame. Hi, how are you? Oh, fine. John, good to see you. - Marvelous! Did we keep you waiting long? - No... Yes, you did. Oh, boy! Get my plane! Oh, the wind's got his plane. I'll get it, Billy. Jeremy. Call an ambulance. I'm afraid it's too late, sir. I said call an ambulance! The ambulance is on the way, sir. I don't understand. Neither do I. Oh, Doctor Spensser, I... I need no one. He was dead within five seconds. Then, what's all this about an operation? What can he do? I have no idea. John... it's been so long. Don't you think that maybe... Ann, please, no, don't, don't hope for anything. I did... I did all I could. A great man. A great scientist. One of those geniuses who enlarged the horizons of human knowledge. A man still young, his greatest works still before him. We are tempted to think that his was a tragically foolish and wasteful death. This freakish accident seemingly so meaningless. And yet we must believe that in his infinite wisdom there is a profound meaning in the loss of... No! No! And you can find a profound meaning out of such a shocking and stupid accident! Look... the brain of a genius has been obliterated because of one fragile bone in the fabric his body. You can find a meaning to that? Doctor, there must be something... Look, I'll give you a meaning, and I'll give you an ugly one. In these desperate times of world crisis, we have been deprived of true genius! I agree, but always in critical times, nature seems to provide us with several men of genius. Nature? What errant drivel. Don't you realize that Jeremy's brain was unique? That it was like Darwin's, like Michelangelo, like Da Vinci, like Einstein. Now, suppose all those great brains had been allowed to continue their work unhampered by their body. Think of the advance in civilization. No, no. No, I believe that every man, that includes every great man, is the product of his mind and body. It's through the divine spark of the Creator that the interconnection of body and mind is achieved through the soul. Oh, now don't speak to me of antiquated notions like a soul. You-you're a scientist. Can you measure a soul? Can you measure it? Huh? As a scientist, I believe that any brain, unable to feel hunger and cold, pleasure and pain, love and hate, divorced from human experience must become dehumanized to the point of monstrousness. You are an idiot, an idiot. I tell you, that in the brain, and in the brain alone, lies the glory of man. The ability to think, to create, and these... why, these go on eternally. I tell you that the brain is supreme, it is immortal and I can prove... - You...! - Wait. Wait... this is merely a theoretical discussion. Oh, yes. Quite. Quite theoretical. He's taking it very badly, isn't he? I'm worried about him. He's going to need you, Henry. That'll be something new. He's always needed Jeremy before. He preferred Jeremy... - loved... - Well, that's all in the past. Right now, your father needs you. Do you think that you might be able to stay on here with him for a while? I don't see why not. Wonderful girl, Anne. She's going to have a bad time of it too. I'll do my best to help her too. Lonnie... Jerry... Uncle Butch... Billy? Billy! I've got something for you. Billy, you should answer when you're spoken to. Billy, want to look in my pockets and see what I found for you? No, you're pretty cold. Ah, that's even colder. Now you're warm. There! Got it! Thank you, Uncle Henry. Very nice! Want me to show you how it works? Not tonight. It's time for bed, darling. Go on. Don't forget to come up and tell me a story, Mommy. All right. I'm sorry about Billy, Henry. He's been a little bit difficult since... Of course. I wish I could captivate him as easily as he has me. I'm devoted to him you know, and to you. Your martini, two olives and an onion, right? Exactly right. To you, Anne... - and to... - Your father. I'm worried about him, Henry. He isn't joining us for dinner again. Oh, he's always like this when he starts a new project. He's isolated himself in that laboratory. Sixteen hours a day, and more sometimes. Good therapy for him. But what does he do in there? He's forbidden me to go anywhere near the laboratory. Why? Is it dangerous work? Hmm, he hasn't confided in me either. I wish you could persuade him to get away for a while. I can't even persuade you to do that. Anne, do you realize you haven't been out of this house in over 4 months? That's unhealthy too. Please, Henry. Let's drive in to New York tonight, have dinner, go to the theater. You really should, you know. If you like. I do. Come... Let's go, before you change your mind. Henry. Yes, Father? Would you come with me, please? We'll have another evening. Soon. What is it, Father? You'll soon see. There. I don't understand. Do you know what that is? A human brain. Brilliant. And this? - An Electroencephalograph. - And what does such a machine do? It records the electrical wavelengths of the brain. Brilliant. What do you see? Delta wavelengths. The rhythm of a sleeping brain. You infer then that the brain is asleep? - Yes. - And if the brain is asleep, could you logically infer that it could awaken? Of course. Good. Attention! Assuming a meson to have a vertical velocity of 54 mps, and a horizontal velocity of 24, state the magnitude and the direction of the resultant velocity. - Could you give me an answer to that? - With a little time. Don't trouble... The answer is 59.1 66 degrees. Take a look at the graph again. Alpha waves. Exactly. Alpha waves. The rhythm of active thought process. Would you kindly read what is reported there? 59.1 at 66 degrees. No. No, it's inhuman. Inhuman? It would have been inhuman to deny the world of his genius. Deprive the world of... Dad, Jeremy's dead. He's dead! Jeremy is not dead. Now, you listen to me. When you needed his help, he offered it to you. Now we need your help. My help? Bring Jeremy out of the darkness. With your knowledge of automation, you can help him live again. The brain of a genius operated by a push button. You haven't seen any of this, have you, Anne? What? The night, the moon, garden. I'm sorry. It's still too soon, isn't it? It isn't easy, John. I know. This hasn't been a very gala farewell party for you, has it? Well, I've has a marvelous time with my hostess, but what the devil happened to my hosts? They're both of them working on something very mysterious. Top secret. You make it sound like cloak and dagger stuff. I really believe it is, John. They're isolated themselves in that laboratory, day after day. It's not much fun for you, is it? I don't mind that. Yes, but I do. You know, as soon as I get back, I'm going to see to it that you're kept busy night and day. Whether you like it or not. Yeah, that's better. Well, shall we go look for them, and see if we can get them out of that laboratory at least long enough to say goodbye to you? Come on. Yes? Oh, hello, Anne. I know, dear, and I'm sorry. Will you hurry! No, I'm afraid that's impossible now, but please tell Carrington... Anne, dear, please don't be angry. Well? Ready? Ready. You have to push the lever to the left. I placed the control where he can't possibly reach it. Whatever for? So he won't be able to destroy himself. Why would he? Why shouldn't he? Jeremy, you can see. Jeremy? Do you understand? You're all right. You can see. You hear and you can move. Do you understand? You've been ill. You've been very ill. You're going to be well again. Jeremy? Do you understand? You're all right! You can hear and you can move. You can see you can hear and you can move. Do you understand? - Answer me! - [ Unintelligible ] Move, hear, hear. Move, hear, hear. Move, hear. [ Unintelligible... ] - Father. Father. - Yes, Jeremy, you see me. Can't move. I can't move. You can move. You hear? - You can walk. - Can't. - Can't... - Walk, Jeremy, now. - ...move. - You can, Jeremy! - You can walk, right now! - Can't!! Now! Henry, turn off the control! No! Anne. Get her away, quickly. Henry! - What was it? That voice! - Now, it's all right, darling. - It's all right, darling. - But what was it? I'll explain... first... come away. Come, darling. So now you know all there is to know. Our experiment today turned out to be a complete failure. When it did, my father lost his temper, violently! But all that shouting and those horrible sounds. Anne, you know the strain he's under these past few months. Yes, but, but those cries, those shouts? They weren't like your father at all. They reminded me so much of Jeremy's voice. Anne, drink this, please. It's my fault you've been so disturbed. Your fault? I've left you alone so much. It's no wonder you've grown morbid. Imagining you hear dead voices. I'm going to change all that now. Now that the experiment's over, I'm going to spend my time looking after you and Billy. As much as you let me. Do you think you can get some sleep now? I'll try. Good. I'd, uh... better get back to the laboratory. They probably need me. They? Who's they? - What? - You said, they need you! No, I-I couldn't have. Well, I'm glad the sedative is responsible for that and not me. Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I really will be able to go to sleep. Good. And Anne, I promise you, no more lonely hours, no more unearthly sensations, and no more voices from the dead. That's all behind us now. Good night. Thank heavens the power hypnosis worked. Fortunately, there's been no brain damage. - You're not going on with this? - Well, of course I am. Father, look here. You recognize these, don't you? Next time that happens, his brain can become permanently deranged. - There will be no next time. - How can you prevent it? That isn't just an abstract intellect, it's a brain, that remembers, and feels, and suffers. You've seen it suffering already. Do you think for one minute that he can continue to exist when he's been deprived of everything he's ever know or loved? His wife, his child, his home? You've got to think of Anne too, Father. If she were ever to find out about this... She won't. She believes Jeremy to be dead, she'll continue to believe it. I won't have anything more to do with this. It's wrong! It's cruel, and it's wrong! It certainly would be wrong to prevent Jeremy from continuing his work. He'll never go on with it. He'll be in such torment that he... Jeremy has always lived beyond personal desire. I know that I can persuade him to continue. What if he refuses? If he refuses, will you destroy him? Will you destroy him, Father?! Yes. Jeremy, do you hear me? I want to help you. Jeremy! Do you understand me? You want to help me? Yes. Then destroy me. All right, if that's what you want. But I don't believe you. Destroy me. Jeremy, believe me, I know the depth of your suffering... the loss of your family and you'll never have a personal life again as a man. But think of the suffering throughout the world. Think of the millions of human beings! Jeremy, you in your pain, you can think. Help them Help them as you did before. Destroy me! That was your life. That was your dedication, are you going to give it up now knowing you can do more for the world than any man has ever given. It was you, wasn't it, of thinking of transforming the polar regions? Stop! Please, stop! Please, stop! Father. Jeremy, you still have a priceless gift to give to the world. Assuming, of course, two conditions. Two conditions? The first is time. Time to complete your experiments. Your brother and I have already given you that. The second condition we are powerless to give you. What is that? The will, the will to continue. That you'll have to provide for yourself. I can give you destruction or you can give us a world of abundance. The choice is yours to make. I'll try, Father. But now, I will impose a condition. What is it? I don't want anyone ever to see me. I'll will conduct all of my experiments in this laboratory with you and Henry. And no one else. All right. Well, there's no perceptible change. Use strains 19 and 38. Nineteen... Thirty-eight. I'm ready, Jeremy. Jeremy? What is it? I keep seeing... Seeing what? Images... meaningless images. One of them keeps recurring, can't seem to erase it. Well, can you describe the image? A ship... at sea. Passenger ship in the fog. Just that. Nothing more. Now I can see its name. S.S. Viking. - What is it? - In the fog... another ship! Crash! It's going to crash! Passengers! Passengers! [ Unintelligible ] Nooo... nooo. I want you to rest, Jeremy. Rest. Why, that's good! What are you working on? See, he's got a beak. Ooh, that's very clever. Let's see. - Hello. - Hello. Billy, want to see what I brought you tonight? Sure, Uncle Henry. Ah, got it the first try. - What's this stuff? - That's wonderful stuff, Billy. It's all about Hawaii, where I'd like to take you and your mother for a vacation. - Would you like that? - I think so. And would your mom? I don't know. Can you get away? I don't don't see why not. Henry! Henry! Come in here quick! ...of the disaster at sea, 200 miles off the fog bound Atlantic coast last night. Here you see the first films of the collision between the S.S. Viking and the South American freighter. As photographed from our own special camera plane this morning. Here is the freighter making for port under her own power. But with her bow badly damaged. Come on, let's go. [Announcer continues...] Well, there's no doubt about it. None. Do you realize the enormous implications of this? Amusing, isn't it? I cannot smell, or taste, or feel, but it seems I have extrasensory perception. You say that other images have come to you from time to time? Yes. We must investigate this thoroughly. Make a complete report, Henry. What do you find so amusing? Not amusing, ironic. It occurred to me how ironic it is that your grave should lie just a few hundred yards from here. And yet, all this time you continue so brilliantly to exist. Brilliantly! I-I-I-I-I warn you, Henry. These are powerful! You know how powerful, because you made them. Don't goad me. I warn you. Don't! The world's leading experts will convene on Oct 2nd at the U.N. in New York to examine the growing world food shortage. Professor John Robert Carrington, who will preside, promised to read a posthumous report on the development of polar grains by the great Jeremy Spensser. Hah! Good of John to remember me, today of all days. Today? September the 18th? Have you forgotten so soon? The first anniversary of my death. Jeremy! In fact, I think I shall make a pilgrimage. The grave you so thoughtfully provided for me. We've no time for that. Time? I've a lifetime before me. In fact, many lifetimes. I shall take the time... now. I forbid you to do it! You may be seen! Billy, stay close now. Don't go too far, dear. Billy? Billy! Billy, come here. It's all right, Billy. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you, I promise. It's all right. Are you a giant, a real giant? Yes, a real giant. Are you a good giant, or a bad giant? Well... I try to be good, but it isn't easy. Are you a good boy, or a bad boy? I'm like you, I guess. I mean, I try to be good, I mean. What do you giants do? Well, sometimes we like to give boys presents when they're good. Presents? Billy? Billy! Billy! Billy! Billy! Billy! Oh, darling! Darling, are you all right? - Sure I'm all right, Mom. - Did he hurt you? Naw, he didn't hurt me. What-what was it, that monstrous thing? It wasn't a monster, Ma. It was a giant. What? A real live giant, and he was so nice, Mom. Honest, he was the nicest giant you could ever find. The nicest. You lied. You lied to me. You knew they were alive. But you deliberately and maliciously tried to keep my wife and son from me. - No, no, Jeremy, I only wanted... - Shall I tell you've given me? Shall I show you...this, Father? You've given me this body. This flesh that cannot feel. Cannot feel. No! Anne? - Oh. - Anne, I frightened you. I'm sorry. I saw you from my window. You looked so small, so lonely. I haven't been able to get over that...that terrible... What was it, Henry? What was that monstrous thing? I don’t want to speak about it, but believe me, I know. We have to leave. We have to get away from this nightmare. No, I've got to know what it was. Believe me, we've got to get away as soon as possible...tomorrow. - You promised to go to Hawaii with me. - No, I never promised. I need you, and you need me, even though you may not know it now. - Anne. - No, Henry, please. Come in. Anne, I came as quickly as I could. What is it, Anne? It's all right, it's all right, now that you're here. It was terrible. I didn't know what to do, it was so terrible. I'm so glad you're back. Will you help me, won't you? Whatever way I can. You tell me exactly what did happen last night. I did tell you on the telephone. I know it sounds fantastic, but it's true. I don't know what it was, huge, monstrous, eyes blazing, really blazing with light! What do you mean? Was it a man? No. No, it wasn't human! Whatever it was, it wasn't human! You don't believe me, do you? Anne, I wish that... I really wish you'd let Dr. Spensser visit you. No, I won't see him. He's responsible. In that laboratory, all those shouts. I won't see him! I won't see him! All right, all right, just as you like. Nobody believes me. Anne, you know that I'd do anything in this world to help you. But you don't believe me. Then, goodnight, John. - Anne, dear... - Goodbye. Well? She's absolutely convinced that she saw someone. But her-her description is... Well, that hallucination, pure and simple. - Did she speak about Henry? - Only that he ran away. Very nice of you to come, John. I'd like to help. Do you think, maybe, if I stayed on for a few days? No, no, we've put you to enough trouble already. - You sure Anne will be all right? - Yes, quite. I'll let you know if there's any news of Henry. - All right, do that. - Nice of you to come. Will you have dinner in the dining room, sir? No-no, no dinner. Yes, sir. - Spensser here. - Father. Listen carefully. I must get away. I need money, Father. - Get away? I don't understand. - What else can I do? He knows I'm in love with Anne. He'll find me if I don't get away. He'll find me and kill me. How-how can he find you? Don't you understand? He can see me. Wherever I am, he can see me. Yes, I can. Right now, Henry is in a telephone booth on the corner of Broadway and 49th Street. Tell him you will send him the necessary money. No! He is to be at 35th Street and the East River at 11:30 tonight. Tell him! Can you hear me, Father? I must have the money tonight. Do as I say. You will send him the money by messenger. Henry? I will send you the money by messenger. He will meet you at 35th Street and the East River tonight. He will meet you at 35th Street the East River Tonight. Why create food for the maimed, and the useless, and the sick? Why should we work to preserve slum people of the world? Isn't it simpler and wiser to get rid of them instead? Unfortunately, there are so-called, humanitarian scientists, and I am one of them, who tried to keep human trash alive. It will be necessary to get rid of those humanitarians first. You understand? We must eliminate the idealists. And you will help me. First of all, you will deny my existence. Is that clear? You will do as I tell you. To the world outside, I do not exist. Gentlemen, I hope you don't propose such an implausibility as a giant tramp? Dr. Spensser, we're trying to find your son's murderer. We intend to explore every possibility, however implausible. As I say, rumors are widespread in this vicinity, of a, sort of a huge man, that's been seen in and around your estate. There have been various descriptions of him. Even one of a mechanical monster. Oh, really, gentlemen. Mrs. Spensser. Have you seen anything that might corroborate these rumors? Well, I... No. No, I-I haven't. Are you sure? Well, if there are no further questions I hope you'll forgive my impatience. I'm preparing a report for the World Food Congress. Charles will show you to the door. Bye, Mrs. Spensser. Doctor. Sorry to have disturbed you unnecessarily, darling. I won't keep you. I saw it. - Saw what? -The monster. You know I saw it. They told me about you, darling. Hallucination. I think it would be wonderful if you could take that vacation to Hawaii that you planned. You need rest, just rest, dear. Umm... Think it over? Yes, sir. I guess I had better go, it's almost time for Billy to come home. Incidentally... May I suggest that you see Billy as little as possible in the next few days? Perhaps, only at bedtime. Hmm? All right! Billy, come here. - I was afraid I'd be late today. - I'd have waited. Did you bring me anything? I wonder. See if I can find it. You have to say if I'm hot or cold. It's all right. Don't do that! Huh? I said...don't do that ever again. Okay, Mister Giant. I'm sorry, Billy but you see it could be dangerous. If you touched me there, I might fall down and not get up again ever. You mean, like you were dead? Yes. That's terrible...I mean, for somebody to die. I don't want you to be dead, or me, or my mom...ever, ever. Don't think about it, Billy. Now! There's your present. Good night, darling. Sleep tight. But without the toys. Good night, Mother. You used to have a toy just like this, Billy. Did I, Mom? Yes, don't you remember? You lost it at the air... Where'd you get this toy, Billy? Mister Giant gave it to me. What?! Remember Mister Giant? You saw him in the forest. Remember how he scared you? You were... seeing him again? Oh, sure, we play together most every day. I love Mister Giant. He's keen. Is he? you know, he was so funny today He asked me not to call him Mister Giant anymore. He wants me to call him Daddy. You will therefore attend the United Nations Congress tomorrow night. And you will bring with you, my wife and son. Now, once more... at eight thirty, exactly, I want you to be at the United Nations building with my wife and son. Your wife and son. We'll be late. Anne, will you...?! There she is now. You're looking very beautiful. Thank you. I still don't understand why Billy has to go. We must be there promptly at 8:30. Eight thirty, exactly. - Professor Carrington? - Ah, yes. As we understand it, you're presiding tonight to honor the late Dr. Jeremy Spensser? Yes, that's right. Come on, - Billy! - Billy, come on! Grandpa, make him stop! I will! I will! I will! Billy! Billy! Mister Gia... Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I hate you! I hate you! No, Billy. You're bad! You're bad! You hurt people, and I hate you! I hate you! Billy, listen. Please listen to me. Billy, I don't think I can stop myself Not anymore. But you can make me stop me, Billy. Billy, I want you to stop me. Harder, Billy! Push harder, please! Harder, Billy. Push harder! Let me go! Well, you were right, Carrington. Without a soul, there's nothing but monsterousness. I only wish that heaven and... Jeremy could forgive me for what I did.
