There was us three and Dad. And Mum, of course. - My mother, she was always the person who kept the calm between Dad and us. Very strong, very loyal. - The Beatles have just arrived for the first time in our country. - When the Beatles came on the scene, it was like, "That's what we've been trying to do." - They turned pop music into an art form, and they were singing three-part harmony like we did. - So we made up our own minds that we were going back to be part of the British Invasion. - Making music was what we wanted to do for the rest of our lives, so we thought, you know, whatever's going to happen, we'll make happen. - ♪ Where is the sun ♪ Before we left Australia, we did an album called "Spicks and Specks," and they became our best demos. ♪ The sun in my life ♪ ♪ It is dead ♪ Dad and I did the rounds, met with industry people, and as we sat in everyone's office, they would say the same thing: "No, no, I'm sorry, lads. We can't help you." - My dad, he was very, you know, "We gotta do this." Because my dad was really the most ambitious man, I think, in the Gibb clan. - We loved the Beatles, so Dad had sent this stuff to NEMS, the Brian Epstein offices. - Brian Epstein, the man who built the Beatles into a cult, is now as well-known as they are. - I was doing Brian's mail most of the time. There was a letter by the father of these three handsome, cute guys who were very proactive and who'd had some success. They came from Manchester, but they were writing from Australia. I showed it to him. Brian said, "Yeah, yeah. That's very nice. No, nice." He said, "Well, give it to Robert." "He's Australian and he's good at these kind of things." - Somebody sent you a tape of these boys from Australia? - Yes, they did. - Oh. - I heard it, and I was absolutely astounded.

He was almost like a parent. - You can't deny talent, and the talent was so obvious. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ ♪ - Somebody mentioned that the Bee Gees were in town. They were good friends of mine from Australia. So I phoned them up. I said, "Is Maurice there, then? Put Maurice on." He said, "We've being signed up "by this guy called Robert Stigwood. "We're doing this recording. Why don't you come and play guitar?" Caught a train into London and found IBC Studios. So there they were. There were Barry, Robin, and Maurice and the drummer, Colin Petersen. That night, my life changed completely. Completely. - The first evening we were in there, there was a blackout. So while we were waiting for the power to come back on, we just sat on the steps, and Barry was playing his guitar. It was so echoey. I mean, it was a wonderful echo in this place. - There we were in the dark.

The thrill was that it did the same thing in America. We thought that we might get a hit in England, but we never dreamed that we might get a hit in England and America as well. ♪ ♪ - So I came over to the United States to make a record deal for them. I made a decision to place the group with Atlantic. - ♪ What you want ♪ ♪ Honey, you got it ♪ - He said, "I'm taking you to meet Ahmet Ertegun and to get you into the American music scene." Otis Redding was playing at the Apollo. Ahmet Ertegun and Robert Stigwood took me down there to see Otis. - ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪ - And it was amazing. - Soul has always had a special place in the Bee Gees' music. - We've always been influenced by Black music. Smokey Robinson, Motown, all that was a big influence on us. - Robert introduced us. He said, "I want you to write a song for Otis Redding."

Those lyrics, "There's a certain kind of light that never shone on me," like, I don't even know if he's talking about himself, but there was some point where I got obsessed, like, tracking down every cover version, like Nina Simone, the Animals. Some great singers have sung that song, obviously, but his vocal, when he sings it, I can still get chills thinking about it. - ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ You don't know what it's like ♪ ♪ Baby, you don't know what it's like ♪ ♪ To love somebody ♪ ♪ To love somebody ♪ ♪ The way I love you ♪ - ♪ Aw, no, no ♪ - ♪ You don't know ♪ - ♪ What it's like ♪ - I just remember this music being on, and I'm like, "Who's this?"

Those early records sound like the Beatles' early records. - ♪ I received an invitation ♪ - It's classic '60s guitar pop sound, but then it had another thing going on. - ♪ "Come to the United Nations" ♪ - You've got the brothers singing, and when you've got brothers singing, it's like an instrument that nobody else can buy. - ♪ That was when I was somebody ♪ ♪ In my own time ♪ - You can't go buy that sound in a shop. You can buy a Fender Stratocaster and put it through a VOX amp and sound like Buddy Holly. You can't sing like the Bee Gees, because when you've got family members singing together, it's unique. - It's the blend of the tones of each brother. And Robin had this wonderful, tear-jerking voice. - Robin was a joyous kid. Hysterically funny. He took great joy in being on television. This was the funniest kid you could ever meet. - My father always used to call him the nanny goat. 'Cause Robin would go... He'd be rehearsing in the back of the car, you know, doing all these phases and, you know... ♪ I love you-ooh ♪ And he'd go, "Shut up! You sound like a bloody nanny goat." ♪ ♪ - ♪ I started a joke ♪ ♪ Which started the whole world crying ♪ - Robin was always a bit of a loner. - I like being spontaneous. I like being funny with people, but you won't get that right away with me, you see. - Robin had a wit that no one could compete with. And he could be very dark too. - ♪ I looked at the skies ♪ - Robin is not a person who would say, "Oh, I love my brothers," or, "Group hug." You know, none of that stuff. - I'm basically a very shy person. I'm very hard to get to know. I have to really know somebody before I reveal myself. ♪ Till I finally died ♪ ♪ Which started the whole world living ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ - You know, I mean, that's the voice. That's the voice that reaches your heart. ♪ ♪ - We did a show at the Saville Theatre, and Paul McCartney was there with Jane Asher, because Robert had said, "Would you come and see the boys?" - When you think that five months before all this was going on, I was in Pitt Street buying up the Beatle fan club book, and now here I am partying with these guys. We felt like we'd arrived. Now I'm living out in Highgate outside London. Barry's got a place in Eaton Square. Robin's got a house in St. George's Hill, beautiful area. - And Mum and Dad had their own place, and, of course, Andy lived with them. He was just like us, and he was always tagging along, hoping that one day, he would do this too. He would like to sing. - There was a lot of hits in that short time, you know, and after all the work we had done through clubs and everything, I felt grown up, you know, so we made the most of it. - Very talented group of men, the Bee Gees. - Once again, the fabulous Bee Gees. - Here they are, and get involved with the Bee Gees.

"Massachusetts" is probably the first song, I think, that really resonates. There is a gospel quality to it. There is a folk quality to it. I didn't know where the hell Massachusetts was, but I found myself singing that and translating it to where I was from. - Robert runs up and he goes, "'Massachusetts' has just gone to number one." We went, "What?" To have a number one in England, you have no idea how much we dreamed of this back in Australia. - ♪ And Massachusetts ♪ ♪ Is one place I have seen ♪ ♪ ♪ - "Massachusetts" from the Bee Gees. - I met the Bee Gees at "Top of the Pops." I was young. Was I 16? Maybe I was even 17. - Top pop girl in America, top pop girl in Britain, the one and only Lulu. - ♪ Some people live within the world ♪ ♪ And some people live without it ♪ ♪ Some people gotta whisper their love ♪ ♪ And some, they gotta shout it ♪ The Bee Gees were always in the studio. They were always recording. They would literally go into the studio and start writing. I had never known anything like that before. - We don't usually write our lyrics till the day we sing them. We usually write our lyrics in the studio itself. That seems to work through thick and thin. It always works for us. - It's very hard to describe how we write, but the only way I can describe how we work at it is by becoming one mind. - Maurice had unique insight into the way Robin and I thought. He would just be fiddling around on the piano. He'd suddenly play something, and, "What was that?" He was trying to please us and the way that we would all try to please each other, and that sometimes was the birth of a song. - All of a sudden, we'll wake each other's little instincts up and the melodies come. It's wonderful when you hear it taking shape. Then it all blossoms. - The third verse is four bars. - It's rolling. - They'd say, "Okay, we're ready to roll," right? And they'd play the song, and I'd work the chords out. Colin would figure out what he's gonna do on the drums. They'd say, "Right, here we go. Let's go. Bang, bang, bang." Down it went. And that spontaneity came out in the songs. - In those days, you knocked an album out in three weeks. I think we had three albums out in one year. ♪ But that was when I got an idea ♪ ♪ Came like a gun and shot in my ear ♪ - ♪ Don't you think it's time you got up ♪ ♪ And stood alone? ♪ ♪ ♪ - When we went to Europe, there'd always be a big bunch of kids outside waiting for us to arrive. It was a frightening time, because they crawled all over the Mercedes. They were on the roof. They were at the window. It was crazy. "Hey, guys. Do you think we're famous? Could be." - The Bee Gees, the most exciting sound in the world. - ♪ Now ♪ ♪ I found ♪ ♪ That the world ♪ ♪ Is round ♪ - If you've never been famous, the first time it happens, it's a very difficult thing to handle. You don't know how to behave. You don't know how to experience it. And that affected all of us in its own way. - I had six Rolls-Royces before I was 21. I don't know where they are now. But I mean, that's how crazy it was. - We were all very selfish at that point. The testosterone kicked in, and the competition of life began. ♪ I told him I'm in no hurry ♪ ♪ But if I broke her heart ♪ ♪ Then won't you tell her I'm sorry? ♪ - There was always a conflict between Barry and Robin 'cause they both had fantastic voices and Robin wanted to sing the song and Barry wanted to sing it. ♪ I've just gotta get a message to you ♪ ♪ Hold on ♪ ♪ Hold on ♪ - Both of us wanted to be individual performers. We all wanted individual recognition. And therein lies the issue. ♪ Hold on ♪ - I'm speaking to you from a club in Hamburg, and I'm Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees. Robin here. Robin, we've heard rumors that the group is splitting up. Would you like to verify those rumors? - If I was to say that was true, then I would be the premier of Russia. - I don't know. - Thank you very much, Mr. Petersen. How about you, Mr. Melouney? - Oh, no. I don't think it is. - No. No. No. - I always say that making music with your family is equally the greatest strength and the greatest weakness you could ever have in a musical partnership. To get to the top or near the top, you've gotta be incredibly driven, and what drives you is your ego. And when you get there and everybody's got an ego about it, it can be tricky to stay there. - ♪ I am the searcher ♪ ♪ Of my fortunes ♪ ♪ I got my right hand ♪ ♪ On the wheel ♪ - The three of us stopped looking inwards to each other and all started looking outwards to what we could be individually. "To hell with what my brothers think." And each one of us was thinking that. ♪ Don't wanna live ♪ ♪ Inside myself ♪ - To travel the world when you're young with a family member gives you a certain sense of who you are and where you've come from and all that. So you kind of walk that tightrope. - We'd been together all our lives, don't forget. - We'd been together since Robin and I were five, singing professionally. You know, it's a lot of years. - We'd been kids living together with each other right up until the time we arrived and even after we arrived in England. - ♪ Don't wanna live inside myself ♪ Robin was first to say, "Well, I'm quitting the group." I stopped really knowing Robin and his personal life once we became famous. And the same with Mo. Our three lives were three different lives. We were no longer living the same life. ♪ ♪ - Brothers... in general, it's a very complicated thing, you know? Emotions are heightened, and there's things that go back to childhood about, you know, if one kid got more attention than the other, and all these things play out in front of just a small group of friends, but when you magnify that with the whole world, it changes the game a little bit. - Robin, that's a good picture. That's you, Barry, Colin, Vince. - That's correct, yes. - Do you miss 'em? - Well, it's not really a matter of missing them, really. But I still see them on and off, you know, so that's the way things go. I'll show you the studio anyway. - It was really me and Robin that were in conflict, and I think Maurice was in the middle. - Story of my life, really. Barry would call me up and say, "Well, can you call Robin and tell him if he wants to do this?" And Robin would go, "Well, give Barry a call and let him know that I'm gonna be over." I said, "Robin, you call Barry." "Barry, you call Robin." And they both said, "No, we won't." And for 18 months, they never did. - We had this fascination with calling the newspapers up. You called "NME" or you called "Disc" or "Music Echo" and you'd say... "Robin said this about me, and I just wanna be able to correct the record," and all that stuff. - It was a whole strange episode of our lives, but a lot of things had gone down at that time, and we needed time apart to think about them. - At Caxton Hall, VIP transport for very important pop star Barry Gibb. He's getting married to 20-year-old former Miss Edinburgh Linda Gray. - Their world was crazy at that time. You know, at one time, there was three brothers, and then all of a sudden, it was three wives. - Maurice Gibb and Lulu became Mr. and Mrs. At St. James' Parish Church at Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire. - You think, by marrying someone that you absolutely adore, you think it's gonna solve all your problems, but really... - At Caxton Hall, Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees marries Molly Hullis. - Molly was my first real love. The first serious one. But it was a very traumatic time for me. I went with my manager. He said, "Look, Robin, I'm gonna send you to New Zealand." He says, "You're doing the Redwood Park Festival." So I went there, and of course, it was advertised that the Bee Gees were coming, not just Robin Gibb, you see. All right. Okay. - How'd you feel last night? - I have an obligation to my audience not to look scared, and... I can't say I really felt scared. I was terrified. ♪ How far am I able to ♪ - All three of us became isolated, and all three of us did things to each other that I think we're all sorry for. We loved each other. There was an enormous amount of love between us. Growing up, we did everything together. - We often thought we were triplets. Because we all had the same love. We had the same sense of humor. We had the same love of the same kind of music. - Just typical kids, you know? But the one thing that no one else was doing was that we were singing in harmony, and beyond anything else, that's all we cared about. ♪ ♪ We fell in love with the Mills Brothers. They all did something unique in their own way. And at the same time, Robin and I did two different leads, and Maurice would always know where to put that other melody to make a three-part harmony. They mirrored what we wanted to be. - Do you find you miss Robin and Maurice musically? - Yeah. Not musically. I miss them both as brothers. - Something about entering the world from the same place, I think, has an effect on your ability to sing together, your creative awareness, and your artistic voice. - Could we see the Bee Gees back together again? - That's a very strong point that it could be. I can't say definitely, but I'd like to see the Bee Gees again. - Mr. Epstein has been unwell now for some months. And he's been in the habit of taking tablets to help him sleep at night. He was found in his second-floor bedroom just after 2:00 this afternoon by his housekeeper. - When Brian died and we restructured NEMS, Robert asked to become a more important senior executive for the Beatles, and that wasn't acceptable to them, so he then left the company and took with him Eric Clapton and Bee Gees so he could start off on his own. - We were an asset. We were one of those people Robert needed as an element of going public. It was at the launching of the company where we started to communicate again. And once we came back together again, we wrote "Lonely Days," which reflected the idea that we'd been broken up. - We'd always been boys going up together, and I think we came back together as men. We respected each other's opinions, which we didn't before that. If anything, that was the good thing about the breakup. ♪ I can think of younger days ♪ - I had already started a first verse and chorus. I knew what "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?" was, but then Robin walks in. I said, "I'm just working on this song. Do you wanna do it with me?" And he went, "Yeah, of course." - ♪ I could never see tomorrow ♪ - We'd been apart for two years. If we hadn't been brothers, we wouldn't have lasted half an hour.

And so I called him and I said, "Well, I can't play bass," and he said, "Just say you can play bass," so I said, "Okay, I can play bass." I'll be honest, I was very much into the lifestyle. I just loved being on the road. I loved playing music, chasing women. ♪ ♪ Maurice is so funny, 'cause he was good at magic tricks, and he'd like to drink a little, as I did. Robin, I never really knew. I mean, I'd converse with him but not as much as the others. And I would bump into him every now and then wandering the corridors of the hotel. And there's Barry with his glamorous wife smoking a bowl, you know? ♪ ♪ My early days with the Bee Gees were, for me, thrilling, even though I can understand why it wasn't for them, 'cause they weren't necessarily selling out. - When we were broken up, the world changed radically very quickly. And that was the beginning of the period when there was just no interest in us at all. - Remember, we were on tour. They'd try to keep Robin from looking out into the audience, in case it was only half full. - When we got back home, I turned to more drinking. I'd go to the pubs. The police knew my car. I was becoming the town drunk. I mean, I think I had about 2 grand in the bank and lived next order to a fish and chips shop. - So by '74, we didn't think there was gonna be much of a future. When you become famous, you think everyone loves you and they're gonna love you forever, and it's not true. - All of a sudden now, we had to work the clubs at the north of England to pay the taxman, so we had the Sheffield Fiesta, the Golden Garter in Manchester, Batley Variety Club, great clubs of our time. - The Batley thing, it's where all the has-beens went to play, and not saying that they were has-beens, but it was like, "Oh, God, not Batley," you know? - ♪ Sunday morning, woke up ♪ - I was a waitress at the Batley Variety Club. I really wasn't a fan of the Bee Gees. The only thing I knew about them was, you know, Maurice was mar... Well, he was going through a divorce with Lulu. - Yvonne came in, and I saw her eyes. I don't know about the rest of her. I just saw her eyes. And I said, "I'm gonna marry her." And I knew I was gonna marry her. - He was so cute. His personality was amazing. - Maurice had this childlike quality, which is something very special in men. - He loved dressing up in police uniforms. Wherever we went on tour, they'd give him a hat, give him a badge. - Is that his wallet? - It's a badge. - Whoa! What was that? - I'm not showing you now. - People loved him. He had the best smile ever. - I remember him teaching me the showbiz smile, and he said, "Well, the trick is, "you don't move your eyes and you just go like this." And I'll be honest with you, I think Maurice was the glue that held it all together. - Oh, I'm Mr. Fix-It. Either some discrepancy between Barry and Robin, or if we're gonna make a decision about something, "Well, what does Maurice think?" But most of the time, I'm like my mum. I'm the peacemaker. - You know, if they'd not been brothers, they would not be together. No doubt in my mind. ♪ ♪ - I met the Gibbs when they were on a bit of a... Shall we say, a downturn in their career. Robert Stigwood made me, unaccountably, the head of his record label. I was only 21 years old. I truly believed it was because I was the only guy in the room that I got the job. It was odd to me because I thought, "If they can write those songs, how come they can't be consistent?" If you got the ability to write "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?" and "To Love Somebody," where does that talent go? - I mean, there was two albums in a row that were dismal. - Ahmet Ertegun said to Robert, "You know, maybe their time has gone," 'cause it was Atlantic who were paying for these recordings, and Robert wouldn't hear of it, of course. He would never let the Bee Gees go. - There was this thing about Stigwood... Stigwood and his loyalties. I had a kind of deep-seated resentment about the fact that, you know, they were still his favorite. I had come out of a long period of addiction and alcoholism, and I went into the sort of recovery period. ♪ ♪ All these musical ambitions came to the surface, so I went to Miami to record. ♪ ♪ - We had a conversation with Eric about making a comeback. Eric said, "Well, I've just made this album "called '461 Ocean Boulevard' in Miami. "Why don't you guys make an album in America "instead of always making an album in England, "and maybe the change of environment will do something for you?" - The studio there was unbelievable, and I think that's what the suggestion was about, really. I thought those guys were actually an R&B band that hadn't really worked that out yet. And I thought, "Man, this would be so good if they could pick up on what's going on in America." - I do know that they had to change something. That's when the whole idea of actually being more of a band together rather than, you know, musicians and orchestras and all that stuff. - Alan Kendall, who was a friend of mine, said, "The Bee Gees are looking for a drummer. You know, are you interested?" And I went, "Yes." "I think I'm interested. Yeah. I am interested." - We needed to get more energized and don't rely so much on the ballads that we had been doing. - We wanted to be a band so bad, and that was basically the birth of it. - We had a great bass player, Maurice. We had a great guitar player, Alan. So really, the only thing we needed was a keyboard player, and I thought, "Blue." ♪ ♪ - Dennis called and said, "Look, you know, I'm putting a band together "with the Bee Gees, "and I've spoken to Barry, and everybody's in agreement.

Let's do it," you know? - Barry offered him the job. - I'd always loved the music, but the first time you ever hear the Bee Gees just when they're in a room like this, you know, it's just magic.

And of course, everybody knew the Bee Gees. It was a surprise out of nowhere. I was excited. You know, they sing like angels. And they were as excited as I was.

It reminded me so much of growing up in Australia. - That's great, Rob. - And from "Jive Talkin'" onwards, we kicked it up. - The songwriting was just very unique. Nothing like it.

The falsetto is very much a Black tradition, but they've translated it into this interesting interpretation of soul. But I guess more importantly for me, it's emotional. - ♪ Ah ♪ Because we were so excited about this, we started writing songs for this voice. - It created another dimension of sound...

Robert chose to take the organization away from Atlantic Records and go private. Atlantic, who were not happy about that, said, "Well, you're not using Arif anymore as a house producer."

It was three times a night at any club that you went to. There was a whole industry that was built around this clubbing thing. "Billboard" started a chart that was dance music chart. This billion-dollar industry was being built way before the Bee Gees. A lot of people don't realize disco started in the gay and the Black community. People don't understand what it was like back then for gay people. There was a law in New York that did not allow people of the same sex to dance together in a place that had a liquor license. And then the law changed, and that allowed me to open my club. - ♪ Whoo-hoo ♪ - A new era of dance music started in the gay underground clubs. - So the record industry wants to name it, package it, sell it. That was the explosion of the disco sound. - ♪ Dream world ♪ ♪ ♪ - We're down at Criteria Sound Studios, and currently, it's the studio that's being used by the Bee Gees.

We create better here than we do anywhere else. - Yeah. - That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. America was the ultimate dream.

But I never knew he existed until one day, he shows up fresh from Australia. - Andy was a great kid. He could do anything he set his mind to. - Barry was Andy's idol. They were almost like twins. - We were very much alike. We looked alike. We had the same birthmarks. I would say that we were as much like twins as Maurice and Robin. - "Main Course" and "Children of the World," which followed that, they were, like, triple platinum. I think he really wanted to be a part of that. - They suggested that I go to Australia, as my brothers first did in 1958 when I was only five months old, and start working there and get some records released. - Andy was very young then. He had his little band. - It was a process of building him up, getting him to play live, getting him to be an artist. - I was there for two years. Out of the blue, a phone call came from my brother Barry and said, "I wanna produce you," and I think it was, like, two weeks or something, I was in the studio to do a new album in Miami. I didn't think I was ready. - The first few times on a real professional studio microphone, Andy was, like, petrified, but, you know, Barry was there and guided him through and helped him with lyrics.

Disco was really underway, in Manhattan, anyway, but Nik Cohn's point was that rather than just being underground gay clubs, straight couples are now going to do the hustle on a Saturday night in the suburbs. So I got Robert to buy the film rights to a magazine article, of which there was no story. But it caught Robert's attention because he saw that that's a lead role for an actor if it was a movie. He announced at the Beverly Hills Hotel at breakfast, "I'm signing John Travolta to a three-picture deal," and people thought he was mad. He was a TV actor. No one gets a million dollars for three pictures. Turned out to be the bargain of the century, of course, because he got him for "Grease" and the movie we don't talk about, "Moment by Moment," but two out of three's not bad.

We knew they were busy. "But have you got some songs?" Robert said, and they said, "Yeah, sure." - Robert said, "I'm sending you a script." But we decided not to read the script. - We weren't writing the "Fever" music. We were writing our new album and just having fun doing it. - They already had a couple of tunes or some titles, anyway.

"That's so cool." - We had the demos, and then we went into the process of making real records. - Barry and Carl and I lived in that control room, I don't know, 16 hours a day. - Yeah.

It'd need to be called 'Saturday Night, '" he said. So it turned into "Saturday Night Fever." ♪ Night fever, night fever ♪ ♪ We know how to do it ♪ - We were editing "Fever" on the lot at Paramount. I was deluged by Paramount people saying, "How's your little disco movie coming along?" So that was a bit patronizing. But the inspiring thing was that Stigwood, during postproduction, said, "Why do we wait for the release of the film? Let's put out a single now." And then he started with the heads of Paramount, like, "How many theaters?" And they told him something like 200. He said, "I'm releasing the record in every city. Why can't it be in every single city?" So they made a deal whereby if the record got to the top 20, they would increase the number of screens. If it got top ten, they'd go more. He said, "I need the first record to be number one." - Stigwood phoned up and said to Barry, "I need the best love song you've ever written for the movie." So we went into a room in the château.

Where there's money to be made, disco is the business. - We didn't categorize our songs as disco, but then we weren't thinking that way at all. We were just thinking about writing songs based on this discovery of this falsetto voice and how well that seemed to work. - What the Bee Gees brought, I always felt they brought melody to disco. Most disco at that point was melody-free, you know? This was a different take on disco. It was completely for... For the broadest possible audience. - You got the lyrics? - Yes. - Great. - Right here. - Okay. Let's go. - Straight into it. One, two, three, four. Right. Okay. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ - Hey, guys. - It's too slow.

As is per usual for Monday, a very busy day coming into town. I'm working at a top 40 station in New York, big one, WXLO, but it was known as 99X. And I was the morning news guy. Most radio stations had a very small playlist, and the Bee Gees probably had the top four, top five hits any given week. - 13 CFRW. Music of the Bee Gees and "Tragedy." - Get out on the dance floor and do one more with the Bee Gees. - All the Gibb brothers together, the Bee Gees, "You Should Be Dancing." You should be shaking that thing one time. - And for those of us at the radio station, we're... We're gonna take hostages. - And if you haven't had enough Bee Gees music yet, well, we've got more. Guess you could kind of call it over-giving. - And then Andy Gibb too. He was like the caboose on this musical train. It was like waves in the sea. - ♪ Nobody gets too much heaven no more ♪ - You're right on the top of the world. What is it that drives you back on the road? - When we make records and when we're in the studio, we never really see who buys those records. I think getting on the road means that to us. It means that we come face-to-face with people to whom our records mean a lot. But to be sure, doing a tour is an enormous amount of work. The only thing that I noticed that's not right is, it doesn't actually say the Bee Gees, and I think it should actually... The Bee Gees' name should be... It should be "Bee Gees, Spirits Having Flown." - The '79 tour was a complete sellout. - The Bee Gees hadn't toured since 1976, and that tour was a promotion for the "Spirits Having Flown" album, but it was celebrating "Saturday Night Fever" as well, you know. - 25,000 people are supposed to be here. - It's gonna be great. - You don't mind the Bee Gees in the rain? - No. - No, not at all. - We've been here since 9:00 this morning. - They're worth waiting in the rain for. - I mean, it was huge. Dodger Stadium, places like that. We used to dream of this. Having people in the audience like Barbra Streisand watching your show and loving it, you know, I mean, these are fantasies. You're in a sort of goldfish bowl on tour. You know, it's like, you don't see much of what's going on out there. - Anyway, the most important thing is what we're gonna do after the show. What do you wanna do? - That's what we're here to talk about. - It's here. The Disco Body Shaper, the brand-new exerciser sensation that's sweeping the country. Send for yours today. - Buy it today, be a disco star tonight. - Let's disco to Burger King. - It all goes back to one thing and the same thing that's happening now: greed.

And he is a disc jockey for station WLUP-FM out in Chicago, Illinois, and he hates disco music. - Steve Dahl was kind of hard to avoid in Chicago. ♪ ♪ Steve Dahl was on the radio saying, "Disco sucks. Disco sucks." I was 14.

That was my first job. - Look at that crowd out there. - 50,000 people, the largest crowd of the season, showed up at Chicago's Comiskey Park. Many had come for Disco Demolition Night, a promotional gimmick. 15,000 others had to be turned away. - Steve Dahl says, "We're gonna let everybody in the White Sox park "for 98¢ "if you bring a disco record, "and we're gonna blow those records up in the middle of center field."

That game will be forfeited. - The anti-disco movement was almost anti-Bee Gees at that point. - Ironically, the soundtrack to "Saturday Night Fever," the album that made them superstars, also branded them as a disco group. - Because you can dance to it, I mean, doesn't necessarily make it a disco song. I mean, you can dance to lots of songs. - You really don't wanna be labeled "disco"... - No, no. - At all, do you? - Because our music is a variety of different kinds of music. It shouldn't be called just that. - So people hated disco. Hated it. - We had FBI and Secret Service around the airplane every time we landed in a certain place 'cause of the bomb threats. It was scary stuff. - We were perplexed, 'cause I got that vibe from them. You know, "Why are people doing this?" - The Bee Gees claim some radio stations around the country are refusing to play their new single. - The Bee Gees are not allowed to have a hit because they had a lot of success with "Saturday Night Fever." That, to me, is crap. - Radio is, of course, very difficult to get back once you lose them. Back then, if you weren't on the radio, there was nothing. - Let's all grow up. We're just a pop group. We're not a political force. We're just making music. But I don't think there's any reason to chalk us off because we existed in the '70s and we would like to exist in the '80s, you know. Does anybody mind if we exist in the '80s, thank you? - It was so overwhelming, and the whole dynamic changed. - There were just crazy days. I preferred Maurice as Maurice not being a Bee Gee, if that makes sense to you. I preferred him as Maurice, not being a Bee Gee. - Suddenly, they realized that they were in a different position. Robin went through a kind of... It wasn't a breakdown, but it was just something where he felt very shy of being in public and doing things for a while. - The backlash was a very frightening experience. When things get to that point, you're out of control of the whole thing. - We thought the Bee Gees better go on the back burner for a while until this dies down or something, you know. We couldn't do anything as the Bee Gees at all. ♪ ♪ - Well, backlash, I'm really good on. Any band that is successful is going to have some form of resist... That's just the law of nature. When they get so successful, sometimes the only interesting thing to say about them is, "Oh, I don't like them. "Everyone else likes, you know, 'How Deep Is Your Love.' I don't... You know, it's stupid." For bands of my generation, you understand about the ups and downs. You can see it. Like, where are the pitfalls? What is the shit you're gonna take? When might this happen? When might that happen? For those people that were on the first wave of sort of global pop superstardom, if you wanna call it that, it was new to them. Like, "Why does everyone suddenly hate our band? "We sold 8 billion records last year. What's the deal?" So it's confusing. - It was not just the Bee Gees but the idea of dance in that period, it was no longer acceptable for this kind of music to carry the weight, to carry the industry. ♪ ♪ Everybody was at that point in their lives where they began to look for other things to do. And Andy was having problems too. - Andy? Andy... - I saw him in Malibu. He'd been involved with a lot of people who were doing drugs, and he was doing drugs. He was doing cocaine. I talked to him outside on the balcony, saying, you know, "This is really a nice house, Andy. "It's a nice car out there, that Porsche. "Really nice. You're not gonna keep all this, you know." And he said, "What do you mean?" I said, "You do what you're doing, "this stuff will vanish. "All this stuff will go. Your career will go out the window, everything." And he says, "I know. I know. I know what I have to do." - There was a lot of chaos that I didn't witness, but I was aware of it. We were scattered all over the place for a little while. ♪ ♪ Robin was either in New York, or Maurice was in England. I was alone at the time, and I got a phone call from Barbra. ♪ ♪ She asked me about writing songs for her, and that terrified me. I don't know if I can do this, you know? So I called my brothers, and I said, "This is what we gotta do. And let's do it." And that's how the "Guilty" album came about. We really could not get on the radio. So the whole idea was to write for other people. Let's be songwriters. Let's try and graduate from being a group that's probably... beginning to fade, you know? Let's see if we can dance around that. ♪ Life is a moment in space ♪ ♪ When the dream is gone ♪ ♪ It's a lonelier place ♪ - It was more about outlets for writing, writing songs that aren't Bee Gees songs.

Was it difficult taking the woman's perspective? - Oh, no. - It's our way of doing things. We will assume that role within the song to write the song. - After the Barbra Streisand album, managers would call up all the time: "Gee, can I get together with you guys? Will you make my record?"
