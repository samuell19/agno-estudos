Hello babe I ittle drink? All alone? How 'bout it, how 'bout a little drink? Looking for somebody? Won't I do? Buy you a little something to eat maybe? I onesome? Change your mind? I know this swell place. Nice little bar right down the street. Hey! Hey! Up to emergency for X-ray and general. Possible skull fracture. Traffic accident on fifth and spring, possible suicide. No identification. No name? You wanna name her? A mystery woman. Maybe she's the daughter of a wealthy herring merchant, caught in the web of an international spy ring. She knows five guys in a row. Oh, lucky girl. Hey, look, look who's here. Ain't that smitty? Sure, Smithfield Cobb, that's smitty. Why don't I call him to identify her? Is he still on the enquirer? He got fired a couple of days ago. How will I find him? Drunk. Yes I know but where? Danny's bar I'd say. What the number of that joint? It's main something. Main 1762 I think it is. Busy. Oh no honey you oughta know better than that I've been remembering about it, all day. Sure. Uh huh you ain't kidding. Yeah, meatballs and spaghetti. Rotten what'd you have? Who? Well I don't think you oughta honey, you know how it is. Hey wasn't that smitty? It looked like him yeah honey, yeah. What do you know, he didn't come in. He had a suitcase. Must have been thrown out of his boarding house. Set one up for smitty Dan. He'll be back this is the only place left in town he can drink under cover. That's not very complimentary to me Mr. Nelson. Smithfield Cobb comes in here cause he likes my conversation. We have some interesting cultural discussions. I bet Dan, did he ever tell you? Tell me what? We only converse about Peter ibbetson and the universe. Yeah we know, we know. He ever tell ya anything that would explain the, you know, the change in him? You mean what started him drinking all of a sudden. Yes mr Walker I asked him you did? Yes. I said one day after he'd had a few and was getting kind of ripe and talking kind of loose, I said Mr. Cobb, I said, what happened to you over there in the war that you came back so different? He is a different man you know. Came back and started hittin' the bottle just like that. Ah well, one day the most successful newspaper man in town the next a very unhappy person. And what did smitty say? Well, if I remember correctly it took him a long time to express it. You know how he talks when he wants to, a very fine vocabulary. But what it all added up to was, I should mind my own business. Hello smitty. Hello good evening Mr. Cobb. I thought I'd drop in and have a drink with my friends. We thought you thought that. You must be planning on a long stay with your friends. Last time he brightened this corner for eight days. What's your beef Nelson? Isn't it enough you took his job? I'm not proud of it. Lots of people have taken his jobs. Don't blame me for his condition. I only took the one before the one before the last you got reason to be sore, I'm a tough guy to follow. But you'll be pleased to know that I'm leaving the city. That's tough on the city. Newer and bigger opportunities. Pour me one Danny. Poured it when we saw you walk by. I see thanks. To Chicago and to you smitty my love, may you be the best city editor that stony Talbot ever hired. Stony Talbot? You, city editor of the Chicago record? Yeah, I just got Talbot's wire this morning. Then I want my five bucks back. Huh? That what I spent on the flowers I sent stony Talbot last month when he died well how do you like that? And I only got the wire this morning. You know Nelson I always suspected that you were the victim of a split personality but there's one thing I can't figure out. One thing? Yeah, if you've got two personalities why do you always use that ugly one? Listen you... All the best in the world to you smitty. When do you leave? Well since my statement has been doubted. Here's a ticket on the midnight plane, behold. Then you won't be needing that drink. Oh yeah vicks. It's for you smitty sargent vicks at the receiving hospital. Oh tell him I'm busy. Come on quit playing nursemaid, let me have that drink. He can't talk, same old reason. He's got a cork stuck in his throat. Hold that phone. Wait a minute. Well I sure enjoyed that drink. Pour me another one Danny. Walker's right Mr. Cobb. If you take that drink you'd never make the plane. You know that Mr. Cobb. They want you to identify an accident case. Some dame stepped in front of a car and they found your name in her purse. So what? Pour it Daniel he'll be along in a few minutes. I said pour me a drink. What about the lady in the hospital? Oh it's raining again and I'm comfortable here so what about her? I knew the stuff killed your stomach I didn't know it killed your conscience. Well you know now. You really oughta go, you oughta you know. It ain't nice to refuse. Besides if you take first drink you know you ain't gonna stop there. Identifying corpses is much better than spending the whole three hours here a whole three hours? That's strange talk coming from you my friend. What about Peter ibbetson? I thought you didn't believe in the limitations of time and space? Pour one for Peter llbbetson. You know I've been coming here for five months now and I've been hearing about Peter ibbetson, Peter ibbetson, Peter ibbetson and I never admitted it before but who is this guy Peter lbbetson and what's his racket? He was a guy in a play. And in a novel too he was in jail but he knew how to think so he escaped from the ugly reality of his life on the wings of his imagination. In his mind he was able to go anyplace he so desired. All over the world even back into the past, all in his mind you see. In a manner of speaking, that's how he got out of his prison cell. No bail? No bail just. Now do I get a drink? Mr. Cobb I'm going to refuse to sell you one. I wouldn't want it on my conscience that you missed your plane. Here's to Peter llbbetson Though I go to face reality I remain here in spirit. Well I guess I won't see you boys again. If any of you ever needs a job look me up in Chicago, we'll hunt for one together. What odds do you give me he never makes that plane? I never bet against friends. A wonderful fella, but he drinks Evening vicks. Hiya smitty. Hello smitty. Hi. Raining again huh? Mm-hmm. Well how's it feel to have a girl try to commit suicide over you? Even when you're just one of five and the last one on the list? I don't get it. As soon as I saw your name I figured I wouldn't need to bother anybody else. Yeah where is she? On four. Know her? How can I know her when I haven't seen her? Some babe who's heart you've busted. Those dames don't jump in front of cars my friend, they wind up marrying broken down guys like you. I miss that guy. It used to be nice when he was covering this beat. Not much of a beat for Smithfield Cobb. Oh I guess he figured it was better than nothing. You know I don't know why the dames go for that guy but they do. Even after he hit the booze they still came around. I wonder what he did to this one. What does a guy do to a dame? Hello smitty. Sargent vicks says you're identifying... Yeah, where is she? She's still up in X-ray, you'll have to wait. How've you been? Okay. She should be down any minute. Smitty, oh I'm glad you're here. I think I've got something ah go away junior. But I've got a woman. Congratulations. Huh? Oh no, I mean I think I've found a sensational story for tomorrow's front page. Some other time. But it's that woman you're supposed to identify. I've got a hunch it's a feature story. My first day on this beat and I find a beautiful woman, absolutely anonymous and with this in her purse. The congressional medal of honor. There aren't many of those around, they're kinda hard to get junior. See you're interested. It is a story isn't it smitty? Yeah it's a story. She must be some hero's wife or sweetheart or something. And if she is where is he? Where most heroes are probably. Oh. Did you see her? When they brought her in yeah. Would that be the girl? Yeah, yeah that's the girl. Then you do know her. I know who she is well who is she? Well come on tell me smitty, give me a break. You're not gonna write this yarn junior. I'm not gonna write... That's what I said what's taking 'em so long up there? I need a drink well you're not gonna try and steal this story from me are you smitty? Look junior this is an old story with me, I'm just writing the finish of it so lay off. But smitty... Look leave me alone will ya? Oh, hey smitty there she is. That's her. Come on let's interview her. I said lay off. Three and a half, two and all. Rats leaving a sinking ship. Mrs. ames this is an emergency hospital, this is also a holiday night, we've very busy and we... Hello doc, what do you know? Well smitty there are some people who think I don't know anything. Well after all, the stupid statement's you've made tonight... Mrs. ames, that is the most typical reaction of a neurotic that... I am not a neurotic don't you see that you're very anger at my diagnosis proves... Will you listen to me for a moment please? Sure. I was knocked down by an automobile. I was knocked unconscious and when I woke up my, my legs wouldn't work. I can't walk I tried to but I fell down and I couldn't get up again. And he said I was hysterical. I did not. I said it was a type of hysteria paralysis. Alright, what's the difference? There's a great deal of difference Mrs. ames. I've tried to explain to the lady that there's no physical injury to cause such a condition. Do you see what I mean? He practically says that I don't want to walk. Alright, that's what I believe. I believe the paralysis is due to some neurotic, some... If simply repeating that word is part of your plan... Some mental or emotional disturbance... Is part of your plan to give me a neurosis to prove your point... Rather than anything physical. The examination and X-ray showed no injury whatsoever... I have never heard such absolute drivel in all my life. If I could walk why should I choose to crouch here in this thing? I'm sure I don't know mrs ames but that's a very interesting question. They just left me here. Looks like it doesn't it? What do I do now? What do you wanna do? Well, get out of here I suppose. And go where? I don't know, I frankly don't know. Where were you going when um, when you were hurt? That's another thing, that doctor as he calls himself he said that only he said where were you going that you didn't want to go. Did you answer him? Well of course I answered him. I was on my way to see a man, I was very anxious to see him. Of course now I can't. Why not? Well I can't walk that's why not. That's what the doc said I never heard such nonsense in my life. I tell you I was anxious to see him. What about? Well I, just wanted to look at him. Why? I just wanted to know what he looked like. You're older than I thought you were. I beg your pardon? I said I thought you were younger. Younger than what? Younger than you are. I am I know you are that's what confused me. Mary, can I take Mrs. ames into one of the treatment rooms just till she gets hold of herself? Of course, four is open for a minute. Thanks. What is it smitty? Some books to balance, bookkeeping. Excuse me, I know I shouldn't ask you any questions but I... Well then don't junior plagiarist. Where are you taking me? Out of this fishbowl oh, thank you. It is difficult everyone staring at you. On the contrary nobodies even looked in your direction. By the way who are you? Why should you... Smitty, how do you do? How do you do? I'm a friend of your husband. You knew David? I know him very well. You say you are a friend of my husband. Didn't you know that he was killed in the war, two years ago it was. Two years ago this Christmas, on the 22nd of December, at the battle of the bulge. It was six o'clock in the evening. It was a hand grenade you see. He threw himself on it deliberately to save... They buried him there, right there. But I want them to bring him home so that he can have a funeral, a proper one. Just as the sun goes down at six o'clock in the evening because that's when he died you see. Do you know the hour he was born? What? Do you know the hour he was born? Why no, no I don't, why? If I were a doctor I'd have a chart headed why is the beautiful young Mrs. ames turning into a middle aged neurotic and right now I'd put down doesn't know the hour her husband was born but treasures every precious detail of how he died. Oh you would? And I'd be pretty close to getting the answer. You're like all the rest of them around here. You think I've lost my mind too. Sometimes I think I have myself. Things make me cry, I'm not a crying woman ordinarily. Here you are Mrs. ames, take this. Come on, upsy-Daisy. What is it? Just something to relax you. You had a pretty bad shock you know. I'm amazed anyone around here will admit it there you are. You'll be hunky-dory in a few minutes. What'll you do with her after she gets to be hunky-dory? Send her home of course, that is if there's nothing the matter with her. Well if there is something the matter with her? But there isn't I'll look in pretty soon. Now don't yourself in an uproar. I know Joe Burton who? Joe Burton he's the man you were on your way to see isn't he? How did you know? There was a list of names in your purse, his was the first name on the list. There was also a medal of honor. You should be very proud of that. The president once said he'd rather have one of those than be president. Really? I'd rather have my husband. That's a personal view. What other view is there, if you're a woman? Oh, well I didn't realize that women were a separate race of people. David was absolutely all I had. I have no family, no friends. David was always enough. That's a mistake people make. There were six of them why couldn't it have happened to one of the others? Which one? I keep resenting it. You see, he needn't have died. That's why they gave him the medal of honor. He sacrificed his life so that five of his companions... The man you know was one of the five men who who was selfish enough to have lived. Yes. I was going to see him, see them. I wanted to see them all why? Because I wanted to know if it was the awful waste I think it was. I thought if I could find one, just one out of the five, who was worth my husband's little finger. So that's why you can't walk. I don't know what you mean. You'd be in an awful mess if you found out they were worthwhile wouldn't you? I don't know what you mean at all. You'd have to unwrap yourself from that blanket of self-pity and start living again wouldn't you? Self-pity? That this war should have happened to you, that's what you're thinking isn't it? Well it happened to a whole lot of other people. Do you think you were in this alone? I didn't say I was. Then why don't you give David a break? David a, what are you talking about. Why don't you give him credit for knowing what he was doing? How dare you say that he died stupidly for no reason. I never in all my life heard such a... You don't hear anything except the sound of your own fists beating against your own private wailing wall. Does it seem like that? I'm sorry, you've got a right to. It must be that lovely pill. I feel all floaty. I'd like to meet him I really would like to meet him. Meet who? Joe Burton, all of them. When I can get around again you'll have to introduce me to him. I know all of them. Really? Well for heaven's sake what a... Don't call it a coincidence oh I wasn't going to. Well when I can get around again. I can't wait for that. I have to go some place in a couple of hours. At 12 o'clock. Well then you can't very well trundle me down main street in a wheel chair in the rain can you? What are you staring at? Hmm? Staring, you were staring at your watch. It reminded me of something, of a friend of mine. Look, if, if destiny sort of walks up and says hello you shouldn't throw it over your should do you think? What should you do with it? I mean it, it could be that you met me just so you could meet Joe and the others. Really? What an interesting theory. Let me tell you about this friend of mine. He's a wonderful old man. He says that time and distance are a couple of things that people just made up to make it tough for themselves, to fence themselves in, they're not true and he can prove it to you. He can? In other words you could be here and down on east fifth where Joe works all at the same time. Do you understand? Well, not exactly. Why not? What did Peter ibbetson have that we haven't got? Peter, oh you mean the man who was... Who refused to let a prison cell make him stay put. But he just imagined... At first he did yes, until finally it became reality. Look I'm a pretty good writer, yeah a critic once called an article of mine a vivid word picture. Word picture? That's right. If I could give you a vivid word picture of Joe would you try to see it? Would you try to see while you're listening? It's very important you've no idea. Important to you? Very. Let's call it a matter of bookkeeping. Bookkeeping? If I could make you feel better about David, if I could make you see the men that he traded his life for, perhaps you'd be more understanding about it than, than what you are. How am I? Ill, aren't you? Yes I am, I really am. Now listen carefully and try to see what I'm telling you. I'll try. To see Joe you have to walk along main street. Then you make a right turn and go down fifth street see? Then you cut across the street catty cornered to get to Barney's place, that's where Joe works. Can you see it? I saw it. I saw it this evening before my accident. I almost went in but then I couldn't Barney's place is the modern version of the old time saloon but the people are the same. This is the bottom of the heap. This 1s skid row here's where you find the leftovers and the forgotten ones. I can't see them. That's alright, that's because you've never seen people like this. Where's Joe Burton? First I'm going to show you Joe's girl Katie. > Without imagination there's no reality j? not much of a voice but it's a living. J? without imagination j Katie's around 18, she doesn't belong in this joint but Joe works here so here she stays. That's Joe over there He doesn't look like the wrecks who frequent this place he just works here, he's the bouncer. It's a pleasure to be thrown out by Joe, he does it so graciously, with style. Joe's moving in because one of the customers is getting out of hand. He thinks he can fly. I don't claim I can make a long flight but I can take off from here and fly, well I'll fly over to that table there and fly back, without touching the floor. And you think I can't make it don't you? I can tell by your expression. I don't say you can't make it. I simply say if you don't make it I'll have to throw you out. That's the silliest thing I ever heard of. A man can't fly from a bar stool. How do you know he can't? He hasn't tried but he... Now you've made me lose confidence in myself. I could have done it, I know I could have done it shame on ya. That's the worst thing you can do, is make a man lose confidence in himself. Did you hear what he said? He's right, that's the worst thing you can do, shame on you. Shame on ya. Well, I never. Hello hello I'm glad to meet you. I didn't know about you, I only knew about Joe. You can't know about Joe unless you know about me too we go together. It's not fair. It isn't? It's not fair that I should lose did you lose something? Yes, yes I did. I can't remember just now what it was. It was an earring, I lost an earring. I was on my way here, I had an accident. I can't walk that's funny, Joe can walk and he only has one leg. That's why he's a bouncer. It is? Yes, you see he has to prove that he's as good as any man who walks. Well I don't know anything about that. I only know that I can't walk. He made me come here anyway. You didn't really want to did you? You really were afraid to weren't you. Oh I was very anxious to see him, I saved his life, I mean my husband did. Could we sit down somewhere? I'm getting sleepy, it's the little pill I suppose. We would be glad to. Joe's over there at the table building our house. He is? Where's your lot? What? Your lot, haven't you bought a lot? No Well now you can't build a house until you have a lot to build it on, you have to have that first. You do? I thought first you had to have the wish to live nn it with someone you get me all mixed up and I resent it. You don't have to apologize, lots of people don't have any imagination. Joe, Joe this lady would really like to see what you look like. She hasn't any imagination. I know, she doesn't even think a man could fly if he wanted to. Everything has to be imagined first or it couldn't happen. I do have an imagination, I do. I couldn't be here if it didn't Joe, Joe don't let her see our house, she doesn't believe in it you haven't even got a lot. If you don't believe in it, it can never happen. I won't let you tear down our house. I don't want to tear your house down. You don't give other people a chance. You don't even know when your husband was born. I'll tell you when he was born, when he died. You aren't even grateful. David died for you. David died so we could build our house and you wanna tear it down. No, no I don't. But you haven't even got a lot yet. You can't build a house. You can build a house on a cloud. You haven't even got a lot. I don't know what there is about that that makes you so angry. That isn't a real house there you see, one breath and... We didn't know it wasn't real. Shame on you. Shame on you. Don't cry, please don't cry. I'm not ordinarily a crying woman. Mrs. ames. I think she's fallen asleep. Mrs ames. Mrs. ames I'm speaking to you. No, I didn't fall asleep, you said I did but I didn't. I was there I saw Katie and Joe you were sound asleep. No, no I wasn't, don't listen to her, I was there. I heard every word you said, I was at Barney's place. I saw Joe and Katie so clearly I'm sure I'd know them if I saw them again. I was afraid you'd fallen asleep and spoiled it all. Oh no, no I didn't. I saw that little man that thought he could fly off the bar stool. I heard Katie sing and I saw the house Joe was building on a cloud. It's not unusual for a sedative to make you have funny dreams sometimes. Now don't worry about it. She wasn't dreaming. Now don't frighten her. Of course she was dreaming. You were talking your head off. When I came in you were crying but you thought it was someone else crying. It was you were saying please don't cry. It was Katie, she was crying because, why should they make me feel guilty? It's Joe who ought to feel... Joe who ought to feel what? Where are you taking her? Dr Morton's Dr Morton will be here in a few minutes. He's conferring now with the doctor who examined you when you came in. Lori who is Dr. Morton? He's a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist? I don't want a psychiatrist. You'll find him very helpful. He'll get to the bottom of those bad dreams you've been having. I haven't had any dreams and if I had I don't want anybody to get to the bottom of them. Why don't you? Why don't I what? Want anyone to get to the bottom of your dream as she calls it are you afraid you might have to admit that you were wrong? Wrong? About what? You were absolutely starry eyed when you came back from Barney's place. You must have seen something there. If I was starry eyed as you call it which I don't believe, it was simply because I was interested in the fact that the experiment worked as it were that I was actually able to be some place that I wasn't. Is that what made you cry? Cry? Cry, you were crying. Why should they make me feel guilty. Why did you feel guilty? I blew their house over why? Well I had to show them, it wasn't really a house. What was it? Just paste board, playing cards. One breath would destroy it. I showed them did you and David plan a house? Oh no, no David was much to sensible to start planning before we were ready. Of course, now we'll never have a house. Joe Burton was too young to be sensible David knew that. David also knew that it's not the sensible people who'll build a new world, it's the Joe's, the youngsters who think a man could fly if he really tried. Is that the reason for all of them because they were young? No, no there were various reasons. Let's consider Eddie Pearson for example. Edgar Pearson, somewhere in Pasadena. He's left Pasadena. He's working in a bleak and desolate part of the desert. Will you try to see it? Yes. It's a long way. Do you think you can make it? Yes I can make it. Just sand and sky that's all and a thirsty tree or two, wasteland. But Eddie's a scientist, it doesn't look like a wasteland to him he has plans for it. I'm looking for Edgar Pearson. I'm his wife. What are you doing here? We live here, Eddie and I. You live where? Over there. How do you like it? Why it's nothing but a broken down shack. You talk just like susie's father. Susie's father? I don't know him. There he is. Father, she thinks I'm a fool. You're a moonstruck idiot and Eddie's a bigger idiot for dragging you into this. I want you to come home at once. I love Eddie is that any reason he can't be executive director of all my corporations? They were your corporations father not Eddies. Oh, she has a 40 room home in Pasadena. This is my home father. This harebrained idea of Eddie's may take him two, three years. Well if it takes him forever what of it? Why don't you give him a break father? Why don't you give him credit for knowing what he's doing? How dare you say he's stupid? He 1s stupid. What'll he get out of this? The satisfaction that he saw his own opportunity and made it perhaps the joy of playing his own hunch but above all the pleasure of working at something he likes. Do you like it? I ike what Eddie likes for if he didn't have this chance to break out of the rut he was in, he'd be unhappy the rest of his life. You see, you can't have a happy marriage with an unhappy husband. But you are sacrificing yourself and your comfort and your social position and your looks for a gamble. It is a gamble you know susie. You bet it is do you know that all financial statistics prove absolutely and without a doubt that most new ventures fail that's what David always said. Ah, David was a sensible man. My husband had a chance to take a gamble too about seven years ago it was. He could have left his good, steady rut, I mean job, at the major chemical company and gone off to some horrible sweaty jungle, something about research in rubber, he turned it down good man. Maybe he made a mistake. He didn't he was right. Why should you give up everything for this whim of his? David would never, never have asked me to do a thing like this. Perhaps he wouldn't, perhaps he didn't care one way or the other. Perhaps he'd stopped caring. You have no right to say that to me. You're trying to upset me. There's nothing funny about that. You're just laughing to make me feel ashamed. Please stop laughing. Eddie doesn't love you or he couldn't do this to you. Stop that, please stop laughing. David's gone. This is what he died for? So your Eddie could do this it isn't fair. Stop that, stop it. Stop laughing at me. Stop it, stop it please, stop it! Stop it! Stop it. Stop it, stop it. What was that? It must be the storm I never did see fddie Pearson you didn't have to. No I guess not. I know pretty well what he is. I think I know what he's like. That's good we're getting on. Are we? What about the third one? Who was third on your list? Francis Marino in glendale. Yeah There's a garden back of the little cottage in glendale. It's really just a backyard but frank has built a high wall all around it forming a quiet little world all his own. Frank likes gardening. He's planted things all along the wall. Yes I see. Trumpet vines and Holly hocks. And the usual rambler roses. But I don't see frank Marino. You will. What makes him better than David? That's what I want to learn. You will. What an adorable child. Cute as a button. Oh sorry. Oh little girl. Perhaps you could tell me... He's my father. Oh? I'd like to see him. So would I. Isn't he wonderful? He's the third man. His name is Francis Marino, I'm Emmy Marino. How do you do. You're pretty. Thank you, you're pretty too. And you look very intelligent. Oh thank you, so do you. You're trying to make me like you aren't you? Yes I am I haven't any little, I was looking for something, for someone. I know, I'll show you where. This way. Would you like a cup of tea? My father says that when company comes in the afternoon you should give them tea. But if they come in the morning you should give them coffee. Well I don't care for anything but thank you very much. I help my father, that's because my mother isn't here. She's dead. Oh I see. I'm sorry I didn't know. You must be lonely too. I don't have time to be lonely. That's because I take care of Barbara and Tony and fric and Amy. And booby. Oh. And daddy takes care of me. Who do you take care of? Well no one I don't have a little girl. Little boys need taking care of too. I don't have any little boys either. But there isn't anything else, it has to be either boys or girls. You mean you don't take care of anybody? I'm sorry. You must be selfish. We were going to have children really we were. I love children but David thought we should wait until we could afford it lintil it was sensible David thought that children would be a hindrance. They complicate things, they use up 10 years of your life. Didn't 10 years get used up anyway? Now you're being impertinent. I am not, I'm a good girl. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! What is it button? What's the matter? She says I'm trouble, she doesn't want me. Must you make everybody unhappy? I make, I? Hey you're the one who made me unhappy. David died for you when you weren't worth it. I was worth it because I had something to live for. What did David have? Are you telling me he didn't want to live? How dare you. I'm not telling you a thing. You're, you're trying to upset me. Maybe so. You have no right to when I'm mourning David. Mourning David, a lot of good that does him now. Of all the cruel... But mourning him makes you feel better and that's something isn't it? Now let's be sensible about this if you're such a sensible girl. David's been gone two years now, why are you mourning him so? After two years, what are you trying to prove? I don't know what you mean. I won't listen to you anymore. I won't listen where's she going daddy? She's trying to get away. From what daddy? From herself. Can she do that? No she can't. Let me out of here. Please, please, please. Please let me out. Now then, the next man, Sammy Weaver. You'll ike him he's what's the matter? I'm not going to listen to you anymore. Why not? Afraid? I've had enough. We still have another man to see we have two more oh that's right, two. Well I'm not going to have anything to do with them. I've seen Joe Burton and susie Pearson and frank Marino and here I am, I can't imagine just what your reason is for doing all this and I don't care. Just because you're able by some sort of hypnosis to induce me to try your experiment. You needn't think I'm complete fool. You were going to show me five worthy men instead of that you've, you... What have I done? You've turned this gradually into an attack on me. I don't enjoy being accused of, of... Accused of what? You were going to show me five men and all you've done is hint that I'm guilty of all sorts of... How dare you set yourself up as my judge. I'm not going to listen to one more word from you. What do you want to do? I wanna get out of here. You leave here in that wheelchair and you'll spend the rest of your life in it. I'm not going to let that happen. Oh you're not. Of all the officious, objectionable... Just what is your concern with my life? Just what makes you think you can step in here and... I've told you once my own private bookkeeping that's all. I'm not interested in the slightest in your own private bookkeeping whatever that is. All I want from you or anybody else in this world is to be left alone. Alright Mrs. ames I'll leave you alone. I'm taking a plane out of here at midnight. Sit there and enjoy yourself, whimper. Turn yourself into an invalid, a permanent cowardly invalid. How dare you speak to me like that, how dare youl! You don't want to get well. You want to stay sick. Alright shrivel into a whining, bitter old woman in a wheel chair alone and without a friend. If that's what you want you're welcome to it I'm walking out of here. Which is more than you'll ever do, you'll never walk! I will I will walk I will jan Janet I tried I tried I know you did, I know you did. Take it easy now, take it easy. It's alright, take it easy. You were going to go away. Please don't go, please don't leave me. No I'm here. I was too rough on you I shouldn't have done it I'm sorry. That's my. It's alright. It's only the storm, the wires must be down. This is Los Angeles you know, it happens regularly. Well smile can't you? That's better smitty I'm afraid, I don't want to be an invalid. You won't be. I don't wanna go back in this wheel chair. It's going to be alright now, you'll see. Promise me you won't leave me. I promise. Give me your hand please. Please hold my hand. Alright. I'll do anything you ask smitty only don't leave me alone. I don't want you to dislike me. Oh I don't, you know that. I'm not a bad sort really I'm not all my life I've tried to do what was right, I have truly smitty. I never wanted to hurt anyone. I always wanted to do what was good for people. That doesn't sound like much fun. You are a solemn type aren't you? You've lost an earring. Oh I guess it was... Don't take it off during the accident. No leave it on, it gives you an engagingly lopsided look sort of sort of what? Meaning free, unconcerned, unfettered. You get all that out of a missing earring? Let's go get us a bucket of champagne. What? I mean it, we can go anywhere we want to now that we've mastered the Peter ibbetson technique. So let's choose a very difficult place to get into just to prove we can. Well I... I know just the spot. It's out on the sunset strip, a very shishi nightclub, one of those places where a ham sandwich sets you back $10 providing they'll serve you a ham sandwich. Can you see it? Yes, it glitters. Perhaps they'll have a good orchestra, we might wanna dance. Still I'm used to going out and having fun. Now let me see you smile again. How's this? Very nice. But I can't go to a night club alone. I don't want you leave me smitty. Hold my hand. I'm with you and holding your hand. I didn't realize how attractive you are. You're blinded with those diamonds I'm a bit dazzled myself. Oh my goodness look at me. I hope you like what I choose for you. What a time I had with the color until I realized that diamonds are your color, you should wear them more often. Well thank you. What time is midnight? What difference does it make? Well something's going to, someone's leaving at mid... I don't know, I'm sure I have a wristwatch here somewhere. Don't you think maybe they're a little bit too much? Hmm, I don't know. Perhaps just a little? Hmm, perhaps. What shall I do with it? Oh toss it in the river. I tossed my school books in the river once. No kidding, I always wanted to but I never had the nerve. What river? Now there's only one river, anything else is just a stream. You lived on the Mississippi? Of course. Now here's the river see that bend there? I lived right there, littleville, population 840. I lived right across the river from you. Right there small town population 840. No Mud, nice, slimy, oozy mud. Yeah right between your toes. The sycamore trees with their branches in the river. And those little flowers with the centers you could eat. And when you throw a bottle in the river it goes all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Just think if I hadn't take the train to Kansas City. And if I hadn't taken the boat to st Louis. We might never have met and been able to reach across the river I almost missed the boat I know you did. But I'm glad you didn't. We should drink on that I can't think of anything better. To us us Mum's '26 I hope it's dry enough for you. I don't know mum's dry champagne from pop's root beer. Well what's the difference? Mum, pop, they're both fine people. Oh. Garcon! Shall I translate for you creeps? No, no, no, no need. No not at all, no need. With hollandaise I'll take the same on rye. Oh lovely. And they're such big ones too. We grow them on the premises. Fresh from the oyster to you. That's my cue. If you'll excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, and Mrs. ames. Tonight we have the pleasure of presenting a young man you've never seen before. It's the policy of this establishment to give auditions to promising young performers. Only by your applause Mrs. ames can we tell if you find him worthy. Here he is the fourth man Sammy Weaver. Relax, relax. I'm Dr. Morton, psychiatrist from Vienna. Psychiatrist that means when your mind goes I make it go. At present I am working in Hollywood as an advisor on psychological pictures. That means I tell producers and directors how different minds should react under different conditions in these psychological pictures. It used to be you went to a theater and you sat down and you watched a picture and you relaxed and when you walked out you said wasn't that wonderful? The boy married the girl you enjoyed yourself. That's no good. My job is to make you sit on the edge of your chair and worry and suffer and think and figure out why this should happen and when you walk out you should be saying no he was crazy, no don't tell me she was the cra, no she was, he was the cra, no she was the cra, no she was the crazy and I know because I was watching her because she, that is good for you. Oh my psychological picture is so different. In my picture I show that the mind is everything and the body means nothing. I don't care who's body it is Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth. Rita Hayworth, well. No, anyway it's the body I mean it's the mind, the mind. That is what my picture is concern. And I open up so different in my picture, I open up with a blur and then it gets clear and then it gets blur, clear, blur, clear, blur, clear, blur, clear. What is it? Who does a young boy with a magnificent body and he is walking down the street and he watches the beautiful girls as they pass him by and he looks at them and all he does is he tips his hat, that's all but you know what goes on in his mind? That is the introduction of the character. Then we show a flash back, a flash back of Rudolph as he went to his first psychiatrist and he walked up to the office and he knocked on the door. Doctor, doctor I haven't enough time in the day, I have to have more time, I'm getting rushed, I have to. Relax, relax, nurse hypo. 4,000 cc's, slice of lemon and a dash of bitters and leave out the cherry. Now this hypo is not as big as it looks, don't worry about that, shh, it's not going to hurt at all. Now shh, it's not going in just say to yourself that it is not going in. Didn't I tell you to leave out the cherry. Now just a few more gallons, it'll be all over. There we are now it comes out now it's all over, it's all over. There we are, see? Now just relax, relax, tell me everything you do from the morning till the night. Everything you do from the morning till the night. Relax, sleep. Eight o'clock, it's eight o'clock. Gotta get up and go to work, brush my teeth. Take a shave, take a shave. We go get dressed, get dressed. Down the stairs, down the stairs. On the subway. Here's my station gotta get off. Punch the clock alright number 47, 45. I unch back to work. Punch the clock on the subway, on the subway. Up the stairs, up the stairs. Go to sleep. Sunday my day off, get a brush wash your teeth, take a shave, take a shave. Get dressed, down the stairs, play golf. And now, we go way back to his childhood and we find out what is causing all this, he is crazy. And so now that I gave you a few hints of my picture and if anyone finds out what the plot is all about you write me. You remember my name, my name is, my name is, my name um, I usually know it, I just, my name, well you excuse me I go ask my psychiatrist. Do you like him? Well I guess that means Sammy gets the job. I wanna thank you Mrs. ames. I wanna thank you for giving me my chance. I didn't give you your chance, it was David. You know smitty don't you? Oh sure I know smitty. His name is Smithfield Cobb, he thinks I don't know that but I guessed. He's the fifth man. Tell me about Mr. Cobb. Oh he's the editor of the evening journal with a big office on the top floor. One of those crusading newspaper men, a ball of fire. A crusading journalist, a ball of fire. Know the guy long? Long enough to know the guy. Do you think it's a nice evening? 1 do. And do you think it's going to rain? 1 do. I now pronounce you two in love. You heard what the man said. Shall we dance on it? Well jan you've met them now, all five men. Yes, and thank you for showing them to me. Tell me were they worth saving? Yes smitty they were. Then you should be able to walk now. Come here, walk to me. I can't I can't walk smitty where are you? I can't walk then there must be something more. Tell the truth jan. Smitty, don't go. Smitty. It's time to tell the truth jan. Tell it, tell the truth. Confess. Smitty, smitty! It's now or never jan. I've waited as long as I can. Don't go smitty, I'll try to tell the truth. I'll tell it I never really knew it before. I haven't been lying I just didn't know. What? What didn't you know? That I've been blaming five men for David's death. I should have blamed myself. I felt guilty and I, I was trying to blame somebody, anybody but myself. I was mourning David so terribly because I felt that somehow that was a way of paying him back for what I did to him. I let him die with all his dreams unfinished. It was I who refused to plan a house, though that could have been fun. It was I who made him stay in that dull job he hated because I was selfish and afraid to risk my security. David did want a child, he wanted it very much. But my greatest shame is that I married him and never loved him at all I married him for all sorts of reasons but not because I loved him the way I should have loved him and he knew this it's too late to tell him I'm sorry. Oh but I am, I really am. I've said it David. I've told it smitty, I've told it now will you come back? Please come back smitty please. Smitty. Yes I'm here jan, come to me. But I can't, I can't walk smitty. Of course you can walk. There's nothing stopping you now jan. You can do it you can do it that's right, good girl. You can do it I'm so ashamed that's over now. I was such a dreadful... No, no you weren't. I ruined his life, I made him want to die. How can you ever feel toward me now what I want you to? Jan many a woman learned something during the war after she'd lost a man that she hadn't quite appreciated. They learned when it was too late, you were a little better than most, you tortured yourself with it until finally you became ill. Look there's a time to remember and a time to forget. I ife can't stand still there's an old hindu saying that, that we never bathe in the same river twice, the river flows on, circumstances change. It's time to forget jan promise me you will forget. Now then let's see you walk. Walk, you know, right foot, left foot. Well I'm still a little wobbly but I'm walking. You're practically dancing. Thank you Mr. Cobb. When'd you guess I was Smithfield Cobb? It suddenly all added up and I knew. Why didn't you start with the crusading journalist? Then you might not have had to go through all the others. Oh I do want to thank you. Nobody else could have done it, you knew that didn't you? That's why you persisted so. I am grateful. Why don't mention it madam. Our best advertisement's a satisfied customer. Smitty what is it? What's the matter? Oh, you do mind, you can help it, you do mind about me. No, no jan it's nothing like that. But then there is something smitty. You just admitted it. You just said it's nothing like that. What is it smitty. Good evening I'm Dr. Morton. I'll wait outside I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. The storm has thrown everyone off schedule a bit and we have no emergency generator, it's a serious situation for the hospital. Now let's see but this card says that you're... Yes, yes, I know but I'm alright now. May I go please? Well I must make out some sort of report. Just say that Janet ames was ill but that she's cured now. We'll talk about it some other time if you wish. Thank you very much doctor. Oh but Mrs. ames... Thank you doctor you've been very kind. I appreciate everything you've done for me. Goodnight doctor. Mrs. ames, are you Mrs. ames? Yes I am I have your things here. Mr. Cobb said you were leaving. Oh thank you. Where is Mr. Cobb? He's gone. Your purse is downstairs at the police sargent's desk. You can get it from him when you check out. Did I hear, did you say he was gone? Yes he's left he asked me to tell you. Why, where did he go? I don't know Mrs. ames he didn't say. Oh the elevator isn't running. The power's off, the stairs are over there. Oh thank you. Did Mr. Cobb go out this way? Yeah where was he going? I don't know lady. Well, have you my bag? I'm Janet ames I was in an accident ames she's the one smitty identified. Oh. Do you know smitty? Well yeah, he left a couple of minutes ago. Did he say where he was going? Did he go to his office? Office? Yes, yes at the newspaper. Will I find him there? What newspaper? The evening journal. Doesn't he work there? The gentleman is at the moment unemployed and likely to remain so. Well here you are, here's your bag. Will you check the contents and sign this release please. Thank you. Oh here's your medal. I was only looking at it. I don't understand isn't he Smithfield Cobb you know the journalist? Not since the booze hit him he's just a sauce. Smart enough when he's sober but when he starts oh brother. I see the guy's been dishing out a few lies. Not lies, word pictures. Sign that slip please. Doesn't one of you know where I could find him? Why don't you try Danny's? What's that? Danny's bar, an elegant rendezvous for a select clientele down on main near first. Thank you. I still think there was a story there. I hate counting on my fingers Uh uh uh uh. I'm closing up now Mr. Cobb, it's after 12. Besides you said just one drink. That's the smallest lie I've told tonight. As a liar I'm a five star expert. In fact I have any number of small accomplishments. Daniel, have you ever killed a man? No Well I have there were six of us in a shell hole, then there were five. You killed him smitty? There was a grenade, there wasn't time to toss it back. Two of us saw it, this other fella and myself one of us jumped it. The other fella jumped it. Sure he jumped what else could he do? I was his commanding officer, I told him to jump and he did. Didn't even stop to think. Didn't turn to me and say why don't you do it yourself. He just did it. But answer me one thing Danny, if you can. What right had I to order a man to die? Why didn't I jump myself? I was as close to the thing as he was, why didn't I do it? I don't know you needn't spare my feelings Danny. I know the answer too. Sorry lady we're closing. Lady I said we're closing. We open tomorrow at 11. Well I guess I'll go warm up a cup of coffee. Nothing like coffee to finish the day off. Fxcuse me. Look you're a nice girl, you got possibilities, get outta here, go home. I said go home. Alright, so I lied to you about Smithfield Cobb and all the others too, they were all lies. Joe Burton, he's just a tough guy in a saloon, a wooden leg doesn't make a man a Saint and you should see his girl Katie, the real Katie I mean, the hottest little number on skid row Eddie Pearson, he's not in the desert, he lives off his wife's folks in Pasadena and he loves it frank Marino and his kid, he's got her parked in her grandmother's house. And as for Sammy Weaver and his big chance, his idea of a big chance is a two dollar bet on the races. Finally the crusading journalist, the ball of fire, that's me, one step above a stumble bum. A pack of lies. They weren't lies smitty. Take a look at me, what do you see? A crusading journalist. And I still see all the others just as you showed them to me because that's what they really are, if you look at them with your understanding and not just with your eyes. But there is one thing I'm not sure about, when you kissed me smitty was that a lie? That depends on how you look at it, you're an attractive woman. Is that all? That's all that and your, your bookkeeping. That's right. I don't believe you. Well believe this then it's no good. If you'd gone out and hunted all over the world for the one wrong man you couldn't have made a neater choice. It's no good jan. There's something you're keeping from me smitty and I want to know what it is because, because I'm in love with you. Jan for heaven's sake give yourself a break, get out of here, go away. What sort of books are you trying to balance smitty? Jan you're just making it tough for yourself. We're through, what more do you want me to tell ya? All of it. Alright, I killed your husband. I was his commanding officer, I ordered him to throw himself on the grenade. So that's the reason for, this. And it explains your bookkeeping to doesn't it? You were paying a debt. Oh smitty there were 300,000 American's killed in the war. Were they all murdered by commands? Do all officers feel this way? All officers didn't do what I did. No officer has the right to. You didn't do anything. David made his own decision, he knew what he was doing. Shall I tell you something smitty? I don't think David even heard what you were saying to him. He was already on his way to that grenade and he was thinking here goes for Joe because he's young and here goes for frank because, because he has a child and for Eddie because he has that dream about the desert and for Sammy Weaver because he has a heart full of joy and can make people laugh and here goes for Smithfield Cobb, he's the best of the lot because he can see the hidden good in all the rest. He never heard your command smitty and if he had it wouldn't have mattered he chose to die because, because he himself had too little to live for. So we're both guilty, you and I and we'd better work it out together. We can help each other. There's a time to remember and a time to forget smitty you can't bathe twice in the same river. It's time to forget the past and start living for the future. I can tell you what it's going to be like, the future. May I tell you? Will you listen darling? Will you listen and try to believe in it? I'll show it to you. After all what did Peter ibbetson have that we haven't got? Close your eyes and try to see it. Smithfield Cobb is a crusading journalist with a wife who adores him. He used to be so mixed up but that's all over now. The Cobb's have a little house.
