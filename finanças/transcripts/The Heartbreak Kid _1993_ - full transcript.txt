(pleasant music) (speaking foreign language) (applauding) (applauding) Bravo! (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (laughing) (cheering) (speaking foreign language) (chuckling) (somber music) (clapping) (party cheering) (upbeat music) Woo! (car alarms honking) (men yelling) (traffic commotion) (faint radio news broadcast) Papa! Hey, Papa! (speaking foreign language) Give us a ride for school! (boys shouting) Hey, what? Woo, hoo, hoo! Papa! Go away! Hey, Papa, give me a hug! Come on, Papa, wait up! (upbeat music) (boys shouting) Papa! Papa! (train bell ringing) (yelling) Woo, hoo! Woo! (chattering) Vikash! Where's Con, man? I don't know. Probably blowing a jay. We're playing in 10 minutes, mate. Okay, everyone. It's obvious from your last assignment that none of you have any idea of how to go about answering an essay question. So we're gonna work through one together. "Of all the Greek states, Athens was a real victor "of the Persian Wars, discuss." And what's the first thing we do after we've read the question? Send out for pizza! (laughing) After that. Miss, miss! Con. Sorry I'm late, miss! I had to take my sister to the hospital. Okay, just sit down quietly, Con. She's got this shit awful disease. All he hair's falling out. We took her to a specialist. (laughing) I think she'll end up on "60 Minutes." It's true. No bullshit. Have you finished yet? Hey, man. What's your excuse, Jack-o? Come on, miss, I was just having a smoke. What kind of a smoke was it, Jack-o? Was it about long and about that thick? We've got the team worked out. And the first thing to work out is what the question is asking us to do. We need to analyse it. What, like a urine sample? (students laughing) No, by underlying the key words. Now what are the key words? Kosta? Aye? Anyone else? Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, what about you? Do you know what the key words are? (bell ringing) Woo! Hey, I didn't say anyone could move! Nick? Could you all sit down please? It's the final day for our soccer cup. No one's leaving until I've handed back you assignments. We've fought for this game all year. Yeah, I'm aware of that! Well whose side are you on? The final can wait five minutes. 17, Nick. The rest of you who did it haven't done much better. I mean, the way you're going, you might as well leave school. Take a shortcut to the dog cue. What'd you say, the dogs? Not me, mate, I'm not a fucking loser. Well this assignment counts towards your final mark. Oh yeah? Well if you don't like it, I can fix that. (paper crunching) Nick, I'm warning you. Nick, come back here! All right, the rest of you can go. (students chattering) I should report him. I should get him suspended. Yeah, so, go ahead. Teach the little bugger a lesson. Oh yeah, then what? He'd get into worse trouble. I mean, he's one of the few kids in my class who could get through if he tried. The rest of them, or most of them, have given up. Chris, stop it. You can't take these kids to heart. Well, if we don't, who will? Look, Chris, these kids, they're just factory fodder. They're a rung below us on the ladder. The worst thing you could do, love, it to bullshit to them they'll ever be anything else. Hang on, Brian, except good Aussie rules players, right? (students shouting) (upbeat music) (cheering) (cheering) (guy yelling) (players shouting) Let's go! Shut your face! Vikash! Yeah! Woo! (cheering) (upbeat music) (thudding) You all right? Kosta, get up, mate. The game's over. What're you saying, man? Kosta, fucking get up! Can't you see the boy's hurt? I'm all right, let's keep playing. See, there's nothing wrong with him! Let's keep on playing, man, there's five minutes to go! Can't you hear me?! It's over! Give me the ball. Give me the ball! Now soccer is totally banned in the yard from now on. You hear that? Dude, fuck that, man! Brian? Can't you let them just finish the game? Kosta seems okay. What did you say to me? I said let them finish the game. You mind your own business. It's not fucking fair, man! (guys shouting) It's not worth it. Let him go. Let him go! Go on. Come on. Come on! Come on. You gutted little Cretan. Guy: What a wimp, mate. (students laughing) Come on. Take you to first aid. Shoulda fucking hit him! (thudding) Look, are you gonna force me to call another teacher?! (thudding) Sit on the bench! Sit on the bench! He made a fool of me. What was wrong with the tackle anyway? Take your shirt off. So, what if Kosta fell on the floor and he'd be dead, big deal. Happens everyday. Come on, Nick. Since when did you know the rules? Anyway, thanks for sticking up for us, all right? Look, don't drag me into this! I won't have anything to do with this. Southgate is right! It is dangerous playing in the yard, look at you. Yeah, well, this isn't over yet, Papa, I'm telling you. You haven't seen the last of this. It's not over. You know why he hates soccer? Why? Because it's a wog's game, that's why. Oh, come on, that's not polite. How would you know? You've only been here for six months. We've been trying to get a team for five years. That bastard would never let us but only once. Now he's trying to wipe us out completely. Fuck him. Look, do you wanna stay in my class? 'Cause if you walk out again on me, ever again... Hey, hey. Not, "hey, hey." I won't have you back. You're lucky you're not on suspension. What're you talking about? What am I talking about? If it was any other teacher, you'd be on suspension straight away! I don't walk out on just anybody. So you're leaving the school already, Papa? No. Not that I know of, why? Well, you're getting married, aren't you? Yes I am. That was some party you had at your place the other night. Counted 60 cars out front. What were you doing there? Just cruising past. Anyway, if I had the chance, I'd get out of this dump too. If I'm leaving, Nick, I'll let you know, okay? Come on, you'll be late for class. Come on. What's wrong with you? Marie and Anna wouldn't let me with them. Jeez, what a disaster. You want me to come around and bash them up, huh? (giggling) I'm tired. Can I have a piggyback? Come on, let's have a piggyback. Get on. Ugh. Let's go. (upbeat radio music) Woo! Nick! Nick! (radio muting) What're you doing? We're having Multicultural Day at school. Can't you see I'm cooking dinner? Multicultural Day? Shit, we have that crap too. So what kind of wog do you wanna be? Turk, a Libo? Huh? Dago, Jap? We're Greek, Nick. Oh yeah, I forgot. So what do you need? A costume and some food. How're we gonna come up with a costume? Emmy's mom is making her a frilly dress. No worries, we'll just get the same machine out, mate, whip up a dress, easy. No problem. (man shouting) Dad's home. Dad! Dad! (man speaking foreign language) (girl giggling) Ah, yes. Nick. (speaking foreign language) Hamburgers. Hamburgers, good. They're having Multicultural Day. (speaking foreign language) This explains. Hey, we could make kourabiethes. We'll make the kourabiethes. After dinner, you can go and start it. All right? (speaking foreign language) I'll put more. How're you doing, Fitzroy? Ah, excellent, okay, that's good. No, no, we'll do Collingwood. Great. I'm gonna be home in half an hour. Uh huh. Wednesday, hang on a second, hang on. No, Wednesday is fine. Yeah, I can make that, Jack, no problem. Yeah? (laughing) All right, mate, I'll see you then. Yeah. Okay, mate, bye-bye. What was that about? It's a strategy meeting. What do you mean? I told you. I'm standing for council. Council? No, Dimi, you never mentioned it. Oh yes I did. No you didn't. I told you, Chris, I'm sure I did. Didn't I? Hmmm. Anyway, don't you think it's a good idea? Well, we'll be living around this area. Our kids are gonna grow up here. Why not have a business here? (laughing) Does that mean we have to go to functions and dinners? Mhmm. I'm not good at that. You will be fabulous. I hate it. You'll be great. Ah! Don't turn the light off. (chuckling) Why not? I wanna see you. We're engaged now. Can't I see you? Come on. Thank you. (giggling) (schoolyard commotion) (chattering) Hey, check it out. Polides, soccer ball. He's a racist bastard. He's a smart ass, he'll get his fair share. What yous doin'? Nice jacket. Where's the bloody sauce? Con. Give me the ball, mate! Watch this. Tran! Kick it, come on, come on! Kick it, man! Nick! (thudding) Fuck! It's your ball, that's what you want? Kick him come on. (thudding) Hey, let's go! They're beating up Tran! (thudding) Get up! Get up! (ominous music) What do you think you're doing, huh? What is it with you, man?! (students shouting) (ominous music) (thudding) (crowd commotion) All right, all right, all right. So there was an Asian kid involved in the fight, so what? Aye? Don't go turning it into a racial debate. For God sake. I don't think it's about soccer either. I think the issue here is self-esteem. Oh, here we go, here we go. Let's start feeling sorry for the students. What do you want, Christina? What do you want, total anarchy? Anarchy, give us a break, Brian. All right, Graham, all right. Serious injury. Now who is in control here? That's the question. Nick Polides is gonna be made an example of. What about John Rivers? Shouldn't he take some of the responsibility? Polides started the fight. He had a soccer ball in the yard against my specific instructions. Why can't we have a soccer team to play other schools? Because we've got Aussie rules! Any kid can get a gain? Except the Greek kids, aye, Brian? Oh, shut up, Graham. That's so bloody silly. This is an ethnic school. Some of the kids don't wanna play Aussie rules. Is that so incredible? Well they've got their soccer clubs, haven't they? Chris, you're not saying we should reward this kind of behaviour. No, no. I just think this is a terrific opportunity to get the kids to put something back into their school, make them feel positive about the place. Terrific opportunity. Terrific opportunity. Who's gonna couch them? Have any of you blokes got a spare afternoon? Well have you? (murmuring) I know I haven't. Yeah, that's the problem. Never the staffing. Well, I'll coach them. I'll coach them. You? (Southgate laughing) Sorry. You're kidding, aren't you? No. There's nothing against it in the rule book. Are you serious about this? Yes. Yep. (bell ringing) Well, Brian, we'll have to make the oval available. Work out a time. The most half-assed idea I've heard in my bloody life! (staff chattering) I got off with a warning. Next time, I'm gonna get suspended. You wanted to see me? Yeah, take a seat. We're gonna have an official school soccer team. Are you kidding? No, and I'm the coach. What do you know about soccer? Well, I've been reading up about it. You can't learn soccer out of a book. Well, be relying on the more experienced players to help me. Are you interested? How'd you talk those jerks into this? Are you in or out? I don't know. Are we gonna play in the inter schools or what? Chris: Yeah, of course. You really are serious. Yeah, you bet I am. Yeah, I guess I could give the other players a bit of my experience. Don't get too carried away, Nick. Yeah, let's give it a shot. Okay. But there's a price. You keep up with your work or the deal's off. I can live with that. Good. You know what, miss? You're a legend. (giggling) (speaking foreign language) We letter-dropped half of Collingwood last weekend. So the campaign's going well. Yeah. Christina is helping me out. So when do you find the time? (speaking foreign language) Your new wife-to-be, she's the new soccer coach at school. (speaking foreign language) It's just until I find a proper coach. (speaking foreign language) Could be good publicity. Have to get her photo in the local rag, huh? (laughing) Christina? (mother speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) I'll take care of it, I'll take care of it, all right? Mom, I'm 22. He treats me like a child. You want to escape from your father, start making arrangements. (speaking foreign language) I wish you had told me about this soccer business. Why couldn't you tell me first? I'm sorry, I was gonna tell you. You're sorry, yeah. Dimitri, I was gonna tell you. Chris, listen, you're making a fool of me. I'm standing there like an idiot. I didn't mean to, it only happened recently. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's forget all of this. Let's get married tomorrow. Do you want in? Tomorrow? Let's get married tomorrow at the registry office. At the registry? You're crazy. No, no, I can do it. I can just see Uncle Yanni's face. (mocking in foreign language) (laughing) What about Mom? Momma? (mocking in foreign language) (shushing) Your dad. (gagging) (laughing) "Dimitri, how you do this?" (laughing) (faint beat music) (people chattering) This is our table. Is this us? Oh, this is nice. It's great. Got one near the floor. How have you been? One, two, three. Yeah. (father speaking foreign language) (announcer speaking foreign language) (giggling) (applauding) (cheering) ("Wedding March" instrumental music) (applauding) (announcer speaking foreign language) (glasses clinking) (festive music) Look, I got a plan worked out. Check it out. Voudaris. All right, he's not that big but, you know, he's a good infielder, okay? Chris: Okay. I know about a goal keeper. Tognetti is not that big either but he's pretty strong. Tran is really fast. Hey, slow down. I think the first thing to do is find a proper coach, don't you? But you said I could help. Yeah, you can. Well? Southgate been getting at you or something? No, no, no, no, I just wanna be smart about this. You wanna win don't you? What about Kosta? Nick? Nick's Father: Hello, hello. Hello. (speaking foreign language) You know my dad. Yeah. It's exciting, isn't it? Our new soccer team. Nick's Father: Soccer? Yeah. Happened a couple days ago. Soccer? Finally, after five years, we've got a team, huh? Chris: We're in desperate need of a couch. You didn't tell me. Well, it just happened recently. Mm-hmm. Chris: Do you know anything about soccer? A little bit, yes. Dad played for Hellas when he was young. Hellas? Before he came to Australia, he played soccer for Greece. Wow, that's perfect. Do you have any spare time? Do you think that this boy, that he needs another distraction? His marks are bad enough as it is. He'd need your permission to play, that goes without saying. His head is full of this game. Full of it! Okay, he devotes the next 10, 15 years to soccer. (speaking foreign language) He ends up on the production line at Ford like me. Or no bloody job. No, really, what kind of life is this for my son? Look, you don't have to coach the team, all right? Listen, you hide these things from me. You know, that's not better than telling a lie. Hide what? I didn't lie. It's worse than telling a lie! I didn't like, all right? Come on. I'm really sorry. Mr. Polides, I completely understand your concern for Nick's future. It's mine too. For are all my kids. But... I don't see what's so wrong with him wanting to be proud of you. You're his hero. That's more than most kids in his class. Yeah. Still, I think I should be the judge of that. Really. Please, excuse me. (applauding) (pleasant beat music) Chris: Are you okay? He doesn't give a damn about what I wanna do? Chris: Yes he does, he's just... One day, I'm gonna play soccer for Australia. Hey, hey, hey. You wanna hear something funny? My dad's angry with me too for coaching the soccer team. (giggling) Greek fathers are never happy. No matter what you do, they're never happy. (giggling) He just knows how hard it is out there and he's trying to protect you. You reckon? Yeah. He believes in you, so do I. Come on, I wanna dance. Come on, I wanna dance. (upbeat Greek folk music) (clapping to beat) (laughing) (cheering) Woo! (applauding) Your eighth birthday. (speaking foreign language) (somber music) (chuckling) (speaking foreign language) Your mother. She was... She was wise. She always knew what to do. (somber music) I'm not gonna play soccer, okay? Oh, no, no, no. (sighing) The plant is closing down. They told me today I've got no job. What? How can they close the plant down? There's hundred of people working there. Dad? We might have to sell the house. (shouting) Southgate: You don't have enough power! Throw it back, throw it back, throw it back! Come on, come on! Southgate: Good boy! How long is that bastard gonna... (Southgate shouting) Hey! Hey, there's Papa! Good afternoon, miss. Afternoon. Vasili: Good afternoon, miss. You're looking very nice today, miss. Did you get your parents to sign your permission forms? Yeah, we did. You know what they're calling the soccer team, miss? What? The Bi People. What're you people waiting for?! We're not done training out here yet! Yeah, okay, we'll wait, thanks, Brian. Southgate: Come on, you're not playing soccer! Con: There you go, miss. Thanks. Okay. Now, "the secret of affective attacking soccer "is learning how to play the ball early." Look who's here. Chris: "The attack takes initiative, "disrupts the opposition's game plan." Vasili: Hey, miss, you gonna read the book all afternoon? Con: Yeah, miss! When are we going out to the ovel? Come on. (players shouting) Hey, boys! Hey, now listen to her! She's right. You keep the ball moving, you can beat anybody. It doesn't matter if he's 10 foot tall. (somber music) Hi. I have some spare time. You want some help? Yeah, I sure do. This is Mr. Polides. Is it true you played for Greece once? Con: Of course he played for Greece! Yes, I played for Greece. I told you. You're right. Now come on! Let's go! (upbeat music) Southgate: What're you doing? This is George Polides. He's my assistant coach. And it really is our time. (players arguing) All right, leave 'em, leave 'em, leave 'em alone. Chris: Mr. Polides, what do you suggest we do now? Call me George, all right? Chris: Okay. Okay, bring the balls in! Let's see what you boys can do. All right, I want four groups of three or four. Two lines. (George shouting) (upbeat music) (hallway commotion) Serves you right for running in the hall. (laughing) Fantastic. (students chattering) Did you get my assignment? Chris: Yeah. Is that it? Chris: Yeah. I got my cousin to type it on a word pressure, so what do you reckon? It's very impressive. What about our deal, remember? Yeah, just let me read it. ♪ I feel it in my fingers ♪ ♪ I feel it in my toes ♪ What's this? It's for you, state of the art. Five hundred bucks worth. Isn't it stolen, Nick? It's for you, Papa, you deserve it. Get it out of my car. Get it out of my car! What're you talking about? This is outrageous. Get it out of my car! (music muting) I thought we were friends. Get out of my car. We are friends. I thought we had something going here. I guess I was wrong. Yeah, you were. Anyways, it wasn't stolen. I was saving it up for my car. (engine revving) (somber music) Giordano? Giordano? Yours is really late, Samantha, I haven't marked it. (students chattering) Very good. (somber music) What'd you get? A B+? That's good man. You should be happy. (bell ringing) Hey, Papa. What up? What's with the B+? That's a very good mark. And it proves my point. You could be working this hard all along. Well, anyway, what're you doing now? Do you want a cup of coffee? No. Just leave me alone, okay? What do I have to do to get an A+? Okay, listen! Listen, everyone! (shushing) Shut up! Shut up! It's my turn. (laughing) This is from me to you. Thank you. You're gonna love it. All: Aaaaaaaw! (laughing) It's a g-string. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) Husbands expect that kind of thing. That is if you ever set the date. What's this? That is a vibrator juicer. Not it's not! It is, it is. You can use it in the kitchen, you can use it in the bedroom. It's fantastic. Watch. Oh, oh, don't stop. Don't stop. (moaning) Christina? (speaking foreign language) (doorbell ringing) Hey, Papa! Nick. I told you to leave me alone. Hey, guess what, I went down to the library. What're you doing here? Listen, I was looking at this book, right, and I think me and Alexander the Great are related. Nick. Ow! You're crushing my foot! Yes, I'm trying to. Go! (Nick yelping) (thudding) (yelling) You broke my leg. (Nick yelling) (shushing) Are you okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. Why don't you dress like that to school, Papa? You're not hurt a bit. I am, look! I am, Papa, I promise. I got this ache in my heart, Papa. I can't eat, I can't even sleep at night, Papa. (shushing) Why are you torturing me like this, Papa? (speaking foreign language) Christina, you've got three toasters. Don't do this to me, Papa! (knocking) (groaning) Ow! What's going on? Oh nothing. Oh, yes there is. Nothing! Stay here and tell me. Chris: It's nothing. And who is he? Hello. Ev, don't encourage him, he's a student of mine. He's just been following me around. Oh, he is so gorgeous. Look at his ass. Oh, he is. Chris: He keeps staring at me, it's embarrassing. Em: How old is he? 17. Oh, God, he's so... Ev, I'm his teacher. Chrissy, at 17 they're at their peak. Go for it. Go on, you're not married yet.

(students chattering) (somber beat music) (whispering) Nick, are you coming? It's Saturday night, yes or no? You busy or not? All right, I'll come. You gonna be there, Nick? How you doing? (students chattering) Where abouts is it? You should read the whole chapter. Ah, come on. Could I borrow a piece of paper? Miss, we can't find it. It's not there. Who was he though? Just give us a clue at least. When do I see you next? (students chattering) (faint upbeat piano music) (muffled announcer) (Nick whistling) Hey, Papa! You're the shopper in your family too, aye? (laughing) Papa, wait! Hey, Papa. How're you doing? You live miles from here, don't you? On special, did you see that? Yeah, I've got some. Here, have mine, I'll get another one. No, I've got some. You sure? Just wait around, I'll carry your shopping for you. No, I've only got two bags, I'm fine. It's all right, I'll carry 'em. Can you hurry up, please? Just a moment. Papa, just wait. How much is it, quick?! Keep the change. Papa! Papa! Damn. Come on, I'll give you a lift home. Could you do that? Shit, that would be good. I could do with a lift. Woo hoo! Thanks a lot, this is excellent, Papa, I swear. Where are we going? Home, I told you. Wait a minute, we're gonna talk, aren't we? Oh really? What're we gonna talk about? Well, I reckon you've been coming on to me. (laughing) I have not. Well, you know you watch me in class. You never take your eyes off me. (moaning) Push your seat back. No, no, Nick, not here. Not here. What's wrong? (engine rumbling) Christina. (speaking foreign language) Yeah, I'm sorry, I had a meeting, Mom. (speaking foreign language) I'm sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Darling. I've got something to show you. What? (chuckling) Wouldn't you like to know. Where is it? Come on. Come with me. Chris: Can't it wait? Nope. (upbeat music) Huh? Follow me, follow me. Trust me. What's going on, Dim? Relax, will you? Look, I wanna show you one thing. Wanna ask your opinion on one thing. (laughing) Now, I don't want you to jump to any conclusions. You just tell me what you think. You won't believe this. (laughing) (upbeat music) You like it? Why we looking at it? (laughing) Is this Dad's crazy idea? He had a little bit to do with it. Anyway, it's old. Yeah. (laughing) To us, Chris. I bought it today. (laughing) (chuckling) This is not a joke? (laughing) It was an absolute bargain. Your dad put in 50 grand. Come here, have a look at the second bedroom. It's huge, make a great nursery. My parents live across the bloody street! Built-in babysitters. You have to be kidding. Chris? Chris, what're you doing? Chris, come here. Chris? This is how you pay me back for buying you a house! I don't believe this! It should be our decision! Yours and mine! Not yours and Dad's! Chris, I did it for you, it was a surprise, do you understand? Well you should've done it with me! Chris, come on. This is my life too, Dim. I think she was a little too surprised. Yeah, she... She'll get used to it. Yeah. Len will have a word with her. So, you see it's good to have the parents so close, huh? (laughing) I can't... I don't know. Hey, let's go to the club. I'll buy you a drink. All right, let's go. Let's go. There's nothing wrong with this house. Father: It's a beautiful house. (students chattering) (somber music) (traffic commotion) It's so nice to see you, I haven't seen you for ages! Look, you know I'm spending two weeks in Rome. Is there anything you want? Yeah, I was wondering if I could borrow your flat while you were gone. Is that okay? I was thinking maybe a gift or something. What, what's wrong with Dimitri's place? Oh no, it's not Dimitri. It's just being at home and Mom and Dad. I just want space, you know? Oh yeah? So who's the guy? What? You're obviously having an affair. Ev, I'm not! Oh, please. I knew you'd do this to me. Who is he? Is he Greek? Is he Greek? There is nobody. Nothing has happened. Do I know him? Is he gorgeous? Nothing has happened. Oh, please. Ev. Oh, go for it. Really, I'm pleased. Which key is it? Come on, I'm pleased for you. I've had thousands of affairs, and believe me, it is the best thing... Ev, I'm not having an affair. It would do you so much good. Dimitri will love you even more. Is that your taxi? I'm so pleased for you. Is that your taxi? Yeah, yeah it is. Now listen, there's a couple things I want you to do for me. What? Is change the sheets. Ah. Use condoms. Don't get pregnant and take heaps of Polaroids. I just want some space to think. Oh, I am so pleased. Take this, hurry up. Which key is it? Which key is it? Oh, no, no, no, this one. Bye. Good luck. I'm there in spirit. Have a nice time, bye-bye. Ev: See ya. Thank you, Ev. Ev: Bye. Now you gotta start taking your own initiative. You go to the library, you get your own books out. (laughing) You know, do your homework. (students chattering) (bell ringing) Okay, everyone, tomorrow we're going over the end of the chapter alphabetically, so please read ahead. That means you too, Giordano and Arthur. (students chattering) (sighing) Why didn't you come? I borrowed a friend's place. Meet me there this afternoon?
