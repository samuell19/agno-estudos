*Tima* Enobarbus! My friend Eros? Where is Mark Antony? Is walking in the garden. There are hard news come with this. Will desire your presence. I'll bring him to hom If it be love indeed, tell me how much. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd. I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth. Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure: his captain's heart,which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper, And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gipsy's lust. You shall see in him. The triple pillar of the world transform'd Into a strumpet's fool News, my good lord, from Rome. What news from Rome? Let Rome in Tiber melt! and the wide arch of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.. Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life Is to do thus speak not to us. Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight? Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony, He comes too short of that great quality Which still should go with Antony Alexas, sweet Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen? Soothsayer! Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things? In nature's infinite book of secrecy A little I can read Show him your hand. Good sir, give me good fortune I make not, but foresee. Pray, then, foresee me one You shall be yet far fairer than you are. He means in flesh Nay, hear him Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all: let me have a child at fifty, find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress You shall outlive the lady whom you serve O excellent! I love long life better than figs. You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.... Against my brother Lucius? and then, joinined their force 'gainst Caesar; Who from Italy, drave them. Well, what worst? The nature of bad news infects the teller.. When it concerns the fool or coward. On:Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus: Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death, I hear him as he flatter'd. Labienus This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,Extended Asia from Euphrates;His conquering banner shook from Syria to Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst-- Antony, thou wouldst say, O, my lord! Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue: Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome; Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase From Sicyon, ho, the news! Fulvia thy wife is dead Where died she? In Sicyon Forbear me. There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it: What our contempt doth often hurl from us, We wish it ours again; she's good, being gone; I must from this enchanting queen break off: My idleness doth hatch Enobarbus! What's your pleasure, sir? I must with haste from hence. Why, then, we kill all our women: we see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word. I must be gone. Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between them and a great cause, they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment: I do think death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying. She is cunning past man's thought. Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: Would I had never seen her. O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work Fulvia is dead. Sir? My wife is dead. Fulvia? Dead. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation; The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence. And the business you have broached here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your presence. No more light answers. For not alone The death of Fulvia, but the letters from Rome petitioned us at home: Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands The empire of the sea: The sides o' the world may danger: Command the officers Our quick remove from hence. You may see, Lepidus from Alexandria this is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes The lamps of night in revel hardly gave audience, or safed to think he had partners you shall find there a man who is the sum of all men' faults Noble Octavius! His faults in him seem as the stars of heaven, More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary, Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,than what he chooses You are too indulgent Let us grant, it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy; To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave; To reel the streets at noon, and stand With knaves that smell of sweat: say this becomes him, As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish,- yet must Antony no way excuse his faults, when we do bear So great weight in his lightness. Here's more news. Thy biddings have been done; Most noble Caesar Pompey is strong at sea; And it appears he is beloved of those That only have fear'd Caesar: I should have known no less. No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon Taken as seen; For Pompey's name strikes more Than could his war resisted. Antony, Leave your lascivious wassails When thou once Wast beaten from Modena, at thy heel Did famine follow; thou didst drink The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle that beasts would cough at Was borne so like a soldier, with patience more than savages could suffer 'Tis pity of him Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' the field; Pompey Thrives in our idleness. To-morrow, Caesar, I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I ... Till which encounter, It is my business too. Farewell. Farewell, my lord! If the great gods be just, they shall assist The deeds of justest men Thet Know, worthy Pompey. They will not deny you I shall do well: The people love me, and the sea is mine; My powers are crescent. Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make no wars out doors: Caesar gets money where He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both, but neither cares for him. Caesar and Lepidus are in the field: a mighty strength they carry. Where have you this? 'tis false From Silvius, sir. He dreams: I know they are in Rome together, Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, Keep his brain fuming; that Cleopatra sauce his appetite Pompey! How now, Varrius! This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome expected: Menas, I did not think this amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm For such a petty war: his soldiership Is twice the other twain: that our stirring can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony. I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together: His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar; His brother warr'd upon him; I know not, Menas,Were't not that we stand up against them all, 'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves; Good Enobarbus,entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech I shall entreat him To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,Let Antony look over Caesar's head And speak as loud as Mars. Your speech is passion: But, pray you, stir no embers up. Welcome to Rome. Thank you Sit. Sit, sir. Nay, then I learn, you take things ill which are not so, Or being, concern you not. I must be laugh'd at,If, or for nothing or a little, I Should say myself offended, and with youChiefly i' the world; when to sound your name It not concern'd me. My being in Egypt, Caesar, What was't to you? No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt: Your wife and brother Made wars upon me; and you were the word of war You do mistake your business; my brother makes his war against us both Of this my letters Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, It must not be with this. You patch'd up your excuses. Not so, not so; I 'm your partner in the cause ! You have broken The article of your oath Soft, Caesar. which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with. Caesar... No,Lepidus, let him speak: The honour is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar; The article of my oath. To lend me arms and aid when I required them; The which you both denied. Neglected, rather; Truth is, that Fulvia, To have me out of Egypt, made wars here; For which,I do here ask pardon on my honour Noble spoken. If it might please you, enforce no further The griefs between you Forget them quite For't cannot be We shall remain in friendship, . Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge O' the world I would pursue it. Give me leave, Caesar,--. Speak, Agrippa! You have a sister by the mother's side, Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony Is now a widower! Say not so, Agrippa: If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness. I am not married, Caesar: let me hear Agrippa further speak To hold you in perpetual amity, To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot take Antony Octavia to his wife; beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men; her virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter. By this marriage,all little jealousies, which now seem great,Would then be nothing. Will Caesar speak? Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd With what is spoke already What power is in Agrippa,If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'To make this good? The power of Caesar. and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs! Let me have your hand. There is my hand. A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother Did ever love so dearly: let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never Fly off our loves again! Happily, amen! I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me Time calls upon's: Of us must Pompey presently be sought, Or else he seeks out us. Where lies he? About the mount Misenum. What is his strength by land? Great and increasing: but by sea He is an absolute master Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it: Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, let's finish The business we have spoken of. With most gladness:And do invite you to my sister's view, Whither straight I'll lead you Good Enobarbus! Welcome from Egypt, sir. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle The heart of Antony, Octavia is A blessed lottery to him Charmian! Regina? Give me to drink mandragora Why, madam? That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away You think of him too much O, 'tis treason! Madam, I trust, not so What's your highness' pleasure? Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has: Hast thou affections?? Yes, gracious madam Indeed! Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing But have I fierce affections, and think What Venus did with Mars O Charmian, Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he? Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony! Do bravely, horse! for you know for whom you move The demi-Atlas of this earth, And we shall talk before we fight. Most meet That first we come to words; let us know If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword, And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here. To you all three,The senators alone of this great world, Chief factors for the gods, And that is it Hath made me rig my navy; I mean To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome cast on my noble father. Be pleased to tell us--For this is from the present-- how you take The offers we have sent you. There's the point You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon To part with unhack'd swords That's our offer. Know, then,I came before you here a man prepared to take this offer: but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience: though I lose The praise of it by telling, When Caesar and your brother were at war, Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly. I have heard it, Pompey;And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you. Let me have your hand: I did not think, sir, to have met you here The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you, That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither; For I have gain'd by 't. Well met you! I hope so, Lepidus Thus we are agreed: We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's Draw lots who shall begin Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there. You have heard much I have fair meanings, sir And I have heard, Apollodorus carried What, I pray you? A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier? I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight, When I have envied thy behavior I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye, Aboard my galley I invite you all: Will you lead, lords? We came hither to fight with you For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune. If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again. You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra? Caesar's sister is called Octavia True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius Pray ye, sir? 'Tis true Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together I would not prophesy so. Octavia is of aholy, cold, and still conversation. Who would not have his wife so? Not Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' the Nile By certain scales i' the pyramid; What manner o' thing is your crocodile? A toast to Lepidus!! Pompey, a word. Say in mine ear,what is't? Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain, hear me speak a word. Forbear me till anon. To Caesar! I could well forbear't. Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that? away! If for the sake of merit you will hear me, you arise from thy stool. I think thou'rt mad. Wilt thou be lord of all the world? What say'st thou? Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice. How should that be? These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable; And, when we are put off, fall to their throats: All there is yours. Ah, this thou shouldst have done, And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany; In thee't had been good service. being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done; But must condemn it now. Drink! I'll pledge it for him, Pompey. Bear him away! Ha, my brave emperor! Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals? Let's ha't, good soldier. What would you more? Good brother,let's ashore I'll try you on the shore. And shall, sir; give's your hand O Antony,we are friends. Come, down into the boat. Take heed you fall not. These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what! sound and be hang'd, sound out Captain, come Give me some music The music! music, moody food Of us that trade in love. Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian. My arm is sore; best play with Mardian As well a woman with an eunuch play'd As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir? As well as I can, madam I don't know.. we'll to the river: there,my music playing far off, I will betray Tawny-finn'd fishes and, as I draw them up, I'll think them every one an Antony,And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught 'Twas merry when You wager'd on your angling; when your diver Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he With fervency drew up. That time...O times! O, from Italy Madam, madam Antonius dead If thou say so, villain, Thou kill'st thy mistress but well and free, there is gold First, madam, he is well Why, there's more gold. But, sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat! Good madam, hear me Well, go to, I will; But there's no goodness in thy face Will't please you hear me? I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st: Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,. Madam, he's well Well said And friends with Caesar Thou'rt an honest man Caesar and he are greater friends than ever Make thee a fortune from me But yet, madam I do not like 'But yet, Prithee, friend,Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar: In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free Free, madam! no; I made no such report: He's bound unto Octavia For what good turn? For the best turn i' the bed Madam, he's married to Octavia The most infectious pestilence upon thee! Good madam, patience I'll spurn thine eyes I'll unhair thy head:stew'd in brine Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee, And make thy fortunes proud: He's married, madam Rogue, thou hast lived too long! Good madam, keep yourself within yourself: The man is innocent Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt. Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again: Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call! He is afeard to come. I will not hurt him These hands do lack nobility, that they strike A meaner than myself; Come hither, sir. Though it be honest, it is never good To bring bad news: Is he married? I cannot hate thee worser than I do, If thou again say 'Yes He's married, madam. The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still? Madam should I lie, ? I would thou didst,So half my Egypt were submerged and made A cistern for scaled snakes! get thee hence! I crave your highness' pardon He is married? he's married to Octavia The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me: Iras,Charmian! 'tis no matter Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him Report the feature of Octavia, her years, The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly Let him for ever go:--- -let him not Mardian,bring me word how tall she is. In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar Many times, madam. I am paid for't now. You take from me a great part of myself; Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife As my thoughts make you, .. .. Anthony! .. .. cherish'd. Make me not offended In your distrust I have said. So. ,,, ... ...; ... the gods keep you, And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well: The elements be kind to thee My noble brother! The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring, And these the showers to bring it on. No, sweet Octavia, You shall hear from me still; Be cheerful Come, sir, come; I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love: Look, here I have you; thus I let you go, and give you to the gods Adieu; be happy! Let all the number of the stars give light To thy fair way! Farewell! Where is the fellow? Half afeard to come Go to, go to Come hither, sir. Most gracious majesty,-- Did you behold Octavia? Ay, dread queen. Where? Madam, in Rome; I look'd her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony Is she as tall as me?? She is not, madam. Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?? Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced That's not so good: he cannot like her long. Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish! What majesty is in her gait? Remember, If e'er thou look'dst on majesty She creeps: Is this certain? Or I have no observance Three in Egypt Cannot make better note He's very knowing; I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet: The fellow has good judgment Excelent. Guess at her years, I prithee. Madam, She was a widow Widow! Charmian, hark? And I do think she's thirty Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round Round even to faultiness For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. Her hair, what colour? Brown, madam: and her forehead As low as she would wish it There's gold for thee. Thou must not take my former sharpness ill: I will employ thee back again; I find thee Most fit for business: go make thee ready; Our letters are prepared. A proper man Indeed, he is so: Why, methinks, by him, This creature's no such thing Nothing, madam. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend, And serving you so long! All may be well enough The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom. All which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you Good night, my Octavia, Read not my blemishes in the world's report: I have not kept my square; but that to come Shall all be done by the rule. Good night. Good night .. eternity was in my lips and eyes.... Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?? Would I had never come from thence, nor you !! Hie you to Egypt again Say to me,whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine? Caesar's. Antony, stay not by his side. thy spirit is high unmatchable, Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd therefore make space enough between you Speak this no more. To none but thee; no more, but when to thee. If thou dost play with him at any game, Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck, He beats thee 'gainst the odds: I say, thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him But, he away, 'tis noble Get thee gone: Say to Ventidius I would speak with him: He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him And in our sports my better cunning faints under his chance Ventidius! If I lose my honor I lose myself. Sir. You must to Parthia: your commission's ready; Două zile rămase. Sir... Though I made this marriage for my peace.. In the east my pleasure lies You stayed well by 't in Egypt? Ay, sir; we did . Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there? we had much more She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus? yes,There she appeared indeed; I will tell you The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick the oars were silver Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes . For her own person, It beggar'd all description: she did lie In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue O'er-picturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature: on each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did O, rare for Antony!! Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes, And made their bends adornings: at the helm A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands, That yarely frame the office. From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast Her people out upon her; and Antony,enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy, Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, And made a gap in nature. Rare Egyptian! She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed Now Antony must leave her utterly Never; he will not Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety: other women cloy The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies; for vilest things become themselves in her: that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish Lord of lords! .... ... Octavia! Octavia! That ever I should call thee castaway! You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause. Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony has become A market-maid to Rome. Good my lord! My dear sister, the adulterous Antony has turned you off Do not say so, my lord I have eyes upon him, And his affairs come to me on the wind Where is he now? In Athens? No, my most wronged sister Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her In contempt of Rome he has done all this and more In Alexandria, in a market place Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned... unto her he gave the establisment of Egypt, made her absolute queen This in the public eye? I' the common show-place, where they exercise Let Rome be thus Inform'd.The people know it; and have now received His accusations Who does he accuse? Cezar: for having Pompei spoiled of Sicily we have not give him his share then he say, he lent me Some shipping unrestored lastly, he frets That Lepidus shoul be deposed and, being, that we detain All his revenue. Sir, this should be answer'd.. 'Tis done already, and the messenger gone I have told him I grant him part but then, in his conquer'd kingdoms, I demand the like. He'll never yield to that Nor must not then be yielded to in this Hi is giving up the empire to a whore our world...You have a pair of wolves ...no more and throw between the food you have.. The one wil tear the other I will be even with thee, doubt it not. Dar pentru ce? But why? why? You're against my being in these wars, And say'st it is not fit Well, is it, Is it? If not denounced against us, why should not we Be there in person? Your presence needs must puzzle Antony Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,What should not then be spared 'tis said in Rome that your eunuch and your maids manage this war. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot that speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war And, as the ruler of my kingdom, will Appear there for a man. Speak not against it: I will not stay behind Nay, I have done Here comes the emperor Is it not strange, Canidius, That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea, And take in Turin? You have heard on't, sweet?? Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent A good rebuke, Which might have well becomed the best of men, To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we Will fight with him by sea By sea! what else? Why will my lord do so? For that he dares us to't. So hath my lord dared him to single fight. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;And so should you. Your ships are not well mann'd; Your mariners are swifters in Caesar's fleet Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought: Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea, Being prepared for land. By sea, by sea Most worthy sir, you therein throw away The absolute soldiership you have by land; Distract your army, war-mark'd footmen; Quite forgot your own renowned knowledge; and give up yourself to chance I'll fight at sea I have sixty sails, Caesar none better if we should fail, We then can do't at land. Canidius,Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, And our twelve thousand horse to our ship How now, worthy soldier? O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;Trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; Have used to conquer, standing on the earth, And fighting foot to foot. Well, well: away By Hercules, I think I am in the right. Soldier, thou art: but our leader's led, We are women's men. Agrippa? My lord? Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle, Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies Upon this jump. Retire! The egyptian queen flies! Sail! Retire! Retire! Naught, naught all, naught! Do not fight by sea!! Our fortune on the sea is out of breath! Gods and goddesses! The greater cantle of the world is lost ; we have kiss'd away Kingdoms and provinces. How appears the fight?? On our side like the token'd pestilence, Where death is sure. ribaudred nag of Egypt,-- Whom leprosy o'ertake!- -i' the midst o' the fight, The breese upon her, like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies That I beheld: Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, The noble ruin of her magic, AntonyClaps on his sea-wing and, like a doting mallard, Leaving the fight in height, flies after her: I never saw an action of such shame; Our fortune on the sea is out of breath, And sinks most lamentably Had our general Been what he knew himself, it had gone well: O, he has given example for our flight, Most grossly, by his own! Ay, are you thereabouts? Why, then, good night indeed To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse: six kings already Show me the way of yielding I'll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason Sits in the wind against me. ! the land bids me tread no more upon't; It is ashamed to bear me! I Have lost my way for ever: Leave me, fly, Make your peace with Caesar. Fly?Not I. Be gone! No, no, no. See you here, sir?. Out! Madam! O good empress! Sir!The queen! I have offended reputation,. O my lord, O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? O my lord, my lord, Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought You would have follow'd Egypt, thou knew'st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings, And thou shouldst tow me after: Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me O, my pardon! Now I must To the young man send humble treaties, dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness; With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased, Making and marring fortunes You did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword, made weak by my affection, would obey it on all cause. Pardon, pardon! Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates All that is won and lost: give me a kiss; Even this repays me Love, I am full of lead. Some wine here! Fortune knows We scorn her most when most she offers blows. Let him appear that's come from Antony. Know you him? Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither He sends so poor a pinion off his wing Which had superfluous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by? Approach, and speak. Such as I am, I come from Antony: I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf To his grand sea. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and Requires to live in Egypt which not granted,He lessens his requests; and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth, A private man in Athens: For Antony, I have no ears to his request The queen Of audience nor desire shall fail so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend, Or take his life there: So to them both. Thyreus! From Antony win Cleopatra promise, And in our name, what she requires; add more From thine invention, offers: women are not In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus. What shall we do, Enobarbus? Think, and die Is Antony or we in fault for this? Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason . What though you fled From that great face of war,why should he follow? The itch of his affection should not then Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,When half to half the world opposed, he being The sole question: 'twas a shame no less Than was his loss , to course your flying flags, And leave his navy gazing. Is that his answer? Ay, my lord The queen shall then have courtesy, so she Will yield us up He says so Let her know't To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities That head, my lord? To him again: tell him he wears the rose Of youth upon him; from which the world should note Something particular: his coin, ships, legions May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail Under the service of a child as soon As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore To lay his gay comparisons apart, And answer me declined, sword against sword, Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show Against a sworder! Caesar, thou hast subdued His judgment too. Madam,A messenger from Caesar. What, no more ceremony? See, my women! Against the blown rose may they stop their nose That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, then. Mine honesty and I begin to square. The loyalty well held to fools does make Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord Does conquer him that did his master conquer Caesar's will? Hear it apart. None but friends: say boldly. So, haply, are they friends to Antony.. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has; Or needs not us. So... Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats, Not to consider in what case thou stand'st, Further than he is Caesar. Go on: right royal He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you fear'd him Oh! The scars upon your honour, therefore, he Does pity, as constrained blemishes,Not as deserved He is a god, and knowsWhat is most right: mine honour was not yielded,But conquer'd merely To be sure of that, I will ask Antony. Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him? It much would please him,That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits, To hear from me you had left Antony, And put yourself under his shrowd, The universal landlord. What's your name? My name is Thyreus Most kind messenger Say to great Caesar this: in deputation I kiss his conquering hand tell him, I am prompt To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel: Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt. 'Tis your noblest course Give me grace to lay My duty on your hand. Your Caesar's father oft, When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in, Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place, What art thou, fellow? One that but performs The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest To have command obey'd You will be whipp'd! Ah, you kite! Now, gods and devils! Authority melts from me! of late, when I cried 'Ho!' Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth, And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am Antony yet. Take hence this Jack, and whip him! Moon and stars! Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here, what's her name, Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows, Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face, And whine aloud for mercy: Anthony! Take him away! being whipp'd, Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall Bear us an errand to him You were half blasted ere I knew you? Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome, to be abused by one that looks on feeders Good my lord You have been a boggler ever I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar's trencher Nay, you were a fragment Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours, Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have Luxuriously pick'd out: Wherefore is this? To let a fellow that will take rewards And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with My playfellow, your hand; Is he whipp'd? Soundly, my lord Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon? He did ask favour. If that thy father live, let him repent Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry To follow Caesar in his triumph, since you have been been whipp'd for it: henceforth the white hand of a lady fever you, Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar. Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say He makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful, harping on what I am, Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry! And at this time most easy 'tis to do't, When my good stars, that were my former guides, Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires Into the abysm of hell. begone! Have you done yet? To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes With that ? Cold-hearted toward me? Ah, dear, if I be so, From my cold heart let heaven engender hail, let the first stone Dissolve my life! Together with my brave Egyptians all, Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey I am satisfied Caesar comes near in Alexandria; where I will oppose his fate. Our force by land is nobly held; our shattered navy too knit again, and sails, threatening most sea-like Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, my heart?? If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;I and my sword will earn our chronicle:We'll beat them There's hope in't yet That's my brave lord! Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me all my sad captains; fill our bowls once more; Let's mock the midnight bell. We will yet do well. Come on, my queen; There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight, I'll make death love me Now he'll outstare the lightning To be furious,Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still, a diminution in our captain's brain Restores his heart when valour preys on reason, It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek Some way to leave him. He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power To beat me out of Egypt; dares me to personal combat, Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die; When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted Even to falling. Give him no breath Let our best heads know, that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight within our files there are, of those that served Mark Antony but late,enough to fetch him in. See it done And feast the army; we have store to do't, And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony! Enobarbus! Sir? He will not fight with me,? Why should he not? He is twenty men to one. To-morrow, soldier, we'll fight by land or I will live,Or bathe my dying honour in the blood Shall make it live again Woo't thou fight well?? I'll strike, and cry 'Take all Well said; come give me thy hand. Thou hast been rightly honest;--you have served me well, And kings have been your fellows What mean you, sir? To make your followers weep? Good friend, good night.Tomorrow is the day. . You that will fight, Follow me close; I'll bring you to't Call Enobarbus He shall not hear me What say'st thou? He is with Caesar Sir, his chests and treasure He has not with him Is he gone? Most so Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it; Detain no jot, I charge thee write to him-- I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master Dispatch! my fortunes have Corrupted honest men Enobarb. A plecat ca un erou. Oh, dacă el a decis să Cezar marele război luptă singur, apoi folosit Anthony... si acum... Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight Our will is Antony be took alive; Make it so known Caesar, I shall The time of universal peace is near: Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world Shall bear the olive freely Mark AntonyI served. He was my master. I will serve you honestly as I served him so I'll be yours Enobarbus, Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, the messenger came on my guard; and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules. I give it you! Mock not, Enobarbus. I tell you true I am alone the villain of the earth, Tomorrow we'll fight by land Oh, Anthony, eu lupt împotriva ta? You have been honest.. You served me well I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die; Forgive me in thine own particular; But let the world rank me in register A master-leaver and a fugitive Anthony! this is fought indeed! They are beaten, sir! fire in the air, we fight there too..... Look, emperor they fought up us there! Prepare, Scar. See Anthony be took alive! This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me! Mark Antony! This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me! Triple-turn'd whore!tis thou Hast sold me to this novice! Cleopatra, you will have my revenge! The hearts that spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave their wishes, melt their sweets on blossoming Caesar; Why is my lord enraged against his love? Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, Follow Cezar' chariot and hoist thee up Help me, my women! O, he is more mad To the Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall under this plot; she dies for't Is mad. To the monument! To the monument! There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead. Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself; Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'". O this false soul of Egypt this grave charm Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end, Like a right gipsy,at fast and loose, beguiled me to the very heart of loss Hei, Eros! Eros! Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish; A vapour sometime like a bear or lion A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock A forked mountain, or blue promontory With trees upon't, that nod unto the world, And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen these signs; Ay, my lord, They are black vesper's pageants My lord? That which is now a horse, even with a thought The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct, As water is in water. It does, my lord. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is Even such a body here I am Antony: Yet cannot hold this visible shape, I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,-- Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine O! thy vile lady! She has robb'd me of my sword No, Antony; She hath betray'd me and shall die Death of one person can be paid but once, what thou wouldst do Is done the last she spake Was 'Antony! Thy name so buried in her. Dead, then? Dead. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done, And we must sleep That thou depart'st hence safe, Does pay thy labour richly; go Off, pluck off The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart Apace, Eros, apace. No more a soldier: Stay a while I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra.and Weep for my pardon So it must be, for now All length is torture since the torch is out Lie down, and stray no farther ,all is done Eros! I come, my queen Eros! Stay for me Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze: Dido and her AEneas shall want troops, And all the haunt be ours. Come,Eros! Eros. What would my lord? Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack The courage of a woman art sworn, Eros,That, when the exigent should come, which now Is come indeed, on my command, Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come: Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st. Put colour in thy cheek. The gods withhold me! Eros,wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleach'd arms bending down His neck, before the seat Of fortunate Caesar, ? I would not see't Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured. Draw that sword. O, sir, pardon me! When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once; Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come Turn from me, then, that noble countenance, Eros! My captain, and my emperor, let me say Before I strike ," farewell" 'Tis said, man; and farewell Adio la un mare lider! Shall I strike now? Now, Eros Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony's death Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros , what I should, and thou couldst not. but I will be a bridegroom in my death, and run into't as to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros, Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead? Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly Who's there?? Take my aword and give me death My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee When did she send thee? Now, my lord Where is she? Lock'd in her monument She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass fearing since how it might work, hath sent me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,too late Too late Your star is falling, sir. You may not live. Hei, good friend.. Do not please the faith with your sorrow. We welcome to which will punish us and buried lately you will have my thanks for all??? O Charmian, I will never go from hence Be comforted, dear madam. No, I will not Anthony. Anthony! I am dying, Egypt, dying; only I here importune death awhile, until of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay up thy lips, Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not, come down:Lest I be taken I am safe Help me, my women And welcome, welcome.! die where thou hast lived Quicken with kissing had my lips that poweri! Thus would I wear them out I am dying, Egypt, dying: Give me some wine, and let me speak a little Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety They do not go together Gentle, hear me: None about Caesar trust but Proculeius My resolution and my hands I'll trust; None about Caesar The miserable change now at my end Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world, The noblest; and do now not basely die Not cowardly put off my helmet to My countryman,- Noone but Anthony could conquer Anthony Noblest of men, woo't die? Hast thou no care of me? shall I abideIn this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty? O, see, my women!The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord! O, wither'd is the garland of the war, The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls Are level now with men; the odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon. Lady! Madam! Peace, peace, Iras! No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares It were for me To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods; To tell them that this world did equal theirs Till they had stol'n our jewel Ah, women, women, look, Our lamp is spent, it's out! Wherefore is that? what are you? What you say? I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack: the round world should have shook lions into civil streets, and citizens to their dens He is dead, Caesar but that self hand, Which writ his honour in the acts it did, This is his sword;behold his blood Look you sad, friends? The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings Caesar is touched When such a spacious mirror's set before him, He needs must see himself O Antony! I have follow'd thee to this we could not stall together In the whole world: Whence are you? A poor Egyptian yet The queen my mistress, Confined in all she has, her monument Of thy intents desires instruction, She soon shall know Proculus. My desolation does begin to make A better life 'Tis paltry to be Caesar; Not being Fortune, he's but fortune's knave. Cleopatra, Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt! And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him I beg a kingdom. This I'll report, dear lady. Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied Of him that caused it. Hold, worthy lady, hold: Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this Relieved, but not betray'd Where art thou, death? O, temperance, lady Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir; If idle talk will once be necessary, this mortal house I'll ruin, Do Caesar what he can. To Caesar I will speak what you shall please. Say, I would die Most noble empress, you have heard of me I cannot tell.. Assuredly you know me What's your name? My name is Proculeus. Antony did tell me about you. I may trust you. I have no use for trusting Madam... Don't matter so.. I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony O, such another sleep, that I might see But such another man If it might please you... His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck A sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted The little o, the earth Most sovereign creature ...His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm Crested the world: his voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends. But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, He was as rattling thunder For his bounty,there was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas that grew the more by reaping in his livery walked crowns and crownets; realms and islands were As plates dropp'd from his pocket Cleopatra! Think you there was, or might be, such a man As this I dream'd of Gentle madam, no You lie, up to the hearing of the gods Hear me, good madam. Your loss is as yourself, great I thank you, sir Know you what Caesar means to do with me? I am loath to tell you what I would you knew Nay, pray you, sir,-- Though he be honourable He'll lead me, then, in triumph? Madam, he will; I know't. It is the emperor, madam Which is the Queen of Egypt? Arise, you shall not kneel: I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt Sir, the gods Will have it thus; my master and my lord I must obey Take to you no hard thoughts: What injuries you did us,we shall remember As things but done by chance. Sole sir o' the world, Cleopatra, know, If you apply yourself to our intents, Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find A benefit in this change but if you take Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes I'll take my leave And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we, your signs of conquest, shall Hang in what place you please No, dear queen,Our care and pity is so much upon you, That we remain your friend; and so, adieu My master, and my lord Not so. Adieu He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not Be noble to myself: what think you? Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves with greasy aprons, , shall Uplift us to the view; O the good gods!Nay, that's certain the quick comedians extemporally will stage us Our Alexandrian revels Antony Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness In the posture of a whore. I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails Are stronger than mine eyes Why, that's the way It's finished, good lady.The bright day is done. And we have it all done Now, Charmian! Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch My best attires I am again for Cydnus, To meet Mark Antony Good Iras, go. And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave to play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all. You bring me liberty My resolution's placed. Now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine. Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, That kills and pains not Truly, I have him. His biting is immortal Rememberest thou any that have died on't Very many, men and women too Indeed, there is no goodness in the worm. Take thou no care; it shall be heeded get thee gone Yes, forsooth. farewell I wish you joy o' the worm Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have Immortal longings in me: now no more the juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip: Methinks I hear Antony call; I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act; I hear him mock the luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath Husband, I come! I am fire and air; my other elements I give to baser life So; have you done? Farewell, kind Charmian Iras, long farewell Dost thou lie still? thou tell'st the world It is not worth leave-taking. Come, thoumortal wretch,with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie O, couldst thou speak,that I might hear thee call great Caesar ass unpolicied O eastern star! Peace, peace! Dost thou not see my baby at my breast... O, break! O, break! that sucks the nurse asleep?? As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle, O Antony! What should I stay? In this vile world? Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies A lass unparallel'd. Your crown's awry; I'll mend it, and then play Where is the queen? Speak softly, wake her not Caesar hath sent... Too slow a messenger dispatch What work is here! Charmian, is this well done It is well done, and fitting for a princess Ah, soldier O sir, you are too sure an augurer; That you did fear is done Bravest at the last, She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,took her own way. She looks like sleeping As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace. Take up her bed; She shall be buried by her Antony: No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous.
