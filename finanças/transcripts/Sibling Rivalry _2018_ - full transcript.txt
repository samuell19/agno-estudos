Come on, you f... Alright. Wait here. So we're doing this thing. Hey, Freddie. Terry. What are you doing? What? What did we talk about? What kind of criminals get caught? The dumb ones. No fuck-ups. Alright? I'm not spending the rest of my life in a concrete box simply because you couldn't stick to a plan. Understood? Now, let's get this done. But know this. Once you step inside here, you're in. No more of this pussy shit. Mate, we do this together, alright? The way Dad would have wanted. And what we start, we're gonna finish. OK. Now, I know we're wearing gloves, but try not to touch anything you don't have to. Can I take a seat? You're clean. You can sit. OK. Alright. So... Rodger will be here about 5:30 tonight to brush and reshoe Freddie. The buyer will turn up at 7:00. I've mapped everything out so we'll be ready about half an hour to an hour before Rodger turns up. Wh... why is this buyer coming at 7pm to try and put Freddie into a horse float? What kind of idiot loads a horse in the dark? I... I reckon Freddie will get spooked, don't you? Not our concern. Rodger organised it and he's with Mum all day. Besides, mate, it works beautifully with our schedule. The chances of anyone seeing us leave at night is the same as when we came here this morning - minimal at best. Now, you'll see that I've set the alarm for final idiot checks and exit - 6:15. You know, I still don't understand why we're here for the whole day. Because there's a lot to prepare. And we're only gonna have half an hour or so to deal with... to deal with Rodger. And what's with all the cleaning? You've got, like, seven cleans in here. Six. Mate, human emotions being what they are, if we leave the cleaning till after the fact, we're likely to miss something. I think you're gonna be surprised, Terry, how quickly the day's gonna go. - There's a lot to cover. - Oh, I can see that. And a lot of this stuff, I don't remember us ever discussing. These other things you've got - "ice junkie rehearsal", "electrocution"... Tez. Terry, look at me. As Dad would always say, failing to plan is planning to fail. I know that, Jeff. It's just a little intense seeing it all written down like this. You've done it like a to-do list. It is a to-do list. That's exactly what it is. You know what? Just... just forget this. Let's just keep moving, can we? Alright. OK. Let's synchronise watches. Seriously? I'm very serious. No short cuts. Yeah, but couldn't you have just said, "What time do you have?" instead of, "Synchronise our fucking watches"? Alright, what time do you have? I don't. Because, like most normal human beings, I use my phone to tell me the time. But you've taken that from me, remember? Find it? Yeah. We'll have to put it back afterwards, so I'll make a note in the agenda. Doesn't work. Wind it. Give it a tap. Dad used to say it had a heart for a battery. Give it enough attention, it'll work. Huh! What's that? Toothache. Alright. Let's synchronise watches for 7:14. It's time to ring Mum. Hey. It's Jeff. Jeff, Mum. Your son. Jeff. Yeah. Yes, yeah. No, we've just arrived. No, it's great. It's good to spend some time together. Big city, Sydney. Very loud, very noisy. Oh, no, he's off shopping. Of course he wants to talk to you, Mum. He's out... he's buying chocolate... chocolates for the kids or something. No, no, Jeff. Not chocolate. Sorry, hang... Not chocolate. The boys don't eat chocolate. What? - Sue doesn't allow it. - You're shittin' me! When Mum sent the boys chocolate at Easter, Sue spent a whole night, and I begged her not to, but she wrote this three-page essay on the negative impact of chocolate on kids. Don't ask me what it is. I don't get it. But Mum... Trust me, Mum knows. They can't have chocolate. You there? Mum? No, you misheard me. No, no, no, he's buying them for my... for... for me. H-h-how's your blood? Your blood levels, Mum. The markers, are they up? OK, well, what did the doctor say? Yeah, no, I kn... No... I hope you're not calling him "Dr Vindaloo" to his face, Mum. He's there to help you. Alright, and so... and the chemo? That's happening today? A-a-and wh-what about Rodger? Well, is he... is he staying back with you or is he still seeing... the guy about Freddie? Freddie the horse. The horse, Mum! Right. Right. Well, good. So, happy thoughts, hey? For the chemo. Positive thinking. Yes. Alright. I love you, Mum. Mum? I said-- Yeah, man. We're good. Rodger's gonna be here at 5:30. You're sure sat phones can't be traced? Yes, mate. It's half the reason why people buy them. Are you confident our phones made it to Sydney? The courier company will send the package back on Monday and the GPS will show that our phones had a glorious weekend in Sydney. We're good. Alright. What is there to rehearse? Rodger goes in the bath, appliance goes in the bath, end of story. When do we put the water in? Well, before, obviously. OK, me or you? Either. Now or closer to the act? I don't know. Whenever. And what appliance do we use? Hair dryer. She doesn't have a hair dryer anymore. She smashed it, remember? She's got no fucking hair on her head. The chemo! Then a toaster. They use the oven grill to do toast! Rodger thinks it's crispier that way. Come on, you know this shit. Well, obviously you have the answer. He kills himself with a Tasman X? Yeah. Why not? I don't know. It's got some poetry about it, I suppose. Poetry? Mate, this is serious fucking pathos. This is Rodger's first and favourite radio. Alright. Great. So, are we done? No. Cord's not gonna reach from the hallway to the bath. So grab an extension lead. No, no. Not those. That one. One of Dad's old ones? Mm-hm. More poetry. Oh, yeah, no, you should write fucking Christmas cards for Hallmark. No, uh, don't touch that. What, I can't make tea? We don't want to touch anything we don't have to, remember? Here. You got milk? Uh, leave it. Leave it! No, I've got... got gloves on. The power! But the fridge is already on. Mate, I'm no electrician, but you open that door, power surge, right? Which means spike in the usage meter. Which means someone was in an empty house before the deceased rocked up to top himself. Leave it. You know you're not supposed to eat or drink in here. Yeah, I know. Do you have a single memory of Mum ever opening or taking anything out of that fucking crystal cabinet? I still get anxious just being near it. And the last time I got a hiding... was in that chair. Really? Yeah. It was at Dad's wake. Cousins and strangers everywhere. Drinkin', eatin', bullshittin'. All I wanted was a quiet place to come and eat some of Aunty Shirl's ginger fluff cake. I don't know how Mum knew or where she came from, but... two bites in... flew in like a fuckin' ninja. She had some kind of... tripwire or something in here, I swear it. Yeah. I didn't get to the third bite. Wallop. Mum hit you at Dad's wake? Oh, yeah. A real stinger. I never knew that. Never told anyone. I had my first kiss in this room. Chrissie Holt. Man, I was so nervous. I practised kissing on the bathroom tiles for a week. I fuckin' hate this room. I'm gonna take a piss. Well, hang on, you... you can't piss in the toilet. I'm sorry? You're fuckin' kidding me! - Tez, it's a septic tank. - So what? - Water. - What about it? The power, when you flush. Surge. Where's the power come from? You don't have power in a toilet! - The pump! - Ohh! No, and... and you'll leave residue on the bowl. - What does that matter? - DNA. Yeah, but, J, we grew up in this house. This place is riddled with our DNA. Yeah, but... old DNA, not new. There's a difference. What? So, what if I want to take a shit? Well, unless you want to poo in your hands and... put it in your pocket, I suggest you hang on like a big boy. You know, the agenda, the rules, the piss bottle... I mean, you're starting to scare me, J. It's like you've done all this before. Tez, just because I'm not walking around shivering like a little frightened lamb doesn't mean this is any easier for me. I mean, Jesus, the worst I've ever done is a... dodgy tax return! I'm just being methodical, that's all. It's how my brain works. You'll thank me for it later. It's how I built my business up. What, the business you sent bankrupt? Seriously? You're gonna make today emotional? We're about to kill our stepfather for a block of land and an old house. Things are gonna get pretty fucking emotional, J, whether you like it or not. Well, can you just focus on the job at hand? And we'll both get emotional tomorrow. "Job at hand"? Yes! Oh, look... Think of me... like your foreman. Right? You're a brickie. You know, when you go on a site, you see the framework. Right? It's not your job to worry about the end result. Right? It's about the process. And in your case, it's about the bricks. You worry about the bricks. One brick after the other. Brick, brick, brick, brick, brick. Two, three hours later, we can both stand back - voilà, job done. - That easy? - It can be. You do know I haven't been a brickie for two years, yeah? No. I mean... Yeah. So what? Well, I know you knew, 'cause I told you when I got the new job. Do you know what that new job is? Look, you're gonna have to excuse me if I'm a bit rusty on 20 questions. I've got a lot on my mind. Besides... you probably don't even remember what I do for a living. You're the head of state operations for that new life insurance company, Heartbeat Services. It's the blue building on Chapel Street. Alright. And I know because Mum walks the corridors of the hospital stopping anyone that'll listen to her and raving about it. And if she's not banging on about it, then Rodger is. Rodger? Bullshit. It was his first Facebook post! I'd show you, but our phones are in Sydney. Do you mind?! God! The next piss I'm gonna take's gonna be on a tree. Did you bring the suicide note? Can I just have a minute here?! Jesus, Tez. I give you one fuckin' job to do. You'd better get your head in the game, mate. Can't have a suicide without a suicide note, now, can we? Why not? Dad did. Just give it a shake and get it done, will you? Oh, Terry! 13 words? That's all you could come up with? What's wrong with it? Mate, I wanted a suicide letter, not a suicide memo! No, I need more words! Why am I doing this, anyway? I thought we were gonna write it together and post it online straight after. No... No, no, neither of us are gonna be in any state of mind to write any kind of bloody letter after the fact. No, no. You need to do it now. And then when we're ready, we just transcribe it into his phone and then post it up on Facebook. Well... why would Rodger kill himself now, when Mum's only got a few months to live? Because of what you say here. "I am weak." Right? He's weak! You know, I just don't want to... hurt Mum any more than it has to. You know she thinks suicide is selfish. I mean, look at the way she talks about Dad after all these years. Well, then, we make it so that he killed himself so he could be the first face she sees when she walks through the pearly gates. Seriously? Oh, Jesus, Jeff! Rodger helped raise us. We're not even killing him for what he did or what he said he's gonna do. We're killing him for what we think he might do. There's no "might" about it, Terry. He gets the house when Mum dies. She made that perfectly fuckin' clear. Right? And he's gonna sell the lot from under us and piss off back to Queensland, before she's even dead in the fuckin' ground! But he might not. Well, then, we kill him for what he has done, alright? We kill him because he left a perfectly good woman and three kids to fuck our lives up. Or we'll kill him because his affair with Mum broke Dad's heart and he topped himself. Or we kill him because... we kill him because of these radios! He spent more time with these radios than he ever did with us. Mate, or we kill him because he's selling your kids' favourite horse, Freddie. I mean, whatever works for you, but we're killin' him! Rodger has always been about himself. He couldn't wait to get away from us to hang out in that bloody workroom of his, twiddling knobs and playing with valves and shit! He spent more time walking the dog and smoking weed than being with us. No, no, no. Mum raised us, not Rodger. It's not right that he comes to life now, right when Mum's about to die. We do this later. We're behind schedule. G'day, darlin'. Yeah, no, Sydney's great. No, no. Yeah, I'll send you some photos. Oh, yeah, I've taken some beauties. Yeah, Sydney Bridge, uh... And... and the Opera House and the, um... the Aquarium, Sydney Aquarium. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, in a couple of photos, it almost looks like Terry's smiling. Yeah, I know. I know. No, I'm joking. No. Yeah. I'll... I'll call you tonight. Alright, my darlin'. No, I'm being good. I haven't eaten any of that. Alright. We'll speak soon. See you, love. Why did you say we've taken photos and you're gonna send her some? We can't send photos. We haven't got any photos! It's fine. Don't worry. She'll never see 'em. No, no, no. No, she's used to disappointment. Don't worry about that. Never finished a single fuckin' diet she's put me on. No, I'll tell her that you deleted 'em. Easy. Why have I deleted them? Alright, I deleted them! Does it matter? It's fine. Anyway, you're up. So, important thing - when you're talking to Sue, I want you to say "Sydney" as often as you can. Really burn it into her subconscious, alright? So, "Sydney, Sydney, Sydney." Oh, hi. It's, um... it's me. I'm, um... just calling from, um... from Sydney. Um... Yeah, so, me and... me and J are here and... it's all... it's all good in Sydney. So, um... anyway, I'll, um... I'll be here for... for a little bit... little bit longer. But I'll, um... I'll, uh... Just thought I'd ring and say hi. So, I'll, uh... Anyway, um... say hi to the kids. That was quick. Yeah, couldn't get through. Went to her voice-mail, so I... just left a message. What are you doing? Tez. I'm not a fuckin' idiot. Why didn't you call Sue? You know what? Just forget about it. Tez, I'm not gonna forget about it. Alright? Sydney's our alibi if the suicide story doesn't stick. Look, you're having a lovers' tiff with Sue. I can see that. Right? But I want you to think about 40 years in jail and get the fuck over it and ring her back! She left me, OK? So now I have no alibi that's not... you, Mum or Rodger. Happy now? Tch! Why? Why didn't you tell me? What does it matter to you? Well, I could have helped. I've been there. I know it's not easy. Well, you sure make it look easy. I do? Yes. Oh... Look. We can't have any secrets with each other. Not now. Right? If they investigate the suicide as a murder, they're gonna interview more than just you and me. They're gonna interview Mum, our families, everyone. And it's gonna look bad if you're going through a divorce and I'm... - What? - What? Nothin'. You gotta get it right between you and Sue. Just for a couple of months, right? Tell her whatever the fuck she wants to hear. But make it right, mate. - You mean lie. - Yeah, lie. Lie your arse off! And stay free. Or tell the truth and go to prison. Pretty easy option if you ask me. I'm a shithouse liar, Jeff. You know that. It's why she's leaving me. What do you mean? She asked me if I still love her. - What did you tell her? - The truth. - Well, why would you do that?! - Because I'm a shithouse liar! She can see straight through me. I don't love her, Jeff. I'm not sure that I ever did. Not... not really. You know that's bullshit. No, I'm serious! I've been miserable for years. Oh, I know that. That's obvious. No, you should have left her years ago. She's a bully. No, I mean it's bullshit you can't lie. Anyone can lie. You just didn't want to. Look... tell me a lie now. Make it an obvious one. No! I don't want to! I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Lie to me. OK, so, tell you an obvious lie? Yeah. Alright. How about... I'm not having second thoughts about what we're doing here? Or I'm not worried something's gonna go wrong? Or I'm not worried as to whether I can do it? How about... how about I'm not worried we're gonna get caught? Or that I'm... not seconds away from getting on a bike and getting the fuck out of here? How did I do? Jesus, Tez. Look... Watch me. I'll show you. What? Rodger? He... No, you can't be serious. Rodger's dead? But... But that's impossible. No, you mu... you must have the wrong man. OK, why would he do it? I mean, his wife's in hospital dying of cancer. I mean, he's a Christian. He thinks suicide's evil. Cowardly. How did you do that? It's easy. I just imagined myself in prison being arse-fucked by Mungo the Hairless Gorilla every Thursday. It kind of gives me the focus to achieve anything. You're gonna have to learn how to lie, Tez. What are you gonna do when Mum needs comforting? When she's asking you, "Why did Rodger do it?" You're gonna have to lie to her, and lie to her with all your heart. Now, we've got 10 minutes before the next agenda item. I suggest you use it to practise staying out of prison. On Saturday, I was in Sydney with my brother, Jeff. We were just having a weekend... Where was I on Saturday? On Saturday, uh, I was in... Sydney with my brother, Jeff. But if you checked our phone records, that would show that our ph... that our ph... that we were in Sydney, wouldn't it? Fuck! You can check our phone records. The GPS in the phone would show that we... Oh, fuck! That would indicate that... Where was I on Saturday? I was... OK. Best-case scenario. Rodger comes through the front door, works his way into the, uh, living room. Sees us wearing the masks, thinks we'll rob the place. I'll tell him to comply, he agrees, and then we move on from there. Now, I know it sounds simple, but we should rehearse it. You play Rodger. Come in and I'll do the rest. - OK. - Alright? Yep. No, no, don't go out the front! No, no, no, no. Just... Someone'll see you. Just pretend. You right? Yeah, yeah. I'm good. OK. So, opens the door, closes the door. Comes in, opens the door-- Don't move! Do as you're told and you won't get hurt! Oh, um... Oh, please don't shoot me. Take whatever you... J, this... this really makes my face itchy. You'll get over it. Alright, let's just assume he's complied and we'll move on to phase two. Why would Rodger hang himself where Dad shot himself? Why wouldn't he... do it in his workroom? For the same reason he didn't sell Dad's tractor or any of his cars. It's guilt. Well, that, and the roof can take his weight. Oh, right. Alright, on your knees. Uh, it's not gonna work. Rodger's got a dodgy hip. Can't even put his own socks on. I don't think he'll get down there. Plus, it'll hurt him. What does it matter? He's gonna be dead three minutes later. Yeah, but there's no need for him to suffer. Alright, Rodger. Uh, how do we know his name's Rodger? Alright, Shit-Features. Sit. Now, I'll get Rodger to wear these, but for now, we'll just work with your gloves. You're not worried he's gonna ask why he's got to wear gloves? Not particularly. I couldn't give a shit. No, the gloves are so that if he scratches us during the struggle, won't get our DNA under his nails. You watch a lot of those crime shows. It's always the shit under their nails that get 'em in the end. Alright. How's that? Yeah, good. Oh, actually, I can kind of see a little bit. Really? It's hard to say. Not... not much. Just let me adjust it a bit. I think that's better. How about now? I can kind of see a silhouette. Like a ghost or something. Well, we're not trying to help him take a nap. It'll be fine. Food in a tube. Yeah. It's clever. No crumbs. Think if Dad could see us now, he'd approve of this? No. But he'd be proud of us. For looking out for each other. Protecting what's ours. You know, I spoke to Rodger about the will. You what? Well, I just told him we were upset. You know, and said it's... it's Dad's house, that-- I know the intricacies of our fucking complaint, Terry. What did Rodger say? Well, he said it was Mum's call. But he promised when he... when he died, that he'd make sure the house was returned to us. When he dies? Yeah, he said he'd put it in his will and... you know, make sure everyone was happy. Everybody'd be hap... That's frog shit. What about his first wife? His real kids? He might even have a brother and sister we've never heard about. People he's owed money to or fucked over. No, mate, they'll all come out of the woodwork when Mum dies. Mate, he left his first family hanging in the wind to come and play part-time daddy with us. No. Yeah, well, the same could be said about you. You got divorced. You cheated. You've got kids to two different women. Totally fuckin' different! I love my kids. I did everything for Mary. No, that crazy bitch got everything she ever wanted. The house. The car. That fuckin'... Louis Devonne bag thing. She's happier now than when we were together. No. Rodger's got our dad's blood on his hands. And the older I get, the clearer that becomes. The real mystery is, what the fuck does Mum see in him? Well, he's just got to buy her flowers every now and then and not hit her like Dad did, and I guess she's happy. Hey, you shut your mouth. You were a kid. I saw things happen in that house you wouldn't fuckin' believe. He did his best. Dad tried real hard. I know he made mistakes, but he fuckin' tried. And who knows, if Rodger hadn't have come along, he could have come good, and we wouldn't be having this fuckin' conversation. So, you show some respect. OK. So, the last two rehearsals have relied on Rodger playing ball. But if he doesn't, then we've got the last option. - The ice junkie option. - Exactly. OK. Let's say Rodger comes in and we lay out our intentions. He does a runner. We're not gonna be able to make it look like a believable suicide. Yeah, but, I mean, think about it. How fast do you really think he can run? Couldn't we just grab him before he... shoots out the door? No. We can't have bruises. No scuffs, no scratches. Right? A botched fake suicide is gonna create much more suspicion than a murder. So, let's assume he's come in, freaked out, done a runner. We need to make it look like we were ice junkies. He came in, interrupted us while we were robbing the place off our tits. You can just say "junkie." I don't think it matters what kind of junkie we are. Regardless, there's a few things we're gonna have to do. First of all, we're gonna have to throw a whole lot of shit around. Right? Junkies are messy people. Eat some food out of the fridge and get the right weapon. I think it's the stoners that get the munchies, not the ice junkies. Anyway, why can't we just use the gun? Because a meth-head is not gonna stumble across Dad's gun. No, no, that's never gonna happen. No, no. We use this. - A box cutter? - Yeah. Why can't we just use a regular knife? I've been doing a bit of research. You know, watching a lot of YouTube videos. Junkies caught on CCTV. Now, I don't know what it is, but whether they're robbing a 7-Eleven or some old chick for her handbag, ice junkies seem to have a thing for box cutters. So let's be authentic. - OK? - Yeah. - Now, important thing-- - Mm-hm? When we kill him, we kill him dead. Isn't that a tautology? I mean, if we've killed him, obviously he's dead. No, Tez. I think you'd be surprised. It's not that easy to kill a man. We can't just stab him like a fuckin' pincushion. It's not good for anybody. Yeah, especially Rodger. Exactly, because then we've got to sit around and wait for him to bleed out. No, no. The secret is to do what the Romans did. Now, the Romans, when they won a battle, all the enemy would be lying around dying and injured and shit. The Romans would mercy-kill them. Spike to the heart. It's quicker. More honourable. But what they wouldn't do is stab them in the front here. It's too hard. Bone. They'd come in under the armpit, where it's soft. Straight in under the chest, into the heart. Instant death. What, so the junkies now take their inspiration from the ancient Romans, do they? Well, we don't make it look obvious. Right? We stab him in a few other places, makes it look like the junkie got lucky. But if you're concerned about Rodger, you do him in the heart first, then do all the other stabbing after he's dead. That way, he doesn't feel it. Make sense? So, let's rehearse it. Do you want to be the stabber or do you want to be the stabbed? Jesus, Terry. Here. You're gonna have to clean all that up. I guarantee there'll be shitloads of DNA in spew. If things go down this way - the ice junkie option - do you think he's gonna know it's us? Terry. You're gonna have to get used to the fact that it's highly likely he will. Anyway, what does it matter? It's not like he's gonna be around to lay a guilt trip on you at Christmas dinner. I just don't want him to know it's me before he dies. Here. Scoop it all up, put it in the dam, wash it out. And I'm talking spotless! Hey, Freddie. Mr Muggins. I'm proud of you, Tez. You know, through all of this, we haven't talked about what we're gonna do with the place afterwards. Yeah? What are you thinking? Well, the place could do with a lick of paint. Bit of a tidy up. We could bring the kids up and do a bit of a working bee. Be nice to buy new horses for them to ride. It'd be good to bring the kids up here a bit more often. Don't you think? - What are you talking about? - Hmm? Are you seriously thinking of bringing the kids back into this house? The same house we straight-up murdered their poppy in? Well, yeah. Mate, neither of us are candidates for Father of the Year, but are you hearing yourself? Well, I don't mean... next week or straightaway, but eventually, yeah. I mean, this is the family home. Dad's legacy. He's the only reason we're sitting here, right? Yep. Yes, you're right. That's what Dad would have wanted. I'm j... Mate... I'm just being pragmatic. I mean, Tez, really, for God's sake, did you really think that the two of us would just bring our kids up here and live like the fuckin' Brady Bunch? No, no, we have to sell the place. The house has no value. Rodger ran it into the ground. No, it's... it's the land. It's the land and all of his antique radios. That's where the value is. No. No, mate, we have to sell. And Dad would say the same. Why haven't you had that seen to? What? Your tooth. It's not like you to put up with pain like that. You're normally the first to go straight to the doctor's the second you think there's a problem. What are you saying? That fancy new job of yours. What about it? It doesn't exist, does it? You don't have a job. Jesus, Jeff, why can't you just come out and say it? That's why we're here. Not because of Dad or what's right. You're bankrupt again, aren't you? Terry. You don't have to be hard up to do bad shit for money. If you've got none, you want some, and if you've got some, you want more. It's just the way the world is, mate. It's never enough and there's always some prick who wants to take it from you. Jeff, if you're in trouble again, I can lend you the money! No secrets, remember? Look, it's not too late. We can just leave now. Hey, look, tomorrow, OK, we can go to the bank together. I can take out a loan for you, no worries. Hey? I'd be happy to. What do you say? I'm not loaning money off my little brother. Why not? I mean, fuck pride, bro. That's just... that's just bullshit that Dad fed you. Look, I know we're different. OK, I don't live my life with Dad's voice in my head like you do. And yes, I'm sorry I wasn't straight with you at the start. OK, Sue has had my mind spinning. She's talking about taking the kids off me. I've been... I've been living in a fucking caravan park for the last month. OK? So, things are not going great for the both of us. But we don't need to do this. OK? It's ridiculous, bro. I mean, look at us. We're dressed up like a couple of fucking pumpkins! - Shut up! - If you... Listen. Oh! Fuck, he's early! J, I don't want to do this. OK? OK. Right. Remember, don't let him see you until he's come in and closed the door behind him. J! Did you hear what I just said?! Balaclava! Put it on! Move! Shit! What the fuck's he doing?! Shut up! Do you think he knows? Oh, yeah, you've got bigger problems, Rodge. Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck's he doing?! Round the back. Round the back! Oh, shit! - Do you think he saw us? - No, I don't think so. He's not even inside and this shit's going pear-shaped! Rubbish! Stop it! This is nothing! Just stay calm! Fuck! Freddie's out! What if he calls the cops? It doesn't matter if he comes in and finds us. It's our home. We haven't done anything wrong yet. Fuck! OK, look. If he comes in here, he didn't see us. Everything goes as normal, right? If he goes to his car, he spends too much time out there, he's called the cops, right? We take all this shit off, we tell him we're here to see Freddie. OK, good. Good. Nup. I reckon he saw us. Let's just say hello and forget about the whole thing. Shh! Hello? Terry? Are you in there? Hello? Terry. Answer him. Get him in here. Then back to our plan. No! If th... if there's somebody in there, then y-you'd better get out, because I-I'm calling the cops. Terry! You fuckin' do it! Or you and I are fuckin' finished! Choosing Rodger over me and Dad? - What?! - You heard me! Get out there! Fuck! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - What?! Oh, fuck! Hi, Rodge. Hell! It's just me. Hello. Oh, shit, boy, you scared me! Sorry about that. And you can't leave the feed out like that. It attracts vermin. And you left the gate open again. Yeah, I was just about to go back out there. Put the kettle on, will you? I need something to settle my nerves. Ticker's working overtime. What's going on here? What do you mean? Well, you... you're not a bloody troll. Turn some lights on, for God's sake! Well, the kettle isn't gonna boil itself. Yeah. You know, I might be getting old, but I didn't notice your car in the driveway. Yeah, I, uh... ...broke down. Oh, shit, no. How far away? Only about a 15-minute walk or so... I'd say. Is it the Volvo? Mmm. Where? Uh, it was... down on Dukes Road. Are you sure? I just drove through there. Yeah, I... arranged to have it towed. And what's your excuse for those bloody awful overalls? Has there been a nuclear spill I haven't heard about? No, I just had 'em in the... back of my car, and when I looked at the engine, I thought I'd put 'em on just so I don't get oil on my clothes. Shame you weren't that OCD when you were growing up, because I swear there's still bacteria in that room a scientist couldn't put a name to. You OK? Yeah. Rodger... did you know my dad before you and Mum got married? Oh, no, not really. Well, not early on. You know, when I first met your mum, I'd... just flown in to install the phones at the post office. She came in a few times, but... I don't remember your father being with her. He may have been, though. Why, son? So, the fact that you didn't know him probably made it easier for you when he killed himself. Jesus, none of it was easy, mate. You know, it was all a terrible business. Terrible business? Yeah. How was it a terrible business? Well, your father's... No-one expected it. Most of all, your mother, who took it very hard, as you know. And of course, you boys. What about us boys? Well, not you so much, 'cause you were only seven, but... it affected Jeff very deeply. You know, he completely closed down for a couple of weeks. Then when he finally did talk to me, he made it very clear that, you know, you boys had one father and one father only. He did? Yeah, well, of course. I understood that. You know, it isn't easy stepping into another man's shoes. You know, especially under such circumstances. You probably preferred to... spend time with your radios. That's a little harsh, don't you think, Terry? What I meant was I respected that. And I made it clear to him that I would never take the place of your father. You know, what happened back then was hard on you both, it was hard on your mother, and it was hard on me. Was it as hard as leaving your own kids back in Queensland? OK, look, yeah, I can see that you're upset about something, so... just tell me-- - Do you want some milk? - No, thank you. I don't want any tea. You know, I've had a long day with your mother's doctors. And I've still got to brush and shoe Freddie. Now, I don't know what's going on, but before either of us say something that we can't take back, let's just settle this conversation down a little bit and try... Wait a Gypsy minute. You're supposed to be in Sydney. Hit the fuckin' deck! Hands in front of you! Head down! Look the other fuckin' way! Hands on your fuckin' head! This. Put them on him. Bind his hands. Quickly! Don't fuckin' move! OK. Bind them up. Shut up! Stop looking at me! Here, put this on. Come around here. Put it on back to front. Not you, the fucking balaclava! Come on, come on! Alright. Give me your hands. Both hands together! Hands down! What the fuck, Jeff? Take the mask off! Get the... Jeff?! J?! Get in there! Jeff? Untie me! Jeff! J! Tez. Easy, Tez. Where's Rodger? Look, I know you didn't want to be involved in this and I know you wanted me to do it alone. But, mate, he's got old man strength. I need your help. We've got to do it together. Terry, get in here and help! Terry, get in here! Get in here now! Hold him down. Hold him down. Rodger, shh, shh. Shh, shh. Shit! Fuck, fuck! What the fuck?! No! No, no, don't! No! Jeff! Look out! Look out! The fuse must have gone. What the fuck, Jeff?! What the fuck was that?! It's over. We did it. Dad's watch has stopped. Made it through two years at war. It'll be fine. It's waterproof. OK, Tez. I think we're gonna have to make a move... Don't touch me! My name is Terry. Stop calling me Tez. Stop calling me that. I fucking hate it! Would you... would you like a little moment alone with Rodger? No. We leave now! Terry... Now, we can't go just yet. OK, you get dressed, I'll prep Rodger. Fuck! OK. We've got a problem. Rodger's phone. It needs a password. Do you know it? OK. Well... Doesn't matter. Like Dad, 40% of people that commit suicide don't leave a note, so... uh, we should be alright. Are you OK, mate? - Yeah. - Terry. Are you OK? Yes. I'm sorry, brother. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Fucking horse guy isn't due here for another hour. - I'll check. - No, no, no. You stay here. I'll check. Jeff, don't touch that. If the light goes out, they'll know someone's here. - You see anything? - No. - Who the fuck is that?! - I don't know. Whoever it is, they knew where the fuckin' spare key was hidden. You don't think...? What? Rodger? It's bloody freezin' out there. I'm gonna make a cuppa, love. You want one? She cannot be in here! What are you talking about? She's in, mate. We're fuckin' done. Then we have to get out of here before she sees us. - Oh! - What? Our bags are in the kitchen. Oh, Rodger. Why don't you wear your bloody hearing aid? Oh, fuck. OK, we need to distract her and get our bags and get the fuck out of here. Well, how are we gonna do that? I don't know, Jeff. You tell me. What did you put in your fuckin' schedule? This bloody house! It'll die before I do. Oh! Shitcakes! Rodger? Rodge? Rodger? Are you in there? I hope you're not up to any funny business, as I'm coming in. Mum, wait. Wh...? Terry! Wh-what are you doing here? Mum... You're supposed to be in Sydney. Yeah, I drove back today. Well, why? You just got there. I thought I'd just come and say goodbye to Freddie. That's a 10-hour drive, love. That doesn't make sense. I spoke to Jeff this morning. Well, you were there. You must have got confused, Mum. I beg your pardon! I have cancer, not dementia. I thought you were, um... getting chemo today. Pfff! Oh, they said my blood count's off. I had to postpone the bloody thing till Friday. You... Where is your brother? He's in Sydney. Rodger? Terry's here. I hope you're decent. He hasn't got a hearing aid, son, so just... you know, look away. Mum, I can't let you go in there. There's nothing in there I haven't seen a million times before, believe me. Mum, please. What on earth is wrong with you?! What...? Ohh! No! Rodger! No! No! No! - No! - Mum, Mum! Mum! Call someone! Help him! No! Mum-- Oh, let go of me! Leave me! I don't... I don't... He's gone, Mum. No... No! No! He's gone. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't understand. I don't understand. What... First your father, and now Rodger? What... what... what have I done to these men? It's not your fault, Mum. - Was I so terrible? - No. It's not your fault, Mum. I only had a few... months left with him. Why wouldn't he wait? Why would he do this? Why didn't he take me with him? What's that?! It's... it's nothing. Stay here. I'm gonna turn it off. It doesn't... It d... doesn't make sense. It doesn't make any sense. What are you doing? Do you really think... Rodger killing himself like that, when we just happened to be in the house, is gonna stand up to any kind of scrutiny? It'll have to! Maybe if Mum wasn't here. Think about it. Our bullshit alibis. The lies we've told Mum. There's no suicide note. And the fact that Rodger pulled her out of hospital and brought her here and popped in for a quick tidy up and thought, "Oh, fuck it. I'm out." None of it will stand up. - And you heard what she said. - What? "Why didn't he take me with him?" - That's what she wants. - No, it isn't! You know the pain she's in. And the cancer's just gonna grow inside of her and just keep fuckin' growing. You really want to sit back and watch her die in agony? And wither away... to nothin'? No, it's the most humane thing. It's the only way. And besides... it wasn't even really Rodger who was taking the house from us. It was Mum. It was Mum! I mean, she was the one that changed the will to suit him and not us. Don't you fucking say that! Don't you fucking dare! Hey. You don't hit your big brother. Especially when he's got a fuckin' gun in his hand. How's Sydney this time of year? Mum... You shut your mouth, Terry. I want to hear it from your brother. Did you have a good weekend, Jeffrey? Hey? Did you see everything you wanted? Hey? Opera House and the Domain, eh? Or did you do something else this weekend? Something... closer to home? Calm down, Mum. You're not thinking straight. You boys. You've got your father's weakness. Mum-- Oh! If he could see you two now. Shut up, Mum. You've always been a disappointment to me, son. I want you to know that. Mum... don't. Oh! What are you gonna do with his gun, Jeff? Eh? What are you gonna do with your daddy's gun? Mum-- He liked to paint himself as some kind of war hero. Hey? The only time he put that gun to good use was when he turned it on himself! You shut the fuck up, Mum. Jeff. Don't. Oooh! And there it is. Take a look at it. All pumped up with a gun in its hand. Stop it, Mum. Please. - You shut up. - Don't say that to him. Your father was rotten to the core. And you are half the man he-- What dirty fuckin' dogs you both turned out to be! The only real man here is lying back there in the bath! Jeff! What have you done? No. No. It's OK, Terry. Jeff, what have you done?! It's OK. A few seconds of horror. It's nothing compared to the indignity of her wasting away. No. Oh, God! She's with him now. No! Aaaagh! Oh, God! ¶ I won't forgive ¶ ¶ I won't forget ¶ ¶ I'm not so soft ¶ ¶ I'm not so wet behind the ears ¶ ¶ It's a cruel, cruel world ¶ ¶ We made a choice ¶ ¶ We crossed the line ¶ ¶ But now I find that there's no time ¶ ¶ To turn the clock back and rewind ¶ ¶ It's a cruel, cruel world ¶ ¶ Secrets and lies ¶ ¶ Are etched across your eyes ¶ ¶ You've a cold, cold heart ¶ ¶ It's a cruel, cruel world ¶ ¶ Turning your tricks ¶ ¶ Destroyed by the twist ¶ ¶ Of an ice-cold heart ¶ ¶ It's a cruel, cruel world ¶ ¶ I won't relive ¶ ¶ I won't regret ¶ ¶ One empty chamber in my gun ¶ ¶ There's no undo, the deeds are done ¶ ¶ It's a cruel, cruel world ¶ ¶ I stand alone ¶ ¶ In empty space ¶ ¶ No-one to hear me say my lines ¶ ¶ No-one to recognise my face ¶ ¶ It's a cruel, cruel world. ¶ Yeah, and third's straight down.

No. We both crossed the line today. You're seeing the world differently now. You're no better than me. You know that, don't you? I didn't bring you here kicking and screaming. You knew the fuckin' plan. You helped. I agree. You're worse than me. I know what I am. I don't lie to myself the way you do. In fact, if you weren't such a weak piece of piss... we could have been riding away on our bikes by now. Oh, I don't know about that. Yeah. Maybe you're right. You're left-handed, yeah? Yep. - It's not too late, Jeff. - Oh, Tez. I'm pretty sure this is the definition of too late, mate. Well, now we know where we stand. Oh, you... Uh! Arggh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Arggh! Oh, fuck! The keys! Fuck! Oh... Well done, mate. We've got to go, mate. Or we're both gonna be fucked. Hey, the... the horse guy will be here soon, mate. I don't know what the hell they were thinking... ...trying to put Freddie in a fuckin' float in the dark. Someone wasn't thinking straight, mate. Terry. I know how you feel, mate. Mate... you've bunged me arm up pretty bad. How about we just call it even Stevens, huh? Tez... Mate, I w... wouldn't try and hurt you on purpose, mate. Not unless... not unless I had a good reason. What are you doin'? Tez, what are you doin'? Oh, mate... So, what makes you the one who decides I should fuckin' die? 'Cause you're a heartless bastard, Jeff. And I'm fuckin' sick of it. Come on. Tez. For fuck's sake. Fuck, mate! Jesus, Tez! So, what, are you gonna... are you just gonna stand there and watch your big brother... fuckin' burn to death? Oh, Tez! Mate... We're not walking away from this. Fair enough. Fair enough, Terry. But I can't do it, mate. I can't do jail. I can't. If it ends, it ends now. The way we re... rehearsed. Like the Romans. Yeah. Like the Romans. We didn't rehearse that. But here. Knock yourself out. Oh, T... Oh! The Romans... Romans... Romans are full of shit, Terry! They're full of shit! It isn't... quick at all! It really hur... hurts, Terry. It's... You're a s... a s... You're a... You're a security guard. You're a s... You're a security guard. I... I... remembered. Hi. You alright? Oh, you're here for Freddie. - Excuse me? - Freddie, our horse. Yeah. Do you need me... to call someone? Yeah, no, that's, um... That's my brother. Sorry... have you ever owned a horse before? Yeah, I've... I've... I've had horses all my life. Oh, great. But he's... he's gonna be for my daughter. Oh, good. I got a couple of boys. Freddie's... he's really good with kids. Good. Sorry, you're not gonna... you're not gonna agist Freddie in a paddock and let him rot, are you? No. No, he'll... be looked after... well. Great. Freddie's actually very shy, so you should... you should tell your daughter he really likes to be rubbed on the nose. OK. A-and his back scratched as... as well. I-I'll just be a minute. Triple Zero emergency. Are you after police, fire or an ambulance? Yeah, um... Oh... All of them. I think. Can you tell me the town or suburb, please? Yep. Um, 41 Hastings-- We have already received a call from that location. Y-you have? How long ago? Uh, about 10 minutes ago. Are you OK? Come on, mate. Stay there, mate. Hey, do you want to... do you want to just take a seat for a bit? No, I'm fine. You don't need to do this. It's OK. He's a gift for your daughter. Can I... ask... What happened here? Oh...
