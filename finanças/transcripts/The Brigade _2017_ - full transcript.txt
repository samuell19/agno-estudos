- What's up? - It's weird. A lady thinks two fake firemen are collecting funds. Do I call the cops? No, it's those two assholes. Send Xavier. Who called? A neighbour, I think. We'll get them this time. ln Lille, guys pinched a truck. Shit, they're crazy. Where are they? There! Come here, you! Let go! Take this off. - Strip him! - Let go of me! Scamming old ladies? Lucky we don't set you on fire! Not even your size! Now piss off! Run and hide! lt stinks! Ok, ma'am? Who are the real firemen? We are. Save it for us at Christmas. Have a good day. - Look at this. - The jerks! Show me. We're the real firemen. THE BRIGADE Come in. Hello. Benedicte Meursault. Philippe. Have a seat. G reat CV . Glad to have you. May | ask why you transferred here? For my husband's job. My old station was closing. No closure here? There's talk on high. We can't do much, but the station is busy so... Any big fires? Afew. Meaning? A few, a lot, loads? Well, not many forest fires. But a lot of urban ones. And car crashes, loads. And... - Worked with women before? - Yes. I mean, in another station. Not here. Not since I got here. So, captain, we have a new captain? A lady one. Soon to be assistant chief. I won't say if she's hot as that's sexist. Ok, fine. But is she hot? Ok, douser. Your badge and pager. HR training? I like recruitment. And you? FSI. An arsonist hunter? We find out how a fire started. First names? If you want. Welcome, Benedicte. - Béné for short. - Ok, Béné. Your colleagues now. We're a man short. It'd be good to recruit one. Why don't I take the window? You can, but it'd be a pity. Here you go. Thanks, I'm Béné. You know dousers? A classic trick. That's done. Martial, show her the pool, sauna, suites, etc. Ok, let's go. The men's locker room. A bit of a mess... And this is the girls', brand-new. It's a bit basic, sorry. It's just for you. - Many volunteers? - 50%. - Where do you run? - Just outside. A real racehorse. Worn out? I did two laps before you got here. lt's when I push it... - Sure. - It hurts. You need two captains? As a veteran, you're my deputy. She's due for promotion. We'll leave her in charge now and then. Seb's good. Jules too, but he's green. - When is it? - Next month. If they train, they could win. Do the schedule? Heard about Moran? They want to merge us. If they move us, it's bad for our families. It's ok, we're the best. Sébastien, not nights. Martial is good. l have two absences tonight... Who can fill in? Me. We're good then. Xavier... Can you fill in with her tonight? But leave her in charge. Sure? Shejust got here. I know, but we have to start somewhere. You got my message? Yeah, I'm on duty. I want to be here a lot at first. Put Etienne on? Hiya, sweetheart. Cleaned your teeth? That's good. Good night, honey. Love you. - Ask if you can't. - It's ok. See? I can. Accident on the D118! Two cars, heavy damage. Call a doctor. What are Limoux doing? Sending an ambulance. Martial, the rear one with me. Guys, assess the victim's status! Martial, take the gear. Hurry it up! Can you hear me, ma'am? It's the fire brigade. Don't move. Are you ok, sir? We'll look after you. - What happened? - Don't worry. Let's sit down. Hold him. Sit down, sir. Sir, it's the fire brigade. Can you move? Keep still. Sir, can you... Get the neck-brace ready. l'll radio it in. BRAM 1, over. Road accident, 2 cars, 3 victims. Were you alone in the car? Go and check. Take my hand. It's gonna be fine. Remember the crash? Steady the car! It's the fire brigade. I'm coming in. Do you hear me? l'll hold your head... Use the blanket. We're using a blanket. To protect you. Be ready for some noise. Well? A male in shock. One DOA, one serious. Cover the body. I'll get the KED. Come back for the board. Get the neck brace on her first. - The KED. - Put it there. Here's the van. I'm with you. We'll get you warm. Move it, guys. Get the stretcher! I'll do the neck-brace. A neck-brace... To hold your head. Let me see. Don't move your head. Well? I'm holding her. One DOA, one casualty, drowsy, with multiple injuries. Take her in. Don't waste time. Ma'am, I'm putting you on an IV. Are you with us? We're losing her. The paddles! Charge them. 250. Clear! Again. Paddles charged to 300. Clear! Nothing. Nothing at all. It's over. It's over. How are you, sir? Violent local storms. Were your guys out? Yeah, a guy ran off the road. A bad one. Send me a full report. Ask your team and get back to me. Seen that? Tenth day in a row at34°C. Yeah, I've seen. With an east wind. That's bad. Just a sec... There was a problem last night. Call HQ. You've heard? We only know there's a problem. The police found a third victim on the scene. Ejected, 30 m away. - Alive? - In a coma. I don't get it. She didn't ask you to check? l was on the other car. We couldn't see in the rain. Never leave a scene without a sweep. That's a basic. We couldn't see a thing! Did she check everywhere? Yeah, I think so. - Yes or no? - Yes, I think so! I can't really say. l was with the victim. It was tense. Ok, I want a report. Frankly? - Yes. - l was on the second car. I ordered a sweep there. I don't know about the other. Maybe she didn't. Good evening. Room 10. l was in charge last night. How is he? He's stable. My husband was 30 metres away! 30 metres! The police found him! Where were you? Get out of here! I'm watching my husband die 'cause of you! I want the police report to see who was there exactly. You just walk off? Not answering my calls? l was at the hospital. - How is he? - Still in a coma. Ok, come on. Explain. It was dark and raining, but did you do a full sweep? I think so. I don't know. We were with the woman. I didn't go far enough. What's that? My resignation. It's your first screw-up. Keep your resignation. You'll have no choice if he dies. You'll shoot yourself in the foot. It means you feel guilty. - I do. - Don't you realize? No one's perfect. l have a winegrower with a worker in a tank knocked out by gas. Let's go. You'll stop... Herve, send Xavier along. Quick, here! - Where? - Here. I told him not to go in. Sir, can you hear me? Sir? Step back. I'm going in. Save him! The chief's going in. - Save him, he has two kids! - Calm down. We know what we're doing. The chief's going in. Stay here. Ok? Prepare the gear. The harness. He's alive! Drop the harness! Lift! Your anchor points? Here and here. Go on. Ready? 1, 2, 3, lift! Hoist him up! So screw him. Let him come begging. Ok, sweetheart? You smoke? That's new. ljust took a drag. What brings you? - Why didn't you call? - I did. My phone's had it. I can spend Wednesday with you. Happy? If you don't yell at me too much. - How's Mum? - Fine. Is she in? She's shopping. See you Wednesday. You smell weird. Been drinking? Yeah, a whole tank. Is it true a crash victim was forgotten? We're checking it out. There. Relax. Excuse me. We'll stop there. I'll see you next week. Lucie! Can you see Mr Marcellin? l have to go. - A fire? - Yes. The station. Jules, I promised it'd be ready tomorrow! Damn station... Go! Jules, your first big fire. Stick to Xavier and follow his lead. Keep him in sight. Lose focus and you've had it. If there's a problem, the truck protects you. Got that? Béné... Stay on the pump. The hose is heavy as a dead elephant. I love dead elephants. How's it going, sir? One man wounded. l withdrew the group. lt's spreading and threatening Montlaur. Handle that sector. Any scoopers? One's flying in from Corsica. Ok, I'm on it. I don't want any problems like that accident the other night. Leaving the truck. Get all the gear. Xavier! Béné! Equipment officer! Move it! Move, Béné! The wind's blowing it to Montlaur. lt mustn't cross the road. Xavier, go in with hoses from the three pumpers. Béné, it's your first fire, so stay in sight. Any questions? Ok, let's go! Attack! An extension. Not right away. Roll it out! Turn it on! Go ahead! That ok? Advance! Go on, Béné! More slack? Give us more slack! Good pressure. To your right! Prep the extensions! l'm advancing. l'm behind you. Move fonNard, guys! Do the base! Give me more slack! Clear the hoses! Xavier, it's leaping to your left! To your left! lt's catching! Pull back! Pull back! Shit, this looks bad. Pull back! Béné, attack the base. I'm doing that. To your right! I can't advance! Hold on... Give us more slack! - Ok? - Not enough! I need more! Fuck! The pressure's going! Kevin, hear me? Kevin, more pressure! - What's the flow? - 250! Jules! Take over! Go on, Seb. Give me more slack! Where's the scooper? The wind could trap us. l'll radio when I know. Kevin. Give us the rest. Papa Charlie to Chamack. lt's spreading over the plain. Pelican arrival imminent. Ok, I see it. Copy. Pelican in sight. Pull back! Scooper! I can't hear! Get orders from the truck. Pull back, come in! Water dump! Béné! Water dump! What? I can't hear! Fuck! Run! Come on, run! How much burned? 130 hectares. That's not the worst. Mirepoix lost a truck, one casualty. Shit. See how Béné leapt under the truck? I couldn't hear. That's two dousings already. Jules, great work. I thought my ass was fried. Your ass, not your dick. Great weekend you'd have with a fried dick. Just letting off steam. Weird how guys let off steam from the same tiny hose. Why tiny? The investigator is Billet. Know him? Yes, I do. We're counting on you. If some jerk's setting fires, it'll be bad. Gentlemen, dear friends... Excuse me, I wanted to say that my village is proud of you. I've had a meal prepared with good wine and a great goat's cheese I make. Mr Mayor... I'll see you later. Goat's cheese, chief? Pass the orange juice. - We're going to Biquet's? - You bet. I'll see you there. And this one... Pretty low... I want darts with feathers, not this Chinese shit! I'm glad that's over. You're in good spirits. l have a sweet tooth. You run fast anyway. A big fire? Only normal, it's so dry. Scrubland burns fast. We have to be quick, light, reactive. - You did good. - Thanks. So, the scrubland... Any ideas yet? It began far from the road. The tarmac burned last. We'll have to see. That'll be a lot of work. - School tomorrow. - Same here. - How much? - Leave it. Thanks. See you. See you tomorrow. Shit... I never know if you were banging a chick, boozing with the guys or playing the hero. Both, captain. I played the hero, then I boozed with the guys. And now the chick? Well, if possible... It's not possible. | start at 7 am. You're driving her to school. A bad one? Fuck... 130 hectares. - Casualties? - One. Not with us, only light. Good. No. Ok... All right... What do we feel like? Tomorrow. Tomorrow instead. The launch window for a baby is tonight. Ok, go on. Martial? It works best with you on top. The handbook says so. Yeah, sure... Want some light? l'll manage. l'll manage. - lt's Philippe. Did I wake you? - No. Afterl do the fire assessment, we can meet at Montlaur town hall. Is that ok? Good night. Seen the time? I'm done. Stop now. I'll do that tomorrow. No, you won't. So? We both work. Stop obsessing. I've finished now. The silence always gets me. Not a bird, no leaves on the trees, not a fucking sound. The prefect's terrified it'll happen again. The wind was gusting at 40 kmph. From the north-west, before veering southerly. If it began somewhere, it was here. A cigarette tossed from a car... I don't buy it. What is it? It began far from the village. Maybe the wind was supposed to blow it that way. From the hillside there, he had a ringside view. I like it. You think like an arsonist. | order clearing annually. This is it. It could be a villager. Or anyone. Even firemen start fires. Is there CCTV of the town hall? 876 inhabitants? No... My house burned too. I wanted to sell, but with the insurance, no hope. The phones... And the land register. Good work. Whose house was this? lt's marked there. That one's the mayor's. True, not easy to sell. Ok. Found a new recruit? I'm seeing him tomorrow. Join us at the pizza place. Come on in! Want to eat something? No, I'm ok. What's up? Done your report on that accident? Yeah, but I haven't sent it in. Can I read it? Got a computer? Of course. Sit down. With this shit, she could get the station closed. So we write it. As a volunteer fireman, what would you like to do? Everything. Fires, mainly. I'll do anything, but I like physical work. Do you plan to turn professional? Why not? The pay's not great, but who cares? You don't? Well, I do. But it's not the main thing. Still need me? List your flaws and your qualities. To see what I can do when it's tough? That's the idea. For you... what's the hardest thing about the job? Wouldn't you rather hear the good things? We're useful, it's not routine... - That's not bad, right? - It's great. We'll stop there. Anything you'd like to add? Any personal remarks? I'm gay. Yes, I'm homosexual. l hesitated about applying, but you need volunteers. - You'll add that? - No, it's your business. - Finished? - Yes. Henri, right? Can I go? Ok. Got a change of clothes? No. Why? No reason. The board! Go on, jump! Pull up now! Bravo! - What is it? - They want us at Les Liseraies. Join us with the ambulance. Isn't that where they stoned you? I knocked. I can always count on her if I need her. She drives to work but her car hasn't moved for a week. A week? No music for two days now. She plays it loud. Did she mention going away? On Sunday, we talked about her wedding. - Can you open it? - No, break in. Don't stay here. Step aside. Anyone here? Miss! Cut the rope. We shouldn't touch. Cut the rope, ok. Let's get the stretcher. We should have left her. The police cut them down. What'll you do? A report? You're good at them. Needling me? You're needling me? You're needling me? You're pissing me off! lt's Jules' first hanging. Shut the fuck up. A girl too... Fuck... Track and obstacle course. Let's go! You heard him? Sweat out the toxins. We'll rest tomorrow. Aren't you warmed up by 11? Did you know that suicide? I grew up there. Fire, rivers in flood, you give it all you've got and... you're beat, but you forget. What? Nothing. It's good to see you like that. It is. You cross the line, you snap. Join the club. Do I cry, is that it? No. But I cry. I can teach you if you want. We're off tomorrow. We need it. Like these? Yeah, except for the holes... They suck without the holes. They do? - How much? - That's the price. Wow, pretty expensive holes. Can I have these in a 7, please? I'll get them. Mum told me about the hearing. It's a drag. They called me a slut for wearing a skirt! Knocking over a scooter isn't... I barely touched them. They fell on purpose. Got any witnesses? Diane and Armelle. But they're too scared of those scumbags to talk. Fear isn't always a bad thing. It keeps you safe. So I get called a slut? If you're called an asshole, then what? Then you're using a lot of bad words. Let's move it. You drive. Who's their chief? Lauzier. Why did you come? Three stations are already on it. A pro can volunteer. Jules, let's go! With me! - Big? - No, they want us as backup. Lauzier to Chamack. Yes, chief. We 've got it under control. We don't need you now. Xavier, they don't need us. - Sure? - They say so. We turn back when we can. Ok, copy. You didn't go? - Coitus interruptus. That's the word? - If a guy droops. Latin turns me on. Another dud! l have to do an assessment. Coming, Béné? Jules... Throw the ball in. Good news. Your crash victim's out of his coma. Have you been contacted? No. Why? HQ didn't call you? The bad news is he's pressing charges. Or his wife is. Same thing. For culpable negligence? Exactly. Negligence is our speciality, of course. What next? An internal inquiry, with colleagues testifying and so on. It'll be hell to live through. My husband wants me to quit. Lauzier to Chamack. Go ahead. Where are you? On my way. You've heard about the charges? HQ called me. Ok. What do you think? Your captain, Meursault... What's she like? Chamack? You copy? I copy. I'm with her right now. Ah... Right... We're pulling out. Look around and call me. Copy. What do you think? The wind was south-south-east, then turned. The same arsonist as at Montlaur? Maybe, but I don't think so. What is it? Only one side's burned. It came from the road below. Some jerk tossing a cigarette. 50 metres higher, it would have been deliberate. No great difference, see. 20 metres more, you saw that guy. And I can screw up over 50 metres. My dad cleared land. I can still smell the smoke on him. I'll ask the big question. Why did you join up? It's simple, I guess. A chubby girl's dream. She wanted to prove her worth. When you do harm, it stirs you up. The guy's alive. Forgive yourself. What's that song? An old US groupl love. Nice and long! I'm alone here! - A domestic. - What is it? No idea. Their French isn't great. Hello, ma'am. What's wrong? Upstairs? Let's go up. Come! Hello, ma'am. Show me. All right. Martial? When was the due date? Henri, get the multi-pack. It's ok. Have the waters broken? Do you understand? We're here now. The due date? You understand? You speak French? It's no use. Do you understand "due date"? Is it her first baby? This is tough. I don't understand. Let's take her in. Bretonno 209, arrival in 10 minutes. Way too long. VVhy? I can see the head! So do the necessary! It'll be ok. Lift your legs. Take deep breaths. With each contraction, breathe, block and push. Ok? Breathe. Block. Push! That's good! Don't stop now! A bit more! It's coming. You're doing well. Everything's fine. One more time. Breathe, block, push. Do it with me! Watching the road? Push hard! Keep pushing! A bit more! Here he is! He's here! Great work! It's a boy. Bravo, ma'am! It'll be ok now. Victory! Fuck... - What? - Another. There's two! I don't believe it! Can't she hold on? We're nearly there. Take him, Henri. We're taking him. It's to help the second one. We've done one, we can do another now. Mind the cord. Let's go. Take in all the air you can. Here we go. Block and push. Jules! Shit! The mother sent photos from the maternity ward. They're both beautiful. Check the look... She couldn't speak a word of French. The second freaked us out... You scored a double? Let me see. Excellent! Cute. Is that the boy? No, the girl. Coumbo. No, Coumba. She's Coumba. The boy's Madibo. l'm Coumba's godfather. Henri is Madibo's. Henri did great, the cords and all... Right? Never been a godfather before. You, chief? In real life, not on thejob. You women have it tough. She suffered. I never want to be pregnant. Once you hold the baby, you forget. Ok, guys, there's work to do. We have a van to clean. Listen, | read your report. It's a bit harsh. - I don't think so. - I do. Got a problem? Tell me, got a problem? No. Yes, I do. The guys say the station could be closed. My wife's frantic. Béné screwed up, ok. Ok, baby? What's up? An accident on the A61 feeder. I heard. You were on it? A truck and a car. In the car, the driver was dead. But... But what? Come here. There was a 5-year-old girl. It took an hour to get her out. An hour... You had the claw? No, Benoit and Sylvain. I talked to her. She was breathing. But, after a while, she stopped breathing. She kept looking at me. When we got her out, I held her. Her little legs were all... all broken. I put her in the bag... And then... And that was it. Sorry. I didn't mean to. Sorry. How was your day? Good. It was good. It went well. It's me! Eﬁenne? - Ok? - Where's Etienne? He's sleeping at Romeo's. Why didn't you call me? I can handle it. Can you? Interior Ministry. Shit, your job's a fucking drag. Why isn't Etienne here? I never know when you're home. A night at a pal's gives me a break. I'd like to see him. That's about the guy you missed? Yeah, I missed him. Shit, a court order now! They don't realize! 10 years of shit! We moved three times for your job. But that's ok. Right... We move, but I have a normal job! A normal woman does a normal job. You loved your fiancee being different. Even Etienne's had enough now. He isn't here. As | start at 6, I'll sleep at the station. For a break! Béné! Laurent, I'm watching the video you sent. Nothing conclusive. I'm on the service station and... Nothing conclusive. That's it, man. Bye. What's up? You're on duty? l'll sleep here to be ready tomorrow. You're hooked. My ex-wife said that. With no one to save, I'm lost. Tragedy is our drug. I've heard that one. Good night. Max, I'm leaving the switchboard. Can you take over? Who's that? The chief. He's not bad. Cute. Where's his hose? Work-out over, ladies. Goodbye. Get up... - It's over? - Yeah. Your chief's no fun. Great. Thanks, guys. Great firemen... That's put my fire out! We'll do the gendarmes next time. They're more fun. Bye, girls. Sorry. Next time you're in heat, forget us. Thomas, show them out and lock up. They go for the uniform. Yeah, right. Good night. Run, the contest's in two weeks. An orgy in the station now... Two broads hot for the uniform make an orgy? That sucks. What sucks is babies dying from bad heating, old people no one cares about. That sucks. Fucking will never suck. You chew me out for a fuck, but I never left a casualty in a ditch. - What is it? - A car on fire in Floure. A terrorist attack? The cops shot a guy. The projects are a tinderbox. Dispatched. Keep a back-up team here. Got it. - Reinforcements? - They'll be on their way. It was the same three years ago. Kids have no limits now. Without a job and a future, some of them screw up. - Did you? - Me? How? Bad stuff. | just couldn't sit in a class and listen. You wanted to be a fireman? Like a lot of kids. Fire interested me. Not girls? Same difference. Well? What's going on? Any news? We're on hold for now. They called about the inquiry. Yeah, they called me too. And I'll tell the truth. You're saying I won't? No idea what you'll say. But it's the whole truth for me. What's the truth? I don't know if you did a full sweep. That's the truth. The truth is you hate a woman in charge. Or a "chick", maybe? Bus on fire! - Where? - Les Liseraies. Fuck! Ok, guys, this is a real hotspot. Security comes first. Let the cops handle any provocation. We protect each other. We watch our backs, ok? It's hell! We'll protect you as best we can! Ok, copy. Last year, they threw metal balls from the 6th floor. So watch out. Xavier, Thomas, the hydrant. Béné, Martial, foam. Eric, cover them. l'll coordinate. We put it out fast and split. We're on site. Bus on fire, no casualties, we're putting it out. Get back to the truck! Ok, finish up! The foam and then we split. Watch it, they're wild! Hey, it's a chick! Bitch! Stay home with your kids! Let's head back! Abandon the hoses! Pull out! Fuck off, you bastards! Everyone ok? Omelette all round? Foam on the fire, not the guys around. I know, but Thomas fell and they were too close. The can that hit me... There was something heavy in it. Kind of wild. Spit it out, Thomas. It was violent. lt freaked me out. Some great people live there. But a dozen jerks get the attention. Shit, we're there to help and they spit on us. It's really tough. Our job is to put fires out everywhere. We have no choice. You can't say, "No, not there, it's too dangerous." It's more the cops' job. The cops were there. We split, but they stayed. Like that crash. We split and the cops came after. Good job too. What is it? You enjoy winding me up until I get mad, is that it? Know what? In 20 years, in three stations, it's my first inquiry. Hear that? The first! If we shut down, we'll know why. That's bullshit! - Closures depend on local budgets. - Sure! Everything goes into the balance, including an inquiry! An inquiry means a culprit. A female one. If I was a guy, I swear... Go on, I'd enjoy that. Trouble is, you're not a guy. She isn't. But I am. - Good night. - Thanks. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Bye, Etienne. Everything ok? You slept well? - Were you on a fire? - A bit. Dad says you'll stop. We need people to put out fires. Killer smile? Lovely clean teeth! You're so handsome. Can I sleep in your bed? Ok, Henri. Find your rhythm, rung by rung. Nice and proud. Look up. Ok, that's not bad. A crossover now. Show him. Henri, to the left! Xavier, suck in your gut! Keep climbing, Xavier! Steady, ok. Don't rush it. Xavier! Come down! Jesus... Something for you! Recognize this? The shit never ends. What did I find in it? Condoms! Come and get it. Come down, asshole! You find it funny? You're heroes and we're shit, is that it? It's easy for you. Girls love it. You save kids, you're heroes, saviours... When can we complain? When? Well I'm doing it now. Come and get your things. Come down! If you don't come down, I swear... I'm so damn sick of it... Chief, HQ calling! We 've found the ﬁre-starter. A jerk who tossed a cigarette? We have his plate. The cops'/l pick him up. Come in. Here she is. Sit here. The commander wants a word. Sir. Because of the charges, I had to launch an inquiry. If you did nothing wrong, you're ok. Did you? I didn't do a wide enough sweep. No one will leave a scene now without doing a full sweep. If it helps... It will help. Philippe... Any progress on Montlaur? - I'm on it. - Not good enough. Was it deliberate or an accident? I need to know. Right. Call me back. Montlaur's bothering me. I spotted a kid. I asked around. He was adopted. His dad's the mayor. What's making you hesitate? It's a village, see. I can't afford to be wrong. What if it's him? As a minor, it'll follow him all his life. Talk to the kid. Sound him out. lt's risky. Normally, I can't talk to witnesses. Normally. But is this job normal? Béné, someone for you. Coming. "Béné, someone for you." I bet he's a fag. Maybe, but he didn't choose. You're dumb and I'm handsome. That's how it goes. Not as dumb as you're handsome. Debatable. I saw you. At the crash, I saw you. I saw you from behind the bushes. You even looked my way. I tried to cry out, but I couldn't. l'm dropping the charges. I'm doing it because the real culprit is dead. My brother-in-law was driving. The jerk. 2.8 g of alcohol in his blood. l was a jerk to ride with him. Have a good day. Thank you for coming. Xavier. A new alert. Domestic. No one answering. Water damage. Just round the corner. Béné! Martial! It's that door there. I heard a racket. I don't know who it was. Ok, thank you. Open up, fire brigade! Anyone there? It's the fire brigade! Get the crowbar. See if we can get in below. Carry on. Can we reach the apartment from your balcony? Impossible. - We can't cross? - Impossible. Did you hear shouts? Not today, but they yell a lot. We'll break the door down! What's going on, sir? What's going on? What's going on here? Do you hear me? Béné, come out! Don't stay alone! Open up! Open the door! Sir, where's your wife? Tell me where she is. Open up! I can handle it! Sir, tell me where your wife is. Are you ok? Ma'am... Can you hear me? It's the fire brigade. Grip my hands if you hear me. Very good. I'm here, it'll be all right. Béné! Come down, it's urgent, one casualty! I'm downstairs! I'm with you now, ma'am. I'm not moving. There. That's good. For your blood pressure. Stretcher. Go with him. Stay with me. If you hear me, grip my hand. That's good. We're going to the hospital. I'll be with you. Don't move. Calm down. I'll take it off... Breathe calmly. I'm here with you. There. Check her pressure. Just breathe calmly. I'll be with you till we get there. It's nearly over. Her husband? Martial? Where's the husband? The police have him. Don't worry, I'm with you. We're there now. 90/70, pulse 53. Bruising on the right temple, possible internal bleeding. Barely conscious. We'll take over. The crash casualty came to see me. I was close, looked his way, but didn't see him. And? He's dropped the charges. I'm happy for you. Yeah? Yeah. I've asked for a transfer. You were right. Working under a chick's orders isn't my thing. It pisses me off. It's not natural. When something happens, I'm scared for you. Crazy, isn't it? Must be some reptilian reflex to protect the female... Know what? It busts my balls... But you did a really great job today. Don't get up. Sit down, I said. Got a cigarette? Got a light? I quit ages ago. Apart from weed now and then. Do you smoke weed? I don't believe you. My daughter smokes a lot. I saw you with your dad. It wasn't easy with my old man either. So I really screwed up. There was an empty house near school. We smashed all the windows. Only natural. One day, I went alone. I wanted to see it on fire. It excited me. I crossed the garden, climbed in through a window and started a fire. It didn't catch right away. So I left, disappointed. There was smoke. Then flames. It was pretty good. Then I realized I'd screwed up. It would spread, kill people... I'd go to jail. I was wrecking my life. I tried to put it out. But all I did was scare myself. And get burned. Wait. Fire looks beautiful from afar. But close up it's hell. It bites your flesh. Your skin melts, comes away like wallpaper. The heat sears your lungs. Your pupils dilate. You feel the heat's entering your skull... Don't move. Help me. There's still a bit there. Let's go before the brigade arrives. Course 1. Course 2. Ready! Go for it! Go, champ! Let go of it! Keep going! Any small change for the station? Show us your ass! Lower! Don't waste time! You're a real woman now! Xavier won this 10 years ago? Almost. He came second. He did a lot back then. Go for it! He's not the worst. Mum was the same. She wanted to make him happy, but he can only be happy at the station. You used to rule at this. If I try again... I could still do it. - You do this every day? - Not every day. How's business? It's the recession. If Thomas wins, we'll make a killing. The dog had huge claws. She tried to climb on me as I swam and tore my back. When I took off my T-shirt, my girlfriend saw and asked how! got scratched. So I told her, "A bitch did it." I should've kept quiet. She blew her top. And I made it worse, saying I meant a real bitch... Back in the day, we saved cats. One day, a grannie turned up. Her cat was stuck on the roof, too scared to come down. The grannie turns up with a grannie dress and says, "Wear it, it's mine. Timmy will recognize you and come down." You did it? Of course I did. Up a ladder, dressed as a grannie. Rikou even took a photo! I still have it! And the cat? The jerk refused to move. I guess he recognized me. The beard. Ok, Béné... I'll be leaving soon but I'd like you to do something for me first. Ok, I'd like you to... I'd like you... to tell a dirty joke! Don't know any. A dirty joke! Dirty joke, dirty joke! I don't know any. Well, a really sick one. No, enough dirty jokes... Unless it's really sick. It's not that sick, ok... This married couple makes love and then the husband asks his wife, "Why don't you tell me when you come?" She replies, "You're never there." Sounds familiar, huh? Chief, your song. Shit... Come on! Big fire in Lézignan! - Urban? - But near the forest. - Source? - Unconfirmed. Apparently, a suicide bomber in a factory. Why the smile? I'm not smiling. Chief, don't take it badly, but it's really beautiful. Yes, it's beautiful. From afar. Subtitles by Ian Burley Subtitling: HIVENTY
