This is the most tragic moment in my life. There are two persons I love with all my heart. To night. One will kill me. Uncle Yin-yang. The other one will never see me again. Later you'll meet your dad. I am gonna come back in a moment. I come here today to say goodbye. The man of Yin and Yang. Evacuated all the peaple. He said this is your business. Everyone must leave. All of them. Don't misunderstand. Master Chang. I come to invite you to keep assisting Miss Yingji to finish the Tattoo. Dad. Lan. Lan. I come to help your father. There are so many enemies out there scheming to kill your father. People are so jealous and greedy. INVISIBLE TATTOO Chang is still live. The Japanese went to his house. The Man of Yin and Yang did not kill him to death. He was saved by that Japanese. He is the spy. Did you find Chang? I went to and the Three-in-One Club and salt Factory, but he's not there. You guys, follow me, this way. - Did you find him? - No. Once you find him, kill him at once. Let;s go to another place. Welcome! I want to talk to Director Luo. He is not here. It's urgent . Without his permission, no one is allowed to get in. Someone is there. - Be quite. - Check it out. This is Director's home, no one can break in. Where is the Director? He went to the village to solve some troubles. Get him back here. Tell him there's something urgent. Don't let others know that I am here, or your director will be in a great danger. Yes, sir. Don't let anyone in. I have to talk to Chilong, in person. Friend, well... you ask others to take him here. But the situation now brings no help to persuade him. I have to try another way. I don't know why Asano came here that day. Don't misunderstand. I just... I don't understand. There are a few guys outside your yard and at the gate of the Weak Dragon's house. Where are they? Yin-yang said only him and me can stay here, so Song took the rest of them. But we did not expect that Asano would come a second after they left. Director. Everyone of the Department has arrived. Okay. Chang. I have to leave. You two stay here. Don't go out. My place is very safe. I will take these two letters to Chilong for you. You keep the letter for Chilong. I keep the letter for Yin-yang. No problem. My name is Chang. The two standing behind me are my bros. The Man of Yin and Yang and the Weak Dragon The Man of Yin and Yang He name is Yin Changshi. He always dreams of flying. He loves shooting into the sky very much. And he enjoys the moment most when the bullet flies into the target peaple. He is always well prepared to welcome the bullet into his body. He is not dead. Due to his bravery, he become the Man of Yin and Yang. The other fat guy who always messes around names Wang Delong. He is two-meter hight, fat like a big meat ball. But he acts like a kid. It hurts! I should have made a small one. It hurts! Such a huge dragon can only be painted on your meat! I hate you! Come on. Don't rub it. Don't. Don't touch me! Stop it. It hurts! Dad. Grandma blacked out. Go back home! Go! Go! Mom. Hold on. Mom. Don't. Hold on, mom. I take you to the hospital. No... What a pity for the tattooed Dragon. The Great Dragon become the Weak one because it is infected. He is my neighborhood. I witnessed how he grew up. He lover his mother and son. All he dreams of is to become rich overnight. Open it. I won. What? What are you doing? Hey! You cheated. What are you doing? How dare you cheat? Screw you. Catch him. Screw you. Boss. Scratch my forehead. It tickles. Thanks. Bastard. If I had a gun, I would have shoot you right now. It's a big deal now. Shut up. Look. Give me the gun. Hey, dude. What about using your gun to shoot him? Well. no one gives me the gun. Okay. I'll take it myself. Freeze. Come on. Shoot if you dare. Wait a sec. I want to think for a moment You two should die first. Why? If I was him, that idiot, I should shoot you two to death when I have them under control. Then, I have them easyly, don't I? Um... Why don't you do some brain works? Why are you crying? I am thirsty. Stop talking. Don't move. Don't move. Don't. Everyone freeze. Or you will all get blood in your hands. It is said that better to end in peace with enmities rather than in hostility. Let's stop here. We should make friends with each other. Thanks, Master Chang. See you again. See you again. Let's go. Chang. Tell me who asked you to shoot. I don't think you want to see any blood. So I want to do it cleanly for you. Cleanly. Do somehing cleanly for me means no killing, and no blood. These peaple, they must regard me as a liar. It's my fault. It is an unforgiveble fault. Chang. I should show you how to shoot. You guys ask Chang to pay his debt. Find him. You guys ask Chang to pay his debt. You guys ask Chang to pay his debt. Well. This is my daughter. In the past, she never called me dad. She took me as her biggest enemy. I can't see anything because of you. Come on. You can't beat me. You can't do that. This boy underestimates Lan. His forgets that Lan still has one triumph card. Oh no. She is not my daughter. It's true. You can't run away. She is your daughter. Does it hurt so much? Chang. Your girl hit my son's head. You extended no damn care about it but scared him. Look what your daughter had done. You can beat him, but... but you can't beat his... How to do it? There is only one bottle left. Pay it. Mom. Dad. Here. I can't pee. Listen, what should I do to this? Well, strictly speaking, what has happened today, is all because of me. Lan's mother named Pearl, is the daughter of a witch living in the mountain and a Scotch adventurer. Not long after she married to me, I killed Chilong's biggest enemy. To hide from arresting, we lived a vagrant life almost traveling through China. Years after, I came back home finally. Lan, this is your father. Say dad. You are here, uncle Long. Uncle Long. Hey! Come here. Give me a hug. Here's your gift. Do you like it? I like it. Look. Chang is back, too. Are you happy? ﻿Boss Long. Chilong. He is the boss of a gang named Black Dragon Society, the biggest salt selling organization In other words, for most local residents, he is the real governor here. Bone carving, a mysterious rite settled during the period of its foundation, means to cut the muscle to carve a pattern of dragon on the bone, like Guan Yu cut his to get him detoxified. This rite is carried out with the help of anesthetic. Only those who are core members can have the chance to go through it. Fulfilled Dragon. Good job. From a Fulfilled Dragon to a Hidden Dragon, do you know the meaning behind it? Please enlighten me. It means you are bound to be a dragon, and it is your destiny. Copy that. Boss Long. Who are you? Where is Lee Mingfa? He's in the car. Let him out. Lee Mingfa! Come on! Turn the main lights off! Ask somebody to come here to move the boxes. Who unlocked it? ﻿Weak-Dragon? Let's go. What... what's the matter? I have never regretted to do this mission, but no one can deny the truth that everything became a great mess since the robbery at that ship. Director. I came here for this ship. Well, sorry, may I have your name? Asano. Mr. Asano, I am sorry. We don't know what have happened here. There is no evidence. The ship was burned out. And that car comes from somewhere else. How dare you rob the ship of the Japanese Empire. Director Luo, you think Black Dragon Society did it, right? As I know, Black Dragon Society is a salt selling organization at Dragon Rock Village. There is no organization who is so bold like them. Zhang Datian. Did you find anything? Director. I heard that a cart passed by there last night. It means, this case is not related to Dragon Rock at all. It seems so. Fine. Mr. Asano, as you can see, here is in my charge. There is none of my business. Let's go. Yes, sir. Director Luo. We will meet again. Stop looking. Stop it, stop, stop looking. What are you looking at? Look at you. What, what are you doing? Run. Dear how are you? Did these boys hurt you? Come here, I'll help you. - You are not Chang's daughter? - No. Are you sure? Have a look. Do you like sugar? This is distinctive. Just eat. Xi Xianghong, I named her. She is starring performer of American Universal Circus. She travels the world with the team. Every time she went to a new place, she would find the best local tattooist. And she would become their lover once she feels good. I'm looking forward Chang. Are you available? Chang. Boss Long wants to see tou. Shit. An incredible woman. A Bohemian fairy. Asano, came for no good. He came here for Black Dragon Society. We should be more careful. Kill him. Discreetly do it and no one would notice it. And he would never know what he dies for. Then we throw his body into the river. No one would know where he lost his life. Where is it? Guess, in which hand. Chang, Chang, Chang. Here it is. A nice choice. How much is it worth? It is priceless. What about selling it? We find the seller, and each shares the haft of the money. I am not a guy like you. Why did I not leave you alone that day... Why? You are a man of mercy. You took care of me. A merciful friend? Take care of you? A bastard like you don't deserve my helps. I am a bastard. You know me for a long time. You are such a greedy man. I make money merely for my mother and son. Buy a good place to bury my mom. Listen, First, the jade must be sold to someone living somewhere far away, as far as possible. Second. Never gamble again. Well... You have to! Before we find any buyers, you should keep the jade from others. Never tell your mother about it. Okay. Then see you later, Chang. Okay. Jerk! Why do you hit his head again? You cause troubles to me everyday with your catapult. You want any beat? Where's the catapult? Give it to me. No way. Give my catapult to me. I want my catapult. I hate you. Stop. Where's the money from? You stole it? No, I didn't do it. Uncle Long gave me the money. ﻿Boss Long. Don't take it from me. He is a devil! He threw away my catapult and money. He will go to hell! - Your words! What rae you talking about? - I said he is a devil! He is your dad. He is not my dad. He killed my mom. He's not! It you! - You killed my mom. - Lan, Lan. You did it. You let her die. You are the killer. You did it. Look carefully. That is fantastic! Thumb off the gun's safety catch. Aim it. Listen! I don't buy it. Got any problem with that? No. Of course not. Should I hit you or not? Yes, you should. I want my money back. I want my money back. What money? Oh, it's your money. Do I own you any money? Boss Long gave the money to me. Then you should go and ask him for it. You should give me the money. Or I'll tell Boss Long. Go ahead! Don't be angry. Run! Lan! Don't run away. A couple of bitches. Idiot! Chang. Good for you. Why didn't you get hurt? I didn't sleep in the bed. Chang. From the clothes they have and that guy's, it seems they're accomplices. It's all your fault! Hey. We're talking about you. Lan told me later. When she's sleepng at the Club in the afternoon, she heard some people from the mountain talking about killing me. She was going to tell me. But she changed her mind after seeing me and Xianghong making out. I'll miss you. This foreigner is called Mike. He is Xianghong's boss. He is here to to pick her up. You are really annoying. Baby. Let's go. Chang. Bye bye, sweetheart That silly girl thinks that her mother died because of me. Who's her mother? My wife. How could I hurt my wife? Are you saying that she is not your child? DDon't come back once you're away from here! On that day, after we stopped quarreling, she looked pale. I thought she was mad at me. I was just staing here for drinking. I planned to talk to her after she wasn't angry. I never thought she would... Mom. Mom, what's the matter? Mom, are you okay? At such an age, she should suddenly be ill like this. And within few days, she passed away. Chang. Having a heart disease, she shouldn't get angry. Wait for me. Chang. Knife! Watch out! Turn back! Uncle Yin-yang. Piss of. Lan. Lan. Lan. He's holding a knife. This is your father. Call him father. They pooped on my pants. Just go inside. Why are you standing here? ﻿Bros, I'm going to start a new life. I'll bring my daughter with me, and live my life. Are you Master Chang? What's your name? I am... Asano. We didn't met before. What I can do for you? You're the fifth generation of Kylin Tattoo School, aren't you? I heard that you're the most excellent tatooist among the southwest region. Master Chang, don't get me wrong. I just want to show you this. This is Master Iguchi's work, who is from Ikutha. What a masterpiece! I wondering whether you can tatoo a black dragon on my body? But. If you don't mind my saying so, you're got a fish on your body. If you want to add a dragon, then you'll get them mixed together. That's inauspicious. Get fish and dragon mixed together? This is exactly what I want. To let the Japanese fish meet with Chinese dragon. To get them mixed together. For me, this is the perfect state. I want black dragon on the chest. Okay. Please follow me. Have a seat, please. Kid, what's your name? It's time for bed. What happened to your head? It's time for bed. You scared her. Master Chang. Yout tools are in that box? There are treasures in it. Come on. Have a look. It seems that today is not the day. I'll be back in a few days. On his back, it's Kijaku Killing the Evil Carp. It seems that he's not only going to kill the fish, but also kill the dragon. Japanese led by Asano are in Sichuan. Asano is a spy from Japan Special Tech. He has a complicated background. Now we have the order that, police stations nationwide small not content with this man. Since the Sino-Japan relationship is complicated, and delicate now, please assure his safety. The provincial police station just released the documant. Did you see Li Shiqun on it? Yes. He's with Wang Jingwei. Even my boss with have to listen to him. Lucky him! Well. If you arrived here two seconds later, you could only see his body. Well, only two seconds. Master Chang, they're preparing the meat. Food will be served once Doctor Fei comes. Doctor Fei treated Lan. His medical skill is excellent. And he treated her for free. In return, I was going to treat him in Juxian Restaurant. Are you Doctor Fei? Yes, I am. May I help you? Doctor Fei was murdered on the way to see me. I become the suspect since that day. Master Chang, I came to your home just now. The second time Asano came to see me, banker Han Qichang was assassinated, too. This is Miss Eiki. Nice to meet you, Master Chang. You said this matter has nothing to do with you. People died when you see him. It happens twice. How can you say it has nothing to do with you? Stop acting like it's none of your business. Show me some evidence to prove you're innocent. I'm talking to you. Are you listening? Shaojun! What're you doing? Put the gun down. Just let him get out. He's out of line. Excuse me? Get out! Chang. Don't stoop to the same level as him. I apologize for that. I'm fine. Next time Asano comes here, I'll kill him. You should definitely not kill him. Then what should I do? Why should I hold the bag? I know how you feel. But I also know that you have a long-term vision. You won't make trouble to Black Dragon Society, will you? For finfing the truth, I ask Yin-yang to investigate secretly the treasure receiver on that boat. Much to our surprise. he should be a police who has been transferred for ages. He's Jiang Yuemin. Bravo! Are you nuts? Listen. Do you have any other word to say? Chang. Don't be mad. She's loving this so much. She insists to wear it. I just can't stop her. You wouldn't have to stop her if you didn't tell her. Haven't I told you before not to tell her? If something happened, you should take the consequences. Alright. I gotta go now. Hey, mom. I'm right here. I have a bad feeling that Asano's planning something bigger. We must get rid of him as soon as possible. Chang. I know what you mean. But for this, we need the permission from Boss Long. Wow. Let me have a look of your jade. Master Chang. This is valuable. Mother, it's cold outside. Come in first. I'm not feeling cold. - I'm seeing them off. - You should go first. Take care. Wish you a long life! It seems that I come here not at a right time. Master Chang, this time, I want you to tattoo a black dragon here, just like them. Don't move. Everyone is drunk today. We don't have any choice. Just go. Okay. Well, I'd better go now. Hey, Japs. isn't she mine now? You can have her if you like. How about you? Master Chang. Release her. Japs is a rude word ﻿Weak Long. Master Chang, I'll come to see you tomorrow. You missed the best chance just now. He can't die in Black Dragon Society's place. What if he starts first? He won't. I hope that he can start first. On the second day, for sake of not seeing Asano again, I brought Lan to the suburb. The tail breaks not at where the knife cuts it. Right. It cuts its tail for saving itself. If we meet something dangerous later, we need to cut something off for saving ourselves Don't be too loath to part with it. Just cut it off. Just leave my slingshot to me. You can't catch me. Stop runing! I'm here. Still running? I'm going to catch you. You can't catch me. Here are you. You can't catch me. What a strategy for escaping. Lan, don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Lan. You're so great. How could you be scared of that Japanese? Who told you I'm scared? Didn't you say that you can't offend him, but you can hide from him? That is because you can't use gun? I can use it. Uncle Yin-yang taught me. Guns are too cold. I don't like things without emotion. What do you mean? You'll figure it out later. Master Chang, open the door. I know that you are inside. Open the door. Bastard. Master Chang, we had agreed on it that we would come to you today. But you've been absent. You're not a man of honor. Master Chang. Who am I? I'm a messenger of the Japanese people. I'm a cultural ambassador of the Empire of Japan. A cultural ambassador? Fine. I'll tattoo for you. This is the way of showing your hospitality. Have you ever heard of Yang dragon? Yang dragon? Is it from the west, or from the east? Yang means the sun. You've never heard of it, right? Master Chang, please tell me more. Cut your chest with this knife. There'll be a dragon-figured protrusion. That's my friend. But, tonight, it's not me who want the tattoo, but her. Come on. Master Chang, look! Is there should be two lions playing the wedding ball? Or... Two dragons are playing with a pearl. Yang dragon. It's not the right time. Calm down. What will you tattoo for her? She said you're the tattooist, so you'll decide it. We have children here. How about going to her home? Jiaoping Town, at the opposite bank of the river, used to be the place where French ambassadors lived. I'll find the place. Where? Give me some time. I'll tell you tomorrow. Master Chang, your guest has arrived. Please. Master Chang. Master Chang. Please tattoo at the right place as the picture shows. Just leave Yang dragon to me. Woman should have Yin tattoo. I heard that Master Chang usually show tenderness for girls. She's yours today. Watch out. ﻿Asano. Zhongshi? Already dead? Isn't him Master Chang? - Traitor! - Stop. Beat him! You should stop the waterwheel! Beat him! I said beat him! I'll kill you! Traitor! My uncle is nice to you. Why did you kill him? Let me go. Director Luo is coming. Step aside. Director Luo is coming. Director Luo, you can't get in. What are you doing? Let Chang go. I said you can't get in. Boss Long has the order to let Chang go. Let him go. That damn traitor killed my uncle. You're asking me to let go of him! You uncle is not killed by Chang. I've checked on the spot. The bullet was shot from outside. It has nothing to do with him. Let him go. Step aside! Shao Zhongshi said you have something urgent to see him. I didn't. Who said that to you? Manager Xu told me. Shao Zhongshi being so worried, he thought something must be wrong in our society. So Xu told him your room number. I need to know it right now. Where should I go? Tomorrow morning, at 9, we'll come to see you. People will die when Asano comes to see me. That's the fact. We'd better take some actions rather than just stay and wait. Lan, there're two letters. Bring the one with pattern to Uncle Yin-yang. And bring this one to Boss Long. If I haven't come back before night falls, you'll bring them to the Black Dragon Society. These are very important. Keep them well. Don't lose them. Dad. Where are you going? I'm going to Jiaoping Town. What's the matter, Chang? What going on? Chang. Start the boat. Wait a second. Come on. Chang! Chang, you can't go! Chang, come back! Yin-yang, I have something very important to do today. If something happened to me, please take care of Lan. Thank you, my bro. ﻿Boss Long, Jiaoping Town is not our place. In order to prove my innocence, I will kill Asano there today. And then hand myself in. I would say that he's jealous with me, it's my mistake to kill him by accident. Is Asano here? No. When will he come back? He's not coming back. He's not here. He doesn't live here? Please find him and get him back. I'm looking for him. I don't know where he is. It seems that she not lying. Invisible and untraceable, indeed Asano's style. Fine. Then I'll wait for him here. Will Asano come here today? Why you've been asking about him all the time? Here hurts a lot. I want you... I am not Asano. It hurts me a lot. Aren't you a men? That's right to feel hurt. I'll be gentle. You're scared. You're afraid of Asano. Restroom. I'm afraid of him? I'm expecting him. Running out of time. Leave. Take off your clothes. Aren't you afraid that Asano may come back at anytime? If he came back, you two would start a fight. If you two started a fight, I would kill you both from behind. I have to tattoo for you. Tattoo? You think I would love such an urly pattern on me? While suffering a lot from that? Do you on earth know what my name is or not? Aren't you named Yingji? Does Eiki sound like a Japanese name for you? You don't understand. He's just using me as a pawn. So are you. Take off. Excuse me then. Rock, paper, scissors. Can you lower your voice? Hush.. Rock, paper, scissors. Ahh I win! Cover your eyes, turn around. Do not peek. OK. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Are you ready? I'm coming for you. Hurry up! What's this? Take away. Lan. Lan. Lan. Dad. Are you OK? Don't worry, I'm back. Tell me, what happened? ﻿Little Dragon, ﻿Little Dragon and grandma have died. Come out. I'll kill you. You come out, I'll kill you by myself. Me whole family are dead. I didn't expect that my mom was killed by you. You get out. ﻿Song, I just come to ask. Did Boss Long say that nobody is allowed to get in? Today, my men won't let go of it, if he doesn't die. Right. Up to now, there have been five people died for him. It's unjust if we let him go. Yeah. He went to meet Japanese in private. Especially when so many people in this town have been killed recently. The key point is that her daughter was at the scene. Why only his daughter is still alive. Song, about this issue, you don't... Fine, fine. ﻿Boss Long. Dad. ﻿Boss Long. Lan. Are you OK? Where are those two letters I give you? Letters are lost but clothes are found back. Nobody touches Chang and Lan without my permission. Yes sir! I saw Uncle Weak Dragon just now. He's so scary. I know. Grandpa and Little Dragon were suddenly gone. He's mad because of great grief. At that moment, in Chilong's eyes, I saw Death befall. Although we once went through thick and thin together. Flunky! Dad. Beat him to death! Beat him! Flunky! Traitor! Beat! Don't be afraid. Get them out of here. In order to calm down our buddies, the gang decided to vote for my life and death. For Chilong, The best candidate to kill me is the Man of Yin and Yang. On one hand, It's a further test for him. On the other hand, to let me die in a fair way. But, it's too hard for Yin-yang. Chang, Uncle Yin-yang, uncle Yin-yang look at my new catapult. How does it work? Nice shot. This is my catapult not a gun. Gun has no emotion. Lan, leave us alone for a moment, I have some words with your Uncle Yin-yang. Come back early. What the matter? Bro, I want a Yi and Yang eye at the back of the head, at the intersetion of yin and yang. It's a death curse to have a Yin and Yang eye tattoo there. Who has that tattoo must die. So what? I want this Yin and Yang eye for sure. Bro, why must you do it? I want to try my luck. Bro, I come here to kill you today. Can you? Come here. The skin is nice prepared. Zhang Mazi's work. Percipient bro. For the Man of Yin and Yang. I'm like his brother and father. His real name is Yin Changshi. Given by Chilong. Changshi, means picked by Chang. Chang, my life is given by you, but now I'm taking away yours. Goodbye brother. I will pay you back the double in the afterlife. Behave yourself! Master Chang, please come with me. Goodbye. Uncle Yin-yang. Uncle Yin-yang. Stay here Lan. Uncle Yin-yang! Uncle Yin-yang! Uncle Yin-yang! Uncle Yin-yang! He's still alive! He's sill alive! Dad he's still alive! Dad, dad! Save Uncle Yin-yang! Uncle Yin-yang. Lan, don't be afraid Lan, don't be afraid. I'm is here, I'm here. Is Uncle Yin-yang dead? I want to see him. Don't worry, he won't die. He has a phoenix at his back head. I changed the Yin and Yang eye into phoenix eye at the intersection. Next time I see Uncle Yin-yang, I will take a good look at his phoenix. OK. Master Chang, where are you going? Toilet. Toilet is in the backyard. You don't look familiar. I'm nobody. Master Chang, of course don't know me. What's your last name? Zhang, Zh-ang zhang. It seems Jiang Yuemin and that scar face are acquaintances. I've never seen him again after they left. I can see from that man's body figure that he knows Kungfu. Mr Zhang. Fast moves. Jiang Yuemin. It appears that this scar face is a regular guest of Luo's. So what's the relationship among he, Jiang Yuemin, and Luo Hongpu? No. I feel something's wrong. Lan, let me give you a tattoo of catapult. Where? On your shoulder. Great! Awesome! Does it hurt a lot? I can use pin header. Fast and no pain. And, this is a very very beautiful little catapult. Mom. From now on, it will be with you forever. OK. Ok go. Dad, dad! Dad, dad! Dad. Don't move. Go. What do you mean? Thanks to the common friend we have. Common friend? Jiang Yuemin. Your classmate and good friend Jiang Yuemin. I and him have been out of touch for five of six years. What can he say about me? Everything about you, including that little dragon on your bone. Don't move. These birds are brought me. They are everywhere. The Director of the Police Station Bureau turns out to be a member of a underground gang. If your leader knew these things, your position has no way to be saved. What do you want? I want you help me destroy Black Dragon Society. Sorry. Since you feel sorry for me, why did you frame me for it? Tattoo. In the town, only you have the reason to let Asano to go meet you. Master Chang, I have a question for you. If without me, what would Black Dragon Society be like now? Brother. Let me tell you the truth of my heart. The loyalty and justice you're pursuing have been out pf date. Why Chilong helped and supported me? Because he know clearly that without my position as the PSB Director, he can have nothing under his control. I'm not afraid of being killed. I can kill Asano. But what's next? The Sino-Japanese War is about to break out. Everything will change with the current situation. Will my sacrifice still be valuable at the time? Valuable or not, justice will prevail. Bro, Don't give me empty stuff like this any more. What empty? These are rules of the underworld. The underworld is vanishing. So are the underworld's rules. Through the history, only the times produce their heroes. You succeed, you decise the rules. Jiang Yuemin. you ruined me. You made me become a brute like you. My bro Chang is dying. I'll let you suffer from being alive. Now I know. You want to use Japanese to do this. Rest your heart bro. I will never become a traitor. As a Chinese soldier, I'm ready to go to the front line at anytime. If you have any conscience, please let Lan go. You, killed Chilong. Bro, this box, take it with you. You'll need it. Before you kill me, I have something to say with Lan. Lan, she's on another car. I will let you talk to her. ﻿Boss Long. He's not armed. Hold your fire. What? What are you doing? Boss Long's inside. Chang. You can't do this. I've got Chilong now. Didn't you let me kill him? You let Lan go first. Director Luo, Asano's here. Director Luo, that's so many people. Is it? I have to make sure that nothing goes wrong. Is master Chang here? All are there inside. You'll ruin your whole life's reputation by doing so. No worries Song. I won't kill Chilong. Otherwise, I would be as disloyal as Luo Hongfu. I really admire your courage to draw on so many people. Aren't you afraid they might leak the secret? Lan, do you want to see your dad? Yes, where is he? He's in Three-in-One Club. Go. Hold you fire. Dad, dad! Where are you? Lan! Come here. Director Luo. Impressive. You can even do him a favor in the end. Something more impressive is coming up. Follow me. Calm down. Drop the weapons. Director Luo, now you impress me even more. Tomorrow the newspaper would say that Japanese spies fight with a local gang, both are dead. Don't do anything that you will regret. These soldiers you're the boss. They will keep the secret for you. Company commander Wang and they will go north tomorrow. The fight with you today can be taken as a farewell. Director Luo, it seems that I underestimated you. ﻿Asano, do you want to be executed here? Or do you want to follow the bushido and ho fight your enemies to death? Kill them all! Lan. Find a place to hide. Watch your back Chang. Lan. Asano! Chang! Uncle Long! Was Luo Hongfu that let you in? He betrayed you, like how he betrayed me. Be that as it may, I still thank him for giving me the chance to kill Master Chang. Dragons and fishes get mixed up. Dragons and fishes get mixed up. The perfect state. I'll get you skinned off today. Get away! Lan, go hide yourself! Dad! Lan! Later when I light up the fire, you run to the small door next to the watercart. I'll take you to swim out here. Lan, do you remember that gecko with a broken tail? Give me a kiss. Remember, later the moment when I shout catapult, you run with all your effort, run as far as you can. No I want to be with you! Sweetie, I will go to find you. Go! Catapult! Sorry, my dear daughter. I can't protect you to grow up in this life. I will in another world, pray for you everyday, bless you to grow up safe and sound. Nothing more to wish. Lan, if you had long hair you must be very beautiful. I don't want long hair. Uncomfortable. Fine. I'll just raise you like a tom boy. Dad. Why this little tree is supporting the big one? Yeah. I'm the big tree, you are the small tree. Hold on. It falls down. Hold on, hold on. Everything is over. Lan! Chang, I'm back. Dad, I have revenged for you.
