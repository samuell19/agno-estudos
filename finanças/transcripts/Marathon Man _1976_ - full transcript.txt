I'll take that now, sir. Thank you. Here you are, sir. Thank you. It must be the heater switch. You told me that last week. Right, and you should've left it. I left it. You didn't leave it long enough. Well, work on it now. You got an appointment? An appointment? What are you, a doctor? The bakery workers' strike continues with no bread in local stores for at least a week. Unseasonable temperatures for New York City... with humidity of 79%. Damn. A South Bronx man takes his own life after killing his wife and 4 children with a machete. In that West Virginia mine disaster... Get away from there. Get out of here. What are you going to do? They got no right. Move that crate. Will you move that heap? I'm talking to you, mister. All right, all right. You're a goddamn menace, you know that? Slow. Do not you tell me slower, you kraut meathead. Slow. Slow. You Limburger-loving schmuck. Hurry up. Go to the hell. Jude. You old Jew. Why, you Nazi bastard. [Yelling In German] Nazi. Nazi. Drive there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Yelling In German] [Yelling In German] Go on. Get going, you Mercedes bastard. Madness. Get going, you son of a bitch. How do you like that? Come on, come on. Damn it. Ha ha. [Speaking German] Come on. How do you like that? [Speaking German] [Sings In German] Hey. Why, you maniac, you. Go on, you son of a... Come on. Come on back. You anti-Semitic bastard, you. Come on back. Yes. Yeah, you, too. [Yells In German] Behind schedule? Put a leash on that dog. Hey. Ha ha ha. Here comes the creep. Yo, Melendez, here comes the creep. Hey, creepy. Hey, chicken. Hey, twinkle-toes. There he comes again. There comes my baby. He is running. Creepy. Oye, creepy. Creepy. Going to time yourself in the shower? [Man Yells In Spanish] What was yesterday? 16:02. It was faster. Shit. Has shattered the peace and calm of this Upper East Side neighbourhood on this traditional Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Apparently, two men have been killed in this traffic accident and explosion and fire that you see going on behind me here. I'm going to talk to some of the people who may have been in this area and see if I can find out what happened. Excuse me, sir, were you here? Yeah. What were you doing in this area? I was taking pictures. Well, can you tell me what happened at all? Well, boom. That's what happened. It was later revealed that one of the men killed here was Klaus Szell, the 72-year-old brother of the infamous Nazi Christian Szell, who was thought to have perished as he attempted to flee Berlin at the end of World War II. This is Tom Ellis, Eyewitness News, reporting direct from the scene. What's this all about? They are protesting against the pollution. They are a pain in the ass. Yes. Janey. Well, London was hectic, but I'm fair. Just fair. Listen, why don't you hop into a cab and get your ass over here? I've got plenty of room. Oh, screw appearances. I miss you. Just a second, Janey. Sir, your clothes are ready. I'm going to hang them in the closet. Excuse me, that's not my suit. It's not mine. Oh, sir. This is an error of the office. Sir. Thank you. Thank you sir. I don't know what that was about. The valet coming into the wrong room, I think. I'm not jittery. Who else knows I'm here? You sure? Listen, Janey, why don't you finish what you're doing and get your ass over here? Wait. Yes sir. If you want to bargain with him, go ahead and try to get him down, but... pardon me. The price is too high. The price is too high. You do speak English? I do not understand. I'd like to offer you half. Now it's my lunch. Come on, come on. Good appetite, good appetite. I guess I didn't do it right, did I? You haven't done anything right all morning. I'm far too sensitive for this kind of work. Something for your crash diet, LeClerc. The least I could do. Thank you, Scylla. My diet is going badly. I'm beginning to think I lack willpower. Why were you surprised to see me? I wasn't. You were when I came in. Did you think I was dead? That's ridiculous. No. I expected you 3 days ago. London got a little busy. I'm over here to do a lot of things. You're only one of them. I haven't got anything for you here. Why not? Well... I couldn't keep it in the shop. Look, I'll have it for you tonight, but you'll have to come with me to the opera. The opera. It's worse than you think. It's a French opera... A very long French opera. You'll have it tonight, won't you? Just leave the ticket at the box office. I'll be there before it's over. Place d'Italie, please. Hey, Mike, who you have for English Lit? Daly. Daly? Aw, he sucks. Which room is Biesenthal's? Room 107. Do you mean you were picked for Biesenthal's seminar? Yeah. You weren't? Ah, Levy. Yes, good of you to come. Won't you join us? Would you tell us the subject of your dissertation, please? Tyranny, sir. The use of tyranny in American political life. Such as? Maybe... Coolidge breaking up the Boston police strike, Roosevelt putting Japanese Americans into concentration camps. You might consider the McCarthy business? Sir? McCarthy. Senator Joseph from Wisconsin, ran a series of tyrannical purges in the fifties. Yes, I'm aware of that, sir. I was planning a chapter on him. Oh, a chapter. I see. Yes. Interesting. Well, now, you four have the dubious honour of having been picked from over 200 applicants for this seminar. Well, let me just say this. There's a shortage of natural resources, there's a shortage of breathable air, there's even a shortage of adequate claret, but there is no shortage of historians. We grind you out like link sausages. It's called progress. Manufacturing doctorates is called progress. Well, I say, "Let us hush this cry of progress till 10,000 years have passed." That's a quote. Who said that? Come on. Who said that? Well, somebody must know the answer. Tennyson. Alfred, Lord Tennyson. My God, you can't compete on a doctoral level and not know Locksley Hall and Locksley Hall Sixty Years Later. I hope you all flunk. Dismissed. Levy. Yep. Come. Come on. Sit, sit. I knew your father. Yes, sir. Rather well, in point of fact. He was my mentor. I know. As I recall, there was another of you. I have an older brother. He's a rich, successful businessman. I think my father would have disowned him. Why are you at Columbia for your doctorate, Levy? It's just the way things worked out. It's not just the way things worked out, Levy. Your father got his doctorate at Columbia. You can't fill his footsteps, I'm sorry to say. You might end up leaving larger tracks than that... Anything is possible... But they'll be your tracks. They won't be his. Why didn't you answer that Tennyson question? Obvious from your face you knew the answer. Well, I... I don't know. How am I to fathom your mind if you continue to hide it from me? If you persist, I'll conclude you're a drone. The McCarthy section is central to your dissertation, yes? See, I don't know, because I haven't... The McCarthy section is central to your dissertation, yes? Yes. You're very worrisome, Levy. You wish to write about a period in our history that destroyed your father. But we're talking about an objective doctoral thesis. It mustn't be turned into a hysterical crusade. That's not the way to clear him. All right. You may go. Sir? Sir, I don't have to worry about clearing him because he was innocent. Don't you think he was innocent, sir? No, I think he was guilty. I think he was guilty of being arrogant and brilliant and of being naive. He was guilty of not being able to cope with the humiliation of being dismissed. But of the charges, I know he was innocent. And if it matters, Levy, I wept the day he died. It was a bad day for all of us. Under no circumstances, do anything but call as soon as you... Yes, I have the number. Bye-bye. Hello. We're meeting tonight, right? At the hotel? No, no, no, make it the Ballet Royal. Same time? No. I'm going to the opera. You go to the opera? Bye. Goodbye. Ciao. There's something going on here that we don't know about. Can't you be a bit more specific? Yes. I almost got my ass blown off at the flea market, and I'd like very much to find out by whom and why. Also, LeClerc was not expecting me. You sure you're not overusing your somewhat limited imagination? The bomb was not imaginary. There's been 3 bombs a day going off since the strikes began. I know that, I know that. Every schmuck with a grievance is busy in his basement right now. Am I crazy? Yeah, you're crazy. But you'll check it out, won't you? Of course we'll check it out. Why is it lately that you constantly need to be reassured? He wouldn't have used you if you weren't the best. [Man Singing In French] [Speaking French] Merci, Monsieur. [Speaking French] Merci, madam. I'm sorry I'm so late. I was down... Excuse me. LeClerc? Nicole? Nicole. Keep going. Keep going. What? LeClerc's dead. It's not safe. Nicole? Scylla. Yes, Scylla? Removals... to my hotel. Room 32? Injuries? Hand. Bad? Alert the clinic. Ok, Scylla. [Speaking French] [Speaking French] Do not move. Sorry. Excuse me, please. Thank you. What was all that about? Oh, I was just telling him how you fucked up a tennis game. What did he say? Well... we won't be playing doubles for a while. Can you move it? That's it? That's it. That's not bad. Szell's brother been killed in Manhattan... An accident with an oil truck. Oh, boy. Any changes? Only everything. They're getting all the couriers. Please, could you tell me? Boss Tweed, around 1875... Boss. Is that his name? Boss? No, that's his nickname. It's William Marcy Tweed. Yeah, I'll write it down for you. They called him Boss because he... He was a corrupt politician... and, in fact, he had a bunch of political hacks around him called the Tweed Ring. Yeah, this I know. Thank you. Could I have the pencil, please? It's mine. Sorry. Miss Opel. Miss Opel. Miss Opel. Hi. Sorry. Sorry. You forgot your book. I thought it might be important. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Your name and address were on the inside of it, in case you were wondering how I knew where you lived. I wasn't. Thank you, again. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. You say good night, but you don't go anywhere. Well, that's because I twisted my ankle on the way down here, so I was just hoping to give it a little rest. But you are not limping. Well, I'm a marathon runner. When you race 26 miles, you don't give in to pain. It hurts, but I don't pay any attention. And you wanted this? Yeah, I mean, I haven't run a whole marathon yet, but I hoped. I wish you good luck. Bye. I'm sorry I stole your book. What? I took your book and put it underneath mine. I didn't know how to talk to you. I was embarrassed, so I took your book. Aren't you embarrassed now? Yeah. I'm humiliated. So why do you pursue people who sit at your library table? I don't. It's just that... you're pretty. Oh. I can't talk about how smart you are. I don't even know you. Anyway, I'm done lying to you. Are you always so incompetent with women? Oh, yes, today is way above average for me. Congratulations. Good night. That's too bad. I could make you so happy. I'm smart as a whip. You won't meet another thief like me in the library again. Come on. Why don't you say you'll see me? Huh? All right. I'll see you again... but it won't come to anything. You can't tell. Yes, I can. Good morning. Oh, we finally arrived. Every day it gets heavier. Bye. You are going to rest when you arrive. [Singing In German] Juana. Come here. I want to talk to him in private. Do something wrong? No, go to the kitchen. Andele, old woman. I'll take care of the lady. How do you say "seals" in French? Phoque. Say, "Look at the phoque." Regarde le phoque. How do you spell it? You don't believe it? I do. How do you spell it? F-O-C. No "K?" Pigeon. Pigeon. Pigeon. Pingouin. Pingouin. Elephant. I like you. I like you, too. Je vous... Je vous... aime bien. Je... Shit. Merde. Yeah, I know. What's the time? 11:37. You're faster. It's because of you. Come on, lunch. One more. Oh, no. Oh, no, Babe, not again. Come on. I can't. Neither can I. Oh, thank God. Come on. What? Babe. Babe. [Speaking French] Oh. Oh. Babe. Dear Doc, I don't feel much like writing... I'm too torn apart, I guess... But maybe I ought to tell you something about Elsa Opel. I met her recently. She's a history student. I think she's Swiss. And in a sense, I guess, we are what you might call smitten. Maybe I should tell you what happened. We were in Central Park one night, and we stayed too late. And you were right about this town, I guess, because we finally got mugged. It's a funny thing. You're always talking about how I don't confront things, but I feel like if I could find those guys, for the first time, I feel like I could... Maybe I could kill them. And it's funny, because I never knew that I could feel like that inside. So what else is there to say? There's nothing else new here. Reach me if you can. Babe. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. Go back to your seats and fasten your seat belts. We have received news from Kennedy airport that there are some problems with the baggage carriers. Let's hope it does not bother you, and we also hope to see you again in one of our flights. Muchas thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have news, unfortunately, that there has been no solution to the baggage handlers' strike at Kennedy Airport, and we trust that this will not cause you too great an inconvenience and that you will once again fly with us. Muchas thank you. There you are. Will all those passengers who have identified their baggage please leave as fast as possible for customs by the ramp directly in front of you? As soon as you find your baggage, please... What should I put on it? Oh. The land of plenty. They were always so confident God was on their side. Now I think they are not so sure. Who's there? Who is it? Who is it? I got a gun. I got a gun. Fuck. Articulate as always. You prick. You scared the shit out of me. What time is it? I don't know. It must be about midnight. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? Well, I wanted to test your reflexes. Oh, you're still challenging me, huh? As always. Don't worry about me. Watch it. Watch it there, buddy. Waking me up in the middle of the fucking night. You prick. What's the matter? I can take you with one hand. Here it comes. Here it comes. How are you? Fine. How are you? You look terrific. You look terrific. What happened? Lousy bottle of mouton broke on me. Hey, get some glasses. Oh, Christ, do I have to hear a lecture on the glories of a burgundy again? This is a Beaujolais, schmuck. Moulin-a-Vent, '71. Don't you ever clean this armpit of a place? How can you live like this? You know, I'm down in Washington now. Here we go. I could put you up. You could go to school at Georgetown. No, thank you, but I prefer my hovel. Here. I'll do it. Thanks. You did it, huh? Yeah. Ooh, you really are uncouth. Oh, come on, you said you wanted glasses. You didn't say they had to be clean, asshole. So. How's business? The oil business is always good. You're just a bunch of goddamn polluters and thieves. Well, it's a crazy world, and any way you can skin it is your business. Cheers. Up yours. Irmgaard must love your style. We don't drink this shit. What is it? So what happened to you two in the park? Exactly what I wrote you. How many were there? 2. Kids? No, no, far from it. They were more like businessmen. They looked like you. They had suits on. What's this? More bullshit for your thesis? It's some interviews about Dad. I'd like you to read it. Not interested. Why not? I just want you to read it. You're never going to face it, are you? The old man is dead. He was a drunk. He killed himself. Yeah, but he didn't start to drink until after the hearings. It's right here in the interviews. - You got to be kidding. - I got it from his friends. Where were those people when he needed them? They were afraid like everybody else. You think he wanted you throwing your life away on this shit? I don't think I'm throwing it away. You are. Nothing you write is going to change anything. Why can't you give me the courtesy to read it? It's over. Forget it. Maybe for you. What do you want me to do? Become a corporate hustler like you? No. What? My life's thrown away, anyway. What do you mean? I'm supposed to be the best in my business, right? I'm the best, because people think I'm the best. I'm past it, and I know it. And sooner or later, it's going to become common knowledge. Boy, something's got you. Babe... I bet you still got that goddamn gun. Why do you keep it? I don't know. For a liberal pacifist, you've got some sense of vengeance. Is Helga as morbid as you? I know you're trying to bait me, you bastard. You know her name isn't Helga or Ursula or Irmgaard. You know goddamn well... You know what her name is. All right, all right. How about if I take you and Elsa to lunch tomorrow, if you promise not to eat with your fingers. I promise. It's a deal. Ok, I get the bed. Same as always. You have any clean sheets? I think I may have one left. Babe... I really want to say that... What? What? I'm glad to see you. Doc? I'm glad you came down. When's the last time you took a subway? Oh, about 1962. Excuse me, sir. Would you mind putting on this tie, please? Why? I'm afraid it's a rule of the house. You have to wear a tie here. I don't have a button on the collar. You can just put it here. Would you like me to help you? No. I can do it. Fine. Thank you very much. - What a klutz. - What? How could you forget a tie? I didn't forget it. Who wears a tie when they eat lunch? Well, at least his fly is buttoned. The truffles en croute here are marvellous. If you get hungry, I'll send the waiter out to the McDonald's. This look all right? Perfect. Monsieur. Sir. Number 36, please. Chablis. Yes, sir. Very good, sir. You know, the great Chablis of the world are almost always green-eyed. In fact, they're the ones that most resemble diamonds. Please, please, start. Sir. You approve? Too much. It's delicious. It should be. I could pay my tuition for what this meal costs. See the watch he gave me the last time he was here. Nice. Do you miss home? I bet you do. What do you miss most of all? The people? Country? Skiing? No. I suppose all of them. I'm not really that familiar with Switzerland. What part are you from? A tiny place... Thank you. Ferbiere. - Ferbiere? - Yeah. Oh, I don't believe it. What? There's this guy that works in my office, a ski bum, a real pain-the-ass about skiing... Excuse me. But he's always going on about Ferbiere. That's right at the Mont of... at the foot of Mont Rosa, isn't it? He says it's some of the best skiing in the world. - Is that true? - Of course. - Is he 100% right? - Sure. Then you must know Claude LaSoeur, the instructor there. Have you skied with him? Yeah. Where is it? Ferbiere. Ferbiere. I've made all this up. There is no Mont Rosa in Ferbiere and no Claude LaSoeur. You're not Swiss. What are you? What are you? Can't you guess? Sure. German. Anything else? How long are your working papers good for? Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. If it's a joke, it's not funny. I don't need work papers. I'm a student here. [Speaking Foreign Language] I don't know. Whatever you're doing... Many foreigners marry Americans to make things nice and legal. Then all of a sudden, the marriages don't work out. Is that what you think of me? Look, stop it. Just stop it, man. Why don't you ask me if I care for him? Why bother? You haven't told the truth so far. But why don't you ask me if I love him? Why don't you... Ok, wait a minute. It's all right, El... Elsa, wait. - Let her go. - Why? She's a phony. She's after something. Can't you see it? Why don't you stay out of it? You ordered Scylla to be prompt. Yeah. You keep me waiting. Why? To upset me? Good evening. I'm not one to be mocked. And your behaviour... Don't give me any shit about my behaviour, not after what you've been pulling. I've done nothing. You going to tell me that Chen acted on his own? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't mind you hiring him, but my brother, for Christ's sakes, did you have to involve him? It was nothing. It was a violation. We do not involve family. We never involve family. Think of it as a warning, nothing more. Think of that as a warning, nothing more. You'd like to fight, wouldn't you? It will not happen. I'm much too old and far too smart for that, but we must talk truthfully. Are you to be trusted? No. Is that the truth? Were you trying again to upset me? I know that you're going to the bank sooner or later. Perhaps I've already been. If you had, you wouldn't be here talking to me, would you? What else do you know? I know that you're panicking. You think when you leave the bank, someone's gonna rob you. Who would do such a thing? Obviously you think I would. Well... can I trust you? You never could. You only had to. We're talking of my safety. May I be candid? Yes. I couldn't give a fuck about your... Hello. Yeah? Hi, Elsa. Are you all right? Did you get my note? You know, I've been trying you for 2 hours. Finally, I just went running. All right. What? It doesn't matter. It does. I don't care. Just forget it. It didn't happen. What? I lied about the Swiss because... yes. I think it is really important. Take it easy, will you? I can't understand. Then you understand? Let me come over. I just want to take a shower, ok? I'll take a shower, I'll be there? Ok, bye. Doc. Doc... What? What? Babe? What? I can't hear you. Ba... Ba... You look at me like I'm doing something wrong. Like I did something wrong. I don't understand it. I'm trying to tell you I don't know anything. Your name, please. I told you my name. Take it easy, will you? My name is Thomas Babington Levy. You're a student. I come from a family of historians. Here. Here's my card. And that's the proof. Please put those papers down. Please tell him to put the... Put the papers down. Take it easy. What's in the papers? They have to do with a paper that I'm writing. Would you tell me who this is? My father. Where can we contact him? He's not alive anymore. And this. Is this yours? It's fully licensed, and you can find the licence in the drawer. Look, I don't know anything. Why do you keep asking me these questions that have nothing to do with what's going on? Ok. That's enough for now. Here. Thanks. I know this wasn't easy, and this is a bad time for you, but it's got to be done. I think you... you can understand that, right? Evening, sir. Whoever did it must have set him up, Commander. Get them all out of here. I'll get the ambulance guys. I'm sorry to intrude. I was a friend of your brother's. My name's Peter Janeway, but you can call me Janey... All of my friends do. I'm not your friend. Listen, I'm as anxious as you are to find out whoever did this. I'm a little more anxious, wouldn't you agree? All right, listen, I think it may have been political. Political, why? Well, considering what your brother did... - What? - And your father, of course. What about my father? Well, he was H.V. Levy, for Christ's sake. Yeah, and he's been dead for 20 years, and he was innocent, so what are you saying? I'm sorry. Come on. Come on. Get off my back. They've been after me for 2 hours. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply that... They told me they were done. What are you saying? I'm sorry. Come in. Listen... why don't we begin with what happened tonight? Perhaps you could... give me some of the details. I was here, Doc died, you came. That's it? I'm a demon for details. All right, so you want me to do a little explaining, is that it? That's right. Where did your brother live? In Washington. And what did he do? He was in the oil business. Wrong. I know exactly how Doc made his living, and the closest he ever came to the oil business was when he filled up at his friendly neighbourhood gas station. Why don't you tell me what you're talking about? All right, follow me now. Doc lived in Washington. What's Washington the centre of? Government. Correct. And all the branches are competitive. The truth is, they're all paranoid schmucks. Now, when the gap gets too large between what the FBI can handle effectively and what the CIA doesn't want to deal with, that's where we come in. Who's we? The Division. You telling me that my brother worked with you? Yes. You're full of shit. What do you do exactly? We provide. Provide what? Anything. And you two worked together? Why didn't Doc tell me? Why did he lie to me? He was afraid you'd be disappointed in him, I expect. We were very close for many years. Believe me, I know whereof I speak. Doc obviously was desperate to get here at the end. Do you remember anything he might have said? He said... my name a couple of times. Ok, I'm just guessing now, but, whoever killed him will probably want to speak to you. I don't know anything. Well, they can't be sure until they talk with you, can they? I'm staying just across the park at the Carlyle. And if you don't mind, I'd like to use you as possible bait. Bait? You don't think they'll come tonight? No. Look, I know it's risky. And I don't want to force you to do it. It's up to you. All right. All right. No. Wait. Help. Help. Help. Police. Somebody help me. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Shit. Is it safe? Is it safe? Are you talking to me? Is it safe? Is what safe? Is it safe? I don't know what you mean. I can't tell you if something is safe or not unless I know specifically what you're talking about. Is it safe? Tell me what the "it" refers to. Is it safe? Yes, it's safe. It's very safe. It's so safe you wouldn't believe it. Is it safe? No, it's not safe. It's... very dangerous. Be careful. Relax. Relax. Relax. Come on. Open. Come on. Ok. Ok. That hurt? Huh. I should think it would. You should take better care of your teeth. You have a... quite a cavity here. Is it safe? Look, I told you, I can't... You think he knows? Of course he knows. He's being very stubborn. Wait. Please. Please, don't. No. No. It's ok. Huh? Isn't that remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results. Life can be that simple. Relief... discomfort. Now, which of these I next apply, that decision is in your hands, so... take your time and tell me... is it safe? Please stop. Please stop. Please. Aw, take him. I got him. Take him in yourself. More. Thank you. More. Hey, you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, things are starting to come together. Keep your head down before you get it blown off. Those 2 guys I just wasted worked for a man named Christian Szell. Does that name mean anything to you? No. He ran the experimental camp at Auschwitz, where they called him the White Angel, the Weisse Engel, because he had this incredible head of white hair. He's probably the wealthiest and most-wanted Nazi left alive, and he's hiding out somewhere in Uruguay. In 1945, Szell let it be known around Auschwitz that he could provide escape for any Jew who was willing to pay the price. He started out with gold, naturally, but very quickly worked his way up to diamonds. - Have you heard of this before? - No. Szell saw the end early. And he snuck his brother into America with his diamonds. They're right here, in New York, in a safe deposit box. Szell's brother had the key. The only other key was kept by Szell in Uruguay. And now if he comes out of hiding to use it, he's gonna expose himself to incredible risk. Everything worked out fine, until his brother got killed in a head-on collision with an oil truck. Why did you say "naturally" when you said he'd started with gold? He knocked it out of the Jews' teeth before he burned them. Szell was a dentist. He's not coming to America, Mr.Janeway. He's here. He can't be here. We'd already know it if he was. He's here. That was the dentist that almost killed me. He kept saying, "Is it safe, is it safe," over and over. Did he have white hair? Keep your head down. - He was bald. - Bald? The son of a bitch has shaved his head. He's here. And he's panicked. Why is he after me? Because your brother was one of the couriers that transported the diamonds to Paris. Obviously, Szell thinks Doc said something to you before he died. Now, did he say anything to you? What do you mean? You saying my brother worked for Szell? No. He worked for us. Everything we do cuts both ways. Szell ratted on all of his buddies. He kept track of all the old Nazis throughout the world. Whenever we wanted to bring one of them in, we went to Szell. Now, listen, Babe, you got to do one thing for me. Name it. What? - Quit protecting Doc. - I'm not. He kept himself alive long enough to tell you something. - What did he say? - He didn't say a thing. He must have said something. Tell me what he said. - Nothing. - Shit. I saw you kill them. You killed them. You killed them. You killed them. You fucking killed them. You killed my brother. I don't think he knows anything. And I think he knows too much. You can afford to think what you wish. I can't. The gun had blanks, the knife a retractable blade. Hardly original, but effective enough. I think you'll agree. I'm told you are a graduate student. Brilliant, yes? You are an historian, and I am part of history. I should have thought you would have found me interesting. Frankly, I am disappointed in your silence. Why do you have so little accent? I had Alexia as a child. Alexia is a disease... I know. It's when you can't understand written speech. Highest marks. My writing is childish, still, but I'm a fanatic about spoken language. I envy you your school days. Enjoy them fully. It's the last time in your life no one expects anything of you. Oh, I know. I behaved terribly. But I had to be sure of what you knew. You see, I'm positive your brother meant to rob me when I left the bank with my diamonds. I don't know anything. Was Scylla planning the robbery alone? Robbery? Do you know the value of diamonds? No. No, I don't. Neither do I, not in today's market. Tomorrow I must go and find out before I go to the bank. You see... your brother was incredibly strong. Strength is often inherited. He died in your arms. He travelled far and in great pain to do that. There has to be a reason. I don't know... I don't know anything. Karl. Oh, please don't worry. I'm not going into that cavity. That nerve's already dying. A live, freshly cut nerve is infinitely more sensitive. So I'll just drill into a healthy tooth until I reach the pulp, unless of course you can tell me that it's safe. Aaah. Erhard. He knew nothing. If he had known, he would have told. Get rid of him. I don't think you've heard the news. What is that? You're leaving tomorrow on the 1:00 flight. You are a very confident young man. It's all a front. Just think of me as any other young executive on the come. You're uncontrollable. What you offer us is valuable, but it's not worth the chaos you're causing. And if I am unable to conclude my business by 1:00? Well, you'll just have to manage that, won't you? As far as we're concerned, Mr. Szell, you're a relic, and you're on your way. Thus far, I find you rather detestable. May I say that without hurting your feelings? Praise from Caesar. I'm just doing my job. I believe in my country. So did we all. Jesus. Come on. Come on. Unlock it. Get him. Get him. Come back. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Stop. Stop. He went around the corner. Get the fucking car. He's on the north ramp. Come on, for Christ's sakes. Hey. Hey. Run him down. Run him down. What the fuck are you doing? What are you walking away for? What's going on? You guys are crazy or something. No, don't slow down. Keep going. Keep going. You can drop me at the corner. Listen, could you give me a dime? I have to make a phone call. What do you mean, give you a dime? Here. Take this and just give me a dime. Ok? Wait a minute, man. Let me see what you got here. Please give me a dime. It's a Rolex, my brother's watch. Hey, come on. Please. Here's a dime, man. Here's some more change. Hello. - Elsa? - Hello. - Babe. - Babe? Listen... What's the time? What time is it? I don't know. About 5:00. I want you to do something for me. - What? - I want you to meet me. Where? 51st and Broadway. Babe, I can't. There's an all-night drug store. Why? Tell me what happened. Just get a hold of a car. Please. In an hour. But why? I'll tell you later. Where? 51st and Broadway. 51st and Broadway. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. [Woman Yelling In Spanish] Mrs. Melendez, please, I have to see your son. Please let me talk to your son. It's important. Where is it your son? It's very important. Where is it your son? Please. Please. It's very important. Please. Cut your goddamn finger off if you don't let go of that buzzer. Melendez, it's me. Please, open the door. I want you to do a job for me. One more time, I'm coming down with a butcher knife, got it? Please, I'm from across the street. I just want you to do something for me. Open the door. Who is this? It's Levy. It's Tom Levy from across the street. Who the fuck is this? Tom... Creepy. It's the creep. Creepy? Open up. What the fuck happened to you? Come here. Shit, man, it's past my bedtime. Listen, I want you to rob my apartment. Why? There's some guys out there after me. I got a gun in my desk drawer, and I want you to get me some clothes. What's in it for me, man? I got a TV set, I got a hi-fi. You can take it all. Do it. Hey, what's the catch, Jack? The catch is it's dangerous. Please do it. That ain't the catch. It's the fun. Come on. All right, you guys. Let's go. Move out of there. Blow it out your ass, motherfucker. Leave the table. Help me with television. No, leave it. The stereo. Is on the table. Hi. Hi, Elsa. How are... Babe, what's happened? God, I'm glad you're here. What's happened to you? I'll tell you later. Let's go. You like it? I must get the key. How did you find this place? I hope the key is where it's supposed to be. How did you find it? I have a girlfriend in my building. It belongs to her family. Ah. Is it Szell's? Szell's? Is it Szell's? You're very tired. Where is Janeway? Huh? What do you do for Szell? - Babe. - What, Elsa? I'm sorry. I didn't know... Tell me when they're coming. I want to explain. What do you do for him? Just tell me, what do you do... Let me explain... Explain. Just explain. Explain it. Explain my brother. Say it. Say it. You fucking stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Tell me when they're coming. I don't know, Babe. I... Soon. Good. Thanks. When did you know? I didn't... till now. Whose house is this? Szell's brother. There's nobody here. Let's go. Please, Babe, let's go. We still have time. I can get you out of here. So that was Szell? What's keeping them? I don't know. What were you? Were you Szell's mistress? Tell me. I was a courier, nothing more. I took money from Paris into Uruguay, that's all. I never even met him. God, you're pretty. Where is he? Where's Szell? Where's Szell? It's a lovely morning. Hold it. Awaiting further instructions. Do we take 3 giant steps, or what? The cops will be here soon. You know, I don't think the police are coming. Neither do I, but I could be wrong. Listen, I think we can work out whatever it is you want to work out, but don't you think we ought to do it inside? Ok. One at a time. No. Over here, over here. Sit, sit. I think you should realise that we're only authorised to go to certain limits. Oh, cut the bullshit. Tell me where Szell is. Why'd you let us get so close? You're all in my killing range now. Taken a little target practise, have you? A wizard at hitting paper? It's not the same with flesh. Smashing bone is different... I want to know where... Hey. Szell is. If the police were coming, I don't think you'd be so panicky. Oh, they're coming. Somehow I don't believe that. Turn that on. Easy, easy. We're all gonna take it easy. Isn't that right, Erhard? We're all just gonna sit here and wait for the police and relax, right, Karl? Where... Where is he? Elsa, why don't you move away from him a little bit and give the boy some room to breathe? Get away from him. No. Drop it. Drop it. Get that gun down. All right, all right, it's down. I didn't want this to happen, but I couldn't trust her. I'll give you Szell for your brother. He's at a bank at 58th and Madison. Go. Go. Babe. What were you looking for, sir? Is there anything we can get you today, sir? Morning, sir. Anything I could interest you in today? I wouldn't say it was wrapped up. I can't give you that much. It cost that. That much, I don't make on it. Ok, maybe we can make a trade. Oh, please, Mr. Goldman, don't talk me into any trades. I want cash for the ring. If you want cash, I'll give you cash. Let me take a look at it. Don't worry about it. I'd like to see a 3-carat diamond. Why? If all you're interested in is just to see, go window-shopping. I was interested in... First, there's got to be trust, right? So what I'll do is I'll get this 3-carat stone, see? And we'll take it one flight up to this independent appraiser I know, and if he doesn't swear that I'm practically giving this stone away, well, I'll just have to get myself a new brother-in-law. Ha ha. Listen, I'm gonna do you a big favour. Can't you just tell me what it's worth? I'm no high-pressure artist. I sell diamonds. You never answer me. I'm only interested in gem quality. Something around the size of my little fingernail. You're talking 6 carats, sir. More, probably. Oh, it would not be prohibitive, do you think? 15,000. 15? Per carat, naturally. Naturally. I know you. Perhaps you do. I'm pretty good at faces myself. I know this man from somewhere. Christopher Hess. How do you do? Christopher Hess. How do you do? Wait, wait. Let me think. I think... surely you came to our antique shop in London. No, that wasn't it. No, but you've been to London? Sure, but I don't think... Hess of Gold Is Green. We've been there since '33, when we got out of Germany, my wife and I. Our little shop is quite fashionable now. I always wanted to visit London. Oh, well, I suggest you hurry while it's still there. Well, I thank you for your time, and I'm sorry. 90,000 is far too high for me. Our little shop isn't that fashionable. Thank you. I know that man. It can't be. Szell? Szell. Szell. Szell. Szell. My God, stop him. Szell. Stop, Szell. It's Szell, Szell. The Weisse Engel. The Weisse Engel is here. Oh, my God. Stop him. Stop him. The Weisse Engel. He must be stopped. My God, he gets away. The Weisse Engel is here. Szell. You stop him. Oh, please help me. He is a beast. He's a murderer. You must stop him. There he goes. He's getting away. She's crazy. I don't know. The Weisse Engel is here. Stop him. Stop him. If you won't stop him, I will stop him. I will stop him. The beast. The beast. I know who you are, you murderer. I know who you are. Help, help. The man needs help here. Help. Quick, a doctor, quick. 58th Street and Madison. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Thank you. 25966. All finished, Henry. Thank you. Everything all right? Oh, yes. See you next week. There you are, sir. Close the door, sir, and no one can enter. Ha. Is everything all right, sir? Yes. Yes. It isn't safe. Move. They're all dead. Move. You would be foolish to do anything hasty. Move. I have things in my possession... You just keep moving. Hey, what are you guys doing in here? We'll just be a little while. There's nobody allowed in here. Ok, get out. Get out. Hurry up. Ok. Let's see what you got. If you will just give me a chance to get this open. That's ok. Take your time. So all this happened because you were afraid you were gonna be robbed? Yes. But you weren't sure. No. Jesus Christ. I was in a state of hysteria, you know. Don't you want to take a closer look than that? No. You see, in a sense, one becomes more emotional with age. First after a lifetime of being taken by friends and enemies alike, and then just when you think you have your possessions sure, your health begins to go. That is, of course, the ultimate theft. That's close enough. And in the circumstances, one's paranoia... I said that's close enough. Gets out of hand. Stop. Well? What are you going to do now? Shoot me? No, I don't think so. Then you are going to take these from me. If I could say a word about that. No, you can keep them. You can keep as many as you can swallow. Pardon me. I'm not quite sure what you said. Swallow? Yeah, swallow. Eat. Essen. You're joking. No, I don't think so. I'm not joking. Essen. Essen. Don't. Wait. That man who was here, he saw your gun. He'll come back and bring others. Swallow. This is madness. Mad. Swallow. Again. No. I won't. You'll have to shoot me. Come on. Shoot. You won't. You can't. You're too weak. Your father was weak in his way, your brother in his, now you in yours. You're all so predictable. Go. Go get them.
