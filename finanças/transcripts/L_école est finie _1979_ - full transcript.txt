SCHOOL'S FINISHED TO OLIVIA Good evening. Are they ready? Be careful, they're—they're still hot. Happy with them? You've made progress. You've been lacking— - Yes, I know. Concentration. - Yes - Here you are. It's the month I owed you. - Thank you. Be on time on Thursday. - All right. Good bye Julien. - Bye. - Bye. HABERDASHERY - KNITWEAR 8 plus 2, 10, and carry 1— - Which shelf does angora go on? Mum? Where do you usually put angora? Wait, I'm almost done. If you talk to me all the time, I'll never get there. So 50 plus 10— Well, what do you want, Nanou? - No, nothing, it's done, I found it. - 7 and 3, 10— That's 20 and 30, 300—. Ah, exactly 300. Have I given you this week's money? - Yes, but I didn't have enough for piano. - I'll give you the difference. - No, if you can't, that's OK. Nanou, have you finished your homework? - Yes - You know, I'd rather you didn't waste time. You remember what you promised me, don't you? - Of course. You'll see, I'll get my diploma. - Yes. Hello. - Hello. - Hi. - Hey. Erik asked me to give you this book. And—since I was passing— - Thanks. - All right, bye Villebois, see you tomorrow. - Bye. - You'll let me know. - Which way are you going? This way. - OK, me too. - How long have you been taking piano lessons? - Oh—two or three years. - No, that's not what I meant. I meant with my cousin. - Oh you know, me, piano— My mother's pushing me. With my old teacher, it wasn't the same. - Why are you laughing? All right, that'll do. I'm going to be late. - It still looked better like that. Gave you a certain style— - See what I look like now— I look like a slob. - A slob? Not at all! It's not easy with your spikes. This way, at least you're a little cleaner. - If you say so! You do this to me every time! Portland, Plymouth. Northwest backing west 3 to 4. Backing south-westerly, 5 to 6, overnight. Rain, then squally showers. Fitzroy, Biscay ... Are you joining the Legion? Oh shut up! Who asked you! Little brother's in a bad mood this morning! You've got off on the wrong foot today? - No! On my dick! - No, Julien! Not in front of your sister. - Don't you think he's better-looking like that? Hurry up Julien, it's quarter past! - Mum, have you seen my schoolbag? - It's there, at the bottom of the stairs. Julien! Julien! A hug. Don't worry, you're still the prettiest. Good morning. - Good morning. I must be late. Isn't Erik here? - No. - What day is it? - Wednesday. - Ah! I must have got the day wrong. What are you doing? This, as you see. - It's beautiful. - Wait, I have an idea. Come here. Sit down. - What are you doing? - Don't be afraid, you'll see. Lie down. - But what are you doing? Julien, I'm scared. - Nathalie? Can I kiss you? Julien? Are you crying? You don't want to answer me? Julien, stop sulking! It's not funny! Why are you playing it so slowly? You're shaking. I have finished reading the book of poems. And, day after day, this stanza keeps coming back to me: "One day we will—Have to scoop up with our hands— Water from a ditch." Dad, I'm stopping now because I have to go down to dinner. PS: The boy I told you about, if he knew you, I know he would like to be your friend. And you would like him very much. Your daughter, Nathalie. My Julien, it's almost midnight and I can't get to sleep. I feel lonely. I miss you. You know, I want a child from you too. A little girl who looks like you and we'll call Julie. Your heart is beating fast. It would be nice if we could change gender. I never liked my room. I want to get rid of all the furniture. I think it takes up too much space. I like being inside you. When we live together we'll have a big house. And I'll do lots of portraits of you. Before, we used to live in the suburbs. My mother made hats. It was too tiring for her, and she couldn't sell enough. So we moved. I have to do something. I'll be back. Grandpa? Grandpa? Why don't you open your shutters? You can't see anything. Grandpa, are you sleeping? - Is that you, Nanou? I thought— Can I go downstairs to watch TV? - But there's nobody down there. Mum's not here. Do you need anything? - Need anything? No. Was it your grandfather? - Yeah, I was worried. - Is he very old? - He's eighty-five. He went deaf during my grandmother's funeral. - Has she been dead a long time? - The end of last year. Hang on, I'll show you. You see, there? That's her with him. Behind them is their house in Toulon. She took care of me until I was six. I remember—when my mother came to pick me up, I didn't want to leave. I hid under the bed in her bedroom. That one's the distribution of prizes. It was a cardboard trumpet. I dreamed of becoming a dancer. And then we moved. - And is that you here? Tonight, before I fall asleep, I'll think hard about you. - Me too. Dad. Give me your beret today, so I can wash it. - Hello Grandpa. - Hello Nanou. - Hello Mum. - Will you please serve your grandfather! - How many sugars do you want? - Two. - You know perfectly well he always takes two! - I know! And if one day he only wants one? He doesn't have to have two every day. How many sugars do you want? - What? - How many sugars do you want? - Ah, sugar—two. Here. It's for you. - Ah, this must be my coursework. It's about time.. - If you'd dealt with it on time— - I know, it's always my fault. - You're free, Nanou. Here Dad. - But what have I done to you? Tell me! Say something! - I don't want to start worrying about you again. Afterwards, it's me who can't sleep at night. You understand? I know you don't care. I believe I give you enough freedom. Watch what you do with it. - It's still not my fault if they send my lessons late. - It's not about that. - But Mum— - You never tell me anything. You hide everything from me. It's as if I don't exist for you. I don't want a repeat of what happened last year. It's too hard for me. What's more, I can't take care of the shop and Dad and— And watch you all the time. - But listen, Mum— - Look, if you want to live your life, then don't ask any more from me. Nanou— I didn't say anything about the boy. You know that? - I know. I never thought you did. Anyway, she does it on purpose so she can spy on me all the time. - Here. This is for you. And that's for the boy. - No, it's yours. - Me? I have a lot more. This is a box I don't keep much in. - If she asks you— - Yes? - No—don't tell her anything. Julien! Sorry Sir. - Yes? - I was asked to come and get Julien Villebois. - By whom? - The Head wants him. - What have you done this time, Villebois? - But I haven't done anything, Sir. - All right, well, go ahead. Quietly. I want to hear all about it, Villebois. - What are you doing here? How did you get in? - I wanted to talk to you. - You're absolutely crazy! You realise—if you get caught—? - But I couldn't wait. I want to talk to you. - Stop shouting! Come on. - It's not transparent, not big, not round. It can't be used for carving. And it starts with a J. Can you guess? I'll help you. If I tell you "twenty-eight". - Twenty-eight? Twenty-eight what? Tell me. Won't you tell me? - Give me your hand. For the last twenty-eight days— growing in my belly—is Julie. - It's true? Are you sure? - Yes! - We're going to live together. The two of us - The three of us. There are still limits to my patience! Have you seen the time? I was going crazy! Last night, I had a strange dream. I totally disappeared into the corner of a room. And a child was looking at me. Julien would like her to look like me. Like in this picture of me when I was a child. I've enclosed a tracing. See you soon, hugs. One day I must find the courage to send you my letters. Are you up already? You know what time it is? You'reoff your head, Julien. Where are you going? - To Erik's, to sculpt. - This early? Seriously, I'll never understand you. On school days, you don't get up until the very last moment. And on Sundays, when you could be sleeping, you're up at dawn. You know, I think you've got a screw loose, just like your father. Are you really going to Erik's, at least? You know I'll ask him. Are you even going to have your coffee? - No, I don't feel like it. Are you coming back to eat? I need to know so I can prepare lunch. - I'll have lunch there. - You're unbelievable! You really do treat me like a servant! You always let me know at the last minute! Not so loud, I'm trying to sleep! - You see! You've just woken up your brother. I wonder what time he was reading to last night. One day, he'll end up completely ruining his eyesight with those books. - Right, I'm off. Bye Mum, see you tonight. - Don't get back too late! Julien! Have you at least done your lessons for Monday? I slept well. All right, once again. Do you prefer living in the city or in the countryside? How many possible answers are there to this question? Yeah, that's easy. How many did you write? Twenty-five? The city when it looks like the countryside. The city when it rains. The city when there are many lights. Sometimes the countryside when it looks like the city. But that's not what they're asking. Look, it's easy though. It's like you say— instead of "Do you prefer living in the city or in the countryside?" Victory or Death". So the "or" has a specific meaning. You don't look at all well, Julien. Really? Erik is in Paris at the moment? - No. He'll be back tomorrow or the day after. I don't remember. Why? - Nothing important. I just need to talk to him. I think you're going to his house a little too often. It's been a long time since I've seen your school report. - We'll have it at the end of the month. As usual. Do you think you've done all you can to get good marks this month? - Oh yes, I think so. Maybe Geography— But otherwise, it's fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. If you had— I don't know— A problem— You would tell me, wouldn't you? Julien? - Listen, Mum. Everything's fine. I can assure you. Ref's a scumbag! Ref's a scumbag! Come on Yellows! Come on Yellows! Yellows! Jump! What the hell are you doing? Come on! - Pass back, for God's sake! Pass! - Shoot! Left! - Shoot! The ball! The ball! Come on you Reds! Come on you Reds! Go on! - Go ahead! Go ahead! Shit! Come on! The ball to the centre! Hey there! Where do you think you are? This isn't rugby! Bring the ball back! Stop him! Just stop him! Stop him! Cheat! Bring the ball to the centre! Move away! We want to play! Go on, shoot! Good! Great! Good game! Good shot! We've got one! Julien! What are you doing here? - Julien, everything's ruined. It's your mother— - What's she done? - She came to see Mum because of the letters. Julien, I don't want to. She wants me to have an abortion. I want to keep her, Julien. I'm keeping her, she's mine. You understand? - Julien! - You won't leave me, will you, Julien? I want to be with you. Anywhere, I don't care. - Hurry up. - You do agree, don't you, Julien? - Julien, shit! The game's over here! Are you dumb? Come on, come on! We got them! We got them! It'll be your fault if we lose. You did that on purpose! I'll show you! Nothing matters to you except a wet pussy! - No, leave me alone, okay? - You want to fight? Crappy footballer! Watch it! You're crazy, aren't you? - Leave him! "What's happened to us is wonderful." "I really want a child with you." "A little girl who looks like you and we'll call Julie." "Now nothing can separate us since I am two months pregnant." "I am so happy—" - Give me that letter! You dirty everything you touch! - Oh! I dirty everything I touch? - I'm warning you, Julien, don't you ever dare talk to me like that again! Otherwise it'll turn out very badly for you, you hear? Never! - Give me that letter! - Certainly not! - Give it to me! My poor Julien, squeeze your nose, and all you'd get is milk. Anyway, your grandfather told me to keep him posted. And that, if necessary, he'd take drastic measures! So get that into your head, my little friend! Where are you going? - Out! I don't want you to go out tonight! - Why? - I don't have to explain myself to you. - Let me out! - No! - Let me pass! - Absolutely not! - Give me a reason. - Because I say so! I'm telling you Julien, if you go out tonight, I'll have the police drag you back! - What—what's wrong with all of you? You're all completely nuts! - Julien! I'm warning you Julien! Keep on like this— Don't bother coming home tonight. You'll find the door locked! Go ahead! Go and find your stupid slut of a girl! Nanou? Nanou. Do you want me to stay with you? You don't want to answer? - Leave me alone! I don't want to see anyone! Julien, are you asleep? Julien, you're crazy. Express train 3263. Express train 3263. Hello Madame, I'm Nathalie Thuillier. I've come to see my father. Yes, I want to see Mr Thuillier. I'm his daughter. - All right, don't stay here. Come with me. Sit down, I'll go and tell my husband. Alexandra, hurry up, the kids are going to be late. Yes Madame. Good morning. Pierre, where's your schoolbag? Ah, it's here. Come here. Let's go! Bye. She's what? What does she want? It's obvious I can't see her now. Surely she can wait for five minutes? - As you wish. Is Nathalie here? - What? - Is Nathalie here? - I'm all alone. My granddaughter had an accident. - An accident? When? - Her mother's gone by train to be with her. - Where? - Toulon. She's just left. Madame Thuillier! Madame Thuillier! - Julien—what are you doing here? - Madame, please—let me come with you. - Don't you think you've done enough? Go on, get off the train! - No! I want to see her. I'm begging you, let me come! - Get off immediately! The train's about to leave. And I don't want to be responsible. - We want to keep our child. Understand? She's ours. Even if nobody wants her. And if she dies, it'll be your fault— - Julien, you're still a child. Precisely yes, because she wants a child with him. But how do you expect me to know? Why? I don't know any more. I'm scared. Yes, whenever you want. Yes! You always say you don't have time. He's still your son, isn't he? No, Raymond, that's not what I meant. No matter what, i certainly care more about them than you do! Because if I didn't, they'd both be under Children's Services by now! Sorry young man. You know, sometimes I feel old. So very old. - Nathalie. Nathalie, look. I promised you. "I want you to stay, since you're my whole life." - You like it? - que tu restes has an "s". Thanks. - Good bye Julien. Don't thank me. Anyway, I do whatever you make me do. Beware of the automatic doors. Beware, this train is about to depart. Here's the three months' rent as we agreed. - It really wasn't urgent, there's plenty of time. I'm very happy to be able to do this for you. Don't worry, she'll be fine here. - Thank you. I'm sorry, I have to go. It's funny when I think I knew her as a baby. I'll show you out. - Thanks. Don't you remember? - What? - On the cover there's a red and blue tapestry. - I don't know where you put your stuff. - Oh it's OK, here it is. Well, you're still here? I thought you were in a hurry. - I can stay for dinner, if you want. - No no. I certainly don't want to force you. - But I don't mind. You go, you come back— You need to decide once and for all if you live here or there. Julien, this isn't a windmill, you know. Was it worth trying to take care of you only to see you now in this state? You look like an alley cat. Well. If you fall ill— Don't come running to me to take care of you. - All right, goodbye Mum. - If you leave, you take everything! That way you won't have to come back. OK? Take this! And this! Here are all your shirts. You think this a good example for your brother and siste? No no, I want you to stay. I don't want you to leave. - I can't miss any more school. - That's okay, I'll teach you. I don't want you to go away. - What if I fail the exams? - We have to give ourselves a chance. What we really want from today is to settle the formalities. - Can I remind you, Mr. Le Tellier, that you rejected my first proposal? - That's not entirely fair, since legally marriage emancipates. Systematically. So— Perhaps I won't come back to the question of the reception. - I found that ridiculous. - Because you didn't want to share the costs. - No, because I think a civil marriage would have been enough. After all, it's not every day you marry your son. - Just as well! - What are you trying to say? - Nothing at all. - By the way, does his father know? - Yes, of course. You'll find that he'll take the opportunity to withhold your alimony. - Excuse me. I drew up the letter of exemption for Julien myself. For the marriage. You just need to sign it. - Yes. I did this to allow my grandson Julien to live with Nathalie in complete legality. Isn't that so, Nathalie? - Yes, we wanted to thank you. But— Well—We just—we wanted to say that— About the wedding— We hadn't really thought about it but, if you think it's better— - Anyway, whatever you want. If you insist. And if you can come to an agreement. Most merciful Father, to whom we raise up our praise, we humbly pray through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord, to accept and bless these holy gifts. We present them to you first for your holy Catholic Church: Give it peace and protect it, deign to gather it in unity and rule over all the earth. We present them at the same time to your servant, the Pope. In front of all here present, now exchange your vows. - Nathalie, Do you want to be my wife? - Yes, I want that. - And you, Julien, Do you want to be my husband? - Yes, I want that. - Lord, our God, You, who made a covenant with us through Jesus Christ, Bless these rings now. And give to Julien and to Nathalie, who will wear them on their fingers, to keep fidelity always. Now you are united by God in marriage. Cerati? - Present. Suchard? - Present. Thuleau? - Present. Uzand? - Present. Villebois? Present. Villebois, I'm waiting for your absence note. Villiers? - Present. Zaadine? - Present. Good, open your French books at page 239. Villebois, I'm still waiting for your absence note. - I don't have one, Sir. - This is the third time this has happened since the beginning of the month, Villebois. Is it the approaching holidays making you run away from school? Perez, clean the blackboard, write the date. Villebois, I'm still awaiting your explanation. - But Sir— - If you have nothing to say to me, Villebois, you may be more talkative in the Director's office. - You just have to tell him. Tell him! Tell him, go on! - If I didn't come yesterday— - Yes? - It's because I was getting married. - Silence! Silence! You're not lacking in audacity, Villebois. - But I assure you, it's true! - If it amuses you so much to entertain your comrades, go and try it in the Director's office. Perez, go with him. - Sir. - Yes, Suchard. - You have to believe him, Sir. I know his wife. He told it to me. - Mmm, is she beautiful? - Suchard, Director's office. Instantly I saw, shining in the depth of the wood, a thousand lights. Every oak tree gave birth, so to speak, to a Gaul. The Barbarians went out in a crowd— That's your mother. - Come in, Mum. - Hi. - Good morning. No, no, don't bother. Don't mind me. - But you're crazy, there's too many. - What do you mean? No, there can never be enough. You have to feed yourself. And when I say "you", you know what I mean. - Great— - Listen Julien, you've read the board five times. I told you your name isn't on it. You can believe me. - It's weird— I dreamed that I passed. Anyway, I dreamed that I passed. HIRING Let's go! That's enough. Shit! I thought they were hiring more people. In the meantime it's the 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment marching up the Avenue de la Motte-Picquet— I was going to say the Champs-Elysées, but that was last year. In front of the President of the Republic. This 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment has a very long history dating back to around 1720. And on its banner, we can read the following inscriptions: Jemappes 1792 Castiglione 1796 Sevastopol 1855 Why are you looking at me like that? ♪ Coming back from the fair ♪ ♪ From the fair of Saint-Cloud ♪ ♪ I met a little man ♪ ♪ Who pawned his wife ♪ ♪ I told him "Little man" ♪ ♪ "I'll pay five cents for her" ♪ Water really comes in all colours. When I was little, when I didn't understand a word, I used to repeat it ten times in my head. All day long. What are you doing? - If you throw it away too, we'll always be together. Will you ever leave me? - No, I will never leave you. Come on. come, for the last one. Nathalie. I love you. I love you. I love you. That's a motorcycle! I don't give a damn about the frills. How much did you pay for it? - 10,000 francs. At that price, you pick up your bag to go back to work. - Can you help me please? - When I sort out insurance, I'll drive you around the block. Excuse me. Really, what do we have to do to find large sizes here? No one's ever around to give information. If we don't need anything, we're served immediately. - Large sizes? - Yes, of course large sizes. I'm not going to wear a size 70. - Do you like this one? - Hey, it's not okay! - What next? - Something nice. A little bit— - This one is nice. - Oh yes. Yes but if the size isn't right— I need 115, I tell you. - Villebois. Someone's on the phone for you. - Hey, don't go. What about my receipt, who's going to do it for me? Allo. Yes No, is it true? Thanks. Thank you so much. Villebois, where are you going? Villebois, where are you going? Young man! Where are you going? - I'm going upstairs. - Are you over fifteen? - I'm going to see my wife. I have a little girl! And also, it was in this room that Lucien was born. If you only knew how happy I was that morning. I would have liked all the bells to start ringing. It's a girl. Hello Julie. He's not going to touch her like that with his dirty hands! Well, my boy. I hope now you'll take things more seriously. - I think we can drink to our little Julie. And to her mother of course. - You'll make yourself ill. You know what the doctor said about your aerophagia attacks. - Oh, a little glass can't hurt. If you listened to everything the doctors tell you on a day like this— She's so tiny. With big cheeks. - He might want her to be two metres tall. - This child is completely normal. I remember you were much worse. All wrinkled and all purplish. You looked like a rabbit that had just unfolded. Ah, I'll remember the day of your birth. It was a real nightmare. We had to use forceps, he didn't want to come out. - That's enough for now, I'd like to rest. - All my congratulations. Goodbye Nathalie. Julien. Julien. Goodbye Mum. - You're staying? Don't tire her too much. - Goodbye Grandma. - Do you realize Mum? I'm one of the youngest grandmothers in France. Mum made them. Erik! I have a little girl! It's me, you see. Won't you answer me? You haven't changed. Me too, you see. I'm almost like... One year is a long time. Like a long permission. But now I know. It's the garden gate that knocks at night. And you too, are you happy to see me again? You know, everyone said to me: "And your family? Are you happy you're back on land?" I didn't say anything. I was only thinking of you. You haven't changed Good morning. - Hi. Is it a strike? I don't have to work then? - Well, no. Take this. You better go home. Well, bye then! - Bye. And then it's more expensive. I'll come back, sorry. You're welcome. - Goodbye Madame. Hello Julien. - Good evening Is Nanou back? - No, not yet. She'd just fallen asleep. Come, my angel, come to me. Nanou will take her. ♪ Julie, honey ♪ Why didn't you take her with you? - Your mother didn't want me to! - You should have taken her anyway! You never see her! Five minutes a day, in the evening. - I see her when I'm given permission to. - And why should you wait for permission? - No, I'm waiting for nothing! Nothing!! - There's no need to shout! - Yes there is! Because it wasn't me who agreed to live here. Anyway, we couldn't afford that place any more. - And now? - Still can't. So we repaint here, to get rid of the old stale smell. It'll take at least ten coats. I've done the first coat. You can do the other nine. Good morning Sir. - I thought I recognized you, but I wasn't absolutely sure. Your mum told me about— A boy or a girl? - A girl. - And what's your name? - Julie. - Hello Julie. This is Aurélia, my daughter. Have you seen this little girl, Aurélia? So Julien, tell me how things are with you. I'm doing fine. - Julien, you know that, besides my classes, I organize photographic exhibitions. I often have to be out very late at night. And I have no one to babysit Aurélia. If you want— - Oh yes, oh yes, yes, of course! Here. - Thanks. Hello Sweetie. Julien, aren't you getting up? It's eight o'clock, I'm going. I left the newspaper for you on the bed. Mum's ticked the job offers for you. Promise to go this morning, Julien? - Yes. - Julien— - Yes! - I'm off. See you tonight. Good morning Sir. - Oh, hello Julien. How are you? - Can I babysit Aurélia tonight? - Why yes, that's fine with me. Now where did I—ah, over there. I must show you the house. It's a large family house. It's a bit messy. - No problem. - What about your baby, how's she doing? - Julie's very well. Dad The more I saw her the less I felt I knew her. It even seemed to me that— Her physiognomy was never quite the same. At that time, being alone for even a day was unbearable to me. Maybe I was too demanding. Asking for the impossible. I always wanted to keep her close. And then there was that trip. - And you never saw her again? - Yes, I did— Five years later. Well, if you can call it seeing someone again. It was in Warsaw. I had organized a photographic exhibition with friends. At first, I thought it was a joke. Among all the photos in the exhibition, there was one not in the catalogue. I knew them all, I had chosen them. She was there. Well, I mean, it was her photograph. A portrait. She was smiling. Who? How? What for? How that photo got there, no one ever found out. You don't understand, Julien. I want you to leave me alone. I need to be alone. Leave me in peace. Alone, Julien, do you understand? Go away! - Nanou. Why? I love you. - You're always telling me about yourself. Rainbow, that lived alone in the air and in the sky. And it was waiting for it to rain and then for it to stop raining to show off. But in this country, the weather was so beautiful that it never appeared. And unfortunately, It—It was traveling alone in the air without showing off. But it said to itself "Oh, I'm so lonely. I'm bored." And one day It—it rained. Allo. So, after the rain Allo Natha—? It went out quickly— Allo, Good morning Madame, sorry to disturb you. Is Julien there, please? and it's very happy—and— Oh no, don't bother him, it's not worth it. If you could just tell him that Paul won't be coming for lunch. Thank you Madame. Yes - but unfortunately it didn't have time On the way down, pick up the nappies on the bed. Julien, a Mr Paul phoned. He said he couldn't come for lunch. I didn't mean to fall asleep. What time is it? - Late, no doubt. - How long have you been here? You can stay the night, if you want. - No, I didn't warn Nathalie. She might be worried. - Julien, wait. I want to talk to you. Perhaps I'm not be the friend you think I am. It's disgusting. I'm a bastard. I lied to you tonight, I— I wasn't at a conference. I was— I was with Nathalie. - With Nanou? - Yes. And that wasn't the first time. - Did you sleep with her? - Yes. - It was too easy. - You can say one word— Tell me never to see her again, and I'll never see her again, I swear to you. Julien. - Don't touch me! Don't touch me. - Julien! Nathalie! Nathalie, the door! Julien. Julien. It hurts. It hurts, you know. Julien. Talk to me. I need you. Talk to me. - Can you hear it? The earth. It looks like it's breathing. English subtitles by jeremys and Marseille TNT 2023
