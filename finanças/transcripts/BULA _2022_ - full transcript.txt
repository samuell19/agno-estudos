Sir, is this how you like it? Sir! Sir, answer me! What do you want? Sir, please! Sir! Did you enjoy that, my love? You didn't look like you were enjoying it. You know, the person who owns that uniform… I feel like her boyfriend's having so much fun with her. I think he already got her pregnant. For sure, she's pregnant. What about me, love?

I didn't see you there. Good morning, Miss Gloria. Good morning. You have a pending load? Just this last one. Hi! Here's your laundry. Thanks. How much for everything? Nobody else can know about this, okay? Promise? Please... Excuse me? Are you okay? Ah. The total is 185. Here. Thanks! Thanks. Her tummy's showing, isn't it? Looks to me like it's been three months. Are you sure? Please. It's so obvious. And did you notice how much water she drinks? I was the same way when I was pregnant with Albert. I hope she's ready to be a mom. She's so young. What a waste. Well, then, I better get this delivered. Let me do it. Huh? I'll do it. Sure? Yeah. All right. Thanks. Does it feel good? Laundry delivery, ma'am. I'll just get the money. Here. Keep the change. This is not enough, ma'am. Oh, sorry. Here's 500. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. By the way, Doc, if you ever need an intern, my son Albert is in med school. Wow! That's amazing! Has he thought about a specialization? - Special what? - I'll take that. Oh, okay. Okay, so just tell him to send me his application. Okay? Thanks, Doc. Here you are, Doc. I wonder what kind of doctor Doc Raquel is. I actually have no idea. But I hope she's a doctor for the rich so she can help Albert. I guess even professionals aren't so different from us, love, huh? They may look serious on the outside but they still feel horny. They may seem formal, but they've got perverted sides too. It's like, as he gets closer, your heart starts beating faster. Let's check your heartbeat. Why isn't it beating faster? Would you like me to make it go faster? Take a deep breath. Why isn't it changing? Oh, I know. Why is it still slow? Why isn't it getting faster? There we go! It's going fast now, love! It's beating faster now, love! Love. Are you okay, love? Where to, miss? Need a ride? Yeah. It won't start. I'll just go down. You're not leaving, Doc. I need you to check on something for me. Listen to this, partner. Another body was found dead near the creek side just this morning. Partner, Is this the one that was injected with poison into his neck? Wasn't there another similar case just last week? Could it be a serial killer? - Oh my god, - Oh no, my friend. - I hope not. - Your theory is alarming. But is it really possible to have a serial killer in the Philippines, partner? We only hear about those abroad. Let's ask the police, partner. Because the question is, how competent are our police force with their investigations for them to make connections between the killings? Let's sit down with the chief of Police North Division to clarify the rumours going around social media. Meldie? Can I leave you in charge? Why, miss? Are you going home? That's the plan. I need to take on extra laundry jobs. Albert needs 60 thousand for his project. That's a lot of money. You said it. Okay, miss. You can go ahead. I can manage. Thank you. Hi, miss! Just here to pick up. Doc, here's your laundry. Oh, dear. Thanks! And you left your bag. Oh, so I left it here. Thanks. Hang on, here's my payment. - Thank you, Doc. - Bye! Okay. Take care. Doc, wait.

I'm looking for something. What is it, sir? The other pair of sock from my last laundry? It's missing. Oh, Meldie... Is this the one, sir? Thanks. I'm dropping off a new batch. So you're a police officer. Huh? How did you know? Sorry, sir. Sorry. I'll do it. I'll do it. - I'll do it. - Let me help you. Thank you, sir. Sir, I know your girlfriend. She's a model. I know who you are. I deliver to you at the top floor unit. She's so lucky to have a police officer as her boyfriend. I don't think so. I'm rarely home these days because of all the killings. We're investigating them. They say it's a serial killer. All right, I should go. Your receipt, sir. Take care, Mr. Palma. Huh? Again, how did you know? Just call me Jacob. I'm Meldie. Okay, I'll go ahead. Thanks. What are you giggling about? Nothing, miss. I just remember that last time I went to deliver to their unit. I heard them doing something. They sounded really fond of each other. I even took a peek. Jesus Christ, what did you see? This one. This is what the girlfriend was wearing. And the guy was wearing a red polo shirt. I can't find it in this pile, actually. Miss Gloria, what if she was with a different guy? Stop playing detective and throw that in the washer! But you know what? It's not so uncommon. My neighbor's husband is also a police officer and that's exactly what's happening to them. You're not entirely off the mark. What have you got there? Hey! What's that? So... Where do you want to eat? Anywhere. We can always go to our favorite Japanese restaurant. We could. Your treat? No, your treat. You have so many projects. Did you check their page what time they close? Not yet, but I'm sure they're still open. Babe, do we still have food in the fridge? I think we ran out. We could have something delivered if you like. Okay. What do you want? Anything. Or I could fix us something. Nah, it's okay. We're both tired. By the way, babe. They gave me a new case. They say it's a serial killer but... we don't have any leads yet. So I might not be home for a few days. Can we have dinner next Friday? I'll reserve a table at our favorite restaurant. Next Friday, babe? My talent agent Gino set a meeting with a producer. I can't move that. Babe, can you prioritize me for once? You're always putting your career first. So if it's my career, I can't prioritize it? Sorry. Sorry.

Same old. Tired from school. By the way, Ma. We have a project coming up. Thought maybe you could spare some cash. Son, sorry, I can't. - I knew it. - I already gave it all to you. Ma, you always say you're out of cash! Okay, son. Look. I'll make it up to you. Just wait a little longer. I'll take on more jobs. But I really need it for the project. It's almost submission. Whatever, Ma. - Hey, let's talk about this. - Just wash these. Okay, but... wait! Sorry about my son. He's very busy in med school. He's stressed that's why he's got a temper. You still wash your son's briefs? Is my laundry done? Ah, yes, sir! Here you go. And here's the five thousand I found inside your pocket. Is this all of it? Yes? I'm pretty sure I had seven thousand in my pocket. That's all there was, sir. Are you sure? That's all that we found, sir. I know your type of people. That fucking asshole. What did your son say he needed 60 thousand for? For his finals project. Here. Wash and dry. Boss. I'm building up an artist for a commercial launch. Her name's Celine Angeles. Yep. I can lend her to you but just for a night. You got it, boss. Yes, boss. I have. Oh, she's good. All right boss, thank you. I'll introduce her to you. And the guy was wearing a red polo shirt. Her name's Celine Angeles. Yes, boss. Okay. All right. Dear. - Yes? - Are you okay? Yes, ma'am. I'm okay. Dear? You're bleeding. Come on, let me go with you. Meldie? I'll leave you for a bit. I'll take her to the clinic. Come on. Yes? Laundry delivery, ma'am. Thanks. Jacob already paid for this, right? My boyfriend, the police officer. Yes, ma'am. Okay then. Thanks. Okay, ma'am. - Miss. - Yes? Sorry. Do you know of a housekeeper? A house cleaner. I have an important meeting and I need help. I'll do it, ma'am. It's my day-off anyway. You sure? Yes, ma'am. All right. Come in. I'm so embarrassed asking you to do this for me. This is where you left off? I'll take it from here. Yes. Wanna come with me first so I can show you what needs cleaning? - Let's go? - Okay, ma'am. Come here. There are no more cleansers in the kitchen. But there's more right here. Why do you have so many of those? I'm being sponsored by this product. I'm a quick bright beauty. They keep sending me bottles. You can take some for your laundry shop if you like. Like their page, too. Hashtag quick bright! Wow, you have hydrochloric acid, too? - Yes. - Also a sponsor? Yeah. Well, I gotta get dressed. Here you go. - Okay, got it. - Okay. All done, Meldie? Ma'am, I made you some coffee. Thank you. Oh, hey, good job. Where's your coffee? I don't drink coffee. Thank you. I wouldn't have finished cleaning if not for you. No problem, ma'am. I'm almost always doing a shoot so I'm neglecting the condo. I want to be you. I want to be like you. An actress. I'm not an actress. Not yet. Just supporting roles. You'll get your break, ma'am. You're on very close terms with your talent agent, aren't you? Huh? I mean... I'm sure your talent agent will take good care of you. You seem like you're very nice to him. Am I right? You're doing everything he asks you to. So I believe you'll become famous. Your name and face will be on every news. You'll be famous, ma'am. Thank you. And... Don't call me "ma'am." Call me Celine. Ah, I'm gonna be late. Here's for your trouble. Thank you, ma'am. Sorry, are we running late? We're still good. There are other talents waiting there. We still have time. Okay, then. Let's do this later. We'll be late. Okay. - Let's go? - Let's go. I thought you said you loved Jacob? I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. We didn't expect it. It's so sudden, how about me? What happened to her? To Carly? She had a severe infection. We don't even know where she got it from. What about her child, what happened to it? Her child? She meant your children, Carly's siblings? How are they taking it? They're in shock, too. Her sister had to fly back from London. I should go. Are you okay, young lady? It only hurts the first time. Open your legs. Doc, do you know a Carly Alejandro? Why do you ask? She's my bestfriend. She died last week. Isn't that because of you? Dear, every girl comes to my clinic of their own accord to get rid of their problem. They got themselves pregnant. Why blame it on me? They played with fire, it's their fault. Do you know who's the father? What's with all the ques-- Carly's father couldn't even avenge her. So I did it myself. I can do it anyway. Because he doesn't know the truth about his own daughter. But I know everything. I also know that those damn bullies are nothing but worms once you stand up to them. You know that now, don't you? Putting up a tough front, but they're nothing. But doesn't it feel good? To know there's someone who loves you enough to fight for you? Can you do that? You can do that, right? Ma. - Oh, son! - Where's my clean laundry? We're still going through the queue. Ma, I needed it today! Sorry, son. It's still sitting there. The line's really long. Bullshit. Just make it happen. The line's not my fault. I didn't say it's your fault, son, Whatever. Just wash these, too. Albert! Albert! Breaking News! Another update, folks. Watch yourself out there. Another doctor was found dead yesterday in his clinic. It is suspected that the recent victim is connected to the serial killer who is still at large. And listen here folks, the killer used poison and acid. Let's take extra precautions and tune in for more details when we come back. Hi, Meldie. Hi, sir. Is this for delivery, too? Yes, please. Thank you. How are you doing, sir? Just call me Jacob. Didn't you-- Didn't you say you're assigned to that serial killer case? Yeah, but I might just give it up. Why? I've been working the case for so long, but I still haven't got a lead. I've been neglecting my girlfriend so I think we should go abroad. Our life might be better there. Don't! Huh? Nothing, sir. Looks like you're really busy, Meldie. Nothing wrong with keeping busy, sir. But, Miss Gloria's son keeps dumping more laundry on us. He's leaving all sorts of things in his pocket. What's that? I don't know. He's a med student but he's really messy with his things. I'm scared of him sometimes. He looks like he's up to no good. Isn't that what's on the news these days? About the killings. If I was a gossip, I would suspect him for sure. Good thing I'm not a gossip. Ah, Meldie, can I take a picture? Okay. Meldie, just the box, if that's okay. Thank you. You're welcome, babe. I'm very, very proud of you. I'm very proud of you, babe. Don't ever leave me, babe. Don't leave me, okay? Don't leave me, babe. Don't leave me, Jacob. Bite me, please. I was on my way to deliver it. Thanks, Meldie. Hey, how's it going? Take care. Hello? Yes. Yes. I'm on my way. I told you, he won't be back till next week. Hi. I managed to secure three endorsements for you.
