Dear Karla, This is to inform you that, having served 8 years of your 12-year term, you are now eligible for parole. In connection with this eligibility you are to be transferred to this facility for extended evaluation, at the end of which it will be my responsibility to recommend you for or against parole. Karla, it is essential that you approach this evaluation in a spirit of complete openness and truthfulness in all matters - just as it will be indispensable for me to keep an open mind. Hello, Karla. Hi, Dr. Arnold. You look well. Thank you. I feel good. I got my university degree, you know... just last month. Congratulations. Getting a degree while in prison - that's quite an accomplishment. Do you mind if I smoke? Helps me relax. Make yourself at home. I brought my pajamas. Mmhmm. So... what do you want to talk about? Looking at these pictures... how do you feel about seeing them now? I don't know. That's cute. God, he wasso beautiful. But it was more than that, you know. He was a musician, composer. He had these passionate dreams about becoming a film maker. He had a great job. He was smart. He was living the life I always dreamed of. That was when you first met him? Mmhmm. Yeah, I was... 18. And, uh, my friend Peggy - my friend from work - and I. We were at this convention in Toronto. We were staying at a hotel. We were in the restaurant hanging out and we were on the lookout for guys. Peggy, turn around. Oh my God, he's so cute. Oh. When I first saw Paul, I don't know, I know it sounds naive, but I knew right then, I was gonna marry him. Are they coming over here? He was just so perfect. You ladies mind if we join you? Sure. Sit down. OK. Hi. Excuse me. I'm Karla. This is my friend, Peggy. Hi, Peggy. I'm Paul Bernardo, my buddy, Nick. Hi, Nick. Where you girls staying? Here at the hotel. Oh. We're here for the veterinarian convention. Maybe that's why you're bringing out the animal in me. Oh my God! I like that. Whoo! Come on! Umm... Oh... Jesus, man. Hey, you don't like it, don't watch. Oh my God. You're beautiful. I love you. Doesn't this strike you as a little risque? Having sex with a hot looking guy? In front of friends? You should try it, doc. It livens things up. Look, you have to remember he was older. Mmhmm.. I wanted to show him that I was ready for him. But you are the one who introduced him to certain types of sexual playing. I know what you're talking about. It's no big deal. Tell me more. All right. That was at home. It was the first time I brought him there. And yeah, I had a little surprise for him. What is that? Shut up. Put these on me. Put 'em on? Yeah. I want you to fuck me. You want me to fuck you? Yeah. What if I were a rapist? That'd be cool. Yeah? Put it inside. Paul said, "What if I were a rapist?" And you responded, "Oh, that'd be cool?" Come on, doc, don't tell me you've never heard of talking dirty. And that's all it was? That's all it was to me. It was fuck talk. People do it all the time. He also says that your relationship is what set him off... made him start raping. That's bullshit. He was raping girls before we met. You didn't know that. Look, Paul lived two hours away from me. I only saw him on the weekends. In between I don't know what he did. He only talked to me about his job and his music and his film ideas. Shut up! Stop it! Shut up! And you didn't know he was a suspect in the Scarborough rapes. No. I knew there was some argument about a sketch that looked like him in the paper. It was years before I found out more than that. So you didn't know that he had actually been called in for questioning? Not until much later. Hey, Gus, check out, uh, the Sun. It's, uh, Paul. He's on the front page. I haven't seen the paper. Well you gotta check it out. I mean, it's Paul. There's a picture of the Scarborough rapist. But it wasn't just Nick. Lots of people saw the resemblance. Guys, this is worse than a job interview. Well, after all the calls, we had to follow up. We had no choice. Yeah, I understand. Everybody's been kidding me about that picture in the paper. Uh, I don't know what to tell you. I love women. I'm engaged to a beautiful girl over in St. Catharines. I would just, uh, never do anything like this. So would you mind providing a blood sample for us? Just so we can eliminate you from the other suspects. Yeah, of course. Anything you like. Then I'm sure everything will be fine. Karla, we haven't spoken of this before. And I know it's difficult for you, but as the psychiatrist evaluating for parole, I would like to talk to you about your sister, Tammy. Do you think you're ready to do that? Sure. Why not? Paul says you became jealous of Tammy. I wasn't. He had this thing about her because she was a virgin. He was disappointed I wasn't a virgin when we met. He wanted something pure. And Tammy was pure? Maybe to him. They became quite close then? Mmhmm. It didn't bother you? No. Karla, I must caution you. I can't recommend you for parole unless you're truthful with me. I don't understand. The time they came home late from shopping? Your jealousy is well documented. End of summer in 1990? Go inside! GO INSIDE!! You've been gone for eight hours. So? So? Did you FUCK HER? Jesus! No, I didn't fuck her. She's still a virgin, OK? She's a slut. I know you want her, Paul. Just admit it. OK. Hey, so what? Karla, so what? I want her. I love you. You're the one I love. That's what matters. We're engaged Paul. Yeah. Are you gona marry me? Baby, of course I am. I love you, too. I love you so much. It's too much. Shh. It's never too much. So needy, Karla. Were you truly afraid of losing him to Tammy? Doc, you're making me feel like I want some Demerol here. Want some? No. We're finished here. OK, doctor. It's all right, Karla. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll talk about Tammy when you're rested. OK. Bye. I remember your liking Chocolates. You love me, right Kar? You're my king. What if your king wants something very precious? What if the king wants a virgin? The king is the king. But what if the virgin doesn't agree? She doesn't even have to know. You're talking about Tammy, Paul. I don't know. Come on, Kar. This would make us so close... forever. Paul. Think about it. Think about where you work. It's a fucking veterinary clinic. They've got medicine there. You know what I'm talking about. No, Paul. I don't. Yeah you do, Kar. That shit that they use when they operate on dogs and cats. You told me about it - halothane. That's for animals. It's not gonna hurt her, Kar. Come on, Kar. This is what they king wants. You'll do that for me, won't you? Kar... I'm your king. It would make a great Christmas present for me. Come on, we can't just keep putting it off. Baby, not today. We just had our engagement party, for God's sake. Karla, we have a deal. Everything's ready, right? That's a good girl. See? That's my good girl. And there we have the beautiful baby sister Tammy. You're on daiquiri number-- what is that? One? Two? Three? What is it? Are there supposed to be two of you? Uh oh, is baby doll a little drunk? What do you think? Is baby doll a little drunk? Sure looks that way. All right, what I wanna know, Tammy, is are you in the Christmas cheer? Oh, that's so cute! Do that again! Ah, so sweet! She's so fucking hot. Here you go. Drink this. Oh, this is so good. She should have been out an hour ago. Don't use too much. Don't worry. It's not gonna hurt her. I love you, Paul. I love you, too, baby... more than you know. Really? Really. Here baby doll... try that. Finally. Check her. Make sure. OK, get it. What? Get it! Get the rag. Get the stuff. Get it! Oh, baby, you are so amazing to give me this. I love you. OK, do it. Come on, do it. I love you, Paul. Yeah, I know you do, baby. Put it on her face. Yeah, yeah. That's sweet, isn't it? Isn't that sweet? Hey! I asked you a question. Yeah, baby. It's really, really sweet. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Take off your clothes. What? Take off your clothes. We said-- Just do it. Just do it. OK... Now suck her. Come on. Suck her breast right there. You're not doing it. I did. Do it. No. Just do it. Paul, please hurry up. Do it. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. I can't. Yes, you can. I can't. You fucking slut. You fucking-- fucking ruined my movie. Don't you ever fucking do that again, you understand me? I'm sorry. Oh shit! What? Oh, my God! She's not breathing! You're fucking kidding me. Paul, she's not fucking breathing! Fuck you, Karla. What the fuck did you do, Karla? how may I help you? Hello? This is 61 Dundonald St. I need you to send someone. My little sister stopped breathing. That was 61? Yes, 61! You need to send someone! The paramedics are on their way ma'am. Go clean the shit out of the other room. I'll finish this. Fuck! WAKE THE FUCK UP! Fuuckkk. OK... this is gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. I'm not getting a pulse. Are you getting anything? Why don't you two wait outside? We were just sitting downstairs, the three of us, watching a video, and then I guess we dozed off. And then we heard Tammy making this noise. What kind of noise? Kind of like a wheezing, choking, sort of noise. Yeah. She was choking. Mmhmm. Detective Porter. Yes. Yes... I see. OK. I'm very sorry. I'll wait upstairs. But we'll all need to go downtown now. Where's the tape? It's safe. And my letter said, "Dear Tammy, I will hold you in my heart forever. All my love, your big sister, Karla. P.S. I hope you are happy and loved in God's hands." This was sincere? Absolutely. Yet within a few weeks of her death, you were making a movie with Paul - the Tammy movie. Nothing's off limits, Karla. You can tell me what you did - tell me why. Look, we made a lot of movies. He was... He was obsessed with Tammy. I didn't want to lose him. He blamed me for her death. I had to do something. But this time, the movie was your idea. This time, yeah. A bit more to drink... and then I need to relax. It's my mission in life to make you feel good. I watched you while you fucked my little sister. I liked it when you took her virginity. Tomorrow we're going to take this, and we're gonna put it on Tammy's grave because it touched you in your most private places. I didn't give you my virginity, I gave you Tammy's. I love you enough to do that. I did that because I love you... because you're my king. And this satisfied Paul? For a little while, maybe. There was a lot going on with him at this point. He had just lost his job. His mother had thrown him out of his house so he was living with our family. And he just kept playing that Christmas video of her over and over again. He couldn't let go of it. He made me watch it. He made our friends watch it. Oh, man. You did everything you could, pal. Man, it happened right here. Hey buck up buddy. We'll get you through this, OK? Yeah. I'll tell you what you need to do. You gotta get back on your feet. I got a proposition for you. You need cash, right? Yeah. Well, I need a partner. What are you talking about? Smuggling cigarettes. It's good for, I don't know, 3 or 4,000 dollars a month. What? All right. Go on, buddy. I think I might be interested. Did it bother you that this was illegal? Well, the money was great. For the first time we could start making our own plans. But it was a little scary. You can go. Woo hooo!! Put 'er here, bro! I can't believe that! He and Nick started making runs across the border a couple times a month. He used the money to rent us this beautiful house in Port de Lucie. It was a dream come true. Paul, I love him! After Tammy, he was, -- I don't know. He was changed. Sometimes he was OK. But then he'd turn nasty. Clean that up. I will. No, I said do it. Do it now. Rar, rar! Hey! What did I just say? You said clean up the mess. Yeah, so you do what I say. I give you this nice, big, beautiful house of your own and you let the dog pee all over it? Come on, Kar. It's not your fault, bud. He'd say he hated me. He didn't care if he hurt me. And this was typical then, in Port De Lucie? Some of the time. But we had good times, too. Hmm. I mean we were free. We were... we were on our own. You really like that, huh? Yeah, I love it! Come here, sexy! There was something else though. Go ahead. You asked when I learned he was raping other girls? It was then, in Port De Lucie. He wasn't hiding it anymore. It was like... Like what? Look - because of Tammy he had the tape. He knew I wasn't going to turn him in. I mean, I couldn't, could I? How many girls? Four or five during that time. I'm not sure. At least four. Don't fucking yell. Hey, babe. Where have you been? I just raped a girl. Took this off of her. I'm gonna burn it. What, babe? I want us to be happy like we used to be. I think you hate me too much for that to happen. I don't hate you, princess. Sometimes you say you do. I know, but... that's when I'm angry. I love you, Paul. We're getting married, aren't we? Come here, baby. Of course we are. Look - I'm gonna go down to Florida with the guys for a week. It'll be my bachelor party. And when I come back... it'll all be good. You sure you'll come back? Of course I'll come back. So Paul left you at home and went to Florida? Mmhmm... for ten days. And what did you do? Nothing. I just thought... Thought about what? Tammy. The girl he raped before he went to Florida. Who he was with in Florida. And how I could keep him interested in me... make him happy. You still wanted that? I wanted him. I needed him. Thank God you're back! I loved him. I missed you. I missed you too, baby. Here. Come on. So... did you have a good time in Florida? Mmhmm. Baby, I'm really tired. Stop it. I fucked a girl named Tracy. Tracy? Mmhmm. If she calls, you tell her you're my sister, OK? You're so bad. And you're really not mad? No... I just want you to be happy. And come home to me. You're amazing. He slept all day, and then that night around 10, he got up and got dressed. I'm goin' out with some friends. I'm gonna take these just in case. He hadn't been with me since before he went to Florida. I wanted to stop him, to scream out and keep him with me. But I couldn't. I didn't know what to say. I forgot my key again! I'm locked out. It's 11:45 now. Are you sure? Yeah. I'll see you at work tomorrow. OK. What are you doing? I live here. Oh. What about you? I was just gonna, uh, break into your neighbor's house. Yeah. Got a cigarette? Yeah. I've got one in the car. So, uh, what's your name? Tina McCarthy. What's yours? Oh, don't worry about that. Shh! Shhhh! Shut Up! Shhh! What is it? I've got somebody downstairs. You just stay here for a while. OK, lets see your smile, see your smile. Say your name for the camera. Tina McCarthy. That's good. OK, where's that smile, Tina? That's right. OK, that's nice. Now I want you to take off your shirt. That's right. Slow, slow. Nice and slow. Keep smilin' We're having fun. Don't hurt me. Keep smiling. That's nice. That's really nice. Hey, babe. Are you sure no one saw you? When? When you brought her. Don't worry. Nobody saw me. I'm taking her up into our bedroom now. I'm tired of being alone. You don't have to be. Come on. Tina. Play time again. I have a little brother named Patrick. I'm really close with him. Please. I really wanna see him. Aww. OK, Tina. I want you to take your clothes off for me again. Yeah, that's what I like to see. That's what I like. Yeah. Tina, how'd you like to have sex with two people? Tell her it's another girl. It's another girl, Tina. OK, you're gonna get a nice big kiss now. A nice big kiss. Keep your eyes shut, sweetie. You're doin' good. You're my little slut, Tina. I just wanna go home and see my brother. Please let me go home. You're being real good. Keep your eyes shut. What you do in the next little while is gonna determine what we do with you. Fuck. I said keep your eyes shut. Fuck. FUCK! Fuck. Karla get over here. Do you want her to identify both of us? Do you want me to go to jail for fucking 25 years? I've gotta-- I've gotta fuckin' kill her. What? I've got no choice - I gotta fucking kill her. Stupid fuckin' bitch. Well, at least give her a sleeping pill or something so she doesn't feel it. It's OK, sweetie. Here, drink this. I wanted you to keep your eyes shut. Oh my God! Shut up, Karla! Oh God! Shut up! Oh my God! Oh my God!! Shut up! Baby, baby. Shhh! What are we gonna do, Paul? We're really tired. Don't try to make any decisions right now. We might do something stupid. OK? OK. You can't just leave her here. Where'd you put her? Root cellar. Take a shower, honey. OK. I had a great idea. Tell me. Cement. Cement? Yeah, we'll put the body in cement. I figure we'll cut it up in eight little pieces, eight little blocks. Easy. I couldn't do that. Yeah you could, Karla, and you will if I tell you to. Paul, I'm not doing that. Fuck you, Karla. No, fuck you Paul! I couldn't believe how light that head was. I just plopped it in the concrete - that's the one with the head. I painted it black cause the hair was kinda stickin' out. Um... when it gets dark I'm gonna need you to help me load up the car. And still you gave no thought to leaving him? I thought about it... but the wedding was two weeks away... and I actually thought it might change him. What about you, Karla? Did what happened change you? I just wanted to get married. "Dear Paul, I love you so much. Once we were an unbeatable team. You and me against the world. I want our love back. Even though we have our problems, I'm still so much in love with you. People think we're the perfect couple. We are. We've just gotten sidetracked. Let's have a fairytale marriage like we're meant to. All my love, Karla." After the wedding you went to Hawaii on your honeymoon. Paul beat the shit out of me. Why? He wanted to get a girl. I didn't. It was our honeymoon, for Christ's sake. But on those honeymoon tapes Paul made, you seem very happy. Of course I did. I knew better than to fuck up his movies. I'd learned that lesson. And on your return you had a conversation with the Czehowiczes - Dan and Molly. Who were they? They were the original owners of the vet clinic. They'd sold it, but Mol and I were still really good friends. They didn't like Paul very much but they loved me... and Buddy. Steve and Becca called. They're gonna come by later and visit. Oh, good. Oh, and they identified the body of that girl they found in the lake. What-- girl in the lake?! Well, you know, the one that was all chopped up and in cement blocks. Paul, are you all right? Yeah, fine, I just slipped. He's OK. He's just tired. OK, that's it. I'm gonna finish this up and we're gonna leave. You two are just too exhausted from that long flight. Bye! What are you doing? That's for acting so fucking stupid just now. Me? You're the one who fell down. I was trying to cover for you! Christ, you should have seen your face. It's a good thing Molly's as stupid as you are. Paul, what are we gonna do? Nothing. It's not like they can trace it to us or anything. Even though he acted calm I think he was really afraid. When Tina's body turned up so quickly, Paul cooled it for a while. One, two, three! And that next winter was a bad one. It was hard for him to find what he wanted... so I guess he felt he had to improvise. Drink, drink, drink, drink. I don't feel so good, guys. I'm gonna go to bed. Can you believe that guy? His wife is upstairs, for God's sake. Jessie! I don't feel so well. I licked every inch of her. Hey, she's too much. You know what she said? She said she's so jealous of Karla that she wants to poison her toothbrush. Your fucking wife is upstairs, man! What are you doing? Whoa! If you treat Karla like that, why not give her to someone who will treat her right, bro? Uh, Doug, you don't fuckin' know anything about my marriage. Yeah, Karla doesn't give a shit. What do you mean she doesn't give a shit? Uh, you are a dumb bitch. You're so fuckin bright you didn't finish high school. You are a dumb, stupid bitch. That's it, you piece of shit! Fucking bastard! Nick, stop it! You don't know shit! Get the fuck outta my house. Get out of our house, Nick. You're a fuckin' idiot man. I helped you. I got you all of this. For you. If I hadn't set you up with those cigarettes. Fuckin' ungrateful bastard. Get the fuck out. We don't want you here. Get the fuck out. Get your bitch outta here. Fuck you. What the fuck was that about? Jesus. The long winter and lying low was eating away at him. He was losing his friends one by one and didn't care. I did though. I wanted him to settle down. "Dear Paul, Tomorrow is good Friday, and then Easter. Do you know what that means? Three glorious days for Karla to spend with her wonderful king." There's a good one. What do you want me to do? Do what we said. Excuse me? Hi. Can you give us directions? Sure! OK, great. We're looking for the Penn Center? You're gonna wanna go down this street, and when you get to the stop sign, take a right-- I'm sorry. I'm so bad with directions! Can you show me on a map? Sure. Thank you! OK, so we're right here? No. You're up one block. You're gonna go back down this street, and when you get to the stop sign-- Shh! Be nice. Take her! Shh! Take her. Let go! Let go of me! Please let go! Shut the fuck up. I'm not afraid to use this. Shut the fuck up. You be quiet. Kar, stay here. Take care of the phone. I want some time with her alone. See that? A little scratch. Ahh, must of happened when we were in the car. You OK, sweetie? You all right? Remember to smile for the camera, OK? Sorry about that. I didn't mean to hurt you. Who's that? My boyfriend Chris. You fucking him? No, I'm a good girl. No, no. You're not a good girl. You're a slut. Say it. I'm a slut. Yeah - you're my little St. Mary's sex slave. You're my master. Yeah. I like this one. Paul! She's missing a shoe! Where's your shoe? It's back - the nightmare. We don't know that yet. Yeah. Parents. Mr. and Mrs. Ross? Yeah. You are my little St. Mary's slut. That's who you are. Say it. Fucking say it. Say it like you did before. We're having a little communication problem here. I want you to talk to me, OK? I know you can talk. Say you love me. I love you, Paul. Say you love me. Come here. Say I love you, Paul. I love you, Paul. I love you, Paul. I love you. Stupid bitch! What the fuck is wrong with you?! Some things are worth dying for. Oh yeah? Who am I? You're a bastard. What? What did you just say? Stupid bitch. You're my master. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said the things I said. I had no right. I should be punished. Yeah, I think you need-- you need to be punished. My little St. Mary's girl needs to be punished. I'll feel better, too. Come here. Who wants me? All the girls in St. Mary's wanna fuck you because you're the most powerful man in the whole world and the most sexiest man in the whole world. Get me some tissue. What's this? What am I supposed to do with that? Huh? Stupid fucking bitch. Stupid fucking bitches. Stupid fuckin' bitch convention. Kar... I'm gonna get something to eat. Don't you try anything. If she tries anything, use that. Does he do that to you often? All the time. Why do you stay? You don't understand. I know all of this... it's not your idea. You don't understand. Our little daughter, she's a good girl. She's never done anything bad. Please, whatever you do, don't hurt her. Get her! Please return her to us. Give her a chance to live her life. I swear, if you do, we'll try to help you out of this. I'm sure inside you're a good person. Please give her back to us. Please. Please. Honey, if you see this.. Don't worry. Oh, come on. We'll find you, I promise. Just be patient, be brave. Hey, listen to this! I wrote this. It's pretty good, huh? I'm gonna take a shower. You know, death is nothin' to be afraid of? I'm not afraid. My parents love me. And Chris loves me. And you can't hurt me. You can't hurt-- What did you feel at that moment, Karla, watching her die? Nothin'. Nothing? I was thinking about how easy it was to kill her. Not like the first time... it was easy. I knew it wasn't gonna stop. Paul says you killed Kaitlyn Ross - beating her with the mallet that he left you. You know that's not true. Many people think it is the truth, Karla. These Toronto detectives think you're the murderer, not Paul. So does the FBI profiler. And the supervisor. Well, fuck them. Is there anything you'd like to add? Karla? I didn't kill anybody. What about Tammy, Karla? FUCK YOU! Green Ribbon Taskforce, formed only a few days ago, have indicated that they now believe the murderer of Kaitlyn Ross may not have been working alone. Police now believe that the murderer and a second man may be working together. Police continue to look for a creme-colored Camaro. Oh yeah, you fucking idiots! You don't know the difference between a Nissan and a Camaro, and Karla's officially a fucking man? That's really fucking bright. What the fuck? Hi. Are you Paul Bernardo? Yeah. Can I help you? Do you wanna come in? We're investigating the death of Kaitlyn Ross. Your name surfaced. Well, I can't say I'm too surprised. I mean this happened before, in Toronto, when they were investigating the Scarborough rapist. You still married, Mr. Bernardo? Yeah. Is your wife home? Nope, she's uh, she's working. Where does she work? St. Catharines Veterinary Clinic. And, uh, what do you do? I'm an accountant. And where do you work? I'm actually between jobs right now. On the afternoon of April 16, that was the Thursday before Easter, do you remember where you were? Hmm... Oh, yeah. I was right here. I was working on my music. Got a little studio right back there. Well, that's about it. Well, let me know if there's anything else I can do to help. Good luck. Fuck. The tapes. They had no idea. I was cool as a cucumber, baby. Cool as a cucumber. Are you sure? Yeah I'm sure. I wish you could have seen it. Mmm. Yo! I'm the cracker rapper, the lady attacker, the coppers think they know me, but the coppers they can't blow me, 'cause the Scarborough raper, that's just the tip of this caper. You're not even smiling. Yeah, I am. No, you're not. Yeah, I am. I'm trying to lighten things up and you're just standing there like a fucking stump. Sorry. Yeah, you are sorry. He was really afraid now that they were on to him. And for me, it just got worse and worse. It came to a head when we were crossing the border in July. OK. You two been going back and forth quite a bit lately. What have you been doing in the U.S.? I'm asking her. Uh, we have friends... they're getting married. I'd like you both to get out of the car. Open the trunk. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Fucking idiot. We could have gone to jail because of you. Fucking stupid fucking bitch! Don't ever fucking do something stupid like that again! What are you doin', bitch? That's really sweet, Kar. Paul! Hello? Molly? Karla, is that you? Are you all right? No. Did he beat you up again? Can you come over? Hold on. We're leaving right now. OK. Fuck you, Kar! Fuck you! You're fat! You're ugly! You're stupid! I fucking hate you!! You stupid fucking cunt. Fuck you, Karla. Get out! Are you OK? Look, it's Molly and Danny, here to rescue the stupid bitch. Get the fuck out! Stay out! Get outta my house! I fucking hate your guts! I'll take these to car. Get the fuck out, Karla! Get the fuck outta my house! Come on, Karla. Let's go. Princess... wait. Princess. Sweetie. Please. Come here just for a second. Don't do it, Karla. I'm calm, see - totally calm. I just need to talk to you for a second. Don't leave like this, please. I-- Come on. Karla. It's OK, Molly. What the fuck do you think you're doing? You can't leave me. I'm leaving. You're fucking insane. I can wreck your life forever. Forever, Kar. I will show your parents the videotape of you killing Tammy, your sister. You think they would welcome you with open arms then? Huh? Do you? Think about it - real fucking hard, Kar. Come on, Karla. Why does it have to be like this? Why can't we just start over? It doesn't, and we can. Kar. Karla? Aww. That's sweet. Come to bed, honey. Come to bed, honey. Please, Paul. Please, Paul? Do you really think you can pull something like that and not have to pay for it, huh? Put these on. What is that? Put them on. Get on your knees, bitch. Arch your back. That's right. You like that. Shut the fuck up. Don't make a fuckin' sound. Yeah... that's right. Shut the fuck... up. Shut... the fuck... up. You wanna fucking die, bitch? You wanna die? Ahh! I'm too fucking nice to you. You know that? I'm too fucking nice to you. You're gonna stay down here tonight... you and Tina McCarthy. What the fuck do you think you're doing, huh? Hello. Is this Molly Czehowicz? Yes. You're Karla's friend, right? Who is this? A friend from the clinic. Karla needs you right now. Here. Oh, my-- I'm OK. You're not OK. The people at work-- I told them I was in a car accident. I have to finish my shift at work, then I have to get a few things from home. Just come with me now. Just come and get me tonight at 9:30. Paul has to go across the border and I'll be alone. I'll be ready. Really, I will. But I wasn't ready. The longer I waited, the more I thought about what he would do to me if I crossed him again. I was terrified. He'll kill me if I leave. No. No, Karla. We'll find you a place that's safe. I promise. He'll find me. We're gonna take you to the hospital, and when you're better... I have a cousin who owns some apartments in Brampton. Paul doesn't know them. OK? OK. Doctor says it's the worst case of spousal abuse he's ever seen. We're going to book him. But he won't be in jail? Well overnight, probably. But that's all. She can get a restraining order if she needs one. Hey, babe! I'm home. Kar? Karla!? Kar? Fuck. They only kept him one night. He was out the next day. So the arrest did no good? Not for me. But I think it renewed their interest in Paul. They rechecked the DNA samples Paul had given them two years earlier. Detective Kirby here. You're not gonna believe this. I have a DNA match with three of the victims of the Scarborough rapes... It's that guy they arrested in St. Catharines. Bernardo? You've got your Scarborough rapist. But they didn't have him. Not yet. Not legally. They needed more evidence. And all they could do was start watching him. Let's put him under 24-hour surveillance, and have a wire tap authorized. I feel like I'm living in a fucking fish bowl. I don't even answer the phone - it's fuckin' tapped. You've gotta get yourself together, man. Get a haircut. Clean up. Get a job, and tell the judge you were wrong for beating Karla. Oh, fuck you, Doug! Listen, man, I'm trying to be your friend. You know, if you're gonna freak out at me and be an asshole, I'll leave. You got it? Sorry, it's just... What? What do you think of Tammy dying? I don't know. I mean... it's kinda weird, I guess. Kinda fucking strange? A 16-year-old girl just dying like that? Yeah. Sixteen-year-old girls don't just fucking die, Doug. Use your fucking head. Karla killed her. And I have it on fucking videotape. She fucking pulled the trigger. You have Karla killing Tammy on videotape? Is it live? Yes! Is it Memorex? Yes! I have it in fucking living color, and I'll tell you what, Doug. If I go down on this fucking assault charge, I'm gonna bring everybody else down with me! Hey take it easy, man. You don't know, Doug, but if you fucking... if you really fucking love somebody, you will do anything to get them back. Even if you have to fucking sink 'em. If she'd come back, I'd love her with all my heart. You understand that anything you say... it's called attorney-client privilege. I can't do anything to hurt you. I can only help you. Now what is it exactly that we're talking about? The murders of Tina McCarthy and Kaityln Ross. You have information about that? I have more than information. I didn't do it, but I was there. If I help, can you get me immunity? Look, why don't you just start at the beginning and tell me everything? How did you feel, Karla, after seeing the attorney? Like for the first time, Paul wasn't controlling me. And it felt really good. I felt like there was this whole world out there - a world I'd forgotten about. It was there again now. It felt great. Hey, beautiful. Wanna dance? OK. Hey, Kar... um... I know this won't sound real good because of the kind of recording it is, and I've been crying and stuff, but... this is for you, pal. I still love you. And... um... I know that I treated you like such shit. I am so... I am so, so sorry. I wish I had made love to you looking you in the face. And I wish... I wish we'd had a kid. I love you, baby. Oh... God! I miss you so much! KARLA! Why, Karla? Why not? Hmm. It felt really good to forget... To grab some happiness again and not let go of it. I mean, I felt like I was... 18 again, before I met Paul... a chance to start over. But you couldn't start over, could you? No... But I tried. Hello. Is this Paul Bernardo of Bayview Lane? Yeah. Who's this? I'd like to tell you about a possible-- Who is this? What do you want? I'm not interested. Police finally made an arrest in the Scarborough rapist case - eight years after the first rape occurred. The man in custody is 28-year-old Paul Bernardo. He was arrested late this afternoon at 57 Bayview, Bernardo's home in St. Catharines, which he rented with a female companion believed to be his wife, Karla Homolka, who is still being sought for police questioning. Oh, my God. Anyone with information regarding Karla Homolka is urged to contact police. We can only hope that this arrest will be the beginning of the final chapter of this story, and that some sense of closure may be brought to those who have lived in terror for so long. I had gone out to get something to eat. When I came back, um, Karla was sitting in the living room, crying. And I ran upstairs... and Kaitlyn was dead. She was... lying there with a cord tied around her neck, and there was blood. Isn't it true that, when alone with her, Kaitlyn became very upset when she saw her father on TV and she tried to escape? And in the ensuing struggle, you hit her with a mallet? In the frenzy, Kaitlyn twisted the noose around her neck and strangled herself? That is a total lie. I have never hit anybody in my life, Mr. Siegel. And when Paul came home, Kaitlyn was dead on the floor? That's a lie. Paul's trying to twist everything so he gets off with the murder of Kaitlyn Ross. But he did it. I know I've done some really terrible things, and I've caused a lot of sadness and sorrow to a lot of people. I'm really sorry about that, and I know that I deserve to be punished. But I didn't kill those girls. They convicted Paul on two counts of murder. They gave him life in prison without the possibility of parole. I plea-bargained and was given 12 years. Victims' rights groups all over Canada protested. They felt the sentence was too light. When will I know the results? The parole board meets in ten days. You think I killed Kaitlyn Ross, don't you? My report addresses what you might or might not do in the future... not what you did or didn't do in the past. Mmhmm. I'm not a psychopath... you know? I'm safer inside anyway. They say that people outside are waiting to kill me when I get out. It's probably just as well this way. Goodbye, Karla. Bye. I know there are people out there who think I killed Kaitlyn Ross and Tina McCarthy. I didn't. But Dr. Arnold was right. I did kill somebody. I killed my little sister. How can anyone ever be forgiven for that? I think about what I did every day. I really do.
