- Brains. I said no, Todd, I told you I'm not ready. But June, I love you. You love me too, don't ya? I guess. Okay, then let's groove. Stop, get off. Did you hear that? Oh come on, June. Go look. - Alright, jeez. It's probably just a raccoon. Todd? What is it? - Brains. Brains. It's this way, stay close. They're everywhere! Worst summer vacation ever. That's not helping, Brad. My God, we're going to die out here. What are those things? Everyone just calm down, we're gonna get out of here. Anything sharp. Maybe we should all stay together, Brad. Go in the other room, Janet. Just trying to help us all get out of here alive. You're not even gonna deny it! Looks like we're all gonna die out here anyway. No sense in lying about it now. I don't believe it. What's that noise? Brad, step away from the window. I found an ax! Split him open! - Come on, let's go! Roll up the window, you guys! Oh my God, they're getting closer! They're getting closer! Get out from under the hood, Brad! Oh my God, they're everywhere. I'm gonna have to hold them off here. Go! Not without Christie. Just go, no matter what you do just keep running, don't look back. I'm not leaving you, please. I'll be okay. Go! I love you. That's my leg! No, no, no! - Brains. Brains. Brains! - Leave my Chad alone! - Christie, no, he's gone! We have to save ourselves! - Brain. - Did you get the plants all covered? All right, that's good. Inside their homes with all doors and windows closed and locked. Please do not attempt to leave your homes until notified by local officials. Further information from state and federal authorities will be broadcast on this and all other emergency broadcast stations. This is the emergency broadcast service. Residents are urged to stay inside their homes with all doors and windows closed and locked. - Hey. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Van, Van, Van, how in the hell? Safe here, man? - Safe as it can be. We should get out of the open though. Got some food and a place to stay. I'll show you where to put the bikes. - Alright. - So you left the road and walked the tracks from there? - Yeah, yeah, we're lucky to even be here. - It was really that bad? - Oh yeah, it was that bad. - You alright? Yeah? That's the first one we've seen in two days. - Well, let's put it out to rest. Come on. Well we can't go north and we'd never make it over the mountains but if we could just get to the river we could float south-- - No, no, no, the river leads right to the cities and the cities are full of 'em. - Yeah but-- - Look, look. We have a stock of food. I think we should just stay here and stick it out. - Stick it out? There were two here today. - Well I don't know where else we can go. - Hey! - Van, Van, Van. Run, run, run! They're coming! Hey, Ryan, they're coming! Come on, hey! Run, run, run, they're coming! - Hurry up, hurry! - Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go, go, go! - All right, I'm jumping. - Benny? Benny, no! - No, no, no. No, no! No! No. - How many times have I told you to stop fucking around with your toys on company time? Fucking girl is late, dude. I'm getting sick and tired of this shit. - What do you want from me? I'm not her fucking father. - No, but you work with her. So either you fix this shit or I'll fucking fix it. You won't like what happens. - Really? Never do. - Excuse me? - How are you gonna fix it? - This is a factory, not a fucking day care. She keeps bringing her own fucking kid in here. I got plenty of single parents that work here so tell her get her shit together or get the fuck out. - Look, I'll talk to her, alright? - You fucking better, now get to work! The fuck are you doing? - Dan, Dan, I just wanted to say thanks, you know, for-- - For covering for you again? - Yes. - Yeah. Look, boss man just bitched me out because you're late again, Janet. Oh shit. - You brought the kid in? - I'm having trouble finding a babysitter. - What happened to the last one? - Well, you know how Dinah can be. A handful. - Yeah, I know. So you think she's better off in here? - I told her to go to the back, she's got her coloring books, what could possibly go wrong? Okay, Dan, honey, what are you doing this weekend? - Not sure, why? - Well, hey, hey, hey, come here, come here. I just got this great horror flick. I think it's your favorite. It's a Romero and I just happen to have a bottle of wine. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Is the mutant gonna be around? - She always will be, Dan. - Yeah, listen, look, look I like you. I like you a lot but I'm really sticking my back out here for you. For you and for Dinah so we're going to have to figure out something to do with her, okay? - Okay, okay. - Break it up you two lovebirds. Janet, you're late! - I'm sorry. - Get to work! Dan, you talk to her? - I was trying to. - Yeah, that looked work related. Anyway, it's time for your break. Go get the crew dinner. - I went yesterday. - Oh. I'm sorry. You did such a great job yesterday that I thought you might go again and you're gonna continue to go until you get your act together! Now move. - Hey, hey, Dan, what's up, man? Foreman's got me getting dinner. - Again? Didn't you do that yesterday? - Yup. - That motherfucker hates you. Shit! What's wrong, you see something? - I thought I might've. You're always talking about the end of the world, well is it here yet? - Maybe. - You and your Romero shit. What the fuck is this? What is this? - Something I made, alright? - You made this, huh? - Yeah, for protection from my Romero shit, alright? - Your Romero shit, man, get the fuck out of here and go get some food. What do you want for dinner? - How about some Fuddruckers? - Again? - Yeah, man. Double cheeseburger, the works! - Fuddruckers it is. Alright, you the man! - Fuck your mother. - You the man, you fucking weirdo. what the fuck? Oh shit! - Hector! Hey Hector, come give me a hand with this crap! Hector! What the fuck? Janet. - No, help me. - I will. Come on, boss man! Motherfucker! Son of a bitch! Die! God damn it, son of a gun! Dan, don't leave me here. Mommy, what's wrong? What are you doing? Mommy, no, no! - Come with me. - Dan, what are we gonna do? - Survive. - Porosa! Porosa! Porosa! - Fen-in, Fen-in, Fen-in. - Okay, right at me, look at me. Hands away, hands away, hands away. - Listen, tell Porosa, tell Porosa. - Porosa's gone, mate, Porosa's gone. - They're changed, they're changed. - Hands away, hands away, Roddy. Okay listen to me, look at me. - Target, target, ow! Target! - Right? Mate, hands away. Roddy! I'm sorry, mate. - You fucking coward! - Respond, need evac now. The vi-tra-tion team, anything. Anybody hear me, please just answer. He's chasing me from every direction. They're out of control, it's too many. Please send some help. Get me out of here. - Alright, we need to find out where that last communication came from so check the zones again. Marshal here, I need all the information you've got on this rookie team. No, you got five minutes, thank you. Alright, I need our team to be prepped, ready to go over the wall, in and out. - That won't be necessary, General. - And what's that supposed to mean? - I shipped the order 20 minutes ago, this is merely a formality. Good morning everyone. Are we online yet? - We have four up, we're waiting for the other two. - Chief, what's going on? Where are they? - Fucked if I know, mate. - Jesus. - From the looks of it, child, female. She's been eaten too. - State the fucking obvious, why don't you? - Alright then, how long has it been since she was eaten? - Well? - Bones are clean, I'd say more than a couple of days. - How the hell would a girl get over here anyway? - I don't think she ever left. Give me a knife. - Oh, what the fuck? - That doesn't make any sense, how could she-- - No, she, it's an act, she's been in there since the wall went up. - It's dogs, right? It couldn't be anything else, it's got to be dogs. - When was the last time you saw an animal go within a hundred yards of a rotter? - We've got tracks. - Wait, step back. Back, I wanna know everything, alright? - I'm on it. - Fuck sake. - That's more like it. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Cool it, cool it. It's good, run! Run! So. Well, they're faster, stronger, more intelligent and they're highly contagious. Oh, now it seems like they have an unlimited food supply. Don't get that. What we got? - It's weak. Picked up a signal of their last broadcast here. - Okay. Chief, what are you doing? - Radio stable base, tell them we need e-vac from that point in 40 minutes. The code is Romeo two, delta two. - Roger. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't be serious. You can't seriously be considering taking us north after what we've just seen. - I am perfectly serious. - What, am I the only person around here with some common sense? Jack, Jack, look, you remember what happened last time we went north. If we go there now and they're like this we'd be breaking every single regulation in the God damn book. - Uh, Chief? - And what would you have us do, eh? - Look, Chief, we've got time. We can get e-vac, we need e-vac now. - Yeah, and what about the rookie. - Oh, fuck the rookies. - Chief! It's not my fault! - We need to get to their radio. - Oh wake up, Chief. It's been 36 hours. Either they're dead or the radio's broken. Either way-- - Either way we still have a reason to go north. - You're crazy. - Tell me about it. Okay, rangers, listen up. We found a trace of that signal four kilometers north of here in the engineers village. We can get in there, we're gonna find 'em and we're gonna get the fuck out of here. - Chief, shouldn't we just get the fuck out of here now? - Shut up, man! - I don't want to lose my balls over some dumb rookies, yeah? - This is our job. - No, our job is to follow the ranks! - What? In 10 years we have never, ever left anyone this side of the wall. We are not about to start now. We go north. Do you hear me? The strange change but are not infected. They go fast and they eat you. - Ma'am, they still haven't checked in yet. - Is tracking still online? - They're heading for 17. - Last time I checked, 17 was still on the black list. Well keep hailing them. - Do you want me to-- - Thank you. - Okay, thank you, ma'am. All dead, I'm the only one left. - Come back! - For fuck's sake. - Playground. - They're stopped. Alright, what's this? - I don't know, it looks like some sort of building complex. Let me find out, hang on. - Get out of my fucking way. Outside, now. Do you think I'm stupid? Do you? Do you think I'm stupid? You might as well have signed their execution orders out there! - Come on, Frank! You know what our objective is! You can't hide behind all this honor bullshit today! - Oh, it's changed, hasn't it? The virus has changed. Now we don't need to lockdown now. - Okay, the rangers are still in there. - Yeah, looking for people who are already dead! - No, that's not what they're there for. - Oh is it? - Okay, just give me an hour. I mean for God's sake, we need those samples. - You have got 20 minutes! - We're here. No tanks! - Fuck's sake. - You shouldn't do that stuff. - Fuck! - Back, check him. - He's clean! - Porosa. - Where are the others? - I'm the only one. - You came all this way and I'm the only one? - Let's get the fuck out of here. Inside, inside. - Fuck! - What the fuck is that? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Spread out, keep it calm. Don't shoot! - Look lively, up there. - Come down, keep quiet. - Matt, check her out. So how many more of you am I gonna have to pull out of this shithole today? - I'm the last one. - Oh, funny, that's what he said. - You! - Alright, alright, enough. - You left us to die! Come here, get off him! - Crazy fucking bitch. - I'm gonna kill you! Get off me! - Now, I don't care what he's done. Nobody is killing nobody until we get to the other side of the wall. Alright? Alright! - Okay. - Got it? - Yeah. - Now, where's your radio? - It's broken, on the roof. - Right, let's go have a look. - No! - Fuck! Fuck. Fuck! - Leave him, he's tired. - Nickel, get his tags, come on. You, get his rifle. Get up. Nickel! Bull, get your rifle! Gunner, this place is gonna be swarming with them in minutes. Nickel! We need to get underground with that radio, find a door. - Got it. - Move! Smoke. Bull, hand me that radio, man. - Right, we've got two exits. One from the north and one from the east. - Alright, split up, check them both. - This way. - What's this way? - Well according to the map, the factory floor and then outside. - How the fuck should I know why they're so fucking fast all of a sudden, fuck! And you don't have any samples? - No, funnily enough, all of our samples are with the cam officer who is fucking dead! Did you retrieve them? - My friend shot himself in the face while we were being chased by dozens of these things. Jack, we have to ascertain how the new virus is spread. - What? Is it airborne, waterborn? You know we can't just march in. - I don't know, Drew was infected by blood contact. How many times, I could explain all of this back at base. Stay where you are. We'll send someone to you. - Not the east. - North end, move, go! - Is It safe? - No, it fucking isn't. - Is it clear? - It's clear, boss. - Go, go, come on! - They're just a liability now. Give me your headset, bring up the course. Get me the evidence. Marshal here, I need escort. They're sending over the course right now. Good, how long till they get there? - So how long till they get it? - They're not coming, are they? - I didn't say that. - Fuck! It's okay Chief, it's up and down. - They saw us. - They saw me. - Hey, stand the fuck down. - We could die here. We get away. We don't need anybody else to die on this fucking mission because of this stupid bitch! - Don't be a wanker all your life, Scott. Send for HQ. - Yeah and how do we get back to HQ? - Thank God we're safe. - You send helicopters to save people, girl, you don't send jets. - Back down the flight of stairs, it'll be safer there. - Right, go, get up. - We're gonna survive this. Alright, we're gonna get over that fucking wall and we're not gonna do it because it's our job or because they say so or because I fucking say so. Alright? We're gonna do it because if we didn't then Drew died for nothing so you can curl up in this shithole and die like a little bitch! Now move! Go! Go! Base, this is Charlie three from Porosa, confirmation of successful visual run. I'm seeing a lot of population on the ground still though. I might recommend taking out some of the larger structures. Okay, standby pilot. Pilot, you are cleared to make a second run. Thank you, base. Starting second run through. - They're triggering the wall. - Then let's get back to work, people! Getting closer. They can't keep up, their running goes twice as fast. - Then let's worry about those beacons first. Run the exodus script. Look at me, look at me! There's not gonna be a reinfection on my watch so just do it! - No! - Run! - No! - Don't fucking move! Don't shoot, don't shoot. - Who are you? - I was just going-- - I said don't fucking move! - What the hell? Everyone's dead, where did you come from? - Me? Where'd you come from? Are you infected? - No, I-- - How old is that bite? - Look, I've been bit several times. I don't know why but I think I'm immune. Just put the gun down and let me explain. I was first bit by my boyfriend. He kept going, he wouldn't stop. I had, anyway, I didn't turn then and I've been bit three times since. Aside from all the blood, bleeding, no problems. - How is that even possible? - I don't know, all I know is that I was the only one left, first guy I find tries to blow my head off. - Sorry about that. It's crazy times, you know? - Tell me about it. - You got any food? - Yeah, be my guest. What are you doing? - Leaving, we gotta keep on moving. - Why would we do that? - You haven't noticed they keep finding us every couple days? I'm pretty sure they charge us by smell. You know, as the only other living person, you sure have a pretty shitty survival instinct. I am out of here. - You know you should probably trust me on this and I think we should stay here. - Fine, but we need food. I lost mine, you only have enough for one person. Let's try this place. I don't know why you're being so picky. Oh shit! Nice shot. - Oh, that's sweet. - Grab your gear, we're out of here. I just heard a gunshot. - Yo, we are definitely not getting out this way so head back the other way. - Shit, now what? - Okay, hold on. Okay, go, go, go! - Shoot it! Shoot it! Oh God! - Don't worry, there's a car back at the house. - So what, nothing works. - There's food, first aid kit. Get in the car! - Where are we going? - Don't worry, I know just the place. - Do you really think we're going to be okay? - Trust me, no one's gonna be able to find us, see us, touch us, smell us, anything out here. How you doing? - Zombie apocalypse, I'm missing a couple fingers and I gotta take a piss, how do you think I'm doing? - I can help you with one of those things. - Can't do it. - Can't do it? - I don't feel safe here, let's go. So, I wonder how long we'll actually be safe out here. - Oh don't worry, I'm sure I'll be just fine. - What? - Yeah, immunity is confirmed. Got lots of blood samples. Get out here right away. Bag her and tag her, boys. Oh, don't forget to put her on ice. This girl's got the most important blood in the world. - Jackie? Sweetheart, it's David. Jackie? I went shopping, Jackie. I got all the stuff you like. Jackie, sweetheart. It's David. Do you remember me today? Is anything coming back, anything? I had to go to a different butcher shop than before. The old butcher must know why I was always buying cow legs. I was afraid he was gonna report me to the police. I didn't want them taking you away. The police have about a dozen zom-- people like you at the abandoned gas station on 72. I think one of them was George McIntyre. It looked like him but can't be sure. Sally's been asking about you, wondering when she, you remember Sally, our little girl? We took this picture last June at Mon-zee Adventure Park, remember? She wanted to go on the roller coaster but you thought she'd be too scared to do it. Turned out you screamed more than she did. Sally really misses her Mommy. She misses you so badly. This month she's turning eight. She told me the only thing she wants for her birthday is to see you and I told her she could when you got better. I read the doctors in Germany may have a cure. They're still testing it but if it works everyone's going to get it. Jackie, please. Try to remember. Just try a little. I know that you're in there. Sweetheart, I was only able to get one today. Just, Jackie please, try to remember. Jackie, don't do this. You're gonna hurt yourself! Sweetheart please, I am doing this because I love you! Jackie, don't! Jackie, no. Jackie, don't make me shoot! Jackie! - Daddy?
