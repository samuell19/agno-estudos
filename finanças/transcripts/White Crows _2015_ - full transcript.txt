How come I get harassed every time I get to the fucking airport? Profiling because you're an Italian man named Don? Shut up! Maybe it's because you actually are involved in organized crime. We gotta follow that limo! - Yes Sir! - Shut up! When do we arrive at the crib? Or do we go straight to the studio? Stop it, they're watching you. Of course they are looking at me. I am the muckety-muck of a big, important movie now. Muckety-muck? Muckety-muck, big pimping, mothafucka, boss, diva, the shit. Got it? I don't know where we're going. Hello? What do you mean?

Hey pig dropping! Why are we turning? You're suppose to stay on the road! There's a detour. They're always working on the roads but they never get any better. You know? Yeah. Okay, now why are we stopping? A construction worker has stopped us. He wants us to get out of the car. Nobody's getting out of the car. Don't worry girls. It's okay, it's alright. Turn the car around and get us the hell out of here now. Shit. [gunshots] [screams] [gunshots] Did you die on me? [screaming continues] Shit! Please. I thought I was in heaven. I thought I was in heaven until you popped that bubble. What time is it? I have to be on time for audition. This is all your fault! My fault? You... You got us in wrong car and kicked out in middle of nowhere! Leave her alone, Natasha. She just thought it was a pick up for the movie. Why would movie pick her? She is not 'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One' material! No? No! I'm definitely not in heaven. If we miss the audition, it will be your bad, yo. You are the one who got us involved with that Don Carlo thug! Puto. Only because your dog ran in first class and bit his ankle! Where are you going? See where we are. But there could be murderers right outside that door. I hope there are. Walk out there, bitch! If they wanted us dead we would be dead already. Wow. She actually makes a good point here. Whoah!

[gasping] [shushing] [whispering] It's me, it's just me. Okay? Who else would they cap? The last thing I did was call her a bitch and say I hope there is a murderer out there. We have to get out of here. Let's go! We're only a floor up. Rip this into strips. You need to stay here! You are going without me? Oh, Natasha! We thought you was wacked! Just as you wanted! You leave me for dead? Fine. Go! Are you kidding? No. Okay. Okay. Stay here with murderers instead of coming with us. Stay. Okay coming. But I am still not talking to her. Let's go.

No Natasha, I checked the whole room. Are you sure it's not here? Yes. It probably got left in Don Carlo's car. There was a drive by shooting in Los Angeles tonight. Two victims found death inside a limousine. Investigators say it may or it may not be a gang related incident. A dead end! Maybe not. I think I saw this girl and two others arriving at LAX from the same airplane as Don Carlo. Go to the airlines, and find out who she was sitting with. Let's go. Just jump! Natasha, we both jump on the count of three. Okay. One... Two... [screaming] No, no, no... Hey! Go go go! Oh God, he's gonna kill me. Okay, unless. [screaming] Stop! Why are you not stopping?

And you both will go to hell! You go to hell, join Marilyn Monroe there. What you say? You just said that Marylin in hell? What did you say right now? Marilyn in the hell? This is you in the hell! Where are you going? Stop it! I have to go and then never see you again. Except at the audition. Where I will crush you. There is one problem with your plan. What is the problem with my plan? It is stupid. Are you calling me stupid, stupid? You go back and give him that card and he will wack you Natasha. - Stop it! - She's right.

If you can help me get to the hospital. How can you help us get out of here? I have a car. Okay, just take that. Just don't get rolled in. Anya! One more month and I would have had a company car.

Who is the stupid one now? It's still you. Sorry-- Uhh, Herman. Sorry, Herman. I didn't mean to smother you. No, it's okay. I kind of liked it. It doesn't start. If I miss audition it's just because you both can't drive! You are more worried about your audition when they are trying to kill us? You're stupider than Lalya! Oh God, I can't stand this car. Anya! She ran off again! You can't leave us here! Looks like she can! Ow! You can't leave me here. Looks like we can. But im dying. You are not dying. Even if I'm not, which I am, if they catch me here without you guys, they will kill me. Oh shit No, not my dress! Ha, ha! To you I'm on the safe place and they will catch you. How did you--?

Did you see that? How sexy wind made me? I didn't even try. Sorry. I must have missed it. How could you miss sexy like Marilyn Monroe. Stop! Oh, I can not believe you just stopped for this vag bag. I told you I was with a woman one time just to see what it was like and I would never do it again, honey. Don't you honey me, slut. Sammy, look at her. She's obviously in trouble, looking like Lindsay Lohan dressed up like Marilyn Monroe, after she was found dead. Dolboeb! Hey girl, you should not be out here dressed like that. You obviously need help. We need help. He's cute. Cute? Look at his leg, OMG! Oh my God, his bone's pointing at me. Oh, you would like his bone to point at you, now wouldn't you Sammy? We have to help him. - No, no, no. - Yes. I am not getting that on my upholstery. Stevie, Stevie... we have to help them! - We have to help them. - No way. - Go back. - And you think he's cute. We sacrifice! We sacrifice! [in unison] By the strength of Acaat! A cat? What cat? To honor Hunab Ku! We Sacrifice! Sacrifice? No! Why? Would someone gag her? Please! Why would you sacrifice me? I haven't done anything. It's not about what you've done deary, its about what the Mayan gods will do. We were going out to find a sacrifice to protect ourselves from the devastation and the disasters predicted by the Mayan calendar that ended in 2012. But 2012 came and there was no disaster. Do not interrupt me!! Besides if 2012 came and went as you say, why would the gods deliver a perfect sacrifice to our door step? Oh deary don't worry. It's just a little blood letting and decapitation. That man needs our help! And you think he's cute? Yeah he's cute! You have the audacity to get on to me about the one time I was with a woman and then tell me you think another man is cute? No, no way. I'm definitely not going back! Go back now. Speed it up. By the strength of a cat! What? What? Sammy? OMG That tire is fucked! Maybe I can blow some air back into it. Fuck! Generic's. Sammy! Maybe someone can help us in there. In that creepy old house? I have an idea. You go over there and see if anybody can help us, and I'm gonna try to blow some air back into that tire. S...S...Stevie... By the strength of Acaat. To honor Hunab Ku. Hunab Ku! Oh I don't know, I kinda like it with this whole antebellum architectural flare. Oh get off it Stevie, this house is neo-eclective and you know it. [doorbell rings] [door knocking] Michael Angelo's Statue of David. Cellulite. Would somneone get the door? [door knocking] Hello. See Stevie, this is karma because you didn't help that cute guy on the road. Could you tell me again just how cute he is? I'm gonna call the police. And he was real cute. Slut. He must have thought you were cute too, with the way he was popping that nasty little boner at you. Oh this is my kind of party. Hey! I'm right here Sammie! Nine-one-one, what's the nature of your emergency? Help! This is not my kind of party! What kind of kinky stuff is this? This is your fault, Stevie! This isn't just karma, it's karmageddon! Do something! They're going to kill us! I want my mommy! I wish my daddy loved me! [screaming] Shut up! We sacrifice! Hey, ese! What you doin' with that señorita? Are you serious right now, holmes? You lookin' to have a fiesta where you're the pinata fool? Baby bye bye bye. Bye bye! That was awesome! I can't believe that fool thought we were gangsters. Jesus! That pinata line--brilliant! Up top. Why don't you back up man. Are you okay? I'm Jesus, this is Jesse, Jorge, and Carlos. - I'm Jesse. - I'm Carlos. I mean, I'm Jorge. Really, you don't know your name? We're the next big boy-band: The Hombres. No man! I don't like that name. The Front Road Fellas! Nah, nah that's too derivative. We should be called For Her Ears Only. What do y'all think? Cool? Hell no. But that's gonna discount our male friends. We're still working on the name, you know? Bubble gum, boys? Yeah! The bubble gum boys. The Bubble Gum Boys? The Bubble Gum Boys. We are The Bubble Gum Boys! [cheering] Hey put that gun down. Put that gun in the glove box with the rest of them. - Yeah, you're right. - Quit pointing it! Idiot. - That's your homeboy. - That's your son, man. Need a ride? Please, promise you'll get me to the hospital. I'll hold my promise. You promise? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Freeze! What are you doing in here? This is a private residence, officers. Did we just bust in on an orgy? This is going to be one of those privacy of your own home cases. No. The broken down car in front, nine-one-one call, cell phone on porch. We had reasonable cause, right? I don't know, but I'm not gonna stand in front a judge on that one again. You've got that one right. Ma'am we're sorry to interrupt. You have a lovely, lovely home. Continue with your orgy. [mumbling through gag] Oh, just to make sure, everyone in here is a consenting adult, right? Oh, certainly, yes. Good, okay. We are not consenting; they're going to sacrifice us! Shut up! Freeze! This is a religious act, officers. Separation of church and state. Does that include human sacrifices? She's confusing me. I don't know. I don't either. Wish we'd paid more attention in training. You got that right. If you like, I can show you our 501[k] paperwork to prove we're all in legitimate, non-profit status. What you think? I don't know. You know my answer. Okay, okay. Okay great. That's all we need. Sorry to interrupt your religious act. What? [mumbling through gags] Have a good night. We sacrifice!! [door knocks] Oh!! What now!! Its just us again. Sorry to interrupt. But its our protocol to take someone back to our captain back to the station. If its not too much trouble of course. Why don't you give me this one, right here, and keep the other two for your religious act. Fine! Sorry to bother you. Happy sacrificing. You are not dying ok? You're not dying. I've lost a lot of blood. - I can't feel my face. - No, you can feel your face. You cant feel your face. You are not dying. He's dead. Sorry. You promised me. I will take you to hospital, And you will take me to my audition! I will take you to hospital! and you will take me to my audition! You promise me. You lied to me. You promise me. I have audition to go. Now that card could have this whole country bankrupt in a month, and you lost the only lead to retrieving it! Are you kidding me? No! Right. A Russian girl, with no I.D., that you think is somewhere in the city. Come on now. We've got APBs out for her and the two girls she arrived with. We contacted the Russian embassy, are running TV ads... also.. Yes ! What do you got? Would you do something about him? He's a hand full. You want another partner? Great! Fantastic! Sir! A Russian girl claiming to be Natasha Zaitseva-- I don't know how to say her last name. But she dropped the dead body off of a Herman Muehler at Cedars-Sinai. She's leaving a trail of dead bodies.

The same team! - Yeah same team. You don't understand! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Anya, Lalya, we... I made it. [Lalya rapping] Is that what they call music? Oh fuck me! [continuous rapping] Uhm, I don't think rap is your style. I think I got a better idea. I think we should pick a slower song. Maybe, uhm, this one? Got it? Yeah. That girl needs Jesus in her life. - She's whack. - Seriously, eh. Alright, eh, we're gonna do this shit alright? [piano plays] We want the money and the tip jar. Come on. What are you waiting for? [singing] [startled] I'm Batman. I can see it. Mommy, can I take a picture with Marilyn Monroe please? Oh sure honey! Let's go. Let's take a picture. - Excuse me? - Yes? Is this you? Natalia Zaitseva is wanted by the FBI for questioning in a double murder Oh my God, Yes. - Yeah. - Oh my God. Look at this. It's me. I'm already famous. I can't believe it. Excuse me. It's not me. Yeah. This is probably some mistake. Put your phone down. Put your phone down. It's not me. I said it's not me. Your feet are so small. Natasha Za-- [stammering] How do you pronounce your last name? Zaitseva. Search her. Guys, this is stupid. You put your masks on in the bar. We all saw your faces. You announced your names after you sang karaoke. Jesse, Jesus, Jorge, - George. - I'm Jesus! Whatever Ok, ok, ok... I got something. The card! Yes! What? What are you doing? Ow! [singing] Hey Georgy, you forgot your bag. We're the bubblegum boys. We're still working on a name, you know. Can I get another pint? You must have got something from them. Nothing! They were just here at the wrong time at the wrong place. They were pawns! Naive girls, here for some audition. 'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One'. What? 'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One'. [knocking] Sir, you told me to report as soon as I finished the analytics on the card. Yeah? Well, I finished the analytics on the card. Yeah, and? Well, first of all, I've never seen anything like it, it's brilliant! Whenever you buy something with it--and you can buy anything you want, there's no limit- -it draws funds directly from the U.S. Treasury at an exponentially growing rate, -it draws funds directly from the U.S. Treasury at an exponentially growing rate, but it does so using an evolving algorithm, but it does so using an evolving algorithm, so two dollars could become two thousand dollars or even two hundred thousand dollars, and then it routes that money through a series, a web of bank accounts. These are average, innocent citizens' bank accounts, you know, These are average, innocent citizens' bank accounts, you know, from lower and middle class people all the way up to millionaires and billionaires-- from lower and middle class people all the way up to millionaires and billionaires-- withdrawing money here, depositing money there-- A the end of the day, somebody could wake up and find they've moved up from the lowerclass to the upper class overnight, or a millionaire could discover he's broke! But in the end, huge pools of U.S. money from each transaction on the card ends up in a completely disguised bank account, or accounts plural. The only chance of finding them is spending money on the card, inputting the original algorithm from the card, and monitoring the U.S. Treasury and banks throughout the nation, knowing the variables of what was spent of course, visible account activity, etcetera, and try to solve for the unknown variables, but that's risky; this card could bankrupt the whole country in like a week. Did either of you just understand what he just said? Did he even breathe during all that? Basically, whenever you use the card, it steals money from the Treasury, scrambles the money through bank accounts throughout the country, and drops it in an untraceable account. Now with the card, we have a chance of discovering where the money goes, but risk bankrupting the whole country in a week. That's essentially right. Ah you know what? There is a tracking device in the card that I may or may not have triggered when scanning it So using the card would most likely draw out the account, or accounts plural, holder in an attempt to retrieve the card. But, I mean, that's also a risky plan, it's like, a trillion dollars could just vanish like that! Oh my God, this card is brilliant. So we use our newly acquired pawns to draw out our criminal. So uhh... Give the girls back the card. Sir, I don't think that's a-- Shut up, Edwards! You chatter too much. Alright. Anya! Natasha. I thought you two were friends. You'll have to pretend that you're friends because you have a new job, working for the FBI. A job? Yes. A job is-- I know what job means. Really? Then why did you ask? What kind of job? Going on a shopping spree. For safe keeping. Beauty salon please. Most expensive one. For two dresses? These two can bankrupt the whole country in a week! This was a bad idea. Lets go! Jorge's cousin just took over Estudios Mexicana. They're looking for actors to turn into big stars. Especially those who know how to sing and dance. So we've been casing that bar for months to get the money to go down there. With that voice, you done become an overnight success. You gotta come with us. I'm supposed to go to audition tonight. We're not really asking. You have to come with us. Oh... Well, I don't go to audition anyway. Why not? Because I do not like what it does to my friendships. But I don't want to go Mexico alone. Alone? Everything's about connections. Forget this town, everything's bottled up. We got the connections that will make you a world famous singer in Mexico. Come on lets just go! You know you want to roll! OK. I'm in. But I have one request.... Girlfriend, you're with us now! Do you think all girls here pretend to be 'Beautiful Russia Girl Number One'? Let's narrow down the competition. Excuse me where the bar is? I think is over there. Thank you. Okay. You're our last two for tonight so let's get this going. What are you doing?

How long you been in L.A.? We came for this audition. Wait wait wait.. You came all the way from Russia for this audition? Actually, I would like to audition for 'Beautiful Russia Girl #2'. [clapping] We've done seen enough. You got the looks, you got the voice. They want us. They want us! That'll be nine hundred fifty dollars and you're both in the film. We pay you? Yeah, this is the way things work in Hollywood nowadays. It's called crowd funding. It's investing in yourself. [laughs] You also get a producer's credit. It's a scam. No, no, no. It's not a scam. We've had the most success we've had today, than any other day. I know. It's like every girl who came in here was drunk. Yeah. Bottom line, we don't need you to make this movie. But if you want to be a part, nine hundred fifty dollars. It is scam! Fine. We're done for the night. Thank you for your time. Wait, wait please. Oh, you're in? Oh, wow. There we go. Let's get that. Thank you. Alright, well that will be 950 dollars each. Comes to 1900 total. Russian woman one and two or Russian woman one and one? One and two. There you go. Alright ladies , welcome to Hollywood!

Your English is not so good. You didn't do that good. Natasha. How does it feel to have a dream? I didn't have a dream. It was all scam. But you didn't know that at first. Yeah, for a moment, you were cast in a movie after going on a shopping spree on Rodeo Drive. Yes, How did that feel? It felt good. But it wasn't worth losing Lalya over. Well I don't know about Lalya, but at least you didn't lose Anya. Yeah, you're right. Friendship can make it through a lot Get your hands off my head! What do you think this is? A bank meltdown today had people all over the U.S. seeing fluctuations in their bank account balances. It is estimated that it will cost the nation just over a trillion dollars in bailouts. Many worry the government's Chinese creditors will call the U.S. on its debt. A trillion dollars? Do you think this is gonna come down on us? Come on! Are you friends with Lalya Saratova? Uh, yes?
