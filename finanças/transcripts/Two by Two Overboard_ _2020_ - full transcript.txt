Dave's log. It's been 147 days since the great flood. And only the animals lucky enough to find a place on the Ark have survived... well, apart from the fish. I mean, if anything, I'd imagine they're delighted with the whole situation. And being amphibious, you might think us Nestrians would abandon ship to explore the big blue, but that's just not in our nature. Our motto has always been: Nestrians never neglect no-one in need! I'm not gonna lie, it hasn't been easy on the Ark. 147 days with no sign of land, but as head chef on the Ark, I'm certainly doing my best to maintain the truce between the carnivores and the herbivores. Believe me, cooking 50,000 meals a day ain't no picnic. Well, hey, at least eating my food takes their minds off eating each other, right? Yes, yes, we've had a few challenges along the way... ...but today, the spirits and hopes of us animals are high. The strongest and bravest of the doves shall be sent out in search of land! Behold, my animal kingdom! And gaze upon our heroic saviour and emissary. On this glorious day, - we are gathered to wish him well... - Shh! ...on his perilous journey! Be safe, my little friend, and return soon with news of pastures green. Lenny! Ooh. Timber! Finny! Leah! Get back here, now! We're so gonna get blamed for this! Hey, guys, what did I miss? ...and then the horse says to the barman, "Why the short face?" That's a good one, isn't it? I've got that crocodile staring at me again this morning. Well, can you blame him with a chef like this? Enjoy. Dave, can I have the key to the food store? Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you want the key to the store for? Are you checking up on me? No, I was just... Hazel, you don't trust me? That's it. You think that I've been holding out on you. You think that I've been hiding the fact from you and all the other animals that we've almost run out of food? Is that what you think? Well, no. I just wanted an apple, but... Dave, is there something you wanna tell me about the food? Lenny! And how may I tickle your taste buds today? What's this one? Same as yesterday. Ugh. And this one? It's a burnt pot of that one. Listen here, Nestrian, when I put you in charge of the food, I expected a lot more than this rancid sludge. The thing is, Lenny... It's Leonard. And if the food doesn't improve, I'm putting Nestrian a l'orange on the menu. Enjoy! The joke's on him. We ran out of fruit weeks ago. We what? Not here. We'll talk later. We shouldn't be up here, we're in enough trouble already. Question. Did our parents tell us not to build a flying machine? No... But I think it was implied. We're in trouble already, so we might as well have some fun. We don't jump until I'm ready, okay? Of course. - Paw promise? - That's not a thing. But it could be. It could be our thing. Never gonna happen. What is it now? What... What if it doesn't work? I thought you Nestrians could build anything? Yeah, but I never built wings before. I'm just worried that... Whoa. No worrying. The last thing we want is you getting scared and burping disgusting blue gas everywhere. Correction, Nestrians don't "get scared and burp blue gas". We emit a malodorous vapor to ward off foes when feeling scared! Whoa! Yeah! It's working! We're flying! Oh, yeah. Mmm. - Huh? - Sorry! Please don't tell my dad! Yeah! Haha, see? What were you worrying about? This! This is what I was worrying about! Bon appétit! Mmm. Pull up, pull up! - I am pulling! - Come on! Pull harder! You both have a lot of growing up to do. How can we? You treat us like kids. You are kids! Then aren't we supposed to have a lot of growing up to do? I think they've got us. This isn't a debate, Dave, we're their parents! And as parents, we're gonna punish you, right? Absolutely! - Well? Go on, then. - Hmm? Oh, me! Sure. Yeah. Er... Not a problem. One punishment coming up. Erm... Ah... - Need some help? - Ba-ba-ba-ba. I've got this. I've got this. Now... No more hang-gliding. Huh? Ever again. - Huh? - What? For the rest of the day. Okay? Good. Now... let's hug this out. Oh, for goodness sake. Until further notice, you will be spending your days and nights in the crow's nest, where you can keep an eye on the horizon for land and we can keep an eye on you. What? That's not fair! You want to be treated like grown-ups? Then start acting like grown-ups. Crow's nest. Now. Wow, what a view! This is the best punishment ever! Ugh! Do you Nestrians always have to be so upbeat? Do you Grymps ever stop complaining? Nope. Speaking of which, I'm hungry. Let's sneak into the food store. Uh-uh. Forget it. We're in enough trouble. Trust me, you don't wanna spend the night with a hungry Grymp. Strange things happen. Wha... What happens? It's not our fault we can't control ourselves... You wanna stick around and find out? Hurry up! You really think they'll be fooled by a couple of straw dummies? Sure they will. This is never gonna work. They don't look anything like us! Whoa! I couldn't quite capture your sulky expression. Hmm. If anything, you look mildly disappointed! They'll do just fine. Leah, what if we get caught? We won't get caught. Because your mom said that we... My mom said we should act like grown-ups. And grown-ups do whatever they want. Which is exactly what we're doing, right? Wow. You are scary good at arguments. Hide! So, what's so important? Erm... I... Well, erm... Hmm? This is all the food we have left? - Uh-huh. - Why didn't you say something? What, to the 50,000 animals lost at sea? What would I say? "If you think you're having fun now, just wait till the food runs out!" How long will it last? About five days. Six if we ask everyone to skip dessert. Which they won't. Please tell me you have a plan. Well, hopefully the Dove will find land before we all starve to death. Huh? In the meantime, I need to make this food go a long, long way. But don't worry, Hazel. Us Nestrians are famous for our problem-solving skills. Thank you! What's that noise? Hang on! I'd already thought of that! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! Crummy craftsmanship! - Finny, look! - Huh? - Come back here! - Stop! - Wait for us! - We're over here! No! Ah... Huh? - Don't leave us! - Nah. Well, you made the food go a long way, all right. All the way to the bottom of the ocean. Huh? "All the way to the bottom of the ocean." I get it. Oh, good one. I needed that. Laughter is so important. Hmm. What are we going to do? We stick to the plan and say nothing to anybody. Especially the kids. The last thing we want is them worrying. Wait! Wait for us! This can't be happening! Oh, no! Wait! It's no use, Finny, they're gone. As soon as they see we're missing, they'll come back for us. Totally. I'm not worried. Me neither. Well, that's Leah and Finny fed. Only 49,998 animals to go. Any ideas on where exactly you're gonna pull their food out of? I told you, I'm working on it. And, hey, the kids could spot land any minute. They're certainly taking their look-out duties seriously. Haven't moved all morning. See? All kids need is a little discipline to keep out of trouble. Ah. I don't think they're coming back. They will. And until then, we'll just have to make the most of it. The most of what? There is no "it"! There's just bloodthirsty sharks and miles and miles of nothing! Okay, what are you doing? Making a hook. What for? For this! - That's incredible! - It was easy, really. I just took a little wood from our raft to make the rod and then plucked a few of my hairs to make the line. I can brush that right out. All right, let's go fishing! É zuppa del giorno, va bene? We're nearly out. And just look at that line! Oh, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse! Relax. All we have to do is convince the animals to eat less. How are you gonna do that? Watch and learn, Hazel, watch and learn. - Next! - Ugh. There's a hair in this. Really? Where? Right there. And it's purple. Just like yours. Pfft! Impossible! I think I'd know if I were missing a hair. Oh! Then again, I can't see my butt from here. Huh? I can keep this up all week. We'll be lucky if the rest lasts until the end of the day. Well, let's stay positive. Hey, for all we know, the Dove's already found land! Leah, Leah, Leah. Fishing is an art. You can't just drop a hook in the water and hope for the best. Huh? I've got something! Really? I never caught anything in my life! I'm sorry! I have tentlecles. Tentcycles. Tent... I'm a bit electricky. - What is that, and can we eat it? - What? Hi! I'm Jelly. Hey! She's a jellyfish, and I'm pretty sure you can't eat them. Oh, you can totally eat jellyfish. Turtles eat us, sharks eat us, and even other jellyfish eat us. And I don't wanna sound big-headed, but I hear that we're delicious. Huh? No, you can't eat her! Ugh. Fine. Throw her overboard. Can't I stay with you guys? - Yes! - No! Please! I got lost in the flood. We got lost too! Isn't that right, Leah? No. She's not staying. Anyway, she needs to be in the water, right? Hmm? Exactly, here you are, some nice cool water. Don't worry, we'd never throw you back into the shark-infested water. Would we? Er, hold on. Where is everyone? I want everyone back in their cabins. There's a... storm coming. I don't feel very well. - Neither do I. - In fact, I feel terrible. This is great! Huh? If everybody's seasick, nobody's eating! The kids! Hold on, everything is going to be okay! I repeat, everything is going to be o... Finny! Oh, no! No! Huh? They're dummies! No, Hazel, we're the dummies. We should never have put them up there! No, dummy, these are dummies! They're dummies? Dave? Mm? Where are the kids? Ah. Finny! Help her, Finny, help her! Leah! Jelly! Huh? Huh? Hmm? Leah? Hmm. Huh? Hey! Wait! Huh? - Anybody know this kid? - I've never seen him before. Do you think that rumour about an Ark could be true? Poor kid, probably trying to escape. Land? La... Land? Land! Finny? Jelly? Huh? Jelly? Oh, no... What's up, Leah? You're alive! Where's Finny? I don't know. - Do you think he's okay? - Er... Of course he is! He's a Nestrian. They're great swimmers and they've got this gross blue gas that scares off predators. - Really? - Oh, yeah. It's disgusting. And besides, this is the only island in a flood. Where else could he be? Right? Huh? Have a seat in the waiting room, the doctor will see you soon. Thank you, madam. Oh, my aching trunk. Nestrians? You're awake! Good. How are you feeling? You're a Nestrian. Yes, dear. And so are you. But... I've never seen another Nestrian. Apart from my dad, I mean. Please stop poking me, dear. Now, was your dad not with you? No, he's still on the Ark! I was with my friends. They're not here? No, you were brought in alone. What? I have to find them! Good day, ma'am. It's the creatures from the sea, they're back! Oh, the masks! They're creepy, right? But they do scare off sharks and most other folks. - Can't be too careful out there. - There's nothing to be afraid of, dear. - Everything all right, nurse? - Everything's fine. Clyde will take you to the leader. She will answer all your questions. It's "Chief Clyde" or "Chief". Okay? Never just "Clyde". Really? Yes, really, "Bridget". Hmm. Ah. Excuse me. Down here, most of us thought the Ark was nothing more than a myth. I've never met a Nestrian who wasn't from the colony. What colony? Ha! What colony? This colony! Ah, seriously, guys? Do you have to move that right now? Hurry up, this dramatic moment won't last forever. This colony! Oh, wow. Don't miss the anniversary party tonight. The Big Trunk band will be playing all your favourite hits. Be there or be square. - Look, Mom, there's a new kid! - Wow! I couldn't have put it better myself. Guys! This place is incredible. Fresh muffins, fresh muffins. Oh! Look at all that food! Come and get them while they're hot! Oh, can we get some candied seagrass, please? We've got the best seaweed in all colonies! - Oh, there he is! - Let's go and ask him! - Were you really on the Ark? - What was it like? Weren't you scared living with all those monsters? Huh? What monsters? News travels fast around here! I'm a monster! Don't eat me! Don't eat me! - Clear the edge! - Mind the edge! - Easy, now! - Easy, easy, and ha! - What's that? - All right! It's for the big celebration tonight. We're making this giant Patch and... No, I don't wanna ruin the surprise. What's a Patch? Patch isn't a "what," she's a "who". Huh? And 50 years ago today, she built this colony as a shelter for all Nestrians. A shelter from what? From the outside world, of course! It's not like us Nestrians didn't try to make a life out there. But no matter where we went or how far we travelled, we were never safe. Even when we discovered our true destiny as sea creatures, danger was never far away. And that's why Patch built this magnificent colony, a secret haven, where we would finally be protected from the outside world. And tonight, we're celebrating her amazing achievement. We're here! Huh? - Wow! - Right! The ceremonial robes are ready. How do I look? Like a mighty, majestic chicken. Can we lose the seagrass? Hmm... I guess. I see our guest has arrived. Hi. Come, come, my child, don't be shy. You're safe now. You've found your way home. Thanks. But I can't stay. I have to find my friends. There are other Nestrians out there? We must organise a search party! No, not Nestrians. Jelly is a jellyfish, and Leah, she's my best friend, is a Grymp. - Hmm? - Your best friend is a Grymp? Oh, boy. Here we go. After we find Jelly and Leah, do you think we can find the Ark too? Didn't you just escape from the Ark? Escape? No, I fell overboard. It wasn't really my fault. I'm hoping I won't be in too much trouble. Anyway, they won't care once they see all the food you guys have here! Young man, I'm afraid we can't help you find your friends, or the Ark. What? Why not? Look at me! I have creatures, just like your friend "the Grymp," to thank for this. I know, but... Then you'll know I built this colony to keep Nestrians safe from those meat-eating beasts. And now you wanna bring them here? Things are different now! - There's a truce on the Ark. - Hmm? And the animals have learned to live together. No chance. It's my job to do what's best for the colony. Fine, I'll find them myself. I'm sorry, child, but we have just one rule here. Stay secret. Stay safe. Stay sweet. That's three rules. And you cannot keep me here. What choice do we have? We can't risk you leading those savages to us. Don't worry, you'll love it here. It's the safest place on Earth! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What was that? What was that? You know, it happens so much these days, we don't even notice any more. Just the colony settling after the flood. You'll get used to it. Now, if you don't mind, I must prepare for the celebrations. Feel free to explore your new home. Oh, by the way, there's a party tonight. That will take your mind off things. Don't let him out of your sight. And I want scouts on the lookout for the Ark and any other intruders. Yes, ma'am. It's just so ridiculous... I mean, we really need to stand together... As if the food wasn't bad enough, now they don't even show up to serve it! All right, calm down. There's probably a perfectly good explanation. There is. They don't care no more. And they put... - Purple butt fuzz in the breakfast? - Mm-hmm. Right, that's it. Okay, okay, I checked the upper deck, I checked the lower deck, I checked the bridge... I even checked the poop deck. Phew-hew-hew! Not a pretty sight. And I can't find them! Any luck here? - Those are Leah's claw marks. - Huh? They must have fallen overboard with all the food! No! Hi, guys. Did he just say all the food is gone? Hey, guys, what did I miss? Oh... Is it getting hotter? Oh, it's definitely getting hotter. And it's making my water hotter. Can you change my water? Ugh. Why do I have to change your water? Because you're the grown-up, right? Ugh! Fine. Whoa. Nice! You know what? I think our luck is changing. Better? Much better. Oh! Hi there! Who are you? Huh? Hide! Ouch. Don't let her get away! I'm right behind you. Come on! Oh oh.. Right, here we go. Huh... Where are you going? Huh? It's the Ark! Hey, did you hear that? Hello! Hey! Over here! I'm over here! Ow! Huh? Ow, my butt! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! My feet! Huh? Lava! Oh, no. What is it? Can you see her? No, but that's the Ark! Oh, no. First we get our butts kicked by the Grymp, then we lose her, and now this! What are you going to tell Clyde? Me? Why do I have to tell him? Erm, if anyone asks, this all happened in a much cooler way, okay? Yeah! Don't worry, I got this. Any final words? - Yeah. - Whoa. See you in smell! Huh? Oh. I'll ask you again. Any final words? Leave this to me. Land. Land ahoy! Nice try. She's right! Land ahoy! Land ahoy! We're saved. Set course for the island! Er... Do you think the kids might be there? Let's find out. Huh? Hey! What are you doing? I don't know who or what you guys are, but you have to let me go! I don't think so. Mama Leah! But my friend needs me! The volcano... I have to get her out of there! A volcano? Your friend is a volcano? No. She's a jellyfish. The jellyfish is a volcano? No. Nobody's a volcano. My friend, a jellyfish, is up there on her own. Oh, I get it. The jellyfish's name is Volcano. Well, I'm glad we cleared that up. But hang on a second. If you're friends with a volcano, you should be careful! You never know when they're gonna go off. You could get covered in jelly or anything! Whoa! Here is a little reminder. Our beloved leader Patch will be attending the party tonight, so make sure your fur is well groomed, - and behave yourselves. - Finny! Yay! Keep coming, keep coming. Loads of room. Well done, sir. Fits like a glove. Over there! A raft! Finny... Leah? Huh? - Finny? - Look at this! Oh, they're alive! And they must be somewhere on this island. Hmm... Not in the mood for dancing, huh? If you were told you'd never see your family or friends again, would you be dancing? Clyde! There's something you need to see. Chief Clyde. I mean, how hard is it to call me Chief Clyde? But you don't understand. This is epic! Okay. This is epic, Chief Clyde. Hmm? Why didn't you say something? Keep an eye on him. And you, don't be such a buzzkill. You must inform Patch at once. Me? Why do I always have to tell her! Hmm. Psst! Psst! Finny! Over here. Huh? Jelly? Erm... Is that a pond? Hmm? This place is amazing! It really is a pond! You're all right! I'm so happy to see you! Yeah! Not again! Where's Leah? Is she okay? No. They took her prisoner! I saw them take her over that rope bridge. Huh? Hmm. Huh? Oh! Candied seaweed! We're under an island? This is great! I'll find Leah, but you have to get out of here. That boy sure likes ponds. Huh? Oh, no. This better be important. I'm missing my own party. You didn't tell her? You'll wanna see this, Your Nestrian-ness. Hmm... Hi! Okay, maybe we got off on the wrong paw. But you guys are Nestrians, right? The friendliest creatures on Earth. You don't cage animals! What do you know about Nestrians? Lots! My best friend is a Nestrian. Do you think she means Finny? You've seen Finny? He's here? Open the door. Your Nestrian-ness, are you sure - that's, er... - Hmm. Let me get that for you. Darn seagrass. Look like a fool... - Is Finny all right? - Back, Grymp! - Hey! - I said, "Back!" It's not safe here. Relax, it's just the colony settling. No, it's a volcano and it's ready to blow. We need to leave this place right now! There may be room on the Ark, but we have to get out of here. You want us to go running into the jaws of your carnivorous friends? Do I look that stupid? Well, you are dressed like a chicken. That's what I said, but it was too late to lose the seagrass. Clam it! You're not going anywhere. But... My friend Jelly is up there. She won't make it on her own. Please! Don't let this key out of your sight. Ugh! You couldn't wash it first? That's my mouth! Er, one more thing, Your High-Nestrian-ness. What now? Erm, it's the Ark. It's landed. I need to address the colony. Erm, I lost the boy. Come on! Here 's an idea. Go find him! Great. Now we're missing the party because of you. Oh. Thanks! Wait, what are you guys doing here? We've come to see... The horrible monster from the Ark. What monster? It's got sharp claws. And huge teeth. And golden stripes on its head. That's no monster, that's my best friend. Do you know where she is? Yeah. It must be around here somewhere. I'm scared. Don't worry, kids, she wouldn't hurt a fly! When I get out of here, I'll crush you all like flies! She is a monster! Leah! Finny! I just knew you were the horrible monster! Wait, I'm the what? It's locked. That old Nestrian lady hid the key in her talking necklace. Patch? Don't worry, I'll get it. Hurry up! We've got to get out of here before that volcano blows! Volcano? We've got a lot of catching up to do. Mm-hmm. - And Finny? - Yeah? It's good to see you. You too. I hope you've all had a wonderful night. And before you go... Open your gift! Open it! I'm afraid there's an important matter I need to discuss first. They really worked very hard on it. - You should probably take a look. - Of course. How exciting. Lower the curtain! Wait for it... Boom! Oh. And you haven't even seen the best part. For years to come, Nestrians can look down upon your magnificent colony from inside the observation butt! Oh! Er... You hate it. She hates it! No, no, no! I love it. Really? She loves it! Did he just say "observation butt"? We're not calling it that. What a lovely, er... gesture. And it warms my heart to see us all together. Rejected by the rest of the animal kingdom... I'll go this way. We built this colony as a safe place where we could flourish and... Whoa! The colony rules! Thank you, madam. And how we have flourished. Proving to ourselves and the world that we don't need anyone else. However, I have just been informed that the Ark, full of hungry animals, has landed on our island. No need to panic. As long as we stay down here, they won't even know we exist. Oh, er, didn't you say they was hungry? Starving! They've been at sea for months. But don't worry, the food on the island will soon run out and they'll have to move on. Shouldn't we help them? Help them? Letting them starve doesn't seem like the Nestrian way. What with the kindness and caring and all? You want to let them in here to share your food? Be my guest! But what do you think they'll be eating when the food runs out? Rocks? No, not rocks. You! Who, me? No. All of you! Exactly. So it's settled. Nobody comes in and nobody goes out. And remember... Stay secret. Stay safe. Stay sweet. That's right, my sweet Nestrians. Now, sleep well, everybody! See you tomorrow for another day in paradise. Double the guards on the exits. The colony is on lockdown. Yes, ma'am! Observation butt... Darn seagrass! - Leah! - Finny! - Leah! - Finny! Leah! Finny! Leah! Finny! Where are you? I don't like this. You look like Mama Leah... ...only bigger. Who said that? And you look like Papa Finny, only purple! You know Finny and Leah? Where are they? - Through that rock. - Huh? Look! Take cover! Is it me or is that tunnel getting longer? Huh? Phew. And it's getting hot out here too, isn't it, huh? Nestrians! - They're the ones who took Leah! - What? No, no, no, no, no, no. We Nestrians are the good guys! Let me talk to them and I will... No talking. We do this the Grymp way. The key! He took the key! Finny? Stop it right there! Guards? - Guards! Guards! - Seriously? Guards! Oh, be careful, Clyde! It's Chief Clyde! Hmm. Ha! Huh? Let's go, we've gotta get out of here! Finny! Mm! Come on. Oh, no! I'm disappointed in you, Finny. Take them to the storage room. I'll inform Patch. - Big mistake! - Let us go! Er... This isn't the way to the storage room. Where are you taking us, buttfuzz? Watch your language, young lady! Mom? Oh, Mom! Hey, we agreed I could do the dramatic reveal! Dad! - And me! - Jelly! I've gotta stop doing that! We're sorry, Mom. About everything. Let's not worry about that now. I knew it! I don't understand it. I distinctly remember ordering those two strangely unfamiliar guards to take them here. What? Oh. Whoa! Look at this place! I know, right? Does that statue have an observation butt? Yup! And it shoots confetti from the trunk! - Nice touch! - Uh-huh. Guys! Come on! What about the volcano? Er, what volcano? Stop right there! And give us back our uniforms! Guards! Seize them! Patch, you have to let us go and warn the other animals! - They're in great danger! - Yeah! Erm... What danger? You disappoint me, Finny. I built this paradise to keep us Nestrians safe from those treacherous creatures. If you keep us here, you haven't built a paradise, you've built a prison. And you built it under a volcano! Erm, what volcano? That's enough about a volcano! Even if it were true, we'd be safer down here than up there with those carnivores. If our time on the Ark has taught us anything, it's... Never ever get into a tickle fight with a hippo. No, Dave. It has taught us that it is possible for us animals to put our differences aside and... No more speeches! Have it your way! Dave, Finny! - Huh? - Grab on! Oh. Finny, come on! Whee! Hold on! Are you out of your mind? It worked, didn't it? Oh, let them go, we'll never catch them now. Erm... about this volcano? Is that what the tremors were? Oh, pull yourselves together. There is no volcano. And even if there were, we're Nestrians, we can always escape to the sea. Of course! You're right, you're right. I hate this. Can we not put towels on the loungers unless we're actually using them? This is not how paradise works. Mmm. Hey, guys, what did I miss? Mmm, Hot tub! Lovely! Jacuzzi! Nice. How did we figure out the whole bubble action? Mmm. Ernest, the usual. Very good, sir. Now, this is an Animal Kingdom. Yes, indeed, sir. Lenny! Leonard! Capt'n! Oh, good! You've found them. Namaste. We've got to evacuate the island! Oh, thank you. Right now! There's a volcano! And it's gonna blow! What are you talking about? It's true! We... What have you done to the Ark? You destroyed the Ark to build a hot tub? No, no, no. We destroyed the Ark to build three hot tubs, a Tiki bar, and... Huh? ...a games room! Ah, it's a work in progress. Relax, have a mocktail! Voilà, sir! A... A mocktail? Are you kidding? Wait, am I getting a hint of cinnamon? You're not listening! There's a volcano right there and it's ready to blow. Nonsense. This is paradise! Huh? Huh? Oh, no! Oh, yeah, I'm beginning to think there's something in that volcano rumour. Your Nestrian-ness! We must evacuate the colony! This is not happening! This is not happening! This is not happening! Er, which way is the emergency exit again? I think it's this way? Let's just go! All right, we rehearsed this! Carry on! This way! Stay calm. That's right. Evacuate through main exit one by one! Oh, no! Look out! The main exit! It's blocked! What now? We have no choice, we'll have to leave by the beach. Initiate emergency evacuation protocol! My fellow Nestrians, our beloved leader, Patch, has initiated the emergency evacuation protocol. Please proceed to your assigned escape route. And remember, the situation is never too dire to give one's neighbour a hug. What about all those savage animals up there? We can only hope Finny was right about the truce with the meat-eaters. We need to get all the Nestrians safely to open water. Yes, ma'am! That means absolutely no contact with the carnivores. - Yes, ma'am! - You don't stop for anything or anyone. - Yes, ma'am! Right away! - Now go! And that's an order! Yes, ma'am! Come on, come on! - Wait for us! - Quickly, children! There you are. Hurry up now, you're the last ones! Patch... Patch! The Ark. You're a Nestrian! Fix it! How? We'd need an army of Nestrians to fix it now! Keep the pace up, everyone. We're almost there! Ah, we're saved! Huh? Nestrians. Wild animals. Wild animals! Okay, everyone, keep moving towards the beach. Nothing to see here. That's it, keep moving. Chief Clyde, we need your help to rebuild the Ark. We need all of you! Er, I have strict orders. But you can't turn your back on us now! The entire animal kingdom is at stake! I'd like to help you, Finny. Really I would. But Patch said that I, er... Er... Er... Ah, yeah, there we go. This is so wrong. Look alive, Nestrians, we've got an Ark to rebuild! Thanks, Chief Clyde. Thanks! You can call me Clyde! All right, everyone, we need to work together as a team. Dave? Okay. Elephants, let's gather up the wood. And we need some vines for binding. Uh, giraffes, I'm looking at you. All right, let's do this. Light as a feather, no problem! Pass it down! - Throw it to me! - Okay! I got it! Oh... My games room. Oh, dear! Huh? Oh, yeah. Finny! Finny! - Primrose needs to tell you something! - What is it? It's Patch! She's still down there! - What? - She... She saved us. But then the statue fell. And... And then... No... Don't even think about it. It's too dangerous. Somebody's gotta go back for her. Then I'm coming too. You'd never survive the swim. Besides, one of us needs to stay behind and take care of Jelly. Hurry back. I will. Paw promise? Paw promise. Don't worry, Jelly, he'll be fi... Huh? Jelly flop! What? No! Come back! Whoo-hoo! Patch! Where are you? Huh? Patch! Patch? Finny. What are you doing here? Nestrians never neglect no-one in need! This was supposed to be our forever home. Now look at it! My life's work is... ...destroyed. We have to leave now! Great! Because I'm really starting to like the sound of this Ark. I don't think I... ...can. Stay with us, Patch. The Nestrians need you! The Nestrians need a strong leader now. They'll be better off... ...without me. That's not true. They need you now more than ever. The Nestrians are gonna have to start again. Do you really think they can build another colony without you? Another colony? Patch. Patch? Wake up, Patch! Wake up, Patch! I... I think... I think she's gone. No... - Finny... - Jelly? Is the old lady asleep? I'm afraid she's not asleep, Jelly. You mean... Come on, Jelly, we have to go! Argh, what is wrong with me? Wait! Ah! Come here, Jelly. Clear! Ouch. Morning, sleepy head. You're alive! You're alive! Very much so. We gotta go. Follow me! No! I can't swim any more. There's no way out for me. Oh, yes, there is! How? In your butt! Huh? Huh? Hold on, everyone! Faster, Finny, faster! I know! But how? What? Jelly! Hit me! Really? Do it, Jelly! Now! You got it! Yay! Whee! Ahh! Here we come! Ha-ha, we made it! Oh, no! This isn't the Ark. Oh, please, come on, let's get this done! Come on! Oh! There you go. All done! Anchors away, Captain! Well done! Quickly now, keep moving. Giraffes, hippos, hyaenas, prairie dogs, check. Boarding complete, Captain! Very well, then let's get out of here! - Wait! We can't leave! - Huh? We have to! The whole island is about to blow! But Finny is still out there! - What? - He went back down to save Patch! And Jelly went after him! Kids. That's got to be... DAVE, HAZEL, AND LEAH: Finny! You go back on board! We'll go and get Finny! - But, I... - Forget it! It's too dangerous! Back soon! Hurry up, we can't wait forever! Hmm... Ah... That should get their attention! I'm sorry, Finny. I truly am. It's not your fault. Oh, but it is. I've been so blinded by my past that I have taken away your future. I should have listened to your friend. Well, why don't you tell her that yourself? Hey! Finny! Jelly! It's Leah! Mama Leah! Jump on! Yeah! It's useless. There is no way through! Same here. - Hey, Mom! - Hey, Dad! There they are! Oh, no! They're coming in hot! We can't wait any longer! Huh? Look! Look, everyone, it's Finny! And is that... Patch? What on earth are they doing up there? They're on fire! I got you! Are all accounted for? Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go! Go! All Nestrians, in position! Ready! Set! Blow! Whoa! - Leah! - Finny! Dad. Huh? Close call. I don't know about you guys, but I think this calls for a... - Group hug! Yay! - No, no, no, no, no! Dave's log, day 173. And welcome to the Ark 2.0! Just when we thought life on the Ark couldn't get any worse... Boom! It couldn't get any better! And all that was needed was a few hundred Nestrians. But it's not just the Ark that's looking better. Now that the Nestrians have taught us all a thing or two about seafood, the menu's not too shabby either. Oh, I'll have another one of those. Ah, this is the life. I have to admit it, Finny, you were right. And you said seagrass wouldn't work on a barbecue. Actually, I meant about life being good on the Ark. Cheers! Oh! Right! Yeah! But the seagrass works too. You disobeyed me. Your orders were not to engage with the wild animals of the Ark, General Clyde. Er, I'm sorry about that. But actually, it's Chie... Wait, what? Really? Hah. A promotion? You showed real leadership. It was the right thing to do. Oh, somebody needs a hug! Aw. Here's your drinks, madame. Two snuggles on the beach. I can't believe that we were in a storm, a shipwreck, a kidnapping, a prison break, a collapsing colony, a submarine, a crash landing, and a huge erupting volcano! That was so much fun! Well, from now on, being sensible is fun. When you ran off on me, I was worried sick! Leah's right. If we're going to be taking care of you, there's got to be some ground rules, young lady. Wow. You know, you two really have grown up a lot. Yeah. Maybe it is time we started treating you like grown-ups. Are you nuts? We don't want to be grown-ups! Ugh. What's with all the pressure? Why can't you just let us be kids? Erm... Okay. Thank you! Oh, excuse me? Two peanut bars and two cocotinis. - Oh! - Your order, madam. - Yum. - Er, can I get an olive in this? Huh? Now, that's what I call service. Wait, it's the Dove! He's back! Does this mean you found land? And we can finally leave the Ark? Well done! Seriously, well done. Very impressive. The thing is, we thought we might just stay on the Ark a little longer. Huh? Aw! That's right, sit down, take a load off. Erm, let me get you a drink! Hey, guys! What did I miss, eh? How long have I journeyed on Just to hear your voice on the wind? Head in the clouds All I see is horizon Thinking aloud That the price to keep my eyes on Was already near... When all around us has come undone Our dreams on hold and our songs unsung We can't go back to what we knew But I stand for hope When I stand with you How can I keep holding on To a dream that's fading away? Searching for home in the wrong direction Never alone with you as my protection There's nothing to fear When all around us has come undone Our dreams on hold and our songs unsung We can't go back to what we knew I stand for hope when I stand with you In times of challenge We'll work as one We walk divided Together we run And now we're building something new I stand for hope when I stand with you Though all around us has come undone There are dreams to share and songs to be sung So hear our voices loud and true We sing for hope when we sing with you Together we'll build something new We stand for hope and we stand With you
