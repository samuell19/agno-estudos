[cycle chain whirring] [footstep approaching] [everyone singing] Won't you come along now, how long will you dance holding your daughter's arm? John... Ohh... John, Hurry up! Everybody must be expecting us at the party. Come on fast! Your momma is jealous. Neither she knows how to dance nor she let us dance! Come on. [she laughs] -Bye, dear. -Bye, darling. Bye, dear. -Eat soon and go to bed early! -Take care. Bye. -Oh, Come on. -Come on, let's go. Bye, mom. Bye, dad. Bye, dear. Who is it? Postman. No... Help! Save me dad. [door opening] Shivaji said... My soul's story To fulfill What say, Gokul? You've had your fill today, haven't you! Still, you not feeling good? One should be happy with whatever one gets. Nothing is possible till the Lord doesn't will it. Today's quota is over. Now what about tomorrow? Why do you worry? Huh, The One, who has given the mouth, will provide the food, too. Supper must be around somewhere. He takes the problems of needy The problems of his devotee And takes them away Hail of the lord You are my moon You are my sun You are the light of my eyes. Good morning. -Mom. -Diya. I won't give it. I won't give it. I won't give it. Oh, diya, Give me the photographs. Diya, give me the photographs. I won't give it. I won't give it. I won't give it. Come on, diya, give me the photographs! -Oh my God. -Stupid. Mom, Mom, look what I got from the bag of Soniya! Her boyfriend's photo! Stupid, idiot. Mom, tell her if she even comes anywhere near my room, I will break your bloody legs. Idiot. Soniya. Diya, come on, sit down! It's 07:20. You're getting late for your school. Stupid fool. Gosh! What kids are they! Naina. Yes, Mother. Listen... Yes, Mother. If I'll ask Sonia, she will create a scene. You are my good child! That... Kabir, is he a nice boy! What do you mean, mom? Of course, he's a nice boy. Listen... she must be telling you all her feelings. Then... Sonia is serious about him or not? Yes, otherwise why would she keep his photograph under her pillow? You know, now I will have to deal with all these things myself. If your father had been living, it would've been a different matter. But now I have to take care of everything, haven't I? Why doesn't Kabir ever discuss about marriage proposal? And what are you doing there? Go and finish the breakfast. Oh, Mom! Relax, mom. He will talk about marriage. Definitely he will. He will...he will! I have been heard it lot of times. After all, what does he intend? His intentions are noble, Mom. But to discuss it with Sonia is not that easy! But if he's ready to marry this overbearing girl then why should he be scared about discussing it? Mom, yes, but... You see... Ask him to close his eyes and tell it to her. Thereafter we will see whatever happens. He will speak, Mom. He will speak soon. In fact, he leaves home everyday by thinking that... whatever it will be, he will surely speak to her today. But the moment he comes in front of Sonia... don't know why... he gets scared. [music playing] Sonia, I... Yes. Sonia will you... Go ahead, sir. Yes, yes. Sir, you can ask for her hand! Yes sir, you can do it. Yes sir, you can do it. You must go, sir. Ask her for it! -Do it, do it, do it. -Stop it, man. They meant to say... that why you don't ask for Miss Sonia's hand. Ask her for it. No, I can't ask. I can't say that to her. I can't say that to her, dear! If I cannot talk about my marriage before her younger sister then how will I talk that in front of that atom bomb? Oh my God. So this is what you've taught Kabir in all the days? And you are supposed to be a great dialogue writer? Sonia, I want to drown myself like a frog in the well of your heart. You write such dialogues? And you, my God, you suppose to be a great acting teacher! And You a music teacher... and you a dancing teacher! All of you together couldn't teach Kabir six simple words? 'I want to marry you.' Sir, the thing is... Get lost from here. Get lost from here. If you are seen here again, I'll send you all to jail. Get out from here. -Out. -Sir, listen to me once... Sir. Get out from here. Kabir, I don't know much about love. But I know my sister Sonia very well. And you don't have to take tuitions about how to talk to her. Tell her your feelings in your own natural style. Because what comes out of the heart makes a direct impact. Yes. [music playing] The Book, all the best. Yahoo. Sister, Sister, Sister, Sister. This... Sister. Shit. Come here. What is it? Kabir has sent it for you. Has he gone mad? Does he not know that I don't like flowers at all? Hmm, you know that. Now just see...the flowers will wither within two minutes, stupid. -Sister! -What is it now? Kabir has sent it. Oh my God, he has gone totally berserk today. He knows I don't like reading. I don't know why does he do it? Sister, please sister, please read it, for my sake. I love you, hmm. Huh. Hold it. Open page number 42. And then the Emperor mustered courage and told Husn Bano, 'Give your consent for marriage at least now, darling!' Huh? Sonia, the reply that Husn Bano gave to the Emperor is found in the eighth book on the sixth rack in the fourth row of the library. If your reply is the same, place this flower on page number 16. Kabir. What's this nonsense? Where's Kabir? Up in the library. I will have to bring that Emperor to his senses. Sister! Oh! I will die. You? What are you doing here? You didn't go up there? It's nice that I didn't go. I don't want to make a fun of myself by being beaten up by a girl in the college in broad daylight. Didn't you see how she went upstairs like a charged engine? Kabir, nobody else knows Sonia better than I do. After all, both of us had been born together. And whenever she screams loudly, she means 'yes'. Just see...in exactly 2 minutes and 25 seconds her temper will cool down. And in the 25th second you will appear before her. And in the 27th second, your love story will be complete. Come on, go now please! Believe me, go. And don't spare Sonia today. Don't let her go home till she says yes. I am following them since yesterday with this. I will deliver it tonight itself. -[doorbell ringing] -Sister! Telegram. Signature. Press it a little bit. I will get another pen. What happened, Naina? Who is it? It is a telegram of Jaya Aunty. She has wished happy birthday to Diya. I see... That... Pintu, your stuff is useless. -Don't say anything about my stuff. -It's not fun. What's this? It has no appeal. I thought it's your's... My stuff is the best. Try it and see for yourself. Naina, Sonia, Naina, Sonia, Naina, Sonia, Naina, Sonia, Naina, Sonia, Naina... [clock clicks] Whatever I get is good enough. Ah, ah. Naina. Where were you, Sister? [whistling] Oh my God. Really? [whistling] You mean that Kabir... -Of course. -Mother. Not now, not now. Kabir will himself speak to her on Diya's birthday party. I've told him clearly that I am not going to cook food. Yes. And after marriage, I won't be able to do any household work. I want the cook, cleaner, driver... all at my disposal. And along with the driver, if I get some cars too... you know, I mean... Opel Astro, Opel Astro Mercedes, Pajero etc. etc. Huh. What happened? Nothing, Sister. It's just that I am not used to living without you. Do you think that I will be able to live without you? Moreover, I am not going to some other country. I will be here only. Just see...even after marriage, I'll be here all day long. With you. And if he wants to find me, he will come after me, I won't go after him. Mumma, Naina, Diya and... Us? Call my name Call my name I'm lost When I got up When I fall asleep I will die If got separated from you Call my name I'm lost When I got up When I fall asleep I will die If got separated from you Call my name I'm lost I started loving you Started loving you I started loving my life Started loving my life I was not scared of dying Now I am getting scared Call my name I'm lost When I got up When I fall asleep I will die If got separated from you Call my name I'm lost Happy birthday. Stay in front of me Don’t go I have to say something to you Don’t go The weather of love Will never return Call my name I'm lost When I got up When I fall asleep I will die If got separated from you [car horn blaring] What's happening? [chattering] Hello, my friend, what happened? What happened? [phone ringing] -Hello. -Where are you? Sister, I'm caught in a traffic jam. Is the cake ready? Yes, madam, a grand cake is ready. How does it taste? How do I know? I haven't tasted it. Then taste it. Take a little from the side. Shall I? Yes. Hurry up. What's the hurry? Sister, hurry up, please. I have been wonderful, Naina. I am unable to believe that I've made this cake! You don't have to be shocked! You don't know my sister. Whenever she does something whole heartedly, nobody in the world can stand in her comparison. Thank you, but shall I tell you a secret? Yes. Sometimes I imagine the craziest of things. That I am in Kabir's home. I am cooking food for him. Oh my God. Really, Sister? And I was happy, Naina. I was happy at home. I mean, can you believe it? Sister! I will tell it to Kabir. Naina, don’t you dare. I will kill you. Just a minute, okay, there's somebody at the door. Sister? Sister? Sister! I am coming, Sister. I am coming. Do you have a phone? -A mobile phone? -No, no. Somebody help me, please! No! Please help me. Do you have a phone? Do you have a phone? I have to call the police, the police. Sister. [crying] Please, please don’t, please, please, please, please, please, please somebody help me, please. -Do you have a phone? -Yes, yes. Please call the police, it's an emergency, someone is beating my sister ruthlessly. Tank Road, Juhu. Ask them to come immediately. Tank Road, Juhu. Somebody help me, please! Sister, I am coming, sister. The police is coming, sister. [Sonia screaming] Hello. Sister. Who's this? Who's this? [music playing] [siren blaring] Yes, sir, inspector Dubey has arrived here. He is making inquiries regarding the girl's murder. Yes, sir, okay, sir. Send these body pieces to the lab. I want a report by this evening. Okay, sir, I will send it right now. And as I will get the report... [car door opening] Naina, what happened, dear? All these people... What happened? Sonia! Excuse me, where are you going? Sonia! Excuse me, madam, nobody can enter inside. This is my home. Sonia... Ah! Mom, Mom, look what has happened to Sonia? Blood is oozing out. Call the doctor. Has any of you called an ambulance or not? What are you looking at my face? Someone call the ambulance. Where is the ACP? This time only...Mother! Mom, what happened, Mother? Somebody...call the doctor! Call the doctor. Is it? Sunanda, Gokul has come. -Hello, Mary. -Gokul. Hi. All right, Sunanda, all right, Gokul, I'm leaving. Okay bye. Bye. You're gossiping here merrily and I was waiting for you outside your quarters since the past one hour. -Give me the keys. -Hey! What happened to you? Nothing. There was a scuffle. At the Post office. Give me the keys. When will you come? It'll take another couple of hours. There's an operation and then the doctor has... All right. All right, I'm going to sleep. Come whenever you feel like. What are you doing, Gokul? I am searching for medicine. How did you come so soon? I have brought medicine for you. I sent Mary to the operation theatre. Why did you take out this scissor, Gokul? To kill you! How many times have I told you to keep your mind cool? You used to break into fights and then I have to face the consequences. You're behaving as if I am your husband. Huh? Huh? If not yet, you will soon be my husband. Is it? Is it? You are behaving as if I am your wife. If not yet, you will soon be mine. [siren blaring] Dubey, I've spoken to the Medical officer. As soon as the ambulance arrives, send the body for post-mortem. Inform me as soon as the finger-print report arrives. [thundering] Sir, she's Sonia Shegal's sister. She's sitting outside the home since evening. She's not ready to go inside the home. I am the ACP Santosh Singh Waalia. I regret it, Naina. Come inside. This time your mother and your younger sister need you desperately. Sonia, my sister, is going to call me again. The line was disconnected while I was speaking to her. She will call me again... yes! I am coming to you My Lord Bless with your blessing Lord It's will not be painful anymore The Lord takes care of us All daylong His name gives us blessing Without him no one's gonna live Keep the life happy my Lord Take all the pain By the grace of Gurunanak The Lord will be graceful By the grace of Gurunanak The Lord will be graceful Sonia! Sonia! [dog barking] Hey, Gokul, listen Gokul! I am speaking from the nursing quarters of the hospital, Sir. The dogs reached here sniffing the murderer. I believe that we would have surely arrested him. But the scoundrel escaped. But, Sir, he did come here. We will surely arrest him sooner or later. All right, Dubey. [music playing] No letters or any news No letters or any news Who knows where you've gone Where you've gone No letters or any news Who knows where you've gone Where you've gone No letters or any news Who knows where you've gone Where you've gone Where you've gone Breaking this heart Who knows where you've gone Where you've gone Now thorns of your memories Are hurting in my heart This pain doesn't rest And these tears don't stop My love is searching you How should I say it Where have u gone? You have one sigh And we never heard it You might have called us When u went All the time this is sadness Where were we Where you've gone No letters or any news Who knows where you've gone Where you've gone Where you've gone Breaking this heart Where have you gone Where have you gone Where have you gone Where have you gone Where have you gone Mom, aunty, aunty look at Vicky, he's pulling my hair. Mom, I wonder where she has hidden my water-bottle. I haven't done anything, Aunty. Vicky is lying. Vicky, Leave Diya and come here and eat food. Look, Naina, I am your Aunty. Whatever I suggest will be in your interest. I still repeat. Come to Nainital with us. You'll feel lighter. What does this girl want, Purnima? Forget Sonia! Look, Naina, we women can do nothing alone. Nobody will support us. Sonia's news will appear on the cover page, and then on the second page, and then from second to fourth and then it will vanish within no time. We can do nothing more than bear with it. It's in the goodness of all of us to forget Sonia. How can you people even talk about forgetting Sonia? Till now, we haven't even know who is her killer? We don't want to find out about the killer or anything. That's the job of the police. Let the police do it. Sonia has died, Naina. We have nothing to do with her killer. The man who raped your daughter, the man who killed your daughter ruthlessly, you've nothing to do with him? Huh? No...I've nothing do with him. Who he is? What he does? Who else will he chase and rape? It makes no difference to me. I value your life much more. I cannot lose you, Naina! Naina. Do you understand? [crying] Naina, Naina. [groaning] [phone ringing] You... Do you want to hear the truth or the lie? The truth. Naina, this city has a face and a soul. The face is very beautiful. And the soul is very frightening. Do you see these files? It contains information about cases which would terrify you. Actually the truth is... we cops too are as helpless as you are. The only difference is that we cannot admit our helplessness. We deeply regret that we haven't been able to find the killer. But... But I promise that the efforts won't be stopped. Inspector Dubey has just returned from Damodar Hospital. If at all, we will find some clue from there. [chattering] Mary, come here, where is Sunanda? Sunanda? She's upstairs. Get lost. Gokul! You pretend that you love me, do you? -[Sunanda screams] -Huh? But when I ask for a loan of 500 rupees loan -from my future wife what am I told? -What? What? -What? -What am I told? -That you don't have money? -Please, no. That you even drink tea just once in a whole day, Gokul! Please, no, no. Then does Lord Rama provide you money from heaven to make ornaments? No! No! How many ornaments have you made? None. Who told you? The jeweller has told me everything. Now will you tell me or... I will tell you. I've made nothing. I've made just this Mangalsutra necklace. Be careful, it will break. Are you mad? Will I damage such an expensive item? In fact, I will sell it off. No, Gokul! You had promised me that you would marry me! Gokul, no. Marriage? With a liar and a deceitful woman like you? Get off. Give me back my necklace, Gokul! Give me back my necklace. I am saying leave me. [Sunanda screams] You don't realise who you are dealing with. I have fixed several girls like you. You are fortunate that you haven't died as yet. If you don't mend your ways, you will face the same fate as the others. [Sunanda grunts] Mom. Sonia. Mom. Where were you, Naina? He has been arrested, Mom. Who? He has been arrested. Yes, he has been arrested, Mother. -What I have done? -Come I will tell you now. -Sir, sir. -Hey, get off. Sir, I was only delivering letters. You've delivered as many letters as you could. -Sir. -Now I will deliver the truth about you... -Sir. -..your letter. Sir, sir. Sister! The never-ending flow of life which has been flowing since eternity. It's the base of every religion to protect it, to respect it. Our world, our society functions on the basis of this very principle. on the basis of this very principle. Sonia Sehgal, who's passion was to laugh, to smile, to live. She was aged just 18 years, 6 months and 3 days when she was killed. On 19th February at 3 o'clock in the afternoon the criminal entered this innocent girl's house and he beat her, raped her and murdered her brutally by crushing her head. Even the police admitted that when they entered the house the scene was so grisly that no body should have to see such a sight. Just imagine what the mother would've experienced when she must've cleaned the floors meared with her daughter's blood, when she must've held various parts of her mangled body in her hands. I am ashamed of calling myself a human being. If a human being can commit such an act. Then on what basis do we claim that we are nature's most superior creation? That we are superior than ants and other insects? If the law would've permitted me I would've asked for only one punishment for this bestial human. That he should be half-buried under the ground on a public road and stoned till the point when he breathes his last out of agony. But the most severe punishment under Indian penal code is hanging till death. He should be hanged. He should be hanged. He should be hanged till death. Now I will present the key witness in this case. Sunanda Tripathy. Sunanda, where have you trapped me? Order, order. Your Honour, this is our domestic quarrel, Sir. I wonder how the police is trying to take advantage out of it What they are planning to do, sir. Order, order. Listen... I had slapped you in anger, didn't I? -You too may slap me if you want to. -Take him out. -Break my all bones by beating. -Order, order. -Don't let me die, Sunanda. -Come on, get in your place. -Don't let me die, Sunanda. -Come on, get in your place. -But don't land me in a soup, Sunanda. -I said be quiet. -Don't let me die, Sunanda. -Be silent in the court. Don't let me die! Your Honour, she wants to marry me! I said keep quiet. I am ready to marry this woman in everybody's presence. -Keep quiet this is court. -Believe me, Sunanda! I am ready to marry to you! But I am not a killer. Mr. Gokul, this is court, not your house. I haven't done anything, your Honour. Sunanda, don't let me die, Sunanda. Mr. Gokul I am warning you for the last time. Believe me, Sunanda, I haven't done anything. -[Gokul cries] -Madam, your witness. Sunanda, you need not be afraid. You just have to repeat in the court what you stated to the police. what you stated to the police. That on the afternoon of the 19th your old lover came to you in a tense state. And a short while later, you saw him hiding blood-stained gloves and weapon. And seven days ago, he bashed you up and threatened you that you would meet the same fate as others. It means, Sunanda, he will kill you! [Gokul cries] Isn't this the truth? [Gokul cries] Sunanda, Tell me, isn't this the truth? Don't be afraid, Sunanda. Sunanda, tell me, isn't this the truth? Sunanda, speak up! No! My Gokul is not a killer. My Gokul hasn't killed anybody. I wonder what I blabbered to the police under this girl's influence. I had turned mad! My Gokul is not a killer. My Gokul hasn't killed anybody. My Gokul cannot be the killer. [Sunanda cries] We will appeal in the High Court. We will go to the Supreme Court! We won't let such a dreadful criminal out in the open. What you should do is... You... Have faith in the law, Madam. Miss Naina, the law's reach is tremendous. Just see, the real criminal will surely be caught some day. I regret that you weren't with your sister that day. Otherwise I would have had double fun! Come. -Take it easy, sir. -Come on, you rascal. The court has just exonerated me. Get off. [Naina cries] [Train's horn blaring] Your beloved darling Sunanda. Here it is, Gokul. Thirty letters, one for the each day. Neither will I be able to write any more letters nor can I live away from you for more number of days. That's enough. These are enough. Now I will open one of your letter every day and read it ten times. Gokul, I wonder how I got influenced by those people. A man who loves me this much why would such a man look at any girl with evil eyes? Gokul, I had gone mad that I assumed you to be the killer. How much farther is your mother's home? We left home at five in the morning. First in the train, then in the bus, and now on foot. Why? Are you tired? How can you say that, Gokul? Can I ever be tired in your company? Look after yourself well when you are away from me. Even if you happen to touch liquor, you will see my dead face. Yes, I will give up my life under the same train in which you've brought me. Come on, let me carry this bag. Give it to me... hand me the trunk. You can assume that you have reached. [Sunanda screams] Gokul, help me! [Sunanda screams] Gokul, help me! See, Miss Naina, we cannot give you Gokul's address. But why, inspector? He has made an application to the court that nobody should be given his address. A man who spit on the face of law, the law is defending the same person? What will you do with his address? Will you search him? Will you chase him? He's a rascal! You shouldn't involve yourself in his matter. You belong to a decent family. Don't involve yourself in this mess. It's for people like us to tackle scoundrels like him. Let us do it. Can you give me a copy of the court judgement? We want to appeal to the High Court that's why. Yes, I can surely give it to you. Be seated in my cabin over there. I will bring it right away. All right. Gokul Pandit, Main Post office, Andheri. How about going for lunch, Mr. Dubey? Carry on. I will join you. [door opening] Miss Naina, here's the official report of the court judgement. Thank you, Mr. Dubey. Let me know if you need anything else. I have got what I wanted. -Thank you. -Your welcome. [girl laughing] [alarm blaring] Father, I've to check many things on a holiday so I get delayed! All right, father I will take a shower and reach in half an hour. Okay, bye. [birds chirping] [fire-alarm blaring] What happened? Who's there? Stop! Stop! Scoundrel! Ah! [cat meows] [Naina groans] [Naina grunting] Scoundrel. [Naina screams] I am sorry. Bhim. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. Please forgive me. Bhim. -Please forgive me. -Bhim Bahadur Singh. I'm coming! -Yes, sir! -Please forgive me. -Take out the gun! -What? -Take out the gun! -Why? Oh. -How dare you question me? -Please forgive me. Please, I... -To shoot you dead! -Ah. Where had you been? I had gone to buy bottle-gourds! Is the bottle-gourds more important or I am more important? -Bottle-gourds! -What? No, you are more important. How many times have I told you not to leave me alone? People dash against me, feel embarrassed and then ask for pardon. If I am blind, how are they to be blamed? Please pardon me. I didn't know that... It's not your fault. It's my fault. I am sorry. -Bhim. -Yes, sir. Kick me twice when I reach home. -Why? -Major Suraj Singh Rathod. How could Major Suraj Singh Rathod doze off despite being an army man! Listen... can I walk with you for a few steps? Why just a few steps? You can walk with me for a long distance too! Thank you. There's my bicycle! Oh my God. The wheel has been blunted. What should I do now? Now Mother will surely get to know. What are you trying to hide? What's the matter? Nothing. I am not hiding anything. I'm fine. I am not hiding anything. Don't tell me if you don't want to. Come, I will escort you to your home. No, I will go on my own. Thank you, thank you. I will go on my own. Wait. I won't let you go alone in this condition. Bhim. -Yes, sir. -Take the bicycle and come along. [Naina sobbing] I am sorry, I am sorry, Major. Your nobility influenced me to such an extent that I told you all about my life. Please forgive me. Miss Naina, the innocence with which you disclosed your wounds to a stranger one needs a lot of courage to do such a thing. You have great strength! Just continue to battle in this manner with your fear and then see how life guides you to your destination. You are a very nice person, Major. And I felt very nice to meet you today. Sometimes one get so much from certain people that one can not even thank the person enough. I don't know why you... Bhim. Yes, sir. Tell the Madam that asking why is strictly prohibited here. It's strictly prohibited! This 'why' has always has sled a lot of people severely. If you question as to why the sky is so expansive, why is the ground spread out under one's feet, why this idiot Bhim is so small, you won't get answers for all these questions. -Bhim. -Yes, sir. -Fetch a taxi! -Why? Why? I have a reply for this 'why'. Because Miss Naina will be going home now. All right, sir. One-fourth of this nation's earning is spent on us army men. Do you know why? So that we may protect the country and its countrymen. And when we do that, we get the big medals of bravery. But we just fulfil our duty and we get paid for it. But by saving the girl today, you have indeed done a commendable task. Naina, whenever you need me, come over to the army mess in the evenings. You will find me lying in some corner. This army man would feel glad to help a brave girl like you. Hey, brother, proceed, or I will continue with my blabbering! [engine revving] Who is it? Why don't you speak? Mother? What happened, Mother? I've picked up the phone 50 times. Nobody speaks a word. If the phone rings again, don't lift it at all. And where were you all the while? Refresh yourself and eat the meals. Already, it's too late. [phone ringing] Hello. You reached home? I remained silent though you incited Sunanda against me. But you didn't do the right thing by clashing against me directly. I lust after girls. And just because of you today I am hungry. I have no personal enmity with you or your family members. On that day I was hungry and Sonia came in front of me and that’s all. But henceforth, if you try to spoil things for me, I will make you suffering such a manner that... What will you do? What can you do? I am not going to be scared of you. I am not going to be scared of you. You may call here as many times as you wish. But I am not going to be scared of you. Understand? Just continue to battle in this manner with your fear and then see how life guides you to your destination. You have great strength, Miss Naina. You have great strength. Do you know, Bhim, what's my dream? What? That just once, I get an opportunity to do something great like the Major. And the Major himself should pat me on my back in appreciation. Sorry, Captain, but the Major hasn't come today to pat your back, but to weaken your jaws. It's not that easy. I've been practicing since the past 15 days. I will surely defeat him today. You may continue to try. If people like you don't make attempts how can the Major win the bets? Here! It's ready. Now you hit him by seeing and he will hit by hearing the sounds. [clapping] -Oh, no. -No. -Major. -Major. Hit back. Hit back. Looks like the Major will lose today. No. Major. -One. -One! -Two. -Two! -Three! -Three! -Get up, Major. Get up, sir. -Major, I said Four, yes... [clapping] [anklet jingling] [clapping] [whistling] -How was that, Bhim? -Yes, Major. [whistling] Like it's said ego causes the downfall! Now you got beaten, isn't it? Good shot, Captain, good shot. [clapping] Good shot, good shot, good shot, Captian. Thanks, Major. -[clapping] -Wow. Cheating. Why are you clapping?

Thank you very much. My sister did so much for me for 18 years. And yet I never thanked her even once. By thanking you now, I feel as if... I feel as if I am thanking her. Naina. Major. Bhim. You've done enough work. Look how much you are sweating. Come. Where? To your father's marriage. That girl, Naina, has made arrangements for your amusement. What? What is she saying? What is she saying, sir? Will you believe her sir? Sorry for the faults but tell me one thing that does your entire police department work at her directions? Hey, mind your tongue. After all... you are speaking before the Commissioner. How can she say that I killed my wife? Sunanda is more dear to me than my own life. Why would I kill her? Hey...you romeo... Dubey, shut up, will you? More, call that girl! Yes, sir. Mary, what are you doing here? What happened? Speak up, Mary. Ask him what you wanted to ask this morning? Yes. Where is Sunanda? Gokul. What do you mean? She's in the village, where else? The 3,500 rupees that I had to return to her that postal money-order has been returned. Her salary too has been returned. Hey! Gokul, where is Sunanda? How many times shall I tell you that he has killed her? He feared that she would expose his truth some day. I beg of you, sir. I request you not to speak such inauspicious things about her. Sir, she's still alive. She's still alive, sir. Look at her letters, sir. Look, sir. This letter is dated the 15th. This letter is dated the 18th. And this letter, she wrote on the 25th. All these letters are fake. No! She's still alive. Look at this she wrote this letter to me just day-before-yesterday. All these letters are fake. Leave me, leave me. -Leave, leave me. -You are her best friend, aren't you? for yourself. Isn't this Sunanda's handwriting? Look at her writing! Now say. Look at this! Yes, yes, this is Sunanda's handwriting. It means that... It means that she is alive. You people, don't try to trap me. I had told you in the beginning itself that this girl is lying. Liar! Cheat! This girl is lying, sir. See, my daughter. He had to be released this time. ACP sir, he killed my sister. Then he tried to do the same with another girl. Then he killed his wife. Despite knowing all this, why did you let him go away? Try to understand, my child. I will send Dubey to his village today itself. The facts will be known from there itself. It's of no use. He must have surely fixed things there. I have a way which perhaps won't fit into your law, but it fits my law. We will take him to his village under the pretext of enquiry. Then we will eliminate him during an encounter. Simple. I will have to speak about this with you later. For the time being, take the girl to her home in my car. All right, sir. Thank you, ACP sir, thank you very much. Now I understand that you can do nothing for me. -My child... -That is what you want to say, right? Don't worry. I won't hassle you any more. And whatever happens, I won't come back here again. I won't come. My child... Hey, hey. You were feeling very euphoric today, weren't you? I will make such a condition of yours... Leave me, leave me. ..that even the cops won't be able to recognise you. Ah, ah. Ah, ah. Gokul! Help! Hey! The tail-light has fallen. He doesn't have number plate also. [whistling] Sawant, drive faster! Hey. Shit! Sawant, drive faster more fast! [Naina screams] Hey, stop the vehicle! Hey, stop. Hey, stop the vehicle! Drive faster Sawant more faster! Ah. Stop the vehicle! Ah, ah! Ah! Hey, hey. Ah, ah. [motorcycle revving] Ah. Gokul. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Is there someone around? Open it! He will kill me, Major. He won't spare me. He wants to do the same thing that he did with my sister. He will kill me, Major. He won't spare me. He will kill me, Major. He won't spare me. He won't spare me. He won't spare me. He won't spare me. Naina, nothing will happen to you. He won't spare me. No! Are you all right now, Naina? No, I am not all right. I am not all right. If this is how I feel just by the thought of rape, how would my sister, what would she have experienced? I have never hated myself so much! I feel disgusted with myself. With my helplessness, with my tears, with my frail physique. How long would this mourning continue? What? Get up, refresh yourself, and go home. And lie to your helpless mother that you passed the night with your girlfriend. You are a woman, after all you will get habituated to bearing with suffering. What did you say? What did you say? What you think of yourself? You are making fun of me? I hate you. I was a fool that I came to ask you for support. Why do you need support? Are you a handicapped person? Your search for support has made you a handicap. You go to the court, used to go to the police, you used to come to me! What do all of us have that you don't have? Give some direction to the helplessness within you. The fire that's raging in your heart, fuel it further. And dump your helplessness in it. And burn your sister's killer in it who's also your enemy! [music playing] Ah, ah, ah, ah. Come on! Get up! Get up! Ah. 25, 26, -27. -Enough, major. Come on...five more. 28... Enough, Major, I'm tired. The truth is that you cannot undergo the hardship. No, Major! Yes, Naina, your enemy will win and you will lose. No, Major! Yes, Naina, you will lose. No, Major! Never! What are you seeing, Scoundrel? Ptoo, ptoo. Get off. Sir. Come, Waalia, come. Be seated. You wanted to see me, sir? Not me, she wanted to see you. Suhashni Josi, she's the Chairperson of the Koliwada Citizens Rights Association. Gokul Pandit stays in her area. Waalia sir, Can I ask you what gives you the right to harass a poor man repeatedly? You summon him to the police station just like that? After all, even a poor man has a right to live. He too has his respect and honour. Look at this poor man. He is completely shattered. I request you not to interfere with our work in this case. This man is pretending. The man that you describe as noble and poor is very dangerous. Alas! If you had seen the truth behind his face you would have been shocked. You wouldn't have sided with him. Does your law declare someone guilty on the basis of evidence or on the basis of someone's talent of seeing behind a person's face? I am telling you, commissioner, if your men harass even a single person of our locality we will sit outside your office constantly in protest against you. What's happening, Waalia? You have landed me in such a mess. You are an intelligent person. Henceforth, don't do anything that I find it difficult to answer them. How strange is this, sir! When the police do something these people restrict us. And when the crime-rate rises in the city, these very people blame the police in loud voices. Any way sir in future I will follow your orders. What are you doing? Who are you? Why are you hitting me? I am sorry, I am really sorry. -Ah, ah. -Please forgive me. I thought that... Who, who you think I am? You are considering me a thief. No, no it's not like that. I am a bank officer. I am a bank officer. Do you understand? Yes, but... How strange! At home, I have to face my wife. I am sorry. Then what, major, then I leaped out of the wall and turned on my left elbow and delivered a flying kick on his chest. That was all. That person jumped three feet above the ground and fell flat. Poor chap! He must be consoling himself on his wife's lap. But listen... your training has only started. Don't get over-excited. Lights off. Sleep. Tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock. Right Major. Good morning, sorry I am late. Help. Major... Major... Bhim. In this much time, your enemy would've severed your body. Ah. Beware Bhim! If you try to help her stand up, I will throw you outside. Get up, madam, just because you over powered a man by mistake you think you got the right to come late by half an hour? You thought that you have learnt everything, is it? Just because I have come late by half an hour would you kill me? What kind of a training is this? This is my training. If you want to learn something from me, you'll have to accept my ways. I cannot train you on your terms. What you think of yourself? Do you think that I can't do anything without you? Get out. To hell with your training because I don't want to be insulted in the name of training, Major. -I said get out. -Now I will do whatever needs to be done. -I said get out. -I am going. I am going. Ah. In this much time, the enemy would've severed your body. [laughing] What? [laughing] How strange you are! You are laughing despite losing? Naina, The pleasure in this defeat cannot be derived even after drinking hundred bottles of liquor. Am I right, Major? Bhim. Hey, Major, How about some party tonight? Yes, brother. I have lost from my student today. There should be a party. Wonderful! There will be chicken today, the celebrations begin. [playing trumpet] Ho, ho Ho, ho -Ho, ho -Ho, ho -Ho, ho, ho -Ho, ho, ho [laughing] Very good. Now tell me...what's your next request? A tune which has silence and depth. Silence? Depth? [playing piano] Let love happen Let immersed in love Whom are you waiting for? Whom are you waiting for? If it doesn’t happen now, then it won’t happen ever again Let love happen Let immersed in love Whom are you waiting for? Whom are you waiting for? If it doesn’t happen now, then it won’t happen ever again Let love happen I won’t come in the path of love In whichever direction the heart takes me I’ll go in that direction I feel some kind of peace, it seems as if my heart is gone If it isn’t gone now, then it won’t happen ever again Let love happen Let me enter the heart by the path of your eyes Let some things get spoiled And let some other things blossom May there arise an excuse, may a love story get written If it doesn’t get written now, it won’t ever happen again Let love happen If you delay it today or tomorrow or for some other day The thought will be forgotten What we haven’t said or done till now If we don’t do it right now, it won’t ever happen again -La, la, la... -La, la, la... Naina... for the first time today, I am feeling that if I had eyes I could've seen you. Naina, you're the most beautiful girl in the world. Aren't you? No. Why? Naina, you're different from all of them. Aren't you? Don't lie. It cannot be. You are just like I've thought you to be. Aren't you? Yes... You are exactly that... exactly that... On this earth, on this sky, the most beautiful, the most lovely, Naina. No... No, I cannot... I cannot ruin your life. Suraj. Don't come closer to me, Naina. There's a lot of darkness in my life. You will get lost. There's a whole life ahead of life. You are my life, Suraj. Try to understand, Naina. You are the most beautiful and precious gift on this earth. You are not meant to be with me. Go away from here. This relationship has no future. My future lies in this relationship. What's the future in this relationship? Which future were you looking for by offering support to a blind man? Our future, Suraj. Don't you love me? Huh? I don't have answers to these questions, Naina. Go away from here. [knock on the door] Go away, Naina. You are a coward. You are scared! Did you hear, Major? You are scared! You are scared of loving. You are scared of relationships. Because relationships gives much pain, don't they? Relationships make one weep, don't they? There's pain hidden within them, isn't there? I said go away from here, Naina. I am going. I am going. But you had better hear this, Major. Hear this It's my right to love you. And I won't let any body take this right of mine. Not even you, Major. Not even you... I will never trouble you. Not for any thing. I promise. Mother said that those whom God loves, God takes them to His home. Sonia sister why did you go away so far away? Ask God to take me with Him. I want to meet you. I want to talk a lot to you. I want to meet you. Please call me too. I miss... [glass shattering] [Naina groaning] 10 rupees for tomatoes, 10 rupees for tomatoes, 6 rupees for potatoes, 6 rupees. [glass shattering] Scoundrel! Don't you have a mother or a sister? The woman is the mother. The woman is the sister. The woman is the world. True love sprouts out of every vein of a woman. This woman loves her little child so much! Just see...she's walking away with Diya in her arms. Don't you dare touch my sister, Gokul! You're my darling. Both of them love each other so much, don't they? Beware! Don't you dare even glance towards them! How can you do this, Mrs Sehgal? Does anybody let go such a lovely child? If anything happens to her... -Bye. -Bye. -Bye, mom. -Take care. -Bye, Bye. -Gokul. -Bye. -Bye, my child. Bye, Bye. Gokul, Listen to me... Bye. She's gone. The mother went away leaving the little child alone. Gokul... Sorry, The bell is ringing. I have to go to the class. Gokul... The birds flies The birds sings in happiness The birds flies The birds sings in happiness Diya, Diya, Diya. She's gone! What? Yes, she's gone away with her Gokul Uncle. [children chattering] Hayisa, Hayisa. One, two... Wow! [lion growling] Chettah! Where's Gokul? He went away when he came, he was saying that he has to repay someone's debt. [lion growling] [lion growling] [elephant trumpets] -Sweet candy. -Thank you. Ducks. Quack, quack. Look there! [sobbing] Diya... Diya. Sister! Sister! Diya. Gokul Uncle taught me a new poem! He said that I should surely make you listen to it. Listen, sister, listen, sister. Three birds on a tree, the youngest, the middle one, and the eldest. The eldest one was hunted down. The entire family was devastated. The evil hawk found the opportunity and picked up the youngest one too. Holding the youngest one in his claws, the devil told the middle one, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, the youngest one doesn't satisfy my hunger You come over to me yourself. Otherwise one after the other, I will pluck out all her feathers. -Ha, ha, ha -Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. -Ha, ha, ha -Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Diya... Come here. Mom... where are you going? I am not going alone. All three of us are going. Go upstairs and pack your clothes. Mom... will we leave our own house fearing him? What wrong have we done? Why should we run away? Can't you sit properly? You've been wearing the same dirty clothes from the zoo. You may go if you like. I won't go. I am not scared. Tonight we are going to Kabir's place. And by tomorrow morning's train, we are leaving for Nainital. -Mumma. -Sh, sh, sh. Call my name, call my name, I'm lost When I got up, when I fall asleep I will die if got separated from you Call my name, call my name, I'm lost It's not the weather of love anymore It's no more pain of separation from you That four days of love Is not less than 100 years [phone ringing] Gokul, there's a phone call for you. There's some girl on the line. Breathe for a little while longer. -Yes? -I'm Naina speaking. I see...the older bird! I've lost. I am ready to do whatever you want, however you want. But you won't touch Diya. I don't have to. Yes. I am going home now. I will be all alone there. It's good whatever we got. [phone ringing] I am here, Gokul. I am here. But don't delay. I have just two hours. Hello, Naina. -Bhim. -Yes, sir. Dial the number again. [phone ringing] Greetings! [gunshot] How wonderful! You've started firing pistols? It's nice. Now I have made you half criminal. Now you are one of my tribe. Get off. Scoundrel! [gunshot] I am feeling nice to see terror in your eyes, Gokul. But you are very brave, aren't you? You are a big man, aren't you? One who victimises lonely and helpless girls? What happened? The fear of death has brought the truth before you? Coward! What did you think? That you will come here and you will find a weak and terrified girl with whom you could do as you please? Huh? Look carefully! Look carefully! At this very place, I have seen my mother sobbing uncontrollably over my sister's dead body. Look carefully, Gokul! What did you think? After having deprived me of my domestic happiness, I will let you live peacefully? -Huh? -[gunshot] Scoundrel! -You called me. You called me. -Leave me, leave. I will fulfil your desire today. Leave me...leave me, leave me, leave me! Leave... Naina, Naina. [Glass shattering] Be careful, Suraj. Suraj, go, Suraj, Suraj go, Suraj. Naina, Naina. Go, Suraj. Naina, Naina, Naina. -Get off. -No! Suraj. Ah, ah. Leave him, Gokul, leave him! Suraj... Suraj... don’t beat him! Scoundrel. Suraj. [Suraj groaning] Suraj. Leave him, Gokul! Suraj. No! Don't, Gokul! Leave him! Leave him! Suraj... no. [Gokul groaning] [Suraj groaning] [Gokul grunting] [Suraj grunting] Suraj. No! No! No. No, Suraj! Leave him, Gokul! [Gokul groaning] No! No! Ah, ah. You were absolutely right. I had killed your sister at this very spot. You loved Sonia a lot, didn't you? You loved Sonia a lot, didn't you? Don't worry. I will send you too to her. With you too, I will do all that I did with her. Ah... She too had lied down like this. Helpless, helpless, poor girl, the same fear, the same hatred, the same... the same restlessness, the same agony. No, no. The agony was greater. Yes, now it's fine. She too had screamed like this. Hey! She had beaten me too! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Yes now it's fine. Get off. You are also ready. I am also ready. [grunting] Get off. No! [gunshot] [Gokul grunting] [gunshot] [crying] Naina. [clapping] Congratulations, Naina. I mean, Miss Naina. You've really been amazing! -[clapping] -Thank you, sir. [clapping] The task accomplished by you by firing the pistol in yourself-defence is really commendable. You've done the task of the police force. I think that if there are a few more girls like Naina, we policemen would've to relax at home. No matter whatever the strength of us policemen in numbers... Excuse me, would you deliver this letter to Miss Naina? Tell her the Major has sent it. Like Naina, if people learn... Excuse me, Ma'am. ..to protect themselves... Thank you. ..then I feel that our police force would've been doubled. Come, sir. "Naina, I am leaving. You continued to visit the Military Hospital for the past 10 days. Despite this, after my recovery, I am going away without meeting you. Perhaps I didn't muster the courage to face you and bid you goodbye. Naina, we military people are awarded the Ashok Chakra for our bravery.&lt;/I&gt; But for what you have done despite not being a cop. I am handing over to you this priceless memento. I know that by the time this letter reaches you, I would've gone far away. But however far I go away from you your memories will always be with me. Suraj." Take this. Stop, madam. See brother, I don't have a ticket. But it's very urgent for me to go inside. Only passengers can go inside. Sir, if I don't meet him, he will go away, and... What joke is this, madam? This is an airport. People come here to leave. They don't come here to stay. Ha, ha, ha, go out, madam. Leave my arm! Just a minute, you can do one thing, the airport manager's cabin is over there. Go and meet him. Because we cannot permit you. Are your rules meant to help us, or to harass us? You tell me, Sir, do I look like a thief or some terrorist that your people have been harassing me? They don't let me in! Let me go inside, sir. It's very important for me to go inside. Attention please, Major Suraj Singh Rathod, I repeat, Major Suraj Singh Rathod, wherever you might be hearing this announcement, please enquire from the nearest intercom. Major Suraj Singh, please speak here. Suraj, Suraj, I love you so much. Don't go away by leaving me. I won't be able to live without you. I love you very much. I love you too. Let love happen Let immersed in love Whom are you waiting for? Whom are you waiting for? If it doesn’t happen now, then it won’t happen ever again Let love happen Let immersed in love Whom are you waiting for? Whom are you waiting for? If it doesn’t happen now, then it won’t happen ever again Let love happen... I won’t come In the path of love In whichever direction the heart takes me I’ll go in that direction I feel some kind of peace It seems as if my heart is gone If it isn’t gone now, then it won’t happen ever again Let love happen...
