A hundred and 10 blocks in under 15 minutes. Not bad for a one-eyed Russian immigrant. Somebody throwing a party? - You are, sir. - Oh, yeah? Am I having a good time? Well, Manhattan Fine Wines just delivered six cases of Salon Les Mesnil. Wow, pretty pricey stuff. - What did I pay for it? - What do you care? You got more money than you can even look at. Oh, I'd like to thank you for that little tip on the market you gave me. The wife says the stock's gone up five points. Good, Mike. - Want some more advice? - Sure. Sell it. Here, read my newsletter.

And that's what she says to all the guys. I'll get the next one. Go ahead. Cigar. Chris, we'll see you in the apartment. - Oop! - Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Heya, little fella. What's your name? Get down! Get down! Come on, girls. Get over here. - I'm sorry. - You oughta get cats. They're a lower-maintenance pet. Ah, here we go. Come on, let's go. Come on, girls. Chris! Chris! I hate crowds. You new in the building? You all right? Y-Yes. Take this. - I-I'm sorry. - It's okay. I never do this. Listen, some people are throwing a party up at my apartment. Why don't you come up for a drink? It'll help you relax. - What's the matter? - Oh... That son of a bitch! I don't believe this. That bastard! I can't believe this! I'll be in the penthouse if you change your mind. Thanks for the Espresso maker... And the bag of shit. Howard Suntz's office. Miriam, this is Diane. Let me talk to Howard. I'm sorry, Ms. Lightson. He left explicit instructions not to be disturbed. What's going on with this landfill deal? I'm only his goddamn lawyer. - Why didn't I know about it? - He said he's doing the deal. Your services won't be needed, professionally or personally. Look, this is not about our personal relationship, Miriam. This is business. Do you understand? It's about my-- my professional credentials, my-- my law firm's time. Why am I talking to you? You know what? You just tell Howard that I'm coming down there. Excuse me. - Oh! - Hi. Hi. Glad you could make it. Thanks. Diane Lightson I'm from the firm of Masur and Glennet. Chris Thorne. I'm sorry about the cold hands. Don't worry about it. The law firm Masur, Glennet? Weese, Weiss, Worple, Whip Me? Yeah, that's the one. What's your specialty? Uh, investment syndication and public flotation. It's got to be painful. - Would you like a drink? - I'd love one. - Scotch? - Great. Are you okay? - Yeah, fine. - Scotch. Are you going to the Suntz thing? Are you kidding? Not unless somebody holds a gun to my head. He's a fraud. He's a rip-off artist. It's all about buying lakes and filling them with garbage. I don't know what set you off in the elevator, but if I were you, I'd stay away from this Suntz guy. Let's just say I have a personal interest in this particular deal, so if you're not going, can I borrow your car? - Whoa, whoa. - I'm a good driver. I didn't say I'm not going. I just said I'm not planning on going. Uh, I mean, uh... I may have a low opinion of the guy, but if it's that important to you... maybe you know something I don't. - Maybe I should reconsider. - I really like to drive. - I'll drive. - I mean, I'm happy to drive. No, no. It's my car. I'll do the driving, okay? Okay, great. You drive. Could I? Who's going for a drive? Are you, Chris? No, not tonight, Fausto. When? Where? We love to drive. Are you going to your house in the Hamptons? - No, no. - That's fantastic. When are we leaving? Very, very early, much too early for you. How about, uh, noon in the parking garage? Noon is better. We love it! - Fantastic! - Great. I'm sorry about that. That's... Fausto and Renalda Squirinizsu. I give them investment counseling sometimes. They're Brazillionaires. They have breakfast around 2:00 in the afternoon. - We'll never see them again. - Good. So I'll see you in the, uh, garage at noon. - Okay. - Don't be late. - I won't be late. - Good. Ohh. Ugh. Ugh. Morning, Mr. Thorne. - Morning, Mike. - Fun night, huh? Oh, God, I can't do this. - Listen, do me a favor, will you? - Yes, sir. You know Diane Lightson? She just moved in... Yes, sir. 23-B? Yeah. She'll be down in a couple of minutes. Tell her, uh... Tell her I'm-I'm too tired, I'm sick, I can't drive her, and... - Yes. - Give her the car with my compliments, - will you? - Certainly. I got to get some sleep. Give me the keys, Mike. Wow! What a beautiful Beemer. Good morning. This is a vintage, what, 733i? Three point three liter? That's right. Had it two years, never been out of Manhattan. Really? Well, maybe I should drive. I'll drive. Hey, uh, let me get that for you. Thank you. Wow, this is really cherry. Mm-hmm. Make yourself comfy. Thank you, Mike. Hope you feel better, sir. I feel great-- feel fine. What the fuck... I don't believe this. I should have known a Brazillionaire never forgets. - Chris! - They're not coming with us, are they? - Agh, look at them. - Chris! I can't say no. That's a nice Beemer. Chris! Chris, dude! I imagine that you did not think we'd be up so early. Had no idea. Hi, Chris. Chris, where are we going? We're going to Atlantic City, Fausto. Get in the trunk. Good. Good. We can see the Taj Mahal. I love it. I hear they call it the ninth wonder of the world. Oh, we have the fifth in South America, in Rio... Eh, the Christ of Corcovado. Hi, I'm Renalda. Hola. Yo soy Diane. ¡Ai! ¡Puedes hablar español! ¡No lo puedo creer! This is my brother, Fausto. Encantado. Chris, put this tape on. Let's chanka. This is nice. We are nice. So, how long have you been divorced? Four years. You still love her? Nah. Been over it for... weeks. Chris, this road is such a dull place. We have a nice little surprise picnic for you. Clean food. Let's take the car into the countryside for a while. Countryside? This is the Jerseyvania Triangle. Whole damn place is a mess of burnt-out factories, junkyards, and coal fields. Believe me, I know. My grandfather was in coal commodities in the '30s. So let's go and see them. - Naw, I don't want to get lost. - You won't get lost. Look at all that fancy equipment you've got. Take the next road. Let's see if you can use all that shit. Ah, Fausto, I think we should just keep going. I don't understand what's the big deal. We made a nice little surprise picnic for you, you invited us on a drive, and now you aren't even driving us where we want to go. Dude, you could be a better host. Okay. Okay, listen. How about this? If it won't take too long, Road 329, parallel to the Pike. Okay, it crosses the Delaware and then it crosses back here. There should be beautiful river scenery and it won't take us too far out of our way, okay? It's your dime, lady. Oh, this is wonderful. ¡Ai, pero que mangos! I have two big mangoes! - Oh, yes, he has the mangoes. - Do you like mangoes? - Pull over, Chris. - Oh, this is going to be wonderful! Fausto, I don't want to stop here. - Now please, not in here. - Not here. - Keep going. - Chris, pull over to a vista. Come on. Oh, look, a village. Morning. Sell pork bellies, buy gold. Oh, Jesus! Why, Chris, look out! Oh! - What is that, a vent pipe? - It was a vent pipe. What do you want to do, get out and kiss it? Ai, Chris, it smells. It stinks. Go, go. Nice town, huh? Evel Knievel and Mr. Clean. Ah, this is better, this is better. - Pull over and find a nice table. - I like it here. I'm hungry. Let's eat right now. - Let's open the whole thing up now. - Yes, open it up. - Let's see, what do we have? What? - I don't see butter. What do you mean, "I forgot the butter"? - I didn't forget the butter. - Mrs. Squiri-- Antonio, Antonio the butler forgot the butter, not me. - Chris, do you want a drink? - I can't believe him. - No. - Now, Diana, smile! - Eh, smile. - This is a nice road. - Oh, yeah. Chris, Chris... - It's nice. Smile. I got you in the mirror. - Eh, smile. - Oh, no. A cop. Oh. Were you speeding? Sixty-five. That's the national speed limit. Well, not everywhere. It said 50 back there. Fifty? Why didn't you tell me? You don't have to stop. What? Right. Let's get out the guns and blow out his front tires. Are you crazy? Of course I'm going to stop. He's a policeman. What are you talking about, dude? This is a provincial cop, man. With this car, you could easily get away from him. Let's see if we could do 90. Are you kidding? This baby'll do 130. - Oh, so let's do it! - Good. Let's go. Go. Go, Chris. Thorne, for Christ's sake, go. Go, man. You wimp chicken, let's go! Hit it! Push it! This is a little goddamn hamlet. Chris, go! Well, here we go. - Push it! - I don't know about this. I don't know. Go, Chris. Come on, Chris, go. Don't be scared. Push it! We're winning! You have-- You have a BMW. Act like it. - Faster! - Uh... Now I think you may be breaking the law. - Oh, forget about the law! - Oh, but it is smooth, isn't it? Jeez, he's got a fast car, too. Oh, sh... Chris, Chris, move it. For Christ's sakes, move it, Chris. Uh, maybe we better stop. No. No, I think I can lose him. Pull your vehicle over now, please. Pull over now. What the hell is that? Detour! - Chris, watch out! - Ooh, here we go! Whoa! He still with us? Uh-oh. Where the hell are we? Go to the left! Go to the left! Pull over. Get over. Oh, shit! Be careful on this side! I'll do the driving, all right? Just come on, get over! Just get to the right! Just get to the right! Will you be quiet, Fausto? Just let me drive, all right? Sir, this is a heavily-traveled industrial artery. These trucks own this road. Oh, man. I just want to get to Atlantic city. What's-- Sir, these speeds are not advisable through here. ¿Tienes dolares? Oh, no! Everybody relax. All they can do is cite me and hand me a bunch of tickets. I'll pay 'em and we'll be on our way back to the turnpike. Oh, I see. It's all my fault now. Folks, meet Andy Griffith. Good afternoon. Driver, step outside the car, please. Was I speeding? Sorry, wasn't sure you were a real cop, and, uh, please... I mean that in a complimentary sense. That's okay. There's no law against having a sense of humor. Now turn around, put your hands on the roof of the car, please, sir. There you go, sir. Spread 'em. Ah, come on, now, really? - Spread 'em. - "Spread 'em"? Wha-- Ah-- Oh! Com--! Yeah, that's nice, thanks. The lower back, please. Thank you. Yeah. Check the prostate. That's nice. Oh! All right. Thank you. I got an itch right up in there. That's good. Thank you. Not today, sir. Turn around. May I see your license, registration, and insurance, please? - What's the charge? - You were speeding, but that's not why I began to follow you, sir. Back there in the village, you failed to make a full stop at the intersection. Oh, really? Oh, I didn't even notice. Well, as I say, that's the initial reason why I followed you, and why you're under arrest now. The speeding and reckless evasion will be overlooked if you cooperate now and quietly get in your car and follow me. - Clear? - Sir... Sir... Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. This may be... Valkenvania, but it is still America, and we have an appointment at Atlantic City, so we'd... just like to get going. Wouldn't mind, will you just write a ticket here or... we could settle it some other way, perhaps? Step back, please. I understand, sir, but, you see, that's not the way things work around here. You're gonna have to follow me a ways to the reeve, then it's up to him how we proceed. - Reeve? - The local justice of the peace. Now, I'm planning not to mention the speeding to him, so I suggest you come quietly and immediately, unless you want more trouble than you're already gargling. Ai. What's that beeping? It means we're off the map on this cartridge. What time does Suntz start the hype? Six o'clock. It's 3:30 now. We can still make it if you just let me do the talking. Look at this metal sculpture. They must be into folk art. Folk 'em. What is that, music? They're piping in music. "Enjoy your stay." What is this place? My God. So that's where they buried Flipper. - Flipper's dead? - Flipper's dead? "Village J.P." "Shire reeve." It's like Robin Hood... "Be polite." Hmm. Oh, and no cussing. Shit. Wow. Look at all these toasters. There is a negativity about this place. "Valkenheiser Salvage"... "Trespassers will be shot." Oh, come on. There's a funky karma here, man. Is this a joke? Ai, ai, ai, I hope so, because I don't think I like it here at all. Where the hell are we? Listen, do we have to get out here? "Valkenvania Courts and Schools, 1898." Valkenvania. Hi. File in. Reassemble. Lucy, I'm home! Oh, yeah. It's old, it's old. Right this way, folks. Wait. I'm entitled to one phone call. Surely. And you're more than welcome to make one if... we had a phone. - There's one in my car. - Your car's been impounded. Impounded? Already? Step up to the railing. Please. May I have your IDs, everyone, please? I already have yours, Mr. Thorne. Thank you. Thank you. These trials usually last only a couple minutes. Revolving District Court for the village and shire of Valkenvania is now in order! The Honorable Reeve Alvin Valkenheiser presides. Okay, Dennis, give me their licenses, ID, toll tickets, report cards, notes from the teacher. There you go, Judge. Traffic violation. Contravention of village bylaw 23, failing in the execution of a full stop at a place so marked. I recommend fine, bond, and release. What else you want to do for 'em, bake 'em a pie? All right here... Who's Christopher Lawrence Thorne? That's me, Your Honor. Thorne Financial Publishing, Water Street, New York. Okay. Banker? No, no, no. Banker, no. Financial publishing. - Thorne's Weekly? - Okay. Banker. Oh, here. Well, look at this. Passports. I will have you know that my brother, Fausto, and I enjoy diplomatic immunity in this country. Oh, yay, well, uh... And you are the Fausto and Renalda... Squirrriinii... Squiriniz... Siz... Siz... Sizwi. Sizwi? Friends of the bride. Yeah, that's right. We all want to get married. No, sir. No wedding. Moving violation... Failure to stop. Let's just be quiet and let him do his little thing, and we'll be on our way. Oh, I will let you be on your way, and... Oh, when you go, the cat's eyes'll spin! Now, listen! Okay. We'll listen. A-hey, hey, ho, ha, ho! Hula, hula, hula, the boola, boola, boola! Look who's got the front seats of the Mexican hat dance now. Just like a bunch of spiders in a birthday cake. You might be interested to know that you are not under the jurisdiction of just any old fishing license dispenser and stamp-pad jockey! We've always been set to deal with the offenders once and for all at their first appearance, quick as sump grease through a 10-year-old goose. Congratulations. I'm glad to know things are running smoothly for you. Put out that dog rocket! Sir, sorry. In 1796, my forefathers established this seat after the tenets of the old shire charter. Shire charter? Excuse me, sir, that's pre-Magna Carta. I mean, serfdom and fiefdom stuff. Very good, young lady. Heh, you know, you and I ought to spend a little more time together. Well, I'd-- I'd like that. Would ya? Well, then, more on how they packed me off to Farmers' Mechanics' University in Gracefield, Ohio, for my engineering degree... And how I fought the Germans in World War I later. - But for now... - Later? Wait, ho, ho, ho! No later. Wait a minute. What is this shit? Sir, no cussing in court! We don't want to hear the story of your life. We just want to pay the ticket and get the hell out of here! - I'm sorry, Judge. - Well, look at him! He's going on and on! This court herewith binds you over for a further appearance to be held at 4:00 tomorrow afternoon. We so deem for the public and common good that you be confined herein. So for now... Good night, Irene! - Aah! - Aah! Ai! Shit! What's the point in that? They're clean. No drugs, no guns, nothing. Ah, just another batch of hot-pistol, lily-water city chickens to run through Grandpa Alvin's trick house. When I'm gone, you'll be reeve. You can run things any way you want. 'Til then, you just do your job. So help me, Dennis, I'll cut you out of the will. You won't get so much as Flossie the nag. I always do my job, and you know it. But I don't mind letting you know my duties end right here at this bench. Oh, fine. Go suck a bug. Are you okay? What are we going to do? - Oh, Fausto... - What was that for?! How could you be so insensitive? What do you mean? What are you talking about? Fausto, you better do something about this. Niña, you're pulling on my coat. Now, cool it! I had us out of here! Then you had to go and open your big mouth. You had us out of here? We would've been here another two hours listening to the history of the Valkenburger farm, or wherever the hell we are! I knew that I couldn't depend on you. Listen, I don't need this! I was just trying to drive us to Atlantic City for you! - Oh, is that right? - Yeah! You're no longer our financial advisor! You're fired! - Shut up! - Shut up! Miami, baby, here we come. - Yeah, you can just plant your body on me. - Here, take this. - Oh, baby, I'll just come hold you... - Have they got a Jacuzzi in this place, huh? - ♪ Get down to the pavement ♪ - ♪ Get down ♪ ♪ Funky and mysterious ♪ ♪ Some people live in little grooves ♪ ♪ But Romeo needs more room to move ♪ - We got company. - Want this? - Nah. - Oh, shit.

I'll take care of it. - Where's the pot? - Would you shut up? - No, I want you to pass it to me. - No! - Did we stop? - It's under the seat, Sharpy. Okay. Where's the bottles? Shut up. - My God. - Good evening. Driver, step out of the car, please. Okay. Good evening, officer. Chief. Driver's license, registration, insurance, and fitness certificate, please. Okay, Arthur... - have you been drinking tonight, son? - No. Yeah, I had a couple. So what? I'm fine. I'm afraid you'll have to blow. Blow you to get out of a ticket? Forget it, Tom. That's not funny. I meant you'll have to use a breathalyzer. I'll blow him. Maybe later... next century. Let's go, son. Oh, come on, officer, we were-- Ya- blew double drunk within the village limits. - You're going with me. - Sure. Whatever you say, officer. Say good night, copper. Please, please, no. Don't kill me. Chiefy, pal, I was only kiddin'. Okay. - No! - My God! And will you look at his face? Is that nose rubber? Hey, I don't want you. I want Judge Wapner. I have to plead the fifth dimension. Okay. Okay. Well, let's see here, what we got... We got your, uh, crack and ice cocaine here. You got your pills and your vials of coke, snorters, and pipes, and grinders, and... got your gun here and you got your switchblade knives. Well, since you're all havin' a whirl of a time on some some kind of a hopped-up date, I believe that we can get this all over relatively simply and have you people on your way, so step forward to the bench, please. Hey, see that? Thanks for understandin', Judge. You know what I'm saying? You take care of this. I'm gonna go out for a smoke. Go for a smoke? Dennis, they've got guns, drugs. One of them tried to kill ya. I'm staying to watch. Okay, I hereby find all parties culpable in these matters as charged, and so choose to inveigh the maximum levy for these violations, and do therefore deem that you be conveyed to a wholly-- oh, awful place of execution wherein you shall be put to death. Yeah! - Whoa! - Whoa! - Aah! - Aah! ¿Que es eso? What's going on? Heh heh! Yes. What's go-goin' on here, huh? I'll tell you what, there. I'll give you all your coke and your grinders and your spoons, and pot and guns and knives and all that back to you when you come out the other end. ♪ Goin' down ♪ ♪ Bonestripper ♪ ♪ You don't know what you're going to do ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're really goin' down ♪ ♪ The bonestripper ♪ Hee-hee heh-heh ho-ho!

Little white wine, arugala salad, maybe some pasta. Welcome to supper. How 'bout a nice Hawaiian Punch? Thank you, Judge. You know, there's nothing better at the end of a long day on the road than a nice, warm glass of Hawaiian Punch. Here's to good friends. Does he treat all traffic violators this graciously? Only the ones he takes special interest in, like bankers. Ants on a log, ma'am? Uh... Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'd... love one. Cousin? Oh, ants. Oh, yeah, sure. Oh. Folks... I'd like to introduce my granddaughter, Eldona. She's single and the best class "A" mechanic in five states. She's adorable, Judge. She'd make an ideal wife, too. Genuine wage-earner, and... struck dumb at birth by a thunderclap. My kind of woman. I think the two of you'd make a perfect couple. Hmm. You look pretty this evening, sister. Doing something different with your hair? Oh! Hmm. Eldona, would you please prepare the meal? - Mmm. - Thank you, dear. Hmm. Want to see the wine list? Young man! It is basic human politeness to share your conversation with the whole table. So what's on your brain?! Alvin, I was just thinking, you've got enough, uh, vintage steel around here to make a few thousand Toyotas. Ever think of selling the whole place to the Japanese? There you go! Does the Pope wear a hat? Was Sergeant York's mother an angel? And will a banker grope for money? I'm not a banker, I'm a financial publisher. Yeah, well, all I know is in '17, after they shipped me off to fight, some New York financier rolled in here one day and... hoglowsered and tubwangled my grandfather into mining the whole place out in exchange for shares in something called the United Coke Company. Do you know what those stock certificates are worth today? Just about the finest outhouse wallpaper you've ever seen! We were forced to become what you drove through today, a burnt-out coal field, and the biggest icebox graveyard east of the Ohio foundry belt. And that's why I never let a banker go. So your grandpa made a lousy deal. Is that our problem? Judge... that's a very tragic, tragic story. I believe it is. You should do a book. How do you like your dog, folks? They're serving dog?

That's a hell of a way to break up with a guy, if that's what you're doing. So you picked the wrong guy. Happens to the best of us. I've been through this. You know... when it comes to love, there's no accounting for taste. Hell, I used to be married to Imelda Marcos. You don't have to put yourself through this. A guy like that's gonna end up burying himself, anyway. He doesn't deserve you. You're too good for him. Oh, I'm just such a jerk. I mean... why do I always pick the wrong guy? I mean, I'm... I'm so trusting... and so gullible. I mean... I don't know why I'm such a pushover. I mean, I'm such a sucker. Mmm. Mmm. I just love a pretty face. Oh. Oh, it's so... Oh, it's so embarrassing. Oh!

Oh, no! No! Oh! Oh, no! No! Oh, oh, oh! - Ah! - Aah! Oh, Jesus. We got to get out of here. How far does this go? It goes all the way to-- - Oh! - Oh! Ah! All the way up to here. - Are you all right? - Ooh! Ooh! Ahh! It's a blind staircase. Maybe I can... oh. - Wait. - Pull that one. Got it. Go on. Jesus, look out! - Hoh. - You all right? Hah. I don't know how much more of this crap I can take. We're trapped. Wow, look at all these IDs. What is this? There must be thousands of 'em. Passports and Auto Club cards. Wow, a license: "Virginia Horse and Trappings, 1896." "Statewide search for outlaw biker gang underway." "Busload of Hare Krishnas... "Disappears." "Ex-Nazi Rocket Scientist Vanishes," '49. All these IDs match the-- the news clippings. Look at this. "Jimmy Hoffa Still Missing" and here's his ID. Are you kidding? Oh, wow. You know, I think they've been doing this around here since the 1890s and I don't see any reason why they're gonna stop at us. I mean, look at this. They're all criminals and creeps. Bankers. Exactly. Nah. Aah! What happened? Aah! - Aah! - Aah! Oh. I wish we were on that train. Me, too. Good luck, slick. Hey, look at this, it's a slide. Yeah, but this is no playground. Could be a bed of spikes down there. - Let's go. Come on. - Go. You go. Take it slow. Aah! Aw, shit! Oh! Whoa! Diane! Oh, whoa! Whoa! Uh-oh. Diane! - Aah, ho, ho! - Whoa, oh! Where? Why? What? What?

First, I think you oughta know something. In many cases here, I do often choose to inveigh the maximum levy. Frequently, undesirables are put to death. Oh, sure, I can understand that, Judge, but come on... death for running a stop sign? And for being a banker. That's the double death. However, I'd be willing to cast aside all findings, be blind to your banker's blood, let you live out your days here as... husband to my granddaughter... father to her child, and... heir to my seat. Wha-- What are you saying? It's death or Eldona? Oh, come on, lad. Take her hand. Warm my tired old heart. I know women. She loves you. Ever since she saw you, she's been floating around like milkweed in a spring breeze. Mm-hmm. Make her happy. Take care of her needs, and... you'll inherit a fortune Ali Baba would crave. Listen, Judge... Uh... You know, I-I-I-I-- I've s-spent some time alone with her, and she's a spectacular woman. She's quiet but, uh, just shy, just shy. - Mute. - Ah. But... Judge, as far as her needs are concerned, I could never presume to be able to fill them. Oh, you can slip on a pud collar. Now, let me get you out of these cuffs and chains, and everything, I'll get you all married up, and we'll welcome you to this family with an all-night reel. - No cuffs, huh? - No cuffs. Pud collar.

Well, Judge, plenty of time for that on the honeymoon. You may kiss the bride. No, not in front of all these people, Your Honor. Now! Yo, way to go, homeboy! - All right! - Yeah! All right, so, let's get out of here before the old man changes his mind, all right? - Yeah, okay. - Wait! Wait! Help me! - We're out of here. - Wait!

You okay, Judge? - See? - Wow. You see that? Now somebody's gotta pay for the way they sapped this ground. - You want your pills? - I'm all right. Hey, hotworm! Listen!

What's the matter, boy? Heh, heh, heh. Ain't she worth it? All right, you old liver spot. Sorry about this, Diane. But we have to tie you down like Grandpa Alvin says. I wish it was him we were tying down - instead of you. - Yeah. We don't like him, but we love you. This is a classic case of a dysfunctional family. I mean, you should consider some help, some therapy. He won't go! Okay, cowboy. Last chance saloon. I'm gonna count down from 10. If I don't hear your voice by the time I get to one, - I'm gonna cut her! - Aah! - Oh, don't! Oh! No! - Eldona, get them blades up. Mmm. Eldona, hey, listen... You wanna... Why don't we go to New York? I'll take you to Elizabeth Arden. - We could do a lot-- - Ten! Guys! Get me outta here! Nine. Come on, now, banker! Eight. What's wrong with this little girl here? She a bad kisser or something? Seven. Chris, I really didn't mean for you to save yourself! Get your ass back down here and save me! Six. - Chris, get down here! Don't leave me! - You ain't giving me much choice, boy. - Five. All right, now, boy! - Please, Chris! Last chance saloon! Four. - Don't! - Three. - Two. - Aah! One. - Diane! It's me. - Help me!

Oh, I knew you'd save me. I think I dirtied my diaper. Oh, get me the hell out of here, Chris! He's fly-dicking with me! Eldona, drop those blades! Get him! Get him! Aah! - Aah! - Shit! Hey! Get 'im! Get aaah! Who are the infant bodies? Bobo and Little Debbull. They're not allowed in the house. - Get that spotlight, okay? - Okay. So what do you play when you go to Atlantic City? Blackjack? Craps? Got to find them! I don't think they saw us. - Come on. - Okay. Excuse me. Coming through. Sorry. Excuse me. Aw, we'll never get across this. Oh, no. Let's head towards the train. Come on, through the woods. Smells like São Paulo. - Who's that man that was with her? - I don't know. I don't know, neither, but she got away. You're the one that was supposed to be watching her. Oh, yeah. That's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I feel stupid. Bobo, shut up and drive! There they are! On the hill! Get 'em before they get to the top! Stop them! Okay. - Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hold on! - Stop! Hey, stop! Stop! - Hey! Now! Come on! - I'm with you. - Right! Come on, reach! You can do it! Come on! I can't make it. Trust me. Come on, reach out! Come on. That's it! Damn it! That's it! How did I miss that one?! We gotta get some help. As soon as the train stops, we'll get off and call the police. You saved my life. Thanks. It was worth it. Bye, Diane! - Diane... - Bye-bye! Bye, Diane. Then we w-- had that spinning bed, the door flew up, and we came... got up into that, uh, a-attic... - Up in the attic. - ...with the newspapers and, uh, the... - All those licenses, and then... - Yeah, that's pretty much where - we found all the licenses of the, uh... - ...and then... - and the newspaper clippings... - ...we kind of sat down... - which matched each other. - And had a cigar. We were smoking a... relaxing, and... - Yeah, there was no way to know, I mean... - All of the... - It said Hoffa was still missing. - What was that... - As far as we knew, he was still there. - ...an escape hatch, or whatever? - Oh, we ended up in a tunnel. - Anyway, this door opened... ...and we went flying. Bobo and Little Debbull saved me. - Luckily, I was able to hear it... - And we climbed the cliff till we got on the train right after the fuel dump explosion. We think maybe the Brazillionaires have been killed. That's... dead. You folks, of course, will have to come with us for identification purposes. Wait a minute. This man removed his nose and upper teeth three inches in front of my face and started crooning like Bing Crosby. I'd like to help out, but I'm pretty sure I can pick him out in a lineup, you know what I mean? We could do it. We? This is the state attorney general. We have a warrant to search these premises. Why-Why don't you just blast your way in? First, we have to serve the warrant to someone. You know, I bet we could get them to come out. - Us? - You know, Miss Lightson doesn't have a bad idea there. Well... I suppose it's worth a try, if... if... you two are up to it. - It'd be our pleasure. - Wait a minute. Wait. Can't wait to see his face when he gets a load of this. Okay. Yes? Well, what's going on here? Who are you? Why are you bothering an old man? You're through, Judge. Oh... you kids better look out behind you. There's a bee's nest. Hi, Judge Alvin! Evening, troopers! Can't go too far in this part of the world without running across my friends. Alvin is something, isn't he? And... of course we can't admit that we appreciate the way he gets things done. And since you know what you know, I'm afraid we're gonna have to come to... some kind of a... ar-arrange-- It's the coal fire! The seams are giving way! Run for your lives! Come on, grab me! Grab me! I'm not gonna lose you now! Come on! Gotcha. Hey, what's all that shaking? I don't know. I didn't do anything. Aah! - You all right? - Yeah. - My Beemer! Get in! - No. Come on, it won't start. It's got a fuel cut-off switch. It's part of the alarm system. - No seat belts. - No roof. Oh, my...! ¡Ai, Fausto! That was the most adventurous weekend of my entire life. When I think about what happened in Valkenvania... I would do it again. Not me. I was like James Bond. Don't worry, Dennis. Now that you are head of our personal security... And my lover... Dude, your life's gonna be fantastic. And don't you worry. No one's gonna touch you or my little Flora de la Luna. Ooh. Dennis, listen to me... You can-- Scare-- Squish-- S-S-Squerneesh. Squershwammies! Oh. Ho. T-T-Tie... T-Tie... T-T-T-Tie-- T-Tie the knot. T-Tie... Tie-Tie-Tie. Tie-Tie-Tie. Go. Go. No, don-- Mon--! The bu--! Woof! Woof! No! Huh! Hey, Chris? Chris, hey, hey, hey! It's okay. It's okay. Take it easy. I think you're just having a little napmare. Oh. Ohh. It's over? Oh, yeah, it's over. - You're okay, we're safe. - Oh, god. Take it easy. Oh, jeez, what a weekend. Yeah, no kidding. But it's okay. I'm gonna go take a shower. - Okay. - Okay. - Just rest. - I'll rest. Okay. I'm gonna watch a little TV. Numerous fire companies from New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and all neighboring states are barely able to handle the subterranean mine fire near the town of Valkenvania. - Diane, you should see this. - Our Susan Campost is on the scene. Roger, this cloud may have a silver lining. Geologists say the brief but intense heat from fissures 10 miles below have cooked the upper coal tailings into a fine, medium-grade crude... over 50 million barrels. Wait just... just one second, Roger. I see one of the village residents rummaging through the remains. Excuse me, sir, how do you feel now that you have lost everything?
