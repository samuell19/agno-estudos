Jude? Jude? I'm home. Turn off the video games. Jude? Gotcha! Shit! Another prank? Why do you have to keep doing this? I got you good, didn't I? You think you're funny, huh? Okay. Okay. Saved by your dad. -Hi. -Dad! What's up, mate? You've been a big man in the house, and taking care of your mum? More like scaring his own mom. I used the shoe trick. The shoe trick? Let me see... No, I think you must be mistaken me with someone else, mate. Real sneaky you two. I can't stay long, luv. I gotta take some clients out for dinner. I just wanted to check in on my two favourite people. And you know that I miss you both. And I love you guys so much. -Love you, Dad. -Bye, kiddo. Later. You know it's the third time this week you've been late. I know. I know. I just gotta finish these deadlines and I'm done, I promise. When I get back, maybe I could find a way to make up to you. Well, Friday night, we do have the nanny. Oh, then I will see you on Friday night, lady. If you're lucky. -Night. -Good night, luv. Were you really scared, mom? I was. But next time let's get your dad. Okay. Looks like Mr. Brown could use a cuddle. Mom. I'm too old to still sleep with the Teddy bear. Well, I won't tell if you won't. Good night. Good night, Mom. Jude? If you're trying to scare me again, it's not funny. Okay. Mom. What are you doing? Mom, don't! No! No! Jude! Jude! Mommy! I thought we could take a look at some of those toys today. Or perhaps there is something you'd like to talk about? You don't like coming here very much, do you? But you do understand why you're here? You know, Jude, if you'd like to go, all you need to do is to say, I'd like to go now. Five months isn't an unusual time for this kind of selective mutism. I've seen children stop talking for much longer from much less severe trauma. Encourage him to communicate, but try not to force it. It has to go from him. The more we force things the more he's gonna pull back. And how are the two of you holding up? We're good. Yeah. Well, as we can be. We're really just trying to focus on Jude's recovery right now. Well, I commend your dedication, but Jude is looking to you now. And if you're not getting better, he won't get better. Thank you. Another headache? It's not that bad. I thought the Doctor had some good things to say. Yeah. I think... Jude is a little better. No, I meant... That shit about us, healing too. Well, I'm... fine, really. You never leave the house. You have nightmares every night. You don't even let me touch you. I'm... not having this conversation again. We've never had this conversation. You've never talked about what happened, or how you feel. What if we run away? Out of the city, someplace quiet. You're already homeschooling Jude, I could work wherever. I think it'll be a good chance for us to have a fresh start. I'll think about it. What is it, sweetheart? Liz. Liza, be quiet. Liza! Liza! Liza. Liza. It's okay. It's okay. You're all right. I'm sorry, sweetheart. It's okay. I can't do this anymore. Hiya, I'm Pamela. Oh, I'm glad you found it. Can I show you the house? -And what's this little man's name? -Jude. He's a little shy. Well, I bet we'll be best friends in no time. This used to be a guest house of a much larger property. But after the owner of the manor house passed away, some city man, no offense, came and scooped it up. I think he was gonna restore it, but I imagine the job got too much for him. Lucky for you, folks, though. Some time in a countryside. It's perfect. -I'll give you a little tour if you like. -No... -I think we can handle it from here. -Oh, alright. -Thank you. -Take care. Cheers. Bye-bye. So, what do you think? -It's beautiful. -Yeah? -You sure? -Yes. And what about you, big boss? Alright. I vote we try a little... nature exploration! -It's beautiful, isn't it? -Yeah, totally. Smell the air. That's some fresh air. What's that? That must be the main house. Let's check it out. Look at that! Wow. That is what I call a house. Come here. Come on, Jude. Jude. Wow. This place must've been quite something back in the day. Glennview Estate. Jude, come play with us. Jude. Over here. Jude. Over here. Jude. Let's look it up. The house like this probably has some real history to it. Sean. Jude, take me. Jude. Would you hold me? Yeah, forget the guest house. I'm moving in here. What do you say, Jude? Jude? Jude! Jude. Jude! Mate, don't run off like that, please. You can't run off like that, not up here. What's that? Did you just find that? Can I take a look? Oh my goodness, it's filthy. Where on earth did you find it? Do you wanna keep it? Okay. Let's get it cleaned up first. Right. Can't wait to have this guy in the house. Can I see? Rules? I bet you have a story to tell. Looks like he wants a friend. It looks like he was broken before. And put back together again. Okay, let's go to bed now. Come on, mate. You sure you got everything you need there, little fella? Yeah? You just make yourself home. Beat your feet up. There's nice cold bear in the fridge. I could use some of those PJs. You dressed him yourself? That sounds lovely. Are you hungry? Okay. I'll make pancakes. I guess it's a bad time for me to start my morning commute all the way down the hallway. Really hope there's no traffic, guys. You wanna stop by the office for lunch today? Did I mention that I was just down the hallway. I'll try to sneak by. Goodbye, Judster. Goodbye... Did we come up with a name for him yet? Brahms? Wow. Like the composer? That's quite the name, how did you come up with that? Oh, he told you? Alright. Yeah. Of course, he did. Silly me. Alright. Bye gang. Goodbye, Brahms. Well, what should we start with today? Math or history? Okay. Jude, over here. Wait up. Right here. This way. Jude! I told you not to run off like that! This is where you found him? Oz, get in here! This is private property. I'm sorry, we're staying at the guest house. We were just on a walk, I didn't know-- Of course, you are the new family. Sorry, I got a lot of people snooping around up here. Look, I'm Joseph. Jo. I tend the grounds around here. Part guard, part gardener. This is Oz. I'm Liza, and this is Jude. We can put the doll back. -Do you want us-- -No, no. Keep it. No one's gotta miss it around here. Just me and Oz these days. Unless of course you'd like to put it back. He's little quiet. Don't worry about that. Not much of a talker myself. People think I'm crazy for living out here on my own. I'm more sane than any of them. The real crazies are living in the city packed together like a bunch of cattle. Thank you, but no, thank you. You didn't really have to walk us all the way back. I don't mind. We're neighbors now. I suppose we'll be seeing quite a bit here. Hey there. It's a healthy-looking 12-gauge. Or a 12-bore. I was worried about you. This is Joseph. Joseph, this is my husband, Sean. -Hi. -Joseph-- I attend the grounds around here. Keep the two-leggers out. Caught these two right on deed. Yeah, these two are trouble, alright? Well, thanks for escorting them back. Right, well then. Let me know if you need anything. Yeah. Nice meeting you. The pleasure is all mine. See you soon, little fella. Bringing home the local strays already, huh? He's right there. He insisted on walking us all the way home. Come on, Oz. Come on. Nice of him, I guess. I mean who the hell buries a doll in the woods like that? Maybe some weird little kid put it there. I don't know, sweetheart. Baby, you weren't there, you didn't see it. His entire wardrobe in this... coffin thing. Okay. So what you wanna do? You wanna take the doll away from him? Yes. No. I don't know. I just-- I just think it's all a little bit... creepy. I don't think it's the doll that's the problem here. What does that mean? Nothing. Let's just finish the dishes, yeah? I got some work to do before we go to sleep. No, I wanna hear what you were about to say. What's the problem? Sometimes I feel like you use Jude to avoid talking about what happened to you, and I don't think that's healthy for either of you. Mommy! You know, I nearly died in some random senseless burglary. And I'm actually aware of that every single day of my life! Yes, but that's over now. Hey! Didn't like the dog? The dog. Dog's bark. I know it's me, just got scared. Liza, I'm sorry. Holy shit! Should we just leave him alone, or do you wanna open the door? No, I wanna go in, I wanna see if he'll talk to us. Okay. Let's go. So, this is yours. Hey, sweetheart. We were just outside, and we thought we heard you talking. Were you talking to Brahms? Great. So, what were you guys talking about? Oh, the dog from this morning? Did it scare you? Brahms doesn't like him? That's... That's great. We'll let you get back to Brahms. Good night. I'm thinking about watching a movie. You interested? Oh, yeah. Sure. I guess we're keeping that doll. Are you kidding? I love that creepy thing. Liza? Liza, It's okay. Honey, it's okay, look at me. It was just a dream. It was just a dream. Look at me, it's fine. Okay? Jude. Jude, I'm sorry. He's mine! You okay? Another nightmare? Where's Jude? He's sleeping in his room now. It's the first time he slept in his own bed. Come on. Let's go back to bed. Here you go. You want two, yeah? Does Brahms want, too? Hey, good morning. You're up? I let you lie in. I thought you could use it. Thank you. Here you go, luv. -What's this? -Oh, that? Yes. Well, apparently Brahms's handing down rules now. Including he'd like a certain food. Always and Forever? Oh, dear. What happened to Mr. Brown? Jude? Buddy. Did you do this? Come on, mate. It's no right to blame him now, is it? Look, we're not mad at you. But this is not a way to treat your things. And it's never okay to lie. So, did you cut up Mr. Brown? Okay, then why don't you go to your room and finish your homework there, and then when you're ready to tell me what happened, you can come out. You can leave the doll here. Jude. You heard your mum, leave the doll please. Maybe it's a good thing. He's getting his anger out. It's pretty violent. Really? That wasn't funny. You're supposed to stay in this room, and not come out again until you're ready to apologize. Fine, you can stay in here for the rest of the day then. Jude? Your father and I said no doll! Okay, I am gonna count to three, and if this door isn't open... One! Two! Three! What are you doing here? Hey. I have someone here who wants to apologise. Come on. Hey. Thank you for apologizing. Okay, let's get you to bed, yeah? Go brush your teeth, good boy. You okay? Not good. I could've sworn I saw somebody go into his room. -and then-- -You didn't. It's fine. Honestly, these pranks are getting out of hand. Yeah, but I thought everything would be better once we got... out of the city. I don't know what to do. I just feel like I'm letting you and Jude down. Not letting anyone down. Please don't be sorry. -You'll feel better after some sleep. -Yeah. -Good night. -Alright. I understand that some of Jude's recent behaviors would be upsetting. But the doll clearly is providing him with a safe outlet to process his trauma. Now comes the hard part, where he might try to act out some-- Act out? What if we just get rid of the doll? How bad would that be? I urge you to be patient, and allow him to have his friend. He's found a place with this doll where he feels safe. And the last thing we want to do is to take that away. I'll send you some links with further information. Okay, sounds good. Thanks, Doc. -We'll speak to you soon, yeah? -Okay, take care. Pass it. There you go. Nice. That's it, one, then move it on. Perfect. Hello, Jude. What do you got there? Okay. You thought of a name for him yet? What is it? Of course it is. That's his name, isn't it? What else would it be? You scrubbed up well, little man. So, I see you found yourself a new fan boy. Just look at the expression on his face. Like he has got a secret that only he knows. You've noticed that? Can I help you? Hello there, I was just looking for-- for Oz, my dog. -We haven't seen him. -All right then. I have pretty good idea where he'll be anyway. Right, I'll be off. You be good now. Come on, it's time to go inside. -You left Jude outside alone? -I just left him for a second. -What happened? -I'm sorry. I just saw him. He was just there. I'm sorry. Oh my God, Liza. What are you doing here? Jude? I'll always be with you. They will be sorry. Sorry. I didn't know that you were standing there. Why are you wearing that? Dinner's in 15. No, it's just the three of us for dinner tonight, Jude. No, not tonight. It doesn't really matter, Liza. Your mum said no, mate. So, I was thinking inviting Liam out with family. How about that? We could use some company. Yeah? Missed your uncle Liam, aunty Mary and your cousins? I think it'll be fun. He's always good at laughing. I think they'd love to get out of the city. They're not really guests. They're family. Yeah? You know, your dad and I make the rules in this house, not your doll. Eat it. Alright, come on. Enough! No, it's fine. You can sit here until you decide you can eat your food. Just do as your mum says. Please. It's okay, it's fine. You have work to do. Well, if you won't talk to me, will the doll? That's because Brahms is not a person. He's not real. He doesn't need any food. You do. The doll and his rules do not run this house. Fine. Stay here all night then. What? Jude. Jude. What's-- What in the hell happened? I don't know. Look, I believe you. I do. It's just... Those are some scary drawings. I mean it's not really surprising, is it? Considering what he's been through. The drawing of the dog. The dog? There is no dog here. There was one! And others. Sean. There was a drawing of Jude standing over our dead bodies, and he was holding a gun! So, you're saying he ripped pages out of his book? No, I-- I don't know what happened. I just know that I want that doll out of our house. Liza, please. Let him be. No, I don't want it here. I don't like what it's doing to Jude. What? I mean all of this... This is a lot for a little kid, don't you think? This isn't a light table for starters. Are you asking me if I did this? Somebody's done this, you were the only person in here with him. No! Something is happening to him. And it started with that doll! Fine, we'll get rid of the doll in the morning, okay? What are we gonna do about them, Brahms? Oz? Where are you, boy? Come here, Oz. Come here, boy. Oh, Oz. Lovely. I need that. Thank you. -Ready? -Yeah. Let's do it. Good morning, mister. No. Sean. Jude! Come on, buddy! It's not funny, Jude! I'll go this way, you're... -You head off that way. -Okay. Let's circle around, we'll meet back in the house. Jude! Jude! Jude! Jude? Jude? Jude. Jude? Jude, is that you? Jude, what are you doing? Jude. Where are you? Just like our Mommy. Over here. Come play with us, Mommy. Jude? Jude. I'm sorry I scared you. We were just playing, Mommy. It's so good to hear your voice-- Here you are. We were looking all over for you? Didn't you hear us calling? No. Jude, what the hell were you doing in here? It's not safe! I'm sorry, Daddy. Jude, he's... You're talking. All right, let's go. We're not really supposed to be in this part of the house. Come on. It's so nice to hear you talking. Joseph, what happened in this house? Jude, why don't you go yourself to the music room. Stay close, mate. There was a family lived here a long time ago. Had a son who went a bit mad. Killed a little girl. Got burns in fire. Wore a mask to hide it. Lived inside the walls of the house for 30 years. Never came out. The Heelshires? Yeah. The Heelshires. And? And their parents committed suicide. Drowned themselves. Very sad story. And their son? Well, it all got a little bit messy after the parents were gone. He killed a man, very nearly two others, before he was killed himself. They're all dead and buried now. What's the son's name? His name was Brahms. Did you say Brahms? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to keep it from you, I just... didn't think it'll ever come up. Thank you for telling us. Come on, Jude. It's time to go home. Hey, Joseph. Did you ever find your dog? Yes, I did. I'm afraid Oz was found gutted in the forest. I'm sorry to hear that. So, your parents tell me you've been talking again? Is this your new friend, Brahms? He seems like a very nice friend. What are some of the things you talk about? He tells me all sorts of things. Sometimes he tells me about the other families he's lived with. Oh, has he lived with a lot of families? He wants to live with us now. He was very angry that Mommy and Daddy wanted to take him away. Oh... And when Brahms gets angry does he say he wants to hurt someone or something? Is there something he wants to tell your Mom and Dad? Well, if Jude had something to do with the dog's death, then... this is a lot more serious than we thought. The doll might be enabling him to shift plain for all the bad things that he might do. I think it would be a good idea for me to see him face-to-face. When do you think you can bring him down to London? We've got guests coming today. -We'll bring him as soon as we can. -All right then, but I urge you keep a close eye on him in the meanwhile. Jude, everyone's here. -Emily, girls, it's all right here. -All right. Thank you. Oh, such fabulous! I love it. Hello. Well, look, there he is. You remember your old uncle Liam, don't you? -Hey. -What? It's not my fault he's mental. And... who's this handsome chap? Brahms. Well, hello there, Brahms. Please to meet you. Any friend of Jude's is a friend of mine. Okay children, why don't you go outside and play while we... -we'll have a catch up. -Yes. -There's nothing to do outside. -There's nature. All right? It's like a video game but real. Go, enjoy. Come on, Jude. Show them around. -Maybe I should go with them. -Oh, nonsense. They'll be fine. Just stay close to the house, guys. -This is so cool. -Shut up! I like your doll. Thanks. This place sucks. There's nothing to do here. We could play croquet. I wanna play, come on. Don't touch him, Sophie. He's mental. No, I'm not. Our parents say you talk to that doll. Like it's a real person. Because you weren't crazy when your mom was attacked. And... we're not supposed to notice. Will! But they know you're mental, and I know you're mental. And your stupid doll is the most mental of all. He's fine, Liza. Have some wine. Will do him good to hang out with some other children. Yeah. I'm sorry. Ever since it happened I just... I can't seem to... relax. Hey, you're with family now. You don't have anything to worry about. And Will won't let anything happen. Hey, you're breaking it! Shut up, nutter. Stop it, Will! You stick up for your nutter boyfriend now? Maybe I should just smash your doll? Maybe that would make you normal again? Don't. We get to this party, and we have literally just walked in the door. And his pants split right in the bum. And not just a little tear, the whole bum. -I'm going to tell mom! -She'll probably be happy. Don't touch him! Or what? We will make you wish you never came here. -Did you buy him purple boxers? -I did. Kinky. Oh, it's good to see that smile again, Liza. That old smile of yours. -Give that back! -No, I don't think I will. -Give it back to her! -Give it back! Now your boyfriend's mad. Why don't you come and get it from me, mental? You know I wouldn't worry about this doll thing. Will used to be obsessed with this blanket. -Run mental, run. -Stop it, Will! Obsessed. And then, one day I realized that it was quite literally a security blanket. And I think this doll could be the same thing. Come on, mental. You shouldn't worry about it is what I'm saying. Kids do all sorts of weird things. They go through phases, and then poof, it's gone. -Oh my God! -What? What's going on? Will! On three. One. Two. Three. Slowly, slowly. Mary, help with his head, okay? Will, I'm coming to get you. Sophie, get in the front. Sweetheart. Why don't you drink some of this, it will help you sleep. A nap will do you good. Okay? Here you go. Mommy... Everything's okay. He won't let me go. He wants me to live in the big house with him forever. He said he'd kill you and Daddy if I didn't do it. He said that? When did he say that? He says it all the time. I can't control him anymore. He keeps getting stronger. Well. No one's gonna hurt Mommy and Daddy. And no one's gonna hurt you. Okay? Hey, Liz, it's me. We just saw the doctor. I think Will's gonna be okay. So... I'll call you from the car. Alright? I love you, bye. Not from around here, are you? -I'm staying at the Glennview Estate. -Glennview? Oh, you mean the Heelshire place? Christ, you couldn't pay me money to stop there. -You won't? -You don't know? All family went completely mad out there. It had something to do with their son living inside the walls for years. You see, but that's not the only thing that happened out there. There were other tragedies before. Back in the 50s. A kid killed his own mother and brother. Convinced the doll was speaking to him. And it's still going on. Last year, that city man that bought it after the Heelshires. Went a bit mad, and disappeared. Never heard from again. I saw him. Down in the pub one time. Old crazy Joe. Crazy Joe? That's what people called him, his name was Joseph-- Oh my God, Jude! Jude! Jude! Jude! Didn't have to be like this. Joseph. Is Jude okay? Don't worry, he's safe. Safer now than he's probably been in his life. Why are you here? I'm here because he wants me to be. Who? Brahms. He doesn't like it like this, but you've done it to yourself. I just wanna know where my son is. I will do anything you want just give me-- I want you to listen! He wants you to listen! You asked me why I'm here? It's the same reason that you are. He called me. He calls out to the ones that need him. The damaged ones. He looks inside you. It was just a whisper at first. And after this he came to me. So quiet. And he was in pieces when I found him. Broken. Then the voice said to put him back together. So I did. Then I heard groan inside. Jude must've heard. Jude sure has. Oh, yeah. I don't know what Brahms is, but you can stop this. It's too late. Brahms and Jude are gonna be one, and they'll be beautiful. You see, everybody thought that I was crazy. They thought that Heelshires were just crazy, but no. It's always been the doll. Even before the house, before the Davies-- The ones before that, I found all along, That is he knew that you were coming. He knew your boy would find him. That's why he told me to bury him. They are always so curious, aren't they? The little ones, they're like-- Like moths to the flame. Joseph, where is my son? I wanna see my son! He's in the big house. Jude! Jude! Jude! Jude. Jude? Right here. You're almost there. Just down here. Jude? I know you don't wanna hurt anybody. This isn't you, Jude. Please, put him down. It's going to be okay. Can I hold Brahms? I used to hold you just like this. Let's just put him down. Hello, Mommy. Jude, put the gun down. I'm very angry. You and Daddy haven't getting in the way. We're going to live here now. 'Cause you can't protect us. Protect you from who? Bad dog. Will. And those men from that night. You're right. -We do need Brahms to protect us. -It's too late. You've given us no choice. Goodbye, Mommy. I know Brahms is telling you what to say. Which is why we need to take him home with us. Brahms needs to be a member of our family. And what kind of a family doesn't need a mother? Mom? Jude. What have you done? What have you done? Stay back! It's me he'll punish. I'm the one who didn't protect him. No. Don't. Joseph, Brahms can't hurt you anymore. You don't understand. It will never be over. It's gonna be all right, Brahms. Mom, you're home? Yes, I missed you. -I missed you, too. -Really? -Perfect timing. -Hey. Hey beautiful, how was your day? It was good, I think we might... sign that author I was telling you about. Yeah? Nice. Alrighty. -This looks so good. -Thank you. Wait until you taste it, because I'm pretty confident that this might be the greatest Coq Au Vin I've ever made. I'm not even joking. There's a whole bottle of wine in here, so I'm not sure if.. Yeah, okay, I'll whip you some of it. -Thank you. -Alright. -This looks so good. -Thank you. Oh, just two or three hours of my day, you know, nothing much. Good night, my man. You sleep tight. I love you, sweetie. Love you, too. Good night. Good night, Brahms. I think we'll be happy here if they learn the rules.
