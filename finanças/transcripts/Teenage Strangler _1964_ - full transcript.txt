(bluesy piano over rhythmic percussion) I'm getting more afraid every time I come to meet you here! Now, who's ever gonna find us here at school, and anyway, where else can we go at night to be alone? Don't worry! I am worried, Jimmy, I'm afraid of something. I don't know what it is! Afraid, of who? Your folks'll never know as long as they thing you're with Ann! (bluesy piano over rhythmic percussion) Betty, come on, it's late! I've gotta go home! Betty, will you-- OK, Ann, OK, I'll be right there. Let go, no more, Jimmy, I'll see you again Saturday night. I'm sorry, Ann, but, oh! Hello, Mr. Wilson, what are you doing here, it's so late! I might ask you the same question, young lady. You shouldn't be out this time of night, or any time at night when the school is closed. Look, I'll walk you home, uh, wait right here. I'll be right back in a minute, I'll get my hat and coat and turn off some lights. I'll be right back. Oh, no, no, you don't have to bother, please don't. No, there's no bother at all, I'm finished. Uh, you stay put right here, and I'll walk you home. Come on, let's go without him! No, wait, maybe be oughta do as he says. Do you think he knows about me and Jimmy? Oh, what's the difference, it's too late now. Come on. (lonely, vaguely ominous guitar) (women gasping) I'm beginning to wish we waited for Mr. Wilson. It was your idea to leave. Well, we did. Let's go this way. OK. (vaguely ominous guitar over tense percussion) Come on, Ann, we've gotta go! Oh, really, I can't (sighs). I've got to rest (gasping). Hey, did you hear something? (tense percussion and guitar) No, I didn't hear anything. Look, I'm going, come on! (ominous and tense guitar and percussion) (screams) Betty! (tense rock music) Ann! (man grunting over tense rock music with saucy saxophone) (Betty screams) No, no, no! (tense rock music) (tense rock music with saucy saxophone) (siren blaring over quietly tense guitar) (footsteps pattering over quietly tense guitar) When did you find the body? We got a call about a half an hour ago, Lieutenant, and then she was there, and I investigated. Looks like she got it just like the rest. Yes, it's the, it's the same M.O. Stocking around her neck, lipstick mark on her forehead. Poor kid. What kind of a nut would do something like this? We're still trying to find that out. Three weeks ago, it was the 17-year-old girl in Kenova. Last week, a student teacher at the school, not much older than this kid. Should we take her now, Lieutenant? OK, Doc, you can take off now. (gurney creaking) (doors crunching shut) (engine rumbles to life) (siren blaring) Lieutenant Anderson to headquarters. [Dispatch Officer] Headquarters, go ahead, Lieutenant. We've finished here, they've taken the body to the morgue. [Dispatch Officer] Lieutenant, Captain Murdoch wants to know if you've got any new clues. No, nothing more than before. Best I can figure, it's the same one. Tell Captain Murdoch I'll be in as soon as I've finished around here. Oh, and you, uh, you better have a couple of the boys, uh, down here to help Bill, are you 10-4? [Dispatch Officer] 10-4. OK. Now, you'll have some help, I want you to comb this whole area, check out everything. Streets, houses, everything in sight. I've got some things to attend to at the morgue. (lonely, vaguely ominous guitar) (siren blaring) (lonely, vaguely ominous guitar over tense percussion) N-no, no use, we don't know who it was, but it made no sense until this morning. Yes, we called the police. As a matter of fact, we're expecting them at any moment! (doorbell rings) The doorbell's ringing, that must be them now. I've got to hang up! Yes, yes, I'll call you later. (phone rattling) (doorbell ringing) Oh! I'm Lieutenant Anderson, Homicide Division. Oh, only one of you? (birds chirping) I'm Betty's mother, Mrs. Royson, we've been expecting you. They phoned you'd come. Let's go into the living room, my husband's in there. (door rattling) Dear, this is Lieutenant Anderson. It's nice of him to come, isn't it? How do you do, Lieutenant? Now, I knew a policeman once, back in my home town. His name has Herdeson also. The name I have is Anderson. Mr. Royson, I'm here on police business. Sit down, won't you? Terrible thing last night, we could hardly understand Betty at all. Mr. Royson, I'd like to talk to your daughter, now. She had a rough time last night. I don't think she's up yet. Listen, she's lucky she can wake up. Would you get Betty, please? I'd like to ask her some questions. Of course, Lieutenant, I'll get her right away. Would you have any idea who it might be, Lieutenant? How 'bout some coffee? No, thank you, I'll pass this time. From what you informed us last night, your daughter didn't get a positive identification. Well, that's what she said. What time did your daughter get home last night? Well, I really don't know for sure. You see, my wife and I were out at the time. I see. Yes, we were at the Frederick, a business meeting, you know. Well, the first call came in around two a.m. Is that right? Well, that's when we came home. I believe it was you who called here later. Yes, sir, that was around three a.m. Quite a night between calls. I had to stay home today from my business. Oh, it's frightening to think a thing like this could almost happen to your daughter. It happened to someone's daughter, Mr. Royson. Someone's daughter who was out with your daughter until all hours of the night. Now, see here, Lieutenant. I've told my daughter she has to be in by 10 p.m. We can't watch over her like an old mother hen. Why pick on my innocent little girl who was almost killed last night herself? Nobody's picking on your daughter, Mr. Royson, but you and every other parent in town have known about these attacks, and it's your responsibility to watch out after your kids! And your responsibility, too. You're getting paid for it, Lieutenant. That's your job as a cop! And what's your job as a parent? Oh, I do hope you and the lieutenant are getting on real well! Uh, Betty will be down in just a moment, Lieutenant. Can I get you a cup of coffee or something? No, thank you, Ma'am. Dear, did you tell the Michaelsons we won't be over this evening? This has been quite a shock to both of us, Lieutenant. We really do feel as though we should stay home with Betty tonight, that is right, isn't it Lieutenant? Come in , Betty, sit down here. I'd like you to tell me everything you can about last night. Yes, sir, I understand. It's just that, it was so horrible, I didn't know-- There, there, dear! Please, Mrs. Royson, let me handle this. Betty, I want you to tell us everything you can. In the first place, why did you come in so late? I, I was with Jimmy last night. Jimmy, how many times have I told you I don't want you running around with that wild kid? Jimmy is not wild! Mr. Royson, let me do the talking! Yes, Lieutenant. Please, Mrs. Royson, I'd like to talk to Betty. Betty, where were you last night? Well, Jimmy and I drove around a bit. I'd planned to meet Ann at the school. We were going to tell our folks that we'd been working at the library. That is, Ann and I met at the school about 12:30, one o'clock. Betty, we're dealing with a thrill-killer, a madman, if you, if you can remember anything! Lieutenant? Yes? It, it couldn't have been one of the kids. It couldn't have, could it? I don't know, whoever it is is familiar with the area. Probably knows what most of you do. It's just that, oh, it couldn't have been one of the kids! Why do you say that, Betty? Well, the gang, the Fast Backs. The hot rodders, the fast bunch she goes out with. Yes, sir, what about them? I remember hearing Ann scream, and I was walking just a bit ahead. What then, Betty? The club has these white emblems on their jackets, and, well, I, I turned for just a second, and it looked like (whimpers), oh, but it couldn't have been one of the kids, Lieutenant, it couldn't have! They wouldn't hurt Ann like that! What is the emblem you think you saw? But I'm not sure, it could have been anything, I don't know! Betty, what do you think you saw? A bulldog, Lieutenant! I might have seen a bulldog (sobs)! (twangy rock music) Hey, Lily, gimme a hot chocolate, will ya? Hey, Marty, how 'bout two burgers and a pear! Coming up, Nicky! One floating high hot special, Marty! With two spoons or one? Three! OK, you'll get one. Three! (rhythmic and twangy rock music) Hey, how 'bout one more of those, Marty! Hey, on the cuff! Sorry, Tony, no credit without we had a chance to check your references. We checked it, Marty, it's rotten. Aw, shut up! Quiet, Runt, or I'll step on ya! Leave him alone, Mike. Hey, Marty, it's OK, I'll pay for it. OK. (sneakers squeaking on floor) Sit down, Runt. You joining us at the races tonight, Jim? I don't think so, Curly. Kind of figured you'd shut down. You weren't there last night either. I know, but-- Look, either you're gonna drag it, or you're gonna drop it-- Look, w-why don't you just lay off, Curly? You know what happened last night! So what? Why, you jerk, Betty almost got killed, too! For the very last time, Runt, shut up! Look, Curly, why don't you keep your fat-- (slaps thwacking) Hands off, little man! You two break it up in here, you got anything to settle, settle it outside. (rhythmic and twangy rock music) Hey, gang, come on, Jack! Hi, Mary. Hey, Jimmy, I'm, I'm sorry about last night. Betty OK? I haven't seen her yet, but I guess so. She wasn't in any of her classes today. (muffled chatter over rhythmic and twangy rock music) Hey, you ready, Jack? Almost, baby cakes. (group chattering) Citizens, citizens! Hey, Mary, Mary, don't scratch the counters! (group shouting and groaning) Fellow citizens and lovers of good music, for those of you who pledge your allegiance to Peter, Paul, and Mary, (group clapping and cheering) those of you who have undying love for The Beatles, (group clapping and cheering) King, Queen, (group clapping and cheering) Paul Anka, (group cheering) not to mention the Chad Mitchell Trio, (group clapping and cheering) I proudly introduce you to Mary and Jack, The Huntington Astronauts! (group cheering) We're out of this world, (group chuckles) and here's our newest record sensation, just released on an RCA Victor label.

I'm Lieutenant Anderson from Homicide. (group chattering) All right! (slap thwacking) Now, most of you know what happened last night. Well, we've reason to believe that someone here might be involved. (group shouting and chattering) Hey, Jimmy, what's goin' on? Look, just don't say anything, Betty was not with me last night, all right? Yeah, OK, but, uh. Young man! Who, uh, who me, sir? Yes, if you've got something to say, I'd like to hear it! Oh, no, n-no, sir. You, you, you and you, c'mere. Wait a minute. Whose jacket is this? What jacket? All right, now, somebody here owns this jacket. And that, that's mine, Officer. Yeah, I, I hung it there when I came in. What's your name? Tony Menes. You're, uh, you're sure this is your jacket? Yes, sir, yeah, that's right. Uh-huh, then how come the label says Jimmy Walton? 'Cause it's mine, Lieutenant, it's my jacket. He was just trying to cover for me. All right, you five, let's take a ride with me. Come on. (rhythmic and twangy guitar) All right, boys, get in there! (hinge creaking) (door cracking) Hi, Deputy, where's the sheriff? He's gone to the television station to broadcast a warning. OK, tell him I'll let him know if there's anything new. Yes, sir. (door rattling) Hey, knock it off! (boys shouting) All right, hold it down in here, hold it down! (boys chattering) Lieutenant, can't you just give us a ticket and let us go home? Yeah, c'mon, yeah! Listen, a girl was murdered last night, another one half scared out of her wits. If you think this is a comedy, you're crazy! You're saying you think one of us had something to do with all this? I'm not saying anything. Now sit back, and be quiet! I'll be right back. Ooh, big man, yeah! (men chuckling and chattering) Man, that guy really bugged me. Ah, get off it, Curly. Hey, look, we know none of us had anything to do with it. Yeah, but where we dragged last night isn't sanctioned. It's you, you weren't even there. So what, I know where I was. Are you gonna tell me where you were? Yeah, Curly, we could get arrested for draggin' there-- Yeah, man, what a mess! I told ya we shouldn't have last night. Cool it! I got a plan. Your parents have been called, they're coming after you. Hey, man, we're getting paroled! Aw, man, I'd rather stay here than face the old man! (slap cracking) All right! Look, Lieutenant, you still haven't told us what this is all about. First, I wanna know how many more in your group. Well, whatta you mean, sir? I mean this club you belong to, these jackets. What do you call yourselves? Fast Backs, the number one group in the state. Oh, yeah, the Fast Backs. Well, how many are there? J-just five, man, but we're the best. Really, best what? Drag, man, none can touch us. (group mimicking roaring engines) All right! Are there any more jackets like this? Well, lots of guys at school wear 'em. But not with a bulldog, that's ours, strictly! Knock it off, Curly. Yeah, maybe you better, it's just possible one of you wearing these was seen last night. Seen where? You tell me where. Man, I sure hate to face my old man! What about you? I wasn't with them. Well, where were you then? Well, my dad thought I was in my room, but I snuck out and met my girl. Well, why were you supposed to be in your room? My father found out I joined the Fast Backs, and he grounded me. So you joined this group? Yes, sir, but I wasn't with 'em last night. I met my girl. But that still doesn't account for your whereabouts at the time of the murder. Right, right after I left Betty at the school, I went on home! Did your folks see you? No, sir, I climbed back in through the window. I mean, they didn't even know I was gone, I guess. Lieutenant, their parents are here. All right, I want you to remind their parents we're releasing these boys in their custody. Yes, sir. On your feet, boys. Man, I think I'd rather be arrested than face my old man! All right, boys, follow me. Wait a minute, Jimmy. Son, you got troubles unless there's something else you wanna tell me. There's nothing I can tell you. All right, Jimmy, but I want your promise. No sneaking out, no seeing your girl, and we'll let you go home with your folks. And now, here's Sheriff Frankel of Cabell County with a special message to all parents. Parents and teenagers of Cabell County, last night a third child was victim of a dastardly crime. Somewhere in this city, a madman is preying on teenage girls. The police department and your sheriff's office are doing their best to stop it. We urge you not to try to take the law into your own hands. This is a civilized community. All officers have been directed to arrest anyone found bearing unlicensed arms or weapons. We urge you, stay home, stay safe, thank you. You just heard a special announcement brought to you as a public service by Channel 13. We now return to our regularly scheduled programming. (pleasant piano music over shuffling jazz percussion) Is that you, John? Yes, and I've got Jimmy with me. Just a minute, I'm turning the set off. I'm coming right down. Dad! (footsteps thudding) I just heard the sheriff's warning, it's terrible, John! Yes, and our son is involved. Jimmy, you? Mom! Now, look, young man, you get upstairs, and you stay there! But, Dad-- Don't but Dad me! What kind of a son have I got? You won't even give me a chance! Give you a chance, you've got a short memory! Hey, Mom! Uh, Mom, can I bring some of the kids over, oh, hi, Jimmy, this afternoon, maybe we can do something-- Mikey, get upstairs. All right. Well, what did I do? Get upstairs! All right. Now the whole ugly mess will come out again. I thought by moving to Huntington that I'd spare your mother and I the embarrassment of the neighbors knowing that our son was a thief! But no, you had to race hot rods, had to sneak out in the middle of the night! John, maybe-- Maybe nothing! Now you listen and you listen straight! You'll stay in your room from now on in. I'll drive you to school, I don't know what kind of a mess this is going to turn out to be. I don't know what we're going to do, but by Jupiter, you'll stay in your room this time! I'll drive you to school, your mother will come and pick you up, and then into your room. Now, now get upstairs, and you stay there! And leave Mikey alone! John, what are we going to do? I don't know. I just don't know, June. (knocking on door) What? It's me, Jimmy. Can I come in? No. Please? Dad said no. Dad went back to the office, and Mom's next door. (snivels) Please, let me come talk to you, Jimmy! (sniveling) Please? All right, but stop your sniffling! Here. What are you gonna do? Rot in this room, I guess. I don't know. Jimmy? I'm sorry. It's not your fault. But Dad's so upset! Yeah, I guess I can't blame him much. But it's all my fault! Look, Runt, we said we'd never talk about it. But I gotta, Jimmy, I just gotta. It's my fault you're in this mess now! Your fault, you didn't sneak out last night. But you didn't steal that bike! No, and you didn't either! I should've told 'em then. I only borrowed it because, because you wouldn't let me use yours. I didn't steal it, honest! I know ya didn't. But you didn't either. Why didn't you just tell them? Look, we promised, it's over. Let me tell the folks, please! No, you think it would make any difference now? Look, I'll be all right. Do you wanna upset them even more? Just leave it be, leave me be! Get outta here! (bed rattling) Hey, I'm sorry, hey, c'mon Mikey! (Mikey sobbing) Huh, I'm sorry. (Mikey whimpering) Hey, look, do you really wanna do me favor? Yes. Will ya take this note to Betty for me? Only don't let anyone see you give it to her. OK. You just deliver this. I, I'll take it to her right now. Hey, tell her, uh, tell her I hope she's OK. All right. (birds chirping over pleasant and twangy rock guitar) (doorbell ringing over pleasant rock guitar) Yes? Is Betty home, Mrs. Royson? It's important, honest, I've gotta talk to her. Well, I'll see, you wait here. (footsteps clacking) (door rattling) Betty, Betty? Yes, Mother? There's a young man to see you. I'll be right down. (gasps) You're in! She'll be right down, wait here, young man. (footsteps clacking) (door rattling) Who is it? Oh. What do you want? I-I'm sorry about what happened, Betty, but, but Jimmy didn't do it! Jimmy didn't do what, who said he did? Police, they're sayin' he did it. He gave me this for you. He was with me, I told them that. (paper rustling) Mikey, tell him I'll sneak out tonight. Tell him I'll meet him at Marty's. Oh, OK, but he's not supposed to go out. I'm not supposed to see him either. Just tell him I'll be there. OK, but, I'll tell him, Betty. I'll tell 'im. (pleasant strumming guitar) (door rattling) (peppy rock music with saucy saxophone) Hi Tony, Elaine. Hi. Hi, Betty, how you feelin'? Oh, OK, I guess, gee, that's a nice song. Marty brought the combo in. Wants to give the place some class. (laughs) They're good. Hey, uh, hey, can I get you something? Oh, no, I don't think so. Well, how 'bout a sip of my pop. I mean, there's nothing in it. Am I the only drink that can make that statement. (group chuckling) Betty, can we get you anything? Oh, no, thank you, Marty. Kay then, how you doin', kid? Fine. Uh-oh, here comes trouble! Well, hi, patty cake, how bout wrestling this one with me? No, I don't think so, Curly. Come on, I'll help you shake your blues. Hey, the lady says no! You got a real bad memory, Runt! Now, come on. Look, man, why don't you leave her alone! Look, Runt, I'm gonna have to play teacher and learn you a lesson you'll never forget if you open your mouth just one more time! Now you sit back! (cup rattling) Why don't you let her alone, you know she's Jimmy's girl! Yeah, well Jimmy's been grounded, see? He's all cooped up, and this little bird can still fly. (slaps cracking) (Tony groaning over shrieking women and chatter) Give me room! (group shouting and chattering) Hey, Marty, I'm gonna mop your floors! The Runt here's elected head mop! You'll have to start with me, Curly, if you think you're big enough! I was only kidding. You and your buddies get outta here and don't come back, do ya hear? Eh, service stinks anyways! Curly, you owe me 30 cents for three drinks. Bill me. Where, in the hospital? 30 cents, cash, no credit! You and me still got a mopping date! Out! Looks good. (Tony gasping) Come on, let me help you, it's all right. (Tony gasping over distant car horns honking) Yeah, I'm all right, I'm all right. Hey, hi, Jimmy. Sit down, Jimmy, I'll see you kids later. What, what happened to you? Aw, nothing. Curly, he got fresh with Betty. Oh, it was nothing, M-Marty threw him out. Look, do you two mind? Eh, no, sure, we know, three's a crowd, four's a jam. Hey, come on, doll, I'll buy ya a pop and take ya home. (muffled pop music with female vocal) He's really a nice guy. So are you, Jimmy. Oh, what are we going to do? Nothing. I mean, I gotta leave Huntington. But why, you didn't do anything? I know, but they think I did. I've got my stuff packed. Where are you going? I don't know, I'll get a job somewhere, I'll write you! Jimmy, please! You know, if my folks found out that I was with you tonight, I'd never get out again, but I just had to see you. Me, too, I just had to tell ya that-- Tell me what? Look, I know things are a mess now, but someday they'll straighten out! I'll come back, I mean, will you wait for me? Oh, you know I will, but running away isn't going to help! Well, what am I gonna do? Jimmy, I love you. If you love me, I don't know what I'd do. Me, too, honey. I got in trouble once before. It wasn't my fault, but now it looks like (sighs) they blame me for these things. You know it wasn't me you saw that night! No, I just saw the jacket. Oh, I don't know what I saw. Look, lemme take ya home. I gotta think, maybe if I walk or somethin'. ♪ Darkness clutched ♪ ♪ The night and day ♪ ♪ Every dream I've kept ♪ ♪ And that when you said goodbye, dear ♪ ♪ On the day the willows wept ♪ (crowd applauding) (crickets chirping) Yeah, I told you the keys would be under the mat back here.

No, they're down the street visiting neighbors. Well, is Jimmy in his room? Yes, Jimmy's upstairs, he's confined to his room. Well, would you, would you get him please? Certainly, just a moment.

(relaxed and pleasant rock guitar) (siren blaring over pleasant rock guitar) (relaxed and pleasant rock music) Hey, Mr. Wilson, whatta you think about what happened last night? I think it's terrible. You kids oughta have better sense! You mean like you, Mr. Wilson? You really clean up on your job. Jimmy didn't do anything, I know it. Sure, just wanted to go for a joy ride! Kids nowadays! (distant traffic humming) Isn't that, it's just awful! Isn't that, it's just awful! (footsteps clacking) Hi, Mikey, what are you doing here? Betty, I gotta talk to ya, I just gotta! Sure. Betty, you gotta help him! You gotta! Who, what are you talking about? You mean you don't know about Jimmy? What about Jimmy? He got arrested last night 'cause he wasn't home! Another girl got killed and he wasn't home, so they arrested him! I know he went home, he promised me! I know, but, but the police came just as he, well, he got scared and drove, drove off in Dad's car. When they caught him, he said he couldn't tell 'em where he was, he just couldn't! Oh my gosh, he was with me! I know, but he won't tell them! Oh, it's all my fault! I told him I'd get into trouble! Betty, what are we gonna do? We can't let him get blamed, what are we gonna do? There's only one thing we can do, c'mon. (students chattering) Yes, Captain, yeah, we caught him, but he won't say anything, just that he didn't do it, and he won't tell us where he was. What, well, he says he ran off 'cause he was scared, and Captain, you know something? I kinda believe him. I don't know why, but, but something's wrong. (muffled chatter) Lieutenant, there's a couple of kids out here to see you. OK, show 'em in. Yes, sir. Betty, son, come on in. Come on, Betty. Lieutenant Anderson (snivels), he didn't do it! He didn't do it, he was with me last night! The reason he didn't tell you was 'cause he knew I'd get into trouble if my folks found out that I'd sneaked out! But he didn't do it, Lieutenant, he was with me! And he didn't steal no bike, neither! I did! He, he just wanted to, to (sobs). Now, hold it, just calm down. Get control of yourself! (Betty and Mikey sobbing) Sergeant, bring James Walton up here. Now, come on in and tell me the whole story. Come on, come on. (Betty and Mikey gasping) (twangy strumming guitar) Well, if ain't the little hero. Heard you gave 'em quite a chase last night. They never woulda caught me. Maybe it's better this way. The offer still goes, baby. Wanna drop slowpoke here, my chariot is gassed and ready. Well, why don't you just hop in and get on outta here then, and take this with ya! (twangy strumming guitar) (crowd shouting and chattering) Stop it! Break it up or I'll report you to the principal! Oh! (crowd chuckles) Man, I'll take you on any other way, too! Yeah, well I get my kicks from speed, if you've got the nerve! I got it. You talk big but you don't put up! I'll outrun you just like before. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Let me go.

(rhythmic and bluesy piano over shuffling percussion) (engine rumbling) (rhythmic and bluesy piano over shuffling percussion) (locker rattling) (Betty gasps over cracking thud) Oh, oh, Mr. Wilson, you frightened me! What are you doing here? Oh, I'm trying to find something (sighs) or not find it or something. What are you mumbling about? I have to check Curly's locker. He said he left something in there. (gasps) Oh, Mr. Wilson, it's terrible. Well, now we'd better open the locker. I have a master key. (locker rattling) (gasps)Oh my gosh! What is it? The emblem, it was in his locker! Child, I don't have a notion of what you're talking about! I found the emblem! Oh, Jimmy might've killed him, oh, Mr. Wilson! Now, child, just calm down. Come, we'll go into my office room, and I'll fix you a cup of tea. Oh, what are we going to do? Just calm down. (hinge creaking) (locker thuds shut) Now, you sit, and while I'm fixing us some tea, you tell me just what it was you found. Who got hurt? Uh, Jimmy, oh, I, I mean, I mean Curly. Uh, you see, the emblem on his jacket was missing, and they found one by Jane Houstead, and we thought, but he didn't, he didn't do it. I know he didn't do it, Mr. Wilson! (Betty gasps) Mr. Wilson? (vaguely ominous guitar) (jacket crinkling) This is, this is Jimmy's! But, but Tony threw it a, away. The emblem, it's-- I found the jacket, child. The emblem was already off. You, it's (gasping), (vaguely ominous guitar) but when he threw it away, it wasn't! Oh, Mr. Wilson, I wanna go home, please. (tense cymbal roll) No. Please! You don't want to go home just yet. Please, Mr. Wilson! (vaguely ominous guitar) Oh, you're saying, "Please, Mr. Wilson!" Yes, all of a sudden, it's please, Mr. Wilson. Your bunch doesn't usually say please! Well, Mr. Wilson won't please! Why, why! Why, it was a student just like you years ago. She said, I used to be a teacher then. You see, she said I tried to touch her. I wasn't even near, but the school board wouldn't listen. Now, look where I am, Mr. Wilson, the janitor! Do you think I like it? You think I like cleaning up after a bunch of grubby kids like you? I hate it, I hate you! Every one of you! Please, but the jacket I saw that first time! Oh, this one? I forgot about the paint smear, but in the dark, it might've looked like a bulldog, and that gave me the idea. They might have thought it was one of you, but no. You had to-- (Betty screams) (tense rock music with saucy saxophone) Jimmy! You two keep back! (Betty gasps) They'll never know. (tense rock music) (Betty gasping over tense rock music) (Betty screams) (glass shattering) (gunshot cracking) (tense rock music with saucy saxophone) (gunshots cracking) (Betty gasping and whimpering) He did it, he was crazy! He killed all those girls! It's over, honey, it's over. It's all over now. (Betty gasping) Thank goodness you boys had the good sense to call me. (bluesy piano) (peppy rock music) I understand Curly gets outta the hospital today. Yeah. It's our fault, isn't it? I don't know what to say to him. Hey, look, it's Lieutenant Anderson! Got a friend of yours with me. Marty, all right? Sure, bring him in. (peppy rock music with saucy saxophone) Here, sit down, Curly. Thank you. (peppy rock music) This one's on the house. Thank you, Marty. Hey, gang, look who's givin' credit! (all clapping and cheering) Just for him and just today. Aw, boo! (group groaning) All right, all right, I'll set 'em up for everybody. (group clapping and cheering) And I'll dance with you later. (group laughing) (rhythmic and peppy rock music with saucy saxophone)
