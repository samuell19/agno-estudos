I am such an idiot. Scotch bonnet? Habaneros. Ooh, you know what, I am kind of celebrating. So I think that'd be just what I need. I'll put your order right in. Hello? Hi sweetie, huh? I'm so proud of you. Yeah, so how is aunt Skiv? Oh, she's a saint. All right listen, let's just talk about it when I get home. I'll be there tomorrow. All right, I love you. Okay, bye bye. Look at that. - Isn't she sweet? - Sure is. Here you go. The chef said he went a little overboard on the seasoning so take it easy. If it's too hot, I can get you another one. - Oh! Sorry, I'll get that cleaned up. Don't worry about it. These salt water vaders from the ocean have somehow adapted to fresh water. It's believed they migrated from the ballast tanks of ocean going ships. Now, once the ships are here, they dumped their water. Well, whatever happens to be in their ballast tanks. And there you go. These disgusting rows of circular teeth actually attach on the sword fish, mostly lake trout and to make matters worse, their saliva is an anti-coagulate. That's right, as long as they're attached to a fish, - the fish bleeds. - That is disgusting. No matter how hard the fish tries to shake its parasitic friend, it's up to the eel to let go. That doesn't happen very often. Most of the time an eel will eventually kill its host. Reporting live from the harbor, Emily Richett. Hello? Oh, hi Liz. Yeah, I should be in Chicago by eight. I guess, sure, I can just pop in. I'll make it a quick visit. All right, hang on. What's that? Stubbs Road, oh I don't know but I can find it. All right, have a good weekend, bye. What the hell's going on down there? Holy! Oh stop, stop it, stop, stop! No! So who are you? Your piano just fell on my car. Easy lady, I was gonna put it in the lounge. This is one messed up car. Hey, are you with that preservation thing? - Yeah, I am. - Oh, this sucks. Hey, I hope you don't hold this against me. This is just nuts. You shouldn't have parked here. Dog gone cables been causing me trouble all summer. Never expected to give away in one fell swoop. Oh, you think? Oh man, it's like walking under a ladder you know. Or, a black cat. Oh, like I need another repair project around here like a hole in my head. It's gonna be a bitch getting that back up. You got insurance, right? How are you gonna help me? I'm sorry, I'm Viglan Mount Morenci Schaffer. You can call me Vigs. What are you gonna do to make this right? - I don't know. - Huh? I'll think of something. What if I hadn't gotten out of there? That would have been bad. Oh, I'm really sorry about your car. Can you call me a taxi? No, they won't come this far out. Oh, I was just gonna whip in here and write a half page report. And then I was gonna get back- - Yeah well, hey, I'd give you my car, but I don't have one so. Okay, all right. Liz, it's Paula. Yeah, my car broke down and I'm kind of stuck at the ship site. Can you call me back? It's 5:05, they just closed for the weekend. That's just, that's right. Hey, I could make some calls. Maybe find you something? It's the least I can do. Yeah, yeah, well that would be great. Okay, I have some numbers inside. What is that? Oh, they're plenty of floaters around here. They always get stuck right there between the boat and the dock. Well, but how come? That's just doesn't seem right. They get pretty stinky even for me and I'm used to some pretty smelly stuff around here. When I get the time I scoop 'em up and bury 'em. Here, follow me. That's funny, my phone numbers were by the paint. So how long have you been on this boat? Oh, I sailed her when I was a kid. Yeah, when it was in Europe. I was over there with my pop, no kidding. When it ended up here, I had the time so I kind of became a guardian. Yeah, I'd say you'd have a lot of history here. Oh, I'd say so. I worked every station to know more about a 350 feet than anyone alive. Ah, here we go. Doc Samuels will have something. - Your phone? - Yeah, good. No reception, I can never get a signal on this steel ship. That's why I don't own one. Oh, plus your battery's almost dead. Yeah, I know, I know, but there's probably enough there - for a couple of calls. - Okay. Hey Doc, it's Vigs. I was wondering if you had a car I could borrow for the weekend? Come on by if you do, okay thanks. Doc might've had something. Like I said, I got plenty of room here. Wait no, I've got a road service card in here. Yeah okay, give me the phone. I don't know why I didn't think of this to begin with. I guess you could try and find a room in town but you know, it's like 15 miles. Yeah I know, I remember 'cause I drove it when I had a perfectly good car. Oh, come on! If it makes you feel any better, I drop stuff in the water all the time. Sooner or later, everything falls in the water around here. I'm gonna need a copy of the motion from your board of directors requesting the nomination. Then, what? You know what I'm talking about, right? I mean, you have a board of directors, right? Oh, not exactly. I mean, I'm trying to get some friends together. Oh no, no, no. You see, this designation can only be awarded to an actual non-profit organization that's recognized by the IRS. This is definitely a nonprofit. No, I'm talking about an actual- - Okay listen, I just read that you guys were giving away like 10 million bucks to fix up old stuff like this that's why I signed up. All right, well, I'm just gonna make a note that you're not incorporated. Whoa come on, give me a break huh? What are you doing? You know, I'm not even supposed to be here. The very first question they ask is the nonprofit thing and without that, you've got nothing. Now look, you can do a little more work here but it's gonna take a lot before I can recommend you to the program. Are you all right? No, no I'm not. I think I should be going. Look sir, if you wanna reapply once you have it all together, I think you should because it's kind of a neat project. Hello, hello? I was wondering if I could take you up on your offer? Come on in. Okay, just something simple. It's nice to have some company around here, welcome aboard. Thanks, okay, all right. Okay, thanks. I knew you'd come back. Oh, you're gonna love it here. Got plenty of rooms so take your pick. That one right there is probably the best of the bunch, executive suite. Oh no, please. Wow, a sink. Does it work? Pretty much, the water pressure can be a little flaky, but you do have a light. That's great, okay. Well, it's Vigs right? Yup, yup, my room is right down there, number 10. Oh, you actually live on this boat? Oh, are you kidding? Taking care of this old gal's a full-time deal. - I bet. - I called this boat home for I don't know, 12, 13 years. Oh seriously, even in the winter? Yup, it gets crisp that's for sure. A bunch of cold, frozen steel, damp too. It got so bad a couple of winters ago, I fired up one of the main boilers. It made a hell of a lot of smoke, but it did cut the chill a little. Must've burned through 5-600 gallons of old fuel oil just to do it. That's very resourceful. Now I just keep a little electric heater in my room. Oh, that's great. Right, well listen, I'm just gonna get settled so do you have a bathroom? Oh yeah, out here. Take the hallway to the left, turn right. It usually works pretty good. Watch for the splash. I'll get you some towels and stuff. Okay, thanks. Right, okay, I'm fine thanks. I'll be having dinner in the galley at eight. Hope you're hungry. Oh no, no, no, I couldn't impose. You see, I brought my own stuff, but thanks. It's just as easy for me to make dinner for two. That's fine, then I will try to stop by. Good, good, oh good! Yeah, the galley's right straight down there. Just follow the delicious smell of home cooking. Almost ready. Smells kind of good. What is it? It's kind of a bratwurst deal. I eat 'em all the time. It has most of the food group in 'em, meat, butter. Help yourself to a beer. No, not that cooler, no. This one here. Have you noticed that this water smells kind of- - Sweet? I guess. Yeah, well that's cause last winter, I poured some antifreeze in the pipes. Seemed like a good idea at the time. It's poisoned. Maybe, but I've been running fresh water through the whole ship for months so I wouldn't worry about it. I know, I know. I should have probably just drained the damn thing. Believe me, it would've been a hell of a lot easier. But on the other hand, sweetness is goodness as long as you have a good dentist. You know, I think I'm just gonna stick with this one thanks. Suit yourself. I swear, I never get tired of these. It has kind of a gamey flavor. Where'd you get it? In town. At the gas station? No, those are horrible. I like my job here. When you say job, do you mean you get paid? I get by yeah. But the perk is that I get to live on this huge thing. What a deal. How about you? You like your job? Actually, I do. You know, I get to go out. I get to see amazing places and meet just interesting people. I bet that's true. They're a lot of weirdos out there. What? Have you been out long? A couple of years. I used to work for the city Chicago. Come on, this doesn't have a gamey taste to you? Guess I'm kind of used to it. What's the matter? I'm full. Oh, you gotta be kidding, you sure? Pretty sure. Your loss. What's the matter. I swear, sometimes I see stuff around here. No, it's nothing. What do you mean you see stuff? No, I'm probably more superstitious than the next guy being a sailor and all. What does superstitious have to do with anything? Listen, this boat's had a lot of adventure. You know a lot of.. Dammit, there it is again, that's it! Welcome to my world. You're funny. Had you going huh? You know, these bratwurst, they just don't agree with me. Oh, help yourself to more beer. It's like medicine. Do you have any ginger ale over there? Nope, just beer. Now I just feel terrible. What is in this? Are you feeling alright? Oh, I couldn't be better. Just sit back and let the beer do its magic. See, now you have me going, but I did hear something. We're even. So how did this boat come here anyway? 40 or 50 years ago, she was in Russia, hauling railroad cars. One calm spring afternoon, she drove out into a fog. A couple of days later, she was found drifting. She had a crew of 36. Wasn't a soul aboard when it came out of that fog. Hey, I got no reason to make this stuff up. It happened that way. Huh, empty? Not a living soul. It sounds like the Bermuda triangle. Come on, what's the explanation? There was none. After that, it was hauled to a boat yard in St. Petersburg. Some guy had a big dream of putting it in service here in the U.S. Oh, he went through a lot of trouble. We ran it for a little while. - And? - He died. Fell down the steps in the car deck, busted his neck. Geez, that's awful. I guess that was the end of that dream. Yeah, it would have been a big project. Sure is a beaut though, ain't she? You know, thank you for your dinner. I'm gonna turn in. I'm kind of whipped. A good night's sleep is just what you need. Nitey night. Why are you looking in my room? I heard that noise and I saw your light was on so. - Oh, nevermind. - I was in the bathroom. So what was that? It was loud. I didn't hear it, but I'm sort of used to things around here. This gal is like an old house, it has noises. Well, I am gonna head to my room now. You feeling any better? Oh, a little. Hey, you up for a quick tour? - No, no. - Oh, come on. It'll just take a couple of minutes. It's kind of late for me. Day, night, what's the diff? I'll make it quick, you'll love it. - I guess. - Oh, excellent. I don't get many visitors, you know. Follow me. Look at this construction. She was built in 1931. Try and find carpentry like this nowadays. You know, you've got toothpaste? - What? - It's right here - on your cheek. - Oh, thanks. Imagine a time when there weren't any computers or stuff like that to help out. This was the real deal. I mean, actually I probably could agree 'cause with the preservation- - Come on, check this out. Now, passengers that didn't get a state room, they would hang out in here on deck. But if the weather was bad, they would hang out in here. One year, huge wave came in and busted out all those windows. - Okay. - Come on. The old man would sit over there and here stood the wheelsman. Four hours on, four off. There was no mamby, pamby, autopilot bullshit. Sorry, just steady hand and a sharp eye. She would sail through all kinds of weather. Bust through three feet of solid ice. Did you work up here? No, I was down in the engine room. Away from all of this. Watch your step. It smells bad. Just an old ship that doesn't go out anymore. This is where we all slept. We're actually below the waterline right now. Over here is the engine room. Now, this is what makes a ship. It's just cramped down here. Is that asbestos over there? Yeah, you get used to that. Oh, but when the weather got bad, that was trouble for sure. One time, one of our oilers, McGinty was walking past this electrical panel when he lost his balance. He ended up grabbing hold of one of these old knife switches. That was his last day at sea. That's just horrible. Oh, you're telling me. Cooked him like the Christmas goose, but they were good times and great times. What is that? Who knows, there's water in the bilge. Sometimes it sloshes around funny. It could be that. Hey, over here are the engines. She ran entirely on steam. So powerfully yet so quiet. I'm gonna turn in for the night. Woo, woo, are you okay? I think that food was just rich for me. There's plenty more to see. Right well, some other time 'cause I just gotta get some sleep. I smell like an engine room. That's a good thing. Okay, thanks for your tour. Can you find your way back up? Yeah, I'll be right, I'll be right. If you're sure. I might just stay down here for awhile. Plenty of stuff to do and I'm feeling kind of inspired. How do you stand it down here? Oh, it's like your own breath, kinda familiar. All right, well I'll see you tomorrow. Let me in! Let me in! Open up! What's going on in there? This shit came right out of there. Oh man, I'm really sorry about this. This shower head just got stuck and then I tried to get the wire just to loosen it up. What do you mean sorry about this? Wait a minute, you're not surprised? These pipes, they don't get used to nothing. I realize that. I've been asking you for a raise. And what do you do? You always tell me, "I can't afford to give you a raise." You don't know what you're doing when it comes to this. It should've been finished by now! I'm sorry, I told you I was late because the railroad car. I'll put a rush on it and I'll get it done for you today. And then maybe you'll pay me. Last time, last time. Oh, last time. I told you, I got stuck waiting on a train. I can't go around the thing. It sat there and stopped for 15 minutes! I might as well just fix the thing myself. Oh, morning ma'am, sleep okay? No, actually, no. Oh, this is Mr. Semperton He's here to help with the plumbing. It's gonna be a big job. It's nice to meet you. You got a lot of guts staying on this old vessel. She was up fine boat- All right enough about the boat! You need to get work. All right already, I'm going. He's a pretty good worker. I get 'em over here once in a while when I get into something complicated. That bottle looks like poison. Yeah, yeah, he uses that sometimes, hard to reach places. Hey, you hungry? A little. Yeah. I always have oatmeal and raisins for breakfast. No kidding? Yeah, well it helps with my cholesterol. All right, but then I got to try to figure out how to get back home. Help yourself to some coffee. I'll fix you up a sailor's breakfast. Oh, don't go to any trouble that oatmeal is gonna be just fine. Come on, oatmeal and sausage, doesn't get any better than that. Seriously, that oatmeal is gonna be plenty. Dig in. Well go on, what are you waiting for? It's not bad. I know, I buy in bulk. Now, don't let the sausage get cold, go on. He's supposed to stay away from the wires. Dammit, I'll be right back. Who wants to go see where you drive the boat? Well, come on! Come on, don't you wanna see it? There we go. Why don't you pull the steam whistle? Imagine standing here, hands on the wheel, in control of this ship. Vigs! Vigs, I got something for you, you son of a bitch! Open up, come on! Geez lady, what's with all the excitement? This was in my bed. You went fishing? What's going on in there? - We good here? - No! - I got to go. - What? Hey, what are you doing? What is my computer doing in your room? I can explain that. Paula, wake up! Paula, wake up. Paula hurry please, open the door. Get the hell out of here. Even for me, there's some creepy shit going on out there. You may wanna get your things together. Shit! Vigs? Vigs? Vigs? Morning, you okay? You look like you just seen a ghost. Pretty nice morning huh? Sleep okay? No, no, actually I, why do you keep asking me that? What's with this box? Oh, I use them for trash. They just float off. It kind of sounds like littering. Nah, nobody ever sees them. They sink quick. Crayfish and critters get after them and the wood just rots. Pretty slick system actually, it's underrated. - Hey you hungry? - No. Oh, I made coffee a little while ago. You should get some, come on. Is that blood on your hands? No, no, it's paint. You know, I've had a really weird night here. I think I'm just gonna get my things together and just head home. I mean, don't get me wrong. I appreciate all you've done for me and letting me stay here. Do you have a picture of your daughter? What did you say? Do you have an issue with the water? Do I have an issue with the water? - No, why do you ask? - Fine then. Yeah, you can? That's great, yeah, Stubbs Road. I'm at the dock, that's right. That's great, yeah, I'm ready. It was just easy. I haven't told you everything. Oh, Paula, give me a minute would ya? I need to tell you. I'm real sorry you got mixed up in all this. We're not alone here. The bilge is crawling with those snaky little bastard eels. I can't get rid of 'em. So sometimes I need to get down there and just just give 'em hell. Otherwise they'll take over. As it is, they sneak out and they get into things. Hey! I don't sleep that well either. Okay, a couple of years ago, someone wanted to scrap this ship. Yeah, that would've been a good idea. Yeah maybe, but if those eels get loose in the harbor, they'll breed like rabbits. There's already probably millions of them down there just waiting for the chance. I tried poisoning them. A bunch die and the rest just get tougher. There really are eels on this boat? Oh yeah, lots of 'em. Did those eels have anything to do with that bratwurst you gave me? Does anybody else know about this? No, just you and me. Right, well in a minute it's just gonna be you because I'm leaving. You can keep it a secret. As far as I'm concerned, I dreamt this whole thing anyway. Well, maybe you did and maybe you didn't. Whatever, this is not my business. I'm just gonna get out of here. Paula please, no, no! You know, if this eel thing is truly serious, I can send a specialist out here. I don't want any help. Come on, please let me just send someone. I'm very protective. You can't tell anyone about the eels. Look, as far as I'm concerned, I was never even here. Can't we just talk? Come on Paula, get back here! You can't leave. You can never leave. Geez, missy you startled me. Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat? Do I know you? Scrambled eggs it is. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? I just came for one night. I love midnight meals. The rest of the world just kind of falls away. Simplicity of it, you know. I'm just trying to get some sleep. Sorry, did I wake you? Oh no, it's all right. I have work to do. So do you come here on the boat very often? I have a room down below. I thought that Vigs lived here alone? - Who? - Vigs, you know Vigs? He's the caretaker on this ship. And when I came here yesterday, there was Vigs and he showed me around. I think I'd know if there was someone else on this boat. Okay, see that's him. It's gotta be him. This old boat makes plenty of noises. I'm pretty used to it. Eat your breakfast before it gets cold. He told me that his name was Vigs. We've met before, it was on the deck. They're getting cold. You're the plumber. I've been a lot of things. Something wrong? I can't get used to the water. It's just. There is something crappy about the water on this boat. - I know. - Someday I'll figure it out. Yeah, you know, his room, it was across the hall from mine. - Across from you? - Yeah. Seriously, there's no one else on board. Oh no, that's where he keeps it. Don't look at me like that. Come on, I'll show you. In here. It must've been this one here. All right, what did you do with him? Come on back to the galley. No, no, oh not again. I gotta use the bathroom. Don't get in there. Will you just go, go away! You okay in there? Stop!
