INVISIBLE MAN Special Effects by Eiji Tsuburaya Director: Motoyoshi Oda - Oh no, I did it! - What's wrong? I ran over something. Hey, you can't stop the car here. What happened? - I ran over someone. - What? Don't be stupid. I was watching the whole time. No one was walking. Yes. No one was here. That's strange. I definitely ran over something. A dog or a person. You're a little strange. Huh? It's a dead body! Somebody give me a hand! Call the ambulance! It's a suicide. I found this. Friend, I can no longer keep living. We were transformed into invisible men and used in the name of "invisible special operation agents". What fools we were! We have life, but we have been made invisible. We can't operate in this society. You said that we should keep living but I can no longer stand it. You have hope. I wish that you would continue to live strongly. Everyone, this is the whole story of what happened at 11 a.m. in the center of Tokyo, Ginza 4th Street. The story of a strange suicide. And now, to find new information and to ask for your cooperation, the Chief of the Metropolitan Police would like to speak. Everyone, after investigations, the runover body was confirmed to be indeed an invisible man! This was caused by the former military authorities who for strategic purposes, created a kind of radioactive beam. However, these commando troops that were made up of invisible men had all died in the sea off the island of Saipan. However because of this incident at least two of them miraculously survived. They perhaps led a life in Tokyo. Now that one of them is dead we can conclusively confirm that the other one is still alive. Everyone, in the coming days, if you find any clues about this invisible man, please report to the police station near you. We ask for your co-operation. This concludes the special news about the invisible man. Brought to you by Nihon TV. Do you think it's true? I can't believe it. But it's happening right now. - It's an undeniable fact. - You think so? If an invisible man stabs us we're done for. This is terrible. I'd like to meet him once. You can't try to see something that's invisible. - Let's make another round. - Yup. What disturbing news. Mariko. You are blind, so don't go out alone. There are bread and oranges in the cupboard. Mariko. - Has your grandpa gone out? - Not yet, he's going out now. I see. Hi there. Thanks for always being so good to us. Something's bothering me. Hey. Would you mind looking behind us? Why? For the invisible man. Isn't it following us? How many times do I have to say, we can't see it. - Is the Chief in? - Yes, he's here. Chief, I couldn't find him. Oh, no. Why is that? Dr. Nishizaka who created the invisible ray did indeed exist but he died three years ago. So this trail's gone cold. I see. But, I met then-commander Hayakawa. This is his picture. Nothing concrete came to light though. Well, you are after all the first witness to the incident. I entrust the coverage of the invisible man to you. Keep trying! Yes, sir. Turn the interview with commander Hayakawa into an article. I've already done it. I see... you've been working hard! "Heiwa-So" (Peace House) You must be the clown uncle. Yes, but how did you know? Even though I'm blind, I can tell from the air. Good, bad... or a kind person... Everybody is different. I'm impressed. My grandpa is on night duty again today. How about you? I just have to go get my pay. I'll buy you something on my way home. Cabaret KUROFUNE I am the sad... clown in the town struck by rain and sobbing silently Thinking about the person who will not return and remembering his face I am wandering though I have nowhere to go, toward the light of the city Once autumn, full of loneliness passes and the harsh winter has gone and in the same way the joyous spring comes through To my heart Into my arms You will come back again and I am waiting Using the invisible man as part of your show already. The owner is a shrewd man. Once autumn full of loneliness passes and the harsh winter has gone and in the same way the joyous spring comes through To my heart Into my arms You will come back again and I am waiting Good morning. What is this? How rude! What are you doing? You know what's up. I'm smitten. Who's that? Who the hell are you? Um, I am here to get paid. Idiot! I'm sorry, you were dragged into that. Oh, don't be. But are you...? I'm fine. I don't lose to guys like him! You're from Heiwa-so, right? I've heard about you from Mariko. Is there something? Nothing. We're the invisible men. Be quiet! "Invisible Men Rob the Racetracks" "Gang of Invisible Men Rob the House of a Bank President" "Invisible Gang Steals Medical Drugs from Vessel" Teacher, invisible men have been tied to crime and have become a social problem. I've heard that the inventor, Dr. Nishizaki, was your pupil? Yes, it seems that he was studying those things... Experimenting with proton collision using the Cyclot theory. Which means? The radiation ray that he coincidentally discovered in the experiment was one that can make objects invisible. So it's true. That is... He took the radioisotope of the phosphorus, P33, and gave it continuous impact using ultrahigh- speed protons over a prolonged time. And when he tried to observe the change in the P33... He accidentally discovered it. Can you tell me in more detail? Well so... Transparent quantum that is absorbed by radiation rays... Nishizaki called it "Poston," and by absorbing the Poston you let visible light pass completely through. In other words, you can make humans transparent too. But the problem is... You can't reverse it. According to the salesgirl at the racetrack and the bank president... it is said that the culprit is the survivor of a suicide squad. The total damage until now is recorded as twenty million yen. How are the police going to respond? Is it true, Committee on Judicial Affairs will call upon the Superintendent General? I don't know! Give me a break! If that's the case, I will take full responsibility... And so... I really cannot respond any further. Be quiet please! Mr. Nomura Katsuhiko. I'm not asking about your responsibility. I don't care whether you decide to slit your stomach. Now is not the time to be doing this! I'm asking if you can catch the invisible man or not! We will certainly catch him. Can you really claim something so big? Now, our citizens are... suffering from fear of the stranger's knife! If invisible men tried to overturn the government, or set off dynamite in public places... we cannot see them so we will not know it's happening! Perhaps they are here! Just behind all of you! I'm nostalgic of dreaming of Jennie Just as the gentle daisies... Here, it's done. - I'm sorry to bother you all the time. - Don't mind. Mariko.. You must always be lonely without your Grandpa. No, grandpa works hard... to make money to cure my eyes. You are right. I've been thinking recently... I want to buy something that will keep you from being bored. What do you want? - Oh no, I'm good. - Why? I heard that you are poor. That's not true. I'm a rich man. Well I... actually want a music box. A music box? I had it at home some time ago... My parents bought it for their wedding anniversary... but it got burned during the war and it's gone now. I see. When I listen to that music, I remember my parents. But without it these days, I feel like I might forget them. When you open the box, you can hear the song about Jennie Clown uncle, is the lady across from here still sleeping? The curtains are closed so probably. Leave. This isn't somewhere you should be. I told you I'm the owner's messenger today. It's about the old guy across from you. I've already declined many times. Tell Yajima so. Are you sure? If you reject the owner too much... Leave me alone. I can't believe you'd take advantage of such a good old man. It's humanitarian work. This money will cure her eyes. I won't fall for that. Well, if you say so... Hey kid. - Who are you? - Is your Grandpa here? He is still out for his night shift. What is your business? Well, forget it. Then I will tell him that you rejected. OK? Of course. You're sure then. See ya. Mariko. Good morning. Oh hello! Who was that person? Oh, somebody you don't know. I will soon be able to see your face! Oh, is that so? Grandpa said he'll make money soon. Then I can go to the hospital and have eye surgery. I don't mind how much it costs. Can I order a music box with Jennie's song? Let me try asking the factory. - I need it for Christmas. - Certainly, Sir. What's up? I just can't seem to get a grasp. Of course. You're against the invisible men. Take it easy. Chief, do you have any idea what the invisible men usually do? I assume they eat. Of course. That means... To eat out, they need to appear in public in the ordinary way. I see. Perhaps it's better to look for the visible things rather than the invisible. - Any ideas? - It's not clear to me yet. Sir, wouldn't it be great if we transformed into invisible men and sneak into the women's bathrooms. It's worth more than a strip show. Stop. I don't want to hear about invisible men. Hey, drink one more. Something's happened. - The invisible men broke in! - What? Where? Hamaya Jewelry Shop. - Was it really the invisible men? - Seems so. I work for a newspaper. - A clown came to you today? - Yes, but he was strange. He ordered a music box and left as he eyed everything. Thanks. Thank you for taking time. It's about the sign holder who dresses like a clown. Let's see. Here it is. His name is Takamitsu Nanjo. He lives in Heiwa-so at Tsukiji kata-town. - Thanks, a lot. - No problem. Well... the time when he came here to get hot water was around eleven o'clock yesterday evening. - Are you sure? - Definitely. I live in the room below Mr. Nanjo. He was in his room after he came back from the kitchen. I see. Thanks. Hey, follow the clown over there. What do you think about it? Any interest in curing your granddaughter's eyes with this 100,000 yen? I'm not pushing you. Just help us on Tuesday. That's it. Hey, old man. We won't cause you any trouble. What do you think? We've revealed a secret to ask for your help. If you say no, we would have to be rough with you. - Are you going out? - Yes. It's going to get cold so stay safe. Park the motorboat behind this pier. Mishima's truck will be waiting here. Got it. Don't shoot recklessly. Ms. Michiyo! Your turn to go on stage. Hey, the boss wants you to stay here for a while. What? It's me. Thanks. We went through it. Hey. Oh, my god! Hello, hello? What am I going to do with you? I asked you to stay there. "Invisible Men Finally Charged With Murder" "Robbery at Shibaura Third Warehouse" "Old Watchman Tragically Died" Oh, poor girl. Invisible men are still at large. I hope they get arrested soon. I can't believe they killed such a good person. Absolutely. Who's there? Who are you? Who are you? Come out here! You must be the guy who's followed me since yesterday. - What's your purpose? - Wait. I am a news reporter. What? I'm sorry. I wanted to know the truth. That's it. You want to know? That I am an invisible man! Undoubtedly I am an invisible man. But unfortunately for you I am not the culprit. - I knew it. - What? The robbery at the jewelry store, the murder at the warehouse, you didn't do it. I am Komatsu, a news reporter. I want to do the right thing. Just that. Believe me. I see. I got carried away. No, I owe you an apology. Mr. Komatsu. You are... the first person who has trusted me. Please listen to me. I am.. a man who had his appearance as a human stolen by the military. When I came back to Japan, the land that used to be beautiful was bleeding. When I hoped to see my own mother, I didn't have an appearance. I was at a loss for what to do. My mother was terminally ill. And she finally died. I tried to... kill myself as my friend did. But even like this, I can still do something... That's what my Christian mother taught me. I believe it. I don't receive any help or bother anyone... I've been living like this as a clown. Mr. Nanjo. I don't know what to say. However, I heard your story, and now I want to help you. Thank you. But, I don't want you to publish this for a while. Until I arrest the gangs who took advantage of me to commit a crime. I understand. Please let me help you through this. Thank you. Mr. Komatsu. This monster that was created by militarism... Just for you, I will show you. So? What do you think of my appearance now? I'll use this to get back at the gangs. Welcome. - About the invisible men... - How many were they? Ah, I got something stuck in my throat. - I remember you said 4. - What do they look like? Well, they masked themselves with neckerchiefs... - Well, thanks. - Not at all. - Mr. I'm begging you! - Spare some change? The culprits who attacked here and robbed the jewelry shop are the same people. Presumably they also attacked the racetrack and the warehouse. Yes, there must be a gang deliberately using the invisible men. - Do you have any idea? - Well... - Oh, it may be... - Do you have a clue? The old man who was murdered at warehouse said that he would soon earn 100,000 yen. He was possibly murdered because of that money. This is an important clue. I'll look into it and contact you later. Please do that. I'll be waiting at the office. I got it. See you. Best of luck. Ah, you are Mr. Nanjo. Yes I am. Hi Mariko. - Christmas is in 3 days. - Yes. That is why I am folding a paper crane to place it on Grandpa's altar. The music box I promised you will be here in time for Christmas. - Wow, are you sure? - Yes, I am. By the way, there's something I want to ask you. What is it? Your grandpa said he'd soon save 100,000 yen? Yes he did. I'm really sorry, but can you show me his savings account? Sure, why not. Just as I thought. - What's wrong? - No, nothing. Hey, Mariko. Were there any unusual visitors? Yes there was, once. What were they like? Some man asked me if Grandpa was home from Michiyo's apartment across from here. - I got a bad feeling from him. - And then? - Grandpa said that he works at Kurofune. - Cabaret Kurofune? I see. Thank you. - You're leaving? - Yes, I have something to do. I'll come back soon. Hello, is this Shoyo newspaper? Could I speak with Mr. Komatsu, please. Hi Mr. Komatsu. It's Nanjo. I'd like to meet up with you. I'll be waiting at Kurofune. See you then. - What's wrong? - I bumped into someone! - No kidding. No one is here. - But... - You won't do it at any cost? - No. Then why did you go to Shibaura last night? You are the only person who knows about Shibaura. Why did you follow us? I was worried about the old man. Did you mean to interrupt our jobs? Such an idiot. If we get arrested, you'd also have to eat in jail. I think it'll be better for you to do what the boss says. You really won't accept our offer. Then you leave me with no choice. You know her. What a fool she is. She took our money and that's what she gets. You understand, don't you? You are in our group. You just have to give this to Mr. Otsuka at the station. Hey, this is your last job. Go on. Hey! What happened? I definitely bumped into someone and then the glasses on the floor started to crack one by one. It must be the invisible men! Don't be stupid. Actually, it was me who bumped you. The next stop is 3rd Street. Hey, look at that! It's the invisible man! - Run everybody! - Hurry up! - Don't open the door! - It's inside the train! You must be... - Oh, a lady is still inside! - Help her out! I'm Nanjo, the clown. You're in danger. Those bad guys are pulling you in. You must escape. - Call the police! - Move out! - Why did you follow me? - I just want to help you out. Believe me. I'm on your side. Please wait at the music hall in Shibuya. I will be there. I have something to tell you. It's going to run away! Chase it! Come out! Where is it? Mr. Nanjo. I'm glad you came. You must be surprised that I am an invisible man. Yes. Actually, of all people I didn't want you to know. But, it can't be helped now. Ms. Michiyo. You must run away from your current life. Is it funny that an invisible man is telling you this? What do you think? I know the truth. You are innocent. Your name was just being used by them. Thank you. Then, you understand what I mean. Yes, but... It's too late for me. When I realized what happened, I was already caught in a horrible trap. No, you can escape from it if you want to. Ms. Michiyo, can we not live by helping each other out? What? What I am saying is neither socializing nor dating. - How can I put it? - Mr. Nanjo... Why can't we socialize with each other? - Why? - Because I am disabled. No, you are not alone. I am also deprived of freedom. Mr. Nanjo. Help me, please. Your luck ran out when you showed yourself. However, you are still useful to us. I'd like you to come with us. How's that? Still not giving up? You really don't want to join our team? Bastard! Ken. - Trash him at Ginza. - What? He will be hit by a car somewhere. Once the dead body of the invisible man appears, he will take all the blame for what we did. I see. I prefer a place that attracts people's attention. Hey, get a station wagon! Undress him! This guy creeps me out. Hey Sanpei, wipe his face. Me? Of course. Do it like you're taking care of your wife. Open the door when we get close to 4th Street. Yes. 1, 2, 3! Come in. Hey there. Mr. Hasebe. The culprit of the Shibaura case... Don't worry about it. We have a pretty good idea. The culprit is related to cabaret Kurofune. Komatsu investigated and there is sufficient evidence. Oh, thank you. Hey, you. We know it as you heard. No matter how you use the right of silence, you cannot elude the police. How was that? Boss, we did well. Well, good job. Go on, have a drink first. Ginza's probably in a frenzy by now! Well, now we're all right for the time being. We raked in a lot of money lately, it's a good time to take a break. Drink up! You bastard! Watch out! - Oh? - What's this? - Hey, Boss, look behind you. - What? Watch out! Get down from there! - Mr. Nanjo! - Be careful! Stay away! Or else! I'll turn Tokyo into a sea of fire! Don't do it! It's too dangerous. Mr. Nanjo! Mr. Nanjo. Mr. Nanjo. Mr. Nanjo. - Ms. Michiyo. - Stay with me! This is right... for a man like me. More importantly, take care of Mariko... I can hear the music box. As I expected, did the clown uncle bring it for me? THE END
